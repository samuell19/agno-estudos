How does it work? Today is February 15. I bought this video camera so I could film Loulou, sleeping in his room. There. So I... am going to... go to his room, quietly... so I don't wake him up. This is his door. This is Loulou. He's fifteen months old. It's 2 PM, and his mother's at work. I moved the mike... to hear him breathe. There, Loulou's breathing real well. This is my first film of Loulou. He' asleep. Oblivious to his surroundings. THE SEPARATION Subtitles: Eric Collins Processed by Laser Vid√©o Titres - Paris Wait, you say you've not changed, but you have a maid now. Not a maid, a nanny. Oh, I see. She's a friend. You don't pay her. Of course I pay her. Also... your friends can't just drop by anymore. Except for you, that's true. We don't always drop by! No sit-ins anymore! You don't either! Do you go to the Worker's Feast? I've never been there, ever. You've never been? No. I never really had the opportunity. A big mistake! Because it's the best place to get girls. Here come the old stories again! No need to talk them up even. Oh, well... Claire... she hates it when we talk about women who liked me. Stop smoking, you don't know how! I know how, I just don't swallow the smoke. You don't smoke if you don't swallow. What am I doing then? You're just puffing on it. You want me to swallow so I cough? Why start at forty? That's when people stop. It shows courage! Shall we go? Stop it! I'm watching the film. Don't wake Loulou later. Why would I wake him? Just be careful. Hi, Laurence. All okay? Yes, but he wouldn't go to bed. You worked? A little bit. What happened at the movies? You bothered me during the film. I only took your hand. It's annoying. I wanted to watch the film. You'd seen it before. Wait, I said I was happy to see it again. So, why... A fight over not taking your hand? Find another reason. Come to bed. It's 8 AM. Loulou had his bottle. His mother's sleeping. I'm going to... experiment... Loulou is playing with his bike. I'm trying to pick him... To pick him up under my arm, while I... film. Here we go. We're exiting the room. We're going down the corridor. We're going by the living room. Loulou is quiet. We're creeping up to his mother's room. I'm trying to open the door. It's Loulou! It's my Loulou! I opened the shutters to let the sun in. Loulou is kissing his mother. His mother is happy. She says hi to daddy. Good bye, daddy. Laurence? You're free at noon? Of course. Can we have lunch? Okay, if you want. I dressed him. Put his cap on if you go out. I always do. Bye, Loulou, bye honey. I won't be back before 8 PM. Have him take his bath. I'll be here! Come and get me at... 1 PM? Careful, my lipstick. Bye! - I have to go. - Wait a bit, okay? It's been a long time. We haven't been here for a year now. I used to be here every day! I'd sit over there to draw. It was my office. Whereas now... And your book? It's a bit slow really... It's not finished? It should be, but... it's not that easy! - I know it isn't. - It's not easy. I mean... I don't like it when you... Stop it. Each time we talk about work, you get upset. So let's forget it! I didn't come to discuss my book. Why then? I wonder! Can I dunk? How about tonight? When does it start? I don't know. Around 10 PM. Hey, if you don't want to... No, no, we'll go! Shall we meet at home? That's fine. Okay. Sorry, I don't know what's with me. I'm just not well. I'm a pain. No, not really! But I'll get over it. I'll get over it. I've got to run. I'm late! See you tonight. See you tonight! Love stories all start out wonderful, and delicious. It's after they go to the dogs. When Victor and I took separate apartments, the idea wasn't his. If I hadn't insisted we'd still be bickering. Remember how we fought! I can't take that anymore. 'Cause in my job I see so many people who aren't made to be together. Some don't even talk anymore. It's horrid! You know, I saw this article. A woman in California, rigged a mike in her home, to record everything, because her husband never spoke to her. Well, the dialog was copied down, and it gave something like this: 7:02 "Hello, you sleep well?" No answer. 7:53 "Coming home late?" No answer. It went on like that all day. Her husband never answered. She went to court, and won a whole bundle. Hey, it's not the same. Hold on, I'm not comparing this to you! Are you joking? Don't pull that face! You're having a crisis. It's your first? Every couple goes through crises. It's normal. No, it's okay. I hope so. Put the car here. - You're late. - It's 9. No, it's 9:20. Okay, it's 9:20. You want a bath now? Let me be. It must be here. We didn't bring champagne. "We"? Why are you always nagging me? You okay? I thought you'd never come. You can put your stuff there. Hi, Pierre. You okay? Fine, fine. What you up to? I'm finishing a book. Anne's here? Anne, yes... See you. No, it's not what you think. I ate with your wife. Yup, two weeks ago, we had lunch. She didn't tell her private life, but we were eating Chinese, and the way she was dipping her spring roll told a lot about her sex life. Wait, I haven't finished... Wait, I'm not over. Happy birthday! Happy birthday Jean-Pierre! Pierre, I have something to tell you. I think... I fell in love with someone. - See you tomorrow. - Bye. Say something. I seem to be taking things pretty well, but what you said hasn't sunk in yet. But when... What? When I told you I met another man. Well? What did you think? What did I think? Nothing. You don't think in a case like that. You wonder if you're dreaming. After, on the bike, I thought about the party... About Claire, who must've wondered where we went. About all those people, who seemed so nice. They seemed to be having fun. And now, what am I thinking? I feel it'll be... That things will be very difficult between us. We can do ourselves in, or pull through. We won't do ourselves in! You think so? I'm sure of it. Say, I'd like to know... What did I do wrong? Nothing. You won't say? It's nothing specific. Just a lot of little things. Tell me. I don't know. Maybe we didn't talk enough. By not talking we put up with things we shouldn't have. You could've told me. -I did. - Not like this. I did, in a different way. You just wouldn't listen. That's too much. What? You're saying that... If you fell in love with this guy, I'm to blame. Of course not. You didn't get it. I don't know. Maybe... I don't know. Maybe it's because I expect too much out of life. I don't have anything specific against you. It's just... I met someone who listens to me. Who's interested in me. Who pays attention to me. That's all! I don't want you to be sad, I didn't want to hurt you. Listen, when we say we know women, well, we do know one or two, and those... we know only too well! But the others... They're pure mystery. Because no two women work the same way! I don't know. Listen. I say I didn't see it coming, but this last fortnight, she wasn't nagging me. Normally, we bicker all the time. Over the same things: not turning out the lights, or the TV. But this last fortnight: nothing. That's how I understood something big was going on. Whether she slept with this guy or not, whether she wants to or not, isn't important. What's important is that I feel that... That she's not there. That I'm no longer crucial to her. That hurts. Why do you think she likes this guy? She likes him because they haven't slept together. We're all the same: me, you, her... We all react the same. When they'll have slept together, you see... It'll be different. They won't feel the same desire. It's hard on you, but it'd be best for you if they did it right away. To see if it's just physical. Unless... - Unless? - They already have! No, they haven't. Listen, it's weird, because, if they haven't, it's cruel. Listen, I don't want to question... what she says. I trust her. I trust her. Listen. How can I say. Since she told me, we pretend as if... we live as though she never told me. As though this guy didn't exist. And all this waiting... makes me sick. When you think that people used to mate as they wanted. In total freedom! It must've been great! Then, a guy wanted a woman for himself. He said: "She's all mine!" That was the first love. You can't blame him, he had no idea. But the 2nd guy, he's got no excuse! Right on! Look, Loulou. Mommy's back. Hi, honey. How's my Loulou? Fine! How about you? I'm okay. A bit tired. Tired? Red. White. Red. He's asleep? I saw Victor. He... How is he? Well, I didn't ask. That's not how you wash lettuce. Move over. Actually, Victor seemed fine. He wanted to know if... We're still seeing that country home this weekend? What did you say? I said I'd ask you, but that it was still on. Right? Yeah, it's still on. Did I tell you that I'm eating out tomorrow? With whom? - You could've told me! - I am. I mean, earlier! What's the difference? At what time do you see him? I meet him at 9 PM. Why? - Are you coming by here? - Of course. Why? Because... Well... I can't ask you not to see this guy. That's up to you. But me, I don't want to know who he is, or how you meet. I don't want to see you get ready. Getting ready for him. Tomorrow, I won't be here when you come by. We'll ask Laurence to baby-sit Loulou. I can't take it. The other day you said you loved a guy. Well, you freed yourself of a weight. You got it out, but now... That weight, I... Oh, damn! Stop eating my sweater. Stop! I'm going. Mommy? She's gone! Look! See what he did? That's really interesting. It's hot. Let's take the sweater off. Wait, that's better. Isn't that a nice car? Hold the book. There. He fell down! Mathieu fell down! He fell down. Laurence, it's Pierre. Everything okay? Did Anne come by? Tell her I called, and that I'll be back around 9 PM. No, just say I called to see if everything was okay. Thanks, Laurence. See you later. It's midnight. I'm not asleep. Anne isn't back yet. Every time, like tonight, when I... when I can't sleep, or wake up in the middle of the night, every time I'm sleepless, well... I go into his room, to see... To see Loulou sleep. There. I often sit near him. And just watch him. - You're awake? - No... Yes... I snoozed for an hour. You're hungry? A little... well, not really. There's not much to eat! Where did you... two... eat? We went to Stresa's. That's nice. Yes, it was really good. And after? After dinner, I took a cab back. He didn't drive you? No. He didn't. Something's up, right? Or you wouldn't be like this with me. How come? Since you met that guy, you're sweet with me! Bastard! That's it, I'm the bastard! We have exited the tunnel, and are heading towards Normandy. Victor is driving. I won't let him by! In the back... there's Claire, and Loulou, of course, and Anne, who's here too. Look! There, happy images just like any holiday images! He's happy now? All the rooms communicate. This door is an example. You can go through it, and onto the stairs. The whole house works that way. This is the entranceway, and this door - with our communication system - this door leads into the living room! The kitchen. How much does it cost? For July? Give mommy a kiss. A big kiss. So? It's nice, huh? Not bad, but a bit too big. We could rent it with other friends. Yeah, other friends. Stupid! We could rent a house like this all year round. You and Loulou could rest. We could swim in summer. You're serious? - You hate it. - Hate what? Weekends, the sea! I don't! You'd be bored in a week. Why do you say that? I know you so well. Yeah, that's right! Listen, it's true. I mean, outside of Paris you're lost. - It's fun? - Yes. It's difficult? - You wanna try? - No! No, I don't want to. Wait, it's difficult. What do I do? Hold on tight. Pull right... - Don't let go. - No. Pull left... Try and go up. Now we corkscrew... - It's tough. - Look out. It pulls hard... Wait, we'll land... There. Man, it's tough. Do it alone now. No, I don't want to. No! Wait, it's real tough. No, you're fine. Listen... I'm letting go. No, it's fine. Listen, I told you. Why did you... It's too tough. Jerk! It's not hard to fly a kite. Don't speak to me like that. Asshole. What'll knowing him change? Nothing. What'll it change? I don't know. Trust her. I do. I want to know if we've a chance of pulling through. How do I know? Do we have a chance? Of course you do. Of course. A fair chance? What can I say? What? I don't know. What? Ask her. Do you two talk? Yeah, we talk all the time! But it's no good. The more we talk, the more sore points we find. In the daily life, all the little things have become hard to say. In the morning, I can't say: "See you tonight". And when she's home, I can't ask her how her day went. It sounds fake. It's fake. It's soft. Soft. You're doing good, honey. Not your fingers! I'm smeared! Eat by yourself. You okay? What did you want? You saw Marie! Yes, we had lunch. Why didn't you tell me? I don't need to. I don't need to tell you what I do. I don't ask you what you do, who you see! Don't hide things from me. Don't involve Marie. What? She knew about it before I did! Are you spying on me? I feel spied upon. Look! Stop it! You want me to show you? It's not difficult. I can know who you phoned. Stop! If we keep on like this, always fighting, we'll do ourselves in. I don't know anymore. Should I talk or keep quiet. Should I go or stay. I'm doing everything backwards. I disgust myself. You disgust me too. So maybe we're at the end. The end of our story. But if that's true, we have to say so. We have to split up. How can you say that? I never said I wanted to leave you, that I don't love you. Don't go. I don't want a separation. Who said I wanted to go? You did. No, I said we had to consider a separation. I'm not going. You'd have to go. You scaring me? Not at all. We can talk about separation and not be scared. A couple's a transient thing. It doesn't last forever. You just have to know that. A separation... A short separation... might be our chance. Don't you think so? I don't know. Maybe if we... took some time off from one another, we'd find an answer. Right? I don't know. Maybe you're right. Actually... I don't know! I don't know. You're right. What's great about living apart... Which glasses? The tall ones. Fine. ...is that I can put my wine in her cellar. My cellar is useless. Taste this. It's better than champagne. Real better. Nice taste, huh! Delicious! It's great. - Like it? - It's fine. It's Pierre. Anne's here? She been here long? 45 minutes. How is she? - What? - She's okay? Oh, no problem. She's fine. Did you decide about the house for this summer. For summer? Oh, no. It's way too early... I've no idea what we'll do. I'm sorry I'm late. It's okay. You okay? - And you? - Fine. About the starters should we... I waited an hour for Laurence. When did you ask her to come? I didn't. Great! It's your job. You see her all day. You usually do it. Not this time. I waited one whole hour. For once that you're with Loulou. I don't see him enough? I didn't say that. You wanted to come straight here. For once that I can. I should see him more? No, it's fine like this. - What is it? - Nothing. - What! - Nothing! You mean something. No, it's fine. I like taking care of him. I like feeding him, and changing diapers in the morning. Everything's fine. It's fine! What do you want? I don't want anything. Here. Well, Claire and I, wanted to tell you... What's wrong, Claire? Nothing. What? Well, Claire and I are going to get married. That's your only reaction. I dunno... I'm just surprised. I didn't expect this. It's a joke? It's not a joke. We're serious. Why get married? For the normal reasons. We're not original. We put it off several times. We already wanted to. 3 years ago, when we took our apartment. But why now? Because... Maybe we couldn't before. We weren't mature enough. When we reach our stage of a relationship, it's the obvious thing. And for his parents, it's... His parents! You know how they are! They never asked for anything. They're really old. One day they'll die. I thought they'd be happy... At 40 you don't marry to please them! I'm not getting married for them. This doesn't seem to make you happy. No... You're upset that... Listen, I only want to understand. Understand what? You live together. Why get married? I understand it seems odd. Your questions are okay. Even we are hesitating. What? What? Hesitating? It's great you're getting married. What? I find your defense of marriage unexpected! Why unexpected? Why unexpected? You have... I have what? Gall? Stop it. I can't say that? You can. You can do what you want. Did I ever stop you? Even once? Leave, Anne. Leave. Found her? I gotta go home. She mustn't think I'm leaving her and Loulou alone. I'm sorry, Pierre. Cut it out. It's not our fault! It isn't. You wanna stay? No, I've gotta go. Anne's back? No. She just called. What'd she say? She asked if you were back, and said not to wait for her. She'll call back? I don't think so. Fine. Loulou's asleep? Yes. Since 8 or 8:30 PM. I'll be going. You leaving? I've gotta go. As you want. See you tomorrow. Shall I come earlier, or as... usual? No. Come... Come as usual. Okay. See you tomorrow. I thought something'd happened. Don't do that: leaving without news. Don't be scared. I'm back. I'm still here. But I waited all night long. Remember, in the beginning, you said that you'd leave if I asked you to. So, tonight, I'm asking you. Choose: either you stay, or you leave. I can't ask you to dump him, I've no right to. But if you want him, then you've got to go. - Don't stay. - You're hurting me. I'm staying with Loulou! It'll take time, but you'll leave. You understand, I can't live like this. Let go, you're hurting me! You gonna leave? Let go! - You gonna leave? - Let go! You gonna leave? You're hurting me! What's wrong with you? Leave! I'm not going! It's my home too. I'm not going. You're crazy! Totally crazy! Yeah, I'm crazy! I'm crazy about him. Last month I loved her and she loved me. Now I'm with someone I... I don't understand. A total stranger. I don't get it. How'd we become like this? In such a short time. In such a short time you can end up not loving one another, hating one another. Who can explain that to me! Don't ask me. Especially not now. I'm messing everything up. I'm telling you. You know I'm unable to put myself in someone else's shoes. I can't. I have opinions, mind you, on everything. But when it comes to giving advice, I only manage with my students. I only see them 4 hours a week, but it's different. I can think, make speeches, help them. Well, when I say helping them... The other day, I met one of my students' mother. I tried to find out what her daughter thinks of my classes. All she'd told her mom was: "Our philosophy teacher," "he's changed shirts twice this year!" I'm talking 12th grade here! You study Spinoza's concept of freedom, and you get: "Mom, our philosophy teacher," "he's changed shirts twice this year!" I know the last thing you find out is how others see you. But it flips me out! Why was I saying that? You see, I'm useless. Here you are with your screwed up couple, and I gab on about my students. I should be saying: "Fight on, man. Don't give up!" Or I could say the opposite. I'm totally depressing. Not at all. I'm so negative, it must be depressing. No, not at all. Really? No, I don't think so. Really? I know you so well. Hi, kitten! Hi! I've been looking for you. Not too cold? No. So, kitten, having a nice day? Did you eat? Did he? You wanna go with me? Shall I come? No, we'll just wander around. Thanks, Laurence. Listen, in a few seconds, this champagne cooler, will become your gift! Champagne for everybody! Champagne for everybody! Stop it. It's dirty. Cookie! Cookie! But you had some already. Here. The last one. No, stop playing with that. We're home, Loulou! Oh, mommy's here. Let's go give mommy a kiss. You happy? What? I come home, and nobody's here. I phoned Victor, Laurence, Claire... To find where you were! Listen! I was about to phone the cops and the hospitals! Can't I go for a walk with Loulou now? Don't mix everything up! He's not washed, he won't eat! He will! You can talk, you never feed him! Cut it out! As though I never take care of Loulou! You never wake up for him! Listen, stop pretending I don't exist! You sure exist! That's the problem! Get out! Go live your life! Leave Loulou and me alone! I won't go! All this shit because Loulou'll have a late bath, while we're about to split up! I saw a lawyer. He's mine. You'll see him every other weekend. Why is Loulou at your mom's? Let go! Are you crazy? So you can screw here? Slut! You crazy? So you can screw? And not be bothered? You're disgusting. I took him away so he wouldn't see this. Look at you! Pitiful. It's pitiful! Don't touch me! Don't touch me! Go away! Go away! Coffee? Well, it'll be a weak one. I forgot to buy coffee, so we'll have this brown water here. It won't keep you awake, because you sure look like you didn't sleep much! You said Anne phoned. When? Around 7 or 8. Did she say something about...? She said you two quarreled, and you left. She wanted to know if you were here. I couldn't say, I didn't know where you were. It's clear-cut. You're not married, but how old's the child? Eighteen months. Then the mother gets him. She's not a druggy, or a hooker? No? Don't take a lawyer. It'll be useless. Don't fight it. She said, every other weekend? That's the deal! No? Why not with grandma? Look out, baby. Want to see the sand? What did you see? Loulou'll be 18 months in a few days. I'll have seen him grow up, have taught him to sit... to eat, and walk... To talk too, because he can say a few words now. But I won't teach him how to draw, or to write. He'll learn without me. And I'll have to learn... To learn to live without him. To live without you. To learn not to change sidewalks when I go by schools and toy shops. To put up with people who talk about kids. I won't escape that. One day, some nerd like me, will show me the picture of his kid: "He's not at his best here," "he's a lot cuter!" I'll say: "Yes, I can see that." Then, I'll try to talk about something else, to change the conversation. Am I bothering you? You have time? Of course. Shall we go somewhere? I've been thinking. You shouldn't go. I'm the one that has to go. Listen, let's not stay here. Come on, let's go somewhere. I thought of you in the toilet. Someone wrote: "In a couple one suffers while the other one's bored." Someone added: "And vice-versa." So you thought of me? - It's funny. - Sure. You know what... I forgot who... said about couples? "Never 2 without 3." Real nice. Well, it sure is fitting. Talking about... Let's say "Never 2 without 3", I think, well I can tell you... Funny how everything's easy to say now! So? I have two things to say. First... Before deciding to leave, I hesitated a lot. The worse bit was to think that... That "Never 2 without 3" could... come to the apartment, and have the keys, and replace me alongside Loulou! You'd not like that? Not at all! It won't happen. What's the second thing? The second thing... I forgot. That's okay. It was important, but... I have two things to say. The first is... Well, it's a memory. One never knows why you fall in love, but... The first time we ate at your place, you said you never cooked, but you wanted to for me. That touched me. You don't remember? Go on... I came, and the table was set, with all the silverware out. It was so refined! And then, you got up, and I went into the kitchen. There, over the sink, on the wall, was a piece of paper. You'd written: "6:10 Light..." No. "6:00 Light the oven." "6:10 Cook the meat. 6:20 Peel the carrots." And it went on until: "8:30 Anne arrives!" That list moved me. It wasn't like you at all, but you were trying your best. It could've put me off, I could've found it ridiculous, but I found it moving. When I came back, I wanted to talk about it. I never did. I don't remember. What else did you want to say? The second thing... The guy we talked about, it's over. It's over for good. And what was your second thing? I forgot. It's not important. I don't want to go up. Why not? I'd rather not. Don't stay here. Come on. Laurence? It's me. Really, I... I don't think I'll go up. You should see Loulou! No... I won't be able to leave if I see Loulou. Just a minute? What am I going to do? Sit down, have a drink. I'll feel as though I'm a visitor. You'll go to Victor's? You can stay here a bit. I know. Feel free. I'll see. In case Victor kicks me out! Well, come whenever you want. To see Loulou, to see me. You've got the keys. Yeah, okay. You understand? Yeah, I understand. Because, I don't want... I don't want you to... I bathed him, fed him, and put him to bed. Fine. If you need me, for Loulou, or... Don't hesitate. The door! Pierre, what are you doing here? I'm lost. How about you? I took the bus, when I saw you. I made you miss the bus? It's okay. I'm looking for a cab stand. I thought... So I didn't look where I was going. I wound up in these little streets. I got lost. Is it this way? No, that way. That way. You want me to come? You sure? No, I'll find it. Thanks. Taxi!
