WILL THERE BE A REFORM OF MAN? WILL THE NEW MAN RETAIN CERTAIN OLD ORGANS? I'm sure you must be interested in sex, and it's a good thing. It would be sad if you weren't. I too am very interested in sex - as a subject of study, of course. AUTHOR OF MEDICAL SEXOLOGY AND SEXUAL KNOWLEDGE Sex is perhaps more whispered about than spoken of openly. But we don't know enough about these whisperings. If we could only find out more, we'd know just how great people's interest in sex is. In ancient times, sexuality was understood in a different way. This was especially evident in the custom of worshiping the sex organs. For example, a male sex organ 40 feet high, gilded and ornamented, was paraded around, accompanied by music and beautiful girls. And no one protested, not even the girls who followed this gigantic 40-foot-tall phallus. Or take the case of the Euphrates Valley, where they'd raise up huge phalli, or male members, measuring 180 feet high. A special priest called a "phallobath" - he even has a name - would climb up twice a year and remain at the top of such a phallus for seven days. Similarly, in India... coupled organs, male and female, formed an integral part of the altar.

Hello, Zajecar? Is that Mijovic? You have a call from Murska Sobota. We're trying, darling, we're trying. Kragujevac can wait. I have three calls from Croatia. ?ura ?akovic, Slavonski Brod. What private address? It's a factory. Obrenovac, hold on. Sremska Mitrovica, Po?arevac is calling. Po?arevac. Answer, will you? Waiting for an invitation? Miss, you're like Napoleon. He could read, think, and piss, all at the same time. Svetozarevo, how's that famous beer of yours? Your transport, miss. A motorized lover! Get lost, you fucking jerk. I could give you such a ride! And Sufrain, the driver at the Ethiopian embassy. Child of darkest Africa. African-style, sister. A prince, so help me. What a pleasure, having a professional work on your feet. All I got from traipsing around with that bum with no car is corns. I had Njegovan, a literature student from Lika. He wrote me poems. How did that go? "Ru?ka, my dewy flower, I've dedicated a poem to you... about wild flesh." Buddy, could you whiten these for me quickly? Three hundred. And a new dinar for quick service. Money's worthless these days. It was during the European Athletics Championships. He was a bashful blond. You'd think he didn't know a thing. But once he started, he couldn't stop. He really gave you a good time. In the morning, when we came out, dawn was breaking. Everything was a sort of white mist before my eyes. I felt like the Virgin Mary. You know my Mihajlo, who played folk tunes on the accordion? He was a good person, but he was too into his music - the "Nightingale of ?umadija." Dragan Stojnic, you little sweetheart! I adore him. Look - the Chinese. Yugoslavia, born of struggle Your people sing of your glory Our nation, filled with our love Be proud, Yugoslavia We didn't introduce ourselves. My pleasure. Bu?atlija, Ahmed. Izabela Garodi. Excuse me? Ga-ro-di. This is my friend Ru?a. Bu?atlija. Call me Ru?ka. Why don't we drop in at the Seaman's Tavern? They've redecorated. - Sure. - Only if they've got draft beer. I like drinking from a stein. With lots of foam. Your wish is my command. Bodies of crime victims are hidden in a wide variety of places. Criminals often take their victims to secluded spots under various pretexts, convinced that without witnesses a crime will not be discovered. For example, the body may be buried, carved up, burnt, thrown in a river or hidden in a well. A body usually decomposes in water, but cold well water can retard the decaying process, facilitating cleaning of the head for identification purposes. This cleaning is performed in the following manner. ; Layers of mud and algae are removed, the hair is combed, lacerations are sutured, the face is made up, the eyelids are opened, and glycerin is injected into the eyes to restore their natural sparkle. The criminal always seeks to make a "leap into the void," driven by his instinct for self-preservation. In a word, he wishes to enjoy undetected the fruits of his crime. SENIOR FELLOW INSTITUTE OF CRIMINOLOGY Advances in science and technology enable certain criminals to enrich their imagination and intelligence, thus subverting civilization's achievements to the service of evil. Paradoxical as it sounds, crime is being perfected and is more and more a function of intelligence and less a matter of force and fist. It was once enough for a criminal to catch a train or boat at the very last moment to escape justice, but with modern advances, he can't feel safe anywhere. Wherever he goes, whatever he does, he'll leave enough traces for the Argus-like eyes of criminologists to find him. The way he ties a rope to hang or strangle a victim, or, in burglary cases, the prints of shoes, socks or naked feet on a wood floor - all these are calling cards left behind for investigating officers that prevent criminals from realizing their unattainable dream - the perfect crime. Disposing of his victim's body is one of a murderer's greatest challenges. A murderer will often stare long and hard at the motionless body, straining his brain for a way to get rid of the corpse. The human body is made up of an enormous number of substances. Blood poses an insurmountable problem for criminals. Teeth and bones are very durable. That fact helped our colleague Vodinelic solve the infamous case of the Podravina skull. And our experts Dr. Milcinski and Dr. Sava Gorkic superimposed an unidentified skull upon photographs of unidentified bodies to successfully answer the first of the seven golden questions in criminology: "Who?" You have to taste this. Barack palinka - apricot brandy. A Hungarian specialty. Are you - I can tell by your accent. Hungarian? Yes, but of the domestic variety. My brother in Budapest sent it along with Mr. Frankovic, manager of the Sleeping Car Company, the SCC. Cheers. That's a real disinfectant. I like a good clean job. Smells like apricots, doesn't it? You're not married, are you? No. You know, I lived here with my mother until six months ago. Then she had some kind of rupture, and she was gone. I couldn't do much here, if you get my drift. I couldn't bring company here. I've been renting ever since I can remember. The army was a mother and stepmother to me. I was an orphan. My father went abroad in search of work and vanished. I went straight from the medical corps into sanitation. It's been ten years already. Let's have some coffee. Neither burner is working, but we'll manage somehow. Other than that, I'm very upstanding. I don't drink. I'm a Party member. Clean and meticulous. I go on a binge once a year at most, when things get to be too much. One teaspoon or two? One. And I thought you were an officer, something along those lines. Izabela, you're a real tease. Cheers. Please come in the other room. There's a good program on TV. Would you hold this? Thanks. Thanks. It's more intimate this way. Don't you agree? CLOSE THE CHURCHES! Izabela, you're quite a little homemaker. Just so you know: I've gone two months without a man, and that's too long for a Hungarian girl. There's this guy in our collective named Pi?ta Baci. He tells these jokes about Hungarian girls - filthy jokes - and I imagined all sorts of things. What do you mean by that? The stories men tell. You know - jokes and such. So you didn't like me? Don't be silly, woman. What did I say? "Pretty as a fairy princess with hair like silk." Who's that? Nobody. Just the milkman. Tell me, are you single all the time? Not all the time. I'm just too honest. I don't know how to lie to women. But believe me... you're the first modern girl... that I've hitched up with like this. That was nice, what you said about my hair. And my skin is like velvet too. Female, 20-25 years old, 5'3" tall. Bones and muscles of average development, of average nourishment. Skin color: Grayish white. Facial skin blistered and lacerated in spots. Outer ear channels, nostrils, and mouth contain sand and green, moss-like, mucous threads. Right shoulder area shows lacerations and a hematoma the size of a child's palm. Skin under right elbow shows punctures in the form of bite marks. Eyelids swollen, with pronounced changes due to decay. Conjunctiva clouded and grayish, with grains of sand and above-mentioned fibrous threads. Iris is light blue. Uterine cavity contains fetus with lining, approximately three months old. Brain tissue exhibits well-developed structure. Right temporal area shows hematoma the size of a palm. Conclusion: Violent death by drowning, which, based on the above findings, was preceded by physical assault. The threat posed to man by rats has still not been fully grasped here. Rats devour enormous quantities of food and other goods. They eat winter coats, entire libraries of books, corpses in autopsy rooms, even film stock. In 1725, an earthquake and unprecedented famine set great masses of rats on the march out of Asia. Huge armies of the berserk little creatures reached the Caspian Sea, swam across the Volga, and inundated the European part of Russia. By 1750 their advance guard had reached Silesia. After that, traveling along roadways and later railways, the gray rat conquered one region after another. At first, Europe welcomed these uninvited newcomers, figuring that the gray rat would help exterminate the black rat, which had ravaged Europe since the Crusades. The gray rat and black rat fought to the death. Being stronger, tougher, and more bloodthirsty, the gray rat prevailed. The rat is in many ways more resilient than man. There are currently three million of them in Belgrade, 60 million throughout Yugoslavia. It's still unclear who will rule the Earth in 100 years. ; people or rats. One pair of rats produces 1,000 descendants in one year. Our rat extermination units - advance guard of the human race - wage a fierce battle to safeguard man's living space against rats. THERE'S A PANTRY FULL OF CHEESE AND THE RAT EATS THE CHEESE NICE AS YOU PLEASE THE RAT EATS THE CHEESE HIS MIND'S AT EASE WHILE HE HAS HIS CHEESE BUT INTO THE RAT COMES A DISEASE THAT SNEAKS OUT FROM THE CHEESE AND STARTS SCREWING WITH HIS EASE IT SCREWS WITH HIS EASE SCREWING AND SCREWING IT BRINGS HIM TO HIS KNEES IT'S A BELLYACHE HE CAN'T ABIDE AS IF HE GOT A SCREW INSIDE LIFE'S AT AN END IT'S TIME HE DIED I THINK I KNOW HOW IT MUST BURN WHEN THAT SCREW BEGINS TO TURN Bachelors are always at the bottom of the heap. I live here modestly. I'm no big shot or one of those pushy types, but when it comes to fighting rats, Ahmed's your man. You live like in that novel Wuthering Heights. Eve. And you're Suleiman the Magnificent. Put on some clothes. What's that? You're so cramped here. I found what I was looking for: A hen's egg. What do you think of when you see a hen's egg? Hens don't lay eggs just so people can make omelets. This egg represents the most highly developed reproductive cell of the female sex. Within this cell the germ of life is already present, the "spark," as the common folk say. This germ illustrates how organs develop, including in the human being. This is the most powerful element in all our science: To know the mechanism by which all our organs, nervous system, blood and heart develop. When you understand this, I'm sure you won't think of omelets anymore when you see a hen's egg. My Mohammed! Mujo! Throw me some clothespins from the closet. Right away. Song of songs, rise up to the sun That shines on the march of the Red column What's that, for God's sake? Comrades from the German Democratic Republic gave us some records. I immediately bought a record player. O land, be ready! Onward, O time! O land of lands, forward in assault! Crush into dust rotten vermin! Bravely into struggle! Onward, O time! Be joyful, O land to the future sworn The Commune stands at the gate To your oath be true! Onward, O time! We're all sticky. Meho, you sure know what's good for a body. Am I a good Turk or not? What was that? I didn't get a word. Do you like it? Know what it says? It goes like this: "Half of 100 forints is 50. To hell with it. Man's not made of wood. He can fail once in a while." Then it goes on: "I kiss my girl on the mouth." "However, slaughterhouses and granaries, along with roads, offer the most attractive targets of invasion for rats." The things you're involved with! Meho decided to surprise you. This is Master Rade. Hello. Please come in. Hey... what's that? A record player. The walls are good and sturdy. They'll hold. Or maybe we should put it here? We'll put the drain down here. Easy there! What are you doing, lifting that alone? Here we go. That's it. Go over there. Shock-workers. Careful you don't scrape it, or the paint will chip. Set it down. - To our health. - Cheers. You're not drinking? - One more? - A little later. An expert job. Come wash my back. Hey, I didn't say there! Interestingly enough, there's not one great artist, great poet or great writer who did not deal with the most ticklish sexual matters. The great painters - Rembrandt, let us say... as well as others - depicted the sexual act. Few people are aware of that. One of our own artists painted an extraordinary painting that I greatly admire, which in essence is perhaps extremely pornographic, if one looks at it that way, depicting the sexual act in all its forms. It's a picture by our great painter ?orde Andrejevic Kun, a painting first exhibited 30 years ago. It depicts, without the slightest prudery, parents engaged in the sexual act in a room where children are playing and a meal's being cooked as an integral part of a certain way of life. His point is to show us not so much the sexual act as the fact that all activities take place in that same setting. That's one example of something that certainly might appear pornographic but is not. One... two... three... he captures your heart. One... two... three... a uniform. You'll go on a journey. Secretly, at night. Fooling around. A bed. I'm not putting you on. I don't believe it. Think what you like, but I really love him. I'm serious. So maybe he is a bit of a homebody. We hardly ever go out. Well, dark eyes are dark eyes, a heart means love - even if it's a little love - but there's no mistake, my friend. It's your fate. Gimme another bite. Take the whole thing. Are you free tonight, miss? - Unfortunately no. - Too bad. What are you doing tonight? Giving my kids a bath. Pity. - For me? - Sure is, handsome. Thanks. Miss, I am Mica, postman of death and joy, bearer of urgent telegrams. It's a special service calling for speed and finesse. When I show up, people immediately start crying or celebrating, showering me with tips or pressing me to stay for dinner. I live like our delegations abroad. Hello, Petrovac na Mlavi? Give me military post 69. When I want a girl, she can't say no. - Who is it? - The wool thrasher. "Guess who I am. Quilt-making's my game. I live in a cottage down the lane. I have two sons, Andrija and Slobodan by name." Got anything to thrash? - I do. Let's go downstairs. - Lead the way, sunshine. "I thrash wool, and my darling's no fool." Master Aca, member of the Socialist League, thrashes wool for party members and nonmembers alike. "My cock does a lot. It glues you on the spot. It makes you wet and hot, and in a jiffy you're caught!" I see you thrash wool. Could you thrash this quilt? Sure. Want me to thrash you too? Oh, I was thrashed long ago, my friend. This tooth really hurts. Look, this one. My God! You should get that filled. Don't let it rot on you. I know a great dentist. He made me some fantastic teeth. Look. You think you're really something. Miss Izabela, you don't know me at all. I admit that certain sexual adventures do happen to me, but not through any depravity of mine. Say I bring a joyful telegram from a husband overseas. The wife weeps with joy. The telegram gets soaked. She offers me liqueur-filled bonbons. She hugs and kisses me. - You don't say. It's not my doing. It's the postal service's fault. My boyfriend's off on a work assignment. I might not see him for a whole month. Screw this life! People aren't made of wood, especially not me. So what if it's a night call? Give me Po?ega 64. That's right - 64. I didn't know you were on the night shift tonight. I'm filling in for my friend. Yes, her pilot came in, the one who flies charter planes abroad. You really do know everything. And your boyfriend? Named to the commission investigating the food poisoning down in Ni?. I saw you two together once. You were having a beer over near the hospital. We'd gone for my anemia checkup. It's not me waking you up, comrade. It's a call from Zagreb. This is a workplace. Please stop horsing around. When I say there's no hope, it's not just for show. I'll turn the lights out myself if I feel like it. Believe me, I hold you in the highest esteem. You're one of the most beautiful women in the whole building. I'd never stoop so low as to harm you. But you're so sexy, so it's not my fault if I wish to provide what your heart craves. A certain pleasure in life... and suchlike. Banja Luka? Hold on a moment. It's not right. Don't. No, I'm not talking to you. Please hold. God, you're persistent! When do you get off work? I only mean you well. - I work until 6:00. I wasn't talking to you. Hold on. Go away. If I start, I know I won't be able to stop. Stay on the line. I'm getting your number. This isn't right. Go away! Please hold. The line's busy. Is that you, Frosina? Give me 2274. Yes, Belgrade, here's Skopje for you. Please don't. Crikvenica doesn't answer. Yes. Banja Luka, I'm putting you through via Sibenik. The lines are down. The lines are down. DANCE THE RAPE OF THE SABINE WOMEN NIGHT What is it? You smell like cigarettes. What's come over you? You're so nervous. The enlarged right ovary displays a growth the size of a pea, differing in firmness from surrounding tissue and of a gray-yellow color. The uterine cavity holds a fetus three months old. The stork finally landed in your nest. Don't rub it in. Is this what it's all about? There's no problem. - There is! You'll bear me a little Turkish janissary. What do you want from me? What am I to you? Your servant? Your mistress? I didn't sign on to be your slave! Go away. Wanted. ; Bu?atlija, Ahmet, called "Meho." Occupation. ; sanitation inspector. Residence. ; Sremska 1. For the murder of Izabela Garodi, pursuant to Article 135, Section 2, of the Criminal Code. Yugoslavia, your people sing of your glory Our nation, filled with our love Be proud, Yugoslavia Meho! No! I won't let you. I won't let you do it! Stop! Meho! Come back! Be proud, Yugoslavia He used to live here. Came back dead drunk. Didn't sober up for ten days. We found him right there Sunday, wallowing in shit like a pig. Haven't seen him since. But before that he was a saint of a man, meek as a lamb. Suddenly something snapped, and he went crazy. My Commune, dethrone today Laziness and sloth, these old habits! Heart, renew yourself! Onward, O time! Wheels, gather momentum! Cogwheel of time Dayshift and nightshift turn without ceasing Make haste today! Onward, O time! Subtitles by Subtext Subtitling, Los Angeles
