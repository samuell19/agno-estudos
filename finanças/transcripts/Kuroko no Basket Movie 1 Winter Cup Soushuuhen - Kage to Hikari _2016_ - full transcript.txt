Yes! Nice pass, Tetsu! Kurochin and Minechin, you guys are so in sync that I'm sick of it. Kurokocchi, I want you to pass the ball to me! Tell that to the captain. After watching that play, we'll have to make it our standard course. Really, I wonder why. Tetsu and I don't agree on anything else. We only play basketball well together. Why is that? - Kuroko is a shadow. - Huh? The stronger the light, the darker the shadow. Meaning, the stronger the player he teams with, the stronger Kuroko's abilities are. It's not like we're not in tune with Kuroko. But, Aomine is the strongest. If he works best with Kuroko, then he must shine brighter than the rest of us. SEIRIN HIGH SCHOOL Are you into rugby? Have you ever played shogi? You gotta play baseball if you're Japanese! Swimming feels really good! BOY'S BASKETBALL It'd be nice to get more people. We didn't even get ten people. We're just getting started. We're a new school, if we win the Inter-High and Winter Cup, we'll be big news next year. Are you casually putting pressure on your captain? Hyuga, are you really that delicate? I'll do my best, I'll do my best... I wonder how recruitment is going? If they could bring some promising ones... I brought a new student... Huh? Is this the basketball club? TEA Yeah. What's with him? He's so intense, it's like a wild tiger is in front of me. - I want to join. - Huh? - The basketball club. - What? Oh, sure. Welcome, welcome! Wait a second. I think you know this, but we're a new school that formed last year. Since the older students are only second years, I'm sure someone with your build will quickly... I don't care. I'll write my name down and go back. Oh? You have no reason for joining? Not really. Anyways, basketball in Japan is the same anywhere. So scary. He's a first year? He's got some talent. You! Where were you hiding? Taiga Kagami. He went to middle school in America. Learned from the source. Either way, he's no normal player. - Hey. - Yes? This. You forgot to collect this application form. Oh, sorry. Let's see. Tetsuya Kuroko. Huh? CLASS 1-B STUDENT NO. 102153 TETSUYA KUROKO I've been at this table all this time but I don't remember him at all... TEIKO JUNIOR HIGH BASKETBALL TEAM He's from the Teiko basketball team! Teiko, you mean that Teiko? That's right. What's more, if he's a first year, he's a "Generation of Miracles." "Generation of Miracles"... You mean that famous group? Yeah. Man! Why didn't I remember the face of a golden egg like him? The guy from before just got back from the US. Aren't the first years this year crazy? He's better than I expected. Such destructive force or such unpolished, intuitive play. That's unbelievable... They're really good. There's no way we could've won. FIRST YEAR - 15 SECOND YEAR - 31 Huh? They're fighting about something. What's wrong? Did he play in the game? Kuroko? Well, I don't know. I also forgot, even though I'm the ref. Huh? Seriously, when did he start? Sorry. - Could you just pass it to me? - Huh? Yeah. What? How did that pass get through? Is he using his lack of presence to relay the pass? Misdirection. That's a technique used in magic. He guides the attention of opponents away from himself. In other words, he gets them to pay attention elsewhere. Damn it! He's the invisible Teiko Junior High regular who excelled at passing. The phantom sixth man of the Generation of Miracles! Just how strong is this "Generation of Miracles"? If I play them now, how would I do? You'd be killed instantly. Can't you word it another way? The five prodigies have gone on to play for their own good schools. There's no mistake, one of those schools will stand at the top. That's nice. I've decided. I'll defeat every player and become the best in Japan. I think that'll be impossible. Hey! I don't know if you have hidden talent, but at your current level you wouldn't even reach their feet. You can't do it alone. I've also decided. I am a shadow. But, the stronger the light, the darker the shadow and the more it accentuates the brightness of light. I'll be the shadow to your light and make you the best player in Japan. You said it. Have it your way. I'll do my best. GYMNASIUM INTER-HIGH PRELIMINARY TOURNAMENT CHAMPIONSHIP - You picked up! - Yeah? 02:15 TOO ACADEMY - 21 SEIRIN - 15 He's fast! You really are quick coming back! Well, it can't be helped. We'll start by, having our kamikaze captain pave the way for us. Sorry! Three points! His motion is so fast! It isn't just No. 9. It's the other four too. They weren't underestimating us. They're strong! Hey, what are you doing? Where are you now? What? I'm at school. Sorry. I overslept. Overslept? Our opponent is Tetsu's team! In the second half make sure to... Aomine. How long until you can get here? Imayoshi. Probably by the second half. We're counting on you! Our opponent is Seirin. There you go again. Twenty minutes is more than enough to defeat small fry like them. Well, I leave the first half to you. Hey! Player substitution, Too Academy! 09:56 TOO ACADEMY - 82 SEIRIN - 51 That guy is Daiki Aomine. Kuroko's middle school's strongest regular, the ace of the Generation of Miracles. Amazing! You haven't changed, Tetsu. He blocked it! All right, Kagami! Since middle school... Now! Fast break! You really haven't changed. I'll stop it this time! This unconventional tricky movement. I've seen it plenty of times in America. It's streetball! No you won't! - It's behind the basket! - They stopped it! You really haven't. I'm seriously disappointed. You haven't changed at all since the Junior High Nationals. Being the same means you haven't improved, right? I win, Tetsu. You can't win with your basketball. 0:00 SEIRIN - 55 TOO ACADEMY - 112 Hey. To be honest, I thought I could do more. But, look at us. In the face of overwhelming power, I don't think we can win just by working together. Take you off the starting lineup? Think about the guys on the bench! - But... - If I said I no, I mean no! But, if you really think you can't, at least tell Kagami. He believed in you. Kuroko has always helped me until now, so I want to distance myself for awhile. There's no way Kuroko will end like this. Until then, I want to become stronger, even by a little. - Kuroko. - Yeah? You don't have to pass to me anymore. Huh? Those weren't parting words, but words to make us stop relying on each other so we can become stronger. To combine our even greater powers and win. Imagine team strength like a multiplication. If each of the five players have low values, it won't become a large value. What Seirin needs now, is to improve each player's ability! In order for Seirin to win as a team. Starting today, gym practice will be rescheduled. We'll have joint practice with Shutoku High School! Has he ever done one-on-ones before? I don't know what you felt after losing to Aomine, but you've started to do ridiculous plays. They're not ridiculous. I just want to become stronger! Idiot! Don't say stupid things. I'll become stronger too. If you're too slow, I'll leave you behind. Get strong soon. Show me what you've got this winter! Kuroko's new basketball! TEIKO JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL The Teiko Junior High School basketball team. Even amidst its glorious history, there was a time when five prodigies were on the team simultaneously. The "Generation of Miracles." Ryota Kise. Shintaro Midorima. Daiki Aomine. Atsushi Murasakibara. Seijuro Akashi. And threatening them now is Seirin High School's shadow and light. KUROKO'S BASKETBALL WINTER CUP COMPILATION SHADOW AND LIGHT SENDAGAYA STATION There are three major tournaments in high school basketball. The summer Inter-High, the fall Nationals, and the Winter Cup. Until recently, the biggest title was in the summer. But the scale of the winter event has grown yearly. It's now on par with, if not greater, than the summer tournaments. The final greatest title. The Winter Cup. NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL SELECTION CHAMPIONSHIP The Winter Cup high school basketball tournament will now commence. Hey! What is that stupid Kagami doing? The opening ceremony is already over! Apparently, he forgot about the time difference... He says he'll be here soon. Unbelievable. Amazing. The Inter-High arena was amazing, but this is even bigger! And, no matter where you look are strong schools that I've seen in books and magazines. We're supposed to play these monsters? - Morons! - Ouch! It's not as if we're invited guests. Hold your heads high. Yes! Right? Isn't that right? You're scared too. Sorry. May I step out for a bit? What? I told you not to wander off so quickly. No, it's... I got a call. A call? I'm going to see Akashi. The Generation of Miracles' captain. I understand. We have a game this afternoon, so make sure to come back by then. Okay. - Furihata. - Huh? Wait, can you actually go with him? Okay. What's this, Tetsu? You've got a babysitter? Minechin, you've got Sacchin too. Satsuki has nothing to do with this. By the way, Midorimacchi, why did you bring a pair of scissors? It's obviously my lucky charm, you idiot. It's dangerous though. I wish you wouldn't walk around with them out like that. Thanks for waiting. No way. Is this a gathering of all of the Generation of Miracles? Seriously. Wow! This is scary! I wanna go home! Besides, why is the guy who called us out the last to arrive? No need to nit pick. He's that kind of guy. Sheesh. Sorry to make you guys wait. That's the captain of the Generation of Miracles? Daiki, Ryota, Shintaro, Atsushi. And Tetsuya. I'm glad to see you again. I'm deeply moved we were all able to meet like this. However, there is someone here who doesn't belong. I wish to speak only to my former teammates right now. I'm sorry, but will you leave? I totally want to do that, but... What is this? My legs won't move! Furihata. What? You're no fun. Don't exclude us. - Kagami! - I'm back. We'll talk later. For now... Are you Akashi? Pleased to meet you. Shintaro. Could I borrow those scissors for a moment? Huh? What will you use them for? My hair is annoying me. I wanted to trim it a bit. Well, before that... It's Kagami, right? What? Kagami! No way! He was serious. What was he thinking? If Kagami hadn't dodged that... Oh. You dodged that well. In light of that display of grace, I'll forgive you this time. But not next time. If I tell you to leave, leave. Victory is everything in this world. Winners have everything affirmed. Losers have everything denied. In everything I've ever done, I've never lost, and I never will. Because I always win, I am always right. I don't forgive those who go against me, not even my own parents. Well, I'll be going then. Today was just to say hello. What? Don't mess with us, Akashi! You called us just for that? No... I wanted to confirm something, But after seeing your faces, there's no need. None of you seem to have forgotten our promise. Then, we're fine. We'll meet on court next time. Oh! Here they come! Good luck, Seirin! Amazing! The cheering is completely different here! The seats are almost full even though it's the first day. Could it be that we're popular? Morons. Of course not. Huh? "Good luck" probably doesn't mean what you think it does. - Huh? - Unfortunately, Most of the fans are here for the opposing team. Here they are! How many points will they get today? The rising tyrants. Too Academy! And the genius scorer of the Generation of Miracles. Daiki Aomine! There isn't a single person who can beat him one-on-one. No one can read what play Imayoshi will do next. I've also never seen a center run like Wakamatsu. Amazing. As expected of a Inter-High runner-up school. Don't lose your head. We knew this... right... It's time. Both schools, please line up. All right. Let's go! This is everyone's first national tournament, but they're all focused. Sheesh. They're especially reliable today. - Let's have a good game. - Let's make it good. - Hey. - Huh? This time, we definitely won't lose! That's fine. The game between Seirin High and Too Academy will now begin! Thank you very much! DAIKI AOMINE RYO SAKURAI YOSHINORI SUSA KOSUKE WAKAMATSU SHOICHI IMAYOSHI TETSUYA KUROKO TAIGA KAGAMI SHUN IZUKI JUNPEI HYUGA TEPPEI KIYOSHI The beginning is important! Our opponent is the Inter-High runner-up. What's more, they beat us last time with double our score. The power difference is obvious. For that reason, don't hold back if they underestimate you. Start full throttle and take the lead! This is... They're not underestimating us. They're playing like it's a final game! Damn it! No you don't! It's not a shot? This is... An alley-oop! You're finally here? You took your time. They got us. But... It's not unexpected. If they're going all out, then as we planned, we'll go with Kuroko's improved Ignite Pass, Assault No. 2! - Huh? - Hey! Kuroko's pass shouldn't work against Aomine. What are you planning? That form is... The Ignite Pass? No, this is a little different. Ignite Pass... Kai! All right! Go, Kiyoshi! Not so fast! A pass? He was definitely going for a dunk at first. All right, an alley-oop! Seriously, that was amazing! What was that pass earlier? I see. Seems like I can have a little more fun with you now Tetsu. I'd be offended, if you thought I'm the same as before. I need to watch for his three-pointers. But he's not that fast. I need to keep close... Is that alright? To be so far away. Huh? Far? What? Just now... A step back jump shot? But it was too fast! The first years aren't the only ones who improved. Apologetic mushroom. The inviolable shot. Barrier Jumper! They picked up another troublsome technique. Are you okay, Sakurai? You need help? No, I'm okay. I'll do it myself. Wow! Amazing defense! Pass to me, Sakurai! He forced the shot! - I will win. - Huh? I mean, I'm the better one! What? I will win. I'm the better one. I won't lose... Izuki. - Yeah? - Keep passing to me. That's fine, but you're pretty fired up. Yeah. He's just annoying! He needs to quit pouting! - No misses! - Neither team is giving an inch! Five seconds left! 0:05 SEIRIN - 19 TOO ACADEMY - 22 The first quarter will finish with Too in the lead. No, not yet! Vanishing Drive! Bastard! They're tied! Amazing, Seirin! They caught up with a buzzer beater! I've never seen that! Susa. How was it? Yeah. It's as Momoi said. Conditions? Conditions, or rather... Kuroko can't do that drive by himself. Not by himself? So you figured it out, Takao? Well, Shin and I have fallen for it a lot. Shut up, Takao. The Vanishing Drive, can only be used when Kagami is in the field of vision of the opponent you're trying to pass. The ball usually has the most presence on court. So while he's holding the ball, Tetsu can't misdirect his opponent's vision. But, with the improved Kagami, Tetsu can misdirect their attention to him for a moment. That's the secret behind the Vanishing Drive. In other words, we should separate Kagami and Kuroko. Then that's easy. If Aomine checks Kagami... I don't wanna. Huh? Stop messing around! Every time! Every time! I could say the same about you. "Don't let them do it", "Keep Kagami away." Why do I have to be the team's errand boy? If they want to do it, let them. They'll never get past me. Even if hell freezes over. The only one who can beat me, is me! Aomine and the little guy are going one-on-one? No way! I'm glad you get it quick, Tetsu. We get along when it comes to basketball. I think so too! Go! No way! What the hell... His eyes! If he doesn't see Kagami, his reaction won't be delayed. But... No way. Did he move in response to Kuroko's breath and rhythm? Too bad, Tetsu! Don't get the wrong idea, Tetsu. Shadow exists because of the light, but the opposite isn't true, no matter how much you struggle. Shadow can't beat the light. This is bad! Kuroko! Time out! - Huh? - Kuroko! No way. What is he thinking? Stop, Kuroko! Neither Hyuga or Kiyoshi are off of their marks! Idiot. Did you think the same technique would work on me twice? Don't let me down too much, Tetsu. If this is your answer to beating me, let me make it clear. It's wasted effort. You're not getting through! Seirin High, time out. I'm subbing you out for now, Kuroko. Okay... Listen, everyone. I noticed something watching the flow of this game. First... Shadow exists because of the light. Damn it... If this is your answer to beating me, let me make it clear. It's wasted effort. Damn it... It's not a waste, idiot. Everyone believes in you. You'll definitely come back. Until that time, I'll teach him. There's no such thing as wasted effort. Over here! Shit! - All right! - Nice shot! Was I imagining things? I thought you looked ready when you stepped on the court. Shut up! It just so happened that Kiyoshi got a good look. Don't worry. I don't plan on running away. Not at all. Change of pace. Here it comes. I've been saved by that shrimp so many times. Beating Aomine doesn't matter anymore. This time I will help him. What? Was something unleashed with Kuroko's complete defeat? By changing from saved to savior, the power he's unconsciously suppressed until now is being released. Is this Kagami's real power? Hey, that was good. I'm finally getting excited a bit. Honestly, I didn't expect much of you, but you've improved. This time, I might be able to play a little harder. Do your best to entertain me, Kagami! This is... An alley-oop to Wakamatsu! All right! I'll take care of it! You jumped the gun. Of course it's not! What was that? A shot behind his back? Without looking at the basket... He also stole the ball from a teammate! Damn you, Aomine! That was misleading! Just don't interfere. If I have the ball, give me some room. What? It's been a while since I've had a real opponent. Don't get in my way! That Kagami, he's on the same level as Aomine! Kagami. Did I do something I shouldn't have? Huh? No, not at all. I don't think your presence changed the outcome though. What? Sorry. Could you leave Aomine up to me? A little more. I think I'm almost there. There it is again! The Formless Shot! Kagami! What? He blocked Aominecchi's full power shot? 9:46 SEIRIN - 46 TOO ACADEMY - 48 It is now halftime. The third quarter will start in 10 minutes. Hey, Aomine! Where are you going? Shut up. I'll come back for the second half. Huh? Wakamatsu, let him go. Sheesh. He'd better be all right. Well, don't worry about him. Aomine was really playing seriously back there. But, he wasn't showing everything he has. You'll get it once the second half starts. In the end, there's no one who can beat him. - Also, it's probably the reverse. - Huh? You're right. He finally found an opponent he can unleash his all against. I think Aomine right now, is beside himself with joy. TEIKO - 130 KAWAKI - 61 Amazing. Aomine scored 80 points all by himself. With Aomine around, it's not even a contest. He's not a prodigy, he's a monster. - Aomine. - Huh? Tetsu, don't you have practice? Wanna walk home together? Alright, let's go. Aomine, you've been missing practice recently. Yeah, it's fine. If I practice, I'll get better. What? The harder I work, the more boring basketball becomes. And I don't think, I'll ever get what I want... Basketball, in the end, is just a game. From now on, I'll start skipping games too. You can't. A Popsicle? I'm always barely keeping up with you guys. Honestly, I don't understand your feelings. But, no matter how much stronger you are if I were your opponent, I wouldn't want you to hold back or go easy on me. Besides, I'm sure someone better than you will appear soon enough. Is that so? That's right. All right! Just play by yourself. What is this? It's like they're saying "We're done fighting." KAMIZAKI - 81 TEIKO - 150 This is what happens when I play a little harder? If the opponent loses their motivation, where's the fun in basketball then? Tetsu. - It's no good after all. - Huh? The only one who can beat me, is me. Your body will get cold, idiot. Kagami. If you don't hurry back, the second half will start. Sorry. I'll go soon. Hey. What were you thinking just now? Huh? Do you like basketball, Kagami? What? I wasn't thinking of anything particularly complicated. I just, I just want to see Aomine playing with a smile again. If we can win this game, perhaps... How should I know? People aren't that simple. Even if we win, we don't know if he'll change. But if we lose, it's definite nothing will change. All we can do is to play as hard as we can to win. Okay. He's gonna play? I'm impressed he's back on the court after being destroyed by Aomine But what can he do? 10:00 SEIRIN - 46 TOO ACADEMY - 48 This guy... Impossible! I won't make it in time! Charging! Black Team, No. 5! Even if he'd gone to help after Aomine passed him, it would've been too late. Could it be that he predicted his course? If you can predict my moves, isn't the opposite true as well? The time spent is the same. We get along when it comes to basketball, Aomine. You've done it now, Tetsu. All right! Let's go! Damn it! It's Kuroko! He's doing nothing on offense? He is? Ow! All right! He made the three-pointer! All right, Captain! - Kuroko! - Nice shot. That pass still really hurts! Sorry. They're suddenly on a roll! 9:25 SEIRIN - 49 TOO ACADEMY - 48 It's been going mostly according to plan so far. It's a shame since he just came in, but we need him kept under control. No way! Imayoshi is marking Kuroko! Face guard No. 11? If I could, I'd already be doing that. Even if I'm careful, he's gone before I know it. That "before you know it" is the point. Huh? It's not as if he disappears for an entire game. Usually he's just hard to notice with his unusually weak presence. And so, make certain not to lose sight of him. But that type of gaze is most easily misdirected. Trying harder to see him is exactly what he wants. It makes you more vulnerable to misdirection. Then, how do you mark him? Hey, hey. She's pretty much told you already. Just don't try seeing him. Right? He uses misdirection when working with his teammates. For that reason, he makes eye contact with the cooperating player right before. The player he makes eye contact with is a mirror that reflects him. He will be at the end of the player's line of sight. To keep marking Kuroko without losing sight of him, we should look at the mirror. The most threatening thing is not his pass or drive, but misdirection that supports all his techniques. When that becomes useless, he becomes powerless. Don't be hard on me. Let's be friends. It's my first time seeing this. Kuroko's passes have been stopped before, but even so, we've made it through with passes and drives. But, this time is different. His misdirection isn't working. But it should be impossible for a normal player to detect Kuroko's gaze when he's undetectable. But he can do it. He reads the opponent's thoughts from their expressions and actions. He's like a monster when it comes to figuring out a person's intentions. He's practically psychic. When it comes to doing things people hate, no one can beat him. A three-pointer! 8:53 SEIRIN - 49 TOO ACADEMY 50 Hyuga! I'll return the favor! Take this! - The Barrier Jump! - Did he predict it? That quick step back into a jump shot... The trick is to find the center of gravity. Don't be fooled by his upper body. When he has the ball, look at the toes of his pivoting foot. Too also has this. A defense that combines Momoi's predictions and data. Shit! Their offense is strong enough as it is... Hey, hey. You're having fun without me. Are you ready for our round two, Kagami? This guy... Hey! You're not going anywhere. As long as I'm on you, you should give up going to help him. Kuroko and the upperclassmen have been shut down... We'll lose at this rate. I've gotta do this! You're not concentrating enough! Damn it! Wait, you! Hyuga! Shit! No, but he cut around in that moment! I won't let you through! What? Amazing... 6:59 SEIRIN - 51 TOO ACADEMY - 59 The lead has widened. 2:51 SEIRIN - 56 TOO ACADEMY - 70 The third quarter is almost over. They were doing so well too. What are you saying? The game is still... No, there's no chance of comeback. You guys, too? Do you mean that it's impossible to close the score gap now? That's not it. Look. Kurokocchi's mark is... No way. They can see him? The more he uses misdirection, the less effective it becomes. It can't last for a full 40 minutes. That misdirection has run out completely. Seirin no longer has cards to play. They've played their last card. It is Seirin's loss. But, it's nothing to be ashamed of. Actually, it's quite a feat. You made it to the Winter Cup with a team of only first and second years. You'll go even further in another year. Try again next year. We can't wait that long. Huh? Next time isn't good enough. Not next time. We'll win now! They haven't given up. None of them. And... Their fighting spirit hasn't waned, instead it's stronger than ever! But there's nothing left Seirin can do. Your misdirection trump card has expired. Fighting spirit alone won't change anything. That's not quite right. What? It hasn't expired. We made it expire. Huh? He disappeared! What? What the hell happened just now? Imayoshi couldn't move a muscle. Could it be Izuki's new technique? But that's not possible, because that was... Ridiculous. That's impossible! Players other than Kuroko can disappear? Damn it! That was a careless pass... Disappeared... You're kidding me! Hyuga too? 2:04 SEIRIN - 60 TOO ACADEMY - 70 All right! Back-to-back points! Ten point difference! Captain! What's happening? Kuroko's misdirection ran out. I can see him clearly. So why? I can see him? Utilizing Kagami's overwhelming presence on the court, the opponent's attention is misdirected. That's the principle of the Vanishing Drive. So now Kuroko has taken the place of Kagami? When Kuroko perfected his Vanishing Drive against Shutoku, he realized the potential of the technique. Misdirecting his opponent's line of sight not from himself, but away from his teammates. He grants his teammates the effect of the Vanishing Drive. That is Misdirection Overflow. However... However, there are probably some risks with that technique. Risks? 01:23 SEIRIN - 60 TOO ACADEMY 70 The first is time. It can only be used at the end of the game. Kuroko himself shouldn't be able to misdirect for that long. Second, Seirin is throwing away a future. What Kuroko is doing is like performing a trick while showing how it's done. In other words, when this game is over, he won't be able to use misdirection against Too again. Both teams are from the Tokyo area. They're sure to face each other again in the future. But, no matter how much Kagami and the other players grow, it won't be that easy to win against Too without that trump card. In other words, to play this high stakes game, they threw away their possibility to win against Too in the future? Seriously? Nevertheless... It's better than losing here. He still has this much power? We'll worry about the future when we get there. Tetsu... 10:00 SEIRIN - 62 TOO ACADEMY - 73 All right, win or lose, these are the last 10 minutes. Let's win! Okay! Aomine? Aomine! Hey, Aomine! Huh? What? Don't give me that. We're starting. Everyone went. Were you listening to the instructions? Sorry. I wasn't listening. Huh? 10:00 SEIRIN - 62 TOO - 73 Since when did I start to leave the house yawning on game days? Since when did I stop feeling anything even when we won? All I wanted was an opponent I could play all out against. It's what I'd always wanted. A game so close I don't know if I'll win or lose. Thank you, Tetsu. No way... That's impossible. The Zone. Is he in it? "Zone." All unnecessary thoughts and emotions disappear in this state of extreme focus, and become absorbed in the game. Only those who have practiced and practiced, earn the right to stand in front of its door. Even so, this door opens only on a whim. It is the ultimate domain where only the chosen can enter. But, Aomine's senses pried the door open as if to make a mockery of it. It's the first time we're seeing this. This is... Aomine's true form! Wow! What a quick reaction! You're joking. He's a monster! Normally it's impossible to play at 100% of your ability in a game. But the Zone makes the impossible 100% possible. Moreover, if it's Aomine's 100%, it will feel like he's twice as fast as he was before. That's crazy. Those two could hardly even react. 4:11 SEIRIN - 85 TOO ACADEMY - 92 Captain, I have a favor to ask. Yes? Let me take on Aomine one-on-one. Please. Huh? I have no intention to beat the Generation of Miracles alone now. If it was for the team's victory, I'd happily go be benched. But I have to take him on alone! Understood. You get two minutes. You're the ace, do what you like. Captain... In the meantime, we'll wear them down all we can! It's up to you, Kagami! - An Aomine and Kagami... - One-on-one? They're leaving it up to their ace now? But I don't think they're that crazy. You gonna go up against me? But it's impossible for you. Your light... is too faint. He got it! More. Even more! We won't lose. Let's take it back! Misdirection Overflow! Is our timing off? No. The Overflow effect is starting to expire! Damn! If the ball goes out now... Not yet! What? Kuroko! Hyuga! I can't let you pull away now. The ace who carries our thoughts will never lose. I believe in Kagami. Defense! Defense! Defense! Defense! Defense! Shit! 3:13-3:12 2:05 SEIRIN - 93 TOO ACADEMY - 98 Shit. Why? Why am I so weak? We have to win! I don't want to lose anymore. I don't want to end here! I'm sick of it! Of... Seeing my friends cry! If I can't do it here, when will I do it? What? Impossible! He reacted to Aomine, who's in the Zone? Is that even... Could it be, Kagami's there too? I take back what I said before, Kagami. You're the best! Is this what happens when players who enter the zone clash? Out of bounds! Black ball! What a battle. Those two are in a completely different dimension. No one has scored for close to a minute. What will happen here? Aomine... He looks like he's having fun. Aomine and Kagami. The sparks scattered by the two aces captivated everyone in the arena, and it seemed it would continue endlessly. And everyone wanted it to. However, the finish was sudden... He blew past him! Wow! Kagami! It's a three point difference! 0:41,5 SEIRIN - 95 TOO ACADEMY - 98 That's crazy. Kagami is faster? How'd that happen? He can't get by? No. Kagami isn't faster. It must be the Zone's time limit! But, why just Aomine? The ace who carries our thoughts will never lose. I believe in Kagami. You're kidding me! That makes me... Aomine. You are strong! If it was one-on-one I'd seriously never win. I've already passed my time limit too. But I can still fight because I have support! It's more than the power of one person. For all of the guys, I'll definitely win! 0:29,0 SEIRIN - 97 TOO ACADEMY - 98 All right! - One point difference. - But we have 30 seconds left... Are you okay, Aomine? Don't touch me. I just stumbled a little. Don't get in my way. We're getting to the good part. It's about to get hyped! Come on! Stop the ball even if it kills us! Amazing... It's a good defense. Defense! Defense! Defense! Defense! Still, Aomine is the strongest. He's cornered! Damn it! No way... Shit! That monster! He made the shot! Too's killing blow! 00:15,2 SEIRIN - 97 TOO ACADEMY - 100 The three point difference is too much! This is bad! The time is almost... Seirin no longer has any strength left to play in overtime. They can't tie with a three-pointer. They really need two more shots. If they finish like this, nothing will have changed. I don't want to see that! Win, Seirin! Never give up! Captain! Kagami! Make the shot, Kagami! Crap. This dunk will be stopped! What should I do? Shit! Kagami! A pass? Go! You won't get through! They're stronger. But to create an opening for a comeback... A fake? No way you... Pushing, defense! Black No. 6! The basket counts. One free throw! All right! All right! I can't believe he'd pass with that timing. Not bad. Five seconds left... 0:05,2 SEIRIN - 99 TOO ACADEMY - 100 If he makes it, they're tied. Overtime... But then they'll be heading toward their demise. For Seirin to win, they have to get an upset here. To do that... We know what they'll do. There's only one course of action for them. They'll miss this free throw. No, they'll miss it for sure. We'll steal the ball and score. That's the only way we can win. We've already given our all and are at our limits. They still have stamina and extra players on bench. If we go into overtime, we'll definitely lose. But, if the shooter is Kiyoshi, Kagami and I will be rebounding. Of course I'll go for the ball with all I have. But if anyone has a chance, it's you Kagami. Let's go. This is the last play. A rebound battle! One shot! What? He's wide open! He can just go for the basket! It's our win! Hey, wait! Why... Why are you over there? Kuroko! Even though I'm on Aomine's team, I thought for a moment Kagami had the ball. I was a few seconds late to move after Aomine knocked the ball. I can't believe he moved faster than me! It's impossible! Did you believe in Aomine, instead of Kagami? No, that's not quite right. I believed in both of them. But there's only one person who I believe will make the last shot! Kagami! Go! Kagami! Besides, I'm sure someone better than you will appear soon. Time's up! 0:00,0 SEIRIN - 101 TOO ACADEMY - 100 We did it! I... lost? I see... I lost... I... Line up! Kuroko! Are you okay? Sheesh. You can barely stand even with someone supporting you. Who could tell you won like this? But, maybe it was for the best. After all, the cause of defeat was that difference. Why are you looking like it's all over? Huh? It's only just begun. Let's play again. I'll take you on! Get out of here, idiot. Aomine? Huh? You can't win with your basketball. You win, Tetsu. - Can I ask you for a favor? - Huh? You didn't return my fist bump back then. What? Who cares about that? I do. Put your shoes in the one who was ignored. Fine. But, just this once. I'll win next time. Okay. Seirin High wins, 101-100. Bow! Thank you very much!
