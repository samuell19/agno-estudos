Doesn't make up for the fact that you've been lying in this family for who knows how long... - You're right. I am a liar to you, your mother, my friends and, worst of all, myself. The truth is I can't even tell you how long it's been since I've felt this way I guess because of the times in which I was raised it was a feeling I always suppressed and that doesn't mean I never loved your mother - If you loved her then you would tell her the truth - I want to but right now I'm too afraid of hurting her. - Holding now is it gonna make this any better ? When she'll find out the truth on her own she's gonna hate you even more Trust me, I know - You're right I'll tell her when I feel the time is right - You know what dad ? You are right I feel the time it's right now - Chris, wait - Wait for what? For you to keep holding out ? Look, I'm not gonna live my life like you being afraid of who I am and who I wanto to be Chris listen I'm so proud of you for feeling what you're feeling and being the person that you want to be I have had to live my life everyday knowing that I'm living a lie and that kills me inside but with all that pain comes to joy knowing that I have you and your mom in my life I never want to lose you so I made the choice to live that lie You have to understand the repercussions of telling the truth the way you want to. Just let me take care of it with your mother I'll tell her when the time is ripe I promise I love you son - I love you dad - Chris I'm sure you'll tell Gillian when the time is right - When the time is right - Everything's okay ? - Yeah, yeah yeah things are fine There is only this I want to tell you - I' m sorry. - You go first - No you go first. Yours is probably more important - Yeahh! Gillian why don't you go first ? Chris I'm pregnant - You ? What ? - You're gonna be a father - We're gonna be grand-parents - So babe what did you want to tell me ?
