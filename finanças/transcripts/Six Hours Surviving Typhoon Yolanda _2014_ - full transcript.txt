(somber music) - Things are flying everywhere. It sounded like howling dogs. - [Lea] There's not even time to cry. - We hang on for our dear lives. - Either they're dead or they're looking for their dead. They too thought thought that they would die. - [Aaron] World just came crashing down. (gentle music) - I'm Jiggy Manicad, I'm a senior news producer and the anchor for GMA Network, and I've been covering disasters and tragedies in the Philippines and outside the country as well. - [All] Good afternoon, sir. - We only go to places for breaking news only. - [Jiggy] We were already in Tacloban to do coverage of the preparations of the typhoon. - When we heard about the gravity of the typhoon the government officials, everybody was saying that it was strong, really really strong, but we didn't really mind it. We were used to typhoons and storms so it didn't really matter. - Our country's visited by calamities most of the time. - In the Philippines you always get hit by a bunch of tropical storms. I mean, every time I've been there it's rained. - The situation was just normal and the weather was just fine. - It's normal, sunny. - There wasn't any strong winds at that time so I wasn't expecting that much about Yolanda itself. - We weren't expecting anything. - [Jiggy] Though very few of us seemed to take it seriously, Yolanda was already classified as a category five typhoon even before it made landfall in the Philippines. (suspenseful music) (melancholy music) - On November 7th, a day before, my parents were kind of afraid. So I looked for a hotel and then I checked them in Tacloban. It was near Astrodome along Cancabato Bay at budget hotel. The weather was okay, there was no wind, it was sunny. I left the hotel and I said Mum, Dad, I'll just fetch you tomorrow. It was like a normal day, we were playing, watching TV, eating, we had food. I said okay, I have to go. The storm might come 'round eight so I think I'll just go and fetch you tomorrow. So I arrived here, I fetched my girlfriend, she was with me. We ate, then watched TV, watched a movie, then, I mean, we felt that nothing was gonna happen. We slept. - It's the usual news coverage now. We will get up at 11 a.m. and then call time is around 2 p.m. The ordinary day to day news coverage. It will be a super typhoon. We finished at six p.m. and then we arrived in our hotel at seven p.m. We had dinner and then that's it, we rested. - Then around three a.m. (wind howling) - I was awakened by the strong winds at around three a.m. - The wind was getting stronger. Then we were looking around, looking out our window, and then we saw some of the houses, especially our neighbor here in front, the house already had fell. The storm hasn't started but most of the houses were already falling apart, so actually we were laughing. Ah, look at that house, it fell down. - I was still on the radio. I was live on radio and I was appealing to the people to get out of the shorelines, get out of the coastal areas. - I alerted my team to start filming, and also to record the sound of the winds. - We were actually afraid, it was so strong. - It's really different, it's howling. - It sounded like howling dogs. It was like how hell hounds sound like. - While the storm was pounding on Tacloban city, my air-conditioning unit was pushed inwards. (crashing) The ceiling on my room started to beat as if it was like a heart. (thudding) The wall in my room cracked. Things are flying everywhere, be it pieces of wood, even trees. - I just stared at the street. And then all of a sudden it's gone. - And the wind direction is changing from time to time so it was a very dangerous situation. The only protection we had was the roof and from time to time we would go inside our bathroom. If my ceiling would collapse or be sucked out, that would be it. Around 6:30 in the morning I was able to do a live report for the radio, the local radio, and a program for GMA Network, and by around 7:30 communications went down. (muffled speaking) - [Radio Presenter] Jiggy? Hello, Jiggy? (somber music) - After electricity was cut, everything was cut, just dark. Dark but eerie white glow. The floor was rumbling, the wall was rumbling, everything was flying. Little by little my house, our house was being torn apart by the storm. We looked around. The house was totally destroyed. But the first thing on my mind was how were my parents? - We almost died, together with my wife and three children. The storm surge for the first time, the water from the sea, the water for the bay, they met together, it was like this high already. We were fortunate that we had a window that we weren't escape through the window. We hang on for our dear lives. But fortunately the sea and the water subsided immediately. If not for the window, the back of a room, I think all of us would have perished. (muffled yelling) - Myself, my family, people started getting worried. You know, started calling home to call my grandmother, my uncle, other family and friends out there and the phone lines are shut down. (tense music) - Not a single roof was in place. All the trees were either broken, fallen, or no leaves at all. Everything was in a total destruction. Thick glass, I mean that thick. - We had to send a message, at least, that we were alive. Not even the story, just the message that we were okay. (brooding music) We lost the internet, we lost the mobile phone lines so I told my team that the only thing that would tell our relatives, our boss that we're okay, we're alive, to be able to deliver the news, is to go to Palo, Leyte, which is about six hours away by walk. By walk because most of the lampposts, the trees have fallen on the roadside. Even motorcycles can't pass through. Our satellite is on another town. It's around 15 miles away, so we had to walk for about six hours just to get to that satellite setup. That is the only chance that some of our story will be able to come out. Not to beat a deadline but to really send a message across not only the Philippines but worldwide. I did not expect that our communications team, our satellite team, is still intact during that time because I didn't have an idea. I just have this theory that if we can go to Palo and the satellite team is okay, we might have a chance to communicate whatever message that we have right now. - Of course we don't have communication. That's the shortest place that we can go. - I did not expect that even the basic mobility that we have where the roads that we needed would be blocked by all the debris, fallen trees, fallen lampposts, just to be able to be mobile during that. I did not expect that actually. I expected a lot of damages on the roofs or in the structures but not the roads that we badly needed during that time. So of course when I saw then that we cannot even pass through and we cannot even drive our service vehicle going down the road, I mean, I felt that this is going to be another problem for us. It's going to be another challenge for us. Problems piling up on each other. You have a problem with communication, you don't have communication, you don't have food, water, now you don't have the basic mobility that you need during that time, so what you have is just yourself, your clothing and the camera that we have during that time. When I broached them the idea of walking, going to Palo despite what we are seeing right now, we were all convinced that it was the best thing that we can do. - We were shocked, we were in a state of shock. (indistinct chattering) I think there's no time for us, not even time to cry, because people started coming in. People who were wounded, there were even those carrying their dead, and we have to do something about them so there was nothing we can do but just attend to the people who came who were in need of help. I converted the two big rooms there as a mini hospital. We called for volunteers and a lot came, but we had no doctors and then we had medicine because we always had in our unit, in our HQ, so we were able to treat a lot of people. - At least about 100 meters away from our hotel room which is still part of the property of the owners of that hotel, we immediately saw 12 dead bodies on the shoreline. Children, women, men, and a lot of dead animals also. A few persons we saw were volunteers from the Philippine Red Cross which were doing the best that they can to retrieve the bodies from the shoreline. They had to use whatever they can just to retrieve these bodies. Doors of refrigerators, manually, taking them without even gloves. They themselves have become victims of this typhoon. - We tried to go to Tacloban. It's a good thing my car started so we went to Tacloban but didn't really reach Tacloban because it was already flooded. We were really hopeful when we were going to Tacloban, we said hey, let's go to the hotel, maybe Mom is there, Dad, they still have food, let's charge, I wanna take 'em back. But when we arrived there it was even worse. People were walking and crying, there were already dead people lined up in the streets so I was really afraid. The worst thing was when I saw my friends. I saw some of my friends along the street. Hey, how are you, how are you? And I said how was Astrodome? I did not say budget hotel, for I didn't want to hear the answers. I just wanted to ask what happened. The Astrodome, they said everybody's dead. - 200 meters away from the hotel we can't find the road, the small road towards the city, because it's submerged in waist-deep floods during that time. Of course we were worried during that time of other diseases other than leptospirosis, perhaps cholera or diarrhea, 'cause we can see septic tanks open or restrooms blown away. - I was having my period at that time, so I crossed this flooded street. So I saw young flood water and then - We had to climb a fallen tree just to be able to go to that road. Immediately when we were able to cross that fallen tree in that flooded area, saw a lot of dead bodies in the street. Just covered with tarpaulins or plastics, whatever the people can see or use to cover them. - I saw a lot of dead people lined up on the streets. One by one I looked at them. Then when I saw this body wearing the pants of my mother I said no no, that's not her. Maybe people just stole her clothes and wore it. Then I saw her blouse. Oh no, I was no, that's not her, somebody stole her blouse. I saw her earrings. No, that's not her, maybe they stole her whole wardrobe. I approached that body, I slowly remove the cover. They just put a tire in front of her, a rubber, nothing. When I removed it, I saw my mom, and... Sorry. - [Interviewer] Your dad, when did you see him? - Wait. Sorry. I saw my mom and you know, my world just came crashing down and... I was really crying. And then my girlfriend saw me, she was also crying and I... I tried to resuscitate her, you know? She was cold, I held her hand. Said mom, mom. You know, her eyes were open, they were lifeless. I fixed her hair. Then I closed her eyes. People were around, I was really crying so hard and then people were around. They were, what happened, what happened? My mom, where's my dad, where's my dad? I didn't know if they understood me. They said there are a lot of people. I told them let me see, I want to see if my dad is there. So I went around looking at all the debris. They kept pointing me, is that your dad? I said no, is that your dad? No, they kept pointing at dead bodies. - Lot of people were asking if they could have their messages recorded on our microphone and our camera just to be able to tell their relatives that they are alive, but what I've noticed is that all of them, all of them looked exhausted, they looked hungry, thirsty, and somehow it was good that they were alive but you can see the suffering that they have encountered and they will encounter the next few days. The very first interview that we did, or not exactly an interview but a chance interview that we did was of a man carrying a girl. I thought that the girl was just sleeping so when I approached the man and asked him what happened, how are they, he told me that that's his daughter and she's dead. He said that they were trapped inside an evacuation center because when the floodwaters came in the kids were not able to get out because all the rooms had steel bars on the windows so the kids were trapped inside. - I felt helpless when people asked me for help and I couldn't do anything, I couldn't even give them what they needed during that time. - There are people staying at the second floor of a building shouting at us: - It was more of assuring them that we will try to communicate their message across for help to come in. - They were all asking for help. Please help us, please tell our families that we're okay, and that was the only thing I can do, just to record their messages, their plea for help, and assure them that we'll do whatever we can to ask for help. While we were seeking stories, these places, I think it was more of the story sought us. - I shouted how many of you are survivors? Are you all left? How many are survivors? It's only us, it was like eight people. And I said oh my God. Then I thought that the receptionist, I saw her, I said what happened, what happened? Sir, sorry, we didn't know what to do. We couldn't help you so where's my dad? I don't know, we don't know. So I said ah but he might have survived, he might have escaped. Okay, so what happened, it's alright. It's not your fault, or them. I told her it's not your fault what happened. They said around seven... They said around seven a.m., floodwaters, there was flood, ankle-deep waters, and after a few seconds it subsided. After it subsided, a few seconds after, there was like 20 feet of waters. 20-foot wave after a few seconds. Okay, so I said to them let me look at their room, maybe we still have things there. When I entered their room there was no door anyway. There's no door, there's no windows. Looked at the room, I looked there, and I looked down on the floor, I saw my dad. I saw my dad and our helper on the floor, and again, I just broke down. I held my dad, tried to resuscitate him again but blood was pouring out of his mouth and our maid was there and I just lied back and cried. - Because of the distance they had blisters on their feet, and one of the journalists that went with me had his feet bloody because of the long hours of walking. During that time even my camera crew was so tired, I think they wanted to just sit on the roadside and wait for us to come back. In coverages like this as much as I can I try to stay positive, to think positively, but of course in between I say my prayers and what I did during that time was to wear my wedding ring, just in case, I mean, just in case something happens, the roof collapses or the ceiling collapses on us I might be identified somehow with my wedding ring. Entertaining the thoughts of dying or delving on it, I do not do that much. But of course I just, you know, I just thought of if something happens they'll be able to retrieve me or identify me after a few days or a few weeks. (gentle choral music) (brooding music) We went to the satellite setup. - Nobody was there, no GMA staff, no technical people. So we circled the area. Still no GMA person there, so I decided option B, we'll go back to the hotel, we'll walk again for six hours. My God, I don't wanna walk again for six hours. Then I asked Jiggy so what will we do? so doing our setup and then we had a chance to go live. - Only to find out that the team there was also traumatized. They evacuated in a cathedral to be met by strong winds and the roof of that church, piece by piece, collapsed. (shouting indistinctly) I only had about a few minutes for the newscast to end. I tried to motivate the technical team head and tell him that we need to have a setup here because this is the only means to communicate with the office. They communicating to our relatives that we're all alive. (dramatic music) They gathered some sort of an industrial blower to dry up the equipment. We didn't have phone lines at time. What we did was stepping on a signal. We just waved at the camera in the studio, hey, we're alive. They put the portion on air. - Crossed my fingers, I know they were watching. - Before the newscast ended we were able to do a live report. We were able to show the initial pictures of the devastation. The dead, the properties being washed out, being washed away. Those unimaginable things that we saw on the road to Palo. (muffled speaking) The images we captured during those six hours we were cut off from the world can now be seen by all. The people are now aware of what happened to us, and what happened to Tacloban. (engine roaring) The first thing that we wanted to do was to get the vital equipment there. They were incommunicado for the last six hours, and that's unusual for today's technology and communication-savvy world, so, like somebody you can't contact en masse for that period of time, I think that's really a signal of something's really wrong. (soft tense music) That morning we sent out two C-130s. There was no airport to speak of. This is not something that we experienced before. I think they need our help. This is bad. - The level of destruction was something that I wasn't prepared for. Had an idea but as we were coming in on the C-130 we could look out the window and actually see Tacloban from an aerial view. It was very humbling in a way. (dramatic music) - When our Marines got to Tacloban we were able to get down there, we were able to clear that runway and open it up. - Got it? - Right, let's go. - Let's go. - So one C-130 with this friendly general was left behind and the other one took in the first batch of evacuees, meaning those who are really needing medical attention. Those were the children and the women. We needed water, telecommunications equipment, tents, and we needed to set up a command network, at least at that first few critical hours. - I was able to carry a little girl off of one of these flights back to the evacuation center. She's probably about four years old and holding her in my arms just made me think about my own kids and what I would be doing if I was in this situation, and it was a moment in which I was very proud to be a Marine and very proud to be an American. - Security personnels were brought in. The army and the National Police were the priorities in the flight. Most of the security personell were those who are providing the services in the area, either they're dead or they're looking for their dead or they got swept away. The difference with going to battle and restoring order is that when you go to battle, you have a specific objective. Now here, the objective here is just to assure our brothers and sisters down south that hey, help is coming, don't panic, so they're us. They're basically us so we don't have to really intimidate them, rather than assure them. - And after doing that live report people started to approach me giving me pieces of paper with phone numbers on it, with names on it, for me to contact these persons to tell their families that they are all alive. That night we went back to Tacloban for our colleagues, the satellite team, so I told them we'll come back for you. We'll look for food and water for you. By Saturday we were still there, filming all the devastation and deaths. - When they learned that the evacuees will be coming in here at Villamor, you see, from kids bringing in some relief bags that they got from their allowance, to organized corporate people chipping in, passing their hats to chip in something. - It's very surprising to see all this help from the other countries sending food, money, even military personnel in whatever capacity they can just to help the Philippines. I'm sure a lot of people in Tacloban, most of them, even myself, I'm overwhelmed by the help that we've been getting from a lot of people internationally, and it goes to show that a lot of people from all over the world love the Philippines, love the Philippines. - Well, it's called the bayanihan spirit, bayanihan. It means that we help out each other. You see, the bayanihan spirit, as we have seen by the odd corps support from just about anywhere, foreign and domestic, makes you think that bayanihan is universal. - You feel so helpless when, you know, a lot of our roots are at home and a lot of bad stuff is going on but then also we're able to rally 'round each other to start raising funds and start sending stuff home to help people out. - There's this contagious humor of the Filipinos that despite all this happening, they can still crack jokes, they can still laugh, they can still smile as long as they're together or at least their families are together they're happy. - The Filipino people were amazing to us. They treated us really well. Everywhere we went we'd be walking through their neighborhoods and people that were getting assistance and were getting rice were actually offering that up to us, asking us to come into their house. Everybody we passed on the street was thanking us for their time, was very gracious, waving and just smiles all around and it's something that, you know, you don't expect that as you're coming into a disaster area. You don't see that kinda response, you don't see people that are really happy and just generally in their worst moments are also in what I would consider some of the best moments I've seen people in. Very friendly, very humble and just very thankful for our response. - When I came down to Tacloban on one of the flights into the area we had displaced people and evacuees coming up to us and thanking us and it's one of the most proud moments of my life is to be able to help out our friends. - I have been exposed to a lot of typhoon coverages in the Philippines but Yolanda was really a lot more different considering the devastation, the death that it has brought to Tacloba and nearby provinces and the numbers affected by Yolanda itself was indeed extraordinary. The next time I would be assigned to cover disasters like this I will really take a step higher in terms of preparation and being careful. It's just too much for us human beings. It's just too much. - I am not only a victim, I am a survivor. (laughs) But I refuse to be helpless, I refuse to be a victim. I say I am a victor. Let us not be made of victims. Let us become victors. - I do believe that they can rebuild. They can rebuild, definitely. They would rise but it would take some time, but definitely they would do it. It's just a test for them to be stronger, to be able to go beyond this disaster.
