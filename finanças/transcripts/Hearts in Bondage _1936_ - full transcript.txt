[bell ringing] [music playing] [music playing] [MUSIC - "BATTLE HYMN OF THE REPUBLIC"] Join the Seventh Militia, sir. New York's best. [music playing] Join the seventh militia, gentlemen. New York's best. [laughing] No luck there, soldier. No, sir. And war with the Rebels any day now, sir. I should suggest a more persuasive tone or a more persuasive tune. Why remind the gentlemen that John Brown's molding in the bay? Right you are, lieutenant. He's always right. Come on. Something lively. [lively music plays] That's better. BOTH: [SINGING] And soft the girls of Italy. And Spanish eyes are thrilling. Still, though I bask beneath their smiles, their charms never bind me. And I promise never to gainsay the girl I left behind me. [laughing] Well, here's where I leave you sailor. My respect to your uncle. And mine to your father. My sister Constance? That Raymond, is a matter I shall attend to personally. There'll be a moon in Central Park tonight. And Julie? And Constance? Aye, aye, sir. Aye, aye. [knocking] Go away I tell you. [knocking] How many times must... Kenneth. [laughing] Roast a fatted calf, Uncle John. I'm home on leave. Don't worry. I roast you plenty. But how was the trip? Oh, it was a grand trip, sir. The Merrimac's mighty seaworthy. Yeah. So was Noah's ark. Here. What are you standing there for? Take the bellows. The fire is dying down. So you... you like the Merrimac, eh? Why, Uncle. She's the greatest ship afloat. There never was or ever will be a ship of war that can stand up to it. Quiet. We don't talk now. We pour. Wooden ships. Bah. You talk like one of those empty office admirals in Washington. Here. Look. A plan of my new ironclad. Simple. I will explain like ABCs. Here is a cross section of a submerged... Uncle, we're going to spend a great deal of time together on this leave. But right now... You just came, and you want to run away. You've got something more important? Well, if you don't mind, the Commodore... Oh. I'm not to mind the Commodore. But you mind the Commodore's daughter, eh. Well, her brother's on leave too, and we have something... More interesting than ships. Well. Have a good time. But tomorrow, you don't get away so easy. Right. Goodbye. [inaudible]. Is my skating so bad? It's far too good. I've been waiting for something romantic to happen. Like? Like your falling down. Kenneth. Just so that I could hold you in my arms. I'm going to sit comfortably here until Raymond comes along. Raymond will keep on in the other direction. Acting under orders. Strictly. I'm his superior officer, you know. And he adores you. That, my dear, is something you should consider. He's talked of nothing but you since he got home. You must have Kenneth tell you this. You must have Kenneth tell you that. That he loves you. No. He didn't say that. He should. Why? Orders. Well, he's on leave. And so am I at the moment. Connie! Wait a minute. Darling. [laughing] Well, you did it. You fell down. I'm afraid I did. Well, aren't you going to help me up? No. I'm going to sit comfortably here until Raymond comes along. On the ice? Why not? The thaw won't set until spring. Well, then, I'll... Darling... You two better get up. You'll have pneumonia. Well, all I can say is that this may be warm. But where they're going to have [inaudible] something else again. Julie, I think that's terrible, eavesdropping like that. We weren't eavesdropping, Connie. We were just watching. Well, then, I guess I better explain. You see... You're engaged right here in the middle of the lake. Well, that is... Why, congratulations, sir. She couldn't have picked a better man than you. She had us kind of worried being 23, unhitched, and still hanging around the house. I don't know how you do it, Connie. I've been falling down all evening. Only to find that some folks can get engaged the minute they hit the ice. I advise you, sir, to make immediate report to the Commodore. I certainly am excited. This is so thrilling. It's left me speechless. Positively, speechless. Julie, I'm just trying to tell you that Connie hasn't accepted me yet. Oh. Then, you're not engaged. Well, no, you see... Yes, we are. [laughing] Father, I want to tell you... I'm sorry, dear. But Captain Buchanan and I have an urgent call to Washington. Ooh, daddy. Has something happened? I haven't time to talk now, honey. But everything is going to be all right. Raymond, take charge of things here. I wouldn't worry, darling. It may not be anything serious. Gentlemen, this is serious business. Delegates from six cotton states have met in Montgomery, Alabama and formed the Confederate States of America. Virginia has called a state convention to decide whether or not she will succeed. Among you gentlemen there are two native born Virginians. It is imperative that the affairs of the Navy department be undertaken with no division of loyalty. I must, therefore, ask these two gentlemen to declare their intentions should their native state follow the course of her southern sisters. Captain Buchanan? The question raised by Mr. Secretary has been weighing heavily upon me these past few months. I was born in Virginia, the son of Virginians. Birth has determined my decision. As my state goes, so must I. It is with regret that I am compelled to tender my resignation from the United States Navy. Goodnight, gentlemen. And you, Commodore Jordan? I have seen 47 years service in the Navy. Until I was assigned to duty in the North, Captain Buchanan was my neighbor. Our children grew up together. I hope he will ever be my friend. I too have a kindred feeling for my home state, Virginia. But any section of the land over which Old Glory waves is my home. I gather from your words, sir, the sentiments of Stephen Decatur. "My country may she ever be right. But right or wrong, my country." Mr. President. I'm at your service. Julie, it won't be long. Mr. Lincoln doesn't want war. I'm afraid your Mr. Lincoln has practically declared war. Raymond and Julie only have a few minutes left. Goodbye, Julie. Regardless of what's decided for us, we're still friends, aren't we? Goodbye, dear. Try to remember that wars were made by men, not women. Nothing can hurt our friendship and our love. Oh, Connie. Excuse me, child. It's mighty close to starting. We'll wait in the carriage. Julie, I... I reckon you hate me now. Don't you? Honey, I couldn't hate you, because I love you. It's best we say goodbye here. Aren't you going to let me put you on the train? Julie, what's happened to you? Don't you put your arms around me wearing that uniform. Once, you were proud of my wearing this uniform. I haven't changed. You have. You'll be fighting against my father. You can't love me and aim to kill those I love. Come, Julie. It's time. [whimper] Now, now. No tears. Goodbye, young man. Bye, sir. Didn't you take her to the train? She wouldn't let me. She wouldn't let me touch her. That's what it means, hate. Hate for those we love. She's just a little girl. She doesn't understand. Neither do I. Well, we better go, Raymond. The Commodore wants to see us. As the situation stands, we pray for peace while we prepare for war. All leave has been cancelled. You'll return to your ship immediately. Yes, sir. Ports, arsenals, and other government property are being seized in the name of the Southern Confederacy. We must make every... Just a moment, sir. Before divulging further confidential matters. Please hear what I have to say. This is a breach of conduct, sir. I'm giving orders. Sorry, sir. - I'm not taking them. - Raymond! Sir. Because I'm resigning from the United States Navy. Raymond, you don't know what you're doing. I know that everything I hold dear belongs to Virginia. And so do I. You have sworn to defend the Constitution of the United States. I'll renounce that vow to fulfill a more sacred duty. You realize that your decision places us on opposing sides? I'll regret that deeply, sir. Ken, thanks for all you've taught me. I hope I'll make a worthy opponent. Goodbye, father. Goodbye, son. Report with these to Captain Gilman in command of Gosport Navy Yard, Norfolk. In the absence of Captain Batterman and Captain Pierson, you will be placed in temporary command of USS Merrimac. Yes, sir. You realize the necessity of preserving for the Union the ship's armament and ammunition stored there? I do, sir. Then, I needn't further stress the importance of this assignment. Good luck. Thank you, sir. First, Raymond. And now, you. Well, Raymond has his duty, and so have I. What a strange idea of duty, to rush out and kill. Oh. It isn't that. Raymond thinks it's his duty to take up arms against father, and you love me. And yet, you think it's your duty to fight against my brother. Connie, there isn't any war yet. And if it happens, it won't last long. That'll be small comfort to the families who are destroyed. It's time for me to go now. You won't let me see you cry. Will you? Then, don't let me see you leave. I'll turn around and talk to you about the night... the night we were skating and you placed a rustic bench beneath the leaf of the tree. And I laughed. Skated away, and I fell down. But don't you realize, Captain Buchanan, every moment we delay may prove more costly than we know? That's right. With Norfolk Navy Yard in federal hands our city can be shelled and destroyed in 24 hours. You young men are fired with excitement and eagerness. The fact is war has not yet been declared. Not in so many words. But war is here, sir. It was actually begun when South Carolina fired on Fort Sumter. [arguing] Well, you hear that. It's war. Sure enough. Raymond knows. Virginia's state militia is ready to act. I say let's seize the navy yard. Gentlemen, you must not take violent action at this time. Now is the time for action. We want no more delays. [bickering] The time is not yet here. How can you say that, sir, when you know the North have declared a blockade on southern ports? And that means we'll be starved out in six months. You all going to wait for that? ALL: No! All right then. We'll take Norfolk Navy Yard tonight. Are you with us, men? ALL: Yes! [cheering] [music playing] Oh, and speaking of love. There's real love for you. Well, there you are, Molly old girl. You're no prettier, but you're cleaner. Lieutenant. At ease, Paddy. This isn't official. Well, sir. It's glad we all are to see you back here. - Thank you. - Look it. Even Molly recognizes you. See the sparkle of her. It's no use, Molly. The lieutenant's engaged. Although I still can't believe it. Why not? I always thought you were in love with The Merrimac. This old tub is mighty close to my heart. Halt. Who goes there? Lieutenant Cosgrove, with a dispatch for Captain Gilman. Pass. Are you sure, Cosgrove? There are three regiments? - Yes, sir. - Fully armed? Yes, sir. Their advance guard will reach here at any moment. Three regiments. We'll never be able to hold out against such a force. Evans, Perkins, Schmidt, each of you are to take a detail. We must destroy the yard. Captain Gilman, did you say destroy the yard, sir? I did. This navy yard is invaluable to the Union. The loss in arms, equipment, and ammunition alone would be tremendous. Is it wise, sir, to destroy it? It is rather than to have it fall into Confederate hands. And when I wish for your advice, lieutenant, I shall ask for it. Yes, sir. Now, remember. Not a single musket must be left to be salvaged by the enemy. Now, hurry. Hurry. [explosion] All right, men. Stand clear. [explosion] Halt. The Merrimac. Double time. Hark. Enemy forces advancing. Orders are to destroy the boat. Let's find your ship at once. Burn The Merrimac? That's insane. I can take her out of the harbor. - Don't be a fool, lieutenant. - I'm not. With our guns trained on the city, we can keep them off until reinforcements arrive. You will obey Captain Gilman's orders. My orders are to protect government property, not destroy it. Sound general quarters. Prepare to get under way. We're taking her to sea. Careful, Reynolds. After all, this is Gilman's responsibility. This ship is my responsibility. Yes, sir. That's open mutiny, sir. Captain Gilman ordered that you fire your ship without delay. Have you those orders in writing, sir? There wasn't time for writing. Then, as commanding officer of this ship I refuse to execute such verbal orders. All right, men. Fire the ship. Stand back. I'm going to sink it. What? We'll at least save our hull and engines from the fire. Stand them off. Yes, sir. The only ones to get by will be dead. Here. One of help me. Help me. Give me a hand. Will ya. Here. Help me, someone. Help me. Let that gun go. Get off before you burnt to a cinder. I'll budge no budge without Molly. The man's mad. Lieutenant Reynolds, I call you to account for your actions. I'll answer to the board of inquiry. In your panic, you had us set a fire. I flooded her to save the hull and engines. Saved her for the enemy to be raised as good as new. I charge you with conduct unbecoming an officer, with insubordination, and mutiny. Place him under arrest. In view of the fact that a state of war did not exist at the time such mutinous acts were committed, sentences as prescribed in articles for the government of the United States Navy in time of peace. Therefore, it is the sentence of this court martial that the defendant be dismissed from the United States Naval Service with a dishonorable discharge. [boom] [boom] And I've learned other dishes too. You'll find me a very fine cook. [booming in the distance] Kenneth, have you been listening? Yes. Oh, yes. There's fighting going on somewhere over there. Oh, please try to think of something else. I'll try. What were you saying? I was trying to tell you that I'm so very happy. I'm glad. It's... it's over there somewhere. Kenneth, you've got to bring yourself out of it. You must forget the war. You're out of it. There's so much ahead if... if you'll only face it. You seem to forget that I'm now without citizenship, without honor. You're not without honor to me. There's far too many who think otherwise. But it doesn't matter what others think. And deep down within me I... I'm pleased. Oh, with war all around, maybe it's unpatriotic to feel as I do. Maybe it's selfish to want you safe and near me. But I won't be safely near you. What do you mean? Regardless of the findings of my superiors, I still have my self-respect. Well, of course, you have, dear. Connie, I can't marry you. Not now. But darling, I told you I don't care what others think. Do you hear that? Out there men are dying while I... Connie, can't you see? I must do something. You will. There's a world, you know, outside the Navy. And people live in it and are happy. Need any men? Why ain't you in the army? We ain't hiring nobody of military age. [parade music playing] This is sure a great day for us. What? Well, joining the United States Navy. Maybe. Say. Ain't you patriotic? Yeah. Strangely patriotic. SOLDIER: Hey, you, mister. Stephens. Ed Stephens. All right. Get along. Introduce yourself inside. I wouldn't go in there if I were you, Reynolds. It wouldn't be much use. Funny talking fella that. The Navy's getting [inaudible] particular [inaudible]. Did they turn you down too? Not us. We uh... we got a berth. You're lucky. It shouldn't be hard for a seafaring gent like you to get one. Well, it has been. Maybe you ain't tried the right places. Good sailors is hard to get. Huh. Maybe I'm not a good sailor. We understand you are, one of the best. Say we could use a fella like you, one who knows the waters around Hampton Roads. What's the ship? Well, we ain't saying, but we can put you in the way of making $200 a trip for yourself, besides getting even with a lot of blokes. Just what blokes do you mean? Well, they call them Yankees down around the harbor where they're raising The Merrimac. Raising The Merrimac? Are you sure? Oh, stow it, Lieutenant Reynolds. You helped sink her, didn't you? So the South could raise and make an ironclad. Am I right? That's what they say. We'll they got to have iron, you see. With your help we can run it through. Blockade running, eh. Well, you've got the wrong man. Wrong man, huh. That's funny coming from you. Why, everybody knows you were a traitor to the North, a spy. Riot! Help! Help! Riot! Hey. Hey. What's going on here? Hey, what's the matter? What's going on? Listen, officer, these men... Help me, officer. Help. We was walking along minding our own business when this renegade here tries to get us to join up in blockade running. That's what he does. Easy there. That's a serious charge. That's a lie. Are you sure, Reynolds? Do you know this man? Yes. He's Kenneth Reynolds. Ah, he's the man who sank The Merrimac, huh. Yeah. It would be a bad day for the Navy if he joined up. - He's a spy. - He's a traitor. That's what he is. [protesting] No more riots, or I'll arrest all of you. Inciting a riot. Sedition. This is a mistake I tell you. Sedition. It's a great mistake. - You'll find that out. - Look, sergeant. I don't care what you do with me. But I just heard they're raising The Merrimac - and making an ironclad of it. - Are they now? And we ought to notify the Navy department at once. Maybe you'd like to have us send you to tell them. Huh? Take him away. Come on. How much powder you using? 50 pounds, sir. 50 pounds? Think the gun will stand it. If she don't, the joke's on us. If that armor plate can stand up to the charge, the joke will be on the Yankees. [laughing] Loaded, sir. Fire when ready. Stand clear. [booming] It's only a dent! With this The Merrimac can whip anything. Mrs. Davis, that's a goodly donation. Almost all the iron I had. Though it's just a few odds and ends. Mighty precious odds and ends. You ready? Yes, 'um. Thank you, ma'am. Miss Julie, I be trying to figure what Master Raymond going to do with all of this here iron. Is for their big boat, Sam. The one all the way down at the bay. The Merrimac. But Miss Julie, what they going to do with the iron? Make an iron ship out of her. An iron ship? How they all going to make an iron ship? Miss Julie, anybody knows iron don't float. [laughs] Well, Mr. Raymond says it will. [metal clanging] Whoa. Whoa. More precious metal. Quite a raid. Good work, honey. We went to every plantation for miles around. Master Raymond, this here is my own donation. Why, that's uncommon patriotic of you, Mamie. I always figured on keeping this old skillet in memory of poor dear [inaudible]. A present from him? No, Master Raymond. He showed it to me just before he died. Thank you, ma'am. Better unload this stuff at the smelter. Raymond, are you sure that you can float an iron ship? I've never been more sure in my life. Why with The Merrimac dressed up in iron, we'll smashed that Yankee blockade and end this war by fall. Oh, I'm so proud of you. BOY: Hey, fella. Here's a partner for you. Don't let me discompose you, young fella. I'll just squat down here for a spell. That's all right. You won't bother me. Not for more than 30 days I won't. Hey, ain't you Lieutenant Reynolds? No. No? I must be looking through the wrong eye. Might have got my patch displaced in that saloon skirmish. Can't see a thing. Yep. Good eye all right. Of course, I know how you feel. I remember the time I served with Farragut. If you don't mind, I'd rather not talk. I guess you don't. There ain't much better you can say after letting The Merrimac fall into Confederate hands. Hey, BOY: Freckles. Hey, fellas. Now, let me see you knock it off. [inaudible] sure got the North running around like chickens with their heads cut off. What are you talking about? Ooh. The governments asking for bids on iron gunboats to fight off The Merrimac before she busts the whole blockade. How do you know all this? Hey, don't you ever read the paper? Oh. I suppose you wouldn't here. BOY: Hey, freckles. Look at your boat now. What in tarnation you looking at? That's it. That'll do it. Hey, what's come over you, man? That's it. That will do it. Jailer! Jailer! What's the matter here? I must get word to John Ericsson. Understand? John Ericsson. The inventor? Yes. I must get word to him. Outrageous stupidity. That's what it is. And you will pay for it. I'll have him out of here in the twinkling of an eye. Oh, my boy. I'm glad you've come. So I hunt for you high and low, and all the time you're safe in jail. Never mind me now. Have you submitted the plans for your Monitor to Washington. I've got other things to do than waste my time. Who do I see to get him out of here? But they're looking frantically for an ironclad. Let them look. I told them what would happen, but they wouldn't listen to me. Now, where are they? Come. Come. Who do I see? There's only one thing that will stop The Merrimac, Ericcson's Monitor. - You better see the chief of... - Quiet. Quiet. We're talking business. The Merrimac carries ten heavy guns. The Monitor only two. That's enough if you put them on a revolving turret. A revolving turret? Yes. Here. Without having to maneuver the ship about, The Monitor can keep those two guns constantly trained on The Merrimac. And that will more than equal The Merrimac's heavier but stationary armament. Say, that sounds like a good idea. It is a good idea. By golly. I think maybe it will work. - It will work. - Then, what are we waiting for? Just a minute. He's going to build a battleship. Is that so? Well, he'll have a little trouble getting it out of his cell. Sir, do you know who I am? John Ericsson. I'll bring pressure to bear. I'll take this to a higher court. I'll see President Lincoln. Oh, I'll get you out. Wait right here. Hello, Miss Adams. Hello, Miss Jordan. Don't bother to announce me. I'll go right down. If I may say so, miss, it's like putting your head in a noose. Still hard at it, huh. Night and day. They don't sleep. They won't eat. I fear going out, ma'am. Maybe this will tempt them. MRS. JORDAN: Good luck. Oh, I'm not frightened. [knocking] JOHN ERICSSON: Go away. Steady. Steady. Too late to make mistakes now. [coughing] Can I work in such a bedlam? Constance. You told me to come today. That it would be finished. And finished it is. Don't you look until she get her tough nut on. Behold The Monitor. There it is. I've never seen anything quite like it. You're right. There never has been anything quite like it. Oh, I am happy. Also, very hungry. Mm. One. I am very happy. Oh, that's to christen The Monitor. Fine. You can break it over the bow and let the wine flow. I'd rather such good wine flows this way. Are you going to take it to Washington? At once. Father says Mr. Bushnell is submitting plans for an ironclad too. Bushnell? He's the biggest ship builder in all the land. But I'm the best. And besides, ships don't go on land. The Monitor. The Monitor. The Monitor. I will not bother to introduce myself, because you all know who I am. Mr. Secretary of the Navy, we have met before. And Senator Pillsbury, I have had the misfortune to deal with. However, we have no time. My model. Mr. Ericsson, we've examined your plans, but I fail to see how the guns can be fired from your ship. Why don't you study how to read plans? From the drawings you will find it is from the revolving turret that we do the firing, through the metal ports. One good shot against that turret, and there wouldn't be any firing. So? I show you. No shot can stop it. No matter how hard you hit the turret, it turns. That's quite all right, Captain Ericsson. I'm sure your turret will work. But we've already awarded the contract to Bushnell. You have already awarded. Why you... SECRETARY OF THE NAVY: The committee has just approved the contract. Then, you have made a mistake. A very bad mistake. Possibly. I shall be glad to resubmit your plans to the board. If Mr. Bushnell and his associates should fail us. Don't worry. He will. About warships he knows even less than your committee. KENNETH: Waiter. JOHN ERICSSON: Waiter. Another. SOLDIER: I know your capacity, Uncle John, but don't you think... What else is there for me to do but drink in a town like this. You keep me here surrounded by politicians and gold braiders. Why don't we go back to New York, where we can work. But the Union needs your "Monitor," and sooner or later, they'll realize it. They realize nothing. I tell you I won't stay here another day. Not another... put that down. [inaudible]. Has everybody in Washington got wooden heads? Mint julep please. What did you say, sir? I asked for a mint julep, and unless I'm mistaken, you heard me ask for a mint julep. I presume you realize, sir, you asked for a southern drink. I beg your pardon, but my name is Errol Shultz, vice president of the Union Loyalty League. And I'll have you know... Pardon me. My name is Commodore David G. Farragut of the United States Navy. Oh. I beg your pardon. I'll grant it if you'll let me stand a round of mint julep. Sure. Why not? That's fine. After all, it's the men of the South we're fighting, not their liquor. That's a good one. Would you gentlemen care to join us? Oh. Captain Ericsson, I'm right glad to see you, sir. Well, I'm glad somebody's glad to see me. How are you, Commodore? My nephew, Kenneth Reynolds. Oh, how do you do, sir? How do you do? I'd deem it most friendly if you'd join me at the bar. This is my good friend Mr. Bushnell. I know Captain Ericsson. And I know him. Ah. What are you doing in Washington? Nothing. All the great work has already been done. Captain Ericsson submitted a model of his Monitor to the Navy department. Oh. The Monitor. I sure would like to see it. Would you, sir? It's right up in the room. We can take you up there if you like. This should interest you, Bushnell. It should, but it won't. My Monitor is not on exhibition. But this may be the chance to... This is final. Nobody sees my Monitor. Bartender, another round of mint juleps. And so you see, how without maneuvering around, we keep on firing. Boom. Boom. Boom. Genius, my dear friend. Sheer genius. You hear that, Kenneth? From the finest ship builder in the country. You honor me, sir. Oh. It's I who am honored. [laughing] It just goes to prove what I've always said. Commodore Farragut is an amazing man. Oh, he's a magnificent man. And the mint juleps, were they his idea? KENNETH: Naturally. How many did it take? Surprisingly few. Uncle John started to mellow after the seventh. And would you believe... Oh, do sit down. You're getting far too excited. I have reason to be. I have work to do. I am finally going to be of some use. And what's Mr. Bushnell like? He's a man of great generosity. He willingly sacrificed his plans and took us in on the contract. Oh, I'm so happy. That's the best news of all. And do you start work immediately? Full speed ahead. Oh, there I go. Let me wind. I can't sit still. We'll build the greatest warship that ever fired a salvo. I'll think of it only as building a great ship. Let's celebrate. How? Would you consider dining sumptuously with me at the Beauvard House? I've a new dress that's just aching to see the Beauvard House. Then, I'll call for you in a coach at 4:00. Of course, we'll take Uncle John along. And on second thought, the Commodore. Oh, can't we dine alone? You see, darling, we take Uncle John for financial reasons. And father? He has the coach. [laughing] But only one horse. Come here. [clears throat] Hereafter, I'll require a salute of at least 21 guns before entering a conservatory. Commodore, you're... you're just the man I want to see. Will you bring your coach... uh, uh, will you bring your horse? Uh. You tell him. I can't. I'll go home and dress. You better get into your Sunday uniform. We're dining out. What's the matter, dear? Oh nothing. Nothing. I am a bit tired. Well, cheer up, darling. We're going out to celebrate Kenneth's good fortune. Kenneth's good fortune? What's disturbing you, dear? Is it bad news? Is it Raymond? Tell me. Raymond has been appointed third in command aboard The Merrimac. It's a promotion, isn't it? Going aboard The Merrimac. Yes. The ship we have to destroy. With The Monitor. Ericsson's Monitor. MAN: All together, men. Ram her home. [music playing] I'm afraid Ericsson's Monitor didn't do so well in the trial. The steering gear jammed, but it's been fixed. You think it will work now? I do, sir. Many of our naval experts, as you know, report the ship unseaworthy and impracticable for combat duty. I don't agree with them, Mr. Secretary. Good. The president, sir. Good morning, gentlemen. Be seated. Lieutenant Worden. The Secretary tells me that you volunteered to command The Monitor. Yes, Mr. President. My compliments. Thank you, sir. Although I share your confidence in The Monitor, I should never permit it to go out just yet were it not that our cause is in desperate straits. I understand, sir. Do not assign a crew. It should be manned solely by volunteers. In view of the many criticisms already heaped upon her, that is very wise, Mr. President. See that each volunteer before signing is warned of the dangers of the adventure and the odds against it. WORDEN: Yes, sir. Assure them however that the government will take care of their families should they not survive. And now, good luck and Godspeed. Take these men to Lieutenant Green aboard ship. Well, that gives us nine officers and 37 men. It's been more difficult getting volunteers - than we expected. - Yeah. The appearance hasn't helped us any. Paddy. Mack. We got your word, sir. We're reporting for duty. Oh, I knew I could count on you. - How've you been? - Fine, sir. Excepting Paddy here has never been quite the same since he lost Molly. Lieutenant Worden, this is MacPherson and Callahan. They served with me on The Merrimac. Both good men. Glad to have them aboard. Meaning no offense, sir, but how does an able-bodied seaman get aboard such a looking object? Use your head, man. The lieutenant helped build it. He'll know how to get on it. We'll watch him and do likewise. But I'm not going. Oh, then you're not so daft as I thought you were. I'm sorry, sir. We'd go to sea in a tin can with him. But if he's not going, well, we're not going either. But they need you boys. I'd give anything to go, but Paddy, you know that's impossible. I'm no longer in the Navy. Oh, so they don't think you're good enough to sail on it? Oh, it isn't that. Reynolds, you know the ship pretty well. - Don't you? - I ought to. How would you like to come along with us? How would I like to come along? Thanks very much, sir. But that's impossible. Why? Well, I've been dis... dismissed. I know all about that. But I've been given the right to pick a volunteer crew. Pack your bags and report for duty. Aye, aye, sir. Begging your pardon, sir. If you please. Report aboard to Lieutenant Green. We sail tonight after dark. It's relieved, I am. You know I wouldn't like any of my friends to see me aboard that in broad daylight. Aye. These plans you should have in your head. I don't really need them. Well, take them along anyway for reference maybe. I wish you were coming along too, Captain. What? Me? You've hit his weakness, Lieutenant Worden. He builds ships, but... I don't ride on them. I get seasick. Congratulations, Captain Ericsson. You've done splendidly. Nothing unusual. What did you expect? We of the committee are here to make a final tour of inspection before The Monitor sails. All right. Everything is fixed. The Monitor is ready. And nothing you can say will even make me mad. You better get aboard, Reynolds. May I have a moment to say goodbye, sir? Goodbye? Why, yes. Just a moment. Reynolds' work on The Monitor is finished. What do you know about it? He's reporting for duty, sir. On what authority? I've been given the right to select a volunteer crew. Reynolds was dishonorably discharged from the Navy. Captain Gilman, I helped build The Monitor. I know every rivet and seam in her. Lieutenant Worden needs me, wants me, and has accepted me for duty. I think his achievement in helping to construct the ship in record time should more than outweigh whatever has happened in the past. Absolutely right. If he had carried out my orders at Norfolk, there'd be no Merrimac threatening us today. I agree with Captain Gilman. This ship's mission is too secretive to include among its officers a man guilty of mutiny. Lieutenant Worden is subject to our orders. This is a case for us to decide. For you to decide? No, I, John Ericsson decides. He goes. You forget yourself, sir. I... I forget not. I don't forget this ship is not paid for. And until then, she is mine. If Reynolds don't go, The Monitor stays right here tied to the dock. And you go fight The Merrimac with your speeches. I think that settles it, gentlemen. Ha. We go. Maybe you find something wrong, eh. Then, you don't feel so bad. Darling, our first victory. I'm going after all. Aren't you glad? Should I be? Well, well, I... I thought for my... Why do you insist upon going? Your work on The Monitor is completed. They don't even want you. But darling, this is my one chance. I hardly dared hoped for it, and it's come. Don't you see? This is a chance to vindicate myself. No. There was a time when I didn't even want you to go on with the work, but then I realized that with or without your help The Monitor would be built. But I've got to see it through. You don't realize how vital it is that The Monitor succeeds. Its success will spell failure for you and me. My brother is an officer on The Merrimac. Raymond? Raymond. That's why I stood here, hoping that those men wouldn't let you go. There's nothing left but to beg you not to. Nothing I can say to you now will ever make you see this as I do. Ken, there's work to do out on the West Coast. They're building harbors and ships. Why do you stand there staring at me? I know that you're going. I can't forgive it. I never will. Don't let me leave you like this. There's no other way. [fog horn blows] What's Ericsson's idea, having us wait up here? Might as well. He'll never grant us an interview any other place. I've seen some freaks, but that boat certainly takes the prize. Crazy Ericsson. Remember when those guns exploded and killed six men on The Princeton? REPORTER 1: Yeah. REPORTER 2: They say there's a storm coming up. 20 to 1, none of that crew ever come back. [fog horn blows] There she goes. The Iron Coffin, a good name for her. [trumpet blowing] Gentlemen, Commodore Buchanan will address you. Our mission is to clear this harbor of enemy craft, of which The Cumberland, The Congress, and The Minnesota now ride before us. Their fire cannot hurt us, so disregard it. And remember, what you do today will be the history of tomorrow. Our homes, our wives, our children shall be free if we succeed. That is all. ALL: Hooray! Hooray! Lieutenant, get under way immediately. You must first attack The Cumberland. Aye, aye, sir. Sound general quarters. [trumpet blowing] Standby. [cannons booming] Thank you, Yankees. What is it? A stronger sub. Barely hit. Had no effect. We'll give them a bump. [cannons booming] Standby to ram. Hold on! Ready. Up, men. Over the side. The Cumberland is sinking. Attack The Congress. Aye, aye, sir. [cannons booming] Fire! [cannons booming] Quick. Help me get the commodore below. It's nothing serious. Hold to your course. Keep firing. [cannons booming] Tide's going out. Chance of running aground in this smoke, sir. I had hoped to attack The Minnesota. But let's take no risk. We can finish the rest tomorrow. Well, Mr. Secretary? Sir, The Merrimac is sweeping the Union fleet before her. She will besiege the Northern cities and levy tribute from of them. Why, even the capital will be at the mercy of the guns from The Merrimac. What of The Monitor? The Monitor, if she ever does reach Hampton Roads, which I doubt, The Merrimac will blow her out of the water. She's falling off her course, sir. Engine room. Engine room. We're losing headway. Keep turning over. Aye, aye, sir. Men, we've got to keep the pressure up. Aye, aye. Any more news of The Monitor? Lost. Unreported after 72 hours. It's not true. I don't believe it. We just had word from the Secretary of the Navy. Washington's steeped in gloom. There's no hope that she could have survived the storm. This is the end of John Ericsson. First The Princeton and now The Monitor. You think of nothing but your ships. What of those men? What of Kenneth? Oh, I don't forget those men. I don't forget that boy ever. Gentlemen, you'll be pleased to hear that Commodore Buchanan is doing very nicely. Unfortunately, however, he is unable to be with us today. Lieutenant Jones assumes command. We will complete the mission started yesterday. By nightfall, I'm confident that there will not be a Union vessel left in Hampton Roads. ALL: Hooray. We will first attack The Minnesota. Aye, aye, sir. Sound general quarters. [trumpet blowing] Sound general quarters. [trumpet blowing] Don't open fire. We're going to ram. Aye, sir. Jordan. Jordan, look. What in tarnation is it? I don't know, but [laughing] it looks to me like a cheese box on a raft. So that's The Monitor. That cute little thing. Hey, let's take it aboard and keep it for a pet. [laughing] Mind your range. Aye, aye, sir. One gun. Stand ready to fire. Give it a whirl, sir. There you are, young lady. And if you do a good job, I will learn to like you too. Fire. [cannons booming] Standby for broadside. Standby for broadside. [cannons booming] Are you hurt, sir? They got her. Nothing could stand a fire like that. But you're wrong, sir. Look. [cheering] Lieutenant Worden is badly wounded, sir. He orders you to take command. Lieutenant Ulrich, take charge of the turret. Aye, aye, sir. Reynolds, you're in command of the number two gun. Aye, aye, sir. Take over. Aye, aye, sir. How does she stand? [inaudible]. Powder up. Ready. Fire. [cannons booming] Our broadside doesn't seem to have done any damage. Never mind The Monitor. We'll steer around her and finish The Minnesota. Aye, aye, sir. It's making for The Minnesota. Head it off. Aye, aye, sir. [cannons booming] [cheering] [telegraph clicking] Three hours of hammer and tongs, and they're still at it. The man who said Ericsson was crazy is crazy. This Monitor is miraculous. [cannons booming] Hold it. She's full. Paddy, come on. Come on, boys. You too. Duck! Duck! That was [inaudible]. Paddy. Paddy. Paddy. She's... she's a great gun. Oh, Paddy. Take him below. Carry on. Keep both guns going. Aye, aye, sir. [inaudible] Step lively. The tide is very low, sir. If we don't return now, we'll go aground on a sandbar and be at their mercy. Pardon me, sir. May I suggest a boarding party? It's a long chance. But we can try. Pull alongside The Monitor. Good luck. If we fail to capture her, we'll turn back. We're going to lay alongside The Monitor. Who will volunteer to help me take her? ALL: I. RAYMOND: Then, come on. They're aiming to board us. What's your order? Fire! [cannons booming] She ceased fire. Looks like she's turning back. [cheering] We done it! [inaudible] ALL: Hooray! Don't grieve so, honey child. It don't do no good. And I kept telling him how proud I was of him. He did look mighty fine in that grey uniform. What does it matter, blue or grey? If only no one would ever wear any uniform. [clock chiming] [wind gusting] [knocking] Yes. It's Master Kenneth. He done come to see Miss Constance. What do I tell him, sir? Tell him to come in. BUTLER: Yes, sir. Kenneth, I'm glad you've come. That's very generous of you, sir. I've been reading a letter from Commodore Buchanan. He writes that Raymond died gallantly. And I killed him. Not you... war. I grieve for my son, but I'm proud he died for the ideals he held. Ideals. What costly things. What must be is not for us to say. You'll find Constance on that path along the Potomac. I can't go to her. You came to see her, didn't you? Yes. Then go. Constance. Please, Kenneth. I know there isn't much I can say. What is there to say? Raymond died gallantly. You were only doing your duty. There's nothing else. Except to keep on loving you. Long ago, I said that all the wars in all the world couldn't stop me from doing that. I should hate you, but I can't. There's no hate left in me. No feeling. Nothing. Good morning, Miss Jordan. Why, Mr. Lincoln. I walk here often. It's the trees. They're above the bickerings of men. Oh, uh, may I? This is Kenneth Reynolds. Kenneth Reynolds of The Monitor. Yes, sir. My humble thanks. Tomorrow, a grateful government will publicly acknowledge the wrongs done to you. Mr. President, may I speak plainly? By all means. It isn't honor nor reinstatement I seek. I've seen destruction. Men died. I saw my best friend die. I see them too as I walk this path. If I could only remain forever in the dark away from the rising sun that brings to light their numbers increased by thousands. But there's no turning back. We must finish the work we're in lest those who have already gone will have died in vain. You're both young. Yours will be the good fortune to survive. Let's hope that from you will come a generation with vision broad enough to realize the futility of war. I'll never forget this talk, sir. And I shall remember you always, Mr. Lincoln. That's uncommon kind of you, ma'am. Thank you.
