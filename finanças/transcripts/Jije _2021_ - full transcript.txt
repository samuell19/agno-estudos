My atheist brother wants me to go see the creepy ass voodoo queen of DeLisle because of dreams yeah I know how it sounds okay the bottom line is the doctors and pills haven't been doing sh-t right? But from pills to voodoo there's something I never told you At Mrs Goodrich's funeral her husband pulled me aside started going on this rant at the time I figured he was just nuts from grief and sh-t you know he said they were uh I can't remember the damn name anyway something special and some evil thing got in his wife's head made her do the shit that she did he said it was coming for you next Like I said I just figure he was f... king crazy but a year later and all this shit with you has got worse just like he was saying Why didn't you tell me that? Why would I? Thought it's crazy talk But now you believe him I don't know Paul, I don't but a lot of the sh-t that he was saying is starting to make sense he said you start having dreams But they ain't just dreams you start hearing whispers and all this sh-t would keep going Whispers What, has that been happening too?

Same way as yesterday. I don't want to go here I'm going to be right back after I get done with Goodrich. That's not going to take long Try to hurry up Hey. Good luck Asshole Ain't you that Allen boy Yes ma'am Mama's been waiting on you Come on boy She's waiting Mama that boy is here Paul ain't it uh Yes ma'am. Your mama tells me that you've been having some problems Can't sleep feel like you're losing your mind Um yes man something like that You've been having them problems all your life Yes ma'am but not as bad as lately though After miss Goodrich it got worse Yes Hey Mr Goodrich it's Adam Adam Allen Hey you okay? I'm coming in You see people when you wake up at night and they scare you, your mama tells me Why they scare you? Well, they're just standing around my bed and It's people that don't belong in my house I feel terrified and alone because I am alone there's nothing I can do when they're there no one can protect me It's like something bad is waiting for me you know And then something bad came okay uh That's how it got to what it is now the day ms Goodrich died What showed up It was a silhouette of a person like always This one was different. I could see her more clearly than others like I could see details of the silhouette she moved and spoke before grabbing me It felt like she was gonna kill me and make me lose my mind in a way she did in a way I did lose my mind you know What'd she look like Well it looked like she was wearing a cloak or something a filthy old gown it looked and smelled like something from the swamp She said something to me Jije Yes! That's it. What does that mean? What is it?! It's you It's what you are I'm sorry? Many things have been lost over time many things stories, knowledge, magic lost I hate this path for you boy It ain't right that the powers that be make this a burden for you. I don't know who she is but you're not the first to see her My Jonas think that she was the spirit of an old slave woman a pwotege that lost her jije Seems she got no interest in going where she belong She's so filled with anger and she's she's gone mad with grief my Jonas talked about he just said she's just a presence never said nothing about her hurt nobody she's just so sad and she don't want to leave I don't understand You're a jije a judge You know how you can tell someone's good or bad right after you've met them or Like how you know right when something's bad about to happen or like how you always feel so drawn to serve justice to them bullies That's you That's what you were born as I'm sorry I don't follow So the purpose of a jije is to separate the bad energy from the good energies when people die Now this can take a toll on a human's body Especially when you got them spirits that don't want to go to the bad place Many of jije have gone mad trying to do this Them are usually the ones that ain't got they pwotege and so they got no help to fight back what's a pwot.. Pwotege It's a jije soul mate It keeps them grounded and it helps heal them as that bad energy pass through A pwotege can also see a person's inner light and they can commune with the dead Without they pwotege a jije just goes mad Mr Goodrich Mr Goodrich It's started, hasn't it? You... you okay Mr Goodrich? You came about your brother She's getting in his head I came for answers I already tried to give you the answers! Well try telling me again! She's whispering in his ear that girl too Though I don't think she can really hear it She's different Madie It's too late now she's taking us she gets stronger with everyone that she turns It's too late for me What the hell are you talking about? It won't be long now.. ...all the Jije We're all gonna drown in the darkness with her Jije? Yeah.. Judges.. Unwilling pawns in some sick game of.. Whatever the Powers that be Judges? What the hell are you talking about?! Your brother. Me. The end of the world. Your brother is special.. Cursed.. A "judger of souls" He doesn't even know what he is.. If only I had realized it sooner ..and that girl, Madie.. She's his pwotege.. ..without a pwotege a Jije loses their mind, with the souls that pass through them. Wait... So, evil has a consciousness?? Bad things are coming, boy. ...ready yourself. It's too late now... Jesus Christ... I'm wasting my goddamn time.. I'M NOT F... KING WITH YOU! Mr. Goodrich We're all gonna drown with her MR. GOODRICH STOP! F... K ah What the f♪ck? F♪ck losing my god damn mind Asshole you gonna bring the end Where's Paul Your brother left here 20 minutes ago Is everything okay big boy? Which way did he go?
