"And so, the wicked witch told the little girl, Come with me. I will take you to a place where rainbows spring right up from the ground, where unicorns dance in the fields, where trees grow cupcakes, the flowers blossom with candy canes, and where it never rains. And there I will cast a spell on you so that can sleep here in happiness forever and ever." Seth? Boo! I got you. Seth, that's not funny. I know. It was hysterical. No, the only thing that's gonna be hysterical is how long you're grounded if I tell your mom you were running around past bedtime. To bed. Now. Oh, man, what a buzzkill. I miss Jamie. She was a cool babysitter. Hey, look. If you go to bed now, I'll make you chocolate-chip pancakes for breakfast. Really? Swear on my sorority. Sweet! Now, goodnight. Goodnight. Can you just hurry up, please? I've ordered pizza for us on Mrs. Gibson's credit card. So what? I haven't eaten all day. So, as far as I'm concerned, pizza is an emergency. What? Of course, I'm wearing clothes. What color are they? Well, I guess, if you don't hurry up, you may never find out. Yes. Make sure you come through the garage. They have those little cameras above the front and back doors. Okay. Hurry. Seth? Seth, you better not try to scare me with that ridiculous mask again. I swear, if you're down here, all you're getting tomorrow is leftover pizza crust. Hey. Everything okay? Claire, did you invite someone over this evening? No, of course not. I mean, I did order some pizza 'cause I was starving. He'll be dropping by soon in case you're still awake and... watching. No. Claire, I am asking because I am pretty sure I just saw someone peeking around the master's bedroom. Huh? I mean, at first, I thought it was you, but it looked like they were wearing one of Seth's mask. You weren't just playing with him just now, were you? No. Well, I mean, are you sure it wasn't Seth? He was wearing it earlier. I, uh, I guess it could be. But it, it looked like he's still in bed. Really? I mean, I can't see his face. So I can't say for sure. And he had stuffed his pillows under the sheets to fake us out. So, maybe... Oh. Well, I'm sure it's just him. I'll go check on them. Okay, thanks. And, Claire, please call me back immediately and let me know. Yeah, sure. Seth, did you take that mask and go into your sister's room wearing it? Seth, you better not be faking it. Must be the pizza guy. I really did try to fight a good fight here. Thanks. But, ultimately, it wasn't my call. The board disagrees. But they did say if the father presses charges, they will allow me to write a statement about your bedside manner here at the hospital. I'm sorry, I have a 12:30 appointment. You can leave your badge with Kaci. But take your time. All right? Daphne, if you ever need a recommendation... Thanks, Judith. Yeah. Hey, how'd it go? Just don't, Jeremy. Hey! Hey, hey. I did everything that I could. Except for telling them who's really responsible for what happened. Daphne... You know how long Mixer's been at this hospital. He's not going anywhere anytime soon. The board practically worships him. Yeah, well, now when everyone lets him get away with the crap he pulls, he won't. I told him you've never overlooked caring for a patient before. Not once. And what did you tell them about this time? Daph... it was your responsibility to check his vitals regardless of what Mixer had asked you to do. But I did tell them that you were just trying to do your job to the best of your ability regardless of what happened. Except, you didn't tell them he wasn't doing his. Oh, and by the way, remember on our second date when I said I knew I was gonna regret dating a physician's assistant? I was right. We're done. Daphne! Daphne! You know what? I'm gonna tell the board what I know about him and Kim in post op. Kaci, no. What? Don't do that. Why? It doesn't matter. And I honestly don't even think they'd care. So what? You're just gonna walk away from this without a fight? Daphne, come on, girl... Kaci, it doesn't matter. That little boy is gone forever. And regardless of who's at fault, I played a part in that. I know. I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Come here. It's okay. Daphne. Hey. I just want to say I heard what happened. I am so sorry. Oh, I bet you are. Excuse me, Ms. Washington, I was speaking with Nurse Hart. I know. Daphne, I really am sorry. They made the wrong call letting you go, you know? No one could've known. And who knows if it would've changed anything even if you had been there. Okay, I'm gonna stop you right there because somebody absolutely could have known. You just didn't care enough to. Mm-hm. But dad does wanna see her. There's not much I can do about that. Hey! Hey! Uh, Mom, look. Kaci just got here. So, can I call you tomorrow? I love you, too. Okay. Bye. Hi. So, I have some... ...fantastic news. Oh. Okay. I've got you covered, girl. What are you talking about? Dr. Burke had a friend stop by for a scrip yesterday. Oh, it was this gorgeous cosmetic surgeon that she went to medical school with and now she owns her own practice in Beverly Hills, but anyway... She has a kid, this cute little boy. And I heard her talk on the phone saying something about she needs a babysitter this weekend, last minute, and I kind of mentioned you. Mentioned me for what? To help babysit. Kaci, I'm not a babysitter. I need to focus on getting a real job right now, like, as soon as possible. Right, right. I know. But, look, this little boy has diabetes. Hold on. She wants to hire a nurse as a full-time babysitter? Isn't that kinda silly? Okay. I'm just sayin'. You know, it's not only $300 per day... but it's also a short-term gig. So, you know, just think about it, I guess. Three hundred a day? Three hundred a day. I guess the grandma used to help out with the kid, but, apparently, they are going to a wake in Sacramento this weekend. So, I guess it's kind of an emergency. Why isn't the kid going with them? Apparently, he's afraid of flying. I don't think I'm ready, Kaci. Ready for what? To be left responsible for another kid's life. After everything that happened, it's just not... Daphne, listen. You did nothing wrong. Okay? You were following doctor's orders. The wrong orders. Yeah. And you will never go against your better instincts again. Will you? No, of course not. Okay, then. So, who better to take care of that kid than the best children's nurse I have ever met in my life? Can I just think about it? And I'll get back to you tonight? Okay. Sure. Okay... I hope you're calling to tell me you changed your mind. Well, I didn't change my mind about making a bad call, but I do know that there's nothing I'd rather be doing than taking care of these kids. Mm. See, that's the spirit. Can you send me their info? Yeah, sure. Hopefully, they haven't found anyone else. Great. Thank you, Kaci, really. I'll text you right now. Okay. All right, bye. "818..." Hey, pretty girl. Hi... Oh, I know, I know. Don't cry. Don't cry. It's okay. It's okay. Hi. Shh. Come on. It's okay. Here we go. Here we go. Ah. Shh. Hey, Glenn. Um... Can you listen to the nursery for a minute? I gotta go to the ladies'. Of course. Okay, thanks. Hello? Thanks. No problem. Long night, huh? Mm, they always are. Hi. Hi. You must be Daphne Hart. Yes. I'm Karen Andrews. This is my son, Toby. Oh, hi, Toby, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Where did you say you live again? Ah, just up the way on Lankershim. Oh, nice. I used to live up here for a bit after I graduated med school. Where did you go to med school? Calumet. I'm sure you've never heard of it. Yeah, no, never heard of that. How about you? Um, I went to nursing school in Atlanta, 'cause that's where my family's from. Really? So, what brought you out here? A boy. But that is a quick and an eventful story. Um... Yeah, I should've stuck to med school, become a doctor like I had originally planned. It sounds more like a Cabernet story if you ask me. Yeah, probably. So, full disclosure. Um... Kaci, your friend, told me about what happened. So, I can only imagine what you're going through right now. But I also talked to my very dear long-time friend Shannon, who you probably know as Dr. Burke, and... Daphne, she had nothing but great things to say about you. Thank you. Yeah, it's been a tough week. It's been a tough week for me, too. I was nearly forced to fly on a plane. Oh. But things are looking up. I'm good with water. Thank you. Is that a birthday cake milkshake? Yup. That is my favorite. Really? Mine, too. Really? I assume that Kaci filled you in on everything. Yes, um, she told me that you guys were going out of town, and that Mr. Toby here has a pesky case of insulin fever. This is my cheat day. So the next six days are gonna be brutal. Do you have any other questions for me? Or for either of us? I don't think so. I think I just thought you would be interviewing me. So I didn't... Yeah. You know, Shannon told me everything I need to know. Well, actually, no... Yeah, uh... When are you coming back? We're gonna head back on Sunday evening. We should be back around 9:00. A-again, I'm sorry for your loss. Oh, yeah. Um, no, it's my aunt. She was my mother's sister. I haven't seen her in years. This is more so... support for my mother. But we were all kind of expecting it, right? She did send her Christmas gifts. That's right. Which is why someone needs to go and represent since this one is so afraid of flying. Yeah, why are you so afraid to fly? Things without wings weren't meant to fly. Oh. You know, that's actually a very good point. Honestly, I have never really been a fan of flying, either. Great. Then we have lots to talk about. Well, that is if she wants to take the job. Well, if you're sure you'll have me, um, I'd love to. Right. We're gonna have a lot of fun. And in other news, local authorities are still investigating the murder of 21-year-old Claire Carven, a SoCal student who was found dead Friday night in a home where she was babysitting for a family in Sherman Oaks. Carven, an exemplary student, and member of the Beta Sigma Eta sorority at her school, was reportedly deceased when officers arrived on the scene. Police are still searching for a delivery driver who was reportedly delivering a pizza at the time of the murder for questioning. What's up? What's going on? Hey! Come on in. Mi casa es su casa. Oh! Here, I'll take that. Oh, thank you. De Nada. Hi. Hi. Welcome, welcome! Thank you. Aw! Come this way. I'm gonna give you a dime tour. So, through here is the guest wing. It's where my mom stays when she's here. Okay. This is the sitting room. Through here is the kitchen. This is the living room, and down there is the home theater. Over here is the home study, and right around here is the upstairs den, and this is our room, and my husband David. David, this Daphne. Hey. How are you? Oh. Hi, nice to meet you. Likewise. This is a beautiful place you got here. Oh, that's all her doing. I'm just a tenant. Oh, stop it. So, of course, this is the backyard, the bar... And I hope you brought your bathing suit. Hey, Karen, can I ask you something? Yeah. Why me? I mean, I'm super grateful for the opportunity, but after everything you've heard, why me? So, about a year ago, I picked up Toby from school and he's acting, I don't know, weird. He's having a glass of milk. Next thing I know, he's puking it up. I assume he has a stomach bug, so I give him water to stay hydrated and an antacid to settle his stomach. A little while later, I put him to bed, and a couple hours after that, I wake up... to go check on him... and he's not better. He's, he's worse. And I just remember that, that sweet smell coming out of his pores. And that's when I knew he'd gone into ketoacidosis. Meaning he's diabetic. Yeah. He's my baby. He's my, he's my son. And I didn't even see the signs. It was an honest mistake. Honest mistakes happen. And I know from experience that when you are a good person who makes an honest mistake, you're never gonna make that kind of mistake again. And that is why I hired you. So, can I trust you with my son? Of course. Good. I mean, I guess. Right? Here, baby. I'll take that? Yeah. Oh, are you sure you're gonna be okay without us the whole weekend? Mom, I'll be fine. Are you sure you're gonna be okay without me for the whole weekend? I don't know. I don't know. Oh! I will guard him with my life. Promise. Thanks. Give me a hug, buddy. Hey, and if grandma calls the landline, just, uh, tell her we're already on our way. And don't you two have too much fun, okay? All right. We'll try not to. Oh, and there's a spare key on the counter. In case you guys need to leave for any reason, just please lock up. And we left cash on the credenza if you wanna order take-out or anything. Pizza? I could go for some pizza. Thin crust, buddy. All right? And no computer after 8:00 p.m. You follow me? Loud and clear. Love you. Love you, too. Love you. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Drive safe. Ooh. Yeah, but... Ah! Pizza's here. I-I'll get it. I don't have to worry about you cheating, do I? Do I look like I need to cheat to win this game? Okay, Toby, we'll see. And what was that? What just happened here? Yeah, that's right. What happened? You think I can't play checkers. Mrs. Andrews? No, I-I'm the babysitter. Parents out of town? N-no, uh, they will be back any minute now. That'll be $16.56. Here you go. Keep the change. You sure? Yeah, I'm sure. Thanks. Toby, you scared me. Pepperoni and floor shine. Tasty. I'm sorry. What kinda pizza man doesn't drive a delivery car? Toby? Hey, Toby. Come on. Let's get you to bed. Hm? Come on. Come on. All right. Come here. Can I help you? Um, I-I feel bad so I came back. Um, you gave me $40 by accident. And that's, uh, way too much for a pizza. No, I-I, I gave you a $20. No, see? $40. Well, the people that I'm sitting for paid for it. So, I-I'll just pay them back. It's fine. It's on me. That's nice. Shouldn't they be back already? They are. I don't see any extra cars. Yeah, they, uh, they had to take a lift in. 'Cause their car's getting repaired. So they can't get it till tomorrow. But if they're back, what are you still doing? I am staying until they get their car tomorrow. And, you know, we were actually all heading to bed. So... Do you wanna go out sometime? Actually, I have a boyfriend. But thank you. Goodnight. It's a shame. You're really pretty. Thank you. It's very nice of you. Um, but I, I should really get the kid to bed. 'Course you do. Hey. If that boyfriend of yours ever screws up, think of me, will you? Sure. You got it. Night. You're up late. Okay. I'm kinda freaking out. What's goin' on? Well, there was this pizza guy here earlier and, I don't know, he was just really creeping me out. And-and he left and then he came back and said that I overpaid him. Well, did you? I don't know. Maybe. But... Okay, he was gone for a really long time and-and then he came back and was... He-he was knocking on the door and then he just started asking me all sorts of weird stuff. Oh! Like, "Do you want anchovies on your tombstone?" or... Kaci, I'm serious. What's goin' on? Hold on. Just, like, where his parents were and stuff. Then I just looked out on the backyard and there are footprints on the deck from the wet lawn. So what? Girl, it's a big house, right? He probably just went around the back because you didn't answer the first time he tried. Maybe. I don't know. Look, if you're that freaked out why don't you just call the cops and file a report? Well, because I don't wanna get him in trouble in case I'm overreacting. Well, look, I get off in an hour. Do you want me to come over? No, it's okay. I don't wanna spook Toby. He's already asleep. I'm sure I'm fine. I know you are, too. But, hey, if anything else happens, you call me, all right? Yeah. Okay, I love you. Take care, okay? Daphne. My mom's on the phone for you. Coming. Okay. Hey, Karen. Hi! How's it going over there? I gave him his shots this morning and now he's just doing the dishes. Oh, that's so good to hear. Well, we're about to head up to the funeral and the wake and it's in Wine Country, so, we might fall off the grid for a little while. Yeah, uh, that shouldn't be a problem. I'm sure we'll be fine. Better than fine, Mom. What'd we agree on the other day? That you're a big boy and you can mostly take care of yourself. Glad you remembered. Okay, well just don't have so much fun that you forget... To administer my insulin shot again before dinner. Duh. Yeah, he was only a little squirmy this morning. So, hopefully, he's better tonight. Oh! I did not. Okay. Well... Maybe a little. I will call you crazy kids later this evening. All right. Thanks, Karen. Bye. Bye. Toby, you doin' okay up there? Yeah. Toby? Toby? 9-1-1. What's your emergency? Hi, um, my name is Daphne Hart. I think there might be somebody in the house that I'm babysitting at. What is the address of the residence? It's, um, 1126 Aspendale. Are you aware of anyone else in the house? Uh, just the kid that I'm babysitting and he's sleeping upstairs which is where I am now. Okay, ma'am, uh, please sit tight and we'll send dispatch in the area to check things out. Okay. Thank you. Oh, jeez. I-I-I'm sorry. It's just... You scared me. Oh, you scared me, too. I-I'm Daphne. I'm the babysitter for the Andrews. I thought the Andrews were out of town. Yeah, they are. Well, everybody except Toby. So, I'm, I'm watching him. And you are? I'm sorry. I'm Audra Simonetti. I work for the maid services. Okay. Yeah, no. That makes sense. Uh, sorry, it's just, nobody told me that anybody was coming by. Our schedule, Gloria, told me that no one would be here so I didn't even think to call beforehand. Oh, no, no, no. It's, it's totally fine. I'm... It's just me and Toby. I mean, he was gonna go, but... Anyway, he's upstairs, napping. Have you been here before? No. I mean, I-I-I've worked in this neighborhood before but this is my first time cleaning for this home. It is a nice place. Yeah, it is. Well, they all are, here in Toluca Lake. Oh, I used to wanna live here so bad. Hmm. Oh, thank you. Whereabouts do you live? Um, I'm just ten minutes away right off of Ventura and Studio City. I live by the village, just past the 170. Mm, yeah, I used to work over there. What'd you do? I'm, uh, a nurse. Oh, that is a tough job. I commend you. What brought you here? I was, um, recently laid off, actually. Oh, that's too bad. What brought you into babysitting? Well, I needed the work and, um, Toby's diabetic so I think Mrs. Andrews just felt more comfortable having a nurse around the house, you know. I'd feel the same way if it were my child. Do you have kids? I used to work at the pediatrics department in my old job. Sadly, I do not. Oh. Well, it's never too late, right? For me, it is. So, are you, uh, single? Uh, as of recently, yeah. What happened? He was just insanely selfish and... not the great guy I thought he was at the end of the day, unfortunately. So, how about you? Do you want kids? I do, yeah. Eventually. I feel like I still have a lot of growing up to do. Hm. Well, you'll find your way. You're still young and gorgeous. You have your entire life ahead of you. Thanks. It just doesn't feel like that right now. Well, it doesn't matter what you feel. All that matters is what is. Yeah. I guess you're right. Oh, who could that be? Oh. Um... I called 9-1-1. I-I didn't know who you were. That, that's probably them. Let me just go deal with them. I'll be right back. Wow, you really were spooked. Hi. Yeah, we received a call from you. Yeah, I'm sorry. That was just a misunderstanding. I heard a noise so I called you guys. But I realized it was just the maid. Are you Daphne Hart? Yeah, I'm the babysitter. And you don't have any, um, reason you might want me to look around and check things out? I mean, you're welcome to check things out but I am okay. Okay. Um... How about I just take a look around make sure everything looks okay. No break-ins. Hm? Okay, yeah. You let me know if you need me, okay? Yeah. Thank you. Oh! Oh! Uh... Sorry. We have got to stop doing this. Yeah. So, is everything all right now? Oh, yeah. No, everything's fine. Still, you can never be too careful. I assume you heard about that poor girl on the news the other night. I did. That's so scary. It's just awful what people will do to other people these days, isn't it? Yeah. I guess it's a good thing they got here so quick just in case it had been a real emergency. I think he just felt better if he could check things out. Probably wanting to check you out, no doubt. Well, on to the next. I'm finished, so I'll be leaving. Okay. Oh, wait. Do you get a tip or something? I, I might have some cash... Oh, please, no. I'm, I'm fine. But thank you. You've done enough already. Really? What did I do? You kept me company for a little while. It was nice talking to you, Daphne. Yeah, it was nice talking to you, too. Bye. Bye. Hey, Tobs. Hey. Mind if I join you? Oh, sure. Did you have a good nap? Yeah. Sometimes I get a little tired after I'm in the sun for too long. Makes sense. It's a pretty cool fort you got going on. Thanks. You got walkies? Yeah. They don't get much use being an only child and all, but, mm. Right. So, what are you working on? Do I get to find out now? Okay, fine. But it's a surprise for my mom and dad. So you have to promise you won't say anything. Okay. Promise? I promise. Okay, fine. Pinky promise. There you go. Okay. So this here looks like an ordinary bird house. But really, it's a yard monitoring system. A yard monitoring system? Yup. See, up here you can put bird feeder to feed the birds. Uh-huh. Yeah. Obviously. But down here, there's a hidden compartment to put a camera. So you can see, like, visitors and burglars and stuff. Visitors and burglars? Yeah, I mean, my parents have a lot of expensive junk so I gotta protect it. I see. Well, it seems like you got a pretty solid no home invasion plan here. I-I do. Now I just need my dad to get a mini-camera and, bam! Yard monitoring system installed for a steal-of-a-price on a normal one. Wow, I'm impressed. Thank you. You know, I bet you're gonna make a lotta money off all these creative endeavors one day. That's the plan. But if I can help people while doing it, it's a win-win. Just don't tell anyone I'm soft. Oh, no. Our little secret. Yeah, yeah. Promise. Pinky promise. Yeah. There you go. Yeah, there we go. There we go. Uh, I'm hungry. Yeah, you wanna go eat? Yeah. All right. Let's go. Let's go. Okay. Yeah. What do you want for dinner? Uh... I don't even know what we have. Okay. Uh, how about I check out and see what we gotta work with, you go grab your shot, we'll get that ready so we can get it out of the way, and I will make us something yummy. How does that sound? All right. Hey, I should probably call my mom too before it gets too late, right? Yes, good idea. Huh. Where did I put my phone? Uh, Toby, I'll be right back. I think I left my phone upstairs. Okay. Jeremy? Jeremy? Oh! Je-Jeremy! What are you doing here? You're trespassing, by the way. You wouldn't respond to any of my texts. What was I supposed to do? How did you even find out where I was anyway? Dr. Burkes spilled the beans at work tonight. Her friend hired you. And did you take that as an open invitation to break into a property unannounced? Daphne, this is the only way I can get you to talk to me. You need to leave. Daphne, come on. I don't want to talk to you, Jeremy. And even if I did, you really wouldn't like what I had to say. How about you try me? I told you, we're done. I meant that. You're gonna throw away a year of us going out over this one stupid thing that happened? Stupid? Not only did I lose my job, I lost my dignity. And a child lost their life. That's anything but stupid, don't you think? I'll tell the board what Dr. Mixer did. Okay? I'll tell them that he asked you to get his cup of coffee and that he offered to watch your patients while you were gone and then he totally failed. I mean, maybe you'll get your job back. Daph, look, I-I-I feel terrible and I just wanna fix this for you. And for us. This isn't just about a job, Jeremy. Dr. Mixer failed, yeah. But so did I. Those people that we're responsible for, their lives are in our hands every second of every hour of every day. So I deserve what happened to me. And you and I just can't go back to the way things were. Pretending that we don't need to be held accountable for the roles that we played in the death of that little boy. Just leave me alone, Jeremy. Please. Who was that? Just my ex. He's gone. Don't worry about it. Yeah... Oh, come on. Is he still out there? No, he left. Okay, let's do this. Okay. Let's see how this goes. Okay. Yeah. Good? Here we go. Doesn't hurt? I'm used to it. A little. Hey, Toby, have you seen my phone? No, where'd you last see it? I thought I left it in here and now I can't find it. Maybe you left it out by the pool or up in my room. Yeah, maybe. Can you go check upstairs and I'll go check by the pool? Yeah. Thanks. Hey. You didn't find it? No, I even checked your room. Huh. Let me call from the landline. One sec. Okay. There's no dial tone. That's weird. Oh. Wait, no, no, no. Toby, hold on. All right. Get behind me. Come here. Kaci, thank God. Oh, wow. Is babysitting that boring? Oh, you must be Toby Andrews. Yeah. Yeah. Toby, this is Kaci, my best friend. We worked at the hospital together. She works with Dr. Burke. Cool. Shannon's great. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Cute kid. Y'all want some Chinese? You are now officially my favorite person. Welcome to our home. Hey, Kaci, didn't you have a date tonight? Girl, you know how these dating apps go. He looked nothing like his picture, okay. And he kept going on and on about this album that he's producing. Like, I mean, on and on and on. So I had to cut the drink short. And by cutting the drink short, I mean having wine and telling him I had to go. Okay? So I, um, I take it there won't be a second date? No. Wait, wait, why don't you just do it the old-fashioned way and go to a bar to meet a guy? Well, see, I mostly work overnights. So when I have a night off the last thing I wanna do is meet some guy at a bar. Plus, everyone knows I'm a lightweight. Mm-hmm. You shouldn't have a problem meeting a guy. You're too pretty. Aw! You see, now that makes you my favorite person in the world, kid. So maybe you're just too picky. I told you he was a smart kid. Okay, you know what? So, um, how come you never texted me back when I told you I was on my way over here? It's the weirdest thing. I cannot find my phone. Yeah, we looked everywhere. Well, is your ringer on? I'll just call it. Here. Would you, please. The phone here is not working. That's weird, it went straight to voicemail. Seriously? Yeah. My phone was fully charged this afternoon. I barely used it all day. Yeah. Where else could it have been? Hey, Toby, do you know where your mom would keep the number to the cleaning service? I'm sure the maid just probably moved it when she was cleaning the counters. Maid? What maid? The maid that was here while you were taking a nap. We don't have a maid. You don't have a cleaning service that comes on Saturdays? The maid probably comes once a week while you're at school. Oh, no, no, no. Not a chance. My grandma always wants something to do after she picks me up from school. She'll cook and clean and sometimes do the laundry which just drives my mom crazy. Yeah, but this woman had a maid's uniform and she had her own cleaning supplies. Okay, now I'm freaked out. No, no, no, um, I'm sure your mom just hired a maid for the weekend because they're out of town. Right, right. Girl, I'm sure that's it. Okay? Yeah. Maybe. Hey, you wanna stay and watch a movie? Well, if I have any more of this wine, I may not have a choice. All right, how about you go upstairs, take a bath, get ready for bed, and then we'll pick out a movie to watch, yeah? Sweet. Okay. Hey, are you all right? You seem kind of spooked the whole time we were eating dinner. Yeah, no. I was just thinking. Did you hear about the girl who was murdered last Friday on the news? What? No. Yeah. She was babysitting in Sherman Oaks. That's not far from here. No, I know. And I just remembered they said they suspected it was the pizza delivery guy. What if it's the same guy? Come on. If he really murdered someone last week, you really think he's still delivering some damn pizzas. Well, he wasn't driving a delivery car. What if it's a local joint? Sometimes they don't have delivery cars. Look, do you want me to crash after the movie? I don't have spin class until 2:30 tomorrow, girl. You wouldn't mind? Not at all. Okay, yeah. That would actually make me feel a lot better. I got you, girl. Thank you. So, do you really think the maid took your phone? Well, I didn'that first because she was so sweet in person. Look, why don't you just call Toby's mom and ask her? No, no, I don't wanna do that. I don't wanna get them freaked out over nothing. I mean, they trusted me with their child after they found out everything that happened. The last thing that I want is for them to think I'm some crazy girl accusing their maid of stealing. Okay, well, who else could have done it? I mean, I don't know, the only people up here besides us has been Jeremy, but he was outside the whole time. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold up. Rewind. Jeremy was here? Yes, he came by earlier. What? Well, he talked to Dr. Burke who told him where I was so he came over and jumped the fence. Oh, my God. I cannot believe the nerve-of that boy. Ugh! Now, hold on. The gate was closed earlier when Jeremy was here. Huh. And the gate was open when I arrived. Well, there you have it. Jeremy never left. Mm-mm. He probably just figured out a way to open your gate and now he messing with you. Girl, he's probably the one who stole your phone. No. That doesn't even sound like something Jeremy would do. My exes have done way worse. Especially when they're used to getting what they want. And when's the last time Jeremy's heard anyone say no? Call him. Go ahead. No. Uh, no, I don't wanna do that either. At least not until I get to talk to the maid service and see if, I don't know, maybe she picked it up thinking it was hers. Okay, fine. You got anything I can wear? Yeah. It's upstairs. It's the last room in the left hallway. My bag's on the bed so just take whatever you want. Okay, cool. I will. Thanks, Kaci. Love you. Love you. Okay. Take one of my walkies. Oh, are you scared? Oh, no, no, no. It's, um... It's for you, in case you get scared. Thanks, kid. All right. Ah... Goodnight. Goodnight. Oh, shoot. We didn't close the gate. Crap. Oh, wait, let me get my phone. We can use the flashlight. Okay. Who closed the gate? Daphne. What? My phone is gone. What? What do you mean? Yo, Daphne... My phone was right here. I left it right here. I know it. Are you 100 percent sure? Yes, I'm a hundred percent sure. I mean, I had a couple of glasses of wine but I'm pretty sure. Oh, my God. What? The spare keys are gone. What? Don't play with me, girl. It has been there the entire time since the Andrews left. The whole time? Uh-huh. Who the hell is that? I never thought I'd say this but I really hope that's Jeremy. There's no one there. That's because somebody is screwing with us. That's why. Are all doors locked? Hold on, hold on. I have an idea. I'll be right back. What? What are you doing? Just hold on. Hold on. Hurry up! Okay. Close it, close it, close it. Girl! What you gonna do with that? You'll see. You'll see. Okay. Oh! Okay. Okay. Now we have our alarm. Okay. Okay, we have to barricade all the doors and make sure that all the windows are locked. Okay. Okay, okay, okay. Okay. Don't creep up on me like that. Jesus! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Look, I found another door in the other wing. Okay, what did you do? I nailed it shut. Okay, yeah, that works. Okay. Uh, so... what do we do now? Um... Oh, Jeremy! Ooh! It is too cold for this crap. Come on, Jeremy. If this is some sick way of trying to get me back, you could just give us back our cellphones and get the hell out of here. Is he dead? Is he dead? Oh, my God! Oh, no! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Let's go out the back door. No, we tied it, remember? That way, that way. What do we do? Come on. Who the hell was that? I don't know. He, he killed Jeremy. Do you think he was the creepy pizza guy? I mean, damn, did you leave a tip? Toby, get down here! No, we need to use this thing. And block all the doors, okay? No, we need to get Toby. We need to get out of here right now. What? You wanna go out there where he's at? Oh, hell no. If he wants to, he can come back in, Kaci. We cannot stay here. Do you understand? Okay. Fine. I'mma go get my keys in the purse in the kitchen. Okay. All right. I'll get Toby. Toby? Toby? Toby? Toby? Toby, Shh. I need you to not make one noise, okay? Okay? Okay. Come here, come here, come here. We gotta hide. Come here. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Get down, get down. No, no, right here, right here. Shoot! Ah! Ah! The best you got, huh? Come on. Hey! No. Toby, we can't stay here, okay? We gotta find a way out of here, okay? Okay. Follow me, all right? All right. Stay close. Come on. Up, up, up, up, up. Quiet. Quiet. Shut it, shut it, shut it. Okay. Okay. Toby, do your parents have a gun? We are in Toluca Lake. What do you think? Didn't you say he had a knife? Yeah. Okay, Toby, is there another way down besides the front staircase? Um, uh... I-I have a fire ladder in my room, but I can't go down. I only practiced one time and I freaked out. No, no, no, no. It's okay. I'm gonna be with you the entire time, okay? We're just gonna figure out a way to get back to your room, okay? Okay. I need you to go into the bathroom closet, close the door and talk into the walkie, protect your voice. No, no, no, I can't, I can't... Listen, listen, listen. Listen to me, Toby, the other walkie is in my room. If he hears that, maybe he'll go there instead, okay? I don't want you to leave me. Toby, I will never leave you. I promise. You can do it. You can do it. He's coming for us. We have to hide! Toby, Toby, Toby, come here. It worked. Good job, okay? Now, once he figures out that we're not in there he's gonna come back here, so we gotta be quick and we gotta be quiet. Are you ready? You can do it. You can do it. Okay. All right. Wait, wait. Okay. Go. Is that the ladder? Okay. All right. Come on. Here. I got it. I got it. Go, go, go, go, go, go. Be careful. Quickly. Quickly. Careful. Careful. Okay, come on. Come on, come on. You got it? Okay. Here. Take this. Okay, come on, come on. Okay, let's go. Let's go. Ho! Shhh. Okay, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Okay. You're gonna get on the ladder first. Then I'm gonna go right behind you, okay? I can't, I can't, I can't do it. What? What? Toby? Toby? Yes, you can. Listen to me. I have staff kids coming to the hospital who are hurt, who are injured, and you are so much braver than any of them, okay? Hey, look. All right? I'm gonna be with you every step of the way, all right? I'm gonna walk you through it. You're gonna get on that ladder and we're gonna go step by step together. Okay? Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Listen. I promised your mother that I wasn't gonna let anything happen to you. And I meant that. Okay? I got you. I'll take care of you, okay? We got this. Yeah? Yeah? Okay. Okay. Toby, are you okay? I-I don't feel very good. You're getting hypoglycemic. Okay. Okay. It's all right. Do you think you can make it down the ladder without fainting? Yeah? I think so. You need to be strong, Toby, okay? Okay. You can do this, all right? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. I got you. I got you. All right, all right. We're gonna go step by step. Yeah. Okay. Step down. Come on. Yeah. There you go. There you go. Hold it tightly. Come on. I got you. I got you. Okay. One more step. Okay. Easy. Easy. Okay? Step down. Come on down. Okay. Okay. All right. Little to the left. Okay. Come on. Careful. All right. Come on. Over here. Over here. Come on. Okay. Okay. Kaci car. Kaci car. Come on. Okay. All right. Get in. Get in. Okay. Stay right here. I'll be right back. I have to get the keys. Okay. Kaci? Kaci? Kaci? Kaci? Kaci? Kaci? K-Kaci? Kaci, I'm so sorry! Karen? Daphne. Why haven't you been answering my calls? I've been calling you since... Karen. Karen, listen to me. We were attacked. What? Toby is fine. But I need to get him his insulin shot, okay? I need you to call the police. What, what do you mean "attacked?" Karen, I have to get back to the car but two people are already dead. The killer's... Karen, call the police. Now. I have to go. They're never gonna make it on time. Audra? Audra Monrose. You're his mother. Go on. You can say his name. Say his name! Mason. I thought his mother was... You thought I was dead. Well, that's what his father tells everyone. Only because he wishes I were dead. What do you mean? Well, it's simple. My son was taken from me twice. Once, from my ex-husband, and now from all of you. Mason's dad was a sweetheart. I used to think so, too until I found him messing around with a babysitter one night when I came home early. Perhaps, you've heard of her. Her name is Claire Carven. Well... it was. The babysitter from the news. Yeah. Everyone thought she was so sweet and so perfect, just like everyone mistakenly thought of you. No. Audra, listen to me. I need you to understand I am not responsible for the death of your son. Okay? I was asked to do something by my superior. And your son's vitals were fine the last I checked on him, I promise. You don't believe it was your duty whatsoever to make sure my son was okay even though you were the nurse on duty the night he died? I am so sorry for the loss of your son. And if I had known that my boss was gonna step away from the monitor when he did, I would have never left my post, okay? I never intended for any of that to happen to your son, I promise. Well, I never intended on trying to poison my husband after he cheated on me. But... we all have to reap the consequences of the actions we take every day nonetheless. Now, don't we? Oh, God! Audra! Audra, please. I know how much you must've loved your son, Mason, but do you really think this is what he would've wanted his mother to become? You have no idea what my son would've wanted. And you have no clue how much I loved him. But you will now. You should never be responsible for taking care of another child ever! Yeah? Well, neither should you. Toby? Toby? Okay. Stay with me. Do you hear me? Do you hear me? Okay. All right. I got you. I got you right here, Toby. Okay. Okay. All right. All right. Okay. Yeah? Yeah? What took you so long? Okay. All right. Let's get you out of here. Okay. All right. Daphne, behind you! Ah! Daphne! Ah! No. No. No! Daphne! I only wanted to protect my son. And you took that away from me! Are you okay? Oh! Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay. Yeah. I'm okay. Daphne! Hey, kid! Oh! Check it out. Is that the monitoring system? Yup. That's incredible! You're in business, kid. Bet your parents paid a pretty penny for that cool new security system. We paid for the materials. Oh. And I'm sure someday we'll be paying for this one's first business startup. How are you? I'm good. Are you all packed up? Yeah, I'm gonna head out in about an hour. Well, Los Angeles is losing one of its finest nurses. Well, hopefully Atlanta feels the same way about gaining one. You're not gonna be a nurse for much longer, are you? You know you always have a place to stay when you come visit. In case, perhaps, you decide to do residency here even. Thank you, Karen. It's very sweet of you. Well, I-I mean, do you have to leave now? We ordered lunch. And it'd be really nice if you could stay. Yeah, I think I could stick around. Great. Come on. Also, today is my cheat day. So we got milkshakes, too. Birthday cake milkshakes? Duh. Y-you know, it's a real bummer you're leaving. Maybe someday if I'm not too afraid of flying, I'll come visit. I'd love that. And, hey, it seems like you're already halfway there. There's a big difference between a second story and a flight's maximum height. Either way, I'll be back some day. Do you think by the time you get back we'd be too old for birthday cake milkshakes? Toby, one can never be too old for birthday cake milkshakes. ♪ Keep keep movin' up ♪ ♪ Take a chance before it's gone ♪ ♪ If the world is hard to climb ♪ ♪ It doesn't mean you shouldn't try ♪ ♪ You can make it on your own ♪ ♪ Though at times you feel alone ♪ ♪ Along the ride ♪ ♪ It's the risk you take ♪ ♪ Being alive ♪ ♪ I know how you're feeling ♪ ♪ 'Cause I felt it all before ♪ ♪ The silent storm of desperation ♪ ♪ Knocking at your door ♪ ♪ Let me tell you something ♪ ♪ When the clouds have all gone by ♪ ♪ The brighter days are waiting for you ♪ ♪ On the other side ♪ ♪ Chances are you'll still fall over ♪ ♪ Searching for your four-leaf clover ♪ ♪ First step's the hardest anyway ♪ ♪ Don't look back you're only wasting ♪ ♪ Precious time we could be chasing ♪ ♪ Everything we haven't found ♪ ♪ One day it will come around ♪ ♪ Gotta keep keep movin' up ♪ ♪ Take a chance before it's gone ♪ ♪ If the world is hard to climb ♪ ♪ It doesn't mean you shouldn't try ♪ ♪ You can make it on your own ♪ ♪ Though at times you'll feel alone ♪ ♪ Along the ride ♪ ♪ It's the risk you take ♪ ♪ Being alive ♪ ♪ Aa aa aa aah aah ♪ ♪ Aa aa aa aa aa aa aah ♪ ♪ Aa aa aa ♪ ♪ Being alive ♪ ♪ Aa aa aah ♪
