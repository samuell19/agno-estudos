To see this movie is recommended turn off the lights and put headphones on. I'm sure you've all heard about The Slit Mouthed Woman by now. But how many of you really know what she's really like? I wonder how many of you have ever heard of it Ah, the bus is gone Miss! The bus has already gone. Miss... The bus has already gone. Miss! Reserved things disappear and are hated by people... Forgotten and faded from memory before you know it. That's the rule. I'm not trying to get rid of it. I'm just waiting for the bus that never comes. Woman's heart The Slit Mouthed Woman Excuse me... Do you remember the legend of "The Slit Mouthed Woman"? It was quite popular a while ago. Right around the time I was in elementary school. There was a narrow, dark street behind the school... And she was there standing like this... I was scared and ran away when I saw this pretty lady with a mask. But she chased me with a big knife at a great speed, like 100m in 5 seconds! I remember... But I don't remember how old I was. I used to go home with my friends. I was in the first grade of junior high school, and I had a scary thought... About what I would do if I met her on the street at night. I remember it, but it was so stupid, it wasn't real... So it doesn't matter if I remember it or not I don't remember... This is how the legend of The Slit Mouthed Woman started. Souichiro, the only son of the president of Ozawa Trading, was working in his office. He was beautiful and had a good job. I'd like to live like that if I could. He's so cute! He's the oldest and is living alone. He'll will turn 23. As you ladies know, when the makeup is not done right, it's a very frustrating thing. Every woman wants to be beautiful. But in this woman's case... I'm afraid it was a little extreme. She shouldn't go on like this. She hated to lose more than anyone else... and she was a rare combination of talent and pride. Saeko came to Tokyo with dreams of success, and her parents had high expectations of her. That's why she worked so hard.... Saeko knew she couldn't lose in both work and love. She tried her best... But in Tokyo there are many people with her beauty and talent. She was like a frog in a well. And then the lies started... Perhaps it was her own ambition. You're really serious. But work alone is a waste. You should be more beautiful and enjoy life. I bet you could be a lot more beautiful with a little work. I know a guy who runs a hospital, so don't worry, it's just like a beauty treatment. I'd be happy to marry you if you're beautiful. Saeko had come to believe... That the son of the boss whom she admired so much would be interested in her. Hi, it's Ohtawara. Who do you think you're working for? Pay the debt... and operate on her. You're so full of shit, aren't you? She was hospitalized. Her face wrapped in bandages... Saeko was lying in bed with bandages wrapped around her face. And on her bedside was pamphlets with information about weddings and travel. How do you feel? "Am I beautiful?" You were beautiful to begin with. There was no need for surgery. She wrote this out repeatedly. But it was itchy... Between the bandages and the skin. Their skin was very itchy She woke up and for some reason... She couldn't speak. No, stop! This isn't supposed to happen. Look at your face in the mirror... She took off the bandages And when it come off... I remember there was a rumor that if a woman wearing a mask... Ask you if she is beautiful, and you said she is, she will kill you I've never heard anything... About people saying she's pretty. In the elevator at Ozawa Trading Company... Shoichiro and a young female employee were together. And they were hugging and kissing. But you're dating Ms. Saeko... Don't be idiot She's so annoying Saeko emerged from the darkness. And she was using a mask. And then that figure faded into the deepest darkness. Am i beautiful? Delicious Isn't it? It's full of your favorite things, Yoshimatsu. Mom! This don't taste good at all! I put all my favorite things in it. I see... don't taste good because I didn't put my favorite thing. No... Mom! In addition to the previous story about the slit-mouthed woman... There are many other ghost stories about women's grudges. Beware, ladies and gentlemen. The man's name was Takashi Kawano... A handsome and modern man who grew up in Tokyo. The woman's name was Sekine Shibori. She was a local girl with a very respectable family and was very well educated. But its capacity was below expectations... This man and woman's relationship was decided by their parents. And the misfortune was just starting. Turns out Takashi had another woman Unlike the woman he was exploring... She was a pretty and had a beautiful mouth But he fell in love with her... and now the Sekine was in the way. Sekino was well educated and came from a good family... But Takashi wasn't a good person and he found a solution to the situation He didn't love Sekino. The more Takashi fell in love with Terumi, his lover... The more he hated Sekino. And when she started hating Takashi and Terumi... he developed a grudge against her. I wonder... What kind of stories will come out of the love between people... in the future Takashi finally get rid of his wife It wasn't the first time the police had seen something like this. Takashi had a plan and he thought he'd done it perfectly But even though he killed the body... He couldn't kill the spirit. Pick it up, please! What's wrong? Okay, I'll explain the project to you. The headline is: "A Night in the Desert, Another American Dream" and the location is here in Nevada. The theme of this project is to take you to a wonderful resort hotel that is far from the image of a desert... Since he killed his wife, slugs have been appearing everywhere her soul goes. In fact, it might be better to call it a hallucinations with slugs. Because the slugs... The slugs were completely invisible to everyone except for Takashi. It's a strange story. He went to the doctor, checked out psychology books, but he couldn't figure out what was causing it. Takashi was helpless... And these slugs were appearing everywhere. It just won't stop. Thank you f it was just one or two of these slugs... It wouldn't matter But they keep appearing everywhere he goes. As expected, Takashi was disturbed by the slugs... And would make a big fuss about the invisible beings. This made everyone around him wonder... If he went crazy The slugs continued to appear to Takashi... And their numbers just kept growing... He couldn't tell if he was sane or going insane. He couldn't go to the office, he couldn't go to the doctor. So naturally... Takashi shuts himself away in his room. He ran out of the room There was only one place he could go... To his lover Terumi. What's wrong? You said you couldn't see me because you were sick. Do you want some rice? You're going to eat. Wait here for a minute. [I just made it. Taste good? What's the matter?! You made me eat this shit! Takashi! What's wrong? It's over I've lost my mind! It's okay, now i'm with you. I'm not leaving you. Takashi was walking in what looked like the underworld... And a woman was standing next to him. The clothes were from Terumi And when he looked at her face... It was the exact face Takashi saw when he committed the murder. I'm home! You're late, where have you been? I picked up this cute little baby... And I'd like to bring him home We can't keep it. Go ahead, throw it away. Alright... It's probably just a dog... But i can't do anything. Bye, bye. Bye, bye... Children sometimes do things we wouldn't expect They're cute, I guess. But... Sometimes they can be a little creepy... Because you don't know what they're thinking. Mom, let's go somewhere! Not now... let's go somewhere let's go have fun! Maybe later. This kid's family was him and his single mom. That's why he was bullied by the other children. His mother, who used to be his best friend... Hasn't been giving him much attention lately. Because she was expecting a baby... Despite the fact that she was a single mother. That's how complicated the situation was. This 10-year-old boy has no idea what's going on. But... He sensed that his mother was losing interest in him. No matter what I buy to you, you always let it die. He wanted a friend... It would have been best if he had human friends... But he was bullied, so that didn't work out. So he bought all kinds of creatures... And he let them all die. Partly because he wanted to get rid of the frustration of being bullied by other kids. But mostly for wanting his mother's attention An animal can't replace a mother. They can't take the place of a mother. He screamed like this... When he killed them. Well, your mom's going into the hospital next week... So you'll have to be on your own... You're a big boy, aren't you? Hi! I'll be at the hospital next week. Well, I told him... Yes... He's going to the institute. I'll think about it. What are you doing? It's late. Go to sleep. Do you have any pesticides? My mother's sick,so I have to do it in the garden Okay, 500 yen. Thank you. "If I could only get rid of the baby"... He thought. And... "Younger sister" what's wrong with you? The mother didn't come back to the boy... In fact, she went far away. His mother had lost her mind... And no one would approach him. The boy was really left all alone. Mom, the baby is gone. I've told you some modern ghost stories... Thank you very much for your time. I have a feeling I'll see you again very soon. Subs: Fernando Menegatti
