Only that, they can continue. Maybe before we take these readings We should send the brain scan of the second Regarding your question, On creating a perfect soldier An individual who can Have a great physical capacity for much longer Yes To withstand heavy tasks for longer This is that experiment. Stimulating that area of ​​the brain With a specific signal -I already gave the order -They just did it Very well we will continue later Volunteer are you ready?

Beware I have known them for quite some time -Your comrades -yes I know Maxim, the one with the glasses More than 10 years ago How old are you? -26 -You're young -maturity is approaching If only we had 26 How they fuck with their parties They seem to do it on purpose You have to give them a damn sedative. And put them in the vodka so they fall asleep. Listens We dope them with their vodka and when they fall asleep They go to sleep as usual and doped with vodka already asleep We take off their clothes and we left them in the hall No, and how about a laxative? If we give them a laxative? And they burst the bathroom? They don't need to bust it We empty the water tank No no no While one is shitting the one outside is desperate One minute after the first it's exploding again One shitting And the other desperate You imagine I think better laxatives Some are too old for sedatives they can die Imagine we kill the teachers Who did it?

Let's go Ah what a dog From time to time I have to separate them -He kicked him with everything in his legs Check it out The high maximum type always slides What are those? They are just sticks Nerd. He is doing dagger movements Yes, as a knife. Hello Hello Hello Good morning Hello Take a seat comrades My name is azhippo I am the director of the Institute Newly appointed director Although I've been involved for a long time in the work that is done here I have dedicated myself to work in state security I guess you already heard some of that Recently the Institute Has been investigating Super abilities of humanity Capable and super-capable men Influencing these skills Developing them, And forming these super skills, We could say that we are forming to the super human You are that group. They are not here by chance There was a thorough selection process Based on your individual qualities. Some of you would like ... Tell me what your vision is of contemporary society If we don't influence it radically, What will this society become? Well that's what I'm trying And I would like to give my point of view -Please I believe that the big mistake of this society Is that they do not understand The idea of ​​freedom Right now freedom it is poorly conceived I mean, anyone feels on freedom to get drunk Degrade instead, to develop One could work in a factory get drunk at night In essence that is today A member of society, yeah and also with children to raise Society has some future Does it stay that way? Well if we don't make a change there's no future There is absolutely no no future I don't think you should have the freedom to degenerate That is if someone does not want to develop we have to tell him Hey what's wrong Get to study something Join some sport In this case it would be better Not using a legislative approach Rather use propaganda With the influence of the media, films, laws In the family, school and work Sorry to interrupt you I expected that answer from you The society. In fact it is degenerating Something similar is happening in high school There is alcoholism, sexual immorality Lack of faith, in a better future A generalized over-dependency of personal property thats the reality then within the experiment in which they are participating They have to try to influence to the people around them Create an atmosphere of tension Could you list some methods how to achieve that How they can develop it You can say "hello" to someone While you think, I would like to throw this garbage inside an oven The intonation should make it very clear what do you mean by that "hello" Any questions? For example, about work at the Institute about your work here in high school Well as a first experiment I might suggest Calculate alcohol and tobacco consumption Of the team members And see what happens in the term One week They won't even know It would be an experiment Is fear a correct way to achieve the objectives? The end justifies the means Based on that You have to define certain methods So don't deny it That depends, of course, In itself the problem is worth it Simply terror can create an atmosphere scared around you That is also a kind of terror Yes, it's not just about blowing up houses and people You can also focus the terror They see him I have also had Before and during the war What to organize, Mass executions And I've been directly involved in those executions I have had to kill people It has to happen if necessary That is also terror Or can you understand in its most obvious sense How to blow up a building Maybe that is necessary in certain situations You will be able to do it if necessary? I repeat The end justifies it. That depends on the objective I see I've noticed that you have a wedding ring Your family will interfere with your commitments? I would say that helps only when it is a normal and healthy family If a husband loves his wife the wife It supports And they have their children That is the goal of a normal person Improve yourself and give the best to your children very well Thank you Thanks for the conversation Thanks a lot It has been a pleasure The boys can wait they are not in a hurry "The boys" are in a hurry I can't be peeling the sausages so fast Do not peel it I have to do it, are you going to eat it with skin on? You don't need to tell me, I know my job Will burn I can leave it if you like Well do what you want What's up Give me some vodka Wait a minute Anger my dear go to the bathroom please Can you fry us some sausages? Not until they give me some vodka How little does the mob need to be happy By the way you can send us a bottle of vodka I thought you were to death against that Maybe kill him That is my intention Of course We are not going You are not going to sweeten them if you have bad intentions There can be no good intentions when you offer alcohol to someone Give me a bottle of vodka I'm not giving it to you, I'm selling it to you. Obviously What do I say, what is it from you? -Send it to them directly, yes Comrade From the table to the kitchen people A courtesy To your health boys Thank you very kind Do you have any dried fish? -How? -Dry fish Can we ask for that? Please you always asking strange things You can not read? here is the menu There we go again The girls in the canteen mistreating us This is how they are characterized the girls in the canteen That arose 3 years after opening the first canteen And then it was classified Stop playing the ass Why? Better than acting like a fool We can only be one thing at a time. I realize Or we can also act like perfect idiots What you prefer Relax Us, relax and enjoy? Clear How long does it take? Slow or fast? The T? No, the relaxation You ask me? How long does it take? No, how do you like it fast or ...? You will have to translate that to me Is flirting Oh that's what they call it now? I'm just not used to it. It's a sociological issue How do you prefer relaxing? We have to stay and observe a moment Athletes Did you miss me Yes, Vanya, honey. Time flies by And we are still young Is my fucking belly a shame? Truth Vika and the rest? -That won't get in the way Vika I also have a belly. God I have gained a lot do you remember how thin she was? for me you are still pretty Will someone marry me? -Of course you are beautiful God save the tsar Wait Lift me up No, no, no, bring it closer. Closer? -To me Will it work? -I think so. No, no, more if you can Is falling Shame on alcoholics! Do you know where they keep the alcohol? In the fridge What is in the dining room We have to get it all out Throw it away and sing shame the alcoholics And sing: Sport, health, socialism! throw it all in the cans and let them see you there ready Let's take it away then We all go together We go down the stairs And we go screaming, we go scream, let's do it So let's go upstairs at once Warm it up?

I turn it over and give you by the side Were you going to grab the sharp side? My hand is not vital, how do you liver Finish him off with a header You missed two hits You could have knocked him out To whom? When you fight with knives Oh well You can fight better and never lose yourself I will be your coach Use your elbow I won't be able to kill you We are closing Vasya, why are you bothering the young man? Don't worry he's not a girl Why do you bother customers? very well Excuse me Vika give me another bottle of vodka How are you Again with the cigar? Cigars? Today you smoked Not at all. You just made the ashtray a small bonfire with so many cigarettes And you smoked them No, I inhaled it You just blow the smoke all over the room Why? Why All smokers think it's okay fill the place with smoke But when I do everyone gets nervous They immediately ask Who is smoking? Agh, agh, how disgusting Why do you do it? Because he wanted to expel them. Expel them or turn them on? what is that smell what is happening? something like that Will you have some coffee? Do you want coffee? Ok Are you really going to torment me? let's make a cigarette bonfire here too and fill the whole place with smoke And do we breathe it all? Yes So the big glass? Yes Good night canteen I like those kinds of calls How so? I like calls when they don't want anything from me. Has been frozen All day How are your fellow scientists They are very Friendly I made them promise That no one would put salt in your vodka Pixies No one would pee in the cider No one would do any harm I think they were really surprised because of what happened with the cider How did they open it and then ... Not like that no They leave the bottles unfinished They leave them on the table, open. Did they take them? Of course they took them You don't know who took them We told them not to You already know how it is here Obviously we didn't know who it was And obviously it wasn't me But someone in the night I take those bottles So there won't be more of that We get along now could I have those red lips? Yes I did it on purpose are we going to drool each other? you look like a clown me too right? my nose is also red? shit if you look like a clown look in the mirror Kiss my nose it didn't work wait I think we are beautiful wait Alina dear have some tea I made it for you what is happening they are sitting talking I can't get on the same wavelength I just can not That saddens me Why? I don't know I don't care to be honest nobody cares. What if something happens? Take you. -What? -What of what? It's green tea Dammit Did you try it? Obviously it is something with alcohol. It's green tea. Let's go Sorry, everything is against your rules I drink and smoke. You are a degenerate. It seems that all scientists they are afraid of you. And I don't know why? yes you are wonderful -Seriously? -Clear. You know i'm a wolf It seems wonderful for a wolf But not for a hare. I feel a little sorry for them Why? I don't know, they have become pitiful people How so? They are always quiet and they don't say much How if they didn't think of anything Before were they happier? Before they were fooling around To be honest they weren't behaving like you And they are supposed to be the intellectuals. All that of the intelligentsia is garbage I mean, how do they read many books? suddenly they are already intellectuals? When i was in prison myself I tried to pass myself off as an intellectual This is easier Because if you are intellectual And you know fancy words etc, Nobody asks you stupid questions How do you do? Why when you start to answer They don't understand you I was talking to the boss of the mafia there I could see that even though he he he was listening to me Did not get me He felt stupid but for him it was easier to say ... Oh yeah right, I understand you We talk later Is that what you did? Almost always, it was very easy For one part at least. But on the other hand, if necessary, he could show teeth. Most of those people they can not do anything They only hit you once And that's your limit Isn't that your limit? No If two people are arguing and one of them He hits the other one, the other can cut your throat While arguing, the former may think If I hit it, I won't get very far Or, with this I can. I find all that ridiculous "Would you be able to kill?" What fucking questions is that? Who the fuck can ask me something like that? How could he not be able to kill? What would stop me? Who could ask a soldier in the middle of war if you would be able to kill? And they were in shock How is it possible? But they have different motives But it's a specific question Can you or can't you? You can Anyone can Now last people have asked me much that. But they don't ask the right question They should ask Why would you be able to kill? Or under what conditions? I don't want to talk about those things now I want to relax Do you want to relax? Come here then What? I'm waiting for you to show me your strength Stronger I can't reach you So what? Let's go Sorry You are upset? give me a second I do not feel anything Wait i help you Sit down What's up What? Hold it tighter Show me your strength Faster Louder louder Get down So Yes You are an animal You're all sweaty. You don't need to go for a run now. Animal Am I an animal? You are You are an animal You look like a little boy Who makes you want to hug What's wrong with you All people are animals But luckily, I am also a bit of a child. Life is boring when deep down, you are not a bit of a child. Yes Do you understand In everything, for work, When you come home. To read the newspapers Talking nonsense in the kitchen Fighting with your wife before bed So is. And life ends When I was little I thought I will become an adult and hence what? What will I become? Will I have a boring life? Adults never smile Only when they're drunk I never wanted to be a drunkard. Do you know a lot of people like that? Not really. -What made you make that decision? -I think I just decided My mother did not drink So what maybe for accompanying her Did your mother love you when you were little? Did she show you her love? -Yes. Enough Didn't you lack affection? I had a good childhood I had my mommy, my daddy, to my grandparents. I really had a very good childhood. Had a grandfather Who spent a lot of time with me He taught me to draw To carve the wood We were backpacking Many people wouldn't think that I grew up like this In fact they think how can I be so aggressive and rabid It sure is because of what I had an unhappy childhood Or, a cruel fate perhaps To a broken family But no. Why would you kill someone? Why do they kill each other in wars? By orders For her own country Do you know what is interesting? When A person kills Or a command It looks like something normal They take orders killing becomes a national duty But when a person independently decides to kill, So we are psychopaths Or criminals who kill for money That is, the people who kill for an ideal They are called terrorists. Insane But above all they call them terrorists These are people who have used their brain That they have meditated on it beforehand. So they just act You see, this seems fine to me then let's do it And that sense of duty it has to be fulfilled And there you are satisfied Owe to whom? Duty to your conscience All these crimes Are determined by your conscience What is your conscience commanding? My conscience orders me all i can do to achieve a better world And create an ideal society That's right Well I don't know Yes, there is an official hierarchy in your group Although it is more or less the same here. Some are up and some are down Some obey orders its normal In any society even in small groups In any case Well that's what I think I like to talk about these topics with you And I don't think it's convenient call them all to my office I don't want everyone here to know I don't want them to realize What am i using you Not me, but we have the intention to make some changes. In this community I am interested in knowing if each of you Would be willing to use extreme methods In function of achieving our objective And yes, it could mean terror in his most ruthless form Destruction Inflicting bodily harm And maybe take someone's life what murder means Let's call things by their name I doubt that all your comrades are you ready for that I guess you've noticed my doubts And my question about family it wasn't random That's definitely a weak point And the arguments weren't very convincing I agree Listen in passing maybe i'm wrong What do you have your own and particular Ideas about family and gender relations Maybe not unique but different to the accepted ones What happens is that I not only think critically I'm also quite cynical That's ok In essence, being cynical is a healthy way to fight hypocrisy That on the one hand On the other, I see the husband as always he is unfaithful to his wife Or boys cheating to his lovers Or wives, or them cheating to their husbands. All that Sooner or later they part Thus I'm not interested in committing in marriage with anyone That first And in second place I may not be the only one Why today most men they are polygamists I mean they want to lie down with as many women as possible There is the war of the sexes how in so many other things And that is not in my plans Not at all I'd say it doesn't really add me up. He told me that family strengthens. I do not think so, it's a rope to hang yourself Nothing can hang me if I don't have anyone I see Maxim, I have many more questions, I think I will contact you directly I'll see how to do it And then we will discuss the details And I can tell you my expectations And you can tell me how realistic they are And how could we make them come true Agree? Excellent Thank you See you Are you testing them? -Goodnight -Goodnight Do you think it's OK? The training is on We still don't compete but ... I dodged it. You lost balance Let's go, leave them alone Marine Excuse us for a moment please? Sit down -Want some of you? -No thanks It's serious business Regarding our boys All of them... Are they men of action? Yes About our men of action We have something to discuss In my opinion they are more or less ready to act They must be given the last Strategic objectives But that's my job. It's a start for them It is the future for them. It's a beautiful start a reliable trampoline And for us a good way to retire I tell you... After we get over this When everything is over I would like to retire I'm tired -Of course -And I would like to start something new -I have no strength -Sure, look What is coming will mean a good ending for your services I want to conclude everything very well I will do my best so as not to disappoint you But I really would like to retire when all this is over Okay. In fact I'm already waiting my pension Sure, you can go And what will you do when you retire? Or have you not decided yet? Who knows maybe just rest half a year Yes, sure I'll throw myself on the couch, read a book and rest. How about going on a trip, or going fishing? I would like to return to my home in the Crimea In fact I would like to go to the Crimea I am thinking of buying an apartment there I see. Will you have enough money? -I'm sure Maybe with some cooperative Little by little I will establish myself or I will look for a house I even think a house is better A house could be much better In Yalta for example Go around in bathing suits In Sevastopol or any another big city Of course a house would be better A little boat That would be fine I would be ready for a good rest I don't know in how much time I will have to leave them But I think they could be another ten years I will come to visit you Please do it Vika, are you already making my fries? - My fries? -M�xim, enough - Your fries -Yes French fries with what? Only french fries And cheese croquettes Give me one to try We are being good customers here and look how are you? Comrades The revolution awaits us Bring your croquettes Thank you, we are going full We're going to steal our forks too. Wait, my takeout? Think about it. Or do not want? What? I can not hear you. Don't you want to go to D-1? For what? You know what for. Let's go Come here. Anger, it will only be a second Listens There is no us. It means there is nothing among us. Did you understand So. Not interested? Is that this, it's unnecessary If you say so. See you. How long until the pancakes are you ready? What is the action plan? Let's get the pigs out I can't find my badge Maxim go without a cap? What happened to her? That is Maximum Cute in her suit You will discuss the latest trends youth fashion? Dammit Hello This is a gift from our team We would like to take a pig with us. And paint it some slogans make some complaints and put it in the residence They are not easy to grasp. We will only release one. We are strong. I'm tired of you. I can't hear so much noise. Put the cube in his snout. -Let's go -raise it up Grab it Let's go we go Do you think there is a wall there? I can't stand his yelling. Come on, move, move. They hold the bag as the caregiver does. And walk alongside it. What are they giving it to the commands for You take it Move, move You already have it -yes A little more for the love of God Move it, move it, move it I'm holding it Is grunting Quick wear it. -Taking -Thanks a lot What brings you here? Vladimir Arkadevich, I'm sorry For taking my freedom But I need your advice I hear you It's hard to explain Something is happening Our communists, the athletes Those young people? Yes Basically ... I don't even know what's wrong with me I am completely lost You are not in love or are you? No I don't know, I think maybe. I don't know what to do Tell me I have become an idiot What are we discussing here? I've come to tell you about Maxim. Comrade Martsinkevich. What's with him? He's a lovely boy Yes, you like I can't say that I share your feelings romantics for him. But I like it so well he's a good boy A very decent young man How close are they? have you slept with him? Of course "Of course" you say. I will be honest with you Yes you ... You sleep with a man That means he trusts you fully, truth? That tells you everything. The things it does and how. What are the plans you have, If he is serious with you. He will include you in his future, right? You are right, in theory We talk about it The thing is, I couldn't tell. Yes, I want stability. I want stability But I don't know if I want her with him Yes you already know so to hell with him Because you need it? You will lose part of your heart wasting it on nothing It is the first time in several years, What do I feel that has awakened something that is real I do not understand why I do not wanna lose it I felt empty until meeting maxim This guy, I don't know what your problem is, But he really needs affection. And love I could say that the same I don't like it We even talk about it he said it himself He said that he hates himself Himself "I don't feel sorry for myself." But how could he not be hurt, And have it to the others -Yes I think he is just a young communist A young communist that could explain it Yes all our workers were like maximum I tell you Tomorrow I would request my retirement I go at peace with myself And i mean it I would honestly like everyone they were a little more like Maximum. Has a very sharp mind Your heart beats strong Consider all your actions He knows very well what he will achieve in the future In a month, or in a year Plans it and does it It is wonderful Don't think it's bad what you feel Just think How good they feel when they are together And in the good things to come Love is a feeling that ...

Let's go. Tell me something. Conscience is haunting me. Is your conscience haunting you? That makes me want to run away. Do you want to run away from me? This is totally against of my rules but for some reason I think ... Basically ... Oh forgive me for having told you yesterday I don't want anything That's the last thing I want. Hurt you, if I have. Hurt you What I wanted was to break cleanly That was, The best way to put it The best way? From a logical point of view, yes You got it Clear. Please forgive me. I was just scared Of me? Scared of myself But at least now I do that i'm alive What else do you need? You know you are alive Did you have any questions? What am I alive? You can find yourself going to work as if you were a robot? Maximum For almost 10 years, I have worked like this. Maybe yes ... maybe it works. And perhaps the risk of pain. It works if you feel alive sometime Animal Stop I have to go to work But if you can have a glass of wine while you work, or not? What? May I smell it? Stop now No, it smells like a drink It was apple juice Apple juice, really? My love Suddenly tomorrow or tonight you decide ...

Yes Ok Who the fuck knows what will happen next Fuck we agree no fuck -Yes? -Yes. Hello Go ahead, Maxim Put down your coat and have a seat How are you doing? Nothing bad Scientists don't want to change They are resisting. Yet I think we are having positive results They had immense stamina. He has confronted them using quite a few methods interesting and creative. The Komsomol method That was good, I watched with great enthusiasm What do you think that is the form correct. In general you have completed homework I don't think you could have done better You always walk a line Very fine And that worries me Since, you live with these people. Could you start to form personal relationships And empathize with some people And show them a kindness unacceptable Fortunately, everything it is going very well. It even goes climbing. And all your actions are direct and sincere That is great, it's very good Except what's a little childish that kind of command the problem is much more serious How now do you know This Institute is a cesspool A den of doom It's superficial decency It is courteous, This love for novels This love to discuss the affairs of the day, Those scientific discussions, While they are smoking and drinking, They are actually drunkards alcoholics Nothing good they have Even in their daily lives. They all have formal relationships The ones that keep daily between them But actually, they are all rotten Completely rotten. They will never get better So you get rid of all the vodka. Or raise your banners They are not going to get better. Now listen carefully Regarding the Institute, The decision has been made in high command This establishment, this Institute, It is going away Completely There will be nothing left. No room, No document, No team, No device, And most importantly, Entire workforce It has to be liquidated. They all have to be eliminated. You have to do it. You group, It will be expanded to 30 people, This number will be more than enough. They are going to retire from here to all the security guards. There will be no Guard they will be sent to train For you and your group. This is a great honor. This is a platform, Where can you start from, At some point we we will no longer be here. But you could stay. And in a few decades it could be you. Whoever has to build, A sober and healthy society. Armed with ideas. Ideas that society values. And with which we can move forward. Advance and improve Don't be shy, ask That is the final decision? None should be left alive? Nobody. Poor, in that case, you will show no mercy, Neither women nor the elderly. It has to be. It must be done. Any weakness has to be cleared So we like them, or not. They must not exist. We cannot draw a line and say These are good and these are not. Those are the weak and these are the ones that serve us. Some of them could have been ... But in this case, they are useless. They just waste space. They are trash. They must not even exist. When? Coming Soon. Damn pillow. Lie closer I want to hug you Come here love I want you to lie here I want to feel you -I will crush you -No Please, I want to feel you here So. Well here we go -Is someone behind? -Don't kill him. Good -Wait a second -Let's go , could you throw it over there Let's do it Mother bitch, push it further in Come on, move! Give him a hand, he doesn't drop it. What remains? the special department? The special department, the two laboratories. So, let's go to the small lab. We will need a car in the special department The canteen is finished Sure, did you check it out? -I will check the D1 All good there? -Yes everything is fine, perfect. We are going to move the car here, it will be easier
