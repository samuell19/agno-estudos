In a cave carved in the side of a mountain in the Himalayas, a young abbot tibetan wrote a meditation for the world as he perceived it, and what could become of this. The year was 1968. "Although I live in the mud and filth of the dark ages, although stumbling against the thick fog of materialism, the tradition of meditation is waning, and we are drunk on spiritual pride". This is considered as a was very grim. In a time in which the sensatéz of the world has disappeared in a certain sense. This is the time of hell on Earth... the sadness that is constantly with us, and the depression fills our minds. The chinese had invaded... and there was a previous era in which Tibet was a spiritual paradise. But now it was a living hell. The teachings were going to lose, if they could not be transferred to the west, then his whole function in life was to make that transfer. Looked like that was a necessity. He never gave up with no one. In showing us the full potential of our humanity The heretics and bandits of hope and fear are transformed... the "Crazy wisdom". Crazy wisdom. The person with the "Crazy wisdom", which is... the direct translation of the tibetan yeshe chölwa". "Yeshe" means wisdom, "Chölwa" is to become wild. Then it would be something like: insanity turned into wisdom. We had this conversation back in the 72, I think, in San Francisco. We were comparing our itineraries and I said: "Don't you get tired of being constantly on the move?, I if." He said, "Oh, it's because you don't like your poetry". I told him "I'm Not sure of that." He said: why don't you do like the great poets? Why not leave the stage and compose? What for you need a paper, don't trust your own mind? "The red flag flies over the Potala, the people of Tibet are drowning in a sea of blood. A vampire army occupies the mountains and plains, but the dignity of exist never wanes." When I was 18 months Chogyam Trungpa was recognized as a master reincarnated. At that time he was given the title "Rinpoche," which means precious jewel. That generation was the last generation that was able to get the full training in Tibet with the greatest masters. The meditation of my father, and everything else is made easier, and became stronger. To Chogyam Trungpa was assigned to a teacher... that was a person extremadamenet wise. "Khenpo Gangshar Wangpo" meaning the lord of everything that comes up. The monks usually were sitting with the "mala" or prayer beads counting beads and chanting the mantra, and Khenpo Gangshar came and snatched the "bad" of the hands to a monk and he tore it and said: I...aggression, ...craving, ...ignorance! It was demonstrated that they were doing something for custom that didn't have a real meaning. I said that I should go to see him. I did not dare, always ran. If he said or did something, I was terrified. Drawing from his monastery, Surmang - by Chogyam Trungpa The chinese presenting the doctrine called communism and realizing that they can't indoctrinate anyone, they had to push much harder. Attacked Surmang. The chinese troops stormed the libraries and kicked out all the valuable books. The treasures of precious metals in the shrines were destroyed and shipped to China. Even desecrated the tomb of the Tenth Trungpa and they left exposed the embalmed corpse. Born in Tibet. - Chogyam Trungpa. Khenpo Gangshar told people, "Everything that we've been doing here in terms of buddhism has ended." Khenpo Gangshar said, "we Cannot fight against the chinese communists and we should surrender." That is the sign of "surrender" to the chinese. Had to leave my country. We were like 300 in the group. It took four months to horse and six months walk to be able to come to India. Although Chogyam was so young, he knew exactly what we had to do to get there. Somehow, I don't know how, he managed. Had No compass, but I had very good binoculars... and I could see to a great distance. Then we have to hide in the day and walking at night through of the mountains and the ice. And then start walking into the river. When we reach the other side, we know that we have little time. The difficulty is not having enough food. And people are dying of hunger. We ended up cooking our laces. Cutting them in pieces and cook. I agree masticándolas... it was so horrible! If they attack us, we must not kill any chinese. We must not steal what belongs to another in the journey. There should not be disagreements between us. Each one of us has weapons. But in our group no one killed anything. Ten months later, 13 of the 300 people who escaped and crossed the border to India. Some died of starvation. Others fired, arrested, or simply disappeared. Still, others continued to Trungpa and got get to a safe place months after. The Indian Air Force flew to Chogyam Trungpa of the border to her freedom. "When the bird of iron flies, the buddhism will travel to the land of the red man." Padmasambhava, 800 D. C. My work is dedicated to present a notion of enlightenment to the west. The world is not going to be rescued very simply, only by the religion, but that can also be rescued by lighting. This world needs both of your help. So part of this world... I would like to turn you to come in and do something about it. You need enormous faith in the people to create a enlightened society. You can not have a attitude part. And he had that kind of faith, it was not because we were amazing people, but by the appreciation inherent Trungpa by the wisdom of the world. The main point seems to be about... this life. Don't be a coward with fear of seeing things. With fear of being busy. With fear of smile. With fear of acknowledging that we are basically good. Or as they call americans: "chickening out" 1963 - Chogyam Trungpa received a scholarship to study in England. When I met him he was still a monk with his robe and I seemed to be extremely young, almost ethereal, as if he could become light at any time. A bit like a beautiful flower. All his gestures seemed pure. Now I don't remember what he said, but we were overwhelmed by your presence. It seems somewhat naive to say something like that, but I had something very special. Dharma: The body of teachings used to open the mind of a student to the reality of things the reality of things as they are in reality. I was going through a period in which I was examining as I was going to teach. I think I wasn't yet sure of what it would be the best way to teach to westerners. Rinpoche was doing several courses to become familiar with the western culture. I was trying to deduce the experience directly for themselves same, the suffering of the human condition in the west. It seemed that he wanted to reach a reverence of suffering, and say: This is what is happening and be able to have the words that we we could understand, and would allow us to say: yes! 1967 - Trungpa Rinpoche and Akong Rimpoche created Samye Ling in Scotland The first Buddhist Center Tibetan in the west. There was an article in the supplement in color of the Telegraph. And there was a picture of the whole page in full color with Trungpa and Akong standing on the lawn, to the front. And when you see it I said to myself: "I have to be with him." So I quit my job and gave my house and I went to Eskdalemuir. He studied at the University of Cambridge and I decided to start again with him. Legué to the station of Lockerbie late at night. There was not public transport to take me. Then I walked up to Samye Ling, which are more like 27 miles. I think I had to take 6 hours. For me, its mandate was always that the biggest change should be internal, and that without meditation there is no progress The teachings were at times in the moment, in conversation, in their room. Sometimes very late in the night. That was where I learned more. We got into many problems because then we slept until late and we did not do the morning meditation. Rinpoche also left Samye Ling and change their blanket common clothes and wandered around London. And he said that he loved the cinema, as they were red velvet dark and reminded her of Tibet. Had that warmth that I missed. He had been working in an office as a translator and he invited me to be his private secretary. He said that he planned to travel to Bhutan and India and he asked me if I wanted to go with him. Of course I said yes. My trip to Bhutan was an invitation from the Queen of Bhutan and take my retreat at Taktsang where you actually meditated. Rinpoche said here was supposed to be where guru Padmasambhava had thrown her rosary of crystal and had become a waterfall. 800 D. C. The great indian saint, Padmasambhava stopped the spread of the wars tribal for bringing buddhism to Tibet. Being in Taktsang is not very impressive at the beginning. What is this place? Because it is assumed that it is amazing what is going on here? Maybe I chose the wrong place. Perhaps there is a Taktsang on the other hand, the true Taktsang. But in reality there are energies and powers are immense. Things start to arise. Although I live in the mud and filth of the dark ages, although stumbling against the thick fog of materialism, The Sadhana came to me without problems. It took Me like 5 hours to write it all The Dharma is used for personal benefit, and the rio materialism has grown beyond its shores. THE materialistic point of view dominates everywhere. When it came to the Sadhana to his mind was a realization and that was what was written. The idea of the dark ages. Spiritual values had been lost. We can see all the damage we have done to the planet, because of the materialism. And that hypocrisy is incredible. Trungpa rinpoche returns to Scotland with the liturgy he wrote in the cave of Padmasambhava. Trungpa Rinpoche had come to the west to transmit the teachings authentic buddhism to westerners. Akong wanted the Centre Samye Ling in Scotland outside of a home for tibetan refugees. Then, they had points of view very different, for that are development a lot of conflict between them. People used to get mad a lot because I was not teaching, and they wanted to the teaching to satisfy their own greed spiritual to be able to say that they were disciples of Trungpa rinpoche, and is doing this to take me on the path to liberation, or something like that. And they realized that in reality I wasn't doing anything, just this drunk or trying to seduce my girlfriend, or being extravagant. It was absolutely electrifying that first time I saw it, I had never passed anything like this. I was at school in Cambridge and had to find a way to go. I spent at least 24 hours in bed with the I think that was the first time in my life that I felt that I could communicate completely with someone. At some point I said, maybe one day we could marry. And I said: "Oh definitely, yes!, I would love to do that." Had to do the shopping, so we drove to nearby villages. Surely that was the time when Trungpa and Akron learned to handle. Were lost-time cases to handle, none of the two grew up with paved roads or traffic. I always thought that you should not let a rear tibetan behind the wheel. I had heard that he was the best pilot, I was with a girl in the car and I don't know if he had taken but the car went out of control and went through the window of a tavern. And there was Trungpa Rinpoche in a camillaen the corridor, had cut the throat, and had many stitches, and after they found that he was paralyzed on the left side. I was so sore, and it took quite some time before I could recover some movement on the left side of the body. I couldn't cook for himself, or make the bed nor is it that you remember wanting to make a bed... You couldn't be with him without realizing that there was an internal struggle extraordinary in the. I think that this time period in particular was one of the darkest moments of his life. Before the accident Trungpa rinpoche had spoken about the dilemma he felt he called it "the golden Buddha on the pedestal" The main point is to be able to teach completely in the western world. It also feels a fascination general on the response of the people, and when I speak to them with the mantle, not hear you but look at your mantle. The people could not ok, I think that they felt threatened. The English, with their sense of convention would have wanted to have something like a "Guru-pet" and at the same time the tibetans wanted to use his mantle and was hidden behind this subtle sense of superiority tibetan. The was completely unusual and genuine being who, in reality, it was and was rejected by it. I said that I felt that I was at a critical point in his life. "I'm on the verge of becoming enlightened, and when it comes to this time, go crazy or attain realization." Which, of course, made me feel anxiety because I had finished to marry with the Diana, 16, runs away to marry a monk. After it all happened very quickly. It was the catalyst for the transformation, the rise in the world. And surrender to the personality of the monastic, and the rest, as they say, is history. What made you commit for 3 years of your life to him? What you have kept him? It was not that I compromised. It sounds as if it would have made a generous offer, it was not so. It was not felt as if you were compromising my life, you know... I loved to be with him. And it is 40 years ago... that was such a good friend... is gone, but he was a good friend. Therefore it was not a commitment... but that came naturally. This is for that. It came and went. Shambhala: Ancient teachings of how to create. Ancient teachings of how to create an enlightened society based on the courage based on courage and compassion. He met another of the major "tulkus", its the same age, whom he had known in Tibet, Thrangu Rinpoche, in India, asked: What are you going to do now? And he pulled out his mirror. A small mirror metal that had hung in the neck. Your mirror was a form of prophesy, to see the future in the mirror. And began to look in the mirror. And to describe the Shambhala. And he said it as if you were there, and I can see. That was the only clue he gave that he was going to go to the united States to find the Shambhala. Stop bombing human beings, animals and vegetation. If Jesus Christ were here tonight, would not dare to drop another bomb. It was a tumultuous time where there was a a passionate search for a meaning. It had to do with resistance to the Vietnam war and the role of the united States looking for aggression that way. The motivation for a radical action policy was the introspection about human liberation. That human beings had a great potential for freedom. Freedom of expression, of emotion and of thought. There was a personal aspect in the path of growth. The release personal and the political could not be separated but to be part of the same path. First Meditation Center founded by Trungpa in the united States. In the summer of ' 70 we moved our apartment by a car and decided to make a trip in the. It turned out to be a summer very crazy and psychedelic. Park to the front of a farm, very dirty, with junk cars and washing machines with hippies ragged wandering. We rang at the door and a woman opened it, Fran, and asked me: What do you do? And I said: I Am as an artist. She said: "Oh my God, come quick! And it took me to a cuartico in the background, opened the door and said: "What I found" and he said, "Oh, I've been waiting for, sit down". He had asked her to go get someone who know to draw. There was a weekend program called "Work, sex and money". And I thought: "I am interested in those things" not in that order necessarily. The truth I saw it as a buddhist, I was not looking for buddhism, or any path, religious in particular. I just thought that it was someone who told the truth, in fact, I thought that the invented, only that it was so insightful that I could point out the nature of reality. When we speak of the tradition tártrica, we do not speak simply of play with sex. or "dzogchen" or "kaulas", the phenomenal world. We do not talk about those areas yet. We have to be very interested in the basic aspects of the matter instead of thinking that everything is going to be very good and "great" and not wonder why, "if you ask them that is your problem, but if not, everything will be fine." "Let's dance and we play music together, drink honey with milk." So does not work He had begun to draw this letter called "a" that is the "syllable seed" for them, as the bird of all what has been created. Is the "syllable seed" primary. It can be simplified as a point in space. Then I sat for two hours and he knew how to worked the eye, I knew of geometry and Botticelli and while more remained, I thought: That experience, at the end of a teacher really, because I thought that was an artist, a hippie tibetan. Immersed himself fully in american culture when he arrived here. And it was not in a calculated way, which was going to act and dressing like a hippie to be able to communicate with them but I was fascinated by what he was doing the people basically wanted to devour him whole. In a moment I was concerned about the issue of celibacy, because I had read all the books of hindu yoga, who taught what important that was the celibacy in the meditation and just when I was going to ask about it, someone knock at the door. It was Diana, and said: "come lovely." And he had a towel yellow that barely covered it and I didn't know whether to look at the floor or her. And then she kissed it and said, "I almost go to bed, precious." She was and I had to ask nothing. He taught you as a human being, he never said follow me imítenme, but said, "I am completely who I am and I want help you to understand how to be completely who you are." And he said, "studying the dharma that is the truth of trusting who you are" discover your own basic goodness, your innate wisdom, and the importance of being compassionate" that has nothing to do with religion The sanctuary was the attic of an old farm, that had a few posts and these studs became a favourite place for support during sitting meditation to be able to doze off, or hold and go for the easy way out. One day we went to the shrine and there were no posts. He had gone two weeks before and had requested that taken away from you without us to know. That was how it worked, most of the times it was a small change, nothing showy, but suddenly where you used to pass the time and let you fall, no I was comfortable, then now you have to hold. This is a picture of the door of Karmê Chöling, was a white gate of an old farm, despintandose and said that he wanted to paint it as the input for the Dharma in the west. It was very important. I mean, sacred geometry and how it intersected with how they were willing your eyes on geometric patterns and as the geometry of the door would go directly to your eye and cause signals in your brain. We were not able to prepare the color turquoise leave all materials in the shed and there was a girl of about 5 years playing and when we went to the store for the teachings, she threw all the paints into a bucket and I had mixed and when we came back, we saw that it was the turquoise perfect and it was already getting dark, so Trungpa rinpoche said that it was perfect. We put all the cars and put them in a semi-circle with the lights on in the shed, while he monitored the implementation of the turquoise. There is a legend of the Buddha, where the clubhouse blossomed a lotus. Almost all parties where you got Trungpa in the united States there was a Tibetan Center Trungpa established Boulder, Colorado as the center of their community. In the first year, I invite the whole community that it will fit in your room to visit him and asked him to all that bring their bags of marijuana or another drug. And half of them thought: "my god, my God, this guru is so cool, want to smoke with us." They all arrived and were in very good mood and asked them to put all the paraphernalia in a large tray in the center and the fireplace was lit, all very homey and wonderful. He began to greet and talk to everyone and was pulling a bag drug after another to the fire by making sparks and reventándose and began singing, "we're burning the self-deception," with each bag, the fire burned more. Assuming that you, or the so-called "you"-, since we do not know if we exist or not... The so-called "you" is lit... And what about after that? Of course, the automatic response is: "I become Buddha, the enlightened one." Is about to become a self-centered. It is becoming a self-centered, it is not just to point... he is thinking that he can get the very Buddha. Trungpa founded the Institute Naropa, the first buddhist university in the western hemisphere. The Institute Naropa in the summer of ' 74 was a kind of distillation. It was like what happened at Woodstock, suddenly there was a big movement across the country and met there. We didn't have a building, desks, phones, or stationery, but an idea. We invite religious figures, indian masters american, zen masters, hindu masters superstars like Ram Dass who came with a retinue of "ladies love" as we call them, dressed in white. There were people there that I was not in the way of religion as Gregory Bateson said. We come to Naropa trying to figure out what it is. We invite you to many poets such as Allen Ginsberg that was a school of poetry in itself. Don Allen! Do you see potential to Jazz, Blues and Rock 'n' Roll? Maybe the Jazz and the Blues have more of a chance of prosperity but the Rock 'n' Roll has less. Why do you believe? It is a matter of consent perceptions sense of the individual. It is very Coca-Cola. Have you experienced majesty, calm and peace in any song of rock and roll you've heard? Unfortunately it does not. So try because it is very difficult, right? In a moment, I thought that there was something happening by high, but it was not what I was doing. He loved the poets, the artists, the misfits. It seemed that I never wanted to control the energy, when he founded Naropa, but he said that he wanted to fly sparks. What we did was to bring together the east and the the west, was the creation of a new hybrid He said that normally you want to create a kind of diplomatic relation but what he wanted was to maintain the integrity of each tradition and letting it crash to flying sparks The water is so precious, so much. It is like love. When it comes to Naropa established a program and they put me on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, I think and Trungpa had Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday The two were going after the truth, and his way of it was a buddhist and mine was a hindu. People liked to receive the two points of view. I I was fascinated with this that looked like a game of tennis. Trungpa was saying this, the other said that... If we are going to discuss spirituality in this class, I would get nerves and you also should give, we're not building guile mutual between us. We have coined this term called spiritual materialism. The spiritual materialism, which is dedicated to try to find the "I" using mantras, songs, meditation of all types to become a better person and more powerful. Never gave a talk in the first 8 years without reminding people how silly it was to cling to the spirituality to be salvaged. It was cruel, ruthlessly taking apart what you use to hang a version built for the "I". Burlémonos of the "I"-, but let's build our spirit the spirit in this case has a curiosity that something might have happened, the possibility that something has passed but the approach of the "I" is "what it's going to be good for me should I do it or not, you are going to have an economic compensation?" Trungpa was the head and I the heart. Things like the soul, God, Rama and Krishna and all that. That seems crammed in comparison to the. It is absolutely important to make the practice the meditation the source of his strength it is also your basic intelligence, think about that. Can also sit back and do nothing 10 or 20 minutes, just sitting doing nothing. Can think of the Institute Naropa while they are sitting. Should not be ashamed of telling your family and friends who have learned a very important message: That you can survive by doing nothing. Rinpoche had a great command of the English language. He said: "English is a language blessed". He spoke as farmer, as trader, as the people of Oxford but it was not just an imitation but his mind crept in to the american mentality and I knew that I had to do it through language. You used the word inaccessible referring to the teachings of the Vajrayana, what are you suggesting? Well, it is very rare and therefore you probably will not understand. It is as if ordenaras steak tartar very few people ask for such a dish, usually ask for hamburger or hot dog. The steak tartar is very rare (or lightly cooked). A crucial moment was when the great sixteenth Karmapa, who was the head of the lineage of Chogyam Trungpa was going to come to the united States. He tells this great news to the students and their response is: "Great!, but seriously, do we have to aspire for him?" We need someone to help light the candles. Immediately. He worked for hours tirelessly getting ready for this visit. Made the people get decent clothes, cut hair, put a suit and tie, most were in the Army of Salvation to get them there because no one had money. This infuriated the people. The sexual part is not conmocionaba to the people then, neither of the drinks, but what about wearing a suit? Are you crazy? Many of the students were at that time in protest. All forms or rituals are disciplines, ways of changing the mind. First of all to create a kind of alert, to be able to appreciate what was going on. And second, to connect with the activity particular that he was developing. Know a certain majesty internal to know the majesty outside of one's self. What we have recommended is that we cortemos long hair, we put on ties and go back to the conventional of the institutions of the u.s. and try to influence healthy from inside there. Exact. We always have problems amansándonos, that's why we have to resort to religion. Amansarse, meaning... simply... be decent. Without ups and downs. A sense of balance... A sense of balance... a natural state of existence. This type of training is in need of a teacher it was difficult to be close many times. I once asked because there were no more students come in to see him, or call him by phone. And he said to me, it seems to me that it is because there is fear students in the desenmascararse, exposed. This was a very important principle for him, that the people you had the courage to work with their own deceptions. Whence comes the purpose and motivation in the enlightened mind is free of desires and struggles? Where is your determination? Well, the determinations come from having a sense of self-confidence, a sense of rectitude, a sense of loyalty, a sense of appreciation for his own family, and his close world around. There is a cloud in the sky and the sky is blue, and the sun comes out beautifully in the east and... flakes of snow fall and have a beauty when they fall to the ground. And everything is perfect... If, more or less... Always he was showing us the style of the "Crazy wisdom" and the teaching was that there was no certainty, and you could have a sense of humor about it. Independence day. We don't want to be completely sane. And that seems to be the problem usually that we cannot handle too much sanity and we like to have a little slice of neurosis in some part. Even in our pockets. A small puff of smoke here and there, if there are too much sanity to be able to say: "oh, That was intense!" It is normal that such a teacher confuses the expectations of the people close to him. And often behaved in the opposite way to what people considers appropriate to a person so illustrious. This is a tradition tártrica of Tibet, the of enjoy of your senses is in itself to express wisdom. Benjamin Franklin said, wine is the test of that God loves us and wants us to be happy. It is not a new idea. But if I was drinking too much... Thomas Jefferson also. Be ruined by buying good wine of France to drink it. It was safe to say that their level of awareness of the environment was not affected by alcohol. At the very beginning I was giving a talk with a guru, west of the new era and the presence of Rinpoche on the stage was a complete drunk, and not really gave a talk but he spent nearly falling of the chair... At the end of the talk they took it loaded to the elevator and soon rose and said: "How was that?" I was not drunk, was not lost, but so chose to interact with this charlatan. A lot of people I try to get Rinpoche to stop drinking, he sent petitions and letters signed by many people. I remember in one of his talks served the sake diluted on water and raised the eyebrow and said: "this is watered down". It is elemental madness, in other words, fearlessness. Do not give up anything, it seemed to be the fundamental issue. Willing to work with the body is there on the basis of the quality of monitors paramount. That seems to be the definition of the "Crazy wisdom". Trungpa rinpoche supported the issue of the sexuality and the alcohol. Basically, I defended them, because I like to practice buddhism and I know that the "crazy wisdom" is something real, but I had to recognize certain defects, in my opinion, for example: I Think he died at the age of 47 and they could still be doing a useful work, and fantastic if it had not been a an alcoholic, definitely, whatever the diagnosis, I was drinking too much. People ask me: How can you follow such a teacher as this? Or how can you do that an enlightened person? I don't know. I cannot accept a defense as that was an activity sacred or something like that, or come up with a reason to approve it. I can't think of a reason to fail. I'm on that: I don't know, I don't know. But I can't answer the questions because the challenged order to answer them. When Suzuki Roshi died Chogyam Trungpa gave a talk at the Zen Center and while giving the talk said that Suzuki Roshi was a great teacher and a great friend and in that moment she began to cry probably could see that we were trying to hold back and gave us permission to all the crying. That was a great teaching. Most of the cultures in their beginning they have some kind of idea of trying to pull out the noblest part of the human spirit. Rinpoche was looking for examples that work in the west I didn't just impose the examples eastern to his western students in the United States, the president lives and works in your home and in Europe, the place where the monarch lived was also the seat of the government that was one part, I think that he realized that that was a very good example that it already existed. The Court was an environment very fertile that was his home, and a kind of community center at the same time. In Boulder, when I was still living, my job main and my title was "master of the house" of the Court of Kalapa. A typical night in the Court can be with music Mozart, Handel, she loved the water Music of Handel. A formality british stiff so ironic. We called each other Mr. Paysinger or Mrs. Fordham. This is not just to say something good but that anything and everything can be dear when we find ourselves with a consciousness of discovering any kind of power for this there is nothing excluded from the practice that's why I proposed a practice for anything absolutely anything, take a cup of tea, combing hair, putting the interior in a drawer... Once I could see him setting the table it took him 3 hours, because it was like a work of art to put on the table. The way they spoke the american he looked very scruffy. And it seemed to him that if not trying to improve the way you talk there was a way in which the body and the mind were not united then the speech is one of the things that can unite them, for to have everything in order, synchronizing your body, speech and mind. Took that further and started not only to to teach people how to speak English but he decided to teach them the English of the queen of England The how to speak the English language, and how not to talk to us. I'll give you an example of the exercise of elocution. "Spider is black" "the Sky is blue." "How tantalizing, this world." "Kathy''s hair is black" "Her complexion is white." "Her attention is like a bow string." "More than monuments" "More than tattered." "More than dying", "The liberty bell is more than antique." In the long run I was trying to demonstrate as the sound had an element sacred so even though we apparently torture people making them repeat these words again and again. I think it was much more about the appreciation. Then it became a practice display we arrived, we wore the uniform and walking towards a display we imagined as the servants enlightened of the enlightened master and somehow all of it was true. In a certain way was reality, the other was a representation. He said that to be able to make an enlightened society had to change the culture and to change the culture had to change the art and to change the art had to change the principles on which was based the art. And those principles, he said, should be the of Art Dharma. The basic notion of art is how to relate to oneself and how to relate to with his own phenomenal world with grace. In the Art Dharma, instead of looking at a painting of a river, it is more like being in the water of the river. When there is a sufficient sense of space, then we can relax more, and we started to realize that when there is... the sick world, that any artistic endeavor is considered sacred. When that happens, there is no more struggle. The idea of art Dharma is to receive images, it is not a gloating egotistical. The only thing you did was see it and bring it to the surface. The caught the fish, not created it. Things are sacred, not in the sense of religious meaning but sacred in the sense that there is a dignity innate in the way we see our world. I was sitting in the altar of a church smoking a cigarette and someone asked him to talk about aggression in the United States, and said: "I want to talk about the aggression in this room." This was the Dorje Kasung, it was called as well because it means "protect the sacred space". Chogyam Trungpa believed that every aspect of the society should be explored each one of them, so did theatre groups, trade educational institutions and also I think the buddhist version of the army. All of them mortificaba the idea, but he always said that until we get to the heart of the aggressiveness in the society and transform that same energy to be the forces of peace, we can't change of truth the way things work. I was involved in organizations and marches to protest by the presence of the united States in Vietnam. That comes to feel was that we were doing that we didn't have more insight of the fundamental problem of the aggressiveness the army and the government that we protested. The principle of Shambhala is what is known as "the way of The warrior" here does not mean the warrior as the creator of war but the warrior in the sense of courage, to be brave. We did military training for hours, and once in a when we had visitors, and one of them asked. What is making this thing military? His response was that someday people would see the Dorje Kasung marching down a street and they make you feel like you want to smile and at that time they will have changed something in the center of modern society, the problem as I was. It took us ten years to realise that he was teaching buddhism traditional we didn't know because if you read buddhism traditional sit like: What? But his amazing skill with the language to translate that to our to be able to touch your heart and also was able to give curiosity to your mind so you felt that your process was in truth what is described traditionally as "the way it's going under yours and your going to make continuously it is that you're going to encounter." The first time I met Trungpa, John said: "Rinpoche, I want to introduce you to my wife Agnes." And Rinpoche did so, and grabbed me by the hand and greeted me, and then he said to John: "Your wife seems to me very attractive" and I jumped behind John, looking to Rinpoche on his shoulder, thinking: "what is he talking about? who is this guy?" Many of his students were his lovers and was known. My impression of that community was that this was part of what was happening, and was discovered I remember watching Rinpoche with his entourage and we could clearly see who was who in the entourage. Of course in the zen-world the things are the more decks, the thing that became a problem. - Can you push it a little more, sweetheart? - If it is ok. How do you say "sweetheart" in japanese? - Not what is. - do you Not know? Did not hide anything. Or their drink or their sexuality. There are so many western teachers and asian in the west have fallen in disgrace for what they call "bad sexual conduct" but if you look closely, that was not what made them fall, was that the students were mocked and deceived. The first time you lay with another, after I married him, it was crazy, I sat on the floor of the bathroom crying all night and the next day I went and I told him I was destroyed, I could not believe that we would have married and would now to get divorced because he was sleeping with other and he said to me: "it is Not that do not love you, our relationship it is much stronger than the sexual fidelity". "I can never be a husband traditional, but you can trust completely in our relationship and mutual love" "but it's not going to be conventional." What was the sexual activity was free the desire in place of to create more. Then it takes that pulse of desire that is so great and applies a kind of wakefulness, where in reality these there until the end, an idea is very powerful. Sometimes I would sit with him for up to 4 hours in almost complete silence at times I felt very alone. My husband Jonathan and I were already married at that time, so it was not easy for him, has always said, not always very enlightened: I'm in number two after the teacher and it is true. Was jealous. It was more like: Ah! then your if you can to have a special relationship with him and I can't. The truth to call it a relationship would be difficult, because I did not have this strength. We're not talking about Trunpa Rinpoche as a person, but as the manifestation of that mind, which took advantage of the reality as it is and was able to wake people up but only because you shared that mind. In the west it is difficult to understand the devotion in the tibetan tradition from the outside it seems as if all these little people follow the steps of this great person but in fact the tradition itself is very clear the teacher has nothing more than the student. That the wisdom already exists, we are all born with it. And we die with it, we cannot get rid of it, or to get more the teacher shows you this and the student gradually comes to understand, and the minds are joined. After being married for 17 years, I still sometimes I was lying next to the looking at this and thought: "I have No idea who you are." It was completely impossible to know. You could never predict their reaction to something. Do you love? Talk of love is almost an insult to our relationship because he was treating me as the reincarnation of the Lama that I was recognized. Then in terms of love, we never talk about something like that, I was being treated like a king from another country. He always knew that his intentions were good and I knew that it would be nice but in the background I'm not sure that is what motivated him. When I rode a horse. When I rode a horse Poem of Chogyam Trungpa. When I rode a horse, subject to my chair. When you play with snakes, the button in my wrists. When I play with maidens dangerous, I'll leave you to talk about first. The "Crazy wisdom" as I understand it means not firmly planted your foot in the material world or the spiritual. When we have the point of view of the spiritual world, we are bound by this and when is the materialist, we are bound by their point of view. But if you go beyond that, and give that extra hop then that is the leap to the "crazy wisdom". It is like taking a leap into the abyss but it is not the abyss of the nothing, but the abyss of reality. Would have been able to succeed without commit fully as he did. He was able to have a nice community and a good life, but never thought to their own safety. Bodhisattva: The person who makes the be helpful to the other the principle of their life. How much we have tried to relate to our own heart? And what, of the attempt to relate to him, has been rejected because you could discover something horrible in it? Taught Me so much. All that is on your heart. And taught me to be, genuine, and completely who he was. He was human, fully human, and not hid it. Not hiding his tears, nor his wounds. When we want to relate to our heart... What are you? Who are you? Where is your heart? If you tear through your ribcage with the hand and feel your heart, there is a delicacy. You feel sore and soft. It hurts. And you want to pour your heart to relate with others. That kind of delicacy brings a notion of fearlessness. That fearlessness that shows you possibilities, that the world around you can tickle your heart open. It was his way of saying that it was a form of strength when you feel that delicacy in thee you become more strong. He lived his life as the biggest "bodhisattva" The bodhisattva promises to renounce anything that has to do himself and help others. And that was all he did. "Come on, I'm going to make you cry! That was all he did. I can't believe it! I went to the hospital and had a question about the decoration of a suite on Tower Road, and Rinpoche was dying, and I went to the side of his bed and I thought: "Is that you can't hear me, but I can verbalize my idea and such time to catch some type of response on the issue." And it was as if there was a tv screen and just to see interference in black-and-white. Do you know? It's over. No more questions. A belt of ice fixed covered three-quarters of the port and spread about 8 nautical miles in the sea The ice fixed is common at this time of year, but rarely get to Halifax. The whole sea was frozen and so we felt because he was dying. He opened his eyes and almost joined. They were all waiting for that moment... All understood that he was telling us somehow that until here came. There is a moment in which you feel that you are going to be his last word, and it's going to be for you. All to the expectation. In a moment, we started singing the anthem of Shambhala, I don't know how it started maybe someone I plan to... It was like... It was like... our last offering to him. He opened his eyes and looked around and when the hymn had just breathed a few times. We were attentive to each breath, because we did not know if it would take another. Chogyam Trungpa died in Halifax, nova Scotia on 4 April 1987. Then I went outside and the ice had begun to move and the other day I had nothing, and it was a lot of ice. The sky became blue 3,000 people gathered for the cremation of Chogyam Trungpa. His holiness Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche reaches of the India to conduct the cremation ceremony. The princes of the Kagyu lineage come from Sikkim. I have known teachers who have tried to emulate him and for a few years is fine, but all the years all the time tell me that does not know as he did. Only you can think of or was it madness, or was it "crazy wisdom" was something incredible. Even in a film like this, if the message transmitted is is that the reason out to be defined or formulated in any way that defy the whole purpose of his life, that was afford not to be formulated and fluids and let others open up to their innate goodness. Do you see it? What I see, but I am not convinced that it's something extraordinary. Is around the sun. The rainbow... Something in the clouds. Something in the sky. Tibetan buddhism remains in the west. The books of Trungpa are sold by the millions, and 214 meditation Centers, Shambhala, led by his son Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche, continue the vision of an enlightened society. Can it be possible?
