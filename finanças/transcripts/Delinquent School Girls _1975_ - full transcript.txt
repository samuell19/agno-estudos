As you all know we are nearing a holiday certain students will not be granted permission to leave the campus this evening the following students will report to Miss Nancy Crowley for reassignment to new dormitory rooms please stand when your name is called Madeline Mulligan Carla Gray Penny Archer Greta Anderson Betsy Benton Sandy Turner Miss Sandy Turner I trust you have an excuse for being so late young lady. I'm sorry Mr. Baxter. I was studying my geology lesson and I forgot all about the assembly. That's enough back talk Miss Turner report to Miss Crowley after this assembly. This names I'm about to read off will also remain here. What can I do about it? Mr. Baxter had every right to ask me why I was late it was my own damn fault. He tried to make a fool of you Sandy and I won't stand for it that chauvinist pig better not try it again just because he's the principal doesn't give him any right to talk to you that way. I can't worry about it now. I have to study for that algebra exam. A few good karate chops would show that Baxter we're not the inferior sex by god. Hi Alice. We got the same room. Man, what's happening? Can I have this bed near the window? You're not going any place. Be my guest. Watch that first step it's a long one. Hi. Hi Carol. Jesus and I thought I was big but this is ridiculous. What size are you? Logically 40 D cup. What kind of exercises are you using? I got some great ones look at this. Fantastic. The female has a slightly heavier layer of fat. Since rabbits are in the rodent family their reproduction cycle is very closely akin to that of the common mouse. If you will note the reproductive organ of the male. My, my, my, my, it's it's time to leave, pity, pity, pity. Thank you ladies. Thank you. I know you fancy him Miles really doesn't do anything for me. What do you see in him? Don't ask me why Penny but I think he's really a sexy man. Goddamn Betsy he must be at least 50 years old. I know but he's so sweet he reminds me of my uncle. Probably he's limp as a dish rag give me a stud anytime so we better hurry Greta wants a meeting of all the girls before exercise class. Yes, you're right. Alright girls, listen. This is the last exercise class of the year but we're really gonna teach that Baxter a lesson. What do you got planned Greta? Simple, we're not going to wear our bras to class today. Greta, we can't do that. Baxter will be furious. Right, that's exactly what I want. We'll show that chauvinist pig. Yeah. Miss Crowley. Will you please tell the girls to wear their braziers during their exercises? If one of the members of the board of trustees where to come by it will be quite difficult to explain. Yes Timothy, I'll tell them right after the session. Besides it's for their own good all that bouncing and jiggling it's obscene. I understand Timothy. Miss Crowley I asked you not to be so familiar with me during school hours. I'm sorry Timo... Mr. Baxter. Okay girls that's it for today hit the showers. Hi James. Take me for a ride? I can dig it. I hope you're prepared to deliver the goods today James. Service is our businessman ma'am and we aim to please. Isn't that a chick down there in that vegetable truck? It sure as hell is. It is. It is. Looks like something who is trying to do his thing. Goddamn. Shit. If I was in that truck that little cuz would really have a king-size thrill chances are she couldn't even handle it. It flies out in a fruitcake we're talking about the bottom of the barrel. Look. Look. Are we going over the escape plans? Or are we going to spend all afternoon watching some chick dwarfing? Yes. Yes. I bet he's going to take her off on some dirt road and slam it to it. We'll be out of here in 24 hours, right Carl? You can wait that long, can't you Dickie? I gotta get me a woman. I've been doing without it for long long time. He is he is casually flashing all meat. That could be you in that truck down there. He is. Shit. I bet she'd rather be with me. How she would get a workout. Man, if I'm not the best. Sure, she would like to see just who it is. Now, listen Butch Brothers. This this is how we're going to do it. How are you and our biology teacher Mr. Miles making it? You know, he doesn't even know that I'm alive. Why don't you try to turn on that gym instructor? You know? Big Steve Steel? No, no never. He's too big. What do you mean he's too big? If he ever did anything to me he'd tear me apart. Aside you forget I'm very tiny. A little stretchy never hurt a girl. Besides you'll get a lot more action from him than you would that old man Miles. He looks like he's about to drop dead of a heart attack. Please Penny, I'd rather not talk about it right now. And now the latest news in an arrogant daylight maneuver today 3 convicted sexual deviants escaped from the maximum security ward state asylum the trio was led by Carl C. Clooney a former comic and impersonator with a long history of terrifying people with threats of sexual violence ironically Clooney has never actually harmed any of his victims he was schedule for parole in 6 months authorities are quoted to be amazed that he has escaped as Clooney has appeared to be responding very well to his treatments the two men who broke out with Clooney are also classified as psychotics one is Bruce Wilson a former award winning dress designer Wilson is described as a latent homosexual and is consider psychologically unbalanced he is the last person in the world to your indiscretions have causing me an awful lot of embarrassment at the office only yesterday Mr. Townsend called me to inquire if everything was OK at home. That impotent old windbag? Did you tell him that his wife Sadie has been in a really shady lane motel? Reserved every afternoon for her own private R&R while she knows more sailors than the secretary of the navy. That has nothing to do with our situation Ellie. Ellie. Ellie, you've been in the bourbon again. Yeah. Well, just because you don't drink whiskey ain't no reason why I should do a Dr. Pepper number. Ellie, I wish you wouldn't talk to me that way you ought to give me some respect. Respect? There's a lot more than I get if you could get your mind off the farm just one night we might scare up a little excitement. Sex, sex, sex. You know, that's all you ever talk about. Sex. You know something Ellie? You might consider cleaning this place up a little instead of watching soap operas all day and sitting around half naked. A lot of good it does me I haven't had any in so long I even forgot what it feels like. Well, it don't help none to keep us in this regard Yeah well listen here farmer don't hurt nothing either. As a general rule cold blooded animals are restricted in their reproductive cycles insofar as say while they are entirely at the mercy of the elements and they must depend totally upon solar energy to maintain their body heat at optimum level. Now since the female cannot conceive at temperatures less than My, my, I didn't realize how late it was. We'll pick up on the reproductive cycle of the reptiles at our next class. That'll be all for today ladies. Thank you very much. Goodbye. Betsy, my dear. I wonder if you would mind helping an old man carry some books I'm afraid my old heart isn't as strong as it used to be. How interesting. Over here my dear thank you for helping an old man with his burden perhaps a glass of iced tea would do nicely on such a warm day, don't you think? That sounds wonderful Mr. Miles. Fine, fine, just look around now, why don't you? How beautiful. Here you are Betsy. Your collection is wonderful. I have so much more in storage. You know biology is my favorite subject my roommate and I talk about you all the time. It isn't wise to gulp liquid so rapidly especially on such a warm day. I'm sorry Mr. Miles, I guess I was really thirsty. All things in moderation my dear. Gosh, I shouldn't have gulped that iced tea all at once. I'm feeling a little bit dizzy It'll pass. It'll pass my child. It looks as though you're getting quite sleepy. Are you sure you're feeling alright? I feel fine. You will notice that the eagle has a dilated pupil when you look directly into it you might imagine a bottomless pit your eyelids are getting quite heavy. Heavy? Heavy? Drowsy eyelid. You will relax until I say the word shipwreck when you awaken you will leave this cottage and completely forget having been here until then you will do exactly as I say. Carl Clooney was once a very talented mimic and impersonator when his booking was cancelled at the Palace Theater his mind suddenly snapped and he went berserk Clooney was definitely termed as a leader and instigator of the escape in addition to Clooney the trio consisted of Richard Peters a former professional baseball player Richard "Big" Dick Peters convicted of indecent exposure and rape no less than seven times in the past ten years citizens in a radius of 50 miles are warned to be on the lookout for these three men roadblocks have been set up on all roads leading into and out of the county every available officer has been called into the search for the three escape lunatics. We must repeat these men are exceptionally dangerous and all citizens are warned to contact the nearest sheriff's office in the event these men are spotted. It's terribly warm in here Betsy. Why don't we remove some of those heavy clothes? You must remember to forget. Is this how Daniel Boone became famous? Are you sure we're on the right way Clooney? If you guys don't stop yapping I'm going to take you back to the looney bin. Promises. Promises. I'm sorry Ellie. Now, back to the weather. The weather promises to remain the same for the next several days as the heatwave continues temperatures were extremely high today for the fourteenth consecutive day farmers in the upstate area are in danger of severe crop loss unless there is a break in temperatures soon lows tonight will be exceptionally high and the highs tomorrow will be even higher the mercury saw to its highest reading at approximately 2 pm this is your weather girl Simon saying I'll be with you tomorrow night, on time. What do you see? I see a fat old man in the chair and I think he's asleep. She's gotta be soaking wet I want to give her the real thing. I want to give her the time of her life. It might be a trap. What's the old man doing now? He's over in the corner and he's definitely asleep. Goddamn. I haven't been this hard in a year. Don't worry, you'll get your quiff. Dick. Wait. One wrong move old man and I'll break your arm. Alright farmer let's go check out the vibrator action. What a dump. Hello baby. What do you want? I'll call the police. Frankly, I don't give a damn Scarlet. Now, you lay in bed and be quiet. Don't worry lady I got something that's really good for you. If you touch her I'm going to kill you. The keys give me the keys to the truck. Thank you. Wilson. You hold the keys, I'm gonna check this place out. Dickie you start without me the plantations is all yours. You turn me loose you bastard. I'll take you both on one at each time. Get him out of here Bruce while I give this little lady a thrill. You better be nice to her Dickie. I'll be very upset with you if you do something she doesn't like. Don't worry about a thing Brucie boy just keep the old man away from me while I do his woman proper. No please you wouldn't dare Earl do something. Get ready baby. If Earl comes here he'll kill you. What you're talking about? Just lie back and relax you're about to get the best in the west. So what should I do with this huge load? Put him on the chair so we keep an eye on him. What's the sex freak doing? Yes. Sounds like he's killing it. I'm a married woman, don't you understand? Yeah momma I understand just lie back and enjoy it. He's had a pretty rough time, alright. Carl, what a divine outfit. Thank you. I think I need to get a drink. Goodnight Tammy Wynette. It's Randolph Scott. This is possibility indecent. You're damn right. Look what that obnoxious horse is doing it, it's quite positively obscene. Earl, you aren't watching. That's dumb Randolph. A piano? Girl you're such fancy. Brucie boy. The nectar of the gods. Old timer this will make you feel better come on have a drink, you'll feel better. You'll feel really good man, that's it. Now, you'll gonna be alright. Splendid, simple splendid. Earl this vermin is like a vicious animal. What's that animal doing to poor Ellie? Sounds fine with me. I think he's such a demented boy when he says he's going to get some he gets it. I can't fight anymore Earl he's so big. That's it seven years without is much too long. Can you take it baby? I swear I'm gonna kill both of you. Come on, here have a drink. Go ahead. Goddamn anything this good can't be bad. It feels so good don't stop. You believe what those nuts at the White House are doing? They are ruining our country. Sex, sex, sex. It's all she ever thinks of I haven't had a good night's sleep in years. I'm still gonna kill you. My son Carl is not a bad boy. He just likes a little fun. He's just a born practical joker and likes to scare people but he never ever hurt anyone in his whole life. Why? He wouldn't even hurt a fly. Maybe just scare it a little. Will you boys mind do me a little favor? It's showtime, what is it? Will you lock me in the closet? And then tell Ellie that I just put up one hell of a battle in her honor. What a marooned. If you do that for me I won't kill you. Okay old timer but first one more chorus. They sure beat the hell out those four guards. And you have no idea which way they're heading? No sir. It's anybody's guess where they went. They sound like really rough men. Yeah. There's no telling what they'd do if they spot a whole school yard full of women. Well, most of the campus will be empty because of a holiday. After tomorrow though there'll only be a dozen girls and I've got them all together in one section of the dorm. We won't be far away if you need us Mr. Baxter. Thank you officer. I certainly hope I don't have to make that call. That was a good demonstration of the backstroke at this time we'll give the breaststroke a try and please no jokes. Alright girls on your marks get ready get set. Here comes Timothy Tight-ass. Miss Crowley I'd like to talk to you for a moment. How come he never smiles? I don't know but he better not try anything with Sandy. What would he do? Do you think? Whatever it is, he better just forget it. Don't worry about him. He's only interested in Miss Crowley. Do you think he and her are? Greta, what have you been teaching this girl? He wish to turn back strong a couple of those zappers. Greta. Would you please have them do some freestyle? I'll be right back girls. Yes Miss Crowley. One, two, three, go. I just talked to the state highway patrol they haven't recaptured those three men who escaped from the insane asylum. They've got roadblocks set up everywhere, haven't they? Yes Miss Crowley it's only a matter of time but my responsibility is to these girls. Very well. Would you like me to cancel the karate classes tonight Dr. Baxter? No That won't be necessary no reason to create a panic unnecessarily. Listen, I've got an idea. Why don't you come along and learn some basic karate moves? No, no. I'll be back at 9 pm escort the girls back to the dormitory you should be finished by then. That farmer was so dumb. Can you imagine wanting to be locked in a closet? I think he's a closeted gay. Well, you didn't have to slap the woman like that. She shouldn't have called me a lesbian I don't have to take that from any silly bitch, it's her own problem. I think she liked it. She's a first class freakier. Was I ready Clooney? What do I know? She sure was a screamer. Slow this stagecoach down a bit. I think I'm getting sick to my stomach with all this whiz and bouncing. Sure partner, may I just pull over in the main road? Or stop in a motel so you can get some rest? He's right Clooney, you better slow down this road is getting worse and worse. Anytime you guys want to slow down just open the door and jump on I driving this rig and I'm not stopping for nothing, you get me? What's wrong Clooney? We're out of gas meat-head. Shit. You mean you never checked the gauge? Sure, sure May West after I got the gun, the knife, the whip and the hat. It was the next thing on my list. I'll tell you what you see sex and sin plane and simple the devil has taken over the entire world topless dancers pornographic films dirty magazines group sex I can go on and on but friends the handwriting is on the wall the eternal fires of damnation are waiting for sex sinners. To keep this ministry going please send your contributions to the ministry of peace Tulsa, Okla... State Police Chief Chester Atkins reported that they made off with the farmer's pickup truck it's described as a red and white 1972 Ford unfortunately the farmer was far too intoxicated to recall the license number of the vehicle Chief Atkins has alerted the entire... You know some? You guys want to know something? The hell I'm gonna tell you anyhow I want me some pussy. All citizens are warned to be on the lookout for these three men do not try to apprehend them alone repeating that number once again 8443000 that's 8443000 What do you think Carl? I think it'd be wise to lay low right here moving across that open space wouldn't exactly be wise. What kind of buildings are those? They look like a college or a hospital or something. Damn I'm starved. How long would you think it'll be before it gets dark? A couple hours maybe. Well, I can't wait that long. I'm too damn hungry. You guys ran through the goddamn forest like Tarzan and we gotta get some food. How about you Nancy? I suppose your belly is stretching your ass too. Well, to tell you the truth darling food wouldn't be such a bad idea but I didn't wear myself out with that douche-bag last night. That Ellie got some great poon tang, pussy-boy. To tell you the truth against my better judgment but I'm a little hungry myself. There doesn't seem to be anybody around. That don't mean shit it could be a trap and I don't feel like walking into an old goddamn trap. Will you tell me one thing Carl? Have you ever been accused of being paranoid? I say let's take a chance. Thank god they're gone. I'm starving. I'm glad you're still alive. Petite pâtés? You want my sweet Christmas pie? I never touch that stuff. Have you a serviette? Goddamn this chow's great. Not bad. Not bad. Not bad? It's better than Howard Johnson's. This is Mr. Baxter those student who have abided by the rules and regulations have left for the holiday I want to take a moment to advice all of you who are remaining on campus that there'll be no change in our regular schedules uniforms will be worn as usual and with the proper degree of modesty meals will be served at the appointed hours and of course all lights will be turned off promptly at 10 pm. What is this dump anyway? Well, like a goddamn prison to me. Yeah. Another frying pan of fire. Let's get the hell out of here. Wait a minute, I've not finished yet. Yeah, use two hands meat-head. Several of the faculty have volunteered to remain on campus and will be available for consultation. Put the food down. These girls are amazons. You. You. We must endeavor to maintain high standards at all times Fucking amazon.

Now, those snakes are non poisonous although they closely resemble the rattlesnake they are perfectly harmless but I'll bet I'll bet that they could really scared the Dickens out of somebody who didn't know the difference. Mr. Miles you know so much about so many things. You're the smartest man I've ever met. No, I wouldn't say that or doctor Baxter could hear you. That eagle is so beautiful.

Excellent. Excellent. Who is this Baxter fella you've been talking about? He's the principal. Principal? Principal of what? What is this place? It's a school for girls and he's the principal. Well, the administrator actually. I see. Goddamn. Let's get out of this dump with a little luck we could find a school for boys. And leave all of this? You gotta be kidding me Brucie. No, no, no, no, I don't trust them they could be lying, I think we should lock them up. I'm sorry ladies, it's going to be a slightly inconvenience. Where man?
