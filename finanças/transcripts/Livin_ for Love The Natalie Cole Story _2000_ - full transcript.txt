Daddy. - Natalie, daddy's entertaining, let's go. - Have a good night, sweetie. - Goodnight. - Jack, what could be so important on Christmas Eve. - Your ratings are solid, your guests are top drawers. Nat, your show has been a real ground breaker and NBC's been proud to carry it. - But? - We can't find a sponsor. We've been to every national advertiser twice. Nobody wants the show. - So, you're saying no one wants a colored host? America's afraid of the dark. Well I don't believe that. With so many white folks watching this show, somebody will come through. - Howard, if Capital Records picks up part of the tab, they don't call it the house that Nat built for nothing. - I'm sorry. We've explored all the options. The network just can't afford to carry the show without a national sponsor. I'm sorry. - Any other show of this caliber would be fighting off the sponsors. Nat, maybe if we hired a white co host then the network might... - Maria. - What are we going to do? - I go back on the road.

My sister, Cookie, and I wanted to but that wasn't my family's approach. When we buried my father, we each took that grief and stuffed it into a little closet, deep, way deep inside and locked the door and somehow, somehow we expected it to stay put. - Natalie, Natalie, please. - Mom.

Please forgive me, I was just worried that you were still talking about... - Singing. - Yes. - Well mom, you were a singer. - Yes, but I gave up my career for your father. Your father was an incredible talent. He just needed someone to help him navigate to a higher society. You see, a singing career is as much about an image as it is about music. He had the voice and I had the polish. I still do. Which is why one singer in this family is enough. - You don't know my mom, she'll freak. - So what?

Jesus name. - In Jesus name. - Amen. - amen. - I know. It seems too good to be true but it was. I mean I had everything I ever wanted and when life is really going great, what do you do? You find a way to screw it up. ♪ Where can you go ♪ ♪ When you're loving just to love ♪ - You can play that one. Hey! - I love the new album. ♪ We've all been there before ♪ - Hey I'm glad you could make it hey girl. ♪ But no matter how I'm feeling ♪ - Natalie Cole, disco lady. Is there anything you can't sing? You ain’t never done this? - Uh huh. - Come on, try it. It will make you feel a lot clearer and a whole lot more creative, too. - Okay. How do you do this? - Just snort it, baby. - It's a nice little buzz. Goes good with Champagne. Come on reverend, its your turn. Oh that's it. Okay reverend. - Gentlemen, I apologize for the delay. It won't be too much longer now. - Chuck. - Kevin, where have you been? - What do you mean where have I been? - She's been in there all day. She won't listen to me anymore. You need to handle this. - Oh man. Natalie honey, come on Natalie... - Natalie, come on! - Hey hey. Natalie. why didn't you call me sooner? - I've been calling you all day. Where have you been? - What do you mean where have I been? - You knew this was a big day for us - I can't work with that guy. - What guy? - That guy behind the soundboard. He doesn't know crap. Chuck, he's like 19 years old. He's a little smart ass, Kevin. We are professionals, okay. We need professional technicians... - Well this is shaping up into a nice little disaster. Does our friend have her drugs in there? - What, what did you just say? - Get him out of my face! - Marvin, Marvin forget it. - Don't be talking about my woman like that. - Get him. - She ain’t on those drugs, man. - What's wrong with you, come on. Come on. - I'm really sorry about that, you know but you got it wrong about Natalie. You know, just a little bit stressed out and we had a couple of technical... - Shut up! Do you know how much this is costing the company? Now if your client doesn't have her drugs get them for her. Get her high and get her out here singing before I pull the plug. - How you doing, honey? - Bang. - Bang bang. - Bang. - Bang bang. - Bang bang. - Bam bam. - Bye, money. - Hey Robbie, hey little man. - Bye, mister. - So Marvin, you know, what's going on with him? - He keeps getting on my case about cleaning up this house and he said he's gonna take my baby if I don't stop getting high. But see, he knows, he knows how much I love Robbie. Hell, he's getting high and he's a preacher. - Damn. - Right now he's probably standing up in a pulpit in Chicago talking to people about how to get their lives together after he was getting high all night. - I think you need to relax. - Now that's why I like you. - That's why I like you, too. all aboard, captain. Choo Choo. - Robbie! I don't have time for games. Robbie! Robbie! Robbie! Natalie! I can't swim. Natalie! Oh my god, I can't swim. Natalie! Robbie almost drowned in the pool! - What? Oh my god! Dru! Oh Robbie. I'm sorry, baby. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Oh god. - Why'd the hell you even have a child if you were just gonna let the help raise it? - No we had a child, Marvin and where in the hell where you huh? You spend more time in Chicago with that damn church than you do in your own home. - Home, what home? How can you call this a home? You're not even around half the... Mommy, mommy. - I want a divorce. - Yeah okay. - I know it was nuts. In a split second, my marriage was over but that's addiction. You see it overwhelms every sane idea and impulse that you've ever had and reinforces all the crazy ones. From here on out, it's all downhill. Natalie Cole fries in hotel fire. - Lord if you don't want me to get high then send your angels. - Let's go, you're okay. You're okay. - Cookie, please talk some sense into your sister. - I'm scared, Natalie. You almost died. That's a wake up call. You need help. I know you're under lots of pressure and I know you didn't mean for it to get so bad but it did and you need to do something about it now. You know that, don't you? - Don't you know what people are saying? Don't you care? Think about your son. Think about your family, Natalie. This is not just yourself that your destroying. It's all of us, Natalie. Or are you too far gone to see that? You need to get help. - Your mothers filed suit to take over your finances, Natalie and speaking as your business manager I think its a good idea. You have hardly anything in the bank. Kevin, Kevin can hardly get you booked anymore. In fact, I think you need a new manager. I think Dan Cleary can get you working again but only after you get your life together. - Alright. I'll do it. In rehab I had to learn and relearn the true meaning of life and then one day, before I left this girl came to me and she said, did you know I just realized who you are? And its when she said that to me that I, I just realized who I was. - Wow. - And then I said, you know what? It's time for me to go. - Well it was time. You were ready. - Yeah and that's why its so great for me to be sitting here and talking about it. I've done all the damage to myself. - What was I saying? I've done all the damage to myself. What a joke. I came out of that rehab as messed up as ever. Now Kevin and I parted ways, which was for the best but I'd given up on me. But god never gave up. - We care about you Natalie, we're afraid you're gonna lose your life. - Capitol dumped you. Now Epic won't renew your contract because your album for them was a disaster. Nobody will work with you. Your reputation is killing your career and I can't save it. Where's your son? - Robbie's um, he's with Dru. - But where, doing what? - Dan. - You don't know, do you? What's gonna happen to him if you die? - Natalie, there's a center in Minnesota, Hazleden. They have an excellent rehab program. - I tried rehab and it didn't work. - No, you didn't work. What are you looking for? - Gum. Screw this. Driver. - yeah. - Turn around, we're gonna go back. - No. Keep driving. - You know what, Dan? You're about this close to getting fired. You alright back there? - Of all the dumb, stupid ideas. Obviously we need to go back home and reevaluate this thing. - No! No, we're gonna walk to the nearest gas station and get some help. - No you're going to the gas station, I'm getting back in the car. - No, you're not. You're gonna stay right here where I can see you. - You are so fired, Dan Cleary. You are fired! - I was sobbing like I've never sobbed not in my adult life and then I uh, I just woke up. - How do you feel about that, Natalie, about Sarah's dream? - Let me just say this about rehab, its tough. At first, its like getting your teeth pulled with no Novocaine. - I remember heroin withdrawal it was sheer hell for like a week, then it was over. But coke, so much worse. - And the last thing you want to do is talk. - When I started out it was fun. - Is it still fun? - No. - So why do it? - I want to - The work of therapy is to peel away your layers of denial and anger. Its like peeling an onion. - I don't get a high, I feel like hell. I can't think. - What are you thinking about when you're high, Natalie? - Eventually you get to the pain, that's why you shot up and snorted and smoked yourself into oblivion in the first place, to avoid the pain. So you could feel nothing. So when you start getting sober, you start feeling again. - I wrote my son a letter. His nanny wrote me back and said he took my letter and stood in the corner like he'd done something wrong. Blamed himself, he didn't blame me. When I think about how I let him down and everybody else. - How have you let them down? - Well lets see, um. I broke up my family. Marvin went and married somebody else. Screwed up my career. - So who have you hurt the most? I don't think you've really dealt with his death yet. Did you grieve? - Of course I grieved. I didn't wallow in it. I mean you can't go on with your life if you're wrapped up in self pity. - Grief is not self pity. - Then what is it? - Its the process of accepting your loss. If you don't grieve, if you push down that pain, you may seem fine on the outside but inside, you're an emotional time bomb. I don't blame you for being scared of the pain, Natalie. But you have to face it and you're not alone. - I thought I was gonna break, I didn't want to feel that much pain, it was horrible. I didn't want to miss my dad, that much. I guess that's why I put it off for so long. - I resented my mom for not being there for me when I was growing up. My dad wasn't there either but I gave him excuses. I just, I laid all the blame on her. - So maybe you've been unfair to her? she won't do it she doesn't want to participate in your therapy with you. - She'll sign the check but she won't help me heal. - I'm sorry. - Do you know she didn't even tell me that my father was dying? Never even Gave me a chance to say goodbye? What would you call a woman like that? - Human. So terrified of losing the man who defined her life that she couldn't face the truth. For a long time, it was so much easier to blame my mother than to try and understand her, forgive her, accept her, love her as a woman with fears and faults just like me. ♪ I never thought ♪ ♪ I'd ever make it ♪ ♪ I can't believe ♪ ♪ The hell I've been through ♪ ♪ Couldn't see the light ♪ ♪ At the end of the tunnel ♪ ♪ I didn't know what to do ♪ ♪ I've been through the rain ♪ ♪ I've been through the fire ♪ ♪ There was something that I never knew ♪ ♪ I had an angel on my shoulder ♪ ♪ With a path for me ♪ ♪ Divine ♪ ♪ Must be an angel on my shoulder ♪ - Am I still fired? - How's Robbie? - Oh good. - Yeah? - yeah. - I got him and Dru moved into your new place in Studio City.

But I have put the feelers out and as soon as you're ready, I'll start booking you. Small gigs at first, out of the limelight until you get your chops back. - Dan, I haven't even sung a note in six months. I don't even know if I can sing again. I put on all this weight. - Natalie, look it won't be easy, I know but when you're fighting your old reputation and its always harder for a woman than it is for a man. But I know you can do it, Natalie. I know it. Like I said, its small but its nice. You have great neighbors. Surprise! I've got concert dates booked. Natalie, there's just one thing. I've been talking with all the major labels. None of them want to move forward. - What? Without an audition. - What! They want to audition you. I told you it wouldn't be easy to fight your reputation. - Dan, I have Grammys. I have gold records. I know. - I'm not auditioning for nobody. Natalie, I'm sorry. - Mommy. Mommy. - Baby. You got a boo boo. Come here. It's gonna be okay. Close your eyes. Its gonna be fine.

Oh you guys need some serious work. - Hey, mom. - I don't need any work. Robbie, go get your bag. So how'd it go? - Well, Mercury's not the only record label in town, you know? - Yeah well, I wish I could stay but I got to get back for my Wednesday night. - Oh I remember. Deacon's meeting. - Yeah. - yeah. - So, how's married life? - Its up and down. I miss you, Natalie. I've been trying to remember. I know we were messed up but what were we thinking? - We weren't. I wasn't. Otherwise I would of never let you go. - You ready to go boy? Let's get out of here. Mr. Cleary, are you still holding? - Yes, yes I'm still holding. - I'm sorry, Mr. Lemp is still in a meeting. - Dan? Hey. Did they see me? Hello, Mr. Cleary? - Did I get my contract in Manhattan or what? Mr. Cleary, are you still there? - He never showed. I'm sorry, Natalie. Bruce, your guy never showed. Natalie sang her heart out and your guy wasn't there to hear it. - Oh it was probably just a misunderstanding. - I hope so. I hope he didn't blow her off because of some crap rumor that she's still a junkie. I hope that he took this assignment as seriously as you seemed to when we agreed that this was her audition. - Jerry? - Look, I was on the freeway. I nearly had an accident. What can I say? God told me to turn back. - Well gods been talking to me, too and he said you better give Natalie a two album deal. Ms. Cole, I really love your new album. Thank you so much for autographing it for me. - Okay. Thank you. Thanks. - Hey momma, I got a new car. - Hey guys. What? Dru. What am I gonna do with you? Hey Dan. - Natalie. - How's it going? - I just talked to Chuck. - How is he? How is he? - Natalie, Marvin died this afternoon of a heart attack. I'm so sorry. - Oh. - Are you okay? - Yeah. Just give me a minute. Honey. Sweetie. - Mom. - Sweetie, um. Your daddy died today. - I just talked to him on the phone. Oh my babies. - You don't have to try to be brave. If you want to cry its okay. I'll even cry with you. - I love you, mom. - I love you, too, Rob. I love you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.

So if you try something new, you might lose your audience. - Why not record one of your dads songs on your next pop album? Give it a funky beat. That could work. - Yeah - I just want to do a tribute album to my father. - Well, that might be possible if say you had another hit record. Or two. Two solid pop albums and then you can do this little jazz thing of yours. - Going off on a tangent at this point will kill your career. - Exactly, okay? Thanks for your time. If you need anything, you know how to get ahold of me. Oh and Dan, always a pleasure. You coming? - Damn suits. Dan, all they care about is the bottom line. - Natalie, they do have a point. Audiences love to put their entertainers in a box. Break out of that box, they might not let you back in. - Yeah, I know. But I have spent my entire career trying not to be defined as the daughter of Nat King Cole. - I know. - But the truth is, I wouldn't be where I am without him. I owe him. And Dan I don't care if it hurts my career. I need to do this. - Say we can get out of the contract with AMI, we'll still need a label that can back us up. Have you ever met Bob Krasnow? - A tribute album? - Look Bob, we're just so grateful that you could see us so soon after your surgery. I mean if you want to a pin in this until... - Natalie Cole sings Nat King Cole. - Well yeah. What's your favorite song? - Its hard to say. Its hard to whittle it down to just one. - Exactly and I mean just think of how many people have fallen in love with Dad's music over the years. Its timeless. - Okay. You can have you contract with Alektra but we need to talk about producers and songs. You can't touch the arrangements of Paper Moon and Unforgettable. - Well actually, Mr. Krasnow, I was thinking Unforgettable, I could sing it as a duet. - Who's singing the other part? - My dad. - It was a lovely wedding, really. It was just a bit, well ostentatious. These Hollywood couplings usually are. What is so funny, young lady? What's so funny? - Nothing mom, its just nice to see you. It's been awhile. - Yes it has. We both lead full lives. I'm just a phone call away, Natalie. We do better long distance, don't you think? I have to tell you, I really do like the short hair. It's very chic. - Thanks. - So uh. How is the new album coming? - Its fine mom, just fine. - You know this is going to change your life. - You don't want me to do it? - I didn't say I don't want you to do it although I do remember you telling me once that you never wanted to compete for your fathers name. - What I said was I wanted to be a singer in my own right and now I am. - Which is why I don't understand you're inviting comparisons is dangerously foolish. - Mother please. - This is stupid. - Oh please, mother. - and its foolish. - Mother, mother. Mom. I need your help. I want to do an Unforgettable video. The director needs footage, we need some home movies on dad. If possible. - I don't have any. - And you don't think you could find some? - I think you should speak to Cookie. Now I really have to go, Natalie. I have some people waiting for me at the hotel for dinner. - Mom. Mom, I don't want to compete with anyone. I never wanted to, never. See you. - Goodbye, Natalie. Bye, Natalie. - Mom? - I can't stay. I don't want to miss my flight. Natalie, you remember your godfather, Sam? His son was always running around sticking that movie camera into everybody's face? Well I remembered that he saves everything. I phoned him. He brought over some footage of your father. You know your father, he recorded in this very studio. - I know, mom. Why don't you stay? - I can't stay. I'll miss my plane. - Mom. Johnny. You know what I'd really like to do? I'd like to try this out here with the orchestra. Is that okay?
