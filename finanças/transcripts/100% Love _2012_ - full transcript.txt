Hey, did you watch Bodyguard? - Yes. On Tuesday. - How is it? Yes, it is good. It is really nice. When will I get to see it? - Hey, you can watch it anytime. It is going to run for a long time. - What is it? You started it here too? This boy is so handsome, right? Hey, he just looks good. - Meaning? He hasn't been able to get a job till date. I see him standing here on the bus stand everyday.. ..from where he goes to look for a job everyday. Hey, yes. You have a job. There is nothing to worry about. Carry on. - Hey, come on. Should I waste my life by carrying on with him? Come on. What? - Destiny! What? You have been looking for a job since ten years. You haven't found even one yet? You are working. Looking for a job is also work. You couldn't answer even one question correctly. Your profile doesn't match ours. How can you get a job nowadays if you can't speak in English? Sorry. - Sorry. Sorry. - Sorry. "This person is a loser. He is lucky he is a loser." "Nowhere to go. He is a loser." Rahul, I have got a job. Yes. The Kejriwal job. You know, the salary is good. "Sitting all alone." Hey, Rahul. Come in. - Come. "Nowhere to go. And nobody's here." - So, how are you? "Going round in circles." "Reaching nowhere." "Running up the mountain. Out of my breath." "You got to back it.." "You try any harder and you will get nowhere." "Searching for life in a closed tunnel." "Running, running, running, oh fallen angel." "The person is a loser." "He is lucky he is a loser." No, I don't want to go.. - Come on. Please let go.. - You have to go. Hey, let go.. - Hey, you will be as useless as him.. ..if you don't go to school. What brother? You are going for an interview? There is no point. - Hey! What is it? Are you going for an interview again? Hey listen. Get me two packets to cigarettes from Prabhu's shop. What? - You can keep rupees two for yourself. Hey, don't show off rupees two. We need someone younger. Sorry uncle. I told him many times not to do it. But he didn't listen to me at all. "I don't know what is it..." "If that is the kohl..." It is better to sleep on the footpath rather than coming to this house. Uncle. Even Rahul hasn't had anything since evening. Oh no. This is what happens when you have a local drink. Hey. Care for some tea? No one is forcing you if you don't want it. Okay. There was food kept in the house. Did Abhi keep it? Hey teacher. I want rupees 100. I have to buy application form. I don't have it. Why are you lying? Fine. I won't give. - Why? It is my money and my wish. Wasn't I watching it? It is my T.V. Oh no. Can a human being stay in this house? Human being? You? Who said so? So? Am I a dog? Even dogs listen to human beings. You can speak as much as you want. Let me get the job. Then I will teach you a lesson. Yes, I can see that. A useless boy is sitting and dreaming. Hey, party school master? What have you done in life? Yes? Since the last thirty years, you have only.. ..been thrashing your students. He doesn't have the capacity to give rupees hundred. And then he is preaching? I have been suffering you since the last thirty years. Is that a small feat? You don't have enough money to buy your underwear. And then you have the guts to talk. When sons grow up, they take care of their parents. Hey, boys of your age have taken up.. ..jobs and have a family by now. And you? You are still living off your father.. ..and having food for free. Useless! Thank God I had the job. I can still stand with my head upright. Or else, I would have had to beg on the streets a long time back. Do you know the number of times I have to go to the doctor? I have cataract in my eyes. I can't stand for long due to pain in my knees. My blood sugar level is above 400. What else? When I die, at least come for my cremation. What more can I expect from a boy like you? Here is your rupees 100. Buy the application form if you wish to. Or else, indulge in drinking. Or blow it up on a girl. Disgusting! Hey! What? What? Will you die if you touch me? Yes. - Hey! Will you die? Are you going to office? Yes. - Sorry. Sorry. Go. "With a lot of dreams in my fist." "Life was colorless. I was lost." "You came as a ray of light." "I changed." "I have kept awake on so many nights." "I have counted days." "In the hope of dawn." "I have just practiced. And made songs." "That is why you have come today." "That is why you have come today." "That is why you have come today." "With a lot of dreams in my fist." "Life was colorless. I was lost." "I know at this sudden moment." "There is confusion around us." "And yet, there is a hope in my life." "If my wishes were like a river of the mountain." "Friend, I would have made you flow in them." "I have kept awake on so many nights." "I have counted days." "In the hope of dawn." "I have just practiced. And made songs." "That is why you have come today." "That is why you have come today." "That is why you have come today." "I have never understood myself like this ever." "That is why I have taken this challenge again." "I will never lose again." "Please know that this is the truth." "This is my promise to you." "I have kept awake on so many nights." "I have counted days." "In the hope of dawn." "I have just practiced. And made songs." "That is why you have come today." "That is why you have come today." "That is why you have come today." "With a lot of dreams in my fist." "Life was colorless. I was lost." "You came as a ray of light." "I changed." Wow! Is the world rotating backwards? Here. Hey! Coming. Coming. Let me study. What are you saying? Where are you.. - Where are you coming? To you, dear. I am coming to you after finishing this chapter. Okay? What? Are you drunk again? Disgusting. Does anyone drink all that? Let me study, please. Okay? This is too much. This boy has lost his mind completely. Hi. I am Anuradha. Anuradha. Anuradha. Wow. Anuradha! Welcome to Software Solutions. Mr. Bhowmick will explain the details to you. What? She said it so well, right? Excuse me. - Yes? Any problem? The same problem. I know this. But I can't remember it at the moment. Relax. Don't worry. Think with a calm head. You will get it. Madam. Okay. Thanks madam. Is he joking with me? What is Bishwanath? What happened? No. I mean, Khoka said that he has passed in the written exam. Only group discussion and interview is left. He can't do anything. He is lying again. Don't trust him. Yes. - Yes. Yes, even I feel that. FDI of 27% is a great boost to India. Due to software agreement, tourism and trade develop. Transparency International says.. ..that India is one of the most corrupt countries. Goldmine Bank report says.. ..India will become Super Power in the next 20 years. Yes. She is right. India is the third fastest economic growing country in the world. What? Yes, yes. Yes, yes. Now internet has reached even remote villages. Inflation is becoming very high. Good. - Yes, yes. India, China and Russia share two thirds of the global growth. Yes. - I agree with her. Yes, yes, yes. Actually the point is.. - Wait. Yes? - But still there is.. Now you talk. Yes. Yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Say something other than saying yes, yes, yes, yes. Quiet. Mr. Rahul. What? Actually I can't speak fluently in English. Then speak in Bengali. It is important to talk in a group discussion. Not the language. Is it a shame to talk in Bengali? Talk in Bengali. All of us are Bengalis. No problem. Don't waste time. Muster courage and speak. Be confident. The biggest strength of India is the human capital. Education has really helped human capital. And for that development, we have been.. ..able to do very well overseas in software. This talent has been helpful in our yearly development.. ..and worth mentioning. And at the moment, our economic state has been elevated.. ..because of this talent. It is a good point. What happened now, brother? He has passed in Group discussion too. Wow. - Wow. Wow.. - Hey, wait, wait, wait. Good. - The personal interview is left. He says he is feeling nervous. He wants me to go there. Is everything over? - No. The personal interview is left. I see. It is still left? I don't think you will be able to do it. No, that has been your routine. Then let us do something. Come on, let us not waste time and go home. Will you keep quiet? Hey, talk politely. Didn't you think of this when you called me here? You? Who called you here? Hey, didn't you say that you were feeling lonely and nervous here? And that you would be happy if someone was with you. And I did mean someone. But not you. Oh no. I feel like opening my footwear and hit myself. I just left my work and came here without a reason. Sorry, you can't do that. You are wearing shoes today. - What? Hey, I will teach you.. - Quiet. Go and take it from Mr. Mitra.. - Yes, yes. Good evening, madam. Good evening. My father, madam. My father. Hello. Say hello. Why are you staring at her? Say hello. Hey, she is going away. Say hello. Hey.. - Hello madam, excuse me. Yes. Has he really passed in two exams? - What? Madam... It is nothing madam. Please go. Go, go, go. Yes. Yes. Okay, don't you have brains? Don't you know what to talk about in front of people? You like proving me useless in front of people, right? You were... You were useless once. I knew of that. Have you managed to pass in even one exam in the last ten years? Then all of a sudden I came to know.. ..that you have passed in two exams in such a big company. I had a doubt. That is why.. - You are... Rahul Mazumdar. - Yes. Come in. - Yes. I shouldn't see you here when I come back. I have seen your face before going in. Do you think I will get the job now? Hello. Thank you. What are the programs you know? Programs... Tell me, how Mac works? What are the security tools you have used? What are the programming languages are you using? Haven't you been selected? Okay, forget it. Don't be sad. It is okay if you didn't get this job. You don't have to be upset. It is good that you have come so far based on your own efforts. Come on. Let us go home. Father. I have got the job, father. Your useless son is not unemployed anymore, father. Will you have tea, father? Father. This side. I see. At the beginning, they will pay me fifteen thousand. After six months of training.. ..they will give me twenty five thousand a month. They can even send me abroad for training. After waiting for so long, at the end. I will buy a nice watch for you. Father, retire now. You have become old. And apart from that, I will work now. You stay at home and rest. Stop. - What? I am asking you to stop the scooter. What happened, father? Hey. Hey. What happened, father? How dare you.. - What happened, father? Hey.. - Stop. Why are you hitting me? How dare you say that to me? Oh no. What did I say? Have you lost your mind or something? I haven't lost my mind. You have become extra smart. Have you become a hero? How dare you ask me to retire? I have to sit at home and rest. Why? Should I make tea and breakfast for you? Should I wash your clothes? Should I beg for money from you everyday? Listen, Bishwanath Mazumdar has never bowed down to anyone. Till the time I can, I will live with my prestige intact. The day I fail to do so, I will hang myself. Right! He wants to keep me as a servant. Forget talking to you, I don't even want to see your face. Give it. - Go. Asking me to retire! - What did I say to the old man? Hey teacher. Hey! What did I say? People retire when they become old. They want to rest.. - The same thing again? Fool! Useless! Rogue. Wait, I will teach you a lesson. - Hey. Let me see. - Hey, what are you doing? Hey, hey, I will get hurt. Hey, hey, hey, I think the old man has gone mad. Hey teacher. Hey, take your scooter. - You take it. Hey teacher. 'If we see the life of Rajnikanth...' 'If there is a lot of news about...' 'That story was all about...' "Without you lover, I am restless in this world." I have got a job. I have got a job. Salary of fifteen thousand. You will again have to beg of me for hundred rupees for 100 rupees. It is your first day at work. Your mother would have done everything.. ..if she would have been alive. Let it be. Bless you. All the best. If you can, go to the temple while going. Greetings, sir. What is that on your forehead? - What? I see. It is a dot of vermillion, sir. Of God. Will taking God's name do your work? - What? Or will God come and do your work? No, I.. - Is this a temple or a religious abode? This is an office. Wipe it off. You look like a magic sage. Yes, sir. Useless. All the useless ones have been recruited here. Come on. New trainee, sir. Hello, sir. What is this? - What? This is your first day here at work. - What? And yet it doesn't seem you have been to the temple even once. Actually people of your generation have.. ..stopped believing in veneration. Even I was saying the same thing, sir. Hey.. - Okay. Assign him to Anuradha. - Okay, sir. Anuradha? Thank you. Thank you very much, sir. You are... I mean... Sir. Madam. Your trainee. Your name? What is your name? Have you forgotten, madam? Don't you remember? That day in the interview.. - Hello. What is your name? - What? Rahul Mazumdar. I see. So you are the same one who was.. ..speaking in Bengali in group discussion. Yes, madam. So you remember? If you would not have helped me that day.. - It was only for that day. All the work in the office happens in English. So learn quickly. These are the project files. Go through them in details. Ask me if you have a problem. Why are you staring at them? - What? Hello. This is not a school where I have to spoon feed you.. ..to make you learn. Ask me if you get stuck somewhere. Now leave. Yes. Excuse me. Who will take your file? What is your problem, man? Where do they come from? This one will drive me mad. Why do you get scolded by Anuradha madam? I don't understand anything. And she isn't even teaching me properly. You are unlucky to have landed with her. She is the strictest trainer of this office. - What? You are stuck, boss. You are stuck. These are basic study material. Have a look at them. Study all night. Okay? Careful! There are five books. I will take them next week. - Yes. Keep them nicely. - Yes. Even if one book is ruined... Take an auto and go home. No car. Ramu. You can leave. The office car is just for me. Not for personal use. Okay? Hey, you can tell me and start. Hey madam. What? - Are you like this since childhood? Sullen faced. You can smile sometimes. What do you mean? - Nothing, nothing. Go, go. - You! What do you think of yourself? Yes? Listen, I am your senior. Talk politely with me. If you do it again, I will report.. - Lower your volume, madam. Lower your volume. This is not the office. Ladies hostel. Talk politely like a girl here. You are not my trainer here. And I am not your trainee. - You... Relax. Relax! You will feel unwell if you get upset. Smile at times. You will see that you will feel healthy. And you will look nice if you smile. Bye. Say bye to me sweetly. Stupid. Did she just see me or is it just my imagination? I don't know why but whenever she is around me.. ..my heart beats as fast as a train engine. Hey, she saw me. I won't understand all this ever. Tina. - Yes. Please see what happened. I guess this is a system error.. - I think so too. What is wrong? Oh no.. - Something is wrong. What happened? For God's sake, will somebody tell me what happened? He crashed the whole system, sir. What? Who are you? New trainee, sir. Who is your trainer? Fool, I am asking you a question. Who is your trainer? It is me, sir. - You? Then it is entirely your fault. How could you have the guts to allow.. ..a new trainee to work on such an important.. ..project without giving him proper training? Is this child's play? Can you do as you feel like? You stupid, careless woman! Go and sit at home if you don't wish to work. How will I deliver the project now? Will you go and give an answer to the client? Sir, she is not at fault. You fool! I don't want to talk to you at all. I am only going to talk to your trainer. This is absolutely her responsibility. What is the last date of delivery? Tomorrow, sir. Listen, if you can't complete the project by tomorrow.. ..and deliver it, you will be thrown out of this job. Understand? 'Listen, if you can't complete the project by tomorrow..' '..and deliver it, you will be thrown out of this job.' What happened? Why are you so restless? Have you lost your job? That is fine. I knew you wouldn't be able to keep the job. Go. Take rupees 100 from me from tomorrow.. ..and start buying application form. Keep quiet. Stop talking rubbish. The job isn't gone. It isn't gone? Then why are you worried? I see. Then I am sure someone has lost his or her job because of you. You cause trouble wherever you go. Excuse me. Excuse me. What is happening here? What is happening? Hey, what are you doing here? Listen, you are not supposed to be working here. Sir, the project is ready. Well done. Congratulations. Thank you, sir. - I am proud of you. Congratulations. - Thank you. Congratulations. Congratulations, ma'am. - Thank you. Congratulations. - Congratulations. - Congratulations. Congratulations ma'am. - Congratulations. Congratulations ma'am. - Congratulations. Congratulations ma'am. - Congratulations. Congratulations ma'am. - Congratulations. Thank you. Thank you. Rahul.

No, madam, what I wanted to say is that.. ..we don't come abroad all the time. And apart from that, we are done for the day. Can't all of us go for an outing? Come on. Where do you want to go? Bhowmick sir.. - Hey. - He was talking about a club. Club? Which club? No, I mean, they are young boys. They want to enjoy after work. You can go and rest. Why? Am I not young? Even I have worked all day like you. Even I want to enjoy. I will come with you. Too good. Such amazing dance. Disgusting. Madam. Don't call it disgusting. It will be a crime. How many are lucky enough to see a dance like this? Tell me. I beg of you, madam. Please let me watch it once. Please. Please. It is enough. You don't have to act anymore. Go and enjoy with them. No, no, I don't like all this. Really? May I know the reason? That is a long story. Forget it. What is the matter? Tell me. Actually when a boy really loves someone.. ..he doesn't like all this. He can only see his girlfriend in all the girls. Really? Can you see your girlfriend in them? Wow. I didn't know she dances so well. Hello. Enough. What are you having? Orange juice. I see. Place an order for me too. No, no, you.. - Hey. Same. Please. I am your senior. You answer me, fool. I am your senior. You answer me, fool. No, I mean, you are actually... What? Only this was left. Oh no. Hey madam. How many pegs have you had? I saw. You had the whole bottle in a jiffy. Rascal. I asked for an orange juice and the bartender.. ..mixed something else.

Will you lock the door and go off to sleep? I will run outside. - What? That will be a problem. She will run outside if I leave her here. You can sleep here. I am very sleepy. Good night. I will run outside... I will leave.. - I can't trust her. She can run away.. - I will run away. I will run outside... Good morning. - Morning. Coffee? You? In my room? In a towel? Night dress? Where did this night dress come from? Where are my clothes? Oh no! This is a huge problem. Oh my God. Listen, nothing that you are imagining has happened. Listen. Hey listen. Listen. Last night you got drunk and puked on my clothes. And you puked on yourself too. And I had to stay here to clean all that. So where did you get the guts to change my clothes? I didn't change your clothes. A female staff member of this hotel came and changed. And I was standing outside. Go and find out if you don't believe me. Then couldn't you go to your room? Did you have to stay in my room? Wow. Now you can say that. Last night, you forced me to stay here. I? Asked you? - Yes. Don't lie to me. I know how men are. Hey, madam, I don't know the men you are talking about. But I am an Indian boy by my heart. I know how to respect women. I wouldn't do anything in life to disrespect a woman. Trust me if you want to. You were lying there all night like a corpse while sleeping. And I was sitting here to watch you. That is the truth. That is it. Well done. - Well done. Well done. - Thank you. Really, Mr. Rahul, it was a nice presentation. Ma'am, your team is well prepared. Thank you. - Absolutely. We are very happy. And from our side, this is on. We can sit and finalize the details. Congratulations, Rahul. With Otto Technologies, our project has been finalized. And our trip is successful. And thanks. - That is my job. I mean, for whatever you did for me yesterday. I am really sorry for misunderstanding you. I don't know what I did out of intoxication. And I spoke rubbish because of my morning's tension. I am extremely sorry. Come on, please forgive me.

I want to say something to you. I can't understand how to tell you. Anuradha. I love you. I know I don't deserve to be in love with you. But I will take care of you. I will love you a lot. I want to marry you. I am getting married next month. Please don't joke. - I am not joking. Even the invitation cards are ready. In fact, I had thought of inviting you in some time. What are you saying? This is the first time.. ..when everything has been going fine in my life. And I can't even think of losing you in all this. No, no, you have to fall in love with me, Anuradha. Don't talk like a mad man. How much do you know me? The modern girl that you see is just for work. Because I love my job. But my family is completely different. They are very strict. My grandfather will kill me if he comes to know. Love? I can't love anyone. But why am I giving explanations to you? Please leave me alone. Anuradha. - Yes? I know that you love me. Your eyes say that. Why are you doing this? Rahul, leave my hand. - No. Rahul, leave my hand. Rahul, leave my hand. What, sir? How was your foreign tour? What happened? Won't you eat? No. - Why? I told you that I am not hungry. Switch off the light. So you should have told me earlier. I wouldn't have cooked. The food has been wasted. Here. Take the cost and leave. What happened? Hey, I am asking something. Why are you bothering me? Please let me live in peace. What happened to you? Why are you behaving madly? That is because I have gone mad. A girl has made your son mad and left. I love her a lot. This is the first time I have loved someone like this. I started working for her sake. I started weaving so many dreams. She broke your son's dreams and left. Her marriage has been fixed. So won't this make me sad? Should I dance out of happiness? You won't understand, father. Please leave. Leave, leave. But sir.. - I don't want any further explanation. You have to finish this work in two days. I want you to finish this job in next two days. Mind you. Anuradha. Greetings. I am Rahul's father. Tell me. - I wanted to talk to you about something personal. Hello, Rahul? - Yes? Why have you sent your father to office? Father? I haven't sent him. - He has come here. And he is talking to Anuradha. Look dear, I am not praising my son. Rahul may be naughty. But he has a nice heart. I have never seen him running after girls. This is the first time he has fallen in love. With you. He loves you a lot. I am a dry-natured man. How would I understand anything about love? But I have understood this much.. ..that Rahul won't be able to stay without you. This is the first time I have seen him crying for a girl. I have seen him so restless. My son is crying. Being his father, can I remain quiet? Tell me. I don't know what has happened between both of you. No. I can understand your state too. I am not asking you to fall in love with him right now. I am just saying that please think about it, dear. - Keep quiet. Don't you have brains? What are you saying? You are talking about all this with an unknown girl? Aren't you feeling ashamed? Your son has made a mistake. And you are defending him? Disgusting. You are so aged. Didn't you think even once before talking to me? You and your son. Please leave me alone. if you bother me again, I will file a complaint with police. Please leave me alone. Your son hugged me in front of everyone forcefully. Do you know the kind of rumors that have spread in the office? Both of you know that my marriage has been fixed. And you are doing all this despite knowing that? Aren't you human beings? Disgusting! Rahul got two marks less in interview. He got this job as I sympathized with him and have two marks. And today, both of you are giving this to me in return? What is all this? Yes? He was worried about me. That is why he has come to talk to you. He is an aged man. You could have been patient and explained it. What is the need to shout? - Hey. What nonsense! Both of you can talk nonsense and I will suffer it silently? This foolish man is saying.. - Hey! Don't say even one unkind word against him. Not even one. I have been listening to your rubbish since a long time now. Tell me the truth. Didn't you know that I love you? All I said was Anuradha all the time. Couldn't you see it? I used to roam around you all the time. Didn't you see that? Hey, girls can sense boys looking at them even from a distance. And I used to sit in the office and look at you all the time. Didn't you understand that? You knew everything and now you are acting smart now. Hey, if you didn't like me. ..you could have said that you want to marry an NRI. My status doesn't match yours. What is the point of acting so much in front of everyone? Yes? You want to get people's sympathy? Right? Anyway, there is no point in exaggerating the matter. The matter has happened between you and me. There is no need to get him into this. Come on, ask for forgiveness from him. Come on. I will call the security. Security. Security. - You can't do that. Ask for forgiveness. Dear. Hey, I will kill you.. - Hey, sir, come with us. Come with us. Come with.. - Hey, she has hit my father. Leave her, leave her, dear. - I hope you aren't hurt, father. No. I am fine. I am fine.. You hit my father. - Come with me. Come with me. - Rahul, don't do that. - I will kill you.. Rahul Listen. Calm down, dear. Let us go home. Let us go home. Come on. Anuradha. Anuradha, please don't cry. Don't cry. Have you started drinking everyday these days? No, I drink when I am upset. Don't make it a habit. It is not good for health. Father. Your cheeks seem swollen. Come on, we will go to a doctor. The girl is strong. Who asked you to go there? Tell me. I would have been okay in two days. Is she the only girl in the world? Forget all that. - What do you mean by that? She hit you and I will spare her? I wouldn't care even if I had to go to prison. I won't spare her. - Hey. Why are you talking rubbish? Did she hit me on purpose? It happened because of the confusion. Think about her side once. Once father. Once son. We were going on about love. Anyone can get angry about it. What is this? Why are you talking on her behalf? The reason is that she is a nice girl. Yes. One can guess by looking at her. What happened? Don't you want to have more? No. I had it after a long time. My head feels dizzy. I will go off to sleep. - What? Watch it, watch it. Father, father. Leave me. Leave me, leave me. Hey, leave me. I am fine. Do you think I have become old? DO you know, I get marriage proposals till date? I can see that. You have lost your mind at this age. Come on. Careful, careful. - Leave me. Careful. Now... Go off to sleep. Are you still upset? You had to face a lot of insult because of me. Forget it. Don't think about all that. Son. Yes, father. - Did you become so angry because the girl slapped me? So do you love me a lot? Why are you asking all of a sudden? Let it be. Forget it. I just asked. No, I mean, father, you are asking all of a sudden. Leave it. Go, eat and go off to sleep. - Father. Let it be. Go. What is it? What happened? Why did you call us so early in the morning? Father is dead. - What? - What? I don't know what to do. You... All of a sudden? What happened? Last night... I don't know what happened. Last night he asked me if I loved him. I couldn't let him know. Father, I love you a lot. Father, I love you a lot. Father, I love you a lot. I love you a lot. Father, I love you a lot. I love you a lot. How did this happen.. - He was such a nice man. Take this. - What is this for? This is for the expenses of the rites. You keep it. The money that I have with me will be enough. No. When father was alive, I couldn't do anything for him. At least... Hail Lord. - Hail the Lord. Hail Lord. - Hail the Lord. Hail Lord. - Hail the Lord. Hail Lord. - Hail the Lord. Hail Lord. - Hail the Lord. Hail Lord. - Hail the Lord. Hail Lord. Father. What have you cooked, father? Father... Rahul. We have come from LIC office. Your father had made a policy of ten lakhs. We have come with those documents. You have to sign them. Your mother's jewelry is in the state bank locker. Please collect those. Your father had five lakhs in his PF. Please collect it. 'Hey, school master. What have you done in life?' 'You have just taught students since the last thirty years.' 'You can't give me rupees 100.' 'And you are advising me.' I killed you, father. I killed you. You would have been alive.. ..if I wouldn't have loved that girl. You would have been alive.. Father. Rahul. - Rahul. Rahul. - Rahul. - Rahul. Hey Rahul. - Yes? Rahul, what happened to you? Throw it. Yes. Rahul. - Rahul. - Rahul. - Rahul. Hey Rahul, what happened to you? What is it? - Why you lying here like this? I killed my father. I am responsible. - Hey, why would you be responsible? Can anyone control destiny? Look, whatever had to happen has happened. But you have to remain alive. - Yes? I don't have any right to be alive. I killed my father. Why are you saying all this, Rahul? Yes? Have you eaten anything? Yes? Hey, go. Go and get food. - Yes. Come. Take this. Have something. Or you will become unwell. Eat. Eat. Here, have this. Eat. - Eat. Eat. - Have food. Please have something. - Please have something. Eat. Eat. - Eat. Have food. Hey! Have you gone mad? Want to die of starvation? What do you think?

I have some land work. Then you know that my wedding is lined up. But I can't leave him here like this. What I want to say is that can we take him to our flat? Hey. Our flat is small. It will be a problem. Rahul. Will you go to the village house with me? Hey, come out of the house once. You will feel light when you come into a new environment. And I have a joint family. There are a lot of people in the house with my uncles and all. You will feel nice when you stay with everyone. What do you think? That is right. Go, Rahul. - Yes. Go and stay out for sometime. You will feel nice. Go. Keep a watch on him. - Yes, yes. Rahul. Take care of yourself. And I will take an off and come as soon as possible. Okay? - Okay, fine. What happened? Why are you getting restless? Hey, I can't see her. Has she taken another bogie? Hey, hey, come on, come on. Get up, get up, get up. Okay, okay.. - Yes, yes. - Get up, get up. My phone. - Rahul, stay carefully. Stay well. I will come. As soon as possible. Don't be sad. We will meet. Rahul. In some time, you would have missed it. You are very late... Come on. Give me the bag. What happened? Come on. Oh no. Let me introduce you. She is Anu. My would-be wife. And this is Rahul. My best friend. What is it? You had made my life hell till now. Make me meet her and talk to her. Why are you staring at her now? Come on, come on, come on. We will sit and talk. Come on, come on. Rahul. Rahul. Hey, what happened? I won't go. I am getting down. What do you mean? Will you jump off a running train? Have you gone mad? Hey, tell me, what happened? Look, you are getting married. What should I do? Meaning? You won't come for my wedding? You don't understand. If I go, there will be a problem. Hey, what problem? I want you to go out so that you feel better. Look, you are stretching this too far. Come with me quietly. Or else, I won't get married. Abhi. Come here once. Tell me. Why is he coming with us? Do you know him? No. But you know grandfather. In any case, he is angry with us. There will be a bigger problem if he comes with us. You don't know. He is not in a good state of mind. His father died all of a sudden. He doesn't have anyone except his father. And in this state, if I leave him and go.. ..I think he will go mad. Hey, Anu. What happened to you? His father... When did he die? It has been four days. In his sleep. Heart attack. Where is the village, Abhi? It is here. We have to cross the village and go. Hey Abhi. You have come after such a long time. Give, give, give. Give me your bag. Daughter-in-law. Are you fine? Give. Give me your bag. Come on. People respect you a lot in this village. It is not me. It is my grandfather. He rules this village. Understand? Villagers think of him as God. Your fiancée stays in your village? Yes. Hey, Anu's house is just next to mine. In fact, her grandfather is a very good friend of mine. They had decided on our alliance ever since we were kids. After an accident, her whole family passed away. My grandfather took her responsibility. Since then, she is a part of our family. After passing engineering, grandfather wanted us to get married. But both of us wanted to have our careers first. Establish ourselves. Everyone in the house understood us. They were in our favor. But grandfather is still angry with us. We didn't listen to him. He is an egoistic man. He has strict principles. Now there is just one faith. He loves Anu much more than me. Why didn't you introduce us to her all this while? Hey, she never used to meet me. How could I introduce her to you? Come on. Come on, come on. Come. Hey, not here, that side. - Yes. Hey, the chili is nice, right sister? - Yes. Oh God. Look who is here? Abhi! Anu! - Come here. Sister. Then you prepare all the papers and meet me tomorrow. I will send him the notice in any way I can. Take his blessings. - Let it be. Daughter-in-law. Tell them that their grandfather is dead. What? - Don't do that, elder sir. They are kids. They have such big jobs in the city. Could they do anything by staying here? Why have you come to talk? Did I ask you to interfere? Kids! - Grandfather. Who is this? He is my friend. - What? My friend. He will.. - What will he do here? He will stay here with me for some time. - Stay here? Monkey. As if one monkey wasn't enough that you had to get another. Look at his face. Fool. Daughter-in-law. - Father. Tell him not to come in front of me ever. Rahul. Don't go. He is speaking rubbish. Please don't mind. Anu has become so pretty. Right. - Absolutely right. Move, move, move, move.. - Hey, hey, hey. Move. - Hey. Sister, here. Have a cold drink. You have traveled in the harsh Sun. Have it. - Yes. Yes. - Have it. Hey, let me see, let me see, let me see. What happened to you? - Move. Move. Hey, I can't talk to my would-be daughter-in-law. Father, how are you? - Hey, keep quiet. Who wants to talk to you? I want to talk to my daughter-in-law first. I have seen you after so long. You are right, brother. You are right. After a year, your mother-in-law should be able to see a grandchild. Come on.. Come on.. - Come inside. Come on. - Come on. - Your family is strange. Come on. - You aren't even married. And they are thinking about kids? Hey, all this happens in a village. Come on. Come inside. Who is she? Strange family! Hey, hey, hey, hey. - Hey. Get up. - Hey. - Get up. What happened? - Who are you? Why are you hitting me? - Who are you, boy? Fool! - Hey. - Fool. Hey, it is hurting me. Hey, why are you hitting me? Hey, why are you hitting me? Hey, hey, hey.. - Hey, what have I done? What is it? Hey, leave. Leave, I am telling you. - Why are you hitting me? - Oh no. This is a misfortune. Maybe he is of a low caste or something. No one knows. He made this seat dirty. Fool! Hey Ramu. Ramu. Where did he go? Ramu. Get Ganges water. - Coming, coming. I have to sprinkle Ganges water on my seat. Grandmother. Here. Take this. This is misfortune. Misfortune. Hey, what are you doing here? Come on, come on. - Leave me. Why did you call me here? - Hey, what happened? Everyone is speaking rubbish. You stay with your family. So.. - I am leaving. Hey, tell me, what happened? Hey, I was just sitting on this chair. She is abusing my caste for that and hitting me with a stick. Look Rahul. She is my grandmother. And that chair is her husband's. Since the time he has passed away.. ..she gets angry even if someone touches it. Forget about sitting on it. Actually she is aged. She has lost her mind. She has lost her mind. But she hasn't lost her strength. Oh no. She hit me hard enough to break my bones. Okay. Come on, come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on. That is it. I won't need it, Swarna Kamal. Brother. Not Swarna Kamal. Soniya. I mean, the matter is.. - Got it. Got it. You don't have to say anything else. Oh no. I think the whole house is mad. Hey. What is this? What happened? Hey, in which avatar are you standing? Hey, won't I bathe? - Like this? You have to bathe like this here. No bathroom. Change your clothes and wear this. This one? - Yes. Whose size is this? Hey, this is even smaller than a kerchief. Leave it. I will bathe in the morning. Hey Rahul. Sir. You can't go inside without taking a bath. Grandmother's orders. Hey, grandmother's henchman. I will give you one slap. - What? I can't take a bath in that small towel. Okay. So bathe without one. Hey, get lost. Hey, why did you hit me? Do you know who I am in this family? Hey. I will strangle you with this towel and kill you. You will forget being a henchman. Rahul. I need to talk to you. Sir, it is me. Ramu. Please don't hit me. What happened? So late at night? It is not night anymore. Get up. It is a rule not to stay in bed after dawn. Hey, will you go away? Please come, sir. If grandfather comes to know, he will not let me remain alive. Okay, I am coming. Go. Hey, what is happening here? Hail. Hail. - Hail. Hail Lord. Hail Lord. - Hail Lord. God is great. God is great. - God is great. Please keep us from sin. - Hey, what are you doing? Please keep us from sin. - Please keep us from sin. Thank God. At least I got tea in the morning. What is this? Neem juice. - What? It is a medicine. If you have it in the morning on an empty stomach.. ..you will be healthy. Have it, have it. Start it. What is this? Why are they pushing? What is this? Walk for ten minutes. You will have a clean stomach. Grandfather's rule. Come on. Hey, it will be done if we sit. Come on. Hey, walking like this here... What a strange family! Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. It is okay. - Sorry. Hey, where are we going now? To the field. - Field. Why? To clean the stomach. Grandfather's rule. Isn't there a bathroom here? Hey, get lost. Hey, this is a village. Everyone completes ablutions on the field. Come on, let us go and complete the work. Come on. Hey, where have I come? These are mad rules. How can anything come out in this cold? It is so dark everywhere. God knows if there are snakes around. Abhi. Abhi. Hey, what are you doing? Sorry, sorry. Abhi. Abhi. Abhi. Abhi. - What happened? I am done. What should I do? Get up. What? Like this? Oh no. Hey, quiet mister. Shouldn't I clear a doubt if I have one? How would I know if I don't ask? Too much. Abhi. Wash yourself when you go to the pond to take a bath. Clean with a leaf at the moment. With a leaf? Now where should I get a leaf in this dark? Forget it. I will wash in the pond. Let me sleep now. Hey, look at him. Shameless. He is sitting naked in the daytime. He is shameless. - Yes. He is shameless. - Yes. Oh no. Where have all the shameless people gone? Oh no. God, this is so cold. Hey Abhi, will you kill me? Hey, how are you doing this? Hey, why are you getting scared? Just hold your breath and go down. You won't feel cold anymore. Yes, yes. No, no, no, no. - I won't be able to have anymore. Have it. - Have it. No, I can't. - You can. Have it. - Have it. Have you seen what have you done to yourself without eating? Eat. - I am full. Trust me. Have it. - Aunt. Do you want to say something? Abhi.. - Abhi has gone to the field with everyone. Didn't you go? No. Actually I came back after bathing and went off to sleep. I see. Tell Ramu. He will take you. Okay. Now open your mouth. Have it. No. - Again the same thing? I can't. - You have to. Have it. Have it. I am telling you. Aunt. - Yes? I am feeling very ashamed to say something. I am very hungry. Can you give me some food? Oh no. What is this? Why are you ashamed? This is your house. - Yes. Hey Deepa. - Yes? Why are you staring? Go and give him fried snacks. Go. - Yes. Hey, the poor one is hungry. Go and serve him food. Go, go, go. I am going. - Come, dear. Come inside. What is it? - Yes? Why are you sitting quietly? Have you forgotten to take care of guests? Go. Hey, not so much. - Give. Give him more. - No, you have to eat. He is hungry. - But I can't have so much.

Eat. - Eat. Rahul. Rahul please. I know you don't want to talk to me. Please don't look at me like that. I know I have caused a huge loss to you. And for that, I can't ever forgive myself. I understand your pain. You are in this state because of me. For me, your father... I have killed a good man. I can't even ask for forgiveness from you. No. Please don't cry. The house is full of people. What will they think if they see you? Please. Apart from that, why are you asking for forgiveness? It is my mistake. Without knowing anything about you... I came to this house and understood. The whole family loves you. It is not possible for you to love me by ignoring them. Don't hold yourself responsible for my father's death. He got a massive heart attack. He went away in his sleep. How many people can go away in such a lot of peace? If you have a problem with me staying here, I will go away. No, no, I don't have a problem. What is it? Hey. What happened? She... It is nothing, aunt. She wanted to know something about Abhi. I see. - About whatever he does and everything. As if you have seen Abhi for the first time. Foolish girl. Hey, listen, it is Annapurna veneration tomorrow. Keep all the things ready. We have to go to the temple early in the morning. Remember it. Give me food. - Hey, here it is. May you become a queen, dear! Hey, why are you standing here? Work quickly. People have sat down to eat. Let it not be too hot, okay? So elder sir. Are you fine? I just broke your lawyer's hands and came to you. How dare you send a notice to me? Your family.. - Listen to me. That land of Sodhpur is my ancestral property. I had given it to you for farming. Now you want to take it away? Get out of here. Or else, I will inform the police. Police? They will nab me? You made me laugh. Hey, sister-in-law. - What? - Are you fine? Hey Bolti. Greetings. You are here? Good, good, good, I can see that all the women of your house are here. Why are you compelling me to get dirty, elder sir? Just sign this paper. I will go. Or else.. - Or else? What will you do? I will touch. Not you. The women. In front of everyone. And I am sure you understand the places I am talking about. Hey fool. - Hey Abhi. I will cut your tongue off. - Abhi. Leave him. - I will kill you. Abhi. Hey, Abhi. - Hey, hey. Leave me. - Hey, what is this? What is all this? - Hey, leave me. Leave me. You didn't listen to me when I said nicely. Now wait and watch what happens. Hey. Grandfather. Come on. - Come on. Come on. - Get away from here. Hey, who are you? Fighting on their family's behalf? Hey old man. Are women of your family getting men with them? Hey. - Hey. Come on. Sorry, grandfather. I was compelled to fight. Actually I couldn't take the way this fool insulted you. That is why I thought this is the right way to teach him a lesson. Don't you know how to talk to an old man? Come on, ask for forgiveness. Come on, ask for forgiveness. Say. Elder sir, forgive me. Say it. Elder sir, forgive me. Say it. It seems he hasn't forgotten you yet. Say it properly. Beg for it. Come on, come on. Elder sir, Elder sir, Elder sir. I beg of you. Forgive me or he will kill me. I beg of you. Elder sir. Forgive me. I beg. Yes. - Get lost. Uncle. That was great. - You fought very well. Uncle. That was great. - You fought very well. Really. What you have done for us.. - Move, move. I can't even thank you.. - Let me see. His hand is cut. We have to apply medicine. - Oh God. Really. - He got a cut. It is a deep wound. I didn't notice. Give it. Give me the medicine. I will apply it. You can't. Give it. Anu. Hold his hand, dear. Hey, there is something here. - I will take care of it at home. Let me see. - Let us see. Show it, show it. - See. See. See. He fought so well. - Yes, he did. Yes, yes. Sir. How can I have such a nice body? You can have it if you stop being grandmother's henchman. Hey fool. Doesn't it hurt? Hey, what are you doing here? What are you doing here? Don't ask me so many questions. Go. Aunt is calling you. All this is not good. Tell me, Swarna Kamal. - Soniya. Oh yes, Soniya. What do you want to say? Look, I am a straight forward girl. I am very modern. - Good. I can't keep secrets in my heart. - Very good. I have liked you since the first time I saw you. And when I heard you have no one.. ..your loneliness touched my heart. And today? When you fought for my family today.. ..I started liking you on seeing your courage. So? So? I think. - You think? I think I love you. - What? Oh God, what happened to me? I feel mad when I see him. What happened? What happened? Tell me. Sister. Sister, will you help me? Please. Whom do I have apart from you? Tell me. You are my only hope and faith. - Right? Okay. But what is the matter? Oh no. Tell me, what happened? Sister. I think.. - You think? I am in love with Rahul. What? - Yes, sister. What are you saying? Sister, please manage grandfather so that he lets us get married. Marriage? No. I mean, not right now. Let your marriage happen first. It is okay if it happens after two or three months. What rubbish? Oh God. No, no, this isn't right. It can't happen. - Why? Why can't it happen? I don't know all that. But you can't love him. That is it. - Why? Reason? Reason is that I don't like him at all. Why will you like him? I like him a lot. That is it. Hey. God. Please, please sister. You love me, right?

I don't know why. What brought me here? These people mean everything to me. I have been brought up by then, since childhood. I have got love. They have a right on me. But I forgot everything and came running to you. I don't know why. I just felt that I won't remain alive of I don't see you. Is this love? Then why didn't it happen to me then? When you spoke about love to me. I can't understand anything, Rahul. It is my wedding tomorrow. And I am here so late night. Please say something to me. Don't remain quiet, Rahul. Please say something. What is my mistake? You are not wrong. It is my mistake. I came to your life at a wrong time. But what should I do now? Can't you? Can't you hold my hand, go and tell grandfather? That you love me and want to marry me. You are someone's fiancée. You are getting married tomorrow. If someone spots you here with me.. ..they will misunderstand. Come on, I will drop you home. Do you still hold me responsible for your father's death? No, no. - It is not that. Then, tell me, what do I need to do? Should I beg of you for love? - Hey.. .. you know that I used to run to you everyday.. ..with just one hope. Just for one look from you. Then why are you making me return today? Can't you speak to grandfather? - What should I say? What should I say? You want me to finish a whole family. The moment when grandfather accepted.. ..me as a member of this family.. ..was when I decided that this family is mine too. I was without a family and I got everyone here. Grandfather, grandmother, aunt, uncle. A whole family. When the kids throng around me calling me uncle.. ..I feel I have got everything. And should I go and tell those.. ..people that I love you and want to marry you? Will they be able to take this pain? They will hate me. They will hate me. Their happy family will be broken into pieces. And I will be the only one responsible for this. And my friend, Abhi, who is dearer to me than life. He got me here so that I could be happy. Should I ruin the happiness of his life? No, Anuradha. I can bear the pain of losing you. But I can't lose my family and friend. Is this your last decision? - Yes. Then I have to say nothing. It is my misfortune. I lost a person like you. When will you get married? I won't. As I won't be able to love anyone as I have loved you. Tomorrow will start a new life for you. And that day will clear your heart of our relationship. Abhi is a very nice boy. He will keep you very happy. Don't drink too much. Can you please listen to me once? Please smile. You look very nice when you smile. Grandfather. Actually.. - Let it be. You don't have to explain anything. I can see that I gave food to a snake. You came to this house as a guest. And I made you a family member. And taking that as an advantage.. - No, no, grandfather. Keep quiet. You don't have to act. In tomorrow's pious ritual of our family.. ..I don't want you to be there. Leave the village right now. Grandfather. - Don't even dare. Don't take my name from that mouth. I hate to be close to you. I just want to know. Is only your heart ruined? Or else... Disgusting. Didn't you feel ashamed? Didn't you feel ashamed.. ..to ruin the respect and name.. ..of the family that has brought up with love and care? No, grandfather. You are misunderstanding. Keep quiet. What is the point in understanding.. ..a girl who crosses the threshold of.. ..the house and goes to meet another man at midnight? You know, what is the respect that villagers have for.. ..women of this house? That of a Goddess. Forget about touching them. They can't look into their eyes while talking. And being a woman of this house.. ..you went and hugged another man at midnight? Aren't you ashamed that one who is getting married.. ..tomorrow is.. - Father. Abhi.

Yes, keep it here. Hey brother. Brother, don't open this. This wedding will happen, Brother, please. Hey sister. Please don't take this. Hey brother. Brother, don't open it. Put it up. Hey, what are you doing? Keep it. Keep it. Hey brother. I am asking you. Don't open it. I am asking you. Don't open it. Abhi. - How dare you come into this house? Get out of here. Cheat. You can call me anything that you want. But please don't say no to this wedding. Please. You are making a mistake, Abhi. - Yes, I made a mistake. By thinking of you as a friend and trusting you.. ..I have made the biggest mistake. No, Abhi, listen. Stop. I brought you to our house.. ..so that you can forget your pain. And you ruined all my happiness. By acting that you are in love with her.. ..you want to take Anu away from me. Thankless cheat. Before I do something, leave. Go. I will go. I will go. I am just requesting you before I leave. Please don't misunderstand Anuradha. Anuradha is as clean as you consider your mother. She is just as innocent. If loving someone is a crime.. ..then all the girls in the world are wrong. Your family has brought her up. Your values, culture and respect. Her duty towards this family. She hasn't forgotten that even for a moment. Even if I would have forced her.. ..to run away with me, she wouldn't have. She loves you very much. And think of my luck. After losing my parents, I had just got a family. Grandfather. Grandmother. Aunt. Uncle. Kids. With their love, I had forgotten for a moment that I am an orphan. I lost everyone. Grandfather. Please forgive me if I have made a mistake. But please don't punish Anuradha because of me. Grandmother. Take care of yourself. "Love is white and love is black." "That is why love is so painful."

Give me your hand. Hey, we will take him to the hospital. Okay? - Yes, yes, yes. The guest that you had. Shankar stabbed him and threw him on the field. He is soaked in blood. I don't think the boy will remain alive. We have to take him to the city hospital. If someone could come with us.. - Rahul. Elder sir. - The fool doesn't have sense. Don't you know what is to be said at what time? You can see that a wedding is going on. And amidst that... Someone will go when the wedding gets over. Priest. - Yes. There is no time. At least give us your car. Ramu. - Yes. Go and tell the driver. - Yes, yes, okay. Abhi. The time for the wedding is going away. You do your work. Sister. I told you to go when the wedding is over. Sit here. Abhi, Abhi, Abhi. I need some money. Please come with some money. I will pack his clothes, okay? Come... What is this? You are still sitting here? I see. Rahul is your enemy now. And why would you bother if the enemy is alive or dead? I was wrong in saying that. Sorry. - Come on, I will go with you. For him, the wedding in important. Not Rahul's life or death. Hey, come on, come on. Kartik. Wait. Even I am coming. - What? No son. - Don't go. Forgive me, father. I have never been disobedient. But I will be so today. Rahul doesn't have anyone. If a son makes a mistake, can a mother keep him away? Don't be angry, father. - Hey. You are still sitting here? He is the closest to you. Even you can go if you feel like. I would have gone a long time back if I had to go. But you haven't taught me that. Do you think I am getting married out of compulsion? No, grandfather. I did love Rahul for sure. I asked him to speak to you too. And the moment you disregarded him.. ..I forgot him too. Yes, I will sit here till they come back. I won't get up from here till the time Abhi comes and marries me. You can go if you want. But please ask someone to give me water, grandfather. My throat is dry. "I was thinking when I will get to see you." "My life was useless till date. Life was zero percent."
