♪ Hey, look, you guys. It'’s the Silvis School Queen Contest. When it is? Oh, my God, it'’s October 25th, I am so excited! My mom'’s been buying me clothes for this since last Thanksgiving. I have got to get a manicure. That'’s only six weeks away! This should be a breeze. Oh, God, Muff. You'’re going to enter? We don'’t even have a chance now. You know you'’re gonna win. The worst part is is that one of us will have to lose. Not necessarily. I'’m sure I can arrange it so that none of you have to be last. I just got a great idea. Ta-ta, girls. ♪ Smooth move, fatty. ♪ How'’s my little... Eartha? Oh, I love you. You'’re all that I have left since mom and dad died. At least you never make fun of me. "Dear Ms. Loden, congratulations. You have been accepted as a contestant in the Silvis Slough Queen Pageant. There will be an organizational meeting to introduce all... contest of talent, beauty, style, and patriotism. Once again, thank you for submitting your application, and congratulations on being chosen for this contest. Remember, it'’s not whether you win or lose but who has the best all around package. Sincerely, Betty T. Prunish, chairwoman." ♪ [locker opening] Hi, Cameron. Huh, oh, hi. Cameron, I'’ve been dying to talk to you. I got this letter in the mail yesterday from the Silvis Slough Queen Pageant. I can'’t believe it. Well, what'’s it say? It'’s says that I'’ve been accepted as a contestant. Phyllis, that'’s great. You know, my great-grandmother was one of the first queens of the Silvis Slough. And then my Aunt Edith, she was the Pork Queen of '’59. And then, of course, there was my cousin Eunice who was voted Ms. Congeniality in the Ms. Woodchuck Contest. You know, there is a lot of royalty in my family. I just never pictured myself in a queen contest. You know something, Phyllis? I had a dream about you last night. I dreamt that you were in the Queen Contest with my great-grandmother. Well, what happened? I don'’t know, my mom woke me up. She had to vacuum up some rug cleaner. My dog, Beady, peed on the shag carpet. Well, it'’s kinda weird that you had a dream about a queen contest with me in it. Phyllis, I think it was a premonition. I think you are supposed to be in that contest! Do you really think so? Yeah, Phyllis, I know so! It'’s in the stars. But, Cameron... I'’m not skinny and beautiful like those other girls. Look, just because Danny Gerig played a practical joke and showed that movie on your butt, now, that doesn'’t mean you don'’t have a beautiful soul. Do you really think so? Oh, that is the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me. Phyllis, this is your big chance to show the world that you'’re not just a fat slob, you'’re also a human being with feelings. [bell ringing] Oh, there'’s the bell. I gotta go, Phyllis. Yeah, me too. I gotta go to my cafeteria job. Cameron, thanks for talkin'’ to me about the pageant. I think I'’ll do it. Great. I'’ll see ya at lunch. Yeah, we'’re having chipped beef on toast, and I am making lemon Jell-O with carrots. I can'’t wait. So, anyway, I got this letter from the pageant. And I think I'’m gonna do it, Alma. That is great, Phyllis. You are such a good person. You work so hard here in the kitchen. Shoot, if they judge ya on, oh, efficiency and cookin'’ talent, you'’ll win hands down. Thank you, Alma. Why, girl, what ever is the matter with you? Oh. I don'’t know. I guess I just wish my parents could be here to see me enter this. They'’d be so proud. Phyllis, I bet your mama and daddy are looking down on you right now, and they'’re proud as punch. You really think so? Yes, I do. Now, look here, girl, you take this here leftover Jell-O, and you scoot on outta here. You gotta make that meetin'’ tonight. Thank you, Alma. You'’re so good to me. It t'’weren'’t nothin'’. Now, skedaddle. Thanks, Alma. I'’ll let you know how it goes. All right. ♪ Hey, Muffy, are you sure Phyllis is comin'’? I left a trail of M&M'’s. Don'’t worry, she'’ll be here. [laughing] ♪ Is this the contestant'’s meeting? Can I help you with something, my dear? I'’m here for the Ms. Slough Queen Contestant'’s meeting. Surely, there'’s been some mistake. Are you sure you don'’t want the cooking class? It'’s down the hall, in room 201. No, I'’m here for the Ms. Slough Queen Contest. Well, let me check. Your name, my dear? Phyllis Loden. Phyllis. Phyll-- Phy-- Oh, here it is. Phyllis Loden. May I just take a peek at your letter? Sure. Thank you. Well, since we'’re all present and accounted for, I suppose we have to call this meeting to order. Ms. Loden, why don'’t you have a seat with the other contestants. Have a seat, Phyllis. [laughing] That'’s good. Now, girls, for those of you who may not know me, I am Betty Prunish, executive chairwoman of the Slough Queen Pageant. [clapping] [laughing] There, there. Now, thank you very much. Now, girls, I would like to explain a few things about this contest. First point of order, of course, is the judging system. And now, then, girls, all girls will be judged in three categories. One, talent, two, swimsuit/evening gown and three, scholastic achievement/question and answer. Excuse me, Mrs. Prunish, I hate to interrupt, but, how many points are based on scholastic achievement? Well, the point breakdown is as follows, for talent, 25 percent, for swimsuit/evening gowns, 70 percent, and for scholastic achievements/question and answer five percent. [laughing] Thank God. [crunching] And, girls, let me remind you, let'’s try to watch our calorie intake over the next few weeks before the pageant. Let this be your personal creed. "Eat smart, think thin, and win!" Excuse me, I'’m very sorry. Phyllis, Phyllis, thank God I found you. [exhaling] I--I was cat sitting Eartha, like you told me to, and she got out of the house, and she ran up a tree. The fire department is there. She won'’t come down. Eartha was hissing and everything. One guy got clawed. They'’re gonna chop down the tree! You gotta come home right away! They'’re pissed. Oh, my God. Eartha, my kitty. Ms. Prunish, I gotta go. My kitty Eartha'’s in trouble. Who was that... boy? That was Cameron Owens, all time major geek of the universe. He actually hangs out with that thing, Phyllis Loden. I see. Girls, let me end with a few final thoughts, first, I want you all to concentrate on this pageant. Second, I want none of you to display yourselves in the fashion that I saw displayed before me in this room tonight. And third, I want that Larder girl out of my pageant! Since it is impossible to do anything about that now, you are each personally charged with a mission. Make this pageant a living hell for her. Do we understand each other, girls? Good. Thank you all for coming this evening. May the best girl win. And we all know who won'’t. Next time, we are not coming out. Oh, I'’m sorry. I'’m so sorry! My poor baby. She thinks I'’m going after that damn cat again, she can just forget it. Geeze, the way she looks, it'’s a wonder she hadn'’t eaten that cat. I'’d run up a tree, too, if I saw her comin'’ at me. [engine starting] Poor baby. My poor baby. Cameron, how did this happen? Well, I was watching Jeopardy, and I was winning, as usual, and I spilled some milk down the front of my pants and then when I went to go get a towel to clean it up, I saw the paper boy ride by, so, I figured I'’d go out and get the paper. And when I opened the screen door, Eartha got out, and then Mr. Coldwell'’s dog was sitting there, and he took off after her. And Eartha went tearing up that tree. I didn'’t even get a chance to see the bonus round. That'’s what happened. Oh, well, I'’m just glad she'’s okay. She'’s all I have, you know. Cameron, you were so smart to call the fire department. I don'’t know what I'’d do without you. Well, it--it wasn'’t that hard, except that when I hit the auto dial emergency number on the phone, it was Rapid Ready Pizza. Did you know that it was wrong? Oh, wow. That'’s kinda weird. I wonder how that happened? Oh, well. Thanks anyway. Hey, sure, no problem. Oh, so how'’d the meeting go? Great. Oh, that Mrs. Prunish is so nice. She gave us tips on how to win and everything! I actually think I may have a chance. Now, all I have to do is come up with a talent and get a swimsuit and an evening gown. Well, that shouldn'’t be that hard. Hey, you took tap for that--at that Ms. Levon School of Dance, what, two years back in grade school, right? ♪ And ya have a swimsuit, you know, the one with the little ruffle in the back? ♪ And an evening gown shouldn'’t be that hard. ♪ You can make it or something.

The tap shoes? Yeah. Tape? Oh my gosh, no. Well, don'’t worry, I'’ll run back and get it. You'’ve still got about 20 minutes before they announce you guys. Thank you, Cameron. Say, while you'’re out, could you pick me up a box of Twinkies? I only have one left. Yeah, sure, all right, okay, I'’ll be back in a few minutes. Hurry. Hello. Well, well, looks like we'’re all here. Yeah, and some of us are more here than others. [cackling] So, tell me, Phyllis, what are you going to do for your talent? Eat? [cackling] I'’m doin'’ a tap dance. Oh, God! I'’m doing a dance! Like you'’re actually worried? What song are you dancing to, "The Baby Elephant Walk?" [cackling] [distant chattering] Well, girls, I hope you'’re all ready. My, what an exciting day this is for all of us. Listen, the auditorium is almost full, and people are coming in fast and furious. I think we'’re gonna have a sell out. Girls, I'’d like to take this opportunity to tell you how much I'’ve enjoyed working on this contest. It has been my personal delight and privilege to get to know each and every one-- What the? Psst, hey, Phyllis, psst. Hey, ya in there? Oh, excuse me, Mrs. Prunish. I forgot my tape, and my friend went to get it for me. I'’ll be right back. Well! That reminds me. I hope all of you girls recall our earlier conversation regarding that woman. I will be checking to make sure that progress has been made. And I would hate to see any of you lose points for not cooperating. Not to worry, Mrs. P. I'’ve got it all under control. That'’s my girl, Muffy. Let'’s hope that the rest of you girls are working on this little project of ours. I want this to be the most humiliating experience of her life. Don'’t let me down. I think we'’ve each got a little scheme cooked up for our fine, fatty friend. ♪ Here, I brought Eartha. She kept trying to get out. Oh, great! Oh, here, I also brought your tape and your Twinkies, and I brought the rest of that sandwich you left sittin'’ on the counter last night. Eartha'’ll bring me luck. Thank you so much. Well, I better get back to the meeting. Wish me luck! Oh, hey, Phyllis, here, good luck. Well, girls-- Thanks again, Cameron, I really appreciate it! Oh, I'’m sorry. What were you saying? Oh my stars. I don'’t believe this. Well, dear, you didn'’t miss that much. I was simply wishing everyone the best. [sneezing] Bless you, dear. [sneezing] Goodness, dear, are you all right? It'’s my aller-- [sneezing] my allergies. She'’s allergic to cats. [sneezing] Cats? Well, why in the world would she start that now? That'’s why! [sneezing] Loden brought her cat in here! Oh my God. Ms. Larder, you will have to remove that cat at once! I can'’t. She keeps running away, and there'’s no one to take care of her. I don'’t know what to do. She'’s all the family that I have. Get it out. Get it out! Oh my God, I'’m starting to puff up! Get that thing outta here! Ms. Larder, I don'’t care what you do with it, just get it out of here! Yes, ma'’am. Yes, ma'’am. What a mess. Five minutes until the pageant starts, and now this happens. Girls, hop to. The show must go on. Shelley, you'’ll be on first in the talent competition. Elizabeth, dry your eyes, you'’ll be fine. It'’s all that Larder girl'’s fault. Just once before I die, I'’d like to have a pageant start on time. [stomping] Look at me, I'’m a mess. And I go on in five minutes. Alison, get her bag. Her medicine'’s in there. Shelley, get a cold towel for her face. She'’ll be fine in five minutes. Oh no! I'’m starting to get puffy. Look at me, I'’m all blotchy! I can barely breathe. Elizabeth, get a grip. You'’ll be fine. You always are. Don'’t worry. We'’ll get that sow. I guarantee it.

No. No, you'’re not, Phyllis. That'’s exactly what they want ya to do. Why else would they pull such a cheap and childish prank? Hey, you know what I think, I think they'’re actually afraid you'’re gonna win this contest. So, you know what you'’re gonna do, Phyllis? You are gonna suck it in. You'’re gonna wipe away those tears. You'’re gonna put on those tap shoes, square off your shoulders, and face those people like a man, huh? And don'’t let '’em get ya down. Remember, when the going gets tough, the tough get going. And nothing ventured, nothing gained. You have nothing to fear but fear itself. A fool and his money are soon parted.

Serves her right, the old hog. Well, at least we didn'’t have to watch her try and dance. Well, girls, it looks like we'’re going on to the swimsuit portion. Our little friend is just fine. She'’s just roughed up a little bit and she'’s insisting that she'’s well enough to go on with the contest. Pity, she should'’ve gotten out when she had the chance to get out gracefully. Well, it looks like we'’ll be starting shortly, so I'’d advise that you hurry and to get ready. Now, to save time, we'’re just gonna send you out all at once so the judges can evaluate you. Carry on!

If you were chosen as Miss Slough Queen, what will you do with the prize money? Well, I would use the money to help starving children in Africa. Oh God, I don'’t know. If I won, I'’d use the prize money to become a famous dancer and do U.S.O. world tours and stuff. I plan on using my title to help retarded and/or senior citizens throughout the world. I feel my talents are best used by sharing them. It'’s so important to make people happy and if baton twirling makes them happy, then I'’m happy and well, everyone'’s happy and we wouldn'’t have all these wars and stuff. I would probably be an instrumental part of world peace. Well, I'’m not exactly sure. I'’m torn between medical research specializing in oceanic farming and donating the money to the Humane Society. Thank you. There you have it, ladies and gentlemen, The five contestants have given us their answers. Now it'’s up to the judges to decide who will be our next Miss Slough Queen.

Aren'’t you gonna come? -No. -Oh, why not? Everybody'’s gonna be there. Well, anyone who is anyone that is. You know, Phyllis, I'’m kind of curious why you even entered this contest. You certainly don'’t seem like pageant material. I mean, you don'’t have the clothes, you don'’t have the talent, you certainly don'’t have the looks. I mean, you don'’t even have a boyfriend. Oh, unless Cameron Fishpod is your boyfriend or whatever his name is. And that'’d be worse than none at all. You really shouldn'’t have embarrassed yourself like this. It just makes it that much harder for those of us who really take this contest seriously. Oh, and I hope you don'’t even try to talk to me when you see me in public, like at the mall or something. You know why? Because you are fleshy and repulsive and have no reason to live. Why don'’t you just do us all a favor and drop dead? Hey, Phyllis, lose something?

[knocking] All right! All right, keep your shirt on. I really don'’t feel like talkin'’ to anyone right now, Cameron. Oh, come on, Phyllis, this isn'’t right. You'’re having a major depression over some stupid contest. Look, we have got to get you out of here before something awful happens. All right, come on, we'’re going bowling. Cameron, I don'’t feel like doing anything. Come on, we'’re going. Look, this is all for your own good. I thought maybe after we went bowling, we could go on down to Rapid Ready Pizza and maybe get an extra large triple with everything except anchovies, hmm? How'’s that sound? Well, I suppose I could use some nourishment. And some entertainment, come on, let'’s go. What about Eartha? She'’ll be fine, we won'’t be gone that long. Come on, let'’s go. Okay. [chatter] Well, well, well. Look who'’s going to go pig out, our little friend. Oh God, that fat pig. I will never forgive her for ruining this pageant.

[smack] ♪ [whimpering] [ripping] ♪ [whack] ♪ At the top of tonight'’s news another mysterious homicide has hit our community. Silvis Slough Queen, Elizabeth McKay was found in a remote wooded area by a group of science students collecting insects for a class project. These are the same students that found the first Miss Slough Queen, Muffy Fairlane at the Silvis Slough. The entire class is now being held for questioning at the Silvis County jail. We take you now to the Silvis County jail with our reporter, Tammi Conklin live on the scene. Tammi. Thank you, Brian. I'’m talking with Darren Hopkins, one of the students that found Elizabeth McKay. Tell me, Darren, exactly what happened when you found the body? Well, we were on a special project to collect a series of nocturnal insects that are indigenous to the wooded area near the Slough. I was going after a particularly large specimen of Orthoptera beetle when suddenly I tripped over what I thought was a dead log, and it was that girl. Well, I blew my buddy whistle, like you'’re supposed to. [abrupt whistling] When suddenly the Orthoptera landed right on her face. [chortling] You have to understand, this is an extra credit insect worth 250 points, which would take me well over an A+ for the class. The vibrations from the whistle must have startled the insect, because it went right up her nose, and became lodged deep in the sinus cavity. Well, I tried to remove the insect by clipping the nostrils in a V formation but to no avail. Then I attempted to dislodge it by administering several sharp blows to the back of the skull, thusly. [snickering] But still no luck. Taking a roll of electrical tape, I sealed the mouth of the corpse and administered a Heimlich maneuver, like so. [snickering] It was at this point in time that I grasped the ankles of the corpse firmly, and began to shake. [snickering] Having no luck with this course of action, I engaged the help of my classmates to retrieve the specimen. We began our descent into the sinus cavity, using a tweezers, a set of pliers and a Makita cordless drill. Then the police came along, causing us to give up our quest. I think we get the idea, thank you, Darren! I would like to make a public plea to the coroner to please help us retrieve our priceless specimen, and return it to me, Darren Hopkins at the earliest possible convenience, thank you. Back to you, Brian. Closed casket services for Elizabeth McKay will be held tomorrow at the First Episcopalian Church of Silvis.

Well, of course, it'’s confidential, but I-- I guess I can let you in on a bit of it. I'’m looking for a cat killer. Oh, well, take a look. Cops have already been over this thing a million times.

We'’re going out after the re-crowning tomorrow, isn'’t that great! Well, I don'’t think that'’s so great. I mean, don'’t you think it'’s kinda weird that he'’s dated Muffy and Elizabeth, and now they'’re both dead? Oh, God. You are such an extremist, Shelley. You make it sound like Paul killed them or something. Well, don'’t you think it'’s kinda strange? I mean, he started dating Elizabeth the day after Muffy was killed, and now that Elizabeth is dead, he'’s calling you up? Well, he'’s probably just lonely. After all, he is a man, and men have certain drives. Not that you would know anything about that. That'’s not funny, Alison. If you get killed, don'’t think I'’m gonna go out with him and his drives. Don'’t be a moron, Paul is one of the sweetest, kindest guys I know, and besides, he'’s totally cute. You'’re just overreacting as usual. Nothing'’s gonna happen. If you ask me, they should arrest those science geeks who just happen to be on the scene every time somebody gets killed. They'’re the ones who are doing it! I don'’t let those creeps within 100 yards of me at school. I think you'’re wrong about that. It'’s someone that no one'’s gonna suspect, someone like Paul. Stop it, Shelley! You'’re just jealous because he didn'’t ask you out. I don'’t wanna talk about this anymore, it'’s getting too weird. Besides, I have the re-crowning tomorrow. I have to get my beauty sleep, or I'’ll end up looking worse than that Phyllis Lard-ass. I'’m going to bed. All right. Goodnight. [clapping] Goodnight, Alison. But just don'’t forget I told you so. [scoffs] Where is he? Where is he! We shoulda started 10 minutes ago. God, this is so irritating. Where have you been!? We'’re tryin'’ to have a re-crowning here. It'’s pretty tough to do it without a crown! I couldn'’t get it out of her hands. Give me that! Well, now that that little piece of business is taken care of, we can get on with this. Ladies and gentlemen, may I proudly present to you the next Miss Slough Queen, Miss Alison Murphy! Smile, honey, smile! [cheering] Thank you. Tragedy has struck within our midst.

At the top of tonight'’s news, tragedy has struck for a third time in Silvis for the ill-fated Silvis Slough Queen contestants. The latest victim of the Beauty Queen Butcher is Alison Murphy. Alison was found early this morning by a group of citizens collecting aluminum cans for the Citizens for a Cleaner Silvis project. Also found on the scene was Ms. Murphy'’s boyfriend, Paul Whitewater. Whitewater was taken to the Silvis County Sheriff'’s office for questioning, then later released on his own recognizance. Our woman on top--on the go, Tammi Conklin was the the Sheriff'’s office earlier today where she gave us this report. As you see, the Sheriff'’s office is rather quiet at this time. I have with me now Mable Jones, who was at the scene this morning. Mable, can you tell us what happened? Yes, Tammi, we started out about 6 A.M. as usual to collect cans to raise money for the new fountain here in front of the court house. There were the ten of us, Merv, Carol, Fred, Ethel, Lorna, you know, the whole gang. We decided to go down by the waterfront because we can usually make quite a haul on a Saturday morning after those kids have been out drinkin'’ all night. Now that bothers me, Tammi. In my day we knew how to have fun without all the drugs, alcohol, and sex. Well, anyway, we come up on this sandbar, and that'’s when I see this girl laying on this blanket practically naked with her hair all a mess, and this big ribbon around her neck. I knew something was wrong when I pulled that beer can out of her hand, she never moved. Now that'’s when Fred found the young man lying in the car practically naked, and he called the police. The stench of alcohol was everywhere. These young people today have got to be disciplined! These terrible things happen when these young kids are allowed to roam around unsupervised. The next thing you know we'’ll have gang riots right here in Silvis. Herb, bring the car around! Thank you, Mable, for that eyewitness account. Oh, my neck. Services for Alison Murphy will be held tomorrow at Jinx Funeral Home. And in other news, Flossy and Bossy, the famous Silvis Siamese cow was seen out about town.

Our woman on the go, Tammi Conklin talked to local citizens about Phyllis Loden'’s sentencing. Phyllis Loden? Well, she was always a good tipper, unlike some other people I know! And she always got the same thing, an extra large triple with everything except anchovies. I can'’t believe she'’d do something like this. I think she was framed. Jerry, I know I have orders up! I don'’t know nothin'’ about no murders. I do know that Phyllis Loden was an artist with Jell-O. Why, we never had no interesting Jell-O, or ambrosia before she came along. Well, I'’m glad they locked her up. That woman has single-handedly destroyed all of my years of hard work to make the Silvis Slough Queen Pageant the most sought-after contest in three counties. Now no one wants to enter. It is a shattering blow. However, we are taking steps to make sure that this kind of thing never happens again. In the future, psychological testing and urinalysis will be prerequisites for any contestant.
