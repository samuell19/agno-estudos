No! So you got the e-mails that I sent you guys? - I did. - Good, so you did look at them? Yeah, it said next two animals, cover in honey, leave food out all around this town. Anyone else have service out here? I have like one bar. - Anybody? - There's no service. And there's not supposed to be service so we can bond and get to know each other. Yeah, but we're all going to die. Bad things always happen when phones don't work. Are we there yet? I can't stay in this car any longer with you. You said it was fine a couple of days ago, all right? I can't finish my paper on river ecology in a motel. Kyle, do you even know what people did before the Internet? Come on man, sex, drugs, rock and roll, my good man. Yeah, yeah they did, babe. I know we need the permits. We need to get permits at the ranger station... If we get it. Because if we don't, they'll kick us out. As local tribes fought to take back their land... the overwhelming onslaught by the Mariposa Battalion eventually lead to the repatriation... Oh yes, I like it. Wait, wait, wait. After the murder of his son, Chief Tenaya gave this tragic... Ah! What are you watching? I will be with the spirits among the rocks, the waterfalls and in the winds. - Hello? - You won't see me. - But you will fear the spirit...-Hello? Of the old chief and grow cold. - I am done. - Is that blood? An appeal to the governor John McDougal... I don't know, maybe. I think it might be. Maybe it's animal blood. Can I help you? Hi, I have five camping permits. ID? Yeah. Golden Summit Camp. That's a very sacred place. - Donna? - The guidebook said there are some old mines near here. The miners tore up the hills and the rivers, no respect for Mother Earth. Can we see one of the mines? Park's mines are closed this season. And without a guide mines are deadly. Every year, kids and all kinds of people find out the hard way. Stay out and stay alive. Make sure these are on display. Do you need any help setting up? No. We're good, thanks. Sorry, it's just that... you remind me of my daughter. Oh. She died. - Sis, I think it's time to go. - Yeah. If you would like a tour of the mines, - I could make an exception. - Thank you, but no. That would be so wonderful, thank you so much. Amy, no, thank you, goodbye. You might change your mind. I'll stop by later. I know where you'll be. We're not stay anywhere near Golden Summit. But it's all planned. You want that wacko following us there? She was going to show us the mines, guys. Yeah, and then kill us and make us play with her dead daughter. C'mon, give us somewhere else. Where can we go? Well, there's Big Rock, but it's miles away and... - Sounds great. - Big Rock. - And we'll be alive. - I like alive. Let's do alive. Blood and limbs scattered in the woods. Heads were never found. Police say the bodies were tortured and then skinned alive. Say it's a woman, probably that ranger. They say she likes young boys, Kyle, young virgin boys, peachy, soft skin. Actually, kids do go missing around here all the time, mostly hikers getting lost, but what you've really got to watch out for are the rivers. Amy, do you really think you're helping us when you say this stuff, because it's really terrifying. Donna, hey Sis, where are you going? For a walk. But it's midnight. That's why it's so dark out. I'm heading to Vista Point. Ooh, I'll come with you. No, I'd rather be alone. I have a flash light and one of Kyle's radios. I just don't really feel like being a fifth wheel. Ah, I'm sorry. Take care of her, Reese. What am I like five, Donna? Just come back and hang out. Keep the food up high, there's bears. Bears? They hardly ever come down in the foothills. Next you're going to tell me we're sleeping on an Indian burial ground. What? Yeah, the US Cavalry committed genocide clearing the land for the Gold Rush. So people died right here? All over. This whole valley was sacred to the Owani Tribe. Other tribes refused to come into the area - because of witchcraft. - Witchcraft. - I sent you a link. - Let's have a seance. -All right, that's it I'm getting out of here. I'm getting in the car. I'm going to a bar and I'm getting blacked out and I don't care what happens to you people. - Kyle, you're an atheist. - I don't care what... I was really looking forward to - spending this night with you tonight. - Wha... I've been looking forward to it ever since I came back. Yeah, but we're going to die. Well, you have fun on your own, - but I'm going to bed. - Let's go back to Fresno. I guess I'm going to be all alone. I guess one night couldn't hurt, right? - Ow! - Yeah, Kyle. - Atta boy! - I'm not tired either. - Oh. - Just so you know. - I'm not a virgin either. - I'm well aware of that. I can role play like I am though. Okay, maybe this wasn't the best idea. What was that? It's a bear. Oh, my gosh. Stay completely still. Shh, shh, shh. Don't do anything. - Oh, my God... - Woo! - Okay, out, out. - This is my special moment. - Out, out. - All right. - Good night, guys. Good night. So the mines are two miles south. Or there's an abandoned settlement in the hills. Well, there was, but you can still see the post goals. - Kyle, you don't seem excited. - What makes you think...? If you don't want to go, I can go by myself. - No, I'm always... - Do you want to go? Do you want to go? Yeah, obviously I got up this morning - and got dressed because... - Okay, should we take Donna? Donna, we're going to go see the mines, do you want to come with us? I'm sure that ranger was just being nice. Donna? She's not here. Well, maybe she took off early. It's not been slept in. I'm sure she's fine, let's go. Where is she? She didn't come back last night. I don't know. She was in a bad mood. Who knows where she is? - She probably... - Bridget! Bridget! Amy, relax, Donna is fine. She's just under a rock somewhere looking for a new fungus to name after herself. - This is serious. - Everything is serious with Donna, she's fine. Babe, come on. What was she thinking? We hardly made her feel welcome. Yeah, well she can make an effort too. How do you think she feels? Her boyfriend just left her and all her friends are back at college. Well, at least she gets to hang out with you at college, not like me, I'm stuck in Fresno. Kyle, not now, we're supposed to be looking for Donna. Baby, I can't. She's jinxed me. She wouldn't sulk for this long. I swear it's so unfair. She gets all of the attention and all I ever get are her hand-me-downs. Babe, come on, it'll be okay. Okay, okay? I hate working at the salon. It takes everything I have not to just drive my scissors into some fat old witch's neck and I'm going to be stuck there forever. I know it. Oh my God, wait? Have you heard back yet? - About what? - The fire service application, it's been two weeks since your interview. No, nothing yet. I think background checks, all that HR BS you know. God, that would literally change our lives, a steady job. Wow, now with money and benefits, you are all mine. Oh, I like this job after all. You think she got this far at night? I mean how far is Vista Point? I knew we should have checked on her. Look, nothing's happened to her. She's fine. But she didn't come back, Kyle. - If she's not at Vista Point, we'll call the ranger station, all right? - They... - There's something out there. Don't you feel it? - Amy, you skanky hoe. Answer your walkie. Tell me you found her. No, no sign of her, we're heading for Vista Point. All right, we're right behind you, we'll meet you there. Donna, I know you're listening stop being a princess. I swear to God if you're just sulking, when I find you, I'm going to kill you. Donna, Donna? I'm not kidding. We should call the ranger station. What's the reception on the radio? It's about three miles, but down here, whoa! Kyle, Kyle! - Kyle! - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Don't move, don't move. Don't come any closer, okay? There's a hole. Stay up there, okay? Reese, Reese, Kyle has fallen down a hole. We're at the bottom of a ravine, just past the stream on the trail map. Hold tight, we'll be there in a minute. Just stay still, relax. You good? Yeah, shh. - Donna? Donna! - Donna, are you down there? I don't know, something's down there. We don't know it's her. What if Donna's down there, honestly? What if she's not? Please stop, it's dangerous. It's dangerous? I mean we've been looking everywhere, right? That's why we should go get the rangers. Reese, I'll go get the rangers, don't go down. Shh, I'm going to go look, okay. This is Donna, our friend. I'll be right back up, okay? Go, go, go. Careful, babe, careful, careful. Donna, Reese is coming. Whoa. Oh, Donna? Reese? Reese! Donna! She's here, she's here! She's down here! - Reese, Reese. - Reese, is she okay? - Oh my God, your leg. - Is she okay? I'm okay, I'm okay. It's just stuck, I can't get out. You guys have to come down here. - Kyle, Kyle, get down here! - Go! No! Kyle, don't, mines can be full of toxic gases, rattle snakes, bears, anything. - Go! - No, Kyle. Look, I don't want to go down there, but I have to. It's okay, we're here, okay? Just breathe, okay? I'm going to take a look. I have been trying all night, - but I just can't get it out. - I know, it's okay. Donna, breathe, we are here, okay? - We are here, it's okay. - Okay. Donna, are you okay? Yeah, yeah, we're fine, it's just got some I just it... looks a lot worse than it is. Donna, oh my God, Donna, I swear I thought you were just being dramatic. I was a total bitch. I'm so sorry. No, no, you are not a bitch. I'm an idiot. I went for a walk on my own in the dark. We need to call the ranger station. Donna's trapped, over. Oh my God, is she going to be okay? Reese, can you find a pull or something? Maybe we can move the leg? I'll go look. No, no, just, just get help. Amy, we need to get the ranger. Donna's trapped. I'm coming with you, don't go anywhere. No, stay with Donna, I'll be way quicker on my own. No, did you hear what I said? Don't leave until I'm up there. Reese? - I'm going. - What? Amy, come on, you can't go on your own. Bridget, I'll be so much faster on my own, all right? It'll take me three hours top and I get the rangers. But I'm here, I can go with you. No, you're going to be okay. Just stay and don't go inside. - I mean it. - Okay. Guys, guys, you got to come in here. Donna, come on. All right, Donna, have it your way. - Bridge. - Oh my God, Donna, I am so sorry, this is all my fault. - It's okay, it's okay. - Oh my God, your leg! - It's not... - Oh, it's so bad. - Everything's going to be okay. - Why are you smiling? - None of this is funny, Donna. - Kyle! Kyle, Kyle show her. - Come here, Bridget. - What? - Go! - Come here. -I don't want to go. - Go. - Okay, all right. It's good, go. Yeah, you're not going to believe this, yeah. What? Guys, what? What is this place? I don't like it. Babe? Guess what we found. A cold, dark, stinky hole. Put out your hand, seriously just trust me. - Oh my God, is that...? - Gold, it's gold. It's actually real. - It's pretty cool, huh? - No more alarm clocks. No more job sites. Welcome to Neverland, Wendy! Okay, get a room, you guys. - Room? More like a suite Kyle, woo! - Yes! Hey are they going to let us keep it? - Who? - The rangers. Amy already went to go get them. - Wait, what? - She went for help. - She's gone already? - Yeah. - Oh no. - No. - No, no, no, no. - No, if the rangers find this place we lose everything. Donna, Donna, radio Amy! Amy, come in, Amy over. - Stop it! - Don't mention the gold over the radio. We won't, we won't. - Get out of the way. - Shut up. Amy, Amy do you hear me? I'm not getting a signal down here. We're in a ravine, we're low. We're not going to get anything down here, so you've got to get as high as you can, all right, we're really low, - you got to get a better signal up there. - I'm going to go. I'll go after Amy. Guys, come on, what's going on, anybody? Hello? Are you sure you just don't want to go get help? Look, Bridge, this is serious, serious money. What happened to you? You don't need money that bad. Nothing. I know you're hiding something. I'm not hiding anything. I'm just broke, like drop out of college, move back in with you and mom broke, you want that? No way. What? The smell of nail polish, the weird food cravings, being moody with me and Reese all summer, you're pregnant? Oh my God, no way! Oh my God, oh my God, Donna, the fall, what about the baby? I'm not bleeding, it's fine. Do not say anything, please don't say anything. Oh my God, mom is going to freak out. What about Paul? Oh is that why he left you? Oh, I'm so sorry. No, I'm sorry for everything. Hey, it's okay. You are not alone. We can do this. You're having a baby. - Yeah. - Maybe I could have a baby. Me and Reese would have such cute kids. No wonder you were being so weird about drugs. Seriously, I thought you joined a cult or something. Drop it, okay. I haven't exactly wrapped my head around this whole situation. It wasn't planned. Are you going to keep it? - Bridge. - Sorry. Here, distract yourself. I want to see what's down there, will you take some pictures? - Sure. - Stop looking at it. Okay. All right, I'll be back. Be careful. It's an old shovel, take a picture, wouldn't want to miss that. It's a trough thing with a handle. God, how old do you think this place is? It must be Gold Rush, like 1850s. Hey, think anybody knows about it? Reese says it ends at the seam. Hey, hold on, I think I found something. What? I don't know. I think it's a saddle bag. Hey, there's something inside. Stop! Amy? Amy, over? Amy? It's a book. It looks like a diary. What's wrong? Why would you leave a diary? Why would you write one? Saddo. Amy? Amy, over? Amy! What? What? Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. No, no, no! Amy? Yes, yes. Amy? While you're down there. Stop. - I don't get it. - It's pretty simple. The heavier elements sink to the bottom as you agitate the concentrate. I mean, really we should be doing this in a stream, but since this is totally illegal, we have to improvise. See? Gold. Are you sure about this? Amy, okay, how much student debt are you going to have after you graduate? And is your hippie do-gooder job even going to make a dent in it? It still feels wrong. It's just sitting here. It would be wrong not to take it. I set up all the tents. Now we'll look like just a normal bunch of campers. We got the jack from the car. No, let's let the swelling go down. Okay. You need help? No, I got it. Amy, I can feel you looking at me. It's one night. Nothing bad is going to happen and when we do this we are set for life. Trust me, I'm a cosmetologist. - So rich. - I know. Do you realize what we can buy with this? - What you can buy? - I'm going to buy a sports car, vroom vroom. I'm going to buy, oh there we go I'm going to buy a mansion. I got to get a mansion next to... Where's our mansion, a mansion? - Maybe two mansions. - Maybe... maybe a diamond ring for your girlfriend? Now come on, I never said anything about that. No diamond ring. Oh my God, boy, you smell. Smell like success, baby, come on! Yeah, successful bear repellent, get off, get off. Come on, don't spray that shit. I smell like a 12-year-old girl now. Okay, here we go, here we go. I change my mind. Too late, as soon you're out, I'm driving you to the hospital. I'm a nurse, I am the hospital. Reese, are you sure you know what you're doing? Just trust me, okay? Just trust me, all right, let's do this. All right. It's working. Yes, yes, it's working, it's working. Kyle! Kyle, I need you. - Kyle, I need you. - No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no! Drake, I'm going to go inside and find those campers. I'll take a look at the big one. There's a hell of a storm coming this weekend. I have to close the park. Copy that, kids are selfish, but we need to warn them anyway. Good night, Drake. Take care, Sam. - Oh my gosh, Donna. - Are you okay? - Oh my God, Donna, I'm so sorry. - Back off! - What about your leg? - Give me a second, okay? It's okay, it's just pinched. It's just pinched. I'm going to get the ranger. - Reese! - I'm going to go with you, Amy! - She said she's okay. - No one is going anywhere. Okay? You guys are going to keep digging and then when you're finished you'll get the hell out of here and go get me a rescue. I won't say anything. They will never know how much gold we took. - That's crazy. - That's the plan. That's the plan. Not in here! Okay? - What is wrong with you? - Seriously? Seriously, Amy? You know what? We can't keep her down here. - It'll take days. - There's no arguing with her when she's like this. It's just you have to do what she wants. I'm right here. I'm going to go get firewood. I've got painkillers. Stop looking at me like that. - Boo! - Did she calm down yet? - Yeah. When are you going to get Amy under control? She's got you working here, working there, taking orders, what is that? What is that? Dude, you're a man. Put her in her place. We need this. You need this. Yeah, well, you're going to be fine, all right? You're going to be a firefighter. There's always busy with the wild fires around here. You can cheat on Bridget all you want. You're going to be golden. I'm not going to be a firefighter. - It's not happening. - What? I took a drug test. Let's think about that, Kyle. I took a drug test. What do you think it came back as? What are you going to tell Bridget? Sure, Kyle, hmm, oh yeah, hey, Bridget, yeah like I'm going to tell Bridget. We're going to work this out. You're going to take care of your grandma. It's going to be great. Positive, positively awesome. You take care of Amy. I'll take care of the rest. Want some? I'm paranoid enough. We learned about it on that old country field trip - in eighth grade. - Oh, eighth grade! I remember everything from eighth grade. What I remember from eighth grade is stinky Vicky stinking up the classroom every time. I remember... Guys? Guys? Reese? - Donna! - What is it, - what is it? - Donna, Donna, hey! - Hey, look at me. - Donna! Donna, Donna, look at me. Donna. It's just the mine, nothing. Nothing? God, you almost gave me a heart attack. Can we please go get the rangers now? We've already talked about this. I'm good till tomorrow okay? Hey look the diary it's all wet. It has writing on it. Massacre? Chusetts, chusetts, Massachusetts. That would be crazy though. Let's soak it, see what else is on there. Wow, this is so cool. God, we are in a gold mine and you get excited about paper. No, this could be historically significant. I might get extra credit on my thesis. Your thesis? Amy, we're going to be rich. You don't have to do your paper. I still haven't gotten to it actually. No wonder you like that weirdo ranger so much. Hey, maybe you could like join her coven. Bridget, you're such a bitch. Oh, she called me a bitch. - Look what I've got with me! - Way to go, Amy! This isn't the club, you don't need to smoke weed, bro. What's your problem? I don't have a problem. We just, we got to get out of here, all right? - Let's just go down and... - Amy is a danger. What's wrong with you? Nice. Ah, ow! What about you, Kyle? What are you going to do with all this money? You know, maybe I'll put a down payment on a Volvo or something. A Volvo? What are you, a 40-year-old stepdad? Jesus! Hey, they're safe. They're still reliable. Amy, what about you, Amy? What are you going to do? To be honest, I haven't really thought about it. I really need to finish my thesis. What? No, you don't. You don't have to finish anything anymore. You're going to be rich. You don't have to do any of that stuff. - But I want to. - You want to? - Guys? - Oh, it's your turn. I'm going to fix a cup of tea. - Fine. Have fun. What about you? What are you going to do with the money? Don't, don't tell Amy, okay? I actually want to go to college and study fashion in New York. - Good for you. - Yeah? - Don't worry. I'm not gonna say anything to her. - Really? Is that what I think it is? Oh my God! OK, Amy why are you bringing that out here? There's an Indian tradition that you're supposed to rub this on your lumber. That's why we need to keep you away from these books. - Oh God! - Come back! I'm part native. I don't care if you're part native, because we're living in America. You're quiet, you all right? I'm just tired. It's mostly just numbers, some random notes in the margins, some Shakespeare quotes. "We are such stuff as dreams are made on and our little life is rounded with a sleep." No TV back then, I guess. They sailed from New York to Panama, then North to San Francisco. They hired local Indians as guides and miners. One died of cholera. Ew. Employed this day washing with Rocker, got about $15. That was a lot back then. What's the very last entry? September 2nd, all this day raining. Wow that was a real page turner. Reese? What? You okay? What do you want? We should split up the gold. Why, you think I'm going to steal it? No, it's just if we're caught down here, we'll lose everything. We should hide it. We ain't going to get caught. Get back to work. What the... Where's the gold? - Did you hide it? - What? Where did the gold go, did you hide it? What did you say? The gold is gone, are you listen... This is the opportunity of a lifetime and you are losing it, you're losing it. You need to stay with it. Get back to work, Kyle. It's worth a million dollars. Wow, I never even dreamed I would see that kind of money. Ah, I feel like really crap. Let me see your leg. Oh my God, Donna, that looks so much worse - than it did before. - It's not that bad. - Yes, it does? - Oh, what the hell? I'm going to go get help. No, she's going to be fine. Fine? She's throwing up. She's going into shock. Bridget, reason with her, please. She is not going into shock. It's morning sickness, she's pregnant. - What? - She's freaking out, don't you understand? - What about the baby? That's crazy. - Amy, the baby is okay. - I know what I'm doing. - You're supposed to be the smart one. - I need the money. - Then take mine. That kid needs a mom, please. She's right, Sis. We have way more than we need. It's not like we're leaving with nothing. Okay, okay. I'll start clearing the tents. No, we can't leave tonight. We have to clean up. It has to look like you guys were never here, just me. I can take another night. - Are you sure? - Yes. Don't say anything about the baby. Okay, tomorrow morning. I will go tell the guys. Donna's foot has gotten so much worse. We all talked and we're going to leave in the morning. What? We are not leaving. The seam was getting thicker. Did you not hear me? We're leaving at first light. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. We'll go to the nearest town. We'll get a heavy duty jack and lift it off. No, after last time, absolutely not. Fine, we'll use crimming then. I learned it when I was training with the firefighters. We do not need rangers. You need to tell her that. This is not a debate. We are leaving. You're walking away from this? His plan will work, Bridget. Shut up, Kyle, nobody asked you. We have to leave. We have plenty. All right. Yeah? If that's what you decided. Look, I am exhausted. Let's just go up. Let's get cleaned up. Let's go for a swim, yeah? You can go. I'm going to keep working. I'm not swimming by myself. Why don't you take Amy? What is Amy doing right now? Kyle and I are working. Take Amy, she's useless. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey. You are such an asshole. Yeah, I'm the asshole. Bridget, Bridget, I'm sorry. Bridget. Douchebag. Bridget, I'm sorry. You know what? Just forget it. I'm going to bed on my own. Bridget, wait! Bridget, come on, seriously, Bridget! Smart move. Bridget, come on. What's up? I'm okay. I just don't understand why anyone would walk off and just leave a pure seam of gold. It doesn't make sense. No one would leave all this mining equipment. It would have cost a fortune back then. I mean look, September 2nd, all this day raining, nothing else. Maybe they were ambushed. By what? Don't tell Bridget, but it says that one of the miners stabbed an Indian. In here? Did he die? It doesn't say. It gets really sparse. I don't think they were paying the Indians either and it was like a slave labor situation. And, they started to steal from each other and take all the money. It got really dark. Can we please just leave? It all feels wrong. Come on, Ames, I really need this. You need to leave. First light, I promise. Woo! Reese? Reese? Reese? Reese? Reese? You are so bad, you jerk. We'll pack up when we get back. Really? Yeah, we're done. I love you. Amy? What's wrong? There's something down here. It looked like a man. - Where? - It went through the wall. - Okay. - I'm getting out, I'm getting out. I'm getting out. - No, there's nothing here. It's okay. - No! No, it's not okay. I saw something and it looked like a miner. Listen to yourself, you're tired, you're seeing... I know what I saw, okay? We're leaving. - Get off! - We can't leave Donna. I'm getting Reese, he'll listen to me. You can't go on your own. Let's just get some fresh air, you'll feel much better. I can't leave Donna. Okay, okay. Is that better? There's something down there. Look, be rational, Amy. This is sacred land. My God, stop it. I can see one. Look there's nothing the... We're not going to last the night. I found you. Out for a walk in the moonlight? No, yes. What? The moon, it's so bright. You don't even need a flash light. You all right? Yeah, sure. You're all covered in dirt. We're fine. What do you want? Well, that's not very polite. You'll give Fresno a bad name. Let's start over. I'm Susanna. I didn't get what they call you. Kyle. Hey, Kyle. I hate guns, don't you? I wish we never needed them. Are those your tents down in the ravine? Not the best place to camp, bottom of a gully. Well, listen, I was really looking for your friend Donna. The permits are in her name and they need updating. There's a storm warning in effect and if we have to close the park, we need to know where you all are. Now your permits were only for Golden Summit and you're not there. - Now? - Yeah. I have them with me. I parked up at Vista Point. It won't take long. The storm will probably blow over, but better to be safe. This is serious. Don't you see? Try to She's asleep. We'll give her them later. The light's on. She's afraid of the dark. I don't see your permits. You're supposed to hang them on your tent so we know you're legal. But you know we've got them. You issued them. Well, you don't have to get like that. I was just saying. Listen, Susanna, we'll get Donna to update the permits in the morning. If you're still willing to give us a tour of the mines, we'd love to see them. I'm sure it would cheer Donna up. She's been having a really hard time since her boyfriend broke up with her. Oh. Well, if we're not rained out, I guess that would be okay. As long as you come first thing in the morning. We will, thank you. I'll see you at 8:00 a.m. sharp. Okay, 8:00 a.m. Thank you. We'll see you tomorrow. Okay. Cancer. Sorry? The sign you were born under. Cancer. Hey, what are you guys doing up here? Why aren't you digging? This is Ranger Susanna. She's dropping off some permits. Hi. You can just call me Susanna. Well then, we're all off to bed. - Good night. - Yeah, I'm tired. Thanks for coming by, Susanna. Do you know I just had this dream that Donna was hurt and she needed my help. It's a crazy dream. She's awake, the light just went off. Help, help! Donna! - Help! - No, stop! Don't go in there! Fuck! Oh, oh! Is she dead? Amy, we need you down here. I'm not going down there, okay? - Guys, what are we going to do? - What do you mean? - We're going to call the police. - We can't call the police. There's a dead body down here. But it was an accident. You pushed her, didn't you? She wanted a piece of the action, - so you murdered her. - What? That's what they're going to say. - Nobody is going to believe us. - Bury her, we'll bury her. We can't bury her. People don't exactly have accidents and then bury themselves. We'll throw her down the mountain then. She slipped, right? It's kind of true. - I don't want to be a part of this. - You already are a part of this. Why didn't you tell her to go away? She was the one screaming. Because you left me alone in the pitch black. - You were asleep. - With no light. There was light. Why won't you do this? Wait, there's two more bags. We needed a break, Amy had... Where, there's eight there? - What? There were ten. - Where's the gold, what have you done with it? - Nothing, it's just... - Just stop lying. - Stop it! - I'm not lying. Amy had to get out. She was seeing things. What did she see? A miner. A miner? Boo! Will you stop it? We have enough problems already. Guys, where's the ranger? She heard everything. Hey are you, okay? Hey, we'll cut you a deal. Amy, Amy, stop her, don't let her go! Amy, don't let her go! Stop her! - Where's my gun? - Stop her, Amy! Where's my gun? You're alive? You're alive? No, no, no, don't go. - I was just trying to help. - No, no, don't go, we can share the gold. I don't want the gold. It belongs to the Earth. You shouldn't have touched it. No, you can't go, don't leave. It's cursed. Hello? Susanna? Hello? I just want to talk. I'm not going to hurt you. Susanna? I have your gun. Amy! Stop! Amy! Amy! - Oh my God! - Amy! Amy! Amy! No, no. She's okay. - She's okay. - Oh my God! Search her. What? Search her for the gold. Reese, I think we're beyond that. What if somebody finds two bags of gold? I don't care. I'm going to the police. I'm telling them what's happened. I'm telling them everything. No, no, you can't go to the police because now we're all accessories. Bridget, we have to before things get any worse. Things can't get any worse, Kyle. I said to search her. Reese! What are you doing? Search that bitch. You've got to be fu... I'm not going to jail because of Amy. I am looking out for each and every one of us. Does nobody understand that? It's not here. Give me your walkie. You take her to the mine, you search for the bags. I got to watch him. Amy, go to the police, go to the... Please do not test me right now, Kyle. Drag her to the mine like I asked. - Amy, you got to get up, you got to get up for Kyle, okay? - Oh, my God! Drop her. That is so wrong. Donna, please, it'll only get worse. We've got to tell the police. We are not sending Amy to prison because of some freak ranger. We'll all be dead by the morning. Reese will cut us up and take everything. Amy shot the ranger, not me. You need to calm down. You both need to shut up about the ranger. We don't need them. We get me out using the car. Once I'm out, we cave in the mine. All evidence I was ever here is gone. Yeah, that'll work. We have a tow in the trunk. We'll wind it around the wheel. You're both crazy! You owe me two bags of gold. Get her out of here. You heard me. - I can't leave him. - Give me the gun. Give me the gun. I'll get Bridget. I can't find anything. Are you sure there were two other bags of gold? I'm so sorry. It was an accident. What am I going to do? Amy, I am trying to help you. If the police find the gold before we do, they're going to know exactly what we've been doing. Bridget, I need you. I can't go back down. It's cursed. She said it was cursed. The ranger, it's a trap, Bridget. I'm not going back down. - Hey. - Don't make me go back down. You have to, for Kyle. Reese? Reese, we're here come here. Reese, please let Kyle go. Why? Why would I let Kyle go? So he can go to the police. So he can send you to prison. Do you know what they would do to a doll like you on the inside? Did you find the bags? No, it's dark, it's rainy. - I couldn't find anything. - All right. I need to go get the car. We're going to winch the rock off Donna. - Are you sure? - It's our only option. We can't exactly have a ranger down here now. Shit. I'm so sorry, it's all my fault. Shut up, Amy. Watch Kyle while I'm gone. What? No! I'm not touching that, absolutely not. Fine, I'll stay, you get the car. I'm not going to find it in a storm. It's pitch black out there. Then what? I'll go. I got us into this. Yeah, she knows exactly where the car is. Just send Amy. I swear to God, if you do anything. Why would I bring anyone here? I shot the ranger. If I sense any funny business. Do you understand me? Look at me when I'm talking to you! Give me the walkie. See you soon, Amy. - Just hurry. - Don't let him hurt anyone. He's not actually serious. - Bridget! - Go! Donna, I'll be back. - I'm gonna get you out. - Amy, what are you doing? - I'm gonna get you out, Donna. - What are you doing? - I know I can. - Why? Just think for a second. It's happening again. They drowned, Donna! They drowned. It's water. What is that? September 2nd, all this day raining. We'll all be drowned. I'm not going to drown. Help, please! We have got to get out of here right now. - Susanna, this is Ranger Drake, where are you? You haven't checked in. You copy? Hope you're safe, Susanna. I'm worried about you. Over. The mine is flooding. The reason there is so much gold is the miners never left. They drowned! Stay there! The seam was not hidden by the wood. It was drift wood. It washed up in the flood. Please, Reese, you have to get me out of here. Please, I am begging you. - Amy's getting the car. - We don't have time for Amy to get the car. Reese, I will be under water before she gets back. It's getting really deep. Reese, baby, just listen to her. Please, come on, we have enough. I want all of it. All of it! August 8th, seam getting bigger. August 12th, two bags of gold missing, Blake shot over missing gold. We are becoming them. Don't you get it? That is why there is so much gold. We've been digging in a tomb. Donna needs your help. She needs help! Back off! It is a tomb. Oh! Ranger Drake, do you copy? Bridget, go! Help, police, help anybody, we need a rescue! We're near Vista Point! Where's my gun? Do you copy? Repeat. Help, please, we're at the bottom of the mine, at the bottom of the ravine between Vista Point and our camp site. Can anybody hear me? Hello, can you hear me? - No, no, Reese, no, don't! - Can anybody hear me? I said shut up! What? Oh my God! Hold the bag! - Bridget, Bridget! - He's dead! - Bridget! - Oh, Jesus Christ, Donna! - You have to help me. - Okay. I can't get it, I can't get it. Bridget, you have to do something to my heel. No, no, no, I can't do that, please. - You have to, I am going to drown, okay? - Okay. Put your hands here, we're going to do it together. Bridget, you got this, okay. One, two, three, now! I said to load the gold. - She's drowning. - Load it! Please, she's going to drown. Stop it! Reese, you're sick, you need help. Just please, she's pregnant. I don't care. Load the gold. Reese, it's yours, Reese, it's yours. - What? - I'm sorry. Oh my God! I'm so sorry. Bridget, I'm so sorry. I was just trying to help. You take everything from me. What? No! Stop! Reese, stop, she's going to drown. Take the gold out now. Okay, okay, I will. Help her! I'm sorry, Bridget. Reese, help me. Reese! Yes, there you are. I will shadow your footsteps as one of the spirits of the rocks, the waterfalls, the rivers and the winds. I will be with you. You will not see me, but you will feel the spirit of the old chief and grow cold. The great spirit is with you. Reese, please, what is wrong with you, Reese? Reese, please, don't let me die. Please don't let me die. You're already dead. Reese, Reese, it's cursed, it's cursed. The Indians are all around us, I can see them. - Bridget, pull me up! - Reese, it's cursed. They're never going to let you leave with that gold. Pull! Donna, Donna! Reese, that is my sister, go help her! - Pull up! Donna! Go help her! Pull, pull up! Come on! No. - Pull! Pull! - Come on. Pull! - I can't. Come on, pull! No, Donna! No! Reese! I heard on the walkie. I don't know what you've been through, but I can tell it was fierce. Sometimes these woods have a mind of their own. I need to find my partner. I need to find Susanna. Can you tell me where she is? Can you take me to her? Show me. Donna, hurry, come on, grab my hand. We have to go now. Donna, Donna, give me your hand, come on we got to go. Grab my hand we have to go now, come on. - What are you doing? - I can make it. No, no, no, no, Donna, it's cursed! Don't you get it? The Indians are all around us. - I can see them. - It's all in your head. Donna, we are being judged. They have given us every opportunity to leave and we have stayed out of greed. If we stay, we die. Donna, we have to go. It's almost there Give me your hand. Gotcha! It's too late. It's too late! Bridget, Bridget, Bridget, Bridget! No! Help, no! Where are they? They're all dead. No! The overwhelming onslaught eventually led to the repatriation and dislocation of the natives. After the murder of his son, Chief Tenaya have this tragic curse. You may kill me, but you shall not live in peace. I will be with the spirits among the rocks, the waterfalls and in the winds. You will not see me, but you will fear the spirit of the old chief and grow cold. I am done.
