Oh! Though we have faith and reasonable hope for forgiveness, we must each face the fact that our actions create a banquet of consequences. In your case you may think this is a mean supper, but you chose it. If your mother were alive, she'd think this is best. Whatever father said to you, don't take it to heart. Kent and I have a little present for you for later. You'll be late for the train. ...Colorado Springs... ...Aboard for Denver, Colorado Springs is here... If you're traveling out of town, have tickets... Chicago what? Hey! Watch your step, Miss. Thank you. There you go. Olivia? ...Take care, buddy. I'm Reverend Case. Hello. My dear, you look just like your mother. I was so sorry to hear she passed away. Thank you. Oh, is this it? For now, yes. Well, we have quite a little drive ahead of us. Do you need to use the station services? Yes, please. Pardon me. Out here they grow mostly grains, a bit of sugar beets, and vegetables. No gasoline shortage for farmers. They get all they want. No sugar shortage, either. That's nice. You must be Olivia. Yes ma'am. How do you do? Mr. Singleton's in the parlor. Mr. Ray Singleton, this is Miss Olivia Dunne. Livy. Everyone calls me Livy. Ray's sister's waiting in the church. Well, we'll just leave you two to get acquainted a moment. Raymond, why don't you pour some lemonade for Livy? Yes, ma'am. We'll be in the church when you're ready. Thank you. Mr. Singleton... Ray... please. Ray. Uh... Now that you've had a chance to meet me, to see me in person, do you have any doubts? N-No, ma'am. Are you, uh... Are you having second thoughts? No. Do you think you'll be able to love the baby? Oh, I do. Is there anything that you'd like to ask me? No. You're so fine, I can't believe no man... I can't believe any man would ever do this to you. And do you, Raymond, take Olivia to be your lawful wedded wife? I do. The rings? Uh, I didn't. I don't have a ring. I don't... I don't need one... Fine. Bound by these sacred bonds, may you vow to imitate Christ in your new life together. To give one another hope when there is sorrow, strength when there is weakness, faith and understanding when there is confusion or doubt. In such a love, we are sustained on this earthly life, just as we hope for eternal life through our Savior, Jesus Christ. Amen. I now pronounce you man and wife. Martha, Hank, if you'd please sign as witnesses. Congratulations, Ray. Thank you. I'm Martha. I'm Ray's sister. Pleased to meet you. This is my husband, Hank. Hi. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Congratulations, Ray. We hesitated to bring the children today. Thought we'd give you a chance to settle in, and... Oh, Ray, hold on. Just a sec. This is a little casserole for supper. I thought you must be tired from all your traveling. Thank you. That's very thoughtful. Now Ray, you bring Olivia over to see us real soon, okay? Well, welcome to the family, huh? Who are your neighbors? Hmm? Your neighbors... who are they? Uh, well, my sister. She and Hank live eight miles thataway. Here. Thank you. Is that garden your mother's? Uh, yes it was. Someone sounds unhappy. Uh, it's just the dog. I put him in the shed so he won't jump on you. Thank you. Uh... Welcome home. Kitchen's there. There some, uh, Coca-Colas in here. No, thank you. Uh, this was Martha's room, and... um... This was my parents' room where you'll be staying. Will this be all right? Mm-hmm. Uh, let's see... This is the bunk room. You have a brother? Well, I do. Well, I did. Daniel got killed at Pearl Harbor. This is the bathroom. Indoor plumbing. Got your hot water, cold water. I just put that in. Where's the telephone? Well, there's a phone box in Wilson, outside the post office. Tomorrow, I'll get anything you want to stock the kitchen. I don't really know how to cook. I mean I could; I just haven't really tried. I can cook a fair bit. My sister could come over and teach you. No, it's fine, you know, it shouldn't be that hard. I can get a book from the library. Is there a library? Oh, yeah, in La Junta. That's an hour away. Yeah, about that. The Reverend said you'd had lots of schooling. I was in graduate school, studying archeology. My college thesis was Heinrich Schliemann's excavation of Troy. Is he German? Yes. Is he a Nazi? No, he... he lived in the 19th century. Oh, I can... No, sit. Uh, Mrs. Pratt, from church, she, uh, she makes me a cake nearly every week. This one's, uh... chocolate, I think. Can I cut you a slice? No, thank you. We'll save it, then. Ray... um... I was just wondering... why you agreed to this. When the reverend come out to see me and told me about your situation... well, I thought... I thought... maybe it'd be God's will. God's will. You want anything else? No, thank you. Farmers get to bed early. You have everything you need? Yes. Thank you. All right. Good night. Good night. Oh... Good morning. Morning. I can't believe I slept so late. You needed your rest. Franklin! No. Hey. Come here. Come here. He won't hurt you. Good boy. I thought I'd drive into La Junta today. Maybe look around town. Let the family know that I'm here. Could I borrow the truck? Oh, well, uh, the beet box has a mind of its own. The beet box. I use that truck to haul my beets. Right. It's best if I drive you over. Oh, I'm, I'm sure you have things you need to do. No bother. I'm glad to do it. Just, uh, get my library card, in case you want to check out some cookbooks. Are those tomatoes? Potatoes. Some of the fields are empty. You bet. Why? Well, we harvested the first cash crop. Winter wheat. Next we'll harvest them beets and those potatoes. May I help? I doubt it. You're right. I... I don't know anything about farming. You got the house to take care of. You need any change? Uh, no, I have it. Thank you. I'll be in the library. Are you expecting a little one? Yes, ma'am. We are. Well, how wonderful. Yes, ma'am. Do you have any books on Henry Schliemann? Is that S-H or S-C-H? Your guess is better than mine. I think he was an archeologist. Let me have a look. If father wanted to punish me, he's done a great job. Oh, Livy, don't cry. Oh, hon, is he horrid? No. No. Livy, if he mistreats you for even one second, I'm coming to get you. Abby, is there any word from Edward? No. Oh, Livy, remember, this isn't forever. I know. All right now, the clutch tends to stick. You gotta ease off slow. There you go. Shift, shift. Give it a pump. That's it. This is easy. Now, the gas gauge says full, but it isn't. You gotta hit it just right, it'll tell you the truth for one split second, then it shoots right back up there to full. Where do I hit it? Uh, right there. Just give it a pop. Quick like. That's it. We have half a tank. The gas can's in the back, just in case. Wow, look at that. Are they Japanese? Watch the road. They're from Camp Amache. That's an internment camp. Yes, it is. Farms are short-handed. The government needs the food, so they send the workers. They work your farm? Our farm. Yes, they do. ♪ For the beauty of the Earth ♪ ♪ For the glory of the skies ♪ ♪ For the love which from our birth ♪ ♪ Over and around us lies ♪ ♪ Lord of all to Thee we raise ♪ ♪ This our hymn of grateful praise ♪ ♪ Lord of all to Thee we raise ♪ ♪ This our hymn of grateful praise ♪ ♪ Amen. ♪ Lord, we pray for the relief of suffering and an end to war throughout the world.

Oh, my. Yes, it is. I bet it was. Well, Ray, are you going to introduce us? Yes, ma'am. Miss Parker, this is my wife, Livy. Your wife? Well, how do you do? Nice to meet you. Your wife! I'm Miss Parker. I've known Ray since he was this high. And this is Mrs. Pratt. Goodness me. We never knew. So pleased to meet you. And Martha never said a word. Yes, aren't we all blessed? Sweetheart, will you help me at the table? Bye. Bye. You must not be from here. We've been so worried about Ray. The way things have played out here. And not a single young women to speak of. And Ray's such a fine, young man. How'd you meet? How'd you meet? I eloped... Uh, we met in Denver. How romantic. I never knew you traveled to Denver. You come sit by me at the potluck. We'd like stay, but we gotta get on. But we're really gonna enjoy your cake, Miss Pratt, thank you. You're most welcome. You're very welcome. Good-bye. Bye-bye. I just have a letter I need to drop at the post office. It's Sunday. I could mail it for you tomorrow. Oh, it already has a stamp on it. I'm just going to drop it in the box to my sister. Can you swim here? It's right shallow for swimming. There's two feet of silt down there. You like to swim? I used to. I used to love to swim. Thank you for lying to Mrs. Pratt. Middle of the day's not the best time for fishing. Being out here is the point. Fishing's... just an excuse, I suspect. Excuse us. No, I'm sorry. What, what were you studying? Um... butterflies. Do you collect? No. We log our observations in our notebook. I'm Livy. I-I live in the farmhouse. We were just getting back to work. No, wait, wait. What did I cause you to miss? What were you... What kind of butterfly did you see? It was a Common Blue. There! Are, are there many species here? Yes, hundreds. Like what? Silver-Spotted Skippers... Mourning Cloaks, Hawkmoths... Mm-hmm. Specklewoods. May I see your book? These are beautiful. Thank you. Look... there. What is it? A Sulphur... some species of Sulphur. Shoo! Shoo! I'm sorry. Franklin, no! He's your dog? No. Well... uh, are-are you thirsty? We should get back to work. Come to the house anytime. We have cold colas in the icebox. Thank you. Wait! What are your names? Rose Umahara. And Florie. Bye. Bye. Go away, Franklin. Go away. I'm almost four months pregnant. Yes, that's what I would have guessed. It was a mistake. When the baby arrives, you won't see it as a mistake anymore. I'd like to believe you. Then do so, Mrs. Singleton. Well, I'd say we're looking at the third week of December. A Christmas baby. Mmm. While we're in town, I need to mail a letter. Everything go all right? Everything's right on schedule. Did he say when the baby was coming? December. I could have told you that before. People will know. People will know the baby's early. What will they think, then? I don't care what people think. I don't see how you could be immune. People judge, people gossip. They won't say a thing. And why is that? Well... they want the best for us. Smells good. A fiesta omelet. Maybe I put too many jalapeño peppers in it. No, it's real good. Real good cooking. The cheese... I forgot the cheese. It might mellow it; hold on. What is that? That'll be Hank. What's that, what's that sound? It's the Claw. What are you doing with that thing? Thanks. You said you like to swim. Dig you a hole so summertimes, you and the children can go swimming. "Children"? Aunt Livy! Hi! Hi. Hey, I hope you don't mind us coming along. The boys couldn't miss it. Hank. It's not every day somebody digs a hole. That one that flew by there, that's Chester, and this is Hank Jr. Hello, Hank Jr. Hi, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Do you like my hair? You look lovely. She asked me to do it up just like yours. Hank, Honey, keep a watch on your brother. Make sure he doesn't get under that thing. Here, Franklin, here, boy. Get in there, Ray! So, have you chosen a name for your baby? Ruth. Well, you told me Uncle Ray and Aunt Livy were having a baby. Aren't you? I hav... I haven't thought of a name yet. I like the name Patricia. My parents had to go and name me Ruth. Ruth is an old biblical name. It's a very beautiful one, in my opinion. Thank you. Maybe now she'll keep it. Boys, get on! Get on! Move it on out of here, boys! Uncle Ray's at the wheel. Martha, did you grow up in this house? I did. Our grandpa built it. And before that, he and Grandma lived in a dugout, which is still over there by the south field. Right? Really? So, you never lived anywhere else? Nope. Our younger brother, Danny... was the adventurous one. Drop it now! What?! What's in your locket? Oh, I forgot I was wearing it. Ruth, don't pry. It's as if your mother didn't teach you any manners. Easy, easy! It looks a little heavy, Ray! Drop her down! Lever on the left! On the left! Isn't there a manual for that thing? Well, if there were, do you think they'd read it? That was easy! I didn't ask him to do that... to dig a swimming hole. I don't know why he's going to the trouble. He just wants to please you. I may not dance. Well, Martha'll just be glad we're there. She's always been a fool for dancing. Slim's her favorite. Don't you ever wonder what else is out there, beyond the farm? Sometimes. Aren't you curious how other people live? I enjoy a drive, but... I like coming back to my place. Sleeping on my land. Your land. It seems every war in human history is about owning the land. I like the Indian view... that we're just temporary guardians of the land where we live. It's not temporary to me. But your family's owned this land for less than a hundred years. In the span of history, that's nothing. In the span of a life... that's near everything. You're next, you know! And you think I'm joking. They're here... Uncle Ray and Aunt Livy. Oh! Ah, there they are. Happy birthday. Hey, Ray. Hey! Happy birthday, sis. Oh, finally. It's not a party till you come. Come on, come on. There's my guy. Ray, you really ought to dance. I'm fine. All right. You sure? Yeah. All right. How about a dance with my beautiful daughter? Aw... Hank Jr? Come here. Come here. Good. Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Right here. It was good. We're here tonight to celebrate a birthday. I've known this fine, young lady since... since I was Slim. Martha, Hank says you're a fine wife. That's the truth, Slim. The best. We know you're a fine mother, You bet. And you're a first-class friend. Happy Birthday. - Thank you. - Happy Birthday! Thank you, sweetheart. That's my girl.

Hi. One... Hi. I brought drinks. Thank you. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Let's sit. We skipped off from our overseer. Florie... Although we shouldn't tell you that. This is your land. My husband's. He's handsome. Who? Your husband. Oh. So, um, where were you... before the war? California. Mm-hmm. Born and raised. We were both at USC. What were your majors? Mine was English. English. I hoped to teach literature someday. Rose is a long-term planner. Everything in her life she plans ten years in advance. You didn't plan on this, did you, Rose? Picking potatoes? At least I had plans. I hadn't declared my major yet. Too many things interested me. Mm-hmm. Too many boys. I was in graduate school in Denver, studying archeology. Someday, I wanted to go to Turkey to see the lost cities of Ephesus and Troy. Really? Why did you leave your studies? My mother got sick, and Abby... uh, my sister, was already married, so I left school to be with her until she died. I'm sorry. And then, before I knew it, I was... swept off my feet, and now I'm here. That's so romantic. When are you expecting? Florie. I'm sorry. No, I didn't realize it showed. Forgive us for prying... Do you need maternity clothes? I hadn't really thought about it yet. Well, our father's a tailor. We all sew in the family. Choose the fabric, and we'll make you something. Uh-huh. Thank you. Thank you so mu... thank you. You're welcome. It's our pleasure. - Thank you. - Bye. Ooh, the wind's turned. Coming out of the north. I made friends with two girls from the work crew today. They study butterflies, and I was thinking I could take them for a drive in the mountains sometime. Japanese? Well, they're American. Those Americans who look Japanese. You blame them for Pearl Harbor, for Daniel? I'm not as stupid as you think. I know they're not the same people who bombed Pearl Harbor. They kept our crops going the past couple of years. I never said you were stupid. And I never said I disliked them. I just said they were Japanese, that's all. And you keep your distance. Look, I got a lot to do around here. I got to keep this place going pretty much on my own. I don't go into the fields to... to socialize. Rose and Florie both went to USC. Can't tell you how good it is to talk about something other than crops and the weather. I bet. Thank you, Lord, for your gifts, and may we be ever mindful of your love. - Amen. - Amen. Pass the taters. Put your napkin on your lap first. Would you care for a roll, Livy? Thanks. Ray? I'm considering beans in the north field. - Are you? - Mm. Price of beans can't go anywhere but up. Yeah. Well, what do you think? I've been thinking about... about Troy. Troy who? City of. The lost one over there in Turkey. Turkey? Uh, Homer wrote about it in the Iliad. No one knew if there really had been such a city, or if Troy was merely a myth until an archeologist found it. How do you lose a city? Under the sand. They, uh... they had to excavate it. Well, I'll be. We could've... we could've dug it up, Ray, with the Claw. So, Ray, are you going to plant some beans this year? If you think we ought to. Good night. Good night. Abby? Abby?! Abby! Oh... Whoo! Oh... Hello, hello. Franklin, it's okay, shh. Is everything all right? Uh, no. What? What's happened? Is it father? No, he's fine. It's Kent. They shipped him out. He left last week. Oh, hon, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. It's worse than I ever imagined. You're out in the middle of nowhere. There are more people around than you'd think. We haven't heard from you in almost a month. I know. I've just been... getting adjusted, I guess. Liv, that skirt is too small for you. Uh... Come inside, come inside. I want you to move back to Denver and stay with me. Abby, how could I do that? How could you not? You're not having your baby on a beet farm. I need your help. With Kent overseas for who knows how long, I'll go mad in that house alone. You've no idea how lonely it is. I used to feel that way... when I was caring for mother. I would just sit there waiting for those minutes a day she was awake. It wasn't fair for Daddy to drop the entire burden of caring for mother on you. I had my hands full with Kent. But we'd have such a good time now, Liv, just the two of us... until Kent got home. Ray. Look who's here. This is my sister, Abby. Uh, nice to meet you. Hello. Welcome. What? Rain. All anyone talks about is the weather. Livy, when are you coming home? What about the baby? I'll baby-sit. You can go back to school. Why not? Father's satisfied. You're married. There'll be no baby born out of wedlock. There's more than one way to work the rumor mill, Livy. A few well-chosen words among the gossips at church... What do you mean? The Denver ladies will be tripping over themselves to offer you sympathy. Who knew he drank or had that temper? Can you image raising a child in a home like that? No, that's not Ray. So? Ray? No. Ray's the most gentle man I've ever met. This has nothing to do with him. It's about doing what's best for you. Any word from Edward? Mm, no. Livy, you had so many plans. No one deserves to stay married to someone they don't love, especially not you. Give my love to father. I will. Does he ever ask about me? Yes, often. You're a terrible liar. Will you mail this letter for me? Sure, hon. Bye. Love you. Mm-mm. ♪ Cheeks of rose ♪ ♪ Tiny toes ♪ ♪ Has our little baby ♪ ♪ Eyes of blue ♪ ♪ Fingers, too ♪ ♪ Cunning all as may be... ♪ Hi. Hi. You were singing. What was it? It's just a song Daddy'd sing to us kids. I was trying to remember it so I could sing it to the baby. My sister wants me to go back to Denver to deliver... in the hospital. Where is she? She left already. I'll make some lunch. Swallowtail. Probably a Western Tiger. Those spots. The spots on the wings are beautiful. False eyes. Oh, Florie, did you get it? Got it. False eyes confuse its enemy. Moths have them, too. How can you tell a moth from a butterfly? Moths rest with their wings spread. Butterflies, with their wings together. And more often, moths have protective coloring so they blend in. Butterflies are bold. Just look at some of the species we've found. See? Colors. Mm. What is this? That was strictly for our observations, Florie. Stop fussing. Perfect. Florie... Look! Look! Wow, this is nice. After your second baby. What's your husband's favorite color? I don't know. What's yours? Blue and red. Like the false eyes on a swallowtail. Yes, exactly. How's this? Ooh, I love that. Oh, good. Father makes the finest suits, Livy. Uh... it would be wonderful if you could come meet our parents... Would you please not handle the fabric? I'm going to buy this. Are you with these people? Yes, I am. Well, if they could get on with their business, management would appreciate it. What else do we need here? ♪ They asked me how I knew ♪ ♪ My true love was true ♪ ♪ I, of course, replied ♪ ♪ Something here inside ♪ ♪ Cannot be denied. ♪ Germans. Those are German POWs. ♪ ♪ We'll do a fitting soon. Yes. Bye, Livy. Bye. Thank you, Livy. See you. Oh, my! Oh. I was getting worried. Sorry I'm late. I found the dugout... the dugout that Martha was talking about. Look, arrowheads. Livy, I don't mean to disappoint you, but my granddaddy owned a gun. For sure, he didn't use a bow and arrow. No, I know that, but he or your grandmother were interested enough to collect them. Look. A whole jar of flints. Someone in your family was a budding archeologist. Look at this one. I so wish father could have done this himself. He's the expert, but he hasn't been well since the move. They took his work and... and our house. Still, he says, we must prove our loyalty. We must show them we are good Americans. He buys war bonds. Florie. Mother's no better, Livy. She made us clean the house... Stop. We had to sell our house for half its worth, yet my mother insisted we clean it for the new owners. We even waxed the floors. I still don't understand why you're so angry about that. Of course we wanted to present a clean house. It was stolen from us, Rose. You know why there are so few young men at Camp Amache? Why? They were drafted. The 442nd Regiment fighting in France. Enough! And Rose is like our parents. Always proper, always good. Thank you, Livy. Thank you so much. Thank you. You're welcome. Livy... I've met someone. Florence! We met on one of the farms... He was guarding the German POWs working there. He gave me this. Oh... It belonged to his mother. You must be very special to him. He tells me I am. Florie, we have to get back. Rose is just jealous. Um, but I want you to meet him. Will you? Of course I will. Good. Thank you. What's his name? Walter. Bye, Livy. Bye. Bye, Rose. Bye, Livy. Thank you. Bye. Why on earth did you bring him up? No! No! What? What-what's wrong? My artifacts from the dugout. What are you doing?! I was just cleaning out the shed. Where is the burlap bag? What did you do with it! Livy. It was near the bottom of the pile. It hadn't caught fire. Livy, this is a working farm. If something doesn't have a use, I throw it out. I thought it was trash. It's not trash. It's history. It's your history. I'd do anything... I'd do anything to make you happy. I know. I know that. Dear Livy, if you like junk, you'll like the cellar. Be careful. It's dusty down there. Higher, there... Wait, um... I'm not sure why we're putting an old ox yoke inside the house. It was probably that very yoke your grandfather used to first break this land. Yeah, well, it's about to break my back. I want to show you the family history that means the most to me. I let him talk me into a deal. If I'd stay behind and work the farm, he'd join the navy. Landlocked his whole growing up, he was always dreaming of the ocean. I was the oldest. I should have gone. Remember, your phone is ring-ring-ring. Come on, Daddy, let's get to Wilson! All right, Let's go. If you hear only ring, that's Miss Paulson. Ring-ring is the McGregors. Ring-ring-ring, that's your signal. Ring-ring-ring. Hello. We're talking on the telephone! Hey, everybody it's Hank here! It works! Hi, Aunt Livy! You want to come in? All right. Come on! Come on! It's getting cold out here. Come on, Franklin. Hi. We don't have animals in this house. Get out! Get out! Get out now! Get out! Get out! It's just for tonight. It's terribly cold out there. I grew up here. I ate at this table. For all my growing up, my mama never let a dog in the house, and I won't either. He'll freeze. This came for you today. To Livy Dunne. I'm guessing he didn't know you were married, huh? I'm taking the night shift at the beet factory. It's something I sometimes do this time of year. Don't bother waiting up. I didn't know what you had for breakfast, because I've never been up that early. But I made you some eggs and some oatmeal. There's no need. Just plain eggs. There's no onions or peppers. Ray, wait. I'm sorry that I let Franklin in the house. I did not realize what an insult that would be to you. With all the other animals in that barn, that dog'll be fine. I have something I want to tell you. My first day here, I looked in your dresser. I can't even explain why I did it. I'm sorry. You could've looked in there anytime you wanted. I got nothing to hide from you. There was a watch. I could hear it ticking. I've never seen you carry it. It was my father's. Sometimes I wind it up when I want to remember him. I remembered how good he was to my mama. Kind of husband I want to be. First day I... wound it up for no good reason. Just for luck. Ray, I made a mistake. Which mistake would that be, huh? Being with him or marrying me? Would it be easier if I left? Is there anything you like about me, Livy? Hi, Chester. Mama, it's Aunt Livy! Hi. Hi. Oh, Ruth was just talking about you. And here you are. It's like you read my mind. See, we don't need a telephone. Yes, we do. I was thinking of you, too, Ruth. I was wondering if you wanted to have this dress. As big as I am now, I can't imagine ever fitting into it again. The hat comes with it. Can I try it? Go on. Did Ray tell you... I don't know the details. He and Hank had to go over to the beet factory. Why don't you come in and sit down? For months I've... I've written the father of this baby. I thought he died. I didn't realize... No. He... he's a flight instructor. He never went overseas. We met on furlough. And for months, I've... written him these letters. I know it was wrong. For the longest time, I didn't hear from him, and as long as I didn't hear from him, I could imagine that he wanted me. I finally got a letter. "Congratulations, Livy. "You're a wonderful girl. "And I only hope you find the father of this baby, because I sincerely doubt that I'm responsible." I know that I've hurt Ray. My sister wants me to go back to Denver to have the baby. Might be best if I leave after Thanksgiving. When Ray loves a person, it's with his whole heart. Losing our baby brother to the war nearly killed him. If you're planning on leaving, do it soon. You know, there's one thing I've never heard you say. And that's how you feel about Ray. Mama? Livy? Livy. It's all right. What happened? Calling out. Calling out for your mama. After Mama died, I was so lonely. I gave my life away, just to be held. By a stranger. How could I do that? Ray... you are such a good... Thank you. Thank you. Happy Thanksgiving. Oh, it was so kind of you to bake us a pie, Livy. Happy Thanksgiving. Livy tells me you're from California. Yes, we are. I've never been to California. Livy, can we talk? I've never been to Colorado. Um, do you think you can meet my boyfriend two weeks from Saturday? Perhaps, uh, we could go for a drive just to get away from here for the afternoon. All right. What time? How's noon? I'll pick you up here. Oh, no. Um, not here, Livy. Uh, on the road, by the grain elevators. All right. Thank you, Livy. I'm grateful for all of you, of course, but I'd also like to pray that this war will soon be over. And I'm thankful for the harvest this year. God's been good to us. I'm thankful that the baby's coming and I'm going to have a cousin. I'm grateful that Daniel's seat beside me isn't empty. I've... I've learned more about love... in my six months with this family than I did in the 25 years in my father's house. I have... I have received love here. And I have received forbearance. And I thank you. I will always remember you. Everyone of you. Happy Thanksgiving. Amen. Let's dig in. Ray.. I, uh, have to go say good-bye to the girls. Oh, that's all right. He can stay if he wants. It's awful cold. When you come out here, I know you saw this as an agreement between your daddy and Reverend Case. Marrying wasn't your idea. I know you may have your mind set on leaving, but... I can't let you go without telling you how I feel. I've fallen in love with you. And I love that baby. For me, you're the best thing that's ever happened. Livy, you're a fine and talented woman. You're a pitiful cook, but that doesn't matter. I can do the cookin'. I know you had your heart set on going to faraway places, but there's a good bit of history right here in Otero County. If you like Indian canyons and dugouts, I'll help you find them. You can dig around all you want. Sound like I'm trying to sell you something. That day, when the preacher married us, I forgot the ring. I have one now. Ray, the truth is, I don't know if I deserve you. How do you know this could work? I know, because... someday you're gonna forgive yourself. Hi. I'm so sorry I'm late. Hi. I knew you wouldn't let us down. Um, Livy, this is Walter. Hello. So nice to meet you. Um, where-where do you... Oh, uh, we thought we'd go south where we saw the Swallowtails. That's almost to New Mexico. Walter's on leave and he's got a cousin down that way. I thought we could drop him off. You'll freeze. It's fine. Walter's from Idaho. He's tough. Um... Well, uh, let's get going. We have a long drive. Are you insane? What are you talking about? What did he promise you? I don't know what you're talking about... Florie. I've seen him on the work crew. Did you make his uniform? If you'd rather not take me and Walter for a drive, you should just let us out here, Livy. Florie, stop it! You stop it. You're just jealous because he loves me. If he loves you, why would he leave? As soon as this war is over, he'll be free. If anyone finds out you helped this man, you and Rose will be accused of treason. You could go to prison for the rest of your lives. Florie, that uniform ties him not only to you but to your family. To your father and your mother. Father and mother have nothing to do with it. Nor does Rose. Listen to me... you're going to go home, you're going to burn every scrap of fabric left from that uniform. You're going to take that bracelet, you're going to throw it into a field. Walk away, Florie, and never look back. You're lonely, and you're reaching out for something to make it better. But you can't do this. You'll be paying for it the rest of your life. Florie? Get out of the truck... both of you. Tell him that it's safer if you don't travel with him. It'll be safer if you travel alone. It's okay. Get down. Come here. Come here. Come here. Sit. Stay. Stay. Walter, let me be frank with you. You'll never make it across the border dressed as an MP. Nein. Come with me. This way. My husband's room is right up these stairs. Open the wardrobe and put on some clothes. Leave the clothes that you're wearing on the floor. My husband will be home any minute. Hurry. Come on, Franklin. Listen... Florie loves you. Soon this war will be over and you'll be free. If you leave now, how will you find her? Do you have something to drink? Bitte? Yes. I can make some coffee. Come on, Franklin. Wilson operator. Operator, could you please connect me to the sheriff's department? One moment, please. Sheriff's Haynes. Can I help you? Sheriff, this is Livy Singleton, Ray Singleton's wife. Yes, ma'am. I want you to know that an escaped POW has just stolen my truck and is now headed down Route 22. He should be running out of gas about the time he hits the bridge. He's unarmed, so please don't hurt him. Thank you, Mrs. Singleton. We'll put someone on it right away. And officer, I'm in labor. I need some help. Oh, oh. Livy? What in the world are you doing? Getting ready for our baby. Our baby's coming! Our baby... I'll send Martha right over! Hurry! Thank you, Doctor. Hey there. ♪ Cheeks of rose ♪ ♪ Tiny toes ♪ ♪ Has our little baby ♪ ♪ Eyes of blue ♪ ♪ Fingers, too ♪ ♪ Gotta love this baby. ♪ Aw! Thank you so much. This is for you. What? Butterflies of America. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. That's right, Danny. This was your granddaddy's watch. And someday it's going to be yours, but in the meantime, I'll just hold on to it for you. We got to get going. Your mama's set on a treasure hunt. It's not a treasure hunt. It's his first archeological dig. For arrowheads, right? Ready? Come on, let's go. Let's go. We're going to fly there.
