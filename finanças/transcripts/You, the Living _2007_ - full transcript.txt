Be pleased then, you, the living, in your delightfully warmed bed, before Lethe's ice-cold wave will lick your escaping foot. l had a nightmare. l dreamt that bombers were coming. Could you leave? Get lost! Scram! What about Bobbo? lt's your dog. Both of you. Leave, both of you! Now, that's not very nice of you. No one understands me. What the hell are you talking about? No one bloody understands me! No one likes me either. No one! Jesus Christ! You know perfectly well that l like you. lt's not true. lt's all a big goddamn lie. No one likes me! - l like you. - No one! Bobbo likes you, and he doesn't lie, does he? He bloody well does too. Get out of here! Both of you! Come, Bobbo. Maybe things would be better if l didn't exist. So you wouldn't have to feel guilty. Now that really hurts my feelings. Do you think l want you to die? That won't make things better. You have to do your best in life. Or at least try. And after all, there's lots of fun things, right? - We had a good time yesterday. - Sure, yesterday. No... lf only l had a motorcycle. Then l'd take off, get away from all this shit. - Right away. - Yeah, yeah. By the way, the oven is on. - What's in it? - A roast. - What kind of roast? - Veal. Piss off! Both of you! l might be over in a while. A motorcycle is my dream l'd be so happy that l'd scream A lovely thing with blazing speed To leave this place is what l need lt takes a pile of dough And a licence, you know But l'm all out And that l'm pretty pissed and mad about Hardly ever dreams come true Same thing goes for my dreams, too Here l sit in a park and stare The whole world waits for me out there l'm a miserable wench On an ugIy bench - ls it strange to pray? - No, it's OK For a bike to take me far away Nobody understands me. YOU, THE LlVlNG Olle. What are you doing? l'm standing here. Well, l can see that, but what are you doing? l'm standing here. That's what l'm doing. - You're thinking too, aren't you? - Of course l am. So what are you thinking about? Well, now that you ask, l've forgotten. Did you think about me at all? Maybe l wasn't. You never do. Now you're exaggerating. Aren't you coming to bed? Tomorrow is another day. What did you say? Aren't you coming to bed? Yeah, l guess so. Tomorrow is another day. - What did you say? - Tomorrow is another day. Didn't you hear what l said? Get lost! Get out of here, both of you. - You're not being very nice. - Well, maybe l'm not. Get lost! OK, everyone! Last orders now! Last orders! Tomorrow is another day. Last chance to get really drunk. l might be along in a while! - Hello. - Hi. There's something l just have to say. OK. l think you play so very well. Thanks. That's nice to hear. That's all l wanted to say. OK. A beer maybe? Thanks. l don't drink beer. lt makes me sleepy. OK. How about a drink? Yes. - What kind? - Caipirinha. Would your friend like one too? Don't know, l'll ask. - She does. - Nobody understands me. - Johan! - Nobody understands me... Not a bloody soul. - Good morning, everyone. - Good morning, ma'am. What's wrong, ma'am? My husband called me a hag. What's that? Why don't you ask him? We don't seem to have green in that length. We should have a red one over here. Shall we look at it? Yes. ls it really 1 0 feet? lt should be, yes. No, in fact, it wasn't. - Jörgen! - Yes! Have you sold any of that red runner today? Yes. A few feet went this morning. - Then you have to change the label. - Right. A lot of things are going wrong today. lt's just not my day. l've had a fight with my wife. lt happens. The thing is, l happened to call her a hag. - That wasn't very nice. - But she called me an old fart. - Sorry? - Old fart! l think hag is worse. Don't you think so, Gustav? The devil knows. Let's go. Did you call for me? - What? - Was it you who called for me? Called? Nope. - Jonas, did you call for Holger? - What did you say? - Did you call for Holger? - No. - What about Lasse? - Lasse! - Did you call for Holger? - No, why? - Nope. - Nope. l had a dream last night. lt was not a pleasant dream, mind you. l dreamt l was at a family dinner party. A bloody big dinner party. l couldn't understand why l was there. l wasn't related to anyone. l didn't know anyone either. lt was a dreary gathering. Bloody hell, it was depressing. l didn't understand why, but l got the feeling it was my fault. l felt it was up to me to lighten up the atmosphere, do something funny. l thought, "l'll do the tablecloth trick", even though l'd never done it before. There was a hell of a lot of china that came off the table with the cloth. Good God. The police came, and there was a trial. l was charged with gross negligence, disregarding someone else's property. The worst thing you could do, they said. lt's 200 years old. More than 200 years old. Don't worry about it. Perhaps we should eat first? That shouldn't be necessary. What's all this bloody commotion? Counsellor Akerblom. l would like to inform you that no tears in the world can affect the verdict of this court. ls that understood? - Do you understand? - Yes. Continue. Right, Your Honour. This is a matter of particularly gross negligence and destruction of property. Particularly gross negligence. The set, it was handed down from my great-great-grandmother. And it was more than 200 years old. How old did you say it was? More than 200 years. Life sentence, in my view. That's not enough. - The electric chair perhaps. - Precisely. - The electric chair? - Yes! The electric chair, going once, twice, three times. The electric chair. That's life. What the hell was that? Try to relax, Benny. Benny, try to relax. lt was from my great-great-grandmother. And it was 200 years old. More than 200 years old. Over 200 years old. Come, let's go. Try to relax, Benny. Try to think about something else. The electric chair. What a terrible invention. How could you come up with such a thing? lt's terrible. There. Mum! - Mum! - What? - Mum! - Yes. Tell us what life was like when you were a child. How things were. Maybe there's something special you remember that you can tell us. What? Can you tell us about your childhood? How things were when you were little. Life was hard. lt was difficult. You didn't have any money. Once you had to walk from Karlstad to Oslo. Can you tell us about that, Mum? Once you had to walk from Karlstad to Oslo. Can you tell us about that, Mum? And your brother, Benjamin, who died when he was young. You liked him so very much. Your little brother, Benjamin. Who's that? Mum... Just try to tell us something of what it was like. That it wasn't always easy. Mum... Just a little. Try, Mum. Just a little. A little. lt's already half-past five! What can l say? "Oh really?" Telephone for Professor Holmberg. lt's his son. lt's important. There is a phone call for you. lt's important. lt's your son. Hello! Hello, Johan. But dear God, Johan. You got money last week. Yes, you did. And l heard you asked your mother for money as well. And not for the first time, either. Are you not ashamed, Johan? You should be. You should be ashamed. And Eva told Mother that you borrowed money from her too. Several times. And from Uncle Arvid too. That's the last they heard from you. Can't you see you're embarrassing me? Yes, you do. You embarrass me and your mother and your sister. Yes, you do. Yes, l'm disappointed. Upset and unhappy. Well, what do you think? l don't want to think the worst. l'm really beginning to do that, Johan. Yes, l am, and Mother is too. Oh dear. How much is it, then? l'll help you out this time too, Johan, but then this has to stop. l won't stand for it. Yes. Now? No. l don't have that kind of money on me. No, no, l can't. l can't leave. lt's impossible. Yes, absolutely impossible. Yes, l'm going to give a speech. Yes, l've promised. lf l don't, they'll be very disappointed. Yes, very disappointed. Yes, yes. Johan, calm down now. lt's a jubilee. Hello? Hi. - ls Micke here? - Micke who? Micke Larsson. No. - He is the singer in Black Devils. - What? Black Devils. There's a band that comes after us at 4:00. - What's your name then? - We're called Louisiana Brass Band. You were going to call, Micke. You said you were going to call. You're such a good singer, Micke. So damn good! Holy shit. Things are happening here. Hang on. Tobbe, did you hear that? l guess you'll have to cancel golf today. What am l doing? We're sitting here celebrating. Conny Blom and me. Fantastic lunch. And the gods are congratulating us with thunderous applause! Very, very good, Tobbe. That's why l'm giving you a buzz. Listen, that boat, is it gone? l didn't think so. Not many people can put up that kind of cash these days. But l can, Tobbe. What would your price be if l said with no receipt? l know, l know. Quality doesn't come cheap. "No money, no tournedos" as the ancient Greeks used to say. What, Bordeaux? And no Bordeaux either. No money, no tournedos and no Bordeaux either. That's brilliant, Tobbe. You're a goddamn poet. Conny agrees. Waiter! Can l pay, please? l am a man who enjoys quality. You know that, Tobbe. l'm bloody grateful for that. Not everyone can afford it. lt's too bad. Quality is not for the common man. Never has been, never will be. That's just the way it is. We did some really decent business today. Really. How did that philosopher put it? You can't play nice in war and business. Or something like that. What? We're just going to finish our brandy. Then we'll have drinks at the Savoy. So, you're bloody welcome. You'll get a fat down payment in cash. What the hell? Hang on, Tobbe. Wait. Could we perhaps take some measurements? Could we take the coat? And perhaps the jacket, too? Excuse me, my jacket! Shoulder blades, 1 9. Elbows, 25. Waist measurement, 43. Arm length, 52. Jacket length, 68. And then we have this as well. A little prickly. Shoulder, 1 7. Knee height, 39. Leg length, 87. This is what you get for your sins, you homeless bastards. We're taking last orders now. Last orders. Tomorrow is another day. l have a question, Doctor. Lars Johansson! Take it easy. We'll call for you. - Good morning. - Good morning. Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. l am a psychiatrist. l have been for 27 years. l'm completely worn out. Year after year, listening to patients who aren't satisfied with their lives, who want to have fun, who want me to help them with that. lt wears you out, l can tell you. My life isn't exactly a lot of fun either. People demand so much. That's the conclusion l've drawn after all these years. They demand to be happy, at the same time as they are egocentric, selfish, and ungenerous. Well, l would like to be honest. l would like to say that they are quite simply mean, most of them. Spending hour after hour in therapy, trying to make a mean person happy. There's no point. You can't do it. l've stopped doing it. These days, l just prescribe pills. The stronger, the better. That's the way it is. Hi. Nobody understands me. - Nobody understands me. - l understand. - Do you live here? - No. Could you move? l have to put some letters in the box. Always a pleasure to be here, Karin. Thank you, that's nice to hear. Damn, that smells good. Thanks. What a mother you have, Uffe. lt's a shame she's a sadist, though. Oh my! What are you saying, Mia? - A sadist! - Take it easy! That's someone who likes to torment people. - And that's what l do, you mean? - Well... How should l put it? Serving non-alcoholic beer with food that smells so good. lt's torture. l only want what's best for you. Best! ls this what's best for me, enduring this damned existence with all the shit and deceit and wickedness and staying sober? How can you expect or even want a single poor bugger to put up with it without being drunk? lt's inhuman. lt's torture. - Only a sadist would demand that. - Hey, take it easy. Take it easy. You're kind, Karin. l'm not angry with you. You know that. lt's always nice to be here. When are you getting married? Get married? What good would that do? That wouldn't help anything. Dinner will be ready soon. That'll be great. That feels good. l got a letter from the bank today. lt was not a nice letter, mind you. So nice. l've been saving up for my retirement. For more than 1 6 years. They advised me to put my savings in funds. So l did. All my earnings from playing at funerals and in the military band were invested in two different funds. The bank thought it was a good idea. lf one fund did poorly, the other could do well, they said. l found out today, neither of them did well. Quite the opposite. My retirement savings have gone down by 34%, l was told. Quite disheartening news, l tell you. So nice! The bank agreed. They said it was unfortunate. They said l'd had bad luck. Things like this happen, they said. You simply have bad luck sometimes. l've played 39 times in the military band so far this year and played at 48 funerals. All the money went to my retirement funds. l have been able to live off other gigs. And now l find out that my pension is going to be a lot smaller. All the money has just gone down the drain. lt's a tragedy indeed. And this is what is going to happen. l've worked it out... l'm eventually going to have to sell my car. lt's really quite depressing. - lt's a nice day today. - What? - l said, it's a nice day today. - lt might be. - Sorry? - l said, "lt might be." And how would we like our hair cut? The same, somewhat shorter, nothing different. Just tidy it up a bit. l'm in a hurry. l have to go to a meeting. l see. Do you want a part? The way it is, l said. Do l have a part now? Not exactly, but your hair does fall somewhat towards the left. To the left? - Yes. - lt falls to the right, damn it. - Not when you look at it from here. - l'm the one getting a haircut. Maybe it's hard, when you are used to reading and writing backwards. - Backwards? - Yes. From right to left, the way you do down there in the desert. Arabic is written from the right, but it doesn't mean we write backwards, damn it! lf a car drives across a street from the right, that doesn't mean it's driving backwards, does it? Will you just shut up and cut? Sorry about the part, but sometimes something new can cheer you up. lf that's what l wanted, l'd have asked for that. Do l look tired or something? What the hell do you mean? - No, not exactly. - ln that case, get going and cut. Bend your head forwards a bit. What the hell? That's him. He's the one who did it. He's the one who did it. Do you realise what you've done? l have a bloody important meeting. You've ruined everything, you stupid idiot. l'm going to sue you. l'll get the shirt off your back. Hundreds of thousands. Get it? Take it easy, damn it, take it easy. Take it easy? What do you mean? Well, l was in a bad mood. l know, it happens sometimes, and l had a fight with my wife, too. What kind of a bloody excuse is that? You goddamn... Bastard! Take it easy, damn it. l'll fix it for free. Fix it? You have ruined a bloody important meeting for me. lt'll cost you the shirt off your back. Get it? l'll make sure of that. You bloody... Take it easy. l'll fix it for free. Hello, Jan Molin. Jan Molin. Hello, Jan Molin. - Hello, Jan Molin. - Kristina. - Hello, Jan Molin. - Hello, Sten Welander. Hello. - Jan! - Hello, Göran. Haven't seen you in ages! - Must be eight or nine years. - Yes. Last time l was at Atlas Copco. You had more hair in those days. - Jesus, time flies. - lt really does. - Your boys, they must be... - No. More like this, l think. Hi. Right. Not everyone is here yet, but we might as well sit down. Good to see you. Excuse me for being late. Hello. Lars Melander. Head of Production. Anders Lundell, Director of Finance. We can shake hands later. Well, my friends. We are gathered here today to discuss a problem that we in fact share with many other companies. Both here and abroad. Which doesn't make things easier. ln short, things are going well for the company. Profits are decent, but the value of our shares is too low. That is the view of many of our owners as well as the board. So, apart from the management, we have asked you here today. Jan Molin, l've known for years. Together with Sven and the others in management, l have looked through your offer and suggestions very carefully. - l think it looks good. - Thank you, that's nice to hear. Tobias Ek, Sten Welander and Jan-Olof Abrahamsson have also submitted proposals for improvement deserving consideration. lf l may speak plainly, the board has expressed its serious displeasure with the current situation. l can't lift my arm. l can't... Göran, Göran! He's breathing. Göran, are you all right? This looks serious. Get an ambulance. Call an ambulance. l have heard of a heavenly city Above earthly and mist-covered lands Of the sun-blessed beaches and sands And one day, oh one day, l'll be there! Hallelujah, l must sing aloud! Hallelujah! l go to that city lf my footsteps grow tired and weary l stride upwards and home all the same Thank you, my best friend. l have heard of a land without tears Without grief, without want, without strife Where sickness and pain are not rife And one day, oh one day, l'll be there! Farewell, Göran. Thank you... Thank you for everything. Really. Daddy! Lord, please Lord, forgive them. Forgive them... Forgive those who are greedy and cheap. Forgive those who are greedy and miserly. And those who deceive and cheat or grow rich by paying miserable wages. Dear lord, forgive them. Forgive them. And Lord, forgive those who humiliate and desecrate. Forgive those who torture and kill. Forgive those who bomb and destroy cities and villages. Forgive those who are dishonest, those who lie and are false. Forgive governments who withhold the truth from the people. Dear Lord, forgive them. Forgive those who are heartless, merciless, and quick to pass judgement. Please Lord, forgive them. Forgive courts that pass sentences too harsh or convict the innocent. - Forgive them. - Anna... We have to close and lock up now. Forgive newspapers and TV channels that mislead. That distract attention from that which is important. Dear Lord, forgive them. There now, Anna. We have to close and lock up now. Dear Lord, forgive them. Forgive them. l had a dream last night. l dreamt l married... Micke Larsson. He plays guitar and sings in Black Devils. lt was so nice. So nice... Wonderful. Fantastic. You play so very well, Micke. - Hello! - Hello! Congratulations! Where's Anna? She's here. Hello, Anna! - Who are you? - We have come to congratulate you. You look nice. Cheers to the happy couple! lt looks really cosy in there. - Where are you off to? - We haven't decided yet. We'll see. - Anna and Micke, best of luck. - Anna and Micke, best of luck! Micke, play. Play, Micke. Everyone was so kind. Even though l didn't know them. l didn't know a single one. But they were kind all the same. So nice... They wanted things to be good for us, me and Micke. lt was so nice. So very nice. Listen up! We'll take last orders now. Last orders! The day before yesterday l dreamt l could fly. l laid myself turned to the wind, like this. And l flew high, high up. Up there l waved down to Mum and Dad. They waved back. They were so happy. And so was l. lt was lovely. Oh dear. - What? - "Oh dear", l said. Yes, yes. l have heard of a heavenly city Above earthly and mist-covered lands And one day, oh one day, l'll be there! l have heard of a land without tears Without grief, without want, without strife Where sickness and pain are not rife And one day, oh one day, l'll be there! You play so well, Micke. So very well. And you're a fantastic singer. So good. So very good. l love you so much, Micke. So much. So very much. Anna. Anna! Can you come and taste the gravy?
