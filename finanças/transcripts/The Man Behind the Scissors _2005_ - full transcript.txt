Welcome. Noodles. Did you read the magazine? What happened? "The Mystery of the Second Scissors" So he beat us to it. It's got to be Hidaka. He told the press, I know it. Let's skip the legwork and catch Hidaka. We have a witness, too. Sorry. We really have a witness? At a burger shop. My noodles? So, Hidaka was seen? Yeah. I'II inform the Superintendent. Hey, wait! Isobe! So there was a witness? Yes. Hidaka's our man? A worker at the burger shop saw him. That's great. I'II inform the Chief. We'II need more people. Why the rush? Why? We should wait and see for a few more days. It could be a mistake. You're right. I'm going too fast. I guess, I'm way out of my league. Anyway, please keep up the good work. This address should be fine. Hey, Shindo. Shindo. Let' s go. Okay... Failed again? It' s your fault. You' re the one who' s making me suffer. The horrible things that you do... Me? Kill me. Take me out of my misery. You know I can't kill you. Why? Why won't you kill me like everybody else? Because I'm here for you. That' s a lie! All you do is talk. You don't care about me. You care about yourself... and those smart and pretty girls you' ve killed! You' re on your own for all I care. I'm gone. Why did she seem so happy? You didn't have feelings. You slept with many men. Your had eyes like glass. So what made you smile like that? You' II catch a cold. We should talk. Shouldrt we? Buzz off, freak. Let' s talk. We' re so much alike. What? The Scissor Man has connected us together. No, he hasn't. We both sa w the same body. A victim of the Scissor Man. We were destined to. Don't you see that we' re bound to each other now? The Scissor Man didn't do it. That wasn't him. You' re lying! Who else could make such a perfect body? It' s not him. You' re lying. Liar. Liar... We better stop him. We can't. Hidaka will know that we followed him. But she' s in danger! Isobe... "Koichi Hidaka" Let her go! Get a way from her! Or I'II nail you for attempted assault. Are you alright? You' re muddy. Don't bother. But you' re wet. Come with me. No. I'm going home. You' re still here. There' s nowhere else to go. You' re bleeding. I fell. Sit here. That should do it. Are you glad I'm back? Very much. I thought you liked being alone. That' s what you think. I don't get you. That' s okay because I understand you. Liar. "Meguro West Police Station" I hope you know what you' ve done. I'm sorry, sir. Hidaka is sure to act cautiously from now on. I apologize. What' s done is done. Stay home and behave yourself. There' s no need for you to attend the meeting today. Sir. Feeling sorry for yourself? Isobe. Talk to me. You told me off. No, Hidaka came to the police and claimed that... a cop was stalking him. I'm gonna get that son of a bitch. Here. What is it? Information on the girl, Chika Yasunaga. I got it for you. But she' s got nothing to do with the killings. She still found the body. She' s had one hell of a childhood. Really? Her father was deep in debt and took his life when she was a teenager. What is it? Who do you think found the body? She did. He jumped off a building, so you can imagine how dreadful it must' ve been. She left home and is living alone ever since. That' s shocking. She' s seen her father' s body. Let' s get back to work. There' s something on my mind. What? Take a look. What the... Footprints? You were comparing those found at 3 scenes. That' s right. The sneakers are different, but they' re worn by the same person. What do you mean? Look at the way the soles wear out. There' s pressure on the big toe and the heel. You' re right. They' re identical. But forensics couldn't have overlooked these prints. They were small. Size 6.5. A womar s. What? Even forensics were fooled by the name, "Scissor Man". A womar s print in all 3 scenes. So this woman is with the Scissor Man? The Scissor Man... That wasn't... "Non Fiction Writer Koichi Yagihashi" You' re only half way there. Nicotine is just as poisonous as prussic acid. You could' ve died, you know. Arert you a fraid? Of what? You may not understand... But I feel it. My hands are stained with blood. I feel the guilt. I can't breathe when I think of the girls I've killed. I can't sleep when I think how sad my family would feel. Hello? It 's Isobe from Meguro Police. What do you want? We 'd like to ask more questions. I know about you. I'm gonna tell you who you are. You' re not ill or insane. Because you are the illness and insanity itself. You could say that I'm crazy. And so you' ve become my symptom. Stop blabbering! Hello? It' s funny. You don't have the monster in you. Because you are the monster itself. I can never disobey you. What are you, really? Empty. Inside and out. I'm the emptiness in between. A mar s voice? I'm sure of it. It' s started already. What has? Get the Superintendent. He' s in a meeting. Come! The nauseousness of strangling a girl. Don't! The squeal that comes out of her throat. Sorry I'm late. The blade penetrating the flesh. Shut up. Shut up! Open up or I'm telling the police. I know who the Scissor Man is. You are, Chika Yasunaga. I heard about the 2 scissors. You told me that Yukiko wasn't killed by the Scissor Man. That leads to one answer, you' re the Scissor Man. Knock it off, Hidaka. I have nothing to say to you. I sa w it. I sa w you throw a way something in the bushes. Then it hit me. It was a pair of scissors. You' re the Scissor Man. Stop staring. What was that? So he' s not the guy at the burger shop. Why don't you come in? I'm not going inside. There' s no telling what you' II do. Come with me. Alright. They' re vacationing abroad... Wait! Superintendent? What' s the matter? Where is he? He' s at home with a cold. At home? It can't be... What? Go and find him, now! Search everywhere. He' s dangerous. Carry a gun with you. I'II do the explaining. Hurry! What' s it about? Horinouchi. Who? Come on! He said "archery". When I asked him why she was late? The report didn't say anything about an archery club. Let' s split up. Get in the car! If you lift a finger, I'II stop the car and yell... that you' re the Scissor Man. I'II do the same thing. I wonder who they' d believe. When we called him about the scissors... he came in 30 minutes. His house should be in Saitama. Then we found out that he lived here in Meguro. There' s nothing special about that. Use your head. Why did he conclude that the killer was the Scissor Man? Because... Yukiko' s mother was the beneficiary. She has a motive. How about the men Yukiko dumped? You can't ignore these possibilities. But... So we went around with Horinouchi' s picture. Have you seen these men? These two. How about him? Look carefully. I see. Here' s another. Do you recognize him? The witness... Horinouchi was witnessed. He was seen with Yukiko. No! Let' s go. Didrt you want to talk? It' s unbelievable. The Scissor Man is a woman. And such a beautiful one, too. Don't worry, I didn't bring my scissors. Do you mind not smoking? The smoke damages the computer. So? I'm not surprised. Horinouchi and Yukiko were lovers. Got it. No wonder he told us that he' s no good in the field. This, too. He was a fraid someone would recognize him. What is it? There 's no one in Chika 's room. This is bad. Let' s split up. I'II go ahead. Right. Why did you kill Yukiko? It wasn't me, honest. That seems to be true. You' re not the burger guy. Then why are you bugging me? I want you to join us on the net as the Scissor Man. A chat between the Scissor Man and me. Doesrt the idea sound exciting? I don't know what your expecting but... I'm only taking it off because it' s her fa vorite shirt. What' s that voice? You forgot the thermos. I know you' re in there, Scissor Man. I want to talk to you. Let him in. I noticed a car following you. He' s the man you' ve been dying to meet. Chika, are you alright? I'm Horinouchi from the police. Where is he? Who? The Scissor Man. Hidaka, who kidnapped you. He' s over here. Freeze. So... I see. We were all fooled by the press. I thought you were a man. I get it now. I know why the victims weren't sexually abused. And why they followed you right a way. It explains everything. Nice to meet you at last, Scissor Man. The pleasure' s all mine, the killer of Yukiko Tarumiya. So you were that middle-aged guy at the burger shop. A double personality. There' s another person inside of you. You can talk to each other. You suffer from delusions. You' re going to be an interesting case for my research. I knew that the killer had something to do with the police. Oh? Yukiko' s clothing was left untouched. Even I thought it was the work of the Scissor Man. But it was too perfect. The police were hiding the fact that the victims hadrt been raped. What kind of killer would know about that? Easy. He' s one of the police. You' re pretty smart for a psychopath. Oh yes. You only liked smart girls. Why did you kill Yukiko? She told me she was pregnant. What? I've never heard such a stupid story in my life. Don't get me wrong. That wasn't the problem. I told her to have the child. Then what was the problem? When I said so, she laughed. What' s funny? I'm not pregnant. I just wanted to see how a respectable man would react. I have no intention of marrying you. The game' s over. So that' s why she seemed happy. I get it now. Isn't it hilarious? It was a game for her. I was just another character in her comic books. So love turned to hate? Your pride was torn to pieces, poor you. On the contrary, I feel sorry for you. What? If you weren't at the scene, you wouldn't have been caught. But don't worry. You won't be sentenced to death. They' II let you stay in a hospital for insanity. Scissor Man. You' re a specimen for my research. You must be crazy. No, you' re the one who' s crazy, you homicidal maniac. Get real. You' ve killed 2 high school girls. Look at what you' ve done. How can you do such a cruel thing? Drop the gun, please! You got it all wrong. You were intimate with Yukiko. There are witnesses. You can't escape now. Isobe. You' re making a big mistake. Here' s my chance to die. What? Don't! Your fa vorite shirt got bloody. What a shame. You don't get to die instantly when you' re shot in the stomach. Chika! Are you alright? You' ve killed both the Scissor Man and the finder of the body! Are you saying... that I killed Hidaka and shot her? There' s no excuse! Alright. That' s exactly it. So I murdered Yukiko, and killed the others to make them shut up. Right? And she' s innocent as a lamb. I don't mind. That' s how you commit suicide. The bullet will hit the medulla oblongata, and you can die instantly. I feel sleepy. So do I. This way! Isobe' s in there. Let' s go! It' s for you. Mina, Masayo and Yukiko. I guess we were mislead by their appearances. They were smart but played around with men. It' s no wonder they became a target. But don't you think it was unfair? Not telling me about Horinouchi. They made a fool out of me! That' s the first time you smiled. I feel comfortable with you. Really? Wow. I've gotta go, but I'II see you soon. Just one more thing. What kind of sneakers do you wear? I don't wear sneakers. Oh. I see. You can go now. Thanks a lot. What a relief. She only wears them at the crime scene, Isobe. "I feel comfortable"? Why did you make me say that? You could have a cop boyfriend. Shut up! Oh? A visitor. I'm going. Does it hurt? I've brought your things. You kept this all along. I miss him. He' s so young in the picture. The dead don't have to grow old. 10 long years. It' s been 10 years now. Father! Father! Wake up... My god! Don't look! Father... You didn't talk to me. Father hated me. That' s why he didn't tell me anything. I've told you a dozen times. Your father died because he was deeply in debt. You were only a child at the time so you couldn't understand. Forget it. It' s not your fault. If I were decent, he wouldn't have died! You' re so selfish. Dying all alone. Taking care of things by yourself. So selfish. Never thinking how we' d feel. Give it back. Now! No... Where are you? Come out! I'm going. It can't be. What are you doing? Chika? Where are you? You haven't gone a way? What' s happened to you? Where are you?! Don't lea ve me... You' re here, too? I envied you. You had a place to hide. Someone to protect you. Someone strong. But he' s gone now. Why don't you come with me? It' s what you' ve always wanted. So selfish. Never thinking how we' d feel. Come. I'm not committing suicide. But you' re a murderer. You' re right. I killed them all. But I'm not weak like you. Weak? You wanted attention so much that you ignored people on purpose. You' re just like a spoiled kid. That' s why you' re weak. If I go with you, people will think we' re the same. Why don't you disappear? I don't need anymore personalities. I'm fine on my own. You' re back! You don't need me. Why do you say that? Because I said that I'm fine on my own? All I meant was, I didn't need her. That' s right... You liked girls who are smart and pretty. Girls like her. No. Liar. You killed yourself because... I stop going to school and my grades dropped. No. Don't lie to me. I used to lock myself in the room and looked shabby all the time. That' s why you hated me and killed yourself. Chika. No father wouldn't love his own daughter. Then... You didn't hate me? I've loved you. Always. I was relieved to hear you say you weren't committing suicide. You' II be fine without me. Good bye, Chika. Don't go! You can't go yet. Chika, you' re not a murderer. I'm the Scissor Mans. So I'm taking care of it myself. I'm going to jump. This time, for you. Only for you. Then the Scissor Man will disappear. I'II forget about you, and you' II forget about me. It' s a promise. Chika. Thank you for thinking about me all these years. I'm sorry, Chika. Father... Father! There you are! We' ve been looking all over for you. Thank god, you' re alright. What would you do if I were the Scissor Man? The case is closed already. You saw the Scissor Man die. You' re right. Don't worry, Chika. You can win the life. I'm hungry. Let's have breakfast. That' s a good idea! Let' s go eat.
