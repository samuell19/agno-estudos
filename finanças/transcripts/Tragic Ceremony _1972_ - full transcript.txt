TRAGIC CEREMONY What's that thingy called? - Which thingy? - The big sail up there. Oh, that's the jib. Nope, sorry. That's the spanker. You got another wrong answer, bud. - What about that one? - That's a bell. Yeah, correct, but even a baby could have answered that. Can you name those small cables climbing up along the mast? Those small cables? How am I supposed to know? They're called ties, wires, whatever! Nope again! Those are the mainsail halyard and the jib halyard! Wrong answers, Bill. Totally wrong. Will you ever get anything right, Bill? You might be the son of a great industrialist, but you don't know squat as far as boats are concerned. You're only good at spending money. - It's like you enjoy knowing nothing! - Who gives a damn about the boat! I can barely tolerate using it once a year! Well, the old saying is true. "Youth is wasted on the young", indeed. Come on, now. Don't get too mad at us. At the end of the day, you're the only one among us who can afford to lose. By the way, Jane... How many wrong answers has he given since this morning? How do I know? I don't care about this stuff. It's a stupid game. Besides, Bill knows how much he owes you guys. I'm not making much progress as a sailor. I'm still getting the names of the sails wrong. And those names are sailing 101. Anyway, you owe me 50 pounds. And, unless I'm mistaken, you owe me 32 pounds. I reckon I've written down everything correctly. Well, here's your money. Your 50 pounds. And your 32 pounds. - And you, Jane? - What? How much do I owe you? How much have I lost to you? Forget about it, Bill. You don't owe me anything. I just want to enjoy life. Well, I'm going to get some water. Tell me something, Joe. You're from Andalusia, how come you know boats so well? An Andalusian gypsy, to be precise. When I heard Bill had invited us on his father's boat, I studied all the names of the sails and set up the quiz. - Pretty cunning, huh? - You're a real SOB, man. You scared me, Bill. Here. This is for you. Sorry. - For me? Really? - Yes. Thanks, you really shouldn't have! Can you help me, please? Thanks. It's a wonderful gift. These pearls are gorgeous. It's your beauty that makes them appear gorgeous, Mom. Are you making fun of your old mother? But it's the truth. I'd never lie to you, and I think you're the most beautiful woman in the world. I've bought those pearls more for the story connected to them than for their beauty. - A strange story? - Yes. An antique dealer on Church Street sold them to me. He said they belonged to a crazy old woman who was apparently possessed by the devil. According to her, Satan got her through the pearls. So she went to a medium who managed to exorcise her. The woman gave him the pearls as a sign of gratitude. Some time later, the exorcist and his family died under mysterious circumstances. You still bought them despite this story? Come on, Mom. Don't tell me you believe such a silly story. No, no. I don't believe it. But I don't want to own something like that. It would be bad taste. You understand what I mean, right? Come on, don't act like that. You'll give me another gift, Bill. I made another deposit into your account. I don't want you to have any money issues. Thank you. By the way, our manager is coming to dinner tonight. You're free to skip it altogether, if you wish. It'll be a business meeting, after all. I don't want you getting bored to death. Hey, don't tell me we're leaving now that I'm starting to enjoy myself! We'd better leave when there's still light out. No, let's stay here a little longer. This place is so awesome! Well, fine by me. I'm in. You should be ashamed of yourself for not sharing that cigarette! You look so funny! What happened? - Great, just what we needed! - What's wrong? Did we run out of gas? How can it be? Our tank's half full, I don't get it. Bloody rotten luck! What the hell are we going to do now? Well, I guess we need to find a gas station. "My gas, my gas, my kingdom for some gas', to quote some famous fella! Did I tell you guys that this is a push car? - All right, all right... - What a drag to end today like this. Jane, you get behind the wheel. - Come on! Come on! - Push, everybody! I'd bet my cojones this gas station will sort us out. What do you want? What do we want, you ask? What could we possibly want in a place like this? Let's see the color of your credentials first. Credentials? What are you talking about? I mean the color of your banknotes. No money, no gas. Oh, that's what you meant. Well, no worries, I have traveler's checks. Here. Satisfied with the color? Very. Now show me some ID. All right, as you wish. Where did I put it? Dammit! Who can guarantee me that you didn't steal those traveler's checks? If they're hot and I accept them, you see, I could end up in the slammer. You're talking nonsense, man. Those checks are mine, I don't need to steal anything. Ask them if I'm telling the truth. I could buy a hundred dumps like yours, if I wanted to! Whatever, kid. No cash, no gas. Come on, pal. Just calm down. I can assure you those traveler's checks are his. I've got one too right here, see? Sure, sure... Desolated, but I ain't getting screwed. Where did I... Of course! I probably left it on the beach, when we took down the tent! If I retrace my steps using the shortcut across the fields, I think I should be able to get there in two or three hours. - Where did you camp out? - Lighthouse Point. Say, do you enjoy being such a jerk? I gotta return home to my parents, and there's a storm brewing. Wait... Oh, to hell with it. Old Sam here never left a pretty girl stranded on the side of the road. - Hey, we need more! - It's enough to get to town. Take the first road on the left, it's a shortcut. Hey, what's wrong now? Don't tell me we're out of gas again? You gotta be kidding me. Yup, I'm afraid we're officially out of gas again. Son of a bitch! That senile asshole screwed us! He screwed us real good! What the heck you doin', Joe? Relax, bud! I see some cars at the end of this driveway! And where there are cars there's also gas! What do you want? Our car ran out of gas and we need some help, see. Come inside. Put your car in the garage. Thanks! Let's go, guys! They said to come inside! Come on! Almost there, push it! Push! Keep going, don't stop! Almost there. Damn, would you look at this bunch of old ass cars. Yeah, that one's a pre-war Rolls Royce. Whatever, I'd do god knows what to own one just like it. Forget about the Rolls for a minute, guys. We gotta find the garage first. Maybe it's behind the house. Move it, guys! It's pouring like crazy! - Come on! - Turn the car! Take a look, guys. It's another vintage Rolls Royce. It looks like the owners collect them like people do with stamps! Bill, see if you can find some gas around here. Good evening. You chose a bad night to run out of gas. But don't worry, you'll find as much as you need here. I would suggest you to wait here until the storm passes. You're very kind, but we don't want to impose on your hospitality. - We just need some... - I'm Lord Alexander and this is my house. Hospitality is sacred here. It's a group of kids. I let them in. They're in the garage now. - And our friends? - They're waiting downstairs. Give it a try. No luck. It won't start. What could have happened? Maybe the spark plugs got wet, who knows. Let's push it again, maybe it'll start. Come on, start pushing. Let's go. You, too. - What a drag! - Stop moaning. Come on, people! - Fucking hell! - This freaking car won't start! Give it another try, come on. What's the point? Tell your friends to come in and take shelter. Joe, Bill! Come inside! You can spend the night in the servants' quarters, who are off until tomorrow. Thanks. You're very kind. Feel free to eat the food in the pantry, make yourselves at home. I have other guests, so I'm afraid I won't be able to spend time with you. You're wet. You will sleep in the guestroom next to mine. I'm gonna eat something, guys. I'm starving. The bathroom is ready. - Thanks. - A good, hot bath will do you wonders. I've put some tea on the table, if you'd like a cup. You wouldn't happen to have a cigarette, too? Mine are wet. You'll find the cigarettes in the nightstand. Stop playing, man, you're busting our balls with that bore! Leave him alone, Joe, it's fine. Keep playing, I like it. Fred is very talented. He could even become famous. This world'll eat you alive if you don't have some powerful jerk backing you. Speaking of powerful jerks, I want to talk to my father. He could help him. That bastard is living the golden life. The only thing he couldn't buy's love. Few people realize that's something you can't get with money. Nah, money can buy everything. What about a round of poker? I've lost my inspiration. What do you say, Bill? Al right. But I don't want to play all night, got it? And let me clear something up first. Don't think you can fool me twice, like you did with that sailboat game. Come on, we were just messing around with you. I actually wanted to give you back the check. Well, once I'm able to find it, of course! Forget about it. You guys managed to keep me entertained, after all. - The lights went out! - It's this damn storm! Let me see if I can find a candle. Hey, you okay? You nuts, mate? What's wrong with you? I saw the gas station attendant spying on us at the window! Come on, Bill, that's nonsense. You must have imagined it. Who takes a stroll in this kind of weather? Come on, let's go back inside. Here you go, guys. That's all I could find. Well, it's better than nothing. Let's get back to our game. Where the hell did they put Jane? You think she might be in danger? Come on, gimme a break. Sure, the owner's got that Dracula-like expression, but he was very kind and generous to us. Yeah, but Jane's alone now, and she could even be... Stop worrying, Jane is more than capable of handling herself. Maybe you're right, but she could at least let us know she's still alive! He'll never admit it, but our friend really hoped to get laid tonight. O, Angel of Evil, who lived in Heaven and now rules the bottomless pits of Hell... O, Angel of Evil, who lived in Heaven... O, Angel of Evil, who lived in Heaven and now rules the bottomless pits of Hell... Hallowed be thy name. We worship you as our God. Hallowed be thy name. We worship you as our God. Hallowed be thy name. Well, I'm going to go take a look around. Rest in peace, guys. Joe! Joe, look! We found Jane's clothes in one of the rooms! I told you there's something that doesn't feel right about this place! We must keep our cool, guys, we don't know for sure these are Jane's pearls. Maybe you're right. But we better find her soon. Damn you! Damn you! No! Let me go! Let me go! No! No! No! No! No! Don't stop! Let's get out of here! Damn you! Damn you! Look out, Bill! Oh, good evening. Good evening. Thank goodness you're here. Something wrong, Miss? Well, we missed our way home. Where do you live? Chelsea. It's not too far. There's a crossroad about three miles from here. You'll find a sign to help you find the way. Don't go too fast, you'll get there just the same. - Good night. - Good night. Good night. Good night. Let's go, Bill. What do we do now? I suggest we go to your house, then we'll plan our next move. All right, but there's something we gotta do first. We need to find some gas. I say we go to that gas station again. It's in an isolated area, at least. Bad idea, that geezer won't give us anything without an ID. No problem, then. I've found my ID, I had it in my pocket. Why? You got a better plan? No, but if that jerk doesn't give us enough gas this time, I'll break his face! It's his fault we found ourselves in that black mass, we oughta kick his ass! Let's get going. Jane! Aren't you coming? I swear it's the same gas station we've encountered before. It seems like it's been out of business for years. Something's not right here. It's the same one. Either that or I'm losing my mind. But it can't be! Think about it! We could try getting home with the gas we have left. Let's get away from here, at least. Bill! Is something wrong? I expected you to return tomorrow! The storm made us change our plans. I'd also like to host my friends for the night. Mom, I need to speak with you for a minute. Yes, yes, but not now. I wonder if you realize how late it is. Besides, the guestrooms aren't ready. I gave the staff a day off. Here. You can all go to a hotel. Come back tomorrow and we'll talk about everything. Dad hasn't come back yet? He forgets about his home and his family when he's with his hunting party. Excuse me, Madam, but I feel the need to say something. I don't want to invade your privacy, but don't you think your son had a good reason when he decided to bring us here? Maybe, but this is not the right time to discuss it. As you wish. Take this money. You'll need it for the hotel. All right, I'll give it to Bill. I don't want to sound rude, but I've already explained that I can't let you stay here on such short notice. I hope you understand. It's not that easy to understand you, believe me. You better leave now, if you don't want to be late. You mentioned a hotel, but the situation we're in makes that solution impossible. If you would allow us to explain, I'm sure we'll be able to solve our issue. Allow me to solve it on the spot. With more money. You are the perfect mother. Show her our gratitude, people! Let's go. Wait a minute. Go. Bill, the pearl necklace you gave me has disappeared. Do you know anything about it? I'm sure I put it in a drawer of my bedroom nightstand. Absolutely sure. No, I don't know anything at all about it. Good night. They're gone. I've always said that your son is a smart kid. Hop in, come on. - Are we going to a hotel? - No. We're going to my father's country house. We're taking these two motorcycles. But why? That makes sense. Somebody might have described Bill's car to the cops. - Want one? - Thanks. Did you ever meet Sam David? No. Who was he? The owner of this gas station. - He died about 15 years ago. - So? He was a weird guy. People were saying he was the devil in the flesh, or a close relative. Thanks. Gimme a break. I thought those dumb stories only got around in Scotland. He lived in there on his own. - Folks were scared shitless of him. - Even you? Calling Patrol 32, proceed to the crossing immediately. - I repeat, Patrol 32, proceed to the crossing immediately. - That's us. The old guy was pretty generous, though. He always gave people free gas. One could have covered this whole road with all the gas he gave away. And if he could give it to some pretty girl, even better. It sounds like this guy was not the devil, just a creep. Well, let's get to work. - Come on, open it! - I don't have the key. The only thing we can do is to break down the door. Well, if you say so. - Crap! - Hey, look where you're going! We can finally relax a little and get our thoughts together. Yeah, but for how long? Well, the way my mother was talking, my dad won't be back for a few days. You heard it yourselves. Besides, she could never stand this place. Let's hope that no one saw us. We haven't run into any cops. Except for those motorway patrolmen. Sure, but we were still a long way from this house. - The gas station attendant! - Yeah, you're right! That son of a bitch... What ever happened to him? It was his fault we went to that villa. Maybe that damn geezer was in cahoots with those folks. And then he went South when things turned sour. The guy was dodgy, I said it from the start. Anyway, I'm sure that he won't say anything. He'd find himself in trouble as soon as he opened his mouth. I'm beginning to think that he never existed. You may be right, actually. But a gas station can't disappear like that. Why are you all looking at me like that? What are you all worried about? I'm the one who's neck-deep in shit! Because I killed that woman! I killed her with my own hands! And that's an indisputable fact! - You can't convince me I imagined it! - Calm down, Bill! We are all in this together! I promise you we'll find a way out. Just try to calm down now, please! - Come on, Bill! - We gotta keep our cool, guys, or we're gonna be in trouble! We've got to let things calm down, then we'll plan our next move. The ghastly discovery was made by the officers of a patrol car, which was called to the scene by the servants of the villa. A scenario of such devastation that it looked like a monster or a steamroller... ...had wreaked havoc in Lord Alexander's house. Eight lives were violently, atrociously destroyed. The eight bodies that have been found at the scene. One of the victims fell to his death from a window on the second floor. Confusion reigns in the villa's courtyard. There's a constant movement of police cars. Even the chief commissioner of Scotland Yard has been summoned to the scene. I will now attempt to enter the house, in order to give you more details on this horrible tragedy. The bodies are being carried out, one at a time, and loaded into the ambulances that will transport them to the mortuary. I'm now inside the villa, as you can see. In the very room where the tragedy took place, as a matter of fact. Judging by the looks of it, it must have been the stage of a sort of black mass ceremony which ended horribly. It was a real massacre. The room has been turned upside down. An assortment of bladed weapons are being tagged and gathered, like this antique sword, and various firearms are being found everywhere. This man is Chief Commissioner Ferguson, who is personally supervising the evidence collection. From what we've gathered, the investigators are focusing on three strange details. Not of the same degree of gravity, but equally inexplicable nonetheless. A guitar not belonging to any member of the staff was found in the servants' quarters. Pearls, seemingly from a valuable necklace, were found spread on the stairs of the massacre room. There's one last grisly, mysterious detail. Lady Alexander wasn't accounted for among the eight bodies found at the scene. Unfortunately, it would seem apparent that the noble woman was murdered as well. According to the latest findings, it would seem that this gruesome massacre, strangely reminiscent of Sharon Tate's murder, could be linked to the presence of a small group of hippies in the villa. Their presence would explain the discovery of the guitar. This is the trail the investigators seem to be currently following. Jane! Where's Bill? Bill! Bill! Bill, you there? Jane! Jane! Fred! Bill's upstairs! Come! What happened, Joe? Bill is... Oh, it's horrible! What are you talking about? What's horrible? Speak! Joe! What happened to Bill? Answer me, dammit! He's upstairs! Dead inside a closet! Calm down, Joe! You're not making sense! No, Fred! It's horrible! Come and see! Hurry! You too, Jane! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up, I said! Who could have killed him, Joe? Look at the terror in his eyes. What should we do now? The only thing we should do is make the body disappear and get away from here! Move it, Joe! Give us a hand here! Let's barricade the door! Pull yourself together, Fred. He looked at me with those eyes. He kept staring at me... Joe? What happened to him? He's not dead. Who? Who killed him? - Fred, calm down. - Tell me who killed him. - Come on, you need to rest now. - Who killed him? Tell me, tell me... I want to know it. Tell me, Joe... What's happening, Jane? What's going on? Are we doomed to all end up like Bill? What were you doing on that altar? Answer me, Jane! Speak up! We'll find a logical explanation to all this madness! Jane, answer me! Say something! It was a tragedy. Calm down. There's nothing we can do. We can still save ourselves, though. Fred, try not to think about it. Try to get some rest, please. Sleep, now. When you wake up, you'll think all this madness was just a bad dream. I'm scared. I'm so scared, Jane. I feel so cold! Don't leave me... - Don't leave me, Jane. - I have to go. I'll be back soon. Fred... Not him, too! Quick, we must get away from here! There's no time to waste! Yes, yes, let's go! No... No! Jane, help! Jane! Help me! My legs are broken! Help! Jane! Don't let me die! Jane! I can't hold on anymore! I don't think you'll get anything out of this girl, Inspector. At least for now. But I must question her as soon as possible. She's the only person who can shed some light on what happened, Doctor. Especially concerning the strange disappearance of Lady Alexander's body. The girlie in a deep state of shock. But I'm here to investigate, Doctor! I kindly ask you to stop insisting, Inspector. Take her back to her room. Do you need anything? Doctor! Doctor! Where to, Milady? To the villa, of course. Very well, Milady. Doctor, I made the rounds five minutes ago, and everything looked normal. But who could have killed her? No one killed her. You see, Inspector, the actual explanation is that she was already dead. I'm aware that what I'm saying may sound illogical. Absurd, even. In all honesty, I couldn't possibly explain her mysterious death any other way. It all started when Jane found herself in that room during the black mass. She was probably under the influence of a drug Lady Alexander gave her. Something to impede any sort of reaction. Jane left her body under those conditions, but she remained connected to her physical self through a spiritual link. Lady Alexander was killed shortly after. I'm certain that woman possessed exceptional psychic powers. Our extrasensory faculties are at their peak when we are on the edge of death, and that's why her spirit managed to penetrate Jane's body. From that moment on, the spirit of Lady Alexander owned Jane's body, despite the efforts of that poor girl to drive the woman away. Alas, it was a useless struggle. And now, Jane's real death has marked the rebirth of Lady Alexander. Look for her. Find her and you'll have the true culprit. You'll have all the answers surrounding this mystery. THE END
