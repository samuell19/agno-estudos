Two [mumbles] please. - Right. [groovy jazz music] [muffled intercom announcer] - How'd you like the movie? - Story's a little weak, but I like the actor. - Do you know of Henke? Do you think you can take him? - What'd he do? - Henke? He's done everything really. Almost all of it despicable. Some of the KGB surveillance list for the Kosygin visit. They see him as a potential assassin. - Throw him in jail. - No no no, dear boy. See, he's a professional agitator. As soon as you slap him in jail, the Civil Liberty's Union springs him right out again. I loathe those people, really. Henke, I'm afraid will have to be assaulted away [mumbles]. [groovy jazz music] - [Shaver] Listen, I don't do that kinda work. - No? Oh, dear. Tell me, didn't I hear that you were on suspension? You took it into your hand to slap Inspector McDermott in the eye. Nice. Yeah, well done. [chuckles] - Are you suggesting that if I wanna get back on the force, I gotta break the law? [muffled intercom announcer] [gun cocking] [muffled intercom announcer] - Think of it as a first job in a new career. - How long do I have? - No later than Thursday. Oh and Shaver, dear boy, it's a piece of cake. [clicks] [van roaring] [soft investigative music] - I can assure you, Colonel Vostik within 36 hours, Henke will be outta the way. - You know the importance we attach to it. - Can't be at all reluctant to make that clear, Colonel. - I am not reluctant to emphasize it once again. Henke is a dangerous man. Perhaps not to you in this country where he only makes a nuisance of himself. But to Russia and the Russians, he is a definite threat. - Yes, Colonel. - He mistakenly believes he has a reason to hate us because of a certain excesses in Latvia. - You mean, of course, when his entire family was wiped out? - Captain Ferguson, we want Henke off the streets. If not, be assured Premier Kosygin's visit will be canceled. [airplane roaring] - Is there anything else I can get for you, sir? - No, that's beautiful. It's beautiful. Here. - Thank you very much, sir. - Get some new hair for a transplant. - [Attendant] Yes, sir. - [groans] It's terrible. [phone ringing] Hello, hello. Yeah, I'm here. [chuckles] Yeah. Listen, lemme ask ya. If he struggles, can I kill him? [siren wailing] [muffled kids shouting] [Henke chuckling] - Come on, give us the ball back. [window shattering] [kids screaming] - Hey! Hey come here, you little bastards! Hey, hey! [Henke laughing] Hey, come back here you little bastards. [Henke chuckling] [muffled sports announcer speech] [energetic orchestral music] [water trickling] [soothing orchestral music] [muffled sports announcer speech] [door banging] [water trickling] [typewriter clanking] [machine whirring] - Shaver, you really shouldn't be here. It's bad form. - Oh hello Sub-Inspector Benson, how are ya? - You're on suspension, dammit! You're not authorized personnel. What were you looking for, anyway? - Just checking to see if I got a record yet. - Well I should say you have, but it's not available to you 'til you're back at work. That, I can assure you will be a very long time if Inspector McDermott happens to see you here. - Ooh, can he see now? [switchboard buzzing] - RCMP? Hi, Tim. One moment please. RCMP? One moment please. You back? - Looking for Bogna. - She's at the dentist. RCMP? Yes sir, one moment please. I thought it was all over with you two. - It is, I just wanna ask her a question. - You could've called. [switchboard buzzing] RCMP? One moment please. [phone ringing] [soft guitar music] - Hello? - Did you sleep well? - [Bogna] Tim, do you know what time it is? - I love you, you hear? - Send me a letter. - Wait a second. Bogna, it's about this guy Henke. I was supposed to grab him at Special Branch, but he got away. - [Bogna] Hey, I thought you called to tell me that you loved me. - I did. I do, but I've been tryin' to find him all night and I really need your help now. Can you tell teletype Ottawa? - You know I can't do that. - I wouldn't ask this of you unless it was really important. - Well alright, I'll see what I can do. - You're a sweetheart. - But it'll cost you a lunch at the Timber Club. - You got it, noon. - Okay, bye. [car engine roaring] [tires screeching] [siren wailing] [soft jazz music] - Will you put this on his bill, please? I hope you don't mind, dear boy, but I asked the barman to put this on your bill. What are you doing here? - I wanna talk to you about Henke. - I see you want my personal congratulations. You're not satisfied with the press clippings. Someone gave a pretty good description of you. - Yeah, I heard a door close. - Blood all over. He put up a fight, did he? - Yeah. Yeah, he's tough. - Would you mind telling me where you got him stashed? - I never wanna use that place again. [clicks] - Is there something you're not tellin' me, Shaver? - Funny, I was gonna ask you the same question. [printer clacking] - [Woman] Will you repeat Brian Hardison, over. - [Shaver] Affirmative. Brian Hardison, where is he? - [mumbles] inquiry - Received 2312. - [Man] Proceeding to West Band, over. - Received, 261. Ron, some cowboys are looking for Hardison. Do you know where he is? - Yeah, old Brian sent him up to the Grouse Nest. - RCMP car 43. [mumbles] RMCP car 43, you'll find him at Grouse Nest. - Grouse Mountain, 10-4. [whistles] [typewriter clacking] - Are you sure you heard... [speaking Russian] Tell me, did you really hear the whole conversation? - Every word, Colonel. - You must have known you were listening. It was a manufactured conversation to throw us off the track. - No, Colonel. Shaver did not tell his superior that he does not have Henke. - But why? This is bad. This is very bad. Costing us more now. It makes for unnecessary complications. [mumbles], where is he now? - He's having a manicure, Comrade Colonel. - Go get him. - He's at the Grouse Mountain. - Hi. - What's goin' on up there? - I don't know. - [Man] One car ready ready. - Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to Grouse Mountain. We are going to lift at approximately 2,700 feet or just about 1/2 a mile vertical. To do this, we must travel just over one mile. Our destination at the top of the mountain is the Grouse Mountain chalet. Coming into view now is the manmade Capilano Lake. Left from this, you can see Vancouver's west end with which its many high-rises is the second-most populated densely area in... It's my first day. Manhattan being first. There are 40 people per square... There are 40,000 people per square mile. If you have any questions, I will be pleased to try to answer them for you. May I have your attention again please? We are now approaching the chalet which was opened in 1966. It is open year-round. It contains on the main floor of the Alpine Cafeteria which is now open and the Alpine Market for international gifts, souvenirs and Canadian arts and crafts. Upstairs you'll find the cocktail lounge which opens for lunch and refreshments at noon and the Grouse Mountain Nest Restaurant which opens for dinner at six o'clock. Thank you very much for coming and come ski with us again. [muffled crosstalk] - Brian? Brian? - Oh hello, Tim. - Hey, how are you? You got a minute? - Sure. Come on over here. Now take it easy there, easy! - What's goin' on? - Mr Hardison-- - No no, later, later. I'm not sure yet. The calls were about 6:30 this morning. So far we've got a broken rail and a body. That's about all we know. You look a bit rattled, what's up? - Did you see the papers today? - Just the headlines. - You didn't read about Henke, Latvian's disappearance, foul play suspected? - No, why? - I was supposed to grab him for Special Branch. Somebody got there before me. There's somethin' screwy going on. I got a feeling I'm being set up. - What do you want me to do? - Can ya check the hospitals and the morgue just in case Henke comes in in a horizontal position? - Will do. - Oh and Brian? - Yeah? - Check John Petapiece, Commander Special Branch, will you? - When do you want me to let you know? - We better stay off the air; they think I'm holed-up with Henke. Make it Bogna's. - How is that going anyway? - I'm late for lunch with her right now. [eerie crime music] Hey! Hey, you down there! That's a police car! Hey you, you hear me?! Put that car down! Can you make this thing go faster? He might steal it. A police car. That car is legally parked! I'm the police! That's a police car! Stop that car! Stop that car! Hey! Hey, stop that fucker! Goddammit! Son of a bitch. - That's infuriating. I know he saw you. - Yeah. - Come on, get in. I'll take you into town. - Yeah, thanks. [crows cawing] - Oh boy, here it comes. You can always depend on the rain. Cigarette? - No, thanks. - What's going on up there? - Guy got killed skiing. - People take such chances, don't they? - Yeah, it's a dangerous world. - That's quite a car you got here. - Thank you. Actually, I just bought it. - You have a lot of buttons. Need a pilot's license to drive it? - Not really. As you see, everything's indicated. For instance, here's the horn. [horn honking] City horn. [horn beeping] That's the country horn. It does a lot of tricks. - Nice. Nice. - Those two guys seemed to be in trouble up there. Looks like it's my day to be the good Samaritan. You don't mind, do you? - Yes as a matter of fact, I do. Keep goin'. Show me another trick, pal. Show me now! [tires screeching] [intense chase music] Goodbye, boys! [soft piano music] - Would you like some lunch now? - No thank you, I think I've lost my appetite. - Thank you. - That's very good. Get out. - For what? There's nothin' here. - Get out of the car. Hold it right there. Gimme your piece. Gimme your wallet. - What is this, a shakedown? - Is this you, Raymond Ragulia? - Yeah. - Not Rags Ragulia? - Yeah. - From Detroit? Hey Rags, this for me? - No, no. I'm diabetic. - I see we've got a mutual friend here. - Who? - Where is he? - Who? - Henke, goddammit. - I don't know him. I never saw him before in my life. I don't know how that got in my case. Wait a minute, that's not my case. - Start walkin'. - Where? - Just start walking. [Raymond groaning] [intriguing music] - Can we do this downtown? - Come on. - Where we goin'? - Get in the middle. What'd you do with Henke? Keep walkin'! - I dropped him off. - Who with? - I don't know. - Who hired you, Rags? - I don't know anything. I don't know who. I just made a delivery, that's all. - What were you gonna do with me, sweetheart? Deliver me or drop me in a dead-letter box? - No, no. Hey listen, nothin' serious. - Rags, what were you gonna do with me? - Look, I was gonna deliver you to the guys at the bus. - Who are they, Rags? - I don't know. Foreigners, I don't know. - A lotta things; the same guys we handed Henke over to. - No, other guys. - Cross over, get on the outside. Go on, get on the outside! Go ahead. - You sure we can't do this downtown, huh? Hey you think I'm kidding, don't ya? You think you're not goin' for a swim. You think we're just here to enjoy the view, right? - Stop right there. Move out. Move out. - Now, c'mon. You're really crazy, you know that? [Raymond mumbling] Goddammit. I'm going. What's the matter with you? You're a cop. You know how guys like me work. I'm a businessman. I get an assignment, I follow through, I make a delivery. I don't know to who. An address, names, that's all it is to me. - Don't gimme this horseshit, just gimme the names. - I can't even for Christ's sake pronounce the names, let alone remember 'em! - Make an effort. - I'll tell you what. I'm gettin' 30,000 for this job, that's yours. That's yours. C'mon, you don't see 30,000. You don't get 30,000 your whole freakin' lifetime. - Look, I'm late for lunch. Think or swim. Come on! - What's the matter with you? [screams] [water splashing] [seagulls squawking] [somber jazz music] - Bogna, Tim's been calling. - Tell him I died. [window tapping] - You go on ahead, meet you at the lab. - Hi. - Hi Brian. - Get in. - Follow my car. I've got a meeting downtown later. [horn honking] - Okay Midge, I'll hold. [phone ringing] - City Analysts Lab, just a minute please. I believe it's for you. - Hello? - Hello. - Miss Kershov is not accepting calls from Corporal Shaver. - Oh yes, he's right here. Hold on a minute, will ya? - Bogna says hello. - Your pal at the motor vehicles' branch. - Thanks. Hi. Right. Got it, thanks. - Well? - Jensen is registered to a man with a phony name. Man with a phony name lives at a phony address. - Stolen? - Bought only a week ago. - Well that shouldn't be too hard to trace. - What did the lab say about the hyperderal? - Low Ketamine, 800 milligrams. - What can that do to a guy? - Knock him out. If you cut his head off, he wouldn't feel a thing. - Figures. I see you got a homicide. - Yeah, our friend from the mountain. - No kidding so it was murder, huh? - Yup. - D'you get anything for me? - So far just an address from Commander Petapiece. Hotel Europe, [mumbles]. - [Shaver] Right. - If it's about Henke, why are they bothering with you? - Who knows? Maybe the ones who are bothering with me aren't the same ones who bothered with Henke. - Maybe it's all a plot by McDermott. - What do you mean by that? - Get even with you for what you did to his eye. - No. - What are you doin' for Christmas? - Staying home as usual. - Upgrade. - Hi Wayne, any prints? - All kinds, all yours. - Clean? - It's spotless. Find out who owns it? - Yeah, nobody. If I get anything else Tim, I'll you at Bogna's apartment. - Thanks, Brian. - It's a beauty. What're you gonna do with it? - He'll keep it for seven days. If nobody claims it, it's his. - That's the law, Brian. Got to uphold the law. - [mumbles] go now. [soft investigative music] [spray whooshing] - Why is he taking so long? He should have reported by now. Why did he go by you? He saw you standing there on the side of the road. He was supposed to stop. Why did he go by you? - [mumbles] all we saw was the car when it went by. There was nothing to see. - Nothin'. - Stop it. Alright, listen to me. [speaking Russian] We will give him one more hour, if there is nothing then. - Inspector, a breakdown-- - Put it on my desk, Benson; I'll take care of it tomorrow. - Yes, sir. - Hi, Midge. - Hi, Tim. - Bogna still here? - I'm not supposed to say. - Hello, Inspector. - You were on suspension Corporal, remember? - Yes, I remember. - Suspension means just that. All rights and privileges withdrawn. You have no business in our records room or being here or anything else. You are not a police officer. - Now, listen to me. - No no no no, you listen to me. - Hi, guys. - Hello, where are you going? - Ready? - To dinner. - Hey, terrific. I know just the place. - Just a minute! Shaver! - Do you want me to cancel your reservation, Inspector? - No. No. [soft jazz music] - They don't have curb service here, you know? - You can't park here, you know? - Look, I'm sorry about lunch. Somebody was tryin' to kill me. Things like that take time. - What are you taking about? - Come on, I'll tell you inside. Hey, watch the puddle. - Where'd you get that car? - D'you ever hear of a guy by the name of Raymond Regulia down at the office? - No. - [Shaver] Well anyway, it's his car. - Good, thank you. - Good evening. - Hi. - Reservations? - No. - No, are you staying for dinner or are you just having drinks? - Staying for dinner. - I think we're having drinks. - We're staying for dinner. [door buzzing] [soft intriguing music] [muffled crosstalk] - How would you like steak, sir? - Medium rare please. Rare. - Rare. - I don't know when they wanted to kill me. Maybe they just wanted to grab me, ask me a few questions, get me to do somethin', I don't know. Where's the file? - It's at home. - What? - I took it there after you stood me up. - How could you do that? - We'll get it after dinner, okay? [cutlery slashing] - What was in it? - What? - The file, what was in it? - I don't know, I didn't read it. - Bogna, somebody's tryin' to kill Kosygin. Somebody's tryin' to assassinate the Premier of Russia. All you can think about is what you're gonna eat. [shakers banging] - Alright, I got some chicken in the fridge. [Shaver mumbling] Hurry up. - Coming. - Did you lock the doors? - That's alright if somebody steals the car. Where you going? We're here. Wait until I get the keys. - Ooh please hurry up. I gotta go. - What's the matter with you? - I gotta go, that's what's wrong with me. Hurry up and unlock the door. - Done. - [Bogna] Can't you hurry up? - [Shaver] I'm tryin' to get the key out. - I have to go. - I thought girls were supposed to hold it. Hey, where's the file? - It's in the vase. - Where's the vase? - The vase is on top of the bookshelf. [Bogna sighing] - What's the matter? - The bathroom. [intriguing crime music] - Why don't you make some coffee? I think he came to tell me what I just read in that report. Henke's with the CIA. - Why don't you sit down and have your coffee? Should we tell headquarters about Brian? - Not yet. Petapiece. Petapiece. - I'm goin' with you. - You can't come with me. - I can't stay here. - Alright, stay at Midge's. - She's on night duty. - I'll drop you off. - Even if you are a cop, I don't know if I should be doin' this. - Just do it. Where's the light? - Right up there. - What time does he get in? - Late, usually late. - Where is he now, do you know? - Probably eatin'. - Where does he eat? - Christ, I don't know. - Well he must have some special place. Some place he likes to eat. - All I know is China Town. - Great, thanks. [intriguing fusion music] - Now it always sticks, so you have to turn it to the right, turn it to the left, then wiggle it 'til you get the key out. - Turn it to the left, then I turn it to the right and then jiggle it. - No no no. Turn it to the right. - Turn to the right, turn to the left, jiggle it and it'll come out. I mean it'll go in. [chuckles and mumbles]. - Do sit down, Shaver. There's always plenty of a Chinese meal for another, don't you find? Their sweet and sour shrimps are outstanding. What you want, Shaver? Shouldn't you be with our mutual friend? - Lemme see your badge, Petapiece. - I beg your pardon? - Your badge, I wanna see your badge. - Don't you think none of this astonishing? No, a favor. You asking for my credentials. What are yours, if I may ask? Except for those piddling chumps. - Like kidnapping a CIA stringer? - How curious, [mumbles] tell you that? - How curious that you didn't. - Top-secret information, Corporal. Maybe you didn't have to use persuasion to find it out. - Who else knows? - Just Special Branch. When the Russians wanted Henke locked up, what could Ottawa do, tell 'em that Henke was a hired CIA informer? Hardly likely, dear boy. No choice but to go along with the farce. Put him away for a while in your good care. - Great, so it's all a joke. - Not altogether. You're both necessary to put him on ice. You could hardly use one of our men. It wouldn't look too good if it came out. [chuckles] - Nice. - One must always look at the bright side of things in this grim world, don't you think? One felt one was doin' you a favor putting you back on the force. Besides, there's nothing that boosts the spirit like a little daring duel. - I'll keep that in mind. There's just one more thing. Do the Russians know Henke's CIA? - Don't concern yourself, dear boy. As you yourself just said, look it all as a joke. [chuckles] - As a joke? That's some funny joke! [plates crashing] [intense orchestral music] - It's wearing off. Inform the Colonel. He's bringing him out now. Get me a vodka. - Good morning, Corporal Shaver. - He's ready now. - Kavorki. - You can speak, can't you? - Sure, I can speak. - Good. I would like you to make a phone call. I think it is time you told Commander Petapiece that you don't have Henke. That you never had him. You are calling now so that Special Branch will have time to do whatever is necessary before Kosygin arrives, then you will hang up. [phone ringing] - Oh, hold on. - Of course, you will say all of this in your own way. Very naturally. - Hello? Hello? - Gorki. [intense crime music] - Hello? Speak up man, I can't hear you. - This is Shaver. Listen closely, I've got somethin' to tell ya. - Bridge. - Yes sir, I've completely covered both entrances. - Terminal entrance? - Yes, sir. - Pair of motorcycle officers? - Yes two in front, sir. - Granville Street. What about the limousines? - Two men with sidearms in every car. - Standby here Benson, there may be some fireworks. I just had Special Branch on the phone. While we had Shaver on suspension, they put him on official secret duty. - Andy, is Bogna in yet? - No she isn't, Midge. - Thank you. Inspector, could I interrupt you for a moment please? - Yes, Midge. - Bogna was supposed to have been in my apartment last night. - Yes? - She wasn't there when I got home. When I rang her this morning, there was no answer. - Miss Kershov isn't here yet? - [Andy] No sir, she isn't. - Go on Midge, I'll take care of it. - You've no idea where he is? - No idea. As soon as he told me he didn't have Henke, he hung up. - Don't you have a permanent trace on all your calls? - The entire conversation, my dear Ferguson, took place in a period not more than 1/2 a minute. - Yes. You been had, haven't you, Petapiece? It's too late now for any major changes of schedule. Get me Taggart in Ottawa. Call me when you have him. One thing we can be damn-well sure of, KGB has final say from this moment on. It's their show now. [phone slamming] [intriguing music] [hens clucking] - Hey come here, quick. How 'bout that? - Who is that? - It's Henke. - What are they gonna do with him and what are they gonna do with us? - What are they gonna do with him? What are they gonna do with us? You sure are full of questions. If it's any consolation, I can't get out of your sight. - It's not. - I'm gonna see if I can get that door open. - [Bogna] Here comes somebody. - [Shaver] Who's that? - You have the camera? - I have. - You must get very clear shots of Henke. - You will see every pore with this special long lens. - It is absolutely essential. Ah. Otherwise, it would be impossible to identify him. You understand there won't be anything left when he explodes? - Don't worry, it will all be here. - Is that my car? That's my car. That's the same son of a bitch who took it at the Sky Ride. The least they could've done is wash it. - Sure is hell of a lot of activity here than the other day. - Yeah, it must be somebody very important. Look, they got the [mumbles]. - Where are ya goin'? - Ey, watch where you're goin'. - [mumbles] the whole day's been hell. - It's gonna be a lot longer, too. - What do you mean? - Kosygin's plane has been delayed. It can't get here until at least early evening. - Christ, that's cozy. - How long will it take you to set this up? - 'Bout 10 minutes. - There's been a delay. Standby, I'll be in touch. [blades whirring loudly] - Is that a police walking on the side? - [Bogna] Uh huh. - Lars, go help him with Henke. - What are they doing? - Hold on, we'll see. [soft orchestral music] - Is that Henke? - That's Henke. Look, he's comin'. That's the answer to your first question. They're gonna use Henke to kill Kosygin. They'll blow him up like a firecracker right on top of the old man's head. - But they're Russian and Kosygin is Russian. - They do that from time-to-time. - Why? - Because Kosygin's comin' here to talk about arms reduction peace in our time. Suppose somebody in the KGB doesn't like that. What's the best way to get rid of Kosygin? - You got me. - You blow him up with the CIA bomb on Canadian soil. Two countries with the same bang. Not to mention coverin' the RCMP with a little mud at the same time. 'Cause we were supposed to get Henke off the street, weren't we? Well hello, gentlemen. [bombs smashing and fizzing] Aww, don't do that. [Bogna and Shaver coughing] - [Man] Report from the citizens of [mumbles] Town in the middle of [mumbles]. [somber orchestral music] - It'd be nice if you're gonna call me. Go ahead, 121. Are you available to check-in, 171? - [Dispatcher] Attention all special units. Attention all special units. Premier Kosygin's arrival time is now as per original schedule. Repeat, Premier-- [tires screeching] [car clunking] [foreboding music] [smoke fizzing] - You alright? - Yeah. Yeah, I think so. [van engine roaring] [birds chirping and cawing] [intense chase music] - Maintain a fixed position until rendezvous. You'll be in range by the time I reach the bridge. I will call you then. [blades whirring] [intense percussion music] - You alright? - Yeah. [doorbell ringing] [dog barking] [window tapping] - Hi, I'm with the RCMP. We seem to have a little emergency. Do you have a phone I could use? - Oh yes, I have. It's right through in the kitchen. - I'm glad that everybody-- - [Reporter] Here's a huge jet that has traveled cross-country all the way from campus of Ottawa. - Come on. Yeah, Shaver. S-H-A-V-E-R, Shaver! You idiot, can't you hear me? - I'm trying to connect you, Corporal. Hold a moment. There's a call coming in on four, too. Urgent, trace it. [extinguisher fizzing] [fire crackling] [car exploding] - [Reporter] Just now the motorcade is forming up. - [Shaver] Hello, hello? - [Reporter] We'll take the parties to the Hotel Vancouver and to the waiting Prime Minister of Canada. [muffled shouting] [motorcycle roaring] - [Shaver] Do you have a car I could borrow? - [Woman] The keys are on the table. Use the rental. - I'll remember that. Listen, do you think you could call the police one more time? Ask for a Mr Benson. - Mr Benson. - Right, tell him that the KGB is going to kill Kosygin. - The KBG. - The KGB. - KGB is going to kill Kosugin. - Kosygin. - Kosygin. - Who are you gonna ask for? - Mr Benson. - Right and you're gonna tell them? - That the KGB are going to kill Kosugin. - Kosygin. - Kosygin. - Terrific. Thank you very much for your help, bye bye. - Bye. [intense orchestral music] [both grunting] - Tim! - Stop it! [shovel clanging] Stop it! [fist thudding] [man wincing] [Bogna screaming] - I'll call Mr Benson. - Thank you so much. [intriguing percussion music] [military band music] - Inspector, Shaver's in a blue Dodge 1960. License: Romeo, Charlie, Tango, 872. He's probably at the bridge by now. The woman's nearly berserk. She's got a dead man on her lawn. Shaver was yelling something about the KGB. He said they're tryin' to kill Kosygin. - Buy me some time. Slow this goddamn parade down. - Yes, sir. Report. [energetic crime music] [sirens wailing] - Say, who's in that car? - It's Inspector McDermott, sir. - Really? We've gotta have an explanation. I'm sure he does. [blades whirring] - This thing has been reading empty now for the last 15 minutes. Sittin' in the parkin' lot. [horn honking] Come on! How'd you feel killing a man? [siren wailing] - Oh my god! Go!
