MONSTROUSLY FORBIDDEN DREAMS I'm the first! So they don't steal it. Ah! Stop! Good morning, I fell. One moment, I'll put everything in place. Be patient. Now I'll put everything in order. I'm handy with these things. I will answer for everything. Did you see how I fell? Goodbye. Good morning. Excuse me. Holy shit! It always happens to me! Ouch! Stop! I'm late. There is another one. Good morning. Attention, paycheck delivery on the second floor. Correction, paycheck delivery on the ground floor. I have to go up. - Allow me. - Allow me. Give me a hand. Excuse me. I put two points. I'll go get a needle and thread. I'll take advantage of it because the lift is open! A needle and thread! - Ah! - Coniglio, it's Franchini. - Excuse me. I didn't recognize you. - After so many years you're still scary. - Have you finished the Bear series? - I have to suffer here for others 12 weeks. - Is that your job! Excuse me... I need to bring these two dogs to the comics editorial office. - At the end of the corridor. - Thank you. - Are they dangerous? - Forget about it! - Are you still at Dalia's comics? - Yes. - I was hoping you'd switch to the Bear. Forget about it! I've never thought about it. I don't really like this job but living Dalia's stories... ..so sweet, so beautiful, it's like living a dream. And by dreaming you manage to save yourself. - Franchini, we're waiting for you for the photos. - I'll be right there. Hello. - Yes, he called me! - Good morning, ladies. - Really? Good morning. Good morning everyone. Hello, Superman. Thank you. Today I'm letting you keep this. Let's start. Why don't you look at me, Mandrake? I'm sending you to the Wolf Man! I'm sending you to the Wolf Man! - The sketches have arrived. - Excuse me, I didn't want to touch her. - She likes? Yes. What I would do to her! Mamma Mia! Pretty! Come with me, I'll open you like an apple! - Stop it! - You understand! I haven't even touched her sister! Ruin the drawing! Excuse me, Dalia. We get right to work. Dahlia and Superman. "Once again..." "..the beautiful..." "..Dahlia..." "..was in mortal danger." "I will not bow to your blackmail! I won't say a word!" "Superman, save me!" Fly! Fly! Faster than light! "Thanks to his superpowers Superman flew over the city. "Suddenly with his supervision he sees Dalia in danger." We want two million dollars and a car to the airport. Otherwise we will detonate the bomb and we will kill the hostages. Superman, help! - My love! - Thank you, Superman, my hero! But it's not Dalia! Leave me! There is an mistake. Go down! A kiss, my hero! Dahlia! Coniglio, what are you doing up there! I was freshening up my ideas. Get him down. Be careful. - Hold on. - Always dreaming with head in the clouds! - Thank you. The translations had to be ready by noon. Do you know what time it is? - I do not know. - He does not know. It's time fire you! With your stupidity and your inefficiency you have damaged Dalia... ..our best-selling comic. I'm transferring him to the Wolf Man! No! Not the Wolf Man! - Director, Dalia? All my life. - Get to work! - Yes! Don't judge me wrong! - Help! - Where are we? - Let's go away! I want to go back home. Fuck you. Every time I enter the house the jokes on me! - Hi Marina. - You are late! - I had to work overtime. What's up? Ah! Excuse me. He stole my shoe. Wait... I'll clean everything and put it in my pocket. So it's all right. Good evening, ma'am. She doesn't say hello. Ah! He was at the entrance and now he is here already. - You work too much, you neglect me. - That's not true! Always late like my fourth husband that died early. - How? - Under a truck. - Mamma, Paolo... - He's comfortable! - We are already on the third Martini. - Mamma... - Don't call me that! - Doctor... - All right, he'll tell us later. Now go and change. You know what I mean, right? No bad figures. I'm at dinner with the Raspanti Pereboni of the Pereboni. - I'll try to give my best! - God help us! - Come on, Marina. - Hello. Raspanti Pereboni dei Pereboni. - The key. Thank you. But she wasn't... No. Great. She seemed to me ... all right. He just... Gi? gave me the key... Hello, big dog. Crap... Come out of there. Good evening, Miss Dalia... ..Sorry for the delay. I stayed at the office. How was your day? Good? "She was a prisoner of a spell..." "..and she's been waiting for years for a brave knight..." "..to release her from her captivity." "On the enchanted lake, after years went by looking for Excalibur..." "..and of the beautiful Princess Dalia, Percival finally arrived..." "..The Knight more beautiful and brave..." "..than ever had crossed those mysterious woods." Water! Holy Merlin! Wonderful! How peaceful! My brave knight! - I hear a voice. - This way. - Who speaks to me? - I, my handsome knight. - A frog that talks! - I'm under a spell. I will go back to being Dalia, the woman of your dreams and you will find Excalibur... ..if you kiss me on the mouth. - On the mouth? - Yes. You will not regret it, my handsome knight. Are you sure? On the mouth? OK. Paolo, my hero, I will give you Excalibur. You broke the spell, I will be yours forever. Come to me! Princess Dalia, I have found you! Here I am, I'm coming. Aaah! - Excuse me, Countess Pereboni, Paolo will come soon. - It does not matter. - Where is he? - I do not know. He's always late like your poor dad that drowned. We will start soon. - Manuel, some water, please. - Water. Good morning love. Love! What love? Can't you see hes not there? - He's already gone. - He doesn't dare do the review, after yesterday's disaster. Messy and cowardly, like my second husband, killed by disease. -He thinks only of comics. -It's his job, Mamma! Now who goes to the supermarket and the bank to cash a check? Ugh! Mam... Doctor... ...I'll go, no problem. But... it's Dalia! She is here! And she! - Get out of the way! - Excuse me. Dahlia! So it's true! Now I'll explain, miss. I've been going on for four or five years dreaming of you, instead your not a dream! - I was looking for you, love. - You are welcome? - Come love. What she said? Miss Dalia, is not teasing me, is she? I have a feeling that this is also not reality... ...but the usual dream. Can you assure me it's true? I would also like to kindly point out that I only have 30,000 lire. I do not know if... I'm on a budget... ..and I see a lot of canned goods which I didn't budget for. I know all about her. She had this band in "Dahlia at the Zambezi Falls." She can't remember it, because every week... Ah! - Love... - 499,020 lire. - How much? - 499,020 lire. Even the 20 lire? I only have 30,000 lire. All this stuff... I don't drink... I have a small reserve. With all these bad people, around I stash the money... What? No... What are you looking at? I have the... the money. - Dahlia! - Excuse me, I had to put the chocolates back. If you want, I'll help you. Dahlia... How beautiful! You can't understand it! It's like me. I've known her forever. I am her personal translator... - You kissed her! - Her? I understand, she is your wife. -Is she you girlfriend? - No! -Is she your cousin? -Is she your daughter? - Asshole, no jokes. - I'm not joking. Tell us where she went. Wait! I am willing to marry her! Counselor, it was no joke. I was terrified! I understand. But the only chance to prove your estrangement... ..to the murder of Roberti was that microfilm accusing Fonseca. You shouldn't have exposed yourself. If men had found it was Fonseca, it would have been worse. - Perhaps it is true. - I can get it back and prove my innocence. The man from the supermarket had the car from the Nosferatu hotel. Even Fonseca's men saw that car. Those are people don't stop at anything. We must stop them. I'll go right away. Enough with the imprudence. His position is already compromised. You stay calm and leave it to me. I can be trusted. Thank you, counselor. I will not forget what you're doing for me. To beat Fonseca and his gang would be a great satisfaction. - I consider it a duty. Don't worry. - Thank you. - You heard? - Yes. - That microfilm must be ours. - At all costs? - Yes. - I'll handle it. Counsel, I'll pass you the number you asked for. Hello. Is this Fonseca? I'm Bauer. Forget the pleasantries. She tried to go over me and recover the evidence without me. It will cost her dearly! He must give me 50 million more. Don't take any other initiative! The proof is in the hands of one man. A trusted professional. My God! Is anybody here to give us the keys? - Good morning. - Paolo! - Meet our new guests. - Guests? - Very pleased. - Pleasure. - Haven't we met before? - No! - This morning at the supermarket. She was with you ... - With whom? - With the supermarket cart. Marina! - Then let's do the math! - Marina, what did you hear? Ah! The gentlemen want to ask me some questions? - The girl you kissed today... - Dahlia? - Ah! The ears! For pity's sake, don't say anything to Marina. She's very jealous, we are to get married in a week. - She is capable of killing me. - Me too! Me too? Good morning! What can we do so that this doesn't happen? I will forget everything if you give me what the girl gave you. Be patient... I've never done that with a man. I have kind of a cultural barrier. All right, I will. I have little saliva. It's the same? Can he close his eyes, please? Here I am to her. On her mouth. - See you. - Until we meet again. Then I explain them. Her brother seems to me a bit ... No? Is exactly... He has this vice. Where are we going? - No. - What? Very good. This program. Very interesting. "In the mysterious jungle Dahlia was a prisoner of art dealers." "Only a man could take her away from her atrocious fate." - Aaaah! - Tarzan! Aaaah! Help! Help! Tarzan! What? They're just incisors. - Paolo! - Dalia, here I am! - What are you doing? - I'll take off this door and come back. - Here we go again! - So I'm going to watch this program. Very comfortably. There you are. Paolo, do you love me? Yes, I've always loved you. - Swear to me. - I swear. Give me a kiss and we won't talk about it anymore. Come in. Who is knocking? What a day! Luckily I'm going to bed now. I will rest. Now a good night's sleep. What time is it? Who is? Yet he? It wasn't enough for him? A knife? What happened? My God! He's cold! A dead corpse! Ma'am, there's a dead body on the bed! She doesn't care. There's a body... Police! Hello, police? This is the Nosferatu guesthouse. In my room there is a mo... I surrender, Mr. Scarred. Ouch! Very heavy metal! Paolo! Dahlia! Then it is true that you are true! Give me a kiss. I want to give you a kiss. I do not have the courage to open my eyes. I love you! Ah! - Who is? I was about to give him a kiss. -He's a friend, don't worry. Very pleased. He doesn't shake hands. - Excuse me about the dress... - It doesn't matter, let's leave right away. - I came to get the sweets. - Which? - Those from the supermarket... - Speaking of which! - Your husband Ba... - My husband? I'm not married. His brother kissed my mouth... - There not brothers. - So who were those two bad guys? The one with the scar and that fat guy I found dead... Was he really dead? - "Most dead". - Good! - Good? - He has the chocolates? - Yes... - They are important to me. Really? I too am greedy. We have something in common. - When I was a child my grandmother... - We don't care! - My grandmother... - We don't care! - OK. - Give us those chocolates. - All right. Wait here. I think they are in the car. I called the police. When they arrive, explain who the dead man in the room is. I come back, I come and go. Police? In here you can never find a thing! Holy shit! Thanks, shine it here. - Here. - We're from the police. They called us about a crime. - It was me. - You committed the crime? - No, it was Marina. - Are you the killer? No, Marina. She ate the chocolates. She is very greedy. She has those teeth... I'll will explain. I don't understand, they were here. I want to explain the situation... Where is that mouse? Excuse me! I will release it. Excuse me. I closed it because I didn't see that... I was convinced that the box of chocolates... - You called for a crime, not for a theft of chocolates. - Watch out! He lights up and I put my foot... Take a note. Nosferatu Grand Hotel. It's 24:05... He has seen me? Every time... Wait for me to remove my foot. Commissioner, don't look at me like I'm crazy... ..I have witnesses. Here they are. Dalia and her friend. You write. They asked me for chocolates. - Who? - Their... Wait. Come, commissioner. - Marina took... - Who is Dalia? I met her in the gardens with Merlin the wizard. It's the history of comics. It's the one that this morning... ..at the supermarket she stole the chocolates. You don't believe me, do you, Inspector? Be careful! Careful. It bites me. In the meantime, write. Let's check. Let's check. I'll show you. I don't look at him because it scares me. Look on the bed. Now what does that say? - What does that say? - What does that say? - What? - Look. Who is that... I'm not sick! - There was a corpse with a knife and blood... - All right. Write. He was at the supermarket and I kissed his cousin in the Orinoco Basin. Where? He wanted to kiss me. - On the mouth. - This is crazy. - I have a hunch. I have a feeling that rat who works with him is an ass... Let's go. You have reversed and I said stro... Where? Commissioner, the motive for the crime it is to be found in chocolates. What crime? What the hell did he say? He shut up! Yet there was! What a problem I have! Go to hell! Holy shit! Another! Wait up. So don't run away! Ma'am, there's another dead... Commissioner, there is another body. Commissioner! Stop! There is another dead. You don't believe me, commissioner. If it's not true, arrest me. I'm starting to wonder. Come, commissioner. How do we deal with this dead man? What...? - There was a toad... - Enough, please! - Read it again. - Yes. "The wife, that is, perhaps his sister..." "..the fianc?e of the first deceased who escaped..." "I swear I didn't know that she was married." "She kissed me at the supermarket because when I met her..." "..At the enchanted lake she was a toad, then..." - "A spell has transformed her into a woman."- He teases us? - I would never allow myself. - Then answer in kind! You have to tell me the name, the surname ... ...date of birth, who is this Dahlia... ...what about the chocolates, the name of the alleged first dead... ..and that of the presumed second dead! Answer! Cheers! You are about to hear the questions of the year. The questions of the century! In a few moments we will have the moment that we have all been waiting so long for. Let's introduce our contestant. Here is our nice hostess. Dalia, introduce Paolo Coniglio. Let's give him a round of applause. We have with us the champion of champions! He will become the biggest contestant of history. - Let me shake your hand. - Thank you. - It's nice to meet you! - I know you are reaping laurels everywhere. - Yes. - You receive letters from admirers.

Nicknamed Carcamanho, Mr. Mike. - So? - What? But... - What do you want? - Out! Don't ever let me see you again! Kick him out! Why me! - You are welcome. - Thank you. You realize that you're talking about fate? If Mamma knew... ... she would not give us consent for the wedding. - I know but... - Because you said that in the hotel there were two corpses? - But... I understand you have your head in the clouds and are always dreaming... ...but I don't understand why. - Let's go home. Maybe you are not happy with how you live. Paolo, were in love. We are getting married in two days and we will live happily. Me, you and mamma. And mamma! Wait! It's very dangerous. Give me your hand. Trust me blind man. Excuse me ... your ... I'll put it here. Where are you going, Pongo? Come here. You're good. Don't walk away. - I have to go to the comics department. - On the second floor. - The bear! He's afraid? No, I have a wonderful relationship with dogs. Hello, Franchini, how are you? Come on, Franchini, stop it! Franchini! Ouch! No! Ouch! Franchini, you stink! You have completely changed attitude. What happened? Sometimes judgments about people are wrong. Dalia and the champion. This Dahlia She just "screws" them all! The young lady is doing a series... This the... All? With all? "Under the center court sun in red earth..." "..Paolo Coniglio played a dramatic match with his rival..." "..To win the trophy and love of the beautiful Dahlia." 99 to 99. A Japanese-type tiebreaker... ...Swedish champion Bord and outsider Paolo Coniglio. It is the eighteenth hour of the longest game in history. Coniglio is nipping the resistance of the Swedish champion. Here's a top spin from Bord. Coniglio replies backwards. Another lob of Coniglio. Match point. The Swede is ready. The ball goes beyond the stands! Bord is again champion of Rome. Coniglio leaves the field and he goes towards the changing rooms. Condolence. Until we meet again. Allow me. Allow me. Excuse me. Out of the way! Condolences again. We are at the moment of the awards ceremony. Princess Dalia is going to hand the cup to the winner... ..the Swedish Bord. But what happened? The ball is in the field. Coniglio is returning to the field. Then he is the winner! Dahlia, Victory! Excuse me... Ah! Mr. Director... I would like... Done. Wait. I will clean you up in seconds. Done. Here you are. The card stays stuck because of the glue. Ah! I will clean it. Here you are. It got a little dirty. I was dreaming. As usual! You must understand that we don't pay you to dream. Dalia is not a real creature, she is a comic, she does not exist! Hello. - It's Dalia. -Are you kidding me? - No. - I'm transferring you to the Wolf Man. - What? - Paolo, can you hear me? - Yes, sorry. - Can you hear me well? - Yes, very good. Luckily! You must hurry, and bring me the box of chocolates. - What chocolates? - What? - Yes, of course! Let's meet in front at the Opera house after work. Please, be careful. And don't forget the chocolates. Yes. Dalia, I would like to tell you that... .. I love you. I love you! - I will be right back. - Hurry up. - Mr. blind! - Who is it? - It's me. I will help you cross. - I don't want to cross. - Paolo! - I'm crossing... - There was a blind man... - Paolo! Excuse me, miss, I can never get this blind man across. - As agreed, I brought the chocolates. - Thank you. They are here! We must run away or they'll kill us! - Let's go there. - How do you know? It's like in "Dalia and the Ghost of the Stage". Here. To the dressing rooms. Here we are. - Get out of here! - I know... - Go away! - Have mercy! - You can't stay here. - I know but... ..it's a long story, I'm being chased by two bad guys... - Hey! - One moment. Let's make peace. Allow me. What happened? Come here! I'll make you do a nice ballet. - Ouch! - Shhh! - Excuse me. - Go away! - I go. - There is... - Over there! There? Go away. - What do I have to do? - You dance. Good morning. What do I do? - Do I go behind? - Yes! Pull her up! Do I collect her? Get out of here! - Ah! The walnuts! - Shut up! All right! Aaah! Sorry. I'm a rookie, I'm not practiced. Excuse me. I am responsible for all damages. I will pay for everything. Go away! Go away! Go up! Go up! Thank you. He saw? That moron isn't here yet. The guests will arrive shortly. - I'm worried, maybe something happened to him. - Perhaps! - Mamma! - When you choose a husband like that... - It's just the first. I hope with the others you will do better. - You're being unfair. - He's shy, good, kind... - More flowers, ma'am. Yesterday he brought you some chocolates and he didn't have the courage to give them to you. Of course, I have diabetes! I don't eat sweets. Manuel... - 22, Relatives. - commissioner, we have one. - Let him in. - 23? - Spaniards. - 24, Vandini. - Good morning. - 25, Sallustri. - Look at the parcel? You too seem busy to me. - Commissioner... Commissioner! - Yes? - There would be... I have had a series of... I need intensive care. Please book me a room in a trusted clinic. Good! Nobody noticed, I screwed them all! Very pleased. My name is Coniglio. - How will you dress? - For the occasion I have a classic suit. - Everyone wants to meet you. - They've already met him! Mamm... Doctor... Excuse me. Allow me. - Paolo... - Yes, Miss Dalia? And she? Yes. Turn on the light. I turned off the light because it seemed to me that you were scantily clad. I took off my clothes to let them dry. - Do you have something to cover me with? - Yes, but wait for me there. I will give you my shirt. Here it is. I hope it fits well also in color. You must excuse me if you always see me unusually dressed. - Do you wonder why I came back. - No, but tell me. Because I need that box of chocolates. Another one? Have you already finished the one I gave you in the theater? You have a hell of an appetite for chocolates. - How many do you eat per day? - No, I want the supermarket box. Those chocolates are very important to me. Sorry, I'm not used to you. Do you want that? I saw it in the living room. I'll go get it. You wait here. It's best that you hide. I have a very special situation. - Come. - My clothes. - It's true. They are wet. Come, hide in here. It's too small. It's is good for clothes. - The? - You can't fit in a drawer. - Could you ... - In the closet? - Right. Here you are. - You had an extraordinary idea. - Hurry up. I go and will come back. Dalia, can you hear me? She doesn't hear me. Miss, I would like to take advantage of this favorable situation... ..to express the following to you. From 114 episodes... ..I want to ask you this question: It really bothers me a lot... ..if someone loves? - Paolo, are you talking to yourself? Yes. I speak to myself because I'm alone. When one is alone he speaks for himself. - If one is alone... - You are still in that costume? I had to comb my hair. Wait! - What are you doing? - I'll put the dress in the closet. - I'm wearing it tonight. - It's the dress for the wedding. - What wedding? - You have forgot we are get married on saturday? Yes! But it's better not to talk about it. - I became... - I'm going, They're waiting for us. - In the meantime, I'll put this in the closet. - Hurry up. - Dahlia? - The chocolates? - It's crazy! Tell me the truth. Sometimes She comes to see me because... - Not now! I have to get back those chocolates. - OK. Inside one of them is a microfilm of vital importance. - What film is it? Maybe I saw it. - No, it's a microfilm. Without that they can blame me of a crime I did not commit. - Oh no! - Now you understand? - Yes. - Mamma Mia! - Now go, please. - All right. - What are you doing, imbecile? - I was kissing. - I'm training for the marriage. - Hurry up. All right. Then I will stop exercising. As you want. Whose are these? Well... they're mine. - My third husband was a homosexual. - Really? But he had better taste. - Now get dressed. They are waiting for you. - All right. Etchoo! Etchoo! I got something in my nose. - Hurry up! - Ma'am, I don't wear panties, that would be excessive. Allow me. I apologize. Allow me... Excuse me. There it is. No! No thank you. Listen... allow me? Here you are. Allow me. I apologize. Allow me. - Taste the cocktail. - No, thanks, I've had enough. The watch is underwater. I'm in a difficult moment of my life. I'll explain later. - Allow me, I have to go out. - That way! I'm really happy that you are back in possession... ..of the box. You threw it! With this microfilm you saved my life. Thank you. I will take advantage of having you here in the car alone with me... ..to tell you that I love you... If you hadn't found it, I would have been unjustly convicted. You realize that I have a... A man like Fonseca can only be nailed with certain evidence. He's beyond suspicion, no one would think he's a mobster. Here we are. - Here you are. - Thank you. - Not at all. - We might not see each other again. Really? You had to give me... She goes away? Wait, I'll take you. - I'll handle that. - The car belongs to my mother-in-law. In case of danger I will shield you with my body. Dalia, I love you... Wait for me here. In case of danger intervene firmly and decisively. Firmly and decisively! Firmly and decisively! Counselor, I have proof. Aaah! - Dalia, I'm coming! I apologize. - Quick, let's go away, they killed Bauer. - Really? - Yes. Do not worry, You're in no danger with me! Come with us, quick! No! - Help! Leave me! - Don't make a fuss! Wait! Dalia, try to throw yourself out! Believe me, it's just like in "Dahlia and the Monster of the Amazon". The Monster of the Amazon? I mean... you want to drive me crazy! - No... - Liar! Like my poor third husband. Why have the corpses not been found? Speak! Leave it to us, ma'am, please. If you will allow, I prefer to answer to Mr... This Fonseca, who would he have killed? Confess! Tell the commissioner you invented everything. - It is not true. - No? - No. - Dare you contradict me? - No. - Dare to say your not a liar? - Always a dream, inventing everything. - Now stop! - I ask the questions! - All right. Where is Fonseca's body? - No, commissioner! - Leave it alone! - Excuse me. The first dead has disappeared. the second also. Then counselor Bauer that died and vanished. Now he tells me that engineer Fonseca is a killer! He's absurd! I'll light it. Don't look at me like that, it's the truth. They want to kill Dalia. She has proof of the murder of Fonseca. He is Spanish. - He's the killer. - I don't understand. Why bother good people... ..for the follies of a visionary! - Mamma... - Shut up, do you want to marry him! Do you understand what kind of life I have? - Engineer Fonseca, you deny knowing this man? - Of course. - Ma'am, leave it to me. - I deny, commissioner. I've never seen him and I have never heard of this Dalia. - Nor the counselor... - Bauer. - Thank you. I don't know what I have to do with this story, but I returned today from the Antilles today. The undersecretary was with me Vincenzi-Rubini... ..the Honorable Gatti-Mignanelli and all the Italian delegation... ..for foreign trade. Do you want to check? - It's not necessary. - It will be a question of a case of the same name. - The unconscious! - He mentioned his name and ... - Everyone can be wrong. I apologize infinitely. Thank you. Goodbye. - Greetings. - Ma'am... Until we meet again. Then, engineer, I would give you the hand that... He doesn't shake my hand. They don't shake my hand anymore. - It went well. - For the moment yes, but if the girl doesn't talk... She will talk. We will have to warn counselor Bauer's men. - Did he come over to our side? -Yes, he had 50 million. - Good. Coniglio will also take them to Bauer. He looks like someone who doesn't give up.
