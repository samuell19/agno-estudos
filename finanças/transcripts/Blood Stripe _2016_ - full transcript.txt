Anything you need, this stuff will remove. We call it the miracle because it gets out the toughest stain with just a little bit of water. Just add water to this brush, brush it for three seconds. (lawnmower rumbling) - [Barb] Hey, can you take Rusty to his doctor's appointment tomorrow? - Uh, yeah, why? - [Barb] For his shots. Is that okay? - Oh yeah, yep, I got it. - Anyway, I'm just one team member away and I hope to god I can get Carol Swanson on there, remember her? She sells craft supply, put me right over the top.

Can you cut some of those for me? - Yeah. - I need 'em for the house. Hey girl, don't drown 'em. (upbeat rock music) Okay so Lex has got the coals going and Carol's picking up the cake they got. Hey, can you put that wine in the fridge for me? - Yeah, yeah. - I'm gonna get started on this potato salad. - Okay. - Ah crap. (doorbell ringing) Russ can you get that?

You look fantastic, honey. - Thank you. - I bet Rusty missed you. - I hope so. Yeah, sorry. - Hey Carol, you wanna put that outside for me. Thank you so much. - And I bet you're ready to start that family now. - Almost, yeah almost, just got home. - [Carol] 10 pounds, 11 ounces. - Wow. That is a huge baby, you think she's okay?

(loud thudding) - [Barb] Troy, Troy! - Get off of me. - Come here, come here. - Get off of me! Get off of me! - Good aim, right? The guy who did it was one of my regulars. Said he just got sick and tired of looking at it. Want another one, Nick? (door creaking) - Next time you decide to go out and get shit faced, don't take my truck. - [Sergeant] I'm not shit faced. - Took you five minutes to get in the door. - What, were you timing me? - No. I just didn't feel like helping you. - Thanks a lot, Russ. Going to bed. - [Rusty] Oh, you're sleeping in our bed tonight? - Yeah. Where else would I sleep? - I dunno. Every time I wake up, you're never there. There's a brat in the fridge, you hungry? - No I'm not, thanks. - Right, 'cause you don't eat. You don't sleep. You just beat the shit out of people and run off. - Oh please, that guy's a fucking asshole. - [Rusty] That guy. - And I barely touched him. - That guy was a guest at your welcome home party. Who's the asshole? - He put his hands on me, Russ. He put his fucking hands all over me. - Okay so what? So you bash his head in and disappear and leave me to clean up your mess? - I'm so sorry. I'm sorry you had to clean up my mess. - [Rusty] Oh watch it. - I'm real, oh I'm real fucking sorry about that, Rusty. And I'm real fucking sorry that, that fucking asshole. - Hey watch yourself. - Put his fucking hands all over me and you don't give a shit. I'm fucking sorry about that. Real fucking sorry. - I think you need a good night's sleep. - I can't, I can't sleep. God dammit. (coughing) Dammit. Ah, my stomach's worth shit. Ah.

Rusty. - Shh. - I think we need to get you to the VA. - There's a wait. - Okay, how long? - 129 days.

Hey, but the vest back on. (water trickling) - [TV Salesman] The toughest stains you've got, bring 'em on. This is why we call this stuff the miracle, it's the answer to all your problems.

(calm piano music) - [Radio] And the first mosquito bite should be experienced. Word of that got around town quickly. Clarence Bunson was looking out his back window and he saw Mrs. Rasmussen hanging up the sheets on the clothes line. - Need a hand? - Sure. (cheerful music) - And after that, the court side cabins need to be scrubbed down real good. That's where the little ones stay, lots of bed wetters, so half the mattresses are heading for the dump. Oh and I hope you're good with an ax because Carl's useless with his back. And we need to restack the wood piles for the fire in the saunas. - Got it. - Okay. Not much of a vacation for ya, huh? - No, it's good, I like the work. - Okay, so here's your cabin. - Thank you. - Don't thank me, you haven't seen it yet. Oh and I thought you could use some things out of here. - Uh, what is it? - That's the lost and found. - Oh. Thanks Dorothy. - Okay. And people call me, Dot. Okay? - Yeah it's Rusty - [Sergeant] Hey it's me. - Hey, are you okay? - Yeah, I'm good. I'm feeling real good. - Okay where are you, where are you calling from? - I'm at camp. I found the camp I went to when I was little. It's right on a lake just south of the border. - I called the police. I called all the hospitals. - Oh, I'm sorry. I guess I just lost track of time. I was just driving. - [Rusty] Okay, okay, where are you? Barb and I will come get you. - No, um, there's a lot to do here and Dot wants me to stay. The camp's out of session now and there's a lot to do before the winter so, I'm gonna stay here for a couple weeks and help her out. - Who the hell is Dot? - [Sergeant] She runs the place, she's in charge. - Okay honey, you just got home. Alright, you have a job here, a good job. What am I supposed to tell Frondoor? - Oh yeah, I didn't like that job. - [Rusty] What? - I didn't like that job, there was nothing for me to do. - [Rusty] Oh Jesus Christ. - [Sergeant] Russ. - I don't understand. - A couple days and I'll be home, okay? Love you. - I brought you a blanket. It gets pretty cold at night. I'll just leave it here then. I'm Carl. - Okay, here's directions to the dump. Hustle back, I got a retreat coming in three days. - There's people coming? (upbeat rock music) (serene music) - Here, have another. - Oh thank you, yeah. Sorry, I can eat. - No, no, no, there's nothing to be sorry about. You're a hard worker. You're the hardest worker I've had up here, you don't stop. - We used to say nobody every drowned in sweat, so. - We? Who's we? - The Corps, Marine Corps. - The Marine Corps? A girl Marine, I didn't know that they had those. - Yep, they do. - So, what do I call you? - Marine, I mean I'm a Sergeant. - Sergeant. - You don't have to call me that. - No, I like that, I like that. - Okay. - So uh, what'd you do over there? - Lots of things. - Like? - In Iraq I was a lioness. - Lioness, what's that? - We were female troops attached to combat units. And then in Afghanistan I was part of an FET. We were assigned to checkpoints and there to support civil affairs and clearing operations. - How'd you get that job? - I volunteered. - What'd you do everyday, day to day. - Checkpoints by day, house raids by night. Pretty much. - I uh, I was given a rifle when I was six. I used to shoot squirrels and wood chucks in the back yard. - I got mine when I was seven. - Yeah, my uncle. So there's people coming? - Oh yeah, it's like eight, 10, 12. Church retreat, minister likes to bring up a few folks from the board. Last year I was overrun. Oh, that reminds me, I need you to pick up some fish for me tomorrow. Carl usually comes up short on the walleye and you know how to drive a boat, right? - Yeah. - Good. Alright, enough chit chat, we gotta get back to it, okay? You know it's an honor to have you here on the camp, lioness sergeant. You're damn strong. (boat motor rumbling) - How are you doing? - Hi. Uh, I came for the walleye. - Yeah, well, lake's got plenty of 'em. Need a guide? - Oh, no, no, I'm here for Dot, for the camp. - Oh, for the retreat, right? - Yeah. - Hold on a second, I'll gram 'em for ya. - Okay, thank you. - I'll be right back, Jeremy. - [Jeremy] Yeah. - Here are your fish. Got something? - Uh, maybe. No. Got away. - Oh well, live to fight another day, right? - Yeah. Thank you. - You bet. And uh, tell Dot we got plenty more where that came from, alright? - Okay, thanks. - Yep. (boat motor rumbling) - There you are. Come on and meet these folks, help with the bags. That's our sarge. (saw rumbling) (phone ringing) - God dammit. This is Rusty, leave a message, I'll get back to you. - Grab a refill on that rice, would ya? - Yes ma'am. - Is that enough for ya Earl? - Oh Dot, you know I can never get enough of what you're serving. - Well you'll have to settle for the walleye tonight. - If you say so. - Dot, my dear, I hope I am the last in line. - And Art, why is that? - Because I am going to take all that is left. - I know you enjoy the fish dinner, Art. - Like coming home. Ah, you must be Dot's lioness. You keeping her in line? - Yes sir. - [Art] How'd you come to find us? - I went to camp here one summer. - Oh, must've been before my time. I'd remember that red hair, yes I would. - Well that's why I hired her, you know. - We give thanks for being. We give thanks for being here. We give thanks for being here together. Amen. Now you newcomers consider yourselves warned. Tonight, you will be subjected to a literal trial by fire in the hottest sauna in the Northwoods. Surviving it is a traditional rite of passage. Those who haven't been able to withstand the heat have never been seen again. Now I have been waiting for this all year. Dig in. (people chattering) Let's have a hand for Dot, she has outdone herself. (applauding) Now I have a special treat for you, I have asked our oldest living board member to give us this evening's meditation. Take it away, Earl. - Thanks Art. And Art also forgot to mention that the best part of your sauna experience is gonna be when you run down to the lake and jump in. This is a poem called Fisherman Stony Point. "Here's an old guy talking to himself. "He reels in his bait and says, "son you've got to go out there again. "I know the rocks are treacherous, the water is deep, "the winds can come up suddenly "and there's no more than the thinnest line ties you to me. "This is the way your life is going to be. "Out and back, again and again, partly in this world, "partly in the other and never at home in either. "Still it's what you were born to do. "You are young and strong, all steel and hooks. "You know I'll do everything I can to bring you back safely. "Go out there boy and bring home "a big fish for your old father to eat." There you go Art, catch 'em. - Yes, yes. Thank you, thank you, Earl. Hey, hi. Sit, sit, sit. (serene guitar music) (people shouting) - I can't see him yet. You know I haven't seen him since his birthday in February. - But the hearing's coming up, right? - Yeah, end of September. - You know I'll be there. - Thanks, Art. - You got money in your pocket? - I got enough. - Going to meetings? - Sometimes. When I'm struggling. You know what I mean? - Yes. (sighing) - Couple more paddles. - [Barb] It is a perfect day. - [Sergeant] So what's next? - I'm good 'til dinner. Go out on the lake. I'm gonna get more stuff. - How are you doing? - Good. Hey. - There you go. - Thanks. - My son would love it out here. I oughta bring him out, teach him how to fish. - Yeah, how old is he? - He's eight. - Yeah, that's a good age to learn. That's about when I learned. - You got kids? - Nope. Don't have the courage. - It's you and me, lioness. (calm music) (heavy breathing) (intense rock music) - What the fuck are you looking at!? (intense rock music) - I fixed that latch. (gasping) I saw your door wasn't closing properly, so I put that good latch on there for you. Wish me luck. (boat motor rumbling) (loud thudding) (grunting) - Hey, do you need a hand? - Um, no thanks, I got it. - Are you taking it out? - Um, no, it's for the retreat. - There's a uh, there's an eagles nest up in that red pine up there. You see that? - Oh yeah. - Keep an eye out. - Will do. - Ah, this is the day the Lord hath made. Let us rejoice and be glad in it. And you, my trusty guide, shall we set forth to see what bounty the lake has to offer today? - Where's your rod, Art? - Oh, oh, oh shit. - I got one, don't worry. - Ah ha ha. Will you join us? - Um, no I have too much to do here, gotta help Dot. - So be it, our loss. Be not deceived by calm exteriors, beneath this placid surface lie depths teaming with life and we too know the dark and secret ways which we will plumb in spite of weeds.
