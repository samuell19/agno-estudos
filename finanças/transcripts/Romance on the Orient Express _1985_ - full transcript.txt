[triumphant music] [sweeping romantic music] [birds call] [water laps] [bird wings flap] [speaking foreign language] - Oh, what did the guy say? - I don't think I wanna know. I'm glad my French is better than my Italian. - What Italian? - Oh, very funny. - It's over there, c'mon. [footsteps click] - [Station Announcement] The special train, Orient Express, direct to Paris and London is now boarding at Platform Two. [man speaking foreign language] [speaking foreign language] - Hi. - May I see your tickets please? - Here we are. - Merci, and welcome to Orient Express. Julian. - Right ladies, if you care to follow me. Here we are, ladies, you'll be in this car, the Julian. Favorite carriage of Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, and the present queen, of course. - [Station Announcement] Orient Express, [speaking foreign language]. The special train, Orient Express, direct to Paris and London is now-- - Here we are, Miss Parker, and Miss Lawson, you'll be right next door. Please let any of us know if there's anything you want, anything at all. - I'm gonna go change. - Okay, listen now, why don't you get settled, and then come and get me, we'll go have some lunch. - Okay. [door closes] - [Station Announcement] [speaking foreign language] Orient Express [speaking foreign language]. Final call for boarding of the Orient Express [flips] to Paris and London at Platform Two. [footsteps click] [people chatter] - Oui, Madame. [speaking foreign language] [speaking foreign language] - Scusi. - How may I help you? - Well actually, I need some help in locating someone. I'd like to surprise this person on the train, but I must know for sure that she is on the train. - I am so sorry, Monsieur, but it against the policy. - Ah, but this is a special occasion. You see, it's my mother I'm looking for, it's her birthday. I was to meet her in Paris, but, I was able to get away sooner, and I would so like to surprise her. [bill slides] - Monsieur, voila. - [Alex] Thank you. - Madame, [speaking foreign language]. Oui, monsieur. [speaking foreign language] [joyful music] [whistle blows] - [Conductor] All aboard. [thuds] - Porter. Thank you. [whistle blows] [train wheels roll] [knocks] - Come in. [door opens] [door closes] - Well, what do you think? - It's fabulous. These cars are so beautiful. - Cabins, my dear. Or carriages. [clicks] Remember the, uh, Queen mums slept here. - Oh yes. - It's a little too much for me, I've got to tell you. I mean, what is a girl like me doing on the Orient Express? - I hope I haven't made a mistake. - What do you mean? - Oh, it's just so extravagant. We could have been in Paris in two hours by plane. - Lily, we're supposed to be on our vacation, and it's not every day you're made managing editor of a major magazine. And if it's good enough for the Queen mother, honey, it's good enough for you. [laughs] Besides, all work and no play makes Jill a very dull girl. - Yes, yes, I know, but this Jill is a lot happier working than playing. - Lily. The train has hardly left the station, will you lighten up? - Okay, okay, I'll try. - Besides, I think trains are very romantic. - Oh you do, do you? - If you ask me, we could both use a little romance in our lives. [sweeping romantic music] [door opens] [clicks] [glass settles] [train tracks rattle] [dreamy magical music] [door opens] - Ah, excuse me, we were wondering, are those seats taken? - Nobody's sitting there. - Great. - Lily. [snaps] Hello. - Oh. [laughs] I'm sorry, I was just thinking about the last time I was on a train. - [Susan] Must have been some trip. Recently? - Lifetime ago. Oh no, no, no, don't take my picture. - No, come on, don't worry, it's not for the magazine, it's for my scrapbook. I've never been to Europe before, remember? Say cheese. - Cheese. [camera shutter clicks] Can we have lunch now? - Yeah, I'm starved. I cannot believe what I see walking toward me. - [Lily] What? - Oh, that incredibly good-looking man. Don't look. - You are from New York? - Me? New York, yes. I'm from New York. New York's a great place. Have you ever been to New York? - Ah, mi scusi, my English is not well. [chuckles] My name is Flavio Cassini. I am the, how do you say, the captain, or the boss, of the porters on the train. [chuckles] I am so happy that you are with us. If I can make you happy somehow, you tell me. Si? - [Susan] Si. - I see you. Ciao. - Ciao. - All right? - Gorgeous, the man is gorgeous. - One would think you just met Mr. Right. - I'm not looking for Mr. Right, I'm looking for Mr. Right Now. [laughs] - Susan, you are wonderful. - Now we just have to convince him of that. - This is from Captain Cassini with his best wishes. [liquid pours] - You do, of course, know what they say. Beware of men bearing gifts. - Are you kidding? I can't remember the last time a man gave me a gift, maybe my luck is changing. [liquid pours] Thank you. And would you thank Captain Cassini for us? - Certainly, madam. - Here's to our new jobs, and our old friendship. And to Captain Cassini. Cheers. [glasses clink] [door opens] [door closes] Are you all right? - Mmmm, trains just make me melancholy. - Well, you're the one that wanted to take a train. Do you miss Robert? - Hmm, now and then. I'll be seeing him soon enough. - [Susan] Is he meeting you in Paris? - No, I'm seeing him in London. - Well, have you decided whether you're gonna marry him or not? - Well, he's brought it up a couple of times, but I haven't said yes and I haven't said no. He'll probably want an answer when I get to London. - [Susan] And? - And, I don't know, I haven't decided. - You don't sound overly excited. - Well, it'll be nice, it's always nice to see Robert. - [Susan] Nice isn't sexy. - Sometimes it is. - [Susan] Not often. - [Lily] How do you know? - I used to date nice guys. - [Lily] Ah, and now? - Bad boys. [laughs] - I think that's a slight exaggeration. - Yeah. [laughs] No boy is more like it. [laughs] Oh. [dreamy, magical music] [chuckles] [muffled train tracks rattle] - My name's Alex. What are you reading? - The Magic Mountain. - Oh, a little light reading on your vacation. - Yeah. [chuckles] Well, it is a little heavy, but I'm enjoying it. - You must be an English major. - Why must I be an English major? - [Alex] Well, who else would be reading The Magic Mountain on a train journey in France? - Okay, Comparative Literature major. My name's Lily. - Sandy, meet Lily, the Comparative Literature major. - Hello Lily. - [Lily] Hi Sandy, this is my friend Stacey. - [Sandy] Hello Stacey. - Hi. [chuckles] - Would you like some wine? - I'd love some. - All right. - Excuse me. [train tracks rattle] [thumps] - [Women] Ooh! - They're so bumpy, aren't they? You, you don't mind, do you? - [Stacey] No, not at all. - Thank you. - Mmm. - Thank you. [chuckles] - Here you go. - Ah, well, where are you going? [wine pours] - Well, we haven't really made any definite plans. We just got on the first train that was heading south because we wanted to see the south of France. - Can I come with you? [coughs] [chuckles] - Mmmhmm, sure, why not? - I'm serious, I'd like to go to the south of France with you. Now, would that be all right? - I guess that would be all right. - Great. I'm jolly glad you said that because I realize that I have a lot to talk to you about, and we just wouldn't have enough time unless we go to the south of France together. - Mmm. Do you do this sort of thing often? - I've never done anything like this before in my life. Really. I'm surprising myself. [muffled train tracks rattle] - Mmm, that was good, are you gonna have coffee? - [Susan] No thanks, I'm gonna look around for a bit. You wanna come with me? - No, I don't think so, I think I'll just stay here for a while. - Who knows, I might even run into Captain Cassini. [chuckles] - Well, good luck. - See you later. - Harry, have some more coffee. Are you feeling all right, dear? - Oh yes, thank you, Beatrice, I'm fine. - I'm sorry, I just get scared sometimes. - Yes, I know, I know. So do I. But here we are, having a wonderful time, nothing can spoil it. - You're absolutely right. As usual. - [Harry] At 68, I should be right about these things. - You're 69, darling. - How do you know? - 'Cause I'm 65. - Oh. You're 66, you were 16 when I asked you to dance at that tea party your mother gave for you. I was 19, and you've been lying about your age ever since. - That's not true. You were 20, and you were very skinny and very fresh. - I was 19, and the perfect gentleman. What do you mean, fresh? - Fresh, you tried to kiss me when we walked out to see the garden. - I fell in love with you the moment I saw you. - And I wanted you to kiss me. [chuckles] - One for lunch, sir? - Ah no, I'm looking for someone. - The name of the party, sir? - I'll find her. - Thank you. - Thank you. A little light reading on your vacation? [dreamy magical music] - It's a little heavy, but I'm enjoying it. - You must be an English major. [unsettling music] You're more beautiful than I remember. - You just happened to be on this train? - I've been looking for you. - Looking for me? - Ah, do you mind if I sit down? Well actually, I really don't know where to begin. I've been living in London, I didn't know where you were living. There was no listing for you in New York. - This isn't a coincidence? - No. I picked up a magazine on a plane and your name was there. Your office told me that you'd be on this train. - What do you want? - I want to tell you what happened. - [Lily] You're a little late. - I think it's important for both of us. It's essential for me. - How dare you. I won't have this conversation with you. - Look, I know it must appear selfish, but if you just give me a chance to explain. - A chance? I don't want to hear your story. - I should have given you some notice, I'm sorry. - I still wouldn't have been interested. It was a long time ago, Alex, there's no point in going over it now. - It would mean an awful lot to me if you would just listen to what I have to say. - I don't care. - Please, please. Don't go. - We don't know each other anymore, Alex. And I don't want to know you, so leave me alone. - Lily, if you would just listen to what I have to say. - Look, either you get off this train or I will. I won't let this continue. [somber music] [sweeping romantic music] [dreamy magical music] [speaking foreign language] [speaking foreign language] [bike settles] [speaking foreign language] - Just ask him how much he wants for these boneshakers. [speaking foreign language] - How much, how much do you, you want for these four bikes? [speaking foreign language] - Oh Alex, that's too much, why don't we just meet you in Nice, we can take the train up. - No, no, it'll be fun to all go on bikes really. [speaking foreign language] [speaking foreign language] - Huh? - [Stacey] What did she say to him? - Something about his beautiful countryside. [birds chirp] [laughs] [speaking foreign language] [speaking foreign language] - How much do we owe you? [speaking foreign language] - I'll tell you about it later, Alex. - I wish someone would tell me what's going on. - I think we've got the bikes and Lily is engaged. [chuckles] [speaking foreign language] [brakes squeak] [speaking foreign language] [speaking foreign language] [bike bells ring] [sweeping romantic music] - [Alex] All right, what did you say to him? [laughs] - [Lily] I'll never tell. - [Alex] Where did you learn to speak French like that? - [Lily] My grandmother spoke French. She lived with us all my life, until she died. She was my babysitter and my best friend. - [Alex] You didn't have to promise yourself to Alain to get the bikes, did you? - [Lily] What if I had? - What? [chuckles] I would ride my bike over the nearest clip. [laughs] - I apologize for my friend, it's the first time in weeks a woman's looked at him. [sheep bleat] - Come on, you showoff. [laughs] What is this man doing? - [Lily] Sandy! - [Alex] Watch out! - Whoa! [sheep bleat] Ooof! [bike tumbles] [sheep bleat] - Oh! - Oh no! [laughs] - You idiot. [laughs] - [Stacey] Are you all right? - More or less. [laughs] Pardon, monsieur, pardon. [laughs] - [Stacey] Oh, honey. [bike tumbles] [laughs] [horse hooves clomp] [birds chirp] - Is this your first trip to Europe? - Mmmhmm. - How long you've been traveling? - Oh, a month. We started in London, and then we went to Rome, and now we're just working our way back to London. - How much longer do you have? - About three weeks, or until my money runs out, whichever happens first. [laughs] - Let's spend the rest of our vacation together. Just us. - What about Sandy and Stacey? - Look, you don't have to decide now. I mean, think about it while we're traveling. We'll all go to Nice together, then we can split up and catch up with them back in Paris. And you and I can travel up to Paris through the countryside. I know some wonderful places. Come on. Say yes. Let's just do it.

Actually, he's rather amazing and I have a lot of respect for him, but I don't really know him. He's a hard man to get to know. - Well, maybe you will when you work together. - Maybe.

Please Lily, can I have a word with you? - Go away. - [Alex] Listen, I can't get off the train, neither can you, it doesn't make any stops until the morning. Look, I'm not making this up, Lily. Well, I know that I've handled this very badly and I'm sorry, but we're both stuck on the same train and I've traveled a great distance to see you. Please, won't you at least have dinner with me? [door opens] - Come in. [door closes] You haven't changed much. - No, I have a few gray hairs, I never thought that would happen. And I can't bicycle as fast as I used to either. Have you been in New York all this time? - No, I was in Boston for three years after I graduated, and then I went back to New York. - And you're a writer? - Yes. - So's Sandy. - Is he? - Mmmhmm, he's written a couple of novels, one is about to be made into a film. - I'll bet he likes that. - [chuckles] Yeah. What happened to Stacey? - She, she married a doctor and they have three daughters. - Still keep in touch with her? - Ah no, not really. Our lives went in very different directions. - So many times I've imagined how this would feel, seeing you again. I still feel like [mumbles]. - You don't know anything about me. I'm not the same person. - Neither am I. - Part of me hates you. - I can understand that, which is all the more reason why you should listen to what I have to say. - No. - All right, I won't talk about it. Look, have dinner with me anyway. I'd like to know who you are now. I'd like you to know who I am. C'mon. How can it hurt? No. [chuckles] Nevermind, don't answer that, just say yes. [scoffs] - I'd be crazy to have dinner with you. - I'll come back in a couple of hours and I'll pick you up. - Wait, I haven't said. [shushes] [door opens] - I'll see you later. [door closes] [knocks] - [Susan] Lily, it's me, Susan. - Come in. - Boy, you work fast. Who was that guy, he looks like Clark Gable. - He's just someone I knew a long time ago. - Yeah sure, and you just happened to run into each other on the train, nice try. - Will you get off it? He's. I met him when I was traveling in Europe. - Mmhmm, and you just ran into each other on the train? - Not exactly, he was looking for me. The magazine told him where I was. - Great, what does he want? - Absolution. - What? - He wants to tell me what happened to him. - Well, I still don't understand. So, what are you gonna do? - I'm gonna have dinner with him, play his little game. - Oh. Could this be a revenge? - What are you doing here? - Huge plans, a date. - Does this have anything to do with Captain Cassini? - Si, si. But I need somethin' to wear. [door opens] Got anything? - [Lily] A date, that's very nice. - Well, I don't know how nice it's gonna be, our communication is a tad limited. - Oh well, somehow I think you'll manage. Let me see, let me see. We're gonna need something appropriate for both of us. - Got any nun's habits? [chuckles] - Afraid not. Here, why don't you wear this? [gasps] - Are you, are you kidding? Mmm-hmm, I could never wear this. No, you wear this, it looks great on you. Remember, you work to the Book Awards, all those men were flocking around you. - Really, I don't remember that. - Mmm, yeah, I was so depressed. [laughs] - All right, all right. Well, what kind of look do you want? - Ah, something ravishing, something sophisticated. Something totally unlike me. What about this? - Are you serious? You wanna wear this? - This is it, this is me. I have the perfect accessories. This man is gonna roll over and die when he sees me in this. Thanks, see ya later. - Bye. [door closes] [dreamy magical music] [exhales] [kisses] [kisses] [door opens] [door closes] [laughs] Thank you. [kisses] Oh, they're beautiful. - Did your mother really named you after those? Or is that just a family story? - No, it's true, I told you. My mother absolutely loves lilies, so she named me Lily. - What's that? - Open it. - Oh, it's beautiful, I love it. Let me put it on. - I'll do it, I'll do it. I'll fiddle around with it. Okay. [somber, emotional music] [laughs] Voila. What's wrong? - Mmm, nothing. - Come on, tell me. No secrets. - I just don't ever want to be away from you. [muffled train tracks rattle] [shade pulls] [clicks] [lights] [people chatter] [chuckles] - Well, I don't know why you're laughing, you're in serious trouble. - I'm in serious love, that's what I'm in. - You're skating on thin ice. - It's all gonna work out, love conquers all. - And I can hear it cracking. - Don't you understand, I'm in love with her and she's in love with me. - How can you be so sure, you've only known her for a couple of weeks. Don't you think you should tell her before this gets any worse? - I love her! When I'm with her, it feels as if nothing can stop me. - I've never seen you like this Alex, it's quite shocking. And for god's sake, think about your family. Think about your father. [sighs] - I'm gonna talk to him, I shall make him understand. - He'll never understand. [muffled train tracks rattle] [knocks] [cautious music] [falls] [door opens] - Are you ready? - [Lily] Yes. [door closes] [train horn honks] [train tracks rattle] [people chatter] - To train journeys with you. You look wonderful. - I knew this was a bad idea. - No, no, no, no, I'll behave. Are you married? - No, divorced. And you? - I'm divorced, too. - [Lily] Do you have any children? - No. And you? - Yes, I have the daughter. - [Alex] Do you have a picture of her? - No. - [Alex] It's pity, how old is she? - Uh, she's three, she just turned three. - [Alex] She must be fun. - She's incredible. I can't imagine what my life would be like without her. - I would imagine you're a very good mother. - Well, it was sort of trial by fire. I didn't know anything about being a mother when I had her. - Do you like your job? - Yes, very much. - You're good, that interview I read was fascinating. You did it very well. - Flattery will get you nowhere. [chuckles] - There was a time when you said it would get me everywhere. - And I was very young and silly. - Look, I know I said that I wouldn't talk about the past, but I do have something to tell you. I owe you an explanation. - It doesn't matter anymore what happened. - May I take your orders for dinner now? - I'll have the lobster please. - Yes, madam. - Would you excuse me for a moment? [somber music] - And then, every time you see her, she's got on a new dress or coat, or-- The last time I saw her, she had on a gold necklace. [door closes] [sighs] [clinks] [dreamy magical music] [taps] [door opens] - Oh hi, you're here. [door closes] Good, I have something to show you. What do you think? - It's great. - Who are you writing to? - [Alex] I was thinking of writing to my father. - You gonna tell him about me? - [Alex] Yes. - Ta-da. [clinks] [train tracks rattle] - Lily, what is it, what happened? - I just want to get off this train. - Come on, tell me what's wrong. Aren't you having dinner with that guy? - Yes. - It didn't work out the way you planned? [exhales] But, what happened between you two? - 10 years ago we were in Paris together. We were very much in love. And one night, he went to have a drink with a friend of his father's. And I never saw him again until today. - [Susan] Oh, that's awful. What does he want now? - He wants to explain. Oh god, I thought I could handle this, but I don't know. It really scares me. - Lily, what's to be afraid of? - I never felt the way I felt about him with anybody else in my life. It just terrifies me to be close to him. It took me such a long time to get over it. [train tracks rattle] [people chatter] - Alex. - Lily. [sighs] - I'm sorry, you go ahead. - This isn't easy for me. But I said I'd have dinner with you, so. Let's try it again, all right? - Look, the last thing that I want to do is to make you feel uncomfortable. I know this is strange, and it's awkward for both of us. Are you sure you're all right? - Yes. - [Alex] Okay, so what would you like to know about this stranger you're having dinner with? - Do you still work in your father's firm? - No, he's dead, it was a heart attack. I left the firm, what, eight years ago. The year he died, in fact. - [Lily] Oh, I'm sorry. - Oh, it wasn't totally unexpected. I mean, he'd had a bad heart for a number of years. - Why did she leave the business? - I didn't enjoy the work. I mean, the only reason I was there was because of my father, and I suppose, in some ways, I'm glad I gave it a try when he was alive, but it certainly wasn't what I wanted to be doing. So, when he died, it was time to go. It took me a long time to find myself, as they say. See, I was expected to go into the family business ever since I was old enough to talk, so I never really thought about doing anything else. - Oh, that's pretty. - Thank you. Do you remember that first bike ride we made from that little town in France? - Mmhm. - I'll never forget how impressed we all were with the way you bargained for those bikes. It was a great trip. How long were you married? - Um, five years. How long were you married? - The same. - [Lily] Happily? - No, not really. We should have never have gotten married. - [Lily] You know rom the beginning it was wrong? - I was in love with someone else. So it never really stood a chance. - Did she love you? - In the beginning. - How about you? What happened to your marriage, I mean. - He thought I didn't love him enough, and I thought he loved me too much. - It's always the way, isn't it? One person always seems to love the other one more. Except with us. - Except with us. [romantic music] - Do you remember that night in a cafe near Paris, when we had that awful fight? - I don't want to remember. - [Alex] It's important. - All right. We were having dinner with Sandy and Stacey, and they went dancing. - And I said let's stay and have a drink. - Mmmm. - [Alex] I need to talk to you about something. - Uh-oh, this sounds serious. - It is serious. - What is it? Alex, come on, what is it? Can't be all that bad. - I have to tell you something and it's, it's difficult. - Just tell me. - I think we should take a break from each other. Spend some time apart. - Why? - Because I need some time by myself, I have some things to figure out. - I don't understand. Why didn't you tell me this before? - I'm telling you now. - What do you mean, you're telling me now. When did you start to feel like this? At dinner? After we made love, when? - Listen, Lily, there's no point in talking about it like this, I just need some time alone. - Alex, we only have a week left, I have to go back to the States. [melancholy music] What did I do? What did I do to make you feel like this? - Please don't go, Lily, let's talk some, Lily, please. Lily, wait, please, please. I love you, please don't go, I love you. [cries] - Are you sure? - I am very sure, I didn't mean a word of what I just said, I didn't mean it. I want to be with you for the rest of my life. - Oh, Alex. [romantic music] - I couldn't tell you the truth. I couldn't get the words out. - And what was the truth? - That I was engaged to be married. She was the daughter of my father's closest friend and business associate. And I went to him that night to tell him that I was in love with you, and that the wedding to Anne was off. Hello dad. - Oh there you are, Alex. You're very late, aren't you? - Sorry. - Well, let's have a look at you. Come on, sit down, let's have something to eat. It is good to see you again after all this, long time. - It's good to see you, too. How's mum? - Oh, she's very well. Wildly excited, of course, about the wedding. She's due first thing tomorrow morning with your aunt, and the Trowbridge's are arriving late tomorrow afternoon, I understand. Have you spoken to Anne yet? - No, I haven't, not for a few weeks now. - Well, she'll be here tomorrow, won't she? Then you will have the rest of your lives together, won't you? Is something the matter, Alex? You seem a bit off-color. [somber music] - How can I make you understand what it was like for me then. I was 22, and I thought that nothing was irrevocable. - And what about us? What about the way we felt about each other? - I didn't know then that the love, passion that I felt for you was unlike anything that I was every going to experience again in my life. I didn't know at 22, that I would never again love anybody as much as I loved you. I didn't know that. I made a terrible mistake, and I've regretted it ever since. I know now that when I was with you, that was the happiest I've ever been. That's why I'm here, I wanted you to know that. I thought that I owed you that much. [sighs] Now, it's getting late. I'll see you back to your cabin. - Yes. [romantic music] [train tracks rattle] [thuds] - You all right? - Yes. [train tracks rattle] - I never stopped thinking about you. Wondering where you were, what you were doing. Wondering if you ever thought of me. [romantic music] [door opens] [train tracks rattle] [joyful music] [dreamy magical music] [water laps] [church bells chime] [gasps] [laughs] You're terrible. - Come on. - No. [laughs] - Let's meet at Nicole's at 9. - I'll be there. [footsteps click] [somber music] [speaking foreign language] [footsteps click] [train tracks rattle] [door opens] [distraught music] [exhales] - You all right? - I'm fine. - Come here. [exhales] What is it? - What do you mean, what is it? - Nothing, I just wondered where you'd gone to, that's all. - We shouldn't have spent the night together last night, it was wrong. - What do you mean it was wrong? How could it have been wrong? You can't mean that. It's wonderful. - Wasn't all that great. We spent the night on the train together, just like any two strangers. - We are not strangers. Now, you may wish that, but it's not true. - I'm not gonna go through this with you again. I've been there. I know what you can do to me and I won't let it happen. I hate you. What do you think I've been doing for the last ten years? Waiting for you to come and find me? - Of course I haven't. What are you talking about? - I think I've made myself very clear. - Stop this. Now, you're not being fair to either one of us. Now, talk to me, tell me what's wrong, what is bothering you? - I don't have to explain anything to you, and I don't care if you don't understand. - [Alex] Look, don't do this, talk to me. - You nearly destroyed my life and I don't want to have anything to do with you, now get out. - Lily, this is-- - Go. [door opens] I asked you to leave. [unsettling music] [door closes] [dreamy magical music] - Lily, you all right? - I'm pregnant. [melancholy music] - [Woman] Oh come on, how 'bout the [mumbles], you can't eat it all. - Mom? It's me. No, I'm not okay. I need to talk to you. No, not over the phone. No, I'll come home. I'll take the morning shuttle okay, can you pick me up? Okay, thanks Mom. [sniffs] No, I'm okay, I'm okay. I'll see you tomorrow. [phone clicks] [cries] [sighs] [baby cries] Oh, that's my girl. [baby coos] Oooh. [exhales] [romantic music] - [Alex] I never stopped loving you. Not for one single moment. I'm not gonna let you go this time. [urgent music] [door opens] [door closes] [frantic music] [door closes] [window slides] [wind blows] [train tracks rattle] [kisses] - I really don't do this sort of thing a lot. I really don't. - [Flavio] It's okay, I understand. I have to go now, to work. - [Susan] Promise we'll see each other in Paris? - Si, if you like. - [Susan] Ciao. - Ciao. [sweeping romantic music] [train horn honks] [muffled train tracks rattle] - I'm in trouble, Lil, big trouble. - [Lily] What kind of trouble? - I'm smitten, severely smitten. I wonder how you say that in Italian. - Ah, you had a good time. - I'm telling you. - We have to talk, Lily. - Don't go, Susan. Susan and I are having breakfast, Alex. We don't have anything else to say to each other, so please-- - I'm not leaving till I've said what I have to say. - Oh, I'll just move to another table. I don't mind, really. - You're making this very unpleasant. - I didn't want it this way. I don't know how to reach you. I knew what you were feeling last night, I could feel it, so could you, so why are you pushing me away like this? What is it? - You misread me. I'm married. I've been married for six years. - I don't believe you. - My husband and my daughter and meeting me in Paris, we're vacationing together. Now, will you leave me alone. - Why didn't you tell me this before? Do you think it would have prevented us from sleeping together? Hmm? Why did you make love with me? Why! - I didn't give it much thought. - Don't do this. - Stop it, I told you to leave me alone, now get away from me. - Right, you look me in the eye and you tell me that what happened between us last night meant nothing to you. [dramatic music] - It meant nothing. [somber music] I felt nothing. - Don't let us lose each other again. Please. - We lost each other years ago, Alex. Goodbye. - Are you all right? - I will be. - Um, this is the place we stop for supplies, I'm gonna get off and get some things. Can I get you anything? - No thanks. - A magazine? Maybe they have the New York Times, I'll get that for you, okay? - Sure. - See you in a minute. [brakes squeal] [sighs] [people chatter] Yeah? [footsteps crunch] Hi. - I'd like to apologize for this morning. - Oh, forget it. Are you getting off the train here? - I'm afraid so. - How are you gonna get to Paris? - Um, I'll rent a car. Is that new shirt? - [Conductor] All aboard, all aboard. - I better go. I just don't know, you think this is the right size? Would this fit a nine year-old? [whistle blows] It'll have to do. Anyway, nice meeting you, so long. - Oh wait, please, what nine year-old? - Come along please, miss, the train is about to leave. - What, I can't hear you. - What, what, what nine year-old you're talking about? - Alexandra, Lily's daughter, it's a gift for her. [train horn honks] [door closes] [train engine revs] [train tracks rattle] [door opens] [footsteps clomp] [suitcases thud] [speaking foreign language] [speaking foreign language] - English? [speaking foreign language] One little bit. - Could I have a ticket for the next train to Paris? - Of course. Voila, one ticket for the train to Paris, on Friday. - Friday? But I want to go today. [speaking foreign language] - This is not possible, I am so sorry. - I cannot believe this. Is there anywhere around here that I can rent a car? [speaking foreign language] What? - But, perhaps if you go to do Dijon. - Dijon, but that's absurd. - Ah, Monsieur, I am sorry, I am sorry. - Yes, well, it's not your fault. Ah, thank you. [birds chirp] [train horn honks] [traffic hums] [truck slows] [door closes] [engine revs] [train tracks rattle] [piano plays] [engine sputters] [engine revs] [train tracks rattle] [train horn honks] [engine revs] [speaking foreign language] I would like to buy that car. [speaking foreign language] [car drives] [train tracks rattle] [cries] [door opens] - Lily, what's wrong? [cries] You look awful. Okay, let's have it, what's goin' on? - I'm never gonna have a relationship that works. [cries] - What are you talking about? That's the bleakest thing I've ever heard, it'-- - I can't love anybody, I don't know how. - Lily, that's not true. You'll love somebody. - Alex was the first man I ever loved. I never thought about it ending. When he left, I lost myself. - Lily, you're not lost. You're one of the strongest women I know. - I know I'm strong, that isn't what I'm talking about. Since Alex, I've involved with men that couldn't hurt me. If I didn't love them, how could they? - Lily, you have looks I would die for. [sighs] You have a great job, you have a fabulous daughter. You're so lucky. - I didn't tell him. - Tell him what? - That he has a daughter. [cries] Lexa's his daughter. - She's what? And he, and he doesn't know? - I told him that I was gonna meet my, [sniffs] my husband and my daughter in Paris and, and that I didn't want to see him again. And then he didn't mean anything to me. - Did you mean that? - Yes. Yes. [sniffs] [sweeping romantic music] I'm gonna meet Robert in London and I'm gonna marry him. [cries] [determined orchestral music] [car drives] [muffled train tracks rattle] - I won't hear of it. [door closes] I can't believe it. - I've fallen in love with someone else, and I can't marry Anne. - I won't hear of this, it's not possible, it's absolute nonsense. - I'm not in love with Anne. I'm in love with someone else. I love her very much, probably more than I've loved anyone, and I can't marry Anne. - I suppose this other person is someone you met while you were traveling. - Her name is Lily, she's an American, and yes, I met her on a train. - [chuckles] Oh, how very lucky for you, Alex, to meet a pretty girl on a train. But there's no earthly need to get worked up about it, is there? - It's not the way I feel. - You surprise me, Alex, I thought you were a grown man by now. - I do wish you'd try and understand. - There's something I don't think you understand, Alex. Sit down, will you, something I have to tell you. I suppose you were too much preoccupied with your own silly little affairs to give a thought to what was happening in the business here. - Of course I haven't forgotten. I don't see what that's got to do with anything. - You know I started to work with Anne's father on this active industries merger before you went away. Well, because he was the principal shareholder, I naturally negotiated with him on behalf of our company. But we haven't been able to reach a final agreement yet, and now something has gone seriously wrong. Our company, your company, Alex, is in desperate trouble. This merger can save our bacon. It can stop the firm from closing down. Do you understand? Alex, look at me. Don't you see how vitally important it is now that you should marry Anne? You have an obligation to your family. If you don't fulfill the obligation, you'll be jeopardizing the whole future for a great many people who love you and whom you love. I don't see that you have any choice. - I don't love Anne, I love Lily. - You'll get over this, Alex. Such things are bound to happen sometimes, but they don't last, you know. [clock ticks] Look, I hate to admit this, Alex, but, I must make this demand of you. I need you so badly, Alex, to do this for my sake. Please say you will. [somber music] [car drives] [train tracks rattle] [urgent music] [train tracks rattle] [train tracks rattle] - [Conductor] Ladies and gentlemen, in a few moments, we will be arriving in Paris. - [Lily] We better get going. - Wait a minute. [brakes squeal] [chimes] - [Station Announcement] [speaking foreign language] - Take one of us. - All right. [chuckles] Say cheese. - [Both] Cheese. [snaps] - There you go. - Thanks, Lily, let's have one of you. - Oh no, no, I'd rather not, I want to get right to the hotel. I want to call New York, make sure Lexa got on the plane all right. - Okay, okay. I'll see you later, right? - Yes, yes, I see you. - [Susan] Do you have the address? - Yes, I have it. I see you soon, mmmhmm? Ciao. - [Susan] Okay, just checking. Ciao. - Ciao. - Ciao. - Ciao. [footsteps click] - Bye Flavio, thank you. Here you are. [car drives] [door closes] [door opens] [door closes] [engine revs] - Do you believe we're in Paris? I bet that's something famous. Isn't that fabulous, whatever it is? [traffic hums] [car horns honk] Lily, don't do something you'll regret. Find him. [sighs] - I'm going to marry Robert. [traffic hums] [car horns honk] [dials] Hello, Robert? Hi. No, we just got in this evening. Yes, we had a wonderful time. The train's beautiful. Oh, I'll be picking up Alexa in the morning, and what I thought we'd do is, I thought we'd do a little sightseeing, and then take a night flight to London. Yes, it's all arranged. [somber music] I miss you too, sweetheart. And I have something to tell you. No, no, it's good news. Yes. Okay, well, I'll see you tomorrow night then, all right? Right, buh-bye. [phone settles] [romantic music] [drawer closes] [footsteps click] [traffic hums] [raindrops fall] [footsteps click] [footsteps click] - [Airport Announcement] TWA Flight 800 from New York, now arriving-- [plane engine roars] [door opens] - [Airport Announcement] [speaking foreign language] [traffic hums] [people chatter] - Hi Mom! Hi. [laughs] - Oooh, hello my darling, I'm so glad you're here. Let me look at you. Oh, you look so beautiful. Are you tired, honey? - No, not really. - Would you like to do some sightseeing? - Yeah. - Come on. [traffic hums] [brake clicks] [door closes] [footsteps clomp] - [Flavio] Okay? - All right. - Flavio. Flavio, do you remember me? - Why yes, of course. - I'm looking for Miss Parker and her friend, do you know where they are? - They are at the hotel, the address is 25 Rue St. John. - Thank you, thank you. - You're welcome. [car horns honk] [car horns honk] [car horns honk] [engine revs] [bells ring] [speaking foreign language] - Oui, Monsieur, how may I help you? - I'd like to see Miss Parker, please, Lily Parker. She's traveling with another woman, Susan, I don't know her last name. - Oh yes, the photographer. They checked out about an hour ago. - Checked out? Well, where did they go, to another hotel? - I don't know where they went, Monsieur. - They must have left a forwarding address or something. - They were only here for a night, why should they leave a forwarding address? - Yes, I suppose you're right. Thank you. - Monsieur. There was some talk about sightseeing, they took a map. - Where? - Monsieur. [dreamy romantic music] [footsteps click] [birds chirp] - [Lexa] Were you ever in Paris before, Mom? - Yes, but it was a long time ago. - Was that before I was born, Mom? - Mmmhmm. I wonder where Susan is, I'm sure she said she'd meet us at one. - [Lexa] There she is! [footsteps clomp] - Hi. - Come on, Mom, we can go in now. - Okay, sweetie, we'll be right there. Hi, what happened? - I said goodbye to Flavio. - Oh, you'll see him again. - No. I told him I thought it was better to just leave it as nice brief affair. - Why? - Because there's no future in it. He's Italian and lives in Rome, I'm American, I live in New York. I finally meet somebody and geography kills it. Come on. - Ah, you come on. Do you love him? - Maybe. Probably. Yes. [laughs] Well, you'll work it out. [traffic hums] [metal rumbles] [traffic hums] [brake clicks] - What you think, Lexa? - I want to live here. - Oh, you do? - If, if I move to Rome, would you two come and visit me? - Yes, and I'd learn how to speak Italian. - What's wrong with him moving to New York? You just got a promotion. - Who are you talking about? - Oh, a friend of Susan's that she met on the train. - Did you meet anyone on the train, Mom? - Yes. Yes, I met a very nice man. [somber romantic music] - You should take a little of your own advice and go find him. - I'm gonna marry Robert, I made up my mind. Now, can we please stop talking this? - Okay. [sweeping romantic music] [footsteps clomp] - I'm terribly sorry, I thought you were someone else. [footsteps click] [birds chirp] [footsteps click] - My feet are killing me. - You should wear sneakers. - You're right. Don't ever stop wearing sneakers even when you start thinking men'll like better in heels, okay? - No way. - Do you think men like us better in heels or do you think we like us better in heels? - I'm too tired to answer such a complex question. - Let's go get some ice cream. - Great idea, ice cream always makes my feet feel better. - There's a place! Come on! [footsteps click] [traffic hums] - What kind of ice cream you having, Lexa? - Chocolate, chocolate, chocolate. - Oh god. [traffic hums] [melancholy music] - Mmm. - [Lily] What is it, Lexa? - There's this man across the street. He's just standing there, staring at me. - [Lily] Well, don't look at him. [sweeping romantic music] - Lily. [romantic music] [swooshes]
