"Remembering Lalla" THE LEGEND OF THE HOLY DRINKER a story by Joseph Roth [in French] Where do you go, brother? Where am I going? Where do I go? Who knows! You are a foreigner. I can show you the way. What? It is God that puts you on my way, I am certain of it. I have to ask you a great favor. - You ask me a favor? - Certainly. I know that you are worth of it. It will be my pleasure. Don't get offended if I talk to you frankly. In this moment you are in some difficulty. You are in need of money. No! dont be offended, it can happen to anybody. I have many more money than I need. Please, please. Wont you tell me how much you need, just tell me. - Twenty francs would be all right? - You need more than that. - You need at least two hundred. - Two hundred? Two hundred of course would be a lot better. - I cannot accept. - Why not? Cos' I would not know how to pay back the money. You cannot even come after me to ask for it. I havent got a house, I sleep under the bridges. Every night a different bridge. But I am a man of honor, I know how to behave. I just dont have an address thats all. I have no address either, cant even tell you the name of the bank. Now, do take this money and don't worry about it. In any case it is a ridiculous sum for a man like you. I know that you are a man of honor. So when you are in the position to repay the money, will you do me the favor which I ask you. I must confide to you... ... an extraordinary thing. I have read the story of little Th?r?se... ... the saint of Lisieux. Since then I've been living a miracle... ... a real miracle., The miracle of conversion This way I have decided to live the life of the poor men... ... as all those that come here, to sleep under the bridges. I am particularly devoted to the statuette of little Th?r?se. It is in the church of Sainte Marie de Batignolles... ... in the right hand of aisle, along the wall. - But me... There is no hurry. When you will be in the position to repay the money... ... if your conscience not to allow you to remain in debt... ... take the money to the priest after the mass. If there is someone whom you are in debt, from now on... ... it is to little Th?r?se. So don't forget the address of the saint. Thanks. Then I give you my word I will keep my word. - I think it is best to go on Sunday. - Perfect. It is a great pleasure. "Saint Th?r?se." "Sainte Marie... " "... de Batignolles." A soup! [F] Here. [F] - It is Thursday! - Already. - I was born on Thursday. - Then have a nice Thursday. - You too. [F] A coffee, please. - No a rum. - We don't serve alcohols. A moment. I'll be right back. [F] A coffee with rum, please. [F] Twelve francs. How would you like a job? Tomorrow I have to move. You can earn something. I have already called two movers, but my wife is worrying. I've got a shop to mind. What about giving us a hand. - Certain. - It would be for two days. - Two days? - Tomorrow and Saturday. For me it is all right. - Two hundred francs OK? - Yes, thanks. Then we agree. - Perfect. - Let's drink to it. I'll offer. Because, today it is really a fine day. It is Thursday. - It is my birthday. - Indeed? More or less. The next one is on me. It is a matter of honor. You look at my hands, they are worker's hands... ... but I am also a gentleman. - Certain. Here is my calling card, of the shop. I'll write the address here. - What are you doing? - It is my turn, don't you remember? Take these on account, so you come tomorrow for sure. And when the job's done, I will give you the rest... ... and we will make a toast. Now my friend, I have to go. Don't forget it. Tomorrow... ... at eight o'clock. - Eight o'clock. - Good-bye, my friend. Me... - I would like a wallet. - A wallet? Yes. Maybe we have something for you. These are like new. The customers change them just to have the most recent ones. They are equal and they cost much less. - Oh I see. - Do you like this one? It is very beautiful. Good-bye. [F] Good morning. - Start from the kitchen. [F] I am here for... - Good morning, this way. My husband has said that I can trust you. For the most fragile things we will use the newspapers. - You know how to do it? - Yes. I do it all the time. - First thing you did? - I was a miner... ... like my father and some farmer was my grandfather. They are delicate things. Take it. - See you tomorrow at seven o'clock. - At seven o'clock. - See you later. - Don't spend it all to drink! Good, you have not spent all to drink. Come. Yes, lady. Good-bye. - Here! [F] It is ready in table! Good-bye, my friend. Goodbye. - Today it is Saturday, true? - Yes. So tomorrow it is Sunday. "Debt, 200 francs." "Account, 100 francs." "To have, 100 francs."

[F] I'll pay, please. - No it was my invitation. - The gentleman has asked the account. Then you are rich. Yes. In these last days I started to believe in miracles. Do you believe in miracles? I don't know how to dance! Have not you danced since then? I always loved to dance! Come in. [F] > Mr.! > Mr.! > We are closing. Why didnt you come to see me on Sunday? How do you dare to speak to me like this? - You forget that I am your father. - Forgive me father. But do me a favor. On Sunday morning come to me... ... in the church of Sainte Marie de Batignolles. Th?r?se! Forgive me! I thought I was dreaming. I dreamt to have a daughter like you. [F] - Good morning. - You can change them for me? A note of 500 francs. Give it to me. - Who is he? - Do you know him? He is the greatest! Kaniak! Daniel Kaniak! He is from Slesia. He is my friend! In photo it seems like another person. We went to school together when we were kids. He is the greatest. Do you know where I can find him? Only to greet him. In a hotel of the Champs-Elys?eses. - How do I get there? - With a taxi.

But what are you doing? - I have a debt to pay. - On Sunday? Yes. I am a little late already. So I have to leave. - To whom you owe money to? A man or a woman? - To the girl Th?r?se. - You hog get out of here bastard! - Hey! Bye. Andreas! - Woitech! - Andreas! - Andreas! - You wait for me here until the mass is over? The mass? You have deceiving the priests too? - No, I have to go see the little Th?r?se. - What for? - I owe her some money. - I have a debt with the little saint. - How much do you owe her? Two hundred francs. Then I come with you. Is it all right? What are you doing? What's the matter? I am in trouble. There is a man that waits for me out there. I have to give him back 200 francs, otherwise they will arrest me. You should have told me before. I didn't have the courage. I understand. It might also happened to me. Hey c'mon, dont worry. Take it... ... I dont need it. - See you at the bar! > Shh! Andreas! Come here! Sit! - You are a real friend! - We are more than brothers... ... after what we have lived. - Friends in everything and for everything! You know... I used to know a dancer at the Casino. - Indeed? - Yes. I was in love for two days. I succeed in falling in love also in ten minutes. - You know what day is today? - Lets find out. I have lost the account. See you on Sunday, same time, same place. Bye! Do you need some money? I know, I am still in debt to you. To me? I was supposed to deliver the money to little Th?r?se. I can assure you I went there every Sunday, but every time something went wrong. You mistaken me with someone else, but I can see... ... you are in some difficulty. And as for Th?r?se... I have such an obligation to her. That I would gladly advance you any mony that you need... How much is it? Two hundred francs. Excuse me. There... I must assure you that I am still an honorable man. - But unfortunately I don't have an address yet. - Just like me! I don't care. The kindness that you do me accepting the money... ... it is something that I could never repay. Because I too owe a lot to little Th?r?se. So I thank you dear gentleman. [F] You have to pay the bill. Excuse me. Mr.. [F] Do you look for something. You had lost it. Here it is! It is normal when you are drunk too many appetizers. Hold it more carefully. Hey! It's me. Andreas Kartak. Miner. Same mine... ... same tunnel. You come here, my friend. Sit here! To the place of honor. The friends always sit on the place of honor. You are my friend too. Friends for everything and in everything. Listen. A little while ago it happened me... I was crossing the square something extraordinary happened to me. A police officer stops me... ... and I think: "Now he will ask me for my papers." "I am really in trouble." Instead, he tells me that I have lost my wallet... ... and he gives me a wallet which is not mine. It is a sign of God. I had to accept it. Look... Two hundred francs. Now... ... I am going to pay my debt. - Dont do it now The priests are still saying mass. When it is over, you can go there to sacristy. What are you doing here? I am waiting for my parents. In a little while, they will get out of mass and come and get me. We always do it this way. Every fourth Sunday. - Will you tell me your name? - Th?r?se. Th?r?se! It's perfect. I'd never thought that a saint... ... so great and yet so little... ... a creditor so little and yet so great... ...do me the honor to come to me after I have failed such a long time... ...to come to her. I know. It is your delicacy and your preciousness. But I failed. I owe you two hundred francs... ... and I couldnt pay them back for so long... Miss Saint! But you owe me nothing. Yes! I... I have tried so many times... ... but... - If you need it... ... I have a little money... ... in my bag. Take it. Now I have to go, because mass is almost over... ... and my parents will be coming. Woitech! - Help me. - Andreas! My friend! - You need a drink. [F] Let's bring him to the church. The priest knows what to do. Put him there. Get further you, allow him to breathe. "May God grant all of us drinkers such a good and easy death."
