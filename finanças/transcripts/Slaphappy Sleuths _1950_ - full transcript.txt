[♪] MAN: Gentlemen. Many of our gas stations are being constantly held up. We feel it is the work of an organized gang. I need three brainy, but, uh, stupid looking private detectives who can pose as gas station attendants. That is why I sent for you. Gentlemen! Oh-ho. ALL: Good morning, boss. Well, you fellas are certainly stupid looking enough but about being brainy detectives that's open to conjecture. BOTH: Oh, thank you. I'll button mine. Were you ever in danger? Did anyone ever point a gun at you? Yeah, but he couldn't shoot me. How come? I had my finger in the barrel, ha-ha! [LAUGHING] My partner, very funny. Give way. Uh, you-- You were in the service, weren't you? MOE: That's right. Get a commission? No, just straight salary. [MOE LAUGHING] Hah, that's my partner, just clownin'. Quiet. You. Are you a good detective? Am I? You see this heel? I ran that down, ha-ha. [CRUNCH] Oh! Boys, this is serious. Do you know anything about running gas stations? ALL: No. Well, that's good. Then the robbers will think you're easy prey. Now here's a list of our latest robberies. Study it. And there's another report... Oh. You silly. Foolin' around with a knife. Are you crazy? Oh! Ooh! Ooh! Aah! Aah! Oh! Oh! Boss. What's the matter? [GROANING] What's the matter? [GASPS] Ow! You ain't got nothing to worry about boss, you ain't even got a hole in your pants.
