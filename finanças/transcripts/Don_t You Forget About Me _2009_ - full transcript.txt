[CAR STARTING] [MELLOW MUSIC PLAYING] MAN 1: I've not seen or heard from him in a long time. MAN 2: I'm not gonna go there. There's a lot of stuff there that is not my business. MAN 3: He was... we're not on camera. Okay. MAN 4: I haven't spoken with John Hughes since 1988. WOMEN: I really, you know, I don't know, I'm sure he's doing fine. ♪ Some feelings Are so simple ♪ But too hard to state ♪ I mean, there have been some people who've said that Hugh has abandoned his teen audience at a certain point. He seems to have kind of gone into semi-retirement. He just took his bat and ball and went home. Look at the kind of thing that John did. Where is that now? He hasn't directed a film since '91. And he sort of went like that to Hollywood. He made five really wonderful flicks about being a teenager. MICHAEL: I wanna start off just with a little prayer. I don't have anything planned, but ya, let's just hold hands. KARI: You know what this... MICHAEL: Hands in the middle. Hold hands. MATT: No, no. KARI: Hands in the middle. MATT: Hold hands. This has been the best two and a half years of my life. And I wanna thank all of you. And um... Whether we find John Hughes or not, I think the journey is what matters. And um... And yeah, and also... Look. Back to van. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] Are those gonna stay? No. [CHUCKLES] Oh, yeah. It's actually kind of perfect. LENNY: Do we have one for the other side? KARI: Should we put on the back, actually? LENNY: I am suggesting we should get on the road. KARI: Yeah. We're gonna find John Hughes. ♪ Won't you come see about me? [PEOPLE MURMURING] MATT: Which way do we go to get to the 401, man? LENNY: Where, a one way? ♪ Don't You ♪ Forget About Me ♪ Don't Don't Don't Don't ♪ Don't You ♪ Forget About Me ♪ Don't You ♪ Forget About Me ♪ Don't Don't Don't Don't ♪ Don't You ♪ Forget About Me ♪ MAN: Can you say what we're doing, Matt? We're on our way to Chicago. But yeah, we're on our way to Chicago, because that's where John Hughes shot all of his movies, and that's where John Hughes currently lives. ♪ Maybe I was wrong to Jump to the conclusion ♪ But I don't really dare to Let lie my suspicions About two and a half years ago, Lenny and I met to discuss the potential screenplay we want to try. And we both decided we wanted to write a teen film. Now, we really want to make something that was kind of similar to the movies that we grew up and loved, and the fact that some are John Hughes films. So, the more we racked our brains to try and come up with a John Hughes film, the more we realized how much of a genius the guy was and how impossible it is. You know, like, if you look at that &quot;Some Kind of Wonderful&quot; DVD, there is an actual interview footage with Hughes. And you're like, really? That was the guy? Aside from his, you know, rock 'n' mullet when you look at that guy and be like, that's the person who's gonna speak to teenagers like he's fucking Jesus Christ. I did say that John Hughes was the philosopher of adolescence. And I believe that more now, than I probably did at the time when I wrote that. What the hell are you bitching about? I gotta sleep under some Chinaman named after a duck's dork. Where am I sleeping? Sofa city, sweetheart. [CLICKS FINGER] John's real sort of genius is that he was not afraid and he created these, sort of, comic elements to allow that to be sort of heavy material, but digested with comedy in a way that people can really relate to. I, being like Salieri and Amadeus, filled with bitterness and jealousy. Thought how can he just channel these things? It's just amazing. This is ridiculous, okay. I'll go. I'll go. I'll go. I'll go. I'll go. With I'll go. Shit! [STARTS CAR] He was creating his own reality. He was writing and directing the world that he wanted to see. Hughes was always a genius at tapping into the biggest hopes, and fears, and dreams, and insecurities, and things that matter the most to teenagers. Your grandmother has just passed. What? That's how he cast and that's what he was attracted to. Was something kinda off in people. I think John was a big old geek in school. So that was his fantasy that, you know, he would be the, the geeky guy who, nevertheless, you know, ruled the school, and gets the girl, that, you know, and that would all work out in the end. [DRUM 'N' BASS MUSIC PLAYING] ALLY: I think John was writing characters very often that were, sort of him. And how he felt, you know, how he operated. I know there was a lot of the feeling or the experience of being, the outcast and underdog for him. I think he's still probably feels that way. I don't even count, right? JOHN BENDER: I could disappear forever, and it wouldn't make any difference. KEVIN: Hughes was just insanely gifted. It's like going, &quot;how come people don't write as well as Shakespeare?&quot; It's like, well, there was one Shakespeare. That dialog is important enough that it can never be goofy regardless of, you know, what we wear or what kind of missile comes through our house. You know. [CHUCKLES] [FIREWORKS BURSTING] KELLY: You know, when the mother is making the sauce in one of the movies, and ash is falling into the the meal, I mean, that's, that's what he does best. He paints the details that other people don't pay attention to. John was a good writer. And I think that's everything. We were a good combination 'cause I found kids that had talent to match his writing. And nowadays, they don't start with good writing, and then they, they don't get the talent. I fell asleep on his couch about five in the morning 'cause John was doing rewrites for &quot;Some Kind of Wonderful.&quot; And when I woke up, he handed me fifty pages. And he said... I said, &quot;What's this? &quot;We were just doing a couple of pages of rewrites?&quot; You know. He said, &quot;Oh, I didn't do that. &quot;I did something else, just tell me what you think?&quot; And it was the first fifty pages of Ferris Bueller's Day Off. And he did it in like five hours. He almost had an assembly line because he was so proficient, and so prolific. And he had all of these screenplays pouring out of his typewriter, and maybe eventually his computer. The sportos, the motorheads, geeks, sluts, bloods, wastoids, dweebies, dickheads. They all adore him. They think he's a righteous dude. I think Ferris Bueller is a perfect movie. I think if I had directed Ferris Bueller , I would, I'd call it a day, you know. I'd be like, okay, I'm good. MAN: These are artful films. These are smart movies. When look back on them, they don't embarrass you. A lot of 80's movies do embarrass you. He was a master, you know, at what he did and what he crafted. And also wasn't really thinking about it as he did it. You know, it wasn't like Hughes said, &quot;I'm gonna set out &quot;to create a genre.&quot; MATT: Then we kind of decided, why don't we make a film about two screenwriters trying to find John Hughes to help them get their film made. Fast forward a couple of months later I realized that, that would be stupid. And that we should actually not make a fictional film about it, but a documentary. We want to explore, why we felt teenagers were relating to the John Hughes films of the 80's more than anything in the last decade. [ DON'T TALK DOWN PLAYING] ♪ Don't ♪ Don't talk down ♪ To me ♪ My favorite Johny Hughes film would have to be Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Weird Science , yeah. The Breakfast Club. Ferris Bueller's Day Off. That was an amazing movie. I would have seen it twenty times since I was a kid. You went and saw it, 'cause you actually want to see the movie, 'cause it was well written and well done. I can see myself more in that movie rather than the movies of today. You can relate to it really easily, 'cause it's just how people are in real life. There's the struggles of actual high school. It's very real. It doesn't seem like they took a bunch of celebrities, and dressed them up, and put all this make-up on them, and got them to go and act for them. And in The Breakfast Club, you actually kind of get to see who that person really is. Molly Ringwald had a really natural look to it. Why kids still respond to these films is because he put his heart into it. There's something that was very important to him. So all these sort of offbeat characters like Cameron or in Pretty in Pink, Duckie, Jon Cryer's character. These sort of offbeat guys that had problems. I think that's all John, and I think that's something that he was saying, you know, &quot;Pay attention to this.&quot; The question that keeps coming up on this documentary is, well, have you gotten Hughes? Have you gotten Hughes? And our answer has always been we want this to be a love letter to John Hughes, and we want John Hughes to come back. But it's kind of been unavoidable, and I think we've realized the most important thing to do here is to actually go and find the man himself and, and get the answers from him if we possibly can. What we found in these two years is how much of an impact he has on probably everyone we've spoken to. I think though he'll be blown away by seeing fourteen-year olds, thirteen-year olds saying I've watched Ferris Bueller's Day Off 27 times. KARI: Yeah. Like I want him to see that. KARI: You don't usually get a tribute like this until you're dead. Don't worry about it. You're young. Not anymore. No one in my estimation has come close to what John achieved. Why do you think it'd be easy? For a while there, you could say teen movie. And it wasn't derogatory. I'd say teen movie, and you can go, &quot;Yeah, it's a good movie.&quot; For the first time in my life, I don't feel like a total dick. The category teen films, that category is entirely tied to the 80's. Right now there are very, very few movies what I think anyone, I mean teenagers or really anyone else, can look at the screen, and say, &quot;Yeah, that's me.&quot; He put real life people into movies. That's why it worked. Everybody felt akin. Everybody knew somebody who was on that screen. Oh, why can't we start old and get younger? They can see themselves and say,&quot;You know, oh, &quot;I relate to that. &quot;I now know how to conduct my life, &quot;based on how these people did.&quot; All the people I went to school with were like the people in The Breakfast Club. You know, they weren't the other people. You know, they weren't the, the cool normal people. It was sort of, a school for slightly not normal people. My best friend in high school was a kid who got, like violent nose bleeds, every twenty minutes of the day. You know. Or another kid who could tell you whatever you need to know about the Denver Broncos. Molly was fifteen or sixteen, Andy Michael Hall was true. That was another thing, they were true to the age. MIA: I was actually seventeen. I mean, if you can imagine your most, like shaming, horrific year in high school is like, immortalized in a very popular movie for ever and ever. That's how it feels to me. I guess I've been subconsciously kind of waiting for that moment where nobody has seen the movie anymore. And that moment hasn't come, really. There is something kind of genius in casting Molly Ringwald, particularly in Sixteen Candles 'cause she does look like the average 16-year old girl. She is not like this gift from the heavens, fucking knock out. Now she doesn't look like she was trimmed out of Playboy, and they put clothes on her or something like that. She looks like a teenager. KELLY: Molly Ringwald had a lovely, fresh, real look about her. And today you've gotta be, you know, the extensions down to here, or boobs up to here, you know. Otherwise you don't fit the criteria. So you gotta wait around an hour. If I want to. Do you know how much damage we could do to each other in an hour? I feel like a lot of these young women, now they seem really interchangeable. Now all of a sudden they're blond, they're... The skinny blond anorexic girl number one versus the other one. With the freckly one or the one with no freckles, one with the smaller boobs, it just doesn't... They all seem sort of interchangeable. I'm certainly glad I am not starting as an actress, now. I would have lasted probably like a week and a half. You just can't imagine Molly Ringwald having that kind of attention in this kind of the harshness of the attention on young actresses today. Whether or not it's courted, you know, um... It's really freaky, and kind of scary. I mean, I can't imagine trying to be that age in in that environment. Don't analyze it. Just go. I think that there is some lovely young actresses out there now, but the machine immediately ingest them, and even if they do something fantastic, and the next week they're on the cover of Vanity Fair, in some lace panties, with their hands down their own pants. You didn't know how much blow Molly Ringwald was doing or what she was, you know, if she shaved her vagina or whatever, I mean, just the amount of information that's available about Lindsay Lohan was insane. Have they put on weight? Have they taken off weight? Are they pregnant? Are they not pregnant? Are they dating? Did they break up? Are they back together again? It's kind of an unwholesome spotlight. That twenty-five years ago, when Hughes was working, his actors had attention. They got attention, but not that kind of attention. ♪ Don't ♪ Don't talk down ♪ To me ♪ I think a lot of the movies today are almost cliche. I find it hard to really see a life behind a lot of the characters in today's films. They don't really show like, the middle, the average. My life isn't as exciting as the people who are on screen. I don't think anyone's is. One thing in particular that teens have mentioned is that they don't feel and the teen males in particular were the highest on this chart. Um, that movies today, they can't relate to movies today. The movies today don't relate to things going on in their lives. I can give you two good reasons why not. My mother and my father. They're married and they hate each other. The teen films of today are certainly different from John Hughes' films of the eighties, in that, uh, they, for some reason, don't respect the audience the way Hughes did. Uh, there was an intelligence to Hughes' film. There was an honesty to the characters across the board. When I watch teen films today, they seem to be caricatures instead of the real thing. The Hughes characters and actors that played the characters looked like people you went to school with. You know, and you watch a flick like that and you're like, &quot;I could fucking tag that broad.&quot; You know, &quot;I can probably get her.&quot; Um, and I don't know if girls think this way. I doubt it, but I'm sure they're sitting there going, like, I could fuck Judd Nelson, or Anthony Michael Hall. Although probably not. The recent movies are so slick. The kids all seem to be sophisticated beyond their years, in a way that's not entirely healthy. [POP MUSIC PLAYING] High school is nothing like what high school is like in movies. Especially our school. Teenagers now do a lot of nothing. I feel like they build it up a lot more than it really is. Most kids don't wake up and get in their SL55, you know. I definitely feel like I'm not well represented in the movies. I get good grades and I don't think that's shown, like, being smart is not cool in movies. I don't think I'm represented at all. I think that they're, they're too fake. Now guys in leads in teen movies are more like the perfect guy. They got the perfect bodies, perfect face, perfect hair. Everything just seems so right. It's all tits and ass, really. Everything is different. The industry is different, the audiences are different. The people we've spoken to, you could not go to a studio right now and bring them Breakfast Club. No, I think if you brought Breakfast Club right now to a studio that's gripped. They would be like, they wouldn't know what to do with it. Too boring they'd say. When you grow up, your heart dies. Who cares? I care. So we had to depend on very good actors, and they had to depend on his very good dialog to make that into a box office hit. Even though you couldn't really pitch that to a studio head and make it sound like it would be commercial at all. We heard something kind of disturbing at a studio meeting. Where they said, you know, we're casting a film and we wanted it to relate to young audiences and stuff. And Napoleon obviously wasn't a studio movie. It was completely independent. So there really wasn't any outside creative push on it. And I said, &quot;High &quot;school students are aspirational.&quot; You should set the bar for them in casting. Little bit older than they are 'cause they wanna be older. And that would taint every other decision you make on down the line when you're doing creative development for these characters and that's I think the heart of the problem. It's become a lot about bottom line and um, cost and eh, what they hope to net. Pre-sell things and it's all about not really about what the movies is about, it's all about how much money you can make. When you make one of these movies you have to make it for a certain amount of money because they can look at now historically and say, okay will they top out at this. So between the budget and the P&amp;A, we can only spend this because this is who our audience is. The goal of when you make a movie is to try to get, nowadays because it's so concentrated on opening weekend, is to try to get as broad appeal as possible. You wanna get all four quadrants. And the four quadrants are males under 25, females under 25, males 25 and older females 25 and older. Most teen movies, I think, are bureaucratic decisions. Let's go after that demographic and make a movie that'll appeal. There hasn't been one in a year, let's do it. You know, it's not like they come from a sense of urgency to write a character or to write a story about something that needs to be told. I couldn't make even Pump Up The Volume now at the studio level. It's too small. The costs of making things in a studio system are so big they have to be, they have to appeal to the broadest audience. Today we're getting teenage movies that although you see some good ones, by large they tend to be movies with cheaper values, more superficial characters, more exploitation. Bullshit, man. Come on, Verne. Kids haven't changed. You have. I think that movies are becoming more and more like theme rides. Where they just sort of have a beginning middle and end and instead of like up, down, curve, [EXCLAIMS] scary moment, dip and then, [EXCLAIMS] you're over and you go, &quot;Shit, I just spend 17 bucks.&quot; I have a theory, I think John Hughes is coming back. John Hughes writes under the alias Edmond Dantes. If you're familiar with the film The Count of... Not the film the book The Count of Monte Cristo [CHUCKLES] MATT: The film was good too. The film was good too, yeah. The book is better. What are you, a 100 pages done? KARI: How familiar are you with it? You've done five pages. That's not true. I'm at a 130 pages. Edmond Dantes, who is this 19 year old, very talented sailor. So basically he gets framed for being a Bonapartist. And they send him to the Chateau d'If, which is an island of the coast of France, where he's imprisoned. Edmond Dantes comes back... See I read the book. KARI: Hah, he read the close notes. No, I read the book. LENNY: Weren't you accused of being a bonapartist? Edmond escapes the Chateau fourteen years later and he comes back as the Count of Monte Cristo. He wears a mask. His goal is to seek revenge on the people that have harmed him. Molly Ringwald is actually quoted as saying [LENNY AND KARI LAUGHS] I'm serious. Molly Ringwald is quoted as saying, &quot;He will have the last laugh.&quot; And I think that's been true. I think John Hughes is waiting to come back. John Hughes is saying, &quot;He took from me, I was making these stories. &quot;I was capturing innocence. I was &quot;doing all these things and I was doing &quot;it to bring joy in story telling.&quot; And it was taken away from him. Now he writes some movies and puts other people's names on them occasionally and things like that. He was this tough guy to nail down in terms of like, you don't read many interviews with him past that era when he was actually making flicks. He doesn't do commenter tracks on his DVDs. Party is over. MAN: Party's over. There's a girl. Come on, get out of here. When you're hungry, you don't have money in the bank. I think he probably has quite a bit of money in the bank. He loves his kids, he loves his family. Takes a big man to step out from something that fed his pockets so well. He didn't want to have to have to answer. You know, he wanted to keep doing the stuff he was doing. HOWARD: I think he had not a good experience in Hollywood and he cares about the material and his work too much to kind of like, have it go through the shredding machine. They'll come back and go now don't we don't want to do that, we rather add another action piece or, you know, an exploding toilet scene. Well, Hollywood's in terrible shape now. You know, they are doing remakes and The studios are all owned by corporations now and so they are, they are very product oriented now. KAPELOS: When I first came to L.A. he let me call my mother one night after a screening of something in his car and he drove. You know, I was like his enamorate of the whole, you know, palm trees, I didn't realize that razz was on the top of it. ALAN: It's more comfortable for him To make these things, to make these entertainments. To tell these stories and then keep his private life private. You don't understand that it has nothing at all to do with you. Maybe he feels that the kind of teenage movie that does hit the box office today is not the kind of movie he wants to make. Hughes was always in the underdog's corner. He was always rooting for... let's say, that Judd Nelson character. And Molly Ringwald in Pretty in Pink. You reach a point where your movies are making hundreds of millions of dollars. And that's start to seem disingenuous. And so, I think he kind of gave up because he realized He just can't make those movies honestly anymore because that's not who he is not anymore. You are right, you're absolutely... Absolutely right. I 'd say applaud the man for the work he did, and applaud the man for the lesser work that he never produced. Like, the dude got out while the getting was good. [ROCK 'N' ROLL MUSIC PLAYING] ♪ I'll follow you around From bar to bar ♪ I am driving you Everywhere in my car ♪ It's all just a game ♪ I guess things have changed ♪ Wahoo ♪ I wanna test 'em out. I wanna test 'em out. Hold on. All right, where're you coming from? MAN: We're going to Chicago where a film maker named John Hughes shot a bunch of his films and we're shooting landmarks and stuff. MICHAEL: How do you guys all know each other? MATT: Juvi, we're all young offenders. MAN: Okay, Matt. Don't talk to Matt. Matt you sit back. MICHAEL: Are you carrying any alcohol or drugs on you? I actually do have prescription pills on me right now. So maybe we should mention that. No, maybe you shouldn't. KARI: Maybe you should take one and sedate yourself. MICHAEL: Lenny, you have to keep me calm here. LENNY: Everyone stop looking so guilty. MICHAEL: Matt, find the girl. If it's a girl go to the girl lane. EVERYONE: No. MATT: You picked this lane. LENNY: Put all the chutes down. KARI: Pass him out the passports. MATT: Pulling this guy over. We're in trouble. Weird Science. Now that was a good movie. Pretty in Pink, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, frankly the favorite film of Richard Roeper, my partner on this television program. RICHARD: It is a film that I enjoy watching over and over again so, you know, if people wanna go around saying that, I've said Ferris Bueller's Day Off is my favorite movie of all time. Fine. I'll stick with that. The dude's an evergreen. You can always look in like, the top one hundred at Amazon and there'll be one or more Hughes titles in there. No one goes to make a film about teenagers without drawing from John Hughes. No one goes to make a movie about teenagers without watching a John Hughes' films again. Watching one of his films before you go out to make a teenage film is good and it's bad. It's good in that, it's an enormous influence. It's bad in that you kinda feel that you couldn't really quite do it as well. I mean, there is not much you could do to do it better. You know, that whole time I was just thinking things over. I can't say with absolute certainty whether we were imitating Hughes. Or whether he had captured us. MICHAEL: Welcome to Michigan. [CLASSIC ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] LENNY: The first film that I really, that really got me was The Breakfast Club. Which is lot of people's favorite. And I think it was the first, I don't know why I loved it so much when I first saw it, but I just like, it was the one movie I can watch over and over and over again. I must have watched it like hundreds of times and I could recite every line. As I watched the movie over the years I was younger than them but now I still watch it. Now I am much older than they were, so it's kind of like... it's that movies captures a moment of time in your life. You knew everyone in that group 'cause you know everyone in high school, like that. People there are like people you knew and cause you all talk like that, you've all done those things. KARI: He broke the silence for everyone and everyone watching, it was like, okay. Does that mean, everyone else is feeling the way I am feeling, maybe I can just exhale a little bit. It's not like I watched The Breakfast Club and I could remember the defining moment where I was like, yeah that's the first time I saw it. I actually just don't remember a time where those movies weren't in my life. Watching them now is when I I really identify with them more. When you look at The Breakfast Club that's almost the My Dinner with Andre of teenage movies. I mean, in a way a group of kids, in detention hall on Saturday talking for two hours. That's basically it. There was no plot in Breakfast Club. I don't think it felt like there needed to be. It was about getting down to the inner lives of the five kids and that they in themselves were interesting enough. There just didn't have to be any kind of gimmick or anything else. Well, everyone's home life is unsatisfying. ANDREW: And if it wasn't, people would live with their parents forever. Most people thought, &quot;Well, if they're gonna be kids. &quot;You know, maybe you should show 'em, you know, &quot;practicing blow jobs on a carrot.&quot; But Hughes wasn't doing that. Dialog for that particular type of movie is absolutely essential because you're trading in special effects, you're not, you know, putting your two-minute nudity on the screen. You're not, nobody is like, sitting there and doing kick boxing and shit like that, or no robots. So you're missing out on like stuff that would make people come see your flick in first place. So... So. It's one of those, like quintessential, like high school movies. So, I don't know, it just, it captures high school in a more realistic way than anything you'd see today. John's movies in words should give respect to teenagers. You know, respected them as sort of complete whole human beings who were having as valid an experience as the 30-year old and the 40-year old. My dad had a video store where he sold previously viewed videos. And at one time he came home with this box with Sixteen Candles. &quot;Matt, you should watch this.&quot; And I wasn't the most like popular guy in high school. I didn't realize that Farmer Ted was supposed to be a geek. Cause I thought he was so cool. And I felt confident about myself. I just remember wanting every birthday to be delivered with a cake on the table with Jake Ryan, giving me that birthday cake. These theme songs are things that are like, you wanna show your kids. It was my dad's, one of my dad's favorite movies. It was just on television, I think, and I watched it. And I watched it again and again. And again. [CHUCKLES] 'Cause it never gets old, 'cause it's relatable. Everybody just forgets this girl's birthday. And instead of just, &quot;Oh, that's fine, &quot;I'll just have a pity party and make myself &quot;feel better by eating some cookie dough or &quot;something&quot;, which is what they try to make it seem like in movies today, it's, this girl is genuinely really hurt that nobody remembered her birthday. Eh, so even though it's a chick flick I've seen it. That was the movie out of all of them that stayed with me. Sixteen Candles, with Farmer Ted. Where I, that was the first time I saw someone like myself and thought that I was cool. I loved Weird Science, I saw that. But that was my first introduction to Hughes and then from there I surfaced Ferris Bueller's Day Off. And I guess, I related so much to that movie because Ferris was in with like, all the crowds. He wasn't just in with one crowd. I played sports, but, you know, I wasn't the best. I, you know, I was in the drama club. Just really related to this person, who could just bounce from one crowd to the other, seems like... My introduction to John Hughes was actually the movie Ferris Bueller's Day Off. And it was a life changing movie. Um, I think, I've probably wanted to be Ferris Bueller since the moment I saw that film. Even now, if I am at a bar mitzvah and I'm dancing to Twist And Shout I am closing my eyes and I'm thinking, I am Ferris, you know, in the parade. I'd no idea that it would be such an enduring kind of anthem-like film. I really had absolutely no idea. No. ALAN: I found it baffling for a long time. And I felt just like I might as well just wear that red wings jersey for the rest of my life. At the time I did not think this was some, um iconic film that we would be discussing in twenty years time. I just felt pretty frankly it was kind of silly, because it's a, it's a movie about a girl going to a prom. I mean, do people wanna still see this? And you know, clearly I was right. My favorite John Hughes film would have to be Ferris Bueller's Day Off. They had so many different characters. They had the one guy that was cra... Well not really crazy but he was out there so he wanted to do everything, Ferris Beuller. He was a popular guy, who wanted to have fun and there was his nerdy friend who always was like, &quot;We're gonna get into trouble.&quot; I thought that was cool, and then the hot girl that was just there. Not only just there. She still had her personality and she shared her opinion and basically they all clash and they all got along so, so well together. When we talk about these movies my heart's beating faster, I'm getting like, excited about it. And when those kids talk about it they get excited too. But why are the current films, no one gets like really really excited about those movies. You know what I mean? It's a very different like, our hearts are connected to those movies. See, like they say, kids can't look up on the screen and go &quot;Yeah, that's me.&quot; Clerks for me came about because I'd subsisted on a heady diet of big studio movies. And with the exception of the Hughes' stuff never really saw myself reflected on the screen. You know, like, I love the Die Hard movies but I would never, I can't identify with John McClane. You know, I wouldn't shoot somebody, I wouldn't jump off the top of a building, I would never take my fucking shirt off in public. So, how am I supposed to look at that movie and be like, &quot;I am like John McClane.&quot; So, once in a while it's nice to see something where you see yourself reflected. And that's what those Hughes' movies did in the mid '80's. They kinda gave us like a good three or four-year run, where on a Friday night, we can go to the movies and see ourselves up there. After the '80's, I mean I think the teen pop kind of, fluff movie kind of took a dive. I don't even think they're trying anymore, like, I've never had sex with pie but I have skipped school on occasions. I think Hollywood is trying to search for a stereotype of a teenager. And they can't because it's too diverse. Most movies usually, like teenage movies usually revolve around the popular girl or a girl that looks like she could be popular. They're all kind of like plastic. They have no personality to them. They just are fake. What was the most important thing that you learned from a John Hughes film? I don't think I can pick one most important thing, there were so many lessons that he gives. It's gonna be okay, it's okay to be different. I learned how to kiss. I had all these flashbacks of like Pretty In Pink where Eric Stoltz is kissing. [ GLORY PLAYING] ♪ Burning rock ♪ In the palm of your hand ♪ Treat this place As you're wont to ♪ I will make my land ♪ To comfort you ♪ MICHAEL: If somebody can help me out of this. [KARI LAUGHS] KARI: Whoa, whoa. [CLASSIC ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] MATT: Welcome to Chicago. MICHAEL: This windshield, it sucked. [MATT LAUGHS] LENNY: What time is it? KERI: Three thirty. It should be open. KARI: Can you do wake up calls? WOMEN: What do you need a wake up call? Nine? MATT: Nine thirty? KARI: Oh. [BOTH LAUGH] Tail sliding, whatever roll you're on and everything. What's happening, hot stuff? To be honest with you, I never really, eh, did anything with an accent before. And so, I went to a friend of mine, who's Korean and I said, &quot;Can you kind of help me with this? &quot;And try to figure out. Gotta pull this off somehow.&quot; They really though I was from another country and I acted like that, like I didn't understand anything. And I remember that I fooled Jackie, number one and then I told her. And then it was her idea not to tell John. And so I went in there, you know, as the character and I think it was like a couple of days afterwards I called Jackie and I said, &quot;You know, maybe he should know that I'm from Utah.&quot; John didn't really describe the role to me as much. I sort of came in reading Lisa as sort of a Mary Poppins with breasts. I likened her to somebody with magical yet very human like qualities and she had an affection for these boys and she didn't like to see them being hurt. Hello? Showering is real fun, isn't it? Man, you got to kiss Kelly in a bra? And you were in the shower with her. That rocked, you know. It was just not at all that. It was like, okay, you know, everybody's looking at me, she's looking at me. And if I look at her boobs, everybody is gonna see me looking at her boobs. And the kissing was the same thing, like, like over and over and over again. And the only real theme throughout the whole day was that everybody knew she wouldn't be kissing me unless she was getting paid a lot of money. And everybody was looking. It's so like, what the hell was that, you know. When we were casting that, it was down between Anthony Michael Hall and Eric Gurry. He was the hot kid at the time, not Anthony Michael Hall. But then when Eric Gurry came in, he'd done an Al Pacino movie and he was real high energy. And Anthony Michael Hall, when he came in for casting, who is, who I wanted, was shyer, was a little bit, he was funny but it was much more innocent. There's something about that kid. And after he got casted, the relationship that happened between John and Michael is what really bloomed. A naked blonde walks into a barn. I said to John, &quot;Why don't I just be telling a joke &quot;and before I get to the punch line I &quot;fall through the den?&quot; 'cause we don't need a punch line. Make it rain he says. [EXCLAIMS] And we'd already shot my line when I come back down and I go I forgot my pencil. So me and John, Mike and Emelia were trying to go figure out a joke whose punch line would be that. We tried for like about an hour. And then, you know, you can't take that much time. So I do a version of it anyways. So incredibly nasty. It was just, it was X rated, it was, you know, Mel Gibson could have written it. So he goes, &quot;I'll not use that.&quot; I go, &quot;I know, I know. That was just for me. &quot;Let me try one more.&quot; So throw it all together, make it up with some walking through the thing and then fall through the roof. And a lot of times people say, &quot;What's the plot sign?&quot; And I'm just like, &quot;There isn't one.&quot; I was on the set of Breakfast Club. I went up to that high school that he had turned into a studio. And watched them shoot some scenes, and talked to those young actors that day, and talked to John Hughes, who said that one of the reasons that he moved this whole operation to Chicago and use that high school as a studio and he used the gymnasium as a sound stage. Um, it was that, he wanted to get the Brat Pack or the Brat Pack wannabes, out of Los Angeles. Out of the place where they can go out at night and party and go to clubs and see their friends. He wanted them in some crappy motel out by O'Hare, where he could just, kind of control 'em, and bring them to this location every day and make them work. Without all of the distractions of their own lives as young movie stars. ALLY: At different points during the filming, um, come up to each one of us cause at different points there was focused more on one person, and then, um, and, he felt, like, at that point, that one character was him. You know, you're playing me when I was in high school. Um, but he had that with all five. The first part of the first rehearsal he has us all sitting at this one table. And I go, &quot;I'm not sitting here.&quot; And he just goes, &quot;What do you mean?&quot; I go, &quot;I'm not sitting with him in the same table with them. &quot;Why should I sit with them?&quot; &quot;Look, I've been in this room every Saturday. &quot;I don't know what the hell they do. &quot;I'm not sitting with them.&quot; [MUMBLES] And he goes, &quot;Well, where do you wanna... Well, okay. &quot;That's what makes sense to me. Where do you wanna sit.&quot; And I go, &quot;Wherever he sits.&quot; Pointed at Anthony Michael Hall. &quot;What you mean?&quot; I go, &quot;Whatever seat he picks, &quot;that's the one I wanna sit in.&quot; He was willing to go, &quot;Well, I don't know.&quot; It's almost like, it seems like sometimes directors aren't supposed to say they don't know. By the way that clock is twenty minutes fast. JOHN: I did a whole monologue of this, to where they were gonna be like twenty from now, like now. Like in their thirties. I told Judd that he was gonna be, you know, an overdose mental that Molly Ringwald is gonna be in a suburban, you know, soccer mom. Anthony Michael Hall was gonna be a, a big broker, a big jag-off, a big heart attack. And they are all like sitting there and I leave and I've sort of given them a glimpse into the future. I don't want you take me home! Okay, why? What is the problem? Because I don't want you to see where I live, okay? John in no way was married to the, to the words at all. I'd say, &quot;What if &quot;I said that?&quot; And he'd go, &quot;Yeah, that's good. Say that.&quot; Totally, he was not in any way wedded to his words. He was wedded to his, sort of, the feel and &quot;Well, that's seems like it's right. Yes, say that. &quot;Definitely much better, much better, great idea, great idea. &quot;That raises the bar.&quot; He loved to say, &quot;That raises the bar.&quot; HOWARD: John is a director and frankly, I don't think he really ever loved directing. You know, he loved writing. And I think he directed to protect the material on the character. I think that one of the things he would end up doing when he directed. For instance, he told me once in Planes And Trains, Steve Martin had a criticism about some scenes. And I saw John. He told me this, I happened to be there, I saw him go into his trailer. And rewrite the whole scene. Now I could never do that. I would fight with the actor, because I don't have the talent to rewrite the scene. Where John was so open, and available, and as a writer, capable of changing it and adapting it to what that story wanted that he would. It was easier than fighting. He didn't like confrontation. Let's go find John Hughes. That's what we're doing today. Get some breakfast. Maybe a club. Breakfast? Yeah. No, I want a big breakfast for this one. More like a... I want an American breakfast. Denny's breakfast or like an IHOP. Yeah, some buttermilk pancakes. MICHAEL: Buttermilk pancakes. MATT: Sunny side up eggs, bacon. MICHAEL: Eggs, bacon. MICHAEL: I do think that this would be a really good place to start to, to find him. MATT: That's why we're here. I think Starbucks 'cause it's like a local place. Feels like the people around here went to high school with the guy or something. Like, it's like... KARI: The people around here went to high school with... WCCO. I think we should stake out the house. I don't want to start the day banging on his door. I'd like to try and get as much information as we can. Like is he well known in his home town? Do people know who he is. Because this area, I don't think is... I'd love some more coffee, please. Thank you. Yeah, I'm actually enjoying this cup of joe. KARI: It's like, no mater what you're trying to say, that comes out awkward instead of cool. [LAUGHS] Who are you? Archie? Did he do say [MUMBLES] No. I would have thought because of the way He did Breakfast Club, Okay, yeah. Pretty In Pink, Some Kind Of Wonderful Oh, wait. Ferris Beuller's day off. I might have to go with Breakfast Club. They're still in cable, all of them. And you turn 'em on and you keep 'em on. You never change it. Is there anybody in this restaurant right now who would have someone like, have a good understanding of the history of this area? And who might know who he is or where he is? She might. MICHAEL: This lady over here is gonna have some gems, gold mine. We could go anywhere. Did you try the Internet? Okay, great, thank you so much. Do you know him? Oh, I know him, yeah. He did a lighting for... Remember a movie, it wasn't very successful. Jim Belushi, did with a little... Curly Sue. Curly Sue. That was John Hughes' last film. Yeah, so I got out there and I talked to Belushi. As much as I sometimes doubt that when it came down to the person sitting behind us had actually gone to high school with the person who did all the lightings for all the John Hughes films. I was very surprised the first time I received a fan letter from Scandinavia. And so many other cultures that we think are so different from ours. That a movie like Breakfast Club showed them, you know, we had a lot in common. He was about high school. He was about teenagers. It wasn't quite corny. It could have been just funny. But there was this melancholy, that made all of his movies beautiful, aesthetic, sensual and optimistic, hopeful, sad and blue. I know that there are a lot of directors now that really pay great homage to John. Dogma, there's a, you know, big joke in Dogma or really like a, kind of B plot about how the Jay and Bob characters wound up in Illinois was 'cause they were looking for Shermer Illinois as depicted in all the Hughes' movies. Fucking Breakfast Club. All these stupid kids actually show up for detention. Fuckin' &quot;Weird Science&quot;. Where this babe wants to take her gear off and get down but oh no she don't because it's a PG movie. And then &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot; which I can't even watch with this tubby bitch anymore. 'Cause every time it gets to the part where the red head hooks up with her dream guy, she starts to sobber like a little bitch with a skinned knee and shit. The John Hughes films are classic movies and we wanted to pay homage to them because obviously we felt like they've stood the test of time and even today's audience who watches teen movies, you know, still watches them on cable and rents the DVDs. Twenty years ago five teenagers sat divided in a high school library condemned to eight hours of detention with nothing to do, [AUDIENCE CHEERING] but figure out who the hell am I. When were gonna do that thing for MTV, when they spoke to me about it, I said, &quot;Well, you reached Hughes?&quot; And they were like, &quot;No.&quot; Writer┃Director John Hughes' 1985 classic remains an enduring story. Reflecting the good, the bad, and the ugly of teenage wasteland. Tonight we are here not to punish The Breakfast Club but to honor it. To etch it's name into movie awards history and on to our silver bucket of excellence. I go, &quot;Well, &quot;you might wanna at least try. &quot;If you want all of us to show up, &quot;you get him. We'll definitely, &quot;I'll show up. We loved working with him. &quot;He shows up somewhere, we'll be there.&quot; Then the guy was like, &quot;Well, maybe I should do that.&quot; Yeah, yeah, maybe you should. I had no idea that we would be here twenty years later. And it would all still mean so much. And I just wanna really acknowledge somebody that should be here, I wish he was here tonight. Um, John Hughes. You know, without him we wouldn't be here. [AUDIENCE CHEERING] Where are you? Where are you? Where were you? Well, do you know where he is? So we go find him. We have to think about two things. One, we don't want to tip him off. But I do think we need to do a little research before we just ambush his house like mid afternoon lunch time. MATT: I don't like the word ambush. But it isn't an ambush, Matt, he doesn't know we're coming. There's other words better than ambush. Stalking? No. The drop by? Going to his house to tell him, that we like, tell him how much his films mean to people. Here's what we have to remember. We've been living this for two and a half years and we're in it. He has no idea who we are. He doesn't know who we are. He doesn't care. He doesn't wanna talk to people. So the fact that we're coming to his house, which is like his domain, that's a total invasion of privacy. So we're gonna have to handle it very delicately. That's what I am saying it needs to be treated very delicately. 'Cause I don't want him to be like complete invasion of his privacy. KARI: So, yeah. Now I think we do some research, like go to the Starbucks, go wherever, get some information delicately. That again like what Kari was saying is express two things if we even do get to him. Which are, we're doing this because there is a love for him and a demand for him that maybe he's not aware of but we wanna make him aware of it, that's all. Yeah. My only concern is getting to that point. What's our opening without having this man be like, &quot;Get the fuck off my property.&quot; Genuine honesty, why not just go to him and be like John, we've spent, you know, two years of our lives doing this. Doesn't matter. He didn't ask us to. I think we just show up and really like to talk to you. Everyone wants to talk to him. If somebody showed up at my house and was like, &quot;Hey I just wanna talk to you.&quot; I'll be like ,&quot;Well, fucking call me or send me an email.&quot; Don't you show up at my door and do that. These circumstances are different though. You know, for me it's like, if we go to the door and you know, we're very respectful about him. We're like, &quot;Hey, we just wanna talk.&quot; And he says no, well, that reveals a lot about John Hughes as well. That's the inside into the man's... MATT: No, we can't hold that against him. If he's like &quot;Guys get off.&quot; We just wanna deliver you a message. We'd love an interview from you, so, we just wanna give you a little sample of what we've been working on for two and a half years. Hence the fact that we're filming this. LENNY: I though we agreed that we weren't gonna give him a cut of the film. I feel like it's our last chance. This is what I would do. We go far away in our inconspicuous FBI looking van. That would send Kari, with a note. I think the letter's really... I'm getting to it. With a letter and a cut. And if she gets to speak to him for thirty seconds, which is very unlikely. But our best chance of him answering is Kari walking up, &quot;We're here to deliver this to you.&quot; I think he's gonna be receptive to it. If he's home, you should go to the door and anything else is gravy. Do you think like maybe the cripple factor might help? No. If I went with Kari and just... I think one person. Look, if he engages, just walk out. Of course. Yeah, listen we're not stalking a deer here. [ROCK 'N' MUSIC PLAYING] Music was always an important element in John Hughes' films. And now we take it for granted that if we're gonna see any kind of a teen comedy, we're gonna hear a lot of hipster bands and the soundtrack is gonna be very important. If you go back before John Hughes, you realize, you didn't have that in movies very often until then. I think a lot more people learned about Oingo Boingo through seeing weird science. Then what have occurred had they not been in the film at that point. He would take like, Mathew and Allen down to the record store on the weekends and they would buy like five thousand records. Hughes' flicks tend to make pop culture references that are very, very broad. Like, if you're watching, you know, Ferris Beuller's day off and the car takes off over head, over the camera and you're hearing the Star Wars theme. Where Hughes tend to be more specific is the use of music. If You Leave by OMD, it's not like OMD ever broke out after Pretty In Pink and the moment you hear that song on the radio, if you're like me, you're like, &quot;Oh, 1986.&quot; They viewed music as a tool to promote the film. Any film that had anything special about music that wasn't a musical, was because the director loved music. Which is John Hughes. I mean, John Hughes' whole thing was he loved music probably as much as he loved making film. I remember John coming to the set and talking about all this music and stuff that he was gonna put in the movie and find these songs for us. I was just sort of amazed, like... It really did generate a new feeling within the film industry. That you can make a film that could reach a teenage audience like this on such a large level. With the music and the film. His music is incredible. He was, he said he wrote the first script of Breakfast Club in like one weekend. Sitting in a room, listening to music and stuff He was like the first guy, psychedelic first. I don't know if you knew about the psychedelic first. He seemed to know what music most kids in high school were listening to. Then, then like, tonight. What they were gonna go home and what they were gonna play. He knew. He might even have known before they did. The record company at the time came and they said, &quot;There's this movie coming. &quot;To be part of the sound track of this movie &quot;would really put you up. &quot;And at a kind of place where you wanna go.&quot; So we meet with Simple Minds and it's kind of like a lot of tension. Because they don't want to do this. You know, what, they're gonna sing somebody else's song? The producer of what became the song, Keith Forsey, turned up. Saying, &quot;You gotta do my song, it'll be great, &quot;it will be number one and stuff. &quot;I know Billy Idol.&quot; Out of frustration I went into this Jordan Harris' office. I slammed the door and I said, &quot;Look, &quot;you've got to make simple minds do this song. And he said, &quot;Look, what have you got to loose? &quot;Try the song.&quot; Jim said he wanted to redo the lyrics. But you can't redo the chorus. The chorus has to stay. ♪ Don't you ♪ Forget about me ♪ We didn't have an end for the song and we thought, &quot;Well, we'll just break it down.&quot; But I don't have any words, so they took it down, came up with this great, great crescendo and left me with nothing to sing except la-la-la. ♪ La, la, la, la, la ♪ La, la, la ♪ It was the song that was never meant to be. [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] ♪ Ones you love ♪ Are the ones you burn ♪ Being here ♪ Being here ♪ Being here LENNY: Dumb ass, you don't know your north, south, east and west? MATT: Dude, if I go up this way, we're gonna go back to west. Like west is where we have to go. But you're not sure. Just turn right and you're flooring it, basically. That's what I'm trying to explain to you. You don't know where you're going. So I noticed a similarity between a whole bunch of the houses that he uses in his films. National Lampoon's vacation, Sixteen candles European vacation, Christmas vacation, weird science Ferris Beuller's day off, Planes, trains and automobiles Uncle Buck, Home Alone, Home Alone 2 and Home Alone 3. All the houses are nice upper middle class, red brick, or white with black or white shutters. He uses all like the same image of this house in all of these movies. Maybe his house looks... He probably grew up there, man. You ever complement him on anything? Many critics attacked John in his movies. Critics looked at it as here's the latest you know, installment from John Hughes. And I don't thing they were overly cruel, but I don't think they were overly enthusiastic. I just think it was like nice little comedy about some kids running around Chicago. Right now Pete starts by reviewing John Hughes' newest film which is about a kid who takes a day off from school. I was very disappointed by Hughes' new film called Ferris Beuller's Day Off. I definitely think that he deserves a critical reassessment. And I was reading contemporary reviews, of his movies. From, written in between 1982 and 1989. And I was surprised how They treat 'em like they're Rob Shiner movies. They just did not get the respect that I thought they would get. Ferris Beuller doesn't do anything much fun. They attacked them, they ripped them to shreds and they did no respect for them. Now, it's about 25 years later and they talk about the great teen movies. That thing doesn't thrill me and the story would be simple enough to do well. But Matthew Broderick has nothing special to say when he looks her straight in the eye. You know, at the time, had they been a little bit more supportive of those movies, then John perhaps, John would still be here. Working in the system and writing movies. You know, a part of the reason I think that he felt like he didn't want to do it anymore or he had to escape was because of how these critics treated his work. I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I was so tough on you. MICHAEL: You haven't heard of a film maker named John Hughes, have you? Of course. Do you know if he lives around here? Does he live in Lake Forest? Do you know the film director John Hughes, who wrote and directed those films, lives here Have you ever heard anything about him or... Um, the name is really familiar. Hey guys, can I talk to you for one quick sec? Sorry to bother you, we're doing a documentary about a film maker named John Hughes. Have you heard of John Hughes? Yes. Do you remember that he might have moved. Um, I don't know. I just know he lives, like, over there somewhere. BOY: What are you guys doing? KARI: We're creating a documentary. Have you guys ever seen the movie Ferris Beuller's Day Off? EVERYONE: Yes! How did you know about Ferris Beuller's Day Off? [INDISTINCT CHATTER] KARI: Do you guys see if they make movies like Ferris Beuller's Day Off today? BOY 1: Nothing really like with that kind of a story. BOY 2: Not that good of a plot. BOY 1: That's like an amazing plot line. So what are the questions that we have for John Hughes? So, questions for John if we're sitting in his family room chatting. Eh, we have, why did you leave? Will you ever come back? Do you know how much you're missed? How much of your life ended up in these films? We know what you thought of the films that came before you made teen films. What do you think of the films that came after? We've asked the teens to give a message to you. What is your message to the teens? I think we should all just in our own head have something that we would wanna say to him personally. We're gonna go to an Italian restaurant called Ferentinos, a pizza place where apparently John Hughes orders pizza from. Let's see what kind of information we can dig up. Let's go. MATT: So we hear this is the best place to get some pizza. MICHAEL: We also heard something else. MATT: John Hughes comes by and orders pizza, yeah? MAN: He was in here, let me see, last week. MATT: Last week? MICHAEL: Last week? Sometimes it's like twice a week or so. KARI: We're actually heading over to his house soon. So we'd love to order a pizza to give it to him. Oh, okay, all right, no problem. KARI: His usual order. MAN: He orders like a medium thin cheese. MICHEAL: Yeah, maybe the address, I don't know. MAN: If you guys got a minute I could... Do you guys have his address? MAN: I can't really give it. KARI: No, no, no, yeah. KARI: Well, we have it. We do. MAN: Let me eh, go get this order, okay? MICHAEL: Okay, cool. MAN: Everyone together here? KARI: Yeah. MICHAEL: He might be calling him to be like there's eight guys showing up at my pizza place. MATT: That is possible. MICHAEL: That is totally possible. MATT: We're hot on his scent. That's for sure. [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] MICHAEL: This is it, guys. Wait, hold on. Just keep going Matt. See. WOMAN: We definitely passed that house. That was only the second one. KARI: This one? WOMAN: Yeah. MICHAEL: So let's make another pass of the house just so that we know exactly. I think that Lenny was right, I think it was the second house. KARI: Yeah, I think it was the one on the corner. MATT: I think it's this one right here. KARI: Yeah. MICHAEL: Yeah, this is it. Yeah. MICHAEL: Let's park it right here. KARI: No, no, no. MICHAEL: Pull up into the island here. And let's just get our bearing and get out. So we should walk to the house, we'll stay out of the view, you go in with the pizza. KARI: I feel like we almost should forget the pizza. MICHAEL: No, bring the pizza. LENNY: I guess that ambushes hates the Portinos guy. KARI: It does. I don't want to do it. LENNY: And then he'll think the portino's guy gave the address. MATT: Yeah, yeah, I agree, I agree. It's not worth it. Oh, that's cool. All right. MICHAEL: This maybe too close. Let's get out of the van. MICHAEL: Drop your purse, forget about anything that's going on. LENNY: If Kari's going up there to say, &quot;I'm not filming.&quot; And he's not a stupid guy. Why don't we just have her go up first. KARI: Because if he says no, then we wont use it. MICHAEL: Do you think it's worth having her go up first? LENNY: Because if she says, &quot;No, I'm not filming.&quot; and he sees the laugh, that could be the deal breaker right there. If he says, &quot;Are you filming &quot;it?&quot; She'll say, &quot;Yes.&quot; LENNY: Okay good. That's all I'm saying. We have to follow Kari up to the house though right? LENNY: We'll stay off the property. MICHAEL AND LENNY: Yeah. Let's just go and see what happens. MICHAEL: Let's just walk up and stand outside there at the driveway. He wants the camera off, we'll turn it off. Let him see your eyes though, take the shades off. KARI: I will, I will. No, no, no, shades out all the way out. Are you guys going in the van 'cause we can... MICHAEL: No, we're gonna walk by. But we're going to hide. We're gonna sort of stay in the back bushes. Look, the camera is there. It's all good. Hold on, hold on, hold on. Quick, quick, quick. Let's go. Hands in. Two and half years. MATT: Two and a half years right here. MICHAEL: John Hughes. KARI: Please say yes. MICHAEL: Please say yes. Here we go. MATT: Please say yes. LENNY: Please be home. MICHAEL: All right, one, two, three. [EXCLAIMS] Let's go. You got this, Kari. KARI: What am I saying? [CHUCKLES] KARI: Guys, you should stay. Fall back. MICHAEL: Lenny, we've come this far. We can't go back. Go. Focus. WOMAN: Hello. KARI: Hi, yes, I have a message for John Hughes. Hi, John, I'm Jason Reitman. You have no idea who I am. Eh, however, I grew up watching your films and I'm a die hard fan of Ferris Beuller. Give me a call, John. I love that film. Thank you for making that film. Hi, John. I hope you're well. Thanks for everything. For me it's kind of a cinematic expression of pure joy. Well, I just hope he's well. You know. I can't help it, there's something delicious about the way you feel at the end of that film. The way you feel when Ferris starts dancing. And I hope to god, you make another movie that makes me feel that way again. Thank you so much. [CHUCKLES] You're a God to us. Yes! Thank you. I would be loved to be involved in anything he does. You know, and a lot of people would. Thank you for Kelly Le Brock. I think I would put in a call to John Hughes and see what he's up to. And see if he has any screenplays in his desk drawer that he would like for me to read. My message to John Hughes would be, &quot;Thank you very much for actually making &quot;movies that portray how teenagers really are &quot;rather than glamorizing their problem.&quot; I miss you very much. I'm tired of talking to you in my mind. You know, I'd like to talk to you in person. [SMIRKS] I'm so sorry for being such a, a kind of a jerk on that movie and I wish you well and I'm very grateful for having been in that movie. There's a void that you left whether you like it or not. I think that you should have a say in every single teen movie that comes out today. They need your guidance, John. Without you I wouldn't have made Clerks, Mallrats and all that shit that I've done. So, if you hate those movies, you have no one but yourself to blame. I can come to Chicago. I know where Chicago is. It's a windy city. I can get there. Come on, it's probably you and just Cusack hanging out all the time. That's not right. Find someone, find a prodigy and you know, like lead them, show them your ways. Help them to come and talk to us. And do an interview every once in a while, for God's sake. I'm built like a table, all leg and no movement. I can't play any sports and thanks to you, you made that cool. EVERYONE: Come back, John Hughes. Come back, do anything. Write, direct, produce, it doesn't matter. Come back and save teenage films, please. WOMEN: Okay, hold on just a minute. Thank you. I have a package for Mr. Hughes. WOMAN: Oh, no, he's not eh, I mean, he's not home. KARI: He's not home, okay. KARI: Um, you know what, maybe I'll come back later so I can out it in a proper envelope. KARI: So I was just gonna talk to him. WOMEN: Oh, okay. Yeah. WOMAN: He's not home right now. KARI: Okay, thank you. WOMAN: All right. So I don't know if he is home and she's just covering for him. But he could be like watching from that window and we're standing here with a fucking camera crew. So, I think we should write the letter and just drop it off. MATT: Yes. KARI: I said I was gonna do that. MICHAEL: Oh, no, somebody's in the window, look. MATT: No, don't. No. No, it's okay. KARI: No, it's okay. KARI: Where's he going? LENNY: That's just like, peeping through windows. KARI: Get Facc over here. Facc! Facc! Just saw somebody in the window. I feel like, maybe if I went up to the door. I don't know, like... KARI: Get Facc over here. Perfect, we get another chance. LENNY: I think the letter should just be, &quot;To John, MATT: &quot;To John, where have you gone?&quot; KARI: No, we, you know, &quot;We're sorry for your intruso.&quot; MATT: The letter should be short, it should be heart felt. I think it should end with each one of us LENNY: No. KARI: No, it's so lame, Matt. LENNY: All right, Matt? A real letter to him. KARI: I think we should just be who we are and not try and imitate him. KARI: Okay let's hit the letter. Okay, let's hit the letter. Let's write it here. Right here, now. Kari comes back, We'll stay back more I guess. KARI: And at the end of the letter say, &quot;We would love to interview you, we are in Northbrook for a day. &quot;Please call us if you're willing to talk to us &quot;on or off camera. &quot;We just wanna meet you after two and a half years of &quot;getting to know you.&quot; &quot;Dear John,&quot; MICHAEL:&quot; Dear john.&quot; MATT: &quot;Dear john.&quot; &quot;We're sorry if we're intruding in your personal space MICHAEL: &quot;We're independent documentary film makers.&quot; LENNY: Wait, please. LENNY: Please wait. I can't... MICHAEL: All right. LENNY: So what's the first line? &quot;Dear John, &quot;sorry for the unexpected intrusion.&quot; You know, whatever you wanna call it. MATT: &quot;We've spent the last KARI: &quot;two and a half years making a documentary &quot;about the impact that your films have had MATT: &quot;on an audience that KARI: &quot;spans over three generations.&quot; Does that make sense? &quot;Well, for the last two and a half years&quot; KARI: We've already said that. MICHAEL: We have? Okay, read it out loud. MATT: &quot;Dear John, sorry for the unexpected drop in.&quot; KARI: &quot;We're here for a day. If you can reach out to us &quot;in any way, we'd love to just speak to you.&quot; MATT: Comma. KARI: &quot;We understand KARI: &quot;and respect your privacy.&quot; MATT: Yeah. LENNY: Somewhat. KARI: &quot;Here is our last cut. &quot;Here is a rough cut. KARI: &quot;of our documentary. KARI: Make rough in caps. MATT: &quot;If you would sit down with us, &quot;we would be grateful. Should we say that like, &quot;We miss you.&quot;? MICHAEL: Yes, yes, no I think we should. KARI: No. KARI: It's 'cause I don't think he's gonna respond to cheese. MATT: This is a strong ending though. &quot;We're here until tomorrow, if you'd sit down with us &quot;that would complete our film.&quot; Thank you. The Don't You Forget About Me team. KARI: That's it, yeah. MICHAEL: Yeah. Thank you, John. Good letter. Good letter. Organic. Good letter, organic and you know what? MICHAEL: Let's just stay here this time. Let Kari go, try again. Give him the letter. See, I'm glad you thought of that. LENNY: Go, Kari. MICHAEL: Go, Kari. Go get 'em. Hey, I'm feeling good. I'm feeling good. LENNY: Who wants a slice of pizza? [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] KARI: So six weeks later after the road trip, we were waiting for a response and kind of never thought we'd get one. Do you think there's something in there. What do you think is in there? If he actually went to the truck, he didn't toss it in the garbage, like-- I think he called his lawyer [CHUCKLES] and his lawyer said send it back. In my heart of hearts, you know, I'm, I I hope that there's a letter saying, &quot;Watching, good job guys.&quot; But, I just, I just don't think there is... I think it''s the DVD and, maybe, I don't know. I just think it's the DVD. I'm gonna believe that he watched it. KARI: Just open it. LENNY: Just open the freaking baggage. MATT: Hand written letter, hand written envelope. LENNY: No, it's just an address. MATT: But the could be Hughes' handwriting. KARI: no, no, no. You don't need to test anymore. We're opening it right now. MATT: Our letter. It's our letter. LENNY: Maybe he wrote... LENNY: So, I think it's safe to say we're not getting an interview. It can still happen. MATT: I've been, really been trying to find out why he's hiding. I think it's more about us like, viewing like, validated that everyone feels the same way that we do. KARI: And it is self indulgent on everyone's heart. And everyone says, &quot;Oh, when I have enough, &quot;when I have enough. But we never have enough.&quot; LENNY: There's no mystery maybe, like maybe it's just he made amazing movies and now he's happy,. KARI: Enjoying his life. LENNY: I think there's no other film maker that's been so influential on not only film making but like people. I know it's a big statement but, like, I swear, I think that a 100%. So is our message really that we want you to come back. KARI: No, our message is thank you and enjoy. You deserve it. MICHAEL: But we want him to come back. We do. KARI: No. [CHUCKLES] MICHAEL: But I do. I do want him to come back.
