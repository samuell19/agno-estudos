Mariners be advised, a violent storm is converging on the northern and central california coast with winds up to hurricane force. Coast guard base monterey, come in. Come in. There's no power! The pumps don't work! Mayday! Mayday! We're sinking! Mayday! Rick! Rick! Jason! When you're fighting for your life, you've got to have a reason to keep going. You've got to love someone or something so much that you refuse to give up. I found my reason after our boat sank to the bottom of the pacific ocean. ♪ Jump, hey, girl ♪ come on ♪ come on around here ♪ that's better ♪ what you want, girl? ♪ There's a party over here ♪ uh-huh, yeah look out.

Debbie, give him the cheapest thing on tap. Nothing for me. So tell me about this proposal of yours. Ok. How would you like to make good money on a beautiful boat with a killer crew? This guy i sailed with last year, rick foster, he's bringing a 68-foot irwin up to vancouver next week, ok? It's a private gig. He's delivering it to the owner. We need a crew. We... matt, i don't know. Come on. It'd be a blast. It sounds great. I'm sure we'd have fun. But you know i've given up sailing for a while. Now, that's the most tragic thing i've heard all day. Hey, hey, hey. Rick foster. Pleasure to meet you, ms. Clarkson. Nice to meet you. You sneak. You planned this, didn't you? Guilty as charged. Plan was to ambush you. Now, tell me why you're landlocked. Bunch of reasons. I gotta settle down, find a steady job. I understand. It'll only be a couple of weeks. Owner wants the boat in vancouver by the end of the month. I'll pay 500 plus expenses. That sounds great. Excellent. We set sail next week. But i can't. Thanks for the offer. I really wish i could. It was nice to meet you, rick. See you later, matt. Right. I'll call you. Don't worry. We got other people we can go to. Not like her. So, matt, how much of this interest is professional? All of it. All right. Well, most of it. Any luck yesterday? Nothing i could handle. $6.00 an hour to give boat rides to tourists just isn't me. Maybe something without boats would be nice for a change. Maybe. Susannah, i, um... uh-oh. Uh-oh what? That's what you used to call me when i was a kid and we were gonna have one of our talks. But i can't help not wanting you to leave again, not yet, not when i feel like we're finally starting to talk. I'm not leaving. In fact, i just turned down an offer to sail a 68-footer up the coast. I worry so much when you're out there. I just wish your father hadn't made you... he didn't make me love the ocean. I just always have. It's like i never had a choice. Such a nomadic lifestyle. Constantly moving, changing friends. I never know where you are, whether you're safe. Mom, stop pushing. Guess who. Someone who won't take no for an answer. Come on. You're gonna take the rest of the day off. It's 10:20. The day hasn't even started. Well, all the more reason to take advantage of it. No, i can't. I have to find a job. Come on. No, really, i can't. I can't. So why is your mother so dead set against sailing? My dad was a sailor. Not sailboat racing. You know, shipyard stuff. He left when i was 10, took a job on some oil rig, and that was that. Wow. I'm sorry. It's ok. It was years ago. So why are you taking this gig? All i want to do is build my racing boat, and that's why i'm taking this job with rick. That's why i take all my jobs. Well, good luck. Thank you. Wow. She's a beauty, huh? Go on. Go for it. Rick wants to show you around. Keep an open mind. Not too shabby, huh? It's an irwin. Beautiful craftsmanship. And she's certainly got all the toys. So, when did you do the whitbread? Um, halfway through my sophomore year of college. Around the world. All the way. Wow. Ha. Welcome to "no sweat" sailing. Go on. Take a look around. ♪ It's gonna take a lot to satisfy me... ♪ um, hello? Hi. Who are you? Susan clarkson. I'm a friend of matt's. Oh, right. You must be that girl that rick's been babbling about. You won the white bread or something. I'm allie. So are you on the crew? No. The only thing i do on a boat is tan. Rick's my boyfriend. I'm just along for the ride. I thought i'd be the only woman on board, but... no, i'm not going. Oh, well. Guess i'll just have to handle those boys on my own. Nice to meet you, susan. See you later. I'm telling you, it'll be fine. And i'm telling you, why do not have enough time. What, you wanna be the skipper now, make all the big decisions? Of course not, rick. I just think you're pushing it here, ok? And i don't... susan. Hey. Hey. How'd it go? What'd you think? I just met your, um... allie. Oh, yeah? She's kind of high maintenance. Amazing, though. Kind of high maintenance? What are you guys talking about? Nothing, just business. So, anyway, susan, i don't like to beg, but we could really use you on this trip. Yeah. I know you want to stay dry for a while, but we just found out that we have less time to make vancouver than rick thought. We need experienced crew like you. I wish i could, really, but i promised... who, your boyfriend? My mother. Oh. She's trying to make up for lost time, and i told her i'd hang around for a while. Just 8 days, susan. 8 days. I'll pay you 750 all in advance. Why are you so anxious? Well, the truth... um, i messed up on my last job. I mean... messed up. There's no need for detail. I was going through a hard time, let a few things slide, and my reputation sank. I need this one to re-establish myself. I'm a good captain with dozens of successful runs under my belt, susan. My goal is to, uh... is to deliver early. Permission to come aboard! Aye, aye, matey. Jason, my man. How are ya? Good. You know matt. Hey. And susan clarkson. Susan. Oh, i didn't know you were gonna be here. Jason, how's it going? Good. Take it you two know each other. Yeah. Well, kind of. We grew up in the same town. Small world, huh? Yeah, i guess it is. So you gonna be crewing up with us? I don't know. Maybe. There's nothing worse than looking for a job you don't want. Sailing's all i cared about. Everything my mother hated about it, i loved. Maybe that was part of the attraction. Why don't you just get rid of those? Because i like to know i'm stronger than they are. You're just making it harder on yourself. You know what they say? You should remove the temptation. They don't live my life. I do. It's up to me. And you know how proud i am of you. I mean, 6 months sober is huge. But? But it's hard to just... forget. I'm trying. I really am. For so many years, i mean... i came home not knowing what to expect. Would you be drunk, angry, irrational, passed out... or my mother? All i can say is it was a very different time. I counted on your father to take care of me, and when he didn't... my world fell apart. And then i turned around and did the same thing to you. And no matter how long it takes, i'm determined to prove to you that things have truly changed. I hope they have. There's something else. Isn't there? Yeah, there is. How would you feel if... if i went away for just 2 weeks? Look, mom... susan. I know i said we would stick around and we could work things out. We will. I promise. Mom... it's only a couple of weeks. Just tell me one thing. What has changed since this morning? Nothing. Nothing's changed. It's just... i need to go do this. Please. You'll call me every day? All right, all right. Every other day. That's the best i can do. Deal. ♪ Every day is a brand-new start... ♪ come on. You gotta name all 7. Ok, don't tell me. Uh... sleepy, sneezy, doc... oh. Yeah, now i remember. Dopey. Oh, very funny. Very funny. Aah! Aah! Aah! Hey, i'm getting wet. On a boat? Impossible. Hey, susan, could you hand me that vise grip there? This thing's all goofed up. Sure. Here you go. Thanks. Looks good.

See you later. Come on, susan. Kick off your shoes. Dance a little. All right. Let's see if you can keep up. Hello? Don't block my sun. Sorry. So what's the stor with you and jason? No story. Let me guess. Puppy love gone to the dogs. I don't mean to sound rude, but it's really none of your business. Ooh. Touchy, touchy. Must have been a really bad breakup. Either that or he's the one that got away. Look, jason and i are just old friends. We've sailed together, and, yes, we used to be together, but now we're better off as friends. Whatever you say. Hey, could you get me some ice as long as you're headed below? Hmm. Ha. Yes, sir. I know, sir. At the latest. That's right. Yes, you can. You can definitely count on me, sir. I... ♪ i just can't wait for the clock to move its hands ♪ want a refill on that? No, thanks. So what made you do the whitbread? Wanted to see if it was as tough as everyone says. Yeah? Was it?

Aw, he was probably just blowing off steam. We cannot worry about this, ok? I sailed under rick at the fastnet last august. He did a great job. I hope you're right. Hey, guys, we all know if push comes to shove, any one of us could skipper this boat. Well, that's certainly a point. Yeah, so let's not worry about it.

We're gonna hit the dock! Matt! Matt, get up here! I'm here. I'm here. Take the helm. I'm gonna go let the jib out. - Get it out quick! - I am! Get the stern! Hurry, jason! Go! Go! Go! Come on, jason! Watch it! Hey, watch out! Get out of the way! Come on. Too close. Get ready to fend off. Looks like we're gonna make it. Yeah! Whoo. Can you believe that? I thought we were toast. What happened? Impeller went, engine overheated. We're in san pedro. Is everything all right? Great. We're making good time. Good. I'm... i'm sorry i got so angry, susan. I just... i don't know... i hate it when i get like that. I know. So when do you think you'll be back? Depends on what the owner has planned. Can't be soon enough for me. Mom, look, i gotta go. I'll call you from my next stop in 2 days, ok? Take care. I love you. Love you, too. How's mom? Fine, but she worries too much. I didn't tell her how we arrived in san pedro. That should have never happened. Rick should have taken care of that. Did you tell him? Yeah, i told him the impeller shaft was rusty, yeah. Well, that is one of the parts we have waiting here. Rick never said it was urgent. I just figured it was routine upkeep. It wouldn't have mattered if the engine hadn't overheated, really. That's not the point. I mean, rick dropped the ball. How much do we really know about this guy anyway? Look, guys, i've sailed with him, ok? And i've hung out with him at the roost. He seems ok to me. Look, the bottom line is with us crewing for him, he's gonna be fine. No matter what, he's gonna be fine. You're right. We're acting like this is some trip around the world. Come on. We'd better hurry up and get those parts. He wants to shove off right after dinner. I liked college, but i just couldn't help it. I had to get away, sail. I'm sorry, but living on one of these things for 3 years sounds like a living nightmare. And for me, it was a dream come true. You never feel like you're in prison, just totally cut off from reality? No one can tell me what to do here... or pull on me. Someday i want to sail solo across the pacific. Hey, allie, how about making some sandwiches? I'm not hungry. Well, we are. Come on. Help out a little. You do it. I'm on watch. So that makes me the cook? I don't think so, rick. I'll make 'em. No, no. Allie will do it. Forget it. You're part of this crew. It means you work like everybody else. Sleeping with you is plenty of work. You always pull this crap. I swear, allie, you're not gonna ruin this job, too. It is so typical of rick to blame me for getting fired off his last boat. He knew the owner didn't allow drinking on board. What's with you two? You seem so different, i can't figure out why you're together. Rick helped me when i split up with my husband. It got pretty ugly. I didn't know you were married. Yeah. Rick's a sweet guy who loves me and doesn't expect much, and that's just what i need till i get to canada to start over. And he's ok with that? Every relationship doesn't have to be a lifelong commitment. Look. Dolphins. Those aren't dolphins. They're sharks. Mmm. Mmm. I thought you were getting coffee. That's too much trouble. And i thought this was a dry boat. It's just a little whiskey i brought for cold nights. It won't hurt anything. I don't drink when i'm on watch. Oh, and you've never done 60 in a 55? It's not the same. Ahh. Ok. You're right. I'm sorry. Don't mention it to rick, ok? I guess i, uh... i also drink sometimes when i'm nervous. It takes the edge off. What are you nervous about? You. And me. Us. Us? Yeah, you know what i mean. The other night before we left san diego. Yeah, i remember. Look, matt... i like you a lot, but i just can't... it's jason, isn't it? There's a story there. I know it. What? No. I was gonna say i'm wary about getting involved with someone i'm sailing with. Hmm. Didn't seem to be a problem with him. A perfect example of why i'm wary. Hey. I'm sorry. I'm... being a jerk. Give me another chance. Matt, look, i didn't... no, don't... don't worry. You don't have to spell it out, ok? If you want to go off and relight some fire with jason, that's fine. That's fine, really. I gotta go. I gotta go get something. No, matt, look, i don't... it's one afternoon, rick, a couple of hours. Besides, it was 4-1. You lost. As if this were a democracy. Where'd you find this place anyway? Friends of mine and i stumbled across it a few years ago. Owner has a house on the other side, but he's never home. Come on. Hmm? Come on. Take some chances, rick.

Looks like we'll be working harder than we planned. At least it's a short trip. So, matt, matt seems like a nice enough guy, huh? Yeah. He's a little hyper sometimes, but he means well. How long have you known him? A few months, maybe more. How come? Oh, um, i don't know, um... i guess... i guess i remember a time when, uh... when i was the one you were looking at. I'm not looking at matt. I appreciate that, but you don't need to protect me, you know? I already know. Know? I saw you the other night in the cockpit. Well, then you missed the part where i said i just want to be friends. Really? Really. So you two aren't, uh... and you're not... aw, jeez. Aw, susan, that's great. I mean, the minute i saw you, my heart was just like... i mean it was like we weren't even apart. I just kept thinking, maybe this means that we can still, uh... i'm sorry. I mean, that's... that wasn't right. Just because you're not interested in matt doesn't mean... it's not that, jason. Look... i thought about you, too, a lot, but... the reason we broke up... it's still there. The reason i never understood, i remember. I just wasn't ready for what you wanted. All i wanted was... was you, susan. That's it. I know. I wanted that, too, but every time i thought about the future, you know, us being together... i just wasn't ready for that kind of commitment. Yeah. I miss my best friend, though. Me, too. I'm glad you're here. Matt, buddy, what's wrong? Huh? Nothing. Let's just say i'm as anxious to get to vancouver as you are. Hey, matt. Grab some rest. Me and susan are up for the night shift. Yeah. I bet you are. What's that supposed to mean? Nothing. Stay outta my face, ok? Is this about susan? 'Cause if it is, you're way off, matt. This is... we're just trying to patch up an old friendship, ok? That's it. Ha. Well, if that's what you really think, jason, you're dumber than i thought. Look, we got a long way to go, matt. Ok? Let's just forget about this. Let's just... let's just drop it. All right? Are we cool? Yeah, we're cool. All right. Just stay outta my face. Something wrong? Well, barometer's dropping, which usually means a storm's coming, but the weather service predicted clear skies, plus i can't find this one chart. You mean we're lost? No. We're not lost. I just... i was wondering how much time we could save by skipping our pit stop at morro bay. Hey... don't put so much pressure on yourself, ok? Not everything is riding on this one job. Yeah, i know. Don't worry, ok? I'm fine. It's all gonna be... fine. Come on. Where'd all this weather come from? Don't know. Last report said conditions were supposed to be good. Heh. That's our tax dollars hard at work. Maybe we should stay in morro bay until we see what this turns into. We're not going to morro bay. We passed the channel about an hour ago. We what? Why? 'Cause i made a decision based on the reports. I had no idea we were getting into this. A violent storm is battering the northern california coast. Tv 8 has just received word that winds up to 70 miles per hour and waves cresting at 30 feet are causing widespread damage from monterey bay to san francisco... sitting at home with mom is sounding pretty good right now. Oh, yeah. This rigging's too loose. All this jibing's gonna snap a mast. Roll in the jib and take down half the main. Yeah. God, i hate this stupid rig. We need some help. I guess you should go get matt. Go. Matt, wake up. Come on, wake up. I think he passed out. Perfect. We're up there fighting a gale, and he's drinking? It's pretty rough out, isn't it? How would you know? You've been down here all night. Look, i didn't mean it, ok? I'm just wiped out. Aah! You ok? Yeah. Man, what's going on? We need your help up on deck. Can't handle a little foul weather? Give me a clue, matt. You gonna be a jerk all night, or are you gonna come up and help? Somebody get up here fast! Rick! Rick, we need you. What happened? We're trying to reduce the sail. The rig is jammed. Ok. Allie, put some gear on. Take it down. I'm gonna reduce the sail. Ok. Fasten your safety line. I'm trying to reef the main, but it's bound off! Rick! Ohh! Rick, hang on! Hang on, rick! Rick, are you ok? I'm all right! Allie, what are you doing? I want to help. It's too dangerous. Get below. No. Far enough! Hold it there! Hold on! Jason! Jason, are you hurt? No, i'm... i'm all right. Need help on the stern. Make sure you fasten your safety line. Secure the lines and clear the deck! Ok! Aah! Ohh! Allie! Rick! Rick, allie's hurt! She's on the stern! Ok, i'm coming! Allie, i'm here. You ok? Baby, what happened? I was trying to help. You shouldn't have been up here. I know. I hit my back. It really hurts. We got to get allie to a hospital. We'll never make it in this storm. Rick, please, the coast is deadly. We've got to move away from land, not closer in. Look at the chart. I can't. I can't find them. Somebody lost them. You're kidding! No. I wish i was. This is crazy... look out! All right, that's it. That's it. We're going in. I'll put in a call to the coast guard. You guys bring her down. Ok. Come on. Come here. Watch your back. Oww... i got you. We've lost our charts. Can you assist us? Over. "Sea-brook," i need your position. What are your coordinates? Over. Ok, coast guard. Um, my coordinates are 35 degrees, 33 minutes by 121 degrees, 29 minutes. Copy that, "sea-brook." Got it. Wait. We're showing your position to be morro bay. Over. Uh... uh, that's right, coast guard. That was my last position. My mistake. I feel horrible about allie. Aw, she shouldn't have been up here. She wouldn't have been up here if it wasn't for me. I was yelling at her for not helping out. It's my fault. All right! The coast guard says san simeon's our closest dock. Rick wants us to change the heading to 300 degrees. That's a bad idea, matt. We'll be broadside to the waves. We'll risk... nobody asked you. Just do it, susan. Matt, we're gonna be swamped. Matt, you're not thinking. You don't know what you're say... change course now! No, i won't. It's suicide! My god, matt, you're jeopardizing all of our lives! You're both relieved of your duties effective immediately! You and rick can't handle this boat by yourselves in this storm. Aw, forget it. He'd rather kill us all than look weak. If you don't get down below, i'll drag you down myself! No. No. I am staying here to help... matt, stop it... aah! Jason! Jason! Oh! No! No, jason! Jason! That's enough. Stop it! Jason! Jason! Aah! Jason! Jason! What happened? I didn't mean to. What happened, susan? They had a fight. Jason went over. Jason! Jason! Jason! Jason! Where is he? Susan, it's too late. He's gone. No! Don't say that. Jason! Jason! Jason! Jason! Jason! Please, where are you? There he is! Jason, over here! Swim for it! Grab it! Grab the line! Hold on! Pull, pull. Help me. Hang on! Jason, please! Hold on! Hold on! Ok, come on. Pull! Pull! Pull! We got ya! Come on! Come on! Come on. Yeah! Hey, how ya doing? I'm ok. Is jason all right? Yeah. He's fine. Looks like it hurts. Uhh... only when the boat moves. Here. This should cushion the bumps. Thanks. So how are you guys doing up there? It's tough, but we're hanging in there. It's bad, isn't it? "Sea-brook" can handle it. Yeah, but can rick? I guess i really don't know what kind of captain he is. He's doing fine. Don't worry. All this pounding, it feels like we're just falling apart. I'm gonna go back up, ok? "Sea-brook," "sea-brook," request to know your situation. Over. Uh, roger, coast guard. This is "sea-brook." Um... my radar shows the storm moving west. I think we're gonna be ok. Seas are pretty rough out here, but i think we're gonna make it. We're heading into san simeon. Over. Roger, "sea-brook." Glad to know you're ok. Coast guard out. Roger. "Sea-brook" out. Will you file that report? Come on, baby. Oh... shee... man, the owner's gonna have rick's hide. Well, at least she's still floating. Jason... i was so scared when... i know. Thank you. No. No, not again! Oh, man. Check the engine, rick. Check the engine! We need more sail. Ok. I'll go let her out. Can you hold her? Yup. Careful, susan. Ease her out slow. I'm trying. Slowly... i can't clear it. Aah! Jason! Help me! Susan! Jason! All right. Hold on. Hold on. I got you. All right, don't let go. Pick your feet up. I can't. You can. Come on. There you go. Come on, it's all right. I got you. I got you. Hang on to me. Get up. Ok. All right. I'm ok. I'll finish loading up the main. No, no. No, forget it. The storm's too big. If we can't fix the engine, we gotta call for help. You all right? Yeah. Huh? You ok? Yeah. Rick, what are you doing? You're supposed to be fixing the engine, remember? Could you fix the mainsail? I couldn't free it. That seals it. We're done for. Rick, what about the engine? Forget it. We're screwed. Rick, get off your ass and start acting like a captain. Radio the coast guard for help. The storm, i think it's moving west. The hell it is. We're right in the middle of it. If i call the coast guard... i'll never work again. What? You're sitting here thinking about your career? Rick, we're in trouble, big trouble. We've got to call the coast guard and pray we can hold on till they get here. What was the name of the vessel, ma'am? The "sea-brook." It's sailing up to vancouver. I'm afraid it may be caught in this storm. Uh, ma'am, we are very busy right now. But i'll see if i can raise them on the radio. Call us back in an hour, ok? Please. It's... it's my daughter. We're gonna do our best. I promise. Lieutenant, i just saw a report on the "sea-brook." It seems they called in and said they were safely en route to san simeon. Good. Coast guard? Coast guard, come in. Rick, i cannot hold her alone! Aah! Oh, my god. Jason, start the pumps! I can't get up! Matt! Matt, we need you! Help allie. I'm getting the life raft. Come on, we gotta go! Aah! There's no power. The pumps won't work. Mayday! Mayday! It hurts to walk! I'm popping the raft. Abandon ship! We're sinking! Mayday! Stay right here. I gotta launch the zodiac. Aah! No! Uh... uh... jason, let's get outta here! We're goin' down! Aah! Aah! Aah! Help! Somebody help me! Aah! It's ok, allie. Hold on... hold on. Ok, you're free. Swim away from the boat. Hurry! Jason! Allie! Jason! Susan, over here! Over here! Where's allie and jason? I don't know. Allie! Jason! Allie! Jason! Rick... rick! Over here, matt! Over here! Over here! Over here, matt! Rick! Ohh... you ok, baby? My legs hurt. Hold on! Where's jason? I don't know. What happened to the other raft? I couldn't hold on to it. Jason! What do you mean, you couldn't hold on to it? That had all our emergency supplies. We're in the middle of a storm here, remember? We're dead without that stuff. Stop it! It's over! It's all over! Shut up, rick! Shut up! Jason! I can't hold on. Hold on, baby. Just hold on. Let's flip the zodiac and get in. Ok. We'll take the back. You take the bow. All right. That's a good idea. Ok, you ready? Hold on, baby. Hold on. 1... 2... 3! Come on, baby, swim! I can't... you can do it! Jason, thank god! I got caught. I got dragged under. Ok, we got to flip this and get in. It'll blow away again! We'll grab the line over the leeward side and let the wind turn it over. All right, let's do it. Go! Go! Out of the way! Go to the other side, allie! Get ready to pull! Ok. I'm ready. Go ahead. All right... aah! Give me your hand! Here! Give me it! Oh, my god... your legs. It was the rigging. This wind is so cold. It's killing me. I'm telling you, we're better off in the water. He's right. We should get back in. No! I can't. Maybe if we bunch up... conserve body heat. It's too cold out here. Please don't make me get back in. Ok. We won't. Let's just stay close. It's over. I just know it's over. Oh, shut up! Come on, guys, we have to work together. It's our only hope until we get rescued. Somebody must have heard your mayday. They're not coming. Stop saying that! No, i mean, they're not coming. I told them not to come. What? What? I saw you talking... i mean, before the boat went down. I tried. It was waterlogged by then. Damn! We are gonna die. No. We're gonna survive. In the morning they'll be looking for us. We can certainly hold out till then. There are sharks all through these waters. There's great whites. But we should be safe in here. This is my fault. This is all my fault. When day finally broke, what i saw scared me. Of course, our boat was long gone... resting quietly on the bottom of the pacific ocean. Plus we had no supplies... no food, no water, and no captain. As rick had lost all hope, he had nothing to offer in terms of leadership. Allie was in terrible pain, trying hard to be rong, and matt was edgy and quick-tempered. It was up to me and jason to keep everyone's spirits up. I was scared as hell. We need a cover. Jason... do we have anything to make a canopy? Um... yeah. Um... this will work. Let's set it up, and then we can take turns keeping watch until a ship comes. Hey... get up, guys. Help us ou we're gonna make a canopy. What are you doing? Stop. Don't drink that. It'll make you crazy. A small amount won't hurt. You're better off drinking your own urine. You drink what you want, i'll drink what i want. Here you go, baby. Have a little water. No! Damn it! You little... aah! Stay away! Aah! Get off! Hey, what are you doing?! Oh, man! It's ok. It's ok. I'm fine. It's just my leg hurts so bad. It's ok. It's ok, baby. Oh... oh... what have i done to my beautiful baby? What have i done? I've ruined everything. At least the storm passed. Here comes the sun. I don't think i can stand another night here. This is the last one, allie. We'll be rescued tomorrow. Really? Mm-hmm. Rick, do you think so? We don't need to be rescued. I see shore. Where? Over there. We're off mission bay. We're nowhere near mission bay. Yes, we are. I recognize the buildings. Are... are you sure? Rick, you're seeing things. You've been drinking too much sea water. You're confused. No, no, no. It's there. Come on, buddy, sit down. Sit down. Sit down. Rick... what are you doing? Rick, no! Rick! Rick, no! Come back! Rick, please, don't leave me! I gotta go after him! No, no! It's pitch dark out there. You'd both be lost. It's suicide. I know. Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Aah! Ow! Come on, susan, wake up. Wake up, wake up, wake up. Oh, i think i'm losing it. No, no, you're not. It was just a bad dream, just a bad dream. Ok. I'm ok now. We're all just so hungry and thirsty. It's ok to lean on me a little bit, you know. No, it's not. We have to be strong. You can't be expected to do it for both of us. This is not a competition, susan. What's going on? Nothing, allie. Go back to sleep. I'm just gonna cover you up, ok? No, i don't wanna wake up. Shh. I don't. I don't wanna remember... or feel this pain. And now rick... i don't think he made it. Do you think he made it? No. But we're still here. We're gonna live through this. It just seems so much easier to die now... like he opened the door. Rick didn't die. Allie, he killed himself. Rick gave up when the boat sank, allie. After that, all he cared about was you. I... i don't wanna die. Please don't let me give up. I won't. Don't tell me to wait. My daughter could be lost out there. Listen, i understand your concern, but we have no evidence of any trouble. Now, last we heard, they were headed north. And i am telling you, i know my daughter. I want to talk to the officer in charge. He will be here as soon as he possibly can... i'm lieutenant belwick, ma'am. What seems to be the problem? The trouble is my daughter's boat is missing. Everybody keeps saying her boat is safe, but nobody seems to know where it is. You must be mrs. Clarkson, and yes, last we heard, "sea-brook" was safely on its way to dock in san simeon. It never arrived. She would've called me. I understand, but maybe she just forgot during all the confusion. She didn't forget. Something is wrong. My daughter is in trouble out there, and i am not going to risk her life because you're satisfied that she's safe. Please, come in. Where are my cigarettes? They were right here. What are you talking about? My damn cigarettes. Who took 'em? Ok, guys, i want my cigarettes back right now. They were right here. Matt, they sank with the boat, remember? No. I'm talking about the other cigarettes. What other cigarettes... the ones i bought at the store, man! I bought beer, and i bought... matt! Whoa, matt. If you went to the store... look at me... why did you come back? "Sea-brook." "Sea-brook," come in. Over. The skies have been clear for 2 days. They should be answering. All right. Let's mark their last known coordinates, see if any other vessels are in the area. All stations, this is united states coast guard, los angeles group. Be on the lookout for "sea-brook," a 68-foot, blue-hulled sailing vessel with 5 people on board, last reported 16 miles southwest of morro bay, california. Matt, don't! I'm thirsty! You'll kill yourself. You saw what it did to rick. Leave me alone! I've been drinking it all day! Stop it! Hey, hey, hey... tell her to shut up! It's not her business! Leave him alone, susan. We can't let him kill himself! You can't make him survive if he doesn't want to. Fine. Let him die. I'm sick of fighting with him. Oh... shee... look at this filth. Ugh... it's poison, man. Look at it. Ugh... ugh... matt. We're sitting in poison, man. It's gonna kill us! Matt... no, it won't. We gotta get out of here. No, matt. How? Listen... we gotta dump it out. Flip the raft, dump it out. There's sharks all over the place. You gotta think about this, ok? God, it's burning me. Stop it, matt. Allie's too weak to swim. Turn it over now! We gotta empty it! What's going on? Are we being rescued? No, but we're dying. This water's killing us. Matt, no! No, no... uh... aah! No, jason! Matt, damn you! Come on in! It's perfect! Ah! Something just bumped me. Sharks! Jason, hurry, get in! Kick, allie, kick! Hurry, jason, get in! Move your legs! Move your legs! Come on, help her up. Grab her. I got you, allie. Jason! Matt! No, what are you doing? Get in the raft! Come on! Matt, no! Matt... grab my hand! Help! Get in the raft! Aah! Matt! Matt! Aaaaah! Don't look. Aah! Aah! Aah! She's pretty bad. I think it's blood poisoning. What should we do? A tourniquet around her leg might help stop the infection from spreading. A tourniquet. Um... well... oh, here. Here, use this belt. Listen, allie, i'm worried about your leg, ok? We're gonna put a tourniquet on it, all right? Tourniquet? To help you. Why? All right? It might hurt a little... but it'll stop the infection from spreading, ok? Ow! All right. Just hold still for one second, ok? What are you... oww! Guys, get away from me! All right, all right! Stop! Get off! All right, all right! It's off, it's off. All right. Don't touch me. It's ok, it's ok, it's ok. It's all right. It's over. It's ok, it's ok. I'm just gonna play it real straight with you, mrs. Clarkson... we cannot find any evidence that your daughter's boat ever reached san simeon. And, uh... what are you doing to try to find her? We are checking every harbor and marina up the coast. We have a watch alert out to all vessels in the area. Uh, what about airplanes, helicopters? We're considering that, too. Considering isn't enough, damn it! You just get the hell out there and find her! Point reyes, this is coast guard 1503, on scene, commencing papa-sierra search at minute 0-8. Major axis is 1-3-5 degrees true. Tracking space is 5 miles... ah... ahh... ohh... so hot. There's no breeze. There's no nothing. Let's get in the water and cool off. Come on, susan, come on. No, you can't. No, i have to cool off. Susan, stop it. Come on, stop. Stop! What... what are you doing? Please, you can't... you can't leave me here. We're not going anywhere, allie. Look... look. Ah! Ha ha! I caught one! I caught it! Ha ha ha ha! What's going on? We caught a fish. We got something to eat. Heh heh. Oh... oh. Ok. All right. There. Here. Give some to allie, first. Yeah, yeah. Here, allie. No. Yeah, come on. It'll help. Protein will fight the infection. I can't. Here. Let me try. Come on, allie, just a bite. No. What was that back there? I don't know. I just... i woke up and i just remembered wanting to cool off. Don't worry. It won't happen again. You are determined to go through this alone, aren't you, susan? No, but i pull my own weight... damn it, susan. Haven't you seen enough dying on this raft? We need to help each other, susan. Don't you understand... that it's ok to need each other? I know. Ah! Wake up, wake up. It's raining. Come on, allie, drink. Oh! Ahh! Yes! Oh, no. No. It's time to go. What? Where? Home. Time to go home. Come here, allie. Lie with me. Come on. Shh. It's ok. It's time to go. Allie, can you hear me? What is it? She's slipping away. The lord is my shepherd. I shall not want... i can't tell what she's saying. Maybe she's... yeah... talking to god. Our father, who art in heaven, hallowed by thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread... she would've made it if she hadn't been hurt. She was strong. She didn't deserve to die this way. I can't believe she's gone. She had this in her pocket. Rest in peace, allie. Jason, stop. No, no, let go. It's not what you think. Sorry. I thought you were drinking sea water. I can't stop throwing up. Well, that's... that's a good sign. Your body's getting rid of the toxins. No, not anymore. It just dry heaves now. It hurts. I'm sorry, susan. Sorry? About what? I know how much you hate weakness. I just hate feeling like my life is out of control. Does that make any sense? About as much sense as any of this makes. I'm scared, susan. I'm scared i'm gonna die on this godforsaken raft. Stop it. Don't you dare give up on me, ok? We're gonna live through this. And i'm trying. I'm trying. I'm just, you know... well, try harder. It hurts so bad. Look, we're gonna make it, ok? I need you to try harder. Really? Yeah, really. Did you hear something? When i finally saw the ship, i thought it was a mirage. I was just losing it again. There was no way we were really being rescued. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Ha ha ha ha ha! Ah, ha ha ha! Then i heard jason... and the excitement in his voice, and figured we couldn't both be dreaming. They found a raft. Oh, thank god! They still have to get them both on board. Both? A man? A woman? Who? I don't know for sure. They're on board. Who? Young man... and a young woman. Jason o'donnell... and susan clarkson. Ha ha ha! Thank you! Oh, thank you, thank you! Thank you so much! Ah! Oh... it wasn't until later that i realized what my mom did. Susannah. She refused to give up, and she helped save our lives. I guess, in a way, jason and my mom were both trying to teach me the same thing... there's nothing wrong with needing people. That's what makes us strong, that's what makes us human, and that's why i'm alive today.
