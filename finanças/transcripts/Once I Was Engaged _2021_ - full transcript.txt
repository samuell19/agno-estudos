♪ Hey everybody, it's family night ♪ ♪ We better take the phone off the hook ♪ Family home evening was huge in my home. I know most members of the church keep it pretty chill with movie night or game night, if you know Carrie Carrington, she has no interest in being chill. So we went all out. Like clockwork, every Monday night, we got together to plan our week, share a spiritual lesson and of course, eat lots of treats. But of all those 936 Monday nights in the first 18 years of my life, there was one lesson that stuck out to me the most, eternal marriage. My friends from school used to ask, why our temples look like Disney castle? What can I say? Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are obsessed with marriage in a good way of course. I don't know what made me more nervous, getting down on one knee or asking grandpa Robert for permission. Oh come on, it wasn't that bad. I couldn't get him alone. And then one day, I had him cornered while shoveling snow and instantly like a switch, my lips went numb. Thought they were going to fall off. Your lips fell off? Yeah, almost. Why were you so nervous? You knew I was gonna say yes. I mean as long as you didn't ask me in front of a billion people. Oh no, you made that perfectly clear. That goes for you boys too, never ask a girl to marry you in public. It's very uncouth. How can you ever be sure that you wanna spend the rest of your life with someone? Heavenly father tells you it, dummy. Tyler said the D word. Tyler, not the D word, buddy. Well I'm right, aren't I? Yes and no. We prayed about it and it felt like the right thing to do, but the rest was on us, our commitment. Part of what makes it makes it right between two people is because they choose for it to be right and then they commit themselves to that choice. We prepare for marriage our whole lives. So it's a lot of pressure. Best decision of my life. Well it better be. - Ewe. - Oh come on, it's not that bad. Oh, who wants treats? - Me, me, yes. - Oh me. Hey, hey, line up. Come on, we're not animals. Seeing the example of how much my parents loved each other always made me excited for the day I would meet the man that would propose to me, the man I would be with forever. One Sunday when I about 13, we did this activity in Young Women's that really made me think. Maybe you've heard of this. All right girls, settled down. Sister Valentine is going to give each of you a piece of paper and an envelope because you're each going to be writing a letter. Can we just text it instead? No, Hannah, you have to actually write it down. My dad says texting's a terrestrial form of communication. No one cares, Mykelle. - Guys. - Okay, can we all focus? This is no ordinary letter because it will be addressed to you. Not that you of today, but the you in the future on the day of your wedding. I've actually been thinking a lot about this. - Of course you have. - I know this is subject to change, but I currently have zero interest in the inferior gender. So what am I supposed to write about? Well maybe you could write down the attributes that you want in your future spouse. How do you spell anesthesiologist? Good one, Paige. Can we put that he has to be super hot, like brother Carrington? - Charlotte. - You can put whatever you want. These letters are just for you, you're not turning them in. But we do want you to focus on inner attributes and not just what's on the outside. What advice would you give to your future self? What qualities are important to you in a healthy marriage? Really put some thought into it. Choosing who you wanna marry is also choosing who you wanna be. Use it as a guide for the type of person you wanna date. I want you to hold on to these letters, keep them in a safe place. You may wanna refer to them over the next few years. Bree honey, it's your turn to set the table. I'll be right down. As excited as I was to write that letter, for some reason, I kind of forgot about it. I put it in my hope chest, but never really looked at it again, that is until my wedding day. Anyone who knows me knows it was my absolute dream to go to BYU, but not to the Provo campus. And no, I don't mean BYU, Idaho, either. You can't even wear sandals there. I meant BYU, Hawaii. I feel like if Brigham Young would have seen how beautiful Oahu is, he would have said, actually, this is the place. Oh my gosh, look, a whale. I lived in the best house with the best roommates and my new college bestie, Leilani, that's her with the camera. And what better place to pursue my lifelong dream of becoming a Marine biologist? The professors are amazing and the program is top notch. I couldn't imagine going anywhere else. We studied hard and we played hard too. And I might have found myself a boyfriend. Not him, gross. Nope, still not him. Him, Thys Abner Chesterfield. I know, right? Only the most sought after man at BYU, Hawaii. He just got back from his mission in Thailand last fall. He's super smart, athletic and amazing at games, like freakishly. I mean he could totally be on college jeopardy if he wanted, he's just started taking the test. We got to know each other in a real organic way because he was waiting for his high school girlfriend to get back from her mission and I was about to leave on my mission. We both knew we had to break up at the end of the semester, but he was a really good guy and a really good kisser. So it wasn't going to be easy. Gosh, I love Hawaii. And then on Saturday, Thys took me to hike the Ka'au Crater. Mom, there are so many waterfalls and the crater is huge, you and dad would have loved it. Seems like you're spending a lot of time with this Thys fellow. That's why it's gonna be so hard to break up with him. Oh don't think about it as breaking up. Think about it as supporting each other's dreams. Yeah, I like that. And it's true, I mean you’ll always hold a really special place in your heart for him. But it's okay because now that my papers are in, I can look forward to getting my mission call. Wait, what did you say? I submitted my papers this morning. Oh! I thought you were gonna wait till Christmas break. I know, but then I got the most inspiring email from Paige and I just figured, you know, why wait? Like the sooner I send them in, the sooner I can get out there and serve. Oh honey, I am so excited for you. Where do you think you're gonna go? I don't know, but I really hope I get to learn a language. Oh, don't say that, you don't wanna jinx it. You know what happened to your father. I mean, not that there's anything wrong with Montana. Absolutely, your father was meant for Missoula. But wouldn't Switzerland be great? My gosh, please let it be anywhere in Europe. Anywhere in Western Europe, we don’t want a Saratov situation. You know what? Bring it on. I'm ready for anything because I know that wherever the Lord takes you is where he wants you to be. Oh, I am so writing this down. Oh, you are just gonna be the best missionary, Bree, the best. I am so jealous that they lowered the age after my time. I so would have served when I was 19. Well, you became the best mom ever. So I'd say you served that mission - pretty well. - Still serving, thank you very much. Tyler, get off the internet. O-F-F you've already used your screen time. Speaking of screen time, I had better scoot. Nedra's having us over for a potluck dinner to meet her new boyfriend. What, sister Rockwell. I need all the details. Well his name is Bud and that's all I know, but I'll give you the full report tomorrow morning. I can't wait. Margaret, you know those cookies are for the Folkners. I am so proud of you, I love you. I love you so much. I miss you. You guys, Bree turned in her papers! Hey, you be a good girl, yeah? You be a good girl when I'm gone, yeah, yeah? I'm gonna miss you. You know, you wouldn't have to miss her if you took the internship I offered you. I know, oh, I wish I could. I'm just giving you a hard time. We're just gonna really miss you around here. Yeah me too a lot, but you know what? I'll be back before you know it. Great 'cause that's an offer. - Really? - Yeah, you have a talent for this. I mean I really hope that you stick with it. Yeah, I plan on it. Bye Patenka, I'll miss you. So most people know that crabs and lobsters are related, right? They're both part of the arthropod family. Do you know what else is part of that same family? Spiders. That's so crazy, that's so cool. It is cool Thys, it's very cool. I think I know what's bothering you. - You do? - Thys, I get it. You're upset about saying goodbye. Look, so am I, but let's not think about it that way. Just focus on all the fun times we've had this semester, all the memories we've made. I mean, look, we're not breaking up, we're just headed in different paths. - So let's not be sad. - Oh, I'm not sad. I promise I'm not sad, I'm actually like super happy. Okay, well you don't want to say it like that. Gotta go, we gotta go, - let's go, get up. - Wait, what? Okay, grab your crab leg, let's go. How's everybody doing out there tonight? Ladies and gentlemen, we have a special treat for you tonight but first, I'm gonna need a lady volunteer. Let me look around. You, yes. - What's your name? - Bree Carrington. - Is that a real name? - Yes. It sounds made up. All right come on everybody, give it up for Bree Carrington. How many of you have seen a dance battle? Because tonight, Bree is going to battle my man, Fanaue se Ein. It's a fire night dance battle. - What do I do? - I don't know. You're the one that volunteered. Just give it your best, all right? Yeah, that's a good start. Come on everybody, give it up. Let's check out the competition. It's okay, Bree, we'll keep you safe. It's safe to come out now. Bree Christine Carrington, will you marry me? Do it! Of course I will. - I love you so much. - I love you too. Give it up for the newly engaged couple, Bree and Thys. Almost had a heart attack, Thys. I mean, what happened to the plan? My mission, your girlfriend. She's not my girlfriend. Okay but she was for like 10 years and you're always talking about how you're gonna wait until she gets back and you know, give the relationship a real shot because you owe each other that. Oh, is that how I sound? - Is that my voice? - Just answer the question. Okay, okay, fair. What happened? You happened, all right? Yeah, I had a plan. I thought I had everything figured out but then you change all that. Bree, you change everything. No, what about my mission? I know. I'm sorry, I know, I just, I didn't wanna lose you. Did you talk to my dad? Is that still a thing? Yes, it is a thing. Even with like feminism and everything? - Thys. - No, sorry, yeah. Look I'm sorry it came as a shock to you, genuinely. It came as a shock to me too, right? 'Cause yeah, we talked about it, we talked about it like a million times, but every time I think about losing you, I go nuts. Like even right now, the idea of us breaking up, it hurts in a way that I can't really handle. Did you pray about it? Everyday since I met you. Like it feels right, right? - I don’t know, maybe. - Maybe? She says maybe 'cause like five seconds ago, you were on stage going, oh my gosh, yes Thys, of course I will. Oh is that what I sound like? Yes, yes, the cadence is a little off, but the tone is like dead on. Okay, so what's your answer? Because I can't really handle a maybe. I think I just need a second to process it and to pray about it and talk to my parents. But are we talking like, days, months, years? Like what are we thinking? I don’t know exactly. I mean, Thys, do you realize that tonight is the first time that you've ever even said, I love you, to me? True, but Bree, I mean it. And you said it back, so what does that tell you? Did you mean it? Yes, I love you. I love you too. I've wanted to say that for so long. I'm sorry, I'm sorry if I scared you. No, I messed up. I should've talked to you, of course I should've talked to you. Take as long as you need and maybe you don't say anything about this to people. I mean, just until you figure it out. Of course. Give it up for the newly engaged couple, - Bree and Thys. - Look at my cinematography. I captured you perfectly. I was so scared. Here it is in slow motion. You look possessed. I still can't believe he did it. I can, that hull is crazy. What'd your mom say? I haven't called her yet. What, it's like 03:00 a.m. for her. I'll call her in the morning. Wanna to watch "Black Mirror"? I'm exhausted, I think I'm just gonna go to bed and read and do a little praying, okay? Fine, I'll just check my Finsta. I told you to delete that account.

Oh and remember that the Hawkins reception is here tonight in the cultural hall. So let's leave it a little bit better than we found it, okay? Nedra, your practices is really improving. Well it's no CrossFit, but my boo says that it's calming my temper, - so I'll stick with it. - Okay. I really like what you said about letting go of what you can't control.

Get up, we got 20 minutes to get to the airport if we're gonna catch the non-stop. What's happening? Honey, you know what? I know what's not happening, but I know what’s not happening, this is not happening. Okay, this is one of those meme, gify things. It's not a gif and it's not a joke. Get your butt out of bed, let's go. Okay, but you know what? Before we go completely insane and fly to Hawaii, hey, let's give her a call. Oh I tried calling her 37 times. She's not answering her phone, so I need to go and talk to my daughter face-to-face. Okay honey, we're not really in the best financial situation to take the last minute trip. I've got it all covered. Nedra is gifting us her sky miles and Holly is taking care of the kids. Lodging and there's some food... I don't care if we need to build a lean to on the beach and eat coconuts for every meal, I need to talk to my daughter. We need to talk some sense into her. I'm gonna pack. I got you covered. 72 Hour kits, those are for emergencies. What do you call this? Leilani wake up. Someone posted my engagement video and now everyone is reposting. So messed up, who would do that? You did it. You're the only one who had this video. Who did you send it to? I only sent it to Lily. Lily Porter? You might as well send it to Buzzfeed. Leilani what were you thinking? She promised not to post it. Well she lied. That's so messed up. Over 500 likes and no photo credits? You don't understand, my mom saw this. Wait, my video is how your mom found out? I mean, she's literally going to kill me. What do I do? I know a cave on the big island. It's not much we can hide in there until this all blows over. I'm not hiding in a cave. I'm just brainstorming. - I just have to call her. - What are you gonna say? I just have to call her and tell her the truth. Maybe if you saw a picture of the cave, it's not so bad. Do you hear that? Crazy, it sounds like it's coming from outside the door. Aloha, Bree. Is there something you wanna tell us? I don’t understand, are you engaged or not? Well at first I said yes, but then I needed more time to... More time, perfect. How about a quick 18 months? Yeah, sounds perfect, let's get you packed up so that we can catch the red eye tonight. No, I'm not leaving here until I figure this out. What's to figure out? The semester's over, you’re going on a mission, you're not contributing to the national teenage bride statistic. You were a teenager when we got married. I was six days shy of 20 and that was your fault for asking too soon. And I still regret it by the way. You regret marrying dad? What, are you serious? No, of course not. I would have always married your father. But in a perfect world, I would have served a mission first and had more life experiences while I was still single. Okay, I think what your mother's trying to say is that her choice to get married wasn't necessarily her plan, but it was a choice that she made after careful consideration and a spiritual confirmation. And not a split second decision after gorging myself on crab legs. I'm sorry, that was insensitive. I'm just trying to understand. It doesn’t seem like that's what you're doing. Sweetie, do you remember what you told me? I tell you everything. You have to be more specific. About your mission. - No. - Well I do and I stitched it for you on the plane. Wherever the Lord takes you is where he wants you - to be, your words. - Okay, but he took me to Hawaii. So what if marrying Thys is what he wants for me? How could that be? He proposed to you in public for crying out loud. Well, that's the thing, at first I did just say yes because I felt pressured with all these people watching us, but then when we talked about it, just me and him... He and I. - Mom. - Sorry, go on. When it was just the two of us, it started to make more sense and then I prayed about it. - And? - Well it wasn't like an angel came down and told me what to do, but it felt good and it felt peaceful. It just feels right. Oh my sweet girl, he's beguiled you. - Oh geez. - No. Bree, honey, come. What did I do? Well, your daughter just left the room in tears. What do you think? Well, she's crying because she's about to give up her dreams over a boy. Her dreams or your dreams? I'm her mother, our dreams are the same. She's the one that wanted to serve a mission. I mean, sure, I might've pointed her in that direction, but she submitted her papers of her own free will and choice and now 24 hours later, she's getting married. Well, this is a difficult time of life. You remember being this age? We need to be here for her. Bree, honey, can we come in? The Chesterfields have invited us over for dinner tonight. Oh, we wouldn't wanna impose... No, that sounds lovely. I need you to be more than cordial. They may well end up being my future in-laws, so I need you to be respectful. When am I not respectful? Mom, I don't wanna fight with you. This is new for all of us. I don't expect you to know exactly how to deal with this, but I do expect for you to treat me like an adult. Is that fair? That's fair. - Hi, auntie. - Oh Leilani. What's this all about? She was scared of mom. ♪ There is beauty all around ♪ Curt, I can't believe you wore cargo shorts. Well I’m sorry I didn't think about fashion while I was packing my 72 hour emergency kit. Always think about fashion. Well next time, I'll pack a matching onesie. Aloha. - Oh, thank you. - This is so nice. - They're for me? - You of course. - That's how you do it. - Matches your shirt. - Thank you. - Oh, these are so beautiful. Thank you didn't need to bring anything. Oh no, it's the least we could do. This is so generous of you to have us. Are you kidding? We've been dying to meet you. Bree has told us so much about you, we feel like we know you already. Only the good things, don't worry. And anyone who raised a daughter this amazing has gotta be pretty incredible. Well, thank you very much and we've heard nothing but great things about you too. - So the bribes work. - Yes. Good job, Breebee. Where's Thys? He's out getting a key ingredient for din-din. He'll be back soon though. Hey, let's move this party onto the patio. - Please come on in. - Great, yeah, let's do that. Welcome to our little beach pad. It's amazing, wow. I figured with all the fresh coconut and pineapple on the property, I was just one Vitamix away from the most delicious drink known to mankind. Please help yourself. They're virgin of course. I can't understand why anyone would want to ruin this with rum, am I right? I agree. I'm still tinkering with the recipe a little bit. So feedback is welcome. - Cheers. - Cheers. I'll look at those waves. Swell's coming in. Oh, we've got a live one here. Is that true, Curt? Do you like to hang 10 as they say? Well, no, yeah, I used to surf. I mean, being from SoCal, but I just don't get a chance to do it very often anymore. He's being modest, he's very good. - Well. - Well then you'll have to borrow one of our boards while you're here. I don’t think we're going to have time for surfing. We might. I still can't get over this view. Trust me, you never do. And the ocean wildlife, incredible. And you can see it from here? Oh mom, all the time. You see everything, spotted dolphins, spinner dolphins, bottle-nose, whales too, humpbacks, sperm, - false killer whales. - False killer whales? Yeah, they're a little larger than a dolphin. They're the only surviving species of the Pseudorca genus. They're one of my favorites. Wow Bree, you really got a knack for this Marine biology stuff. She has definitely taught us so much. I think I see something. Oh really? Is that a dolphin? That is a rare and peculiar species of the Chesterfield variety. It's Thys with our dinner. Aloha, Carringtons. - Aloha. - Aloha. Mom, dad, this is Thys. I'm so excited to finally meet you, but I smell like tuna fish and I'm holding it gigantic spear gun. So I'm gonna do this properly and go inside and shower first. Actually before you get cleaned up, why don't you take Curt out and catch a few sets - before dinner? - Oh heck yeah. - Oh yes. - Nonsense. No, we are here to visit. Curt can surf later. - Yeah. - No really, it'd be fine. Besides it's gonna take me a while to clean those bad boys and get everything ready. - Okay, okay. - Well Curt can help you clean the fish. I can help, dad, you should go. My own sous chef, I like that. Mom, You should have Mrs. Chesterfield give you a tour of this place, it's amazing. Oh yes, that would give us some girl time. You don't mind, do you, honey? - It's wonderful. - Oh yay. Come on, let's go. You know it's funny, I didn’t think I'd actually enjoy living in paradise, but you know what? It turns out, it's not so bad. So where should we start, the east or west wing? Oh, I... When in doubt, go east I always say. So for openers, all of the wood here was locally sourced. Oh, of course. It was tricky. I didn't wanna go overboard with the decor here. I mean the beauty of these islands, it just, it speaks for itself. That's why I opted for simplicity. Can see that. You know it's funny, initially, we never even planned to have a second house, but we found we were spending so much time here with foundation and all, you know? It just, I don't know, didn't make sense not to. Ah, and there they are, my Stripling warriors, all served missions and all married in the temple. Well all except Thys of course. I mean, not yet anyway. - So handsome. - Yes, they are definitely blessed in that department. Derek here, he struggled with his weight a little bit for a while, but still he married a Romney cousin. Come on through. Next stop will be my home clinic. You'll have to excuse the mess. I can't tell you how excited I am about this. Yeah, feeling good? Yeah, it’s been a little while. So no judgment. Oh no, from what Bree tells me, you're probably gonna show me up out there. I don’t know about that. So how are you doing with all this craziness? The guts are kind of gross, but it is interesting. No, I mean between you and Thys. I understand he took you a quite by surprise. I think he was just trying to make it special for me. Well that's our Thys, he never wants to miss an opportunity, but sometimes he jumps, doesn't know where he's gonna land. Hope he didn’t scare you too badly. It's not that, it's just I... And you don't have to defend him. I mean, he messed it up and he knows it. But between me and my sous chef, I hope he has a chance to make it right. It has been way too long. You've been great, you haven't missed a beat. Well, we've got to head back in. I don't want to put it with Carrie. It looks like a lull anyway. Real quick before we head back inside, I owe you an apology. For what? For proposing the Bree without your permission. No, no, I don't know what I was thinking. I heard some podcasts say that it's an archaic sexist ritual to ask the father first. So I was really conflicted, you know? 'Cause Brie's like really into the whole feminist thing. So am I obviously. I mean I think everyone should be. Not everyone, if you're not, like that's totally like, everyone's got a different like trajectory to the same spot, you know? Like you might be one and you don't, it’s just about, you know, valuing women are the same, as we're equal. Mr. Carrington, what I'm trying to say is that I love your daughter very much and nothing would make me happier than if you gave me your blessing to marry her. I got you. You good, are you okay? - Let's get you back inside. - Yeah. Come on. Hang on a second, you got my permission. Are you sure? 'Cause you probably concussed. Hey, you saved my life. What am I gonna say? But don't get too excited, you still need Carrie's blessing. But if this is what Bree wants, you got my support. All right. Well the good news is you are not going to need any stitches. That's great. But I went ahead and sealed up the wound with some medical glue just in case. - Thanks. - Okay, just gonna shine this in your eyes, okay? - Yeah. - All right. Great, no concussion, but I’m going to keep an eye on you just in case. - Thank you. - Great. - My pleasure. - Honey, what were you thinking? You could have drowned. He was in good hands. Thys is a Red Cross certified lifeguard. There's the dinner gong. That means Scott must be ready for us. Hey listen, I hope you don't mind, I took the liberty of pulling out a pair of fresh shorts for you. You're roughly the same size as my Luke. Okay, why don't you guys go ahead and change and I'll meet you out there. - Thank you so much. - It's my greatest pleasure. What was that all about? Well, I'm sorry. It wasn't planning on getting pounded by an eight foot wave. I'm talking about this family. Something is up, I mean this is next level kindness. Well maybe they're just really great. Look at all these throw pillows, nobody's that perfect. Something has got to be wrong with them. Okay, you told Bree you'd give them a fair chance. I am giving them a fair chance and they're totally winning me over. And that's not easy, so what does that tell you? Be honest, do you think that they put something in our pina coladas? Okay, you're done. That’s the second gong. Okay, so I'm gonna change into Luke's shorts, which are very nice by the way and I can go out there and support our daughter Bree and I hope you join me. Fine, but you're getting me a dinner gong and I don't care how much it costs. It's bone appetit in Japanese. Well eata tacomas to you too. This looks amazing. When you spend three years in Osaka, you pick up a thing or two. Oh, were you there for business? Technically yes, but it was the Lord's business. Mom and dad were mission presidents in Osaka when I was in grade school. Of course they were. Shall we bless the food? - Yeah. - Son, would you say it? Yeah, of course. Our dear father in heaven, we are very thankful to be here with the Carrington family, thankful for their amazing daughter. She's been a blessing to everyone at this table and then some. We are thankful for the food, we ask you to please bless the hands that prepared it. We're thankful for the ocean that gave us this food and for the beautiful place where we live. We'd ask you to bless us with the spirit of love and friendship, that we will truly be able to get to know each other tonight. We will also ask you to bless that those of us making big life decisions may do so carefully and with the guidance of the Holy Spirit. We say these things in the name of Jesus Christ, amen. Well, it's been wonderful to get to know you, Bree. It's just been a treat for us and to bring your parents with too, it's really nice to meet you and know what a terrific job you've done in raising your daughter. You can't know what she means to us. Excuse me for a second, I'm gonna go outside to get some fresh air. - I'll join you. - Great. Aren't they're just the most adorable couple in the world? I remember when you used to look at me like that. Oh, I still do. You must be so jet lagged. Oh, it's fine. I am looking forward to a good night's rest though tonight. So are you staying, Turtle Bay? - No. - The Marriott? Well not... We actually don't get to spend much time with Bree these days, so we're gonna crash at her pad. Nonsense, you're staying in our guest house. - Yeah. - Oh no, yeah, no, we'll be fine, it's fine. We insist, end of discussion. - Okay, okay, thank you. - Okay, thank you. I'm onto you, mister. What are you talking about? Just taking my dad surfing and saving his life. - Is it working? - On my dad, but the jury is still out on my mom. I asked your dad for permission. - Really? - Yes. I'm trying to make it right. Well what did he say? He said he trusts you and that if this is what you really want, I have his blessing. Ask me again. Wait, what? Get on your knee and ask me again. Bree Christine Carrington, will you marry me? - Yes. - Yes? For real this time. Shizah, I put my best bottle of Martinelli's on ice just in case we had a reason to celebrate and I am sure glad that I did. Many, many years ago... May I have the honors? - Of course. - Thank you. First of all, I just feel like I need to apologize. I started the day off as a real negative Nancy. Bree, I have tried to teach you correct principles and help you make good choices and you've never let me down. I trust your decision and I'm proud to share you with Thys and this amazing family. I admit that I am a hard nut to crack but once I'm in, I'm all in. I'll drink to that. - Cheers. - Cheers. I hate to break up a good party, but we'd better get planning the wedding. February 13 is but less than two months away. Two months? February 13th, the 13th of February. Two, one, three. Mum, it's okay. Bree, why didn't you tell your mother you already had a day picked out? - Dad, I... - Because she didn't know. I talked to my parents about it but I didn't have the chance to talk to Bree yet, sorry. I thought we should wait til the semester is over. Well it's just a simple miscommunication. But we're all here, so why don't we just pick a day that works better for everybody? Great idea Curt 'cause I gave it a shot and it's just not gonna work. No matter how I read it or say it, it's just not numerically aesthetic and hello, the 13th? Who wants to start their marriage together on unlucky day? Well actually worked out okay for us. And your parents too. Oh, let me guess, and your grandma too. Actually. You all chose February 13th. I wouldn't say it was a choice per se. It was... You see, it was the day after the Pearl Harbor attack. My grandpa Glenn, he'd lied about his age and he enlisted in the Marines and as fate would have it, he was called to action the following Valentine's day, 1942. He was only 17, so his parents wouldn't let him marry his sweetheart, Clarice. So they eloped the day before. February 13th. Unfortunately a couple of months after he received the Congressional Medal of Honor for bravery, he went missing in action in the Philippines and was never seen again. But luckily for us, his wedding night had been well, fruitful. So you can see why Thys chose the 13th, to honor their wedding. Thys, I love that you thought about that and gosh, so special, but it's so soon and we really should be deciding these things together. Right, yeah. When were you thinking? Okay, what about April 25th? I mean the semester will be over and I've always really wanted a spring wedding. I love that idea. Except my parents have there Nourish the Children trip starting in March. How long does it last? Six months. Okay, how about the end of September then? Oh, I love fall. Babe, that's a nine month engagement. So? Some people consider nine months to be a really short engagement. Yeah, they're called Catholics. I don’t want to get married in the dead of winter, Thys. Okay so we could get married out here. - You know my granny - The sooner this happens, - the pricier it's gonna get. - Can't travel. If cost is a problem, we can help with that. Is my dad seriously - talking about money right now? - I'm not saying that. Thys, we've waited this long. Let's wait, what's the big deal about waiting another nine months? Everybody, settle down. As mother of the bride, I invoke executive decision. Eight weeks is a ridiculous amount of time to plan a wedding, especially if we're gonna do it right and make it special in the dead of winter mind you. I would have to call in every favor anyone ever owed me and pressure all of my friends to work non-stop in order to plan and execute it properly, it would be insane. But if anyone can do it, Carrie Carrington can. Chock it up. In honor of Glen and Clarice, February 13th it is. Oh wonderful. Did she just referred to herself in the third person? I just go with it. Now somebody get me a binder. Okay, did you see that shower? There's like 12 nozzles. This is the guest house, wow. Now how did Monica have this all ready to go? Well, we called it homemaking night in the 90s, it's what we did. Poor thing didn't have any daughters, so this is her last chance to use it. Well, well, did someone changed their tone? No, what can I say? They're amazing. I think she's my spirit animal. I thought your spirit animal was a cougar. Well she's that too. How amazing does she look for her age? Well she's no Carrie Carrington. Hey, what'd you say we go to bed and you can finish that later? Later? There is no later. We have 36 hours to take advantage of everything that we need to do here. Well, how about taking advantage of this amazing place before things get crazy? Too late, bub, things are already crazy. Besides I'm in business mode, not surfs up dude mode. Right, right, yep. Well our oldest daughter is getting married and there is no time to celebrate love or the union of souls. Oh please, I know what kind of union of souls you wanna celebrate. We need to have a clear plan if we're gonna pull this off. Oh yeah, what if I pull this off? Come on baby, let's go. Valiant effort, dude, but it's gonna have to wait. Besides I'm about to put my grind guard in. Pouting only hurts your chances. The key to victory is to divide and conquer. I know we haven't finalized the exact venue or event details, but we can at least finalize the guest list and collect addresses. Monica and I will take the lead. We also need to shoot and finalize the engagement photos. Make sure you choose a photog you can trust. Thys, fix your face, you look constipated. Can someone remind me why we're doing this in the studio? We live in Hawaii, we already have the best backdrops in the country. Okay, well someone wanted a winter wedding, so we need a winter setting. Okay, enough arguing. Mama C gave me a 24 hour turnaround, so I'll just fix it all in post. Face the fan and pretend you're in love. Crank it, Maurice. Smile Bree, awesome. Thys, your face. Curt and Scott, don't be discouraged, but I need you to take care of the boring stuff, mostly phone calls. Plot your information on the detailed spreadsheet I've prepared for you. - February 13th? - Correct. I know it's a long story. It's available? That’s amazing, can we put a hold on it? I'm sorry, February 13th this year. When you finish that, call the list of preselected temples that Thys and Bree have provided you with. Find the open ceiling times and available officiators. This will be tough, but we're counting on you guys to come through. This is my favorite, definitely the most cinematic. Supposed to be an engagement photo, not a film noir poster. What about this? Oh, I like that, I look good in that one. Are you serious? It's not about you, Thys. No one cares about the dude. Perfect, print it. It there's always the classic collage. When you love yourself so much, you can't just choose one. Tempting, but no. Or you could just go with this. It's perfect. ♪ I am somewhere in the sand ♪ ♪ And I wish I was an ocean ♪ Where have you been all day? Well I'm sorry, did you not check the Google doc? You'd have to nominate me for an Oscar 'cause I'm done so Donso Washington, thank you very much. All right, I stand correct. Hey, I've got another hour rental on the scooter. Wanna head up the coast? Don't push it, come on, chop, chop. I don't think that there's any way we can pair this down, - do you? - No, I agree. So we have 753 for the reception. And what, 100 for the luncheon? What are you thinking about the luncheon? Something the day off? Scott and I were thinking of dinner the day before. We just have so many people traveling in. It would just be family and the wedding party oh, and a few VIPs perhaps. Well let me know if you need any help planning it. Listen, you have your plate so full with everything else. We'll handle the dinner, okay? Probably keep it simple. Just I don't know, book a restaurant or the governor's mansion, we'll see. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm sorry. Sometimes I get so focused that I forget to tinkle. Oh my goodness, of course. Down the hall and to your left. Thank you. Okay. Sorry about that. I got a really cool it with the LaCroixs, you know what I mean? Fun family photo wall in there. Oh nice, right? Yeah, who's the family that you're with? Oh, those are the Lees, they're our oldest and dearest friends. Mark's been friends with Scott since, boy, - I guess high school. - Really? Yes, they're on the invite list. Of course. Unfortunately, I'm not sure they'll be able to make it. Bridget gets released about a week before the wedding. So they might just happen to be in Barcelona that week if you know what I mean. How did she take the news? I mean from about Thys. She doesn't know yet but that's only because I told Thys that a proper Dear Jane letter should be hand written out of respect. Well, I hope she takes it well. She'll be fine. She is such a catch. When she comes back, she'll have her pick up any young man she wants. Well, Bree's quite the catch herself. Mom, look. Oh gosh. - You okay? - Yeah, it's no big deal. Do you still feel good about this? Yeah, yeah, I mean it's been a little crazy, but we knew it would be that way. I don't want our engagement to be crazy. No, no, I just meant like with scheduling. - It'll be fun. - Okay. I wish you were coming with me tonight. I can't believe we're spending Christmas apart. I know, hey, but the good news is that it's not gonna happen again. - Last time. - True, true. All right, we should probably get you to the airport. No, no, just a few more minutes. You still felt good about all this? As good as I can, this is life. Our parents trusted us, I guess we gotta trust them. I mean they're adults, right? Technically. I wonder what the Chesterfields are thinking about all this. Oh, I bet they're just as stressed as we are. We have got to hit the ground running. Come here just a minute. I'm sorry that I was short with you earlier. I'm so glad that you got the temple appointment and the country club squared away. Oh, about that. Don't tell me they cancel. No, no, they didn't cancel, but I don't know if it's worth the money. I thought they gave you the Chesterfield discount. Yeah well I guess some people's definition of discount is different than others. Well if you're so worried about money, then why are you buying all these crappy souvenirs? These are for the kids. I spent tens of dollars on this, not tens of thousands of dollars. I just, I think that we should find a low budge solution. You want our daughter's wedding to be low budge? Do you think I wanted to be unemployed right now? I didn't exactly ask Randy to cancel my contract. He was supposed to take care of us. It was a startup, it failed, I mean that happens. How long are we gonna be poor? We're not poor, Carrie. Well we can't afford that venue for our daughters wedding. What do you call that? I didn't say that. I just say we need to come up with a contingency plan, that's all. Fine. Thys is gonna pull the car around, okay? Is everything okay? - Yes, of course. - Of course. Thank you both so much. I couldn't imagine doing this without you, but I'm getting really excited. Oh yeah? I love you both so much. You really think we can pull this off? - Yes. - Oh yeah. But we're gonna need our girls. Are you sure you're not feeling jet lagged, Carrie? We can always start this tomorrow, you know? - Yeah. - Please, please, forgive me for what I'm about to reveal to you. It is the biggest cause of shame I have in my life, but there are no other options. I promise we'll finish it one day. The timing is just never right, you know? Who knows that's what the boys do down here. I feel so vulnerable. At least no one will bother us. Except for maybe a few brave spiders. This was a mistake. I'm gonna kick Curt out of his home office. - No, it's perfect. - No, no, no. Look, we're all set up here. I really appreciate both of you. I couldn't do this without you. I mean, it just means a world to me that you would drop everything - just to help me. - Enough with the chit-chat. I've got a hard out at 1800 hours. It's Jazz versus the Nuggets tonight and Bud got us court side seats. So let's plan the heck out of this thing. All right, let's pound it. Will we ever learn? Kat, guess who's back. At first, she totally wanted to kill me, but now she's all in now. You know that even though she's on her mission, Paige is my official maid of honor. It's a pact we made for each other in the seventh grade and I have to honor that, but I wanted to ask you if you would be my first bridesmaid? D.C., yeah, wow. What an amazing opportunity for you. No, no, not at all, just remember me when you're running for president. Trinity, what's up girl? Yeah, Thys, T H, Y, S, it's Dutch. Jenny, my cousin went two years ago actually and she really loved it. So I think you're gonna love it. Ashley, I just can’t believe you're gonna be gone. But Erica, what up? I did always want a spring wedding. In total, six months, but honestly it feels like forever. Sarah, Lisa, Haley, Taylor, Hi, it's Bree. I thought camp was complicated, but this is next level. She's only just begun. I hope Bree appreciates all this. Where is that little diva anyway? Oh, I'm sure has her own to do lists. Do you think she would miss me if I went out and got some snacks? I'll take some Flaming Hot Ruffles and a Wild Cherry Pepsi. Here, take the hog. You'll be quicker. I'll cover for you. Don't even think twice about it. You're not missing a Disney cruise for my wedding. You guys, thank you so much for inviting me. I figured it was time we all got together again. After you. Oh thank you, Phoebe. Surprise! ♪ Mormon Mormon Mormon Mormon ♪ ♪ Bree met a Mormon boy ♪ ♪ He is her pride and joy ♪ ♪ She goes most everything from Alma on down ♪ ♪ Someday she'll be his wife ♪ ♪ She'll have eternal life ♪ ♪ Oh how she loves her Mormon boy ♪ Oh you guys. So are you going to have babies soon? 'Cause I'm like a really good babysitter. - Very, veery good. - If you have too many, we can totally babysit together if you're nervous. Have you seen how hot Thys is? I'm like Smuckers 'cause I'm like jelly. You seriously had no idea he was gonna ask? No idea. I would have seen it a mile away. Credit card receipts, ATM withdrawals, bank statements, rock that big has got a paper trail mile long. Easy to find if you know what you're looking for. Can I see your ring? - It is so pretty. - I know, right? - Is it real? - I hope so. I do hope your heart's not set on the riches of the world. Was it hard to say yes with all those hot Hawaiian dancers all around you? Not for that reason, just 'cause I was so nervous. How much can he bench press? How's school going, Bree? Well I get to swim with dolphins and I get school credit for it. So it's pretty awesome. But honestly I love the academic work too. Have you studied narwhals yet? Not yet, but I'm excited too. Buckle up, they're so awesome. Wait, so what happens with your mission then? Can Thys come with you? I wish, no. Well technically he could, but when they're like 70. Actually I won't be able to go on my mission anymore. My call doesn't come for a couple of months and when it does, I'll just have to tell them that I'm not able to go. But that's okay, you know? 'Cause I have a new mission, marriage. - Yeah. - Great. The most important mission of your life. - Yeah. - Really is so good. Oh, it's my mom. You guys, I have a question. I just wanted to ask each of you if you guys would be my Bree's maids? Okay, I can cross off pick bridesmaids. Wow, I blew it. What do you mean? We were at that restaurant for over two hours and I only cross off one thing on my list. That's okay, we were catching up and having fun. I'm not supposed to be having fun, I'm planning a wedding. Well just try not to be so stressed. I'm not stressed, I just.. Wanna hold Roxy for a bit? I'm fine. See, perfect. Oh look, we're here. Thank you guys so much for lunch. You really are both the sweetest. Bye. You think she's okay? She's a Carrington, she kinda has to be. Oh this looks amazing. Hi ladies. What are we working on? Just bugging away. Well it's the reception line logistics. We're trying to find the right flow. Here, this is a diagram of the cultural hall. But my reception's at the country club? Well mama said it was too much moolah. Well I just wanted to have a backup plan just in case there are any problems. What sort of problems with there be? I mean, dad booked it already, right? Well just in case we change our minds. I'm not changing my mind. You know we have a plan for the country club too. Just want to cover all our base. Looks great. I feel like reception lines are a little superficial, even archaic. I just think it'd be nice if Thys and I could mingle organically with our guests and not spend the whole night talking to, you know, someone's grandpa that we don't even care about. No reception line? What are we, cave people? You know, let's just put a pin in it and your mom asked me to help you with your dress. And so I called a couple of local boutiques. Or you could wear my old dress, ta-da. It's you know, it's got that retro, vintagey vibe. Mom, I'm sure that you looked beautiful when you wore this, but I just really don't wanna look like a polygamous hipster. What are you talking about? She's got a point. I mean I'd know because my niece is one of them. A hipster, not a polygamist. Well we could alter it. I mean the fabric has really held its quality. Mom no, this is my wedding dress that we're talking about. Okay, why are you being so cheap all of a sudden? Thank you so much for your help today, ladies. We really appreciate it, but if you'll excuse us, my daughter and I need to go to a safe place and work some things out. I'm sorry that I called you cheap, I know it's your trigger word. Frugal is just such a superior word on so many levels. I know, I didn't mean it. So are we like poor now? No, we're just in conservation mode. Why didn't you guys tell me? I don't know. I mean, we didn't keep it from you. You were just away at college and we really thought that your dad would have a job by now. Poor dad, ah and I was such a brat. But I was really excited for that country club. I know and we can still have it there. We have some savings that we can dip into. It'll be a stretch, but I can see that this is really important to you and I don’t want you to think that we're not willing to make sacrifices. Well, I can make sacrifices too. But the cultural home? Listen, I get it, it's a vaudeville stage with a basketball court, there's nothing cultural about it. Let's just stick to the original plan. Okay, hypothetically if we were to go with plan B, do you think you could make it feel really special? Oh please, with all the money we'd save, I'd make it Buckingham palace in there. Okay, I trust you. Let’s do it. Are you sure? - Yes, yeah. - Oh. But since we're gonna be saving all that money on a venue, do you think I could have my own wedding dress, a new one? Of course. I wish Paige was here to help me pick it out. I could really use a maid of honor. Has there ever been like a mother of the bride that's also been the matron of honor? I mean, that could be pretty cool, couldn't it? Nice try mom. It's worth a shot. All right, you ready to do this? Yeah, let's get you stirred up. Nope, we don't do that. We just say registered. That’s what we say when we go inside, okay? Okay, all right. So whatever we scan shows up on our registry? - Yup. - Rock and roll. ♪ I start to talk and you already know ♪ Oh mattress pads, - you gotta have those. - Oh and I need these. - Oh and mom, these. - Naper, yes, I love him. You can never have to may throw pillows. Mom, candles, Emerald Amazon. - White spruce. - Citrus water. Snuggly sweater. lsland moonlight. Good lighting is so important. Oh look at these frames. Mom, I have so many cute pictures from Hawaii. Planners! Vases and a really cute toaster over and a charcuterie board... And you really didn't get anything for me? Camping stuff, a Frisbee, some beef jerky? Well if you cared so much, you could have been there, mister. Ouch. Was that supposed to be your "E.T." impression? Oh no, that'd be awful. No that'd be more like, - oh. - Oh. Yours is so much better. I miss you. We FaceTime like every three hours. I know but this is not the same. I know, I miss you and your cute face. And you sure you’re okay that we changed the reception venue? You know my parents would have paid for the country club, right? I know they would have, but it's the bride's responsibility and you know how traditional my parents are. Yeah, but Bree, our guests have to come too. What do you mean? I mean, it's fine. Like if my parents have the rehearsal dinner, it's all good. It's whatever you want. I promise it's gonna be awesome. It's a weird that I don't care at all? 'Cause only care about marrying you. Are you sure? Because our invites go to the printer tomorrow. Print away, do your wifely duties. Okay, well I have to go to bed because I need some sleep, but... You sure, for real this time? For real, I'm hanging up. But I love you. I love you too. - I love you so much. - I miss you forever. Oh, it already hurts. Thys Abner, honey, haven't written to her yet, seriously? Take care of this honey. I will. Okay, Sister Brodhead was up all night addressing these. So please be careful. Oh, this definitely makes it real. Last chance to push the eject button. What's the big deal? It's only for eternity. All right, peasants, do your job. We have some serious business to attend to. See ya, suckers. You hear that, boys? Hop too. Oh honey, you use the moistener, that's what it's for. No way, love the taste. - It fits perfectly. - Right? In some parts. Holy Meghan Markle, I think this is it. When you smile, don't use so much gum. You know how you can get. All that lace, you know you're gonna snag. If you don't like my opinion, then I don't have to give it. I don't wanna wear any, I'm not gonna go to the wedding. I think I found it. ♪ I promise I'll keep it ♪ Wow, it's perfect. You look so pretty. I love it so much. Think we got a winner. - Oh boy. - What's the problem? Is it too expensive, is dad gonna freak? Yes, but I have ways of convincing your father. I have an old bottle of CK One fragrance in my top drawer. Okay, mom, I don't need to know the details. Just do what you need to do. Ring us up, Lucas. Oh my, wow. How did they know we were here? Let's give her some room. Home stretch, guys, almost there. Mitt Romney. No way. Oh, you think that's cool? Heard Steve Martin might show up. Who's Steve Martin. You're not my son. All girls, show me, Hannah. You were right, I love it. I love it, Mindy, Charlotte. The zipper goes in the back. - It's a choice. - Flip it, Mindy. Anderson sisters, how we doing? - It's so tight, Bree. - Well you're not supposed to wear clothes underneath it, Mykelle, Phoebe? Oh, you're adorable, Lane? I'm obsessed, you crushed it, Lucus! All right, I'm out. ♪ Just my luck, yeah ♪ ♪ Make new friend or maybe ♪ Are you done yet? What took you so long? Oh, that's lane. She's given me a ride to the post office. Oh, tell her to step on it because the last pick up is in 23 minute. Where's Cars? You really invited 700 people to your wedding? To the reception. We only invited extended family to the actual temple ceremony. Your temples are gorgeous. It must cost so much money to get married there. Actually it doesn’t cost a thing. Serious? Not a dime. Okay, well to be fair, you do pay 10% of your annual income for your entire life to the church. So it's not free per se, but you can think of it more like a membership perk than an upfront cost. Okay, right there to the left, perfect. Can I ask you guys something in confidence? - Sure. - Yeah. Is it weird that Thys is inviting his ex-girlfriend's family to the wedding or am I just being super paranoid? Well, that doesn't sound super normal. But didn't you say they're his close family friends? Yeah of like 30 years. Okay, then maybe it's not super weird either. Did he at least ask you before you invited them? No, they were just on the Chesterfield list. Well I mean he definitely should have asked you just to make sure you were okay with it. But maybe his parents did it without even thinking. I don't know, if you're uncomfortable with it, you should probably have a conversation. You're right. I'm just gonna talk to him about it before I said there's out, yeah? - Yeah. - I'll put it in my purse. Okay, let's go. ♪ I found what I need ♪ ♪ Like honey to a bee ♪ ♪ And I'm buzzing 'cause it feels so sweet ♪ ♪ And I've got you by the hand ♪ ♪ And I'll never give it back ♪ ♪ 'Cause together, you and me are made to last ♪ You guys, I think I'm getting cold feet.

So now we're going be asking Bree trivia questions about her beloved fiance. If she gets one right, then we have to stuff a marshmallow in our cheeks. But if she gets it wrong, then she has to stuff it in hers. All right, stretch those cheeks ladies, 'cause this is going to be easy Breezy. Enunciate, we can't hear you. Did you say "Napoleon Dynamite"? I'm so sorry, it was "Princess Bride". No fair, I've never even seen it. What? Who are you? Thank you, Sister Robinson. And now I have the whole trilogy. Well, as long as we're on the subject. Thank you, Nedra. You are always so thoughtful with your gifts. Don't thank me now, thank me later. Oh, Bree, would you mind getting the door? - Thys! - Aloha, stranger. Just warms my heart. You get anything good? Yeah, got lots of good stuff. Nice, show me what you got. I will on our wedding night. Right, good. - So good to see you. - You too. - Wanna get outta here? - Yeah. Okay. Wanna see what we've been up too? Now I know the basketball hoops are hideous, but don’t worry, Curt and the boys are gonna go early and take them down. Now I didn't have time to make everything exactly to scale, but I think this paints the picture thematically and otherwise and you might've noticed that there is no caterer on the vendor list, but don't worry, we have something better. It's called Costco and the Relief Society. It's beautiful, mom. Oh, did you guys happen to have any extra invitations? Yes but if you're going to add to the guest list, I'm gonna need to know ASAP 'cause I have to make some arrangements. It's not extra, my parents' friends didn't get theirs somehow. It's the Lees. Maybe it got lost in the mail. Yeah, that's fine. - I'll just snag an extra one. - The Lees. Now why does that name sounds so familiar? It's my ex-girlfriend's family. My mom said she talked to you about them though. I kind of was under the impression that they'd be out of town. They are, yeah, I think they were gonna pick up Bridget from Barcelona, but I think they must've just canceled their trip. Why do you say like that, With that weird little lisp thing? Barcelona? It's just how you say it in Spain. Oh, we’re not in Spain. Yeah, that's just how Bridget taught me to say it. Anyway, Miss Carrington, you don't have to worry. I totally get it, but I sent her a Dear Jane, pretty clear Dear Jane letter. They're just close family friends, so we thought it would be weird if they weren't invited. That's okay, right? I don't want... Sure, yeah, sure. Okay, this is great by the way. I love the whole spread. It's just like, yeah. I have a surprise for you. - Great. - Sound good? ♪ I don't believe I met yet ♪ ♪ A light to break my light ♪ Are you ready for your surprise? I thought this fancy dinner was a surprise. Oh no, it's way better. Are you ready? No. I need to get something off my chest first. Okay yeah, what's up, what's wrong? Promise you'll forgive me? It kind of depends on what you say. I lied to you. The Lees invitation didn't get lost in the mail, I just never sent it. Why? I meant to talk to you about it and I just got so busy and then I was just so excited to see you and I forgot. That's fine, that's fine, but like why did you feel like we had to talk about it? I don’t know, I guess... I guess I felt threatened. I know the history that you have with them and with Bridget and Thys, your parents basically have a shrine dedicated to her in their bathroom. Yeah but like, we're not a thing. We're not, you don't have to be worried. I know, but she gets back so soon and I just, I just... I didn't want either of us thinking about her on our wedding day. Honestly, they're probably not even gonna show up. I kind of hope not. Yeah but if they do, like I can't control that, right? Okay Bree, at some point you're gonna have to start trusting me, okay? I do trust you. It's just, I don't know. You haven't been around and it's been really stressful. Yeah, totally, I just... I'm here now though, all right? Everything's fine. - Promise? - Promise. And you forgive me? Oh, forgiven and forgotten, you're good. Okay, now I’m ready for my surprise. Okay, here is a hint. Oh, it's my surprise dessert? Is this like a scene from "The Princess Bride" or? ♪ Ba, baba, ba ♪ Oh, Blues Clues, is it Blues Clues? I don’t know you, no. First down, wee-oh, wee-oh. I am so lost. You really don't know? I got nothing. I got accepted into the business school at BYU Provo. I start second block. But I thought we were going to finish Hawaii together first? Yeah we were, but that was before I got accepted into Real BYU. Thank you very much. But what about me? I didn't get accepted. Yeah but you will, eventually. And what do I do before then? I just forget about my internship and drop out of school, go to UVU? Maybe. Thys, they don't even offer my major. You switch majors, big deal. Bree, Marine biology? That’s something you say when you're like five. You don't really stick with that. Sorry, that was... That was mean. I didn't mean that. I overreacted. I just was really pumped about this and I thought you'd be excited for me. I didn't even know that you applied. That's because I didn't tell anyone. I mean my parent knew. I don't care Thys, I'm your fiance. I need communication. This is our life, not your Instagram story. You're right, I'm sorry. I just, I felt so much pressure to provide for the two of us and their business school is one of the top programs. I just thought he'd be proud of me. I am proud of your Thys, but I need you to include me in these decisions from now on. I need to be able to have a say in things that affect us both. You're right, you're completely right. I'm sorry, will you forgive me? Of course, forgiven and forgotten. Don't say anything. Just follow my lead, be cool. What is happening? Stacey, oh that's so beautiful, is it French? No, it's just Stacey, it's American. It's very Regal. Listen, I have a coupon from a competitor. Will you honor it? This is expired two years ago. That's not gonna be a problem though, right? No. Amy? Okay, what are your wedding colors? Okay, I'm so glad you asked. How much time do you have right now? Is that Madagascar vanilla? - It is. - I knew it. What flavor is that? Oh that’s our cookie dough. - The cookie dough. - Super popular. Oh mom, how about the funfetti? Not for a wedding, that's not appropriate. It's fun for like fun, but it's not elegant. It's so good though. So what would you suggest? I really like fantasy creatures. Like maybe a nice friendly dragon or maybe a unicorn, a Pegasus or something like that. I mean, we were mostly get temples, but you imagine like a mermaid scene, a mermaid and a merman and they're, you know, they're close to each other. It could be really nice. But how much do you charge for a custom design? No, the prices are in the brochure. It's really impressive. And a little bit more than I anticipated. Well, there's a lot that goes into it. It's not just an easy thing to do. So time and creativity. Do you offer correspondence courses? Well, Jesse has a YouTube channel. How many subscribers does he have? It looks like you two are all squared away. Got your temple prep class you're finishing up on Sunday, you've got your recommends and you've got the appointment at the temple for the ceiling. And knowing Carrie, I imagine the planning is all squared away. - Yes. - Yeah. Is there anything else you guys need? I think just any advice that you have for us, you know, - before the big day. - Yeah, yeah. Think I've unloaded all my wedding wisdom. It's really up to you two at this point. It's all about your commitment to God and to each other. Okay. Thank you, thank you so much. Thank you, Bishop. Oh one more thing. I did hear rumblings about the girls planning a bit of a bachelorette party for you this weekend and I don't know your pals probably have something planned for you too. I just, you know, make sure you take it easy. - Of course. - For sure, yeah. ♪ Walk into the room ♪ ♪ I can't help stop and stare ♪ ♪ Show me what you got ♪ ♪ I hope you came prepared, right there ♪ ♪ 'Cause when you're messing with someone like me ♪ ♪ Get in check, get in check ♪ ♪ 'Cause there's no way that I'm gonna leave ♪ ♪ 'Til I get, 'til I get ♪ ♪ That thing, that bling, that ice ♪ ♪ That makes me cool like crazy ♪ ♪ That fire, desire, that's lit ♪ ♪ No if's, no but's, no maybe's ♪ ♪ It's what I want ♪ ♪ This is what I want ♪ ♪ What I want, this is what I want ♪ ♪ That thing, that bling, that ting ♪ ♪ That makes me cool like crazy ♪ ♪ Makes me cool like crazy ♪ I'm gonna go up to you and come on all these floors. ♪ If you give me the thing that I want ♪ ♪ Wait a sec, wait a sec ♪ ♪ And I'll give everything that I got ♪ ♪ Wanna get, wanna get ♪ ♪ That thing, that bling, that ice ♪ ♪ That makes me cool like crazy ♪ Aren't you guys gonna go? ♪ No if's, no but's, no maybe's ♪ You guys are pathetic.

Marriage is what brings us together today. I wish I had six fingers. Such quick texting. Rob Reiner's a cinematic genius. Shhh. Did you know that Cary Elwes actually broke his toe six months before the movie? Just like in "Lord of the Rings." Never eating that much yogurt ever again. Thank you for my blanket. Of course, I had to get my girl something. And thank you for taking us to the club. I thought you hated it. Yeah, I did, but I had to experience it, you know? We lasted less than 10 minutes. Okay, but we crushed every second of it. Am I right? Especially Hannah. I just hope Thys doesn't care. Why would he care? He might just think it was just too crazy. I mean, who goes to a club for their bachelorette party? Literally everyone. Besides I'm sure that his bachelor party is way crazier. He's going to Top Golf with his brothers. Or maybe slightly less crazy. I love you, Laney. - I love you too. - Seriously, you have always had my back, like no judgment, no matter what. Even though Paige is officially my maid of honor, unofficially, you're my maid of honor. Thank you for saying that, Bree. It really means a lot to me. I know I haven't been around much, but if you ever. I love you. Thys is here. What? Babe, we were only at the club for like five minutes and nothing happened, I swear. I mean, one guy smelled my hair, but that's it. Babe, what's wrong? You told me this was over. It is, but I feel like she has a point. I mean, we were together so long, it makes sense she at least wants to meet. And go on a date with an engaged person? It's not a date, it's not a date. You're going to dinner alone with her. Thys, it's a date. You read the letters, she just wants closure. Yeah I know what she wants, but what do you want? I would love for things to not be awkward between me and her. I mean, like, I feel like I over that, right? I used to take baths with this girl. - That's not helping. - When we were two. I know Thys, you have so much history with her and that's what makes it so hard. And you know, you keep saying that you don't wanna make it awkward for her and for her family, but why don't you care about making it awkward for me? I do care. Then why do you feel like you have to do this? If you don't want me to go, I won't go, okay? I will do whatever you say. But if you let me do this, I feel like it'll be the best for us. How? How can this be good for us? I know it's confusing and it isn't fair, but it happens, okay? It happened and I'm just trying to be honest and communicate with you and keep you involved with the decision. I thought that's what you wanted me to do. No come on, don't. I know I wanna be with you, Thys, and you can give that back to me when you are sure that you wanna be with me. Honey, 07:45, you wanna take a break? Carrie, babe, - hey, wow. - Hey. Look what you made me do. Oh, you ruined my feathering. Are you sure that's not an improvement? This is a lot harder than it looks. I dunno, it looks pretty hard. Still you know, I think you should get a professional to do this. We might be able to afford it now I got that new job offer. Shut up, serious? Oh that's so great. They're called Little Wagon, it's a smaller firm, but they're great. - Okay. - So let's celebrate. Get rid of those goggles. I've got a surprise for you. Oh, is it chicken parm? No guessing, come here. - All right, okay. - Okay, all right, big surprise, I'm going in. Deserved a little something special, so here we go. You turkeys, what are you doing? I thought you set this up for us. With the candles. It was so good. Oh, well that's great, I... It's fine, it's not their fault. I've been so busy planning. You know that family's schedule is totally out of wack. All right, don't worry, boys, all this wedding stuff is going to be over soon. - You made the right decision. - Absolutely. Just doesn't feel right. Well, it's gonna be really hard but if he comes back, you're both gonna be the stronger for it. Yeah but mom, what if he doesn't come back? Then he's an idiot. I'm sorry, but it's true. But what do we do about the wedding? We're not gonna overstress. We're gonna move forward as if it's happening and if we get to that bridge, we'll deal with it then. Yeah but we'd done so much already and we've spent so much money. Listen I don't want you to worry one minute about the money, okay? We can make more money and Costco has a generous return policy. I just want you to worry about getting this right and while he's thinking things over, you take this time to reconsider if this is still something that you want. But I've made up my mind. I know, but things have changed. This is new information. Why is everything falling apart? This is my engagement. This is supposed to be the best time of my life. Wait, who told you that? Everyone, I mean movies, Instagram, you guys. Oh, we did not have the perfect engagement. Things got a little hairy for a minute there, thought I was gonna get my heartbroken. For real? Yeah, well I had my doubts. I mean, I knew I loved your father, but I had feelings come up for someone else, someone from my past. Daniel Gregory. His name's not important. Anyway, they were real emotions that I had to deal with and lucky for me, your father was really patient. How do I not know about this? I don’t know, I guess I just don't like to think about it. Engagements are the worst. I mean, they're the worst because they're the best. It's a trial time that God gives us to really test out our relationship before we make the biggest commitment of our lives. You have the right to change your mind from the second you put on that ring to the moment you kneel at the altar. Why didn't you tell me it would be this exhausting? I guess we kind of forgot. We've been together so long, it’s hard to remember our lives before. Honestly, I just, I just want what you guys have. Oh sweetie, you'll get there, I promise. Hey, can I use my screen time?

Isn't marriage magical? Focus Bud, these lights won't untangle themselves. Who's the lucky guy? Are you sure I should be wearing this? It feels really weird. Yeah, I don't know why my mom insisted, but you've made her very happy. Think she just wants to show you off to all of her friends. You know, it's bad luck to see a bride in her wedding dress before the big day. And how can something this beautiful be bad luck? Come on, I wanna show you how too. How many layers is this? - It’s a lot. - It's a lot, yeah. - Mark, hey. - Hi. - Mark Lee. - Hi. It's wonderful to meet you. And I'm Alison. We’ve heard such amazing things. So have I. We'd love you to meet our Bridget. - Hi. - Hi. Congratulations honestly. Congratulations to you too, for just being a great person and yeah, the whole mission thing. That’s a really big deal. Thank you, yeah, no, it was a really great experience. If I could have everyone please be seated, we'd like to start - the festivities. - Good to see you. - Talk to you later. - Yeah, please. Why didn’t you tell me she was coming? What's the big deal? I thought we were over this. Are you over it? You should get to know her actually. She's a really great person. Maybe I should just make her one of my bridesmaids. Please don't make this weird. Everything's fine, for once, let's just have some fun tonight with no drama. Okay. You know, it's kind of ironic that Thys asked me to be his best man considering I was his worst brother. So that makes him either the biggest moron Or the most forgiving guy that I've ever met. I'm proud to be your brother. - Love you, man. - Love you, buddy. You're the best. And Bree, I did not forget about you. I know that we don't know each other that well yet, so you might not care what I have to say, but I think I have a message from somebody you do care about. Oh, who could it be? Who does Derek have a direct line to? He really wanted to be here tonight, but he, you know, I guess he's a busy guy. So if you could direct your attention to the back, I have a special message for you. Reading from our nation's Capitol. I'd like to take a moment and offer a special congratulations to Thys Chesterfield and his lovely fiance, Bree Carrington. Tomorrow's the day you've always dreamed of, now make that dream come true. I'm Mitt Romney and I approve this marriage. ♪ Oh, oh ♪ ♪ When I look in your eyes ♪ ♪ I see two eyes that look just like me ♪ ♪ And I know that you marrying Bree ♪ ♪ But I want you to know that I'll always be ♪ ♪ Your OB, older brother ♪ ♪ Older brother, your OB ♪ ♪ Older brother, older brother, your OB ♪ ♪ Your OB ♪ Dear Bree, I know this is crazy, but for the first time in my life, I don't know what to say. We're supposed to write something that will help you prepare for your big day. But I mean, I'm 13, what do I know? I'm not gonna make a list of marriage qualities because if your fiance has already won mom's approval, you know he's a catch. So I'm gonna take it to the next level. The thought that keeps coming to my mind is just to be brave. You know that as much as we've been excited for it, we've always been a bit scared to get married. I mean, how do you ever know that it's truly right? The answer is maybe you don't. Maybe the best we can do is make a choice. If what you choose makes you feel peaceful, be brave about it. If it doesn't, be brave about that too. That’s it, just be brave. Sincerely, yourself. The night we broke up was the hardest thing I've ever experienced in my entire life, but I knew I had to do it. I had to listen to my 13 year old self. I had to be brave. As much as Thys loved me, he somehow wasn't to put us first. I loved spending time with him, but I never felt completely safe or at peace when I was with him. I know Thys will grow to be a great man and he will make a great husband, just not the one for me. It's a horrible realization to have the day before your wedding, but that's how long it took me to figure it out. Oh my brave little Bree. The next morning when I saw my family, I remembered what it was like to feel completely safe again. Why are you guys all dressed up? Well. Apparently bud was so inspired by the wedding spirit, he proposed a sister Rockwell that very morning. Not one to waste time or money, she decided to carpe diem. And the smile on her face helped me forget my pain for a moment. ♪ I know that the view from my side ♪ ♪ You showed me every way you go ♪ ♪ You don't like to feud, am I right ♪ ♪ And maybe it's supposed to show ♪ ♪ No body grove, they grove with no body ♪ ♪ We all grove, don't go ♪ ♪ Go ahead on ♪ ♪ Go ahead on baby, just go ahead on ♪ ♪ You look like you a dream made of ♪ ♪ You took me on tonight ♪ I was worried about talking to people that night. I thought they wouldn't understand, that they would judge me for calling it off so late, but in truth, everyone was really understanding. Turns out a lot of people have stories just like mine, broken hearts, broken engagements, and of course, broken marriages. People ask me if I had the chance to do it all over again, would I change anything? It's hard to say. Sure, I would have saved myself a lot of heartache and saved my parents a lot of money. But that experience became a part of who I am today. I made those choices and I accept the consequences. Honestly, I don't know if I would change it if I could. All I know is that I'm not ashamed to say that once I was engaged. So that’s my fun fact. What about you, Sister Roblez?
