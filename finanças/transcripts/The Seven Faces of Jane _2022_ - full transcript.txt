What if I hate it? What if you love it? What if no one talks to me? I really don't think that's gonna happen. Did you go to camp? - Yeah. - Did you love it? I knew it! Well, you're braver than I am. How 'bout this. You wanna make a deal? - Fine. - Okay. Here's the deal. You try it out for a couple of days, you go swimming, you do the ropes course, see if you can make some friends, and if you really hate it, like, really, really, really hate it, I'll come get you. - Promise? - Yes. - I promise. - Fine. - All right? - Eh... I think you're gonna like it. Look at your cabin! Hi, how are you? - This is Molly. - Hi. Hi. Oh, my God, this is so sweet. Oh, you're gonna have the best time. Okay, honey, gimme a big hug, big squeeze, big squeeze. I love you. I love you so much too. There you go. Thank you. Bye, honey! - Bye! - Bye. Where's the closest place to get a cup of coffee around here? Oh. Hey, Mom. Jane, honey, I got something important to tell you. - Okay. - Okay, well, before you were born your father and I were running pretty low on funds... So we decided to... Oh, Mom, sorry, I got another person calling me, hold on. Hello? Hi, this is Kai from Iwataki Spa confirming your massage appointment today at noon. Yes. Yep. I am on my way. Great, we'll see you then, Jane. Okay, thank you. What was I doing? Oh, yes, coffee. Hello? Hello, is anybody in here? Hello? Is anybody in here? Screw it. I'll take a cup of that coffee and a slice of pie when you have a chance, Jane. I'm sorry, I don't work here, I'm... There she is. How'd the delivery go? Delivery? What? Where is your apron, Jane? I'm sorry, what? Here, put this on. Wh... what am I doing? Jane. Jane. Sorry. Sorry. As I live and breathe. If it isn't Jane. Tell me where it is. Where's what? All right. That's it. I've had enough. Tie her up and put her in the boot. Time to go see you-know-who. Wait a second. Who are you? I'm Jane, who are you? Okay, yes, this all makes sense now. This is the Jane who works here and this is the Jane that you're looking for. No, I am not. Yes, you are. No, I'm not. Yes, you are. That's enough. Get up. Both of you. Now, which one of you is the Jane that I'm looking for? All right then. Only one way to settle this. Call it. - Heads. - Tails. Okay, then. Heads and you get to go free, but she's coming with me. Tails and you get to go free... but she's coming with me. Did we know each other then? All you said was true... and still... you left without looking back. If we could speak to them now... what would they say? Oliver! Hey, Oliver. Hi. Let me guess. You're lost. No, not this time. I just stopped to grab a few things, so... You're good. Just pull up by the shore. I'm right here. All right, I'll see you soon. I can't wait. Okay. I love you so much. I love you too. Your eyes are so beautiful. I can't wait for you to meet my family. Jane! Jane! Jane! - Oh, wow. - Yo. - Hi. - Wow. Hi. - Oh, my God. - Look at you. - Wow. - Oh, my gosh. Hey. Oh, man. I'll hug you. Okay. It's really nice to see you. Sorry. I mean, you look... in... When was the last time... Oh, it was here. Well, I mean, it was near here. - That was here? - Yeah. Remember, we had that little spot by the rocks? I thought that's why you wanted to meet here. Oh! No, no, no. We're not going up there. I got a show down on the shore tonight. Oh, wow. Is that all right? Uh, you, um... Yeah, of course. - It's fine. Yeah. - Okay. Wow. Jane. I can't even believe you're here. So wait. You're playing music? Are... You're... D... drums or wh-? No, I lead the band. - It's my music. - What? Yeah, I drum a little, I did when I was younger, but fell off when we were together. Picked it back up with these folks a few years back and still going with it. Hi, nice to meet you. I'm Jane. An old friend from way back. I'm... Hi. Hi! Oh, sorry. Hi, it's a pleasure to meet you. - How are you? Hi. - Some guys back here... Hi. Pleasure to meet you. Hi. Good day. Hi. Lovely to meet you as well. - Hello. - And... Pleasure. Pleasure. Hi. Hi! So nice to meet you. We've known each other for, like, ten years, but I... Yeah, he's never said your name before. Well, I mean, we haven't seen each other... Okay, you guys, we need to rehearse. Nice to meet you all. They call you Tayo now? Yeah. I mean, that's my name. Oliver was something my parents came up with when they came here. Yeah. It's the band. Um, well, I brought a blanket, so. Oh. Okay. I... I mean I don't... I can go somewhere else. No, no, no, it's fine. Yeah, it's... Let me help you with that. Okay. Oh, I can do it. - It's... - Oh, okay. - I got it. Yeah. - Thank you. That's nice of you. All right. Are you sure I'm okay to stay? Of course, why not? I... I mean, this is your space and I really don't wanna... Look, it... it's all good. Tayo. You're cool. We're just gonna run through our routines for later. It's all good. - Okay? - Okay. - Okay. - Okay. All right. I love you so much. I love you too. Do you wanna go on a road trip? You and me and two or three kids? I can't wait for you to meet my family. Come on! Oliver! Ol... Oliver, my whole family is coming. We have dinner. What... you... You don't wanna go back? I... I don't wanna talk about this right now. Let's just... like... Honey, where are you gonna go? - Yeah, I got it. - Oh, my God! Whoa! I wanna make a toast. To love, life, and a great show. Thank you. By the way, chin-chin. - Here you go. - Oh, my gosh, thank you. That was so beautiful. That was nothing. Just warming up. I mean, look at you, though. This is my favorite part of the meal. That's the best one. What are we doing tonight? Thank you. Pass 'em, pass 'em. Hey. Get over here. What'd you think? I mean, my heart's still racing. All the years I knew you, I... I never saw you move like that. Wh... what do you mean? I... I danced. So now you remember? 'Cause earlier it was like, "Oh, I have a show on the beach, I don't remember anything about, you know, those rocks or..." So now you remember? Of course I remember. I... You're right, I... I didn't move like that. Almost a decade ago, hm? So... what do you remember about that day? Sorry. I'm sorry, I did not come here to put you on the spot. So why did you? You get stuck. Or you feel like it. And I think... the first place you wanna go is where you didn't feel so stuck. And, honestly, I just wanted to see you. And where you went to. Um... How're your parents? Man, I don't know. Honestly, they're the same, but I'm kinda doin' my own thing now. And, uh... Molly is eight and she's honestly kind of a handful. Truthfully, it has not been easy. Uh, wow. Well, she's in really good hands. It was cold. You wore my jacket. - Hey! - It kept you warm. Just talk to me. But it never really fit me right. Everything then... I don't know what I could've called mine. Tell me. Tell me what it is. The heart I gave you... I can't. I... I can't. ...it wasn't really mine. I can't. I... it's just the way they... Sorry if that's hard to hear. Don't say sorry. I think I knew. Even back then. But it still felt real to me, so... Back then, you were always a little distant. But now, here, seeing you play with the band. I'm just glad it worked out this way. When I think of that day... as I was then... it was all noise. Now... it's quiet. Hello? - Uh, is this Jane? - Mm-hmm. H... hi, Jane. This is Stan, uh, a good friend of Sybil's. - Oh, hi. - Hi, um... Yeah, I have some... Some bad news. Sybil was admitted to the hospital last night and, uh, she's not doing well. What? They, um, put her on a respirator this morning and, uh, she's in critical condition. Uh, she might not live through the night. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Um... If, um, you'd like to say goodbye, uh, you can come to the hospital. Unfortunately you won't be able to be in her room, but you can see her through the window. Yes. Yeah. I'm coming. So sorry to tell you this. ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ Hello? Hi, Jane. It's Stan. - Hi, Stan. - Um... Sybil passed away. I'm so sorry. She loved you so much. Thank you. - So sorry. - Thank you. I'll keep you posted, okay? Bye. Bye. Oh, God. - Do you need a ride? - Yes! Thanks. I hope you weren't out there long. Long enough. Yeah. So, uh... where are you heading to? - Topanga Canyon. - Oh. Unless we meet some cute guys along the way. Actually, I'm fed up with men. So predictable. They're always like... It's always the same. Well, sometimes that's not a bad thing. I guess. It is hard though. It... Those, you know, certain parts of a man that can't stop being a man. That's the part I like. - Really? - Yeah. How far are you going? Oh, I can take you to Topanga Canyon, it's on my way. - No way. - Yeah. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Fantastic. All right. Cool. So, what's a lady like you doing driving along a lonely road? I'm not sure. You're not sure? Hey, don't worry, I'm not trying to hit on you. It's just a question. No... I didn't... I... I'm... No, I'm sorry. I... I just... All I meant was that I'm a little lost. What do you mean? It says right there where you're going. Oh, I know that. So, what? You think it's lying? That's not what I meant, I... Never mind, it's... Is it okay if I put my music on? Yeah. Yeah. Hey, I'm Jane, by the way. - What's your name? - Valentina. Valentina. God, that's a beautiful name. God, my name's just Jane. I'm so glad that you needed a ride. I was having some anxiety, it's so nice to have some company. Hey, man, I'm nobody's caretaker. That is not what I mean. No, I'm sorry, it's just I've been driving alone and it's nice to have someone to talk to. That's fine. I just don't take care of people. Sometimes people pick you up and think you're going to be their savior. So, you've never taken care of anybody? Yeah. Myself. And that's the way I like it. Now and always. Huh. So you... you don't wanna have children? No, I wanna be free. Free to travel and meet people. I don't wanna get old to anyone and I don't want anyone to get old to me. Well, that has to happen in a relationship sometimes, you know. Sometimes... sometimes it's a lot of work. Well, that's why I don't do it. I told you, my relationship is with freedom. That's it. And you don't get lonely? Without anyone to depend on, or... come home to... To... to share with? To... I can't remember the last time I felt free. I mean, honestly, the idea of freedom scares me. Let's not get heavy. It's bad for the skin. Oh, shit, is it? Hey, how come you took this way instead of the freeway? It takes so much longer. I like driving on the open road. You can see everything. Sometimes when I'm going fast on the freeway and there's a bend up ahead, I worry that right after the bend, it drops off. What? The road. That it drops off and I won't be able to stop, you know? And it just ends. Well, it's a good thing we're on the highway then, right? - So thirsty. - Mm. I could drink a whole ocean. Mm. I'm thirsty too. I feel like I have a water, where is it? Careful! Here, have some. I'm not gonna drink your last sip of water. Go on. Have it. I want you to. Wouldn't it be so great if there were some cute guys working down on the side of the road that we could give a lift to? I thought you were fed up with guys. I was just hot and crabby. Cute guys are the best. They make everything bad disappear. Well... I think you'll find some of those in Topanga. Wait, what is that? Whoa, what is that? Do you see that? - Yeah? - What is that? Is that a vendor cart up there? Oh, my gosh, water! You saw it, didn't you? Yes, he was pushing a cart. He was right there. Maybe it was a mirage. That's crazy. I don't like this kind of things. It's okay. It's okay, it happens. Put your seat belt on. Well. It's almost dinner time. Wonder if anybody even noticed I'm missing. Oh, no. Of course they did. I bet they're wondering what I'm up to. Hmm. If they knew I'd picked up a stranger, they'd send the whole police force after me. Little do they know, I'm not coming back anytime soon. You haven't, like, escaped from anywhere, have you? Yeah, you could say that. But I'm gonna go back. I belong there. I know that. Just not yet. Just taking a little joyride, huh? Joyride. I like the way that sounds, yeah. Sounds kind of dangerous, doesn't it? Just on a little joyride. Let me off here! Are you sure? Right... right here. Okay. Thanks. ♪♪♪ Oh, my God. Hi! Uh... Uh. Excuse me? Oh, God, I'm sorry. Jeez. I'm the asshole. You know, I actually have something that can fix that if you hold on for, like, one second. I'll be right back, okay? Do you wanna sit down? - Yeah. - Okay. Do you need help with your dress? - I'm fine. - Okay. Right. My name's Jane, by the way. - Rose. - Hi. I've had to glue my daughter's shoes together, like, a million times, so, let me see what I can do, okay? Okay. That's such a pretty dress. I hate this dress. I look like a tissue box hooked up with a virgin Mary candle. I hate this neighborhood, I hate this whole thing. You know, my grandma's, like, totally forcing me - to do all this. - Do what? Have this quinceañera. Wear this dress. Uh, she's even making me dance to Mexican music. Maybe she's trying to get you to embrace the culture? She's from Albuquerque. She's never even been to Mexico. Uh... Okay. Do you know what they call high heels in Mexico? Oh, you should - probably wait a second... - I'll be fine. Okay. Stupid dress and stupid pair of high heels. Okay. I don't think I'm gonna be able to glue those back together now. They call them tacones, by the way. High heels. In Mexico. This is awesome. Are you sure this place sells shoes? Trust me, you can get new tires for your car here. Cool, I've lived here for years, I never even knew it was here. She said you look beautiful. You know it was my parents who wanted to "Americanize" me? In my old neighborhood, I got shamed for not speaking Spanish. I'm like, "Well, why don't you speak German? My family got here in 1890, what's your excuse?" Hey, at least you're in a new neighborhood now. It's worse. Now I get shamed by other Latinos because I'm too white. You're gonna get through this, all right? 'Cause I got you. What, are you, like, white Oprah or something? Hm, what do you think of these zapatos? You say that weird. Oh, that's 'cause I did a study abroad in Madrid. My God, something smells amazing. Oh, I'm so hungry. Do you wanna get food after this? It's my treat, I'll pay. Okay. Do you cook a lot of Mexican food at home? Yeah, I do. For my grandpa. My grandma makes me. And then she's always talking about the old ways and how I should be more like that. Well, what do you want? I don't want her to be mad, but I also wanna be me. Everyone struggles to find a version of themselves that they like. Have you? Okay, the dress. You hate it. Why? It's huge. But it was my mom's. And I miss her. Well, you know, maybe your grandma misses her too. Yeah. Yeah, it still doesn't make it right for her to make me dance to Spanish music with a bunch of strangers. She's... she doesn't care about anything I like. So, what do you like? - Billie Eilish. - Hey, I like Billie Eilish too! ♪ I'm a bad guy ♪ These are more me. Yes, I agree. Oh, my God, I hate heels. ♪♪♪ All right, here we go. - Food. - Thank you. Don't you think we should get you back? I'm sure your grandma's worried about you. I really don't feel like going back yet. I get it, I mean, being your age is so tough. - It sucks. - Yeah. I'm still traumatized from being a teenager. When I was your age, my friend, Allison Janson, stole my boyfriend. - What a B. - I know, right? And the worst part about it though is that I never even said anything to her about it, and that part, it still eats at me, and... I don't want your quinceañera to haunt you when you're an adult, so I would love for you to find a way to, like, own this day. I'll dye my hair. That... that is not what I meant. You said it yourself! No, I didn't say anything to you about dyeing your hair. Didn't you say I need to find a version of myself that I like? What is your grandma gonna say about that? Look, I'm tired of always making other people happy. All right! Okay, it's the moment of truth. Okay, all right. Oh, my God, I can't believe we're doing this. Dude, my grandma's gonna kill me. Oh, my God. Well, you know what? Everybody's gonna wanna dance with you now. - What? - At your quinceañera. Dancing... Oh. - Okay, come on. Stand up. - What? Stand right there. I'm gonna show you. - It's so easy. - Okay. Okay, your arms are like this, and you step back with your right foot. One, two, three, four. You know what, it's so much easier in real life because you just let the boy lead even though most of the time, they don't know what they're doing. That's sexist. You're right, it is. All right, what're you gonna do if it's not a waltz, though? What do you mean, like freestyle? Yeah, like freestyle. How're you gonna freestyle? - Like a little of this. - Oh! - Okay! All right. - Little of that. Yeah, move it all around. We can go down. Okay, we dyed your hair, it's time to go home. Wait. What about you? - Oh, I am not dying my hair. - No. What version of yourself do you wanna be? Oh, God, I don't know. I feel like I just think about everybody else all the time, I don't... I don't even know. Sounds exhausting. Maybe it's time to straighten out Allison Janson. I'm not gonna call Allison Janson. I mean, how many other Allison Jansons have there been? Okay. That is a fair point. I have an idea. Come on. No, I feel like you just don't wanna go home. Maybe I don't. Oh, my God. Come on. Tell Allison what's up. Uh, I'm... I'm mad at you. How was that? I encourage violence. Fine, I'll do it, I'll do it. I hate you, Allison Janson. I'm still mad because you stole my boyfriend, and I never even said anything to you about it. God, and I hate you, Courtney Lynn, for mommy shaming me! And I really hate you, Dave, because you left me, because I made one stupid mistake. And I hate you, Jane, most of all, because you care what everybody thinks, and you don't even care about yourself. God! Oh, my God, that actually - felt kind of good. - Yeah.

Did you steal that from Captain Lou Albano? - Oh, I'm so glad to... - From the, uh, WWF? The WWF? Oh, before the merger. Oh! You knew that? That was very sexist of me. It's really comforting to know that your jokes haven't changed at all. Yeah, I really peaked in tenth grade. Yeah, that was, like, a great year for me. - This is... - Right. I don't...

Amazing. - Through the haze. - She's eight. - No way. - Mm-hmm. Oh, please, tell me she's still in diapers just to make me feel less old. - I guess that would be weird. - How would that - make you feel better? - Well, you know, - she's still a baby. - She's eight, - she's not a baby. - What's she doing? - She's at camp. - Oh. - Where, specifically? - Why? It's a thing, I collect addresses of kids camps like stamps. Don't worry about it. She's somewhere in the general Malibu area. Is it one of those, like, super genius camps? Where they make robots and stuff? It's a regular kid camp. - Canoeing and cabins, and... - I see. So they make robots that can row in a canoe. That's next year. That's advanced. You, um... like, what, single? Married? Oh, my God. What... what is this? Mu... multiple husbands? - God. I am single. - All right. What was that guy's name, years ago. - Dave. - Dave. Dave, remember how he was always like, "It's Dave. Not David." That's all I remember of him, I think I had, like... - one drink with him. - Mm-hmm. He was like, "Please don't call me David." He was, like, a felon, right? No. He's just a regular run-of-the-mill asshole. - Okay. - Why are you acting like you don't know anything about my life? I see you lurking on my Instagram stories. Lurker is what I have my Instagram set to. That's all the accounts I lurk in. But your dog, that's usually why I'm on there, 'cause... so many handkerchiefs and fun setups that him look half-human. - What? - You know, like... - Half-human? - Well, you know, because you, like, dress him up in people clothes. - He has all the sweaters. - God, it's pretty normal to put a cute little handkerchief on your dog. See, this is what I'm talking about, now you sound crazy. How are you? Uh, you know, we're good, it... you know, as you know, um, Melissa and I were separated for a while, a while back, but, well, then we had a baby, which, you know, fixes everything. You had another kid? Yeah, you know. Seemed like, you know, the mature thing to do. It turns out, uh, that doesn't necessarily help a marriage, uh, as you have a child that is up all the time, but, that said, you know, we have gone to therapy a lot, and we have worked on it and we have worked on it, and, you know, like, we're... it's... It's this great new place. And it's, uh, totally different, and good, and I think it's a good spot. - It was a lot of work, but... - Wow. I... I'm kind of amazed, you're, like... Like a mature human being? You're, like, a full adult now. Yeah. Oh, look. That guy escaped from Jimmy Buffet's band. Margaritaville for life. I need you to know that it's actually okay. Is it? Are you sure? 'Cause if even... It's okay, it's okay. Just sorry that I didn't stay in contact. I really am. You did, you know, in your own way. You'd, like, DM me at 3:00 a.m. You know, you could've called, but you didn't, so... Get, like, three glasses of wine in me and then... It's my best DMing time. I mean, I'm... I'm sorry. I think it... I think it actually really hurt my feelings when you ghosted me. It was just a bad joke, too, and I don't know when to stop. It's okay. I... I feel like now that I know your whole situation, I actually really respect what you did, because you didn't run away from your responsibilities, so... Yeah, now you just know I'm half a piece of shit. You're not. No, I am. But, uh, you know. Thank you for understanding, - 'cause I was... - You're not. - You... you would. - No, I wouldn't. - Really. - You really... - You would... - I would not. ...'cause I know that you're a good person, so I know you would understand. - No I'm not. - You are. You really are. Yeah, sometimes, uh... I wish things were different. Me too. But, you know... People change, and, um, maybe... Maybe if you really knew me, you wouldn't even really like me that much so... Jane, you're still the same. - No, I'm not, I swear to you... - No, that... - That's a compliment. - No, I... I've... I'm not the same person, - I'm not. - No, it's why I love you. - No, please don't say that. - You know that. Please don't say that. I am not joking. - I always have. - No. I'm not trying to start anything, I swear. I'm not. It's just... in some other world, some other time... we would've been together. Yeah, I mean, maybe, yeah. Why'd you do that? I'm so glad I went running. Okay. - Let's do it. - All right. - Okay. - Okay? - All right. - Let's run away. Right now. If you say the word, I'll run away with you. Just say it. Let's go. No, I can't, I can't. - I can't do it, I can't. - Jane. - Eight years ago... - Jesus. ...I screwed up. I regret it every day. We were both free. Let's run away. - Come on. - I think... I can't, because I don't want you to do that to your family. I don't wanna be the reason that you do that to your kids. I don't wanna be the reason that you leave your wife. You're not the reason, it's me. You're gonna regret it, I swear, you're gonna regret it. A little. It doesn't... - Oh, a little? - It doesn't matter... When your kids hate you, and everyone says that you're so terrible, because you left your wife? I don't wanna do that to you. And you don't even really know me. I mean, it was one night eight years ago, I swear to you, I'm so annoying, you wouldn't really like me that much if you dated me. You can be annoying. But you were annoying in seventh grade when I first met you, when you transferred up from Reizenstein. How do you remember that? Because there was a light around you as you sat at your desk, and I was like... there's an angel right there. No, no... - And then you talked to me. - No. It's... it... it can't... This is, like, a fantasy projection, and maybe I've thought about it, okay? - But I... I... - Yeah, you thought about it. I thought about it. We thought about it. Okay, all right. All right, Jesus Christ, but... Look, I'm not gonna regret a single thing, you said it. It was statistically impossible that we would be together. Right now at this moment we are here right now. I don't even know if it's real, but I hope it is. Okay, but what... what if the reason that we ran into each other is 'cause we just needed to see each other, and have closure, and just be able to walk away, and... and never think about it ever again? I've had this conversation a thousand times with you. I've had it so many times, you have no idea. - Let's go. - I can't. Let's finally go and do it. No, I don't wanna do that to you. I... I don't think I would like you if you did that. I've thought about this so many times. And now you're here, and you're saying it. You're saying everything I ever wanted you to say, but I can't do it. - I have to say no, because... - Jane, please. - No, because there's... - Please, please. ...something more important, there's something more important than just being happy, okay? And that's what I've realized, so I want you to just go home. Go home, and look at your kids, okay? Go home to your family. And it'll be okay. Just don't think about it. All right? And I'll be okay. And you'll be okay. All right, there's just some things you have to live with, okay? Okay? Okay.

Jane? This is she. Before you say yes or no, I want you to know something. Every man and every woman is a star. I can't believe you still have my number. I never forget talent. I have something new for you. Something you love. It's this afternoon. I'll text you the address. Oh, I don't... Oh, um, I don't think that I have time. Sorry. Jane, you're going to spend a day hiding in your car, an iced americano in your hand, wondering if you made the right decision. Jane. Take off your glasses. There are some choices that are more honest than others. But there are no mistakes. Should we expect you? What's the role? 5:30. And bring some flowers. God gave me nothing and he took it all. Wait. Not like that. God gave me nothing and then he took it all away. God gave me nothing and then he took it all away. God gave me nothing. And then he took it all away. And then he took it all away. You gave me nothing... and then you took it all away. You gave me nothing. And then you... took it all... Hi. Hi. What time's your call? - 5:30. - Oh, me too. I'm Jane. Who are those for? Hello? We're ready. Shh! I'm glad you came. Do you have questions? Good. Grab the chair. Move it in the center of the room. Sit. Don't move or speak unless you have an impulse to. We want to know you. Thanks. Open your mouth. And close it. Open and stretch, stretch your face. Closing it. And stretch it. Close it and shake it out. Good. Relax. You don't have to worry about your lines. What lines? Hold out your hands. Palms up. And down. And up. And down. And up and down, and up and down, and up and down, and up. Ow. Close your eyes. Open your eyes. Look at your hands. Who do they belong to? Are you ready... to wash yourself of yourself? Do you remember how? I think you're full of shit. Oh, come on. Something real. I want to hear your real voice. Oh, come on. Again. Again. Do you remember the long dark stretch before the world became your world? The self became yourself? Scream! Are you trying to mess me up? You're bleeding. When I tell you to stay in the car, it's not a suggestion, it's a request, okay? I expect you to stay in the car. You can't just go disappearing like that, do you understand? Do you understand me? I can't believe this, like you just wanna mess things up. Hi. Um. Hi, sorry, um, that's my car. Excuse me. Sorry! Excuse me! Um... - this is my car. - This is my job. I need you to respect that. I need you to... This is my car. What're... what're you doing? Why can't you be alone for a half hour? I swear to God, you're doing this on purpose. You are trying to make things difficult for me on purpose. Do you hear me? No, wait, wait! - Come back! - Oh, my God. What are you doing? This is my car! This is your fault. This is your fault! - You did this. - What? Wait, no! I have to get my daughter! No! Wait! No, stop! Stop! Where's my phone? There's a breeze, a self-whistling breeze, like a mother kissing your forehead through fever. There's a breeze, a self-whistling breeze... - Hello? - ...like your mother kissing your forehead through fever. There's a breeze, a self-whistling breeze... Hello? Is there anyone still here? Oh, where are you freaks? ♪♪♪ Jane. Jane. You are here now. You are with us. Beautiful work. How do you feel? Oh, my God. Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God. Give me a hug. Big squeeze.
