Every life has a purpose. Life is all about understanding this purpose. Krishna, who was born to Devaki, grew up under Yashoda's care.. Mischievous boy Krishna became the wrestler Krishna and defeated Kamsa.. He preached the holy Bhagavadgeetha to the world... Thus fulfilled his purpose of life Just like that Pailwaan Krishna... Here too a baby Krishna has taken birth... What's the purpose of this Krishna? This is the land of men, Gajendragar! Every grain of sand is alive with bravery and courage! This is Sarkar, senior wrestler... A Bachelor... Although he quit along ago, he still has the wrestling bug He wishes to identify and nurture the local talent.. .. hence he has dedicated his life to wrestling. One day in his life... Three guys ganging up on a kid? The kid himself set a bet to fight them! Sarkar, that boy- Ah, my leg! What a fight! What a fighter! How did you know the boy would win? He has no fear in his eyes... - Hand it over... - Here you go May good attend you! Bye! Wrestler eh? Are you in pain? No pain greater than hunger sir. Where are you from? Where are your parents? I have no one...I'm an orphan With another human by the side, none can be an orphan. Will you come with me? Is it right to bring home this street rat? Have you ever fought for a single meal? That guy struggles... Not for himself, but for others... What guarantee that he won't become a rowdy tomorrow? He who abuses might will become a rowdy. He who has a mighty reason will be a warrior. He is a warrior. Hey, who is it?! What happened? He's running way, Sarkar! Did anyone scold him? No one said anything, Sarkar. I have never seen so much love. I have only been abused. After I get used to all this love, what if you send me away? Hey! You are not just like my son, you are my son! Understand? You will never be sent out of this house. Look...my temple! This gymnasium... Ever since I was a boy, I have been wrestling here. My father, forefathers... all practiced here. I have a dream... will you fulfill it? Anything except studies! Will you become the National Wrestling Champion? Sarkar, my life is yours! As you say... This is the moment The finale of the Fair and Handsome Pro Boxing League! Here's the crowd favorite... King Tony! Come on charge! That was brilliant from Navdeep! No one has challenged Tony like this before! Hey, cheating! Oh brother! Tony, you are making a mistake! Don't cross the limits! Hey old man, winning is the only thing for me. The next round begins... Navdeep tries for a knockout. But Tony counters! - Dad... - Hey! Hey, don't do that Tony! That's fatal! Navdeep is seriously injured. The doctor has been called for! Knockout specialist Tony's ban episode has a new twist! Tony's own coach Vijayendra has stood witness against him! Tony may be banned for five years. His career may be over! Hey old man! I have fed you and clothed you! You dare complain and get me banned? Tony! Forgotten so soon? Who rescued you from the streets? Who trained and made you champ? Get lost! Did all your trainees become champs? I have talent and guts! That's why I'm a champion! There is no boxer like me in all India! Get it? I'll create a new champion... At least to avenge this insult! If you really have the guts, find just one guy! Tony is the best! I'll be waiting! Bring a real man to fight me! Don't be sad, Appa. Tony was my student. I gave him too much affection. Don't worry about it. You will surely find another like him! It's not so easy dear. Tony is a diamond I have shaped with great difficulty. Only diamond can cut diamond. Did you fall brother? I was bowing to mother Earth! - Don't make fun of this, Paapu. - What'd you say? You donkey! I'm Assault Paapanna! Assaulted every wrestler from Kashmir to Kanyakumari! - I know all about you. - What do you know? You haven't fought a single wrestler. They say you've been assaulted by all and sundry. That's why you are Assault Paapanna! Shut your mouth! Here's twenty rupees, have some tea! Stripping away the little dignity I have... Excuse me Just a minute sir! Have some tea and continue practice. - I'm Vijayendra, boxing coach. - Hello! I heard you're disposing of your champ's equipment. Yes sir...-Okay This it sir...

A match of equals, but Kichcha.... ...gains the upper hand! Hey Sarkar, how much have you paid him to throw the match?! Talking ill of Sarkar... Is he some big shot? The eunuch can't even father a child! And we have to fear him??? If he is man enough, ask him to face me. I'll show him! Sarkar... Let it go... This is a 15-point match! Let's see who wins. He will score at least one point...you'll see. The player knows the game, the viewer knows zilch! Five points required... Baljit makes a strong comeback. In a counter-move, Kichcha throws him!

He wins every match No one can face the Pailwaan Born of the soil To face the typhoon This leader of men Don't you dare meet his eye He sees through the window of your heart Immoveable, unyielding The Emperor of our land His mustache has never been muddied Come on Pailwaan He wins every match No one can face the Pailwaan Born of the soil To face the typhoon Hey champion of the world He has no fear Rayanna Sindhoora Lakshmana Born of the same soil as him See this wonder The symbol of courage Our Pailwaan Anjaneyaaya Vidmahe Vaayuputraya Dheemahi Tanno Hanuma Prachodayaat Jai Jai Jai Hanumaaan Every limb like lightning shines Colors of every hue painted Like the spice of Mandakki Mirchi Excitement shines in the eye Cherished by Hanuman himself Let us sing his praise Come on Pailwaan Come on Pailwaan Going where? - Why did you drag me into this? - Did you hear me? To the temple... Temple? I had made a vow that if I won... You made a vow?! - Not me...him - Yes, yes on his behalf! What have you gotten me into... You are going for the Nationals... don't get into fights, police and all that. Sarkar! What are you saying? Fighter in the ring, friend outside! The very image of peace! - Let's go... - Which temple? Now we are finished... - the one in the northern side... - south! First north and then south... Ever seen a goddess before? What a question! What a face! And that light in her face! Those features! Indescribable! That's how wonderful she is... Let's make an escape... That's what I am trying to do... - Overall... - Get going Thank God, let's go! - That way? - Yes, that way... Hey! Idiot, can't you see where you are going? Hey, those scoundrels are coming this way. Whenever injustice on earth becomes intolerable... ...when evil flourishes... ...He will to come end it... Are you joking? Nothing will happen, relax. Bow to the idol... Hey! Do you know who you're laying your hands on? Sorry sir... Did you say something to Sarkar? What did I say? Just try to remember... 'If he is man enough, ask him to face me, I will show him!' - So what now? - Nothing, my lord! Sarkar is my father, mother, god and guru. You said those things about him... ...so I came to inquire. You come to our area and dare confront us? He's come right? What are you going to do? Is that so? Hey! Shut that door! Why this tension? I will shut it. He will shut it don't worry! Why did you ask to shut the door? To thrash him! What are you waiting for then? - You! - Just a minute! - Paapu... - I can't thrash these guys! Didn't ask you to... Sarkar will call, just 'manage' him. As predicted, Sarkar is calling. Sarkar! Don't let him know I called. Cunning duo know each other inside out! I'm trapped in the middle! Tell me, Sarkar! What is he doing? - Breaking... - What?! ...I mean breaking coconuts! Who is this guy? Hey! What are you doing? - Sit properly! - Sitting! Go quickly and visit the god! God has been viewed. He is now distributing sweets! You please proceed with your prayers! What are you saying? Give him the phone! - Krishna? - Yes Sarkar... - Oh auspicious time? - Yes, yes - Get a viewing and come back quickly. - Ok, Sarkar ...I'm Rana's man! Rana who? The king of Ranasthalipura! Does your Rana have horns or something? Let me go! I'll say no more. Never again about Sarkar. Forgive me! A mistake can be forgiven once... that's why... If you say anything else again... I won't say anything! Remove clothes, thrash them, wear clothes again! What is your problem? Hey, you know nothing of Sarkar. - You are such a Paapu... - Oh, God only can understand Who has installed this cutout in the middle of the road? It's a public inconvenience! Get it removed... Hey, who installed this cutout? Sir no idea. I am not from here. - I know nothing, let me go sir! - Hey... Sir you are new to the place. You have no idea whose cutout this is. Is he some leader or patriot? Neither, sir... Who then? He is...the king of our place! For hundreds of years, their family has ruled here. Everyone here venerates him. Any work in this land must begin with him. He decides who the MPs and MLAs are. No one can question his pre-eminence. If you do... What will he do? King or minister, a wrong is a wrong. The law is equal for all. I will remove it myself. How dare you assault the police? My lord, he's a newcomer. He didn't know what he was doing! Not him, it, my lord! I am Rana. Raja Rana Pratap Varma! Governments change, only the king remains! Rana is defined by a certain characteristic. If there's a wedding, I must be the groom. If it's a death, I must be the corpse. The primary honor is always mine. How dare you touch my cutout? No, my lord. I will make him understand. He didn't know he was making a mistake. Sir, let's go... Wait! Salute me! He will, my lord... Sir, salute him...or else he'll kill you. Please salute him! Can't you walk quietly? -Okay, okay... He's sitting right here. What to do? - Beating over? - Huh? - He calls again... - I meant, your beat over? I will use the toilet... No...I won't What is he trying to do here? Where is the offering? No sweets? Offering? The temple was closed when we went. He is joking since morning! No limit to his jokes! Here you go... Not gone home yet? I waited for you to come. They'll be waiting...you go. -Right... I have a doubt. Is this from the northern temple or the southern one? Go, go to sleep.... Eat them and sleep... Brother, laddoos from the temple.-Coming- - You carry on... - Yes, Sarkar... Not you Paapu...carry on Right Sarkar... I thought I managed him on the phone... Did he remove his shirt and thrash them? Thrashed them well? Washed them with dirt! - You take a small boy... - Small boy??! - To a fight? - Me?! I know my son... Anyone who meddles with me, they're finished. He's beating me up instead of him... - Told him all of it? - Yes Can't you shut your mouth? Father and son know each other well...Ah! It's bad times for me.... Put it up... Rukmini Constructions Chairman Gajanand Deshpande... ...suddenly announces his daughter's engagement? Dad fixed the match. He knows what's good for me. Hey come... His father and I are developing a big property in Mumbai. He is their only son. With this marriage, our relationship will grow further. So will my business. For business, you will marry her off to a stranger? Did my mother know my father before marriage? Weren't they happy? They have double my wealth. My daughter will surely be happy. I believe in God. My man will surely take care of me. These are the prospective brides for Krishna. I know my son well. Till he becomes National Champion, he won't marry. Don't try to approach him this way. He's insane... Isn't this a bit too much? Why are you laughing? - I don't believe it! - What? I don't believe you don't drink. Hey, what do you mean you don't believe? I don't believe you... -Hey! I swear on that cat there! If I drink... You know what happens when a pledge is broken right? - I know, I know... - Then? He dares advise me... By the way, why are you drinking? Love failure... Can a question paper fail in an exam? - No... - Who is that fails? - Those who write... - Exactly! Can love ever fail? It's lovers that fail. And you failing is no surprise, Paapu. What do you know about true love? Hey! You just swore you won't drink! Yet you finished it off. Oh right! Don't worry, what can happen? Come here, listen carefully... Love is like a six-pack. Very difficult to achieve. Maintaining it is even harder. But friendship...look down. Your stomach... Like this, it comes easily. After it comes, even if you refuse it... it will stay till death. In such a case, why this love and stuff? Guys who talk this way are the first to fall in love and get married! What are you saying? - Fall in love I say! - Who are you saying it to? To you. - Telling me? - Yes! Sarkar says we must not fall in love... That's why Hanuman and Sarkar are celibates. Me also brahmachaari. I swear on you I won't marry. I won't fall in love. I swear on you! You tell me? Me? Get going home soon! Drunkard! He swore on the cat, and it died! He has sworn on me he won't fall in love... what of me?! If I am to live, he must not fall in love...not marry... I must find a way out. A pair...pick a card. The wedding of Seetha and Rama. Your prospects of a wedding are bright. Your star sign indicates you will marry. Impossible! He is a celibate. He has vowed he won't marry! Don't you... What he's saying is.... I am Hanuman's disciple... - Hanuman himself says it! - What? You will find your Seetha. Go and marry her! Really? Is this guy an astrologer? He's lying for money. Swami, don't just wag your tongue. You dare call my astrology a lie? Hanuman himself will come... ...show you your Seetha. You will see her. When you meet her, Fire, Water, and Wind will be witness to your love! Write this down! Lakshmi, goddess of wealth! If I get it, I can drink tonight! I have to get it somehow! Pappu? He's asking the music teacher to act as Hanuman... - What do I do? - Pappu! Rama! Rama, yes you... No, I'm Krishna...Namaste... Does Hanumantha know Krishna or Rama? Rama... Then? Seetha awaits you there. Go Rama...go! How did Krishna enter the Ramayana? So confusing... Lakshmi, please stop! Where are you going? Lakshmi, where are you going? Stop... I'm coming...got you! Got her...Lakshmi! 'When you meet her, your love will be witnessed by Fire... Water! Wind! I saw Seetha today... Where? What a dignified bearing! How she speaks! Who is he speaking of? Isn't that our tradition? When I see her, I feel...feel... - What do you feel? - Let me tell you... She's like...a pillar of a fire... I feel like worshiping her. I feel the astrologer's predictions will come true... Don't you believe such guys! Hey, Hanumantha himself has said so. See there, that Anjaneya! Let him say so, and I will believe it. Look, look there! Anjaneya has himself indicated it! That's not a lady...it's a body! Look there! Hey, it's you! Can you come here a minute? I am the one she called. You go ahead. I'm in big trouble. Can you please help? Anything! Shall I kill him? Can you go to the wine shop... and get four beers? What did you say? Beer... - Strong... - Strong! - Chilled... - Chilled! What a tradition! Also cigarettes... Cigarette...so cultured! What else? Gutkha... Will you get these for me? - Pillar of fire! Standing, flowing,... - That's it... Here you go... Thank you! Wait here. All of it here. Change! Thank you. He's venting his anger about the girl on the dummy. If it was the girl... Hello, wrestler, which way are you heading? Brother, going to drink water... Going to drink water or... ...pouring water over your achievements? Brother, that girl...love... Hey, love is one big lie. Forget it! What has happened to you? No brother, I see that girl and I think...traditional, cultured... Tradition and culture? You know better than me? If you believe that, you are a dupe! You know sugarcane husk right? -yes- They will squeeze you dry like that! What's wrong with you? You are a wrestler. Only wrestling and the championship in mind. No distractions, do you understand? No distractions... Look and learn. Take this... -what is this?- Wet trunks, wear it. You will cool down. Hey, idle fellow! Get over here. Coming boss. - Search there? - Beer baby! Okay There is a proverb which says 'don't get ants in the pants' I say nothing will happen. Want to see? More gutkha, cigarettes, beer? Our boy will get it. Who? That guy who got it that day for you! - Can we meet him? - Sure, please come! - Krishna! - What? Why are you shouting? - The beer girl is here! - What? She wants more. She thinks you are a beer broker. Show her her place! Get her here. Madam, all set. Please go. Look on boys... The lamb is at the tiger's mercy. Love is finished! I can't bear to see them fight... turn away boys. Krishna will explode now! No idea what will happen after. Let's listen. Hey, no sounds yet? Why? Come sit, please. This is...you are looking good. Krishna, the environment has changed. What is going on? Hey, that cigarette, beer, it's not for them! Some bet with a friend. They have no such habits. Very good person! Innocent! Seetha! Please sit. Pappu listen, Hanumantha and the astrologer were right! So sweet of you... I'm Rukku. - Rukku? - Rukmini! - Lovely name! - Yes, yes - You are? - Krishna! song(Missing) O darling Let's see you wink Hold my hand O pearl among women No space to breathe Only god knows of this heat in me Nothing is in my grasp O darling Let's see you wink Hold my hand O pearl among women The spell of her sidelong glance Slides into my eyes The love story begins The path of joy The boy loses his mind over her jewels With each breath Passion rises O colorful butterfly, o beautiful vision I offer flowers for your hair Time unmoving, hatches in me love The touch of you like lightning strikes The celibacy of youth crumbles to dust He moved carefree and stubborn With your touch, he lost his courage O Kalyani O Kasthuri Come hold my hand O darling Let's see you wink Hold my hand O pearl among women In lieu of the coming Dussehra celebrations... Sri Vijayadurga Institution has organized a special wrestling match! Only four of the foremost wrestlers in Karnataka have been chosen.

Do they have ears? - So why are you whispering? - Anjaneya! Afraid? Afraid to be with me? No no, why should I be afraid? No fear is it? Champion Krishna, from our Karnataka! Yes sir... A pure desi talent from Uttara Karnataka... This who we are searching for... Yes sir, he has trained from a very young age. Please allow him to compete in the Nationals. He will definitely win a medal for India. Please sir... -Do one thing. -Yes At the tournament at Ranasthalipura next month... ...the National selectors are coming. Let him participate, and then we'll see. Definitely sir. He will surely win there. First, let him participate. The only guy who wins there is Raja Rana Pratap Varma. Exciting times at the Vijayadurga Dussehra wrestling competition... Raja Rana Pratap Varma is wrestling with Kolhapur's Vikram Thakore. Rana executes a superb move! It's a terrific confrontation between the two. This is a fight of equals. Raja Rana Pratap Varma scores a fabulous victory! Victory to Raja Rana Pratap Varma! Where is Kichcha, not to be seen? Hey Assault Paapu! Who said Paapu? Oh, mother Seetha! Come, sit here. Hey, sit over there. -My man will be back shortly. -Your man? Your friend... Oh! So many developments in a day! -Just a little... -Not little but too much At this rate, there will be kids. Can you check where he went? He will come. Watch for him okay... Next match, Ranadir Singh and Pailwaan Kichcha! Here he comes...your man! Hi handsome! Hey...I love you... Yay, yes! Yes...! Hey, get lost! Too much Kichcha!-Get lost man!- Which is that line about the mustache? You read it yourself... Hey Krishna! Hi! Hi! Looking happy Rukkamma! What's the urgency? -Errr, Daddy knows... -What? I've told him everything. How suddenly you spring it on me Rukkamma. -Afraid? -...nothing like that...first time... Nothing will happen. Speak carefully okay? Come... -Sir! -Kichcha... Is that your name? No sir, I'm Krishna. Kichcha is my nick name. Sounds so stupid. Here's a blank cheque. Fill in any amount you want. Are you thinking of how much to write... ...or you don't know how to write? I haven't studied sir, so I don't know writing. Thumb impression...-yes- -Suits you! Not surprised. Okay, I will fill it in. Tell me the account details. No account as well? No sir, but I don't know why you're asking. I know why you are behind my daughter... ...and I know what you want. Oh like that... I've not raised my daughter for a street loafer like you. Sir! Where are you going? That is...shutting my mouth and pushing off! Because, you'll say something, and I will respond. It'll suddenly blow up into something else. That's why... But if you say yes, I can speak! Sir, I too got fooled like others. Your palatial house, your cars... I thought you were a big man! Dude! We mustn't speak of ourselves, but listen anyway. I can't write, but outside... ...the elderly and young are filled with their love of me. That's all I want. No account, but I have gathered some respect in the form of friends. A rupee each with love from them, and I'll have more than you. 'If you tangle with me...if you do...' I'm not one who speaks that way. No need. One last thing! How can a guy like you have a daughter like that? How? This I can't understand. Also, I will always be your girl's husband... ...so I will be your son-in-law. Write it down. See you soon! See you soon! I've told you everything. Think of it from a girl's father's point of view. I have fixed her marriage. What... -When is the wedding? -Next month You prepare for the wedding. I give you my word. There will be no trouble from my son. That's the way. Give me five! Whose car is that? This Chinna always teases me this way... -Kichcha sir! Namaskar! Can we speak? Carry on. I thought we shared the same dream so far. Is it still the same? Or has it changed? Why are you saying such things Sarkar? You aim to be champ or not? Of course! Why are you speaking this way? Really? Or has something else become important? No Sarkar...what else...nothing! The National selectors are coming to Ranasthalipura. Set aside all distractions. Got it? Focus on wrestling...go 'You aim to be champ or not?' 'Has something else become important?' 'Focus on wrestling.' What is all this Kichcha? Nothing Appaji...the bike... What didn't happen all these years... ...how come suddenly today? Where was your focus, Kichcha? Appaji... Focus on wrestling. A slight distraction, and you will lose your life. He who sets aside desires, sacrifices himself and overcomes obstacles... ...only he can be a true wrestler. Only him! Don't waste all these years of sacrifice and hard work. Sister... We welcome our king Raja Rana Pratap Varma to the National Wrestling Championships at Ranasthalipura. We also welcome Sarkar from Veerajaneya Gym and the National Selectors. After these junior competitions, the most awaited match! Gajendragar's Pailwaan Kichcha versus Raja Rana Pratap Varma! Where is your son? He will come sir. The junior competitions are at an end. We request the competitors of the next match to get ready. Sarkar, today is that girl's marriage. Rukku...-looking so pretty- Smile! Pailwaan Kichcha has not yet arrived. This has disappointed the spectators. If he doesn't show up, -Scared to even show up! ...Raja Rana Pratap Varma will be declared winner! I have always fought every match I have won. He might come any minute, right Sarkar? He will come... Let us wait. Our Pailwaan has arrived! Bravery should be exhibited in wreslting arena... ...Not by doing accident And Kichcha wins the match with that move! Tear down his cutout! -Down with Rana Pratap! -Kichcha! You don't know the results of your mistakes! No one has spoken to Sarkar like this before! Dear, your father... Sarkar, these two didn't know this would happen. Poor children, they had no idea. You know all about Sarkar. You too know all about him... -I don't! -That is... -I don't know who stands in front of me! This is not the child I raised. Sarkar, what are you saying? He is your child.... Just because you're a friend, don't cross your limits. I wondered if I could trust. This is betrayal of trust. I will ask two things. Ask if your husband will make it happen. Definitely...He will do what you say. He must stop training and wrestling from now on. Let him live happily... out of my sight! Sarkar, what are you saying? You are asking him to leave! Where will he go? He is your son...your son. You will send your own son away? The girl wanted to kill herself... that's why he got her home. Krishna, come! For the first time, my god asks something of me, Murthy... I will give him my life. That was the last we saw of him. We don't know where he went or how he is doing. He is not in touch with anyone since. You sinner! You murderer! -Yes, me You said you won't sign itseems? - Yes -Not even on the pain of death! -Good! -O dear...let her go -Appa! Why did you get her here? Please! Please let her go! I will sign on anything! -What did you say? -I will sign... Good!!! Shall I read this once? 'My son suffered from a heart problem'. 'He didn't disclose it, and fought in the match'. 'The doctor's certificate says this is why he died'. 'I swear that this is the truth'. -All good...but -But? If your coach doesn't appear at the court... The ban will be surely revoked. -Check this shop... -No, not good How much? Can't reduce it...hey! Hey, look where you're going! Brother, why this panic? What happened? -He is right here! I saw him! -Who? Pailwaan... Who is he? Where? There... What do you need brother? Biscuits for her. Wait here... -That cream biscuit. -Rukkamma! Where are you? In your Heart... -Come quickly! -Why? Feeling shy? -Principal waiting! -Okay... Sister, what's special today? -Our wedding anniversary! -Really? My gift to you... May you live long and well.

Nothing... So much time to make a throw! Get out...you next! Right Sarkar. Quick! Useless fellows! Looking for Krishna? Looking for Krishna in everyone. None of them is Krishna. It's not possible for them too. I have forgotten him. You can't, and that's why you gave away his gear. You sent him out of the house... ...but not from your mind. -All good, Kichchanna? -Yes.. Rukkamma! Looking very nice. What's the matter? You know what is special today? Today... Yes!!!. There will be festival in our village. The first ritual... the wrestling will begin in a week.

Oh, this fellow shows us men in poor light... Master... Brother, I saw Pailwaan Kichcha! What are you saying? Say it again! I saw him... Living happily with his wife and kid. Come quickly brother! Hello brother...that's the house. PAILWAAN What can I offer you? Your husband has given me enough. But I'll still take some milk... How are you Kichcha? I'm good. You? Not good. Not good for the past four years. You just didn't defeat me in our village that day... You broke our family's pride, respect! In our village, I am the groom in any wedding... acceptable. Accepted! I'm the corpse when there is a death...all fine. But you came to my wedding and made me the corpse. That I can't tolerate. I feel anyone who laughs is laughing at me! I can't step out of the house. If you feel like striking me, do so. I'm right here. No! I'm very relaxed now. Now that I have met you. Milk... My blessings... It's you who said, the victory must occur in the ring. You must come to my village. As a Pailwaan. And I must win over you. That Pailwaan won't come Rana. He will come! He will, because I will bring him. You know something? This laborer business doesn't suit you. As a Pailwaan...super! Where is your daughter? Such a sweet child it seems. Where is she? The Pailwaan must step out. I will fetch him. Hey old man, where are you? Come out! Come, come! Hey Tony! Hey coach!...sorry, ex-coach! Tomorrow's headlines! Read it. Champion Tony's ban revoked! Tony is back! He's back! What do you understand from this? The world needs winners! What is a loser like you doing with your life? Oh yes, you have this big 'bakery'. Producing all these 'biscuits'... You are crossing a line. You will definitely lose one day. You dream too big. You will make Tony lose? You may not even be alive next year. What do you say? But this year, if you have a suitable sample... bring it along. Let's see... Anyone you get will be... Shall I get you tea brother? No Ramanna. -Karim bhai... -Tell me Krishna Sorry to bother you this late. No problem...tell me, Krishna. Karim bhai, I needed money for Jaanu's admission. My son, you don't have to beg me for Jaanu's fees. Come in the morning. I will give you the money. Thank you Karim bhai. I will return it soon. -Karim bhai! -Krishna! What happened? What could have happened? How are you Kichcha? I will bring the Pailwaan to my land. Getting angry?...No? No problem...I have waited four years. I can wait a few more days. The Pailwaan must come. Till then, I won't give up. Feel like beating me up? Do it! No, I want to say something to you. Don't mistake my silence for fear Rana. It's respect. If you respect wrestling and your opponents... Wrestling will respect you back. Had I lost to you that day, I'd be happy to have lost to a great wrestler. The sport is bigger than us Rana. I have promised Sarkar, who taught me wrestling. I stand by my promises. You are fooled if you think the Pailwaan will come. He won't... -Hello dear... -Yes dad Which garage did you say? -Basha garage, dad... -Basha garage...okay Sorry Karim bhai. I caused this to happen. Let it go Krishna. I am fine. Krishna, you wanted the money right? Krishna... Basha garage... -Salaam, how can I help you? -Namaskara My car is dented. Can you check? Please sit sir. I will take care of it. -Suleiman check the car. -Yes bhai Stop right here See you brother!!! Krishna, if you don't mind, can I ask you something? -Sure...-Does Jaanu need to go to that big school? Why are you asking? For the rent you pay for that hovel... ...you are working like a donkey. -Brother, why does the mother carry her child on the waist?-Why? So the child can see what the mother sees. But why does the father carry the child on his shoulders? So the child can see what we can't! This is not a difficulty but a desire. And I'm a strong father! Hey Krishna, a good man like you will encounter no difficulties! My mistake, shouldn't have asked! I am reduced to this state after giving away to others! Now I am learning the business. Brother, we will work for Rs. 40,000/- Otherwise not possible. This is a TV ad. Boxing ad...very less money. Lots of work brother. We too are many. We can't work for so less... Let's go. What about you? I'll do the work, brother. What about co-workers? I have none, but I can do it. Just give me what you offered them. Just you? Lots of work, you know. I will do it. The material is there. Take it. Right brother, thanks. - Shekri - Yes brother - Check if he does the work correctly. - Okay I always thought money was the only thing. I gave no value to humanity and humaneness. I thought Krishna wanted to marry my daughter for money. But he showed me I was wrong. I am not here to make you suffer sir. I wanted to speak my mind. One day, I couldn't find my daughter for an hour. I searched everywhere, but couldn't find her. A three-year-old missing for an hour... ...and I almost felt like dying. Whereas you raised your daughter for twenty two years... ...and I took her away in an instant. How you must have felt... Now I understand, sir. Forgive me. Dad...Jaanu! How are you dad? That's when I realized... ...humanity is important, not money. I came that day to rant to you... ...not about Krishna marrying my daughter... ...but because my business deal went awry. I am not a good father, Sarkar. He is... You, who raised him, are a good father. I beg you to forgive me for a mistake I knowingly committed! No dear, I'm waiting here. Yes, meal over. - Sir hello! - Hello, Paapu... Where is our Kichcha? Here...I could only find his photo. I saw his photo at your gym. This is him right? Yes... Yes...this is our Kichcha. Sir, what are you looking at? Advertisement for the annual boxing tournament. Every time, the trophy was ours. But this time... By-two tea, please. Sir, the photo... - How much? - Ten bucks... - Photo of Basha's garage... - Huh? You know this mechanic? Yes indeed... - Him? - That's Krishna He's my neighbor. - A minute... - Hello? RANASTHALIPURA Welcome again to Ranasthalipura, Kichcha. I knew you'd come, that's why I called all the leaders around. Hey, all of you raise your heads. When he won that day, you all applauded and danced. You stomped on my cutout. Today, I will win. You will celebrate and dance the same way. Let me go! Appa! Jaanu! Jaanu! Where are you going? I'm talking to you. He's just a watchman. Tell me... Have you come as a father... ...or a wrestler? A father has come to fetch his daughter. Dear! Let me go! Where is your arrogance now? You are getting thrashed so easily... Pailwaan! Pailwaan! Pailwaan! I want the Pailwaan! Up! Dear! Come on guys push! Dear...Jaanu! Stop! He must still wrestle me. Hey! What is the drama about your promise to your father? You are an orphan, that's all. Where is the Pailwaan in you? Where? He's dead. Dead? Dead? Kill the girl... Appaa... Jaanu... My granddaughter! Don't even think of harming her! I'll cut you to pieces. You shouldn't have made this one mistake. So far, one set of accounts... From now on, we'll have a second account. You shouldn't have woken up the lion. I told you not to make mistakes. Never said you should tolerate them! We need such guys in the police department! Save me...save me! Arrest him!...He's a policeman! I'm just a watchman sir... - Hey... - Hey... - I'm sorry! - I'm sorry! Can I speak to you please? Why didn't you come to see me all these days? My mistake, darling, mistake... My father says, Sarkar never makes a mistake. - Your dad said that? - Yes... I wasn't much of a believer... But now I believe. This mace led me to you from nowhere. It showed me your true form. Krishna and Kamsa were both wrestlers. Krishna fought for Dharma... ...and Kamsa for Adharma. The guy I trained for so long... ...I didn't know he'd be Kamsa one day. He is a stain on the sport of boxing. I don't care if you think I'm selfish. To erase this stain, you must leave the wrestling pit and enter the boxing ring. - Is there money? - What? Money in boxing? Yes... How much money? I don't know Sarkar. But I need the money for those children. Children? Children...When I left home, I expected difficulties... ...but it was very difficult. Difficulty not as a laborer or poor man... ...I suffered since I didn't have you or wrestling. Dad...hi! I couldn't sleep. I would go running all night. I thought I could tire myself to sleep. I thought I suffered the most, but life showed me differently. Those children... Time for a meal, come. You only worry about food. First work, then food. Shantakka, keep it there... - Give it to me, I'll do it. - She's the boss now - Sushila? - Brother! Life was difficult at home. After father died, we all moved here. Initially, it was tough... but now we are used to it. It's like I have forgotten how to run. Where is Chinna? He's not here. Where is he? He didn't want to come here. He always wanted to be a cricketer. One day, mother scolded him to send him to work. He refused saying he wanted to play cricket and ran off. - Where are you going? - I won't work! Don't go there. Chinna! We were the ones who laid that road afterwards. It hurts so much... But we're used to it now. What brings you here? How long Sushila? Sir, coming. Brother, the supervisor is calling. I'm so happy to see you. We live close by. Come again. I will go now brother. God gives everyone dreams. He also gives them hunger. That hunger can eat up every dream. Brother! Come...will you do something for me? Yes brother... I will look after you very well. You must play again like before. Come with me. I will care for you. Don't worry brother. Why? You don't believe me? I know you will keep your word. Will you come? All these kids were like Chinna and me. That's Divya, taluk-level kho kho player. That's Shruthi, kabbaddi player. Here is Mahesha, district-level volleyball player. Life has dragged all these people here. How can I come away alone? We are not fortunate enough to play. You are a good man. You want to fulfill at least her wishes. So many children right here, then how many in Karnataka? Will you fulfill all their wishes? Those who have hunger have no food. And those with food...no hunger. You need good fortune for everything. 'We are not fortunate enough to play'. Pole stars Pole stars Thousands of them Reside on earth too Without twinkling live in sorrow Pole stars Pole stars trapped under the wheel of time O why this unwanted gift? Piercing the eyes, right in front The mirror of irony How can I describe How can I bear Inciting a desire to climb the hill He breaks your leg In his gamble We are all victims Every drop of rain must turn into a pearl The time of human celebration must come A life of fairness we want this day Pole stars trapped under the wheel of time O why this unwanted gift? What talents Sarkar...little kids. Little kids They can't afford two meals a day. So they have packed off their dreams and set them aside. Working as coolies. I feel terrible. With another human by the side, no one is an orphan. A human is not someone who selfishly lives for himself. You taught me that one must help and show the way to his neighbors. If my boxing can help their future, I will definitely fight. If you agree... I only taught you to wrestle... ...but you have learnt why one must wrestle. Even as a child, you fought for others. Even today you want to do the same. I'm proud to say you are my son! He who fights because he is mighty is a rowdy. He who fights for a mighty cause is a warrior. O warrior o gallant one You shall be the winner It is you, the world is yours Let the earth explode, the sky shake You fearlessly face the world He who has a goal will win renown Only a man with a mind will rise Be victorious Surge forward It is you, the world is yours Surge through the crowd He who gets through wins Let the cyclone in you awake Defeat is worse than death The hero must never lose Your lineage is of the warrior Hanuman Rise... Who will break whose records Who knows of tomorrow? Write your own history You are the mighty one He who has a goal will win renown Only a man with a mind will rise Be victorious Surge forward It is you, the world is yours Life is a journey on the sea Thunder and rain are natural The heart that swims to the bank is human This age is the servant of victors You are your own guru Learn to win It all begins here He who has a goal will win renown Only a man with a mind will rise Be victorious Surge forward It is you, the world is yours This is the day, time, and moment we were waiting for all this while! This the first day of the Fair and Handsome Pro Boxing League. We have twelve boxers from all across the globe. They will fight over 25 days in the tournament. Every match is a knockout match. The winner takes home rupees ten crore! The crowds are filling the stands. Now, everybody's favorite, the knockout specialist Tony Sebastian! Here's the knockout specialist King Tony! Look at the power of his walk...red hot! Yes, but he has a tough opponent in front of him. Tony faces the 7-foot tall tiger from Punjab, Kuljit Singh! Red...Blue! He is so huge! How tall is he! To meet his eye, we need an elevator! A suitable opponent for Tony today. - The match is bound to be amazing... - Fight! Here we go! This is what I call sheer power! Krishna... The next match is between Eugene from West Africa... ...and our desi wrestling champ Pailwaan Kichcha! This is Kichcha's first appearance in the boxing ring. That too in such a grand stadium! Here's Eugene, the swagger! Follow my orders throughout the match No foul play, no rabbit punches...ok? - Eugene tries intimidation! - He's doing it deliberately! Ready!. Move!. The bell rings...-Fight! -Here we go! Boxing is not about strength but techniques too! -Kichcha, super! -Break! Oh my god! Pailwaan Kichcha is using a wrestling move. Fight! -This is hilarious! -Come on Kichcha! Eugene is in displaying his boxing skills Break... Now! That's the second warning. You can't do that... Fight!. That's the third warning.... Next time you would be disqualified -Bell...back to your corner... -That's the bell! The crowd is having a real good time. Listen to me carefully! This is boxing not wrestling. He is doing the opposite of what you're thinking. You should beat him at his own game. Focus and counter him. Blue...red... The second round begins. - Kichcha, don't let him go! - Kichcha tries a punch. He is unable to connect... But Eugene connects Strike him, come on. - Eugene takes full advantage! - Punch him! Eugene escapes like thin air. Are you serious?! What a hit! Superb! Come, don't worry about him. Hey bakery, how shall I eat up your little biscuit? Hit...hit him! Go! Attack. Kichcha, use the hook. Hit him! Move...move...move! Oh no! Congrats Tony! How are you feeling? Feels like a holiday! Tony, what do you want to say about your opponent? Pailwaan Kichcha! Ooh...I'm scared! - Pailwaan Kichcha... - Namaste! What do you say about your opponent Tony? Tony is a great boxing talent. I'm happy to get a chance to box with him. You have left wrestling to enter boxing. Why? - For the money... - Money?! Not for me... There are talented underprivileged kids on the street. If someone inspires them, tomorrow... ...they will become great sports persons of this country. That's what I believe. Tony, what do you want to say about this finale? It's going to be short... ...crisp and short! Pailwaan Kichcha! Will you win? I don't know if I'll win, but this I know. I have never accepted defeat easily. The new ray of hope for talented and underprivileged kids...Pailwaan Kichcha! Moving from wrestling to boxing, Kichcha... ...is endearing himself for his purpose. Children need sport as much as studies. Everyone must support games for children. I was a state-level volleyball player in school. But no one helped me progress further... Kichcha is an example to both the state and the country. His purpose is very praiseworthy. Our employees are donating a day's salary to encourage children's sports. If he fulfills his aim, our children too can play. If he wins, our children will win. God bless him! Kichcha has won the hearts of people, but will he win against Tony? We have to wait and watch! This is the moment we've been waiting for! This grandeur and excitement of the finale! Tony Sebastian vs Pailwaan Kichcha! He who has walked nine steps can easily walk the final one. But you can't reach your goal without that final step. The journey will not be complete. Sir, please come! Sir, it's the finals. If you don't come... The moment I found an opponent for Tony... I already reached my goal. Today is not my fight. It's his. This day must belong to him. He definitely doesn't need me today. The purpose with which he has entered the ring... ...will fuel his strength. Welcome to the grand finale of the Fair and Handsome Pro Boxing League! Introducing first, the desi wrestler... Pailwaan Kichcha! Here's King Tony. Please welcome the knockout specialist... Tony Sebastian! Red.. Blue... To the centre Alright then... Let's do the drill once again... You know the rules... but I still gonna repeat a few of them Incase of a Knock Down, you go to the corner I tell you to -Any Questions? -Tony sending out a strong message... The fireworks have already begun! Which means more sparks will fly! -Fight! Kichcha tries to attack, but in vain! A shower of punches on Kichcha before he can even react! This is very tough for him. The punch must have surely damaged the ribs! Stop! Back to your corners... Sit Kichcha! Kichcha seems to be in a lot of pain... ...but looks determined. Good to see him charge... You can do it. Thrash him...don't let him go! The third round is set to begin. Come on Kichcha! -He looks very determined... Go back! Come on! -Come on, go... Move out! A nasty blow from Tony... Tony's coach asking him to watch out! Well done Kichcha! Stop, that's banned! -Oh my god... -Both the teams trying to separate the warriors. -Go back! This match is up and alive! This is anybody's game from here. Kichcha, terrific! You can..C'mon...C'mon Round 4, and the game has now truly begun! Both boxers are tearing each other apart... This is insane.. This is truly a war! First time Tony sits in his corner... He looks exhausted! -Round 8...fight! -That's the start of Round 8. What a match! What a finale! Come on, hook! Thrash him! 1..2.. 'You are my son.' 'I'm proud to call you my son.' 'He who fights because he's mighty becomes a rowdy'. 'He who fights for a mighty cause...' 'We are not fortunate enough to play' '...becomes a warrior' Look! I see some movement! Kichcha is moving! Are you okay? Ready to box? Referee asks if he can continue. He says yes! -Fight! -The Pailwaan is in bad shape... -Doctor, examine! The referee has called for the doctor. Yes, Kichcha's eye is completely shut! The doctor may disqualify him. The match will finish this way. Tony will obviously become the winner. Can you see? Alright.. How much is this? Five! That's good.. Ok I'll close your eyes... Tell me now.. How much? -Focus and look Kichcha. -How much? Four! Good...now? Tell me.. How much? Two! -Good to go! -That's a thumbs up! Now Kichcha on the attack! Tony's taking a beating, but he hits back! This is a street fight...no-holds barred! Tony looking to finish Kichcha... -Come on... -Kichcha come on! That's a cheap shot... That's a foul! That's a warning! You can't do that. Now he hits back. Go Kichcha go! Left hook...another...and another! Oh my god! He's raining blows like tracer bullets! 1...2... 3...4 8...9...10! -He's out! -Yes! Winner of the Fair and Handsome Pro Boxing League By means of knockout...â€¨is Pailwaan Kichcha! Sir... Sarkar, Where is Pailwaan Kichcha? Sarkar, your son is not to be seen? My son has gone to realize my dreams.
