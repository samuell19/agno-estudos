TIME OF INDIFFERENCE - Are you asleep? - No. I was thinking about the dress. 18th-century, it would suit you well. Yes, but the white wig? It's useless, doesn't go with my skin. And I'll never make it in time. Wear the Arab one, then. - It's easy enough to wear. - Doesn't it seem a little dull to you? Of course, but... okay, now we'll change the pack. You'll see, you'll feel like a new person And you really believe that? If only it was so easy! It's just that you need to relax, Mariagrazia. You need to learn not to think about anything. Not think about anything! Carla is in the garden with two men. Oh, really? She must have decided to invite a few friends over. Can you believe these girls of today? I tell you, when I was her age... - It's not too hot, is it? - No. Just look at Berardi... Well, I'm sure you know. Such an upstanding young man. And rich, too. Excuse me? Your coffee, Ma'am. Just a moment, Anna. Come back later on, in ten minutes. If we take them off now, it will ruin the whole effect. - Anna? - Yes, Ma'am? - Who is down in the garden with Miss Carla? There are two gentlemen that I don't know. They're in the lounge now. They have a special license, I don't know. They're noting down all the furniture. A linen chest, Renaissance period. A china cabinet in light mahogany. - Have you got that? - Yes. A small sofa with two cushions. Carla! What's going on here? - Good evening, Ma'am. - Good evening. Ma'am, we're here to take an inventory. - You know, it's for the foreclosure auction. - To take an inventory of what? We've been hired by the auction house. The mortgage hasn't been paid, you see. Can someone tell me what he's talking about? Who are you people? Why on earth are you here? And what are you doing in my house? They're bailiffs, Mother. They're here because of the mortgage. They told you. - Try to stay calm. - But it's unheard of! What gives you the right to just barge into people's homes... Hold on a moment, Mariagrazia... Do you have an official warrant? - Yes, of course. - Here you are. This means absolutely nothing to me! - But we must carry out or duty... - I think not! You won't do a thing! - Carla, call Michele for me. - He's gone out. - Where's he gone? - To the mortgage office... ... to figure out what's going on. - Excellent! Anyway, I'm calling Merumeci. You people, wait there. - Ma'am, it's useless, it's not something that... - I told you to wait! Even if your lawyer comes, it won't change anything. Mr. Merumeci is a friend of the family. And if you think... ... you can take advantage of a poor widow this way, then I'm calling the police! Mariagrazia, you're just making things worse! Don't you see that this must be some kind of terrible mistake? Just wait for Michele to arrive and everything will sort itself out. - In the meantime, we shall continue. - I said no! Listen, Ma'am, we don't have time to waste. We don't have to wait for anyone. When your son arrives, I will speak to him... ... and hopefully that will convince you. We shall return tomorrow. Oh, no! Right now you must show some respect and wait for me! Mother, please! I'll show you out. Thank you. The door was open. - Aren't you even going to say hello? - Hello, Leo. I opened it to let some air in. Mother always keeps the radiators so warm. It's suffocating in this house. It's good that you came. Hopefully you can calm her down. She's in quite a state. We're in trouble again. Some bailiffs came. You have beautiful legs, you know, Carla. You can imagine the kind of scene she made. She really screamed at those guys, and even threatened to call the police. You can't go on, can you? I don't know. I don't know, Leo. There are days that... When you can't go on, there's only one thing to do: change. Change? How? Yes, you change your life. You get away from here, start again. A girl like you can have everything she wants, don't you realize that? - Just as long as you want it, you know? - What's up with you today? Carla, why don't you come and stay with me? Stop it! Well? I'm serious, you know... With me you will have everything you could ever desire: clothes, cars... ... trips, you'll meet new people... Think about it, Carla. - I'm sure that... - You're sure? Carla, do you understand me? - I think I need a drink. - Oh, definitely. Merumeci! You're already here? - Mariagrazia. - I'm so grateful. - Really, it's nothing. - Lisa... - Hello. I arrived only a few moments ago. Just in time to catch up with Carla. - Our beautiful Carla. - Do you want some, Mariagrazia? Yes, but turn that lamp on. I can't see a thing over here. - You seem worried. - Absolutely! You don't know what happened! Two men turned up with such hateful faces... ... they wanted to make a list of the furniture... ... to make sure we hadn't sold anything! - Can you believe that? - Bailiffs, I imagine? - Sorry? - Bailiffs, Mother. I know, I know. That's what they said. Michele went to the office to find out what happened and I called you right away. You're the only one who can resolve this mess. That all depends what you mean by "resolve". - Good evening. - Michele! - Michele, did you make things clear to them? - No, I didn't. They made things clear to me. Well, go on. Not afraid, are you? Anyway, it's very simple. In fact, I don?t think it could be simpler. One more week. After which they will take away... ... the house, furniture, lamps... everything. They'll probably sell us at the auction as well. Leo, I'm sure there's something we can do. Listen, please don't get involved. Leo is here to help us, isn't that right? Ma'am, I've always done everything I could for your family, you know that. I've helped you out in many ways. But now, unfortunately, it's no longer possible. There's really nothing I can do. - You can either come up with the 800,000 lire... - Or the house becomes yours, doesn't it? Unfortunately, I can't wait any longer. I'm very sorry. Why are you sorry? You change, isn't that right? It's just another form of change... Carla, stop talking such nonsense! Very well, Merumeci, but please give us an extension. I'll get the money somehow. Of course! You can apply for a loan from a bank. Many of my friends have managed to... Lisa, excuse me, but as you know these are matters between myself and Merumeci. God knows, it doesn't matter to me. I would happily live in a single apartment... ... but Carla still has to find a husband, and you know what people are like. If they find out that there's been a foreclosure auction, it's goodbye marriage. Even if I give you an extension, things won't change. Mariagrazia, it's not easy to get a loan these days. We're in the middle of a crisis, all over Europe! Everyone is being very careful with their money. Anyway, I wouldn't worry about your daughter. Isn't that right, Carla? - She's young, beautiful... - Do you really believe that, Leo? For me, people around here are much more concerned with money, social standing... ... and appearances. You know how it is: no money, no friends. And we all know who will be the first to go... ... the first one out the door. Mr. Merumeci. Ma'am, I won't waste time responding to Michele because he's nothing more than a boy... ... but if, after everything that I've done up until today... Like the valuation of the house, for example. I'm talking about the mortgage. You somehow managed to set it up on a base of 800,000 lire... ... when you know, just as I do, that it's worth at least double that. Michele, you read too many books, you let your imagination get the better of you. No, it's the truth. This is why you've always advised Mother against selling the house. - Well, if that's how things are... - No, don't leave! - What do you expect me to do, stay here and be insulted?! - Michele was just saying that... I know exactly what he was saying! To say that I had the house valued... ... at half of what it should be, and that I'm now buying it for nothing... ... it's likes saying that I'm... - A thief? That's what you are. A real thief. Michele, I demand that you apologise to me, apologise immediately. - Michele! - Yes, Mother. Michele, apologise to him. Did you hear me? Right now, that's an order! - No, don't do it! - Leo! As you wish, Mother. What? Do you think me incapable of such a thing? Watch. Leo, I apologise to you from the bottom of my heart. And now, if I may... Well, goodbye. I'm going. Leo, are you coming? Merumeci is staying here, if you don't mind. Very well. Ah, you're here? I'm just on my way out. I'm going out too, but I just noticed that it's started to rain again... ... and I'm looking for some shoes that won't soak all the way through. I got you some of those cigarettes you like. You're an angel, but you really shouldn't have. My diplomatic friend! If you're going out, perhaps we can walk a little way together. I wanted to talk to you. To me? Of course... - Michele? - Should I wear my galoshes? Don't you care that I didn't want you to apologise to Leo? Of course I do! It's just that I already know why. No, actually, I only convinced myself of it this evening. Sometimes it's much worse... ... to avoid that kind of humiliation. - Humiliation? Are you sure? - Yes, darling. That's why I've decided to tell you everything. Oh, Lisa, listen... If it's something so terrible, why do you want to tell me? Why? Well, because I love you, and... Because I've known you forever, ever since you were a boy. I understand, Lisa. I understand and I'm listening. Michele, it concerns your mother. Your mother, you see, has made a grave mistake. - Just one? - She's made many... ... but just one which was this bad. - Well? - Listen... Anyway, 10 years ago your Mother met Leo Merumeci. Well, they started to see each other often and became very good friends. And... You're not telling me that Leo was one of my mother's lovers? Yes, and he still is. How frightening! I saw the light, can't you sleep? Your shoes are covered in mud. And hands stained with blood. I murdered Lisa on her front doorstep. Listen, about the house... When will we have to leave? I don't know. Soon. A few weeks at the most. - Are you sad? - No, only about the garden. More importantly, what book do you want me to give you tomorrow? Yes, tomorrow... Carla, why do you look so glum? So you agree with Lisa, then? She gave me an elementary lesson in life, this evening... ... in which you should be calm and happy. Oh yes, she seemed quite sure of it. - If only I'd been there. - What happened afterwards, then, this evening? These are dark times for Mother. She's knows that Leo is trying to get away from her. By the way, I almost forgot the best part. Do you know what Lisa told me? That Leo and Mother are lovers. - No! How did you react? - Dismay and amazement. Lisa is so weird... Is it possible that after all these years, she still thanks that we... No, Carla, she's not weird. She's just sensible. And my behaviour towards Leo, this evening... ... convinced her that I didn't know anything. For her, for everyone, maybe, it doesn't even seem possible... ... for a son to humiliate his mother's lover like that. - To throw his weight around in that way. - Michele... Yes, I know, it's useless to talk about it. Anyway, the house is gone. I have the impression that Leo isn't playing around this time. Besides, he always gets what he wants. Shall I turn off the light? - Good night. - Good night. Carla, to your new life. Ah, yes! A new life! I don't know why, but my heart is telling me... ... that this is the year that our Carla... - That I'll get married. And that next year I'll have a son. - And the year after that, a lover. - Carla! No, I hope that Carla, husband and sons apart... ... chooses a new life with emphasis on the long term, I'm sure that Carla understands me. - Isn't that right, Carla? - Of course she understands you... ... it's not difficult to understand after everything that happened last night. I know exactly what you're speaking about and I'm sure Carla knows as well. Terribly sorry, but would you mind explaining to me exactly what you mean by that? Do you really think that the whole world is blind? Blind and deaf?! Ma'am, if you were to speak a little more clearly... ... perhaps we would know what you mean. - It'll just bore you in any case... ... considering she's not even here! We all heard my... your dear friend Lisa... ... when she asked you to leave with her! Not that it's of any interest to me... ... but I hope, in the future, that you choose another place... ... to arrange your dates. And if you're so anxious to start a new life... ... no one is stopping you, you know? You're free to choose whoever you like... ... whenever you like and however you like! I just want to know one thing, Mother: If you realise what you're saying... ... if there's a reason for you to tolerate such things... ... and if you believe that things should carry on like this! It can't be any worse than this misery, every single day, always! Always the same thing! Do you think it's right? Don't you just feel wretched? So we've made it to this point, have we? I have to ask my own daughter's permission before opening my mouth! Carla has only skimmed the surface of the truth, Mother. To go deeper, one would need a million more words. And where would that get us? I had just hoped, at least on my birthday... ... that we could leave our quarrels aside... Come on, Carla, have some more. Very well, but only because it's your birthday. Thank you, Mother. - A little more. - That's it, Carla! That's the spirit! Come on, Mariagrazia! You as well! You should be happy! Champagne will make us happy! Let's make a toast, shall we! To the future husband of my almost-daughter! Carla! Darling, what's wrong? Do you not feel well? But darling, it's your birthday! And with all these wonderful presents you've received! If you're good, later we can go to the party at the Ritz! You'll be joining us, I hope, Merumeci... Come on, Carla, dry your eyes and smile. Carla? Be good, Carla. Don't cry. You remember, don't you? Big girls don't cry at the table. I'm sorry. I don't feel very well. Excuse me... Yes, Carla, go and get some air. - Yes, a bit of fresh air and it will pass. - Of course. Do you know, it was so odd to see her drink like that. So... - Why's that, Mother? - Well, I don't know... - It made me feel... - Old? Carla? - Yes, Leo? - What are you doing, sitting here? Come on, get up. Don't worry. Let's walk for a while. You're not ill, you just drank too quickly. Yes, it's true. I feel much better standing up. Oh, God! Why did you make me drink? Why did you drink? So that I wouldn't have to see anyone. Not Mother, not you, not Michele... No one! I don't want to see anyone! No one... Let's not talk such nonsense! You drank it because you wanted to. Do you think so? Perhaps I did. - Why did you call me that? - Call you what? - You called me "almost-daughter". - Ah, yes! Before, at the table... Did that surprise you? It was a joke, a game... From time to time adults play games too, you know? Just like you played games, too, right here, in this garden. You were a very beautiful girl, quiet... Sometimes I liked to imagine that I was your Father. You don't feel shame, do you Leo? - Who lives there? - No one. Carla? No, Leo, leave me alone! I feel ill! Leave me alone! Why do you drink, if you feel ill later? Very well... I guess it's my fault. I shouldn't have made you drink. Lesson learned. We should go, come on. In two hours I have to be back here to pick you up. And you need to recompose yourself, at the Ritz you have to be the most beautiful of all. Did you see that the Berardis are here, too. Well, why don't you go and say hello? - Good evening. - What can I get you? - A mint and cream. - A tea. - Michele, what would you like? - A Cognac. I don't understand why you have to discourage him like this. Mother, what do you know about Filippo Berardi? I know that he's intelligent, that he's frightfully rich... ... and that he's been trying to court you for a while, he's very stylish. - Mother, what do you know about his style? - Carla, that's enough now! Did you hear that? She wants to tell me how to behave! The world is upside down! Wouldn't it be better like that, anyway? - What's that? - The world being upside down. Think what it would be like: All the houses upside down... ... smoke that went down instead of up, and people walking on their hands... ... who say exactly what they think. - That's wonderful... ... though I don't think Merumeci agrees! - Quite the contrary, Ma'am. This time Michele is right. I'm not one for complaining, as he is, but I'll admit that... ... the world as it is now is at times terribly boring. One must find the courage to capsize the boat, to change things. What do you say, Carla? I say we should dance. If I may... You're on form this evening. Mariagrazia! Tomorrow you'll be at the ball, I imagine. - Yes, if you drop by and pick us up! - Of course, with pleasure. - Then I look forward to it. - Mother, shall we dance? Yes, darling. You're definitely the most beautiful. - Now, that wasn't so bad, was it? - What? Have you already forgotten about today? I haven't, I assure you. I can still see you on that bed... When will we be together again? No, Leo. It's useless. Not true. It will happen. And you know it. You must tell me when. When, Carla? No, Leo. Why don't we leave now? Drop everything and leave this place! Come on, Mother! It would be wonderful! Don't tell me it wouldn't! Don't squeeze me like that! It's been years since we've been to the cinema together, just the two of us. Don't squeeze, I said! Everyone is watching us! What a silly idea! And Leo? I suppose you're not thinking of him, are you? - Ah, it's you. - Hello, Lisa. Hello. I came to wish Carla a happy birthday... ... but there was nobody here, it was raining and so I decided to wait. You're soaked! Where have you been? - To the cemetery. - Where? I'm sorry I interrupted you. Why don't you carry on? Keep playing... What's the matter? Look what a state you're in. Do you want a drop of Cognac? - You'll catch a cold. - Don't you feel how hot it is in here? - With these radiators! - Well, you can't stay like this... ... with your hair soaking wet. If Mariagrazia could see what we're using her napkins for... Come on, put your head down. Outside in this weather, without a hat! Where have you been? Will you tell me that? A date? A girl? Michele, you can tell me everything. You know that, don't you? Yes. A girl, Lisa. Brown hair, young, very beautiful... I only met her recently, but it's like I've always known her. Like she was part of me. I love it. We never get tired of talking and looking in each other's eyes. Well, one day or another you'll tire of looking in each other's eyes, I'm sure of it. Of course, because you believe that everyone is the same around here... ... vulgar and hypocritical, false and corrupt like the rest of you! But that not the case, my darling Lisa. There's someone who's different than you! There has to be, understand?! Michele, why are you screaming like that? Why are you saying such absurd things? Someone different? Of course there is. You, for example, you're not like the others. I love you because you're frank, sincere and passionate. Me?! - Michele! - Oh, poor Lisa! I don't understand you. You don't know how much it hurts me to hear you speak to me in this way. Accusing me of hypocrisy, after what happened last night. I spoke to you with my heart open, so that I could tell you everything... ... to reveal the whole truth. - Last night? You told me the whole truth, last night? Yes, of course. Then I don't seem to remember hearing you mention, for example... ... that my mother took him away from you. - Who? - Leo. No, well, it's not as if she took him away from me, to be exact. She stole him from you, then... ... pinched, dragged him from your bed... Call it what you will, Lisa. The fact remains that he was your lover, wasn't he? Yes, but I was still very young, you see... ... Michele, it didn't mean anything to me. You know, it happened after my husband left... And it only lasted for about... Three years. It doesn't matter to me, Lisa. I only say it because you started talking about sincerity... ... about truth, etc. etc. - How funny! - What a wonderful afternoon! Yes, but there were too many people. There she goes again! That's what it should be like! The lights aren't working? As usual, all it takes is a bit of rain! Don't worry! This way it's more exciting, isn't it Merumeci? I drank too much! Is there anybody home? - If you're there, clap your hands! - I'm here! - Hi, Lisa. I came to give you your present. It's just a pair of gloves, Carla. They didn't cost much, but you always need gloves, don't you? - Thank you. - You really shouldn't have, Lisa. - Carla, go and get some candles. Ask the maid. - Yes, Mother. We had so much fun! But as usual Michele threw one of his tantrums. Leo even made me dance the Charleston! And it's quite easy! I learnt it straight way! Didn't I, Leo? You were wonderful! Where are the candles? I went to ask Anna. She's sleeping. Jesus Christ, of course she is! Bring the candlesticks. I always have to do everything around here. Lisa? Lisa! She's not bad, that Lisa, is she? She's has a good body, experience... But then why does she have such a big house if she's all alone? Excuse me. Carla, you shouldn't eavesdrop on adult conversations. - What's wrong? - Nothing. Come here. Hey, come here. What do you want? It's you that I want. And you won't make me wait. I want you now. Tonight. Tonight, at my house. I'll wait for you in the car and you will come down as soon as your mother is in bed. Leave me alone! No! Carla! Michele? - You see, I found them! - Mariagrazia! Hold on, Mariagrazia! I'll help you! Wouldn't it be better if we spread them out a bit? That's it, like this. - Yes, however you like... - Yes... there we go... Finally, the lights! Carla, why don't you play something nice for us? Funny, isn't it? As soon as the candles are ready... Classical music is so relaxing, isn't it? She was sitting here by chance, wasn't she? Absolutely. What a coincidence! If you want to leave, go. Nobody is forcing you to stay here. - I told you I'm fine. - You can take Lisa with you, too. What? What are you saying? I don't understand you. Oh, really? You won't be taking her home tonight, then? Yes, if she asks me to. It's not like I can refuse her. - And after you've taken her home? - I'll go to sleep. If you want me to, I'll stop, I can see that you need to talk. I've nothing against it, go right ahead. But it's silly that I play at the same time. Excuse us, Carla. Actually, we were just saying how wonderfully you play. That's not true. You were thinking about the music... ... just as much as I'm thinking about becoming a priest! You were speaking about your own personal affairs. Not at all! We were speaking about affairs, yes, but nothing too personal. I was just informing Leo that I plan to contact another agency... ... to deal with the foreclosure auction. - But... what do you mean? - Anyway, I'm going. Carla, please, calm down. I promise that we were listening to you. Please, sit down. And if I told you that you're a liar? You would be telling... the truth. That's enough, Michele! If you're looking for trouble, you'll find it! - Leo! - I'll find it? - From who? From you? - Yes, from me. - Michele! - Michele! Oh, my God! Where does it hurt? Here! We'll take you upstairs, Mariagrazia. Leo, help us! Leo! - Hold still. - Wait... There you go. Now you need a nice, long sleep. You can turn around now, Leo. I've had one of those injections, too. - If the doctor said that... - Lisa, please! - Leo? - What is it, Mariagrazia? If you only knew how mortified I feel... ... that my son would do something like that. Unfortunately he's a very strange boy. He's just not normal, sometimes. Isn't that right, Lisa? Yes, but don't work yourself up. You need to relax. Fortunately, Leo is someone who understands young people. And he understands Michele, just like he understands Carla. Yes, Leo has such a good heart. Thank heavens I got hit, and not him. By now it should have passed. Try not to worry about it anymore. Leo? Tomorrow I need to see you, urgently... We have lots of things to talk about, don't we, Leo? We also need to discuss business. Will you call me? Please! Okay, I'll call you. Look, it's still raining. I don't think it will ever stop. Good, well, I'm going now. Good night. - Good night. - Good night, see you tomorrow. Crisis averted, the patient will be fine. I left you a note. In your bag. For tonight. Lisa! What's wrong? Do you feel ill too? Me? No. - But I'm not in as good a mood as you. - I have my reasons. Bye, Carla. Goodbye. - Do you want me to drive you home? - No. I'll stay here a while longer. Just to make sure that Mariagrazia has fallen asleep. Very well. Bye. Carla! Listen, I wanted to tell you... What do you want to tell me? If there's anything I can do for you... I mean to say, if I can help you in any way... No. Michele! - Did it wake you up as well? - What is it? Down below. The usual window, Mother. - Then we should... - Should fix it, yes, for the new proprietor. Why is it that you always use that coat, when you have a perfectly nice dressing gown? What a winter this is! Did you hear that they had to give me an injection to calm me down? I'm sorry, Mother. Do you realise that you didn't waste one chance to upset me yesterday? - Really? - If only you could see... ... how awful you are to him! You've no idea how much affection, how much sympathy and love Leo has for you. Just the other day he said to me: "That boy is so closed off, so difficult... "... but I still love him a great deal, and will do everything I can to... ... help him establish himself in life!" You know, Michele, he can do a lot for you. Mother... Mother, listen... Why are you letting him take the house, then? Why don't you stop him? We could still do something. Of course, though it won't be necessary... ... Leo has already given us an extension. That's something, isn't it? - When? - Last night, in my room... ... when they gave me the injection. Tomorrow we'll put it all in writing. We've already set up an appointment. He wanted to tell you himself, but he couldn't find you. That's strange, I was just here in my room for the entire evening. Anyway, if that's how it is... He can be abrupt and harsh, just like all other businessmen... ... but Leo is the first person to understand how important this house is for us. For Carla, to give her a good marriage... ... for our social standing and also for the unity of our family. - What is there to laugh at? - Oh, I'm not laughing. I didn't say anything funny, did I? Anything funny? Just think, Mother... They've built an entire civilisation upon these words... Anyway, do you see where I'm coming from? There's just one thing... Back then, people weren't as stupid. This is your point of view! You really make me angry sometimes, Michele. I don't know if the youth of today are all like you. Always ready to criticise, always arguing about everything! "This is ridiculous, that's useless, this other thing isn't good enough!" What will you be left with? - What's wrong? - It's late. I'm going home. It's only half past 5. Are you ready? Yes. Why didn't you wake me before? - I don't know. I wanted to get dressed. - I see. Come here. - It's late, I have to go. - I'm getting up. No, I'll go by myself. It's better this way, seriously.. If you come by, perhaps I can see you. Anyway, it's morning already. There are taxis, just down the street. It'll only take me a moment. It's just that... I don't have money for a taxi. Could you lend me some? Sorry, I should have thought about that. Thank you. - Take this. - I'll start to earn my own money soon! Bye. - How did you get in? - Through the door, of course. I found it half-open. Oh, really? Okay, talk to me, I'm going out soon. I just came to inform you that they've cut off the telephones today. We agreed that we would call each other today, but... Do you ... need money? I didn't come for that Okay, I really have to be going. Here, here's your shirt. I have an important appointment at the Ministry. Well, if the Ministry is involved, it must be something important. Yes, it's about that demolition project. If I can get them to approve it, that will ensure all the contracts. But for now we're still all at sea. You'll get them to approve it, you always get what you want. Yes, that might be true. Listen, Leo, come here a moment. Just a moment. I have to go. Okay, then after lunch. You promised me last night. Yes, if I have time. We'll see. Yes, and I suppose you always find time for hussies, don't you? - What are you trying to say? - It's written all over your face! Take a look in the mirror, see what your eyes look like! - How can you lower yourself for that... - That, who? - Are you crazy? - No, darling. I know perfectly well what I'm saying. Listen, I said that we'll see each other after lunch. Now that's enough, okay? Are you coming to my place, or would you prefer it if I came here? I'll come and pick you up. Very well. Then I should leave, I have an appointment myself. Though Leo, if I were you I'd go easy on the alcohol. You're not 20 years old anymore, my darling. And neither is Lisa. Bye. Bye. - Oh, Mariagrazia, hello. - Sorry I'm late, Lisa. Oh, that doesn't matter, it's very nice here. - And anyway, I never get bored. - Really? Lucky you. I envy the people who never get bored. I'd like a tea, please. Finally, what a wonderful day! Such a bright, warm sun! Have you decided about this evening? What do you plan to wear? - A Spanish dress. - Oh, that sounds wonderful! And don't forget to do your face pack this afternoon. - It will do wonders for your stress. - Really? It will help my stress? You have a nerve, and make no mistake. Mariagrazia, would you mind telling me what's the matter with you? You don't know? I don't know why you didn't just say it to my face! Last night? Mariagrazia, what are you talking about? You know! I'm talking about you and someone else! He should be ashamed of himself! Oh, he should be ashamed of himself. Is that how it is? What are you afraid of? That I'll take him away? That I'll spoil him? Lisa, please, that's enough! No, it's not enough! I've seen you talk, judge, insult, and much more than that... ... and now you'll do me the favour of hearing how things are! No, Lisa. Please, stop it! I don't want to know anything! I don't want to hear anything! I have to tell you, because Michele is not a boy anymore, he's a man! You should know! Now what's the matter? - Michele? - Yes. You know how these things happen... I don't think you have anything to fear. The love that exists between Michele and I... Oh, Lisa! Lisa, Lisa! How stupid! My God! I thought that... You thought that it was Leo?! I should go, it's getting late. How much is it, please? - No, wait.... - No, Lisa, I'll pay. Lisa... You're right, you know. Life is so stressful at the moment. But I think I need something a little stronger than face packs! Mariagrazia, you'll manage. You're a strong woman. I admire you sometimes, I really do. There's nothing to admire, I assure you. You know, I'm very worried about Michele. He's so reserved, so alone... You'll see, everything will get better. There's a taxi! Do you want me to call it for you? You don't want me to walk you home? No, thank you. I'd prefer to take a walk by myself. Bye, darling. I bumped into them just here outside the front gate... ... and decided to tell them about the dance and the magnificent dress I'm wearing! Anyway, the classic Nouveau Riche... You should have seen their faces! They were green with envy! Perhaps they thought they were the only ones invited. Them and the King of Italy! A shame I wasn't there. You know, you have a nice colour today, Michele. Isn't that right, Carla? - You've been to tennis, haven't you? - Yes, Mother, all morning. Well done, Carla. After all, it's not good for us to mope around inside all day... ... because we're still very priveleged, and I think we need to realise this once again. I was speaking to Lisa earlier. We met up at the caf? this morning. Lisa is an extraordinary woman. She was telling me of the love she has for us, for you especially. Once might even say that she feels as though she's known you since you were born! Anna, bring the meat over. Michele, take some more. Don't worry, Anna! I'll go! That must be Merumeci. We'll need a lawyer today, I think. Either way, we need to get to the bottom of this. - Oh, Leo! - Good day. I was sure it was you. Let's go into the lounge. There's something I must tell you immediately! Very well. - Hi, Leo. - Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Let's not waste time, Merumeci. I need to ask you lots of things. With all these mortgages, the banks, the warnings... ... I tell you, I almost lose myself in it all, sometimes. Here, let's sit down. Leo, today I feel happy, like a child. I've thought such silly things! My God, how stupid! I thought that Lisa... Oh, Leo! I'm sorry. Just think, today we have an entire day to ourselves. Today? But you'll be innocent, won't you? Promise? We'll be innocent, like two good children. Just like it was in the beginning. You don't want coffee? - Darling, what's the matter? - I just asked if you wanted coffee. No. I'll get some while I'm out with Merumeci. We're going out right away. We have lots to do, you see... - We have nothing to do. - I'll go and get ready. I like your house, you know. I really do. It's been a long time since I've been here. Not since I was a child, I don't think. You should see Mother now. She's transformed, happy... And she finally praised you, officially. Who knows what's wrong with her now. Well, what are you doing? Aren't you getting undressed? Carla was in some kind of hurry this morning, too. She wanted to play tennis, go skiing, wanted to move the furniture around in my room. It must be the sun... Perhaps it's gotten to me too. I'm here with you, aren't I? Listen... Wait... I knew it... You look much better without clothes, than you do with them on. Listen, darling... I don't know, you're making me feel uncomfortable. - No... - Yes. - Why? What is it? - You're strange. Strange? Is it really so strange that a man and a woman... ... alone, wish to make love peacefully... ... as a subtle light filters through the window? Oh dear, would you look at that! It's started raining again. Excuse me. Anyway, it's better this way, isn't it? It's so much nicer with the rain. I remember, one time... - I was with a girl... - Michele? - Yes? - Not like this. What do you mean? I want it to be different, for us. - Different? - Yes. This way we'll spoil everything. Very well. Then tell me, tell me exactly how you want it to be. Michele, between us there should be a kind of understanding... ... something more. A profound understanding, even. Pure in nature. - Yes, Michele. To talk, talk and... - And look into each other's eyes. But we'll become tired of that, you said so just yesterday afternoon. And the other day, Lisa, did you tell me about Leo and Mother for my own good? Are you sure you weren't just preparing for this? To have me here... ... in your bed? Now you say that it's not working, but only because you wanted... ... a nice reason, to disguise yourself. To lie to yourself and others. To cover you fear. This is the problem. You cover yourself so that you don't see and don't feel... ... as long as you don't see and don't feel. You don't feel anything anymore. Don't worry, Lisa, it's me I'm talking about. Michele, it's not true. I know what you're trying to say... ... but when I told you about your mother and Leo... ... it hurt you, I could see it. - Oh, Lisa... I've known about that for 10 years. Carla and I used to tell each other news every night, before we went to sleep. Michele... Then I'm sure you know about Carla, too. What do you mean? I don't understand. Carla is Leo's lover. - Whose? - Leo's. Leo Merumeci. God, are you joking? - How do you know? - I saw them. I saw them kissing each other last night, when the lights went off. - Michele, don't you believe me? - Yes... Yes. - Of course I believe you. - Don't you feel anything? - Does your sister not matter to you? - What?! My sister? It doesn't matter to me that she's been seduced by that...? I won't let him get away with it! I'll make him pay! - Why? - Why?! Because there's a limit to everything, in this world! Because he doesn't even love her! Understand? At least love! If at least he loved her... No, it's just the same. He'll always be a scoundrel. A filthy and dirty scoundrel! I'll put an end to that thief! - You can be sure he'll pay! - How? You don't believe me, do you? What do you want? - I want to speak with you. - Now?! I was sleeping! Another time, Michele. This evening, if you like. No, now. Are you crazy? Now, get out of here. - Just know that this isn't over. - Where's Carla? How should I know? She might be at home, she might be out... it's her business! Don't worry, Leo. I'm coming, Michele. Or you could just come down... why not! This way all of us are together. Yes, take your brother home, the intellectual who shoots guns at people. Michele, listen, I... You don't have to explain anything to me, Carla. What could you even tell me? That you don't love him? Well, I don't hate him. And yet you've given yourself to him and now I want to kill him. But why? What's happening to us, Michele? Nothing, Carla. That's the point. Nothing is happening to us. Either that, or too much is happening to us and we've just learnt to ignore it. It's the same thing. The same way... A round of applause for the poet! Now for something even more abstruse... Learn this: Every one of us has very concrete motives and.... ... reasons for everything we do! Even to steal, of course. Even to sleep with your "almost-daughters"!? But you will never understand what it is to desperately want to do something. Not even to want to do something, but to actually get up and do it. - So now you feel better? - No. You know, I didn't even manage to fire the gun. Come on then, shoot me! If you want, I'll even load it for you, then we'll see if you have the guts! - The guts? - It doesn't matter, Michele. Either way, afterwards it'll still be the same, at least for me. You'll realise straight away that it hasn't changed anything. - Only a stronger feeling of disgust. - Now that's enough! I have things to do! - I don't have time for this chit-chat. - Okay. Let's go, Carla. Come away with me! We'll change everything and everyone! A change of air! We'll sell the house! - The house is mine, don't forget. - We still have 5 days! Carla, if we're together, if you have faith, there's always a way! Let's give it a go! Yes! I'll find someone to buy the house... ... to clear the mortgage and pay Leo! Someone who'll buy it, you know? Not someone who'll steal it! In 5 days you won't be selling anything, just moving out. Always at a greater price than yours! You know very well, Leo. You know that all it takes is for us to move, and that this time you can't count on Mother. - Carla, listen... - And after that? What will we do after that? We'll start again! Even in two rooms! In one! From the start, Carla! A new life! - I'll find a job! - Where? In the arms of Lisa, perhaps. Come on, Carla. Go and get dressed. Just know something: If you want, I'll marry you. That's right, marry you. - Why? - We've made a mistake, haven't we? I mean to put it right, so think about it. Go! Go, Carla! Go! Carla, don't you see? It's simply ridiculous! There's no motive, there's not one reason for doing it! Many reasons. And what would they be? Firstly, you're both ruined, whether or not you manage to sell the house. And no one will marry you with the mess your family is in... ... and with me living in the house. Thirdly, I have money so you'll have the life you want. Fourthly, I don't love you, therefore there will be no jealousy, drama, complications. It's better for you, and better for me to have a young wife from a good family. The fifth, and last reason, is that you've already slept with me. With disgust. Michele, I'll finish getting dressed. I'll be down in a moment. Carla, you don't want to marry him, do you?! It's absurd! Your "new life", Michele... ... isn't that absurd? And do you really think that you and I... ... would ever have the strength to face it? When will you tell Mother? Tomorrow. Kids, you're finally here! What happened to you? The Berardis are already here, and you still need to get dressed! Anna, remember to ask if they would like a drink. And on top of that Lisa showed up. The poor thing, so kind... ... she helped me get dressed, but she can't come with us. Carla, you've no idea how bad I feel. No make-up, not even a dress... And I'm so stressed out! It had to be tonight! Merumeci will be here before long, you know? Don't worry, I'll see to it. Michele? What happened? Did you see him? No, Lisa. - Are you busy this evening? - No. Are you not going to the party? I don't want to. If you like, we can have dinner together. Then perhaps I can stay at your place. Of course. Certainly...
