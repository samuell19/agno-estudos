How much? Keep the coin inside. Why do you keep eating? What will people think of you? They won't buy. Eat this dear. How much did we make Mother? About 25 rupees. Only 25 rupees? I want to see the concert. You sit here alone okay. I'm bored. Just stay for a while. No, please! Dhunu, Dhunu Come to harvest betel nut. Here... throw it to me! Where have you run off to? Huh? Your sister is doing your job! Go away. Will you? Coming again! Going or not? Damn. Here is the showoff. Hit him. Bogi, these stories are interesting. Can I please borrow this comic book? Okay but return it soon. Return it to me soon, I need to read it too. Okay, let me see this one. (Reciting Assamese alphabet) What are you reading? You shouldn't read comics in the classroom. Bolo,stop shining the light on my face. This is turning out really good. Stop disturbing us! Go! Go and sit there. Oi! You have come to watch, so just keep quiet. I am being polite. It will look beautiful when I make it. Shut your mouth. Go away! No need to come and show off! Go..Go from here! The showoff again. Look at him. Catch him! How dare he slap Dhunu! Catch him! Catch him! I can't run anymore. He's gone. Don't cry sister. We will find a way to punish him. Here, take your books. Let's go. We are late. Don't cry. We will beat him up if we see him. Stop it, that's enough. Wait. You keep playing with those boys. Huh. You even go to school with the boys. Why don't you go with the girls? Huh. Munu! Enjoying your grass my dear? Let's go. Drink some water. Hold on my dear! I am getting you some fresh leaves. You didn't do a good job. You should have thrown the cycle into the water! You were not there. The police would have caught us not you. No need to go if you are so scared. She's your sister. If it was my sister I would have gone. My father would have kicked me out of the house! It's not so easy! What kind of father will kick out his own son! What will you know? Bhebelu is scared for nothing. Do you remember how you slapped me that day? Do you think I have forgotten it? My cheeks had turned red. Couldn't sleep in the night. Even my Mother and Brother don't beat me like that. Isn't that right brother? Right. You have to ask for apology to be a part of our Rockstar band. isn't it brother? Yes. Do you agree Bolo? Yes, yes. Will you ask for an apology or not? Sorry! You will also have to let us ride your cycle. Wait! Wait! Go... Go... Go... Let's go! Hey Bolo! Have you finished reading the story book? No. The girl's been asking for it back. I need to return it. Give me the utensils. I have got something interesting today. I will show it to you. What is it? Wait, let me show you. Look there are so many small kids with a rock band! Oh! Nice! Yep. That's nice! Look! They got an award at the end. Wow! It's a gold prize! Let's also form a band like this. A band costs a lot of money. How much will a real guitar cost? Will it be around five hundred rupees? Huh? Who will give you a guitar for five hundred rupees? There are no fish. Damn it! Did you catch anything? Nope. Brother! I almost got one. Where? One large prawn. You are just making things up! Why would I lie? You can come see. Dhunu careful! You will fall down. Come back! Pull! I've got you! I won't let you go... Pull it out, pull it out... Why do you keep blabbering? We should not let him fish with us! He keeps talking like a mad man! Oh God! My rod broke. So your rod broke. Ha ha! Look, I caught a big one! Let's go, I have had enough! Hundred and fifty rupees. One fifty rupees? For this little one? It's so small. Two fingers long. Oi, leave the guiar alone. It belongs to someone else. Who would have thought one guitar's worth five or six thousand? Oh my God! They are so expensive. We will only be rockstars in our dreams. We can't even get it here. We'll have to go to the city. The guitar itself is so expensive. We also need drumset, casio, and pads. Your Father has money. He can help us! No, he won't. He doesn't like music. Munu... it's beginning to rain. Let's go home. Dhunu! Dhunu! Where did these two go! Where did you run off to? The firewood's wet. The cloths are wet. Huh! To get Munu. You have no responsibilities towards anything in the house. Where is your brother? Huh? Look at her. She is so spoiled. I have not seen a girl like her. Come here girl. Why are you climbing the trees with those boys? You will become a woman soon. Why do you need to climb trees? Society will segregate you if you roam around with boys. Can't you find any girls to play with? Why always need to play with boys? Your mother doesn't say anything? If you were my daughter I would punish you. They want to punish my daughter climbing a tree! I do everything myself. Is anyone there to share my burden? How have they ganged up on my daughter! What happened? Look here. They are punishing my daughter for climbing a tree! They scolded her. I am suffering after her father's death. I have to do everything myself. I am in trouble. That's why I am letting my girl to do everything. Have I bothered anyone so these people are harassing my daughter? After my husband's death I do everything myself. Who can stop people from talking. People take chances when there is no man in the house. Oi. Keep it there. Is this enough? Take more! Is this much enough? Keep swimming. Go on... Keep swimming. How did you learn to swim? We were fishing on the other bank. I couldn't swim yet I didn't know what to do. My friends encouraged me to swim back and kept telling me I could do it. So I swam but then they were far away. I swam and swam... three times I sank before reaching the bank. That's how I learnt. You learnt just like that? You can also swim if you show courage. Why Father could not swim? He never stopped being afraid. That is why he drowned in the flood. Take the goat to graze on that side. There is grass there. Not now... it's going to rain. No, it won't! Mother! Do we have money in the bank? Mother... do we have money? Mother! No. Mother... can you buy me a real guitar? Mother... will you buy one for me? Will you mother? Okay, we will sell the goat and buy it. Why will we sell Munu? How much are you selling it for? Not much. I also buy from others. Mostly five rupees! We only repair guitars. We don't sell them. Oi Sister... Sister! Come back. Someone left this for repairs six months back. If he doesn't come back soon I might sell this. How much does it cost? I can give you a discount. How many times have you failed in the same class? Three times. And you are still loafing around after three times. Huh! You roam around but you don't study! Heh! Show me your hand! Why do you keep your hair so long? Will you cut your hair tomorrow or not? If you don't I will teach you a lesson. Oi! What do you want? Owl! Owl! Owl! Owl! Owl! Owl! Will you say it again? Owl! Enough now... let's go. There is no curry? O Brother! O Manabendra! O Brother! Manabendra oi! Brother o! Manabendra oi! Brother o! There he is! Dharma, the creator told Prince Yudhishthira. I will ask five questions. If you answer them properly you can have water. And you will be able to save one of your five brothers. Only one? Yes, only one. After that, the creator asked who is bigger than the world? Yudhishthira said, Father or Dad. Father! After that, he asked who is larger than the sky? Yudhishthira said Mother. Mother! Then he asked, what is the fastest thing in the world? Yudhishthira said mind. There is nothing faster than the mind. How? If you think you are here and then you imagine yourself at the school, you are immediately there. Actually you are not at school, you are asleep on your bed. That is how your mind works. Without taking a step you are there. That is mind. Dharma then asked who is the richest? Yudhishthira said the one who is not greedy. The one who has no greed. Whose only desire is to serve God. He is the richest. Baby... my little baby. O Munu... Stop it... Mother tell me 'Who is the richest'? Who? The one who has no greed. And who lives to serve God is the richest. Who gave you this idea? Grandfather from up north told me. And, what is larger than the sky? You, only you... Mother. Whatever is in our thoughts, we can materialize it into reality. All thoughts turn into things eventually. Your negative thoughts will create negative actions. If you focus on positive thoughts... - Did the kids go to school? - Dhunu has. But I am worried about my son. Ever since the teacher beat him, he has avoided going to school. I don't know what to do! Where is my share? Leave it, I don't want to eat it. If this embankment was there that time, I would have my father today! Bolo. Hmm. If I tell you something can you promise me not to tell anyone? Hmm. I will have a real guitar soon. How? I will have it, I know. Actually, I have read, if you want something you will get it. I have kept the paper. I will give it to you too. Hmm. If I tell the others, will they laugh at me? I don't know, they might laugh. I will have my own guitar. Looks like it will rain. It won't rain. Sunshine is behind us. Manabendra loves one of them. Bye dear girls. See you tomorrow. Such a brat! The girls look good in pink dresses. I will tell your parents. They will punish you! And Brother, Mother will teach you a lesson. I will beat you if you do! You dare beat me? Come on! Beat me! Dhunu is a good girl. She won't say anything. Manabendra is in love with one of the girls. Wait until we get home. I'll teach you a lesson! The others don't have any interest for a rock band. The are just interested in girls. My brother is the biggest culprit. This road is bad. Get on to the other side. I will manage. You don't have to get down. Grandpa if I want something, will I actually get it? If your will power is strong and you're determined to achieve it. If you keep working towards it.. Then you will get it. Why won't you? But what do you want? A guitar. Guitar! Oh my God! Guitars are very expensive! Although, you might be able to make do with a cheap one as you will be learning! Remember I told you, you should study hard and get a scholarship. The scholarship will get you money. Then you could also sell goat milk. You can sell vegetables from your garden. Hide all your money in a bamboo trunk. Come dear! Help me collect the betel nuts. Climb down... carefully. Aunty, let me know when you need me again to harvest betel nut. Ok dear. Twenty rupees. Thirty rupees. Thirty five. The big one is mine! The big one is mine! I'm wet! I'm wet! Oi! Do you think it will flood? The floods are already here! Everything is getting submerged. Look we used to climb that tree! It's under water now. What will happen now? This road will be submerged soon. Surely it will. Look the water level! We need to ban the flood! Yes we will! Yes we will! We need to ban the rain! Ban the rain! Ban the rain! We need to ban the flood! Yes! Ban the flood! Ban the flood! We need to ban the rain! Ban the rain! Ban the rain! Our demand must be fulfilled! Must be fulfilled! Must be fulfilled! Our demand must be fulfilled! Must be fulfilled! Must be fulfilled! Mother, are we going to have a flood? Yes. - The flood has already taken the bridge. - I know. How will we go to school? - You will have to take the long way around. - That will be very far! But you have to go to school. Brother will use that as an excuse not to go to school. Dhunu! Why are you in the water? Hold on... I am just checking the water level. Bolo, get the goats. I am bringing them. Give me the box. Careful you'll drop it. Come... come out of there Let's go my dear. Come... come out here. - Bolo, can you manage by yourself? - I think so. Wait, let me help you. Come... come dear. Slowly... the goat will jump off. Hold on. Don't be worried! The boat is sinking. Don't worry. Scoop the water out from the boat. Row slowly. The farm's completely destroyed. We lose our farm in the flood every year. Why do you still farm? It happened last time too. Work is religion for us. Hard work is the only thing we have. The floods have taken the bridge with it. The flow is too much. We can not go ahead. Let's not try, it's dangerous. I can see a pillar there. I can see one more pillar! The water will take at least 3-4 more days to recede. If the embankment breaks our house will be completely flooded. Cut these ones. Cut them at the bottom Dhunu. But I can't reach the roots! Let me cut them on the sides. Oi... bring the boat here! Wait! We are on our way! Hurry. Stack this with the rest. I could have brought my hat. Yes, you should have. It's cold. They didn't tie the ropes properly. That is why. They didn't do a good job. People are useless! Come... leave your slippers there. Leave your slippers. Careful... or you will fall. Go. Come around. Wait... you'll fall if you come that way! Step on the raft first. Are you hurt? No, but I'm all wet. What a fall! Stop playing Bhaskar. If you fall your mother will beat me. She won't. Just watch out! - Pass it to me. - You don't know how. I can manage. You don't need to. Please. Do you know how deep the water is if you fall in? You won't be able to do this. Do you know who lived here? No idea. A tribal family, Rabha. They were new here. Have you seen the embankment on the other side? No, I haven't. The embankment was not there when I was small. This whole place used to be like a sea during the flood. My father died because the embankment was not there at that time. How old were you? I was... I remember that. Did it flood where you were living before? No. If the embankment breaks will there be more water here? Yes if it breaks there will be more water everywhere. Everything will drown. Why did you take Bhaskar with you? Huh? Do you even know how to row? Do you? Do you know how to row when it's flooded? Why did you take someone else's child? His mother was worried sick. One has died already. Do you also want to die? Huh? Mother, will the crops survive? No, it won't. Mother, are you not sleepy? No. Go to sleep. I will sleep soon. Dhunu, what are you doing? Why making noise Dhunu? Dhunu, what are you up to? Ten. Thirty. Fourty. Fifty. Sixty. Seventy... Eighty... Ninety. Maa, please close your eyes. Why? Just close them. - First tell me why. - Please close, Maa. Show me your hands. Show me fast. Where did you get so much money? By harvesting the betel nuts. Who told you to do that? Am I not feeding you? Don't go work for other people. Okay dear? Where is my goat! Brother! Have you seen my goat? I looked everywhere, but couldn't find her. Munu! Munu! Come here! Munu! - You are good for nothing. - Come this way. Munu! Where are you? Munu! Where are you? Munu! Come my dear! Rascal fox! Look over there. Munu my dear. - I think a jakal might have eaten her. - Let's go to the other side. Come here... please. We're running out of oil. Munu my dear. No oil for fire. Munu. Munu! Come here. Munu. Oi Basanti! Your girl got puberty. Your girl got puberty. What happened to Dhunu? You boys go away! You are not allowed to watch! Come my dear! She can't see a boy and is not allowed to eat rice. Only fruits. Keep her separately. Oh God! Why are you making me wear this? Now what next? Sprinkle the water. Okay what now? That's it... don't climb trees anymore, okay? Be good... don't run around with boys. That's it. Stand up. What now? Bring everything with you. Let's go inside dear. Break the lamp with your leg. Sprinkle the water on her. Done? Let's go. Bring Dhunu out... quick. Let's start the prayer, Sister. Hurry up! Okay, let's start. KRISHNA O HARI O RAAM KRISHNA I have ten rupees for you. Only ten. We haven't got anything for you. What did you have to bring. Your earrings look real good. Is it gold? No. I got it for ten rupees. It looks like real gold. Wear it for the festival. And this dress too. - Have you eaten? - Not yet. Please eat. Don't leaving without eating. Hey Dhunu, I've come for your celebrations. You have betel. Give me one. I don't have a gift for you. You are looking very pretty today. You are pretty but you are looking even more beautiful today. Is that so? Did you eat? Yes. The food was real tasty. Hey Bolo! Did you eat? Stay here. Okay. Help me with the guests. Stay till evening. Don't go anywhere. I will be right here. Dhunu is loooking real pretty today. How many times will you say that? Sure. Did you catch anything Grandpa? Yes, dear. The water is quite deep here. Yes, you're right. Tree nymph! Get down! You will be possessed by ghosts. Go... Go. Where are you going? Get back here. Careful Dhunu. Watch your step. Look at her. Wash it properly. Give me that. Stop being such a brat. You have learnt well. You are doing good.
