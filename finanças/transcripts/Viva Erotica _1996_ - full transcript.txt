Fuck Me Come on Fuck me Cut Cut now? No way, l can't! l can't stop now! No way! Why'd you ask me not to 'Cough'? l didn't cough at all. No What was it then? Get in then? What is it? Why are you peeping at me? Crazy! There's nothing l've not seen before. Silly. Not you. l meant the "duck". "Why are you peeping?" "No." Yeah, it's cute. Only now you notice it? lt's been there a long time. Towel. You won't notice me even if l were to grow a beard. Like a dummy. You're just unemployed, it's not the end of the world. l can work and pay for your living first. But you've to pay back, you know? l haven't worked for a year. Not quite, well just about, l guess. l know someone's gonna call and offer you a job. Silly girl l'm not. Come and pretend you're "duck". OK... Phone is ringing. Yes, speaking. -l'm Chung? -Chung. What's up? No...what? Yes. What's it...yes. About the script that you mentioned to me. l've found an investor. He likes it. Come and let's have a talk. Did you hear what he said? Shit, the amount is not right. Don't fuck with me. Pay up quick. What do you want me to do? How many buses and tools would we need for this fight? Food and drinks cost money too, you know? Fuck you. You're talking about "face"? Because of your face. All you care about is your face, isn't it? Are you crazy? l'm doing a legitimate business now. You think l'm still into dirty dealings? Go to ask the accounts department. lf it can be profitable, come to me. Now get out. Sorry... What were we discussing? Yes. Oh yes, the story begins with... The man arrives MTR and notices that someone is following him. Keep tailing him. He quickly enters the MTR passage. Boss, you've been in MTR, you know there're many passages in the station. The camera will follow him running, then... lt'll be a visual effect of movement. Sorry. Damn need you ask? Just burn the shop down. What's the matter with the Hong Kong Government? My movie is showing tonight. The VCD is already out on the streets. lt's gonna affect my box office. Yes. So burn that fucking shop! We're going too far. Right, what were we talking about?... MTR? Yes, the actor finally faces the killer in the MTR. Killer, yes... the killer. By the way, have you seen the movie? "Seven", "Seven Deadly Sins". l saw it, a low budget film. We can sell our movie as a comedy. What shall we name it? "Double Seven". "Dork and Dorker" Not bad... "Dork and Dorker" We also add in some eroticism and violence. With a HK$2.5million budget we'll profit for sure. Specially from the overseas market. Great. Who's the leading lady? Damn, what's up again? Mango? lt's Mango. Ask her in. Sugar Daddy, you lied. You said l got the leading role. But the Director gave me only the supporting role and in the nude too. lf it was the leading role, l won't mind doing the classy sexy scenes but... Okay... Do what you want. l'm discussing a new project, let me introduce you. This is Hong Kong's famous Producer and Director. How do you do, director and producer. Miss Mango, fine. ls she okay? Fine, fine. Why are you in such a hurry? What's wrong with you? Anyone killed your father or raped your mother? Well? No. Why are you behaving so badly? Did you hear what he said just now? What? Didn't you hear him? You said he liked my script, that's why l met him. Now, he's only interested in making an erotic film. What..."Seven". A comical erotic film. What movie? He's only interested in the money. He's the boss, he has to be calculative. Nothing wrong with X-rated movies, a lot of people are doing it. Your last 2 films flopped. lf you fail again, you're finished. Have you paid your rent and the water bills? Given your mother allowance yet? Have you? Movies are illusions. lf you're on top, you can do anything you want. This is the rule of the game. You've been in this line for over 1 0 years. Other than making movies, what else can you do? Your girlfriend, you can't live off of her or you want her to support your living? -Here take this. -What's this for? What is it for, take it. Seriously give it a thought and call me tonight. Other than making movies, what can you do? You again? Yes, what coincidence. l'm delivering documents. Delivering document? A new job again? Yes, l'm the office assistant in a trading firm now. What about you? Got a job yet? No, l've been making movies over 1 0 years. l've never tried other work. Can l still change line? Why not? You're a multi-talented filmmaker. You People know kidnapping, fighting, negotiating. Boast with the best of them. So why not? The Employment Restructuring Plan Division. They help the unemployed of all ages. They got me my job, lt's pretty good. Better go and register now. Brother, some orange? Did you see me? What did you say? Lower your voice. Mom, l'll give your allowance later, OK? What if l was to sell the flat? Why sell it? Our neighbour Mrs. Poon sold hers for nearly HK$2 million. l want to sell it and rent a cheaper one. Then invest the money in shares. Mom, please don't. What if you lose? What if the price drops? l've to support your brother and sister, you've your own family. Can't depend on you forever. lt's not that l'm unemployed. Really, you've got a job? What is it? With the Radio & Television Hong Kong. When's your program airing? Soon. lt's a sex educational program. That's good. Are you free to see a new flat? l said don't sell the flat. So why see a new one? l meant the house l'm going to live in when l die. Your father's alone at the Cape Collinson cemetery for years. l want to accompany him... Say no more, my dear long-lived Mom. -What? -Bye bye. Always running away. Have some dessert first. l watched Loong's movies. Do you know him? l told him that it would collect HK$1 0 million box-office. and put more feelings for his next movie. And not to shoot the shit stuff again. You're so direct. What was his reaction? Like you, he stared at me fiercely. He said he has given the picture his all. l saw it too, it's not bad. There are some good scenes in it. Really? You must be out of touch. Your standard is falling. Not buying. No. We're no jobs, do you understand? We're unemployed. Unemployed! Not buying... Go away... Quick. Don't want to talk about it. Don't push me. Lower your voice. No job, buddy? Do you know lshikawa Jirou? The Director of the cheap sex film "Bloody Killer"? l know him. But l can't tell you. Damn, don't be like that. ls it Herman? No. No? l know all your friends. lt has to be Herman, right? l said no. Don't bullshit. He's got a wife and kid. So tense. lt must be Herman, tell me. Do you know Producer Chung? That immoral guy. He called today, said he's shooting a porn film. And asked if l want to work with him. X-rated? Will you work with him? No way! Such films have bad influence on children. The money's good but you'll be looked down upon. Yes, you'll have bad luck for 3 years. Then multiple of another 3 years. How many years exactly? Many, many years. As many as you live. Don't just sit and talk. Until then, no change. Sing. There she is. Sis-in-law. -Madam -Madam You're off? Not out catching whores? Don't need to. All you preverts are here. You're so humorous. How is the movie going? -What?... -What movie? Tell us about your project. Yes, you must hire us. What do you mean no? Aren't we buddies? lt's nothing. Just bullshit. What is that bullshit? Tell me. l'll even do X-rated films. What did you say? Do you like plastic watches? lt's alike those expensive watches. But it's very cheap, only $1 00 each. Want one? You sell watches too? He wants me to make an X-rated movie. He wants me to do an X-rated film. lt's okay. Ah Chung asked you to do it? You're filmmaker? l was a filmmaker too. But didn't work out successfully. There's nothing wrong making porno films. "Seven Sex Maniacs" starring big tits many years ago. lt made the men nosebleed seeing it. Yes. Do it? You don't mind? Don't be silly. You just do a good job of it. Right, make it more entertainment and classy. How about buying one watch to celebrate? Ok, l'll take this one. Call me when you need an extra role. l won't mind. lt's a deal. Go! Go! Hey, that's fast enough. Don't listen to her, she's crazy. OK, ready. Light on his face here. Ready, action. Cut. You've to hit him real. Don't try to resist. One more time, OK? Ready, action. Cut! Sorry, sir. We're making experimental film, you're in our camera. lt's OK. You're still using films while all are video taping. Are you writing a script? Yes. Sorry to bother you, take your time. Good. Thanks. "A great achievement is" "a man makes his opportunity" "as often as work it out." "Hold fast to a dream." "l've left home on a summer day." "A heavy rain pours on my face." "Then, l find my way." "The end." "Viva Erotica." How is it? lt's good. Really? But... Why the villain has been shot in the public no one calls the police? l'm a cop, l must know it better. Also, the old man, why has him impotent? lf he's not impotent, he may not get the sex maniac audience's appeal. The woman too, why that stranger rapes her and she's having orgasm. But she's a whore, no way. She's already got paid, why she still sits on the bed? Do l know what this story is all about? Why make films? Why need a camera? Why call 'camera', 'action' and 'cut'... Help, don't kill me. Don't rape me. Let go of the cloth. Help, don't kill me. Hands up. Please raise your hands. Help, don't kill me. Don't rape me. -Put up both your hands. -Don't rape me, help! Cut. Can you please put your hands up. Why? No one raises their hands like this. l don't think so. Why not? At gunpoint, wouldn't you put up your hands? lf you do, the cloth will fall and expose you more. So, you'll get a chance to fight back. l won't. l'll hide at a corner which is less revealing. lf he comes this side, l'll run this way. lf he comes up again, l'll move to this corner. Or else l can hide to be the bear here. You see! l should've run earlier. Why did l stay on? l can escape using the ladder. Director, let's skip the scene. Let's do Chiu's scene first. Miss Mango, you've shot many scenes, why don't you take a break first. l'll buy some pears for you, OK? Fine, make sure it's juicy. OK... l'm allergic to other fruits. Bitch! Dicky, are you alright? Sorry. There's a change. When Chiu points at Mango, use the hand-held camera. Hand-held camera again? Please don't, you know. People in the underdeveloped countries, when seeing unsteady hand-held shots will think there's a problem with the camera. But it's more motional with a hand-held camera. What motion? Every shot is hand-held. Can't you get motion without a hand-held camera? Editing can help. lf you like it so much, you do it. Director, tomorrow l'm busy. A size 36, E cup. ls the hand-held hing ready? Serves you right. Lights. Come, come over. Closer Lights here, not on me. Where's Sunny? l'll look for him. Come... Chiu? We don't need to rehearse. When you reach the 'T' mark, take off your clothes. Then point the gun to the left of the camera. Say "hands up, quiet". Get it? Right side, left side... Watch out the bullets. Does he know what he's doing. l guess so. Let's try it again. Ready Dicky? Roll it, speed. Action. Don't move, quiet. Shut up. Quiet What the hell are you doing? Something wrong with the cover up? Cover up, what's this? Are we shooting "Dumbo"? Chiu, please go to the restroom first. Sorry. lt's not funny, let try something else. Try and take it out. lt's easy. Relax or else l can't pull it out. Try it. Not too hard please. Relax a bit more. -Try harder. -Relax. ls it my turn yet? You fool me. Who's fooling you again? Kui, Come with me. l won't listen to you anymore. Miss Mango... Wah touched my hand on purpose. Be careful when you do a scene with this sex maniac. Really? He was a rich man but lost everything to gambling and women. Even now he's playing an impotent sex maniac. He's well dressed, but don't let that fool you. Director, if you're not shooting me, l'll leave. l don't have much time. Alright. l'll do. But we've to adjust the lighting first. How long do l have to wait? A little while Miss Mango. Your turn soon. Sugar-Daddy. -Director. -Boss. ls the shooting on schedule? Yes. l don't want to wait a whole day for a short scene. You said there's no nude scenes but now they've. l won't do it. Fine... Just do what you want. l bought you some fruits, go have some. Take a break and have some food. Sing, please take her shots first. l know but she refuses to do anything. So what can l do? OK, l understand. l'll talk to her l settle it, l'm going. l'm leaving. After the shooting, let's have some Japanese food later. Be a good girl. Thank you for your hard work. Director, keep up the good work. Listen, it'll be better to have her in the nude, more. Let's go. l'm leaving now. Start to work. ls it my turn now? Make it quick. You know, l have a date. Don't think l like doing porn, l've a date too. Ready. Roll it. Speed. Action Help, don't kill me. Help, don't rape me. Help, don't kill me, don't rape me... Cut. OK, Next. There's too much movement, everything's blurred. You can't see Mango in the nude. This is a blue movie, you know? l know. lt's good that you know. lt doesn't have to be artistic like Wong Ka-Wai but a commercial film like Wong Jing's. lf you let me change the cast, l'll do it. What... change cast? No cast, then there's nothing l can do like them. l just want to have my message in the film. Message? No one's interested in your biography. There's no point in making an art movie. Nonsensical movies are good too. Wong's film still holds the highest box office record in past years. Let's see the midnight show tonight. Then you'll understand better. What kind of a movie is this? Money back. lt's great, amazingly creative. Now you see. How the audience enjoy it, swearing, laughing.. This is it. "Love words from my heart to you..." l told you not to see this movie. l thought it was car racing film. Which movie did you just see? "Chinese Torture Chamber Story" Any comments? l don't know what it's about. But it's pretty good, l'd give it a 4 star. Good story, see whether we can copy its concept directly? How to copy? Use your brain. Wait here l'll check the box office. Which movie did you just see? "A Streetcar Named No Wheels" How would you grade it? l'd give it a lousy 2 stars. Crap! Don't know what it's all about. Fuck it, it's lucky to get 1 star. Not even a car racing scene, it's lousy, cheating film. The Director deserves to be shot. Wait... What? Let's take a picture first. What for? Director Yee, stay. Any comments on your movies bad reviews? l think everyone has the right to give opinion, to choose. Someone wants to hit you. Any comments? Do you feel you've failed as a Director? Not in this way. -Excuse me -Director... You know the box office collection of the sex film? Almost $1 million for one midnight show. But his film is bad. Collected only $7,000 in 24 theatres and 3 of them have no one, empty. Look, "A Streetcar Named No Wheels". A car with no wheel how to drive, it's a definite loss. Who'd want to invest in such artistic bullshit. Cut Not again? Your acting is good but you've missing one thing. Someone left you, this time you need to... Are you Derek Yee? Yes. l'm Derek Yee. Come on... One more take, right now. OK, ready? Action Cut. What do you think? ls it okay? "The Best Director Yee, dives to death." "Bad reviews to the over budget film 'A Streetcar named No wheel'." "His 'boyfriend' finds a new half." "All knock him down badly." l can't imagine he'd kill himself. His movies were quite good. That was in the past. His last words: the audience has the right to choose. So the audience chose not to see his movie. ls he really Derek Yee? John's brother? lt's amazing... What is it? The box office shot up after his dealth. Why? lt collected $300,000 for the afternoon show. Derek's dealth made the movie work. Soon it'll break Jackie Chan's box office record. So what's good about it. We've lost a talented Director. Why so sad? He's not your father. Let's go support him to see his movie tonight. l've complimentary tickets. Since you're paying, let's karaoke too. How could he miss it . l've not the talent making movies, l should just quit. You don't need talent. You need hard working. What else can you do? Be a football player? Watch the game. l've tried to and like to be a football player. What the hell is the referee doing? Penalty kick. Shit. They'll lose this time. lt's you to blame, now we lose. Don't do it if you can't. l'd quit if l were you. Right, actually we can win without you. Go away, don't waste our time. You're a lousy football player. No. No need. Why not! lt's the best idea. What's missing from our film? Publicity! Talk of the town about a naked woman at the temple shooting. Why don't we shoot an X-rated scene on the street. lt'll be a hot new for sure. Let's just do it, it'll work. No kidding? Easy! Take it like you're helping me out. Or just help the film. Your past movies weren't that special. The boss may terminate the production any time. Tell me. What will you do if l kill myself? A young Director kills himself because of an ass-hole producer forced him to shootsex scene in the street. Ass-hole, that's good idea. Set-up the camera and no fooling around, okay? Then ask Wah to fondle Mango's breasts. You got it? Now go ahead. Director, you'd better come now. Miss Mango is angry. Call the Director right now. Where's he? Ask him to come. OK, l'm coming. Director, are you coming? What's wrong? She's flaring up. Miss Mango, what's the problem? Why did you change the location to the streets? l won't do it. lt's not my idea, it's the boss and the producer's. So we changed it. Don't worry, l'll make you look beautiful in the film. lt won't look cheap. l won't let him touch me. Okay, l'll not let him touch you. Just pretend, l'll stop if he touches you, OK? l'll just do it on one take only. OK...Once, only once, l wish too. Pretend? How can it work? No sweat...call her out. What the hell am l doing now? Director. Wah. The scene starts when you face her. l know what to do. Don't worry. Thanks Wah. Dicky, set the camera here. lt's better to use a hand-held camera. Hand-held? Well, we've to improvise in this situation. Who is she? Miss Mango. l'll do this only once. Okay. Wah, are you ready? l'll do my best. OK. No rehearsal. Camera, Dicky. Who's the director? Start. Beat it. Jesus, what are they shooting here! Wonderful! Grab her...grab her...now. Excuse me, there's nothing to see. Don't block it, her tits. Damn, who's blocking the camera? Are you out of sense? l quit now. You're bastard! Why they shoot such immoral film here. Mrs Chan, Let's go. There's nothing to see. You idiot, you said we're just pretended. lt's not now everyone has seen my body. l quit now. You think that l enjoy to shoot such thing here. Why are you so fierce. We're from Eastweek Magazine. We're from TVB 60 Minutes Plus. -Aunty. -Yes? Why don't you watch the TV? Too much TV tires my eyes. How about listening to the radio? No, You're busy, don't mind me. You're home. Go and chat with your Mom. Come here. Lucky l'm here. l just saw you on TV News shooting that movie. Really? Don't let May know. l didn't tell her. l only ask her. Are you busy shooting the Sex educational program? Not all women are as open-minded as your Mom. She's just a girl. lf her friends know you're doing porn, she'll feel bad. But when l was young, your Dad and l watched many good erotic films of Mr. H. C. Lee. They were not bad. Even though many people criticised him. What's the time? About 8pm. 8:00p.m.? l'd better go. lt's hard to get a cab at this hour. Mom. You should spend more time with May. l know. You should go out and have fun too. l'm too old to fool around What's important is that you're happy and healthy. Have a simple life. Let me have it. Go back. You must pay attention to the actresses' feet. They always looked dirty in many old movies. Remind them to keep it clean. Bye. Where's your mom? She's gone. Why don't we have dinner with her. Go and visit her often. She loves you and likes to be with you. Why women need care always? What kind of report is that? They just make it up. They're always writing trash. Did you really hit someone? Not me, is it you? Wrong, l only used one hand. l saw fatty did it. l saw him. He wouldn't be able to stand up if l were to hit him. You better believe it. Director, Mango is really quitting. Yes, she's really angry, what shall we do? Where's the producer? -Let me tell you. -l know it's my fault. lt's my fault for hiring him, please don't be mad. l'm stupid... -lt's good that you admit it. -Yes... Kui. Help Miss Mango to change. She's O.K. now, the script has been changed a little. The original has Mango kissing Wah, now it's reversed. lt's a big difference! You better have it rewritten. The erotic elements should be important than the story. Buddy, it's hard to persuade her, please help me. Do you feel hot? Use some effort. Miss Mango. Wah, kiss her like you did just now. You can only kiss my hand and leg, understand? No problem. Can we start now? Roll it, Start recorder, Action Mango flirt with him. Wah, kiss her more passionately. Kiss her. Yes, kiss her. More ecstasy. Miss Mango. Need stronger reaction. Wah, more. Suck her. More lower... More forceful, kiss her toes. Kiss it, suck it. Harder. Suck the toes. Wah, more. Right... go on. Kiss it. More passion. Kiss her. lt's so ticklish. Don't, please don't. Right, kiss it. Suck it. Wonderful! Cut. Wait. Chung, come here. Come. l think, we've to set some based line here. Did you see Wah's reaction? ls it wah's or your based line in question? Wah has no based line. l pay him and he does whatever l say. Yes, but let's not overdo it. Overdo? lt's just kissing toes, no big deal. lt's hard to convince Mango to do it. What? You want to play me now? lt's all my fault, please calm down. Well, let's skip this scene. Again? We've always been passing scenes. Well, l'll do better in the next take. Wah, stop protecting him. So what if he pays you money. No big deal. What money? This is about professional etiquette. Etiquette? Don't talk about it with me. Otherwise you wouldn't ask me to shoot on the streets. What are you talking about? You agreed to it. What can l say? l had to agree. You told me otherwise the Boss would stop production. Yes, you didn't do a good job. lf it weren't for me, the Boss had stopped it already. Your bad directing is to blame. Why'd you say that? Yes, if you were a good Director, your past two films wouldn't have flopped. Don't insult my movies. You've not a good reputation in this industry, too. For all we know that. No one would help you but me. What help? To start this production. So, do you want this production or not? Fine, stop it. No problem. l hate making pornography anyway. Alright, you said it. -OK, you quit. -Yes. l'll do it... now. Everyone ready. Stand by What are you waiting for? Are you going to direct? Do it yourself. -Wah, lights off. -OK. Fine... That's it for today. You often said you don't want to do porn. Do you know who's really against it? Thank You. What? l didn't do anything for you. l'm just doing what's right. l'm just doing what the Director wants. lt doesn't mean that you're right or wrong. We've saved your face, so what's our next move? Will they stop production, Dicky? Or just change the Director? Chung had suspended the production for 2 days. The Boss is very angry, so what to do? l've not received my second payment. l'm worse, l've not paid 3 months credit card bills. Don't worry, l'll... discuss it with the Boss tomorrow. No point, let's think of another solution. You should tell me your period come. lf all like you, how can l make a living? Asst. Director, get a replacement. Any good ideas for me today? Of course. How about innocent schoolgirl, erotic S&M. Demark home-town whore You name it. Which do you like? l want a man with two girls, a threesome. No problem. Action. Fondle her. Cut. Good. Thanks... Yes. Come, next time, promise. That was great, call me if you've another good stuff. Sure. Why'd you take my money? You're a filmmaker, don't have to be so cheap. Boss Wong, l think about it carefully. Why don't you fire Chung. Without him the film will do much better. Boss, l know you're a reasonable person. Your money is hard earned money. lf you give me a free hand on the film, l surely will... - Are you Sing? -Yes. Who are you? l don't know you. What's going on? Boss. l know you're reasonable, so l think... Yes, if you think the problem is the script, why don't you rewrite it. Problem with the script? Chung told me last night. The story is illogical and you want to rest few days. That's okay, it makes sense. But can you tell me about the changes? Want a drink? Water please. No water, only ice, do you mind? No, l'll help myself. Actually... l've not... l've not thought... l'd rather tell you when it's ready. Chung tells me you're very artistic. Talented, l'm sure you'll think of something. Don't worry, Chung said you can. l know you can. Chung. l want to tell you. Sorry. -How could you say that? -Please come in. Don't be like that... -l tell you... -l've called tomorrow's working notice. Do it or not, it's your choice. l'm too old to talk art with you. lf you can do it, l'll not interfere. Just don't go over budget. l want to see you do a great movie. And not a piece of shit. lf you won't do it, let me know sooner. lt's you again. How's it going? How's the script? What about you? How is your film? lt's on hold, something's not quite right. Me too. Do you know Director Derek Yee? l met him before. Why? l spoke to him the night he commited suicide. l talked to him. Really? He told me he started out as an actor at 1 7. l was an actor at 1 7. When l was 27, my teacher told me... The ancient action film is dead. lt's better to go and find another job. l was angry to hear that. He started me in this field, 1 0 year later, he asked me to quit. Those 1 0 years were for nothing. Nothing, don't you think so? Then one day, a Director asked me... He said an actor can do something else. Try being a Director. l didn't know what to do. l told him when l decide to be a Directror, l'll call him. Three years later, l called him. Because l made my first movie, "A Story of Mad Director". So, never give up. lf you're such a smart thinker, why choose to die? l'm human, l've weaknesses, ... sometimes you will do stupid things. lf give me another chance, l'll not choose death. Thank you. Hey! Come here... No... Come... Chung, what's wrong with the flower? No problem. Sunny, did you find him? No one answered the phone. -So page him again. -OK. Director. Sorry l'm late. The camera's all set up. No, l change the lines. -Let me talk to Wah and Mango first. -Fine. Dicky, set up the track here later. How long? l don't know, l'll tell you later. -Good morning Director! -Good morning! l rewrite the script... l want to re-shoot scene 9. What! A re-shoot? Have a look at the script first. Dicky, l'll let Mango sleep here. Action! No... - No... -Cut! -Director, next is Wah's shot... -Wait. Director, what's wrong? Mango. Although in this scene, your faked orgasm will make Wah high. l need you to make it more realistic. How will the audience know it's faked? They will know. You've to act it out well enough to cheat them. Then they believe that it can be real enough to arouse Wah, get it? l get lost. How do l do that? l'm sure you've had sex experience. That's what l need you to do... Think of the best orgasm you've ever had. And act it out. That's what l want. Convince me it's real. Do you get it? Let me think about it. OK. Wah. Yes, Director. Tell me, have you experienced... Not being able to make love. Haven't you? Once, l don't know why... Perhaps l was too nervous... lt was a long time ago. How did you feel? Very sad. Very sad...do you feel shame? No, just scared. Can you act out that feeling again... That feeling? l'll try. l'll try my best. OK, let's get ready. Dicky, zoom in closer and track slowly on the next shot. Got it? Action! Cut! Again Cut! What's wrong? Again Cut! Director, what do you want? -Towel... -No... Your sole is dirty. OK, let's try again. Come closer, l don't have thorn, do l? Action! Cut! OK, Great job. Give them their robe. Take a break first. Dicky... Set the camera here. -Sunny. -Yes. Look for few young extra, but not teen, get it? Yes, l know. What? Something's different with you today. Do l. l've to make a call, my pager's ringing. l'm buying, what do you want to drink? lt's so noisy, what's going on? l'm doing aerobics. How about you? You're still angry at me. l'm not. Even lf l am, you won't care. l'm the one who's doing all the callings. No, l wanted to call you too. Really? l can't keep up with the aerobics. l'm so bad. When are you coming home? Soon. Right after work. You'd better work now.. Alright, enjoy it! Bye. Excuse me. lsn't that Director Wong? l like his movies. How can you like his awful movies. What coincidence. Director Wong, you're doing a movie with Stephen Chow. lt's a definite blockbuster. Starring Stephen Chow and Jet Li. lt's a breakthrough, ... it's musical this time. But l'm waiting for the Boss' approval. Director Wong, no one dares to say 'No' to you. That's not true. Forget it, it's just bullshit. My best cinematographer is truly a best cinematographer. l heard you're making pornography now. You don't need good techniques, ... but don't make it badly. Or else the Boss will fire you again. But don't worry, ... we're buddies, you can work for me. l can set up another crew and let you, be my third unit cinematographer. Why did he talk to you like that? Everyone knows he's such an ass-hole. Dicky, you're worked with him before. My first movie was directed by him. He fired me. He said my lighting is too dark. People wants to see the artistes but not gloomy stuff! After that no one wants to hire me... One more beer! Don't drink too much. Everyone know l'm the best cinematographer. But a lousy drunken type. OK, l'll drink with you. l'll be the "drunken" Director tonight, OK? -We're the best "drunken" team, right? -Yes. Bring us the beers! Come in! "Viva Erotica" "3rd Revision 23rd May, 1 996." "The orange light looks better than the red." "lt's brighter, feels warmer." A lot of Japanese directors started out making porns. -You okay? -l'm alright. This film called... "Maniacal Family" Directed by the one who did "Sumo Do Sumo Don't" -Really? Yes, -l like it. Come on, l'll show you some more and better. lt's here, look at this box. See how great is his hand-held style of shooting. But you can't use his method so often. -lsn't it great? -Yes, lt's excellent. See more of it and you'll tell what's good and bad. But remember not to rush things. lt's enough to be one or two steps ahead of people. Also look at the editing. How he cut in the scenes smoothly. lt's strange. l don't know if l should tell you. Well, don't tell me then. Just have a drink. l waited for him all night long last night. l know he was busy. He didn't come home. l wanted to page him but l was afraid to bother him. Don't want to be so troublesome. He has work pressure, so do l. He cares only for his work. lt's hard on me. Leave him then. My husband's a Director too. He was also living in his fantasy world. He didn't know how to care for his family or himself. Just like a kid. Some of them will never grow up. Then it's bad, like Sing's father. Look at me, you will know.. Talk to him about it. Unless he changes, you'll be unhappy. He won't like it if l tell him. You've thought about it better. l'm okay, l just need to talk to someone. You settle it amongst yourselves. When you're free, call me. -Wah, Mango. -Director. This scene is when the two of you just have met. You like her but she's only interested in the money. You negotiate with her. You've no sympathy for her and just grabbed her, grab her leg. Grab her and then... Then say your lines. -Director, please have a look to the camera. -OK. -You two discuss the scene first. -OK. lt's a problem. Mango, was he rude to you the other day? Don't be a rumour monger. You're pitching him against me, also to the others. l know what you are thinking of. You must be doing the same to me too. l know, l was like that before. l've sworn not to gossip anymore. lf no gossip, what else is there to do? Why don't you gossip about yourself? Why is that? lt's erected and ready! Come on. Don't you like me anymore? You like someone else? Crazy! Why haven't you touched me for so long? You've not hugged me for a long time? Are you tired from making the movie? Yes, l am. Why don't you quit if it's too hard on you? The anti-vice officer told me that Mango is very sexy. She has good figure and is prettier than me. You like her! Will you leave me for her? Crazy! Why quit when everything is going smoothly? What the hell's the matter with you? You still don't trust me! You're crazy! Shit! Come on. Don't disturb the neighbour. Go to sleep. What's this made of? lt's too sticky. lt's from egg white. Sticky looks better. lf too thin, it doesn't look spermy, it makes a man look weak this way. lt matches his character. Forget it, you're supposed to be impotent in this film. Just in this film, but not in my real life. l got it. What's this? -Sperm -Sperm?! Doesn't look like it, it's too sticky. What's it made of? -lt's the real thing! -Really?! Yes! Sorry, because l drank less water lately... Wah, let's finish the scene we skipped. Relax, just position correctly. Mango, any problem? What are you doing, open the door. What's this? Shooting porngraphy? Show me your lD! -Who's in charge here? -Me. Show me your lD. -What he says? -l'll take care of it. lt's okay, l know him. He's your boyfriend making the porno film. Alright, there's no problem. -Mango? -Aren't you? Can we take a picture. Sure, no problem... Jupiter, get the camera. 1 , 2, 3 Lucky you were there or we'd be in trouble. Your colleagues are so nice and friendly. What are you doing? l'm leaving. Are you crazy, why? Did you sleep with her? No, l didn't. Do you know who l'm talking about? You were afraid when l saw her holding your shirt. You immediately hugged me. That you've never done it to me before in public. You were afraid to look at her when taking the picture. OK, everyone ready, 1 , 2, 3... ls there something wrong? l'm sure you fantasized about her. Yes, l thought about it. l'm a man, l can't stop myself from fantasizing. So does every man. You're not leaving because of it, are you? No, l'm not. Why then? l can't take it anymore, l'm so unhappy with you. We're more like room-mates than lovers. -How's it? ls it okay? -Good. Girlfriend problems again? lt's nothing. -Sometimes a woman... -Alright, l understand. Dad works here, studio C, understand? Let me introduce you to the leading lady. Miss Mango. -My wife Gin. -How do you do. Come here. Say hello. He's my son. Don't be shy, go. lt's candy for you. Say thank you. Thank you. Director. Wah, you're early? l'm taking my family around the studio? -My wife Gin -Hi, Director. Hi, Gin. -Son, say hello to the Director. -Director. He's cute. -l'll take you over there. -Alright. Director... Quarreled with your girlfriend? This is the 1 0th time people asked me today. Women are so troublesome. You've to be gentle with her. You'll regret it if she leaves you. l think so too. She asked me to do this film in the beginning. Now she's arguing with me for the same reason. Same to me, when l told my wife l'll be in a porn film. She said, "okay, it's just a job." But she's really uncomfortable with it. So l tell her whenever l've the bed scene. Let her know and stop her imagination. -Papa! -l'm coming! -Director, l'm going over awhile. -OK. Help, quick help me... OK... No more... -Mango dry your sweat. -Thank you. All the rumours aren't true. What's not true? Wah's a bad man and a sex-maniac. He's quite shy actually. How nice to see such a loving family. l want to have my baby before 30. And a very loving husband. He'll give me the security. l was from a very poor family in Taiwan. My parents were constantly fighting. l felt l had no future l was so poor. l didn't want to study anymore, so l came to H.K. l wanted to be a star and earn lots of money. Lots of money and give my parents a better life. Am l greedy? No, everyone's like that. l'm greedy too. l like you but you have no money. You're breaking my heart. Silly girl. Let's get back to work. There we are, alright! Standby. -Roll. -Speed. Track. Action! Cut! Thanks! Let me see. -We've finished -Good! HK Film Award this year, the Best Director goes to... Sing! lt's on fire! lt's on Fire! Help! Wallace, go and see what happens. lt's smoke powder, put it off. Hurry, put out the fire! lt's hot! lt's on fire! Leave lt! lt's too late... The fire is spreading quickly, let's go! Where's the negatives? ls everybody out already? Sunny? Where's Sunny? Sunny! Sunny. -The patient needs rest, not stay too long OK? -OK. Sunny, How do you feel? l'm fine. How's the film? Everything's okay. That's good. My face... Don't touch it or it'll be inflamed. Will it be scarred? Crazy! Of course not? Hello, Boss?... Yes... l didn't expect the set had burnt down like this, l know l'm to blame, it's my fault. l don't know it's happened that bad Don't blame yourself. lf it weren't you, all the film would have been burnt. You did well. -Then could l ask you... -What? Any complimentary passes for me for your first show? Of course, you're a part of the crew. Really! Then my name will be in the credit roll. Yes. lt's my fault, l didn't safe the film properly. No it's not. lt's accident. l should take full responsibility for it. Why're you arguing? Let's start shooting again. The set has burnt, how to re-shoot? l've made up my mind. No, listen... Don't bother me! l won't invest another cent more. l should have profited if the set weren't destroyed. Now you're still asking me to invest more? Fuck you! l'm a business man, not an artist like you. Boss, in order to profit, the film must be released. All we need just a little more money to complete it. Sugar-Daddy, please let us finish the film... Shut up, woman. What a big mouth! l'm not a fool, this film is not releasable. Just edit it, whatever is left for the European underground market. Also settle Sunny's case too. Make sure he doesn't complain to the Labour Dept. l won't compensate him. l'll settle the last instalment. That's great, we've all heard it. For payments ask him, not me. How can it be, you're not paying? What did you say? Just because the triads can be unreasonable? l'm fucking unreasonable! So what! Fuck you! The worst producer, director and crew. You're lucky to have a job. Without me you eat shit. Let's go. Get out! Fuck your mother! Boss Wong, not swearing to my mother. OK, you listen. l fuck your mother... Beat him! Don't think you can fuck with me. l've warned him not to swearing to my mom. But he did, what a son of bitch! Fuck you! What a shit kick! How is it? Do you think l'm internally injured? Just drink tap water you'd be OK. Go and drink from the tap. He face is so pale. lt's better to take him to the hospital. Don't panic, why the hospital? Just give him some Chinese medicine. Producer, what do we do? Don't worry, l'm here. You can kill me but not insult me. He was swearing to my Mom, it's him to start the fight. But you hit him first. l can settle it nicely later. But you must come together, and be united to finish the film. What film! You broke the Boss' nose. We're in trouble, he's going to kill us. Whether you can fix this situation or not. Settle our last instalment, if you want a re-shoot. How can you talk about money to me now. l helped you earn lots of money. Don't be calculative! We work hard for the money. We work day and night, a tough job, man. You're such a shithead! Calm down, have some patience. You're good at being a sycophant. You say l'm a sycophant! What's about sycophant? Can't a sycophant be angry? Yes l'm just an angry sycophant! Sycophant... Everything crumbles when the chips are down. Everyone mistreats me when there's a problem. Please say something. Have l told you l wanted to be a football player before? Because l admire them. Just think, they have to play with... or without spectators. They get jeered when they lose. Buddy, that's the ball game. You can't score a goal everytime, you either win or lose. When you don't perform, the coach will call you out. You may never get a chance to play anymore. My life before is a joke. l never finish what l've started. l quit halfway on my football career. Halfway through my film. Halfway through on my lovelife. When the fire broke out, l dreamt of winning the film award. When l watched this football match, l realize suddenly... Making movies is similar to football, they need a teamwork. l'm glad to have known you, you've helped me a lot. l'm happy to make this film with you all together. Thank you. Good! Bravo! Go to work. OK... Get the film. We're ready now. Let's do it then. Roll. Action! Was that good? Not bad, right? Thank you. Do you remember Chung? He's a director now. lt was his life-long dream. Dicky, the cinematographer is now an actor. He was lucky, he did win the Best Actor Award. But don't get me wrong. lt's nominated by the porn industry. Wah and his family emigrated. Not Canada, but Dongguan, China. Well, Mango. l met her one day. She's not an actress now. Director. l'm not in the film anymore. l think it clearly, since l was nude to the audience. Why just nude exclusively to him, my hubby, yes, l've married. He's a vet. See all my "babies". They're all like you, like playing football. Right? What about my girlfriend and me? We're fine, of course. We're together. Forget it?, l don't want to end up hating you. Hate me then, don't treat me like before. Why? You just pour all your emotions in your movie. What about me? Have you ever cared? l do care about you now. lf so, l won't make anymore movies. Crazy, you're nothing if you don't make movies. Why quit the movies? l love you because you're a filmmaker. l know what's your last question to ask. My feeling after making the porno film? l found out what embarrssed the actors most, which is to be nude in front of people. So if l was the Director, l'll make sure that... all the crew and myself take off our clothes, to be at ease with the actor. May be they'll be more comfortable, and act better in the movie. Let's try it. Come. Director, everything's ready, let's rehearse.
