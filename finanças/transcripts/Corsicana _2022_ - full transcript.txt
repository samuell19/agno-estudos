(fire crackles) (crickets chirp) (footsteps approach) (man coughs) (gun fires) - Halt! That's far enough, negro. - Oh, hold now. I'm just an old Indian freedman. I don't want no trouble. - Then just keep on walking, you won't find any. - Hold on one second. You're an Indian freedman? - Mm-hm. - Maybe we won't be so hasty. - I'm just looking for a little rest. Damn lawman been chasing my ass for past four days. - What for? - I'm a bootlegger. Them lawmen chased me right off the cliff. Lost my horse. Lost my pack horse. Lost all my whisky. Mm. In a lake. 40 feet below. I'll show you. - Hey, hey, hey! - Easy, boy! - I only, uh... I have two bottles. - I smell bullshit. Ain't no lawman gonna chase you for four days, over two bottles of whisky. Brother got a point. - I am a bootlegger. I ran back into town, and I robbed a bank! (bootlegger giggles) But I didn't get no money! (bootlegger giggles) ♪ Glory, glory, Hallelujah ♪ ♪ Glory, glory, Hallelujah ♪ ♪ Glory, glory, Hallelujah ♪ - [Man] Come have a damn drink! You lazy bastard, get over here and dance! Get over here and dance. Come on, boy! (men laugh) (men yell and slur) (bootlegger howls) (men laugh) - [Bootlegger] Fuck them lawmen! (men snore) (crow caws) (birds chirp) (man grunts) - Son of a bitch. Wake up! Wake up! - What? What're you doin'? - God! (gun cocks) All right, all right! Okay, god damn it. - What's up? - Good morning. (bootlegger chuckles) Want some coffee? (man breathes heavily) - Who are you, boy? - Bass Reeves. (gun fires) (brooding orchestral music) (match strikes) (cigar sizzles) (dark music) - That's a mighty fine cigar, Mr. Sanders. I could see you like the finer things in life. - [Sanders] Yes, sir. I do. - [Jack] What's the play, then? - [Sanders] 500 up front and 500 in Corsicana, when they put the deed to the land in my hand. - [Jack] I'd be happy to take your deposit. But it's gonna cost you more to finish the job. - [Sanders] How much more? I need Bass Reeves outta my way. - 1,500. - [Sanders] Well, that's more than I proposed for the Hale brothers' land! - But it's what you'll agree to. (cigar sizzles) Oh, and Sanders? This stays between you and me. - [Sanders] (sighs) Get the job done. Get Bass, get the Hale brothers' land. - Oh, I will. On that, you could be sure. (birds chirp) (dark music continues) (hooves clop) (gun clicks) (Bass groans) - You leaving again now? - Jennie... Wherever this Donner boy goes, he leaves a trail of bodies behind. Men, women, children. (scoffs) It could be you or our kids, next. - What about me? (somber string music) I need you. The children need you. We have not heard from you in almost a year. Ben is 14. Already has your temper. He needs his father. - If I don't stop him, I will have blood on my hands. You understand, Jennie? - Do you understand what it feels like to not know if you're hurt, dead, or alive? If you're ever gonna walk through that door. Do you? (Bass sighs) - You are strong, Jennie. I'll be okay. (Jennie scoffs) - I don't think I can do this anymore, Bass. (Jennie sighs) (footsteps recede) (birds chirp) (suspenseful music) (children giggle) (hooves clop) (children laugh) (children laugh) - [Boy] Mama! Come look! Mama! Horse, Mama. Lots of them! (suspenseful music continues) (hooves clop) Grab me, both. Grab me tight. What do you want? (horse snorts) Just keep on ridin'. There ain't nothing here for you. - Now that ain't no way to greet visitors. (woman breathes deeply) - Y'all ain't visitors. Just keep on ridin'! - I don't think so, ma'am. We're gonna stay for while. (gun cocks) (gun fires) (children scream) (gun clicks) (woman sighs) (children scream) (gun cocks) (gun fires) (horse neighs) (gun cocks) (gun fires) (husband groans) (gun fires) - Yah! Let's go, come on! Yah, yah! (woman sobs) (husband groans) (suspenseful music continues) (cowbell clinks) Who you shooting at, huh? You dumb sumbitch, huh? (distant yelling) - What kind of man leaves his woman without a loaded weapon? (gun clunks) (woman gasps) - Get your ass up here. Huh? Who you shooting at, huh? (husband grunts) - All the rope! Grab all the rope! (husband groans) (men grunt) (tense string music) (husband groans) (woman pants) (cowbell clinks) (husband groans) Are you a religious man? Of course you are. (water splashes) They say it's supposed to keep the evil away. I don't know. (husband growls) - [Henchman] Shut up. (henchman mumbles) (objects clatter) (husband growls) (muffled yelling) - Easy, easy, easy. (distant yelling) (men laugh and grunt) (door thuds) (distant yelling and screaming) (children scream) (husband growls) - Slow and easy. - Here's the sport of it. Every time I hear that cowbell ring, I'm gonna take a finger. Hers. On that, you could be sure. (tense music) (fly unzips) (Miller screams) (husband growls) (gun fires) (husband growls) (Miller pants) (husband growls) (husband growls) (men yell) (husband growls) (crickets chirp) (Miller sighs) (Miller laughs) - I say it good, boy. (Miller laughs) (Miller pants) (Miller chuckles) Looks like I humped her to death, gentlemen. (laughs) You're welcome. (laughs) (henchman chuckles) (hands clap) The hell you looking at? (muffled thunder claps) I couldn't hear you. What'd you say? (hand slaps) Huh? What'd you say, boy? - Aww, hell, it don't make a damn, 'cause we done run out of fingers. (gun fires) (muffled thunder claps) (Miller chuckles) (Miller chuckles) - Yeah? Two could play that game. (gun cocks) (muffled thunder claps) (tense music continues) (Miller chuckles) Whoa, gentlemen. (Miller chuckles) I'm just playing along with the game. That's all. (Miller chuckles) (gun fires) (cowbell clinks) Yeah? Just playing along with the game. (chuckles) Just playing with the game. (spur rattles) (Miller moans) (spur rattles) (gun clicks) (spur rattles) (Miller chuckles) Hey. - Y'all feel that? He's comin'. You feel that? He's comin'. You feel that? (hooves thump) (horse whinnies) (Jack breathes deeply) He's comin'. (horse whinnies) (hooves thump) He's comin'. He's comin'. (horse snorts) (hooves thump) (Jack breathes deeply) (boy coughs) Sacrifice. (tense string music) Sacrifice. Sacrifice. A sacrifice. (Jack breathes deeply) (boy coughs) (tense music continues) (birds chirp) (horses snort) (ominous tones) (brooding orchestral music) (birds chirp) (suspenseful percussive music) (flesh squelches) (brooding orchestral music) - [Woman] Are you okay, Reverend? - I'm okay. But... - But you're starting to feel the weight of the world on your shoulders? Are you not? Everything that has or will happen is in the hands of our Lord and Savior. Your words have held our community together, and given them hope. - It's getting late. I think we both need some rest. I'll walk you home. - I'd like that. (door opens) (somber ethereal music) - [Bass] Sam. - What do you want, Bass? - [Bass] This boy needs help. He's been beaten, and he's been stabbed. Infection done set in. - Oh, my. What happened? Oh, he's burning up. Quick, lie him down. I'm gonna need some water to help keep his temperature down. Oh, you poor thing. (woman moans) Oh, you poor thing. I assume you're a lawman? Because I've never seen him. - A Federal Marshal. - When's the last time you had something to drink? - (sighs) Um, the day, yesterday. - My word. Why didn't you say something? (sighs) Poor thing. He's so hot. Mr. Bass? Your knife? (fabric tears) I'm gonna need you to start a fire and boil some water. We need to sterilize as much cloth as we can. Use shirts, handkerchiefs. Anything you can find. Oh. - It's gangrene. We're gonna need some alcohol. You kidding me, right? (Sam sighs) - I'll go into town and fetch some whisky. - There's no time. Will this suffice? - I believe it will. - It's medicinal. (Tom sighs) (crickets chirp) (suspenseful music) - [Sam] You gonna take me in? - [Bass] Mm. Well... You are still a wanted man, Sam. - [Sam] There's no coincidence you bringing that boy to my church. - [Bass] Yeah, well... We rode together for years, and I think I know you better than you know yourself. - [Sam] You and your posse had me dead to right that night. I've never known you to miss anything inside 50 paces. You were no more than 10 when you missed me. (Bass chuckles) - [Bass] No, sir. I didn't miss. I put that bullet exactly where I intended. - [Sam] How'd you know I was here? - [Bass] Well I've known you've been here for about three years now. But you killing 16 men in five days? (Bass sighs) I found this on the boy. Out there on that farm. - [Sam] You know whose it is? - [Bass] It's Jack Donner's. He's been putting them on the victims, ever since he killed your wife and your son. I am going after Jack Donner and his men. - [Sam] When's your posse arrivin'? - [Bass] It doesn't. But I ain't going alone. (sighs) You give that a look-see. And I hope I will be seeing you soon. (footsteps clack) (spurs clink) (door slams) (muffled footsteps recede) (ominous tones) (crickets chirp) (dark music) (birds chirp) (Sarah spits) (gun fires) (crickets chirp) (gun fires) (gun fires) (gun fires) (birds chirp) (brooding ethereal music) (hooves clop) (brooding music continues) (distant hooves clop) (water splashes) (water splashes) (Bass pants) (horse snorts) (crickets chirp) (chair creaks) (chair creaks) (crickets chirp) (spoon scrapes) (gun cocks) About time. What took you so long? (Bass slurps) - Face it, Bass. You getting old, and careless. - Why you say that? - 'Cause you didn't have no idea I was on you, till it was too late. - Really? - Really. - Mm. (Bass slurps) Well... Let's talk about it over dinner. (Bass chuckles) Mm. (Bass grunts) Welcome back. - It's good to be back, Bass. (suspenseful music) You never said where we was goin'. - Corsicana. - Why in the hell would Donner and his boys be going to Corsicana? - Donner and his gang were hired to terrorize and kill anybody that get in their way. - [Sam] Why? - Oil. - [Sam] Oil? - Yep. Seems a cattleman was digging a new well. Instead of hitting water, he hit oil. - [Sam] I ain't heard of oil west of the Mississippi. - See, their land is owned by two brothers. Cattlemen. And a oilman out of Virginia has made 'em several offers to buy their spread, but the Hale brothers refuse to sell. - So you murder and kill one of the brothers and his family, the other inclines to sell it cheap. (Bass sighs) How you know all this? - A couple of weeks ago, I found one of Donner gang's left their own, gut-shot, outside of Sanatoga. According to him, they were hired to kill a family, a couple of days south of Fort Worth. - And you believe him? - I do. Loyalty doesn't mean much, when you've been gut-shot. I just eased his passin'. - Now, I know you wouldn't be going after that Donner and his gang, if there wasn't a lot of money in it for you. - 20,000. For all of 'em. Dead or alive. - 20,000. That's a hell of a lot of money, Bass. - Uh-huh. - If I survive, I'll be set. Might buy me some of that cattle land. Corsicana. - (snickers) The hell you know about cattle? - A damn thing. But I ain't buying the land for the cattle. - Are you a speculator? - I am. (Bass laughs) (birds chirp) (somber music) (knife thuds) (knife thuds) (knife thuds) (gun fires) (knife thuds) (knife thuds) (gun fires) (Sam sighs) (knives thud rapidly) (knives thud rapidly) (Bass sighs) - Why did you become a preacher man? - To repent. I knew those eight other men didn't have anything to do with killing my family. - So, why did you do it? - Rage. (knife thuds) I'm a killer. - Mm. (Bass spits) Yeah. Yeah. We all killers, Sam. And some men just need killing. (gun fires) (glass shatters) Meet California. Our sharpshooter. (tense music) (birds chirp) (hooves clop rapidly) Don't need to be that close. Don't need to be that close. Come on. Come on. (hooves clop) (brooding orchestral music) Come on. (Bass sighs) Look like we got some heavy forest. About a mile past that ridge. It'll be good cover for the night. (birds chirp) (birds squawk) (wings flap) (suspenseful music) (horse snorts) (horse snorts) (birds chirp) (flies buzz) (suspenseful music continues) (flies buzz) - Boy, this is a mess. (Bass sighs) - What do you think? - Three... Four hours. - These were farmers. They left most of all the supplies. Why kill 'em? (Sam sighs) - He's just leading us with more messages. (gun cocks) (suspenseful music) (birds chirp) (California coughs) (foot stamps) - Oh, this poor son of a bitch. - [Sam] No signs of scavenging by wildlife at all. - Huh. Hell, buzzards ain't even found him yet. - Yeah. (sighs) This means they're only a couple of miles away. (Bass sighs) Sons of bitches. (somber orchestral music) (suspenseful music) - We'll tie up here for a bit. - Well, there ain't no sense in unsaddling. You got first watch. - Yeah, the hell I do. I had first watch last night. - And you got it again tonight, too. (tense music) (knife scrapes) - I'll gut you, boy. - Y'all better save some of that fight for what's coming. - You'll be sleeping with your eyes open. - Can I kill him now? - Soon. Real soon. (horse snorts) (Sarah spits) (gun fires) (dark orchestral music) (birds chirp) (hooves clop) (telescope clicks) (dark music continues) (telescope clicks) (horse snorts) (old man sobs) (old man sobs) (old man sobs) (old man sobs) - [Man] Please don't. Please don't hurt me anymore. I'm just an old man. Please. - Hey. Friend. We're not here to hurt you, old man. - What happened here? - They rode in around noon. Acted really friendly. Said they were friends with my boy, Hank. Hank's wife, she asked them to stay for supper. She'd fixed them some stew. (old man sobs) After supper, the one they called Donner, he started shootin', the farmers, and we tried to fight back. He was quick. (sobs) - Why do you think they let you live? - He wanted me to tell what happened. (old man sobs) Oh, God. (old man breathes deeply) (somber music) (horse snorts) This is, this... This is one of our Jeb's. (old man sobs) Oh, God. (old man sobs) (birds chirp) (somber music) (gun cocks) (sack slams) (horse snorts) (horse snorts) (Bass breathes heavily) - They salted the fields. This land is useless now. (Bass breathes heavily) (gun fires) (horse whinnies) (Bass sighs) (dark percussive music) (hooves clop rapidly) (suspenseful music) - [Sam] What is it? - They doubled back on us. - Why? There's no way they could know we were behind 'em. - They know now. - Well, the only place they're headed that makes any sense is Eagle Pass. - Huh? Why? There ain't nothing out there. No settlements, no shortcuts, no nothin'. - He's right. I was out here a few years ago. A couple old farmhouses about a day-ride, down this trail. - How far? - Oh, the way they're headed? More than a day. - [Bass] And? - And there's a shortcut. Biska Ridge area, near Richmond Crossing, could shave off a good five or six hours. - All right. Mount up! - Bass. It's gonna be dark within the hour. Been riding all day. These horses need rest. - Come on. Come on. (hooves clop rapidly) (ominous music) (fire crackles) (crickets chirp) (Bass groans) - So, uh... How do you know this area so well? - The war. - You Union? - Yep. - Blue. And true. (bottles clink) - Yessir. (Bass and California chuckle) (somber string music) I'll tell you the scariest thing I saw, was old Bass here, was playing a card game with his master. Colonel. Colonel accused old Bass of cheatin'. (California chuckles) (fire crackles) (crickets chirp) - (chuckles) All right. I'll call you. What you got, boy? - Well, Master Reeves- - Damn it, Bass! How many times do I have to tell you we're in war time? And as such, you will call me Colonel Reeves. - Yes, sir. Colonel Reeves. Please forgive me. I understand. (Reeves sighs) - What in the hell are you looking at? - Nothing, sir. - Well, go out yonder and fetch me some grub, and be quick about it. - Yes, sir. (crickets chirp) - All right, boy. What you got? Now, remember... (suspenseful music) If you win, I'm a-gonna sell your mama. And I'm gonna have that gal you like. Now you know why we own your people, boy. Straight. (suspenseful music continues) (ominous tones) - I do believe a flush beats a straight. - You illegitimate cheating bastard! (table clatters) (men grunt) (music intensifies) (first thuds) (Reeves groans) (Bass pants) (Bass pants) - You saw? - I did. (Bass pants) - Well, I guess you'll probably get promoted for arresting the negro that attacked the colonel for no reason. - The reason is clear. Haul ass northwest. I'll let the search team know I saw you running east, toward the river. It's not much, but at least it's somethin'. - Thank you. - Don't mention it. One more thing. My friends call me California. - Thank you, California. (fire crackles) (dark string music) (California spits) (Bass laughs) When I looked up, the first person I saw was old California here. (Bass chuckles) When he didn't arrest me, man, hell, I knew he was different. (Bass chuckles) - Yessir. (Bass chuckles) - You still didn't answer my question. - Oh! (Bass and California laugh) I pretty much memorized every square inch in North Texas. That way, I could pass information. Didn't have to write nothing down. Yeah, I was... 17. I infiltrated the 11th Texas Cavalry Regiment. - So, you's a spy? - Oh, yeah. Yeah. I made it work, with this honest face. (Bass and California laugh) - So, what's the plan for sun up? - Gonna be a simple flank and shoot maneuver. (California grunts) Here we go. So... We're set up, and hit 'em from the front, as soon as they get through Eagle Pass. - By the time they know what's going on, it's gonna be too late. - It's kinda like setting a barn on fire. Watch how many animals come running out. (cigar sizzles) (Sam chuckles) Mm-hm. (tense music) (Bass pants) (Bass grunts) (Bass pants) (Bass grunts) (rocks clatter) (Bass grunts) (Bass pants) (Bass grunts) (Bass grunts) (Bass grunts) (Bass pants) (Bass grunts) (Bass pants) (Bass grunts) (Bass grunts) (Bass grunts) (Bass grunts) (Bass grunts) (Bass pants) (Bass grunts) (Bass pants) (Bass pants) (Bass pants) (fire crackles) (crickets chirp) (cigar sizzles) (gun cocks) (ominous tones) (distant hooves clop) (suspenseful music) (Bass sighs) Whoa. (knife thuds) You see what I see? - Looks like five horses. Two of 'em going to the forest. One come back. - Yep. They fallin' apart. Trying to get some rest now. California. We have enough time to get ahead of 'em? - Yep. Oh, we can definitely ambush 'em now. - All right. (tense music) (distant hooves thump) (grass rustles) (guns cock) (tense music continues) (gun cocks) (gun clicks) (gun cocks) (hooves clop) (tense music continues) - Whoa. Listen. Too quiet. (horse snorts) (harmonica music) (Miller laughs) (Miller laughs) - Can I kill him now? - Yep. (eerie tones) (gun fires) (henchman groans) (horse neighs) - Whoa! - Yah! (gun fires) (gun fires) (hooves clop) (gun fires) (gun fires) (gun fires) (gun cocks) (knife thuds) (horse whinnies) - [Henchman] Yah! (tense music continues) (gun fires) (gun fires) - Bitch. (distant hooves clop) (gun fires) (bullet ricochets) (gun cocks) (gun fires) (bullet ricochets) No, no, no! (gun fires) (gun fires) (bullets zip) You son of a bitch. (gun cocks) (gun cocks) (gun clicks) (gun fires) (California groans) (blood squelches) I found and killed your sharpshooter, Bass Reeves! Y'all all right? - I'm all right! (gun fires) (gun fires) (horse whinnies) (gun fires) You dumb sumbitch. Your ass is mine! (gun fires) - Go! (gun fires) (gun fires) (Miller laughs) (gun cocks) (gun clicks) (gun clicks) (gun fires) (bullet ricochets) (gun cocks) (guns fire) (gun cocks) (gun fires) (gun fires) (gun fires) (Doak yells) - Face me like a man! (gun cocks) (gun fires) - You're making me work too hard, Reeves! Pissing me off! (suspenseful music) (gun cocks) (gun fires) (gun cocks) (gun fires) (gun cocks) I'm coming for you, Reeves! (Doak breathes heavily) - I got you now, boy. - Hey! (gun fires) (gun fires) (Doak groans) Yeah, I got you! (Miller pants) (Miller laughs) (Doak groans) (Miller laughs) (Doak groans) (Miller laughs) (Miller laughs wildly) (gun fires) (gun cocks) (gun fires) (bullet ricochets) Oh, sh... (tense music continues) (gun cocks) (gun fires) (gun cocks) (gun fires) (gun fires) (gun cocks) (gun cocks) Oh. (gun cocks) (gun fires) (gun cocks) (gun fires) (gun fires) (gun cocks) (gun fires) (gun cocks) (Miller breathes heavily) (tense music continues) (gun fires) (guns fire) (guns fire) (gun clicks) Who are you? (Sam grunts) (knife whooshes) (knife whooshes) (Sam grunts) (knife whooshes) (Miller groans) (leaves rustle) (tense music continues) (Jack pants) (gun fires) (tense music continues) (Jack pants) (gun cocks) (gun clicks and cocks) - I'm coming for you, Reeves! I'm coming for ya. I hope you made peace, Reeves! I aim to kill you! On that, you could be sure, buck! (guns fire) (bullets zip) (guns fire) (guns fire) (gun fires) (tense music continues) (Bass coughs) (Bass groans) (tense music continues) (Bass breathes heavily) (somber music) (Bass grunts) (Bass pants) (Bass pants) It was always gonna be this way, you colored son of a bitch. You just didn't feel it. (suspenseful orchestral music) (crow caws) (melancholy piano music) (crows caw) - Where am I? (woman speaks foreign language) - What's your name? - Bass. Reeves. What's yours? - Mary Pisachove. It means, "To see and kill." You can stay with us, until you get better. - Thank you. (tense percussive music) (gun fires) (Jack groans) (Jack splutters) (Bass grunts) (Bass grunts) (Bass sighs) (Bass sighs) (brooding orchestral music) (body thumps) (cart rattles) (hooves clop rapidly) (footsteps clack) (boy chuckles) (woman chuckles) (boy chuckles) (birds chirp) (brooding orchestral music) - Is the weight of the world still on your shoulders? (cigar sizzles) (cigar sizzles) (horse snorts) (distant hooves clop) - Looks like you still got the herd in good shape. - [Sam] Can't thank y'all enough for your generosity. - Hell, Tanner, it's all just been sitting around, since Dad passed. How you doing, Marshal? - I'm doing fine, brother Jeff. How y'all doing? - Good, sir. - Good. - Sure we can't talk you into staying here and settling down? (Bass sighs) - Oh, hell no. I'm still in my prime. - Yes, sir. You sure are. (Bass laughs) Good luck to you, Marshal. - Y'all take care now. What are you doing down there? - Well, I speculate I'm standing on oil. - Standing on oil? - That's right. - Is that right? All that here? You sure about that? - It's on my terms, this time. (Bass grunts) We'll see you, Bass. - I'll be holding this for you, Sam Tanner! (somber piano music) (footsteps approach) (Jennie gasps) (Jennie giggles) (Jennie sighs) (Jennie chuckles) Jennie, I'm so sorry. - Shh. Now, for somebody who can't read, you always been good at reading me. Nevermind. I'm just gonna enjoy every moment. (Bass chuckles) Go take a bath.
