( thunder cracks ) YOU'RE BEING TRANSFERRED TO ANOTHER CORRECTIONAL FACILITY FOR A SPELL OF ATTITUDE ADJUSTMENT. IT'S NOT ANY PLAY PARK LIKE THIS PLACE IS. NOBODY THERE CARES WHO SHOT JOHN. WARDEN THERE--HE'S NOT A SOFT HEART LIKE I AM. HE'S GOING TO TEACH YOU TO PRAY... TO WASH BEHIND YOUR EARS... AND TO OPEN DOORS FOR OLD LADIES. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT, MISTER... CULLEN MONROE? YOU THE BOSS MAN, CAPTAIN. YOU THE KING OF THE MOUNTAIN. YOU GIVE, AND YOU TAKE AWAY. I PROMISE YOU ONE THING, MR. MONROE. WHEN YOU GET BACK HERE, YOU'RE GOING TO BE WALKING ON YOUR KNEES AND SAYING "SIR" TO FIRE HYDRANTS. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO CHAIN ME TO A NIGGER? TRASH IS TRASH, BOY. TRASH DON'T HAVE NO COLOR.

Joker: COME ON. YEAH. THIS WAY, COME ON! COME ON! ( men groan ) ( siren ringing ) NOW, HERE'S THE DEAL. WE GOT TWO OF THESE... GET FLOYD CARPENTER OVER AT THE FARM? YEAH, SHERIFF. HE'S ALREADY HEARD, AND HE'S ON HIS WAY. HE'S ALREADY HERE. WELL, IT'S NOT TOO BAD, FLOYD. GUARD AND DRIVER TOOK A KNOCK ON THE HEAD WHEN THE TRUCK ROLLED OVER. STATE BOYS TOOK THEM TO THE HOSPITAL. WHAT ABOUT MY CONVICTS? THEY'RE ALL RIGHT, ALL FOUR OF THEM. JUST A LITTLE SHOOK UP, THAT'S ALL. FOUR? YEAH. WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER TWO? WHAT OTHER TWO? THERE WERE SIX OF THEM WHEN THEY LEFT THE FARM. ALL WE FOUND IS FOUR-- TWO BLACKS AND TWO WHITES. NOT A BLACK AND WHITE CHAINED TOGETHER? NO. YOU BETTER GET THE POSSE TOGETHER, LEROY. THEY'RE OUT THERE SOMEWHERE, AND THEY HATE EACH OTHER. NOW, I'LL BE BACK. DON'T YOU LEAVE WITHOUT ME. FLOYD, UH... WHAT WERE THESE CONVICTS OF YOURS DOING OUT HERE IN THIS TRUCK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT? WORK GANG. THERE'S A CULVERT UP THERE BLOCKED UP, AND WE WERE AFRAID THE ROAD WAS GOING TO FLOOD. HOW COME AN ALERT DIDN'T COME THROUGH MY DEPARTMENT? AND HOW COME THERE WEREN'T ANY PICKS AND SHOVELS IN THAT TRUCK WITH THEM? AND HOW COULD THEY SWING THOSE PICKS AND SHOVELS WITH CHAINS ON? COME ON, FLOYD. ALL RIGHT. THE REAL STORY IS THAT I'VE GOT THIS ACQUAINTANCE. HIS NAME'S NOT IMPORTANT, BUT HE'S IN ANOTHER CORRECTIONAL FACILITY, AND WE HAVE THIS... ARRANGEMENT. I DO HIM A FAVOR, AND HE DOES FOR ME. IF I HAVE TROUBLEMAKERS, I KICK THEM ON OVER TO HIM. AND HE--HE GIVES ME A LITTLE RECONDITIONING. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? LEROY, NOBODY'S GOING TO MISS A COUPLE OF BAD APPLES OUT OF A WHOLE BARREL. THESE GUYS ARE DANGEROUS, REAL DANGEROUS. IF WE DON'T CATCH THEM, THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ASKED TO ME AND YOU. FLOYD, I'M GOING TO SEE THAT THEY'RE LOCKED UP OKAY, AND SAFELY LOCKED UP. YOU CAN DEPEND ON IT. FRED. YO. GO BACK TO THE OFFICE AND PUT OUT AN APB. THEN CALL UP THAT SHERIFF AT JOHNSON COUNTY. ASK HIM IF HE CAN LOAN US ONE OF HIS CHOPPERS. CALL UP DOG MAN, TOO. ASK HIM TO WHISTLE UP HIS HOUNDS. THEN SCARE UP OUR OFF-DUTY DEPUTES AND BREAK OUT THOSE M-16s AND BROWNING AUTOMATICS. YOU GOT IT. ( groaning ) LOOKS LIKE WE GOT US A BAD PROBLEM HERE, BOY. WE GOT US A WHOLE BUNCH OF BUM ACCOUNT, JOKER. ( chuckles ) WHICH ONE DO YOU THINK IS THE BIGGEST? THE BIGGEST ONE, HANDS DOWN, IS WHERE YOU COME OFF CALLING ME "BOY." OH. WE BOTH IN THE SAME BOAT. I'M AFRAID YOU'RE GONNA LET YOUR MOUTH PICK UP MORE THAN YOUR BUTT CAN HOLD, AND THIS BOAT GONNA SINK. THAT MIGHT NOT BE SO BAD... TAKING YOU DOWN WITH ME. YOU TRY TAKING ME DOWN WITH YOU, I PROMISE YOU A WHOLE MESS OF MISERY AND HURT BEFORE YOU HEAR GABRIEL'S HORN. NOW, COME ON! DON'T GIVE ME ORDERS. I SAID COME ON, MAN. YOU'RE DRAGGING ON THIS CHAIN! DON'T GIVE ME ORDERS, BOY! I'M TELLING YOU, NEXT TIME I HEAR YOU CALL "BOY," THERE BETTER BE ONE AROUND. I KNOW WE GOTTA KEEP MOVING. I JUST DON'T NEED YOU TELLIN' ME. HOW MANY UNITS YOU GOING TO HAVE WORKING WITH US, LIEUTENANT? THREE ON SPECIAL ASSIGNMENT. THE APB COVERS THE WHOLE HERD. HAVE ONE OF YOUR UNITS WORK THE GULLIES AND BACK ROADS BETWEEN HERE AND FALLING ROCK. GIVE ME A ROADBLOCK THERE AT THE INTERSTATE. YOU GOT IT. Man: HOWDY, SHERIFF. SERGEANT RANDALL, JOHNSON COUNTY. YES, SERGEANT. HOW GOOD ARE YOU AT FLYING LOW? HELL, ANYTHING OVER SIX FEET, WE GET A NOSE BLEED. HERE YOU GO, THREE CHANNELS, RED, BLUE, AND WHITE. STAY ON THE WHITE. THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN'T REACH US IS WHEN WE'RE REFUELING IN LAKE CITY. THESE ARE SMOKE GRENADES TO MARK OUR LANDING AREAS. ANY CHANCE WE'RE GOING TO DRAW ANY GROUND FIRE? THEY'RE NOT ARMED, AT LEAST NOT YET ANYWAYS. LET'S GET STARTED. SHERIFF, YOU CALL FOR THE CAVALRY? BROUGHT YOU SOME HELP, LEROY. MY CUP RUNNETH OVER. THESE BOYS KNOW THE COUNTY BETTER THAN ANYBODY. THESE BOYS CAN GO HOME 'CAUSE I'M NOT DEPUTIZING THEM. WE'RE ONLY TRYING TO HELP, LEROY. THIS IS MY COUNTY, AND I CAN DO MY JOB WITHOUT ANY HELP FROM YOUR VOLUNTEERS. FLOYD TELLS US ONE OF THESE CONVICTS IS BLACK. IN MY COUNTY, A CONVICT'S A CONVICT. HEY, FRED. HEY. GOT A MINUTE TO WALK THESE GENTLEMEN BACK TO THEIR CAR? I'M SURE I CAN FIND TIME. TELL THEM IF THEY'RE NOT GONE IN EXACTLY TWO MINUTES, YOU'RE TAKING THEM IN AND BOOKING THEM. THE CHARGE IS INTERFERING WITH OFFICERS OF THE LAW IN THE PERFORMANCE OF THEIR DUTY. DOES THAT MEAN I'M NOT ON THE POSSE EITHER, LEROY? YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG ATTITUDE, FLOYD. YOU'RE THE STONE IN MY SHOE, AND I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU OUT BEFORE I START WALKING. START YOUR CLOCK. Fred: WELL, FELLAS, I THINK YOU HEARD THE SHERIFF JUST AS CLEARLY AS I DID. LET'S GET MOVING. WISH I COULD BELIEVE THEY WERE GOING HOME. KEEP THOSE DOGS ON A LEASH UNTIL I TELL YOU TO SET THEM FREE. YOU GOT IT, SHERIFF. OKAY, LET'S DO IT! LET'S GO! COME ON. THIS WAY-- NO, THIS WAY! COME ON. LET'S GO, LET'S GO. COME ON. I GOT IT. ( dogs barking ) HOW MUCH HEAD START YOU FIGURE THEY GOT ON US? OH, SIX HOURS, GIVE OR TAKE AN HOUR. GOT A LOT OF CATCHING UP TO DO. MAYBE NOT AS MUCH AS IT SOUNDS. THEY AREN'T RUNNING ON A FAST TRACK. THIS COUNTRY'S CRISS-CROSSED WITH STREAMS AND BOGS AND SWAMPS. THERE'S VINES AND BRUSH HERE COULDN'T CUT THROUGH IN A MONTH OF SUNDAYS. I FIGURE THE THING THAT'S GOING TO SLOW THEM DOWN MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IS HATE. WHAT'S THAT AGAIN? I WAS TOLD THESE PRISONERS HATE EACH OTHER. HATE WILL SLOW YOU DOWN. WHO YOU TELLIN'? ( helicopter whirring ) COME ON! COME ON! COME ON! COME ON! THIS IS DUMB. AND ROCK DON'T BREAK A STEEL CHAIN, NOT TILL WE'RE OLD MEN IN ROCKING CHAIRS. WE'RE NOT LIKELY TO RUN ACROSS AN ACETYLENE TORCH OUT HERE. YEAH, BUT MAYBE A HAMMER AND A CHISEL AT SOME HARD-SCRABBLE FARM. BOLT CUTTERS IS WHAT WE NEED, BOLT CUTTERS OR A HACKSAW. MAYBE YOU WANT TO GO TO A PAY PHONE TO PUT IN YOUR ORDER, HUH? WHAT'S THAT? THEY'RE LIKELY TO HAVE DOGS, BUT IT'S TOO EARLY TO HEAR. NOT DOGS. I THOUGHT I HEARD A FLYING CHAINSAW. A WHAT? HELICOPTER. SOUND TRAVELS A LONG WAY OUT HERE IN THE COUNTRY. I WOULDN'T KNOW. I NEVER LIVED IN THE COUNTRY. YEAH, I CAN TELL. ( chuckles ) YOU'RE ONE OF THEM THAT'S REAL GLAD TO KNOW HE KNOWS WHAT TIME THE STORES OPEN AND HOW TO GET ACROSS THE STREET WITHOUT GETTING RUN OVER, RIGHT? COME ON, MAN. LET'S GO. WAY'S NORTH, ISN'T IT? YEAH. I SAY WE GO SOUTH. IF THE ONLY REASON YOU WANT TO GO SOUTH IS 'CAUSE I WANT TO GO NORTH, YOU BETTER LISTEN TO ME FOR A MINUTE. THERE'S A TRAIN TRACK RUNS NORTH OF HERE. HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT? I KNOW 'CAUSE I WORKED OUT HERE FOR A WHOLE YEAR WITH THE STATE SURVEYORS. TRAIN COMES ALONG EVERY DAY ABOUT NOON. HOW LONG YOU BEEN IN JAIL? SIX YEARS, WHY? THEN HOW YOU KNOW THAT TRAIN'S STILL RUNNING? I DON'T. BUT A MIGHT-BE TRAIN IS BETTER THAN A SURE NOTHING. COME ON. HOW FAR IS THAT TRACK? 20 MILES, GIVE OR TAKE A MILE. NOON TOMORROW? YEAH. WE CAN'T MAKE IT. HOW'RE WE GOING TO CROSS 20 MILES OF THE ROUGHEST COUNTRY I'VE EVER SEEN IN 24 HOURS? I FIGURE 26 OR 27 HOURS. WELL, WE STILL CAN'T MAKE IT. I CAN MAKE IT. UNLESS YOU ADMITTING YOU CAN'T. MAYBE YOU'RE JUST A BIG CITY MOUTH. LOOK HERE, MASON. LOOK AT THIS MAP. NOW, THIS IS WHERE THEY JUMPED OFF. THEY HAD TO START RUNNING IN THIS GENERAL DIRECTION. OVER HERE'S SWAMP, AND OVER HERE IS SWAMP. AND THIS IS ROCK CLIFFS. THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN RUN IS STRAIGHT THROUGH HERE, DOWN THE RIVER TO THE LAKE. BETWEEN HERE AND THERE IS MARSH AND BOG. THEY'LL NEVER GET THROUGH. YEAH, BUT THIS IS HIGHER GROUND. IT'S LESS IMPOSSIBLE THAN WHAT SURROUNDS IT. ALL WE'VE GOT TO DO IS START AT THIS END OF THE CORRIDOR, WORK OUR WAY BACK, AND THAT POSSE'S GONNA RUN THEM RIGHT INTO OUR ARMS. IF THIS IS A WILD GOOSE CHASE, FLOYD, THEN I-- IT'LL WORK, MASON. NOW, I KNOW THESE BOYS. I KNOW HOW THEY THINK. WE'LL HAVE THEM BACK BEFORE DARK. COME ON! OW! OH, WAIT. OVER THERE. ( grunts ) I OUGHT TO RIP YOUR ARM OFF, NIGGER. DON'T CALL ME NIGGER! I AIN'T NOBODY'S NIGGER! I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SO MAD ABOUT. IT'S JUST A WORD. I DIDN'T MAKE UP THE WORD. I DIDN'T MAKE UP NO RULES. IT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS. AND YOU'RE STUCK WITH IT. DON'T TELL ME WHAT I'M STUCK WITH! I'VE BEEN CALLED BOY AND NIGGER AS FAR BACK AS I CAN REMEMBER, BEING TOLD TO KEEP MY PLACE. GREW UP LOOKING IN THE MIRROR, SEEING BOY AND SEEING NIGGER AND GREW UP HATING WHAT I SAW. NOWADAYS, JOKER, WHEN I LOOK IN THE MIRROR, ALL I SEE IS A MAN, A STAND-UP MAN. WELL, I'M REALLY HAPPY FOR YOU. NOW, CAN WE GET MOVING? AS LONG AS YOU HEAR ME, JOKER, YOU HEAR ME GOOD. COME ON. ( panting ) MAN, WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU? YOU HAVE GOT TO BE AN IDIOT TO ASK A QUESTION LIKE THAT, A MORON. MAYBE YOU WANT ME TO CALL YOU A DOCTOR, OR MAYBE YOU'D JUST LIKE TO SIT HERE IN THIS SHADE ALL AFTERNOON, HUH, JOKER? I'M JUST USED TO BETTER THAN THIS, THAT'S ALL. WHAT COULD BE BETTER THAN THIS? I MEAN, HERE WE ARE IN GOD'S BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY. WE GOT BIRDS CHIRPING, WE GOT BEES BUZZING-- OH, SHUT UP. WE GOT FRESH AIR. SHUT UP! THAT'S THE WHOLE REASON PEOPLE LIKE ME LIVE IN CITIES. CLEAN AIR MAKES US SICK. BUT YOU WOULDN'T KNOW NOTHING ABOUT CITIES, WOULD YOU? NOTHING ABOUT GOOD LIVING? YOU ALL RESTED UP NOW, JOKER? YOU READY TO RUN AGAIN? I'LL LET YOU KNOW WHEN I'M READY. ( helicopter approaching ) YEAH, I'M READY. ( helicopter whirring ) YOU THINK HE SAW US? I HOPE NOT. COME ON. Joker: HE'S COMING BACK. OW! THIS DAMN CHAIN. COME ON, MAN! YOU'RE HAULING ON THE CHAIN! WHO'S PULLING ON THE CHAIN NOW? THIS AIN'T GOING TO WORK. YOU WANT TO WAIT TILL THEY GET HERE? MAN, WE'RE JUST FISH IN A BARREL. COME ON, GET ON MY SHOULDER. GET ON MY SHOULDER! ALMOST. GIVE ME SOME MORE SLACK. I GOT IT. Joker: AAH! HOLD ON, JOKER! HOLD ON! AAH! AAH! HOLD ON! ( groaning ) ( crow caws ) WHAT ARE YOU DOING? GONNA LOOK AT YOUR HAND. IT'S OKAY. HAND NEEDS FIXING. DON'T DO ME ANY FAVORS. OOH. FEEL BETTER? FEELS COOL. YEAH. WELL, WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY, THANK YOU? IT MIGHT SOUND NICE. WHAT DO YOU CARE IF I TALK NICE TO YOU? MAYBE 'CAUSE YOUR DADDY AND YOUR GRANDDADDY NEVER DID, AND I'M LOOKING FOR SOME IMPROVEMENT IN YOUR FAMILY LINE. OKAY, THANK YOU. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, OKAY? YEAH, THANK YOU FOR PULLING ME OUT. I DIDN'T PULL YOU OUT. I KEPT YOU FROM PULLING ME IN. TELL ME SOMETHING, JOKER. YOU BEEN MEAN ALL YOUR LIFE OR YOU JUST WOKE UP WITH SOMETHING ONE MORNING YOU COULDN'T SHAKE LIKE A BAD HEAD COLD? YOU DON'T KNOW A SINGLE THING ABOUT MY LIFE. NO, BUT I JUST THANKED YOU FOR PULLING ME OUT, AND YOU TALK TO ME LIKE I'M NOTHING. WHAT'S EATING YOU, MONROE? WHY DO YOU CARE IF I TALK NICE TO YOU? YOU WANT ME TO TELL YOU SO YOU CAN JUST CHOP MY HEAD OFF. UH-UH, TELL ME. YOU STARTED THIS. NOW, YOU TELL ME. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, I'LL TELL YOU. ALL MY LIFE I'VE SEEN SOME PEOPLE TREAT OTHER PEOPLE LIKE DIRT, BLACK AND WHITE. THERE'S SOMETHING IN ME THAT'D BE HAPPY IF I COULD FIND SOMETHING DECENT IN YOU. AIN'T THAT SOMETHING FOR SOMEBODY LIKE ME TO BE TELLING SOMEBODY LIKE YOU. EVERYBODY I'VE EVER KNOWN JUST LOOKING FOR SOMETHING DECENT, LOOKING FOR SOMETHING DECENT IN SOMEBODY ELSE, LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY TO BE TALKED TO DECENT, TO BE TREATED DECENT, LIKE THEY NEEDED TO KEEP ON GOING. WHAT'S WRONG WITH BEING DECENT? DON'T COST NOBODY NOTHING. JUST LOOKING FOR SOMETHING DECENT. THAT'S ALL. JUST SOMETHING DECENT, THAT'S ALL I'M LOOKING FOR. WHO ISN'T? ( helicopter whirring ) SERGEANT. HIYA. Randall: HOWDY, SHERIFF, DEPUTY. HEY, HOW YOU DOING, SERGEANT? SIT DOWN WITH US FOR A LITTLE WHILE. OKAY. Sheriff Leroy Doyle: THEY STOPPED HERE AND TRIED TO BREAK THE CHAIN. UP TO NOW THEY'VE BEEN RUNNING JUST TO BE RUNNING. BUT NOW THEY'RE MAKING A BEELINE HEADING NORTH. MUST'VE COME TO SOME KIND OF DECISION, WOULDN'T YOU SAY? UNLESS THEY GOT TURNED AROUND, CONFUSED. NOT LIKELY. THEY WERE SMART ENOUGH TO MAKE IT THIS FAR. THAT CHANGE OF DIRECTION'S TOO ABRUPT. FIGURE THEY'RE HEADED FOR HERE. THERE'S A FISH CAMP HERE TRYING TO BE A TOWN. IT'S A CAFE, A GAS STATION, AND A BOAT-REPAIR SHED. THOSE BOYS WANT THAT CHAIN OFF REAL BAD. BOAT REPAIR MEANS TOOLS. YOU GOT IT. JUST KEEP YOUR EYE ON THAT CAMP AND THE COUNTRY BETWEEN IT AND US. YOU BET. ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO! GET IT UP. WE'RE MOVING OUT! ( dogs barking ) HOWDY, MA'AM. HOWDY. MY NAME'S FLOYD CARPENTER. I'M THE WARDEN OVER AT THE STATE PRISON FARM. WHAT DO YOU WANT? WE'RE LOOKING FOR TWO MEN. I'M ONLY LOOKING FOR ONE. THE TWO MEN WE'RE LOOKING FOR ARE ESCAPED CONVICTS. ONE OF THEM'S BLACK, ONE OF THEM'S WHITE. YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING OF THEM, HAVE YOU? SEEN NOBODY SINCE THE POWER COMPANY SENT A POLE JOCKEY OVER HERE TO CUT ME OFF. THAT WAS ABOUT TEN DAYS OR SO AGO. Boy: THREE WEEKS, MA. THIS HERE'S MY BOY CLYDE. HE KEEPS UP WITH THE IMPORTANT THINGS LIKE WASHINGTON'S BIRTHDAY AND FREE CHEESE. YOU TWO LIVE OUT HERE ALONE, DO YOU? OH, YEAH. YEAH, WE HAVE BEEN, EVER SINCE HIS DADDY RUN OFF WITH A TEENAGE LADY BIKER. OH, I'M SORRY TO HEAR ABOUT THAT. IT'S NOT A TOTAL LOSS, THOUGH, 'CAUSE HE PROMISED TO SEND ME A POSTCARD FORM DISNEYWORLD. Mason: COME ON, FLOYD. THEY CAN'T HAVE GOT THIS FAR YET ANYWAY. MA'AM, I'M SORRY TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR TROUBLES, BUT I'VE GOT TROUBLES OF MY OWN. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. WOULD YOU LIKE A CUP OF COFFEE OR MAYBE JUST SIT A SPELL? AFRAID I HAVEN'T GOT TIME RIGHT NOW. WELL, YOU JUST COME BACK ANYTIME, WARDEN, AND I'LL MAKE YOU UP SOMETHING REAL NICE. UH...WELL, I'LL TRY. YOU HEAR? YEAH. THEY GOT DOGS, TRACKING US LIKE FRESH MEAT. HOW FAR? FAR ENOUGH FOR NOW... TOO CLOSE FOR LATER. YOU SWIM? YEAH... AS LONG AS THE WATER'S NOT OVER MY HEAD. WE'LL WADE IN, WORK OUR WAY DOWN, CROSS OVER THE OTHER SIDE. NEVER SEEN A DOG YET THAT COULD SMELL ON WATER. COME ON. ( dogs barking ) Dog Man: SCENT COMES IN WHERE YOU'RE AT, COMES OUT OVER HERE. WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY WENT IN THERE FOR, LEROY, TO TAKE A BATH? ( chuckles ) HOWEVER THEY DID IT, IT WAS MISERY GETTING OUT. ALL RIGHT, BOYS. LET'S GO. HUNT THEM UP. Deputy: PROBABLY FOUGHT THE WHOLE WAY, THOSE TWO. LOOKS TO ME LIKE THEY PULLED TOGETHER. THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO HATE EACH OTHER. IT'S EASY TO HATE WHEN YOU KEEP YOUR DISTANCE. IT'S A LOT HARDER ON THE END OF A CHAIN. LET'S GO. MONROE. FOUR-WHEELED AND READY TO ROLL. KEYS IN IT? BRIGHT AND SHINY. ( alarm beeping and honking ) HEY! ( fires ) ( alarm continues ) LET'S GO! LET'S GO! WHAT'S GOING ON?! COME ON, MAN! COME ON, LET'S GO! ( clicks ) HOLD IT! WHERE DID HE GET THAT GUN? I DIDN'T SEE ANY GUN. WHO'D FIGURE AN ALARM IN AN OLD TRUCK? MAN WIRES HIS JUNK. FIGURE SOMEBODY GONNA STEAL HIS JUNK. CAN'T TRUST ANYBODY NOWADAYS. ( alarm stops ) ( Monroe laughing ) WE ALMOST GOT KILLED. YOU THINK THAT'S FUNNY? OH, IT'S FUNNY, MAN. IT'S FUNNY. FIRST TIME WE TRY TO DO SOMETHING TOGETHER, WE ALMOST GET WASTED. ( dogs barking ) HEY. IT'S NOT A TRACKING HOUND. IT'S AN OLD COUNTRY DOG TELLING US WE GOT TO KEEP MOVING. WAIT. PACE YOURSELF, MAN. PACE YOURSELF. Dog Man: NO LUCK, SHERIFF. MY DOGS CAN'T FIND A SCENT PAST HERE. IT JUST FLAT STOPS RIGHT HERE. THEY WENT INTO THE WATER. THEY CAN WADE A WAYS, BUT THEN IT GETS DEEP. YOU THINK TWO MEN CAN SWIM CHAINED TOGETHER? WELL, THEY DIDN'T GO UPSTREAM. WE'LL GO DOWNSTREAM TILL THE DOGS GET THEIR SCENT WHERE THEY CAME OUT. WHAT IF THEY DON'T COME OUT? THEY COULD SWIM TO THE LAKE. POSSIBLE, BUT NOT LIKELY. DO YOU REALLY THINK WE'RE GOING TO CATCH THESE TWO, LEROY? OUR JOB IS TO DO THE BEST WE CAN, FRED. ALL I KNOW IS THEY'RE MAKING BETTER TIME THAN I THOUGHT THEY WOULD. LET'S GO. ( engine gunning ) Carpenter: IT'S JUST SINKING IN. COME ON, FORWARD! NOW BACK! THAT'S--ROCK IT! YOU SLUGS LEND A HAND. COME HERE AND LEAN ON THIS THING. YEAH, COME ON, PUT YOUR BACKS INTO IT, BOYS. YOU'RE JUST DIGGING IT IN DEEPER, DUMMY. PUT IT IN FOUR-WHEEL! IT IS IN FOUR-WHEEL! PUSH! PUSH! PUSH! COME ON! TOLD YOU WE'D GET IT OUT. THIS TIME--NEXT TIME IN MUCK LIKE THIS IT COULD SINK OUT OF SIGHT. GOOD IDEA, PUT IT OUT OF ITS MISERY. SOMETHING YOU DON'T LIKE ABOUT MY VEHICLE? IT'S A... PIECE OF JUNK. DON'T NOTICE YOU DRIVING YOUR CAR OUT HERE-- ALL RIGHT, KNOCK IT OFF. WE'RE NEVER GOING TO FIND THEM, FLOYD. THEY COULD DISAPPEAR FOR YEARS IN HERE. ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS KEEP WORKING OUR WAY BACK THAT WAY. THEY'LL RUN RIGHT INTO US. THEY COULD RUN TEN FEET IN FRONT OF US, AND WE'D NEVER SEE THEM. LISTEN, MASON, I'M A DAMN-GOOD TRACKER. I'LL BET ANY AMOUNT OF MONEY I'LL HAVE THEM BACK IN THE CAGE BY MORNING. I'LL TAKE THAT BET, AND I'LL MAKE IT EASY ON YOU. SAY...$100? YOU GOT YOURSELF A BET. WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE. HOW COME YOU COMBING YOUR HAIR? YOU FIGURE YOU'RE GONNA MEET A WOMAN OUT HERE OR SOMETHING? OH, YOU OUGHT TO SEE ME ON THE STREET, MONROE. I MAY ONLY HAVE $10 IN MY POCKET, BUT I LOOK LIKE I GOT A MILLION. IT'S THE WAY YOU LOOK THAT OPENS THE DOOR. BUT I WOULDN'T EXPECT A RAG-PICKER LIKE YOU TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING WELL-GROOMED AND WELL-DRESSED. WHY DON'T YOU CRAWL BACK UNDER THAT ROCK YOU CAME OUT FROM UNDER? BET YOU NEVER OWNED A SILK SHIRT IN YOUR LIFE, HUH, MONROE? YOU KNOW WHAT CLASS IS? CLASS IS HAVING TWO SILK SHIRTS, AND THEY'RE BOTH THE SAME COLOR. YOUR CLASS MUST'VE REALLY IMPRESSED THE JURY, JOKER. THEY MUST'VE BEEN SO OVERCOME WITH YOUR CLASS AND YOUR SILK SHIRTS, THAT THEY PUT YOU ON A PRISON FARM, THE SAME ONE THEY PUT ME ON. WONDER WHAT TIME IT'S GETTING TO BE. THIS IS THE TIME OF DAY I'D BE DRESSING UP TO GO OUT. AHH. YOU OUGHT TO SEE MY LADY, MONROE. SHE'S A TV STAR. SAY THAT AGAIN? I SAID SHE'S ON TV. SELLS LINOLEUM. YEAH. EVERYBODY STARE AT US WHEN WE GO OUT AT NIGHT TO A CLUB. YEAH, I BET THEY DO, JOKER. WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT? I'D BE STARING, TOO, I REALLY WOULD. I MEAN, YOU WITH YOUR SILK SHIRTS AND YOUR LADY THAT SELLS LINOLEUM ON TV? MAN, THAT MUST BE REALLY SOMETHING TO LOOK AT, SOMETHING TO WRITE HOME ABOUT. WHY DO I GET THE FEELING I'M BEING INSULTED? MAYBE BECAUSE IT'S YOUR TURN. NOW, COME ON. I TOLD YOU BEFORE, DON'T GIVE ME ORDERS! AND I'M SICK OF YOU JERKING ME AROUND LIKE A KID'S TOY. IT'S TIME WE GOT MOVING, JOKER. AND ANOTHER THING, YOU'VE BEEN CALLING ME JOKER EVER SINCE WE STARTED OUT. JUST ONCE WHY DON'T YOU TRY SAYING MY NAME, MR. JOHNSON, TO SEE IF YOU CAN PRONOUNCE IT. THE LAST THING IN THE WORLD YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR ME CALL YOU IS MISTER. NOW, COME ON. LOOKS LIKE THERE'S RAIN PROMISING. THAT'S THE ONLY THING ANYMORE YOU DON'T GET BILLED FOR. NOW, CLYDE, YOU REMEMBER WHAT YOUR DADDY TOLD YOU. WHICH TIME? YOU KILL ONE POLICEMAN, AND A THOUSAND WILL COME TO HIS FUNERAL. BESIDES, POLICEMEN SUPPOSED TO BE YOUR FRIEND. WHY? THEY AIN'T NEVER GIVE US NOTHING. OH, CLYDE. MA, WHEN ARE WE GOING TO LEAVE THIS PLACE? THERE'S NO REASON TO STAY NO MORE, IS THERE, NOW THAT PA'S GONE? THERE'S EVEN LESS REASON WHEN HE WAS HERE. THEN WHY DON'T WE LEAVE? 'CAUSE I WANT TO RIDE OUT OF HERE ON A MAN'S ARM. THAT'S WHY. MAYBE THAT NICE WARDEN FELLA COME BACK. YOU KNOW, I WAS THINKING HE WAS KIND OF TAKEN WITH ME. WELL, I DO. ( faint country music playing ) DO YOU READ THAT SIGN, JOKER? "MOTOR REPAIR..." "MOTOR REPAIR." TOOLS. YEAH. WHAT YOU GOT THERE, BAIT? ( helicopter whirring ) THAT THERE GUESS OF YOURS MUST'VE BEEN RIGHT, FLOYD. THEM BOYS OF YOURS, THEY HEADING THIS WAY. WHAT'S HE LOOKING FOR? JUST LIKE I TOLD YOU, THEY'RE GOING TO RUN THEM RIGHT INTO OUR ARMS. ALL WE GOT TO DO IS BE A LITTLE PATIENT. ( country music continues ) CAN WE HAVE A LITTLE SERVICE? BE RIGHT THERE. THANKS, PHIL. SEE YOU LATER, LON. Woman: COME ON, LET'S GET HOME. CREAMED TURKEY PLATE? Lonny: WHAT'S YOUR PLEASURE, GENTS? BEEN ANY DEPUTY SHERIFFS NOSING AROUND HERE? NOT THAT I'VE SEEN. DOES THAT MEAN THERE WAS OR THERE WASN'T? CAN'T BE SURE. ONE OF THOSE HELICOPTERS BEEN MAKING PASSES ALL DAY LONG. THEY LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY? ESCAPED CONVICTS, TWO OF THEM. SEEN ANY STRANGERS AROUND, HAVE YOU? NOT THAT I RECALL. I SEEN YOU SOMEWHERE BEFORE? NOT UNLESS YOU'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE. YOU SURE? LIVED HERE ALL MY LIFE. AT LEAST YOU'RE SURE ABOUT SOMETHING. HOW ABOUT THEM CABINS OUT THERE? YOU GOT ANY VACANCIES? TAKE YOUR PICK. ALL FIVE OF THEM ARE EMPTY, AS LONG AS YOU DON'T MIND SOME NOISE. THERE'S GOING TO BE A PARTY HERE TONIGHT. ALL RIGHT, WE'LL TAKE SOME BEERS AND SOME OF THEM CHIPS THERE. WE'LL SIT BACK AND EAT A LITTLE, DRINK A LITTLE. WE'RE GONNA BE HERE YET A WHILE. USE YOUR TIME ANY WAY YOU LIKE. YOU GOT TILL MORNING, AND THAT'S IT. YOU REALLY THINK THEY'LL SHOW UP WITH PEOPLE AROUND? I'LL BET A ROUND OF BEERS ON IT. GETTING DARK, SHERIFF. HEAVY WINDS ARE PREDICTED. I'M GOING TO HAVE TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO YOU NOW. I WAS GOING TO SPLIT MY POSSE, SERGEANT, HAVE YOU HAUL SOME OF MY DEPUTIES UP TO THE FISH CAMP. SORRY, SHERIFF, I HAVE TO GET OUT WHILE I CAN. GOOD LUCK, TO YOU. SO IT COMES DOWN TO THIS. ALL WE CAN DEPEND ON IS WHAT THEY HAD A HUNDRED YEARS AGO-- DOGS AND MEN. THIS STORM ISN'T GOING TO HELP. ( music faintly playing ) ( people reveling ) WILL YOU LOOK AT THAT? ( Monroe sighs ) PARTY. HAVEN'T SEEN FOLKS AT A PARTY IN A LONG TIME. DAMN THEM ANYWAY. WHY DO THEY HAVE TO PARTY TONIGHT? ( woman laughs ) ( both laughing ) DO YOU SEE THAT? HAVING YOUR WOMAN HOLD YOU LIKE THAT? REMEMBER HOW THAT FELT, JOKER? NEVER HAD A WOMAN WAS MINE. THE ONLY WOMAN I EVER HAD BELONGED TO SOMEBODY ELSE. EVEN THAT TV STAR I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT WASN'T MINE. SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH HERSELF. MY WIFE'S NAME'S LOU ANN. HER AND OUR BOY BOTH LIVING WITH HER FOLKS WHILE I DO THE TIME. MAN, NOW THERE'S A WOMAN. WHEN SHE PULLS ME UP NEXT TO HER HEART, FEEL LIKE I'VE DIED AND GONE TO HEAVEN, DON'T EVER WANT TO COME BACK TO THIS CRAZY WORLD. A WOMAN MAKES A MAN BELIEVE THAT SHE CAN'T BE ONE WITH HIM UNLESS THEY'RE MARRIED. AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW THERE'S NOTHING LEFT BUT A PILE OF ASHES. YOU EVER BEEN IN LOVE, JOKER? I WAS ALWAYS TOO SMART TO GIVE MYSELF AWAY 'CAUSE I'M ALL I GOT. YOU GOT TO COMPROMISE, JOKER. YOU GOT TO GIVE UP SOMETHING TO GET SOMETHING. I NEVER GOT ANYTHING, NOT EVER. ( thunder cracks ) Woman: MY FEET ARE GETTING SOAKING WET. Man: GET IN, GET IN. LET'S WAIT TILL THE CAFE CLOSES. ( animals squeals ) WHAT'S THAT? JUST AN OLD OWL, GOT HIMSELF A DUMB BUNNY TOO FOOLISH TO COME IN OUT THE RAIN. Dog Man: COME IN HERE! GET HIM, WILLIE, GET HIM, WILLIE. Fred: YOU GOING TO KEEP US GOING ALL NIGHT, LEROY? THEY'RE GOING ALL NIGHT, AND SO ARE WE. THAT'S SUPPOSITION ON YOUR PART. I'VE DONE SOME OF MY BEST WORK ON SUPPOSITION, FRED. EVEN SO, YOU SAID THAT THERE WAS NO WAY THEY COULD MAKE IT THROUGH THIS KIND OF COUNTRY CHAINED TOGETHER I'M NOT SO SURE. THEY'RE WORKING TOGETHER BETTER THAN I EVER THOUGHT THEY WOULD. WHAT I CAN'T FIGURE IS WHY THE LORD SEEMS TO BE ON THEIR SIDE. WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE THE GOOD GUYS. SAY WHEN. LET'S GO. Monroe: THING'S LOCKED. DAMN. HERE, WORK THE CHAIN OVER, WE'LL PULL IT. YEAH, YEAH. ( doors creaking ) ( grunting ) ( barks ) A LITTLE BIT MORE. GO ON, A LITTLE BIT MORE. SHE'S COMING. COMING--AHH. YEAH. WASN'T NICE OF YOU BOYS TO RUN OFF LIKE THAT... ALL FOR NOTHING. DROP THE TOOL, BOY. STAND AWAY FROM THE BENCH. WHO ARE THEY? THEY'RE NOT THE LAW. WE'RE FROM CHURCH... TAKING UP DONATIONS TO SEND POOR KIDS TO SUMMER CAMP. Carpenter: MY FRIEND IS GOING TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE TRAINING ON HOW YOU'RE GONNA KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT WHEN WE GET BACK. WE CALL IT "BEHAVIORAL THERAPY." DON'T LEAVE ANY BRUISES. Joker: WHAT ARE YOU DOING? LEAVE HIM ALONE. YOU NEVER TOLD ME THESE TWO WAS IN LOVE. GUESS THEY'VE GROWN ON EACH OTHER SINCE I'VE SEEN THEM. I'LL TELL YOU WHEN TO STOP. ( grunting ) THAT'S ENOUGH. ( grunting continues ) I SAID THAT'S ENOUGH! GET THEM UP, AND LET'S LOAD THEM OUT OF HERE. Jeffcoat: WE CAN'T RIDE THEM OUT TILL THE RAIN STOPS, FLOYD. THE ROAD GOES BACK THROUGH THE SWAMP. WE GOT TWO STRONG BACKS TO PUSH. Jeffcoat: NOT IN MY VEHICLE, YOU AIN'T. Mason: YOU MEAN WE'RE STUCK HERE? FOR A TIME. WHAT DO PEOPLE DO AROUND HERE WHEN IT RAINS? THEY STAY PUT. Carpenter: I'VE GOT TO GET THESE MEN BACK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. YOU UNDERSTAND ME? Jeffcoat: THE RAIN'LL STOP BY DAYLIGHT. WE CAN MOVE THEM THEN. ALL RIGHT, TIE THEM UP... TIGHT. WE'LL GET SOME SLEEP. WE'LL GET THEM OUT AT FIRST LIGHT. YOU FELLAS SLEEP TIGHT. COMPARED TO WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO SLEEP TOMORROW NIGHT, THIS IS A GENUINE FIVE-STAR HOTEL. WE'RE LOSING THE DOGS, LEROY. THEY CAN'T KEEP UP. YOU'RE TRYING TO TELL ME A DOG CAN'T KEEP UP WITH A MAN? SINCE WHEN? SINCE THEY BEEN RUNNING ALL DAY. I GOT TO GIVE THEM A BREAK. HOW FAR'S THAT FISH CAMP? THREE HOURS, GIVE OR TAKE SOME. BE LIGHT BY THEN. ALL RIGHT, LET THEM SIT A SPELL. I WANT THEM FRESH. SEEMS FUNNY, WE'RE USING DOGS TO HUNT MEN LIKE THEY WERE DOGS AND TREATING DOGS BETTER THAN OURSELVES. I'M SO COLD. I'VE NEVER BEEN SO COLD. BE COLDER STILL WHEN THEY GET US BACK THERE. WHAT YOU IN FOR, MONROE? WHY YOU WANT TO KNOW? IS IT A SECRET? TRIED TO KILL A MAN... WHITE MAN I WAS RENTING A LITTLE 60-ACRE FARM FROM. WHAT HAPPENED? ME AND LOU ANN ALWAYS WANTED TO OWN OUR OWN PLACE. THIS MAN SAID IF WE... GET HIS FARM IN MINT CONDITION, PROVE OUR GOOD FAITH, HE WAS GOING TO SELL IT TO US. SO? NEVER SAW LOU ANN SO HAPPY. WE WORKED LIKE MULES ON THAT PLACE. GOT IT LOOKING LIKE THE BEST PIECE OF LAND IN THE COUNTY, TOO. THEN ONE DAY HE DRIVES UP IN HIS FINE CAR AND GETS OUT AND LOOKS OVER THE PLACE, TURN TO ME AND SAY, "YOU GOT 10 DAYS TO GET OFF MY LAND-- WHAT? "ON A COUNT IT'S LOOKING SO GOOD, I'M WANNA GIVE IT TO MY DAUGHTER FOR HER WEDDING PRESENT. OH, NO. YEAH. ( sighs ) LOU ANN AND MY BOY STANDING THERE, LOOKING AT HIM, LOOKING AT ME. I'M TRYING TO REMIND HIM THAT WE MADE US A DEAL. HMM. HE LOOKS AT ME WITH THIS BIG SMILE ON HIS FACE. "DO YOU KNOW YOU GOT YOU A SMART MOUTH, NIGGER BOY, REAL SMART MOUTH." WELL, THAT WAS A MISTAKE. AND I WENT AFTER HIM WITH A TWO-BY-FOUR. I MEANT TO KILL HIM, JOKER. I MEANT TO KILL HIM. ALL I DID WAS BROKE HIM UP, THOUGH. I'LL BET YOU BROKE HIM UP REAL GOOD, DIDN'T YOU? YEAH, HE GONNA HAVE "NIGGER BOY" ON HIS MIND TILL THE DAY HE DIE. YEAH. ( chuckles ) WHAT ABOUT YOU? GRAND THEFT AUTO. WHAT? I TOOK MY .38 AND TICKLED A MAN'S NOSE WITH IT...

WHERE WOULD YOU GO IF WE HAD MADE IT, MONROE? BACK TO LOU ANN, BACK TO HER AND MY BOY. NO, YOU CAN'T GO BACK THERE. THEY FIND YOU THERE FOR SURE. DON'T MATTER. THAT'S WHERE I WANT TO GO, IS HOME. WHAT ABOUT YOU? WHERE'D YOU BE HEADING? I DON'T KNOW. I GOT NOWHERE TO GO. ( door opens ) WHO ARE YOU? Monroe: WHAT DO YOU WANT? THERE'S A BOAT AT THE END OF THE RAMP. OARS IS UNDERNEATH. ROW IT DOWN TO THE END OF THE LAKE, HIDE THERE. COME DAWN, YOU'LL SEE A FOOT PATH HEADING NORTH. WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS, MISTER? DON'T ASK NO QUESTIONS. I ASKED YOU WHY. YOU SETTING US UP? ANSWER ME!

IS THAT WHAT YOU EXPECT ME TO BELIEVE? WE SHOULDN'T HAVE LEFT THEM ALONE. I'LL TAKE CARE OF THIS. I WAS ASLEEP. YEAH? AND I WAS WALKING ON MOONBEAMS. YOUR CABIN IS NOT 50 FEET AWAY FROM HERE. ARE YOU TELLING ME YOU DIDN'T SEE NOR HEAR NOTHING? MAYBE HIS DOG HEARD. YOU HEAR ANYTHING, DOG? HUH? MAYBE THIS DOG DON'T HEAR. YOU THINK HE COULD HEAR A SHOTGUN SHOOT HIS BRAINS OUT? LET THE DOG BE. CAN YOUR DOG HEAR ME COUNT TO THREE? ONE... TWO... Sheriff Doyle: THIS A NEW KIND OF GAME? I SURE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THE RULES. LEROY, WE HAD THEM CAPTURED. WE HAD THEM TIED UP RIGHT IN THERE. AND HE CUT THEM LOOSE. COME HERE, LOOK AT THIS. LOOK HERE. EVEN IN SCHOOL, FLOYD, YOU COULDN'T DO ANYTHING RIGHT. THAT SHOULD GUARANTEE A GOLD STAR IN STATE POLITICS. FRED, BRING THOSE DOGS IN. DOG MAN! WHEN YOU TIED THEM UP, WERE THEY STILL CHAINED TOGETHER? WELL, OF COURSE. NOT ONLY THAT, WE CUT ALL THE POWER TO THE SAWS AND THE DRILLS, AND WE TOOK THE BOLT CUTTERS. THEY'RE STILL CHAINED TOGETHER. HOLD IT, WILLIE. TURN 'EM UP, TURN 'EM UP. COME ON, TURN 'EM UP. WILLIE, COME ON. WE GOT 'EM NOW, COME ON. COME ON, NOW. WORK IT, NOW. THAT'S A BOY. Mason: THEY'RE LONG GONE BY NOW. LEROY, THERE'S A RAILROAD TRACK NOT FIVE MILES FROM HERE. FREIGHT TRAIN COMES THROUGH AT NOON EVERY DAY. I'LL LAY ANYTHING THAT'S WHERE THEY'RE HEADED. SHOULD WE CALL IN THE CHOPPER? NOTIFY THE RAILROAD? NO. ARE YOU CRAZY? YOU'RE GOING TO LET THEM ESCAPE. THEY WON'T ESCAPE, BUT I'M GOING TO CATCH THEM MY WAY. COME ON, FLOYD. I'LL TEACH YOU HOW TO RUN FOR A TRAIN. IF YOU'RE WRONG, THAT TRAIN'S NOT THERE, I'M GOING TO KILL YOU. YOU WON'T HAVE TO. IF IT AIN'T THERE, I'M GOING TO DIE OF A BROKEN HEART. HOLD IT RIGHT THERE. ( sighs ) HOW YOU DOING, BOY? I KNOW WHO YOU ARE. THE MAN TOLD ME AND MA WHO YOU ARE.

Clyde: GET AWAY FROM ME! GET YOUR DIRTY HANDS OFF OF ME! DON'T LET HIM PUT HIS HANDS ON ME AGAIN, MISTER. YOU LIVE FAR FROM HERE? NO. WHO'S HOME BESIDES YOU? MA, JUST ME AND MA. THAT ALL? YEAH, PA RUN OFF. YOU GOT SOMETHING HOME TO BREAK THIS CHAIN? I'M TALKING TO YOU, BOY. I DON'T KNOW. WHY DON'T WE FIND OUT? LEAD THE WAY. WHO ARE YOU? WE DON'T MEAN YOU ANY HARM, MA'AM. THEN LET GO OF THE BOY. THEY'RE THE ONES. THEY'RE THE ONES THEY'S LOOKING FOR. WE'RE JUST LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO BREAK THIS CHAIN. MY BOY CLYDE HERE, HE'S REAL GOOD AT KEEPING MEAT ON THE TABLE. HE GOES OUT WITH THAT SINGLE-SHOT .22, AND HE COMES HOME WITH POSSUMS, RABBITS, SQUIRRELS... LAST WEEK, TWO DUCKS. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME HE EVER COME HOME WITH TWO JAILBIRDS. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE HELPFUL TO US, YOU SAY IT RIGHT NOW. YOU LOOK HUNGRY. GOT SOME STEW IN THERE, SOME OF YESTERDAY'S BISCUITS. THEY'LL TURN INTO DOORSTOPS IF THEY AREN'T EATEN SOON.

STRETCH THE CHAIN TIGHT. WELL? TAKING A CHANCE, MAN, TAKING A BIG CHANCE. DON'T YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE? GOT A BIBLE IN THE HOUSE IF YOU WANT TO PRAY. JOKER, THIS GOES AGAINST EVERYTHING MY DADDY EVER TAUGHT ME... EVERYTHING. MONROE, I'VE NEVER BEEN SO HAPPY TO BE FREE OF ANYTHING IN MY WHOLE LIFE. YEAH. Dog Man: DOGS NEED WATER, LEROY. ALL RIGHT, REST THEM. HEADED RIGHT FOR THE TRAIN JUST LIKE I KNEW THEY WOULD. I NEVER THOUGHT THEY'D GET THIS FAR. YOU SOUND LIKE YOU ADMIRE THEM. MAYBE I DO A LITTLE. WELL, WHY DON'T YOU JUST COME BY THE PRISON YARD SOMETIME AND SHAKE THEM BY THE HAND. I MIGHT JUST DO THAT, ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU WON'T BE AROUND ANYMORE. NOW, LET'S GO! Dog Man: ALL RIGHT, NOW. LET'S WORK. COME ON, BOY. GET 'EM. SIT DOWN. LADY, WE GOT TO GET ON. MONROE SAID THERE'S A TRAIN THAT RUNS CLOSE BY HERE. IS THAT RIGHT? YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT... ABOUT A MILE DOWN RIVER.

DON'T YOU KNOW A CAR'S GOT TO BREATH, JUST LIKE PEOPLE? GET IN AND SEE IF IT'LL START. WHY CAN'T YOU JUST ANSWER ME? ARE YOU RUNNING TO A WOMAN? NO, NOW WOULD YOU GET IN AND SEE IF IT'LL START?
