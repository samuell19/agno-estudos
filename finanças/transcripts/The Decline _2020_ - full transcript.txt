NETFLIX PRESENTS Daphné, sweetheart, wake up. Wake up. It's time. Grab your things. Hurry up. Put on your boots. Take your bag, your coat. Come on. Hurry up, sweetie. I know you were asleep, but you need to hurry. Come on, arm in sleeve. Great. Do you have your bottle? - Yes. - Do you have your extra socks? - Yes. - Your survival kit? Yes, Dad, I have it all. Where's Raphaël? Come on, Daddy. Let's go, sweetheart. Hurry up. Go, go, go. Go, go, go. Quick, quick, quick. Come on, quickly. - Do we have everything? - Yes, I think so. Okay. Lights off? Okay. From now on, not a sound. Three, two, one. Seventeen minutes, fifty-three seconds to leave the island. That's very good. That's two minutes less than last time. That's great timing. Congratulations. But I have to warn you, Daphné, next time there will be no second chance. If you forget your turtle, we leave without it. Understood? But otherwise, you did great, you know. Well done. Well done, sweetie. Shall we go to bed? Grocery stores like the ones in Montreal are stocked for three days. That means that after three days, if the trucks haven't come, there'll be nothing left. Everyone will starve. It will be chaos. There will be fighting. Which is why I'm doing this tutorial on Mylar today. We'll learn how to... preserve food. Because that will make a difference. Because the peace we know now is hanging by a thread. Not if the government collapses, of course. Or a really intense H1N1 outbreak, or a... natural disaster. So this is a good amount. I have 44 lbs. of rice here. The next thing we need to do is remove as much oxygen as possible. You can use oxygen absorbents or foot warmers. Those work, too. And besides, if you don't use them for that, you can put them in your boots. they're great to keep your feet warm when it's cold. Put it all in the bag. It's starting. - This is when you need to hurry. - Like that. Seal it with a hot iron. Careful with your fingers. We're going to seal both ends of the bag. Put them on... Yes, exactly. Pinch hard, here. A laundry iron works just fine. Yes. All the way... Now we check our work. Is it well-closed? Yes. We'll be able to eat this rice in 20 years. Or maybe even before that. In case there's an epidemic, or if... If there's an economic crisis, or if the planet gets even warmer, people will be hungry, and we'll be ready. That's it, darling. The other one. Subscribe to my channel. If you have questions, I'll answer them. If you have comments, I'll read them. And don't forget: in order to live, we have to survive. Hi, Antoine. This is Alain. Alain Fréchette. I liked your presentation letter very much. It really moved me. Listen, I know this is very short notice, but if you like, well, one of our participants cancelled. So I have a spot for you. So if you want it, it's yours. You can call me back or simply confirm by email. It would be really great if it worked out. Bye. ...we learned that the number of climate refugees will be at its highest in 2050. The international organization says that not only is the crisis near, but that the crisis will be endemic. As for numbers, they say at least 250 million climate refugees will have to find a new house in 2050. Those vulnerable people are mostly farmers already in a precarious situation. Some wish to stay in their own country, but many of them have already started to leave their country. Government leaders have assured that the doors will be closed to these migrants and safety measures will be put in place to slow down those waves of immigration. However, other countries are open to welcome some migrants, but we don't know... How strange to finally meet in person. Get your stuff. I'll take your cell phone. Get ready. Here, this is for you. You'll need protection. Okay, it's a bumpy ride. Hold on tight. It will take a while. - All good? - All good. On the website, it's easy. But in real life, you'll see it's a whole other story. I have about 500 acres of land. It's fucking huge! It keeps the world at bay. You can take them off now. We're here. I just need to get some things, and I'll show you where to put that. Alain? Where should I put this? On the counter. I'll take care of it later, okay? Perfect. - Hey. - Hi. - I'm Anna. - Antoine, pleased to meet you. My pleasure. - David. - Antoine. This is gonna be fun, man. You can choose one of those beds. The two in the back. - Hi. François. - Antoine. - Is he the last one? - No, there's one more. Settle down, get comfortable, make yourself at home. Oh, and... these are the rules. It would be great if you could read them. And curfew at 10:30 pm. - Hi, Rachel. - Antoine. You can take that one, but I'm warning you, I snore. I hope you brought your earplugs. David. Show Sébastien where he can put his stuff. - Okay. - Hi. - David. - Sébas. Hi, I'm Antoine. Hello. Sébas. Do you smoke, Sébastien? Yes, yes, sometimes when I drink. You can't smoke in the tent. Nor in the house. This is Frank. Sébastien. - Hi. - Hello. Generally, Alain doesn't... Come closer, guys. It must have been a long road. Shit, yes. Nine hours. Come closer! I stopped halfway here. It was beautiful. I'd like to explain what a survivalist temporary autonomous zone is. A TAZ. This here is my project, my baby. I've been working on it for about a decade. You'll see other bases. But none like this one. Here I have six panels, which give me 2,600 Watts. I have a shitload of propane, fuel oil. Cordwood. Dry, because green wood won't give you any heat. And a 396-gallon generator. Where's your generator? Behind the house. With that one, I can have a freezer, a fridge, power. And the extra energy loads batteries for the evenings. Here... we have a chicken coop. Over there, a greenhouse. Both are heated. You'll see, we eat well here. My chicken tastes great. Not like that damned sick chicken you buy at the store. Further down here, I have very productive apple trees. Oh, you must have deer. You have no idea. There's no lack of meat around here. And a little further over there, I have maple trees. Every spring, I make syrup. See? For now, I make it by hand, but I plan on having a real installation. Because when everything collapses, maple syrup will be perfect for trading. Because everybody likes a little sweetness. You can use it for everything, coffee, cereal. It's comforting. These are what I call the evacuation tracks, in case I'm attacked. In the summer, I rake them and I remove anything noisy. And in the winter, I keep them completely clear. So that your attackers can't hear you moving around. Let's say I'm being chased. I made forks. This is the first one. There are 15 others just like it. Every time, you need to take the right one, otherwise it's a dead end. When you think about it, it's like a code. That's sick! At the very end, there's a container with the bare necessities. So if I'm ever under attack, I'll be able to defend myself and reclaim my land from there. Do you get the idea? Yeah, it's just like a bug-out, really. It's not "just like a bug-out," it's exactly a bug-out. - But is it static or mobile? - Static. Have you ever thought of making it mobile? You know, a moving target is way harder to shoot. Yeah, but the container is for retaking my land, not for running like a coward. Can we go see it? Look. Trust me, all right? Don't go there. It's full of nice little surprises. To be clear: those tracks aren't for strolling. So... Whose first time is this? Me. This is my first time. It's my first time here, but I've already done survival. Two weeks of hunting a year, does that count? Yeah, it helps. And you, Antoine? Is this your first training? Yeah. First training like this, yeah. I've been following Alain's videos for a while. That's good. I want to be prepared. You turn on the TV, you just know it's going to shit. Just thinking about the glaciers melting and the water rising, it's really scary. I think that's bullshit. If things go to shit, it'll be a social crisis. It'll happen much sooner than we think. Weather has nothing to do with it. - Yeah, that or an economic crash. - Exactly. It's like the government, it seems like they're organizing to... to weaken us and control us better. Like with their gun control. Shit. Don't even get me started on that. Those who want to kill people should register their weapons, not me. I... I'm not insane. Curfew. All right, good night, everyone. - Good night. - Good night. - Good night. - Good night. Don't give up! Don't give up, Sébas! Don't give up! Did you make the chard? They're really good. And they're not hard to make. I make them often. You put vinegar, spices. And they keep really long. You have your supply for the winter. My grandma taught me how to make them. - You just need to take time to do it. - Yeah. Of course, it's work, but if you do it with friends, it's fun. Everybody leaves with their pickle jar. I fucking like pickles. Hey, guys. I'd like to propose a toast. - To Alain. - No. This is really a great opportunity, and... it's a real pleasure to learn by your side. Thanks, captain. No, I want to thank you guys. Thank you for being here. Enlightened citizens like you are rare. So... if I can pass on a bit of my knowledge, it makes me happy. And seeing you apply it and passing it on, I find that really beautiful. You're beautiful, Alain. But you have to know that not everyone has your good sense. And those people, I'm telling you right now, some of them will try to steal everything you have. The Golden Horde. Yes. Those guys. That's why we have to protect each other. And take care of each other. In fact, it's critical to keep good people close. I... I wasn't always alone here. But she... She wasn't interested. She thought it was too far away. Too far away from the city, far away from everything. Too far, too intense. But when I look at all of you, I don't see those intense people. I see lucid citizens. With a... a common ideal. And when I say ideal... for it to become real, we need to work hard. All of us. Everyone together. To Alain. To the cook! To all of us. - Cheers! - Cheers! It's all good. Okay, I'll try not to hurt you too badly. Come on! Come on, push, damn it. That's the trick. Fuck! Where's my cap? On your back. - She's fucking strong. - You struggled? It's big, but weak. Are you scared? - He's scared. - No. Take a turn. Don't hurt yourselves now. Show us. The first one to put the other's shoulders to the ground. Okay. - No blows? - Only cuddles. This won't end well. You okay? Damn, that fall! Grab him by the shins! Ouch! - It didn't take long. - That's all right. Come, sit down. - Didn't have time to act, Dave? - Shut up. No biggie. It's still embarrassing. He's a proud person. I watched you with Dave, earlier. You take Krav Maga lessons? Yeah, where did you learn that? In the Army? Yeah. I see. You said your boyfriend wasn't in the country, is that because he's in the Army? Deployed. Where at? Somewhere around the world. Have you ever been deployed with him? It must be awesome. Together, on the battlefield. Protecting each other. Romantic. I don't think so, no. - Have you been to war? - Frank. What? It's interesting. Have you seen corpses? - Come on. - What? Okay. Quit it. I'm not in the Army anymore, actually. Really, why not? It's none of your business. Wow! Very impressive. Honestly, good job! You're the best team, by far! ALARM ACTIVATED ZONE 5- TRAP #4 I was hoping for this to happen. It's always more fun to show a snare if there's something in it. This is the St. Michael technique. I won't explain how a snare works. You've all seen my videos. But what you didn't know is that this is a satellite transmitter, it sends a message straight to my cell phone. That way, I'm the first one here, and I don't lose my meat. There are snares like this one all over my land. For you. I might as well tell you... it stinks a little, but it's all right. You have to stick your fingers in here, and you rip it off. It's easy. What you see here is the rumen. In here you have the bowels, and the bladder a little higher. Just tear it all out, and done. Heart, lungs, liver. All good stuff. And that's all edible, so we'll keep it. Don't get them mixed up. Rip off the tail. It doesn't seem so hard. - Have you done this before? - No. Okay, then... here you go. You do this one. We'll see if you got it right. I don't want to take anyone's place. No, no, no, it's your turn. It's nobody's place. Let's go. - Do I need my knife? - No, no, no. Look. - There's a small hole here, at the top. - Yeah. Get in there and pull it down, it's easy, you'll see. It rips off on its own. I don't know why, I'm feeling sick. You okay, Frank? Come on, let's go! You're not gonna throw up, are you? No, I'm not. Lucky it wasn't a moose, right? Fuck. Come on now, sorry. Yes, that's it. No, but seriously. Say things go wrong and a guy gets caught in your trap. What do you do? I would treat myself. You'd beat him up? I don't really know. I would decide on the spot, but it wouldn't be pretty. Wouldn't you? Beating up people for no reason isn't my thing. But there would be a reason. And you, Antoine? I'd pull him down. Threaten him, scare him, and make sure he never comes back. That's soft. Maybe he's a scout. Maybe there are others behind him, a whole gang even. Coming for him. So you finish him off. You hang him from a tree. So they can see him from far away and the message is clear. Séb? Oh, yeah, I'd kill him for sure. I'd skin him and turn him into a coat. It's true that in extraordinary circumstances... maybe you don't have a choice. Of course you have a choice. The guy's caught in your trap, you have the upper hand. You decide whether to kill him or not. Antoine's right. If it's an attack, it's easy. But that guy in your trap... maybe he's a doctor. Or an extra pair of hands to help you feed the animals. Good morning. Good morning. So? What do you think? It's awesome. Inspiring, in fact. It's not just a pipe dream. It's real. It's thought out, it feels great. It's important to me that you feel good. At peace. This is exactly what my girl and I are looking for. This is a big place. You could settle down. Move here with her. You would fit in great here. You know, it's only a question of time until shit hits the fan. And when it happens... I don't want my life to change. I want to eat my fill. I want to protect my own. And... play the piano. You can eat the orange ones, no problem. They're edible. Hey, who am I imitating? "I don't know why, I'm feeling sick." I would have liked to see you in my place. It's fine, Frank. - You just don't have a strong stomach. - Yeah. That's enough. Oh, now he's upset. No, I'm not. We're teasing you. What the hell are you doing, genius? Turn off the water, damn it! Where do you think you are, a hotel? - Sorry, I thought it was river water. - That's no reason to waste it! Okay, Alain, I got it. It's all right. Thanks. No messing around here. You need to be very careful with this stuff. Avoid friction... and static electricity. I'm serious. This is no joke. Protecting your resources and your territory... is the key to survival in times of chaos. When you have 5,000 migrants rushing into your neighborhood with 5,000 machetes, you might have 50 guns, but you won't have 50 hands to operate them. That's why a well-placed booby trap to blow up 20 of them at once, I swear that'll keep them away. They'll shit their pants once it blows in their faces. Done? Good. This won't do. You need to strip it and twist them together. That's an open circuit. If we get static electricity in here, we're all dead. That's a compact one. Good job, Anna! Well done! - Thanks. - Cool. Okay, we're done for today. Let's split. Sébastien and I will go and start cooking. The rest of you will take the gear and put it back where we took it from. All right? All right. I was doing the dishes, and what's he watching? I go to the living room, I turn on the TV, and... What the hell is that show? It's all talking animals. At some point, I would have to pause it every two minutes to explain that it's not real life. That's because cartoons make everything more mellow. Seriously, cartoons today are not as good as the ones we used to watch. Fuck! It blew up! Alain! François! Alain! Alain! He's still breathing. Stay with me! François! François? - Talk to him! - Frank! François, stay with me. Go get an ambulance! Call an ambulance! Frank! - Come on! Go get Alain! - Alain! Alain... Damn it! - François? Talk to him. - Alain! - Frank! Frank! - Alain! Talk to him! - Frank, don't give up, Frank! - Alain! Alain! Where the fuck is he? Alain! Help us, Dave! Shit! François, stay with us! François! Frank! - Shit! - François! He's not breathing anymore, I have no pulse. We have to take him inside. Let's take him inside. Fuck. Take his legs. David! Wake up! Help us! David! David, go open the door! Dave! Open the door, Dave! Damn it! Dave! Why don't we say that... that it was a hunting accident. Look at the fucking body. It's clearly not a hunting accident. Okay, but what shall we do? We can't leave him like that. Oh, shit, we're in trouble. - Oh, shit, we're in trouble. - No, no. It was an accident. Nobody here is responsible. Yeah, nobody meant for this to happen. We're calling an ambulance. What do you think they'll do? Take away a guy with a blown-up chest who's been dead for hours and ask no questions? They'll call the police. And then the fucking police will come to my place. Well, then... they'll realize it was an accident. You're so fucking naive. When they get here and see the equipment, the guns, do you really think they won't say anything? We'll all go to jail for manslaughter and domestic terrorism. Well, what do you want us to do? What we have to do... is bury him and keep our mouths shut. - What? - Are you insane? - Say what? - We're not burying him. Do you really want to go to prison because of that moron? First, he's not a moron. Second, what don't you understand about "it was an accident"? It was his fault! We're not going to jail because of him! What's clear is that if we call someone from the outside, we're done. Antoine. How will you explain to your daughter that you can't see her anymore because you're in jail? Because that's exactly what's going to happen if you go to the police, man. Of course not! Fuck, guys! We're not going to jail! Nobody here is going to jail, we were all witnesses. It was an accident! His wife! I mean, he has a family! She'll end up realizing something's wrong at some point, and she'll report it. What about his stuff? Buried, with him. - And we take his car apart. - No! No, what... Alain, we're not burying him! We're calling the police! I mean, accidents they... they happen. That doesn't make us murderers. You're so dense! You don't get it! We'll get arrested straight away. - That's what's going to happen. - Okay. This needs to stop. - Where's my phone? - In a safe place, and it's staying there. Give me my fucking phone! I wasn't asking you for your opinion. Give me my phone, Alain. That's enough! I've been watching you ramble for long enough. Let me remind you of a few things: François is dead, and nothing that will be said in this room will change anything about that. What's happening now, what's happening to us, that's exactly what we're getting ready for! There's a crisis, now we need to deal with it. We need to keep a cool head, but that's not what you're doing right now! You're all over the damn place! We're all tired right now. So... we'll sleep on it. And tomorrow morning, we'll decide what to do. Is that understood? Agreed? Agreed. Go to bed, now. We're all out of it, anyway. Okay, we need to calm down. Did you hear me, Antoine? Are you okay, Antoine? Yeah. Good night. I know burying the body sounds like a solution, but it'll only push back the consequences. His wife will end up filing a missing person report. With the cameras on the road, they'll end up tracking down his licence plate. Yeah, and they'll track his phone. The cops will show up here. We'll have a hidden corpse. We'll be in big trouble. And we'll go to prison. At this point, I think we're going to jail no matter what happens. No, he's the one in trouble, not us. Yes, it's his supplies, his land, his idea. Yeah, but we were the ones shooting guns and making the fucking bombs. Hey, we all have our firearm licenses. We'll be fine. We're legal. The guy organizes trainings, and he's not even able to ensure everyone's safety. He's the one in trouble, not us. Yes... I... I understand. But... it's not that simple. We have to call the police. We need to find Alain's phone. What the hell is that? Fuck! Fuck, Alain! We told you not to! You had no right to do this! - Psycho! - Are you okay? I'm getting the hell out of here. Are you okay? I'm leaving. Look. You're thinking with your emotions. Where did your good sense go? For fuck's sake, Alain! We were supposed to find a solution to this. A solution to what? A solution to ruin everything? Look. Drop your stuff and stay here. There's been enough trouble. We just need to discuss this calmly. I'm getting the hell out of here. Take us back to our cars! Get out of my way! David... David... David, put your gun down, all right? They're all against you, Alain. They wanted to take your phone. They want to call the police and blame everything on you. Are you going to let him shoot us? Are you, Alain? Because that won't be an accident anymore, Alain. You stay here! Do you fucking hear me? You stay right here! You will destroy everything we built. Do you hear me, damn it? Shit! It's time now, let's go! Let's go, let's go! Guys! Guys, stop! No, Dave, help me! Guys, stop, we can't leave her here! Come on, let's go! It's only a small bullet in the leg, sweetheart. It's nothing. I'm sorry. This isn't what I wanted! Let me go! Alain, they ran to the tracks. Look, they won't go far, we'll find them. Okay. Let's get her out of here, we need to take her inside, okay? Let me go! Let me... Let me go. We're trying to help you, here. Untie me. Untie me. I have no choice. This is going to hurt. Stop, stop, stop. - Untie me. - I have to go. I have to go get the others in the woods. Otherwise, they'll get lost. - I beg you, untie me. - I'll be back. Relax. I'm not a murderer, but that doesn't mean I won't protect what's mine. Untie me! No, stay! Stay! Fuck. Shit. David, we're not playing war, here. This, here... This... It's only to make sure we're understood. - Okay? - It's okay. He's dead. He's a fucking psycho. He knows we're here. We have to leave the trail. Come on. We're all gonna die here. Walk. Shit. Alain? Alain, they came through here. Antoine? We're back on the trail. Careful. Look over there. It's his bug-out. - Give it to me. - Here. Fuck. Okay, wait. Help me. One, two, three. One more time. One more time. One, two, three. - There's a GPS. - Yes. Dave, go around. We're too late. They took some gear. Guns. Shit. This changes everything. We have to find them. We'll have to defend ourselves as well. I don't want another death on my land. Okay? They took guns. We have guns. There won't be any talking. If they get the fuck out of here, they're gonna get the cops. That means goodbye house, goodbye land, goodbye everything. You know the solution. They can't be far. - Do you see anything? - No, nothing. They must have run through the tracks. Let's move. I'm pretty sure this is the river we crossed when we got here. It's thick. We'll be very exposed. I know, but we don't have a choice. We'll have to be quick. Come on, I'll cover you. Trust me. Go. No! Rachel! Do some contraction. Contract your legs. Go. Move, like it. Come on. Move your body. Come on, come on. Big movements. Come on, come on, come on. Big movements, come on. Shit, it... It's not working. We have to move. Are you okay? Do you want this? You okay? Yeah, I'm okay. And... Thank you. My pleasure, really. I wouldn't have left you there. You could have hesitated. You never know how you'll react in those situations. Honestly, I didn't have much time to think. That's good. That's what you should do. I hesitated once, and... some people died. Is that why you quit? I couldn't do it anymore. In the field, when you start getting scared... it's tough to control. I'm sure. Could you check if we're still far? That way. Shit! We can stop this right now. This has all gone way too far. Rachel, leave me here. They won't believe you. They'll arrest you as well. But when I look at all of you, I see lucid citizens. With a... a common ideal. And when I say ideal... for it to become real, we need to work hard. All of us. Everyone together. To Alain. To all of us. - Cheers! - Cheers!
