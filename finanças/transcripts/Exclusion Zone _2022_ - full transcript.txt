Sir, are you seeing this? Yeah, many times Do you think it could be a shield of?some kind? We don't know... Are you ready? Jason?! Sorry, yea Packed and ready I got my swim short and sun cream Remember, this is not a search and rescue mission you're only to report back what you see inside. Got it. You saying they're not predatory? Nothing is certain right now. Great. and what if I find Dr. Watson? We don't want any thing or anybody coming back out except you is that understood? Loud and clear. Okay. You may?proceed and er, good luck. Okay, time out. I come in peace I'm not carrying any weapons assuming you speak English? Yep, they're definitely predatory You're right. What? Did you expect some green little man? So... so you're not... No. If I was you'd be dead by now Then why did you stab me? I had to be sure. Sorry. What do you mean? I'll explain later but first you can take that mask off the air is safe. Wait a minute There weren't any structures on the map A lot has changed since their arrival Like since yesterday? You hungry? Strangely so starving So what's your name? Alice, you? Jason. So you're like a resident of the area? Most of them died a long time ago. Right. And do you know where I can find a Dr. Watson? He um he came in yesterday. Thanks. Look, I know you have a lot of questions so I'll just start with the basics. Inside the zone, time moves a lot faster. a day out there is 30?years in here What? When you come from the outside Your body takes a while to adjust, hence the dehydration and the hunger it's trying to catch up there's only one way to know if you're?not one of them they don't bleed So... what's your mission? I'm just supposed to observe and report back But, I was kind of hoping to find the doctor too. Good luck with that Let me take a look at that So what's been happening here then? There's not many of us left so I think they're trying to use this time they have here to plan. For what? Attack Do you have a gun? They can't be killed by objects only human flesh. That's... that's weird. What do you want? Alice, it's me. Ollie, remember? I see you have company. Prove it. Come on. So how many of them did you say? Not sure, at least two I think. I don't think we'll be safe here anymore and if they're tracking you. They appear just like us? Yeah. Same memories, same personality. If they have a ship maybe we can get on board and blow it up. God, you watch too many movies. They don't have a ship. I mean, we've searched every inch of this place. But if... No, it's not invisible. We've seen how they arrive. How? Let's get some sleep. I mean, we'll need the energy for tomorrow. You'll be on first watch? Yea. Jesus Christ. Creep on me like that. Listen man She's not who she says she is. What do you mean? I've been following her over the last few days She killed a few of my men. She seems... er.. I mean... she... you sure? Don't let her human cover fool you. Have you ever seen her bleed? No. Exactly. There's more than one way to tell if they're human Alright Alice, couldn't sleep I'm just having a drink with your new friend. Look at the way she walks What are you looking at? Er, nothing... just... You gotta do what you gotta do. Why can't we both go? I gotta stay out here in case the others come Yea, good point. Good luck. So everybody keeps telling me. It's done. Good. Shh... Shh... Shh... We got ourselves a little situation What? Ollie is our little green man But he's... He had no scar. You gotta do what you gotta?do. No, with your hands! Okay. We gotta leave. More of them get sent when one dies or gets injured Please. can we just go and find Dr. Watson? I'm sure he's gonna?know a lot more than us. Dr. Watson is dead. How do you know? Because I'm his daughter.
