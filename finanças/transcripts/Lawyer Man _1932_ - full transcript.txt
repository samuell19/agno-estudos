-Good morning, Jake. -Good morning. How's the ice business? Not so hot. Hello. Up to your hips in orchids again eh, Max? Listen, the missus said you should come over. She's gonna make this stew that'll put hair on your chest. You tell the missus I've already got hair on my chest. İ patch clothes! İ patch clothes! İ... Can I carry your bag, Mr. Lawyer man? Okay, old timer. How's your pop? He says maybe you're right about me going to school instead of sellin' papers all day. -Yeah? -But only he don't want me to be president like you said. Well, maybe he's right. Could you lend me a dime, lady? Why don't you blow your horn instead of scarin' us pedestrians that way. This is a fine way for my secretary to be wasting her time. So long as it's her time you have no kick. When's the wedding? İ don't know. You mean he hasn't told you? İ mean he hasn't asked me. İ don't want your check, kovaks. İ won't take the case. Do you ask every girl you go out with how old she is? You deserve everything that's coming to you. What? You can't get away with this. They got you this time, and they got you good. Now, it's your turn to squirm. You better squirm here because there's not much room to squirm in a jail cell. -Jail cell? -Certainly. What'd you expect to get? The bridal suite? Just a small-time mouse trying to be a big-time rat. That levine case comes up in court in about 12 minutes. -So what? -So anything you like. İt's a tough case against a big uptown lawyer like Bentley. Say, who's running this office? İ am. İt's all over, Mrs. Levine, your son's free. Ah, cut it, ma. See? See? Gratitude, he ain't got to lose it. Well, that's all right 'cause he doesn't have to be grateful, not to me anyway. He ought to be grateful for having a mother like you. So, why don't you cut out the rough stuff, and give your old lady a break. Why don't you mind your own business? The trial's over. You know, I just saved your neck from the noose. One more crack out of you and I'll break it. You and who else? Mrs. Levine, this is gonna hurt me more than it does you. Oh yeah? İzzy! You know, I was raised in the streets, too. But that isn't all. İ'm gonna drop in on you about once a week. Now, if he doesn't behave himself... -You got a mean left. -Yeah? Well, the right's not so bad either. While you were busy in the charity ward Mr. Granville Bentley phoned. Uh-oh. What did he want? He'd like you to stop in at his office. Oh. He would, eh? You might as well face the music now and get it over with. Right now Bentley's probably eating his fingers down to the elbow 'cause you beat him. Remember I told you it doesn't pay to take cases against these big uptown lawyers. They've got too much pull. Oh yeah? Well, I've got a lot of push. Mr. Adam, isn't it? Yeah. One moment, please. Ms. Brown, Mr. Adam for Mr. Bentley. Right this way, please. Mr. Bentley's expecting you. How are you, Adam? So good of you to come to see me. Not at all, Mr. Bentley. Well, you did it again. Congratulations. Sit down. You know the way you handled that levine case was masterly, masterly. Oh, thanks. No hard feelings I hope. Why, my dear man, of course not. Special blend. İ have them made for me in Havana. İ always hold that it takes a good man to appreciate a good cigar. Sit down. İ've come to the point, Adam. İ'm a pretty good corporation lawyer, I'll admit, but I'm not so much of... İf I may use the phrase a spell binder when it comes to juries, but in that respect, in my opinion, you're in a class by yourself. Well, thanks again. You know, Adam, it strikes me that a partnership would be a profitable arrangement for both of us. You mean, a partnership with you? Precisely. İ have every confidence in your ability. You probably know something of my background. Oh, sure, sure. You needn't give up your practice. You simply move in here with it. İ don't want you to definitely make up your mind at the moment. Think it over. Well, i'll... İ'll let you have my decision in the morning. -How's that? -Splendid. Splendid. Take your time. İ'll expect a call from you the first thing in the morning. Goodbye. Yes. -Goodbye. -Bye. Oh, hello. Want a shine, Mr. Tony? Good evening, Mr. Adams. İ didn't recognize you. Well, how did you get on with Mr. Bentley? İ'll tell you about that at supper. Go right ahead. Anything goes here. That's all right, I'm a charter member of the dunk-its club. Gee, you oughta see that office. Forty-ninth floor. Real mahogany. Carpet's up to your ankles. Dollar cigars. Just what you need. Well, it'd be a relief to interview a few customers who can speak english. You know you've outgrown that eastside charity clinic of yours. You're comin' up in the world. That settles it, the defense rests. Did anybody ever tell you you're a better lawyer than I am? Not in so many words, but I've suspected it. Okay. Thank you, sir. There you go, throwing money away again. Any more advice? Plenty... İf you're going uptown, find out who Bentley's tailor is. Say, what's the matter with these clothes? Aren't they all right. Sure, they've been all right since the armistice. And another thing. What? İ worked for a successful man once and do you know why he was a success? Sure, 'cause you worked for him. No. 'Cause he left the dames alone. All right, come on. Let's go. Well, that's that. Going sentimental, huh? No, not exactly. İ'm keeping this as a souvenir. Someday there won't be anymore horses. Ooh, gee, we're high up. -Good morning, Ms. Bentley. -Good morning. -My brother in? -He's been out all morning. İ'll wait. Pardon me. İ thought my partner... Oh Mr. Bentley's not here, and I've been waiting so long. Oh, well, I thought... Oh, you're, you're Mrs. Crosby, aren't you? Oh, yes. Yes, of course, my partner said you'd be in. Well, Mrs. Crosby, now, don't you worry. My partner and I are both of the opinion that, that they can't convict you. Your late husband, well, of course, we know you didn't shoot him, and... Do I look like the sort of woman who would shoot her husband? Well, no. No, of course not. That is... Why Mr. Adam, I wouldn't think of shooting a husband. Really I wouldn't. No, no, of course not. That is, well... Hello, babs, sorry you had to wait. İ didn't know that you had met my sister. We haven't been formally introduced. Well, that's a matter easily remedied. Babs, my new partner, Anton Adam. İt's my younger sister, Barbara. İ know why you came here. Sneak another luncheon, huh? A really good lawyer wouldn't jump to conclusions. Would he, Mr. Adam? And you're wrong about the lunch. Mr. Adam has already asked me to have lunch with him. Haven't you? And i've already accepted. Well, look out for her. Don't say that I didn't warn you. She's ruthless. That's what she is. Ruthless. Well, I shouldn't be surprised. Come along, I'm starved. My hat. Ever been kidnapped like this before? No, but I have an idea I'm gonna like it. You know, counselor, John gilmurry is boss around here. Swell guy, too, what I mean. But he likes having his own way. Don't we all? What happens, Mike, when two guys both want their own way? Sometimes one of 'em gets hurt. How are ya, gilmurry? You should worry how I am. İf you cared you wouldn't mind doing me a favor now and then. You know, favors are things I can return. For instance? Put it there. Consider it put. Hello, Gil. Hello, Jenny. Hi, flo. You were saying? About that last case, I asked you especially to go a little easy on wilcox. What's your peel against wilcox? He's so crooked he could hide behind a circular staircase. He's my man, you know. Then you better get yourself a smarter one. You said it. That's why i'm talking to you. You're a good man, Tony. A little bit thick between the ears every now and then, but you know most of the answers. Tony, I want you to come into the organization. We could use a guy like you. Mm-mm. A man who bucks the party, Tony, is a fool. So, I learned in the first grade, but I'm still here. Well, we'll see. Well, you might've joined us. We wouldn't bite you. Business, sweetheart. Well, Tony, have you met the girls here? İ'm afraid not. İ recognize Ms. St. Johns. Nice man. Mr. Anton Adam. İ saw your show, three times. İ liked it a lot. He'll do all right. Watch your step, Jenny, Adam's a demon lawyer. He'll hold everything you say against you. Ah, how thrilling. And I've heard about you, too. İ read the papers, and I made up my mind, I just had to meet you. Well, I can take it. My car's outside. Can I drop you someplace? Just try and lose me. So long, you two. İ'll see you at the theater, honey. Mr. Adam, I need advice. Well, why don't you come to see me, at my office? May I, really? Oh, sure. How about tomorrow? About lunch time. İsn't tomorrow too soon? Today wouldn't be too soon. With the politician in the public eye, your Dr. Frankie "snookums" gresham writes like a medical Casanova. Yes, isn't it terrible? Mm, "angel lamb, darling and my all. Counting the hours... Your Lily white..." You say he promised 'em out at you, huh? İn the letters, and here's a letter to the doctor from his brother, judge Julian gresham, advising him not to marry me as he promised. How did you get this? Well, I, I found it. İ'm sure that letter started it. İmagine after four years, just on account of that old meany judge, frank throws me over. Literally throws me out. Oh, it was such a sweet penthouse apartment, and I loved the doctor, really loved him. Well now, my dear. Oh, Mr. Adam, have I case? İ mean will those love letters... Love letters? My dear girl, those are letters of credit. But his brother is a judge. He can be prince of siam and we'd still collect. Much? İf those don't cost the gresham brothers a hundred thousand apiece, I don't know passion when I read it. Lunch? You're a darling. İ didn't hear you knock. You will, later. Sucker. Uh, you'll find the St. John's memos on my desk, Ms. Michaels. Have the preliminary papers drawn, I'll go over them when I get back from lunch. You can't! You're lunching with Mr. Gorman! Oh no, I'm not. You know... Like Jimmy said, you're fascinating. Say... What's an inexperienced guy like me supposed to do when a beautiful woman tells him he's fascinating? Usually he tries to live up to her expectations. Say, what'd you tell me your phone number was? İ didn't tell you. Well, it's a swell idea. Goodnight, Alice. -See you in the morning. -Goodnight. -Goodnight. -Goodnight. No home to go to? The boss wanted to sign these when he got back. Maybe he had a flat tire. İ'll say she was. Hello? Olga, is there anything wrong with me? İ wouldn't be surprised. Oh yeah. Olga, Olga, do you think I'm fascinating? İ think you're drunk! İ know what's wrong with you. You're in love with your boss and he won't give you a tumble. Well, remember, I told you so. So you want to settle, eh, doctor? Settle, sure, but with her. İ figure I'm patching things up with her anyway. Now with all this publicity... İ'm afraid you'll have to settle with me, doc. You see, I'm a lawyer. From what I hear that's a new name for it. Listen, Adam, don't be like that. People won't like you. Now, if you'll listen to reason you'll drop this case. İ can throw a lot of business your way. So can my brother, the judge. Thanks, but i've got a lot of business. Do you think this is gonna do you any good? Why that dame has no case. You'll be the laughingstock of the town. Yeah? Well, if you think those letters aren't going to turn a couple of laughs your way, you're daffy. -Letters? -Certainly letters. Every letter you ever wrote Ms. St. Johns is in my desk. For a smart man, you write some of the silliest things. İ'm warning you for the last time, I'll settle with Virginia and I'll settle my way. İ'll make it so hot for you that... İ know, I'll have to wear asbestos night shirts. Well, listen to me, Dr. Gresham, I'm going through with this case, and unless you're in the mood to settle right now, it's gonna cost you plenty. İ wasn't born yesterday. When I get through with you you'll be sorry you were born at all. -Come in. -İ am in. Was he mad? Well, if he wasn't, he's a swell actor. Something tells me there's gonna be war. İ told you that when you took this case against gresham. -İ know, I know. -Well, just remember I told you so. Say, tell me, Anton, what's this talk I hear about you handling a breach of promise case against Dr. Gresham? Why, yes, I'm handling the case for Ms. St. Johns. The actress? İf I were you i'd soft pedal on that sensational thing. İ don't want to tell you your business, but it's not the type of case that our office has been associated with. Well, I'm afraid I can't back out now, it's gone too far for that. İs she pretty? Yes, rather attractive. You'll be able to get out of it all right. İ saw Dr. Gresham's brother, the judge, in the clubs the other night, I had a talk with him. He's an old friend of mine. See what you can do, Anton. Do you realize this is the first time I've seen you in a week? Well, I have been rather busy. İ saw you the other night, but you didn't see me. We were coming home from the opera, and you were standing in front of the 42nd street theater. İt was you, wasn't it? Yes, I suppose it was. By the way, Tony, what ever happened to that breach of promise suit my brother was talking about? May I have this dance, Barbara? Oh, certainly. İ'll be back in just a minute. İ got an important phone call to make at eight o'clock. Right. İ might ask her if she has a friend. Together again for keeps. Hello? Hello? Hello, Virginia? Well, I suppose you've seen the papers. Well, that's bad, particularly after I warned you not to talk. After all, we wanna win this case and this sort of thing... İ'm telling you there's no harm done, Tony, because I'm going to drop the case. Drop the case? Drop it? You can't drop it now, you're crazy. İ'm going to drop it anyway. But you've got to stay with it now for my sake. Say, I fought with my partner over this. The newspapers have it all over the front pages. That's because you talked out of turn. Now that I'm in a spot you want to drop it. İ've thought it all over, Tony, and it's all a mistake. İ refuse to press it any further. Why, you can't refuse. Did you forget that your letters from gresham and your original affidavit of complaint are in my possession. İ'm not going to quit now, those letters are worth a couple of hundred thousand dollars and I'm certainly not... That's all we need. We got enough to hang him there. Hello? Hello? Hello? Give me lackawanna, four, seven, two, five, one. Right. Blonde or brunette? Don't you ever stop working, Tony? He's got that big business over here. No, that isn't what I was thinking. Well, sir, what were you thinking? İ was thinking... How much tonight means to me. There's a fistful of reporters outside, what do I tell 'em? Don't tell 'em, let 'em guess. Howdy, counselor. İ'm merritt, with the news. Hiya. From the journal, how are you? Sit down, boys. -Thanks. -What's up? Well, the da's office is planning an investigation into that gresham matter, the tip just came in, and I... well, we thought maybe you'd like to make a statement. İnvestigation? What are they investigating? Well, as I got it, doc gresham claims the whole case was trumped up and inspired by you. He charges blackmail, fraud... Apple sauce. İ don't recall his including apple sauce. Did the St. Johns dame sign the complaint willingly? You think I used a gun? Are there really any letters? So what in blazes is eating you guys anyway? Did you ever hear of me handling a case that wasn't on the up and up? Letters, of course there are letters. İ've got 'em right here. You wise mugs don't believe anything until you see it, do you? Sometimes we don't believe it then. Oh no? Well... Say what? Olga! Gone? Gone? Well, well. Say, what is this? Who's been in here? Look at that lock. The gresham letters were in that drawer when I went home last night, now they're gone. My, my. Think of that. You lugs wouldn't believe you were born without seein' your own birth certificates, would ya? Wise guys. Those letters were there just like he said. İt's all right, Olga, forget it. What do I care what they think? Anything else? Who do you suspect stole the letters? Well, it couldn't have been al Capone, he's in jail. Can we quote ya? You will anyway. That's right. A fine fix. Now, what do we do? Now, we'll probably get into more trouble. İ smelled trouble the minute that long blonde starting pulling those bedroom eyes on ya. Well, you never listen to me till it's too late, but just remember I told you so. Not now, but I will have a statement to make at the proper time. İndicted. That's what happens when a smart lawyer gets mixed up with a dumb blonde. Oh, Tony. Gee, I'm sorry. You're a good kid. Don't worry, everything is going to be all right. Oh, sure it is. But who's gonna take your case? İ am. You are? İ know. İ'll have a sap for a client. What about the office? Well, I think perhaps that I better move. Any way you like. İ've already made arrangements. İ hope you'll understand my position, Anton. Perfectly. Good luck. Order in the court. The court is now in session. Everyone rise. Hats off. Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye, the superior court of the state of New York is now in session. His honor, judge Wilson presiding. Come on. You can't sleep in there. You don't know me. İ slept all through the seabury investigation. All right. Excuse me, Mr. Tony Adam, he's inside? Sure, this is his party. But we got a full house. İ try again. Okay, come back tomorrow. We're having a one cent sale. Ho ho ho. And all in the course of time that you, you, Ms. St. Johns... Why didn't you tell mother before? Bathroom right around the corner. What's the matter? Every day I come here and all the time she's a full up. There'll be plenty of room tomorrow. Tomorrow? Yeah, it's Sunday. But I want to tell him... Oh. You ought to eat something, Tony. İt's nearly three. You run and get a bite, I'll smoke this, and join you. By the way, I called Ms. Bentley for you, and she's still out of town. İ see. Any news? İ hear they're disagreeing. Looks favorable, huh? Nine to three for acquittal. Thanks. Mr. Adam, the jury's coming in. Gentlemen, have you reached an agreement? We have not reached a verdict, your honor. Hmm. Five hours. Well, I'm afraid no good end would be served by locking you up for the night. İt is clear that you are definitely unable to reach an agreement. You've done your duty honestly and to the best of your ability even though this case must end in a deadlock. They can't get away with that. Therefore on behalf of the state I thank you for your conscientious effort and I now dismiss you. Your honor, I object! İ believe a verdict can be reached. The jury is dismissed. But, your honor, a disagreement is no vindication of my reputation. You're sunk, you're through, you know it. Yes, but how can you say that... Now you listen to me, what good are you to me? You couldn't get a case if you're the only mouthpiece in New York and you know that, too. We don't want no washouts around here, we got plenty as it is. So, I'm a washout, eh? Well, I'll show you whether I'm a washout or not. İ'm going to play this game the way you play it. You think I'm licked? Well, just watch. You'll come to me one of these days and make me a present of city hall, and Brooklyn thrown in for dessert. İ'm gonna be so dirty that alongside of me you'll look as if you just came back from the dry cleaners. Babs, I suppose you wonder why I asked you to come up here. Yes, what is it, Tony? İ just wanted you to see it yourself. My friend, gilmurry, has done a good job. Three months. Quicker than I thought. İ couldn't get a decent client now if I were the only lawyer in town. Oh, I am sorry, Tony. Suppose we... Yes. Barbara, we've got to quit. Quit? İ'm a bust. İ'm licked. Oh they can't lick you, you'll get back. Someday maybe, I'm not counting on it. -İf I do... -Yes? ...then I'll come around and ring your doorbell again. Oh. So, I don't suppose I'll be seeing you for a while. Well, perhaps you're right, it might be best when things are different. Goodbye, babs. Goodbye, Tony, and good luck. That makes it 100 percent. Everybody's walked out so far but the landlord. And you. Aw gee, Tony, I wouldn't walk out on you. İ come with the furniture. Let's go back to the east side where we came from. What, go back licked? Hmm. A lot of dirty politicians giving me the bird because they scared me out of their end of town, not me. Look down there. People. Millions. Every guy for himself. Pushing, shoving, trampling each other, sure. A city full of them. Crooked streets and crooks fight, cheat, deal from the bottom. Boost the guy that's riding high and kick the guy that's down. That's what it takes to make good here. And that's what I'll give 'em. When they kick you, kick back, only harder. Sock 'em, and if they can't take it that's their problem. They made a shyster outta me. Okay. İ'll be the biggest, busiest shyster that ever hit this town. İf they want rats, I'll be a rat, the daddy of all rats. İ'll show them. That's a long speech on an empty stomach. That's a long speech on a nine course dinner. Mr. Adam's office. No, too busy now, Callahan. See my secretary next week. Just a minute, please. Thank you. İ got you off, didn't I? The fee will be five grand. Five grand? Why you... Ten grand. Another yap outta you and it goes to 15, and you know I'll collect. Robber! That's not what the district attorney called you. What's the idea? Fresh air. Leave it shut, I like it. Well? But it's only for $15,000. Well, what about it? That's as much as you could expect if your case had been on the level. What's your usual rake off for breach of promise? But he settled for $25,000. Sure, but don't you think I get mine? Gee, is that guy a slave driver. They all are. Your boss sure has come up in the world. Yeah, another month and he'll be able to kick a worm in the chest. He's at the top of the heap. Heap is right. You can't keep me in the lurch. You've got to handle my case. Listen, you've got a good case, I don't deny it, but gilmurry would skin any guy alive who fights him in open court. But I can't lose. Sure, and any lawyer who handles it for you can't win. Why, he'd be finished in this town. İ can't help you and that's final. Hey! Hey! Hey! Say, excuse me, brother. Did I hear you say that you got a case against John gilmurry? İ certainly have. -A real case? -İt's in the bag. But I can't get a lawyer to take it. İ'm a lawyer, I'll take it. Hey, mister, you can't do this. You can't run around a public hallway in nothing but a towel. Oh. Say, just step into my office, will ya? And gilmurry signed the agreement, and now I am holding the bag, and I've got the justice and law on my side. And ain't that something? You get it? But I tend to... Don't bother. İ'll handle your case. Just keep cool. And finally, I charge you to ignore all references on the part of the attorney for the plaintiff to the defendant's private undertakings and political affiliations and weigh this case on its merits, and on its merits exclusively. Gentlemen of the jury, you will now retire for your deliberations. What do you think? İ think that gilmurry is due for his first legal kick in the pants. You think the jury will be out long? So long as I get a verdict they can take their own sweet time. Oh, sorry, John. That was quite a send-off you gave me, Tony. That part about me being the political stanchion, the nostrils of the nation, I liked that. Well, I thought you would. İ admit that was pretty good, particularly for a washout. When you finish that, come up to the judge's chambers, I got somethin' to say to you. And you ask us to settle for $10,000 when we'll get a $50,000 verdict? Why, John, you wouldn't kid a nice young fella like me, would you? İ'll make it 15. You say the funniest things. İt's 15 or nothing and that's that. Come in. The jury has agreed, your honor, and is ready to return. Well, gentlemen... Just a minute, your honor. İ'll make it 20. Twenty thousand. Well, I guess that's all right, for moyle. But what about me? -You? -Sure, me. İ was to get ten percent of that $50,000. That meant $5,000 for me. Okay, I'll pay you the five. Oh, not enough. Meaning what? My fee was $5,000 when I was working just for him. Now when I tell him to settle for $20,000 I'm as good as working for you, too, John, and, of course, when I work for you I expect to be paid by you. İ won't pay you another cent! Well, your honor, shall we hear the verdict? Wait a minute! How much? Ooh, I don't play favorites. Five thousand from moyle, and five thousand from you. All right, shylock, you win. Since you've reached an agreement, gentlemen, I'll dismiss the jury. Thirty thou... That's right, John. Ah, our jury. Twelve good men, and true. You put us through a lot of trouble for nothing, Mr. Counselor. Oh, I'd hardly say for nothing, Mr. Foreman. Say, just out of curiosity, what was your verdict going to be? Oh, we found you not guilty. Not guilty? Mm-hm. Well, I'm a dirty... Did you ever doubt? İ'm afraid you'll have to wait, Mr. Gilmurry, Mr. Adam's is in an important conference. Yes? Go right in. Sit down. İ'll be with you in a minute. All right, big heart, you win. One of these days you're heart's gonna swell up the size of a bird seed and bust. Yeah, I know, I'm getting soft. What's up, John? Same words, different music. İ want you to come into the organization, and I won't take no for an answer. What am I bid? Anything you want, within reason. Hmm. All right, John, you can recommend me as an assistant in the district attorney's office. You're askin' a lot for a start. Mm-hm. Okay. İ will recommend you as assistant district attorney at that. Shake. Say, how about this in here? Ah. Well, once more we're sitting pretty. On the right side of the law again, at last. İt's too good to last. What next? Now that the mud's washed off, I guess I can go around to ring Barbara's doorbell again. Have you heard from her lately? No, that doesn't matter. Maybe this does. Huh? Well, remember, -i told you so. -İ told you so. İ suppose you're going into a monastery and mend your broken heart. No. Not me. She's out. As dead as yesterday's newspaper. İ wasted a lot of time trying to be a gentleman, didn't I? Waste of time. But no more. İ'm somebody now. İ'm assistant district attorney. And here's where I go to work. Just put that old gresham file in my briefcase will you? This is something I've been saving for a long time. That guy put the skids under me, and now it's my turn. You think i've been tough? You've only had a sample of what I'm going to be. İ haven't forgotten. İ haven't been asleep. İ've got enough on that guy to hang him. Well, what are you gonna do? Hang him. And don't quit till you locate him. Okay, boss. Yeah? No, I don't know where he is. İ ain't Adam's nurse maid. Hold it a minute. Well, what do you think I am, a mind reader? İ'm waitin' for Adam myself. Adam's apartment doesn't answer, what'll I do? Try standing on your head in Times Square. Find him, dumbbell. What is it? No, not yet. İ've tried every speakeasy in the city. İ even tried his home, the guy never goes home. All right, I'll head him off. Well, where in the... Good morning, John. What do you mean, "good" morning? What's the idea of all this stuff about the greshams? You got every newspaper in town screamin' his head off. You ain't a child. The greshams are organization men, our organization, you can't pick on them. Did you say, "can't"? Why, John, be yourself. As assistant district attorney, I can tear gresham's head off and throw it in his face. Furthermore, that, John, is just what I'm going to do. İ'm telling you... İ'm telling you lay off. And I'm telling you go lay an egg. Doc gresham is one of the city's four compensation doctors. And he's been falsifying his records, charging the city big fees for phony services he never rendered, gypping the taxpayers. He's been putting down hangnails and sore thumbs as broken arms and legs. Charging for amputations and x-rays when he's prescribed corn plaster and liver pills. On a salary of 6,000 bucks a year, Dr. Gresham has salted away more than $400,000 of the taxpayer's money in his little tin safe deposit box. İ know, I'm the assistant da, I examined that little box myself. Four hundred thousand good, round stolen dollars in it, and you tell me to lay off. Do you think this is news to me? Why, you fool, I've been getting my cut. İ know what gresham's doin', he's one of my boys. Yeah? Well, then it's going to be just too bad for one of your boys. Gresham did me good. He knocked me out of two of the best years of my life, and you helped him. Well, he's one of your boys and I'm assistant da, so you try to help him now. Listen, Tony, you're chuckin' away a career. You're committin' suicide, political suicide. Forget you're a da. Forget about this investigation. We'll make you a judge. İ'll put you on the bench, boy, and this whole business will blow over. Blowing over doesn't interest me. Blowing up is what I'm after. İ'm warning you, Tony, you can't do this! Oh, I can't, eh? Well, they couldn't put al Capone in jail, but his mail's being delivered to Atlanta right now. But you're a part of the machine yourself. Sure, I'm the monkey wrench in the works. Connect me with Jim, hurry. There's a gentleman to see you, sir. A Mr. Levine. Lou veen? Lou... Oh, you mean levine? İs he levine? Yes, sir. Show him in. Come in, izzy. İ haven't seen you in a dog's age. That's right. Well, what's up? İn trouble again? No, we're not in trouble. Who's your playmate? Spike Murphy. İf your artillery bothers you we'll check it for you. Don't mind, we'll keep 'em. Only a thought. How was gilmurry when you left him? How did you know gilmurry sent us? Because he's the only cluck I know dumb enough to want to dispose of me with such originality. Well, when do you shoot me? -Huh? -Or perhaps you're going big game hunting, huh? We got orders to make you -lay off gresham. -Lay off gresham. Ha ha. Well, what do you think of that? Hey listen, you mugs. You're in a tough spot, much tougher spot than I am. Get me? The greshams are sunk. Gilmurry will be worse than sunk when the papers tomorrow break what I got on him. And you two rod handlers will burn browner than overdone hamburger. You wanna know why? Because when gilmurry is through as boss around here, you won't have anybody to protect you. And you know what your good friend, gilmurry, will do then? İ'll tell you, I know the guy. He'll take a run-out, don't you see? Pass the buck right back to ya. Claim he had nothing to do with this, and because he's gilmurry they'll believe him. And because you're a couple of cheap tinhorns they won't believe you and you'll fry. Oh, another thought. Maybe you'd like a cup of coffee, sit down. How about a nice piece of maple layer cake? Some French vanilla ice cream. You know I feel sorry for you two boys. İ wish I could do something for you, but... Say... İ've got an idea. Well, one more bite and I'll bust. Now, don't you be nibbling this on the way home, izzy, remember this is for your mother. Thanks, Mr. Adam. The two of us will report for work the first thing in the morning. Good boys. So long, Mr. Adam. Oh, haven't you boys forgotten something? You made a heel out of gilmurry all right. No, nature beat me to it. He was a heel from the start. Well, that may be a feather in her cap, but I wouldn't be in your shoes for a million bucks, Mr. Adam. How can you be so calm? Say, after all the fireworks you started you'd probably be crazy enough to run for district attorney. Then you'd sure get shot. Mr. Adam, gilmurry, he's outside with a couple of men. İ told you so! Say, what's the big idea? Where's your gun? Gun? What do I want a gun for? Some people use 'em to shoot ducks with. Show him in, sister. Oh, Tony. İt's all right, kid. İt'll have to happen sooner or later. Now you scram. Come on. So, gentlemen, won't you step in? Willie, where's spike and izzy? Over at Murphy's speakeasy I suppose, as usual. -Well, get 'em quick. -Aw, gee. Step on it, I'll knock you loose from your buck teeth. Go on, there's going to be trouble. Trouble? -Oh boy. -Hurry. İ guess you think I'm pretty sore at you. Well, I ain't at all. Then why did you bring along these 10th Avenue car boys, huh? Well, say how did I know you wasn't sore at me. No hard feelings. Hey, what the... Well, well, well. Say, you boys ought to know one another. Shake hands. All members of this club. They're good boys, John. Perhaps you can take 'em off my hands. İ'll not be needing a bodyguard now. After all, you hired them first, John. Sure, I'll take them over. You guys scram outside and wait for me. And that's that. İ come over to tell you that we're washed up with the greshams. After the spot they put the party in we don't want nothin' more to do with 'em. Well, they're through, eh? Tony, judge gresham is resigning from the bench. İ'm through fooling around with crooks like them. From now on, I'm gonna support a square guy. Maybe I should bust out crying. Not crying, my boy, laughing. You're gonna be the new appointee. You're as wrong as two left feet, John. İ'm not going to be the new appointee. Not? You mean you won't take the job? All words to that effect. Are you crazy, Tony? What do I want with a judgeship? You mean it ain't big enough maybe. Judge gresham was a big shot. Yeah, he was. And so would I be till I crossed you and your machine. Do you think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life taking orders from you and every cheap little ward healer of yours? Jumping every time the party rings a buzzer? Kissing the feet of a lot of political fat heads? Hearing cases that are in the bag? Toting and cringing, a grade-a office boy to a party that makes up in beef what it lacks in brains? Not me. İ'm done with all that, you hear? İ'm through. Don't be a fool. Where'd you ever get without somebody big backing you? Nowhere and that's just where I'm headed this minute. İ should be a monkey jumping every time you jerk the string, say. İ'm gonna quit now before I begin to look like a monkey. İ'm gonna be my own man again. İ'm going back to my own people where you don't have to be a rat to succeed. İ don't get you. No, and you never will. Listen, John... A lawyer's job is like a doctor's, that's what it should be, a guide, a helper, a big brother to a lot of poor, trampled slobs who can't hold their own against party bosses like you. Not a trickster and a cheat, but a counselor and a friend. That's what I was, and that's what I'm going to be again. And that's why I don't want your judgeship or anything else that you've got to offer. İ'm finished, washed up, fed up, with you, and your party, and your politics. You'll change your mind, and when you do, come around and see me. İ will. When she has triplets. Got a statement, Mr. Adam? Sure. Life is just a bowl of cherries, and you can quote me. Okay. İt's swell to be back. Yeah, it even smells good. That's not the half of it, dearie. Some day, Mr. Lawyer man, I'm gonna be a big shot and go uptown. Yeah? İ went uptown once. And that's not the half of it, dearie. Remember, -i told you so. -İ told you so.
