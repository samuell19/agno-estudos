You're a beautiful doggie. Oh, such a beautiful doggie. Come on, Aldo, go get it. Hop! Fetch. Fetch, come on. Fetch. Bring to daddy. My child, are you a boy, are you a girl? Alas, I don't know... You're probably wondering what your father's doing in the desert. Come on, come on. Know that I was not always a child of the desert. Before being Arab, your father was a negro. But this is a long story. A negro, in the cinema, is someone who writes films without credit. A humiliation that your grandmother endured even worse than me. - He wrote it. My son. - Hush. - There's no hiding it. - You don't have to shout it either. This too, it's totally you. It's obvious. Quiet! IT'S NOT ME, IT'S HIM You told me when I had my phlebitis. Who cares, ma'am. You're right. Listen, listen. That, too, is quite his father's humor. Shut it! But they have to know that it was you who did it. His name isn't listed anywhere. - It's true. - We're going. He wrote it. It's him, it's my son. Sorry, sir. Do you know my son? He's the one who wrote the film. It's Pierre Renaud. My son, Pierre Renaud. Charles? Saying negro means slave. And my own slaver was him: Georges Vallier. Oh, it's you. Finally. - Everything is there? - Yes. I worked until 4 a.m. - Perfect. Say so, big boy. The producers are there. And of course, you prefer me not to be seen. The eternal problem. Should we know before or not? This is the water bucket theory. The theory of what? You'll understand. Charlie? I'd like them to see me. Suppose you don't know the presence of the bucket. You were unaware of the presence of the bucket, hence the effect of surprise, hence the laughter. Second version a little less primary, I would say: You know about the bucket, and he still doesn't. Here, my little Charles. Since you are so dedicated... Come, come. You laugh in advance to see him arrive all perky. Smile. Smile. We savor the inevitable outcome. Come in, Charles. We're waiting for you. Laugh. You know the dilemma now. Thank you, Charles. You can leave. Gentlemen... I believe that Monsieur has not covered the whole question. It's over, we've laughed enough. Let him talk, you never know. These servants are sometimes priceless. I would like to point out a third version, more Hitchcockian, because it appeals to suspense. Sorry. Can you go down the hall? How? Me? But you're crazy. - Don't worry. - The bucket is empty. I put the bucket on the door. Sir doesn't know. I await his arrival. I tell myself: "What is sir doing?" I wait, I wait. But it takes a while, sir. Sir! This version is more unexpected. You have to sign, dad, it's important. It's not the moment. And again, there, you laugh less because the bucket is empty. So, is it over? Fourth version. It changes everything, with water. I'm tired of you hiding from me like a shameful illness! I am your syphilis. - You're telling me just at the moment... - At the moment what? An invitation to a cocktail party given by Aldo Barazzutti. You are going to go instead of me. Aldo Barazzutti is the Italian actor of the moment. What's this? I had put a cork, it must have jumped. Oh, hold on. - That's it, she's drowned. - U.S. too. My my my. I will see. Who are these people? Mr. George Vallier. Who? Mr. George Vallier. - A ghost. - Who? Oh dear. So that makes me very, very, very happy. Aldo Barazzutti. My respects. What an honor. What an honor. I have great admiration for you. - Me? But yes. May I borrow him from you? Like that, we're going to chat a bit. Sit on the other side. Here, here. So like that, you know everything about me. Sure. I've only been in Paris for a few days, but I know a lot about what's going on here. I know who is who, and especially who does what. Believe me. So you know... Vallier, all that? I know everything, Vallier, all that. What is happening here? Oh, it's curious. How's it going sir? Well, we're going somewhere else. So do you like my house? Very very beautiful. There. And there you go. Martini. Nope. Well... Both. There. That's it. Thank you. I've been following you for a long time. You're the one I would love to work with. - With me? - Yes, with you. Why? You look surprised. No, but it's the couch that... But what is this sofa? What is that? Sir, I'm sorry... What is this junk? Oh, ma'am. Your husband is better known than he thinks. A screwdriver in the pants? A way of saying that he has a fine feather. It's true. What is that? These sofas are traps. I'm sorry. Carl! Carl! I don't understand. You told me that... Come inside. We have more solid Louis XV sofas. Nope! Sorry, I don't feel very well. Exactly. It will be better in the Louis XV sofas. Don't insist. I'm sorry, we have to go. You're right. Oh yes, yes. Well, dear lady, my compliments. Dear sir, we'll call tomorrow. Aldo Barazzutti. - Madam, see you soon. - See you soon. I'm telling you it's not Vallier. I'm telling you it's not Vallier. I tell you it's not Vallier! "Isn't that Vallier?" She tells you. - What is she saying? - That it's not Vallier. No, it's his... It's his negro. Vallier is a little brown! Why are you screaming like that? It's annoying. Vallier, he's a little dark-haired guy. This man is a crook. Passing himself off as Vallier... Passing himself off as Vallier. Ah! Who do I see appear? I have to talk to you, it's important. I'm at your disposal. I came to tell you that I'm stopping. - What are you stopping? - Our collaboration. Or rather my exploitation. Because I'm fed up with misunderstandings, closet stories. My work is a vaudeville? What do you call that, you, the story of a guy... sleeping with his wife's best friend... and who doesn't know that the woman of this type sleeps with his? A well put together comedy of manners. Well, from now on, your comedies of manners, you will write them by yourself. If you get there. You have to sign that, dad. I'm busy. Good morning, Mr. Barazzutti. Oh, it's you. How's it going? Very well, thank you. Well, sit down, Mr. George Vallier. Who, me? Yes, yes. Sit down. Good. May I call you George? Vallier, Barazzutti, it's very formal. What matters is the man underneath. You want to write a screenplay for me? "A film by Aldo Barazzutti written by Georges Vallier." Great poster, right? By the way, I was thinking of an important thing. Me, what I want is for my author to be relaxed, at ease, freed from all worries. How about going somewhere, just you and me? An isolated corner, far from everything. We would be fine. I've heard of a hotel in Tunisia, calm, peaceful, where one can indulge in work, a sort of monastic retreat. The little skin. Yes, a kind of oasis. It's an image, because when I work, I don't care about the decor. I don't raise my head from the paper, because know, my dear Vallier... Now I call you Vallier again. I have to break this dirty habit. My dear Georges, for me, a scenario, it's 10% inspiration... and 90% perspiration. A little polish. I have a feeling we're going to get along well. You have character, and I like that. What did she do again, the filthy beast? She peed behind the curtain. Not that! Go, to the foot, immediately. You will have it, your correction. Go on. You know it's forbidden to get on the bed. Who gave me a vicious beast like that? You know the price, you naughty mutt. Oh no. It's too good. I can no longer do without you. Shut up, bad dog. Seriously, Valerie, come with me. I'm not free. Just a few days. We are always in a hurry. I have to watch the paw all the time. Both in the sun... We will take long walks. Valerie, I'll sleep at the foot of your bed, like that. And your wife, what are you going to tell her? The truth. That I'm leaving with the number 1 French author and that he can work only in the sun. - She won't come with you? - She can't, old lady. Asthma. But he is clever, my doggie, when he wants. Oh, Valerie... When you look at me like that, I can't take it anymore. Do you want that there, dear? Doggie! I'm going to send you to the pound. It's not okay? "The Death of the Swan" at 9 months old? There is no age for swans. Charlotte... I am a dancer. I was made to be a swan, not a laying hen. Good. There. The swan is dead. You are happy? And Barazzutti? There is a small problem. I am a bailiff at the Paris court. May I come in? I regret to inform you that I have come to seize your furniture. You are welcome. Do your duty. As you believed to have to remain deaf to my command the most imperative, I see myself constrained, on behalf of the Department of Justice... and under section 592 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which formally stipulates that... - Psst! What? - Table. - We can't move it. Calm down. Big guys like you. Well? The chair, there. Quick. It's bolted. The television. The vase is for me. Leave me. Shit, shit, shit. Shit. Shit. What is this comedy? I would like to talk to you first of the legal notion that distinguishes furniture real estate. The furniture... from the Latin mobilis, "mobile," therefore implies that the seizure of movables is, consequently, the input of what moves. Exactly, that is motionless. So it's real estate, from the Latin immobilis, "not moving". We'll meet again. He moves. He moved. There. I have felt it. Get the hell out of here. What's wrong with Barazzutti? Ah. It is... That is to say, he wants us to go to Africa to write. So are you going to leave? For a long time? 2, 3 days. It's not long. And then it's important for my career. As long as I'm here for his arrival... A bold but simple plan: I wrote a superb screenplay, I left Barazzutti gasping at my talent and I revealed my true identity to him. It was enough for me to be the handsome Georges Vallier for a few days. Aldo. How are you? - Let's go? - Yes. Aldo. - Aldo. - Oh... Have you come, my little pigeon? - How nice, that. - Dear Madam. I have to tell you something. Open your suitcase, you. How? Right here? Oh dear, my asthma. Open up, I tell you. Yes, my dove. You know, you are dealing with a huge star. I know that better than anyone, Madame. But what you don't know, maybe, is that he's also a huge sloth. What is that? Oh it's... You don't need that. But no. If he has any difficulties, call me. Ma'am, I have no doubt that... Oh no, I insist. You're not going on vacation. - Nope. And that? It's a pen, right? If I wanted to take a vacation, I wouldn't go with him. And who would you go with? But with you, my dove. There. You know women. Flight to Tunis, immediate boarding. We go there above all to work. Valerie, a more mio. What is that? It's Valerie's Tweety. Say hello to Aldo, Tweety. Tell him good morning. Well? Is there anyone who'll open the door for me? What is this hotel? Time to change and we get to work. How chic, then. It will be fine. Very well. They didn't spoil you, Vallier. It's ridiculous, this thing. I'll tell Aldo, he will have a good laugh. Absolutely. What does it mean? Do you intend to put Georges Vallier in this dump? Still... Call the front desk right away. Hello? Look at this. No but... Come in, my dear Aldo, and sit down. I finish a small sequence. "I want..." There you go. I think we'll be fine here to work. If we are not well here, I don't know where we will be well. You see, my dear Aldo, since I had the chance to meet you, and even during the whole trip... Sit down. I thought about your character. I have a few thoughts to make, before I start writing it. It is superb, this room. I said it's superb. Um, yes. Yes... When they found out I was Vallier, then... They knew you were Vallier? Yes. Why? Nothing. Nothing. I was telling you about your character, and here we come to a very important point. I can enter? Oh dear. It is great, this room. We already know that. We are here to work. It's huge, I say. So? What's wrong with my character? Nothing. He has nothing. Well, "nothing"... It is even good, very, very good. I mean that we would have to analyze the components... It's Hollywood, the bathroom. Yes, I... Ah yes, the components. It should... It's a real swimming pool he has, sir. Huh, Tweety? Who is the star here? That's what I wonder, too. Who's the star here? It's you, my dear Aldo. It's you. I get it. Go on. I admit that after this morning's work, we are a little tired, and I want to admit that a little rest... So? I admit that we are tired, but tomorrow, we work. We are not one day away. Oh, here they are. It's them. The journalists. Mr. Vallier, it was you I wanted to see. No, you. - Me? - How are you doing? I present to you Miss Valerie. Charles. How's it going? I wanted to tell you... Let's digress a bit. They really have nothing to put in their mouths. It's complete for me. A photo with the foot on the table. Another now standing, with one foot on the chair. Another standing on the chair. Like that. Very well. And for the fourth, step back and stand there. Come on. Very well. Arms crossed. Uncross your arms. Let's go. Very well. It doesn't matter if no one recognizes you. Basta. Stop it. What's he doing, this asshole? They've agreed to interview you tomorrow. You are too good. It couldn't have been easy. Nobody knows you here. But why are you sulking? Pure coincidence. You have no right to stay here. You do not have the right. - Do you know who you're talking to? - Nope. To the great Aldo Barazzutti. Go park further away, Mr. Barazzutti. What is this shitty country? They don't have a cinema? It's insane. Good. I'm going to park the car. Hurry up. We are not in parts. What are you laughing at all the time? I didn't laugh! Come to see. Come to see. You see the gentleman over there, who has a colorful shirt and a headband? There will be 1 dinar for each of you... Here. Hold this. - She's not here, Valerie? - Nope. She pissed me off, I sent her for a ride. - That's a shame. - Why? You know that you were very well known here? - Are you kidding me? - Nope. I met Tunisians who recognized you. Oh yes? Did they recognize me? - Oh yes. Autograph, Mr. Barazzutti. Who? Me? Yes, sir. That's good. There. So? Yes, but a kid, that doesn't mean anything. An autograph, Mr. Barazzutti. Did you recognize Aldo Barazzutti? Here. Where is Valerie? She's never here? Here. There. I bet you want an autograph too. My little rascal... - Leave Mr. alone. - Leave. When you're a star, you have to put up with the inconveniences. Here, my little one. Champagne! Oh, but that's for me. Where is Valerie? So, old man. Go on. As soon as we arrive, we work. What does he want, doggie? He wants to ride on his mistress's bed? He knows he can't go up. No, he has no right. What is he doing there? What's got into him? Tweety! It's naughty. You're not alone here. Go on. Put him in the bathroom. There's no reason. Come on, Titi, wise. He won't bother you anymore. - You're sure? Yes. Nasty animal. Tweety! Down! Lie down, lie down... You'll see. No, coward Tweety! What is it? Aldo and Titi fought, like dogs. Aldo and Titi? I don't want to see this guy anymore. Can I sleep here? Your communication with Paris, sir. Hello? Is that you, darling? Yes. Hello. It's okay? Do you work well? Yes, yes, I'm fine... Are you coming home the day after tomorrow? Yes. Why? Because you might find the apartment a bit empty. Why? Well, Me De Gros found an article of the code which allows real estate to move. What bothers me is electricity. - What, electricity? - They cut it too. Like gas. Although I'm doing with camping gas. I'm worried about the phone. I feel it is hanging by a thread. But do not worry. The essential, is that you work well. - About that, don't worry. No, I say... What's this? Jackals barking in the desert. There are plenty of them this season. Oh! Mosquito. Charlotte, my soul is crippled with remorse to know you are so far away, so alone, so pregnant. You don't have cold feet, do you? Nope. Because I do. You have your Tweety. Titi, he is being punished. It's not like a man, a Titi. Can I put my foot there? There? Yeah, there. Yes, but there, it's not the same than when you asked me if you could put it there. Fuck you, huh? - No no. Can you warm my shoulders? I'm cold. Oh damn. Oh, that hurts. - What's the matter? - It's gout. It fits in the thumb, and bam, it launches. -In the newspaper, they say that Vallier is a seducer. Seducer, seducer... -In the section of big cats. That's right, I read it too. Oh, that... So, what is he waiting for, the king of beasts? I have slack in my claws. I'll sharpen them for you. He's tired, the lion, this evening. Isn't the safari over? He's going to ground like a wounded beast in the dark. We breathe well here. This time, I held it between four eyes. I felt that a good day of intensive work awaited us. It may not be your character, but... Come on, let me tell you about it. I have a scenario in mind. This is the story of a worker priest which is embroiled in a great social conflict. There are restructuring issues in the Lorraine steelworks. Good. I'm listening to you. It has been years since French cinema is locked away in vaudeville closets. I don't complain about it, because I found fame and fortune there. Certainly, of course. But you see, I'm tired of these eternal cuckold stories, so I think that it is time to address the current problems, unemployment, death, euthanasia... Things that don't exclude comedy, by the way. Yes, yes. You will object to me that we're both worth millions in comedy. It's true, it's true. There, I shout: "Halt, my dear Aldo! "Let us not be chained by our accounts in Switzerland." I know there is a paradox in driving a Bentley and talking about the crisis, but we know that cinema can also be a political weapon. Eh, yes. That's true. Are the arms straight enough? Yes, but stretch your legs too. The best topics are everyday ones. Am I arched enough, there? Don't waddle. We do not realize that the derisory is everywhere. And the rhythm? Do you mind counting? - Count? - Yes. - It helps me. - Oh. Why not? You are going to have the most expensive lifeguard in Paris. So let's go. 1, 2, 3. 1, 2... Stretch your legs. 1, 2, 3. Let's go. 1, 2, 3. Could you teach my son a lesson afterwards? Oh no, no. There are... There are... There is an error. I... I give a... I'm not... But yes, yes, yes, yes. He is an excellent teacher. I'll stop. He is a teacher and he takes the little one. Bellissima. 1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3. Extend your arms. 1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3. Barazzutti doesn't want to keep you, it's not up to me. I am here to work. - I'm not bothering anyone! If I, I'm not going to spend my nights in the fireplace. Come on, boom. Let's go. Ouch. But I have heels. I don't care. It was last night that you could've had this peach. - I was tired. - Not shiny. Me, I want to stay. No way. Admire the charm of this landscape. In the evening, we admire this huge palm grove for its charm and calm. Let's not panic. Don't get bogged down in problems. Here is the swimming pool. Oh yes. Oh yes. The bungalows are over there, isolated, quiet. Isolated? It's perfect. It is superb. Let's proceed with method. (a) Vallier, who doesn't know that my name is Vallier, must not see me. (b) Barazzutti, who does not know Vallier, must not see Vallier. Which is equivalent to (a) = (b): Vallier must not see Barazzutti either. It's bright. Do you want to sleep, Titi? Come and sleep, come on. - Quick, Barazzutti. - What, Barazzutti? She was good? I thought about it. The plane can wait. Go on. - We're going to sleep? - Oh! You're still special, Vallier. Have you seen my suitcase? - It's going to dry. - What's going on? - Hush. - What's gotten into you? - Valerie... Well yes, I love you. This is the first time I've done this effect. Quick, Barazzutti. Hey! Don't stay there. - Why? - There is sun. - So what? -It's terrible at this hour. It drives you crazy. Boom! It swells the eyes, blisters everywhere... But we're fine here. We must return. Go on! Blisters everywhere... Quick! You don't plan to wear your tuxedo? - Yes, tonight. You've seen it? Have you seen the pants? There is more to go to town. What's he still bothering us, that one. Can I have an autograph, Mr. Barazzutti? Ah. Now you know who Aldo Barazzutti is. There. You make me very happy. 1 dinar. What, 1 dinar? - It's the car park that's paying. - Oh, good. What are you laughing about? It's aphrodisiac honey. It's very good. It's very good, when you're afraid of running out of clubs. And to say that there are people who need that. They're not like me, huh. There it is. Do you have a tuxedo for Monsieur? No, but I have pretty slippers. Slippers with a tuxedo? Why not? Do you have black slippers? Hi Mom? This time, that's it, I'm sure. He said "I love you" to me, and it was like a big hit. I just woke up. I can't go to the casino like that. Why not? With a bow tie, it's... At least you won't look like a tourist. Well, that's not bad. I like it. Do you want one too, dear Georges? Oh, no. No. Me, I immediately look disguised, with that. That's not bad. "Dear Marie." But where did he go? Vallier, where have you been? Oh dear. Well, George! Ah, shit. Here, here. It's true that I don't mind. - Yes. If it rains, presto, neither seen nor known. It's this way. We must return. Over there. ME, SIR! ME, SIR! You see? I can't blend in. Everyone recognizes the great Aldo Barazzutti. No, one. There. There. You know, my dear Georges, a metaphysical anguish comes to me. I'm afraid I'll run out of club tonight. What? George, I need honey. But finally... You have to go back to work. We're going to get spotted eventually. The kids... - Exactly. Here, everyone recognizes me, whereas you are nothing. George, honey. Come on, boom! Hop! For his birthday Tonight, I'm going to do it to myself You haven't seen a gentleman with curly hair, with pants like that...? Come on, boom! So? - Give me. - Take it. Hop. We must return to Paris. Already? But we couldn't even write a line. Exactly, here, we... we can't work. I feel disturbed, my head's elsewhere. If your wife saw us... The swimming pool, the tuxedo, the walks... It's not serious, that. It's not serious. We're going. Tomorrow then. 'Cause tonight there will be one more cuckold in the bush. I'll tell you one thing. I'll tell you one thing, my dear... Georges, the brunette at the pool, it's her birthday. Tonight is going to be his party. We should start talking about the subject. Sure. Pay attention to the bend. What is that? It's stuck. What's that? Nothing. I was talking to my camel. I prefer that. I finally had a few hours of work ahead of me. You are free? How about a walk? - It's over. - Up to town. The camel's tired. Can't we go for a walk, then? Go see the director. So just a little trick. You are nice. You can kneel this noble animal? - Right now. Come on, lie down. Go on. Lie down. Hop. Hop. Lying. Boom! Lying. Go on. Look, you're doing this. Lying. Lying. Go on. Hello. Come on, lie down. Look, like That. Hop. What is he doing? I don't know. It's camel arthritis. Come and help me. Yes, boss. So it's simple. Hand there, foot there, and presto! Attention. 1, 2, and boom! Come on, boom. Tremendous. One more hit. 1, 2, boom! Come on, boss. Hop! I must tell Barazzutti that his fiancee is in Vallier's arms. No, not Vallier. Vallier, it's me. Hello. That's what year? 1515. You realize? It's like Marignan. Lots of things happened that year. - Who built it? - Rashid the Terrible. Why "the Terrible"? We never knew. Is he stupid or what? Honey, don't be racist. It's not because you're married to a former para... Mrs. Weiss is there? We don't have a Mrs. Weiss. Are you sure? She is accompanied by a child. It's beautiful. What an inspiration... I'm really thirsty. My friend, go get something fresh for Madame. Yes, boss. With diligence. Go on. That's pretty. Or why not this one? He's beautiful, don't you think? For 10 dinars, really... Very refined. Very refined. I'm not very all-in, but if you want it, it's yours. That's very amusing. So what? - That's great. - Quite a design. Do you want one? Say so, my dear. Can you chat for us? But... Come, my boy. It's over there. How much is it? It's 10 dinars. There. Your turn now. Go ahead, sir. What does it mean? 10 dinars? It's incredible. You want the skin of my client? It's too expensive. What do you want, with your funny accent? It's too expensive, right? Do you want my ruin? You take the store, the city, everything, but you give me the price. I'll give you the price. For example 6 dinars. Where are you from, false brother? I said 8 dinars, that's all. I'll tell you: It's 7 dinars or nothing. Okay, 7 dinars. And that's the job, 300 off. Yes, but it's broken. Let him be. I'll tell you: We're going to talk quietly, without getting upset, we'll sit down. We will both talk. - What is that? - It's 15 dinars. Hey there, I say stop, my old man. It'll end up costing us more. You leave, boss. That, you say 15 dinars, That, 7 dinars. Me, I prefer that. It's more original. My friend, we must know what we are talking about. I'm going to show you something. Look at this. That's done almost entirely by hand. This, too. Look at the delicately hemmed frills. - Like it? - I don't know. But did you admire before your amazed eyes the object and its polychromy? Polychromy, that? That's polychromy. It's too fragile for the boss. Looked. Ah, well, that. Take that, boss. It's very good. What is that? A shepherd's trumpet to call the sheep. We don't have any. It even works without sheep. Look. 500 millimeters. The trumpet? Gray pepper. The trumpet is 7 dinars. I prefer this dish. We take that. It's been 7... Plus 14. Who will pay for all this? Shit. Quick, Barazzutti. Hey, look. I found a great one. Haven't you changed yet? You look disguised. Tonight, there will be one more fulfilled woman under the Tunisian sky. - Precisely... - For his birthday... Exactly... Oh Vallier. Dear Yseult! What a paradise! Oh, my Tristan! What is that? Sorry, but I slipped. It's honey. I slipped. She is good. Help me! Help me! Go on. Your wife's calling you from Paris. It's urgent. From Paris? I'm coming. It's my son. He did it. It's for tonight. Already? You know, it's been 9 months. You work well? Yes yes. Well, we don't stop. Not too much trouble? Problems? Don't know. Hello? Don't cut. Who's speaking? Tonight, it's going to hit. Fasten your seat belts. It's Aldo the class. Hop! Prego. Mr. Barazzutti's in his room? - Yes sir. - Thank you. - It's okay? - Thanks very much. And you? But he's my mahout. Hop, we fuck. Ah anyway! Oh, excuse me. Oh no, now is not the time. I thought I recognized someone. Come on, boom. Barazzutti, now. Shit! And me, then? There are more urgent matters. Take off your slippers this time. Good. So? Eh? Where is he? In the closet. It is my job. I put people in the closet every day who tremble with fear when you open them. You haven't seen it? It's not important. I get it. Good evening. You understood, did you? Well, you're in luck. Aldo! - Aldo! - Psst. The Italian, he's lying on the floor in my room. But what...? - It's honey. - What honey? For the club. What's this? That's enough. Go to your room. It's me. I can enter? Oh, you, you... Wouldn't this be the time to take each other like animals? What is it, like beasts? Is he there? - There's a guy in the closet. - What's wrong with you all? I know you're there! By God, my husband. What did you say? - Why? - For nothing. Open! Good. Closet? OK. Little man. Are you there, big guy? - As you see. - Did you hear what she said? - "By God, my husband." You're happy? You said they were theatrical lines. You see, it exists, people in closets. It's always the same thing. He'll say, "I know you have a lover." I know you have a lover! It's not true! It must be noted that the dialogue isn't terrible. I, now, I will make him open the cupboard. Go ahead, look. Everything is expected. I'm bored with vaudeville. - The door. I'm not stupid. Even he doesn't believe it. By the way, what...? Hold on. What? Repeat that! What are you doing here? And you? I've been sleeping with her for years. When Mr. arrives... You understand? And you? You can't blame me either: I sleep with her, too. So when you arrive... Oh, but then... We are both. Is there...? I don't know, I just arrived. - The cupboards. - That's enough, you. As for you, I take it upon myself because of the little one, but we'll see later. Bitch, are you cheating on me with him? And one more thing... Occupied. - I came back for your birthday. I will never leave you alone again. Your behavior is shameful. - Sir. - Sir. Go on. Come on, it's not time to sleep. Go! Go! Go. Why are they slapping you? Never mind. In bed! I want to apologize for earlier. Let me introduce myself: George Vallier. "George" who? Tomorrow, we go home. Here we do nothing. - And my beautiful cake? - Now's not the time to think about it. My little Georges, the light. - My beautiful cake... - Shit. I forbid you to talk to other men. You're mine now. It's unbelievable, the effect I have on him. It's sure, mom, it's sure. He's the man I've been waiting for. When he took me back in his arms, wham, a light went off in my head. Like the first time. Stronger! - To me? - Yes, to you. Stronzo. Oh yes. Blow. Blow. For God's sake! What? Eat it quickly. - Oh, say... - What? Honey... I'm not well. Shit. I have wings when it's you who calls me Because you are the most beautiful My little Isabelle Have you seen how nice he is? You wouldn't do that for me. You didn't tell me it was your birthday. Dude, it suits you very well. How glad I am to see you. The great Aldo Barazzutti. You don't introduce me to your friend? - I'll tell you everything. - I'll introduce myself: Pierre Renaud. What he wanted to tell you is that I'm his negro. Ah, his negro... We ask for Mr. Pierre Renaud on the phone. I think it's for me. Excuse me. It's me... Pierre Renaud. Are you trying to poison me? So what? No, nothing. It was the clinic. - So what? - My wife gave birth. We're not going to make a drama out of it. That is good news. Hake a cigar. Thank you. - He doesn't wanna make a drama out of it! - Why are you doing one? Yes. Why, Vallier? But I don't. I don't care. I don't care. Oh, great. So, is it a boy or a girl? Eh? I forgot to ask. It's not true! Didn't you ask him? Well, what the fuck can it matter? It's not your child. It's true, Vallier. I know his name is Georges Vallier. If I find him... I'll kill him! "Well, my dear Vallier, you're in trouble. Father, I found an Italian passport under the bed. George. George. Oh my love. Mr. Barazzutti, an autograph! But yes. Why not? Autograph. I have photos in my luggage. Did you recognize the great Aldo? Nope. I recognized the dinar man. It's not okay, right? So? And my dinar? Mr Barazzutti! And my dinar, Mr. Barazzutti? Mr Barazzutti! Tonight, we are escaping. - You have an idea? - Nope. Okay. Attention, everyone is ready? Is everyone seated? - And hop. - There. - Mr. George. - Mr. Aldo. Will you pass me the bucket? - Certainly. Look carefully. And there you go. Attention. And now, do you want to cross to the other side? - "On the other side." - Look carefully. On the other side. And now, watch what I do. I put the bucket on it. Ladies and genflemen, take a good look. Mr. George, come in. Second version's a little less primary. You're with me? - Yes. - Go to the other side. And on the other side, me. I close it and I pick up the bucket. No, no. Water is too scarce here. Take camel piss instead. It's better. There. Give me that. It'll be less funny. So I put the bucket on... the door. Mr. Aldo, everyone is watching us. Everyone is wise, but you have to hurry anyway. And I'm waiting for Mr. Aldo. I wait. I wait. I wait. I wait. I'm still waiting for Mr. Aldo. But what is he doing? That's quite long, Mr. Aldo. It's long! So? What is he doing? - What is he doing? - Shit! I can't seem to start... The car. How dare you? I am the great Aldo Barazzutti. So, let's see, the great Aldo Barazzutti... - Exactly. Your last movie, it was "Clear Behind the Ears?" Yes, sir. So I read: "Heartbreaking. Appalling spectacle. "35 tickets in Rome "on a Saturday night." 37. And I read: "Aldo Barazzutti makes people laugh more than himself. "A black belly." What is this thing? I see. This one never loved me. It's not true. A jerk! Say, you! The war! If you hadn't pretended to be... - He... - Silence! You, Mr. Vallier, interest me a great deal. I don't like vaudeville. You are wrong, my dear. I'm watching you. I think your pet it-bourgeois author name will serve to publicize our fight. The Italian can leave. - Thank you. - But I'm not Georges Vallier. I am Pierre Renaud. Peter Renaud! I've never been... - But, George... My little Georges, what's the point of all that? Look at me. Am I talking? It's true, I'm no longer worth anything, I admit it. I'm shit. So you are everything. They were right. We must bow before the insight of these men of the desert. Bastard! It's been a year now since Aldo left. No one pays Georges Vallier's ransom. That doesn't surprise me. But the leader is obstinate. I believe him to be proud and incapable of recognizing his mistakes. And here we go again. I understood why they are called nomads. That's it, we got it. I... Can I? Nope! Go away! Go away! Nope! Lying! Go away! Drop it off. Shit! Free. I'm free. I will finally know if you are a girl or a boy. Arrival from Tunis, flight Tunis-air 732, Exit door 43. That's dad, kids. My love!
