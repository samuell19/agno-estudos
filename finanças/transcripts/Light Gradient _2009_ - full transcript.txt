A fox and a hare meet one day. The hare says to the fox, "Can we be friends? " The fox thinks for a moment. "That depends." "On what?" the hare asks. "Firstly, I hope you're not a vegetarian. Secondly, I hate getting up before dawn. But most importantly, we should have a similar sense of humour." "No problem," says the hare, "I?m game." Do Robin and I have a similar sense of humour? No idea. The outing, at any rate, was my idea. Although I'm not so sure anymore. Maybe it was his idea. That would be just like him. Come on... What's the blue line? "Light gradient..." We'll ride that way. Okay? That's where we just were. Weren't we? So if we've been riding for an hour, and that's five miles... ... we should be right there. The tent poles aren't in here. Then look again. Well, they're not here. - Oh well... Did you leave them behind on purpose? Maybe. -You left them behind on purpose? Brilliant idea. Then we'll sleep on the ground. Some hot tea would be nice. What's up? Didn't we leave the bikes right here? No, they're much farther up that way. Shit! I think they're over that way. Or maybe that way? Or maybe that way? Or maybe that way. Or up there? Whatever. This is so fun, isn't it? So it's my fault. It's my fault that the bikes are gone? Are you going back? How? -We'll continue on foot, what do I know? No idea, Johann! Sorry, do you have any food for us? No. Sorry. -Are you sure? You see, we're really hungry. What's in that bag? Okay, keep calm... Let us by, we want to go now. It's all right, I'll have a look. -What? What do you want? -I'll check the bag. Why did you do that? Thank you. -Yeah. Yuck, the ground! We'll swim to the other side. Oh, well... Some people are just good. Fuck! Shit, I've cut myself! Anyone home? Hello! Hey! Hello! Hello, is anyone there? Johann! Hey Johann, the door's locked! It's jammed. -Jammed? Don't be such a halfwit! Open the door! Hey! Johann! Johann, where are you? Drop that. Who's that? - Drop it! I just wanted to... - Shut up! I don't want trouble. Shut up. Get back against the wall. - What's going on? Stay right there. Hey. - Hey. What's going on here? Who is that? Hello? Hello? I'm opening the door. You little prick! - Who are you? What are you doing here? Come on, let's go. I asked you who you are. I'm Grit. I live here. - We just got lost. Come on. Are you hungry? I'm cooking. What are you cooking? Anyone want another piece of meat? - I don't eat meat. But I do. Thanks. - Sorry. What are your plans for the farmhouse? Next I want to fix up the barn, put in guest apartments, for families, and hikers like you. With separate kitchens and baths... - Repair the water pipes first. Do it yourself. I can't. I don't know how. We need a plumber. - Oh yeah? The lakes around here are nice. We went swimming in that big one. It was great. I go there a lot. - But that bike path isn't... ... too good, with all those cobblestones. It's not so easy on the bikes. You guys came by bike? So where are your bikes? - Gone. What do you mean, "gone"? We left them by a tree, and when we got back they were gone. Vanished into thin air, in the middle of forest. Some more to drink? I'm good, thanks. - Me too. I can't show you. - Sure you can. Okay, when you surf... No, I never surfed. When I snowboarded, my problem wasn't turning this way, but rather this way. And not only the turns are hard, but... The surface is rock-hard, but on the black slopes it's much softer. But the black slopes, if that tells you anything, are really steep and fast. And if you can't stop, and you can't make right turns, you're shit out of luck. So I slammed into a skier... No, we don't have rats anymore. Okay, sheets and blankets are over there. Help yourself. And you can wash up behind the barn. Good night. - Good night. See you tomorrow. What are you reading? Let me have a piece of apple. Here you go. Grab him by the horns. Hey there! Slow down. Here you go... here. Hey... You like that, don't you? He's still pretty young. That's why he's so playful. Is... ... that your boyfriend? Robin? -Yeah. Yeah. Okay. A bit nervous, this goat. We shouldn't give him any more. He's been eating apples all day. Or else you'll burst, fatso. What else do you do around here? Not much going on, is there? That's how it is on a farm. There's always a lot of work to do. We can't travel, and... Everyone's gone now, so... ... I spend time with the animals and stuff. It's really cool here. Really nice. Can you tell that Robin and I are together? A little. I kind of figured as much. I wasn't completely sure, but... Why did you figure as much? There's just something between you. Don't stop. Stop it... hey! Put that back! Hey, I'm not a mechanic. You have to do it yourself. I'll tell you a story from these parts. In the 18th century, this was all dense forest. But less than 10 miles away is Witzlow, where on February 12th, 1729, a little boy is born. Nathan von Witzlow, the only offspring of an old and famous noble family. But the child grows to be a wild and difficult boy. Doesn't get along with people, not even his parents. Animals are the only things he loves. And his best friend is a bird that he himself tamed. Tutors try to teach him at least reading and writing, but in vain. He just refuses to learn. So his parents decide to send him to a cadet school on his 14th birthday. There he is to learn discipline. But it doesn't come to pass. The night before, he sneaks out. All he takes is his sharp hunting knife. And he doesn't return. The parents are, of course, fraught. They enlist all the help they can get to search for their son. It's the dead of winter. February. It's bitter cold. The men scour every inch of the surroundings, but... ... there's no trace of the boy. They have to call off the search. For a whole year, there's no sign of Nathan. Then, on his birthday, his mother finds a swan on the veranda, gutted, skinned and bedded on its own feathers. Now, she knows he's alive. What is it? You're going on an outing. Will you untie the rope? -Sure. Stop. -"P". Peter Parker. - That's not an actor. I'm quite finicky there. Counting... - Christiane Paul. You mean Paul, comma, Christiane. Paris Hilton counts as an actress. - Yes. Padberg, Eva. She's probably acted before. - No. No, she's a model. - Uh... Ten, nine, eight... - Wait, wait, I'm thinking. ... seven, six... How long have you two been together? We've known each other... ... for two months. So who's on top, and who's on the bottom? I'm just asking. Robin... Robin's on the bottom. You should've seen Henri's dad. He was a dancer. A very dainty, handsome, French type, with dark hair... ... on his chest, too, like Johann. He travelled the world with his dance company. At some point he left... - And never came back. Exactly. I wrote him a letter a week. - Mom, stop. It's all nonsense. What is it? Are you getting sick? I don't know... I think it was the berries. - What kind of berries? Little red ones, dark red. I found them by the lake. Grizzly berries. Let me have a look. Look into the light. That's what I thought. You're in for a couple days of fun. Can't we do anything? No. There's nothing we can do. There's no remedy. "February 19th, 1751. As in previous years, Baron von Witzlow sends a search party. to look for his missing son. The men carry weapons, provisions and a special trap. After several days, a cold spell catches them by surprise. It's so cold that all water freezes instantaneously.. Then it begins to snow heavily.... Metre after metre of snow falls, until it's impossible to even make a fire. Three weeks later, the men are finally found. Every last one of them frozen to death. Lying before them: A white swan, gutted, bedded on its own feathers." "There are frequent sightings of a manlike creature in the forests around Witzlow. But to this day., no one has collected the reward that the Baron posted at the time." What's going on? Are you leaving? There's something I have to find out. Have the berries completely fried your brain? I'm going back into the forest. You won't find it on your own anyway. We have to at least say goodbye. Then say goodbye. What's going on with you? You're acting totally strange. You're right. Should we tie it to the tree? -Yeah. How much longer will this take? This is pointless. For three days, they ask the hare the same questions. "What were you doing in the forest at night?" "Was there anyone with you? Why the ropes?" "And? What did you tell them?" asks the fox. "Nothing," says the hare. "They weren't listening anyway.." "I want to ask you something," says the hare. "Why did you end up leaving me alone in the forest? " The fox thinks for a moment. "I thought that was your idea." That might even be true. No idea. It would be just like me, I guess.
