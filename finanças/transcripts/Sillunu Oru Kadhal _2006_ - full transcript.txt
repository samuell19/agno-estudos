I was born in this peaceful and beautiful village. My name is... Kundavi, c'mon eat. No way. What do you want, dear? Yes, I'm Kundavi. Our family is the richest family in the village. Everyone come to my father to solve their problems. Sometimes, they come to me. What you did was wrong. You rap her head twice & give her the candies. This is my judgement. I had 2 very close friends. Tamizh & Subbu. We studied together from 1st std. Sorry... We roamed together. Local, Government Higher Secondary school. 11. This school will go to ashes. And then to Women's college in Ambai. Yesterday, a doctor came to see my father. He was wearing goggles and had a small mole near his eye. He was very handsome. How did you see the mole when he was wearing goggles? Just a second... We were unlucky not to study in co-education school or college. Our principal is... Give it fast. She might come. You cheats. Your parents have to be blamed. Sometimes boys from near by village come to our college to ogle at us. But they will be beaten black & blue by the police. Stop running. - Please leave us, sir. Devil. Who will come to our college to ogle at us? There was no one to ogle at us. Poor we girls! So, we decided that day. We decided that our marriage must be a love marriage. We started to look out for good boys. He looks nice, ah? Girls, look at him. Theatre is full. Get the film. Why're you both staring at me?! His moustache is very big. So what? That means he'll be very good in sex. Look at the one in red shirt. - Him? He looks like rogue. He is much better than your moustache guy. Get lost. She likes him. Why don't you get her married to him? No. She can marry him only after my death. Then die. Asking your father to die? If I can marry only afteryour death, then die. There were big fights. No one was ready for a compromise. We took a bold decision. They got very good men meeting their expectations. Inform my father, Kundavi. But I was unlucky. There is an alliance for Kundavi from Courtallam. Shall we fix the alliance? At her age I was a mother to 2 children. Fix her marriage soon. Oldie, I will kill you. How can I marry a stranger all of a sudden? I prayed to god not to let this marriage happen. Sister... - What? The groom has agreed for this alliance. Next month is your marriage. Get lost. She feels very shy. God too gave up. Everything is over. How will be my husband? Give it to me if it tastes bitter. Why do friends come for a marriage? With a hope that the groom will buy them drinks. But you never even bought us a water bottle to drink. And you are having beer all alone. Are we here to throw empty bottles? Are you blind? Drive carefully. If you want to commit suicide, do it alone. We missed death by a whisker. If I had to marry a man like him, I would've listened to my father. But I got carried away by his moustache. Has everyone come? He is your father-in-law. Give way. Here comes the bride. Smile please. Move. Buy me a skirt in her sari's colour. Isn't the red little bright? Look at her henna. Send messages later. Beat the drums. My life is finished. Subbaiah, did your daughter eat raw rice? It's raining very heavily today. # Walked down the aisle. # # And taken the marriage vows. # # The bride now holds the hands of her husband. # # Beat the drums. # # Our song will be as beautiful as the waterfalls. # # Our song will be as beautiful as the waterfalls. # # She is like the sweet of Ambasamudram, # # And fresh as Thazhampoo. # # He is like Azhagu Thevar's sickle of Aalvarkuruchi, # # ... and strong as Burma teak. # # Let's dance... # # ... like the rain drops dancing on earth, let's dance. # # Let's dance... # # ... like the bee buzzing around a flower for honey. # # Hey girls... # # Our king has now a new queen. # # God brought them together, since they were made for each other. # # Let's ward off the evil eyes. # # Let's offer prayers to God. # # This day is a wonderful day. # # She is like the sweet of Ambasamudram, # # ... and fresh as Thazhampoo. # # He is like Azhagu Thevar's sickle of Aalvarkuruchi, # # ... and strong as Burma teak. # # Let's dance... # # ... like the rain drops dancing on earth, let's dance. # # Let's dance... # # ... like the bee buzzing around a flower for honey. # Talk to him. Talk what? Whether your first night can be arranged right here? Get lost. # The food is waiting for the dry fish gravy. # # Like well prepared Biryani, both of your hearts are well baked. # # Delay not, else the fish gravy will get spoilt. # # Shall I wait for you near the door? # # Your hearts will be yearning to come closer. # # You can't sleep alone. # # Even the cot & the bed never sleep. # # You both are hot like the Nair shop's tea. # # She is like the sweet of Ambasamudram, # # ... and fresh as Thazhampoo. # # He is like Azhagu Thevar's sickle of Aalvarkuruchi, # # ... and strong as Burma teak. # # Let's dance... # # ... like the rain drops dancing on earth, let's dance. # # Let's dance... # # ... like the bee buzzing around a flower for honey. # # You were like the tooth pick # # but you are strong enough to pound the grains. # # Spread the bed & wait for him. # # I'll come home singing. # # This goat will jump the fence, because it is very eager to do it. # # I'm the rooster & you are the hen. # # Won't they kiss with their beaks? # # The groom is so hot, # # and their souls yearning to get closer, # # they'll weave themselves to one. # # Let's dance... # # ... like the rain drops dancing on earth, let's dance. # # Let's dance... # # ... like the bee buzzing around a flower for honey. # Go. You're doing too much. There is a saying that "It is a god's gift to get a good wife". That applies to husband too. My formula that love marriages are good now stands failed and disgraced. After 6 years... Mumbai. Are you a rogue to whistle? You don't behave like a school boy. Like father like son. Don't spoil my mood early morning. And don't make me a beast. Beast? Look at you, eating like a pig. What? Pig? You are a soar. What do you think of yourself? How dare you abuse me? What do you think of yourself? What are you? Awoman or a loud speaker? Eat. Aren't your parents at home? They are very irresponsible. Without worrying about me at home. They go out & romance. You eat. Even my parents' marriage was a love marriage. They fell in love before marriage. So, they are fighting now. But my parents didn't love before marriage. So, they love each other & go out. Oh god! It's getting late. I've to go. You take care. - Okay I'll take care. See you on Monday. - Bye Bye. - Bye... See you Kundavi. Kundavi... - Yes Mam. Where are you going? Sit. It's alright. Tell me. Today evening's my son's birthday party. Come there with your hero at 9. Madam, today is Saturday. So... Okay. - Okay mam, bye. Oh No! - I told you not to... You... # College girls & young women are after me. # She has come. - Is it? Keep this inside. - Why? Can't you keep it inside? I said go. Makes me do everything. I saw a superb scene in the lift. They were kissing in the lift. So what? I shouldn't have told you. I've finished my dinner. Can't you see the mirror? Think you're too clever! Daddy... - Yes dear. She is from Ambasamudram but trying to become American. What did you say? What did she say? You are from Ambasamudram but trying to become an American. Donkey! Open the door. Hey, what? She is so young. How dare she speak like that! You've grown so old. But you haven't learnt Hindi yet. Open the door. Why should I learn Hindi? O my Tamil girl! It's getting late. Come fast. Cheers! Yuck! Will you never give up that nasty localite's habit? We are class only to look, but really mass. Do you want me to sip it slowly? If I gulp it, it must rock me. Don't talk nasty things. Pour. Angel! There won't be any problem in this world if all wives are like you, right? Pour. Finished! Your quota is over. My sweetheart! Just one more peg. Don't be adamant. Didn't I tell you about a free show in the lift? To celebrate it, come on... pour. - I saw it, then I should also drink. I drink oryou drink is same, my darling, please one peg. You'll do a bottoms up. A digestive tomorrow will ease it. No... give it to me. Lily... Jasmine... You are keeping me happy, am I keeping you happy? Say it. I'm more happy with you than with my parents. Are you happy? I'm the happiest man in the world! - Don't shout! It's midnight. Dear, a happy man will never do wrong. - Started it, he'll not stop it. My dear, you're the reason for my happiness. Where are you going? - I want to share my happiness with others. Come here. I'm the happiest man in the world! Enjoy young man... enjoy. - Thank you. Dad, I can't bear this late night drama, go to sleep now. Got the stick. Ishu, your father is asleep. How many village problems should I settle man? -Yes, brother. Look, people are waiting with children in tow. Are all the people of 18 villages here? Later don't complain about that man or this man is missing. I've to visit many such village meetings. If you get a man, settle your problem instantly. Bloody idiot! Come here and do as we say. Why are you shouting at me? Bloody, didn't I tell you not to take individual decisions? Wait man, I'm not here foryou, I'm here for all the people here. Why are you shouting like the President? Given a chance everyone becomes a self appointed president... move. Brother is coming... move, brother is coming. Finish quickly. Take your leg, bloody. Bloody, will you pinch the hip of a child's mother? If hip is alluring, who will bother about if she's a mother or virgin. Just for pinching a woman's hip, you've all gathered here leaving your work, were you born to guests? Wait... wait... don't rush. Is it ready? It's ready, brother. Don't cry, isn't it a shame to me, you rascal? Okay, for pinching her hip, please forgive me your own son. After misbehaving with a woman, are you claiming to be our son? Bash him up! How proud he's feeling? Take it out. This is the last. I've a strong body and it's taking all the public beating. Wear it brother. We couldn't see this, how could you bear it? Got used to it. I'll contest elections with this. - Election? Yes, how much stick I got from public. If I ask votes, people will vote me to become CM on sympathy wave. I'll make you all MLA's - MLA's? Use powder, you're a genius, brother. The only leader to accept his mistake and get punished. - Long live! Leader of great self respect. - Long live! Bye... bye... let's meet in the next meeting. Long live future CM, future PM, future President. Stop it. - Have we reached home? I wanted to ask you this for long time. - What is it? You face bravely so many problems everyday, how many meetings you attend, but you're entering your home from back door? Isn't it cheap foryour status? - There's a reason for it. -What's it? My father-in-law is always in the front yard, if he stops me & asks any question, I'll get furious, if I get angry, criminal inside me will come out and it will wreck my family. Do I need it? - How can you think all this? We must always have foresight. Where are you coming in? - To your home. Friendship stops with the gate, don't come in to have free meals. Vellaisamy brother! - What? - Do you know this? How can I know unless you tell me? Get lost man. You're beating me for coming to tell you a news. I beat you unwittingly, tell me now. - No, I'll not tell. If you don't tell, my head will break. - That's... Start with usual brother. Okay. Brother, your family is starting a new rice mill, right? -Yes. Instead of naming it on you, they are planning to name it after someone else. Guruvamma! Brother, you pinched a woman's hip, that's her name. Yes... Chellathai... That's perfect... make a grand entry. Can't you hear my call? I did hear, both Chellathai and Guruvamma. Don't talk about that. Answer my question. Who am I? Father of my children. Who am I to you? - Husband. Who am I to your father? - Worst son-in-law. What? - I said eldest son-in-law. Got it? I'm your husband, father to your children, son-in-law to your father, I'm holding three positions in this family, it seems you're discussing about a name to the new rice mill. Yes, so what? Asking me what? One slap and you'll come to senses. How many problems I'm facing outside for this family, how many sacrifices I'm making, will you lose anything if you name it after me? What's that noise? - I'm talking here, father-in-law. Will I get scared if he asks me? Is your father a great Madurai Veeran with that big moustache? What's that noise again? - I'm talking father-in-law. Will I get scared if he calls me? - Loweryour voice. -Why should I? That's better. I'll thrash everyone here. How? Like you got beaten up just now in a public meeting. Has the news reached so fast? Not only this news another news has also reached us. Children! Come here. - What's it mother? Who didn't beat your father? - Venkatesh's father and Suresh's father. Have they left you so early? What a great children you've begotten. How will your children be? Can you name the rice mill after me or not? Answer me first. No chance. What's that noise? - Why are you after my life? You can hear it clearly, why are you asking again? You want to know everything. He's asking too many questions sporting a big moustache. Wait, I'll also sport a big moustache. Oh God! I got angry... they'll poison my food. Take it sir. Why is son-in-law raising hell there? - Nothing father. Devar... - Yes sir. What is Kundavi's husband doing? He's working with a car company in Bombay. Ask him to check ouryounger son-in-law's horoscope also. - Give me. Sir... my younger son-in-law's horoscope. Sir. Did you fix marriage of Kundavi after matching horoscopes, right? -Yes sir. Why are you asking that sir? Nothing... according to the horoscope your son-in-law has two wives. What's this shocking news sir? - I'm telling truth. In which world are you in? Hey, look there. Isn't he smart and handsome? From which state he'll be? Can't you smell the South Indian Idli sambar from him? I've come with my friend. Didn't I tell you about a dream boy coming regularly in my dreams? He's just like him. Stop lying. - I promise. Which school are you studying? - If you like him propose immediately. How can I propose in the first meeting? No chance. Look, boys get good girls very easily. But for we girls, no way. Excuse me, I overheard your conversation. Can I help you? We can take care of ourselves, take a walk. Coming forward to help. She's more beautiful than you, chubby like a Teddy bear, be careful. Will he be still alone without any woman in his life? You like Rajinkanth? - Rajinikanth? Did you see his face? See how happy he is smiling always. That means there's no woman in his life. Come fast... he'll go away. Come fast... he's going away. Please do something. Are you a Madrasi? - Yeah. Didn't I tell you? You want me to do anything? No, she's up to something. - Shut up. Don't put me in a fix. Come out clearly, he's asking you. - Tell me. I... please don't mistake me. No... no... it's okay, you carry on. I like you very much. So I love you & want to marry you, that's what you want to say, right? Tell him. Why is she interfering? Clear her out. Come with me. What do you think of yourself? Listen if you say anything... No... you've mistaken me. What? Are you in love with me? - Yes. You want to marry me? - Yes. She's good... tell her I'll marry her. Hey, stop shouting. But, there's a small problem. Tell me, whatever may be the problem, let's solve it. I've married only once. So what? Divorce her and marry this girl. This idea is good. Okay... okay. I'm also bored living with her. I'll divorce her. Divorce? Get lost. Will you divorce? Who are you? How dare you beat him? Are you bored living with me? You're telling this with some unknown girl. Listen to me. They just asked me. You say what's in your heart. What? So proud? - They just asked me. Just for fun. Fun... will you divorce me for fun? If any woman other than me enters your life I'll kill you. Hey! Rogue stop. - Sorry girls. If you see any girl I'll kill you. It's all fate. You went little overboard. - Poor girl. They asked if I'm from Madras. She was swooning on you. One minute. Tell me Kavi. Are you busy Gowtham? We'll get Ananda Vikatan here, I'll buy and come. - Okay. No... no... tell me. - Our Nithish... the thin guy... What happened to him? He has run away with our senior's wife. Oh my god! Very strange. After that... What did he do? - He's crying loudly in office. She'll be more than 40... No age bar for eloping. Who is it? Bloody... What man? How are you? Well gentlemen, as I told you earlier, European cars are the best in the world, what they have done on the European model is something fundamental, now, let's take a look at what they have done on the Indian models, as you see here in the Indian model cars, we don't have enough stroke length for the piston, and hence the torque and the power is very normal for a normal rpm, now what I'm going to do here is, I'm going to increase the stroke length of the piston, see... as simple as that, since I've increased the stroke length of the piston, the volumetric efficiency... This will not work in Indian conditions. ...the power and torque automatically increases for the same normal rpm. Well, that's about it, gentlemen. Sir, what you say may suit to your European standards, you don't seem to know about the Indian roads, and Indian attitude towards driving, for that we may have to increase the bore die of the cylinder, to get volumetric efficiency, power, torque for the same rpm. Was it you? -Yes sir. - Who are you? In what capacity you say this to me? Sir, this is Gowtham, one of our chief mechanic. Mr. Ranganathan, I don't need any mechanic to design my cars. You got it? I mean mechanic. Just ask him to get out. Sir, foryour information, he's from our side near Tenkasi. Do you want to fix any alliance with him? Send him out. Mechanic, know your limitations. We are not so foolish to take advises from a mechanic. Just get out of here. Sir, I'll continue only if he leaves this place. Sorry gentlemen. Leave me sir. Security, whose car is this? Remove it. Hey Mechanic! Come here. Father has come. What's it mechanic? You've come early? Good mechanic or bad mechanic? Good bad mechanic. I'll prepare it tomorrow, okay? Sure? What mechanic? Deaf? Why are you off the mood? Will you please stop calling me a mechanic? What am I to call a mechanic other than a mechanic, a doctor? Okay, hereafter don't call me like that. - I'll call you like that only. Mechanic... mechanic... I'll slap you. I'm just a mechanic not a pimp, right? Go away. Wait for 15 minutes, I'll fix your breakfast. Excuse me sir. - Yeah. Thanks. Let's try this in Just try this. I don't think this will go well... - Don't discourage me. - Okay then... Not yet started? Still what are you doing there? Buddy, I've to go now... Hey, what's all this? Why are you calling me often? Since morning, your wife called me several times. Why don't you call her back? - I'll call her sir. I'll talk to her. That's great! Hey, what are you doing here? Get inside the car. Please listen to me... It's raining. Get inside the car. You got bored living with me, right? There was a problem in my office... Come home, I'll explain it to you. Since morning, I called you several times... You didn't even bother to attend even a single call, did you? How badly you abused me as our child was watching? I just didn't mean it... - Don't lie. It wasn't like that... Mom, let's excuse dad this time. Mom, excuse him this time... Poor dad! Let's go... come on... Come on, mom. Listen to me... Dad, do I've to tell you separately? Come on, dad. They made me drench in the rain in their fight. Go and sleep without making fuss. Leave me... I'll beat you... leave me... Getting angry on me? Don't try to cajole me... # It's a joyful moment... # # Come on, my dear... # # Oh my love! I'm calling you... # # It's a joyful moment... # # Come on, my dear... # # Oh my love!

Shall I ask you one thing? - Yes. Shall we change this bed? Why? What's wrong with this bed? It's a big and comfortable cot, isn't it? Midnight, you're going away from me. I'm not able to get you... You should always be closer to me. I should always feel your breath. Shall we change it? Let's have a small and compact cot. Coming straight from Nepal, why are you killing me? Did you call me? Mr. Ranganathan wants to see you. Come... - What is the matter? Why? I don't know. Sir, did you call me? Please sit. - Good morning sir. - Good morning. What man? Excellent! You've made it! I sent your design to R & D. They approved it and sent it to America. They have called you there. That's it. Sir, when did you do all these things? - Just I sent it. Sir, give me your hand... thanks a lot. Hey buddy, thanks. Sir, you're great! I can't believe this! Sorry... Where is Kundavi? I won't spare him. Thanks... Hey dear... What? - A good news... I'm going to America for a Designers' meet on behalf of our Company. Wow! Congrats! Another important matter... I'll deliver my speech to same dog that threw me out. First I'll tell this to my father. Sorry... - Congrats. - Thank you. Excuse me... Do you know why we all have gathered here? Though my husband is good for nothing... But my sister's husband, my brother-in-law... Is going to America on a job. So, my father has decided to go to Bombay and give him a send off. Who else is interested to come with us? Raise your hands. What man! She is teaching a lesson? - It's good news, isn't it? Why are you raising your hand? - I want to go to Bombay. Look, she has insulted me. How dare you raise your hand? Put down your hand. Or else, I'll cut it tonight. Father, my husband isn't interested to come. Let's leave him alone and let's all go there. Brother, you've committed a mistake. - What did I do? Mumbai girls are fairer. If they see a black man like you... They will take you home & keep you with them to admire you... 5 days?! What are you talking man? First, reserve your ticket. I'll give you further details later. If I go and tell her, she'll think bad about me. You go and tell her. I've forced brother and he too has agreed to come there. Are you all happy now? No need to force or compel him to come there. Let him be here and do his work. Hey, In the interest of our family, a great man is advising you. Why are you opposing him? I'll also come there. - So, are you also coming there? Didn't I tell you I'll come? Buy a ticket for me too. Okay father. Count him also in the group. He will be helpful to carry this old woman. Am I here to carry an old woman? - Brother, you can carry her easily. One important matter... - What's it? You ask your brother in Bombay to give you a separate room. Only then, you can have great time. I will. I'll open the door. Welcome... I didn't wash my hand... Welcome uncle... Welcome Periyappa... How are you, grandma? Welcome... Hey, hold the mirror properly. - Hey, are you going to marry? Take off the hair from your chest. I can't bear that smell. Hey, come out... Why are you breaking the line? Stand in a line... It's like a queue in a ration shop. What happened? Some one is inside and not opening the door... Whom so ever it may be! When he comes out, I'll punch his face... Oh! It's our Vellaichami brother. Why did you take so much time in the toilet? Last night, did you allow me to sleep in the train? - For that? So, ljust overslept inside. Can't you bear that? Is this the place to sleep? Shut up! What's wrong in that? Two people use toilet at one time. Two people? How can two people use one toilet? Go man! You know only to make the place dirty! Brother, don't stop me. What did I tell you? - What did you tell me? Didn't you tell you'll ask him to give me a separate room? -Yes. Did you tell him? - Before that let me use the pot first. Brother, he wants to know where you've allotted room to him. Why? Can't he open his mouth? Since you've great respect for him. He doesn't wants to lose it. What man? What? It's very urgent and I'm controlling myself... Brother, it's me. - Is it you? Had you told me this earlier, I would've arranged a room foryou? Come on... Come with me. You should go to toilet only after getting a room. You had told me this and that and encouraged me to come here... Is going to toilet important now? I'll kill you... Sleep comfortably... Why did he bring us here? - I don't know... That's it. Leave some space... Brother, come on. Your room is ready. Sleep comfortably. Do you want me to sleep here? - Adjust and sleep. Brother, are you making fun of me? Didn't you tell me you'll give a room? Now asking me to lie down here?! They are all very bad people. If I sleep with them, I will completely get destroyed. Do you know that? Do you know the meaning of brother? - What? We have married sisters to become brothers. Is it? - Yes. My wife is a elder sister to your wife. How dare you behave like this with me? I've taken so much trouble to come here. Betteryou give me a separate room. What's your problem? Is it uncomfortable to you? -Yes. You go back to your place. - What? I said go back to your place. What is this brother? I just don't want to sleep here. Did I tell you that I won't sleep in terrace? Why are you getting angry? Shut up and sleep here, you idiot! You've made the toilet dirty and raising voice here?! Hey, Serve Biryani for brother. Shall I go to toilet now? - Get lost man! You stupid fellow! Sleep man. I'm getting sleep... Where are you going? Why are you stopping here? Is this the place? - Yes. Shake hands... Didn't you tell me that Mumbai girls are very fond of black men? - Yes. I've managed to get some money on loan without anyone's knowledge. It shouldn't go in waste. And I should enjoy it fully. I shouldn't forget Mumbai in my life. - Yes. You won't forget this place. I'll choose the best... Go... go... Hey, why are you following me? To help you. - To help me? I don't need your help now... especially here... Stand outside, you skin head! - I'll sit in a corner and watch the show... What! Is there any show going inside? I'll rip you apart. Get lost man! I say get out... Hey, why are you showing a long face? My happiness is yours. Go. Okay. You shouldn't cry... I thought of enjoying the show watching it, but you spoilt that also. Let your fun time turn into testing time, go man! I thought he will take me inside. But left me alone! Everything is wrong! - Brother, what happened? Did any snake bite you? It's double inside. - You paid for single, why double inside? I didn't mean that. This is different. Brother, what are you talking? - It's coming... Why did you come outside? Am I not beautiful? You get back Rs. 5000 from her. Get back Rs. 5000... Brother, they won't return money here. I don't want such type of women. Where are the girls of my taste? Get back Rs. 5000 from her. - Return Rs. 5000 to him. What Rs. 5000? Who gave me Rs. 5000? You didn't give me anything... Why are you lying? All of you come out... Oh no! All of them belong to the same group! Why are they clapping hands? This man stayed here for 3 days. He slept with everybody. He should pay us Rs. 50000. What is she saying man? I've forgotten the language. I'll tell you, sir. Wow! Tamilian! A person from our place! Tell me the matter. Since you've stayed here for 3 days and had a great time, she wants you to pay Rs. 50000. Oh my god! Hey, give my ball. - Don't disturb grandma... Father, did you call me? - Yes dear... Sit on the chair. - It's okay. Tell me... When is son-in-law leaving? At 10 pm. Are you happy? -Yes. I'm happy... Is son-in-law coming home correctly after office hours? -Yes. Why are you asking me that? I thought he will be busy in office. He won't work extra hours. He will follow office timings strictly and return home. This is the first time he is staying away from me and our child. That's why I'm little worried. Okay then. Carry on with your work. You haven't changed! Father, would you like to have coffee? - No. Okay bye... Goggle wearing man... - Yes brother... Come here... Hey, look at there... Here, Servant maid is looking marvelous. How can we remain silent? Is everything ready? -Yes. It won't go wrong like earlier, will it? - No way! Then do one thing... When my brother is leaving... Ask some money on behalf of me. Will you ask? -Yes brother. Brother... greetings... What's it? My brother, I mean your brother wants some money. Oh! Take this... What is this? - Money! Money!? Yes. It is also a money. I'll kill you man... Ask him a big amount. - He wants a big amount! Big one! I'll give you... take it. How much? - This is a ticket. Why are you giving your ticket to me? - It's your ticket. I'll buy my ticket when I go back to my place. I'm giving this to you before going... Here you have 20 tickets. My flight starts at 10 pm. And your train starts at 8 pm. You should start from here at 6 pm to catch the train. Take this and go back to your place. We've come here to give you a send off, but you're giving us a send-off? Uncle... - What dear? If you don't go back, who will they respect there? Sister-in-law, have you also started kidding me? We were looking after our work. You only phoned and called us to stay here for few days. Have you forgotten it? I said so a week ago. Now I'm asking you to leave. You... Bombay is getting bombed everyday. That's police force's headache. Why are you giving us a shock now? Then why did you call us here? I'll definitely book a room and stay here for 2 days. I know your plan! All of you come here. I'll go man... I'll leave this place. I've come to send you off but you're giving me a send off. Did you call me, brother-in-law? What brother-in-law?! He has asked you to go back to your place. Let's go from here. Go man... He may mistake me. Please convince him... Don't bother about him. You go happily. Son-in-law, I've kept all the things inside the car. I'll take leave then... - Happy journey. Even if I'm busy, you keep calling me. She will, don't worry. - Bye... Always playing... Where is your calendar? What's this? They've asked you to prepare an Insect box. Did you do it? Read properly... Parents should make it for children. That's you and your husband. Oh no! I can't catch insects in Mumbai. I can't do this! Otherwise, they will throw me out of the class. Then, I'll start playing games. What? Are you blackmailing me? I'm serious, mom. your father isn't here. Call security guard. You go, mom. If you want an insect box, call him. Is there an insect box inside it? - No. Your dad treasures all that he used in school and college. Let's try... may be we can find it. I'll help you. Security, don't put it on my mother's head. - Move. Mom, I'll cut it. - Hey, keep quiet. Don't be in a hurry. Your insect box! Gowtham, B.E. That was my childhood ambition. My role model was Engineer Raman of my native place. He wasn't a smart guy. But all girls used to fall for him. I liked it very much. So, I was also interested to become an engineer. But like other boys, I started smoking, drinking in my school days. And scored less in my exams. But I didn't give up! I forced my uncle and got a B.E. Seat by paying donation. Since I was from village, everybody ragged me in my first year. In the second year, I took control over my college. You're looking like a ladies' finger. How dare you bring boys from outside? A senior is chasing our classmate and beating him. Please sir... please... Please spare him for my sake. Hey, are you okay? Bleeding heavily. Please sir. Please sir. Amazing look! Hey, I thought you will rip him apart. But why did you break the bulb? She asked me to leave him, didn't she? Who? Mother Teresa. That girl... Hey, it's too much, man. You used to ogle every lady professor in the college. Now you're respecting a fresher?! Did you stop beating him hearing her words? Hey, catch him... Hey, stop... Leave me. We didn't stop you. Why are you showing-off like this? He isn't listening to me. He is looking at her only. -Yes buddy. Hereafter he is the don of this college. You should kiss his hands only. If we overrule you. Then you must offer me a beer. Immediately send this circular to the Principal. I like 2 things very much. One, playing football. Two, drinking liquor and having fun. Buddy, let's go to the hostel. Here... here... Stop laughing, senior. Did I throw up? No. Withdrew money from ATM. Hey, clear him out. Now, I've started liking one more thing. Faster... come this side... Buddy, got tired? - Hey, shut up man! Hey, hold it... - I'm holding it... First, loosen your grip on the brake. Ishu, don't raise accelerator Listen to me... - I know... Look, I've learnt so quickly. No way! - Don't shake, stupid. I didn't, I'm turning that side, you fool! Be careful... - Take off your hand. I'll drive myself. I know how you will drive! You may pull me down along with you. If I tell this to your father. What will you do? Hey... Let's go on the road. Got scared?! Got scared of him?! Is he a great man?! Don't over act. If he rules over there. I rule over my place. Just words! If he crosses my line again, then... Hey, buddy, what's spicy? Here I've come to give you a shock! Didn't get me? Will your father teach her to release the stand? Teach her properly. Hey Ishu, HOD is searching you. I'll go... Won't you greet your senior? You were sleeping. Even if I sleep, you should greet me! Come here. If you're an MP's daughter, that doesn't mean you should be arrogant. Come here. What's your father's victory margin? - 140004 votes How many bogus votes out of them? There were no bogus votes. Wow! Senior! Hey, Senior, what the hell are you doing? Lakshmi Mills owner... No... Supervisor... He is my senior. I'm senior, Anandha Narayanan. Hey, sit man... - Okay. Back to Pavilion. He wants a Supervisor job in Lakshmi Mills. It seems your father is a great man. Get a recommendation letter from him tomorrow. No. He won't do such things. You should come with the letter, okay? Senior, you didn't study well. Atleast you could've learnt to piss properly? If they offer Govt. Jobs to those who stand and piss, Then, I'll stand and piss. Move that side man. - Clean it man. Brother. Who's this? What are you seeing here instead of holding burette in the lab? Sister is calling you. If sister calls, ask your uncle to go. Why are you calling me? Not my sister. It's Ishwarya sister. Ishwarya?! What? Letter. Recommendation. Senior... - What junior? Buddy, I love you da. She is like my sister. Go man... go... Thank you sister. Junior, I'll throw a party tonight. Very good! You're obeying me. Go. Buddy, what is it in his hand? He asked for a recommendation letter. That's why... Whose recommendation? From MP MP?! Even a Councillor will recommend only after taking a bribe, But an MP's daughter is coming to you and giving a letter, so, what's going on between you? Tell me... Hey, open your mouth and tell me... If I disclose it, you will go to town with it! Is it an Ad to splash all over the town? Tell me buddy... tell me... She was pestering me for long... For the past 2 months... Wherever I go, she followed me... If I go to gym, she's there. If I go to a mechanic shop, she's there. - Is it? I was buying snacks from a shop. She followed me to there also. Shit! 4 days back, she was having handful of tablets. Vitamin pills? Sleeping pills! She said that she will die... How can I allow a girl to die because of me? Oh no! Police will catch you. You shouldn't allow it to happen. That's why I gave her permission to love! Who? - Me! Hey, This morning, I ate a burger from Nair's shop. It wasn't good at all. I'll knock you out man! PSB Coimbatore vs K.E. C Thiruchi. Beautiful pass... That's Gowtham... Star striker of PSB. That was a marvelous hit... Oh! He is rushing fast. This looks danger. PSB College hits a goal. They are celebrating their victory. Boost must be the secret of their energy. What's the use of playing nicely? - What man? Then what! Average girls are cheering the opposing team. Look at your girl friend... Eating nicely! We are all decent guys. Ishu, look at me. Look at me. Ishu, look at me. Ishu, look at me. What happened? Why are you running as if your wife has delivered a child? Hey, stop joking. I'm serious. If you go inside, all of us will become serious. There are many honchos inside the room. They are planning to ban football matches in Coimbatore. If they come to know that you hit the ball on her face. They will... - Stop it man! Give way to them. He is the MP. Greetings sir. I suffered a lot without seeing her for 2 days. Sorry. - It's okay. That was an accident. I did it purposely. Ishu, did that rowdy tell you that he did this purposely? Did you tell your father? - No. I'll tell this to your father and teach him a lesson. Peter, don't make it a big issue. Buddy, buy Cigarettes. - Shit! Can't you buy a cigarette? Why do you live then? I don't have money, buddy. - Sell your Kidney. You don't have even Rs.1.50 paise to buy a cigarette. Foryou, it's not wrong to lose a kidney. - Is it ready? Didn't I tell you that I'll go at 5 pm? Why are you delaying? You can go at 6.30 pm. You scoundrel! I meant the time! Has aunty left? Instead of this, you could've loved some girl. Hey, Love is like itching. You feel good as you scratch. But you'll get ugly swellings later. Buddy, look there. He's already deep in love trouble. Buddy, He'll go to toilet after smoking a cigarette. After that he'll ask something to eat. Senior is eying you. From now, your chapter is closed. I doubt you... - Hey, keep quiet... Something is on between you two. Tell me the truth... tell me... Hey, keep quiet... What are you doing? I'm going to spread the news. I'll definitely tell this to everyone. There is something between Senior & Ishu, I'm going to paint the town red with it. Ishu... Hey... Sorry... Are you a rowdy? You're behaving indecently with a girl? We shouldn't spare him. Go and see that girl... Sir, lorry... Look how innocently he looks! Why are you still standing here? Get lost man! Get lost, you stupid. Slap him. What are you looking at? Hey, get lost man. I became zero infront of her. Her cries were still lingering in my ears! My intelligence knew that there was another road. But my heart wasn't ready to accept logic. How can I face her? Ishu, did you finish your records? Sorry. - It's okay. I'm not able to concentrate on my studies. Give me a samosa. Ishu, one more tea. One more tea. - Okay. I didn't do it purposely... You didn't see that lorry... In fear... I tried to pull you... but your dress... and it tore... I'm a fool! I hate myself. I'm sure, you will be angry with me. Yes, I'm angry. The body which you should only see. Why did you allow others to see it? Hey, buddy! Why are you removing my towel, buddy? Hey buddy, do you know the news? Ishu said 'I love you' to me. You were saying this standing, sleeping and now you're circling me and saying this, how can we believe it? If you don't believe, see tomorrow's newspaper. I'm the happiest man in the world. Ishu was part of my life. She accepts me as for what I am and I like that very much in her. Hey MP's daughter! I was searching you all over the place. Come & sit here. - But where? Just for fun. Let's zoom around. Not now. Sometime later, okay? I can't find an auspicious hour to take you out. Come & sit. Please... A lover will love to take his sweetheart on his bike. I also love to do that. Stop asking for reasons! Stop playing & come. Let's be different. Not necessary... Ishu, I'll leave. I will meet you in the evening. - Stop. I'll also come with you. Let's meet in the college tomorrow. Where are you going? Gowtham, everyone is looking at us. Leave my hand. I don't care. You're my wife. Let it happen first. Now, leave me. You go. Gowtham... please... I'm scared of you Gowtham. Why are you so wild? You're the reason. Gowtham, please don't say that. Many people in the city know me very well. If anyone tell this to my father. Gowtham, I want to live with you all my life. Try to understand. Wow! Don't leave her. Keep kissing. You call this a kiss! When are we going to taste such a kiss? I think we may not. Go & romance in the phone. He was sleeping... Hello... - Hi! What are you doing? Gowtham... one sec... Why did you call me now? You are my wife. I will call you at anytime. O Yes! Tell me. I want a kiss. It's urgent. What was that!? This isn't enough. What was that? Hello... Hello... - Mother. Hello... - One sec... Now tell me. Are you ready now? I asked you for a kiss, didn't I? - I gave you, didn't I? What you gave me was a kiss! I need it in person. Lip to lip. That's possible only after marriage. I didn't ask for a baby. Just a kiss. I will give you. You say this always. - Okay. Listen to me. Get me a mobile & a sim card immediately. What for? My mother is suspecting me. If she complains to my father, we're finished. They will take my mobile. And all the phone lines at home will get snapped. How will I contact you then? You're right. So, we need a secret number, don't we? Only now you're talking like a politician's daughter. Ishu... You're finished. One sec... what's it mother? Why are you taking so long? Come fast. I'm coming. Hold on. - Okay. Come fast. Is this the only bathroom in this house? You don't know my emergency. Escaped. Hello shorty! Talk... When in college, you speak nothing. Hello... what are you doing there? Hello... - Yes tell me. Tell you what? Yes tell me. I'm in a... mood. Don't move around. The signal is getting low. Ishu, my lips have gone dry. My tongue has gone dry. If you could spare me your lips for sometime, I will live. What do you say? Sounds good. After marriage, I'm all yours. Do whateveryou want to do with me. For now, be patient. Okay? Till then, even if you try to seduce me. What then? What are you doing at this late hour? Go & sleep. Okay. Shit! How did he come here? How did he go away? Sleeping... # Come infront of me, O my darling! # # Come.

Dressed in silk sari, ...jasmine, you look pretty awesome. Do I look a groom? Looks like the bride isn't so happy? I'm happy. I know, dear. What's the matter? Tell me. Have we taken the right decision? I didn't take this decision on my own. Tell me if you are not interested. I'll stop everything. Your wish is mine. From the moment I fell in love with you, I've been living with you. Now I'm just going to sign. Who are they? Going with a harmonium box? He is the Registrar. She is an MP's daughter. The boy's name is Gowtham, and the girl's name is Ishwarya. We can finish the formalities. Are you college students? I told you not to go to him with your bald head. He's suspecting us now. Getting married before completing your studies? If they have to marry after graduation, it would take more than 40 years to clear all the arrears. You're very young. It's inauspicious time. Wait for another hour. I don't believe in that. Get it ready. - Just 1 hour please. Okay. We'll wait. He has started dancing to her tunes. Come. Is it tea beans? - No, it is a filter. Why is your face like that? Only coffee has beans, right? Get us tea first. Give it. How long will you take to make tea? Tea is free. Drink. How is the atmosphere? Give it to Geetha first. Careful. It's hot. It's not God's offerings, Ishu. Don't drink like that. Take it. Shake it. Place your hand on it. And just drink it in one go. If you try to taste it, you'll throw up. Tea at home will be strong. But here, we will go dizzy. If you don't like it. Don't drink. Would you like to eat anything else? Vadai? Get us medhu vadai. Medhu Vadai please. - Medhu Vadai? What is he doing? Wait. He has started to search only now. He will pluck it out from there. Hey, take your hands off, man. I think he will make us throw up. She once hesitated to get on his bike. But today, she has come to the Registrar's office. It's all because of love. Am I right, Ishu? I've been thinking about getting married in a Registrar's office. Don't be in a hurry. Better inquire with the Registrar. Usually they don't perform marriages for people above 60. Have you ever fallen in love? - Yes. But only I love. She is like an angel. She has left everything behind and has come with you. At any point in life, she must not regret for taking this decision. What are you going to tell your uncle? No. Even my parents wouldn't have given me so much freedom. From my childhood, he fulfilled all my desires. He wanted to conduct my marriage grandly. We'll go to him after marriage. I believe everything will be fine. Has your inauspicious hour over? Wait for another 10 minutes. - Why? Should the MP come here? If you are so clever, how clever should we be? I will do the formality of signing afteryour MP comes here. And now, we'll get married in the traditional way. Senior, bring the garlands. - The garlands are ready. Take them. Take it. You adorn me with flowers. You adorned a flower with flowers. You sparked a fire in the flower. Junior, give the auspicious thread to the groom. When you dance in the rain, I go dry. You flow in my veins & you are my heart beat, O my love! He wants to put all the knots. Friend... One. Two. Three. Happy married life. Ishwarya... You back stabbed me, you... Kill everyone. Father, tell them not to beat him. Please father. Father, don't beat him... Kill him. Please father. Leave him... Tell them to leave him. Come home. I will kill you. I thought my life was with Ishu... ...but I didn't expect time will put an harsh end to it so quickly. Don't strain yourself... nothing... please sleep. Have it... have water. I wasn't just in love with Ishu, beyond that I felt she was a part of my life. I don't want to live all the my life with her, just one day, if I had lived with her, I would've been content like living with her for an eon. But I wasn't lucky for that. Buddy! - What happened? - We searched everywhere for her. But nobody knows her whereabouts. What are you doing? - Hey listen to me. Buddy. Listen... be careful. No... he's still angry on us. - Listen to me. Please listen to us for God's sake. - We can see after few days. When? -Won't you listen to me? Son! What's that noise?! - Come fast. Can't you get down carefully? He fell suddenly. Go... go... call the doctor. Come fast... - Be careful. People say man proposes God disposes. God refused my wish but fulfilled my uncle's wish. He's not a human one who refuses the last wish of a dying man. I wanted to be humane. I decided to marry Kundavi. He died. 'Sundarakandam' comes only once in epic 'Ramayana'. Is my life any exception? My darling... my dearest one... Where's your mother? Mother... Is it? Come. Hey Dear! How's your health now? She's fine, just over acting dad. Shall we go out? Let's go. Okay, I've 3 hours work, we'll have lunch & dinner out. After an outing, let's do it at home. Okay? Dad, I and my Maths teacher had a fight. Dad... Dad. Yeah... yes sir. I just came. Okay... within half an hour. Alright... yeah. Gowtham... success. GM is waiting, I'll just get back to you. I'm very happy with you. - Thank you, I'll catch you later. Hey Rohit... be careful. Sorry... sorry... Where's your mother? No. Come to me dear... come to me... Okay... let's call your mother. Mummy, you're late. Hello... hey... Hello Gowtham, Neha here. Oh! Hi! Kundavi is busy in a meeting. Any important message. No, just tell her I had called. Okay, I'll pass the message. Bye. When did you come last night? At 1 am. Leaving so early? I've lot of work in office. Any problem? No problem, client meeting in Lokhandwala, we must fix the locations, madam is waiting there for me. Send Ishu to school. Hey Dear, wait. When will you learn to dress well? Everything will be alright. Go. I'll definitely come, don't worry. Bye. Oh God! Gowtham, I'm Nimmi. I'm Nirmala. Sorry... sorry madam. Even if it's kiss, so unabashedly. Don't know how Kundavi is bearing with you? Anyway if you're happy. That's enough. You didn't allow us to be happy. -Why? It's ten days since I returned from US, didn't even see her face to speak also, you kept her so busy. Me? She doesn't have any work in this office, she takes on herself to do other's jobs. She used to leave at the strike of 5, now she's refusing to leave even on my orders. Is it madam? Doesn't she have any work there? Gowtham... any problem? Madam... no... no... I'm okay. Okay, call me if you have anything. Okay? Yeah... okay. Bye. - Bye. Stop those calls and eat. Always talking on phone in lunch time. Mother. Mother, give me the disc. I'll give later. I need now. I want it right now. - Move aside Ishu. Sorry dear. I don't want. I said sorry, didn't I? Take it and play. Are you changing only channels? Will your father tell lies? Dad never lies, you tell lies. Me? You lie you've work in office. You know it. Does your father really love me? Shall I ask dad? Like all men he'll also lie. Dad. I've a doubt. What is it dear? How much you love my mother? Is it your doubt oryour mom's doubt? Mother's doubt is do you really love her? My doubt is how much you love her? Come dear. Come. I've stopped writing diary 6 years ago. I felt like writing after staying away from your mother. If she has time ask her to read it. What has dad written in it? New York city is sleeping. Loneliness was growing. Mist was enveloping. # New York city was sleeping. # # Loneliness was growing. # # Mist was enveloping. # # Boarding down from ships.

Ishu... give the bag I'll carry. I know what I did was wrong, but not talking to me is too much. Come, let's go in our car. Dear, I accept my mistake, you haven't talked to me for 6 years, that punishment is enough, listen to me. - Driver, go. I'm Kundavi, Gowtham's wife. Who am I then? Thank you. What are you doing honey? Door bell is ringing. What is she doing? What are you doing inside? Hi Gowtham. Won't you let me in? Come. Please sit. How are you Gowtham? Fine. How are you doing? Good. You... you... One sec. Leave it, I'll clear it. Someone's here to meet me... my friend. I invited her. Why? Because I love you. I love you. A day lived with her would've been like a life living together with her. But I was unlucky. You wrote this with tears. How painful you would've been through to write this? I didn't just love you, I love your dream, your desires, your feelings, I love everything. I want you too. I want you totally. Today your Ishu... Today your Ishu is here foryou. For today, I and our daughter are non-existent. What are you saying?

Where to mother? Hi Kundavi. Hi little Ishu. I got a gift foryou. Hope you like it. Say thank you. Thank you. You like it? It's just like you. Thank you. What's wrong with her? She's not well, running fever. I've to take her to the hospital. Okay, I'm leaving. I don't know what you've done before coming here? But I can guess you've done something really wrong. Ishu is not well, did you take her to a doctor? What happened to you? Why are you like this? Any problem with Gowtham? Oh No! Nothing like that. Okay, you take rest. I'll take Ishu to a doctor. We both will go to a doctor. Tomorrow is Deepavali, right? On the way back, I'll buy crackers foryou. Okay? Come... come. Good. Aren't you coming mom? Let your mom take rest, let's go.

Could you do me a favour? I need your bike. I want to go on a ride with him. I'll give it back soon. I will give you my car keys. Please... Come here. Why this now? I don't like to see you in formals and as a responsible husband. This is my Gowtham. Come, let's go. Wow! It was a dream to go with you on a bike. Go faster. Still faster... No one in Mumbai should drive faster than us. Do you think about me atleast once a day? Or atleast when you call your daughter? One beer please. Green colour beer bottle. Thank you. Earlier, you used to talk a lot. But now, everything has changed. Can you leave everything behind & come with me? I'll do that. Thank you. -Welcome. Have. Drink. C'mon. Have it. Gowtham, this isn't the way you drink. You do the bottoms up. Drink that way. - Now I can't. Can't you do it for me? Please. This is my Gowtham. I like that. Even better. Hey Gowtham! MTV Grind show in Mumbai! That too when I'm here. Please take me there. Yeah! Come let's go. Good evening everybody. Listen now, people on the floor. We've a surprise foryou today. We have a little draw happening here. For which... - Hold on your breath. You have to perform on the floor. And the winners are... Just can't wait to know who they are. I got it. Gowtham & Ishwarya.

Am I up to your mark? 50% Why? There is a big difference between present Ishu & college girl Ishu. May be you're right. Only my physical appearance has changed. Gowtham, my heart is still the same. Am I talking too much? I can't help it. Because I've lost many things. Oh sorry! I upset you. Sit... Sit... I've cooked all that I know. Taste every dish. Hope it will be good. Just taste and see... This is my special one. It's enough. You also join with me. -Yeah. Gowtham, don't hesitate. Come on. Gowtham, I can't forget this day! Say something. My time is elapsing. Please... Ishu, I can't forget any day spent with you. Ishu, will you forgive me? Hey, what's this? Crying like a child?! What did you do to excuse you? You took me to all the places. Beach, MTV show, restaurant, bike ride. Wow! In one day, you did several things for me. Do you know why I asked to take me to all these places? When I visit the places we had visited now, you must be seen there. I should live in your memories. I should die thinking you. Gowtham, will you give that right to me? Let's brake the silence. Hello, drive fast. What happened? Traffic jam. It will take some time. Where is Ishu? My dear Kundavi... I can't forget you in my life since you presented a memorable day to me! Thanks. When you left Gowtham to me, I understood the compassion in your eyes. You gave me one day to spend with Gowtham. But all we needed was just an hour! Silence for40 minutes. Formal inquiries for 10 minutes. 10 minutes to talk. He talked only about you even in those ten minutes. I realized how well you've merged in his life. When we fear of losing our beloved, we become possessive of them. We will be at peace if we realize that they're with more safer hands than us, I'm taking leave from you in that state of mind. In my next birth also, I should love Gowtham. Not as Ishu, but as Kundavi. Thanks, Kundavi. Where is Ishu? I want to see her. I've asked you many times. "Have you ever loved any one"? Such a big thing has happened. You never thought of revealing it to me. Gowtham, why did you hide it from me? Kundavi, a woman can tolerate anything, but can never tolerate another girl sharing her husband's love. I don't want to give you that pain. That's why I hid it from you. But you've searched that girl and found her, and brought her infront of me, at that time, I don't know, I became speechless! Hi darling! Look there! Mom, look there! Aunty bought me many crackers. I've kept everything down. # New York city was sleeping. # # Loneliness was growing. # # Mist was enveloping. #
