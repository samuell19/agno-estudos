I wasn't thinking about you. Starting that habit again? I'm gonna take Cissy back to Georgia. What do you mean, back to Georgia? Cissy's never been to Georgia. It's home. Cayro's home. I know I could... turn this around if I could get us all back together. Feeling guilty is one thing. Screwing up everybody's lives is something else. The only reason I stayed here after me and Randall split was so Cissy could see him. Now that he's gone... we got no reason to stay. Are you out of your mind? This is her world. What kinda world is this, Rose, huh? I mean, shit, it's just remnants of him. The worst parts of him. I always hated L.A. anyway. No, you didn't. It just isn't a place to bring up kids, okay? It just isn't. Delia, she loves it here. That is her backyard. This is what she knows. You-- you take her to Georgia, she might-- you might as well dump her on the moon. I gotta fix things. Oh, sweetheart, fixing things has never been your strong suit. Seriously, Delia. Those people are not gonna be happy to see you. They're not. Cissy just lost her daddy.

You and me together, out on the road, taking on the world. Stop calling me that. Put your glasses on. I hate you. I know. But you gotta wear your glasses, otherwise the light's gonna bring on one of your headaches. I ever tell you? The I-10 goes clear across the country. So? So, it's information, it's good to know. I don't know, I thought it was interesting. What do you mean we're not stopping? We're not even gonna sleep? Gotta make good time. Sleep in here. But... Carlsbad's really something. Daddy and I went there once. Slept outside. It was really cool. Was kinda like sleeping in space. You ever imagine that, sleeping in space? No. You know, I loved singing with your daddy. I loved singing with your daddy and Rosemary. But what I really loved was being on the bus, out on the road.

What, "Delia?" It's your name, isn't it? What'd they look like? Amanda's hair is dirty blond. Blue eyes, like her daddy. The way you got your daddy's eyes, the way you look so much like him? She looked like her daddy. And Dede's hair's-- was blond. Probably starting to curl by now. Dede used to laugh a lot. Amanda was more kinda, I don't know, watchful. What's his name again? Clint. What's he gonna think? I don't give a goddamn what he thinks. How old is everybody? Amanda turned 14 three months ago tomorrow, and Dede'll be 16 November 2nd. Oh, baby, what's the matter? What's the matter, honey? What's wrong? Hey. Hey. Oh, look! Look at that! Look at that. There you go! Excuse me, are you gonna tell me I didn't see that? See what? See what? You know what.

All right. Hey, your mama show you around town yet? No. Ahh. Well, we got a beauty parlor on the square, the Bonnet, Bee's Bonnet. I know, I wouldn't have named it that, but...

I don't know, you just seemed like the right... I mean, it's your job, isn't it, listening? Yeah. Part of it. I'm just surprised to see you, that's all. You've never turned to the church before. I'm not turning to the church, I'm turning to you. Is that okay? Oh, yeah. Yeah. I want my girls back. I wanna be with 'em... for 'em. I wanna make this right. But how can you make it right when you haven't even been out to see 'em? Cayro isn't that big, Delia. Everyone knows you're here. The girls... Yeah, they know you're here. They do? Of course they do.

You run on back to your granddaddy's place with your tail between your legs. Mrs. Windsor, I'm sorry to barge in like this-- And pray the Lord forgives you. I just wanted to say hey to the girls. Say hey to the girls? Can I just talk to 'em? Just sit with 'em? I need to see 'em, Louise. I need to see 'em. You been to see your husband? Cancer all through him. Dying out there alone.

They see him? I don't know if they see him. I heard he used to show up all shit-faced. Now, the old lady practically keeps 'em locked up. So... no. I don't think they see him anymore. What else do you know? Delia, why are you so certain that the old lady has custody? I don't know. I just figure she does by how things seem, how she acts with 'em, how long it's been. Mm. Maybe she acts that way 'cause she's scared. I really don't think she has custody. Why not? Well, I heard he wouldn't give it. You heard that? Why didn't you tell me that before? You know why. I'm scared you're gonna get hurt again. I wondered if you'd come. I want the girls. Did you hear me? I said I want the girls. What about my mama? She won't let me near 'em. Legally, you decide where they go. I'm back, I'm staying. I'm their mama, Clint, they belong with me. I need you to talk to your mama. I need you to do that for me. I don't want them living in California. I told you, I'm back, I'm staying. Where do you plan to live? Your granddaddy's? That son of a bitch. I don't know. M.T.'s? No. She lives in a shoebox. I told you, I don't know yet. I'll figure it out. I'll find us a place. He leave you money? How you gonna keep the girls, you don't have no money, don't even have a roof over their heads? You could come back here. Are you fucking kidding me? Why not? This is still your home. No, it ain't. It ain't been my home since I left. I don't wanna die in no hospital. I wanna be able to look out that window and see them fields. You help me do that, if you help me die here, I'll get you the girls. I gotta have custody. Okay. Official. Legal. On paper, in a will. You promise not to put me in a hospital, no matter how bad I get? Okay. You'll come home? Not as your wife. Just to help. And only if Amanda and Dede are here too, and only if it's on paper. Okay. I got my other girl. Cissy, she comes too. Okay. Can you, uh... help me back to bed? Louise. Jackson. I got nothing against you. We never even met, and I don't know your name. Cissy Pritchard. Uh-huh, well... I'm Mrs. Windsor. I gotta have words with your mama, Cissy. Would you go in and send her out? Delia, someone's here for you. How could you find a place in your heart to do such a thing? Me and Clint still technically married. Ain't gonna fool me with that. I'm not trying to fool you. What you done was wrong under the law and in the eyes of the Lord. We all make mistakes, Louise, and we live to fix 'em. They don't know you. They hardly know him. It's not up to you anymore. You just like your mama, aren't you? Fast and selfish, and filled with conceit. Look at you, making my girls swallow your sour resentment. You're gonna rot in hell, Delia Byrd. Then I'll see you there. Shit. Don't, Delia, don't! Don't you fight me! My mama brought the babies back, and what did she find? A dirty, filthy, empty house! Now, where's Delia? Oh, where could she be? Out fucking some faggot hippie freak. I know where you was, you skank-ass fucking whore. Oh... Oh... oh, you gonna spit in my face? I'll kill you, you fucking bitch. Mama's coming. Mama's gonna sing you back to sleep. No, Mama ain't gonna sing any more songs. You promised me in a church before God that you'd never be with anyone but me! I... I only sang one song with the man, honey. You know how I love to sing. Aw, dang. Where the fuck's my bullets?! Get back here! Get back here! Delia! De... Delia? Delia? Delia? Delia? You want something? I thought I heard you. Were you-- were you singing? No. Must've been your radio. Figured you'd wanna hear something except crickets and frogs out there. Yeah, thanks. See you, Granddaddy. Does he know you have that? He gave it to me. Jesus. All he ever gave me was a bunch of lectures and a few grunts now and then. You're the last person in the world I'd have thought would take to living with that old man. Every time I get used to a place, you wreck it. Yeah, well, I'm trying to fix that. Come on. Hm? Hey. Cissy, this is Clint. Clint, this is Cissy. Hey... Sorry. Here you go. Thank you. Hey, Cissy. Hey. So, why don't I make us some lunch, okay? What? Why does it smell like that in his room? 'Cause he's real sick and... he's gonna die soon. Sometimes when people are sick like that, it can smell bad. Thick, sorta sweet. Seems like a good guy. Nice enough. So, why doesn't anybody like him? I don't know how to answer that, honey. Did you like him? I used to love him. So, why'd you leave him? Aren't you glad I did? If I hadn't left, I never would have met your daddy. Never would've had you. But why'd you leave? I just... I just couldn't stay. Oh! Oh, dear Lord! Oh, look at you! Oh, thank you! You look so... so beautiful. I'm just so-- I'm so happy. I'm just so happy to have you here. To have you back with me. Ma'am, have you accepted the Lord Jesus has your personal savior? Oh, Amanda, honey, you don't need to call me ma'am. Why don't you call me Mama? I guess that's gonna take a little getting used to. Um, but why don't you just call me Delia? Okay? Is that-- that-- is that good for you? Is that good for you, Dede? It's fine with me. Okay. So... I'm so happy to see you both. Shall we go inside? Oh, let me get you out of this hot sun and... Cissy, honey? Take your glasses off, I want you to get a good look at your sisters. This is Amanda. And this is Dede. So, why don't we-- we'll go inside and we'll say hey to your daddy, okay? Just a quick hello. Okay? That sound good? Can you open the door for me, honey? Thank you. Cissy, you gonna-- you gonna come in? Good to see you girls. Sorry you got sick. You girls wanna see your room? Okay. I'll pray for you. I'll pray for you too. So, Amanda, Reverend Hillman tells me you're real active at Holiness Redeemer. Yes, ma'am. She's been touched by the Lord. How'd you get interested in the church? When my mother and father forsake me, the Lord taketh me up. How 'bout you, Dede? How's school? It's summer. That's right. That's a nice cat. Did y'all bring that from home? Yes, ma'am. Is it supposed to mean something? No, it's just a cat. It's nice. Hey. Y'all okay? Mm-hmm. 'Kay. Good night. Night. Wow. Smells good. A lot of food. A lot of food. Could-- could we just-- could we just sit? Just-- just for a minute? Okay. I know this is strange for all of us. But I think we're gonna be okay. I think we're gonna be fine. I think we're gonna be better than fine. You got anything to say, anything at all, I wanna hear it. I'm not leaving. That's it. Hey, Amanda. Where you going? Bible study. I'm on my way to the Bonnet. Can I give you a ride? Thanks, but I can walk. Please? I'd-- I'd really like to. I know you don't wanna be here. With me, I mean. I got no friend in fear. The Lord has me wrapped in His deep embrace, and the light that is His love shields me from all evil and harm. Okay. Don't worry for me. Worry for your own soul. Worry for the day you face Him and He condemns you to Hell for your actions here. I never wanted to be apart from you. I need you to know that. I wanted you with me every minute. I just... I just couldn't stay. But I always loved you. That never went away. You talk like love is something you choose to put on, like a sundress in the morning 'cause it's gonna be hot that day. That's not what-- That ain't love to God. And if it ain't love to God, it sure ain't love to me. Honey... what I remember learning about Jesus was He was about love and forgiveness. Religion isn't all fire and brimstone, it isn't about hate. You can't let the church or anyone else poison you with that. 'Cause baby, hate will rot you from the inside out, make you bitter and mean, and... you're too young. You're too beautiful for that. Next time you leave us, get yourself one of them talk shows. Maybe somebody somewhere might believe you. "And then you go home and find that people "you thought were alive and happy "were really dead and buried "while you were still two days out. "'It doesn't make sense,' he repeated vaguely. 'Jim, I think I want a drink.'" Psst, hey. Come on. Want a drag? No, but what if Delia finds out? She won't find out. I better get my glasses if I'm gonna be sitting out here. How come you wear 'em? 'Cause your daddy died, you're in mourning? Guess I'm gonna have to get me a pair of them soon. He isn't long for this world. How come you don't like him? Clint? It's just a bunch of bad memories. So, what's with the glasses? My daddy and I were in a wreck when I was little. Some glass got in my eye and cut it. And now, bright light gives me a bad headache. A wreck, like blood and guts, and stuff like that? Blood and glass, mostly. No guts. Mm. I don't remember much, except Delia being mad as hell. At you? No. Him. Did you like him? My daddy? Mm. Of course, yeah. He was the best. Even though he wrecked your eye? Come here, give me a hand. Do you know who I am? No. Hell, it don't matter. Ah, screw it. Tell your mama to have her folks send her junk over here. I'm too damn old to be hauling that crap around. I ain't no butler, no bellboy, or whatever the hell y'all say out in California. You can't do that. Why not? Cause it ain't yours. Sort of, it is. That's him. He's sexy. That's her. Doesn't seem like her... the way she is now. It's all that makeup. She's pretty. Hell... if I was married to an old dog like that, Cissy's daddy pulled up on a big old bus, I'd get on it, too. I wouldn't care who I left behind. Are you pissing in the water? I-- I can't help it. You can't help it? Is that all you have to say? I can't help it. Well, you couldn't help anything, could you?! Amanda, pray somewhere else, for Christ's sake! I'm not praying! There's a line forming out here. Leave me alone! Who said you could wear that? Nobody said I couldn't. Amanda! Delia. Delia.

Am I hallucinating or is this seriously fucked up? I know this is meant to be hard. I know that, but... all this time, I just figured that once I finally got here... when I got us all together, that I'd feel complete. But I look at them, and I see we're strangers. They don't know me. They don't need me. The truth is that's a selfish way of looking at things. I'm ashamed of myself that I want them to need me, but I do. I don't know. I don't know, I just thought it'd be different. That night you left... you were running for your life. So, you ran to someone who could shelter you. He took you in, and that's what he did. I could've run to you. And chances are I would've told you to stay. But I would have been wrong. Sooner or later, Clint would've killed you. We all know that now, including Clint. You took enormous, brave steps by coming back here and doing what you have. Like all of us, you want to be loved, understood, forgiven. I got no right asking for that. Of course, you do.

It's a personalized Calvary. I'm making it for Delia. Must be kind of difficult right now. It's a challenge. But we all need to be tested from time to time. You know much about your dad? No, ma'am. I didn't grow up with him. Grandma says he's lived a life of sin, so he's paying for it now. How 'bout your mom? Ever hear much about her? Yeah, I heard about her. Nothing good. Well... she gave you a lot of goodness when you were young. I know there's a reason for everything... a reason she had me, a reason she left, a reason she came back.

I hope someday you'll be able to forgive me. You should ask God for forgiveness. I have. Now, I'm asking you. This isn't up to me, it's up to God. No. It's up to you. I hurt you, not God. I'm real sorry, honey. You gotta take me with you. Cissy, you know I can't do that. You can't leave me alone in the middle of all this hillbilly crap. Let's go outside. That thing is sleeping in there. He doesn't care, he think this place is boring too and there's nothing to do-- Come out here anyway. I bet you never even seen the ocean. I seen pictures.

I know it's hard. But she's trying to catch up. That's not hard. Then what is? What's hard, Cissy? She likes them better than me. That's not true. That is just not true. You gotta cut your mom some slack. If she'd just stayed with my dad, none of this would be happening. She couldn't stay with him. She can't stay with anybody. She couldn't be a good mom to you if she stayed with him. He was the best. Your daddy... was a beautiful man. He had lots of gifts. But he wasn't perfect. Far from it. That's the truth, Cissy. Louise? You might wanna come out and see Clint. He's getting real bad. Got nothing to say to him after what he'd done. It might be the last time. I told you. No. Any time you wanna come out and see the girls, you're welcome to. I'm sure they'd like it. Any time at all. Delia ever talk about me? She tell you why she left me? No. Oh, come on, now. She told you. I can tell. She was right to leave, you know. Why? I... I loved her. Always had. Maybe I was afraid... she would see the... soft spot in me. I-- I think I imagined... she would go soft for me once I really had her. But... your mama... She's got something inside her... something hard. Strong. And... and beautiful. The damn truth is...

What? Something... around... me. You girls got anything to say to your daddy, now's a good time. What could we say? I don't know, baby. Are we supposed to say something? Only if you want to. I'm here. Delia... I'm sorry. I know. How long's he gonna lie in there like that? Just until the undertaker comes. Why don't we go outside for a minute? Just until he gets here. Okay? Did Daddy ever tell you how we met? Mm-mm. Mm. No? He used to sit at the bleachers at school watching football practice... laying back and smoking... looking real cool. Never talked much to anyone. He acted real tough just 'cause he was so shy. I used to walk through there on my way to work, and I'd be singing. I'd be singing real loud. One day, he called down from the bleachers and told me he liked the way I sang. And when he said that... made me feel real good. Made me feel like I meant something. ♪ Looking for something else ♪ Your high hopes ♪ Here I am all alone ♪ With too much of nothing to do ♪ ♪ I'm waiting for you ♪ I'd hold up the sky for you ♪ ♪ Build a bridge or two ♪ Let go of impossible ♪ You got nothing to lose ♪ ♪ Waiting for you ♪ Shoot for the moon gravity soon ♪ ♪ Everything is possible ♪ And it won't take long ♪ ♪ If you stay strong shoot for the moon ♪ ♪ You're looking for something else ♪ ♪ Your high hopes ♪ Here I am all alone ♪ With too much of nothing to do ♪ ♪ I'm waiting for you ♪ Shoot for the moon gravity soon ♪ ♪ Everything is possible ♪ I'd hold up the sky for you ♪ ♪ Build a bridge or two ♪ Let go of impossible ♪ You got nothing to lose ♪ ♪ I'm waiting for you ♪ So shoot for the moon, gravity soon ♪ ♪ Everything is possible ♪ I wanna be close to you ♪ ♪ I wanna turn to you ♪ And fall into you ♪ So shoot for the moon, if you suffer or lose ♪ ♪ I'll be there for you ♪ And it won't take long if you stay strong ♪ ♪ We'll shoot for the moon ♪ ♪ I see that you're alone ♪ I'll never leave you alone ♪ ♪ Find a way and take my hand ♪ ♪ A thousand light years away ♪ I wait here today imagine you see it falling ♪ ♪ Shoot for the moon ♪ I wait here today, imagine you see it falling ♪ ♪ And shoot for the moon ♪ Find a way and take my hand ♪ ♪ A thousand light years away ♪ I wait here today ♪ ♪ Imagine you see it falling ♪ ♪ And shoot for the moon ♪ ♪ I wait here today ♪ ♪ Imagine you see it falling ♪ ♪ Shoot for the moon ♪ Find a way and take my hand ♪ ♪ A thousand light years away ♪
