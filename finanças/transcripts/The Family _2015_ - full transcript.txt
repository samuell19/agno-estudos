You didn't cook the meat well. It's thick. Let me cook it again with more soy sauce. Leave her there. Let it be. Dad, this is Wang Wujun. Hello! - Wang? - Yes. Sit here, please. You sit here. I sit there. No. I insist. Wang Wujun, this is my mother. Hello! - Please sit. - Sit here, please. Mom, is there any food left? Just some duck eggs… and meat. - It suits. - Sounds good to me. Let's warm them up. It's ok. We give it. Do you watch TV every night? I like to see the news. Didn't you tell me he'd come here after dinner together? Otherwise I would have prepared something decent. Never mind. Wang, where do you work? I work at the Commerce and Industry Office of Yushui District. How is your job? It's not bad. My salary is about 3 to 4,000 Yuan per month. Health insurance is also good. How many siblings do you have? Four in all. Three guys The fourth is my younger sister. Is the number how many? I am the oldest. How old is your child? Study? You already have a job. He works at the university where he graduated. And where is it? In Beijing And your parents? They both have over 70. My mother is 72 and my father is 73. Liqin, do you want it? Its very tasty. No, thank you. She does not eat at night. Does your child have a home in Beijing? We are planning to buy you one on credit. It's your house? What have? Did you buy it recently? I happen to have two apartments here. My office build apartments with collective funds and sold me one at cost price. In the meantime I bought a new one recently. These two apartments. How much does your child earn per month? Currently about 50 to 60 thousand per year. You didn't get the job in a long time. Well, I'm full. Help yourself more. I'm full. It is very tasty. Very good. It's ok. Still have installments payable from your real estate credits? No. It's all paid for. I already bought them years ago. It is very spacious. About 140 square meters. Thanks. Help yourself to nuts. I don't eat nuts at night. Free refills. Wang is not reliable. He did not tell the truth. I still prefer the one from the Railroad Office. Your salary is good. Your safe job. And also has its own apartment. But he does not accept Pengpeng. Liqin has seen more than a dozen. Not satisfied with any. What the hell does she want? Liqin is not new and has a child living with her. It's not easy for women like her to get someone. I can no longer stand it. At school I didn't like to study, I just walked with guys. It passed with bad grades, I had to put a wedge to enter the Normal College. We had to pay the whole fees, when the other students don't have to do it. When you graduated from college, I got him a remote public high school. But she insisted on getting the job in a private school with your support. And the school closed three years later. So I had to use all my personal contacts. begging them to transfer her to this school, to have a decent job. It's easy to be wise after the fact. The private school paid more. And so. Who could know what would happen next? Besides, it's always the two of us Asking for help with your transfer, it's not just you. As for your old apartment, I told you not to sell it. But they sold it anyway without warning me, and bought this new one. The bank loan is hundreds of thousands. With its tiny income, she can barely pay the interest. And now comes the decoration. But where is the money? Again one more problem for me to solve. The new apartment was purchased before the old one was sold, didn't it? When buying the new apartment, Xu said he would pay the first installment. However when the time came, he did not get the money. But the contract was signed and the deposit paid. We had no choice but to sell the old apartment to get money for the first installment. I said from the start that Xu is bad. He is just talk! Nothing you say is true. I think of all these people, the Railroad Office is the best choice. I didn't tell you already that the Railroad Office… You don't want Pengpeng to live with him! Anyway the decoration… it will ultimately be made essentially by me. She has to work and has no time, and you don't quite know how to do it. I didn't tell you already that the Railroad Office guy... Who but me? You are not well. Don't worry about the decoration. If not me, who will it be? Slower! - Did you finish the TPC? - Yes. Did you remember drinking water at school? Yes. You should drink more water. See your lips. You have excessive internal heat. We don't want a bathtub. We want a shower. So a shower? Yes, a shower. "You want the toilet here, don't you?" - Yes. - This room is for the child. - To my grandson. I see. Then you have to have a desk and a bed. Right. And here we can make a little wardrobe. It can be embedded. No problems. This room is for our daughter. And we can just make a wardrobe here, like in the child's room. Right. Want the tiled balcony? Yes. Want a shower partition for this bathroom? I liked having the floor and walls tiled to the ceiling. And I liked a false ceiling. Clear. How about a partition in the shower to separate dry and wet areas? Right. That would be good. It is best to separate dry and wet areas. I don't want a false ceiling here. I prefer a stucco ceiling. How about a back wall? No, we don't have to. Maybe a false ceiling at the entrance? No, no. But a false ceiling can hide the beam. This area is for an interior garden. We want to make it an office. Now the kitchen. I wish I had a kitchen counter here. Well, it's better to be U-shaped. Yes. As for the sausages, electrical wires and plumbing must be of good quality. Of course! I can assure you. It would be a drag to replace them if something went wrong. Can be assured of quality embedded in the wall. How to designate rooms when kids Are you coming home for the Spring Festival? When they come back… Xiaomin's family, three, You can stay in this large room. That room... for Xujun and the woman. And the room beyond… It's for Liqin and Pengpeng. And we both? Both of us… We can sleep in the room. It's so good where we live now! It's much more spacious and comfortable for kids, when they come home. See that. So many people! Our house is also near markets, hospitals, train station… While here it is far from everything. When does the decorator arrive? - At 5:30 pm - It's ok. And what did Leilei get? - Tomorrow morning at 10am. - It's ok. I am? Hello! Is this Professor Deng? Yes. How are you doing! It's ok. Thank you! Bye. Who was? It was the Pengpeng Class Director. Pengpeng's grades have dropped again in the last tests. How much is the card? 20 cents for a pound. I think not. It should be about 40 cents. Prices have gone down. We are not making any profit. At least 30 cents! Let's see, how many bottles are there? How much is for a glass bottle? We do not buy them. Then take them. 2 Yuan for all this, all right? Is very little! At least 3 or 4 Yuan. That leaves me without any profit! So I don't feel like selling them to you. Do as you wish. Rice is not even worth the time you lose. Time is what I have the most. It is more nutritious than supermarket rice. So ask your brother to bring more, to make time! Liu, it's time for the ride! You wanted a duckling to play with. And I bought you one once, You took care of him a few days and then you left everything to me. I didn't like him when he grew up. Don't eat too much. It's almost time for lunch. It's ok. Put it there. Good, six dishes! It's a good omen for today! Pengpeng. Hand me a tissue. No, it's for you. It already is. - Did you just eat that? - I'm full! Eat some more meat! He only thinks about computer games! Never mind! There's only one day off all week. Why does grandpa take so long in the bathroom? Grandfather! Hurry up! Your mother is an English teacher. But you failed the English test. What will the other teachers think of your mother? You did well on the math test. Prove you're very smart. If you try harder, You will eventually catch the Englishman. You are five points below of the admission note to this school. It should cost about 6,000 yuan to get into school. Fortunately your grandmother is a retired school teacher and we only have to pay 3,000 Yuans. These five points are very expensive! Pengpeng, here is a taxi! Quick, tell him to stop! Why don't you come in? Go first. I wait for the bus. Crazy kid! It costs the same, with or without you! To ShizhengJiashuDaYuan, please. I am? Oh, Xujun. I'll call you back. Hello Xujun All right! Your father and I took Pengpeng to the hill today. It's ok. My lower back is pretty good. Your father… is quite well! It's Xujun for you! I was reading the newspaper in the room. Not bad. It's not too cold yet, it's good. It's ok. Hello Lulu! Such as? Yes, I can hear you. Account. Yes, I'm fine… it's not cold. The weather is good. I take the birds outside every morning. I put them next to other birds, and they sing together. … Yes, they still sing… Here are the phone numbers some of the decorators your father and I got. Here's a decorating plan your father made. If you have time, try to get yourself as many decorators as possible… to see the apartment and compare budgets. If you're busy, wait until we get back. Pengpeng, take a break! I am fine. Just a few more minutes. FUZHOU Mom, your slippers. Dad, here are yours. Pingping, grandparents have arrived! I'm going! - Grandfather! - Honey, I missed you so much! Mom, dad... why did it take long? The train was late. - Was Filled? - Not really. - Well, I have to go back to the kitchen. - It's ok. Mom, why are you here? Go rest! I can handle it myself. I'm not tired. Mom, you should go get some rest. It's been a long day for you with the train. I am fine! It was a cabin. This is also tiring. For me it's nothing. When I was young, I had a whole family to look after… the three Xiaomins and their sisters… and your grandparents. I woke up every day before sunrise, I made them breakfast. Then I went to school to teach. And I made lunch and dinner. She did the laundry when everyone slept. I could never go to bed before midnight. This to me is nothing. But then you were young. Mom, how's your lower back? Not bad. Your father bought me a physiotherapy couch. I do treatments twice a day… one in the afternoon and one in the evening. Help! Grandfather, did you bring me a gift? Here at home you have everything you want. Why do you need a gift? Where did you come from? From my land. And where is it? In Jiangxi. What happened next? You sure lose your appetite if I tell you. Now what happened next… Dad, do you want a drink? Your father no longer drinks alcohol. Seriously? A little does not hurt. So… the goose thought... let me say it sympathetically… the thing ahead… from the boy's ass… It was delicious. He grabbed it with his beak. The boy didn't run fast, but the goose was very fast, quac, quac… ran after the boy… so the boy was very angry and tried to hit the goose. The goose also got angry and continued to bite ... your little thing. It's very funny, isn't it? Dad, why didn't you bring the birds with you? We'll visit Xujun in a few days. There was no way having the birds with us. Let's eat. Hand me the chilli. Dad, drink it. Take it. Mom, eat. Let me get the gills out of it. Let Pingping do it alone. Mom, how's your sister? Your sister… She and Xu dated about half a year. At first she thought Xu was a good man… but gradually realized that it was a jig. Did not fulfill any promise. And your sister decided to end the relationship. It would have been before the Spring Festival. But he felt sorry for her living alone with a young daughter. I didn't want him to have a sad Spring Party, and decided to talk to him after the party… And it ended with him after the party. Someone introduced him to a man from the Railroad Office. It has a good situation. Your financial situation… Xiaomin, I gotta go. Director Yang is drunk again. Mom, go rest. Don't push yourself too hard. Why does your director use you as a driver? Drive carefully. Yes. They say that Director Yang will be promoted to Deputy Director General. Jiangsheng and he are very close. Yang can get Jiangsheng to become deputy director. That would be great! We would not have bought the car. Expenses are much higher with a car. More than 1,000 Yuans per month, only in gasoline. But Jiangsheng said some of his underlings bought Audis, It would be a shame if we didn't have a decent car. Good to have a car. It works. What 8 more gives 16? What gives? 8 plus 8 gives 16. - You should pass 1 here, right? - Yes. - And 7 plus that 1 equals…? - 8! Right, 8. What's 8 more 10? - 2. - Right. Fill the space with 2. and pass the 1. And 3 plus 1 equals…? Yes, 4. So what do we write here to have 5? - 2! - And what gives? We passed the 1 to this 3 here. Wait. Let me answer the phone. I am? Yes, we have arrived. This afternoon. Yes, we had dinner already. Your mother... let me go get her. Xujun is on the phone! Who is Xujun? Xujun is your uncle from your mother. It's your mother's younger brother, your maternal uncle. Your mother's older sister is your maternal aunt. Your father's younger brother is your uncle. Liu, are you ok? I am fine. Pingping, wake up! It's time to go to school! Hurry up!… Beautiful girl. Give me a helping hand. Hurry up, or we're late for school. The teacher gives you a scrape. Still with a cough? Take syrup for a while. Come on Xiaomin! Hurry up! You're late! You have to hurry! Mom, this money is for the supermarket. It is not safe to walk with a lot of money. Tell me if it's over. - No, save it! I have money! - Stay with him! How is the equipment in the back field? Something's wrong with machine # 2. They've already taken her to the workshop. What is the problem? Oil leak. Can this container be placed elsewhere? Yes of course. I'll tell the driver already. Today I became the most beautiful in my class! My Pingping is so good! But when Hu Linlin gets well from her illness, I have to be second again. Because she's a little thinner. What's good about being thin? Grandpa, you don't understand anything about girls! I do not want to talk with you! It's great to be the second most beautiful! Grandfather! Grandpa has been in the bathroom for so long! The grandfather is old man. It takes more time in the bathroom. - Hold on a little longer, honey. - It's ok. Grandfather! Grandpa is using my computer again to play cards! Let's talk to him! Liu, go buy steamed rolls! 3-2-3-4, 5-6-7-8, 4-2-3-4, 5-6-7-8… look right, left look up, down… You said you wanted to lose weight, but you still eat these things! My class's Lin Yusheng has won 1st place in the race again! Ah yes? He is not only good at sports but also at Chinese literature. Because. Your wallet colleague is jealous. Because you only got a B on exams, or a C, and Lin always has A. Many of my colleagues love him. Not even the kung fu masters beat him in sport. Wow!! Also good at sports! - Some colleagues even call him a guru. - Seriously? Yes, to learn kung fu from him. Does he also know kung fu ? But sometimes it punches others, otherwise it is cool! When your sister bought the apartment with Xu… He said he paid the first installment. When it came time to pay, he said he had not yet received payment of the project and owed to him, but that would be resolved soon. Your sister trusted him… and sold the old apartment to pay the first installment. Now came the decoration, but we don't have to get to that. Do you have any extra money to lend to him? It would be easier for your sister Get a mate, with the apartment already decorated. We are also with a tight belt. How much are you missing? About 70 or 80 thousand. What about Xujun? How much can you borrow? I ask you when you get there. - This hairstyle is very cute, isn't it? - It's cute, yes. With your face, there are better ones for you. Can I show you? In fact, this one gets you better, and make it more elegant and trendy. Do you like it? If you like it, I can show you how it looks. Is it popular? Yes of course! Lots of ladies choose him. It is the trend of this year. It gets very dynamic. That's right? Let's try? - All right, let's try this one. - Give me a second. Good morning lady. Sorry for the intrusion. I came to show my client the apartment below, but the owner is not there. The apartment is the same as yours. Can you let us have a look at yours? Just a moment. OK thank you! Jiangsheng! Yes? - What's it? - Someone is at the door. Good day sir. Sorry for the intrusion. I came to show the apartment below to my client… What selfish people! Never think of others! Mom, the next time you open the door, Make sure it's someone you know. Never open the door to strangers. So many bad people out there these days. "Who knows if they are crooks or not!" - All right, I realized. Why don't you stay behind me? So beautiful is his balloon! So… brave your hands! So weak your hands! You're messing with the wrong guy! You're messing with the wrong girl too! So horrible your mouth! Why don't you learn from behind me? It hurts nothing. Go there! You are so easy to deal with! He said: Of course I am. So simple your shoes! So ugly your five-pointed star! So small your head! You're so wrong thinking that they make me silly! So despicable! Look at him running! How can you beat us? We are much faster! You look bad! Mom, where have you been? - I called you so many times, nobody answered! - What? Did you call me? Of course! Liu, Xiaomin called many times, why didn't you answer? Oh, I didn't hear. How could you not hear? It was you who had the phone! "I asked you to give it to me, but you didn't give it to me!" - Let it be, mom! Xiaomin, I said there must be noise outside and they didn't hear it, did they? Next time I'll take the phone! Mom, did you bring the salt? Oh, I had a feeling I had forgotten something. What a weak memory of mine! I'll be back there. Let me get it. You've been on the street all day. You must be tired. Pingping, my cell phone. Mom, there were sales at the mall. I bought you a jade bracelet. Wow, it must be very expensive. You have no obligation. It was on sale, it wasn't expensive. Dad, I bought you a coat. It was also on sale. Out of season. I have many coats at home. I don't need any more. It's cold in there. Come on Give it a try. It stays beautifully. Mom, look! Give it back. They do not accept returns of discounted items. And it looks so good! Then give it to Jiangsheng. But it is not your style. The bracelet is sufficient. Let it be that your father and I return the coat tomorrow. Mom, did you bring anything for me? Hello Xujun Today is Pengpeng's birthday. Get a little phone call, okay? We're both fine. Don't worry about us. Bye. Grandma, sit up straight. She is your granddaughter, isn't she? Let's sit next to grandpa, okay? Beautiful girl! Grandma, come to them, please. Let's take the perfect picture! Who will you send the photos to? Your grandma, aren't you? Come on, joy! Let's fix the hair. Sit up straight. Arms relaxed. Grandpa, bring your knees together, please. Right! Just a little closer together. Show me your hands, please. Right! Well, now... it's your father, isn't it? Why don't you sit next to your father? Now, sit next to your mother-in-law, please. It's her mother! - I'm her mother. - Sorry! I was wrong. It's her father. Girl, let's straighten your skirt. You don't want them to see your underwear, do you? Go, sit right! Sir, can you please turn your legs out a little? Perfect, so yes. Let's go get your skirt... Great! Thanks! Put your hand on your mother's shoulder, please. Now, done! Grandpa, feel right!… Great! Perfect! Madam, look here, please. OK, let's go! Madam, fix your hair, please... Perfect! OK! Ready? One, two, three… Smile! One more, please! Perfect! Girl, joy! Imagine grandpa watching this picture. Wow!! How happy you'll be to see how you grew up! SHANGHAI Lulu. Go make the bed! Quickly! I'm going! Hey, you came back! Why did you take so long? Hey Mom! Dad! It's to change shoes, isn't it? Okay… let me put things down first. The slippers… One minute. Here they are! We just bought them. Why don't you sit down to change them? The chops are cooked in cold water. Put the chops in cold water… and wait for it to boil. Then pour the water. - So first scald the chops. - Yes, that's it. Then put some oil in the wok. Do you need another wok? All right, enough. Today I also bought a fish. How do you want to cook the fish? Um, let's steam it. It's ok. - Steamed bass is delicious. - All right, let's steam it. Hand me the other wok, please. Wait, mom. Let me wash it first. Take it. The detergent bottle should be there. Or the fire melts it. These are ready. Put them first on the platter? Of course, do that. - Then wash these, yes? - It's ok. How much is lettuce per kilo? That's 5.2 Yuans. Oh, cheaper than there on earth. - Seriously? How much does it cost there? - 6 Yuans. Can you peel the yam when you finish washing? Clear. We do not usually eat yam. They should eat more. It is very good for health. - Do you like scrambled eggs with tomatoes? - Yes! But I'm not very good at making them. Let me show you how it's done. Pour a few drops of cold water into the egg. Cold water… I realized. Mom, you got the phone ringing. I'm... Xiaomin! Yes, we have arrived. Good! Great… great… Here, your brother wants to talk to you. Yes, I am… She is also at home. Yeah, great... OK. Bye. Throw me a little. Take it. Better not give too much to the mother either. I should have cooked the bamboo shoots too. That would be six dishes! You forgot the cold plate. Never mind. Give it a try. It may be salty if you put it too much. Is it salty? Seriously? May not be well mixed. - It's really a bit salty. - It is? - To much salt! - Didn't you reduce? Even salty. You should have reduced. I forgot to reduce. - So salty. - Yeah, a little... but not bad. Eat with some rice. "I shouldn't have done it in a hurry." - It's saltier than tomatoes. Seriously? You know the algae. What a disaster… Salt is essential for flavor. No salt knows nothing. Then eat a salty duck egg to help. … As our team captain, Your technical aptitude is very low. He does nothing but pretends to be busy. It has not found real solutions to our work. It's only good to grease your superiors. However the Director likes him anyway. Why do you care? As long as I do nothing to harm you… Do you think he's really mean and greasy, but their superiors are not fools. I don't think they wore anyone who is nothing but a bootleg. He is really bad, professionally. Don't say these things to your colleagues. Or they will think you are reeling. Your temperament has not changed at all. This is the social reality. You should not continue to criticize. You should learn to adapt to society. And try to get along with others. Xujun is a man of principle from an early age. When I was at university in Wuhan, Your father had a meeting and drove there in the company car. When the meeting ended… The university vacation had begun. Your father told Xujun to come back with him in the car, but he refused, regardless of whether your father insisted too much. He said that the government should not be abused, and insisted on returning home by train alone. Wow!! Seriously? So selfless! Yeah, I was a bit naive then. However, since we are in the so-called real world, Why do they educate us differently when we are children? I am… OK. Lulu! It's time to wake up. Xujun just called me asking to wake you up. You're late for work. Wake up, all right? Mother! Yes? Have you seen my toothbrush? Your toothbrush… I left her here on the windowsill. On here. Do not leave the toothbrush in the bathroom. It is full of germs. It is not hygienic. Get away from the microwave. Beware of microwave radiation. OK. What is it for? I've been very forgotten lately. I have to exercise the brain more. Now let's go there. Let it be. Leave it to me. - Xujun. - Yes? You are now busy? No. I'm just watching TV. What is it, mom? I would like to talk to both of them. Clear. What it is? Well, it's been three years since you got married. Don't you think it's time to think about the next step? - You mean have a child? - Clear! Now your father and I We are not yet too old to take care of a baby. Why don't you have one? Our salaries are not that good yet. Not much left after we pay the home installment… the expenses of the house and such. How can we support a baby? No need to worry about the money. Your father and I have our reforms. Leave it to us. Mom, you and dad should travel with your money. You worked all your lives. Save no more money for Xujun. We travel every year. My school organizes trips for retired teachers every year. I can take your father with me. Who pays the expenses of the father? The school? The school pays most of its expenses. We already lived almost everything we had to live, difficulties and happiness. The only hope we have left is that you have a baby. Then we will be pleased. We would be so pleased! My current job is not ideal. I am preparing to take the Engineer Qualification Exams. If you pass, I can get a better job. I don't want my life to be like others, have very young children… and having to spend most of my time taking care of them, and have a life without success. I agree with you about taking the exams. But having a child does not affect that. Leave the baby with me and concentrate on the exams. Have a child? … What if my son becomes someone I don't like when I grow up? What nonsense! When you have a child, you don't even know how much you'll love him! Like me. When I was in high school, you remember how I treated dad, don't you remember? I don't even know how he could put up with me. If I had a baby and if, when I grew up, he treated me like I treated his father, How could you accept that? Do not be foolish! When children mature, they cease to be so! Look at you now. You're a good person, aren't you? But mom, we have a son! Of hand! Ah, it's also the nickname of Xujun! Lady, look at your grandma. Show grandma what you know! REAL ESTATE YIDA BICHO MAROTO WANG ALUMINUM DOORS AND WINDOWS NEW YUNFENG HAIRDRESSING DECORATION FUJIAN TOOLS BILLIAR YULE OK, let's arrange at 8:30 tomorrow morning. 82.5 cm. … And the height is 87 cm. Let me check it out. Madam, is it just this window? Yes. Want to take out this wooden window? Yes. There is an extra charge for removal. Extra fee? But you haven't mentioned it before in the store. Also did not mention the removal. So how much is this? Without removing the wooden window, 240 Yuans per square meter. Removal costs an additional 100 Yuans. It is a fair price! Both labor and equipment cost money. - What is up? - Nothing, it's fine. Please make a discount. The price is already very reasonable! And if you need a network window, There is also an extra charge. Make it cheaper, please. I have no scope for reductions. So how much is the total? If you need a network window… so 240 plus 100 gives 340… 80 more for the network window… The total is 420 Yuans. And what do you prefer for the installation, foam or silica gel? Foam. So that's 50 more Yuans. This is awesome! The price is the same everywhere in this business. The foam is more expensive. Okay, whatever he says. Be. Didn't you know there would be an old wooden window here? She didn't tell me that. The foam should not be included in the package? Of course not, it's an extra cost! How do you do business this way? Everything has extra costs! - It's common practice. I am no different! - It can not be? Go, make us a discount, please! It's such a small window… So go away! If not at the agreed price! Please call if you change your mind, ma'am. - All right, thanks. - Go away! We compared several companies this morning, His price is the lowest. You should not commit to these people. They are already used to cheating others. We pay. We already got the money. It is not for the money. And what's wrong with the window? Why do you have to change it? Don't get useless things to mind from now on! The window is out of fashion. A new one would be better… since the other windows have all been changed. Good, good… so be it. It should be time to pay the gas and light bills. Do not forget. How are Pengpeng studies going lately? Ask him how the birds are doing. Your father wants to know how the birds are doing. She says the birds are still alive in the woods. And don't forget to water the plants. The Pengpeng… still busy with your studies? Listen… for your english… don't forget to memorize words every day… and read the text aloud as you did before. As for physics and chemistry… you have to pay attention and listen well the teachers in class. And after classes, remember to do the review and the TPCs. If you have questions, ask your teachers for help. Do not be shy. Your class director called me yesterday. He told me something about you. Said one day, on the way home... did you see a man lying on the sidewalk with the bleeding leg. You asked him what had happened. He said a cyclist had shot him down and fled. So you helped him and took him to the hospital along with a colleague. You did very well! I'm so proud of you. It continues to do so. But you should be more careful with traffic on the way to school. You are fine? I am thirsty… Lower. Look, I made a hole in this wall. And the inlet and outlet pipes of the washing machine They go to the bathroom through the hole. Here is a cold water valve which I replaced with a T-valve, and installed a tap. The inlet tube is connected to the tap. Just turn on the tap when you want to use the washing machine… and close it when it's over. It is. - Really, that's all? - Yes. - Oh, so practical! - Not practical? Now the kitchen has more space too! I don't think Xujun thought of such a thing! He has so much to learn from you. Is nothing. Nothing special. Xujun is just too lazy to do this. It is really more spacious! It's always your father who treats of things like water, light… and these things at home. We never need to ask for help. I can see the mother's letters from here. Your letters are in sight. How are we going to win? You should hold pairs with pairs, and lonely ones with loners. I remember having one, but now I can't find her? A low pair? Low or high, I can't find it. But I remember having it. Do you have a pair of dukes? She has a pair of aces. I already saw him. On here! Yeah, I really have it. It's ok! Without hesitation! Step. Follow you. Now nobody wastes a pair of Dukes, even if they have them. One two three four… 4 cards do not make a straight. - So how many do? - At least five. Do you have any cards that reach a straight? One two three four… Forget it, step... - 4. - 5. Shackle. Now she got us all back to the game. Raisins? It's your turn! Can you beat? It's my shackle. Jack - 2. - Step. - It's my turn? - He already has only one card! Only one? Save him or not? Who loses must meet the winner's punishment from now on! You must be able to cover any card. Yeah. Well, the lowest one! - Not! I played a Duke! - All right, step. Raisins? So I won. Look at me! You played so badly! You shouldn't have passed. Yeah… I should have played… Wait! What's it? It was an 8. 8 is what I just played. It was a 2! - A duke? I can beat him! - But you didn't do it! All right, the past is gone. 10? Lady. - King. - Step. - Step. - Raisins? "Then it's still my turn." - I'll lose. King. So high! Step. Why haven't Jokers appeared yet?… Duke. Duke? This I do not step. I knocked! I pass. Step. - Shackle. - 10. No, mom, you should play after me. 10? Now it's me who only has one card. How many cards do you have? - Three letters. - It's mom's turn. Play or is it with you? OK, I play. Good lady. Step. What? Just have a letter? - I just told you. - Red Joker… a pair of shackles… I've lost. I still have a duke. It changes nothing. Mom, now you have to meet Xujun's punishment. You shouldn't have played pocket aces. You only had three aces. You should have played one ace at a time. The second to last also has punishment? Only the last one has punishment, doesn't it? IT'S. - First I give. - Right. It would be bad if you didn't have the punishment cards. No punishment cards, so no punishment. So you really lose. How can you win without punishment cards? Not forcible! You cannot play without meeting the penalty. Not forcible! Wow, very good hand! - You don't have letters anymore? - Not. What is the punishment letter? The tallest! - The tallest. - Do not hesitate. It is the tallest. No need for punishment if none of your cards is higher than a duke. If you have a Duke, then the Duke is for punishment. - What about the Jokers? - Of course they are. - If you don't even have a Duke... - Then you won't do the punishment. And I am the first to play. Well, I have a duke. Take it. - I'll give you a shackle. - Keep it if it's useful. Otherwise, you can return it. - Take a shackle. - Well, I don't want to. Stay with her. No, you have to accept it! No, she can refuse. I can refuse. - Seriously? - Yes. So he gets one more card! Yes, and one more opportunity. So it's the first to play, isn't it? No. She is the first because she has done the punishment. It does not seem reasonable. She can choose whether or not to accept your letter. You can decline it if you don't need it. No one wants to trade a Duke for a useless one. Assuming she gave me the red Joker and I returned 3 letters, She can choose one of the three. Is this really allowed? Clear… All right, all right, I accept! Accepted if useful, if not refuses. Oh God! It's ok! I said I accepted it! If you give him three cards, she can have all or only one. I accept! Do you understand? Why save it if it's useless? Dad, you didn't make that up, did you? Of course not! This rule makes sense. It is not fair to give useless letters to others. But that's why it's called punishment! No. If she has served the punishment, she has the right to… keep or reject the cards you give him. - I very much doubt it. - But if that's so. I also doubt it. That is the rule. Or is it unfair. The one who does the punishment loses a good card and receives a useless letter. What a burden! It really is a big burden for me! Right. The punishment should not be so severe. She already gave you your best letter. OK… OK. This applies to everyone. Then if you are to do the punishment, You will also have that right. It's ok. So let's play. 1 Yuan per 60 cm. It's made of ox tendon… Very good quality! Genuine beef tendon. The elastic is… This one is wider and the one narrower. How much is this? The same, 1 Yuan per 60 cm. 1 Yuan per 60 cm? 1 Yuan per 60 cm. And the elastic? This one? 2 Yuans per 30 cm. There is a needle here. Put the needle in here. Therefore… Here is the line. Pass the line here. And then pull the needle down. It is. It's not easy? Now remove the needle and it is ready. - Let me try it. - Sure, try it. - Step over the line here? - Yes, right there. Still hard for my eyes. Yes, remove the needle. Well, I did it. Okay, enough. - How much is it? - 2 yuans. 50 Yuans. See you later. - May I help you? - Get me two duck legs. 10 Yuans. - Excuse me? - 10 Yuans. - Mom. - You came back. I bought roasted duck. It's so big! Lulu is working overtime. It will arrive a little late. - What time is it? - She did not say. Do not know. But I don't think it will be too late. Well… so better cook the fish first. OK. The fish takes longer. Let me finish the broccoli. It's ok. Dad. Did you hit the wrong button when you went to the bathroom? The large knob is damaged and causes water to overflow. You should load in blue. I didn't go to the bathroom. Maybe it was your mother. Mother. Did you just leave the bathroom? No, I didn't leave. Because? Nothing, just asked. Do you need help? No. It's almost done. Go get some rest. We have dinner when Lulu arrives. It's ok. Dad. Was it you or not? Do not. The mother always closes the toilet lid. But it was raised. Who else? I! It was me! No mother! It wasn't you! You lied for something so small and you blamed it on your mother. For! - Do you think you're a man? - For! What's up with dad? What could it be? He hit the wrong button again when he went to the bathroom. The toilet overflowed. I asked her but she won't admit it and she blamed her mother. So I gave him a scrape. What did you tell him? That he was not a man for not admitting such a small mistake. How can you say such a thing to your father? That's what dad really is. He is always like that. Whenever something goes wrong, it blames the mother. When I was a kid, once he cooked steamed rolls. Her mother made him a bowl of salted water. He poured it all into the flour. Not surprisingly, the rolls were super yellow and know very badly. But when his mother asked him, he shifted that her mother had given her too much salt water. Yes, Mom had given her a bowl of salted water, but I didn't tell you to use it all. Before, when Mom worked at school, Teaching all day was too tiring. And I had to cook for the family when I came home. A hearty dinner at the table. But when Dad comes home in a bad mood, he can to turn the table without hesitation if she lost her temper. Even so, you shouldn't have talked to your father like that. I just saw him with red eyes. Looks like you've been crying. Mother father. - Mom, let's have dinner now? - It's ok. - I'm starving. - It's ok. Dad, help yourself to fish. Dad, let's play cards after dinner! No, not tonight. Go there, please! I was on my way home thinking about playing cards. And you, Xujun? Of course, let's play. Come on, let's play, okay? A pair of aces. - A couple of dukes. - Step. Can i hit? We are partners. You better not hit me. But if you can follow, force it. Anyway, you can't beat a pair of Dukes, unless you have a block. But I have a court. - But you shouldn't hit. - Because. You are partners. Beat it? Yes, I do. Okay, Jack. Lady. Lady? How many cards do you have? Two cards. - Mom, I pass. It's your turn. - My turn? Yes. She played a lady. - I played a lady. - Is the lady yours? You have to have higher cards. Well, let me see… It has to be a pair, doesn't it? - No. I played a Lady. - She played a lady. - She played the Lady, and you? - I passed. He passed. Do you pass too? And then this? - Good! No one beats? So it's me again. Don't play a pair, mom. She already only has two cards. - You only have two cards? - Don't remind her! But I have to, you only have two cards left. Only two cards… which card do I play? I can not choose. Whatever you want. Are your letters a pair? You might want to show them for ease. Well, two letters… - Can I play four cards? - Clear. So I play four cards… No, not these four. Or is it a waste. Mom, if you can win, push it. But she can win after I play. So give it a try! Not! Not! Don't play a pair! Leave it to me, mom. Your father is old. Don't be harsh with him. I know. I shouldn't have lost my mind today. I do not know why… He has a good heart even though he does not seem most of the time. He likes you so much from the bottom of his heart.

Liu… I think we'd better tell Xujun and our daughters. Look at you, why talk about this again? You want them to know I'm dying, so they have pity? Why do you think so? Zhao died shortly after two chemotherapy treatments… and suffered so much. If you had chosen not to do chemo, maybe I had lived longer. So let's talk about this with Xujun and our daughters and make them understand your decision that you don't want to do chemo. Do you really think they will support me if they know I don't want to do chemo? Do you really think who won't mind being judged by others? I am? Sorry, I didn't hear. There was a lot of noise downtown. Now we are on the bus. We already ate. You don't wait and you have dinner. About half an hour. Thank you! When I was at home I did daily treatments on the physiotherapy couch. But I have not been able to do it now with this trip. And yesterday I was out all day too. Had tried to end to make you dinner. But my back pains didn't leave me. We should go to the hospital. It is not necessary. I know what's up with my lower back. I just need to lie for a few days. Dad, leave it to me. - You'll be with mom. - Let me finish this. Let me cook today to practice. In addition it is for shredded pork with carrots. Here you have the bok choy to fry. It's ok. The dish beyond is already cooked. - How do you feel? - Very comfortable. While studying at Gannan Normal College… during the summer vacation of 1963… I went to visit some colleagues in Nanchang… and I met Liu, who was studying at Jiangxi Institute of Technology. Through the conversation… I found that it comes from good families, a good family of modest peasants. I thought I would also be an honest man… I got a good impression of him. Later we began to correspond. During July and August 1968… the government again gave jobs to the finalists of 1966 and 1967. I was detached teaching at a high school in Shangyou County. As for Liu… I had said something politically sensitive before. Instead of getting a job… He was locked in the corral and subjected himself to reform through work. During my work in Shangyou County… I mailed him 10 Yuans a month. My salary was 42.5 Yuans per month at that time. When winter came 1968… I worried about him a lot. So I excused myself to visit him. When I got there, he told me… "Forget me… I'll get you in trouble." His words touched me, and my heart ached for him. I made up my mind and said, "Let's get married now!" Then I spoke to the head of the Workers' Advertising Team at Liu's college about my decision. The head of the Workers Advertising Team told me… They thought, given the origin of Liu's family, that should be of a good nature. And approved our marriage. So we got married. February 1969… Finally Liu was posted to a job. It was in Southern City. In mid-August 1969… I traveled from Shangyou to Southern City to see him. You know, it took me two days to get there! At that time… I was already very pregnant with your sister Liqin. With a big belly. It's a long bumpy ride. I was completely exhausted. The delivery date was mid-September. Maybe because of the trip, I gave birth a little earlier, at the end of August. One month later… I returned to Shangyou for work, taking Liqin with me. About… more than a month later… I finally got a transfer to South City… and I joined Liu. At first there was no room for us. In a corner of the factory workshop Liu was able to build two brick walls… about 2 m high each and turned it into a small room. That became our home. That's where Xiaomin was born. 2 years later… The factory assigned us a thatched cottage with two bedrooms… right behind the factory. That's where Xujun was born. SOUTH CITY Room 607. It's ok. The room is good. Decent. Clean. Bed linen is also clean. DEPARTMENT STORE SECONDARY SCHOOL # 1 - Your nickname, please? - It's Deng. Professor Deng… Yes, I know her… Professor Huang, thank you very much! You're welcome! Professor Deng, when did you work here at this school? I got here… in 1971… and I left school in 1989. Yeah, that's why I don't remember you. I only started working here in 2007. Professor Deng, feel free to take a walk on the premises. - I have to go back to the office. - It's ok. - Excuse me, Professor Huang. - Yes? Do you happen to know Director Luo? Director Luo… I believe you died of a brain hemorrhage about 4 years ago. Sorry, I have to go. We finished the ascites palpation. Attention must be paid to two subjects. One is the food supplements and eat protein rich foods, such as meat, fish and eggs. The other is rest, do appropriate exercises and sunbathe. However, I still find it a shame give up treatment to Uncle Liu. The treatment would prolong your life, It would also relieve the pain. In addition, medical care covers expenses. Can you talk to Uncle Liu and make him reconsider? All right, I talk to him. What do your children think of this? We haven't told you yet. They are very busy. Maybe more later. After all, who has to make the decision is Liu. That's right. Uncle Liu is not well now, You should avoid getting too tired. Long trips like this should be avoided. Next time you have abdominal distension, come palpate ascites again, to give you relief. It's ok. Here comes the payroll! It's payday, beastly! Every month I look forward to this day! 2,320 Yuans, 2,130 liquids. How much? 2,090 Yuans. I buy the golden iPhone? If I could afford it? What a miserable salary! How much is yours, Professor Zhang? Take it. Look. Let's see how much we will receive when we are Professor Zhang's age. 3,290 Yuans. It's sad, isn't it? About 1,000 Yuans more than us. But I'm close to reform. Only 2 years left. Even street vendors make more money than we do! They can make hundreds in one day! In Xinjiang, a construction worker makes 300 yen a day carrying bricks! Let's all carry bricks. It should be us buying the decoration materials… instead of asking workers to buy them. They tell us what they buy is good and therefore more expensive. But then they use much worse materials. The price disparity can be huge. Tomorrow I'll go with mom… to the building materials market take a look. You shouldn't go around because of this at your age. I'll just take a look at this Sunday. You know nothing about the materials. I have to go with you anyway. We have plenty of time. And we have to take a daily walk to exercise the same. I was hoping your brother and sister would lend us enough money, but they don't do well in finance either. Xiaomin can only have 30,000 Yuans. The cost of living is very high where Xunjun lives. And it also has a high mortgage. I don't expect you to offer us any money. Your father and I still have 20,000 Yuans. Therefore the decoration will have to be simple. I see. Never mind. I just want to finish the decoration as soon as possible and change me. So me and dad We won't have to put up with much longer. You don't have to buy us more food. We can buy ourselves if we need to. We better save to Pengpeng College. I buy you food is not the same that you guys buy it. I fix Pengpeng. You do not have to worry. Then when you choose a partner, Don't give too much value to your money. Get someone who really likes you and treat you really well. We just need part of our reforms… for daily expenses. The rest can be for Pengpeng. How are things between you and Wang? We broke up last week. I found out you're very addicted to mah-jong and usually play out at night. - Did you wash your face? - Yes. What do you want to eat? Instant mass. Get away! You are intimidating him! - Grandfather! - Yes? - Where is the duck? - On the pan. It was grown. I will make two circuit connections. One is just for the fridge, and the other for all outlets. There will be a floor air conditioner in the living room. There will be a 4 mm diameter connection just for him. There will be air conditioning in each room. The master bedroom will be 1.5P. Those of the other two bedrooms of 1P. Well, each air conditioner will have a unique connection. For TVs, one in the living room and one in the master bedroom. Will there not be TVs in the other rooms? Do not. I suggest at least one more. - No, just these two. - Are you sure? - Yes OK. This is your room. The bed will be here… and a bedside table on each side. Here is the desk. The light is good. And the wardrobe... here in the corner. What do you think? Well... do as you please. Grandma, I would like to go now. It's ok. Pengpeng! Take money for the bus. - Be careful. - It's ok. SECOND XINYU CITY HOSPITAL Dad, where have you been? Why did you come back so late? Why haven't you had dinner yet? The food is cold. Let me warm it for you.
