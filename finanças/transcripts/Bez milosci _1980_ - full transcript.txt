Wait! Wait! Leave me alone! Go away! Please, leave alone! What's going on? Calm down! Calm down, miss. Why are you taking these? They won't print them anyway. I just like it, you know. You're going to get it someday. With bodyguards like you guys? - Any changes? - Unfortunately, no. - B14, come in, over. - I'm here, over. There's been an accident on Marszałkowska street... Copy that, I'm on my way. Let's go. Are you the owner of the car? - Your license, please. - Here you go. I thought it would be completely different... A week ago this sign wasn't here... Careful! WITHOUT LOVE - What the hell is this? - What, are they bad? Yes, I'm waiting. An oven left unattended has started a fire... A break in on Senatorska street... A tragedy in the Worker's Hotel... This is some heavy stuff. And yet you're still pretty. I do my best so you don't think you've made a mistake. I'll be over soon. Let's do the fire and the shop theft. But the fire needs to be shorter. I'm not interested in the rest. Don't you think the girl from the hotel is good? You always have those girly themes, this time it won't do. Let's go. If anyone asks, I'm here but not here. I'm afraid I'm going to have to rely on your income soon. I don't know if you can manage the two of us, especially since my tastes are very exclusive. I can handle it, stop being so dramatic. I have my ways of getting some free time. Take the keys and wait for me in the car. No way. I need some rest. Wait! I have a sad message for you. What, did your wife leave you? Because of you I had to get drunk again. Any reason is good for you. What happened? Tomorrow at 12.30 P.M., room 303. I got us the manager's suite. You know the address, right? You asshole! You should've told me that earlier. Take the keys and wait for me. Maybe... Maybe I should call my wife, tell her I won't be back tonight? A printing incident... No. No? You know very well I have to get some sleep. More importantly, I can't embarrass you tomorrow. Alright, then. I knew you'd say that. Yes, you always know everything. Good evening, number 27-16-54. I want to call Rome. Of course, but I can't reach them with the automatic one. Yes, 32-43-511. How long will it take? Alright, thank you very much. Not enough money, eh? - That's none of your business. - Alright, alright. Good night. Call me tomorrow after 11. Alright. I'll call you and tell you how it went. Oh, Ewa, Ewa... I don't remember scheduling a meeting for you. Editor Gawroński himself did it. - Have a good day, sir. - You too. Gentlemen, we have to check this. Good morning. My name is Ewa Bracka. Excuse me, I need to talk with the editor. - I thought we went over this already. - But I just wanted... Excuse me, I completely forgot about you. Come right in. Sit down. I'm listening. Well? Excuse me... I feel like I'm interrupting. Well, alright. I don't want to bind you legally from the very start. I think it would be best, if we started with a lump-sum. You've become accustomed to a very different kind of job. Getting used to things is as easy for me as changing my habits. That's how I avoid being disappointed. You finished studies in Rome? No, I studied for 3 years at the Warsaw University, and then I had to stop. But editor Gawroński mentioned something about Rome... I was in Rome 2 years ago. I worked in a newsroom. A newsroom? I had a great job. Better than a courier. And you want to work for our foreign departament? We have a spot in the social column if that interests you at all, get in touch with editor Kłosiński the day after tomorrow. - What did you get me? - Oh, my darling, I didn't bring you anything. Give mummy a kiss. I didn't get you anything. Here, give these to your grandma. Daddy promised to bring you a beautiful toy. "Horsey, horsey, take us far away!" Alright? "We'll ride into the woods, hunting for foods!" - What happened? - Grandma! Give the flowers to granny. Hi, mum. Here. - What happened? - Nothing... Come here, Magda. I just wanted to see you. I can't drop by in the evening, I'm really busy. What's been happening with you? I had a very intense workday at the hospital, - I can barely stand anymore. - As usual. I brought you guys some money. Here's 1500 złotys, you can pay for the kindergarten. Alright. I'll bring you the rest next week. I don't have it now. What, didn't he send you money? Are you joking? I called him a thousand times, but he's never home. Listen, I don't need money right now, take this back... I know you have no money right now. I have to borrow some anyway. Krystyna is coming to visit, I have to pay for the apartament. That's ridiculous, for you to pay for an apartament as if you don't have anyplace else to live. I've told you this so many times. I can't live with you guys. I have to be on my own to do anything at all. Is it someone... I'm scared for you. I'll be alright. I got the job, you know! Do you think what you're doing is okay? I don't know, but I have to believe that it is. Let's get some dinner together. Mum, will you join us for dinner? Let's go to dinner! 5 throws. Asia, raise your left arm! Move it, guys! More throws! There's nothing happening in the back line! To the left! End it, Ewa! Don't pull my hair! Pull her arm! That's right! MATE! Change couples. Get to work! See, I still got it. Wait a minute, you have to practice that more. - Let's work lying down. - Let me go, I have to leave. - Where are you gonna go? - I'll be back next week! Monday, then. I'm not in shape. Don't breathe. Wait. You can exhale. Listen... I think you're smoking a bit too much. I think that... ...you smoke too much. Is it over? It's all fine. You know... I'm really tired. Just prescribe me the usual. The last time I gave you those pills, you came back after 6 months. Ewa... You know you can never go back to competitive judo. These pills are for something else. Precisely. I need them for something else. I need to be as effective as possible. Do you think I can help you in that? I think you can, as you always do. Yeah... You're lucky. I can't talk, and please, stop calling me every 5 minutes. I'm working. Have you seen my black folder? Excuse me. I left it here yesterday. Listen to this: "...modern-day publicity, the air tasting bitter, a sour, distrustful look in the foreman's eyes that only from time to time betray a sliver of warmth." A fantastic piece. Get yourself together! I'll call you when I'm done. You came at the worst time. We're not always this agitated. It feels uncharacteristically calm to me. That's terrible. Please, do it again. - Or give it to someone else. - But...! Miss Bracka is here. Come in. Come in. Sit down, please. Chief asked that I take care of you. I want to find you something easy for starters. Why is that? You have to start somewhere. I've been doing "easy" for two years. No... We have quite the interesting piece about a certain company, but... - this is a subject for men. - That's perfect for me! Hello? I can't talk right now. I can't talk during... excuse me. Take the book. I don't know, go for a walk, call your mother. Yes. I told you there was no point in coming. Section 4 is completely unsupervised! - That's your problem. - What do you mean? You're the one who worked on the new shift layout! Let's not fight. You'll put Bukowski on the empty section starting on the 1st. I'll wait. The substation won't get the part on time! - Throw him out. - But sir, - I can't do all the work for him! - Then fire yourself! I wanted to ask for a moment of your time. Can't you see I'm leaving? Wait a minute, I've been here three times already. - You're just wasting your time. - Your secretary scheduled a meeting! I didn't promise anything to you. Can you tell me why your company doesn't finish work in time? This is not the place for this kind of conversation. Well, where and when do you propose we talk about this? What's the precise date of our meeting? - Do you have the Union authorisation? - No, but I'll have it next time. There won't be a next time. This lady is walking around the facility without a pass. Do something about it. I'm going to have to ask you to leave. Keep your hands off of me, I'm leaving. And in that same novel I read this sentence: „She opened her mouth, and a sudden explosion filled the air." Excuse me, can I bother you for a moment? - Yes? - I need your advice. Trouble, already? I told you to start with something easy. It's not trouble, it's not about that. I need a paper from the Union. Things like that are Kozicki's specialty. - When can it be done, sir? - We'll take care of it. I'm just not sure if the Union leader will want to help with that. - Maybe... - Maybe let's have a drink? No, thanks, I don't drink. - At all? - At all. - Coca-cola, then. As a gesture. - Well, I guess that's okay. There's a situation... Thank you. What's the occasion? Look at Piotr here. He's leaving us! Going abroad as a correspondent of the Radiocomitee. Congratulations. Although, it'd be nicer to drink to working together. You'll have your chance to decline a few pieces. - Where are you going? - London, most likely. I don't know the city, I don't know the language. I heard you've spent some time abroad, yourself? Yes, I've been to Rome 2 years ago. I know the city, I know the language... Piotr, your wife. Excuse me. There's trouble brewing. I've been waiting an hour for you! I'm going home. Leave me alone. Well? Were you able to get to that site manager? Excuse me? - Were you able to get to the... - Yes, of course. Get in, baby! Hello. I see you fancy yourself a burglar. It's you. Do you want to ID me, too? I have an authorisation from the Union. Here, don't you believe me? - No, of course I do. - Here. - I see you fell in love with us. - Oh, I'm crazy for you. Too bad it's one-sided. These helmets really do it for you. That's not us, that's the Design Institute. No one wants to talk to me like a person here. They make me go from the manager to his assistant. From the assistant to the stockman. And from the top. They made me look like a fool. So, now you fancy yourself a detective? I have to manage somehow. Do you know what they told me? That you don't finish the projects on time because you're missing parts for the cranes. Do you know what's inside these containers? I'll tell you what. I don't think it pays off, digging this deep. Write what your colleagues write. Write about broken windows, broken doors, broken handles. - Write about that. - You know what? - I'm going to take your picture. - I'm no good for that... An optimistic engineer and his construction site. I'm not interested in writing about the same thing others do. Even if I have to come here a 100 times, I'll get to the bottom of this. - Maybe you could help me? - No, I'm really busy. How about after work? I don't think you should poke around in here. Look somewhere else. You're on the right track. That's what I thought. Maybe you could help me, after all! She's ill again? Yeah, as usual. This is the front, and this is the base for the first... - May I? - One moment. The base for the first page, and this is the middle of the column. Now, go there and finish that title piece, alright? - What is it? - I need some answers. The man in charge of 5, in his 60s. His name is Szulc. - Szulc? - Do you have anything on him? I know nothing about Szulc. You're lying. I know you do. Honey... There are some things we don't talk about around here. Why is that? Because he has connections, his position is safe? Maybe you're just worried they'll kick you out? This isn't worth writing about. Everything is worth writing about. The whole truth, if that exists at all. We don't live in a desert. Don't forget, you're not working for „Corriere della Sera”, bella ragazza! (ITALIAN) Fuck off! You're forgetting I have the support of a very renowned magasine. Well? Will you help? I won't, because I know you too well. Besides, this issue is a mess. We can talk about this in the evening. The same place as usual? As usual. I need some money. Around 3 thousand. Do you have it on you? Until the first, as usual. Ewa! Have you seen Maciek's ball? No. I think it's in the dresser. Step by step, and I'll finally... take everything. A year ago I thought I should leave everything here, but now... Stop complaining. Is it that bad there? Everyone thinks that doctors working outside of cities make a fortune. - That used to be the case, but now... - Have you found that ball? I don't know where it is. Where did you see it last? It has to be somewhere over there. - Where, then? - I was looking for it. - There it is. - Thanks. And please, stop complaining. You have a happy family. A house, children, a husband, warmth. - Did you try interviewing again? - I don't think you realise the things going on in hospitals in Warsaw! They fight over every position, every internship, and you think it's so easy. - 'Cause you're doing it the wrong way. - What's the right way? You go there crying, tired. But you have to curl your hair, curl your lashes, full-on beauty salon, smiling like a model. There's no way they'll refuse you then. He's probably not at home. Hello? (ITALIAN): Hello! It's me. I called a couple of times. Yes, sure you're busy, but I have no money left! Magda? Still waiting. It's alright, I guess. I found a new job. In a very big newspaper. My chief? He's incredible. We'll see. Maybe next year. Yes, I'll wait. Bye. Kisses. Did he send you money? He did, the son of a bitch. I'm going back there for sure. You really want to go back, considering the things happening over there? What things? There's things happening all over the world. I'm a journalist. What could Fallaci do here? - Any ideas? - Not yet. I'm sure as hell not going there as a tourist for 150 dollars. I'm not going to beg for a donation from the Italian Institute. I'm not going there to wash dirty dishes. You still love him. Are you crazy? I need him, I need his money, his connections, the fire in his eyes... When I look at you... I'm never going to accomplish anything. - Alright. Goodnight. - Goodnight. Excuse me. - Is the board meeting over? - Yes. And it seems like they rejected something yet again. I'd like to get out earlier today. - You do it everyday. - Yes, but... Everyday you manage to sneak out earlier, you can work for once. - But Jola is ill. - End of discussion. Goddamn! Good article. It's really good. Where did you get all the info about the bribes? I have my ways. We have to fix the beginning. Cross out all the names, it's a piece about a situation, not about people. Add something to the ending. But every situation has a person causing it. I don't understand why we have to protect them. If you don't fix this by 4PM, it won't be part of the issue. We're not going to talk in this tone of voice. - Then I'm not printing it. - Then I'm not writing it. I'll give you a ride. - I heard you're in a hurry. - I can make it on time. Hey, Piotr, I heard about the decision regarding Rome. Rome. Ewa! - Take me to Smolna street, if you may. - Alright. Thank you a lot. If you'd wait, maybe I can fix that article. I live at number 25. For the first 6 months I lived at Via Cassia. Upstairs, on the left. Right next to the Palazzetto di Sport. Is that where they found that apartament with firearms? Then I moved to Parioli street. - It's a snobby neighbourhood. - Quite. But I ended up there by accident. And I stayed there for a very short time. I visited Rome only once. I must say I was disappointed. You have to live in Rome. You have to experience it. It felt very provincial. That's what all the intellectuals say, they find Rome's philosophy too simple for their tastes. Here. The meaning of life is to simply live. Live the best you can and at all cost. Well, now it's great. But it's not exactly the same. See you. I have some helpful papers from Rome. They could come in handy. Here. I don't need these anymore. Maps, guides, pictures. How long are you going for? - For around 3 years. - That's too bad... it was so nice working with you. I'm being honest. I need to leave, otherwise I'm going to lose my mind. It's the only way to leave this Hell of mine. It's so quiet up here. I can't hear the sounds of the city. Well... That's what the last couple of years have been like for me... It's the only place I can really take a step back from it all. I'll be taking these. See you around. What about this? Hey darling. I'm in a hurry, I can't talk right now. Call me tomorrow. Ewa! I've been calling you for days, you're never in. I was driving around, I'm really busy. Have you slept with him? I did, so what? You're even more cynical than me. Cynical, baby? I never promised you anything. - You never promised me anything, either. - You have a bad memory. You've forgotten already. When you came back from Rome 4 years ago. With an illegitimate child, a few dollars left. You were scraping the bottom, all alone. All alone except for me and that idiot doctor. But of course, I was your chance! You realised that. I could help you earn some money back. You're being dramatic. You didn't even have this in Rome. You bummed around... Leave me alone! You bummed around, after that dude left you with a child! They didn't want you in any newspaper, not even as a runner. Leave me alone! I don't want anything to do with you! Give me back the money you took from me! Firstly, I didn't take anything, I borrowed it. Secondly, I sent it to your office yesterday. Bye. Małgosia is right. The doctor issue is very important. Do we have anything else? We have the letter from that old farmer who had losses regarding the land consolidation. No, that's no good. It has to be a role model. Someone young, who finished their studies... ...and goes back to country life by choice. Do you understand? Sure. First we get an idea, and then we try to find a person to fit it. - But we have to write it. - Well, I'm not writing it. I simply can't. If you have an idea, take the doctor thing. But you said it yourself, it's... Leave the names and details out of it this time. If you have any issues, Małgosia can help. I have a great idea for all those issues. Hello? Hey. You were looking for me. Maybe tomorrow. Alright, I'll be right there. Can I leave? - Sure. - See you. - Don't forget about the board meeting. - Alright. Piotr! I was supposed to write the doctor article. Do you have to get so hung up on it? - You promised! - I changed my mind. You're losing your goddamn mind. She's going to write it better than you, end of discussion. You can write about the kindergartens. I told you to stick to the senior citizens. That's always a safe topic. Are you crazy? How am I supposed to return something I already swallowed? Don't tell me you bought all the receipts at once. - Of course I did. - What the hell?! At 3 separate drugstores, like you asked. I could really get in trouble for this! One man overdid it at some championship. There was a whole situation! Don't you realise? What's going on? You're being hysterical. - What did you say?! - Calm down... You have too strong of a position for anyone to even touch you. Are we good? I need to go to the hospital for 2 or 3 days. Think of something. Hey! - You were supposed to come to practice! - I'll drop by next week. - I'll hold you to it! - Okay! Good morning. Excuse me, I think it's starting. - We'll talk later. - In a minute. You have to pay your bill. - Of course. - I'll be waiting upstairs. - I'll think about it. - Alright, see you. Well? She went home. She's not feeling very well lately. Why are you telling me this? I don't understand it. I never had time to feel stressed. Just you wait. You can't avoid it with me around. It's okay. You won't have enough time. Excuse me... Today? Alright. We could leave together. Ladies and gentlemen, the board meeting is starting. I need to warn you, I don't have time to dream, either. Is Piotr Kłosiński here? There you are. Come on up. Ewa... I see you're climbing the corporate ladder. To be honest, working this long takes a toll on me. You'll be fine. Just press it very hard. - Speaking of that case... - I don't think we need to worry. And about that man from room 3... Write him a referral to a sanatorium. - Sir! - Yes? I need to talk to you for a minute. I'm listening. - Maybe... - Maybe in there. See, there was no need to panic. I wanted to thank you for taking care of me. You should be thanking doctor Jankowski, I did it all for him. I feel the need to return the favour. Are you joking... How so? What is this? What are you doing?! Wait a minute! Calm down. Thank you. This is my camera. Come with me. Over here. I thought doctor Jankowski would have told you that I'm a journalist. A journalist, huh? Well I don't know what to call you. We're exactly the same, you and I, except I do this for a right cause. Are you sure? You're not leaving the hospital with this. It's not a big deal, just a bait. You wouldn't want to talk to me otherwise. What else is there to talk about? I wanted to ask you about your pricing. How much do you take for, I don't know... pancreas surgery? I'm going to kick you out, I swear to God! No need to get angry. I don't have any names yet, no details, we can't write about that. You're aware that 1 in 7 people in this country is ill? How much, then? 20 thousand? 30? Maybe 40, huh? You think a human life has a cash value. But you apply one to it anyway, don't you. Give me back the film and get out of here! One moment. One more question. If a patient is to come here with no money or family, what do you do then? Do you just let them die? What value does their life have, then? You're too young to understand anything. Explain it to me, then. I'm calling the security. I'm leaving. I found out everything I needed. You can keep this. Publish everything you want. Don't be afraid. It's empty. Hello? Hello?! Who's there? Enough with the stupid jokes. (ITALIAN): I'm the Prime Minister. Interview me. "Do you think Italian economy to be fixable?" "Do you think the Italian economy is fixable?" - Why is that? - Just because! If you use pensare verb, you have to use the congiuntivo. Do you get it? Everywhere where you're assuming anything you have to use congiuntivo. If you have the dire verb, then you could use „e”. And don't say guaribile, say sanabile. You can guarire a child, or a person... For a situation you use sanare. Do you get it? „Si, si”. You and your „si” will take you far for sure. Maybe in a store, on the street, but in an interview? You'll be the one doing the interviewing. Yes, there's a scholarship for a trip to Rome. I heard about it yesterday. You know I can't go. Why is that? There's finally something happening. I can finally be completely self-sufficient. Didn't you say they want me to be present at the board meeting tomorrow? Do you know what this means for me? But you wouldn't lose anything by leaving. I can't go there as your lover. Don't say that. I talked to the boss, you'll be going as a regular Polish journalist. You'll work, you'll be a correspondent. I don't know. What matters to you in life? I told you once. Life is about living. Live the best you can and at all cost. Of course I'll come back for you. We'll fly above the world for 2 hours. And then a lady will come and say: "Fasten your seatbelts, please". And we'll start descending really slowly. And then the door will open and daddy will be waiting for us there! And he'll take us away with his beautiful red car. We'll be driving through a beautiful old city! So old, but it seems like it's the youngest city in the world. Our Warsaw is like an old lady next to it! Every city in the world is just a part of Rome. Rome is the whole world. There's nothing that compares to it. Daddy won't believe his eyes when he sees how big you've grown! - Really? - Of course! He'll kiss you, he'll take you in his arms, and he'll always hug you! - Really? - He'll always love you. Will you tell daddy to live with me? He'll love you because you're a good, smart little girl. You never cry. You're not afraid of anything. He'll love you, because... A person needs to be very strong to be loved. You know? Of course, if love is even real at all. These girls come here, usually from villages, because they're hoping for a better life. - A better world... - And they find it! Well, of course. Warsaw accepts any workers it can get. Pour me some, too. No one helps them around, no one shows them what to do, how to live, how to survive in a big city. They're all alone, lost, living in worker hotels. I don't know if you're aware just how many girls like that come to the city in a year. I think we should be talking about this. I agree. Ewa should write this. It's a good topic for women. I have a friend in a situation like that. She lives in a worker's hotel, she works as a painter. Alright. I think that's everything for today. Yes, that's all. Enough. I hate being patronised like that. - I wasn't patronising. - Of course you weren't. Are you still hoping to be part of our foreign departament? I try not to think about things I don't have. I think it's a brilliant idea. - We'll think about it. - You should. I can't believe you. She must have had another brilliant suggestion. We have no one but that! All of them come from villages, and every single one paints. But she stands out, she's blonde, with a braid, kind of shy. You mean Marianna Skoczek? I don't know, she has these big, scared eyes. I don't think her eyes are "scared". Well, maybe when she drinks. - What room is she in? - You're not getting in there. Maybe you should go for a smoke? - Here. - Thank you. Well, which room is it then? Simply put, they're prostitutes. I don't care, I'm a journalist, and I need to talk to them. I'm not letting you in there, unless you bring police with you! You can't go in there. Well, I'll be coming back with police, then. Hey. Do you know if Marianna Skoczek lives somewhere around here? Marianna? - Yeah. - Right here, why? That's great. Is there another entrance? - How can I get to you? - Come on up. - Through the window? - What else? Alright. Come on up. I'm fine. - Come on. - Wait a moment. Damn. Sit down. I'm getting old. - Here. - No, thanks. Seems I'm interrupting something. It won't take long. What do you want with her, anyway? Nothing much. I work for this newspaper. I wanted to talk with her about working at the plant. A journalist? Get lost... Did you hear that? Could we talk for a moment? She doesn't have time for you, but I do. That's great, you're very nice. Miss journalist... I'll talk to you tomorrow. - Or another time. - Okay. - Now, you're going to let me go. - Miss journalist! - Is he always this content? - What... I'm always happy! Well then, where can we talk? Well? Get out. Get out. I'll be back tomorrow. Okay. See you tomorrow. - I told you you can't go in there! - I'm not going in, I'm going out! Well, baby? - I'm hungry. - I'm thirsty. - Bring me something. - You bring us something. - You go. - No, you. - Bring us something! - No, you do that! You'll get it! I'm a scary... I'll eat you! Let me go! She's not agreeing to divorce. Does it matter? Maybe everything would fall apart anyway. Look at other people. - She says no to the trip, either. - What can she do? She can do anything. Are you insane? You told her we're supposed to go together? Yes. I tell her everything. You idiot! Hello? (ITALIAN): Hello?! Yes, speaking. What a surprise. I'm good. And you? I'm sorry, I'm really busy, I'll call you back later. Tomorrow. "Si, si..." Not too long. Thanks. Thanks, goodnight. Who was that? A friend, he was supposed to send me some books. A close friend? No one important. This thursday the board members met with the terror victims in Iran. It was a meeting with 1500 handicapped people. It showed the truth of over 200 years of imperial rule, more accurate than any document. I'm leaving for Tarnów. That's horrible. I might die from heartbreak. - Do you want to join me? - You know I can't. I'm really busy. Do you want your eggs soft-boiled or scrambled? Soft-boiled. (ITALIAN): Goddamn it! Editor! I'll be right there. Don't go there today, maybe some other time. I need to get this done today. Why are you so hung up on that girl? There's so many others. Won't you talk to me...? Another time. You look very nice. You can't go in there today. What happened? Is she drunk again? No. It's not what you think it is. How do you mean? I'll tell you myself. Later, okay? Hey. Well? Can we talk today? You have to tell me... ...How long have you been living here? Hey! How long have you been working here? Listen to me! You have to help me! I need you! I need to write that article, it's extremely important to me! Do you understand? Everyone has something extremely important to them! I'm so sorry. You have to go, they need to meet you. You're her mother. The teacher asked about you many times. When is it? Thursday at 5. I'm really busy then... Alright, I'll go. Does that mean you've found someone? Yes. Who is he? He's nice, he's good... I like him. I'm asking if you feel anything for him. Mum, please, don't ask me about this. It's my own business. Don't get so angry, I have the right to ask. Of course you do. Let's talk about this later. - I'll drop by in a few days. - Ewa! Yeah? Why did you write that piece about doctors? You know very well that during my 25 years of work I didn't take money from anyone. I had to write it. I'm sorry. Mum, I can't! I can't do it anymore! Think about what you're doing. Give me some more time. Mum. You don't have anything to say to me? I will, then. You drink because you think you can't do anything else. What do you want from me? How old are you? He probably told you you're a whore. That the child isn't his, that there's no way to tell whose is it. No. Didn't you know you can get it removed? - You're lying! - Did you think he'd marry you? - All lies! You're lying! - Why would I lie? You'd rather go back home to your village, wouldn't you? You know they'd kick you out. You're lying, you're lying! I can live all alone! I don't need anyone! What are you even saying?! They fired you! They're kicking you out from the hotel, what are you going to do? Live in the streets? You're making all of this up, you're lying, just so you can write about this in your stupid newspaper! You're lying! Lying! Why are you lying? Calm down, stop crying, silly. I want to help you. You have to tell me everything. That's right. You're not gonna believe me, but he really was my first. I believe you. I'm a woman too. You poor crybaby. Wipe your nose. Come on, sit down. I could talk to your superiors. I'm sure they could help you somehow. I've tried that before, they won't talk to me. Maybe they won't talk to you, but they will talk to me. If they won't help you, I'll find someone else who will. - We'll figure something out. - There's nothing to be figured out. There's always a way. Besides that... - I need to go! - Wait, please. Listen to me, just for a second! - I need to go! - I can't help you if you don't want to help yourself! - I really need to go! - I'm begging you, - do this for me! - I'll be right back! I'll be right back! Wait! Wait! Hello. Did Piotr... Did editor Kłosiński leave any materials for me? I need them. Maybe they're on his desk somewhere? So you want to come in? Yes. That's right. Go ahead. Here. Take a look around. This is his home that's supposedly a torture to be in. No way he could focus on work here... It's a nice place. But you see... A home... ...is not just fluffy carpets, soft chairs and paintings... Do you have a better idea for a home? A family? Here. You misunderstand me. I don't need your divorce. Well then what do you want? I just need you to agree for us to leave. Just that. I need Piotr for a few months, and then he can go back home. Safe and sound, and without me, of course. Maybe it will help him appreciate what he left behind here. Don't make this harder for me, I've been through a lot, too. I know for a fact that taking a break can help people get back together. Aren't you afraid I'll tell him everything? He won't believe it, anyway. You're even worse than I thought. Worse for him... ...better for you. Or the other way around. Which do you prefer? Hey. I went to visit your wife. I know. - Well? Are you angry with me? - No. What did she say? She agreed to our trip to Italy. Listen... - how's that girl piece coming along? - Pretty great. We're kind of friends now. Please, don't treat it so lightly. It could really change things for you. What, are there any doubts regarding my leave? No, it's all settled. But it's always better to... Cool, huh? Yes. It's a gift for my kid. Are you surprised? No. You never told me you had a child. You never asked. She's 4. Her name is Magda. She looks just like me, and lives with her grandma. Why are you nervous? Black, white, splash! - What is it? - I don't know. A nun falling off the stairs. Do you know this one? Why did the chicken cross the street? Jesus... Damn! Donuts! I'm all smudged! Maybe the other ones were prettier after all. No, these are really nice. Open up. Give me a moment. Hey! What's up? Leave her alone. She's moving out in a couple of days. Hold this. Here. What about us? Us? Wait, I have something for you. Buy yourself a beer. Get lost. Edek, get us all a beer! Alright. Come on, open up! How will I ever repay you for all you've done for me? I told you, there's always a way. How will I ever manage on my own? You will, don't you worry. You'll be living with girls only... You'll get a better job. And if you ever feel lost, you can always come find me. What about when the child is born? What do you mean? A woman can manage in every situation! Come on, let's unload this. Okay. I wanted to ask you for one thing. You have to leave all of this behind. You have to have respect for yourself. Do you understand me? Miss Ewa... Do you have to write that article about me? If anyone from my village heard about all this - I could never go back there. - I'm not writing about you. I'm writing about girls like you, with similar problems. It's for your own good. He's gone. Good for you. I was 19, just like you are now. 3 years of studying at a University, and then that trip, that... ...lasted a bit too long. I thought, "this must be what Heaven is like". Trips to Frascati, drinking wine in Castelli Romani, Sorrento, Capri... A great guy, the chief editor of a renowned italian newspaper. "Amore mio, amore mio"... Fix the focus. When he heard I was pregnant, he simply kicked me out. And from the newspaper where I was allowed to post little pieces from time to time. Do you really think anyone helped me then? I thrashed around Rome all alone. I waited for him for hours on end in front of the Parioli house, waited for his phonecall, and I drank. That's all I could do back then: drink and cry. Just like you're doing now. And then he gave me some money so I'd leave him alone, and I traveled back home with a baby in my belly. Look. I couldn't even manage to do that back then. Yeah... Hey, lighten up! I'm going to go now. So your child is over there? Do you like it? It's lovely. Let me see. Very nice. Here you go, it's yours now. - I couldn't possibly...! - I'm sure it will be useful. If you ever need anything, call me or drop by, but call me first, to make sure I'll be home. Thank you. Miss Ewa... Can I see your child? Another time, okay? Wait. Take this. I'll pack this for you. Miss... Were you this unhappy, too? Of course I was... It'll all go away with time. - Here you go. - Thank you. - Good-bye. - Bye. - Are you ready? - You're late. Of course I'm ready. Any news about the grant? Not yet. - Let me know by tomorrow. - Okay. I'm sorry, my name is Bracka. Do you remember me? The board hasn't decided yet. - Can you tell me who's call it is? - You see... You don't really have enough achievements. Mister Kosiński submitted an excellent assessment of your work... - Kłosiński. - Kłosiński, yes. He submitted an assessment, but there's still the qualification board, and they only care about your achievements. But I'm actually submitting a really big article in the next issue. Unless that turns out to be completely genius... I'm not sure about that, but it's the issue's leading article. Okay, I'll put in a good word for you. If there's any trouble, I mean any issues at all, call me, alright? - Alright. - This is my number. You're here at work everyday, right? Of course, but... this is my house number. Do number one like this: put this text here, put Ewa's article here, and the picture over here. I don't have any good pictures for this article. - You must have something. - No, this is not good enough. - This won't do at all. - Look at it. - It's complete trash. - Hopeless. What, you're going to show a naked girl? - Hang it on your wall. - Maybe you've got something? - You hang it on your wall! - No. Such a basic photo for this article! Well, no picture, then. But the 1st section needs a picture. What do you propose instead of the photo? What should I put there? Maybe the article about the competition? Come on, you must be joking. That's not good enough! This all makes zero sense. Put it on page three. - Here we go. - That's better. We're changing everything, let's cut Ewa's article, give Marek's correspondence here, put that here, and I need a picture still. I'll try to do something. Piotr, I can find something at my place, I have some photos left from Rome. You do? That's great. It's 1 P.M. I need a picture from you in 3 hours, you as well. - But it has to be vertical. - Has to be. Hey. Good morning. The new issue is out! Ewa Bracka: "Real life". Make one for me. For me as well, okay? You changed the layout after all? Is this the girl I saw in your apartament? - Is it that Marianna from the hotel? - No. - Yes? - No. Don't play dumb, I remember her. What if it is her? Don't you know you can't do things like that? - What if she sees it? - Come on, I know these girls, they don't read newspapers, especially ones like this. You just can't treat a person like that. That's immoral. What? What's immoral?! I'm not interested in a single person! I think one person can be sacrificed, that they should be sacrificed for greater good! - For the story! - Calm down! Why should I? These are your words: "People don't matter, only their stories". You think only stories matter, but people need to be protected, but I think that the stories matter more, and for the sake of a story one needs to sacrifice people. Do you like this picture? This is the girl from the worker's hotel, the one this article is about. Piotr thinks I shouldn't have printed the photo, but this way I helped hundreds of girls like her. And I think it's necessary, real and moral. I'm waiting for you at home tonight. See you. Well, well. You know... it's not over yet. I could tell you something else. Excuse me. What am I supposed to do with my leg then? - Hey, girls. - Hey. You need to raise it high, you have better momentum then. - I'll go in first, okay? - Hey, wait! - Wait a minute! - I was here first! Did you see that? She always cuts in like that... Excuse me, is doctor Jankowski here? He doesn't work here anymore. Oh... Excuse me. The boss is out. Come back in an hour. Do you know what he needed? He said he wanted to see me. That girl... ...committed suicide. Marianna... ...is dead? I head they cut her down from a string in the worker's hotel. Excuse me. Hey, baby! I'm so glad I found you. I wanted to know... Can you tell me what happened? I waited a whole day for you! Enough with the jokes! I don't even know if she's alive. Can you tell me? That's going to stay with you your whole life. Look at me, what are you saying?! Are you telling me she's really dead?! - You... - What? - How much are they paying you? - Leave me alone. Stop joking around. No more jokes. Just tell me if she's alive. I'll tell you. Can you see that? I should have used it on you the first time you came. Stop joking around! - I'm not joking. - No? Are you going to tell me now? You bitch! - You can play this game after all. - Jesus. Let me go! Take this! You bitch! You again? I'm sorry, I called you a couple of times, but no one answered. I need to see Piotr. You think he's here? It's really important, I need to speak with him. You wanted to tell him that you need him, - that he'll be back safe and sound... - That's not true. Listen to me! - Listen, I need to talk to him! - That it's only a couple of months! Please, stop! You don't understand... That you only need a green-light for your trip, yeah? All of this doesn't matter anymore, please, I need to talk to him! Okay, I'll tell him. Tell him I'm waiting for him at the club. Excuse me. - Hey, Ewa. Come over here. - Give me a moment. - Was he here? - No, he wasn't. - Are you sure? - I'm sure. - Maybe he'll drop by! - Or maybe he won't! If you'd be so kind to join us for a glass of vodka... - No, I... - Here you go. It's a must! I called you a couple of times. You weren't home, unfortunately. Consider me absent from here, as well. I called you regarding that grant... The board decided not to give it to you. I guess you had an enemy there, after all. Sir... ...pour one for me. Here you go. One more. Piotr! Piotr. Good evening, kind sir. My wife told me you were looking for me. I heard you wanted to talk. Although, I can see you're currently unable to speak. Please, I'm begging you don't go! I've been looking for you all day long! I need you! - You always needed me for something. - That's not true! Am I wrong?! Piotr! I'm begging you! Don't leave me here alone, none of this matters! Piotr! Hopeless. I'll be ready in a moment! Marianna... it's me... - Whose are you? - Mum's. You wanted to see her, so... I thought you'd be happy. What a pretty girl. What's your name? Magda Bracka-Armelini. Very nice. I was here a couple of times, but... You didn't want to see me. At first I didn't. Now I don't care. Marianna, listen... I know I've hurt you. I really didn't mean to. I wanted to help. I didn't think you'd take it so hard. No need to make excuses. I should be grateful to you. You've taught me a lot. Don't say that. I want to fix this somehow. You see, the problem is... I really don't need anyone. He brought me flowers. I don't really know why. Please... Don't talk to me like this. You're angry because they fired you because of that article? Because of me? That's not what this is about. Don't you worry. It'll all work out fine. There's always a way. Okay? Let's go. Marianna, listen, I thought that maybe, even after everything, you wanted to spend some time with me and my kid. You know I'll never be able to have children. It's better. I can survive better on my own. Lighten up!
