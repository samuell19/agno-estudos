STEVE YOUNG: None of this should have happened. I shouldn't know about it. This stuff is bizarre and hilarious. Those are only the beginning layers. We were not supposed to hear these songs. We were not supposed to see these productions. It was supposed to be all thrown away and forgotten.

So right now, three elements? -Uh, yeah, closing on Cher. -Okay. Okay. And does Cher require a special cue? Or is it just from off the previous stage joke? She's just cued off the Kim Kardashian joke. "Wound clear around her ass." Okay. STEVE: I feel like industrial musicals kind of chose me. It just kind of crossed my path, and I seemed to be the right person at the right time in history to latch onto this. The joke preceding that is, uh, one you have on your page about Kim Kardashian, uh... "Big line for the... for the book. Uh, the line wound clear around her ass." - WOMAN: I like your tie. STEVE: Yep. So I'm gonna double- and triple-check that, but that seems to be where we landed. All right, thank you. ANNOUNCER: From the heart of Broadway, broadcasting across the nation and around the world, it's the Late Show with David Letterman. LEE ELLENBERG: Steve kind of is the voice of the show. Uh, I mean, obviously Dave is the voice of the show, but Steve has been around as a writer longer than anybody else. I consider Steve to be the last vestige of the heyday of late-night talk show television writers. There are precious few of these men and women who can do this. -ELLENBERG: All right. -WEINER: Do we just have him - groan a little bit, like... -Yeah. Should we put that line earlier on? 'Cause I think that's funny that he has -a compound fracture. -Sure. ELLENBERG: When you're a comedy writer, you become so calloused to so much out there, 'cause we're so immersed in pop culture and comedy that it takes a lot to entertain us. We become hard laughs. But with Steve, he's already, you know, way left of center.

STEVE: After decades of writing comedy and working in comedy, I do think that many of the receptors in my brain that would allow me to enjoy comedy like civilians, I would call them, have been burned out. People around me will be roaring with laughter at something, and I'll just be nodding politely. For me now to find anything that makes me burst out laughing is somewhat rare. That's just Bob's head on a stock-photo guy's body. ELLENBERG: It makes perfect sense that Steve would be enamored with something -called The Bathrooms Are Coming! -Yeah. -Isn't that the name of it? Okay. -Yeah. HANNAH: I had been hearing The Bathrooms Are Coming! as long as I can remember, but I didn't actually know what it was. I thought he had just kind of made it up. -I thought he made it up, too. -And, like, it was this thing in our family. Now, here's something that nobody cares about. Sorry. Back up. Here's something that most people don't know about. Um, and-and he's just turning it into this huge thing. I found out that it was part of a bigger thing later. Yeah, that was a shock. STEVE: So, how does a cynical comedy writer with comedy damage get emotionally involved with people who wrote musicals about ball bearings and light bulbs and bathtubs? It began really very accidentally and randomly. - LETTERMAN: Here we go! SINGERS: ♪ Dave's Record Collection. ♪ Perfect. Oh, good. Uh, here we have an album, it's called Number One Hard. Now, this is a musical. Please don't make up your own jokes.

It's a comedy bit we do on the show. We find unintentionally funny and weird records, and make jokes about 'em. CHILDISH VOICE: I'm a bad bird. STEVE: Bloopers, I probably would not have gotten, 'cause that's already trying to be funny. The best stuff for "Record Collection" was the stuff that was unintentionally hilarious. But then I started finding these mysterious corporate souvenir records marked on the labels "not for commercial use," "not for broadcast," "souvenir use only." And I had no idea what I was finding.

Some big faceless corporation trying to put on a-a musical like a Broadway show. How pathetic. A whole musical about diesel engines or Oldsmobiles or sneakers. Thank you, comedy gods, because this is hilarious. These weren't jingles. These weren't commercials. This was a full-fledged Broadway-style musical show for a private audience of people within the company. ANNOUNCER: You did it, and we are here today -to pay tribute to you. STEVE: Some were live recordings, and you hear audience going, "Whoo-hoo!" And sometimes you'll see a letter tucked inside. "Here's the souvenir of the-the fun we had last May." You just think, "Well, that's kind of sad, isn't it?" What kind of people worked on this stuff? I mean, that must be the strangest dead end of show business that anyone's ever wandered into.

JONATHAN WARD: At that time, 20 years ago, there was less Internet involvement. It was canvassing record stores and cold-faxing record stores around the country.

And then another mutual friend and connoisseur of the incredibly strange said, "Yeah, yeah, I know that Arrow shirt record. "I mean, there's somebody who really knows about that stuff.

The reason I-I think I suggested, -um, Walter Marks... -Mm-hmm. ...is because it's a Kerbowie NPO production. Uh-huh. But, uh, Michael Brown did -the '64 Dodge show. -Did he? -Which is Kerbowie as well. Oh, yes. -Yes, it is. Steve Young was my mentor. He started the canon, and I added to it.

WARD: Where Steve took it into a different level was that he was contacting people who were actually in the shows. STEVE: Maybe they'll talk to me, and maybe they'll say, "Oh, sure, "I have a closet full of records I'd be glad to... to-to fix you up with." MELODY: It just blew me away when I heard from you. -Mm-hmm. -And then, when you sent that - Purina Dog Chow film... I mean, I just about fell over. I didn't even remember that they had filmed that. You don't have any, uh, records or tapes or videotapes or anything from your industrial stuff? You know, I don't think I do. -Mm. -I mean, it's been a long time ago. Well, I've got some names I can toss out. -See if they shake anything loose. -Okay. Uh, Sheldon Harnick? Yes, of course. I did an industrial with him. -Really? -I forget what it was. I had grown up not really caring about Broadway musicals. So these records had names and credits on them, but I didn't recognize names. A friend of mine had to say, "Do you realize who these people are? "Sheldon Harnick and Jerry Bock wrote Fiddler on the Roof. "John Kander and Fred Ebb, they're famous. "They... they did Cabaret. They did Chicago." So many performers and writers, choreographers have this stuff in their background. Bob Fosse, Bob Newhart, Chita Rivera, Florence Henderson, Martin Short, Susan Stroman. These are people who have changed American culture. That's, I think, when it started to feel like I've found some sort of treasure trove here that we weren't supposed to know about at all. Everybody else has been told, "This is not for you, and you can safely ignore it." But something in me-- maybe it's comedy damage-- said, "That's where I want to go now." --Hi. Hi. -Hello. -Oh. -Well, hi, Steve. -Hello, Florence. -Hello, Sheldon. -Welcome to casa mia. Ah, thank you. I brought some memorabilia. -This is from the early 1970s... -Oh, my God. -Hello, Hank. -Good to see you. It was almost like having a door open to a secret society a little bit. The general public had no knowledge of what was going on unless you were at one of these sales meetings. They were never publicized. There was no advertising. There were no tickets sold or anything like that. It was like we were CIA agents. MARTIN SHORT: You'd travel all over. Great hotels, great salary. It was a dream job. It was great if you could get one, and there were a lot of them. I did them for Shell gasoline. The Buick show. The Ford tractor show. CHUCK KAREL: York air conditioners, American Standard air conditioners, General Electric. BEEBE: I did Dodge, Cadillac, RCA, McDonald's. -Burger King. -KAREL: Ragu. -And Nabisco. At one point, I did a big industrial show for Maidenform. PETER SHAWN: The 75th anniversary of the Ford Motor Company comes to mind as one of the most extravagant. HENDERSON: I'm partial, but I think the ones we did, the Oldsmobile industrial shows, were by far the best. I got your number through Melody. Now, did you know some of the other Chicago people? SILVESTRE and KELLY: Oh, yes. STEVE: The more I looked, the more it just opened up and got broader and deeper. How about Sandi Freeman of the legendary show, -The Bathrooms Are Coming!? -KELLY: Yes. SILVESTRE: Oh, she was on the Pure Oil tour with me. -She moved away. -STEVE: I started to suspect that there were thousands of other shows. So, what else is out there, and just how far does this go? KELLY: You uncovered a whole new world that was going on in those days. Yes, and it's still unfolding. ANNOUNCER: Everywhere throughout the civilized world, people know this street. Broadway, USA, the longest street in the world. But Broadway is a street of many moods, and we're going to see most of them. BEEBE: When I arrived in New York, I wanted to be Richard Rodgers. But when I got there, I found there already was one. And he was very active. RIVERA: Yeah, I came along at what they call the Golden Age. And that was when there was... every single theater had a... a hit in it. HARNICK: Theater was something I knew absolutely nothing about, but a friend loaned me a copy of Finian's Rainbow. I listened to it, and I thought those lyrics were so clever. That is what I want to do with my life. STEVE: So, your first awareness that there was something called an industrial show was after you had gotten to New York and you were trying to break into -the songwriting business. -Yeah. By-by that time, I had placed songs in revues. I don't think that I'd had a book musical yet, but I was broke and that's where the industrials came in. ♪ Money, money, money, money, money ♪ ♪ Paychecks come to quite a sum ♪ ♪ Money, money ♪ ♪ If you're gonna get this plum ♪ -♪ Money, money ♪ -♪ You gotta shake it loose ♪ ♪ You gotta shake it loose ♪ ♪ You gotta shake, shake, shake it loose ♪ BEEBE: During that period of '50s, '60s and '70s, there was this enormous optimism in the United States. And the industrial shows represented that optimism. America came out of World War II, and we just kept right on going. Tomorrow's gonna be better than yesterday, and everybody felt that. ANNOUNCER: It looks like an ordinary day in the USA, but in the city of Flint, Michigan, all is excitement. For on this day, General Motors is building its 50 millionth car. No one has ever come close to that before, so no wonder celebration is in the very air. MAN: Now, I know that your district managers already told you something about our August-September-October sales drive, but the details of this program are so startling that we thought our entire selling organization would like to be together to hear about them. ♪ Honolulu's waiting for you, Firestone ♪ ♪ Honolulu's celebrating Firestone ♪ ♪ Win a prize, come to paradise ♪ ♪ Have a happy, happy, happy time ♪ ♪ There'll be music like you never heard before... ♪ ESTEY: During a certain time frame, it was very popular for businesspeople to hold an annual meeting where they would bring in their salespeople. -♪ You can be the one ♪ -♪ All yours ♪ ♪ You can have the fun... ♪ MAN: Over 1,000 salespeople will spend the next four days learning more know-how from top sales executives -in the industry. -MAN: So I say to you, go out and sell Tupperware. But also sell America. SHAWN: The executives wanted to introduce new products to all their salesmen. So they-they combined education with entertainment. MAN: There are going to be cars, singing, dancing, movies and more cars. LETTERMAN: To me, all I can think of is a hotel banquet room, and they're clearing the plates and the half-eaten roast beef, and the cigarette butts are being taken away, and... and there may be, uh, Baked Alaska for dessert, and then the house lights dim, and then...

You can compare that, for instance, to what it cost to put My Fair Lady on that same month in 1956, which was $446,000. STEVE: So the amount of money being spent on the real Broadway musicals is being dwarfed by the amount of money spent over decades on the industrial shows. At the time, yes, absolutely. -Yeah. -So, real Broadway is this little tip sticking above the water. Industrials are the eight-ninths of the iceberg under water.

And the composer, Sid Siegel, I couldn't find. Sport noticed on YouTube once somebody had put up the song "My Bathroom." But one of the comments was, "Oh, my aunt sang that." That's what broke it open. So I'm talking suddenly to Patt, one of the cast members from The Bathrooms Are Coming! She e-mailed me at one point and said, "I didn't want to tell you until I was sure, "but I-I went and looked through a lot of stuff, "and I do have a 16-millimeter film of The Bathrooms Are Coming! show." This was a bolt out of the blue. I could not have even dared to hope that there was a film. I put the DVD into the player with trembling hands.

I met my husband on that show. Yes. The caveman. - PATT: Yes. Yes. -Yes, I chased him until he caught me. - STEVE: You marry him, what, like a year and a half -after The Bathrooms Are Coming!? -Yes. -SANDI: Dave Shelley. -PATT: Dave Shelley was my husband's best man. -STEVE: At your wedding, at which you danced to... -Yes. ♪ My bathroom, my bathroom. ♪ Just, like, I could not have imagined a more, uh, thrilling detail in my little world. ♪ They said it couldn't be done ♪ ♪ Said it couldn't be done ♪ ♪ With Ultra Bath we went ahead and did it ♪ ♪ They said it couldn't be done ♪ ♪ Said it couldn't be done ♪ ♪ With Spectra 70 we went and did it... ♪ STEVE: Now we are heading up to Buffalo Grove to track down the elusive Sid Siegel.

Were you surprised when this 45-year-old production that you had just done and moved past seemed to be catching on as this underground favorite? Yes, I discovered -it was on the Internet -Uh-huh. -and was very surprised. -Mm-hmm. - Everyone laughed about the bathroom. - They thought it was gonna be, "Isn't that funny?" But it was nothing like that. It was all about new-new fixtures for the bathroom. WOMAN: I want it all changed. It doesn't do what a bathroom should do. It, uh... it's unsafe, it's inconvenient - and it's ugly. STEVE: When you hear it years later and you're just somebody from the outside world, not in the business, -it just seems crazy. -Right. Is there any show that you worked on over the years that you recall as a particularly good one? Oh, yes. IGA, International Harvester.

Ah, there you go. Once you started doing industrial shows, and these producers and production companies found out that you could handle all of this material, -then you worked a lot. A lot. -STEVE: Mm-hmm. Must've been surreal to just do this stuff that you maybe have half of an understanding of what you're even talking about. Sometimes no understanding. Uh, perfect example, the John Deere tractor company. I had a long speech that I had to give about liquid manure. -And so I learned a little bit about a lot of things. -Mm-hmm. Dangerous, dangerous. I remember one song was... ♪ I'd rather be a Fury than a Ford. ♪ And through dry ice and dancing girls, the-the new Fury would come out and...

But what was exciting about it was because you got paid more money than you'd ever gotten paid as a performer, and, you know, you'd learn to sing and dance. You had to do it. -You had to do it well. -STROMAN: If you could book maybe four industrials a year, you could survive in New York. But for me, uh, as a creator, they actually helped me develop how I arrange music for dance, how I put a show together. I did learn from them. ♪ Case by case, we grab the space ♪ ♪ In kegs and bottles and cans ♪ ♪ Every detail counts and the numbers mount ♪ ♪ When we're working hand in hand... ♪ STROMAN: I choreographed an industrial show for Miller beer one time, and they ended up putting a group of-of lovely dancers in beer-- giant beer cans. We were in rehearsal, and-and the two beer cans slammed into each other, and then the girls couldn't get up. And of course that made me hysterical. I thought it was, like, the funniest thing I'd ever seen. - DANCERS: Hooray! STROMAN: We ended up keeping it in. WOMAN: Could somebody help me up? STROMAN: So, doing industrials gave me confidence. ESTEY: I mean, it's not necessarily the material that you studied, as an actor prepares with Stanislavski. But it was about the product. And you have to... and one needs to be as sincere and supportive about that particular dialogue as if it were Chekhov or Shakespeare. It's just that it's not the product it's supposed to be, Frank. And, Frank, three pickles instead of four? -Come on. -Oh, boy. - Now you're counting pickles! I'm losing money and you're counting pickles! You guys are some help. BEEBE: There was therapy involved, too. They wanted to teach their managers management techniques that would make things better for the people involved in their operations. So we would write a show about a manager, disaffected, of course, finding ways that he could find his way back into the fold. ♪ You tell me that your profits are down ♪ ♪ And things are not what they used to be ♪ ♪ You're ready to close it down ♪ ♪ Well, just take a moment and listen to me ♪ ♪ Wishing won't make a winner ♪ ♪ Nothing good in life comes free ♪ ♪ It takes energy, effort and determination ♪ ♪ To get you where you wanna be... ♪ STEVE: So, the audience is full of salesmen -and distributors. -BEEBE: That's right.

It's got them all hyped up and ready to go back and-and give it the ol' Culligan thing again. Salesmen were really... they were thrilled about this whole thing. And they just went out gangbusters, like a pep rally. HENDERSON: When you heard these dealers, my gosh, you'd think it was some kind of... I don't know. STEVE: Like a religious revival? Yeah, or a sexual experience. I don't know how you would exactly, uh... But they were like, "Whoa! The new cars!" That was exciting to see how excited they were.

Oh, ooh, review the document. Well, I'm not really sure what this all means, but I will review the document at my leisure. I've had a steady job and a steady paycheck for so long that I've never really had to think about month to month, what am I gonna do next?

SUSAN: Well, it's okay. I just want to tell you that Alan would not fit the, uh, Communist hat. He has such a large head, so we'll have to deal with sizes. Yeah. D-Do you have a smaller head for him? - SUSAN: Pardon? STEVE: Good Lord, Susan, these are the final days of Rome. We have to do what we can do to make this happen. SUSAN: Ah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. STEVE: Yeah, I can save all the scripts and whatever I write, but there's something about a show and music that if it's... if it's not alive and being heard, then it's really... it's really gone. And so I feel a kinship with so many of these people who worked on projects and shows that they knew the best case scenario was it was gonna be a tremendous success and people would leave saying, "Wow, that was terrific," but that was the end forever. Oh, look at that. More programs. An International Harvester show. You realize how rare these things are? -You probably have the only ones in the world. -Yeah. Star World '79, another one I've never heard of. Yeah, that was a big one. -STEVE: Las Vegas announcement. -Went to two... two cities, I believe. STEVE: Did you ever ask for a discount on a car or truck? No, they didn't offer me. Oh, you gotta ask, Sid. Oh, look at this. This is beautiful. "We're number one." Amoco, Chicago North District. So these weren't even necessarily national conventions. -This was a regional show. -No. Regional. STEVE: Mm. -What does it say? -Oh, my goodness. -Burny Brothers. -It says Burny Brothers Bakery. That's the '70s. STEVE: That looks like a sexy show, Sid. SID: Yeah, yeah, it was. - It's all about b-bakery goods. Did you get some free rolls? --Sid, you're killing me. You gotta ask for free stuff. Okay, from now on. All right. I'm gonna be your manager, and I'm gonna make, uh, some outrageous demands from now on. You did these shows very quickly. You moved on and you did the next one and the next one. And it all became a blur. And it's been nice for me that, 40 or 50 years later, I get to tell somebody, "You know, I really enjoyed this thing you wrote in 1966." They never had the time or the luxury to really assess what they were doing. So we have found the lost Library of Alexandria here. BEEBE: That's right. STEVE: Is it okay if I go up and take a look? BEEBE: Be my guest. I'm glad for it. -STEVE: Dig through stuff. -Yep. I dreamed of being an archeologist when I was a kid, like Howard Carter, uh, uncovering the tomb of King Tut, and this is probably as close as I'm ever gonna get to that. Well, you dug me up. I did, and you're-you're still walking the Earth, thank God. Oh, my God, the actual material here from the-the Seagram's Symphony. A whole batch of RCA stuff I've never heard of. And this is just like one one-thousandth - of what's up here. Oh, it's... it's thrilling and fatiguing to look at this. For every one I know, there's probably dozens and dozens of things that were never recorded. That's right. Do you, do you feel regretful about that? -Do you think, "Oh, I wish..." -I-I did for a minute. When Nancy and I would sit at the show and listen to the overture and realize that's the last time we're gonna hear that overture, and then hear the opening number, last time we're gonna hear that. It was a bittersweet time. STEVE: Are you proud of what you did in this world? Absolutely. Absolutely. Working with the captains of industry to improve the lives of the people in the audience, and then fanning out from there, uh, the general public. I was part of it. Did your family understand what you were doing with these shows? BEEBE: No, they didn't. It was a tragedy for me at the time. My mother wanted me to not only play but to live in Carnegie Hall. That was her-her dream for me. And of course, the way things worked out, what I was doing was not something that she was proud of. Uh, she said, not to me but to someone else-- I guess it was Nancy-- "Why, it's nothing but a bunch of commercials." And, uh, when I heard that, it-it really hurt me, you know, that-that she didn't see what I saw. SANDI: It bothered me, at the time, that when people would say, "Well, and what do you do?" and I'd say, "Well, I mainly do industrial theater," and they... and they didn't know what it was. -Mm-hmm. -That only the-the employees inside these companies knew -and the general public didn't know. -Mm-hmm. STEVE: How can there be something so large and so crazy in the world that we had no idea of? This is too good to just let disappear.

Welcome back. -Nice to have you on the program. -Dave. Hi. -Thank you. -Before we get started, I'd like to point out that you're the coauthor of this, uh, fascinating book. Tell people what we're looking at there, Everything's Coming Up Profits. STEVE: Yes, it's a book about one of the least known and least understood musical genres that ever existed. TERRY GROSS: This is Fresh Air. I'm Terry Gross. With us is Steve Young who has a whole new book about industrial musicals. Steve, do you have another favorite? STEVE: Do you have a... a York air conditioner song? GROSS: Oh, I like that one! Yes, excuse me. Some of these are just so much fun. MURPHY: You know, the response is great. I-I think people get it the same way we get it, which is nice. STEVE: Every time I look at the book, I think, "Yes!" And if we hadn't done it, I-I don't know that anyone ever really would've. It's been a long time coming, but I'm very proud how it turned out. -Oh, this... -Oh, it's wonderful. -Hard copy. -Yes. I'll show you the pages that have some of your... your work on it. LAURA LINDGREN: After the book came out, I got an e-mail from a young woman in the Midwest, and she said, "Oh, my God. My dad made that illustration." She was very excited and brought it home and said, "Dad, you're finally published." STEVE: These people have given me a great deal of their time, letting me talk to them and seeing stuff in their collections. I just wanted to make sure that they were able to hold the... the book in their hands. LINDGREN: Michael Brown, he... after the book was done, he passed away. But, you know, we all felt just so good that it made him so happy. You have come out and said, "Look, this is what was happening back then, "and it was important, and it gave pleasure to people." I think, just pleasure. So you would tell people that yes, they should buy the book at full retail price? Oh, yes, absolutely. No question about that. STEVE: On a purely logical basis, I shouldn't be here. I should never have met Sid, who wrote music I wasn't supposed to hear. But I did hear Sid's music, I did meet him, and here I am this evening. Life can be so rich and wonderful when we step off the logical path and embark on eccentric adventures. Getting to know people like Sid and Patt and their families and becoming a little part of their lives, it has meant so much to me to be able to say to Sid, and others like him, "Your work is great. "Your work has not been forgotten. Your work endures." Thank you, Sid, for a wonderful, eccentric adventure. And just that I merited inclusion here is-is very touching. At first, I was looking at it very practically, from a record collecting standpoint. I focused on people that I thought could find me more records. I certainly never thought I would end up making friends with people all over the country and getting to know their families and being part of these emotional reunions and these moments that really... It was far more than... than you would think you would get into when you start looking for a ridiculous record album to make a joke about. STEVE: So, what do you think? What-what will we be doing next? You've got a million things on the plate. Yes, and I should make a clear five to seven dollars from them, if I'm lucky, over the next year. Good-bye, Joe. I love you.

This evening, I'm going to lead you through a door, - a door that's usually locked. It's marked "authorized personnel only." On the other side of that door, you're going to see and hear things -you were never meant to see or hear. - RIVERA: Should there be another lifetime, I would always want to come back and be in the theater, because the theater is life. You talk to people. You tell them stories. You watch them enjoy it or be moved by it. You're part of people's lives. Even when applied to the project of selling a piece of agricultural equipment? Absolutely. BEEBE: Musical theater is our art form, American art form. Opera is Europe's, but this is ours. It's peculiarly American. STEVE: And if the musical is the American art form, then the industrial musical is the hyper-American art form. Absolutely, absolutely. I think it has an unexpected importance that you and certainly I would never have noticed when I was holding up the records on the show. It, uh, illuminates an American business world that doesn't exist at all anymore, and that says a lot about the change between now and then. You know, people were lifers. They would work for Kinney Shoes their entire career. I don't even think you could anymore. BIAFRA: The people who made these cars cared about them, so they could say, "Yeah, I'm part of this, I made this." You don't get that now. HARNICK: It was an extremely important part of the entertainment industry. It was important to me, both financially and as an education. HENDERSON: I'm very proud of those shows. I think some companies might think about doing it again, Steve, and you should be the producer. -STEVE: Okay. -Maybe you should star in it. STEVE: Since the book came out, I've found, to my surprise somewhat, that there is more of this industrial sort of work still going on, very much in, uh, the old tradition. I have to believe that I can do it. - And you know what? I truly believe I can! STEVE: So, a few companies have kept the flame alive. I've seen, uh, Walmart: The Musical, less than ten years old. Really very much like an old line industrial with a plot and characters set in a Walmart store. I don't know if this night has been real or some incredible dream or if we've been inhaling too many fumes - from the paint department. STEVE: Maybe the wheel has turned and what-what is old is new again. BOLLES: I hope everyone becomes interested in it. -Yeah. -'Cause then I can sell the ones I don't care about for lots of money. - STEVE: Capitalist pig. Well, I learned that by listening to these records. - I really got motivated to, to sell, sell, sell. STEVE: You know her, the brunette from The Bathrooms Are Coming!

I mean, to me, that's how it sounded. I just haven't received that kind of appreciation for my talent. Uh, you know, my husband was the star. It was just, it was really, really nice. You know. STEVE: Getting to know a lot of these veterans from the field has... opened up my ability to... be receptive to people. Whereas before, they might have just passed through my field of vision without a thought, or I might have made some snap judgment in a snarky way. Now I think, "That-that old guy? "He might be the Sid Siegel of something. "That woman there, that might be the Patt Stanton Gjonola "of some realm of creative work that I will never know, but she might be fantastic." HANNAH: You know, everyone says, like, be yourself and do what you want to do, but he definitely showed me that I can do whatever I want to do, even if it's something weird - that literally no one else has ever heard about. - STEVE: It's gone further than I've imagined. Now I'm working on songs with Hank Beebe. I saw his name in 1995 on a record album, and just thought, "Who's that guy?" But it is a thrill to be... on a piece of music paper where it's his name and my name. That's... that's, uh, worth a stack of records to the moon. ♪ If your life is gray and normal ♪ ♪ And you're wishing there was more ♪ ♪ Clues about a different world ♪ ♪ May whisper, come explore ♪ ♪ That little voice inside you ♪ ♪ Knows how rich your life could be ♪ ♪ Even though most people cannot see ♪ ♪ The things you see... ♪ ♪ Take that step, shine your light ♪ ♪ That left turn might be right ♪ ♪ Don't wait for the world to say okay ♪ ♪ Find your own way ♪ ♪ Find that path others missed ♪ ♪ Life is grander with a twist ♪ ♪ There's that knock you've heard before ♪ ♪ Open that door ♪ ♪ You may find that selling ♪ ♪ Is what you're born to do ♪ ♪ Or singing or collecting ♪ ♪ Is what makes you feel like you ♪ ♪ Take that step, shine your light ♪ ♪ That left turn might be right ♪ ♪ Don't wait for the world to say okay ♪ ♪ Find your own way ♪ ♪ You may find you're doing jazz hands ♪ ♪ When someone says Dow Jones ♪ ♪ Or maybe you start dancing ♪ ♪ When you hear silicones ♪ -♪ Silicones ♪ -♪ Silicones ♪ ♪ Silicones ♪ ♪ Take that step ♪ ♪ Open that door ♪ ♪ Hear a song and you may realize ♪ ♪ Now you have the power ♪ ♪ There's a sparkle in your eyes ♪ ♪ You want to sell a shower ♪ ♪ The more we keep on moving ♪ ♪ Stepping toward our dream ♪ ♪ The more we find our people ♪ ♪ We are stronger as a team ♪ ♪ Take that step, shine your light ♪ ♪ That left turn might be right ♪ ♪ Don't wait for the world to say okay ♪ ♪ Find your own way ♪ ♪ Find that path others missed ♪ ♪ Life is grander with a twist ♪ ♪ There's that knock ♪ ♪ Open that door ♪ ♪ Take that step ♪ ♪ It'll change your life ♪ ♪ Take that step ♪ ♪ It'll change your life ♪ ♪ Take that step, take that step ♪ ♪ It'll change your life ♪ ♪ Take that step ♪ ♪ It'll change your life... ♪ ♪ It'll change your life. ♪
