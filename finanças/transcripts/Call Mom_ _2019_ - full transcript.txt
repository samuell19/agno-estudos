"Secure, stable guy, big heart... ...but not afraid of adventure. Is it working? You're on Tinder? Dad! -Can I have wine, too? -No. -Why not? -Because you're 14. Wait, what do you mean by "adventure"? You know, like a weekend trip or something.. Oh, come on. Okay, mountain climbing then. That's not what that means. -What what means? -It means have sex. What?! Come on. You had to know. You should put "not afraid of sex" instead. -Please stop. -Why are you so stressed? Let's talk about something else. Other fun things from our childhood. No, I want to talk about why... ...my big brother calls sex with him an adventure. Mom, it was so nice to come over for Saturday lunch. How was the wine? Very good. -You haven't eaten anything. -What? Aren't you going to eat? No, I will. Why aren't you eating? -Mom. -Niki. Mom! Are you full, Tomas?

We'll see if I make it. Maggie's on her way now. -I can drive you. I'm off now. -That's not necessary. Sure it is. Just give me five minutes. Okay. -So when would you be back? -One hour. Will you take Christmas Eve for me? Absolutely. I, Maggie, ask you, Anna- -to be my beloved- -my friend, and my wife.

Please come get it by Wednesday. Or I'll throw it out. Hello? Hi! Hi. -It's your dad. -I'm not here. -Hi, Tomas. -Hi, is Liv there? -No. -Turn on Facetime. Show me! What, you think I hid her in this wardrobe or something? Call if you hear from her. -Thanks. -No problem. -Bye. -Bye. Thank you! Is something wrong? Dad is insane. I'm not allowed to go out. -Was that your dad? -No, someone I'm chatting with. You're answering right away? -Yeah. -Come on, you have to wait! You're sending vibes that you're nuts. No one answers right away. -How long do you have to wait? -Twelve hours. -Why? -So he loses confidence. Right now he's up here. He should be- Straight down. -Hello? -Hi! -Who's this? -Niki. Is that you, Alex? Shit, I'm sorry, I... I called the wrong number. -Okay. -But it was nice talking to you. Uh...bye, then. -Bye. -Bye. I'll text Tomas so he doesn't call the police. Okay. Who was that Alex that called before? A guy I was with a long time ago. When? Um...I was 23. Did you have lots of sex? Yes. Where? Mostly at the carwash downtown. Why did you break up? Because he was going to study nursing in Copenhagen. Do you still like him? You sounded super weird on the phone. -What do you mean? -"Is that you, Alex?" I didn't talk like that. I said, "Is that you, Alex?" "Is that you, Alex?" No, "Is that you, Alex?" I sounded totally normal. Plus, he had the wrong number. -The wrong number? -Sure, that happens. Did he, though? If he's that weird, just forget him. It would just be annoying. Big no. I don't like him. Good night. You look very nice in pink. Lots of people don't. Oh, this is so old. I'll put your coffee here. Thanks. Did you bring any company? No, my daughter was going to come but she got sick. -Would you like a sandwich? -Yes, please. -Cheese or ham? -Cheese, please. All right. A nurse will be by soon to set up your IV. Hi. Where's the box? It's upstairs. No, no, I'm throwing all of this out. What happened to your arm? This is really pretty. -I'll take this. -No, that's mine. -But you were going to toss it. -No, I'm keeping it. I bought this dress in Milan in 1969. -Why are you doing this now? -Just decluttering. This isn't decluttering. This is death cleaning. What? What are you looking at? Mom, are you okay? Yes! Mom! Open the door, okay? Mom!!! Hello, Sofia. Hi. Welcome to the Radio Psychologist. I don't know much, so tell me what led you to call in. She always gets angry. -And it's always my fault. -I see. Are you busy with something else right now? What are you doing? I'm...I'm just cleaning up a little. -Can't it wait? -Yes. Good. Just stop for a moment. Think about what you're so afraid of. I don't know. It sounds to me like you have mixed feelings about your daughter. -Do you love her? -Yes... Have you told her that? No... ...but I will. You want to. What are you afraid might happen... ...if you do it? If you tell her? That she won't feel the same way. I can tell you're tense. This is hard for you to talk about, but I wonder if that's why? -Okay, see you in four weeks. -Great, I'll make an appointment. Bye, sweetie! Oh, those feet! Thanks! See you. -Hi! -Hi! Go right in. Listen, 20 minutes. I mean, did you see those tiny, cute feet? Yeah, I saw you looking at them. I have to have a baby. Alex called. What did he say? That he called the wrong number. Okay. Were you upset? No, why would I be? Just think how awful it would be if he'd said he's in love with you. and has been thinking of you for five years. Why would that be awful? Well, because you hate it when people get too close. I don't know what you're talking about. Well, take Rodrigo. You know where you stand. You fuck, he goes home to his wife and kids... ...you go home, take a bath, listen to music or whatever. It's safe. But if Alex called and said... "Niki, you're my everything, I want to marry you" That would be tough on you. Lie on your back. But this Alex thing, It's no big deal. If I wanted to see him, I would. -But you'd never call him. -Sure I would. Nope. No way. -Give me my phone. -What? Can I have my phone? Hi, Alex. Just wanted to say it was so nice to see you. And... ...maybe we could meet up? Have a beer or something. Uh...give me a call. Can I see your recent calls? Why? Hey, you only did half my pussy. I have another customer. Hi. A ginger ale and lasagna, please. Hi! Hi. Are you waiting for someone? No. How's your nose? -Is it...crooked? -No! No, it looks good. Really good. Thanks. Thank you. How's life? Great! Are you seeing anyone? Yes. God, that's...great. Who is he? Someone I work with. How about you? No, I'm...on my own. And it's...nice. It's really fucking nice. But I'm so happy you found someone. What's his name? -Rodrigo. -Rodrigo. Cool name. -Fuck! -Whoops! Here. Do you want... Want my...? -No. -No, take it. Um...yeah, it's fine. Thanks. -Everything taste okay? -Yes, very good. Women's clinic, Midwife Leila here. I'd like to schedule an abortion. Okay, when was your last period? Five or six weeks ago. Maybe. We can book you for three weeks from now. You'll see a midwife... ...and speak with a counselor about your decision if you like. Hello? Hello! Okay, but that won't work. I need an appointment now. We don't have any earlier slots. Women's clinic, Midwife Leila here. Yes, hello. I would like an abortion. Okay, when was your last period? I'm an elite gymnast, competing in the Euro Championship in 2 weeks. I see. But wasn't the Euro Championship in August? -No. -Yes...that was back in August. Well, for me, PE is one of the most important classes. It's where we learn motor skills, and research has shown... ...that physical activity releases endorphins that help students... ...do even better in other subjects. Listen up, we're just on a tour. Just observing. Parents of future students. Just so you all know. Uh... Given that our society is so sedentary these days... PE fills an important... For our part, the leadership is happy to continue... If it's feasible... No, no. Exactly. Perfect. Exactly. And just an aside... Loop in Gunilla on this so she's on the same page... Exactly. Great. Listen, I've got a thing here... Later. Bye. You're so pretty. -Where should we go? -What do you feel like? -Thai, or what? -I just want rice. Rice. Okay, so Thai? Or there's Indian. Want to do that? Or the Asian place, but I heard it's not great. What else? Or should we just go for sushi? Shit, but the salmon didn't seem fresh last time. It was all... Excuse me, pushing it more won't make it go any faster. Couldn't someone open one of those awesome bowl places? Or...Fontana? Fucking psycho. -So want to do Fontana? -Yeah. -Is that okay? -Yep. No rice, though. Hello? Hi Niki, it's Mom. Yeah, I saw. Why didn't you answer? Because... I took a sleeping pill. I'm going to bed. That's so dangerous! You could fall asleep and never wake up. Where'd you read that? Did you read the article on Stellan Skarsgård in the paper? No. It was so interesting to read about how he works. -Know what he said? -No. He said you have to be very open and vulnerable... ...if you're going to be ambitious and succeed. Otherwise you'll just panic and it will all go to hell. That made me think of you. Maybe you should aim a little higher. Mom, I'm hanging up now. Do you want to have lunch on Saturday? Why? Do you want to or not? Okay. At noon! -Okay. Bye. -Bye. Good, Sabrin. Well done, Nifelli. Good, Love! Rodrigo: Please, please answer Uh...good. Rodrigo: Come on! Answer! Hello! Call me! No, no, no! I'm sorry! Are you okay? Thanks. -Does it hurt? -Yeah. -But your tooth isn't loose? -No. It hurts a lot. Great. You two go nuts. Daddy will be back in 2 seconds. -Dad! -Hold on! Niki, can I borrow you for 20 seconds? Oh! Are you okay? This won't take long. Carro searched my phone. She read all our texts. -Dad! -Dad is working, just wait. You promised to take us to the toy store. We will, but play here for a minute. I'm working. I have to talk to these kids' teacher. Daddy's coming. -Shouldn't they be in school? -Sick day. The thing is, she might call you. I wanted you to hear it from me first. Tell her what you want, but I thought it would be good idea to... ...get our stories straight. If that's okay. Because I told her it was a one-time thing. And that there was no sex, just...petting. -Got it? -Yeah. And it was after that kickoff party. -Hold on. Kick...off...petting. Exactly. And then we kept texting... ...which was dumb, but it's totally over. -It...is...totally...over. -Exactly. Thanks. Hold on, sorry. We just have to lay low for a while, you know? Are you okay? You're not, like... I mean, tell me you're not... I am. How many weeks? -Don't worry, I'm getting rid of it. -What? When? I made an appointment. Or, I will. I can't deal with this now. I'll have to get back to you. It's going to be fine. I promise. I love you. -You have a wonderful family. -But... If it all goes to shit, would you want to be with me? Dad! Dad is working, Cesar! Dad! Shut up! Dad!!! Harry's hanging from the ceiling! Harry! Shit! Take it easy. What the hell, Cesar? Harry, come down. I'm here. Just climb down. I'm right here. Don't say anything negative, don't comment on her appearance. Don't ask if she's met someone. Don't say anything negative, don't comment on her appearance. Don't ask if she's met someone. Don't say anything negative, don't comment on... -Hi. -Hi. Your hair looks nice. -What? -I made lasagna. There's just something I need help with first. Start with the mustache. Did you know that you... ...wanted to have kids with Dad when you were pregnant with Tomas? Have you met someone? But we're not together. Yes, I know how it always goes. Here. Are you sure it's gone? Couldn't you date Carl? He's gay, Mom. -How about his brother? -He's gay too. Both of them? Stop that! I think you should go now. Just gonna finish eating first. I have cancer. Pancreatic. Does Tomas know? Yes. And Liv? Have you told everyone but me? You're so sensitive. You always overreact. I'm sensitive? I feel like I can't talk to you. How am I supposed to react? Tell me! How should I know how you should react? Was it meant to be a surprise, that you'd suddenly be dead? No. I'm sorry, but how hot was I, scale of 1-10... -...at my wedding? -What? Like, how hot was I at my wedding? Mega-hot. I was so fucking happy with my makeup. Check this out. Me and Anna. I remember. It wasn't that long ago. Can I just ask, what happened to your boobs? -What do you mean? -They're huge. I'm on my period. -Look look look. -Let's sit over there, Mom. You know, my mom and me... ...she's not just my mom. We're like best friends. -Oh, are you? -Yeah. Just like me and my mom. We can talk about anything. Anything at all. Me and my mom went on a trip a few weeks ago. -Where? -Italy. -How long? -A week. God, that's great. Me and my mom... ...we call each other every morning and night. Well, me and my mom... we even wear the same size. And you have the same taste. Why not move in together and share a closet? -We already live together. -Do you? -I'd like to move inside my mom again. -Sure. Into her uterus. And just lie there. -And chill. -And chill. Seriously, I'm about to puke. How is your mom? Don't know. Haven't talked to her since Christmas. -Wanna swim? -Yeah. Come on in! No! You fucker! -Do you have a tampon? -No... I'm out. But I've got a paper napkin. Thanks. Do you know anyone who would give away some sperm? -Aren't you on the waiting list? -Yeah, but I'm sick of waiting. ...and we don't want just anyone. Anna and me, we were talking the other day... ...and... ...we thought... ...maybe you could ask Rodrigo? If he wanted to give away some sperm? Of course. No, obviously I'm kidding. Seriously? What do you think? I can't ask him. Maggie. No problem. Maggie! -Hello? -Hi! Hi. -Were you in bed? -No. I had to move my car and ended up by your place. So I thought maybe I could pick up my shirt? Uh, okay. Should I come up? No, I'll come down. Fuck. Fuck. -Hello? -Are you coming? I'm on my way. -That took awhile. -Did it? -Here you go. -Thanks. Well...guess I'll be going. Someone's coming over, so... Rodrigo? Okay. Bye. Are your speakers still terrible? Yeah. Okay? I can't believe you still have this car. No reason to upgrade if it still works. It just needs a wash. First. Now second. Not third, second. -Third, now, third! -Aren't you riled up! I tried to forget you. Because I figured... ...that there were... ...hundreds of people like you. But... ...there aren't. Niki. Tomas! -Oh hi, Niki. -Hi. Hi, Picasso! I tried to call, but you didn't answer. No, sorry. Can you help me with this? Pretty nice, isn't it? How's Mom? You could call her and ask. I'm asking you. She's going to die. See you later. Good Picasso. Let's keep going. Mom, it's me. Mom! Mom, let me in! Hello? Mom? Mom! Where are you? Mom!!! I'm leaving now. I'm leaving. Come on, Niki. You still have 70% to give when you're tired. 70%! Are you okay? My mom is dying. Me and Mom... I want us to be... ...as close as that mom and... ...her daughter, on the pier. I want us to like sleep in the same bed... ...and spoon and sleep like a little baby. Have you told her so? You need to communicate with her, Niki. You have to tell her about your needs. You have to say, like... "The child in me needs you to give me a hug." "The child in me needs you to give me a hug." Exactly. Where are you going? There's just something I have to do. -Hi. -Hi. ID? I need to talk to Alex. -Do you have an appointment? -No. Niki! Is something wrong? -Hey! -Where's the bathroom? -Don't run off, what's up? -For real, where is it? I'm so sorry. I mean, uh... -I didn't mean to... -Do you have the stomach flu? No, no. Sorry. Thanks. Sorry. Ugh, I got puke in my nose. -What did you want to tell me? -Just a sec. I have to go wash up a little. Here. Take some. Take lots. Do you want to go to the carwash with me after work? That gum isn't working. Yes it is. So you'll pick me up later? But you need to wash that out first. -You need to wash up a little too. -Just a little. Oops, sorry. -Look, I don't have the stomach flu. -Oh, okay. So don't worry. I'm leaving now. Hi, Rodrigo! Listen, I'm at Mom's so I can't talk long. No problem, I'll be quick. How are you? Fine. What's going on? I was just thinking, maybe you and I should visit these therapists... ...they're supposed to be amazing and they work in pairs. -About the baby thing, I mean . -Okay, sounds fun. Really? God that makes me happy. Sure, this way we can get some closure. Right. Wait, what? Text me the time and place, see you there. Bye. Gold wash! And: included! -Okay? -Okay! I think I pulled something. Feels like a cramp. What are you doing tomorrow? I don't know. -Supposed to be great weather. -Yeah? Want to do something? We could grab lunch. What the hell? Okay. See you tomorrow. Yeah. -Bye. -Bye. Mom, I need to poop! Mom, I need to poop! Stop it, I can't deal with this! Stop it, Tuva! Sorry, could you just hold the baby for a minute? The poop is coming! I think the poop is in my pants, Mommy. Good. Stand by the stroller. Stop, Tuva, stay here! Fuck. -Do you have kids? -No. No? Don't do it. Thanks for agreeing to come. -Why this place? -I heard they're the best. Hey, can we not mention that I'm pregnant? -Promise me. -Okay, I promise. Thanks. So how does it feel to be here? It feels...I mostly feel open, I think. It feels good. So, would you like to tell us why you're here? Well, we have a special relationship... ...a special...arrangement, or whatever. I've been his mistress for two years. -Mistress sounds so... -Okay, well... -We've been having sex for two years. -How does it sound? I don't know. I value this relationship so much... ...and that word makes it sound cheap. Because this is also good for my relationship with my partner. Except she thinks it only happened once. Yes...but... I don't really want to bring her into this since she's not here... ...to share her perspective. So I'd prefer to leave her out of it. Out of respect for her. So your family is better off... ...because you have a mistress? Yes. Or because this other relationship helps me feel... ...more energized or dynamic or... -...present. -Sure. We can certainly get fresh energy from...extra relationships. Yes. So that's that. Lucky you. I do feel pretty lucky. But, Niki, you're feeling ready to take this to the next level. Is that right? No, I...No... No, I was thinking more like... ...we could move on... ...some other way. You're ready to be done? -Yes...no, I mean... -What are you saying? Do you know what I think? I think there's someone else. -He's the cheater, not me. -I've never cheated on you. Never. Hold on, is there someone else? What is this? Well? Now? While you were with me? Then what are we doing here? I wanted us to bring this to a positive end. -Shit. -Rodrigo, how does this make you feel? It just makes me so fucking sad. I can see that. And we're having a baby too. We're having a child. We weren't going to mention it, but... -A baby. -But we don't know if we are. No, but I want to. This feels like such a damn betrayal. Unfortunately, our time is up. Do you know what? We have an emergency hotline. A per-minute fee, and you just call in. And I'll be there for you anytime. The easiest thing to do is book a time online. -That puts you ahead of... -What, is this included in the price? ...those who call in. Yes, if you register, it does. Plus the per-minute fee. So many people sit here and have no idea where to go from here. So I like to say: www-dot... Thank you so much for coming in today. Thank you. So, what? Are you just going to tell this Alex that you're having my baby? Well? Does he even know you're pregnant? -No. -So it'll be part of the deal later? I don't know. I haven't thought about it. Hey... Shit, it just... It just feels so damn right. -Hi. -Hey there. The usual? -Can you feel it? -I pre-ordered. No. We're not together, even if it looks that way. -Let go. -No. No! Let go! Let go. Yes, right. Exactly...yes... -Mom! -I'll let you know. Hi, Mom. I just wanted to say... ...that there's a child inside me that... ...needs a hug. MOM!!! Mom! Mom, listen! Hello! Can't you see she's trying to talk to you?! She's trying to communicate! I want a hot dog! -Hello? -Hi, Mom. Hi. Do you want to have breakfast at my place tomorrow at 10? Okay. Hello? -What are you doing? -You can't walk around like this. Didn't you know Grandma had to have her toe amputated? What time is it? 8:30. I was a little early. You brought milk? Yes, I didn't know if you would have any. -Where's the coffeemaker? -Behind you. Can't you just sit down, Mom? There. Well, now...have a bun! Have a bun. Don't you have work today? I don't want to keep you. I won't stay long. But I don't want you to go. I want you to stay with me. Well...then I'll stay. Can't I have a hug? -I have to use the bathroom. -No! -I have to use the bathroom. -I don't want you to go. Stop, I have to go. No, I want you to sit down! Rodrigo. Hi. -Do you want to meet up? -What, now? -Now, my place. -I can't. Tomorrow. Great, bye . Bye. -Why do you suddenly need that? -You know, there are so many diseases. Come on. Choke me. Harder, come on, choke me! Hello? Hello! Rodrigo! Hello? Shit. -You have to give the signal! -Oh shit, that was amazing. Oh damn. Ow. Oh, fuck. Hey...I was so happy you called. It really feels like the worst has blown over. Okay. I think she's forgiven me and stuff. -Is it okay if I give this to Maggie? -To Maggie? She and her wife really want a baby. Okay, if you promise you won't tell them it's mine. I promise not to tell. I'm not going to tell anyone about this one either. What? I'm keeping it. I have to go now. -Hi. -Hi. Here. -Whose is it? -Rodrigo's. Good choice. He's got great genes. No drunks or anything. -Both parents still alive and healthy. -Thanks. So I did some math... you're ovulating, right? Yes. Not to stress you out, but you should use it right away. Before they die. Like, now. By the way, I forgot to mention. I'm pregnant. Sweetie...you have to call if you're not coming home. Liv, your bag. Hi. Hi. Hop in. Mom's in the hospital. -Are you heading there now? -Yes. Can I come? She...doesn't want to see you right now. Niki, please, can't we... -Promise not to argue. -I never argue. -Not a word, okay? -Well, I have to talk. -Yes, but no arguing. -What's the difference? -Just promise you won't argue, okay? I promise. Is it okay if we go in first, while you wait? I'm sorry. Can't you...sit right here? Beside me. I don't know why things ended up this way between us. It was like this from the start. I didn't believe that... that I could love you. But I can. I just don't know how to say anything. Everything I say is wrong. And I hurt you. I don't mean to. I care about you, Niki. I do. Oops. Don't let me interrupt. I'm sorry, I just have to say... ...it's so nice to see a mother and daughter together. Okay. Everything okay? What? -Everything okay? -Yes. I'll come back tomorrow. Niki! Hi, Niki! Niki? What's wrong? What's going on? Toot toot! I can't stop thinking about you. I should have called right away. -Do you want a massage? -I have to go. -No. Don't go. -I have to. -Can you at least call? -Okay. -Promise. -Yeah. Fuck. Niki. Look. Congratulations! Thanks. I bought two different sizes. I read you can't be sure how big the baby is until it's born. Have you thought about what kind of stroller you want? I think I want one of those Danish ones. Really big. Niki? That's her. -I'll wait here. -No. Let's see here. -Maybe I'm not even pregnant. -Well... See that little dot there? Listen. That's the heart beating. They'll be siblings, Niki. Our kids are going to be siblings. Our kids are going to be siblings. Does she know we're here? Oh yes. She can tell. Shall I do you up? You don't have a mustache. You're going to be a grandma. A little girl. We are gathered here today to say farewell to Sofia Vogel. Beloved mother, grandmother... ...relative, friend, and neighbor. and with another grandchild on the way. Let's listen to a song Stina liked... ...I'm sorry, Sofia liked very much. Sorry. I'm sorry. Take a moment to let your mind and body relax. Set all your thoughts and problems aside. Right now, there's nothing you need to figure out. Right now... REALLY WANT TO TALK. SORRY. ...you are just here. PLEASE CALL -Did he answer yet? -No. So why don't you just go over there? Just do it. Look. Alex! -What the hell are you doing? -Sorry. I just wanted to say I slept with Rodrigo... ...and I'm having his baby and keeping it, but... ...but that's over and I've tried to forget you so many times ...but now I know I never will and I sleep with your shirt every night! That's all I wanted to say!
