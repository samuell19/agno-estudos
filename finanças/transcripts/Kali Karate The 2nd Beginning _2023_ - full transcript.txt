This is the greatest comeback story of all time. The rise and fall and rise again. - Do I look good? - You look great. Do I look rich? Of one of the greatest warriors/action stars that has ever walked on this planet. Whoa! A dimensional traveler who will never die. A spirit who's a true SENSAI. Kali Karate! The 2nd Beginning! SENSAI Houston. The 2nd Beginning! I can't be stopped! I am the chosen one! I like turtles! SENSAI Houston here. How's it going, fans across the world? Looks like I made it. Am I right? A lot of people said that I blackmailed my way to the top. That's not true, okay? All I did was I videotaped someone doing something in secret, and then I threatened to release that video unless they paid for my talk show. Yeah, yeah. I'm the guy that, uh, SENSAI's blackmailing. I'm a family man for God's sake. I'm a successful businessman. I'm gonna let this guy ruin my life? I don't think so. Listen, that's the world these days, okay? You got to take advantage of opportunities. And you gotta take advantage of people. Especially rich people. I'm rich as shit now and I got no qualms about any of that. -I'm-- -Why do I always have to do your dirty dishes? -From now on, from this month, you paying my rent! -I'm not gonna pay your rent! -What are you talking about? -Now, why should I do your dirty dishes for free? Because I'm gonna use the dishes again! That's why I don't do it 'cause if I'm-- -We share! -Listen-- You're-- So you wash every time! You're embarrassing me! Hello, my name is Shu Luan. In Chinese, it means pretty orchid. My mother had high hope. -Oh, yeah? Okay? -Yeah! I'm drawing the line here. You know, you are the worst roommate. You don't wash the dishes and you always have somebody coming in and going out like a café or, you know, a restaurant or something. - There's no cleanliness, okay? - Sorry, sorry I hang out with a lot of women. Sorry a lot of women come over. Yeah. Look at the quality of the women, you know? Yeah, "woman." If you can call her that. I'm ready to rock and roll. I'm ready to, to make the greatest action talk show that this world has ever seen because they've never seen anything like this before. I will bet you money on that. - On the season premiere of Beach Kumite. SENSAI must kill everyone in order to survive. Finish him! Tomorrow may never come. So kill today. I'm standing here outside the home of SENSAI Houston. Houston is the star of the new action series Beach Kumite. We've just received word that the series has been canceled after only one episode due to allegations of sexual misconduct between himself and a network producer's wife. It's been quite the roller-coaster year for the SENSAI. He lost three consecutive fights by disqualification to seven-time world champion Peter "Sugarfoot" Cunningham. We were lucky enough to get Mr. Cunningham's thoughts on the matter. Y-- You be sitting there, you know what I'm saying? Things, things are going good. He's scratching your eye. And when he gets you inside, watch your ass. - You think, "Well, I'm close. - can't reach and scratch my eye," and he'll grab your dick. He grabbed my dick! Huh? If-- I can barely see. Where you at? Sometimes you stand there you go, "Ooh, what's that?" 'Cause, you get-- you know, you think somebody grabbing your dick. Because you remember, that-- it's trauma. The real question is, how will SENSAI pivot from this? Live reporting, I'm Leslie Green. SENSAI produced and financed a self-defense series with his student Coen Mahoney. Whoo! Get the fuck out of here! Yeah! Ahead of its time and way too good, it unfortunately bankrupted both of them. Coen hasn't really been talking to me lately. Um... We had a disagreement on money. He's got a new girlfriend which doesn't help. One two. One two, one two. Okay! Hey, everyone! Yes, I am so excited to, uh, get working on the talk show and hopefully make some of this money back that SENSAI has lost me in the past. Um, that's all right. And I'm actually working on my PSA segments as we speak, so I think it's gonna be a really great thing. I really do. SENSAI, uh, he's promised me a, a full DJ booth. Are you getting that? - Yeah, I got it. - Is it focused? -Oh, yeah. -You sure it's focused? Yeah, for some reason, this must be a, a, a close-up lens. It's looking kind of small. -What? -No, nothing. -Then change the f-- -You look great. -Change the fucking lens then. -You look great. We've already agreed that Spike is going to direct the show. And then I'm just gonna pay him. So how did you get involved with the, the at-risk teen program? Well I didn't get involved with it. It wasn't my choice. They just had me do it after some bullshit happened. I now have a troubled teen youth program for young little kids who, uh, don't know how to live in the world by themselves and they need uh, a role model to help them get through life. I stabbed my dad with a fork or whatever. It was plastic, but it was a strong one, so it's just like whatever. It's better to be alive than dead. We're having a bunch of meetings with producers today. Just about talent... ...that I'm gonna bring on with the show. I'm just gonna-- I will handle all the payments for everybody. Yeah guys, I mean, listen, in a perfect world - the talk show's gonna be a major hit, right? - -Uh-huh. It's gonna bring a lot of eyes back on to me - so I can bring Beach Kumite back. - -That'd be awesome. And with, uh, Beach Kumite back on the air, um, I can definitely get my ex-wife Jessica back because listen, guys, no matter how many times you fuck up in life... - Uh-huh. - ...women don't care. It, it, it just depends on how successful you are, you know? - Right. - -So anyway, tune in this Wednesday. Uh, the season premiere is coming out. We have Muay Thai champ, uh, Vinny Fam. - Uh, opening up the season. - We know Vinny Fam. So, uh, yeah, it's gonna be a banger. All right, you heard him, listeners. Check out SENSAI's new show, the Kali Karate Show, dropping this Wednesday at 8:00 p.m. We'd love to see SENSAI back with Jessica obviously. They're a powerful couple. Jessica, just pick up my phone calls, okay? I really, really want to see you and I want to see the kids, okay? And I, I have my own talk show now. And I'm making a lot of money. I want to support you guys. Now in my life, I know I wasn't in the past, but now the idea of monogamy sounds doable. And it sounds like it could maybe work out. Shortly after his divorce, SENSAI started recording hot tracks because he is a true romantic. His songs are sexual, progressive, and heavily Jessica-inspired. ♪ And we rapping and we rocking And we doing the popping ♪ ♪ Because we're rocking The streets ♪ ♪ Yeah, we're doing the beats ♪ ♪ And I got my, my friend Shu ♪ ♪ And she's gonna stab you And we gonna do this ♪ ♪ Like we should've always done this ♪ ♪ '90s beats, hip-hop streets ♪ ♪ Because we running this And we running the streets ♪ ♪ I got Kali Karate, SENSAI Houston and Shu ♪ ♪ Yeah, we're doing this ♪ ♪ And you know what we do ♪ ♪ Because we in the streets ♪ That's what I'm talking about, dawg.

Yeah, I was at this party and this group of five guys jumped me, man. Five to one! I don't know where the hell he came from, but SENSAI Houston came out of nowhere and whipped all five of these guys' asses like it was nothing. Like it was nothing. Man, I wouldn't be here talking to you right now if it wasn't for SENSAI Houston. We came here to battle! Round One. Go! And fucking action or whatever. Introducing the undisputed world champion! SENSAI Houston! Whoo! Okay, so today we have Vinny Fam. He is the IFS... ...Welterweight Champion. -Muay Thai, correct? -Yes. Vinny, I mean, we go back a lo-- a long way. Right? Remember when I used to spar with you and I used, I used to teach you all those-- -No. -Yes. What? - Hey, SENSAI. Hey. - What? What's up? - How are you? - Good, what's going on? It's, uh, it's 11:20. Our appointment? -For, uh-- -Oh, fuck! I literally called you to confirm last night. -And I'm literally in the middle of my own fucking talk show. -This would be strike three. Okay, and I'm about to strike you once if you don't get the fuck out of my face. - Okay, I'll call you. - -It's three grand, I'm just telling you. -Three grand? For what? -Yes! We had two sessions a week. -No, I'm not paying you shit! -That's three grand. It's three grand. - Three grand, three grand, three grand. - Fuck. So why did you pick Muay Thai out of all the martial arts forms? Uh, you know what? I first started striking. The first time I ever jumped in the ring I jumped in. I had my mitt man Steve D.L.P. - Fuck that guy. - Uh... Uh, yeah, um-- Read about SENSAI Houston's road to success in our first ever comic book SENSAI Houston: The Beginning. Did you cut your fucking nails like I asked you to? - No. I can go like that. Okay. - No, it looks stupid. - You ever shit your pants before a fight 'cause you're so scared? - Right? - Yeah. Yeah, 'cause I see how Steve's been teaching you and he's teaching you very straight on, one angle. I'm, I teach hundreds of angles. Uh, Steve's just a little... He's a little full of himself. I can make you world champion. Uh. Yeah. - Sure. - I agree. -He's my star pupil. -Got it. -Yeah. -Got it, and how long have you guys been training? -That's none of your business. -Ah. Excuse me. Is there anything that you've had to give up? Yeah, there was a lot of sacrifice, you know? - I had to, uh, time away from, uh, -you know, the kids. -So you like having kids? - Uh, yeah, I love having kids, yeah. Okay. Hmm-mm. - You gonna get your kids-- - That's inspiring, Vinny. -Okay, are you host? -No. -You know? -Yeah. -Have you ever been badly hurt? -Uh, yeah, like I said, I tore my meniscus in my last fight and-- - Meniscus? - Yeah. I've seen a lot of people with meniscus issues. Uh, it's the left knee? Yeah, it was the left knee. - Okay. - Ethan. - Doing good now? - Ethan! Ethan! -Ethan! -Doing pretty good? -Ethan! -Yes, SENSAI? -Can you...? -Oh. Yeah. -Well, I'll give you my card. And-- -Okay, Ethan, what the f-- why'd you like-- Dude, come on, man. -I was-- -You're in the middle of my talk show. -I'm asking a question. -You have a business. -Yeah. What's your business? -I-- None of my, none of my business, I guess, but-- No, I'm good. We can end this early. -Okay. -And I'll pay you for half. -Do you have Venmo? -Yeah, I'm on Venmo. So we'll do the full, full cost of 300. I can't find you on here. It's-- I'll do it later. No, no, you've literally paid me before. -Yeah, phone's frozen. -Buy my book! It's, it's not frozen. I can see the screen, dude. -Alright, fucking pay yourself. -Okay. - You can use mine, SENSAI. -Shut up, Coen. For true legal purposes, I'm gonna need you to press okay. -Okay, good, see? -Thank you. I'm gonna decline that later. - Sorry about that. - Watch the mic. -Watch the mic! -It's not my fucking job, Spike! Jesus fucking Christ. -Want me to get my card? -Okay, just go! -Sorry. -Coen, can you open the door for him? All right. Can we get a photo of this? You can s-- It's okay, we'll get-- Just stand right... Back up a little bit? Right there. People are always trying to use me. Hey, uh, before we do this, real quick, can you just sign this c-- video consent form? A lot of papers for a video consent. -A hundred-- -That's okay, just sign right at that back page. That looks like the fight contract you made me sign, SENSAI! Okay, Coen, shut the fuck up. I'm sorry for cursing at you. "I, Vinny Fam, will pay 70%--" - "I, Vinny Fam, will pay 70%--" To SENSAI Houston. -My per-- -Okay, that's fine. We'll just, uh, we'll, we'll take care of this after. -Steve's a bum. -That's my coach. And I'm a SENSAI. Let's see what you got. So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna step in with the jab cross up top raising SENSAI's guard. It will leave the body exposed. - I will left hook to the liver... ...dropping the guard, going back up top. Cross hook. Finishing off leg kick. That would never work. That's just such a-- Okay. -Okay, let's go. -Okay, now we're gonna go real speed and... Oh, fucking asshole! Oh, God! - Game over. - -Oh, shit, where did that hit? - I'll walk you out, thanks for coming. You were great. Don't worry about him, he's a piece of shit. Ungrateful. After everything I've done for you. And now, uh, let's listen to Coen's segment of the show. - And now for our PSA of the day, animal cruel-- I feel so bad for him. He has so many wives and kids. I called all my wives to see if any of my kids wanted to come. Hey, Ruby. Stacy. Laura. Hey, Shanai. Jessica, please pick up my fucking phone calls. Argh! Are we rolling? Oh, okay, yeah. Um, so, you know, I love, I love my kids. Silent Wolf! Max, Maximus! Maximus! Maximus! Maximus! You know, when you have kids, you legally have to keep them alive. And when you don't believe in condoms or pulling out, this is what you get, you know? This week on Beach Kumite. Too much cocaine? What has he gotten himself into? Everyone must die. Who's better, mommy or daddy? -Hey, hey. -Mommy. -What? What'd you say? -Mommy. Mommy. So gotta put food on the table, right? Stop it! Stop it! Stop, sit up here. They brighten up my day. So I don't know where I'd be without them. Probably a lot richer. A lot more free, you know? But... ...it is what it is.

I'm a comedian, uh... ...as you can tell by this casting couch I'm doing very well. - Uh, so the way I met SENSAI Houston, I do this stand-up character named Barry McGuthry Jr. It's like this southern guy and people don't know if it's real or fake. I'm at a stand-up open mic. He marches on stage under the name SENSAI Houston. He's, he's wearing this gi, this full gi the whole time, and he starts complaining about his divorces and his kids. Uh, at one point, he starts crying and I'm like, "This guy is, like, going for it." SENSAI decided to visit his son Landon who he hasn't spoken to in three years. Landon happens to work at his loser stepdad Kevin's Poke Bar, who also happens to be Jessica's new husband. I'm here to get my kid back. For the record, SENSAI completely forgot that Kevin had a restraining order against him. - Hey, what's going on? - No! - Hey, brah. - What's up? -What's up, pops? -Good to see you, man. How you been? - Why aren't you picking up my phone calls, huh? - -Hey! -Oh, you wanna go? -Hey! You have a res... You want to fight? Boy? -...training order. Hey! -You wanna go? -Argh! That's what I'm talking about. -That's-- Why haven't you picked up my-- Oh, shit! thudding] You motherfucker! You motherfucker! You motherfucker! Fucker! You're gonna fucking make me some poke, bitch! You're gonna make me some poke, you motherfucker! Fuck. - Hmm. - Gross. You know beer has got the best protein to carbs ratio? -It's good to see you. -It's been three years. I know, time's flown by. You got a lot bigger. You know that that guy's not your real dad, right? You came from my balls. You're my son, okay? Just because he pays your bills and, you know, takes care of your mom, and gives you a job, and, you know, is there for you emotionally and supportive, doesn't mean he's your dad. I'm your dad, okay? -Now I've got my own talk show. -Oh, you got your own talk show? I got my own talk show now. I want you to come to the talk show. -Talk-- -I called, I called your mom. I have my own talk show. Oh, your mom-- I'm famous now. -Famous? -Yeah. You're about to see me on billboards. You're about to see me all over the place. Car wraps. What? You're not gonna be on any car wraps. Yeah, people are gonna get car wraps of me. All right, well, I can't bullshit anymore. I gotta get outta here. It's good to see you. I want you to stop by the show, okay? If you're free, I'd like for you to come by sometime. Listen, I love you. Okay? You're the best. I love you. I love you so much. "I love you too, Dad!" Remember, that guy's a douchebag. I'm your dad. Tell him I said thanks for the beer! Thanks for the beer. And thanks for the spar se-- Okay, fuck you too, man. I'm out of here. Let's go. He recommends this bar 'cause he knows the bartender who I would later find out was one of his ex's or, or something. But we're, we're chatting it up and I'm like, "Dude, that was so great and refreshing." And he doesn't take his sunglasses off at any point. Now, let me tell you. Women... Not the kind of women you bring in here. -They're beautiful, what are you talking about? -Yeah. - They're beautiful? - Yeah, they're beautiful. Hey, hello! You need to double check your vision. I mean, even my age, my look, I can surpass them, okay? Other than my boobs. Yeah, they, they only got boobs. That's all you want. They have-- No, they have hearts too. They're, they're-- - Do you know what they are that you're not? - Yeah, right. -They're good listeners. -No! -They listen. -They-- No, they don't listen! They just want to come in and have you do your things. -Did you, did you lock the door? -Yeah, that's that. -Hey! -You're pissing me off. -Unlock the door so I can leave. -I told you. He, he was showing me how to gouge someone's, uh, fucking eyes out, so. Best thing that you can have in a street fight is a sword. No questions asked. -Psst. -Bam! Ahh! No chance of surviving after that. Die! Die! Die, die! Die, die, die! Die, die! - You wanna be successful? - Yeah. Have a lot of sexual partners. You wanna fail? Just have one. Hey, Stacy, I would love to see you and Timmy. Please pick up. This is where I first started training by myself. - Because so many people were terrified of me they didn't want to spar with me. So the next best thing was for me to spar trees. That's why my bones are so tough now. You know, you try kicking a tree thousands of times a day. You try scratching, you try punching a tree thousands of times a day. You're gonna have some pretty strong fingers and knuckles. Sometimes the advantage is not having anybody in life. Fight! No, I like that. No, more explosions! I want more explosions! -I do not know how to do that. -Yes you do! SENSAI fired the editing team. And made Shu head supervisor of postproduction. -Bigger explosions on the-- -What do you mean? -I don't know how to do it. -More Matrix style. -I wanna-- -I just tell you I don't know how to do it! - I want it-- -Oh, yeah. - I used to watch SENSAI fight all the time. Yeah, he was actually a bit of a YouTube sensation for a little while. I would try to, you know, study his movements. Anything I could. I don't know what happened, you know? I mean, there was the six divorces obviously. Multiple children, he was in and out of prison. There was the mortgage fiasco. Can you unlock it for me? I'm gonna walk out -'cause you're annoying me. -I annoying you? You know, if you don't lock your door, somebody may come in. -Yeah, I hope s-- -That's a very dangerous thing to do! I hope someone tries to come in this house 'cause I'll fucking kill them. Yeah, right. Look at you, skinny guy. - Skinny legs. Yeah, skinny arms. - Timing and precision. -Who can you kill? -Timing, timing and precision. Yoga's got a lot of hot chicks. You know, it's kind of the easiest way to meet a girl. And, you know, I want someone who's just spiritually in tune, uh, open-minded, and wh-- who has great thighs. Open up those arms. Push those shoulder blades down your back. Ears away from shoulders. Stick out that butt, tuck that tailbone. -Melt that chest, o-- -Yeah, no, I go-- I just got here. I'll call you back. -Okay I gotta go. Bye, bye, bye, bye. -Uh, hey, hey, hey. Whoa, you can't, you can't smoke in here, man. -I can't smoke in here? -This is a yoga studio. -Of course you can't smoke in here. -Okay. Uh, all right. -Are you here for yoga? -Yeah, where should I go? -Uh, right, right there. -Okay. -You're here for-- -Yeah, I'm here for yoga class. 'Sup? Okay. Okay, let's all try to root those feet in the mat. Let's open up those arms. Uh, mister, we're gonna move ni-- nice and slow. - Just follow along. - Okay. Great. Swan dive down past. Let's inhale. Broga is a, it's a creation of, yeah, what we like to think of as a men's collective. Did you-- - Did you just spit? - Yeah. Hey, man, you can't spit on the mat. Oh, oh, okay, well. I'll clean it up after. - O-- Okay? - Okay. Really try to create a safe space where we can scratch both our masculinity and open up to our femininity. Pelvis push into the mat. Crawl those shoulder blades onto your back. Let's go all the way. - What are you doing now? - Yeah, I'm doing it. I'm doing exactly what you're showing me to do. - Let's tuck those toes. - Let's keep-- -Oww! My fucking calves are killing me. You know what? I'm so sorry. - Uh... - What? I never have done this, but I think maybe this class isn't for you. What are you fucking looking at? You're kicking me out? You're trying to pick fights with other students. -Yeah man, get the fuck out of here! -Hey, hey, hey, hey! He's fucking looking at me the whole time. -Fuck you! -Hey, hey, hey, I have this. -Okay, it's time for you to-- -What, are you trying to hide? -He's fucking filming me. -Is this, is this guy with you? Yeah he's with me. I'm filming a TV series. -He was looking at me! I don't like that! -Hey, man, -you gotta turn off the camera. -Where, where are the girls at? That's all I know. -I'd like-- -You signed up for something called Broga! - There are no girls in this space. - -Safe space for bros! - Yoga and bros! - -You, You-- It's not gonna be a safe space if you get close to my fucking face, dude! You're gonna be in the danger zone! -I'm trying to reset here. -If you try the poses, it's not that bad. Hey, dude, you're really sweet and everything, you're a really nice guy, but just please leave me alone. -You guys, I, I think I got this. He's on his way out. -You got? -You sure? -Let's just take some deep breaths. Totally. -How's the series going? -It's going great. -What's-- What's it about? -I'm making a lot of money. Uh, it's about, um, I am a talk show host and I interview celebrities and people who do martial arts, so. -Who, what? -I'm, I'm, I'm an actor. Oh, you wanna be on the show. -I think I could help the show, you know? -Okay. Uh, are you gonna be, are you gonna be here tomorrow? -Yeah, I'm here teaching fuckers down dog all day. -Two o'clock? -Two o'clock. -All right, I'll be here at two o'clock tomorrow to come talk to you about being on the show. -Okay, that's awesome. -Yeah. Look and I, you know, look, again-- You'll be on episode eight. -Episode eight? -Episode eight. Okay, so this is, this is a series that's been going for a while. -Has some legs. -Yeah. I'll have my manager and my lawyer, -uh, reach out to you. -That sounds awesome. I got six ex-wives though, I will tell you that. That is a number I will not forget. 'Cause that is... ...six times I've had my heart broken. Now, it's almost impossible if, if it's sunk in too deep. But there is a way to get out of it if you can. First what you do is you try to... -Oh, sorry. -That, that's okay. -Oh, that's nice, you're blocking your hands. -Yes. -Oh, am I-- -Don't do that, 'cause it makes it harder, -harder for me to get out of it. -Oh, yes, yes, yes. Um, so, come on. It's gotta look real, but not, you know. -Let, let me get out of it. -Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'm ready to be famous again. Because I will tell you. Not being famous is not fun. I'm unlocking door number one. Door number two is right here. What's behind door number two? I don't fucking know. Don't ask me, okay? It's-- Coen's upset with me and... Jessica won't... She won't even pick up my calls anymore. Pry door number two open. Now I can breathe a little bit. I can talk to people, you know? Um, now what I want to do is I can dig my elbow into their inner thigh. Very painful for them. I've just been getting prostitutes. And they won't say "I love you" to me. And that's all I wanna hear sometimes. I can take what I like to call my hammer fist and hammer on Coen's face as hard as I want. 'Cause chicks dig scars, but chicks dig winners more. Argh! Argh! I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm gonna go for a walk. Ok-- Okay. Okay? Oh, yeah. Oh, no. Oh, God. And there he goes. You say it was Martin? What's going on, man? Nothing. -Want one? -Uh, yeah. So today we have Kiki. She's an ex-rockstar turned famous travel blogger and Insta model. And... Martin. Thanks for coming in. Kiki likes to travel, am I right? Yes. I definitely do. - Where's your favorite spot you've been to? -Um, I actually was just in Peru. -Really? -What were you doing there? -Um, I was actually exploring a little bit. We went with friends. Yeah. So I thought you were single. Um, No, no, I've, I've been in a relationship for seven years now. -Seven years? -Yeah. -With the same guy? -Uh, yeah, with Martin here. Seven years. Yeah, Peru was amazing, - Um... - Seven years. Holy shit. That's a long fucking time. Motherfucker. Martin, what do you do? -I'm a tattoo artist. -Like as a hobby or...? As a living. Let's look up Martin right now and see what kind of tattoos he likes to do. - That looks really nice. - Okay, Coen. Stick to DJing. Thank you. -Are you rewrapping those? -Huh? Did you just rewrap one of the lollipops? Yeah, I save them all for later. Oh. You guys smoke? Um, not really. Oh, fucking-- 420, bro. Smoking. That was good. Um... Ooh. -Chicken wing? -Uh, no, I'm good, thanks. -You sure? -Yeah. - You want one? Come on. - I'm all right, man. -Have one. -I've seen what you do with the lollipop. Take one. Too slow. I don't know if you can tell, but I'm looking right at you. -Ruff! -Oh, fuck! I almost choked. That was scary. I'm not hungry anymore. Ooh. Whoa. -You okay? -It hurts. What kind of martial arts do you do? -Uh, we practice Muay Thai. -Both you guys? - Yeah. - You do it together? Uh, yeah, all the time. Are you happy? Yeah. That's nice. I'm at that point where I'm too stoned. We've been through this, SENSAI. You have to do the move-- Why do I have to do the move after every time? -Maybe I don't wanna do the move. -It's a martial arts show. Just hurry the fuck up! -Come on, Kiki. Come on, Kiki. -Nah, yeah. -I'll take this one. -Nah, we're good. Kiki, come on. -Nah, nah, it's all right, man. I'll take it. -No, it's cool. -Nah, nah, it's-- -Nah, you know, I'm not really feeling it. -Come on, Kiki. -That's all right. Nah, nah, she, she's fine. Maybe Martin should do the move. No? -I'm doing the move, mate. -Okay, let's go, Martin. So let's see what your favorite move is, Martin. I usually like to, uh, to, like, set up the low kick by, like, jab, cross, and shift, and then low kick. - Okay, well... - Try that one out. ...once again, in a real situation I would take him down and beat the shit out of him. Let's see what we got. Oh, fucking asshole! - Oh, my dick is fucked. - Game over. - I think my shaft is broken. - You okay, SENSAI? No, fucking asshole! Aww! My balls exploded. - He sucker punched me there. You saw that. -That's not funny! -I am happy about that. I'm so sorry. -It's not funny! -I love to see other people punching you. Yeah, right, tofu brains, aw. I told-- Stop calling me tofu brains. You know I don't like when you call me that. Then stop being that. - So I get into my car and there's a box waiting for me in the car already, okay? In it, scissors. Zip ties. And rope. And, and then I get, like, and then I get a note, okay? "I'm stalking you now and I will make you pay. Enjoy the toys. Love, Stalker. P.S. Congrats on the show. I'm really happy for you." Later that night, SENSAI received these creepy violent videos from a stalker. SENSAI, this is your stalker. You're gonna pay. You might not remember me, but I tried training with you years ago. You turned me down for cash purposes. Maybe you even remember my wife, Stephanie? Ring a bell? God, I hate you. I got a stalker now. I'm getting, like, tons of death threats. Who's gonna be interested in you? - He said he's gonna sacrifice me. -Why's that funny? -Yeah, you are skin and bones. Even him up there would like to have somebody meaty. What happens if him and his sex cult come here and, and eat both of us? - How would you feel about that? - I will not be here. All right, I need your help. Shu, come here. -I'll be nice to you if you're nice to me. -Ha! -I'm always nice to you. -Yeah? Okay. Right there, five bucks. - Now, how are we going to coming and going? -What? - How are we going to coming and going? -Okay, it's good. - Uh? - Ugh! Yeah, this is, uh, Jessica and my old spot. You know, I paid for an eighth of it, so, so it's pretty much mine too and... Now she's got old Kev-o up there. Snuggling up to her at night. I wish I could go up there and, you know, stop them. Ha! So... ♪ I've told you so many times ♪ -♪ And I told you ♪ -♪ That nothing's gonna hold us now ♪ -♪ And I told you ♪ -♪ Nothing gonna stop us now ♪ SENSAI received another ridiculous lawsuit from bum-ass Kevin and Jessica. We came here to battle! I am SENSAI Houston's attorney. Uh, attorney at Law, uh, Mark Wheeler. I'm working with SENSAI Houston pretty much full-time. I don't think the restraining order's gonna help, so I've been, uh, closing the shop down early. Uh, getting the rounds in. Putting the time in. I know he's coming back. The guy just won't quit. I mean, we fought over ten times. I met SENSAI... Let's see, I used to train with him. Um, that's how I met his wife Jessica, um... Great gal. Uh, we've-- Ins-- Love at first sight, we fell in love. Jessica denied all of our attempts for an interview. This is mine! This is my place of business! I hope he finds true happiness and can just leave us alone. Uh, move on with his life. So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna teach you the, probably the one and only move that you need to know is a guillotine choke. You can use it at school, you can use it at bars-- -Oh, hang on, I don't think you should be saying that. -You can use-- -Okay. -Don't use it at school. Don't do that. -Don't fucking question me again. -You can be-- You, you want kids to get arrested -and try to choke each other out. -I will kill you. Right, let's just move on. -You just talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk. -Can we move on, please? -Can we move on? -You remind me-- Okay. God, okay. -Let me come down a little bit. -All right. -You're gonna put your arm like this. -Yep. -You're gonna grab your bicep with your other hand. -What? -Like this, yep. -Uh, I got it. -Like this? It's quite tight. -Yes, exactly. Yeah, okay. -That's tight, right? -Yeah. It's okay, you can go as hard as you want. -And once you-- -Well, I'm not gonna-- I don't wanna knock you out do I? What-- Oh, crap. Oh, I... - Has this happened before? - -Uh, no, I don't think so. Is he breathing? Shit. Coach, uh, SENSAI? SENSAI, I'm not gonna go in there and say that. -Why not? -I'm gonna go to jail! -No you're not. -Yes I am! -I'll blur your face out! -SENSEI you-- I've been selling, uh, SENSAI... uh, performance enhancing drugs for like... ...like, 20 years. What the fuck is that? -What the fuck is that? What-- -It's nothing. When have I ever gotten you in trouble before? Last week. Yeah, he's a, he's a good guy. One of my besties.

That place just takes me, takes to a special, you know what I mean? 'Cause, like... my life at home isn't, isn't what it's supposed to be. - You know what I'm saying? - So, my, my wife's cheating on me... I was... ...SENSAI Houston's number one student. - Okay. -So the thing is I broke one of my toes, so I had to sit back for a little while. Coen, he came, and he kind of took my spot. But I'm, I'm getting it back. You know what I'm saying? - Okay. - I'll fight him right now. What's up? Hey, how's it going, fans? I rushed down here to tell you, "Follow your dreams." 'Cause if not, the government will. I've been having a lot of copyright problems, so I've been recording everything I've been speaking. It's better to be alive than dead. Do you have any brain in there? Are they all tofus? All mashy. -Hey. -Hey, what's going on? Thank you for having me. It feels good to be back home. Who do we have today? -Uh-- -Jake Allyn. - Thank you, Jake Allyn. Today we have Jake Allyn. An aspiring actor new to LA. -I'm a real one. -So I know, you know, the industry is a very, very, very hard industry. -I know this-- it takes a long time, but... -Yeah. - ...you're a pretty average looking guy... ...and, uh, you'll be okay. - There's probably a lot of parts for people like you. There actually have been a lot of parts, uh, I've been able to work pretty consistently -the last three years. -You doing plays? Not really plays. I mostly work in movies and television. Short films kind of thing? -Nah, mostly network shows. -Web series? No. Like real television. -YouTube? -I don't know why you keep bringing it up. -Like, did you act or some shit? -Yeah, I am an actor. In what? This week on Beach Kumite. SENSAI must kill everyone. Tomorrow may never come. So kill today. - So what's, wh-- what's, what's the show... -Yo, Jane, what-- -Uh-- -...that you're doing? The show was called The Quad. -It was? -In Atlanta, yeah. So it's not, it's no more? Yeah, we went two seasons. Wow. Uh, I played a kid named, uh, BoJohn Folsom. I played the quarterback on the football team. Have you ever played sports? Yeah, I'm a martial artist. No, I mean like real sports. - Fuck sports! - -You're supposed to say "Jake" after. - Oh, I did under my breathe. - You fucking asshole. Coen, you here? Oh, shit. Dirty son of a bitch! Take your laundry out of the machine when you're done! -I know. -It stinking up the house! And there are many flies everywhere! -I'll be home in a little bit. Okay? -Is this like a Punk'd thing? -Don't wait up for me. -I see everything. -Thank you! -You freak! Women, dude. Right? Whatever. That's my sparring partner. She's obviously not your sparring partner. And my roommate. Leave me alone, Shu! -Want some whiskey? -Really? - Yes. - That hard? Yeah. And-- All right, let's go. - Slowly backing up. Na, na, na, na, na! - Bro, I think you need to work out your life. - I think you need to shut the fuck up. -I'm not gonna fight you, dude. -Let's see what you got. Come on. You see what I got, you kidding me? I'll put you into the fucking wall. -You ain't gonna do shit. -Come on. -Are you kidding me? -Okay. Okay, Jesus, you're good. Yeah, we're fine. We're fine. -You let him do that, right? -Yup. ♪ And the river ♪ ♪ And he jumped on the back of a... ♪ After a couple of beers and some Quaaludes, SENSAI called Coen to smooth things over. Oh. -Coen! -SENSAI! -Hey, what's going on? -How are you? -Hey, mom-- -Good, how are you? It's good to see you. Uh, sorry, guys, hold on one sec. I'm with my family like I told you. Maybe we could, uh, do this another time? Oh, that's nice, you're with your family. That looks nice. ♪ He was in love ♪ You can say hi to everyone.

I'm sorry about that, SENSAI. ♪ Because we all need love ♪ ♪ Sometimes ♪ -You look good. -Thanks, yeah, I've just been, you know, I've been missing you a lot and, uh, just hoping that we can, you know, move back in together. -So I don't know if you've thought about what I... -Yeah. -...what we talked about the other day, but, uh-- -Well... You... You see, the thing is I don't like to do this on camera -because you always film these. I, I know you're filming this. -I swer-- -I'm sure you are. -I swear to God I'm not filming this. -I see the camera in the back. -Okay, Jackson, why don't you mind your own business? - Um, I also see the camera, SENSAI. It's incredibly obvious. Oh, fuck, get, get out of the fucking shot. What are you doing? So I want, I want, like, a stoic shot, okay? - So you stay there... - Okay. ...and then when I turn around I'm gonna start walking. So please just answer my calls and get back to me. I've been do-- doing a thing called meditating a lot. I've been reading a lot of philosophy. I've been, uh, with this guy Plah-toe. And I have been studying my astrological charts. And I just-- I'm ready to be the man that you've always wanted me to be. So, uh, how do you know SENSAI? Uh, well, I met him at one of our wrap parties. His wife Jessica does makeup for us, so. - Today we have Hollywood superstar Noah Centineo! It's a hot day in Hollywood and my man wants a good cup of coffee and some Pirate Booty after a 14-hour shoot day, you know? But hey, overtime ain't bad, right? Shut the fuck up! Come out now. Coen, come out. Coen, did you not charge the fucking walkie-talkies? - No, SENSAI, my bad! - "My bad." What the fuck, dude? Preproduction, I gave you one thing to do! - Do, do you want me to come out now? -Yes! Sorry, Noah. Hi! Um, like, are you Noah? Um, yes, I, I am. I baked you this donut. That is so sweet of you. Sweet. You get it? - Uh, don't lose it. Keep going, keep going. Um, I want you to eat it in front of me. Uh, you, you know what? I actually, I have these pretzels, -but I will totally take it with me-- -Eat it now! Noah is what I like to call trapped! What's he gonna do? Break this little girl's heart? How selfish would that be? Instead he takes the donut, inspects it, breaks it open like any smart celebrity should. - Oh, my God, there's a razor blade in this-- Holy shit! There's a razor blade in there and this little bitch is a killer! -Aah! There's more where that came from! -There's no-- And there's no security here either! - Yes! Shoot that. - Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, are you okay, man? -Fuck, yes! -Uh, SENSAI told me to do that. You g-- -You good? -Crisis averted once again. -Was that really necessary? -I don't know. Noah, is staying alive a priority to you? Coen, write him a check. -What? For how much? -Uh, 20K. -$20,000? -Don't be, don't be a cheap ass, okay? We're gonna make millions off this. Noah, you're a doll. Thank you so much. Are you, are you rolling? Yeah? I'm the best. I'm the best at everything. I'm the best fighter. I'm the best talk show host. I'm the best lover. I'm the best companion. So are you telling me that you're trying to back out of the 15 year contract that we have with each other? This week on Beach Kumite. In life, it's not how many people you've killed. It's how and why. I'm not perfect. Nobody is. But I'm damn near close. I'm the best SENSAI. I am the SENSAI. I'm the one and only SENSAI. I'm feeling sick to my stomach, so maybe we'll finish this conversation some other time. -It's really more about the loyalty, you know? -I-- -Yeah. -I think-- I, I actually-- After the last fight, uh, we made a pretty good purse and so, you know, -obviously I hired new people onto the team and I think that-- -Who? Do a pan up from the feet up. To show my strong ankles and then come up to the chest. Technically, my new team says that I shouldn't be doing this with you at all. I'm actually kind of breaking other contracts as we speak. Well, I'd like to talk to your team. Well, just stand there. I'm gonna get the-- may as well take, take advantage of the beautiful background. - Okay, this is my shoot. - Yeah. Okay. - Go back to over here where you were before. - -Sure. Why don't you stand back over there and take advantage of the beautiful scenery? Great idea. I wish I thought of it myself. -You're living with Shu? -Yeah. Shu and I got a great place together. -Okay. Um, okay, how, how's that going? -It's great. She's great. Action. After falling in love, Shu decided to move out. In hopes of finding Jake. -You're gonna look where Jake lives? -Hmm. So you're gonna move in with Jake? I can't afford rent by myself, Shu. -Tofu brain, shit happens. -Shit happens. - That's your-- You think this is funny? -This is funny to you? -Yeah, of course. Love just happens. Anytime, anywhere. Am I-- I might just get lucky. Hee, hee, hee. - Get off, get off my property. Get off my property, Shu. Yeah, I'm eager to leave. Shut the camera off. You know, they gave me all this money for a crew and stuff. I don't mind holding a mic. Like, why don't I just pocket the money? People just don't know how to do business these days, you know? They're so lazy that they need other people to do things. Like, I can edit. I can do sound. I can mix. I'm the head talent. I can write. I can produce. I can do wardrobe. Pff, that's like eight paychecks. Talent scout, casting, animation, editing, postproduction supervisor, voice-over. Stunts. Crafty.

So if he wants to employ me doing the shenanigans for this stalker that he has. Probably someone he fucking owes money to. You may be asking yourself why I'm in a sauna. It's a lot hotter in hell, SENSAI. SENSAI went ahead and sued Jake for being a bully. He's got a little case coming up. A little case-a-roo. One of his guests, uh, on the show, you know, pulled some stuff and we're gonna get, we're gonna get, we're gonna get paid. It's gonna be 19, 20, 21, 25, 31,000 bucks coming in to us. And I could use it. It was instantly denied by the judge because the judge was compromised and is a complete embarrassment to the judicial system. I have a tent. A nice tent that I c-- sleep in, so that's nice for now. It's just a squirrel. I think we're fine. We're okay. Shit. -Hey. -Hey! SENSAI! What's up? What's going on? How's it going?

So-- -Okay. -I've been checking it all week. -Okay, uh-- - Did you touch my black belt? - -I didn't touch your fucking black belt. Okay. I'm not saying you did.

Terrible. Stacy showed up. -Who's Stacy? -My ex-wife. Yeah, she's pregnant. Uh, congratulations, man. That's great news, right? -No, I've got way too many kids now. -Oh, okay. And the weird thing about it is I haven't had sex with her in over a year. So I don't get it. -Right. -I guess miracles do happen, -but I don't want this one, you know? -Right. -Are you hungry? Do you want anything? -Yes, I will take food. -You've been doing a great job, by the way. -I appreciate it. Yeah, I feel nice and safe with you out here all the time. -All right. -I appreciate it. I'm glad I could be of service. -I'm gonna give you more money too. -Really? -I'll think about it. -Okay. -I-- Should I come inside with you? -No, stay outside just so you can make sure no one comes in. Yeah, it's really nice having Ken watching the house 24 hours a day. Helps me sleep at night. If the stalker shows up, he'll have to kill Ken first and Ken's screams will probably wake me up. -I'm an actor! -How, how are we gonna have a think tank here and, and build an empire if you can't do your part? My part is acting! I can't wait to have you on, on the eighth episode. You're gonna do so good. So good. You know what? Ah, he's the best. Mmmm. You're so good at what you do. But you gotta do better than that. What's up? Um, much like this dried-up riverbed, life can be the same. So you need to forcibly fill it with money, love, intimate relationships, sex. If you don't love yourself, then you-- no one else can love you. And that's what I try to tell my students all the time is, "You have to love yourself." So, I definitely still miss Jessica. It's funny, it's been a while, so you would think that you would get over it. But sometimes things that are that important in your life will never leave you. And if you don't get it back, you'll be depressed forever. No matter what you do. I, I remember, ahem, when, uh, Jessica used to come here. I used to take her here, and we used to camp, and we'd swim in the river. Ahem, and we'd have wine and cheese, and we'd get all drunk, and we would make funny jokes, uh, at each other. And it was fun. Uh, it's weird when you start talking about these things. They bring back nostalgic memories, and you hate that feeling. Fuck off! Fucking dick! Fucking bitch! I twisted my ankle! You're doing such a great job! But you gotta do better, but you're so awesome at it. You're so good. You're so-- Mmmm. I, I love you so much. Coyotes! Coyotes! Dude, I'm not even, I'm not even fucking kidding. I saw a pack of coyotes, come on. I'm serious, dude. Let's go. Fuck you guys! Whoa, what's that? Oh, my God. It's the stalker! - It's the stalker! - It's the stalker! Get him, Ken! Shoot him, Ken. Shoot him! Ken, shoot him! Yes! That's what I'm talking about! I shot him dead! I shot him eight times! And I liked it! It was a rush, man. I have a head injury from being smacked in the head. Fairly concussed, I have to go to the hospital. After crossing into manhood and becoming a true warrior, Ken decided to quit. - Stop! I'm trying to catch up with him. -Go. -What? This is a talk show! -Sit down! -He's an enemy. "He's an enemy." Sit down. I'm gonna sit down because I wanna sit down. -Sit down! You been good? -Yeah, man. Yeah, I'm doing good too. All right. Tell someone who fucking cares. Fucking Harvey Dent over there. - Tell him over there. - Leave him alone. - You're a bully. - I-- Yeah. Yeah. Today we have Dom Mazzetti, an ex-fight manager and now gym owner. And this guy Jay who I saw at In-N-Out Burger about 25 minutes ago. I gave him $50 to come here and help me kick the shit out of Dom. -Nice-- Nicely done, dude. -Thanks, bro. -So, Dom, what have you been up to? -Other than most of your chicks? Ba-dum-tish, you got one of those? Like a laugh track? 'Cause everybody should be - fucking laughing 'cause you're a joke. - -Fuck you, dude! -Yo, you know what? Stacy told you to leave us alone. -Stacy? -Yeah, Stacy. -You're talking-- We're gonna talk about Stacy right now? -We're gonna talk about Stacy. -Okay, you bring me here to talk about Stacy? -Yeah! -She, she was my ex first. No, no, no, I don't think that was it. I dated her before you did, then you-- she, she cheated on me with you and then I--- She was my chick, dude. She's mine now. She's pregnant. You are the father! -She's pregnant? -Yup. I'm pregnant, baby! I'm having a motherfucking baby, baby. You're fucking pregnant? Goddamm-- -Oh, it's mine. -What? Reasonably certain it's 100% mine. I'm reasonably certain it's 100% mine. - When's the last time you had sex with her. When's the last time you had sex with her. -Like, three years ago? -That doesn't make any sense. Makes absolute sense. We banged, she's pregnant. I banged her into pregnancy. What do you mean? What do you mean it doesn't make sense? You tensing up, dude? - I'm just-- - You're looking like you're tensing up. -I'm looking right through you. -Oh, yeah? At what? -It's not as yellow in here as I thought it was. Weird. -Yeah, it's-- yeah, it's-- -it's a lot brighter too. I'm gonna put these back on. -Yeah. -Put them definitely back on. -So, Dom, have you ever studied martial arts before? Oh, studied them? Nah, I just do them. -I don't need to study. -Like which ones? -All of them. -You do all martial arts? -All of them. -Taekwondo? -Name one. -I just did. KO! So guy I met at In-N-Out Burger 15 minutes ago, what do you do? -Uh, well I-- -Okay, anyway. I'm sorry, how the fuck do you guys know each other? -Us two? -We got way back. - We lift together, dude. - How's everything? -It's good, you know? Yeah. -Same old stuff? Still got those night terrors -going on. -You remember that one time that dumbbell fell on my freaking head? Honestly, I felt pretty guilty -about it 'cause I, I let you down. -No, stop. I just-- I let it crush you on the head. Oh, you making a, making a shake for us? Yeah. Serve it up when you're done. That's probably enough. Yeah. - I'm good, I'm good, I'm good. -Thanks, dude. -Cool. Thank you. -This is for me. I didn't make enough for you guys. - That's cool. We just-- - Can I get a little bit? -Give me a little bit. Thanks. -Here. -Can you give me a little bit of that? -No, dude! Jesus Christ, give-- enough attention from you. What are you talking about, man? Why do you have this beef with me? You still owe, owe me all that money. We put on fights. You were the guy who throws them, okay? -You throw the fights, that's how it works. -You never paid me. -'Cause you lost. -That was the point of the deal, was, I was supposed to lose and then you were supposed to pay me for rigging the fight. -Okay, take it up with management. -You are my manager! - Okay, so take it up with me then! - -Holy shit. -Let's go! Take it up! -You wanna go? -Yeah, let's go! -Okay. Let's just talk about it. - Okay. - Because... Yeah, let's just talk, dude. - Okay. - Okay? You're here to talk about it. Gave the man some protein. I know when you give him protein what happens. - So how do you two know each other? Oh, yeah, we go back to, uh, to Bangkok. Bangkok, Thailand, 2019. The greatest fighters in the world assembled for a tournament. Dom managed SENSAI. SENSAI's only job, throw the fights so they could both get rich. When tournament rules changed to death-style combat, SENSAI refused to lose. 'Cause that meant if he threw the fight, he would fucking die. And Dom would take all the money. They haven't spoken until now. -I had a great time in Bangkok. -Yeah. I had a great time in Stacy too. I mean, she was good. You son of a fucking asshole! I was just joking around! Come on, it was like, you know, like a funny thing. Like, guys, like, friends, they joke like, "I banged your wife and I still do." -Ha, ha, it's so funny! -No, it was never funny. Honestly, I thought you were like a guy's guy, you know? Come on. - No, I'm super sensitive. - Okay, fine. I'm a hitman. I know all about forgiveness. Guys, forgiveness is very, very important because if you don't have that, you're never gonna have any bros. In this world, there's only a few bros that are gonna come around that are like us. You know what I'm saying? So look, if you two can't forgive each other, there's a lot of history there. Bangkok. Fights. Stacy. Uh, so, like, you know, you just gotta, you know what I'm saying? Like, forgive each other, love each other. Let's get back to doing our thing, you know? 'Cause now I'm part of the group. -Right? -That's a lot of knowledge, man. -Psst. -Bangkok was-- -Okay. -I'm glad, I'm glad you-- -Okay. -I'm glad you found love, man. So let's, let's find love. - Let's find love. You and me. - I came here for that. Okay? Let's hug it out. Let's hug it out. Come on. -I'm coming in, I'm coming in on the sides. -All right. - Oh, fucking. What's this? What is this? - What? What? Nothing. What do you got in you? What, you got some armor on? You come here with fucking armor on? Come on! You bit my ear, you fucking weasel! That's my fucking ear! I overreacted, I'm sorry! I, I overreacted. Yeah, yeah, so today's, uh, my last day working with SENSAI. Uh... There's just too much work to do. I honestly cannot believe how many people he's being sued by. I thought, I thought, I thought, I thought, - that it was a joke when he said... ...that he bit a guy's ear off on tape and put it in his TV show. And then the guy's suing him. I thought it was like a stunt or something, but he did. After biting off Dom Mazzetti's ear, SENSAI was facing some serious charges, but he had finally shown that asshole who's boss. Fearing for their average lives, the entire film crew quit. Well, that sucked. Don't think I wanna do this anymore. Being famous is not all that it's cracked up to be. Fucking leg hurts. Fuck, you have the keys? I got the keys. Coen didn't even do anything. He just sat there. It was uncalled for. It's uncalled for. I fucked up a lot. This was my one opportunity to pay Coen back. And to be a good father and a good husband. And to be famous again. And I f-- I just-- I fucking lost all the money again. So. I just... Oh, fuck. Holy fuck you're quiet, dude! Why-- You're always, like, lingering. Why are you so quiet? Cops showed up to arrest SENSAI, but he was nowhere to be found. He had mysteriously escaped. But he, uh... -What do you mean? -I mean we're ending at six episodes. We, we're done. Uh... No. No, no. 'Cause, uh... You know, it's, it's, it's seven that you're gonna shoot next and then it's, and then it's my episode. I, I get it, but we're, we, we're closing up. We're closing shop now. You know, I'm just exhausted. I mean I'm just absolutely exhausted. It's... It was exciting. It was, it was an exciting opportunity, I, uh... It was a little weird my DJ booth was never actually in the studio and I wasn't ever really recorded during my own segments. Which were promised contractually to me. He wanted the narrator from Roadhouse, but I, I told him that guy was, was, was dead. You know what's funny? I never met the guy. No. Uh, we met offline. But I love Beach Kumite. You know, that first episode? It changed my life. Yeah, I would say it was difficult working with him at times. Uh, main reason 'cause I never got paid.
