I can't believe tonight's the night. It's finally happening, Brit. You deserve this, Liv. Your art displayed at the Christmas Wonderland exhibit, this is huge. - Can you hold this? - Sure. My last piece of the collection. I've been dreaming about this my whole life. I'm so proud of you, Liv. You need help with that? Nope. I am good. You, uh, you sure about that? You're making it look real awkward. Nope, I'm good. It's not me. It's these clothes. How do you even function in these? You're the one who asked to borrow them. I did, didn't I? It's okay. I got this. I got my first art show. I got my best friend with me and a fresh cup of coffee. Today's gonna be the perfect sta to a perfect day to a perfect future. Absolutely. You okay? Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am, you have to throw away your coffee. Still gonna be perfect. Just a little less caffeine. You got this. Yeah. Merry Christmas. - Hey! - No, no, no. You, you got to stop living in the past, man. I'm not living in the past. I just don't want you to set me on another terrible blind date. Now, why do you automatically think it's gonna be terrible? Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice... - Third time's the charm. - Reggie, no. When was the last time you did something new for yourself? Hm? Look, you... you are way too young to be officially stuck in your ways. Tell that to my knees. And I am doing something new for myself tonight, as a matter of fact. Changing your pizza order does not count. - I'm going to the city. - Really? - A date? - No. - Santa Claus parade? - No. - That's all I got. - Art show. I'm going to support Mrs. Jenkins' friend. You're going to that? You're not? Of course not. It's an art show. - She's our boss. - No. She's not our boss. She's retired. See? Stuck in the past. You're stuck in the past. Let's go, guys, one more time. There. Perfect. You sure are. Bradley. Hi. Hey. For you. Oh, thank you. You got me my lucky beet smoothie. How did you smuggle this in? I had to surrender my coffee to the very intimidating security guard out there. He was wearing a Santa hat. To the mildly intimidating security guard out there. Well, I suppose being the son of a gallery owner has its perks. Um, how exactly is a beet smoothie lucky? Well, it means that I will be "unbeetable" tonight. Get it? 'Cuz of the beets. - Mm-hm. - Oh, I get it. - You're a good man, Bradley. - I try. If he did not laugh at my fruit jokes, I would have to let that "mango." A very good man. Oh, come on, you love my punnies. - I'm hilarious. - What you are is talented. I'll take that. So... what do you think? I think it's nice. Nice? Anything else? Well, I think it'll be a hit tonight. I heard the senator will be here and politicians always like nice art. Any celebrities coming? - Probably. - Sweet. Um, does it make you feel anything? Sure. Yeah. Well, what does it make you feel? Good. Yeah, it makes me feel good. Oh, sorry, Liv. I gotta go. So soon? Yeah, my father's counting on me to make tonight successful while he is out of the country. Enjoy your smoothie - and I'll see you tonight, okay. - Yeah. Brittany, take care of my special artist. You got it. It makes him feel... good. Okay. Okay, So your boyfriend doesn't have his father's knowledge of art, but he does laugh at your lame jokes and he did get you your lucky smoothie so points for that? How does it make you feel? Good. Really, really good. Like really. You know Christmas is still four weeks away, right? Yeah, well, Jake likes to suffocate me with holiday spirit. Yeah, how was hockey practice? - Fun. - Embarrassing. You can't compare yourself to Jake, Reggie. I mean professional athletes are in the league of their own. I've never been a professional athlete, Gramps. Yeah, well you could have been if it wasn't for that guy. That was a long time ago. Well, you're still tops in my book. Thanks, Gramps. Did you get your walk in today? Yes, sir. You lying? Reggie, will you, uh, tell my grandson to get off my case about that whole walking thing? I've been walking for 85 years. I've done more steps than both of you guys combined. Besides, it's freezing out there. I mean, he's got a point. It's really cold out... - Don't encourage him. - Sorry. Gramps, you got to get your steps in. I didn't buy you that expensive watch so you could tell the time. Doctor says, "use it or lose it." Happy to lose it. Hey, Reggie. - Yep? - You want an expense watch? - Sure. - Don't even think it. - So? - Oh. What do you think? - You look stunning. - Are you sure? This dress is so not me. But at least I can breathe in this one. Well, Cheesers approves. Aw, thanks, Cheesers. Well, hopefully, after this show I can stop borrowing your dresses - and buy a few of my own. - For the record, there's nothing wrong with your current wardrobe. There is if I wanna fit into this art crowd. Bradley's T-shirts are worth more than my rent. Hello. - Ah, Mary! - Come in. Come in. Hi. Oh, so nice to see you. Thank you so much for coming. I wouldn't miss it. Your first big art exhibit. I can't tell you how proud I am of you. Wait 'til you see the collection. Stunning. I couldn't have done it without you. You did this all on your own. I just cheered you on. Mary, if it wasn't for you, I would've never left my teaching job for an art career. It's not easy leaving a comfortable life behind to follow a dream, but you did. Yeah, I just hope it works out. Two years of art school and no full-time job really put a damper on my savings. I'm not exactly where I thought I would be at my age. You're where you're supposed to be. You know, I'm not exactly where I thought I'd be at this age, but like I always say, life is about the journey. - Not the destination. - Destination. We all need to take chances in life. Agreed. I'm taking a chance on this four-day old Thai food. Any takers? - I think we'll pass. - Okay, more for me. Liv, now that you've graduated, you can always come back and teach while doing art part time. Balancing both worked beautifully for me. And I happen to know that they're looking for someone to fill in for Mrs. Mattel until Christmas. I could pull some strings. Thanks, Mary. But hopefully, if tonight goes well, I can do my art full time. Oh, I hope people show up. I have a feeling you'll have your own little fan club tonight I might have invited a few colleagues. Oh. This evening will be perfect. Yeah. Oh. - Hello? - This evening's a disaster. - Bradley, what's wrong? - The caterer isn't here yet. People are gonna start arriving in under two hours and I don't have anything to serve them. It's okay. Just take a breath. I'm sure they're on their way. Traffic in the city right now is terrible. - They'll be there. - Yeah, well, they better be. Do you want me to come in early and help you figure things out? That would be great. Okay. On my way. I need to leave early. I'm just gonna grab a cab. You guys take your time and I will see you in a couple of hours. - Is everything okay? - Yeah. Yeah, I think Bradley's just a little nervous. Okay, dear, see you soon. Good luck. - Thank you. - See you in a bit. Bye, Cheesers. It's actually really good. Four days. - Ah, oh! - Ahh. I am so sorry. It's perfectly okay. Is that a beet smoothie? It is. - It was. - Oh, no. Did I get any on my dress? Uh, nope. I think my shirt took the "beeting." - You're safe. - You're funny. - Thanks. - Guess it is a lucky smoothie. Um, how do you figure? Oh, yeah, not for you. Definitely not for you, but for me because I didn't get any on my dress and it's a rental. I don't own this dress, so... - Yay. - Mm. Can I offer you anything for your dry cleaning? No, that's okay. I never really liked this shirt anyway. You actually did me a favor. Well, then I guess it was lucky for both of us. I guess it was. Thanks for being so kind about this. It's nice to meet somebody so "upbeet". - Good one. - Thanks. Look, I, I'm sorry to ruin your shirt and run, but I actually, I have to go. It was great meeting you. Yeah. You too. Huh. I need these hors d'oeuvres to be ready in an hour. Guests are gonna start arriving soon. Apologies, Mr. Johnson. We will be ready on time. Traffic was horrible. Traffic is always horrible in the city. You should have taken that into account. - Hi. - Hi. Security told me where I could find you. Are you okay? How did they not take traffic into account? Just breathe. They're here now. I'm here now. Tonight needs to be perfect. You're putting so much pressure on yourself. Just... give yourself some grace. You are doing amazing. You know, I'm nervous too. I have to take this. Could you go take a look at the gallery, make sure that everything looks perfect? - Yeah, of course. - Great. Hey, what do you think of my new... Dress... I'm sorry, You can't be in here yet. The show doesn't start for another hour. - Hi. - Hi. What are you doing here? Oh, um, security guard let me in early to change. I didn't exactly look my best with a beet smoothie spilled all over my shirt, so... It was lucky. - Nice jersey. - Thanks. I know it's not exactly appropriate attire for tonight's event, but it's all I had in my truck. Well, at least you picked a good team. It is my dad's favorite so I have a soft spot for the Blue Knights. You follow hockey? A little? Are you a big fan? I was. I-I mean, I am. I was recruited by the Knights back in the day... Dream come true. But, um, I got injured during training so I never really got a chance to play. This jersey is the closest I'll ever come to the big leagues. That's closer than most. I suppose. So you are a hockey player and an art connoisseur? Not really, no. I mean, I love art but I'm far from a connoisseur. Yeah, I came here tonight to support my boss. Ex-boss. But I was really drawn to this painting. - You were? - Yes. Yeah, it makes me feel like there's still possibilities in this world. I mean, I imagine all of the different people that have sat on this bench in the middle of this busy city. You know, older couples, first dates, tourists. All with their own unique dreams and hopes and possibilities. It's hopeful. I think you're more of an art connoisseur than you thought. Really? Well, what do you think the artist was trying to express when they painted this? I think I know a thing or two about what she was thinking and I would say that you had a very insightful guess. Wait... Did you paint this? What's going on? We need to evacuate. There's a fire in the kitchen. - But what about my paintings? - No time. Come on. Come on. Hey, we're all done in there. Liv? What happened? Caterers burnt the hors d'oeuvres. Lots of smoke. Why are you wet? Sprinkler system got me on the way out. Oh, honey, I am so sorry. It's ruined. All my hard work is gone. Things will work out, darling. This is just a temporary setback. What am I supposed to do? I put everything I had into this show. Mary's right, Liv. Everything's gonna work out. Oh, my gosh. Your dress. I ruined it. Liv, don't even worry about that. This night is a disaster. I lost everything. Not everything. Excuse me, miss. Is this yours? Yes. Thank you. Thank you so much for saving this. - It's my favorite piece. - It wasn't me, ma'am. A gentleman in a hockey jersey brought it down. Asked me to find the owner. Described a woman in a long green dress. Thank you. A man in a hockey jersey? Yeah. Well, who is he? I didn't catch his name. Come on, darling. Let's get you home. Thank you. So, a stranger in a hockey jersey saves your painting and disappears. Yeah. And when he was talking about my painting, it was like he was reading my soul. Well, that's intense. No, it's... It's not like that. I just meant he really got it, you know? It was... It was nice. And you ran into him twice today. Mm-hm. Okay, if I believed in fate which I don't, but if I did, I kind of feel like this isn't the last time you're gonna bump into this mystery man. Yeah, it was weird. Have you talked to Bradley? No. I left him a message, but he was pretty upset about tonight. - Meant a lot to him. - Liv... This night meant a lot to you too. He's your boyfriend. He should have called to make sure you're okay. I'm okay. So what are you gonna do? I don't know. You hiring? That all depends. Did you happen to go back to law school and graduate? - I did not. - Then we are not. Mm. What about what Mary said? Go back and teach. It's a short contract. You could do it until Christmas just to get back on your feet. Why does it feel like I'm giving up on my dreams? You are not giving up on your dreams. You're just doing what you need to do to succeed. Look, Liv, nothing ever works out the way we plan. You just have to keep your head up and keep plugging away. Plus you love working with kids. Maybe this is the perfect way to spend the holiday season just to get your mind off of things and so you're not crying on my couch. It's a good couch. It's a good couch. Just think about it, okay? Okay. - Love you. - Love you. Oh, Mary left this card for you. It's from some of her work colleagues. I guess she invited the entire staff to come to your show tonight. They seem like a pretty good bunch of people to work with. Think about it. Goodnight. Goodnight. I can do this. Today's gonna be the perfect start to a perfect day, to a perfect holiday season. Ah! Oh! I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to... It's okay. Can I sit? Are you gonna make me go back in there. Eventually but not right this minute. I'm Ms. James. I'm new here. - What's your name? - Trisha. It's nice to meet you, Trisha. I'm new here too. Oh, I see. I want to go home. Where is home? Chicago. When did you move here? Last week. It's my first day. Do you think that maybe it's a little early to make that decision? I mean, it's your first day and school hasn't started yet. Some girls on the bus were making fun of me. Then... everyone laughed. Sorry to hear that. The worst part is is that these girls are in my class. When Principal Rainer brought me to meet my new teacher, Mr. Hartley, my assigned desk was right next to them. This day could not get any worse. Well, if it can't get any worse, you know what that means? What? It can only get better. Look, I know we're not in the exact same position, but I do understand how difficul it is to start somewhere new. It takes a lot of courage. What if I don't have any? We all have courage inside of us. We just need to look. I'm scared too. You are? Absolutely. It's my first day too. I don't wanna go in there any more than you do. - Really? - Really. But, I also happen to know that once I do, I'll be glad I did. And in a couple weeks from now, we'll both have new friends and we'll fit right in. What are we gonna do about those girls in the meantime? Why don't we go in together and I will talk to Mr. Hartley for you. - Really? - What do you say? - Deal? - Deal. Oh, and I'm really sorry about your shirt. Mm. It's okay. Maybe no one will notice. Olivia, welcome. Welcome. We are so happy to have you here. Mary has said so many wonderful things about you. Well, I'm very happy to be here. Oh, is this for me? - This? - Yeah. Oh. Yeah, yeah, of course. - Oh-ho. - Yeah, it's for you. Well, oops. Looks like your day's off to a wonderful start already. It certainly appears that way, doesn't it? - Speaking of which... - Mm-hm. I happened to bump into one of your students today Wondering if you could introduce me to Mr. Hartley. I'd like to discuss something with him. Principal Rainer? Ah, sorry to interrupt, but... Hi. Hi. Uh... Oh, well, it seems no introductions are necessary here after all. Mr. Hartley, Ms. James has something she wanted to discuss with you. Perhaps you could, um, show her around? - Happy to. - Great. - I'm Jake, by the way. - Liv. It's nice to officially meet you. Although, I have to say this is another strange coincidence. You know what they say: third time's a charm. Well, first time we met my shirt was "beeten." The second time we burned down an art gallery. Can't wait to see what life has in store for us today. When you put it that way, I'm slightly terrified. Although I did spill coffee on myself this morning. Does that count? First day is always such a grind. Oh. Good one. But, since it happened before I saw you, you might have to take extra precautions. I am definitely sensing some end of the world vibes. On a more serious note... More serious than human annihilation? Yes. I have a favor to ask. How can I help? I happened to bump into one of your students this morning. - Trisha. - Our new student. She seems to be having a hard time this morning. She is. Any chance you can reconsider her seating arrangement? She's getting teased by a couple girls and it would be easier on her if she wasn't sitting right next to them. Hm. I suppose I could consider it since the world will probably end before noon anyway. Perfect. Oh, I have one more favor to ask. No good deed... You don't happen to have that jersey in your truck still, do you? Remember with art, complementary colours are very important. Uh, remember to finish your color wheels tonight and I will see you all tomorrow. Bye. - Hi, Liv. - Bradley. Hi. How's your day? Uh, not terrible. Yours? Not terrible. I forgot how hard it is to entertain kids all day. It was exhausting, but... good. Well, lucky for you it's temporary. Yeah, how did it go with the gallery? - Any word on the damage? - Actually, yes. Um, it turns out it isn't as bad as we originally thought. We may need to redo the floors but, um, we should be up and running before Christmas. - That's great. - It is. Hey, um, what are you doing Friday night? Nothing. Why? Well, my father's coming back to town and I'd really love it if you'd join us for dinner. Are you sure? I mean, aren't you guys gonna be busy with the gallery? Yes, but having one of his chosen artists join us might help soften the blow of this disaster. If you think so, then of course I will be there. I owe your dad a lot. If it wasn't for him choosing my art to be in his show, I would've never met you. Well, we both owe him for that. Okay, I gotta run but we'll talk later? Sure thing. - We made it. - We did. No apocalypse. The sun is still shining. I guess it's been a pretty good day. How was your first day? Honestly, a lot harder than I remember. - It'll get easier. - Yeah, I'm sure it will. Oh, how did it go with Trisha? I put her in a nice quiet place far away from those girls. - Thank you. - She'll be okay. She just needs some time to adapt. There's some good kids in that class. - She'll make friends quickly. - I hope so. I know what it's like to be the new kid in school. And look how quickly you made a friend. On that note, thank you for lending me the jersey. It was a big hit. My pleasure. Unfortunately, it came with a price. I'm afraid you're out of luck, buddy. I am completely broke until my first paycheck. Not that kind of price. Come on. It'll be fun. Yeah, hi. Hey, there's our star player and you brought a friend. Yeah, Reggie meet Liv. Liv, this is Reggie History, room 209, meet art, room 102. Oh, you're taking over from Mrs. Mattel 'til Christmas. Yeah. And, apparently, her spot on this team. - Wonderful. Uh, can you play? - I can skate. Well, that's 50% of the battle right there. Yeah, it's the other 50% that I'm concerned with. I do not have that figured out myself. Good, then there's no pressure. So what brings you to our humble little abode? It's a long story. Got an abbreviated version? That's our Reggie. Always looking for a shortcut. Time is precious, my friend. I'd love to hear the long version sometime if you'd be willing to share. I'd like that. Okay, well I'm gonna go take some laps 'cause I definitely need the practice. Okay, let's rock and roll. Oh, hey, thanks for doing this. I realize it's probably outside your comfort zone. Well, you know, life's about the journey, Not the destination. - Mary. - Mrs. Jenkins. You still call Mary Mrs. Jenkins? I guess I do. All right, try to keep up. Oh, I'll be all right. Whoo! - Yeah! - Whoo! Did you see her out there? That girl's a keeper. She sure is. Well, I mean for our team. Obviously, she's a keeper for our team. Uh-huh. Hey. That's a lot of fun. Thank you for lending me your jersey. How can I repay you for making my first day great? I made your first day great? Yeah, you did. Any chance that you want to help me out with the Christmas concert? Uh, I was put in charge of it when Mrs. Mattel went on leave. Auditions are tomorrow. Oh, wow, that sounds like a lot of fun but I was thinking of a shorter commitment. Something like bringing you coffee in the morning. Oh, I'll take the coffee in the morning. I believe she was talking to me. I was talking to him. I do like coffee, though. Should I bring an extra jersey just in case? Better safe than sorry. Is that a no on the coffee? Is there any way I can convince you to give me all of your extra time to help me out with this talent show? I would love to but... I need to paint. Bummer. How about you, Reg? Oh, hi. I'm back in the conversation? Thanks, that's great. No, unfortunately, I have to paint too. It's a fresh coat in the living room that I'd much rather do. And I thought you two were my friends. I will see you both tomorrow. - And Reggie? - Yeah? That is a yes on the coffee for you too. Definitely a keeper. Not tonight. - Hi, Reggie. - Hi. One cream, two sugar, right? Sweet Christmas. You're a mind reader. That is impressive. Yeah, well, I texted Jake this morning so... - Ah, that makes more sense. - Mm. Less impressive but, still, thank you. Oh, um, can you actually give this to Jake for me? - Yeah, no problemo. - Thanks. - Hi. - Hi. Can I join? So, I heard that Mr. Hartley gave you a new seating arrangement. He did. Thanks for that. No problem. Are you okay? When will it get easier? Uh, it's gonna take some time, but I promise you it will. I miss my old school. What do you miss most about it? My friends. Anything else? I don't know. Music class, I guess. I was taking singing lessons back home and I loved it. It was more of an artistic school. Everything here feels so structured, so plain. Well, maybe, we just need to bring a little of ourselves to this place. How are we gonna do that? Hmm... I have some ideas. Good morning, everyone. Who wants to do art class outside today? Great. Grab some supplies and follow me. Good. Very good. Looking good there. Ah, this is beautiful. Hm. Okay, close your books. Pop quiz. Ms. James, how's this look? It looks beautiful, Heath. Ah. Mary. I see you're bringing a little holiday spirit to the school. Hi. Mm. What are you doing here? You know, retirement means that you don't have to work anymore. I know. Who knew I'd miss this place already? I volunteered to help out at the Christmas concert. Mr. Hartley needed a hand. Oh, yeah. You know, I was thinking about doing that too. And, fun fact, Jake is the mystery man who saved my painting the night of the art show. Really? Small world. Yeah. Small world. He's a sweet man. Takes care of his grandfather and does a lot of work for the community. I can tell he's got a good heart. So, any word on the gallery? Well, Bradley seems to think it'll be up and running - before Christmas. - That's fast. Can you come up with a new collection in less than four weeks? I hope so. To be honest, I've been having a really hard time being inspired since I lost my pieces. I am creatively stuck. Well, you know what I always say, whenever you get stuck... Paint the places and the faces that you love. All right. Excellent work today. I will see you all tomorrow. Thank you for your effort. It's truly appreciated. So, what do you think? I think Ms. James brightened this place up. She sure did. - Hey. - Hey. We were just admiring your work. It's beautiful, Ms. James. Thanks, Trisha. I have you to thank for it. - Now, you ready for your part? - My part? Yeah, I brought a little of myself to this place, now it's time that you bring a little of yourself. Mr. Hartley, do you still need help - with that Christmas concert? - I sure do. Great. Then I'm gonna volunteer and Trisha here is going to audition. - She's gonna sing. - I am? It's your turn to brighten this place up. Come on. Thank you, Bobby. That was wonderful. Next up, we have Trisha. Looks like you really got through to her. I'm trying. And you're sure she can sing, right? No idea. We have some very talented kids. Yeah, we do. You are really good with them. Thanks. Was teaching always your second passion after hockey? I guess it was, although I didn't know it. Yeah, after my injury, I spent a lot of time and money on physical therapy. I ended up going broke. Feeling pretty hopeless. I needed somewhere to go so I moved in with my grandfather. Mary told me that you take care of him now. Uh, I'm just repaying the favor. Yeah, he put my life back on track after my hockey career fell apart. All I knew was hockey. He taught me that, uh... life moves on after huge disappointments and you have a choice. You can either wallow in that self-pity or you can move forward. And how did you figure out that teaching was your path forward? - Summer holidays. - Ooh, solid reason. Just kidding. No, I ended up coaching the hockey team and I realized the impact that I could make on these young people's lives. So, I went back to school and got my teaching degree. How about you? Do I finally get to hear the long version now? Well, I guess it's not that long, but I always loved to paint, you know? And my grandmother, Henrietta, she was an artist. And every year on my birthday, we would go through her closet and find the most beautiful dresses. We would find these extravagant costumes and go from art gallery to art gallery in the city. Some years I would be a princess and other years I'd dress up as an actress from a movie I loved. She was the one that made me fall in love with art. I loved those birthdays. Henrietta sounds like an amazing woman. I always wanted to just follow in her footsteps, but my parents were a lot more practical. So you went into teaching. Taught for ten years. Loved it but I left my dreams of being an artist aside until one weekend, I went to a teacher's conference and met Mary. Mrs. Jenkins. She was absolutely inspiring. You know, she was both a teacher and an artist. And the following weekend I went to go see her art and she had that same spark that my grandmother had. - Vibrant, you know? - Hm. And she convinced me to go back to art school and follow my dreams. Dreams are important. And you seem like you're getting there. I thought I was, but I'm not so sure anymore. Because of what happened at the art exhibit? Kind of took the wind outta my sails. I am feeling a little lost. I'm not sure which direction to go in. Well, lucky for you, these kids tend to help give us purpose. Maybe you're exactly where you need to be. Maybe. For what it's worth, I'm really glad that you're here. Me too. Surprise. I hope you don't mind. Your concierge let me in. Bradley, hi. Not at all. This is beautiful. Yeah, it might be a bit cold. I thought you'd be home earlier. Yeah, I volunteered to help with the Christmas concert. They needed an extra hand. Do you have time for that? I'll find time. It'll be fun. How was your day? It was good. We should have some news about the new gallery dates soon. Oh, that's great. Hey, thank you so much for checking up on me. I could really use the company and this is so sweet. Of course. Why is there only one plate? Dinner for one. I can't stay. I just wanted to come by and say hi and make sure that you're still good for tomorrow. - Tomorrow? - Yes. Dinner with my father, remember? Right, yes. I will be there. Great. I'm sure that he'll want to hear about any of your new pieces. My new pieces. Right. You know how big of a fan he is of yours, hm? Yeah, your dad's been amazing. Hey, Bradley... is there any chance you could stay? We haven't really talked lately and, to be honest, I've been having a hard time with the new paintings. I'm so sorry, Liv, I can't. I've got so much work. But we'll hang out tomorrow, - I promise. Okay? - Okay. Enjoy the escargot. So, this girl is pretty, smart and she's got a wicked slap shot. Hm. What are you waiting for? Well, I just met her, Gramps. Mm-hm. When I met your grandmother I asked her out the first time I had laid eyes on her. - I know. - Mm-hm. Things are more complicated now. Hm. I think you kids make them more complicated. Actually, they're very simple. No, they are more complicated. What if she has a boyfriend? Did you ask her? - No. - Well, it's simple, really. You say, "Have you got a boyfriend?" Checkmate. How did you do that? You just have to have the right moves, boy. Also, your mind was preoccupied. I'm not sure how to do this. You are doing great. I'm so awkward. I'm sorry. It's okay. Just... Breathe. And try to sit still. Why am I doing this, exactly? Because you are a good guy and you got into a bad habit of doing me big favors. I'll have to work on that. Yeah, I drew that same conclusion. - Ha-ha. - Honestly... I've just been having a hard time getting inspired lately. You know, and Mary always says, when you get creatively blocked to paint the places and faces you love, so... There's the smile I was looking for. Whatever you're thinking of right now, just... - keep thinking that. - You got it. Hey, Jake, did you catch the score... Hi. You know, if you need a real model, I'd be happy to oblige. I mean, I'm much better looking than this ugly mug. - Hey! - Thanks, Reggie, but... yeah, I-I kind of like his ugly mug. - I'm not sure how to take this. - Oh, okay, fine, your loss. Hey, are you two up for the annual Christmas karaoke night? Christmas karaoke? Yearly tradition, tonight, eight o'clock at the Flame. It's where I really get to shine. You definitely don't wanna miss that. What do you say, Liv? Um, I would love to, but I have plans tonight. Big date? Yeah. Actually I am going to dinner with my boyfriend and his father. - Rain check. - Yeah, sure thing. Yeah. Uh, you are definitely gonna be there, though. - I will. - Yes. Lord help us. Your loss. Yeah. Early birthday present. Mary. Aw, thank you. You shouldn't have. Oh, it's just a little something. You're too sweet. - When's your birthday? - It's Monday. I'll have to remember that. Liv, this mural is looking beautiful. Looks like you'll have an art exhibit this Christmas regardless of what happens with the gallery. I guess you're right. Well, enjoy your weekend. Looks like you two have everything flowing nicely here. You have a good weekend too, Mrs. Jenkins. Goodbye, Mary. Thank you. Is that seat taken? Uh... No. Listen, I heard what those kids said earlier. Don't worry about them. Do you want to practice with me today? - Sure. - Cool. Great voice by the way. You can really sing. Thanks. Looks like we do have things flowing nicely. See? Just took a little time. It's really nice to see her making friends. I, um, I should actually get going too. Oh, right. You have a date. Yeah. Well, have fun on your... date. - Thanks. - Oh, and Liv, thank you so much for helping out with this. The kids really appreciate it. And I appreciate it too. Can you, um, finish the stars? Oh, yep. Thanks. Just, uh, I'll get the star. Goodnight, Jake. Goodnight. Hey. - Can I borrow this dress? - Yes, of course. But you do know you own plenty of nice dresses, right? I told you, they're not good enough. - Not for this crowd. - Liv, "this crowd" is your boyfriend and his father. You don't need to change your style to impress them. I know, but... can I borrow it anyway? And these killer heels. Can you even walk in those? Well, there's a first time for everything. Liv, you've been with Bradley for six months now. Don't you think it's time you stop trying to be someone you're not and let your true self shine through? I mean, does Bradley even know the real you? Bradley and his dad took a huge risk on me. I just... I don't wanna let them down. Objection, speculation. Okay, Miss Lawyer, what do you think? I think they saw talent and support it. And I don't think you need to try to be someone you're not. Honestly, Liv... I am sorry to say but I just don't see a spark in your eyes when you look at Bradley. - Not even a little? - No. Yeah, I just, every time I try to be myself around him or speak to him, things get... busy. Well, things have been busy since you started dating him. I'm just saying, I don't think you need a fancy dress to impress him. Just be you. Fine. I will be me. Great. Starting tomorrow. Okay, but I'm warning you, good luck with those heels. Right? - So, a fresh coat of paint... - Thank you. And just the floors... The floors are just about finished. Great. Hi. There she is. - Oh! - Are you okay? Yeah, just um, huh, new shoes. - Well, you look stunning. - Thank you. Lovely as always, Olivia. - Thank you. - We ordered. I hope you don't mind. No, not at all. The food here is delectable and we are celebrating. - We are? - Yes. Fortunately, the bind my son put us in is not as terrible as we originally thought. It was the caterer's, Father. I don't really feel like it was my fault. You booked the caterer, Son. You have to take responsibility for your choices. As I was saying, it appears that your art exhibit is back on in three weeks. - Three weeks? - Mm-hm. Wow, that's great. What day? December 23rd. Two days before Christmas. Isn't that wonderful? It'll be the biggest event in the city this holiday. That's fantastic. Oh, um, that's the same day as the school Christmas concert. Well, lucky for you, you can quit your teaching job and you don't have to worry about the concert. I can't quit. I need my job to pay the bills. Not anymore. The insurance company sent checks. This is yours. It's to cover the art you lost in the fire. Are you serious? This is a lot of money. It replaces the, uh, pieces that were damaged at a fair market value. Fair market value. Right. That should be enough money for you to quit your job and focus on those new pieces. Thank you. And I promise I will focus on the new pieces, but Bradley, I told you, I can't quit. Those kids are counting on me. They're 12-year-old children, Liv. Anyone can help them with their Christmas show. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. I don't know what to say. Well, you don't have to say anything. You just have to make sure that your new collection is as spectacular as your last. Excuse me. I have to take this. Aren't you excited? Absolutely. And a little overwhelmed. Bradley, I was trying to tell you yesterday I'm having a really hard time with my new paintings. Well, it's probably just 'cause you're tired from teaching. - I don't think that's it. - Sure it is. Quit on Monday and you'll be fine. Bradley, I told you I can't quit. These kids are important to me and Mary pulled a lot of strings to get me this job. You'll figure it out. Speaking of Monday, I have planned a romantic night for us for your birthday at the best restaurant in town. Bradley... We need to talk. We are talking. I mean privately. After dinner. Apologies, uh, but I'm gonna have to leave. I've got an important meeting that, uh, just came up and I have to leave right away. Of course. I completely understand. - Bradley, you coming? - Uh, yes, Father. I'll, I'll meet you in the car in a couple minutes. - Good night, Olivia. - Goodnight, Mr. Johnson. You're leaving? Again? I thought we were gonna have dinner together. Well, you can get a to-go box. My father needs me. Bradley, I need... I don't think that this... is working. Can we talk about this later? There's a lot going on right now. There is. And you've been so tied up in your father's world and I've been focused on school... This is a very busy time at the gallery, Liv. It is. And I appreciate all the hard work you've been doing and the passion you have for making your father proud but, Bradley, you and I... It's over. I'm sorry. So, you guys broke up. For real? - For real. - You okay? Yeah. I'll be fine. You wanna drown your sorrows in some of this yummy food you brought back? It's delicious. I don't even recognize anything in those containers. Is it chicken, beef, octopus? - Nobody knows. - It's definitely octopus. Gross. Everything will work out. You know what I think? I think you need to take this weekend and just let everything go. Let's have some fun. Let's go out tonight. Well... I am all dressed up. Anywhere you wanna go. Hm... - Anywhere. - Name it. How does Christmas karaoke sound? Thank you. Thanks. I, um, think we might be slightly overdressed. Yeah, I was not privy to dress code. Who's that? That's Reggie. He's a good guy. And a great singer. Yeah, I guess he is. - Yeah. - Whoo! I mean, I nailed that. So, T-shirt by day and rock star by night, huh, Reg. What can I say? I'm a man of many talents. - I'm so happy you came. - Me too. - Me three. - Hi. Hi. - Hi. - Hi. - That's a great dress. - Thank you. Oh, guys, this is my best friend, Brit. Brit, this is Reggie and Jake. Uh, finally I get to meet the Mystery Man. Thank you. Thank you. I mean, some do say I have this dark brooding quality about me. I like to think of it as a sparkly vampire kind of a thing. Wow. Funny and talented. - I never get handsome. - Right. And humble. I mean, I almost forgot that. Oh. Can I offer you some punch? Maybe a mediocre appetizer. Wow, you had me at mediocre appetizer. - Yeah? - Mm-hm. Spectacular. - Yeah. - What about a warm beer? - I'm not a big beer drinker. - No? What would you like? A daiquiri, margarita, mojito? So, uh, wh... What happened to your plans with your boyfriend? Plans changed. Oh. Well, it's great to see you. You too. Is it just me or am I sensing a bit of a love connection happening with those two. Oh, you sense that too, huh? Mm-hm. Who knew we were such great matchmakers? Yeah, I would've never guessed that those two would... So, what happened with the big date? My big date? Yeah. It just, um, it just didn't work out. You know, he had to take care of something and I was there alone with the-the food and... We broke up. Oh! I'm sorry to hear that. Yeah. Thanks. Can I get you a drink? Please. On it. Cheers. - There you are. - Thank you. You're welcome. So, what about you? - What about me? - Well... my love life is in shambles. Tell me a little bit about yours. Anyone special in your life? Does Reggie count? No, I was thinking more of the romantic variety. In that case, no. Why not? Age-old story. Uh, girl broke my heart. Slow to get over it. How long? Four years. Wow, that's turtle pace. Mm-hm. She must have really hurt you. She did. And then Gramps got sick so I was really focused on that. I tried to patch things up, but she moved on at supersonic speed. She left me for an entrepreneur who sells wrinkle-free men's shirts. They got married, blah, blah, blah. You gotta watch out for those entrepreneurs. They are great salesmen. You're telling me. I bought five shirts from that guy? - You did not. - I did too. - Ah! - I hate ironing. Well, I hope you donated them after she left. No, but my very last one did recently get destroyed by a beet smoothie, so... That was the shirt. It was. Well, it was a sign. It's time to move on. Yeah. Time to move on. Hi, everyone. You all know me. I'm Reggie and I just wanted to introduce my new friend... Hi, I'm Brit. And we are gonna sing a very special duet for you. Hit it. Oh, well, that is something that I did not expect to see tonight. They look like they make a great team. Yeah, it does. Can I have this dance? Uh... Can we even dance to this? You can dance to anything... if you have the right partner. Okay. Hi. Hi. Liv. Oh! Excuse me. Ms. James. Mr. Hartley. - Hi. - Happy birthday. You remembered. Of course. How was the rest of your weekend? Good. Good, yeah, it was... It was great actually. I painted all day and all night. You did? That's fantastic. Yeah. I guess I suddenly felt inspired. I'm really happy to hear that. Hey, you two! Reggie, hi. Liv, by any chance, did Brit happen to say anything about me? Not that I'm prying. I just, I'd just really like to know if-if-if she said anything about me at all. Um, I mean, if she didn't, that's fine too. I just, I just, I, you know, I mean. Did she? She said you were a great singer. She did? Huh. That's something. - It ain't nothing. - Right? Oh, I gotta get back to class. Yep. Yeah, I should... I should get back to class. Yeah, me too. Oh, and, um, one other thing, for the record, um, I tend to overdo birthdays. It's a thing. So... don't think anything about anything should anything happen to happen today. In regards to birthdays, that is. - Okay. - Okay. - Oh, okay. - Okay. I'm gonna... You do that. This is a terrible idea. This is awesome. Why do I have to be a knight? It's the only costume in your size. Plus you match Ms. James. I guess it's too late to back out now. Why would you? I mean, Ms. James will love it. It's a special thank you for everything that she's done for us. Plus, this was your idea. I know. You guys are absolutely right. And you look great. Almost as good as me. Thanks, Bobby. Trisha, you ready? - Sure am. - Initiate phase two. Hi, Ms. James. You are cordially invited to join us in the theater in ten minutes. What are you guys up to? It's a dress. You have to wear it. What kind of dress? Mr. Hartley! - She's on her way. - Okay, great. Everybody in positions. Surprise. We heard that your grandma used to bring you to fancy art galleries for your birthday every year. And you got dressed up in beautiful costumes. So, we got all dressed up and... this is our fancy gallery. I don't know what to say. You guys are all too sweet. Well, it was Mr. Hartley's idea but we did most of the work. Thank you. This is spectacular. Oh, and look at those paintings. It's some of the most beautiful art I've ever seen. And we got cake. Mm. This was delicious. Not too bad, huh? Did you make this? I wish I could take credit for it. It was all Gramps. Is he the one that made this outfit? No, this was in my closet. Yeah, I moonlight as a knight in shining armor, so... Of course you do. - Hey, Jake. - Yeah. Thank you. My pleasure. I, uh... I just wanted to see if I could make you smile. You did. Oh, and um, I have a gift for you and I... forgot it in the classroom, so I'll sneak out and, um, bring it right back. Oh, you shouldn't have. You've already done way too much. I told you. I go overboard with birthdays. Ms. James. Mr. Hartley. Come on, we'll give you a full tour of the gallery. You guys go ahead. I will just grab something from the classroom... Uh, could I help you? Yes, Principal Rainer let me in. Told me I could find Liv James in room 102, but I seemed to have gotten a little turned around. Um, I'm Bradley Johnson. Uh, Jake Hartley. Nice outfit. Who you supposed to be, the tin man? A knight. You don't find many of those around anymore. No, I suppose not. So, do you know where I can find my girlfriend? Your girlfriend? Yeah. Yeah, it's her birthday. Big night out. Yeah, the limo's outside waiting and I don't wanna be late for our reservation. Yeah, uh, her class is room 102. It's downstairs to the left. I can go get her for you. Yeah, appreciate that. And good luck on your quest. Thanks. You too. Thanks. Hey! - Did she know about this? - Of course. I've been planning it for weeks. I can't believe you guys did this. It's so nice. Hey. - Is everything okay? - Yeah. It's just... your boyfriend's here to see you. - My boyfriend? - Bradley Johnson. Oh, um... He's waiting in your classroom. Jake, it's not what it looks like. He's just... You should go to him. I, I can clean up. Here is your birthday gift. You can open it later. It's not a big deal. It's just a little something. Jake, I can explain. You don't need to explain. It's okay. You should go. Right. I'll tell the kids that you say goodbye. Okay. Bradley. What are you doing here? Happy birthday. Here, these are for you. Bradley, we broke up. We said we would talk on Monday. It's Monday. You said we would talk about it on Monday. I said it was over. Liv, look, I'm sorry I've been so preoccupied. Let's start over, okay? Look, I want this night to be perfect for you. I've planned everything. The limo, the best restaurant in the city. - A Broadway show. - Bradley... I appreciate what you're doing, but... it's not where I want to spend my birthday. Where do you wanna spend it? Here. You, you'd rather stay here playing dress-up than a night on the town? Bradley... The truth is that I've been playing dress-up for the last six months with you. What are you talking about, Liv? The limos and the fancy restaurants and the dresses That's, that's not me. Where is this coming from? I owe you an apology. I haven't been my real self around you. I've been so caught up in trying to fit into your world that I haven't shown you my true self. Sure you have. No, I haven't. Those dresses are borrowed and I prefer pizza to escargot and my wardrobe consists of jeans and T-shirts. And princess dresses. On occasion. Bradley, love should inspire. It should inspire us to do amazing things. It should inspire us to believe that anything is possible. And if you look inside yourself, I think you'll realize that we haven't really been connecting. Or... inspiring each other. And maybe it's because we're both so caught up in work or maybe we're just, um, on different paths. I don't know. But I do know that your mind has been somewhere else and... And so has mine. And that's not fair to either one of us. I thought we had something really good starting here. We did. You are an incredible man, we're just... not the right fit. And this isn't the right time for either one of us. I'm sorry to hear that. But... I suppose if I'm being honest with myself, you might be right. We stay friends? I think it'd be very hard not to be. I, um... I hope this doesn't affect our ability to work together on the art exhibit. Liv, my father fell in love with your art before I fell in love with you. Nothing will affect our ability to work together. Thank you. Happy birthday, Liv. And I like that dress. I hope you find your knight in shining armor one day. Thank you. For the gift. It was... extremely thoughtful of you. Well, now you have one of your own. You can keep it in your trunk just in case. I love it. I'm glad. Jake, I owe you an apology. It's not what it looked like. Bradley and I are not together anymore. It's just... complicated. You don't owe me an explanation. Uh, your personal life is none of my business. And I-I know what all this looks like, but honestly, it was just a friend doing something nice for a friend for her birthday. I told you I go overboard with birthdays. Yeah. Yeah, of course. I-I didn't mean to say that this was anything more than that I just meant to say that... I know. It's complicated. Friends? Friends. Good afternoon, everyone. Before the bell rings, I just wanted to say Merry Christmas to all of our students and staff members. We hope to see everyone at tomorrow's Christmas concert. Have a safe and happy holiday. Merry Christmas, everyone. Have a happy holiday. Aww. Merry Christmas. Come in. Hi, Ms. James. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, Trisha. I bought you a little something as a thank you. For me? Do you like it? I love it. And it even has a lid so that you can't spill your coffee anymore. It's perfect. Thank you. I'm gonna really miss you, Ms. James. I'm gonna miss you too. Hey, are you okay? I'm just really nervous about tomorrow. You practiced so hard. You have nothing to worry about. Just... be yourself. I wish you could be there tomorrow. I would feel much better if you were. I wish I could be there too. But you will have all your new friends around you. I know and... I have to thank you for that. Thank you for helping me fit in here. You did that all on your own. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Hello. - Brit. Thank goodness you're here. I need your help. I have no idea what to wear. None of these are gonna work and... what is that? A gift. Ah... - It's beautiful. - It is. I thought you wanted me to work on being me. This dress... Huh. It's definitely not me. I just didn't want you hiding. And you're not hiding anymore. These dresses are also you, Liv. It's all you. I don't understand. You were afraid to show Bradley parts of you. You were only showing him pieces. You were hiding underneath a sliver of who you really were. But now you're shining. The full you is shining. The you in jeans, T-shirts, jerseys... And beautiful expensive dresses. The full you. I don't know what to say. Just go out there and shine tonight. Do what you love. - I love you, Brit. - I love you too. Oh. Aw, you made it. She's going to be so happy. Wow. I didn't know you were gonna be here tonight. And look how dapper you look. - I'm impressed. - Thank you. Who knew you could clean up so well. - What? - Looking sharp, Reggie. Thank you. I actually have a date tonight. And you left her in the car? What? No. I... No. I'm not dressed for this. Sorry, bud. Um... I'm meeting up with Brit. We're going to the gallery show tonight. - You are? - Yeah. That's wonderful. Tell her I wish I could be there. - I will. - I told this one he should be there too. - Mm? - Gramps, I... I can't leave. I'm in charge of this event. Ah, the kids will be fine. No, Gramps, they actually need adult supervision. Hah, we didn't need adult supervision when I was a kid. Well, whatever the case may have been, I think we should, we should get inside. Mary, will you, uh, help me get some extra steps in? I'd love to. So, did you come by to wish me luck? Uh, no. Yes, of course. But Liv wanted me to give you this. It's a Christmas present. - Okay. - Yeah. Thanks. Well, break a leg. Enjoy. - Thanks again. - Yeah. I am so nervous. It's gonna be great. I'm so proud of you. Wow. You look beautiful. Hey, you look pretty good yourself. Oh, I try. - Hi, Reggie. - Hi. It's packed out there. It's gonna be a heck of a night. - You excited? - Yes, I am. How is Jake? He's good. He's good. I gave him your gift. Thanks. I wish I could be there for the kids tonight. Listen, you made a heck of a teacher. Honestly, I loved being back. I think Mary had it right by doing both. Maybe you should consider staying on. Mm-hm. Maybe I should. I mean, teaching and art are both part of who I am. Well, I definitely know a teacher who'd be happy to have you back. Dear Jake. Merry Christmas. This one's for you. Thanks for the inspiration. I couldn't have done this art show without you. Good luck tonight. Did you open the gift? I sure did. I guess she listened to me. I'm sorry? Her creative block. She got over it by painting the people she loved. Yes, it is my first art exhibition and I am so happy that you're enjoying my pieces. Oh, um, excuse me. Um, you were saying? Can you tell us a bit about your background? I was a teacher. I ama teacher. Uh, and I've always loved art so I pursued my dream, went back to school and got my degree. And what inspired your latest pieces? They were inspired by the places and the faces that I love. I'm sorry. Please excuse me but I need to leave. Liv, Liv, where are you going? I have to leave. It's important. What could possibly be more important than a room full of critics? A room full of kids counting on me. Okay. I'll cover for you here. Go be there for the kids. Thank you, Bradley. And Merry Christmas. You pulled off a great show. Thanks, Liv. Merry Christmas. Hey, everything okay? Yeah. Hey, what do you guys think about getting outta here and going to see a Christmas concert? - I'm game. - I thought you'd never ask. Let's go! Oh. Um, I'll meet you guys inside, okay? - Okay. - Thank you. Ms. James? What are you doing here? I heard that my star performer had cold feet. You came back for me? What are you doing out here instead of in there? I was scared. It's okay to be scared. But you need to take that emotion and turn it into courage, remember? It's harder than it sounds. Yes. It is. But I promise you it's worth it. And we can do it together. You ready? I'm ready. Let's go. Until, uh... Hey, everyone. Trisha, you're back. Uh, you guys can go prepare. Just in time. You came. I did. What are you doing here? It sounded like you needed my help. I did. I do. I never expected you to come back. This is where I wanna be. I thought the art exhibit was your big dream. It was. Or at least I thought it was. But when I looked around the room at all the strangers, I realized that what I really wanted was to be here with our students. And with you. This is also my dream. Being around you inspires me. You make me feel this spark of excitement for life and for art, and... And for love. For love? Jake, I uh... Liv, ever since you spilled beet smoothie on my shirt, you made my heart skip a "beet." Merry Christmas, everyone. Please welcome to the stage our first performers, Trisha Jones and Bobby McMillan. So, what do you think? I think this is the perfect start, to the perfect night to a perfect Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.
