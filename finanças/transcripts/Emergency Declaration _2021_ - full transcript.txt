IF AN AIRCRAFT CANNOT FLY SAFELY DUE TO LACK OF FUEL OR OTHER PROBLEMS THE PILOT MAKES A DECLARATION TO THE AUTHORITIES. THIS PLANE THEN HAS FIRST PRIORITY TO LAND BEFORE ALL OTHER AIRCRAFT. IN THE WORLD OF AVIATION, IT IS LIKE PROCLAIMING MARTIAL LAW. ALL ELSE CEASES, AND THE PLANE'S NEEDS SUPPLANT ANY OTHER ORDER. EMERGENCY DECLARATION We'll probably have to circle a couple times before landing. Yes, traffic looks heavy. What? Someone you know? No. Which plane will have a lot of people on it? Excuse me? It's summer, so maybe vacation spots? Do many people fly to Southeast Asia? What's your destination, sir? I want someplace far away, where a lot of people go. What? Nothing, sir. How many people are on that 1:40 flight? We're not authorized to give out that information. I'm just asking how many people. Why do you ask? I'm just curious. Is there a problem? No, it's just it might inconvenience other passengers-- Inconvenience them? How? What I mean is, we're not allowed to reveal passengers' personal data. Hey. Yes? For god's sake, don't smile like that. You look like a whore. What loud get-together are they doing now? It's not that loud. It's community spirit. When it finishes, go get some meat. Meat? Just eat ox bone soup. Ox bone soup? Where? Did Mom go somewhere? On vacation, of course! She's going without you. You always cancel. Do you hate vacations or something? Of course not. Why wouldn't I want to go? When will she be back? When the soup's gone! I'm sick of it already. Gosh. This is two weeks' worth! Scratching again? You need to stop yourself. - I know. - Wait a second. I'll put on some ointment. Can I go to the restroom? The restroom? Sure, let's go. We've been waiting so long. I'll go myself. Will you? Ladies and gentlemen, Sky Korea will begin boarding shortly. Bring your own mirror! You will be boarding at Gate One. Why don't you answer your phone? I've got things to do at the airport, why? Is it my fault I can't go? Something came up at work. That's what always happens! Always? It was just this one time. And the last time. Whatever. Did you put the soup in the fridge? Of course, after you went to that trouble. As soon as it cooled, I divided it into portions. It's 15 days' worth! Don't order delivery! I'm busy, bye! What a woman. Why does she always pick blue? Hello? Soo-min! Soo-min. - Dad! - Why are you in here? I was so worried. What happened? Was there a line in the women's restroom? Thank goodness. Why so early, after working last night? You should sleep. A fight in my precinct, had to cancel my vacation. Who gave us the watermelon? Everyone's eating it. Two weeks of ox bone soup for me. Why should we go? You got the call. And you're closer! Oh, whatever. What is it? A bunch of school kids reported something. The head office wants us to check it out. What'd they report? Some idiot uploaded a video threatening to attack a plane. The kids think it's their neighbor. Attack a plane? Yeah. Today, he says. Today? Thank you. Why's he talking in English? He didn't say which plane? No mention of which plane. He's just saying he'll attack a plane. You understood that? Such long sentences. Is there someone we can ask? In English they all speak long sentences. It's advanced English. I understood everything! It's just a prank. Who would announce it on the internet? And you think it's easy to attack a plane? With all the security and checking they do. It's not far from here, - right? - Huh? Might as well stop by. - I'll go myself. - Sergeant, I'm sure it's just a prank! I know, I just feel like taking a walk. You're really going? Hey, where did Mom say she was going? I'm in class. Bye. Hey! Min-jung! Bear it a bit longer. The air is so clean there, this will clear up really fast. How old are you? What a cute girl. Jesus. - Going on vacation? - What? I don't see her mom. Do you have a wife? Where are you flying to? Ah, Hawaii. Let's go, Soo-min. You're divorced, aren't you? Do you know me? No. Then why stick your nose in our business? I'm just asking. Why? Why do you think? Grilling me about my wife. Why do you care? What did the kid say? What is your damn problem? She said something about me. Are you insane? Leave us alone! Damned freak. This video, it's advanced English, and you can't see his face. If you kids are just pulling a prank, then those four dollars ice creams, Haagen-Dazs. I'll make you pay me back for those. It's him! I recognized him right away. If you turn up the screen's brightness, you can see. High-level English? It's elementary school level. A rich neighborhood like this, the kids get advanced instruction. Anything else strange about this guy? Was there? I don't think so. Last time he put his garbage by someone else's home. So there was a big fight. A prank, right? Sarge, let's go back. You've had your walk. These apartments may look old, but given the neighborhood, a single unit costs four million dollars. If we get reported for breaking and entering, You know what rich people are like. What's that smell? Trash. Our home smells like that sometimes, too. - Let's go. - You want to go in? No. Oh my, your door is open. Hello? When would you like the return flight from Hawaii? I'll just take the flight there. One way. What's this? For my asthma. You can go. The weather looks bad from Japan on. Yes, the turbulence could be strong. We'll carry some extra fuel. And I'll do my best to avoid turbulence, but if we hit a rough patch, I'll signal twice and announce it. Yes, thank you. Let me check your seat. Here. Take a seat. Welcome on board. Excuse me. - What did you want? - Where did Mom go? Hawaii. Wait up! Let me check your ticket. This way, please. - Welcome. - We almost missed the flight. - Sorry! - That's okay. It's down this aisle. All 121 passengers are now on board. We'll close the door. You can close the door now. Thanks for your help. - Fasten seatbelts, please. - We'll be taking off soon. Fasten your seatbelts. Here's a tranquilizer. Why didn't you send Yun-cheol in instead? I told him to, but he refused. I thought my heart had stopped. - Sergeant! - What? Something's odd. We'll need an autopsy, but there's a skull fracture. Lots of bleeding, too. Is that what killed him? What's strange is, that doesn't seem to be the cause of death. Given the burst capillaries and coughed up blood... What's that? It looks like poison. Yun-cheol, you put him on the wanted list? Yes. Hey, Sergeant. What? I think you'd better look at this. I'll go get some rest. Sure, rest up. I want to try that. Isn't this pretty? Look. Wow, that's pretty. Excuse me, sir. I'm the chief flight attendant. You've been drinking a lot, are you okay? I'm fine, just give me more. Would you like a cool beverage? No, some alcohol. Sorry, but our regulations prohibit the amount of alcohol-- My dad's scared of flying. Soo-min! That's why he's drinking. He's scared. Don't be ridiculous. Adults aren't scared of flying. Shall I bring what you've been having? Should I stop? I'll be fine. Very well. That's poison? No, it looks contagious. Contagious? The rats that don't touch the powder are dying, too. Burst veins, internal bleeding... Looks like a virus. A virus can't last long in a solution. So it's bred in a culture, and then frozen in powder form. You got the test kit? The time keeps getting shorter. Getting shorter? He's measuring how long it takes the virus to propagate. Trying to shorten the incubation period. What for? Why shorten the incubation period? Sergeant! He tests positive. He was killed by the virus. Going to the restroom? Are you? Are you scared of me? I'm not a bad person. Go ahead. I'm sorry, it's really urgent! Wow, you're a lucky kid. Call me as soon as you find anything. Got his location? Did he board a plane? This guy has no cell phone, no credit cards. We can't trace him. Let's go to the immigration office. How long will it take? What is this? What the hell? - Do you have a pen? - Hey! - Can I borrow one? - I'll bring you one, sir. - Yes? - The restroom there... There was someone in business, so I went to economy, but something's falling from the ceiling! How cheap can you get? My apologies, sir. I'll check it immediately. So why'd you go to economy? The one here was occupied. Stop brushing off. - Why won't she answer? - The phone is powered off. Please tell me he's not flying to Hawaii. What about Hawaii? The light's green. Go. What's that? What? It's the airline's wi-fi. You need a credit card, nine dollars an hour. Crazy expensive, and super slow. Such a rip-off. I mean this video. What is it? My friend sent me this, trying to freak me out. This guy's threatening a terrorist attack on a plane. Can I take a look? - What? - Let me see. Sure. I'm sure it's a prank. Where did Soo-min go? Soo-min? Soo-min, why are you here? What's wrong? What happened? - It's too dark to see. - I'm sure it's him! Imagine him in a suit. It's identical! He smuggled something onto the plane in his armpit. I don't think it's an explosive. But it could be a weapon. Like a small knife. You know what he told my daughter? Tell her. What did the man say? It's okay, Soo-min. You can tell her. What did that man say? That everyone here is going to die. Excuse me, sir. Yes? I'm sorry, but can I see your ID or business card? Why all of a sudden? A passenger claimed you said something improper to her. What did I say? Ah. He's a scientist. A scientist? He says he's attending a conference in Hawaii, and denies saying anything. But your daughter doesn't seem to be lying. We'll keep a close eye on him. Try not to worry. Si-young, that steak in the oven, can you take it out? Sure. That's for the copilot, and seaweed soup for the pilot. He doesn't eat meat. Right. - I brought your meals. - Thanks. Seaweed soup for you, Captain, and steak for the copilot. - Thank you. - Huh? I want steak, too! But you don't eat meat. That's when I was taking herbal medicine. Nearly drove me crazy. I'm always catching colds, and they last forever. - I'll bring you steak, then. - Thanks. No, don't bother. You take this, I'll have soup. - Here you go. - It's no problem to change it. No need for that. - Thanks! - Thank you. Oh, my. How many hours will you fly this month? He boarded a flight. Ryu Jin-seok. - Not someone with the same name? - The ID numbers match. Where... Where's it going? Which flight? KI501. To Honolulu. Oh, thank god! It's okay. Wait, Honolulu is... in Hawaii? - What? - It's Hawaii, right? - Jung Hye-yoon. - Why are you going on about Hawaii? What? What is it? Well... What's wrong? So, can you turn back the flight? You're the airline. You can do it, right? Let go of me! What do you know? We're police officers. No, it'll be best just to grab him. Grab him on the plane. Okay? Listen up! Tell the security guard-- There's no guard, it's not a bank. Why no security guard? Airplanes don't have them. You should've followed through on your swing last time. I'm telling you, I did. Why do you keep scratching yourself? What is this? Why's it so itchy? And I've got the chills. Did you eat something rotten? What did you eat this time? You've got no evidence, if you keep on like this-- A man with a body in his home made a terror threat! If we start a scene in the plane, passengers could get hurt-- This is much more serious than that! Seeing that video... This is no ordinary criminal. You know about viruses? - Yes. - Biological terror. That's what this is. If we don't move fast, it'll be too late. If you're not convinced, I'll take full responsibility. So before it's too late... I can't believe this. Blood? My eye! Help! Over here! Doctor! Is there a doctor? Doctor! - Pil-ho! - Are you okay? - Hey! - What's going on? Is there a doctor? Help. Is there a doctor? Any doctor here? A doctor... A doctor... Any doctor here? A doctor? - Oh my... - Pil-ho! Stewardess! Wait, I'm a doctor. He's dead. - What? - No. Excuse me. What's this? A terror attack? Is the satellite phone working? It must be down, if they sent it as text. Check it. Where are you going? Here it is, Ryu Jin-seok. - I'll go check. - Okay. I said where are you going? - You did this, right? - What did I do? Asshole. It was you, bastard! Let go of me! A male passenger in section 36 Charlie has died. You did something, right? You hid something in your armpit. What are you doing? Look! What's this? What did you hide here? You said you'd kill everyone! You freak! What's going on here? You need to catch him! Mr. Ryu Jin-seok, right? Date of birth, December 1, 1985? Sorry, but can I see an ID? You're Ryu Jin-seok! You speak Korean! What? - Shit! - Grab him! Grab him! Soo-min, look out! Soo-min, it's okay. Grab his hand! Help me! Help! Over here! Something just came! It's from the plane? Ryu Jin-seok has been isolated, but one passenger has died. A man in his 40s, coughing up blood and covered in blisters. Sergeant, are you okay? Get something sweet like chocolate. I'm okay. Excuse me! Via technical exchanges, Korean firms can obtain C-ITS certification... C-IS... Why can't I memorize anything today? Did I make it too difficult? No, these terms... Minister Kim! We are currently gathering more information. Please don't be alarmed, and wait in your seats. We'll be fine, right? Sure, it'll be okay. Let's get some sleep. He was sprinkling something. What? It wasn't a knife? - Was it a knife? - Was anybody hurt? They said not. Only a few hours left, we'll be fine. Hey! Sorry. Long time no see. Right. Are you okay? You're not hurt? No. Did that guy carry out some terror attack? He threatened to. He's suspected of murder, too, so we've detained him for now. I knew there was something weird about him. From the first time I saw him. I saw you before. At the airport. I wasn't sure, but I never knew you were on this plane. Oh, really? I didn't see you. - Why didn't-- - I hoped I was wrong. Because I never wanted to see you again. It was in here. The man who died said that powder was falling on his head. - Powder? - Yes. Want to cover your mouth? So you don't catch a cold. They look high-ranking. She's arriving now. We set up an operations team at the airline. I'll call you back. Thank you. What's the situation? The copilot is keeping us updated. For now, apart from the one fatality, everything is calm. What a nightmare. Shouldn't the plane turn back? We're discussing it, but it seems urgent to get them off that plane, so we're talking to the US about finding a nearby airport. Since there's never been a bioterror attack in a plane before-- Shouldn't we call a press conference? Once things become clearer. Let's analyze the situation first. I'm Park Tae-su from the President's Crisis Management Center. Okay. Why don't you come back? - Something strange is going on. - What? The suspect spread something in the restroom and cabin, then an exposed passenger died, and many passengers have started coughing. I also went inside the restroom, so I'm calling, just in case. You feel okay? I'm okay, but the attendant Si-young has a fever, and Captain Jang isn't feeling well either. So I think for now it's better if you stay alone. Okay, call me. These photos are from the plane. The blisters and bleeding match what we saw on the corpse at Ryu's house. Ryu already dispersed the white powder in the plane, and if we have the first casualty, that means the virus is spreading. So the infections will multiply rapidly. Not only that, this aircraft is a 20-year-old model, and the ventilation reuses air from inside the plane. So the virus, which appears to be airborne, will circulate. It's the ideal environment for a virus. They're saying it's a terrorist attack. Everyone stay calm. Don't let the passengers see you looking worried, okay? Yes, ma'am. Are you okay? I'm a bit dizzy. If I rest for a sec, I'll be okay. Can you get up? Is there any existing virus with similar traits? To prepare a response-- It's an intentional act of bioterrorism, so it'll be hard to find anything comparable in nature. And far more lethal. What do we do? I'm scared. Hey, don't be a wuss! It'll be fine. It's okay. I'm scared too. I SAW YOUR POST ON INSTAGRAM. Reporters are texting like crazy. The video I took, I uploaded it to Instagram. But the wi-fi is so slow. Too many people using the internet. Try again in 2 or 3 minutes. Ryu Jin-seok worked for a pharmaceutical company? Yes, he quit four years ago. He was head of microbiology at the multinational firm BRICOM. We tried contacting them to get more info, but their headquarters are overseas, and they're not very cooperative. They say he quit years ago, and this incident has nothing to do with them. They keep repeating they have nothing to tell us. The situation is so desperate, and you're just going to let it go? Use the power of the state if you have to. Yes, but we have no evidence directly linking them to this case, and if we investigate or force them to testify, it could cause problems. We are public servants. It's our job to take responsibility. I'll try another channel. Ryu's mother was a microbiologist, too. She published several papers in overseas scientific journals. They went to the US in 1994 and returned in 2002. She finished her Ph.D. just as Ryu entered school, so it seems they went for Ryu's education. Can you contact her? She died of natural causes in February. Let's negotiate with Ryu. This is an unknown virus with a short incubation period. If he just wanted to kill people, he could do it on land. He chose a plane, so he must have some other goal. And the internet threat suggests he likes an audience. If he wants something, we can give it to him. If not, all those... It's too dangerous for those passengers. Can you hear me? Yes. Mr. Ryu Jin-seok? What? Can you tell us why you did all of this? Did what? Do you want something? You must have a reason. So you'll give it to me? Right now, officials from the government are listening to this call. Tell him we'll do what he wants. Do you want something? They say they'll do it. Then listen up. I'll tell you clearly. The people on this plane, I want them all to die. Shall I repeat myself? I want everyone on this plane to die! Every single one! Why? It seems like fun. It's fun when people die? No. It's fun seeing people trapped, dying one by one. Like rats. This is a plane! So there's nowhere to run, it will be chaos! Running won't save you. - You crazy bastard! - Sir! Tell him to stay calm. Why? It's all just words. What nonsense is this? You know how many people are on this plane? You think I wanted this? You think I wanted to do this? Ryu Jin-seok! You need to learn just how much it hurts, you garbage. Stop this nonsense and tell me. Where's the treatment? Where's the vaccine? You must want to live! Tell me! You think I boarded this plane planning to live? I boarded it to die. With all of you. Idle! Speed brake! Pull up. Are you okay? Ryu Jin-seok is dead. Captain Won is dead. And the terrorist, Ryu Jin-seok is also dead. What did you say? He said he's not hurt, he just passes out sometimes. I think he has fear of flying, too. Fear of flying? Not him, surely. What? He used to be a famous pilot. DEATH REPORTED ON FLIGHT TO HONOLULU Minister. SUSPECTED TERRORISM The story broke. This just in. A death has occurred... POSSIBLE TERRORISM ON SKY KOREA 501 ...on a Sky Korea flight from Incheon to Honolulu. Even more disturbing, the presumed cause is terrorism. This video was taken by a passenger on the plane and sent via the airline's internet service. The suspect Ryu being detained in this video threatened an attack on a plane yesterday. DEATH CAUSED BY SUSPECTED TERROR This is all the info we have at the moment, but according to passengers' reports from the plane, the plane is experiencing violent turbulence and passengers are in a state of extreme terror and confusion. Despite this, neither the airline nor the government have responded to calls for clarification. As reported in the press, the suspect Ryu uploaded a terror threat on the internet, and carried out a biological terror attack on the plane. This virus is highly contagious and in contrast to naturally occurring diseases, - appears to be extremely lethal. - Is he that person from before? He's dead? We have learned that the terrorist himself has died of the virus, and Captain Won Dong-yeon died after being infected. Shouldn't we check on this? Hey, stewardess! Stewardess! - The government is - Stewardess! cooperating with the US to land the plane and address the situation as quickly as possible. Dear passengers, family members and citizens, we ask for your trust... - It's a virus? Extremely lethal? - ...as we work to find a solution. The pilot got infected and died! Then are we all going to get infected? We'll all get infected? Why won't the phone work? Because everyone's calling. Everyone's trying. Pil-ho died of that virus. I was next to him! Are you serious? - Stewardess! - I'm sorry. - Just a minute. - Wait! Stop! Tell us something! Don't we need to get off? Meanwhile, police have turned the investigation public and released details about the suspect. His name is Ryu Jin-seok. He worked as a senior researcher at a multinational pharmaceutical firm. As of now, a Counterterrorism Task Force has been set up at the airport, and family members of passengers are arriving at a nearby meeting room. Check all CCTVs near that house, and see if there were any visitors. It's chaos here! I don't know how the location got leaked but even if we say it's safe, it's pandemonium here. A disinfectant truck just arrived. Dad, is Mom on that plane? A call came from her. You can call from a plane? Yes, on that one. She just said a few words, then it disconnected. Where are you? They said the families are at the airport, so I'm going there. Don't worry, she'll be fine. She never catches a cold. We can't get to the plane, this is driving me crazy. Where did that bastard work? BRICOM. If they won't cooperate, it means they're hiding something. Otherwise, why not talk? - Hey, what's wrong? - Nothing. Just dizzy. I'm just dizzy. Hey! - Please call someone! - Stewardess! No, I'm okay. Si-young's in trouble! Si-young! Si-young! I'm scared. I can't do it. I can't do this anymore! The passengers are in an uproar. They want us to isolate the infected. Those with blisters on their skin, go to the tail. Those who are still okay, to the front. The doctor is at the back! If you feel even a little sick, have a fever, or have developed blisters, please move to the back of the plane. Hold on. Is that a blister? What do you mean? It's eczema. - It looks like a blister. - It's not that! Do you have a doctor's certificate? Why would I carry a doctor's certificate for eczema? Come on, Soo-min. Dad, can we just go to the back? No. No way. Dad, let's just go. Okay? No, this is just eczema. You don't need to go there. - Mister-- - Let go of me! You can't just try to save yourselves! Aren't I right? Aren't I? Dad, let's just go. Please let's go! Are you okay? Those with blisters, in the back. Sorry. It's because of me. You've nothing to be sorry about. It's okay. - Can you hand me that pillow? - Yes. Hand me her medicine. An Emergency Response Team, with the aviation policy director, Transport Minister Kim Sook-hee, Health Minister Jeong Mi-ok, and Kim Myeong-sik of the Korea CDC are all departing for the US. They will address the situation as soon as they land. Meanwhile, we are receiving more info on Ryu Jin-seok. WAITING ROOM FOR FAMILIES He was extremely quiet as a child. Neighbors describe him as somewhat peculiar, with an incident over trash resulting in conflict. Given all this, some are comparing him to the Las Vegas shooter. First, he's an elite, from a wealthy background. His apartment is expensive. So he's not expressing some kind of rage towards society. Like the Place St. Lambert incident in Belgium when a man attacked this sort of attack is unexplained, with victims chosen at random. And the culprit also killed himself. It's known as "extended suicide." Now we have disasters of this sort as well. Disasters are arbitrary. People became victims for being in a certain place at a certain time. Just a minute, Captain. Excuse me. How about moving the second pilot to the bunker? It seems dangerous here. But I think it's more dangerous there. The terrorist's body and the passengers who died are there. - How many PO2s do you have? - What? Oxygen cylinders for the cabin. Not the overhead masks. I guess about 20 of them. How about using them on passengers with trouble breathing? Here's a fever reducer. You need to hold on until we land. Look at all those reporters. Those BRICOM assholes. There's no time for this. There's no warrant yet. Not enough evidence, it seems. We don't have time for this now! You're obstructing an investigation! Just cooperate, okay? Step aside. We've nothing to do with this case! If you want to come in, get a warrant! We got the warrant, right? We got it already. Don't lie to me. Follow the procedures, show some connection to the case, and then come back! You asshole! Try to pierce through! Sir, this... Hello? We've tried contacting senators, the White House, but it's no use. I'm sure you know, the longer they stay in that plane, the more dangerous it is. They absolutely refuse. They said they can't take that risk without knowing anything. If we wait longer, the plane may not have fuel to get back. On their way back, we'll try somehow to let them land in another country. Yes, sir. We're turning back. Give the order. Sky Korea 501, we'd like you to turn back. Did you hear me? Please return to Incheon. First Officer Choi? I hear you. KI501 is turning back. - Check fuel levels! - KI501 is turning back! Flight KI501, after suffering an unprecedented terror attack, is reportedly turning back to Korea. Passengers had been about to land for treatment, but it's unclear what happened... Just a minute. Are we turning back? We saw the news. I'm sorry. This is insane. Turn back? How can we wait that long? Damn, I can't do it! I can't wait any longer! Land in Hawaii now! Right now! The US won't let us in. They refused to let us land, so we're turning back. We'll all die this way. KI501 TURNS BACK Hello? Honey! - Honey! - Honey? - You hear me? - I hear you. How are you? Are you okay? How is Min-jung? She's fine. Is your health okay? You're not hurt? I'm okay. But it's total chaos here. I'm scared. Just hold out a bit longer. We're working on a solution. You are, right? You can fix things? Don't worry. Hello? Honey? Hello? Hello? The plane's turning back? The US didn't let them land? That's the current situation. What's the situation in the plane? Luckily, there's a doctor onboard, and the flight crew are doing their best. What's your plan for when it lands? The quarantine system will be formed shortly. - Just a minute! - Please tell us something! I'm so angry. We've become his guinea pigs. - Sergeant! - Did we get the warrant? No, but someone who saw you on TV is on the phone. She wants to talk to you. She's a BRICOM employee. Hello? - I... - Yes? This can't be traced, right? Not at all! I'm speaking outside. Or recorded? No, this is an iPhone, so it can't record calls. - Don't worry. - You've no connection to BRICOM? No, you saw me fighting them on TV. Yes, please go ahead. Things are in an uproar here. So I have to be careful. I understand. This is a sensitive situation, I know. It seems like someone here conspired with Ryu Jin-seok. As soon as he saw the news, he rushed home, as if fleeing. Ma'am! This way please, it's not safe here. Who is it? I've got a delivery. Just a minute. Shouldn't we pick the lock? Sergeant, he jumped out the window! Damn it! Hey, second floor! Grab him, quick! Stop right there! That way! Climb over! Climb over it! Can't you get over this? Shit, twisted my leg... My scooter! Stop, you asshole! Grab him, hurry! Catch him! Why are you running? Get in the car. - You coward! - Why call me that? Chase him! - Go faster! - Up front! Out of the way! Turn left. Left! - Go faster! - I am going fast. My goodness. Right, turn right! Right. Come on. A little faster. - Step on it! - I'm trying! Hey, that's too fast! On his tail! Too fast! What am I supposed to do? Watch out! Oh Sung-hoon. You're Oh Sung-hoon, right? What? It's not like that. Why are you chasing me? You punk. You're arrested as an accomplice in the terror attack. Come here! Are you okay? Shit. You jerk. Mister, don't talk. You're bleeding a lot. We need an ambulance here! Somebody! - Damn it! - You say you're not an accomplice. Then why'd you run? I was scared. He tricked me too, that bastard! He kept saying he was unfairly fired from BRICOM. I thought he deserved pity. What are you saying? What happened was... A few years ago, we received a mutated virus from the Middle East. Called SC-1, highly infectious, hemorrhagic and very dangerous. But three of our researchers got exposed to the virus. The person in charge was... Ryu Jin-seok. The only person who survived told the police that Ryu intentionally exposed them. Ryu said he was unfairly accused. There was no evidence, but the survivor was adamant. The company had brought the virus in secretly, so they insisted it was an accident, and Ryu was fired without any charges filed with the police. But that bastard Ryu with his innocent face begged me to send him a sample, saying he wanted to clear his name and get rehired... There's a survivor? Where's the person who survived? The corpse from Ryu's house. They said they'd incubate the virus from the body, was it done? Can they determine what kind of virus it is? Yes, it only takes two hours, so they must have a result. Sky Korea 501! Sky Korea 501! Your velocity is Mach 0.85. Is this correct? Yes. Why are you flying so fast? Is something wrong? Have you secured any landing spot on the return route? We're negotiating. Is something wrong? I don't feel so well. When did that appear? Indeed. Take a shot of the fever reducer. No, there aren't enough. You're the chief flight attendant. Everyone's looking to you, attendants and passengers. I was planning to quit after this year. Get my sister married, and then quit. She should get herself married. Why rely on you? You're right. - I'll quit when we land. - Yes, quit right away. You were a pilot? A long time ago. Why did you quit? Sir! One of the passengers is a pilot. Captain Park Jae-hyuk. Alpha grade, lots of experience. But... The weather was terrible that day, too. First Officer Choi. One of the passengers is a pilot. Did you know that? Not long before landing, one of the engines caught fire. I wanted to make an emergency landing, but the control tower in Norway disagreed. They said the wind was too strong, to turn back and land elsewhere. But with the engine trouble, I thought it safer to risk the wind. I heard about that. The airplane burned, but the passengers were all saved. Two flight attendants in the tail, helping passengers disembark died when it caught fire. Because passengers getting their luggage blocked the exit... One of the flight attendants... was First Officer Choi's wife. Maybe I should've listened to the tower instead of insisting. Thousands of times I've questioned myself. Ever since then... I just can't do it. When I board a plane, I can't even breathe... Chief attendant speaking. Remember that there's a pilot among the passengers? Park Jae-hyuk. Yes. We should get him prepared just in case. First Officer Choi! First Officer Choi! Ryu's mother had been a famous microbiologist. I don't remember her name. She used to pressure Ryu, and when he felt stressed, he'd get pleasure in killing animals. Of course we told the company and they made him stop, but... I think he did it to get revenge. I saw it with my own eyes. We were dying in the lab, and his eyes... They were laughing. His colleagues were writhing in agony, and he was smiling. I brought a sample of the virus from the corpse in Ryu's house. Would you be able to recognize it? How could I ever forget this? They found an antivirus. Are you sure? Yes, Ryu took the virus from BRICOM and used it in the attack. The virus from the dead body, and the virus studied at BRICOM are the same. How many forces can we deploy to the BRICOM? Are you okay, First Officer? Can you do it? You flew a 777 before, so it won't be much different. Technical support staff are standing by. So even if something happens, it won't be too hard. Are you crazy? You're going to kill us! Open up. There's no time. Open up! You bastards! Out of the way! No, it isn't! What's with you girls? Hey, what if you infect all the people here? Huh? - Get out, now! - No, it's not true! Will you stop it? - Stop what? - These girls could be your daughters. We can't all just try to save ourselves here! Look at this. Look, I saw that on you before. It's a blister, right? - You go, too! All of you! - Stop it! - Get out! - I said stop it! My god, don't you have kids? It's okay, girls. Come with me. There's a doctor there, it'll be okay. It's okay. Look at you. If you go out, you can't come back, you know? In this tiny plane, it seems a bit much to be kicking people out. We're just trying to survive! You'll die if you leave here. Look at how few are left. You chased everyone out. Just survive on your own, okay? Let's do this, people! Be strong! Soo-min! I came right back, right? Would you like this? Is Dad flying the plane? Yeah. He's scared of planes. Have you flown even once since then? I'm sure I can do it. I used to do it all the time. - You were going on vacation? - Not vacation. My kid has eczema. Other kids made fun of her for it. She was having a hard time. She's gotten quiet since my wife and I divorced. They say clean air can cure eczema. My friend has a light aircraft business there. He said they need an instructor. Teaching theory. Open the door, now! Show us the customs clearance for SC-1! You have an antivirus and vaccine! Bring the warrant! Show us evidence! You know this is illegal? Before we bring the warrant, you'd be smart to listen to him. Give us the vaccine and antivirus, and mitigate your crime! If this gets out, it won't end with you going bankrupt. Do you have proof? The virus released in the attack was taken by Ryu Jin-seok from a lab at his former employer BRICOM. Fortunately, BRICOM possesses an antiviral treatment and vaccine which they will provide to victims free of charge. They found a treatment! It was just announced! They found a treatment! The calls are coming in. It was on the news. They found a treatment! A treatment! They found a treatment! - We're going to live! - Is it true? - Is it certain? - Yes, it is. They found a treatment. They found a treatment. Really? That's great. What a relief. I knew they would. Hello? Honey! How did you find it? How do you think? That's what detectives do. Now you just need to get home. It's for the best. Korea's much better than Hawaii. Just hold on a bit longer. Okay, I will. - It's all thanks to you. - Minister! You made a great effort. It was nothing. I'm a public servant. Just doing my job. Actually, my wife is on that plane. I heard. Please help, Minister. Bring her back safely. All the way home. I will. Japan should accept us now, right? First Officer! We'll have to land at Narita. The weather was bad at takeoff, so we added some extra fuel, but I doubt there's enough to reach Seoul. And speaking honestly, neither one of us is in condition to fly. Kubo-san! KI501 seems to be turning towards us. What did you say? It's the plane that was hit with the bioterror attack. Sky Korea 501! Are you turning towards Japan? Yes. We're going to land at Narita. We need to discuss this with Japan. I'm sorry. I can't hold out any longer. I'm issuing an emergency declaration. KI501 issued an emergency declaration. Isn't Park Jae-hyuk there? It seems he's not in a state to fly. Japan? Ladies and gentlemen, to ensure your safety, we will land at Narita Airport. Come on, let's go to the back! During landing, the back is the safest! They're going to Japan? The pilot's condition is bad. It seems he was infected. There's a former pilot among the passengers, but it seems he's not in a state to fly. What's their response? No answer yet. We told them there's an antiviral and vaccine, and the pilot is sick. I'll call the Foreign Ministry. But... It'll be okay. We have a vaccine, after all. Don't worry, Sarge. Why not? We've got a treatment. Tokyo refused. They're ordering them to leave Japanese airspace. Try telling them again. Our team will leave now with the treatment. Try again. Tell them we absolutely need to land. She said try again, asshole! Sarge! What are you doing? This isn't so simple an issue. Our President has already tried calling. I can't last any longer. The plane is going to Narita. Five minutes to arrival. Order other planes to turn back. An unidentified object is approaching! Where did they go? It's appeared in front of them! Hey, Hyun-soo. They're still heading to Narita! They've fired warning shots. They're approaching closer. Permission to fire denied. Ladies and gentlemen, we will land soon. Due to shaking of the aircraft, please adopt the position for crash landing. First Officer Choi! The air force has appeared again! They're approaching head on! No, it's too dangerous! First Officer Choi! Hyun-soo! Hyun-soo! A moment ago, the Korean airliner KI501 trespassed into Japanese airspace, and the Air Self-Defense Force was mobilized. - Ignoring its given route, - Hyun-soo! Please bring the doctor. Hyun-soo. KI501 attempted to land at Narita Airport. It has now given up trying to land and is headed towards Korea. The Korean government asked us to grant landing permission, as it has antivirals and vaccines in its possession. However, Japan's Ministry of Health believes that this virus has a much shorter incubation period than the original virus, and so it is highly likely that this virus is a mutation. A government's first duty is to protect its citizens, so we had no choice but to avoid exposing our nation to danger. What's he saying? They said it would surely work! The Japanese government expresses its deepest regret to the Korean people, and hopes for KI501's safe passage to Korea. I guess there's no cure. They'll need at least a few months to test it. There's no cure? They said they found a treatment. They said we could live. Please don't move. We were concerned too, but what they said can't be denied. A shorter incubation period means the virus may have mutated. So the antiviral may be effective, or may not. It's not 100% certain. Min-jung. Dad, is it true what they said? Is it really not a cure? Public opinion is worsening after Japan's refusal. Are we still planning on Seoul Air Base? What do you mean? We prepared negative pressure isolation rooms for treatment. Given public opinion, and the situation... Forty people have died already, and we can assume the survivors are all infected. If they land quickly, we'll collect their permission and start testing on the infected at once. It doesn't work? If it's so deadly, and after it lands, the treatment doesn't work and even one more person gets infected, who will take responsibility then? That's why the US and Japan refused them. We need to accept them. People on the ground are our people, too. We need to think of the danger that comes as soon as the plane lands. Right now, we need to think of minimizing the damage. Are you saying we should shoot it down, or just let it run out of fuel? Has anyone here said such a thing? If we don't decide now, that's what will happen. Dad. Dad! The treatment doesn't work? Sergeant. Sergeant! The President is considering what to do, so let's wait. What's going on? If there's a treatment, why did Japan send the air force? Things are not good. We're not sure about the treatment. The weather is not good. If the motor overheats, the autopilot may not operate. I should go to Seoul Air Base? Can you hear me? Seoul? Sergeant. Sergeant! What are you doing? Listen closely. You see the virus there? I'll inject myself with it, since I'll never get permission. Once I do, call Minister Kim. Tell her to give me the antivirus, and if I live, let the plane land. I know what you mean, but Sarge, please don't do this. You know how scary that is. You saw what that survivor in the hospital looked like. There's no time, and no other way. If we dilly-dally, those people will all die. We can't stand by. We have to do all we can. I won't let my wife die this way, okay? Stay still! Bloody hell, Sarge. Minister. Sergeant Koo injected himself with the virus. Yes, Mr. President. As for me, I think it's just too dangerous. Yes. Yes, sir. What the hell? You're not going to let us land, either? We're the Korean Air Force. Welcome to Korea. We'll escort you home. I think this is wrong. We can't turn back. We'll suffer a much bigger tragedy. From here, you need protective clothing. Is it true the plane is being escorted to Seoul Air Base? It is currently traveling safely. Do you have measures in place? We have a system to provide quarantine and treatment. What will you do if the virus spreads? There's basically no treatment, will Seoul have to evacuate? Family members, we will move to Seoul Air Base. The airplane is going there. Let's go! Meanwhile, on the Blue House's website, a petition has been uploaded arguing against the plane's landing, given uncertainties about the treatment's effectiveness, while simultaneously a rival petition argues the plane should land and passengers should receive treatment. ONLINE PETITION He just rushed in, with his gun drawn... More antivirus! More! We're going to Seoul Air Base, right? Do you hear me? The landing site has changed. What do you mean? It's not Seoul Air Base? Did something happen? I'm told that at Seoul Air Base, there are demonstrators. Don't land! PROTESTORS UP AGAINST POLICE OFFICERS PROTESTORS UP AGAINST POLICE OFFICERS BIOCHEMICAL MISSILE KI501, CITIZENS EXPRESS RAGE AT GOVERNMENT PROTESTORS OCCUPY SEOUL AIR BASE LANDING FOR WHO? - SHOOT IT DOWN WITH A MISSILE. - STAY AWAY. A 40% FATALITY RATE WILL KILL US ALL. DO YOU REALLY HAVE TO LAND? They're telling us to die? We all need to survive. Just trying to save themselves. That's what you did, too. When we were sick. PROTESTORS UP AGAINST POLICE OFFICERS PROTESTORS SHOUT SLOGANS AT SEOUL AIR BASE With the protests, there are no airports where they can land. They're just circling in the air now. Sergeant! Oxygen levels are dropping. More antiviral! More antiviral! Bloody hell. - Captain. - Yes? No need to feel hurt. For me too, my wife dying, it wasn't your fault. But I couldn't stop myself from hating you. At times like this, people get weak and scared. FAMILIES ON THE MOVE DUE TO PROTESTS - No landing! - No landing! - Keep away! - Keep away! Why are you following us? FAMILIES ON THE MOVE DUE TO PROTESTS Min-jung came too. Why? Don't follow after us. FAMILIES ON THE MOVE DUE TO PROTESTS THEY ARE OUR FAMILIES TOO! PLEASE LET THEM LAND! SOME PROTESTORS IN FAVOR OF PLANE'S LANDING There are also people saying we should land. Telling us to come back. Is it really right for us to land? What if we pass this on to all of them? What are you talking about? We still need to live! I won't die this way. Yun-seok, look. - Blisters. On your arm. - Blisters... But I wore gloves. Let's not land. Let's just not land. What if my daughter and husband get sick? Better for me to suffer. Let's not land. Doctor. If we land, can we live? - Soo-min. - Dad! Why are you crying? What's wrong? Dad, can we just not land? I don't want to infect my friends. I always worried my friends would catch eczema. The passengers and flight crew have all been infected. They all say they don't want to land. Because it's too dangerous. They... don't want to do that to others. Do you have eczema, Dad? Did you catch it from me? I told you. Eczema isn't contagious. Even if we have to force the protestors out, we must land that plane. There's a message being broadcast from KI501. This is Sky Korea 501. Can you hear me? We hear you. All of us here aboard this plane have decided not to land. What do you mean? For me as well, everything happening now... is shocking and frightening. We know what people on the ground are scared of. We don't resent them. It's just that we were caught in a disaster that none of us wanted. We are... weak and frightened humans. But because we are human, there are things that only we can do. Now we intend... to make a decision for everyone's sake. This decision... is to not give in to this disaster, and make the honorable choice with our humanity. Therefore, we won't land. For the last time... For the last time, we send our love to all our families. Now we will end all communications. Mom. Hello? - Min-jung. - Mom! - Min-jung? - Mom? Mom, where are you? Where are you? Mom... I love you, Min-jung. I'm sorry. Grandma, I'm so scared. I'm sorry for saying your food tasted bad. I miss your food. I really looked forward to our family trip. Dad, those supplements I bought, be sure to take them regularly. Jun-hyuk, look after your mother and sister, okay? Look after them. Behind there, I hid some money. Buy the candy you like. Hey! I love you! Min-jung? Why doesn't it work? Min-jung. Min-jung, can you hear me? Min-jung. Min-jung. Min-jung! Sarge. Tell them to come. Tell them to come quickly. He's improving. The antivirus is working! - Is it certain? - Tell them all to come back. I'll take responsibility. The antivirus is working. Sergeant Koo is awake! - Contact them quickly. Tell them to come! - Yes, sir! Sky Korea 501. The treatment is effective. Come back immediately. We can't communicate! We can't reach them. Their radio's turned off! The passengers' phones work, right? Let the families know, quickly! We confirmed that the antiviral works! We can't contact the plane, so call your families and tell them. Tell them to come back! Call your families! The treatment works! - What's going on? - Call right now. Why can't I get through? Text messages work! We can't call, but text messages work! They say to come back. They say to come back! This is L2, Im Tae-eun. The antivirus works! They said it works! This is Sky Korea 501. I just heard some news from the passengers. Is it true? It's been confirmed! Please come back now! Did you hear me? Did you hear me say to come back? Yes, I heard. Thank you. Family members are cheering and hugging each other. Ladies and gentlemen, the plane is now about to land. Please return seats and tray-tables to their full upright position, and securely fasten your seatbelts. Please remain calm, and follow the flight crew's instructions. Fasten your seatbelts please. Please open the window blind and fasten your seatbelts. Please leave dangerous objects in our care. Demonstrators are quickly clearing from the air base. Citizens are now welcoming the plane's landing. Do you hear me? You're out of fuel, so the engine may turn off. You'll have to shut off power and glide to the runway. You should land at Suwon Air Base. If I'll be gliding, from cruising altitude to landing, I'll need about 20 minutes. I won't make it that far. You've got a tail wind, so it should be fine. I think Seongmu Airfield will be better. I landed there years ago when I did my training. That's too close. If you can't slow down, you'll overshoot the runway. With a tail wind, and only one runway, it's too dangerous! It's a head wind right now. The wind keeps changing direction every ten minutes. Is that forecast accurate? To hell with it. I'm going to Seongmu. Hey, First Officer Choi! I'm going to Seongmu. Honestly, I'm so sorry to you about what happened, but however much I think of it, I made the right decision back then. I think so, too. I'd have done the same. We're going to Seongmu. It's too dangerous! He'll be coming in fast, and the brakes might not work. If he can't reduce his speed, they'll crash beyond the runway. He's already turned the plane. No choice now. They're going to Seongmu, get ready! This just in. Facing a fuel shortage, KI501 has changed course and will land at Seongmu Airfield. They've lost power. They must be almost out of fuel. What's happening? What's going on? They're gone from the radar. The engine has turned off. Can you detect any radio waves? They're gliding now with the engines off. - They're headed for the runway! - It's too fast. At this speed they'll shoot past the runway! They've turned from the runway! He's circling to reduce velocity. What's my altitude reading? - Eight thousand feet. - Distance to runway? Six miles. The wind is changing. The speed is decreasing. Now's the time to land! It's turned again. It missed the landing! - What the... - I'm going around one more time. The altitude is plunging. They're going to crash! The engine just turned on. It seems they still had some fuel! Well, based on Ryu Jin-seok's internet search history, and data received from a forensic restoration of his hard drive, it seems that after the death of his mother, he became confused, lost his sense of identity and then began to plan this attack. What are your thoughts? Isn't that just speculation? It could just all be nonsense. I'm asking for your opinion. You must have one. If you're asking what I think, I can't understand or speculate why a normal person would decide to kill 150 people. But there exist some people who are steeped in a vice beyond reason. And they can take away those who are precious to us. Well, anyway, that's a question for the Minister of the Interior and Safety. I think Sergeant Koo's sacrifice was also remarkable, though the amount of virus he injected was so large. I understand he's no longer able to function normally? You ordered the landing without full verification. As a public official, don't you think it was too risky a decision? That's why I resigned. - Hello! - Soo-min, there you are! Hello! - Hello. - He's doing good, right? Sure, he's in the back. Everyone's there. How is he? Almost all better now. Doctor says he's so strong-willed, he'll be breathing on his own soon. Did you see him move his arm now? - Really? - Yes. Soon he'll be washing his face, and when Min-jung gets married, he'll probably be walking!
