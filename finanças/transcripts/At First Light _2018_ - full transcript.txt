[warning bells] [train horning] [deep humming] [loud ship horn] [car sirens] [loud low noises] [car starting] [Sean] Okay, hold on. [Oscar] Are you really selling everything? Yeah. Need the money. These are nice. Thanks. Do I want to know where you got them? Does it matter? No. [employee] How much do you want? [Sean] Thirty. [employee] Fifteen. [Sean] Twenty. [employee] I'll do twenty. - Not that. - Excuse me. - Excuse yourself. - Wait outside. This is extortion. Your mom had good taste. Keep it. Hey, if I ever see you in my house again, I'll break your arms. Yeah, I'll still have both my legs to kick you in the... Hey, asshole! And tell your sister to brush her teeth. [Oscar] I could take in that guy, I just needed like thirty seconds. Now he'll just keep coming back. [Sean] What did you even do to him? [Oscar] Nothing. Nothing. [Sean] Yeah. Bullshit. [Sean] Hit it, Robert. Hey, grandma. What'll t be today? Another shitty soap opera this is? Or UFC? Where's the rest of her pills for this week? I don't know. - Oh, we ran out. - When? Sunday? That was five days ago. Why are you telling me now? Does it matter? It's not like they work. Oscar. I'll go to pharmacy tomorrow. No, it's fine. I got it. I've signed this. And stop being a shit at school. "Oscar's been involved in three physical altercations this week". Say "ah". "He's been displaying behaviors that are against our bullying policy. Please contact the school immediately to schedule a meeting". Nope. [Nathan] Sean! Seany! Man, get your scrawny ass down here, come take me to this party. - Give me a minute. - All right. I'm coming up. No, no, stay there. I'm coming. I'm cooking down here, bro. Uh... I'm heading out. There's some cash on the kitchen counter. Just order a pizza and look after grandma. Just you and me. Hey, man, why you never invite me upstairs? It's messy. - Where did you get the gas? - Hey, don't worry about it. Yo, the night is going to be epic. Yeah? We don't even like these people. They don't even like me. True. Bro, how about you just try to be like a teenager for one night? Then you go back to being a single mom in the morning. All right, now unlock the door. Okay, bro, my bad about the mom. It's fine. No, no, you got to push. - Are you serious? - Yeah. The starter's shit, you got to push the car. Whoa, whoa! Hold up! Starter, my ass. [Nathan] What's going on? That's a fun night. Damn. Come on bro, we're here, baby. We're here. Look at the drink stand. What's going on, bro? Hey! What's happening? Snap. You know they got drinks... drinks over there? Yo, give me five, all right? Nathan! [music fades and soft music can be heard] [party music and indistinct chatter] Yep. She looks good. [Sean] I think she's with that Tom guy now. - For real? - Mm-Mm. Nah, I don't think that's official. I mean, Chris Harris says he's been making out with her every day after homecoming. Really? But you know we talk shit. You know that guy talks shit. All right, my man is a professional shit-talker. So, you... right? That can't... that's not true. She's... yeah, she's going to... she's coming right over. How is it going? Can't handle the cool kids? - I'm here for a refill. - Refill. Huh? You need me. I'm coming right now, bro. I'm coming right now. What's new? How's your grandma? - She's good. Yeah. - Good. - It's so sweet. - Yeah. Yeah. Actually she's not. She's like completely out of it. Most days she doesn't talk much anymore. Yeah. It sucks. Your stepmom? Still a bitch. - Is that real? - Yeah. Got it a couple months ago. It's... It means I'm the way and the truth and the light. Tom got one too. That was like a two for one thing. That's cute. Yeah. We thought so. So, you guys are like serious now? I don't know about serious, but we have fun. You mean you have sex. Jesus. - Sean, really? - So, yeah, I'm right. Yeah, you're right. Look, I don't know even know why you would care. You haven't spoken more than two words to me since we got off high school. I get that you were going through a lot. Don't do that. I don't want your pity. That's not what that is. I would have been there in a second if you asked. But you weren't. Have a great night. I hope that you're good. Yeah. I'm awesome. Bet you are. Alex. What? Can't we just talk? Like not here? Will you call me? I got a new phone. I don't have your number. Sorry. Jesus, Sean. Now you have it. - Hey. - Hey. Road's waiting. You coming? Have fun. We will. Sweet to have you. Do you feel it? I feel butterflies. It's okay. Just a moment. [Nathan] Hey, yo! Yo, yo, yo, yo. Yo, I need you to come and introduce yourself again to this girl so that she says her name again. It's like the "Yeladarah", but I can't... I think I'm done. - For real? - Yeah. Maybe it's written in her underwear. Genius. Quite the mob. Go home safe, alright? I care about you. Alex! Alex! Shit. [loud low noise] [Tom] Alex! Alex! Alex. Shit. What am I doing? Hey. Just get her legs. [man on TV] Behind me. I got your back. Cover me! I need a distraction! Goddamn it, Callaghan, watch your back! Protect your black ass! [radio] Overnight temperature has been dropped into the sixties and tomorrow's forecast... [radio interference] Hey. Are you okay? What happened to you? If you tell me where you live, I can take you back home. There. Are you sure you're okay? You're welcome. [loud car horn] [door being slammed] You need me to call the police? Anyone? Here, help yourself. [cell phone vibrating] Hello? Hello? Okay, I'm hanging up. [Alex] Please... don't. Alex? You okay? Yeah. What happened? Where are you? Where am I? Casey's Diner on 65. Hey. What happened? [employee] She showed up half naked. So, I gave her some clothes. I should call the cops. Please don't. I'll take her home. Alex. Come on. Let's go. You can crash at my place if you want. Just to give you a chance to sleep off whatever you took at the party. You want to change? Hey. Yeah. Your nose is bleeding. Just hold that. Just... wait. Okay. Lean your head back. Okay. Just... just... okay, okay. Let me see. Yeah, okay. I think it stopped. [clears his throat] You won't even... [radio] President Trump has not retreated on any of his strong positions on banning illegal aliens from entering the country following... [car not starting] [TV reporter] ...city's west side. One way of John Street is temporarily closed for ongoing construction. Signs of... Can I have this refilled, please? ...forbidding drivers to make a right turn off... Sure thing. Police have been on scene since last week cautioning drivers and issuing tickets. Officers say drivers tell them they don't see the sign or that they don't see the danger. But police say the risk is real for both motorists and construction workers. An eventful night in the Plano Valley. The southland blackout left three hundred thousand homes without power. The result of an electrical surge at a large transformer. It lit up the night's sky for several seconds prompting a flood of calls from concerned residents. Some have suggested a meteor or northern lights. Vandals have a struck a hole at near Hillcrest Park stealing two signs... High Street near Hillcrest Park's been problematic for pedestrians for years. Who's that? Residents complained that fast-moving traffic along the lot nearby crosswalks... Is that you, Janey? You're not Janey. ...is trying to locate 17-year-old Alex Lainey, reported missing early this morning. Last seen at the Southland Energy reservoir. - Reporter Jerry Bailey... - Thanks. ...is on the scene and she'll bring us up to date... [toilet flushing] Oh, fuck. Good morning, sweetheart. Where's your brother? Chocolate for breakfast, really? I'm going to the store. Get that mess cleaned up. Sean? [loud low noise] Shit! Hey, Sean, you got to see this. Look, this... this girl, you got to see what she can do. She has some crazy powers or something. - What, Alex? - Alex? We need to get you home. They think you're like missing or something. No, no, no, listen, you have to see this. Where's grandma? - She's gone. She went out. - What? She's fine. She went out. - Grandma! - No, she's fine. She's totally fine. - What do you mean? - I mean, she's completely okay. She's back to normal. What... Good morning. What's the matter with you two? Come on, help me put this stuff away. You're okay. Of course I'm okay. Sorry, this is Alex. I know. We've met. You know, some notice would be nice if someone's going to stay over. I mean, this place looks like a circus for the night. No offense. You know, you got Sean all love sick. - Jesus, grandma. - Don't you 'Jesus' me. You don't think she could see it? Look, your face is all flushed. It's lovely. Sean, set the table. Alex, how would you like your eggs? Haven't seen my grandma like that in, I don't know how long. That was crazy. Hopefully, she still remembers how to drive. Okay, we should hurry. Can't really have the cops coming to my house looking for you. Okay. What did he give you? Who? What do you mean, who? Tom, your boyfriend. Someone gave you a pill at the party. I can't remember anything. Then why didn't you ask him to pick you up when you're out with friends. Why me? Right. Where are you going? Your house is that way. Seriously? You don't remember where you live? Tell Tom to get better drugs. Or you could just get a better boyfriend. Okay. That was a joke. Alex, where the hell have you been? I'm sorry. They found all of your stuff by the reservoir. We thought you were dead. Why don't you step in, son? Mister Lainey, please. It's his wife. Hi, yeah. She just walked through the door. You're fine, right? Alex! I... I don't know. [stepmom] Alex! Just talk to them. You didn't do anything wrong. What? What is it? We shouldn't have come here. What's over those mountains? I don't know. Just hundred miles of desert. It's not just desert. - What? - [stepmom] Alex! Alex. Honey, just open the door, please. [sheriff] Alex. Can you just open the door for me? [stepmom] Alex, open the door. I think I should go. [sheriff] Alex! [stepmom] Alex, open the goddamn door right now! Alex, open the door right now! [stepmom] Alex! What? How did...? [stepmom] Alex! Come back here! Alex. Alex. Wait! Where are you going? I don't belong here. Alex? Alex! Alex! [Sean] Alex! Slow down! [radio] Caucasian female, five-seven, Alex Lainey, seventeen. Caucasian male, five-eight, seventeen in black and white number one, one, six, sending out AMBER Alert. You can just go back and tell them that I forced you to come with me. You did force me. You pushed me out of window. How did you know you could do that? I didn't know. It just happened. That doesn't just happen. [radio chatter] You got to tell me something, just anything so I don't feel like I'm losing my mind. I was under water. It's like I was drowning... I was drowning. I should be dead. But there was something in the water with me. I can still feel it. What does it feel like? So, you're like... what, like magnetic or something? I don't know. Wait. Okay. Do it again. Do what again? Your thing. Do it again. I don't know how to do it. I don't... it just happens. Just do what you did. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. Wait, wait, wait, just put it back. Just let me try one more time. Alex. Is it working? Damn it, I thought that I had it. [Alex screams] We need to get off the road. What can I get you? Sprite, Cherry Coke and two chicken fingers with fries. You okay? I'm fine. It's Cherry Coke. I know you hate that diet stuff. Well, you used to. You seriously don't remember anything? You know when you have a dream and it's so intense you think that it's actually happening? But then by the time you brush your teeth, it's all gone. That's how my life feels. I know that all this stuff happened, I just... I can't remember any of it. Up until last night when you picked me up. I'm glad you called me. Do you mean that? Yeah. I feel like we're Bonnie and Clyde. I don't know who that is. Chicken tenders. Thank you. Now listen, this ain't none of my business but those boys over there have been watching you for a while. Can I get this to go? Sure, baby. - Let's go. - What's wrong? Hey, you're Alex Lainey, right? I know you guys are like fugitives. Dude, what did I tell you? See? I thought you were dead. Where the hell have you been? Did he kidnap you? No. Whatever, just get in the truck, Alex. She's not going with you. I don't even know who you are, man. I'm taking you home to your family. Let's go. [Alex] Hey. - Alex. - Sean! - Sean! - Alex! [phone beeps] You need to get in the car. Sorry, who are you? If you want to make it through the night, get in the car now. - Thanks, we're fine. - No, you're not. - There are people looking for you. - Yeah, we know that. I'm not talking about police. Hey. You don't recognize me? I gave you a ride last night. They'll find her just like I did. I'm guessing you have a lot of questions about what's happening to you. I can give you some answers. But you need to trust me. Really nice of you. I think we're... Alex. Alex. This is a bad idea. Put this on. What is it? It's made of lead. Like at the dentist. Why? Protection. Protection from what? From her. I've seen this stuff on YouTube. It's all bullshit. You're right. Most of it is grainy home video of flying saucers, abduction stories. They're just distractions to throw in the six o'clock news to make sure that any real evidence will get lost in the noise. But it's hard to hide now. Everyone has a camera. So, you're saying those are like, - what, alien spaceships? - No, no, no, no. Not spaceships, just light. No mass to slow you down. The people who are looking for her are terrified because they have no idea what they're dealing with. And how could you possibly know that? Because I worked for them. They used to send me to clean up the mess. Change hospital records. Destroy evidence. Whatever I had to. Are there others like me? Yes. There were seven other close proximity centers. More? What happened to them? None of them survived more than six hours... until you. - I'm going to die? - No, you're not going to die. Look, she's fine. Show him what you can do. You get... you can do... you just... Alex. Alex. Hey. Every minute you're with her, you've been exposed to a kind of radiation. You need to get as far away as can you from her. I'm not leaving her, she needs my help. No, no, no, no. There is nothing more you can do. When your hair starts falling out and you're too weak to stand, you will wish you took my advice. Why here? Why not like Washington or Tokyo? Because we called it. In 1997, Chinese radio telescopes picked up a signal, thousands of years old. It was mathematical. Simple equations that create infinitely complex symbols like characters from a new language. Well, new to us. So, we built this. What does it do? Every night we project the symbols into the sky, hoping whoever sent it first is watching. We called and they answered. She's the proof. What? You were right. It's not just desert. So, what do we do? I know the protocols. I can buy you some time, so we can figure out the best way to go public with it. We will leave first thing in the morning. I think we should get some rest. The trailer next door is empty. You can sleep there. Sean? Oscar. Where are you? What the hell's going on? There's like a whole bunch of cops that are looking for you. Is it her? It's her, isn't it? She showed you? Yeah. See? I told you I wasn't lying. Yeah. You were right. How's grandma? She's great actually. When are you coming back? Soon. Like, when? Oscar. Oscar. I can't hear you. Sean? Hello? I... I can't hear you. - Sean? - Oscar. I love you. What? I said I love you. Just come home. You sure that's a good idea? Do you trust him? - Cal? - Yeah. I mean, I don't know. It's... It's a lot. It's kind of a crazy day. You're like part alien? It's not funny. No? That's what he says. Hell. You don't believe anything he said? I don't know. I don't know what I am. It's okay. I'm cool with it. Really? Where did you get this? You gave it to me. I wish I could remember more. You're lucky. There's so much I wish I could forget. Like what? Just like my mom leaving, my grandma getting sick right after, what happened between us. What? Nothing. - What is that? - It's... I think it's from when you pushed me out the window. I think your hand was there. Does it hurt? It's all right. I don't want to hurt you. I think we should get some rest. [vomiting] [radio chatter] Move, move, move! - [policeman] ...perimeter. - [man on radio] Copy that. No sign of break-in. Hello, Cal. I didn't expect to see you again. You didn't even say goodbye. Well, I see you stole some of our stuff. How did you find me? We assumed you'd try tracking it yourself. Anything? She stable? Twenty-eight hours. Incredible. She's different from the others, Kate. You need to see that for yourself. I plan to. We have her. She's on the move. Heading southwest on... They're just trying to connect with us. Take care of yourself, Cal. Alex! Alex. Sean, just let me get on the bus and get out of your life. I don't want you out of my life. Alex, I don't want you out of my life. Sean. You're sick and I'm making you sicker. - That's what Cal said. - No, Cal was wrong, okay? Cal was wrong. My grandma hasn't said a word in two years and then you show up and suddenly she's... she's speaking and she's normal. That's not some coincidence. You did that. That's crazy. - Yeah. - It's not true. Yeah, it's crazy. It is. Or maybe it's the first thing that makes any sense. Door's closing. One minute, please. Just give us one minute. You can get on that bus but I'm coming with you. You're going to get yourself killed. I'm not dead yet. Is there a problem? Everybody, stay in your seat, please. Don't let them take me. Just keep your head down. [clicking from Geiger counter intensifies] [screaming and shouting] - Get off! - [man] That's it, yeah. Don't hurt her! What are you doing to her? Alex! Alex! Leave her alone! Leave her alone! Alex! Alex! Let her go! Let her go! Alex! [radio chatter] [general chatter] What are you doing to her? We're trying to help her. I want to see her. Sean. I want to see her! The radiation that's been emitted has hurt a lot of people and it seems to be contained in Alex. You've had secondary exposure which has made you very sick. So, until we can get our hands around this, you can't get near her. I'm sorry. You've been given a localized paralytic agent to immobilize you from the neck down. It's for your own safety. Do you understand? Nice to meet you, Alex. We've been trying to establish contact with this phenomena for a long time. We're like children trying to say our first words. All the money and resources we've invested, it didn't matter. They chose your friend. We don't know if it was even intentional, but we believe they're using Alex as a way to communicate with us. What are they? That's a tough question to answer. Our technology has had little success getting information from them or it. We know that they're radiating in the full EM spectrum and that they're old. So old that they may have been there from the beginning. Beginning of what? The Big Bang. Creation, everything. [scientist] We want to know where they came from and why they're here. We think they've been attempting to integrate their consciousness with ours. You're seeing this? [scientist] Up until now those efforts have proved problematic. Our biology rejected them. Is she conscious? [scientist] People died. She's seeing something. Would you excuse me? She's going into cardiac arrest. We need to intubate. Let's go! [automatic voice] Warning: Radiation levels have exceeded safety limits. All right. Shut it down, now. Warning: Radiation levels have exceeded safety limits. Proceed to designated quarantine zones. Alex. [machine powering down] [flat line beep] Alex... Alex... Alex... [sighs] [deep breath] [scientist] Alex. Alex Lainey. Is this us? It's okay. Am I dead? That's good. Alex... Alex. Don't go. Just stay. Let her go. We're here. It'll get better now. Oh! Son of a... bag of tits. Shit! [helicopters] That was sick. Come on, let's go. Would have been sicker if I landed. You'll get it. You think they're going to watch you forever?
