I lost my partner eight years ago. It still feels like yesterday. I know what you think you saw. Starting trouble now would do a disservice to everybody. You have a nice afternoon. - Shh, shh, shh. I swear to God, if you're selling... - I'm not selling. - Don't lie to me. I'm not selling drugs. It's not what you think. So what should I think? I saw Big D get shot. So what did the police want with you? They wanted me to keep quiet. Hey, I got to get to work. She's running away, 'kay? But D didn't pull no gun out. Come here, baby. Come here. Come here. I want to go over to mommy. What should I do? You just got a new job. I'm about to graduate. Everything's gonna change if you just put this out there. Nothing has to change.

Now, Marisol is Manny's girlfriend, but she's the mother of their children, and I think her voice needs to be heard. Manny's bail was set at $100,000, and they should be out here arresting the real criminals. Yes! All he did was shoot a video! Ladies and gentlemen, I need you all to back up, please. And that video showed everything that happened. Yup. Yup. And they don't want anybody to see the truth. I am Darius Larson. I am Darius Larson. That's right. I'm Darius Larson. I am Darius Larson. Don't have to stand here. Just back up. Thank you. - I'm right here. - I don't steal from nobody. He ain't doing nothing wrong. - Step back. - My man, I'm right here, bro.

Why you putting your hands on me? Six dudes for one guy! Six dudes for one guy! Right now... Sorry. Stuck doing paperwork. Is everything all right? Yeah. Go back to sleep. Everything's fine. Remi's spelling bee was last night. How'd he do? He won silver. Remi. Remi? Come on, stink man. It's time to eat. You don't want no oatmeal, man? Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Sit. All right, all right. Sit. All right, eat your oatmeal. So I heard you won silver. I spelled "coalescence" wrong. Are you ready? We're gonna be late, Remi. Go get your bag. - Hey, what is that? - What's what? I don't want him wearing that. It's Parents Appreciation Day. I don't care what day it is. He's proud of you. All right, look, I'm... I'm sorry, all right? I just worry about him. Okay. I'll be home early, 'kay? - Mm. - Yes. Yes. - Okay. - Bye, man. - Bye. - Bye. Call you later. Yeah. Have a good day at school, all right? - Mm-hmm. - Can you open that? I'll open this. All right, bye, Daddy. So before me, did you ever have to draw your weapon on the job? Do you use shaving cream when you shave your balls? What? Jesus. I got a call from IAB last night. Yeah, me too. I don't know what they think they're gonna find. Got to start somewhere. You're not saying what I think you're saying. What? You know the job. Scala's no saint, but he's no different than any of us put in that situation. I saw the tape, all right? I saw the tape, and you know Scala. So what, you're gonna go blab to IAB about Scala? And then... and then what? What do you think they're gonna do? Maybe a slap on the wrist, give him a desk job? But you... they're gonna make an example out of you... Hey. Come have a beer. Scala's going on leave. - Uh... Oh, come on. You can stay for one round. Yeah, I got the wife, man. You know how it is. She's just judging you, right? Baby, don't let her judge you in our house. - No, please don't. - Oh. Does that mean we can finally call you Dr. Williams? - Do not jinx me. - And when is this? Couple weeks. Couple weeks. - Not yet. Not yet. - Yes. Baby, we don't have anything extraordinary to report. No, no, no, we got something. We got something. Did y'all know we just got a new cat? - That is right. - Congratulations. - Raise them up, Simba, please. - That's his name? - Simba. - His name is Simba? Like "The Lion King"? - Simba. "Everything the light touches." Yes, but officially, congratulations, salud. - Salud. - Cheers. - Can I get anyone dessert? - Mm. - Yeah? - That would be me. - 'Kay. - Thank you. "The Lion King." "Everything the light..." Hey, man... So what's happening about that Larson shooting? What do you mean? That poor man and his family. Yeah, it's a tragedy. Doesn't that affect you? It's one case out of hundreds. - All right, here we go. - Need help? Sorry. I didn't mean to get into it. Into what? Is it unfortunate what happened to Larson? Yes, it is. Unfortunate? Hey... What are we talking about? Larson was breaking the law. Selling cigarettes. That's pretty... I think he's playing devil's advocate. Well, this time Scala went too far, all right? He went too far, but again, we weren't there, and if he wasn't resisting arrest, he'd still be here. So if I resist arrest, you're gonna shoot me? Babe. Hey, come on. I mean, shouldn't there be some kind of training for that? Our training's just fine. The training's not the problem. So what do you think the problem is? One cop goes too far, and now we're all guilty? Is that what you're saying? - One cop? Larson is just this month's victim. - Well, what would you do? - What would I do? Yeah, Lisa, what would you do if somebody twice your size is coming at you? - He... - After several warnings. What would you do? - He was just standing there, if you remember. - You don't know that. You know how quickly these things escalate? What? He was surrounded by six or eight cops. - It takes seconds, Lisa. - He's dead. You have no idea. You don't have a clue what goes on on the streets. We see three minutes of a shaky video, and you think you know what you'd do. One cop's mistake, and now we're all to blame. You try taking a domestic violence call, have a gun pointed at your head. Then you come talk to me about training, hmm? I'm sorry. I just thought you were different. I thought maybe you were part of the solution. - Baby, let's go, okay? - I don't know. Thank you so much for dinner. Every time I put my vest on, Lisa, I have to consider the fact that I'll never see my family again. Wait. I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry. - Thank you. You remember our first date? I never wanted to marry a cop, but you... you put your hands on me, and you held me. Mm. And we made love. And the next morning I woke up... I saw your badge, and it was like, "Oh, my God. He's a cop." How come you didn't tell me?

They were brought to King's County Hospital, where they were soon pronounced deceased. In this time, we're all going to go through grief, pain, and anger, but we must remember that the one thing that we need more than anything is to support each other and to be there for the families of these two officers. Father Matthews has been kind enough to join us and will be in my office for anybody that needs to speak to him, as will I and any other supervisor in this building. As a family, we're hurting right now, guys, but we're gonna get through this. Let's take a moment and bow our heads. A reading from the book of Ecclesiastes 3:1-15. "There is an appointed time for everything, "a time for every event under heaven. "A time to be born, "and a time to die. "A time to plant, "and a time to uproot what is planted. "A time to kill, and a time to heal. A time to tear down..." You know, you don't have to worry about me, okay? What happened to Suarez and Gambini... what happened to them could have happened to anyone. I, um... I don't think that I can handle losing you. That's not gonna happen. Don't even say that. We can't let them scare us, Michelle. Fear's only going to get more people hurt. Can you turn it off for a second, please? - Turn what off? - This. This? This what? You are talking to me as if I'm someone who you pulled over for a parking ticket, okay? - You're stressed. - Yes. You're stressed. I understand. This job is not a choice. We always have choices, babe. Hello. Sherry Johnson. - Hi. - Hi. Thank you for taking the time to speak with us. We just have a couple of questions, and then we'll let you get on with your day. Anything I can do to help. Thank you for your cooperation. As this is a federal investigation, we're mandated to record your testimony. We can start with you telling us your name and your rank. Dennis Williams. I'm a police officer in the 74. But we hear you're up for promotion. Congratulations. What can you tell us about Officer Scala? Um, I didn't know him very well. We work opposite, uh, tours. But you graduated the academy together and then were both assigned to the 74 eight years ago. Is that correct? - That's correct. Can you describe for us what kind of officer you observed him to be? Um, well, we never patrolled together, so I really can't say, you know? You have a personal relationship with him? Ever, just even once, gone out for a casual drink, you know, after work? No. No. But were you aware that Officer Scala had several disciplinary cases open up against him prior to the Darius Larson shooting? I vaguely remember hearing something at some point. If there was wrongdoing or foul play, we'll get to the bottom of it. We're asking for your help in upholding the values of this department. I wasn't there. Because if a problem isn't rooted out, it could affect everyone... not just you, but all of the men and women in uniform and the civilians we're all fighting to protect and serve. - Right. - Right. So you could help us in demonstrating that Scala is unfit to be a police officer. His previous reports indicate that he used illegal force in several arrests. None of these cases were ever closed. Can you give us any information that could support these claims? I'm sorry. I didn't know Scala very well. Eight years. You must really know how to keep to yourself. Thank you. Thank you for your time. Listen... how do you say your name? - Zyric. - What's that? Zyric. Relax. We're just gonna ask you a couple of questions, okay? Where you coming from right now? - Practice. - What, basketball? - Baseball. - Baseball? What you got in the bag? - Books. - Now speak up, son. Books. All right, why don't you take your bag off? Let me take a look inside? What do you keep reaching for, anyway? What's in your pockets? - My phone. - Your phone? That's it? Yeah. You know what? Come over to the car. Just put your hands right there. Spread your legs. Are we good? Yeah, we're good. What'd you say your name was again? - Zyric. - Zyric. All right, grab your bag. You're good to go. All right, have a good night, all right? And get home safe. - Hey. - Hey. How was your day? Fine. All right. When they switched him in the lineup, it changed the whole dynamic of this team, and... Batting coach has been working with him on his swing, and he has improved. - Well, you know, I'm looking forward to what he does the rest of the year. Take that hat off in the house. Always acting like you rushing somewhere. Sit down and eat something. Good morning. Morning. You gonna mess my eggs up like that? Tastes better this way. You ready for the showcase this weekend? Mm-hmm. Look, I'm gonna tell you now. They gonna try to bust you in on the hands. You want to keep your weight back, extend your hands, let your hips do all the work. Get your bat out front, and drive the ball the other way. Don't try to pull it. Where you going? - Gonna be late. - Late? - Yeah. What time you supposed to be there? Hey! Keep it steady. Let's see it. Get your line. That's gone. Where's that one? That's it. That's it. Yeah. That's it. That's it. All right, here we go. Get your knees in. Wait for yours. Wait for yours, Z. There we go. Good eye. Wait for yours. Oh, my God. There we go. There we go. Take a seat... So, how you feeling? Good. All right, well, this weekend... the Nationals, the Mets, and the Diamondbacks are all coming to your showcase. You just play your game. Let me handle the rest. People are gonna try to get you to do all kinds of different things. There's gonna be money. There's gonna be girls... Yeah. And they'll try to get you to sign this and sign that. You just stay focused, 'cause there are a lot of guys who are waiting for you to mess up. All right, you tell your old man that Coach T says hello. - Yeah. I'll see him at the showcase this weekend. - Thanks, Coach. - All right, man. Get out of here. Leave the door open for me. You got ID on you? Darius Larson was known through the local community as Big D. Malik Waldon is a professor of sociology from New York University who explores racial identities in his new book, "Stop Killing Us Now." On June 1st, Larson, who was shot and killed by NYPD Officer Scala just outside of a deli in Bedford-Stuyvesant for allegedly selling illegal... Sir, could you step back, please? Back. All right, sir, just step back, please. You don't have to stand there. Just back up. Thank you. - I'm right here. - All right, sir. Please. He ain't doing nothing wrong. - Step back. - My man, I'm right here, bro. Sir, just film it over there. I'ma film it right here. I'm walking home anyway. - Put your hands... - Back the fuck up! Don't touch me, son! Don't touch me! Yo, yo, D, I got this! Why you putting your hands on me? Six dudes on one guy! Six dudes on one guy! Right now! Get in the fucking car! Are you serious right now? Shit... Hey, come out to the community center. - Hey, Zoe. - Hey. - Got a minute? - What's up? Can we get some food? - Sure. - Cool. - So. - So. You're the one buying me pizza. Yeah. I, um... I don't know. I just... I never knew him, you know what I mean? I knew of him. Everybody did. But I just feel like I can't walk by the W anymore, you know? I feel like everywhere I go, I'm reminded of what happened. So... I don't know. I just feel like dude used to give a dollar at least once to everybody, you know? I'm sure he cut me a ice cream once or twice. Maybe I'm tripping, but... I want to get involved, do what you do. And what is it that you think I do? I'm saying get involved. "Get involved." You can't just turn on a switch. It's a full-time job, just like you have a full-time job to do. You can't just show up to practice whenever you feel like it, right? I'm saying, can't I do something? I'm serious. Okay. Okay? Now what? Now eat. I'm fucking sick of being nice, nigga. These motherfuckers got the legal right to take our lives, and y'all want to walk around with fucking sticks and t-shirts. Nah, this shit ain't fucking... What you gonna do? I don't fucking know, a'ight? Shit, why you always coming at me? What, you think breaking windows and stealing something is the answer? Look, we're just taking back what they already stole from us, right? Exactly. Shit don't make you fucking angry? You always got something to prove? Somebody got to light shit up. Wouldn't be no Martin without Malcolm. - Facts. - You feel me? Fact, straight up and down. Look, Zyric, our staff has seen quite a bit of you, and we really like you, which is why I'm sitting here with you today. You have a very unique skill set, but you're raw, so, for us it's an investment. And we need to know if you are willing to invest in yourself. Oh, he's ready to work, Mr. Durst. Well, what I'm looking for specifically is, well, talent, of course, and character. Oh, don't worry about that. He was raised right, sir. With all due respect, Mr. Norris, I'd like to hear from you, Zyric. You got a girl here? - No, sir. - Friends? - Yes, sir. - Good. Friends are good. What are they doing tonight? Sir? What do you normally do? You guys smoke weed? Drink? It's okay, son. Come on. No, no. Um, no. You can tell me. Trust me. I'm the guy that's gonna go to bat for you for this organization, and I believe 100% you're gonna go in the first round. So anything you think I might need to know so there's no surprises down the road, you let me know. I... I don't know. I usually just keep my head down and focus on the game in front of me. Nothing wrong with that. Shows maturity. A lot of kids your age aren't mentally ready for the job, and they will throw away their future... For a little fun. So we'll see you again, then, at the showcase, right? Oh, yeah. Thank you so much for letting me into your home, Mr. Norris. Thanks for coming, sir. All my pleasure. Zyric, it was a real pleasure to finally do this in person. - Yeah. We'll see you at the showcase. I'll show you out... Oh, Z! Yeah, man. Oh, my boy! Yes, I'm so proud of you. Oh, you know you didn't have to. Mari, this is Z. Z, Mari. I know the face. I always see you wearing those pants. Emmy! How you been? Just nauseous, nauseous, nauseous. Baby's doing good though? Yeah, it's cooking. Slowly cooking in there. Manny always wanted a boy so he can teach him how to catch. He was so upset when I told him it was girl. Ooh, the shapes. But when we brought her home, everything changed. I can't even imagine how hard this must be for you. Z, can you go watch Emmy for a minute? Yeah. Yeah, sure. Hey, you want to go play? Come on. - What's this? - I made a paper airplane. Oh, man. Emmy, look how cool this is. My daddy gave it to me. Oh. One, two, three. Oh! Looks like you got yourself a new babysitter. Thanks for showing me the way, okay? Dude, a police officer tells you to stop, you fucking stop. I'd be scared as shit. I'm not gonna argue and say don't touch me. The guy's a criminal. Yo, if I'd been one of those cops, I'd have put ten bullets in him. I'm serious. You reach for my gun, I'm putting a clip in your ass. Pow, pow, pow! - "Oh, I'm innocent." Yo, what did he expect? You reach for a police officer's gun, you're gonna get shot. - That's it. Yeah, for what? You won't get shot. Hey. Hey, baby, how you doing? Mm, I'm so proud of you. - I didn't do anything. We just thanking God for all our blessings and all your successes. We counting on you, baby. Just keep on making your grandma proud. There goes my future Hall of Famer nephew right there. Hey, Bobby, let's hope he gets on a real team, all right? You playing for the Yankees or the Mets? I just want a seat behind home plate with your old man. Any team. Any team, right? You open that. Those C-notes ought to keep you going till your contract is complete, okay? 'Cause I know your father doesn't like you to work during the season. Put it away, and when you come back, we'll talk about that endorsement deal your father keeps bragging about. Yeah, I'm bragging. Hey, Zyric, when you gonna get your old man that swimming pool... Hey, Z, open up. Come on out. The party's for you, son. I'll be out in a minute. Hey, Zyric. Where you think you're going? I'm... I'm going downtown. Downtown? I mean, can't you see what's happening out there? And you want to do what, exactly? - I thought you'd, um... - Thought I'd what? I thought you'd understand. This happens every day, man. You better start listening to what's going on around you. Pop, I am listening. Z. I mean, you got a hoodie on, for Christ's sake. Come on, Z. You're going out at night to some damn march on the night before the biggest day of your life, son. Work with me, man. Cities are gonna keep burning. Kids are gonna keep getting shot, and cops are gonna keep getting off. And I don't like that neither, son, but I know it's a reality, all right? But my reality right now is that you have a ticket out. Z. Z! I am! Darius Larson! - I am! - Darius Larson! I hereby declare this to be an unlawful assembly.
