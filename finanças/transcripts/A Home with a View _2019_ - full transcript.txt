OK, it's time for the money-saving report. You go first, Dad. I've been eating this stale bread for a whole week, and have saved $100. Amazing! You've won a piece of bean-curd for later. -Great. -Amazing? I've eaten stale bread for three years and have become a skeleton, aren't I amazing? Your turn, Sze. I made cleansers with cucumbers and face masks with tomatoes. I saved $500 on cosmetics. Wow! $500. No! That doesn't count. She wasted our food. All my classmates use Dior or Chanel, but not me. Not even Photoshop can help my face. Get lost. -OK, you've saved $500. Don't get upset. -Dad. All right, $500. What about Hong? I didn't buy a new iPhone, and so saved $9,000. Good. You really can't count that. It's the same as if I saw a Mercedes and decided not to buy it. Does that mean I saved a million dollars? It doesn't make sense, right? It doesn't. I don't even use a mobile. Shut up, old fart. That's Grandpa! My phone is older than all my friends' phones, Dad. All right, I'll put down $1,000 for you. Good! $1,000. -Out of my way. -Honey? My friends went to Thailand together for five days. I didn't show up, so I saved $4,500. -Very good. -Wow, $4,500 for my wife. I feel sorry for you, Mom. But Mom, it's Thailand, it wasn't so bad. One guy wanted to go to Macau for just three days, but his dad said no! I feel more sorry for him, Mom. More sorry? You should feel more sorry for your Mom. You were born when I was only 19, and then came your baby sister. Not long after that, I lost my job and became a housewife. Soon your Dad got a mortgage on this flat. Now tell me, who's more to be pitied, eh? A happy family needs a happy home of its own. A flat! We'll be OK in a couple of years. A couple more years? A couple of years? I can't wait that long for puberty, Dad. I'm already two inches behind. Don't worry. Your brother will get a job in two years. He'll buy you a pair of high-heels. You'll catch up on the two inches then. I meant my boobs, not my height, Dad. Pity me. Is two inches on boobs so...? Of course. Hey! It's the die-hard smoker again. My allergy is coming back. Damn... smoking when we're eating--! Shut up. It's too noisy up there. I'll give you a punch. The smoke will going away... soon...very soon. It's my turn now. I didn't save any money. But, I've made some. I tripled my income this month. So the expenses are OK this month. Wow! Great. You're great, Dad. We've been paying off the mortgage for 15 years. 20 more years to go. Twenty years... I told you not to bring that up, Wai Man. Fuck you, I'm poking you back! Poke! Take that! Are you nuts? If you poke a hole in the ceiling, it's gonna costs me money to fix it. Turn the TV up. We won't hear the chop, chop, chop then. No! This is a fighting scene. This will give me cramp. Oh, man. This must not happen again. Today is the last day. You must move out. Sorry! My husband is coming back in two days. I'll pay you as soon as I get the money. What did she say? Why don't you open the door first? He's always like that. Hey! Butcher. Open up, butcher. A few more minutes. He said he heard you, he just needs a few more minutes. After that, no more noise. We should go back to our dinner. No way. We must sort this out tonight. He does that every night! Open the door, butcher. What now? What do you want? Hey! Don't you know that there's also bean-curd, veggies, eggs, and fish? You don't have to stick to your pork pie. Don't you know I only sell pork, and I only have pork? OK. Well, it would be OK if we cooked dinner at the same time. But I was already enjoying my dinner, while you keep chopping up here! How to enjoy my dinner? I was thinking about the same thing. How can I best enjoy my pork at home, when I don't sell it all at work? Don't forget you have a meat grinder at work. Chopping pork by myself is much better than the grinder, man. Don't you know there are recipes for sliced pork or spare ribs too? Steamed, deep fried, barbecued, stewed... It doesn't have to be chopped pork pie! Don't you know there are many flats out there? You don't have to live under mine! Hubby. Did you hear him? He's not making any sense. You don't know manners. I don't blame you. But please learn to respect your neighbors. You're speaking for yourself. You should learn from your hubby. See how nice he is? He came along with you, but is very quiet. Stupid. Hey. I haven't finished talking yet. Why would I care? I want my dinner. He has one minute. I'll call the Environmental Protection Department if he hasn't stopped. -OK. -OK, one minute. Let's go home and eat first. One minute. -Stop chopping! -I like steamed pork pie. Pork pie is all I like. He's always like that. What's wrong, little guy? -Go away! -My Mom wants to kill herself, please stop her. We'll all die together today. Hubby. Don't! What's going on here? We came to do our job. We should have finished work by now. Our boss sent us to evict them. We're just carrying out orders. We'll be fired if we don't do this. We'll die too. If you evict me, I'll die anyway. -Even if I die, I'd... -Don't. Don't die. What will happen to your son if you die? Little guy, c'mon quick. Mom... I am scared. Is there another way to do this? We all work hard to stay alive. Right? We're much better than many loan sharks. We don't do dirty things. We have to do this no matter what. She hasn't paid her mortgage for three months. How about you pay for one month? We'd have something in hand at least. -How much would that be? -Honey. Look, we didn't buy any home insurance. What if they set a fire and our place gets burned down too? We would lose more money, got it? -So, how much? -$9,000. $9,000. If this flat is condemned, the price of ours will drop, too. Three by three is nine. Thank you. It's OK, Mrs. Chiu. It's all right now, go make some dinner. Honey. Stop where you are. Get out, don't come back. -Why? -I want a divorce. What's wrong? "What's wrong," you ask? I canceled my trip and betrayed my friends to save $4,500. And you? $9,000, and you just gave it away like that! I didn't give it away. I will ask Mr. Chiu for it when he's back. I don't care. Also, I'm your wife and I didn't know you carried so much cash! I meant to tell you, and I'm telling you now. It's $10,000...No...$15,000. -That's $6,000 -Dad. -Because I just got... -Dad. What? Brother's Hi-Fi is too loud, it's driving me nuts. And he's smoking. Turn it down. Why are you learning to smoke? If I have to breathe in smoke, I might as well smoke my own cigarettes first-hand! Also, I turned my Hi-Fi on because I want to blend with my music. I'm prepping for my interview tomorrow, get lost! My math test is coming up too! I don't want to be a repeater like you! Spare him for just one day, for his interview, OK? Come on, use the headphones. It's all right. His smoke stinks. Hey. -Hey. Where are you going? -Where am I going? -On a trip. -Are you out of your mind? Am I? You're paying for it. -Don't be stupid. -Look what I shat out. The pills got pooped out one by one with capsules. Look. Poppa! How many times have I told you not to look at those pills? Dad, we'll save a lot on our electricity bill if we turn off the TV and the Hi-Fi. Yeah! Turn those lights off. Put a candle here, a perfect match for my new song. OK, turn it off! I'm closing my books, OK? Let's be first-hand smokers together, say no to second-hand smoke. -I know, I can't give you that. -I'm going to take some medicine. You don't have any cramps. A little cramp is OK. I'm cramping up now. How come I can never make your dad understand, hubby? Why don't you tell him? Hubby? Don't be so loud. Oh, cramp, my son! Only by looking out this window are we able to feel a little relieved, and leave the noise behind. Temporarily. Do you know, the population of Hong Kong reached 7.3 million in 2018. The average living space is 161 square feet per person, which means about 204,000 families' living space is less than 215 square feet. My name is Wai Man Lo. I'm pretty well established in this city. Because I'm married, have a beautiful wife, and two very adorable kids. Most importantly, we own a flat with a sea view. And we are a happy family, envied by many people. However, my kids are growing bigger, and our place becomes smaller every day. More new condos are being built out there, blocking more and more of the sea view, creating more and more problems for us to deal with. -Going to work. -Hubby. Your breakfast is here. Lunch is last night's left-overs. OK? And I've just fixed your shoes. Don't walk too hard in them, OK? I know, I'm running late, honey. -Be careful. -I'm meeting someone. See you. Old fart. That's Grandpa! Grandpa. If you turn off the fan in the morning again, I swear I'll smash it to pieces! Then no one will enjoy it. It's really cold in the morning though. You aren't my type, Ken. Don't come for me anymore. Hey, Yu Sze. Don't spend so much time falling in love. You're young. Exactly, I am. I want to experience every kind of love before marriage. First love. Madly in love. Heart-break. One-sided. Secret. Long distance. A love triangle. Love with pain. Age gap. Then I must move on, back to a normal life. It'll probably take 1.5 years each time, meaning I can't get married until I'm 35. There's no way you can experience all that in your lifetime. But it's possible online. That's why I have to prepare myself for the break-ups. -What break-ups? -Nothing. I'll pick you up from school today. No. My classmates will think I'm pregnant. -Take your pills, Poppa. -Thank you. Have you got everything? Yes. Go. OK, eat. Remember what grandpa told you? -Everything he said is correct, OK? -OK-- What is your problem? Haven't you got any social ethics? Are you OK? -Yes. -Go. Some people are really unbelievable these days I'm telling you, you can go out with your dates, but don't jump into bed with them. You're living in the last century, Mom. You've forgotten where you are. Jumping into bed with them is nothing, what matters is breaking-up cautiously. Do you know nowadays couples... All I know is you're gonna be late. The van is there, hurry. Bye! Go wash the bedding. Be careful. See. No bags, no sacks, no trouble walking through. Not even cigarette butts. It's good for you to walk up the stairs with me. You get to learn about this passage, right? Fire escapes are very important. There is a warehouse, right next door. Very few people come to work, so it's very quiet. This way. Old factory buildings like this often have high ceilings. One doesn't feel closed in. This corridor is designed in the Continental European style. Hello. It's pretty exciting here. You'll get used to it. Every room is given a number, 902D. How are you, Mrs. Wong? Mrs. Wong can finish the clean-up this afternoon. Come in and take a look. OK. It's very comfy, living here. No windows, no views. How comfy can it be? Windows and views only come with private flats, madam. This is 180 square feet. It'd cost you 8 million for a flat of this size. You'd pay $20,000-plus per month. You can't compare it to this. But is there a kitchen or bathroom? Yes, there is. There's a public toilet around the corner. A real big one. Yes! But everyone lines up to use it every morning. Not me. We do have rooms with private toilets. They cost more. It's an additional $1,500 for a toilet. You can make it your other choice. -Hey, Mr. Lo. -Yes? My private toilet has been blocked for a month. You never got it fixed for me. How can I sleep in a pool of shit every night? I notified the department already. It'll be taken care of very soon. It should be OK, the shit is from yourself. The toilet won't get blocked if you eat less and poop less. Sorry. As for the kitchen, it all depends on how you see it. This is an industrial neighborhood. Restaurants are open 24 hours for take-out. If you want privacy, get yourself a portable electric cooker. You and your wife can have romantic and tender loving time together. Fire is no problem either. Someone will collect your bodies in a couple days is all. Didn't I put out the burning newspaper for you last time? I didn't call the police because I wanted to make sure that the tenants could continue living here. Oh yes, on our behalf. People fight and kill each other here every day, yet we never report it. Killing each other? No, we can't spread the word around about this place. We can't advertise. We don't bother the police simply because we want to offer another choice to potential tenants like you. Wait, we haven't decided yet. -We'll think about it. -Let's go. Why don't you guys think about why these people keep complaining, yet they still live here? Because the rent is low. I know you two have just got married, and the money is tight. Later on when your baby is born, money will be very important and you will need to keep everything low-cost, right? Give me some spring onions $1.50. I need some to steam my fish. I don't mind giving you some if you buy the flowering cabbage at $18 a kati. But you only bought the potatoes for $8. Why don't you be the boss here? I would be a better boss than you. I bought potatoes here because they're the cheapest. All the other veggies are the most expensive in this area. My veggies are good. Don't buy any if you can't afford them. Crazy woman. Hello? Call back later to sell your-- The guidance counselor? Yes... You are here because we have to inform you that a student gave birth in a toilet. The police have dealt with it already. Don't worry, it was a smooth birth, so both the mother and the baby are OK. It's a boy. What does all this have to do with my daughter? She was the midwife, and will get a demerit. -A demerit? -Yes. Did you deliver the baby? The mother and the baby are doing fine? Helping people is a good deed, Madam. She should be given a merit instead. It's because she seriously violated the school rules by delivering the baby during class hours. That's why she's getting a demerit. That makes sense. Why did you skip class to do it? Why didn't you get the baby's father? Nobody knows who the father is. That's right. So, she has done a good deed and should be given a merit, Madam. No point in pleading for her. A demerit is a must. No, Madam. She... Madam, as a matter of fact, I think the teachers in this school should be held accountable, too. Why did no teacher notice -that this student was pregnant? -Don't you have any common sense? It was a premature birth. How could we tell? Don't blame our school for everything. -I lack common sense? -Correct. I gave birth to two children, how can I not? I don't think you do though. -Don't I? -No, you don't. -A first-level demerit for her! -A merit. -A demerit. -Well, let's go and complain then. To whom? -The Education Bureau. -Hey. In fact, you're invited here today because we want to make you a special offer. -A 50% discount: a second-level demerit. -Merit. -A second-level demerit. -Let's call the Bureau. -OK. -Hey! Our school never wants to trouble parents. At the same time, neither do we want parents to trouble us. Therefore, no demerit or merit is to be cited. -Satisfied? -I'm not. Why not? I forgot to take a selfie with the baby in the toilet. Well, that's quite sad indeed. It's good that you learned the skill. Someday, when some guy gets you pregnant, and you aren't sure who he is, and we can't afford an abortion, you can deliver your own baby. Shut up. Pulling the baby out with your bare hands isn't enough. You need hot water to clean the baby too. That's how my grandma did it, she pulled me out and put me in water. OK! I don't need to know any more of this. I won't do it again. Here, have an orange. You had a hard day today. Get some Vitamin C. Thanks, Dad. You not only wanted to take a selfie with the baby, you wanted to give him a name, too. You'd feel great about that, that's how you are. I have nothing to do with the baby's name. But I do want to give myself one. We gave you your name. You have no right to change it. Different apps use different names, Dad. Stop fooling around with those apps then. You are not to change your name no matter what. I don't care. Tomorrow, I'll start calling myself Ting Sheng. And I will never have a baby before marriage. Please get married as soon as you can. After that you'll move out and get lost. So I'll have another room. If you want a room of your own, you must first find yourself a job paying $30,000. Then buy a flat, and pay the mortgage. I have been looking for a job. $30,000? Those who get the jobs that pay $10,000-plus either have big boobs, or their parents are the bosses I don't have big boobs, and you two don't own a company. It's your Mom's fault. She spoiled you, and supported you so you could study music at university. Such an unpopular subject. There's only one Michael Jackson or Justin Bieber. -I'm going out. -Look at you... Honey. Yes? Where are you going? KTV! It's Qinger's twentieth anniversary. It's so sheer. Why are you wearing this for somebody else's anniversary? Look! I can see both of your arms. Your flabby arms. I meant to buy this dress for our anniversary. Do you know why I wasn't able to? Mom, Dad, brother went into my room I'm just trying to help our family. I'm thinking of how to rent this corner to my school-friend as storage space. You have your own room for rent. -What now? -Insane. There's a gigantic piece of trash in my room I don't care! Jesus. Use your room wisely, to make money. Get rid of toys readily! -Stop arguing. -Make room for a naked body! -Hong, stop calling your grandpa trash! -This is too much! -You come out wicked, I go naked. -Are you listening? -This is really pissing me off. -You're welcome. We're just helping each other out. A subdivided flat shouldn't be a problem. Some must be available. I'll send you the info from work tomorrow. Thank you, Mrs. Chiu. Which Mrs. Chiu? The one next door. How come she has your WeChat number, and I don't. She wanted to pay me back, but didn't want to go to the bank to do it. So, she transferred it to my WeChat account. What subdivided flat? Are you keeping her as a mistress? Being Chiu's mistress isn't enough? She's coming to get you, too? I'm going over to get her. Stop fooling around. What are you doing? This is embarrassing. Why would you...? Do you think women are attracted to a man like me? I want a divorce. I want a flat of my own. I don't understand your logic. I'm a piece of trash, but not for long I don't care! Either a divorce, or this flat is mine. You co-own this flat, and always have. Our next flat will be in your name only. When we pay off this one, the next one will be yours. Pay off? You jerk! 20 more years! I won't own a flat until I turn 60! I have to put up with this chopping for 20 more years! -When we are 60, we'll hear nothing. -I've got to kill him today. When you're 60, your ears can't hear, and your eyes can't see. Look at my father... What are you doing, Dad? Sit down first. I'll scream for help if you dare to take one more step. For who? The police? I'll get you anything you need. Are you crazy? What are you carrying a chopper for? To kill him, or to scare him. Don't act like that, it's embarrassing. Relax. Look out the window. -What happened? -What? What is that? BUY ONE GET ONE FREE! GOOD TASTE! EVERY CLASSIC MOMENT! Poppa, quick. Are you all right, Poppa? Grandpa. That's unbelievable. It's here, hubby. Anytime. Hello. Sorry to bother you. Talk to you later. -Oh, yes! I'd like to know... -What do you want? There's a billboard on the rooftop. -A billboard on your rooftop. -What billboard? I know nothing about it. You'll see it if you go up there with us. Up? Up where? Go up to see it yourself, things like that aren't legal I'm on duty. You go up first. It's so big. What do you want? Is that big billboard yours? Is it? He didn't answer, hubby. May we go in to take a look? Are you the police? I don't know you people. You want to look at my place. How about I go and look at your place? Something is wrong, hubby. How about we go down together to take a look? It's really here on the rooftop. C'mon, let's go down to take a look. That's it! Is that huge billboard yours? That is an illegal structure. It'd be disastrous -if it fell and crushed someone. -Yeah. How about I give you one week to get rid of it. We'll pretend it never existed. What do you think? Don't tell me you want to leave it there for two months? We won't tolerate that. -It's blocking our sea view. -Damn right. Beautiful? How did you get it connected so easily? Is he making fun of us, hubby? You're gonna be late for work if you don't start eating now, hubby I asked for the afternoon off, to find out the laws about illegal structures. Will your salary or bonus be deducted then? I don't care. You know this window means a lot to us. Our family fights over everything 10 or 20 times a month at least. It's thanks to this window that all our stress gets taken away. Hang in there, Dad. OK. Work hard in school, Yu Sze. Call me Ting Sheng. Where can I get a number, please? Thanks. Put down the name or info of the person or company you want to complain about in the jurisdiction. I don't know the person's name. We... live opposite to each other in two different condos. I can't help you unless you fill out the form. We won't be able to follow your case unless you fill out the form. Sorry, sir. We have many complaint cases to look after. You'll have to wait your turn. Go and collect the required info and bring it here next month on the 15th. Excuse me, I have a complaint. Get a number and wait over there. -San Po Kong? -Number 216, please go to the counter. I'll call you back later, OK? -Sorry... 216. -Number 216, please go to the counter. Any evidence from the third parties? What is that? That is, other than yourself, can anybody else or your neighbor prove this matter is affecting your life? Hello, Cheung? Yes! This is Wai Man. Lo Wai Man. Yes! Long time no see. Yes! How have you been keeping? Are you still working in the government? That's great. Something has happened to me, I wonder if you could help me with it? Hello, Suk Yin. What is it? Who is it, honey? Sorry, Cheung. Hi. Sorry. Haven't seen you for ages. I need you to help me solve a problem. Come over and take a look. C'mon, over there. Look! It's a disaster. Sorry about this. Our place is a little run-down. Be careful. Look. What a huge billboard. That's what's blocking our sea view. A few days ago, we could still see the sea through the gap. We'd tell the sea our troubles. Now, it's like our lives have come to an end. Nothing has gone right at home. Sadly, happy families often have good luck while miserable families have bad luck. Have you found out if the tenant had approval to put that up? Yes, the condo's superintendent said the management office hadn't been told of it. Well then, it's 100% an illegal structure. Have some tea. All right. Thank you I'll get you some pastry. Lucky you, Suk Yin. So is your wife. Drink some tea. No, thank you. Drink some. Do you think you can help us to get rid of that billboard? The fact is, I'm with the Civil Affairs Department. This department is responsible for education and arts promotion. So... Wai Man got things screwed up. He thought you could help us. He wasn't wrong though. If you need my help, I'll do my best. Well, could you talk to your old-time colleagues in the Housing Department then? No. The Housing Department is for public housing estates, -not for knocking down buildings. -The police? Nope! They might not want to get involved. The Buildings Department might be able to help. Could you call the department for us? I can't. Cross-departmental communication is very troublesome. Is that so? If there's nothing you can do, why didn't you just say so on the phone? You didn't have to make a trip here. Let's leave right now. Peanuts. Want some? When we get back. Let's go. Mr. Wong. Do you live here, Mr. Wong? Cheung is my last name. The thing is, the government is now fighting very hard against illegal structures. Any cases, big or small, we'll get them done quickly. So the longer you take to get it down, the higher the penalty will be. The best way to handle this is to take it down yourself as soon as you can. If you want the government to do the job for you, the fee will be very high. Also, the government will not compensate you for any damage. Therefore if you take it down yourself, we'd consider it a negotiated settlement and you wouldn't be taken to court. Understood. That's good. But, aren't I supposed to receive a letter from the department concerned before I think of what to do? Yes! Generally speaking, you should receive a letter first before anything is done. But if you don't fix the problem yourself before the letter arrives, it's gonna be difficult. One possible situation is that there might be a fist fight, or you might hear a lot of foul words. What? Sorry, say that again? A fist fight? And trespassing on private property? C'mon. Go ahead, do it! We're not afraid. Take it down right now, asshole. Take it down! Is this how you do it? -Yes. -Actually, what department are you from? The Civil Affairs Department. But that isn't where I came from today. I came representing Ms. Suk Yin Lo-Lee. -That means you're not from the EPD. -No. -Nor the Bureau of Commerce and Industry. -No. Well, I'm very sorry then. You can't charge me for having an illegal structure, or even an unapproved construction. Let me introduce this to you. This is an art work, -not a billboard. -Oh? This is an artwork built in my own home. What? But I need a little more time to finish it. A good piece of art surely requires a signature. I don't mind any of you admiring my work at your convenience. Whether while you're here, or from your place. But I charge $10 here. Art work has value, you know. Take your time, it's free of charge today. Shall I get you people something to drink? I even showed you the deed of mutual covenant. I don't know anything. -Sorry to have bothered you. -What are we gonna do? I've never handled something like that before. OK, how about you ask Wai Man to be patient. I'll find out more about it at work. Ask Wai Man to call up other departments as well. To check it out. It's getting late, I have to go home. Take care. So? Does the deed mention anything? Is there anything we can do? Anything written down? Hold it, old fart. Keep an eye on him for me. I'm going out to get something done. OK? Watch him. -Where are you going? -To earn money. You better mean what you say. Come back early. Watch him for me. Any pee, poop, vandalism, tell me. -I'll sue him till the day he dies. -Thank you. It's the first time you haven't treated me like trash. -Yes? -Ready? -For what? -For the hospital, of course. -Why hospital? -To see a doctor, of course. -Who wants to see a doctor? -Your husband. Why would he want a doctor? Why would her husband want a doctor? Let me check. Terminal liver cancer, and depression. Crazy. Crazy? It isn't stated here I said you people are crazy. Who do you want? Tai Hung Chan. One floor down. One floor down? Aren't we on the fifth floor? Come, look. The number is 5, but it's the sixth floor. Improve your Chinese. Improve your Chinese. Just follow the stink of cigarettes, you can't miss it. Sorry about that. Nutcase. What now? Bitch. -What are you doing? -Did you get her? Don't bother, strip her. What? Why did you do that? My husband has no money, and isn't handsome. -Why did you hit on him? -Me? Hit on your husband? What are you crazy people talking about? Deny it all you can. You still want to see him, right? That jerk confessed it all to me. You live in Flat C, right? This is Flat D, bitch. Won't you stop that? Oh, this is Flat D. Sorry. That's all? You hit me several times. OK now? Delete it. Now. Don't delete the part where I smacked myself, in case she holds me accountable I'd like to ask, which way is Flat C? -Across the hallway. -That's good. Let's move on. This way. Go. Crazy people. The result is very good. The meeting in the afternoon is ready. Yes! See you I'm home. Sze? Hong? Look, honey! Pineapple buns with butter. For high tea. I asked for half a day off. I need to go to different government departments again. Freeze. What's wrong? Hey. Don't do that! We aren't home alone. Somebody might see us. I'll lose control of myself. Lose control of yourself? What will you do then? I will... Why don't you tell me? What do want from me? I'll tell you if you give me your mobile. No! OK, I know now. I know what you want from me. No. No secret affair, no mistress, nothing. Stop thinking nonsense. What soap operas have you watched lately? This is what housewife syndrome means. Do you have nothing else to worry about? Go find some work to keep yourself busy. Housework always keeps me busy. Do you think I want to behave like this? Everybody is crazy here! Every one of them. I'm going crazy, too. I want to open the window, get some fresh air, and have a cup of tea. I can't do that now. How can I not be upset? It's far too much noise. Do you want me to find a man and sleep at his place? Please do, hurry. Go! Hurry. You want to be left... What doctor? I'm not ill. Go see a doctor if you're unwell. Don't be like that! Don't listen to him. Lift him! Take him away. You send me away at your own risk. -Hubby. -Lift him! Take him away. Take him away! Quick. Hello. Nice working with you. The director wants to get the cast of characters fixed first. He studied your music work, and finds the melody a little odd. OK, next time then. Sure, no problem. If you ever need this or any other type of music, you know where to find me. Yes! I will. OK, bye. Fuck! The bus fare cost me an arm and a leg. Why didn't you just WeChat me to tell me? I'll write a song to damn you to hell. -Bye, Ling. -Bye. Choi. I can't believe you became your own boss overnight. What a nice surprise. All because you people made me redundant and I couldn't find another employer. Thank you for your support. You're welcome. How did you think of such a low-cost ad idea? Good for you. Because I am poor and can't afford a flat. I didn't think of it before I lived on a roof. You know, renting a billboard on a rooftop costs us 10 times more than you renting a room up there. What are you doing? No photo-taking here. I want a selfie. -A selfie? -Yes. Don't lie. I'll create 10 billboards 10 times bigger than that within a year. Your check is ready. Won't you treat us to dinner? Of course I will. I'll go get our old-time colleagues. And your family, how about that? My family too? Can he afford it? I went to a lot of departments, they said if I want to establish a case, I have to prove to them the billboard involves a business activity. Then residents of the condo building can come together to sue the billboard owner. I don't know nothing, and can help you with nothing. All you do is take a photo to give me. Why don't you do it yourself? I have to work. You work here every day. If you see any stranger coming to visit that bastard and his billboard, take a photo, and I'll take it from there. Don't bug me with this. Maybe the billboard will change from advertising beer to lingerie later on. Then your family will hate to see it go. My family only wants the sea view back. I really can't help you with that. Thank you. Let me buy you a meal someday. Dad... What happened? What happened? Say something. No... What do you want? You either call the police, or go home to sleep I really have nothing to say to you. I didn't come to complain about you. I just want to tell you about this huge billboard cross the street which is blocking our view, and ruining our benefits. So I hope to get everybody together and lodge a petition against it. C'mon, sign your name here. Sign my name? I can see the sea from my window, but I have no time for it. Stupid woman. No. Go home to sleep. Please sign your name here, madam. It's about this illegal roof structure. I didn't order a take-out. -I'll explain it again. This illegal... -I didn't order any take-out. Not a take-out, listen to me. Can anyone read? I told you I didn't order any take-out. No... I'm just a tenant. Talk to the landlord. It doesn't matter, as long as you support us. -Go get the landlord to sign it. -But you are the one who lives here. -Just sign. -Let me talk to the landlord. No need, just sign it. You're so pretty! Pretty and kind. C'mon, sign here. Just sign your name I only came for two days. Hurry up! Shower first. Sorry. Done! More than I expected. Shall we go up there together? I've already talked to a couple of friends about that. My colleagues will find it inappropriate if they see me with you. But I'm worried that I might screw it up and have to start from scratch again. Why don't you practice it in order first? Commerce, Industry and Tourism Branch, and Environmental Protection, it doesn't matter which I do first, but I must get both stamps before taking it to the Buildings Department. You have a pretty good memory. No wonder Suk Yin left me for you. Goodbye. Keep trying. Grandpa, you can do it. Hang on. Great. Your performance has to be worse than that during your check-up tomorrow, old fart. My legs are already bad enough. You can only claim $1,800 insurance for your legs. But if your numb legs cause urinary incontinence, you can claim $6,800. I don't want urinary incontinence. We might need to pay a legal fee for the lawsuit, grandpa. We're short of money. Please help us. I don't know how to tell lies. No, no lies. We want to see real urinary incontinence during your check-up. How can I pee in front of a stranger? That's why you must practice now. One more bottle. -Drink slowly. -I've already had many bottles. What are you guys doing? They're forcing me to drink a lot of water, so that I'll pee involuntarily. We'll claim the insurance tomorrow. What if starting tomorrow, he pees involuntarily every day? Who will help mop the floors? Stop drinking. She will. She suggested it. Done. It's finally done. Our case has finally been taken care of. Great. You're a hero, hubby. Sorry, I can't hold it any longer. This is it, the illegal billboard. Irrefutable evidence. The rooftop is his too, you can ask him. -Leave. -Mr. Wong I'm from the EPD. We don't want to waste government resources. We don't want to take the problem to court. We hope to settle it here, OK? He collects fee too. Is he going to pay for taking down the illegal structure? Take it down, and leave. I represent the Buildings Department. If Party B is willing to pay, Party A will stop pursuing the matter. Mr. Wong, the Commerce, Industry and Tourism Branch requires submission of an application for all billboards. And they are taxable, too. Did you apply? -I think there's a misunderstanding here. -What misunderstanding? Please read what's on the receipt. Sponsor... Sponsorship fee? They sponsor my art creation. May I ask what department is responsible for creative art? The ones you two represent, right? No, theirs. The Leisure and Cultural Services Department. -Yep, that's right. -What do you mean? Would you please help us out as you're already here. -We'll go back and work on it first. -Right. We'll call a meeting to work on it. -We've already got their contact number. -Yes, we've got your number. -We'll call you after looking into this. -Please help me settle it. -Sponsorship is also a fee, right? -Mr. Lo. This is a settlement consent. If you agree to it, you'll receive $500 a month from me as a sea view compensation fee. Idiot! It should be $3,000 at least. Crazy! Who does he think we are? No less than $5,000. No way, not even for $10,000. It's just not fair. I understand that you are not in it for the money. But we must find an appropriate department to file our complaint in first. They have to look into our case before we discuss how and when to take down that thing, right? The Commerce and Economic Development Bureau? No. Because they only care about commercial products. The Buildings Department also no, because they only care about public housing estates. -The EPD, everybody knows it's... -Hubby. You're confusing me. -Let me repeat-- -Don't. You are too calm. He's all by himself, but there are five of us. We'll just walk right in and chase him out. Agreed. Dad, isn't it most important to prove that the billboard is not art? It isn't art? Stop. Please take a look. Hi, young fellow! Hi, handsome. Hi. Hi, please support us. Hello, everyone. I'm the district councilor. Everyone knows who I am. Let me thank all the specialists and fellow residents first. Thank you for coming to such an important appraisal meeting. We'll be very open, fair, and just, in our appraisal of the item that Hoi Yuan Court has complained about, which is now erected on the rooftop of Tin Hing Mansion. Whether it's a private art work or an advertisement shown to the public for a commercial product. Let's start with the complainant, Mr. Lo. Hello, everyone. Thank you for coming here today to help us make a fair decision. I'd like to recommend a simple and easy way for everyone to tell the difference between an art work and commercial advertising. Now what's in my kids' hands are some art works that we often see. Such as Xu Beihong's painting of horses, or Picasso's work. Whereas what my father and wife are holding are some commercial advertising billboards that we see every day. And this is the one blocking our window. Apparently, this is an illegal billboard built for commercial advertisement. I hope this will help you reach a decision more easily later when you cast your vote. Thank you, everyone. Good. Good job, Dad. OK... Now please welcome the defense's turn, Mr. Siu Choi Wong. Thank you. This painting is pixelated because of copyright. You might not be able to see it clearly. This is the very famous Andy Warhol's "Campbell's Soup". My question is, what's the difference between this painting and advertisements for soups of this brand? What I'd like to stress is that the billboard on my rooftop that Mr. Lo talked about is actually an art work. Thank you. But why is the retailer's address and phone number on your art work? Isn't it evident that it's an advertisement? I put down my phone number so that anyone who likes my work can communicate with me. Among them, someone might even want to pay me. Leaving a phone number is quite reasonable. Stop quibbling! There's no doubt it's a commercial advertisement. OK, OK... Let's vote now, OK? Let's vote. -I have something to say. -Yes? Can I get a juice before I vote? Go home and drink some water if you're thirsty, then come back here. What do you know? I live across the street. It's quite a walk. Across the street? Are you here to support us or that asshole? No, I had nothing else to do. Nothing else to do? Do you know why we are here? Environmental protection? How dare you come for fruit juice? I can't even see it? I have something to say. I spotted Siu Choi Wong through my binoculars yesterday. He flicked his cigarette butt onto the billboard when he finished smoking. So it can't be his art work. Sis, Would Da Vinci flick his cigarette butt onto Mona Lisa's hands? No. Because he used a cigarette butt to stain the billboard, I think that is a kind of behavioral art using rubbish to contaminate the hegemony of advertising. Thank you. What did he say? Thank you. My work and I together are behavioral art. From now on, everyone is welcome in my home to view my work every Saturday. You are free to spit on my work too. I'm in a hurry I hope everyone will cast a vote. Thank you. Actually, I'm in a hurry too, so why don't we vote now, OK? Put up your hand for behavioral art, please. -What's the point. -I don't know what's going on. -Let's go. -There is no gift for voting. Don't go! Vote first. It only takes a second. Don't go. Please. Hubby. Vote... Stop mumbling or I'll stop pushing. Traitor. -Shut your mouth. -Stop blaming Yu Sze, nobody wanted to vote. What is this? Whose garbage is this? More? Horrible. It's the die-hard smoker. No more smell of cigarettes I heard that he had depression. Even if he didn't want to see a doctor, there was no need to jump out of the window. Maybe he didn't make it to a doctor, or he didn't take his medicine afterward. His wife urged him to see a doctor for his own good. Maybe he thought killing himself was for his wife's own good, too. Hubby. From now on, you don't need my permission to do anything I'll get myself a mistress. Do you want to jump out of the window? Shall we jump together? GIVE YOUR BABY TENDER LOVING MILK Get up. Get up. Cheung is waiting for you downstairs. Don't you know I was working on sleeping? OK, enjoy your sleep. I'll go get Mrs. Chiu to get you out of bed. OK, thank you, Mrs. Cheung. Since you worry so much about Cheung waiting downstairs, why don't you go get Mrs. Chiu to wake me up? Nutcase. What's new, Cheung? Congratulations. The size of the billboard you provided exceeds the maximum size of general household items. Therefore, whether his billboard is artwork, or for commercial use, he'll have to take it down as it endangers the safety of the general public. That's good. Justice at last. How long will it take? Filing, examination and approval, booking of appointment, removal. About six years. That billboard has been blocking our view for several months already. My family is going bananas. How can we wait six years? Can you imagine? Six years. Is there any justice left for us, man? That's just the way it is. Many village houses with illegal rooftops are still awaiting removal after 16 years. Be patient and wait a little longer. Wishing you and Suk Yin a nice and comfy home. Goodbye. This one, boss. OK. The fish is mine. It's in my hand. -Let it go. -You let it go. I said let it go. You let it go. I said let it go. I said let it go. How dare you take my fish, bitch. I said let it go. -Let it go. -Stop screaming, ladies. Here's another one, same as that one. They are twins, each of you take one home, OK? No need to fight, $30 each. OK? You deserve that, how dare you. There you are, collecting rent again? I'll pay only if you can convince me. I feel lost. Make your decision quickly, please. I don't have it. I would give it to you if I did right? -Move. -Pardon? The law states you should move when you fail to pay rent for three months. It's very noisy next door, I can't hear you. They're so loud! I really can't hear what you're saying. -Kit. -What? -Turn the loudspeaker down. -Why? He can't hear me, can't hear what I say. That couple is making lots of noise too. Why don't you stop them? Keep your voice down. Please keep your voice down. OK? I told you people, no cooking here. If it catches fire, it could cost many people's lives. Keep your voice down, fatty. Are you done? Think tossing a few things around will make me pay? Let me see more. What are you doing? What are you doing? Stay cool. Stay cool. -Don't. -Let's die together. Let's all die together. Let's die together. Let's all die together. Well? Whatever you want to tell me. No? You haven't got me out here for a year. C'mon, tell me. Sorry, Dad. I can't hang on any longer. You're still young, everything's gonna be OK. Be brave. Any difficulty you come across, just overcome it. It has nothing to do with bravery, Dad I've tried everything, yet can't get anything done. It's isn't you young folks' fault. It's my fault, I'm a burden on the family. Help me jump off here, our family will be much happier. Hey! Stop fooling around. -You'll have one less mouth to feed. -Get down, Dad. The flat will be more roomy, too I've got insurance. You and the family could go for a trip. How nice. That's right, a little further. OK, push. Ready... count to three. One, further. -Push, c'mon. -No. You're a good-for-nothing! Why not? You're not a man, you're a useless bum. There's no point scolding you. You're not tough enough to be my son. -Get down and sit down. -Think of your wife. Don't force me! I said I can't. Why can't you? Because surveillance videos are all around here, I would go to jail. Would you have let go of me if there weren't surveillance videos? Let's find someplace with no surveillance first. Quiet! What time is it? Haven't you made enough noise? Oh, no! Mom, Dad, something's happened to the old fart. Don't die yet, go to the hospital first. I will be very unhappy if you die, Grandpa. But Prince Charming usually favors unhappy girls. I'll enjoy the romantic unhappy feelings. Thank you, Grandpa. Die all you can, old fart. I won't stop you. I want a room of my own. Did you hear that, Dad? Don't drag it out any longer, make it quick. This hospital is very costly. I have to go to work to pay the mortgage. Don't you know I have no time to spend with you? Yes, Poppa. I've been looking after you for so long. It's time for a rest. I'll find a job as a subsidy when you're gone. Don't worry. If Wai Man gets a mistress when I'm at work, I'll find myself a new man, too. Then, I'll serve you tea to let you know. Enough! What's all this bullshit for? This is not even related. Didn't you two hear what I said? I want something evil, something cruel, to provoke him, to wake him up, understand? -C'mon. -Please die. Don't leave him to us. It's not up to us. Yelling at him at home is perfectly all right. But here, I just can't ask him to die. You don't want to do it, what if he's really dying? Grandpa. -Old fart. -Waking up? -Go home tomorrow, we're short of beds. -You can check out soon, old fart. I dreamed of you when you were seven or eight years old in a park, some kids bullied you. It was just a dream. Do you remember the song I taught you? "Breaking one arrow is easy, breaking a bundle is not." I do. You taught me, I taught them, we all know that song I want to hear it. Seriously? I want to hear it. -United we win... -Let's go home first, Poppa. Sing it. Let's sing together. Whoever did this lacks social ethics. Happy birthday. My birthday is still a month away. Our hometown celebrates birthdays a month ahead, which allows enough time for luck to arrive. So interesting? Since we are neighbors, and you live alone, if you need any help, feel free to look for us. We didn't know anybody when we first moved here either. We had some very difficult times. We know how you feel. In school, I was always bullied. But at home, my parents love and support me. This is a terrible world. Only family can protect us. And what's most important to our family is the window. The window with a sea view. Therefore, we hope you can... move the board to the side a little bit. I worked very hard to make money after university. So that I could give my parents a comfortable life. After that, I could meet a girl, buy a flat, have many kids, and let my parents play with them. But all my colleagues at work... either stabbed me in the back or slandered me. Whatever I did, they wanted to take credit for my achievements. My whole life... I've never trusted my friends. I've promised myself that I must hang in there for my work. However, it never rains, but it pours. All of a sudden, my father died in a car accident. My Mom felt great sorrow and had a stroke. She also had cataracts so she was unable to see clearly. I said to myself, whatever it took, I wanted my Mom to see again. But last year... she had another stroke and passed away. Madam Wong. You must stay strong, young man. He went through so much in his life. It must be because he was bullied when small, So now he's doing the same thing and bullying us. Stop weeping! He's faking. Don't be fooled. Why don't we let him go, Dad? No, we can't. Mercy to your enemy is cruelty to yourself. That's right! We must protect our home. I can't die. Thank you, billboard. Thank you for letting people know I exist. The flat it is a little old and a little small. But it doesn't matter, because here's a huge open space. See how open and wide this is? The air is fresh, too. Sunlight. This is a real good flat, isn't it? Well? What do you think? Nice? Expensive flats, sea view. But their prices are way too high. I think this is better. Also, I know the owner pretty well. How about I talk him into cutting the price a little bit, OK? Deal? Here? Do you know what I want? Any bookings for viewing our flat? Didn't I already tell you there were none? Make a couple more calls, please? I called all morning. There really were none I'll give you a commission. Please help me. I do want to help you. I'd be rich by now if I had been able to help every customer. How may I help you? We want to get married, to buy a flat. Congratulations. This is a new flat, perfect for newly-weds 20% down payment, the rest... I heard this flat has just come on the market, it's quite a good one. Oh yes! This is an old flat. It's hasn't been renovated, and the residents are from all over the place. -It's no longer popular-- -There's a sea view. -I remember that. -The sea view is blocked. -There's no view of any kind. -It'd be hard to resell it. It's the cheapest in this neighborhood. Cheap? A further cut of one million, want it? -Of course not, I'm not crazy. -What about you? One million? No way. (Siu Yu Babe) Who is it? Are you Bun Hong Lo? Does it mean I've lost the chance of studying overseas? My life insurance only pays $400,000 when I die. And now our flat has plunged one million in value. We're done! We have nothing left. The price has really gone down one million. It's one million, man. We live in our flat, so no matter how high or low the price is, it won't affect us, right? Have you finished eating? Almost! But the shrimps are very delicious. Boss. One more order of shrimps, and one more beer. -OK. -More food? Butcher, oh no... Mr. Butcher, give us an answer, please? How much do you want us to compensate you? Our family hasn't been in a good mood lately. Actually, we feel pretty bad. I wasn't feeling that great either. And my head, I can't think. It was just an accident. Accident? I really heard someone say, "He'll die without his fat!" Then my head got hit. This was really murder. Damn! Call the police. Put me in jail. Sit down. Fuck! I'll hit my head to pay you back. -Sorry. -Don't, grandpa. He's my son, let me do it. -Hubby. -Forget it, honey. Let me do it. Don't hit your head, Dad. I didn't say I would hit my head. Hit mine. I'll never hit my family heads. This is a crazy family, real crazy. OK, hit each other's heads. I'll think on this and decide. Cancel my shrimp dish, boss. It's OK. We know each other, it's not serious. Fatty went to take a pee, he'll be back soon. Sit down and eat! Sorry, boss. -Do you still want a beer? -Yes. -OK. -Thank you. Wait a minute. Lobster, abalone, giant grouper, and tiger shrimp. They all have high cholesterol, I can't eat them. Eat some, Poppa. We have nothing left now. They'll be unaffordable soon. Get me a bottle of XO brandy, I haven't had it for 18 years. Quick. Good for you! Be right back I'll go shopping tomorrow, shop my brains out. Shopping. Expensive meals, luxury goods. Where is the money? Lobster, abalone, buying good stuff. Our flat has dropped one million in price. Don't remind me! It's one million. You manage subdivided flats. You should've known better. You should've known that the billboard would make our flat drop in value. Property prices go up and down every day. Do we sell when the price rises? If we did, where would we live? Everything I do, I do it for my family. I know I'm not smart. That I can't even deal with a little problem like this. But what can I do? I've done everything I can. Didn't I tell you before that the five of us should go over and do him in together? How? I've been to every single government department for a solution. Still nothing has been done. Just kill him. Crazy. Eat! Crazy. How much? -What can I do for you, Mrs. Lo? -Not this. I want that. Sleeping pills, the strongest type. Sleeping pills. What's next? Think of an excuse to get him over for a meal. Come over to eat with us, Choi. Come back. Are you nuts? We haven't got any food ready yet. Put away the stuff first, hurry. Hide everything I'll open the door. What are you doing here? Someone glued the keyhole of my door. Would you let me crawl in through your window? Why don't you move since you can't get in? It's not safe to crawl, you might get yourself killed. Couldn't agree more. What? Aren't I right? OK, go ahead! Stand up. Help yourself. Would this put us... He asked to do it himself. Right. Shall we help him? Still a chance... Fall... See, it's done. Thank God. We can take it down now. He's alive. Why is this jerk so tough? What are we gonna do? We do what we planned to do. How much? All of it. All of it? Yes, all. All of it. What are you doing? Soup tasting. All the pills are in it. Success. Success. Hi, Choi. -For you, Mrs. Lo. -Thank you. Very kind of you. Please come in. Thanks. -Choi. -Hi, folks. -Choi. -Dinner time? -Let's eat first. -Thank you. Did you sign the agreement, Mr. Lo? I'm going back. Have some soup first I don't deserve this. Drink some. OK, thank you. -How is it? -Very good. Very good, eh? Did you sign the agreement, Mr. Lo? Why don't you stay for dinner, and drink some more soup? Oh no, I don't want to bother you. Oh yes, I've prepared a lot of dishes, C'mon. OK. Make some room for Choi. If you already signed the agreement, Mr. Lo, I'll pay you two months as a compensation fee now. OK? Let's talk about that later. I know you don't really care about it, but I do. My son can't find a job. Why don't you help him to get one? Choi? Help me, please? I'm only self-employed I'll go get you a bowl and chopsticks. No need, I'll order some take-out. Mr. Lo... Why isn't it working? Not a high enough dose? Why don't we put in some more, OK? Where are the pills? Wine. Wine and drugs together are guaranteed to work. Their mother is a very good cook. Let us celebrate the occasion with wine. Have a drink! Enjoy the dinner I've just finished the soup. Now wine? We must drink to this. Dad! Have a drink. I haven't had any wine for more than 10 years. Happy. Bottoms up. OK, bottoms up. Toast to our agreement. Good. Bottoms up. -You have a drink too. -OK. Have a drink. We don't do this every day. Cheers. Bottoms up. OK Eat something. You said with wine will work, how come he's still sober? Choi. -Wine. -Yes, wine. -More. -More. Bottoms up. A little more. Bottoms up. Bottoms up, everyone. Bottoms up. Choi. More. Choi. I really have to go I must leave before I change my mind. Choi. Mr. Wong. Let me tell you, I haven't had such a heart-warming dinner since my parents' death. Thank you so much for the meal. Thank you. Mr. Wong. Choi. Choi. (I hate this world) Guess when the police will find out about him? Why don't we go to a movie? Why? We have to have an alibi. OK, let's go. Is it still in to go out to movies? Don't you just get a set-top box at home, and watch thousands of mega-movies? That person has run away. Coming. Who is it? Open the door, hubby. Choi. Have you forgotten something, Choi. Right, Choi? Did you forget your phone here? Do you want more soup? Get Choi some soup. Or some wine. Did you think you could use sleeping pills and wine together to kill me? Not even a full bottle of sleeping pills can put me to sleep at night. Now we're looking at a table full of evidence. You are doomed if I call the police now. There has been a misunderstanding, Choi. No misunderstanding. In fact, I want to say thank you. Please sit, Choi. My original plan was just to make some money with the billboard. I didn't expect your property value to drop. So, when you all go to jail, I'll pay low price to buy your flat, then take down the billboard, and sell this place at a high price. With the money I make here, I can move to a rich neighborhood and do the same thing again. Soon, I'll be rich. Asshole. C'mon, wanna stab me. I'll call the police now. C'mon. Don't. Have we murdered him? He's not breathing. We couldn't get our happy days back... unless we killed you. Your death is most valuable to us. What's next? -Take him back to his place. -Again? Make it look like suicide by burning charcoal. But he's already dead, he can't inhale charcoal gas. The police will find out. Come on. Bad dreams again? Many people, many things happened. It's very scary, I fell into the water. Take some headache pills I did I had seven. Might as well take the last one. Look out the window. It's gone. Enough looking, get back to work. Mom, he was so heavy. Dad and I might not be able to hang him up. Don't use this chopper to slash him, I want to chop him. What are you people doing? What can we cook with such a big pig? Braised pork with preserved vegetables. Pork belly with shrimp paste. -Pig ears are good. -No. Pork pie. Police. Your family is suspected of involvement in a murder case. We have to take you all back to assist in the investigation. Help. What happened? After Siu Choi Wong's body was recovered from the sea, the police found our electricity and water bills in his mouth. That's how we got arrested. The expert witness testified in court that all our family has gone insane. In the end, we were sent to a mental hospital. But it was good for us. There is a very beautiful sea view. Grandma, sign here. Is your grandson in? Is anyone here literate? I said I didn't order takeaway. Her false tooth has come off. Why are we doing this? I said this many times. For what? Only a harmonious family will prosper. -Please drive me to the train station. -Not going. -I didn't say which one. -Not going to any train station. It's just pee. Just washing your legs will do. Making a mountain out of a molehill. Coming. The door is open. Who didn't shut the door? Of course it's you. What vegetables are fresh today? Both choy sum and tomatoes are good today. My mom always asks my boyfriend if he has a house. It's freezing out there. Why are you wearing so little? It's beautiful. Which is our building? I don't know. You say what I should do. But what if I don't understand English and I'm illiterate? What are you doing? Don't use a stick, a knife is faster. Come on. Kill your entire family... Have some tea. No need to be so formal. Just drink it.
