I think it has everything you need. Tell me if you need anything. Money. No need, because I'm going to live with you. - Sister, you too? - Of course! I won't let a child like you live alone. I'm not a child! Listen. I didn't rent this room for you to do whatever you want. Compared to home... It is safer, right? I already told your high school that you'd quit. - You finally did it! - What are you excited about? Atutor will come over to teach you. I don't need a tutor. It's all because your home and school are dangerous! You got lucky this time! The guy who followed you must have been trying to kidnap you! No way! You should be careful! It was only an attempt this time... but you should be careful before it actually happens! If you're really worried about kidnapping, let's just use all of our father's money! The tutor is also your bodyguard. Whatever. Kick stronger! Stronger! Hey, Shinji! Are you listening? Kick properly! Kick stronger! Okay... Today, let's learn how to move the arms. Okay, show them. First of all, stretch your arms. The space should be shoulder to shoulder. And when you move your arm, move it forward, showing your armpit. Okay. Let's do it, everyone! Okay, ready? Go! 1. 2. That's right. Keep doing it. Keep looking straight forward. Straight ahead. Hey, over there! Keep doing it. Straight! Straight from the armpit. Miss! Do it like this! Don't raise it too high. Go straight. Show me... No! Just a little... Excuse me! - What? - These guys... They're scary! - Aren't they your friends? - No way! You're not her friends? No... You smell! Who the fuck are you? Stop it! You should stop wandering around and take a shower first! Why don't you learn swimming? Thank you... If you want to learn swimming, come to the Saiki Swimming School. Listen, Wataru. Let me explain. X is the function of Y. So, when the value of X changes... Y also changes according to that. Math is interesting, isn't it? Isn't it? Huh? Where are you going? Wataru! Maybe he has to pee. The toilet is that way! Huh? Really? Huh? Maybe he want to take a walk? You should follow him! You are his bodyguard too! You keep saying "bodyguard." Who is actually trying to kidnap him? Things would be easy if we knew that! Ah, I see! That makes sense! No way... But I'm not sure I can actually fight. You can't? Didn't you tell me during the interview that you could do judo? Ah, that? I did when I was in middle school. That's what I meant. It's been more than 30 years ago. I turned 40 this year. But... I'm a virgin. Are you selling the swimming school? I have met many people to raise money, but no one helped me. The number of students is gradually increasing though. I am sorry about that. It's just that the debt is too high. I didn't plan the budget properly. Anyway, if I don't get about 10 million by this month... someone else will get the ownership of the swimming school. You even declined a job as a university coach to join this swimming school. I am really sorry about that. Sorry. Please stop saying that! Every job has pros and cons. And I didn't take this job because it was good. I would do anything for you. Kazama... We still have a month, so let's do something! Okay? Like this, right?! Before 1982... In the past, it was okay, but now it's different. Going through your hip like that. Right. Going through your hip like this. Ah! I see... Move like this... - The hips should be... - Ah, here? I move like this... Yes, like that... Let me show you. Look... Like this. Push strongly through the water. Push strongly. Strongly. Strongly. Strongly. Strongly. Strongly. - Strongly. - Ah, sorry. Sorry. Move more strongly. Like this, right? Even stronger. Like this. About this strong? Even stronger. Stronger. Does it feel good? Yes, it does. Me too. Let's do the butterfly. Yes. Clench your ass! Relax! Clench! Stay like that for a while... Relax... Clench! Clench it tightly! Clench it tightly! Clench it even tighter! Yes? This is Kazama. This is Akiko Nozawa. You saved me the other day. Ah, hello! I am sorry for the sudden call. Actually, I have something to discuss with you. Bodyguard? Yes. There are some people... trying to kidnap my younger brother to get our father's money. So, we are trying to hide from them by changing locations. Well, why don't you go to the police? Yes. I have discussed this with them. Ah, you haven't paid your taxes, have you? That's the problem. I am in the same situation. I haven't paid for 2 years now. So, they can't help me at all. Our house is a luxurious mansion in Setagaya. Ah... But they won't protect us until something actually happens. Can you please work for us? How much can you pay per hour? You'll be handsomely rewarded, of course. Handsomely? And... I like you. Oops! Well, I'm not interested. Huh? - Hey! - Huh? You are my tutor, aren't you? That's correct. But don't talk to me. Ah, look! Aren't you supposed to teach me? Do you want me to? Not really. So, what's the problem? I can't do this anymore! Do you have something else? No! Let's buy one then. You will bother me at the disco. This is my job. I am your employer. I order you to leave. You are not. Your sister is my employer. It's not that I want to go. Who is he? Who is that dude? Huh? My bodyguard! Bodyguard? Let's fuck with him! Hurry! You guys are slow! Your legs are weak! Learn to swim! Aren't you supposed to supervise high schoolers? I'm a bodyguard. I'm not your dad. By the way... I want to play Sevens. Let's play Sevens! Sevens? That's lame! What is lame about it? Okay, let's play Old Maid! Huh? What the... The game isn't over yet! Do we have to stay with him? Well, I will do something. You have to help me. Yeah, of course. I don't feel like playing with him around . The loser has to take off his underwear. What the hell? Okay... It's big. You have a cute ass! You were not supposed to do that! Wataru is still a minor! Yes. You were not supposed to let him stay out overnight! I just stayed at Makoto's house for the night! I don't like that tone! Didn't you let him stay out sometimes? I didn't! You are saying he stayed out for the first time last night? You are not supposed to ask that! Yes. - Kazama. - Yes. I have something to discuss with you. Yes. Can we meet in private? Just the two of us. - Wataru. - Yes? It's time to go. Where? Where? I promised you before. Okay, let's go. - Wataru, let's go! - Wait... Let's go. Stupid idiot! What are you doing? I don't want to swim! - Are you afraid? - No way! Go! Go! Swimming is the best way to train your body! Because you have to move your entire body! So what? Stop complaining and go! Go! I know the best way to protect you. It's to make you strong. Can you swim to the other side? Good! - This way! - Huh? I'm going to separate Wataru from that guy. Tetsuya... Makoto... Hey, guys! Why don't you drink some? Cheers! - Where am I? - In Makoto's room. You were too drunk, so I brought you here. Where is Wataru? He is still dancing with Makoto and the others. I guess you are still drunk. You should take some rest. I'll make you comfortable. Hello? This is Nozawa. We have your brother. put together 30 million. Hey! Wake up! I said wake up! - What is it? - Where is Wataru? Where did he go? Where? He went back home! - Alone? - Yes. Where is Wataru? Where the hell did you go? Hasn't he come back yet? - He has been kidnapped! - Huh? They were asking for a ransom on the phone! More importantly, if anything bad happens to Wataru, it's your fault! Sorry... I am sorry... Hello? Is the money ready? Yes. We'll meet at the 3rd wharf, at 7 o'clock. Come alone. If you tell the police, your brother is dead. Understood? Are you alone? I am! I told his sister to come! She asked me to do it! Where is the money? In here! Okay. Throw the bag this way! You should release him first! Stop complaining! If you don't do what I say, he's fucking dead! Wataru! Are you okay? Hey! Bastards! No... Huh? He deceived us? No way! Your brother is such a bastard! Extorting this much money to use as pocket money? My job is over. You should pay me as you promised. Okay? Of course. - You'll actually keep your promise? - Yes. Okay... I didn't have to be rough then. I think so too. I see. Please use this to pay the debt. - But... - Don't say anything! Please don't shut down the swimming school! Kazama... Touch your feet. Spread your legs. Go! Get out at the finishing point. Ready. Swim to the other side. Go! Like this. Ready... Here. Lower your head or you might fall. Next round. Okay. Ankles further apart. Lower your head. Lower it! Go! Next! Okay... Ready... Do you feel like learning to swim now? Your job isn't over yet. I have no time to play with you. I think someone is really trying to kidnap me. I am serious! This is not the first time! Strangers have followed me several times in the past. Oh, really? You poor thing! I am sorry about the other day. I apologize, but someone is really trying to kidnap me this time. So, I came here. Please be my bodyguard. No, the bodyguard job is not over. You deceived me! Stop saying stupid shit! Who the hell are you? Let's go! Are you okay? Yes. Ouch! It hurts... Hey, be careful... Okay, slowly... That's it, slowly. Lower it a little... They looked serious. They would kill a person to get the money. What should I do? Don't worry. I will be your bodyguard again. Really? But you shouldn't rely on others too much when you need protection. You should also become strong. Okay. - Are you afraid? - Yes. I am too. But the fear gives us courage. Got it? Yes. Wataru... What's wrong? It doesn't look healthy. It's not supposed to look like that. Alright! That's it! That's it! Alright! It looks healthy now. That's right. Alright! Alright! Like this? Like this? Like this? This is it! Okay. How about this? It's going well. Okay. It's looking good. Does it feel good? Courage makes you feel good. - Okay... - Mister... I want it. I can't help it. Let's go. Turn around. Spread your legs. Come on. It's going well. Wataru... Come on. Good boy. Are you okay? Aren't you afraid? No. Okay. I'll put it in. Okay? Yes. Like this? Mister... It's soft. I'll put it in.

You hit me, asshole! What does it feel like? Fear gives you courage. Got it? Bastard! Wait! Brother! Stop! No! Wataru! You did it! I don't know how to thank you. Thank you very much.
