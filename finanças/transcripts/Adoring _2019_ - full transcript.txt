Timing and Subtitles brought to you by Adoring Team @ Viki Okay, good boy. - Bye bye. - Be careful. Let me sleep a little longer. Xiao Zha, my phone. Get my socks. Hello, Leyun? I'm up. I'm just waiting for Xiao Zha. Seriously, I'll be there really soon. Wait a moment! I'm so sorry. Thanks. What a coincidence, I run into you here every time. I'm so glad you waited for me or else I'll be late again. I'm almost on the blacklist at the office. My name is Luo Hua, we're neighbors. Let us get to know each other. Hello. I'm An Ying. What are you doing? Flossing my teeth. You didn't even eat breakfast yet. Why are you cleaning your teeth? It feels nice. You're so weird. I'm telling you. What's wrong? Losing your temper in the morning. Didn't we say that we'd celebrate this year's birthday at your house? How come we came to the hotel again? It's a surprise party! What kind of surprise party? It'd be a real surprise if we go to your place. Are you hiding something at home? I'm not hiding anything. Put two small flower baskets over here. Bouquets on the left side. Supervisor, we still need the bride's confirmation with this. Where's the bride? Where did she go? Zhao Le. Zhao Xiao Le? You weren't found out, were you? Hao Qi! Hao Qi, you appeared again. Hao Qi! Back up! Sit. Husband, are you okay? Every time, it's like we're cheating. No wonder your mom agreed so fast, you will never get married with this guy around. I believe that everyone here today will sincerely wish this couple well. There aren't any objections to this marriage, right? Shut up, Hao Qi. Sorry, I'm so sorry, I'll bring my ID next time. My name is Cao Wende. This is my first workday and you see, I'm about to be late. Thank you. - Excuse me. - I don't know. Do you know where Building C2 is? My daughter, school just ended? Hi, Angela. Can you see me? Hi Sister, I see you. I miss you so much. Did you just get off school? Yes, baby, have you been behaving well? I've really missed you. I've been really good. I miss you more! I miss you so much that I can't wait for you to come back in the summer to play with me! When I come back, I will bring you to the US, how's that? Then we won't have to call long distance. What if your mom's boyfriend doesn't like me? What if he bullies me while you're not home? If he dares, I'll terminate him. Good daughter. You don't want me to take the cat away or what? How's that possible? She annoys me so much. I wish you could take her away right now. If you go to the US, where will you be able to eat such good homemade food? Canned food? That's only for New Years. Those Americans are stingy. Unlike me. Just like your biological father, I buy you boxes of it. Look. I made nothing special for myself. Nothing special. See? The ladies? Getting them back? They already have their own lives. It's not that they don't want me. I was the one who lost them. So... I don't want to lose you too right now. Us two depending on each other, it's pretty good. [Adoring] On the surface, it seems like the stocks will increase by twenty percent within one week of acquisition. Trust me. These deals are customary tactics. Just tricks to lure in the buyers. That's right, nothing but a capitalist's bait. The stock prices will definitely hit bock bottom. I know what to do. Don't worry. Surprise! How did you find this place? What are you doing? - Open the door. - Open the door. Whenever I said I wanted to come to your house, if it's not the floor is broken, it's leaking water. Or the balcony needs to be fixed. I can't even make any more excuses for you. If we continue like this, is your house going to go through PMS? Isn't this house pretty good? Why won't you let me come? Aren't you here now? Why are you sweating? Why are you so nervous? Why are you so suspicious? Am I suspicious? So what if I am? Who knows if you're hiding another white and chubby mistress at home or not? How could I? Darling, darling! Wait, wait. Listen to me. That. Oh, oh, oh my! That, that, that— - What's that? - Xiao Dingdang! That. That is. That is Xiao Dingdang. What Xiao Dingdang? That is a pig! She's the pet that I'm raising. This— This— This is a pet? Dingdang. Dingdang. Don't be afraid. - Li Xiang, you have a pet pig? - She won't hurt you! You— You, you, you can't go. Oh my gosh. The leash. Where's the leash? Help! Don't follow me! The more you keep running, the more she will chase you! Go to hell! Don't go downstairs! Xiao Dingdang! Don't come here. Don't come here. Don't come here. Oh my! Xiao Dingdang! Xiao Dingdang, don't be like this! Xiao Dingdang, be obedient! Good. Why are you so excited today? She didn't scare you, did she? You scared Sister. Who is her sister? You are her sister! Be her sister, all you want! It's okay, it's fine. You pig-loving liar! Xiao Dingdang, be good. It's okay. Be good, Dingdang. Be good, Dingdang. Feifei! Feifei! Stay with your pig! It's actually a pig! She even attacked me and she went right on me. I was so disgusted, do you know that? Isn't he a fund manager? What about fund managers? They are still not entitled to have a pig in their house. Well, fund managers have high incomes so they also have high stress, they definitely have some fetishes. Fetish? It's a freaking horror movie! That freak is rolling around on the ground with a pig, even behavioral artists don't do that. Enough, isn't it just having a pig? Don't fight with a pig. It's hard to look after a pig, if he can manage that, it'll be a piece of cake managing you. Are you complimenting me or scolding me? Of course, it is complimenting you. I'm going to hang up. Don't! Can't you talk with me a little longer? Are you that busy? She's really busy. Honey. It hurts! Honey, I— Hao Qi, let go. Let go! What are you doing? Let go! Let go! I told you— I told you to let go! Let go! She's not your wife! You can't be so hard on him. Baby, I love you. Let our wings spread in June and let our ambitions shine. Today, let's make a vow in the name of youth towards our bright futures. Up next, we have a special activity for this year's ceremony. As you can all see, there is a high stage up there. It's called "challenge." If there is a student that needs a recharge, you may get up on that stage. - Nannan! - Nannan! - What? - You can voice your ambitions out loud. -Nannan. - What? I can assure you that you will walk down feeling recharged. Alright. Who wants to be the first to stand up there? Go challenge yourself and recharge yourself! Are there any students that would like to be the first to stand up on this challenge stage? Teacher! I want to go up on the challenge stage. He must have gone crazy. Hello everyone, I'm Chen Leyun from Year Three Class Two. Half a year ago, I lost my eyesight because of a disease. I had no choice but to start living as a blind person. I'm very scared, and it's also so unfair. So I want to challenge myself. I won't let myself be unseen just because I can't see this world. I believe one day my eyes will be better! You will be better! Jiayou, Leyun! Chen Leyun, you're awesome! You rock! Cool! Don't you have anything to say to Jiang Nan? Don't do that. Stop it. Jiang Nan! Jiang Nan! When you were on the stage today, they asked you to say something to me, how come you said nothing? You made me very embarrassed, you know? Not just awkward. It was super awkward. I did say something. What did you say? I didn't hear a single word. The microphone was shut off. Really? Yup. Then what did you say? What did you say? What did you say? I'm not telling you. You're not telling me, right? Let's go. Take care. Zhazha, let's go, he's on his own. Jiang Nan! Jiang Nan! Put it down. - Feifei. - Don't talk. I need to think about whether I should cry or drool. Life. It's so beautiful. Which one? Which one do you choose? You're here? I didn't get to thank you properly yesterday. I made this for you. Food. It's for you. Try it. Young man, don't be scared, that dog is scared of people. He hides when he sees people. I heard the community is clearing stray dogs. They hired specialists to catch them. They are afraid the stray dogs would spread disease. What specialists? They are from restaurants killing dogs. Dog? We have more help today. Make this net bigger. Stay sharp. Be observant. Suhyun, he's here, four o'clock. Stop looking at it. Don't look! Don't move! He's testing us. What a professional. Go! Chase him! Don't let him get away! Move! Don't block me! Don't block me! That way! Go to the left! Minho, Joongki, follow me! Old rules, you pick. If you pick the left one, we'll go home and I'll stay single. If you pick the right one, we will make room for Feifei. Pig, pig! Who are you calling pig? You're the pig! Pig! Boss, it's a pig! Go die! Screw off. It really is a pig! What are you waiting for? Keep chasing! Xiao Dingdang! What a coincidence. It's me! It's me. Can you help me out here? It's very urgent. Okay? It'll be fast. Come. Hurry, hurry, hurry! Hurry, hurry, hurry. Please, please. There's a kitten under the car. I will make it go out from here and you can catch it on the other side. Kneel down. Come. Come, kitty, come. Come on. It's gone to your side. - Kitty, come here. - Come. Come. This way. - I caught it! - Great! That's great! Thanks! It's okay now. It's alright. Thank you. Look, how cute. Here. Are you scared? No. Okay, then this cat will be ours. Half each. Let's go. Let's go eat something, okay? Let's go. The male lead is almost beaten to death in this chapter, what are you doing with the illustrations? you make my job as an editor really hard, do you know that? No one said the illustrations had to follow the story. Big Sister, if you don't follow the story, at least stick to the main theme, right? It's a super-spy and you drew it like a handsome oppa. What's your deal? Okay, okay. Leave me alone and go enjoy your honeymoon. So annoying. You're affecting my work. Each gets half, what does that mean? You appeared again? Hao Qi, we're legally husband and wife now. Hao Qi, why did you come out? Hao Qi, lick me. My Hao Qi never licks guys. Why? Because you're stinky. Hao Qi, lick me! Hao Qi, lick me a bit. Aren't this all for the kids' benefits? It's more convenient to go to school. Okay, then make an appointment with the landlord tomorrow. Let's look at apartments this week. We can sign the contract if it is suitable. You want to move just because you say so. Did any of you ask for my opinion? Isn't this because we're thinking about your future? It will be much closer to your high school. I don't mind waking up early. Nannan, you can't help Leyun even if we don't move. Hi. Are you busy? Can you help me take care of it? I have to go on a last minute business trip. Please. It's fine. It's normal to be scratched a few times when you're raising a cat. Don't be so nervous. Cats also bite people? People can bite people too. But Ying Zi, why are you raising a cat when you have such serious mysophobia? It's a favor. You must owe that person a big favor. The total is 726. How about I just sell you? Hulu, if you want to go to America with your sister, then you jump down now. Good. In your heart, you don't want to go to the US with your sister, right? We won't go then. Let's work hard together to discourage her, okay? Let me see. Close enough. Okay, begin. What? Your heart hurts so does mine. I bought this with my money. Home, sweet home! Hao Qi, are you happy? Are you happy? Our new house! A whole new life! So handsome, so beautiful, honey! You must be tired. We've ridden the plane for so long. Perfect, perfect! Newlyweds, new house. A brand new bed! Mom will open a can for you, okay? My bride. Look at your dad. Hubby. Honey. One, two, three! Stop it. It hurts so much! Hao Qi, come back. That's your dad! You can't bite him, do you understand? What kind of dog is this? Honey! I'm coming. - Check if I'm bleeding. Hurry and help me take a look. - Okay. - Not the left, right cheek! - The right side, the right side. Let me take a look. Don't move. It's just a scratch. I'll blow it for you. Why blow on it? Was he a slaughterer in his past life? How many ex-boyfriends did he kill? Where did he hide them? Tell me! Hubby, how come you have a pimple here? Help me squeeze it. 726! Come down! Get down here! Don't move. Why did you go up there? You! Come down! 726, don't, don't, don't! Don't move! Baby. Good, we won't take baths in the future. We will not take baths anymore. No more baths. Don't! How come he's chased me down here? What happened to my strongest villain ever? It's right there. This is a cat! It is a cat! How can it kill people? The main male character in the book is fighting against the strongest villain of his life. The coldest, coolest big boss. Why did you draw a cat? For what? Is she okay? I'm telling you if you buy fresh flowers or any plants, make sure to keep it out of her reach. Many flowers are poisonous. Don't you have mysophobia? Do all artists have to be like this? It is not my cat. It's driving me crazy. Can you take care of her for a few days for me? Doctor, I need a shot. What kind? Rabies vaccine. The one that's most wild. - Jiang Nan. - Auntie. He... - Open the door! - Don't bother me! Who are you yelling at? Open the door! Do you hear me? Get up! Or else I'm leaving. Hurry. What's up with you? Mental breakdown? You're moving? Why are you moving away? It was decided by the adults. You didn't even tell me that you're moving away. What a friend. Are you angry? Not because of this. I'm mad because even you're doing this to me now. Is it very hard to be straightforward with me? Can't you treat me like a normal person? You think I want to move? Xiao Zha, you must work hard. Thank you. It's not very realistic that you are training him yourself. Really. It's okay, Xiao Zha is very smart. Being smart is not enough. It's very difficult to train a guide dog. There is a reason why they get eliminated so easily. He can do all these moves. It's very easy. I'll give it a try. Then we are leaving. Xiao Zha, bye bye! Let's go, Xiao Zha. Bye bye! Let's try it tomorrow. Xiao Zha, does it look good? Let's try it on, okay? I know you don't want to. But can't you just help me with this favor? Come here. Put this on or no treats for you. What is that? Don't bite, don't bite! Xiao Zha! Xiao Zha! Let's talk. Xiao Zha, I know you feel wronged, but this means a lot to me. Please help me. Xiao Zha, go! Zha, Zha, Xiao Zha! Stop, stop, stop!

Since you're so dirty, I will call you Meiqiu (coal ball), okay? Then I'll take that as a yes.

You won't know if you don't try. Now, I'm gonna turn you into a basic cat. If you can cope with this lifestyle, I won't worry if you go to the US. We've been looking after her. She is becoming a little depressed. Xiao Dingdang. Don't be depressed, okay? He told me he is working overtime. The worst thing for couples is dishonesty.

We did it, Xiao Zha! ♫ It has only been a few weeks ♫ ♫ My mood is bad because you're not here~ ♫ I think the name Meiqiu is not good. It's too basic. I was watching TV the other day, and I heard a cute name. Wangcai (flourish wealth). What do you think? Hello, Wangcai! ♫ I really want to pamper you ♫ ♫ It has only been a few weeks ♫ What are you doing, Xiao Dingdang? Li Xiang, can you look after your pig? I should've seen this coming. My life is ruined by this pig. I think it was a mistake to let you bring her back. You've worked hard, Xiao Zha. Big dumb father! You're a big girl now. Where's Angela? Didn't you say you brought her here? Angela, Angela. She's been a beast lately. Look at my hand. Holy shit. How come you didn't cut her nails? Don't swear, shit. That's not a swear word. Did you bully Angela? Welcome. Angela! Oh my god, what happened? Bad cat. I had enough. Really Hurry and take her away. I can't stand this, it's too much. That's not right, Angela isn't like this. How can you tell from a small screen? That's how she is usually. Angela. It's true. Hurry and take her away. If you don't take her away, I'm going to give her away. You should give it away. I don't want to bring it to the US. Yes! How's it going? Angela! She peed all over me. Nice work. You've gone overboard! How could you do that? Come here, you should be punished. You dare! Why are you so loud? You're scaring her. Don't be scared, I'm not mad. I will protect you. No one can bully you. Isn't this dog scared of people? Why is it starting to rob things now? Let's go, let's take a look. C12, let's go. - What is happening? - What do you mean? He's employed? Hurry. That way! Now we got ourselves a situation. Who asked you to join me? So annoying. Are you sure she doesn't know how to climb stairs? She doesn't know how to climb the stairs, I swear. How did she climb the bathtub stairs then? Only two or three steps. Of course, she can't climb such a long staircase. Give me the elevator keys. From now on, I'm going to set a rule. When I'm home, the elevator cannot be opened. I won't come down and she can't go up. You. You go tell her. She... Looks like it grew bigger. Be careful. You bought all these for him? Thanks. There's quite a lot of things. You might need to make two runs. How much are these? I will pay you back. No need. Don't worry about it. I bought these for my half. You can enjoy the other half. Be nicer to my half. Don't mistreat him. I promise you I will treat your half even better than mine. You better. Mom, what is she doing? Is it safe to go, Xiao Zha? Jiang Nan trained Xiao Zha... Watch out for cars, Xiao Zha. Into a guide dog. Curb. Okay, I got up. How is it? Was it safe? I trained Xiao Zha for almost two months. He's really ready this time. Give it a try. Be brave, really! Xiao Zha is not a guide dog. Why are you forcing him? I did this for you! Who asked you to do this for me? Did I ask for a guide dog? Then who's going to walk you to school after I move? This is none of your business. Stay out of my business from now on. The high school entrance exam is coming up, do you know that? With your bad grades, and you are still here spending two months to train a dog? Go spend your time on something more important! Don't blame me when you end up not getting into a high school! Xiao Zha, you did very well. It's okay. He missed too many classes, and he is not familiar with braille yet. Are you not taking the test anymore? How can you not take it? Are you not going to high school? I wouldn't get in anyways. Son, listen to me. Get out. Let me stay here alone. How did you get up? What are you doing?! Let go! Are you trying to rob me? Let go! Let go, okay? What are you doing? Are you crazy? Help! Help! Let me do it. Didn't you say she doesn't know how to climb the stairs? I'm begging you. Send her away, okay? I can't take it anymore. Xiao Dingdang! Do you want to be scolded? You hurt her, do you know that? Feifei already let you come back home. What else do you want? You still want to watch cartoon during this matter? Can't you understand more? You don't need to watch cartoons in the future anymore! Boss, this money is to add more food to Xiao Dingdang's meal. She likes apple and pizza. I will come visit her next month. Let's not leave Xiao Dingdang here, - okay? - It's alright. Xiao Dingdang, we're leaving. Do you want to come for a hug? Xiao Dingdang, let's go home, okay? Xiao Dingdang? Xiao Dingdang, come. It's fine. She's doing well. - Thank you, please take care of her. - Xiao Dingdang! - Don't worry. - Thank you. - Good girl. - Aren't you going to take her away in a few days? What's with all these? I bought you an apartment. I'll get the keys in two months. When you grow up and isn't happy in the US, and you want to come back, Dad even prepared a house for you. Can't we focus on planning our own futures? How old are you? Do you know how to plan your future? I have to thank you and mom for the excellent failed marriage lesson. Do Americans all like to force the conversation into a dead end? It can't be helped. Kids these days mature early. They can chat like an adult when they are fourteen or fifteen. But adults don't talk like that. That's because you adults don't tell the truth. Isn't it exhausting to talk in circles? I think you hold prejudice against adults. If you want Angela to stay, why don't you just tell me? Let me ask you a question. if you can answer it, Angela can stay. Okay, ask away. Do you know when I am most sad? That year when I was nine, you and my mom divorced. None of you told me the truth for a year. I am most sad about this matter. Look, adults always think they've done right. Okay, I'll give you another chance. If you get Mu Ziyang's autograph for me, then Angela can stay. Mu? Mu what Yang? Mu Ziyang! Mu Ziyang! [Mu Ziyang Kwin] [Mu Ziyang Kwin] Mu Ziyang! I'm your fan! - That's right, I'm your number one fan! - Mu Ziyang! Mu Ziyang! Mu Ziyang! Mu Ziyang! Mu Ziyang! I love you! Mu Ziyang! Mu Ziyang! I love you! I love you! Mu Ziyang! I love you! Mu Ziyang! Xiao Mu! Xiao Mu! I love you! Yangyang! Help me sign an autograph for my daughter! I love you! Hello there, I just thought "Wangcai" is not a good name too. So I thought of another new name. Very cool. Called Zongcai. The English name is CEO. Hello, CEO. I think there are some misunderstandings between us. Let's have a good talk today, okay? I really love your mom. The long-lasting kind of love. So please, I beg you, please don't disturb our marriage life any longer, okay? Let's discuss something. Tonight, I will be in the bedroom with your mom, you shall stay in the living room. We're family, okay? No one bothers each other. Let's treat each other fairly, okay? If you're okay with it, then lick me once, okay? I guess we can't discuss it. Come here! There's no sound. Let's go out and take a look! Go out and take a look! There's no sound! - Hao Qi! - What's wrong? These are symptoms of heart failure, but whether there are signs of further complications, We would need to run other tests. Heart diseases are most common among older dogs. It's not because you didn't take good care of him. It's all our fault, we shouldn't have teased him like that. Net! Bring me the net, quick! Zongcai! Let him go! What are you doing? Who are you? Zongcai? Wangcai? Meiqiu? Who are you guys? They are not from the dog meat restaurant? They are the people Doctor Ai and I hired to catch Barton. His name is Barton? Why is he so afraid of people now? I think he had been through hell before. There are cigarette scars on him. Or maybe he witnessed terrifying things. It might also be that he survived and escaped from those dog meat restaurants. Then this dog is so smart, he even knows the way around. Of course, he does. - His owner was a postman in this area. - Barton, building C20! Barton has been to every door with him. Then what happened? Where is his owner? He was sick and needed to return to his hometown. Three years ago, he left Barton here. Then he never came back. He didn't make it. During that time, Barton waited for him every day. Then, one day, he disappeared. A couple of months later, he showed up again and became like this now. Barton, hurry. If dad didn't get the autograph, you're really going to take Hulu away? Then... will you still call me in the future? Do you really think I'm calling a cat? Do you think I'm ten? You're the one who doesn't know how to talk to me without the cat. You were the one who doesn't want to talk to me. Every time I talk to you, I choose my words carefully. I'm afraid to make you mad. You're my dad. You don't need to be careful with your words with me. Can't you coax me when I'm mad? Dads are supposed to coax daughters, do you not know that? Come back early! Chen Leyun, I'm leaving! You're not coming down to send me off? Seriously, we are friends. Are you really not going to send me off, Chen Leyun? [Jiang Nan] Dingdang, I had a date with Feifei today. It was great. Really. I think she has good impressions of me. But on our first date, I've already lied to her. She asked if I have any pets, I said no. I didn't dare to tell the truth. I was afraid she would mind. Say, if one day she finds out, would she forgive me? Would she be unwilling to be with me anymore? Then, do I have to separate from you completely? If that day ever comes, you must not blame Feifei. Do you hear me? You must not blame Feifei. What are you doing?! Let go! Are you trying to rob me? Xiao Dingdang! Let go! Let go, okay? What are you doing? Are you crazy? Help! When will you come back next time? We might all be college students. I will do my best to come back every summer. Don't forget us old classmates in the future. How come you all can eat such spicy food now? Because Leyun likes it. Can Chen Leyun's eyes still recover? He has Leber's optic neuropathy. He might not be able to recover. Mengmeng, drink this if you are afraid of the spiciness. This cuts down the spiciness. Thanks. Jiang Nan, Auntie wants to ask you for a favor. Feifei. Feifei? What's the matter? We were wrong about Xiao Dingdang. Xiao Dingdang, what are you doing? Let go! Xiao Dingdang, let go! Are you crazy? Help! Let's get her back! We will go now! I need to apologize to her. It's so late now. If you go now, won't you be bothering them? Let's go after breakfast tomorrow, okay? Okay. Then I'm going to clean up her room. Okay, okay. Xiao Zha! Xiao Zha! Xiao Zha? Xiao Zha? Is that you? Xiao Zha? Xiao Zha? Xiao Zha? Xiao Zha? Why are you here, Xiao Zha? Chen Leyun, I'm going on the challenge stage today. She must be crazy. Isn't Jiang Nan afraid of heights? Xiao Zha, I hope you still remember your training. [It's his first time going out. He wishes to be independent.] [It's his first time going out. He wishes to be independent.] I look pretty handsome in your drawings. Who said that drawing is you? You even memorized my work ID. Are you going on a business trip again? No. I just want to find a better owner for my half. Just let it be... Just let it be the first gift for the girl that I like. Actually… Don't run that way. Kitty, come over here. Come here. Come, come. Come here. Come here. Come to me. Don't be scared. It's fine. Let's go eat. Kitty, sorry to do this to you. Help me out. Sorry to do this. Don't move. Don't run. Actually, I liked you since the first time I met you. But I was too shy to tell you. I didn't mean to lie to you. I just needed an excuse. Enough. Should I let the cat out first? Coming. Here. Let's eat. Hello? What?! The butchers came to take the pigs, and they even took Xiao Dingdang! - What?! - We're coming right now! It's a mistake! They've mistaken! They won't let me in! - Li Xiang, hurry and go save Xiao Dingdang! - Come back, come back. Mister. [Slaughter Room] Is she gone? I don't know. There's nothing alive in there. - I'll go find her. - You can't! - Let go, I want to go save her! - Don't be like this! Don't stop me! Don't hold onto me... - Xiao Dingdang? - Xiao Dingdang! Xiao Dingdang! Sorry, sorry. Thank you so much. I knew it was a mistake when I saw her size. - Thanks. - You're welcome. - It was so close. - Look at her. Look at how happy she is. Let's send her back to the farm. Xiao Dingdang, Xiao Dingdang, I'm wrong! I was joking with you. Xiao Dingdang, slow down, wait for me. Let's go home. Xiao Dingdang, let's go home! Xiao Zha. You've done a great job. Xiao Zha, I think I get it. If you can accept yourself becoming a guide dog, why can't I accept that I am blind? Xiao Zha, thank you. I'm going up. Pull tight! - We've held it tight. - Okay. Don't worry. - Are you holding on? - Yes! Is this spot okay? This spot? Be careful! Chen Leyun, I'm up here! Jiang Nan, come down! - I'm not coming down! It took me so much energy to get up here. Why would I come down now? Then be careful! I'm going to challenge you! Do you hear me? You go ahead and say it! Since kindergarten, you've always been the teacher's favorite student. Do you know how hard it is to be your friend? With my bad grades, I always made you look even better. After carrying it all these years, let me tell you, I've had enough! I'm going to show my true potential during this exam! So I'm challenging you, Chen Leyun, the best student of our grade. Don't you dare run! Don't make it too easy for me, you hear that? Okay! Didn't you said you are going to let the world see you. So you must not give up. No matter what happens, just keep going! Don't you still have me? Let's... Let's set a small goal. I want you to attend the same high school as me. The same university as me and stay friends forever. I will always be your eyes but you have to protect me like your own eyes. What did you say? What did you say? I hope we can still attend the same high school. The same university. I hope I can always protect you like how I protect my eyes in the future. Okay! I promise you! Then I'm coming down now! Let's talk down there! - Jiang Nan! - What? I understood it! I know, I know. I'm going down now. Jiang Nan! What? You have to work hard, too! Okay, okay. Jiang Nan! Are you done yet? It's scary up here! I'm sorry! You worked so hard to train Xiao Zha, yet I said all those mean things to you. I'm sorry! I didn't come to say goodbye when you moved, I shouldn't have let you down. I'm sorry! Also, I didn't reply to your messages either. - I'm so… - Stop yelling, I came down! I'll forgive you since you're just a brat. I forgave you already. I understood what you've said. I will be brave. Thank you, Jiang Nan. Hao Qi, so annoying. Don't. It's all your saliva, all over the place. Did you forget the rules? Mom has makeup on, no licking. Whiny doggy. Mom is going to work, Hao Qi. Be good, stay home and wait for mom, okay? Wait for me. Good boy. Hao Qi, how about this? Kiss me, I didn't put on makeup. Come back early after work today, my last flight now lands at 9:30. Who loves me the most? Hao Qi, who loves me the most? Hao Qi, who loves me the most? Who loves me the most? Hao Qi, you're amazing. You can never forget this, do you hear me? Who loves me the most? [International & Hong Kong/Macao/Taiwan Departure] Angela. This is the paperwork. Please take the animal out. Come, Hulu, let dad hug you a bit more, okay? Don't be scared. Hulu, you're going to the US with your sister soon. You must be good. Be obedient. She will love you. Remember, you're not Hulu anymore after going through security. You're Angela. Remember that. Remember that. Angela. I'm leaving now. Bye bye. Go home, we'll call you when we land. Angela, we are going to the US with me. Mengmeng, this is from your dad. He asked me to give it to you when we're inside the airport. What is this? [Allergy] Dear daughter, although dad doesn't want to lose Hulu, but I'm more scared of losing you. Dad loves you. [Mu Ziyang KWIN] Big dumb dad, we had a deal, why didn't you keep Hulu with you? Is your daughter an unreasonable person? My daughter doesn't need to be reasonable with dad. Aren't you pretty good at coaxing daughters? Listen to me, about that thing that makes you very sad, dad apologizes to you. It was me who brought out divorce to your mom first. It's also me who told her not to tell you. Sorry. Big dumb dad. Take good care of Hulu. I'm back, baby. Hao Qi! Be careful! - Here. Slowly. - Okay. Prepare epinephrine, 0.3ml, now. Where's Fang Xin? Hello, welcome aboard, this way, please. Hello. Passengers are boarding here but it might be delayed. Honey, I don't think Hao Qi can make it. What should I do? Honey? Listen to the vet. If the vet has any suggestions, you make the decision, hubby. I have to hang up. Sir, what can I help you with? He's in a lot of pain right now. Our suggestion is... How much longer can he hold on? When will Fang Xin be back? Her flight hasn't taken off yet. Lie down, lie down. [Hao Qi is holding on for you, can you video call?] [No.] [The vet said he's in a lot of pain.] [Don't wait for me.] [Loving Care International Pet Medical Hospital] Hao Qi. Mom is on the plane. She might not be able to be back in time to see you. You’ve worked hard holding on for so long. Why don’t you sleep for a while? Sleep for a while. You’ve worked well. Brother, let me tell you a secret. My butt is still hurting since you bit on it. It hurts so much. Your mom always said we look alike. I don't understand so I keep saying how do we look alike? You're much more handsome than me, right? You sure are more handsome than me. You've protected her very well. You've been very loyal. It will be fine. Give your mission to me. I‘ll be loyal just like you. You don’t need to worry. She will not get hurt. Brother, you can go at ease. Take it away. Let's go. Let’s find a way to save Barton. The best place for our plan is right here, area A. It's easy to set a trap. So, the most important thing is to block all the routes he can escape from. Do you all understand? I will talk to the residents' association and get their support. We don't have enough hands. This is not a problem, I'll take care of it. A De, you might be able to use this while catching Barton. But you should know, if you trick him this once, he might never forgive you. I've never had a pet before. I always thought raising things like that is very troublesome. But after I met Barton, I realized that I was wrong. It's not me taking care of him, it's him taking care of me. I'm alone here, Barton is the only one that takes me around with him. As long as he can live well, it's fine if he ignores me in the future. Dogs would definitely forgive you. I was so mean to Xiao Zha, but he was never mad at me. Mission failed. That little dog won’t come anymore. Wait a bit more. I can feel him watching me. He will definitely appear. So your name is Barton? They scared you the other day, right? They really are not bad people. I've been lost for a while now, what took you so long? Building A8, do you know where it is? We're coming. Go, go, go. Barton, I really like you, and I really want to be your owner. But this time, you must forgive me. - This way! - Here, here, here! It’s here! - Barton! Barton! - It will scare him if there’s too many people! Over there! Split up, over there! Hurry, hurry! He ran away! Barton, no more running. They don’t want to hurt you. Barton, trust me. We’re not running anymore, okay? Hello, Barton. Bye bye, Barton. [Adoring] Starting. Thank you. Very good. Let me tell you. Talk with me. Let’s talk. I have an urgent mission from my job. Help me take care of this. What are you doing? What— - Xiao Zha, Xiao Zha. - Back up, back, back. Good! Back up, back up! - Back up! - Don’t move! Honey, I’m back. Hao Qi! - Get down! Get down! - Come out, Honey! Wait. Let’s do it again. Good! That’s it! Good! - Alrighty. Pick it up! Pick it up, Benny. Pick it up! - Benny! Oh no, he dropped it. There. What are you doing? Open your mouth! You really opened your mouth? Hao Qi! Hao Qi! Come on. Look at me. Hey, come on. You must believe that my love for your mom is real. - Come! - Okay! Hey, don’t leave yet.
