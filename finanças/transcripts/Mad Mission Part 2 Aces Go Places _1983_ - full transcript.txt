Okay, you can carry on! Mr. Albert au, will you take miss Nancy ho as you wife? Will you or won't you? Hold on, what did you say? I asked you whether you're going to help me. Well, will you or won't you? Of course not! What did you say? It's got nothing to do with me. Sir, that guy up there robbed the bank. I'm in trouble, I've got to go now. Really? Sorry - yes! We've chased you here, bye, I'm off! Get him, don't let him get away! Darling, please! Let's talk about how to help king Kong out... Baldy, come over here! To our room? Coming...! No way. If you wanna marry me, make sure that between you and me, king Kong would have to get lost! He's not just a pal, he's like a brother to me! Which is more important: Your wife or brother? It's different, a brother is part of you. What about a wife? She's like chicken congee. What? You never heard that before? It goes like this: Wifey is like chicken congee, much nicey before eating too much eating becomes plain congee. What plain congee? Tasteless and boring! Who taught you this? King Kong of course! That's a bit much. And disrupting our wedding too! I'll shoot him on sight. Yes, I'll do that when I see him. Where are you going? To take a shower! "Ebony & ivory, live together in perfect Harmony..." What's the matter? You're done! Nancy said she'll shoot you on sight. Why? I told her the chicken congee story. You really got me into trouble this time! Why are you yelling? I'm singing, "jingle bells...!" Sing "ebony and lvory!" "Ebony & ivory, live together in perfect Harmony..." What are you doing? I'm talking my shower. With your clothes on? Yeah, I wanna clean them too. What's that in your hands? One of the holes is stnck. Go out. You make me feel embarrassed. She's gone out, get dressed and go. What song did I sing? "Jungle bells!" No, should be "ebony and lvory!" Yeah, "ebony and lvory!" What are you doing? Combing my hair, of course! I lost so much hair recently, let's go! Who went in? Me of course. What are you doing in there? Taking a shower. You can't do that! Why not? You can do it, so why can't I? Don't take off you clothes! You kidding? How can I take a shower with my clothes on? Oh my god! King Kong, close your eyes! What are you doing now? Taking off my clothes! Oh no, king Kong will see everything! Were you peeped by king Kong? How do you know? I told him to hide inside. Let him take a look, draling! How can you do that? I'm your wife! True, you're for my eyes only. Were you undressed? Of course, I took of 2 buttons! One, two, oh no! King Kong, you sonofabitch, come out! What have you got to say for yourself? Don't get mad, I didn't see anything! I closed my eyes! She took off 3 buttons, so you saw everything! Not so many, only 2! How do you know? I saw it with my own eyes. I think that's the end of our friendship. I mean 2 sleeve buttons only! Even worse. The most attractive part of my wife's body is her pair of hands, and you saw it all! A duel! What are you going to use? Me? A gun of course! Come on, I'll fire if you dare move. I hate men in skirts anyway! So you're bound to win? Of course! Baldy, it's not fair. I can't help it! It's not fair for me to marry you, it't not fair to leave king Kong helpness! What's he to you that you're helping him? What did I say wrong? How dare you say such a thing? He told me to. It's my fault! It's my fault that. Baldy has become so cheeky. I stopped your wonderful wedding, I should bear all the responsibilities it's my fault that you're fighting. I'm leaving! If you have time, do drop by the prision to say hello. Wait a minute, I'm going with you. A friend in need is a friend indeen. If I don't help you, who will? Let's go! Stop, come back! How can you make it without my help? To find out who set king Kong up, we have to find squealie. That informer? How do you know he'd be here? He comes here every night. So many cars here, how do we start? Don't worry, wher I shout, he'll come out. Squealie! What's going on? Don't run away! Stay where you are! Okay...! What are you looking at? Okay, I'll give you all the information you need. What information? 3 clue, 1 genuine, 1 false, 1 complimentary. Go ahead! Some jerk was set up by a girl, that's genuine. What a great way to be set up! What else have you got? The second one is false. You're supposed to marry baide, but everything's mossed up. Now everybody is saying that nobody is marrying you. Shut up, you didn't even turn up at my wedding. And no wedding present other! That's why the third on is complimentary. What's complimentary? Gossip! After all, that's my business. Go on, I love gossip. Who is it about? You of course! Actually, baldy is real playboy. He fooled around a lot in the states. Once he even went with a black girl! You sonofabitch, that's a lie! I have evidence, look at this photo. Baldy! You wanna sneak off. I come here, explain yourself. I'm busy! Are you coming? Yes, right away, I'll explain. Here I am.. I who masterminded the robbery? Who are you? I'm the dumb jerk! Since you're so frank, I'll tell you. It's a fast growing, local gang, headed by a brother and a sister known as bull and juju. Where do they live? That doesn't work! Of course, yours never do. So what shall we do? We have to beat about the bush, the surround them. I'll be ready at the door. While you break in through the window. When everybody's attentionis on you. I'll break in through the door. This way, we'll get them all! Smart guy! In 3 minutes time, we'll start. This is for real! Over there! 1st floor! 2nd floor! 3rd floor! 4th floor! 5th floor! Right!

Drop your guns! Where's your boss? Tell him to come out right away! Where have you been? The rope wasn't long enough, ended on the 6th floor! Gosh, can't you be more... Who is she? The one who set me up for the bank job! King Kong, I'm sorry, my brother forced me to. I knew it! Don't take this, it's poisonous! Keep your hands off! Have you two had enough fun? If so, please sit down and let's talk! Ho asked us to sit down, that's a good start! I have nothing against you, why did you set me up? Don't get me worng, I just wanna be riends with you. And work with you on a deal! What deal? It's simple! I'm going to buy some diamnonds from an American group. And I'd like you two to negotiate with them. That's legal enough, why do you need us? Because there's a small problem. What sort of problem the money we're going to use is counterfeit! That means we'll be doomed? That's the problem! No problem, whom do we deal with? Black gloves! That's a problem! Why? The problem is they don't know me! Who are you? I'm the internationally acclaimed sleuth baldy! I'll give you 3 minutes to disarm yourselves, and be arrested, or else...! Or else what...? Or else nothing? Sit down! Don't push him too far! Go away! Don't touch her, or else... Or else what? Or else nothing! Sit down! Will you take up this job? Not! Yes yes no way! No why...! How can that be...? We're back again! Have you made up your mind? Yes Let me do it! Herel get in, they're approaching! You drive. Why should I get into your car? Look! They're over there, hurry! Stop! Don't stay right there. I have an interesting question for you. Why is your brother Chinese and you eurasian? Same father, different mothers? Or same mother, different fathers? Answer me! Don't spoil the atmosphere! From your eyes, I can tell you're a baddie. Let me take a look. Don't touch her! One eye is good and the other isn't. What pertume do you use? Smells good though. She didn't use any, that's me you're smelling. I like your lipsticks, taste good? Let me taste it. She won't let me. Go away, get the car going!
