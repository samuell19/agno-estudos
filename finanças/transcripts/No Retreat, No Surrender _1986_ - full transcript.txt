This isn't Bruce Lee's jeet kune do. It's karate! Now get with the program, okay? Yes, Sensei. Okay. Everybody continue! Bow! Dismissed. Okay, okay, okay. Did you think over our proposal, Mr. Stillwell? Yes, I did. And I'm sorry you came all the way from New York... for nothing. Now, I don't want to waste anymore of your time. - Meaning? - Meaning... I must decline your offer. If money's the problem... things can be worked out. That's not it. I won't join... your organization. And my superiors will be quite insulted. I understood I had a choice in the matter. Are you that naive, Mr. Stillwell? Now you force my hand. An example must be made. You see. This will solve nothing. Perhaps it'll prove instructive for others with the same ideas? I will not fight! So be it. Karate is not to be used aggressively. Ow God! Dad! Dad! You bastards! We'll be back with the contract, Mr. Stillwell. Until then, get some rest. Jason! Jason! Jason! Dad, are you okay? I think my leg is broken. - We'll get them. We'll make them pay. - No, Jason! It's over. Fighting them is not the answer. What is the answer? This is it, ladies and gentlemen. Last stop! Yes, ma'am! Here we go, sir. Let me help you with that. That's it. Alright. Jason, quit screwing around and get to work. Jason. - Come here and help me with these things. - Okay! - I'll get these. - Get the big ones. Okay. Great! Yes! Yes. Check me out, dude. Looking good. - Hey, nice moves. - Hey, thanks. - My name's R.J. How you doing? - Hi. Jason. What's R.J. stand for? Rayford Jefferson Madison the III. - Wow, no wonder you use R.J. - Yeah. You moving in? No, we just came for the weekend. We travel light. That's good. I was afraid the property values were going down. Phew. I'll tell my dad not to worry. Uh, can I give you a hand with any of this? Yeah, sure. We can always use some help. - Don't expect to get paid much, though. - No sweat. I'll just have my accountant bill you. Hey dude, remind me next time not to let up my services so fast, alright. Bruce Lee freak. Just what Kingswood needs. Why me? Yes! Yo, Jace, check me out! Yes, "float like a butter fly, sting like a bee!" No, no, no, that's not how you do it. Dodge it. Again! Woo! Ha! That's not even hard. Look at you. Aren't you just so embarrassed? Again! Whoa! You get kissed. Come ov... c'mon over here and I'll show you something else, alright? Yeah. Hey, what is this? It's a wooden man and see it's for like blocking and punching techniques. Watch. Aw! Is that it? I can do better than that. Watch this. Well, I dance a bit and I'm really quick. I rock to the beat so basically while you go imitating Bruce Lee. I like to feel my highs, I like to feel my lows. Rawry, ro-ro-rock, try to kick 'em with your toes. I'll do it for you now and I'll show you how. I'll rock to the beat so watch my feet. Alright! Wait! Not bad! Hey, ain't no shelf made to mess up this dancin' machine. What gives anyway? - Oh, you know, old houses and all. - Yeah. - Hey, how long you been doin' it? - Karate? About three years. Oh, then you must be pretty good, huh? I got some friends who've been doing it for about two years... and one's even a second degree black belt. - Uh, I'm not a black belt yet. What are you in, a special slow learners program, or what? No. But, some day I'm going to be just like him. Hey, I hear he's buried in Seattle. Do you know where? - Yeah! I'll take you there tomorrow. - Alright! My name is Jason Stillwell and I just moved here from Los Angeles. I'm a martial artist too, and... I wanna be like you some day. I practice what you teach and I've read everything about you. Please give me the courage and strength to stand up for what I believe. Thank you, Sensei Lee. Alright, alright, alright. Dig in. Eat till it hurts. It's on me. Thanks for the lunch, Scott. This is great. Yeah. - Yeah. - This is great. No problem. Stick with me kids. You'll never go hungry. That was a rough one. What's the matter, Scott? It's that slime ball, R.J. Hey, Scott. Why do you hate that kid so much? I've got my reasons. Come here. Just keep him from going anywhere. That's all I ask. Alright. Well, peewee. Looks like you don't have anywhere else to run. Do ya? Yeah, it does look that way. Get him! You! Get him! You scared, punk? You better be. 'Cause you got nowhere else to run. - Jace. - Hey, R.J. Who's the lard ass? Beat it, Brucie. Go on home and play with your wooden dolly. Take a walk, fat boy. You stay out of this or you're going to get hurt. This is between him and me. Get him! Alright. No retreat. No surrender. Hey, guys, break it up. Break it up. You better be glad the scheme paid off, Brucie! Next time I'm gonna kill you! ...fight fans. We've seen some fade action here. As we go on to round 7 of the U.S. National Karate Championship. Seattle's Ian Riley dominated this match from the beginning. And there's the bell! And Riley storms out! With punch after punch, and another flurry of punches! There's a side kick to the face, and another flurry of punches. He's like a whirlwind in there! He tries to get a punch in there... The referee is calling the fight. It's all over. And Ian Riley is the new... Hey, Jace, check this out. Ian, congratulations. Absolutely great match. You were fantastic. Thank you very much... You know, that guy's place is around here. - Yeah? You know where? - Sure, I go by there all the time. - You wanna go? - Yeah, you bet. We could check it out. Look at these trophies. Hi, can I help you? Yeah, I was, uh, thinking about joining. Um, what do I do? - Do you want to sit down? - Sure. All you have to do is fill out these applications for me and I'll let you speak with the Sensei. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Hey, yo, you need any help spelling your name? Finished? Yeah. Huh. Jason Stillwell. Where'd you study in Los Angeles? - Uh, Sherman Oaks Karate. - Did you bring your gear? Yeah, all set. Good, because we have a class starting in a few minutes. That way you can take the class, give it a try, and make a decision. - Sounds fair. - Alright. Right this way. That's him. Yeah, that's Sensei. He just took first at the nationals. Yeah, I saw that on T.V. That's why he's not doing this. That's why I am. I'm Dean Ramsay, assistant instructor. Hi. Alright, follow me. I'll show you the locker room. There's the lockers. Just go change into your gi. Class starts in about ten minutes. That way, you know, you can get some warm up in before that. - Okay, thanks. - Alright. Not bad. Not bad at all. Yeah, this is a nice dojo. I'll probably join. Hey, I told you. R.J. always knows where to go. Excuse me, Dean. - Can we talk? - Sure, Scott. What's up? Who was that guy? My new student. Why? - Did he say he was from L.A.? - Yeah, so what? I had a run-in with that guy. Did this. And this. And that. What'd you fight about? Oh, well, um he was... talking about how bad Seattle karate is. Yeah. What? Yeah, he was, he was putting Seattle karate down in a big way. And, uh... talking about how wonderful Los Angeles karate is. Then he started, uh... pushing me around and stuff. - And then the fight started? Yep. Now, I didn't want to fight. But, you know, what was I supposed to do? He's pretty good, but he uh... fights dirty. Frank. Come here. - Feel like a little kumite? - Sure, I'm always ready to fight. Good. There's a good fighter here from L.A. He wants to fight our best people. You're our best. Remember though, he's good. If you relax at all he'll eat you up. Eat me up? - Okay. - Don't worry. I'm nobody's lunch. Alright. Let's bring it in. Form a circle by the ring right now. Down. Class, we have with us today a distinguished visitor. And he wants to see... Hey! What Seattle karate's about. Scott. So I thought we might give him a taste of it. Look look, I'm... No excuses here, mister. You're in the ring. Let's see what you're made of. Frank. Up. To the line. To the line. Class, back. Bow to me. Bow to each other. Fighting stances. C'mon Frank. C'mon Frank. Let's do it Frank. C'mon Frank, c'mon Frank. Let's do it, Frank. C'mon Frank. Get up. C'mon. Get up. So, this is L.A. karate. Fight! - But, Dean. - What are you afraid of? Fight! No, Jace, stop! Later, bro. L.A. karate. I'm impressed. Hey, I know of another school, and it's not too far... I don't want to talk about it right now. That's cool. Aw shit, that's the last thing I need. What's that? Some bitchy friend of my mom's. I never get any peace. Man, come in please. Just for a little bit. That way I'll have a reason for not staying and talking with them. - Alright. But I can't stay that long. - Just long enough, alright? Be real quiet now. - Jason! - Mom. - Hi R.J. - Hi. Jason, you'll never guess who came to see us today. Mom, I really don't feel like talking to anybody right now, ok? Oh, but you don't even know who it is yet. Oh, well R.J. and I were gonna... Jason Andrew Stillwell, you get in there. Where are your manners? You get in there right now. Ok. I'm not gonna like it. Kelly! Jason! I've been trying to cheer this boy up all day. And now he smiles. - When did you get back? - Late last night. I thought I'd come over and surprise you. Ah, young love. It makes me wish I was 20 years younger. Well I better go to... I gotta bunch of girls just waiting for me. Hey! Get me another beer. Hurry up! Coming right up. No, no, no. Bring it over here. Come on! Come on! What took ya, boy?! I'm sorry I took so long. What's this I hear, you used to teach karate. Look, I don't want any trouble. Then answer my question. What are you, a black belt? No. No I'm not. Now look, I gotta get back, so... You'll go when I say you can go, karate man, and no sooner. Got that? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Clean yourself up. You're a mess. That's a good boy. Get back here. Hey! Get back here! Don't you ever come back. I'm gonna be back, and I'll get you. Alright! Cannon ball! Alright! Who peed in the pool? Hi, Kelly. Are you having a good time? I sure am. It's going to be a great party. Bitchin'. I think it'll be... awesome. Can't you talk like a human being, Dean? Kelly. Don't fight it. It's bigger than the both of us. The only thing bigger than the both of us is your ego. I'm not interested. Go find some other girl to pest. - You're the only one I want to pest. - Give me a break! Kelly! Kelly! Happy Birthday. How's my little sister? - Think of the stories. - Congratulations, Ian. - How's it going guys? - Sensei. - Good to see you. - Congrats. - Sensei. - Thanks a lot. Boy, everything went great. Any problems while I was gone? Nothing I couldn't handle. Jason! I'm so glad you came. I wouldn't have missed it for the world. Happy Birthday. Come on in. Nice house. Oh oh! I hope you like it. Oh, he's so cute! How did you know? You made such a fuss over it at the pet store the other day, I just had to get it. He's perfect. It is a "he", isn't it? I don't know. I didn't look, but I think so. You're so adorable. I'm going to love you to death. Thank you, Jason. Oh. Oh, he's so adorable. He's so cute. - Who gave it to you? - Jason did. He's a friend of mine from Los Angeles. We met last summer. Jason, this is Cindy, Lonnie and Sharon. Girls, this is Jason. - Hi. - Giver of the rabbit. Nice to meet you. - Hi Kell. How's my girl? - What do you think you're doing? Well, well, look at what the cat drug in. - Dean Ramsey, this is Jason. - Yeah, I know. We've met. We're old pals. Aren't we, Jason? How's it going, buddy? What do you guys... Kelly, Kelly, c'mon, come open your presents. C'mon girls. Stay out of the way, punk. She's mine. I didn't see a ring. Did I? Are you thick? Her brother's my Sensei. She's spoken for. By me. - Nobody wants you here. - We'll see about that. And, uh, this guy was walking past and knocked the drink right out of my hand. I was brave. So, is it raining or what? Oh man they're almost out of cake. C'mon. - Just back off, Dean. - Get out of my face. I told you not to stay. Calm down. They're just having a little fun. Stop it, Dean! Don't hurt him! - Hear that, punk? She knows who's the best. - No! Stop it! Get out of here! Jason! Jason, wait for me! Jason, listen to me. I'm sorry. I had no idea! Yeah, right! - You really think I had something... - What am I supposed to think? I didn't know anything. Oh, give it a rest, Kelly. Jason, don't do this! They're out to get me. I don't know why. I... I can't... I can't handle it. I can't seem to get anything right. I'm trying, but everything's going wrong. I try to be like you, and... I can't do it! - Where you been? - Nowhere. - I asked where you were. - And I told you, didn't I? - I'll pretend I didn't hear that. - Suit yourself. I'll pretend I didn't say it. - You've been fighting again. - So what. You know how I feel about fighting. Yeah, I do. You're scared to death of it. Is that what you really think? Maybe if you'd made a stand instead of running away. If you'd been anything but a... Coward! That's it! From now on... the garage is off limits! You can't do that! Can't I? I think you're forgetting whose house this is. It's my house, too! We'll call it your house when you start paying the rent, ok? Until then, you do as I say. Clear? Just leave me alone! Useless junk! Dad! What are you doing? - What should have been done long ago. - Let's go inside and talk, Dad. Please. There's no more to say. Now just get out of the way and you won't get hurt! Don't do that! No! R.J. R.J. R.J.! What the? Jace! What happened to you? Dad trashed out the garage. Everything is in the driveway. Wow. What are you gonna do? Man, I don't know. You got any ideas? Yeah. I know of an empty house near here. We can take the stuff there if you'd like. Ok, but how are we going to get it there? Don't worry. R.J. will provide. You just wait here. That's the last of it. Hey, let's hurry up and get this set up quickly. My old man is gonna be pissed. You go ahead, R.J. I'm going to stick around here for a while. I thought you were staying at my house tonight? Ah, if I don't get home soon, my old man's not only going to be pissed, he'll call the cops. I know what you mean. So, you go on and I'll catch you later. Sounds good to me. - Hey, R.J. - Yo. Thanks. I mean... I hope you don't get into any trouble. Don't worry about me. I can handle. No retreat. No surrender. Who's there? R.J., is that you? You know. You asked me to come. I asked you? Sensei Lee? Lee da Ga, you call me. Shall we begin? Begin? Begin what? Your training. You asked me to help. - I'm ready. I've studied a little. - And? And I haven't been the best of students. I know you can do better. Utilize what's up here... as your way. That's how you win. Come over here. This. Symbol. Is your beginning. You must be as a warrior. The character, Wu, is made up of kua which means violence or force. Plus this character ji, meaning stop. We call it, martial arts. We practice how to stop violence. What you learn from me is for defense only, and should not be misused. That's the idea. It's your move. You don't want to listen, bye. I don't wish revenge. I only want to learn. You must first, watch. Pardon? This cup as you. Possesses all your knowledge. This cup is what I offer. The cup of my knowledge... is more than your cup holds. - No, Lee, the cup. Then... - You can now learn, and you see why? - Yes. Now... get in the stance. First, do front power punch. No. This hand, no power. Think. Hit here. Stand up. Think. Now, what was your mistake? Punch wasn't fast enough? Easy to defend against? Are you asking or are you telling me? - Now, say that to me again. - Not fast enough, easy to defend against. Now. Show me where to improve it. Show you? Hear warrior inside. Move and I'll counter. Think of your technique. Here. I will... is a long move. See? Again. Stop. Know why you've been getting hit? No, Lee da Ga. You lead with your shoulder. And when your shoulder moves, I see it. You be quick and direct. Utilizing chi. The result is power. Chi. Power. Never succeed without a surprise. Your training begins tomorrow. What's wrong? I'm not sure, Lee da Ga. Think about what you are doing. If you want to improve yourself... you must concentrate. That's your strength. I just don't feel... natural. Now, was that natural enough for you? Sure. That's because you didn't think about it. You just react. From now on, be spontaneous. Look, There's Kelly. Hey, what's with you man? There's your lady, and you wanna stand here with me? I don't wanna talk to her. Alright. Everybody get up and dance! Come on, let's dance. Would you like to dance? No thanks. - Come on. - Ok. May I have this dance? I thought you'd never ask. I'm sorry about that day, I was a real jerk. Go on. Well, wait a minute. You're supposed to stop me and say, "No you weren't". But you were a jerk. Yeah, I was. Wasn't I? Was. That's all in the past. Let's just forget about it ok? Sounds good to me. Multiple strikes, takes timing. Are you ready? Why did you get hit? I don't know, I'm just standing here. All these sandbags... are your adversaries. Stand in the center. How. Ready? To fight... effectively, you must empty all yourself. Your eyes... must see, in all directions. Your ears... shall be aware of all sounds. You must learn to feel every movement before it occurs. And be ready to react. Try again. How's that Lee da Ga? Thanks to you. Is that right Lee da Ga? Hey, are you crazy? Faster! Faster! C'mon Jace, man, it's gotta be faster than that. C'mon, keep moving. Faster! Kick me. What now? And this time, I'll kick you. You weren’t ready. Unexpected moves are hard to counter. So they, present worse danger. Pretend I trapped your ankle. That's your adversary. Kick. Hey! Yeah! Karate man. You will never mess with me again. Get out of here! Dad, are you ok? Yeah, I... ah. Dad, there are times when you just have to fight. I'm very proud of you son. Kick it. I'll never be able to hit it. When you think that it will be impossible, you won't hit it. Set the images all in your head. Then, believe in them. And know they can't stopped. Lee da Ga! I did it! Lee da Ga, where are you? I did it. I did it. Hey, R.J., what's our time? Man. Something must be wrong with this watch. C'mon, let's get going. Yeah, right. Is everything set? Yes, sir. He jumped at the chance to settle this with a team fight. He wants a piece of us badly. Fine. Fine. Our ad will be in every paper. Both morning and evening editions. Representatives from print and T.V. will be there and two local radio stations will be covering it live. I hear Mr. Riley and his team are training very hard. - Will there be any problems. - Don't worry. Everything is under control. Seattle is already yours. - They will lose. - Very good. Very good. - Are you guys ready? - Yeah! - We ready. - Good. - Cause the fun's about to begin. - Alright! Yeah! Warm up well, guys. We gotta look good tonight. Don't worry, man, we always look good. Yeah, but just remember if all else fails you got the big man to fall back on. That's it. Everything is set. Ladies and gentlemen.
