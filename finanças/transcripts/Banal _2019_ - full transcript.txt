RSG Release Team Ian. Ian? Ian? Ian! Ian, where are you? What's with you? What was that for? I'm so tired already and you're still jerking around! We're lost and you're still jerking around! Jerk. What's he doing here? Come. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Hurry up. Ignore him. Forget it. Keep walking. That dog is really pissing me off. Ian? Stop it! It's not funny anymore! Ian? C'mon! Ian! Ian! Ian! Okay, we're done. Your reaction paper is due on Thursday. Please switch off the projector. Thea, are you okay? And that's how you do it. Your turn, Larmy. When Maria is around, what do you do? -What do you do? -Then I'll fire an awesome three-pointer! That's for Maria. What about Joanna? Joanna, your... I'll do my awesome layups. Let's pretend I'm Joanna. Defense, defense! -That's how you handle Joanna. -Hey! Can you give us the ball? Bro, he can't hear you over those headphones. I really like your project. Really, sir? I worked very hard on it. Can you pass the ball? Look at the retard. I'll handle it. Richie, do you have it? -Do you have it? -What? Aw, man. Jeez, Richie. That was to improve my grades. -Where are they? -They're with Thea. Usually, they listen to me. -Don't worry, sir. -Sir Reyes. Here's the paper, sir. It is a little late but it's complete. Erika, you're here again? Shall we go now? Let's go. They've been waiting for you. You got your clearance, right? So what else are you doing here? Hey, guys. Looks like you'll be here till morning. Bro! -Can I have this? -Of course. Guys, we're on vacation! I think I'd like to go to places I haven't visited before. So... that's anywhere in Manila? No. Maybe go to my mom's province, Quezon. There's hiking and a pilgrimage in Awanggan. Erika, there's a shrine there to Mother Mary. They say that wishes made to her are granted. -Really? -Yes. Want to go? Let's go! What about us? Guys, it sounds like fun. We can stay overnight and go backpacking! Wait, wait. You? Hiking? C'mon guys, I really want to leave the city! Sure. I'm game! SISTER, I WAS ABLE TO MAKE MAMA DRINK HER MEDICINE. -You game? -Game. Yes! She's right, cheers! What is that? Erika, no. -What? -Why? We're on vacation. -C'mon, just one. -Erika! Erika, don't be a killjoy. C'mon, just one. No one backs out, okay? Don't worry; it's not that far. We'll go hiking, okay? We'll go hiking? Hey, answer me! -Yes. -Okay. Bye. You okay? Was what you said true? That miracles happen to those who climb Awanggan Mountain? Maybe. Don't worry. Whatever happens, I'll help you get the miracle you need. Okay? Go home, okay? Don't worry about it! Go home, okay? Driver, let's go. What's happening? Big sister, it's mama! Erika. Erika. Big sister will handle this. Slowly. What are you feeling? Guys, I read about the mountain we're climbing. It's a sacred place that has shamans, spirits and Tumaw. -Tumaw? -Tumaw? Tumaw. The Philippine version of Bigfoot. Jeez, Mac. You're such a maniac! Hey, that only means big socks. You're the one with the dirty mind here. -Of course not! -You're the bad one. I'm just outspoken. At least, I'm not the unholy saint here. -Who, me? -No, I meant me. Me. Never mind. Don't tell me you believe them. Would an unholy saint defend a new transferee on the first day of sophomore year? -Thank you, Yel. -You're okay? -Okay now? -I'm okay. And you, Richie? What did you bring? -Mac, give it back. -What is this Boy Scout shit? -That's dangerous. -Look at this. -What is that? -Don't mess with it, we might explode here. Put your hands in the air, it's a hold-up! It might fire! So you are afraid. Guys, what should we do now? Let's register first. Erika and I will take care of it. Let's go! The bus made me dizzy. I should have brought my car. -Could you handle a long drive? -Nope. Let's never come back here. They didn't let us climb! What a waste of bus fare. If he got it... Hello, sirs. Good morning! Hello. Good morning, young lady. Are you hikers? -Yes, sir. -Oh, no! Didn't you see those guys? I sent them home. We're closed to hikers. I'm sorry, young lady. Oh, no. Sir, what about our trip? We came all this way. And you didn't give prior notice? We announced it a month ago. Look. Sir, there are only five of us. Your boss doesn't need to know about us. We just can't let you, young miss. I'm sorry. Yel, if it's forbidden, there's nothing we can do. -Let's go. -What's up? He won't let us climb. Sir, maybe you can allow us to climb. You want us to just go back? But we traveled for hours, sir! There's nothing I can do. Sir... Cielo, please accompany these kids. Let's accommodate them. -Captain? -Go with them. Go, go! Alright. But we'll have to take a different route, ma'am. It's longer. Okay, sir. Okay. -Thank you, sir. -You all be careful. Let's go. Take care of them. Let's go. Be careful. Yel, in fairness, it's beautiful! Didn't I tell you it would be? Hey! Sir Cielo, here's the camera. Please press there for a few seconds. -Rich, why don't you do it? -Sir Cielo, please make sure we're all in the shot. -I want to be in the shot. -Let's fix up first. Let's put our bags... Oh we should... Sir Cielo, wait. We're not ready yet. -I'm ever ready. I want to be in front. -Hurry up, please. Ouch! That hurt! Ouch! Let's get going. You wanna see? Sir Cielo. Hey, look at Sir Cielo. -We're gonna get left behind. -Let's go. It's really beautiful here. Let's rest a bit here. There's a comfort room there with clean water. This is the home of Old Lady Daling. She's a spiritist. Daling! -Daling! Daling! -Spirit what? What did he say? A spiritist! As in a psychic! Let's have our fortunes told! I'll follow, guys. Let's go. -I'll go to the comfort room. -I'll go too. -Dear God. -Cielo, what is it? Daling, Captain told me to accompany these kids. Isn't the mountain closed? You know Captain. He has his exceptions. Can we rest for a while here? Of course, have a seat, my children. Good morning, ma'am. The others are using the comfort room. I'll be home soon, Ma. Take your medicine, okay? Another one in four hours. I'll remember. I love you, Ma. You take care. Let's go. Okay. Will I win as batch rep this year? Young lady, my foresight isn't a vote counting machine. And I don't make predictions anymore. It's forbidden. But why? God is dead. If I call Him, someone else might answer! Is that so? Cielo... Don't go up. But we've come this far already. Leave the girls behind. Where you're headed, there's no coming back. What do you mean? Leave now. Let's go. C'mon! Cielo, I'm warning you. Let's go, kids! C'mon! Guys, I think she was just trying to scare us. I know Daling. She wouldn't do that. Guys, wait. I need to pee. Didn't you go to the CR? But I need to pee now. Guys, I just need a minute, okay? Mac, what are you thinking? Chill. This is just dog meat. Only lunatics eat dogs! It's weird. Don't! Old Lady Daling was right. Let's head back. I can bring you until the halfway mark. But I can't go any further. What do we do, guys? Do we go on? Of course we do. I've walked miles already! Maybe Richie is. No, I'm coming with you. Guys, I have a map. We'll reach the peak. Erika? Sir, we're going ahead. How much further? This is hard. I thought we'd be there by now. It will get tougher. That's why this is a shrine for many. Is it true... that the Virgin appears there? That's what they say. This is as far as I go. Alright. Here. You might need this. Nice. Guys, let's go? -You all take care. -Yes, sir. Go straight ahead until you reach the cave. That's the right path. I think we're near. Hey, look. They say that's holy water. And you believe them? You're such a killjoy! What is it? Nothing. It's nothing. Guys, it's the cave Sir Cielo told us about. We're on the right path. Nice, isn't it? I read about this. Those candles were lit by climbers. Those candles were lit by climbers. It's too dark! What if it's dangerous? Maybe we can just go around it. But we can't go back anymore. I'm not going in there! Okay, Thea. Don't worry, you can hold on to me. You can do it. Let's go? Hold on to me. Guys, this looks deep. It looks easy. She's right. Let's go. Rich! Yes, Mac, not so fast. Rich! Rich, are you sure this is the way? Yes. This is what they told us. Mac, do you want this flashlight? No, I'm okay. Thea! Thea! You guys okay? I'm okay. Rich? How much further? Where are they? Rich! -Rich! -The battery died. Let me fix it, Thea. Just wait. -Rich, hurry up! -I'm on it. Rich? Rich! Rich? Rich? Rich, where are you? Erika? Yel, is Thea with you? I lost her. She was just holding on to me. Rich? Rich! Rich! Mac! Richie left me and I saw a woman! I was alone and frightened! Mac, you have to believe me! -I really saw something! -Okay, enough. When we're outside. Believe me! I have to tell the others! Do you know where we're going, Mac? Come on! Didn't I tell you that I saw a woman? And that she was following me? And Rich, didn't you say that you wouldn't let go of me? I didn't know where you went. You were just hallucinating, Thea. No, I was not hallucinating! Thea, it's okay. It's okay. We got out. Guys we have to keep moving. Of course, but I'm not going back in there! We're not going back there. We have to climb to get to the path that leads back down. Let's go. What's that? There are more here. What are they? Maybe... Maybe, they're the markers of climbers. That means the route on the map is correct. Let's keep moving, guys. Let's head north. Didn't we pass here already? Impossible. We've been following the map and we're moving forward. Richie. Are you sure that this is the right way? Mac, I've been following our map. My digicam! Guys, wait. I have to go back for it. No way. There's no time! Maybe it's in your bag? Check your bag. Maybe it's in there. It was just here in my pocket! -I know I put it here! -Guys, we'll go look for it. This won't take long. Just wait here. It was just in here! This way. -I just used it! -This way, Thea. I put it in my pocket! Where did you lose it? I don't know. It was just in my pocket. There! Rich, I found it! Is it working? -Yes, it works. -Let's go. Thea! You okay? There... What? Nothing. What happened to you? Nothing. Are you sure? Mac! Hurry up! What's that? Nothing. They're back. Did you find it? Let's go. Why did we ever come here? -Wasn't this your idea? -No, it was Yel's plan! Yes, but you all agreed to come! But you didn't tell us that it would be this hard! -Well, I had no idea! -Cut it out! I think we're close to the peak. Thea, calm down. You might be having an anxiety attack. My god, Erika! Don't psychologize me, okay? The only reason we're here is because of your pilgrimage... Which could have been anywhere! Thea! That's enough! And you? If you didn't let go of me in the cave, maybe I wouldn't be freaking out! -Thank God for Mac! -Guys, that's enough! It doesn't matter who planned the trip. What's important is that we keep climbing! But how can we go on? Look at all this mud! Just go straight. That's what Mr. Cielo said, right? We're on the right path. Let's keep going. Shit! My shoelace! Wait. Erika! -Mac! -Rich! Wait! Do you hear that? Where's Erika? Mac! -Erika! -Erika! -Erika! -Hold on! -Erika! -Just hold on! -You can do it! -Erika! -Hurry! -C'mon Erika, up! -Erika! -Erika! -You can do it! -Pull! C'mon! Erika! Erika! -Are you okay? -Erika, are you okay? Rich. Good idea. We'll continue tomorrow. Let's go. Yel. You saw her, right? That was nothing. Guys, do you have more food? None left. Okay, I'll just sleep this off. Me too. Rich, what about you? I'll follow later. What happened back there? I don't know. All I know... Is that I was walking. I was looking straight ahead and then, when I took a step... There was nothing there. Good thing... You're still alive. I know. It's true that miracles still happen. By the way... How is your mom? The doctor said it's cancer. I'm here because I need a miracle. Isn't it funny? I joined this trip because of the wish that Yel told me about. I almost died. I almost died because of a wish. I'm such a fool. No, you're not. And you? Do you believe? No. You know, Erika... people, they only see what they want to see. Erika. It's Yel. -How long has she been like this? -I don't know. Yel? -She has a high fever! -She's burning up. Is there any water left? None. But we can get some. Just watch over Yel. Okay. I'll go alone. Mac, don't go alone. That's okay. I'll probably get it done faster by myself anyway. Well then, look after Yel. I'll just get our stuff. Let's go, Thea. Careful. Thea, wait here. I'll go get the water. The current is strong. Please hurry. Thea! You okay? What happened? -Mac? -Mac! What are you doing, Mac? -Mac! Stop it! -Stop it, Mac! Mac! Mac! Thea? Thea? I'll take care of this. What happened? I want to go home. Let's go back. No more bad things will happen to us. We'll protect one another. And remember... We have to continue or we won't be able to go back. I don't want to continue. If it wasn't for your search for a miracle... These bad things wouldn't have happened to us. Don't worry, Thea. We'll reach the peak. What if we don't? What if this is as far as we go? When we were in the cave, I already felt that something was terribly wrong. But no one believed me! You all thought I was just freaking out! You thought I panicked because I was just hallucinating! Erika, you didn't believe me! -I really saw something! -Thea. Enough. Ma? Rich? Mac? Thea? Rich? Mac? Thea? Mac! Thea! Rich? Rich! Rich! What are you doing? Mac? Mac! Thea? Thea? Thea? Thea? Thea. Thea! Thea! Thea, stop it! Thea! Where's Yel? -Yel? -Yel! Yel! -Yel! -Yel! No, Yel. Yel! -Yel! -Yel! She's not here! She's not here, either! Yel! Yel! Remember what I told you about the shaman? I didn't want to believe it... What are you saying, Mac? And you? Didn't you try to hack Thea? What if you did that too? Wait, stop it! None of us is to blame. And none of us knows what happened to Yel! But where is she? Mac! Erika. Let's just go home. Thea, whatever it is we're doing here... We have to continue. We have to get to the top because the way down is on the other side! Let's keep going. -Ma. -Erika. Mac is missing. He might have gone ahead. But Rich, what about Yel? We don't know what happened to her, do we? She might be safe, for all we know. Alright, let's move. We have no choice but to cross here. What is it, Erika? I dreamt about Mama. I was killing her. What does it mean? That the Virgin won't grant my wish? That Mama won't get well? That there are no miracles? What? -Nothing. -I heard you. Is that why you forced us to come here and risk our lives? Just for that miracle cure for your mom? Thea. Erika's mom is sick and she doesn't have much time. At this rate, she'll probably live longer than we will! Thea! Erika, if she's meant to die, she'll die! Why drag us into your foolishness? Thea, stop it! So, I'm wrong again? Fine! You're always taking Erika's side anyway! -I'm not taking anyone's side! -It's always her! We're all friends here! No. I'm the only true friend here! -Thea! -Thea! Thea! Rich, help Thea! Thea! Rich, get Thea! Get her! It's my fault. It's all my fault! You're a fool, Rich! Such a damned fool! -Don't blame yourself. -It's my fault! If I had only accepted what happened to Mama. If I had just accepted that Mama's cancer was terminal. Then none of this would have happened. I won't let any more bad things happen to you, Rich. Stay here. -Rich. -Stay here. Come here! There he is! -Let's go! -What's happening? -Hurry! -Rich! That way! -There they are! -There! Hurry! -What's happening? -I don't know! Hurry, hurry! -There they are! -There! -Hurry! -After them! Faster! Rich! Rich! -Rich, let's go! -Erika, leave me! There! -Go ahead! -No! -I won't leave you! -Don't argue! Go! Where is the girl? What do you want from me? Just kill me and finish this! You brought that girl to the Demon. Let's look for shelter. Hurry, before they arrive! It's almost time. I don't understand. Who are they? The women in white. Aren't they devotees of the Virgin? Devotees, yes. But not of the Virgin. But of the Shamans. They worship the Demon of the mountain. The Tumaw. And they chose your friend... As a sacrifice. We climbed these sacred mountains to save her, but we were too late. Wait. But isn't this the sacred mountain? -Isn't this Awanggan? -No. The Shamans altered the story. The true sacred mountain is over there, across this one. What you are stepping on is the Kalanta. The Demon's lair. All this happened during the age of chaos. Before the start of the Second War. There was a group of women who suffered a great deal. And together, they climbed Kalanta Mountain to save themselves. They sought help from the Tumaw. The Demon of the mountain. When the Tumaw saw the suffering of the women, It gave them power. Your friend will complete the tenth sacrifice demanded by the Tumaw. Together with the tenth sacrifice, they will welcome the new Supreme Leader. And the forces of evil will be multiplied on the earth. When the new Supreme Leader rises, the power of the Shamans will multiply and they will spread their evil beyond Kalanta. We cannot allow the Shamans to obtain more power from the Tumaw! Everyone, get ready! Offer a final prayer! I'm going with you! Do you know what you're saying? We've been battling the Shamans for many years. And we're willing to die to defeat them! What about you? Are you willing? -Let's go! -Please wait. I know what you're thinking. That I can't do it. That I'm not armed. That I'm ignorant. What I do know is that I can't live with the burden of knowing that I could have done something and yet, I didn't. So, I'm going. I will fight for Erika. Yel. Yel, what is this? How could you do this to us? This is my mission. You pretended to be our friend? It was all an act, why? Why, Yel? If I was the only one you needed, why involve the others? But who brought the others along? Wasn't it you? -In your desire for a miracle... -Why me? Erika, among all the people I know, you are the only one who is pure. A living saint, right? And I didn't make a mistake when I chose you. You certainly proved yourself worthy. Erika, there's a shrine there to Mother Mary. They say that wishes made to her are granted. Really? Yes. Wanna go? Don't worry. Whatever happens, I'll help you get the miracle you need. -This is as far as I go. -No way. There's no time! Guys, let's go? What are they? Maybe... Maybe, they're the markers of climbers. Why did we ever come here? -Wasn't this your idea? -No, it was Yel's plan! Yes, but you all agreed to come! Thank you, Yel. No. No! Your beliefs brought you here. And you have proven yourself... A worthy sacrifice for Mother. Mother? The Goddess of the Mountain. The Tumaw. Mother, accept this offering. Fill us with your being. Give us strength and power. Put the torches out! Erika. Rich! Help me! I don't want to die! Erika, this way! Erika. This way! Where do we go? Rich, where are we? I don't know! -Yel? -There's no escaping us. Let Rich go! I'm the one you want, right? -If not... -Erika, no! Erika... if you come with us, we will save your Mama. Erika, don't listen to her! Our Mother is powerful. She can cure any illness. Think about it. Your life, for your Mama's life. Erika, like I told you... I will help you get the miracle you seek. I thought you were my friend! You made me believe! That is why I am giving you this chance. I know you love your Mama. And I know you want this to happen. Don't, Erika! Don't believe her! No. Who do you value more? Erika, never mind me! Never mind me, Erika! Erika, no! Don't, Erika! Erika, don't! Erika! Erika, no! Don't, Erika! Let's end this. Erika. Erika! Erika, let's go! -Yel! -Hurry Erika, let's go! A forest fire is now razing Mt. Awanggan. It reportedly spread from a bonfire that was started by hikers who climbed the mountain. The mountain had been closed but the hikers ignored this and continued climbing it. Now, police are investigating to determine what really happened. We're safe. Ma'am, sir, the ambulance is here. We'll take you to the hospital. Let's go, ma'am. -So, that's where they went? -Yes sir, just search around there. So there are more there? Careful, miss.
