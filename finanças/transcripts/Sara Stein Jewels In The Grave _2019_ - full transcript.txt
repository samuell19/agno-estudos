Half hour is over. -Then get off and run with me. -Not in the mood. Let’s see who’s home first then! That’s rather obvious. See you later. You don’t stand a chance. Yes, my father has been murdered. That’s not fair. But very refined. -Shalom. -Inspector. May I? Yes. How horrible. Chief Inspector Noam Shavit, our best detective. -But-- -I need someone with an open mind… someone who didn’t know him, who’s not affected by his death. Are you sure this is the right case to start my career in Israel with? -There’s nothing to see here. -Yes, but I have to get into my house. -Commissioner. -My condolences. I’m all right. Shalom, Blok. Shalom. So, you’re the German? Yes. Good evening, Commander. And my condolences to you and your colleagues. -Where is he? -In the kitchen. This is Inspector Jakoov Blok. Sara Stein. Has his brother been informed? He’s on his way here from Jerusalem. -What do you want? -Is there a problem? Move along. Don’t trip. Any idea of the time of death? Yes, he died between six and seven o’clock. Who found him? Amir Dawud, a stepson of sorts. He’s downstairs packing his things. What a way to die. He was the best detective I ever had. He changed after Esther’s death, though. He was very bitter. Imagine you had to deal with the loss of Irit? Would you manage, just like that? Yehuda, just a moment. What are we going to do with her? He was married, wasn’t he? Yes. Did you know his wife? Not really. Is that her? Yes, that was Esther. When did she die? 26 days ago. Did you really not know her, or just not really? What’s that? It’s a case we worked on two years ago. We never found the killer, unfortunately. I’ll be out in a minute, Amir. I’ll give you a lift. -Does he have an alibi-- -Look, his foster father just died. But yes, he was at work. Where is he going? I’m taking him to a friend. He can’t exactly stay here now, can he? That Sara Stein, you should have asked me. It’s my department, it was my decision to make. You know why. Blok wasn’t allowed to have anything to do with this case. Do you think the kid knows something? No idea, but I’ll find out. I think it’s wiser to let Ms. Stein run the investigation than some neutral, external person. Yes, I understand. Sara? Sara? Strange. You Berliners don’t know that? When someone dies, you cover their mirror. Yes, I know that. But what kind of a murderer covers the mirror for his victim? I need that on my desk. Come, I’ll take you home. Who is Amir? An Arab. He was in jail. Noam arrested him. -For what? -Car theft. But Noam liked him, helped him during his parole, got him a job. And he was allowed to live with him. Why did he help the kid? I’ve no idea, but Amir came to be like a son to Noam. Nice gloves, by the way. I want to be straight with you. I didn’t ask for your help. I know that. The commissioner speaks highly of you. We’re a good team without you, too. Do you understand? I’ve seen that look before. In Berlin. You’ve seen it before, have you? Or do you mean this one? Or this one? Enjoy it. You have a happy wife. I have my first case after a year at the academy and you have peace. And my piano. Oh, it’s you. This is a surprise. Hello. Sara. Mom has invited us to dinner tomorrow. How lovely to see you. I have to go, I’m afraid. You look different, thinner. Isn’t he taking good care of you? -Sure he is. -We’re looking after each other. Or are you-- No, we’re not pregnant. I wasn’t talking to you. -You’ll be the first to know. -I promise. Would you be a darling and prepare some tzimmes for tomorrow? You know I’m not a good cook and besides, I’m not sure I can come. I’ve got my first case. Not that horrible, local murder? I know, Mom. I thought she’d have time. Be careful out there. -See you, sweetheart. -Bye. Bye, darling. See you. Take care, sweetheart. See you soon. What do you know about Noam’s death? Tzimmes. You should take more care on your bicycle. Maybe you should drive more slowly. Police. I’m allowed to drive fast. And bikes are parked over there. Are they? -Hello, Hanan. -Hello. Okay, you’re all shocked and very angry. So am I. If-- If it were up to me, I’d ask all of Tel Aviv for help. I’d try anything to catch the bastard. But we’ve got to keep our cool, however hard that may be. Please. Hello, I’m Sara Stein. I’m looking for Homicide. -That way. -Thanks. Here. That’s-- Thank you. Sara, come in. Our new colleague, Sara Stein, from Berlin. -Shalom, hi. -Shalom. The commissioner wants Sara and Blok to work together for good reason. We were all too close to Noam to be objective. Sara and Blok are equal partners in this case. How they fill in their roles is up to them. Get to work. See? I’m a policewoman too. Corporal Hanan Chalabi. If you need an interpreter, Hanan speaks Arabic too. Hi, I’m Tali. -Tali Armoza. -Sara. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Don’t worry, they just need to thaw out a bit. Welcome. Thank you. The neighbor told us nothing new. Amir got home at 23:00. Blok already knew that. It seems Noam was forced to open the safe just like in the Rachel Eli case two years ago. Also with a plastic bag? Yes, and also robbery. The victim let the killer in. What was stolen back then? Jewelry worth more than two million shekels. The victim’s husband was a jeweler. The loot was never found. What’s worth stealing from a policeman? It’s solved. I just spoke to Forensics. Two pretty fibers, the same as in the Eli case. What kind of fibers? Tell her. The only evidence of any value found by Forensics were blue fibers from a pullover brand called Dolphin & Shark. It means there’s only one possible suspect: Ilan Katz. Five years for robbery and grievous bodily harm. He worked for a while as Rachel Eli’s gardener. A security camera close by captured him on the night of the murder but we couldn’t prove he did it. He’s a suspect just because he was her gardener? We found his fingerprints in her house. Not hugely unlikely. And what does the plastic bag tell us? Cold blood. This murder was committed by a cold-blooded pro. In two words: Ilan Katz. The plastic bag could mean something else, Blok. Fear of stabbing or strangling someone, of looking into the victim’s eye. That’s a very different killer, maybe one who’d cover a mirror afterwards. Or before the murder. The killer strikes again after two years and wears the same pullover? Noam would have solved the old case maybe by chance, maybe because he was a tough old dog. And where’s Katz? We don’t know. But not at his house, apparently. I’ve been a cop for quite a while too. I know what it’s like to be suddenly forced to work with a stranger. Are we going to manage? Sure. Will you pick me up later on? -Why? -The funeral. I’m not going. Why not? You have to go, people expect you to be there. What’s the matter? May I? Yes. -Tali? -Tali. Tali. Berlin, eh? Tell me something about the city. You tell me something first. What was Noam Shavit like? Noam, eh? Poor guy. He was a workaholic, but he simply adored his beautiful wife. She died of cancer, right? Horrible. And very sad. Noam felt responsible. He’d become a very religious man but even that didn’t help him. He blamed himself for never being home. She was so much younger than he was. It was a real tragedy. THE FUNERAL OF NOAM SHAVIT THURSDAY, 11:00 I remember the inscription on the Unknown Soldier’s gravestone. “Don’t stand by my grave, I am not here. I am not asleep. I am with my fellow soldiers in the battlefields. They are life to me. My death only adds to my responsibility.” I think that these words embody Noam Shavit’s feelings. He was a good man. Hi. Hi. An extraordinary policeman-- The one with his hands in his pockets is his brother Zvi with his wife. I’ve always known Noam-- Did Blok and Noam get along? They had their differences. Noam wasn’t too keen on Russians. -Blok is Russian? -Yes. Well, his family, second generation. I saw the man behind the woman in the wheelchair last night. -Where? -He was at the crime scene. He drove past in a car. Can you find out who he is? Sure. And I want to talk to the rabbi. Fold the flag. Load. Fire. Load. Fire. Load. Fire. -What now? -We’ll wait. I’m afraid-- I’m afraid that we can’t say for sure at the moment. Sara, I’ll be right with you. The suicide yard. They’re not allowed in with the rest of the dead. Would you give me a lift home? Yes. -He’s taking me. -Okay. -See you. -See you. Isn’t it odd that Noam happened to be investigating-- How long ago was it? Two and a half years. …a two-and-a-half-year-old case right now? To be honest, it’s one of the few cases that we never solved. Who knows what goes on in the mind of someone who is grieving? -Good-bye. -Salaam alaykum. Good-bye. Be sure to work on your pizzicato. It’s all in the fingers. See you next week. See you. Bye. They all get along nicely. -Yes, it’s all just communication. -Exactly. -See you. -You did well. Thank you. Hello. We’ll see each other tomorrow. See you tomorrow. Hi. Shalom, David. Shalom. Do you take sugar? -Thanks. -There you go. Do you think that’s a good idea? You’re on probation. Give me a break. You’re getting on my nerves. Don’t you get it? The police are looking for me. But you haven’t done anything, have you? Or did you kill that cop? Do you think I could do such a thing? Hi. Since when have you been hanging out with that Jew? Get out of here, leave us alone. Go on, get out. Why on earth did you leave the cemetery? How do you know Blok? That’s a long story. Yes, and? And nothing. You won’t tell me how you know my colleague? The army. You were a soldier? You told me you didn’t do military service. All right, if you really want to know… he was my commander. David? David? -Hello, Amir. -Hello. What’s the matter? That’s what I was going to ask. What’s the matter with you? What’s the matter with me? -Noam is dead, okay? -Yes, I know. -I understand, but-- -But what? You were already acting strange before he died. You’ve hardly said a word to me. You cry in your sleep, disappear from work… and the night before last-- Hello. Where were you? If Hassim knew, he’d fire you. Then let him fire me. I was booking our flights. I was booking our flights. What’s the matter? I’ve got some news. Shalom. -Here. -Thanks. -Okay, what have you got? -Well-- The man with the woman in the wheelchair at the funeral-- -Yes? -I’ve found the link. His name is Ariel Gutman. The woman is his mother, Ruth Gutman. Rich family. And what’s the link? He was questioned in the Eli case. Why? Because he’d bought a Dolphin & Shark pullover from which we found fibers. But it never led to anything. -Well? -There’s something else. Yes? He didn’t just build Eli’s house but also Noam’s. That’s very interesting. So both Eli and Noam would always have opened the door to him. Well-- -What? -Let’s pay him a visit. I’m allowed to come along? Look at this house. He’s rich. Why would he steal jewelry? Hello. -We’re from the police. -Please, come in. Thank you. Sara Stein, Tel Aviv Homicide. Why do you want to see me? Actually, I’m here to see Mr. Gutman. He’s over there, on the construction site. I’m having a house built for my son. Oh, yes. May I? Why do you want to talk to my son? Just some routine questions. Didn’t you go to school? -The conversion is all wrong. -Mr. Gutman? Use your eyes, your head. It’s wrong. -Mr. Gutman? -Do it again. Mr. Gutman! Has Noam Shavit visited you recently? Why would he do that? Perhaps you’d just answer my question. No. I haven’t seen him since I built his house. And why were you at his funeral yesterday? Out of respect. For Esther. She helped me with a project. She was a translator. It was about contracts with some damn Russians. May I ask exactly what it is you want from me? Do you still wear Dolphin & Shark pullovers? Yes. I’m afraid I have to ask you this: Where were you the night before last between 18:00 and 19:00? I was here. As you can see, I’m very busy here. You know, building a house is very time-consuming. My mother will gladly attest to that. Excuse me. What is it, Blok? Yes. What? You don’t want to know. Ariel. Are you sure? My informer phoned me this morning. He said that when he’s in Tel Aviv, he sometimes stays here. I didn’t know about this hideout. Shalom. Stay out here. Come out. Where’s Sara? Why are you asking me? Hey, that’s enough! I’m arresting you, Ilan. Yes, why? For assaulting a police officer and the suspected murder of Noam Shavit and Rachel Eli. Come on. He said he was unfit to be questioned and the doctor agreed. Well, he had two serious head wounds. Thanks for just now, by the way. I want to talk to Amir. Why now? He was in prison when Ms. Eli was murdered. Yes, I know, but maybe he saw Katz. Where does he live? In Ajami, with a friend. Maybe you’re right about Katz. Maybe you possess that famous, male intuition. But he’s not the type to wear Dolphin & Shark. We found $10,000 in Katz’s apartment. It was quite well-hidden. Where are you going? To the house to look for jewelry. Let’s go. Do you know Ajami? Of course, I grew up there. Don’t turn up there alone. That is not a neighborhood for people like you. People like you aren’t welcome there. They don’t like Hawajat. Hawajat? But I’m not a Muslim. I belong to a completely different community. I’m a Druze. -Are you hungry? -Why? If you want to see Amir, come to our restaurant. -What restaurant? -Where we eat. He works there. Okay. -Let me out here. -I’ll park over there. I’ll go in first, okay? Got it. Keep your mouth shut. Not a word. Don’t worry, I won’t say anything. Commander. Amir Dawud? Let’s talk outside. Do you know this man? Amir, who are they? Sara Stein, Tel Aviv Homicide. And who are you? Yael Kaplan. Did you notice anything odd when you got home the night before last? See anyone you’d never seen there before? I already told Blok and Godin everything. We were here all night. What? He says his boss can confirm it. And you? Can you confirm it too? Why do you ask? Yes, we worked here all day. What did Noam do all day while he was off sick? Mourning his lost wife, mostly. Noam was always very kind to us. He allowed us to meet at his house. Yael and I want to move to Seville. Far away from here. My cousin owns a garage there. I can work and Yael can go to university. Noam wanted us to fare better than himself and Esther. -That you fare better? -Yes. He believed in our love. He even prayed for us. That’s enough, Sara. Can’t you see that he’s through? Go back inside. Maybe Amir knows the murderer and is being threatened. By Katz? He’s in hospital under a heavy guard. -And he doesn’t fit the profile. -Your profile. My preliminary profile, yes. But I checked out his army file. He’s a good shot. He would have used a gun. No, our killer is filled with fear and suppressed anger. Why do you say that? The plastic bag. And what has this got to do with Amir? Amir is hiding something. -What is he hiding? -That’s what I’m going to find out. What’s Hanan doing here? Shouldn’t she be at the station? Corporal Chalabi is my interpreter. Sara, I delegate the tasks around here. Sometimes there’s no other way if you want to get results. You lot and your results. What did his boss Hassim say? Nothing. He wasn’t there that night. Then we only have the alibi that Yael gave Amir. A Jewish girlfriend? What? That’s obvious, isn’t it? Noam wanted them to fare better than him and Esther. What did Yael mean? -I want you to follow him. -Amir? -Yes. Can you do that? -Sure. -I know how too. -But don’t let Godin catch you. Oh, he can forget that. Hello, Weissenberg. Yes. Things are getting out of control. Your import is very ambitious. Maybe you can come over Sunday to Noam’s shivah. What’s this? A minor disagreement. But-- Professional secrecy. You don’t tell me everything, either. Your mother is waiting. Faster. And again. So, how long did it take to make? She spent three hours in the kitchen. Let’s see what you think. Really? Your son is a liar. He bought it and put it in a dish at home. No matter, Miriam made some. She’s a good cook. -David. -Shalom, sister. Sara, Shalom. How are you? Michal, it’s been a long time. -Where’s Avram? -At the doctor’s. He fell from a ladder. My brother-in-law is a builder. We’re renovating. Come and see us. -Yes, I’d like that. -Okay. Who’s this then? Who’s this then? Come on. Where’s the ball? -Yael, please. -What is it? Yael. -Yael, please. -What is it? What? Will I see you later? You’re making me lie to the police. Yael, please don’t leave me. Never. -What happened to your smile? -How do you mean? It’s gone. What a load of crap. Yael. Yael! Shabbat Shalom. -Bravo, maestro. -Thank you. What a wonderful baritone. -May I? -No, no, no. -Sure, he can. -No, don’t do it. -Isn’t he old enough? -You shouldn’t. Shabbat Shalom. Here. When will you catch the killer? Poor Rachel. -Meira. -What? I want to know. It may not be the same killer as two years ago. Sara has just taken over the case. Then we can sleep peacefully again. Eitan, stop it. We’re having dinner. Please, continue. You knew Rachel Eli? Careful, Mom knows almost everyone. Unfortunately, yes. Without me and my friends, you’d stay in your office. Or he might blossom like a desert flower after the rain. Yes, like a cactus. Can you tell me about her? We were friends and had a bridge club. The three suffragettes. We had a wonderful time. We didn’t just play bridge, we also did other things. Tell her about your Las Vegas trip. Be quiet, will you? Don’t talk about work, please. It’s Shabbat Eve. -He’s right. -I’m sorry. Where’s the tzimmes? The tzimmes is right in front of you, darling. Sarale, are you doing all right? Yes. I’m working on a case perfect for a mathematician like you. It’s an equation with a number of unknowns. A solution for a linear system is assigning values to the variables such that all available equations can be solved simultaneously. In most cases, the application of simple math suffices. All you need is the small one times one. You’re a clever girl, you’ll manage. I hope so. Yes. Do you have any sausages? No, but as soon as I do, we’ll meet, like we always do. -It’s our little secret. -And so it will remain. Are you telling tall tales again? Listen, you pimp, I’ve had enough. I’m going to have a coffee, take a shower and get some sleep. I’ll send in Uri. How long have they been in there? Since Katz left hospital. Ivan the Terrible. Ivan? A Russian? Blok? I need the transcript of the interrogation so far. Any news? Guess who was at the restaurant last night? Blok. Blok? I thought he was interrogating Katz? He was only there briefly. It looked like he was threatening Amir somehow. -Hello. -Hello. So this is where you work? Did I really have to come here? Couldn’t we have talked about it last night? I didn’t want Saul to get upset. I have a couple of questions concerning Rachel Eli. Rachel… She was a rather complicated person. We got on very well, but sometimes she was a bit sordid. -Who is that? -Her mother-in-law. Ah, of course. I think I’ll bring mine in too, tomorrow. -Did you have an argument? -No, we never argued. But she and Ruth Gutman did. The three suffragettes. Does she have anything to do with Ariel Gutman? Of course, that’s her son. And what was Rachel’s problem with him? After he built her house, a feud erupted between them over some cracks in a wall. She threatened him with legal action. I think that he hated her. I always warned her, “You’re going too far, Rachel.” -Hate. -No. No. He’s from an old and rather wealthy family. He doesn’t kill people. Are you homesick? May I interrupt? Katz doesn’t have an alibi. He’s lying through his teeth. He says he won the money playing poker. Uri? The transcript. -Come here. -Yep. -Will you take over? -Sure. I know him. He’s a very unpleasant man. How do you know him? I was pruning my roses in the garden. I saw him with that dead policeman. The two of them were standing there, arguing, shouting at each other. When? About two weeks ago. You don’t like me very much, do you? Yes, of course I do. I just think that you’ll never be able to really be happy here. Take care of yourself. Thank you for coming. Avi, you’re here too. A memorial ceremony is always a good time to see people again. Esther’s was just four weeks ago and here we are again. It’s such a shame. Your brother and I lost touch a bit when I moved the company to Jerusalem. I liked Esther very much. What was she like? She was very young and very Russian. She was from St. Petersburg. They honeymooned there. Did they have a happy marriage? Yes, they were a great couple. But then about two years ago, they had a serious crisis. Afterwards, Esther became very ill. But I think that lately, Noam and Esther had become very close again. Excuse me. Zvi, how are you? Mosche, it’s good to see you both. -Your family is well? -Yes, yes. Please, enjoy some food and drink. There’s plenty. Sara, how are you? I’m fine, Commissioner. I’m glad to hear that. I needn’t mention it, I suppose, but we’re like one big family here. Even colleagues in Jerusalem are affected and want to know who did it. Was it Katz? I don’t want to rule him out. You think it wasn’t him. Do you have another lead? A couple of strange clues that don’t make sense. How was Blok’s relationship with Noam? Is that relevant to the case? Under the circumstances, very much so. They met two weeks before Noam died and had a very heated argument. Really? What does Godin say about it? I haven’t mentioned it to him yet. Had you known Noam long? Noam, Godin and I were in the army together. You don’t think that your colleague is a suspect, do you? I don’t believe it. I hope I haven’t made a huge mistake, Sara. Excuse me, please, Commissioner. Shalom. -Shalom. -Shalom. Shalom, Yael. Is this your first shivah? Yes. Why did Amir run from the cemetery? Your parents don’t like him, do they? We had an argument. Amir didn’t want to go to the funeral. Why not? Probably because of my parents. My father hates Amir. We’re not allowed to see each other. Yael, what’s keeping you? Your father is waiting. Hello. -Shalom, Sara. -Shalom. I found this in Esther’s room. Can you translate it? Sure, I’ll send it upstairs to our translation department. We’ve got to go to Jerusalem. Why? Because it’s your job, or did I miss something? A half-dead, small-time drug dealer has after three days finally been able to describe his attacker. The attacker stole $10,000 from him. The night Noam was murdered? The description matches Katz. Blok, could you quickly translate this? He speaks Russian, or at least he says he does. “My darling, how I long to embrace you. I keep thinking of you and our time together, the best time of my life. Please, take care of yourself.” Where did you get this? What? Esther had a lover? Poor Noam. I hadn’t expected that of Esther. Come on, let’s go. This is your case, right? Or only when it’s enjoyable? Go to Jerusalem by yourself. We really should get out of here. Do you really suspect Blok? If Blok was Esther’s lover, and Noam found out and threatened to expose them-- What’s the problem? Being unfaithful isn’t a crime. Everyone at the police station would have been disgusted. The wife of a colleague is taboo. You have to get out of here. No, we’re doing this together. No, we’re not. -Yes? -Get out of there. -What? -Blok is back. -Well, did he see you? -No. Did you find anything? No. And Hanan, next time I give you an order, follow it, okay? Look who’s here. Hello? Hello. The pasta was good. This has to change, Sara. Something about him wasn’t right from the beginning. Blok lied. He said he hardly knew Esther. -And the way he read that letter-- -Turn that off, damn it! I thought I’d never have anything more to do with Blok. I really don’t know what to do now. I’m convinced someone else at the station knows about the affair. Who? My boss. And what’s he doing about it? Apparently, nothing. Then you’re off the hook. He’s probably got a good reason. But maybe he hasn’t. That would be serious. I think somebody wants to talk to you. Give it back to me. It means nothing to you… but to me it means a lot. I can’t do that. I have to take it to Godin. Yes, you could do that but apart from me being transferred, nothing will happen. He knows. You loved her. You have no idea how much. It was just a weekend. Then she fell ill. She no longer dared. She didn’t know what to do. She died of grief. Do you really believe that? I wasn’t even allowed to be there when she died. I had lots of reasons to kill him, but it wasn’t me. It’s all over now. Give my regards to David. One, two-- You can do this. Yes. Maybe we can have pasta tonight? Definitely. See you later. -Shalom. -Shalom. The sausages aren’t kosher. -Hello. -No, no, no! I’m sorry. Where are you from? Berlin. Berlin. I was there just after the Wall came down, “Die Wende” as you call it. Are you religious? No, religion isn’t really my thing. As long as you don’t forget where we are and why. Noam Shavit, did you know him well? I met him only after Esther fell ill. When was that? About two years ago. He was in search of the meaning of life and of Hashem, who created the world. Esther was probably having an affair. Noam and Esther loved each other. They’d never have considered getting a divorce. You mean, he knew about it? Even if he did, I couldn’t tell you. There’s a murderer among us who is also a child of God. Maybe his conscience will bring him to you. Maybe he’s only still out there because your conscience is more important to you than justice. I hate injustice. Good luck. Do they still have that ancient hippopotamus at Berlin Zoo? There are many new ones there now. It wasn’t Katz. The asshole really did rob and almost kill a dealer in Jerusalem that night. The rat is just playing games with us. Jakoov, don’t get so upset. We all make mistakes. At least we’ve got him on robbery and grievous bodily harm. You’re with Homicide, have you forgotten that? It wasn’t Blok. I believe him. Blok. Maybe Noam’s death is linked to Rachel Eli’s after all. But it can’t have been the architect. He doesn’t need jewelry. What if it wasn’t about the jewelry, but a crime of pure hate? Blok couldn’t know. Gutman kept irking him about the cracks in the wall. And that’s a reason to murder her? Don’t forget his mother. You mean that he projected his feelings towards his mother onto her? But then, why Noam? Blok thought that Noam was investigating Katz… but maybe he discovered Gutman’s secret too. But why did Gutman wear the same pullover twice? It makes no sense. I hate that pullover. I have to go back there. Can I come along? I have another present for you. Open it. Really, Mother, this is too much. -What is it? -Open it. Happy birthday. Where did you get this? You killed her. Poor Rachel. That’s her jewelry. What are you suggesting? I opened your safe. You can’t even come up with a sensible combination. I always knew. I hate myself for having looked the other way, but now I’m going to turn you in to the police. -What are you-- -I’m living here with a monster. What are you talking about? About the fact that I’ve had enough of your difficulties and problems. I’m going inside and you’re staying here. All right. -Hello, Ms. Stein. -Hello. What can I do for you? I know I should have phoned but I was in the neighborhood and I thought-- -Yes? -May I come in? But of course. -Thank you. -This way. Is it somebody’s birthday today? Forty-two, not a special one. Congratulations. Thank you. -Would you like a slice of cake? -No, thank you. A drink, perhaps? Juice, or something stronger? Juice would be very nice. Where is your mother? She’s resting. Please, take a seat. It’s nice of you to drop by. You’re a well-known architect. I like the houses you built in Tel Baruch. My in-laws’ house too. My mother-in-law told me that there was some problem with Rachel Eli’s house. Oh, who cares? People like to gossip. But now a toast. To your health, Sara. I can call you Sara, can’t I? Rachel Eli was said to be very dissatisfied. Dissatisfied? I see. What an ignorant bitch. Just like you right now, Sara. Back off. Back off! Come here. Take the gun and wait. Hang in there, help is on its way. What do you want from me? I confessed. Ms. Eli deserved it. I wasn’t to blame for the cracks in her wall. I don’t make mistakes. She said I was incompetent. I had to do it. Do you understand? And Noam Shavit? Did he refuse to let go too? Did he find out you killed her? Noam? What about Noam? I had nothing to do with that. There were no cracks in his-- I’ll tell you why you killed a policeman. Because he got wise to you, you mommy’s boy. And you wanted it to look like Eli’s murder, so we’d look for a robber. So you decided to wear your favorite pullover again. Do you think I’m stupid? Why would I do something like that? What are we doing here? We solved the case. It’s hard to believe how inflated the guy is. He even still had that pullover in his closet. It’s just a matter of time before he confesses to Noam’s murder. The Rachel Eli case. There’s not much here. What’s the point? It’s all in the file. Check this lab report. Hang on. They found five fibers in Ms. Eli’s kitchen. These are just three. Check again. Five. It fits. They found just two at Noam’s house. Never blindly trust the files. Commander? Jakoov, we have a small problem. The fibers from Noam’s house are in fact from the evidence room. Whoever placed them there wants us to think that whoever killed Noam also killed Rachel Eli. You had the information. -Others had it too. -Don’t give me that! We have a witness who saw you arguing with Noam two weeks before his murder. What is this? You’ve got your killer. He didn’t confess to Noam’s murder. What happened? Did he threaten you? Was he going to make sure you got a transfer? Shimon, you were in the army with him. You know full well that he settled things in private. Like you keeping a lid on things. Be quiet, Sara. Did Amir know about the affair? Yes, but I asked him to keep it to himself. You underestimate the seriousness of your situation. Only police have access to the evidence room. And none of us have a motive for this plan except you. That’s what you say. You’re suspended. But make sure you’re available for questioning. Off you go. Jakoov? What? Your gun. Good luck. What? Well? All the evidence points to Blok. But then-- It wasn’t him. What makes you so sure? Firstly, I believe him. Secondly, why would he cover the mirror? Maybe Noam left it covered after Esther’s death. No, definitely not. Mirrors are only left covered for the duration of the shivah, one week. And a religious man like Noam would adhere to a rule like that. What’s the matter? For somebody from Berlin-- Sorry. The only person… who is religious… and who had access to the fibers here… was Noam Shavit. But he can’t have done it himself. Why not? Well, he’d have to be an escape artist. Maybe somebody helped him. No, Amir has an alibi. Yes, provided by his Jewish girlfriend. Sorry. A solution for a linear system is assigning values to variables such that all the equations can be solved simultaneously. That’s the suicide yard. Sara? -Stay here. -What? Shalom. I knew you’d have more questions. Thank you. There’s really only one text about suicide in the Torah, the story of Jonah. The word-- Hey, Yael. How are you doing? Is Amir here? Hello. There’s something I’ve got to tell you. Wait. I’ve got the tickets. I won’t be coming with you. -What? -What? I don’t know what happened the night Noam died but you weren’t at the restaurant. You’ve been keeping the truth from me for days. How am I supposed to trust you? You don’t even trust yourself. I hope you find happiness. Yael, please. Excuse me, I’m looking for the house of Jamal Farid. -Over there. -Thanks. Amir. Hello. I want to talk to Amir. Is he at home? Amir. Amir! The whole time I didn’t understand what happened, but I just visited Noam’s rabbi again and now I know. You gave him an alibi, but you lied. Amir wasn’t at the restaurant all evening the night Noam died. Amir did it out of love for his father. Noam had simply become terribly religious, and when Esther died, he no longer wanted to live. If you commit suicide, then you break religious law and have to be buried outside the cemetery. But Noam wanted to be with Esther in death as well. For that reason, Amir had to help him. Yael, if Amir turns himself in within the next hour, then he’ll be given mitigating circumstances. But if I have to put out a search, then things will be very hard for him. Thanks. He’ll turn up. Sara, these two are here to see you. 17:25. Interrogation of Amir Dawud. Present: The accused, Amir Dawud, Chief Inspector Sara Stein, Commander Shimon Ben Godin. You were a friend, almost like a son. You thought you owed it to him. I went to his house. I was afraid you’d change your mind. He hung a cloth over the mirror. He went into the annex… and he just sat there. Noam wanted me to do it. He said-- He said, “Thank you.” I taped his arms. I fastened the plastic bag over his head. He very quickly started to choke. I just watched. Then he started to fight and then he fell over. Noam killed himself… but you helped him. Noam got hold of the fibers from the pullover to make it look like Rachel Eli’s killer had struck again. We’d never have thought it was you, but he hadn’t reckoned on us catching Gutman after all this time. I don’t understand why he did this to you. How can a father do something like this to his son? The last time Noam was in my office… we laughed together and shared memories of old times. There were no signs whatsoever. If it’s any consolation, Commander… I’m sure Noam would have thought, “Have fun with the Blok case.” By the way, I don’t intend to mention the burglary of Blok’s home to the commissioner. Thank you. My pleasure. He’s not a bad policeman. Does that mean you could keep working with him in future? We’ll see. I’ll be keeping an eye on you, Sara. You should kick it a little harder. Congratulations. It took me a while to properly understand the full story. It really did involve an equation with a number of variables. Give me the sausages while she’s still distracted. This is nothing. I had them with me when I saw the rabbi. Well, then I’m sure they’re kosher now. Do you really think I didn’t see that?
