Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! If I die, never release my Pocong binding. Remember that! Never release my Pocong binding. =Pocong Vs Kuntilanak= Mom? Miss. Your mother is in her room. She said she doesn't want to be bothered. That's weird. She's never been there for ages. Maybe something's happened. -She's meditating. -Okay then. -Can you prepare for my dinner? -Sure. Bring it to my room. So I have to go back by 12:00 AM? Yeah, but with who... ...and where are you going home to? That's called checking in. By the way, you have to get yourself a boyfriend for your birthday. You're 21 years old and you only ever get to first base? Fine, I will start dating tomorrow. -Promise? -I promise. Are you sure? Bye! Okay, bye. Still awake? Yeah, you're a bit noisy. What are you doing? Go back to sleep, Vonny. But... Thank you. -That is so cool. I like it. -Of course. Is that a butterfly? Are you blind? This is a dragon. Well, it looks like a butterfly to me. Next time don't skip biology class... ...so you'll understand how different a butterfly and a dragon. Vonny, we're here! Hi. Can we continue the reading? You said I will get something today, can you tell me what is it? Where did you get that? Black Ink. It's not a really big place, but I can take you someday. How about we go there after the movies? -Sounds great. -Wait. You've promised to read my fortune or I'm not coming. Fine, you want to know your fortune? I sense that... ...you will come with us. We're here, guys. Look. "Black Ink". -Yeah, I didn't see that. -How come you didn't see that? This is it. Black Ink. Come on in. Let's go. Come on in. -Hi, Big! -Hi, Aksa. -You're here to make more tattoo? -No, I brought clients for you. Okay. Go and sit down while you decide. Thank you, man. They look so cool. I want to have one above my vagina. That must be really cool. -But you have to be naked for that. -Of course. And you want to be naked all the time so everyone can see your tattoo? Yeah! Aksa. -What's up, man? -What's up, dude? Girls, this is Marcell. The owner of this place. Hi. This is your type. He's perfect for you. Go ahead and approach him. Hey, are you talking about me? In your dreams, babe. -Please, have a seat. -Okay. -Hi, I'm Marcell. -Ruby. -Hey. -Vonny. Just take it easy, okay? -It's cool. -Look at this... You have to do it, Rika. This is your responsibility. You are Vonny's aunt. Don't you have a heart? She is not ready. Just remember, she is turning 21... ...and you're getting too old. Do it before it's too late! Madam? Madam, I can't open the door! Help me! Madam, I can't open the door! Help me! Madam, I can't open the door! Help me! Thank you, madam. Vonny is everything for me. There are no other person I trust other than you. Remember what I said. You can go now. I don't get it. All I see in your collection is just western horror movies. Don't you like Indonesian horror movies? -Nope. -Why? Bad stories, bad quality, and not even scary. Have you even watched them? No. Then how do you know if it's scary? You haven't watched them. I read some reviews from magazines. None of them are good. Then you have to watch "Jelangkung". The doll is super scary. -Chucky is nothing compared to it. -I don't believe in that kind of thing. I'm serious. You can even collect the other dolls too. Like Kuntilanak, Pocong, Babi Ngepet, Sundel Bolong. -Those things exist? -No. But Jelangkung really exist. I will bring one tomorrow. Aksa, I can see you and Agnes is getting stronger in relationship. But there's another thing. I think there's one more person who likes you. There's this girl... She is around our age and she's also... It's not me. I swear. Well, I used to like him... But not anymore. I swear. That is not me. You're taking this too serious. It doesn't have to be you. It's okay. You can have him after I'm done with him. Okay, now is Marcell's turn. No, I... I think I'll skip this one. I don't really like hearing my own fortune. Come on, man. This is just for fun. I know you're afraid if we see your true colors, right? Here. Go shuffle it. I think you're not concentrating enough. One more time? I think it's me who is not concentrating enough. Why is that? Nothing, I just can't read what the cards are saying. Can you give me your hand? I'd like to read your palm. -The... -The left one. ­Okay. I need to get some drink. Listen, I think Vonny has a crush on you. And I see you like her, too. No way. Don't be ashamed. You can't lie to me. You usually keep it cool, but now you're acting weird. Finally, Marcell falls in love. Are you crazy? Why would I want her anyway? Look at those pictures. It's like a witch family. That's too creepy. I'd rather be single for my entire life. Sorry to make you wait. It's okay. Only Marcell here who can't wait. It's already late. I need to rest. I think you'd better go home. Okay. Good night. Guys, wait! I'm coming with you! Let's go. What are you doing, baby? Show must go on. What is this? If Vonny has Tarot, then I have this. What are you doing with this thing? Relax. Nothing's gonna happen. Trust me. -Guys, come on in. -Okay. I won't have it. I won't have it. Our family is being insulted. You know what you have to do. Jelangkung, Jelangkung, we are having a feast. Come alone and leave alone. Jelangkung, Jelangkung, we are having a feast. Come alone and leave alone. Jelangkung, Jelangkung, we are having a feast. Jelangkung, Jelangkung, we are having a feast. Come alone and leave alone. I think it's just being lazy. Maybe it's out of battery. -What are you talking about? -Okay, I have to go to the toilet. Silly you. Listen, girls. I have to tell you something. Stay away from liquors... ...because those are devil's drink. If you drink those... ...then what will the devil drinks? Aksa, stop joking! I can make a mess in here! Aksa! Hey. Just trust me. If you want it, then shave it. Or leave it long and shaggy. All right, guys. Did you hear a giggle? Or it was you, girls? We were laughing, not giggling. What kind of giggling? Like this? That's Kuntilanak! Did you summon Jelangkung or Kuntilanak? What's the matter, man? Yeah, what's wrong? You look pale. I'm fine. Stop lying to us. What happened? Okay, did any of you prank me? What are you talking about? Did you turn off the lights when I was in the toilet? Of course not! Why, did the lights went out? Are you afraid? Never, I don't believe in those things. Marcell! -Marcell! -Marcell! Marcell! Help me! Tell the Jelangkung to leave! This is not the Jelangkung. The doll is not even moving. A Kuntilanak did this to you! Jelangkung, please come to us and drive the Kuntilanak away! What should we do now? I don't know. I swear. Is it still there? Can you take a peek? Not me! You do it. You said you don't believe in them. Big! I thought you were them. I've never been this happy to see you. What is going on? We were playing Jelangkung and a Kuntilanak came to us. And she threw Marcell all over the place. And then a Pocong showed-up. And that Kuntilanak stop giggling. -Wait a minute. -And then... You're playing Jelangkung without me? You promised to do it with me! This is what happened. Look at what happens now! You should have waited for me. I've known you for very long. I know you're gonna be late. And we didn't expect that Kuntilanak. Yeah, she came alone and kept giggling while she left. I think that Pocong came through that Jelangkung. Because Marcell was kind of summoning it. Is it possible for a Pocong to went inside a Jelangkung? It could be. It's a spirit. They could come if you summoned them. It could be Pocong, Sundel Bolong, or any wandering spirits. Jelangkung is just a medium. All right, listen. I've watched all movies about Jelangkung. The point is, they come alone and leave alone. This thing scared you guys? What are you doing, huh? You're trying to scare my friends? -Begone! -Be careful, Big! You can't do that! You don't know how scary that was. Relax, we're human beings. We're in higher fate than them. Look, nothing will happen. Relax. Begone! See? -Big! -What's going on? -Is it coming? -Big! Jelangkung, leave us alone! Jelangkung, leave us alone! Jelangkung, leave us alone! Jelangkung, leave us alone! You've been watching too much horror movies. You guys are crazy! Jelangkung, leave us alone! That's not funny. I'm gonna kick your butt. I'm sorry. So can you make that Pocong go away? That's easy. All we have to do is put it on the ground. Then you get rid of it, okay? You're the brave one in here. Why me? How about you? You're the coolest guy in here. No, you do it. I'll take you outside. All we have to do is put it on the ground. You don't need to be afraid. It's not funny, guys! Where to put it? It's really not funny. I don't care! Guys! Please, guys! Sorry! This is not funny! Open the door! I'm scared! Guys! No! I won't have that! You can't do that! It's not fair! Can't you see what time we're living right now? How come you still believe in those things? This is hereditary. But this is ridiculously creepy. I've just learned now what are you doing in that room. What is it that you want? -No wonder dad left you. -Vonny... Your dad has nothing to do with this. He's long gone. He didn't know I have a Kuntilanak. Mom, please, why should it come to this? That Kuntilanak has been protecting us all this time. Without her, you may never exist. What do you mean? Our family has always been under her protection. Anyone who tried to mess with our family... ...we will retaliate. -Do you have enemies? -There's always one. Like one of your friends last night. Who was he? He insulted our family. What a brash young man. -You mean, Marcell? -Yes. I was just giving him a lesson to stop his attitude. So it's you who sent that Kuntilanak last night? You can't do that! What's wrong with him? He's a good man. Why did you even send a Kuntilanak? What is wrong with you? "A good man?" You think saying your grandmother a witch is good attitude? Is it polite? He said our family is not even worthy for him. -What does he mean by that? -Stop it, mom! I won't let that happen again! You're crazy! You even sent him a Kuntilanak. -Vonny. -No, I don't want this! Sit down. I'm just trying to protect you. No, you're selfish and only think of yourself! Vonny, you should show some respect! Have you told her yet? I bet you haven't. You're a fool, Rika! You know if that Kuntilanak stops protecting our family... ...then we're all doomed! Darmi! Darmi! Darmi! Bring me my medicine! Darmi! Darmi! Help me... Watch your steps. Okay. You guys be careful. Please take care. Don't worry about us. Stay strong, okay? -I will stay at your place tonight. -Okay. Yeah, if you need anything, just... You don't need to worry, I'm okay. Don't bother worrying about me. My family doesn't deserve someone like you. Let's go. You told her about what I said that night? About that witch thing? Are you crazy? Of course not! Then how does she know about it? That's not important. What important is you have to apologize. -Vonny. -Aunty? When did you arrive? Why aren't you at the funeral? I come for you, not your mother. What is it between you and her? She's gone now. When was the last time you saw her? How many years has it been? Does Rika ever ask you to keep a Kuntilanak? Yes, but I refused. Listen... There are a lot of things you still don't understand. We have been keeping that Kuntilanak... ...since your ancestors, Nyi Soroh. In the colonial era, she wanted to marry a Dutchman, Von Klingen. Nyi Soroh, you should marry me. I refuse to marry you. I don't wanna be your fifth wife. And you choose that Von Klingen over me? Chinese, Javanese, Dutchman what difference does it make? As long as I love him. I, Raden Mas Soekotjo, what more do you want from me? You want to be their minion? If you really do, then I will kill you! Kill me? Then do it! I'd rather die than becoming one of your concubines. I will kill you! I will kill you! I will! What he doesn't know is... ...that Nyi Soroh is keeping a Kuntilanak with her. Later that night, Raden Soekotjo was found dead in his estate. According to his last wish, no one should ever let go of the binding. It's a sign that he is planning to take revenge on her. He will become a wandering spirit. A Pocong. Don't let go the binding. His graveyard is hidden and only his family knows the location. Does it have to do anything with us? That Pocong is still trying... ...to take his revenge on us. He has tried murdering Von Klingen line of descent. But because of that Kuntilanak... ...that Pocong never prevails. A couple of days ago, we were playing Jelangkung. But a Pocong came to us. Do you think... That Pocong is back? Yes, but my friend drove it away. -It's gone now. -Where was it? At Marcell's house. Why is it there? Marcell... What happened? You have a nightmare? I dreamed of being chased by a Pocong. Shit. It was so scary. I still remember its face. Aksa. -Drink that. It's just a dream. -Here. But it felt too real. I think we still have unfinished business... ...with that Jelangkung. Big, what should we do? Hold on, it's already late. -I thought you got the courage. -It's just... I had a dream too last night. Do you want to hear about it? No! This is because you keep talking about that Jelangkung! Open the door. Thanks for staying here with me. I'm so afraid sleeping alone ever since that day. Relax. We can leave the lights on. Nothing happened to you since that incident, right? Then what are you afraid of? Do you think that Pocong can come here? What does he want? A gathering? Stop talking bad about it! Does it has any reason to come here? Maybe to scare me. It's impossible. You don't know that Pocong can stalk you? You want to know how to escape from Pocong? Just run in zig-zag. Pocong moves by hopping, right? I bet he can't chase you that way. Don't you even feel afraid? I don't have time to be afraid. Don't put your body on my face! Okay, we have put our nails and a strand of our hair inside. Now, seven forms of flower. How did you know about this kind of stuff? I got a class about this back on my middle school in Kediri. -Middle school lesson? -First aid lesson. Including how to deal with possession. Because a lot of possession case happened in that school. -So this is an exorcism? -Yes. And not just for Jelangkung. All spirits will walk away. That's great. You sure this will work? No. Of course it will. Darmi? Darmi? Darmi? Can you turn on the fuse? Where is she? Come on. Are you sure this is the place? Why we should we do it near a river? We should drop it at the river. Just trust me. You'll need a running water for this. Repeat after me. Big! Slow down. What are you saying? That's the spell. Just repeat what I said. Don't look behind you. Just repeat what I said. Are you exorcising or summoning? Just repeat what I said. We're done here. Let's go. Don't look behind. Don't run. I said don't run. Don't look behind. Don't run. What? Don't look behind. Don't run! ­Remember, don't run. Aksa! Wait, guys! Wait! ­Hey! Hey! Let's go. -Vonny. -What do you want? Can I come in? Yeah. So? I have to apologize to you. I don't know where you heard that from. I was wrong. I was being a jerk. I just feel awkward when Aksa said that I like you. I've never felt this way before. That's why I tried to act up. I can't lie anymore. I have to apologize to you. I know this is not the right time... ...but I can no longer hide my feelings for you. I'm attracted to you since the day we met. Vonny, I'm sorry. Vonny? -Yeah, Big? -Marcell, help me. What happened? I saw a Pocong. I saw a Pocong. Calm down. Where are you now? I'm at the Black Ink. Please come quickly. Are you serious? I'm in a middle of something right now. I've just peed my pants. -Okay, I'm on my way now. -Be quick. I have to go. There's something I need to do at Black Ink. I've got something for you. -Hope you like it. -Thank you. -Bye. -Bye. -Aunty? -Sit down. Now is the time. Still about that? You know that Pocong is coming. And you know its appearance is no coincidence. Now, if you don't take that Kuntilanak as your guardian... ...who will keep us safe from that Pocong? -Why don't you do it yourself? -Because I can't! It has to be passed down to the next generation. It is you. And then to your daughter, and so on. I won't do that! You're so stubborn! Listen, that Kuntilanak has been keeping our family safe! And you need to know, she can also hold a grudge... ...if we reject her. Don't mess with her! I don't care! I'd rather be killed by her! She will never kill you. She will only hurt your loved ones! Marcell... Marcell... Please pick up the phone. Please pick up the phone, Agnes. What is it? What's taking you so long? You need to come here. I'm so scared. What do you want, Ruby? I'm watching TV. Please, you have to come here. I'm about to cry. You have to come here. What's wrong? There's something in my bathroom. Please come here. Okay, I'm coming. Let me call Aksa to pick me up. ­Bye. I know, I'm on my way. It's me, Vonny. I'm dating Marcell now. -Seriously? -Yeah. He just gave me a present. Gosh, I think I left it at the table. What's the big deal? My aunt is outside. I don't wanna see her. Okay, I have to go Ruby's place. I'll call you later. Bye. You know, Ruby is so clingy. Look who's talking. You mean me too? What does she want? She was calling me non-stop earlier. Now she turned off her phone? -Hello. -Did Ruby call you? No, why? She called and asked me to stay at her place tonight. So? I don't know, I just have a bad feeling. I tried calling her, but she's not picking up. -Are you with someone now? -I'm with Aksa. I'm on my way there. We're going as fast as we can. Okay, I'll call a taxi and meet you there. Okay, see you. Ruby! Ruby. Can you go faster, please? Vonny! What happened to Ruby? Ruby! -What happened to Ruby? -Ruby! Ruby! Ruby, I'm sorry! Come on, pick it up. Yeah? Where have you been? Why didn't you answer my call? Big is gone. He's dead. No way. -Ruby just died, too. -Ruby? Ruby? -What's going on here? -I have no idea. I'm taking Vonny home. I will see you there. I have to take care of Big first. Big is dead. You... Begone! Get away from me! Aunty! Aunty! Vonny? Vonny? Vonny? Let's look upstairs. Vonny? Vonny, where are you? Vonny? -Vonny? -Where are you? Vonny? Vonny? -Babe, get out of here. -No. -What about you? -I said get out of here. No, I don't want to leave you. I said run! I will be right behind you! Hurry! ­Aksa! Vonny! Vonny! Help us! So you're the one who killed my friend? I'm not afraid... Aksa! ­Aksa. Agnes... Agnes. Kuntilanak, you win! I accept you to serve for the Von Klingen family! Now leave! Leave us alone! Agnes! Agnes. Vonny! Vonny! -Vonny! -Marcell! Marcell! Marcell! Marcell! -Marcell! -Vonny! -Vonny! -Marcell! Stay here. Madam had warned me about this. That all of this will happen someday. Only Miss Vonny who still can't control that Kuntilanak. (Klengger Cemetery) Marcell? Your hands is so cold. Answer me! I'm scared! Answer me! Run... Run! I will kill you, Vonny. There will be no Von Klingen left! -Hello. -How is it going? I've dug up some graves, but still no luck. I hope this is the last one. Yes, let's hope that is Soekotjo's grave. -Please, hurry! -Yes. Why the Kuntilanak doesn't help her? I have no idea. I think Miss Vonny doesn't know the spell. Please, you have to fight him! I'm just worried about one thing. If Dharmo found Soekotjo's grave, he must wait before opening the Pocong binding. I'm afraid if he do that now, Marcell will also die. The only way is... ...to release Marcell from that Pocong's grip. Yes, that's it! Miss Agnes? Miss Agnes! -Sir! -What happened? We found it. The binding is still intact. Wait! I can't open it? What if the body wakes up? Just wait! Vonny, Marcell, please stop! You can't hurt each other! We are all friends. You can't let this happen. Stop! I know you care for each other! Please stop! Marcell! Please come to your senses! Fight it! Please! You have to fight it back! Marcell, look! Look at this. This is the ring you gave to Vonny. You gave her this because you love her. Don't you remember this? Come on, wake up! Please, you have to fight it back! Marcell... Now! Release the binding! I'm all right. Let's start a new beginning. Hi, my name is Vonny Von Klingen. I'm Raden Marcell Soekotjo. Let me help you.
