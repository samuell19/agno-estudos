OK, everybody. All on stand-by. We're going to start. Five, four, three... And now: Twitter, a curse or a blessing? Columnist Femke Boot wrote earlier this week... ...that it's about time to put a stop... ...to those online hate messages and death threats aimed at her. Welcome, Femke. What do you think companies like Twitter and Facebook should change? I think we're the ones that have to change. That our culture has to change. These days we think it's so normal that someone else... ...the person we don't agree with, that they are our enemy. And we have to stop doing that, so... Come on, Femke. This is just an old-fashioned campaign for decency. Just a minute. Femke, finish what you were saying. Right. Well, Twitter, Facebook... ...all those comments, it's all so awful. And I think we shouldn't forget, we have to remember... ...that we are all people. Including the people we don't agree with. Yes, and we also shouldn't forget to no longer eat meat. We should recycle our plastic, and to save water... ...we should piss under the shower. Look, why can't we just have different opinions and be nice about it? Rickert: why do we still allow untalented women on TV?? Piepo I hope they rough up your daughter Winter is Coming NL I know where you live THIS SEEMS LIKE A PERFECT MOMENT TO SAY FAREWELL TO THIS FUCKING MEDIUM GOODBYE FOREVER No. No. No. You could have mentioned the book. You're not on a talk show for fun. You're a brand. You could have mentioned the book. -We don't know what the book is yet. Because you haven't handed anything in. -I've handed in a complete book. Yes, and it's a good book, but it's perhaps a little too heavy. Yeah, right. A book about everything that's wrong with society... ...isn't what we want. God forbid that someone learns something. Darling, people love your columns because they are so familiar. Not because you tell them what they should think. Listen, we're talking about next Christmas... ...which is practically this Christmas, which is practically now. There will have to be a bit of a stir about your book, right? Go back. A stir? -Yes. A stir, yes. No. But I don't even know what. We still don't have a title, a subject. We don't even know what kind of book it's going to be. But we do have a target group, right? We have a target group. -Go a bit faster, darling. It's just... I'm suffering a bit from... Don't say 'writer's block'. OK. -Don't say it. I'm saying nothing. -It doesn't exist. OK. Stop. This is getting us nowhere. It's all about the mindset. Herman Brusselmans writes two books a year. Why didn't you ask him to write a book? Don't be so silly, Femke. We want you, Femke. The real Femke. Just you. And Brusselmans is stuck with another publisher until 2022. There's no way of getting him away from them. We've tried, believe me. Have the first part in my mailbox by next week. OK? By next week? -I have to go, sorry. Hey, you just have to get writing, because you're good at it. So, lovely chat, nice people, great coffee. Ciao, ciao. BYE BYE BLACK PETE I have gym class today. Have you washed my kit? Is it any good? -It's really good. He's a really good writer. But apart from that, he's not a nice person. You don't think anyone's nice. -No-one is nice, Anna. No, that's true. NOVEL, ATTEMPT 4 Johan De Gezellige: within three days she'll be back, wanna bet? Noud van Heijst: Her column is a bitter rant from a sexless bitch Wim: that woman really doesn't fucking get it sexually frustrated... not a fuck... gotten fat... fuck face... and stay away. I think, but that's just what I think... ...I just think your women's columns are better. Women's columns. -Just about your divorce and your kid. Just keep it personal. That one about that... -Shewee? Yes, the one about the Shewee. That was nice. That's what I mean. I read that column, because I'm interested in you. Do you know what I mean? There are so many political things where I think, hey, stick to what you know. And we should come back here for late night opening when they serve gin&tonic. Do you know what I think? -What do you think, Renate? If it really was that bad with all those death threats and such... ...you'd have gone to the police and not to a talk show. I mean that in a positive way, you know? It's obviously not that bad. So if I understand you correctly, you are filing a report... About? -Offense, slander... What's it called? -Tweets? And comments, Facebook, things... ...nasty messages, a couple of death wishes. Ms. Boot, you did go to elementary school, didn't you? Yes. -So you know what it's like there? Bullying, stirring up trouble, finger pointing, singing nasty songs. But these aren't children. These are... My advice is to simply not look at these internet websites any more. ...it's just the internet. It's not real. Also, you can decide not to write about Black Pete. That was just one column. That was just one... Ms. Boot, how long have you been at this school? That sounds like asking the obvious to me. Don't use this kind of language at my school, please. Not at our school. What? -Headmaster... ...even for the simple third grade student sitting across from you... ...it's very clear that your problem isn't the language in this piece. Is that right, Anne? Anna. So what is my problem then? -OK, look. You don't want, and I get it... ...you don't want the school paper to say anything about your stupid merger plans. My...? -Stupid merger plans. Hereby, you are immediately thrown off the school newspaper's editorial team. OK. Oh. Hi, neighbor. It's a surprise. Off we go. I understand that you're young... Are you going to rule out my opinion because of my age? What will a benefit event like that generate? Money. For the freedom of expression? What good will money do for that? It's about people in Russia, in Turkey, in the Philippines... ...who risk their lives every time they write some criticism on the internet. It's just so incredibly prissy, Anna. You just don't understand anything. My bike's broken. Can you give me a lift? -On the back of my bike? By car? Is there any bullying at your school? Of course. Not me though. What do you think about it? -It's not nice for those people. They're only words. -Words can also hurt. Yes, but less than stones. -Stones? At elementary school we sometimes used to throw stones at Brian. But Brian was a real little fucker. -Mom. What? -You can't say that. Some people just deserve it. Like Brian. -Mom. It wouldn't surprise me if he was into child porn in 20 years time. Little fucker. There's no fence. Yeah, I'm making a new one. A new fence? -Yes. Great. -Yes. Hard at work? -Yes. Do you think you'll be long... Is everything going all right? -Yes, very good. Look, Fem, of course I'm like: Do I wish it could be different? Of course I wish it could be different, but... Do you know what? It's just shit. Right. That's what it is. Yes. Arjen Tol: St. Nicholas: 'I know where all the naughty girls live' This is just a question of: you just have to accept some things... Arjen Tol: I'm ashamed I live in a country like this Arjen Tol: Close the borders = the only solution Arjen Tol: who wants to fuck this filthy bitch. Fuck her dead maybe? Just a minute, this isn't a medium. Gin & tonic? It's late night opening. So we serve gin & tonic. Thank you. Oh, and one for... Shit. Hello. -Hello, neighbor. Someone has wrecked our fence. Oh, dear. -With an axe or something. How awful. Did you see anything? -No. Oh. Pity. -Yes. What's that? It's ham. We've got a ham left over. Excuse me? -We've got a ham left over. It's a shame to throw it away. Thank you. NOVEL ATTEMPT 9 Arjen Tol: fucking lefty bitch... Islam is Apartheid It will always be h... fucking columnist,! Mom? Hi, sweetheart. Chill. So.

What? -Without the S. Right. Cool poster, though. -Thank you. If you like, I could come and say or do something. Really? Would you really want to? If you want me to. -I'd love that. Good. -Thanks, Mom. And what is this all about? -Freedom of speech. At school? -No, in Turkey, Russia, the Philippines. This isn't about... The school newspaper? No. May I go now? I think I'm allergic to books. Is that possible? How come? -After every book launch... ...the next day, I have a headache. Thank you for the first half, by the way. I really enjoyed... ...reading it. OK. Dear friends, family and competition... You weren't very nice to me, were you? Excuse me? -On TV. Very unkind. I'm afraid that, where TV is concerned, I'm a little more cynical than you. And why aren't I cynical? You were there because you want to change the world. I was there to sell my new book. I was playing a role. -That's no excuse. No. -No. No, I didn't mean it as an excuse. It's not nice, but it's the truth. I'm much more cynical than you. Oh, really? I really don't care about anything at all. Nothing? -Nothing. That is indeed cynical. Pity. My mother does my nails. Really? -My hands shake too much. So every time I have to perform, I call in on Mom. A great excuse to see her more often. Hi. Hello? Hello? -Hi. If you like, you can come and stay over another time. Would you like that? Yes. I would like that, yes. THE JOY OF A SOFT-BOILED EGG Are you really called Steven Death? I'm called Erik Flinterman. I thought it sounded a bit too cheerful for horror stories. Yes, Erik Flinterman writes kids' books. -Picture books. Cook books. ...when it's meant to be? Yeah, I don't know. When you suddenly see a future together. When you want to have someone's kids. When you know that someone still loves you even when your nipples are leaking... THE JOY OF A SOFT-BOILED EGG Jan de Wit: why this kind of trivial rubbish in my paper? Diederik Mathijssen: Keep this fucking cunt to yourselves. Ruben: a tumor is to the brain, as 'Femke Boot' is to journalism Steven van de Ven: What an ugly mug Diederik Mathijssen: Keep this fucking cunt to yourselves, trivial rubbish what an ugly mug women's kollumn Don't read the comments. -No. Never read the comments. -No, no. I know. Diederik Mathijssen: Keep this fucking cunt to yourselves... I'm going to the bathroom. Hi, I'm Diederik. I nominate Robert and Lindsey Stavenuite and Barack Obama. Wash your hands. Femke Boot? -Yes. Hi. Would you like a drink? No, thank you. I'd have worn something else if I'd known you were coming. Really? -Don't you think? You don't seem like the kind of person who takes other people into account. People can surprise you. -I'm often surprised by people. Although it's not often in a positive way. How's Tanja? Tanja? Fine. -Really? Yes. How long have you been together? A year. -A year. Yes. 'I propose that we skewer this woman cunt-first on a pole at the beach...' Nice expression: cunt-first. Thank you. It took me a while to come up with that. I was wondering, if I may ask a question... Go ahead. -Would Tanja like that? If you said something like that about her? -Cunt-first? Skewered on a pole at the beach. Would Tanja like that? That's irrelevant. -Because? I would never write something like that about Tanja. Because Tanja doesn't write such fucking terrible columns. Sorry, Diederik. You called the wrong fucking whore a fucking whore. Have you seen my scarf? FUCK THE KING LONG LIVE FREEDOM OF SPEECH Torture, murder, anal rape. We can't all write about the joy of a hard-boiled egg. Soft-boiled egg. It was a good column. -Thank you. It's just fiction. It's gruesome, but it's all fake. I just make it up. That can't be healthy. Cheese. I think it's very healthy indeed. Everyone has those kinds of thoughts. -Anal rape? Most people don't dare to admit it. They hide their feelings. Maybe. Shall we go out to dinner? I also have a way of letting off steam. -Like what? Well, regular stuff. Video games. Video games? -Yes. Doom and things like that. So I really understand it when you say that everyone has some hate inside them. Hate? And violence and stuff. It just has to be released, one way or another. But that's not what I said. I didn't say I had any hate in me. Well, you know, something like that. -I really didn't. I actually heard you say it exactly like that. That's what you literally said. -Literally? Literally. In words. THEN CAME THE REALIZATION: DEADLINE CHAPTER 3 TODAY ...there have been shocked reactions to yesterday evening's brutal murder. On social media it's being called the frying pan murder. A 28-year-old man was attacked by an intruder in his own home... ...and beaten to death with a frying pan. It's a mystery to the police and no suspect has been arrested yet. It is unclear why the man was a victim. We should thank the murderer. If only because now we get to hear Merel Westrik... ...say the word 'frying pan'. Bosskabouter: Justice will prevail. We all get what we deserve. Jeroen van de Kieboom New Realist. Entrepreneur. Father. I'M JUST GOING TOT GET CHIPS FROM THE ALL-NIGHT STORE, XX F STATE FORESTRY DEPARTMENT Fuck. Sorry. Seriously. Sorry. -What? I didn't mean it. You didn't mean it? -No, really. I didn't mean it. It was just a bit of fun. -A bit of fun? Yes, I know it's not a bit of fun to you. I felt guilty the moment I did it. You mentioned me in a really nasty message yesterday... ...and now all of a sudden you've had a change of heart? Fucking hell, mate. At least the one before you was honest. The one before me? -Yes, you, Jeroen... ...you just say what you think I want to hear. Spineless piece of snot that you are. No, seriously, I just wanted to be part of the crowd. I'm going to improve my life. I'm going to improve my life. I can get rid of Twitter, I can... Do you know what? It isn't hard to be kind. I am kind. Ask everyone who knows me. You're kind? -Yes. Really kind? -Yes. OK. AMSTERDAM MAY HAVE TURNED INTO DISNEYLAND BUT IT'S MY DISNEYLAND Three, two, one. Happy New Year. Where were you? -At Renate's, for a drink. Once she starts talking, there's no stopping her. No way. Are you... What? What? Are you seeing someone else? No. OK. Then I got it wrong. Trust me. Whatever it is, you can tell me. Are you hungry? Now? -Fancy some soup? I'll make some soup. Hate mail. We get six or seven every day. What do they say? -That you're a pedophile. Right, yeah, but I already knew that. They've found an old column you wrote. Something about you being 19 and your boyfriend was 15. 16. -Oh, 16. Jesus. -They threaten us with all sorts. They'll boycott the publishing house until we terminate your contract. Sorry, I don't know what to say. We know you're not a pedophile. You don't have to tell us. They just want to badmouth you. -If you want to terminate my contract... No, no, no. The question is: is it OK with you... ...if we quote a couple of those letters on the back cover. To cause a stir. Hey, what are you doing? A new banner. -Why? The Headmaster didn't like the first one. -Why not? Because it had 'fuck the king' on it. What a prick. -He said it was a punishable offence. But isn't this whole thing about freedom of speech? What a prick. It's no problem. I'll just make a new one. -What a prick. YOU CAN'T SAY FUCK THE KING Very good. -Cool. What a prick. Are you still angry? -I'm not angry. I just think he's a prick. -You've already said that. He's just a prick. Could yoga be something for you? -Give me a break. See you tonight. I love you. What a prick. Mom? The police. Please, take a seat. -Thank you. No, thank you. We've received a phone call that a child is being held hostage in this house. A child? A sex slave. Oh. Yes, no, that's Cornald. My daughter's sex slave. I'm joking. I don't have a sex slave in my cellar. In my house. We also didn't take that call too seriously, but we just wondered... What the hell is going on. Do you have any enemies? Twitter. -Twitter? Yes. An old column I wrote is being used against me to set me up... ...as a pedosexual. Seriously? -Yes. How awful. That must be very annoying. Yes. Yes, it is, yes. Any idea who could be behind this? One of them seems to be the boss. Every time he tweets something, a whole army of trolls follow suit. Do you have a name? -Bosskabouter. Bosskabouter? -Boss... kabouter, with double s. But I don't think it's his real name. That'll be that guy Tarik. Tarik? -That's not what I said. Tarik. -You misheard. We would advise you to stay off Twitter... ...and if you are personally harassed, then this is our direct number. Tarik. -I never said that. Tarik. I'd like to have sex with the king, if he's OK with that. It's my daughter's. A school project. OK. TARIK BOSSKABOUTER TARIK CRIMINAL RECORD Would you like a cup of tea? -Not right now. OK. Sorry. Mom? Do you trust Steven? Yes. Don't you think he's a bit strange? -Of course. That's why I like him. A bit scary? He makes me happy, Anna. That's important to me. I know that having a new man in the family takes some getting used to. But he really is a good one. The police may have made a breakthrough... ...in their investigation into the murder of Peter Kolk from Amsterdam. Kolk was brutally murdered during Carnival weekend. Detectives suspect that there is a link... ...with a number of murders that took place last year. Earlier this week the police announced that in all of these murder cases... ...the victims were mutilated after they were killed. And that is why the murders are now known on social media... ...as the middle finger murders. It is not yet known if Kolk was also mutilated after he was killed. So? So? So, do you want to join us for dinner? Oh. No. Steven and I are having dinner together. GET IN TOUCH WITH US N&DW PUBLISHERS I DON'T LIKE SOUP Treinstein9: during foreplay would Ms. Boot also...

To the shops for the groceries. But, I... -Yeah, for tomorrow. Will you be back in time? -Don't worry. Have you been on Twitter again? Don't do that. They're just a bunch of idiots with delusions of grandeur. Yes. Really. -Yes. I just need to clear my head. Shit. Good evening. This is 'The World Turns' on Monday 18th February... Well, if it isn't Treinstein9. It's time, Arend. For... Yeah, for revenge. I want to see your computer. Where is your computer? Where do you write your goddamn fucking messages? Those uninformed, half-hearted, political analyses. Your death threats. Those funny photoshops of Volkskrant columnists... ...that you portray as cock-sucking whores. Where is your computer? Welcome, everyone. Or should I really say: 'Welcome, motherfuckers'? Why do I say that? Because I'm allowed to. Your mother should be here by now, shouldn't she? Shit. Jeanne, call the police and hide. Arend? So, Femke Shewee, now the roles are reversed. Give that to me, stupid cunt. How dare you... Welcome. Hello. 911. What is your emergency? 911. What is your emergency? Hello? Hello? Shit. Fuck. There you go. Where's Mom? I don't know. She went to do the groceries. -But she has to give a speech. I don't know where she is. Yeah, right. You don't know where she is. Should I maybe read the speech out? -I'll do it. But I want... -No. I asked my mother... ...for those who don't know, my mother is Femke Boot... ...a columnist for the Volkskrant. I asked her to write something for this evening. My mother isn't... unfortunately, she can't be here, but... So, this was written by my mother. When my daughter asked me to write something about freedom of speech... ...I had to laugh. I admit it. The subject felt somewhat old-fashioned. In Holland we have stretched the barriers of what we can say so much. I can write everything I want in my column. If it doesn't get published in the paper... ...it's because my editor didn't think it was good enough. Not because it is subject to censorship. But there are places where people are killed... ...for what they write on the internet. Killed for their words. This happens every day, you know? So what for us is just commonplace, a cliché, a boring truth... ...should be repeated time and time again. Everything can be said. I am allowed to say everything. I am allowed to call the king a prick. The government corrupt, we're allowed to call Neelie Kroes a whore... ...and the Headmaster of my daughter's high school... ...an overpaid, balding piece of shit. That is allowed. No, you have to. And if people don't agree with me, then they are allowed to be angry. They're allowed to curse me, fight against me... ...with every argument that they can come up with. But they aren't allowed to silence me. I'm allowed to say everything. Therefore, no matter how old-fashioned it may be, a toast. Ladies and Gentlemen, to freedom of speech. My car broke down. The car wouldn't start, I waited for the breakdown service for an hour. You hung up on me. You hung up on me. Yes. I hung up on you. Sorry. Sorry, I... Let's talk about this some more in the morning. I'm going to live with Dad. Welcome to Voicemail. You have six new messages. First new message: Hi, Anna. It's me. I know you don't want to talk to me... Next new message: Anna, hi. I'll keep calling until you pick up... Next new message: Darling, tomorrow it's my book launch. I would really love it if you could be there. STEVEN DEATH STEVEN DEATH I KNOW YOUR SECRET!!! Your new column has been well received on Facebook. I don't want to know. Only four haters so far. -I don't want to know. Here. This one is nice. Well, nice... Tarik Bos: Femcunt Clever. Right? Tarik Bos. Yes? OK. I'll put it away. Are you nervous, about the launch? No. Anna. What are you doing here? Big day. I didn't want to miss it. Sweetheart. I know what you do at night. Is this a joke? No, this isn't a joke. STILL NO-ONE ARRESTED FOR THE BATHTUB MURDER Who do you think I am? TARIK BOS 7 WILLEM STREET What are you doing? -I have to think. What about? -About everything. We have to call the police. I accuse you of being a serial killer and you make carbonara? It isn't me, this is... I don't want to know. -It isn't me. Who is it then? My mother? No. Tarik? -What? Dad? What the fuck was that? Who are you? Who are you? -Tarik. Tarik Bos. No, that man down there, that's Tarik. That's my father. Sorry. I'm really sorry. Don't shoot. Please, don't shoot. -You deserve it. Please. -You deserve it. You called me a pedo. That was a joke. -I didn't think it was funny. Sorry. -Why couldn't you just be nice? What? -Be nice. Why can't we just have different opinions and be nice about it? You and I. I'm a person, Tarik. If you call me a fucking whore, a stupid bitch, a pedophile, I feel that. It keeps me awake. Do you get it, Tarik, that other people also have feelings? Yes. -I don't deserve this. I'm not a nazi, not a psychopath, not an enemy of the people. The fact that I have another fucking political opinion... ...doesn't mean I'm not a person. I'm not a monster, I'm Femke, just Femke, just a woman... ...who writes for a newspaper, with a different opinion to you. I don't deserve this. Do you get that? Yes, I get it. Yes. You are what is wrong with this world. You and your whole army of losers with a laptop. I'm sorry I just shot your father. Femke? What have you done? He deserved it. No. Yes, he deserved it. No-one deserves this, Femke. Why are you taking his side? His side? Femke... Why are you taking his side? There are no sides. He deserved it. Femke? Here's to life.
