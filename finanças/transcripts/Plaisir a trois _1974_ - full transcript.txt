It's a pleasure to see Madame again after such a long absence And my KEY? Nothing has changed Monsieur has insisted the house be kept as it was when you left So, m)! key? Madame, what a tragedy! The Bishop... he was... God! And everyone was staring at him... Up on the balcony... No one moved... Falling down... The blood... Everywhere... Everywhere...! Madame... Oh, Madame How horrible it was Yes, I know. Calm down You should forget about this, Malou - And the garden? - The garden hasn't lost it's charm Nor the presbytery it's brilliance.

Gave me such pleasure I've had enough. Can't I go now? It's freezing down here Do you know how I kill them? Are you shivering from cold or fear? - This isn't funny. Let me go - You're afraid, aren't you? I love the fear on your face! Let me go! Let me go... Never... Charles, at last... Why did you make me wait so long?

Now we can start again Will it really be as before, my love? I promise Did you spend all our money while I was locked up? Were you a silly boy? Darling, you know the money we've enjoyed is yours I only spent what I had to. Except of course for the big costs... paying off the doctors and the judges Didn't you ever think about dumping me? Have me locked up forever and take all the money? How can you even think stuff like that? Let's just be happy you're free And let's enjoy what we've got together I have a surprise for you. One I think you'll like Mmm... Who's she? Cécile, the daughter of a diplomat She's only 21 and I hear she's still a virgin I met her at a posh reception.

We'll soon have that little bitch Let's take our time, darling We didn't start this race just to fall at the last fence In a few days she'll be all ours, I promise And you told me she was an innocent girl She's just a dirty slut! Look at this She's touching herself again She's masturbating in full view. She's a dirty exhibitionist I must say, I don't exactly object It turned you on yesterday You liked it too I'm shocked... She's really going for it Very promising Your good little girl turned out bad She's just at that age when the senses explode From what I can see... she was strictly brought up, so now it's all boiling over Just wait We'll educate her in pleasure The discovery of eroticism will be a real revelation for her She's confused now Soon, she'll experience more pleasures... than most people do in an entire lifetime And at the end of her lustful journey, death awaits her I'll make her pay for what she's doing to me now Bloody little virgin... Look at her! She's really possessed The dirty bitch Tomorrow we'll get the mansion ready for her Don't get impatient, she'll be yours You wait... we'll know such orgasms through her This girl was born to be corrupted by us Come here, Adéle Come on! Strip You've served us well Now it's time for your reward Hello... Yes, who's calling? Oh, it's you! Yes, from tomorrow But of course We'll treat her like our own daughter No, no... We'll pick her up ourselves Don't worry. She'll be no trouble to us at all On the contrary... See you soon. Sure... We'll take good care of her. You can be sure of it, sir See? It's all going as planned And you wanted to rush things... My sweet It's wonderful. I was afraid that at the last moment... It's all going to be fine, you wait Cécile, I'm sure you're going to love our place It's so quiet and peaceful. Like another world It's so nice of you to help me escape my parents like this That's not very kind. But young people need... their freedom sometimes - Now forget your worries - I feel free already It's lovely here I think I'll enjoy my stay at your place - Good morning, Madame - Good morning, Malou Meet Malou, our gardener A bit simple, but an excellent gardener Yes, Madame. A gardener, but above all, simple Miss is pretty Such a shame - A real shame... - A shame, why's that? This poor bishop... His head!... The blood... splashing everywhere! Like an egg! Come on, calm down, Malou Like an egg! Poor Malou never got over an accident he saw 10 years ago A bishop fell from a balcony. Caused Malou to lose his mind Like an egg... That poor bishop Don't be afraid, Cécile He's not quite normal... But he wouldn't hurt a fly... or a flower Like an egg... Like an egg Would you mind if I took this bath with you, Cécile? No. On the contrary... - We're all girls together - That's right - You have lovely breasts - But... Don't be shy... Just relax Forget bourgeois morality... all that hypocrisy - You like that? - Oh, yes... One should live life, Cécile What's wrong? - Does it feel strange? - Very much... But it's good Just enjoy it What lovely breasts Adele, have you ever been with another woman? Is it nice? Do you like your boss? Do you fancy me? Would you like to make love to me? It's good with women - So what's happening? - Everything's going as planned Adéle's doing as we told her I'd like to watch them. Let me enjoy the show too She's such a slut The horny little bitch She's getting right into Adele's fantasies We're just bringing out the slut that's in all girls of her age No surprises, my sweet Watching this is really turning me on Let me join them No way. Your intervention could traumatise Cécile You'll have your chance soon She's undeniably skilled Very promising We're really going to enjoy her - Sit down, please - Thanks - What's up, Mr Bressac? - Exactly what we feared A relapse? So soon? Yes. And this time it seems really serious I think you should see her - Why's that? - Several reasons My wife seems to be cured, but... But I can't deny the evidence It's all too obvious She suffers nightmares, deliriums... Paranoid delusions She even threatens to kill herself - Really? - Yes, doctor She doesn't talk to me. She just stays in her room She won't open the door, even to the maid I bring her meals myself And she barely eats, it's worrying I wonder if she should be committed again I feared a relapse but I didn't think it would be so soon Mr Bressac, we may have to consider a much longer confinement Bring her here But don't tell her she's going to be staying here Say it's just for a check-up, that should sound plausible to her But I have to tell you the truth A relapse so soon is very alarming - You must be patient and brave - I understand... But I'll do anything for my wife So, Cécile, are you enjoying your stay? It's Paradise here. I hope I never have to go back to my parents That's not very nice. They love you very much You're their only child and their only reason to live Let's not talk about them You seem distant, Cécile. What's on your mind? I feel dizzy. I think I drank too much - Let's play a game - Great idea. I love games We write our names on paper We draw lots and the chosen person has to do everything they're told What do you think? - Everything they're told? - Yes! - That sound good, Cécile? - Sounds marvellous - Who's first? - We draw lots. The papers... go in here. Let your chaste and pure hand choose our destiny Go on Destiny has chosen... Marti ne! Well, my sweet... How about a striptease? A bit more atmosphere, please! The hand of destiny selects a second victim What torment shall we inflict on her? Ask her to fake sex up to orgasm. What about that, Cécile? I like it... So who will destiny choose next? Oh my God! What's he going to make me do? What delights will you inflict on me? I'm sure he'll come up with a great idea Your wish will be my command So Charles, what's your idea? Cécile, with Adéle, will show us how two persons of the same sex do it Now join in Guess what name is on this piece of paper - I bet it's mine - Yes, Charles. It's your turn You have to mime the possession of our sweet Cécile Me? If that is your wish. The game is the game... - Cécile. . . - Yes? Come, Adéle I love your body You're going to make me come... Hello Miss. Mr and Mrs de Bressac have asked me to tell you... they will be back for lunch They have gone horseback riding in the countryside - Can I get you anything? - No, thank you, Mathias I'll take a little walk in the garden God, my head feels so bad... Very well Hello, Malou Ah Miss, how terrible! He exploded like an egg... All the blood! He was so handsome and they let him die What are you talking about? Save yourself... Don't let them do it All those women. How horrible! Don't ever go down there. Don't go into the basement! It's too dangerous. Too dangerous! You look lovely, Cécile We went to your room to ask you to join us... but you were asleep, we didn't want to wake you Mathias, we are ready I confess I don't remember much about last night I must apologise, I think I drank far too much I'm afraid I behaved badly No, you behaved very well, Cécile You filled a number of gaps in your education I indulged myself in some guilty pleasures I'm embarrassed to think about it There's no guilt in pleasure None at all And... The only fault is in your education I understand you're embarrassed by certain acts of love... but that's just convention Middle class morality Completely out of date Morality is difficult to shake off Don't worry, sweet Cécile, we'll show you how My wife and I can educate you if you wish You put me in a difficult position How can I discuss this when I know next to nothing... of the most basic relations between a man and a woman That's up to you Do you like Mr de Bressac? He would be the perfect instructor for you Your husband? But how can you...? Forget about ethics, dear Cécile My child, you know so little of the joys of love Come with me. I'll show you one of the many faces of pleasure It's cold here! I'm waiting! No! Let me go! No, stop this! Stop this! No! - Recognise this poison? - No You've used it often enough This drug is an Indian poison that paralyses... but keeps you conscious My refined, millionaire wife can hear everything we say She will miss nothing It must be terrible not to be able to scream Unable to express one's anger Cécile and I have been lovers for almost a year now She's not the innocent that turned you on so much We set up this plan together And you reacted exactly as we'd hoped Even better, in fact Now, I'm rich Cécile and I can enjoy your huge fortune... in peace And that's what we will do You thought to kill Cécile... Now your life is over... For good And ours begins Cécile and I will take that trip you dreamed of Can you hear me, Martine? You're already so far away As soon as the paralysis wears off I'll inject you with embalming fluid And you'll join your other victims Oh, Adéle wants to say goodbye See? We're still thinking of you How angry you look Come on, give me one of your smiles You're so pretty when you smile There... It's over Let's go Let's go, Mathias Step on it, Mathias THE END
