Clear. Burbank tower this is Howard, six, five, zero, four, six, ready to go. Roger. Well I hoped to have never. Jasper when are you gonna shoot this thing, put it out of its misery? Ah, now Briggs you shouldn't talk like that. This faithful old beast of burden's got plenty of miles left in it. What are you doing just sitting there? Your turn to get the water. Soon as I get me some money I'm going back to Kentucky. Just get the water and stop bellyaching. Don't use that brand new pan. Use one of those old buckets we've been using. Joseph James how can we be selling them if you're just giving them? See, are you happy now? There's a stream right down the hill. Well it's about time, eh? It's only half full. It's just to get us on down the road a piece. Listen why don't you hurry up? I don't like it up here at all. What's eating you? There's something out there Jasper. I seen big huge footprints down by that stream, like I've never seen before. Briggs my good man if you continue to travel with me you'll see a lot things you've never seen before. Red Bluff Radio this Howard, six, five, zero, four, six. Approximately 40 miles northwest of Ref Bluff. Mayday, mayday, mayday. Red Bluff Radio, this is Howard, six, five, zero, four, six. Approximately 40 miles northwest of Red Bluff. Mayday, mayday. Red Bluff do you read me? Daddy who are those people in Bennett's store? I don't know honey, just weekend bike riders I guess. - Come on your mother's waiting. - Okay. Hey you, give that back to me. What's the trouble Pops? Make him give that back. We need this to ice up our drinks Mike. Well then pay the man for it. How much? Well that's a pretty good ice chest, how about two dollars? Fine. Jasper, why don't you get that horn fixed? Why should I, no it works pretty good. You saw them skedaddle out of here didn't you? Well let's get on inside. Looks like a good place to get rid of some of your junk. I wouldn't be too sure Briggs. A fella that could survive in town like this might be a pretty sharp trader. How do you do? Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Jasper B. Hawks, sole proprietor of one of the few remaining traveling stores. Since you are a retailer we're offering a handsome discount to you on any item you may care to purchase. Oh, this is my associate Mr. Elmer Briggs. - Howdy Elmer. - How do you do sir? What can I do for you gents? Well before we talk any business, Mister, Mister? Bennett, Bennett. Oh, Bennett, well Mr. Bennett my associate and I would like to cool our dry throats with some good cold beer. There's not a drop of beer in the house. That wild motorcycle outfit that just left here took the last can we had. Well then Mr. Bennett we'll just have to impose upon your hospitality to substitute whatever you've got in stock to quench our thirst. Pa, these gentlemen do look a little thirsty. Let me get them a couple of Pepsis. Ah that's a good girl. Fine daughter, that daughter of mine. A very fine daughter. Ain't you coming Rick? You and Peggy go on, we'll join you later. Where you going? Can't you see that they want to be alone? If we're not back by the time you leave don't worry, we'll catch up to you on the road. You play nice you hear? I think I'll take a look at the bike and see why it's cutting up. Hey wait a minute. Would it be too bad if we were stuck here all alone? Hey now, don't get started or we will be here all night. All right go ahead, make love to your iron mistress. Rick? Rick? Rick? What? I found something. - Where are you? - Over here. This place looks like an old Indian burial ground. Say, dig the size of these graves. They must've been giants. This one looks fresh. What are you doing? I want to see what's in it. - Rick. - Ah relax. Oh, leave it alone and let's get out of here. Get a load of this. Kathy. Give me a beer. Come on Dum Dum, cut it out you big creep. Wheels make him stop. - Hey come on Dum. - Knock it off. She called me a big slob. I called you a big dumb slob. Hey why don't you cool it man? She's always picking on me. He's throwing beer on my face. I like to hear you scream. She screams so nice. Ah such a dummy, dummy, dummy. Hey come on, it's getting cold, let's split. Rick and Chris, they aren't back yet. Oh they'll catch up with us on the road. What if something's happened to them? Oh nothing's happened. Besides Rick can take care of himself. Nice to see you again Mrs. Cummings. Oh, honey look I've got something for you. A little present for you, all right? Come on dear. Mr. Bennett I'll tell you what'll I do. I got an even baker's dozen of these and I'm plum tired of carting them around the countryside so I'll tell you what I'll do, I'll give you all 13, get away child you're bothering me, for the price of six. Now you won't have any trouble getting rid of them because on these rock roads these gadgets are always... Look, I don't need this stuff. You fellas have been around here for a couple of hours. You introduced your friend to me and all that sort of thing and I like it, but I can't use it, that's all. Pa, I'm gonna lock up the money in the safe. Okay honey, I'll be in shortly. Got a phone I can use? Yes it's over there on the wall, don't make any long distance calls. It's local. Hello, get me the Sheriff's office. Hello Sheriff can you come up to, what's the name of this place? Bennett's store, he knows where it is. I'm at Bennett's store Sheriff and something terrible has happened. Hank. - Hank. - Yeah? Another one them creature stories only this one tops them all. It took off with his girl he thinks. Well I don't blame that creature if it's one of them sweet little things. Now what you say, I ain't denying, but do you know how many calls I get a year from people who claim they see these things? I know, I know. Now son, why don't you just go on home and go to bed? If your girl doesn't show up by morning well just give us a ring and we'll come and look things over for you. But Sheriff I swear, I'm sure it's got her. Yeah, well I'll go up and take a look for myself. If you're what the tax payers are paying for... Now you hold it boy. I don't know who you are and this could be one of them prank calls, but if you think you're gonna get me on top of that mountain tonight on some wild goose chase you got another thought coming. Why don't you talk to Bennett? Good idea, hey boy, put Mr. Bennett on the phone. He wants to speak to you Mr. Bennett. Oh all right. - Hello Cyrus. - What's going on up there? Is this boy telling the truth? Well he just could be, there's been a lot of strange things going on here lately. No, the girl's not with him now. She was with him this afternoon when he was in here though. Well now Bennett the boy's just a little excited. I'll tell you what, Hank and I'll come up in the morning and have a look around. Goodbye Cyrus. Yeah get me eight, seven, five, three, four, zero, one. Wheels, get back out here on the double, I need help. You won't believe this Wheels but a huge strange looking creature all covered with hair flattened me and now I can't find Chris. No I'm not kidding. I called the Sheriff and he, okay, you get back out here, but fast. I need a gun and a flashlight Mister, can you sell them to me? We're out of flashlights, we don't have much call for guns around here. I told you there was something strange down by the creek bed Cousin Hawks. Pretty fetching story son, I suppose you think we were a born yesterday to believe a tale like that? Are you calling me a liar Mister? Now hold it boy don't get your pressure up. It isn't every day we hear tell of a critter such as you described running off with a pretty filly. Now wait a minute this might be very serious business Mr. Hawks. I've got every reason in the world to believe this boy is telling the truth. Yes I have because a couple of months ago there was a pair that came up here, a young couple, on a camping trip up in these parts. They went up on top of the mountain by a beautiful lake up there. Something awful happened up there. They found the boy dead, broken neck, and the girl they never did find. Beautiful blonde too. I tell you what boy I got guns and lights out in the car. Suppose my friend Briggs here and I go along with you, get a looksee at this varmint. Wait a minute there Jasper. I ain't going along with you on any wild goose chase. Briggs can't you understand what we got here? I heard tell of these things before. Read an article in a magazine about a month ago. Some hunters got a picture of one of them. If we catch one of these critters we could live high on the hog for the rest of our lives. Look I appreciate your help, but all I want to do is get my girl back. We'll do that for you all right boy. We got another reason for joining you, right Briggs? Oh I've got to hand it to you Jasper, you smell a dollar sign a mile away. Well come on boy we haven't got any time to lose. Hold it men, you better watch your step when you go up there. Been strange doings in them mountains, especially at night. Mr. Bennett we aim to be careful. Whatever those things are up there, they better watch out for Jasper B. Hawks. This is the place. Well I wonder what that tombs says. This must be one of them barren cemeteries. It doesn't say a word written on that tombstone. This is remarkable Briggs. As a former student of archeology I recognize these markings as having a peculiar significance. Here. Maybe this will convince you more. Oh indeed. Now, do you believe me? What kind of creature is that anyhow? Well certainly it's some kind of animals, primates. They bury their own dead. Cousin Hawks I, I've got a feeling we better get out of here. The sooner the better. You listen to me Briggs, you and me is gonna make a fortune out of this. There's no turning back for anything. I want you to get something straight right now Mr. Hawks. We came up here to get my girl, nothing else. Boy, maybe you ought to get something straight. You need us worse than we need you. Briggs and I we've got guns, we've got lights. We need to get that creature alive. Find your girl there, fine, we'll get her too. I figure you ought to be mighty grateful Briggs and I came along with you. See we're business men. If we're gonna spend our time here we aim to make it worthwhile, understand? What do these creatures want? They're more human than you think. I'm sure that's why they brought us here. But why? The only thing that I can figure out is that they're a dying race and they want to reproduce more of their own kind. How horrible. I tried to escape once, but these creatures have such an acute sense of smell and all that they can find you anywhere. What happened to the other girl? They took her away. I haven't seen her since. But what are they? They're practically subhuman, except they still live like animals. What do you mean? Have you ever heard of the gap, the gap between the neanderthal man and the human? - Like the missing link? - Exactly. Scientists say there is a missing link. Well maybe these creatures are what they're talking about. Have they done anything to you yet? No, that's the odd part of it. I have the strangest feeling they're saving me for something special. - But what? - I don't know. But there's something they seem to fear on top of this mountain. What could they possibly be afraid of? Something more powerful than them maybe. Now stop! I just gotta rest before we get to that stream. You plain fool Briggs, haven't you got any better sense than to holler out here in the middle of nowhere? I just can't get no further Jasper, I'm plum tuckered out. We got a lot more to go so you might just as well get used to it. We ain't gonna do no good in the dark, you can count on that. Especially since we don't know the territory. Okay, stay here tonight Briggs if you want to. Mr. Hawks and I are going on ahead. Are you gonna let him talk to me like that Jasper? Now hold it, both of you. No sense in getting your feathers ruffled over nothing. Briggs got a point, that's a pretty steep climb up that bluff. We might just be a little bit loco trying to get there in the dark. Give me that rifle and that flashlight so I can go on by myself. Well now boy, you just go right on ahead and be a hero if that's what you want to do, but you're not taking my rifle or my light. Of course if Briggs wants to give you his. I ain't gonna give my gun and light to anybody. I need it for myself, for my own protection. I see where I stand, but I'm still going on. Boy you haven't got as good sense as I gave you credit for. What are you trying to say Mr. Hawks? Now look here boy. It's gonna be daylight in a few hours. We can march through these woods all night without sleep, but come morning we'll be so plum tired we won't be alert enough to see what's happening and that's exactly what's gonna happen if you keep on talking stupid. Cousin Hawks is right son. Now he's hunted all kinds of varmints all over the country, and he ain't gonna give you any misguidance. I guess you're right, we've come quite a ways already, maybe we better rest. Best news I heard so far. Well you two fellas turn to, I'm gonna stand lookout for a while. Cousin Hawks do you reckon that varmint's out there somewhere in the dark waiting for us to fall asleep? I don't reckon that varmint's anywhere within your hollering distance, but I'm not taking any chances. I wonder if Chris is still alive. Oh she's all right boy. Well look, if that critter wanted to kill you he'd done it down by the graveyard. No siree, you'll find out she's perfectly all right. We gotta make tracks good and fast come morning. What do you think they're doing with her? There's no sense worrying about that tonight. We'll find all the answers in the morning. What are they gonna do? They're probably going hunting. They'll leave their baby here to watch us. Looks so different from the others. - It could be a hybrid. - Hybrid? Yes, one of his parents had to be a creature and the other, might've been human. We're guessing right. It's trying to throw us off the track crossing that stream and up this cliff. It can't fool Jasper B. Hawks. How far away do you think they are Mr. Hawks? We have a spell ahead yet. But even that creature's gotta rest sometime. There's no sign anywhere he even stopped, let alone bedded down. I surely hope you cycle buddies are on the way. They'll be along. Here we go. It goes right up there into those mountains. You know Briggs, if I had my Blue Ticks and Red Bones here we could sit back and let those hounds push that critter out of the thicket. Briggs you go on ahead of us a piece. Cousin Hawks, if I see that thing, do I get to take a shot at it? You just let me decide that when the time comes. Get on up there, we got a lot of ground to cover. What's that putrid odor, musky smell? Don't you smell it Briggs? No Jasper I don't smell nothing. Oh you wouldn't. All you can smell is you. There's something around here. It's coming from right over there. Well I wished to have never. Well I'll be a two headed cat. Will you look at that? Briggs, we got a fortune on our hands here. Very soon the world will be bidding us thousands of dollars... Knock it off Hawks. We're up here to rescue my girl remember? We'll get her all right boy. Just let me wing him Jaasper. Are you touched in the head? You winging one of those critters would be like being in a cage with a wooden bar. No, we'll follow him, find out where the girl is first. Come on. Why don't we just quit Jasper? We done lost the track. We came up here to find that critter and we're gonna find him. Now how do you know it didn't just go down the other side? We don't boy. But it's gotta live somewhere and I got a hunch it's right up there. Jasper my old legs aren't holding out too good. Well they better 'cause we're not quitting until we find it. But doggone... We're sitting on a million dollars Briggs and it's right up there. When we find it Mr. Hawks I want you to shoot it. Now hold on boy, not if I don't have to. That critter's worth more alive to me then dead. We could always stuff it and take it on tour. People would pay to see that. You just worry about those legs of yours not giving out and you do anything crazy like shooting at it, I'm gonna skin you alive and stuff you. You'd look mighty pretty halfway through the wall over my mantel piece. You're so anxious to catch that critter alive. Just how do you plan to do it? When that time comes boy, if it comes, then I'll show you. Come on. Doggone, the old legs. Slave driver. Fellas, the sheriff. Good morning Nellie. Good morning Sheriff, Hank. How you doing fellas? - Hi Sheriff. - Hi Sheriff. Ah it's good seeing you two again. What brings you up here in these parts? Well I was talking to your dad on the phone last night and some boy who was real excited about seeing things. Hank and I just took a ride up to check it out. Where is your dad? You just missed him. He had to get out of the county seeing on business. But Pa told me about that boy who called here last night. Well he left with a couple of peddlers. Hard telling where he went. Well they're gonna have mighty tough going if they head on up into that high country. I sure wish your dad was around. Deer season opens soon and I plan on being right here for opening day. Great. - Sheriff? - Yeah. You know that crossing up by the old saw mill? I sure do. I just spotted a 10 pointer and couple does up there. Well thank you Hardrock I'll have a look. You're welcome. Here are your vittles Hardrock. This ought to hold you and Falling Star for quite a spell. Give them to Slim. Hurry up, Slim, thanks there's more. Thank you Nellie. - Here's the other box. - Let me. There you are Hardrock. Thank you Hank. Bye Nellie, see you Sheriff. - Bye. - Bye. Fellas, that's nothing. Last night I seen a 12 pointer right in back of the store. Cyrus, you can have that sawmill. I'll just set out here in back and wait for that 12 pointer. Sheriff, I mean Cyrus, I'm kind of inclined to believe that boy who called you last night. I really think he did see something. He was very upset. I don't know. If there's any trouble we'll hear from the ranger station. Yeah. They probably just took off and went on their way. I wouldn't be too sure about that Hank. That boy's cycle is still parked out front. I seen that cycle parked out there. One of them fancy rigs. I bet that thing must've cost $100. He'll be back for it sooner or later. You tell your dad I'm sorry I missed him. I'll see you for Friday night. Cyrus, please don't forget your Stogies. You get mighty mean to live with when you run out. Almost forgot what I came after. See you Friday, bye. Bye Cyrus. Hank, one for you. Thanks Nellie, bye. Bye. You know Nellie sometimes I think that Hardrock is seeing things, think he's getting senile. I've been working up there around that logging place up there for a long spell and I ain't never seen no deer up there as big as he said there were. Henry, nobody believes them creature stories either, but I know there's something mighty peculiar up there. Henry did you know that Hardrock had one too many cards? - Wow. - Jeez look at this. What is it? Whatever he is, he sure is big and ugly. It's a gorilla. Is that the kind of creature that Rick was talking about? I guess so. Well you can count me out. What do you mean? If you're going after one of them things you gotta be kidding, we're splitting. What do you think Wheels? Let him go. Then let's get moving. How much further, how far do we have to go now hmm? I don't know. I think we're in for a long haul though. Hey Wheels get a load of that old shack over there. They got an Indian girl sitting out in front of it. Let's take a look. I'm walking. Howdy son. What're you all doing up here? We lost one of our buddies. Then he called us and something about some big creature taking his girl. Sasquatch. Sasqua-who? What does that mean? That's Indian talk, for bigfoot. Bigfoot? Ain't no funny telling, them creatures are up there on top somewhere. Then it's true? Take it from old Hardrock, a couple of years ago he was up in the hills, he saw one of them. I heard a noise and smelled a musky odor, and I looked up and I saw some kind of a strange creature, all covered over with hair. Almost nine foot high. He grabbed me, but I pulled away, but I lost this. I'd keep away from up there is I was you folks. Why even the Indians out here won't go up in that high country. Mister we ain't got much choice. Tell you what, if you're set on going up there maybe me and Slim could go along too, maybe we can help you out. Falling Star get my coat and my shotgun. Don't worry honey we'll be back. What's that mean? That's Sioux for bad medicine. Let's get moving. Yeah there's enough of us now. Maybe I can settle an old score. - You ready Slim? - I'm with you Hardrock. Follow me, I know a shortcut up to the top there. Hey wait, Wheels look at this baby. Dynamite, where'd you get it? Back of the shack man, they got plenty of it back there. That's been back there for years. I don't care, I'm gonna take it along just in case. Well we better get moving. What are those critters gonna do with us? They don't seem to have much use for men. They'll probably kill all of you. Well that remains to be seen. Jasper B. Hawks has been in a lot of tight spots, he always got out of them. Well you better do something pretty fast Cousin Hawks. I don't like the way them critters is looking at us. What are they doing? I don't think they mean to hurt you honey. They would've did that before if they wanted to. Please no. Let me go! Since you're a know it all why don't you tell her? No please don't, no! Now don't sweat it Sheriff, we get the same reports about them creatures up here that you do. Ah come on Cyrus. If I was you I'd go ahead and go hunting. After all you haven't missed an opening day for years. No news here, just a report of a small private plane missing up here somewhere but we haven't found it yet. Nothing gets by us up here, take it from me, right? Sure. All right, okay, just take it easy Cyrus. Sheriff here's your reports for the day. Well thank you Sally they look good and thanks for staying over. - You're welcome, goodnight. - Bye. - Goodnight Hank. - Goodnight Sally. See you in the morning. You know Cyrus that might not be so darn funny at that, I've gotten a few of them calls when I've been alone at night. I've been Sheriff of this county going on to 20 years now. If I believed all them stories about people seeing those creatures I'd be plum loco chasing them out. - Yeah I guess you're right. - Hey look at this. Here's a guy they're really after and we know he exists. They had him in jail for a year. Bad check writer huh? Well he won't cash in any of that bad reading at Bennett's. Why if he comes through here Bennett would be the first one to let us know there's a stranger cashing checks. How about cleaning the rest of our guns? Sure. I'm going home get some rest, I need some... Cyrus, let's take a gander up there tomorrow, could be that young fella just might be on the level. Fresh air will feel good. Been looking like rain though lately. Weather's really unpredictable this time of year, but we'll take a ride. Hey give me my favorite 20 gage Remington automatic there will you? - Creature Cyrus? - Rabbits. Briggs, Briggs. Briggs. Can't you let a man get a little shuteye Jasper? This is no time to sleep you fool. You know Briggs we got it made, millions. Whatever are you driving at? See that baby critter over there? That Briggs is money, a whole lot of money. Oh maybe not as much as bigfoot, but this one will grow up and it'll be ours, all ours, yours and mine. Well now is a hell of a time to talk about business. That's the difference in our upbringing. That's why I gotta successful selling business and you're working for me. Well then if you're so successful why do we spend our time sleeping in that station wagon instead of in one of them fancy camping tents? Well you stick with me and you'll maybe one day own one of them fancy camping tents, maybe a whole string of them. How do you figure that? Remember all the money we made in that carnival, that big snake from South America, all those people paying 50 cents just to see it? Oh yes I remember that Cousin Hawks. You know if that old snake hadn't died we'd have been rich by now. We got something here that'll make more money than that snake ever could, they live to be 100 years old. Yeah. Mrs. Clemons said that we can come back to the carnival if we ever found anything else interesting. We don't need any broken down carnival manager to take the cream off this deal. Sure I can see it now. The Jasper B. Hawks traveling show. With the greatest spectacle of all time, the missing link. Oh. Yes but first I'd like to get out of here, and then hear more about it. You just got no imagination. Chris, do you hear that? There's a lot bigger critters than that one Cousin Hawks. You heard what they said about a bird in the hand? They might come from those bushes there now, there may be more of them now. Jasper, Jasper why don't you tie that critter up so he won't attack me again? That's a mighty good idea. - Here, give me that. - No. Come on give it to me. Why don't you use that pretty handkerchief you got there? It's no handkerchief, it's a fine expensive piece of shawl and I'm not gonna use that. Come on give it to me. You look better without a tie anyway. Gives you that Lord Byron look, come on give it to me. No sense buttoning your coat, you can't anyway, you're too fat. So come on, come on. Come on hold still you little monkey. Though I shouldn't call you a monkey should I? Okay tie him. Come on hold still, I'll wallop you. Here we go. Much obliged. Get back. Let's get back to the others. Maybe we can get a chance to get one of the big critters. You're crazier than a loon Cousin Hawks. I aim to be a rich man Briggs, but come on we got them critters on the run. Not with me you ain't. The only place that I'm going is back to the car. You just do that Briggs, but when I get a hold of another of those creatures don't you come around wanting your half interest. Not on your tin tax I won't. Well. Who'll come along with me? We're with you Mister, right Hardrock? Come on Rick let's get her down the hill. Wheels, thank you. Well wait a minute boys, wait a minute, I'll pay anyone of you, anyone of you that comes with me I'll pay you. Well now that makes a difference. Now that's more like it. I'm with you if you're paying money. Money, you ain't seen the likes of the money I'm gonna pay you. I may be a Johnny Reb but this ain't Confederate money, oh. Come on. That's right up ahead, come on. Oh indeed. He's bigger than all of them. That sure enough is bigfoot, the eighth wonder of the world. - Well let's go get him. - Yes sir. Come on Wheels. Hey, wait for me, that's my critter up there. - Stop it you fool. - What? You're gonna kill my critter. I'll give you $100, no $500 to the man who keeps him alive. You plain idiot I said alive. My critter, my poor critter, I'll never get him now. Well Slim we finally got him. It wasn't you Mister it was beauty that did him in. Come on Hardrock, I guess it's all over now. Yeah. Do you think he's really dead? Now young lady don't you look so sad. Jasper B. Hawks is right here to offer you the opportunity of a lifetime. What do you mean Mr. Hawks? Now my dear I've been connected with some of the greatest phenomenon in show business in the last few decades. What does that got to do with me? Well I'll just tell you little flower. You and me are gonna make a million dollars. We are, how? It's very simple, just you and me together. But? Now just you put your faith in Jasper B. Hawks. We'll tour the country, the continent, everywhere. Well people all over the world will gladly pay a pretty penny not only to contemplate the delectable contours of your imposing beauty but also to hear all about the thrills and chills and risks you endured while you was a captive of these yet to be classified bigfoot critters. That exist right here on this great Earth. I can see it now. Beauty and the beast.
