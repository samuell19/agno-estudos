Impossible.. how could you think that.. ..I'll give my consent to this marriage? But I have already promised Priyaranjan, father. If you have already promised him then.. ..why are you asking for my opinion? Now I realise that it was my mistake to give you education. Just remember one thing.. if you marry this guy against.. ..our consent then you'll have to sever all relations with us. Chirasri, you must be knowing.. I have already.. ..told you.. that Ratnakar is not only my friend.. ..he is like a brother to me. I wouldn't ever got married if he was not there. Don't embarrass me, Priyada. You keep quiet.. do you know what all he had done? He hired a house for us.. paid the advance money.. ..bought necessary things for the house. And he has done all these with his own money. After all you know my capability! Okay.. okay.. you better keep an account of every penny. I'll take it from your wife along with interest. Please do that.. you should do that.. then I'll feel relieved. Actually you know what, sister-in-law? Sometimes in life one gets to come closer to someone.. ..to whom one feels like giving everything away and feel happy. From today onwards I'll call you only Sri. That will be an exclusive name, only for me. From today onwards I'll also call you only Ranjan. Even that will be an exclusive name, only for me. &quot;This fancy garland doesn't suit me.&quot; &quot;It hurts while I wear it.&quot; &quot;It my conscience doesn't even let me tear it.&quot; &quot;This fancy garland doesn't suit me.&quot; &quot;My heart wants to gift you something.&quot; &quot;My heart wants to gift you something.&quot; &quot;Even if you don't have the requirement.&quot; &quot;My heart wants to gift you something.&quot; &quot;Kiss me once, my dear.&quot; &quot;Kiss me once secretly.&quot; &quot;Please raise your face and look at me once, my dear.&quot; &quot;Please look at me once.&quot; &quot;Kiss me once, my dear.&quot; &quot;Kiss me once secretly.&quot; Eureka! What happened? You are Sri. And I am Ranjan if we have a son then we'll name him. Sriranjan. Are you happy? I am very happy. Sriranjan.. hey Sriranjan. &quot;My dear son, my sweetheart, has fallen asleep.&quot; &quot;My dear son, my sweetheart, has fallen asleep.&quot; Hey, listen.. - Yes. Why don't you ask your friend to come and stay with us. Poor thing! He lives alone in a mess. No, that won't look good. Why? People will say that I have used my beautiful wife.. ..in order to extract money from my rich friend. We are already very much indebted to Ratnakar. That's true. Priyada.. Priyada. Come.. come. Come in sit down. we were talking about you only. About me? - Yes. What were talking about me, sister-in-law? Take this. Forget that.. what have you done? - Why? Why did you bring such a huge fish? Who will eat such a big fish? We all will eat. We have already made rotis for dinner. Why didn't you come in the afternoon? Let it be.. actually you know what, sister-in-law. I live in a mess.. - Yes. My taste buds have become inactive by eating.. ..the food cooked by the male cook. So I wanted to eat food cooked by a woman and repair my taste buds. Well.. I understand.. listen.. can you hear me? Look for a nice girl and get him married immediately. He is not liking the food cooked by the male cook.. ..any longer.. he now wants a woman to cook for him. Did you hear that? Now you tell me, what kind of girl do you want as your wife? What kind.. tell us what kind. Mean while someone like the one sitting.. ..in front of me will do. What is he saying? You could have told me before.. ..I wouldn't have married her then. What's the point crying over spilt milk? Better late than never. Mr. cashier, you write the cash book sincerely. I should rather go in search of the jackpot. I have already got the jackpot, Gupta. Have you got it.. tell me then.. let me match with yours. Why will I tell you? What are you saying Roy Chaudhury? Please tell me. Working 4 hours overtime and getting the payment of 8 hours. The price of my son's one month's baby food. Nonsense! Are you annoyed with me? After all I am a family man I have a wife and a son to take care.. ..the race ground is not for me. Rubbish! Money is required.. money.. more money. Tie a 100 rupee note to a horse's tail. Then you'll see that it comes back to you being multiplied. It much reach even a lakh.. it all depends. No.. no.. what will I do with so much money? I am fine. This is why the Bengalis can never improve. Being adult they have a love affair.. ..next manage is a clerical job.. next manage is that girl. Next manage is a pregnancy.. next hospital.. ..and maternity ward.. next baby food.. all rubbish! Don't laugh.. be sporting, Ray Chaudhury.. be sporting. Tell me how. Have you ever had tea in an earthen cup? - Yes. Always consider your life as an earthen cup. You shouldn't use it the second time. Just use it once and throw away.. understand? Yes, I understand.. - You haven't understood anything. Bengali men don't understand, they don't want to understand. And they will never understand.. but I understand. And a day will come when I'll make.. ..the whole country understand. Listen.. - Yes. The laundry soap is exhausted.. get a box of soap. What? Only few days back Ratnakar had brought a box of soap. Few days back? Ratnakar had come 1 month back. We wash all our clothes at home.. ..isn't soap required for that? Well.. you are right.. but I am not being able to manage, Sri. But what do I do, tell me. Right.. but we are having such financial constraint. It's such a problem. What problem? The problem solver is at your service. Order me. No, just family talks.. now since you have come.. ..you sit for sometime.. talk to your sister-in-law. I have to go for shopping. Okay.. I'll wait for you. What's the matter, sister-in-law.. ..your face is looking gloomy Not at all.. actually. I was telling your Priyada to take a leave from the office.. ..so that we can go somewhere for a holiday. But he said that he can't take a leave now. Grand idea! Let's go for a trip to Digha.. okay? But.. - No ifs and buts. It's my responsibility to manage Priyada. You just give your consent.. yes.. yes. &quot;O beautiful, whose words have made you gloomy?&quot; &quot;O beautiful, whose words have made you gloomy?&quot; &quot;You are the best of pulses, you are the best of rice.&quot; &quot;You are the best of pulses, you are the best of rice.&quot; &quot;You are the best vegetable preparation I know that always.&quot; &quot;O beautiful, whose words have made you gloomy?&quot; &quot;O beautiful, whose words have made you gloomy?&quot; &quot;You are my Albert fashion, you are my.. ..shoulder length hair-cut.&quot; &quot;You are my gold buttons and you are the rose in my button.&quot; &quot;You are my Albert fashion, you are my.. ..shoulder length hair-cut.&quot; &quot;You are my gold buttons and you are the rose in my button.&quot; &quot;You are my beetle leaves and cigarette.&quot; &quot;You are my motor car.&quot; &quot;How do I explain who are you to me?&quot; &quot;You are my rose-perfume, soap and cream.&quot; &quot;You travel in a horse driven cart.&quot; &quot;O beautiful, whose words have made you gloomy?&quot; &quot;O beautiful, whose words have made you gloomy?&quot; Grand! Grand! You have sang very well! What's the next item? Let's all of us go for a run on the sea beach. No.. no.. I can't run around at this age. You better do one thing.. you take your sister-in-law along with you. She has got loads of energy. I'll rather be the referee. A referee always has to be impartial, get it? Do you have any doubt that I'll be impartial or not. No point fighting.. you give a start.. we are ready. Is that so? We enjoyed a lot in these few days.. isn't it, sister-in-law? Is that so? Sister-in-law, what's your hobby? Bringing up our son and loving your Priyada. How can you call this hobby? It's all about your desires and feelings. I don't understand any hobby.. that is everything for me. You are very lucky, Priyada. Hey, listen.. come closer.. let me take the measurement. Your luck also doesn't seem to be bad at all. You all sit here.. I am feeling sleepy. Did Priyada go away being angry with me? Why will he be angry with you? He felt sleepy so he went to bed. Ratnakar. The 3 plants seems to survive at last. Yes.. I can see that. But let's see which one bears flowers first. I hope your husband won't get angry. Are you joking with me? Sister-in-law, can we do one thing? Can we name the plants? What are those? That corner one should be named Priyashakha. The middle one should be named Srilata. And the one in this side is me.. Ratnakar plant. What happened? It seems that you have something to say. No.. nothing much.. sometime back you were saying.. ..let's see which plant bears flowers first. You mischievous boy! Wait.. I'll ask your Priyada to beat you up. I am afraid.. I am late, sister-in-law.. I am going. Don't forget about the evening. I won't forget. It's 9o' clock now.. I am getting late for the office. Will you serve me lunch or not? When will you come back. Let me see. What 'let me see'? Don't you remember what date it is today? Oh yes.. okay.. I'll come back early. Today we'll have dinner outside. Then we'll come back home after watching a film. Very good. I have asked Ratnakar to come as well. We'll take him along with us. I knew that. What's the matter? Aren't you liking Ratnakar these days? No.. nothing like that.. why do you think so? Actually a third person's presence is not acceptable.. ..in a marriage anniversary. &quot;I love you, I love you.&quot; &quot;This music is played by the flute in the water and earth.&quot; &quot;I love you, I love you.&quot; Come in.. it's open. &quot;Someone's heart aches in the sky.&quot; &quot;Someone's eyes are filled with tears in the horizon.&quot; &quot;Tears roll down from the eyes.&quot; &quot;I love you, I love you.&quot; Many many happy returns of the day! I wish your and.. ..Priyada's married life to bloom for ever. Oh it's you.. I thought. Priyada.. - Yes. This is for you. What beautiful flowers! What are you looking at? No.. nothing.. what's the programme for today, sister-in-law? First of all going to Park street and eating Chinese food. Very good. Then watching a 9 p.m. show of a movie. Even better. Then. Coming back late night and sleeping with Priyada. I'll beat you now.. sit down. You are coming back from the office. - Yes. What will you have? Tea or coffee? Please give me tea in your beautiful hands. You are again joking with me. Oh great! Sweets! Delicious! I hope you have made a good amount. You eat as mush as you can. Give me one more spoon full. Enough keep for yourselves too. You don't have to think about that.. you eat. That's not fair.. it'd your marriage anniversary. And I can't eat up all the sweets. By the way.. I had absolutely forgotten. I have brought this gift for you. How did you know? Perfume is my favourite cosmetics. That's a coincidence.. actually I have designed the bottle. That's why. Is that so? You have designed it beautifully. Do you remember you were asking me in Digha.. ..about my hobby.. that day I didn't tell you. I used to make cosmetics at home and had become very famous.. ..among my friends. Really? Yes.. I was very good student in Chemistry. I used to make new formulas on my own. Really? I was so childish then! I used to buy those small glass bottles put material in them.. ..then I used to cut papers.. type on them and put label.. ..on those bottles.. Chirasri cream. Crirasri scent.. Chirasri snow. Is there anybody home? Can you hear me? Who is there at home? Whom do you want? Is this Priyaranjan's house? - Yes. He has given this letter to you. Letter? Where is he? Don't be panicked he is stuck in the office for some important work. I work under him. He asked me to deliver this letter to you. I'll have to go now. - Greetings. 'Sri, I got stuck in the office on account of some important work.' I don't know when can I come back home.' 'You both should rather have dinner.. ' What happened, sister-in-law? Even today Priyada. Okay you stay at home. I'll go and make a phone call to Priyada. No. Okay then.. let's have a good chat. Why only chatting? You have to have dinner over here. I am going to cook rice. There is nothing much at home. Just omelette and mutton.. will that do? Sister-in-law, forget about dinner today. Ratnakar, do you want to make me more ashamed? You can't go from here without having dinner. Yes, the gentleman is very handsome. That man and your wife were laughing a lot. Priyada, is that man your wife's friend? No, he is my brother. &quot;Big faced greedy man. His house is at Bengal.&quot; &quot;Did you see that he never smiles?&quot; &quot;Doesn't it have any meaning?&quot; &quot;Does anybody know that?&quot; &quot;Has anyone of you stayed with him ever?&quot; Are you going out? Yes. Won't you have lunch? No, I have an appointment on the way. Couldn't you say that before? Wait? What has happened to you? Why are you behaving with me in this manner? What have I done? Do I have to say what have you done? Of course.. if you don't say it to me then who else will say? Will the neighbour's husband say it to me? Leave me.. let me go. Tell me clearly.. what do you want to say? I don't want to say anything. But I can't stop other people from saying. Forget about other people.. you talk about your opinion. Neighbours are saying filthy things about you. Don't you know that? Filthy things? What filthy things? People are saying filthy things about you and Ratnakar. What a shame! How can you say this to me? Ratnakar is like your brother.. he is my friend. I am affectionate about him.. besides do you want to.. ..believe and act according to what the other people are saying? Don't you have any feelings of your own? No, I don't have.. I don't have a clean mind like you. Hey, do you distrust me? Let me go. No, you tell me clearly.. do you distrust me? Stop nagging. What were we talking about? &quot;Big faced greedy man. His house is at Bengal.&quot; 'Hey, listen.. why don't you ask your friend to come and stay with us. Poor thing! He lives alone in a mess.. ' 'Sometimes in life one gets to come closer to someone.. ..to whom one feels like giving everything away and feel happy.. ' Can you tell me sister-in-law, how many stars are there in the sky? No.. - I can say. Is that so? - Yes. You can do many things, right? Yes, I can. Can you find me a job? You'll do a job!? Why? Can't I? What's the matter, sister-in-law? Why do you suddenly want to do a job? Did you have a fight with Priyada? We need money.. after all we have to bring up.. ..our son in a nice manner. You can't make me believe by saying that. What happened? Tell me clearly. Let's not talk about that. Sister-in-law, once you had told me that.. ..you consider me nothing other than a friend if that is true.. ..then can't you tell me? He doesn't trust me. Sister-in-law! Ratnakar. I have left my parents and my family because I love him I have become the ..mother of his child just because I love him.. ..I have done away with status and luxurious life just because I love him. And today he doesn't trust me. Because of whom does he distrust you? Me? How can Priyada become so mean? Sister-in-law. I don't want to come in between you two. I will never come to this house again. No, you have to come.. otherwise his allegations will be proven true. Tomorrow morning I am going out of Kolkata.. ..for 5 days for some official work. I'll meet you after I come back. Sri, open the door. Sri. Had you fallen asleep? No, I was on the terrace. it has become late night today, sister-in-law.. I am going. So you still have the intelligence.. ..to understand that it's late night. What a shame! How could you behave with Ratnakar in that manner? I behaved exactly the in manner that I should behave.. ..with a debauchee and a pervert. Ranjan, what are you saying?! Ratnakar is your brother he is my friend. Not any more.. he has spread his hands too far. If he wants to spread his dirty hands even further.. ..then I'll break it. Ratnakar will never enter this house. Even if he enters then I'll drive him out of this house. No, you can't do that.. Ratnakar is my friend.. ..and he will always remain my friend. I am not going to pay for your mistakes. Is this your last word? - Yes! Then you also listen to my last word. From today onwards don't call yourself my wife. What are you doing!? I am expiating my mistakes.. I don't want that a filthy woman.. ..to live as my wife. Once I had applied vermillion on your forehead. Today I am expiating my mistake.. ..by wiping that vermillion with my own hands. Wait.. I have something more to say. Today you have insulted the vermillion.. ..one day you'll have to repent for your deed. You'll again apply this same vermillion on my forehead with your own hand. I am accepting the punishment given by you. Hello.. who? Priyaran.. oh yes.. Ray Chaudhury. It's for you. Yes. - Hello.. who? Ranjan. Sri here.. hello. Hello.. hello. Who was that? No one. What do you mean by no one? I myself heard the voice of a woman have you fought with your wife? You are responsible for it. I am responsible? I am saying that you are responsible for it. If a wife has an affair with some other man.. ..then am I responsible for it? Of course you are responsible. Look Ray Chaudhury.. always remember one thing. Car and woman.. these two things should always be kept.. ..under control.. otherwise accidents are sure to happen. One can control a car.. but what about woman? You have to use the brake.. suppose you are stinking.. ..of liquor.. having lots of money in your pocket.. ..a race manual.. a long hair stuck over here. Lipstick mark over here.. then your wife will become alert. This is called brake.. I mean you have to counter attack. No, Guptada.. I have passed all those stages. I don't even stay at home now. My boy, as long as your Guptada is here.. ..don't get frustrated.. it's my bounden duty.. moral duty.. ..to look after you.. from today onwards you'll live in my flat. Okay? I am sorry, sister-in-law. I had to go out of the city due to office work during this period. Sister-in-law. Tell me. Did you call him in his office? He had cut the phone hearing my voice. What will you do now? Will you go back to your father? I had married him against my family's will. After all it was a love marriage! Sister-in-law, I won't try to give you any false consolation. I know that you are a strong woman. Now you tell me what do you want to do? You suggest me. There are two ways in front of you. One is to bring back Priyada at any cost and.. ..the other way is to fight. There is no point to bring him back after all these, Ratnakar. That will be the greatest insult of womanhood. That's true. Isn't it? Can I come in? Come in. Greetings! Greetings! Please sit down. Tell me what can I do for you? My name is Chirasri Ray Chaudhury. I.. - Yes.. tell me. I have tried a lot for a job but didn't get any. I want to do something on my own. I minute.. hello.. oh Mr. Bhatia.. tell me.. yes.. yes. No.. no.. Mr. Bhatia, you must be knowing.. ..what is the gimmick.. yes, 3 lakhs.. but we have.. ..given you 3 lakhs 6 thousands.. ..yes.. special case.. what? No.. no.. I am sorry. I don't have the authority to do that. The bank also has to abide by certain rules.. yes.. listen. You can submit the cheque and get the cash. There won't be any problem in that case.. yes. I am really sorry, Mr. Bhatia.. greetings. You have fought with your husband, right? He is not there. Oh I am sorry. The vermillion on your forehead.. -I didn't get the time to wipe it. For the one who has passed away.. ..it doesn't matter whether the vermillion is wiped off or not. But to bring up my child.. ..survive with respect and honour comes first. How far have you studied? Good.. now you tell me, how can I help you. You give loans for business, right? Yes, we give. I want to do a business.. can you arrange me a loan? What business do you want to do? Cosmetics. Cheers! Hey, listen.. 3 large.. 2 for me and 1 for him.. go get it. Hurry up. This. Mrs. Ray Chaudhury, can you spend some money? No. A little amount of money. I said no. Listen.. sit down. I can understand what.. ..you have thought or what you are thinking. But that's not right. Select a name for the company.. ..then spend a little amount of money and get a trade license.. ..and get some letter heads made in the name of the company. Then let's see what I can do. Please forgive me.. I didn't understand. Have you thought anything about the name of the company? Well.. yes.. Chirasri Cosmetics. Chirasri Cosmetics? What about Srimati Cosmetics? Srimati Cosmetics? Yes. Okay. I am very happy. Thank you.. - Welcome. How long have you been waiting? For sometime. Please sit down. Have you done all that I had asked you to do? Yes.. these are the papers. I can see that you have already sold your bangles. Now if the bank doesn't accept your proposal, then what? I haven't thought of anything. The bank can't sanction you a loan on the proposal that you have given.. ..but as a bank manager.. ..I have the power.. ..to give you 10,000 rupees.. ..of cash credit facility.. open an account in the.. ..name of your company with 500 rupees. Get the money from the cash and send Mr. Sen in my chamber. If required you can withdraw up to 10,000 rupees from this account. Start a business in a small scale. Then when transactions of money will happen then you can pay back the bank. Mr. Sen, this lady will open a cash credit account.. ..in the name of her company.. tell her clearly.. ..about all the formalities. Please come with me. Listen.. please meet me after your work will be done. Okay. Sign your full name over here. Thank you. Is your work done? - Yes, sir. Count the money. There is 2000 rupees. I am giving you the money from my personal account. You can give it back to me when your account will be open. Open a bank account with 500 rupees and with the rest.. ..meet your initial expenses.. start working from tomorrow. God be with you.. one more thing. When I had asked you to keep the name of your company Srimati Cosmetics.. ..then you didn't ask me why. I had a small daughter named Srimati. If she was alive then she would be of the same age like you. Strange man! Not only strange.. Mr. Tarafdar is like a god. I felt like showing my respect to him by touching his feet. Listen.. I have lots to talk about business with you. You can't go early. As you command. Nail polish, lac-dye, saffron and vermillion. I am thinking of starting with these 4 items.. what do you say? Very good. You have to do the get up design, I am telling you. Don't think about that, sister-in-law.. ..I'll make such a design.. ..that people will eagerly buy your product just seeing the label. Sure? - Okay. Priya.. - Yes. Are you going to the bank to deposit money? Yes, Guptada.. today is Saturday the bank will close at 12o' clock. Very good. What will you do after office? Nothing.. I am depending on you. Don't think about that. Till the time your Guptada is alive. You are his responsibility but you have to do things according to me. What's that? No.. no.. what rubbish are you talking? Look, the money is going to .. ..come into the bank. If we can make a quick buck in the process.. ..what's the harm in it? No.. what if someone finds out? Don't talk rubbish! Today is Saturday.. today you'll take the money. Sunday is closed.. you can deposit the money.. ..on Monday during the first hours. And if the management come to know that the money.. ..was not submitted on Saturday.. then what? You can make a phone call to the office from outside.. ..that you were going to deposit the money in the bank.. ..suddenly you met a neighbour of yours on the way.. ..and he told you that your wife has met an accident.. ..so you couldn't deposit the money.. it's a simple matter. No.. Guptada.. I am not confident about it.. I can't do this. Never mind.. I'll manage somehow. I can't just let go such a sure tip.. I'll see you in the evening.. ..in my flat.. bye. Please drive faster. What happened? I am in trouble.. come.. come on.. get in the taxi quickly. I'll tell you everything in the taxi.. driver, quick. Why did you stop me.. the bank will get closed. I want the bank to get closed. Listen.. please drop me in the bank.. there is no time. I have to deposit the money. Don't act like a crazy man, Priyaranjan. Chances don't come in life always.. ..this is a sure tip. Priyada.. hey Priyada. Sister-in-law.. you? You are the one who work in his office, right? Yes.. but I came to know that you have met an accident. Accident? I have met an accident? No.. I mean., What's the matter? Did you Priyada send you to spy on me? Believe me sister-in-law, I don't know anything about it. If you don't know then know it now.. come inside. See how I am.. what am I doing.. after all you'll have to report.. ..your Priyada while you go back.. come in. Pour some more water. Enough. Look, your product is new.. people doesn't know about it yet. We won't have any profit if we keep this kind of products. It's right that these are new products. But they are of very good quality. Might be.. but how will I understand before using them? No.. I mean.. if you can kindly push them. How much commission are you giving? - 25 %. Look, your product is new.. ..if you give 25% commission then what will be our interest? If you can make it 35% then give me some.. ..you can check the stock every week and get your payment. Why? Don't you make cash payments? We do.. but that's for the running products. Tell me what all do you want. Saffron 1 dozen, lac-dye 1 dozen, nail polish 2 dozens.. ..and vermillion 2 dozens. I told you, we don't sell such things. Try selling it once. Spare me, madam. Such ethnic stuff don't sell. Impossible, sister-in-law.. it won't happen like this. And it doesn't happen like this.. I have told you earlier.. ..that you can't sell your products in the market this way. For that you need to do advertisements and campaigns. You won't even touch my money.. that will hurt your ego. Why are you saying like that? Listen.. think well about what I say. It won't happen like this, okay? I'll talk to my office. If I can release the publicity by them then I'll get.. ..a credit facility of 3 months.. and I'll do the campaign. And yes.. in the mean time you talk to Mr. Tarafdar of your bank.. ..and try to solve the problem. I'll go tomorrow.. now please have some tea. No, I don't want to have tea now. What happened suddenly? You are not liking tea. Today I am not in the right mood, sister-in-law. Why? What happened? What happened, Ratnakar? What happened? Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law. Priyada has been sentenced to jail. Who gave you the news? A guy from his office. Priyada has stolen 10,000 rupees cash from the office. ..next day police came and arrested him. A chapter of my life has ended today. Sister-in-law. Ratnakar, what will I tell my son about his father, can you tell me? Sister-in-law. Instead of living like a thief's son, let him know that his father is dead. His mother is a widow. Is Mr. Tarafdar at home? You are Chirasri, right? Yes.. you must be aunty. Let it be.. come inside.. come. See who has come. Oh it's you! Come.. come.. please sit down. Did you recognise who she is? How is it possible that I won't recognise my daughter? Where were you hiding all these days, daughter? You have started again.. she is getting afraid. You sit here.. I'll be back in a while. Uncle. - Yes. I hope you won't mind if I call you uncle. Why will I mind? Actually I liked it very much. No.. I mean. Don't hesitate.. tell me.. after all you haven't come to meet.. ..a bank manager now.. you have come to meet your uncle. Why should a daughter hesitate in front of her father? No.. I mean.. uncle.. my business is not. Running smoothly, right? You need some more money. Well.. yes. You have to do more publicity. Yes. And more over there is a tough competition in the market. Yes. Silly girl! Do you think that I haven't thought about all these? The day I have granted you the loan that day only.. ..I had planned everything.. look I have my full trust on you. That's why I had arranged for your loan though I had a limited power. Besides I have placed you in the place of my dead daughter. Now it's my duty to think about youmy girl. Listen.. before going, take a letter from me. I have spoken to one of my big clients. They are a big distributors of cosmetics. They'll take all your product.. there will be.. ..an agency agreement.. then you can collect the bill from them.. ..and withdraw the money from our bank. All problem will be solved. No.. no.. don't cry.. wipe your tears. You had told me once that you'll fight.. listen.. ..you are my daughter.. you have to win. I want your blessings, uncle. You can take his blessings later.. now sit in front of me.. ..and eat these sweets. This is not right, aunty.. you are saying that I am your daughter.. ..just for the sake off saying.. have you ever heard.. ..that mother will bring food for the daughter.. ..and the daughter will eat them up? You are my daughter whom I had lost long back. Uncle, won't you say anything? No, I won't say anything.. after all it's between.. ..mother and daughter. Oh, I have absolutely forgotten.. I has brought some sample.. ..of my company's product for you.. I forget to give them. Wonderful! What beautiful packing! Take a look. I am giving this lac-dye and this vermillion to my wife. They are very nice.. I'll definitely use them myself. But I can't give this nail polish and saffron to my wife. These two are for my daughter. Take them. Take them. Listen, you have to get rid of this white outfit of yours.. ..you'll put a saffron dot on your forehead and apply nail polish.. ..on your nails.. you'll deck up nicely and come to our house.

Madam went inside a restaurant along with that old man. Then what? Very cheap restaurant. Then what? Then she spent half an hour with that old man.. ..and then came back. Then what? - Shut up, you idiot. I don't know anything after that. Go and ask Driver Mahadev to come and meet me. Now listen to me. Shut up.. as if know everything.. as if you know everything! Every bird eats fish but everyone blames the king fisher. I have heard from mother that you are very trust worthy. It was not right of you to leave mother in the middle of the way. But madam told me to do that. Still.. she is old now.. don't leave her alone like this. But sir, I am her employee.. it was madam's order. Trust worthy employee's duty is to take care of his employer. If she meets an accident while travelling alone? That's right, sir. There are so many different kind of people involved in business. No one can say what is in other people's mind. Follow her orders.. at the same time keep an eye on mother. You should come and report me about where mother goes.. ..and with whom does she go out.. am I clear? Okay, sir.. can I go now, sir? Do you understand Dutta? This is called senility. What are you saying? That poor man must have asked her.. ..for help.. so she might have helped him.. ..Help indeed.. I wish I would get a lady who would help me like this. You are talking rubbish.. ..It seems that you are very much obedient of your madam. Do you know that now a days madam is going to a hotel.. ..everyday after office.. ..there she chats with that man for.. ..almost 2 hours and then goes back home. How do you know? One needs to know.. do you understand, brother? Sin can never be hidden.. first witness is our driver Mahadev. Then everybody started talking about it. From the driver to the watchman.. ..from the watchman to the lift man.. ..then from the liftman to the.. ..peon of our department.. from the peon to me.. ..from me to you.. and from you to the rest of the office. Please keep quite.. why do we need to know about all these? Sir, can I come in? Come in. Sir, a bill has come from Nancy hotel in madam's name. From which account do we do this payment? Show me.. - This is it. Let this be with me now.. I'll tell you later what to do. Okay, sir. Oh it's you.. sit down. Hello.. yes.. no.. okay.. cancel it. Sit down. Whose is this bill? Oh. Do you want any explanation from me? No.. I just only want to know. This bill is for me.. the person staying over there is my guest. I have made arrangements for him to stay over there. I see. Accounts section had forwarded the bill to me and wanted to know that.. ..from which account the payment will be made. My personal account. Do you want to know anything else? No. How long will you keep me away from you like this? Why are you so impatient, dear? I'll come to you when the right time will come. Yes please. I want the name and address of the person.. ..staying at room number 302. But sir. You know what sir? Ray Chaudhury was caught red handed from my flat.. ..then he was having a fight with his wife. So I had let him stay over here. After all he was my colleague.. but the saddest part was that.. ..the poor thing was sentenced to jail for 3 years. Well Mr. Gupta.. when did Mr. Ray Chaudhury.. ..come here for the last time? Few days back.. he came suddenly and went away suddenly. He didn't tell me where he went. Bye, Mr. Gupta. Sorry for disturbing you.. ..please don't mind.. Not at all. One more thing.. since you are from police. Is there any scope of more problem? No.. no.. you don't worry. You came for the first time.. at least have a cup of tea. No thanks. &quot;Don't make mistake; please don't make mistake.&quot; &quot;Don't make a mistake in love.&quot; &quot;You will regret it..&quot; Has mother come back? No. Now a days mother is coming back home late. Probably the work pressure in the office has increased. Instead of going to the club and parties.. ..you can help mother-in-law. Sujata.. Sujata if we go somewhere. What do you mean by 'go somewhere'? I mean settle some where else. - Where? Europe, America, Australia.. or any other continent. Why in some other continent? Because the earth of this country is sweeping away from beneath our feet ..Sujata, today I am missing father a lot. I feel that of father was alive then I wouldn't have to carry.. ..this load of stigma on my head like this, Sujata. What has happened to you, tell me. Why are you saying all these? I am suffering from the pain growing inside me. I can't bear this any longer, Sujata. What happened? - Mother. What happened to mother-in-law? I myself don't know what has happened to her. My heart doesn't want to believe. But I don't have the courage not to believe. Please tell me clearly, what has happened. There are rumours in the whole office about my mother's movements.. ..and I have got the proofs.. ..that these rumours are not base less. What are you saying? Yes.. that's it.. I had seen the man first time.. ..in mother's chamber.. mother took the vagabond like man.. ..along with her and went out in front of me. That attitude of mother set my heart ablaze. Did you get to know anything of that man? That man is convict who was sentenced to jail for 3 years. What disastrous thing are you talking about? My mother-in-law is like a goddess.. but ultimately she. What have you decided? About what? About my rehabilitation. Do you really want me or. You still distrust me. Can you give me a proof? What proof do you want? If I say that I'll give up all my wealth and come to you. Will you be able to accept me then? Test me once. Sri. I was floating away like a twig. You'll help me to live.. ..before dying at least I'll be able to say. No. Listen, don't go out of the hotel at all on the days.. ..when I won't come.. then I'll make all arrangements.. ..and come to you.. okay? Okay.. as you say. Malati. Malati.. has my son come back from the club? Yes.. long time back. - Where is daughter-in-law. In your room. My room? What are they doing in my room? Madam, I am afraid. What are you afraid of? Your son was saying that he wants to take up a job in abroad and go away.. ..your daughter-in-law was asking him to talk to you clearly. What happened, Sujata? Please sit down first, mother. First I want to know what all you have heard. Mother, you don't know what you re saying. I know everything. There are rumours all around you.. your name is attached.. ..to the filthy man's name.. do you know that, mother? All around? What all around? All around whom? Who is there all around? You were 3 years old then. I used to carry you in my arms and used to roam around.. ..the streets of this city in order to sell lac-dye and vermillion. Then who were there around us to take care of us? And now I have brought you up and standing.. ..with my head held high. now when I have got my peace of mind. Then do I have to listen to what people all around say? But mother, people will ask many questions about the man. I won't answer any one. Mother-in-law, you love me more than your own child. I have also never thought you anything other than my mother. Please tell me, who is that man. Aand why do you have so much weakness for that man? He is everything to me. But I have heard that the gentleman was on a.. ..jail sentence for 3 years. How can you call him a gentleman? A person who had stolen 10,000 rupees.. ..from his office and was sentenced to jail. He can't be called a gentle man. He is just a man. How do you come to know? I went to circus lane. Why? To enquire about that man. Where did you get the address from? From the hotel. Now you tell me don't you go to the hotel everyday.. ..after office and spend hours with that man? Yes, I do. Sriranjan. If I say that he is your father..? Mother.. please don't lie. You have taught me all your life to speak the truth.. ..and today you yourself are telling a lie. Shame on you, mother. Believe me, son. What will I believe? My father had died 26 years back. And today he became alive for some special reason? No, son, no.. he wasn't dead.. he got lost. You might discover your husband in that convict but.. ..I can never place him in the place.. ..of my dead father, mother. Wait. Wait.. I accept all your allegations. Now you tell me, what punishment.. ..do you want to give me. Mother, please save me. From this painful situation I don't know father, mother. You haven't kept even a photograph so that I can imagine about him. I don't want anything else from you, mother. Just please leave that filth man whose surname.. ..is also Ray Chaudhury. At this situation it's not possible for me to leave that.. ..sick and weak man alone, son. Then you'll have to leave us, mother. Okay. Whatever you want will happen. I'll not stop it. What have you decided? I'll make a will and give them all my property. It will take time for the formalities to be done. So I have told my lawyer to let me know on time. I'll send my address later. Then I'll come back and sign on the.. ..papers and complete all the formalities and go back. Where will you go now? Benaras. He has spent most of the time of his life over there. He knows the place and the people over there. After all it will be a old man and old woman's family. We'll manage it somehow moreover I'll try to get a job of a teacher. What do you say? What do I have to do? You have to do the last thing for me. Sister-in-law. Of course you'll have to do it you are my comrade of my struggle. Who else other than you will do it? What is that? You have to deliver the news to my son.. ..tell him that I have left for Benaras. Okay, I'll do that. One more thing. Give him the news after we leave. Okay.. as you wish. Sister-in-law. You had to fight all your life. Now may god give you peace. &quot;You were hiding inside my heart.&quot; &quot;I couldn't see you.&quot; &quot;I couldn't see you.&quot; &quot;You were hiding inside my heart.&quot; &quot;I couldn't see you.&quot; &quot;I couldn't see you.&quot; &quot;My eyes had searched for you outside.&quot; &quot;Outside the house..&quot; &quot;But I have never looked inside my heart.&quot; &quot;You were hiding inside my heart.&quot; &quot;In my love and in all my hopes and sorrows..&quot; &quot;In my love and in all my hopes and sorrows..&quot; &quot;You were there with me.&quot; &quot;I didn't come to you.&quot; &quot;You were there with me..&quot; - Give me. Give me. Sri. Tell me. Our son, daughter-in-law. Won't they come? Let's not talk about them. Why? I have come to you.. haven't I? let's not talk about them. Won't I see them for once? You have gone down in their eyes. I couldn't tolerate that insult. Sri. Aunty.. aunty. is late night now.. mother-in-law hasn't returned.. ..my husband hasn't returned too.. I am afraid. Did you call the office? ..mother-in-law has gone out somewhere from the office in the afternoon. And my husband hasn't gone to the office at all today. Then where did he go? Where were you all day long? What is mother doing? Mother-in-law? She hasn't returned home yet. What are you saying? But I saw mother's car in the garage. Mother-in-law has left the car in the afternoon.. ..and had gone away somewhere from the office. What do you mean by 'went away'? Couldn't you search for her? - Where will I search for her? You could have called up uncle. Even uncle is also not at home a man came and gave this letter for you. He has told particularly that I should.. ..give you the letter to you as soon as you come back. It's very urgent. 'Dear, Sriranjan. You haven't recognised you mother yet. The man whom you are thinking is filthy.. ..regarding whom you are thinking your mother is wrong.. ..is actually your father our Priyada. All my life I have followed your mother's orders. But I couldn't follow her last order. Sister-in-law had ordered me to give you the news.. ..after I see them off in the Punjab mail. It's too late now.. let's give it a last try.. come on. Father. Mother-in-law. - Mother. Father.. father. Mother-in-law. - Father. Uncle..? Where is mother? You came at last.. but you are late. Where is mother, uncle?
