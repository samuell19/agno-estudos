THE MERRY WIDOW Your attention please. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen. In exactly five seconds, we can welcome the twentieth century. Should auld acquaintance be forgot and never brought to mind? GERMAN IMPERIAL EMBASSY Should auld acquaintance be forgot, and never brought to mind? THE CHINESE EMBASSY Should auld acquaintance be forgot and never brought to mind? ROYAL EMBASSY OF MARSHOVIA 2nd Floor Happy New Year. - The same to you, your excellency. Should we take one more in honor of your majesty? Telegram. Make sure that he is not a bill collector. What is it? - A cable for the Marshovian ambassador. Don't take it if it is collect. - Collect? Been paid. It's from the king. - The king. And it's in code. - Take the book. It probably to wish us a happy New Year. That's actually very thoughtful of him. Now we must have that little extra drink. The first word? Darling. - Darling? Darling. Darling. Darling, darling. Darling, darling. Ah, here it is, darling. You are the biggest idiot in the diplomatic service. You forget yourself? But these are his majesty's exact words. It is from the book. Next word? Here is the whole message. Decode it. Larki. Larki. In my medicine kit in my bathroom there is a small bottle with poison. Take it out and hide it. Well, what does he say? You are the biggest idiot in the diplomatic service. There are only three marshovians in the U.S. Two are penniless. One died leaving 80 million dollars to his widow, she is in New York. Good Morning. - Good Morning. We have come to see to Mrs. Radek. This gentleman... Do you have an appointment? - I am sure she will be delighted to see us. Mrs. Radek is not at home. We will wait. - No visitors without an appointment. What seems to be the trouble, Paki? Miss Riley, these gentlemen insist on seeing Mrs Radek. What can I do for you? I am Mrs. Radeks secretary. Our mission is private. - I'm her private secretary. And personal. - I am her personal secretary. We just have to talk to her privately and personally. You see this matter is confidential. I am her confidential secretary too. Confidentially I suggest that you write her a personal appointment and state your private business. I appreciate your.. - I realise it is very important. You must be anxious to get that letter written, so I won't detain you any longer. Thank you. Thank you very much. Why did I thank her for? Thank you. Paki would you help with the parcels please? Kitty, Kitty I'm back. Hello. - Hello. I have two tickets to "Captain James." I hear Ethel Barrymore is just one core. - Were there any calls? Yes, the Opera Association called. There are a couple of papers to sign and two gentlemen were here. I just got rid of them. Looked like a tax. Madame Radek, at last. We have been most anxious to see you. These are the gentlemen I told you about. Oh yes. I understand your business is confidential? It is more than that madame, it is a matter of the heart. And what charity do you represent? - Charity? We come to give, not to get. This gentleman is the Marshovian ambassador, a minister private pensionary to the United States. This is my attach√© and personal assistant. Marshovia. Well, how do you do gentlemen? Won't you come in? What can I do for you? - Forgive our intrusion madame, but our excuse must be the place that Charles Radek holds in the heart of his countrymen. - Won't you be seated? Marshovia never forgets her sons. We hope your husband did not forget Marshovia. He had the most pleasant memories of it. You would be pleased to hear that his majesty is erecting a statue. To Charlie? Will you honor his majesty by coming to Marshovia, to preside at the unveiling? A statue to Charlie. Oh, he would have been very pleased. After all he was only a blacksmith in Marshovia. But an industrial giant in America. There was a charming little square near the station. It it still there? - Madame has been to Marshovia? Oh never, but Charlie talked about it to me. You know, he once shot the king's horse there. And that little inn across the way? The innkeeper had to pay him with cakes. Charlie used to watch the nobility when they had their parties at the inn. Now the nobility will watch Charles Radick. His Majesty has chosen that very square for the statue. That will be very nice. Thank his Majesty. I am very proud to accept his most gracious invitation. Thank you, madame. Trumpets will sound. An entire nation will be there to welcome you. Follow me, follow me, follow me to a land where the whiskey is free. Around your neck like a necklace of pearls hang the girls, girls, girls, girls. What can I inter share with the world? I can take any port in a storm. Just as long as the girls are as warm as the wine every girl is my valentine. Drink it down, drink it down, drink it down through the purse leather purse of a gown. To the lips and the eyes at the girls, of the girls, girls, girls, girls, girls. Love they say is a state of the mind and my mind for the girls is inclined. If I kissed only one, that would not be polite. So I kiss all the girls tonight. When we match down the streets a parade. We erect we inspect the facade. And my heart like a batter of birds to the girls. Girls, girls, girls. For not all of his medals were won on the run with a sword or a gun. They were won from the start in affairs of the heart. And today I will play my heart. Men, this is an important occasion. Mrs. Radek first impression of Marshovia will be this reception. I challenge each of you to outdo himself, for the honor of king and country. Ready. Attention. Present arms. Silence. Silence. Rest weapons. Break ranks. Come on, come on, hurry. Fast, fast. Attention. Present arms. Stop, stop. Nitki. How long are we supposed to wait here? His majesty said all week if necessary. - Very well. Rest weapons. Men, we are supposed to remain here a week if necessary. Attention. Why... There is no one here to meet us. It looks like the place from what Charlie used to say. But is it? Is this Marshovia? What else could it be? Trumpets will sound, an entire nation will welcome you. It isn't their fault that the train is a little late. A little late? As far as I can figure that is still yesterday's train. Fourteen days on a boat, eight days on a train, if you call it a train. And this is a way they put down the red carpet. Maybe I can get us a ride to the palace. Vilia, oh, Vilia, your love is a flame. Soft as a kiss, hear me whisper your name. Vilia, oh, Vilia, my heart calls to you. Where is the love song we knew? Dance, little gypsy, and so weave your spell. All men must love you, not wisely but rare. Vilia, oh, Vilia, my lovely, my all. Love me and be mine not all. Dance, little gypsy, and so weave your spell. All men must love you, not wisely but rare. Vilia, oh, Vilia, my lovely, my all. Love me and be mine not all. Be mine not all. Mine not all. Crystal. Crystal. Come on, get on. The welcome committee is ready if you are. That man, the one who was singing, what is his name? Danilo. Danilo. Are you sure you were expected? You saw the invitation and the king's signature. Maybe it was faked. I never did trust that ambassador. It is funny. A palace with nobody in it. It looks more like Grand Central Station to me. All the morning anguish... It worked. Pardon, pardon, are you the rich ladies from America? We are from America. Oh, and you find us asleep. What a catastrophe. But we have been expecting you since early morning. If we had walked we have gotten here sooner. In Marshovia, the right train always comes the wrong time. Your rooms are ready. This way please. His Majesty planned to greet you in person but he too must have fallen asleep. If the king heard that I dosed off.. Don't worry we won't tell him. Who is this man? What are you doing here? - He brought us from the station. Did nobody meet you? Nobody. - Not the honor guard? Not the blessed garoons, the hussars, the royal band? It doesn't matter. We're here. But they were going to sing the star-bangled banner. Count Danilo. He was in charge of the reception. Did you not see him? Well, I heard him singing at the inn. But it was not the star-bangled banner. - Wait till the king hears of this. Welcome to your home in Marshovia. Now I shall wake the king. Have orders to bring news of your arrival. Oh no. Wait till tomorrow. - Very well. My instructions are to please you. And now I have to honor to wish your highnesses goodnight. Thank you. Oh, Kitty. Is it not wonderful? You can buy this palace ten times over. But money can't buy this. Look at this room. It's a birthday cake room. And look Kitty. Everybody came to the party. Sure. That's why they couldn't meet the train. - Who cares? Where did you ever get off a train, to find all the people singing and dancing? Not in Hoboken, where I come from. No, not in Yonkers either. But I didn't have to come from the station in a car. It doesn't matter, what if the trains are late? Nobody is there to meet. At least the people know how to live. They have time to sing, to dance. Oh, that is something out of a book, Kitty. I'll rip the hide of that Danilo. I told him how important it was to impress the widow. Not to mention the fact that it costs a pretty penny to prepare the reception. Oh, that Danilo. He'll regret this till the end of his life. If he lives that long. - Hermann. Stop hallowing. You run the palace, I run the government. Where do you think we can find him? I couldn't say for sure your majesty, but I have a few ideas. So have I. We go to mine first. My hat. - Yes. Yes sir. No, no, no, your majesty. You know, I never wear my crown in the street. I'm busy. - Open the door. Who is it? - Open in the name of his majesty. Yes, tell his majesty I'm sorry, but... Is Count Danilo in there? - Just a minute I'll see. I can tell the rest of your fortune too: you are about in trouble with a big fat king. I might have known I couldn't rely on you. A fine officer you are, neglecting your duty. I ought to rip the stars of your uniform. Where is your uniform? Here it is. What are you good for anyway? Nothing. Except to run around after women. I don't run after them sir, they run after me. It's the family curse. You're just like your father. - My father, sir? Your brother. And just like your grandfather. - Your father. I know, I know, that's the problem with your side of the family. I wonder why I put up with you? - Well, I'm a relative, sir. The only talent you have is to make women fall in love with you and I warn you. Danilo, my dear nephew, we must have a long talk. You may yet prove a credit to Marshovia. Kitty. Are you awake? I have a date to go dreaming... with someone I never know. Tonight, put your white tie and pailes on, and be my chaperone. Night, do a favor just for me, lift your veil and let me see my love. Night, light your candles in the sky. Did I hear a lady sigh above? Love is a serenade that may fade with the moon. Night, one more favor for a friend. Please, don't let this evening end... too soon. I have a life to live and I give it to love. Night, I'm waiting your reply. Please, do not let her tell me no... or I'll shall die. What's going on here? Count Danilo. Count Danilo. Your Majesty, I'll give my life for Marshovia. I will do anything. I'll fight alone against our enemies... - We do not have enemies. Only creditors. - This woman is not for me. Exile me, do something drastic, but don't do this. Oh, she can't be that bad. Our ambassador has cabled us that the widow Radek is charming and attractive. Our ambassador is an old man. There is a difference in points of view. I am not asking you to fall in love with the woman, marriage is quite enough. If we don't pay what we owe, the emperor of Austria is threatening to march in and make us a province. I know, your majesty, but.. - Enough, Count Danilo. You're under orders. You will return to your apartment at once and first thing in the morning you receive further instructions and this is a command, Danilo. You will woo and wed the widow Radek. I may wed her, your majesty, but I won't woo. "Count Danilo will bring to the widow Radek... one bunch long stamp freshly cut dark roses." I cut them myself. - How nice. Thank you. "In the roses will be a card with appropriate settings." His majesty wrote it himself, all you have to do is sign it. Does the king really believe, that a woman would fall for this kind of a courtship? I don't know. Mittzy, come here. Tell me the truth. Would you fall for this? If it were you captain Danilo, I'd follow in a minute. Yes. - Shall I continue with the program, captain? It is not a program, it is a death sentence. "At 12.30 take the widow Radek for a ride in the park." "Undress uniform". Thank you. "2:00 PM lunch at the officer's club." "4.30 PM horseback riding near the river." No uniform. Civilian riding habit. "8.00 PM official banquet to welcome the widow Radek. Full dress uniform. Wear boots comfortable for dancing". It is all arranged eh? Like the train schedule. But she doesn't know it. - Too bad she doesn't. It's time to get dressed, captain Danilo. Wait a minute, what do you think, you are? - It is a military command from his majesty. It's inhuman. Inhuman. I never thought the king was so romantic. Listen. "At precisely 11.00 AM Captain Danilo will bring to the widow Radek one bunch long stamp freshly cut dark roses." She will fall for that in a minute. It's a cruel to honor a man to make a man. Poor Count Danilo, I'm afraid he's hooked. Unless... I was wondering... - So was I. Do you think? - I think. Good morning, your excellency. - Hello, Susan. For madame Radek Do you take care of her? Gladly, your excellency. Such beautiful roses. They are taller than I am. - You know I like my roses taller and women to think. Confidentially, Susan, how does she look? Very rich. Well, announce me. Your excellency Count Danilo is here, madame. - Tell him just a minute. Danilo. That's the fellow who's serenading us last night. Oh, the second story man. It's going to take me some time. What I can do? You go talk to him till I'm ready. I'll get dressed and take care of him. - No no, no, don't keep him waiting. Put that on and tell him I'll be right out. Kitty, don't make jokes about the serenade. It must be one of their customs. Remember charming, behave yourself. Don't worry, I have the manners of a duchess when I set my mind to it. Count Danilo. Madame. I'm here as the king's emissary to make you happy and comfortable in Marshovia. I am at your service to entertain, to amuse, to give pleasure. But captain Danilo... - Please, stop. I am forced to say what is in my heart. Last night, when I came to sing for your window, it was at the request of my king. But when I saw you, you were lovely by moonlight. You are lovelier now. I see a face and either I respond at once or I am permanently adamant. With me it is always and with you? I must say count it is thrilling for a simple American girl from Yonkers to hear such romantic talk, but is that your customary breeding? Believe me madame, I have never made a speech before in my life. Don't be annoyed, if you find me too impetuous. I have to see you again. At 12.30 I will honor myself by taking you for a ride in the park. Goodbye, dear lady, only a little while. Goodbye. Why did he leave? I never saw anything like it in my life. - Why didn't you tell him I'll be right out? He didn't give me a chance. He just took one look at me and got carried away. You better carry him back. I want to meet him. Lovely roses. He'll be back. He's after something. You. But, Kitty, he's never really seen me. - Well that's just it. That man wasn't talking to me. He was making up to the rich Mrs. Radek. He was? - He was. Teaches you one thing, when they start kissing your hand, hold on to your bracelet. Kitty you're always suspicious of people. Not people, just men. Danilo is a count, a rich man. What would he want with my money? Who knows? A penny here, a penny there. "11 o'clock, bring roses, make speech." What are you talking about? "12.30, take widow for ride in the park ". Kings orders, you're official business. "8:00 PM, state banquet, to welcome the widow Radek." "Remember Danilo, beauty passes, but 80 million dollars wisely invested remains". They pretended, they wanted to do something wonderful for Charlie, to honor him. And I melt. Charlie didn't mean a thing to them, except money. And that's all I mean to them. And I don't like it. - I don't like it either. I'd have enough of this place. I want to be treated like a person, not a cash register. Forget Marshovia. You can't even find another man. Remember we have all of Europe in front of us, Rome, Vienna, Paris... Oh, I can't understand a man like Danilo. But you must admit he is handsome. Now that you mention it, he is very handsome. Maybe that's important to you, but not to me. The most important thing in a man is character. - It is? I mean it is. I guess it would be easy for most women to look ahead for a man like Danilo. A count, charming, fascinating... Silly, isn't it? - What silly? To be interested in a man, because he is good looking. Charming, fascinating. - And tall too. He is quite tall, did you notice? I noticed. And romantic too. Very romantic. Three more words and you are going to talk yourself right out of 80 million dollars. Why did I have to find that note? - It's the best thing that ever happened. Attention, mes dames et messieurs. A votre gauche: Paris. A votre droit: France. Special price 8.95, reduced to 9. A votre droit: Broken clock, 16:15. A votre gauche: Statue of Kate Riley, "American girl soaking her feet." 3rd century BC. If this is Paris, you can have it. We came here for a good time. - Now you're talking. When do we start? Oh, the minute I start being the merry widow, they'll all be chasing my money. Oh, let them chase me, I haven't got any money. Kitty. Would you? Sure, I always wanted to act like I had 80 million. Oh. Wonderful. And you can start right now. Have you a little moment for me, Mrs. Radek? A big moment if you like. Charming woman Mrs. Radek, so very gracious. I hope she likes me. - How could she help it? You're a dear thing, but I must not let that pretty face turn my head. Can't afford it? - You're a clever girl. We trust each other? We are friends? Good. Will you help me out? With Mrs. Radek? - Yes. What is it about Mrs. Radek? All the men run after her. Can it be love? Well, I don't know about the others, but with me it's strictly for the money. Count Danilo, welcome to Paris. - Hello, Pierre. Excuse me. Marshovian Embassy made your reservations. I hope you find it on your arrival? - No please don't. Not a word to anybody. Kitty. - Yes? Get your dressing. We will be late for the opera. We're getting out of Paris tomorrow. What happened? Have you killed somebody? Not yet, but I'm going to. Danilo, he is in Paris. At this very hotel. Just arrived. He's following me. - I don‚Äôt believe it. I saw him downstairs. I suppose he's here. A lot of people come to Paris for a lot of reasons. His reason is me. Don't get so upset, he probably doesn't even know you're here. If he's chasing anybody, he's chasing me. - He's chasing 80 million dollars. So was Crillon. - But at least Crillon was honest about it. Come in. For Madame Radek, compliments of the count. I guess put them there on the table please. Crillon is a fast worker. He must be awfully broke to be in such a hurry. What's the matter? - You were right. The sun left Marshovia when you left. I followed the warmth, the brightness of your face. I must see you again. Danilo. He will see me alright. Where are you going? - To tell him what I think. You're taking the vase? - And use it. Don't cause a scandal. They kick us out of the hotel. I'll find a place, but I will be going. - Crystal. I have nothing on. Why didn't you tell me? - I thought you 'll find out. You loose your temper, hit him on the head and sued for a million. He's not going to take me all over Europe. - Well, let me handle it. Alright. But tell him you 're not the real widow. I am. I'll tell him plenty. Now go and get dressed. And be firm. Hard. As hard as steel. The marshovians are given a lot of air. Don't melt. - Cold as ice. And when you see Danilo, rip him apart. - Like a tiger. Girls, girls, girls, girls. Our ambassador in Paris, your highness. Ah, come in, baron Popoff, come in. Count Danilo. You were to report to me the moment you arrived in Paris. I have just sent flowers to Mrs. Radek with appropriate sentiments from you. Well, thank you. - It's quite alright.I thank you for nothing. Now I will pave the way for you to see her tonight. No not tonight, Popoff. Tonight is my own. That's quite impossible. - With his majesty's consent. Nitki. - Yes, sir? Is that so? - Yes, your excellency. But we have no time to lose, Danilo. Even now this very instant she maybe saying "yes" to someone else. They are all after her. The Marquis de Savoie, Count Crillon, that improper ambassador from Austria-Hungary. All bold men. - And brave. May the greediest win. It will serve them right. This is treason your highness. - Popoff. You are a diplomat. Think. There must be a way out for me. - There is no way out. With honor. - Then with dishonor. You forget yourself Danilo. You are a soldier, an officer. And you have been chosen to save king and country. At ease. Well, if I must I must. Tonight I refuse to be depressed. Surely you're losing your sense of proportion. Who can be depressed by a woman, who has at least... I know, I know. 80 million dollars. It is more important than that. The widow Radek owns 52% of every cow in Marshovia. And I love every cow in Marshovia, but I do not love the widow Radek. This is cold blooded feet, Danilo. When you like her or not, you love her. The Government I represent, your loyal heart can't just declaim so to the widow I have send a dozen roses in your name. Regretfully I must decline the widow Radek to pursue. I've got a heart for head and wine, but not the head or heart to woo. Consider, sir, without offense, the diplomatic consequences. Let devil take diplomacy and leave the ladies all to me. I'm going to Maxim's, where all the girls are dreams, a sentimental army to captivate and charm me. Lolo, Dodo, Joujou, Cloclo, Margot, Froufrou. I promise to surrender my biggle heart to you. The champagne I will set, set, set, could sink a battle ship. And as I woo each top off, they pop like Baron Popoff... and so, comme Si comme √ßa, I go tout de suite Ce soir. Accept my bold adieu, sir. To you, sir, Au revoir. I'm going to Maxim's to squander my centimes. To look the ladies over like honeybees in clover. Mimi, Fifi, Ivette and pretty Nicolette, tonight we live and love and tomorrow we regret. The music of Maxim's, I hear it in my dreams, the tantalizing whisper of petticoats and bustle. Lolo, Dodo, Joujou, Cloclo, Margot, Froufrou. The heart I lost to Paris tonight I give it to you. Maxim's. A car, ma'am? Voiture. Where to, madam, the opera? - Maxim's. Opera. - Cabby, Maxim's. Very well, ma'am, horses go. This is it, madam. And now that madame has seen it, we better hurry, she'll be late for the opera. Oh, but I'm going in. I think that is most unfortunate. You can go in without an escort. It's a bit... Most irregular. What about those other women? Oh, singers, dancers. They work at Maxim's. Oh, I see. Just a moment. - Very well, ma'am. Wait for me. - Very well, ma'am. Ritanti, Ritantirelle, Ritanti, Les mademoiselles. Ritanto Ritantiri... So do not say "End the happy Paris." Danilo. Danilo. Hello, girls. Hello. I'm home again, Maxim's. If only had more arms, let's say twenty-three or -four arms, they all be holding you, Lolo, Dodo, Froufrou. But pity poor Danilo he only has but two. The ladies of Maxim's are generous, it seems. They take a poor amigo, and exercise his ego, Mimi, Kiki, Ivette, Cloco and Nicolette. Tonight we live and love and tomorrow we regret. Did you miss me, girls? - Yes. Well, who else buys as much champagne and caviar as you do? Marcela. Marcela. And tonight I'm on an expense account. When did you get to Paris? - This afternoon. Oh, Marcela, I feel like a new man already. I never minded the old one. Would you like to dance? - Yeah. May I have a light? - Well... Of course. Not bad. Not bad at all. Who is she? - Sais pas. I have never seen her. See you later, Marcela. Haven't I met you before? - If you had, you remembered. Would you like a drink? - Alright. I assure you, I am going to recognise you next time. I may be dressed differently. - Oh, don't worry. I have a very very good memory for a pretty face. You know girls who sit at my table, don't flirt with other men. Well, you can change your mind if you want, Marcela is still waiting. Sit down. What's your name? Fiffi. You're the precioust Fiffi I ever met. What's your name? Don't you know me? Should I? - I'm Danilo. At Maxim's and you've never heard of me? You must be very very new here. You are not French. English? - American. An American at Maxim's? A lot of Americans come to Paris and the happier they are the more money they spend. How clever of Maxim's. You know, I'm a tourist myself. A Marshovian. A banker perhaps? No, we have no bankers in Marshovia. Oh, what a pity. And I was so in a mood for a banker tonight. Oh, you funny Americans, all you think of is money, money, money. What comes first to you? Love? Always. You are funny Marshovians, such idealists. An old Marshovian custom. I am glad to know there is something nice about Marshovia. Good evening, Count Danilo. - Hello, Paul. Thank you, Count Danilo. For "Madame", with monsieurs compliments. Did you sent this to my table? - For the lady. And it was no concern of yours. You know this can be a very expensive bottle of champagne. The lady is my wife, we have five children. Pardon, monsieur. Oh, that's alright. I'm not offended. You would love the children. Well, Fiffi, ready for dinner? Come along. - Not at Maxim's? Well, it must be very new to you. The dining rooms are upstairs, unless you would rather not. Well of course. We are supposed to keep the customers happy. And I am a very good client. Oh, no, no. - Come here. But he is such a bore. - You wanted Danilo? A cozy little place you have here. It's simple, but it's home. I have to talk to Maxim. Bright lights make the place so cold. It's warm enough to me. You know, Fiffi? It makes me nervous to have anybody follow me. Afraid? Of course not. - That's good. Oh, now really this is absolutely demoralizing. Come over here, sit down and be a good girl. What's the matter with you? I do not understand you. No, you wouldn't, but I understand you. You think you're so irresistible, that every woman is ready to swoon at your feet. Not at all. There is really nothing romantic about a fainting woman. And you are such a romantic man. You, the great lover. A glass of champagne buys a kiss, is that it? This is absurd. Oh, all you know about love is to pay for it or to be paid for it. My dear Fiffi, I haven't insulted you. Why are you insulting me? After all you needed help to join me. And you are free to go. That is a very gallant speech, but if I am free to go, unlock that door. It isn't locked. I want to apologise. I'm afraid I made a fool of myself. The important thing is that you came back. Come on, let's make up. It's the nicest part of a quarrel. Your first time here? - Yes. What are you, really? Well, I'm a chorus girl. In what show? Well.. I haven't been in one for some time. Oh, I see. You were broken and you came to Maxim's. Oh, that's why you wanted a banker. I'm the wrong man, Fiffi. I haven't a franc to my name. I never cared before, but... Right now for the first time, I wish I had that sort of money. To help you. I'm sorry. And I'm sorry I ruined your evening. Just a moment. Why don't you stay and have dinner with me? No strings attached, not a string. I like you to stay. Will you? Yes. Still afraid? - No. Though I try love, would deny love. Yes, I care. Cause I dare not say I care not when I care. So I'll tell the music why I hold you near. Who convey what I can't say, I love you, dear. You smile at me and then I'm 17 again. And though it appear naive I make believe that I believe. Stars that twinkle in the sky tonight that's winkling in your eyes. While heaven smiles above we dream of love. Nor I try dear, to deny dear, I love you. Still I dare not say I care not when I do. I tell the music while you hold me near. To convey what I can't say. I love you, dear. Do you love me, Danilo? - Of course I do. I mean it, seriously. Oh, yes, I love you. For how long? Forever. And tomorrow? - Forget tomorrow. This is tonight. Fiffi. Fiffi. Come on, arre, arre. Fiffi. Fiffi, wait. Where do you live, Fiffi? Miss Riley. Miss Riley. Did you and Mrs. Radek have a pleasant evening? I can safely say that Mrs. Radek hasn't a complaint in the world. Did you mention me to her? I'm afraid I have bad news, Count Crillon. It isn't official. But I can guarantee that Mrs. Radek has decided to marry Count Danilo. Danilo. That fortune hunter? - It is a bit shocking. But I don't understand, how did he do it? Well, I rather not answer that question. But what does Danilo got that I have not? Well, for one thing he's got Mrs. Radek. It's terrible, isn't it? I'm looking for a woman. - In a police station? Why don't you try down the avenue, monsieur. There is a little caf√© most discrete. No, I have lost a woman and I try to find her. Your wife? - No. No wonder monsieur is upset. What is her name? - Fiffi. Charming. Fiffi what? Well, it never occurred to me to ask her her last name. Romantic, but not practical. Was your date an informant or did monsieur get a good look at her? A very good look. - And? Yes. - Monsieur is very fortunate. Any birthmarks? I just met the lady and she is a lady. Missing one lady. Answers to the name of Fiffi. No visible birthmarks. This is going to be very difficult. Paris is full of women named Fiffi with no visible birthmarks. She's an American. That is different. How tall? Well, about this. Long legs. Yes, how did you know? All American women have the long legs. From the waist down an American woman is incomparable. From the waist up the advantage is all with the French women. Oh, I assure you sergeant, from the waist up she is completely French. This is living, monsieur. You are lucky to find a woman like that. Yeah, but I cant find her. Don't worry. She will turn up. I can see her now. Tall, blonde, blue eyes with a lovely sprinkle... The lobe of the ear sticking out below the golden hair. Just waiting to be kissed. Temptation, yes, elusive. That's her. That's Fiffi. Do you know her? No, but I can dream, can't I? Oh sergeant, please, can you find her? Sorry. It's not my job, monsieur. What? How do you dare. I come here for help and all you do is waist my time dreaming. You. You idiot. Idiot? I? - Yes, you. When you insult me, you insult France, monsieur. Ah, don't be an imbecile. Arrest this man. You'll here about this from the Marshovian embassy. Who heard about the Marshovian embassy? Put in jail. Drink another cup of coffee. - I won't. I won't drink another drop of coffee, if I got manslaughter for it. In the name of his majesty, the King of Marshovia, I command you to drink this cup of coffee. I don't need it. I haven't been drinking. I'm perfectly sober. - Sober. Getting arrested, making a fool of yourself over a woman who's name you don't even know. It would take a miracle to find her. - That's what I need, a miracle. What you need another cup of coffee. Here drink this. If you won't help me find her, I will find her myself. I thought you were my friend? Unfortunately I'm not your friend, I am your commander. My boy you are now under orders, on his majesty's service. Oh, now be reasonable. Not today. Perhaps the American Embassy can help me. Count Danilo, you will follow instructions to the letter. But I don't... - If you don't I will revoke your visa and I will send him to Marshovia. And I promise you the king will cut off your allowance and assign you to garrison duty in Groknik. Groknik? - Groknik. I warn you, his majesty did not send you to Paris to chase Fiffi's. The widow Radek is our mission. Why you suppose we rented this? - Alright. Alright, alright. I will go back to the hotel and change my clothes. Just one moment, sir. I am going with you. Don't you trust me? - Funnily enough, I don't. Good morning, madame. Brioche still warm and crisp. Raspberries from Fontainebleau. One egg on toast l'Am√©ricain. What's going on here? It is the crack of dawn. Oh, I'm sorry I woke you. I'm going to that dress shop across the street. I haven't anything to wear. What's the matter, down your last Sabre coat? - Not me. I mean she hasn't anything. Fiffi, I told you last night Danilo thinks I'm a poor American chorus girl. Why did you get by with that? That's my suit. And your hat. But I have nothing else. How long are you going to keep this up? Why don't you make it easy for yourself? Tell him who you are. - Not yet. When he asks me, I want to be sure it is just me he's after. That makes sense. But how is he going to find you? He does not know who you are or where you are. But I know where he is. Fiffi. Fiffi. It is a miracle. That's what it is, a miracle. I said it would take a miracle to find her. - That's what you said. All night I was trying to find you, by morning I was crazy, wasn't I, Popoff? Insane. - Oh, I'll never let you out of my sight. I looked all over Paris. Well, it was easier for me to find where you were staying. And I came to say goodbye. I'm leaving for America. Oh, but you can't. I won't let you. Please, Fiffi, you've got to forget America and stay right here in Paris. What would I live on? Air? I'll solve it someway. Somehow. Let that be my responsibility. But last night you said you hate responsibility. I know I did, but I feel different now. I love you, Fiffi. But you said you'll only loved Maxim girls. Can't you forget what I said last night? Don't you see this is another man? I didn't want it to happen to me, but it has. I have fallen in love with you. For how long? For a day? How about tomorrow? Will you love me tomorrow? Oh, yes tomorrow, tomorrow, and tomorrow. Every minute, every day. Every year of my life. Popoff, not now. Orders. Remember Groknik. State business. The Ambassador wants me to make a speech. It sounds impressive. A speech that may make history for Marshovia. One of those silly diplomatic speeches. I'll make it short and fast and be right back. Come along. You can wait for me in my suite. - Oh, no. I can't. I mean I have some errands. Oh, but I don't want to lose you again. Will you have lunch with me? Two o'clock? Caf√© de Liszt? And remember one thing, the only important thing. I love you. She'll remember, she'll remember. Now upstairs and get dressed. My girl, you don't know what you're getting into with him. Here is 50... 100 francs. Buy yourself something. A ticket to Groknik. Connect me with Madame Radeks apartment. Oh, no. Danilo, I'm talking to you as a father. Why do you bother yourself with a girl like that Fiffi? As a man of the world I know what she is after. Money. You are a count. She thinks you are rich. Believe me that kind Al... Good morning, Madame Radek? This is Ignace Popoff, Marshovian ambassador. Come in. Good morning, Madame Radek. I'm at your command, dear lady. Did you say she was coming back to the hotel? What was he doing here? - I was just trying to locate you. What was Danilo doing here? He just proposed to me. He proposed to you? Oh, if this is a joke, it isn't very funny. He used all the right words love, marriage... Of course it wasn't just me he proposed to. I saw dollars signs dancing through the air. What did you say? What did you want me to say? I has stalled, so that I can think it over. He wants my answer tonight. There is a dance at the Marshovian embassy. Madame Radek is invited. "Dear Madame Radek, it would be the proudest moment of my life if I can announce our engagement before all our countrymen tonight." He tells me he loves me and in the next minute... I can't believe it. This is no place for us. We don't know the rules. Let's go home. Oh, no. No. I'm not going home. Besides I'm supposed to meet him for lunch. I'll see you later. Are you crazy? - Maybe. Maybe not. Danilo has had a lot of fun. Now it's my turn. At last. Every time you are out of my sight I think: "I shall never see her again." I never felt like this before. Like what, Danilo? - Unsure. Scared. It's a miserable feeling, Fiffi. Can it be love? More than I bargain for. - Tell me how much. Well, I myself don't know it. It's new to me. Tell me, Fiffi, do you feel the same way? No more doubts, no more questions? One more. But you've got to ask. A question? I ask? With most people, love and marriage go together. Well? Most people don't do what they choose. With me it is different. I have a duty to fulfill. But when it comes to love... - Oh, I see. A backstairs affair. - No, you don't see. It's not that way here. It's that way anywhere. Fiffi. I want to marry you. There is nothing else I ever wanted so much in my life. But I can't ask you now. I can't. Why not? Are you married? - No. Is there another woman? - No. Then ask me. Now, Danilo, right this minute. I can't. Fiffi, give me until tomorrow. I have to see you again, Fiffi. I must. Please. You'll see me again. - Promise? That's a promise. "Baron Popoff, Marshovian Ambassador to France Herman III, King of Marshovia, invites you to the reception and gala in honor of Madame Crystal Radek." Tonight is quite an occasion. Is his your daughter? My has she grown. Big big surprise later on. But stay secret. Enjoy yourselves. How are you? How are you? Any sign of the widow Radek? Report to me the moment her carriage arrives. Here I am, Baron Popoff. - Oh, your Excellency. Ready at last and at your service. - I trust you had a pleasant journey? Your room is satisfactory? You have unpacked? There is time enough for that tomorrow. Tonight I'll await your instructions. There was no need for you to rush to Paris. I have everything under control. This is Childs play to an old diplomat like myself. Pawns on a chessboard. I just move them at will. Masterful, Popoff, masterful. This will mean a decoration from the king. Oh, I haven't really given it a thought. Probably this one. Good looking, isn't it? Well enjoy yourself and consider yourself a guest. I have just a little last minute details to confirm. Nice to see you, my friend. Forgive me for keeping you waiting. Perfect. Charming, handsome, distinguished... But I like a slight air of secret sorrow. Women love a man who suffers. The widow isn't here yet. So go out, mingle with the guests. Dance, have a sandwich. Eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow you will be married. I will not marry the widow. I beg your pardon? I'm in love with another woman. That's normal. Who isn't? But what is being in love with one woman, has got to do with being married to another? Especially a rich one, as the widow. I won't marry the widow, because I'm not in love with the widow. Is that clear? Do not raise your voice. The ballroom is full of people. Is that clear? - But... Why didn't you say that, when his majesty gave you orders. I wasn't in love then. - Then this mistake is yours. It's a time of crisis for your country. - Crisis. The world won't come to an end because of me. But the kingdom of Marshovia may. Danilo, my dear friend. Well, this is a surprise. Have you left your position? I'm shocked. Popoff tells me, that this is a time of crisis. It's the crisis that brings me here. His Majesty has recalled me from Washington. The problem in Marshovia is most acute. It might explode at any moment. We are counting on you, my dear Danilo. A cable from his majesty. It is marked urgent. Urgent. Oh. It's in code. What's the first word? "Darling". - "Darling". You are the biggest idiot in the diplomatic service. Watch your tongue, sir. - It's in the book, I know. What? What is the next word? "Lilac time". "Lilac time..." "Engagement must be announced tonight." "I just received an ultimatum from Austria." "They want their money. She has it". Next? - "Happy Days". "Happy Days". "I warn you, don't fail me." "I demand good news when I arrive in Paris tonight or heads will roll." - He's coming here? The widow Radek has just arrived. Danilo, be reasonable. Change your mind. Did you know what it means "Happy Days"? Disaster for us all. I will not marry the widow Radek. But you leave me no alternative. Count Danilo is under arrest. Welcome, Madame Radek. - Welcome, Madame Radek. It's nice to see you again. You remember my friend, Miss Riley? Uh... Miss Riley? Oh, I... Excuse us. What? - Which one? New York? Madame Radek, I know you won't believe this, but When I met you this morning, I said to Danilo that is no Fiffi. "That is a lady of divergence and distinction." Didn't I, Danilo? And have you no word of welcome for the widow Radek, Count Danilo? I don't think we've ever really met. It's your Fiffi. Remember you said it would take a miracle to find her. Well this is the miracle. It's your little Fiffi. I know Fiffi, but Madame Radek is a stranger. Then you can get acquainted while you dance. Well, it's about time we did get acquainted. If Madame insists... Why did not you tell me about yourself? And why didn't you? I gave you every chance. I was hoping you would be honest with me. - How could I? To be in love with you and might have to choose someone else? How fortunate, you were not put to the test. Please, Danilo. I know how enchanted you are with our beautiful guest of honor, but it is your duty to open the dance. No one can started if you don't. Will Madame do me the honor? - Of course. Nor I try dear, deny dear, I love you. So I tell the music... While you hold me near... to convey what I can't say. I love you, dear. I'll tell the music when you hold me near to convey what I can't say. I love you, dear. Beautiful evening, Madame Radek. What is it, Fiffi? The trouble is I'm not Fiffi. I am the rich widow. You have to believe in me. How can I? 11:30, dance with Madame Radek. 12:00, propose to Madame Radek. Or am I to accept the proposal you made to another woman this morning? For 80 million dollars, I'm entitled to a first class proposal. I did have one. But I'm afraid it's isn't worth a penny, not for you. Perhaps you're wrong. Let me decide what it's worth. Go ahead, Danilo. Propose. You want me to crawl, don't you? Well, I won't. Money is to important to you. Guard it, hoard it. Be happy with it. What happened? Madame turned me down. Madame, we know he loves you and we know you love him. Whatever he has done that is wrong, whatever he has said. He's sorry. We'll see that he'll tells you himself. That he is sorry. Oh, you've underestimated him. For the first time, he stood on his own two feet and spoke out like a man. Forgive him, madame, he is no a diplomat. - Diplomat? It never occurred to you, that you cannot tell anyone whom to love and whom to hate? Then you are the biggest idiots in the diplomatic service. Darling. She read the cable. She read the cable. Take it easy, what's your hurry? The party is over. What happened? - Madame turned him down. I warned them. Heads will roll. What's he so excited about? - I've seen that face before. Let's get out of here. - Gladly, as soon as we leave. I told you, it's him, the king. He knows he's gonna get it now. Serves him right. It's a shame we're not there to watch the king ride into them. He was the maddest king I ever saw. Heads will roll. Heads will roll. What does it mean? - It's just an expression. They have some funny customs in Marshovia. Heads will roll. - Oh, don't be silly. They stopped chopping heads off 200 years ago. They are awfully backward in Marshovia. It's all your fault. He chases a woman all night long and when he catches her, he says Madame Radek is a stranger to me. No but you, you the great diplomat... She hates us all like poison. And I don't blame her. All you can say is: "It's your little Fiffi." In New York, I accomplished the impossible. I delivered the widow Radek to you. You blunderer. What will become of us. 35 years in the diplomatic service and in the end what? If I am lucky, I'm a waiter. With his majesty's compliments. You see? He has repented already. Cigars maybe? No bullets. He is trying to make us nervous. With his majesty's compliments. Where is the king? - I beg your pardon? I want to see the king, immediately. While the king is not the man, one requests an audience. Then, when his majesty graciously condescend... Look. I own 52 percent of Marshovia. As a matter of fact, I own 52 percent of you. Now where is the king? Forgive me, your majesty. Your majesty, I want to know... - Just a moment. Is it all over? No. But madame Radek insisted. Madame Radek? - What did you mean? Calm yourself, madame. You have the word of a king. Your honor and mine shall be satisfied. - Never mind. I just want to know one thing. What did you mean, "heads will roll"? Oh, that? Just an expression. I told you so. She thought maybe you meant... My dear Madame Radek, do you take us for barbarians? Do you think we still go around chopping off people's heads? Well, it was silly your majesty, but I had a trying evening. Forgive the intrusion, I was just a little nervous. Nothing to be nervous about. Give an officer a gun and a bullet and he knows what's expected of him. Your Majesty. Oh, my God. Did you say something? - No, nothing. Don't be hasty. Any of you got have 800 millions Drankas? It's the national debt. - Exactly. Where are we waisting time for? What else have we got? But... Excuse me for interrupting. A great king tempers justice with mercy. You are a pack of idiots, but I forgive you all. I should have handled this matter myself. A few minutes intelligent conversation with the generous madame Radek and the national debt is paid. The sun begins to shine on Marshovia. She's writing the check now. Where are you going? - To get the check of course. Good boy, you won't have to marry her now, my dear nephew. She won't have a penny left. - I am glad to hear it. I only hope the check is good for 800 million Drankas. Don't worry, your majesty, that is less than one million in American money. Now he tells me... Darling. Is the check ready? Yes. - May I have it? It seems to be correct. Thank you. Here it is. Good. Miss Riley. Out. Out? - Out. Out. There was a rich woman here a moment ago. A very rich woman. Her name was Madame Radek. But you took care of that. You finally got rid of her. I certainly did. And now, you haven't a penny. Have you? How do you know? The king just told me so. Well, if that's what the man said. The king said something else too. He said I don't have to marry the widow Radek now. Well that's understandable. I wouldn't be of any interest to a fortune hunter now, would I? You certainly wouldn't. The king understood that immediately. He is a very wise man. Wait a minute. That fortune hunter we were talking about, we got rid of him too. You really mean that? You know I do. I love you. Say it again. I say it again. I love you. I believe in magic when our hearts intertwine. Heaven is near when you are here and you are mine. THE END
