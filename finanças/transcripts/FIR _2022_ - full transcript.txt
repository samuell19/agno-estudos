Here is the anticipatory bail from the High Court... asking you not to arrest my client Prabhakar for another 15 days. - Hello, Uncle. - Welcome, Irfan. How nice of you to bring your mother's lunch. Madam! You're here for a case, Prarthana? How long are you going to continue assisting... that useless lawyer Gopi Narayanan? I keep waiting for you to take on your own case... and become a successful lawyer. You seem to be attending so many interviews... but don’t seem to land any jobs. Why is that? Look, I'm going to attend my 19th interview. This job is mine. If you don't get the job, let me know. I'm looking for an assistant to run my errands. I'll hire you. Don't forget the doctor's appointment this evening. But I'm busy! Not my problem. You better be there. You're a Type-1 Diabetic. And you've got high Blood Pressure too. Are you under a lot of stress? Not really, doctor. From now, try not to get stressed and focus on diet and exercise. If you leave this untreated... it will lead to kidney problems, heart attack, eye-sight problems, hearing loss and many complications. Don't take diabetes lightly. Your report will be ready soon. Wait outside. Thank you, doctor. Goodbye, doctor. Gunasekar Kolliappan, National Investigation Agency. I'm here to meet Maqbool, sir. He's a terrorist who will hang to death in an hour's time. You've been visiting with a court order for four months now. He hasn't talked all this time. Why would he talk at the end of the rope? I want to give it one last shot. Okay, go ahead. Sorry, Maqbool. I tried my best. I couldn't do anything about your death sentence. Couldn't...? ...or wouldn't? No, it's not that. I am just an Inspector with the NIA. I don't have the influence or power to stop an execution. Maqbool... they say that Abu Bakkar Abdullah had returned to India. What is his next move? Maqbool, please. Think about your family. I don't need the NIA or court to help your family. I can help them as an individual. Please, Maqbool. Talk to me. Who is Abu Bakkar Abdullah? Hey! Hiding behind a masked face and falsified voice... he has turned hundreds of people like you against the country... murdered innocent people to spread terror. He is a coward! Does standing up for his ideology make you a warrior? He is a brave Tamilian who will create a holy Caliphate here... and fly the flag of Islamic State. "A Man who loves Sarin... "a leader who commands an army of immortal underground warriors He is Abu Bakkar Abdullah!" What did you say? He's a Tamilian? He is a son of this soil – born and raised a Tamilian! Repeat what you said... in easy Tamil. Maqbool... please, tell me. I didn't understand what you said. I will take care of your family, Maqbool, please. Think of your son. Maqbool, please. Just tell me before you go, Maqbool. "In fervent anticipation of rebirth, Ravanan's 8 heads await their weddings." What does that mean? I don't understand, Maqbool. Aren't you supposed to be an intelligence officer? Figure it out. He's Abu Bakkar Abdullah! He won't be found so easily. Who the hell is he? Tell me! [NEWS] Abu Bakkar Abdullah, a prominent figure in global terror organization ISIS... has infiltrated into India according to reports received by Intelligence Agencies. Someone admitted on Facebook that your videos inspired them to do it. What's your answer to that? How could I have inspired them? My job is to teach the writings of the Holy Quran to the people. Some people interpret it wrongly and go down the wrong path. How am I responsible for it? We will plant bombs on the paths where infidels tread. Target their homes, their cities. Slaughter them. They shall not feel safe. Displace their families from their homes. Blow up their homes. It's time to form a pure state, a Caliphate. [NEWS] Are our cities safe? [NEWS] Who is this mysterious man hiding from the Intelligence for the past 6 years? We have a task force that's focused purely on finding Abu Bakkar Abdullah. Sir, it's been six years now. We haven't found him. Why? Are your Intelligence agencies failing us? Don't you think this has gone on for too long? Well, if our Intelligence agencies failed us... then... you wouldn't be sleeping peacefully at night. Right? "In fervent anticipation of rebirth, Ravanan's 8 heads await their weddings." What does that mean? Sorry, bro. Ravanan has 10 heads. Only 8 of them are getting wed, why? Doesn't add up. Brother... Brother, your tea. Brother! Hey! The first word means "rebirth". Ravanan gets reborn to marry eight times? Nobody in the office takes me seriously. If I take this to them, I'll be branded an idiot. What do I do? Take this, man. I am busy. Thanks, little brother. Why haven't you slept yet? Don't you have school tomorrow? It's midnight. Will you pay my school fees? Tell me, I'll go to school. You're irritating me at this hour yapping about school, Ravanan and Sri Lanka. -You have a point. -Just drink your tea. He keeps talking about school. How annoying! Sri Lanka! Hello. Let's meet. Evening. Okay. Not just Chennai City. We will turn the whole of South India into mass graves. Let's go to war, friends. A holy war. Our holy war will be the starting point in the making of a Caliphate in India. [NEWS] Who is the masked man? The country wonders! [NEWS] He has commanded his followers to take up arms... and engage in Holy War. He has called his followers to form a Caliphate... and wage holy war in South India. We will fight till this country and all its infidels are destroyed. Irfan Ahmed. - Second door on your left. - Okay. - Sir... - You're back! How was your interview? Let's not get into that. Do you not like to work here? Oh, no. It's not that. I want a job appropriate for my qualification. That's why I'm trying to become a chemical engineer. Looks like I'm just wasting my time. Look, you are over-qualified for the work you're doing here. I do agree. But this is a good job. Learn the trade. I'll teach you how to start a business. Why bother with these interviews? What do you say? I was going to ask you myself. I'm glad you brought it up. Let me just work here full-time. - Dad! - Hi, Karthik. How are you? - I'm great. - Did the deal go through? We landed a great deal, Dad. We'll be making first copies of Gucci, Armani, Dior, Prada's latest perfumes. It's a project worth a 100 crores. Qatar, Dubai, Abu Dhabi our products will be sold everywhere. Now it's all in your hands, Irfan. Did you send the list of required chemicals to Dr. Zazi? I e-mailed their team last week. Oh. And you both need to go to Coimbatore and meet Dr. Zazi. - Okay, sir. - Not just for the chemicals... I've also asked him for some funding. Irfan, maintain a good rapport with Dr. Zazi. It will help our business. Hey, where's that guy? Who? That duffer! Your boss! You mean Chida? To you, he is your lovely Chida! To me, he's Chidambaram. I've been calling him since last night. He hasn't answered my calls or returned them. He's gone to Kochi for the conference. Oh, he has? I must go to Kochi too. Book my tickets. Why? Who the hell are you? A junior must listen to the senior. Understand? - Who's the senior here? - You are, sir. - Show some respect. - Whatever you say. Book my tickets. Hey, Anisha. Looks like you ran from Chennai all the way to Kochi? - What's up? - Where is Chida? You just hopped on to a flight and came here? Didn't you call him? That guy is such a creep. He doesn't answer my calls. If I had your face, he'd have answered at the first ring. Only people like me can understand the pain caused by atrocities of such bosses! Chida Sir is not here. Where is he? The National Security Advisor Mr. Ajay Dewan has come from Delhi. Gentlemen, just listen to what this guy is saying. All the DGPs and Intelligence officers of the Southern states are here for it. You will not be able to meet Chida today. It's best that you e-mail him. Hey. We all know that the ISIS has been looking to mark their footing... across India for a while now. This video of Abu Bakkar talking about Chennai... and the rest of South India has to be taken seriously. And this video, is no mere threat. RAW and the IB have confirmed that an attack is imminent in Tamil Nadu. And it could be true, with the pro-ISIS sympathizers in Kerala... Coimbatore, and Hyderabad. But thanks to you guys... the Intelligence, and the State Police, we've managed to avoid any major attacks so far. Let's continue this good work. But this time, we have to talk out this man Abu Bakkar Abdullah. He is planning something really big. This is a matter of national security. And the Prime Minister is really interested to see-- Seeing a progress in us nabbing him-- Who is this guy? What does he want? Sir, one sec. You damned fool! Idiot, you are so fired. What are you doing? He's the National Security Advisor! Like a madman, you've called me 52 times since 2:00 am last night. Why? Don't keep calling me a madman to shut me up, sir. Don't shout, man. Just hear me out. We've had a big break in the Maqbool case. Hello, I'm Ajay Dewan. National Security Advisor to the Prime Minister. Shake his hand, man. Gu-- Gu-- Guna, sir. My dad's name is Kolli... I mean-- Kolliappan is my father's name. - But I am Gunasekar Kolliappan. - Alright. Chida said you had some... intelligence to share? Let go of his hand, you fool. I don't speak good English or Hindi. Only Tamil. You tell him. My father's home-town is near Madurai. I went to college in Trichy. Don't hesitate. - Sit down, and tell us. - Thank you, sir. "In fervent anticipation of rebirth, Ravanan's 8 heads await their weddings." That's what he told me. Sir, Mr. Kolliappan is new to Intelligence. He's acting like he's had a breakthrough in the case after hearing a silly riddle. Mr. Kolliappan, did you find an explanation for this code? "In fervent anticipation of rebirth, Ravanan's 8 heads await their weddings." Ravanan's head could mean Sri Lanka's capital, Colombo. In English, Awaiting resurrection could stand for… the holy Easter Day. So there could be an attack in 8 places in Colombo on Easter Day. But what's India got to do with what you're saying? Abu Bakkar Abdullah. Do you suspect anybody operating on behalf of Abu Bakkar here? Not yet, sir. Alright, everyone. Submit a report to the Sri Lankan Intelligence. We need to inform the Indian Embassy in Colombo as well. And there must be no news about this in India. Let's not incite public hysteria for no reason. Chida, make sure he has all the support he needs. - Manpower, finance... - Sure, sir. let him work on this. - Keep me updated on the progress. - Sure, sir. Find Abu Bakkar Abdullah. Who is he? Where is he? What does he look like? We know nothing. Abu Bakkar Abdullah is the most wanted man in India right now. Find him. That is your only priority. How was the interview, Irfan? You jinxed it. It was screwed up. You're all made up, Irfan. Looks like you attended another interview? It's not like you don't have makeup on. Hey, Irfan. Hey, Prarthana. What are you doing here? I came to meet your mother. I didn't go to work today. She's come to discuss an urgent matter regarding the case. - Here you go. - Thank you, ma'am. How was the interview? Not that question again! I'm talking to you. Tell me! It was whatever, Ammi. I did a good job with the interview, but... but they made up their minds that I'm unfit for the job. I didn't ask them for a reason. I let them keep their job and returned home. Why? You should have waited. I've wasted 3 years attending interviews. I joined Perumal full time. I'm going to be at a whole different level from now. You never know... I'm in India today, I could be traveling to the UK or US tomorrow. - I'm a businessman now. - Oh, sure. Tell me, man. Why didn't you come to the gym? Where are you? Home. I've called so many times since morning. Why didn't you answer? How was your interview? - Was it a flop show? - What do you want? Anyway, we were planning to go to Bangalore tonight. Come with us. I'm not coming to Bangalore. - Tell him, man. - Dude, I've got my UK visa. I'll be leaving in two weeks. Don't be a killjoy. It's just two days. - Come on. - No, man. You go ahead. You should go, son. Your friends are calling you. It will be a good break. Have you worked out Gunasekar's clue on Abu Bakkar Abdullah? Well, hurry up. Yes, it's important. I've reached Chennai. Guna, look at this. It's the complete social media analysis from the past year. Including reports from Android and Apple. We scanned Google, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Okay! We've blocked 105 official accounts that shared pro-ISIS posts. We've arrested five people for engaging in propaganda for ISIS. But I don't see any direct connection between them and Abu Bakkar Abdullah. What do we do? So we filtered the keywords "8 weddings", "Ravanan" & "resurrection". The world is about to explode, friends. He made a vlog about Ravanan's head burning. He didn't say anything clearly, but quite suspicious. Check him out. This uprising is crucial. Ravanan is going to marry in 8 different locations. I have a lot of details about these weddings. And if you wish to know those details... - Yes! - Is he crazy? Like, share, and no expletives in the comments! Hi, sir! - I'm a huge fan. - Fan? I've always wanted a picture with you. Really? Come on then. Let me. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Thank you so much, sir. I have such hot fans. - The donation you asked for. - Cheers. Sir, hamburger. - Don't eye the envelope! - Right, sir. Work hard, like me! Mr. Reporter, it feels too light. I'm sure it's the right amount. Okay. Let's talk. You released a vlog about Ravanan's head. Yes I did. Are you referring to terrorists? I don't know if they are terrorists. I have never seen them. But I do know that an ISIS group is active here in Tamil Nadu. How could you know that? Darling, I know too much. I wouldn't, and shouldn't talk about it. But I will do justice to the money I've been paid. So I will tell you this. This happened about a year ago. This group just got introduced then. I can't tell you more, darling. It's a business secret. What business was this? What kind of business secret? What was your role? Darling, I don't like the way you are questioning me. You've made me uncomfortable. Like a policeman. Vichu, tell him all about me. - Buzz off you dumb @^%@. - What did you say? Will you answer my question or should I get serious? Look, there's a thin line. On one side of the line, I'm a real nice guy. On the other side, I am really, really bad. It's time to choose whether I should be good or bad. You know who I am. Victor Darling, a journalist in green tunic harassing me... Can you just say hello to him? Talk to him. That's the Area Inspector, Victor Solomon. Didn't you threaten me? Talk to him. You fool. Inspector Victor Solomon, this is Gunasekar Kolliappan, NIA. under TADA Act. He spoke highly of your close friendship. I'll keep you posted on the investigation. You should be there. How about a selfie now, darling? No, sir... please. How dare you quote my mentor, you stupid Panda? What is this? Are you going to thrash me in the dark? They said you ran a black market business. - Business? - What is the nature of the business? How did you get their contact? Don't waste our time. Things are shrinking, damn it! John, bring the hammer. - Yes, ma'am. - Hammer? That's a gun! She asked for a hammer, and you handed her a gun, you idiot! What's your connection to them? Please don't bust my balls, sister. I'll tell you. I hacked a PSTN network for them. They paid me 20 Lakhs in cash. We hacked the network through the black web and set up a private network for them. They can send messages from anywhere in the world. A network exclusively for them. No SIM card required. All I did was create it for them. Can you access that network again? Only if they are active in the network. Once they are active... I can find out what they're up to. I'll update you in a few hours, sir. - Did the YouTuber talk? - He did. Dinesh, he's hacked the PSTN Network... and set up an exclusive telephone network for Abu Bakkar. - PSTN? - Yes. All the telephone networks in the world operate through the PSTN. It links fiber-optic cables, telephone lines, satellite links etc. It used to be an analogue system in the past. But now they've digitalised it. That's why people like Kumaran are able to hack into it. If the PSTN has been hacked... let's inform the Telecom Regulatory Authority. We have to inform the ministry. Hmm... No, Dinesh. Right now, only Abu Bakkar and us are aware that Kumaran hacked into this network It will be helpful for our investigation if this information doesn't go out. It is to our advantage if Abu Bakkar doesn't know that we know about this. Fine, what's our best option then? This guy. Kumaran. Let's hack into the network again using him. Let him use the same black web and hack into the network. Then we can track them down if they make calls or send messages. That's our best option. Trust me on this. [Radio] Good morning, Colombo. It's me, RJ Nikki from Red FM. What a beautiful sunny day! It's a very special day for our Christian friends. It's absolutely Holy Easter! A day to celebrate for all of us. Let's spread peace, love... and prayers for everyone on our beautiful island. Have a-- [explosion] [News] In a series of 8 bomb blasts in temples and star hotels in Sri Lanka... over 262 people have been killed. Simultaneous bombings were carried out in six places across Sri Lanka. Come. How was your trip? It was good, Ammi. The locations attacked include... St. Anthony's Shrine, St. Sebastian's Church, and Zion Church. The serial bomb blasts from day before yesterday... Take a shower and come. Let's eat. ...the Indian government had warned them of the imminent attacks. Our reporter Sathish Mani has more on this. Gentlemen... Sit down, please. Now that Sri Lanka is under attack... we need to increase surveillance in all ports of entry into India. Especially Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Railway stations, harbor, airports, bus stands on high alert. Any suspicious activity to be reported immediately. Okay? Now, any leads on who's behind this? I saw your TV sermons yesterday, dad. Very inspiring. What about your New York University admissions, Riyaz? I got in, Dad. I still have the visa interview. I need to go to Chennai for it. Good. I sent your brother Haider to study in the US too. But he turned out to be a big disappointment for me. Don't be like your brother. Study well to make our family, and our community proud. There is much work to be done. Yes, sir. ISIS has claimed the credit for these attacks. They've issued a warning that they'll be attacking India. But we've alerted our coastal guards, state police and STF teams. We are prepared, sir. Sir, the Sri Lankan attackers, including ring leader Mohammed Zahran, have visited Global Unity School in Coimbatore, according to a Facebook post. You mean Ahmed Zazi's Global Unity School? Yes, sir. As we dug deeper, we found out... an account transfer was made from Global Unity School Trust fund... to the mastermind behind Sri Lankan bombing, Mohamed Zahran. We could use that to arrest him and interrogate? No, we can't. Several charity donations are made from his trust funds, month after month. It's not his personal account. So we can't directly link him. Sir, Dr. Zazi does a lot of charity work. He has over 20 lakh online followers. His own TV channel. I'm sure you know he has over a 100 million viewers there. And he's also a preacher. Not a preacher, sir. You could call him a radicalist. He incites emotions by preaching salafism... and led many youngsters down the path of terrorism. He is not all innocent. If we watch him and his men, we may get some leads. What is it? We leave today, sir. We're going to Turkey tomorrow. And then cross the border to Syria. You've chosen God's path. Our brothers and sisters there need assistance. Help them. Don't worry about your families. I'll take care of them. We don't have any direct evidence against him, as you mentioned. He could be the man we're looking for. - Chida! - Yes, sir. Put Dr. Zazi under 24 hour surveillance. - Only temporary, right? - Okay, sir. There is a surveillance expert from Palakkad called Prakash Kurup. Bring him in. Follow everyone connected to Zazi. I need a full report on all of them within a week. Guna, Mr. Beard is inside. What? I meant our bearded man is inside. Thanks, Kurup. Can we go in? Be patient. We've just begun surveillance. There is no proof, Guna. We can't just barge in. Our job here is to watch, observe and gather evidence. He is a criminal only in your eyes. - Right? - Yeah. Trust me, he will get caught. Irfan, come here. Go to Coimbatore with Karthi this evening. Meet Dr.Zazi and complete the transaction. - Okay? - Okay, Sir. I just boarded the bus, sir. I'll reach Coimbatore by morning. I'll meet them by 10, sir. I'll call after the meeting, sir. Good night. - Hey! - Hey, Irfan. I swear I'm not following you. You seem to turn up wherever I go. You were at home the other day, now you're here. How come? Yes, I made up this lie that I'm traveling to Coimbatore... and had them book me on the same bus as you. I thought you said you would only be traveling to the US or UK? But they're only sending you to Coimbatore? Hello, I've got an important job in Coimbatore. I'll finish and head straight to Hyderabad. I've got a whole trip planned to Dubai and Sharjah in two days. I'm going to travel around the world real soon. Safe travels! This is Karthikeyan, my boss's only son. My junior boss. I'm just mooching off my father, come on! - Okay. - Nice to meet you, Karthik. See you! Is that your boyfriend? No way. My parents are pressurizing me to get married. They uploaded my profile on Tamil Matrimony. They've sent me profiles of boys to see. - Really? - Yeah. I want to see. None of these boys seem to be the right match for you. This guy seems okay. But he's settled abroad. So, no. I'm fine with someone from abroad. - Someone from US is definitely okay. - Really? - Yeah. - Super. Then say yes to him and happily settle down in the US. I was joking, Irfan. Did I work so hard and study law just to get married? I will only marry a boy from our city, if ever. Well said. So what takes you to Coimbatore? We've undertaken a huge project. We need funding for it. So there's an important meeting with a financier. All the best. Thanks. It's raining. Nice. - Have you eaten? - Tell me your love story. No, it's okay. I was just trying to pass the time. Karthi must be waiting for you. What should I tell you about? About Archana. Vivek told me about your famous love story. A love story between a Muslim boy and a Brahmin girl in IIT. It's an eight hour journey. If you're fine with it, I'm ready. It's common for a boy to go after the girl in love stories.

Sir, this is Irfan. He's the chemical engineer who handles all these things in the factory. - Hello, sir. - So you're the guy. Yes, sir. I saw the list of chemicals that you had sent. The chemicals have been delivered to the Irugur yard, and the rest to Hyderabad container yard. Karthik, you can mention my name and take the delivery. Sir, my father has asked me to go to Mumbai on work. Irfan will handle the deliveries. Sir, I'll handle it. Okay. Shall we go, Riyaz? Thank you, sir. Irfan, call up my father once the delivery is done. Okay, bro. I'll handle it. Yes, come. okay. As-Salaam-Alaikum, Ashraf. Wa-Alaikum-Salaam. - What brings you here? - There was a family event. So I took 2 days off to be here. I heard you were here, so I came to see you. Riyaz, this is Ashraf. He's the chief chemical engineer in our Chennai factory. A brilliant scientist! He could be so much more successful. But he quit his job in Dubai, wanting to live in his home-town. Okay, Ashraf. I'll see you in Chennai. - Sure, sir. - Khudha Hafiz. Kurup, we need to run a check on the people who were with Zazi. What were they talking about? Did you hear something? They discussed a chemical delivery in the Coimbatore and Hyderabad yards. The guy in green? He will be taking the delivery. He's here. A bald guy with a beard should be coming out now... ask Akash to find out who he is. Fine. You people track Zazi. I'll follow him. Okay, Guna. We'll be in touch. Cathy, go and enquire at the hotel. Go to Chennai, get all their details and update me. Sure. - Something is not right. - Yeah. Hey, call for our car. Right away. Yes? Dr. Zazi sent me. Oh, it's you? - Come, let's go. - Okay. Excuse me, sir. Cathy from NIA. Can you give us a few minutes, please? Sure. Does Dr. Zazi come here often? - How many people accompany him? - Around 10-15 people. - Can you get me the visitors book, please? - Yeah! Just check it, and we'll complete the formalities. Mariappan, open up! All of these are yours, sir. Can I get a copy of all of this? - Here. - Thank you. Cathy, I've left the container yard. I'm following him. - How much longer? - Another ten minutes. I think he is headed to the airport. Check the passenger manifest and book me on the same flight as him. I will. Cathy, he's headed to the Moosapet container yard. I'm on his tail. Brother, make a left. Cathy, he's left the Moosapet yard. Get the list of chemicals delivered to him in Coimbatore and Hyderabad. Yeah, I'm on it. If we find anything suspicious, we can arrest him and interrogate. Yes, right away. - Guna, where are you? - Charminar. I'm right behind him. Cathy, did you find anything on him? His name is Irfan Ahmed. He's from Triplicane. His mother is an SI. And Guna... he's an IIT gold medalist in chemical engineering. He couldn't land a job three years after graduation. So he's started working for Perumal just recently. But I couldn't find any dirt on him, Guna. He must have done something wrong, somewhere... just find it. Irfan, Karthikeyan, Riyaz... all three of them are clean. There are business deals between Dr. Zazi and Perumal. But no criminal record. Guna, if you ask me... Zazi is our prime suspect. Cathy, why should he take the delivery at Moosapet and come to Charminar? Something is not ri-- Hello? Hello, Kolli? Are you there? Are you there? What happened? - Tell me, Guna. - Sir, sorry. There's been a mistake. I lost him in the Charminar crowds. I need your help, sir. Okay, I'll send someone. [Islamic prayer call] Spice Jet announces that flight SJ 732 to Chennai is now ready for boarding. All passengers between rows 15-30 are requested to board the aircraft. - Hello? - Ammi, it's me. How did your work go? Was everything OK? Yes, it's done. I'm at the Hyderabad airport. I'm coming back. I didn't feel too good. So I went to the doctor. What happened, Ammi? What did the doctor say? Just come home. I'm on duty now. We'll talk in the morning. Mum, I'm at the security clearance. I'll call you back. Spice Jet requests all remaining passengers... on SJ 732 to Chennai board the aircraft. - Zoom in a bit. - Sir... Sir, my phone is missing. What? Sir, my phone is missing. It was right here. All remaining passengers on SJ732, please proceed to the gate immediately. Just wait a minute. Help me, sir. Please. - Sir, he lost his phone. - I'm getting late, sir. He can't speak Tamil, damn. Sir, I can identify the people in front of me. Please help me. - Sir, please. - [Hindi] Stand over there. Sir, why should I stand before the camera? Just security purpose. Go stand there. Spice Jet requests all remaining passengers... on SJ 732 to Chennai to proceed to the Gate 112. Go to the second floor. The airport police office is there. [Hindi] File a complaint there. Sir, airport police? [Hindi] Tell me, Chaubey. Sir, I just lost my phone. I was walking into the security check. - Sir, I'm getting late for my flight. - [Hindi] Wait outside for a few minutes. [Hindi] Okay... [Hindi] Yes, it's going great... Last and final call for Irfan Ahmed, Charumati Pandiyan, Prathap C Muthuraj... [Hindi] Sir, they're announcing my name. It's getting late. It's urgent. Okay. [Hindi] Just fill this form and wait outside. [Hindi] Go on. [Hindi] He's eating my brains. This is the last and final boarding call for passenger Irfan Ahmed... traveling on SpiceJet Flight SJ732 to Chennai. We request you to come to Gate 112 immediately. The gate is about to close. Sir, please let me go in. No, the gate is closed. Irfan Ahmed, we called you so many times. I'm sorry. I lost my phone. You can ask the police. - Please, ma'am. - The gate is closed. - Please, understand. - I'll talk to the officer. Sir, I have to take this flight. Sir, I lost my phone. You can ask the security. Why don't you tell him? - Show me the bag. - There's nothing in the bag. I have done the security check. I've already done the security check. I don't have anything in my bag. - Show me your bag. - It's not like I have a bomb in there! - Hello, Surya. - Hello, sir. Come. So, has he said anything? Did he mention Al-Qaeda or ISIS? No, sir. He claims it is an innocent mistake. Has the bomb threat assessment committee checked the flight? We've moved the flight to the isolation bay. Okay. We've checked thoroughly. I think it's good to go. What's his name again? Irfan Ahmed. Oh. Why am I not surprised? Come. Let's talk. Irfan Ahmed. Is this yours? Yes, sir. Why did you make a bomb threat? No, sir. This is a misunderstanding. I lost my temper. You make bomb threats every time you lose your temper? I was wrong. I shouldn't have said that. I am not a bad person. You checked my bag. You should know by now. It's a genuine mistake. Sorry, sir. We can't let you go when you apologise. This is very serious. IPC Sections 505, 506 and 507. You can go to jail for this for four years. Sir, please. I'm sorry. Talk to him. I was frustrated about losing my phone. Dinesh have you arrested one Irfan Ahmed? Yes, we have. - Let him go. - What? Why? He's a person of interest. We're surveilling him. We need eyes on him at all times. Are you religious, Mr. Irfan? Sir... What does that have to do with anything? Just answer my question. Are you religious or not? Yes. I am a proud Indian Muslim. It was a great offense to use the word "bomb" in an airport. Because of you, passengers, officials and airport staff... over 3,500 people have suffered today. I don't want to ruin your life. Surya, let's let him go. With a warning. You can go. Thank you, sir. - Sir, Sooraj here. - Where are you, Sooraj? I'm on my patrol rounds. I've sent you details on a suspect. He's boarded a flight from Hyderabad to Chennai. - After he lands, follow him. - Okay, sir. Get me everything on this guy. Sure, sir. I'll do that. Let the airport remain on high alert. Here we go. Check. Daddy, that's not fair. Why? I'll give you five minutes, right? - Okay. - Okay. Turn on the TV. In a breaking update, we have confirmed reports coming out of Hyderabad... that a huge bomb has exploded in the domestic airport parking lot... leaving many casualties. Is ISIS behind this terrorist attack? Has the terrorist who attacked Sri Lanka entered India? We are going live to the location with our correspondent... Prem, get everyone on the line. Now. Let it go, man. They only questioned you. They let you go. Don't over react. This is a small matter. A small matter? This is a small matter? No matter what I do, where I go, it all boils down to... the one question - "Are you religious?" Had you been in my place, would they have asked you that? No. Would they have eyed you with suspicion? No, they wouldn't. Why? Vivek Kumar and Irfan Ahmed deserve equal rights. Try sitting in the final stages of an interview. Or try being interrogated by a policeman like I was. He would see you with a completely different gaze. Just for one day... try living my life. Only then would you know my pain. Let me see you call it a small matter then. Lecturing me! Sorry, man. I'm sorry. Sooraj, where are you? I'm following the suspect, sir. There are two others with him. Sooraj, don't let him out of your line of sight. His house is in Triplicane. I've spoken to the city's police commissioner Ajith Kumar. He's with his team in Triplicane now. Okay, sir. If you see anything suspicious, you know what to do. The Special Task Force is on the way. Our team needs to cover the entire locality. Stay alert. Anisha, what's the update there? I'm here, sir. I'm going in. Be very careful. Don't cause any disturbance to the neighbours. Okay, sir. Everyone's asleep. There will be no disturbance. Okay, keep me posted. This way. - John, that way. - Okay, Anisha. Sir... The bomb blast in Hyderabad was triggered by a phone. Here are the details of the phone and its owner. Irfan Ahmed? Gentlemen, I'm going to cut to chase. Do we know who initiated the attack? Sir, it seems to have the trademark of ISIS. It is Abu Bakkar then! Looks like he kept his promise. Any solid leads? A chemical engineer from Chennai, Irfan Ahmed. He is associated with Zazi. A frustrated young man. It could be him. As you already know... he lost his phone in Hyderabad airport and made a bomb threat. This makes him a primary suspect. It could be a co-incidence. But we shouldn't take chances. You think he could be Abu Bakkar Abdullah? Sir, he fits the profile. The Hyderabad bomb blast was triggered through Irfan's phone. There's a good chance he is Abu Bakkar Abdullah. We need to arrest him. If we interrogate him, something big will come up. Okay, so where the heck is he now? He's on the way back from the airport. We don't have a lot of time. Look for anything suspicious, hurry up. He looks very upset, man. Okay, guys. See you tomorrow. I know I was a bit harsh. Sorry, guys. Sir. For now, he is only a suspect. Our orders were to follow him. Sooraj, my team will cover the entire perimeter. Shiva and team will provide you additional support. Yes, sir! - Shiva, split up and cover the area. - Sure, sir. Thank you, sir. Anisha... Yeah? He's come. Come out now. Copy that. How are you, my lady? - You're back? - Haven't gone to sleep yet? Guys, it's time. Okay, Anisha. - Anything interesting? - No. Okay, let's go. - Carry on, I'll come. - Come fast, Anisha. - Go to sleep. - Good night. If he is, in fact, Abu Bakkar Abdullah, let's go after him with full force. But catch him alive. There's been an attack on our soil. Abu Bakkar has done as he promised. Now it's our turn to retaliate. They are born and brought up here, make their livelihood on this soil… but they listen to some crazy lunatic and get radicalized. And then they think of destroying our country, and our people. We'll make an example out of this guy to all such people. When the world wakes up in a few hours, let's get them to watch. Within 15 minutes of his arrest, this news should reach far and wide. He should be trending in the whole world. Sure, sir. Kalai, get ready. Okay, sir. Let's show these people... that our nation won't just stand by and watch with folded hands. If he attempts to resist or even thinks of resisting... shoot him in public. Shoot to kill. Anisha, Irfan is the ISIS terrorist we were looking for. Irfan! Irfan Ahmed. Who are you? Under Terrorist and Disruptive Act... I place you under arrest for being an ISIS operative. Put your hands up. I said, put your hands up. Head down. - Head down! - Sir... I said, head down! Check mate! [Telugu] There was an explosion in a Omni van. [Telugu] We only know that TATP explosives were used. [Telugu] Ten people lost their lives. [Telugu] We still don't know how many are injured. [Telugu] We will have a press release shortly. [News] There was a bomb blast at the car park... of the Hyderabad international airport. Initial reports indicate a death toll of 10. The NIA and Special Task Force have arrested a suspect... named Irfan Ahmed from Triplicane, Chennai. He has been arrested on suspicion of being involved with the ISIS. Irfan Ahmed. I am Anisha Qureshi. These are the IMEI numbers of some mobile phones. The first number circled in this list... belongs to a phone recovered from the bomb blast site in Hyderabad. Your phone. How did your phone get to the bomb blast site? I lost my phone during security clearance at the Hyderabad Airport. I have nothing to do with this. You lost your phone at the Hyderabad Airport. But you didn't report to the police. And you made a bomb threat. A while later, there was a bomb blast at the car park of the same airport. That bomb was activated through your 'lost phone'. Do you want me to believe everything was one big coincidence? Please. Fine, then look at the delivery order of the chemicals... you procured from Hyderabad and Coimbatore. Everything is in order... but hydrogen peroxide in Coimbatore and acetone in Hyderabad... in large quantities! These have nothing to do with making perfumes, Irfan. These two chemicals mix to form TATP. Also known as mother of Satan! You had no clue, huh? This is the explosive regularly used by ISIS and Al-Qaeda. There is no way this happened without your knowledge. Please believe me. I know this makes me look guilty. But you are a Muslim too. So give me the benefit of the doubt. Don’t you dare bring the Muslim brotherhood into this! I'll kill you. It's because of people like you who do such things in the name of our God... [Radio] This is your RJ Sowmi, and you're listening to the Chennai Show. We're going to talk about the terrorist who has shaken up our nation. A few days ago... a terrorist organization released a video saying they'll attack several places in India. And as per their threat, they executed an attack at the Hyderabad airport. The investigation done by our intelligence agencies revealed the shocking truth... that a man named Irfan Ahmed from Chennai... was the mastermind behind this attack. It's being said that his mother is a police officer... and that he was born and raised in the Triplicane neighbourhood. To think that someone who looks like us, lives among us has been arrested for terrorism... is a little scary, right? I don't know who is to be trusted and who is not. Let's ask the public for their opinion. You pray five times a day. Are you religious? (This Movie is Encoded By themoviesboss) that doesn't mean I am a religious extremist! Do you know how to make bombs? What kind of a question is this, sir? - It's a very simple question. Do you know how to make bombs? My final year project at IIT was a bomb detection study. The project was funded by the UAE government. To avoid bomb attacks on their nation... we did a project about that. But that was 4 years ago. So you are used to making bombs? Am I right? Sir, 10 of my batch-mates worked with me on that. Would you arrest them too and interrogate them this way? Irfan, you haven't answered my question. Are you used to constructing bombs or not? I know sir! I know how to make a bomb. But that doesn't give you the right to brand me as a terrorist. Good! So, answer me... The bomb you planted in Hyderabad... is similar to the one that exploded in Sri Lanka. TATP. The ISIS mastermind who planned and executed both these attacks... it's you, right? Abu Bakkar Abdullah. No... No! You just dug up my life and picked out the parts convenient to frame me. Anybody could have such mistakes in their lives. I did order those chemicals. But that was part of my job. I did lose my mobile phone. But I don't know how it got to the bomb site. No terrorist would reveal his identity to the public. But you are a smart, educated terrorist. But your jihad is over. I own you now, brother. So, tell me the truth. Sir, this is the truth. Boys! Sir, it's a mistake. I haven't done anything. Sir, believe me. Please, sir. It's a mistake. I haven't done anything wrong. Sir, please. Sir, I haven't done anything wrong. When I hang you upside down and hit you on your spine... as the blood flows into your head, your brain will work better. Tell me, who is Abu Bakkar Abdullah? I don't know, sir. - What are your next plans? - I don't know, sir. - I have no plans, sir. - How many ISIS operatives work with you? No one, sir. Please believe me. - What are your next targets? - No targets, sir. Who is supporting you? Sir, please believe me. Think hard and give me a full confession. Spit out the entire truth. It is in the best interest of you and your dear ones. Sir, you have the wrong person. Please believe me. You have the wrong person. Help me! Help me!

But I will be here at the court tomorrow with my acid attacked face. For this very case. I am Irfan's lawyer! Were you able to hack into the network? The subtle act of chain snatching is an art. And the person who does that is an artist. Hacking is an art. What does that make me? Tell me! Just say it already. I am an artist. I hacked into the network half an hour ago. What the heck were you doing all this time? What did you find? Tell me. A total of 510 devices are registered in Tamil Nadu. But none of them are active. It will take a bit of time to hack into each of them. But we are close. We will know when they make a call or send a message. Good job! The audio surveillance is active, right? We went in and set it up this morning, posing as the EB maintenance. Okay, good. What time is your visa interview, Riyaz? Tomorrow, at 2:00 pm. Sit. Your time here is up. It's my responsibility to ensure you have good education and a good life. US is a good option. I will move to Malaysia after you leave. Why do you have to go to Malaysia, Dad? They have started digging into all our businesses here. I've set everything up in Malaysia. We have their government's support too. Riyaz, you do one thing ... Hello? Hello? What happened, Dad? You look tense. If that boy Irfan spills the beans when they torture them... all our hard work will go to waste. A storm might shake you. But as long as you are not shaken, your goal cannot be obstructed. You taught us this. Don't worry, Dad. Allah is with us. Don't worry. I will handle it. - Good night, Dad. - Sleep well my son. Sir, there is another incoming call. Connect to it. - I'm unable to track this. - What do you mean? There is an incoming signal, but I can't track the network. Hello? You switch off the phone. Excuse me. You are Anisha Qureshi, right? We called you several times. We've been waiting here for 5 hours! When can we meet Irfan? Who are you? His lover? Or his lawyer? Whoever you are, you can't meet him. How can we believe you haven't beaten him up and injured him? We hit him. We kicked him. We stomped on him. What can you do about it? Please… Just tell me when I can see my son. Madam, please! He committed an act of treason. He killed a lot of people. We can't give him visiting privileges and treat him like a VIP. This is not a hotel. I'm sorry. How dare you! How dare me? Do one thing. Get a court order allowing you to see him. Then I'll tell you where we've held him and when you can see him. I have no sympathies for a terrorist. Sorry. Please leave now. Oh no. Ma'am? Ammi... Ammi... Please... Please, she wouldn't have taken her pills. Say something. Which hospital? I need to see her, please. Please. You can't see her. But if you cooperate with us, we will get her the best treatment. She is currently seated at the waiting area of the Government Hospital. She's been waiting for 2 hours now. Our people are with her. If we choose to, she'd still be waiting for another 2 hours. If she doesn't get her treatment... Please? Please... What I say might sound wrong to you... but what your mother is going through now... because of your fault is what is actually wrong. Your own community has asked her to vacate the house... because they don't want to support a terrorist. Indefinite suspension from work. All the friends you've made over the years, neighbours, and now the media too... all of them consider her a terrorist. Only you can save her now. I'll give you 10 minutes. Who are you? How many others are with you? What are your plans? I need a full confession. Don't do it for us. Or the country. Do it for your mother! Think it through. But I don't think she has much time. So... tick-tock. It is me! I am Abu Bakkar Abdullah! I helped the Sri Lankan bombers. I planted the bomb in Hyderabad. I have plans to carry out multiple bomb attacks in Chennai. Yusuf Shami, Mohammed Pathan, Zaheer Kirmani and Syed Khan. These four guys from Coimbatore worked with me. The terrorist you are looking for, the ISIS mastermind, Abu Bakkar Abdullah... is me! Sir! - Yes, Dinesh?- Sir, it's done. Irfan has confessed. Good, record a full confession in the presence of a magistrate. Sure, sir. See if you can arrange for a hearing this night. I will notify the Chief Justice. - Sure. And Dinesh, make sure you clean him up before you present him. Sir! Wound dressings, clean clothes etc. And Dinesh... the details of the vehicle you use to transport him, and the travel route... keep it confidential. - Only very few of us should know. - Sure, sir. And let's not use the local police for escort. Use some officers from the STF and the NIA. And Dinesh, keep this as low profile and quiet as possible. Sir, things are safe here. There are six of us. We've taken the side roads. Everything is in control, sir. - Careful, Sooraj. - I'll take care. - Keep me posted. - Thank you, sir. Yes, dear? Do you have to bring this up now? I am busy at the moment. Here. You don't want it? Don't create drama in front of the judge that you were denied food and water. Don't you get it? I'm driving, Usha. I'll be another two hours, at least. I can't tell you where I am. Don't ask unnecessary questions. I don't have the time to hear your grumbles. Do what you can. Right. I didn't say you were right. You are always wrong. - Fine, stop it. - Sir, I hear some noise from the back. Just shut up and drive. Go straight. Stop the vehicle! Stop! Don't do anything foolish. Drop the gun. Drop the gun. I don't give a damn if she lives or not. - Drop the gun. - Don't... Listen to me. Don't do it. I won't say it again. Drop the gun! - Hello, Dinesh. - Yes, sir? We've got the official shoot at sight order. It's been faxed to all the local stations too. Okay, sir. We've issued a red alert for the whole of Chennai. We've sent word on social media, TV news and newspapers... that the public must report anyone suspicious to police emergency. We've admitted his mother at the Government Hospital, right? He will definitely go there to see her. This is Abu Bakkar Abdullah! If we fail to catch him today... not just Tamil Nadu, several places across India will turn into graveyards. We have to put an end to Irfan tonight. Hey, Anisha. Are you okay? Yeah, feeling better now. - Visitors book. - Yes, ma'am. How many of us are here now? Twenty people around the hospital. I've posted three men outside the ICU. All are armed... Where are we holding her? The third floor. I've moved out the other patients. She is the only one there. We are missing something, Guna. What do you mean? Someone helped him, Guna. He couldn't have escaped otherwise. Tell our men to remain alert. I'll go check every floor. Okay. - Prarthana... - Irfan! Listen to me quietly. There is a medical supplies room at the end of the corridor. Go there in a couple of minutes. I'll see you there. What are you trying to do, Irfan? I'll explain everything. Just trust me on this. Go! Irfan, what is this?! What have you done? Come with me. They've framed me. Believe me. How can I believe you? They've got a lot of proof against you. Have a look at this. Someone sent this to my phone. You have a lot of explaining to do. There is an explanation for everything. But now is not the time for that. Listen to me. Trust the judiciary and surrender. Surrender?! Who should I trust? Should I trust your law that allowed them to hold me and torture me for 29 days... on the basis of fabricated evidence and mere suspicion? Or should I trust the police officers who beat me black and blue? They didn't bother to find out the truth about me, and branded me a terrorist. I don't trust the police or your justice system. No one cares about the truth. Only I can save myself. And I'd do anything for that. I don't have an option. Irfan, this is dangerous. I'll help you, come what may. I'll collect the evidence. Before you collect the evidence and present it to them... I'll die a terrorist for no crime of mine. I'd rather die after committing the crime they accuse me of. That's the anger talking, Irfan. That's not the man I know. - I need to see my mother. - No way, Irfan. The police have surrounded the hospital. There are three men with guns outside the ICU. If they were to even see you... Your mother's condition is critical. You will make things worse. If she doesn't get the right treatment, she won't make it. Please understand. Give this phone to her. I'll call her. Please do this for me. Think before you act. Right now, you are only accused of being a terrorist. Don't give them reasons to confirm the accusation. And then we'd never be able to set things right. Goodbye, Prarthana! Vivek, can you get me something to eat from the canteen? - Yeah, sure. - Thanks. Hello? Ammi... Are you doing well? How are you? I am ready to go back to work this very moment. Then get ready, woman! I will pick you up. There are two men standing outside with guns. Shall we take them along for company? Ammi... You will be fine. Promise me you will be safe. Ammi... All the things they say about me... The whole world may turn against you... But I know who you are. I believe in you. Remember that. Never forget that. Ammi! You need the doctor... Call for the doctor. I wish to see you one last time. I'm coming. May Allah bless you my child Fai-- Mom! My mother... Sir, please sir. It's my mother. Sir, I want to see my mother. Sir, please. It's my mother. Please, sir. Sir, please let me see my mother. Sir, please sir. It's my mother... ♪ For the first time since I left the womb ♪ ♪ I'm enveloped in utter darkness ♪ ♪ The womb that gave me breath of life ♪ ♪ I've lost it forever now ♪ Irfan, put your hands up. Don't move or I'll shoot. - Vivek?- Prarthana, come down. - Where are you?- At the car park. Irfan is in the hospital. The police are firing at him. Come down immediately. Copy that. We are behind him. Sooraj, he is at the flyover opposite Central Station. - Block him right now. - I'm on Pallavan Road. I'll get him. Damn it! The whole world may turn against you... but I know who you are. I wish to see you one last time. All the evidence stacked against him... is around Sri Lankan bombing and Hyderabad bombing. You said he was with you in Bangalore during the Sri Lankan bombing? Well... he didn't come to Bangalore with us. He said he was going to Delhi to meet Archana. He told us to lie about it too. If we can prove Irfan was in Delhi with Archana... that would really help the case. Give me Archana's number. I don't have Archana's number. What? We know Archana only through Irfan. He said she is a very private person. I don't think anyone in our group has her number. What do we do now? I need to talk to her! IIT We can get her number from the students record. I know someone from Admin over there. Let's ask him. He will definitely help us. Fine, call him immediately. Please. Now! You shoot me, and what next? The police have surrounded the area. Come with me if you wish to escape. He escaped, right? Sir, we've combed the entire area. No sight of him yet. Fine, inform the local police and setup road blocks. We need to check all the areas around Chennai Central. - Any other updates? - No sir. Nothing yet. And the four names he revealed during his confession... Syed Khan, Zaheer Kirmani, Yusuf Shami, Mohammed Pathan. There is no one in Coimbatore by any of those names. Their real names are... Zaheer Khan, Syed Kirmani, Mohammed Shami, Yusuf Pathan. Yep, all of them are Indian cricketers. He tricked us! And, Dr. Zazi is in Chennai. He is at his house in Egmore. We have him on surveillance anyway. See if you can find something through Kumaran. And meet me at the office in 30. Okay, sir. He proved that he can sell any Muslim name as a terrorist, and we'd buy it too. And we were convinced that we nabbed the terrorist! What is this world coming to? My God! Guna, stop the car. - Why? - Stop the car. I'll tell you. - What happened? - Go to office and push Kumaran. Let me know if some communication opens up in that network. I'll get off here. Anisha, where are you going? Dr. Zazi is in Chennai. Irfan escaped from us the day Zazi landed here. It can't be a coincidence! I'm going to check this. I'll call you. You go now. Okay. My past, my education, my life and my one and only dearest mother... I've lost it all. No one is born a terrorist! Riyaz, this is how terrorists are created! If a man's life can be destroyed on the basis of suspicion... they should fear that someday, someone would strike back! I am going to create that fear among those who rule this country. I'll freaking show them what I am capable of. Abdul, take the car to the garage. What are we doing here, Riyaz? Who are these people? Riyaz, in the last 5 days when the world branded me a terrorist... you didn't come to my help. Now that you have so many men with you... why have you come for me now? What do you want from me, Riyaz? Be honest! There is a reason you are here now, Irfan. Ashraf, our chemical expert... he was synthesizing a dangerous chemical for this mission, sarin nerve gas! Two days ago, the poor guy died due to a cardiac arrest. But our mission shouldn't come to a halt because of that, right? You should complete synthesizing the sarin gas. Come. You said you wanted to induce fear among this nation's rulers, right? You won't find a better opportunity. Show them what you are capable of, Irfan. So you are Abu Bakkar Abdullah? First tell me one thing. Are you ready to do this? Are you ready to fight by our side? Riyaz... the moment I got in your car, it was destined that I belong here. What should I do? I am ready. "A Man who loves Sarin... "a leader who commands an army of immortal underground warriors. Abu Bakkar Abdullah!" Sounds like a catchphrase. Yes, Cathy. Maqbool said that. That's what I thought when I heard it too. Why would a catchphrase be a man's dying words? Here you go! "A Man who loves Sarin... "a leader who commands an army of immortal underground warriors. Abu Bakkar Abdullah." My God! Nerve agent! Sarin! Ambattur chemical factory. That's the location. Chemical factory... I got the phone signal. I saw it... They are there! Right there. It's time. Riyaz? Hey! - What are you doing here?! - Dad... Riyaz, I tried calling you several times! Why is your phone switched off? Who are those men outside? And this boy... what is he doing in our factory? We must immediately inform the police. Let’s begin!

Dr. Zazi too owns a factory there. A chemical factory. That's where we got the phone signal from. Sir, it makes sense. Maqbool's clue, chemical factory, sarin gas. But we don't know if Abu Bakkar Abdullah is there yet? Yes, sir. And if we send our force over to the factory... they might release the nerve gas, right? Don't send any police force to the factory. Just vacate the public from the factory's vicinity. Enforce a curfew in the other areas. No public movement. Okay, sir. We'll need air support in this. I need to get to the Prime Minister. It's time.

I thought that explained his hesitation to talk. But there is no Archana. Do you still not get it? He is a freaking liar and a terrorist! You've done good work, Irfan. What should I do next? Be patient. You have a surprise. Ali... Test it. Before we release the sarin gas publicly... we need to test the gas you prepared. You have no idea what you are going to do, Riyaz. This is a great sin! I'll give you one last chance. Side with us. We need a public figure like you. You fool! You are doing exactly what the Quran forbids us. Why are you doing this? You preach to the whole world, Dad. And I grew up on your preachings. Don't blame me now. Before the world gets to know that my son is the terrorist they are searching for... I'd rather die, Riyaz. People like you are not true Muslims! There is no place for you in Jannatul Firdaus. Rot in hell! Take him. Greetings, sir. Sir! [Hindi] Sarin gas is a deadly chemical, sir. Sir, may I? This is a man-made chemical weapon. It's a colorless, odorless liquid. When it is vaporized and inhaled... or when it is exposed to its liquid form, death can be within 10 minutes. [Hindi] These terrorists use bombs to kill people. - So why are they using gas now? - Sir... During 1988, in Iraq, 3200 people died due to sarin. Over 10,000 people suffered internal injuries. In Tokyo, during 1995, 15 people died. And 5,500 people suffered internal injuries. Even recently in Syria, their own government released sarin gas... about 1700 people died, including children and the elderly. And 3,500 people suffered internal injuries. Sir, this is a hundred times more brutal than death by a regular bomb. It's a nerve gas that makes people suffer a painful death through inhalation. It paralyzes all the muscles around the lungs. Body liquids start to come out. It's a slow, painful, and brutal death. Not just one person. Thousands of people who inhale this gas will suffer death simultaneously. Any person who creates this gas, or wants to create this gas... he is no human! Good job, Irfan. Welcome to ISIS! [Hindi] If this sarin gas is in the air for 20 minutes... how many people would die? - I mean, approximately... - 50,000 people, sir. Fifty thousand... But it will also go down as the single worst act of terrorism... the world has ever seen. Sir, as we sit, talk, discuss... the attack could be happening any minute. I followed Zazi here. Something is going on, Guna. Talk to Chida and send over a force immediately. Anisha, we still don't know if Abu Bakkar Abdullah is there. They've ordered a total curfew in the area surrounding the factory. Get out of there now! Anisha, it is not a bomb blast like we thought it would be. It's a chemical attack! Sarin nerve gas. So, no one is coming? I can't just stand outside and watch this, Guna. Anisha, everything will be done in 30 minutes. How can we be certain they won't release the gas before the force arrives? Countless lives will be lost. I am going in. Anisha, why are you doing this? Because he didn't escape from Gunasekar Kolliappan. He escaped from Anisha Qureshi! [Hindi] Okay, what do you suggest we do? Bomb the factory, sir. The only way to render the gas ineffective is to expose it to high temperature. Bomb the factory, destroy it from its source. [Hindi] But how? Using an unmanned MQ-9 Reaper drone with missile capabilities! We have this drone fully loaded... flying over the Bay of Bengal right now, undertaking surveillance. We can use this drone to strike the target with considerable accuracy. It can reach Chennai in about 30 minutes. Of course, if you agree. [Hindi] Talk to the Chief Minister. [Hindi] Enforce Section 144 across the city. Chief, you have my permission. [Hindi] Bomb the factory. This gas shouldn't be released. Come what may! Yes, sir. Hey! Guna, I've spotted him! Abu Bakkar Abdullah is right here. Anisha, wait. Abu Bakkar Abdullah? If we stop Abu Bakkar Abdullah, we stop the attack. Inform Chida to send-- Anisha? Anisha! Answer me, damn it! Brother... Catching Abu Bakkar Abdullah is no easy task. But you did a good job. You were careless, Riyaz. She got close. Sorry, brother. This means that the police suspect something. Toss her aside somewhere. - Okay, brother. - Irfan... Guna... I can't hear you. What did you just say? It's not Irfan. ABA... Anisha... Can you hear me? What happened? Can you hear me? Anisha? Anisha! Irfan, father often said you were a man of virtue. And you proved that today. Good job, Irfan. What are you looking at? Perhaps wondering how someone by the name Karthikeyan... is standing in front of you as Abu Bakkar Abdullah? There is no big story behind my conversion. My mother died when I was 12. I was heartbroken. My father sent me to Syria with my relatives. It was so hard to live as a Hindu there. While I was struggling, I realised that the one true God was Allah and the one true religion is Islam. That was when my friend Haider Salaluddin introduced me to ISIS. And that's when I got introduced to the leader of ISIS, Abu Bakkar Al-Baghdadi! Three days Irfan! In just three days, He turned my life around. That was how I got converted from Karthikeyan to Abu Bakkar Abdullah. I planned and executed several small attacks in India from 2013. To wipe out the infidels and establish a caliphate... terror and terrorism were necessary. And for that, I needed an army. So I hid my face and slowly assembled a team in India over the last eight years. I executed small attacks. I planned the Sri Lankan attacks and helped them execute it. Anybody who stood for ISIS, I stood by them anonymously. Ashraf and Riyaz joined me later. We planned a chemical attack that would catch the world's attention. Over the past year, we ordered the required chemicals in small batches. To execute my plan, all I required was the name 'Karthikeyan'. To date, no one suspected or questioned Karthikeyan. Because they were not looking for Karthikeyan, the Hindu. Instead, they were looking for Abu Bakkar Abdullah, the Muslim! You think it's cowardice? The most enduring of wars have not been won by brawn, but with brain! Come. Sir! [In Hindi] Ajay, one minute. - Sir? - Please sit. Ajay, I have played many games of chess with you. And every time I thought I had you cornered on a chess board... you always had a Plan B. You never lost a game. But then, that was just a game of chess. And this isn't. The God that you and I pray to, has brought you to me at the right time. But it's time for you to go now, brother. Irfan, every one of us has a purpose in life. And once we fulfill our purpose... our time is up. The purpose of your life was to make this sarin gas. And you've done that successfully. So thank you, Irfan. If you want me to believe that you don't have another game plan here... I must have misread the intelligence of the smartest man I have known. ♪ Everyone wondered who he was ♪ ♪ His foes tremble ♪ ♪ Now that they know who he is ♪ ♪ The battlefield, his play field ♪ ♪ Splattered with blood ♪ ♪ His hunt begins ♪ ♪ With fire in his gaze ♪ You are right. The same god that we pray to, has put you in front of me! An eight year long penance! Sir, we are ready. Sir... [Hindi] Ajay, you haven't answered me yet. This time there is no other master-stroke. Just a missile! Good luck. All set? Sir, we've notified all factories within a 2 km radius. The evacuation is underway. - Fire service, ambulance... - We have everything on standby, sir. Shoot him down. Don't allow him near me. Riyaz, we've been fooled. Irfan is an officer who is here to stop our mission. Brother, I'm coming over. Listen to me. I'm releasing the gas immediately through the factory chimney. Send the cylinders to densely populated public spaces around the city. Let the world watch these infidels burn to death. We must release this sarin gas all over Chennai tonight. This is our moment, understand? All our years of struggle boils down to this. Don't worry about our lives. Heaven awaits us, brother. The cleansing begins now! Isn't this what you came for? Come and pick it up. We have another 10 minutes. Please don't hasten or panic. Get into the buses. Come at me! You went around inciting a war. I dare you to stand up! You bloody coward! Die! Anisha? Hey! Are you okay? The gas has been released, Irfan. We have to get out now. We can't stop it. No, take the laptop. It has the details of his entire network. Get this to Ajay sir. Stop their network! You go! Go now. What are you going to do now? On the main chimney, there is a control box at 20ft height. Someone has to climb up the chimney and manually turn off the switch. What? There is a missile coming at us. So they will destroy this factory and save the people. Please come with me now. "Whosoever killed a person... it shall be as if he had killed all of mankind." "Whosoever saved a life... it shall be as if he saved the whole of humanity." This is what my Quran taught me. I don't care about my life. I have to go. Go! You should leave. Sir, I am outside the factory. Everything is going as per your plan. But the gas has been released. It will descend to ground level in 10 minutes. If we don't stop it in time, we will lose several lives. Okay. He did it, sir. Mission accomplished! Okay. Ajay! The world around me rejoices in joy... convinced that Irfan Ahmed was the terrorist Abu Bakkar Abdullah... that we managed to kill. But who is this Irfan Ahmed? Why did he go into that factory today? The world will never get to know about this mission. [Hindi] What was his real name? Irfan Ahmed or Abu Bakkar Abdullah? [Hindi] Well, never mind. It doesn't matter anyway. [Hindi] A terrorist is just a terrorist! Good job. Thank you, sir. Rather than calling it a mission... you could call it the sacrifice of a Muslim boy and his mother for the nation. A sacrifice made to trace out Abu Bakkar Abdullah and his ISIS network. We were struggling to find Abu Bakkar. To find him, I played their own game against them. Staying invisible! Are you Irfan Ahmed? Yes. A top intelligence mission known only to a very few trust worthy people. Are you a chemical engineer? Yes. Are you in love with Archana Krishnamoorthy? Yes. A military intelligence team hand-picked by me. A team of well trained officers from all over the country. To find an intelligent terrorist... I found someone who was more intelligent than him. A chemical engineer. And I named him Irfan Ahmed. Erasing his real name and existing life… lying about everything to everyone around him… and risking his life for the mission... was a proud Indian Muslim! We knew about the business connections between Dr. Zazi and Perumal... and that is why Irfan worked for Perumal. Let's meet. These are the ISIS operatives who are going to carry out the attacks. - How long do we have? - Hardly two days. There are going to be multiple blasts across Colombo on the day of Easter. What shall we do? We got to know about the planned attacks in Sri Lanka... and Abu Bakkar Abdullah's involvement in it. We thought he'd definitely come there to help carry out the attacks. Though we warned the Sri Lankan Intelligence about the attacks... - I don't see anyone.-...they couldn't avert it. I think he isn't here. But we managed to stop them in India. Based on Irfan's information, we got to know that... the Chief Engineer of Zazi's factory, Ashraf, was ordering restricted chemicals. We suspected that they were planning a chemical attack. We created a situation where they'd urgently need a chemical engineer. Ashraf, Zazi's chemical expert. Ph.D in chemical engineering! Take him out! Okay? Hyderabad was the first step... in making the world believe that he was a terrorist. We are going to make the world believe you are Abu Bakkar Abdullah, okay? Let's get this done. A controlled blast at Hyderabad airport. We passed off 10 unclaimed corpses as victims... and turned the world's attention towards Irfan... and made them believe he was an ISIS terrorist. If we plant a man named Irfan Ahmed under suspicious circumstances... I said, put your hands up. how would this world perceive him? - Terrorist! - Terrorist Irfan Ahmed... ISIS operative. The media lapped up our false story and branded him a terrorist. At the same time, we eliminated Ashraf and kept the doors open for Irfan. You can't see anything from the CCTV. It will look like a cardiac arrest. Before the body goes for an autopsy, the drug will be completely dissolved. I'll let you know about the rescue mission. Stay out of sight until then. As per our plan, we executed his escape. Your mother is on the third floor. Everything went as per our plan. Your mother is very critical. We can call this off right now. Just say the word. No, sir. My mother will be fine. We've waited so long. She wouldn't want me to abort this mission for her at this point. Even in her death, she stood by her son. And in her death, her son stood by his country. Being an Indian is an emotion. Name, faith, caste, religion... how could these alone make one a true Indian? Beyond religious beliefs, today, a man sacrificed his life for his country. and saved our lives. And that man was an Indian Muslim! And for that, I am proud of him! A silent warrior. His is a story of hope, faith, and belief. And that makes him a king of this land! But terrorism doesn't stop there. No matter how many more Abu Bakkar Abdullahs come before us as a threat... without seeking the glory of medals, promotions, or recognition... another Irfan Ahmed will stand in front of them as our protector!
