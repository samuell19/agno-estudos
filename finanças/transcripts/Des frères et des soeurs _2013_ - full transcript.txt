- Want some? - No, no. Just one. I'm on a diet. Why? You're not overweight. That's because I diet. It's Dad's 70th. We've planned nothing. I thought maybe some sheepskin slippers. I thought we could give him a real surprise. Let's go to La Rochelle on Friday. Antoine can pick us up, we'll spend a weekend with Dad and come back on Sunday. Nice for the kids. Just the brothers and sisters. No kids or anything. I'm not sure about Jéréme. - I can call him. - I'll take care of it. Damn! - And the others? - Antoine likes it. And Amaud? Not after last Christmas. He called me a champagne socialist. He doesn't know what that means. Birthdays mean nothing to him. He never buys presents. He would, if he had the money. Then he should work. He's never paid taxes. He's not even registered. And you always take his side. You have to learn to criticize. - OK? - Hi. So where's Amaud? Are you crazy? If he ﬁnds out he wasn't invited, he'll go crazy. - Is that what you want? - See? How will he ﬁnd out? Careful. Either we call him, or I'm not going. What'|| you say to him? Well... We organized it yesterday. You thought Alice was telling him. She didn't do it. That should work. No. It'd be better to say Alice was supposed to call. You'll give me an earful. And it wasn't my fault. I won't. it's just a story. I'll just say we're celebrating Dad's birthday and forget the details. - OK. - Answerphone. - Please leave a message. Hi. It's Antoine. Can you call me? It's urgent. See you. OK. Brothers and Sisters Careful! Oh no! Lucky you saw it. What's a black cat worth? - It's really bad. - Meaning? Worse than an open umbrella inside. There's no proof. Are you kidding? Aunt Agatha saw one. 2 days later, she had cancer. Black cats are terrible. We braked in time. He crossed our path. We can't go on. We have to. We can't sleep here. It's bad luck for the ﬁrst person to pass. So we wait for someone else to go by. Is my cough raspiﬂg? I wouldn't say that. - You're a doctor. - Don't start, Alice. I've had noses and glottises all week. It's the weekend. Nice. Don't complain if I cough up a lung. I promise. - Is that a bike? - That counts. Wait for him to go by. - It's an old guy. - So? Not an old guy. They've got nothing to lose. Is that Dad? Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! - Dad! - Call an ambulance. - Dad! - Call an ambulance! Oh my God! That Way! Dear God, give me network coverage... Dear God, don't let him die... Come on, Dad. Please. Come on! Damn it! Come on, Dad. What? Wait. 1, 2, 3. Come on, girls. Help me. Yes. It's Amaud. - What should I say? - Don't answer. Quiet. Hello? Hello. All right? Yes I called. You see... Because... Dad had a problem. A heart problem. We're not sure. Yes. It'd be good if you came. They're in the train. Take the 5 o'clock. I'll pick you up. OK? See you later. Why didn't you say? On the phone? Do you want to do it? - What'|| we tell him? - Err... Antoine came and found him in the kitchen. - So I have to lie. - We're all going to lie, Antoine. I knew this birthday idea was a bad one. What do you mean? You don't do surprises for a man with a heart condition. You should have said he had a heart problem. I feel guilty too. It's not just you. Come on... Calm down. We need to keep it together. Tell us when we can cry, then. We left his scooter in the ﬁeld. I'll get it. Then we'll call the doctor. Let's change his trousers. Take them off. - Just me? - I'll be right there. What? - He's got no pants. - What? He's got no pants on. - Here. - No. I can't do it. You can't leave his arse out. OK. Come on. Just don't look. Come on. 1,2,3. - Hello, doctor. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. I don't know. Monday or Tuesday. We'll do it tomorrow. I'd prefer you didn't come now. We've got so much to organize... It'd be better if you just came for the funeral. If I've got the 3 kids on top of everything else here... It's not just what my sister said. OK. Bye. - Bye. - Goodbye, doctor. Thanks. Let's go. We're late. OK? Hello. What is it? Where did you ﬁnd him? In the house. Where exactly? In the kitchen. Poor Dad. You must have been shocked. Is he in his room? Shall I come with you? You can see he lived alone. He ate complete rubbish. Is that good? Didn't the doctor want an autopsy? No. Why? I think he was attacked. Look at his neck and hands. They're scratched! It was the branches, when he fell. He fell? We think so, because his scooter's smashed. The doctor said he must have fallen off, come back home and had a heart attack. Maybe someone knocked him down to rob him. No. The doctor would have seen. - Come one. - Are you sure? Yes. They know what they're doing. Come on. Yes. I'd rather not. Tell Colette to cancel my Monday and Tuesday appointments. Yes, Tuesday too. Yes? - Can I sleep with you? - Yes. Dom, I've got to go. OK. Bye. I love you too. It's strange not to hear Dad snoring. Normally, I can hear him. It bothers me, now I can't. We'll probably miss his snoring the most. - Was that your girlfriend? - Yes. - I don't to talk about it, Alice. - OK. What's all that? My medication. You need a bag like that for 2 days? You've got to have them when you need them. I think I forgot my sleeping tablets. What do you mean? Do you take a lot? Like all mothers, Antoine. What with stomach-aches, earaches... When you've got 3 snotty kids, we'll talk. There it is! You know that's what Mum took. It's all right. Forget about it. - Hey! - What? It's weird? Yes. It's weird. Hello? It's Dad. I left your sister a message... with the time difference, you must be in class. But... I've got something important to tell you. Call me back? Love you. All right! I didn't sleep a wink. Me neither. Did you notice, his face is changing? No. It is. The expression has changed. His nose is sinking. Like Georgette's. Like a bird's beak. Is that like Georgette's? You know... a bit pointed. Like a blackbird or something. There's a smell. - No. - There is. When you... Just a trace... It smells of something. I don't smell it. No, Adéle! What are you doing? Can you smell something? - No. - On that side. I'll open the window. - No, don't. - Why? - We need some air. - No. No! Are you a doctor? Do you know about bacteria? The air mustn't circulate. I'm going out. Oh. Adéle! What? I'm ready when you are. Where are you going? Church, town hall, funeral parlour. Corning? No. That's depressing. I'll stay with Dad. OK? And don't open Dad's window. Why not? Just don't open it. Nothing too religious. - Meaning? - Nothing too heavy. You know: "Jesus, Mary, it's all my fault." It's hard not to mention Jesus in a mass. He's our Dad. It's our choice. We can do a medley of songs about death. Nice. We have got things to do, if you don't mind. No problem. Poor Mum. Poor Mum. Poor Mum. Poor Mum. The Santellis. Poor Mum. Hello. Can we see the priest? About what? - A burial. - I'll get him. Will you wait? To Mum Amaud Adéle Antoine Alice Amélie Santelli born Chéteau 1945 - 1985 Antoine July 1999 Amaud October 2012 - So? - Monday. 2 o'clock. Look. We got... that, but with off-white inside. That's really horrible. There wasn't much choice. This is the country. There's some food you can't get. Is that all in? It's without tax. But it's the burial, the preparation... not just the cofﬁn. Why didn't you get this? It's cheaper. We took the least ugly option. It's all ugly. This is ugly and expensive and that's ugly, but cheaper. We should have had that. You should have come. It's too late. People are coming. There they are. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. - This way. - OK. Thanks. They've sent trainees. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10... It's around forty people. So we each call ten. Can I not have Georgette. I'll put her on Alice. She was her favourite. What was that about, with Amaud and the cofﬁn? He was going on about it. He needs to assert himself. It's his way of saying: "Hey, guys, "I'm the oldest. I've got something to say." Let him be the oldest. I've been doing it for twenty years. Don't get wound up. He'll be better, now he's said his piece. Haven't you ﬁnished? Be careful, can't you? - Why are you walking like that? - I'm constipated. It's non-stop. It's a real problem. Thanks for telling us. It's nice to know. It means something, constipation. Yes. It means... someone's talking about you or there's a letter coming. Are you like this at work? Do you say that to your patients? It means you're keeping things to yourself. Is that normal? It's their way of coping. It's not much fun for kids... Dead bodies all day. Oh! Listen, Alice... We all die, one day. The girl at the funeral parlour was a bit like Mrs Guilbot. Yes! I hear the youngest Guilbots... Edouard and Marion. Are gay- Both. ‘ No! . so? So?! Out of 4 kids, 2 are gay. Weird, right? Hey? Antoine? Do you think I care? Why would 2 kids out of 4 end up gay? He's right. Lots of reasons: an overbearing mum, an absent dad. Think so? I don't see my kids, that doesn't mean... - How do you know? - I just know. I'm going to see what they're doing. See how he dodges it. He always dodges that subject. Is he with someone? - I think so. - Who? - A colleague. - A woman? Don't start. Since he went to Africa with that young Sophie Lebrac he's had no-one. That was 20 years ago. Do you talk like that in front of people? - It's funny. - It's ﬁlthy. It's not your business. It's my business if he's queer. - No. - It is. No. And don't say "queer". No. What's up? Did they ﬁx it? They're trying- That was like Louis XIV and Marcel Marceau. Poor Dad. He was handsome. Like Gary Cooper. But with a wife and 4 kids, you don't shag everything. even if you look like Gary Cooper. - Do you think it was like that? - I don't think, I know. He did it a lot, and then too much. And he paid for it. So did we. What? Is Jérome good to you? Yes. Why do you ask? He doesn't cheat or beat you? No. He's not a pervert? - Are you crazy? - No... Because... Any problems, tell me, OK? OK. - The salt cellar doesn't work. - Shhh! It doesn't matter. Yes. Was your exam all right? Good? Great. - They're not coming. - Sure? He said: "Doesn't matter." You don't say that to someone coming from New York. It's a shame his kids aren't here. Maybe it's the tickets. - They say hi. - They aren't coming? They only met Dad three times. You know kids... They've got their lives, exams. The show must go on, as they say. If it's tickets, we can... No, that's not it, thanks. - How's Sylvie? - Good. She's got a nice new guy. - Really? - Yes. What does he do? I think he's just got out of jail. Why was he... A mix-up. He stabbed some guy. I'm joking. It was a joke. Stop. I'm not 10 now. Stop! No. Stop. We're going to have an accident. Ah! I think I've got a problem. Wait for me. I've got a problem. What? - Did you change gears? - No. Alice! I told you not to change gears. The chain comes off. Why do I always get the bad bike? - Is that Dad's scarf? - It was in a drawer. I gave that to Dad. It's very nice. How much is the house worth? Why? To know how much it'll bring in. We don't want to sell it. No? I mean, I don't know. You're saying nothing? Well... Yes. We're all attached to the house, it was our holiday home. You know joint ownership? - I studied law for 6 years. - I mean really. What do you mean? It's a bad system. If you want to change a light you need written permission from everyone. The others refuse and the lights go out. - That's joint ownership. - Shit! Joint ownership can work without everyone falling out. The Guilbots managed it. They have the lights on. Hold the bike please. The Guilbot are nice guys who like holidaying together. We could have a rota. Really? And when Alice comes in August with her brats and you're on holiday? We'll make out a proper schedule. I'm with the in-laws in August. And my kids aren't brats. They are a bit. The youngest... Could we wait till after the funeral? Why? I don't know. Out of decency. The lawyer's going to be fun. Alice? What? Can you come in my room? - Why? - Come on. But not long. I took a pill... Look what I found in Dad's things. The toothbrush I gave him, and a shirt from 2 years ago. He didn't open them. ls that poplin? He didn't like my presents. He wasn't interested in me. He was never interested in me. I always said he preferred boys. But now I can really see it. You think he preferred boys? Girls meant nothing to him. Don't tell me you didn't notice. I was no trouble to him. When Mum died, I took care of you and Antoine. I was the good girl who did well at school, who didn't cause trouble, and I got nothing as a result. He did nothing for me. I got no attention. When I graduated, he didn't congratulate me. And I got great marks. He took care of Amaud's studies. Private teachers, pulling strings... just so he could do his environmental science. What counts is what you've done. You decided to be a lawyer. And you made it. You've got a good life. Like me. I chose not to work, to raise my kids, and now... Your husband hates you and you're bored. Really? I don't mean to be unkind, you could have done something. I don't know... A midwife or a nurse... In medicine. You love that. I'm not driven... Dad helped Antoine because he's a boy and with Amaud... I'm going to bed. I took a pill... No. Stay with me. Do you think Antoine's gay? I don't know. He won't talk about it, that's for sure. Hey? Now Dad's dead, it might set him free. It can free up all sorts. Hey? - It's busy. - I need a hairbrush. I'm in here. I need the plunger. The sink's blocked. Don't mind me. - Look what I found. - What? Your braces? You look like you're 15. Hey! I'm in here. Damn! I got 5 in maths. Hey! Antoine! - Antoine? - Yes. The door! Do you want layers or just straight? - Just a trim. - What? I said, just cut the ends. A centimetre, no more. OK. Just for that. I've found something. And it's not religious. It's Charles de Gaulle. It's so Dad. "When, sooner of later, the day comes to die, "when you've lived, suffered and loved "and nothing is left but your children "and the ﬁeld in which you sowed." Wow! Was De Gaulle a poet? I've got goose bumps. - What do you think? - Not much. - Not much? - No. Why? Don't know. It's not nice for the kids. "Nothing but children", meaning "not much". It means the children are the best he's left... I don't see it like that. Right. Then you'll get your Jesus and Mary. That De Gaulle's rubbish. - What? - Nothing. Just... That's a real job, you know. Damn, Alice! I'm joking. It's a joke. It's not funny. - I thought you knew how. - I do. I see. Is this vinegar? Yes. Why? Tomato and mozzarella needs olive oil, salt and that's it. - I like this. - It's not so good. It's funny how you're hooked on food. You're hooked on booze. I'm not. I stop when I want. Then stop. Can we have a nice lunch? - Did you take Dad's watch? - He won't miss it. Well, no, but... Don't start over a watch. I think we should leave Dad's stuff... until the will's settled. I like having that watch. I always saw Dad with it. I always saw him with it too. Listen, can we just eat in peace? I just need to want something for you to start wanting it too. Your jealousy's like an illness. It's funny. Tomatoes, anyone? In your defence you probably don't even notice. It's in your blood. It's your character. I'll ﬁnish it. Maybe it's not just me. Did you ask round? Do you want it? I don't know. Leave me out of it. You've already had plenty... What? Like what? What, do you want me to make a list? I want this, I want that. We know how you were with Dad. So don't start your games. You're both crazy. You need help. And I'm jealous? Shut it. Eat your tomatoes. Listen, Amaud, My conscience is clear. I got what I deserved. It's not my fault if you had problems with him. Shall we stop arguing? We're lucky to have a family. Some people are alone. And you should put your own house in order. Starting with your bedroom. What? The blue one, the yellow one, the stinky one and then Adéle's nice, big beautiful room, with a balcony, by the bathroom. - Why? - Because I painted it. It's not a joke. I bought the curtains, the bed cover... And that makes it yours? Yes. OK. Oh God. Stop! God! What are you doing? Curtains! Have you lost your mind? 0w! The carpet. Shit! There. Now it's my room. MY things! Yes. I know. OK. OK. I've stopped crying. Yes. I love you too. Bye. So what are we going to read? At your doorstep? Or the other, the boat sailing away? The boat. Come on Alice! Don't start again. I wanted the family together, to support each other. What's the point, if you don't help each other when it gets tough? Do you have a tissue? - Here. - Thanks. We talk about the Guilbots, but when their Dad died, they came together. They get on because they don't talk. Because they're a family they've decided to get on. But they're no better than us. They're just more hypocritical. Maybe, but at least they're civil to each other. They're not always at each other's throats. I don't know if you've noticed. I'm the one who wasn't asked about the watch. I'm invisible. I'm just the daft one. You suck it up. That's your problem. That's right. I get it from everyone. Do you hear how Adéle talks to me? "Do this, don't do that. Don't use vinegar." Like I was her daughter. How's her adoption going? Nowhere. No-one's in a rush to give her a kid. They saw what she's like. You should stop calling her every day. She calls me. What do you ﬁnd to talk about every day? Nothing. What we've done and seen, what we had for lunch. She tells me about her analysis. We just talk about things. Her analyst would be pleased. You know what he said? She's hung up on Mum's death and that's why she can't get pregnant. How about that? I'm glad it didn't happen to me. - Shall we get oysters? - Yes. I've had enough pété and tomatoes. And it might improve the atmosphere. Let's eat. There. Didn't you get white wine? It's on the kitchen table. Do you want some? Yes. The other glass. Careful with the bread. That's the wrong way. Do you still believe that? Well, you know, with the cat... What cat? You know - the cat that gave Agatha cancer. Are you kidding! She smoked 2 packs a day. It was her uterus, not her lungs. They took it all. Alice, please, we're eating. Where's the corkscrew? In the kitchen? They're nice. It's not here. Have you seen it? Maybe on the patio. Adéle? You haven't seen it? OK. Who's taken it? OK... That's funny. A good joke. Now give it to me. What do you mean? Careful. I'm losing patience. Can't you stop when you want? I'm just starting. Give it to me! Just look at you? You're alcoholic. - Give it! - Let me go! That hurts! ‘ Stop! ‘ Stop! You piss me off! 0w! Let me go! Help! Help! Stop! No! No! Alice? Are you OK? Alice? Let me go! You piss me off! You all piss me right off! - I'm sorry. - Shut your face! You're a pathetic loser! You scrounge off your family and off society! You've never paid in! You see your kids once a year. You don't have to be mean. You can't even have kids! I tell you, I'll put vinegar where I like when I like! You're bleeding. Let me go. You're useless! Learn resuscitation instead. That'd help. All this is your fault. If it wasn't for this birthday, Dad would be alive! What? We planned to come to surprise Dad. - "We" planned? - OK, I planned. When Dad saw us, it was a shock. And...? He had a heart attack for that? I wouldn't like to be you. - Nothing's your fault? - I wasn't there. You were there for Mum! Who told Mum that Dad was cheating? Who caused her suicide? Who! Admit it! For 20 years, no-one's said to your face! I told Mum because she couldn't see! Dad was going to leave. She had to stop him! Antoine? What? AflYifling to add? Is it true you can't have kids? Don't worry about it. It'll come. Alice? Alice? Alice? Come! Quick! - What's happening? - She's overdosed. - We have to make her vomit. - Wait. That's good. Come on. - Ow. - It's nothing. Alice? Alice? How many did you take? Alice? How many pills did you take? I emptied the packet. The oysters will be spoiled. Once it's open... - Thanks. - You're welcome. - Bye. - Bye. $0? They pumped her stomach and tested it. It seems she took two pills. Why did she say she emptied the packet? There were only two left. She emptied it of the two that were left. We slept here for nothing? Yes. Oh! Couldn't you knock? They'll see me naked. Nobody even cares. - OK? - I'm ﬁne. They emptied my stomach through a tube. Very pleasant. Did you say you were constipated? While they were at it... She doesn't want to joke. No. Not at all. Wait. It's OK. It's OK. My head hurts. You've got a bump. How did I get that? Wait for me. I'm going... I'm going to get someone. The redhead? I hope not. That's bad luck. - What? - Nothing. Come one. Dominique, this is Amaud, Alice and Adéle. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. Madame. - I'm so sorry... - Thanks. - What time's the burial? - 2 o'clock. - What? - Nothing. - Nothing to say? - No. She's pretty and young for her age. How old do you think she is? I don't know. - How old? - No idea. She's 52. Like I said. She looks younger. Just one question. I knew it. Why would a 35-year-old guy - good looking, good job, a bit daft, but basically a nice guy - want to get off with... let's not mince words: an old woman? Wait. What? It's not normal. There must be a reason. Get the psychologist. Hey? Stop asking. I don't know. Well... If you're happy... - Are you happy? - Yes. Good. What's that? Poor animal. At least it won't hurt anyone now. Ah! It was a female. - You see those? - Yes. - The teats? - Her nipples. - Let's go? - Sshh! Oh! - Oh! - Oh! So sweet! Come on, you. He'll think you're his mum. They're so sweet. It's later they turn nasty. OK. Put them down. Let's go. They'll get eaten. So we won't have to drown them. We'll be stuck with them. It's going to be a good day. Sad, but good. Do you remember when we were kids? When it was nice, Dad would take one of us, early, to go for a swim. How good it felt to hear it was someone else. The relief. Especially when it was Adéle. - I'd be laughing. - You sod. It would have been a day like this. Who would it have been? Subtitles: Eclair Group
