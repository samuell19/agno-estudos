So, once I sign this, people will buy my DVD, right? Of course. For eternity. Wow. Thank you. You see? You see what I do to sell my DVD? ( music playing ) Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Adam Ferrara! ( cheering ) Oh, thank you. Thank you. Oh, thank you so much. How nice was that? It's-- God, it's so nice to be back home. I was all over the place. I was in Jamaica. Yeah, I flew Air Jamaica. That's like a Bob Marley tour bus in the sky. The captain gets on Air Jamaica like, ( Jamaican accent ) "This is your captain speaking. ( giggles ) Don't look at me, man. Don't look at me. I can't do it now. I'll call you back." ( clicks ) Everybody's stoned in Jamaica. Everybody. The customs agent. I'm like, "You need to stamp my passport?" ( Jamaican accent ) "No. I'll just draw a bird. ( snickers ) Silly white boy. Look, it flies." It's the strongest coffee I've ever had in my life down there. That Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee. I had to drink that on the toilet. 'Cause there's just no time. That stuff hits my little Caucasian digestive system, and the little man that controls the valve is in a hazmat suit. He's like, "Dump it. Dump it all. Just dump it. This is not a drill. ( imitates alarm sounding ) Emergency blow. Watch your shoes!" And they know, the Jamaicans know. ( Jamaican accent ) "Look, the white people had the coffee. Look at the way they're running. Look it." "It's not funny, man!" I was all over the place. I was in Venice. Venice is beautiful, man. Has anybody been to Venice? - ( applause ) - Gorgeous, isn't it? Oh! That's like old-world romance. Guys, if you can't get laid in Venice, turn your balls in at the nearest drop box. You grab a girl, you get in the gondolas, they got the Italian guy singing to you. These are real Italian guys, not like the guys in my neighborhood, like, ( New York accent ) "Hey! Get the broad! Get in the boat! Come here! Don't be a pussy. This is beautiful shit we got over here!" These are the real Italian guys. ( singing in Italian ) Amore! ( Italian accent ) Go ahead! I no look. I went to Rome. Saw the Vatican. You ever see the Vatican? - ( cheering ) - Yeah. It's tacky. It's overdone. It's like Graceland with Jesus. It's too much. Thank you for laughing. My mother hates that joke. I did that on TV about three months ago. She's still not talking to me. She hands the phone to my father when I call up now. ( imitates phone ring ) "Hello?" "Hi, Ma. Did you see Letterman?" "Joe, it's him. Mm-mm." My mother's a hardcore Catholic. She has an oscillating Jesus fan in the living room. "I'm dead. Your fault." That's the symbol in the Catholic religion-- Jesus hanging on a cross and he died for your sins. They told me that when I was a little boy. "Jesus died for you, Adam." Oh! What have I done? I couldn't go to church. I was terrified. And I always pictured Jesus doing this. "You happy now?" At least Buddha was a fat guy flipping a pizza like, "Who's hungry? Rub my belly for luck, there's no judgments here. Lucky numbers-- 2, 5, 11, 40." See, I'm of the belief that there's one god but there's many different religions, so it's just a question of which long distance company you pick. The Pope came to New York. Did you see him? He's cute, isn't he? Little German Pope? He's cute, but he's got that look in his eye, you know? I can't explain it, it's just kind of like... You don't know what he's thinking, like, ( German accent ) "Took Poland in 27 days!" He's gonna snap any minute, man. Especially when it comes to reform or something. ( German accent ) "There will be no changes. There will be no women priests! Boys will not kiss boys! Und nobody wears a condom. Jesus loves you. In the name of the Father, und the Son, und the Holy Spirit. Hitler! Nobody saw that! Hogan, get the car." God's gonna get us all killed. Terrorists convince thousands of people to kill themselves in the name of God. I can't convince two of my friends to help me move. And I think human arrogance will the demise of human civilization. Look, if you think God is talking to you, and you understand God, and God needs you to kill somebody else for him, if that's what you truly feel, just sit down till that feeling goes away. 'Cause I'm fairly certain if God wants somebody dead, that guy is dead, okay? He don't need you. He's got the key to the lightning cabinet. So just settle down, you arrogant, finite, carbon-based life form. Really hardcore religious people that can't accept someone else's non-violent code of conduct are dangerous to society, and they smell fucking awful. I don't-- I don't know what the correlation is. The closer people think they get to God, the further away from soap and water they have to be. It doesn't matter what religion it is. I sat next to a Hasidic Jew on a plane. I tried to roll down the window at 30,000 feet. "Are you kidding me? Can't you pray and bathe at the same time?" I met a maharishi from India. He smelled like curried... shit. It was so bad, my nose spoke. My nose actually said, "What is that? Tell the eyes to find a way out and get the feet moving. Namas-go." I met a hippie chick from Berkeley. She stunk! I still slept with her, but she stunk. Nah, I was with a girl for five years and we didn't make it. We never married. Marriage was a woman's idea. I figured that out. Yeah, there was no cavemen somewhere like, "Me only have sex with you. No work out, take half my stuff." ( no audible dialogue ) Thank you, and why my impression of a caveman just sounded like an American Indian, I don't know. It did, didn't it? "White man lie to us. We open casino." And there's tremendous social pressure to be married. Society wants you to be married. Married people want you to be married. It's like a pyramid scheme, really. It's an emotional pyramid scheme. I guess they figure, "Look, I'm not happy with my life. If I can get two other people..." I learned a lot, though, I did. Gentlemen, I learned if you live with a woman, and there's only one bathroom in your home, give it to her... go shit in the yard. Trust me. It's humiliating, but you'll save a lot of conflict. They need room for all their supplies. You should've seen all the stuff in the shower. Puffs, and scrubs, and lotions. The upkeep on a 1975 Jewish girl is amazing. I didn't know what half the stuff was. You know, for two days I washed my hair with apricot facial scrub. It was all greasy and matted down. I looked liked a Pakistani nightclub owner. ( Pakistani accent ) "Welcome to Club Karachi. Come, come. Ladies night. Girls, veils, half-masked. Come, come, my friend." Believe me, I know it's not easy living with me. I'm a comic. I'm an insecure egomaniac. You know how big my ego is? I keep a journal and I'm lying in it. Is that alarming to anybody else? I read it the other day, I'm like, "I didn't invent the cotton gin. What?" I have no patience, I'm very immature, I have a temper, I yell. But I'm a good guy. I am. Look, I know we just met, but I'm a lovely little man. I really am. I will instinctually make the virtuous choice to benefit humanity. I'm very proud of that. I believe in humanity. People suck. People just suck. I'll let you into traffic. If I don't get that little wave, now I have to run you off the road! What am I, the Bandit running blocker for you, Snowman? And I get so angry. You know how angry I get? I gave myself Tourette's. Do you ever give yourself Tourette's? Did you ever twitch and blurt out obscenities for no apparent reason? I'm usually all alone, driving in a car, it's a nice day, but out of nowhere, just, "Fuck!" That can't be healthy, can it? Just random spikes of fury coming out of you? I get it from my father. My father's either pissed off or asleep. I asked him, I said, "Pop, how come you're so angry?" "Helps to hold down the rage." My father's got exquisite anger. Just mwah! It's total communication. You're never gonna look at my father and think, "Mm, I wonder what's on his mind." I got arrested when I was 16 years old. Kid stuff. Stole a car. So... The local cops find me. They say, "Come on, kid. We're gonna take you home." "No, no, no, no, no. Lock me up, give me the chair, but don't wake my father up." They take me to the station, they call my father. "Mr. Ferrara, we have your son here at the fourth precinct." "Yeah? Keep him." He made me spend the night in jail. In the morning, I heard the truck pull up, I looked out of the cell. Out of the corner of the cell, I see him, he's signing the-- he doesn't say a word, he's just sitting. He looks into the cell and just goes... A 20-year police captain opened up the bars like this, ( laughing ) "Oh, fuck!" I get my communication skills from my father, too, which is nothing. Absolutely nothing. He's 66 years old. He's down to grunts at this point in his life. "Pop, you hungry?" ( grunts ) "Pop, you cold?" ( grunts ) "Pop, how'd the Mets do?" "Ah!" And that's what killed my relationship. Well, that'll kill any relationship, if you can't communicate. That's the key to a relationship. That's how you build intimacy, through communication. It's very important to talk and listen to your partner so you can both grow as a unit. And when life throws you little things, you can really be prepared. It's just talking and talking and talking. And I was listening to every word 'cause I thought, you know, there was a point. There's no point. You know how some people hire maids, they hire nannies? I should've hired a gay guy for her to talk to. 'Cause there were so many things I just didn't care about. "Should I reupholster this couch or get a new one? I don't know what to do with this room. What do you think?" "Ramon, you're up! Let's go, you're on the clock." It was a psychotic, babbling conveyor belt of nonsense. "I went to get my nails done, but they didn't have the polish I want. So they put on clear coat, but it obviously has a pink tinge to it. Look at that. Doesn't that look pink to you? I told them to square off the tips, but they round them. I don't speak Korean. How the hell am I supposed to communicate?" ( screams ) Somebody help me! And Ramon would come running in. ( effeminate Spanish accent ) "What you do? You can't talk to him like that. His head will explode!" "Why does she do that, Ramon?" "I don't know, honey, but I'm here. Now, come on. You come with me now, baby. I'm gonna sit you on the couch, I pour you a little tequila, we put on ESPN, you watch the rednecks play poker. You like that, papi, yes." ( sniffles ) "Thank you, Ramon. I wish you had a vagina." "I know, honey. So do I." So we started therapy soon after that. I figured if I'm talking to imaginary gay guys, it's time to get help. I went. We went to the couple's therapy. I sat there, I looked at the guy, I said, "All right, doc, what do we do?" "Well, Adam, you see, I can't tell you what to do." "Really? For $125 an hour, could you put out cheese maybe? Why don't you pull your beard, look like you're thinking? What do these diplomas mean, Sigmund?" He said, "Okay, we're gonna play a game called Total Honesty." "Okay, this guy's a moron." "What?" "Nothing, just warming up." So she looks at me and she goes, "Adam, you don't listen. It's very frustrating. I talk to you, I talk to you, and talk to you, and you don't listen. You just don't listen." "I know. I'm trying, baby, I really am, it's just that... I don't care. I don't want to lie to you, honey. You are the most important person to me. I love you, I will support you, I will take a bullet for you, baby. Just shut up, could you, please?" "You see, doctor? This is what he does, he comes to close to real emotion and he makes a joke out of it, because he can't-- and don't you laugh at him. You're encouraging this behavior. We have very serious problems here. You know, I think he might be homosexual. He screams out the name Ramon in his sleep, okay?" The doctor did say something I didn't get at the time, but it proved to be true later on. He goes, "Adam, see, the problem is you've come from two different backgrounds." "Doctor, this is a fascinating theory. Possibly because we're not brother and sister. Did you ever think of that?" 'Cause, culturally, it wasn't that big a stretch. I'm Italian, Catholic, she's Jewish, and the values are the same. It's food, family, and guilt. Her family, the guilt's better, and my family, the food's better. 'Cause Jewish food, man. "Happy Hanukkah. Here's your bowl of 'blech', there you go. Is the 'hakakch' fresh? Everybody save room for... ( guttural hawking, then spits ) You like our food, Adam?" "Yeah, yeah, horseradish and shit. This is wonderful. You know, if the bread was leavened, it would ruin everything." "We also eat bitter herbs." "You people have suffered enough. Order a pizza, Jesus Christ." I'm sorry, I just always wanted to say that to her, and I never did. I remember the food at the holidays. We used to go to her house for that holiday they got called Passover. You leave the door open, waiting for Elijah. We were there all night. This guy never showed. I played along with them, though. "Is that him? Does Elijah have a Mercedes? MD plates? Dr. Elijah? No? Sorry." Her mother was pissed. You should've seen her trying to defend me. "It's okay, Ma, he's a comedian." "No, he's an asshole, okay? He's in there with two yarmulkes on his chest like a bra. He's got the dreidel out, playing roulette with your cousins. They're betting on gimel, it's a shanda." One of the cultural differences that proved to be challenging was, I learned this from her, Jews are raised to ask questions. You have to ask questions like, "Why? How come? How much? That much? Why should I spend that much?" And, Italians, we don't want to ask questions 'cause we don't want any information. "Look, I didn't see nothin', I don't know nothin'. Don't subpoena me, all right?" So the questions started driving me crazy. It was question after question. Morning, noon and night with the questions. It was like falling asleep with a Spanish radio station on. Yo quiero pregunta, pregunta, pregunta. Yo quiero pregunta, pregunta, pregunta. Hijole! What is with the questions, ladies? Why do you think we possess some mysterious knowledge we're keeping from you? We go to see a movie, she's like, "Now, who's that guy?" "Did I write this fucking thing? I came in with you. How the hell do I know who that guy is? What do you want me to do, show up early? Do me a favor, fast-forward. She's gonna have questions I need to know the answers to. I don't know, she thinks I'm smart or something." And every guy I speak to says the same thing, "Yeah, well... what are you gonna do?" And there's nothing you can do. Nothing. God designed the dyadic unit for survival, for procreation, for achievement. 'Cause the rest of this world doesn't care about you. The rest of this world's gonna tell you, "No, you can't." When you fall in love, the person that believes in you is gonna tell you, "Of course you can." Christopher Columbus discovered a new world. Think about that. The prevailing belief at that time was the Earth is flat. People were terrified. "You're gonna sail off the end of it into oblivion. In the seas are giant serpents that are gonna swallow you whole." And Columbus didn't care. He made that voyage anyway. You know why? Mrs. Columbus would not shut up, that's why. And he filled up three boats with guys willing to take that risk. He told them all, "Gentlemen, this mission is certain death." "I no care, Chris. Her mother, she live with us. No leave me here!" So, you know what? But it works. The design does work. I achieved more when I was with her than I thought I ever could, and she made me a better man. And, for some reason, I thought she was smarter than me, but I learned this. Gentlemen, your wife, your girlfriend, mother of your kids, the one you'll take that bullet for? She's just as stupid as you, you know that? How smart can she be? She picked you, so... Life is scary. Hold on to each other, fuck when you can, fight when you have to, and ride it out. And you wonder why she left me. "Fuck when you can, fight when you have to?" Yeah, let's get that embroidered on a pillow. That's really gonna brighten up the family room, you miscreant." So she leaves, right? It's all over. I'm sitting in my parent's basement. I'm a grown man living in my parent's basement. I crawled inside a bottle of Maker's Mark. I stayed there for about three weeks. Oh, it's warm in Kentucky. Middle of the night, my father comes down the stairs, he's wearing a robe, he's got a Lucky Strike and a baseball bat. He takes one look at me and he just goes, "Ah. Yup. Ah." "Thanks, Pop." Sat down next to me, grabbed the bottle. It's the first time I ever had a drink alone with my father. Took a hit, turned around and just said, "Women. What are you gonna do?" He said, "You know, son, a married guy's gonna die before his wife. And a single guy is gonna die before a married guy. So, when it comes to death, women are carriers." "What?" "Yes. I love your mother. I love your mother with all my heart, but she is going to kill me." "No, Pop, it was me, I messed it up." "You didn't mess nothing up. What'd you do? Did you yell? Ooh. Let me guess, you didn't listen." "Yeah, how'd you know?" "Psh. How'd I know? I'll tell you something. Women are very sensitive, okay? Very emotional. They're kind, they're nurturing. They're beautiful, ain't they? And every one of them is full of shit." "What?" "They're full of shit. They don't want you to talk to them. They don't want you to listen to them. They want you to agree with them. And if you don't agree with them, they just keep talking and talking and talking until you do. It's not a conversation. It's erosion. They will talk and talk, and ask again, rephrase, wait three days, bring it up one more time, till finally you just go, 'Fine. You know what, honey? Do whatever the hell you want to do.' And then she'll look at you and say, 'See? I'm glad we talked about it.'" My parents-- my parents have been married for 40 years. They fight. My father hasn't picked up the phone in my house in 40 years. Drives my mother crazy, man. "Did you hear the friggin' phone?" "Yep. Leave it alone. It'll stop." "Why don't you answer it?" "It's never good news, that's why. Someone's gonna ruin my day, I'm gonna make them work for it." So I bought 'em an answering machine. I figured that'll solve the problem. My mother's like, "Joe, I want you to leave the message. I want people to hear a man's voice ( whispers ) when they call the house." "All right. What the hell is this thing here, now? 'Push here to record your greeting, what your callers will...'" Beep. "All right, look, I ain't giving you a ride, I ain't got any money, I don't care who's dead, and I ain't calling you back." Beep. That was on for three days before she caught it. And another week after that 'cause they couldn't figure out how to get it off. They fight, but I know they love each other. After 40 years, my father still holds my mother's hand. Like, "Ma, he's yelling, but he loves you. He's still holding your hand." "'Cause he's afraid I'm gonna hit him, that's why." We hit a bump this year. My pop got cancer. And I hope your family's never faced with it, but if you got to go through it, you're quickly gonna learn the character of the people you come from, and I was very proud of my old man 'cause I panicked when he told me. I was on the road. I called him in the hospital. I said, "Pop, I just heard. I'm coming, all right?" "Don't worry, this is nothing. It's not like it used to be. They got all kinds of stuff there today. They just knock this right out." "How you doing?" "How am I doing? I got a pipe in my pecker. How's your day going?" So we all showed up, the whole family showed up. Well, one of my brothers couldn't be there 'cause something happened and it wasn't his fault, and it's never his fault, but something always happens and I shouldn't judge because I don't know. There's one in every family. There's one in every friggin' family. And if you don't know who I'm talking about, it's you. So, we're sitting in the doctor's office and the doctor's telling me and my other brother, "Look, I don't want you boys to worry. This cancer isn't hereditary. This comes from one thing and one thing only." "Oh! Please say Jell-O. Come on, Jell-O." "No, cigarettes." Fuck. I'm all out of excuses. So I quit. I quit right then. 'Cause in that moment, my parents got old right in front of me. My pop's 66, but he's a hard 66. He's got the cancer, he had a 90% blockage in his heart we had to fix. He's a diabetic. He shoots himself up twice a day with this insulin they make from a lizard hormone. It works, his blood sugar's fine, but in the afternoons he likes to sun himself on a hot rock. Keeps trying to sell me auto insurance. And my mother's at that age where women start to dress like Elvis. You know the big rhinestone, sequined, jump suit-y things? And the hip is bad, so she swivels when she walks. "Ma, are there any leftovers?" "♪ Uh-huh " They still live in the house I grew up in. Except now it's got that grandma house smell. You know the grandma house smell? It's like moth balls and disappointment, you know? "Ma, is there any Lysol?" "Yeah, it's on the shelf next to the broken dreams." So, came time for the chemo, and I sat my pop down. I called in every favor I had. I got my hands on some money, I greased who I had to grease. We're in the garage, and I told him, I said, "All right, Pop, look, it's all taken care of. I got you to the best hospital in the city, all right? Don't ask me how, don't ask me why, but your name is on the top of that list. All I need you to do is walk through that door and I want you to beat this thing down, you hear me?" "Yeah, kid, thanks. You stepped up, don't think I don't notice that, huh? Good man. But we go for this chemo thing, uh, we're gonna go over here by the house." I said, "Pop, look at me, I got you the best shot we got at beating this." "Yeah, I know son. And, uh, looked at that city hospital, I really did. But this is gonna be a two, three-month deal and where you got to go, it's got all those stairs and your mother don't climb the stairs that good no more, so that can't work for us." He's looking right down the barrel at it, and his priority is my mother can't climb no stairs no more. That's the same man made me shovel the driveway with a broken arm. "Pop, I can't hold the shovel." "Stick it in your ass and walk backwards." And I got it. In that moment, I got it. He's the head of the house. That's his woman. Whether that's right or wrong, healthy or not, he's gonna take care of her. And that's how he defines himself. And I got that from my old man, too. That's why when she left, I was a mess. I had nowhere to go. I didn't know what to do. I was like one of those sharks you see on the Discovery Channel. You know when they smack them in the nose with a bang stick? Like... I started getting panic attacks. You ever get a panic attack? Yeah, that's a nice way to go through life. "What a lovely day." ( screams ) And the only way you get rid of a panic attack is you have to talk about it. Yeah, I'm gonna call up my friends. "Hey, Philly. I think I'm getting panic attacks." "Really? You ever think you're a pussy? Did you ever think of that? I mean, I'm no doctor, but you could be a pussy, it's all I'm saying. Well, it sounds like acute pussy syndrome to me, sweetheart. Check your urine. Is it pink?" I was a mess. I could-- I went to see a shrink. I'm such an Italian, too. My friends are like, "So how's it going with the shrink?" "He didn't get nothing out of me. I love my mother, I ain't gonna roll on her." They put me on Zoloft. That's fun. Your mouth dries up, you start shaking. This is much better. Oh, I can't wait for the anal leakage. This is... That's what I need, is a wet ass and a positive attitude. That's just what I'm looking for. ♪ It's a Zoloft life for me I just had a bad year, man. Did you guys have a good year or a bad year? ( man coughs loudly ) How's the tuberculosis. Is everything better? Jesus. What the hell was that? You just coughed up a bar stool. What was that? ( growling cough ) "Let's put this in the foyer. It's from the mucus collection." Are you all right, pal? You sure? Check your nuts. One of them dropped. I think I heard something hit the floor. I tell you, I had a bad year. Did you guys have a good year or a bad year? ( crowd murmuring, scattered cheers) Oh, yeah. Yeah? You had a good year? Nice. "We had a good year. We all found Jesus and the dog started shitting diamonds." I had an awful year. I was watching the New Year's countdown like this, "Hurry up! Let's go!" And then it was Dick Clark with the stroke. "Eight, seven, seven, seven." Oh, come on. Somebody want to give Dick a shove, please? "Seven, six. Happy 1988." I believe in karma, though. You believe in karma? - Oh. - ( cheering ) Do you ever think to yourself, "What the hell did I do in a past life to get the ride I'm on now"? Did I give Lincoln the theatre tickets? What the hell did I do? "Abe, front row, balcony. Take the wife. It's on me. Go." But I understand that you shouldn't do the right thing because you fear punishment or you expect profit. You should do the right thing 'cause the right thing is the right thing to do. Can I get an amen? ( cheers and applause ) Mm-hmm. And it works. Karma works. I got a girl now. Oh, that's what daddy likes. She's beautiful. She gives me permission to be positive. It's very important for a guy like me, 'cause I come from people that don't know what to do with happy. You know when happy shows up like, "Hey, aren't we having a good time?" "Yeah, well, shit can happen." And she's beautiful. Ugh. The female form is just enchanting. Guys, think about your woman. Everything is shaped nice, it's all soft and tucked in, and mysterious, and hair, no hair, hair, no hair. You ever see a naked guy? Disgusting. Aberrant patches of hair just missing from it. Two balls dangling down. It looks like a Christmas tree in January. Just standing there waiting for someone to put it away, like... "Come on, man, it's cold." She's beau-- just the way she arches her back reaching for the orange juice in the morning, I want to tackle her right there on the kitchen floor. ( high-pitched ) "You want some juice, baby?" "Come here." ( high-pitched ) "What's the matter with you?" "You're wearing the red underwear. What'd you think was gonna happen? Stay still." ( grunts ) Just find somebody to love that loves you back. Doesn't matter who it is, your family ain't gonna like them anyway, you know that. Your family thinks they know what's best for you. Religion will tell you who you can choose from. Even the government. The president actually wants to make a constitutional amendment prohibiting gay marriage, which goes against... I don't know, the very foundation of the country? "All men are created equal. Except these faggots over here." Did you read the thing before you took the job? Who cares? Suck a dick, sing a song, pay your taxes. Just knock it off with the parades. Any gay people here? We get it. You're a festive bunch. Knock it off. I like women. You don't see me tying up traffic for the annual pussy festival, do you? Of course, I'd hold it in the spring. I march in the gay pride parade every year in New York City. Not for support. I got to get across Sixth Avenue to get home. Every year, it's the same thing. "All right, Dorothy, give me the sign. Yeah, yeah, yeah." My friend David's gay. He's getting married and his mother's upset that the guy's not Jewish. Some people just have a line in the sand. I was at the engagement party. His mother was drunk. Like, "Well, apparently, it's too much to ask that the bride be circumcised." You look at a group of people that had faith, it's got to be the Jews. The Jews followed Moses through the desert for 40 years with no map. There had to be one guy in the back, like, "Hey, I don't think he knows where he's going. ( exhales ) 40 years? What, are you kidding me? I was ten when we started this thing. That footprint? Mine, 15 years ago. Circles. We're walking in circles! No, no, don't shush me, Sheila. Enough is enough. I don't give a damn if he hears me or not. You're lost, Moses, you cock-eyed bastard. Get the bags. We'll open a deli. This is bullshit." Don't get me wrong, I believe in God, I just hope he doesn't write stuff down. 'Cause I made a lot of deals with God, and if I get audited... He's gonna pull my file and send down some leg-breaking angel to collect. ( imitates wings flapping ) "Excuse me, chuckle boy. Let's review. 'Please don't let her be pregnant, and I'll never do it again.' 'I'll never drink again.' 'I'll never drink again.' 'I'll never drink again.' 'Please don't let her be pregnant, and I'll never drink again.'" Yes. I believe in God. I believe in the spiritual precept of wholeness. We're given everything we need. The answers lie within. ( deep voice ) Go within, my son. I have no time to meditate. None. I live in New York City, I have A.D.D., I have a caffeine addiction, I'm an American. We're not known for our patience. We just started a war without double-checking the facts. Are you kidding me? "They're buying uranium from Africa." "Really?" "That's what Randy told me. Send them in." And the world hates us. The world can't stand us, man. ( French accent ) "Oh, those Americans. You know they wash themselves every day?" 'Cause the rest of the world thinks Americans are arrogant. And, you know... fuck you. Yeah, we're arrogant people. This is a horrible country. That's why everyone's coming here for a better life. How many people have a timeshare in Yemen? Anyone? Go during the stoning season. It's fabulous. Who needs Disneyland? I was just in Florida, too. My grandma passed away. ( audience sighs ) Oh, thank you. She was 92 with one leg. We saw it coming. But my dopey cousins are at the funeral like, "Why?" She's 92 with one leg. Why? How about, "What took so long?" My grandmother's last words were, ( rasping ) "Fucking finally." She had everything wrong with her. Every system was shutting down. Parts were falling off the woman. She wouldn't go, man. She was like a Dodge Dart. You couldn't kill her. The doctors were coming out of her hospital room like... Yeah. Night before they take her leg off, I'm sitting in her hospital room, rubbing her little head. She had that dandelion hair. You know, it was white, and there wasn't a lot of it, like a dandelion. You just wanted to go up behind her like, "Make a wish." ( Italian accent ) "What you do to my hairs?" I never felt so helpless in all my life. She was comforting me. I'm like, "Grandma, what can I do?" She's like, "Adamo, there's nothing you can do. It's not you, Adamo. It's God, you know? God, he wants me, just, uh, not all at once." So she finally passes away, we go to the funeral. And if you've never seen Italians lay their dearly departed to rest, it's very tasteful. Flowers all over the body. Big horseshoe flowers, like she won the Kentucky Derby or something. "Good luck in Heaven." I'm standing over the body, tears are falling out of my eyes. My dopey cousin leans in like, "She looks good, huh? Not too much makeup, they sewed the mouth straight. This is beautiful work we're looking at here." "What the fuck is wrong with you?" "What? She looks peaceful. That's all I'm trying to tell you." "Of course she looks peaceful. She's dead, you idiot. What'd you expect her to look like? Like a beaver getting hit by a truck? It's a funeral. It's a somber occasion. How many times have you heard, 'How was the funeral?' 'Rowdy. She got up.' What?" Did you ever get a good look at your family and think to yourself, "If I wasn't related to them, I'd have nothing to do with these people"? We're back at the house, he's eating, he's like, ( smacks lips ) "This prosciutto's fresh. That's the way she would've wanted it." "No. You know what she would've wanted? You dead and her here eating the prosciutto. That's what she would've wanted. She never liked you, jackass." They're lunatics. Absolute lunatics. My other cousin comes up to me, he's like, "Look, I understand this is a very stressful time for all of us. The sadness is upon us. Maybe you want some ecstasy?" I said, "I can't even have dairy. What, are you kidding me?" He goes, "Look, I got something here, gonna make you see the big picture. Really gonna open up your eyes about a lot of things, okay? I got acid." "Acid? What, did you just get out of a time warp? Who the hell has acid?" "The only thing is, you got to be careful. See, there's good trips and there's bad trips. Whatever's on your mind when you come onto the acid, that's the kind of trip you're gonna have." "I don't want any of this, okay? I don't need my mortgage coming to life. Please, I just... It's bad enough it's on my back for 30 years, I don't need it sitting on the couch talking to me." "I'm never getting any smaller, you know that. I'm not getting any smaller." "My savings is melting!" They're out-- my family's out of their minds. I got an Uncle Tony. We call him "Uncle 8 o'clock." Every time he comes over to our house, "Hi, Uncle Tony." "Look, if anybody asks, I've been here since 8 o'clock, all right?" He's always got a scam, Uncle Tony. When he wants to mail a letter, he puts the address he wants it to go to where the return address goes, and throws it in the mailbox without a stamp. It gets marked "insufficient postage" and sent to the return address. I'm like, "Uncle Tony, you know, that's mail fraud. "Nah, nah." That's brilliant. What, are you kidding me? Male fraud is like a chick with a dick or something. You know how cool my Uncle Tony was? He used to drive me to school. He would pull over five blocks before we got there, let me get behind the wheel so the kids could see me rolling up. I was 12. He'd pick me up after school. He had this giant Buick Electra. And he smoked those De Nobili cigars. They stunk. They were like Jersey in a wrapper, just... ( man boos ) Man: Yes! He's like, "What'd they learn you in school today?" "Well, Uncle Tony, they told us if you give a man a fish, he eats for a day. But if you teach a man to fish, he eats for the rest of his life." "All right, that's wrong. You give a man a fish, that man owes you a fish and a half. Every day he don't pay you back, it goes up another half a fish. You don't get no fish a couple, three weeks, you got to break his rod and reel and send a message, kid, all right? Who are you, Mrs. Paul, giving away all this fish for God's sake? Sink his boat. That'll get his attention. I lost my virginity when I was 14 years old... to a woman who was 38. Hold your applause. ( light applause ) I had nothing to do with it. There's a knock on the door. "Hello?" "You Adam? Uncle Tony says Happy Birthday. Stay still." Two seconds later, I'm standing there in this confused state of euphoria and the phone rings. ( imitates phone ringing ) "Hello?" ( laughs ) "Don't tell your mother." I go to see him now, he denies everything. Denies everything. "I don't know what you're talking about. I don't know what this person is or where you get these stories from. Get out of here. My grandkids are here. Knock it off." I know he's different now he's got grandkids. My girlfriend and I are talking about having a baby. Well, she talks about it and I black out. I don't know what kind of father I'm gonna be. And we're all products of our parents. All your mother's traits are in the egg and all your father's traits are in the sperm. And, if I know my parents, that sperm and egg had a fight. My mother's egg-- "I have been waiting for you for 28 days. You're late. Where have you been?" "Don't start with me. I have been swimming my ass off out there. I'm sitting in traffic, some guy's tail's waving in my face. There's a recessive gene in front of me doing this shit." Yeah, so I don't know. I don't know what kind of father I'm gonna be, but I'll tell you one thing, that kid's gonna shovel the driveway, damn it. Thanks for coming to see me, folks. ( cheering and applause) Thank you. ( music playing ) All right. ( music fades ) I've had it with all of you. Thank you so much for being a part of this night for me, folks. I really appreciate it. Get home safe and just go home and fuck while you still love each other. Good night, folks. Take care. ( music playing )
