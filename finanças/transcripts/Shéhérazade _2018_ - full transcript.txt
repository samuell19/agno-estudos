You'll bring the cops here. Not at all. What do you mean? A wanted man can't sell for me. Are you crazy? Neither the cops nor the home will come here. Not the home, but your caseworker will. She'll find you dealing. Then what? Why would she come? She'll call the judge. I was in homes before you. Stop bullshiting. I grew up here, guys. What do I do? Who gives a shit where you grew up? What do I do? I don't even have a place to sleep. - What do I do? - Stop pissing us off. No work for you. Don't bring him here anymore. Take him back to the home. What do you want me to say? You've acted stupid your whole life. What else can I say? What's going on? Seriously, son. I'm fucking pissed. Don't worry. Why the fuck do you care? Who cares? You're here. We've got you, bro. - Take that. Keep it, come on. - No. - Don't worry. - Are you kidding? Don't tell the others, all right? Check that out! She's busted. Let's be honest. I wouldn't touch her if you paid me. You're not interested? That's a tricky one. She's for you. Stop it! She's a total cougar. Speed up. I'll get scared and have nightmares. - Go, go! - Speed up. There's some chicks. Should I make a stop? Look at her. Not bad. There's potential on this side. Fresh meat. Pull over. - Hey. - Got any hash? Hi, girls. - What are you up to, working? - Yeah. I brought you my pal, he just got out of jail. - He's hungry? - Yeah? He's hungry? - He's a handful. - He's got money? - He's a devil, but a sweetheart. - He's nice. - He's got money? - It's all good. Show us your pretty face. You're the king. Which one do you choose? Tell me which one. Let him pick. My treat. My treat. Her, her, her, or her. I think I know her. - You're working too? - No. Stop saying you're not working. I was going to pick you. That's mean. Shoot. Seriously, are you working? I'll pay you. I'm no thief. You think I'll screw you over? - I'll pay you. Come over. - First of all... Get down when I talk to you. Why should I? Come up here. Did you go to Rosa Parks? Right? - Don't lie. You don't remember me? - No. Come on. For real? Come down for a sec. - You don't remember me? - Honestly, no. - Really? - No. - You don't look familiar. - Your name is Shéhérazade. - Yeah, that's right - You don't remember? - What's your name? - Zach. You have the money? Here. That's money? Yes, that's money. That's hash. In Marseille, that's money. It's worth 180 euros. You take half and I keep half. Here. - Let's split when we're done. - Whatever you want. Take your clothes off. That's your style? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Come on. - I don't obey orders. What do you mean? Can't we talk first? Are you a hooker or not? You're like the others. You don't respect women. Wow. Are you trying to play me? Not at all. There are no feelings. I respect women. - I just don't respect hookers. - All right. Fine. Take your clothes off. Let's go. You're in for a rough time. You'll see. Have a drag. I'll be right back. - Where are you going? - To get a condom. - Hurry up. - Yeah. Fuck! Hey! Hey! I wouldn't mind doing one. I wouldn't mind. Go ahead. He's splitting. - What's up, girls? - Well, cousin? - What's up? - Chilling. Your friend is not here? No? Wasn't she with you? She's too expensive for me. - She's not here? - We last saw her leaving with you. Okay, thanks. - You're welcome. - If you need something, come by. Sure thing. Come back any time. Cutie pie. I do fake eyelashes. Midnight blue. I like them. They're simple. It's true. It's not bad. It's a good one. Who's this? - Let go of me. - Shut the fuck up. I told you to let go of me. Let go of me! Get off! Don't touch me! Stop it! Stop it! - Where's my hash? - I don't have it. Keep talking like that and you'll end up on the floor. I'm waiting. For the last time, I'm asking you nicely where my hash is. I don't have it. Don't touch me. I told you not to touch me. Shut the fuck up. Stop it! - If you don't... - There's nothing, okay? Don't scream, you bitch! Don't even try to run. I'll find you and bury your ass. - People are staring at us. Get off. - I'll do what I want. Don't hold me. You don't get it. People are staring at us. I don't care. You don't think I would have liked to talk to you? - But no. - You shouldn't have disrespected me. - You pissed me off. - I don't give a shit. - This one. - Right here? Hey! - What are you doing here? - I'm getting the hash back. - What hash? - Why ask her? She gave you my hash. So what? Who the hell are you? - Give me my hash back. - Get out of my store, please. What store? - Take it easy. - Don't touch me. Wait for me! Come! Yeah. We showed that motherfucker. Here we go. Hello. - Hello, Zachary. - Hello. Take a seat. So... We weren't supposed to meet today. You've been out for five days and you've already skipped parole. That's not true, ma'am. That's not true? Well... That's what shows in the report from your group home. What's in the report is like a delay. See? It should have been written down somewhere. You simply think you were late? That's a detail. Then why did the counselors write you were gone for a day if you were just late? It's because I was hiding. I needed to be by myself. All right. I'll let your caseworker speak. I'd like to mention his release. Zach was really expecting to see his mom. It was very hard for him at that time. I picked him up myself. He was really upset. He went on a few joyrides. Which obviously goes against the rules. But apart from that, he's only been in the home for five days. So, yeah. We realize that. Clearly, some mistakes were made by the staff. But it really wouldn't be a good idea for you to go back to your mom's. Why? Simply because your mom is unemployed. - You used to be out of control. - She wants me back. I want to go home. Your mom doesn't help you. Not much at all. She tries her best, but she can't help you. She does help me. She wants me back and all. Because she can help me. Listen, Zachary. I've decided to send you to a group home in Toulon. The idea is for you to get away from Marseille. My mom disagrees, she wants me back. Zachary, I talked to your mom about it. She agreed. I don't know what she told you, but I talked to her and she agreed. Not because she doesn't want you, but because she realizes she can't take care of you. - She wants what's best for... - Fine, fine. - Zachary. - I got it. What did you get? She agreed, she doesn't want me anymore. She realizes it's impossible. The goal is to help you. You need to build something and stop hanging out with your buddies in the hood. Every report that I get says the same thing. If we don't get you out of there, if we don't move you, you'll fall back into the same patterns. Do you understand? It's a temporary measure, for a few months. Take a moment to yourself. I don't know. I'm dreaming. It's just for a few months. We're trying to give you a second chance. - I don't even know where Toulon is. - Toulon is very close, Zach. - You don't get it, Soraya. - What is it I don't get? Calm down. Getting angry won't help. - Drop me off at home. - You know I can't. I won't go. Zach, listen to me, please. - Drop me off. - Listen to me first. - Stop doing that. Stop being angry at me. - Take your arm away. Drop me off. - You're hitting me now? - Drop me off, please. - Close it, please. - Slow down! Seriously? - Let go of me! - Slow down. Let go of me! What the hell are you doing? Let go of me, for fuck's sake! Zach! Zach! Let me through. Your caseworker called. - What? - All good? All good what? Everything's fine? Did you hear what I said? You get it? She called me. I don't get it. - You heard me. - It's like I'm a toy. I don't understand. What's the problem? Mom, don't start playing with me. I'm on edge. I'm pissed off. So pissed off. About what? - Really? - Yeah. That's nice. You think it's normal for me to go to Toulon. And you gave them the go ahead. Wait. Do you think it's normal for your unemployed mom to... I can't afford to have you. - Can't you understand I can't manage? - Lies. - The judge said no. - Why are you lying? It's not the judge, it's you, Mom. - You're lying. - I'm not lying, I can't take you back. Stop saying that! Stop lying! Stop lying! Enough! Hey! - What do you want? - Don't break the fridge, man. - Stop showing off. - Shut up. - Stop it. Both of you! - Shut up! - Don't touch me. - Stop it! You shut up. - Say it again and I'll fuck you up. - Enough. - Get out. - I'll kill you. Shut up! I'll slit your throat. What are you going to do? You can't respect your mom, but you want to fuck me up? - Get the fuck out. - It's fine, I'll talk to him. Better watch out. Watch out for what? Come on, show me. Fucking stop already. Oh. Can't you stop? Don't you understand? I can't afford it anymore. - I can't deal with your bullshit. - I get it. - You get what? - I'm used to living like a bum. The cops will keep showing up because of your bullshit. You need to go back. You need to go back. You need to leave before the cops show up. You're pushing it. Can I count on you? Don't ruin everything when you just go out. Can I count on you? I'm talking to you. Be careful. I love you, Zach. I'm so pissed off. Screw it, right? That's it. I can't feel anything anymore. I'm... I don't know. And that guy. I don't even know him, and he hit me. Who? - Who? - The guy I mentioned, the one at home. But on the Quran, you know, we'll take care of him when the time is right. Don't talk to him. Ignore him, don't talk to him. We'll get him. Whenever I follow people who want to set me straight, I end up on the streets. Fuck that place. Who cares? - Yeah. - I got nobody left. You're the only one. You know what we need, Ryad? A little house just for you and me. - Yeah. - We'd be set. Free to do whatever we want. We need to get out of the hood. Find money outside the hood. I'll find some, don't worry. I'll find some. I swear I will. I swear. It's for you. What's up, ugly? - I came to talk to you. - What do you want? Not here. Why not here? I don't want to talk here. Why not talk here instead of there? I dunno. Can't you see your girlfriends are listening? I want to talk to you. What's the matter with you? Ashamed? He likes her. What's going on? I need money. What's going on? I ran away from the home, I'm in deep shit. I don't even know where to sleep tonight. You could have cleaned up a bit. Who is he? - Who is he? - He's a friend. What are you doing here? - What? - What are you both doing here? I told you. - He needs a place to crash. - You didn't tell me. I shouldn't bother you. Why? What's up? What? She's my friend. You're fucking with me. I leave work... and now you want to leave? You freak out? Stay. Fine then, I'll stay for you if you want. I see weird people. - Let him go. - Ignore him. And you, shut up. I want you to make him leave. Why? - On the Quran... - He's staying. Don't swear on the Quran. - Don't swear on the Quran. - Excuse me? Do you believe in God? Do you pray? You don't do anything, you're sick. - Of course I believe in God. - You live in sin. Who are you to judge me? I believe in God. I'm a Muslim woman. For starters, you're a Muslim guy, for fuck's sake. A woman? You've got a dick. You heard him? I know, he's like that. He has no manners? - You boss people around? - Zelda. - I don't know. - You don't make people feel at ease. It's not my job. You're the one making me uneasy. Why invite people over? I wasn't expecting anyone. You're arguing for no reason. It's fine. It's true, I killed the vibe. I'm sorry. What is she doing? - What's up with him? - He's shocked. - Hard drugs. - What's wrong? Hard drugs. You're crazy. Mind your own business. I say that for you, I don't want you to die. Seriously. How can you stay with people like that? She's my friend. I don't get it. She's a tranny, a drug addict. That's a lot. Does she hustle too? Don't tell me people are willing to pay for this. Don't tell me people are willing to pay for this. Some guys like it better. Come on! I swear. Even drug lords and stuff. I swear I'm not lying. People like you. - They love her. - You want to get arrested? No. I swear, I know people. Zelda, are you sleeping? She's passed out. Super high. I'm sorry, but I find it shocking. Really shocking. Why? I don't know. A guy doing that. In the ass. I don't know. You know, when... When you have no way out in life, you'll do anything. She was there for me when I needed it. She's like a mother to me. She got me out of everything. She took me in when I was homeless. You were homeless? Really? Why? I didn't get along with my mom anymore. She put me in homes. Really? What about you? Your turn to talk to me. I just got out of jail. What did you do? Robberies. Armed robbery, gang mugging, all kinds of mugging. Purse snatching. A little bit of everything. Where are you going? Going to steal my hash again? Leave my little bunny next to us, I'm scared of the dark. - Really? - I swear. I'm actually scared of the dark. - What's wrong? - I'm over it. What did I tell you? - You're over what? - I don't want to see him when I wake up. If he wants to stay, he has to participate in rent. We can't split the room between us two and host people. From now on, you'll pay to stay. Faggot. We're collecting dust. We're collecting dust. I'm collecting dust. Again? I swear, he ignored me... I started doing crazy stuff. We're standing like whores. I'm mad as hell. - Yeah? - How's it going? Good, and you? What are you looking for? I'm just driving around. - You're just driving around? - Yeah. How much is it? You don't want anything, but you ask for a price? Just to know. Fifty for sex, 30 for a blow job. All right. No shame. What did he want? A credit. Exactly. No credit, just bust our balls. - Right? - He's just looking. I knew people like that. They bust your balls then leave. Yeah, right. He's looking for cheaper. That bitch undercharges everything. Hey! Come on, cousin. - Join us. There's three of us. - I don't do that. I see you every day. Wanna go for a ride? We'll take care of you. - Meaning? - Guess. You don't want to work for us. With you, definitely not. What's your price? Stop talking to him. What's your price? We're talking business. - Answer him. - You're eager. There's money to be made. What kind of money are you talking about? - Tell me your price. - A solid 100 euros. What? - Too good for us? - It's a joke? - One hundred euros. - One hundred euros is something. - Come on. - One hundred euros for the three of you? - How much do you want? - Forget it. - How much? - Two hundred. - Two hundred for three, don't diss. - Two fifty. It's a lot. Two fifty is a stiff price. Two fifty or nothing. All right, we'll give you 250. I got it, don't worry. We're going to have fun tonight. Bye. Doing it again? Coming or not? Can you come with me? Are you crazy? What do mean? There's three of them. I've never done that. You're leaving me on my own? You'll let me leave with three strangers? What if something happens? Come with me, please. - We'll bring her back. - Yeah. All set? Where's the money? The money's here. We don't give out change. It's 100 or nothing. If you want to leave, go. Stop showing off, put it in your pocket. You're a virgin. - Who's first? - Me. Bastard. Motherfucker. Good luck to you. Why close the door? Why are you talking? Fine. Let's stop talking. Move over there. Yeah. I don't know who he thinks he is. He closes the door. Let it go. Come on. Let me go second, or I'll fuck you up. Fine, you go then. He must be fucking her up. Come on. Wow. - He's a killer. - So crazy. You're a local celebrity now. He's nuts. He cracks me up. He's such a perv. So? Awesome. Holy shit. That was something. Straight up. You can't stop once you've started. Did you pound her or what? Upwards, downwards, sideways. - Losing his virginity. - He's having fun. For real. I fronted him the money. - You're laughing, but I'm relaxed. - Yeah. - What are you looking at? - It's fine. All good. Stop talking or I'll fuck you up. You're pissed, huh? Want to trade places with her? Come on in, I'll fuck you in the ass. Asshole. You're talking to me? I'll fuck you up, little faggot. Take it easy. Take it easy. Take it easy. Show's over. Take it easy. What did you do? How did you fuck her? Okay. So sadistic of you. See? It was quick. - I did it quickly. - Don't rub it in. Don't touch me. You touched a bunch of guys. Little sis. Come here. - What are you doing? - Nothing. Did the cops stop by the house? - No, only your caseworker. - Yeah? Is Mom freaking out? Can you come with me so Mom will let me in? I'm talking to you. What's the stuff people are talking about? What stuff? That you're living with a whore. You're young, stop talking shit. Who said that? I'm not that young. - Who said that? - Everybody. Will you come with me? Come with me. Give it back to her. It's mine. Lend it to her, then come back. Mom. Zach's here. Mister stubborn. Happy birthday. I didn't forget about you. - What is it? - Even if I'm stubborn. Open it, check it out. - What is it? - Open it. Wow. They cost me 300 euros. - I swear. - You paid? Three hundred euros. How did you pay for it? - There's a warranty. - Fine, but how did you get it? - That's not the answer. - You have the warranty, don't start. I wasn't asking you about the warranty. Stop asking questions. He's still here? What a pain in the ass. Don't start arguing. You don't know what he did for us when you were screwing around. He was there for me. But I can help you now, Mom. Stop it. You can't find a job? I looked but couldn't find one. Look what he gave me. That kid is crazy. I swear. - Nice, no? - Yeah. - Right? They look good on me. - Nice. You bet. Give me a kiss. How cute. My mom is the prettiest. You're really crazy. You cry every day and say, "He drives me crazy." It's true, but... He got you sunglasses. Where did he get them? Where does the money come from? I've had it, Mom. I don't know what he's looking for. - The way he looks at me. - What? Tell this son of a bitch to go fuck himself. Peekaboo! Whose kid is this? - What? - Who is he? That's his son. - He has a son? - Yeah. Think it's normal for your mom to bang youngsters? That's her life, not ours. She does what she wants. Right? Show me. - What? - Look, his son. Here. Stop, don't do this. You shouldn't be doing that. Come here. Come here, sweetie. There you go. Peekaboo! Peekaboo! He's mean. Mean! Cheba Kheira. Everybody tells me I look like her. Everyone. With the makeup and all, I look like her. Even more when I was blonde. I was platinum blonde. I'd love if you brought me clients. But we need an agreement together. For now, I have nothing. - I already have to pay my rent. - I know. I can see that. I'm not talking about right now. But later on, if you bring me clients and I have money... - Sure. - Yeah? So I'd look after you? Why not? If you're here... - Do you need money right now? - Honestly, yeah. Even so... - Zach! - I'll be right back. - Can I sit down? - Sure. - What's going on? - And the money? The Bulgarian hookers beat her up. Three whores from Sakakini. Three Bulgarians. Forget about it. These girls are tough. They fucked you up. Why go there? There's more money to be made. It's dead here. They stole my purse. Wasn't our money in the bag? Stand up. Wasn't our money in there? Yes, our money was in there. I worked all day. Where were you? I'll go right now. - What are you gonna do? - I'll go with you. The blonde was in on it. - The blonde. - Her? - Yeah. - Yeah. She was in on it. The two fat ones are gone, but I recognize the blonde one. Okay. Get lost, I'll go alone. - Alone? Are you nuts? - Don't worry. Look what I got. - Don't worry. - You won't go alone. I'll do it, get lost. I'll stay here. - Hi, need anything? - Come with me. - I have no money. - Come here. - You stole money from that girl. - Let go of me. Let go of me. You stole from the tranny. - I didn't do anything. - Don't touch me. That stuff is mine, okay? It's my money. Go fuck your grandma. Come here. - Come here. - What do you want? - Who the fuck are you? - I said stop. - What do you want? - Come here. Hey! Hey! - Drop your knife. - Give me my money. - Drop it. - Have my money? - Hey. - Hand it to me. Motherfucker. Let go of me! No! - Stay here. - Let go of me! Let go of me. Can't you see they're killing him? Wait! How much money do I owe you? - What's up? - What did you do now? - Dracula. - What did you do? Bulgarian pimps beat me up. - Well... - They did this to me. Why were you hanging out with pimps? What did you do? - I have hookers now. - What hookers? At the Rotonde. You... They went there and got mugged. I went to get my money back and they jumped me. Why didn't you go to the home like I told you? There's so much money to be made there. Weren't you supposed to drop him off? I did, he went rogue. Seeing him just now. Anyway, I made it, but there's a big problem. I have a problem. I need a gun and your help. Let me sit down. Get up. What Bulgarians? Where do they live? They live on Sakakini, they stay there. We're going to fuck them up. Show me. Those motherfuckers. I need a gun. I thought you'd go to jail and come back a bit wiser, but not at all. - Even dumber. - Even dumber than before. I grew up with you. I'm not a kid anymore. Your mom doesn't want to see you anymore, there must be a problem. Don't mention my mom. I'm going to start by talking about your mom. You don't know what's going on at home, Mehdi. That's all I'm saying. Honestly, I'm sick and tired of you. - I don't know what to tell you. - Growing up, you were like my family. I didn't say otherwise. I like you, I appreciate you, but you keep fucking up. - I know. - At some point, figure your own shit out. I'm not your dad. I can't be behind you your whole life. I have a kid, I have a life. Seriously. You're a big shot in the hood. You dissed me last time, we should respect each other. What's in it for me? Fifty-fifty. Fifty-fifty. You charge 50 euros, we get 25 euros each. What's fifty-fifty? Five hundred euros a day. Don't think about what you'll make. - Five hundred euros a day. - You seem confident. Know how much 500 a day is? Fifteen thousand at the end of each month. I don't want to know. I'll give you 500 a day. Will you help me or not? All right, let's go. - Get out! - All right. - Open up. - Fucking Bulgarians. Open up or I'll blow your window. Open the door! Hey! - Easy. - You're dead. You're dead! See this turf? It's ours now. Drive, we'll talk. Drive now! Fifty for a blow job, 70 for a blow job and a wank. A good deal. Four hundred and fifty. Damn! - I made less. - How much? - Three hundred? - No. - Two-fifty? - No. - Three-fifty? - Yeah. Hey! Hey there! Come see how much she made! As if I had worked for a month. You look nice. She's beautiful, she's been in the bathroom doing God knows what. Stop! - Take a hike. - No, you. She didn't make anything today, she didn't even work. I stayed with you and you complain? Let's play! We can fix it. The kids in my hood are green with envy. They were all so jealous, by Allah! They changed their mind They're staring I'm happy with my little back rest.

In love with her? She's a hooker. Then it means you don't mind. I don't give a shit, she's a hooker. Right, guys? Do I get it for free? If she says it's free, then it is. Stop bugging me. She'll do it for free. What are you doing? Let go of me! I told you to let go of me! Got it? What's up with your pal? You let him touch my ass? I'm talking to you. I'm not his bitch. You don't say anything? Are you nuts? Your friend is feeling me up and nothing? I'm out of here. Give me my stuff. Tell her to go with me. Tell her. She's banged hundreds of guys but is making a scene about me. What the hell? - She doesn't want to. - It's her job. She's a hooker. - Should I pay her? - She works. - She doesn't want to. - I'll pay her. She picks her clients, bro. What do you mean, "she picks"? She's a hooker working for you. She works for me but fucks whoever she wants. Working means any client. - Here's 50 euros. - She said no. You don't want me to. Here's the deal. - Stop staying... - Listen to me. Do you owe my brother? Didn't we help you with your girls? I don't have the money tonight. - But I'll... - Don't have it? What's this? Give me my brother's money. - Shut up. - I don't care. Stay out of this, guys. Come on, he's your friend. Ryad, chill out! - Stop meddling. I don't care! - He's your friend. You don't know anything. I've known him since childhood. He's making a scene for a hooker. What's his deal? I'd give an arm for him. Don't touch me. Did you buy cigarettes? I'm almost out. Want some? Assia, want some? Later, yeah. Hayet! Thanks, I'm hungry. Eat then. - Hey. - How's it going? - Good. - How much? - Fifty for a blow job and 70 for sex. - Get in. You love her, don't you? Wow. Come on, fess up. It looks serious. Come on. Tell me you're in love with her. Piss off or I'll smack you. - Tell me you love her. - Go. I don't. Liar. Seen Shéra? - What? - Seen Shéhérazade? No. Haven't seen her for hours. Did the Bulgarians bug you? - No, they didn't. - No? No. Why? I don't know. She's not picking up. There were no issues? Nothing? No. Why are you asking? Something happened. Something is off. You're worried. She'll be back, don't worry. - But... - You were here all day, nobody bugged you? Nobody. - Hello. - Hello. Has my friend Shéhérazade Boubekeur been admitted here? I'd have to check, miss. Do you mind running a search? Visiting hours are over anyway. - Can you check? - To see if she's all right. - I can't tell you, she's getting checked. - I don't give a shit. Hey. Calm down. It's 6:00, we're all tired. Wait outside, we'll come see you. - What does she have? - Okay? - Miss. Miss! - I can't wait, it's been half an hour. - Calm down. - I asked nicely, you looked down on me. Stop talking to me. - I'll go see... - Calm down. Please, miss. - We'll call security. - Do it. Please calm down. We'll check the file. Show me. Who did this to you? Who was it? Let's split, Shéra. Come, Shéra. Let's get out of here. I'll give you your shoes. Ryad filmed with his camera. They can't show the video. Ryad did this to you? Explain, I don't understand. Ryad did this to you? I don't understand what you're saying. My parents don't know I do that. My parents don't know what I do. Don't worry, they'll never know. - What are you doing? - Picking up my girl. Sit down. - Sit down, Shéhérazade. - No, she needs to go. Listen, the thing is... Stop pushing her, she's hurting. Let's have her lie down. Shéhérazade. I know. There you go. What are you going to do? No need to cover her, I'm taking her home. Tell me what's going on with her. I'll know if I can take her home or not. Give me a minute. Can you wait outside? I just need to... Shéra. Should I wait outside? You won't tell me what happened? I don't have any context. I don't know how it happened. - I don't know who... - What's up with her? She has hematomas... What's that? I don't understand. Talk plainly, you're pissing me off. She has huge bruises on her arms. She was hit in the face. I think she has a broken tooth. You don't want to tell me what happened, then? I don't know everything that happened, okay? I think she'll tell you about it later. But she's been attacked, she needs to file a complaint. What the hell do you... I want to know what happened, okay? You don't want to tell me? Do you want to tell me or not? If you don't, then just leave. What's so hard to understand? - Do you get it or not? - There are things I can't tell you. Then get out the way, bye. Get out! Calm down! Stop it. I'm gonna fuck you up! Let go of me! Don't touch me! What's going on? Fuck off! What's going on? Come here! I told you to stop. Stop it. Stop or I'll hit you. Stop. What did he do? He raped my girl. I'll kill him. - He's losing it. We saw his girl and left. - What did you do? - Shut up. - We left. Liar! He raped her! Faggot! - It was wrong! - Shut up! - I'll fuck him up. Talk to him! - Shut up. Let him speak. What did you do? Listen, we went to see his girl and see him. The rest doesn't matter. Why did you go see his girl? - Speak up! - He's lying! He's lying to you. She's not even his girlfriend anyway. She's a hooker. She's a hooker. She's a hooker, she gets paid. I went to see her. Just like everybody else. Then I left, that's it. She's a hooker. She's a hooker, he's lying to you. - What are you doing? Calm down. - I'll kill you. - I'm going to kill you, Ryad. - You assholes. You come over and stir shit up. What shit? He dared touch her. - It's normal. - Shut the fuck up, asshole. - I'm sorry, Mehdi. - Why do you apologize? You should be apologizing to this asshole, bro. - You should apologize to him. - I'm sorry, bro. - Okay, tell me. Is she a hooker or not? - She's not. She's a hooker, Mehdi. I swear it on the Quran, I wouldn't lie. She's a hooker. You come here to stir shit up for a hooker. Have you lost your mind, Zach? They fucked a whore, shot their loads. And you make a scene? Are you in love with her? Answer me. Tell me. I don't know, bro. You've got that look of yours. - Let me go. - You show up ready to stab my bro. You think that's life? Get the hell out. - Let go of me. - Let him go. Get out! Let go of me! Let go of me! - Let him go. - Get out. - Asshole. - What a nutcase. Of all the whores, you chose his? - Get the fuck out, asshole! - Fine! - Look. - Watch what? - Don't come back. - Start your bike. I'm leaving. Go fuck... Get the fuck out! Don't worry. Don't think about it. Get some sleep. All right? Thanks. - Are you all right? - Yeah. Scram. Get lost. This way! This way! Piss off! It's moving! It's moving! Zach is here! He's got a gun! Move aside! He's packing! Kill him! Motherfucker! Bastard! Son of a bitch! Bastard! We'll kill you! Shéra! Shéra. I've been looking for you everywhere. Let's go. Leave me alone, please. I'm here for you, I swear. It's too late now. - You should have been there then. - I shot him. I'm in trouble. I don't know if he's dead. I need you. And I didn't need you? - Didn't I need you? - I handled it. Handled what? - We can go back. - Go back alone. - Come with me. - No. - The two of us. Like before. - No. It will never be the same. Just like before. They'll leave us alone. - You shouldn't be here. Get out. - Hang on. - No, now. - Shéra, come. - Come. - Get lost. - Get lost. - You shouldn't be here. - I'll be outside. - Leave! - Get out, please. - Fine. I got it! It's not fine. Why don't you go see her? Try and talk to her. Why should I do that? Give it a shot. If you can help me, help me. You'll get help your whole life. I never told you, but you never acted like a man. It's up to me to solve your problems? Seriously? I don't have enough problems of my own? You're such a bitch. I'm not a bitch. Life sucks, can't you see it? I hustle every day for them. To feed my son, to make ends meet. - But... - And you can't even man up? - I defended her, I told you. - But not like that. That's the streets. I'm talking about... something more practical. Do something. This story is not over. I can't do anything, I'm no snitch. "No snitch." What will I tell that shitty lawyer? You know everything. You just have to say... Just talk about your life. What you went through. All you have to do is tell the truth. Be there for her. You want to man up, man up all the way. If I tell everything, I'll go to jail. That's a possibility. You act badly, then complain you might go to jail. I don't understand how your brain works. Yeah. I don't understand how it works. I can't even think anymore. I don't know. Put yourself in her shoes. Just put yourself in her shoes. I don't know. She went through something crazy. She sells her body every day. Life shook her up. It's shocking for a woman. You think it's easy? All you saw was the money. "Money is great!" It's true. You don't see everything she does. The sacrifice she makes. And now... this? Think about it if you really want her back. Then go ahead. - Where do I go? - You'll know what to do. - It's logical. - Where do I go, to court? If I go, my mom will be there, everyone. Man up. The bedrooms. Shower and toilets are over there. The supervisors' offices. This is your room. This one here? You don't like it? - Sleep, it's late. - I'll sleep with them? Come on, get in the room. - Sleep. - They're staying? I'll take you down, Eden. That's your room. - Your stuff. - Can I smoke? You can't. It's a kid's room. Take it easy. Come on, Eden. Get in bed. Get in your bed. - You hungry? - No. Sure? I'll turn the light off. All right. See you tomorrow. Zach! Yeah? Your uncle is downstairs. - Come. - What uncle? Your uncle is here. You know him? So? - Do you know him? - I don't. - You don't know him? - Zach. - Zach. - He said he doesn't know you. Zach! Hey! Don't stay here. He doesn't know you. What? I'm his uncle. He said he doesn't know you. You can't stay. Don't stay here. - He's my nephew. - He doesn't know you. Don't come back. Look at me. Are you all right? Okay. Relax, it's just an investigation. The judge will gather all the information you give them. They'll put them together to know the truth. You must say the right thing. Your mom is here. - Hello. - Hello. - I leave you to it. Make it quick. - Thank you. What's going on? What's all this about? You're not going to do that for this girl. You'll testify against your friends? - They're not anymore. - You'll testify against them? It's not my problem. They made some mistakes. They have to face them. You're going to snitch? I'm not snitching, he did that on his own. It's his fault. I didn't force him, I didn't threaten him to rape my girl. Cut the crap. You can't testify against them for a whore. You've only known her for two months. Do you realize what it will do to us? You can't do that, we're no snitches. I'm not a snitch. - I'm not a snitch. - Cut the crap. Listen to me. Listen to me, son. We'll soon be all together. Look. For real? Yeah. See? I finally found a job. I'll ask for a bigger place. You'll have a beautiful bedroom. With a balcony and all. - And I'll come back. - Of course, I did this to get you back. That's the only reason. But... Listen to me, son. Don't snitch, don't say anything. Don't testify against them. Tell the judge you've got nothing to say. You had nothing to do with it. It's not you. - I didn't do anything. - Exactly. All right. I have to get back to work. I can't be late. I'm counting on you. Be careful. Zach. Zach! - Hello. - Hello, Miss Boubekeur. Please sit here. - Hello. - Hello. Go ahead. Hello, Mr. Arrouche. - Please sit... - Shéra. - ...here. Hello. - Hello. Shéra. Hello, Mr. Mahres. Please sit in the center. I've called for this hearing to get to the bottom of the contradicting statements made in this case. Miss Boubekeur, I'll bring up some of your statements. I'd like you to clarify the facts as you remember them. You claim to have been raped, allegedly by three people whom you've identified and that are present today. Is that correct? Yes. What happened? Ryad, Cheyenne, and Jugurtha pulled over. They were in the car. Yes. They told me to get in to go see Zach. They told you to get in to go see Zach. Zach is Mr. Arrouche sitting behind you? Okay. And then? I got in. You accepted to get in. Not right away, but I did. - Not right away? What did you say? - I said no. - Excuse me? - No. You said no at first. They insisted. - Who was talking to you? - Ryad. Ryad. So, Mr. Mahres. You then voluntarily got into the vehicle. Miss, if I go back to your statement, you mentioned, and that's why we need clarification, "Yes, he did the thing." Can you please describe what you mean by "the thing"? He got undressed. He got undressed, okay. He saw I didn't want to do it and was trying to get out. - I don't understand. - I wanted to get out of the car. Yes. He held me. He flipped me over. And I hit my chin on... on the door. That's the injury we can still see? All right. And then? He took off my skirt. My panties. Yes. And he penetrated me. Mr. Mahres, do you confirm that after getting into the car you were in, you then had sexual intercourse with Miss Boubekeur, and that she resisted, struggled, and shouted? No. - No? - No. All right, can you please explain what you think happened that day? - That day? - Yes. I'll explain. I was with my friends. My friend was driving. We were driving around Marseille. We saw her. We stopped by. Honestly, we know she's a prostitute from the... That place, I don't know the name. We asked her what she was doing. Invited her in. It's true she said no at first, that much is true. She said no, we talked her into it. "You're not doing anything. Come along." She got in. We left. We stopped somewhere, and then... Since we were stopped and drinking a bit... We drank some alcohol and were a bit drunk. I was honestly offering her 50 euros to... For sex. That's it. I gave her the 50 euros, we did what we had to do. And that's it. "We did what we had to do." What does that mean? We did... We... I don't know. We fucked, if you prefer. Watch your language. You know perfectly well what we did. - You want me to say it. - I'm trying to understand how we go from "I gave her 50 euros" to "We did what we had to do." What happened? I gave her 50 euros, we had sexual intercourse. Describe it. What did Miss Boubekeur do and what did you do? Well, we... We had sex. I got that part. How did it go? How did it go? You want to know the positions? I would like some details to understand what made you think she agreed to it when she said she didn't. It wasn't rape, she gave consent. After sex, she left like... Normally. She had no marks on her. I don't know what that is. She's accusing us when I didn't do anything. Okay, according to you, she was consenting. For me, yes. What did she say when you offered her the 50 euros? - She took them. - Yes. Did she say something? She asked me not to tell anyone. - She asked you to keep it a secret. - Yes. - Why would she do that? - Considering I'm in court and seeing my childhood friend with her, I think she was afraid Zach would find out. - But you say... - Come on, I'm not just out to get you. I'm not crazy, we were tight. Mr. Arrouche, please only speak to me. And only when asked. Your Honor, she's a prostitute. She's out on the streets until midnight or 1:00 a.m. A lot of things can happen to her in the same night, especially in Marseille. - I didn't do this to her. - Listen. I didn't do anything to her. I was hanging out with my friends, we were drinking. I decided to treat myself. Maybe that's not right, maybe I'm... I'm not proud of it. I'm not proud to tell you I paid 50 euros to "fuck a whore," forgive my language. I swear I didn't do anything to her. All right. We need to clarify something regarding the 50 euros. Were you soliciting for prostitution when they saw you on Sakakini Boulevard? Can you confirm that? - No. - No. So... I'll rephrase my question. Let me remind you this is a criminal investigation, you're in front of a judge, you must tell the truth. Do you... regularly solicit for the purpose of prostitution near Labadie Square? Yes. - Excuse me? - Yes. Yes? You sometimes find yourself on Labadie Square to offer your services as a prostitute? - Yes. - Yes? That day, on August 10th, when you got into the car occupied by Mr. Mahres, Mr. Gambino, and Mr. Benkadar, where you indeed waiting for a client for prostitution? All right. Did you agree to have sex for money with at least one of them when you got into the car? - No. - No. - You maintain your statement. - Yes. Mr. Zachary Arrouche. You asked to appear in regards to this case. I'm all ears. Why do you want to testify? To tell you that... if my friends... my former friends did that... it's to get revenge on me. Well. "To get revenge." Could you explain? What kind of vengeance? Why get revenge on you? It's because... I owed them money for something and I didn't pay them back. All right. What was this money about? Ryad's brother helped me get the streets back. "Get the streets back." Could you elaborate on what that means? That's where the hookers work. Why did you owe money? He had helped me to get rid of the previous pimps. Did you write it down? All right. So, what you're telling us is that you and Mr. Mahres' brother are engaging in... In what? You're telling us you're putting women on the streets. That's not the issue. - It is. - The issue is they raped... Indeed. Thank you for explaining. I don't know if you've heard, but procuring is a crime, sir. You're saying you engage in procuring, that's what you're saying? Yeah. Court clerk, please write that Mr. Arrouche admits to getting money from prostitutes since he's their pimp. In your activities as a pimp, what happened? So far, I fail to understand how raping Miss Boubekeur would be revenge against you. Because I don't care about the other hookers. They knew she was my girl. "They knew she was your girl." What do you mean by "girl"? Your partner or a girl that works like the others? A girl that works like the others. - Shut the fuck up, asshole. - I didn't ask you a question. She's a whore. I did everything for you, you rat. - You're doing this for a woman? - Explain to your client that if he keeps interrupting, he'll be removed. All right. She worked like the others, but she's my girl. - Your girl. - We split the money, but she's my girl. - She's your girl. - Yeah. Out of revenge, the three accused would have raped Miss Boubekeur to get to you. Yes. If it wasn't true, I wouldn't say it is. But I know it is. I care about her. And I love her. A new guy! Snitch! We'll get you in the hallway. Little rat! You snitched on Ryad! Here he comes. Here he comes. Take it easy. He's lost. - Someone looking for trouble? - What's up with him? Want to fight? Who wants to fight? You spoke up. Come on, guys. Leave him alone. He just got here. Give me the ball. You're looking for trouble? What should I do to you? I'm going to whip him. Whip what? Play ball or I'll make you eat it. Check out what we do to snitches. Shut the fuck up. We'll do it slowly. Go ahead. Ma'am. I'm not feeling well. Can you leave it open? I can't leave the door open. - You're not well? - Not really. I'll finish my rounds and come back. Promise. Snitch! Motherfucker. Snitch! We'll fuck you up. We'll show you what we do to snitches. You're handsome. Be careful. Let's go. Get him! You snitch! Motherfucker. A lot of people are mad at me. I'm not welcome. I hope you're all right. I hope one day... I'll see you again. I hope we'll start from scratch. Leaving the bad behind. And that... we'll have a life like normal people. Do it right! Faster! Do it faster! Keep going! Again? Yeah. Should I help you? Do it too. Hi! - How are you? - Good and you? Good. I'm in shock. I'm in shock. What are you doing here? I thought you forgot about me. - What happened to your eye? - Nothing, it's fucked. But I have the other one. It's weird to see you. I'm happy. I'm feeling all weird, you know. Feels like I might be dreaming. So? - What are you up to? - I'm training as a baker. For real? Look what I brought. Holy shit! - You like it, right? - Yeah. They'll catch me. Shit. I made a mess. - You forgot how to eat? - You know... Ryad got a year. - Yeah? - Yeah. - It's a good thing, right? - Totally, that mofo. I got a heavier sentence for shooting him. Once I'm done with that, that's it. I'm free. Everything will go back to normal. I just need to get out of here. I'm dreaming. I could eat you. I can't even climb or anything. - Yeah. - You're so handsome. I swear. You're so beautiful. Zachary? She's busting my balls, she'll drive me crazy. Get out of here, Zach. Yeah. I will. - Zachary, hurry up. - Go. You're not done. Take care of yourself. Stay here. Come on. Get out of here, Zach. I'll wait for you. Subtitle translation by Audrey Prieur-Drevon
