What's the progress? The cause of death in Olivia's case is CDI Combined Drug Intoxication After taking a vaccine shot, We mustn't take painkillers. as it could prove fatal. Similarly, in Olivia's case we found 2 drugs in her body; One of which is LSD. which they spiked her juice with. What's the other drug? We don't know yet. We've sent samples to a special lab. We can't be certain until the reports are back So for now, It's a mystery drug. Yashoda! Your first trimester report is here. Your baby is healthy So, will you leave tomorrow? Did you hear me?

The Doctor's calling you Hi Doctor - Hi Rishi How are you? - I'm good & this is the report Shiv Reddy's cause of death? - Asphyxiation He died due to lack of oxygen. Really? Doctor! Wasn't it an explosion? No, No. The fire was caused by an airbag malfunction. Nothing else. I can't believe it... Isn't it strange? That life-saving airbags can cause death? Have airbag malfunctions caused deaths before? 24 such cases have been reported worldwide. That's the only data we have now. That's what google says. Ok -Thanks Doctor Shiv Reddy's autopsy report, Sir. Airbag malfunction, Sir. So... That is it Rishi. Have a seat Thank you, Sir I think we have an open and shut case. We can inform the press. What do you say? Sir, But... I think we should take an expert opinion before we close the case. Shiv Reddy is an influential man So that people can't point fingers at our Department. Expert opinion, huh? Have someone in mind? -Yes Sir Mr. Vasudev. You mean the Police Academy trainer? - Yes, Sir. Mental fitness coach Sounds good to me. I think you should go ahead. Just keep me posted - Thank you, Sir. Jai Hind, Sir - Jai Hind! Look...! You can't stick those 'bindis' up wherever you like. You are? - Sudha! I'm a warden here. Madhu Ma'am told me that all of this is mine. My mirror and my 'bindi'. What's your problem? - I don't want to argue with you. Wear this... And get ready. It's time for your scan. You must eat on time, do yoga on time, and sleep on time. Everything must happen on time. You can't wander around as you like. Or else... Madhu ma'am will not spare you What're you looking at? Scan room... Yeah, I know. Come in. Lie down. Lay down on the bed. Unbutton it. What? I want a girl... The scan will determine if it's a boy or a girl That's not it... I want a Lady Doctor How does the gender matter? A Doctor's a Doctor. is it ok to close eyes during scanning? How do I scan with my eyes closed? No... May I close my eyes? Your call My heart is pounding It's not your heartbeat It's your baby's Really? Can I see? - No It's my baby, after all. Why can't I? Hmm - They'll take it away at birth anyway What? The baby's reflection in your glasses... I saw it! Thanks for showing my baby, Doctor. We complete your family! Yashoda. Whatever! - Yashoda Nice name. My name is Teju! She's new here. She'll be in your batch henceforth. Teju... 5th month. Leela... 7th month Kajal... 6th month. Jenny... 5.5 Why isn't Sreeja here yet? Her Majesty doesn't come down unless summoned! No. Uh no Sudhamma! - Ptch What? What's the time? Aah... Lunchtime...! Eat! Wasting my time...! There's dal curry and sambar... But I eat curd rice first and the rest later Please pass the sauce Su... Hmm Are you crazy? Sauce with curd rice? Never tried it? Ewww... Here... Wanna try? Pass it to Jenny - Hey! How dare you ask Teju? The arrogance! Do you know who Teju is? - She is Zone 3's gang leader No one does anything here without her permission Su... She left... Hmph What should I do? Teju... Let her be \- Ptch.. No. Go to Zone 2 You'll find our storeroom Everything we need is stocked there Find me a cigarette pack from there. Hmm? You're still here? How do I get there? Uh.. There... -Hey Find it yourself, Go! We're not allowed in Zone 2.. - Let's see Who are you? You're not allowed here! - Nagu, I'll take it from here You go. OK. Look... This is a restricted zone... Only Doctors and Staff are allowed entry... You mustn't come here. I've come for my bag. I need... Don't worry about your bag Your bag is safe They'll return it when you leave I've never been away from my little sister since when we were kids I miss her Her dress is inside my bag I can't fall asleep without it Can't you help? Only patients are allowed here Patient? Who's the patient? Hey - Who's the patient? Do I look like a patient to you? - Shh You can't be loud here. Please understand. They won't return your bag no matter what you do. Come with me I'll take you to your room - My sister... Bag... We'll lose our jobs if somebody spots you here Come! OK. Rishi...! Sir! -Got something? Sir, meet Mr. Vasudev Hi Hello How are you Sir? - Good, Thank you Anything interesting? It's a planned murder. What?! Really? Didn't they die of asphyxiation? Yeah but... Come, let me explain. Hm. Three chemicals trigger the deployment of airbags... These two chemicals combine to emit nitrogen, which is dangerous.. So they add this third chemical, to diffuse the nitrogen That chemical is Silicon Dioxide But somebody has removed the third chemical from the airbags How are you so sure that somebody removed it? I mean... It could be a manufacturing defect Isn't it? Sir... If only one airbag was opened, it could've been a defect But all 6 airbags were open And neither of the 6 had the third chemical It seems... Purely intentional So to begin with... If we list out Shiv Reddy's potential rivals... We could but... They could be Arushi's as well... Just a thought Ah, No. Arushi is a nobody compared to Shiv Reddy I mean... After all, she's just a model If Shiv Reddy was their only target... He could've been killed on his way back from Goa two days ago And let's not forget She's the top contestant In the Miss India pageant Sir... With your permission... I'm thinking of investigating this case along with Mr. Vasudev Yeah Rishi, I think you can go ahead Hope you understand. Thanks a lot - Please do it secretively Yup, Sure - Thank you, Sir. She is so hot! Get back to work! Cool... Cool! Ram, Got any clue? On it bro. The last email she read could be from Eagle guy Eagle guy? Strange name Who could it be? I think a private detective Looks like he used to run background checks on products that Arushi used to endorse. Strange! Very ethical girl. Open the last email Sure Sir... There's a video attachment But password protected. Give me some time. Sir! -Yeah Rishi? Arushi's advertising contracts They get activated once she is crowned Miss India It's clear now It's a vengeance of nepotism. Ptch... Where's the proof? She's a top model in the Miss India pageantry Such offers from consumer brands are common Ram - Sir Please dig deep. Arushi... There's an unnamed substance in this 'Kraft' Fairness cream They haven't given an explanation for the same No clarity either... I don't think this is a genuine product. So, it's better that you don't sign the 'Kraft' Cream contract. Who's this 'Kraft?' Cleopatra needed these kind of techniques all those centuries ago But now... We have 'Kraft' cream! Cut it! Hey Cameraman! Can you... - Excuse me You are? Police. -Oh! What can I do for you, my dear Police? We need details of your product. I can't do that at short notice. Because.. Whatever it is... You need to email me about it Mr. Sonu... - Rishi Thanks for your time, Sonu. We'll mail you the details Come, let's go Switch off. Run a background check on him. I already have. Central Minister Giridhar is Sonu's father. The Central Drugs Standard Control has given clearance for their product. We can't do anything without solid evidence. Dead end. I don't believe in dead ends, boys There is an open window. Eagle guy. Look what's coming - 'Upma' or 'aapam?' Oh God...! Leela... This is good for your health A Kerala specialty. Whatever. This 'aapam' looks like a pregnant 'dosa'. Good joke. Eat I guess I'll just have the 'vada' for today. Sigh Hey Teju - Hmm I seem to have misplaced by Tab. Do you have it? What Tab? Oh, did she swallow the tab instead of the tablet ? Please give it back to me if you have it I can't get any work done without it. It contains everybody's prescription details... I don't understand... Are you my personal warden? Why do you come to me only when something's wrong? Why do I even bother with you? Eat! What happened? Why are you kicking? You want to be a football player? Quiet! - What happened? Is the baby kicking? Yeah - Ptch Don't be mischievous. Go back to sleep Shh Kids don't go to sleep if you shout at them Then? # [baby sounds] It's time to sleep... # The breeze is singing #the chorus for your lullaby... # It's time for the boogeyman... # Please go to sleep without making a sound... # My dear little sister... # You are my true gold... # I’ve resided on earth just for you… # You are my cute little flower.. # You are the moonlight in our home... # When I’m there with you.. # nothing can perturb you.. # I’ll fullfill the loss of mother in your life.. # That is the reason I’ve come to earth.. # This life of mine is not mine but yours... # Your smile in ecstasy is enough for me... Do you have a balm on you? Huh? For headaches Do you have one? Oh Oh ok. Give me a minute Here No thanks My headache's vanished as soon as I saw you You're the one who took the tab right? Of course. She picked a fight with me on my first day So I thought I'll have some fun Felt bad for her so I returned it -ptch You are becoming a troublemaker Just like Teju Rishi The door looks like it's not been opened for two days Break it! I'll go talk to the neighbours The food here was ordered two days back Seenu! - Sir The freezer's dimensions seem odd to me.. Check this. On it, Sir! Remove it Look at this 'Kraft' sample This is all we need. We'll find a clue once we run tests on it Altaf! - What's up? You've heard about Hollywood actress, Olivia's, murder case right? Yeah. According to her autopsy report... Her body contained traces of LSD... along with a mystery drug. What's the connection between that case and the sample I gave you? After running a test on.. the sample that you provided... I found traces of the same mystery drug. As he saw his mother, Yashoda, come running... What? As he saw his mother, Yashoda, come running... Yeah. As he saw his mother, Yashoda, come running... Thanks... You've given me a fantastic lead. Krishna ate all of the butter I'll perform a deeper analysis of this sample again... I threw it away and keep you updated. Yeah. Bye bro, bye. Good morning! Time for your checkup. Thanks for not telling Madhu ma'am that I was in Zone 2 yesterday. You're a good guy... It's OK. Are you married? No. Why not? But you're so handsome... Why...? The bindi suits you. So... You've been noticing if I've had my bindi on or not everyday? There's chocolate... You shouldn't be having too many chocolates. I am not too fond of them... I prefer peanut chikkis over chocolates. But only chocolates are available here. I won't tell Madhu ma'am that you've stolen chocolate from me. Yashoda! She's done for! You give me chocolates in a cigarette pack?! What're you looking at? You thought you were the only one who could bring me cigarettes? You'll soon find out... - Teju Cigarettes are harmful for the baby... What?! Is it my baby? The baby is for someone else... Why are you getting worked up... Did they offer you an extra amount for advising others or what? No, right? Tell me if they are. If not, why're you doing this? Shut up and leave. I know You're a mother after all I don't smoke for fun There's a reason for it I am an ugly reminder to my parents That they didn't have a son Come on... Can't a daughter do everything a son would've? So one of the things I picked up was smoking ... As my father was lamenting that a son would've helped clear our debts... I chanced upon this offer An offer no son could've taken up Hmph And that was it I lied to them that I was going abroad for work and came here instead You wanted to grow up like a man But I... was kept away from them all my life Why? I was born in a red light district My mom... was a prostitute in a Mumbai red light district She had me when she was just 14... And that's why... They'd sent me away to my village as soon as I was born All I got was some money from her every month.. and this ring... I don't even remember how she looked In order to get my mother... out of that place... I needed money That's why I'd.. agreed to be a... surrogate mother. Everyone here has their own story.. Forget about our stories... You want to know why she's here? Why? What?! Tell her. I'm crazy about iPhones. I'm here because I don't have the money for it. You really are crazy. You've agreed to be a surrogate for an iPhone?! - Oh please... Good morning! Can I watch the show 'Aaraneekumaa Nee Deepam' on this? Sorry... No TV serials are available. Some movies have been loaded into it. You can watch them. Why bother having a TV in a woman's room... when you can't watch daily serials? Chikki!! You remembered... Thanks. Are you married? No. I'll get married once I deliver the baby. I'm looking for a suitable boy. What kind of a man are you looking for? Hmm... The man I marry should... be able to find and rescue me if I'm ever lost somewhere... He should be able to notice what I'm wearing... if I have my bindi on or not and compliment me on the same.. Whenever I ask for something... he should take note of it... and bring them to me. And yeah... As a minimum requirement... He should at least be a Doctor. Check your blood pressure once... I can hear your heartbeat from here. Shahrukh Khan, Aamir Khan, Karan Johar.. Shilpa Shetty, Sunny Leone, There's a long list... Hmm... Actually... They've all become parents through surrogacy. This surrogacy method.. is like a boon to them. We needn't be surprised even if this business... goes online in a few years. Why are you all laughing? I'm just imagining how it would be if it was online. How would it be? Then we'd have to go to the client's house... conceive the baby there itself... Deliver the baby... and ask for a star rating. What happened? - Are you okay? Sudhamma! It'll be alright - Here, here... You guys wait here. You're not allowed inside. Kajal, be strong. Krishna, please stop with your games. Protect Kajal... You'll listen to this mother, won't you? hmm? Who're you talking to? my 'Kanayya'. The baby growing in my womb is God himself. Krishna! I come from a family of puppeteers. I've been listening to and preaching tales of Krishna all my life. so I believed that I would give birth to Krishna himself. After my wedding... the doctors told me that my husband is infertile. I was heartbroken... that I won't be able to give birth to my Krishna. I was devastated... And then I made peace with it. After that... my husband fell ill. So we came to the city. We took him to the hospital. The Doctors told us that he needs expensive treatment. And that's when I was given this opportunity. That's when I understood... that this was all a part of my Krishna's game. It really is, isn't it Yashoda? Even back then... Krishna was born in prison. And even now... this isn't too different from one. I only wish for one thing... According to the contract... I should hand over the baby, the moment it is born. Without even looking at it. But I need to have a look at my Krishna. Just once. I'll take him in my arms, kiss him, and then I'll give him to them. How's Kajal Ma'am? The baby... Kajal's baby... did not survive. It died two days back... And that's why... There was no fetal movement Poor Kajal had no idea I am telling you this because.. If something feels off, Inform the Doctors immediately. We have to remove the foetus immediately... to save Kajal's life. I am on duty. Sir! Hello. Yes, Rishi... Are you outside Sonu's house? -Yes, Sir. Any progress? We've been surveilling him since Altaf's death. But nothing suspicious. He's just a clown. Anwar's with you? Yes Sir.. OK Bye. We have new information. What is it Sir? We got a video call from the CBI... Rishi.. Rishi, are you there? Sir, we're under attack! Rishi.. Rishi! Anwar, duck! Anwar! Duck! Anwar! Anwar! Anwar! Anwar Good morning, ladies... Shall we learn some new 'asanas' today? Madam - Hmm Is Kajal's surgery over? We're worried. We removed the foetus.. and sent her home. But we wanted to meet Kajal... I've already told you... Don't keep any attachments. Including the baby in your womb. I hope you understand. Shall we, ladies? Come on! Let's start. Nothing makes sense, Yashoda.. Could she have even moved after a surgery like that? So how could Kajal travel back home? Yashoda? Yashoda?! Ward girls! Emergency! Let her take rest. I am sorry about Anwar guys. We have important information, from the CBI, regarding Olivia.. Which is? They checked Olivia's travel history. and found that she regularly visits India... That too... Secretively. The length of her stay each time... Would be exactly three days. She's made four such visits in two years. The CBI enquired about others... who had a similar travel pattern. And dug out a list of 122 women from all over the world. Rishi, give me that file... Yes, Sir. Yes. Thank you. This is the list of those 122 women... To get more information on these 122 women.. who came to Hyderabad, and their activities, The CBI had approached us for support of the local force. Are there any similarities... between these 122 women? Yes. They are all super-rich women. Aah... One of them is an Italian named Elena. She had come to India 180 days ago. So it's time for her next visit now... That's right. Then I'll check with the airlines. Elena is our last hope now. And this ring.. I don't remember how she looked... What're you doing here? Yashoda! Even I don't know... How I ended up here.. What happened to Yashoda? She felt claustraphobic all of a sudden. She's alright now. Go and get the van... Quick! Don't worry, Yashoda... You'll be fine. Take her to her room. She'll get some rest. Yeah.. Wear this magnetic band. You'll feel better soon. Sudhamma! Sir.. Give these medicines to her. Take her to her room. OK, Sir. Why is she getting down here? Hmm.. Follow. Yashoda... How're you feeling now? Just... came by to check on you. Is it just giddiness... or are you vomiting? No. Just feeling dizzy. Not everybody goes through vomiting bouts. It was the same with Kajal... She used to only feel dizzy... Poor girl.. I wonder how she's doing. She couldn't become a mother.. I hope they paid her in full. I hope she was able to free her mother. By the way, Did you find Kajal? She left. Did they take you to the same place as her? I don't know, Leela.. Everything here looks the same. True. It's so lavish... We have everything here... yet, I feel uneasy... These refrigerators and ACs are able to cool down most things. But for some reason.. They're not able to help me cool off. Leela... Kajal... Hey! Leela... Sudhamma is looking for you. You've not eaten yet. Haven't taken your tablets yet... Once you reach your final trimester... You'll understand our fears. Ok Yashoda. I'll leave. What's wrong with her? Everything's fine here. What's the time now? Go on! What's the day today? How many days has it been since you've come here? Without knowing anything that's happening around us... We just eat and sleep. Hey! Why're you taking it out on me? Oh! You have these many questions Ask Madhu Ma'am. She'll clear it up. Come... Let's eat. Come dude... I'm not hungry. You go. What's your problem, guys? Sudhamma... Sir.. Give these medicines to Yashoda. OK. Also ask her how she's feeling and let me know. OK, Sir. Take these. They look new. Gautham Sir gave them... He also enquired about your health. I can see clearly now. Yashoda... They're taking Leela to Zone 2 for delivery. Just relax. We'll take care. Leela! Leela! Leela! Leela! Rishi. Don't lose the vehicle. I can't see it, Sir. They couldn't have gone far... I think we lost them... Let's get down and check. Go that side and check - Yes Sir! Sir! Nobody went this way. Sir... There is no trail here... Boys! Let's go! Hey. I need to pee. I'll be right back. Be quick. Sir! What happened? -What? Oh God! Go back... Back! Go! Keep going! Hey Rishi... Relax. Relax! Ram... Call Balram. No network... Sir... Over there... Signal jammer. They took Leela inside... Come... Let's try and open that door. We can't open that door. It's a metal door... 16 layered locking system, and some rooms inside are really dark... If you want to have some kind of visual.. you need infrared glasses. How would you know all this? Hmph You need more details? Understood! But why? Because I am one of them. What're they doing to Leela? Do you know the rules here? Nobody is allowed to see this. The ones who do... are not allowed to stay alive. Jenny, stop! The baby will be harmed... So much love for the baby you're renting out your womb to. Oh! Worried about not getting paid? Who's there? Jenny! Jenny! Madam! Madam... Come in, Madam! Jenny's dead! Jenny's lying dead in Zone 2's janitor room. What? Who killed her? No idea Ma'am. I'll get on it immediately. Check the last log entry from Zone 3 to Zone 2. Checking, Ma'am... Gautham Sir's was the last entry. Gautham? Load footage from Zone 2 rooms on my screen. Yashoda... Kajal... #Kajal... 6 months.... Hmm. There she is! #The baby growing in my womb is God himself. Sir! Yashoda? Hey... Yashoda! I'll find you no matter where you hide Yashoda! Yashoda! Enough! Come out! 304.. I got you! What happened? Sir! Sir! You see this room? We can see any corner of the world we want. It's a knowledge room. Hmm... Shh! I love... pregnant women... I'm going crazy... There's nothing fun in you being co-operative... The real fun is in making you submit... My wild cat Meow meow... What's going on here? I don't know...! Out with it...! Only Madhu Madam knows... Double 1 Double 1... That's the password What happened, Yashoda? What's with the wounds? The blood...? Are you looking for something? I'll give it to you. What do you need? Tell me. Go on. What happened to you? Who are you? What's going on here?! Yashoda, what are you on about? It's a surrogacy service. Don't! Stop sweet talking. Enough of your lies! Tell me what's going on here. Tell me! Don't ask her anything, Yashoda. Don't think. Just kill her! She's not human. Kill her! I'm trapped here... Just like you are. This place... This place is a web. If you let her go... She'll kill you! The atrocities that she & her men commit here.. I'll explain it to you... Yashoda... Here! This hard disk... contains all the evidence. This is enough to prove all her crimes! Gautham! Yashoda... Don't think... Kill her! Gautham?! - Kill her! Kill her, Yashoda! Give it to me! Give it! Yashoda, Yashoda.. You know what this is... A scalpel! if I slice your neck with this... It'd be a quick death. It won't be interesting though... But if I cut you deep right here... It will reach the oesophagus. Your death... will be very interesting...! What's this, Yashoda? When you're pregnant... you shouldn't strain yourself like this. What if something happens to my asset that's inside you? Ptch Come... Sit. She had the knife at my throat... and you were provoking her... What if she had killed me? What now, Yashoda? Who am I? What am I doing here? You want to know all of that. You could have just asked. Instead... You killed Jenny, went to the mortuary room, and to the asset room, Why the unnecessary stress? She genuinely loved you. She was ready to do anything for you. He's no less.. Shah Jahan built the Taj Mahal for Mumtaz... Should I tell you what he did for me? I'll tell you... Listen up. And it's time to announce the results for the Inter-college beauty pageant competition. Our Honourable Chief Guest... State Minister & Founder of MRP party, Shri Giridhar Garu is here now! Greetings! Greetings, everyone! They had asked me to be a judge... for the beauty competition but I said no to them. I don't like these beauty pageants. What is beauty? Beauty is... Inner beauty, The beauty of the soul. If that's there, you don't need tons of makeup or creams... Or any other... - I am sorry, Sir. Yes... I beg to differ. Madhu... Hey Madhu! Keep quiet! No no no... Don't stop her. Don't suppress her freedom of expression! Let her talk... - OK, Sir. Please come forward. Please... Let me ask you a question... How many of you... have photos of Gods & Goddesses in your homes? Let me rephrase it... Does anyone have photos of Gods that are not beautiful? God isn't visible to us. But do we feel like we shouldn't care about how He looks? No... We want Gods who are beautiful. So... Beauty is God! I've spoken out of turn in front of the Minister... So I know I won't be selected now. But that's fine... I'll crown myself! Thank you for the opportunity. How did you... You were right, Madhu. Everybody likes beautiful things. Thanks, Gautham. I really love you, Madhu! A rose is very beautiful... But in your hands... it's disgusting. Understood? Why are you being so rude to him? He's a genius. His college papers have been approved by a German University. He's very intelligent. Is the brain visible? Only the face is. Come. Your call. This is the girl. Grab her! - Hey, Stop! What's all this? Who are you all?! Madhu! Madhu! Who are you guys?! What? Is this because I opposed you on stage? You're threatening me now? I want to marry you. Huh? A politician's life... is active on the outside but very boring on the inside. Quite irritating. The money I have might be black... But my life could become colourful... if you step into it. Why did the minister come to our house? Do I look glamorous? I myself feel like marrying you. Madhumala is an amazing girl! I'd be lucky to have her in my life. So the marriage alliance.. is for which son of yours? Not for his son... He's the groom! Huh? Are you crazy? He's way too old for you! He looks like he's my age. No, no... He's 5 years older than you are. And 500 times richer than you. If one wants to be King... They need to win a war. But to be Queen? One just needs to win the King over Till now, it was the Raja Mahal... From now on, it's the Rani Mahal! Have protection? I'm not used to it. If I become pregnant... It'll affect my beauty. That's not my problem. Madhu... You have a rare syndrome called 'Werner.' The main issue with this condition... is rapid aging. That means that you... Mm... will start looking like a 60 year old in a couple of years. Why do I have it?! Your pregnancy might have triggered it... Maybe... Start the treatment immediately! No matter how much it costs. Sorry, Madhu... The treatment isn't available anywhere in the world. Abortion is a very risky option as well. No need to worry... The blood scared her. That's all... That's not it, Doctor... Will she get her beauty and her glow back? She will never be able to regain her youthful features again. I'm so sorry. - It's Ok. Drop her back in her home... Ok, Sir. If she asks to meet or talk to me.. Just... Take care of it somehow. Don't let her see me again. Ok, Sir. - You manage somehow. Who's there? Gautham... Are you here to insult me... now that I look hideous? No! I will make you beautiful again. There's no cure.. for this according to the Doctors. How are you going to fix this?! I can do it! The research that I'd submitted to the German University.... is about Dermatological problems. That's why I am confident. But... Once you become beautiful again... You have to stay with me. Promise? Come, Madhu. Is this your lab? Yes. You'll treat me here? I'll transform you the same way. Now... You are more beautiful than ever. I must say... You are extremely beautiful. What took you so long? Hey! What a beauty you've become again! Any longer... he'd have actually married me... and we'd have started a family. Traffic Jam, baby. What're you guys looking at? Sorry, Gautham... You were the one who made me beautiful again... But the money was Giridhar's. That's why... I have to go back to Giridhar. Continue... Hehehe. Your beauty is mine... Forever mine! Let me go Sir! I am getting a call. Is he a scientist or a sadist?! Gautham.. Shut it! What?! I'll deal with you later... Before that... I need to talk to him. You can sing songs and dance with Madhu all you want... But do it all within 6 months. and you'll go back to your old self. You told me this would be a permanent fix. I am no sage to grant you a boon. Hey! I'm a bloody scientist! I made you beautiful again... If you want to remain beautiful... You need a booster shot every 6 months. But you acted in haste. Hey boys! Come... Come and kill me. Come on! - Guys, Stop! Gautham... I... was stupid. Sorry. I now realize... How much you love me. Love, my foot! If money was what you wanted.. I would have given you all of it. If I had gone public with this treatment... Every wealthy woman would have queued up. I could've made millions. Boys! Come, kill me! Hey, hey! Stop! We're talking here... Why're you coming on to him like that?! Gautham, Gautham! I won't let your miraculous invention.. vanish without a trace. Madhu needs your treatment... And you want Madhu. I strongly believe that the world needs to know your talent! And... The three of us can profit from this business. Look... The formula is yours... The investment is mine... Madhu will look after marketing. It's a tripartite agreement, man! Come on... Go on... Come on! That's how the three of us started this business together. Embryo Vitrification Artistry. This is Gautham's brain child. Giridhar's become the Central Minister. I became the face here We're unstoppable! You'll see how big my business is... once you listen to my presentation. Look... I'm getting late for my presentation. How do I look? You take care of her. I'll start my presentation... You can join me later. Welcome! Thank you all for joining in this very special video presentation today. Women, generally, are very beauty conscious. Women.. No matter where they're from... Spend every last penny of theirs.. on their appearance. Correct me if I am wrong... Kohl, lip pencils, eye shadows, foundation, primers.. Soap, cream, shampoos, oils etc. In our day to day lives.. These are household items. See, we need to focus... There are two categories. One, people who want to look beautiful. And two, people who want to disguise their age. What if I can say... I have a serum... That stops time. What if I can say... You can stay young forever. Ladies and Gentlemen! We have a million Dollar product. We can make millions more. By charging them extra... For the booster shot every 6 months. Sounds interesting. May I know your client's names? I am sorry... That's highly confidential. But I can tell you... We have some of the most affluent women as our clients. We have top CEOs, Presidential candidates, Hollywood actresses, and a whole lot of supermodels They're known, not only for their beauty, but for looking absolutely young. Even at their age. We happen to see them in India... Every 6 months. What about Olivia's recent visit and her subsequent death? I was just going to come to that. The women who've taken our booster dose... mustn't take any other drugs for the next 48 hours. In Olivia's case... Somebody.. had drugged her with LSD. Can you reveal the main ingredient of this serum? The serum's... secret ingredient is... Human foetus. Yes! You heard me right. Human foetus. The foetus... in a mother's womb.. grows without direct sunlight. The plasma that the foetus contains... remains pure. That plasma, Through a special procedure, is used to make this serum. All this is done in our state of the art Dark lab. How do you manage to collect these foetuses? Foetus farming. We bring in economically backward women... in the name of surrogacy and monetary compensation. And when it's time... We induce fake pain in them, and perform cesarean. The foetuses are then preserved in the asset room. And as per demand.. We use the foetus for our serum. What if someone reveals all of this? No chance! Everybody comes here to earn money. and if we are ever suspect anybody... We finish their account. You told us everything. What if we copy it? I may have told you everything... But the formula... is still ours. Let me introduce you... to the brain behind the brilliance. My partner... Mr. Gautham! Ladies and Gentlemen, if you have any questions.. You may ask. Do you have any other products in the market? Along with this, In the open market, We're running 'Kraft' cosmetic company. The lower grade serum is being used in the fairness cream. Despite there being many products... our company is at the top because of 'Kraft' cosmetics' brand power. Sounds good. But how are you keeping such a big crime under wraps? There's no risk free industry, right? A supermodel girl called 'Arushi" was trying to dig deep into our business we killed her and make it look like an accident... We have our counter measures. So we want our fairness cream and the foetus treatment to reach consumers worldwide. That's why you've all been invited here. So if you understand our concept, We can all move forward together. Yeah, Sure. Why not? Excuse me... How can we remain calm after getting trapped? You think we were trapped because of the buffaloes? No! Elena hadn't actually come here from Italy. They trapped us, using her as bait. How so? When Elena was walking out of the airport... There were no tags on her check-in luggage... When Elena got into the black vehicle... There was someone inside. If I'm not wrong... That person.. trapped us here! Who's could the person be? Commissioner Balram! Why did he have to do all this? So... He gave us full powers and supported us through the investigation! That's what you believe. Balram was transferred here to help close this case. Don't worry Sir. Leave it to me. I'll handle it. In fact, if you remember.. When Altaf offered to help.. they got him killed. They got to Eagle guy because of the information we gave him. Anwar? Didn't the commissioner get injured when Anwar was attacked. But he didn't die. Rishi! Rishi! Rishi! Rishi.. My dear Special team. There you go! Boys! So good to see you. Vasudev Sir... Relax. Relax, it's OK. Thank you so much, Mr. Vasudev. For making my job easier. When committing a big crime.. we need to be able to recognize our loose ends. We used you for that. And now that you've revealed everything, My boss asked me to give you a send-off, personally. So... Here I am. I want to reunite you all with Anwar... That'll be the end of the story. We treated you like a VIP. You... truly disappointed me. Meet my friend, Veeru. All he needs is a small signal. He'll bite till you die and send you straight to heaven. Or you could choose to jump, and end your life. Up or down? Your call. What'll it be? How about a third option? Not as a favour to you... It's for my asset growing in your womb. I need it for a Brazilian client. So if you come with me... You'll die a peaceful and painless death. Promise. One second. Just a minute. Yeah OK... Balram... Is the job done? I'm on it Sir. Here you go. I've just taken aim. I called so that you can have a look. It's no movie shoot for me to be interested... All this isn't new to me at all. Inste ad of killing them off and getting promoted... You're wasting time. What's wrong with this guy? What now? Any last words if I may ask? Mr. Vasudev. Thank you. For what? Before we could figure out who the person behind all this was... You called him and revealed him to us yourself. It's Giridhar. Intelligent man you are, Mr. Vasudev. You're about to die. There's no point. Come, Yashoda... I was worried that you would've ran away without giving me my asset back. I was suspicious from the first day I saw you in Zone 2. That's why I faked my feelings for you. That day, at the emergency ward.. when you fell on me, unconscious... I knew you were up to something. You stole my access card. I knew. When I came to visit you in your room... You weren't there. Very suspicious. and the window was broken. I found your wristband tracker. By the time I came back.. I saw you holding Madhu at knifepoint. Who are you? What do you want? I'm talking to you... Yashoda. I was... looking for Leela. No. Even after spotting Leela in the mortuary... You continued to look for somebody else... Who is it? And... There are no loose ends in my business. Do you want me to give you a demo? This is my forest guest house. In these foothills... Watch how I treat the people who've come to nab me... Hi Balram! You're on time! Hey Gautham! Of course, Yes. Sir! - Hey! Why the delay? Finish him off! Go on... No! Don't shoot him! He's not your average Joe... He's the brains behind the business. Who is that?! Show yourself! Balram, No! Drop the gun! OK... OK... I'm asking you to show yourself! Show yourself if you have the balls! Is courage only the virtue of men? Are you surprised to see a gun in my hands? Are you scared? How... do you have a gun? You see everything, don't you? Didn't you watch me kill Nagu? You were lucky to find it... But handling a gun ain't easy. Just have to pull the lever. Isn't that all? 9mm model, 50 meters range, 13 rounds magazine capacity, 1.075 kgs weight, Semi automatic. All I have to do is pull the trigger. The next bullet in this magazine will get ready to kill you. And that too.. you're in point blank range. If I fire.. straight to heaven... No... To Hell! I may have lost a leg... But I have many arms... Sir...! He's the main criminal! Hmm. So you see police officers... and think you are one of them, is it? Clueless idiot.. You're looking at a Police officer. She's a well trained Police officer! and my proud student! # Raise.. raise.. raise… # Raise.. like a giant wave… # bounce like a thunder… # like a lightening.. # show to this world.. who you are! There are two things I like My sister Brinda and my dream of becoming a Police officer # All the hurdles in your path.. will miss the plot… If I let pain get to me.. I can't be a Police officer. # this dreams… hidden in your eyelids # will turn into reality very soon… # till then fight with courage.. # that will lead you to your destiny… Yashoda was the best student in her batch. I thought that she'd get the best posting after her training completes. Akka... How did the interview go? What happened? Nothing. Yashoda? - Sir. She hid the truth from me at first... and finally told me what happened... There's a high demand for this job... About 20 lakh rupees. But I'll give you a special offer. If you come to me everytime I call you.. You don't need to give a penny. Sir! If this comes out in the open.. Many poor kids like me, who want to be officers.. will stop trying. Let it go, Sir. Please, Sir. Brinda.. The letter said that I should use this money... to bribe the cop and get the job. I immediately told Vasudev Sir about this. Yashoda and I looked for Brinda everywhere. Where'd you see her? We found out that Brinda had gone to the Government hospital a few times. Don't panic. I'll take care... Rishi... Once we started surveilling the clinic, we realized something shady was happening. Particularly, some of the nurses there seemed to be targeting poor women who were coming to the clinic. The boys started tracking one nurse closely. They called the nurse in and enquired about Brinda. This girl? This girl came to me, asking for money. I just told her that she'll get paid if she chooses to be a surrogate. Where's Brinda now? I don't know. But... She signed a contract that she would give birth 5 times in 5 years. That girl... asked for 20 lakh Rupees. You know all of this but don't know where the girls are sent? I honestly don't know, Sir. Talking to the girls and convincing them is our only task... After that, an agent called Vasco takes over. He gives us 30 thousand Rupees and our job ends there. Sir, let's nab Vasco. The truth will come out then. Vasco isn't just one man... It's the name they all use... This Surrogacy network.. is not limited to just this one clinic. There are many people who are a part this. For the money. Like me.. A lot of nurses and Doctors are involved. If they find out that the Police are looking for an agent, They'll kill him. Who can you capture? and where will you look for them? Sir, if this were a smuggling case... we could've gone for an undercover operation... But this is completely different, Sir. What I think is... To find the place where they are kept... and to find out what they are doing with the pregnant women... There's only one option, Sir. Somebody from our department... A brave woman should be sent undercover. I'll go, Sir. No, Yashoda. You don't have an official posting yet... The department won't be able to support you... And without guns and gadgets... I don't think... Sir... Even if I don't have any guns on me... I have the confidence you gave me. This decision... will definitely disturb both your personal & professional lives. And... the pregnancy.. Brinda is younger than me. I am not just her elder sister... I'm her mother too. I'm going Sir, I'll try my best to save... Everyone. You may have been keeping an eye on me... But I came here only to keep an eye on you! My duty started from my first day here... Learning what everyone was up to. Figuring out this place.. Where the cameras were... How many there were.. I noted it all down. Important camera positions & their blindspots. I marked the map out with my bindis on the mirror. Yashoda...! A patient has gone into labour... I need to attend to them immediately... Not even one life will be lost from hereon. Boys! Watch out! - Sir! Vamsi! Cover! Why the hell are you shooting at me?! Kill them! Walk! Walk! Sir! Take care! Sriram... get Sir out of here. - Yes Sir. GO, GO, GO! Go catch them! Go! And don't spare them! Drop them! Drop the guns! Go in to that room... Go! ... What are you waiting for, boys? Let's arrest him and proceed legally. I..am the Commissioner, God dammit! Don't you ever forget that! He's supported criminals while being the Commissioner... He got Anwar killed... Don't listen to him... I am not the Police to file a case and proceed legally... I'm Military! Stop it, Vasudev! Just kill him! And believe me... This is for Anwar... Sir...! Yashoda... Let's go! Brinda... Brinda... All girls... Please assemble in the yoga hall immediately. I repeat.. All girls... Please assemble in the yoga hall immediately! Girls... Stop whatever you're doing... and come to the yoga hall immediately! I repeat...! Please come to the yoga hall immediately! I repeat... Please come to the yoga hall immediately! Shit! We can't go by car... Get down boys... I guess this way - OK. Does anyone know... Yashoda's sister, Brinda? Do you know? What is this, Madhu? You seem to be looking for my sister? What will you do if you find her? Nothing... I was just asking. Everybody here is like my sister. Now tell me, What will you do? If everybody is your sister? I will kill everyone. Yashoda? Why all of them? Why not just kill you? Why are you getting angry, Yashoda? What will you do saving all of them? Everyone here lied to their family. They can't go back home as pregnant ladies... If you try and hide them till they deliver... What will happen to the kids? If it does come down to it.. I'll raise all the kids! Because I am Yashoda! You know who Yashoda is, right? The mother who cared for Lord Krishna himself...! Down! Rishi... Come here! Open this... Here. This one. Lift it. Madhu... There! She's running away! Hmm... Please leave me! Didn't I help all of you? Think about it once... All of your problems... were solved...! I protected all of you... I helped so many women look beautiful again. I was doing all of this like a service... Service? Is killing the foetus inside a mother's womb service? Foetus... Womb... Please, just stop. In my facility... None of this is a big deal. Just look around you... All these women... I made them pregnant without men.. Don't come to me and rant about wombs, babies and all that nonsense. If you had given birth and become a mother... You would've known what it's like... You don't even know if I've given birth. In order to make me beautiful, Gautham had experimented on me for the first time... For that, he had asked for a foetus. I was in my 5th month then... I asked him to use my baby if he needed to. No... Abortion is risky. A life without beauty... is worthless to me. I'm ready for the risk... I used my own baby to become beautiful again... You're worse than a demon from the puranas Demon! Demon! Demon! Demon! Demon! Demon! Demon! Go back! I came in search of my sister, Brinda... But I couldn't find her. Girls, move... Move... Girls, out of the way! We have a medical emergency. I am sending our location. Come here immediately. -Girl, don't be scared. Brinda! Why did you do this? Have you become a Police officer? Emergency here. Please come fast. Somebody please help! Sir - Rishi... What's the update? The medical team is on the way, Sir. It'll take an hour Sir. Minimum. One hour?! I'll do it... This isn't new to me. I'll do it the traditional way. Girls... Gather around. Come on... Bring hot water. Move... Yashoda. Move away... Girls. Lift her feet up. Don't worry... Take deep breaths. Don't cry.. OK? We're all here for you. Be brave. That's it... Push! Push! Brinda... is she... She's fine! Leela... Your Krishna is here. The Elders always say... that every town needs a temple & a school. But I say... A police station should come first. Only then will people have some healthy fear & responsibility towards society. A Police station is more important than a Railway station. If there's no Police station... Can we walk on the roads safely? Sir... Aren't I right? Sir... Your arrest warrant has been faxed to us... I need my lawyers immediately...! Sir...! Sorry, Sir... Non-bailable charge. Namaste Mr. Minister - Go on... Look... They've arrested me. They're not taking me seriously even when I told them I am your man...! They don't seem to know what's coming at them...! Do you know where I am? Where, Sir? Hold on... I'll show you... Here. Look. Why does this look like a lock-up, Sir? Not like one... It is one. What?! How?! They called me to inaugrate their new station... And they rolled the credits on my life...! Whom should I complain to? Sir...! Sweets, Sir.
