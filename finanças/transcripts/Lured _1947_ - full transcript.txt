- John, good evening, I'm Blue Eyes. - Oh yes. - Good morning. - Good morning sir. - Good Morning. - Maxwell. - Yes. - Look. - Another poem. - Indeed. Elephants circle her smooth white arm. Good luck tokens to guard her from harm. A beauty that only death can enhance. Let's see the chief. - And get off at TX to Edinborough. - Very good sir. - Oh and tell Parrington to stand by. - Stand by sir. - Well, what is it? - We've just received another poem sir. Yeah, it was posted last night. Beauty that only death can enhance, what a night my friends, is her final dance. The P keys have fallen out of alignment. The serif of the R, is sometimes not clearly visible. The small broken curve is found in all the letters E. There can be no doubt that this poem was typed... on the identical machine used for previous verses, classified under file Q-140X. Thank you. Typewriter paper of cheap common bond, 8 1/2 by 11 1/2. No rare content. Manufactured by the Stanton Mills. - Watermark, Victoria. - Again, Victoria. No smudges, typewriter ribbon probably three months old. - No fingerprints. - As usual. - Ah, what's this. - Glove prints. Probably suede gloves. Typewriter analysis, chemical analysis, fingerprints, eh? We have precisely the same information on the other seven letters. - And the other seven girls disappeared. - Exactly. There's a homicidal maniac loose somewhere in the vast honeycomb of London. A maniac with a weakness for young, pretty girls. And not a thing we've done has brought us one inch nearer his apprehension. There's not a man in the department sir, is not been racking his brains over this case. Racking his brains? That's a mistake. We can go on racking our brains til doomsday... and young innocent girls will keep on disappearing as will this one. Whose fate has been sealed by this poem. No, it's not our brains we should rack. It's the brain that wrote this. A beauty that only death can enhance... for tonight my friends, is her final dance. Fifty will give all rubbish into enlavourish dance Pop theirs. 50 girls of your dreams to hold in your arms. Short dreams, tall dreams, blonde or brunette. Dance with one or dance with 50, only six pence a dance gentlemen, six pence. - Thanks very much Mister. - Don't want to stop, do we? - Oh, now wait a minute, I'm busy, sorry. - Have something to drink. Come on that's enough of that, move on. Oh, my aching toes, thank goodness it's only two more hours. Two hours in this cement mixer are longer than a six day bike race. - In flew a dead duck. - Come on, take a turn beautiful. What is it tonight? A sweepstakes for zombies? - I hope you two be very happy. - Thank you. Strike me pink if you aren't the prettiest little girl in the whole place. The minute I laid me eyes on you I said to meself, Oswald Pickering, that's me name... there's the prettiest little girl in the whole place. Take it easy, I don't dance. Milton is the name, Harry Milton, just want a word or two. Well, you can't take me home, I don't finish til 2 A. M. We can't go somewhere for a little drink and I loathe etchings. What's that? Oh no, no, no. I'm theatrical agent Miss. Been watching you all evening. You got personality. How you like work in a really fine place? Oh now, don't tell me Buckingham Palace is installing a taxi dance wing. No, no, no, one of Fleming and Wilde's nightclubs. You've heard of Fleming and Wilde. The brightest spots in London. You're too beautiful for a slaughterhouse like this. I've seem to heard that before. Not from me Miss, I'm bonded, Mr. Fleming's scouring the town for beautiful girls. - Ten quid a week and bonuses. - Ten quid? Audition next week. Monday, 9 o'clock. - I'll be there 9 A. M. Sharp. - Not morning Miss, evening. Whoever heard of Mr. Fleming being up at nine in the morning? Look an agent for a nightclub. - Ten pounds a week. - Oh, I'm not interested. - What? - Tonight is Little Lucy's last dance Sandra. Me and my big blue eyes are going bye-bye for good. - What are you talking about? - A man. Oh, he's so handsome and he's got the charm of the devil himself. - I'm going away with him. - But who is he Lu? His name is John and he comes from a very distinguished family. Oh, who's the luck girl this time? Me? Oh? Don't be jealous. - There goes six pence. - Yeah? Spin around sweetheart. Let's have a turn deary. Strike me pink if you aren't the prettiest little girl in the whole place. The minute I laid me eyes on you I said to meself, Oswald Pickering, that's me name... there's the prettiest little girl in the whole place. I thought the cat got your tongue sweetie, come along, let's warm up. Lucy John who? Where's he from? Here, who's paying for this dance? I'd like to know, me or your lady friend. Shut up, where you meet him? - In the personal column. - What are you two talking about? Oh Lu, not that way, it's dangerous. Not when I have my precious little friends to protect me. Elephants encircle her smooth white arm. Professor Harkness, I've been reading that stuff until I'm blue in the face. I've had the best cryptographers in London search them for some... code or cipher or any kind of hidden meaning. You know, I'd be surprised if you find any code, whatever the criminal reveals... in these jingles, he won't be aware of it. Subconscious? Nothing simple, or direct. Inspector, I'm happy to say I've been able to identify the style. You mean, you got a line on him? He's actually a poet? He'd like to be, he's imitating one, almost copied, in fact. Who? Which one? The poet that your man must know by heart is Charles Baudelaire. Baudelaire was obsessed with the notion that death is beautiful. Listen to this... A beauty still more beautiful in death. Your criminal has the same delusions. A beauty that only death can enhance. I see, but Baudelaire died years ago. Yes, quite horribly, in Paris, 1867. Your murderer... if he's at all a Baudelaire, he'd be constantly in search of beauty... and caught with it, a new lovely face will always appeal to him... or some unusual attractiveness will intrigue him, inspire him to distractedness. And he'll delight in variety and never be quite content with what he find. - Sort of modern Don Juan. - Yes, you might say so. And I hope that this will throw some light on the subject Inspector. Baudelaire, eh? Well, that might help, but at the moment I don't see how. Well, thank you very much Professor Harkness and good day. Oh, look Mr. Nelson, this is the chance of a lifetime. Chance of a lifetime? Yes, I'd give anything to get a job in a Fleming and Wilde show. Fleming and Wilde? What's wrong with your job here, eh? What's the matter with this place? It's nice, I like it. Well, I'm mad about it too Mr. Nelson, it's simply divine, just loaded with opportunities. But look, I want that audition. Won't you let me off tonight? Please. Not unless you want to lose your job girly, you know we're short of girls around here. Including your little friend Lucy Barnard. - By the way, what happened to her? - I don't know, I haven't heard from her. Maybe her landlady has, did you try the house? That's a brilliant idea, now suppose you get back to your job like a good little girl. Good bye ducky. Give me a line please. - Watch it, sonny. - Well. Hello? Hello? Fleming and Wilde Theatrical Enterprises? Hello? - Hello. - Mr. Fleming's secretary please. - Oh, just a moment. - Who is it? Darling it's not for you, she wants your secretary. She? Hello. - Mr. Fleming's secretary? - Yes. - This is Sandra Carpenter. - Who? Sandra Carpenter, I was to come in tonight for an audition, Mr. Milton gave me a card. But I can't possibly get away, the manager I... Would you tell Mr. Fleming for me? Mr. Fleming will be very disappointed I'm sure, you have such a charming voice. - Oh well, I don't sing you know, I dance. - I bet you do and beautifully. - Perhaps we can arrange a private interview. - You're intolerable. Hold the line please, Something is out of order here. Jealousy's eyes are green my dear. Don't let yours turn that dreadful color. - You're incorrigible. - Of course I am, I am an unmitigated Cad. Now, carry on my dear, talk to me. Look here, is it customary for Mr. Fleming's secretary to pass judgment for his boss? Mr. Fleming never makes a move without me, in fact he very frequently he has... me take his young ladies out to dinner in order to talk things over. - Thanks, I'll go hungry. - Lemon squash please. - You're an American, aren't you? - So? Mr. Fleming is quite partial to American girls. They have an irresistible way of putting a man on the defensive. - Robert you're... - Impossible. Now what were you saying? Would it be against Mr. Fleming's Anglo-American policy to... tell a girl when the next audition is please? - Tomorrow night at nine, can you make it? - I think so. I guarantee that you'll see Mr. Fleming personally. - Now are you happy? - I'm very happy. - Then why don't you smile? - All right, I'm smiling. Any more instructions Mr. Sec... Miss Carpenter, hello? Hello... Oh, hello Julian. Charlton has just delivered the architect's drawings. I feel rather like Napoleon after Waterloo. You sound more like Romeo after Juliet closed the balcony window. - The first girl that hung up on me in years. - Well overdue. Take a look at these Robert, I think the plans are perfect now. We shall have the finest nightclub in London. The entrance is larger than any of our other clubs. - And Charlton is redesigned the dance area. - I think the entrance is too large. We better take six feet off. The smaller the entrance, the more crowded the effect. The more crowded the effect, the more prosperous the impression. - Always keep entrances crowded Julian. - Splendid Robert. There isn't an entrepreneur in London that can hold a candle to you. There's no partner in the world like you, appreciation is in order. Oh fiddlesticks me dear, all I do is to keep an eye on the accounts. That's not so easy, it takes a magician to eek a profit out of my grandiose schemes. Let's take a look at the pretty little girls in their dancing shoes. Go ahead girls. - Aren't you coming Julian. - Feared eighth victim of poet killer. A horrible mess, you read this? You're too sentimental. The eight little darling is probably ran off... with professional charmers who promised them the riches of the Orient. You don't understand women old boy. And that was the last you saw of Lucy Barnard? Yes, the night she said she was going away with some man. The landlady reported that she left all her clothes, everything she owned. - Which wasn't very much Inspector. - The man you say she went away with... - did you know him? - No. Never seen him? All I know is she met him through the personal column, she answered an advertisement. Now can you remember at all what the advertisement said? Yes, I have it right here, it was on her dressing table. Thank you. For a fine gentleman of means desires friendship with young and untouched girl. Enclosed photographs, intentions marriage, box 477. Now tell me Miss Carpenter, what kind of a girl was this Lucy Barnard? Oh, just a nice kid. Not too smart but not too dumb. Just the kind to fall for some Casanova with a smooth line. She believed no harm could ever come to her just because she wore a... good luck charm, some silly little white elephants. - Elephants, did you say elephants? - Yes. - Around her wrist on a bracelet? - Yes, how did you know? A girl by the name of Arlette Tomlinson disappeared about a year ago. - Disapp... - Yes. A few days before she disappear we received this poem. Smile your last sweet fragile smile, Arlette. For when the roses fade, the north wind whispers, are you ready yet? This one we received last December. Move quickly to the rendezvous my light of heart Louise. No worry if the gate is shut. Your lover has fate's keys. The very next day the parents of Louise Remington.. Notified us that she had disappeared that night. Not a word of her since. Last week, we received this. Elephants encircle her... Elephants. I'm afraid you never see your friend again. - Thank you Gordon. - Pardon sir. Miss Carpenter would you like to help us? - There's nothing I wouldn't have done. - Perhaps there's something you can do now. How long have you worked at this dance hall? - Three months. - What did you do before that? I came here from New York with a show. It folded in four nights, I was broke. Stand up. Would you mind raising your skirt. Higher. - How is that? - Very nice, my compliments. - Thank you. - Sorry, but I had to. - I don't get it. - You will, can you cook? - Kind of. - Know shorthand, typewriting? Enough to make me realize I better stick to show business, why? No great matter, can you do housework? - Not if I can help it? - Could you dress a wound? - A bullet wound, perhaps? - Perhaps. Well, I don't faint easily if that's what you mean. - Close your eyes. - Now it comes. - How large is this office? - Oh about 12 by 16. - Where's the coat rack? - Between the door and the window. - What color are the walls? - Dirty beige. Oh, we don't spend the taxpayers money on luxuries. Describe me, frankly if you please. Well, you're kind of grayish, heavy set... six feet tall and you probably have stomach trouble. You have a signet ring on your left little finger... a watch chain with a gold pendant... and you try to be hard-boiled but you're really a softy. - Satisfied? - Quite. - Very enlightening. - Do I get the job? So you know what I've been aiming at? Female detective, isn't that what you've been testing me for? Exactly, our policewomen are very clever. But the unknown person we seek only goes after young, beautiful girls. - Thank you, then I'm to be the bait? - In our trap. The criminal will follow you and we'll snap a shut. But how? You'll answer every ad in the personal column for young girls wanted unattached. We'll write your replies, but you keep the appointments. Miss Carpenter, there'll be danger, great danger.. - Are you afraid? - No, not yet. You'll be well guarded but if you'd rather not. - Oh I'll help, of course. - Thank you Miss Carpenter. What about this one? One of the forces ate is assigned to it sir. - You answered these Gordon? - Aye sir. Miss Follate wrote the letters in her own hand on her personal stationary. - Leaves these four for you. - Yes sir. We'll check here in pencil, we'll continue to screen out the legitimate items. Report to me regularly. What if I get in a jam sir? We have a man responsible for you but don't try to identify him. And this just in case you need moral support. - I hope I don't shoot myself. - You won't, you're on the force now. - Good luck Sandra. - Thank you sir. Nice girl. Sorry Miss, but the position has been adequately filled. - More than adequately if you ask me. - Precisely. Good day Miss. Are you the bird lover? Well, don't tell me you want a soul mate? Oh no Miss, it is my big brother. He's very nice, you would've like him but his regiment was called back this morning. His most frightfully sorry. He asked me to bring you these. - I do hope you're not too disappointed. - Oh no, thank you very much. And you tell your big brother for me that I said good luck, will you? - Thank you, good afternoon. - Oh, good afternoon. ♪ You stole my peace of mind... ♪ ♪ You left blues to black... ♪ ♪ To mention... ♪ ♪ You fooled me with your good intention... ♪ ♪ And you were so unkind. ♪ ♪ You stole my peace of mind... ♪ ♪ From me. ♪ ♪ Daydreams fill my mind. ♪ I beg your pardon, but are you waiting for someone? Why yes, I have an appointment here. Well then, you must be the one who wrote me. I am Charles van Druten. Oh, you are? - You need a model, right? - How did you begin your letter? My letter? Dear Sir, I, I hope to be the first to answer your ad... And the ending? I'm, I'm very anxious to make your acquaintance and to start work. Will I, will I do? Will you give me the job? - You have no family? - Family, no. - Tonight you can earn a pound. - That's fine. Why do you accept so quickly? You know nothing about me, as yet. Well I, I need the money Mr. van Druten, I haven't a cent. Well then, come. Are you afraid? Like all the others? Matilda, Matilda. She came. Come in, come in. We have no time to waste. Isn't she beautiful. A van Druten figure. Now then, there is your dressing room. And madame will assist you. If you'll be kind enough to excuse me for a moment I, I must prepare myself. - Who is this van Druten anyway? - Van Druten? Why, he is the greatest designer that ever lived. - Oh, a designer. - He made this dress 25 years ago. - Really? - For a princess, her royal highness Alicia. But none since, poor soul. He's still living in those days. - Why, what happened? - Oh, mademoiselle... The princess never saw the dress, the design was stolen by his competitors in Paris. It broke his heart and his mind. - I've cared for him ever since. - Are you ready, Matil? Ready mademoiselle? Beautiful my child, beautiful. Now, turn around my dear. Ah, lovely as a painting by Gainsborough. Let's see. The house is packed. My dear child, you've never seen so distinguished an audience. Matlida, her excellency herself has just come in. - Really? - Orchestra, orchestra. Yes Cherie, yes, yes. Not so loud, it hurts the ears. Better, better. Thank you, thank you for your applause. Please, please, you embarrass me. You overwhelm me with kindness. - Your royal highness. - He's a little... You're telling me, is he dangerous? - Not if you humor him. - Oh? But don't upset him. I'm honored by your patronage, inspired by your presence. Tonight, I offer for your approval, my latest creations, exquisite, inimitable. Ladies and gentlemen, this gown was designed for the Venetian fete. Given at the palace of her royal highness, the princess Alicia. Her highness did me the extreme honor of wearing it herself. Your excellency, I've never seen you looking so well. Would you be good enough observe delicacy of this line? Turn my dear, turn. Thank you. Ah, gracious lady. My poor Captain, your wife dragged you here I presume. Madame, may I draw your attention to the ingenious bodice, a lace, the subtle sleeve. Step over here my dear so Lady Winston can see you. Pardon me, please. How do you like my new model, eh? I presume you heard what happened to last one. But it's quite true, you know. Matil. - You have ruined me. - Charles, Charles... Now, now, now wait a minute Mr. van Druten, please. - You, you are their spy. - No, no, take it easy I... Easy, you think it's easy to steal my ideas, that's why you're here. - Oh, no. - You work for them. - Who? - Colbert de Pougy. The ones who are trying to destroy me. You'll never leave this room alive. Oh no, no, wait a minute Mister, you got me all wrong, I, I, I... - Who is that? - I, I don't know I... Don't lie. I... Well, that's the man who sent me here, your competitor, Colbert. Colbert. Yes, that's who it was. Colbert. - Oh, mademoiselle... - Help me out of this. - This time I'll kill you. - Here. Quick take me Scotland Yard. Didn't you hear me? What do you want? Let me out of here, let me out, let me, help me. Drive on, that door doesn't open Miss Carpenter. - How do you know my name? - Oh, I know everything Miss. You were a taxi dancer now you're working for the police. - Who are you? - Barrett is the name Miss. HR Barrett, been on the force 29 years. Well for heaven's sake... - why didn't you tell me? - We had to make sure you could take it Miss. With all the goings on and everything. That's just great, he could've killed me. You know he was awful close to it. - But wasn't I right there all the time Miss? - I don't know. Didn't I popped right up when you needed me? Well I guess so but... - what happened to that horrible man? - He landed right in my arms Miss. The constable on the corner's got him now. - He's crazy, you know. - Don't you worry about him Miss. A good night's rest and pleasant dreams, you'll be all ready for the next one. Oh, I hope you're right. But you want to learn to take care of your gun Miss Carpenter. Here's your toy. - Thanks. - That's all right. Here's yours. - Thanks. - It's all right. What you mean she's disappeared? Well, like I told you Mr. Fleming... I goes back to the Palladium but she don't work there anymore. Did you ask the proprietor where she went? The proprietor gave me the number of her flat... but the landlady says she cleared out two days ago, bags and baggage. And nobody knows where she is, nor what she's doing. Blimey. - Maybe the poet killer got the poor girl. - Nonsense. She's one girl that can take care of herself. She wanted an audition then and she probably wants one now. Coming Robert? We mustn't be late, Sir Charles is a stickler for punctuality. Yes, coming. You keep searching Milton. Find this Sandra Carpenter and bring her here in person. Great Scot. You still concentrating on international affairs? You didn't hear her voice Julian. I want to see the girl that goes with it. If anyone calls I'll be at Sir Charles'. Now we come to Article Nine. It'll be quite a privilege to have you on our board of directors Sir Charles. Oh, I like the idea very much. It's quite a departure for a scholared old banker. Well, your investment will be quite safe, I assure you. The club will be last word in night spots, by far the most spectacular in London. As I was saying gentlemen, now we come to article nine. - The party of the... - Oh nine, which reminds me. You'll have to excuse me Sir Charles, I have a very pressing engagement. - Why of course, old boy. - Good night Julian. But Mr. Fleming, I've not finished yet. Mr. Wilde will hear you out, he has the trained ear. - Good night Mr. Wilberforce. - Good night. Well, article nine... I beg your pardon Sir Charles, the advertisement. - Excuse me Mr. Wilberforce, will you please? - Yes, Maxwell. It must be in before 11 sir. Aristocratic home offers unusual opportunity for attractive woman. 18 Kenilworth Square. Send this off Maxwell, will you? I'm sorry gentlemen, domestic crisis. We've lost three maids in the last six months and all without giving notice. It's most annoying. - Carry on, Wilberforce. - Yes, yes, yes. As I was saying, now we come to article nine. That's more to the point, isn't it Maxwell? Turn around. Very nice, I think you'll make a satisfactory parlor maid. Maid? Oh, it says here, unusual opportunity for unattached. - I'm sorry, I'm not interested. - Really? No, you see, your advertisement was in the personal column, not the want ad. Was it? How odd. There must've been an error. - You're not married? - No. - You have no steady male friend? - No, not even an unsteady one. Then perhaps this job will not be as routine as you imagined. I would say it has rather interesting possibilities for anyone... as attractive as you. The girls who were here before you all went on to much... Marie, tend to your own business. But she's quite right about the other girls who were with us. - They've all done very well. - I see. Well, if there's really a chance for advancement I... would you like to see my references? I'm not interested in references as much as in character. I like your character. - I can see that from here, Mister... - Maxwell, Lyle Maxwell. But in front of the others you must call me sir. Yes sir. - Marie. - Yes sir. Show her her room and inform her of her duties. Yes sir. What's new besides walking milady's bloodhound? Milady's butler got ideas. I don't blame him but I'd like to push his face in. I don't mean that, he hadn't even held my hand yet. But he does peek at me around corners when he doesn't think I'm looking. So? What's a six letter word meaning ancient tyrant? I don't know but I have something I should tell. The chief? Then get going, lass. Will you watch Caesar for me? The things I do for the force. Caesar. Ceasear, that's it. Scotland Yard, extension five. Inspector Temple please. Sandra Carpenter calling in. Yes. Miss Carpenter, put her on. Yes Miss Carpenter? I think I've run into plenty of something Inspector. Three girls were here before me, who left for parts unknown. - Did you get their names? - Well I don't dare shoot questions too fast. Hold on a minute. Send a man to 18 Kenilworth Square. - Census report. - Yes sir. We'll get the names. The butler calls himself Maxwell, Lyle Maxwell. Maxwell? Check Lyle Maxwell in the files. - Lively, now. - Yes sir. He said that the advertisement got in the personal column by mistake. He lied, I have the original copy just as it was sent to The Enquirer. Addressed personal column, play this Maxwell along. - And take Monday night off. - Where to? Ionian Hall. A man who signs himself Music lover has advertised for a beautiful maiden... to share his ecstasy. He'll leave your ticket at the box office. I'll send his letter along in case you need to identify yourself. Yes sir, Monday night. That means evening clothes, Inspector. That's what your expense account is for my dear, use it. - Don't think I won't. - Carry on. Yes sir. - File on Maxwell sir. - Thank you. Lyle Maxwell. Aliases, Maxine Duval, Marin Weischaupt. Believe to be born Hamburg. Paris board irregularities noted. Has left and entered United Kingdom four times since January 7th. Very interesting. And make a note for Inspector Barrett, Ionian Hall, 8:30 Monday night, white tie and tails. Franz Schubert, Symphony number eight in B minor, unfinished. Unfinished? Ticket reserve for Music Lover please. - Here it is madame. - Thank you. Robert? - Oh, hello Julian. - Of all the people. Since when did you become a music enthusiast. I thought I might find some talent among the high brows. This isn't a hunting ground for you my dear fellow. - Got a seat reserved? - No, I haven't. Let's sit together. All right, fine, then you can nudge me when I'm suppose to applaud. What you left? All I have left is a box that was just returned. I'll take it. Schubert is improving. Bravo. - I think I need a drink. - A drink? - She's stunning, isn't she? - Very. I'll see you later. - And yours madame? - Champagne cocktail please. - Champagne cocktail. - Make that two. - Two champagne cocktails and yours sir? - Whiskey and soda. Whiskey and soda, very good sir. Thank you. - You're alone, aren't you? - I'd like to be. - Oh, some sort of phobia. - Fear of meeting the wrong people. Waiter, an aspirin tablet please. - Your aspirin sir. - Thank you. He must be short sighted or a fool. - Waiter, how much please? - Oh, allow me. Look here, I'm not in the habit of letting... Hold on, say that again. - What? - Talk to me, say... Is it customary for Mr. Fleming's secretary to... - Oh? - Oh, so you remember me too? Unpleasant memories are sometimes hard to shake off. Why didn't you come to the audition? I had Mr. Fleming sold on you. He had the stage all decked out in American flags... and he sent me all over London to find you some American Beauty roses. - And you didn't show up. - And I'll tell you why, I got a better job. One with a future, no red tape, at least not your kind. - You wanted to pay sir? - Yes, for both. Thank you for the drink, I'm being paged, will you excuse me? Your change sir. - Who's that bird? - Bird? - Surely Barrett, you noticed his fangs? - One of those, eh? - What about music lover? - Obviously, he didn't show up. Maybe he did. Maybe he looked you over and decided was too risky to meet you here. - Maybe. - Get your coat. - Now? - Yeah. We'll force him to contact you in some place where there aren't a thousand eyes. Beside all this musical uproar is giving me a blooming headache. Oh Barrett, you go home and make with an ice bag. I want to stay and listen to an orchestra I don't have to dance to for a change. Hey, wait a minute, what's a, what's a five letter word meaning excavator? I don't know, besides I don't want to miss Mr. Schubert's unfinished B minor. Unfinished B minor. Miner, that's it, of course. - Madame. - Yes. Your car is waiting. - My car? - Yes madame. This way madame. What is this? The gentleman with whom you had the appointment was unable to come. He asked me to take you to him. This way madame, if you please. This is one of Fleming and Wilde's places, isn't it? Yes madame, the newest and most splendid. - Check please. - Oh, I'll remember you. Bonsoir madame, may I take you to your table? Well, Mr. Secretary? It must've been persistence that got you where you are today. I wanted you to see what you'd miss by snubbing me. Distinguished clientele, food and wine for gourmets, devastating music. You certainly go to a lot of trouble making your contacts. - Not for every contact. - Really? A drink would improve me no end, if you'll drink it. Well if a drink do that, more power to it. - Excuse me, Pierre... - Yes, Mr. Fleming. - A bottle of mums 37. - A bottle of mums Mr. Fleming. Is anything wrong? My IQ, it must've been flying at half mass. Mr. Fleming's secretary, eh? - Sonia, it wasn't my idea, you started it. - Oh, I did? But I must admit I rather enjoyed the job while it lasted. Did you? Except there was no future to it, that's why I gave it up. You're not very talkative tonight, are you? Shall we drink a toast to your friend who didn't show up? Those X-ray eyes of yours don't miss a trick, do they? - Nothing if concerns me. - How could it in this case? Has it occurred to you that I might be the one you were waiting for? Yes, as a matter of fact, it has. Did you send me that letter? I might as well own up to the confounded thing, I bundled it, didn't I? But at least the result was the same, I did meet you at the concert. Why didn't you stay until the end of the concert if you're such a music lover? - I had more important things on my mind. - Such as? Planning an evening for you. Like the song? Yes, very much. ♪ Come with me. ♪ ♪ What you ask of me, I'll give night or day. ♪ ♪ For as long as I shall live. ♪ ♪ While there's new love needs no reason ♪ ♪ I'm yours for always darling, all for love ♪ - You know what it's called? - All for love. - I've never heard it sound like that before. - You didn't write that letter. - No? - Your technique is entirely different. Well, have it your way, I've had mine. Would you like to dance or is that reserved for auditions? I'd like to, very much. I'll pass judgment this time. Darling, your successor. - For as long as she can hold him. - Obviously it's just the beginning. - The old Fleming pattern. - It's always the same. With a graceful bow he takes her in his arms... and they dance a few steps in beautiful, harmonious silence. While his busy, little brain composes charming little speeches. Now he begins his campaign to sweep her off her feet. He tells her how exciting she is, how fortunate he is. And how fond he is of red hair or black or purple hair as the case may be. Don't say it Mr. Fleming, let me guess, I'm sure it's been said before. - Have her sing it again please. - I'll be glad to. ♪ All for love, poets write the words that sing, all for love. ♪ ♪ Winter suddenly is spring and my heart blooms out of season... ♪ ♪ With a strange enchantment only you can bring. ♪ ♪ All for love, am I breaking every rule, all for love... ♪ ♪ Am I acting like a fool ♪ Oh, Mr. Maxwell. Come in. Sit down my dear, sit down. I'm sorry to disturb your afternoon's rest. - It's quite all right Mr. Maxwell. - There's something I want to tell you. - We've talked of advancement, haven't we? - Yes. I've watched you closely, and you've done very well. Thank you. Now, this evening, you're going to meet a very influential friend of mine. - Oh? - Mr. Nicholas Moryani. He's coming here. If you make a good impression on him, your future is assured. - What do you mean? - You haven't traveled much, have you? - No, just from New York here. - Never seen South America? Never felt the warmth its sun? Ah, what gaiety and color. Magnificent, the rolling tempest. The towing peaks, the charm of the cities and the people. Hospitable and rich. Oh, don't kid me Mr. Maxwell. - That stuff is strictly for dreams. - No. Mr. Moryani has it in his power to provide many opportunities for a deserving girl. Gee, I can see myself in a setting like that, but what would I do in South America? Mr. Moryani has many properties. You might start as you did here. At the height you might reach our unlimited, there. - Oh, honestly I'd give notice right now. - The boat doesn't sail til Wednesday. Oh, I'd love another boat trip. What's the name of it? It's one of his boats. - Is one thing I don't like about it though. - What? Leaving this house here, my job with you. - I've been very happy. - I'll be sorry to see you go. - You will miss me, won't you? Just a little. - Very much. You know Mr. Maxwell, I've like you from the start. - Have you? - I've often thought that maybe... - Maybe someday I might join you there. - Oh, wouldn't that be wonderful? Both of us sailing away on the good ship Moryani. Doriatus, Moryani is my friend's name. He, he's a very fine fellow. You'll like him, Moryani. - I'll put in a good word for you. - I'm sure you will. - Oh Sandra. - Yes sir? This is Mr. Moryani, the gentleman I was telling you about. I'm very happy to know you Mr. Moryani, Mr. Maxwell was telling me that... - Yes. - That you work miracles. - What's for dessert Max? - Ah, your favorite. You may serve Mr. Moryani's dessert now Sandra. - Hey. - Yes sir. - Take this. - Oh, I'm sorry sir. Would you like your coffee now Mr. Moryani? - Coffee? - Later, with brandy. Excuse me Mr. Moryani. - Oh, it should be from over here... - It's all right. - I'm sorry sir. - Sit down, I want to talk to you. Thank you. Delicious. What are you really looking for? Oh, a better job, more money, a little fun. - Fun? I see. - What any girl wants. - Oh Fleming, you're incorrigible. - I'm returning on chitty charmers. - Oh Maxwell. - Yes sir. The brandy, the good brandy Maxwell. Now I know Sir Charles got the better of the bargain. - Sugar and cream Mr. Moryani? - No, black. Yes sir. - Is everything satisfactory Mr. Moryani. - Sure Max. Send her away. - Oh Sandra, five glasses for cognac. - Yes sir. - Would you mind Mr. Moryani sir Charles... - Oh, it's all right. Thank you. In the library. - Isn't she beautiful? - Who is she? Why, nobody. Nobody at all, just an ordinary girl. - Pretty, smart. - She's too smart. - I don't want her in the deal. - But... What did you tell her? - The usual things. - What did you tell her? Why nothing, nothing at all. Did you tell her the name of the boat? You blithering idiot. Well, that'll solve the problem, have a brandy.. Oh, thank you. - That should do it. - Right. Oh Fleming, have a brandy old boy. Brandy sir? - Robert, for heaven sake, where are you... - Be back in five minutes. I'm sorry Sir Charles. Sandra. Oh no you don't, not this time. I beg your pardon sir, but I'm not permitted to associate with the guests. I've combed all London for you. What on earth are you doing in this idiotic costume. Making a living sir, as a parlor maid uniform is required. Oh, a living, eh? So this is the job with a future. If you please. May I be of any service to you sir? Is there anything that you want sir? In the kitchen? Yes I, I lost a button off my coat and this young lady is going to be good enough to sew it on. - Yes I was going to find some... - Do you have the button sir? No, unfortunately, would you be good enough to fetch one for me, a black one. Very well, a black one. - Sandra. - Please. - Couldn't you get out for a minute? - I'm on duty sir. Sir, the ladies maid will take care of the button for you. - Sandra. - Yes, Mr. Maxwell. - Take this out please. - Excuse me sir. Your button sir. - Eh? - Your button. Oh, thank you. Scotland Yard please. Hello Scotland Yard, this is Sandra Carpenter calling. Inspector Barrett please. - Oh, hello Mr. Moryani. - Hello. - You don't want to call anybody. - Well they're not in. It was lonesome walking alone, I thought I'd get a friend of mine. Why didn't you ask me? We're friends aren't we? Ah, surely. Max told me how friendly you are, you're very much interested in our plan too. - Aren't you? - Oh, of course. What girl wouldn't be? South America must be wonderful, I have... - I really shouldn't stay out too long I... - It's perfectly all right. Max won't mind as long you're with me. - No I suppose not. - Oh, Incidentally, who were you calling? - A man? - Yes, a very old friend of mine. - Don't lie to me. - I'm not lying. - What are you up to? - Nothing. Why you. What are you up to? You screamed. - Nothing, nothing. - What you tell them? Robert, Robert. Robert he's got a knife. Oh, Robert I was so frightened. Oh, I'm so glad you came. So am I. I was beginning to think you didn't appreciate my advances. Oh, but I did. I do and I've thought of you but I couldn't. - Oh darling, you knew. - I couldn't get you out of my mind. Hello. Hello. Oh, pardon me. I thought I had someone for a crime. What's this? - Blimey, he's a cold one, isn't he? - Look, do me a favor, will you? - Anything you say guvnor. - This is a case for the police. Help me with him, I've got to get my girl home. Place it is guvnor, leave it to me, you take care of the young lady. Thanks. By the way, who is our sleeping Romeo? Oh, I don't know, I never saw him before. All of a sudden, there he was, pushing me around and... - Well, he's not such a bad sort of bat. - What do you mean? Look what he did for me tonight. It's true, we're engaged, I'm going to marry the man, isn't wonderful? Congratulations my dear. - My congratulations Miss Carpenter. - Thank you Mr Gordon, thank you. We trust you'll be extremely happy. - We do indeed. - Thank you. But I hope you didn't reveal your connections with Scotland Yard. No, thanks to Barrett, I didn't have to. Did you get them all? Yes, we raided the Doriatus after arresting Moryani and his playmates. Gordon has sent traces on their operations in South America. The thanks all go to you Sandra. Incidentally Sir Charles is very grateful for our bit of house cleaning. He was quite shocked when he learned that his downstairs is used as a recruiting station... for apprentices in crime. I can imagine. You will let me know the minute you have any news of Lucy, won't you? Of course. Well, isn't my guardian angle going to say goodbye to me? Well, when you leave my wings are gone. Incidentally that man of yours, he better be good to you, that's all. If you ever need a friend just remember HR Barrett. I will. When is the wedding? You'll send me an invitation I hope. Of course, but first Robert's giving me an engagement party, Tuesday at nine. You'll be sure to come. I'll be there, goodbye my dear and God bless you. Thank you Inspector. You say they're a gang of jewel thieves sir. What have the girls got to do with it... - and where do they get them? - Oh, in various ways. Such as the personal column. They round up young girls who are attracted by promises of luxury. Trip to a foreign country with all expenses paid. Guarantee of an easy job, and they're shipped out. - And when they land, they get the low down. - Exactly. Some of them are placed as hostesses in nightclubs if they are attractive enough. Others go into the best families as domestic servants. They're told what to do and they do it. And if they rebel or talk, they disappear permanently. Well, thank goodness the case is closed. And the worst one in my experience mostly the way it dragged of. Sorry gentlemen, but I don't believe this case is closed. What? Do you think a gang would deliberately warn Scotland Yard... before each of its victims disappeared? How you mean? You think they'd write poems... studiously copying the style of one of the most fantastic... madmen that ever lived, Baudelaire? Does that have the earmarks of a gang? Well sir, what is your theory then? I think we'll find in South America many of the girls who've been missing... but not Louise Remington, nor Arlette Tomlinson... or the other girls immortalized by our modern Baudelaire. And not Lucy Barnard. No gentlemen, we are not through. - But sir, you let Miss Carpenter go. - Well, she's won her spurs. She deserves to be happy. Charles, take the parcels into the drawing room. Yes sir. - Hello. - Hello Julian. My colleague and my conscience before I met you. - Robert told me so much about you. - Robert told me all about you. - Hello Julian. - Hello Sandra. - Robert is a very lucky fellow. - Persistent. Julian, you haven't lived until you've shopped for a trousseau with the... prettiest red-head in the world. Charming but rather expensive experience, I estimate. That will be all, thank you Charles. Oh, so here's where the home fires burn for those two celebrated bachelors. - For a long time too, eh Julian? - Yes. - Beautiful, really beautiful. - Well, aren't you coming in? Now leave her alone, Julian. She's trying to picture how the room will look after she's rearranged the furniture. I am not, not until Wednesday. - Oh, I feel that I'm barging in on you two. - No, no, no, I'm moving up to town. - Julian, you're not leaving this house. - Now, my dear Sandra. My dear Robert... if our marriage is going to make your best friend homeless, the deal is off. - Oh really? - Really. Well, let's discuss it over a glass of sherry. - Yes Mr. Robert. - Ah Mrs. Miller... Mrs. Miller, this is the future lady of the house Miss Carpenter for the present. - How do you do Mrs. Miller? - Miss Carpenter. Will you see that the spare room is order... Miss Carpenter will be using it on Tuesday before the reception. And will you take all this paraphernalia upstairs? Oh Mrs. Miller, my engagement party dress is in this one. Please be especially nice to it when you hang it up, won't you? - I'll be careful Miss. - Thank you. We should toast the bride, don't you think? Oh Julian, I'm not a bride yet, and I'm very superstitious. Anyhow it's an occasion for us, here's to Sandra. Gentlemen, I thank you. Now Julian, aren't you going to claim your prerogative? You don't object kissing your husband's business partner from time to time, do you? Well that depends on how many business partners you have? - Julian, go ahead. - I haven't the lady's permission. - Oh. - That's all is required. Now Sandra, I want to show you the rest of the house. - And introduction to my new job? - Yes. Beside, I want to kiss you too. - Well, I'll be blessed. - Pardon sir? The chief was right. Well Gordon. It's come sir, another poem. The loveliest one reveals the tiger's lair. Knowing not what strange love is lurking there. Wearing shimmering stars on silken cloth of blue. Her last, 'tis death with whom she'll have a rendezvous. I'm afraid Gordon, there's not much chance for this poor girl either. With her dress of shimmering stars. There. Looks like you walked through a shower of stars, doesn't it Miss? That's how I feel. Believe me, I'm getting awfully fond of this cloud I'm traveling on. Sounds like Mr. Fleming lately, he's a bit giddy too Miss. Thank you Mrs. Miller. Exquisite. Stars in your dress are only surpassed by the... Stars in my eyes, thank you Julian. - Where's Robert? - Oh, Robert won't be long. - Oh, he isn't ready yet? - Shall we wait in his study? - It isn't everyone who has this privileged. - Oh. This is the one place that he like to call his own. Well, I guess this settles, once and for all... the old question of who take longer to dress, a man or a woman? Robert is a very vain fellow my dear and vanity takes it's own time. Is that supposed to be news? Look at all the encouragement he's had. Robert dear, I anticipate loving you forever, your Margaret. Me thinks that's where Maggie made her first mistake, no doubt. There's another one. Remember the... Oh don't take it down Julian, I wasn't complaining. You might if you read this one. I'm sure Robert will thank me for disposing of this particular skeleton. I'll go up and see what's keeping him. Robert, Robert... Bad legs. Oh no. Lucy. Darling, people are arriving. - Anything wrong? - Robert. - What is it? - Tell me something. I love you, yes. Were you doubting it? Did you know her? This on the eve of my wedding with a house full of guests coming. No, I don't think so. Am I supposed to know her? I don't know. I'm glad you're not the jealous kind, or I'd have to take up farming. Did I tell you how beautiful you look? Well we can't get into that now, I want to show you off. Come in. Beg pardon sir, a Mr. Harley Temple is arrived. Oh yes. - Should I show him to the drawing room. - Would you ask him to come in here please. He's a friend of mine. Oh, I'm so glad you could come. Mr. Temple, my fiance Mr. Fleming. - May I offer my felicitations to you both. - Oh, thank you. I wonder if I could have a word with Sandra, we'll join you in a minute. Yes, of course. - Where did you get that gown? - This? - At Lorraine's on Bond Street. - Who was with you? - Why, Robert and the chauffeur. - Robert? What you driving at? Loveliest one reveals the tiger's lair. Knowing not what strange love is lurking there. Wearing shimmering stars on Si... Looks like I'm next, doesn't it? - Oh, you're wrong, Robert didn't send this. - I didn't say he did. - That's what you hinted. - I hinted nothing. I only present you with a fact. Your life is in great danger, this poem... What is it Sandra? No. What is it? Have you discovered something? Flemming's desk? But he has hundreds of pictures in here like this. - They don't mean anything. - And the bracelet? I'm sorry you two... but darling everyone is here. Mr. Fleming, I'd like to ask you a question. Where did you get this? - I, that's not mine. - It was in your desk. - Oh, it was? - Yes, please tell him why. Oh darling, I would if I knew... you can probably get those by the hundred at any novelty shop. Mr. Fleming, this bracelet belonged to one of eight girls who've disappeared from London. - Oh, why should that concern me? - This is the girl who wore it. She was a friend of mine, we've been trying to trace her. - We? - Oh Robert, please try to understand. I was working with Inspector Temple. Inspector? - Oh, so that's what brought you to me? - Oh no. - You certainly took me in. - But Robert... Inspector, tell me what made you decide to put her on my trail? Did I look dangerous? - Darling, it wasn't that way. - She was only doing her duty Mr. Fleming. Duty? I congratulate you on your skill at making love in the line of duty. How else could you've caught me red handed in my own trap? - Oh Robert, that's cruel. - Not at all, it's complimentary. I admire your resourcefulness. You've held the evidence, the pictures, the bracelet, in fact you have everything. Except the eight girls. Mr. Fleming, I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to come with me. Robert, just tell us where the bracelet came from. All right. I took it from the body of a girl that I murdered. - You believed that all along, haven't you? - No, no Robert, I haven't. Now look angel, the show is over. Stop acting. Come, come Mr. Fleming, surely you have more than this to say. Oh, what do you expect me to say, you found some pictures in my desk... together with a rather hideous trinket... and so you consider me to be an abductor of girls, a maniac who is hidden the bodies. - Is this your typewriter? - Yes. Is the machine on which the poems were typed. - You've said that before. - Do you use paper of this sort? Watermarked Victoria. My secretary buys my paper, I don't know one kind from another. Mr. Fleming, on the night of February the 3rd, a girl named Louise Remington disappeared. Can you tell us where you were that night? It was a Monday night. Your hotel dinner bill that night was signed at 8:37 pm. - You left the hotel. - Great Scot. Do you expect a man to remember a date almost a year old? You'd be surprised what a man will remember when it's important. Inspector Temple, I don't remember where I was on August the 10th, on July the 20th..., or on September the 4th. I've been out somewhere every night for years, you can ask anyone in London. Precisely and very clever too. A man who is seen out publicly night after night doesn't have to remember where he was. He's already established a cart Blanche alibi for any night of the year. And what about the photograph of Lucy Barnard? It was found in your desk. Along with about 50 others. I don't know these girls. I may have seen them, I may have talked to them, I may even have hired them. There are probably half a dozen photographs in my mail today of girls wanting jobs. Mr. Fleming, here are letters from Lucy Barnard, Arlette Tomlinson... Louise Remington and Sandra Carpenter. Each answer an ad in the personal column for young girl wanted. A photograph of the applicant was in each case attached to the letter. - Hardly my method of selecting girls. - No? Mr. Fleming, these letters were found in the files of your office. - My office? - Yes, Mr. Fleming. In your office. You, you met Miss Sandra Carpenter at the lonian Hall through an advertisement. - It's absurd. - But that's what you told her? - I made that up, I... - You mean you lied to her? Suppose you could call it that. Then it seems Mr. Fleming that you are capable of lying. Mr. Fleming why did you happen to go to the concert that particular night? I told you I was bored. But you told us earlier that you did not go to concerts because they bored you. It was a different kind of boredom that night. It was indeed, you knew Sandra Carpenter would be there. How could I possibly have known? You advertised in the personal column calling yourself music lover. She answered that ad, her reply was in your files. That's how you knew. No, I happened to see her at the concert, she was waiting for someone. - How did you know that? - I was sitting right behind her. And sizing her up. She caught my eye, yes. She's beautiful. Caught your eye? I saw a bearded man sit down next her. She showed him the note and then he left. Was really a perfect opening. Ah, so that you could carry on with your plans? I had no plans, was a coincidence. Coincidence. It's coincidence that you own a Westminster typewriter. It's coincidence that certain keys are out of alignment. It's also coincidence that you use Victoria paper. And of course it's merely coincidence... that pictures of missing girls were in your possession... and that letters they wrote in answer to personal column advertisements... - were found in your files. - Oh, for heaven sake. I don't know how they got there, I don't know. I see. Well then I suppose it's nothing but coincidence that on the last poem... we received describing the dress Sandra bought in your presence... your fingerprints were clearly marked. - That's my fingerprint? - Yes, Mr. Fleming, your fingerprint. And we anticipate finding more such evidence. - Blimey, nothing here either. - All right, that's enough. - Inspector. - Any luck? No sir. Me neither. - Scotland Yard, calling Inspector Barrett. - Barrett speaking. Chief says you can bring the men back, he's found something. Righto. That's all men. Yes, she was strangled before she was put into the river. Note the bruises, thumb marks on throat. And the distinct coloration. Body is been in the water at least two weeks, if not more. There were stones in the burlap wrapping to weigh it down. Thank you gentlemen. Ah, that must be the Missing Person's Bureau. Temple speaking. You have the pictures of the body? You checked the identification? And the name? Thank you. We had better luck dragging the river bed than digging in your garden Mr. Fleming. - Look closely please, do you know her? - No. I think you did Mr. Fleming, her name was Lucy Barnard. Does that help you to recognize her? No. No, I've never seen Robert with these girls. But surely Inspector, you don't believe that Robert strangled this Barnard girl and.. Then drown her and possibly any number of others. I didn't say he did Mr. Wilde. I said that everything thus far points to Fleming's guilt. You could do much to establish his innocence... if you could prove where he was on certain nights. February the 3rd, April 17th, May the 9th, July the 20th, August the 10th. I could look at my records. We've already taken the liberty of checking your records with a search warrant of course. There's no indication in your diary as to Fleming's nightly movements. However, we do know from it, where you were. Incidentally Mr. Wilde, why did you happen to go to the concert that night? I? I've been attending the concert every month for years. I see and Fleming just happened to go that night? - Yes, but... - And the rest of the evidence? It could've been planted on Robert, every bit of it. Including his fingerprints on that last poem we received? That proves nothing either, read that. - Now your fingerprints are on it. - And yours, Mr. Wilde. I gladly admit that, it proves my point doubly. Someone could've tricked Robert. Placed all those exhibits that you value so highly, in his desk, his files. - Who for instance? - Oh any number of people. - Some jealous woman who... - I see. One of the many employees in the club, his secretary, mine, one of the servants... his chauffeur, even I. I've thought of that too Mr. Wilde. We've questioned any number of possible suspects. Did you plant the evidence? What do you think, Inspector? I think Fleming could do a good deal worse than engage you as you his barrister. The simplest way for you to establish Fleming's innocence now Mr. Wilde... is to establish someone else guilt. Good night. Good night Inspector. - Oh Miss Carpenter. - Did you...? It's no use Miss, he hasn't changed his mind about seeing you. But he'll have to, I've got to see him. - This is all wrong, let me go in, please. - Hold on Miss. He's got another visitor in there now anyway. And one at a time, that's the rule. - Who's in there? - Mr. Wilde Miss. Oh? - Have you been able to do anything? - I've got you the best counsel in England. Sir Roland Harcourt is to be to defend you, and I assure you he'll be more than a match - to Mr. Temple. - Isn't Temple he'll be fighting. - What you mean? - The evidence. How in heaven's name was he able to get it? All that evidence pointing to me, taken from my files even from my own home. Piece by piece, all carefully labeled with my name. Every crime, ingeniously laid at my door. Who would want this to happen to me? I've spent an eternity here trying to discover that but I can't. Julian, you think I'm guilty too, don't you? No. No, I don't Robert. And I don't think the evidence against you is conclusive. - Is that Harcourt's opinion? - Well, not exactly, I... Listen Robert... Harcourt is of the opinion the evidence against you is fundable but merely circumstantial. Men had been hanged on circumstantial evidence. Robert, you mustn't talk like that, you mustn't even think like that. Let the experts call it circumstantial evidence. - I call it a rope dangling over my head. - Robert... Harcourt is confident that at least he can save you from that and get you off with a life sentence. A life in prison? - I'd rather confess and have the rope. - But Robert, listen, you mustn't... Robert... Robert, let me talk. He despises me Julian, I saw it in his face. Robert doesn't despise you Sandra. He just doesn't understand that his circumstances, not you, working against him. But I could make him understand Julian, if only he'd let me talk to him. Perhaps I can persuade him to see you. He needs you badly, of course. Yes. How extraordinary. Well, thank you for letting me know. Come in. Inspector Temple. - Good morning Inspector. - Good morning Mr. Wilde. - Are you free? - Yes, yes of course, sit down. Thank you, I've been thinking about our discussion the other day. You gave me rather a different view of the case. Really, in what way? I've come to the conclusion that you were right. Fleming is not guilty. Good. I'm glad you agree. And yet you said the facts were indisputable. Too much so too many of them and too perfect. Facts must've psychological cement Mr. Wilde. In Fleming's case, they haven't, so they fall apart. - Oh, what do you mean by that Inspector. - Let's take a look at this fellow Fleming. He's a healthy man, the sort that lives with the world. He's vain, but what man attractive to women isn't? Has a temper, but who with imagination and flair hasn't? He has tremendous enthusiasm for life and people. - And he's very honest about it. - I thoroughly agree. He envies no one, has a great love of beauty... and he makes no bones about that either, agreed? Quite, quite. Mr. Wilde, I've described the type of man who does not commit murder. He doesn't have to kill in order to win, our criminal does. I'm afraid I can't quite follow you Inspector. I'll lead you slowly. Our criminal is a man who is afraid to meet women openly in the presence of others. So he advertises in the personal column, correct? Perhaps. This man has no brilliant approach to a social existence. He leads a hidden life and finds compensation by indulging in secret, incredible fantasies. - How could you know that? - The poems Mr. Wilde. The imaginings of a man with grotesque ideas of romance. A man who finds his pleasure in destroying beauty rather than in making love to it. Interesting. To this man's way of thinking, death is more beautiful than life. Unfortunately he's compelled to express this thought. Oh come Inspector, surely that's a slim reason for murder. Mr. Wilde, that kind of expression requires murder. Really Inspector, I should never have suspected you of such remarkable insight. Mr. Wilde, may I have your copy of Baudelaire? - Baudelaire? - Yes. - But that's a very unusual request Inspector. - This is a very unusual case Mr. Wilde. There's a quotation I should like to read you. Don't think I have a copy here. I'm sure you have. You are right as usual Inspector. Thank you. Now, let's see. Let's see. Ah, here we are. Now listen to this. A shrine of death and beauty is the sky drowned in red blood. The sun gives up his breath. Don't be afraid my sweet, to die. For beauty still more beautiful in death. The poems we received were written in exactly the same meter and style. In fact our criminal must have copied Baudelaire. Very odd. Did Fleming have access to your books? The door between our offices was never locked. But Fleming hasn't the faintest idea who Baudelaire is. He never reads poetry, he doesn't like it. It gives him nothing he couldn't get from a woman's smile. - You follow my reasoning. - Yes, I believe I do. Then we both know who the real murderer is. You seem to relish the cat and mouse game Inspector. Aren't you enjoying it too? Yes, I am, so let's go on. I assume that you are hinting that I might be the murder. Very well then... we must assume that I lured eight innocent girls away and disposed of them. The police had no clue, I was quite safe. Why then did I risk sending that last poem to you? That Mr. Wilde, was the one point I couldn't understand. But it's the critical point Inspector, the crux of your case.. I didn't understand until quite recently why you incriminated Fleming. Oh? It's very simple really, you're in love with Sandra Carpenter. Yes, I am. I confess Inspector, that you built up a superb case, theoretically, of course. Incidentally it would be ridiculous to try and prove it in a court of law. Mr. Wilde... I think you'll make a great mistake if you underestimate the courts of this country. I confess you've made me feel possibly guilty. Sent a chill of terror up my spine, I confess all this. But surely we needn't play this game any further Inspector. Not in light of the glaring fact that I learned just before you came into this room. - What fact is that? - Don't you know? - Didn't you come from your office? - No, what are you driving at? Why not half an hour ago, Robert Fleming confessed. Get me Scotland Yard, extension four. Miser, Temple here. What about Fleming? When? Oh? Thank you. Mr. Wilde, I owe you a most object and profound apology. Good day. Get me Mr. Courtney, Mr. Wilde calling. Courtney, this is Julian. Can you give me space to Lisbon? No, no, tonight, I can't wait until tomorrow. Flight 16. Midnight, thanks Courtney. Yes, Mr. Julian. Are you quite sure you ordered my cab Mrs. Miller? Oh yes, indeed. That must be it now. I couldn't bear to be alone Julian. I can stay here, can't I Julian? - For just a little while? - Of course. - I've a cab waiting. - You need a rest Sandra. Must go upstairs and lie down. I'll send for Mrs. Miller, she'll give you a sedative, you need a rest Sandra. No, please Julian, I want to talk to you. I got to talk to someone. Robert won't let me go in, Inspector Temple won't even listen to me. I thought there was hope but... Robert had no right to throw his life away. He couldn't compromise on a life in prison Sandra. A life bare of beauty. It's why he chose death. Why should he die for a crime he didn't commit? - He confessed Sandra. - He couldn't have done it. He was so gentle with me. He's good Julian, a woman knows. She can tell, by the touch of a man's hand, by, by a kiss. Don't think any more Sandra, lie down and rest.. I'll dismiss the cab. Thank you, Julian. But Julian, I thought you were going to send the cab away. Oh no Sandra, not yet, no yet. We shall be needing it later. But why Julian, why should we need it? So that we may go away together, I didn't want to go alone. Well, let's go now then Julian, let's go now. No, no. I've wanted to talk to you alone like this for a long time. Sit down. Do you be happy together, for a while, here. Then we'll go away. I want you to see the river, in moonlight. You and me. There's so many things I want to say to you Sandra but Robert would never let me say them. He hates me, did you know that? He always hated me for my thoughts, because I'm cleverer than he is. He couldn't manage without me, that's why he hated me. He always laughed at me, flaunted his sweethearts. He thought he was going to have you too, didn't he Sandra? But nobody can take my sweethearts away from me. My beautiful, Sandra. - He can't have you now. - Barret... Barrett, Barret... Barrett, Barrett... - Oh Inspector, the door was locked. - It's all right, the window was just as good. Oh, Inspector. Congratulations, your timing was perfect. I was on guard against everyone but myself. Open up. Mr. Julian... Good evening madame. It's all right Mrs. Miller. - Where's Mr. Wilde going? - To prison madame. - It seems we arrested the wrong man. - This is Inspector Temple Mrs. Miller. - How do you do? - Oh, but Mr. Fleming confessed. That was our idea. One confession leads to another, at least that's what we gambled on, eh Sandra? Poor girl. Mr. Wilde did rather commit himself, didn't he? Are you saying that Mr. Fleming is coming home? Yes, that is if Miss Carpenter can persuade him to. - Do you think I can? - Of course you can my dear. - Oh Mike. - Yes Mr. Fleming. - A bottle of mums 37. - 37 sir. And two glasses. Welcome home darling, welcome back. - It was a rough trip, for both of us. - Was a nightmare. - But let's not talk about it, ever again. - Your wine sir. Darling, from now on... it'll be all for love. Ah, celebration.
