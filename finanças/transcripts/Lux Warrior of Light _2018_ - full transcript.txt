Torsten's been missing for over a week. No one has seen or heard from him since. We've absolutely no idea where he could be, and... FOR TORSTEN No, I don't have any superpowers. But superpowers don't make you a superhero. What matters is that you do something, why you do it and for whom. That's most important of all. Not to think of yourself but others. You don't need superpowers for that. We all hear our heart, but most of us are afraid of the consequences. They think, "It wouldn't go down well with others. My boss won't allow it..." The heart isn't like that. It tells you, "Chest out, chin up, do something!" It's inside all of us. Look, I've brought you something. Oh, thank you! I don't exactly know what it's like to be a real hero. But I'd advise everyone to try to be one. The mask is custom-fit, but I covered it with tape. I've been working with tape for about five months now. The gloves are from a motorcycle store. I cut off the fingers because in daily life you often need your fingertips. The protectors are made from a mix of sturdy work clothes. They protect me, when I kneel down for instance. So every detail of my costume has a real function. No matter who you are, or how others see you, there's a hero in every one of us. Trust him and he'll show himself. Mine's called Lux. I'm a Warrior of Light. LUX - WARRIOR OF LIGHT So shoot. Real-life superheroes are unheard-of here. Lux is the first one in Germany. So this is completely exclusive. It's on no one's radar yet. Superheroes are nothing if not this: extreme. But this guy... you want to go and buy him an ice cream. Who's saving whom? - Yes, it's a superhero-setting, but in real life. This enormous contrast is what makes up its quality. We could always take it to a TV station. Yeah... sure. If their target audience is over 65, then it's perfect. Saving cats from trees, helping grannies across the street... No doubt it has a lot of potential. The freak-factor alone... But don't waste it. He's great for the Net, not for Public TV. And even there he has to rock. Show me he'll play ball and we're in business. - Okay. BRANDT - NEW MEDIA I'm not so sure this was a good idea anymore. - Why? The person behind it is far more exciting. We'll just do both. I mean... if we get Brandt hooked, great. If not, we do it our way and send the film to a few festivals, okay? Yeah, okay. We've landed a producer! - Yes, you're right. - ...Probably. Be happy. - I am. - Good. Hi. - Hello. Hello. - Sorry. My shift took a little longer. - No problem. - Glad you could make it. We've landed a producer. He's excited by what you do. - Really? He'd just like you to be a little more like Phoenix Jones. I think he wants you to jump out onto the street and do some crime fighting. Okay. - But look here... Wow! Your action cam. Mine? - Yes. It's for you. If you press the button on top, it starts rolling. Now you can shoot everything from your perspective, like Phoenix Jones. We just have to see where we put it. Maybe... Sorry. Here? - Or maybe on your shoulder. Wouldn't you just love to kick some criminals' asses? Yeah... Yes. - You work out every day. Has to be for a reason. Not just to hand out food. Phoenix Jones wears a camera too. - Yes, he's badass. I mean he's done some serious close-combat training. Phoenix is a rather... different character. - But... if you were on patrol and something happened, you would step in, right? Yes, of course. - Yes. Batman! What's up? Enjoy your meal! Hello. Does it taste good? - Yes. Who are you? - I'm Lux. Lux! Hey, asshole! Ah, okay... Promise me. Promise, no drugs! Hey, we've got a "special" coming on. Out of this world cabaret! Looks exciting. - You bet! You'll like it. A shame if you couldn't make it. - Did you make the outfit yourself? Like it? - Totally! - See you. Rolling. Hello, Mom. Hello, Mrs. Kachel. We're the camera team. Hi. - Hello. Next time, tell me a little sooner. Just a tad sooner! Can't appear on camera like this. Did you bring cigarettes? Hello? Did you get me cigarettes? - They were sold out. Sure, and the Vietnamese dealers were all out dancing, right? Give me the change. Torsten, the change! TOWO REAL ESTATE NOTICE OF EVICTION I was wondering, it's not something people are familiar with, superheroes in everyday life. Does it strike you as odd, or even a little odd somehow? No, I mean, he's not any crazier than you or me. Everyone's got his quirks, we all have our quirks. And in his case it's that superhero thing. Well, Dark Knight? Here's some rocket too... - Rocket, dude! He has a big heart and he wants to look after people. And I like that. It's great. He wants to help, and he knows how to do so. He's never asked for help for himself. Ever! You alright? - Yeah. Yes, fine. You've earned it. Have a mandarin for the vitamins, then we'll have a smoke. Had enough? Want me to pull? I can slowly feel my blood pumping again. You too? What's this supposed to be? I wanted to pick up the leftover rolls. I give them to the homeless. Do you always pick them up here? - Yes. Who gives them to you? - Doesn't really matter. Well, I'll see it on CCTV anyway. First of all, you're a thief. - Man! - Stop whining. And second of all... - Those beautiful rolls! If word of this gets around, next thing you know I have a cesspool of lowlifes at my doorstep. Not only here, but at the other stores too. Think that's good for business, do you? But throwing away good food isn't... - Yeah, yeah, tell it to the bag, take it outside the door and piss off. And you too! Hey, people, I told you! Take a hike! Yes, when people see me for the first time, they can get irritated. That's why I wish people would acknowledge my work like everybody else's. To me it's not about money, but about recognition for what I do. That it has validity. Quick, quick, turn on the camera! What a jerk! In his fucking Benz. Asshole. Didn't even slow down! Tell me where... does this hurt? - Yes. Just the wound. Nothing's broken. We really should call the police. Yeah, sure. I call the cops. No, they just get on you nerves. It was a hit and run. - Nobody cares. Alright? - No worries. Great. So erm... I'll just go and disinfect my liver. - Best not. See you. - Take care of yourself, Alan! Hey, let's get married! A few seconds earlier and we would've gotten the guy. Not all that easy to be in the right place at the right time. - Lina! How do the guys in America do it? Do they roam the streets aimlessly, waiting for something to happen too? - What do you mean "too"? Well, like us. Come on. I'll buy you a drink. We'll call it a day. Alan! - What? You coming? Why? Where? - We're going for a drink. If you're paying! - Sure. Cheers! Cheers! To Lux. What are you doing? It's not that cold yet. It will be soon enough. Mom, stop saving on the wrong things. Sometimes I really ask myself who's mothering whom. Attention, here comes a poem! Talk to the camera, please. To the camera? - Sure. "The stove is heating up the room. My heart is beating just for you." Good one! Will you stop doing that? I'm allergic to that fine-dust stuff. It isn't the fine dust. - What then? Have it checked. - No, I won't. They'll sell me some expensive poison again. I'd rather have a smoke. Offended again. Can't help you there! Do you understand why he worries? - I don't know why. At the end of the day, life, in and of itself, is deadly. Because... Bang. One car and you're gone. One streetcar and you're gone. You could have eaten something bad. Torsten? - Yes? - Have you calmed down? What do you think where he got it from? - This world-police stuff? God, I don't know. Not from me anyway. I mean, he's always been helping others. It started at the daycare center. Honestly, it did. Every day he lent out his pacifier! The whole group must've had it. Really. I'm not joking! Don't know. It was... When was it? Right after the wall came down, right? He insisted on dressing up as Batman. But we didn't have the money for a real costume, so he had to wear the stupid ladybird costume. Five dots on his back. He's probably still compensating for that. STOP RENT RAISES TOGETHER AGAINST DISPLACEMENT Lux is mobilizing against the ToWo now. My mail is none of your business. You hear? - Mom, I can help. No, I can handle that myself. Got it? All by myself. They'll have to carry me out of here. TOWO REAL ESTATE Alright, man. Yes, I'm going! Man, really, I... Man! What is it you don't understand about being barred? Hey, dude, everything dandy? - You okay? Let me see. - I bit my tongue. You were barred? - What a joke. He's helping the cops. They wanna book tons of people so they get promoted. And who's best suited for that? Drunken hobos! No one cares about them. Alan, come join us. - What's this? - We need everyone. I'm busy. What? Can't I have something planned? Yeah, sure. I didn't mean it like that. - Then how? It's important to fight for each others' values. Anyone can join in. Values? Listen, values are only valid as long as a society is wealthy. If that goes, a mob rules here in seconds. No, we're all responsible for ourselves. Do you know how often I hear the line, "Nothing in life is free"? Or do you have a euro to spare? No. You see? ToWo out! Get out of our house! ToWo out! Get out of our house! We're all staying! Ayse and Karl-Heinz! We're all staying! Ayse and Karl-Heinz! ToWo out! Get out of our house! Excuse me. Excuse me, sir? You're in violation of article 17 A... - Sorry? Ever heard of the anti-masking laws? Take off that mask and show us some ID. - Go and rap their knuckles! Did you stick the mask in your ears? No more discussions. Are you trying to meet your arrest target? - I've had enough of this! Hello. Excuse me, we're shooting here! He's playing a part, okay? If he takes off his mask, it'll be on YouTube right away. Of course he's got ID. But please do it in the car. Our producer's put in a lot of cash. If it gets out who's behind the mask, it was all for nothing. Don't take him in! Leave him alone, damn you! ToWo out! Get out of our house! As a real-life superhero, you mustn't ever think you're the man, the boss. It's not about showing off. It's about doing what your heart tells you to. I don't have to do this. Well, I do, but it's not that... Well, I'm needed every day. It's not about me or what I want right now. Nothing against his rent campaign, but that's barely enough for a report. I'm creating a Brandt-new media format here, do you realize that? Yes. Good. I'd really need a tad more action. I can hardly conjure it up. And a little sex never did any harm either. No, thanks. Lina? - Yes? Do you think something like this would fit you? Here. Sorry. And then these here, fishnet tights... A great outfit. What for? Well, as bait, so to speak. You're not serious, are you? Don't be afraid. We'll be with you. You'll be safe. - I'm not afraid. Is that your "contribution"? To entrap some "evil, woman-hating migrants"? They do it in the States to catch rapists. It's just an idea, an experiment. - You don't think this is going to work just because I go out on the street half-naked, do you? Something is bound to happen. Sorry. You'll provoke an emotional act at best. - You don't even rule it out! So lock away all men, including you three! - God, calm down! Can't we discuss this in a normal way? I'm not going to discuss this... - I have an idea. Want me to send your dad a photo? So he can see that you earn money with your art? - Very funny. Sorry, it's just way too cold. There's no point. No one looks at a man standing around. Give it to me. Try to get warm first. No, let's just break this off. Let's go to the Kottbusser Tor. I'll just change. Don't forget to take off your make-up. Motherfucker, give me back my wallet! Go on! Go away! Fuck off, you filthy mutt! You okay? Are you crazy? - What? - Why's Marek filming this? Why would I tell him not to? - You have a responsibility here! Do you think I'll put it on the Net? - Yes, I do. - That's bullshit. Your hunger for moments of... Hey, man, chill, chill. What's going on here? That's dangerous, Jan! Dude! You pissed your pants! Wait a sec... Can I help? - Hey, stop it! Hey, leave him alone, okay? We're filming here. - You're what? Get out! What are you doing here? - We're leaving, okay? Get out of my courtyard! - Don't touch my cam... Slow down! Trouble at home, or something? Could you fill this out? Thanks. Hey, Boss, got a sec? I've got this great video... Awesome. He's a real dork. Watch this... He pisses himself all over his superhero gear. Where did you get it? - The Net. It was on YouTube yesterday. He totally pissed his pants. What a retard. Awesome, right? To me, a hero is someone... who puts others before himself and pushes his limits. A hero can also be someone who's not strong at all, but uses what little strength he has to do good. God, it's cold out here. Looking forward to the interview? I don't want this. Suffering from stage fright? - No. It just wasn't a good idea. That stupid clip leaves a totally wrong impression. You don't deserve that. Even so. Right! I'm Holger, pleased to meet you. - Yes. I'm Torsten. Pleased to meet you. What's with the hangover mood? Torsten's unhappy about the whole idea. Yes, totally. Then this is the wrong moment. For what? Would you like to try it on? Rad. Respect. Wow. A real shame. Why a shame? If we don't act now, no costume in the world will be able to help you. Lux will become a joke. You represent something most people miss nowadays. We desperately need someone to show us a different way. But that will only happen if we get to know the real Lux. You. As silly as it may sound, the people out there need hope. Hello! Look who's my guest today. I'm over the moon. Lux, Warrior of Light. You probably all know the video circulating on the Net. "Wetman!" Sorry. LUX- ON THE ROAD WITH - JOYCE Yes. - You're cool about it. Making people laugh is worthwhile too. That reminds me. A certain real-estate agency in Berlin doesn't have much to laugh about. Tell us why. - Yes, ToWo Real Estate is trying to drive longstanding renters out of their apartments to increase their profit. I don't think that's funny. I'll keep turning up there until they take back every eviction order. I promise. Why... do you wear a mask? It expresses my inner conviction and the fact that every one could be behind it. The thing is, if more people joined up, we could change the world, hood by hood, street by street, city by city, one day. So follow the example of Lux, Warrior of Light, Berlin's one and only real-life superhero. - Thank you. - Here you are. Here. Now run to Lux and get his autograph, got that? Move! Oh hi! So many people! I'm a huge fan! - Lux, could you write my name here? Thanks! Ciao! We want to know what you think. Tell us using this hashtag. Right. And follow us on Twitter. I've heard several viewers want to know, Lux, are you still single? "Due to increasing public pressure following a social-media appearance by Lux, Germany's first real-life superhero, ToWo Real Estate will cancel all forced evictions for the time being." I don't believe it. I don't believe it. My son's a celebrity! We have to celebrate that properly, right? Are you okay? Hold it up to the camera. LUX BRINGS REAL ESTATE SCAM TO LIGHT Is that okay? Now we're going to let it all hang out! There. Here you go. What is this? Come on, sit your behinds on the couch. Come here, Jan! Don't worry. Cheers! Cheers, my dears. - Cheers. Dude, can I make a selfie? We're here. We met the other day. Is it okay, if we film here for a bit? There's the camera. He's the man in the mask. - Oh, that's you! - Yes. You look totally different! Sure you can film. - Cool. - My act, or something? Yes, you'll be in the shot too, if that's okay. - Sure. - Super. With my soft, smooth fur I snuggle up to you, if I feel like it. How about taking a chance this evening? Seduce a genuine big cat? There's one thing you should know: I won't be domesticated. Black cat. Pussycat. I am... But I can be a kitty too. Deny me my caresses, then I'll feel lonely and forsaken, and I'll just take a different Tomcat home. Let me seduce you tonight with soft paws instead of airs. There's one thing you have to know: I won't be domesticated. I am a... pussycat. What happened? Fell off your bike? No... This morning on our way home three skinheads were harassing a Lebanese guy, and Torsten thought he should intervene. - Yeah, so? Nothing. He's fine. Nothing happened. Did he chicken out? - If only! I stepped in and got clobbered. I thought that was it, end of story, we'd get slaughtered. - Cut the heroics. We were fucking lucky. The cops came by and the three of them took off. And? No, it's okay. No harm done. Did you get any of it? I got my face busted, how am I supposed to film? - And Marek? He had to leave early. - I don't believe it! We'll be in touch. Tarek, stop the car. The gentleman will continue on his own. About your mom... What? Aren't you going to do something? She coughed up blood in the kitchen the other day. Yes, she does that. And that's it? She won't see a doctor. You know her. - She must have it examined. It could get really bad. Talk to her again. She'll just close up. It's no use. Sometimes I think she's meaning for it to happen. Guys, guess what deal I just made with Brandt? Lux is getting his own music video. You're gonna rap. Me, rap? - Yes, you. I can't rap. You're authentic. That's what matters. Can you fly? - I put on my cape. Yeah, man. - 'Cause I'm your handsome man, because I'm a great rapper. We are together. - It's true. Marathon, marathon, rubber man. Bench-training plan on the wall. Bling, bling, Superstar. Six-pack? - You bet. Biceps, triceps? - All there, all fair! Here's Lux, yo. The Warrior of Light. He's stronger than fiction, so never fear. His inspiration: the bad guys in the hood. Always on a mission. You are his beat! - Here's Lux, yo. The Warrior of Light. I'm stronger than fiction, never afraid. My inspiration: the bad guys in the hood. Always on a mission. You are my beat! Here's Lux, yo. The Warrior of Light... The people are going to love this. Where did you find the lady? She has a great presence. - We met her at a burlesque show. Great woman. - Totally. She's got something special. - Yes. You'd be an awesome team. Five, four, three, two, one! Happy New Year! Best wishes! - You too. Guys, tonight all drinks are on Brandt, so here's to our video! There you are. - Cheers! - Cheers. You've helped me realize a dream! Our pleasure. - As a kid I wanted to be in the movies. But then I ended up in the circus. Sort of grew into it. Then I got by at cabarets. I wasn't good enough for the big stage. Just for the small stage, the seedy one. But that's fun too. I made up Kitty myself. Not just the character, also the costume and everything. That's something I really enjoy. But I can't get by on it. But maybe in the future, right? To Lux! - To Lux. So what do you do, to get by? - Table dancing. Drop by some time. - I will. The girls dancing there are very pretty. - Yeah? - Okay. It'd be great. - Hey, you losers! What are you doing? We're here to dance! Come on, show me a superhero move. Are you okay? Come here! Come here. - I need help. Now... stop filming. Leave Marek be. - No one wants to see this. - Why not? Marek, switch it off. - Ouch! Why shouldn't he work? - I'm the only one! - I don't want him to film every crap. We'll see about that. - Yes, we will... Torsten. Torsten! Wait! Is it because of Alan? It just doesn't feel right anymore. - Why not? I don't know. The TV interviews, the music video, it's all just show now. Yes, but it's made you famous. If you really want to change things, that's absolutely essential. And if it's for a good cause, then it's completely legit. Just go on in. Good evening. I'm going to have a smoke, you coming? - Yes. I'll just put something on. - Okay. How about teaming up with me? You know, "Lux & Kitty". We'll go out on patrols, fight crime... Yes? - Well, I'll do videos any time, but I don't feel like going out in the cold at night. It's not my thing. But thanks for asking. Kitty! You have a private dance in booth three. See you later. Later... Why did you want to come here tonight? - An anonymous tip. Let's go! - Shit. Come on. Alan? Who did you expect? The Joker or something? You broke into this place! I sleep here sometimes. - You stole something. Nothing anyone would miss here. - And what's that? I don't know. I really don't! Calm down, dude. Someone offered me money to pick this up. I'm just a courier. And who's this "someone"? - No idea. Man, I was drunk. "Half now, half on delivery..." Open it. - You can't be serious. Open it! - Okay, here. There... ... money. Oh, fuck. No... - God, no, Alan! Yeah, sure... - You know what this looks like. They wouldn't let a hobo like me walk round with their dope. - Jan? Hey, this is cocaine. - I never touch the stuff. You know that! Shit, did you think you were carrying aspirin around? Someone set me up here! You know me! That's what I thought. - Come on. Here. Take the lot. Give the stuff to the police, and there's an end to it. Right? He'll be booked for possession otherwise. This is not up to us. - The police have to investigate it. What good would that do? Someone else will collect the stuff. - He's right. Oh, no. Shit. - Oh, great. You love this! A cool crime-story! Wonderful! You get off on that, right? They got the hobo again. - Calm down. When you use your powers to harm others, it's like your compass is out of whack. That's not something that comes from the heart, it comes from without. Hi, Alan. Man, and I thought you only came in a costume. My real name is Torsten. Yeah, well... shit happens. - That's true. Yeah... Are you coping somehow? What? - I was wondering if you were coping. If I'm coping in here? What do you think? Hey, dude! I'm a bird! You can't just lock me up in here! What am I supposed to do here in this cage? Who do you think you are? What am I supposed to do in here? What am I supposed to do here? - It's alright... Fuck off, you. Fuck off! Music videos are only his hobby. This is his daily life. Dip into Lux's world. Here you see the latest videos. Today: crime fighting in the junk yard. LUX CATCHES DRUG DEALER But this is only the beginning. Take part in Lux's incredible story. Coming soon. Only here... An anonymous tip? Seriously? You installed extra cameras there. And here I was wondering how the cops got there so fast! Does he know? Does he, Jan? Damn it! Brandt thinks it's about time Torsten had a moment of success. A moment of success? - Yes. He's sent his buddy to jail! - Yes. Yes! - Yes, superheroes are best identified by their fragile moments. Only Torsten isn't some character from a stupid comic! What about Alan? I thought he was in on it. I had no idea they'd plant something on him. - But they did, Jan. And now he's in jail. This isn't scripted anymore, it's real! Yes, we're all man-eaters! Fuck you, man! Fuck you! - At least he'll make it through the winter! It's better than being out in the cold. Maybe he'll even get off the alcohol. - You know what? This whole crap? I want nothing more to do with it. Lina... - No! You think that chick will cause trouble? - No, I sorted it all out with her. Are you sure? Yes. So you have everything under control? I need an advance. Excuse me? Thanks to you the project nearly went bust. Lina paid for most of the equipment. Are you trying to blackmail me? Go and pester your daddy. He'll give it to you from the petty cash. I can sort it out by myself. Give me one reason to do this. Just one. Your friend sprung for a full hour. I'm to clear my head. So let's see... So what's your name? - Right now I'm Kitty. Were you at the circus for long? Yes. Why? Come here, you. Why do you do it anyway? What? - That... job. It's just like "Pretty Woman". I'm waiting for my prince. In there? Yes. No, man. I do it to make money. Yeah, sure, but you could easily do something else. You don't really need this. - I see... I just dance there. Is that a problem for you? No, not at all! - Great, nor for me. I chose this! It's a hundred times better than most other jobs, at a bank or an insurance company. I cheat no one. The guys know it's just an act. It's all just show. You're familiar with that. Kitty, just wait a moment... Kitty? You can find Kitty in there. Between 10 pm and 3 am. Torsten, come over here, please. Message one. Today, 5:11 am. Yes, it's Rüdiger. Torsten, report to my office at once. Message two. Monday, 5:30 am. Yes, it's Rüdiger. Torsten, if you're sick, it'd be really kind of you to inform me. Message three. Sunday, 2:10 pm. Message four. Friday, 4:07 pm. Torsten, my boy... Don't worry. Everything's fine. It's just that I'll be in the hospital on Frankfurter Allee over the weekend for a routine check-up. I'll get back to you. Take care. Press green. I'm looking for Mrs. Kachel. - First name? Luise. I'm her son. I'm sorry. Your mother isn't staying in any of our rooms at present. Are you sure she's here with us? She told me so herself on my answering machine this Friday. I was busy. - One moment. Could you show me your ID, please? I'm very sorry, Mr. Kachel, your mother passed away two days ago. It is rather strange. You should have been informed by now. I'm sorry. As a child he was an always-radiant bundle of joy. A real sunshine. But one time, he must've been... about 3 or 4, I had to go to hospital, and he had to stay at his grandma's. He cried all the time. "Where's my mommy? Where's my mommy?" Until Grandma had enough and told him, "Your mommy is in hospital getting a new baby. A really sweet one. Not a cry-baby like you." Yes. And ever since that time... he's been such a serious little man. SUPERHERO LUX BRINGS REAL ESTATE SCAM TO LIGHT You do know we're renovating next week? We'll dispose of everything that's still here after 9 am... at your cost. Be glad we're renovating it completely, or you'd have to redecorate. But this way it should be doable, right? - Yes. Promise me you'll take some time for yourself. Why did you leave us? I got a job. Regular pay. I go to the children's hospital in Lichtenberg once a week. To read them stories, do some crafting, play with them, even sing sometimes. I mean, some kids never receive visitors. I'm sure they'd be overjoyed, if a superhero were to drop by. If you felt like it. The fact that we carry a superhero inside us doesn't make it any easier. You have to tell yourself, "I will go the way of the warrior. I will do it for the good cause." You have to tell yourself that every day or it's all over very quickly. So? I think he needs more time. This thing with his mother's upset him badly. That chick is interfering with our plans. I feel it could do him good. Don't go there, okay? We have enough good Samaritans as it is. No one wants to see bald kids at prime time who won't survive until next week's episode. Stay on it now or it was all for nothing. I just need two or three more phat shots, no more. Turn that fucking thing off! If our first teasers go viral, we'll be overrun with requests. Then we'll start producing big time. So don't mess it up now! At least stay on the ball with Kitty. She'll take his mind off things. Hi, Mike. Did Kitty take the day off? - No, she's gone out for a smoke. - Okay. Oh, man. Torsten. I think she's in the dressing room. Let's go there. The rolls. - Piss off. Let go, asshole! You're trespassing! Give that to the fucking homeless! Alright, stop it! Alright. Everything's alright. Fucking costume. Are you okay? - Yeah... It'll be okay. Get a cab. My treat. Shit. Message one. Today, 4 pm. Hi Torsten, it's Jan again. Hope you're okay. Let's talk tomorrow. We can stop filming for a while, if you like. No problem. Have a good night's sleep first, okay? See you. Hey... I... I don't know how to begin. It must sound crazy to you. You probably hate me right now. And I understand. I needed money urgently and... Berk... My boss, he... he suggested that he and I... But now he wants me to do it with customers too, and... if I refuse... I... well... I thought that maybe if Lux... I'm sorry, it was a stupid idea. Peek-a-boo! Sit down quietly. Hands on the table. Aren't you the guy from the video? I think it's awesome what you do. People are beside themselves over you. Respect! The way you put your neck on the line. It's amazing that there are still people out there who do things for others. Just like that. See that they get justice done. It's not to be taken for granted. Take me, for instance. I was born and raised here and built this up by myself. I've always paid my taxes. Always. Then, suddenly, I'm an African pig. Not very pleasant. So you have to watch out. Suddenly everyone has something to moan about your face. African pig. What are you doing in my office anyway? I have information that your girls are forced into prostitution. Have a look. All my girls have been properly reported and registered. I pay their income taxes. And I pay them more than the usual wages. All of them. Those who don't want to work here, can leave. And if one of the ladies insists on offering extra services, that's up to her. Want one too? Was it her who told you? She was the first who wanted to offer extra services. At first I thought she did it for the money. For her daughter. But... Here! She almost lost custody over drugs once. Ah well... I saw you in the car. She made eyes at me. Gave me some crap about being lonely, you know what I'm talking about. I felt sorry for her somehow. I completely fell for it. I was 300 bucks lighter afterwards. - 300 bucks? - Yeah. Fuck it. Can't prove it anyway. Got me into the car and away from my cameras. Come with me. Come on. Sorry. She's completely high again. Look after her. It'll do her good. I'm sure she's pining for love too. I'll pay her for the hour, but then she has to go. I let her get away with it too often. Right. Lux? Lux... Hey, where were you today? The kids drove the entire ward crazy, and you never showed up. What was that for? I wasn't even conscious. What? - Did you spike my drink so you could have some fun? I trusted you, man! I can't explain it. That's not me. Who else can it be? Kitty, you have to believe me, I... I can't remember. Are you into this stuff? That's not me. Please believe me. It isn't me, Kitty. It isn't me! Please... - You sick bastard! The door's open. Torsten? Oh, shit. Torsten? Let me see. What happened? The photographs... Fuck! Berk spiked her drink. She was out cold. And then...? I mean... - No idea. It's all a blank. This is the last thing I remember. Hey. Are you there? I... I don't know how to begin. But you'd never do something like this! No. But maybe Lux would. Fuck. Torsten, I'll talk to her. What's the point? It's no use. There's something... I don't even know her name! Simone. Simone is her name. Simone Florin. Simone Florin... That's a beautiful name. Yes. Let's go. - Where? I'll be in touch later, Torsten. Excuse me, what are you doing here? - Dismantling. Fuck! Torsten? Grab the costume and get out of here. Yes. I need... Hey, come in. - Thanks. Oh, Marine, not the script. Mommy has to learn her lines first. Shit! - What's wrong? I don't believe it! What the...? Shit... No... No, no, no! - Do you really think...? What does it look like? But the strap's been... Shit. Maybe someone found him in time. Or maybe not. In that case the police would be here, or an ambulance... anything! Well? Hey, wait... isn't that a production van? Give me the monitor. I don't believe it! What the...? Dude... what's going on here? Is Torsten with you? - No. Yeah, sure. What are you doing? - Lina, this isn't funny, okay? Are you crazy? - It just isn't... Is there a problem? No. Not at all. Well? - My mailbox. - Torsten? - No, Brandt. What? What is it? He's showing a rough cut of the ending on Friday. There'll be an afterparty. Did he mention Torsten? - No. He just said, everyone's coming. Let's hope so. What ending? Torsten? Please. You were right about everything. He spiked both our drinks. Then he put on your costume and... I'm so sorry I didn't believe you. Please! I almost thought you were going to let me hang out to dry. Don't worry. We'll get the bastard. Forget Kick-Ass. This is real! Lux and Kitty, Warriors of Light. Get ready to join the two of them, as they free Berlin's streets of all darkness. Because true heroes aren't born, they are shaped by life. Dear friends and colleagues, what you just saw has never been seen before. The number of clicks on the teasers have gone through the roof. The response on the Net is sensational! Which means, we'll start shooting this fall! And not some gay Berlin crap, we're doing it Hollywood-style! But this... unbelievable success wouldn't have been possible without two very special people. Ladies and Gentlemen, please welcome Lux and Kitty, Warriors of Light! Now party, you hobos! Shit. Torsten! That's Jan. He discovered Lux and developed him together with Brandt. Hi, I'm Oliver. Great format. Look forward to it. And it's great fun no one knows it's me. Jan, great you could make it. Got a moment? - Where's Torsten? No idea, but I invited him. - What is all this shit anyway? Mr. Kachel passed up an unique opportunity. I made him a more than serious offer for the season, but he declined. So now Oliver Korittke's doing it? It could be anyone behind the mask! He said so himself! The private shots will be pixilated. It'll be awesome, like a secret identity. - You can't be serious! You've exploited Torsten's whole life! - Oh, yeah? The guy roams the streets of Berlin in a self-made costume, so don't tell me he doesn't want to be seen! I made Torsten to what he wanted to be. - Only he never knew! That's exactly what makes it authentic. - Torsten believes that he raped the woman he loves. - So he wouldn't put it past himself! What's going on here? Am I supposed to get drunk by myself? - Now chill. See you Monday in the office. Have a beer. Cheers. - Champagne? Absolutely! You haven't seen Torsten either, have you? - What? It's a real pity he's not taking part anymore. The fucking bastard! - What? What is it? Here, on the hard drive, apartment, living room... Oh, man! Shit. Oh, no. - No! No, no, no! What? - It just breaks off. Go on, check the next clip. I'm starting to get in a very bad mood! - He hanged himself! - Do you believe everything you see on TV? - So what is it? - A bit of "Truman Show". You know that crazy shit. - What? - Dude, what's wrong? Why does the long shot break off? - No idea. Battery empty? Bullshit! This is Torsten. His hand is bandaged. Later it's someone else. One more time. Your friend backed out. We shot the ending with Oliver. What've you done with him? What have you done with him? What? - Have you gone completely mad? We've been looking for Torsten everywhere. Not a trace. Nothing! You're completely paranoid! - You got rid of his body to save your fucking project! Admit it! - Dude! Jan! Admit it, for God's sake! - We've got nothing on him! I have the hard drive! Mr. Brandt? - Run, Marek, run! Get out of here! So. THE REAL LUX MISSING Torsten's been missing for over a week. No one has seen or heard from him since. We've absolutely no idea where he could be. There's no trace of him. I've gone through each and every film clip. There's no proof against Brandt. And... I secretly hope we're mistaken because... So if you see Torsten anywhere or you've maybe met him someplace, let us know. We just want to know he's okay. And that we didn't just... And... And, Torsten, if you're anywhere out there, we're so very sorry... about everything. I never thought Batman could really fly.
