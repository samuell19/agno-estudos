I am not insulting yöu... this is a fight with myself. O Lord! May I die on my feet, not on my knees. Abdul Khaliq was Pakistan's pride. The fastest runner in Asia. Milkha couldn't wait to see him run. The next day he was to run against him. I'm grateful to my countrymen and to Coach Javed. Salaam! - Thanks. Javed sir. yöur boy ran well. Congratulations. - Thank yöu. Bravo! yöu ruled the field. Thank yöu, sir. This is Milkha Singh. India's 400m champion athlete. Hello, sir. yöu're competing in the 200m race. All the best. To yöu too. Watch out. Watch out, Khaliq. I hear yöu ran away from Pakistan... have been running ever since, huh? Now yöu need to show yöur magic in 200m as well. Come. We've seen dozens like Milkha. We have two choices... leave our village and go to the new India. Or change our religion as they ask. We shall not eat cow's meat! They can behead us, but we will never change our religion! Prepare to fight then. When Guru Govind Singh left Anantpur Sahib... and reached Garhwal fort... . he had only 40 Sikhs with him. While the enemy were a million! Guruji dressed his sons in armour... ...and sent them to battle. His forty men fought hard. They fought a mighty army. How will we fight? They have weapons, horses... And us? What do we have? Enough of bravado! Thousands are leaving for India... we should go too. A sparrow will challenge an eagle, A sparrow will challenge an eagle, A lamb will fight a lion, One man will fight a million. Guru Govind Singh, bless us! A sparrow will challenge an eagle, A lamb will fight a lion, One man will fight a million. Guru Govind Singh, bless us! Come on. Milkha. Are yöu alright, son? Jai Hind sir. Today, yöu won't salute us, we salute yöu. The whole unit salutes yöu. India salutes yöu. Proud. Milkha, yöu are an officer now. No. All because of the pat on my back and a kick on my butt from yöu sir. Stay well, my son. I wish yöu a thousand joys. yöu have made me happy. Congratulations to his friends! Many many congratulation for Milkhas winning. Let's celebrate! Bite through the electric fire Chew the metal's vibrating current Set aflame yöur every pore Without burning yöurself there's no glow The flames are burning Milkha Run Milkha Run Milkha Excuse me. Can I have a photograph please? Of course. Thank yöu. Son, yöu have made us proud. Now make India's flag flutter high at the Rome Olympics. The hopes of all India ride on yöu. I will run like my life depends on it. Wonderful. Son, what can we do for yöu? Panditji, if I win, can yöu declare a national holiday? Of course. A call from Pakistan. Gentlemen. Excuse me, please. - Yes. Ladies and Gentlemen. An important announcement... what a coincidence that while yöu are all here and... Pakistan's President, Field Marshal Ayub Khan has called. He has accepted my proposal of the lndo-Pak friendship games. It's an important step toward friendship... between our two nations. I would like... Milkha Singh to lead our contingent... to Pakistan. All eyes were on Milkha. But there was a storm brewing in Milkha's head. Milkha, run! Run! Why are yöu standing here? Son. Son. Listen to me... don't be scared. No harm will come to yöu. Don't be scared. Son, be brave. yöu'll be fine. Run, Milkha! Run! Get out of here. Run, Milkha! Run! Don't turn back to look! So, Pakistan is a terrible memory for Milkha... and we have come to revive those memories. We have reached Chandigarh. We've reached. But what shall we say to Milkha? yöu have a nice garden. It seems gardening interests yöu. Seems so. It has suddenly turned cold in Chandigarh hasn't it? yöu're right. Thank yöu. Sir, sugar? - One spoon. Thank yöu. So much sugar, Milkha? It's not good for yöu. Oh! That's mine... yöu aren't here to discuss the weather and sugar. Milkha, Nehruji wants to meet yöu. I can't do it sir. My feet won't move. My family's blood is in that air, I won't be able to breathe. Son... yöu're a soldier. yöur country needs yöu now. If yöu must wage war with yöur own self for it... then yöu should. Right now, it's important. Peace and harmony must prevail between our countries. Sports are an important means to that goal. That's all very well, sir... but why won't Milkha Singh meet the press? What's the problem? Did he rebuff Khaliq's challenge? Why the empty chair? He knows coming to Pakistan... is a mistake. Mr. Khaliq, can yöu defeat him? God willing But where is Milkha Singh? Everyone, please sit down! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Why are yöu crying? Crying is no good. Don't cry. yöur photo... Is this yöu? Red is the maiden's veil... Red are tomatoes... Red like Sampreefs butt! Milkha's butt. Sampreet! Milkha. I thought yöu were... I Survived... I Survived... People aren't bad, Milkha. But circumstances can make them bad. Partition was a bad time. Remember our Muslim teacher... he raised me and got me married. Some milk? yöu love it I'm told. - Yes, sister-in-law. Aren't yöu the Milkha Singh who runs? I am... the one who runs. The connections are done, start the radio. Hey, change the station. Just a minute. Just by looking at the Gaddafi stadium in Lahore... it seems as though entire Pakistan has turned up... in India everyone's heart is beating faster. We can see the planes throwing colour in the skies... and General Ayub Khan of Pakistan... is entering the stadium in his magnificent cavalcade. yöur Excellency, good morning. - Welcome to Pakistan. Thank yöu, sir. - All the best. Same to yöu, sir. - Sir. All the best. - Thank yöu, sir. Best of luck. - Thank yöu, sir. All the best. - Thank yöu, sir. All the best, Milkha Singh. - Thank yöu, sir. Khaliq. Pakistan's hopes are riding on yöu. I will do my best. All the best. - Thank yöu, sir. And the tension is building. It's as if everyone is breathing together, or rather everyone has stopped breathing. Leave them far behind yöu. No one can defeat yöu. No, Milkha. yöu're the best. yöu're the champ. Squad.. Go, my lion! Run! Go, son. Do it. Yes. Milkha Singh. This could be the last race of yöur life. That's how I'll run it. On yöur mark. There is absolute silence... everyone's eyes are on the race track. Who will win? India's hope Milkha Singh... or Pakistan's star athlete, Asia's tornado, Abdul Khaliq. Squad... The gun is fired and the race has begun. Pakistan's Abdul Khaliq is leading the pack... looks as though he has decided to come and win today. He seems to be reaching his goal effortlessly. Without a care, without a worry, he is running towards the finish line. Looks like his feet are about to kiss victory. Come on. - Come on, son. But wait a minute! Something else is happening here... Milkha Singh is suddenly catching up... and one by one he is leaving everyone behind! And with such ease he has now overtaken Pakistan's Abdul Khaliq! This can only be called a miracle which we may not ever get to witness again. It seems as though Milkha Singh has grown wings... the wind is carrying him forward... or he is running above the clouds. Come on, Milkha. Throw off all yöur cares and troubles The skeletons of the past The soles of yöur feet are like horse shoes yöu've got to do it come what may yöu are fire Milkha Hail Mother India! To celebrate Milkha Singh's glorious victory in Pakistan... I propose a public holiday in this honour. Milkha has planted the Indian flag! He's done it! No one has ever run like yöu did today. yöu didn't run my son, yöu flew. From now on the world will know yöu as... 'The Flying Sikh.' Pakistan bestows this title upon yöu... with pride and honour. Well done, my boy. Well done. "Hope You've Liked & Enjoyed The Movie" The world is lashing out at yöu. Welcome the battle cry. yöur arms are like oars. Feet that raise an uproar yöur every vein is iron ore. yöu are fire Milkha. Now yöu run Milkha Now yöu run Milkha, run Milkha, run run run run run Milkha O rod of steel O boat O rod of steel. Turn around the tides of fire O boat, yöur glory lies in sinking Now yöu run Milkha Now yöu must rise Milkha yöu are fire Milkha Now awaken Milkha yöu are fire Milkha Now yöu must run Milkha The field is yöur cradle. Cover it with yöur splendour The mountains are at yöur head Drape the entire sky Tie the turban of resolve Milkha yöu are fire Milkha. Tear open the wheels of that chariot. Turn it into the divine disc. Bind well the laces of war. The lion has emerged from his lair Fire the bullet Milkha Now yöu must run Milkha Now awaken Milkha Now awaken Milkha yöu are fire Milkha Bite through the electric fire Chew the metal's vibrating current Set aflame yöur every pore Without burning yöurself there's no glow The flames are burning Milkha Now awaken Milkha yöu are fire Milkha
