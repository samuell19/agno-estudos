-Nagamani biryani is fantastic. -Chilled beer and chicken are a super combination. -Drink slowly, man. -We still have beers, right? -Boss! -Give the gun here. -I’m coming, boss. Our Goddess Bala Tripura blessed us after so long. She gave us the wealth we could never expect. This is going to change the fate of our village. Yes dad, it is all your good heart and luck of our village. -What happened? -Wait dad, I’ll take a look. What happened? Sir! Young master! What happened? Hey! What happened? Son! Son! What happened? Come on, speak! His name is Radha. His criminal history is bigger than any faction story. Lives of few others are going to change with the crime he did now. -Hey, driver escaped. -You first search for the diamonds. Huh, where did this old man keep? Is it in this pocket? You think these? -Oh no, diamonds! -Diamonds! -Yes, diamonds! -Boss, we got the diamonds. -Yeah! We did it, man. Super! -Boss, we brought the diamonds. -Yes! Their names are Karan and Johar. They acted loyal for so long and today backstabbed their boss. Let’s see how are their lives going to change from now. Boss! Boss! -Is he dead? -Yes, he’s dead. -Boss! -Boss! -Take leave. -Diamonds are ours. -Bless us boss. Bye boss, rest in peace. Where is your boy, dude? -He must be here by now, wait please. -Hey, your Ex is coming. Oh no, damn! What rascal, I’m behind you from one year and it seems you are with some other guy now? Brother, I saw her going in different cars every day. You wait, man. Is he such a big hero? He is born with golden spoon. You and your gang will move aside by seeing him. Ok, I’ll see. I’ll look into even that. Come on, man. Go away, man! Hey look there, he is coming. -Wow! -There he is. -So cool! -Hey! -How cute? -Hi honey! -Hi sweet heart! -Sorry to make you wait. -It is ok! -So, here are my friends. -Oh! -Rhea! -Hi! -Hello! -And Nisha! -Hello! -Hello! -Shall we move? -Hey mechanic! -Oh no! -What? -It is so hot, right? -Hey Mechanic, I’m calling you. No, not us! -He is not born with golden spoon. He is born with a wrench. -Stop, man! Didn’t you still get it, baby? He is a mechanic. -What? -Mechanic, haha! His name is Rishi. He is a mechanic. Though his life is filled with wrenches and repairs, his dream is to make a rich girl flat and settle in life. There’s no count of his failed plans and he has no luck for girls. You give build up by using the branded cars given for repair and try for my girl, rascal? Boss, when shall such girls see us when we come on bicycle or a scooter? Thus, I wanted to try by bringing the branded cars. -Anyway, you guys carry on. -Hey! -You cheat! Look bro, when so many boys fight for a girl it looks very bad. -Leave me, guys! -No way we’re leave. Bash him up! -Hey! -Beat him up! Hey, stop! We got him. Let’s bash him up. What’s this fellow, man? Hey, beat him up. Don’t leave that idiot. Come on, idiot. Come out. Hey!

Fifty crores! -Fifty crore? -Start the vehicle, fast. -Keep it in the back seat. -I will! Start the vehicle, come on start. Start it, man. What’s wrong with him? Start it. -What’s wrong? -It is not starting. -What? Is it not starting? What to do now? -Why, at this time? -Go, man! -Hey! -Who are you, idiot? -Any problem? -Vehicle isn’t starting. What’ll you do? -Ok, shall we start it? -You? Ok, start it. -Open the bonnet. -Who is he? Is it done so fast? -Yes, start it now. -Wow, you are no ordinary guy. -Bro, please! -Wait, I’m giving.

I’m still bearing with you as you know English though you don’t wear uniform. A guy working really wouldn’t be like you. -Then how would he be? -Wait, I’ll show how he’d be. -He has to say. -Yes, he should say that. I’ll show what I am today. He’s dead in my hands today. A worker should be like this. -Huh! -Go idiot, you are high in ego and low in work. This is more for you. -Hey stop! -Hey Jump! Pull that back one. Yes! -Go on! Are you drunk while driving, idiots? Who are they looking like fools? Why are they driving zigzag on road? You saw their idiotic deeds, right? Their names are Trump and Jump. These are the guys going to make Rishi’s entire life take U-turn now. -Hey move! -No problem even if you dash, careful. Who are you rascal, blocking our way? Hey who are you and what is this driving? -Hey man, not me but ask him. I said over speed is dangerous. -I said no. Thus got furious and showed by driving. So, tell him if needed. Why me? I thought over speed is dangerous for me and not for him. -Dangerous for both, right? -Why do you say two when three are here, rascal? Do you know driving at all? Don’t I know driving? Do I not look like a mechanic for you? All escaped on the road though we came over speeding. -They know driving. -You couldn’t escape. That means you don’t know driving. -What are you talking, rascal? -On whom are you putting hands? (Clamouring) Rishi, I’m at the botanical garden. Two fools are beating me up here. Tear all his clothes, come on tear. Looks great, dude! -Hey dude! Where are they? -They left. Hey, was the fight hard? Still, this day is not good for us. Owner idiot messed with me in the morning and this for you now. Fine, this car should be delivered in Trident hotel. Will that owner idiot come and pick it after going there? Owner is not in city and won’t be back for four days, it seems. Then why not come and pick then? Does he fear we’d use this up till then? Not fear idiot, it is confidence. He should have that. -Ok, go and park this in that cellar. -Ok! -There is a briefcase in, take that and keep in room number 1621. -Ok! -Lock it carefully, give the keys in reception. -Ok! Come back to shed without going anywhere. We should go to hospital. -You don’t get me into such dirty fittings again. -No dude, listen! Wow! It is so good! Bah, damn! What’s in this? You beauty! My size, it will fit. -Good morning sir! -Nice door! Wow! Is this a hotel or Taj Mahal? Namaste, how can I help you sir? -Alright, this way sir. -Thanks! Whatever, five star hotel look is different. Hah! First time in life! -Oh, damn! -Damn, waste fellow! Lip lock in lift! It is thrilling just to think of it. Why are all doors the same? Yes, this one. Wow, babies! I’m coming. Oh no, this fellow has stocked enough for an year. Hah, champagne! One should have luck. Enough! Bedroom should be like this. Wow, this view is great. Super! Wow, this guy seems to have opened up a branded shop all together. It is great. How many cars should I repair to stay in such a hotel? Anything must be in fate. Huh! Pack up! Huh! I kept everything correct, right? My job is done. Even this door understood it is not mine. I’m leaving. Thank you, sir. Go idiot, go! You are high on ego and low in work. This is more for you. Owner is not in city and will not return for four days. Ok sure, we will arrange it. -Yeah! -Hey, I forgot something in the room. -Oh, that’s ok sir. -Thanks. -My pleasure! I’ll start with you. Aren’t there any chairs around? -Oh no, why is she like this? -Excuse me! -May I sit here? -Yeah, please! -Thank you. -She’s great like top end Rolls Royce car. -Hello!

Control! -Thank you! -My pleasure. -Hey dude! -Dude, where are you? -I’m in heaven. -Heaven, when did you die? You idiot, I’m in a star hotel. There’s a girl like angel before me. -Is it? Are you saying the truth, dude? -Where is this girl? Hello! Hello dude, are you there or dead in real? -Hari, she’s gone. -Where did she go? -Excuse me sir. -Please sit. Oh no, I’m floor manager sir. My name is Bhadram. Oh, floor manager? I thought you were rich like me by seeing your getup. What am I rich, sir? You are so funny. My monthly salary is just fifty thousand rupees including everything sir. Damn, my black boss isn’t paying me even half of that. -Sir, would you like to order something? -Yeah! -This drink is good, get one more. -Who is that, man? -It is Bhadram my friend, working as manager in this star hotel. -Sir! Hey wait, I’ll just call you back. What happened? -You said me as a friend? -Yeah! Sir, my life is not equal to your car tire. I drive so many cars, which car tire? How will I know rates of those car tires and GSTs, sir? You are a Billionaire. -Yeah, I’m a Billionaire right? -Yeah! Anyway, glass and plate shouldn’t be empty. -Bring a plate of each item. -Ok! -But, bill it to the room. -Ok! Got it my friend? Go, then! Friend, again? -Go dude! -Even my friends never called me dude. You’re real friend, sir. No idea how he lives on. Where did this girl go? Good if that Rolls Royce I missed yesterday is seen again. -Oh no! -Happy birthday to you, madam! Happy birthday to you, madam! Sir, good morning sir! Oh, thank you! -Sir! -Bhadram! -Sir! What’s that celebration? -Celebrating clients’ birthdays is a formality in our hotel, sir. -Oh! -Fine, do you have a pen? -Sir! Not just pen, I’d give even my life if you ask sir. Your crazy love! Give a pen for now. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you so much! Thank you so much! Thanks! -Hi, I’m Rishi. -Sri! -You should tell me a truth. -What is that? -Today is your birthday. -Yes! -Your happy birthday. -Yes! -But are you happy? -I’m happy. See, you are thinking means you are lying. Look, birthdays come once in a year, there’s no meaning in celebrating such birthdays if we are not happy even on that day. So, what should I do? If you give me one hour, I’ll show you what the real happiness is. Madam, say yes. Sir is our premium client. Very kind too, say yes madam. Say yes!

Why isn’t there any news about his dead body smell or death celebrations anywhere? Has he been to any election campaign to be in news? He’s dead. -It’s a corpse in the hills and some foxes might be eating it by now. -Correct! Brother is up! -Did he get up? -Brother! -Are you alive, brother? -You thought I died? -No bro! -Who are you, man? -I’m the Doctor, sir. You look like a guy delivering the buffaloes and how come you are a Doctor? -Did you buy or read? -I studied sir. Where is the dress? -By the time I dressed up, your people by force… -Hey! -No sir, they brought me with respect. -Yes! What is my condition now? -According to MRI scan… -Hey, this rascal is… -Say it in Telugu. -That is… Hey, will you say or should I shoot you down? -Sir, that is… No idea how to say that? -Say with your mouth, idiot. -Hey! -Brother! -Who put off the lights? Brother, lights are on and fans are revolving. -Are lights on and fans revolving? -Yes, brother. Then why can’t I see anything? Why is everything dark for me? -That’s the bad news I’m going to say sir. -Bad news, what is that? -Now, as you had a strong blow on the back of your head… -Ok! -Nerves supplying Oxygen to your eyes… -Hey, Telugu! Nerves giving life gas are damaged. Thus if you get angry or excited, your sight weakens and you lose the sight. You rascal, what to do now? Do something, guys. Here, press this ball slowly.

That’s all. -Cheers! -Cheers! -Is it good? -Yeah, good! -Say now. -What to say? -Say about yourself. -What’s there to say about myself? Shall I say? Your dad is a big Billionaire. He wants to make you the boss to all his companies. But you like travelling like the present generation girls. Thus, you travel alone like this. Am I right? -You are saying like you saw it all? -Of course! You gathered information well about me. You are a genius. -They say the same even at my shed. -What? -I mean, they say the same in my head office too. -Oh, I see! You said well about my passions. What about my likes? How will I know about your likes? I hate cheating and those doing it. I just hate them. -Sorry, sorry! -I’m fine. Shall I say about you now? -Highly impossible. -Let me guess. You have export businesses in many countries. Are you kidding me? They want to do an arranged marriage for you at your house. But, you want to marry someone you like. Huh! Amazing!

You backstabbed me calling as boss. -Shot in my heart, rascals. -Brother! Your eyes in anger… Control! What to control, idiot? What to control? Though you think cruel like a gangster, your talks must be soft like a saint. -Oh, peaceful! Hail to peace! Like this? -Exactly, sir. Bullet will come out from your mouth. I can’t do this duel role. I can’t do it, these rascals… -Say where are the diamonds. Or else, I’ll shoot you down. -No please! Bullet will go into the wall from your head. His anger is high. Give the ball. Press this. -Relax! -Hey Johar, it seems he gets sight back by pressing the ball. -Let’s instigate him, make him go blind and escape. -Ok! -Yes, slowly like that. -Hail to peace! -Where are the diamonds? -Hail to peace, we don’t know boss. -Hail to peace, where are the diamonds? -Crow took them, boss. -Idiot! -Hey give respect, otherwise you bald idiot! Anyone would go blind with lust and why do you go blind in anger? Eyes are big and would go blind for this bald rascal. -No, I can’t bear this now. -Cool! I’ll shoot you down. Yes! -Hey Jungly! -Brother! -Why is the gun not shooting? -It is locked, brother. -You should say that in advance, rascal. -Where is the ball? -Where is the ball? -Yes, I got it. -Oh no, brother what you caught is… Hey, don’t tell. Let him think that is the ball. -He’d kill us both if he comes to know they took away the ball. -Yes, true! -What are you whispering? -Nothing sir, press it slowly. -Press it slowly. -Otherwise you won’t get your sight back. -Sir, are you able to see? -Slightly! -Then leave the ball. -Why?

I should find if there’s ball anywhere in this hotel and buy it. Oh no, where is it? We planned and escaped great. We should do something and go away from here. His life is become a ball in our hands. Will he get his sight by pressing this? -His disease is strange. -What about our money in the room? Not one or two, fifty crores. How can we let go after so much of hard work? -Johar, we should do some magic and escape with that money. -Correct! Oh no, they came again. Honey, I’ll show you a super view. Come here. -Where? -Here, come on! -What shall we do now? -Let him come out from room first. -Here! -Where are we going, baby? -Background is great, let’s take a good selfie. -Oh, here? -Ok! -Yeah! Smile! Yes! -See, it is so good. -That’s nice. -Come here! -You are so good, you know? -Hey! -What’s this in five star hotel? -Why not take a room? He is really fallen for me. I can now settle rich. They don’t seem to leave me. I should somehow tell the real truth before they reveal. Oh God, he squeezed badly. We let them go like fools, though we had them in hands. No brother, let’s chop them into pieces once we get the diamonds. -What are you walking lazily behind? -We are following you, brother. -Go and search there. -Come guys! -You come! Oh no! Come on, let’s go this way. -Oh God! -This way! -Come, let’s go this way. -Come on! They don’t seem to leave me for sure. Why are you behind me, idiots? -They’d be somewhere here, catch them. -Ok, brother. Hey move. Come behind. -It is not so easy to escape. -I’ll tell you when to catch. -You always plan right? -Hey, stop! -Hey Johar, move! he saw us. -Catch! -You ruined it rascal. -Johar! They escaped again. Oh no! Jungle idiot, you ruined it. Anyone would catch from behind, why did you go from front and fall down so, rascal? How will I know there are so many plans in your brain? Shut up, you are a big fool. I’m bigger fool to believe in you. They escaped again. You are of no use to me. You nasty rascal! I can listen. Doctor, ball! Oh no, again? Ball is with him. -Oh no! -Why did you put the ball in bag? It may slip if separate. Why did the ball size come down? Size shrunk as you’d been squeezing it, sir. Oh no, is it not comfortable brother? Why not, I got the feeling of squeezing two when I’m squeezing one. Hey, I’m getting my sight back. Is it back, sir? Then let go the ball slowly. Is your sight back? Yes, see now. Yes, relax! Relax! I got my sight back, guys. Come on, let’s go and catch. Come on! Doctor, tennis ball may grow to volley ball size for brother’s squeezing. We should definitely buy two smiley balls. You said it well, come on let’s be on that job. -I’m very tensed, dude. -I completely understood the matter, dude. Don’t worry, say the matter carefully to her and convince, dude. -What shall I tell? -Say the truth. Then not just those idiots, no idiot can do anything to you. All the best! Dude, high five! Go, idiot! -Move, man. -Will we get in restaurant? -They’d be somewhere around here. -Hey! -Brother, let’s see in this restaurant. -Ok! -Hey, what are you doing here? -Brother is here. -Search all over. -We are meeting probably, wait a second. -Oh no! -Thank God. -Why did you sit? Go and search. -Wait! Can I have a shot? -Hey, Doctor! -Sir! -Should I say you separately? Go and search. -No need sir! Yeah! -Nice, right. -Ok, ok! Oh no! Darling, why are your eyes so tired? You never let me sleep the whole night. You naughty! No idea, it seems I’m doing a lot without my knowledge. -What do you mean? -I don’t understand. -Am I saying wantedly? -I didn’t mean that, baby! I’m angry. You know what I do when I get angry, right? I know, you go to a side alone for 10 minutes. -Is it? -Said it correct. Huh! No idea, it seems I’m doing a lot without my knowledge. I don’t understand at all. Sweet heart! -Sri, I shoul tell you something. -Silence! -Hey, none recognised us. -Correct, let’s go on. -Stop! You seem to be new faces. New joining? -Yes sir! -Don’t we look so? -I recognised as you looked so. Open it up. Hey, what are you opening? Stop! -Coats, man! -Oh coats! Sorry sir. Even mom doesn’t feed without asking. You should serve everything even without asking and get good comments. Why sauce packets, sir? -If customers ask, will you go running and bring? -No! Don’t roam around like stray dogs, use the brains. -Thanks a lot sir. -Save your life and salary. -Ok sir! -Always think big. Think big, my foot! He’s like Stuart little, move.

What are you doing? Hello, what the hell are you doing? -Hey, who are you idiot? -Hey, shut up! -Rishi, please. Idiot, you ruined me saying honey. I’m for your needs and is he for your wants? -When every word from you about me is a lie, why is this given by me in your neck? -Hey! -Damn! -Sri! You are a bloody cheater. Cheater, huh! Oh God! -Oh no! -Who is he? This is my life, right? Who is he to order me to live in a specific way? There’s nothing wrong in searching for my happiness and joy, right? Nothing wrong! You are the only one understanding me correctly in this world, Rishi. Poor girl! -You were saying something? -Oh, yeah! What I wanted to say you was, I’m a… He’s dead now. Let it be anyone, he’s dead in my hands. Hey, who the hell are you man? -My room, right? -Sir, that is... Welcome sir! -What the hell is happening in my room? -Silently sir! -I’ll explain sir. -Hey, stop! You are… I asked your owner to leave the briefcase here and go.

Please! -Baby! -Ok! -Rishi, what nonsense is this? What dude, she’s screaming nonsense and nuisance? Look, enough of this. Close all this show and I want everyone out of my room right now. Sir, you are completely mistaken. He is Mr Rishi, one of the top Billionaires in India. -Stop, man! -He is our premier customer, sir. You might be mistaken with room number, sir. -I’ll help you, please come. -Darling! -Let’s go out and talk. -I just don’t understand. You crazy idiot, this is my room. You understand what you are talking? -You know who I am? -Rishi, I don’t understand. -Sir, he too is a Billionaire. -Send those two out of my room first. -Just a minute. -Ok! Rishi, can’t you just ask him to get out right now? I’m extremely sorry for disturbing your private moments. Just give me a moment, sir. I’ll clear this. -I understand, sir. -Hey, listen to me man. Oh God! There will be many similar rooms in the hotel. Enough of the mess done, please leave now. Baby, I can’t just take it anymore. I’m just leaving. -Sister! -Darling, just listen. Wait! -It’s over. -This is the problem with you. You won’t come when called and won’t stay when you come. -Talk all these outside, go! -One second, one second! You bloody! Do you have any brains, idiot? Who gave you the job? Does he look a Billionaire to you? He is just a Mechanic. -Oh no! -No! It is all over. Mechanic! -Sri, I wanted say you this truth. But you… -No need! I just saw what your real face is. Don’t say so, Sri. I feared you may go away from me if I say the truth. But didn’t think to get close by saying a lie. Now, I don’t need about whatever you think. I loved you with my whole heart. I too liked, but that feeling is gone now. That’s it! Then what about the thing happened in between us? Not just our hearts, even our bodies got close. That was just one night stand, that’s it! -Sri! -Huh! Why are you continuously pointing out his mistakes, like you never did any mistakes? Hey, you wait for two minutes dude. I don’t need about your past. It’s just enough that you are with me. Where, should I be on the road? -Where will you… -Sri, stop! Listen to me -Dude! -I really love you. -Your love is on the road. My heart is looking towards the sky, huh! Sri, please give me one chance. Please! -Don’t waste my time. Just leave me alone. -Sri! If you come with me, I’ll keep you happy for your entire life. If needed, I’ll earn more money for you. I’ll take care of you like a queen Sri. -Sri, don’t leave me. -Oh no, dude! I’ll do whatever you say. Please understand me. Don’t leave me and go, Sri. Please! -Please! -Fine, just one hour! If you can keep me happy, for life long I’ll be with you. Say what should I do for you to be happy. Where do we go? -Shopping! -Oh no! -What? -Shopping! Oh, shopping! Dude, she ruined many big shots. Let go, we don’t need this love and all. Hey, you know the emotion in our friendship for so long. Now understand even the emotion in my love. Oh no, you attacked with sentiment. Ok dude, you go and be on shopping work and I’ll take care of the rest. -Ok! -Fine, you go. -This? -Nice, nice! This, this one! Yes, perfect! -Hey, look at that one. -Hey, you came in time. You take care of that bill. -Fine dude, you go and I’ll take care. -Sri! -Brother, come here. -What? -What is this? -Take and count it all. Huh, my bad time! Oh no! Hey, all the money is going dude. Let it be gone, dude. -Just the last one! -Add even this. -Yup, done! -Amount wasn’t enough for the last item, sir. -Just this is left. Only this is left behind, it seems. Sri, what happened? Why are you leaving? Just five minutes is there in the one hour time I gave you. But five rupees are left with you now. So, did you understand at least now? Life with me is too expensive. You can’t bear me. Now thinking about me… Don’t waste your time. I’ll now show what I’m in this balance five minutes. See! Hi! Ok! -Sri, I’ll arrange more money. -Dude! Hey dude! -Just listen to me once. -Do something and stop her, dude. Don’t ever follow me. Good bye! She’s leaving, dude. Hey dude, she doesn’t need you. But, why is she taking the items you bought her? Though she doesn’t like me, she bought those with great liking. -Let it be. -Not one or two, nine lakhs dude. Forget money, dude. I can’t anyways be with her. Let at least my memories be with her. Hey, you’ve gone mad. Huh! I’ll bring, brother. Yes! All the money I earned by pushing this into silencers from three years is blown away by her in just one hour and shattered all my dreams. Dirty devil! Friend, you are drinking non-stop from one week. What about your health? Stop it, idiots! Say what exactly happened. I don’t understand your confusion. You two have been playing same drama from one hour. -Say it clearly. -Say man, say! Saying stories is a habit for you, right? That day, when I went for car delivery… -Wow, love and romance in the story are superb, dude. -Superb! You believed my stories as truth all these days and first time when I said truth now, you say it as a story, rascals? Correct, yours is not a story and true. What she did is wrong, but what about your deed? Yours too was a mistake, right? I, loving her with full heart is wrong. But there is love in my mistake. -But is there any repentance in her mistake? -No! -No! Hey, hey! -I’m saying now. I’ll make her realise the value of my love. -Yes! -I’ll make her realise that her way is wrong. -Super! -Yeah! -Oh no, my hand. Where is she? -Hey! -Sir! Ok sir! -Madam! -Yes! Sir gave you. Enough of your beauty now, you saw Daniel idiot, right? Meeting him is not an ordinary matter. Oh no, is she here? Oh no! Just watch my show. -Hey, she’s your sister. -We didn’t see anything. -Oh no! -Hey! Yes! -Hey, I can’t! -What, dude? Friend, how much more should I watch? Not again, huh! -What happened? -Tomorrow, 8 PM! -Asked me to come for dinner. -Wow! You are not an ordinary lady. You are dangerous. -Friend, stop! -Dude! I didn’t expect, but you’re cunning. -I’ll go to washroom and come. -Ok, go! Hey, don’t you understand when I said? Don’t follow me, I’m not interested in you. Just get out and just get out of my sight. What get out, idiot? Is this resort your father’s property? Then why are you following me even when I rejected you? Move! If you come in my way, you will be in trouble. I’ll come in your way. Not me, but will make you be in trouble. I’ll prove the way you are going is wrong. -I’ll show what I am. -Oh, I’ll see that. Go away! Hey, lift! Friend, you challenged like Chiranjeevi. -But, we don’t have even a penny, right? -Yes, dude! But, no way I’m going to leave her. -We are not richly in star hotel like then, we are in troubles now. -Yes! Damn! No idea if Prime Minister of a country has so many troubles, but they are draining out my life as the manager of this resort. -How do I manage resort in Kashmir and also this resort in Hyderabad at once? -Manager, my geyser! Hey, this idiot torturing me has come. I’ll call you again. I’m coming, sir. Hey Trimurthulu, has that electrician come? Looks like I’m running this resort just for his geyser. When will that get better? Son, what happened to you? I filled the tank full day before, right? Is this bloody Corona attacking even vehicles? Oh no! Who are you idiot, looking like alien coming from an egg? You knock on my son? Sir, I think your car is under repair. I came to say one of my friends is a mechanic, sir. -Mechanic, does he repair well? -He does super, sir. -Ask him to come. -Dude, come! That is… -Is it ok? -Start it once, sir. Hey son, you are set right. We don’t have a tension now. You did it good, man. Thank you, thank you very much. -Sir, for the help we did to you… -Hey, are you so great to help me? -What is helping a God, man? -Yes! He’s the God in human form taking care of car as his son. Just open your eyes and see for once. Doesn’t that God know we came for jobs? -Hey Lord, show mercy! -Hey, get up! You are giving me trouble. There wouldn’t be so many cars in my resort for you to repair. Good morning, sir. Please welcome, sir! How many of you, sir? We are very honoured to serve you, sir? Sir, would you like to have Indian, Chinese, Italian, French? Ok, you got talent in you. -You three guys are appointed. -Thank you, sir! Hey, stop your build ups like you got some IAS jobs. Friend, how did I see you in suit and boot. How am I seeing you now? Hey dude, don’t look into the sky and remember the past. Those suit and boot have ruined us completely. Hey, that isn’t my past to forget. It is my wound. You both don’t sprinkle spice on that again. You and your sympathy, huh! Sorry sir, I didn’t notice. You are… Server, server, entertainer! What do you want? I should meet Manager sir. -Can you say where is his room? -What is the work? -I came for job interview. -Dude, I think as our assistant. -Yes sir, as an assistant. -Go straight and take left, baby! Ok, thanks sir. To work as my assistant you need lots of ideology. Do you have it? -I’m icon star to ideas, sir. -Is it? Then, we arranged buffet in the party. Public come to eat heavily for buffet. What will you do to get profits instead of them eating so heavily? -Lunch or dinner, sir? -Think, it is lunch. -Veg or Non-veg? -Take Non-veg. Simple sir, plate count should be more and pieces should go less. Interesting, how is that? Those serving should be frustrating and the serving spoons should be small. -Wow, you said it great. -So, is my job confirmed sir? No, not so fast! What will you do with items leftover? Simple sir, all those leftover at lunch will become dinner at night. Wow, very good! Fantastic! -And my job… -You are appointed as my assistant Manager. Thank you sir! -Oh no! Where are your eyes? -I’m sorry. -Oh, is it you? -What is wrong now? Yesterday, you said to show what you are and I’m seeing now.

How dare you play with me? Oh no, madam is getting angry. You laughed when you called me server, right? -Smile like that now. -You are playing with fire. -Oh! -You’ll burn down. Be careful. Who would have been burned down if mirror didn’t break a while ago? I have many works. I’m a server, right? Oh! Hey, did you bring? Did you bring diamonds? Take them out. -Did you bring the diamonds or not? -No! No? Idiot, you know how good was the chance you missed out? No! Oh no, brother got anger again. Rascal you were not brought here to enjoy with your beauty. You missed this chance even after I said to give 10%, which is 1000 crores. -You bloody! -Oh no, I’m Jungly. Madam is to left.

You have no idea what I’m doing here. Hey Doctor, stop! -You are just spoiling it. -Really? Thank you! -Thank you? -Our madam is moving close with him. -Let’s find out what the matter is. -Yes! For God’s sake stop playing with me. What stop playing, idiot? You stop playing with people. That poor old guy first and me the pitiable guy next! Then was that Range Rover guy and now it is this gangster idiot! What exactly is happening here? What is your sketch, rascal? -You! -Oh no! -Box broke! -Oh no, will you kill? -You are doing a big mistake. -What mistake, idiot? I realised what I did for your love was a mistake. I’ll keep blocking till you realise what you are doing is wrong now. -You! Huh! -Oh no! Next time if you follow me, I’m going to kill you right there. -Just get lost. -You get lost. Get lost, it seems! Hey Doctor, something is on in between those two. -You think he got to know about diamonds? -You say so? -Let’s make him reveal it, come on. -Let’s go! -Sir, please sit. -What was the meeting with our madam, idiot? Oh no, nothing so sir. It seems biryani wasn’t tasty and chutney wasn’t sour. -That’s all, sir. -Are you flirting with that reason? -Oh no, what are you saying sir? -Hey, sit! You should rink with us now. We shouldn’t sit and drink with customers, sir. Our manager sir will scold -Who is your Manager idiot? -Manager, my geyser! Sir, I’m coming to you. Let’s go. Hey Manager, your server isn’t doing what we said. Look Rishi, not just me but even customers are Gods. -Do what they say, ok? -Ok sir! -You move, sir! -That’s our power. Come on, sit idiot. Sit! -Doctor, put the glass. -Ok! Arrange the stuff. Hey, you are thinking to make me leak the matter. I’ll play a game with you and pull the matter madam is hiding from me. -Come on, drink. -Someone should say love stories to me when I drink. We have bundles of love stories, you drink. But I’ll whistle if I don’t like the story by chance. -Will you whistle? -What is that? They whistle when they like the story, right? -That’s when not drunk. -Ok, you drink. -Cheers! Hey, you should answer correctly to my question now. Ask idiots, I’ll answer. -Huh, idiot! It’s ok! Say dear, what did you and madam just talk about? You first say me love story, dear. Love story? Then our Jungle will tell that great. Doctor, yeah! Don’t remind that forgotten wound again. I was putting a bait in undergarments at our Attili Subbarayudu river. Baby was washing clothes with Surf on the other side. Looks of us both met. Fish to my bait and babe to my looks were trapped. Babe and fish, it is a great sync my boy. -Hey boy, whistle once for me. -Correct! -Hey no! Hey, leave the hairs. -Oh no! -Who is it, idiot? -What exactly happened? -It is not him. -The same happens if there’s no kick in the story. Hey Farex boy, al; these stories will not work out for us. Let’s genuinely say what happened from one hour before to each other. Doctor sir, you start. -One hour before means, from what happened in that room? -Yes! -Then, you say it. -Ok, see my memory power now. Our madam came to our boss. My boss asked, did you get those diamonds? Madam said, no, sorry. My boss went blind immediately and couldn’t see anything. He thought I was madam, looked at me and said, did I bring you to enjoy with your beauty? He scolded our madam as she couldn’t get ten thousand crores worth diamonds from Daniel idiot. What’s the profit to your madam by doing so? -10%, which is 1000 crores. -Oh! Hey, what’s that like a buffalo sipping? Yes, go on and talk. -Hi baby! -Hi darling! -I was just thinking of you. -Ok, let’s meet now. -Ok, I’m coming. -Yes, go! I’ll see you in a bit. Hello, send the material immediately. It’ll be a problem to us otherwise. No chance to get late. Send it immediately. We shouldn’t get a complaint from there. Don’t you understand when said? -What happened? -Oh no! -What’s wrong? -Who is it rascal? -Hey, it might’ve fallen by mistake. -Hello! -Brother! --I said to send immediately. Why are you still talking? -Oh my God! You hold on. Brother. Who is the manager here, idiot? -Hey, where is the staff? -Sir! Sir! -Sorry sir! -What’s happening here? Is this a resort or not? Doesn’t human life have a value? Will you kill people? -Sorry sir! -You think I’ll be quiet if something happens to my brother? -Extremely sorry sir, it’ll never happen again. -What sorry? -We’re even ready to go to court in this matter if needed. -Hey! What, man? Even a bullet couldn’t do anything to this head. -What’d just a flower pot do? -Yes! -Sorry sir! It is just accidental, leave it. -I don’t know what I’d do if this repeats again. -It’ll never happen again, sir. You planned to steal diamonds from this Daniel. I like your guts. -Hi darling! -Hi Danny! -Give me five minutes. I have to give a gift to someone. -Oh, ok! What’s up man? There is a question mark on your face. Shall I tell what that is? It is how we traced the place you hid within half an hour after you stole the diamonds, right? You know what this is? High secured safe box with GPS tracker made with the most advanced Russian technology. There is tracker to this diamond box you took. It’ll be known in this when this is anywhere at a distance of few hundreds kilometres. You gave a good demo by stealing the box to all my men. -Thus, I’m giving you a gift. -No! Move, rascal. Drown him in to it. Push him in, Push him. Come on! Come on lift him up. Lift him. -Hi baby, how are you doing? -Hi! I’m sorry for the last night. By the way, I’ve a gift for you. Yes, a diamond necklace. -Come on! -Oh! -Did you like it? -Yes! -Biggest deal in my life is happening tomorrow. -Really? -Yes! I want your presence and don’t forget to wear this when you are with me. -Sure, I’ll be there. -Yes! After two days, I’ll be a King. Yes, yes! What madam fire? Madam is glowing. -Diamond necklace for free? -Hey, you mind your language. -You mind your dirty business. Go, idiot! -Don’t worry, sir. -Idiot! -Go! Huh, did you dash again? That’s fine. Why does your face turn black by seeing that girl? -What’s the matter? -Oh no, nothing! Come on! -Sorry for my language. -No problem, go on! Still what would people think when you keep dashing repeatedly? -Go carefully! -Ok! -(Singing a popular song) -Cheers! -Hey Trump, look there. -Shall we dash her? -Let’s dash. -Shall we dash her? -Let’s dash. (Singing a popular song) That escort guy isn’t coming and I gave word to these girls. What to do? He is strong like a bull. He’s perfect for those jackals. -Rishi! -Sir, my duty is over. -Need to relax after duty, take it. -Thank you, sir! There are customers in business suite. They’d give good tip when you give this to them. Enjoy with that. -Sir, what’s this? -Customers are keen about neatness. Go! -That way! -Yes, this way! -Always he’s into some tension. Madam, one strong bull is coming. Enjoy! Oh no! Madam, Manager said to give this Champagne bottle to you. I hope you have a pleasant stay. Thank you so much! Where dear? You’re superb, like a fighting bull. What are you saying? You got some wrong information. Let me go. Hey, your job is just to come. I’m not such a guy. Hey Rishi, why did you come so fast? Why couldn’t you relax a bit? -So, you sent after knowing it all? -Rishi, don’t shout. -Manager, how much more time? -Madam, I’m sending. -One minute! -Leave me! -He’s troubling for that geyser, sir. -You wait baby! Rishi, why do you wish to enter hell again when I arranged both heavens in one room? Sir, I don’t like such dark deeds. Hey, you shouldn’t talk so in this age. Enjoy, my dear! Should we enjoy? Come on, go into the room and enjoy. You’ll know. -Hello! -Oh Manager, why did you come? -Is it? -I’ll send someone else. -Even you are ok to us for this night. -Is it? -Oh no, leave me. -Manager is out, in the room. Oh no! Don’t beat! Oh no! Hey, what are they doing inside? -Even my wife never tried like this? -Yes, that’s the thing. Sir, that geyser guy! You wait, baby! It is burning inside, is he taking bath or swimming inside? -What work do you have at this hour? Go! -You leave! They are hungry inside. Do something and get me out of this trouble. -Get you out of trouble? -This is in your hands, Rishi!

Our guys have rounded up, brother. -Ok, carry on! -Ok, brother! -Hey! -Thank God! -Where is she, man? Hey, come on search! Bloody hell! Brother will cut our head if we don’t take her head. -Then, how brother? -What to do? -Hey, idea! Come, I’ll tell. -Come on, guys. Hey monster! Stop, have you gone mad? I just thought you’d cheat. What are those fights in the midnight? Added is that mask in the midnight again. -Aishwarya! I don’t understand anything. -I’ll tell. What exactly happened is, when we were renovating the temple which is inheritance for our dynasty… Two most valuable diamonds of the world were found there. My dad wished to use them for the village and people there. That rascal getting to know about those diamonds killed my brother and dad very cruelly. I’ve been searching for him from then. But he’s been escaping around. Damn! He’ll definitely die in my hands some time. Control Aishwarya, I can understand. He took away my brother and dad, who were my life. I won’t leave him. I know the pain of losing close ones and being an orphan well, as an orphan. There’s justice in your revenge. God will never do injustice to the justice. Rishi, you drove away my loneliness with your consoling. -Hey, man! -Brother! -Can I believe? -Yes brother! I promise on the dummy heart of this Doctor idiot. -What? Promise on my heart? -Yes! Idiots, how many more dramas will you make me play still? -My neck was almost cut. -Idiot, shut up! Yes brother, we cut her neck and are bringing the head. There were two Police. So, we buried that head there and brought the helmet, brother. Here is the helmet, brother. Say, guys! -Yes, brother! -Yes, brother! -Police? -About turn! -Yeah! -Left, right! -Left, right! -Oh no, idiot! Dude, you think these are real Police? -Not police, but vagabonds! Amazing, wow!

I’ve seen real love only with you in my life. I wish to have the same love now for life long. I love you. I cannot live without you. I’m so sorry, I gave you so much of pain. What are you seeing? Don’t say no to my love. You understood my love at least now, come on. We don’t need this stolen money. I’ll work hard and earn for you. I’ll keep you happy. Come on! How can we be happy without having money? Why not? I’ll keep you happy. I’ll work hard and earn. We don’t need this money. Come, let’s go. -I want you with money. -I knew that you just need money. I too was with your mind set first to marry a rich girl and settle in life. -What guys? -Yes! But knowingly or unknowingly, I fell in your love. After that I came on to roads. I understood what love means. Fine, you didn’t understand my love. So many shot each other and died now for money. Didn’t you still realise? Still, what’s there in that money? It comes by working hard and is gone when spent. Oh yes! You never work hard, right? You live in fear every second and show off like living great. Ask your heart about the value of that life. -If you still need that money, here take it. -Dude, 50 crores! -Are you sure? -Yeah sure! Ok, good bye! -She’ll never change. -Damn, what is this fellow? Dude, take back at least the nine lakhs we spent from that. Hey, leave it dude. -Why did you dash again? -What? Oh, I dashed now right? Where is your love? Nowhere to be seen! She has more love on that fifty crores bag than on me. -Thus, I gave it off. -What? -Are you crazy? -Fine, close your eyes once. -Why? -Listen, close for once. -Ok! Open your eyes! For what you lost your everything, those diamonds should belong to you. Person valuable than these is standing before my eyes. Rishi, shall I say you something? The day you felt my pain, love on you started from that day in me. These aren’t so valuable to me than my love. I can’t see. Carry me. Dude, fortune of a king is in your fate. -Hey, turn! -We’ve to get up from here. -What’s this? Come on, no rounds. -This is a bit correct! -Right, left! -This doesn’t seem to leave us. -You said it correct.
