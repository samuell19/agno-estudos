"Early Spring Story" It's dirty, stop it. Saliva has the taste of childhood. Why don't you try it, Hitomi? It's true. The taste brings back memories. Asako, is this how you remember your childhood? I had no idea that you're so gloomy. Fumiya licks his nose when he's bored. Who's Fumiya? My boyfriend. We've been dating for a month. Third year in senior high, we met at the surf shop. He licks his nose. Interesting. - (Attention students... ) - No. (After you've finished cleaning up... ) - (Please return the equipment to its place) - That's it. - (And those students who are in clubs... ) - Also... (Please don't be late) - No way. - (And class 8 of 3rd year... ) Really? Just kissing. That's all. Bullshit. My heart was beating so fast during the first kiss. Nothing but blankness. I felt nothing except appreciation. But it's different lately. When he kisses my ear and forehead. I wouldn't say that it's annoying. I just feel uneasy. As if I might float into some unknown place. Asako, you're moving further and further from reality. Am not. I am not sure. We have periods when we reach puberty. In that case would kissing be puberty in our mental environment? Having periods is natural. It has nothing to do with our will. But it's our choice to kiss or sleep with someone. You're so rational. Anyway, I'll just let nature take its course. So the photography club's latest project is Spring? Yes. We have to film the Spring of Kamakura. The title is "Spring comes and goes" Asako, I'll go get changed right away. I'll wait for you. So? He's the one who licks Asako's nose. Wait. Don't say anything in front of him. Asako, have you been dreaming? Dream? You mean that dream? Yes, that dream. Yes. Very often lately. Feels like something is on top of me, I can't breathe. I woke up when I was about to scream. And a bit wet too. So annoying. Is it because we're about to turn into an adult. It's not like I don't have a mom. I felt really lonely then, and I cried in the middle of the night. It seems like my body is dirty. I understand. But there's nothing we could do, we're seventeen, we're not kids anymore. Hitomi, you should start dating, then you can know how 'Spring comes and goes' feels. I'm not ready yet. I want to do some research for the photography project. Masako is with teacher Mr. Yokoya. Let me take a look. I heard rumours of them being together, so it's true. Hitomi. I'm going on a business trip tomorrow. Call the office for me, contact them. Where are you going? Nagano. I see. Miss Oya, let me help you with the bags. No, thanks. I can manage. Don't worry. You'll be one of the family soon. Forget it then. Just let her help you. In that case, thanks very much. Let's have sukiyaki today. I bought some A grade beef. Who's cooking? Hitomi, we're counting on you. I don't know how to make the seasoning. Are you mocking me? Miss Oya, why don't you do the cooking? Just add some soy sauce, sweet sauce for the taste. A bit of chili sauce and some sugar will do the trick. That's it. But the soup is more important. No worries. Sukiyaki in my family isn't a big deal. Do the cooking, my dad will be pleased. Who is it? Dinner's ready. I'll be right down. What is it? I'll be away for a week, are you alright to be at home by yourself? What do you mean? Aren't you on school break starting tomorrow? To be honest, I'm quite worried to leave you here on your own. That's why I'm thinking maybe to ask Keiko to move in. What do you think? It's fine. But... I'll get used to it after you're married. Don't worry. I'm not. I'm OK with it, if that's what you want, dad. Really? Then I'll ask her to come over. Come down for dinner. Where's Miss Oya? Should be ready soon. Let's begin. I packed your sweater too. Don't bring too much luggage. You're staying in a ryokan? You won't be doing laundry, that's why I packed a few more clothes. It's going to be heavy. It won't be that bad. Dad. Don't postpone your return date. Why? It's mom's death anniversary on 31st, don't forget. Thanks, we've troubled you. Not at all. This is the country side. You must visit again, if you don't mind. Now that my health has come to this, I couldn't help even I want to. Sorry. Don't worry, I'll make some calls for you. Don't worry about it. Don't tire yourself out. You should rest more. Take care. Sorry about it. Thanks for your visit. Goodbye. Thank you. It seems Mr. Takenaka won't have much time left. Yes, he's lost a lot of weight. I was shocked. I thought he's going to be fine, that's why I worked in his team. If he didn't have cancer, I'm sure he can solve your problem. The people at the office are awful, once they found out he has cancer, they started to look for others to work for. I think Mr. Takenaka feels helpless too. But for us, those who are left behind, what should we do? The enemies have been waiting for this chance. There's nothing we could do about it. Don't be so pessimistic. You're about to become the scapegoat. At least let them know of your aspirations. My aspirations... I should take the train back. It's time to go back. I'll give you a lift to the station. It doesn't feel right. Hey there. You're here too? Can't get a good view? No. There are lots of visitors today. So annoying. Not bad. Shinagawa 5963? Excuse me, is the car owner of Shinagawa 5963 around? Sorry, I don't know. Excuse me. Is the car owner of Shinagawa 5963 around? Is the car owner of Shinagawa 5963 around? Shinagawa 5963's owner. That's mine. Over here. I've been calling for a while, why didn't you answer? Sorry, it's not my car. That's why I didn't notice. Could you move it? Sure. - Will this do? - A bit more. A bit more. A little bit more. That will do. The cherry blossoms are beautiful. Japan's cherry blossoms are the most beautiful. Very pretty. But I'm not taking pictures of them. The theme for my project is Spring. Spring? That's why you're taking pictures of them. I see. Cherry blossoms represent Spring. It seems ordinary. I'm sorry that it is. No, I mean cherry blossoms alone don't represent Spring. Is that so? Give me an example. An example... right. To me, you're like Spring. That's Spring in your eyes, uncle. Not my Spring. Wouldn't it be strange to take pictures of myself? What are you doing? It's written here "Don't break the branches" Stop it. Come down. Little brat! Come down! Take the snapshot! Now. - Doesn't this represent Spring? - Come down. Is that so? Something so simple? I think something's missing. How long do you plan on staying here? I'm about to leave. Bye. Bye. - What's going on? - Can't move at all. This is crazy. It's the peak hours. I'm heading back to Tokyo. Do you know a short cut? Short cut. Can you make a U-turn? U-turn? I'll tell you if you can. Alright, I'll try. What's going on? This is a one way street. So that's what the sign means. Is there another way? No. It's only a little bit further. Just go. I don't see any policeman. How could I? No policeman? This is a one way street. Yes. He said it's a one way street, let's go over there. You're taking pictures because you've joined a club? A club? You're in high school, right? First year of senior high? Please. Do you know how old you gotta be to study in first year of senior high? No. 16. What about a sophomore in university? Sophomore? Don't know. Do the math. Twenty. I'm twenty. Twenty? You don't look twenty. Of course I don't. I just turned twenty yesterday. Really? And I thought you're a high school student. Sorry. Forget it. I'm used to it. Excuse me. Could I have some soba? Right away. I've a baby face. That's why I look younger. So you're a university student. And the university wants you to take pictures? Correct. And you, uncle? Uncle? My surname is Ogawa. Sorry. Around thirty six years old? Forty two. You don't look your age. I've a baby face. Right. Sorry that took so long. What's your name? Hitomi. What do you do, Mr. Ogawa? I work in a small company, in the steel trading industry. Impressive. You look like you're in management. Outstanding. It's steel, but it's more like scrap steel. Scrap steel? Yes... like rubbish of steel. Although it's a trading company, but the office is in an old 3-storyed building. Old building? Yes. That's why we don't have any big deals. We sell cheap steel to New Jersey in U.S. Or some small towns in Texas. We drive around looking for buyers. How should I put it? Like a traveling salesman. I spend most of my time on the highway, traveling hundreds of miles everyday. Often staying at some unknown villages, in one of those poor-hygiene motels! As for the food, I drink port wine in order to help chew down the tough and not-so-tasty steaks. That's life. Day after day, routine. I could almost picture what it's like. Though it might seem a little bit sad, but I like it. Are you pitying me? But I kind of enjoyed those days. Oh! It's late. - Let's go. - Sure. Thanks. You're welcome. Did you enjoy the food? Very nice. Great, it's a famous restaurant. Really? There are some good restaurants near my office, behind the Hibiya City Hall. You could try those sometime. I should be going to Ginza soon, I'll take a look if I have time. Great. Wait, Hitomi. I just called you. Who answered the call? My future step-mom. Your dad has already brought her home? Don't make it sound so serious. My dad's away on business trip, she's here to take care of things. I am not used to it. I get annoyed just thinking I need to live with her. You won't run away from home, will you? I'm not such a coward. I'm going to a photo exhibition in Ginza. I'm headed there too. I'm meeting Fumiya at "Marion". It's a date. Do you often go to Tokyo for a date? It's the first time. He insisted since it's spring break n' all. Where are you going after the photo exhibition? Returning to Kamakura feeling alone? Quite the opposite. I've a date too. I'm just going to the photo exhibition since I'm there. It's our first date. What's with your look? You don't trust me? It's so sudden. Well, boyfriends appear suddenly, don't you agree? Are you serious? What's he like? He works in the steel industry; Flies often to U.S. For work. How old? Forty two. Forty two? Too dangerous. What if it's a trap? We'll see then. Excuse me. Is there a noodles restaurant around? I'm not sure, I'm from the countryside. And you live in Tokyo? Miss. There's one over there. Thanks. It's over there. Excuse me. Welcome. Do you have a customer named Mr. Ogawa? Mr. Ogawa? His office is close by. He's around forty two. Mr. Ogawa of Nikon & Co? Yes, that's the one. Excuse me. Yes. Is there an old three storied building around here? There's a company named Nikon & Co. Have you heard of it? That's our company. But this is the only office tower. Sorry. Mr. Ogawa? Which department? Scrap steel. Oh, Mr. Ogawa. He's stationed abroad, he's in the Iron & Steel dept. Stationed abroad like a traveling salesman? Mr. Shinji Ogawa who works in New York office? Mr. Ogawa, your call. Over there. Meeting a guest? Who's Miss Okino? Photographer? Mr. Ogawa. I am... From Kamakura. You're Hitomi? Yes. What's going on? You look very mature. Almost couldn't recognise you. Oh yeah? This is how I normally dress. Mr. Ogawa, you look different. I can't recognise you. Really? How did you find my office? You mentioned it's a 3-storyed old building, couldn't miss it. It was once. And it was once that you're a traveling salesman of scrap steel. Yes, what is the matter? I'm meeting a friend nearby. But I'm early. When I was walking around, I remembered you. Is it inconvenient for me to be here? It's an hon our. Are you free? For a short while. Let's have lunch. In that case. Do you have a phone here? Over there. Hello, Okino Residence. Okino Residence. Rain check? Bye. Sorry. I'll be free in four, five hours. But there's a cocktail reception in Roppongi this evening. If you're free, let's meet there. You just need to wait for me. It's a small reception, we can go if you like. Sure. Great. Call me at the office at five, we'll figure a time and place to meet then. See you later. Ladies and gentlemen, the train is approaching the terminus, please remember your personal belongings. - Excuse me. - Yes. I want this. - It's 1500 yen. - Alright. What's the matter? All adults here. There are some young people. Ogawa. It's been a while. Come over. You've aged. I couldn't recognise you. You were stationed in New York all those years, but I was in the war zone, middle east! I really envy you. What are you talking about? New York is just the same, only without the war. Do you want to eat anything? I'm not hungry. Have a drink. Thanks. Thanks. Your daughter... how is it possible? You're single, right? This is Miss Hitomi Okino, she will be a photographer in a few years. You should greet her properly. I'm Yamasaki, Asian Petroleum. Nice to meet you. I'm Hitomi Okino. I'm Koizumi. - Hello. - How do you do? Do you know how to dance? A little. Great, let's dance. Please. You're a good dancer. Mr. Ogawa, you lead well. Who taught you? My mom. Your mother. Excuse me, if you don't mind. Since when did you turn into a paedophile? They're all laughing at you over there. So annoying. That's ridiculous. My place tonight? You'll be there? Please. Huh... Yes? Nothing. That woman is really pretty. Bravo... Bravo. She's gonna break a lot of hearts. But we still have to wait till you grow up. Ogawa, you better not break her heart. He's still not married at his age, it means he can't be a good guy. His gold-digging dream in U.S.! Right. - What a joke! - Exactly. Shut up, will you? You don't understand me. I understand you, dear. I'll give you comfort. Lucky you! Do you want to sit beside me and rest? No thanks. I think middle aged women are scary. Mr. Ogawa, is this your social life? It's mom's death anniversary, and he's not here. Has he forgotten about mom? He called to say that his business trip is postponed. He hasn't forgotten. Will you shut up and stop thinking you're so important? This is between me and my dad; family business. Hitomi, do we need to talk? About what? Your dad's second marriage. What's there to talk about? I've agreed to it. And it's a fact. Go talk to my dad if you have any questions. Hitomi, you're evasive. Evasive? What are you trying to say? I think you're the one who has something to say. Look at you, acting like a step mom already. That's right. Remember. I'll always be your step mom. I'll never let you get away with being rude. You don't like it? You've done me a huge favour. I'll be a good wife first, then work on being a mother. Tea? Hitomi? Sure. What is it? You have something to tell me? No big deal. Would mom and daughter have similar tastes? What are you talking about? Does your boyfriend look similar to your dad? No way. Don't be silly. What's going on? Nothing. Welcome. An orange juice for me. Sure. You've been acting strange today. Did something happen between you and that middle aged man? Have you followed him to the unknown world? How's that possible? Nonsense. You're acting like a goody-goody again. It's not a terrible thing. It's going to happen between me and Fumiya soon. Liar. Really? He asked me to go on an overnight trip with him. And? You agreed? I think it's time. I really gave it some thought of course. And after all know I like Fumiya, and he's the best candidate. Really? You can make your own decision on this. Enough about me. Hitomi, you must be more careful. He's a middle-aged man. You might turn into Masako. You mean her and the teacher? After the school found out about them, it was such a mess. The teacher had to switch to another school. The school has talked to Masako's parents, I think she will drop out from school. - A beer please. - Right away. Could she be calling the teacher? But the teacher has kids. Do you think he will divorce his wife? Silly. How would a middle-aged man give up everything for her? No matter what, you must come and see me. I'll wait until you show up. Bye. Here you go. I heard you're dating the teacher. Ignore the old man. Let's have some fun tonight. Why are you acting like this? Come on. Bitch. I don't have time to play with you. I'm serious. Let go. This picture was taken at the trip to Hakone. I miss those days. Do you know this guy? Mr. Ogawa, he was a college student then. So they met then. And then? Was he dating my mom? Yes. He's a heartless guy. At work when he got an opportunity to relocate abroad, he had to choose between your mom and his job. And he dumped your mom. Poor woman. She was crying everyday, because she really loved him. Give it some time, I'm sure the American company will think of a plan. Three more years... no, one year will do. And I'll head to the States then. To the company, I'm like a dead person. But I don't want to dwell too much on it. So lonely. When are you going back? I guess next week. Then we won't see each other again. I think this might be the time when all of us come to our senses. I thought that I might bump into you here. How come you're in Kamakura? My supervisor is sick, I'm here to visit him. Oh I see. You aren't your usual perky self today, did you have a fight with your boyfriend? I'm thinking whether I should see him again. Why don't you ask me why? Because we all have our own reasons. Is this your approach? Mr. Ogawa? Because you don't want others to probe into your past? Sometimes I don't want to answer, then I'll get really drunk, and keep repeating one thing. Until everyone got tired of me. If that's the case, I should go drinking. Do you want to eat? I want to go for a ride. Good idea, where to? Hakone. Have you ever been married, Mr. Ogawa? Unfortunately, never. You have dumped a woman in order to be outstanding in your career? I'm not outstanding. Because our first steel company in U.S. Failed, that's why they transferred me back to Japan. They want me to take responsibility for it. What a lovely place. If only I had my camera. You want me to take a picture of you? I don't have a camera either. We can just pretend. Just a second. I'm set. Come on, "ka-cha". Something on your mind? Did you remember something? No. I'll take your picture now. Ka-cha. Let's take a picture together. No, thanks. I insist. I've set it to "auto picture". Ten seconds, nine, eight... Hurry. Time over. Right. Why take pictures that can't be developed! How did you know about this place? Been here before? My mom took me here when I was little. And you, Mr. Ogawa? I've been here before too. With whom? With whom? I forget. It's decades ago. Right. Mr. Ogawa, you just said you forgot. You've also forgotten that not so important memories? What are you talking about? The fact that you've been here before. What's the matter? Why all the questions? You must have taken some pictures then. Possibly. Do you have that picture? I don't know. I've moved residence so often, could have easily misplaced it. But I think someone must have cherished that picture. Is that so? Yes. Mr. Ogawa, you threw it right? You threw the picture along with the memories away. It seems you're lecturing me. Are you sure you can hold the drinks? No problem, refill. With my personality, I think it's better when I'm drunk. I like to pretend to be a Miss goody two-shoes. So silly of me, right? Not at all. No. That's what you say, but your eyes say otherwise. I really mind what the others think of me. I chicken out then & there! I can't say what I really want to say. I thought you always speak your mind. Really? You think? I feel like I haven't said anything. Very well. Then you can say whatever you want. Are you with the woman who came here in the past? You're bringing up the past again. I only have the courage to say it after I've had a drink. Yes. She would never get drunk. Young girls those days were careful about what they said, or they might get in trouble. Then it's really awful of me to be drunk. Not exactly. Anyway, we weren't in love. We just squabbled. That's youth. No, that's not it. Not squabbling doesn't mean that's love either. Because love can make someone talk more. You don't get it. Mr. Ogawa, you don't get it at all. Sorry to keep you waiting. Are you alright? I'm fine now. Let's go back. Mr. Ogawa, why would you accompany me today? I have no idea. Maybe because I'm feeling down, and you can cheer me up. Cheer up? Can I cheer you up? Then why would you accompany me? I have no idea. I don't know. Are you alright? I'm not sure what's wrong with me. I don't know. You haven't kissed before? Oh a few times. A few times. Sorry. A few times. Really? A few times. A few times. Where are we? Senga Dad. Hitomi. You're back. Here's a present for you. Why are you back so late? I went to search for mom's footsteps. Pardon? Why didn't you come back on her death anniversary? Sorry. Why didn't you come back? It's only been four years. Have you forgotten about her? Dad. It's her death anniversary. Don't you think that it's too strange for a step-mom and daughter to go alone? It's so unnatural, I couldn't take it. She might be your wife, but she's nothing to me. Do you understand how a daughter feels? You don't, right? Take this present. You act like as if you brought this only for me. In fact, Miss Oya's present is in your bag. I really hate how you do this. I really hate it. I can't take this anymore. Welcome. Welcome. Where have you been? I called your hotel several times. I went to Hakone. Hakone, what for? To find lost memories. It's been twenty years. You're old? Maybe. But I really feel old today. Where are you going? I've something to do. If you have time this week, let's visit her grave. Did you and mom fall in love before marriage? No, it was an arranged match. A match? Even so. But to me, it was just like love. It was love at first sight. And mom? Do you think anyone would? I was really captured by your mom. I tried very hard to pursue her, at the time when I was about to give up, because I heard nothing from her. At the construction site she once came to look for me. I mean, being a work site, there were many rude guys. They were mocking me. So I grabbed her hand, and kept running apologising all the while. I remember it well. Then your mom suddenly said, Please take good care of me I was shocked. I turned my head towards her, she was crying. And I kept nodding. I was thrilled. I remember so well. Some company in U.S. Suggested a merger with our branch there, to let TOB as the core. Of course our company would invest into TOB. We bought 4% of stocks. The topics we're going to discuss today, The Canadian branch has developed 12%. Enough, Ogawa. We're not here to listen to your excuse. Clearly your direction was wrong. We'd like to hear more about that. I admit that some of our direction was wrong. But after you've read the information, you can understand. What can we tell from such simple stats? We'll give out a more detailed one. Hold on. Excuse me. Hello. Have you seen the picture? What picture? The one I put in your briefcase. Hold on. Ogawa, yours. Give me a second. Can you see it now? Where are you now? I'm in a cafe "Oil Lamp" in Kanda. You know that one? Yes. I'd like to see you. I'll be there at four, is that alright? Sure, I'll be waiting for you here. Welcome. Excuse me. Was there a nursing school dormitory nearby twenty years ago? You know the place? That old building is still here. Above the slope with Athena. My mom worked in here part time then. Really? But my dad ran the cafe then, I'm not sure. There were many students working here. Welcome. Welcome. Sorry, I don't have much time. I need to go back in thirty minutes. We're in a meeting. What's this about? The one on left is my mom. Shimasaki Sakae Do you remember her? How is she? She is dead. She passed away four years ago due to sickness. Passed away? I see. The woman you dumped is dead, do you feel anything? You left her for your outstanding career. I heard. From whom? It doesn't matter who told me. Why are you asking me this? You approached me because you wanted to find out about this? Don't make me sound so awful. I just want to know the truth. My mom was your former girlfriend, right? Yes. You dumped her for your career? Eventually it turned out like that. What's your answer? You're a terrible person. My poor dad. He married someone who doesn't love him. It's too tragic. What you said isn't fair to your parents. Your mom chose to marry your dad, it had nothing to do with me. That's because she gave up. You can't say that it's a terrible marriage. If you keep thinking like this, it won't do you any good. You'll be too scared to love. Because you're still young. That's why you feel for others' wounds. After we get hurt, we can heal ourselves. We can forget the pain. A man who dumped a woman for his career... Stop lecturing. Hitomi. Yes. Could you hang out with me? Sure. I was serious. But after it's over, it turned into a scandal. So sad! I caused trouble to the teacher, his wife & many others. But I really love him, no matter what others say. I'll never regret it. Because I don't think I did anything wrong. I like the teacher. We love each other. I could say that we're really blessed, that's why I give up. It doesn't matter whether we break up or not. Let's dance. I'm not going home tonight. After I met you, I realised what a dull life I led. It's pathetic. There's no need to get hurt on purpose. I want to get hurt. It's painful. It doesn't matter even if it's painful. You're hurt! But you're great. Mr. Ogawa, you want to sing "Silver Love"? Come on stage. Leave me alone. Sing it yourself. Give us a song. You're going back to U.S. Next week. Drink your boredom away, have a good time before you leave. Drink my boredom away? Drink your boredom away. That's funny. I have to leave because of whom? Stop it, Ogawa. What did I do? Sir, what's wrong with him? Enough, jackass. Jackass. Nicely put. You're right, a jackass indeed. I follow orders. A project fails and I take the blame for it. I'm the jackass who has to leave town. Right? Chief? What? Are you delusional? You're heading back to U.S. To pick up the pieces, then being thrown to the edge of the world. A scrap steel traveling salesman at the edge of the world. Not bad. Why don't you come with me, too, Sir? Sure. Selling scrap steel or whatever. Let's sing before that. Sing... come on. We've waited long enough! - Go on. - Come on. I'll join you too. You've had a lot to drink. Come here. Sit tight. You've had too much to drink. I'm not drunk. I had to say it. In the end I'm like a dog. Who is she? Will you go home? I'm here already, you must be kidding. You're going back to U.S. Next week. - Please. - I don't want to leave. Go. Go on. Sorry. Come in. Have you been waiting for me? You're going back to U.S. Soon? Yes. Why didn't you tell me? Why should I tell you? You're right. There's no need to inform the person who cheers you up, no need to tell a girl whom you've only kissed. Where are you going? Freshen up and then I'll give you a lift home. Don't try to run. You left my mom easily. But I wouldn't let you go that easily. What do you think you're doing? You should know. I want you to do what you did to my mom. Brat, what are you thinking? I look very much like my mom. If you hold me, you can remember her. Idiot. You slept with my mom, didn't you? She wasn't that kind of a woman. Don't say that. Don't insult your own mother. Put it on. Put it on. Don't pretend you're a nice guy. After this, then you can go back to U.S. Hold me. Come on. Unbelievable. What's wrong with you? Put your clothes back on before I come out. You're too old to run. Who are you kidding? Come out. You're a bad guy. You think you can dump women so easily? Then do worse. Dump me like you dumped my mom. Come out. In that case, I will. Strip. Strip and wait. What's wrong? What are you doing? Scared? Come on. Come on. Where's your courage? I'll hold you. Come on... I'll hold you. Don't run. Put them back on. Go in. Go in. I won't resist this time. Go in from there. Go in. - Go on. - Stop it. - Go. - Stupid! What are you doing? - Go in. - Watch out! Don't worry, she's fine. Please wait a minute. Thanks. Sorry. I heard that you're going back to the States, I got angry. Say no more. Tell me about my mom. It was my senior year in university, I went to Hakone with some friends. While we were walking around, a young girl approached us, waving her arms. She said, "Excuse me, could you take a picture for us?" Then she handed me the camera. That's your mom. Camera. We've such a striking resemblance! Is the car owner of Shinagawa 5963 around? And then, I fell in love with her. I found out that she was in a nursing school, and she worked at "Oil Lamp" in Kanda. I'd go look for her whenever I didn't have a class. After your mom finished work, I'd walk her back to the dorm. From the cafe, it's going downhill besides "Nicholas". The three of us often wandered down that slope. Three of you? She's your mom's best friend, do you know? No. Aren't girls like that? Study together, work together, share a room in the dorm. Fell in love with the same guy? Because I was young, I couldn't tell them what I thought. When I decided I'd work abroad, I finally told your mom how I felt. After her friend found out about that, she must be heartbroken, and jumped off the roof. In front of your mom too. Luckily she lived, but, it's all over between the three of us. Don't move. In fact, I'm not too sure. But if I don't say it now, there won't be another chance. What is it? I think this is love. It's fine even if you don't love me. I'm not my mother. Please kiss me. Kiss me. I'm very sorry. Please hit me until you've vent out your anger. Do I look like that kind of a person? I'm different from the way I look. I really hate violence. I'm not the sensitive kind. I'm not sure therefore what goes on in my daughter's head. Does Hitomi like you a lot? No, she came looking for trouble. This. Troublesome. You're the person who's always on my late wife's mind. Can't believe that it's Hitomi's turn. What do you want to say to Hitomi if you see her? What are your plans? I plan to do some traveling sales in South America, second chance. In that case, I'll tell her. - You don't need to see her. - And... I like her, a lot. Mr. Ogawa, please. Will you control yourself? If I don't wake Hitomi up from her dream, I guess she could never stand back up again. I think I should make this clear. Hitomi thinks of me as some kind of a glorified person. She wants to give more to an object of her affection. That's why. If I tell her that I really like her, really like her; Then she'd think I'm just like the rest. She wouldn't find me attractive anymore, and eventually will forget about me. I'm leaving the day after tomorrow. Please let me see her once more. Please. Hitomi's attending a friend's funeral. Please don't tell her that you like her. Your dad told me. Was she a good friend? She and our teacher committed suicide together. She said she'd give up. But I guess she is very happy now. That's why I won't cry today. You're very strong. I'm not, I'm weak in fact. Because I'm a coward. A coward won't commit suicide. You got fired? Sorry. No. I quit. I'm going to South America. My friend's company has made an offer. That company is in an old three-storied building. I'll be a traveling salesman of scrap steel. In ten years, I'll turn it into an office tower. You're leaving? Terrible. Just like saying goodbye to my mom. It's terrible. Mr. Ogawa, you're enjoying this. At my age it's embarrassing enough to start over again from afar. You asked for it. Thank you for coming. We really appreciate it. I wouldn't hope that you would understand such a disgraceful way of dying. As her parents, we do hope that she can rest in peace. Thank you. It's getting warm. That's interesting. I was about to say the same thing. After I met Mr. Ogawa, I've lost all my sense. Is it warm or cold? I can't tell. But today I can feel that it's warm. Will you see me off? Probably not. Spring break is almost over, I need to prepare for the new school term. Attention, ladies and gentlemen, passengers of the flight to San Francisco will be boarding at Gate 17. Please be prepared for boarding. Bye. You really are a jackass. I am. Give it another five, six years, and everything could be different. If I were you, I'd put up with it. I guess during that period of endurance, my heart's aging process would speed up. What are you afraid of? You're middle-aged. I've worked for twenty years; In the end, you're the only one here. Thanks. Take care. You too. Did my mom see you off twenty years ago? No, she didn't. No? That's great. In that case, I'm also on behalf of her today. I like you. I really like you. My dad told me. I'm fine, you don't have to say that. It's true. No. I really like you. I really like you, the 17 year old. Thanks, Mr. Ogawa. Bye. Bye, Hitomi. Hitomi. What is it? I finally had the experience. I'm a woman now. With experience alone, you can't become a woman. What are you bragging about? I created the past. What do you mean? Painful love. I turned into a woman of the past.
