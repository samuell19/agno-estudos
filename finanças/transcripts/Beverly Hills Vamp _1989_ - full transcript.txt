[ dramatic organ music playing ] Vampires, fact or lurid dime-novel fiction? Reality or the stuff of twisted imaginations, created by filmmakers seeking excuses to photograph women with breasts larger than their head? Hello, I'm Professor Sommerset, and this is Vampire Central. Within these walls, the study of undead phenomenon isn't taken lightly. In fact, we're dead serious about it. Every day, hundreds of calls come in reporting sightings and attacks-- Desperate people with desperate problems, all looking to Vampire Central to help against this growing horror. [ phone rings ] Oh, there's a call now. Vampire Central. Yes? No. No, listen, it's very easy-- Pepperoni on its own side. Yes, sausage and onion on its own side. Thank you. After years of painstaking research in the field of history, geography, genealogy, and mammography, the shocking truth has become clearly evident-- Not only do vampires really exist, but currently they represent a shadowy worldwide scourge that makes the bubonic plague look like the hiccups. Here at the center, we're well equipped to track this problem and pinpoint the troublesome areas. Let's take a look. What's it like out there today, Sandra? - [ typewriters clacking ] - Well, professor, there's a heavy concentration of vampires moving in from northern California, which should bring some pretty heavy scares to those people just east of Las Vegas, Nevada, by early tomorrow morning. That doesn't sound too good. No, it doesn't. And while that front moves across the state, we're expecting unusually high appetites and a lot of cloudiness. It's gonna be dark out there. Everyone should drive carefully. And remember, don't pick up any hitchhikers. It's gonna be raining blood for the next few days. You heard me-- Cancel my gig at the Sahara. Gotta go now. Thanks for that report, Sandra. Anytime, professor. You're probably asking yourself, how in the hell could something like this happen? Well, don't ask me. I'm just a man like any one of you. However, I think I can trace the problem right into your own living room. That's right, buddy, you're the problem. And don't sit there looking so smug either, you little wimp. It's you, all right. You're the troublemaker because you don't believe in them. That's right. The vampires' greatest strength is that people refuse to acknowledge their existence. The case you're about to see, taken word for word from "The Big Book Of Vampires," is just such a story. In it you will see sex, blood, girls with huge melons, more blood, stupid, naive kids, and a lot more blood. And in case you're wondering just what to look for when you're out vampire hunting, this is a good place to start. "The Big Book Of Vampires," it's at your local library. Check it out. [ thunder rumbles ] - [ thunder rumbling ] - [ crickets chirping ] [ distant howling ] [ sighs ] That was incredible. We aim to please, officer. You know, you should be arrested for assaulting a police officer with a deadly weapon. Well, are you willing to let me off on a warning? Maybe, but I'll have to confiscate your weapons. Again? 'Fraid so. Well, all right, but this time we're gonna do things my way. You know, you girls should be a little more subtle in your advertising. This is Beverly Hills, you know. We should be hauling you down to the station right now. I don't know how I'm going to explain this one to the chief back at the base. Well, you'll have plenty of time to figure that out. What-- What do you mean? - [ hisses ] - [ organ playing ] [ girl neighs ] - Giddy up, horsey! Giddy up. - Whoa, whoa. Let's ride. - Whoa, whoa! - Oh, oh. - Here comes a hedge! - Oh, baby! Whoa. - And another one. - Oh! Oh, come on, horsey, don't run out of steam now. We're almost to the finish line. When am I gonna get a chance to be the rider? - Huh? - Oh, right after I brand you. Brand me? Where are you gonna brand me? How about... right on your neck? Oh, no! Aah! [ upbeat music playing ] Man: Ah, Hollywood, home of the stars, where people gather from all corners of the globe to stare in awe at the glitter of the famous movie idols we've come to love. Aw, there it is-- Grauman's Chinese Theatre. And Elvis, he never did really die, you know. It was all a hoax. Look, Tom Cruise. Reminds me of myself in my younger days. Ah, Hollywood boul-- Oh, a "physical" reader there. That's swell. Oh, look, there's a movie star! Hey, Eddie! Eddie! I guess he didn't hear me. Tourist traps, yeah. Club Hollywood. Gee, this is swell. Hollywood "Shoppay." Oh, look, Roy Rogers. Wow, look at the bazooms on that babe. Ah, Hollywood, what a town-- Where legends are born. Ah, Frederick's of Hollywood, home of the crotchless panties, edible underwear. Oh, Musso's Franks-- Oh, the Frolic Room. Le Sex Shoppe. Pussycat-- Oh, a veterinarian's place. Gee, I wonder where Spectacular Action Pictures is? Oh, here it is. Oh, there's the address. It's right up here. Come on, fellas. Man: How many copies of this script did you bring? Three. I told you-- Three. Three? Three? Why three? Well, it seemed like a doable number at the time-- One for him to read and a couple for his associates. Maybe we should have just brought a treatment. Treatments don't mean -- in this town. You need a script. Can't tell anything from a treatment. Russ, you bring the tapes? Yeah, right here-- three-quarter, V.H.S., Beta. I mean, with all this stuff, he's bound to look at something. - Great. - Gee, I wish we had more than just the local T.V. ads. - Yeah. - Hey, guys, we have what we have. I know it sounds a little deep for you fellas, but that's what we're selling here-- His script and the three of us-- Package deal. You know, this project's going to be great. I can see every cut, every shot. Yeah. I can't wait to shoot in 35. I mean, the cameras, lenses, so much better than the Super 8. So you guys makin' a movie, huh? That's right. That's nice. Nice? No, see, your nails are nice. Movie's gonna be great. Okay, don't get your underwear tied in a knot. Say, are you an actress? No, I'm the ambassador to Sweden. What do you think I am? Hey, hey, hey, don't tie your underwears up all in knots and stuff. Hmph, don't wear any. This is Hollywood. Um, excuse me. Ahem. What's your name? Sherry Santa Monica. Oh, any relation to the street? [ laughs ] It's not my real name. It's my nom de plumage. All: Ahh! Something funny? Uh, no, no, nothing. Say, maybe you'd like to be in our movie? I mean, yes, you have very well-developed cheekbones. Ha! So what's this epic about anyway? Oh, I'll tell you all about it. It's sort of a tender love story. It's about the loss of innocence, a guy learning to take control of his life, and learning values in the wake of personal loss. You know, that kind of thing. Any nudity? - Nudity? - Yeah, nudity. They don't exactly hire me to do Ensign Chekhov, you know? Well, there's-- Tell her. Tell her. Eh, that's okay. I only do topless now anyway. My hardcore days are behind me. [ laughs ] Get it? Behind me? [ all laugh ] You guys are really clever, you know? [ intercom buzzes ] Yes, sir? Okay. You can go in now. Mr. Pendleton is ready to see you. Oh, thank you. - Thanks a lot. - Thank you. Was it good for you, too, big boy? Can I get you a Band-Aid? What do you mean I can't get a product placement deal with Lamborghini? Hey, you know who you're talking to? Aaron Pendleton, spectacular films. Listen, if you guys don't like it, I may just change the title to "Motorcycles." How do you like that? Come on in. - Come on in. - Put her there, pal. - Hey, Brock! - Good to see you. - Brock, I'd know you anywhere. - I'm Brock. - I'm Brock. - Brock, I'd recognize you anywhere, buddy. Yeah, it's been a long time. How are you, uncle Aaron? Yeah, I haven't seen you since you were about as small as a grip's paycheck, huh? - Paycheck? - Little film humor. Oh, right. Humor. I got it. We got it. Hey, so these two are the other Warner Brothers? Right, this is Russell Penny, cameraman. - Russ, nice to meet you. - Hi. And this is Kyle Carpenter. He wrote the script. - Nice to make your acquaintance. - Carl, hey! - That's Kyle. - Yeah, sure. Hey, a photographer, a scriptwriter-- Just what we need in Hollywood. [ laughs ] Well, sit down. Sit down. Sit down. - How about you, Brocko? - Well, I'm a director. A director! I love this kid. Now... your old man tells me that you're putting a project together, right? - Right. - You want to tell me about it? One better than that-- We got a script. Script? Nobody reads scripts in this town. - You got a treatment? - Uh, treatment? Um, let me have Kyle tell you about it. Sure. Sure, let the writer take a shot at it. Go ahead, shoot, Carl. - It's Kyle. - Yeah, sure. Go ahead. Well, sir, it's a kind of a love story. Yeah, wait a minute-- Kind of a love story, kind of a-- Kind of an offbeat thing, you know? Kind of a weird tale, a twist? - Well, sort of. - Jeez, I like it already. So you got a love story. What's the title? It's called, "What Now, My Love?" "What Now, My Love?" Great title. I remember it already. Now let's get this straight-- You got this love story, and it's called, "What Now, My Love?" and you want to direct it, you want to write it, - And you want to shoot it, right? - That's correct. - Just like that? - Just like that. We got a reel. Well, great, great, great. You mean that shows all the features that you've directed and you've written and you've photographed? Well, not exactly. I mean, it's mostly local T.V. spots we've done. Wonderful. Boys, boys, boys. As much as I love to encourage new talent, you understand, and to bring you along with fresh ideas, I mean, face it-- You don't just waltz into a town like Hollywood and just make a movie. Come on. See, we thought you could help with the production. You know? Studio equipment and everything. No. I'll tell you what I can do for you-- I can probably get you started out doing some crewing work on a couple of films, maybe, you know, just to get your feet wet, help you learn a few things about the ropes. And meanwhile I want you to keep working up on these great ideas, okay? And keep in the back of your head all the time, "Who's going to be seeing my picture?" now... Here's a little something I'm developing right now, sort of a desert epic, you know? Like "Lawrence of Arabia." It's called "Motorcycle Sluts In Heat." [ exhales ] Now there's a love story. Gonna take about five days to shoot it. Fred Olen Ray is dying to direct. Sir, will you at least have a look at our script? Well, sure. Sure. Go ahead and leave it. And give us your reel, too. And meanwhile, what I want you guys to do is to go out and just kind of have some fun, you know? See the sights. Go to Disneyland. Try the Universal Studios tour. You'll learn a lot. I know I did. And I'll tell you what I'll do-- I'll have my girl call your girl in a couple days. We'll do lunch, kid, all right? Right. Ciao. [ dialing ] Yeah, get me Fred Olen Ray on the phone, will you? Yeah, I think it went okay. Some connection, Brock. Yeah? Well, I don't see the M.G.M. lion jumping all over your --. You think he'll at least read our script? - I don't know. - Well, he seemed pretty sincere. Yeah, pretty sincere. He kept calling you Carl. - What's wrong with that? - Your name's Kyle. Oh, yeah. Yeah, but he said it so sincerely. "Motorcycle Sluts In Heat." You know, I could get into some motorcycle footage-- Kind of an "Easy Rider" genre. You ever see Clint Eastwood in "The Great Escape"? Don't show your ignorance. That was Sylvester Stallone. Guys, Harvey Korman. Come on. Let's get the stairs. [ dings ] [ organ playing ] [ knocking at door ] Yes? Man: It is I, Balthazar. Enter. Ahem. Oh, Balthazar, what is it now? You know I need my beauty sleep. You instructed me to inform you when the gentlemen from the police department left the premises. Oh, yes. Did they get off okay? I believe their visit was very satisfactory to all concerned. Mmm. Good. Then maybe they'll stay off our backs for a while. [ laughs ] Get it? "Stay off our backs for a while." Good one, huh? Yes, madam, very humorous. [ sighs ] Balthazar, why don't you lighten up a bit? Yes, ma'am. [ phone rings ] Kyle? Oh, I've been dying for you to call. I miss you already. Yeah, I miss you too, babe. How you doin'? I'm fine. So how was the trip? When did you get in? It was okay. It was a little long after a while, but all in all, it was okay. Yeah, we got in this morning; we went right to our first meeting. You've already had a meeting? That's what we do down here-- We have meetings. Yeah, it was with Brock's uncle. He's a producer. Oh, you told me about him. Well, how'd it go? Well, pretty good. He's gonna get back to us. He's got to read the script and everything. Yeah, these things take time, you know. Yeah, he loved the concept, though. - Really? - And guess what. - He especially loved the title. - My title? He loved my title? Oh, I can't believe it. Yeah, of course. But you know, as they say, nothing's final till the check's in the mail. Yeah. So let's not get too worked up about it. Oh, I won't, but it's-- It's so exciting. Yeah, well, hey, it's Hollywood, babe. Take a walk on the wild side. Yeah, well, let's not get too wild down there. I've heard about those starlets. Starlets? Starlets? No, honest, I haven't seen a single starlet, not in the whole hour. Kyle, you stop it now. I mean it. You stay away from those-- Those bimbos. Okay, I promise. After tonight, no more bimbos. Tonight? What do you mean, tonight? What's happening tonight? Look, did I say tonight? No, no, honest, trust me. I could just kill you. Hey, look, honey, the guys are here. I gotta go. Dinner's served. Hey, Kyle, off the phone. Girls are here! Hey, girls, right in here. Over here, girls. Do you mind? I'm talking to somebody on the phone here. Oh, God, look at 'em. Have you ever seen girls like that before? You never get those at home. Look at the tan lines. Come on, hurry up. You're next. Let's get it going. - Kyle, do you have girls in there? - Yeah. No, Molly, it's only Brock. You know how Brock is. Yeah, I'll see you later, honey. I love you, too. Bye. Oh. Adolescent neanderthal. I was talking to somebody there on the phone. Hey, easy, easy. She knew we were just kidding. Yeah, well... What, are you two getting serious now? Well, you know how it is. Listen, do you know how long it took for me to get up enough courage to ask her out for the first time? No, go ahead and bore us with that one again. Tell us how long it took you to get it up. Wise guy. Guys, I got something to take your mind off everything. - What? - Look at this. - Holy cow. - What is this? What'd you get? - Hey, hey, hey! - Let me see this. - I got 75¢ tied up in this. - Give me my share. Okay, I'll take one section. Brock: I cannot believe some of those ads. Oh, man. Brock: Jesus, this is like a damn sex menu. Is this Hollywood or what? My gosh. Uh-oh, look at this. "I'm for real. Submissive blonde seeks dominant man and couples. Spank me, tease me, please me. I love it all. Plenty of B&D and T.V.s welcome." Hey, Brock, what's T.V.s? Transvestite, idiot. You know, a guy who's not a girl, but he wants to be a girl? Actually, he wears dresses, but he acts sort of like-- It's a chick with balls, Kyle. Gee, I never had one of them. Oh, wait, here's one. "I'll make you wet and make you sweat to see how freakish you can get." Oh! That's it. That's it. - We gotta call one. - Get out of here. No, seriously, I bought this just for the fun of it, but how about it? Let's call one. Wait-- 5'7", 36-26-36, 21 years, 125 lbs, blonde, blue-eyed, seductress, sweet as a peach..." Oh, oh-- "I'll make you feel like a man because I'm 100% woman. Angelyne." - That's it. - I think I'm in love with Angelyne. You see? Do you see that face? How can we abandon a friend in need here, huh? Let's get organized. Okay, we need a group thing going here. Look up a group thing. You know what I mean? Oh, oh, like three of us and three of them? Or three of us and six of them. Or-- Or three of us and a big one of them. Or three of us, two dogs and a pony. Brock, you can count me out of this. I already got a girlfriend. Who, Molly? - Of course! - You guys are separated. - What do you mean, separated? - Well, you're separated. You're here and she's there. That don't matter. I love her. Oh, no. Here we go. Listen, I really believe that if you care about somebody, you should stay faithful to them. Hey, hey, hey, this is Hollywood. Fantasyland. I've met Molly. Very nice girl. However, I'm sure she wouldn't mind. All right, maybe I can just come along as an observer. All right. That's the spirit. Let's go. Hey, hey, hey. Listen. These girls aren't gonna do this for free. We gotta pay 'em with something, don't we? Say no more. Charge card. Plastic for leather. It seems like a fair trade in my books, huh? A charge card? How'd you get hold of a charge card? Well, I save it for emergencies. I can't think of a better one than three naked women. Besides, it's my dad's. Guy's not going to get the bill till next month. - I think I found it. - What? - I think I found it. - You found what? - What do you got? - Well, okay, check this out. "Three little kittens have shaved their mittens. Any guys out there ready to keep us warm? Lovely, sensuous hot ladies. Two's company; three's delicious. We don't bite unless you want us to." Exactly. Let's do it. Let's call. Let's call. - What's the number? - Okay. Oh, get this-- "555-Wett." Okay, look up another one in case this one's busy. - Look up another one. - All right. No animal stuff. It's ringing. It's ringing. It's ringing. Hold on. Shh! Hello? Hi. Did I dial right? 555-Wett. Yeah, we're looking for a lady in the ad. Oh oh, it's the butler. It's the butler. Yeah, we're looking for a little company. Three of us. Right. Yeah. Uh-Huh. Of course. We're young, healthy, and very good-Looking. Uh, we're young and healthy. Right. 8:00? Aw, come on. Can't you make it a little sooner? I don't know if we'll still be young at 8:00. 8:00. Pencil. Pencil. Let me get the directions down here. Okay. Up the hill-- All right-- And left. Okay, we'll see you at 8:00. Oh, and before you go, what city is this in? Oh, my God. I mean, see you at 8:00. - Right. Guys? - What? These girls live in Beverly Hills. - Holy cow, Beverly Hills. - Jesus H. Christ. - Good-- That's good. - Beverly Hills! Yeah! [ organ playing ] You know, I don't think this is such a hot idea. - Oh, yeah? - I'm telling you, money or no money, these beautiful California babes will have nothing to do with guys like us. Yeah, well, you got Molly, and we got nothing, so we're going, and you're coming with us. And besides, when was the last time old Moll put out for you, huh? - Well, uh, uh, uh... - You know what we gotta do? We gotta get the girls. There's no girls in California, so let's go pay for them. Yeah, that's our only solution here. I mean, you know, even if we found those beautiful beach babes, what are we gonna do? They're not even gonna look at us. Hey, come on, act cool, guys. We're in Hollywood now. I'll be back. Wow. Nice tits. Are you gonna buy something? Yeah, sure, lots of things. Well, then get on with it. Yes, ma'am. [ cash register dings ] Ah, yeah, some marshmallows would be good. Let's see. Cigars. Cigars. Huh. What kind would Brock want? I guess these things'll do in a pinch. Beer. Beer. Mmm, I could go for some of this right now. Uhh. Must be Australian or something. [ muttering ] You gonna be here all night? No, ma'am. I'm just about done. I hope this doesn't become a habit with you. No, ma'am. Well, there's only one other thing I need. - What is it? - I, uh... - Spit it out. - I-- I need some, um, protection. They don't sell dogs here. They don't sell guns here. You're in the wrong store. I don't think you understand. I need prophylactics, okay? You know, rubbers? Rubbers? You want rubbers? [ spring boings ] Yeah, lady. What kind do you want, big guy? I don't know. Plain wrap? You cheap-- Wait, lady, look, I just want to buy these, and I just want to get the hell out of here, okay? My friends are waiting for me in the car. I can't sell it to you, casanova. Why's that? Because I don't work here. What? Do you expect me to help you? [ thunder crashing ] [ wolf howls ] [ owl hoots ] [ knocking ] Boy, this isn't what I expected. You sure you got the right directions? Yeah, I got the directions right. You know what it is? It's kind of like "Leave It To Beaver" meets "The Exorcist," huh? I got a weird feeling about this. Yeah, well, most the time, I get a weird feeling about you. "Even a man who is pure in his heart and says his prayers by night..." - Will you knock that off? - Hey, hey. This place gives me the creeps. Yeah, creeps. Me, too. [ thunder rumbles ] Yes? Well, come, come now. Goodness knows I haven't got all evening. We're the guys that called earlier this afternoon. We got an appointment for 8:00. Oh. I suppose so. Follow me. Is this place Hollywood or what? Come on. [ all chattering ] You boys wait here. I'll be back in two shakes. [ thunder rumbles ] Hey, Brock, maybe this isn't such a good idea. Right. Better idea is us three go back to the motel and take turns in the bathroom, huh? - Bathroom? - Come on, this is Hollywood. We're Hollywood. What is it without a little decadence, huh? Biz without show; lane without fast; tinsel without town. - Los without Angeles? - [ clock strikes ] You're a wild man. Come on. [ growls ] - [ clicks ] - Yeah, it's a real nice mansion. The wallpaper's real pretty, and the butler seems like a real friendly guy. Yeah, you can see the whole place is designed to heighten your excitement and expectations. - Hi, Molly. - Do you mind, butt-head? I might use this in a script someday. Butt-head? That's real hip, Kyle. I don't know about this, Brock. I-- [ high-pitched chattering ] God, you're gorgeous. Punch me. I must be dreaming. It's "pinch me." Ouch. Woman: Hello, boys. How is it hanging? It's hanging good. I like you. Like? Like-- I like "like." This is Jessica. This is Claudia, and I'm Kristina. But we don't know your names. This is Russell, and this is Brock. I'm Brock. - What's your name? - My name is a-a-a-a... Kyle. My name is Kyle. Kyle? You look delicious, Kyle. Girls, what do you say we hit the sheets? Now, now. Business before pleasure. Business? Is this on separate checks or all together? Oh, it's on my dad. I mean, it's on-- On me. Oh, how generous. I like your style. I have something very special in mind for you. I bet you do. You haven't seen the half of it yet. I have all sorts of hidden talents. Come on, boys. Right this way. [ spring boings ] You know, I had fantasies, but never like this. Do you like S&M? I like all the letters. Ah! [ both grunting ] So how do you want me to pose? Uh, improvise. Wait, how many shots do I get? As many as you need to get what you want. That's great. Here, wait. Okay. Oh, yeah. Ooh, that's hot. That's good. Okay. Oh, God, yeah. Nice arches. Nice arches. Oh, that's nice. Okay. Ooh. That works for me. That works for me. So you been working here long? A very long time. Yeah, well, it must be very satisfying for you-- Working with the public and all. We don't often do it in public. Yeah, well, what I mean is it must be very satisfying for you to help people and everything. The name of the game is satisfaction, and I'm insatiable. Are you the man to quench my thirst? You know, it's a funny thing. I've been thinking about that. Maybe I'm not the right guy. Maybe you should get hooked up with somebody else. I didn't mean to say hooked! What I meant to say is-- I know. But I think you'll do just fine. Relax. Enjoy it. Oh, I'm really enjoying it. I'm having a swell time. I'm really excited, too. Oh, I'm so sorry. Listen, I gotta be moving. Don't forget to write. See you later. Oh, damn. [ ticking ] [ striking ] [ stairs creaking ] Excuse me? Ahh! You startled me. I didn't hear you. You shouldn't sneak up on a person like that, you naughty boy. Listen, I'm gonna be leaving now, and I'm gonna be taking the car, so when my friends come down, can you tell them to just grab a cab? Something displeases you? No, that's not it. It's just this place isn't exactly my cup of tea. Oh, I know what you mean. There's no reason the evening should be a total loss. [ laughs ] Listen, I'm very liberal-minded. That's okay for you, and it's okay for me. No, I didn't mean that. I mean it's okay by me. No, no, I didn't mean to say "bi." What I mean is bye-bye. I gotta-- - Balthazar! - [ wolf howls ] [ spring pops ] [ thunder rumbles ] Did I hear you say you were leaving? Well, look, it's nothing personal. It's like I was telling the young lady upstairs-- See, back home I have this little girlfriend. Oh, a girlfriend? How cute. Yeah, well, listen, I really had a fun time here, and I really appreciate everything you've done, but I-- You must stay. Look, lady, let's not get our feathers ruffled here. I don't mean any disrespect-- You must stay. Well, perhaps I could come back a little later maybe and-- Stay. I must stay. Stay. [ hisses ] [ both panting ] Ah. Oh. That was fantastic. Did you like it? Like it? At one point, I thought we'd have to call the fire department. Maybe next time we can try something a little more different. I didn't think there was anything-- Anything left. Oh, I don't know. Maybe we could try something with a little more bite in it. Yeah. Like what? [ hisses ] No, no, no! Yes, yes, yes! - [ horse neighs ] - Oh, yes. Ah, ah! Brock: Yes, yes, yes! Yes! Boy, it sounds like they're really having a good time up there, doesn't it? We can have an even better time. Look, I thought I explained this to you. See, I got this little girl back home-- Boy, you really mean business, don't you? Look, I gotta tell you, I'm from a small town in the Midwest. This big-city stuff is all new to me. I can help you adapt. No, look, seriously, I really gotta be moving along, see? I'll write you later. I promise. I'll send you a letter. I'm sorry. He was too skinny anyway. He'll be back. [ wolf howls ] I wonder where the heck those guys are. - [ knock on door ] - Hey, maybe that's them. Maid service, come to clean your room. Look, I'm not quite ready for you now. Can you come back in a few minutes? This isn't gonna be a habit with you, is it? No, ma'am. I've got a schedule to keep, you know? I've got 27 rooms to take care of. This isn't gonna be a habit with you, is it? Look, lady, if you just come back in a few minutes, I'll be all ready for you. Yeah, hello. My name is Kyle, and I-- Oh, great, an answering service. Yeah, hi. My name is Kyle Carpenter, and I called this number last night. And see, a couple of my buddies came by there last night for a session, see, and they haven't shown up yet. And I was wondering if they came back there. Or when you do see them, can you call me back so I'll know so I can get in touch with them, okay? Yeah. My number is 555-1377, room 312. And if you could call me back, that'll be great. And, yeah, it's 10:00-- 10:30 A.M. Tuesday. All right? Thanks. Whew. [ rings ] Hello. Yes, yes, this is Kyle Carpenter. Hold? Okay. Maid service, come to clean the room. You still here? - Well, yes, I-- - I've already rearranged my schedule once. No, no, I know. I really appreciate it, but-- Hello? Yeah great. Look, I'm glad you got my message. - What message? - No, no-- Please wait. No, not you. Look, I need to find out if my friends are at your place. This isn't gonna be a habit? No. No, not you. Yes, yes, we all did come in early. - Since when? - Since last night. No, no, I'm not there now. I'm here. I'll vouch for that. What do you mean, you have no record of the call? Or the session? Is this 555-WETT? You can clean your own sheets. Yeah, but we were there-- Three of us. It's a mansion-type place. The girl I was with was named Kristina. Wait, I was-- All right, you guys want to act paranoid, go right ahead. I was there-- I know. I'm just gonna have to retrace my steps. Okay, lady, you can have the room. It's all yours. I'm off duty now. May I help you, sir? Hi. Remember me? I can't say as I do, sir. It's me, Kyle-- Kyle Carpenter. I was here last night with my two friends. I'm not certain I know what you're talking about, sir. But what about those two girls and the tall lady? Oh, madam? Madam is vacationing in Ibiza, sir. The house is not occupied except for myself and a few other servants. Oh, I get it, shorty. You're starting up a little racket of your own, huh? While the cat's away, the mice will play. Trying to make a little dinero for yourself, eh? Pardon me, sir. Look, all I ask is a minute. Just give me a minute. Maybe I'm totally mixed up, but can I just have a little look around here? Very well, sir, if it will satisfy you. Hey, what kind of a gag is this? What's going on around here? As I said, the house is not occupied. Yeah, but it was last night. Hey, you mind if I have a look upstairs? I'd rather you didn't, sir. Aha! So there is something going on upstairs. I'll be back in a flash. You don't want me to check upstairs, so that's just what I'm gonna do. Just how stupid do you think I am? Kristina? Kristina? Hey, what's going on around here? Madam's little girl. The room's been kept this way ever since she... passed over. Passed away? Yes, quite. Listen, this is the same room I was in last night, but it's not the same room I was in last night. I sure don't know what's going on around here. At the moment, all is at rest. Listen, are you sure you don't remember me and my pals? I'm afraid not, sir. Yeah, well, you're gonna remember us 'cause I'm gonna go get the cops, muy pronto. - [ falling down stairs ] - Ow! Oh! Ah! Help! Oh! Yipes! Ow! Oh! Ow! Oh! Ooh, that smarts. Here, fill this out. Then what? Then you wait 24 hours. 24 hours? What are you talking about? I'm not taking a blood test here. I'm trying to find my friends. It's procedure. You see, we can't act on a missing-persons report for 24 hours till after it's made. Besides, your buddies are probably partying it up somewhere in some hot tub. They'll come back on their own. They wouldn't do that to me, Sarge. Look, can't you at least follow up on that call-girl operation? That's vice. I'm missing persons. Besides, we'd have to have grounds-- Catch 'em in the act. Otherwise it's called harassment. Yeah, but I went back to the mansion. - Were your buddies there? - No, they disappeared. And everything was changed around. It was all different. There you go. Slippery little minx, aren't they? Look, I don't know the exact address, but I know it's somewhere out on Berman Drive. Berman Drive? That's Beverly Hills. This is Hollywood. Out of our jurisdiction. Oh, yeah? Well, I'll go to the Beverly Hills cops then. Yeah? Well, let me tell you something. Beverly Hills cops are real protective of their residents, and they're especially touchy about people coming from out of town. - Oh, swell! - Don't worry, kid. They'll show up sooner or later safe and sound. Think positive. Now get out of my office. You went where? Look, Molly, relax. Nothing happened. And besides, it wasn't my idea anyway. It was just something to do, that's all. That's a fine something to do. Look, if you're gonna be that way about it, I'll just hang up on you. We got a maid here at the motel who can give me that kind of grief. A maid? Oh, will you stop? Now come on, this is serious. You know, the only reason I called you is 'cause I couldn't think of what to do next. Well, did you try going back to that place? Yeah, but it's all different somehow. This guy says he doesn't remember me or the other guys. And it doesn't look like the police are going to be too much help either. Well, maybe the guys will show up... maybe. Yeah, too much of this is too weird. I just have a bad feeling about this, and it's getting worse all the time. Well, don't you know anybody out there who can help you? Hey, wait a minute. Aaron Pendleton, Brock's uncle. Of course. How could I be so stupid? What an idiot I am. Hey, Molly, I gotta run. I love you. I'll call you back later. Bye. But-- Kyle? Kyle? [ dial tone ] What would you do? Wanna go to Hollywood? Is Mr. Pendleton in? Yes, but he's in a very important casting meeting right now. Ah, casting shmasting. I got no time for formalities. But-- But you can't go in there. He'll kill ya! Very nice reading, Miss Smith. Thank you. Now see here, young man, you can't just come barging in here like this. Do you remember me? Oh! Oh, yeah. Yeah, yesterday. Well, I'm sorry. My reader hasn't gotten to your script just yet. Yeah, I can see that. Well, I mean, we're going to be shooting "Motorcycle Sluts" in two more days. Mr. Pendleton, Brock is missing. - Brock? - Your nephew. Oh, Brock. Yeah, and Russell, the other guy I came in with? Missing, huh? Yeah, they disappeared. It's a long story. You see, we were kind of lonesome one night, and we bought one of these sex newspapers, see? And we were reading through it, and it more or less kinda-- Boys, boys, boys, why didn't you tell me you wanted a little entertainment? You could have called me. I could have fixed you up. Well, I guess we weren't thinking too clearly. Oh, I know, I know. Little head doing the thinking for the big head, right? - Ho, ho, ho, ho. Tsk tsk tsk. - Well, you see, the three of us went up to this mansion, see? Way up there. And then we met these three beautiful women. And then I kinda left. I chickened out, see? But those two guys stayed up there. Then I went back to look for 'em, and they were gone. And the people at the mansion won't help me, and I don't know how to get in touch with them. Well, they probably just extended the party, you know? They're probably out there somewhere now - Just enjoying a hot tub. - Hot tubs? What is it with you people and your hot tubs? Listen, I know these guys. They wouldn't disappear on me like this. We had things planned for today. We were all set. Well, did you think of calling the police? Police? Yeah, fat lot of help they are. You know you can't do anything for 24 hours after you file a missing-persons report? There's no way-- Hey, wait a minute, Mr. Pendleton. I'm a nobody out here, but you, you're a big important Hollywood producer. Maybe you could use some of your influence and clout to help me out with the police. With the police? No. Uh, no, I don't think we want to call the police. Don't want to, you know, call in too many favors all at once, you know? No, no, I think that we need to find another plan. Actually, I'll tell you the truth. I think that you may be just overreacting just a little, huh? Overreacting? How can you say that? [ Sherry screams ] Call it intuition. What the hell's wrong with her? Oh. Brock! Are you okay? Fine. Actually I'm not feeling so fine. You don't look too good, sport. Hi, uncle Aaron. Listen, I hope you don't mind-- I stopped by the hotel. The guys weren't there, so thought I'd come by and see you. I'm not feeling so well. What happened to you guys? Well, you know how it was. You were there. We got the sexual thing going, the physical thing, and all of a sudden, blacked out. Don't remember much after that. - You look terrible. - Thanks. - You're so pale. - Feel pale. Wait. You know, it looks like-- Looks like you have no temperature. In fact you're kind of clammy. - Clammy? - Whoa, hold on. What is this right here? Look at that. That's real blood. - You know how it is. - You're hurt, Brock. Girls kind of get carried away and all. - You're definitely hurt. - Excuse me. Ah! [ sucking ] Sorry. Got a little carried away myself. Is there any way we can get a raw steak around here, guys? Ah. Hey, you got one of them-- Them-- What do you call it? Compact? Your makeup's fine, honey. It's not for me. It's for my friend Brock. Oh, in that case... - Here you go. - Thanks, baby. No problem. Pale, clammy, the bite marks on the neck... and no reflection in the mirror. - Ow. - Sorry. Brock, I hate to break the news to you, but I think you're a vampire. - You think I'm a what? - Those women-- The only ones available at night, the call-girl service, the mysterious instructions-- What a perfect setup. I think the one you were with bit you in the neck and you became a vampire. You know, I hate it when that happens. Now wait a minute. Wait a minute. You guys trying to pull a fast one on the old A.P., huh? Is this your way of trying to get me to read that script of yours? No, sir. I'm deadly serious. And to be perfectly frank, I'm very scared. Well, how come if he's a vampire, he's still walking around in broad daylight, huh? I mean, aren't they supposed to shrivel up and die or something? Answer that one for me, smart guy. Well, I don't know. He just got bit last night. Maybe it hasn't taken full effect yet. Maybe he's just an apprentice vampire. You know, my parents said I would never amount to anything. Look at this. What do we do now, Pendleton? Well, I might know somebody who can help us. Who's that? - A priest. - A priest. Yeah, yeah. He was technical consultant on a movie I made called "Teenage Exorcist." Now if anybody knows anything about vampires, he's the man. Sherry? Yes, sir? Listen, sweetheart, I want you to keep an eye on our friend Brock here, all right? Don't worry. He won't bite. Let me rephrase that. Um, I just want to know that someone will be here to take care of him if he wants anything, you know? I mean a drink... of water or something? He's pretty weak. He'll be okay. Anything you say, Mr. Pendleton. All right. Let's go, pal. Yeah. Well, don't take any wooden stakes. [ laughs ] I love this kid. Can I get you anything? Kyle? Kyle? Brock? Anybody? "Spectacular Action Pictures." - [ organ playing ] - [ chorus singing ] Ahem. Oh, Aaron, how good to see you. Please be seated. Well, now are you here for some more advice about fighting Satan? Begone, Satan! [ laughs ] Well, actually, I don't think that we're casting a Satan on this show. We were thinking more in terms of a vampire. Oh, wrong reading, eh? Begone, Count Yorga. Is that better? Yeah, but I don't think we're gonna be able to go for Count Yorga either. What we really had in mind was more the garden-variety kind of vampire. Have you got a script yet or what? Look, to tell you the truth, Father, it's not really a movie. My young friend here thinks that he saw a real vampire. What do you mean, "my young friend here"? You saw Brock. You saw what happened. - Who's Brock? - He's my friend. He's the one the vampires got. Oh, really? I'm telling you the truth, Father-- I saw this guy. He's got two big holes in his neck. He's real pale. He's walking around in a stupor. He looks like all the blood's been drained out of his body. And then we saw him bend over and lap blood up off the ground. Go ahead, tell him. Pendleton, tell him. Well, yeah, really-- Right there, see? I'm surprised at you, Aaron. With all the films you've made with disgusting, stomach-churning, vomit-inducing makeup effects, you're trying to tell me you actually saw two real vampire bites? I wasn't reborn yesterday, you know? Yeah, I guess you're right. Come on, we were a little hasty. Hasty? What do you mean, hasty? We're talking about Brock here. This is my pal. It's your nephew. The next thing you're going to tell me is that he cast no reflection in the mirror. That's exactly right, Father. There was no reflection in the mirror. I tested it. - You saw this? - Yeah. - No. - Well, no, but-- - Yeah. Well, yes-- - Yeah, but-- - No, not exactly. - What-- I didn't see a reflection in the mirror, no. I saw the mirror there. There was a table, there was a chair, but no Brock. When-- When did your friend become afflicted? Since last night. Oh. Then the first 24 hours are nearly up. He's close to achieving full power. So you do believe me, right, Father? When you've encountered as many demons from hell as I have, you learn to take it seriously. Wow. You've actually fought the demons from hell-- The vampires? Well, a vampire by any other name. Oh, they come in various forms, you know? There's mass-murdering religious cults, heavy-metal band, acupuncturists, television evangelists. Whoa. No kidding? You'd be surprised. I once encountered a vampire who disguised himself as an I.R.S. agent. Of course, nobody would believe that he was really a bloodsucking leech. So what do we do now, Father? Well, first you have to arm yourself with the proper weapons. You need sharp pointed wooden stakes, crosses. I'll give you some holy water before you leave. Uh-Huh. And what then? Now your friend Brock, is he safe? Yeah, I guess so. As safe as anybody can be with my secretary. Well, nothing will occur to her, so he'll be safe there. Now I suggest that you return to their lair, to the place where you first encountered them. - That's the mansion. - Exactly. Now if you can find the head vampire-- That's that tall lady I was telling you about. A woman? Oh, dear. They're the worst kind. Why is that, Father? Who do you think created feminism, dear boy? So what happens then? Well, when you meet this head vampire-- The top dog, the big cheese, the super suck, as it were-- Yeah, we-- We get the point. Well, if you can confront that one-- If you can dispatch it from this land of the living to the eternal damnation of the living dead, the rest will be a piece of cake. What about Brock? Oh, well, that's the idea. Then if you can confront this lady vampire in time, perhaps the spell will be broken. Then your friend will be left with nothing but a monstrous hickey. - Russell! - Where? I don't know. He's still at the mansion. I don't know what kind of condition he'll be in. Well, since one of your friends got away, the other one will probably be under double protection. Of course, if they're still feeding on him, it may be too late. Oh, Father! You mean I might have to-- Exactly. But remember, my son, a man hath no greater friend than one who's willing to jam a wooden stake through his heart. Really. I'll try and remember that, Father. Yeah. Well, we'd better get going. Oh, Aaron, before you leave, I finished another script. Oh, great. Yes, I want you to finish every page of it. It's time for your bath, Father. - [ choir singing ] - God bless you, my child. [ Brock mumbling ] [ muttering ] [ thunder rumbling ] [ wolf howling ] - [ knock at door ] - Yes? - [ door creaks ] - It is I, Balthazar. - Enter. - [ door closes ] Ahem. The chief of police called to ask of the whereabouts of his men. Our little Sammy. He misses his Madam Cassandra. Yes, ma'am. Have you scheduled him in for tonight? Yes, ma'am. You're having him for dinner. Mmm! Good. Maybe we'll settle our business once and for all between me and the Beverly Hills cops. Very good, madam. [ sucking ] Hello? Is anybody here? - [ hisses ] - Kyle? Kyle? Hello? Ahh! - Molly. - Oh, Brock. God, you scared the hell out of me. - What are you doing here? - Kyle called. You had disappeared or something? Don't worry about it. It was nothing. What happened to your teeth? Oh, these? Busted on a piece of corn. Temporary caps-- Didn't have my size. I'll get 'em filed when I get home. Brock, look! Ah, special effects. You know we're shooting a horror film here. - Oh. - Sherry. She's good, huh? You know, Kyle 's going to be real happy to see you. - I've been so worried. - You know, I have, too. Okay, so it's dark out already. All right. It's all right. We're almost there. We're almost there. [ car honks ] Oh. The forces of evil are no match for the power of good. Hey, wait a minute. Yeah, I think I paid good money for that line once. [ thunder rumbles ] [ wolf howls ] What's going on here? Hey, any of you guys seen my camera? - Ha ha! - What's going on? Oh, my God. Hey! Ow! Hey, wait. Wait! Ouch, ouch! - [ all sucking ] - Ah! Ow! Eat, drink, and be merry. - Save some for me. - Aah! [ screams ] Checklist ready? Oh, um, yeah. Shoot. Crucifix? Yeah. Check. - Wow. - [ horn honking ] [ tires screech ] - Sharpened wooden stake? - Yeah, right here. Check. Holy water? Holy wa-- Yeah, check. Okay, then. We're all set. Yeah, now just let some ancient vampire hooker try and pull a fast one on us, huh? Yeah, that's telling 'em. [ sucking ] Mmm. [ wolf howls ] - What are we gonna do? - Kick butt. - What kind of butt? - Vampire butt! - I can't hear you. - Vampire butt! - I can't hear you! - Vampire butt! Shut up. They'll hear you. Come on. Whoo! High five. - Now get 'em, tiger. - Argh! Give me the holy water. You got it. Shrivel up and die, vermin from hell. Oh, I love it when you talk dirty. What'd I do wrong, Pendleton? Maybe he's not a real vampire. Hey, are you a real vampire? Only on Saturday nights. Out of the way, guardian of the underworld. That's telling him. [ thunder rumbles ] Boys, boys, really! All right, where are they? Who? The hell-born fiends of the night. - Who? - The daughters of darkness. I got a good one-- The soulless denizens from the pits of oblivion. Top that one. The undead bloodsuckers from the realms of corruption. - You win. - Thank you. Oh, them? Oh, out. - Out? - Out. - Out. - Yeah, out. And God knows when they'll be back. They never think to telephone or anything. Listen, shorty, I've had just about enough out of you. Oh, really? Pendleton, can you do something with this guy? What'd you have in mind? Use your imagination, sailor. - Okay. - [ gasps ] Ah. Oh, that really was a pistol in your pocket. Where'd you get that? Prop department. I used it in my last flick-- "Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers." Look, it has silver bullets in it. - Isn't that for werewolves? - Yeah, but you never know. They might have pets. Besides, a speeding bullet has no conscience. How profound! Oh, that's early "Superman," isn't it? Right. What're you gonna do with him? Ah. Come on, get in there. I spent years trying to get out of the closet. There's not a straight man left. Now, remember, you try to come out of there, and I'll fill you full of lead. Promises, promises! That should take care of him. Come on, let's go find Russell. Listen, Carl, that holy-water gag didn't work too well at the front door. Now maybe we ought to call up Father Ferraro and maybe get a brush-up course on that bag of tricks you're packing, huh? Good. Your time is running out, demonic banshees of the everlasting hellfire. - Pretty good, huh? - [ clock chiming ] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, Father Ferraro. Aaron Pendleton here. Yeah-- Well, no, actually I haven't gotten around to reading it yet, Father. Well, I think you'll find it a highly inspirational and uniquely uplifting piece that squarely addresses the moral issues of our troubled times with profound insight, imagination, and intelligence... it's been done. ...not to mention a high body count, two car chases, and full-frontal nudity. Well, now that sounds interesting. Listen, Father, actually the reason we called is to discuss that matter that my little buddy and I were talking about earlier. Well, we're actually in the mansion right now, you see? And I want to clarify some of the rules about kicking vampire butt-- Doing vampire business, right? Now we're about to square off with the undead here. So this simple crucifix thing, are you sure that's an adequate defense against this sort of thing? Oh, most certainly. And a potent one at that. Oh, yeah, but will it work? Just looking at it makes them recoil in terror. Of course, the real trick is to make it come in contact with the flesh. Yes, that way they know you really mean business. Of course, with a female, it works exceptionally well if you can just manage to slide it in between her bosoms - And leave it there. - [ metal clangs ] Hmm. And the holy water? Oh, just a few drops is enough, but aim for her face. Ah. Now, listen, about this stake-in-the-heart routine, I mean, we don't have a hammer or anything. I mean, what do we do when we actually come up against one of these chicks? Well, just give it a good solid thrust. Yes, put all your weight behind it. Well, one of you may have to hold her down. Now do we have to really use a sharpened stake, or can we improvise? Well, in case of a rough situation, you may want to experiment with something that's long enough and hard enough to cause sufficient penetration, providing you can ram it home with full force. Now how deep does it really have to puncture to be lethal? Well, eight inches should satisfy. But remember, no matter how much she begs or screams, don't pull it out until she's completely disintegrated. Thanks, Father. Hey, we'll do lunch. May the lord be with you, my son. Yes. Oh! It's time for your hot tub now, Father. [ choir sings ] Well, it looks like there's nobody here. - [ hisses ] - Ahh! Ahh! Fie on me, minion of evil. Aah! [ yelling ] Aaron: Hey, kid, what'd you do to her? She's bleeding guacamole. Ow! Eat crucifix, bitch. Ow! Wow. Thanks for all your help, Pendleton. I just wanted to see how you handle yourself, kid. Ow. - Russell: Ow! - That sounds like Russell. Come on, yellow-belly, let's go find him. Wait a minute. There might be some of those babes with terminal overbite. We're going to have to locate the boss vampire if you want to save Brock. I've been thinking about that. Tell me something. How much do you really like Brock? Eh, come on. It's awful quiet in here. Maybe they left already. Yeah, I think the worst is behind us now. Hey... Why don't you come with me if you want a blowjob? I always wondered who you had to -- to get off this movie. Ah! Then again, maybe they're still here. That's okay, 'cause I'm ready for 'em. Oh, little boy? Don't be afraid. I'm not going to hurt you. I just want to bite your neck and drink your vital juices and make you my sex slave for all eternity. Hey, hey, be careful. You're messing up my hair. But I can make you feel like you've never felt before. - [ pants zing ] - Ooh, I felt that before. Is that a stake in your pocket, or are you just glad to see me? Ha ha! It's a stake. Now die, bitch. Ah! My, that's a big one. Aah! Boy, what a waste. - Eh! - Hey. Ah! Ow! Russell, you poor little schnook. Look, I know what you're thinking, but it's not so bad. I mean, there are a lot of fringe benefits here, if you know what I mean. - Stay back. - I thought I was your friend. I mean, we go way back. Am I right? I mean, why not continue for centuries? I don't think so. We could be blood brothers. I'd rather just keep it casual. All you need is a little persuading, huh? Ah! And I lent you my roller skates. Aw, gee, Russell, I feel bad enough already. Okay, who's next? I'm locked in a closet here, and outside in the house there's violence, death, and bloodshed, and horror. Rats, and I'm missing it all. What the hell is going on here? Can't you see I am entertaining? I came to end your reign of terror once and for all. And I'd like to get my friend's gold card back too if that's okay. I know you, young man. You're the one that couldn't quite make it the other night. I already explained that to you-- I got this girlfriend back home. I am so sick and tired of hearing about that little bitch. You resisted my affection last time, but now you will belong to me. [ sucking ] You don't impress me. Well, I'll have to just try harder. Ah! [ spring boings ] Ha! I figured you'd try something like this. Aah! Aah! I'll be right back. Aah! [ hisses ] You're going to pay for this, kid. Oh, yeah? You're the one that's going to pay. I'm gonna grind you into hamburger. Here you go, lady. Have some Pope soda. Aah! [ screaming ] [ scream fades ] Hey, this stuff is great. Brock: Kyle? Kyle? Kyle, come on out. Are you here? Hey, Kyle? - Molly, Brock! - Yeah, great. Molly, what are you doing here? I flew out after your last call. I was so worried. Are you all right? I'm fine. Brock, buddy, how you doin'? I feel fantastic. Oh, good. Father Ferraro told me if I killed the boss vampire, - Everything would be okay. - Who's Father Ferraro? I'll take you out to breakfast. I'll explain everything to you there. - Come on. Let's go. - [ clock chimes ] [ both hiss ] Let's get him. Who'd have thought I'd get the last shot in this movie? [ upbeat music playing ]
