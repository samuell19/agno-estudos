(DOG WHINING) (CLICKING AND SOFT GRUNTING) (EERIE MUSIC) (INSECTS CHIRPING) (FAINT CLICKING AND CHIRPING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) You people, where did you all come from? (SOFT MUSIC) (PHONE RINGING) Hello, Robert. Hey beautiful. How are you? I'm alright, how are you? Good. You look beautiful, as always. Mm. Why'd you call me, Robert? Well honestly, I wanted to invite you to a party tomorrow night. But now that I'm seeing you, I'd like to see you now if that's possible. I can't get you out of my head. I wanna see you like that night out at your dad's cabin. You remember, the hot tub, that little skirt you were wearing, all the things you weren't wearing. It was so hot that night. I could literally watch the sweat evaporate from your belly button and the little birthmark on your back that looks like a little eclipse. You know what I'm talking about. What? Are you drunk? Well, it doesn't matter. You can't tell me you don't remember that. That was a long time ago, Robert. And no I don't remember that. But I guess some people change. I haven't changed. Yeah, exactly. There appears to be quite the frenzy here at J. Marion Hospital where 12 people who claimed to have fallen from the sky have been admitted into the facilities and are now being escorted by the police and staff. Now none of these people have been identified yet, and there have been several reports within the last 24 hours of similar incidents taking place around the world. Now U.S. officials have yet to make a comment on the matter as the President of the United States is set to make a statement later tonight. Now many people have begun to speculate that these people from the sky are somehow connected to the strange sounds that have been heard around the world in the last four days. As you can see, there's quite the commotion going on around me here at J. Marion. We are witnessing a global. What sounds like something out of a science fiction novel is a reality throughout the world and in our backyard. You know this whole sounds from the sky thing, it's kinda ridiculous. No one even knows where they're coming from, - no one knows what to do. - Is it even real? I think they're actually making it up. - I think so too, honestly. - I can hear it. Hey, how are all my favorite ladies doing, including you? Ladies. One for you, punk. Hell yeah. This one's to naked people from the sky and my future baby from above. STEVEN: I'm Steven Farris for Channel 2 News, live at the J. Marion Hospital. What, don't you wanna just chill with me? What are you doing here? Whoa, the sounds are alive tonight. Oh yeah, boys. I got an idea about those sounds. Every time we hear a sound, we gotta chug down a beer. BUDDY: Oh yeah. You would lose. That's for sure. Hey, is that Lorraine? You remember her. BUDDY: Didn't she move like eight months ago? It was a year ago. Yeah. MAN: That was right before her sister died, right? ROBERT: Who's that guy she's with? Have you ever seen him before? He seems like a bigger punk than you, though. I got some ideas. Let's see your ideas. Please, you remember what happened last time. No, I was drunk, I hardly remember anything. You peed your pants! (LAUGHING) Really? Exactly. No, you don't get any more drinks. Just get me one. Okay, I'll be right back. Whoops, sorry. LORRAINE'S DATE: Come on! Looks good on you. Been a long time. That was really low. Lorraine. Let me as you a question. This should be good. Why did you leave? Let's see, you were arrogant, pompous, possessive, - a womanizer. - Not that. Need I say more? The club, URS, everybody. You guys were a force. That wasn't a force, that was a circus. Something real. Those guys kept me on constant run around with random evidence about supernatural bullshit. You don't believe that for one second. And you're gone for a year and you show up with that guy? Are you serious? Maybe? What's it to you? He's not even a man. You jealous? I don't get jealous. You are so jealous. You miss me so much. You wish. Look at him, he's probably gay. You're right, he is gay, and he's my cousin, and he's more of a man than you will ever be. Whoops, sorry. (EERIE THRUMMING) (EERIE THRUMMING) (EERIE MUSIC) REPORTER: There's been a lot of buzz over the last few weeks about strange sounds being heard in the atmosphere. People around the world and here at home have reported hearing some bizarre noises. Do you think this might be real? The latest were reported in the Battlefords last weekend. I think they're extraterrestrials. Extra what? Extraterrestrials. It's so obvious. It's coming from the sky, what else could that mean? Girls. Valerie, stop, you're scaring your sister. There's no such thing as aliens, it's just the news. They're just making up stories to sell articles. There's nothing to worry about. How do you know, Mom? Because I'm a grown up, and grown ups know these things. And how old are you? I'm 40, and 40 is a long time. I have a lot of knowledge up here. I've seen a lot of things. Well, I'm 13, and I think I'm wise enough to know there might be extraterrestrials or any other type of things. This is not fake, Mom. You are old enough to know not to scare your little sister, okay? So no more talk of aliens. I'm just preparing for the future. Well, I'm going to prepare for my future, too, because I'm gonna go upstairs and take a shower. You girls finish eating, 'kay? Dishes in the sink? REPORTER: I've heard that Jesus is coming back. I've heard that the world is ending. I'm right. REPORTER: This phenomenon stretched beyond North Battleford. Similar experiences were reported in Saskatoon, Northern Saskatchewan, and parts of the U.S., even in Europe. U of S Professor Jean Pierre Sanmarie says there is a natural explanation. (RUMBLING) (OMINOUS MUSIC) (SIREN WAILING) (FAINT CHATTERING) You hear it? (ANXIOUS MUSIC) (STATIC CRACKLING FAINTLY) We're all in. Lorraine, hey, listen. Hi Lorraine. Yeah, good to see you last night. Um, unfortunately didn't get to say hi. Not a big deal, lots of people, lots of things going on. Not offended. We just wanted to send you a quick video and let you know that we really need you back in our group. There's something going on and we know that you heard the sounds in the sky the other night. This is huge, Lorraine. I'm serious, we are on to something and without you we cannot do this. This is what we've been waiting for. This is what we have been waiting for! TERI: We need you, Lorraine. Something big is about to happen. We can feel it. Listen, we know with everything that happened you needed time and space, and we respect that. But this, this is what we created this group for to begin with, and without you we are incomplete. It's true, Lorraine. You were the glue that held us together. The four of us, yeah. And we really need you. Plus we need you for your geographical sense. You knew exactly where to look, you knew exactly where to go, and we need our leader back. - Yeah, seriously. - We need our powers combined. That is the key, we need our fourth member. So we expect you to call us back, tonight. Please call us, Lorraine. We love you and we miss you. ROY: Call us, love you. TERI: Bye. (SOFT PENSIVE MUSIC) Excuse me, miss. Hi sweetie, how can I help ya? Um, do you have any books on aliens and stuff like that? That's all the craze today with all the noises in the sky. Um, you know, I think the last one has been checked out. Um, oh, you know what? Actually, that gentleman right there, he actually has the last book. I'm sorry, sweetie. Yeah, that's a great book, what do you think? MAN: Well, I'm trying to figure out what happened this morning. Did you see anything? I just heard stuff. I don't know, it's pretty crazy though. MAN: I know, it's weird. WOMAN: Those sounds, they're just so scary. MAN: I know, I heard 'em all last night. MAN: They said they heard 'em all over the world. WOMAN: I just have no idea what to think about it. MAN: It's so weird, have you heard 'em? WOMAN: Oh, I have. MAN: (FAINT SPEAKING) ...different directions. WOMAN: It does, it just keeps me awake at night. I don't know what it... MAN: You scared? (FAINT SPEAKING) WOMAN: You think it's the end of the world? VALERIE: Rosie, what are you doing here? I'm selling chocolates for my school fundraiser. Okay, I'm not gonna buy one, so why are you talking to me? Mom also sent me here to tell you to go pack for our field trip tomorrow. You know you could have called me, right? But you never answer my calls. Well. You know what, just go. Okay. Wait. Rosie, come here my beautiful sister. (PLAYFUL MUSIC) Hello sir, would you like to buy some chocolate for my school fundraiser? How much are they? They're one dollar each. I can go for that. Thank you. Alright. I'd like to check out these books, please. (PLEASANT MUSIC) (STATIC CRACKLING) (STATIC CRACKLING AND WARBLING) (GRUNTING) Sorry. Oh my God, I'm so sorry. Are you okay? Yeah, it's fine. But what are you doing? I'm just trying to track long range sounds in the sky, what are you doing? Oh, I'm just reading. It's peaceful down here. Young girl reading alone in a secluded field? Interesting. Wait, I know you. You're Lorraine Garder from the Unexplained Research Society at the college, right? It's Gardner, and not quite. That was just a silly little hobby that I did a while ago in school. Then what are you doing? I don't know. Good question. Well, I'm Valerie. Those sounds you're hearing, what are they? Honestly, I don't know. But they could be extraterrestrial. I knew it. Do you think this might be the end of the world? Who's to say? I can tell you this much, if it was the end of the world I wouldn't be anywhere near this city. Those sounds that we've been hearing sound really hostile. It's not a safe place. And where would you go? I don't know. My father owns a cabin in Cayo Woods, probably go there. It's secluded and safe. See you around, Valerie. (UNEASY MUSIC) Where the hell is Cayo Woods? Well, we're all hearing the sounds. They're coming from all over the place, all over the world. But what are they? And we ask ourselves that with no possibility of a good answer or definite answer. The governments of the world don't know what the hell is going on, and they cannot come to any kind of agreement. But these beings are among us, they are here, they are in the clouds, they are in the sky. Now they have no carnal nature, they don't have any fixed form, but what they are is millions upon billions of tiny alien molecules, and they're here, and they have traveled billions of light years across space to come here. It's the first alien visitation we have ever had on this planet, and it looks as if they are here to stay. I'm sorry, but I think this guy is full of crap. Really? Yeah. I mean, did you listen to this guy? What is he saying that makes any sense? It's all theories. He's using this as a reason to get on his soapbox and preach fantasy. Where's the proof? - Proof, right. - Yeah, the proof. There's been an incredible temperature drop in the atmosphere. There's absolutely nothing this guy's saying to back up his theories! (KNOCKING ON DOOR) It's bull! I'm sorry. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Dude, it's a chick. Teri go hide somewhere. Hi, um. Hello. Are you guys members of the Unexplained Research Society? Actually, we are. We are the founding members. And this is Teri. Okay, great, because I have something you guys are really gonna wanna see. (UNEASY MUSIC) Oh my gosh, those are the molecules you guys. Oh my God, do you see this? These are the molecules! That is a blatant beam of green light. There's nothing molecular about that. We have to get this out there. We have to get this out there. No, you know what happens right now if we take this viral? We take this viral, a bunch of people are gonna say a bunch of kids got stoned and made a video with some green light and put it on line. No one's gonna take it seriously. TERI: She has the proof right here, she took this video herself. This is not proof. Right now this is the equivalent of that dude and his freaking molecules. Molecules, huh? That's possibly the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Let me guess, Doctor Mathis' theory, right? You guys, these things aren't lost, and they're certainly not molecular. These things are living, breathing organisms with just one purpose, and that's to study us. Okay, well then how'd you come up with that conclusion? The right answer's usually the obvious one, Teri. These sounds from the sky, they all differ from one another. They all have similar rhythmic patters and structures, it's not right. Hooper, it's like a French man and an Italian man speaking English to one another. It's not their language, but they're still communicating. What are you trying to say? I'm saying that it's a broken communication between beings of the same species. Aliens. Big green space invaders. Is that what you're saying? Well not exactly big or green or of any particular shape, just beings of highly advanced intelligence. Right, so why is it they haven't made contact yet? Who's to say they haven't already? Lorraine, not the 1967 theory again, come on. It's possible. What theory? In 1967, this group of people came out of nowhere and they claim that they were abducted by aliens, okay? Aliens from the future. They saw bright lights. Which is basically what's been happening right now with all these people from the sky. So what happened back then? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. They were just all deemed mentally unstable. Wait, so what you're saying is that the other night what I actually saw was a... An unidentified flying object. That's crazy! It's out of this world. Alright, so say that this is really happening. I mean, we need to try to look into this. We need to try to set up some interviews or, I don't know, get some samples, audio samples, anything, I don't know. I developed an app that tracks all the sound patterns in the sky, we can use that. Nice. TERI: Sweet. But I think we need to get in touch with one of these people that claim that they've fallen from the sky, today. That's impossible. They've basically been quarantined. Well, the media coverage for this story has been ridiculous. Right. I mean, if we're really gonna try to get in that hospital, there's nothing we can do other than to sneak in. Sneak, huh. What? I think I have an idea. (UPBEAT MUSIC) Sorry we are late, but (MUMBLING) was absolutely ferocious. Ashton Cranberry, world renowned celebrity film making documentary film maker, and this is my team. We have Bipsy, makeup artist galore, we have Nugget, cinematographer, and we have Bill. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) And last, but not least, we have my personal assistant, Cookie. Right, I'm Cookie. Pleasure. May we proceed? Can I help you with something? Can you help us with something? Yes, you can take me directly to my personal, private interview with Mr. Wexler. Welder. Mr. Welder. I'll be right back. Let me go ask him. Time is money! Time, tick, tock! Tick... Imagine if worn like a suit? Ravishing! I have some people here. They wanna talk to you for an interview. Is that okay? Uh, yeah, yes. Okay. Mr. Welder, hi, my name is Ashley Swanson, we're with World Kraus Magazine. BOB: Hi. This is my team. It's so nice to meet you. Hi. It's a pleasure. We were hoping to ask you a few questions, if you don't mind. Sure, that's fine. Um, I don't have seating for all of you, but... - No, you're fine, it's okay. - Not a big deal, no, no. Well, sit, please. So are they treating you nicely here? It's primitive, but it's adequate. Is the hospital food alright? Now come on, you really didn't come here to ask me about food, did you? No, nah. Mr. Welder, truthfully we wanted to come here today and ask you if yo could tell us if you remember anything from that night? All I can tell you is that it felt like a feather blowing in the wind amidst this great storm, and it was beautiful and it was terrifying all at once. Terrifying? Um, some things are better left unsaid. Have you seen any of your family since? Um. Surely, the hospital's tried to contact them for you? No. No, no. Listen, we didn't mean to offend you. No, no, no. I'm not offended at all. There have been rumors that you have been from the future? You know what, I like you. So I wanna tell you a secret. I am from the future. Now ask me what year? What year? I'm from the year 2074. (GASPING AND LAUGHING) RICHARD: This changes everything! How? It's true, I don't know how. You gotta remember something. - Remember, please! - Tell us about it. How? Mr. Welder, would you say that you had an extraterrestrial experience? (EERIE MUSIC) RICHARD: Hey, are you alright? Yes. Yes! Yes, I saw them! Creatures! Get back. I saw them! No, back! They tore at my soul! They don't believe me! Don't touch me! You don't believe me! I saw them, it's true! I saw them! (BIRDS CHIRPING) (MELANCHOLY MUSIC) (PHONE BUZZING) You're too cool to answer your phone? I really just needed to be alone, Robert. Just get away from all that. Have some serious radio silence, you know? It is really beautiful up here. Yeah. This view, it really makes you think, doesn't it? You ever really wonder what's out there? All I know is that it's something far greater than anything we could ever comprehend. You know there's these people on the news popping up everywhere, claiming to be some kind of accidental time travelers. Can that even happen, like time warps and stuff like that? It's happened before. Yeah? Back in 1967. I was doing some research and I found that eight people came out of nowhere claiming to be from the sky. They were bruised, beaten, disoriented. They were just brainwashed. And yet their case still remains open. I don't know. I really feel like these sounds from the sky are what are causing these people to go crazy. Is that what you really think? (MOVES INTO THOUGHTFUL MUSIC) Skylar, can you please put your phone away? Mind your own business. Ms. Duvall. Skylar, put your phone away unless you wanna lose it. Hello? Hi. May I help you? Uh, yes, actually. We're here to meet with Ms. Laura Deming. Oh, are you with the URS? Yes ma'am. I've been expecting you kids. Please, come inside where it's warmer. Yeah, we'll only be here a little bit longer. I'm thinking about six, maybe a little bit after. Is that okay? Mrs. Duvall, we're bored. When are we gonna leave? You're bored because you're just sitting there. Try getting up, moving around, play a game. It's so cloudy, it's gonna rain. It's not gonna rain. Wanna play tag? Yeah, let's go ask Valerie. Hey Valerie. You wanna play tag? No. Do you see what I'm doing right now? I'm reading a book. Can't you read it later? You could. No, because I'm actually having so much fun. - Come on! - Please! Stop, please. Just come play with us. Come on! SKYLAR: We can go on a walk if you want. You know, actually I think it's about to rain, and we don't wanna be caught out in the rain. No, I just think it'll be better to be away from them. Okay, I'll play. What are you guys playing? - Hide and go seek. - Hide and go seek. Oh, I'm in! - You're it. - You're it. That's not fair. - You were last. - You were the last one. What? Ah! That's such a dumb kid's game. Alright, I'm in. (SOFT MUSIC) Thank you for welcoming us into your home, Ms. Deming, and for offering to share some of your experiences with us. May I offer you some tea? I'm okay, thanks. I'm fine. I have red, green, black, peppermint, peach. I'm good, really. Seriously, cool. Okay, red then. Is she crazy? I don't know. (LAUGHING) No, no, I'm not crazy. No, I just haven't had company in a while. It's called hospitality. Drink the tea. I know you didn't come here for tea. You came here to find out if I've made contact with extraterrestrials. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. (SOARING MUSIC) Ready or not, here I come! I think I hear you guys! Tell us everything you know. It was about eight months ago. My husband and I were hiking by the old power house. It's an old decayed building now. It was early in the morning, the sun wasn't out yet. I saw a shooting star. No, actually we both did. And then another, and another. It was like a beautiful meteor shower. Until they started coming closer, and closer, until you could almost touch them. We followed one into the building. We were petrified, but something told us to keep goin. Were the lights of any particular shape? No. I don't remember. When we finally went into the building, everything stopped. The lights went out, the air became thick, almost unbearable. It was like they were watching us. Who's they? The visitors. Zoey? MS. DEMING: When the lights suddenly came back on. Skylar? MS. DEMING: We were blinded and I fell to the ground. That's when I saw my husband being sucked into the light. You saw your husband abducted by aliens? (OMINOUS MUSIC) Before I fled the building, I saw one of them standing in front of me. He was waiting for me. He wanted me to be afraid. He was enormous in size, and... Thick skinned, green. Almost reptilian. Would you like to see it? (RAIN PATTERING) (CHIRPING AND CLICKING) (THRUMMING) (THUNDER RUMBLING) Ms. Duvall! What? I don't know, I just heard something really, really afraid in the woods, and it's... You heard something in the woods? Yeah, yeah. We all did! (KIDS CHATTERING) Okay, calm down, calm down, I'll go look. No, Ms. Duvall, I think we should just go. No, it'll be fine. (KIDS CHATTERING) It's probably your imagination, just stay there, okay? No, Ms. Duvall, don't. We should get back in the car. You heard it over here? Yeah. Ms. Duvall, I don't think that's a good idea. IAN: Really, you don't have to do this. We should probably go. - We should just leave. - Yeah, we should probably go. I don't hear anything, but I think we should get to the car, okay, guys? ROSIE: Okay. (EERIE THRUMMING) (SCREAMING) KIDS: Holy shit! Oh my God! And we're headed west. ROY: Can we not head west? AVA: Yeah, why are we headed west? RICHARD: Ask her. Well, I've been collecting and mapping out the patterns of the alpha sounds that we've been hearing, and it seems as though they've been originating from the more desolate areas of the Midwestern United States. Really? Okay, desolate like where? That's vague. I'm thinking the outskirts of Indiana. - Indiana? - Oh, boo! - Indiana? - Stop. Why would we go to Indiana? Well, if these patterns continue, I'm betting we're gonna find our next sound blast there. RICHARD: I doubt that. Indiana. Really, I don't know, Lorraine. I mean, what about all the sounds we've been hearing coming from the city as well? Well those sounds are really subtle, and as we travel west the sound frequencies have just been getting significantly stronger. ROY: Well listen to you, you sure don't sound like somebody who quit the group. Whatever. Listen, you lead the way and we will follow, even if it means that we're going to Indiana. TERI: To Indiana. The Captain's back, baby. Let's do this! Let's do this road trip! Road trip, ha ha! GROUP: Indiana! (GROUP WHOOPING) (HEAVY BREATHING) What do we do? I don't know. Like, where are we going? Okay, I don't know. - Stop freaking out! - What just happened? We're gonna be fine. - Where are we going? - What was that? I don't know, I don't know. We're lost. Thank you. (ADVENTUROUS MUSIC) Alright, let's get this show on the road. Alright, you got that tube? This is expensive, expensive craftsmanship. AVA: Oh yeah. Got that? RICHARD: Yeah. ROY: Alright, looks good, guys. Yeah, let's do this thing. Let's go. I think we need to go a little bit farther. Hey, I see a clear patch over there. I was thinking if you wanna set up shop, send her up. (FAINT SPEAKING) Alright. Alright guys, headphones up. Get anything? A little bit, yeah. Something. ROY: It's quiet, we can pick something up though. I can send her up. Yeah, take her out. Yeah. Alright, ladies and gentlemen, for those of you who may not have had the pleasure of meeting her before. Roy, just take it out. I hereby give you, Jody. AVA: Jody? Ooh, she's feeling feisty this morning. No wonder you don't have a girlfriend. Hey man, you thank your mom for all that Tupperware you stole for this crap? Alright, guys, I think we need to spread out. Hooper, go south. Got it. You guys go that way, I'm gonna go north to a higher altitude. Alright. Want me to send her up? Yeah, take her by me. Right when I get to the top of the hill. Alright. There she goes! Come on, yes! (DRONE BUZZING) Go! There's my girl! Teri, what is all of this? Okay, so these are parabolic microphones. Okay. They're gonna intensify the sounds that we're getting in the sky and send them directly to our headphones. Cool. Can I take something? You know what? Film everything. Okay, I can totally do that. Guys, do you hear that? I think it's getting louder! Roy, fly directly above me. Right there, a little higher! (STATIC WARBLING) I think I'm getting something. Oh, I'm definitely hearing something. You hear that? (THRUMMING) What was that? You guys hear that? Whoa, whoa, whoa. That was not me! What's that? She's fightin' back, hold up. What was that? My drone. (RUMBLING) Oh my God. (SOARING MUSIC) Run! (FRANTIC MUSIC) Lorraine, bolt! Come on, come on! TERI: Okay, come on, let's go. Go now, let's go. Move this car! Oh! Where is Lorraine? Come on, come on. Come on, jump! Jump! Jump! TERI: Go, go, go, go, go! Are you okay? Go, Hooper, just drive. Drive, step on it. Go, go, go, go, go, go! TERI: Hooper, don't slow down! Oh my God. ROY: Go, go. (ALIEN BEAM THRUMMING) What's that? What is it doing, what is it doing? What is it doing? TERI: Where is it going, where is it going? ROY: Oh my God. Is there anymore? ROY: What just happened? - What just happened? - That just happened? That just happened. (TRIUMPHANT MUSIC) Oh my God. That just happened! (YELLING AND CHATTERING) We're gonna be famous! Let me see the photos, let me see the photos. Wait, where's the camera? I thought you grabbed it. Damn it. It's getting dark soon. Hey, Ian, do you see that orange spot? IAN: See what, I don't see an orange spot. It's right there, it looks like a car, or a bus. Let's check it out. I think it'd be a better idea if we just stay here for the night. I'm tired, you're tired, I'm sure everyone else is tired. We just need to chill, okay? I'm scared though. Like the scaredest you've been in your life? I'm afraid what my mom's thinking. How worried she is. My little sister, how's she taking this. Well, it kinda reminds me of when I was five or six. It was the family reunion, everyone was meeting up at Grandma's house before we'd all go to the park from there. But they forgot about me and they left me there. It was scary, of course, but I wasn't scared because they forgot about me. I was scared because there was nothing that I could do about it then. I guess I just wasn't important to them in the grand scheme of things. It stupid, just forget about it. (SOFT MUSIC) Open the door, quick, quick, quick. Oh, hey. - I gotta call my mom. - It's okay. It's not okay, it's not okay! I gotta call my mom. AVA: Call your mom? Oh my God, she's gonna be so freaking proud of me. Alright, everyone just calm down. Proud of you? Calm down. (GROUP TALKING OVER EACH OTHER) We gotta find out what's going on. You guys, shh. Roy, get off the phone. ANNOUNCER: This is a national emergency. Important instructions will follow. (CIVIL DEFENSE SIREN WAILING) Hooper. Oh my God. This is happening. They're everywhere. ROY: This is big. ANNOUNCER: Providing news and information for the public in assigned areas. ROY: There's one over New York. ANNOUNCER: This is KJO-TV. We will continue... ROY: This is planned. This is planned. It has to be. They must have planned this. They know what they're doing. ANNOUNCER: News and information for your local area. You are listening to the emergency alert systems serving the San Francisco, Port Townsend, Seattle. I don't know. We need to figure out a game plan. How do you make a game plan around an alien invasion? ANNOUNCER: Oregon, Crescent City, Eureka, and San Diego, California. This is an update to the previous alert. It'll be okay. It'll be okay. ANNOUNCER: If you are more than 100 miles from any of the previously mentioned cities, consider evacuating the area. (SNORING) (SOFT MUSIC) You're lookin' at pictures of Ellen? I didn't know you were awake. I'm sorry. That's okay. It doesn't get any better, does it? No. ROY: I'm sorry. I really miss her. She would have really loved this. When we were younger, when we used to sneak out late at night and pretend to chase UFOs with our fake microphones. I used to do the same thing with my siblings. Really? Yeah. We never would have thought that we'd see something like this. What do you think exactly's going on? All of this. You really think this would just come out of nowhere without some kind of organized plan? I don't know. There's no telling what their motive is. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't scared. Me too. It'll be okay. SKYLAR: Is it a bus? IAN: The lights are on. VALERIE: Oh my God, oh my God. ROSIE: I don't think there's anybody there, though. VALERIE: Excuse me! (KIDS SPEAKING AT SAME TIME) Okay, we need to get to the city right now, please! Please take us to the city, please, please! Just drive, right now. We need to go. We'll explain everything on the way. Let's go, sit down. Calm down, please! We're going, let's move it. Lorraine, listen. (CIVIL DEFENSE SIREN WAILING) It's Robert. Call me back as soon as you can. Everything's going crazy, I have no idea where you are. Everyone's been evacuated to the city, this whole neighborhood's already gone, and I have no idea where you are. I'm going downtown to see whatever I can find out. You need to stay safe and call me as soon as you can. Just meet me in the city if you get this, if you don't call me back. Just stay safe, whatever you do. (UNEASY MUSIC) TERI: I wonder when there's gonna be another sighting. Have you seen anything yet? It's all over the news. Right over Jody. You see that one? It's huge. ROY: They floated after us in a space ship. This things are more than advanced, dude, these things are... How big do you think that ship was? Like, it was massive. I just don't understand how this seems so planned, you know? This seems very organized. These things are appearing at the same time. TERI: All of a sudden out of nowhere. AVA: Yeah, it's being, like, coordinated. (STATIC WARBLING) Wait! Wait, what is that? What? TERI: Are you getting something? Yeah. What does it sound like? Is it just sound like mechanical? What is it? Is it another one of the space ships? I don't know. They're really strange, you guys. TERI: This one's different than what you've been hearing? Yes, very very different. These aren't like the sounds we've been hearing. I think, I think it's coming from that building over there. Hooper, drive that way. HOOPER: That way? LORRAINE: Yeah, I think we need to go check it out. That looks like a hot spot, go over there. ROY: Dude, pull over. Yeah, yeah, head over for sure. RICHARD: Alright, I'll go there. I'll go there, we'll get there. (UNEASY MUSIC) (STATIC WARBLING FAINTLY) Stay close. (CHAIR THUMPING) Oh! - Hooper! - Come on! LORRAINE: Don't touch anything! Babysitting, geez. Shh, shh, shh, do you hear that? LORRAINE: I hear something. I'm definitely hearing something. I had it just now. It sounded like the same noises we've been hearing. That sounds like voices, guys. TERI: What is it? Unpleasant voices. ROY: There is like two or three of these things registering. Dude, this sounds like voices! Shh! What is that? What is that? Here's a door. It's getting louder. They're all locked. Let's check this out. Hooper. (STATIC WARBLING) RICHARD: You guys hearing anything? I hear something. There's a bunch of static though. It's not the same noise it was before. I don't hear anything. There's definitely something in here. It's almost like pollution from the electricity. Dammit. You know what guys? You know, I hate to be that guy, but, um. What? I say we split up. What, no. No, seriously, think about it. This is a huge building. I wanna get in and out. We just cover as much territory as we can and we go. No, man. We've found stuff from some homeless man living in here. No, I agree with Roy. I think we need to split up. Yeah, you know what? I'm gonna check upstairs. Hooper, come with me. We're all gonna die. Be careful. What about you? It'll be okay, come on. Yeah, Ava. We got you. What if the ghosts take me? (UNEASY MUSIC) Hooper? Teri? (UNEASY MUSIC) Lorraine, stay close. Can we go, please? Come on. Shh. Shh. Lorraine, please stay close. Geez! (GASPING) What was that? (AVA WHIMPERING) (YELLING) (SCREAMING) Hey guys. Don't do that to me, I've got asthma, dude. You come out of the shadows like that. TERI: It freaked me out! It freaked you out? You're the ones hanging in all these dark rooms! We were looking for something! We were looking for something! Did you guys hear anything? LORRAINE: No, did you? No. What, so you guys ran into me? TERI: We didn't hear anything. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (SCREAMING) (HISSING) Lorraine! Lorraine! No! Oh God! Go! Lorraine, run! Lorraine! (HISSING) (JET ENGINES ROARING) What's happening? (KIDS SPEAKING OVER EACH OTHER) Can we go faster? You need to go faster! Please, God. Where are we going? Do we even have a plan? What are we gonna do? We are continuing to lose speed! Oh no! I have the throttle to the floor. Relax. How are you supposed to relax? Do you not see what's going on? Drive faster! IAN: Rosie! What are you doing? (CONCRETE CRACKLING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) We have to go! The bridge is cracking! What? SKYLAR: Oh my God! DRIVER: What is that? What's happening? We have to go, go go! I'm sorry, it's stopped! (SPACE SHIP THRUMMING) (SCREAMING) (EXPLOSIONS BOOMING) (SCREAMING) (EXPLOSION BOOMING) (SPACE SHIP THRUMMING) (ALIEN WEAPON SIZZLING) (SCREAMING) (CIVIL DEFENSE SIREN WAILING) (SCREAMING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) This is it, guys. (UNEASY MUSIC) (PLATES RATTLING) MAN: Oh God, what is that? MAN: What is that? (PEOPLE CHATTERING) (SPACE SHIP THRUMMING) It's just this way. (SOFT MUSIC) Here it is. Wait, Lorraine, why is the door open? I don't know. Keep in mind there's a lot of people probably just looking for a place to hide right now. Out here? (GROUP CHATTERING) The city's gone. Shh, shh, shh. Hello? Hello? Is anybody here? Dad? RICHARD: Do you have neighbors or anything? No. ROBERT: I'll check the basement. Hello? The place is empty. Think it was looters or something? You're sure you heard a sound in here? Yes, I did. But I don't wanna go in looking for it! Come on. You gotta figure out if it's something or nothing. Hello? Hello? Come on. I'm fine right here. Whoa! How long have you guys been up here? AVA: Where'd you come from? ROY: So what are you guys doing out here by yourselves? Uh, we were on a summer camp field trip. What is that? Things got a little weird. RICHARD: Give me that! We were just playing hide and seek, and then we watched our camp counselor get sucked up into the sky. ROY: You saw an abduction? So how did you guys end up finding this place? Lorraine just randomly ran into Valerie a way back, and she mention Caya... Oh, Cayo Woods. Cayo Woods. So Valerie just kinda led the way here. Well, I'm glad you guys are here. Alright, you're all set. Do you hear anything? No. I don't think it's working. It's probably 'cause the microphone's not turned on. Oh. Well, how does this work? Well this microphone is rigged into a built in app that I designed a few months ago when we first started hearing the sounds. And what happens is when you turn this microphone on it tracks all the frequencies in the air and transmits it into a visual image there. So that's what you were using last time in the field? Right. That's right. So you wanna give it a shot? Sure. Why don't you climb up there? You'll get stronger frequencies with higher altitudes. Okay. (STATIC CRACKLING) Do you hear anything? Yeah, wow. (SOFT MUSIC) Oh, um, sorry. Uh, they set up the radio if you wanted to come, like, listen. Well I've got some stuff on my shirt. When I'm done. Okay. Sure. Okay, cool. Um, I'll let you do your thing then. (WATER SPLASHING) How we doing in here guys, good? Yeah. Good, yeah, you guys are awesome. The girls are making up food. We'll eat dinner in a second and then we can worry about gettin' out of here. Sound good? Alright, alright. Hooper, got a radio. Come on, man. Hooper, yo! Get over here I need your help with this thing, it's archaic. Oh, that's a Holly '63! No dude, it says Thomas on it. No, it's the model. It's a transistor radio. Alright, I really don't care. Let's just get this thing going. Alright. Alright. So is it working for you? No. RICHARD: This switch should be on, here. ROY: This is not, this is not my genre of technology. Let's try this. (WOOD THUMPING) Man, don't. It usually works. Yeah, it seems pretty reliable, you know? What you got? (RADIO CLICKING) (CLASSICAL MUSIC) Hmm, well, fuck me. What do you think's down there? I don't know. Maybe some weapons. I don't know, I see some boxes. Why don't you go check it out. Okay, yeah. It's freaky down here. (UNEASY MUSIC) Teri, I think I found something. (STAIRS CREAKING) (CRYING) (SOFT MUSIC) Sorry. Sorry for what? Usually I'm the strong one. But I just really miss her. This is the last thing I gave to her before she died. You know this is her room? And this was mine. And I remember I'd get so mad that she would take this from me. Stupid bear that we would argue about all the time. But she loved him. And I just think that if I had just spent less time chasing the unknown I'd be able to spend more time with her. Not your fault. Then why do I feel so guilty? You can't put that on yourself. I shoulda went in there. I shoulda done something. But no, I was too afraid. I was selfish. She died because of me. She was my best friend.
