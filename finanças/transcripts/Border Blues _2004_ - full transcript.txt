I hoped I was leaving trouble behind. But little did I know... let me start from the beginning. Leaving for good? [in Russian] Will you be OK there? [in Russian] We'll see. [in Russian] Scared to start all over again? [in Russian] I guess I am. [in Russian] I have a work permit, if that's what you are worried about. We're not worried about your legal status. Usually we have crimes committed by Russians who call their own translators. I think that Russian detective could be helpful. Look, Mr. Somov, my advice to you is... -bone up on your English... -Improve your English. and I'll talk to my superiors to see if we really need and outside consultant. It was nice meeting you. Thank you. [car beeping] Yo, it's "Go", you moron. You could go, can't you see? I'll ask you one more time, you're gonna go or what? It's not. Stupid immigrant, man. I'll remember you, you'll see, we'll meet up again. Pff! I can do whatever you need. [in Russian] Good morning. Morning? I'm just curious, what do you have in there? In you envelope. Photos of him to show... my family back home. It's great. It's great. [clapping] A beautiful dog. Stay, stay. Stay. Marvo, wait. [Speaking Russian] Excuse me, sir? Are you from Moscow? -Moscow? -Yeah. Sorry, my dog's from Moscow. I thought maybe you knew him. He's usually not so good with strangers. Animals are much more sensitive than people. He just picked up my frequency. You go around sending out frequency? Like a flying mouse? [laughing] We call them "bat" in this country. Now I have some advice for you. I want you to brush up on your English... if you expect to get a decent job in America. What? Have you ever seen the sonic wave? No. Would you ever like to see one? I never thought about it. I've been to the other side twice. Clinically dead. I was surrounded by provinciality, which gave me information that presidents and Czars can't even respond. Very special place. [intense music] It's a bomb in that envelope. What? What bomb? Marvo. Send someone quick. I'm on the corner of Third and Central. Excuse me. This may seem like a silly question. But I need to know the contents of what's in that envelope. -Gotta. -Hey, what's going on? Please, I need to know what's in the envelope. It's none of your business. [punch] [police car siren] -Have a nice day. -Thanks. Mr. Miller, your package has arrived. [explosion] [explosion] This is commander March. I'm on Third of the Central, there's an explosion in the top of the building. I'm working on another thing, remember, I'm the commander. I'm the Chief of police. Now I want everyone in their place when I get back. I'm gonna have a very strong meeting about what's been going on. See you soon. You alright, sir? [sighs] Don't blame yourself, chief. It's just a hunch, who could've known? You call that a hunch? That's why you're a Sargent, I'm still your boss. People die of this. Another fight, probably heading to the border, you want to continue to chase? No, I think it's good we let them bomb another building. [radio reporting] Yeah, the suspect[illegible] That's what we got. Here's what I got. Three days ago, the Times' got the letter... about a corruption scheme in the pharmaceutical business. Pushing ineffective drugs under the market. Now write this down. The letter said to all the pharmaceutical companies... Be aware and prepared, the end is coming. [man smirks] What's wrong with these people? Let's hope this works and get the job done. Captain, I... I think I speak for everybody in the room when I say that none of us question your gifts. We can only imagine what you've been through. Knock on this door and coming back twice. We're just sort of running the catch-up here. We only have the facts to go with, nobody thought of this out of predictive ground. How about preventing it before it happens. My mother taught me when I was very young... never lose my temper. Bet she never met you idiots! Our job is to prevent that crime! And that's the difference between winning and losing. Tell them, I want to invite them to the Russian roulette. OK. This is the address. -OK, will do. -Thank you. Thank you very much. Where's your report on that Bromma guy? Who, sir? Bromma, the guy who wrote the article. That's the guy who terrorized LA. Well, sir, obviously, that name was fake. We don't know that. Go, go, go, go, go. I'm counting on every one of you. Lieutenant, I ran the case files, but I only came up with one Bromma. He ran off with some guys' wife and kid. He filed the report when he couldn't find his daughter. Sounds more like a job for a marriage counselor, not a bomb squad. I still want to take a look at it. -Blason. -Yeah. -The file? -Oh, right. Sorry. That boy. OK, what else have you got? I recently ran a list of everyone fired from, but no one by the name of Brown. But we're stilling following up on that. See if we can get a list of everybody who didn't make into work that day. We should have it in a few minutes. Somov stopped by, he wants us to meet him at the Russian roulette, you want to go? I'm not a gambler. It's the restaurant he works at. Oh, in that case, I'm in. Great. [speaking Spanish] I am tired, Mom. [in Russian] Do you want some water? [in Russian] *FIXME* It's hot. [in Russian] *FIXME* Thank you so much. [speaking Spanish] And now we got this Russian lady and her daughter. She was gonna go with Juan, but since he got busted... Can we help them? Si. I'll be waiting. Okay. -Hi. -Here's some mango for you. They're still green. With a little bit of salt and this knife, they taste very good. Thank you. This is Larry, he will take you to the border. Hi, how is it going? -Hello. And who is this little beauty? -Your daughter? -Yes. Hi, sweetheart, what's your name? [mom] Her name is Lana, and she doesn't speak any English. I bet she'll understand this. Here you go. Here you go, sweetheart. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Have you any bags? Yeah, there. -What's going on? -We gotta get going. Where? My wrench, about an hour drive north. -Is it in America? -No, it's still in Mexico. So why can't we just go to the border? Are you in a hurry go to jail? The Mexican border is very tight today, I can't cross earlier, they'd freeze me head to toe. -Want some [illegible]? -That's not funny. I'm not a comedian. Come on. Did you know Juan well? I hope the price will be the same as what we agreed with Juan. I think you're probably wondering why we want to cross the border. No matter what happens to me, I won't pay more than what we discussed with Juan, okay? Don't worry, the price will be the same. [music playing] [applauding] That was great. -How's the search for Mr. Bromma? -So far not so good. The only Bromma we have in our file fled the country about two years ago... ran off with wife and child of some poor guy named Larry McCrosky. Hmm. I see they let you smoke in this place. Go ahead, smoke yourself to death. -I thought you quit. -I was just asking. It's refreshing to find a restaurant in LA that lets you light up. This is a nice place to work. I would prefer to work in some other place... where people carry guns and wearing badges. They read people their rights instead of their specials. March doesn't trust you enough to let you carry a badge, not to mention a gun. Your friends like this place? -This place is great. -I'm having a great time. It's Victor. Victor asked me to go to Tijuana and buy some tiles for the kitchen. We have a shortage of Russian cases at the moment, why don't you go to Tijuana? I have to find somebody who can take care of my dog. I can do that, you have to go, Tijuana is great. Okay. I'll go. Okay, gentlemen. -Enjoy. -Thank you very much. Have a good time. I gotta toast. To Somov. I don't stay here much, I'm usually in LA, but this is home. If I had known things were going this way, I never had gone with you. I'm sure Juan had a different plan. Juan's plan? If Juan had a plan and then it'll start with something like this... he'll get you crosses the border and put you into some bus to Canada. In Canada, one of his guys get you two visas, get you back to the States legally. Am I right? Of course, I'm right. Rita, I have exactly the same plan. The only difference is, I can make it happen. Juan can't. Anyway, this is your room. If it makes you feel any better, there's a lock on the door. See you guys in the morning. Sweet dreams. Hello. -Hello. -Hi there, doggy. Hi, doggy. How about giving uncle Roy a kiss, give me a kiss. No, please, he doesn't like the smell of alcohol. I have to change that, that's for sure. Come here, boy. What else I gotta know about? You have to feed him twice per day. Once in the morning before he walks, and second time when you come back home. That's easy enough, a lot easier than dealing with my ex-wife, that's for sure. At least, I don't have to talk to him. He likes it when people talk to him. -Yeah? -Yeah. Alright, I'll talk to him then. -Wanna listen to Russian music? -Yeah, it'd be great. Yeah, that's right, me and this big guy, we're gonna be a pair of happy bachelors. -Beautiful. -Nicely done. [phone ringing] Hello, Somov's castle, Sargent McMillan with arms here. Huh-huh. Yeah, must be for you, I don't understand. Hello. Somov, I love when you speak Russian. That language is beautiful. As a matter of fact, I'm going to make my next wife Russian. Can you help me with that? Sure, why not? What's the matter? Something wrong? They denied my son and daughter's visas. They deny her because she's pregnant. That's not a problem, just wait until she has the baby and they can apply again. They already applied, it's twice they did it. Apply the third time. If you gotta hit these bureaucrats all over their heads with these stuff. [door bangs] I forgot to mention this door? Get out, or I'll scream. Scream all you want. I get no neighbors, and the closest village is 40 miles away. [girl talking in Russian] Hi, pumpkin. What do you want from us? I guess what everybody wants. Little respect, little love. Please, let's talk tomorrow. Lana is tired. Tell me something... did you kidnap here? Are you crazy? Why would I kidnap my own daughter? Then why you are so desperate to cross the border? Who are you running from? You running from your husband? I just want to live in America. It's the best country in the world. I hate when people lie, and you are lying. I don't lie. Boo. Why do you think I'm lying. I can tell when women are lying. My wife, Teresa, she was a liar. She ended up running off with a truck driver. So who are you running from? Who are you running from, Rita? I don't have to tell you anything. Believe me, you do. I had to run. If I didn't, I would be dead. Why is that? -My husband. -What? My husband, he embezzled money from a lot of people in Moscow. [banging] [banging] [people yelling] [Rita] When they couldn't find him, they threatened us. They broke all the windows in our apartment. Lana got hurt. [glass shattering] When I went to Russian police, they thought that I was involved they started to investigate me... they search my apartment more than once. Lana started to have nightmare every night. I had a Mexican visa. We were planning to go to The Fairmont Acapulco, so... here we are. Wow. I understand when the parent worry about their child. I have... I have a friend who has a child. She was taken away from him. She was taken away from you? No, no, my friend. What happened? What happened? His wife kidnapped her, that's what happened. He did everything he could. He and the police looked for his daughter for three years. Never found her. I'm sorry. I'm sorry if I came off too strong earlier. I was just... when I saw your daughter... I didn't want anything to happen to her. I was thinking she needs better protection. If you don't care, I don't care. So, have you got the money? -I told you I did. -Show it to me. I'll show it to you, if you leave us alone and get us some sleep. Fine. Are you happy? Hey, Rita, why did you clock the door? Here, give this to Lena. [car beeping] -May I see your paper, sir? -Sure. What's the purpose of this trip? Business, a pleasure. -Uh... tile. -What? Tile, I need to buy tile for the kitchen with "coyotes". Coyote, coyote. -Coyotes. -Coyotes, yes. Yes. You're looking for coyotes? Go to the corner of Las Vacious and Orlando, and ask for Lopez. Okay, is it cheap? Cheap and good, best tile in Tijuana. Okay, to be honest, if it wasn't you, I was just heading to the Lopez place. Oh, you're good to go then. Let him through. Thank you. I'm sorry, are you Fernando Lopez? -Si. -Yeah. What can I help you with? You see, I need this tile. Five hundred with coyote. I don't have so many, if you have patience and wait a little... but, how long do I have to wait? A day, two? Tomorrow, I will have the rest. Maybe. It's the coyote, I'm not so sure about. Coyote. I don't understand. See, somebody told me you need to have a lot of coyote to get you to the States. You are Russian, aren't you? Yes, I am. Yesterday, there's one coyote, he got this Russian lady and her kid across the border... no problem. Oh, I get it. Coyote is the guy who helps people get visas, right? OK, and they can go to the United States. Uh... and you are a coyote. Oh, no, sir, Larry, he's the coyote. He can help you with your visa problems. How much does it cost? Depends, you have to talk to him about that. Where is he? I'll give you address of his ranch, he only lives 40 miles away from here. Hmm. [car beeping] Hey. Hello. Hey, help us. Please, help us. Don't shoot. Fernando sent me. Who are you? My name is Somov. Are you coyote? What do you want? Fernando told me that you can help. Fernando told you that, huh? Yes. You wanna talk, get in the car. Now, I'm gonna ask you this just once. Who are you? Why do you want to cross the border? I see you've got California plates, what's that about? I'm looking American visa for my kids, they're in Russia. Huh-huh. They haven't been able to get any. So you're Russian. Yeah. Look, I don't do visas. I just help people cross the border. Sometimes in a trunk. -Follow me? -Yeah, I understand. I'm sorry, I made a mistake. Then get the hell out of here and stop wasting my time. Hey, what's up? What's all the screaming about? I don't want to be locked up and sit in the room all day. I didn't lock you, you have to lock yourself in, remember? -Time to go. -I don't want to go with you. I will go back to the town by myself. Forty miles in a desert on foot? I'll manage. You might, but she won't. It's none of your business, okay? If you won't let us go, I'll call the police. The police? I think you forget you're in this country illegally but if it makes you feel better. Give them a call. GO ahead, call them. But I have a visa, okay? You had a visa. Fernando said it was expired a long time ago. Let's go. But I was looking for my husband by the way. I have a reason. That changes everything. I'm sure the Mexican police will be quite understanding. You're not going to kill us, are you? No, I'm not. I'm just gonna get you cross the border. End of story. Lena, Lena. -Promise me something. -What? -Don't turn her against me. -What are you talking about? Juan promise me. -Okay, I promise. -Alrighty, then. Let's go. Going on a trip. Such a big girl. Here we go. Mom, hop in. Lena. Larry, I forgot to ask you... how much do you charge? We'll talk when I get back. [girl talking] [Larry] Okay, we gotta go. Bye. Damn Russian. What were you talking about? I didn't say anything. What did he say? He said that he's going to rescue us, he's an undercover cop. Is that so? What are you doing? I'm just clearing our way. He didn't say that, he just asked what city I was from. I told you I can tell when people are lying, and you are lying. I hate when people lie. I just hate it. Here we go. Damn Russian. No, Victor, he doesn't actually work for us. So... right, I understand. I'll see what I can do. Sure. Just how I want to pend my day off. [phone rings] Hello. Listen, I just got a disturbing call from Victor, remember in Russian roulette? He hasn't heard from Somov. Have you? No, last time I talked to him... actually I tried to get a hold of him, his service was out. You have any ideas? I've got some bodies down at the border patrol, maybe they can talk to some people there. Sounds like a good idea. You had dinner yet? No, I'm starving, I was just about to grab a bite. Where? I'm over the Farmer's Market over northwest parking lot. Turn around. No, turn all the way around. Look over here. Who're you talking to? [Roy chuckles] Your evil twin. Get in the car. [bangs] I'd like to advise you to double check your incoming mail. Tighten your security... until we have this suspect arrested. Mr. March, of course, we will follow your advice... but what makes you think that the storage of pharmaceuticals will be the next target. -Did you receive a tip? -I was given a sign. A sign? You mean, like a sign from God? You can think like that if you want to. I did not get a phone call from Heaven. I did not, but in my work, I researched and my guys gave this newspaper article. And this placed of you is on the list, Coral. and Mr. Bromma's acts of terrorism. Stanley, contact the mail room immediately. Absorb and digest what I've told you, because it's the truth... and call me when you get needed information. Get my car... we need to work on this now. And tell the people in the mail room to look through everything. Yes, sir. No, not even post cards. I'm telling you the mail room is completely shut down. I can see that they're getting paranoid after what happened in Coral. Yeah, Bill sent me a box of chocolate, do you think it'll be okay after they scanned it. -I think chocolates are okay. -Yeah, okay. Yeah, good. -Oh, let me give you this. -Thanks. I see it like this. little girl crying... her mother's in the corner, not paying attention... depression, it's a suicidal moment. And then all of a sudden, those golden letters appear on the bottom of the screen, Polarium . Mother and daughter smile and they hug each other. And then the headline:Polarium, from suicide to "Suealive" . Helen, what do you think? Yes, Mr. Storgeous. You got me a new pen set? I don't know what you're talking about, sir. Right there, that's the new set. [Helen] Maybe someone sent it for your birthday. I've never seen this pen set before, sir. Oh. No, wait. -Well. -No. It's actually beautiful. If you don't like it, I can remove it. No, no. I'm just a little paranoid, that's all. Okay, I understand, sir. Here are the documents. Sure. -Sir. -Yeah, thank you very much. Thank you. Oh, Helen, hang on a sec, I want you to type out my idea. Just wait a minute. [explosion] I knew it. How many casualties? How many casualties. Five dead, a dozen wounded. Trying not to get too worked up, Captain. If you don't arrest this bastard today... you're gonna live on the street for the rest of your life. What did you bring me here for? Why did you bring me to the fucking hospital? What am I doing with these? [bangs] This is all we can dig up in the archives on Elise McClosky. -Thanks, Clayton. -Hmm hmm. -Good job. -Thank you. You want to send Miller here on your way out? Sure. How's March? He almost had a heart attack spending most of his day yelling at the hospital staff. Well, at least it's gonna be quieter around here for a change. What planet are you from? You tracked down the father's address? Yeah, corner of Central and Third, but hasn't been around for weeks. Neighbors said he had a ranch down at Tijuana. Anything else? A couple of disturb reports by McCrosky's neighbors. I guess since his daughter was taken, he's taken it pretty hard. Started off quite nasty and went completely out of control. He started to fire his gun off his balcony in the middle of the night. They put him on anti-depressant. -Happy pills. -Hmm, but there was a kicker. Guess who makes Gleemnocs? -Ralco. -Bingo. But since the surveillance is on this guy, I want him the minute he gets back. Bring him in and find out what he knows. You really think he's our man? It's a little early to tell, but it all adds up. Missing daughter, the Ralco connection, god knows what the drug did to him. And then there's Bromma. You often pay back for the guy who stole your wife, huh? Contact the police in Tijuana, see if he's got anything on him. You think the Mexican police will be willing to cooperate? -It can't hurt to try. -Okay. You heard anything from Somov? No, I called the cell phone, but there's a message on it saying the service's got canceled. Poor guy's having a hard time to say no, the restaurant job is just a part time job. At least he gets caviar and champagne on his lunch break. Isn't there something you can do? We'll call up the Russian mafia and see what they can do. -I was being serious. -Yeah, I know. He needs a break. Well, folks, this is it. Almost America. Hey, let me carry her. No, I don't want you to touch her. Hey, Lena, look. See this? Watch. [Burp] [sigh] [gasp] Pretty good, huh? Baa! Let's go. Okay, we're still in Mexico. For about 25 file yards out is the neutral zone, and outside that, we are in America. We get warmer and warmer. There should be a car waiting for us on the other side of that hill. I think Lena is sick. Come here. How are you doing? She does have a high fever. I told you, you should have left her with me at the ranch. Stop it, I don't want to listen to you. You not listening made her sick. I said enough, alright? Alright. Here we go. Rita, step only on the grass patches, that way they won't see our track. This is the neutral zone. Twenty-five yards, and we're in America. We're almost in America. Here we go, ready? Here we go. Let's go. Okay, take her. Take her. -What's up? -Walk ahead, I have to go back. I have to cover the track you left. Just straight ahead, but only walk on the patches of grass. Okay, give her to me. I think she's getting worse. This is a good rest spot. So where's the car? It's supposed to be right over there near the tree. What happened? Are we late? No. So where is the car? Maybe you told them the wrong place to meet us. No. Something might've happened to Max. So what do we do now? Walk? Twenty miles in the desert? Your daughter will never make it. Okay, then I'll walk her myself, and you call yourself a coyote? What are you charging for? If you go alone, you'll definitely got caught. How will they stop me, we've already crosses the border. You don't think they'll ask for documents, a women and child walking on foot on the border. So what do you suggest? I suggest we stick to the plan, we wait for Max. What if he doesn't show up. What if he got caught? Well, then we'll have to go back to the ranch. Oh no, no. I'm not going back there. I would rather stay here. Alright, if we get caught, I'll say Lena is my child, I'm an American citizen... at least we'll have a chance. Great plan. I go to jail, and Lena stays with you, yeah? Okay, we'll stick with your plan. You go to jail, Lena will stay with complete strangers... at least you know me, lady. I'd prefer her to stay with strangers than be brought up with a psycho like you. I'm tired arguing with you. Lena, you want some water? Yes. [blows] Here we go. [blows] -Hi. -Hi. Where can I find gasoline? No gasoline. -Over there? -Yeah. Okay, thank you. -It's hot. -Yeah, okay. Something must have happened to Max? He would've been here by now. We gotta go back. I'm not going anywhere, they will understand if I explain what happened. You don't get it, do you? You are a criminal, you cross the border illegally. You know what that spells? Jail. We gotta go, the boarder petrol will be around in about 15 minutes. I'm not going anywhere. [revving] No, run! Come on, hand me the kid. Stay where you are. Take her, take her. [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [police car sirens] Your sweet life is over, coyote! Do you hear me? Over. When we find him... [bangs] I'm going to put her to bed. Why don't you guys sleep in my bed tonight? I'll be in the barn if you need me. -Thank you. -You're welcome. [door creaks] [coughs] Larry, I want to talk to you. How's she doing? Is she asleep? Yeah, yes, she is. What's up? I feel awful. I think I made a horrible mistake, I did not know it turned out like that. I don't want to go to America anymore, I just want to go back home. Wow, I thought you said it wasn't safe. Yeah, I know. I know, but I've got a family back over there. I shouldn't have come here, I didn't even come close to find my husband. I thought I could make it by my own, start fresh in America, but... all of that is about fate. You can't change fate. I'm so tired of all of that. I guess I just want you to take us back to the airport. Certainly, let me call you a limo. Honey, it's the middle of the night. It's crazy to run away, but I want to go home, please. You know, I hate this shit. What? Well, the way some women just act all whim when things don't turn out just the way they want. You guys blame it on fate. What are you talking about? I'm talking about the fact that you don't take responsibility when things turn out bad. This isn't fate. This is bullshit. If this is fate, why involve your kid, why chase after your husband? Your kid's got nothing to do with that, your kid's sick, she's running a fever... you want to take her to an airport. What's wrong with you? You have a child, don't you? I had a child, Liz. I lost her, when she was three years old. My wife's fate, Bromma, she put that child through hell. He made her smoke, fed her beer, and those are the sweet tender moments. I'm so sorry. My wife found a boyfriend, but she lost our child. When I think my daughter's fate, I want to take those people responsible... and blow their brains out. I know they think they'll never see me again, but believe me, they're wrong. They are so wrong. Don't. I just want to check on Lena. No, it's not good, listen. -I didn't want to... -Shut up. You're not going anywhere. Give me your hand. Larry, I swear. I won't say to anybody. Please don't touch her. Please don't touch her. What's wrong with you? I'm not gonna hurt Lena. Just gonna go get some medicine. Now, just in case. You can trust me. Even if I can't trust you. [Somov talking] I'm pretty sure this is coyote. I recognize his truck. -For you? How old? -She's six. Let her drink in the morning and then in the evening. Give her this one, and let her chew all day long, this one. Okay. How old is your daughter? [Larry] Six. How can I tell you? I was a detective in Moscow. Never a dull moment. Something was happening all the time. [Somov] Even the day before coming to the States. I ended up catching one of Russia's most wanted criminals. [police car sirens] He shot me on the shoulder. But I just kept chasing him all the way to the roof. There we were, both dangling from the roof... with no idea who would be the first to take the fall. [man screaming] Yeah, I sure had some interesting times. My son was always worried. [speaking Russian] You know, since I was a kid, I fantasized about coming to America. Always thought I would be a big success. And look, what happened here. I ended up working in a Russian restaurant. Hello, little princess. Time to take your medicine. Mama? Mom is asleep? Here, this'll make you feel better. Here you go. Do you like her? This is Rainbow Bright, she has magical powers. See, watch. Give me a kiss. Kiss you. Watch this. Give me a kiss. I gave her some medicine. I think it'll help. Let's go, she's asking for you. [Rita groans] Sorry. It's gonna hurt. [Rita screams] Sorry, babe, here we go. You think that just because your brother works at customs... we're not gonna touch you... you better think again. It's time for you to pay. Trust me, you don't want to know what happens to you if you don't. [speaking Spanish] I have no money, business is down. Oh, business is down, you say? What about your other business? Ah? I don't know what you are talking about? [laughing] [beating and screaming] What do you think? I'm stupid? You're the [illegible], because I know everything about your other business with coyote. I tell you this, your friend, he's going to go down. The question is, are you willing to go down with him? Huh? I got a phone call from the LAPD, they too want him. But before I turn him to the damn gringos, I want my piece. I only one, you better tell me. I really don't know what you are talking about. Okay, okay, okay. You know Juan, don't you? -Si. -Okay. He told me that you work for a gringo coyote. And you know where he lives. He is a liar. He may be a liar, but he's not stupid. Are you? I'm counting to three. Okay, okay, okay! I'll tell you where he lives, I better take you there. [screams] You're very smart after all, you know, come on. Well, the smart thing to do is leave Lena here with me. When this thing blows over, I'll let you guys back together. -What're you talking about? -I've got a house, you don't. I've got the money, you don't. Your life is in danger, mine isn't. You don't get it, you're a complete stranger to her. She used to me. Right? She's my daughter and I'm not going to give her up, you understand? I understand. [Lena talking] What did she say? She says that she wants to feed the doll. Well, the doll is probably hungry. How about Larry makes her something to eat, huh? Come on, mom. I'll make us dinner. Come on. [Larry] For you. -Thank you. -You're welcome. What are you talking about? She doesn't speak any English, and I was explaining to her why we should stay with you. You know what, doesn't sound like you were explaining what she's saying. You don't speak any Russian, why do you know? I don't have to speak Russian, I just have to look at her face. Kids don't lie. Are you looking for me? Drop the gun if you don't want to lose your daughter. Drop the gun. [gun shoots] What are you trying to do? I've got the keys. -Get out of the car. -No! Look, it doesn't have to end like this. I meant what I said, I'm over to help you. Open the door. I don't want your help. I just want to go home. But you can't. I've got the gun. And if you don't open the door, I'm gonna start shooting. [gun shoots] Please, don't shoot, the child is there. This man is not a killer. I'm Russian policeman. Great, first I got the LAPD give me orders, and now I gotta listen to a damn Russian police. What's going on today? Why is everyone trying to boss me around? -What happened to you? -Don't worry about me. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay, don't be unhappy. Rita, come here. [Larry] I have lots of money. Don't talk. Don't talk. Shh. I'm saving it for my daughter, but... In the barn, go through the door two steps, take a left, two more steps... on the floor bottom, a lot of money. I need... I need help. [March] Somov. Yeah? Remember, we met in the park. I remember you. But how do you know my name? From Sommers and Macmillan. I'm their boss. Oh, so you're March. -Yes. -I heard a lot about you. And I'm a complete nut-job. I heard a lot of good things. Yeah, did they tell you we found Bromma? Bromma? They guy who was blowing up the pharmaceutical companies? No, they didn't have a chance. So who found him. -The nut-job. -Really? Moi. How? The guy's name is Miguel Sanchez. He's a brilliant biochemist, and he created what he thought was a breakthrough drug. But it got rejected by all the major companies. And I had a feeling. I saw Sanchez was rejected by both. How about Bromma? You mean Bromma. It turns out Miguel Sanchez has a twisted sense of humor... Bromma means joke in Spanish. So Summers was just wasting his time looking for Bromma? It was one of our leads. This one turned out to be a dead end. It happens. By the way, this is for you. The Certificate of Honor. I want to give it to you myself. Why are you doing this? Because they told me all about the Russian roulette. And I've never been invited. [both laughing] Pal, consider it as an invitation. And consider it as an acceptance. It's good to see you. You feeling better? -Yeah. -OK, I'll check with you later. Congratulations. Andrea, March told us he wants to use you more often. I think he likes you. -Really? -How is your shoulder? It's okay. Strange thing, I keep having... first, this was dislocated, now it gets shot. I'm ready to take a new model. I'll introduce you to a doctor right now. You'll like him. He's Russian. March told me that he found the bomber. Yeah, Bromma the joker. It seems to me that the joke is on Larry, they put him in jail for nothing. What do you mean nothing? He was running people across the border. He held you all the gun point. What about Rita and Lena? They went back to Russia. Hi, Somov, how are you doing? I just talked to the doctor, he said you'll be alright. How's Marvo, he's doing great, just like being married again. I sleep on my side of the bed, growls when I go to grab a beer, nags when I come home late. -What are those for? -For a toast. I know it's against hospital regulations, but... -We're officially off duty. -Yes. What kind of toast? It's a small one, but you're gonna like it. -Really? -Yes, believe me. If I get any on bed, you'll such on the sheets. Alright, fellow, to your granddaughter. What? Yeah, your son called. His wife has a little girl, 2.2 kilos. [Roy] What's the matter, Somov? Isn't 2.2 kilos good? It's perfect, Roy. It's absolutely perfect. [laughs] Mazel tov! Cheer! [in Russia] Sounds like Russian. That a boy. Take some pain away. Not bad. It's fun with the pills too. This is nice, thank you. -You've got a minute? -Sure. Okay, go ahead. He's funny, isn't he? I see in visions and in pictures and I saw you in the police. I've never been there, sir. Well, I saw you, I saw how you train. I saw you get a diploma. I saw you get your badge, and I saw you get your gun. -Really? -Really. Well, I think it's a little too late for me. Too late for what? To learn? When does this training start? It just started. Welcome to where you belong. Go get your locker.
