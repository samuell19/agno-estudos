Three astronauts, Tom Krieg, Oscar Wilde and Justin Lancelot, were in despair. If they were not back on Earth in 56 seconds, they would be dead. "We must get back to the Earth's gravity field," Tom shouted as he steered the space shuttle into Earth's orbit. 50 seconds... The space shuttles was rushing towards Earth. 40 seconds... "If we do not reach Earth on time, we'll explode!" Oscar said hoarsely. 30 seconds... Justin pressed down the propulsion lever. 25 seconds... The space shuttle was heading for the Caribbean Sea. 24 seconds... Suddenly the rocket turned. Oh no - sighed Justin. 20 seconds... "I'm afraid we’ll have to make a water landing", murmured Oscar. He was quite hoarse. 10 seconds... 9... 8... 76... Tom pressed the button for the braking rocket, the space shuttle braked abruptly, almost everything flew forward. Then the tail plane was sinking. 4 seconds. The space shuttle fell in a horizontal position towards the Caribbean. ...3...2...1 The space shuttle landed - SPLASH. Zero. The elementary school Berg Fidel in Munster accepts all children in its city district. No child is transferred to a special-needs school during the 4 school years. These are planes. You rightly said, they're solid figures. Now I show you, my hand. So, what's the difference between a solid and a shape, which I can draw on the board? That one has just 4 corners at a time. You mean solids always have more corners? I know it! Octagon. - Yes. It doesn't really look like an octagon. An octagon is... You can take a solid in your hand, you can only draw a shape. A solid you can put in your hand. Who knows another shape? We have a square, a rectangle. What else can I draw? Circle! - Correct. I know you knew it, Nicki. I used to be into dinosaurs. But now I am more interested in astronomy. And I'd like to be an astronomer. Why? I already have so many questions, which are not easy to answer. For example: Where does the universe end? There is so much to calculate and you can't just simply figure it out, because I can't imagine that it always goes on and on. Hey, it just rips. You should use the part you already cut out. That one, right? - Yes. Look. You cut out a tree. You use that bit, there. I out that one off. Shit. Yes, gimme another one. One day my telephone rings I pick it up, and first you don't say a thing. Afterwards, this sentence comes from you: "Forget me, you are no longer my darling". I can't forget. With fire I have written in my heart that I love you more than anything. A million liters of water cannot extinguish it. Was our love only a lie? What is your greatest dream? To be a top model. To be able to walk really well. I cannot walk as well as the other girls yet. My name is Lucas, I am 7 years old and I'm in the Dolphin class. What do you like about school? Break and sports. Do you know, what you want to be? - Yes, I know. Racing car driver. Because racing cars are really fast. And you drive those low cars. That's why. 4... 7... 8. Seven. - You're beautiful. Stupid cow. - I had that one before. You're a stupid cow! You're a stupid cow! We have to go to the bench circle. - Yes, right. Weekly class council meeting Enrico hit me. From Davina. Checked off and apologized. During the break Anita kicked me and said nasty words. I did not! Honest? Why did you kick her? - I didn't! Honest! You kicked me during break. Anita? - I can't remember. I was back there. I was still at the kiosk. You weren't! Lucas? - I also... saw it as I was riding my scooter during break. Then I saw it. I stopped... and watched for a bit what was going on. Just apologize. Say clearly to Anita what you don't like. She should not kick me again and say nasty words to me. Anita! - What? It's your turn. I won't kick other children any more. Denisa, can we check this off'? Yes. It's the break. Want to swap? No. - Please! - No! Please! David! - No. Wait! Lila what would you like? Apple. In German, not Roma. - OK. Then, apple. I come from Kosovo. There was... how can I say? They destroyed our house and then we came to Germany. There was war. We came with a boat. It was... filled with air...and a motor... Then it broke down. I fell in, with my father. She also fell in. Then the boat driver jumped in and saved them. Another boat came, picked us up and it took a week until we got to Germany. We are both waiting for our residency permit. My father always says to me and my sister 'school, school'. He sleeps like a rock. Are you ill? Are you ill? Ok, go upstairs and lie down in bed. Anyway, if you stay, stop squeaking, or whatever you're doing. No. Then go upstairs. - No. Then stop. There are two possibilities: Either you go up and carry on with what you do, or you stay here and stop. Ok. Are you going to stop it? - Ok. Good. Hello. Good morning, loves. First, preferential work. Finished. - Super. It's not that bad. Besides it won't hurt the cat to have tail surgery. This stuff is for first graders! Connect the numbers which add up to ten. Look. Look here. Now the cat has its tail again. Just look. We sometimes meet in the schoolyard, But I'd rather play with my friends. I am also pretty sure that Jakob is fine on his own. Besides, I think Jakob never really marches around the schoolyard alone. There are always other kids with him. I don't think anything can go wrong, really. Research workshop Finished! 8 times 10, the addition task for it. 10... - Yes, continue. Write it down, Atal. - 10 plus 1! 10... plus... Eight? We want 8 times 10 as an addition problem. Let’s check: 8 times... I see, makes 80! - Yes! Look. We don't really want to write such a long sum. It doesn't fit in our exercise book! Exactly. 8 times 10 is much shorter and it's the same. Then there was this mathematical problem. A horse breathes about 10 times a minute. How often does it breathe in an hour? Lilian? - 600. Correct, you got it right. Now you'll get your work back. Anita, look at your point total, I was really happy... First time I got a B. I have never had B before, it's the first time. Good! Ms. Fleck said it was good. Apple. Locomotive. Crocodile. Cro-co-dile. Cro-co-dile. Three! Peng-gu-in. Three. - You both got three? No, Jakob, you only have two. Look, just apple. Apple. - The others have three. They need to show another card. Chim-ney-swee-per. Four. Chim-ney-swee-per. - Yes, four. You need a tissue, don't you? Wh...at she f...inds. She h...as al...rea...dy a... big... collection. Big collection. She s...ees an... old... Rusty? Bo...ttl...e... op...en...er. The whole word? - Bottle opener. 'Son of a bitch' is the first swearword. Loser. Wanker. Arse. Well, only three swearwords. They are the worst ones I could think of to put in here. Those were the swearwords which were nastiest. Performance tuned cars are cars, which are modified like this one here. There’s something different in front, at the back, on the sides, new rims. Overhauled engine, built in Nitro and such. So, the cars become faster. Mostly youngsters drive those cars. But some adults tune their cars, too. Older people not really, old grandmas and grandpas. They don't drive sports cars. It would look stupid. A grandma or grandpa with such a car. When my father takes my electric Porsche, it means we go outside and play with it a little bit. Anyway, dad doesn't really ever play with us. At least not with me, with Steffen he plays a bit more. This picture here, I painted this in art. The task was, to paint like Penck. Penck was a painter and he painted stick men. So, I painted a hunting scene. A tiger who'd got hit in the back by an arrow. Next to it a man who holds the tail and a bow. A fire where a wild boar is being grilled. And another man. It's a hunting scene. It's set in earlier times. In the cave-painting time. More in the cave-painting time than in the time when people watch Superman on TV. Friendship is something great. If you have a friend you just aren't lonely anymore. I know the feeling of being lonely... Once for example, I was... Walking alone across the schoolyard. But it is sometimes nice when you are alone. You can clean up against a wall and just turn off the world around. Just sink into your own thoughts. And not bother with other stuff for a while. It's like this: The mother and the father see a girl and ask the parents 'May we see your daughter'? They go and look at Vikrije as she's making coffee, asking ‘What would you like?'. And then they look and so on... Then they say 'Ok, we take her'. Then the woman asks how much money? 1000 million Euros something like that. No idea. Then she says yes, ok. Then she's engaged. Then they get to know each other a little. Then the next year they get married. Then they are a couple and well... 'For David, I love you, Daniela'. A heart, then it says "sex". But that is not Daniela's handwriting. It's Doreen. - Yes, it was Doreen! Daniela didn't write that. Give me the letter. It's not Daniela's handwriting. - Right. It's not Daniela's handwriting. - Doreen, it was you! This is how I draw a heart. But that's another sheet. Ha! A suspect! Here's a gap, with mine there's no gap. It's someone who isn't good at drawing hearts. It's Andreas! Then I need to check the letter for spelling errors. David, ask her. I'm sure she wants to with you. Religion is starting in two minutes. Are you ready? Now we caused an accident, Jakob. The sign means wait, attention. Jakob, here's another sign. What's it means? Where may you go? There. Yes, and if you hold it this way? Which direction can you go? Jakob, keep it up straight! What are you doing, Jakob? - No! Erase that. No, Jakob. It's not funny! An 'L' as in 'lollipop'. Yes! But not so long. And now here. What's that? What's the first letter? No, not there. Don't check it off yet. We're not done yet. So, young man, which letter? No, Jakob. What's the first letter? 'F' as in 'fish'? Yes, write that down. 'F' is gone. No, it's here. Like in 'flaski'. Do you have Stickler Syndrome, too? - What's that? No, but I have "stupidity". What do you have? I am handicapped, too. I am stupid and ifs contagious. Hey David, I am handicapped, too. I am contagiously stupid. Hey David, shall I touch you? Then you get it, too. So, now you got it, too. Sometimes I just don't figure out things that fast. But it's not my concentration. It's because I sometimes get distracted and because I can't learn as fast as the others. Because I'm left-handed. I can't learn as fast as the others. Do you need more time? Left-handed people need more time than right-handed guys. Lucas, what makes you strong 7 Really nothing at all. There has to be something... A bit more time to think, as you said? More time? Not really right now. But I could use nimbler fingers. Ok, problems which just keep on repeating, I think are shit. For example, 7 divided by 7, 70 divided by 7, or 7 million divided by 7, it's so simple. Always just a 1 and more and more zeros attached to it. First no 0, then 1, then 2, then 3, then 4, then 5 zeros attached... I really don't like those. Easy tasks. I prefer tougher ones. I hate easy tasks with lots of required writing. I don't think they are necessary. In school how do you deal with mistakes? We learn from the mistakes. I don't know what exactly, but we do learn something from them. We already discussed how to take breaks during preferential work, and how to best finish your break later. Has anyone watched themselves, and taken charge of himself? I'm curious to know. When I was taking the test, I thought, I am not concentrating as I should, but I also didn't want to play, which would take too long, and I wouldn't have enough time. Sol said to myself: I'll just sit down on my chair for a bit, and then I'll continue. Jakob, do you sometimes get tired? Can you repeat what he said? Sometimes when we both take a break simultaneously, and there's sports, then I take him there. Or earlier, when he got tired, I read something to him. They built a tower and it kept collapsing. Then it hit him right on the nose. Is that right? - Yes! March 2, 2009 Driton says perverse things... Pawese! I'll open the class council. I'll read out the topics. Timothy hit us. Maybe we should get Timothy over here? But he often does stuff like that. Maybe the two should attend the Frogs' Class Council? I was there with Caroline, he kicked me in the shin-bone... It won't do any good. First, he hit Leo, then me. After two days he came to me and apologized. I accepted it. Afterwards he had another fight with Leo. I'd say the children who're involved go to the Frogs' Class Council. Michele knows where it is. Anyone have any objections? Good. This topic is over. Daniela boxed me in the back from Doreen, and Lisa. Johanna, Caro. I am walking along and there was a poor snail lying on the ground, it got almost trampled over. I wanted to put it on the grass, she comes up behind, and hits me on the back. I think Doreen did right, and Daniela did not. Doreen just wanted to save the snail, and then Daniela comes up and hits Doreen. It's not ok. I don't think we should discuss it endlessly. Daniela gets a tipping-off, and it's done with. Everyone agree? Good, then the issue is settled. Jakob, are you doing cocoa duty with me? Please get away from there. Now. Get back to play later, now it's cocoa duty. Jakob, how many spoonful’s do you put in? I hate it when you do that. Stop, Jakob. It's disgusting. Don't put it in your mouth, right? - Ok. Really? No! Did he lick it? No. He wanted... What did Sajhantiy just say? Are you supposed to lick that or not? Why do you do it? Cocoa! Cocoa tastes nice, right? When you finished stirring, at the very end, then you may lick it. I clean it, now you stir. For the last time. Keep stirring. Keep stirring. Are you ready? Ask Sajhantiy if you may. Yes, we're done. Ask Sajhantiy if you may. May I lick it? I'll just get something to eat. Lucas, come here first, please! Off you go. Hide from Justus, then Justus will look for you. Victim successfully found. Black humor or super jokes. A man comes with burned ears to the emergency ward. The doctor asks, how did that happen? The man tells him, I was ironing, the telephone rang. I was so in my thoughts that I put the iron to my ear, instead of the phone. But you burned both ears, how did you do the other one? I needed to call the ambulance! Now write the next word. What did you want to write? You wanted to write more. Jakob is a man, you said. Should I write the sentence? Jakob is a man? Jakob is a farmer and a man? Yesterday I did gymnastics. His pronunciation is funny. I did gymnastics yesterday. Jakob is a farmer, a man. You like that. I said something in class council. Well. It's annoying when he messes around there. It's distracting. You just have to concentrate. It's not that easy! He mustn't! Why not dance over there, Jakob. - No. Dad, shoot! No! Me, me, me! Lucas, dad is practicing his goalkeeping. Stay out of the way. Dad's turn. Goal! Here's your report. Take a look! - It's your report. I'll read it to you: dear Lucas, Your work habits have improved compared to the last year. You start work by yourself, and complete your tasks, even if you need time. We see you're keen to get on, which is great. You have difficulty spelling, because you find it hard to memorize new words and rules. In math’s you tackle written addition and subtraction well. It's really decent, a lot of it is positive. Especially on your recent improvement in work habits. You start yourself and work with determination. You've become more ambitious. It's something we hope you'll take into fourth year after the summer. I think I might be bent over my desk in the holidays. Do my revision. - I don't think so. It's not what we'd want, either. It should be a holiday for you. Take some rest from school. Maybe half an hour, when Steffen does Latin revision, we'll practice dictation. Two hours. - Half an hour's enough. Nicki did that first as well. Four B's and nine A's. That's like with the B, you daydreamed and didn't concentrate on work. But you have always reminded yourself, I need to work on that tomorrow or revise at home. Some other schools take kids with hearing disabilities. So, I heard informally. New staff must learn how to cope with the transmitter. It's vital for him. We'll all have to make use of the FFM system. They'd need an introduction from the special needs teacher, on the pitfalls, and the general use. Here at the bottom, it says, David Leonhard is promoted into 4th grade. Now you reached 4th grade, the top. Vacation time! Yesterday... we discussed being handicapped. I said, handicapped people are unfortunate. Because they're impaired. Then I said, I am slightly handicapped, too, not completely, but I don't hear well, nor do I see well. It's Stickler's Syndrome A syndrome makes everything different from the moment of birth. It primarily affects your eyes and ears and often you get twisted thighs. I got it, too, it varies, but it doesn't bother me much. I look forward to going on holiday on Spiekeroog island. We're on a mother/child retreat. It'll be awesome. Due to the "immigration tolerance status" Anita may not leave North Rhine-Westphalia. Everything's dirty. Our boss. I'll take a seat. Give him his SpongeBob. Give him! No Achmed. You're not going to eat more. After summer vacation ls your deportation imminent? Yes, but we were told to ask not to be sent to Kosovo. A note came which said deportation. I swear by the Koran. We are afraid. This morning the police comes and sends them home to Kosovo. Where should we go there? Anita, you all got the letter? Yes. Everyone here did. Everyone in the street? - Yes. Project Week "Peace" Dear Angela Merkel, us Romanies... I don't want to go back. I write Asim has deportation. You have deportation. Asim doesn't. What did you write. Merita? No. MERKEL! We Romanies will stay! Thank you all for coming. For us, for the Romanies. Justice for all! Stop deportation! The right to stay for the Romanies. That is too low for me. No, this one isn't lowered. No, that is kind of a sports car, that is too low for me. I prefer a car which is a bit higher. Oh, I can recommend one. For preferential work I do spelling revision. And? Thin math’s book. Ambro, you should look up these words in the dictionary and then write down the numbers behind them. Page and number. Jakob! Good. T like 'Tuba'. - Cuba. "Calculated". Oh, 'L' came up. We'll have to delete it. Jakob has calculated. Now you say it. Jakob... has... calculated. 9 times 3 equals 27. Nerd! My cousin also became a complete nerd. She hangs up her school schedules. Oh my god, a complete nerd. Alicia's a nerd, too. Which school is she at? Don't know, she wears nerd clothes. Then I take a break. Car. Sajhantiy got it. Someone droves an oar, and crashed into a tree. It was an accident. How terrible! It happened this morning? What do you do when you're sad? I can't learn. - You find it hard. Do you need someone to explain math’s, then, or someone to comfort you? Comfort... Jakob, did you help others sometimes? We'll ask, who knows, whom Jakob has helped out. Last year, we held a class council nearly all the kids cried, because it was too unruly. With no adults there. Jakob consoled everyone. Jakob consoles you really well. It's different from doing well at math’s. When there's trouble, you can turn to Jakob who helps to make you laugh again. Brings the smile back to your face. Dispels your troubles. You do it by yourself. I can't. That's the figures, try. It's 30. That's the difference. That's how fast it works? Really easy. That's that, and that's that. Sign on top. Right, tatootata, where do you hear that? Right, tatootata, where do you hear that? With fire-engine, ambulances and police cars. Why? So that they can pass the red traffic lights. So, others clear the way as fast as possible. It's the same here... Tatootata, spring is coming. I demonstrate. Now you. - But it's different. That's what it sounds like with real fire engines. You're right. I meant the song. Let the water out. The song goes like this. Short, short, short long. Perfect! It sort of repeats itself. You did well! Just like the tune? - Yes, perfect! We'll manage another song. Is this my homework? Yes, two songs. Too much? No, I do so much for school, this is less. I'd like to get good grades. Grades affect your career later. You want to become a car tuner, don't you? No, now I'd like to be something else. A BMX rider or skater. Tony Hawk, for example, earns more than 28,000 Euros per second. Actually, he lives in America so, it's Dollars, but I say Euro. If I did Well in reading, in math’s. If I was good in everything, I can maybe go there. I'll see... If I'm good enough then I want to go there. Where? Hiltrup junior secondary school. I always have strange dreams. That my brother gets kidnapped. Then I have to cry at night. Going out and talking to my friends, My mum always says "no makes me clean or look after my brother. I think it sucks. Please come in. Good morning. Please take a seat. - Thank you. You're in Germany since 1998. Now you get a passport. You've finally made it. The problem is we issue it so, you get a passport from your own country. It's valid for half a year only, then you have to give it up. In this time you have to get a new passport. Sign here. Date. Signature. That's what it looks like. - Thank you. The page with your residency, and the front is the actual passport. I wish you good luck and success. Me, Salomon, Andreas and Justin wondered what to do. Then we had the idea of a poem. They did some of it, but I actually wrote the poem. I'll cover up that l wrote the poem, and let them bathe in the fame. The snow lies deep, the fir tree crooked, it is not too long until Christmas time. The wind is cold, dark the forest, it is not too long until Christmas time. Quickly falls the snow, still is the lake. It is almost here, Christmas is very near. Can you do that? Justin, you can do it! Should I do it instead? You can do it too, Salomon. What do you wish for? A big stuffed toy? Make your wish Christmas is near. That's it. Should we memorize it? No! The first phrase we'll do together. The snow lies deep, the fir tree crooked, The snow lies deep, the fir tree crooked, it's not too long until Christmas time. Anita, we don't have swimming today! You need an adult whom you trust, that's what you said. And you'd like someone there whom you know. Take the list to your choice of schools and check if everything is fine for you to learn well. I'll jot it down on your computer? After the holidays you need to start looking at schools. After the vacation? - Yes. We'll get together to sort out which school is good, and you check out that school. What do you wish for in secondary school? For secondary school l wish friends, good teachers, and good chewing-gum machines. I'd like many friends, nice teachers, class trips, carpeted floors, nice kids, a pretty schoolyard. Teachers with a sense of fun. A girl now. Why carpeted floors? Because... well... Feet shuffling on normal floors, makes it hard to hear with the hearing aid. Because they amplify the sound. You have a hearing aid? He doesn't hear so well. - Oh. I wish for good grades for high school entry, strict teachers, nice friends and lots of sports. Special-needs school open day Looks a bit like a church. - No. It's just an old building. I bring a visitor who wants to see what it's like here. This is our current 4th grade, next year they'll be 5th grade. Is there anyone who's as tall as Anita? No one. We think it makes sense to group together kids the same age who're are close in their physical development. They all fit together and no one sticks out. If I put you, someone who's already pretty tall in with the smaller girls in the current 4th grade, you'd be at least half a head taller than them. So, Anita would belong in Class 6. She'd need to skip a year, from 4th to 6th. How cool! Look, that's what it looks in Emsland. Many windmills, an elevated suspended railway. Let's go on. Here's a canal and a bridge, here's a factory making dyes. It used to be called Glasurit, now ifs BASF. Let's kneel and check this out. What's the fire brigade fetching? A broken bike, look. - Oh yes. Can't I get into 5th grade? Why must I go to 6th? Because you're so tall already. Let's discuss it with mum and dad on Parents’ Day, what's better for you. I'd like Berg Fidel Elementary to go up to 10th grade. That I'd get through 5,6,7,8,9,10th class. The longer you stay, the better. I think. Why? Because I don't want to have to change. It's better, from 1st to 10th in one go. 'To devour' is also a verb. 'To quack' is a verb. Toad is a noun. How come you read so well? Grandma had a problem with her heart, and I blamed myself. So, l tried to do well, learning. You did great. It was well worth the effort. But you aren't to blame. What gave you that idea? No idea. I just... felt it was my fault. No idea why. Who was that? A builder? - Yes, like me! I'm a builder, right? So, you're a builder, too? - Yes. What are you building? Cars? - Yes. What else? Are you mowing the lawn? - Yes. Look, your report, just like the others. Should I read it to you? - Yes. Dear Jakob. You write sentences in your talker. - Yes. Or you copy something you read to your exercise book. We can read your writing very well. You write in large print. Right? - Yes. During creative writing you write long stories in special script, and you draw pictures. There are some words we can read. Yes. - That's good. And you did beautiful water colors. For example... do you remember? Snowman. With teeth. Cat. A fat one. - A fat cat. Jakob is staying at Berg Fidel for another year. He's then scheduled to go on to a school for the mentally handicapped. Show yours, Lucas. D for spelling. I got D for reading. What does 's. u.' stand for? What's thingy's report like? D in general studies. Ah, because you're not good at writing, huh? Yes, I have a read/spell disability. 'D'? S.U. means "see below"! - I know. I think I'd do fine without going to uni. Recently, at Vennemann's, a cafe where you can watch soccer on TV, I met a girl who wants to go into the same job as I. She wants to be a farmer. Perhaps you can join forces. Yes, I had the same idea, and so did she! After the vacation Lucas changed to a comprehensive secondary school. Here I was on notified absence. You missed ten lessons? - Yes. No errors? - Yes. Speak German. Here I attended every day. That I'm picking up well, help other children. That I behave well with other kids, and I learned a lot. I have to return it Monday, signed. That's my uncle and my aunt. When was this? Today? No, it was in the papers yesterday. They are so sad. Back in Kosovo there's war, and here not. Here I live better. I don't want to die. That's really what it looks like. A bit like my grandmother. My biggest, biggest wish is, to be thin. I swear. And getting papers, a driver's license, a job and staying healthy. Anita had to transfer to a special-needs school for the learning disabled, because there was no integrative secondary school where she lives. Comprehensives are the best schools I know of, because everyone studies together. You don't think you're doing worse than others. If a schoolmate did better, he's transferred to high-school, instead of staying at the same comprehensive, and the other one goes to junior high. It's really stupid, because it makes you even more aware of doing badly. At school you ought not to rub it in further where your weaknesses are, but rather make you recognize your strengths. Recognize them. I have physical disabilities, but I'm good at other things. When I take off my glasses, I no longer see well. I've got minus 15 diopters in my left eye, minus 3 in my right. But I'm not sure. We haven't tested it for a while. For me the right eye's gone anyway, lost. I see with the left and that’s it. If I'd put an eye patch on, It wouldn't bother me. This is a piece I composed myself. It's in E-minor. I wrote it thinking about a sea trip. Not actually like writing a poem, it's composed. When I play it, I imagine a research ship gliding through the waves and uncharted waters researching the bottom of the ocean. Right, set sails! Listen to the latest version of the "Sea Trip"? Get a chair. It's really beautiful. You played very nicely. David was rejected by two secondary highs. He now studies for university entry at a Montessori school. The elementary school Berg Fidel envisages expansion to 13th grade. No need then to discharge and "segregate" kids at 4th. 500,000 children in Germany are labeled as "learning disabled". 85% of them attend special-needs schools. I'm hot like a penguin in a sauna!
