RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM You're doing great, Maggie, we're almost all done. How are you gonna fit a whole festival in your front yard? Well, hopefully one day it'll be big enough to spread across town and into my candy shop. But for now, this is what we call a trial run. What's a trial run? Well, sometimes when you wanna try something big, you have to start small. You know what else is small? Did I say you could have one before lunch? You didn't say I couldn't? Where's your sister? Jody. Aunt Dee, look what I found. Cool, what is it? It's a music box, my parents gave it to me. You wanna hear it? - Yeah. - Yeah. Listen, girls, this is my favorite. Come on, guys, let's get the blueberry pie. I'm sorry, I'm late, there's endless calls this morning. So she here yet? Not yet. So tell me again, why are we meeting her here? Like I told you I got some Intel and this is her favorite bistro in Minneapolis and she's all about local business, right? So what better place to close the deal than her favorite local restaurant? That is good thinking. And it's a beautiful day. Here comes Ella. This is it. Don't look so excited. Why not? I spent three months putting this deal together. Investment brokers are supposed to have a good poker face. Where exactly in the investor manual does it say that? - Hi, hi Ella. - Hi. I'm so sorry I'm late. My sister just went into labor, I'm gonna be an aunt. Congratulations. Thank you. I hope I haven't kept you waiting long. Not at all, family comes first, right? Right. Should we start? Yes. So you know how thrilled I am to be expanding Ella's Pumpkin Patch from small town store to big time franchise. And our investors are chomping at the bit to bring Ella's two-bite pumpkin pies to the world if you'll pardon the terrible pun. It is gonna be quite a ride. Yeah. Inventory is my job, Dex plus it gives me a chance to snack while I work. Kidding. We both know you're not. Doesn't the farm keep you busy enough? You're doing a charade to distract yourself, aren't you? I'm doing extra work because the festival starts tomorrow. So it has nothing to do with Heather? What? What are you talking...? No, Heather and I didn't even date long enough for me to need a distraction. Dex, and I say this as your friend, you can be a closed book. What's that mean? It means you're as bottled up as that maple syrup from your farm. Which makes me super sweet on the inside. Oh, you got jokes today? Yeah, I do. Seriously though, you doing all right? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. And you know what? Inventory is your job. And don't eat them. We know what a local successor pies are and your pumpkin pudding. We have franchise expansion, there's also product expansion. Pumpkin coffee, pumpkin candles. - Cereal, cider. - Popcorn, pretzels, even pumpkin spice puppy treats. You've really thought of everything. But... But? But this company, it's been in my family since the early 1930s when my great grandmother, Ella, started it in her tiny kitchen and more or less sustained that way until, well, until now. Look, I know exactly what you mean. My Aunt Dee raised both my sister and I since we were kids and I practically grew up in her candy store back in Vermont. So you'll understand, then, when I think of adding more locations and large scale equipment. Well, it just doesn't quite feel like our family business. What's happening? I can't believe that she just backed out on the day that we're supposed to close. That's three months work. What am I supposed to tell Stuart and Nora? Look on the bright side. What bright side? The Cobb salad was excellent. Okay, that's funny. Okay, we have to save this deal. I will talk to Ella, I'm sure she just needs more time. This is a lot of change to process. Okay, you're doing that Maggie thing again? What Maggie thing? That just have faith that everything will be okay, thing. We're doing the making me feel guilty ex-boyfriend thing. Okay, you got me there. With some time and a little nudge, I think I can get her there. Well, that's easy for you to say, you leave in the morning. Only for a couple of days. Okay, but I don't know much longer I can hold off the investors. I will figure it out as soon as I get back. Have a maple bite. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Hello. Maggie. I'm so glad you're back. Six months after the funeral as Aunt Dee instructed. Part of her no tears policy. That's right, smiles, memories - and laughter. - And laughter. There you go, room for one more? Eddie, my favorite brother-in-law. Still your only brother-in-law, I hope. The store looks great, you guys. Did you tell her? Don't worry, I'll tell her. Jody is taking over Aunt Dee's position as festival director. What? That's so exciting. You are the perfect person for that. - Really, you think? - Of course. I don't know, I'm just a little nervous. You can totally do it. You can probably do it. It's not easy filling Aunt Dee's shoes. Well, she doesn't want you to be her, she wants you to be you and you will be great. Thanks sis. And plus, I'll have a trusty partner in crime this year. Who's that? You remember Dex? Actually, no, I don't remember Dex. I remember Aunt Dee talking about him, I know he meant a lot to her. I also remember him not coming to the funeral. Right. Well, I know he would have been there if he could have been he's got a lot going on. Okay, you are all stocked up. This is my favorite fringe benefit on this farm. Hopefully have enough pancakes to last you till Christmas. They're just missing one thing. Come on, Dad, it doesn't my name on it, tastes exactly the same without it. You work so hard bottling these, take some credit. Amy next door has been begging me if she can buy some off of you. Amy can have some on the house, it's just a side project. Maybe it could be more than a side project if you'd stop trying to find more things to do around here. Speaking of which, the combine the cornfield blew a gasket. I replaced it this afternoon. Who needs a to-do list, when you leave me with nothing to do? Hey, are you all right? Why does everyone keep asking me that? Okay, well come by for dinner tonight. You've been doing so much running around lately. Dad, I gotta go to the courtyard and put the lights for the festival. Come on, give me a chance to beat you at dominoes. All right, I'll see you this evening. So how was work? You were so excited about that pumpkin pie place deal. Work is great. Yeah, that's to look forward to. Hey, are we still doing the candy making contest for the festival? Are you serious? I'm a judge this year. What? That's so fun. I just feel terrible, I've missed it for the last couple of years. I've just been so... Actually I have to take this, I'm sorry, I'll be right back. - No problem. - No problem. Hi it's Jonathan, leave a message. Of course. Jonathan, it's Maggie. Sorry, it's this guy that is really loud and annoying. I'm gonna have to call you back. Need any help? I'm good. - It's a nice bike. - Thanks. - Is that a '66 Superhawk? - Yeah. Don't see many of those anymore. I know. Sounds like a bad spark plug. It's not the plug. It's just I know a little about motorcycles. Finicky fuel filter. I was gonna say that second. Yep, glad you got it fixed. Well, thanks for your help. You bet, bye. You put out her motorcycle jacket and helmet? That is so perfect. Look at all her reading glasses. She was so adamant about spares. We found spares in every room of the house. And in the candy shop. I would find them in the kitchen, next to the register and shelves. And spare pens everywhere. All your tomorrows depend on today. That's a good one. Is it just me or are these maple bites getting better? These are great. I have that exact photo on my apartment. Hi, everyone, welcome to Aunt Dee's will reading. We're just waiting on one more attendee. But we all know how punctual Aunt Dee was, so I'd like to start. Aunt Dee left as a video version of her will that she wanted us to play today, six months after her passing. Hello, my dears. How lovely to see you here today. I can already tell that a few of you haven't adhered to my no tears policy. Jody, I'm looking at you. Jody, stop blubbering, a smile is a curve that can set things straight, use it. Anyway, just get on with it, there's nothing more boring than a will reading. Who's that guy? - That's Dex. - That's Dex? To my friend Ron, I've only known you for a couple of years since you moved out here from the Midwest. But in some ways, I feel like I've known you and your son for a lifetime. And so I leave you my trusted motorcycle. I know you'll give it a fine and loving home. You bet Dee. Don't talk to the TV, Ron, that's weird. My nieces Maggie and Jody, you've been like daughters to me. I leave to you my home, filled with the sweetest memories, and spares of just about everything else. To my dear Jody, you'll be delighted to know that your antique store is fully paid off. You and Eddie are now its official owners. My life's work has been my candy shop, I'm so proud of that old place. My wish is for it to evolve along a path of positive growth. There are two people who I trust with the responsibility of its ownership. So I leave 50% of my candy shop to my niece, Maggie and the other 50%, hopefully he's arrived by now, I leave to Dex Walters. Thank you all for coming, I love you all. This is the last one. So many boxes. You're telling me. I've been looking through her old photos trying to find that picture of us from the very first festival. I remember just that one picture being taken on the day. Oh you have to find that pic. Hopefully it turns up, before you leave. Hey are you coming to the festival kick off? Of course. Well Dex is about to beat us there. Right, cool motorcycle guy. You know you two do seem very buddy buddy. Yeah, ever since he and his dad moved into the maple farm, a couple years ago, he's been like a son to her and so a friend to us. What? He's fun and he's sweet. Annoying, a tad abrasive. I'm just surprised you too hadn't met before. Maybe I just wasn't in town long enough. No, he keeps pretty busy too. I just don't understand why she would leave me half her business with him. You know? What am I supposed to do with that? I don't know, she doesn't do anything by accident. It's true. Her music box. There's gotta be a key in here. I wish I could have spent more time at home over these last few years. I just feel like I missed out on so much. Hey, Aunt Dee always knew you were busy. Busy is no excuse. I just miss her. Yeah, me too. Now, come on. Yeah. Maggie, open each envelope on the corresponding day of the festival. It is not too late for us to spend the festival together. Love, Aunt Dee. Maggie. Hey, Zach. Yeah, we haven't been able to go through Dee's office yet. I get it. - How are you? - I'm good. How long you are you in town for? Just a couple days. Well, we're happy to have you. I was about to take these gift bags out to the courtyard. Happy to help. You're a guest here, please. I got it, I got it, I used to hand these out back in the good old days. The good old days? It's just a little heavier than they used to be. There's a full bottles of maple syrup in there. - Syrup? - Yeah. You know what? Actually... Why are you following me? I want you to be careful with it. - I got it. - You know what? Let me have it, I can have it. I got it, really. You know, I'd like to handle stuff like that and you can enjoy the perks of co-ownership from a distance. I really prefer to be hands on. Hi, guys take one. You don't even know the business like I do, that's why I wanna buy you out. You want what? Smile for a kick-off photo. You don't live here. So I figured you'd wanna buy out. You don't... We don't have the best history with assumptions, buddy. And if you wanna know my thoughts, I think that Aunt Dee would want us to take her brand nationwide, which just so happens to be my expertise. This is a local brand, this was built here. Hello, welcome to the 30th annual Sweet Autumn Fest with fall treats and activities all week long. Please welcome this year's co-host, Dex. Thanks, Jody. Hey, everyone, I will be keeping Aunt Dee's spirit alive this year with fall fling and the candy making contest coming up this Saturday. So start thinking of your new candy flavors now because who knows? Yours might be on the menu. And while I'm up here, I'd like to introduce you to Aunt Dee's niece. And co-owner. And new co-owner, Maggie Murphy. Thank Dex. Thank you guys, it's so good to see your faces and it's so nice to be home. We have got a lot of big things planned for Aunt Dee's and I cannot wait to explore expanding her legacy together. Aunt Dee's is fine just the way it is, - doesn't need any changes. - Okay. 50%? Well, everyone loves her Maple bites. That's my point. She always talked about evolving and expanding her legacy. Well, that's what I do. We could have a bunch of Aunt Dee's. Who owns the other 50%? Well, that's the conundrum. Convincing this guy to go bigger is gonna be tough, he wanted me to sell. You do love a challenge. Hey, you're not giving up on Ella, are you? I will bring you a deal one way or another, okay? Don't lose faith. I will get on this guy's good side, I think I know his type. Faith is where you shine, you know that I live in reality. It's good to hear you laugh, how you been? I'm good, it's nice to be home. Yeah, I bet. Let's get this done. Okay, bye. Slow down like molasses, or in this case like maple syrup. Rediscover the sweet and slow art of maple sugaring. Now remember, spring is tapping season so we'll ensure that you guys are all seasoned syrup making experts by then. Sap doesn't flow in the fall. You might get a bead or two, but it only comes in the spring. So you wanna make sure that you don't waste a drop. He's right. Thank you. So a tree can produce up to a gallon of sap in the springtime. Can anybody tell me how many gallons of sap it takes to produce one gallon of syrup? Anybody? Yes? - 40. - 40, that's right. This is a spile or a tap. You're gonna want to put the tap in the hole. Aren't you heading back to Minneapolis tonight? I decided to stay. Yeah, spend a week at the festival with you and Aunt Dee, in spirit. Plus I have some work to do. - Well, that's great, - Yeah. So guys I have pre-drilled a bunch of holes in the maple trees back there. Why don't you tap in your spout, attach you bucket and then I'll come around and check on you in a bit. Hey Dex, turns out Maggie's staying the whole week. Isn't that great? That's... I can't think of anything greater. So city girl, you ever tap a tree? Well sap usually flows best on the side of the tree with the most sun exposure, which would be the south side. But you drilled into the north side. Well, it's a demonstration, right? Sap doesn't flow in the fall. I just, that's what I just said, in my presentation. Right. Yeah. Thanks. - You having a little trouble? - Nope, good, real good. It might be the spark plug. And then you wanna take your bucket, hang around the hook, okay? Can I talk to you for just a second? I'm so sorry. I think we may have gotten off on the wrong foot. I'd say wrong feet. Clearly you meant a lot to my Aunt Dee. I did. Well, and since I'm gonna be staying the week, I thought that maybe you and I could spend some time together. You could get to know your new partner and maybe we could even come up with some new candy flavors together or separately. You could hear some of my ideas, nothing permanent. Yeah, yeah, we can do that. Great. Great. Are you distracted? I'm actually winning tonight. What's on your mind? Maggie Murphy. Well, she seems sweet. If by sweet, you mean presumptuous. I've never seen her step foot in the shop. And all of a sudden she thinks she knows what Dee would want. Well, she is her niece, practically her daughter. Have you tried talking to her about how you see things moving forward? I don't see the point. Look, you've got a lot to offer, you should try sharing your thoughts with her. And look at it this way, now that Maggie's back, maybe you won't have to work as much. I mean between the farm the candy shop, you've barely had a day off all year. Might even find some time for that plan you've been putting off. It's your move. It's your move. Dex, keep this close to your heart as a symbol of what we've started together. It's up to you to unlock the future. Hey make sure you're not too loud. I don't wanna wake her up. Yes, that's a great idea. Morning. You scared me. What are you guys doing here? We wanted to surprise you with a we're-so-happy- you're-staying-all-week breakfast. But it is 7:30 in the morning, what time did you get up? 6:00, I slept in. What are you doing with that broom? I hadn't really thought it through. Thank you. You're gonna make me want to stay all year. It's all part of my master plan. We actually wanted to catch up a little. So how are things working out with Jonathan, you know, since you guys dated and all? What? I never heard the breakup story. There's not much of a story to tell. We just realized we were too similar but as mature adults and business partners, we are friendly and cooperative, well, mostly. Mostly? Go on. So you get to ask for all the gossip? It's nothing, just some stress trying to figure out how to move forward with this investment proposal, anyway. You know, Dex is single. What? It sounded like you wanted to change the subject, so I changed the subject. Come on, we gotta go open the shop, it's day two of Sweet Autumn Fest. No, stay. Or you know what? I won't be mad if you wanna sneak in later and make me dinner. - Bye Maggie. - See you later. Working at the shop with you brought me such joy. Relieve those days with me and don't forget to be a team player. Good morning, partner. Good morning. Look what I found in the back, it's my name tag from high school, still fits. It's a name tag. It's a joke. That's a good one. So what does this mean? Well, it means that I am going to be working here, all week, with you. That's great. And I thought that maybe you and Zach could help me out, fill in the gaps, work together, true partnership, as Aunt Dee would have wanted. You seem really confident about what Aunt Dee would want. You seem pretty confident about what Aunt Dee would want. I'm just gonna grab these two jars, that I definitely don't need. Hey Zach, wouldn't it be cool to have a new Aunt Dee's location? That would be cool. Of course, we'd have to look at logistics and... Isn't it also cool, Zach, that Aunt Dee's is the town's little secret. - That's also true. - Right, yeah. But also, isn't it true that Aunt Dee always loved when anyone, anywhere enjoyed one of her treats. I have to distribute these outside to the vendors, so I'm gonna do that. Let me help you. No, it's good, I got it, I really... So you two good? - Stupendous. - Fantastic. Look, I'm gonna be here all week. Why don't we just try and embrace this work together? After you. - No okay. - Yeah. Aunt Dee always loved keeping this festival and candy shop so close to her house. She spent a lot of time out here in her last year. She would sometimes do her candy making out here as well, said she was outgrowing your kitchen. Well, you're in luck because I can help with that. There you go. Thank you. You know, she partnered up with our farm, started adding more flavors. Like apple, blackberries, she even did a sweet candy corn. And that is my point, new ideas, think bigger. She also kept the classics, caramel, chocolate, maple. Yeah, maple bites, the original candy. She started using my maple syrup in her candies. Really? Yeah, after my first harvest, she was my biggest fan. I started helping her out at her shop on my free time and it really started to feel like home. And it's such a beautiful day, I think I might take the afternoon off. See ya. Taking off? Yeah, for the afternoon. He never takes time off. Bye. Thank you. And we are closed. What a feeling it is to work here again. What are you doing over here? Working on our website, it's kind of my thing around here. That looks really good. Thanks. I studied website design, it's what I wanna do. You're really talented. Thanks. Can I ask you something? What is Dex's deal anyway? His deal? Yeah, you know the, I'm a closed book, you can't read me or know anything about me thing? Yeah, that. He wasn't always like that. He's just had a rough go of it last little while. And that break up with Heather, I mean... Who's Heather? He didn't mention it? No, he didn't mention it because he doesn't mention anything. Neither did I. All right, what time is it? Yep, that's it. Okay, clocking out, see you tomorrow. Zach, Zach, who's Heather? Nobody. Frustration comes with every worthwhile endeavor. Keep pushing through and when you need inspiration, you know where to go. Inspiration can only find you if you're out looking because inspiration is looking too. Hi, welcome to the Inspiration Cafe. It's just for myself. Yeah, for sure you can follow me. Here you go and I'll be right back for your drink order. All right, thank you. Dex. - Hey. - Hey. What are you doing here? Just taking a break. Did you just get here? No, no, I've been here, I just had a big meal, just taking off. I'm so sorry, sir. I know we just sat you but actually didn't realize this table was already booked. It's all good, he's with me. Can I get you guys started with some drinks? Yes, I will have the Ella Fitzgerald, please. Okay. Let's do a beer, please. No, you have to try one of these fun drinks. No, no, no. Let's see, Louie Armstrong triple sec with maple bitters, perfect, bitters. Haha, good one. He'll have a Louis Armstrong. Okay, I will be right back with your drinks. Whether we like it or not, we have got to figure out how to work together because we are responsible for Aunt Dee's legacy. Look, Dee left us both her shop. And to be honest, I didn't expect it. But clearly, she trusted me and I'd like to keep things the way they are. And she trusted me as well and I think we should grow things. Here you go. - Thank you. - Thank you. I'd like to tell you a little bit about what I do. I bring investors to small businesses, small businesses that are passionate about what they do. I am passionate about what I do. And Dee always inspired me to grow, to follow my passion, to try and bring joy everywhere I go. And I think you and I can bring joy to people all over the country, maybe even the world. You and I both know how wonderful those candies are. Why not share them with as many people as possible. What do you say? Do you fish? It's a beautiful spot, but fishing isn't the real deal here, is it? Might also be about getting to know the real Maggie. Why don't we start with the real Dex because you are not giving me anything. You're getting to know me. You are getting to know me, I am not getting to know you. Okay, let's just talk about someone else. That's what I mean. What do you wanna know? All right, well, for starters, tell me about what Aunt Dee means to you. I could come to her with anything and she'd give me advice about work, life... Dating. Yeah, she could pretty much get me to open up about anything. You know, one time she brought me fishing out here, I forgot the bait, so we used our lunch. I got nothing except the lecture about how I always go after the wrong type of... What about you? Did she ever meet any of your boyfriends? Yeah, I mean, she mostly disapproved of all of them. I can't blame her. I always went after the type of guy who was way too into his work. But it made it easy to avoid talking about the tough stuff, you know? Probably why my ex-boyfriend Jonathan... Wait, why am I talking about my dating? No one's forcing you to. But go ahead, well, you were telling me about Jonathan. You are trying to get me to open up, that's my tactic. You're using tactics on me? Now you're pivoting. Just tell me about Jonathan. Just tell me about Heather. What do you know about Heather? I don't know anything about Heather and that's my point. I don't know anything. You are a half open book in a dimly lit room. We were together for about a year, she was sweet, we went our separate ways. Why? When Aunt Dee passed, it brought back memories of my mom passing and I realized that life is short and Heather just wasn't the right one. Mom and Dee would have wanted me to be with the right person. As sweet as she was, Heather just wasn't it. Any regrets? Only with the way that I did it. I knew it was the right thing, for both of us. It's just I couldn't tell her why. I kind of feel bad about that. Well, you can still talk to her, it's never too late. I got one. Keep the line tight. Keep the line tight, yep. - I got one. - Wait a second, I got one too. - You got one too. - I got one too. You got a fish. Hello, everyone, it's candy creation time. We've given you the tools now it's up to you to combine them into something special. So dig in and pick out any ingredients you think you might need for the candy making competition on the last day of the festival. Will yours be Aunt Dee's next signature candy? Good luck. Hi. Hey, hi Maggie. How's the farm? Well, it's our second harvest, better than last year. - Excellent. - Yeah. Are you enjoying Aunt Dee's motorcycle? - It's a beauty. - Yeah. I'm honored she gifted it to me. I'm guessing you two were really close. Well, we got the farm after my wife passed two years back. And Dex and I wanted to change and boy, we sure got it. Dee helped us settle in, anything we needed and we took care of her. Dee became sort of a second mom to Dex. So when she passed, it was hard on him. It's that why he couldn't go the funeral? Yeah. I understand the Dee raised you and your sister since you were kids. As if we were her own. Don't give up on Dex just yet. He hasn't always been this way. Which way? You haven't noticed? No, I have, of course. You're not the first person to say that. It's been a rough year for him. What he needs is a friend. Can I let you in on a little secret? Always. Today's a special day for him. Here you go. All right, see y'all later. Hey, guys. - Hey man. - Hey. I didn't see you this morning. No, you did not. You never miss work. Well, there's a first time for everything. Okay. I met up with Heather this morning, we had a little chat. You? Had a chat? I took some advice that I got fishing. Fishing advice? You know what? I feel like there's some major weight off my shoulders. Oh, man, it's beautiful out there. Hey, son. Hey. Hi. Hi. Maggie's here with my dad, at his house, playing games, how wonderful. I invited her over. She mentioned how you struck up a friendship. Did she? I figured she'd like to partake in Aunt Dee's Maple walnut kick. Your favorite cake, your birthday cake. Happy birthday, son. Happy birthday, Dex. Thank you. What were we talking about? You were telling me about your farm? Well, it's a lot of work, but we love it. I only wish that Dex would find more time to spend on his dream. Dream? Well, he's been bottling maple syrup, he wants to mark... Dad, dad. Can I not be a proud father for one second? Look at this, he designed this himself. This is great. We should put it in the shop. It's Dee's candy shop, not Dex's. Okay, all right. Either way, why haven't you done anything with this? It's a small grove, it's just a hobby. You wanna try some? Yes, I do. So what do you think of it? That's really good. Every maple syrup grove has its own personality. It's just how you bring out the flavors. You should market it. You really should. I had a plan. But you know other things were more important. What if there were no obstacles? Then what? I might be afraid it would fail. So my first venture when I was just starting out, I fell in love with this company that made baby slings. You know, but for small dogs, precisely the reaction I would get. I helped pitch it to so many investors, no after no after no. Until my 14th pitch, my first yes. And that became Pup Sling. - Pup Sling? - Yeah. I've seen the commercials for it. You have stake in Pup Sling? A small amount. But sometimes you have to start small to go big. Dee used to say that. Maybe we just need to start small. We? Or you, us, you, however. Anyway, I should get going. Hey, hey. Yeah. Maggie, why don't we create a flavor together for the contest? Maybe we can even talk about our partnership. Sounds like a plan. I hope you had a good birthday. Not bad. Good. Hey, Zach, sorry to call so late, I need a favor. Thank you guys so much. Enjoy. Hi, Dex. Why are you smiling like that? You're scaring me. We have a surprise for you. Zach. We now present... Dex Walters Maple Syrup live and available for pre-order. I set up the online store. I got the label design from your dad. I appreciate the gesture, guys, it's a pretty big deal. Seems like it's happening really fast. That's the "surprise" part. Awesome. But I gotta go because I'm helping my dad with the Fall Festival at the farm today. Will I see you there? - Yeah, yeah, for sure. - Great. Okay? Here we go, ready set. Over here. Wide open. This place looks great. Heads up. Yeah, it's the second year, it's a good turnout. And you are a busy bee. It's really nice that you're having a little time for some football. Yeah, it is. Is it time for the taffy yet? I believe you are being summoned. You're just in time for the taffy demonstration. But before you run off, just a tiny request and you can't deny me because I'm your partner now. I just want you to take a look at something, okay? Five orders, already, and an inquiry from Middleburry about carrying your syrup at their Farmers' Market. I got five orders? Well, it's not gonna happen overnight. You mean there's already sales? Don't make me say I told you so, don't do it. Because I would love to. Come on, you wanna join us? The trick to producing the perfect maple toffee is you have to get it to just the rate heat between 235 and 245 degrees. Traditionally, it was done over an open fire just like this. Does anyone know how maple syrup was first discovered? Yes, Alyssa. People saw squirrels drinking it from the trees. Yes, exactly, A+. Legend has it that the Iroquois witnessed squirrels drinking the sap from the trees so they learned to tap the trees and use the sap to cure their meats. Now Vermont maple producers export their syrup to over 50 countries worldwide. Yes, Alyssa? When do we get to try the taffy? Yeah, when do we get to try the taffy? Right now, let's go. Now this is when the real magic happens when the syrup hits the ice. Good. Now wait 10 seconds and put your stick at the end of the syrup and then roll it up. Guys, this is one of the healthiest sweet treats you can have, right dad? - Absolutely. - Yeah. All right, kids now go ahead and give it a taste. What do you think? Scale of one to 10? You wanna come over here and try some? Yeah. Thank you. Do you want one? All right, yes, please. - Go now. - Okay. You put the stick in the end, just like that, let it sit there for one second. Now you're gonna roll it up. Okay. Nice technique partner. Back at you partner. Go. I win again. Good game. Is there anything she can't do? Nope, not really. Hey, you want to sneak out of here? What are you thinking? We have that new candy flavor we got to work on. I'm gonna need a ride because Jody dropped me off. Well, I see my ride, how are you getting there? Hop on. Hold on tight. I hope you didn't mind me taking the scenic route. Oh not at all. It's so beautiful out here. Yeah, this is my happy place. Aunt Dee used to bring us camping here when we were kids. Yeah, she told me. You know, she showed me this place. I come out here on my own sometimes, do some thinking. It's a good place for that. Dee and I would have some great conversations out here. Now, that surprises me. How does that surprise you? I don't know if you know this but word around town is you're a little bit of a closed book. If I'm a closed book, that makes you an epic Choose Your Own Adventure novel. That's right. Makes me feel like I'm a kid again. I love this. This is always my favorite part of camping. - Yeah. - Yeah. Oh I loved smores so much. One night, I had a bunch of them in my sleeping bag and Aunt Dee always told us never leave food in the tent. So we all go to sleep and then we wake up in the middle of the night to a bear just sniffing around, he wanted the smores. Jody and I screamed at the top of our lungs. Luckily we scared him away. It wasn't funny, it was really scary. No, I'm sorry. It's just that Dee told me this story. She did? She did, yeah. She said it was a raccoon. Yeah, raccoons can be scary in the middle of the night. I don't know they're pretty cute. Not when they're sniffing around in your sleeping bag. I spent the rest of the night in Aunt Dee's truck, nope. So Miss Choose Your Own Adventure novel, what was that about? Nothing. Nothing. I have a terrible poker face. There's this project I may have to give up on. I thought you never give up. Well, that's the confusing part because I do not give up. It just doesn't feel right, anymore even as the words are coming out of my mouth, I just, I feel like a failure. Aunt Dee always encouraged me to go out into the world and make something of myself and make her proud. And I feel like I did that, you know? It's just I'm starting to realize that well how just unfulfilling that's been. I guess when you work so much, it's hard to see it. I have a tough time letting go as well. No, you? Sometimes, you have to let go. Let go and freedom will flow. It's one of Aunt Dee's candy wrapper philosophies. I have an idea, we have to come up with a new candy flavor for the contest. Why don't we also come up with our own words of wisdom to use to keep her tradition alive? I don't think I'd be too good at that. Come on, just dig a little, okay? I'll go first. - Okay. - Okay. Your future starts today, not tomorrow. - That's good. - Yeah. Yeah, it's... I like that. Your turn. When in doubt, trust your instincts. Can you pass a graham cracker? Yeah, there you go. Thanks. When someone you love becomes a memory, the memory becomes a treasure. Share your treasure with those you love. Morning. Morning. Morning. What you doing? Just thinking. - Me too. - You too? Yeah, what are you thinking about? Just, you know... What are you thinking about? Just thinking, you know, about candy. Candy? Yeah, I'm thinking about our candy recipe. You ready to make the best flavor this town has ever seen? I am. Classic dark chocolate. With maple syrup and a hint of pumpkin spice. Submission complete. Mission complete. I can't, look at this. Hey, I'm going to clean this mess up. Do you wanna put this somewhere, yeah? - Yes. - Okay great. - Thank you. - No problem. Hey. Looks like you two are getting along. We're learning how to work together. It turns out you have to give a little, so I did. I don't know if it's being back in the shop or a change of pace or... Yeah, wait a minute. What? - You kissed him. - What? You did, you kissed him. You don't know what you're talking about. Tell me the truth. I am telling you the truth. And that is a lie. This is me you're talking to Maggs. Well, I'm not admitting anything. Clearly. Okay, we may have kissed. I knew it. Keep your voice down. Details? It just happened, last night, and then we haven't really talked about it or... Hi. You coming to the hayride? Well, I... Yes, she is and she might even have a date. - Jody! - Date? Do tell. - Hey, guys. - Hi, Dex. We gotta go. I just got here, I'm gonna get some candy. Well, maybe later, we got to go. You wanna go to the hayride with me? I would love to. We have been riding this thing since we were too little to climb up on it. That is true. Believe it or not, I was scared to get on it at first. I could see why. I wanna know who convinced Aunt Dee to start this tradition. That would have been Uncle Jim. It's where they first fell in love. - I have a confession to make. - Me too. You first. Well, I was checking out my new website, there's a few more sales. You're selling your syrup? Yes, I am. Right on, sign me up for a case. A case? Two? Does he get a discount with that? Yes. It's your lucky Day, Eddie. - Thanks, Dex. - Yeah. - Thank you. - Yeah. All right, why don't you tell me your confession. I'm really glad I'm your date. So am I. - Thanks for the drive back. - Of course. Maybe one day you'll let me drive it? Probably not. Fine. I had fun, thank you. Hey, you know what? We still haven't talked about - the deal. - The kiss. Deal, I just assumed that we were both avoiding it. Well, if you wanna talk about the deal, yeah, I'll be here. I mean, I'll be there, my home. I'm around, you know where to find me. Okay. Good morning. Good morning. You're up early. Always. Just poured myself some coffee, you want some? I would love some, thank you. How did you sleep? Great, great. You know, I forgot how nice it is to sleep in peace - and about the other night... - The kiss? Go ahead. No, you go. No, no, please, you go. Okay, I'll go. Jonathan. Jonathan? What are you doing here? I'm sorry for the drop-in. But I was thinking about what you said and I think I can help with your co-owner problem. I'm sorry, I'm Jonathan from Richardson and Murphy. I'm Dex, her co-owner problem. The maple syrup guy? Great, you're the one I wanna talk to, no offense, Maggie. Maggie was filling me in on your situation. - Situation? - We should talk. That's what we're doing. Privately. Okay, but I think Dex is gonna wanna hear this, trust me. I don't th... I know you don't wanna sell. But Maggie and I have a team of investors lined up that are just poised ready to bring this operation national. Operation? I never said operation. We expand maple candy production internationally using exclusively your syrup. And then we side market the surplus syrup to Japan. Japan? Yes, they go crazy for Vermont maple syrup. Do you have any idea how big the global market for maple syrup is? I have no idea but I'm sure you're gonna tell me. It's $500 million. $500 million, I had no idea. That's a lot of syrup. With your expertise and our investors, we can put an Aunt Dee's in every major city. Aunt Dee's face plastered everywhere. Aunt Dee becomes everyone's aunt. Did you help him put this together? No. I mean, no, not exactly. Don't be modest. She did, but it was with a different company, this is much better. Listen, I can explain, him... I mean, of course there is one other option, we could buy you out. There's an offer in there if that's the way you wanna go. Jonathan! I need some air. Dex, wait, please. Why do I get the feeling like this didn't go well? You are ridiculous. It's supposed to be windy tonight. They're just gonna blow all over the place again. Good. It'll give me another distraction tomorrow. Are you going to be mad at me forever? No, of course not. But you put this whole thing together behind my back. I didn't think of it that way. I thought that you'd be happy that I saved the deal for both of us. You were only supposed to be gone for two days. I know, I know. Look, my Aunt Dee gave him half of her business for a reason. And it wasn't for him to step away. She wouldn't want that, I don't want that. I understand. I need to go talk to him. Well, I'm staying at an Airbnb by the library. It's charming. The cell services isn't great so I'll be wandering around looking for higher ground. Talk soon? Thank you. - Hey. - Hey. Look, I am sorry that I made you feel like I went behind your back in any way, that is not what happened. When we got Aunt Dee's, honestly, I truly believed that the best way to honor her legacy was to make it the next great candy company. And yes, I went to Jonathan with that idea. But along the way, I started to want to honor your dreams for the company too. And now I don't know what the right thing to do is. I think I do. You're signing away your half? I just... I didn't think things would get so complicated. So, I'm taking the buy out, I'm stepping away. Good luck, I really mean that. He's selling his half? I've been trying to figure out what Aunt Dee would want us to do with the store and now I am more confused than ever. But I wanted to show you something. Aunt Dee left me this letter. And there is something inside of it that I thought she would want me to share. It's us from the first festival. I don't believe it. She left us a few surprises. What did the letter say? When someone you love becomes a memory, the memory becomes a treasure. Share your treasures with those you love. What do you think she's telling you? I thought I knew but now I don't. So that's it? You decided you're selling? Yeah. Yeah, if I sell my share, I can devote more time to the farm, help you with your workload. No, no, this is not about my workload, I like my workload. I thought you and Maggie, we're working this through. Yeah, so did I. So what happened? I guess I let my guard down. And what does that mean? I don't know dad, I mean... I thought I knew her, I guess I don't. You know Dee wanted us to carry on the shop together but Maggie had other plans. Besides, it is her family, right? Why am I gonna step in the way of that? I just wish that she'd been straight with me. Did you tell her that? Yeah. Yeah, just in not so many words. What? You, you are a man of not so many words. Talk to her, tell her how you are really feeling. You might be giving up more than just a store here. Dex, keep this close to your heart as a symbol of what we've started together. It's up to you to unlock the future. Dex, now, it's your turn. Write a letter to someone special to you, be vulnerable and express your true feelings. Keep it close, he's got the key. Hey, it's Maggie, please call me back, we need to talk. Maggie, is everything okay? Yeah, is Dex here? No, he took off on his bike, said he needed some time to think. I know exactly where he is. Could I? I'm way ahead of you. Thanks. I'd recognize the sound of that engine anywhere. What are you doing here? I got your letter. And you were right, it is the little things. You know, it's the laughter and the memories, but it is also the big things. It's being home, it's being with family and Aunt Dee's house and our shop, being reminded of everything and everyone that I love. It's like I was a closed book until you... We can do anything that you want with Aunt Dee's shop. I just don't wanna lose you. I don't wanna lose you either. I think it's pretty clear that Aunt Dee left us her shop because she trusted us. But she was also trying to bring us together in her own special way. Do you recognize this? Yeah, that's her music box. Yes, she loved this poem that's inscribed in it. "A wise old owl lived in an oak. "The more he saw, the less he spoke." "The less he spoke, the more he heard." "Now wasn't he - "a wise old bird?" - "A wise old bird?" So we tried to open it, but she didn't leave me the key. Wait a second. I had that. The key was attached to the owl. I had in my pocket before I left. Okay, so it fell off, it's gotta be somewhere. Yeah, but where? I don't know how we're ever gonna find it out here. I can't believe I lost it. It's okay. No, it's not. Aunt Dee left me the key, I finally figured out what it's for and I lose it. Look, if you wanna blame anybody, blame me, it was my fault. Your fault? Yes, because if I would have just been an adult and had a conversation, then you wouldn't have run off into the woods and lost your key. It's not your fault, it's my fault. You know what? It doesn't matter. It doesn't, we found what we were supposed to find. She wanted us to find each other. That's all that matters. Still, like she had a spare for everything. Wait a second, she had the words to the owl poem framed in her office. Dear Maggie and Dex, if you're reading this wrapper, you found each other and that couldn't make me happier. Trust your instincts and use your strengths, everything's better in twos. Now, the moment you've all been waiting for. Judges, you've sampled the sweets and now it's time to make your choice for the best new flavor. Ready, judges? And number nines all around, it's unanimous. That would be Fiery Cayenne Caramel, congratulations. And with that, it's time to close out the 30th annual Sweet Autumn Fest with treats and drinks and music, Aunt Dee style. Look at this, I've never seen this before. Maple sugar creams, icy maple crunch, blueberry maple squares. Looks like somebody was inspired by your maple syrup. Hey, where are you guys? You missed the... Hey, Dex and I have a business proposal for you. Can you come down to the shop? Yeah. - Hi. - There you are. Sorry we're late, - we had a little business. - It was a business. Happy fall fling. - Happy fall fling. - Happy fall fling. Speaking of business, there was a well-dressed guy looking for you earlier. You mean that gentleman? Sorry, Jonathan. It's nice to meet you guys, I've heard a lot about you. Well, we've heard a lot about you. Good to finally meet you. We are so sad this is your last night but we understand how busy you are. Yeah and she's about to get busier. We're launching a new line of Aunt Dee's candies. Inspired from the original maple bites. And if they're half as good as the maple pumpkin spice, then I think Aunt Dee's is gonna be household name across the country. And locally sourced, locally made. We're also expanding the website and online sales. Is that your specialty? - Actually... - That would be mine. Of course. I've got some really exciting ideas for the website. Loyalty programs, social media promotions, live chats. It's gonna feel like you're shopping in the store. From anywhere in the country, And eventually the world. That is great. Can I pre-order one of everything? You bet! So does this mean? It means that Jonathan will be running things in Minneapolis and I will be staying here. That's amazing, Aunt Dee would be so happy. This is my favorite. - Would you care to? - I would love to. - It's Ron, right? - Yeah. So tell me about the farm. Yeah, sure. Well, we've got all kinds of berries, we grow corn and then of course we have Dex's maple syrup. I'm just gonna go over there. Well done, partner. Back at you partner. You're gonna eat that? What does the wrapper say? Let the lady drive. What? Show me. Give me the keys. Show me. Give me the keys. Nice ride. Thank you. Is that a '66 Superhawk? It is. You don't see many of those. I know. Hop on. - Hold on tight. - You bet. RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM
