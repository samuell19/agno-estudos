How are you? Doing fine, thanks God. And you? Are you still working at the Zurich supreme court? Yes, I still work there as a translator. The work can be exhausting, but it's fine. Is it interesting as a job? It's ok, you know. But you know, I have a friend who works there as a lawyer. She told me about a strange case. One of her clients, a young Swiss woman... Commited a fraud. She tricked elderly people into giving their money to her. She would call an old woman and pretend to be her granddaughter. And the old lady believed her? Her victims were already in an advanced age... Not hearing well or showing signs of dementia. So the young woman told her desperately to be in need of money. And the poor soul went to the bank to withdraw the money. But just before the meeting, the wrong granddaughter would call her again. Saying she can't make it, so she would send her friend to pick up the money. And the old lady believed her again? Yes, because she believed that it was for her real granddaughter. This reminds me of a film I have seen recently. It was also about an old woman, and a fraud... Haven't you seen that film? What's the title? The title doesn't come to my mind. Or maybe the story you told and the film I saw are the same. But seriously, I have no clue what film you are talking about. Funny, Mohamed. Maybe it will come back to you. THOSE WHO ARE FINE Hello, my name is Türli from Everywhere Switzerland. First I would like to ask you... If you use the internet on a regular basis? But money does play a role for you, right? You don't like to pay more than you need to. I guess you have a mobile phone... And you spend time in the internet. Exactly, there are only benefits with this option. You feel uncomfortable about the modem in your room. Because of the radiation. Hello my name is Rutishauser from Dezentra health insurance. Am I disturbing, or would you have a moment for me? I can take some time. This is Dezentra. You probably haven’t heard about us because we are relatively unknown. We got independent and very low priced offers for your region. I am honestly very comfortable with mine. - Really? We are Everywhere Switzerland. May I ask some questions about your internet connection? For your own safety I need to check a few details about your identity. May I know your date of birth. And your place of origin? Does anyone else have the authorization to your account? It's just you. What about your current account balance? G886 753.89996. What‘s your approximate current balance? Around 29'000. Since my grandfather has died... We get much less money from her. Even for christmas. My grandmother sends us every year... An envelope with 20 Swiss francs. Although they are quite wealthy. How greedy. I have some friends who will inherit immense fortunes, it’s crazy. They won't need to work anymore. What about your wage here? You start with a salary of 22 francs per hour… And depending on how well you do, there will be a bonus. I hope my grandmother won’t die too soon. She has always been so sweet. Does she live in a home for old people? - Yes. And she shelters her whole fortune? No. The ones with the money are my parents. From my grandmother we won't inherit a lot, unfortunately. Not a lot at all. I guess my future children won't inherit a cent from me. This weekend I went to the exhibition in Kunsthaus Zürich. But I totally forgot the name of the artist. What was his name? I can't remember it. To be honest, it wasn't exciting at all. Have you seen it? No, I didn't have time. It really wasn't good. How is your sister doing? Is she back in shape? Did she have to stay in the hospital for a long time? Again and again, you know. That's hard. Altogheter she managed fine. But there were some issues with the health insurance. She had to pay way too much on top in the end. She had to pay on top? Our internet network is too slow. It really needs to get faster. You should check out Everywhere Switzerland. So inexpensive. You got it for your smart phone? Yes. Only 20 francs per month. All around Europe. All included. Sounds good. Damn, I can't get this melody out of my head. By an English singer... Do you know that film? It's a really great film I have seen recently. What was it called again? The story is about two policemen who fall in love. I have seen it twice already. It's great. Excuse me... I badly need a WLAN. I need to send an email for my work... But my mobile‘s data connection has failed. Maybe you can help me... By creating a hotspot. The password is... T19F... XP07... YT56... 7TZ5... Thank you a lot. Have a nice day. You are welcome. May I see an identity card? Sure. How can I help you? I would like to withdraw 50'000, please. You mean fifty thousand Swiss francs? Yes. Are you buying a new car? Ms. Oberli? Who knows. Now, Ms. Oberli, if you request to withdraw more than 25'000... You need to sign a document for legal purposes. Sure, just go ahead. Additionally, I will need your transcode to access your account. I don't have that with me. Don't you have anything with you, where you could... Like an email? How should I bring that with me? Do you have a smart phone? Do you have a smart phone? I‘ll help you with a Wi-Fi. Have you found it? Then I‘m happy to tell you the 14 digits password. 7, 2, 4, 3... 5, 6, 3, 7... 4, 4, 0, 4... 7, 2. Are you connected? Great. Now, if you look into your emails and search for USBS... You should find the word transcode with a 9 digits number next to it. Right, there is a long number there. Not the IBAN number, I need the transcode. Please tell me the code. 9... 7... 7... 7... 6... 4... 3... 9... 7. Thank you a lot. In order to complete the document I need some additional information. Is anyone else authorized to operate your account? It's just me. May I ask you about the reason why you need such a high amount of cash? I think that's none of your business. This is just standard procedure. Have you considered to... - It‘s for a family member. It's for your family? Have you considered the option to wire-transfer the money? No. That's why I am here. Do you and your family go on vacation together? You are a curious one, Mr... Vögeli. We just want to make sure, Ms. Oberli, that the information is accurate. In the end it‘s your security we are concerned about. It's for my granddaughter. She's a lucky one. One moment, please. Ms. Oberli? You must be Sarah. Exactly. The best friend. She has sent me here. Yes, she called me. That's it. Julia couldn't make it. What exactly happened to her? Just a small accident. Someone bumped into her car. Was she hurt? - She is doing fine, don't worry. She just couldn't make it, that's why she has sent me. So why don’t I try to call her. Yes, why not. Is this the correct number? Yes, that seems right. She doesn't pick up. I'm sure she will get back to you soon. Everything will be fine. I will tell her to call you. Tell her to call me immediately. Yes, I will. Don't worry. Everything is in order. Thank you, I wish you a nice day. - Goodbye, Sarah. Send her my love! - I will do that. Have you also heard about Dezentra? Dezentra, yes. They have quite low rates, right? That's what I heard, too. What are the price differences? Are they extreme? Or just peanuts? Or can you actually really save money? I don't know really. One can look into those offers for ever and ever. Every year there are new offers. One could change the insurance company every year. Once I did not cancel my contract per due date, and they made me pay for it. Oh well, all those health insurances. One should have more time to find good offers, but with our jobs... God knows, our work keeps us busy. You are right. - Please keep the exit free! What's in your bag? That's a Zalando package. It contains sneakers I‘m going to return. May I see the receipt? Yes, I have it in an email on my phone. Could you give me back my ID card? One thing at the time, Mr. Fischli. Why these security checks today? Bomb threat, by Email. Again at the main station. May I see your package please, Mr. Fischli? - Sure. Here it is. Shall I open it? - Yes please. Too small for you? No, no. They fit well. I just didn't like them too much. Maybe the next time they will. - I hope so. I put everything back inside, then? - Absolutely. Mr. Fischli, your ID card, your telephone. - Thank you. Have a nice day. - You too. It's great if you have a really low basic fee. I had a contract which was flat rate. But there were always some additional costs. One needs to make sure to be covered from all sides. You can't trust anyone anymore, not even the telecommunication companies. Hi there, security check. May I see your ID card. And Zurich is where you live now? - Yes. Let me check your bag, please. What's in the white envelope? - Some stuff for my tax documents. Just paper, right? I will scan you now. Please turn around. You may put the bag on the ground. Arms up, please. Thank you, have a nice evening. - You too. Did you take the navigation system? No. They‘ve all been taken, anyway. There aren't any left, as always. Let's just do it with your phone. Well, ok, but I tend to have internet problems. Internet problems? Right. Internet problems. What kind of internet problems? Just problems. Data volume. You have a crappy contract? Lenno. It's ok for me. It works for me. Don‘t you have unlimited internet? 1.5 gigabytes. There is this new one which should offer you unlimited data... Their commercials are everywhere. I know which one you are talking about... Really good rates. Everywhere Switzerland. It's just 19.95. - Or even 9.95. 9.95! How exciting. All included? Sure. Tutti quanti. And it works everyhwere? Sure. Well, everywhere in Switzerland. Morf speaking, Zurich City Police. Hey guys, can you hear me? Oh, Andy, it's you. A new case just came in. Another fraud. 50'000 francs damage. Can you take care of this? All right, the name of the claimant: Oberli, Elisabeth, born in 1932. She is still being treated right now though. You are already on the way towards ZQ7, am I right? Yes, that's it. I need you to turn around. I suggest that you pay a visit to the respective bank. Also, I recommend questioning the real granddaughter of the claimant. I'll send you the relevant coordinates immediately. Hang on a second. - Hello? The connection is bad? I can‘t hear you .. I‘ll send it to you. Right, yes. Thanks, bye. Which direction? Go straight. I still don't have internet. It says no network connection, but there is a 3G sign. But that offer... Everywhere Switzerland. That's a spectacular difference. That's like the half of any other offer. If it is really just 9.95. How much are you paying for yours? 39? Yes, ok, but I can call to all of Europe for free. All of Europe? Yes, for free! In my case it says Europe, asterisk... And then, zone 1. Zone 1 is like Germany, France, Italy. The normal countries. So for them, Europe is called zone 1. So somewhere like let's say, Serbia, is not part of it. Well, yes, but why would I make any calls to Serbia. Do you often call people abroad? No, not really. Where is your wife from? Is she... Swiss? She is Swiss now. We got married. How great. Beautiful! You must be Mr. Ailyev. Welcome to Heinrich Briner Private Banking Group. I will bring you to Ms. Tobler's office. Would you like to order anything to drink? Sparkling water. Mr. Sergei Ailyev, 10th of August, 1953 in Rybinsk... And the passport number... 7, 6, 8, 1, 2... 9, 9, 3, 8, 9.

Excuse me, I should install this outside. Right over there on the left, the code is Q773. As you probably know already, your grandmother has received a phone call... By a young woman, who pretended to be her granddaughter. Who pretended to be you. The woman said she was in desparate need of money due to an emergency. After that, your grandmother went to the bank... And whithdrew fifty thousand francs in cash. We now try to narrow down the field of likely offenders. And because she knew detailed information about you, she might be one of your Facebook friends. What are your privacy settings, on Facebook? I can't imagine though that anyone would... Excuse me. Great, very good. Thank you. Bye. Sorry, what was the question? How often do you see your grandmother? In a normal way, I guess. Once or twice per year. Mr. Siegrist. Policy number, 8430, 7814. Born in 1929. Madopar, 250 milligrams. Efixor. 100 milligrams. Cymbalta, 10 milligrams. Zythalopram, 100 milligrams. Deroxat, 250 milligrams. One unity each. Good. Ms. Rüegg. Rüegg... Policy number 1189, 3560. Born in 1938. How did she sleep last night? Not well at all. Ms. Demiri from the night watch said... That she was up all night. They had to force her to sleep. Did anyone visit her yesterday? No. No one. Does she have family? She has family. But they haven‘t shown up in a while now. Stilnox. Aurorix. Exelon, 250 milligrams. Haldol, thirty drops. Mr. Lazarovic. Let me turn the light back on. Who is sitting over there? - Where? Over there, on that chair. There isn‘t anyone there, Ms. Rüegg. Everything is fine. Focus on what you see here. House. A house? I would like to go home now. - I know. We will finish this together, Ms. Rüegg. Where were we? - There. What image is this? A balcony. This one you know. A family. It went well today, right? I want to go home. I will bring you to your room. Is that fine with you? Home? - Yes. I will get your rollator and bring you to your room. You did well today, Ms. Rüegg. Everyone listen up. We are starting a new campaign. We are offering a fixed line network. Advantage: No basic fee, very competitive per minute rate. Our target client is the elderly model, trustful people... The senior generation, so to speak. Never forget, you are selling with emotions. Make them feel that this minute on the phone is theirs. If you have an internet connection at home, you spend 25 francs without even using it. But if you change to our system... You don't have a computer! Do you have a smart phone? You don't have anything like that. It's about time to get one - Goodbye. No, that won‘t be neccessary. I guess you already have a health insurance? So I would like to inspire you with our offers. We offer the best rates in the region of Zurich. What about your client number? Ms. Kräntzlin? This is Giger from Everywhere Switzerland. Am I interrupting you, or do you have a moment for me? And what about your current account balance? May I ask some questions about your internet connection? I am 90 years old and don't have internet. Don't you need that anymore? I am calling you from the Dezentra health insurance. As a matter of fact, we have the best rates in the city of Zurich. That would be the question now: Did you often get sick these years? May I ask how old you are? 78 years. All right. In that case I recommend that you stay with your present health insurance. 340'000 francs. XC365, 7VZ... U890. QRP, 789, 64... NB, L4... Did Ms. Oberli show up by herself, or was there anyone with her? She was by herself. It‘s common for elderly clients to come to us to withdraw high amounts of cash. That's completely normal. In the case of Ms. Oberli, you think the culprit is Swiss? We are not allowed to tell you. But yes, generallly speaking, we assume that the majority of the perpetrators are Swiss citizens. That makes it quite difficult to find them. How big is your success rate? One needs to look at each case individually. It's fluctuating. Well, Ms. Türli... We reviewed your documents and and did the legal work. It all looks fine. Regarding your investment horizon and risk profile I have to inform you that... Unfortunately we can't make an exception concerning your minimum start amount. As an alternative we are able to offer you a securities custody account. It allows you to deposit your current amount with us. And as soon as you meet the required minimum we will open the requested account. I prepared the contract. Take your time to go over it. A copy for us. Here you can see your account opening amount of 822'000 Swiss francs. For your approval I need your signature on page four and six. Alright. You must be Mr. Deng and Ms. Li. Welcome to Heinrich Briner Private Banking Group. I will bring you to Ms. Tobler's office. Would you like to order anything to drink? Hey guys, it's me again. You must be on your way home, am I right? I have some more work for you. We have been passed the recording of a suspicious phone call. Another alleged fraud... The receiver of the call is called Frieda Rüegg, born in 1938... Resident in the Blaumeisli Hospital. Address is... Blaumeisliweg 26, Zurich. Blaumeisliweg 26. - That's it. You will receive the details of the doctor in charge shortly. But imagine if you would ignore a really bad disease, just to keep your insurance rates low... But you know, I never really get sick. So it pays off in my case. But otherwise this rate goes up. Incredibly fast. It doesn't really go up, because one also gets a reimbursement. Which one do you have? Aquilana. They also pay for my gym membership. Massages, everything. That's fantastic. There is this new one. Something like... Dezentra. But what about that address, Blaumeisliweg. Have you been able to fix your internet issues? I‘m actually still trying. I can see where we are... But somehow I can't enter the route. We would like to show you a recording we received from our data department. It‘s a matter concerning one of your patients. Rüegg? Hi granny, it's Tabea. Who? Tabea. Hi. Can you hear me? How nice to hear from you. - How are you doing? What should I say. Always about the same. I am calling you because I am not doing so well. As you know, I have lost my job. You‘ve heard about this, right? I was looking for a new job, and stayed with Markus, but he kicked me out. I just messed up everything. - It's going to be fine. The problem is, I really need some money now, to find a new apartment. And maybe I have a job interview in London so I‘ll have to travel there... And you know I can't ask mom. It would be around 30'000 francs. I will return it to you as soon as I can. Could you go to the bank today, maybe? Today? There is a bank just next to you, isn‘t there? You are the only one who can help me right now. Hello Ms. Rüegg. Zurich City Police. Morf, Binggeli. This is the money as discussed. Thanks for coming up to us immediately. Let‘s repeat the plan briefly. We are this dot here. You follow this way straight down the road. Just this way straight? - Exactly. And we will stay close to you. And nothing is going to happen? - Don't worry. You are absolutely safe. Goodbye. - See you later, Ms. Rüegg. Let's go. Ms. Rüegg? Hello, my name is Sarah. I am a good friend of your granddaughter, Tabea. Hello Sarah. As you know she could not come here because of a business meeting in London. That is why she has sent me. How is she doing? She is fine, except for some troubles with her job. Where is she now? - On her way to London. Do you know her well? We‘re very close friends. She told me that you would give me the money so I can transfer it to her via e-banking. And how will you give the money to her? As I said, I will transfer it via e-banking. You don't need to worry. She will get in contact with you, as soon as she has the money. Thank you so much. Goodbye, Sarah. I wish you a nice day. Goodbye. Hello, Zurich city police. Binggeli, Morf. May we see your ID card? - Sure. Thank you very much. You are Ms. Alice Türli? - Yes. 10th of November, 1992. - Very good. Born in Gmürlos, cantone of Uri. CHE... 548... 944... 76. Have you found her? - Yes. Thank you. Now we would like to have a look at the white envelope you are carrying with you. Ten... that's right... twenty... twenty five... Thirty thousand Swiss francs! Correct. Very well. Ms. Türli, may I ask you to come with us? UX, 89... ZN, 16... 27, IP... 63, 19. It works, thanks. Crazy, that reminds me now of that movie. What was its title again? There is this scene in which the terrorist gives a password to another guy. The terrorist is dressed as a banker and tells the password to a real banker. That then activates the bomb and the entire bank blows up. Meanwhile, the CEO of the bank runs amok. This all happens unrelated to the terror attack. Countless money transfers are taking place in that bank. It's a big one, like the European Central Bank. When it explodes, all the banknotes and stocks, all these papers whirling in the air! It's all crazy, and in slow motion. And the music... What was the music like? It wasn't this classical film music, rather something minimal. And then it was just like fireworks. You don't know which film I'm talking about, right?
