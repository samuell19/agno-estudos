What am I doing here? For 20 years I've been running around the valley for that smug bastard. Doing all these stupid little errands he sends me on. He owes me this promotion. I deserve it and he knows it. And he better fucking give it to me or I'm finished. -Hola! -You speak Spanish? -No way man, I'm trying to soak up the Mexican culture while I'm in L.A.. I can't stand those grimy little bastards, but I love their culture. Come on in. -Kain wanted me to drop this off. -Yeah yeah senor, welcome to my micasa. -I'm in kind of a hurry. -Just for a second. We talk, no? -All right, all right, all right. -They rent by the week so I figured how bad could that be, huh? -Nice picture, here you go. -Thanks. Sit down please. We'll order up some tacos, drink some Dos Equis. -Listen, I gotta go. -Okay, no tacos, how about burritos? -No thanks. -You know what this for? -Not really. -He's paying me to kill two cops. You knew that, yes? You must have known. -I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. Kain said you were old friends and you needed to borrow some money. And if you're involved in some murder plot which I have absolutely no involvement in or knowledge of, then you need to go straight to the police and confess your crimes young man. Is there someone in the bedroom? -No way man, don't go getting all loco on me, okay? -Freeze scumbag. -Ho! Shit. Guess what, you're under arrest. Nice shot partner. You can't play the bad cop. -I'm playing the bad cop. -You know what happened last time you played the bad cop? -Yeah, it wasn't my fault, I didn't know it was a plastic bat. -That's my point. It's not the kind of guy you can scare. -Because I'm a woman? -I didn't say that. It's just your not an intimidating person really. -You keep this up, and I'm gonna slap a sexual discrimination suit on you and this whole department. -Okay, we'll try it your way honey, but when it doesn't work, follow my lead and I'll be the bad cop. -No. If it doesn't work, you follow my lead. -All right, we know you work for Kain Lawton. -Lots of people work for Kain Lawton. -Yeah, but we know you're his courier. -So? -Listen jackass, we heard you say you helped him set up the hit. You're an accessory to commit murder. -What? I never said that, play the recording. -Recording broke. -Oops. -Hey what are you doin'? What the hell is this? -So we got an eye witness and two veteran cops who heard you setting up the murder. - All right, all right. Hang on a sec. Let's hear what he has to say. -Kain said it was a loan for a friend. -A loan? -Yeah, a loan. -You know what? I believe you. -Thank you. -But a jury won't. -What? -Well think about it. My partner here is willing to testify that she heard you set up the hit. I think a jury's gonna believe whatever she has to say. She's a decorated officer. Everyone loves her. -Not everyone. -Hey buddy, you been in this career for 20 years. 20 long years. I think the jury's gonna believe that you knew exactly what that money was for. -But he didn't tell me anything. -Well if he told you something, maybe I can offer you witness protection. -What? Witness protection for this piece of garbage? -Think about it man, a condo on a golf course in Arizona. $3000 a month, tax free. Condo's paid for, use that money to buy food, booze, those hookers you like so much. It's a pretty sweet deal man. What's it gonna be Rob? You gonna play ball with me, or gonna be a stupid little shit? Huh? -No, I'm not gonna flip. -Listen Rob, you better start wising up. The alternative is hard time with a bunkmate named Bubba who hasn't seen a woman in 20 years. You wanna be Bubba's bitch? -All right, all right, all right, lemme handle this. Yes. -This is crazy. -Hey hey hey, it's not fucking crazy man, it's a fucking deal. It's the last one you're gonna fucking get. So you fucking play ball with me or that deal's fucking gone. - I can't do it, I'm sorry. -Hold on a second, calm down. How flexible is your asshole Rob? Have you ever been with two men at once? I'm not gonna lie to you, it can hurt a lot. -So what's it gonna be Rob? Drinking margaritas on the back nine, or do laundry for, I don't know, say 20 years for a few thousand California's finest? -I need to talk to my lawyer. -God damn right you do. Come on let's get the fuck out of here. -So what's the deal? -You got a hearing in three days. I'm gonna try and get your bail extended, but be prepared to be taken into custody. Chin up, everything is gonna be awesome. We'll probably get a settlement out of this for police brutality. You watch, you're gonna end up making a tightly little sum from all of this. This just might be the best day of your entire life. -I doubt that. -Hey, positive thoughts. Kain wants to see you tomorrow at nine a.m. sharp. -Okay. -I'll see you in court on Monday? You just wait, everything is gonna be super grandtastic baby. Best day of your life. -Happy birthday. What's wrong? -I didn't get all the details, but I knew he wasn't giving him 20 grand because he liked the way he looked. -Fucking Kain. You've been loyal to him for 20 years and this is the shit he does to you. -Yeah, and with a slimy tongued ball licker lawyer representing me, I'll get lucky if I don't get the electric chair. -Maybe we should take the deal? -No, I can't. -Why not? It would be good for both of us. -Yeah, but, -No buts! We could use a change of scenery. I could get a nice part time job at a pet store taking care of the animals. And you could run every day and do 10k's every weekend. I'd have time to cook some actual food. Baby, we would live the nice, quiet life we've always dreamed of. -Yeah maybe. - Look. It's after midnight, you're officially over the hill. - Thanks. -Happy birthday, my love. Come on. -What? -I have a surprise. -What is it? -It's a surprise. But I will give you a hint. -All right. -It involves my mouth, and your penis. -Mmm. You're a great wife. -I have my moments. Where are you going? -Kain wanted to see me first thing this morning. -What about the deal? -We've known each other our whole lives. He'll take care of me. -Go on. -They want you, Kain, bad. They're gonna keep pouring sugar on his deal until he flips, and eventually he will. -Thanks Emory, that's good to know. -What'd he say? -I have some fantastic news for you. -Really? -You're not going to jail. -What about the hearing on Monday? -You're not going to that either. -What's going on? -How would you like an all expense paid trip to a little country in the southeast of Asia? -Okay, but for how long? -Forever. I'm gonna give you $500,000. -I don't know what to say. -In some of these small countries, $500,000 should last you for the rest of your life, easily. -Gina always could stretch a dollar, but Kain, are you sure? -It's a win-win. You get to live in a tropical paradise, and I'm secure knowing the police will never ever be able to find you. You've been loyal to me for decades, you deserve this. -Are these cops really gonna stop looking for us? -They're not even interested in you. They're not even interested in me. They're just trying to pinch me for a couple of bucks. -Fucking assholes. -Are you guys in a position to just pack up and leave? -Um, hadn't really thought about it. But I think we can make it work. -I'll get you a couple passports, some tickets, little seed money to get you started. I'll send Scotty over to your place in a couple hours. -What about the 500? -I'll get it to you, don't you worry about that. Don't wanna travel with that kinda money. Trust me. -Okay. -Just one last thing. -Yeah? -Don't you ever flip on me. No matter what happens, no matter how bad things get, don't you ever, never, flip on me. -You have my word. If we're living on Kain's dime, I don't have to be a rat. -The guy is a murderer. What makes you think he's not just gonna kill you too? Rob? -I've been with him since the beginning, he wouldn't do that to me. -I don't like it. -I'll pick you up in a few minutes, we'll get our stuff, and get out of here, okay? -Okay. -All right, I love you. -Love you. Don't forget to get grandmother's clock. -I won't forget. All right, bye. -Yo, so how we gonna do this? -I'm gonna knock on the door, and when he opens it, I'm gonna punch him in the throat and poke him with this. Then we just wait for him to pass out. -Do you think maybe um, you know, I could do the punch? -You can forget it. You just watch and learn. -Well, can I at least poke him with the needle? -I'll let you knock on the door and that's it. -All right fine. - Hey Robby, Kain sent me over here to drop off your birthday present. Open up man, this bag is heavy. -You want me to pick it? -Yeah, pick the lock. Guns are the last resort. Kain wants it to look like he fled, not like he was murdered. -Okay, gotcha. -Blood splatter with a knife is just the same as a bullet. If you're gonna stab him, don't pull out the knife. -I gotcha. -Up the stairs. - Okay, okay. -His bag is still sitting on his bed. -Yeah, look like he stepped out for a minute. Nah, he's not gone, all his stuff is still here. Got it. He want us to wait for him here. -That's weird, he forgot his phone. -Just means that he's close by and he'll be back soon. -So he pays us five grand a month just to sit on our asses and do these little errands. - He pay me a hell of a lot more than that. -Of course. -You just stay alert. Things can go sideways real quick. -Don't worry about a motherfucking thing. I was born to do this shit. The injection will just knock him out? - It'll take a few minutes, but yeah. - And then we just dump him in a hole in the desert? - That's the plan. -I'm hungry, you hungry? -It's not time to eat. -What's the big deal if we eat some of his food? He's gonna be dead in a few minutes, he's not gonna care. You like Indian? -Holy shit! -What, it's not that bad. -Hands up, both of you. Tie his hands. Tie his hands! -Hey Rob, how's it going? -Good. -Coming over tonight to watch the Dodger game? - Uh yeah sure. -Don't just tell me yes and then not show up, I mean, I either gotta cook an extra Dodger dog or I don't. -Grab my knife and cut these things off. -Everything okay? You seem kinda jumpy. -Rob, where are you? I'm just gonna walk home. - What the hell am I gonna do with him if this thing does knock him out? -Hey Rob, what are you doing here? Oh know you didn't. It's been a while since I've choked someone to death. In all the years we've known each other, did you think I'd be the one? Did ya? Think, think, think. Where can I take him? Yeah. Aunt Margaret's house. It'll be empty for weeks. -Can I help you? -LAPD, we have a warrant to search this entire complex. -Oh, okay, yeah. Come on in. -Well, well, what do we have here. -Looks like a full kilo. -Yep. -Excuse me. Can you come in here for a second? -Okay. -So, you know anything about the drugs we found on Mr. Lawton's desk? -What? No, he hates drugs. -Where is he? -Really, I don't know. He missed his 12 o'clock appointment. He never misses an appointment. -What are you doing? -Don't worry about it. -Where are we? -You promised me $500,000 and you're gonna give it to me. -Sure Rob, whatever you say. Why don't we take a nice little walk down the street to the bank? -Why? Why couldn't you just give me the money and let me go? -What are you talking about? That's exactly what I was doing. -Bullshit. I heard Scotty say that you told him to drug me and drag me out to the desert and kill me. -Scotty's an idiot. -Yeah he is. But he's also loyal and he follows orders. -Wanna consider your options carefully. You gotta chance to get out of this alive. But if you keep doing what you're doing, you're gonna end up dead. - Kain? -No it's me. -Yo, it's him? -Got him right here. I want the $500,000 he promised, and I want it today. -Don't give him a penny. - I'm gonna kill him. - He ain't gonna kill shit. Grab his wife, make a trade. -What are you doing? -Whatever the fuck I want. -You're gonna call 'em back. -I ain't gonna call nobody. In about 15 minutes, my men are gonna be gang raping your wife. -Where are you? - Yeah? -Listen, I'm gonna kill your boss if you don't bring me the money. -Look I'm sorry buddy, but we don't work for you. We work for Kain and he told us not to pay you. -Listen dipshit, we not gonna pay you a dime till Kain tell us to. -How long did he know this guy for? -I don't know. Since they were kids. -That don't seem a little harsh to rub out a childhood friend? -No, he's fucking rat. -I heard he refused to talk. -That's bullshit, he's a rat. -That don't make you a little nervous? I mean where does it end for us? Maybe one day he decides to have us rubbed out too. -Just don't be a rat and you'll be fine, okay? Shhh. - Hey Gina. -Oh, hey Tristan. -I saw Rob a little while ago, he was acting kinda weird. -Yeah, we got a lot going on. -I'm gonna grab her from behind, I'm gonna cover her mouth. I want you to hogtie the shit out of her. - I invited him over to watch the Dodger game, but he kinda blew me off. - Well, sorry, he's really busy. -You can come. -Oh, um, I'm kind of busy too. -Yeah, that's what he said. I wasn't sure if he was telling me the truth, or if he was just jealous of our friendship. -Hold on a second. -That's rude, we're having a conversation. -Hello? -Gina, thank god, listen. -What's going on? -Don't go back to the house. He's sending his two goons to kidnap you. -What? -Don't go anywhere near the house. -Too late! -Shit! -Gina! Who the hell are you? -Mind your own business, bud. - This is my business bitch, I live next door. -They almost fucking had me. -Go to a hotel, pay cash. Don't tell anyone where you're staying. -Like hell I am. I am going to the god damn police and telling them what's going on and you are too. -No no no listen. He's gonna give me the money. -Like hell he is. -Just, just give me a little more time. -We're both going to end up dead. -No we're not, please, go to a hotel. I'll call you later. Gina? Gina? You're calling Scotty and telling him to bring us the money. -Nope, not gonna happen. - Yes, it is. -More than a dozen men have pointed a loaded weapon at me, some of 'em even took shots. But not a single one is still alive. Put down the gun now. Rob, you got a pinky dick and the balls the size of peas. -Shut up. -You're not gonna shoot me. Untie me, put down the gun before you make me really angry. -You're making the call. -Get that gun out of my face. Now you've done it you little piece of shit. Untie me now. Now, now, now, now, now, now, now. Untie me now. Now, now, now, untie me now. Now, now, now! Don't step out of this garage! Get back in here. I will not be treated like an animal! Get back in here and untie me now! - Seven vehicle returns at 72 and Dearborn and go to to door, one five suspects inside one for 211 suspects armed southbound Harvard Freeway, 1507 new location. -Who is he? -Who knows? But you know who lives here? -Who? -Rob Carobrese. -Rob? Isn't that just one hell of a coincidence? -We need to get him in here ASAP. -Yes we do. -Officer. - Yes. -I want a list of every relative within a hundred miles of here, brother, sisters, grandmothers, aunts, uncles, everyone. -Got it. -Hey Rob. Are you starting to get hungry? I'm starving. Do you think we could order a pizza? You know what Rob, I've been doing a lot of thinking and I give in, you win. -Really? -Yeah. I hate losing but, this is so stupid. You're eventually gonna wear me down and get what you want anyway, so might as well get this whole thing over and done with. -You make the call and I'll feed ya. -Nah, I've gotta eat first. The banks are closed now. You're gonna have to wait till the morning anyway. So we might as well eat. -Yeah, all right. -Oh, don't forget, extra pepperoni and sausage. You can't have too much meat. -Awesome. Keep the change. Pizza's here. -Aww yeah. -Like being served. -Nice. I am fucking starving. What the fuck is this? Priscilla's Pizza? -So? -Mother fucker. You're un-fucking-believable. -What? -How long have you known me? When have you ever seen me eat one motherfucking bite of Priscilla's Pizza? Get that fucking shit out of here. -Oh come on, it's not that bad. -Like fuck it ain't! That shit's an abomination. That's a waste of flour and sauce. Get that fucking shit out of here. I'm getting you what you want. The least you can do is show me some fucking respect. Get me some premium pizza. -I had to bribe Pieworks guy a hundred fucking dollars to drive this thing out here. -Aww, what a shame. I'll tell you what I'll do, I'll add $100 to the 500,000 fucking dollars I'm about to give you. -Shut up. -Mmm. Mm mmm. That is the best pizza I've ever tasted. Pieworks sure knows how to make a good pizza. Totally worth the extra effort paying for premium pizza. That's why you never made it in this business. Missed too many of the small details. -I never made it because you kept promising to promote me and you never did. -No, you never made it because of you. In this business you get what you take. You didn't take anything, so you got nothing. -That's not true. You kept telling me to hang in there. -Do you want the god's honest unfiltered truth? -No, I don't think I do. -Fuck, I'm gonna give it to you anyway. See in this business, takes a certain skillset. Either born with it or you learn it. But who the fuck cares? The fact is, you don't have it, and you're never gonna make it. -And you don't think-- -Fuck no, you're just a fucking courier and that's all you're ever gonna be. -That's not true. -Do you remember Jimmy Nunsy? -Yeah, I remember Jimmy Nunsy. -I killed him when I was 17. -You did? -I just came over from England, didn't know anyone, no friends, there was Jimmy fucking Nunsy. Selling weed, popular, hot fucking cheerleader girlfriend. I can sell weed. Why couldn't I be popular and have a fucking hot girlfriend? So I slit his throat. Cut his body up into small pieces. Went fishing with him off Dana Point. I caught a 50 pound halibut. That night I slept like a baby. It was right then and there I realized I had what it takes to make it in this business. I could be trusted to make the hard decisions and not think twice about it. -You're wrong about me. -No I'm not. Don't you think that if I were in your shoes right now, wouldn't have the money already? - No. -Can't even bring yourself to hurt me. -You have no idea what I'm capable of. -You don't have what it takes to make it in this business and you should have realized that years ago. You didn't. It's not my fault. That's on you. You took all of the stupid jobs I sent you on as my courier, all the little errands, taking all the risk with no real upside. That's a sucker bet, you're the sucker. -I'm gonna get that money. Or I'm gonna kill you. Now make the fucking call. -I'm not calling anyone. -But you said! -So? The only person I'm gonna call is your wife to find out how big Scotty's dick is. Now you listen to me you little fucking bitch. Eventually I'm gonna pull this dolly apart and when I do, you're gonna be the sorriest son of a bitch that ever lived. I promise you that. - Fucker thinks he's so smart. But he couldn't tell the difference between Pieworks and the cheap-ass pizza I made him eat. Mmmm, fuck that's good. Pieworks really knows how to make a premium pizza. -What the fuck are you doing? -I'm not gonna let you talk to me like this anymore. -I'll talk to you any way I fucking want. -Well, I'm not gonna listen. -All right, that's it. I'll give you the money, I'll make a call. -I gotta prove to you and myself that I can do this. -I'll make the call. I'll make the call! -I'm gonna torture you for five minutes. After that, I'm gonna give you the chance to make the call. -I'll make the call. I'll make the call. I'll make the call! I'll make the call! I'll make the call! I'll make the call! -Okay maybe five minutes of torture was a bit too long. -Kain. -Tomorrow morning go to the bank and get the fucking money. -$500,000. -Yes, $500,000. -Are you sure boss? Sounds like you're being coerced. -Of course I'm getting coerced! What the fuck difference does it make? Go to the bank tomorrow, get 500 fucking thousand dollars, stop asking stupid fucking questions, okay? He's gonna drill ever square inch of my body. -Okay. Where are you? -Get the money tomorrow morning, right and call me, I'll give you the address then. -Thanks for patching me up. -Ah, it's the least I could do. -Nah, it's cool. I done some pretty messed up things to people in the past. And I never bothered fixin' 'em up later. Even after I got what I wanted. -Hopefully this whole thing's over tomorrow, and you can see a doctor. -Don't worry, it will be. So have you thought this through? I mean, really thought this through. Yeah, sure, they're gonna show up with the cash, they're not just gonna give it to you. If you want it, you're gonna have to take it. -Yeah of course. I got a bulletproof plan. -I certainly hope so. -You better start wising up. The alternative is hard time with a bunkmate named Bubba who hasn't seen a woman in 20 years. -So what's it gonna be Rob? Drinking margaritas on the back nine or doing laundry for I would say 20 years for a few thousand of California's finest? -Maybe we should take the deal? We could use a change of scenery. Would be good for both of us. -All right, you got me. What the hell you doing out here? -I tracked him to his dead aunt's house. He seems to be laying low. -Any sign of Lawton? -Nope. - Fuck! -Gonna move on in the living room. -Whatever you say. Got you mother fucker. God this reminds me of the first time I ever suffocated someone. It was a grandmother of a girl-- She found out I was married. She was gonna tell my wife. What a rotten thing to do, right? Come here you little pussy! Come here! You little fucking weasel. If you let me die, you'll never get a penny! -It's his aunt's house. He's out on bail, so he's not breaking any laws. -Got it. -See this? That's the one we want. -We found a kilo of cocaine in his office. You don't want that scum on the street do you? -No ma'am. -The trick is if you can get in there, you can ID him, and get a warrant. Get a warrant, we can arrest him. -Aye aye Captain. -Oh hold on one second. What's the difference between being a terrible cop and a great cop? -A great cop will get into that house no matter what. -And a terrible cop is gonna walk back here with his tail between his legs. -Lives will be lost if we don't get this guy off the street this morning. -Don't worry. I did door to door sales in college. And I was number one in my region for eight consecutive months. I can talk my way into any house. -Go get 'em tiger. -It's 500 fucking grand, I'm not just gonna give it to ya. -Why not? Don't I deserve it? -If you can get it, you deserve it. You know, I'm glad you drilled holes in my feet. Nearly gas me to death. -Yeah right. -No I'm serious. It's moments like this that you get the most clarity in life. -Now you're just fucking with me. -No, I'm serious. I know I'm a borderline sociopath. -Mmm you're not borderline. -I am, I took an online test once. I was borderline. I lack conscience, I have no empathy. I don't have a narcicisstic personality disorder. A full blown sociopath is very impulsive and does not consider the consequences. I spent my whole life considering consequences. -I stand corrected. -I don't feel guilty for the things that I've done. I don't feel guilty for not feeling guilty. I wonder if I'd applied myself to a legitimate career how far I coulda gone. Maybe it's not too late for me. -It's not. It's not too late for any of us. -For you maybe. -You can do what you want, but if I get this money, I'm gonna slip away to a third world country and I'm gonna do it right. -Well part of me hopes that you do. -Yeah, it's the other part I'm worried about. -I'm serious. It's a romantic idea. Doesn't mean I'm gonna make it easy for ya. But I hope ya get it. -Thanks. -Hey there partner, name's Jim Hasslup. I'm a local realtor. Can I come in for a second? -Uh, no, I'm kinda in the middle of something. -Listen, I've got this nice young couple that really loves the neighborhood and they think that this house could be the perfect fit for them. -That's great. - Yeah, I think they're gonna make an offer this afternoon. -I'll make sure I let the family know. -But I need to take a few pictures for them. -Sorry, this place is a mess. They're repainting and everything is -They're not gonna care. They just wanna get a feel for the layout. -Can you come back this afternoon? -No, I'm running an open house the other side of town. Gonna be tied up all afternoon. -What about tomorrow? - Not in this market, fella. Look, I don't wanna let a buyer sit on this over night. They're ready to make a deal. We'll be in escrow by tomorrow. Come on, come on, it's only gonna take a second. What? You got a dead body in there? -Listen man, I can't let you in. It's really not my call. I'm just the cousin, ya know? Trying to clean the place up a bit. Call Michael, that's her son, maybe he can let you in. -Okay I'd love to. I'll call him right now. What's his number? -Uh, I lost my phone so I don't have his number on me, sorry. -That's it? That's it? That's your fucking best number one sales guy for six straight months effort? -It was eight months. -That was a pretty weak effort officer. You might wanna reconsider your career choice. -He shut the door in my face. What was I supposed to do? -If Lawton's in there, we're gonna need his help. -All right. All right, look, let's call his attorney and we sweeten the deal. -Yeah, we'll offer him 80 grand a year and a full three bedroom house. -Are you guys authorized to do that? -Well, the question is not whether we're authorized, the question is is he dumb enough to believe it? -The whole witness protection program is only quasi-legal anyway. -And before he realizes what happened, he'll be living in a shitty one bedroom apartment for the rest of his life, already having testified. -We'll apologize and say it was a clerical error. -And a very very bad man will be serving three to four life sentences. -And you can do that? -Do you want the criminals to win? -No, of course not. -Ya got a lot to learn about law enforcement son. -I'm sorry, I just didn't know that's how it worked. -Hey Robert, did they call yet? -Not yet. -Well, I hope you're ready to die. -I am, thanks. -Good, 'cause that's exactly what's gonna happen. -We'll see. -I'm not kidding. These guys are fucking animals. I don't mean to be a dick, but if you wanna live, you should probably get the fuck out of here. -And do what? Go back to my apartment and wait for you to kill me? -Yeah, probably wouldn't go back to your apartment. -I got no other options. This is my one chance and I'm gonna take it. It might not work. Then again it might. -You're not thinking clearly. I'm just trying to help you out. Don't say I didn't try and warn you. -Believe I won't. -Help me to the bathroom, I need to go take a leak. -You can wait. -Like fuck it can. Help me to the bathroom now, I need to take a piss! -What are you doing here? -Nice to see you too. -Sorry, but it could be dangerous. -No shit, that's why I'm here to get you. -Look, it's almost over, they're bringing the money this morning. -Your lawyer just called me. -All right, close your eyes. -What? -Just close your eyes and don't open 'em until I tell ya, okay? -Okay. -All right. -Jesus Rob! What the hell are you thinking? -I told you to keep your eyes closed. -Hey Gina. -Hey Kain. -What'd the lawyer want. -He said they're sweetening the deal. They're gonna give us $80,000 a year and a full stand alone house, not some cheap-ass condo. -Are you sure? -Yes. And we won't be fugitives and we won't have to worry about Kain trying to find us. -Believe me if I flip on Kain, we'll have to worry about him. -He'll be in jail. -Really? $80,000 a year? -That's what he said. -Come on, babe. I can't do it. Gina, I'm sorry. -You've got to get over this macho honor amongst thieves bullshit. -When I went to work for Kain that was the one thing he made me promise, I wouldn't flip. -He tried to kill you. -And I knew he might. That's part of the deal. And not I'm trying to pinch him for the money. -It doesn't have to be this way. -He's a lot of awful things. But he won't go to the police and tell them I kidnapped him and try to have me arrested. He'll handle it himself, and that's what I'm doing. You're asking me to do the one thing I can't do. It might not be right, it might be totally stupid. -It is. -But I'm just not gonna do it. Where would I be if I threw away the one rule that I have? -Shit Rob. -Trust me. -Just be careful, okay? -I haven't pissed my pants since first grade, just get me a fucking bottle and I'll piss right here. -You need to shut the hell up. -You did not just slap me. Oh now you fucked up. Now you done it, that's it, you fucked up! -We're gonna go in with a bag full of paper and if everything checks out, we come back and get the money. Got it? -Got it. Are we going to give it to him? -It's Kain's money, so it's Kain's call. We work for him, remember? -Yeah, I remember. -You got the money? -Yeah, I got the money. Tell us where you are. -I've been thinking. I'm not sure this is the life for me. -What the fuck are you talking about? -The sneaking around, the guns, the killing. And the knives. Fuck me Scotty, I didn't know we were gonna be involved in some hand to hand combat. -What did you think? We were selling Girl Scout cookies? -I haven't slept a wink since we started. -Oh fuck me, are you serious? -Yes. This shit is not for me. I was not cut out for this. -All right fine, but you're gonna have to tell Kain. -I know. -He's gonna go ape shit on you. He might not let you quit. You know that right? -Yeah, I know. -Shit. Now I'm gonna have to find somebody else to train. Thanks for being a big fat unshaven pussy. -I'm sorry. -This is gonna set my promotion back at least another couple months. Jesus fucking Christ. You better get your shit together and man the fuck up. You understand? -Yeah, of course. -And if I get so much as a scratch on me, I will pound your ass into the pavement. You got it? -I got it. -Put your guns in the flower pot. - Sure, no problem. -What the hell is going on now? -I don't know, maybe they're paying him off? Ready to redeem yourself? -I guess so. -Lemme see the money. -Sure, have a look. -Throw the bag over here. Hey, what are you trying to pull? -We got company. -Any chance I could get those pictures now? -Oh shit. -Who the fuck is that? - Shhh. It's the realtor, just be quiet, he'll go away. - I can hear you. -We need to get in there. -Jesus Christ. -I'm not going away until you let me in and let me get some pictures. -That's not no fucking realtor. -Oh hey there big guy. -Darren, cut me loose! Come on! Hold 'em off. Did you hear me? Get your shooter, hold them off. -Okay. -Get out of there now. -Take a long good look. This is gonna be you next. That was fun. Not as much fun as I'm going to have killing you. Kneel. How would you like to die? Maybe I'll kick your head in. Slice an artery, watch you bleed out. Maybe I'll twist your stupid fucking head off with my bare hands. You shoulda let me take that piss. 'Cause no matter how I kill you, first thing I'm gonna do, take a long hard piss all over your fucking body. Let's start off with a nice gunshot. Doesn't matter, we'll just do this old school. Nice strangulation's going to be in order. Well? Don't be a pussy. Don't fuck this up, you'll never get this chance again. Do it! -You're right. I wasn't meant for this. I don't have it in me. -So what are you gonna do? Take the plea bargain? Turn me in? -No. I'm not a rat. -So what are you gonna do? -I don't know. -You're cagey as fuck. Loyal to a fault. Should have promoted you. -It's a little late. -Hey, don't forget your money. You deserve it. -It was newspaper. -You never carry cash to a hot situation. You always keep it by, in case you need it. Check the trunk. Sorry Rob. - I didn't think you'd be able to let me have it. -Oh thank god! -You okay? -Are you okay? -Yeah. ♪ Train man strap your boots on ♪ ♪ Hops some beam and southbound ♪ ♪ Barreling to who knows where ♪ You don't know where Kain was right. I was the sucker. I spent 20 years pursuing something I never really had any chance of succeeding at. What a waste. He didn't give me the promotion because I didn't deserve it. I took nothing, so I got nothing. Until today. I wonder if 500,000 grand is gonna last us the rest of our lives or not. Who knows? Maybe I can turn my story into a halfway decent screenplay.
