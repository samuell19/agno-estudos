"My friend the squirrel was there this morning. "He gave me a wink. "A Glance ... "I said see you tomorrow." See you tomorrow. Agostino, my coffee, quickly! Agostino! Pilar! My coffee! You're serving? It's her little girl's communion. You've given her a day off? A week... Portugal's a long way. I won't pay for you to do their job. It won't kill me this once. And I like being alone in my kitchen. Everyone has their place... you're Madame Pujol...don't forget it. I wake up every morning and repeat: I am Madame Pujol ... I am Madame Pujol ... " Did your meeting with the German buyer go well? Success with them means entertainment I took him to dinner in Lille then to the 'Bada-Boom'. With the pretty girls... will you take me there? The 'Bada-Boom'? -Yes. Don't be ridiculous! It's not a place for you. It's not my place in the kitchen it's not my place at the 'Bada-Boom' ... Where is my place? Stop asking stupid questions. You didn't drink too much? Let me alone. You know what the doctor said. I know! You're getting more and more jumpy. It's not easy running an umbrella factory with 300 workers Every day fighting the unions, not to mention the tax department! Papa said the same thing. In his time it was a piece of cake. Fortunately I've been able to fix ... the mess he created. That's true. You brought your energy. I brought a dowry of my Papa's factory I've got to listen to the news. In the provinces strike orders have been issued by the unions. We'll go to our guest Communist MP Maurice ... Aagh! Why him? - While employers won't want to include measures favoring workers, we'll fight ... Fuck the workers! ... .. buggering up my factory... .... arsehole! [Mich?le Torr :"Take me dancing tonight."] Oh, his drops! Office of Monsieur Pujol, ...yes?. Mademoiselle Nad?ge, Madame Pujol here. Oh, hello, Madame Pujol. My husband got home late last night from the 'Bada-Boom' with the German and this morning he forgot to take his drops. So if you'd tell him to drop back home, as soon as he gets in. I couldn't do that ... You know the state he gets in when he doesn't take them Can I count on you? I'll tell him. Thanks. Goodbye. A good deed done. Good morning, sir. What else? I'd like a word with you. You already on a cigarette break? Excuse us, Monsieur Pujol. 'Morning Nad?ge. Your wife called. What does she want? "Your drops." Aagh... she pisses me off! No touching. What? What's this story about a German? I'll explain. No need. Keep that for your wife. You're not gonna make a scene. Tomorrow night ... You'll go back to the 'Bada-Boom'. It's closed on Thursdays. Mama, are you there? Joel! Hello darling. Happy birthday... I just picked it for you. Oh, thank you. How thoughtful. You're up early. I dropped the children at school. Are they well? Yes, but they're upset their father's away. Give me a hand. You've heard from him? Jean-Charles finally phoned me from Toronto. Things going well? Certainly... I think we'll separate. What? He travels all the time, we never see him. I feel he's not interested in me any more. You should go with him on his trips. And who'd look after the kids? Me. No way. You're too busy. It's me who'll take charge of the children's education. How sad... ...to separate from Jean-Charles, so soon. Yes, I know. But the idea that he's deceiving me is unbearable. You've thought about the children? No, I'm thinking about myself. Even among the most united couples, there are empty times. And then... they go away! Or don't go away. You know about that. How long 've you been sleeping apart from Papa? I don't want to talk about that. When did he last behave like a husband with you? D'you think I'd go into that! There's more to life than sex, little girl. At your age, perhaps. Your father works so hard! In the evening he's tired. Maybe he's deceiving you. I forbid you to criticize your father. I'm not criticizing him, It's you. You've just accepted everything... everything! You pretend not to see, but he does just as he wants. I've always been impervious to gossip. And then I have my grandchildren, my garden, my poems ... But are you happy, Mama? Of course I'm happy. I decided that... once and for all. But me, I don't want this pathetic life. I'd rather divorce. How are you going to live, if you divorce. I'll ask Papa for a position at the factory. That's not a bad idea. You need to know it's what you want. Me... at least, I know. The worst thing for me would be to become like you: "une potiche"... a trophy wife. Joel!!! You do it on purpose, don't you? Don't park outside the entrance! I stopped by for Mama's birthday. Who's birth... Forgot? That bitch Nad?ge forgot. She's got other things to think about think. Buy whatever you want I'll pay you back. Papa, you never change. Tonight try to be in a better mood. I need to talk to you. You know what she wants? Divorce. She's trading in Jean-Charles for someone else? No! She wants to work with her beloved father at the factory. No-way-in-the-world-and-the-kids-good... Gotta get my drops. Laurent's not here? He'll be here tonight. He's got good news for us. I'm wary of good news... ...especially concerning your son. I think he wants to get married. Great...eh? Supporting a new family ... But he's not asking you for anything. That'll come. The girl who's got her hooks into him knows what she's at. I reassure you, her family is respectable. She's the daughter of the Cathedral Square baker, Floriane Marquiset. Robert! My God! But ... Name of God, dammit! It seems she's nice. She's studied piano. She studied the piano? Would you've preferred the clarinet? It's beyond belief for him to marry Floriane Marquiset. A Pujol with a Marquiset, ..... it'd be a disgrace. You're being way too snobbish. Wait 'til you meet her. I'll never meet her. And Laurent will not marry Marquiset's daughter! You understand? If you want my opinion ... Your "opinion"? You have an opinion? All I ask of you is to share mine. Be nice, Just keep to your little poems. Joel is right. I'm just a trophy wife. I lay there in a corner ... I'm just part of the decor. Are you challenging me too? Name me one woman as indulged as you are. With regard to household appliances, I'm queen. You have everything, you have to agree. Now the phone. What a life! Hello? Oh ...can't be true! Dammit! Oh, damn! I'm coming. What's still going? I'm coming. It never stops. They're striking at workshop 4. A strike? It'll cost me millions. What'll you do? What'll I do...fight! The ... But Robert ... Be careful though. I'll go mad... A strike! A strike ... "The rose in the morning "Opens at noon "Ephemeral destiny "Died at midnight." How's Papa? Always in a bad mood with these strikes. You think it'll get better tonight? Hopefully. I'm sure he'll be charming... being my birthday. Are you happy the way your studies are going? I've had a gut-full. Political Science just isn't my thing. What is your thing? I dunno, Mama. Are you still taking drawing courses? No time... ... and what's the point? What a shame, you were gifted. I wish we had an artist in the family. You know what would make me happy? What? Come to work at the plant. Not interested in the plant. I wouldn't ever want to work with Papa. To end with the boss syndrome... hated by everyone ... Your grandfather was adored by everyone. Mama, paternalism, It's over, old-fashioned. Today's man must be a bastard, orders, unbridled capitalism. Tell me, when did you meet this Floriane? It's been six months. We met on the train when I came at Christmas. That's romantic. You're sure you're in love? Yes, Mama. She's crazy about me. So much the better. That makes for happiness. One Sunday, after Mass we stopped by her mother's bakery and got a house special... a Bombe Glac?e. I recognised the beautiful Madame Marquiset behind her counter, always so well dressed. She died electrocuted by a hairdryer. You thinking about getting married? That's what she wants. When'll we meet her? Once she's finished her exams in Paris. How nice! Grandma, look what I did for your birthday. Fabi?n, you were supposed to to wait for dessert. - Let him. It's so nice. Thank you, Fabi?n. When's Papa coming? I dunno. His schedule is very mysterious. What is it, exactly? Terrorists with machine guns. It's fun. What imagination! Grandma, I'll do an imitation of Coluche. No, Stanislaus, not that horrible Coluche here. Yet it's funny. No, it's vulgar Paris would like it. It'd do you good to travel. Your Jean-Charles never takes you anywhere? Please Laurent, not now. That's Papa. I'll get the door. He's got his key. I'm coming, Papa. I'm coming. Nad?ge? What're you doing here? I must see Madame Pujol. It's very urgent. She's is in the lounge. Mademoiselle Nad?ge? Madame, it's terrible. Terrible?... ... Papa? Yes. Monsieur Pujol ... He had an attack? No. He's locked in. Locked in? Yes. He fought with the foreman. The workers have locked him in his office. I was sure there was something... he was so on edge this morning! Do they have machine guns? Stanislaus, Flavian go upstairs. You must call the commissioner, to send a mediator. We must get the riot squad. We won't get anywhere with tear gas. These workers have got outside the law. We must act with diplomacy. Obviously. You side with the left. Beside you, everyone is left. That's enough, calm down. Mademoiselle, what do they want exactly? They require new health care. This is not too much to ask. The toilets are long-standing grievance. They're Turkish-style! It's all a political pretext. They demand everything now: Increase in staff... a Christmas bonus ... Remove surveillance. Obviously, that's a lot. It's that filthy Babin who's behind it. He stirs up revolt. You heard him on the radio? That man makes my flesh crawl. He'll be OK if he takes his drops. He always forgets. If I wasn't there ... ...rather... if you weren't there ... ....if we weren't there. Don't apologize. Well I'll go ... Where are you going? I'm his son. They can take me hostage in his place. Anyway. I appreciate this. I'm off. Come on. They're letting him go? They talked with him. It's Hubert One of the worst. I hope they'll come to an agreement. More and more are coming. They're waving banners. They wrote on the wall: "Pujol equals...oh!... Hitler." They're exaggerating. Besides the little bit on the face ... They're getting more worked up. I'm scared. Me too. Nad?ge, lock the door. Madame! Madame! They're approaching the house. Calm down. Marie Antoinette found herself in the same situation. She still finished under the guillotine. What are they shouting? Pujol ... Fed up ... Pujol, fed ... PUJOL, fed up! PUJOL, fed up! PUJOL, fed up! PUJOL, fed up! What are you doing here? A moment of relaxation. Some of the claims aren't that unjustified. Model secretary turns into rabid unionist. It won't last long. I'm not turning into anything, but salaried staff've gotta to take a stand. You don't know what's what, you're the boss's daughter. It's better than the boss's chick. I forbid you ... Who is it? I'll go. If it's the workers, don't open. Trust me. Who's there? Laurent? Already? You're not hurt, at least. Assaulting my brother! They're madmen. No, you weren't there. It wasn't the workers. papa. Papa? Robert? The workers helped me to see Papa. I tried to reason with him to make concessions. He jumped on me screaming that I was a moron. Luckily, the picket line hemmed him in. In this case, it's better I go. Mama, they'll laugh at you. I don't want your father's death on my conscience. You want me with you? No, darling. It's better I go alone. It's the boss's wife! Yes? Monsieur Deputy-Mayor, good evening. Madame Pujol? Can I come in? Yes, of course. Yes ... I'm sorry to receive you like this. I'm not here for a society event. Good...then sit down. To my left or my right. Wherever you want. What can I do for you, Madame Pujol? Monsieur Deputy-Mayor, I came to ask you to use your influence to release my husband. A dialogue needs to be opened with the union delegates. My husband refuses. I think it would be much better to negotiate in a friendly manner. "Friendly manner"? One worker was attacked! My husband is impulsive. His left fist alone? Why are you being so aggressive? I don't see why I should help you. You didn't always say that, if you know what I mean. Don't bring up the past. Would our moment of madness be incompatible with your image? Or, for that matter, with the image a perfect wife. Without you, perhaps I would be. Don't try to blame me. After all, youthful indiscretions do happen. You stinker! It was the same for you as for me. You were a girl, boss's wife and I was a worker. I betrayed my class. And I my husband. Which is worse? I remember I was returning from a wedding. Monsieur! Monsieur! I'd punctured a tire on the road. By chance we crossed paths. - It was my usual route. I'll help a neighbour even if I disagree with their politics. Hello. You should have seen the state of your dress. Hello. All stained with grease, the jack in hand. I wore a dress in organza with a pink cape. I changed your wheel and you made me smile, abandoning for a moment the arrogance of your caste. Grandpa was a boilermaker. You refused the tip I offered. But I accepted a cigarette. We went to have a smoke together, in the shade of a walnut tree. As we went into the brush. You must have thought me an easy woman. No, Suzanne. The very next day you resumed your distance and firmly drew the curtain on our adventure. I was married, a mother. I had a social status to maintain. So many times I feared you'd brag about it. I can hold my tongue when the honor of a woman is at stake. Thank you. Good. You want your husband back? Yes. But if I get his release I'll need a return match. A return match? Sir, I daren't understand.... ....at our age? No, you misunderstand. It's no longer a horny truck-driver facing you. I'm confused. Forgive me. No, forget it... In other circumstances ... Oh yes? Let's get off the subject. I'm thinking about the role you might play within the factory. Meaning...? If reforms are not applied in the immediate future, the company will be closed and 300 workers unemployed. That's a lot. Yes, Suzanne. So? What did the doctor say? I don't know. He's still with Papa. Does he know how he was released? Better not tell him. How humiliating for him! Freed by his worst enemy. If the riot squad had been on the job, we wouldn't have needed him Don't be simple. Even the communists have a heart. That's what destroys a man. His gaze wasn't the same. Don't worry, he'll recover OK. And if I made him my special broth? Why not. You need rest, darling. But it's not that serious. You're not safe from another attack, and you may have a pulmonary endema. You must spend one week in hospital for tests. But the factory? The factory...the factory... it'll fold without you? I'll leave you. Here's the prescription. Monsieur Pujol, I expect you at the hospital this week. That's it! Thank you, doctor. See you soon. Have you talked to Laurent about the Marquiset girl? Did you tell him to forget her? You don't understand...he's in love. You're forcing me to reveal something unpleasant You give me no choice. I have reason to believe Floriane is partly my daughter. What do you mean "partly your daughter"? Her mother told me. Her mother's no longer of this world ... So Madame Marquiset was your mistress? Straightaway... out come the big words! What a fine husband! Your reaction's a little late. How was I supposed to know? It's true that we were.... ....discrete. She was married. She wasn't arousing her husband's suspicions. Exactly. It's your son's fault. Of all the girls in the world, that mental defective had to go and find Mademoiselle Marquiset. This trumps the birthday gift that you forgot! You want me to beg your pardon? No. You disgust me. Under these circumstances, you'll agree that marriage is unthinkable. They're already sleeping together. Omigod! Your banging the Marquiset woman won't get you into heaven. Why, f'Godsake? It's so long ago. But because ... it's the straw that broke the trophy wife's back! Is everything OK, ma'am? Yes, OK. I made my special broth. That's nice. It'll do him good. Cuckoo! What are you doing here? I'm here I'm here to give you my little specialty. Yes. That can't hurt me. I was talking about my special broth. Mademoiselle Nad?ge is really a model secretary. She made some broth for your father. She'll get it in her face. He's here. Have him come in. Who? The one who freed your father. That man here? It is you who ... - That's me. But it's the devil! Hello. Welcome, Monsieur Deputy. And thank you again. The union delegates feel they have taken the first step. They require an immediate response. It's just that my husband isn't well this morning. Tomorrow he may receive visits. You don't give a damn about me? It's the truth... True, he's very weak. You want a certificate? I've done my part of the bargain. If I plead his case, it's up to the workers to decide. So in the absence of negotiations, I predict a restoration of the strike. As for me, I'll predict my foot up your arse! Monsieur Pujol! He doesn't look sick. What are you doing to me? Isn't enough having humiliated me? Come off it, Papa ... Shut up, arsehole! Papa, be reasonable. You'll strain your heart. What have you done to me? I only promised Monsieur the Deputy-Mayor that in exchange for your release you'd consider some requests ...about staff. That I'm for. Me too. For the brainwashing ... Robert, you do nothing but fight. You've got to negotiate. Tell the delegates that if they want paid holidays, they've got to return to work. If they want to earn more, it'll require more work. You thought I was finished, washed up. My family was ready to sell off the factory. Once the picket lines are removed, I'll show you what a boss is who has two of them! - Let me tell you the Works has decided to review your accounts. Whadda you mean? That your Mercedes is listed as a company car. Your apartment, your servants, your home, your boat, made out to be company expenses. Papa! Heart attack, as I predicted. Raise his head. Press firmly. My father... a heart-attack. Send an ambulance. This is where is anger leads to. He'll go to hospital now. What about the factory? Your father should be replaced by someone with power of attorney. He transferred it. In this case ... No. Sorry. The management of a factory, Not for me. Me? She's worse than Papa. But then who? Jean-Charles. Oh no, not him. Why not you, Madame Pujol? You're joking? It'd be above board. The founder's daughter, the boss's wife. But I don't know anything about it. You won't really be Plant Manager. Just sit in Papa's chair. You won't be given any responsibilities. Still, I don't know if I ... Suzanne, do what you're told. Do what you're told. Better you than someone else. We've no choice. If it's you who's asking me ... I'ill do nothing to cause you concern. That's the way. So you agree? In the interest of the factory, yes. It's okay, I'll be fine. I'm trusting on you to keep me posted. Count on me, boss. Should I take your place, Madame Pujal? Yes. You do that very well. No, Nad?ge. I'm going with Papa. It would have been easier if you'd been successor to your father. You're going with history. Women everywhere are taking power. Go, go home. You have to speak to Monsieur Babin. In what state of mind will you meet the committee? Conciliation. Provided they don't ask for too much. When the workers demand too much, it's that the boss doesn't give enough. Good. We must prepare a little script, so what you say'll be without stuttering. That's a good idea. Me, I'd start with: "Gentlemen, I come to you in a spirit of understanding ... " "Gentlemen"? It's cold, it's snobbish. I 'd say "my friends". I wouldn't recommend that. These aren't your friends. Maybe they'll become so. That'd take action, not empty words. Good. Go on. "In a spirit of understanding. "I am just a woman, but ... " I can't say that. It's obvious, isn't it? I don't apologize for being a woman. It's not that ... You're a misogynist. We support women's rights. I can't say "I am a woman." I'll say: "Yes, I am a woman." Because whether you like it or not, I'm a woman. But I like it. I like it very much, Suzanne. They're waiting for you. Already? If we want work to resume, let's go. How do they seem? Not very prepossessing. The less they're kept waiting, the better it'll be. I'd like to get myself ready. You're fine. I know what I am. They can wait. No, really. Does the factory say anything to you? Should it? When you had the luck to be your father's son and when you've done Political Science ... I'm "my father's son? You are the Pujol son. It doesn't interest me, all that. The money, possessions, benefits. I'm against the exploitation of man. Have you told your father that? Sort of. What'd he say? I'd be eaten by others. Typical! Politically...are you engaged? Politics, protests, mean very little for me. Everything is political commitment. Don't wear yourself out. What interests you? You really want to know? Yes. Painting, art history, Kandinsky ... Ah yes! Kandinsky, yes. He was a true revolutionary. You see that do you care about politics. Che Guevara, Georges Marchais, Kandinsky ... The politics of art. I enjoy interacting ideas with youth. We should have a drink, one day, together. Yes. What's that? It's not like you? It's not too much, Mama? But why? You won't present yourslf to the factory in this outfit! It's a provocation. But I wanted to honor the workers. And I put on all my jewelery. Just for them... they deserve it. Let's hope they enjoy them. Let's go. It's the dress you ... Did you recognize it? I hadn't forgotten. The committee's in the union meeting-room. I've got stage fright. I'll leave you... ...Miss Nad?ge will accompany you. You're abandoning me? The committee'd take a dim view... I'm involved in the meeting. Are you sure? It's OK... go on. Call me when you're done. It's gonna be alright. You won't leave me, will you? No, madame. Is my dress too much? No, no. That's fine. Those men will be in for an eyeful. How many are there? Ten, I think. Hope they're nice. Gentlemen. Good morning, gentlemen. Hello Madame Pujol. Sit down, guys. My dear friends, as you know, my husband was hospitalized. I'm standing in for him until the end of his convalescence. I am delighted to meet you to get acquainted, so we can chat ... As you are aware, your husband is precipitating the factory into a catastrophic situation. If we're on strike today, it's not for fun. We love our work. We're fed up I can here you quite well, Andr? ... No need to get so angry. Moreover, I'm pleased to see the progress you've made. My father who took you on as an apprentice 'd be proud to know you're still here. So what are your concerns, my friend? Madame Pujol I'll be very clear. We will not resume work until the following claims have been implemented. 1. Award of the Christmas bonus to all employees effective retroactively January 1. 2. The fifth week of paid leave. 3. Reorganization of working time and standardization of 40 hours with extra hours additional 25% pursuant to Article 1 ... As Papa said: "There is no need "To load the mule for it to reach its destination. " In any case, I agree with you. Things aren't good here any more. It's time we once again had the desire to work in fraternity and solidarity. Concretely, what does that mean? I swear on the heads my children and my father to examine your demands with the most sincere attention to improve the situation in our factory. As you know, I am the wife of Monsieur Pujol. So he's my boss too. So I can understand you. Except that I'm not about to strike. Congratulations, boss. - Mama? Mama? So? How did it go? They go back to work tomorrow. That's great! I knew you could do it. So you've given in on everything? No. We negotiated. You know, I really thought about the situation. I want to ask a sacrifice of you both. I want you to be at my side. We are at your side, Mama. To work with me. Joel, I want to propose you help me with the management. At the factory, with you? I know you want to work with your father. I'm making the proposal. Thank you, Mama! You gonna mess my hair! And I'm going out tonight. I'm sure it will make things better between you and Jean-Charles. And I'll do what? I've got my Political Science classes. The experience 'd be good for you. It doesn't interest me. We'll find you an artistic position. And Floriane in Paris? I can't leave her. I'd forgotten about that. On weekends, we'll have concerts at the factory. Music doesn't do any harm, especially to the workers. So... to us! To the Pujol-Michonneau factory. To the Pujol-Michonneau factory! [Baccara: "Do you speak French?"] Who's the bourgeois bimbo with the yokel? Hey! Isn't it that woman at Pujol's ...right? Pujol? Our Pujol? What are you smiling at? Imagine Robert's face if he saw me here, and with you. The poor man. Thank you for your help at the factory. I couldn't have done it alone. It was nothing. You know what surprises me the most? No. Is to celebrate the end of the strike, here with you, at the 'Bada-Boom'. I know this isn't my sort of place, but I've dreamt of coming. He brings his clients here. Tonight, Suzanne I'm the one who's your client. [Once Upon a Time: "Come take a walk in the rain."] Thank you. Forgiveness. Couldn't we start again from scratch? Alas ... You're the woman of my life Suzanne. And if we had our life together? It's impossible. You're forgetting about your mistress. Who told you about that? That was a dirty trick. It is called 'politics'... a demanding rival. You know, Suzanne, the old activist in me begins to falter. This revolution I've fought for... ...I sometimes wonder if I'll ever see it. I'm still fighting so generations to come 'll know a better world. But I've a right to happiness, haven't I?. Would you get it from me? I've got a heavy name to wear: Michonneau-Pujol. But you'll change. How will you introduce me? Comrade Suzanne? I can already hear the jeers. I'll explain to them. That you also love justice. You'll share our beliefs. We'll see a brighter future... together. . You'll lose your mayoral sash and your seat as a deputy. And I'm a married woman. But you no longer love that man. After so much time together, links get forged, invisible... but solid. Of you two, it's Robert who needs me most. Oh, Suzanne! I'm losing you again. But no, no. We can go on seeing each other.... ....go out together, dine face to face.... stay good friends. That's reasonable. It's our age. Oh, Suzanne! Maurice ... Suzanne! The demand for umbrellas in India is up 14% per year. By increasing our sales by 25% we'd get ... 43.70% of the market. Exactly. Not to mention the climate forecasts which predict an increase in rain. Where it falls, there we are! So if I count one umbrella for every two households, knowing that there are 110 million people that's ... 22 million brollies. Yes, 22 million. It would be a big market. The Japanese are already established. Set all that out clearly for me and do me a summary for the sales manager. And for my daughter too. Ah? Okay. What time does my husband arrive? Ten past eleven. Make sure I don't have any appointments. What's Laurent going to show us? Good morning, madame. Hello, darling. Good morning, my friends. Good morning Madame Pujol. How are you all? Very well. Call me Suzanne. So? We've finished the sketches for the new collection which could be called The Rainbow Collection. What a lovely idea! One, two, three. Oh! This one's very pretty. I love these colours. What d'you think, Nad?ge? A bit garish. But it's the fashion. It's so original. Look, Maman. A surprise. The Kandinsky line. Oh! It's daring. That's the high end. At the same time revolutionary. With acknowlegements to Monsieur Babin. On another tack, we've begun sketching for the waxed line But we haven't got far yet. Your father 'll be happy and proud of your initiatives. Hopefully. They are amazing. It surprised me, anyway. Mama, can I talk to you? Can it wait till this afternoon? I want to see you before Papa arrives. Madame Pujol's office. I'll be there in 5 minutes. You're not expected 'til tomorrow. Yes, yes. Okay, I'm coming. I have a report that Jean-Charles did for me that's absolutely wonderful. Feeling better with him! I told you so. This report gives us ideas on the future of the factory. Among other things, reduce staff and relocation to Tunisia to increase our profits by 35%. Can you imagine? I'll read it tonight. Have you had any results? Yes. I hope I'm not pregnant again. You told me ... Are you sure it's his? What do you take me for? Excuse me. You should thank Jean-Charles, But the priority, is to restore a harmonious social climate within the factory. But we must also look ahead and modernize. But modernise without layoffs. When'll you stop listening to your communist? The deputy mayor has nothing to do with my management of the plant. I happened to see him and he was opposed to my initiatives. Then read this report. I'll read it... I promise. I remember how my papa was loved by his workers. He led the plant for over 40 years and never a single day stop working, even in 1936. Workers retiring, were given slippers, an numbered umbrella and his autographed photo. Alas, now we're in 1977. I haven't forgotten. Hello, Monsieur Pujol. Hello, Nad?ge. How are you? Very good. I've missed you. Me too, Robert. One second, please. I have something to ask you. About the problem of structure... the first stand ... Ah, you do it for me. - Stop. They might surprise us. They're eating. No. There was a meeting in the boardroom on new development strategies. "Development"? My arse...yes! Why you haven't you told me about this? And my mail? A postcard! I didn't have my favorite little secretary in my bag. Enough of this now! Aren't you happy to see me? Not like this. I am no longer the same. What are you doing, Nad?ge? I changed. I am a new woman thanks to the woman in charge. You're having it off with her too? She, she respects me. Come and finish what we started. I'm aroused! I've made my decision. If we're to continue you've got to leave your wife for me. Leave Suzanne? You're mad? I've always cheated. It suits her. I don't want to live in the shade. I won't be tropohy wife number 2. Nad?ge! Suzanne! You're back? Just got in. I wanted to celebrate your return. I wanted to give you a surprise. And I brought a gift from Greece for the umbrella queen . You thought of me? You've changed the decor? I added a little color. It's beautiful! I knew it would please you. You're spoiled, Madame Pujol. He's not mean to me. Are they real diamonds? Here, I thought of you too. Really? Turkish delight? Turkish delight? I love it. Thanks from my diet. Leave us please, Nad?ge. Very good. If you can assist a man in trouble without becoming skeptical as to his quality, if you know how to be beautiful without being boring, if you can be strong without being impatient experienced without ageing, friendly and smiling even to a savage if you know how to type, shorthand, phone, if you can give birth during lunchtime then better than architect, engineer or minister, forever protected by the peaks where it shines, thou shalt be secretary, my daughter. She's completely crazy. But no. Me, I like her. You saw her new hairstyle? No. Give her a compliment. You know me ... You could force yourself. I can't put a finger on it, I don't know what you've done, but I think you're better than before. Kiss me? I am your husband. You'll have spent 30 years keeping that in mind. Like when I was pissed off during the cruise. But it was good for you. You're fit, tanned ... I've got energy to spare. Holidays over for the guys too. What holidays? Last 3 months at the factory. It hasn't been a holiday. We even caught up with the strike days. No kidding! You received the reports? Absolutely. You've looked after everything I was concerned about. No, Robert, I assure you. After the bad times things have gone well, and even very well. Still, after a strike. You sat in my chair, you put on your innocent air, you've generously accepted all the changes... You've been remarkable. The "Madame CEO" plaque will come off the door and Madame will return to her domestic activities. I'm afraid not, Robert. Who's the boss here, for God's sake? Me. An brief analysis of the situation..... I represent an employer with a smile, fair, warm. I even managed to persuade your children to join the factory. Why I should leave? I have majority control of the shares, you poor boob. Do you? I checked things out during your cruise. Papa left me 15% of the shares. My sister inherited some. Add to that the 20% of Laurent and Joel, more small shareholders. In total, I've got 55% under my belt. You don't even have that 45%. Suzanne! But I'll defend your interests like a lioness! You'll be able to live for yourself! Golf, fishing, hunting, bridge ... You won't miss anything! So that's me now, the trophy wife? Sort of. But you'll soon get the hang of it. Come in. Papa? You're back? Hello. That sounds like you're going. Your tricks won't work. I haven't had the last word. Laurent has had nothing to do with all this. He runs the design department of Pujol umbrellas ... I don't give a fuck! I want my place back! He's done a great job... remarkable! Forget it, Maman... papa won't change. I'll miss my train. Don't be late on our account. Hi to Floriane and kisses from me. Hang in there. "Floriane"? The Marquiset girl. He'll see her in Paris. They seem to get along wonderfully. You're crazy. You've forgotten what I told you? It still gives me a pain in the gut. They can no longer see each other. They're brother and sister. You don't say! You're so respectable! It bores me to tell it like that ... Don't get angry. Go ahead, speak. Laurent and Floriane can marry with impunity. But I'm telling you ... They are not brother and sister. Huh? Think about it! No! Laurent ... Yes. You're lying. I'll have to go. Put yourself in my shoes. I was young, quite cute completely neglected by an unfaithful husband. I am avenged. I regret nothing. And I fixed your mistake. Who...who've you deceived me with? There are limits.... Just calm down. My factory, my wife, my son ... It's the end of the lunch break. It was good to see you again. We still have things to discuss. I must get back to work. There's a quiche for you in the fridge. I'm not hungry. Come on, don't sulk. I put the TV in your bedroom. In the afternoon? You can watch "Madame Today." Women's work, you are for it? It gives an impression of equality with men. The husband should earn enough money so his wife could stay at home. It's our job. This is not a bad idea. It brings money. She may not have a salary like yours? It should fullfill them. If they stay at home After this break. Oh, Joel! My darling! I'm glad to see you. My! you're beautiful. It seems you work at the plant. Mama trusts me. More reproaches! You're all against me? But no. We missed you. I'm flattened, Joel. Your mother's finished me off. I know She's become another woman. With her it's all about "Participation" and "Self-Management." Jean-Charles is very concerned about the future of the factory. But she got things through that Babin refused you. Yes... that's it, it's Babin. She's his toy. He manipulates. He's humping her? Oh, Daddy! I'd rather not know. In my opinion, it's a not new situation I found this. The bitch! So it was him. "Him" What? She'll pay for this. Hello. I want to talk Monsieur Babin. You have an appointment? I'm Monsieur Pujol. Robert Pujol. Monsieur Babin, hello. Monsieur Pujol is back. Back, yes. And I need your help. I have a report on measures planned by my wife. To undo anything you did. What have I done? The wildcat strike, my confinement, all that has been conducted masterfully. Then you arrange to make the report public about who wants to reduce staff and relocate. I will not tell you your job, Babin. And I want my job. Better you convince your board. Especially your workers. You are a mass manipulator Babin. And with money to put on the table ... D'you take me for a clown who favors employers? You're a two-faced man my dear. What do you imply? What were you doing with my wife at the Bada-Boom? What? Don't make out innocent. And expect more. You were seen with Madame Pujol in the cafeteria of the Sofitel. We met to talk about working conditions at the factory. With all those precautions to not be recognized? We wanted to avoid talk. What would your constituents and the Central Committee do if they found in the local rag a photo of incorruptible member trying to break out the champagne with Madame Pujol. Why create a scandal that will explode in everyone's face?? Why? Because I am a man betrayed and I don't care about the scandal. Listen, Nothing has happened between your wife and me. And 25 years ago? - My God! That's me. Suzanne loves me, then. It may cost you if I reveal that your adventure produced a brat, my son Laurent. Laurent? Your son? My son? Alas, yes. You sure? Oh, I wasn't there, was I? Life is strange. We believe ourselves a hardened old fighter... and find we're a young papa. Your blackmailing has made me the happiest of men. Anyway, if you don't organise this strike for me, Your career is shattered. Yes. Yes, Pujol. Our main competitors, the Chinese. are very interested ... Madame Pujol? My mother's doing an interview. It makes me happy to see you. Me too. What youth, what enthusiasm! Are you alright, Mr. Babin? That hair, that smile, the look ... Monsieur Deputy-Mayor? Would you tell them how the region is proud to have a woman like me ... I won't be part of your personality worship. Excuse him, he's a communist. It makes me happy see you, you. Me too ... I'm all yours. Could we see her alone? Let's go to my office. I'd rather do it in my car. In your car? It's uncomfortable. Follow me. You'll look after these gentlemen? Yes. Be careful. Babin's a bit weird. Yes, I'm coming, coming. Your husband came to see me. Is it true, Suzanne that your son is mine? That my son is not his. Is this gossip behind my back.... What is this nonsense... The truth. Tell me the truth. One word can make me the happiest of men. Is Laurent my son? I'd wish you that pleasure, Monsieur deputy mayor...but... If we look at the dates ... my photo in your locket. You've got my medallion? I have been looking for months. Your husband nicked it from you. Tell me, ....Laurent?. No, Maurice, It's not you. Really? So...finally, he's Pujol's. No. He's neither yours nor his. Whose is he then? I've every reason to believe he's the son of Monsieur Balestra. The notary? He was a clerk at the time. Hard to understand when you see him today. I was often in his study discussing Papa's estate. He was young, charming. In his office there was this big leather sofa. Everything suggests that Laurent is the son of Monsieur Balestra. Although, if I were to rely only on appearances, he's the image of Gunnar, this cheerful Swede who gave tennis lessons for children, a tall blond... pretty hefty. There've been many? No... no others in May '52. Poor Pujol married a bourgeois nymphomaniac. You can't judge me by my youthful indescretions. You've benefited. I'd put you on a pedestal. I happened to come down. I've only had brief adventures. That's ancient history. I've other concerns now. Exactly... what's this here? This is the report by Jean-Charles. I really must read it. She'll be angry. You think I'm going to believe that? I'm a man killed twice over, Suzanne. After the revelations of your husband I thought, as in a dream I'd become a father and your companion. How could I have fooled myself so much? You never stopped being just the same: 'Wifey', locked up in his world of lies. And I thought to myself... a tryst, in memory of our meeting! Serves me right. I beg you kindly get out of my car. The factory's over 5 kilometres And I've got high heels. This is where our journey ends. Farewell, Suzanne. Goodbye. Hey! Thank you, sir. You've saved my life. How am I going to go? Oops, my skirt! You travel this way often? It happens. Why? It's pretty, isn't it? Very pretty. NO TO OUTSOURCING! NO TO OUTSOURCING! Madame Pujol promised continual dialogue. It's always the same. We trust the bosses, and then before long... go whistle for it! I condemn the pernicious use of this report which I strongly condemn and do not want to use. Grandma's beautiful. Many believed in her. She continues the politics of her husband. We must return to a report supported by the unions. I met the Board of Directors to find a solution. Hah! Don't worry, Mama. Everyone supports you. So why the strike? It's the principle. Your father's got shareholders against me. I reassure you, they'll be on our side. Fortunately you're there. How'd I have got by without my son? Thank you, Laurent. This is normal. Poor Floriane, I've kept you from her. I've learned a lot from you. How do I look? You're perfect, as usual. So let's go. Hello, my friends. Following the incidents caused by the publication of this report, that I've been accused of commissioning, a meeting of this Board has been called. I hope we can discuss this in a fraternal spirit. Monsieur Pujol, you wish to speak? Yes, Madame Chair. I would like in these circumstances of crisis to propose a vote at the meeting: For or against the continuation of your plant management, madame, knowing that I am prepared to take over the reins as soon as possible. Things are clear. The situation calls for some urgency. Good. To a vote then. Mademoiselle Nad?ge, would you record the votes? Naturally. Starting on my left. Do you think I should direct the factory management? Yes, Mama. I'll give my 10%. On top of my my 15% that's 25%. Mademoiselle Genevieve Micheneau? I'll keep my confidence in you, Suzanne and I give you my 15%. Thank you, my dear sister. Monsieur Pujol? I vote against your direction. It's 45%. Okay. Gentlemen? Despite the destabilization you have suffered, we recognize the value your work in recent months. And then, we submit our 5%. Madame Pujol, 45 per cent. Monsieur Pujol 45 per cent. Leaving only my daughter, Joelle, whom I have wisely advised and assisted during these last few months. I give my 10% ... To Robert Pujol, my father. Thank you, my daughter. The bitch! What a bitch! Laurent, you have a moment? I have very important things to say to you. We have nothing to say. I'm going. Listen, Laurent I'm getting older and tireder and I'm not in great shape. I put my energy and passion in developing this factory. I know that during my absence You have been remarkable. I want you to work here, to one day take over my estate. If you're trying to soften me up. It's too late. It is never too late. Especially after what you just did. I've only reclaimed my position to make it better for you. Your methods disgust me. You'll do anything, even crush your own wife. He's warped you! That Babin. Monsieur Babin has nothing to do with this. Much more than you think. So you agree to remain at the plant to work with your father? My father? When you have been a father for me? To think that's it's thanks to me that you're here. I let you have a strategic position. That is how you thank me. What ingratitude! Papa would've offered me the same position. You're very naive my daughter. If you knew what he said when I asked him to involve you. Don't be cruel. But allow me to regret your lack of female solidarity. There is no solidarity, but of competence. You're your father's daughter. He's happy to use Jean-Charles' report. I beg you, Mama don't get angry. When you made me out to be a dummy who accepted everything! But you were happy about it. That's what I thought. What are you going to do? What you don't dare to do: Divorce. You can't do that. So your mother's to stay as the servant-trophy-wife? I'm entitled to my freedom. But why ... Why should I fight you when I'm your mother? You want the truth, Mama? Sure. I voted against you because of Jean-Charles. What d'you mean? Papa promised to give him my position for the 10%. You'll give up your position? Yes. That way, Jean-Charles will stop travelling and stay here with me. I'm no longer able to live alone. I'm pregnant, Mama. I'm going on maternity leave and I'll leave my job. It is monstrous. You don't have to sacrifice yourself, and your work, for your husband. And the pill does exist. Abortion, too, today. Jean-Charles is against it. But it's your body, darling. It's up to you. I made my decision, Mama. I want to keep this child. Very good. I can only rejoice for you. I ask one thing: Don't get divorced. Papa wouldn't support it and me neither. Some months later What are you doing? Nothing. Oh, the little rascals. Jean-Charles assured me that labor's good in Tunisia . There may be workers for almost nothing. We think it'd be a good idea. Suzanne, don't forget to call the Prefect... ....Christmas for the kids at the factory. I'll ask Mademoiselle Nad?ge. I'll be busy for the next few days. What do you have to do? Haven't I told you? I am running for election on an anti-Babin platform. Are you crazy? No. Just a woman of the 80s. Mama, we're still in 1978. You've knocked me for living in the past. Now I'm taking the lead! Hello, monsieur. I'm Suzanne Pujol. Delighted. I am running for election. When I was little, my father took us to a farm. There was one called Rose. "Rose"? I have one called Plum and the other Falbala. "Falbala"? Is that fermented milk? It's milk that's at 37 degrees that we mix it with rennet, and it's is drained. Then you put them ... That's it. Chabichou cheese with nettles. It is a kind of Saint-Paulin. If I'm elected, I'll support it at the National Assembly. We really need it. To you, to us! Chabichou, it's crazy. In Chabrechou! Wait. I'm your candidate. Look, miss. Thank you. Hello, Laurent. Vote for me. Madame Pujol I'm glad to see you. Nad?ge, how are you? Oh, it's difficult. Everything is back as before. Vote for me. I will improve things. I intend to do. I wanted to tell you one thing. What you're doing... it amazes me. Thank you, Nad?ge. I see that a woman can succeed without a man. I'm Madame Pujol. I'm running for election. I'm for reconciliation and well-being. I'm an independent. You spoke to the priest? Yes. He'll vote for us. That's good. He's very influential. That's true. Do I finally get to meet Floriane? No. She's not here. She doesn't come on weekends? It's...over. My God! You told me nothing. Not because of me, I hope. In a way. You're the the most important woman in my life. You're exaggerating. I'm just your maman. You haven't introduced me to that nice young man who helps us produce the leaflets. It's Jean-Fran?ois. He just came along and offered to help. He adores you too. I can understand why people vote for us seeing this handsome boy. You have a family resemblance. He's Monsieur Balestra the notary's son . Your father will be pleased. About what? That you've broken up with Floriane... His snobbishness about his son with a pastrycook ... Here, Jacqueline. March 12, Vote for Madame Pujol. You never go out, but there, it's worth it. Ah, Nad?ge. Hello. Going OK? You want to get rid of Babin? Now's the time. Vote Babin. March 12. Your father, okay? Have him come March 12. Hello. Feeling well? Remember March 12, vote Babin. Very good cheese. March 12, at the polls. Thank you. Hello to your wife. What's this? Ah, that Pujol woman. Pass out leaflets, the leaflets! Babin ...Vote Babin! Hello, sir. I consider everyone. She's had a facelift. She had to go on a diet. Hello. Hello, Madame Pujol. Hello. Good luck. Madame Pujol, you recognize me? No. I worked 40 years for your dad. He loved me very much. Oh yeah? You know, I had 11 children. 11 children! They've all worked at the factory. Thank you for what you did for me and my family. But it's nothing. Goodbye. March 12. I'm counting on you. Vote Suzanne Pujol. Is that you, bitch, spreading propaganda in my factory? I'd never do such a thing... to go against your interests! If I find out that you're the eye of Moscow you'll be fired. The tribunal will be delighted to accept my secrets about the factory's operations. I'm not disturbing you, Suzanne? No. I'm finishing reading this report. It's crazy: They want to scrap the Saint-Amand-les-Eaux road Can I sleep with you? What's got into you? Listen, I'm still working... ...and you and I are divorcing. It will complicate things. You're such a pet. Why don't you go to the 'Bada-Boom'? It's closed on Thursdays. Just a kiss, then go to sleep. What are you thinking? About us. An old story. No. Remember our honeymoon? I remember a wild beach in the depths of Brittany. It was a deserted cove. The sun was setting. The sea was cool. She seemed so hot in your arms. It seemed so blue in your eyes. We were young, beautiful, heedless. We loved each other. Why divorce after all these years? What's the point? So you'll look at me differently. I do look at you differently. Tell me something, Robert? Will you vote for me? Jo?lle Hersant. Voted. Hubert Barbin. Voted. Madame Pilar Sanchez. Voted. Madame Gilberte Pacot. Andr? Ferron. Voted. Monsieur Babin! So how did it go? Maurice Babin. Voted. Monsieur Babin what are your predictions? Listen, I'm confident. Genevi?ve Michonneau. Mademoiselle Dumoulin Nad?ge. Robert Pujol. Voted. Going well? Yes. An upset. An upset? Madame Joelle Pujol de Morette. Voted. I hope that you will win. Thank you. Hello, Madame Pujol. Hello. Suzanne Pujol. Voted. Your predictions? No comment. Final results are in, mother. Leave me alone for a moment? Sure. Hello? Good evening, Madame Pujol. You've got the result? Yes Why? You've not stuffed the ballot boxes. Seriously, you're not too disappointed? Not as much as your husband. You think so? Your real opponent it was not me but him. Maybe. We can stay friends? Your new position 'll make us meet often. Of course Mostly face-to-face. I look forward to it. Maman, people are beginning to arrive. Excuse me, I must go. See you soon, Madame Deputy. Very soon, Monsieur Le ... ...Monsieur Mayor. Please. Good evening, everybody. Thank you for being here. I ask you kindly welcome our new parliamentary deputy, Suzanne Pujol! Good evening. SUZANNE! SUZANNE! SUZANNE! My friends, let me first thank you for electing me in the first round. I also want to offer, in all fraternity ... We won! We won! Yes, we won. I also want to offer in all brotherhood all my respect to our mayor, Maurice Babin and all my friends too. In this moving victory night I can only have but an emotional thought for my father who would have been so proud of his daughter. And it is in his memory I solemnly declare that I want me, Suzanne Pujol born a Michonneau, to continue Papa's work, as a benefactor of this city. She's divorced the boss? No. I do not care. She's my boss. She offered me the job as her parliamentary assistant... I'm going to Paris! My dream today on becoming your Deputy would be to open a huge umbrella and keep you close to me, to shelter you, to pamper you. Because you are all children, my children. Maman! Maman! Maman! Maman! Maman! Maman! That's what I want to be for you: A mother! For 30 years, I was content to keep house for Monsieur Pujol. A few months were enough to put his factory in order. So... so why not try with France? After centuries of oppression and slavery, women must regain power. It's time to return to the age of matriarchy and blessed time of the Amazons. And I took Mama for a trophy wife. If she was, she wasn't a stupid one. Subtitles: FatPlank / RLB
