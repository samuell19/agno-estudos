The Iga clan was almost destroyed... ...by General Hideyoshi's army. Gohei! Juzo! We are finished. There's no way out! Idiot! Death is shame for the Iga clan. Then, what are you going to do? We've got to get away and survive. How about our families? For example, your daughter? I will carry her. Let those who can't run, surrender. Leave them to the enemy's mercy. I will survive! Ayuri, my sister! What happened, Kuroami? What happened to our parents? Tell me! Hideyoshi's men... ...hacked them to death. What! Ayuri! And they violated me... Many of them... Take revenge... please! Ayuri! It's not like you to grieve so much... ...over your family's death. Murdered are my family, not yours. Don't talk like that. Did you forget your training? I told you to be like a stone, unbreakable. I told you we should not have human sentiments. I forgot it. I'm not ashamed of having forgotten it. I am living. Humans know sorrow. And what the living do for the dead is vengeance! Damn Hideyoshi! He will see the revenge of the Iga clan! Ten years later, Lord Oda was killed by a traitor. Hideyoshi has seized power. Kizaru, wait here. Juzo, come down! Kuroami, you too. Master! Juzo, you haven't changed. Kizaru? How big you have grown! Master, what happened to Gohei? He was engaged to her. He left for Kyoto three years ago. Maybe he left our clan. Then he shall die. Whoever deserts Iga dies. I will get him myself! Juzo... Still after Hideyoshi? Yes, but I failed five times. He has got luck. You are persistent. Why not get paid for your vengeance on Hideyoshi? Paid? I would like to. Who is going to pay? Imai, the trader of Sakai. When can I see him? At Tofuku-ji Temple, at midnight in two days. Good. Sir Juzo Tsuzura, I am your guide. You, woman? Call me Kohagi. What are you to Imai? What do you think? Please follow me. Stop joking. A well trained woman! What do you mean? I am an ordinary woman. Imai employs a strange one. Let us go. Wait in there. And you? My job is over. Do you steal? Who are you? I'm invited here. Ah, the Iga man? I'm Kurando, leader of Shibata Warriors. I have been waiting for you. Kurando, no kidding... You don't look like a warrior. What? Relax. And you? I'm Kumotaro, an ex-fisherman. But I am strong. I like your honesty. Juzo is beyond these men. He will suspect you. I just want to see how he makes out. - Constables! - What? How did they know? I don't know. Your fault. Don't talk that way. I command here. I won't work under an unreliable man. How dare you say that! How skillful! You are under arrest! Mr. Imai! I'm sent by Jiroza of Iga. I expected you. I heard you killed Kurando. Did the woman Kohagi tell you? She is my adopted daughter. Adopted? She lives in my Kyoto villa, so you can contact her. Is it your way to begin your work by killing a friend? I will make tea for you. Come in. Just like late Lord Oda... You know how to enjoy tea without ceremony. Hideyoshi can't do that. He seems open-minded but actually he isn't. I understand. His silly idea of a Korea invasion... ...will destroy our trade relations with other countries. My business will be ruined. I want him dead before he sends his army to Korea. Kill him? His death will cause an all-out war for power. That's what I want. I make money in wars. Is that all? Who is behind you? I bet it is Lord Tokugawa Ieyasu from Mikawa. Iga spy, shut your mouth! You get mad when you hear the truth. It's been a long time, Kizaru. Gohei, I am questioning you for my father. You could at least greet me. Enough! Gohei, you broke the Iga code! You hated the life in our clan. That's right. You have been away. Do you serve a local lord now? Answer me! Kizaru, we are engaged to each other. Do you remember? Why did you leave me then? I will cancel the engagement. What are you doing? Kizaru! Fool! What are you doing? A marriage act. So you are my wife. You must obey your husband! KYOTO GOVERNOR'S OFFICE Where are you from? I am from Tosa. My family has a long history there. You can't deceive me. I'm not blind. You are Gohei Kazama from Iga, aren't you? Why did you serve me? For what purpose? I had enough of the order. I envy the samurai who could work his way up. That's all. But since I'm discovered... ...I'm ready for any punishment. Good, you are promoted to a 300-koku samurai. Understand? Thank you! You are no longer an Iga man. You have no more obligation whatsoever to Iga. Yes, my lord! Tell me now... I hear the Iga remnants are gathering somewhere... ...for some unknown purpose. Do you know? I can guess. I think they were hired to assassinate Lord Hideyoshi. Is there any proof of that? No, my lord. That's only my sixth sense. I can also sense a spy hiding there. Judging from the breath, it's a Koga man. I'm sure he is a master with the title of Mari. Come out! I'm Mari Dogen of Koga. You are very good, Gohei. My lord, wasn't I right? If so, who is behind the plot? None but Lord Tokugawa Ieyasu. But accusing him would mean a civil war. We should avoid it at this time. Who, do you think, is assigned to assassinate Lord Hideyoshi? Juzo Tsuzura is the only one but me in Iga... ...who is capable of the job. Good. You capture him. We will execute him so Lord Tokugawa will be alarmed. We are twenty strong now. Good. Divide this money among you equally. We will get Hideyoshi on his return. At Fushimi Castle. In the meantime, stir up trouble in town. I will check the Castle. All right, we are going. I bet you are a Koga. Why do you attack me? - Oh, you? - To get even. I admit, you are beyond me, Sir Juzo Tsuzura. I felt you really meant to kill me. Yes, I meant to, if you were so weak. Even now... What? I want to hurt you and see you bleed. And then I will tend to you. It's a riddle. I don't understand my sentiment myself. You are Mimi of Iga, aren't you? Yes, I am. What have you been doing? I beg for a living. In this age of peace, what else could I do? You have lost the Iga spirit, haven't you? Never! Try me. Then, stab your hand. You are hopeless! Wait! I will try. All right? Pull it slowly. Not so quick! Stop! - Will you hire me? - No! What? You have become a coward! An Iga man shouldn't utter a moan... ...even if he is stabbed and hacked! This is for the pain. Damn it! I won't forget this! Beggar! "Meet me at midnight tomorrow at Kurodani. Juzo." It's been ten years, Gohei. Yes, since the siege. I really missed you. Tell me why you became an official. I hated life in Iga. Now I get 300 koku for capturing you. Fine destiny! It's burning out. A meteor? Your life. You are losing it for only 300 koku. Don't be silly! This is only temporary. I will work my way up to even lordship. If you get me? I will be rewarded 2,000 koku. What a pity! Then I will kill you before being caught. It won't be easy. I know. Gohei, why not return to the free life of an Iga ninja? You are too good for being an employee. Cut it out. I want success in life. First I will disclose your plot for my promotion. I will close my eyes for tonight. From tomorrow on, I will chase you to the end as an official. I will come for your head before then. Remember that. Fool! Kizaru! Juzo! Have you killed Gohei? Shall I tell you where he is? I know that. You kill him if you want to. Follow her. Why follow me, kid? Don't be rude! I am a grown up man. Don't you know me? I am Kumotaro. Pity, I don't. Well, from this day on, remember me. Well, why are you following me? Because I have fallen for you! I'm crazy about you! Stop it! Gohei. I have been waiting. Let's fight. No, I didn't follow you for that. Why don't we make a deal and cooperate, Juzo? What? If we fight, one of us will die. If not, Dogen of Koga will get you. We don't want a Koga to get the credit for it. I have a plan. You continue your work... Come to get Lord Hideyoshi. I will catch you at it. Not you. Kuroami or someone else. I will get him as you. This way both of us will profit in safety. What do you say, Juzo? - Is this your answer? - Yes. Imbecile! 50 feet high. The tower is 150 feet high. Kuroami, don't you think our instructor is suspicious? Why? He could be in contact with Gohei through Kizaru. Otherwise... How could Gohei surprise me at Fushimi? I can't believe it. Jiroza is a fine Iga ninja. That is why. A fine Iga ninja is a fine plotter. He makes Gohei and me fight. He won't lose in any case. Master, do you really mean to help me? For the love of my daughter... I promise I will help you get Juzo. But we have got to get rid of Dogen before that. Yes, I think so too... But how? Well... You have become senile, Master. I don't blame you. I praise your fine double-crossing. But I hate being made a fool of. I will leave you now. I will go home to Iga for some time. Juzo, do you leave your work unfinished? I don't know. Assassinating Lord Hideyoshi is my honor. I will think it over. Excuse me. Stop! Want to get hurt? It's your fault that he left. Now you have got to get Dogen at least. Before Juzo returns. It's also for our honor. I know what to do. A Koga ninja is nothing. I'm a master of Iga. I failed! Kizaru, your father died. Killed by Dogen. Dogen? And you did nothing? I got there too late. Why didn't you avenge him? Why should I? As an Iga man. I'm no longer one. You are his son. Cut it out. We aren't formally married! Then, what are you to him? A stranger. Don't be so mad. Didn't you understand? This is for my father! Dogen killed him, not me. Don't misunderstand. I don't. I will kill both you and Dogen! Calm down! Kizaru! Who are you? I am Kumotaro. I will harpoon anyone who molests her. An ex-fisherman? Kizaru, you suit each other. Want to die? Don't kill him! All right... I will spare him, for your father's sake. Live happily with her. You bastard! Kizaru... Father! Father! Come on in. I am in. Kohagi? How did you find me? Did you think I couldn't? Kohagi... Tell me who you really are. I'm Imai's daughter, as you know. That's all. Don't lie! You are Koga Mari Dogen's pupil. And Dogen works for the Governor of Kyoto now. Nobody would do better than you in pretending ignorance. Sir Juzo, do you dislike me? Answer me! What would you do if I tell you... ...that I would like to live with you for life? Let's disappear together! If you continue your work... ...you will have to die in misery. I know what happened to your parents and your sister. I understand you hate Lord Hideyoshi. But should humans live with only hatred? Shouldn't they live happily? I have come to think that way since I met you. But if this goes on... You say you will kill me? And we will have to kill each other in the end. So let us hide and live together. I refuse. I can't leave my work because of love. Do you mean your work is more important than a woman? Then I will return to my own work. I will have to kill you. It's all right. I admire your self control as a Koga. Maybe it's more than mere admiration. Sir Juzo... From tomorrow, I will treat you as an enemy. I will do the same with you. Be careful. What is it? Have you killed Juzo, my lady? Not yet. Do it quickly. Master Dogen already killed Jiroza. And the Iga men... What...? What about my men! Too late now. Dogen and his Koga ninja must be surrounding them. Gohei helps us. If you go now, I will have to fight you. Do you insist on going? Kuroami, do you recognize me? I am Mimi who you scorned as a beggar. I am your enemy now. It's natural that an Iga take side with his employer. It's unfortunate you didn't hire me. This will be the day of your death. May God be with your poor soul! It's useless to run! You have been surrounded by Koga men. So you betrayed us? Koga or Iga makes no difference to a beggar like me. And the Koga people don't treat me so coldly as you did. You wretch! Someone! Genzaemon is here. Shikaji is here. Sakichi is here. Men, we must fight! Who is the opponent? Mari Dogen of Koga. Dogen! Kuroami, we often worked together in our younger days. In those days the land was in confusion. There were many work places for both ninja from Koga and Iga and the quality of our life was much better. But there is peace now. We have to fight each other to get work. It's a struggle for survival. Don't hesitate to attack us! You will see how we Iga men fight! Well said! You have my admiration. Let's prove ourselves as ninja in this moonlight. They ran! Get them! Keep together! Dogen, come out! Dogen, come out! Kuroami, I will send you to hell. Kuroami, I am Gohei. I will help you die. You betrayer! Gohei, you will suffer the curse of the Iga clan. Well done. If you didn't kill him, I would have killed you. Dogen! Who is it? Juzo Tsuruza of Iga. Do you want to avenge your men? That's unusual, for a ninja. You and I are destined to fight to the finish. I appreciate your coming. Tell me whether you want to be killed or captured? Enough talking big. Juzo, you win. Don't kill me. Spare my life. Want to live? Of course I want to live. Listen, there are two women waiting for me in Koga. They cannot live without me. I hope you will spare me for them. Let me go home! All right, go and be taken care of for your life. Fine. I begged for your mercy, taking advantage of your nature. This is your defeat. You cannot kill me, can you? You are skillful but not a real ninja warrior. Gohei, dirty coward! Come out! Shouldn't humans live happily? Sir Juzo. Sir Juzo! Sir Juzo! Sir Juzo, what is the matter with you? Let me lie down and rest. I will have your bed made immediately. Kohagi, I took revenge for Kuroami and the others. I leave myself at your disposal. You may capture me or kill me. My lady! You have had relations with him? Haven't you? What if I have? For a woman, the man she gives herself to is her life. Now, it's whether you live as a woman of love... ...or live as a Koga ninja. My lady, Master Dogen! So, you have taken his life at last. My lady! This is my answer. Are you awake? How long did I sleep? Two full days. I see... And you didn't capture or kill me. Why should I? I want to live with you. You know that. Live... Death threatened me many times on my way here. I managed to reach here because of you. Everything looked empty. Only what was between us felt real to me... ...when I was at the door of death that night. I didn't think this way before. Sir Juzo! Betrayer! You will suffer the curse of the Iga clan! Where are you going? You are awake? Any regrets? I must leave you. I thought of giving up my work because of you. I'm surprised at myself. I won't stop you. I want you to act as before. Take it as my keepsake. Should humans live with only hatred? Sorry! Forgive me! Don't stare at me like that! Forgive me! Hideyoshi's death will cause an all-out war. That's what I want. I make money in wars. Are you Hideyoshi? Yes, I am Hideyoshi. Quiet! If you make a noise, I will stab you to death. You look senile. What do you want? - I came to kill you. - Why? Ask yourself that. You have done much evil. But every time, I did it for the country. Excuse yourself in hell! Please! You have got to give up now. I want to live. I pity you. I never imagined that you were so senile. You won't live much longer anyway. It feels rather cruel to kill you now. Will you let me live? My parents and my sister were killed by your men. Is that so? I understand how you feel about me. But, don't think I don't suffer for it. My conscious bothers me every night... My victims appear in my dreams. Power gives me no relief. I saw that. Iga ninja... What? Will you forgive me? I would. Under one condition. What should I do? Thank me for sparing you. Speak, I risked my life to get here. I don't think I will be able to get out easily. It's natural you should thank me. Or do you think you should not lower yourself? You won't tell? I can't promise. I have a mouth. Then I won't! What? Then I will... What will you do? Be careful! No! Stop it! Guards! Guards! Guards, come help me! It was a stupid comedy, Hideyoshi. I caught you, Juzo! Too late, Gohei. I know. I wasn't in time, but I will be rewarded. I didn't kill Hideyoshi. What?! I lost interest in that fool. Maybe I am not fit to be a ninja and for killing. You are stupid and will die for nothing. No, I won't. Fool! Gohei, listen to an old friend. I understand you very well, you would like to live in peace. But what you do is too low. You talk too much! That is enough. Gohei, take care of yourself. Come down, Juzo! Wait! No, don't mistake me for the intruder. I came to arrest the intruder. Don't misunderstand! Go ahead! Arrest him! Don't mistreat me. Idiots. My Lord, thank you for coming. I'm sorry for causing this mistake... My Lord... This man's testimony is false. I have never seen him before. What did you say?! Now I see... You neglect your vassal when he makes a mistake. Shut up! Never! Now I will tell everything I know. The ninja who sought the Lord's life... is Juzo of Iga, and he was hired by Imai of Sakai... Enough! Execute him as an example. Look at you, Gohei. What a miserable state you are in... ...you who chose to live in the sun. Kuroami? I'm ashamed. I didn't figure on Geni's betrayal. A ninja of the clan is an owl living in darkness. His envy of easy going sparrows brings nothing. I was wrong. Juzo, you? Then the voice was yours? You must be beside yourself not to know my voice. What did you come for? I came to save you from being mistakenly executed. Thanks. I can't stand these shackles. Free my hands first, will you? Juzo, I caught you at last! What are you doing? Too late! It's too late. Sir Juzo. Kohagi? Kohagi... I didn't kill Hideyoshi. I was disillusioned when I saw him. And my hatred was gone too. I came to think how it was silly to cause a war... ...and to profit a merchant. I will live not as an Iga ninja but as a real man. Kohagi... Come with me into the mountains. Sir Juzo... That will be our home. Can you stand that? I have never seen such a beautiful castle. A beautiful castle... Kumotaro! Master! Master! Special Thanks to "Toyo Ichi" Subtitled and Mastered by Cannibal King
