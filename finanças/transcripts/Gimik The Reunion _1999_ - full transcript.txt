[music playing] [cheerful music playing] [Ricky] These are my friends. Diane and I are best friends with Gary and Gina. Despite their struggles, it's amazing how Gary and Gina have stayed in love with each other. The only thing left to do is get married. In contrast to Gary and Gina's relationship, Brian and Melanie's was a stormy one. The biggest hindrance was Brian's mom. I wonder if the sun will ever rise for these two lovebirds? [cheerful music playing] Bright and sunny-- that's how you describe Joey and Ese's love story. There's never a dull moment with these two. And for all their problems, laughter is the solution. [music continuously playing] And, of course, there's Diane, the love of my life. Unfortunately, we're no longer together. When they migrated to the States, we agreed to open ourselves to other relationships. [music playing] A lot of challenges await us after graduation. But I'm not afraid. Because we've always got each other's back. [music playing] Aah! It's party time! The place is packed! Come on, let's go! -Hey! -Hello! [shrieking] -[upbeat music playing] -[indistinct chatter] [music playing] Right? Cheers! -Look at that. -[laughing] -Really? -Of course! When it comes to business, Brenda is truly brilliant. But, Ricky, I don't only give you good business. I give you great pleasure, too! [both] Whoa! Honey, I'm sure that when it comes to performance, you don't have any complaints, right? -Well, what can I say? -Wanna try me sometime? -No way! -Sorry, but no, thanks. Ricky! Hi, Brenda! Dude! -Dude. How are you? -I'm okay. -You're good? -Yeah. -Hi. -Hi. Enjoy the party, okay? -[indistinct] -Yeah. So, dude... Who's he? Friends. Long time, no see. How's medical school? -Mm, it's fine. -Really? Wait a second... Aren't you in the night class? [lively chatter] Don't tell me you skipped school just to be here? You know I wouldn't do that, dude. Wait, is the gang here already? Not yet. [ambulance sirens wailing] The ambulance can't get through. I think the kid who got ran over by a bus is in there. He got hit really hard. Poor kid! He got thrown into the air, and his head hit the sidewalk! His brains were scattered all over! [sirens continue wailing] I don't think he'll make it to the hospital. That's impossible. [sirens continue wailing] -[tuts] -[exhales] [no audio] [groans] Hurry up, Ese! You'll be late! Mommy, are you sure it's okay if I go out? Of course! I can handle this! You're cheating! Okay, your turn. Go and have a good time. [Ese] Jen-Jen's diapers are in the room. And Daddy's diapers are in the bathroom. -Just a second, Labs. -Okay. Go now! I'll take it from here! Bye, Daddy! I'll be back soon. -Bye! [smooches] -We'll go ahead. -Come home early, okay? -And you... turn off the TV and study your lessons, okay? Bye-bye. [smooches] -Let's go. -Okay. -Bye, Mom! -Mom?! [giggles] -Come back soon, sis! -Have a good time, kids! Bring me something when you get home, okay? Sure, sure! Bye! Joey, take care of my baby, okay? [man over phone] Hello, Gina. I need those reports proofread and compiled by 5 a.m. tomorrow at my house. I need to go through them before I make my presentation to the board. It's imperative that I get those reports. I don't want to lose face before the board. Can you do it? [sets cup on table] Ah, yes, sir. Are you sure? Yes, sir. Okay. Good night. [groans] Aren't you done yet? Maybe we shouldn't go. What's the matter with you? Gary, the gang is expecting us. Besides, Ricky might feel bad. He was nice enough to invite us, then you don't want to show up? The question is, does Ricky really want me there? [exhales] You two are really something! You guys used to be the best of friends, you know? Yeah, we used to be. Until he became arrogant. He thinks he's a big shot just because he opened a restaurant. Not to mention his snobby girlfriend! That's enough, Gary. Let's go already. Please, baby? Mm? Come on... -[moans] -[both chuckle] -So? -Fine! But only until midnight! Okay! [smooches] Do I look handsome now, Labs? Am I as handsome as my new car? [car revs] I think it's better that we go home, My Labs. [Joey sighs] Please? We're already here, My Labs. [car revs] You're always like that whenever we go out. When was the last time we went out with the gang? Six months ago. Come on! Let's go! Hurry. Come on... This smile is going to be like Cinderella, here only up to midnight. [scoffs] Ese! Ese! -Gina! -Joey! -Gary! -Hi! -Joey, I missed you! -How are you? -Long time, no see, dude! -Bro! When's the wedding? February 28. Don't miss it, okay? -[Joey] Of course! -Ese, you look great! [Gary] Yeah! -[vehicles revving] -[music playing] [Joey] Ah, anyway, uh... [Brian] Smile! [shutter sound] [all] Brian! -How are you, bro? -Looking great, dude! [chuckling] What took you so long? Ricky has been waiting for you inside. I bet he's been griping about how late we are and that we've never changed. Don't tell me you're still in bad terms with Ricky? Well... -Miss, you forgot to... -Were you here early, Brian? Ah... Yes. Excuse me, Melanie's here. -[chuckles] -Hey! -[Ese] It's Melanie! -Miss! Miss! Huh? Look, I know you're cute, but... -...you still have to pay. -Oops, I'm sorry! [music playing] I got this, Mel. How much? Fifty. -Melanie! -Hi, guys! -Okay, now we're complete! -How are you? Let's go inside. Ricky's waiting. -[loud chatter] -[music playing] [Gina groaning] Excuse me. Excuse me. -[indistinct chatter] -[music playing] Excuse me. Can we leave earlier, say, at eleven? -Stop it, Gary! Let's go. -Damn it. [music continuously playing] Joey, I can't breathe here. Let's just go home. This place is okay! It looks fun! Once we find a seat, we'll be all right, okay. We have a table inside, Joey! Let's go inside! Just straight ahead. [indistinct chatter] My Labs. [music continuously playing] Okay, great! Wait a second, I'll be back. -Guys! -Ricky! -Good you could come! -[Gina] Hey! Ricky. I was getting worried you wouldn't make it. It's good to see you, guys! Thanks for coming. [woman shrieking] Congratulations on the success of your bar, Ricky! Thanks, and, wow... ...of course, most of the credit goes to my loving partner here... ...who can do just about everything! Right? [Brenda] Except to convince you to marry me and have a baby. [Ricky scoffs] Well... Excuse me, guys, I'll just borrow Ricky for a while. Andy's here. -Annie? -Andy! -Andy! Right now? -As in now. I'll have to go first. Excuse me. If you want anything--food, drinks--just order, okay? It's on me. [music playing] [Ricky] Andy! -Hi, Ricky! -Hey, man! -The place is rocking, dude. -I know, right? Poor Ricky. I don't think he can escape that leash tied around his neck. Is she Diane's replacement? [indistinct chatter] [upbeat music playing] Come on, Gary! Let's dance! # I've been watching The same old channels # # Listening to The same old song # # Everywhere I Turn my head # # I keep seeing Something wrong # # Everything reminds Me of you # # Everything I see is you # # Burn, baby # # Burn, baby # # Burn, baby # # Burn, baby # # Burn, baby # # Burn, baby # # Burn, baby # Thanks, Maan! Here. [singing continues] This must be my lucky night, dude! Why? What's the name of that chick? [singing continues] Sorry, man, she's off-limits. That's my friend's fiancee, okay? I don't see a wedding ring. [Gina chuckling] [Gina] Gary! I know you, Andy. I'm begging you, please don't do it. [music continuously playing] [thunder rumbling] Too bad it rained. Yeah. I'll just look for Ese so we can go home. Okay, you go ahead. I'll just wait for Gary. -[indistinct chatter] -[music playing] Hi! No, thanks. I'm Andy, Ricky's friend. You're Gina, right? Please? Thank you. You're a really good dancer by the way. Thanks. -Excuse me, I have to---Hold on. Just a moment. -Stay here. -[Gina groans] -No need to rush. Let's talk. -Excuse me, please! -Bro! -[Gina shrieks] Gary! Are you hitting on my girlfriend?! [Gina] Gary, that's enough! We're in a party, okay? That's enough! -I don't care! -That's enough. Walk away. Sorry. [indistinct chatter] Gary. Andy? [door opens] I told you not to invite them, but you insisted. Look, babe. I don't think it's Gary's fault. You know, Andy. When it comes to women, he's out of control. So, you're taking the side of your immature friend? Andy is a major stockholder in our business. It's embarrassing! I told him not to flirt with Gina. But what did he do? He didn't listen! Oh, yeah? Seems to me like she was flirting with Andy. Look, she was not flirting with Andy! I know her, and she's not that type! There you go again with your "perfect" friends! Why don't you make them your business partners? Have them solve your problems, too! And marry them while you're at it! Cut it out, Brenda! But it's true! They have it easy! But what about me? I play your girlfriend, business partner, lover, mother, sister, and sometimes even a nanny! Not to mention your friends that make things worse! I wouldn't be acting like this if you at least planned to propose to me. But until now, you haven't! -I think I better go. -What? You're not sleeping here? Nope. I'll just come back once things cool down. [heavy raindrops] [sad music playing] Damn it! [Ricky] That night, I proved a formula. Brenda and the gang don't mix. If you force it, it will cause an explosive reaction. Worse than a nuclear holocaust. But I need them both. Even though it's suicide. What do you think of my wedding gowns? A wedding express? I couldn't attend to it right away because I was busy. What if I tell you I'm busy as well? -[phone ringing] -[Gina groans] [beeps] -Hello? -Hello! - Oh! - Not again. Hi, Ricky! Yes, I'm here with my wedding gown designer. Well, there's a bit of a problem. You want to talk to Gary? [mouthing words] -Please? -[mouthing] No. Hello? Ricky? He went to the restroom. Yes. I see. Ah... Hang on, let me check. He wants to apologize about the party last night. He's inviting us out for dinner. Mm? [sighs] Ah, hello? Ricky. I just remembered that we have this family planning seminar later. Yeah, we do. Sure. Next time, I promise. Bye! Okay. Bye, Gina. [beeps] [buttons beeping] Hello, Ese! Hello? Hello? Huh? Hey, Ricky! -Wait, I can't hear you! -Ese! -Where is my... -Just a second, Daddy! I need my bedpan! Yes, Daddy! Is that phone call more important than me?! Hang on, Ricky. You know I'm busy taking care of my dad. -Ese! I need your help! -Yes, Daddy! Ever since his accident, I'm the only one attending to his needs. Here's what you can do. Just... call up Joey. He's in the shop. -What? -Hang up the phone! Just a second, Dad. What? -Okay, I'm hanging up! Bye! -That's enough! Coming! [song playing over speakers] [phone ringing] [phone ringing] Hello? Dude! How are you doing? [music continuously playing] As usual, just running the business. I'm troubleshooting the computer. Mm-mm. [music continuously playing] [Joey] Ah... Dude... I can't. I have a client call tonight. Ese and I will just call you. Sure. I have to go, dude. I'm kinda busy with some stuff. Okay, bye! [hangs up] [typing] [music playing] [soft music playing] [knocking on door] Brian? Just a second, Ma! Brian! I'll be out in a second! Coming! [knocking continues] Brian! -Yes, Ma? -Why aren't you in school yet? I'll just take a shower. Ricky called. I told him you're leaving for school. -Why didn't you call me? -Well, why are you still here? Hurry up! You might be late again! Yes, Ma. -[door shuts] -Oh, my. -[patient] Thank you. -[woman over PA] [indistinct chatter] Nurse Melanie Suntay, call on Line 3. [sobbing] -What happened here? -He was stabbed. [nurse] Check his blood pressure. Doc, IV. [patient gasping] [melancholic music ensues] [shrieking] [sobbing] [melancholic music intensifies] [kettle whistling] -[water burbling] -[doorbell ringing] [doorbell ringing] [door opens] I'm ready to forgive you. Is there something you want to say? I'm sorry. I knew you'd see it my way! Well, you always do. Mmm... -Mmm... -[chuckles] -I've missed you. -I've missed you. [laughing] -I have something for you! -Oh, yeah? Dorothy, please prepare Ricky's food. -Here. -Hi, Alice! Wow, babe! You shouldn't have. Oh, gee, Ricky! Your pad is such a mess! You have a hamper, but--- I don't understand why these are all scattered here! Ms. Esguerra, -can you identify this part? -Yes, sir. -This is brachioradialis. -It's "brachio!" -Say it! -"Brachio." You want to fail? [cheerful music playing] [snoring] Mr. Lorenzo? Mr. Lorenzo! [yells] Lorenzo! -Hey, wake up! -Sir's here! Good morning! Can you identify the cause of death of the patient-- [cheerful music continuously playing] He died in his sleep, sir. How do you expect to save a man's life if you don't know what you're doing? Listen. If you won't take your studies seriously... [yells] just drop the hell out! Sex is important to a couple. Did you hear that? She said it's important! [Gina moaning] It's also important for you to learn about responsible parenthood. To know the safe and unsafe days for your wife, you need to carefully... [chuckles] ...study their menstrual cycle. If she has an irregular period, it may be difficult to determine the safe and unsafe days. Unexpected pregnancies may occur, or a woman may have difficulty getting pregnant. So, I suggest, as early as now-- I guess I should be familiar with your menstrual cycle. I suppose you get them regularly? Gary, what if I can't have a baby? Then I won't marry you! -[thumps] -[chuckles] What did you just say? You won't marry me?! -[chuckling] -You deserve that! [facilitator] Please listen! [chuckling] [smooches] [music playing] -Sure, I'll go ahead. -Okay. Where's Melanie? She's speaking with our head nurse inside the room. -Hey, nice flowers. -It's for--- -Are those for me? -No, they're for Melanie. Excuse me. Melanie! Melanie, can we-- -This suits your husband's den. -You're right. And I think this one will look great in your dining room. Excuse me, ma'am. Gary is here. You can direct your questions to her, okay? -[footsteps] -[indistinct chatter] -Hi, Mom! -Hello! Hi! [Gina moans] What's wrong? Wedding jitters? [Gina moans] No. I just have a lot on my head right now. I was exactly like that before I married Chito. Oh, my god. I still remember mom's wedding list. -It was one kilometer long! -[chuckling] Well, you should really make a list... so you won't forget anything before the wedding. Like visiting your dentist, going to the doctor, and having a checkup with your OB-GYN before the wedding. -Is it really necessary? -Yes! Because I've never been to one. Here's the address of my gynecologist. Aside from being good at her job, she's also nice. Make an appointment with her next week, okay? Yeah. Thank you. [indistinct chatter] What else is bothering you? My work, problems with my wedding gown... [indistinct chatter] Wait, I know a designer! She's good, and she works fast. She'll even give you a friendly rate! I--- I can't do it. But you haven't even tried it yet. Powder, powder. Gina, times have changed. [blows raspberry] I have a lot on my plate now. I can't commit to that. What's the matter, Ese? You weren't like that before. You were always up for any kind of challenge. Maybe I just don't want to disappoint you. [exhales] [footsteps] [Gary] Such a heavy baby. Ese... [Gary] You're so heavy. ...I need to cut down on my costs. [humming] Besides, you could use some extra income. [Gary] Look at the sky... Please? [Gary] Look! Come on, Ese. We need your help. The wedding is on February 28, right? Three months away! That's still a long way to go! [chuckles] Okay, I'll try. -Yay! -[giggling] Gary! You turned my sister into rice cake! [cheerful music playing] [Ese grunting] [thumps] Ese... please get me some water. [coughs] [music playing] Here you go. Ese, have you seen my white blouse? I've looked everywhere, but I can't seem to find it. Just a second, Ma. Thank you, Ese. [sad music playing] [buttons beeping] [woman on line] Pager ID, please. Pager ID "My Labs." Ma'am, how do you spell that? M-Y-L-A-B-S. Message coming from? Coming from Ese. Message, please. Where are you? [Joey] I hope you don't mind. I have to get my car washed. My baby's getting dirty. [woman] Not at all. It's pretty cool. -[Joey chuckles] -[device beeping] Ugh. Are you having problems with Ese again? [muffled water spray] Actually, we don't really have a problem. She's just busy with her family. That's why... it affects her mood. It's a good thing I always have time for you. [music playing] I love you, Joey. [music continuously playing] That's what you call a "carwash kiss." [music continuously playing] [moans] Ahh... [clacking] When do you usually have your period? It's often delayed so I can't give you an exact answer. Usually, how many days delayed? Days? Usually weeks. Sometimes, even months. Huh? Why didn't you have it checked so we could correct it? Well, it's been like this since my first period. I suppose you're not in a rush to have a baby? Is there a problem, Doc? I suspect Gina has hormonal imbalance. What is that? A lack or excess of hormones that needs to be corrected. Otherwise, you cannot bear a child. Ahh... hold on, Doc. What can we do about it? I will give you a series of tests. When we find the right hormones, we can correct the problem. And you'll be able to bear a child. And what if you can't find or correct the hormones? Then there's no chance for pregnancy. [engines revving] [honks] [knocks] Flowers, sir? [knocks] Just keep it so you can sell it to someone else. Thank you! [music playing] [Ricky] Why is it that no matter how hard I try, I can't get the gang to hang out just like old times? Good thing it's Brian's birthday. We'll see each other again... if everyone shows up. Sorry, I took so long, Ricky. Let's go downstairs. They're waiting for us. Come on! [distant music playing] [Latin music playing] Hello! How are you? Hi! -Are you enjoying yourselves? -Hi, Ma! -Ma! -Oh, hi! -Ricky! -Hi, Auntie! -This is Ricky. -Hi, Ricky. He operates his own bar. -Wow, impressive! -Hi. Of course, you know my son, Brian. Hi, Brian! This is my doctor. Not in the near future. [Brian] Gina! Gary! -Brian! -Hi. Happy birthday! -Happy birthday, dude! -Is Melanie with you? Does she know about your party? You really think I'd forget to invite her? Do I smell romance the second time around? [chuckles] Oh, stop it. -Bri! -What's up? -Gina, hi. -Hi. Sorry, man. I just got a page from Brenda. There's an emergency at the bar. -I'm afraid I have to go. -What? -Happy birthday again. -[clears throat] -Okay, dude. Go ahead. -Gina, I'm just warning you. Once we're married, I'll be wearing the pants in the family. -Stop it, Gary. -Are you implying something? Why? Are you affected? Relax, Ricky. Gary, that's enough. It's my party, okay? Ricky, if you have to go, you have to go. Go ahead. Take care, okay? Go ahead. -Happy birthday, bro. -Thanks, dude. [guests chatting] Let's go. Joey and Ese are inside. They seem to be having a lover's quarrel. [music playing] I told you I couldn't do it, but you kept on insisting. And now you're telling me that it's ugly. I didn't say anything. But I know it's ugly. Ese! Why aren't you introducing me to your boyfriend? Don't worry, I will. [sobbing] Ese... Why are you crying? [moaning] Because... I can feel that... [gasps] Joey has another woman. -[sobbing] -What? Guys, there's something I want to tell you. But promise me you won't tell it to anyone, okay? Fine, what is it? I have a new babe! -What? -Huh? I have a new girl! [sobbing] I think so. Whenever I need him, he's not around. His phone at the shop is always busy. And every time I page him, he doesn't reply. [sobbing] Maybe it's just a hunch. I think Ese already knows. But I couldn't help seeing this girl. You know what I mean? [exhales] I think I got it bad for her. How could you do that to Ese? I won't cheat on Ese, bro. But this girl is really different. It feels great talking to her. [gasping] Maybe it's because I'm always busy at home. And he feels that I don't have time for him anymore... and that I've changed. Maybe the reason why he replaced me is because... I'm no longer beautiful and sexy in his eyes! Ese... [sobbing] -[music playing] -[indistinct chatter] -Maan, where's Brenda? -She's in the office. -Okay, thank you. -Sure. [door creaks open] Hi, honey! -[grunts] -[clattering] I am busting my butt here while you're having fun with your friends?! Hey, hey, hey... Honey? Honey? Honey, no! No! Honey! [gasps] Look, honey. Calm down, okay? The customers can hear us! I don't care! I'll say what I want! I own this bar! Mind you, we're partners here, so show a little respect! Well, if not for me, this place would've collapsed! Look, that's enough! You are going overboard! Oh, yeah?! And what do you think you're doing to me, huh? Almost two years, Ricky! In two years, I gave you everything! All my money, knowledge, and energy! I even gave my body and soul for you and this business! But what do you do? You just take me for granted! You can't even ask me to marry you! Brenda. I love you. And I respect you a lot. Then marry me, Ricky. I want to get married! I want to have kids! But, honey, you know... Brenda? Come on, I'm not yet ready. Then I can't waste any more of my time on something that has no assurance. It's marriage or nothing, Ricky. You decide now. [music playing] I can't do it. [Brenda grunts] [sobbing] [Gina] Brian, I'm sure Melanie has a good reason why she couldn't make it. Come on, bro. Don't be sad. [music playing] -Is it ready? -Yes. Cheenee! -Hi, Brian! -Hi! Is Melanie on duty today? -She's been on leave. -What? -Since when? -Since yesterday. -Why? -She went home to her province. [crickets chirping] [crying] -[ominous sound] -[gasps] [ominous sound] [gasps] [ominous sound] [gasps] [music playing] [gasping] -[sobbing] -Stop crying... It's not your fault, my child. Don't let yourself be affected. [music continuously playing] -Melanie, you have a visitor! -What? Hurry! -What? -Just come here! -Who's the visitor? -Don't ask anymore! Hurry! [chuckles] -Melanie, it's Brian! -Come here! Let's go inside! [giggling] [birds chirping] It's a good thing you had time to visit us. I looked for Melanie at the hospital. -Hmm. -And they told me she's here. That's right. I was worried. How is she? I think she's fine. And you, how are you? I'm okay. [birds chirping] Actually, I'm having problems with my studies. I don't want to be a doctor anymore. How come? While I study on how to save lives... I feel like I'm slowly dying inside. If you don't want to be a doctor, what do you want to do? I still want to see life. But not as a doctor. I want to be a photographer. There's nothing wrong with being a photographer. Why don't you follow your passion? Same reason as before. My mother has high expectations of me. She doesn't listen to what I want. If you will stand by what you want, I suppose she will understand you. But she never gives in to what I want. No matter how much I treasure it. [music playing] Right on time! I'm so hungry now. Hey, eat that later. You'll get a tummy ache. But I'm hungry! We're about to eat! Eat now. What's wrong with Joey's telephone? -It's always busy! -Just keep on trying! What the heck? [both] Daddy! -[groaning] -Daddy, Daddy! Ese! -Don't worry, I can manage! -What happened here? -Daddy! -[groaning] What were you doing? I can manage! Don't help me! You're treating me like a disabled person! I can help myself! Get out! Leave! [grunts] [gasping] Ese, you wash the water spinach, and we'll cook it later. [smooches] You know what, Mommy. Daddy fell earlier. What? Ese, what happened? Mommy... Because, I was feeding the baby, and then... Daddy suddenly fell. I didn't expect it to happen. [sobbing] It's okay. You're tired, just relax. I'll take over. [music playing] [birds chirping] [Melanie] When I graduated, I was confident that I would be a good nurse. Because... I loved what I was doing. [birds chirping] [monitor beeping rhythmically] But something happened. Nurse Melanie, you are so beautiful... and you're so kind. Mm-hmm. You're the beautiful one. And you're so cute. When I grow up, I want to be a nurse, too. That's why... You need to get well soon. So you can grow up right away. Then you'll be a nurse soon enough. -[music playing] -[monitor beeping rhythmically] There we go. Okay? Mmm... Go to sleep now. -[music playing] -[monitor beeping rhythmically] -[phone ringing] -[staff chatting] Yes, Nikka? Nikka? Doctor? -What room? -Room 506. [door opens] [suspenseful music playing] [monitor rapidly beeping] [suspenseful music playing] [beeping persists] [melancholic music playing] [gasping] Every night... I dream of her, asking me for help. [gasps] I can't handle this anymore. I don't know if I can still be a nurse, Brian. [music playing] [gasps] It's okay. [sobs] I don't think I'm ready to go back to the hospital. How about you? Are you ready to face your mother? I don't know. But at this moment, I'm sure of only one thing. What is it? You. [music playing] We'd been separated for a long time, Brian. After all these years, it's still you. I've never loved anybody but you. [music continuously playing] [vehicles revving] [indistinct chatter] Nothing, she was stunned. Good for her. [clamor] [indistinct chatter] [whistles] -What's taking them so long? -[woman shouting] Over here! -Why are you in a hurry? -Here! Hey! Over here-- -There they are! -Daddy! Hello! My daughter is all grown up now. [giggles] Grown up? She's getting married! [chuckles] Hey, I'm warning you, Gary, don't you dare hurt my baby! [laughing] Speaking of babies, since beauty runs in our family... And your husband-to-be is handsome... I think I would like to see lots of cute grandchildren. -[laughing] -[groans] [laughing] [Gary coughs] Gary, give us good-looking grandkids right away, okay? Well, Ese, it's a good thing you asked me out. I have so much pressure-- my work, the wedding... And now my parents are here. You know, my mommy is right. We need a break. And one more thing, I really miss Joey. Mmm. I've not been giving him enough of my time. [car engine revving] [car engine revving] Hi! -Hi! I missed you! -I missed you, too. Hmmm. [woman] If I didn't visit you, we wouldn't see each other! Keep your cool, Ese. Just ignore it. Cut it out! -Want anything? Juice, water? -I'm okay. But I know that you want me. Hmmm. [chuckles] [music continuously playing] Just relax, Ese, don't panic. Ese! Ese, what are you going to do? Hey! Ese! -You bastard! -Don't! [thud] Stop! [clattering] Ese! [clattering] -[music continuously playing] -[grunting] [thud] [thud] [sobbing] [thud] [grunting] [clattering] -My Labs! -Ese, that's enough! Don't you dare call me My Labs! Don't you dare come near me, or I'll bash your face! -[grunts] -[clanking] [Ese sobbing] My La- [music continuously playing] [footsteps] What treats did you bring, Ese? [moans] Ese, what happened? [moans] [sobbing] It's okay. It's okay, my child. Stop crying. [music playing] Daddy... [sobbing] Why are you crying? [gasps] Because you're crying. [crying] [chuckles] -[car revs] -[honks] Mark. -Sir? -Why are you not dressed up? Sir, I just came here to get my stuff. Where are you going? Aren't you on duty today? I'm sorry, sir. Ma'am Brenda gave us a better offer at the other bar. My other workmates are already there. Wait... a bar? What bar? Over there, sir. The other bar. Where? Over there, sir. Ma'am Brenda just bought a new bar. By the way, sir... Ma'am Brenda asked me to tell you... That she's pulling out her investments here. So long, sir. [tense music playing] Look, Gina, I'm sorry. We did not hit the right hormone. Doc, we'd been through six different tests already. How many more possibilities do we have? A lot, Gina. We're not going to stop until we can identify the right hormone. Doctor, I'm running out of time, money, and patience. We could always stop, you know. [no audio] [music playing] We'll keep trying. Don't stress yourself too much on this, Gina. It may be one of the reasons for your imbalance. Take it easy and relax. If it's meant to be, it will be done. [exhales] -[phone ringing] -Jen-Jen! Jen-Jen! [phone continues ringing] Jen-Jen! Jen-Jen! Hello? My Labs? [MM] Jen-Jen. [song playing over speakers] [scoffs] [buttons beeping] [song continuously playing] [phone ringing] My Labs... My Labs, your face! [hangs up] [scoffs] [song continuously playing] Gina, help me with your friend. You were unfaithful to Ese, Joey. That's a big deal. I know I did wrong. But she was always busy with her family. You know, Joey, you're right. That what you did is wrong. That's why I understand why Ese is so angry with you. I know it's wrong. And I regret what I did. That's why I let go of Sweetie Pie. I love Ese. That's the problem with you men. You only realize our worth when we're no longer yours. [music playing] [clattering] [footsteps] Ma! Ma, what are you doing? Is she the reason you can't concentrate on your studies? Ma, don't involve Melanie in this, please. You left the house without telling me! You failed to attend your classes without any notice. I can only suspect that you were with that woman again. Ma! Please! Brian, you are in med school and you're not exactly an honor student! You're so irresponsible! Ma, please, stop! I've been responsible all my life! What else do you want from me? [no audio] Ma, I do everything you want. I took up medicine because that's what you want. I gave up Melanie because that's what you want. Even once, have you ever wondered if I'm happy with the things you want for me? We are trying to give you the best of everything! A good life! A good education! That's the point, Ma! You're too preoccupied giving me things... Not once did you ask me for what I want! We know what is best for you! Ma, what's best for me is to let me decide what I want to do with my life! Ma, I want to become a photographer. I don't want to be a doctor anymore. You want to give up being a doctor to take pictures? You're crazy! Ma, I'll become crazy if I continue with my medical studies. Ma, I'm quitting med school! I need to do this for myself. If you don't agree with it, there's nothing I can do. [tense music playing] [gentle music playing] What happened? The test result is still negative. [music continuously playing] Baby... [whimpers] [sobbing] [music playing] Ricky... Have you ever... had this feeling that your life is a waste? You're all fortunate. Your lives have direction. It's leading somewhere. Like, for you, with your business. [music continuously playing] For Gina and Gary, it's marriage. But as for me, I don't know. I wasted several years in medical school. For nothing! Just to be kicked out. Brian, we all have our individual problems. There are things that you have to sacrifice and compromise. Me, I lost a partner. Do you know that? And for all I know, maybe tomorrow, or the day after, I'll lose everything I worked hard for. [music continuously playing] But you know what? My biggest sacrifice in life is... Losing Melanie. I will never make that mistake again. Come what may. Same here. You know, Bri, at this point... I still don't know if I wasted time with my relationship with Brenda. Come what may, indeed! [music continuously playing] -You're cute when you're crying. -[chuckles] Stop crying, okay? Let's just drink! That's enough. You'll be driving. Ese! My Labs! Please talk to me. Ese! My Labs! My sister doesn't want to talk to you! Please, MM! I really need to talk to her. No! I'm mad at you. You make my sister cry! Will you not stop? My Labs, I won't stop. Even if I have to sleep out here, just so you'd talk to me. Here, Ese. Go ahead, smash it on my head. I will accept it wholeheartedly. Why would I do that to you? Wow, My Labs, thank you! I knew it, you still love me. ...if I can do this instead! My Labs! So?! Will you leave now? Okay, I'll go. I should have gone home. Bro. Bro. It's morning already, I have to go. No, stay here, bro. We'll drink more. I have more. I have more beer. I really need to talk to Melanie. What?! Please, it's morning already. -Melanie? -Yes. -Bro! -Shh! Enough. Don't leave me. Don't. Don't leave me! Dude! Don't leave me! -Don't leave me! Wait, wait. -I have to go to Melanie. What?! -I have to go. -Bro, don't leave yet. -Bro, you're drunk... -Shh! I'm okay, I just have to go to Melanie. -No, you better sleep it off. -No. -I really need it. -What, what? I have to go to her. -Bro, your breath smells bad. -No! -Bro, you might miss me. -I really have to go to Melanie. -Enough of Melanie. -I miss her. -You miss me more! -No, I love you. Okay, that's way better. I love you too. Really? Promise me we'll do this again, bro? No problem! Wait, you have slime. Stinky! Okay, take care. It's you they should be careful with! -Bye! -Bye! [music playing] -[people shouting] -Look out! [car crashing] [tragic music playing] -Welcome back, Melanie! -Good morning! -Hey, Melanie! -Hello! [ambulance siren] -Sid, call the doctor! -Okay. Operator? Please page Dr. de los Reyes. Dr. de los Reyes, please proceed to the E.R. Car accident. Possibly driving under the influence of alcohol. Quick, call the doctor! Okay, on three. One, two, three! This man has lost a lot of blood. Doc, the neck is the source of trauma. Miss? Where's the room of Brian Lorenzo? Wait, I'll check. Gina. He's still in the operating room. Ricky, how's Brian? He was rushed to the O.R. How is he? Not good. Does his mother know? I'll call her, let me borrow a phone. -Here, here. -Let me have your phone, Gina. Wait a minute. So will we just wait for you? Okay. Okay, goodbye. Hi, My Labs. My Labs? My Labs your face. From now on you no longer have the right to call me My Labs, okay? Ese, please. Not here, Joey. So... so if not here, it means, I can go to your house again to court you. Ricky, don't feel guilty. It's not your fault. I was so drunk. I should have not let him go. I'm pretty sure you tried to stop him. He was just persistent. But the least I could have done was to be with him, right? I'm so irresponsible. An irresponsible friend. An irresponsible employer. I haven't done anything right. Ricky... Don't think about your bar right now. Let's set aside our problems for now. Let's focus on Brian, okay? Let's pray for him. We have to be strong together. Melanie. What's the update, Melanie? -How's Brian? -What now? He is now stable. Oh, thank you. Can we talk to him? Not yet because he is still sedated, but later on you may. It's all my fault. I shouldn't have scolded him. I should have just listened to him. Don't worry, Mrs. Lorenzo. Brian is now safe. Thank you, Melanie. Okay then. Thank you for saving my life. Thank you for saving my life. Brian, don't thank me. I should thank you for saving mine. Anytime. As long as it is you. [door closing] [sighs] Here's your pillow, Dad. If ever you need me, I'm just inside. Thank you. It's funny. Before, I was the one who changed your diaper, who served you milk, I sang you to sleep. Now you're the one who does all this for me. Is it hard to take care of this baby? Sometimes, when you're mad and... being stubborn. Sit here, beside me. I'm sorry. I know that... because of us, you're losing time for yourself. But don't worry. I will change, and I want you to change as well. Yes. Together, let's redeem ourselves. -Okay? -Yes. Enough of those tears. -Here comes mommy! -Hello, baby! [phone ringing] -Hello! -Here she comes! -Hello? -Hello, Auntie? -Oh, Joey! -Is Ese there? You're quite late, she just left. She went to the gym. Gym? # Why did you leave? # # Why did you forget? # # It never crossed my mind # # That you will change # # Your love has faded # # I always hope # # That you'll call and meet me # # We agreed to meet by 9, It's 12 but you aren't here # # Where are you? # # At the party # # You're always gone # # La la la la la la la la # # You're always gone # # La la la la la la la la # # You're always gone # # La la la la la la la la # # You're always gone # # La la la la la la la la # # It's already morning, My friend # # I was awakened to The reality # # You're no longer on my mind # # It will never change # # I'm sick of people like you # # You're always gone # Bri! Ricky! -Bro, how are you? -Bro, I'm okay. How are you? I'm fine, good thing you were able to visit. When were you discharged from the hospital? Just recently. At least, I have the excuse to fix the dispute between you and Gary. I hope you guys won't refuse. Now that I have another chance to be with you guys. Gary? I feel sorry that I took this accident to have the opportunity to apologize. I know that you're angry at me. And I'm admitting my mistakes. I have mistakes too. I couldn't accept the fact that you've changed. Ever since graduation, I always wanted to be successful. And it's Brenda who helped me to achieve my goals. My only mistake is... I thought that success meant giving up friendships. Now I have no one to depend on because I no longer have friends. I miss you guys. And I miss the old Ricky. We all miss you too, bro. I miss my best friend. That's the Gary and Ricky I know. Well, guys, welcome back and Merry Christmas. -And also with you! -And also with you! Ouch! What else? -Hey, Melanie, let's go there! -Okay. [child laughing] What? Here's another one. Love you, Dad. Gina? Why? What's wrong? I don't want to get married. -Huh? -Why?! I really love Gary. So much. I just don't want to deprive him of the joy of being a father. Wait, it's so unclear. I don't get it. Because my OB-GYN said that I might be incapable of having a baby. Are you sure you want to close down this bar, bro? Do I have a choice? Oops, wait, Gary, give me that. -Don't touch that. -It's too early. Do I have a choice? First, Brenda pulled out her investment. Then I lost my crew. I also lost my customers. It's hard to admit but Brenda was the reason this business did well. Why, dude? Is Brenda the only one who can run a business? Bro, I think Joey is right. When was he ever right? He is never right. Trust me, dude. Don't underestimate the gang. If money is your problem then worry no more. -I can lend you some. -Wow! If you are looking for crew, no problem. I know some people. The best! Thank you. What are you having? -I'll have tenderloin. -What's that? Didn't we order sizzling pork? That's already cold! Like these cold mushrooms! We should have ordered cold cuts! It's been ages since we ordered! What's taking so long? -What's wrong with this place? -Okay, I'll just replace it. It takes so long! I've been following up on my order. It's still not here! I'm sorry, sir. -I'll just check again. -Hurry, then! Are you okay, bro? Can you still handle it? I don't think I can do it anymore. Okay, just stay in the kitchen. Three glasses of orange juice and one iced tea. Just a second, My Labs! Three glasses of orange juice, one iced tea. My Labs... Please talk to me, My Labs. Joey, we are working. This is not the right place and time. I'm really having a hard time. The gall! Those times when I was really having a tough time, where were you? Weren't you flirting with that girl on the internet? So don't start telling me you're having a difficult time now. Because it's your fault after all, okay? Three glasses of orange juice, one iced tea! What's your problem? What's my problem? Your sizzling pork isn't sizzling! The vinegar fish the customer ordered isn't ready! That's my problem! Look, I'm already rattled here. The problem with you, is you can't get the correct order! You can't cook the right food! And you can't have a baby! Sorry. What did you just say? It just slipped out? In the middle of vinegar fish and sizzling pork, it just slipped out? Maybe it's always on your mind, that's why you can't help but say it. If it bothers you that much and you think of me less because I possibly can't get pregnant... Let's just call off the wedding! Ricky! Our customers are leaving! -What! -Yes! -What's the problem now? -There are angry customers, bro. -I'll take care of it. -Go there! -Help me, Ese! -Why? Sing to them! Just sing! And what if they leave for good? I don't want to, Ricky! Please, Ese, please! They're leaving now. I'm not ready! What will I do there? Just sing! Do anything! I'll do cut one. That's a minus one.

[Ricky] I lost my business. Along with my self-esteem. Nothing is left. Merry Christmas, Ricky. Sing! A-B-C-D-E-F-G... Look at me, look at Daddy! -What are you looking at? -Good afternoon. -Joey! Come in! -Come in, Joey. Here, sit down. Ese is not here. I know. So why are you here? To take care of the baby. I just want to help you in whatever way. Oh, that's not necessary, Joey. Don't bother. Ese may not like it. I'm also doing this for Ese. I know... I failed her. So, allow me to make up for it. You really love my daughter. So much. ["Mahal Mo Ba Ako?" by Jolina Magdangal playing] Hello? Are you a good boy now? -I'm a good boy. -Are you sure? Yes. Santa wants to know, if you've been naughty or nice? I'm nice. Okay, I forgive you! Really? But... Let's just stay friends in the meantime. Yes... but why? I still have to fix a lot of things in my life. I still have to bring back the old Ese you loved. -But, My Labs... -My Labs... Joey! -My Labs? -Joey! Maybe, it'll be better if you bring your car here. My Labs, there's no more space for dents. My car already looks like a bottle cap. Just bring your car here, Joey. I know what to do, okay? -Bye! -My Labs, wait! Come here, you eavesdroppers! Gary... By next year, I should be putting up baby stockings for my grandchild. What's wrong? Why is it like this? How come I'm suddenly not sure about marrying Gina? It's just cold feet. It'll fade. Why? Are you having problems? Her OB-GYN says, she might never get pregnant. Gary, how much do you love Gina? You know how much. Yes, I do. It's you who's forgetting. But this is different. It's a lifetime commitment, Ma! I want to have children. You know what I think? If you really love Gina, you will accept her completely. Regardless of whether she can give you kids or not. Just think of it this way. Can you spend the rest of your life without Gina? -Come on, hurry! -Where are you bringing me? We might slip! My Labs... I have a surprise for you! One, two, three, surprise! My Labs, what's that? My Christmas gift to you! Are you still mad at me? Come on, hurry! There! [giggles] You don't like it? I like it! Pretty, isn't it? I like it a lot, see? Really? Then let's go! Come on. Why? -Let's go on a joyride! -Joyride? [music playing] -Gi, is it okay? -Yes, okay! -Merry Christmas! -Susan... [Gigi] Can you bring this to 407? Hey, Merry Christmas, too! There's something I want to tell you but... this is not the right place. Come on, come with me. Where? I'm on duty. Leave it to Gigi. Gi, will you take care of things here? -Yeah, sure! -See, it's fine with them. -Okay. -This won't take long. -I'll be back. -Okay. The head nurse might be looking for me. She won't look for you, trust me. I'll just show you something really quick. Wait, wait, there's something missing. Don't peep, okay? What's this? Nothing. Don't be scared, okay? My patients are waiting. No, we won't take long. We'll just be around here. Okay, we're almost there. Okay, last step. One... -Two... -What is this? -Be careful... -Oh! Just a few steps... We're almost there. Now, turn around slowly. Don't peek! What's that? # I have loved you Only in my mind # # But I know that There will come a time # # To feel this feeling I have inside # # You're a hopeless romantic Is what they say # # Falling in and out Of love just like a play # # Memorizing each line I still don't know what to say # Go, go! # What to say # # Don't know what to do Whenever you are near # # Don't know what to say My heart is flowing in tears # # When you pass by I could fly # # Every minute Every second of the day # # I think of you in the most Special way # # You're beside me All the time # # All the time # All this time, Melanie, there was nobody else. -No one even came close. -Brian...

Okay! -Cheers! -Cheers! So good! Okay, guys, sit down. You know, guys, even if... I lost my girlfriend... Even if I wasn't lucky with my business... It's okay. I still have reason to celebrate.

Kiss! -[Joey] Kiss! -[Ese] Kiss! [Gina] Come on, Melanie! [shrieking] I also have a reason to celebrate because Ese and I are okay again! -Kiss! Kiss! -Wait, wait a minute! [Ese] We're just friends for now, right? We talked about it, right? But I have a cause to celebrate because... I finished the design of Gina's gown! Here! [Melanie] Let me see! -Let me see! -Ese, it's beautiful! Thank you. That's why you have to go on with the wedding! You know, I'm happy because... All of you have your reasons to celebrate. I just need to hear one word so I can celebrate as well. Gina... Will you marry me? What about the baby? You're already my baby. -[camera shutter clicks] -Hey! That's enough! Enough already! Come on. Hey! Let's just drink! I miss Diane during moments like this. Is she attending your wedding? I hope she comes. Of course she'll come! No way she won't! Diane! We missed you!

Did you ever think of me? [chuckles] Of course, I did! But I'm sure you didn't. I heard you were busy with your business and... With your girlfriend? That's because you left me. But seriously, I've always thought about you. There are a lot of things that I remember about you. In fact, I don't think that I've ever forgotten. -Yeah right. -Yeah! Really? Let's test that. Game! June 14! June 14? The date I proposed to you. -Wow! You're good! -Of course! Okay. -December 22! -December 22, six months after. You accepted. -I'm impressed! Great! -Of course! How about... May 25.

There's nothing to worry about! We go out on gimmicks less often now. But our friendship will never change. You know, I'm very lucky. Because these weirdos are my friends. I hope you will also have friends like them. [music playing]
