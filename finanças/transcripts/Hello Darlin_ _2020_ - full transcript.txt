Get up man. Fuck off. Fuck off mate, you're the one who got knocked out. He broke my nose mate. I swear down blood you are going to regret this. You're dead mate, fucking dead. Nope. Still alive. I have something I want to show you. This, is how I think of you. Remember when that was taken? Er no. We used to go on holiday to Anglesey and you had a pet tortoise. Albert. Albert, that's right Albert [Laughs} You used to take that thing everywhere. You would not leave the house without it. You used to scream and scream. On the way back one year it pissed all over the car. I mean, it flooded it. Ruined all Carol's clothes. She was so angry. Was it worth it? What? Getting yourself in prison. Things were different back then. I loved the para's. I mean that life was everything to me. I loved the excitement. The camaraderie. Combat jumps even the uniform. When I was discharged it was, it was like the world had been pulled from under my feet. So you thought you'd go and rob a truck load of gold? When I came back, your mum looked at me like I was a stranger. You used to run and hide. I fell in with the wrong crowd. And that thing I did, gave me a purpose. People were looking to me for guidance again. I could have done with some of that guidance. They started looking at me when stuff went missing. They used to plant iPods and phones and stuff in my bag, even pencil cases, lunches, it didn't matter. One minute you're a war hero and the next, you were in prison. I know this sounds crazy Holly but, prison really was the best place for me at that time. We had to start all over again and it wasn't like Army life Dad. It was just the two of us. Mum was falling apart. Do you think I could see her? No. Really? Well I can ask but I wouldn't get your hopes up. If you could tho' that would be good. This is for you. I'll take it to your kitchen? Er Yeah. Ah that smells great What is it? Oh it's chicken buryani, my mothers recipe, handed down through the generations. Oh wow! No, it's from a packet. I'm not the best cook and I just wanted to say thank you. Would you like to join me? Okay that's nice. Well look. Tell me where the plates are. Oh Okay! Serving spoon is there. I'll get the plates. Give those to me. That was... really nice. You are a terrible liar. I told you I was a bad cook. You did, you did. I just wanted to say how grateful I was for what you did. Nobody's ever stood up for, us, like you did. You're the first person. How long have they been hassling you? Since my husband was killed. Two years ago. I'm sorry. My husband tried to do as you did but, I tried to stop him. He just couldn't stand the abuse any more, you know? What happened? The police said it was an accident, but he was killed, thrown down the stairs By those two guys? No. They've only been here for the last two months. You know what? I'm sorry, I'm just talking about all my problems. So, do you have any other family here? No. My family is in India. I'm here alone. Actually I want to go back. What about you? Do you have any family? A wife? No wife, no. I have a daughter who I'm trying to get to know, again. Again? I haven't seen her for a long time. Oh that's a shame. Why is that? Ah. Erm, I've been in prison. For a while. You know what? I think it's time I left. Well thank you. I will see you out. I'll get that. Thanks see you. Nice one Les. Holly. Hi. Hey Dad. No I'm fine. I've just spoken to Mum. Yep, she said she would do it. Oh really that's great thanks. You free tomorrow? Okay well she said meet you at 'The Spot'. Do you know what that means? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay erm... I'll let you know how it goes. Alright thanks, see you. About time. Hello darlin' You been waiting long? Nine years. And I'm not your darling any more. I'm surprised you wanted to meet here. I'm surprised you even remembered. Of course I remember. It's not for me. I wanted you to remember what we had. What we could have had, what you lost. Sit down you're giving me neck ache. You look well. Cut the crap. I'm here for Holly's sake and that's all. She said you wanted to talk so talk. Holly. She's all grown up. She's amazing. I just wanted to thank you for, looking after her while I was away. She's a credit to you Carol. Well first of all, you weren't away. You were in fuckin' prison, for armed robbery. Of course I looked after Holly, I didn't have any other choice did I? So save your I'm sorry speech for someone who gives a damn. I've done quite nicely without you and after today I don't expect to see you ever again. I was ill when I was discharged. I know that now. Well. I'm glad you finally understand because I told you years ago that you needed help. But oh no you knew best. Maybe this wasn't a good idea. So that's it? A few truths and you're off? Seems like you have an answer for everything I say. Well say something Les. Say something that actually matters. Stop wanting this fairytale ending. How's walking away going to achieve anything? Sit down. I'll always care you Carol, always. You're the mother of our daughter. I just hope that one day that you'll be able to forgive me. No. I will never forgive you. And you can cut the crap about being ill and understanding what you did wrong. You haven't changed at all. You've only been out five minutes and already you're fighting people. How did you hear about that? A couple of local thugs get beaten up, it gets noticed, it gets circulated. Do me a final favour. What's that? Dig up your money or whatever it is you've got stashed away and get out of our lives once and for all. There's nothing for you here. There's nothing to dig up. Yeah well that's not what the word on the street is. The word on, what kind of circles are you hanging out in? Oh enough. Actions have consequences. If you threaten someone's child are you that stupid that they won't threaten yours? It was a warning, I was never going to hurt the lad. I swear to God if anything happens to Holly because of you. I will personally make sure you never take another breath ever again. Hello Les. Aanya! Sorry am I disturbing you? Er no. What are you doing here? Oh I have a widows' group at the church and then when we were coming out I saw you. I just wanted to say that, I shouldn't have left the way I did that night. I'm sorry, it was wrong. You have nothing to be sorry about. The way my life's going, I'm definitely better off alone. You don't mean that. You know I used to be a paratrooper? Really? Yeah. I did two tours in Afghanistan. It was the only thing I was ever good at. But life before and since has just been... a disaster. You know from what I've known of you, you're a very capable person, and your daughter is back in your life you have a second chance, don't ruin it. Stop wallowing. Walk me home. Well it's nice of you to walk me home. It's very unusual for me. My pleasure. You should be a professional chaperone. Well I'll send you the bill. Oh really. You want to come in? Ah no, I've got to go into town, I've got some things to do. Okay. It was really nice to talk to you. And you. Goodnight I have message for you. This is my city, you leave, you leave. Okay? Hey, hey, leave him alone. Get off. Fuck off Clayton. I have message for you. This is my city, you leave, you leave. Leave town? Fuck that. So this is where it is? No it fucking isn't. I need your help. Those two from last night. Can you find out who they work for? I'll make some enquiries see what I can come up with. Okay. Thanks Yeah, keep hold of the spade. You might be needing it soon. Piss off. Blimey Dad what happened to you? Just a reminder to keep my nose out of other peoples business. Sit down. Wrong crowd was it? Would you like a cup of tea? Yeah that would be lovely. Come in. Look who's here. What happened to your face? Oh it was nothing. Aanya, this is my daughter Holly. Holly, this is my neighbour, Aanya. So sorry I interrupted. No not at all, come in. Shall I just put this down here? Yeah. Holly have you eaten? No. Great. You two sit there and I'll get some plates. So you think it was those two guys from before? Young lads pretending to be gangsters maybe. You know my husband used to tell me that, if you want to kill a snake, you don't just tread on its tail. You cut off its head. What the fuck is that supposed to mean? Holly! Apologise. No, you know it's fine, I interrupted you guys. And I've finished, it's time for me to go. Don't stand up, it's fine, I can see myself out Ok, I'll, er, wash the pot and bring it over. Okay, take care. Bye. What was that for? Was she the reason you beat up those two boys? You like her don't you? And what's that got to do with anything? Dad if you get a charge, you're straight back inside. Well, that would be better for everybody wouldn't it? I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that, it's just your mum's worried that I'm getting you into trouble. Well I can look after myself. Dad. Is it the gold? Holly, there is no gold, the sooner everyone accepts that, the better. Mum's convinced that you've got it. I bet. Er, look Dad. I have got a rehearsal tomorrow at the Church with my choir. You want to come? You're in a choir? Yes. That's great, of course, I'd love to. Cool. I'll send you the details. Also Dad. Her cooking's really bad. It is isn't it, I'm eating it and I think it's encouraging her, she keeps just bringing it round more and more. Just tell her. I can't, her heart's in the right place, you know, it's just, tastebuds have er left the building. You didn't even make an effort look. At least I was trying to disguise it, you know. [Laughs} I can't make an effort with that. Jesus! You need to see these. What am I looking at? They're the two thugs that beat you up. So Holly's talking to a couple of guys. This doesn't prove anything. That's not how I see it. She knows them. Here. Send them to my phone alright? Got it. Cheers Clayton. Hi Holly. Yes. Yeah. I got the address. I know where it is. Yeah the church. Yeah. You are coming by yourself tonight aren't you? Cool, well, I just don't want anyone else watching. No, no, I will come on my own. Alright. Well I'll see you later. Okay. It's on! Dad just checking. You are coming by yourself tonight aren't you? That's not how I see it. She knows them You like her don't you? Anaya! Aanya! Open the door, open the door. Aanya, are you ok? Is any one in the house? There's nobody here. You sure? I'm sure. Has anyone called you. Has anyone been following you? No-one has come anywhere near me or this house. No... Something. What is wrong? There's something I just don't understand, Something's happening, but I don't know what it is. I'm just confused about something, Well why don't you come inside? No, no, no, no I can't come in. Come inside and sit down. I'm sorry, I'm really really sorry, I'm just er. It's just me, I'm just a, I bit a bit confused, about stuff. Okay, okay. But, Please go back inside and I'm gonna, I'll be fine. I can't leave you out here. Please. Please for me. Just go back inside please. Okay, but I'm right there, okay? If you need me I'm right there. What the fuck is he doing here? One more step and I'll snap his neck. No, no, you go. Let go of me you piece of shit. I'm going to need to ask you some questions. And you need to answer me truthfully Her name's Holly. And she's my daughter. I did not know she is daughter to you. What are you telling her? No, no, no, she tell me. She tell me to scare lady next door. She's telling you? Da. Yes, yes. No. Why would she? We have the same boss, I have a job to do. Why you no ask her? Who is this boss? What's his name? I don't know. Where can I find him? If I tell you, you will let me go? Yes. I'll let you go. Woodlands House, in Four Oaks This is all I know. Okay. Come here. Okay and... Da? What happened? Nothing. She was not home. We waited but man come. We leave. Right Hello? Bitch! Derek, It's me. I need to find an address, in Woodlands, Four Oaks. Yeah. When you get the post code just text it to me, I'll take it from there. Right thanks. [Car unlocks} Mum? We have a problem. Hello Darlin' What's going on? Sorry I think I had a nightmare go back to sleep. And why's the fucking door open? For God's sake. Holly! Dad. You alright? We need to talk. Dad, what's wrong? I was at your mother's house last night. I had to er.. I got the address by torturing some guy that was in my flat. What the fuck is going on? Dad you're not making any sense. No. It makes sense. It makes perfect sense. The flashy car. The nice clothes. The big house. You don't work. Where's it all coming from? You've made me a mark. I'm a, I'm a target for the three of you. And I thought what we had was real. Real? Fucking real? I'll tell what's fucking real. Is watching your own mother being humiliated and mocked in the street. Real is being bullied out of school. We had to move Dad. We were broken. You fucking broke us. We used to worry and worry and fucking pray that you'd get back from war. I cried myself to sleep every night and when you finally came back, you went and did a fucking robbery. You never cared about us so just fuck off. I wanted revenge yes. Mum wants payback. She's got no life Dad. Ray controls her. She can't leave the house without his permission and when she does he has her followed. He beats her. The gold is her only way out and you have it. So do the right thing for once. Where are you going? Where are you going? I'm sorry. So you told him everything? I didn't have a choice he was a mess. What did he say? That there's no gold. To be honest Mum I'm done. I don't want to do this to him anymore. No, no. I need you to do one last thing for me. No Mum. Everything alright in here? It's fine. Mum was just saying that she wants me to get a job. Yes. We've spoken about this many times. I'm glad she's finally seen my point of view. Or the alternative is, now that your Dad's out, maybe he should support you from now on. Oh wait. He can't can he? Sorry My bad. Fucking wanker. Look I get perhaps there is no gold. No. Listen to me. I need you to get your Dad to come here tomorrow. Ray will be out. Maybe I can get him to talk to me. How are you going to do that? He said he still loves me. I believe him. Maybe I can give him a few drinks, coax it out of him. Tell him all three of us will run away together. You really think that will work. Mum Dad's not stupid. All men are stupid when it comes to love. Mum no I'm not. Holly. I need you to do this for me. I cannot stand it here any longer. Please. I've been beaten up, I've been.. Robbed, I've been lied to and manipulated and last night I find out it's my own family. I'm sorry. I know that, I know that I deserve it. I do Because I abandoned them when they needed me most. You know, families always come with problems Les. You need to give Holly a second chance. Holly doesn't need me, That's for sure. She does need you. She will always need you. And you need to give yourself a second chance too. I bought this for you. That's sweet. I, have to go. Think about what I said. I will You actually like this stuff? Yeah I really do. So tell me why we are here? You still think I'm going to lead you to the pot of gold at end of the rainbow? Nah. Not really. Stop with this fantasy Derek. It's consuming your life. It's not a fantasy Les, you and I both know that. I'm leaving. It's ime for me to move on. I just need to know that I'm not gonna wake up one morning and see your ugly mug across the other side of the street. Don't follow me Derek. There's no pot of gold where I'm going. Oh. I'm not going to be following you Les. Don't worry about that. Yes? I think I've seen all I need to see. It's best for both of us if I just.. Stick around to keep an eye on things. I would really appreciate that. Dad? Yeah. In here. The door was open so I just... What are you doing? I'm just going to go away for a while. You're leaving? Just stay away for a little bit. Well will you be back? Yeah, I'll be back. Er... Dad? Before you go can you go and see Mum? I don't think that's a good idea. No, please Dad. She's desperate er... She's on the edge Dad. Just see her and listen to what she's got to say and then you can do whatever you want. Please. Okay. I'll call you when I'm done yes? Carol? Carol? Carol? I'm upstairs. What have you done? Carol.. Carol I'm going to take the knife, okay? I've called the Police. Okay. I told them it was you What about... No, no, no. Holly's not involved. I'm going to clean you up okay? I'm going to pick you up okay? Come on. Come on stand up. Come on. I'm sorry. Carol. Carol look at me. You need to go. You need to... you need to leave here now. And run and don't look back. Okay? Yes. Go. Go. Go. Holly it's your, it's your Dad. Don't come back to the house. Just erm... Just don't come back to the house. Dalton! I need to know. Did you kill that man? That man was responsible for a lot of misery Aanya. Maybe even you husband's death. I'll be singing their backing vocals for all their summer gigs, so going round festivals and stuff. Yeah, yeah. That's brilliant. That's good. Yeah I'm pretty excited. I'm where I'm meant to be. Vishnu will look after me. Vishnu always protects good people. I only get a few V.O.'s Every other month, so we will just have to organise the visits and stuff. Oh Dad I'll be here whenever. Really? Yes. Yes, I'm alright Dad. Yes, I've got this. I mean that there is one Vishnu that... will help you visit your family and give you the things you need. That's a bit of a reach Les. Even Vishnu can't do that. Really? Have some faith. Les. So. I was right all along. Shit! What's going to happen now? Nothing. You're not going to take it? No. What would an old git like me do with all that money? So I can do as Les has written? And what was that? Well I'm a bit embarrassed to say actually. He wanted me to take half the gold so that I could visit my family in India. And he wanted me to have a better home in a better place. The rest of it is for his daughter Holly but he doesn't want her to know. It's for the future. I have a feeling Les knew this was gonna happen. But I don't know you. I'm Les's friend. Jeez. Looks like you're a little out of practice. I know people who can help I kept my word and I did help Aanya to carry out Les's wishes. Sign that for me please. And now I can finally enjoy my retirement... knowing that I was right all along. Thank you. Have a good day. Anya did return to India to be with her family. Carol is enjoying her new life. Somewhere in Spain I believe. Holly has done well for herself and is enjoying a successful singing career. However she still knows nothing about the gold. Even though she's receiving it a piece at a time. It's Albert
