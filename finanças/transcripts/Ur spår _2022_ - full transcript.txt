NETFLIX PRESENTS When you have to choose between the winner and loser inside you, always listen to the winner. The loser will never take you where you want to go. Don't give up. Never be satisfied. Don't back down. When difficulties arise, don't forget that now you're writing your own story. Wait, can we stop here? Isn't this timed really badly? "Now you're writing your own story" - over his image? "You're writing your death sentence?" I think it's good. It's about hanging in there for the long run. -Let's take it from the start. -Yep. Kalle, make your voice a little deeper. Think American-action-film trailer. "When you have to choose…" Let's take it again. When you have to choose between the winner and loser, always listen to the winner. -Daniel! -Yeah? -We were going to watch the movie. -Can't we do it later? Later? Later tonight, you mean? That sounds good… This will be gone tomorrow. There's snow now. -Come do it with me. -Yeah, why not? Let me think… No, thanks! This is supposed to be the top post-divorce bar. I've only got 25-year-olds hitting on me. What are they even doing here? Hello! Do you even hear what I'm saying? You think about only one thing. Sex. Sex, sex, sex! -I'm waiting for my order. -Total and then the green button. But if you really want to, we can have sex. It's okay, thanks. And by the way… The post-divorce bar is in there. What the hell are you doing? Take it easy! What the hell, let me go! Go home and go to sleep. What the hell…? What the hell are you doing? -Shit, are you okay? -What's that old lady doing? Come on. Hello! Hello! -Good morning. -What am I doing here? You were sleeping in Berzelii Park. Uh huh. And you go to prison for that? Are we in North Korea or something? Is this how we spend our tax money? Among other things. What time is it? -Ten minutes past seven. -What? Oh shit! Sorry. My daughter has her Lucia concert at 8. Could I get a ride? -Definitely. -Drive me there or something. Nice. I'll bring the limo around. Pole using your abdomen, not your arms. You just need a flick of the triceps at the end… Lock your arms. Push off with your abs, that's where you're strong! -Push off, then quickly back, and again. -"Abs…" You adjust the poles depending on the angle of the track. Lock your arms and push… -Say hi. -Mmm. Hello? Super cool of you. I must have lost my wallet. Frida and I were just having a drink, then it was two, and then… -You know how it goes. -No, I don't. But you can tell me. You need to learn to live a little. You're like a walking advertisement for letting it all hang loose. -Can we get some air in here? -Leave the window alone. Can't you be more responsible? You've got a daughter. What does this have to do with her? You know nothing about kids. You don't even want them. "Why do I, Daniel Nylander, successful IT guy, have a sister who can't even take care of herself?" -I don't know. -So you get to feel even more capable. -It makes you feel good. -Are you my charity case? I'm your Kenya. A little messier and more charming. -Are you aiming for the 1% target? -Can you stop the car? -Daniel. Stop the car! -No, you're not throwing up here! Did it get on the car? -Just a little. -For God's sake! -Hi, Niklas. -Hi, Anders. Do you have a minute? -Is it important? -Something's happened. -Is it Mom? -No, not Mom. Emelie. Emelie? What happened? Emelie is going to be the "Wreath Maiden" for the Vasaloppet. Wow! That's a big deal. Congratulate her from me. The whole family will be at the ceremony. You too, I hope. It may be hard with work. Your job is more important than Emelie awarding the wreath? I didn't think so. We're having coffee with Mom now. We'll talk later. -Say hello to everyone. -Hi, Mom! -I brought this. -How nice! Thank you! All are sleeping, the candles are put out Tipp tapp, tipp tapp tippe tippe tipp tapp tipp, tipp tapp See the gnomes creeping out from the corners from the corners Listening, watching, tiptoeing up tiptoeing up Tipp tapp, tipp tapp tippe tippe tipp tapp tipp, tipp tapp The darkness deepens during advent and our second candle is lit. God, watch over those who weep. Let them smile and play again. Agnes! You sung so beautifully, sweetie! -This is from me. -Thank you. -Hi. -Hi. "To the world's cutest Christmas elf, Hugo." What? Let me see. I told them to write Elvira, and they wrote Hugo. It's not even close. Here. What a useless store. Have you hurt yourself? They've got pastries and yummy things. Don't you want something? -I don't eat sugar. -What? Since when? I'll get 1000 crowns if I don't eat any sugar for a year. I'm your mom and I say that you can have a pastry, if you want, on Lucia. -Come on, Elvira! We're getting sparklers! -Go ahead. Hey, the police called me last night. -What the hell have you done? -I'll just… They wanted to know if our daughter was safe. I maybe had one glass too many. Or two. You know they're making a complaint to Social Services. -A complaint? -Mmm. -There's nothing to worry about. -You're not the one to decide that. That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. Sweetheart, we're going home now. -Pappa said I was going to his house. -He must have misunderstood. Lisa! Shall we do the Christmas decorations? -That looks nice, doesn't it? -Yes. Can you plug it in? -Nice. -Mmm. No! I'll get a new bulb tomorrow. -Maybe a new star, too. -There's nothing wrong with it, is there? It shouldn't be too perfect. -Shall I braid your hair? -Yes! Mom? Mom, wake up! Shit! Fuck! Dammit!! Shit! Fuck! Mom. I'm sorry. It's okay. I love you most of all. You know that, right? Hi, sweetheart. Go jump in the car, I'll be right there. There you go. We'll talk tomorrow. It was just a question of time. The pipe was loose. I'll back you up with Social Services but you have to cooperate. Are you threatening me? Elvira will stay with me until you get things sorted out. And with your girlfriend who put our child on a diet? Does Social Services know that? She's trying to be a good role model. You might try that too. -I am a good role model. -Are you? She doesn't even have her own bed. -Hello! -Hi. Hi. What are you doing? I'm just cleaning up. I don't want Lisa asking a lot of questions. God, she's got a lot of stuff. Hi! Come in! Oh, boy. Yikes. There we go. There. You poor thing! -Daniel said they're taking up the floor. -It's going to take at least three months. -Wow. -Sorry, I know you're sick of me… … but I need to ask for another loan. -"A little messier and more charming." -A loan, Daniel. We'll sort it out somehow. -Fuck, have you eaten? -No. -I just need to pee first. -I can take care of this. Sorry. Okay, I've made the bed and put out towels. You should make yourself at home. Thank you. -Just use what you want, of course. -Okay. Good. Your alcohol consumption, what's that like? Oh, it's normal, I'd say. What happened was a one-time thing. -Do you drink when Elvira is with you? -No. Or, maybe one glass. Not more. -How long have you been unemployed? -I don't know. A few years, maybe. I want to open a foot care salon. I just need to get my grades up. What grades do you need for that? Medical foot care. I did the health program in high school. It's not just trimming toenails. I am able to care for my child. You can't just take her from me. This is a preliminary assessment. We'll reach a decision in two weeks on whether we'll start an investigation. Good morning. How's it going? Oh boy. You had a little party, huh? A Bartolo Mascarello Barolo from '88, not bad. Good choice. Klara got this for her 30th birthday, if I remember correctly. Was it good? It costs about 5,000 crowns. -What? Are you joking? -No. -Not so easy to find, either. -Who has such expensive wine at home? -It was our fault. It was dumb. -Of course, I'll pay for it. We can maybe make a payment plan. -Shit, I'm sorry. -Forget it, it's okay. On one condition. You come skiing with me. -No. -No? -You can borrow Klara's things. -No way. Come on, it's two hours by car. You need to get out of the house. Seriously, no. What else are you going to do? Stay here feeling bad? Have a hair of the dog? Come on! I'm trying to help you. You know that people who compete in races perform better in all aspects of life? You know people who race are completely insane? They're less depressed and live longer. -You're going to love this. -Danne! I need to get my sister sorted out. Go warm up. Don't listen too much to your brother. He's a tyrant! He acts tough but he's mushy on the inside. -Don't destroy my image, now. -Your image? I'm their boss. Remember you need to stay soft. I'm like an old lady with hemorrhoids who's had a spinal fusion. Not sure about the spinal fusion, but the rest is spot on. Fuck you! Think of it as having enormous potential for development. -What the hell is this? It's super steep. -You just snowplow. Like that. Perfect. Be careful, now. Eva's going too. Just do like your sister did. Keep your knees together. -Shit. -Come on. Snowplow! What the hell? Are you okay? How did this happen? -Watch where you're going. -It wasn't on purpose. -These are little kids. -I've got one here, too. I can see that. This was pointless. World's worst idea, Daniel. It gets flatter now, it'll be easier. -No, I'm done. -Are you kidding? -Typical that you take me off a cliff! -Don't just give up. As soon as something is a little hard, you just give up. Stick it out! You need to finish something sometime. Life isn't all downhill with a tailwind! I'm doing the Vasaloppet, it's 90 km. You've done two km and just give up! -Mom? What are you doing here? -Hi! Hi, sweetie. I've been skiing with my brother. It was really nice. -Where's Cesar? -It's just the two of us today. We're teaching Elvira how to slalom. -Oh. -She's so good. Really good, truly. -Really good. -Thanks. -She learns so quickly. -We're going to Sälen for ski break. We managed to get a cabin. It's both ski break and Vasaloppet that week, so it was hard. -Then we'll be there at the same time. -Really? Yes. I'm going. -Vasaloppet. -You are? It's so long. Yep. Nine kilometers. She said "good" every other sentence. You shouldn't tell kids they're good. -They get awful performance anxiety. -Can't you praise them? -Praise? -Yeah. If you had a daughter, she'd be anorexic by the time she was three. You can't tell me I'm good, if I am. -Okay. -You're not allowed to praise me. Focus on how I'm experiencing it and how I'm thinking about it. Got it? If you say so. I didn't think you'd be going again, anyway. I've changed my mind. I'm tagging along. -Tagging along? -Yes, the Vasaloppet. -Vasaloppet. -Yes. It's 90 kilometers. It's in three months. -90 kilometers? Are you joking? -I told you that. There are shorter races you can do. It's good with a carrot. The idea is good, I mean. No, I'm doing the Vasaloppet. I need to pull myself together. You made it two kms today and had a mental breakdown. But I told Elvira I was doing it. -Why did you say that? -Because… -To impress Philippa? -No… -Wasn't it…? -No! -I think it'll be fun. -Yeah, sure. I found you a start position. 1,800 crowns. -Good. -Do you want it? -Yes. -It's a commitment. -I get it. -Hardcore training, every day. -You'll help me, right? -If you promise not to give up. You'll be at that starting line the first Sunday in March, no matter what. And you stop drinking alcohol. Yes, sir! -Buy it! -Okay. You better not back out now. -I love you! -Cut it out. Grandfather would have been so proud of you. You should know that. Carb loading? A little early, maybe. -What do you mean? -You're doing it. -Doing it? -The Vasaloppet. -No. -Yes. You're not getting out of it. -Someone has to go with Mom. -She's not doing it, is she? One year till she's a veteran, and you think she's stopping? -She's had heart failure. -That's why she can't do it alone. -You can go. -Are you kidding? I'm focusing 100% on Emelie this year. Filming, supporting her, making sure nothing goes wrong. Maybe you think Johan should go? With his torn Achilles tendon. Maybe she shouldn't do it at all. Johan and I have all the responsibility while you're down in Stockholm. -Same thing when Dad got sick. -Who's sick? Johan and his Achilles tendon. I'm going with you this year, Mom. -I'm not a child. -I want to do it with you. May I? I won't wait for you. Good. -Is it okay Lisa will be coming along? -I don't know what I'm supposed to say. You sold it as a romantic weekend with a little skiing. I booked an extra room for her. Okay. Daniel… It's too close. Abstinence for 48 hours. -We can be a little naughty. -No, we can't. Okay. We need to have top quality for tomorrow. Tomorrow. Tomorrow? -Tomorrow, yes. You haven't forgotten? -No, no. We'll do a few laps to warm up first. IVF CLINIC TODAY 3.00 PM Okay. Come on! That's good! Great! Where's Danne? No… No… -Hello? -Where are you? I'm stuck in a meeting. -Are you kidding? -I'll sort it out. -I seriously hope so. -Hello? You want me to put that down my pants? Yes. It's important that it stays at body temperature. -And then I take it to your wife. -Yes. That would be awesome. I'll pay extra, of course. -I'll do it for a thousand. -Yes, okay. Yes. My wife will pay you. Get it right down there. And don't take it out until you're there. -What do you think I'd do with it? -Take my ID, so she knows you're me. -What? -I mean, you're you. But it's me who… -Got it. -Cool. Thanks. Okay, one more lap. Then we'll do intervals. -Ready. Turn. Turn. -Perfect. Nice! -Klara? -Yes? Your husband has sent the sperm with him, but Daniel needs to identify himself. -There. -By the way, here's the stuff. -I'll take it. -You need to pay me, too. -Are you a complete idiot? -Why? You didn't want to tell anyone what we're going through, right? But you think it's fine to use some random taxi driver as a sperm-mobile? How am I to know it wouldn't be him I'd be having a kid with? At the moment, that seems like a better idea. Listen to me! In 20 minutes, they're taking out my eggs and you'll be here with a fresh batch! -I've got to go. -Where the hell are you going? -Daniel! -We'll talk later! What the hell…? Please come with me. We'll get going in five minutes. We have fifteen eggs. That's really good, Klara. -And the sperm? -We have enough. I wanted to ask about the low motility… Can that have an effect? Daniel works out an extreme amount. -And his clothes are tight. -They have enough, she said. -Why are you bringing this up now? -I've read that it can have an effect. In Family Life, right? No, I think it was in Dagens Nyheter. Or maybe some scientific site. -Family Life. -Okay, Daniel, it was in Family Life. What should I do, when I'm not allowed to talk to my friends? Don't listen to group guesses by poorly educated hypochondriacs. I hope you hear how you sound. Cooks are said to be overrepresented, they're standing by hot stoves all day. Maybe I cook too much? Can it be that? We have enough, so you don't need to think about it. We'll see how many embryos we can get. See you on Wednesday. -Thanks very much. -Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas. Oh my God, are you okay? -Record. Record… -Congratulations. Merry Christmas, then. Merry Christmas. -Thanks for the gift card. -You're welcome. What movie will you go see? You can see whichever you want. Whichever I want? -Yes. The ones from age 7, of course. -Elvira! -I have to go eat. -Say hi to Pappa. Merry Christmas. -Mom says hi. -Merry Christmas! -Merry Christmas! -See you tomorrow, sweetie. -Fight! -Oh, fuck. -Nice! -Oh, fuck. What are you experiencing? What are your thoughts around it? -Shut up! -Vasaloppet is 56 more laps like that. On the Vasaloppet, you can stop for coffee. No, let go. Motivation doesn't come for free. You have to fight for it. -Do you understand what I'm saying? -Yes. -I can't hear you. -Yes! Let's go. You're strong. Right? You're feeling strong, right? One embryo. Under the circumstances, I think it's pretty good. But since you haven't been feeling so good, Klara, and I saw your abdomen is quite swollen, we want to wait to implant it. Okay. So we'll freeze it? We'll freeze it and wait one or two ovulation cycles. Why is she so bloated? -I'm overstimulated, Daniel. -It's a risk that you will be. I want to at least start talking about adoption. I don't want to talk about adoption. We have an embryo, can we focus on that? -I think this looks nice. -You're like a master chef. -So true. Really delicious. -The celery root puree was fantastic. So good. Good thing I can eat for two. -When are you due? -Two months to go. -Some wine? -No, I'm fine. -Are you pregnant too? -No. More lacking limits. You're slaying the Vasaloppet. I've seen it myself. We also have something to…announce. What's that? -Are you joking? -No. -You are, too? -It's very early on, but yes. -Congratulations. -Thanks! You're such a stud, Jensa. Have you not heard that the earth is overpopulated? Four kids? -Five, actually. -Five? -It's twins! -No, seriously? -No, it's true. -Don't feel any pressure! -We don't want kids. -We can't have kids. That's how it is. We're trying. We've been trying for a few years. With insemination, IVF, everything. Yes… That's our situation. -I'm sorry to hear that. -Sorry, I didn't mean… There's no way you'd have known. But we are, of course, very happy for you. Thanks. Right, darling? Of course. We actually have a… We have an embryo. In the freezer. So… So we're hopeful. How exciting. That's how it is. -Anyway, cheers! -Here's to a fantastic dinner. Cheers! Cheers. It's almost time, huh? The hour. …six, five, four, three, …two, one. Happy New Year! -Happy New Year, Sis. -Yes. -Happy New Year, Jensa! -Good New! Why didn't you say anything? I could have helped out, been a surrogate mother, or something. Or maybe it's not allowed if you're siblings. It may be a little risky. Shall we get going? We'll take four times up and four down. -Watch out. -Shit! You need to really watch out here. What am I doing here? Why didn't you stop me? Come on. Let's go! Here we go! Go, go go! Why are you so fucking fast? Lisa, we've decided to open an investigation. I understand that this is really hard for you. What did Cesar say? I understand that Elvira is often late to school when she's with you. But I live far from the school. If she comes at all. She's absent a lot during your weeks. She's been sick. Cesar claims that Elvira has been anxious lately. Feeling low and often has a stomachache. She has not. That's not at all correct. Please, don't open an investigation. I'm doing much better. I'm sorry but this is the overall picture. I've started working out, I've stopped drinking… I'm doing the Vasaloppet. -You're doing the Vasaloppet? -Yes, I'm doing it. Really? I'm doing the Vasaloppet too. -Oh… -For the fourth time. I did Open Track before but now I'll do the real one. How many times have you done it? -This is my first time. -First time? Good! It was like she was seeing me in a whole new light. It was crazy. It's like a sect. Hello? -Yes, a sect. -Make me work hard when I get home. -Yes, I promise. -I'm going to show them, dammit. Hi! -You're looking well. -Thanks. Carina Larsson. Hi, this is Daniel Nylander. Klara is on speaker. -We missed a call from… -Great that you called back. I'm afraid I have bad news. The embryo didn't survive being thawed. You'll need to take some time to think about how you want to proceed. You don't have to decide anything now. We can talk next week. -We'll be in touch. Bye. -Bye. -We're never having a child. -It's not too late yet. You're 40. You could be fertile for at least four more years. Twelve ovulations per year. That's 48 chances, at least. I can't do math right now. I just want a child. I know. I want a child, too. -I'm sorry. -No… Darling… Will you call the hotel? -Why? -To cancel the reservation. No, why would we…? What do you mean, why? We can't go up there now. -Are you a robot? -No, I'm not. But I… We knew we were doing an implantation and that it might not go well. I'm staying home. I just can't. Hey, come on. I've been training for a year, Klara. I've brought in people from work, my sister is doing it. I'm also sad about this. -This was our last chance. -No. -Yes, it was. -Stop it. -All of this is because of you. -I know that. -I think you should be more engaged. -I am engaged. -Really? I don't see it. -I'm saying we shouldn't give up. You say that. But it's not you who has to fill your body with hormones! You can't even make it to the clinic, you send a taxi driver! I've apologized for that. I'd take the hormones if I could but I can't. -What do you want me to do? Stop living? -You can be so stupid. Don't walk away! You can't stop living because you're trying to have a baby! I haven't said you should stop living. -But you have. -I have?! It's all you think about. We can't go there, we can't do that. It's just baby, baby all the time! You're obsessed by it! -God damn you. -God damn you. If your sperm weren't so shit we wouldn't even be in this situation! Don't forget that! -Isn't Klara coming? -I told you. She's not feeling well. You know, it can be good to hear that you also have hard times. I'll remember that. Let's go. -Hello, this is Klara. -This is Wilma, Högfjäll Hotel in Sälen. Hello. We're overbooked because of the Vasaloppet. So I just want to confirm your booking: One suite and a double room. -You can cancel the suite. -Sorry, what did you say? You can cancel it. -So we can cancel your reservation? -Yes. Thanks, bye. -Blue or purple. -How cold will it be? Minus 3, they say. -Are you nervous? -I'm in mortal terror. It's your fault. You sadist. Hey, cheers for Danne who's the best coach I know. -The best. -Cheers. Did she get snus? -Oh, hi. -Hi. Haven't we met? No, I don't think so. -Oh no, you're not a celebrity? -No, I'm not a celebrity. I've heard I look like Martin Stenmarck, but… -No, not at all. -No… He's really hot, but not my type. -But you look like someone. -Yes… -That may be. -Yes. "You look like someone else, just not as handsome." I just can't… -I'm going to buy some fruit. -Now? We're about to leave. -I want fruit. -Five minutes! The car key! -Don't you have it? -Me? No, I don't have the key. -I just had it. -You're not serious? -How did you manage that? -Lay off! Look for it instead. I leave you alone for five minutes! What is wrong with you? -I didn't do it on purpose. -Regardless, we still have no key! You don't give a shit, with your daughter, too. "What's happening? No idea." -Is this what you want? -To stand here freezing? -To do the Vasaloppet. -Of course I do. I dropped a key, big fucking deal. -It must be in here. -I'm calling road assistance. -Do you have to be such an asshole? -My name is Daniel Nylander. We've lost the key to my car. -Okay. What do you want? -Isn't that…? -Shit, Lisa?! -What is she doing? Is she drunk? Good God… Let's leave. We're leaving. Here! I found it! Here. Take it. -What's the name on the booking? -Nylander, Daniel. Your booking was canceled earlier today. No, that's not right. I booked a double room a year ago. -It's been canceled. -You have to book another room. I'm afraid it's fully booked. We can offer a place to sleep in a school, a ways away. I can give you sheets. -You can give me sheets? Is this a joke? -Daniel. I'm supposed to sleep on the floor in a school before skiing 90 kilometers? -The others there will be, too. -They're maybe not aiming at the top 500! -It was Klara! -You think Klara did this? Fucking dammit! -Shall we take numbers? -Yes. Nice. -I'm going to call Elvira. -Okay. I'll walk around and try to find Jens and Björn. Can you take this? -Hi Mom! -Hi, sweetie. You doing well? -Yes. How are you? -I'm doing really well. -What a nice hat. Did Pappa buy that? -No, Philippa knitted it. -She's knitting for the baby all the time. -For the baby? Can I talk to Mom? Sweetie, take your things. -Hi, Lisa. -You're having a baby? Yeah, I was going to tell you. -But Elvira got there first. -It's not so far along. -How far along is it? -Four months. Five. I thought you didn't want more kids. No, I didn't think so either. Lisa, I really didn't mean for it to… Not like this. I'm sorry. No, I … Sorry, I have to go. I either ignore how tired I'm feeling and count the pole plants or else I focus entirely on sensory signals. I feel how fatigued my muscles are, and focus on my breathing. -This is Danne. Naomi. -Hi. You're the one who roped in your employees so they can see how good you are? Yeah, I suppose so. Nice to meet you. I'm a big fan. Daniel. I avoid other people's germs the day before a race. Of course. -Are you also in lane 5, like these guys? -Lane 2. -How about you? -Same. -Who do you think I look like? -What?… I don't know. Take a guess. -Nils on the Ridge? -No. Jack Sparrow. -Can I buy you a drink? -Does your mother know you're here? Who do you think I look like? -Can I have a pint and a Jäger? -Absolutely. -Shall we go to bed? -Yes, that's probably best. I need to wait for my sister. Okay. Sleep tight. -Nice to meet you. -Good night. Good luck! How many kilometers have you done? Forty on roller skis, forty on snow. What about you? -150 on the track. -Okay. That's good. -Hi. -Hi. I've remembered where we met. Did you make it to your daughter's Lucia concert? I'm a police officer. We met when you slept at the station. Here you go. That'll be 210, thanks. -I didn't order this. -A beer and a Jäger. -A glass of milk, I said. -Come on. -Just joking. Thanks. -Funny. Excuse me. Sorry if I was rude. This is on Mrs. Sparrow. -Have you done it before? -Yes, a long time ago. Once. Do you know which track you should take on the first hill? No. Go left at the house. It's a little longer but it's more open. -Everyone keeps to the right. -Which house…? -Shall I show you? -Yes, please. -I have a snowmobile outside. -Okay, a snowmobile? I'm skiing with my mom. She's aiming to be a veteran. -Veteran? -Yes. -That's when you've done it 30 times. -Shit… -She's very competitive. -Are you, too? No. There's really only one race I want to do. It's called the Marathon du Médoc. -Have you heard of it? -No. You run between different vineyards. Castles and all that. At the hydration stations, you taste wines. You might get oysters and goose liver… You get it. That sounds nice. -But I think I'm more of a hot dog person. -I probably am, too. We'll have to create a race where you run between different hot dog stands. -Yes. -Chocolate milk tasting… Daniel! Where are you going? We're just going to look at something. I'll be maybe 15 minutes. -Who's that? -Naomi. I'll be back. See you. -There. Go on the outer side. You see? -So, to the left. -It's much calmer. Fewer people. -Okay. I got it. Want to see where I'm staying tonight? Sure. Or, where are you staying? It's an old shepherd's hut my family has. I stay there before the race, it's lucky. Yes, definitely. Let's go! -He's not answering. -Oh, yeah? -I can walk with you, if you want. -Police escort for defenseless woman? Just so you don't end up in a park somewhere. Really funny… Wow! -Cozy. -It was built in the 1700s. It was still in use when my mom was little. Cool instruments. They were used to call the animals if you couldn't "kula." -What's that? -It's a voice technique. -It's unique. -Is it like another language? More like a way of calling, you could say. In falsetto. It can be commanding, or exciting. Can you do it? -Only when I come. -Oh… What do you do otherwise? When you're not doing the Vasaloppet. Apart from hanging out in the drunk tank and in trash containers? Exactly. Well…I'm unemployed after being on sick leave for depression. Okay. I must come off as the world's most depressing person. Unemployed, on sick leave, depressed… I've also secretly smoked cigarettes under my kitchen exhaust fan. -Is this your Tinder profile? -Yes. I've been single for the last six months so I was able to really focus this time. My ex was always complaining I spent too much time training. That can take its toll. He wanted to sit home, watch TV and eat tacos. And have kids. I don't even want kids. -No? -I like my freedom too much. I want to be able to up and go where I want, when I want. Climbing in the summer, hiking in the fall, skiing in the winter. It feels a little weird to be sitting here talking to you. I follow you on social media and have read all your posts, and all. -And now you're sitting here. -That must feel strange. I realize I'm sounding like a stalker weirdo. I didn't mean it that way, sorry. It might turn me on. Okay. So this is where I'm staying, along with fifty awesome dudes. Maybe a few not so awesome ones, I don't know. -You want me to check them out? -Nah, I've got pepper spray. I didn't hear that… But you can sleep at my place if you want. Or with my mother. She lives just over there. Thanks, that's nice of you. But I don't think my brother would forgive me if I left him here alone. I understand. -But thanks for the company. -Thank you, too. -And good luck tomorrow. -Yeah, shit. You too. Sleep well. No pepper spray, okay? -No, I promise. -It's illegal possession of a weapon. If anyone gets handsy, I'll stick a pole up their ass. Okay. Good night! -Where the hell have you been? -I've hardly got any signal. -Naomi's letting me stay here. -I'm sorry? I mean, I can't sleep on the floor. Are you joking? You're just going to leave me here? Leave you?… Hello? -Hello? -Are you there? Police! Stop! Can I change my mind? Yes, of course. Hello, you've reached Daniel Nylander. Leave a message after the beep. I'd never be intimate with someone the night before a race, so you know. -Not even a kiss. -No, no, I understand, absolutely. But I've booked a private jacuzzi at the Högfjäll Hotel's spa for right after the race. If you'd like to join me. I'm going to enjoy everything I've denied myself, before I start training again. That sounds like a good plan. I'd like that. -Do you always meet before the race? -Yes, it's a tradition. How long have you been together? Us? No, we're not… -Lisa is… We're just friends. -Yes. -Like that woman… Katrin? -Give it a rest. You met her very soon after your divorce. Very soon. Can I get the cheese? -You were also only friends? -Yes. I feel good. Åsa is asking how Mom is feeling about the race tomorrow. Are you nervous? Why would I be nervous? My performance would suffer. That's true. I'll remember that. Play the game, roll with the punches. Thanks for dinner. Someone is nervous. I understand it's prestigious to be the Wreath Maiden. -Is that true, dear? -I think so. Both Charlotta and Mom have been Wreath Maidens. Isn't it a woman who awards the wreath to the men, -and the opposite for the women? -That's right. Doesn't that feel a little gender normative? I'm thinking if the winner is gay. Maybe they'd want it to be given by someone of the same sex. True. It's just a thought. Exciting. I forgot to ask if you have to be from Dalarna to be the Wreath Maiden. Okay. Wouldn't it be nice if they'd chosen an immigrant? I'll talk to my mother, she's on the Vasaloppet board. A trans activist from Afghanistan with a disability, maybe? It's important, I think, not to be too boastful. Absolutely. We'd never be that… Is that your father? Yeah. -Is he… -He's dead. -He died ten years ago. -Were you close? Nah. He wasn't really close to anyone. Let me show you where you're sleeping. -It's not exactly a hotel suite. -It's perfect. Thanks for making me think about something other than the race. It was the only thing we talked about. But all this -it gives perspective. You do the best you can. There's no point comparing yourself to everyone else. Says the one who's competing in a ski race with 15,000 participants. Yes, but I don't think about it like that. I'm competing against myself. That's a cliché. I'll be competing against you, I can say that much. Okay. May the best man win, then. Yes. Or woman. Or transgender person. Okay. Have you seen the girl who has that spot? -No one slept there last night. -Okay. Thanks. Thanks for the ride. And thanks for… Maybe we'll see each other on the track. Yes. Or… I don't know. I'm skiing with my mom, so… She's fast for her age but I hope we get stopped at the first rope. -What do you mean, rope? -The rope. They rope off the track at a certain time. Those who aren't through by then have to stop, whether they want to or not. I was thinking I would… Did you not know about that? -No. -It'll go great. -Good luck. -Mm-hmm I wanted to say something. I'm not really ready to… start dating and all that. -My life is pretty chaotic right now. -Okay. -Speaking of roping off? -Yeah… Like here, but not further. -Or… -I get it. -There you are. -Where have you been? -Did Klara get a hold of you? -No. The reception was bad. She's called and texted me. Should I tell her you were with the shepherd's hut girl? -I'll get in touch with her. -What are you doing? And you took off your ring? Yes, I did. -I always do that for competitions. -I see. I get blisters from it. It's a fight to get a good start position in the Vasaloppet. A good start position is decisive for how quickly you get to Mora. A thorough seeding process makes the determination… I don't think Klara and I can be together anymore. What? I've been her therapist more than her husband for the last few years. What I felt with Naomi yesterday… We connected on a whole other level. -You've known her for twelve hours. -It feels like my whole life. I could move up here. Open a training facility or something. I can ski in the winter, go climbing in the summer, parachute in the spring. Are you always this wobbly before a competition? It's not about the competition. It just become crystal clear. I'll talk to Klara when I get home. We'll get a divorce. We should have long ago. You and Klara have been together for 15 years. You're throwing that away because you met some 25-year-old snow bunny? -You're such a cliché. -Naomi is 32. -She works as a sports instructor. -Oh well, never mind. Go for it. We're going to be really late. Excuse me, can you open the back door? -I'm getting out here, too. -What? You're leaving me? We were doing this together. You're in start position ten. Call when you're done. -What does that matter? -You've got this. Really uncool! -Hi, Mom! -Hi, Sweetie! Are you up? -Where are you? -On the way to the starting line. -Will you come and watch? -I think so. I'm sorry things have been such a mess lately, but all that is over now. I'll get a job and the apartment will be finished. It'll be great. -Okay. -Alright, silly thing. Kisses! -There! I felt a kick. -It's a little early. Are we not going to watch the Vasaloppet? I thought we'd go up to the top and eat waffles. It'll be really nice. Elvira, there are thousands of people. It would be really hard to find Mom. -What if we go to where they finish? -We'll see. You know how Mom is. She says lots of things but they don't turn out. The race is really long, I don't think Mom will even finish. There! Now! Feel it! Yes! Blueberries -Damn it… -Take it easy! -Coming through. -Watch out! -Go to the back where you belong. -Yeah, funny! Announcement for all travelers to Mora, departure time 07:44. The train is delayed. New departure time is at 09:14. Excuse me! Can you take me to Mora, in Dalarna? -I get off in an hour, sorry. -Thanks anyway. -Could you take me to Dalarna? -Dalen, no problem. -No, to Dalarna. -Dalarna, is that like, 1000 km? -Not that far… -Where do you want to go? -Oh, hello. It's you! -Hi… -Remember me? I was the one who… -Yes, right. -How did it go with that? -Not so well, unfortunately. -Sorry to hear that. -Yes. -Where are you going? -I'm going to Dalarna. -Dalarna? -To Mora. -Hop in. -Are you sure? Okay. Long time since I was in Mora. Go for it, Irma! In 90 kilometers, you'll be a veteran! Naomi! -Let's do it! -Yes! And so we're unleashing this herd of skiers. This nuclear power plant of energy. The energetic cascade of color heads off for the challenge of a lifetime. I can report that traffic in Sälen is sitting still. But that doesn't matter, we're having a great time together! Vasaloppet… Do you ski? No. I have, a little, but not so much anymore. Not me either. Or, I should say, I haven't skied in a long time. I'm more into football. I've trained Bajen's 13 year olds. -That keeps you busy, I guess. -You know it. Some of them are focused and do exactly what they're told. Others just run around and chase each other. The important thing is that they have fun together. Not mess around and kick each other. You have to tell them what's what. Absolutely. You know, I really need to be there latest by 1. Will we make it? Oh, yeah. It'll ease up soon. Elvira? Elvira! Elvira! -She's not here. -What? Elvira! -Elvira! -Call her. Turned off. -She can't have got far. -It's really cold out. Good job! -What the hell are you doing? -Watch out! -You okay? -Idiot. -Sorry. I apologize. -Come on, Daniel! Forget about him! I'm not gliding at all! -Mom! -See you at home. Shit! Your guy will be happy you're there to cheer him on. -I hope so. Does he not know you're coming? I can't get a hold of him. So you jump in a taxi and drive up? Well, well, that is love! That's romance. It's maybe a little more complicated than that. My old lady and I, we tried to have kids for a very long time. Several years, we were trying. Or my ex-wife, I should say. -She got remarried six months ago. -Because you couldn't have kids? No, no. That was a long time ago. She met someone else. The guy who owns the hardware store where we live. -That's awful. -These things happen. You can't control everything in life. But I buy tools somewhere else now. I like carpentry. I … said really… …cruel things to him. And now he's not answering. So I don't know. Okay. We'll see. If my wife came back and told me she loved me, and said she was sorry, I'd forgive her straight away. -You would? -Yes. Straight away. Life isn't a straight path. There are ups and downs. The whole nine yards. Just like the Vasaloppet! -Don't you think? -Yes. It'll be okay. Klara: Surprise! What? -What are you doing? -I need to pee, go ahead. You do it in your suit. I'll be waiting in the jacuzzi! Hurrah, hurrah! You need to save your strength. There are 85 km to go. Get behind me so you can keep a good pace. -Where's Anders? -He wasn't properly waxed . Goddamn Lisa! It'll be okay. Honey, we'll find her. -Shit, shit, shit, shit! -Shall we drive down that little road? Where is she? Sweetheart, you can't walk here. It can be dangerous. There are lots of cars. Where's your mom and dad? -Mamma is skiing. -Get on the bus and warm up. Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! The final push. This year's winner of the Vasaloppet, Geir Lippestad! Go, Emelie! Nice! Congratulations, Geir! An amazing performance. The winning time… The Vasaloppet has a winner. Lippestad finished in 3 hours, 57 minutes… -Did they say someone finished? -Yes, the winner just finished. How is that even possible? It's not human. -He's Norwegian. -Let's go. Pastry? Off track! Where do you want me to drop you? As close to the finish as possible. If you can. No problem. Look. We're passing the boss. How's it going? -Everything okay? -Oh, yeah. You sure? -I just had this funny feeling. -Feeling? -Take it easy. We're off. -Go for it. I'll be along. You're losing speed. You'll have to carry on by yourself. Okay! Thanks, Irma! I'd not have made it this far without you! Just be careful on Risbergs Hill. People break their arms and legs there. What hill is that? Look at the one in black! Back at it! -Shit. Are you okay? -I think so. -You're not hurt? -No. Good. Damn it, my mother purposefully waxed my skis so I don't glide. -Are you kidding? -No. She wants to do it by herself. She just took off. We're almost halfway, let's go. Let's do this! Are you okay? Hey, are you all right? Hello, are you okay? Oh, okay… I need help up here! Medics! -I don't know what's happening. -How are you feeling? -It's okay. -I don't think so. Oh hell, they're pulling the rope. We've got to go, come on! Hurry! Wait, we're coming! No! No, no. -Sorry, it's for safety reasons. -Come on, be cool. -It's the same rules for everyone. -You don't know what she's been through. Really well done, but now it's over. Let us through, okay? Otherwise, you've got real problems. -Good, thanks. Come on. -You watch yourself. More and more skiers on the way in to the finish. Torbjörn Eklöf, congratulations to you. Jörgen Holmberg… I don't understand, according to this he's standing still. Did he lose the chip? Let me see. Björn Lundqvist and Jens Gren, Lidingö, side by side. Hi! -Yes! -Well done! Congratulations! Hi. You're here? Do you know where Daniel is? He looks like he's stuck in Oxberg. -I don't know, but he was spent. -Do you think he's injured? -I don't know. -We can go there and check. Are you sure? You don't need to go back to Stockholm? I don't need anything. Come on! -Yes, sure. -You're welcome to come to Vansbro, also. Where's the boss? -We were starting to wonder. -He seemed to be feeling bad. I won't wait for him all night. Tell him that. -Holy shit. -Pretty much. -Okay, let's go. -Okay. Come on. No, no, no… Mom! Mom. Hi, Mom. Hey… -What happened? Is everything okay? -Lisa, I'm going with her. -Okay. I hope it'll be okay. Who was that? What are you doing here? I thought you'd finished ages ago. -Klara is waiting in Mora. -What? I don't know what to do. Come on, Daniel. Everyone's got problems. You'll sort this out. -I don't know what to do. -You can start by admitting it's hard. You can't just sweat away all your feelings. What am I supposed to do, lie down and feel sorry for myself? -Yeah, maybe. -Drink myself into a stupor. I'm not going to suffocate in self pity. Life is not a competition you're supposed to win. You'll end up like his mother. -Forget it, I can't do this. I'm leaving. -Where are you going now? I don't know. Just somewhere else! No, that's enough. Are you going to subject yourself to this torture for another 40 kms? Or go drink hot chocolate in a warm bus? I choose the bus. What about you? This is pointless. Gustav Vasa was fighting for his life. But our salvation is over there. Fucking shit wax!!! -Never again! -What the hell are you doing, you old cow? -What the hell did you throw on me? -What are you doing? Want some? No, I'm going to keep going. Seriously? Hi, everyone, this is Torgny, your driver. I did the Vasaloppet 30 years in a row, and ended up each time on the bus. Fall apart and pull yourself together. Enjoy the warmth. Mom! Mom! Hello! Hello, little one. What do you think I should do? Hmm? Hello? This is nuts. Look -it's moving. He's here somewhere. Out in the middle of the forest? Excuse me. There's someone missing, can you help us? -A skier? -Yes, his name is Daniel Nylander. -Has he passed by here? -I've no idea. -Can't you see it, if he's gone by? -Unfortunately not. Look -he's here. But I can't find him. Ask the manager, then. -Hop up. -What? Hop up. Hurry, now. What the hell? Get back here! Police! Police… There you go. Shit. Shit! Hello!! Help! Hello! Hello! Wait, wait! I can't see him anymore. -Daniel! -Hello? Hello! Help! -There! Daniel! -Klara! I'm here! Daniel. Are you okay? What are you doing here? I just wanted to… I wanted to say I'm sorry. I'm sorry! -I should have stayed home. -No. I should have come with you. Tell him you love him. Do it. -What's he doing here? -The gracious lady needed a ride, so… -You took a taxi from Stockholm? -Yes. What are we doing? I don't know. You tell me. I don't know. I chase you up here, I chase down your sperm. I think we… I think we need to reconsider. Take a break from each other. I don't know. What do you think? I think I'm freezing my balls off. Well, we've never had any joy from them, anyway. Good job! There's only a little way left to go. You're the only one left. We'll follow you to the finish. Well done! The last skier, Lisa Nylander, is on her way in. Fantastic, here she comes, maybe! Here she is! Lisa Nylander! The real heroine of this race! The last skier has crossed the finish in Mora! What a fighter! 12 hours and 20 minutes, she's been on her skis today. Such an achievement, such fighting spirit! You should be very proud of what you've done. I think the crowd can help out for these last few meters! Come on! Hurrah! Hurrah! Oh boy! Congratulations, Lisa! There she is! Mom! -Mom! -Hello! -Mom, did you win? -It almost feels that way. You did it! Good job, Lisa! 27,000 views. People make careers from that sort of thing. Sometimes you just have to throw yourself into things. Good. We're done here. Your case is closed. I wish you the best of luck. Thanks. Come in! -Hello! -Hello. So… So, Daniel, I… I was at the gynecologist. Okay. There were just checking everything was okay. Okay, but… was there something wrong? They discovered that I… I'm pregnant. 14 weeks. So… It must have been just before you went up to Sälen. I'm pregnant! How… -Look at the photo, it looks so strange. -Those don't look like toes. -It looks like meat. -That's been cut off here. Okay. This is the tarus. This is the metatarus. Tarsus. Metatarsus, I mean. And this is the… -That tickles! -It does? MARATHON DU MÉDOC. HUGS FROM ANDERS. P.S. MOM IS DOING FINE AND SAYS HELLO Mom, there's a police car out there. Subtitle translation by: Stephanie Lindqvist
