What did I say and what did you do? Will you not do what is said? Sir Why do you still see so, go It seems lunch time is up for Registrar sir and is saying to leave Oh no, how now brother? You do not take tension dear, why am I here? I said you are close to me and asked to wait for some time and he said ok He is of the type leaving the marriage too in middle if it is one, goes home and is back after eating We are giving you great trouble brother Nothing so dear, I respect Ramakrishna so much Look son, you may be wondering why I respect your father so much He did not touch even one rupee working from 25 years in the Corporation. That is the loyalty. Respect is not like Aadhar card given to all. It comes only when having eligibility like a Credit card What do you say? Yes Yes, I saw you about 13 years back. You were very thin and lean You are now very strong That is uncle, I am Subbu and Karthik is outside That means, are you not son of Ramakrishna Sir? That is... He too is just like my son, brother. Both grew together from childhood You go and get him Ok, I will just be back I thought he is the bride groom Are mom and others getting any tensed? I called dude, she would be on the way and why tension? I am very happy dude, I can still see the childhood days before my eyes What is a marriage so fast for you? Hey, I will go and say mom that Anjali is arrived What happened? I called you many times. I got tensed as you did not lift the call. Ok, it is already late and let us go. Mom, see she is come I do not like this marriage, Karthik Hey, you be talking and we will wait inside What to wait sir? Are you getting the girl married without her wish? Sir, you come this way. I will say everything like you understand after going in, ok What more will you say? To send your son abroad to America, you get the girl married to him without her wish? Please do not shout Thank God, she said it here If she had said that in before the Registrar, he would have slippered me to have done the mediation between you What baby, are you happy now? He quit his job saying to leave for America with you. You made him stand on the road, who never gave a chance for anyone to insult. Will you stop for a while mom? I am seeing her from the childhood, son She does not like you getting better. Not for your marriage with her, but a fear what would happen to you Mom please Anjali, you leave and I will take care Hey Dambu, she has to go too far. You go, drop her Hey, have you still not get the shame? I am saying, she would get married within a year And you crazy like this, still keep believing her? Listen to me Karthik. Karthik! I am going to US by tomorrow night flight Do you not have anger on me? Liking when you are near me and feeling sad when being away... I do not know anything else than that Anjali Will any time or distance keep you hidden? Will any wound or silence change me? Will you not come back to this place, never being able to forget? Will those forgotten not come back leaving the sorrow? I am driving away, leaving though burnt and shattered in any anger No idea what medicine is in these relations, this love is bouncing high again so Will you not come back to this place, never being able to forget? Will those forgotten not come back leaving the sorrow? What, VISA interview it seems? It seems you should leave in a week if you get, right?

Ok madam That was an unforgettable day of my life The day of seeing Anjali for the first time When the drop is fallen like the cut down star Came walking straight is the dazzling Goddess Time has moved and the speed has gone Whole earth shook under the feet Eyes have floated with lids becoming the wings It felt like a tickling to the heart Unbearable happiness to the lip without even a mustache A doubt of having a new birth every second A sweet feeling with no words coming out A joy not enough even for a thousand poems Hey, Sir you are right here How did you get wet in the rain? There was a lightening just now and I went to the wall for observing why the thunder has still not fallen I got wet that time sir Are you testing the nature, idiot? Not to the wall but go and stand in the ground. The thunder would directly fall and we will get a relief, You idiot... Go.

Project manager is coming from US Those who like can work and the rest can quit Looks like this is a good chance Yes Follow as I say Ok. Ok? Ok... Ok bro Let's move. You should hike the salary for us to work sir You should have shame to say that Recently while in discussion with our watchman Buchibabu, when the salary topic came, I understood that just a difference of 2000 is in between us both I somehow feel his salary is more in 2000 too Look, you do not talk about the salary. Wind blows as per the tree size You do not talk about the work... Result is based on the pay You said to give even life for the Company when you came for the interview?

I never felt as important to anyone till then, but that day was different About Karthik, I liked his attention for me more than him. He is coming in search of me to see me again. I feel so special Still, a crazy school boy studying 9th class... Why did I like? Maybe I too was a crazy school girl studying 9th class then Who felt like a woman for the first time Eyes floated with lids becoming like the wings It felt like a tickling to the heart A happiness unbearable for the heart A doubt of taking new birth every second A sweet feeling with no words coming out A joy not enough even for a thousand poems This story was written at that time when there was very little need to protect the environment and the wild life Now we are just awake. The Government of India... Hey, what are you seeing? Look into the book Silence Though many changes come in the human body, it is only the eyes which do not change till 13 years If you see the diagram, center part of the...

He will feel very bad What happened, have you failed? No Karthik, I got 9th rank. I always used to come first. Now getting such marks, I am frightened what daddy would say You know one thing? I till date do not know what a rank is I always used to fail three subjects and now I failed all the subjects Still, time is not enough in your house for your dad and mom to fight and what would they bother about you? I will not stay calm if you say another word about mom and dad What are you going high? Shall I say you another thing? I heard when my parents were talking. Do you know that your mom and dad are getting separated? No problem when they fight and now an objection when I say I hate you Karthik, I hate you Dambu... Hey Dambu Do not shout, I am coming Hey, did you go home? No, I am going. Why? Hey, Principal sir came to know everything about you both He called parents of you both and spoke something What did he speak? No idea, I too do not know But, both your dad and dad of Anjali had a big fight and came out shouting from the room of Principal Sir Hey, what work do you have with that dirty vagabond? Come up Grandma, do you know how to sign? Why? I am wishing to marry and thought you would sign as the witness You idiot... You will not get shame how many ever times you are scolded You need a marriage now, idiot? Hey Subbu, come up taking that tumbler Hey, are you not afraid at all? I am very much frightened, see how are my hands shivering My dad today would really get me married I am feeling worried thinking even Anjali would be the same frightened Ok, you go Hey, where are you going? I just said something to Anjali. Maybe she is feeling sad Hey, are you any crazy? It is fine if you get hit by your dad. But why do you wish to go and get hit by her dad? Hey, nothing will happen Why are you talking like you know everything? At least say what is going to happen. I will have no tension I unnecessarily made Anjali just cry. I will go and say her sorry, bye Karthik, stop dude. Listen to me... Karthik What is your age? What is your age? Your school Principal called and said to debar you and that no chance to write the exams I wished to request saying she would do better as you may have got less marks But what he told was something I did not expect. Say what answer should I give Anjali? Answer me Who is that fellow, always roaming around our house? No anger right? Sorry Anjali, I just said something... This idiot... Come inside Karthik What is your age Karthik? Oh, good... Even Anjali said the same Look Karthik, it would be listen that my daughter at 14 is preparing for IIT, got a cup in sports or got first at the school And if we get to listen that she is moving around with some boy at 14, it sounds very bad I like Cricket by the age of 14, I like my mom, I like Dambu and similarly I like Anjali When all these are not wrong, what is wrong when I like Anjali, aunty? I do not know why aunty, but I like Anjali very much Even Anjali likes me a lot. What Anjali? Sorry Anjali, I just said something before. Do not feel bad... Do not touch her... Anjali, come on... I like mom, cricket and Dambu and the same like Anjali too Elders around did not understand such a small fact. I did not speak even when understood I then for some reasons felt no for likes over and above the age I felt the troubles I had were enough I will be with grandma, you go and take rest Karthik, I got to speak with you for a minute Hey, grandma wants to see you. Visiting hours are only till 6. Go and see her once Madam, your phone is ringing Hello I thought of surprising you. But you have surprised me Where are you? Yes, in the hotel It seems you did not come from yesterday evening and your dad gone to bring you has not returned till now I am not in Hyderabad What? When are you coming? I will take two days Two days? That is... That is one day before marriage. Arun, I cannot explain now. I do not want your explanation Anjali Relatives arrived here, what should I tell them? I will call you back, ok? Visiting hours are up. Do not disturb the patient and come back fast Sure Doctor What son, what did the Doctor say? He is saying it is tough now and asked to call all relatives grandma You... Oh no... Here, hit now What son, has that girl come for you? She came grandma. Her marriage is in two days and came to invite Somehow, I never used to like you from childhood. Roaming around in mischief, being sarcastic for everything, roaming like a vagabond... I used to fear that even Subbu would get spoilt along with you Take rest... Take rest One day, you went away from the house for that girl without saying anyone... Then I got so angry to come in search of you and kill you Stay calm grandma, stay cool When that girl said not to marry, you did not ask even once as to why I liked you then for the first time. Right or wrong, who would understand a girl better than this? A boy thinks how to marry the girl he likes but the girl thinks how to be after marriage No idea what is in her heart? Shall I meet her parents tomorrow and talk? It seems mom wants to speak with you. You meet mom tomorrow and talk for once Oh no, why to meet your mom now? No idea Karthik, I said mom that we are going to marry What, marriage? What is it, has Dambu not informed you? Dambu You say... My flight is in the next three days. This time I cannot stay away for long from you It is difficult for you to get a VISA in this time. So, having a marriage certificate you can easily get a dependent VISA After you come down, we will again come back to India after six months Then if needed, we will invite all and arrange for a party Guys.... Hey, what? Have you said? Hey, I thought to give a surprise. I even called mom and dad to come tomorrow Huh... it is hurting Congratulations Karthik, you are finally going to America I am giving you a bonus as this project finished successfully You know what is that? I am relieving you even without a notice period. All the very best One minute... Please go sir Eat dude No Even that fellow knows about marriage. but I don't know. Surprise is for you and not for him Actually, this is idli actually and this is chutney actually Idli and Chutney good actually Actually this is sambar actually... Idli and sambar also very good actually Actually... My dear Rajesh... Actually... My dear Rajesh... Wait sir, I am explaining She knows everything even without explaining. You come to a side. Yummy, actually.. What are you talking there? It was you saying to talk in English when a client comes and show up Other than actually and taking out Idli, sambar, where is English in what you spoke? What is it sir? I said excellent at last, right? Do they say it as English, dear? Is it not? It goes so when waiters from hotel are brought and appointed as program writers. Mistake is mine Oh, yes! Like a job for Obama is given to me? You will have it Mutton is very hard sir Is it? Adjust with chicken for today, please If you say no and wantonly mutton, keep that in my mouth. I will chew and spit it out. You eat then. It would be soft. Oh no, what if you chew and swallow? Yes, I am so... So Karthik, it is been how many years? It is been thirteen years, I liked Anjali for the first time I saw her I am asking from when are you into job? I think 4 to 5 years So, what is your future plan? Anjali said to send VISA papers after going to US. I am thinking to start shopping after that. Oh, have you asked about the job? Never mind! Mom, can we go? Yes son, 5 minutes... You play Anjali said you did B Com and how did you get a job in IT? I did two months course after coming to Hyderabad. Then a vacancy came up in the office of our Subbu and he managed. Huh, Anjali would manage after going to US. That sounds like a plan Aishu, finish your drink. Madam, can I ask you one thing? Why do you never like me? I too do not understand the same thing Why did Anjali like you? Why do you not talk when I asked did you like Karthik, mummy? Will you stop marrying him if I say not to have liked? I will not Do not say job and career of Karthik is the reason for this, mummy I do not care about his job or money. He is aimless and irresponsible But he loves me Anjali, all the couples getting separated now after fighting are all married once with great love We should marry not with an answer about how we are till today in love But with a question of how we would be tomorrow. Parents in childhood, Subbu after growing young and you now... He is always dependent and comfortable If you see once he is out of that comfort zone, you will see the real person You will understand that three months after the marriage Driver, stop the car Anjali, all say that your thought process and behavior are like me Just for the five minutes I spoke with Karthik, I felt him like your dad If you ever have to get down in middle like this after marriage, do not forget that I am there Good luck baby! Amongst the kids going happily back home after school, I used to go in fear of what fight would I have to see going home now At times, I used feel like running away somewhere leaving out all these I never used to understand why they married at all, when they are fighting so much That same question has now come in my life What if Karthik too changes like Daddy as said by mummy? What if I and Karthik always fight like mom and dad? I was frightened. I did not remember even love of Karthik that moment I do not like this marriage Karthik. Leaving you and going maybe my selfishness but our love is not false If that is false, there is no meaning to my life so long I should say there is no mistake from you in what has happened I should say you should go on with your life I should see above all these, if possible I should hold you tight and cry This is the last chance for me for all these to be possible, Karthik I have thus come for you Karthik I have come again for you Why did you come back again Anjali? Why did you come again? Shall I say? You had the guilt of doing a mistake You wanted to explain why you left and came to clear your conscience before your marriage and thus you came Are you so selfish Anjali? Even now you want to give your explanation why you had to leave and then happily go and marry but have you ever thought what runs on him listening to that? He is crazy Anjali. He is still not understanding why you left him You know how he is when with you. But I know how he would be when you leave. Enough of what he went through because of you. Do not make him suffer more Anjali. In fact if you can, give a reason to forget you and then leave. Make it easy for him... Have you seen grandma? Anjali is waiting Say what? Karthik, all our letters, cards, pictures and all you have with you I want all I do not like any problem to come because of you after my marriage I am going to Hyderabad on Tuesday morning. I will keep them all in the house of Dambo Send someone to collect. Ok I need to talk with you dear You were sixteen when I and mom took divorce When the judge in court asked who do you like to stay, you said with daddy Then all thought you like me. But I know the truth Your mom likes you a lot. You felt she would come back at least for you staying with me and that we stay together I know long back that you never liked me Anjali You kept me not liked near and keeping away the person you like. What logic is this? Still, all mistakes are ours. We should not have fought in front of you. I felt you were a kid and what will you know. But never thought it hurts your heart so much This is me, he is different What is his age and what is he doing? I was insulted a lot because of him He is become so just because of you He is a kid and what does he know I unnecessarily pampered him, you know what he did? Hey Karthik He took away all the prestige safeguarded for so long Hey, come here once When sent to school to study, he is writing love letters What? Anjali and family are leaving She came with her parents to school for taking the TC Hey Karthik stop, I too am coming I am not knowing how to control him. Where are you going again? Hey Karthik, stop! Hey Karthik, get up What is this? Hey, it is bleeding Hey Dambu, I am getting to cry The feet is not controlled, my heart is left me It is become a habit, tears are not dropping The burden of your absence does not go down Heart does not listen that you will not return Nothing wrong and the love does not go You became like the rain coming and leaving I am here like the land You are the season changing while watching I am the sky standing still What is a bigger sorrow than your love? Shall I share my life if you wish for? Will your silence break if I break open my heart? I am like the breathe and will go as an exhale I am not alone, you will be always with me I am never without you even in the thoughts I promise and say that you are me Anjali, I gave all our letters and photograph at the house of Dambo I love you Karthik, I love you I will stay back with you Karthik You do not go anywhere, I love you You asked for a car to airport right, it has come sir Ask him to wait for 10 minutes, I am coming Ok sir I am afraid Anjali. I do not know the reason but I am very afraid More than the pain that you are not there, I have more fear that you will go away gain if we meet I do not know of any other world than you from childhood The moments we had when you were there and the remembrances of moments spent when you were not there I am not saying all this with an anger on you I do not just love you, but I am crazy See if you want, saying to have kept all these in the house of Dambo I am secretly taking all our remembrances along with me I do not have the courage to bear if the moment to get away from you comes again Anjali. So, let us be the same Anjali Ok Karthik, you waited so long for me right? I will wait now. Not that you should come back again to me, but will wait till you come back Come to me when you have just the love on me here and when there is no any fear We shall marry then You know right, this is yours You will come back again for me, right? Will any time or distance keep you hidden? Will any wound or silence change me? Will you not come back to this place, never being able to forget? I am driving away, leaving though burnt and shattered in any anger No idea what medicine is in these relations, this love is bouncing high again so Will you not come back to this place, never being able to forget? Will those forgotten not come back leaving the sorrow?
