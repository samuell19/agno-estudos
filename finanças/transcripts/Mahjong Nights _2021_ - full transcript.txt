The person in the viral video is so pitiful. It’s wrong to steal, but what can the mother do to feed her children when her husband is sick in a tent somewhere? Imagine, to go to jail just because of one pack of milk. Where will a person go, if they don’t have relatives who can help them here in Manila? It’s everybody for themselves in this kind of situation. Because you can’t just ask someone for help. It’s dangerous, forbidden even, to get involved with someone you know, and you can’t even go out. You remember the news, the wife was sent to the hospital for having severe COVID symptoms, The husband was on home quarantine and couldn’t visit his wife. Then when the wife returned home, the husband was dead. Because there’s no one to check on him. He just ran out of oxygen, they said. Their only child also died of COVID two months ago. Family members are in the province. This pandemic—there are the obvious effects like deaths, overcrowded hospitals, overworked frontliners, unemployment. Yes, we cope, but there are a lot of other problems that go unnoticed and unresolved. A lot of it we just forget until it comes again or it's back in the headlines. Of course, one issue gives birth to many other problems, and so forth. This crisis really exposed and magnified our weaknesses, inefficiencies and the inequalities. The very basic issues of health, money, work, food, safety, freedom and justice are all connected. People go hungry and jeepney drivers beg on the streets. While in other areas, farm produce is spoiled. Not everyone was able to receive monetary assistance, some even die while waiting in line. When it comes to punishment, the quarantine violators who are well-connected even get appointed. But it’s a different matter if the poor is caught. Now, we see the headlines but what about the problems that afflict the country in a big way. The ones we don’t prioritize or often go unreported, especially those that are exacerbated by the pandemic? Alexa, come down and help us out. The increased domestic or sexual abuse cases, what they call the 'shadow pandemic' - Actually, even during times of crisis... - Alexa! Alexa, come on, your godparents are arriving! - That’s right. - Come down. There are predators everywhere. Though we’re said to be a religious country... I’ve called you a dozen times, you know your godparents are coming. Alright, alright, I’m here. Hurry up. It’s all prepared, I’ll just put them in the pot. Don’t dawdle, go. Hey, Wylo! Esther! We’re near already! Really? Okay. I’ll call when I’m in the area, ETA 5 pm. Heavy traffic at the checkpoint, you know. Okay? Alright, take care. See you! Big boy, have you brought the table from the stockroom? Not yet. What? Come, I’ll help you get it. Okay. I don't know why... your mom really had to leave us at this time. Just when we have visitors coming around. I’m sorry. Quick, my friends are arriving already. Yes. - What took you so long? - I’m sorry. - I’ll shove your phone down your throat. - Sorry, sir. Esther! Alexa! Big boy! Finish that, and get the groceries from the car. Hurry up... I have somewhere to go. Have somebody help you. Alexa. Tell your mom I’ll be home by evening. Yes. Ma’am, careful. Here it is, Big boy! Wipe the dust off, alright. Sure. The drawers are here, take them too. -Is it too heavy, Big boy? -I can carry it. Don’t rush. Look, here are my friends. It's Ason and... go ahead, Big boy. Wait, my bag. Esther Montes! Esther, how are you? I think I’m tearing up! Me too! I thought crows would turn white before we see each other again. How are you? -Wait... -Why? Show me your RT-PCR results first. Okay. You know what... Wait... My opening lines to you were so heartfelt and yours is to demand PCR result? That’s why I miss you. Negative. Negative? Let me see. Mine? Yours, Wylo. And here’s mine. Negative! Alright, you can kiss me now. It’s been so long! How’s everything? You’re still fresh-looking, you haven’t changed one bit. That's true. The face that refreshes. How you talk! Amparo called, said she’s on the way here. She's on her way. You know her, she always comes at the end, like a climax. Acts like a royalty. So what does that make us, penalty? It seems so. So here’s our historical mahjong table! Finally! This will be fun. Thank you, Big boy. We haven’t played for so long! I’m so excited for your strong explosions. Save your energy, your battery might run out. Won’t happen, I’m fully charged and ready for 36 hours nonstop. Yes! Your song is ancient. How young you are! How about this? Body language, Body language… Disgusting. She’s imitating Myrna Castillo. No, not Myrna Castillo. Body language- that’s Pia Moran! Pia Moran! Body language, body language. You're so wild! We’re gross. How about some coffee first? Yes, before the earth swallows us up. Let’s have coffee. Alexa, dear! Hi, godmother! Hi Alexa! Prettier than ever. Of course. They’re negative, don’t worry. Beautiful. You’re so busy with mahjong, you don’t notice your goddaughter under your noses. You’re addicts! Her aura’s different. No longer like Virgin Mary. Choose your words wisely. Stop it, Wylo. She’s blossomed into a woman, I mean. Beautiful. Isn’t she? Let’s have coffee now. She can become an actress. Yes, let her become an actress. I don’t want her to be an actress. Why not? She’s fine as she is. Thank you, dear. - Oh, the... - Wait. Anyway, where’s Leo? As usual, he is managing the business. We can turn him into an actor if you like. -I think there’s someone else. -A new one? I don't know if she'll bring him. That’s not surprising. I’ll be surprised if there’s no one. Right. You’re too much. Let’s not talk about Amparo. Aren’t you righteous? Hey. What is it? Is that Amparo’s car? I don’t know but--- That’s her, no one else is expected today. And we’re gossiping about her. Speaking of... What if she’s planted microphones around here? I don’t think she’ll bother. That’s her. She’s the only visitor we’re expecting. Right. Is that... oh yeah! Are you sure it’s her? That’s Amparo. Come, let’s welcome her. She hasn’t stepped off the van yet. Rumor's confirmed. She’s really taking her time. Amparo! It’s really her. Esther! PCR? Wylo Lee! She's already brandishing her PCR result. You fabulous demented man! What’s the latest gossip? Which young star got knocked up? Tell me. Asuncion Concepcion Salvacion! Complete name?! The queen of small loans. How are you? The Indian lenders will get mad at you. Are you all negative? Yes, we are. Of course! How about you? Negative... Let me see. I’m negative. It says, not detected. Okay, alright! What will it be? 30 to 60? No, 50 to 100. We’ll play for three days straight. I did not come here to play for thirty pesos. I need to recover my gas expenses. This place is too far. Have a heart, Amparo, I haven’t earned for three months because of this damned pandemic. I even brought my piggy-bank. Alright... 30 to 60 will do. What’s important is that... we are all together. That’s right, come on, let's begin! Let's go. So, how's the payment scheme? Since you asked, I decided to write down the rules. Because I know how your brains work, especially you Amparo. You're singling me out again. You’re always disagreeing. Look at Oakley, he agrees with us. Quiet. Alright. [DISCUSSING MAHJONG RULES] Jai alai? 60, so it’ll be high. Back to back? Same, 60. What about pao? 30 each. And since you can’t seem to remember what I’ve just said, hard copies are available for two pesos each. But for you Esther, it’s free, because you serve fine food here. I love you, Wylo Lee. Here we go! Let’s start, let’s start. Start building walls now. Your nails are still long. Still got the hands for it? Of course. Did you miss this? Wow, you’re quick as ever. Of course. Still the quickest stacker. My god! I missed this. There. Okay, game. Dice. Three! One, two, three, you start. Service. Here. Thank you, thank you. -You’re so slow. -Sorry! You're rusty, Wylo. Here you go, Ason. My hands are tingling. -Thank you. -Give it to me. You gave to her what I’ve given you. That’s not true. Give this to her. Mine’s incomplete. You bypassed me, are you angry at me? I still need six. I'm ready. Joker. Seven! One, two, three, four, five. Seven, hey. That's our joker. There! I’ve nothing. Okay... so... -Why so slow? -Okay, wait a sec. What’s with you? What’s come over you? I can’t believe we’re all here. That we’re actually together again. What now? We look insane. My God. We are still alive. Alright, let’s begin. We’re overdramatic. Game! My glasses fogged up. Enough of the drama. We’re like lunatics, we were laughing, then suddenly we’re crying. So today, we're going to do seafood gumbo. We're used to Filipino food. And yes, we're very competitive. It’s missing something. Our dishes have so many influences. And when you say, world cuisine... You must understand the culture behind the dish also. Alexa, which do I use? This one? Just a bit? Alright. Others prefer thick sauces... Others don't like that, some like it dry... Alexa, what do I do with this? Peel them. Okay. What is it? Can I have a glass of water? Sure. This looks delicious. Of course. You’ve been tested? Right? Of course. Thank you. Are you hungry? May I eat now? Yes. Aren’t you Aunt Amparo’s driver? I’m starving. We got stuck on the road for hours. There was an accident. You look like you haven’t eaten the whole day. You said it! I’m sorry. Have this. May I have another? Alright. If you need anything else, just tell me. Spoon and fork. Of course. Thank you. That guy looks famished. Yes, he’s shoveling food on his plate. Is this nearly cooked? Let me taste. You’re getting better at this! Finish up... They’re probably hungry now. Yes! Hey! What’s that, Wylo? There! Siete pares. Ambisyon. - You’re lucky. - Get this one. - This is what I’ve been waiting for. - I'll eat later. Payment’s 90-90. Fortune’s not with us, Oakley. That’s what I’ve been waiting for. I don’t care, I’m waiting for your payment. Mom, food is ready. Keep the change. The food’s ready, let’s eat. Let’s continue after. Wylo is on a winning streak. I'm winning. Give some food to your Aunt Amparo's driver. What’s your driver’s name? Gaspar. Don’t make her call me her Aunt, I‘m not much older than she is. Sis Amparo will do. Ma, I’ve given him food. Oh, you have? Yes. Is that so. Thank you. You want to pretend you’re young, we’ll humor you. Why, it’s true, I’m the youngest among you. Thank you, dear. Wait... why don’t you join us? I’m alright, I need to do something first. Okay, then. So his name is Gaspar. Check on them, they might need something. Yes. My goddaughter serves delicious food. If you didn’t know, she’s taking up Culinay Arts. That’s why. How does she study? Online. Everything’s online these days. Online class isn’t effective. Kids just play Mobile Legends. That’s what they say. They turn off the mic and they play. Professors think they’re studying, but they’re not. Many have been caught doing that. What if there’s an exam? They can cheat. That happens. So you’re wasting money paying for that. Not with Alexa. You have a point. Other kids learn nothing. Well Alexa’s cooking is delicious, though we have a critic here. Who? Who else, but our candidate Ason. She sits down and declares it all divine. It's true that the food is delicious. She’s like that ever since. We haven’t tasted anything, and you already conclude it’s delicious. She says she can tell by her nose. I want shrimps. Give me some too. Wait... since you all understand this online thing, guess what’s trending now? What? JFF. JFF? What is that? Just For Fans. Funs? Yes, Just For Fans. Just For Fans, what’s that? Funds? Fans. Admirers. Okay. Back in the day, fans used to give sampaguita garlands to their idols, or ask for autograph. These days you pay 1,500 and you can watch your idols have sex. What! I like that. Oh you! I like that. Amparo, really. For how much again? Just 1,500 a month. No problem, I can pay right away. Make it 2,000, and I’ll have you registered myself. Sure, I’ll send the money to you. Yes, they’ll have sex, and you can watch. Can I join that? What? Hey, Ason! You’ll join Just For Fans? Yes. My god, I’m eating. Now I’m imagining you’re naked. Yes. Who’ll pay 1,500 for you? You’re the one who should pay viewers. It’s punishment to see you naked, and we must pay? Well, I thought I heard you say ‘collab’. -Collab? -Yes. I said no such thing. You did, earlier. Maybe you know about this already! No! No, seriously. Come to think of it, that would be a brilliant idea. Any collaboration with you will collapse. Hey! Just eat! - We'll have a short exam next week. - Okay, ma'am. - That's all for today. - See you tomorrow! Goodbye! Big boy, I will be outside, okay? Okay. Nice hiding place. This is delicious. You cook well. I grew interested in cooking… because of Big boy’s mother. Big boy, the one in the kitchen earlier? What do you mean? You’re so judgemental. I bet Big boy’s smarter than you. This place is nice. You can roam about even during the pandemic. It’s alright. How long have you owned this resort? This is not a resort. It’s just a house. You’re lucky, you’re rich. This is not ours. More rice? No, I’m full. Thanks. What’s your name, by the way? Alexa. You? Gaspar. You have an Instagram account? I have. I’ll follow you. What’s your username? Alexa415. Okay. I’ll just bring Oakley to the van and have a smoke. Okay. Goodbye Oakley. Say goodbye, Oakley. Goodbye Oakley. You want coffee? I really thought we’d win today. You didn’t bring me luck. Disappointing. Help me win later, okay? When will you help me win? What’s your cuteness for? Ma’am! Where have you been? I just ate. Where? Your friend’s daughter gave me food. Take him to the car. -Gcash works like this. -Okay. You can make an online transfer instead of holding cash. For example, I will borrow 50,000 from you. If we both have Gcash, you can easily transfer the fifty thousand to me. Ah, okay. So you're sending me fifty thousand? -Fifty thousand? -Yes, Fifty thousand. I don’t have that. I can give you... Two. -Two? -Yes. Two thousand? What am I, a reporter? Put another zero to make it 20,000. Then transfer it to my Gcash account. I have to download the app? I’ll be home by Sunday. Okay, Sunday... And we were even waiting for you. Don’t wait for me. That’ll jinx my game. I didn't know you left. Alright. Whatever. Okay, tell hi to Esther and Leo for me. Why are you in a hurry? What are you doing? - Well, fine, I'm busy. - Okay, sure. - Enjoy there. - Bye. As if I don’t know you’re just checking how long you can be with your mistress. Give me a massage. That feels good. How about this? I'll do this for your account. Where’s Amparo? I thought she’ll just smoke and put Oakley in the van. What’s new? He’ll play for me. I’ll just make a call. Okay. Come on. Let’s start. Ask him if he also has Gcash. Oh, Wylo. He is handsome. Hello. Here? Yes, take Amparo’s seat. Are you good at feeling tiles? What’s wrong with my question? Your questions have innuendos. Why do you stare? You’ve a question for me? No, it’s just that I think I’ve watched you on Youtube. You’re too polite. Call me Wylo. Which video did you see? I’ve been in many. Eye to Eye? No, but it was a very old one. Ouch! It’s like a knife’s been shoved into me. That’s not possible, you’ve thick skin. I remember Inday. Don't worry, I’m sure she remembers you too, and will pay you a visit. I was with her for a long time. Just two million? Is this a joke? Don't they know I’m worth more than that? Throughout the campaign my name will be associated with their company. Do they think they're lucky? Tell them they should be ashamed of themselves. I’ll shove that two million down their throats. Don't get mad... Alright, I’ve better things to do. I’ve no idea where he’s from. That show was horrible anyway. Wylo’s on a roll again. Whose turn is it? Bring Oakley here, and my long sleeves too. Okay. Hey, let’s continue this conversation, alright? Sure. You flirt! Whose turn is it? I'm just friendly, girl. We need to endure, and make the right decisions. Most of us, we're tired and we're just coping. Sometimes, we're hanging by a thread. We try to be brave. Keeping a smile on our faces, because we have to. It's good to have friends. Hey, sorry I left my plate outside. I’ll help you do the dishes tomorrow if you like? I’m bored here in the van anyway. Your cooking is yummy, I swear. Add me, okay. This is Gaspar. This is my IG account. Kabayo’s my username. This is a song by Shanne Dandan. It's "Hanggang sa Langit". I’m excited to eat tomorrow, What’s for breakfast? Kabayo? Your username stinks! Horse Gaspar. Sure, you can come for coffee in the morning. Why’s your username Kabayo? You’re just a little pony. Yes, that’s what my basketball friends call me, Kabayo. Little pony? Thanks for accepting my request. I’ll have that coffee in the morning. My boss is stingy, she doesn’t bring food when we travel. And she’s really Strict too. Thanks for the delicious food again, I hope it’ll be the same tomorrow. I’ll stay up til this mahjong game ends. Hope my boss wins, she might give me something. Swarmed by mosquitos here… I hope I don’t get dengue. Alright Miss Beautiful. Sorry to disturb you. Good evening, sir. You’ve turned this place into a giant trash can. Pick that up. I’m sorry. I’ll put down four balls. Wait a sec. Chow! Throw! It’s mine again. For you. Throw again. Hey. Leo! Have you eaten? Do you want to eat? I’ve had dinner. Leo, stay a bit, let’s talk. Where have you been? You seem so busy, Leo. Not that busy. Nice reunion. Anybody winning yet? No, we’re just relaxing. Just relaxing. Just a diversion. You’re lucky you’ve time for diversions. I don’t. Are you sure you don’t have one? I’m all about business. Just a reminder... make sure you use the ashtray when you smoke. Of course. Come inside, let’s talk. Are you winning? Not yet… we’ve just started. You should demand tong from them. You’ll feed them. Leo… is that necessary? I’m telling you. And tell Amparo... What is it? Her driver’s littered the parking lot with cigarette butts. Okay. I didn’t know. I’ll tell her. Don’t stress yourself, I’ll attend to it. Alright? Well that's your money. Yes. What happened? He’s complaining about your smoking. That’s bad for me. Alexa. Oops. We don’t have the luck. Okay. Kang! Game! Your turn to throw. Hurry, here. Wait. Ambition! Todas! Seven pairs. Pay up, pay up! 90 each. You are lucky, Esther. Pay up. 90! We lost again, Oakley. Alexa. Alexa! You're here again. Alexa! Damn, it’s so early. What do you want? Come to the house, I’ll hand it to you. Leo… who's that? You… Damned creditors collecting this early. You just woke up and you’re angry already. Leo… Come here. What do you think you're doing? Getting friendly with that driver? Stop flirting. Why? What do you care? You dare ask me why? This is my house. Respect me. In my house! This is my house. Your daughter really cooks well. Salve’s influence. Didn’t Salve work with my mom for years? She’s perfected the Kapampangan dishes. How’s your mother’s restaurant? Well. A lot of business closed because of this pandemic. Hard times. You said it. Wylo! Yes! What are you doing? Praying? What do you think I’m doing, the laundry? These hags. -Dive in! -It's cold. I might have a seizure. Esther... Why don’t we play mahjong over there, underneath the trees? You prefer that? There? If that’s what you want, fine with me. We’ve been confined for so long. Air’s fresh over there. It’s alright with you? Yes. Amparo agrees. How about you? Fine with me. Okay, go. We’ll play there later. -Let’s eat first. -Sir. Sir. Your boss is persistent. Here. Tell your master, he can chew on that. You know, sometimes I’m scared. I’ve a feeling he’s incurred a huge debt. How much? I don’t know. How come you don’t know? He’s managing your money too, right? You should be informed of everything, you must insist. Which of your businesses failed? Most of it. Though the flower shop’s doing well. The auto repair shop, it’s doing better. But the rest didn’t prosper. Gambling doesn’t mix with business. I’m scared, I think there are people going after Leo. This one’s very tasty. It does. Get more. Gaspar, come here. Massage my back. My god, I’m shocked. Stunned by that beautiful body. Let me see it again! You tease! Crazy. Hey, Esther! Your daughter is so beautiful, she should be an actress. Take a look at her. You’re wasting her in the kitchen! Look at that body! The waistline, as narrow as a leche flan molder! You keep locking her up in the kitchen! Wylo, really. What a body, 21-inch waistline. This is how you walk gracefully. Hello. Hey, what's the update? I haven't heard from you. What a thick skull you have. I told you I’ll pay. I thought you might've forgotten me. I’m sending somebody already. You said, you'll pay today. Where's your messenger then? Damn it. How many times do I have to say it? You're mad? You're the one who owes me. Damn it. I will pay you! Out of my way! Big boy! Are you okay? What were you doing earlier? My command was very simple. But what did you do? I just want to be happy. You want to be happy? Since you were a child, I’ve given you everything you desired. Even now. But you cannot obey one regulation? This is my house. You want to be happy? You want to have fun? I can give you that. Where are you going? Go back. Esther... After all this time you still hesitate to tell us your troubles? Especially the ones concerning Leo. Aren’t we a family already? Be wise, Esther. Me, I’m married… But I’m not subservient whether it’s about money or… I just do what I want. Hey, todas! What! Bunot 60. Really! How did that happen? I think she’s cheating us somehow, while she’s doling out advice. I must recoup my losses, at least. I've been waiting for this -I won already. -Here's my payment. There, beautiful. You know what... maybe Leo... he borrowed money for gambling... and... well, he made a mistake. But he’s working. Yeah right. Do you still see your share of profits from the business? I bet he begrudges what little cash you spend on this game. No, he’s not like that. And we have everything we need. You know, when someone gambles, even if he has a job, nothing’s safe. Maybe he makes you sign documents, next thing you know the house’s already mortgaged. Families have been ruined by gambling. Some kill each other. Esther, loan sharks are dangerous. I know someone, his thumbprint was taken while he slept. He didn’t know his house was already sold. Can that happen? Definitely. Anyhow... it’s difficult when someone else is controlling your life. When you aren’t free. Are you sure, Esther, that Leo doesn't raise his hands against you? No... No. He doesn’t. -Wait, you guys want to take a break? -Okay. Let's rest a bit. Let’s have coffee. Yes. Alright. Coffee. Let’s go inside for a while. Okay. Let’s go. Esther… I’m hungry, actually. I wonder what Alexa's serving. Leo... can you tell me, how much you owe, and what have you sold and mortgaged? What? Leo, please answer me. Don’t pester me. I’ve mortgaged nothing. I’ve sold nothing. Who are those men you keep talking to? That’s none of your business. Is that possible, Leo? Yes. How can I not worry, you’re always furious when they call. Why, I permit you to play mahjong. It’s not your concern who I talk to. Remember... I’m the one who’s working in this family. I earn. Don’t pry into my affairs. Yes, I know. But don’t I deserve a bit of explanation- Remember, don’t interfere! Damn it. I probably lose because of you. What happened to your other driver? Flirted with my daughter’s piano teacher. Fired! Yes, the girl too. Gosh, how violent your scenes are. I can’t count how many you’ve sacked. Well, now you have Gaspar, driver and sweet lover. Accepts coins in the morning. Here’s the food. Thank you. Hey, Alexa lollipop. Sit here, let’s talk as we eat. I’ve received a lot of phone-in questions from your fans. They want to know if Bataan has fallen? Respect the food before you. What’s wrong with my inquiry? It’s in history, the fall of Bataan. Don’t interrupt us. You’ve a boyfriend already? I had one. You have? But only online. Online? How can Bataan fall if the siege is online? How long did this affair last? Two months. Two months? Like a short film. Millennials are like that, it’s all games now. At least they’re not addicts. We all have addictions, Ason. I don't. You’re addicted to something, you just can’t admit it. I’m sure I don’t have one. You’re just suppressed. No. I think you meant, repressed. I’m so impressed. I’m your friend on-air and this is Miss Hot Compress, warm and tightly pressed. To those who want to be squeezed, call this program, “Squeeze Me Baby”. Let’s promote... She vanished. What’s that about? She walked out on us. Gaspar. Ma’am Play for me. Okay. Should I go there now? Hello, Jessie? Later, we’re on our break. Where’s Oakley? Hereabouts, I let him roam for a bit. Okay. I’ll be home tomorrow. Okay ma'am, I'll just fix stuff here. Yeah, sure. I’ll call when I’m on the road. Okay, ma'am. Take care. -You know what, Wylo. -What? I wondering how I’ll be able to get my money back from debtors. I keep calling them, but they're not answering. And we can’t force them at this time, right? Why are you suddenly telling me this? You’re hinting that I should pay my debts, aren’t you. Oh, no. Look, Gaspar’s coming towards us. Hello. Gaspar, hey. Ma’am Amparo told me to play in her stead. Is that so. Move, he’s going to play with us. Our original seats. Why? Alright. Change would be nice though. What’s Amparo doing? She said she’ll be resting for a while. It’s good that you can play. Of course he can. Didn’t I ask him earlier if he’s good at touching? Mama told me to take her place. Okay then. Alright. The more the merrier. Better than being alone with Ason, she’s spouting nonsense. Okay. - Stop staring too much... - At who? The way you look at Alexa, it’s like you’re remembering your youth. I am. Yes, I was very beautiful then. What a liar you are. How you lie, and to these kids’ faces too! You’re mean. Well, she was beautiful back in the day. But only on during daylight. I was always beautiful then. She was beautiful. But only one day in a week. It comes and goes. Sometimes she’s pretty on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. You’re too much. Then she becomes ugly again on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. Can we start? Give me the dice. Okay. Oops! Seven. I will choose. Alexa... Two, three, four, five, six, seven. That’s yours. Yours. More. I think I’ll get lucky this time. We’ll see. What. Damn it. - Hello? - Bro? Can you load me a hundred? You're asking a loan for that? Of course I’ll pay you. You must've forgotten that you still owe me! What, you don’t trust me? It's better to be safe than sorry. We're talking about money here. They lost. Alright. After my payment. You’re greedy. Alright, alright. One character. Todas! Jai alai, 60! Todas 30-90! You’re lucky! I’m sleepy. I must say good night now. Well... This is Wylo Lee signing off for tonight. 130 AM in your frequencies. I love you, tomorrow. -See you. -Okay. Farewell. Good night, from this seductive witch. I’m exhausted! My neck hurts. Come on, let’s sleep. The way you invite me, it’s like we’re sleeping together. Did you win? I’ll just count this. I think I just recovered what I lost. You? Same. Uncle Wylo keeps winning. Yeah, he’s been killing us. I didn’t know you’re good at mahjong. No, just lucky. That didn’t look like luck, you play like an expert. Let’s clear this. It’s past midnight already. Okay. My god, Ason snores like a speedboat. Ason! She’s really asleep. Oh my god. Hey, Amparo's coming. Oh no... So you've finished playing. Where’s Gaspar? I don’t know. What happened here? The box fell. Oh no, they're going to get caught. Where have you been? I just… washed my face. Here’s the money. We just won back what we lost. Don’t do anything stupid, you son of a bitch. Why, what have I done? What are you waiting for? Come. What’s that creaking sound? Unbelievable. Alexa. Damn it, he’s persistent. He’s not content, he wants another round. Alexa. I couldn’t wake up last night, I took a pill. You didn’t return either? My campaign manager gave me migraine. Oh the great events that transpired on this table! Hey, your driver was nice. What great events did we miss? We had fun practicing our tactile skills. Didn’t we, Ason? Yes. And Alexa’s very good at the game. Did she win? Yes. Oh, she’s lucky at gambling. When she went with me to the casino, we hit the jackpot. Hey! Pong, todas! Let me see. Sixty. Wow. The old woman finally won. Wait. I’ll go to the CR. Alright. I'll leave you three for a bit. There! My back hurts too. Hey, Amparo. Are you sure about running? Yes, for councilor again. Ah, a reelectionist. I hope you go mad. No, I hope you win. The things you say! You’re easily offended. How was your sleep? It was great. How about you? I almost got caught. Yeah. What are you doing here? I don’t allow drivers in this kitchen. Get out. You’re good, aren’t you? You'll let anyone rub that itch. Have a bit of self-respect. Self-respect? Do you have that? It’s you who taught me to be this way, right? Stop what you’re doing. Or Amparo’s driver’s going to get it. You and your mother too. Do what you like. I’ll do what I like. This is my body. You didn’t contribute one single hair to this. You’re lucky you even tasted this. What’s that about? Nothing. What do you mean? Leo… Did Alexa do anything wrong? I’m just correcting your daughter. She shouldn’t let drivers into my house. Maybe you just have a dirty mind? What did you just say? I’ve got a dirty mind? You’re saying I’m in the wrong here? I’m just protecting you. Your daughter. Our daughter. Have I ever mistreated you? Either of you? Have I acted badly towards your friends? Hey! I’m sorry about earlier. That’s alright. I understand. Is that really your father? He’s not. But he provides for me and my mother. Where’s your real father? In Australia. He rarely visits. Why don’t you go to him? I want to. I don’t like it here. Will you help me escape? Escape? What for? Ma’am’s coming here. Hide yourself, there. Damn it! Ma’am! Cigarettes? My friends annoy me. Why? They’re ganging up on me. Don’t mind them, Ma’am. Screw you, I’ll get even with you. You need a massage, Ma’am? If I were you, Ma’am, I wouldn’t think too much of what they say. They don’t mean it. Just relax, Ma’am. Come here. Hey. Good afternoon, sir Leo. What’s your problem? We've come to get the money. Someone sent you? Boss Ben sent us. You can't wait till I pay your Boss? Screw you, you can’t threaten me here. This is my territory! Get out of here! And you idiot, don’t open the door for these scum! I’m sorry, sir. - We're just following orders. - Close the door. Moron. Get out of here! I’ll close it now, boss. What else can you do? I’m closing it, sir. Leo. What’s that? It’s nothing. Don’t mind them. You’re angry again. Want to relax? Take my place for a while. You know how to play, right? Wylo’s there. I’ll just help Alexa prepare dinner. Okay. Just relax, okay? Hey, Leo. You’ll play with us? That’s nice. Can we change places? Whatever suits you. We’re glad you’re here, really. I’ll sit here. Okay, I’ll switch seats. I thought you’d completely snub us. Your money. Wait, the money. Right. Is this Amparo's? I don’t like this one, no winnings here, I don’t need that. Let's begin. Leo, it’s good you decided to play with us. We haven’t seen each other for a long time. You’re busy talking to people. Always on the phone. Just managing the business. Stay here, talk to us. Okay. Okay. Hey. Let’s not serve according to seniority. Serve her. Thank you. What’s that. Serve him. Old woman! Your energy’s gone down. I’m sniffling. Flores, flores. -The game suddenly feels serious. -You need four tiles? Of course, Leo’s here. Here. One for you. Okay. You’ve completed yours? Yes. Roll the dice. Throw. Okay. I’m thinking. You don’t like that? Nothing. Zero balance. Chow. Damn this. That bird keeps coming back. Hide it! -Birds are attracted to you. -That's right. Maybe because I look like a flower. Todas. He’s good. I was waiting for that one. You’ve a lucky start. Will you accept cigarettes as change? Dear, thank you for cooking for your godparents. They’re so impressed with the food we serve here. They say it’s delicious. I really made it special for all of you. Is this beef or pork? Beef. Stew, just what you like. This is your specialty, right? Am I chopping it right? That’s alright, Ma. Do you need tomatoes for it? Sure ‘Ma. Just cut it in half. I am just messing with Ason. You haven’t lost your sense of taste? Your hearing? Hearing’s the first to go. Wait! Okay. Here. Eat this. She dropped it. Here. Todas. How lucky, he’s won already. I’m stunned. I thought I'd win this round, because I have a lot of jokers. Actually, the topic Violence against Women, it is still a sensitive topic. But it must be addressed. Because it's happening all over the world, and in our country because of this pandemic. The cases of Violence against women is still high in our country. Imagine... One in every three women experience abuse. Your turn, Wylo. Hey. I heard you’re running... for reelection as councilor. I am. I’m sure you’ll win. That’s bound to happen. Naturally. You’re rich. Very rich, Leo. I can’t count my money. And I never get into debts. Not one peso. You want me to lend you some? I will. How much do you need? Ten million? How will you pay me? And Leo, you know I didn’t acquire my wealth through illegal means. You’re so clean, Amparo Cua. Spotless. I am, Leo. Really? Is that why you bring trash into my house? You want me to point them out one by one? I’ll just have a cigarette break. Me, too. That was intense. Yes. They’ve clashed before. It’s terrifying when they quarrel. Exactly. How much have you won? Not much, I lost a lot. What? I haven’t counted, but I’ve lost several times. Here she is. Let’s play now. Okay, let's go. What now? Let’s continue. Whose turn is it? My turn, I think. I'll pick. Going back to our topic. That was good. Interesting. What part of my life do you want to talk about? You really want me to be the subject of the conversation, don’t you? It’s interesting. For council. Amparo Cua, Reelect! Right? Amparo Cua, reelect! Poor voters. They don’t know they’re voting for trash. Enough of that. Let's play. At least, I’m not molesting anybody. What did you say? You think I don’t know that you’ve been molesting Esther’s daughter for a long time? Screw you! Don’t make up stories about me! Don’t you dare swear at me! Screw you! Screw you too! Motherfucker! Screw you! Screw you, Amparo! Screw you! Gaspar! Screw you! Screw you, Amparo! Screw you too! Sir! You shit! You piece of shit. Sir, don't. Damn you! Bastard! Sir, don’t, sir! Sir, no! Piece of shit! What? Meddling son of a bitch! Screw you, you aren’t contented. -You are not content with your mistress! -Sir, no! Screw you! Screw you all! Alexa? Alexa! Alexa... Don’t be scared… Alexa! Alexa! You ungrateful bitch!
