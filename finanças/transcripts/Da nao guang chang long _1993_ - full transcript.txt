Don't you pity her? You love her, not me Go now What? Deserting me after I help you dig the corpse? You desert me in her presence - What are you doing? - I can't help it A man weeps only when his heart is broken Wish I had a man weeping over me I'm not weeping over that bitch I weep only because I fall in my first date After 30 years as a virgin Wish I had a man like you Any plans? To return to Kuang Chang Lung to see the last of him Before I woke up in the morning She cleaned my home, the left She returned to her hotel to meet her heartless husband Then she was seen hand-in-hand with her husband leaving the hotel Since then, they lived happily together But isn't it sadistic to have Fought for a man like that? Possibly, loving someone is torturing one's own self Since then, the man/ghost couple's whereabouts are unknown The ending may be too abrupt But it's a happy ending, isn't it? Goodbye, ladies and gentlemen With money, you can easily get that - Don't tell brother about it - I won't I forgot to tell you something The Buddhist rites have been performed Arms Liu said it could even kill a vampire Thank you Don't drink anymore. You can get drunk I won't, it's plum juice Ming-pao, the female ghost vengeance story is over You haven't told the listeners about tomorrow's story It depends on what ghosts I meet tomorrow Don't make fun of me! We got lots of calls about tomorrow's ghost story There are many kinds They want Cheng Ming-pao No problem, right, Ming-pao? To gain both money and favors, is it okay? They're used to it Mr. Cheng I'm here. You're... I'm that ugly heroine of your story Did that ghost possess you or is she still alive? Don't take it seriously. Only a story If she really needs that men. I'll leave No much the better But she's now on the way to Kuang Chang Lung I wish she won't come back to me like in the story I wish she won't come back to me like in the story - She won't thereafter - I hope so I must break her tie Me, too Who are you? Not my concern, I've come to finish him off too Keep away! I'll kill you, Ming-pao I'll strangle you dead What's the matter? Who's it? - You? - Are you afraid? Are you human or a ghost? I'm human You're still alive? I haven't given up yet Fang Yin Splendid. I thought I did something that can't be remedied Don't worry, evil will find its root Please forgive me I know you mean so much to me only after I've lost you It's too late to repent Since you're alive Let's sell and leave Kuang Chang Lung I swear I'll never fail you again A man swears to any girls like that You still don't trust me? Why should I fool you now? Why weren't you nicer to me before my death? Why love me now I've become a ghost? Why she not to dead I'll put it aside Would you kill tat woman for me? Last time it was an accident only If I wanted to kill you, it could be an accident too After you die, I'll kill myself That won't be necessary. We're both alive I'll tired. I don't want to run around anymore Since we love each other... Why? I don't want to die Kill you Are you out of you mind? I'm not. I'm doing it because of you Keep away! I must kill her - Who are you looking for at this hour? - Keep away! - Who are you looking for? - Him - Him? - Shit! Don't take that gun. At worst we'll die together Have you had enough scramble? I'm rotten. You collect rotten men? Shoot, shoot, if you wish Fire, shoot me, fire! Give me back that gun No Give it to me No Hold it Gun misfired! Get it back to me I killed Cheng with it I use it to kill ghosts Ghost? Let me use a pole Do you sympathize with that ghost above? I sympathize with that one below Go away! - Fang Yin - What are you doing here? Don't hurt him Chen Ming-pao, don't call me Chen Chi if I don't kill you Fugitive Chen Chi? Why are you coming back? And you? Nothing special Who? Who's it? Looks like a female - No one must go in - Lei-sha - Fang Yin - Go now I'll go if you don't You're nice. If you alive Our love-hate relationship is over. See you We have affinity What has become of your looks? It's terrible! You creep, you jilt! Stop, stop! You're in love with thin kid? You know jealousy? Out of the way! Don't you? She's dead and you still bully her? Is she dead? Yes, I've come as a walking corpse with a spirit Yes, I've come as a walking corpse with a spirit Impossible. There's no spirit in this world I did love you but am not constant Like other men, I couldn't resist other girls' temptation Can't you both be my wife and concubine? Concubinage is permitted by the Government Why? Why? Four Eyes, isn't that right? You want vengeance Come on, shoot, shoot! Four Eyes, come on, shoot! Yin, I knew you wouldn't kill me You're still in love with me, aren't you? Here are 2 bullets, one for that man The other for that ghost. Reasonable? Yes If I die, please bury us together Otherwise, I might as a ghost... Don't worry I'll arrange a decent funeral for you Kuang-shen Kuang-shen I've never loved you. Go now But I love you Don't say I won't help you What are you doing? I must keep my promise with her - Are they legally married? - Yes Don't make me crushed by a ghost, or I'll be mad Aren't we getting mad? Benefactors, what were you doing? Got a multiplex three-in-one? Two is affinity, three is jinx That's professional You brought either of them yourselves. Buddha be blessed Finished? Thank you, master Thank you What are you doing? What are you doing? Affinity or jinx, let them settle between them If... In case of trouble, tell him to come to me Ming-pao, you really are brave In fact, love doesn't mean possession only For instance, police love me and the prison loves me But they don't have to possess me, right? I'll stop if you're not interested Are you going to give yourself up? Life is short. Enjoy a few days more. Go now
