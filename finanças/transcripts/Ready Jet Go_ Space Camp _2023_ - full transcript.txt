("Universal Pictures theme song") (mysterious music) - [Mitchell] The cosmos. Fast, filled with suns, moons, stars, planets, comets, and- (Cody barking) (Mitchell yelping) Cody! (Cody panting) (Mitchell sighing) Thanks a lot. Take 46. The cosmos, fast, filled with planets, moons, and other rock-like stuff. But is there alien life out there? There is, indeed. And closer to us than you think. By the time I present this report to you at Space Camp, Dr. Chandra... (Cody whining) Cody! It will have all the evidence to prove that aliens exist. Which brings me in my first exhibit, my neighbor, Jet Propulsion. Who is not home? It's 2100 hours! A true Earth family would be inside doing something Earth-ish, like watching TV. Clearly, the Propulsions are doing something alien-ish! Planning an alien invasion! A takeover of planet Earth! Turning us all into aliens! (menacing music) (kids giggling) - [Sydney] That was great. - [Sean] So good, Jet! - [Sydney] Are there more? - Well, are we all ready for another episode of The Great Galacto? (kids cheering) (triumphant music) - Who dares to tell me comet-surfing is impossible? - Not me! - They say impossible? I say irresistible! (Sunspot squeaking) - Whoa! - [Sydney] That was so cool! (rockets roaring) (intense rock music) - [Sean] Did you see that? - Whoa! - [Sydney] That was pretty fun. (Galacto laughing) - Wow! - Until me next challenge, will I, the Great Galacto, conquer the impossible once again? To the great unknown! Excelsior! (kids cheering) - How was the Galacto Show, Jet? - Great! - And even better out in space! Thanks for taking us up here, Mr. and Mrs. Propulsion. - [Celery] You bet! - He's the greatest space explorer in the galaxy! - [Both] Except your parents. (both laughing) - He takes on impossible challenges all by himself and always succeeds! Totally brave and self-reliant! - What's self-reliant? - That means he doesn't depend on anyone else to solve his problems. I wanna do the impossible, too! Wow! Look at all that powder! Mom, dad, head over there! I can surf that comet just like Galacto! - (chuckles) Aye-aye, Captain Jet! - Come on, Sunspot! You and me are gonna be space heroes! (Sunspot chittering) (ship whooshing) (intense music) - [Celery] Be careful out there, you two! (Jet laughing) - Look, Sunspot! Just like the Great Galacto! (Sunspot chittering) (Jet laughing) Face?

Thank you very much. Now your turn! (Sunspot squeaking) (intense rock music) It's cosmic sail time! (intense rock music) - Careful, Sunspot, not too close to the crystals! - But this is how Galacto does it! - Yeah! - I can't look. - Oh, no, too close! (Sunspot squeaking) - All right, you two, enough shenanigans, as the Earthies say. Come on back inside. - [Celery] Everybody okay? - Are you all right? (Sunspot chittering) - Well, that was thrilling! - A little too thrilling. - He singed his tail a little on the comet. - Oh, no! Did he get hurt? (Sunspot chittering) - He says he's fine. Sorry, Sunspot. I got a little carried away. Next time, I'll try the Galacto Challenge by myself. Uh, Face? Can you delete everything after my song before you send it to Galacto? - Deleting last two minutes of comet surfing escapade and unfortunate tail-singing. - I think that's enough Galacto activity for one day, Jet. - Your father's right. Besides, we have to get back to Earth because you all have Space Camp in the morning! - [Sydney Sean And Mindy] Yay, Space Camp! - We've been waiting all year for this! - Right. I wonder if there's anything at Space Camp I could do for a Great Galacto-type challenge. - Uh, not sure about that, Jet. Besides, you'll have to keep it to Earthie challenges. - Yeah, don't get all cared away with this Galacto stuff and give away that you're from Bortron 7. - Ah, right, right, secret identity. Don't worry, I'll act like a regular Earthie kid. - Video re-edited. - Great! Face, will you send my fan letter to the Great Galacto Fan Club, Bortron 7, Milky Way Galaxy? - Certainly, Jet. Sending. - [Both] Excelsior! (mysterious music) ♪ Excelsior ♪ - Wow, excelsior indeed! Okay, Bortron 7, that was new fan, Jet Propulsion, with his new song, "Dear Great Galacto!" And we also received from Celerio, his video of homemade Galacto-shaped cookies. Nom, nom, nom, they look impossibly delicious. And from Horizon, who made her own Galacto suit! Can we just hear it for Horizon? Ready for action! Way to show your love, girlfriend. Oh! Whoa, whoa, what am I seeing? Okay! Looks like Jet Propulsion's fan video just moved to number one! Bumping Stella Singularity off her number one fan status! Let's take a look back at some of the impossibly daring stunts Stella has sent us. (ship whooshing) - Backside 1440 triple-cork. I got this. Aced it. - Yeah, but none of these compare to the latest from Jet! What do we know about our new number-one fan? Jet Propulsion and his intergalactic travel writer parents are currently living on a eenie-weenie planet called Earth in Boxwood Terrace! Other than that, seems like this Jet is a mystery. Peace out, Bortron 7! Better luck next time, Stella. (crowd cheering) (intense music) (door whirring) - [Ship] Greetings, Stella. Where do you need to get to? - Back to number one. - I'm sorry, what? - Number-one Galacto fan! I need to find out who this Jet Propulsion guy is. Now. To Boxwood Terrace, Planet Earth! Excelsior! (menacing music) - Have fun on Bortron 7, mom and dad! - Oh, I'm not sure "fun" is the right description for a space travel writing seminar, but... - You have fun at Space Camp with your friends! And remember, Face is in charge. - Affirmative. - [Carrot And Celery] Bye, Jet! - [Face And Jet] Bye! - Ready, Carrot? To Bortron 7! ♪ Five, four, three, two, one ♪ ♪ Doors are shut, engines on, ♪ ♪ Everybody in their place ♪ ♪ Let's go into outer space ♪ (tires squealing) (Cody barking) (Mitchell screaming) (Jet grunting) - [Jet] Backside! Front side! And triple-cork! (Jet grunting) (Sunspot chittering) - Well, Jet, ready for Space Camp? - I guess so. Come on, Sunspot. - What's the matter? - How am I gonna do anything impressive at Space Camp Without letting everyone know I'm from Bortron 7? I mean... Uh... I don't remember being this much taller than Sunspot. I think I grew? - You grew? Let's test that theory to be sure. To the kitchen! You have not grown at all. - Huh. Then is Sunspot getting shorter? (hums thoughtfully) Let's see. (Jet grunting) (monitor beeping) - Sunspot is 10% smaller overall. - What? Why? - Checking 1,987,000 possibilities. And the most likely is Sunspot had an allergic reaction to the comet dust that his tail brushed against while you two were surfing yesterday. 99% probability. - What? (Sunspot squeaking) Oh, no! What have I done? I made you shrink! - If my calculations are correct, he will continue to shrink at a rate of 5% an hour until he... - He shrinks away to nothing? (Face humming sadly) No! There's gotta be a cure! (Sunspot squeaking) Face, tell me what the cure is! - There is no known cure. (Sunspot squeaking) (monitor beeping) Wait! There is a rare element called Deshrinkulum that will restore Sunspot to his former size! - Deshrinkulum? - Correct. Once you obtain it, you would mix it with some simple H2O, Earth water, into a potion that Sunspot would drink. - Oh. (chuckles) Well, I bet dad has some Deshrinkulum in the garage. - No. It can only be found on Mascarpone, fifth planet of the Double Vanilla Binary Star System. "Binary" means two stars that orbit each other. (Sunspot chittering) - Call mom and dad! (phone ringing) - [Automated Voice] Your call is important to us. We are experiencing connection delays to Bortron 7 due to solar flares. You are caller number 8,922,000. - Looks like we are on our own. - Well, we'll have to get some der- Deshrinkulum ourselves! - It's not possible, Jet! - Don't say that! We have to! - Jet, Mascarpone is way across our galaxy! We've never been that far! - So? That doesn't mean we can't go there, right? - Well, this might be a problem. There's a black hole between the two stars of the Double Vanilla system! - And? - A black hole, Jet! A gravitational behemoth that dramatically twists space and time! You can't get near one! The gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light itself, can escape from it! - [Jet] Well... Okay, so a black hole, Mascarpone, a Double Vanilla star system. How far away is all this? - (sighs) Let's review. You are here, planet Earth. Our solar system, Proxima Centauri, the Milky Way galaxy, 52,000 light years of interstellar space, a black hole, the Double Vanilla, and finally, Mascarpone. As I said before, it is impossible! - Impossible? (Jet gasping) The Great Galacto does the impossible all the time. I just need to treat this like a Galacto challenge because this is much, much bigger than a Galacto challenge! Failure is not an option! Okay, what would Galacto do? He'd take the risk! And I'd take any risk to save Sunspot! I'll fly the family saucer there! - Wait, Jet! The saucer is- (door whirring) - Huh? Oh. I forgot. - That's correct. Your parents took the family saucer to Bortron 7. - Then I'll build a spaceship that can go to Mascarpone! - I'm in charge and I cannot allow it. - Fine. You're in charge, but we can't let Sunspot shrink away to nothing, right? - Correct. - And we've got to do whatever we can to save him, right? - Correct. But even if I allowed it, how will we do it? - Galacto traveled to a dangerous far-off planet once, and he took a spaceship with Interstellar Super Hyperdrive. That's what we need! I can upgrade my personal spaceship if I build the Interstellar Super Hyperdrive Engine that Galacto invented! (ship clattering) (Sunspot chittering) I've got the plans in my Great Galacto Inventions and Discoveries book! Look! See, Face? This Interstellar Super Hyperdrive Engine has the power to get to another star system! - Okay, but Jet, what about the black hole? Swallowing up everything! (Jet sighing) - [Jet] You're right. (somber music) (Sunspot chittering) (sighs) To save you from shrinking away to nothing, I'll do anything! Even face a black hole! - I wish I was programmed to be so brave, Jet. Alas, I am but a machine. (doorbell ringing) (Face gasping) - (gasps) Oh, no! Sean, and Sydney, and Mindy! I forgot all about Space Camp! - Why don't I answer the door and tell them that you can't come because of your mission? - No, Face! We can't tell them about my mission. They love Sunspot too, and they'd wanna come, and I can't put them in that kind of danger! (doorbell ringing) - Jet, hurry! We'll be late for Space camp! - Face, Sunspot, we can't tell them what the plan is. - But I'm programmed to honestly reply to any question asked me! - All right, then you two just stay inside! I'll handle this! (door whirring) (door creaking) - [All] Space camp, yay! - Yeah, about Space Camp. I've been thinking, you know, Sydney, how you're always telling me I should try harder to keep my secret identity on the up-high? - You mean the down-low? - Exactly! I think you're right. I might get excited and do something to throw my cover. - Blow your cover. - Yes, that! You guys go on without me. - [All] What? - This is not like you, Jet. What's going on? - Uh, nothing! Why would you think there was something going on? - Because you love space! This is Space Camp! - Jet, you've gotta come! - Sorry, Mindy, uh, I'll come, uh, later... I'll come soon, later! You guys go on without me! Bye! (door clattering) - Well, that was weird. - Yeah. What's up with Jet? (birds chirping) (footsteps tapping) (sneaky music) - 0900 hours. Mitchell Peterson leaving for Space Camp, where I will observe Jet Propulsion and record more proof that he is an alien. (ship humming) (Mitchell gasping) (ship humming) 0905, just witnessed suspicious alien spacecraft behavior landing in the woods. Investigating now. Mitchell Peterson, signing off. (Cody barking) (footsteps tapping) (menacing music) (Stella inhaling deeply) (keys beeping) (ship warbling) (mysterious music) (Cody sniffing) (Mitchell panting) (footsteps tapping) (both grunting) Sorry. Did you, uh, see anything, you know, strange up in the sky or in the woods? - Other than you? (bush rustling) Huh? (bush rustling) (Cody sniffing) (gasps) A space monster! Run! (twig snapping) (Stella screaming) (body thudding) - It's just my pet dog. - Oh. - Why did you call him a space monster? - Yes, of course! A monster of a dog, uh, that takes up space? (Stella laughing nervously) - Who are you, anyway? Where are you from? - Me? I'm from the planet Borth- Bor- Earth! Uh, just like you. - Weird. That's exactly the kinda thing an alien would say! An alien that doesn't want anyone to know it's an alien! Like Jet Propulsion! - Jet propulsion? You know of him? - I'm his next-door neighbor. - Ah, I was just going to visit him! - Well, today we have Space Camp. He's probably there with his friends. - He has Earthie friends? - Earthie? - I mean, I'm expected there too, at Space Camp. Uh... Where is it, exactly? - That way? 0930. Dr. Chandra, Mitchell Peterson reporting. There are two of them now! (dramatic music) The alien invasion has begun! (kids cheering) - [Female Instructor] Welcome to Space Camp! (kids cheering) - If you've ever dreamed of exploring space.. - And discovering what's out there in our vast universe... - Yes! - You've come to the right place. At Space Camp, you're about to experience what it's like to be an astronaut-in-training. (kids exclaiming in awe) - Oh, yeah! - Wherever you go in space, teamwork is essential. That's why you'll form teams of four flight crews to help you learn to work as a team. - Let's save a fourth place on our team for Jet. - After our morning training sessions, and a lunch of genuine space shuttle food... (kids exclaiming in awe) - Oh, yeah! - You'll get to spend the afternoon building your own spaceships! (kids cheering) - We get to do that ourselves? - For that event, we have a very special guest, Dr. Bina Chandra, the astronomer and expert on alien life who will judge your spaceships at the end of the day. - Yes! That's when I'll show her my alien invasion report! (Sean shushing) - The flight crew with the best-designed ship will win... - [Both] Four of these telescopes! (kids exclaiming in awe) - I must have that telescope! - We could sure use Jet's help with that. - Now, please go ahead and form your teams. Then join us inside for an instructional film before we start our first training session. The gyroscope chair! (kids cheering) - Where's Jet? - He's probably not coming. - [Both] What? - Why? - Oh, I meant "what" ever. Not like I care or anything, just wondering. - (scoffs) Yeah, or me. I don't care or anything. - He said he'll be here later. - Hi, I'm Sydney. And this is Mindy and Sean. - I'm Stella. Stella Singularity. From Borth- Borth, Borth, Earth, Earth, I am from Earth. - [Aurora] Hi. We need two more campers for our team. - We already have our team, but Mitchell and Stella are free. - Hi, I'm Aurora. And this is Houston. - 1010 hours, Mitchell Peterson's report to Dr. Chandra, continued. Subject A, Jet Propulsion, is clearly at his home headquarters, planning the alien invasion. While his counterpart, Stella Singularity, whom I'll refer to as Subject B, is pretending to attend Space Camp. Surely, she is an advanced scout for Subject A. I'll keep an eye on her until Subject B, I mean, Subject A arrives. Signing out. - Hey, Mitchell! (Mitchell yelping) Are you coming in, or what? (door whirring) - I'm gonna make sure I'm number one at this. Number one at what? The contest isn't until after lunch. It doesn't really matter who's the best at training. - Houston, Aurora. No point in doing anything unless you are number one. - I can think of lots of reasons. - Fun, for one. And learning. (Mindy slurping) (Mindy sighing) - Mom always says, "Don't forget to hydrate!" (Stella sighing) Let's go, Team Jet! - Team Jet? - Yeah, 'cause he's coming later. - I don't know if he's coming, Mindy. Something's up with Jet today. (Sunspot chittering) - Don't worry, buddy, I'm making progress. We can get through this, Sunspot. I won't let you down!

(Sunspot whimpering) (Jet sniffling) - This is a gyroscope chair. You kids will each try riding in it and test your ability to stay calm during an extreme situation. (gyroscope chair humming) - Wow! Just like a real space pilot! I wanna ace this! - The goal is to spin in the chair for up to 10 seconds. If at any time you feel like it's too much and you wanna stop... - Just push this big red button. - I can do this. (gyroscope chair humming) (Sean groaning) (buzzer ringing) (Sean groaning) (Stella sighing) - [Sydney] Atta boy, Sean. - [Mindy] Oh, boy! (squeals) (gyroscope chair humming) (Mindy squealing) - [Both] Go, Mindy! Yeah! (kids cheering) (buzzer ringing) - You almost made it to the end. Someday, you could be a great pilot. - I think so, too. - (scoffs) I'm going to win this. - Don't you mean "we?" We're a team. - Oh, yeah, sure thing. (Stella yawning) (seatbelt clicking) (gyroscope chair humming) Excelsior. - [Kid 1] Whoa! - [Kid 2] Wow, how's she doing that? (gyroscope chair humming) - A space hero always keeps her cool. To the great unknown, excelsior! - Where did she say she's from? - Planet Earth. - Okay, now we're going to practice landing a spacecraft in our simulator. You'll take turns landing the sim on a variety of surfaces. Again, teamwork! Help each other out. (machine whirring) - Okay. (machine whirring) - Okay, Sydney, looks like there's a lot of boulders to your right. Move left a little. No! - But not too far! Move right! - No! Too far right, move left! - You guys! I can't go left and right at the same time! - Easy, not too fast! Use your thrusters! (buzzer ringing) - Sorry. I should have let you drive, Mindy. - Don't worry, teammate. We'll get it next time. (knuckles cracking) - Prepare to be amazed! (rock cracking) (buzzer ringing) - I drive next time. - Actually, it's my turn next. - And then mine. - Welcome to the zero-G pool. Your spacesuits underwater will make you feel like you're weightless, just like in space. - [Male Instructor] Your team has to take a ball, swim to the bottom, and place it in this box. Remember, work together. - Team Mitchell, you're up! (water splashing) (intense music) (Houston gasping) - [Mitchell] Stella! (intense music) (container clattering) (water bubbling) What happened to teamwork? - [Female Instructor] Congratulations on completing your astronaut training! And great job in the zero-gravity simulation tank. After lunch, your teams will return here to build your dream model spacecraft! (kids cheering) - It's time to apply what you've learned. Let your imaginations go wild! (kids cheering) Now let's all go to lunch. - This is gonna be so great! This is where we win those telescopes. - I'm gonna win that. A nice souvenir. Excelsior. - Excelsior? That's what Jet says. Weird. - It's lunchtime. Didn't you say Jet was coming? - Yeah! I wonder what's keeping him. - Why don't you call him? - I'm too little to have a phone, silly! (suspenseful music) - Here, use mine. - Thanks, Mitchell! (pensive music) (Sunspot chittering) (metal clanking) - Nah, that's not right either. (groans) I'm never gonna find a Pernamble Regulator in my stuff, Face! Sunspot and I have looked everywhere! (Sunspot squeaking) I don't have enough parts to build this! - Hi, Jet! (Face and Jet gasping) Mitchell let me use his phone. - Mindy, I can't really talk, I'm building a- I mean, I'm building nothing unusual! Typical day in the garage! - After lunch, we're gonna build a spaceship, and you're on our team. - Whoa! That almost looks like a Pernamble Regulator! - A Pernamble what? - Uh, what's all that stuff behind you, Mindy? - Uh, some of the cool parts we can use to build our ships. - You can use any of those parts? - [Mindy] Well, sure. Whatever we want. Our imaginations are supposed to go wild! - Great! Gotta go, Mindy! See you very soon! Excelsior! Change of plans, I'm going to Space Camp! - I'd better accompany you. Now that Sunspot is smaller, you're going to need my help. (Jet humming thoughtfully) - But how are we gonna get you into Space Camp? It's for Earthies, not computers. Hi! Jet Propulsion. I'm here for Space Camp! Sorry I'm late, some family issues, right, uh, Mr. Face? - Uh... Oh, uh, yes, that is correct, Jet. I am technically in your family and we have issues. (Face laughing awkwardly) - Okay. (Sunspot grumbling) - Oh, my! Sorry about that. I have a small creature for a torso- I mean I have, uh, human gas. (Sunspot squeaking) (Face laughing nervously) Right! Anyway, to Space Camp. - Ah-ah-ah, hold it! Space Camp is that way, sir. - Oh, thanks. Come on, Mr. Face! Excelsior! (kids murmuring) - [Aurora] Cool, space food! Nice! (Houston slurping) (Mindy munching) (kids murmuring) (sneaky music) - All right, Face, Sunspot. (Sunspot squeaking) I have a good feeling we can find what we need to build the Galacto Interstellar Super Hyperdrive Space Engine! - Sunspot, right! No, left! (metal clanging) (Face yelping) (Jet grunting) (Jet exclaiming in awe) - (gasps) Face, Sunspot! I found it! - The Pernamble Regulator? - Yes! This is great! (Sunspot squeaking) We'll build my engine right here where no one can see us! Then, we'll take it home and put it in my ship! Excelsior! - Okay, Space Campers! - [Male And Female Instructors] Let's build some spaceships! (kids cheering) - Oh, no! (kids cheering) (funky music) (suspenseful music) (funky music) (suspenseful music) (Stella gasping) (Stella sighing in relief) - [Sean] Not a bad-looking spaceship! - [Sydney] I agree, Sean! let's find something for the dashboard and steering controls. - 1340 hours, observing Subject B. Clearly waiting for her rendezvous with Subject A to begin the alien invasion. (feet stomping) - There you are! You're supposed to be helping us. - Yeah, you and Stella "Has to be Number One" are not pulling your weight. - Oh, sorry. I just- I'm involved with extremely important things. - Can you do the extremely important things on your own time? You're supposed to be on a team, remember? - (sighs) Okay. How can I help? - We need something that looks like an engine. - But we don't need an engine. - It doesn't have to work, just look like one. It'll be impressive. - (sighs) Okay, sure. - Something real-looking! Authentic! - Sure, authentic. (tools clattering) - Jet! I've got it! - Hooray! You found the flange! (laughs) Good work, Mr. Face! That goes for both of you. - Thank you. (Sunspot squealing) (Sunspot chittering) (Jet gasping) - Sunspot! You're really small! (Sunspot squeaking) I know, buddy. I'm working as fast as I can. (Jet grunting) There! I think that's it! - The engine is done! - [Sydney Sean And Mindy] Jet! - Oh, hi! (Sunspot squeaking) There you are! - When did you get here? - Uh, I just got here. (Jet laughing awkwardly) - What are you doing? - Nothing! Just building an Earthie spacecraft. - You were supposed to build it with us! We're a team! - Team Jet! - Yeah! Uh, I'm looking for engine parts. - We don't really need an engine. - Uh, okay, so nevermind an engine. How about a rusted- - Oh. Perfect, looks just like an engine. (Mitchell grunting) (Face whimpering) - Well, come on! Come see our ship! - Uh, well... (sighs) Okay. Enough. The truth is- - [Face] Jet! The engine, the engine! - What's Face doing here? - Where is it? - Mitchell took it! - Oh, no! Where's Mitchell? - Building his spaceship! This way! (energetic music) - Mitchell! - (gasps) Jet Propulsion! (energetic music) - Hey, nice. Looks like a real engine. - That's more like it. Authentic! (metal clanging) That should fit just right. (monitor beeping) Perfect. Now we just need some space snacks to stock the pantry. (hood clattering) - Come on, teammate! (Mitchell groaning) (footsteps tapping) - Mitchell? - What's going on, Jet? - Mitchell took my Interstellar Hyperdrive engine! I've got to get it back! - We'll help you! What's it look like? - It's sort of a super-slick, you know, Galacto-style engine with a Pernamble Regulator. - [Mindy] A Pernamble what? (suspenseful music) - [Sean] Mitchell? (Stella gasping) - [Sydney] Mitchell! (Stella grunting) - [Mindy] Mitchell! - [Sydney] Mitchell! - [Jet] Mitchell! - [Mindy] Mitchell! - Come on, let's check inside. (suspenseful music) - Oh, Stella! Did you guys happen to borrow Jet's engine for your ship? - My ship? I didn't have anything to do with this sorry excuse for a ship. It's all fake. Look, these buttons, they don't even do anything. (buttons beeping) (engine rumbling) - What's going on? - This ship's about to take off! - Take off? (Mindy and Sydney gasping) - We've got to stop this! - Stop what? So they have a few sound effects. (timer beeping) (ship whirring) (rockets roaring) - Jet! Turn off the engine! - Sunspot! Time to go! (Sunspot squeaking) - Wait! - [Jet] Excelsior! - No, Sunspot! - Hold on tight, little buddy. - Jet! I'm supposed to look after you! - [Sean] Oh, no, Jet! Look! - [Sydney] He's outside! - [Mindy] We gotta help him! (timer beeping) (ship whooshing) (Face screaming) (Mitchell yelping) - What the heck was that? (ship whooshing) - Oh, dear. Whatever will I tell Carrot and Celery? (rockets roaring) (Jet grunting) - Guys! Open up! - Give me your hand! - [Mindy] Jump in! - [Sydney] Hurry! (Jet grunting) - What's going on? This spaceship is pretend! It's not supposed to fly! Oh, no, we're in space! - Wow! Go, Team Mitchell! How'd you pull this off, Stella? - I had nothing to do with it. (air hissing) (Sydney gasping) - [Sydney] Oh, no! We'd better seal any air holes. Take this tape! - And we'd better put on these space suits! (ship whooshing) - Hey, how you doing in there, little buddy? (Sunspot squeaking) You're right, I forgot. I should call Face. - Face 9,000, ready to assist you. Oh, Jet! I'm so glad to see you! I was extremely worried when you left so suddenly! - Sorry, Face. But it's good you're still on Earth, 'cause you can cover for us while we're gone. - But how can I cover for you? Your whole Space Camp team is on board the ship! - Uh, just be creative! (communicator beeping) - Be creative? - Hi. I must have taken a wrong turn. And you are? - I, uh... (hums) (Face stammering) - I can't believe Team Mitchell didn't put helmets on the ship. - It was supposed to be pretend! - Well, at least we'll have breathable air. - Could you help? - No point in trying to patch up this flimsy three-part Bortronian meal carton when I have a real ship. Where is it? - Did you say "Bortronian?" - Where is it? Where is it? (Stella growling) - I am, um, Mr. Face. I am visiting at Space Camp in some unofficial capacity, which I must see to now. - Huh. Someone left their can opener here. (ship thudding) (footsteps tapping) (Stella growling) (keys beeping) (ship warbling) - Oh, no. It's gone! - I heard what you said about a Bortronian meal. A hoagie, figanas, and... - Exploding shake! (Stella gasping) - Only someone from Bortron 7 would know about exploding shakes! - [All] You're from Bortron 7! - Wait. Stella? Aren't you the number-one Galacto fan? - Could be. I'd like you to turn around now. My ship is back at Space Camp. - (sighs) I have to keep going. I have no choice. Sunspot, you wanna come out? (Sunspot squeaking) (all gasping) - Sunspot, you're so small! - He had an allergic reaction to that comet tail. It's causing him to shrink. - He's shrinking? - Poor Sunspot! I know what it's like to be small. (Sunspot squeaking) - We've got to fix this. - See, that's why I didn't come to Space Camp with you guys. I had to try and build an engine so I could get to a planet that has a super rare element called Deshrinkulum that will cure Sunspot! - Why didn't you tell us? - I already got Sunspot in trouble. I didn't wanna put you in danger, too. - Well, which planet? Uranus, Neptune? - It's a planet called Mascarpone. - What are you thinking? Flying a pretend spaceship to another star system? (ship creaking) (Sean groaning anxiously) Oh, no. - Certainly not in this rinky-dink tin can. - Well, I'm sorry, but I have to save Sunspot! (Sunspot squeaking) So it looks like we're all going to Mascarpone! (Jet sighing) Galacto has done the impossible. - Impossible? Yeah. Say goodbye to being number-one fan, Jet Propulsion. Here I am, Stella Singularity, taking on the most impossible mission ever. (ship whooshing) - Mitchell, where are you going? Our ship is this way. - Oh. - (gasps) What have you done? - I didn't do that! - Stella altered our ship be her own. - It is pretty slick. Like a real authentic spaceship! - But it was supposed to be a team effort. It's not right! - Hello, hello? Subject B? I mean, Stella? Are you in there? - Come out! We wanna talk to you! - (sighs) She's not in there. Let's go find her. - I'll wait here in case she comes back. - [Stella] I have successfully left the solar system. I'm hurdling towards the great unknown. I'm in a homemade spacecraft made at Earthie Space Camp. What a great mission I have undertaken. - Wow! Sunspot is getting really small! - I'd better engage the Interstellar Super Hyperdrive. - Super Hyperdrive? How do you know it's gonna work? - Only one way to find out! Get ready to go super fast! - Hold on. Let me close my eyes. (Jet grunting) (Sunspot groaning) - Well, that worked great. (Sunspot chittering) - Oh, this one! (ship whooshing) (all screaming) (Mindy groaning) - [Sydney] Jet! - What's wrong, guys? The engine works! (Sunspot chittering) Oh! You're right, Sunspot. Maybe this would be a good time for a song.

It must be the extra-strong gravity from the black hole! No one has ever escaped a black hole! (sighs) How will I explain this to your parents? (all screaming) - We're being pulled into a black hole, and they're all screaming, but I, Stella Singularity, will save everyone. (pedal thumping) I need more power outta my engine! - Your engine? - It's my team's ship, so it's my engine! - Face, we need our backup power, but it's not working! - There is a reset switch in the engine. - Okay, I got this! (Jet grunting) I can't reach it! - I can fit! 'Cause I'm little. (alarm blaring) (Mindy grunting) (ship humming) Good to go! (ship humming) (all screaming) (Mindy laughing) - You did it, Mindy! (all cheering) - Yeah! - [Face] Well done! - Without a second to spare, I successfully reset the backup switch, re-powered the engine, and piloted my ship out of a black hole! - Now, look for a blue-and-white-striped planet. - Look, there it is! Mascarpone! (birds chirping) (ship humming) (Mitchell gasping) - What? (door whirring) Whoa. - [Ship] Greetings, Stella. Where do you need to get to? - Who's that? - Your spacecraft, at your service. - This is it! Proof of alien technology! Woo-hoo! - [Jet] We're here! (kids exclaiming in awe) - Wow. I'm actually glad I came along to see this. - [Mindy] It's so pretty! - I've seen prettier. (ship whooshing) - I can feel gravity coming back. We must be entering the planet's atmosphere. (ship whooshing) Incredible! - [Mindy] Whoa! - Where are we supposed to find this Deshrinkulum, anyway? - Face? Any ideas? - The Deshrinkulum should be found underground in the planet's caves, in sedimentary layers below the surface of the planet. - Couldn't it also be in a layer down at the bottom of a deep canyon? - Like the one we're approaching? - What's "sedimentary" mean? - Guys, I can't hear myself think! - This is why Galacto takes on the impossible by himself. - Hey, my friends just wanna help! They can't help it if they're- - Not helpful? (ship whooshing) (all screaming) - Hey, guys, can I land? - No, you're too little. - [Mindy] Whoa, oh, no, look out! (ship crashing) (all screaming) (all sighing) Next time, I get to drive. (Sunspot chittering) - Jet, how can we go out there? We don't have helmets! (communicator beeping) - [Face] Jet! I was finally able to research the planet's atmosphere. It's a pleasant mix of nitrogen and oxygen, and quite breathable. - Great, we can come with you. (Sean chuckling nervously) - Affirmative! - (gasps) Oh, no! We don't have any H2O! - H2O? - Earthies call it water. - The stuff that oceans are made of. - Oh. - We need it to mix with the Deshrinkulum for it to work! - Here! Mom always says, "Don't forget to hydrate." - Oh, Mindy! Thank goodness! (door whirring) I think it would be safer if you guys wait with the ship. - Think we're gonna let you wander some strange planet alone? No, we're coming with you, Jet. - When did you get brave? - I think it's just better if we stick together. (Jet gasping) - [Jet] A ship! - [Stella] (gasps) It's... The Great Galacto! - What's he doing here? (suspenseful music) - [Jet] Stella, wait up! (suspenseful music) - [Sydney] Wow! Look at the size of this thing! (wind howling) - (growls) I can't see a thing! - We brought flashlights. - (laughs) Good thinking! Uh... Galacto? - Great Galacto? (mysterious music) (Jet grunting) (door whirring) - Whoa. - [Sydney] If he was here, he's not here now. (suspenseful music) - [Jet] Hey! This looks like the ship's log! - Oh, my gosh! I found the Great Galacto's ship log! I can't believe how cool this is! - [Mindy] What's it say? - "I fear I'm done. No time to wait. I only hope I'm not too late. I'll search the caves before I'm doomed and hope that help comes to me soon?" Ugh, his writing gets so little, I can't read the rest. - Let me try to read it, 'cause I'm little. (Stella harrumphing) (Mindy gasping) - Wow, you really don't understand teamwork. - Who needs it? - Sunspot does. We all need to work together to find the Deshrinkulum. - That's your business. I'm gonna save Galacto and I'll be Galacto's number-one fan forever. I'm just gonna borrow this forever, thank you. - Hey! - Come on, Stella! (suspenseful music) - I'm about to enter these extremely dangerous caves, but I'll take the risk to save Galacto. Meanwhile, Jet's too wrapped up trying to save some silly pet. Some number-one fan he is. Using my exceptional tracking skills, I determined that Galacto went into this cave. Excelsior! - They said the Deshrinkulum could be down in these caves. - [Sean] But which one? - [Mindy] It looks like this one. This is the right cave. It looks the oldest. - [Sydney] How do you know which is oldest? - [Sean] Why's the oldest is the right one? - Guys, hold on! - Let's just pick one! - I bet it's this one! It looks like it goes the deepest. - It looks the scariest! - [Mindy] No, this one is scarier. - Let's just try this cave. - (growls) Guys, stop! You're not helping! I gotta just do this. To the great unknown. Excelsior! - Jet! - [Sydney] Jet! - [Mindy] Wait! - We're never gonna find him in here. Maybe we should just go back to the ship. - He's our friend. We gotta help him. - Come on! (Sean sighing) - Wait for me! (dramatic music) (mysterious music) (Sunspot whining) - It's okay, buddy. I'll find it. (Sunspot squeaking) Well, look on the bright side. You're easier to carry. (Sunspot squeaking) Yeah, I know. It's not very funny. I'm sorry. Whoa, that's pretty high. You'd better ride in here now, Sunspot. Excelsi- (Jet screaming) (Jet grunting) (body thudding) How you doing, Sunspot? (Jet gulping) Water? No? Sunspot? Sunspot? Sunspot? Sunspot! (bottle clattering) (water splashing) (Jet gasping) Oh, no! (Jet sobbing) Oh, Sunspot! - [Sean] Jet! Jet, where are you? - [Sydney] Where are you? - [All] Jet! - Oh my gosh, we found you! - [Sydney] We want to help you! - You can't help. I've messed everything up. I'm no hero. I'm just lost down here. And now I've gotten you lost, too! (sighs) And I've lost my best friend. - (gasps) Sunspot's lost? - Oh, no, Jet! This is terrible! We'll help you find him. - It's impossible. He's gone. (lid rattling) - [Sean] Look, Jet! - Huh? (lid rattling) (all sighing in relief) (Sunspot chattering) Thank goodness! You really scared me there, buddy! Thank you, Sean. I'm sorry, Sunspot. I let you down. I'm no Galacto. I've done everything I can to try and save you. - Except one thing. Ask us for help. - I guess I was sure I'd have a better chance of saving Sunspot on my own. Like the great Galacto. - Well, that's fine for Galacto, but we're in this together. - Yeah, we're your friends. - You think there's a chance? I spilled all the water! (Sean humming thoughtfully) - Well, we'll figure it out. Come on, let's find the Deshrinkulum first. - Together! (Jet humming happily) None of us can climb up there! - Wait.

Such splendid music! Compliments to you! - Galacto, I'm Jet Propulsion. I'm a huge fan! It's so great to meet you! (comical music) You look a lot taller in your videos. - Normally, I am. Ugh, there was I, wasn't I? Surfing the white, wondrous tail of a comet! And so while I was caught in the swift, I had meself an uncommon allergic reaction, for I've been shrinking ever since. - The same thing happened to my pal, Sunspot! - I should tell you wee kiddies not to try me escapades at home. Apologies to you both. (Sunspot squeaking) I was in such a mad state to find the Deshrinkulum cure, I left without me trusty crew. By the time I touched down, I was far too small to man the helm of my own ship. Hence me shameful parking job. - Your crew? I thought you always voyage alone! - [Sydney] Yeah! (Galacto laughing) - None of me big, bold adventures would be possible without me crew. Behind the scenes, helping me run the ship, make me videos, doing me promotion! (laughs) It does take a team! Isn't it just like that song you were singing now? Just like. And here we are, matey, devastatingly small. (Sunspot chittering) - Well, at least things couldn't get any worse. - [Stella] Space monster! Run! (monster growling) (all screaming) - Run in different directions! - Wait! We should form a squad! It'll make us appear bigger! - Yeah! Everyone, link arms! (monster growling) (feet stomping) - Nobody move! Hold your ground! (Monster grumbling) (Sean yelping) (monster sniffing) - Please don't eat me! (monster slurping) (Sean groaning) (feet stomping) (kids whimpering) (monster sniffing) (monster whining) - Huh? - Guys, I think it might be friendly. - Great! We're glad you're friendly. We're friendly, too! (monster whining) You know where the Deshrinkulum is? (monster chittering) - I think he does! - We're gonna follow a space monster? - Why not? (comical music) (feet stomping) - [Jet] Wow! - [Sydney] Look! (kids exclaiming in awe) - Is... - That... - Deshrinkulum! The stuff we need to stop shrinking! - [Stella] Uh, hello? You guys? - Huh? - I think I'm ready to work as a team. - We'll get you, Stella! Hang on! (all grunting) - Okay, we gotta rescue Stella and get the Deshrinkulum!

Sorry I tried to take over your mission. - Oh, don't worry about it. I'm glad you're here. To help, right? - Yeah. - Careful not to move too much. It's like these filaments are alive. - Yeah. Every little move turns into a big one! (all screaming) - [Galacto] Easy, Jet! - [Sydney] Slow down! - [Mindy] Jet! Can you reach it? - Not (grunts) quite! Still got something up my sleeve! (Sunspot chittering) - The Great Galacto? - Aye, himself. - You look so much bigger in your videos. - Excelsior! (Galacto grunting) (kids screaming) - Apologies. Excelsior! (Galacto grunting) - Come on! - You got this, Galacto! (Galacto straining) (Sunspot squeaking) (all cheering loudly) (Sean shushing) (all cheering quietly) - Now to find a planet with H2O, mix it with the Deshrinkulum, and swill the glug down! - Wait, you didn't bring any water? - Uh, I was in a mad rush and I forgot to bring it. - Earth! Our planet has lots of water! - Earth's surface is mostly water! - And it's closer than Bortron 7! - There's not a moment to lose! I love to say that. Whoa!

(laughs) I'm following, yes. Oh! - Look! What? The spaceship is gone! - Mitchell, it's right in front of you. (Mitchell groaning) I'm very sorry, Mitchell, but there's simply no evidence of any aliens or alien spacecraft here. Just kids' imaginations. - Cheer up, Mitchell, come on. There's still time to finish the Team Mitchell Spaceship. - There you are, Stella! - Huh. You put our ship back the way it was! That's more like it. - Why? - [Female Instructor] Well, Dr. Chandra, time is up. Which team's spacecraft is your favorite? - Well, while I think all the team's designs are impressive, no doubt, I have to choose Team Mitchell's design. For authenticity. (Team Mitchell cheering) Its surface even seems to be realistically stressed! Like it's been super-heated and seen billions of miles of space travel! - Actually, it has- (Jet mumbling) - And, I mean, they even added space monster slime! Nice touch. (clears throat) - Wait, does this mean I win- I mean, we win the telescopes? - You do, indeed! (Team Mitchell cheering) - Nice working with you, Aurora and Houston. - [Mindy] Yes, Team Mitchell! Woo-hoo! (triumphant music) (all laughing) (Sunspot chittering) (all laughing) - [Celery] Oh, Sunspot! (all laughing) Now, anybody want more figanas? - It's getting late. I better be getting back to Bortron 7. - [All] Aww, really? - Yeah, I told my parents that I'd be home for dinner. (all groaning in disappointment) You know what? Here you go, Sean. Good job today.

I just wanna say, I hope you get to be number-one Galacto fan again back on Bortron 7. - You know, it somehow doesn't matter to me so much now. You can keep the title. - Nah. I'm happier being just Jet. Best friend of Sunspot. (Sunspot chittering) (Sunspot purring) - See you around, Jet Propulsion. (all saying goodbyes) (Stella sighing) Excelsior. (ship whooshing) - Huh?
