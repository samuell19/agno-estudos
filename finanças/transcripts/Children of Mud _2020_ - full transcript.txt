Well he's shaking the rope violently like a crazed person. He's angry. He swings Hulk Hogan against the rope and clothesline. What do you mean clothesline?

Where have you been? [EMEM] I had to fetch water. You can help me some times. [MIRACLE] You know I will help you if I can. So Binta had a colorful bird. She found it when the wind blew it off its nest. She built a cage for the bird. She fed it every day and the bird was getting bigger and bigger. How is Binta's house? It has a big window, like our city trees outside. She's about your height. I will marry Binta. Yes, bido. When I have my own house and a job and I grow. You will see now. It's just a story. Maybe there is no actual Binta. What if there is? Maybe the parents won't give you the right Binta and you'll be wondering which one. I will ask her of the birds. Stop interrupting me when I'm reading you a story or I'll just read it to myself and you won't hear it again... Oh read some more, read some more, tell me more. So one day Binta let the bird out and it flew away. Binta was sad and she cried and cried. [MIRACLE] And then what happened? And then one day the bird flew back to Binta to say thank you.

(WILDLIFE CHIRPING) (CHILDREN CHATTERING) Good morning, class. [STUDENTS] Good morning, sir. Can we have some silence. Stop writing everybody. I said stop writing, Emem. If you have not paid your school fee please stand up. Do you want me to read from the list? If you have not paid your school fee, kindly stand up. All right, can you please walk out? That's the end of your test. (GENTLE MUSIC) [EMEM] Sir, sir. What's the problem? Sir. Sir, see. Yeah, what's the problem? You have to let me come to school. No, Emem. I can't let you come to school. But I love coming to school. You see, we enjoy having you around but there's nothing I can do about it. The system here dictates that, well, if you don't pay your fee, you shouldn't be allowed to come to school. So there's nothing I can do about that. Sir, but I can pay next month. I know, Emem. You people think I'm a bad vice principal. When people see me they run away. But it's not true. Unfortunately, no matter how good you are, you see, the system makes you a bad person. In really sane societies education is meant to be free and this is what our politicians promise when they run for elections what they do otherwise and they don't even care. Do you know why? Their children are away overseas studying and so they don't care whatever happens to us. You and me, Emem, we are the scums of this Earth. The only time the government cares about us is when we have done something really, really bad. Look at the walls of this classroom. Look at the walls, they are broken. We can't fix it because we don't have money. All right, I can't let you come to school. There's nothing I can do about it. You just have to pay your fee. Sir, but I can pay next month. (GENTLE MUSIC) Do you know where they are? You should, you chased them away. Am I suppose to know where they are? They're my blood. (MAN LAUGHING) [MAN] They want to kill, the witch and her brother. What if we were wrong? What if the reason I'm barren is medical or natural. Look at yourself. How can you say you're barren? You're a fruitful soil and I have been sowing relentlessly. Is only that the crops are not growing. They're my family, I can't sleep. They are family. I don't think you realize that those who are really going to kill you are family. In our place they say those who are going to kill you are the ones that are very close to you, not the ones that are far away from you. (SOOTHING MUSIC) Hey, come here, come here.
