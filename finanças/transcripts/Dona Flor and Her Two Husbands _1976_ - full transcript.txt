AVI / DVDRip / FPS: ????: 1:57:32 -- 23.976 SUNDA Y MORNING -- CARNA VAL 1943 Just look at that BROAD! He's dead! Vadinho, brother... What'd they do to you? It's only a joke. He's pulling our legs. I wonder what it is, I wonder what it is, my love, that never gives me peace, my love, that makes love hurt s0. Could it be time for him t0 lea ve, is that why he always /ea ves, could he be in bad company, could he be a child teasing me, does he never tire 0f challenge? He knows n0 peace, nor ever will, he has n0 rest, nor ever will, he has n0 limits. DONA FLOR AND HER TWO HUSBANDS What could it be, that's like a drink, but never enough, that's like being sick 0f happiness, that n0 10 commandments can ever include, that n0 ointment can ever relieve, nor any e|/ll eye, in all 0f Bahia, nor all the Saints? . . What could it be... that has n0 control, nor ever will, that has n0 shame, nor ever will, that has n0 reason ? They should toss in a chip. Number 17, his favorite at roulette. He liked this coffin best of all. I wanted to bring it myself. It hit the boy hard. He was very fond of him. We were like brothers. His wedding ring? He neverwore it. Sold it the day before the wedding to bet on the lottery. Because he'd dreamt of an ostrich. Is it true he beat up Dona Flor? You bet he did! Hurry up, folks are waiting! Sofia, bring in the sweets. Not only beat her up... He also gambled all her money away. Pitanga liqueur or cachaga? What caused his death, Dona Norma? What hit him? Actually, there're many causes... Liver and kidneys worn out... heart tom to pieces, the lungs... Hell of a life! Vadinho and I were close buddies. When I learned of his unfortunate death... I broke out in verses... spontaneously, disorganized... as in a modem elegy, without a rhyme. He was a scrapper. Dona F|0r|'pedes, accept my sincere sympathy... You're welcome to call on me for whatever you need. Neverwill another man have such intimacy with the stars the dice and the whores. The gamblers and black women of Bahia are mourning. Roulettes wheels will stop for one minute... Flags at halfmast in every cathouse... Asses sobbing in despair! Dear, sit down for a moment. You've suffered enouqh in his hands. Rest now. I feel fine, mother. You really hated his guts! You bet I did. He was a gigolo and a shameless drunkard. A auindler, a penniless gambler, a bum! Pushing his way into my family. Carrying my daughter away to live at her expense. The man is dead now, you shouldn't talk like that. I cried my eyes out when Flor left home... 7 years ago now. 7 years are not 7 days. Now I can breathe free. I've got my daughter back. Divine understanding for he who lived for his friends. Mercy and happiness for him in thy holy peace. God almighty Thou hast so decided... Let us pray that He receiveth our brother in his glory... and he shall be delivered of all sins. Amen. Your husband was tops. I brought you some tea. Thanks, I don't want any. I didn't ask, drink up! Cheer up, love! It's good for you. You'll feel better. Have some more. Crabmeat "muqueca ". Vad/nho ?s fa vor/te dish. Wash crabs thorough/y in lemon water. Long enough t0 clean them but not s0 that you wash out the taste 0f the sea. Put them in a frying pan. Careful/y, because it's a very tricky dish. Add 4 tomatoes... one green pepper, one onion... sliced into rings t0 give it a nice appearance. And when all is well cooked... add coconut milk and "dend?" oil. Serve it hot, as I always did. His teeth bit the soft shell crabs... his lips turned yellow from the "dend?" oil. Never again his lips, his tongue... Never again his mouth burning with raw onion. What's the matter? You'd think it was our first time. Why be ashamed when it's God's wish? He said it Himself: "G0 on, children, screw and make babies." If it weren't His wish... ...He'd create all men without balls. Cut that out, Vadinho! Your little hairless pussy! S0 lovely and beautiful! I made a blind bet... asked for 3 cards. I had this feeling four queens were coming. And they did! I can't believe my eyes! On his wedding day! He's a crazy nut... but he's great! Surprise, surprise! We have a present for you. We wanted to give it to you at your last stag party... but the motherfucker didn't tum up. |didn't have to Vadinho never says goodbye! Great, that's terrific! We girls wish you and your wife happiness, lots of happiness! A pinch of salt, and just a little black pepper. Four tomatoes. Peeled? Yes, and also without the seeds. That's very important. Enough chili pepper. Add the cleaned shrimps to the stew cooked in oil... and the other ingredients. The shrimp "quibebe" is a dish... that pleases all tastes. But it's a mistake to think it's easily made. Cooked wrongly it can tum out a disaster. Let's now talk about our next cookery class. We'll make a "sarapate|". Write down the ingredients you have to bring. Pork, lamb or 0x parts... 3 bunches of coriander, 1 leaf oflaurel... Pepper... one onion, garlic... fat and animal blood. Did you take note? Thanks, Sofia. To the stew you also add pumpkin... cut into small pieces. I'll take a small piece, this size. Stir in the stew... the small bits of pumpkin. Let it cook until the pumpkin is soft. See that it's salty enough. When the "quibebe" is ready... put it in a bowl and garnish it with sliced tomatoes... onion rings and green pepper. I advise you to serve it with rice... but you can also serve it plain. This dish is your masterpiece! Just super! Aren't you having some cake? Sure I am, honey. Coffee is almost ready. The water is boiling. I'm late for an important engagement. Are you coming home early? A client! The Paraiso Funeral Home will pack another one! Close that thing up! To die, to sleep... no IIIOTB. By sleep to say we end! 1 bet 500 it's a male corpse. Have respect for the dead! 1 bet 500 it's a female corpse. 700... female corpse! Is it male or female? The corpse. Male or female? The name's Darci de Oliveira. Then it could be either. For instance, our first lady was Darci Vargas... This 0ne's a man, isn't it? How do I know? Pricks or pussies, I see no difference. All I do is burythem. The bet is off! What size's the coffin? Six feet long. Darci de Oliveira, a six-foot woman? Not even in a circus! Vadinho, I'm talking to you. I want you to take me to the casinos. I said I don't want you in those places. What they say about me is enough. You won't take me so I won't meet your chicks. They're trash, Flor... trash to kill time. For me there's only you. D0 you swear? Sometimes I think we could be... ...a couple like any other. You'd get home from work, a newspaper under your arm... bringing me a gift. And after dinner you'd put on your pajamas... and we'd listen to the radio. Close together as we are now. Sure, and we'd sit on the sidewalk and gossip... I'd play backgammon with "Senhor" Moreira... while you read this book from the girls library. Don't you want to have a child? You like children and up to now I haven't... Don't worry, we've got lots of time... Besides, I love you so much... You're all I want. I don't lack anything. Vadihho, the neighbors! Let me close the windows! Long time no see! H0w're you doing, my son? Since we have the chance, shall we go over your sins? I don't have any. Really, none at all? You don't say! And how's Dona Flor? She's fine. Father, I was passing by and thought I'd drop in... Since you're doing all sorts of repairs around here... you could give me a loan to help me in a business. The church's money is sacred. 1 know, but if God wanted to prove what he's capable of... he'd let number 17 come up at roulette 12 times in a row. That'd be a miracle! I'd fill this church with flowers... and I'd pay for the repairs. God doesn't gamble, my son. That's because he knows no good or evil. The ball going around and around at roulette... you risking your last chip, your heart... What's the matter? God forgive me, father... Looks like the angel's trying to make the saint. Watch your language! You're in God's house. Be respectful. Forgive me, Dom Ven?ncio. But he has a gig0|0's eye... not that of an angel! Take a look at his eyes. They're lecherous eyes. Shame on you, Vadinho! Coming back to our business, if all works out right... I'll build a Cathedral to Our Lord. Alright. But let this be the last time. Enough for you, buddy. You've even lost your clothes. Not yet. I haven't lost my clothes yet. Wanna bet? They cost me good money. Let's say with the shirt and all, 250. H0w're you getting home? I'll pay you 100. Take it or leave it. You'll have to lend me your coat, buddy. You beast! Show God more respect! That man's always drunk. If the law was worth anything in this town, you'd be in jail. Trying to set a new trend, honey? I've got your |.O.U. due for payment. Mine? But I owe nobody. Let me take a look. G0 ahead. Aren't you Valdomiro Santos Guimar?es? Here's your signature. Dr. Argemiro, this |.O.U. has a co-signer. You scared me saying that. You'd better call Raimundo Reis. He's filthy rich. But of course we went to him first. He said he won't pay. He refuses to pay. Really? You see, one meets all types. What a double-crosser! Always bragging at the cabaret that he's got cocoa plantations... that in Paris he screwed 3 dames at once... Big talk! I trusted him, took him at his word... and look what happens! I go through this embarrassment. You're the one who asked for the loan. Dr. Argemiro, for God's sake... If that crook wasn't good for the money... why did he sign it? I didn't worry about it. And now this. It's not fair! I, who've always been choosy about my co-signers. Raimundo Reis, who'd believe it? This man's a threat to society! He corrupts the banking system. The sacred reliability there should be... What then should I do with this |.0.U.? Your co-signer refuses to pay. You won't even think about it. I'll have to sue for payment. Let's send this crook to jail. You can count on me. And thanks for letting me know. Don't worry, I won't fall for that one again. This |iqueur's delicious, but it gets you high fast. It does give you a high, and the worst hangover. But it's delicious. D0 you want some? G0 ahead and tell me what you want from me. D0 you think I don't know? I'm not being nicejust to take advantage of you. Say it once and for all. Well, I won't waste anytime. I need some cash. You'll have to lend me 200. I know, you have an important engagement. Not a cent! Today you won't get a cent from me. I need it, Flor. It's a case of do or die. I'll pay you tomorrow, with interest. Be an angel, honey. Give me at least 100. This will be the last time. Not a cent! You watch out! I'll get it one way or the other. N0, you won't gamble this away! Over my dead body! Let go of that shit! Dammit! Let go of that shit! Leave me alone, you bastard! You'll see, you bitch! Murderer! Bastard! Stop it, Vadinho. I'll call the police. You miserable beast! Are you hurt, dear? Close your bets. 19, red. Pay to red, 20 cruze/ros I double. Don't do that! 200 more on the red. Leave it all there. Today we'll break the bank! Eleven times on the red! This is suicide! I'm giving him a heart attack! Buddy, you're driving me bankrupt. Vadinho, I've run out of luck. Could you... It'll bring you some. Deep night, a smiling sky. the peace is almost a dream. Moonlight falling on the forest like a silver cloud 0f uncommon radiance. Only you sleep: you don ?t hear the singer 0f the gracious moon, and sad story... 0f this love that I sing; and the woman I love does not hear; she is sleeping. I sing, but not even the moon pit/es me, For when she sees it, it is I who calls you, she hides herself in mist. There 0/I high she shuns me. Oh high, lost in thought The stars serene, like vel vet moths, sing dizz/b/ t0 the moon. The Universe is silent... as it hears... your name in my lament, my tearful song... by the moon. I forgot to introduce you... At the guitar, the fabulous Carlitos. Playing the "cavaquinho", the fantastic Juvenal. At the flute, the magnificent Anacleto Porreta. Vocals: my buddy Mirand?o... the notable poet Clodoaldo... and my friend here Cazuza Funil. My name's Epaminondas Martins de Azevedo. Cazuza Funil, you s.0.b.! Excuse me, I'm looking for Dona Di0n|'sia. Third room. Are you Dona Di0n|'sia? My name's Floripedes Guimar?es. Does it mean anything to you? N0. But please sit down. You just had your baby, didn't you? Yes. It's a beautiful boy. I can't have babies... I have a problem. It's the way I'm built. Is yourwomb upside down? Something like that. But you can be cured. Marildes, a friend of mine, was. Mine's not an easy case, though. My doctor said an operation would be risky. Doctors? They're only good... at nice sweet words and bad handwriting. You must go to mother Balbina. She'll lay her hands on you... and you'll have a baby every year. Why did you come here, anyway? Well, there's a talk around town. If you know what I mean... People talk too much... Who's the child's father? Vadinho, why? If you have something to tell me, go ahead. Vadinh0's my husband. Listen, miss... I'm no lady... I'm a bitch, a whore. And I don't believe he's your husband. White women were never his dish. For Valdemar... Di0n|'sia's the only one. - Valdemar? - Valdemar, my man. We're not talking of the same man. My Vadinh0's Valdomiro. Good heavens, you scared me! I'm sorry. It's alright. My Vadinh0's black and strong. He's a truck driver. I'm sorry, I'm so ashamed! Calm down. It's alright now. S0. you're married to... the other one, who's damn crazy about... ...gamb|ing_. That's my Vad|nh0. Can I see your baby? Can I hold him? He's cute! He's really cute! Bread crumbs. What's the bet? It's worth a breakfast. Is it breakfast time already? I'll be late forwork... Tell them you're with Vadinho. This homelike scene reminds me of a truthful saying... of our late friend Pedro Arcanjo... "There's no better place for a philosopher to |ive..." "...than in a brothel..." "Especially if it's a whorehouse in Bahia." I think that's all you'll need. Come on, after all he hasn't been home for 4 days! Vadinho has to learn to respect you. I know, Norminha. Teach him a lesson. You'll stay with me for a few days. Vadinho will be sorry then... and he'll ask you back, I'm sure. You'll lay down the law and he'll accept. Won't I bother you? Sorry I didn't come before, but I didn't know what was going on. Nobody tells me anything! I'm on your side. Who'd treat a woman like that! I don't like nosing around in anyb0dy's life but you should have left that scamp a long time ago. She's right, Florzinha. You stay with me as long as you wish. I have enough room. The kids are on vacation. Thanks. It's all settled. She comes with me. It's only for a couple of days, anyway. Tell her pupils tomorrow... she's left to see her sick mother. A little lying won't hurt. Vadinh0's here! Wake up, Vadinho, or the bogeyman will get you. Shut up, you bitch! You rude thing. D0 you think you're her mother! Call me if you need me. Make your bets, gentlemen. N0 more bets. 17, red. Who's she? Leniza Mayer. A famous singer from Rio de Janeiro. I can't believe it! You here at the Palace! Did you come to break the bank? She wanted this as a birthday present. It seems like a queer present to me, but she insisted. How could I forget it? Let's make a toast! Tomorrow I'll send you my wife and the boy with a present. It'll be nice enough if theyjust come. But I insist. Excuse me. I have an important engagement. Taste this caviar. It's delicious. It's good. Tasty like a pussy. Never again his lips, his tongue Never again his mouth burning with raw onion. Good morning, Dona Flor. How do you do? My dear lady, time will heal all. That's life. It's inevitable. I'd like a bunch of those. Please, take these flowers. Accept them as a present. I insist. If you'll please... Untie them when you get to his tomb. He's a son of "Exu". His soul must rest. What is it... ? that screws me up inside, and... bursts out 0f me, and... shows in my face, and makes me blush, and shines in my eyes, and betrays me, and catches my breath, and makes me confess... what/ can hide n0 more... nor would it be right t0 refuse... that makes me a beggar, and makes me beg... that has n0 measure, nor ever will... that has n0 cure, nor ever will... that has n0 prescription ? The other day... someone asked me what to offer a guest of snobbish taste, who disliked plain cooking. In this case, I advise braised turtle... with a taste of guilt and sin. But if your guest wishes for more refined game... serve him a more sensitive dish, a young and beautiful widow. I know a widow like that. Whose bed is a desert to be crossed... Burning sand of desire, without exit. and every nerve pleads, and every organ c/amors, and my anguish makes me imp/ore for... what has n0 shame, nor ever will, what has n0 control, nor ever will, what has n0 reason. Where's Flor? In her bedroom, getting dressed. But she'll come out soon. Attention! Here she comes! I couldn't stand seeing you in that awful mourning. Thanks, I didn't want you to have so much trouble. D0 you like it? Please. sit down. You're pale, Flor. What's the matter? I don't know. I think it's a migraine. Awid0w's migraine means she doesn't have a man. At last! Stand up, I want to see you. You look nice. But you have to do something to that face. You looked like a black crow in your mourning. Poor thing! Come here and look! There's Magnolia! She won't even leave the kids alone, the bitch! She's always wallowed in the swamp of lust. I don't see how she makes it. She's so ugly! Oh well, she's got her qualities. What qualities can that good-for-nothing have? Don't you know? She's called "the sublime ass"! Dr. Teodoro, there's someone to see you. I'm coming... How d'y0u do, Dona Norma? Fine, thank you. Moreira doesn't feel well. It's his liver again. I can't understand it. He doesn't smoke or drink or eat fat. He plays backgammon. But that doesn't hurt, does it? I don't think so. I'm going to solve his problem. That's strange. I've a friend, Jos? Ot?vio... ...D0 you know him? He also plays backgammon and has a bad liver. Unless he's been drinking by himself. But it can't be that. I'd smell it. How d'you do, Dr. Teodoro? What's the matter? What's the hurry? Don't tell me you're not responsible for this! "Dona Floripedes, in the discharge of my duties-... "| received the visit... "of our friend and neighbor Dona Norma M0reira." "During our nice talk... "she told me of the great esteem you have for me." "|'d like you to know this news made me very happy." "|n this fascinating world of drugs... "sometimes rather dull... "it was a breath of poetry... "among the barbiturates and tonics." "|'m 42 years old." "|'m a sober man... "impassioned only of classical music." "But I confess these words... "disturbed my sleep." "S0 we both suffer from the same disease... "and that... "no drug can cure." "| hope you don't find me too bold... "for my intentions are the best and my devotion very deep." "|n friendship and respect: Teodoro Madureira." He's in love, Flor! And now, what shall I do? Keep it up and we'll soon have a wedding. But I just became a widow. You count your months very slowly. You're like a flame inside. You must get married... or you'll become either crazy or apathetic. I think you're right. That's the way I feel. Outside, a serious lady... inside, a naughty girl dreaming of nasty things. You're a woman. That's normal. Te0d0r0's a nice man. You won't find many like him. D'y0u like him or not? I can't deny he's very charming. I address such a venerable lady... to ask for her daughter's hand in marriage. If she deigns to accept me... as her husband... sharing with me the obstacles... and dangers of this... road of life... I'm sure, this path will be... paradise to me. I accept. I want to marry you too. You sly character! Will you have an "arag?" liqueur, Dr. Teodoro? Yes, thank you. Marvelous liqueur! It's made by the nuns of Lapa, isn't it? N0, I made it myself. Very good, isn't it? D0 you like spirits, Dr. Teodoro? Yes, sometimes. Only on social occasions, m'am. On social occasions. That's understandable. You must start looking for a house. We've already talked about that. We're going to live here. But this is such a poor house. It's a nice house, and very cheap. Dr. Te0d0r0's social position... Besides, it's near the store. And it's well located for my cookery classes. Will you still go on working, Flor? I did everything to dissuade her, Dona Rozilda. But she insists. She wants to go on with her classes. But all expenses will be on me. The money she makes will be for her pin money. Dona Rozilda, we haven't talked yet. You know I don't like gossiping. D0 you want some more? I just wanted to know something. Lower your voice. How d'you find your future son-in-Iaw? He seems an honest man, a hard-worker. A man of sound principles. But instead of being a pharmacist, he could be a doctor. A real doctor, not a half-way one. Now you'll be really happy, Flor. It's beautiful, Teodoro! D'you know how many couples spent their honeymoon in this room... after we arrived in S50 Tom?? 18... Feel at home, myturtledoves. I don't have to tell you to have a good night... Sleep well... my angels... There! Look, dear. Up there's the Southern Cross. Where? Show me. Over there, dear. The biggest and shiniest one. It's the planet Venus, called improperly the Evening Star... or the Morning Star. In Latin it's called Stella-Maris, it guides sailors. Isn't Venus also the Goddess of Love? The one without arms? Yes, she's the goddess of love in Greek mythology... and also a famous sculpture by a classical genius. You're shivering with cold. You might get flu. Don't you think it's about time, dear? Whatever you say. What d'y0u think? It's wonderful. While you change I'll go to the bathroom. You look beautiful! Our honeymoon will never end, dear. I'll always be faithful to you. I'll never look at another woman. I will be too forever. You must be tired. Sleep now. After all, it was a tiring day. Teodoro, it'll be alright. Everything will work out right. You play well, Teodoro. That's very nice. Wait until the day of our concert! Playing with the others. All together The Sons of Orpheus. What a nice group! Excuse my ignorance but why Orpheus? Because Orpheus was the Greek genius of music. He played to the animals... and to the stones. You know everything. You've finally arrived! How's Dona Rozilda? Feeling better. Itwasjust an attack of asthma. If you'd stayed longer I couldn't have stood the loneliness. How was your trip? Alright, thank you. The boat was crowded. I'm tired. Sit down. This is Madalena... our new maid. She has good references and has proved to be polite. What about Sofia? I had to fire her. While you were gone... she wouldn't obey me and was always grouchy. I told her to weep the floors... and she called me... ...ca||ed me Doctor Laxative. What cheek! Poor thing... Poor thing? She's insolent. Unworthy of your kindness, my dear. Sometimes you want to be kind... and end up by being foolish. You're right, Teodoro. I wanted to surprise you. I thought I'd finish it before you arrived. I hadn't the time. Now you can't say s0mething's missing. "A place for everything, everything in its place." D0 you know where I found your money? Behind the radio valves. Only gypsies do that. You can open a savings account. 3% interest every month. That's already something. In the bank your money is safe... from thieves. You think of everything, Teodoro. What would I do without you! I'm here as a pharmacist... proud member of this society... who tries to honor his doctor's diploma... even when against his own commercial interests. Besides... I've spent all my life... dealing with pillmakers, bowls... filters and bottles... studying diverse substances like sulphates... iodines and oxides... And I don't forget that as a man... I have to do my duty. As a responsible citizen I have to defend the interests... and the health of the population. Machine-made drugs... will never be sold in my store. I know that famous wise men here in the audience... uphold the industrialization of medicine. This is the case of our honored president... Dr. Em|'|i0 Veiga... world-renowned for his discovery of the use... of the "Jurubeba" plant for medicinal purposes. To those worthy opponents I bow with respect. But to those disloyal opponents... who underestimate my work in chemistry... I shall answerwith the correct formula... of a substance they couldn't... pronounce scientifically. "Lanate.. "G|uc0site C "equal to Ethanol... "plus Glucose... "plus 3-Digitoxines... "plus Dig0n0us0xigen0|ide." Your husband was magnificent! It was beautiful. I didn't understand it, butl liked it. Teodoro, I feel very proud when someone praises you. Even when it's a woman. In time you'll learn. The principles of pharmacology aren't very difficult. Ladies and gentlemen... The concert will start. Please, take your seats. It won't be really a party. We invited a few friends of Teodoro. Thank you for the invitation. I'll surely be there. When I think of your future I'm less pessimistic. I say to myself: here's someone really happy with life. At peace with the world. Am I right? It's almost a sin, Dom Ven?ncio. but I'll have to confess... what I'd never say to myself. Mine's a happy life. Many people envy me... But whe_n evgrything's g0|ng r|ght. We're so happy and all... I don't know what it is. I feel depressed... I don't know what it is... or how to explain it. Dom Ven?ncio, I think it's my evil nature. Not at all, Dona Flor. Happiness? not a story. A happy life's not a novel. That's true. S0, we'll be waiting for you Saturday at 8 P.M. I'll be there. To the happyjoining of the twin souls... Our recently elected treasurer... of the Bahian Pharmaceutical Society... and his noble wife, Dona Floripedes an example of qualities and virtues... And past-master of cooking. To the couple that's an example of a blessed union... blessed by God and all men. And may this anniversary... have many happy returns. From the beginning I felt Dr. Teodoro and Flor were made for each other. I'm a kind of soothsayer. Aren't I, Flor? As I was saying, 7 terrible years. I believe in any miracle worked by music. But, scientifically... we're not in complete accord. She's now the right size. Bursting at the seams. Money makes a woman beautiful. N0, not money, Peace, rest and happiness. Who'd say she'd find all this in our druggist! Why all the enthusiasm? Nothing. We're talking about the beauty... and charm of our hostess. Dr. Teodoro, even the mentally sick... are calmed by music. For example, a well played bassoon. Or a violin. The evidence's clear. Even a cripple will improve... with a massive dose of good music. Of course, physical defects... I think we overstayed, Dr. Teodoro. It's time to go. Darling, it's late. It was an unforgettable evening. Congratulations, Dona Floripedes. Thank you, come again. It was an unforgettable evening. I'll walk them to the trolley, dear. I'll be right back. Come here! Why did you come today? You sent for me. I just arrived. It's been a long time. Not on the mouth! You're fussy... You Iookjust the same. I put on weight. You look great! Good enough to eat! Dom Ven?ncio was right. He ogled your ass. Don't be silly! He was always respectful. Stop it, Vadinho! Don't forget I'm a married woman. Only my husband... I'm your husband. Have you forgotten? I'm the first. Stop. He'll be here anytime. I'm glad to see you, but now go! He must be arriving. If he sees you, what'|| I say? Dope... He can't see me. Nobody can. Only you. Flor, my downfall... He sleeps in this bed. I can't help it. But there's room for us three. Respect! I'm an honest woman. You called me! Come back tomorrow! But don't come naked, please! I can't come and go, Flor. D'y0u think the trip is easy? D'y0u think I can say: "|'m going and I'll be back"? G0, Vadinho! I'm ashamed. I'm not up to this. G0! I'm going for a walk. We'll talk tomorrow. But kiss me on the mouth... if you want me to go. It's him. G0, Vadinho! Goodbye, pal. Wonderful party, dear, nothing went wrong. Everything perfect. N0 ?aws. I loved it. Everything went well, right? I'll go drink some water, and I'll be back. Mirand?o, the magnificent! It's the marriage of heaven and earth! Unsoundable mystery of Lady Luck! Number 17, you bitch! Stop it, Vadinho! G0 away! I asked you to go. Lie down next to me. Ifl do, you'll start messing me around. I promise I won't. You'll be mine when you want to. Y0u'_|| open your legs and g|ve me your pussy. H0w?s it doing? Your pussy! You haven't changed a bit! Come near and let's talk. Closer! I missed you. Iwanted to see you, touch you. You that were so mean to me. What did I do? I heard you used to chase two of my pupils. Shame on me! You're dead and buried, |?m married again... and |?m still worrying about your affairs. I missed you. I won't betray him. Teodoro doesn't deserve that. You promised you wouldn't touch me. Not against yourwill. But I didn't say I wouldn't try. What do you want to talk about? How's the world seen from above? It's blue. What does God look like? Have you seen Him? God's fat! Take your hands off! If number 17 comes out afterthis I'll agree with you. It's witchcraft, not a swindlefs job. It's witchcraft, sorcery, black magic! N0 way out... Damn it! I'm done for! I'll go back to my Bella ltalia. Get out you devil! What's the matter? My little devil... 2 o'clock. Number 17 won't come up anymore. It's a gang, the Mafia... Watch Mirand?o. T0day?s my d8)?- 17, you s.0.b.! Black, number 17. F|0r?s wardrobe... Lady's underwear... This guy's crazy! Dr. Te0d0r0's dust coat... Hi, love! You're back! Where were you? At an important engagement. An engagement! The same old story You sent me away. Why are you complaining? What are you doing? Put it back! You told me not to go around naked. You called for me many times. You want us to fuck around, don't you? To make your pussy bum. I didn't call you for that. I wanted to talk to you. To fuck around! There's someone here! Get going, Vadinho! God sent you! Only you can help me. I have to find a way to get rid of Vadinho. He?s been disturbing me. I don't know what to do. |?ve lost my willpower. Make his soul rest again, or I won't answer for myself. He wants to take me with him. Just now, he was trying to do that. I felt so feeble, I almost went with him. If this doesn't end, that?|| happen. We?ve got to do something. I'll speak to "Pai" Jer?nimo. "Mother" Balbina can't deal with the affairs of "Ogum". Vadinho is protected by "Exu". It's got to be someone who deals with ?Oj??. D0 it quickly, or something terrible will happen. I'll get the money. Remember the first time I felt you? You got close to me... You held me and put your hand... on your mermaid ass... My smooth belly... Your avocado breasts... You grew fatter, Flor. You're plump. |?m gorgeous from top to bottom. Your pussy's the best of all. What does it taste like? You know like what! Pepper... and honey. What did you do, Flor? They're taking me away! My God! The witchcraft! Vadinho, you nut! What could it be... ? That's sighed in the alcoves... Whispered in verses and prose... Agreed inside burrows... That goes 0/I in the minds And around from mouth t0 mouth... Lighting candles in the alleys... That's spoken loud/y in the taverns... And screamed at the marketplaces... And no doubt is found in nature. What could it be... ? That is not sure and will never be... That can/mt be mended and will never be... And has n0 dimension... What could it be... ? That's found in lovers? minds... That the insanest poets sing... And inebr/ated prophets smear... That is found in the cripples? pilgrimage... And in the unhappy men ?s fancy.
