Bad luck is a thing... you have to take really calmly. It's what? 20km at most? That's a four-hour walk. I dunno if you realize! What the fuck am I doing here? - What was that? - Why did I set off with you? You're unreliable. Your plans are unreliable, you car's unreliable. Because you lost your licence. And I'm kind of your brother. Stop saying that, I don't ﬁnd it funny. What do you want me to say? - Hello. - Thank you. THE CONQUERORS Goodbye. I'll go... My sincere condolences. All my condolences. Are you Joseph's son? - Yes. - Beatriz Van der Eecken. My husband, Geert. - How do you do? - Nice to meet you. We ﬁnanced an expedition of your father. All right. And I knew your mother too. Hello. I'm his son from his first marriage, Galaad. My mother is dead too. But I don't think you knew her. - Nice to meet you. I didn't know... That he had another child? No one knew. My mother was an error of youth. He didn't own up to it. It's great to see so many of his friends here. We thought he'd fallen out with everyone. - No, you see. He was very much alone though. That's when I met him. At the time, I was just a spoilt kid. Joseph taught me everything. Later, when he moved into treasure hunting, it seemed natural to help him. I never imagined it'd make my fortune too. But Spanish galleons, temples in the jungle, were not enough. He had big dreams. At the end of the 70s, when he got it into his head to ﬁnd the Grail, I lost touch with him and thought he'd strayed. I saw him dig in his heels and squander his money. I've understood now. Joseph Tadoussac, of course, could not ﬁnd the Grail. The pursuit of the Grail was the pursuit of a dream, a spiritual quest. It was a lesson in life, a wonderful lesson. Lying like that, in front of everyone... - What a wanker. - Bastard. Noé? Want to say something? No. I didn't ﬁnd anything... I found nothing good, but my brother... - No, no. - Go now. Excuse me. I'm going to perform a song for you that Joseph, well... that Dad really liked. It's a song... Pull. Thanks. It's a French cowboy song that he learnt in Saskatchewan. I thought that... Noe and I did not always get on very well with him. When he sang us his old adventurer‘s things... they were... They were good moments. I sing on my horse in tune with my guitar I sing the songs of Western Canada Along the way as I go through Gravelbourg I spy a young lady with doe-like eyes Suddenly I go up to her I say to her dear miss Please give me your hand And we'll follow the sweet path She says to me dear cowboy I would like to be your cowgirl And follow you on horseback along the dusty road I'm from a big town I'm just visiting my family And I love to hear you sing I listen to beautiful songs It is these my heart loves And from far away I hear your melodies Sung to chase away my woes Put your backs into it! Come on, move it, lads! Move it! Janek, you're passive. You're watching them play. Go on! You're asleep, Kevin. Go on, carry on! On the pitch, I want to see enthusiasm. I want to see joy. There's a recession on. Folks come to the stadium to feel a bit of human warmth, social cohesion. This is one of the last places to create togetherness! What, coach? Togetherness. We're here to cheer them up, make them feel loved. Footballers are social workers. That's right! If you don't get that, you're in the wrong place. Morgan, is that yours? Morgan? ls it yours? No. It is. I recognise the ringtone. - Don't take me for a fool. - I'll switch it off. - Sorry, sir. - So I am. You're on the bench for the game. I said no mobiles. Have you thought about the preparation? It has gone on long enough. Don't you ﬁnd it annoying to hear a novice telling us what to do? We'll pull a trick, seeing as we're here. But you know what trick we want to pull? Clean out the room. With swag bags, like gypsies? Your tranquillity is over. But it was killing me, my tranquillity. Kiss me. Thieves aren't wealthy. We never get a good price for stuff. We shall be poor then. Kiss me. I'm ashamed, Juliette! I'm ashamed. But it doesn't matter. Kiss me. My little thief. Frangois is negotiating to put the play on again in November. In Namur, in Belgium, for 4 or 5 dates. That's great news! - Could you? - No. Got something else? I've decided to go back to uni. Uni? That's good. In Sweden? No. In Montpellier. Montpellier? In Montpellier... In fact, it isn't going to work, you and me? Well... No. But it worked a bit. Was it good when it worked a bit? Yes. Yes it was good. My dad was cursed at the end of his life. Did I say? No, I don't think so. He unearthed a holy relic no one should have found. He sold it secretly to a collector friend. He should never have done it. A terrible sacrilege. Just after, he had cancer, hemiplegia, court cases, his house burned down. An awful curse, basically, and he died. I didn't know. |‘m sorry. I think he passed it on to me and my brother, this curse. But, Galaad, curses don't exist! Why would it be passed on anyway? It's like in Sophocles' plays: the father does something bad, the kids pay for it. I don't think so. - Galaad? - What's the problem then? Fernandez intervenes. He stays for a minute. Fernandez attacks. He moves up the pitch. He's going to pass to Tigana. Tigana is in centre-forward position. Tigana passes to Platini. Tigana gets the ball back. He shoots, and Platini is there to score! And it's a goal! Platini has scored! The stadium is going wild! Did you like it? Ah yes. Thanks. It was delicious. As I had some left, I ﬁgured that... Did it go well today? OK, average. I tried to get them to work on the 4-4-2, but they didn't seem very receptive. You're going to win the match. I don't know. I can feel it. And what are you doing now? - Now? - Yes. I'm going over old games, I still have tons of work. Would you like to have dinner sometime soon? Yes. Of course. Great. I'm glad. Right... Mr Tadoussac? Could you come with me? 'Triglycerides, 188, 700..." I don't understand. I told you, they're just numbers. Do you believe in curses? - No. - In your profession, it's normal. I believe in them more and more. I'm so unlucky that it seems suspicious. I read about the problem on the internet. You know, the internet... If you read something, you know you can be cured. I read that lymph nodes in the stomach and thorax, is really pretty bad. Phase 3, apparently. I know there's a phase 4, but anyway. And what if I don't want to have chemotherapy? I can't force you. I don't want to be in pain like last time. And if it is a curse, chemotherapy won't save me. - I have to ﬁnd the source. - The source? I think you should think about it before making a decision. You can reach me any time. And your friends and family can help you. Do you have someone to talk to? No. No one. I did have my father, but he didn't listen. I won't change my mind though. It's perfectly clear to me. I have to be operational. We've got a new play. It's good to carry on your activities, Galaad. It's important for your morale. What's the play? A Moliére. Mo|iére‘s good. You said it wouldn't be painful. I'm not going to feel much, am l? You're going to be tired, feel dizzy... I'll be tired, all right. Goodbye. Take care, Galaad. "Distance and deﬁance "are the two mammaries "of contemporary individualism." There. Right... What's he trying to tell us, Marcel Gauchet? OK. Great. I hear you're talking politics? No. Not at all. I want them to know what's at stake. So they improve a bit, so we all improve together. Oh yeah? With Janek, don't let the situation get worse. Hang on. For me, it's clear. He's gained 15 kg. If he's not good in training, he can't play. It must mean there's a problem. In Poland, he was scoring 30 goals a season. I pay him. He's costing me money! He says he misses Warsaw. Noé, he told me his problem is you. You humiliate him, you don't respect him. ls that so? What's he doing here? He said that? Playing against a big League 1 club is great. But it's a pain in the ass too. The mayor and press are hassling me. They're all crazy. - I can't mess up, OK? - OK. I have to be able to count on my team. This 2nd-round match is a moment of truth. For sure. When no one else wanted you, because of your problems, I lent you money. - I'll pay you back. - No, no. I just want to know if I can count on you. Hang on! Can I count on you? It isn't fucking normal that the star player won't speak to the coach! Boris, I'm feeling really good. I've longed for an opportunity like this. See you. - All right? - Great. Do you meet girls? A bit. With the big game coming up, I'm too busy though. And your health's OK? Yeah. What did you want to tell me? Why did you come to see me? My idea about the Grail, I think it's proving true. Me and you are victims of the same curse as Dad. Are you having problems at the moment? I'm sorry, but things are pretty good for me. In the championship, we're not great... But in the Coupe de France, we're making club history. I'm fairly well paid. I've got contacts in Spain. - No, honestly... - OK. It's just me. It's taken unbelievable proportions. Come on... You're not doing so badly. In your play, I hear you were very good. - You had a main part. - I'm 40 and I've built nothing. I do second-rate theatre. Nothing works. It hasn't for two years. Since he died, it's worse. It's got nothing to do with it. - Why would it be worse? - Because. Because we're not doing what we ought to. At the end, he asked us to return the Grail. He never mentioned it to me. He didn't give you a cassette with the instructions? No. No. I don't know. - But I'm going to do it. - What are you going to do? Call his collector friend, a complete bastard, and tell him to give us back the Grail? - 12 euros, please. - No. - You're going to nick it? - Have a good evening! Yes. - You are? - Yes. And I ﬁgured with your experience... - You can't be serious! - I'm doing it for Dad too. I'm sure you're moved too. Your life isn't exactly blooming. Look, I'm gonna go. You know what? I didn't even want to see you. It's family business. You're not my brother. You never have been. We didn't grow up together, I don't know you, so get lost! If you're a loser, you're a loser. But so are you, Noé. In your third division club. With your wife who left you. Don't try to say otherwise. - We're two losers, period. - I'm not listening! We're two big losers! Momo! You have to turn more when you water. Or you soak the earth and it becomes muddy. Whereas what I want you to do is wet the grass, so as not to soak the pitch. You have to spray it, OK? The other team won't be able to kick the ball far. - You get the difference? - Not really. Ta-dah! Ah no. You shouldn't have. It's really kind of you but... - Want me to try? - No, I'll manage. There we go. It's really nice... It's an African lucky charm. Right. It's a collar. You have to wear it around your neck. Well, thanks. Thanks a lot. I've brought you two spoons. - Are you OK? - Yes, I'm ﬁne. It's just a bit humiliating, but it'll be OK. - I'm really sorry. - Sorry about what? Being like this. You're happy in your solitude. You're afraid people will bother you, right? Don't worry, Noe. They'll end up leaving you alone. - Want me to give it back? - No. Keep it. You'll need it. You look good. It's great. No one will recognise you. It makes me look a bit... For a journalist, I don't look weird? No. So he doesn't recognise your voice, what's your plan? I'm going to fake an accent. All right. I was thinking... It's like in that show. The guy is alone in front of the camera. He has to open up. And meanwhile, I search the place. ls he the type to open LIP? A bit, obviously. It's good. Your plan could work. I have to ﬁnd someone to help me. It's a two-man job. For the journalist, it's more credible. If you're two, you have to be coordinated. It becomes more technical. Won't you help me? I just deal hash, me. I'm not a burglar. Don't want to evolve? Ah no. Know any burglars around here? No. You must be kidding. Do you? Yes. I know one, but he won't help me. - My brother. My half-brother. - Your brother? And he won't help you? Sad, isn't it? We didn't grow up together. And then, it was too late. Gentlemen... On each of these medals, there's the face of a worker that Sogitec is laying off. There are 72. I couldn't feature them all, but tonight I would like you to think of these unemployed workers and their families. Two have already committed suicide. Yours and yours. Tonight. we'll surpass ourselves for them. Go. Go, Janek! Come on! It doesn't matter. You'll do it! Come on, don't worry! Stop watching them play! Janek! All you have to do is pass for fuck's sake! Keep it up! You've got a nice little team. I'm really counting on a burst of pride. Monday. I'll give them an earful. It won't be easy, Noé. We have to count on those who want it. We need winners, people who make us win. Yes. For you, it's the end of the road. |‘m sorry. I spoke to management. We all feel the team needs a fresh start. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! All right? I'm sorry... Such behaviour and lack of consideration! To entangle himself in an engagement like that! Ah, rash youth! - Your servant, sir. - Good morning, Scapin. You are thinking of your son's conduct. Yes, I acknowledge that it grieves me deeply. Sir, life is full of troubles; and we should always be prepared for them. I was told the saying of an ancient philosopher which I have never forgotten. What was it? That if a father has been away from home, he ought to dwell upon all the sad news that may greet him on his return. He ought to fancy his money stolen, his wife dead, his son crippled. - A bit more like this? - I don't know. Do you think it's good? Me, I'm bored stiff. It's cold. Don't you get it? People have a hard time all day. We're here to entertain them. This is a comedy. You're bringing us down. If you don't want to act, say so and I'll ﬁnd someone else. No, but... What was that, Galaad? I can't hear you. Sorry. For me, Scapin is someone pretty gloomy, actually. I think he's very, very gloomy. Totally disgusted even. - That's guy's such a jerk! - I don't care about being sacked. - Oh yeah? - Yeah, it isn't important. Me too, I... I'm bound to be fired. For weeks, they've been waiting for me to mess up. I heard the result on the radio. You were lousy. I had a good laugh. Yes, we really screwed up. But you're OK though? Thanks. Your acting career will take off eventually. I don't think so. You've got potential. You just have to work on your frame of mind. I don't know. In any case, I'm leaving. Where are you going? I'd like to take off abroad. Drop everything. Go to the Great North, for instance. Just get up one day, walk out the house and leave for good, like Rimbaud. Yeah well, Rimbaud did that and he got gangrene. Right. So... what's the plan? The plan's simple. We introduce ourselves as cable TV journalists interested in the Adventurers' Club. I take care of Del Sarto by interviewing him. Hang on. And... - He won't recognise us? - No. We're made up. With wigs and beards. You, meanwhile, walk around his house supposedly taking pictures, then you grab the Grail and put it... in this big bag. Quite simply. Then we go to the Pyrenees. We ask his old guide to take us to La Roche. We follow the instructions on the tape, which are very clear. We ﬁnd the cave, leave the Grail, go home and that's it. Yeah, OK... There are still a few things to work out. I can't play the old pro... Yes, you can. - You're the pro. - I don't know what he told you. Dad told me you got done for burglary. No. I got dumped on the phone by a girl I loved when I was in Holland, in a lousy club, as a substitute in Utrecht. - You played in Holland? - Yes. Left-back. I took a car and came back to France. I broke into her house and smashed up the place. And then? Then... I met the wrong people, I carried on a bit, but it wasn't really me. - You were heartbroken. - Yes. Right, Galaad. Your plan's shit. It won't work. If we want the Grail, we need to be much more methodical and ambitious. For the next adventurers' do, we have to be ready. Del Sarto invites hundreds of people. It's the perfect moment. We're going to gatecrash? Something like that. First, we have to get to the manor. You disguise me, I slip into the party incognito. Can't I come with you? No. We need 1 person inside and 1 outside. - Sure about this? - We stick to our plan. Next, I have to get upstairs. That's the hardest part. Del Sarto never leaves his manor unguarded. There's a guard at the bottom of the stairs. Say you're looking for the loo. I'll try to ﬁnd something better. Noé? You were invited? Yes, yes. How are you? Well? Well, not really. You seem... I was looking for the loo. The loo? I think it's that way. Are you sure? I've just been. OK. Great. - Ever been to Del Sartds? - No. I went several times with Dad. I was 6 or 7. It could have changed. On the 2nd ﬂoor, there's a small museum where he keeps his most precious pieces. Let's hope the Grail is there. There's probably a security code. Shit! I didn't think of that. It isn't a big deal. With a hacker box, you can pirate it fast. What's that? It's for hacking security systems. Ah, right. And what do I do? You work out the exit scenario. Good evening. Hello... What are you doing there, sir? I was cleaning the grounds, for the party, before the light show. Could you wait here a minute? Gabriel, could you come outside? It's because... Once I'm upstairs and the mattress is inﬂated, it becomes much simpler. - We just have to be precise. - OK. We'll have rehearsed every step. Yes, that's good. Inside, there'll definitely be a detection device. An alarm or something. I'll try to neutralize it, but I'm not too optimistic. They'll catch us! You see me as Arséne Lupin? Yes. A bit, actually. Don't worry. With the party in full swing, the time it takes for the alarm to go off and them to check, we'll have a good two minutes, maybe even three. You don't realize but two minutes is loads for what we have to do. - What if the Grail isn't there? - Well, then... Noé? We're dead. I take the Grail, open the window, jump and we leg it. Noé? Noé? A complication. Don't be a fool, give it back to me. Sorry, I'm taking it. You'll get nowhere that way. Nowhere? You reckon? Move it! They went this way! Find! Wait for me! Give me the Grail and I'll jump! It'll get broken. - Are you kidding? - Do I look like I am? One's over there! This is the best on the market. It's the new Twister Plus PZ from Campingaz, still with the Piezo ignition. It's a bit more technical. With the Easy Click connection, a quarter turn and it's ﬁxed to the cartridge. That's good. Want an energy drink? I bought lots. No. Can you hand me the Grail? - The Grail? - Yes. Be really, really careful. It's very ﬁne. Very simple, like this... Very beautiful. Dad must be starting to be pleased with us. Yes. He must have wondered if we would do it. Yes. He must be really happy. You reckon he's watching us and applauding? Yes. You're seriously nuts. If it comforts me to think that, aren't I allowed? I'm going to faint, you're a pain. You're not going to faint. I feel weak from time to time. Do you have health problems? At the moment, a bit, yes. Oh shit! He had a minor alert. We're going to keep overnight in observation. What's wrong with him? I can't tell you what's in his ﬁle. Because of professional secrecy? Precisely. Yes? - All right? - OK. I'm recuperating. What did they say? Apparently, my blood pressure dropped. They didn't say anything else? No. Noé? Yes? I'm quite sick actually. I've had a relapse. Why didn't you say anything? I didn't know how. I was afraid it would push us apart. You're stupid. It won't push us apart. What do the doctors say? Same as last time. It's lymphoma. There's a chance I'll get over it but it's... a pretty small chance, though. I need treatment and I have to be lucky. Right. Well... you have your treatment and we'll return the Grail. As for luck, you'll see, it'll be ﬁne. You reckon it may help? Yes. Of course. Right... I'm going IO buy |-'|'5quipe. Want anything? L‘Equipe is perfect. You're stubborn! I don't care what he says, if you heard it. No. It's best if you listen to what he had to say. It was for you too. Once we'd retrieved the Grail, it got more complicated. It's farther on. Hang on. When I told him I wanted to sell the Grail, I sensed that Ramuntxo would never forgive me. So, to ease his conscience, I pretended to be overcome with remorse. I really feel this remorse now. One evening, I went back to see him and told him I had returned the Grail to the cave, where we'd found it. When you go see Ramuntxo to ask him to take you to the Crusaders' Rock, don't say a word about the Grail. Not to him or his daughters. They all think this business was settled years ago. For sure, it isn't very... He was a bit of a bastard. Like with us. He was always lying. Really? To my mum, he lied all the time. With my mum, he let her hope. He said he'd come back. It isn't much better. No. It isn't. |‘m sorry. I didn't think it was hard for you. Sometimes, we'd drive past your house and insult you. Not often. But I have the impression I spent whole weekends doing that. Yes. I saw you. I even gave you the V-sign. With the reﬂection, I didn't see you. As I told you, he isn't in great shape. But he'll be pleased to see you. The Crusaders' Rock. A big rock. No? Doesn't ring a bell? With the path to it. - He's totally gaga. - He's a bit old. Stay for dinner? My sister will be home soon. She'll be pleased. As your dad seems a bit tired, we need another guide. So I don't really know if... - But still... - My other sister is a guide. Pantxika. She's with a group of Norwegians, but she could take you. - When's she back? - In two or three days. There are no other guides. The Crusaders' Rock is hard to find. This is nonsense. We have to go there, damn it! We're waiting for her sister. If we set out alone, with the little info we have... Joseph's tape describes what comes after the rock. He thought someone would take us that far. We could have slept elsewhere. You just make decisions behind my back. She kindly offered. They're the family of one of Dad's closest pals. I'm feeling low anyways. I'm going to take a shower. Don't undress in front of me. - And in the change rooms? - You're not one of my players. I'm really pleased you say that. It means I'm special to you. It's delicious. Thanks. It's good you want to retrace your father's steps. It isn't a pilgrimage. But it's important we see some of the places. You didn't come to try and get the Grail? No, no. Your dad was wise to put it back. It mustn't be touched. What do you do, if you're not adventurers? I train a football club in the CFA. It's the fourth division. They're professionals. Galaad is an actor. Very, very talented. He's playing Scapin soon. You should come see him. That's good. Amané is an artist too. She paints. She did the portrait of your dad and ours. She's really good. I was 15. The picture's rubbish. No, it's very good. Are you planning to stay awhile after your trek? We don't have time. Galaad longs to see the Great North, and I'm off to Spain to coach a club near Valladolid. We're doing this together then going our separate ways. The cake. He's decided to teach you Basque. You don't have to accept. What's your sister showing the Norwegians? She's taking them on a tour of the mountain. There's a special Grail tour. We take them to the Crusaders' Rock and tell them the legend. Aren't they literature students? Archaeology. She's not showing them the cave? No. Dad hasn't even taken us to the cave. We don't know where it is. It only appears to pure hearts anyway. Not too cold? What did you say? | said .. . ls |t warm?" Yes. And 100% natural. Not like a swimming pool. No. I have a portrait you did of our father. It's very beautiful. What about you? - When's your play on? - I don't have one. My brother was talking nonsense. I'm getting out of theatre. Whenever I played a character, he became totally morbid. Morbid characters are good too. - Want to come in? - In the water? Ah no. No. I don't have trunks. I won't look at you. I'll close my eyes. Besides, I'm not a very good swimmer. It's really shallow. Look, I can stand. And I think I have an allergy. Really? In fact, it's a serious illness. So... What's all this nonsense? I promise you. I'm very ill. It's big here. I got lost. We said 8 o'clock. - He's been going on for an hour! - I'm sorry. Honestly, we have to go. They're nice but I can't hang about here. Were you serious about Spain? Not really. - You're a pathological liar. - Give me a break! If I stay one more day, I'm going to fall in love. Let's go then. If you want to leave everything, you can't get attached. Don't you want to stay till tomorrow? You'll get rained on. It's a shame. We'll pop in on the way back. Bon voyage! You're going to break it. - Do you realise it's magic? - Of course. Imagine what we could do if we kept it with us. - What do you want to do? - I don't know. Burglaries? No. A circus number? You see. Come on. I think they're Pottoks. The prehistoric horses they have around here. Yes. I'm going to take a picture. I don't like pictures, but I'm going to take one. Oh fuck! Noé? Noé! Galaad? Galaad! Galaad! You're so unreliable! Galaad! Galaad! It's hard not knowing if you're doing things for the last time. Yes, we never know if we're doing things for the last time. But when you're sick... that's what you think about. Pretty much all the time. You're afraid of not making the most of life, of not being good enough. And you know the world isn't going to stop turning. Everything will carry on... without you. Yes. That isn't easy either. Where were you? I looked everywhere. I was really worried! I got lost, I was over there. And you? I was higher up, with a sheep. - It's a long story. - I saw a tiny Pegasus. The family is reunited! Good morning. Pantxika, Ramuntxds youngest daughter. I'm taking my QFOLIP to the Crusaders' Rock. Galaad said you'd like to go. - Come with us. - Yes. However, it's a day's walk. - Fine. OK. Sami, we're off. Will it work? A machine for ﬁnding the Grail? I think not. It'll beep if there's something. You're ruining the ambience. Scandinavians make me sad. - You had a Scandinavian? - Franco-Scandinavian. You can't keep... Huh? You have to see beyond it. It's an old Swedish song. All right? Sleep well? Right, we're here. No. You're... here. Right. We're taking them east to show them some tombs. To reach the cave, go behind the rock then right. The cave is... that way. It's another 6 or 7 hours' walk. - Be careful. You'll be on your own. - No problem. Right. Safe journey. He says he follows a wild and turbulent stream then goes through a deep, dark forest. - It isn't this cave, then? - No. Looks like we have to go on. We have to go... There's a stream over there. Maybe that's the dark stream? Turbulent. It could be. I don't fucking know! He mentioned a big mossy trunk across the path. Yes, but maybe it's gone, the mossy trunk. Maybe this isn't even the right stream. Are you OK? It always makes me anxious, being lost. - You're not going to faint? - No, I'm OK. Well? Nothing! No big mossy trunk. - How about you? - Nothing either! It's late. Let's ﬁnd somewhere to camp! - You want to camp? - Yes! Me too! What are you thinking about? Death. - Great. - Isn't it? I don't know. You could try thinking of positive things. The trips you'll take, theatre... I'm quitting theatre. You shouldn't. It's dumb. Do you ever listen? I already told you I'd lost interest in it. I said theatre. It could be something else. It's important to visualise something that does you good. Illness is in the mind too. Sorry, but cancer isn't just a problem of attitude. I wish it were, because I'm actually motivated. I just wanted to help you. With football-coach psychology? You know what? We'll return the Grail, and then that's it. I never want to hear of you again. Me neither. - Goodnight. - Yeah right! Noé, is that you? Noé! Noé! Fuck! Fuck! - We just have to wait for him to go. - Yeah. - Are you cold? - A bit. Don't worry. He won't stay long. What's he up to? I don't believe this. - What a dumb bear! - Guarding the Grail? Course not! The legend mentions a bear. Rubbish! He's staying there. That's all. Listen. You've got your life ahead of you. I've got nothing. But I'm the most athletic. I should expose myself. All right then. But if he grabs you, make sure you don't struggle. I read that bears aren't mean. They just attack to see who they're dealing with. No way am I going to ﬁght. I lure it then climb a tree. I read that bears climb trees. - I'll lose him. - They're fast. Galaad, just stop! Sprinting, I can still handle a bear. Maybe he'll leave if he sees us. I think bears are fearful. Well, quite evasive. Dad told me. - He did? - I think so. Here. Look! It's magic too. Go fetch! No? Oh fuck! I've got the Grail! Noé! Not so loud. I'm here. I've got the Grail! Noé! I got beaten up like this once, during a burglary that went wrong. See, you've seen worse. Yeah. You could say that! Ah, well... It should be this cave. - Are you sure? - No. There must be a magic thing or something. Grail. show us the way. On the tape, he says we'll ﬁnd a torch. See? It's accurate. These torches are 800 years old. Imagine that! - All right? Are you coping? - Fine. Tell me if you feel dizzy or want to take a break. I'm ﬁne. Galaad! Are you OK? |‘m not sure. Hang on. Here! Try to hang on to this! Did you see? I didn't faint. Here. Drink this. It's hot Gatorade. It should give you a boost. Thank God you had the Grail. It's a sign. You have to go on. It's straight on. You can't go wrong. In the cave, you'll see a walkway over a chasm that's quite deep. Wow! Take it. As far as I recall, the wood is very slippery. On the other side of the... OK, don't panic. ...walkway, you'll see a rudimentary altar built by the Crusaders. The stone was hollowed out to hold the Grail. This is its receptacle. I want you to put it in there. I'm counting on you now. Thank you. Did you do it? That's it then. Yes, that's it. I really thought you were going to die on me. Me too. I saw myself dead. With my disgusting drink... Do you think things will be OK now? Yes. The curse, in any case, is over. Now I just have to get better. Maybe when we get down there you'll already be better. Maybe, yes. Subtitles: Eclair Group
