Miss Hong Eun-jo! Are you waking up? Doctor! Can you see me? You might have a headache. You can see me, right? The lady's conscious, but the mister isn't waking up. It's too late. He's dead. We need to identify him and contact his family. The time of death, August 17, 11:59 pm. His name... Do you know his name? This was found at the scene. Looks like his. All right. Mr. Ji Ho-min has passed away. (Incheon District Court) (No Mercy for Violent Crimes! Overturn Court Ruling!) Sorry I'm late. Morning. I don't know if we can keep this up. You're always here but no one's interested. No one cares. It didn't happen to them. They think you just got unlucky. That scumbag's having a swell time at the hospital. (Murderer with Dementia in Treatment) (Mother of deceased child continues to protest) I should do this, right? Don't feel too bad. It's all my fault. (My name is Ji Ho-min. I'm so sorry…) (August 17, 2018 Time) (Friday, August 17) (Don't forget, we meet today at noon. Depressed Teddy) This is really important to mommy. But mommy will let you have it, Ye-eun. Here. Thank you. Is this everyone? We have one more. Someone called Pponyangi. Kids these days have no sense of time. Hello, Pponyangi? Where are you? We're all here. I'm waiting at exit 5. We'll pick you up. Why don't you stay there? Then, can you see me? I've raised my hand. I'm sorry. I didn't see your text. Can I get in? Sure. Speaking of the weather, some of you might already have seen the news. There's going to be the first meteor shower in seven years. At dawn tomorrow and the day after, we'll be seeing lots of falling stars. Ideally, twenty to thirty meteors an hour will be visible to the naked eye. (Hyangiram Temple) This is the men's quarters. You don't mix bibimbap with a spoon. You have to use chopsticks. Oh... I see. I think I'll go take a walk. So, Pponyangi... Why do you want to kill yourself? You don't have to tell me. We all have our reasons. Hey, what if... This is a big if. What if we had met as two normal people? What would that have been like? We're not here for a holiday. We should get back. They'll be waiting. Wait. I'm just wondering. What if? There are no ifs in life. It's July 7 of the lunar calendar. It's about time they fell. If only I hadn't met that manager, or signed that contract... What's your story? I want to follow Ye-eun. She was my daughter. Start handing out the drugs. We don't have time. Right. I can't swallow pills. Just do it. One at a time. We're going to see some rain showers next week. Good luck with the summer heat, and have a good night. This has been the August 17 broadcast of Between the Night and Music. The lady's conscious, but the mister isn't waking up. It's too late. He's dead. We need to identify him and contact his family. The time of death, August 17, 11:59 pm. His name... Do you know his name? This was found at the scene. Looks like his. All right. Mr. Ji Ho-min has passed away. I'm sorry. Until I recognize you... Wait for me. What was that? (Don't forget, we meet today at noon. Depressed Teddy) Depressed Teddy? And Princess, right? Pponyangi? I was about to send you our changed location. But you got here just fine. How did you know it was us? Why are you staring at me like that? I'm sorry. But haven't we met before? No, I've never met you. Is there something wrong? It's nothing. Wasn't there someone else coming? Hey... I'm so sorry. I'm not going. I think it's no use. Let's get going. We should hurry up. Take this. Thanks. Good luck with the summer heat, and have a good night. This has been the August 17 broadcast of Between the Night and Music. Oh my god! -Sis! -What's the date today? It's August 10. What is this about? You're not here for a Tarot reading. Mi-jo. I died, then came back. What? So what you're saying is... You're gonna kill yourself in a week. When you wake up, it's the day before, and then the day before that? Yes. Get up. Let's get you to a doctor. I swear I'm not crazy. Pick three. Karma. You're tied down by things of the past. See these two wolves? Two people are waiting for you. And... The Nameless What does that mean? Reincarnation, and death. See the scythe? This means... You have to resolve things and make your way through. I disappear at midnight, and wake up where I was yesterday. The day it was sunny, the day the forecast was wrong... I'm definitely reliving my yesterdays. Make sure you wear sunscreen today. The seasonal rain belt has taken a seat back. It will not rain in the central regions... You're wrong. The mid-northern areas will continue to be hot... If I keep going back, will I see Ye-eun again? Two, three. (Trash) Yes, sir? -Journalist Hong. -Sir? How long will you keep this up? This. We've been tolerant. It's time you quit, okay? Don't you think we've been getting pressured? Our reporters might lose their court access. You're not the only one with things to do! Ever heard about give and take? It's not like you can bring back a dead kid. You're so consistent. -Like tomorrow, like today. -What? What did you say? I said I was sorry. (No Mercy for Violent Crimes! Overturn Court Ruling!) I don't know if we can keep this up. But I have to. No one cares. It didn't happen to them. They think you just got unlucky. That scumbag's having a swell time at the hospital. (Murderer with Dementia in Treatment) (He smiled when we asked him why he did it!) You're right. Standing out here every day... It changed nothing. This time travel gives me courage. I can't forgive him. Mr. Ji Ho-min, do you have a minute? Oh, sure. (My name is Ji Ho-min. I'm so sorry…) (Special Care Unit) Ji Ho-min. Why is he here? (July 23, 2017 Ye-eun) If you brought any pictures, you can leave them here. No. I'm all right. Ye-eun, I'll see you tomorrow. I mean, yesterday. (I miss you, Mommy) I was in Gangneung the day I lost Ye-eun. I need to know what exactly happened. This time, I'm going to save her. Taxi! Where to? Seoul. Hop in. Thank you. Cheonghak Children's Camp, please. Huh? What's going on? Dad. Dad. Dad! Dad! No way... Dad? Dad! Ouch! I told you not to go outside. I have an interview today. I just managed to take a day off. This is a rental! -Oh my god… -I have to give this to Ho-min. Hello, teacher? -Ms. Hong? -Where is Ye-eun right now? Just a second, please. I'm told she's still taking her nap. What's the matter? Please go to her. I'm on my way there. Stay by her side and don't let her go anywhere! All right. Is something the matter? Something's going to happen. Don't let her out of your sight, okay? Ho-min should eat eggs and practice judo. I told you I quit. Ho-min's good at shoulder throws. I'm tagging along. -I said no. -I have to go. I have to give Ho-min some eggs. It's dangerous outside. But... Mister, let me go. I have to give Ho-min eggs. Please let me go. I have to give Ho-min some eggs. Mister, I have to go. Ho-min needs eggs. Please. -I have to... -Dad. Don't come back, then. It's too hard for me. Mister, I have to go. I have to give him eggs. (No Running) This is police officer Kim Do-yool. Please hurry to Cheonghak Children's Camp! What's your concern? An old man with dementia might kill a child! Are you there right now? No, I'm on my way. Officer, just please hurry! What's that? A patrol request, but she sounds deranged. Hello? Just keep going. -What? -Please. But it's the red light... I'm running out of time, please! Ms. Hong? Where is my Ye-eun? She was right here... The pool! Oh... No! Ye-eun! No, Ye-eun! Ye-eun! Ye-eun... Slow and steady. Ye-eun... Ye-eun... Ye-eun, are you all right? Why are you here, Mommy? Because I wanted to see you. I'm sorry I'm late. Did you give us that call? He's the culprit. He's the one who tried to kill my daughter. He saved me. What? I saw it, too. He tried to save her. No. Do you have any family? Ho-min. I have to give him eggs. Dad... Are you all right? I'm sorry. Let's go home and give him eggs. Okay? Let's go. I need to give him eggs. Mr. Ji Ho-min. Wait. You are...? Ho-min's eggs... I'm the mother of the child from the camp. Oh, you must have been scared. Don't we know each other? -Have we met? -Ho-min's eggs... Excuse us. -I have to give Ho-min eggs. -You can do that at home. Be careful. I have to give him eggs. Good job. All done? Yay! Why don't you write Mommy a letter? (Mommy, don't cry.) When did I cry? Mommy doesn't do that. Read it later. Why did you write tomorrow's date? Today is July 19. (Mommy, don't cry.) (Ye-eun, I'll see you tomorrow. I mean, yesterday.) The journal was following me to the past. Hey, you surprised me! You look pretty, Mommy. You think this is pretty? I'm a goblin, here to catch you! Hong Ye-eun! Let's hide. Mommy. It's like I'm dreaming. Ye-eun came back to life. But time keeps moving backwards. Now, I'm ready for tomorrow. Is there nothing I can do? She's an angel only when she sleeps. I never thought we'd have drinks together. It's like there's an opening now. An opening? You should have done this earlier. -It's great. -I've been too busy. It's been chaos since Ye-eun was born. Anyway. I'll forget everything when yesterday comes. But you need to make up your mind. Otherwise, you'll regret it. This is an opportunity to do what you wanted to do. Mi-jo. Why do you believe everything I say? I don't believe in time travel, but I believe you. -Do you remember? -What? When I was in ninth grade. You were playing the piano. Our drunk stepdad suddenly opened the door. He tried to hug me, saying I was pretty. Remember what you said? What did I say? Take your dirty hands off her. Right now. Did I? Mom was just sitting there. When you said that, she got really mad. So, you packed your things and got me out of that house. You were kinda cool. I don't know what I was thinking back then. From that moment on, I knew that... You're the only one I can trust. But if we ever go back... Let's not leave. Let's just stay with Mom. She probably just wanted to survive. I'll think it over. I wonder what's waiting for me yesterday. What should I do, Mi-jo? Did I get taller? Maybe? What about now? Hey, this won't make you taller. I have to try my best. -I'm this tall! -You're so adorable. December 24, 2011. The day my precious Ye-eun was born. The second time wasn't any easier. You've done it. Ten fingers and toes, all normal. Congratulations. It's 11:30, right? It is. -We have to weigh her. -Give me 30 minutes. Let me be with her. Ye-eun... Hello. Ye-eun... I'll do my best. (June 27, 2011 Depressed Teddy) My name is Ji Ho-min. I'm so sorry... It was my father's dementia. I deeply apologize to Hong Ye-eun and her family. It all happened because of me. Please forgive my father. Depressed Teddy, Ji Ho-min. He apologized to me from the bottom of his heart. But I didn't even say sorry. Ji Ho-min... (Depressed Teddy's Blog) (Yeosu's Night Sky Webmaster Benjamin) Benjamin? Yeosu? (Cultivate innovative talents) Pponyangi? You made it just fine. Do you recognize me? Gosh... You keep going back, too? Treat me as your elder. I'm actually 78 years old. 78? Why did time start going backwards? I don't know. For me, it started when I tried to hang myself. -I think that set things off. -But there has to be a reason. I've tried to come up with the answer. I lived like an idiot. Maybe I've been given a second chance. What should we do now? It's simple. Keep living until we're inside the womb. Then, we'll disappear like we've never been. No. Ye-eun... I have to find a way back. That's actually why I went to the temple. Seven meteors fell that night. When constellations readjust their positions tiny openings are created. What do you mean? Come with me. You don't have to be so thorough. There's nothing unusual. Am I really going to become a singer? Of course you are. Your turn. Here's the ink. Stamp it right there. Right here? Mr. President, what kind of contract is this? Registered Executive Director? Yeah. Don't get it? As the executive, you'll be part of our family. You wanna be a singer or not? Stamp it. Translated by @mentahkr -Who are you? -The stamp... This is an important moment for me. -Give it back. -It sure is! The one you'll regret the most. I don't know what you're talking about. That guy is a crook. She wants to sing! You wanna be a singer or not? I do. Get out! -Go on. -Get out now! -I'm sorry. -We can print it out again. Just stamp it! So, you're travelling back in time. -What evidence... -There's none. -Are you... -I'm not crazy. I don't need a doctor. -Then... -You want a prediction? In 2018, there'd be inter-Korean summit and a declaration. Make use of that if you can. Does this mean... reunification? You make the same joke every single time. This is fun. -You're here. -Hello, where you want to put this Please leave it over there. Depressed Teddy. Thank you. Excuse me. Can I have your business card? Sure, just a second. If you need any repairs, give me a call. Nice to meet you. Sorry? Okay, thank you. Welcome. Take your time browsing. Ma'am, I saw you. You scratched this with your car key. You think I'm crazy? Why would I do that? Ho-min! Hello, ma'am. -Oh my gosh. -Sorry, he's new. Let me apologize. Don't you know how much my mom bought from this store? Ho-min, say you're sorry. -What? -Come on, quick. Wow... You're just trying to get a lower price! If he keeps this up, I'm returning everything. -We're leaving. -Let's discuss this... Ma'am! You scratched this to make it cheaper. Just now... You should check the security camera. She scratched it with her car key. And then... -How dare you! -It's your lucky day. I'm suing you for defamation. What's this now? Hey! The Nameless. Your road will come to an end. Death is looming close by. Tell me your inner thoughts, and your destiny... Destiny? So what? Can you change it? If he recognizes me, or I prevent his misery... Will time flow normally? At least I know his neighborhood. Hey. Why are you following me? Sorry? And what was that about? Most importantly, who are you? See, I... I came from the future. What? I believe you're the reason my Ye-eun came back. But now I don't have much time. I have to reverse time before she disappears. Besides... I can't forget what you said to me. Me? You told me to wait until you recognized me. I'm not the kind of person who says those things, okay? Maybe if I change your unhappy past things will be different. Tell me. What happened? What makes you think I'm unhappy? I was there. The day you died. What? Is your father doing well? (Resume) Nice to meet you. I'm Ji Ho-min. Hello. Seems like you injured your shoulder. Yes, but... It will be better by next month. Will be? We're a furniture shop. You need to carry heavy stuff. But right now... How did your interview go? Sorry? Well, it was just... Who are you? I also had an interview. Oh... Why are you asking? I think I failed. Wanna go for a drink, as interview mates? -What? -My treat. Come on. This was your idea, but you're not drinking. I told you, I'm pregnant. Why can't you believe me? I'm at ten weeks. This is so strange. How are we getting along so well? It feels like we've known each other for a long time. I have known you for a long time. Are you flirting with me? What? This has never happened to me before. It feels so weird. I know it feels weird. I feel weird every single day. Hey... Are you really pregnant? Yeah. Then I suppose you're married. There's no dad. -Why not? -We broke up. For real? It's because I'm bad-tempered. Even so... No, no. Listen to me. A guy won't take care of his girl and their baby? This just can't be allowed! He doesn't know. I didn't tell him. I have an idea. Listen. I can pretend to be your boyfriend in front of that scumbag. -It'll be fun. -What did I say? You don't have to do anything for me. You never said that. Give me your phone. Huh? Ji Ho-min? That's me. And that's my phone number. This is where I had the interview today. -Do I get hired? -Yes, you do. Really? -But how... -You gave this to me. Really? How do you know me? Guess how many times I've told you that? A lot of times. But tomorrow, you won't remember. I'm headed to the past, and you're headed to the future. Next time I meet you, you won't remember me. That's impossible. Sometimes, it gets hard. Let me get this straight. You... Wait a minute. Eun-jo. You've known me from the future to this day? Right. Then... What's the future me like? The future you... He's cool. There's nothing cool about me. What if you could know what happens tomorrow? Eun-jo. In life... There are no ifs. What did you say? -What? -What did you say just now? There are no ifs in life. Why? You think that's funny? Why are you delighted? Will today's you remember me? Will yesterday's you recognize me? Hold on. Go, Ho-min. You're the star. Ho-min, you can win. Nail that shoulder throw. -What are you doing? -Go, Ho-min. I have to see Ho-min's judo match. He's really good. Mister, how about a match? -Ho-min's good at judo. -Stop it. He's really good. Ho-min looks so cool doing it. -Stop it. -He's good at shoulder throws. I told you to stop! Mister, where's my Ho-min? Dad. Dad. Dad, look at me. I'm here. Get back to your senses. Why won't you recognize me? It hurts. You should comfort me. You're supposed to be the adult. How can I go on? Where's Ho-min? One half. I can't let this be the end. This match must be stopped. One minute. How many times do I have to wake you up? You have a match today! Match? What time is it? Why didn't you wake me up earlier? I made beef bone broth, your favorite. Beef bone broth for breakfast? -Come on. -Careful. Thank you for the meal. Eat up. Dad, it's too salty. I must have salted it one more time. I keep forgetting stuff. That's okay. Dad. Don't get sick until I make a lot of money. Won't be long now. Until then, you have to stick by my side. You're being unmanly! Who cares? I had a dream. You died. You ran out of the house with bare feet. You went somewhere and fell into the water. What a relief it was just a dream. What you dream is the opposite. Really? Drowning in your dream is a good omen. You might make the national team today. If only I could do that... Okay, eat up. Mr. Ji Ho-min. Mr. Ji Ho-min. You can't take part in today's match. What? You'll regret this for life. We should just leave. What are you saying? Who are you? You're going to be held down. You'll try to resist and dislocate your shoulder. You'll never be able to practice judo again. Your smile, warmth and time with your father... Everything is going to change. Ho-min, it's time. Let's go! -Gather around. -Yes, sir. Do you know how much I've waited for this moment? I'll do it, even if I'll regret it. Good luck! Ji Ho-min, go! You gotta push! That's it. Outer hook! Get him! Go, Ho-min! Ho-min, get up! Stop! Get up! Wait! Please. I'm a journalist. Ho-min, no! I couldn't stop it. Some things can't be changed, even in your second life. So? I want to build a new future for him. Even if I can't reverse time, I won't have that regret. Life doesn't go as planned. I decided to keep living after I failed that day. My parents are well. I'm happy now. It's like spring once again. Good work today. See you tomorrow. Ho-min! -How have you been? -You saw me yesterday. -We missed you. -Let's go eat. I don't have any money. We'll treat you. Just hang out with us. Let's get hamburgers. -Hamburger! -Hamburger! -Goodbye. -Where are you going? You didn't eat, right? Who is that? Let's go eat. -What on earth? -They're holding hands! Thank you. Hope you're okay with bibimbap. I am. Sorry I dragged you here. They skip after-school lessons to follow me around. And I'm no celebrity. That was why. Leave this to me. You should use chopsticks to mix bibimbap. Anyway. Haven't we met before? You look familiar. Here you go. What's wrong? Too spicy? Was it too much chili paste? No, it's good. I'm sure I've seen you before. Is there really no way to reverse time? I hope you're doing well, Ye-eun. These constellations are going to realign. That will create another opening. So, there's one more chance? Maybe I shouldn't tell you. You might die. To live again, I have to risk death. I guess you always need courage to live. You sure you wanna know? Yes. On April 1, 2011 seven meteors will fall. That's when you should try. I'm rooting for you. Thank you. (April 1, 2011 The Choice) If yesterday comes, Ye-eun will disappear forever. This might be the last day of my life. Eun-jo. Why are you already up? Eun-jo... I'm hungry. Stay for breakfast. Your eyes look alike. With yours? Yeong-min, do you love me? Yeah, of course. I'll ask one more time. Do you love me? Why are you asking? To know how I feel? Or to know how you feel? I'm just reflecting on us. I love you. I know. You were sincere. For that, I'm thankful. Yeong-min. I believe in my choice. So, you should believe in yours. Excuse me. Anyone home? -Hello? -Yes? You are...? I'm Ho-min's friend. He left early for practice today. I came here to pay my respects. Pay respects? Thank you. And I'm sorry. Hold on. Wait. This is my new hobby. You're so pretty. Can I take a picture? Okay. All right. This way. Ready? One, two, three. Excuse me, isn't there judo practice today? I think they're having a group dinner. Now for our team's ace, Mr. Ippon! Tell us your resolution, Ho-min! You're making me shy. I'll make it quick. Good work today. Let's make the best of the remaining two months. With this arm, I'll shoulder throw everyone! -Ippon! -Ippon! -Bottoms up! -Bottoms up! -Drink it. -Yeah. Why isn't he picking up? I should have prepared a plan. -Hello. -Hello? What took you so long? I kept calling you. I'm sorry. But who are you? Where are you? I don't have time. I have to see you one last time. Who are you to tell me this? I'm Hong Eun-jo. Where are you? I'll find you. I got on the bus to get home. What? Besides, it's too late to meet anyone. Hello? Huh? Hello? Hey... It's been a while. Do you recognize me? I'll make the national team this time. I'm Mr. Ippon! I'm sure of it. You'll make it. Congratulations. Thank you. Then, I'll go to the Olympics and win a gold medal. And live happily with my dad. Then... That's everything. Right? Here. Read this. Promise me that you will. I thought I could change it. I'm sorry. I'm headed to the past, but you're headed to the future. You can do it. Please become happy. 1-Apr-11 11:42 It's okay if you don't remember me. Just do well. It's time to make the most important decision of my life. Will I keep reliving the past, or run toward the future? I want to see Ye-eun by heading tomorrow. Will time reverse itself? Hong Ye-eun's existence fills me with gratitude. Where will I end up? Will tomorrow find me once more? Or will it be another yesterday? Not to die, but to live. To have no regrets. That's why I'll jump. Thanks to the warm weather, cherry blossoms are coming up north. They are already sweeping across the Chungcheong Provinces. It's going to be another warm day. Soon, cherry blossoms will be in full bloom in Seoul. This has been the weather for today, April 2, 2011. Oh no, I'm late. Dad, I'll be on my way. Ho-min. What's that? I'm getting into photography. It's quick and fun. Now go on. -Good luck, son! -Yeah! See you later. Ji Ho-min! -Time to go! -Right. Go get them! Go, Ho-min! All right now, breathe. Ten fingers and toes, all normal. Congratulations. I've been waiting for this moment. Ye-eun... Hello. (Hyangiram Temple) How have you been? Thank you for waiting. Here. Thank you. I've seen many springs and many winters. When winter ends it is always... Spring, once again. Spring, Again Ye-eun, Mommy's running late. I'll leave without you! Hong Ye-eun! Hong Ye-eun! Lee Joo-yeong. You know me? This was yours. Keep it safe. Who are you? Your husband. Are you crazy? Thanks for cooking for me and staying by my side. Even though you nagged a lot. Have a good life with someone else. I'll miss you a lot. Hey! What's your name? Benjamin.
