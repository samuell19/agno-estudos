Did you get the voice-over report? Thank you. Oh, hi, Janice. Hi. Kyle needs the Tenolin proofs ASAP. Okay, great. I'll check my e-mail. Thanks. Bye. Not a single one of those auditions moved me, so just send it out again and get me some new faces. Seriously, how hard is it to find a face to sell insurance? Well, I read over the script, and maybe nobody moved you because I felt like it was lacking a bit of heart. It's a commercial, Angie, not an Oscar movie. Seth, I need you to fly in props to set. Actually, I've got dance class in an hour. - Uh, I can do it. - Great. Is that for me? - Oh, yes. Your double espresso. - See? This is why I think we should give it another shot. Of espresso? No. Us. Because you get me, and all of this. Oh. Well, what I got is that you're not into anything serious, which is fine. I'm a changed man, Angie. I haven't been out with a woman in months. Really. Because why would I? I have you. Think about it. We could be dynamite here, together. This world could be our oyster. Props. Got to get on the props. - Hey. - Hi. You working late? Yeah. I had to step in as props coordinator. Wow. What hat don't you wear in that office? You know, honestly, I had no idea how all-encompassing working in production would be. I just thought it'd be a great way for me to get my feet wet while I work on my script, which is going to be Oscar-worthy, by the way. I have no doubts. Oh, no. The apartment I was on the waitlist for just got rented. No. Why does this keep happening? You know what they say about this city. It's impossible to find a job, a boyfriend... Both: and a place to live. Well, you have nailed three out of three. Well, part-time boyfriend, but suits me just fine. By the way, he just flew in, and he's going to be crashing here for a couple of nights. You don't mind, do you? No, of course not. It's your place. You're the best. Thanks. Alright. I got to go. I am late, as per uszh. Do not stay up working too late. Promise me. - I won't. - Okay. Bye. Bye. - Love you. - Bye. Bye. Okay. "Exterior, jungle, day." Coffee. I need coffee. Good morning. - Good morning. How'd you sleep? - Fantastic. - Beth? - Yeah? Why is Aaron wearing my bathrobe? Um, I forgot to wash the towels. Sorry. - It looks cute on him, though. - It does look cute. Please don't tell me that is work on a Sunday. - Oh, my gosh. - What? - I won! - What? I won the rental lottery. I'm going to get my own place! - Oh, my God. Really? - I'm getting my own place. I'm getting my own apartment, my own space. - She got a place! - I got a place! Louis? You watch the hockey playoffs last night? Am I alive and breathing? You want me to pick you up anything while I'm out? Nah. I'm good. Oh, hey. - Whoop! - Oh, sorry. There you go. Sorry. I'm not busting in. Don't worry. I'm moving in. To my very own... place. Well, you didn't, uh, strike me as a bandit. And even if you were, it's pretty hard to get anything past Louis there. The napping is just a cover. Can I help you bring this to the elevator? Uh, no. That's okay. Thanks, though. - You sure? - Yeah. Well, welcome to the building. Okay. You are going to thrive out here, girl. Mm-hmm. Woo! Hmm. Wow. What? Where did you come from? Angie: Hello? Hello? Is anyone missing a bird? Hello. Hello. Uh, uh... Coming. Hi. Angie Leroy? Gineen Fowler, building manager. - Hi. - Welcome. Congratulations on winning the lottery. Oh, thank you. I see you're almost all settled in. - Almost. - Great. Well, in case if you haven't had time to read my welcome e-mail, here is a hard copy of everything you need to know about the building, including my newly implemented no-pet policy, excluding fish. Because what mess do they make, really? Well, the last tenant in your unit, I will say, he respected the rule but had a nasty habit of feeding the pigeons on the balcony. And it's the reason the unit came up. I think I saw a pigeon out there. Must be a clinger-on-er, wondering where the buffet went. Hmm. Well, don't worry. I have bird control - looking into some measures. - Copy that. If you need anything, don't hesitate to ask. And remember, we're all one big family here. Copy that. I think I have something in my throat. I think I have a frog in my throat. Anyways, um, thank you so much for everything. Um, I will reach out if I have any problems. Angie: Well, what am I supposed to do with it? Well, did you call the zoo? Yeah. I called the zoo, who told me to call wildlife services, who told me to call the bird rescue place, who told me they were overcrowded. And I can't keep it here, because it's against the rules. Beth: I'm so sorry, Ang. What about a pet store? Oh, my gosh. You're a genius. A pet store. I'm going to go there now. Okay. I'll talk to you later. Bye. - Hi there. - Hi. Um, I was wondering if you could take a parrot off my hands. - What kind of parrot? - It's a blue and yellow one. Blue and gold macaw. A descendant of the Psittacidae family. Ah, yeah. Whatever. Um, so, can you take it? Sorry. Pet shops don't take in rescues. - None of them? - Nada. Uh, okay. Well, could you tell me which aisle your birdcages are in? Aisle four. Thanks. Shopping for a pet? No. No, no, no. Not at all. No. This is not for me or my new place. It's for my old roommate. She got a pet, and so, I'm picking up some stuff for her, so... What are you doing here? Fish food. Right. The only pet allowed on the list. - Or so we're told. - Mm-hmm. And we wouldn't want to break the rules, right? No. I've wanted my place for a very long time, so, I'm definitely going to be crossing all my T's and dotting all my I's. Right. Well, it's nice to run into you. - Angie. - Angie? Ted. A pleasure to officially meet you, and I'm sure I'll be seeing you around. Yeah. That you will. See me around. Oh. Well, fancy meeting you again. - Yes. - Same floor. So, what kind of fish do you have? Tropical. You know, mollies, guppies. This, uh, big old catfish. He's kind of like the Godfather of the tank. Keeps the rest of them in line. What sort of bird does your former roommate have? Parrot. Hmm. Thing doesn't shut up. Oh! - Sorry. - No. Right here. Please. After you. Oh. Well, look at that. We're neighbors. Yeah. Looks like it. Parrot: Not on your Nelly. That's my roommate. My old roommate. Not my one right now. Dropping some stuff off. Must be on the phone. Well, I'll see you around, neighbor. Yeah. Bye. Angie: Okay. I have an online ad for a free parrot and one for a lost one. Hmm. Maybe you shouldn't put it for free. You could get a lot of weirdos. You are so right about that. I just hope the owner is looking for it. I mean, this bird must've flown out of somebody's place from somewhere. Maybe it will chirp its address. Which would be so much better than the random phrases it keeps on belting out. Which, by the way, almost got me in trouble with my neighbor, who is pretty easy on the eyes. Excusez-moi. Please do tell me more. Nothing to tell, other than he's really cute. And he has a fish, so he plays by the rules. Okay. Beth, no. What are you doing? - Is that him? - Yeah. That's him. Ooh. He is cute. Oh, my God. Okay. This is perfect. I mean, you no longer have to look for a place to live. You already have a job, and hello? Right next door is a potential man. Actually, I was kind of thinking I might give Kyle another chance. Before you say no... Okay. He's not dating every woman that walks through the production office door anymore. Oh, that's good. So, does that mean he wants to get serious? I mean, it seems like it. And he's right. Our schedules complement each other, and I really don't have any time to date anymore. Okay. Well, you do what you want, but he is easy on the eyes. I know. But with that bird, I just want to remain neighborly. Because I do not want him reporting me back to Gineen, - the condo cop. - Okay. So, then, you get him a bottle. Something tropical to go with the whole tropical fish theme, and then voila. Neighborly duty is done. And then, maybe hot neighbor will invite you in for a little drink. You are relentless. I know. Hey. Hey. Everything okay? Yeah. Uh, I just wanted to bring you this. New neighbor to new neighbor. Wow. Thank you. I love a Mai Tai. I know. Who doesn't love a little tropical in a bottle? Is everything okay? Uh, yes. Yeah. Just, um, hanging a picture, and it probably fell. Hmm. Well, I was thinking that you and I, we could have... Thank you. It's very thoughtful. A drink. Well, that didn't work. You had to get into trouble while I was talking to the new neighbor, huh? Listen, Zoe. You got to keep it together, okay? 'Cause that one, she likes to dot her I's and cross her T's. Parrot: Rise and shine. Ugh. Seriously? Early bird gets the worm. I'm trying. Martha? Martha? Martha. Hey. Martha. Is that your owner's name? Martha? Now you stop talking. Come on. Follow me. Yeah. Follow me. Yeah! Come on. Fly. Fly outside. Fly. Fly outside! Fly. Fly, bird. Fly, fly! Come on. Fly. Woo-hoo! Fly outside. Come on. Fly, fly. Don't you want to fly? Come on. Don't you want to go home? Maybe you can't go home. Oh. Hello? Where are you? Uh, I am on my way. Good, 'cause the Tenolin clients aren't happy. So, I need you to go over some new art, and the Hennessy proposals need to be proofed before noon. Yeah. Of course. I will be there soon. Bye, Kyle. You be good. Sorry about last night. No big deal. How's your picture? My picture? The one that fell? Right, yeah. It's, uh, good. It's broken. Definitely broken. Mm-hmm? After you. - Floor? - Lobby, please. Ah. - You off to work? - Mm-hmm. Yep. You? Yeah. Putting in my eight hours directing air traffic. You have a bird dropping on your shoulder. What? 'Morning. Both: 'Morning. Oh, Ted, I heard from maintenance you're having some issues with your thermostat. Ted: Oh, actually, it's fine now. I'll come by tomorrow just to make sure. And I'll see you both later at the condo meeting? - Yeah, of course. - Yes. Okay, good. Ah. I'll see you, Ted. Don't work too hard. Hi. Hi there. I don't know if your veterinarians treat birds, but I have a parrot that may or may not be able to fly. No. I really don't know much about the parrot. Parrot? Do we need one for casting? Um, I'm going to call you back. Okay. Bye. Uh, um, a bird flew into my new place. You got a place? Yeah. I did. Well, that's great. I'll come by and see it. Bring you a plant or something. Uh, yeah, sure. That's okay. Yeah. Hey. By the way, do we have the flight simulator booked for the spot? Yes, and here are the headshots that came in for the pilot role. I think that guy might be a good choice. Hmm. Nope, nope, nope. Nope. No. None of these are special enough. I want, like, a Buzz Lightyear, but not anime. Yeah. On it. Gineen: Next on the agenda, door decorations. Some of you have expressed your desire to display wreaths and whatnot. I think as long as it's inoffensive, we can bring the matter to a vote. All those who agree to door decorations, raise your hands. Oh, wow. Um... Great. Now, regarding the new no-pet policy, I'm thrilled at how accommodating everyone has been. Especially because I would hate to have to give anyone notice for not complying. And we all know how difficult it is to secure a unit in the city. Just ask our newest tenant, Angie, who was lucky enough to win one of our rental units by lottery. Angie: Oh, wow. Thank you. Gineen: All right, then. Up next, we have here... What about a size restriction to the rule? Say if it was no pets bigger than 50 or 60 pounds. Gineen: I'd love to oblige, Ted. But my father, who owns the building, has instructed me to maintain the property, and all we know pets spell property damage. Okay. And this concludes our meeting. Ah. - How are you settling in? - Oh, I'm great. Good. I love it here. Ah. Well, I hope it works out, because, you see, my father, he worked very hard to find good tenants who respect the rules. And I want to do my best to follow in his footsteps. I totally get that. No. And I'm all about the rules. I love rules, rules, rules, and especially the part about the no-pet thing. Ugh. Who has got time for a pet? Not me. No. Gineen: I'm glad to hear that. Uh, crackers? Of course. Yeah. I'd love one, thank you. Enjoy. You don't really think this no-pet rule is reasonable, do you? Yes. Of course. Personally, I think it's a bit archaic. I mean, most places are starting to adopt at least size restrictions. Hmm. Well, I guess I could see that. But why rock the boat when you don't have to, right? Right. See you around. Angie: Okay. I only have, like, 15 minutes. Oh, it's okay. Don't worry about it. I have to run back to the apartment and clean it, because it is a disaster. I did not realize how much of my slack you were picking up. Hmm, it really wasn't that bad. - It was all the time. - All the time. - Literally all the time. - It was all the time. Ah, so tell me about the new place. How's the new apartment? How's the neighbor? Any interaction there? Well, I found out he's an air traffic controller. Ooh! But if I'm going to be doing any flirting, it's definitely going to be Gineen. The condo cop? Yeah. I really want to be on her good side, because I think she might have a thing for him, Which is totally fine by me, because I don't think Ted wants to be all that neighborly with me anyway. Plus, I think Kyle might stop by for a little housewarming. So, we just file away the hot pilot in the fantasy bank for now. Wait. Done and done. Ooh. Thank you. - Oh, I got to go. - Oh. - Sorry. - Okay. - I love you. - I love you, too. - Thank you for my coffee. - Of course. Bye. Hey. Stop it. Stop it. Angie: Oop. Hello, Angie. Oh, hello, Gineen. - Hmm. - Ted is not home. Shh, shh, shh. He's working a double. Really? I didn't think air traffic controllers were allowed to work double shifts. Did I say he is working? I meant he is playing... doubles tennis. Oh, you know, well then maybe I should get the master key - and feed his fish... - I'm gonna feed his fish! He asked me to do it. I'm gonna go out, get some fish food, bring it back, feed his fish. He is very busy. Sounds like you two have become quite... friendly. Mmm. No, no, no. Just good neighbors doing what neighbors do. Alright. I guess I'll just swing by later. Bye. Yours? Yeah. No, uh, sort of. I'm dog sitting. Don't worry. Your secret is safe with me. I appreciate it. Just don't tell Gineen, if you get caught then I'd be in cahoots. I promise I will not bring you down with me. Mmm. Thanks, Ted. Aw, thank you, for being a good sport. Yeah. Anytime. Hello! Hello! Hello! So, my sister adopted Zoe and then two weeks later she got a promotion overseas. The plan was to keep her in boarding until she got settled, but as the emergency contact and the boarders contacted me when she wasn't adjusting so... here we are. So, how long have you been keeping her a secret? - Two couple of weeks. - Ugh. How about you? Chatty Kathy over there conveniently crashed into my place the day I moved in. Wow, and it just stayed? Yeah, and just stayed. I'm actually starting to wonder if maybe there's something wrong with it? I mean he can only fly from like, here to the couch and that's about it. Well, I can sympathize with that. What do you mean? I um, I tried to get my wings. But turns out getting your pilot's license is a lot harder than I thought. Proved my dad right. Better just to keep my feet firmly planted on the ground. Hmm. Well, my mom was a dancer, and she never kept her feet on the ground, she was a firm believer in always reaching for the sky. But that's kind of like an air traffic controller, right? You're like the Godfather of the skies. Always telling the planes where to go, like, "You, get outta the airspace." Yeah, yeah, kind of exactly like that. You know I was wrong about you. I thought you were all about dotting your I's and crossing you t's. Well I guess... I'm a woman of mystery then. I'm sorry, my phone must be connected to my Bluetooth. - No. - Disconnected. Sorry about that. Do you wanna go look at the sunset? It's so beautiful. Yes, I do. Ted: So, what kind of job do you have? Advertising, but it's temporary, because my dream is to one day write scripts, for movies. I just haven't had a lot of time to do it, because of all the fires. Well, what kind of scripts would you write, if you did have the time. Adventure. Like Romancing the Stone or Raiders of the Lost Ark. I just love the exotic thrill of it. Problem is, my lack of adventure is making it kinda hard for me to be inspired. I mean, the most excitement I've had is that darn bird. Not that I want any more excitement with that thing. Well, the good news is, Gineen doesn't actually live in the building. But she does manage to be here most days, so if things get a bit exciting I promise, I got your back. Thanks, Ted. Cheers to that. Cheers... to our joint adventure. The air is hot. The sky threatens. No. Delete. Ugh... The air is thick with the threat of a storm. Not the only danger that lurks in the jungle. What danger? Nice night, right? Why don't we go take a look? There you go. Look. Nice night, right? Lots of stars. Although... I bet where your ancestors came from there's a lot more stars. Where do you think they came from? Costa Rica? Panama? Huh, Panama. I like that. I bet you could write my jungle adventure. Angie and Gil. Yeah! That's my name. Angie. And is your name Gil? Huh. Well, it's very nice to meet you, Gil. Hmm. Maybe that's a story. A girl and her bird. Angie! - Ted, hey. - Hey! Guess what? I found out the parrot's name is Gil. Sounds like more of a fish name but maybe it will help me find its owner. Ah! Well if you want, I have an appointment booked with Zoe's vet this morning and she agreed to take a look at Gil's wing. Really? Thanks, Ted. That's nice of you. Yeah, but if you have to work, I can take him. No, no, no, this is more important. Let me just tell my office I have a doctor's appointment. You need me to write you a doctor's note? That's okay, but thank you. Come on, let's go get the kids. You want adventure? Getting your pets out of here without getting busted is about as adventurous as it gets. Okay! Clear. Hmm. Gineen: Was that Ted and Angie? I believe so. Heh. Two of them seem to be getting on. Well of course. They're neighbors. Not like Ted and I... we have a different kind of connection. I'm sure you've seen it. Being the eyes and ears. Alright, then. As you were. So, no idea where he came from? None. Vet: Well I can fix his wing. Is it broken? Fractured. Which can heal, it'll just take a couple of weeks. But he'll be able to fly again? A hundred percent. As long as we restrict his movement. If you want, we could board him here until it heals. Um... Yeah. That would be a huge help. Thanks. I'll just have the technician prepare a room. Hey, don't worry. He'll be well taken care of. Thanks. Plus, it will give me time to find his owner. Oh, Zoe, he's gonna be okay. Okay. Great. - Hey. - Yeah? We did it. The Tenolin client loved the spot. - I told you. Dynamite. - Ah, Kyle, that's so great! We should celebrate. Um... I... I have to take this. Hi, Angie speaking. Hi. It's Doctor Moore. Oh, hi, yeah. Is... Is everything okay? Your parrot is fine apart from displaying some signs of depression. He won't eat, he's self-comforting... in the state he's in, I worry his health will decline, so I think it's best if you take him home. Yeah, of course. I'll be right there. Vet: Great. See you soon. I'm really sorry, Kyle, I have to go, it's my bird. Bird? Parrot, the one I told you about. I... I have to bring it home from the vet. Then we'll celebrate at your place. - I'll bring the bubbles. - Yeah. Okay. See you later. See ya. There you are, Gil. Home, sweet home. Are you gonna sing for me? Can you say Ted? Ted. Ted and Angie. Hmm. I can sing you a song. Ted and Angie Sittin' in a tree K-I-S-S-I-N-G Flying so high in the sky With her birdie by her side We'll keep going. Ted. Hey, what's going on? Um... Gineen is coming over, so I was wondering, would you mind? Oh. Yeah. Of course. Um, actually... What's going on here? Uh, Kyle! How did you get in here? I snuck in with some old timer. Oh... Okay. Kyle! This is my neighbor Ted, and his sister's dog, and Ted, this is Kyle. Nice to meet you. Likewise. I'll pop the bubbly. Okay. I should go clear any evidence, but thank you for this. You are a life saver. You say it just flew in here, huh? Angie: Uh, yeah. Well I'd just leave it at the shelter. No, shelters, they don't take parrots. They'd have to, if you dumped it at their doorstep. Nasty bugger. He's actually really sweet. You know this is a pretty great unit. In fact, I was looking for a second place, closer to work. Might be a win, win. What the... Sorry. Kyle: It's like a zoo in here! Angie: I know. We'll go outside. Zoe, down. You be good. Let's go outside. Well cheers. This is long overdue. Angie: Cheers. Kyle: Great place you got here. Yeah, sure is. - Cheers again. - Yeah. I really do appreciate the follow up. Well, I know you said the thermostat was working, but I thought it best I check in and make sure. Oh, what do you know? There goes now. There's the AC, so clearly... all good. Gineen: Hm... Wow, you have quite the aquatics going on. Yes, nothing but fish... in here. And a cat. Sorry? Catfish. You know, it's such a nice night, we should grab a drink on the balcony. Ooh, excellent. Angie: Zoe, quiet. All good in there? Oh, yeah! Everything's great. I can manage! Like I manage everything. Zoe, shh. You be quiet too! Here. Come hang out. Get some air. - Sorry about that. - Yeah, no worries. Oh, thanks. Kyle: Work's going well. I've got a big meeting tomorrow. It's exciting. Oh, looks like your neighbor has a male visitor. We just met. You know, Ted, I was actually not on board with my dad's decision to run the rental lottery. To me, it just skirts the whole screening process. Well, you do not have to worry about Angie. She likes to dot her I's and cross her t's. Well, there is one tenant who would pass a screening with flying colors. You talking about Jay? Because... I would keep an eye on him. Have you seen the size of that wreath on his door? It's huge. Could hide a squirrel in there. Seriously, I'm not joking. - Why don't we go inside? - But we just came out. You okay? You seem, distracted. Angie: Yeah. Just... I'm really in my head right now, just... thinking about my script. You're still doing that, huh? Yeah. Why wouldn't I? Just because you're so good at what you're doing now. Well maybe I can be good at both. Kyle, the other night I was so inspired when I started writing. In fact, I think I might do some more writing tonight. Maybe I can send you what I've got after I'm done. Sure. Send it my way. I'll look at it when I get back from Cleveland. Which reminds me, can you cover me when I'm away? Yeah. Of course. Kyle: See? I don't even know why I ask. We're like yin and yang, Ange. You cover me, and together we balance one another out. Rock steady. Uh, look I do want to get to my writing and I have to hold down the fort, so I think we should call it a night. Alright. But next time, I bring dinner. Seriously? Good luck in Cleveland. Kyle: Yeah, thanks. Our heroine cups her hand to her mouth and calls out like a bird. Within seconds a streak of colored feathers swirl above as her trusty bird lands on her shoulder. Then... the sound of twigs snapping and out from the forest bursts a dog. Followed by a ruggedly handsome explorer, clutching the very treasure map our heroine had been seeking. Oh. - Angie: Hey, Ted. - Hey. - All good? - Yeah. Zoe started barking, but Gil amazingly calmed her down. - Gil? - Yeah. The vet called, said that he was depressed so of course, I brought him home. I'm sorry, I wouldn't have dumped Zoe on you, if I knew and... looked like you guys were trying to have a nice night. No, no, no. He was just dropping off a plan, and wanted to talk work, and blah-blah-blah. I'm happy that Gineen didn't bust you. Yeah, but you know what, she's... She's alright. She's just trying to impress her dad by doing a good job. Right. Ruthie! Oh, Ruthie. Bingo. I don't know what that means. Maybe whoever owns him plays bingo. You know, actually, I have an old family friend that runs a bingo game not that far from here If you want, we could go check it out. Might be worth a shot? - Yeah, okay. - I owe you one. - Goodnight, Angie. - Night, Ted. Night, Zoe. Angie: I just don't get their dynamic. Is he into her? Is he not? Are they an item? I don't know. Well, I mean, do you care, though? I thought you were with Kyle. Mmm... I just don't think that Kyle, he gets me. Well, I can sympathize with that. Oh no. What's going on? Aaron got offered this new position with less travel. And he's excited about it, but I kind of like things the way they were. I mean, he would fly in, we'd spend some whirlwind days together, and then he would fly out... and I don't know, it just... Oh! On that note, I should fly myself. Beth, I really want to talk about this, though. - I know. We will. Later. - Okay, okay. - Hey, uh, Ted. - Hey! This is my copilot and my bestie, Beth. Beth: Hi. Have fun at bingo. And don't worry, your secret is safe with me. - Bye. - Bye, Beth. - Uh, I tell her everything. - Everyone needs one of those. You ready? 'Cause I've gotta pick up Zoe from the groomers in three hours. - She loves it there. - Mmm. My kinda girl. B5. B5. Wow, this bingo is some serious business. Man: Bingo! We have a bingo. Come on up and get your prize. We'll take a short break. - Theodore. - Martin, my man. How are you? Still kicking and she's still ticking. Ted: Great. Martin this is my neighbor Angie. Hi, it's so nice to meet you, Martin. Pleasure to meet you. So, what brings you by other than a friendly howdy do? Well, Martin, a parrot flew into my condo, and we think the owner might hang out here because it keeps on yelling bingo. And the name Ruth. Ah, I'd love to help you, but the closest thing we have to Ruth is Roy over there, and he's got a ferret. But if you'd like to ask around... maybe play a round. Yeah. Thanks, Martin. We will. Alright. I'll see you before you go? You bet. - Bye, Martin. - Nice to meet you. Okay! You take that side? - Meet you in the middle? - Great. Hi there, do you happen to know a woman named Ruth? Do you know a Ruth? She has a parrot. Do you anyone named Ruth? A parrot... Ugh. Any luck? Nope. No one's heard of a Ruth or anyone with a parrot. But... I did score us a couple of these. Ready to try your luck? I was born ready. O66. O66. B12, B12... I28... N42... G50. - Yes. Yes. I got a bingo! - Bingo! I got a bingo! I got a bingo! I got a bingo! - Hey, that's the prize! - Oh, thank you, Martin. Very impressive. Very impressive. Angi. - Oh, thank you. - Oh, thank you. Mm. Oh! Don't you find when you win things taste so much better? I don't know. Let me see... Mmm. - Yes, definitely. - Theodore! Is this gonna be a thing... Angela? Wait. How did you know that was my name? Ted: Lucky guess. This is such a beautiful spot. It's nice, right? All the major flight paths go right overhead. Oh, do not tell Zoe we were here, though. It's her favorite spot to come play catch. I would never. I'll even clean my shoes off, to get rid of the scent. Wow. You are stealth. Mmm. I'm trying. I'm learning. So, how long have you been working in air traffic control? Uh... I've been at it for a while. Long enough that I train the new recruits. Do you have your pilot's license? No. I took the test six months ago, but... didn't make it. Well, you know, what they always say, at first if you don't succeed... Ted: Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you know, dreams are a tricky thing. My dad, he's an amazing musician. You know, he played in bars. And even drove down to Nashville. But in the end, the grind just wore him down, so he got a good job and... seemed happy enough. Well my mom used to always say, to never give up on your dreams. I guess that's easy for her to say, because she got to live out hers on the stage. I always loved to dance too. But my passion has always been my writing, Which is why I keep on doing it. I just never thought that I'd be doing the job of five different people all at once though. Well, maybe there's a way you could find a little balance. Outside of work. Because you know what they say, all work and no play... I know. Are calling me dull, Theodore? Absolutely not. - Such a nice guy. - He's nice. I mean, he said that I should come back and play. Ted: Yeah, I bet he did. Hey, kids, where you been at? - We were playing bingo. - And winning. Got the lucky horseshoe do ya? Uh, she does. Me, not so much. Ooh, I should go and get... my, uh, fish food and get it back here before I have to head into work. Well if you want, I could take your... fish food and feed your fish for you. You sure? You've got a lot on your plate. Oh no, I can handle it. Plus, my fish could really use some company. Okay. Well I should give you an extra set of my keys, then. - Mmm-hmm. - You know, just in case of emergencies? Alright. I shouldn't be too late. Oh, whenever is totally fine. I'll just make sure that the fish food is back at your place before you get back. - Perfect. - Bye. Bye. You know there's this author, Gladys Taber. My grandmother used to love her books. She had this saying about neighbors. Oh yeah? What was that? Being a good neighbor is an art which makes life richer. Huh. I like that. I'll see you later, Louis. Alright, Zoe. Come on. Let's get you home. Gil tired you out, huh? Don't worry. Your uncle will be home soon. Gil: Cha-cha-cha. Hmm. That's pretty good. Cha-cha-cha. Cha-cha-cha. I am tired. Angie, it's Gineen, I know you're home. Uh... Coming! Gineen, hi, So sorry about that. I burnt something on the stove. What are you doing here this late? I normally check in in the evenings, just to see what goes on. And well, in fact I saw you lock up Ted's apartment so I wanted to make sure everything is okay. No, it's great. I was feeding his fish again. Gil: Not on your Nelly! That was my brother. He's on a work call, he gets very worked up. Well if your brother's been staying with you, all guests need to be registered at the front desk. Oh no, of course. I've done that. Good. Because I wouldn't want to find a reason why this wouldn't work out. Me too. Great. Well, I will be seeing you... Angie. Hey, Kyle. I sent you my script last night. - Did you read it? - Hm? No, no not yet. Alright, flight attendants, airliner 242, prepare for takeoff. No, no cut! He's a fence post. Get him outta here! Every... Everything is all here. Kyle, this is the guy that you chose. Who knows what he's doing in the cockpit. If I were on this guy's plane, I'd be pulling the chute. This is a disaster. It's going to cost the client a whole day. Okay, uh... Hold that thought. Give me one second. Ted, hi, it's Angie. Um... You wouldn't happen to be free today, are you? My phone like a bone. don't Well, I couldn't have told him to leave his dog at home when he's doing me a favor. - Hey. - How do I look? You look... perfect. Um, Ted, come here. - Okay. - Yeah. So, this is the line, right here. Before that, just say whatever comes out naturally when you're about to... takeoff and fly. - Okay. - Okay. Whoo! Places everyone! - Thanks. - Good luck. Ted: 'Kay. You must be pretty good neighbors for him to do this. Angie: Yeah. We help each other out. Assistant Director: Okay, quiet down. Camera assistant: Alpha only, mark. And... action. Briefing confirmed. Flight instruments checked. Flight attendants, prepare for takeoff. Flight 242 is clear for takeoff. I don't need autopilot. And... Cut! - That was amazing. - It was alright? Yeah, you're so good. You're like... you're a natural. I'd have to agree. Angie, make sure your neighbor here gets an upgrade on the day. Yeah. Of course I will. Yeah. Hey, Zoe! Hey, come on. Sorry about that. No. No biggie. Well, we should get back to work. Yeah. Thanks again. You were a real life saver. I'm glad I could help. Plus I owe you one, or a couple. Angie? Um, yeah. I gotta get back to work, but I'll see you back at the ol' homestead. See you there. Come on. Angie: I'm so happy you loved it... Can you send the dailies off to the new client? Thanks. I appreciate that. Yeah, I'm learning Rumba, Tango, and Cha Cha. Of course. Cha, cha, cha. Hi, it's Angie. I was wondering if you could help me locate a possible dance student? Yes, her name would be Ruth... Hey, Louis. You hungry? Cause I got enough here to feed a family. I just finished a club sandwich, couldn't eat another bite. Hey, that was a long day. Ugh! Longer. So, I figured out cha, cha, cha is a dance, the one that Gil keeps... my friend keeps on saying. Right. And? No luck. I called all the dance studios. None of them have cha cha cha in them. Well, if you want we could dig into it a bit further with a little takeout. Yeah. I'd like that. It's amazing how hard you're trying to find Gil's owner. You know, with everything you juggle at work. Well, apparently I'm a pro at multi-tasking. In fact, I think I have almost finished my script. Congratulations. Thank you. Do you think I could... read it? Only if you feel comfortable sharing... No, I would love for you to read it. Just... I don't have an ending yet. Well, that's perfect. I love a cliff hanger. Oh. Oh... Oh no. It's someone responding to my online ad for Gil. They said they'll take him. Is that a good thing? I don't know... I really do want to find his owner. He's just been through so much. He was injured, and now he ends up with me... And then I just ship him off to a stranger? I can't do that to him. What? It's just nice, you're willing to take the risk. Well, he's a really sweet bird. Even though he is a loud mouth. Gil: Bingo! Do you want to maybe have a drink inside? Yeah. Yeah, I'd love that. You got music? Oh. Do I have music? - Yeah, yeah. I like this song. - Alright. - Oh, okay, good song. - I like this. Ooh, Gil's got the moves. Okay, Gil. Ted: Gil, come on, man. You're upstaging me. Zoe? You know what? Forget it. Fine. Let's see what you got. Wow. That was... incredible. Zoe and I, we are truly humbled. I told you, my mom was a dancer. Still, if I tried any of that I'd just end up tripping over my own feet. Well, it's actually not that hard. It's really just all about the music, and... how it makes you feel. Ted: Oh. You got me good And it's all about... your breath. Did the music just change? Yeah. Oh. Sorry. Take me on a ride I've never been before... Sorry about that. No, I should, uh, get Zoe home. She's like a toddler if she gets overtired. Yeah, well, thanks so much for sharing your take-out with me. I had fun. It's what neighbors do. Slide that script under my door. Come on. Night, Angie. Night, Ted. Uh, Seth, have the Delish promos been photoshopped yet? Seth: Kyle put me on another client, because he said you'd do it. There you are. - What are you doing? - Oh, uh... What is it that you want, Kyle? Dinner. You and I. This Saturday? We can go over a few things, work and... you know, other stuff. Like my script? - Right. - Did you read it? Yeah, yeah I did. - And? - Honestly, Ange, I think this job is a better fit for you. So why keep struggling with the writing when you fall into all this so easily here with me. You just got to get that beautiful head of yours out of the clouds and then you'll see how you and I can make this place the best it can be. How about we talk about this more over dinner this weekend? Yeah... Yeah, that sounds good. Kyle: We'll go over the Garrison proposal. It'll be great. Great. What if Kyle's right? Angie. Hey. Hey. Is that your masterpiece? Oh, I really wouldn't call it that... I don't want to set the bar too high. Here. I'll read t tomorrow before I go check out some wings. Wings? What do you mean? Why don't you come with me, I'll show you. You know what? Maybe I will. - Of course. - Thank you. Uh, Ted. Remember. Low expectations. Ted: Looks good. Angie narrating: In a cloud of dust, the plane lands and careens down the hilltop coming to a stop just inches from where the hill gives way to a deep cavern. Our heroine steps out of the plane, amazed once again by the pilot's abilities to navigate the wild terrain before they begin their descent towards the treasure they've been seeking. Ted: Welcome to my fantasy. Angie: Wow. This is like a giant plane museum. Ted: Yeah, except, these planes they aren't retired. - So, they actually fly? - Yeah. They sure do. That one over there, that's called a Mustang. And this big fella' here, that's a 1953 Beaver. - Incredible bush plane. - Is that a Spitfire? Ted: Yeah! That's a Spitfire. Wow, you know your planes. I know a little bit. You know from school. Ted: I am impressed. This one over here, my favorite. This plane is just... oh, it's incredible. I'd love to fly this someday. Just take it up higher and higher until your head was literally in the clouds. Sounds like it would really take your breath away. It would, yeah. You know something else took my breath away... Your script. Thanks, Ted, but you really don't need to say that. No, no! I mean it! Your words they're... they're incredible, they transported me. You know, just like flying. Well, I guess both our heads should be in the clouds, then. Because this place, with all these planes I can tell, that's where your heart and passion is. I hope your feet are never on the ground. I wish there was a place that we could all spread our wings and fly, right, Zoe? Thanks, for reading my script. And all of this. Thank you for sharing it. That was so fun! I cannot wait to tell Beth all about the planes. Well, maybe you should bring her next time. Yeah. She'd love that. Uh-oh, uh-oh. Angie. Just the tenant I wanted to see. And Ted. What have you both been up to? And whose dog is in your car? That's uh, my sister's. Yeah. - My sister's... dog. - Huh. Lives at my sister's house, and she needed me to take the dog out for a walk 'cause she was stuck at work, and then we ran into Angie on our walk... with my car. Oh, well, if your sister is so busy, maybe she shouldn't have a dog. What is that? Ah this is a decoy for your balcony. It's supposed to scare off birds. Right... Yeah. Great. Thank you so much! - We should go set up. - Oh... You don't have to bother. I'm sure it's not that tricky. Plus, I'll just ask maintenance, if I have a problem. Sure. But make sure it's clearly visible on the railing. - I should probably get going... - Well, I should get my... Sister's dog back to my sister. She's done work, so... Time to get out of here. Let's go! Whoa! Bye. Hmm. Gil, you will never believe the wings that I saw today. You'd be so impressed. Although, I'm sure when your wing heals, you'll be able to fly as high as you ever did before. Promise you. Now... there's no way an owl would scare a parrot. Would it? Gil? Gil, you okay? What's wrong? Hi there. Uh, you seem to know a bit about birds, right? I did take an ornithology class. I'm going to assume that has to do with birds. So, I have a parrot, and he's usually very friendly, but he became very uncomfortable when he saw... this. The parrot the only pet you got? Yep, until another bird flies into my condo. Well in the wild parrots thrive when they find a partner. And if you're all he's got, this could be making him jealous. Oh... So, Gil, he's feeling lonely because... I'm all he has. I agree. Well, thank you. I guess. No problem. Anytime. Yeah. Gil: Not on your Nelly! - Hey, neighbor. - Hey. You just getting back now? Yeah, Gineen was overseeing some yard work so it took me until now to sneak Zoe back in. How is... the owl? Apparently, Gil is lonely, so he saw the owl as a threat to my affections. Really? Yeah, really. Well, I can't deny Gil has good taste. Thanks. Anyway, um, I want to try and find Gil's sanctuary. The one here is overcrowded. So, I'm looking at different states. My hope is to find Gil the partner that he needs. Sounds like a good plan. Well, I should get back inside, but thank you so much for today. I had so much fun. Hey, you don't have to thank me. Goodnight. 'Night. And good luck with the sanctuary. Thanks, Ted. That parking spot doesn't come with your condo. Sorry, Jay, I can't do it. Not on your Nelly! Have a good one. Louis, did you just say, "Not on your Nelly?" That's right. I had forgotten about it, but my grandma used to say, especially when we try to put her in a home. She had a lot to say then. I don't know why she put up such a fight. There was a beauty parlor, dingo night, dance class. That's it! Thank you, Louis, and thank you, Grandma. Kyle: Angie, where are you? Kyle, I'll be just about an hour. Because we're swamped over here. Look, I'll get there as soon as I can. Bye. Angie! Woman: Not on your Nelly! Martha, I won fair and square. So, sorry to bother you, but you wouldn't happen to be Ruth by any chance. Well, I should hope not, or I'd be six feet under. What do you mean? Ruthie passed away a few weeks ago. I'm so sorry. Have a seat, dear. I'm sorry, too. Ruthie was a sweetheart. Even though some people around here thought different, because she spoke her mind, just like that bird of hers. Gil, the parrot. I have him. I have Gil. He flew into my condo. Well, what do you know? I was worried about that loudmouth after he got loose. Ruthie would be glad to know he's found a new home. Besides speaking her mind... what was Ruth like? I mean, how did she end up with a parrot? She was chasing a dream. Ruthie always wanted to travel the islands of the South Pacific, wanted to see the birds of paradise with her own eyes, but, like it always does, life got busy, she kept putting it off and putting it off. Ended up here, and wondering how it became too late. So, she got Gil to remind her of her dreams. That's right. So she could wake up every morning and see that bird and imagine, just for a moment, she's in paradise. Oh, well, that's lunch. Do me a favor. Tell that dang bird of yours Nancy says hello. I will, Nancy. Thank you. Kyle: I don't care if it's not their job, find someone to do it. Oh, thank goodness. Why didn't you respond to my text last night? It was late, Kyle. Well, the wrong stills from the shoot went out for the client, so I need you to do damage control. I know you're not the point person, but you're so good at it. Yeah, I'll handle that, but after that, I think I'm going to take some time off. Time off? For what? I want to finish my script. Oh, Angie. What? I told you this is your thing. I don't think that it is, and I want at least try before it's too late. Did you even read my script? I skimmed it. So you didn't even read it. It's not even finished, Ang. There's no ending. So, how could I really dig in? It's not finished because I keep on being sidelined with all of this. That's because this is what you should be doing. No. No. Not on your Nelly. Who's Nelly? I'm not gonna do this anymore. None of it. So the only hat that I'm gonna be wearing from now on is my writer's cat. Angie. Come on. You're making a big mistake. What you're talking about is a pipe dream. This! This is real, Angie! Don't look at me. Gotta Rumba. I feel totally free, Beth. Like I literally could do anything. And you can. You know what? You are so right. Gineen can't kick me out for going after Ted. So, I'm taking him out of the fantasy bank and I am going to go for it. That a girl. Yay! Hello, Louis. Give me props. Hey, it's Ted. I'd like to book a time. Guess what, Gil? I'm free. I think this calls for a little celebration, don't you think? Maybe a cha-cha-cha? Okay! Gil? Gil?! Uh, Gil? Cha-cha-cha! Gil! Gil! No, no, no, no, no! Gil? Gil. Gil! It's okay, Gil. It's okay. He just flew in and landed here. Thanks, Louis. Sorry. I guess I didn't close his cage properly. That's beside the point, don't you think? No, of course. Gineen, for what it's worth, I didn't mean to have a pet. He just flew in here one day and... Just start packing. Hm. Gil: Condo cop! Hey! Ted. There you are. Oh, out with your sister's dog again, I see. Yes. On that note, I have bad news. It turns out I was right to have concerns about your new neighbor. What do you mean? It means she was hiding a pet. This giant parrot that was flying around wreaking havoc. Huh! Wow. Wow. Wow. I know, it's a disappointment, especially since it means I'll have to evict her. So, it's a good thing that dog is your sister's. Otherwise, I'd say you and your neighbor were in cahoots. Actually, Zoe has been staying here with me, and it's just temporary, and I really don't want to lose this place, but Angie and I... Then, you won't. I don't understand. It's temporary and it's not as if it's your pet. So, it's not like Angie's situation at all. Well, no, but neither is Gil... Then you're not at fault. See you at the next meeting, and maybe we'll have a drink after. I thought we were in this together. I guess I was wrong. Hey, hey. Be good! Angie? - Gineen. - Yes? You know, I don't think we'll be having that drink after all. Angie and I, we were in cahoots. Okay. Here we go. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Well, I did find Gil's sanctuary. I have to fly out there with him, but it's going to be totally worth it. Why don't you talk to him? What's the point? He's not my neighbor anymore. I don't need him to cover for me and he clearly never needed me to. Okay, well the point is that you were going to go for it. I just thought that he would fight a bit harder for me and for Gil. Sorry, buddy. No response. Maybe I was wrong. Maybe we were just neighbors. Hey, sis. How's the Netherlands? That's great. I guess you'll be wanting Zoe back. Yeah, sure. No problem. Yeah, call me back. Oh, Gil. You're so depressed. You don't even care about your nemesis. Gil: Gil and Zoe. I know. I miss her, too. Gil: Gil and Zoe. Wait. It wasn't the stupid owl. You were protecting Zoe's toys. Looks like we both have a little bit of a heartache. Alright, let's give this another shot. I'll make sure your mail gets forwarded. Thanks, Louis. It's not a problem. I'm doing the same thing for Ted. Ted? Wait, what do you mean? He's moving out, too. I thought you knew. No, I thought that Gineen was okay with Zoe. She was, but then Ted told her it wasn't right. He said the two of you were in it together, and he wasn't going to let you take the only fall because he knows a good neighbor is an art that makes life richer, and I think you're both pretty rich. Thanks, Louis. You're the best. See you around. Get it! Go! Come on. Hey, neighbor. What are you doing here? A little bird told me where to find you. I'm sorry, Ted, that I didn't respond to any of your texts. No, that's all right. I totally get it. Look, I heard you talking to Janine. The part where she told you that you could stay and I couldn't, and I thought that you didn't have my back. Turn out. I was wrong. So, thank you. For becoming homeless? Yeah, I guess. Well, to be honest, I didn't want to live there anyway. Not without you. Because... I think you're right. I think we do belong in the clouds. I think we belong there together. I think you're right. Oop! Oh, Zoe. I missed you, too. Well, you won't have to miss her. My sister called. She couldn't find a place that takes dogs. So, I'm keeping her. So, I guess Gil doesn't need to find a partner after all. He's got one right here. Sure does. Well, I guess I should go unpack. Not necessarily. So any idea where you want to fly to? I don't know. Maybe someplace tropical. Inspiration for my next script. Does that mean you found the ending for your first one? I sure have. I was looking for a crash pad closer to work. As long as there aren't any pets allowed. Absolutely not. Oh. Oh, and birds on the balcony? Such a nuisance. And is there anything worse than the sound of a neighbor's dog barking? Nothing. Well, shall we go over a lease, and maybe get a coffee? I'd love to. Okay. This way. Goodnight. Kyle & Gineen: Goodnight. All clear. Hello there, Gidget. Did someone get a haircut? Looking good, looking good. Hey, Eddie. Did you get a new collar? I think you did. Brandy, my girl, where have you been all my life? Time to get you two home. Yeah. Angie: Exterior, jungle day. A parrot soars high above the tree lines, skimming the treetops, while down below, our heroine, her pilot, and her trusty dog leave the spoils of the discovered treasure behind as they head back into the jungle, ready to take on their next adventure.
