Dear sports lovers... Presenting the final contest of the 5th All Kerala Tug of War competition... ...organised by Dynamo Arts and Sports club. From Kasargode, the land with the fusion of 7 languages including Kairali and Kannada... to the martial grounds of Ananthapuri where Anantha Padmanabhan is enshrined... gripping hard to the rope that's twisted with lengths of coir forming a golden rope... charging over the robust opponent, defeating him to the depths of failure... and adorning the crown of success. That's what this zestful battle is all about. Come on sports lovers, give them a round of applause. (Crowd cheering) At the battlefield of Dynamo Arts and Sports club... on one side is Christone, Rajakkad, Idukki... and the other side is Udaya, Pallipadi. With the onset of the red hued dusk, the setting sun... ...has turned the western horizon blood red. The shrouds of darkness envelopes this evening. Come on man, pull!! Come on pull! Hey Sara!! Here Christone Rajakkad, Idukki wins! After witnessing 24 champion teams battling here at The Dynamos Arts and Sports Club... I told you Sara to place someone with a strong footing at the back... Don't blame me now. If you guys in the front had a strong footing, we wouldn't fall like this... Enough, there's no point in arguing. Let's go. We should have had a dip in that pond and come back. For what? Is it to gather the townsfolk in this midnight? Ahh?! Get down fast. Sarah, stop fooling around and give me the key. They must have started partying. Even if we win or lose, once you get totally sloshed... ...by the next day morning everything will be fine. I should've been born as a boy. So what? You are already a boy. This is the only difference you have... And you always have to remind me of that. - Give me the key. - Hmm. - Goodnight! - Goodnight. My Jesus...that devil is staring. Sara! Sara... Don't scream. I'm not deaf. Who do you think you are? You don't deserve an answer for that. Whatever I say, she's prompt to reply in English. Mom, she is a spoilt brat. How will I get her married to a respectable home? Don't worry about that. I think she will find someone and get married herself. I should be blamed for this. I made all the offerings to have a baby boy. I am tired of hearing the remarks of the townsfolk. You should leave that child to her ways. Don't simply torture her. I told you Sara to place someone with a strong footing at the back... I should've been born as a boy. So what? You are already a boy. This is the only difference you have... "Lass, oh Lass!!" "You're smarter than the height of the skies" "The entire city is crossing with you" "Lass, oh Lass!!" "Your black eyes are shimmering..." "...shaking those lovely earrings" "She looks like..." "...a girl" "But she desires deep down..." "...to be considered as a boy" "If you go..." "...to befriend her" "She turns to be your closest buddy with zeal in her eyes" "Are you changing with the tide of time..." "...and with new fads, my dear girl?" "Lass, oh Lass!!" "You're smarter than the height of the skies" "The entire city is cross with you" "Lass, oh Lass!!" "Your black eyes are shimmering..."

"You're smarter than the height of the skies" "The entire city is cross with you" "Lass, oh Lass!!" "Your black eyes are shimmering..." "...shaking those lovely earrings" Hello? - Sara Thomas? - Yes. Is this with the permission of your parents? Mama! What's the matter? I need to tell you something. Is this a matter to be presented within a community? Dear, how can you think in this way? "Yearning to keep her head upright" Shall I leave if it's done? "Futile pests coming in your way" 'A small desire to be caressed...' Death was passed to us through Eve. Due to her disobedience, Eve brought in death for herself and the human race. Mother Mary brought salvation and life through her obedience. "When trapped...at her wit's end..."

"...shaking those lovely earrings" (upbeat rock song) Hey, ride properly you idiot! Hey...hey...stop! Stop the bike! What is your name? Where is your house? Look at him. He looks like a drunkard. Take his details, charge him a fine and let him go. Don't take up such headaches. You won't get your bike. Come tomorrow morning to the station and take it. Keep the change. Thank you Sir. This is too much. Drink less. You are like a brother to me. He won't listen to me how much ever I say. Where's your bike? My bike is at the police station. You go with your brother and get it. What's the case? It's a drink and drive case. Ok, give me one hours time. - I'll go and get it. - Hmm. Don't bring it here. It's for you. Are you mad? Hey... Do what I say. Keep the bike with you. Ok, come and have your food. You're eating your food daily after it has turned cold. It's become a daily routine. He can't be reformed. You clean the room and give the key to the owner in the morning. Okay, brother (Phone chimes) Shucks! Your seat has already been given, Sir. You didn't pick up the call when I called you. What rubbish is this? There is a seat behind. Go and sit there. You go and sit there. Is it a big issue if this seat is allotted? You can go and sit anywhere. I didn't book the ticket for that. Sir...sir... Young man...hey young man... Chetta, don't make it an issue. I'll sit behind. Bro...please. Look at him! He is completely sloshed! Switch off the lights. It's none of our business. (Burping) Which stuff did you have? Vodka. He has glutted on some substandard stuff and calls it Vodka. Keep quiet. Hey, please dear, come! Oh...nuisance! What's the matter? You created all the ruckus to sit on a seat reserved for ladies. I was expecting some chick here. Just to simply woo her. Who is Lakshmi, your girlfriend? My mother. I am Mike. Antony. Isn't Mike a boyish name? Hmm, my real name is Sara. I went to change it. I'm on my way back from there. Is it like publishing it in the gazette? It's something like that...organ reassignment! Huh? Gender reassignment! The bus will halt for ten minutes. Those who wish to have refreshments can carry on. Don't be late. Come back fast. Aren't you eating? I'm not hungry. Will you be hungry if you have a couple of drinks? Do you have any stuff with you? I have it in the bag. I want someone to accompany me while having food. At home I will have my grandma, Roby or someone else. This is my favourite brand. It is a local one. The dew from heaven! We brewed it ourselves. Why are you taking it away? Do you want more? Not this but the... I am exactly like a boy. I have only this hindrance in my body. So why not get rid of it? It's just that simple! What happened? Have you never got a kiss from anyone? - Have you got it? - Yes. My first kiss was when I was 13 years old. Oh...so you had a boyfriend at that time too? Not mine, but my mom's boyfriend. I'm sorry. Let me go and pee. Ok This is what I feel jealous of men the most. You can pour it off anywhere and at anytime. Ayo...Anto...chetta... Chetta...there are people to get in. Stop...! Hey... Shucks with his peeing!! What a bad time! Antony John. This is like inviting unwanted trouble. I also saw that they both were totally sloshed. If we allow them to travel in this bus we'll lose our job. Yes exactly. - I got stuck there for a while. - Hmm. At my place, this is called dozed off for a while. Come fast, the bus will go. - Did the bus leave? - Hmm... This is what happens when you're drunk and out of your senses. You will miss the bus, kiss and all. How will we go now? Why are you behaving like a girl? How do we boys go for a trip? We'll go like that. You're dazed because you haven't eaten anything. Hold this, let's eat something. - Take your seat Ma'am. - No issues,bro. Is she a girl or a boy? (Playing Tamil movie song on radio) She's a girl. I'm a big foodie. I have to eat till my stomach is full. At home there are tons of complaints. You'll get fat. If you get fat, nobody will marry you. Anyways, who's gonna marry me? Let's wash our hands and come. I am not coming. Where did I keep? Hey sister...my hand...my hand. It's been a while since you're upto this mischief. If you dare touch me again... ...I'll kick your balls off Let's go. Meanwhile, a guy tried to touch me. A single dialogue from my side frightened him and he put his hands off me. I think you're a man of few words. No, I do speak. I'm very affable! I understood that. I'm meeting someone like you for the first time. Me too. "My heart is brimming..." "...through you" Hey...hey buddies...why don't you join us? It's my friend's birthday. Come on. "Hey...hey my heart!" "Hey...are you just..." "...moving away, far away?" "Hey...hey my heart!" "Hey...are you just..." Have one, bro. "...coming this way?" "The skies forming a marquee" "Scintillating stars beside us" "This night offers a celebration today...oh my life" "Hey...hey my heart!" "Hey...are you just..." "...moving away, far away?" "Hey...hey my heart!" "Hey...are you just..." "...coming this way?" You haven't received any phone call as yet. Don't you have a phone? I don't have anyone special to call or say anything. You are very lucky. Isn't your life awesome? You can live your life to your will without any restrictions. Having someone in your life is always great. What job do you do? I am a Collector. Ehh? Really?! Oh... ...you were lying. No problem. Telling lies doesn't make us crooks. The desires we have within us are what we express as lies. KL-56... This truck is heading to Kerala. Or is it only till here? They didn't halt when we asked for a lift. Now they have stopped in front of us to pee. That's it. Chetta, can you give us a lift? "The encompassing of the moonlight" "The gradual fall of the cool misty rains" "You offered me a horizon of dreams" "The world strides fast without gasping" "The times we've forgotten to smile" "Who are you offering me happy sights?" "Let's tread new paths" "Seeking new dreams..." "It's time to fly high" "Far...far away" Bye... "High...high...higher away" (Bus route announcements) Chetta, is this bus heading to Kattappana? Yes. (Indistinct chatter) I will never forget you. After all we were booze buddies. What is your plan after reaching your hometown? I want to hang myself to death on this 18th. Aha...! That's an awesome plan! I will be late to reach there. I have certain things to do after this organ reassignment. We will meet up in the other world. "This heart..." "...like the moonlit path" "Here..." "...in search of a space" We'll reach soon. Yes move on...right. This land got bushy so soon. Hey...son...Antony. It's been a while since I saw you. Go on with your work, Chetta. See you later. - Hey, did you recognise him? - Yes,I did. He is Johnettan's son. Didn't he go with the cash from the sale of his land? I heard he is drunk all the time. You continue ploughing. He is waiting to blabber something. I have to do all the job, but his wages can't be reduced. My SIM is not working. That's why I didn't call. I have a splitting headache. Let me have a nap. All these parents calm down only after we are confined... ...to wedlock and settled with kids. In that way, you are fortunate. - I didn't mean like... - Hey bro... Hey dimwit, I'm seeing you after such a long time. At least give me a hug. This guy! - Where is Swathi? - She hasn't come. Do you have anyone else to inform? No worries bro, because it's been a long time. You don't want to see anyone of us, but it's not the same with us. Hey... are you aware of something? His family is seeking marriage alliances even for him. Why did you say, 'Even for me'? I just said it simply. There are few who were saved marrying someone else just because you were in love. Their blessings will always be with you. If so, I'll have your wife's blessings always. What did you say? I'll throw sand at you! He is cracking jokes, huh! Hey, what about Sanal? He is still here. I didn't inform him that you've come. Sara, this isn't a trivial matter for which you are asking me help. I cannot stand by you in this matter. What friend are you then? Sara, this is not something childish as you think. Don't jump into decisions for such silly thoughts. Just tell me, if you can stand by me or not. Not just me, no one will stand by you. Are you coming? Sara... Hey, pass me the oil. I've no oil or kerosene, adjust with that beer. Do some job man...at least something. Are you the one going for a job daily? Get lost man! Don't be too proud just because you've a job, you crap! It's been a while. Will that girl continue living like a boy? Buzz off, man! Already her gait and mannerisms are like that. Not like you roasting chicken... Look at the choices of people! If these women behave like this, what will we men do? Not we, only you. You will be in trouble. If you open your mouth now, I'll shove these embers in your mouth. He is blabbering since long! Tell him to shut up. - You keep quiet. - That's all you need? - Do you want tapioca? - No. Give him some. Now you do what you want. - I am leaving. - Hey where are you going? Mom is alone at home. I'm going. Bro, roast the remaining before leaving. - Bro, you do it on your own. - How will I roast it? - Hey, I'm also coming. - Yes come. - I am leaving. - Hey please don't go. I have some work to complete, that's why. - Tell him some more stories too. - Goodnight. Goodnight, sweet dreams. - You walk ahead, I'll come. - Hmm. Mithun must have come. Go on, go on, all the children get inside your homes. Buzz off man. That was not needed. Bro, let's sit until sunrise. By the way... ...that girl's story sounds great... I liked it. That's the spirit, be it a boy or a girl. We should take decisions and move ahead. - Cheers... - Cheers! Antony... Hey... Somebody named Mike has come to see you. Let's go. Look at his sly smile. You carry on. I need to go to the town. Ok. - Bye, Mike. - Hmm. How did you reach here? Is it tough for me to find your house after seeing your license? What's your plan? Where is your mom? She will be somewhere around. Come. Hey...hey... Anyways, you are planning to die on this 18th. Do me a small help before that. You should come with me for the surgery. No one I know is ready to stand by me. In your case, you aren't worried about tomorrow. Hey, it's a harmless service. Hey, just help me. - The surgery is at Mysore, right? - Yes. You have to be there only at the time of the surgery. In between we have to go there a few times. Till then where will you stay? Hey, I don't want a big space. We boys can share a room. Your room may be upstairs? Just come up. When will this get over? I will make you free before 18th. After the surgery starts you can go. Later, I'll appoint a home nurse and adjust. It's good! "The Good Death!" Anyone will feel like dying after reading this. Antony John. Have you been to a college? 'On a four legged cot, under a three winged fan...' '...when you strive for a baby having two legs, please remember me...Swathi.' Who is this Swathi? Was there love between the two of you? Or was it eternal love? He wasn't the man you are seeing now. It's like we say, that a single moment is enough to turn our life topsy-turvy. For better or for worse. A bit... Please... There is something. You come. - Hey... - Look. Mom... I'll call Antony. How did you come? Come mom. - You go. - Ok. - We will be there inside. - Ok...ok. What's it man? Come. "This day, these eyes..." "...seek for a new era" "Without seeking for tomorrow..." "...you own this day today" "To wander without limits..." "...no one needs to give consent" "To continue the journey on this land..." "...there is no time to spare" "The skies above...and this world..." "...sing in unison" "Move Your Body..." "Go Let Loose, Dance n Party" "While we dance..." "...the world grooves along" "Move Your Body" "Let's groove and just go crazy" "When you be the change..." "...everything evolves along" Chetta, one coffee. Move. Move man!! Hey... What's your problem? Hey...hey...get away...get away. Come on, speak up "Let's pen our own tale..." "...seek for your own path" "Lending shoulder to one another all day and night" "Let's rise from the fall..." "...and seek light in the darkness" "Let's seek into souls with our soul" "...exchanging everything" "With all shackles broken apart..." "...let's protect the valiance of our dreams" "When sorrows engulf us..." "...let's face it with a smile" "The skies above...and this world..." "...sing in unison" "Move Your Body..." "Go Let Loose, Dance n Party" "While we dance..." "...the world grooves along" "Move Your Body" "Let's groove and just go crazy" "When you be the change..." "...everything evolves along" "Everybody come on" "Move Your Body..." "Go Let Loose, Dance n Party" "While we dance..." "...the world grooves along" "Move Your Body" "Let's groove and just go crazy" "When you be the change..." "...everything evolves along" (Applause) Mom...! (Planting a kiss) (Indistinct chatter) (Mocking his mother) How dare you mock my mother? Hey hit him! Hey hit him! Hey hold him! Get aside. Bash him to death! Leave. Leave. Leave. Move aside. Come on. Hey leave him. Catch him. Move away. Hey Umesh come on...Antony! Antony! Antony! Hey...hey...move. Leave him...I said leave him! Move away. Antony leave him...leave him What nonsense are you doing? Move away! Hey, Sanal! Hey...Antony... Sanal...Sanal...hey... Hey...get a car...get a car. (Indistinct chatter) Sir, take care at that side. (Indistinct fights) Hey your mom has come. She is in the office. Hey...he is running away. If your son has some mental disorder, keep him at home. You shouldn't send him to a place where other students are studying. You are just crying. Don't you have any opinion to say about him? Huh...? He is a good child. I...have done...! How can you leave after smashing your classmate's head? Huh? - You can go after the police comes. - Yes let the police come. You can go only after the police comes. Get away. Hey...what is it? Hey...move...move away. Hey catch him...hey stop there. (Indistinct shouts) Hey block him. (Indistinct shouts) Mom! 'Oh...Mother!!' Mom...! (Crowd screaming) 'Oh...Mother!!' 'Don't get doused...' '...oh my dawn...!' 'Don't go away.' - Will he be here? - Here? - Yes...look there. - Stop there. Shucks...! Come bro, let's go home. Get up...come. - Hey should I help? - No need. Get on to the bike. - Lift your leg. - Be careful. - Did he get on? - Yes. Let's go. Yes...pull over here. Here...hmm. Antony, get down. We've reached home. Hey hold him. Slowly. Place him a bit further. Hey, won't you drop me home? Yes, I will. Intermission I lost my mother because of my flaws. To listen to her... ...and to answer her back... ...I was the only one she had. Anyway, you don't get upset. I'll go only after fulfilling your wish. The first step is counselling. You can attend it today itself Sara. There is a one week time after that. That's the time for you to rethink about this again. After that we can start the hormonal injections to cut the menstrual cycles. Before that you have to undergo some tests to know how the body reacts to this. After that we have to reassign each organ one by one. If you wish you can continue the hormone treatments even after the surgery. Because it's a long process. But once the surgery starts, you cannot back off from this Sara. That means you can't be a girl like before. I know, Doctor. Anyway it's upto you. I have my reasons. Sara, can you wait outside for a minute? Antony, this is not a trivial matter. Once Sara starts changing totally, we can't predict how she will react. It can cause some serious health issues, both mentally and physically. Why should I? I haven't even obeyed the priest in my hometown or my grandmother. Then how come I'll obey the doctor from Mysore? Why are you reassigning this? Why are you asking me like that? Simply. Within five minutes, those guys sitting there will start staring at me. That's because I am a girl. You are right. Boys always have the freedom for everything. They don't have to be back home by 6 pm. They can go anywhere at any odd time. Chetta, please. Thank you. They don't have to give dowry to get married. They don't have to hear the complaint that how will you get married... ...if you don't know how to cook. They can have a bath publicly, however they wish to. Then there's no issue if you don't have a bath for a week, just like you. And do you know, what is the most exciting thing? You can sleep with anyone at anytime. You don't have to worry about periods, pregnancies or pain. Not all men are always in the mood for intimacy. You can also do that at anytime. Shall I ask you something? Anyway I am going to go ahead with my surgery. I want to know how it works. Bro, I thought it is for you. I searched a lot bro, a lot. All of them are straight. This one is my friend's friend, Lily. When I told her the matter she was also very interested. We are waiting down. I'll go and meet the person. Bro, that's done...ok. Let's start with some wine. Sure. Are you a bisexual? I haven't identified yet. I fell in love with that girl. She was great! So then, did you propose her? I told her, I'll come back after the surgery. She said she will wait. What happened? Nothing. There, that was our usual spot. - It was awesome. - Oh...! Hi. You brought me here to see this scoundrel. Bro, don't go away please. Leave me. Bro, we don't want this issue among us anymore. We'll solve it. Hmm...let's solve it. Hey! - Hit me man...hit me! - Sanal... Hit me back! - Qasi,leave him. - Leave me! Hey Sanal,wait... - Let him hit me. - No, Sanal, don't do it. Hey...no... Who is he? He is not the old Antony. Shucks! Hey, tragedies aren't the only experiences. You will face many tragedies in life. Learn to accept them and live. You are already prepared to die, then why are you scared? Hey Anto...come on jump. Hey come on. Don't look for him. He is the only one among us who can swim back to the bank. What happened? Hey Qasib, Swathi has delivered a baby. Who? - Swathi has delivered a baby. - Has your wife delivered a baby? Hey deaf guy, not my wife. - Swathi. - Hmm... - Huh...? - Has delivered a baby. Hey, Swathi has delivered a baby. Come up...come. My hand... At least hold this cover. You can hold that. Hey your thralldom won't work here. Isn't it autocracy? Get your hands off me. I can't carry this weight and now he is... I feel the fruits are less. So you could have bought some jackfruits and mangoes too. That's right, your head was empty. It's a hospital. Come out I'll show you. Sara. What's this, a fruit shop? You eat it. Then who else will eat? - Dear... - Not now Mom. Was it a smooth labor, aunty? Yes, it was a very smooth labor. (Fondling sounds) Oh...no...no! Where is Mithun? He has gone home to get some dresses. Tell him we want a treat. Yes, you can give us a treat. - Did the baby have milk? - Hmm. - What is the baby's weight? - About 3 kg. Oh nice! - Hey... - Hmm? Why are you not saying anything? How is my baby? She is beautiful. The baby looks exactly like her mother. Her same eyes and nose. I felt magical. Having a baby exactly like us. This is the last photo my Papa and Mummy took when they were in Dubai. After my 12th grade. After a month, Papa passed away. Then Mom and me never stayed there. So, you have no relatives? I have many. But none of them come here. Both of them had a registered marriage, opposing their families. Oh...that was great. Both of them were very happy together. You have no reflex at all. "This looks like fantasy" "This looks like fantasy" "Alien from the heaven" "Tryin' to drive the demon" "If you could ever take it forward you're the peace of demon" "If it's not happening I'm not a wanna be" "It is all fantasy" 'Palamaner stop is about to come Anybody wants to get down?' 'Come...come faster' After 2-3 days it will start reacting in the body. Don't roam around outside a lot. You have medicines. We can start the surgery after two weeks. You will have to continue the hormone treatment even after that. Relax. Let Sara be under observation for some time. Ok Sir. I have some doubts in Sara's case. Such impulsive decisions may not be right always. You still have the time to rethink. I think you should talk to her. She is confused. Doctor, at the end of the day it's her choice. All I can do is stand by it. Anyway...we'll meet again. Let's go. I thought you will come back now itself as a boy. I am already like that. Then why do you want to change? Come, the pharmacy is on the other side. I have to take medicines for two weeks. Till then I have been advised to take rest. It's just nonsense. That's meant for girls. After all, we have masculine bodies... What are you planning to do? Don't you need a job? I worked at few places. But I can't focus at all. We'll set it right. Aren't you here for some time? Come. Master, shall I try to combat? Only if you have learnt it. Or else your soft spots will be hurt. I have learnt it. I've experienced it many times. - Hey, what have you done? - What wrong did I do? Do you want to know what you've done? You should combat after knowing the strength of your opponent. She said she has learnt it. Why are you simply blaming me? Are you finding it difficult to walk? No. Do you want to go to the hospital? What was the need for all this? You could simply sit quietly somewhere. Why did you go for such unwanted things? Who is that guy? He played a foul. Doctor had advised you to take two weeks of rest. You buzz off. I am still strong. (Giggles) Laugh once more. Did it hurt? No. Now? Is it paining now? No. Now? No. Come get up.

She is my mother. A missing complaint has been registered. You have to come to this station as soon as possible. Ok. Shall we take her home, Sir? Didn't you hear what your daughter said? It's not the duty of the police to hand her over to you. Especially when Sara has a clear decision. Isn't her safety also important Sir? Safety is not something you will get only in your own house. Not like that. You may go after giving a statement to that writer. Hmm. What settlement was that, Sir? You can request your daughter but can't force her. - Shall I take a leave? - Hmm. Why is the sea called Mother Sea? Is the sea a woman? Why can't we call Father Sea? I think masculinity has started affecting. (FATHER SEA) Papa...can you take me to a ship? Hmm...ship...! I think you like the sea a lot dear. Papa will take you. Someone has come with Sebastian to see the shed. Oh...they have come. They said they will be here in the evening. - Sherly,bring the key with you. - Hmm. Who is it, Mom? Dear, you continue drawing. This will be enough. If we could get in and see... What was it used for before? It was meant for my business, so left empty. My school was in Bangalore. The place is for him. - What are you planning to start here? - Taekwondo. That's great. My daughter is very interested in this. - She can also study. - Yes, why not. The place is not too old. It has a power supply. - Hello. - Hmm. - How is your job going on? - Going on well. - Do you have enquiries? - Yes,I do. - Oh Abraham... - Greetings,Chetta. Can you give the key to the workers in the morning? - The work isn't done as yet? - No, it'll take 2 more days. - Ok. - See you. I have to go the Spices Board tomorrow early morning. So you keep the key with yourself. Don't make them wait. One... - Because I liked Taekwondo... - Two... - I also joined his classes. - Three... Four... Five... Six... Nothing can replace money. Smart men snatched all the money from you. My dear Sherly all this is usual in business. Do you know, the deduction for your loan goes from my salary now. Couldn't you be born as a boy? At least we would've had a man at this home. Sherly! What's wrong with you, mom? Come on... Everything was fine in the beginning. Lift both your hands up... ...1...2...3...go. Very good. Come. 1...2...3...go. Wonderful! Come. 1...2...3... Hey! Kapil...come on. Yes...very good. Continue. - Are you done for the day? - Yes, almost. - How is the class going on? - Going good. Sara is a talented girl. - I would have come there, Mom. - No problem. That is good...that is good. Keep going. Ready...1...2... When I realised that his intentions were not right... ...I discontinued the Taekwondo classes. Good morning master. Good morning master. The house ran in accordance with what Mom felt was right. When Papa was fed up with the situation at home, he left home on a Christmas night. Sara! Papa got employed at his previous estate. He was very happy there. He was getting love and concern there, that he didn't get at home. I didn't tell anybody when Papa called. I realised that he was struggling hard to overcome solitude. I was adamant to go and stay with him. He was living in a cramped room with many inmates. He avoided me saying that it wasn't suitable to accommodate a girl too. I was very angry with him since he left me and went. Thinking on his side... ...Papa must have done the right thing. Papa always said that everyone should live their life according to their wish. Hey...get out! Don't act over smart. Better stay in your limits. What the heck is stirring you up? Hey you! I left home that day with the gold Mom reserved for my marriage. I should have bashed him up more. (Door bell rings) Come...let's go. Sara... Antony... Antony... Antony... Get your hands off me. Mom, who is this man? You... Mama! Mama! Hey...you! Hey...you! Open the door! Mama! Girls should be brought up with composure and discipline. (Phone chimes) Hello Sir. This is regarding Miss Sara Thomas's gender reassignment surgeries. The first one is scheduled on this 23rd. We just want to reconfirm your appointment. - Yeah...we'll be there. - Thank you Sir. You have a happy news. It was a call from the hospital. They asked you to get ready for the surgery. "The rhythm of life has broken" "Like the unmatched strings of the harp" "The soul is burning with tears" "How to wipe off this darkness?" Which is the surgery tomorrow? "As the bodies bond..." Mastectomy. "...in unison" "How will we part ways today?" Removal of breast. "Come on speak oh my life" "...oh my life..." "Is this a new birth or a death?" "Flames oh flames!" "How can I forsake your shadow?" "The thirst of the burning soul" "Withstanding it today" "It isn't the night, nor the day" Is she still stern on reassignment? That's her personal choice. Let her reassign. "We are puppets in the hands of the unknown" "Wounds deep down" "Are we parting ways?" "Come on speak life..." "...oh my life" Enough, come let's go. A bit more time. "Is this a new birth or a death?" You go. Do what you want. "Flames oh flames" "How can I forsake your shadow?" Sara's medicines. - Sister, one minute. - Ok, make it fast. - So. - I... My job is over. All the best for Mike. Sara...are you ok? "Far away to unseen distances..." "...a piercing pain flew off" "In the blood streams..." "has a new pulse taken birth?" "A new dawn has arisen in the Earth and skies here..." "...here, here... this way" "Skies... the heavenly skies..." "...pristine forests and valleys..." "...offer here today..." "...the first dew drops of life" "Rhythms and it's beats..." "...here am I, listening to it intently" "Brimming in me, is it..." "euphoria or melancholy?" "Is it ecstasy, rising like waves of sea?" "My greetings to the luminescence..." "...I can feel it, this magic" "The skies..." "...far away at distance" "There's time..." "There's love..." "His Grace..." "...in you lies happiness and solace..." "...first" "Oh no..." "Skies... the heavenly skies..." "...pristine forests and valleys..." "...offer here today..." "...the first dew drops of life" "Hues and fragrances..." "...here am I , holding them close" "Brimming in me, is it..." "...the fire of life or darkness?" "Is the thirst within, burning in me like embers?" "My greetings to the luminescence..." "A new paradise..." "like the garden of Eden" "like the garden of Eden..." "like the garden of Eden..." And welcome back. This is RJ Mike. And you're listening to Music Monk, 96.5 FM. We were talking about travels. It's all about the journey, not about the destination. Only when we are lost in our travels, do we explore new ways. So don't be afraid to get lost. In our life there may have been... ...some unforgettable... ...or some travels that have created an impact. So... ...let's hear each other out. The number to call ... ...is 7-3-5-6-0-4-4-4-8-4. Share with me your journey. So let's meet up again tomorrow morning. Have your stories ready. This is RJ Mike, signing off. This is your own Music Monk. Hey Anto... Come on jump. You are already prepared to die. Then why this fear? You don't have reflex at all? Mike. Someone has come to see you. Who is it? Mastectomy? A person can decide for himself, what to do with his own body. See, this is a like a metamorphosis. After gender affirmation surgery... ...it is important that you shouldn't feel incomplete. After the transition, your confidence should increase. I had a great life only after the surgery. But in your case, I can't expect that completion. If a person's assigned gender is that of a woman... ...but if his mental orientation is that of a man... ...then he can undergo physical transition. The reasons you are saying now to transform into a man... ...aren't silly in my opinion. I can figure out social reasons in it. The hierarchy, privileges a man enjoys in our society... ...can't be enjoyed by you if you continue as a woman. That's why you desired to transform into a man. You should strive to achieve them by continuing as a woman. That should be your motive, Sara. Don't you think you should strive to achieve it? You took away the name I had reserved for myself. Mike... Huh...? Huh? 'There is a cafeteria close by.' - 'Shall we have a cup of tea? - Yeah, sure.' 'Where were you all this while?' 'Amsterdam.' - 'Did you visit the weed cafes there? - I didn't go there.' 'Then why did you pack your bags for Amsterdam?' 'That's not the only thing there.' - 'Where were you? - I was around here.' 'But I never expected you at all.'
