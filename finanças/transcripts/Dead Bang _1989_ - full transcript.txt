[plane engine revving] Shit. [water flowing] Hi, daddy. - Hi, daddy. - Merry Christmas. Christina, it's time to go in. We're going in again. - Come on, kids. Come on. - What? (male #1) 'If you want a Slurpee, you're out of luck.' (male #2) No, no. You're the one that's out of luck. We don't carry no more than $50 cash. It's the store policy. (male #2) It's okay. Just take out what's over there. - 'Is there anything else?' - No, there's nothing. Your wallet? Oh, I forgot that. Here you are. - 'Do you believe in God?' - Yes. Yes, I do. That's nice.. ...because I have the instrument...of your salvation. Please. Please. I didn't look at you. I can't identify you. No. But I can identify you. You are a dead nigger. No. Please, no. [gunshots] (dispatcher on radio) 'Attention, all units.' 'Armed robbery just occurred at convenience store.' 'Foothill and Loma. Store manager seriously wounded.' 'Following description of one suspect' 'male, Caucasian, 18 to 25, 5'10" to 6'2", medium build.' 'Nothing further.' This is Kimble. I'm making a stop at the intersection of Foothill and Noble. Possible suspect matching the description of the stop and rob. Good morning. 'Is there any problem, officer'' No. You're just up a little early this morning, aren't ya? It's the Santa Anas. I find it difficult to sleep when the winds start blowing in from the desert. - Yeah. - Hey, by the way. Merry Christmas. Yeah, Merry Christmas. You got some ID on ya? ID? Sure. Ah, is a driver's license okay? That'll be fine. What? Wait a minute. [gunshots] (male #3) 'Homicide?' (male #4) Yeah, that's us, alright. Our day begins when yours ends. But I'm glad to see somebody's out here crushing crime. Personally, I was hoping to get one full night's sleep before Christmas. Fat, fucking chance. - You Homicide? - Yeah. You the handling unit? - Yup. - What you got? Pictures of the casings and the body. Take some overalls, and then step out of the way. The officer that was involved in the shooting over here.. What's his name? (male #5) 'Gary Kimble.' (male #6) 'I'm telling you, I got it covered.' 'Oh, okay. How does 20 pounds of ice sound?' 'I think that ought to do it.' 'I got-I got five cases of beer being delivered by 5 o'clock.' 'Yes. Three quarts of bourbon and the plastic glasses.' 'Okay?' 'I-I'll be there no later than 7:00.' 'What? Plenty women. Foxes. All shapes and sizes, okay?' 'Okay. Take care.' 'Hey, Beck, still living in Heartbreak Hotel?' No, I got a suite at the Bonaventure. (Bilson) We're having a party tonight. The Lonely Guys Christmas Eve Ball. 'A little something for the bachelors, the divorced' 'and the disenfranchised.' 'It's gonna be over at Brubaker's place.' 'We're gonna have plenty of booze' 'maybe even some fine women.' 'You really ought to drop by.' [telephone ringing] 'Homicide. Bilson.' 'Yes, I invited Eileen.' 'I told you I'd invite Eileen and I did invite Eileen.' 'Yes, she's very anxious to see you.' 'Why else would you think she's coming?' 'Yes, and she's coming for the same reason.' 'Seven o'clock, I said I'd be there at seven o'clock, okay?' Mr. Webly, this is Jerry Beck, Sheriff's Homicide. I'd like to talk to you about one of your people. A...Robert Bobby Burns. I need his package. His package? Come on, this is Christmas Eve day. Yeah, I'm aware of that. I'm halfway out of my office. Got last minute shopping to do. I'm sorry to hear that, but I have a suspect and I don't even know what he looks like. What makes you so sure Burns is your guy, if I may ask? Because I checked the parole index and his name comes up. He's a convicted robber, he's recently paroled. And he's at the top of my list. I...This is Christmas Eve day. I have a family. Don't you? I used to have a family. I don't have a family now. What I do have is a dead cop and I need that package. You don't understand. I'm leaving now to do my shopping. I am going. I told the wife two minutes ago, I am leaving. I understand. Tell you what, you go do your shopping and I'll see you tomorrow morning. How's that? Tomorrow morning is Christmas morning. Sorry, Webly, but you can't have it both ways. How's your office around 8 o'clock sound? Fuck you. Have it your way. 8:30. And fuck you. - Here you go. - Oh, thanks, Gates. - I'm Ed Gates. - Nice to meet you. Excuse me a second, thanks. First Christmas away from home? That obvious, huh? Lucky guess. I'm Linda. Jerry Beck. I've heard your name. Um, I know, you're the one working on the murder of the sergeant that was killed. How's it coming? It's coming. You don't sound convinced. Well, right now I'm not convinced of a lot of things. 'Tis the season to be jolly. That least of all. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to sound glib. [clears throat] Well, it was nice meeting you. Merry Christmas. Ah, Linda? Don't go. (female #1) 'Carol. Carol, come here.' Ah...I-- - Good morning. - I have to go. Well, you're certainly dressed for it. - I was gonna fix breakfast. - Oh.. - Ah, you want a cup of coffee? - No, thank you. [airplane engine revving] Yeah. I'll get you an Alka-Seltzer. - What? - What? What? Oh, Alka-Seltzer. Here, it'll fix you right up. - No, thank you. - Here you go. Oh, what was that? That is the Burbank Airport. The world's quietest airport. At least that's what they say if you complain. What's your hurry? Well, you said you had an 8:30 appointment. Um, ah.. Well.. ...thank you for a lovely evening, really. What happened? Nothing. It's-it's nothing to do with you. I'm the only one here. Ah, what I mean is, it's not you, it's-it's me. Great. [airplane engine revving] You look like shit. - Thanks. I feel like shit. - You must be Beck. Don't bust my balls, Webly. I'm in no mood. You're in no mood? I'm in no mood. My wife is in no mood. Today is Christmas, Beck. Well, judging by the weight, Mr. Burns has kept pretty busy. Eight arrests, five convictions in California, two in Texas. 'It's all in there.' 'Notice we're the only ones in here.' Hey. If Bobby had wanted to go the other way he could have been anything he wanted. He's extremely bright. IQ of a 135. His younger brother, John on some scholarship to the University of New Mexico. Uh, School of Chemical Engineering. Don't underestimate Bobby. Also, don't underestimate his mother. She's a Hells Angels old lady if you're thinking of dropping by. Well, good luck. If I were you I would give AA some thought. Alcoholism is a disease, you know. Thank you, Webly. I'll keep that in mind. - Where's your car? - I jogged over. I live 1.4 miles from here. I jog over three times a week-- - You jogged over? - Yeah. You should try it. Very good for the cardiovascular system. Webly, jump in. Let me drive you home. It's Christmas. Give your system a break. That's my street. That's Radford. Hang a left. 'Hey, you gotta make a left right here. Left.' Jeez, what you-you past my street. Need a little favor, Webly. Need you to drop by mom's with me. You know the rules. Convict gives up his right to search and seizure but only in the presence of a parole officer. That's you. This is kidnapping, Beck. Are you aware of this that this is kidnapping? No, no, no. Kidnapping is a felony. This is just a little favor. With you, I can walk right into mom's place and if he's there, he's mine. Like it or not, that's the way it is. You are a real asshole. You know, in case you haven't noticed, it's daylight. [knocking] [knocking continues] What the fuck do you want, asshole? - Sheriff's Homicide. - Go fuck yourself. You son of a bitch.. Ah! Ah! You wanna give me a hand here, Webly? - Is that alright? - Yes. That's just lovely. - Good. - Thank you. This is an exciting life you lead. Sheriff's Homicide. Now, you guys calm down and cooperate or I'll rip your heads off and tear this place apart. (male #7) 'What the fuck?' Go back to sleep there, Sluggo. 'It's Christmas morning. What's going on..' Alright. - I'm looking for Bobby Burns. - Who? Don't lie to me, asshole. Robert Bobby Burns. - Still in the joint. - You must be John, aren't you? His brother. Where is he? You wouldn't tell me if you knew, would you? Well, no. Not really, officer. Are you okay? You don't look very good. Nothing a month in Hawaii wouldn't cure. Have you seen him? Look, he's my brother. I-I don't know what you think he's done but he's got his own life. His job is to do what he wants to do and your job is to find him, if you think you need to. Other than that, I really can't tell you much. I go back to school in two days, just here on Christmas break. Is your mom in there? She awake? Merry Christmas, huh? Yeah. [glass clinking] [dramatic music] [creaking] Uh. [panting] [panting continues] - Oh! - Ah! - Hey! - A-ah! Hey, where are you... where are you going? Hey. [dramatic music continues] [panting] [panting continues] [breathing heavily] [tires screeching] [screeching continues] [honking] [crash] [honking] [crash] [panting] Ah! A-ah! [panting continues] Shit. [police sirens] Well, well, what have we here, guys? A little domestic spat on our good Lord's birthday? - Sheriff's Homicide. - You gotta be kidding. Oh, God. Do me a favor, cuff this asshole. What are you doing to this man? - Who are you? - Elliot Webly, parole officer. Good God. What have you done now? I got sick, Webly. What the hell does it look like? I don't mind helping, guys, but you threw up all over this guy. Jesus. Son of a bitch. You fucking threw up on me, man. Jesus, shut him the fuck up. My head's killing me. - Shut him up. - What've you got on him? I don't know. Put him through the machine. (male #8) 'Get me outta this. Come on. Jesus Christ.' 'Oh, man, you're a real asshole. You know that?' - I got him, didn't I? - 'It's all over me, man.' 'C'mon. Let me up.' 'Why don't you just shit on me, while you're at it?' Think this will wash out of my tie? (dispatcher on radio) 'Seventy at Roscoe and Laurel Terrace.' 'Check. Ellis, James. Male, Caucasian.' 'Date of birth: 2-12-59.' 'No wants or warrants.' 'Currently on parole for armed robbery.' Alright. I'll take it from here. - Have a nice day. - Sorry, I have other plans. Ah, honey, I'm telling you the truth, sweetie. I-I think the man is actually physically dangerous. Uh-huh, wait, wait a minute, he's doing something. Me? I'm at a Chinese restaurant. Honey, sweetie, I don't think the Chinese celebrate Christmas. How long is your tail, parolee? I got three more years, if you violate me. Shit. You're bought and paid for. When Bobby got out of the joint, he called me. We hung out together. No big deal. How long ago was that? I don't know. A month ago. He's waiting for some guys to show up. He was doing a hell of a lot more than that. He was capering, wasn't he? You know, I don't have to tell you shit. Not without a PO, I don't. I got a PO. He's on the phone lying to his wife. Now keep talking. When did these guys show up? - Two days ago. - Who were they? I don't know, I never seen them before. [thud] Damn you! You better come up with something better than that. That's all I know, I swear. What is going on here? I'll be finished in a minute. - Keep an eye out for the cops. - I will not. I will not be a party to this, Beck. I will not allow this to happen under my aegis. - Under your what? - My aegis. My...ah, auspice. I'm responsible here. You hear that? He's responsible here, but I'm not. Now, goddamn it, I need some answers. I got a splitting headache. I'm seeing double. Shit, I think I'm gonna throw up. He-he took off in a wagon. A brown-maroon... maroon Ford wagon. He said something about going north to Bakersfield. But that's all. That's all. He didn't say any more and I didn't ask. That's it. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Don't puke. Don't puke. Good. What's gonna happen now? You wanna book this guy for parole violation? I certainly do not. It's your lucky day. [pager beeping] [breathing heavily] - How's the little woman? - Wonderful. Good. Uncuff him, will you? Yeah. This is Jerry Beck. Beck, this is John. Yeah. I've got a positive ID on your suspect. What? The stop-and-rob manager made him for sure. It's Burns, alright. He's got that tattoo on that right arm of his. The circle, the cross, the lightning bolts. It's Burns, for sure. [dramatic music] [piano music] [music continues] Hi. It's me. Merry Christmas. How are the kids? Good. Are you okay? Well, it hasn't exactly been a joyous holiday season for me either. I didn't mean anything by that. I just meant I know how you feel, that's all. By the way you didn't have to get a restraining order to keep me from stopping by the kids school. All you had to do was ask. It's not exactly like I've been hanging out in an overcoat with sunglasses, you know. Fine. Are the kids there? Because I'm their father. I'd like to talk to them. I'd like to wish them Merry Christmas. Oh, goddamn it, Gloria. Do we have to do this over every goddamn little thing? I'm their father. I wanna talk to them and I'd like to stop by later and give them their... their presents. Is that alright? I am their goddamn father, Gloria. How can they be in bed... They're not in bed! I can hear them in the fuckin' background! Gloria. Gloria, Gloria, don't hang up. Gloria? Goddamn! Jesus! Damn. Son of a bitch. [instrumental music] [music continues] Got a minute? - Oh, you startled me. - That makes two of us. What happened to you? How'd you find out? - I'm a cop, remember? - I'm sorry. You're sorry? It's not what you think. How do you know what I'm thinkin'? It's all over your face. You wanna come inside? I'll make some coffee. - That's bullshit. - Don't be rude. I'm sorry. I don't know what more-- I didn't come here for apology. Nothing that complicated. I just wanna know why? I wanted to tell you. I intended to. The next thing I knew, we were in bed. Bullshit. It didn't happen that fast. Well, for me it did. - Bullshit. Bullshit. - You keep saying that. That's because you keep lyin'. He was your husband. Goddamn-- - Who're you to judge me? - I don't know. Who do you have to be? - Hi, Linda. - Hi, Nancy. Hi, Alma. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Yes, he was my husband. Was. We'd been separated for eight months. God, why am I explaining myself to you? I don't have to explain myself to you. Well, it'd be damned nice if somebody did. Look. What exactly do you wanna know? Why did you jump in and out of bed with me so fast? If you wanted somethin', why didn't you just ask? Would've saved us a lot of time and energy. I didn't plan it. I didn't expect it. It was Christmas Eve and I was alone. That's all? No. That's not all. No. I wanted something else. At least, I thought I did. I wanted you to find the man who killed Gary. That's my job. Find him and kill him. - That's not my job. - He deserves to die. He may. Not the way you got in mind. See you around. [Spanish music] [indistinct chattering] [chattering continues] Merry Christmas to you too. [door slams] Fuckin' door was locked. That's against the law to keep an exit door locked during business hours. Right? - Ain't that right? - You're right, Ray. I'm right. Sleepy why don't we get everybody and get them down on the floor? (Sleepy) 'Turn down. Down.' (Raymond) 'Move it.' [indistinct Spanish chatter] Raymond! Cash register. [cash register rattling] Fucking thing won't open. [speaking Spanish] Shh. How does the cash register open? It sticks a little. It sticks, Raymond. You gotta hit it on the side. [banging] [clinking] Bingo. (Sleepy) 'This asshole's got pesos.' 'What the fuck are we gonna do with pesos?' [Spanish song] A-ah! 'A-ah! No!' 'A-ah!' [gunshot] [people screaming] [gunshots] [soft Spanish music] Jerry, 41. Yeah, Beck here. Walker Hillard here. Chief of Police in Cottonwood, Arizona. We got this little Mexican bar right outside of the.. Hey, come on, come on, come on, now down. No, I'm talking to the dog. Look, we got this little Mexican bar right outside of town. It got robbed last night. After they robbed it, they laid everybody on the floor and they shot 'em all. 'Now, I saw your teletype.' 'I wondered if it could have anything to do with that.' Sit tight, chief. I'll be right out. (chief #1) 'Beck, this could be your lucky day.' 'I got a report from one of my boys.' He spotted a maroon Ford wagon heading out to the Steadman ranch this morning. You're kiddin'? - I figure it's worth a shot. - Go on. Lombard, tow this thing out of here. Uh, chief, that's my car. [dramatic music] You know, if this turns out to be the right station wagon. Looks like we could be overmatched. How's that? Well, we've got a few handguns and maybe a shotgun or two. It says here on your deputy's report.. "The bad guys used automatics. Maybe a MAC-10 or two." That's what I call overmatched. Did you read this? Let me give you a piece of advice, Beck. You're a big city cop. If I was in the big city, I'd listen to you. But this ain't the big city. This is Cottonwood. Population 2,231 and I'm the Chief of Police. This is my town, my territory. To make it real simple nobody's gonna fuck with me here. [music continues] Dorothy, we're arriving at the Steadman place. Have Bonnie send over a couple of steak sandwiches from the office about 12:30. Thank you. What? Fries or baked? - What? - Fries. Fries. - Oh, fries, yeah. - Thanks, Hon. Fries. [gunshots] [gunshots] You don't need the gun, chief. Just tell 'em who you are. - Ah, fuck you, Beck. - Fuck you too, chief. And your goddamn French fries. [gunshots] [gunshots continue] [gunshots] [gunshots continue] [gunshot] [gunshots] [gunshots] (chief #1) 'Jackson. Get my hat.' 'Ah, never mind the hat. Get up here. Get up here.' 'Go on up the highway and flag down a car.' 'It could be hours before it dawns on Dorothy' 'that something's wrong.' (Jackson) 'Sir, I got two years seniority on Randall--' (chief #1) 'Because I'm sending you, now get the fuck out of here.' [helicopter hovering] Gentleman, who's Beck? - I'm Beck. - Arthur Kressler, FBI. I got your message about the break in the Kimble case and I flew right out. They said you were out of radio contact. What happened here? (Beck) 'Now, here's another one. Listen to this.' "This is a time to put our differences aside "and concentrate on what we share. Our common vision of a new America, purged of the--" Sounds like typical white-supremacy rhetoric to me. Yeah? You mean they just sit around and write this shit all the time? Half of them are in prison anyway. I suppose it helps them pass the time of day. Is that tape on your glasses? Yeah. I lost one of those little screws. Fell out. You know, what struck me is they keep talking about this big meeting that they're gonna have where they unite and create one organization, one power structure. You know what, they.. They get real carried away, man. Like they're the fuckin' Knights of the Round Table looking for King Arthur. God Almighty. Look, Beck, I understand what you're saying. All I'm trying to do is tell you what the bureau's position is on matters of this kind. That is that these groups have no unity or central authority. 'They're fragmented, territorial and isolated.' Come on. I'll give you a lift back in the chopper. I wanna get out an APB as soon as possible on that station wagon. 'Excuse me?' You don't wanna take any of these letters? Of course, I'll take them. But I doubt they're gonna carry much weight. [dramatic music] [music continues] (Beck) 'I called the captain's office'' 'The secretary said she's sure the money went out yesterday.' 'Yes, they're double-checking.' 'Meanwhile, I'm in Oklahoma City.' It is 36 fucking degrees here and I am freezing my ass off. Reimburse what, Henry? Do you have any idea what a goddamn divorce costs these days? Do you have an idea what these asshole lawyers cost? My credit cards are maxed out. I can't reimburse shit. Yes, alright. Alright. I'm on my way to Bogan now. Yeah. [instrumental music] (male #9) Yeah, it's like I told you I'd pick you up at the dance. No. No, that's what I said. Until the divorce goes through that's the way its gotta be. Look, honey, I got some business I gotta take care of. I'll see you later. Okay? Cute sign, chief. Yeah. Fucking ACLU, the commie-Jew bastards 'made us take it down. Used to be out front.' Don't make no difference. Ain't no nigger gonna stay in this town after sundown. Oh, by the way, I briefed my boys. 'No sign of a maroon Ford wagon so far.' Are you cold? Does it show? Yeah, blue lips give you away every time. You California boys got it too easy. All that sunshine and pussy thins the blood. [chuckles] Yeah, that's us. Land of milk and honey. Morning briefings on the beach. And every once in a while some asshole kills a cop and everybody gets pissed off. No more beach, no more sunshine and pussy until the guy's caught. Yeah, we draw straws out of our banana daiquiris. Which is why I'm here, chief. Short straw. You know a man named Gebhardt? Why? Well, I'd like to pay him a visit. I have reason to believe that Bobby Burns might contact him. Well, I think you got your names mixed up. Mmm, I don't think so, chief. I got his name, address and phone number out of Bobby's phone book. Maybe they have somethin' else in common. Maybe they like to hunt ducks. Oh, I think they've got a little more in common than ducks. Such as? Such as...white supremacy. Now, it's probably an alien concept around here. But there are actually groups of people who hate anyone that isn't like them. Gebhardt's place is about half an hour's drive from here. I got some business to take care of. I'll call you later this afternoon. I got the address and I got a car, chief. I won't wait long. Without me or a search warrant you won't set foot on Gebhardt's property. You got a search warrant? [door opens] Chief, there's a guy out there from the FBI. FBI? Shit. Well, bring him on in. Arthur Kressler, special agent assigned to the Kimble murder. I got word on your lead and I flew right out. How's it goin'? Well, to tell you the truth, a little slow. It's not the chief's fault. He's just been busy as hell these days. Right, chief? You didn't tell me the FBI was in on this. Oh, my fault, chief. Well, you see, I don't really think of Art as FBI. I think of him more as a friend. We hang out at the beach together. [dramatic music] [music continues] (Beck) 'You know, I don't believe I've ever seen' 'a cross like that on a church before, Reverend.' 'Exactly what denomination is that?' The Aryan Nation Church of Christ, Mr. Beck. How does that differ from, say, oh...the Baptists? It embodies the nucleus of what America once was and will be again, Mr. Beck. Uh-huh. And just what is that, Reverend? White and pure, Mr. Beck. Cleansed of its present racial impurities. Our nation has become adulterated by people of low blood. They act like parasites on a giant oak, feeding on it day by day sapping its strength. You make a powerful case, reverend. Frankly, I never looked at it that way. Huh, well, you're not alone, Mr. Beck. Fortunately, there are those among us who have. I guess that brings me to why we're here. Do you know this man? I don't believe I do, Mr. Beck. Mr. Beck. Thank you. His name is Robert Burns or Bobby. We have reason to believe he might contact you. Well, we have many friends who stop by, Mr. Beck. Friends from coast to coast and border to border. [footsteps] It's him. It's the guy with the cops from the Steadman place. It's the guy that sighted me with the 38. What the fuck is he doing in Oklahoma? I don't know. [birds chirping] Maybe he's a fed. He's no fed. Feds are neat. Whoever this guy is, he wouldn't last a week with the feds. The other guy's comin' over. Now, he is a fed. Look at him. 'So clean, you could shoot him and bury him in the same suit.' But that other motherfucker I can't figure him out. It's kind of hard to reconcile this with godliness and hot apple turnovers. Aye, Kressler? Yeah, the scary part is they put up such a good front. No, the scary part is is that it ain't no front. Nine millimeter. Bobby Burns' weapon of choice. (Kressler) So you think he's been here? I know he's been here. [church bells] You mind telling me what took you so long? - It's freezing out here. - Chief wanted his coat back. You didn't bring a cold-weather coat? What's the matter with you? Nothin' that a long overdue expense money wouldn't cure. Tell me. You got any new ideas about what we're dealing with? Like what? Come on, Kressler, open your eyes. These people aren't a ragtag bunch of yahoos that drink beer and run around in sheets on Saturday night. They got money behind them. They got strong pockets of community support. No proof. You don't know that for sure. The hell I don't. We just walked out of one. Who the fuck do you think called ahead and warned Gebhardt? They were standing on the fuckin' porch-- Excuse me! As one professional to another I would appreciate if you would minimize your constant use of profanity. - You're kidding. - No, sir, I'm not kidding. I'm telling you something's goin' on here. I'm telling you somethin' big is happenin' here and all that grabs you is my language? What the fuck is the matter with you? That's a good example. I'm a Christian, Beck. I'm sure that seems like a joke or something to you but I find your language personally offensive. If you need me for anything, I'll be at the Marriott in Oklahoma City until 9. My flight leaves at 10:05. I'd get a cold-weather coat if I were you. You could freeze to death in this weather. [truck horns] Excuse me? Uh, you-you mean because Western Union's computers are down I can't get my money? Well, can you tell me when they're gonna be back up? I don't fucking believe this. [thunder rumbling] Keep driving. 'You're gonna turn left at the street right here, okay'' [dramatic music] Who are you? You first. I'm the Grim Reaper. Now you. I'm a cop from LA. You're no cop from LA. I saw you in Arizona and now here in Oklahoma. Fuck it. It doesn't matter who you are...when you're dead. You know, before you kiss this world goodbye.. There is something you should know. (Reaper) 'You cops' 'judges, whatever the hell you are.' You keep thinking you can solve the problem by putting us in jail. Or killing us. That's what the Romans thought when they took the Christian people and they fed them to lions. That's what the Romans thought when they took the Christians and they put them into the sewers. Catacombs. It's the same thing today. Only catacombs have different names. Like San Quentin...and Soledad. And a 100 other prisons across this country. 'Cause you see...it didn't die in the sewers of Rome. It grew and grew. One idea. One cause. Every single prisoner's got it. And the Romans couldn't kill it and neither can kiss-ass liberals or cops. [thunder rumbling] Very easy. I'm right here. [tires screech] [instrumental music] [gunshot] [gunshots] [gunshots continue] This is 45 Adam. Officer needs assistance. [gunshots] Shit. [gunshots continue] 'Go. Go. Go.' Freeze! Arms away from your head! Don't shoot, don't shoot, I'm a cop. - Don't move! - I'm a cop, I'm a cop from LA. I got some ID. Right here. See? [police siren] (chief #2) 'One more thing.' I call a man back for an assignment. I don't wanna hear a 15-minute recitation on the phone. - To acomplish it. - Yes, sir. I got a tremendous amount of bullshit going on here. I don't need any additional tourists. But, Jerry, I like you. So I'm not gonna waltz you around. You're in big fuckin' trouble on this one. It's Agent Kressler, the asshole-- Oh, it's Agent Kressler, it's a PO named Webly. It's patrol officers from Kimble's murder who said that you acted in an insensitive manner. It is a goddamn Greek chorus of folks, Jerry. There are complaints of excessive drinking language unbecoming an officer, physical intimidation and kidnapping. I didn't kidnap anyone. I-- Oh, that's a beautiful rebuttal considering the list of charges. Chief, look, before you make any decisions you've gotta look at this stuff. This is the map that I told you about. Alright, here is the route. Right here. I got names and addresses of people. The-these are the letters. These are just some of the letters. Chief, there's something going on here. Something big is going on. More than anyone even guessed. This isn't a group of people who are standing around yelling nigger and kike and-and spic. This-this is a goddamn movement. They got organization. They got money. They got resources I wish the fuck we had. Jerry, Jerry, not now. Let's deal with first things first like keeping you on this case. To do that, I'm gonna need some help. Some ammunition only you can provide. I've set up an appointment with a Dr. Krantz one of those department psychiatrists. You convince him you're okay. You're on the next flight out. Four o'clock this afternoon. Don't be late and don't fuck it up. (announcer on intercom) 'Please call your office.' Mr. Beck? Dr. Krantz. - Pleased to meet you, doctor. - Come in. I know how stressful these things can be. So, um...just think of me as one of the guys. Did I say something funny, Mr. Beck? Uh, no. No, doc. It's just, uh.. ...this is-this is real important to me. It's also real important that you be completely honest here. Yes. Yes, I understand. I-I'm-I'm gonna be completely honest. Good. Then let's get back to my original question. Did I say something funny, Mr. Beck? Uh, look, can we-can we just drop it? We're not here to drop things, Mr. Beck. Okay. I mean, you're-you're a psychologist. You're trained and-and you understand these things. I mean, the rest of the world walks around with fragile egos. You're rambling, Mr. Beck. Well, the-the truth of the.. The truth is that you-you kind of look like Woody Allen. [Beck laughing] And when you said.. "...think of me as one of the guys." [Beck laughing] How did I...get to this? I don't know. It just happened. Just like this case. I didn't ask for it. It just happened. But it's okay, it's my case. I started it... and I just wanna finish it. [bell rings] Is there any point in-in going on with this? I mean. I'm a dead man. If that's true, Mr. Beck, you died by your own hand. It was the Woody Allen thing, right? No one responds well to ridicule, Mr. Beck. Even psychiatrists. God almighty. I swear to God to you, I didn't mean that as ridicule. Whatever else happens here today, that is the truth. I'm afraid our time is up, Mr. Beck. [music] We tried it your way, doc. - Now we're gonna try it mine. - 'Get out of this office.' You're not a safe man to put on the streets, Mr. Beck. You're not a safe man to put in this office, Dr. Krantz. If I get pulled off of this case because you look like Woody Allen I will not be responsible for what I will do. If you got some dues to pay there then by God, you pay them because I will not. I will fixate on you as the instrument of my destruction. And you will never feel safe in your world again. [children talking and laughing] [airplane engine revving] [phone ringing] Yeah. I'll hold. [clearing throat] Morning, captain. Oh, yeah. It's a wonder what a good night's sleep will do for you. I did? [guitar music] Son of a bitch. No, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Thank you. [guitars and drums] Woody fuckin' Allen. (male #11) 'Jerry Beck?' Yeah, hi. Is Captain Dixon with you? You're looking at him. - No shit? - No shit. (Beck) 'You know the Selby place?' (Dixon) 'I know the place and the man.' 'Arlen Selby is a major Klucker in these parts.' (Beck) 'We're gonna need men for backup' 'and it only takes one with mixed loyalties.' (Dixon) 'I think I can guarantee that won't happen.' 'Meet seven of Kelman's finest. Gentlemen, Jerry Beck.' - Mr. Beck. - Not a klucker among 'em. I feel better already. - Is this your boy? - Yeah. - Hi there. - Hi. (Dixon) 'You must be a pretty important guy.' Got a fellow who flew in this afternoon because you're here. Curtis, we got some business to do. I'm glad you could make it, Beck. Yeah. Thanks for all the help. Sorry, Kressler, me and the doc we got along just like that. - Two peas in a pod. - Really? What did you do? Threaten his wife and kids? (Dixon) I see you two guys are already acquainted. What do you say we take care of some business over here, Beck? According to my information I think it's best that we're in position no later than 5:45, right here. (Dixon) 'Why do I get the feeling you got something on your mind'' You tell me. Well, I sense you've got some unfinished business wrapped up in this and it worries me. So I made some calls. I like to know who I'm working with. I got a wife and kids waiting. So does Franklin. I make it a point to go home. You can call LA or anywhere they've got a phone. But it's bullshit and you know it. 'There's only one question about me that matters.' And that is, is there anyone that'd be afraid to go through a door with me? You already know the answer to that question. Otherwise, you wouldn't be here in the first place. - It's not quite that simple. - The hell it isn't. That's what's so great about this job, captain. It's as simple as it gets. Death and taxes. [intense music] [music continues] - Let's do it. - Let's go. [music continues] [music continues] [police siren] [music continues] This is the FBI. - Freeze. - Nobody move. - Get down. - 'Down on the floor.' Keep your hands where I can see 'em. 'This is the FBI.' Ladies, outside, move, move. Let's go. Get down. Get down, Mrs. Gebhardt. Get down. 'We have a warrant for the arrest of Robert Bobby Burns' 'and three John Does.' 'We have reason to believe they're on the premises.' - Alright, alright. - Get on the floor. I repeat. This is the FBI. 'Comply with this federal warrant' 'and put down your arms immediately.' I didn't expect to find you here, Reverend. Nor I you, Mr. Beck. - You out spreading the gospel? - In a manner of speaking. Well, spread this gospel. You tell your men out front to throw down their weapons and comply with the federal warrant. Now. This is Reverend Gebhardt. I want your full attention. 'This is not the time or the place' 'for an armed confrontation.' 'We have nothing to hide.' I want you to lay down your weapons. 'I repeat. Lay down your weapons.' [gate opens] (Kressler) 'Beck, I'm through playing catch-up with you.' 'You've been hiding evidence from me.' 'Whatever happens here today, I want it.' Hands on your heads. Against the wall. Move. [intense music] [music continues] Ah. (Reverend) Alright, Mr. Kressler. We have complied with your wishes. Now kindly comply with ours. Please leave. Beck, apparently you were wrong. He's not here after all. What do you suggest now? We set up our shop in one of the barracks over there, huh? I told you, I get the evidence, win or lose. Look, he's not in the church. He's not in the main house. He's not in the kitchen or in the storage area. I looked places you couldn't hide a kid, no less four adults. [birds chirping] He's gotta be here. Jerry, I don't think he's here. This is the place. It's all in place. Like in the letters. The meeting to create a new covenant, the-the map said.. Jerry, I gotta.. ...he was gonna be in Oklahoma City. He was in fuckin' Oklahoma City and he's gotta be here. Look, if that head Nazi makes a call, my ass is grass. Damn it, all the roads lead to this place. Look, it's time to walk away. I backed you as much as I can on this. [intense music] (Reverend) 'This is an outrage. A violation of constitutional law.' I demand legal counsel before you take another step in church. (Kressler) Are you finished? (Reverend) Leave these premises or face a multi-million-dollar lawsuit. Go ahead because I'm already broke. My goddamn ex-wife beat you to it. Come on, let's go. (Reverend) 'Is the FBI broke, Mr. Kressler?' (Kressler) 'Look, just give me five minutes and I'll settle everything.' You're out of here, Beck. You hear me? You are history, mister. Do you hear me? Yeah, I heard you. Now stay the fuck out of my way. Your unprofessional behavior is jeopardizing all our careers. (Kressler) 'I'm talking to you, mister.' [Kressler screaming] You are off this case! No such luck, dickface. You wanna do it right now? You wanna go right now? I don't know what going on between you two. (Dixon) 'Settle this somewhere. This is not the time or the place.' - 'This operation is over.' - 'Just back off.' [intense music] [door creaks] [dramatic music] Shit. (Kressler on megaphone) 'This is the FBI.' 'We have a federal warrant for the arrest' 'of Robert Bobby Burns and three John Doe accomplices'' 'You're completely surrounded. Surrender immediately.' [intense music] [gunshots] (Beck) He's dead. [music continues] Alright. We gotta split up. Franklin. Kressler. John. [gunshots] (male #12) Die, nigger. Put some pressure on it. [footsteps] [gunshots] [gunshots continue] Let's go. I'm okay. Take him. [music continues] [gun cocks] [gunshots] Five, six. [wood creaks] [gun cocks] It's you. Jesus Christ. Why are you doing this to me? You killed a cop in LA. I didn't kill a cop. The hell you didn't. [gasping] Don't lie to me, asshole. You're dying. Don't lie to me. Give it up, Bobby. I don't know what you're talking about. You robbed that store and then you shot the manager. And then when the cop pulled you over to question you you shot him right in the face. You pumped a dozen rounds of 9 mm right in his goddamn face! Didn't you, you son of a bitch? You got the wrong guy. You got the wrong guy. You shot the wrong guy. You've been following this guy for 1500 miles, he didn't do it. You don't know that. How do you know that? The same way you do. I heard him say it. And whether you like it or not, it's true. [dramatic music] John. You killed him. You killed my brother. John, I-I didn't want it to go down like-- I didn't even get a chance to tell him. I drove up from New Mexico last night and he was asleep. Now he'll never know what I did. 'He'll never know I had it too.' I had the same blood that he did. Fire and ice. 'He loved me.' 'He would have-he would have killed for me.' But he didn't think I had it. So I got a Browning just like his and I went into that store and I shot that nigger. And I shot your fucking cop too on the way home. He came up to me. I looked him straight in the eyes. And I smiled and I said, "Merry Christmas, officer." I had that motherfucker dead bang and I blew him away. I put a bullet in him for every time some cop 'fucked with my brother since he was 14 years old.' Now, you put your gun down. Put it down. 'I wanna see your gun on the floor.' I'll blow your fucking brains out, faggot. [thud] Alright. Alright, now you. Okay. Okay, John. John, first.. First, I think you ought to know the truth. Just listen to me. I think you ought to know the truth about what happened here. I didn't kill your brother, John. He did. [gunshots] John, give it up, man. John. John, forget all that fire-and-ice bullshit. Your brother was a pussy without a Browning in his hand. And he was a fucking punk, in the joint. 'He'd bend over for a pack of cigarettes.' He sucked every con in the joint, John. Shut up! Shut up! [water dripping] [panting] I don't have anything to say to you. You gave up your gun. You did what no cop should ever do. He was gonna kill me if I didn't. He was gonna kill us both anyway. Who are you to talk? You told him I killed his brother. If it was up to you, I'd be dead right now. It was up to me. I'm pleased to say that this case is a model example of how the FBI and local law enforcement cannot only work together, but achieve significant results together. In reviewing the letters, Burn's phone book and other evidence 'supplied by Agent Kressler' 'bureau is revising its position' 'on white supremacy groups.' There is sufficient evidence to believe that there is a concerted effort 'to combine these groups under a common umbrella.' 'And so the FBI is forming a task force' 'to respond to this.' And now, I would like to introduce the agent who has been on this case from beginning to end Arthur Kressler. Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you. There's not much I can add. I would, however, like to thank the bureau 'for its unwavering support' 'and commitment to this operation.' And also a big clap on the back to local law enforcement. They were with us every step of the way. 'Without them, we probably wouldn't be here now.' Taxi? How's your leg? It hurts like a bitch. What do you think? Thanks for the lift. Jerry. I want you to know that I'd go through a door with you anytime. And...there's more out there than death and taxes. A hell of a lot more. All you gotta do is give it half the chance.
