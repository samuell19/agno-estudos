By early tomorrow morning, the President, Mr. Herbert Hoover, will be in receipt of a letter from me, predicting... CARLOTTA: I was W.C. Fields' mistress for many years. And although I hoped for more, somehow or other, things never changed. He was born in Philadelphia sometime in the early 1880s. No one is sure of the exact date, because he changed it all the time. He was a great comedian. Whether he was a great man, I don't know, unless greatness means possessing every single blessing and curse known to mankind. Something in his early life made him that way. because all I know of the early years was what he told me. Today, in one shattering blast, this American's booze supply was completely obliterated. How long will it be, then, before this nation runs out of one of its most precious treasures, the American alcoholic? (DOG BARKING) (BOTTLE CLATTERING) Hey, it's gin. MAN: Get the lights on, please. Half a minute to rehearsal. MAN: Come on, props. Get the goddamn dentist's chair to right, will ya? All right, come on. Everybody on their marks. All right. WOMAN: Oh, Doctor. Ah, yes, mother and child. A picture of perpetual beauty. Please relieve the lady of the little nipper and I shall proceed into my palace of pain. (MOANING) Yes. Yes. Well, we'll have to look into that. This way, please. There you are, make yourself comfortable. Easy does it. Don't damage anything. Yes. My, my, what a mammoth pair of roots. Might as well tighten your faucets while we're at it. (CLICKING TONGUE RHYTHMICALLY) (BABY GURGLING) Oh, yes, what a robust little rascal! Oh, look how he sucks his cow juice. Oh! (MUTTERING) MAN: Fields. What? Come up here. I want to see you. I'll be up in a minute. That's for hitting me too hard. It was only a rehearsal, you idiot. Well, I'm sorry. I just got carried away. That's 'cause I beat you at pinochle. It took you six months to beat me. That's because you cheat. I am not a cheat. I'll tell you something else. Yeah? You're the type that makes it tough for all midgets. I am not a midget. I am a little person. Well, they're the worst kind. Melody! Go change your clothes, I want to go get a drink. What the hell goes on between you two, anyway? Where've you been? Ziegfeld's been on my neck all day. Are you my agent or aren't you? I've been at the Winter Garden with Al Jolson. He was sick all day, throwing up in his dressing room john. Well, I've been goddamn sick over here. Look. I know you're upset about the sketch, Flo, I was just trying to milk it for a few laughs. Mr. Ziegfeld thinks the new jokes are too bawdy. I merely want the sketch played as written, not as rewritten by you. But we played it as written last night and it bombed. That's why I added the jokes. Johnny's been watching rehearsal and so have I. He feels the same way. I do, Bill. I do. Now, look, Bill, I'm no goddamn prude. I've got bare breasted women on my stage. But I don't tighten their nipples with a wrench. Oh, come on, Flo, be reasonable. I am reasonable. Look, gentlemen. Gentlemen, you're both reasonable. And this thing can be resolved. Fields will play the sketch as written. That's how it'll be resolved. After all, he's playing in my theater. Okay, Flo. Okay. You're right. It's your theater. We'll play it the way you want it. Melody, are you ready? MELODY: I need a couple of minutes. I lost an earring. Well, hurry up. I got to meet Harold Parker in the restaurant. HAROLD: It's a six-story apartment house and stores going up in the finest section of town. This bathtub gin would kill a horse. Go ahead, Harold. Ed Wynn and Fanny Brice are in the deal already. Yeah? Anything you say, Harold. You know that. Listen, I have to tell you something. I don't know why it is, you see, but it's always difficult for me to tell you how grateful I am for everything you've done for me. I can't believe that I'm sitting here, buying a piece of an apartment building. Oh, Bill. I couldn't find the damn earring, I don't know what the hell happened to it. Hello, Harold. Why don't you sit down? Nothing goes on. By the way, my birthday is on Thursday. Happy Birthday. Listen, I'm gonna put some new sight gags in tonight when I get that dame in the dentist chair. Well, I hope they're in good taste. If you're wondering what to get me for my birthday, get me gold earrings, real gold. Good taste. I know good taste from bad. I've been doing comedy for 25 years. I've got a vault full of stocks and bonds. And a potassium mine. Maybe you should give me stock instead of the earrings. Did you say potassium? Don't sneer at potassium. You didn't have potassium in your body, your ass would fall off. I gotta go. Give me the check. Thank you very much. Don't forget to send me the papers on the building. Gee, I been thinking about Jolson being sick in his dressing room. Well, that's very nice of you, Bill, but you don't have to worry about him. But if he's got a john in his dressing room, why the hell don't I? FIELDS: I think we'll tighten her faucets while we're at it. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Yes. (CLICKING TONGUE) FIELDS: Yes, put your head back, please. Now, open your mouth wide. (SCREAMING) My, my, what a cavity. Do you think you can fill it, Doctor? I hope I'm man enough. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Now, let us assume a position that allows me to do my best work. Would you slide down a little please? Sure. A little more. Okay. Oh, I'm afraid I just don't know where to place my legs. Well, try putting them up there. Have you got it? I sure have. Oh, good. Ah, yes. Now, you hold that position until I call the dentist. 'Cause I'm just the plumber that came here to fix the sink. (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) ZIEGFELD: Fields! Goddamn you! Fields! (BANGING AT DOOR) I want to talk to you! That dentist sketch was a goddamned disgrace. Disgrace, hell! I finally got a couple of laughs. There's just no excuse for it. To me, it was just plain dirty. I'll tell you what it means to be dirty. To stand up on a stage and not get any laughs, that's being dirty. It makes me feel filthy inside, like a fraud, like a fake. Like everybody's saying that W.C. Fields is a no talent bum, who's up there stealing his money. Well, to me that's not only dirty, it's immoral. Bill, you double-cross me once more and you're through. I'm through right now! What the hell! I can go to California They wouldn't touch you in pictures with a 10-foot pole. If they've got Chaplin, what the hell do they need with you? (AUDIENCE APPLAUD) I just met with them this morning. Ziegfeld wants to call off the feud. He wants to apologize for what he said. He did ask if you could just clean it up a little bit for matinees. Matinees or evenings, that's the way it stays. Mr. Fields, may I help you today, sir? Yeah. I'd like to look at a pair of gold earrings. There's no music known to man's ear that compares to the pussycat purr of a woman that's gotten what she wanted. Happy birthday, my love. MAN: (KNOCKS) Five minutes, Mr. Fields. I gotta say it. Say it, my hummingbird. I just absolutely gotta say it. Spit it out, ladybug. Gold is really gold. Yes. What a wonderful way you have with words. (CHUCKLES) (DOORBELL BUZZES) Who is it? Mr. Schaeffer. Come in. Well, where was she last night? When she left you, she took a taxi to 97th Street. 116 East. The Hungarian. Right. What time did she leave? Well, I left at 6 a.m. She still hadn't come out. Is it possible you might've missed her? Funny... How all you guys ask the same thing. CARLOTTA: Fields was never very lucky with women. Along with dogs, babies and politicians, he felt women were put on this Earth just to strike a blow at Fields. When the blow came, it became sacred duty to strike back. My, my! Look what he's giving you for your birthday. Get out of here! You're a two-timing little broad. (IN HUNGARIAN ACCENT) Do not talk like this to the woman I respect. If you had so much respect for her, why didn't you take off your roller skates? You've been spying on me. Exactly. We tried to resist each other, but we couldn't. I kinda got that idea when I saw the two of you on the cot. Now, gimme back the earrings. I won't. And no gentleman ever asks for a present back. You're right. And I'll tell you what your idea of a gentleman is! It's someone that you can double-cross, screw, tattoo and make a horse's ass off! Well, to me that's no gentleman, that's a horse's ass! Now, either you give me back the earrings, or I'm gonna tell your lover here, how you gave me a social disease! Excuse me. What it means, ah, social disease? I don't know the Hungarian word for "clap." (AUDIENCE LAUGHING LOUDLY) You shouldn't be inside in the first place, you should be at your post in the car, waiting, in case I choose to leave early. Yes, sir. Funny, Mr. Fields, the last time you got sick in a movie, it was a Charlie Chaplin picture, too. Are you daring to imply professions jealousy? No, Mr. Fields. No, indeed. Well, watch it, Leon. Mr. Fields. What? Oh, yes? Leaving early? Ah, ah, well, not really. What happened was, inside, you see, I got the pains in the stomach and then I... I got sick. I think it was from eating bad clams, Pismos. Ever play on a vaudeville bill with Chaplin? Ah, yes. I was a, ah... star at the London Palladium when Charles Chaplin was a chorus boy. As a matter of fact, as I recall, he was a... Toe dancer. (CHUCKLING) (CAR HONKING) Excuse me. You got me into that. (DOORBELL BUZZING) Ah, good morning, Mr. Dockstedter. Bill. It's conditioned me to take that extra quart of gin a day. I can't stop now. I got three-quarters of a mile to go. You don't stop in the middle of the Brooklyn Bridge. (STERNLY) Will you stop and listen to me a minute? Sure. You want to get me the towel? What's wrong? Everything. You mean, Ziegfeld doesn't want me for his new show? (SIGHS) It's much worse than that. What can be worse than that? Harold Parker died last night. No. Oh. He just, uh... He just died last night. His wife found him. Oh, God. Bill... Bill, listen to me. You're, uh... Your investments. What about my investments? (SHOUTING) What the hell about my investments? Well, it's still only a rumor, but if it's true, they're, uh... Everything is down the drain. Has been for a long time. He's been covering it up. What are you talking about? Some woman. He had a woman some place. She's bleeding him. Taking him for everything he had. I don't believe it. I don't believe that. Down the drain? Oh, Jesus. God. (AGGRESSIVELY) What're you trying to tell me? That I'm broke? I'm busted? Unless you have something stashed... What do you mean, stashed? I gave him every cent I had! I cashed in every asset to put in that new build thing! Then I'm sorry. Well, what happened? How'd he die? He just dropped dead. Had a heart attack. Dropped dead. Wouldn't you know it. The son of a bitch took the easy way out. Hollywood. Hollywood, California. That's where we should be. I mean, vaudeville's almost dead here. We're in the middle of a depression. Let's try our luck in Hollywood. That's the new land of opportunity. For me? Now listen to me. Listen. You want to play babies all your life? Wouldn't you like to play a lead? Ridiculous. How tall do you think Valentino was? How tall? Four-foot, one. I don't believe it. On my life. You're a liar. They stand him on a box. I'm only three-foot, six. So we'll use two boxes. (SCOFFS) Ludwig, please. I need your friendship. What you really need is my money. That's not true. Ludwig, listen to me. I'm broke, I'm busted and I'm desperate. You got to stake me to Hollywood. You'll never regret it. Look. You could buy a second-hand car here and we could sell it there. It wouldn't cost a dime. You'd never regret it. If I didn't make it as an actor, I know I'd make it as a script writer. Close that damn thing, I don't want to get wet. Just a warm summer rain, Ludwig. Can't hurt you. I don't want to catch cold. Only time I sleep like a baby is when it rains. I like to hear it on the roof. I loved it in London. I loved it in Paris. But best of all, I loved it as a boy in Philadelphia. Cleared away the horseshit. (TIRE EXPLODES) (THUNDER RUMBLING) Look at that. Look at that. The trees are full of oranges. I saw them. The only thing you really looked at the whole trip was women's bazooms. Ridiculous. I don't need to look at an orange tree. If they had tits on 'em, you'd look at them. (HONKING) FIELDS: Ludwig. What the hell are you doing? Why do you always keep me waiting? I can't help it if my hat blew off. Come on. Come on. (GROWLING) Go on. Go. Go on. Get out of here. I hate ya. Must still carry the scent of hobo. Dogs smell it every time. Come on. (MEN SPEAKING IN GERMAN) LUDWIG: His wife passed away last summer. FIELDS: Oh. And he says this place has become too much for him. Besides the museum, he leases the ring toss stand next door. For 600, we can take over the lease. And he says it does a very good business. Yeah? Can we look at his books? (LUDWIG TALKING INDISTINCTLY) (DOORBELL BUZZES) Ah, come on in, folks, and hobnob with some of the world's most famous personages. Take all the time you want. Start in aisle one. I suggest you start with Hiawatha. Is Pocahontas here, too? Ah, be back at 11. She went out for coffee. FIELDS: ♪ By the sea, by the sea ♪ By the beautiful sea ♪ You and I, you and I ♪ Oh, how happy we'll be ♪ By the sea, by the sea ♪ By the beautiful sea ♪ You and I, you and I ♪ Oh, how happy we'll be ♪ Yeah, by the sea, oh, how happy we'll be ♪ By the sea ♪ (EXCLAIMING) (TYPING) Type. Type. Type. Type. Type. Don't you ever sleep? Yeah. But I want to have this one finished by morning. Any luck on the scripts you've already sent in? Not yet. But this one's about a bank dick. It's a sure sale. They were all a sure sale. Thanks, you little bastard. Always discouraging me. Peckerhead. (BELL RINGS) I suppose you like the script, Mr. Bannerman, otherwise you wouldn't have sent for me. I think it's quite funny. Well, I got some more here, if you like 'em. You know... Uh, look, Mr. Bannerman, ah... Harry, all right? Sure. Harry. (CHUCKLING) That's very good. Ah, look, Harry, I... I don't want a fortune for the scripts. You know, I'll just take a few hundred dollars. I mean, if you don't like the scripts, at all, it's... It's all right with me. What I'm trying to say is I'll do anything to get into films. Assist a director, move scenery, I'll hammer nails if you like. I've got a part for you in a picture. A part? A part. Acting. Ah, my salary's $5,000 a week. A minute ago, you were pleading with me for a few hundred dollars for a script. You see, in vaudeville, I got $5,000 a week. You just told me you were busted, broke. Oh, well, that's true. But if I get any less than $5,000, you see, that'd shatter my self-confidence. And, well, I mean, confidence is twice as important to a man who's on the skids. What the hell right have you got to hold me up? Well, what right have you got to capitalize on my misfortune? $2,500 a week, and that's my top. How much? 2,500. How much? 2,500. I'll take it. By the way, they tell me you're impossible to handle. Ah, that's nothing but a nasty rumor. Oh! If I have to rewrite my part, that'll be $500 extra. What I'm trying to say, Ludwig, is that it's, ah... The kind of part that'll lead to other parts, you know. I wish you'd come with me. Listen. I'll have all the money we'll need. I'll, ah... I'll stay here and run the museum. Since I was a little boy I loved the ocean. Yeah. Well, anytime, Ludwig. Yeah. Come here. Now, you listen to me. You be careful, if you go near the water without me. Yeah. And don't swim out too far. No. A goddamn raindrop would drown you. My name's W.C. Fields. I was told to report here to stage...10. Uh-huh. Yeah. Okay. But you're the first one. The crew ain't even here yet. I like to be early. Stage 10. Straight back, on your left. Thank you. CARLOTTA: When I met W.C. Fields, he was already a movie star. I was working as an extra, along with a dozen other girls, Although he passed me every day, he never even looked at me. And when I finally got his attention, at a party when the picture was finished, he insulted me. ♪ Little China boy will be with you soon ♪ When you're in his arms beneath the moon ♪ Sing a little low-down, sing a little low-down, sing a little low-down tune ♪ Sing a little low-down, sing a little low-down ♪ Sing a little low-down tune ♪ (CROWD APPLAUDS) MAN: Speech. Speech. Thought you'd never ask. Now, I've finished my latest epic for Mr. Harry Bannerman and this, ah, great studio. And ah, these three off-key Chinese cumquats (PEOPLE LAUGHING) bring to mind to me the, ah... international character of Hollywood films. For instance, I am directed by the great Gregory La Cava. (PEOPLE APPLAUDING) Down. Down. I don't know why you're applauding. He's a guinea director who's done his best to ruin my entire career. And written for by Gene Fowler. This mick can write obscenities in 11 different languages. Thank you, Gene. I have among my friends, I'm proud to say, the great Barrymore. The melancholy Dane who doubles as my spiritual advisor and... (MIMICS CORK POPPING) Bartender. Also, a friend of mine, the very famous Hebrew restaurateur, Mr. David Chasen, who so graciously supplied the alleged refreshments. (CROWD APPLAUDS) Now, to my dearly beloved public, I can only say I hope they go see the picture. And, ah... I'd rather be here than in Philadelphia. (CROWD LAUGHING) Thank you. If Mr. Fields was so struck by my talent, how come he called me an off-key Chinese cumquat? (LAUGHS) Ah, he just said that to get a laugh. Look, you must've been attractive to him, or he wouldn't have invited you out to his home. But I thought you said he had a part for me in his new movie. Well, I'm quite sure he does. But not positively sure? You know, I worked with him for three days on the set as an extra, and he never even said hello to me. I must tell you something, Mr. Dockstedter, that I have no interest in Mr. Fields at all, except for my career. I mean, he's old enough to be my father. Look, why don't you just give yourself a chance to get to know him? Well, is there a part or isn't there? Yes. There is a part. That's the way. That's the boy. Atta boy, Bill. (MAN EXCLAIMS) Oh, get it, Bill. Forget your hand, hit it with your nose. (CAR HONKING) Ah, yes, a bit of loveliness has arrived. I shall greet the lady and return posthaste. I shall assist in greeting her. Rise up one more inch and I'll step on your Adam's apple. You need me to add a bit of class to the proceedings. Otherwise, your crudeness will definitely scare the poor wench off. Delighted to meet you, my dear. May I present the great Barrymore. Thank you. Enchanted, my dear. You know what, Charles, I think the best thing to do is to take this delightful lady up and let her look at the old homestead while I finish my set. Oh, I'd love to do that, Bill, but I'm due somewhere else right now. Ah, save dinner for me later, though, will you? I'll do that. Having absolutely no inclination toward competitive sports, I'm entirely at your disposal. Better watch him. He's a white slaver. You'll wind up in a Chinese cat house. That's the god damnest thing I ever saw. What the hell are you laughing at? A little old woman in Pasadena makes these up for 66 bucks a copy. (GASPING) I couldn't wait till I tried mine on. Men in dames corsets. Not dames corsets, a man muscle retainer. Bullshit. You know what? I think both of you are fruits. (WHISTLES) Fresh. How dare any of you accuse Fields and me of fagotry? When in concert, he and I have laid more pipeline than any of you, louts put together. You've got to be sober to be able to screw. When was the last time you and Fields were sober? Jumping jofferds! I forgot my lady guest. Hmm, ask her in and we'll split a bar of soap together. (MEN LAUGH) Comfortable, young lady? I'll be with you in a few minutes. I got some business with the boys. Oh, oh, listen. Ah, there's three servants up to the house, get one of the lazy bastards to fix you a snack. I've already had lunch, thank you. Okay. FIELDS: Gerald. Matilda. Cleanup time. BARRYMORE: So this sardine says to me, "Jack, in the company of Romeo and Juliet, "does Romeo have an affair with Juliet?" I said, "They did in my company, I played Romeo." Excuse me, Mr. Fields, but... Ah, yes, ah, look, ah... Excuse me for not spending more time with you, my dear, but Sundays are a madhouse around here. Well, if you prefer, I can come back tomorrow. Oh, no, no, no, no. You stay, 'cause after I finish this hand, I'll give you my, ah... Undivided attention. (MEN MURMURING) The boys are gonna stay for dinner, so fix something for six. But it's seven o'clock, Mr. Fields. We're supposed to be out of here by five on Sundays. How the hell would you like to be out of here for good? Leon! Now, go on, go on, do as I told you! I've taken enough abuse from you ingrates. You've rooked and robbed me beyond conscience and mercy. We've never touched a damn thing. Well, if that's the truth, who drinks up my booze? You do, Mr. Fields. Yeah? Do you cook, Miss, ah... Monti. Well, do you cook? Well, I... Well, do you or don't you? Oh, never mind. Listen, Leon, I'll tell you what you do, you take Miss Monti into the kitchen and you show her where everything is. But it's after five. You, too? I don't believe it. I don't believe it. Here's a man I have such affection for. Imported him from New York. In fact, I'm leaving a big chunk of my money to colored orphans because of him. I want to tell you something, Leon. If you're gonna be ungrateful, there are lots of orphans of other colors to go around. Well, it's still after five. That does it. You're canned. You're canned along with these other two. Have we got enough eggs in the kitchen? You just canned me. I'll tell you what you do, you make an omelet, make it for six. Oh, never mind, make it for seven. Have some yourself. Please, lady. Please. I want you two out of here tomorrow morning! Not you, Leon. If I find my Jack Daniels one inch below his mustache, neither one of you gets paid. Good evening, my dear. Hate to distract you from your labors, but Fields can no longer succeed in keeping us apart. And as the words of the great Shakespeare once said, "When passion can no longer be bottled up, have out with it." (UNZIPPING) (SCREAMS) "Have out with it." Steady, my dear. Don't be so coy, my precious. I merely wish to introduce you to Richard the Third. So named because he is a three-piece set. Ah, I knew I'd find you here, you reprobate. My God! Put that thing away. Why? Is it that small? Come on. Come on, get the hell out of the kitchen. (ZIPPING) I merely wished to screw her. The only thing you're screwing up is the omelet. (SINGING) (LAUGHS) (SLOW RHYTHMIC TAPPING) (FIELDS LAUGHING) Oh, God. What a bunch! I just rolled the last one down the hill. Did I thank you for the omelet? No. Well, thank you. I guess I'll stay up the rest of the night. I'm an insomniac. Only sleep in the rainy season. (SIGHS) Did you know that about me? (SIGHS) Could we please talk about the part now, Mr. Fields.? What part? The part in your new picture. Who told you there was a part? Your agent. My agent had no goddamn right to tell you that! Then what am I doing here? I don't know. I thought we were gonna spend a pleasant Sunday together. Simply get to know each other. But obviously you're only interested in a part. What the hell's the matter with that? I happen to have an ambition to be an actress. Of course you do. All you silly dames are desperate to be an actress. It's an excuse for ducking honest work. Instead of being a sales girl or a waitress. Let me ask you something. Did you ever get a part? I mean, a decent part? What the hell! Doesn't that tell you something? (PLATE SHATTERS) I don't believe it. You know how much that goddamn plate cost? I don't care how much it cost! I sat around here like an idiot all day, waiting to talk to you about a part. You completely ignored me until you wanted someone to cook your dinner! I am sick and tired of either getting attacked in offices, or being brushed off by some so-called hotshot like you! And you know something? It's really rotten of you to say I have no talent when you haven't even seen my work. Just because you're on top, you think you're God? What the hell do you care if I'm losing my car, being kicked out of my room? Well, how have you lived so far? Off of men, getting little gifts here and there? That's a terrible thing to say! I was raised a good Catholic! I thought you were Chinese. Runnin' around in that silly outfit, singin' that ridiculous goddamn Chinese song. Oh, sure. Make fun of me now. What the hell do you know about the world, living up here in this big house? What do you know about people? What the hell are you, a Communist? Hell, no. I'm anticommunist, you know. I don't give a damn what you are! What do you want to do, come in here and take away my house? Right now, I don't care, either way! How'd you like to be living here, in this house? I mean, how'd you like to live here, with me? You've got to be kidding. I'm not kidding. I don't believe this. Well, of course, you'd have, ah, certain duties. What kind of duties? Ah... (STUTTERING) Do you type? Yeah, I type. Very good. Good. Well... Come live here, then. Live here as what? Your secretary or your mistress? Well, ideally one shouldn't exclude the other. Well? You're the one that said you didn't want to lose your room or your car. Move in. You're lonely, aren't you? Who the hell isn't lonely? Including me. Between us, you and me, ah... You're not suggesting some sort of, ah, arrangement, are you? Oh! (CHUCKLES) I see. No, you don't have to worry about me chasing you around. At my age, if a woman says no to me, I thank her profusely. (SIGHS) My typing's pretty sloppy. How do you keep your room? Not as sloppy as my typing. Well, it's a big house. Move in. Oh, Godfrey Daniels. Good morning, Chinaman. Good morning. Ready to go to work? Well, a little stiff from all the moving the last three days, but okay. Seen Leon? Let's go. We can't be late 'cause they shoot movies on a strict schedule. (BIRD SQUAWKING) There he is. That Nelson Eddy swan's eaten my goldfish again! I'll brain him. Get out of there! I'll break your rump. Beat it. Get out of here. Go on. Get out. Go. Go. Go. Go on, now. Get out of here. I'll crown you. I ought to take a shotgun and shoot you. You're right. I should shoot Nelson Eddy. Go on. Get out, get out of here. Get out of here. I'll make him a soprano. Get out of here. Go home. Go on. Get out of here. FIELDS: Get out the steno pad. Right here. Yeah. That's my poison pen letters. I send them to rogues and rascals in high places. My pet peeve is Eleanor Roosevelt, the Internal Revenue Service and all religious institutions. Religious institutions? I was raised in a convent. Maybe that's where you went wrong. Have you ever read the Bible? It's beautiful. Only for loopholes. (VEHICLE HONKS) What are you trying to do, Leon? You trying to kill me or something? Sorry, Mr. Fields. I wonder. MAN 1: All right. Picture now. Places, everybody. Lights. MAN 2: On your mark, people. And quickly. And stay there. Take the positions you had before. MAN 1: Quickly. Quickly. Come on. Are you ready, Mr. Fields? Yeah. I've been ready for a half an hour. (BELL RINGS) Roll 'em! Action. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I'm here to introduce you to, ah... I'm going to introduce you... Uh, dammit. Cut. What the hell's the name of the tonic, anyway? Dr. McGonigle's Tonic. Hold your positions, people. We're going right away. Yeah, just settle. Just settle down. We're going right away. (BELL RINGS) Oh, it's like blood to a vampire. MAN 1: All right, let's roll 'em. MAN 2: And action. (CHUCKLES) Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I'm here to introduce you to Dr. McGonigle's Tonic. Now this tonic is made entirely of pure herbs and roots. With a splash of floor polish to put shine in your eye. (CHUCKLES) Get away, kid, you both... Where the hell's the kid? He's on the left, Bill. He's on the what? Oh! There he is. I'm sorry about that. Really, Greg. It's just human error. Get away, kid. You bother me. Now, if you'll be good enough to take the quarters out of your pockets, whilst I pass amongst you with Dr. McGonigle's magical miracle formula. Oh, yes! Oh, madam. Oh, yes. I shant rest until I've put a bottle of my tonic on the top of your shelf. Oh, wonderful. As I was saying, as I... As I was saying... Steady there. What the hell was I saying? LA CAVA: Cut. Ah, Chinaman. Chinaman. (TELEPHONE RINGING) Let me see the script. Gimme my glasses. Stage Four. Just answer me with yes or no if he's standing close by. Why is everything going so goddamned slow? Is he forgetting his lines again? ASSISTANT: Yes, sir. Is he drinking? Yes. Any heavier than usual? Answer yes or no. Yes, sir. Well, we're falling behind schedule. You do the best you can. I guess I'm gonna have to have a talk with him. CARLOTTA: Harry Bannerman tried to talk to him, but nobody could talk to Fields. And if it was about his drinking, he could become very abusive. Fields was a world of contradictions. For a selfish man, he was very generous. For a prejudiced man, he was very understanding. And I must say, he was very brave for a coward. When I asked myself why I continued to be with him, I had no answer. Maybe it was because I was frightened of being anywhere else. Or maybe part of me hoped he could someday, help my career. Or maybe, and most amazing of all, I was starting to care for him. Thank you, my dear. Sometimes I get down here too late and then they're out of fish cake sandwiches. Skol. Skol. Well, I think we got about the last of them. Ah. I often sit here watching the passing parade. The princes, the paupers. Cowboys that never rode a horse. Movie stars that never made a movie. Sometimes I'm really sure it's gonna happen for me. And sometimes I don't know. I know I have the talent, but I don't think I always have the push it takes. Well, you certainly had enough push the day you came to my house. Yeah. But it comes and goes in spurts. I can be very lazy sometimes. How did it happen for you? Well, I mean, life dealt me some low blows. I think the lowest blow it ever dealt me was being raised in Philadelphia. Oh. I didn't know your parents were from Philadelphia. I never had any parents, I wasn't born, I was fermented. I think a baby's better off not having parents. You don't really mean that. Why do you always act like... A son of a bitch? You said it. I wouldn't take 10 sweet guys for one son of a bitch. Because if there's ever any changes in this world, it's the son of bitches that do it. The sweet guys never change a goddamned thing. They're too smug. They're too busy being sweet. That's why I like to go around and stick pins in their balloons and let the air out of the self-satisfied bastards. MAN: Ah, we're from the IRS, Mr. Fields. Since you didn't come down to us, we decided to come here. Among other things, Mr. Fields, you have listed here a one thousand dollar deduction, for a "home for Peruvian bastards." Why? Well, that's because I gave to the Brazilian bastards last year. So I figured it was the Peruvian bastards' turn this time. We cannot find such a charity listed, Mr. Fields. Well, if you had a home for Peruvian bastards, would you advertise it? You took a deduction for 32 cases of gin and whiskey. That's right. And I drank every drop of it. I'll not be accused of dishonesty. Why is it a business deduction? Because I'm a comedian, and when I drink, I'm funny. Root beer's cheaper, but I don't get half the laughs. I must warn you, Mr. Fields, some of this return could be viewed as fraudulent. Well, don't speak to me of fraud, sir, when you represent one of the most fraudulent and corrupt political systems since the Roman Empire. I'm far from being a communist. But you serve an administration that bleeds us poor suckers white while senators get rich. You serve a President that has a Scotty dog that eats better than 90% of the children in the United States. You serve a President who's got a wife who flies around the world sticking her nose in everybody else's business instead of staying home, washing the President's jock strap in the White House sink. So screw off, and I'll let my lawyer contact you. Go on, get out. Go on. All of you. Out. Out. Out. I want to ask you a question. How much government tax is on a bottle of whiskey? Thirty cents. Do you realize, that if I gave up drinking, you two imbeciles would be out of a job? Now, go on, get out. Get out, I said. (DOOR CLOSES) Mr. Fields. What? I think I love you. Ha. Shit! (JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING) Oh, my God! Is that Charlie Chaplin? Yes, it is. Listen, that, ah, snack we had earlier at home, it, ah, did that make you feel ill? No. Huh, uh. I feel fine. A little while afterwards I got a pain in my stomach. I thought it would pass, but it, ah... It didn't. I think we should go home. Oh, can't we go in for just a little while? No, no, no. We'd better go right away. Right away. I don't want to get sick in there. I can't understand how just the sight of Charlie Chaplin can make you sick. You can't? Well, he's number one. Numero uno. But he's not. You're right up there with him. No, I'm not. I'm number two. Numetwo-o. In this business, two's not even a number. Nobody counts past one. When you're second, life's like a mother who loves you next to best. Like a dame who only sees you on slow nights. Well, I didn't leave home at 11 to freeze and starve all those years just to be second. Number two. Sooner or later all little girls... The line is, "Sooner or later all pretty little girls have to leave their daddies." I know what the line is. Can we do another one right away, please? MAN: Right. Roll 'em! And action. And so I'm getting married, Daddy. But that doesn't mean I won't always be your little girl. Of course, my darling. Sooner or later all little girls have to leave their daddies. But do you have to go away? I'm afraid so. But before I go, let me leave you with a bit of fatherly advice. Yes. Never give a sucker an even break. Ah, cut it! The hell with it. Crap. It's no good. Is something bothering you? Yeah, there's something bothering me. You! You, you're bothering me! Get off my set. I can't work when you're on my set. Because you bum rapped me on your radio show, Sunday, that's why. I didn't rap you, Bill. I rapped your last picture. I can't believe that you'd take that kind of thing personally. I don't take it personally. I don't take it personally when it's about Buster Keaton or Harold Lloyd, but I take it very personally when it's about me. Christ, that's petty. Don't you call me petty! Go on, you pencil-pushing mongoloid! I'll break 85 of your 84 vertebrates! That was a stupid son of a bitching thing to do. Didn't you realize he's the most influential movie critic in this country? Can you imagine what he's gonna do to your next picture? On the radio and in the newspapers? Screw 'em. Screw 'em. Sure. Screw 'em. Ha, you wouldn't of done it if you hadn't been drinking. The assistant director tells me you've been pissed and blowing your lines the past few weeks. So screw the assistant director, too. Ah, this is gettin' to be a real goddamn problem, Bill. A real goddamned problem. Well, if you don't want more of a problem, let me get back in there, go to work and finish the film. (SLURRING) ♪ I loved her too ♪ And, oh, baby ♪ Won't you please come home? ♪ 'Cause you left me all alone ♪ ♪ Have a banana ♪ (MEN LAUGHING) How glorious it is to leave the nonsense of making a motion picture and embark on the pursuit of enlightenment and culture with those friends you love. Hear, hear. Hear, hear. I'll drink to that. I'll drink to anything. Six ball in the side pocket. Hey! Shivering shinola! My God! (MEN LAUGHING) I met him in Bombay years ago. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. (WOMAN VOCALIZING) Son of a bitch! That's Jeanette MacDonald. She's a nuisance. She makes a sound like a monsoon whistling through an aardvark's ass. MacDonald, what hole is that horrible sound emanating from? (ALL SNICKERING) (WOMAN SINGING) (VOCALIZING IN HIGH-PITCH) (SNIFFING) (MEN LAUGHING) You sing like one of Nelson Eddy's swans! Stud. Me favorite. Are the little boys staying for dinner? Is dinner on? No. Why not? Well, I couldn't sing, so I decided to read. To the kitchen, slave, or you'll be banished from the master's bed. (MEN CHUCKLE) The Royal Jewels will be withheld. Damn right they'll be withheld. Listen, you two drive safely. Leon, you take Mr. Barrymore home and, Jack, watch your banana. (LAUGHING) I don't know why it strikes me funny. There you go, my motley crew. Well, if there's a God in heaven, we'd better pray for their deliverance. Going to bed, Chinaman, feel a little tired. (CONTINUES LAUGHING) I'll be leaving in the morning. What do you mean? I mean, I'm going away. Away from me? Yes. Why? Because you treated me like a tramp tonight in front of your friend. You even slapped me on the backside. Oh, now come on, Chinaman. Don't ruin my day. That's just a game that the boys play in front of each other. Don't you understand things like that? No. Well, it's... It's locker room stuff. It's like measuring to see who has the biggest thing. And by making me look cheap, does that mean that you have? Okay. I'm sorry about that. But no more of that going away crap. When the boys were here today, you even let them think you go to bed with me. I told you, that's just part of the game. But I've been here six weeks and you've never even touched me. (SHUSHING) For Christ sakes, don't tell them that. Why not? Well, it's just that... (STUTTERS) Do you know how much I really respect you? Are you afraid of getting turned down? No. I just don't know whether to be your father or be your lover. I wouldn't turn you down on either. Oh! (CHUCKLES) Do you know what that means? What? I'll have to stay sober. I think tropical fish are one of the most sensible pets a man can have. Readily housebroken and easily subdued with a long whip. My, my, you are getting mellow. First adopting tropical fish and now doing a movie with a baby. I want to keep this one in the house so Nelson Eddy's swan can't get at it. Are you happy to be going back to work? I suppose so. But all babies are bastards. Can't stand their milk breath. (CHUCKLES) I've got something very important to say to you. Well, I'll tell ya, I have an appointment this afternoon. In fact, you'd better tell me quickly, 'cause I got to go get examined for insurance that's before the movies starts. It's a new rule the stupid studios put out. Well, I've got something on my mind that's been there for a long time now. Okay. Shoot, Chinaman. Well, you said that you felt complete now that I'm with you. I do, yes. Well, I'd like to be able to feel the same way. Don't you? Why can't I have a career and you? Oh. Look, my dear, I can smell star quality a mile away. And you just don't have it. I want to find out for myself. I can tell you that. Get me a screen test. You can do it. I can't do that. Then I can't stay with you any longer. I've got to find out for myself if I have talent. You really want it that bad? Well, I guess I'll have to give you a screen test. I can't be unfair to you, Chinaman. Oh, I love you for that. Well, I love you, too. We'll get, ah, Jack Barrymore to do the test with you. we might as well do it first class, all the way. (PEOPLE TALKING INDISTINCTLY) Carlotta. You look beautiful. I'm so proud of you. You haven't had one drink, have you? No, my dear. This is where I live. One doesn't foul one's own nest. In her service in more ways than meets the eye. I am her Majesty's subject. And my hypocrite. Make yourself an honest man and I know that at least there's one less rogue in the world. MAN: Okay, cut. Wrap it up. That's Carlotta Monti, Test 337A. Wonderful, Miss Monti. Thank you. Mr. Barrymore, just great. Okay, Sandy. You can go home now. Thank you. Well, what do you think? She's good, isn't she? BARRYMORE: She's green, but she'd learn fast. Interesting quality, I feel. Yes, she has. Well, I'm ready to call the New York boys and tell them to put her under contract. Yeah, well, you do that, and I'll never make a picture for you again. Tell you what I want you to do, I want you to phone her, you phone her as a friend, and you advise her to forget it. Use a little of that razzle-dazzle of yours. You're very good at that. But let her down gently. Don't crush her. What I mean is, if I'm gonna stoop as low as this, I want her back in one piece. Ah, come on, Jack, don't look at me like that. You know a girl's an easy mark in this town for every pimp, casting couch and phony producer. Well, she is, isn't she? CARLOTTA: (SOBBING) How could I have fooled myself? (STUTTERING) How could I have kidded myself? How could I have kidded myself like that? How can I want something so bad, so bad, and be no good? Just no damn good. He didn't say you were no good. He didn't say I was no good, but that's what he meant. He was beating around the bush, but that's what he was trying to tell me. You know what I really hate? What? I hate letting you down. That's the way you feel, isn't it? No, I don't. But you have to. But I don't. What's really terrible, I'm not only bad actress, but without you, I would never have gotten this far. Because I'm weak, I'm just basically weak. I never would have had that screen test without you. You had to get it for me. I'll never be anything. I'll never have a career. But you have a career. Your career is right here taking care of me. That's your career. Would you ever marry me? (STUTTERS) Look. You get some sleep. And we'll talk about it in the morning. Answer me! Would you ever marry me? Marriage is only a piece of paper. Why is it so goddamn important? Because Catholics have to be married. Horseshit! How about the Pope? What's the matter? He just bit my nose. That's the second time. I want the little son of a bitch arrested. Arrested? Yes. I want him to be the only two-year-old in Alcatraz. I'll talk to his mother before the next scene. There ain't gonna be no next scene. I quit. Oh, listen, Bill. I'll buy the kid a plaything that'll involve him and take his attention off your nose. Get him a cobra. And I want to tell you something. I want my nose insured, and I want the studio to pay for it. Did you see the fangs on that two-year-old? By the time he's 11, he'll be a full-fledged werewolf. Bill, the thing to do is not hold him up near your face. If you want to show affection, pat him on the head. Keep him down below your waist. Below my waist? Where the hell will he bite me then? I'm glad you picked up my signal. Well, what is it? What's the matter? You seem so upset. Carlotta, we've got a very sick man on our hands. I just got the studio doctor's report. You see, that wasn't a new studio rule, it was especially for Fields. We want to get insurance against his drinking and holding up the picture. We couldn't get it. His kidneys are just about shot and his liver's like a sieve. Oh, my God. Oh, don't tell him that. He's so proud, it would kill him if he knew it. Carlotta, what the hell's holding you up? I'm coming. I was just filling your martini thermos. Gimme that. Thank you. Are you watering down my booze? No. Well, somebody is screwing around with it. Leon! You been drinking my gin and then filling it up with water? No, sir, Mr. Fields. Not me. I am. I'm doing it. Why? Because I can't stand it when you're drinking. I hate you drunk. Let me tell you something. I don't want you to come to the studio with me today. I don't want you to come on the set anymore. (CAR DOOR CLOSING) Get Baby Harold. We are ready to go. Everybody on the set, ready to shoot. Come on, come on. We haven't got time to wait. Will somebody please get Baby Harold? (FIELDS VOCALIZING) LA CAVA: (SHOUTING) Where the goddamn hell is Baby Harold? Baby Harold is drunk. Somebody put gin in his orange juice. (ALL LAUGHING) (VOCALIZING) You didn't. You wouldn't. Ah, I would and I did. I had a hunch the little bastard couldn't hold his liquor. ♪ Yumpity-dum-dum ♪ You got to picture this. Here you have a two-year-old in the middle of his first tooth. And his crowning accomplishment was biting his mother right on the ass. But I have hope for him. I think he'll grow up to be a real mean drunk. Anyway, while he is, ah, sobering up on pabulum and Alka-Seltzer, I'll have myself a little snooze. I've seen you around, but I can't place the face. I'm Edward. I work at the studio gym. Mr. Bannerman told me to hang around and make myself useful. Bannerman? Yeah. Useful, how? Well, he thought, in between shots, while you're waiting around, maybe we could do a little putting, some road work, you know. Putting and road work? (CHUCKLING) Very good. Very good. You must be joking. You don't need that, Mr. Fields. I don't need a keeper. Gimme my drink! I can't let you drink. What the hell is this? Is this some kind of insult? Well, I'll tell you what you can do! You can go directly and I mean directly to the idiot who is head of this studio and you tell him that I don't shoot one more foot of film while he treats me like an inmate in a booby hatch! You tell him that! FIELDS: I shouldn't have been surprised at what happened. After all, the chemical composition of this world is oxygen, nitrogen and bullshit! BARRYMORE: How long shall we remain in old Mexico? I'm not comin' back until that bastard, Baby Harold, is too old to make the picture. SPECTATORS: Ole! Ole. (CHEERING) (TALKING INDISTINCTLY) What I hate about fountains is they got water in 'em. I've been a matinee idol for 25 years, I've been given many, many tokens of adulation, but never a bull's testicles. (LAUGHING) I've only seen one other pair that size in my life. GENE: Really? My Aunt Margaret. Totally killed her career as a cricket player. (MEN SINGING IN SPANISH) (GURGLING) GENE: I like it. Seems like some visiting idiot politician's gonna give a speech out there. AMERICAN POLITICIAN: In friendship, mutual interest... (TRANSLATOR SPEAKING IN SPANISH) And respect... (TRANSLATING IN SPANISH) I bring you heartfelt good wishes... (TRANSLATING IN SPANISH) And felicitations from your American cousins, north of the Rio Grande... (TRANSLATING IN SPANISH) ...on this auspicious and symbolic... (ALL MURMURING) Ole. FIELDS: Get out of here! Oh, watch out, you'll break your of furniture against door taco. Well, I know one thing. It's not my agent. He doesn't try that hard. (MEN LAUGHING) We're stronger than the brass pelio. (BANGING CONTINUES) God, I hope it's the maid. (MAN TALKING INDISTINCTLY) (MEN LAUGHING) I thought I'd find you here. Hi, Harry. This is it, Bill. This is the last goddamn straw. You made a complete horse's ass out of yourself. Do you know what it cost the studio to get you out of jail? I'll pay you back right now, Harry. You got change for five, Gene? Sorry. Never carry any big bills on Thursday. This is serious, you goddamn clowns! We've got a picture to finish! What is this idiotic obsession to... To impress each other by how much booze you can drink and how many women you can allegedly screw? A psychiatrist ought to have something to say about this. Listen, I don't care what you say to me, but I care what you say to my friends! 'Cause my friends are precious to me. Well, if they were really your friends, not help you pour it down your throat and kill yourself, Bill. Keep out of this, Dave! Listen to me! What do you know about real men? Real men drink together. And real men screw together. But what the hell would you know about that, Harry? Well, what are you looking at? Go on, eat, drink. I'll tell you something else. I'll finish your...picture and I'll tear up the contract and I'll sign with some other stupid studio. You'll fulfill your contract with me, or I'll have you blackballed at every studio in this town. What's wrong? He's threatening me. Making a threat that only a drunk would make. You're an alcoholic, Bill. You hurt not only yourself, but everybody around you. Shut up. Just shut up. That isn't true. Isn't it? Ask him something. Ask him why, when I liked your screen test and wanted to put you under contract, you're not making pictures? Ask him that. Ask him why he killed it. Ask him. What's he talking about? Is he telling me you killed it for me? You let me feel that I was that bad? Why would you do that to me? I was just... I was trying to protect ya. That's all. Protect you from the pimps, the casting couches, the cheap actors. I was trying to protect you, that's all. Protect me? It seems the only thing I need protection from is you. You're right. Oh, you're right. I am petty and cheap. You know I'm possessive. But how could you do something so underhanded to me? Well, as my dearly departed Papa once said, "Anything worth having, "it's worth cheating for." Stop it! Just stop it! (GLASS SHATTERS) Quit hiding behind that cheap vaudevillian delivery! Speaking of vaudeville, reminds me of the vaudevillian who spent the night with a blind hooker... For Christ sakes, shut up! Your brain so goddamned pickled you don't know when to shut up, Jack? Chinaman! No more Chinaman! I'm going to New York where you can't kill my chances. FIELDS: When I realized that Leon always carried a roll of mints, all the pieces fell into place. I was a mint carrier myself, until I owned up to being a boozer. Leon's sneaking alcohol, however, has not changed my deep affection for him. Lucky for colored orphans. I am, at this writing, an unemployed actor. Harry Bannerman swears I'll never work at the studio again, and contractually, I cannot work at any other. I'm also on the crappola list with Dave Chasen, having used his fine restaurant to punch out another movie critic. Although, I'm not the type to assign guilt, if I am hostile and pugnacious, it's entirely your fault. Signed with love, and the hope that this letter does not depress you. Fields. (BELL RINGING) (SPEAKING IN GERMAN) Happy birthday, Ludwig. Willie! Oh! Oh, thank you! Yeah. How goes it? It goes good. And you? Me? It goes, ah... up and down. Up and down. Listen. I'm a few days early, but I brought your birthday present. Ja? Ja. Don't move. Ja. You be gentle with her. I'm not gonna tell her how many hearts you've broken. FIELDS: It's been three months since I heard a word from the studio. It seems like a supreme battle of wills between Harry Bannerman and myself. I'm not sleeping a wink, even though we are well into the rainy season. I was banned from the friars club last night for mashing an egg salad sandwich in the face of a brother friar. but when one has been misused by life, he will soon misuse others. Hope while you're away from me you're not being too promiscuous. Love, Fields. Send it straight wire. Message. Dear Carlotta, have terrible news. Jack Barrymore died suddenly last night. Stop. Funeral, Thursday. What I'd give for one drink with him. I'm glad you didn't paint him up too much. Will he have a fresh carnation for the funeral tomorrow? Fresh carnation? Yeah. You got it. What time is the funeral? 10 a.m. Hope we get him back in time. Oh, he wouldn't want to miss it. He's actually looking goddamned good for such a sick man. Ah, the lucky son of a bitch. He... He finally got to wear his new suit. I know why he's not drinking. Look at that. The ice is melted. You know, it's the first time he didn't knock my cheap booze. (TELEPHONE RINGING) Coast Guard. (FIELDS TALKING) What was that, sir? Do I think the atmospheric conditions have changed in the last 10 years? Well, ah... I really don't think. I... I'm not sure, sir. Seems to you the weather in California is changing? Not as much rain? Well, I feel like I only really sleep when it rains. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I think I'm being burgled. You'd better call the police. I'll hang up. (BOTH SCREAMING) (SIGHS) Jesus Christ! I thought you were a burglar. Well, are you glad to see me? Why'd you decide to come back? Not enough push for New York? I came back because I couldn't stand the way you were suffering. Especially since Jack died. And I sensed in your last letter that you may have changed your mind about wanting to marry me. Well, Jack's death grieved me deeply. Part of my life is gone. Welcome home, Chinaman. Jack's death must've been a terrible shock for you. Well, ah, it wasn't a shock, exactly. You know, I... I kept my eye on Jack. (CHUCKLES) I mean, I watched him. I... I saw him failing swiftly and... I watched what it did to him. And you realized something about yourself? Jack was a great artist. He was one of a kind. He was brilliant. But he didn't have my constitution, you see. Now, to some people, alcohol is a poison. See? Like a chemical reaction. And me, all my life, I've been lucky. I mean, all it ever gave me was a (WHISTLING) hangover. Oh, ah... By the way, about marriage, ah... I think we should. Eventually. Eventually. We can't do it right away, you see, because, ah, I got a picture coming up. I mean, I had a meeting with Bannerman. Now, he didn't kiss my ass and I didn't kiss his ass. We're... We're on equal terms again, sort of egalite. Going to do a picture with Mae West. You like her? A lady with abundant charm and wit. She and I have reached complete accord on the script, except for my entrance. She'd like me not to enter at all. Okay. Eight ball. Nemesis of the Nimble. Ah, I better get out my special weapon. Here we go. Come to me, my sweetheart. The mother. Here it is, the one and only Minerva. (LA CAVA SHUSHING) Given to me by a retired dentist named Gums. Ah, I'll try this the hard way. Cut! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, very much. I'd like to take this opportunity to introduce to you my favorite lady bartender. She never goes anywhere without a purse full of twists, olives and pearls. Pearl onions that is. Hope you'll soon be entertaining overseas, Mr. Fields. Oh, God freed Daniel. Yeah, oh, I plan to do better than that, my dear. In fact, as some of the members of the press are here, I'd like to, ah, make this announcement. That upon the completion of this film, I plan to join Mr. Clark Gable, Mr. Jimmy Stewart and Mr. Gary Cooper in combat duty overseas. (CROWD CHEERING) (MEN LAUGHING) MAN: We can't use you. What do you mean you can't use me? You gotta use me. You have to use me. It's in all the newspapers. You put me in your friggin' war and it'll be over in two weeks. Now, wait a minute! You put my buddies in with me, and it'll only take a week longer. No, I'm afraid, Mr. Fields, you're just a little too old. Old? Wait. Wait a second. Wait a minute. I got the heart, the lungs and the bladder of a 19-year-old. But listen... Listen. From where I stand, I have serious doubts about your physical fitness. And don't laugh. I had an uncle, he died 20 years ago. We dug him up last Wednesday, and he looks better than you do. (ALL LAUGHING) Where have you been? I've been having a helluva time. Fowler, La Cava and I, we went down to the Army Induction Center... Someone's waiting for you. He'll have to wait. We went down to the Army Induction Center... He says he is your son. He's in the living room. You never told me you had a son. Because I never told anybody. (DOOR SLAMS) Sit down. How about a drink? I don't drink. You don't drink? Just soft drinks. You're no son of mine! You're an imposter! I'll tell you what you are. You're a Patagonian half breed. A refugee Aztec. I'm sorry to disappoint you, sir. I'll tell you something else. I was very fair to your mother. I've sent her a check every week ever since we've been married and a little something extra on Christmas. I know that. Why'd you come here? Because you're my father and I haven't seen you since I was three. To me, you're the funniest man alive. Because I'm your father? No. I don't think so. Funniest, including everybody? Including everybody. Including Chaplin? Including Chaplin. Well... (CHUCKLES) I've succeeded with my son. Never tried, but I've succeeded. I was a son of a bitch to your mother, you know that, don't you? Who'd expect W.C. Fields to be anything else? Where are you staying? My bags are at the Y. At the Y, huh? Well, I'll tell you what I want you to do. Tomorrow morning I want you to get your bags and, ah... bring 'em here, Son. (CAR DRIVING AWAY) Please, try not to hate me. I don't hate you. But why didn't you ever tell me you were married? I never told anyone. Because marriage is for guys who are poor fish and suckers. A real man don't go running home to the little woman at dinner time. He goes any place he pleases and he stays as long as he likes and he boozes and he doesn't let any woman nail him. That's not a man. That's a boy trying to act like a man. Oh! Oh! (SOBBING) Oh, oh! Oh, my God! Oh. Oh. (AMBULANCE SIRENS WAILING) Well, he's stable now. Oh, thank God. I think you ought to know he's a very, very sick man. If he ever takes another drink in his life, he's committing suicide. Well, I'm going to get some sleep. Why don't you, huh? He told me he drank a quart of gin every day for 30 years. Is that true? He lied. I thought so. He drank two. Holy Christ! One time I said to him, "It's either our friendship or liquor. "Which will it be?" "When it comes to loyalty, I've known liquor a lot longer." What the hell goes on between you two? A conspiracy? Now, whose idea was it to stick me with that morbid- looking San Francisco quack? You know what that anemic idiot did? He cut off my booze! If he ever took a stiff drink, they'd have to put him on ice and put a tag on his toe. I, ah...got to talk to him. We, ah, talked quite a bit. He seems all right. Would you like to sit down? Thank you. While I was in the room he told me all about you. He said that he loved you very much. Listen. I want to thank you for being so good to my father. He's been very lucky to have you. (BREATHING HEAVILY) Why don't you try to get some sleep? I can't sleep. I'm never gonna sleep in a hospital. I want to go home. You can go home when you're well. Oh, Chinaman, I'm a mean old bag of sticks and the man in the satin sandals is not gonna get me for a long, long time. Please? Isn't there anywhere you can get me a drink? Absolutely not. You have to make a pledge never to drink again. You got the pledge. Now, let's drink to it. Don't be funny. Okay. (SIGHING) (WHISPERING) Oh, Chinaman, I wish I could sleep. I wish to God I could sleep. Why doesn't it rain? Do you want me to rub your back for you? Might help you relax. The only thing that would help me relax would be a couple martinis and no olives. Now, you go get some rest. Go on. (DOOR CLOSES) (SOFT CLATTERING) (RAIN PATTERING) CARLOTTA: Fields slept that night, and in the morning, stormed out of the hospital calling the doctor a half-breed (CHUCKLING) Communist quack. I started to think he was indestructible or the luckiest man alive. But Fields' luck finally ran out on Christmas day of 1946. Among the thousands of letters and telegrams people sent, the most ironic came from Charlie Chaplin. Who said that Fields had a genius for comedy that often made him feel envious. The films of W.C. Fields have lived on and on. So as hard as it would have been for Fields to admit it, maybe Charlie Chaplin, was right. (INAUDIBLE)
