In death, an overflowing emptiness. The presence of the infinate. Eyes of our dimension. Wings of invisible light. The restless eye of the spirit dispells the myths of the arcane, glimpsing future fragments. All is present. Never seen. My darling it's me. I've just finished the test and it's a 20 minute flight from here to Paris so I should just get to you around 8. Just in time for our... intimate little dinner. Hey, why don't you whip-up some of those great Cr?pes Grand Marnier. Love you darling. See you soon. Cybil Cybil Can you hear me? What kind of joke is this? It's not a joke. I'm sending you this message from the future. I'm speaking to you from the future. As if I were already dead. I'm not yet, but I will be soon. I'm at your side... protecting you. Delirium. Don't be frightened. Who are you?! Let me see you! Strange things will happen which you will find inexplicable. But in the infinate... in the future, everything's clear. You're alive?! ...And you're speaking to me from the future?! The future is as real as the present. Except that it exists in a dimension that eyes cannot see. Only the priveledged few are allowed to glimpse it. But here and beyond, everything is simple. Who are you?! I'm you. But you can't possibly understand. You only lit one candle. Now, make the flames touch. See how the two flames become one. That's how we are. Two candles, one flame. If you're me... let me see you. Soon I will be leaving this place. Hi darling! I'm here! On time as usual. Oh my, aren't we elegant. Pearls and black lace. Oh Gerard, I'm scarred. I think there's a ghost here. What? No way! No really. She spoke to me. From the future as if she were dead. But she was still alive. Hey, what have you been smoking? You've gotta believe me. I'm not crazy, I heard it! Come here, listen. I don't hear anything. A concert programme. Did Corine bring it? Yes, I saw her this afternoon. She said she was me! The two flames became one. - I see... - It's absurd I know. What about those Cr?pes Grand Marnier? I'm starving. Gerard... You have to believe me. She spoke to me. My dear, did you see her? Did you touch her? Then she doesn't exist... It's just a fantasy. Your artists mind at work. Please don't worry about it. Oh god... Don't take her from me. Please. I beg of you. Darling, don't leave me. Please, don't abandon me. What? I'm here my love. If she dies, Van Gogh is finished. Two flames... in one. In one? Delirium. The concert that you love so much. The doctor's on the way. We won't make it in time, the maestro knew this would happen. - How's that? -He can see into the future. Don't leave me Christine. I can't live without you, my love. Won't you... always... I'm sorry maestro. It's all over. Take my inspiration with you. Why go on living? I always loved you... but I never did tell you. Herman?! You bastard! You son-of-a bitch! How could you do this?! How dare you touch my Christine! Bastard! Bastard! You're choking me ...choking me! Oh look, the opening of an art exhibiton. Charles Sensimone. Let's go. It's in three weeks. Darling, it's right at the beginning of the concert season. Don't let yourself be distracted by a gallery opening. But we could at least go and take a look. You don't really think you're invited, do you? That invitation blew in off the street on a gust of wind. It was intended for someone else, not you. In a week you start practising with the orchestra, right? It came in from out there. ...From somewhere. Why was it sent to me? You're on that occult kick again. Don't get the impression it was some kind of destiny. It means nothing... There's no mystery darling, just an accident. ...Sheer coincidence. I'd throw it away if I were you. Gerard, where is your sense of curiosity and wonder? If you can't see it, you don't believe it. You got it! Where is she? I don't feel it anymore... Her music... Christine's music. Christine... I'll bring you home. Open it. Look what this past year has done to you. I'll breathe life into you again. - She looks better now, don't you think? - Yes. Gently. She's laughing at me! Get her out of here! Get her out of here! Burn them! Burn them! Burn them all! I can't stand to look at them anymore! Thank God you can't find the ones that have gone to the show. They're all crap! Scatter the ashes to the wind! Burn everything! My wedding present to you is a new grand piano. Is that grand enough for you? It's just what every girl needs. It's yours then. And what kind of gift would my best pilot like? What about his own personal helicopter? That's not bad. Hey wait, stop! Look Gerard... It's the San Simone opening. You never come this way. Yet today, you did. Do you still think that it's a... ...a coincidence? What else could it be? You don't still have that tattered, old invitation, do you? No, it was filthy and I didn't want to catch some nasty disease. But it's free. We can still go and have a look around anyway. I have something serious to do. I have to go to work. But if you want to go in, then go ahead. The red, the yellow, the green. All express different intentions. Such torment... Maestro, I was told that you destroyed over a 100 paintings like this, is it true? All of them were worthless. I'm not sure I grasp all the symbolic references, but this is an unusual work it contains very mysterious and provocative elements related to parapsychology. Christine? Yes? It looks like me. How strange... That's what I do for a living. I'm a pianist. - Do we know each other? - Yes. Better than you think. We lived together once, over there. There? Yes, at least a part of you did. We were happy there. It doesn't make sense. I've never seen this place before. No no, you're right. I'm talking about Christine. My wife, my model. She's a wonderful pianist. It was through her music and presence, that I was able to develop what small gift for painting that I have. Without her, none of this work here would exist. She sounds interesting. Is she here? She died. Over a year ago now. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Before she died, she promised to come back to me. I can hardly believe it but it's true. You've come back haven't you? It's so odd... we are identical. Like two drops of water. Perhaps only one. What? The restless eye of the spirit dispells the myth of the arcane. Glimpsing future fragments. Always present, never seen. The future and the present? I've heard that before. The future already exists to be revealed by the passage of time. Only there are gifted people who are always in touch with it. I'm leaving tomorrow for Morocco, will you come? We've so much to talk about. I'll be expecting you. You ask me what it means? These bold colours represent nature in transformation.... Nothing more, nothing less. He believes in reincarnation... I understand he thinks he was Van Gogh in a previous life. It's so obvious. Thank heavens... Thank heavens she's come back to me. It will be just like before. What the hell is this? Christine! Christine! Oh, maestro. Is it really you? I'm so glad to see you here. I'm Sybil, I met you at the show. In fact I was taking you up on your invitation. But I lost my way in the fog. Then my car broke down. Of course I remember you... Christines double. You must excuse me... ...for a moment I was confused. I thought you were a figment of my imagination. It was so kind of you to invite me, I couldn't refuse. It was wonderfull of you to come. You have no idea how much this means to me. Come ride with me. I'll have your car picked-up. Thank you. Perhaps I'm living in another dimension. Just me and my ghosts. Like many artists that are tortured by their dreams. I too am like that. - It's so hard to get free. - That's right. This is La Rocha. It's been in my family for centuries. Madame Christine?! I'd like you to meet Herman. He's been with me for a great number of years. Sybil will be staying with us for a few days. Her car broke just down the road. See what you can do. Here's the key. This way. This is my studio. That's interesting... What is it? Satan fathering the universe. Was this Christines? Delirium... Christine played that. When she touched the keys, I felt alive. I suffered a most intoxicating creative inspiration. Maestro, at the show I heard somebody mention your afinity for... For Van Gogh? I've loved him ever since I was a child. I see. His great sadness, a profound sense of unrest and bitterness. The paintings are bitter, like reality. My ideas no longer penetrate the canvas. I'm living and working in a fog... where there's no more colour. She modeled for me when she was young. I fell deeply in love with her. Perhaps it will return. The work, the love. It seems the only thing missing in your life is Christine. Yes, perhaps when we were parted. It's happened before. One soul in two bodies. One person in two places at the same time. There are many examples - Two flames which burn as one. - Yes. It happens. I'm sorry, I don't understand. Please, help me. I want you to work with me. Together we can create something that will live forever. Excuse me maestro. Mrs Sybil... Your room is ready now. May I? Would you like to rest up before dinner? Do you like it? Is it for me? I bought it for Christine but she was never able to wear it. It doesn't seem quite right. I always knew you would come... and that crazy servant of mine Herbert, always anticipates my orders. You're also the same size. I'll wait for you down stairs. Make an entrance. Enchanting. Who are you now? Christine or Sybil? What a beautiful spot. Ideal for a painter. It's all in ruins. Abandoned for years. It's too damned lonely here. I'm often tempted to burn it, and go down with my rock. Maestro Van Gogh, dinner is served. Herman's always joking. I'm afraid one day he'll cut off my ear. - Bordeaux? - Thank you. Welcome home. To your health. It's alright maam, I'll find the trouble. Best piece of ass in the whole province. Her name's Yvonne. If you want any help with that Jalopy you're gonna have to wait till tomorrow. I'm the only one here. I'll manage, I work real good with my hands. Pop the can, I'm crazy about men who know what they're doing. I think I'll walk back to La Rocha, I'll see you later. Okay, won't take me long to fix this thing. I'll be right behind you. Hey, what's the problem now, can't get it going? - I can get it going alright, just watch this... - Hands off the merchandise! - Let go of me! - Get back here! - I'm gonna get me a piece of this. - Bastard! Oh no you don't. Let go of me! Let go of me or I'll cut your face! I... I'm just joking. I was only having a little fun. That's a load of crap! Keep away or I'll cut your balls off! Maestro? Bad dog. It's an electric latch to keep the dogs out. It works in the refrigerators where we keep our meats and cheeses the dogs would eat the lot of they get in there and then there'll be nothing left for us to eat and if the window's left open, the crows fly in Where's the maestro? Upstairs. Tame the demon, satan. I can't. It doesn't come! I... I can't... Maestro, what's the matter? I want to express the ferment of life in evolution. But I don't know the first thing about evolution, or life! Is there anything I can do to help? Can you give me the colour of suffering? The colour of life? This magnificent planet lost in the vortex of the infinate galaxy. Our useless pride Drowned in the eternal sea of chaos. Seems like you're not the only one with a problem round here tonight. What? Herman, he's another thorn in my side. Christine took him in out of sympathy, and now I'm stuck with him. Hey!... That's Corine. She's a friend of mine. She lives in Paris too. I didn't know you knew her? In fact, I don't. But every so often I see her face.... I feel her presence. Her spirit appeared to me only yesterday. I know she's going to come into my life. And you see her clearly enough... to paint her picture? Help! Somebody help me! You better go to your room now. Here, take the painting. Lock the door. Whatever happens, don't leave your room. - But I... - Good night, Sybil. Get your hands off me you asshole! Help me! Come here, you bitch! Dirty little bitch! Come back here! Let me go! Let me go! Get your hands off me! Go away! Go away! Get your hands off me! You're a lunatic, you miserable pervert. How much longer am I going to have to put up with this insanity?! Get some water, we have to clean up this blood. Hurry damn you! This is it! This... This is the colour I need. I can use this. My empty heart. It's much better mixed. The blood loss meanwhile... is the colour of intimate breath. There's little human blood to be had to paint with. You shall live on. The knowledge equal to dark necessity. Perfect. Herman! Take her away. Now! And don't you dare molest her. What's that? Put that down Herman. Down! Sybil, where are you going? Herman hasn't finished with your car yet. Don't leave me again. I'll take care of you. Don't be frightened. no... no! - Stop it! - Be quiet. Be quiet! Don't worry, you won't feel a thing. Where... Where am I? I need more blood. I desire my ability to flourish. The transformation of colour. Oh please answer. Hello? Corine... Corine, It's Sybil. You've got to help me. It's terrible. - I can't believe this is happening. - What? I can hardly hear you. It's 3 in the morning Sybil, what's going on? They're going to kill me Corine. Help me, they're going to... Hello?! Hello?! Sybil! Hello... Are you there?! Answer me... Please Sybil, where are you?! Hello! Sybil! Hello! Sybil... How am I supposed to find out where you are? Get away from her, you idiot! Who was she talking to? Corine? In Paris? I believe so sir. I believe so. Let's get her down here... I need more colour. You're going to have to go for a little drive. 5A Rue De Bleu. Bring her to me. No thanks, I don't want to buy anything. Excuse me... Mademoiselle Corine. What's the matter? Your friend, Mademoiselle Sybil. She's not feeling well. She needs your help. What's happened to her? She can tell you that for herself. That's her car. Just a moment. Hi, this is the answering machine of Jerard De Fray. I'm out of town, but if you leave a message, I'll call you when I get back. Gerard, Corine. Listen, I think Sybil needs help but I don't know where she is. - As soon as you arrive back from London, call... - The time for leaving your message is now up. Shit! Where's the gun. Maam. There's no more blood. Take her last drops. She's too beautiful to rot underground. No, wait... Save her for that museum of yours. No! No wait! I don't want to see it! Gerard, Corine. Listen, I think Sybil needs help but I don't know where she is. - As soon as you arrive back from London, call... - The time for leaving your message is now up. Shit. Christ! Excuse me. Sorry sir... Sorry sir, were about to close. All I really wanted was some information. Is the San Simone show still on? It closed a couple days ago. However... if you're interested in buying one of his paintings. No, I'm looking for San Simone himself. We're shipping these back to him now... You're welcome to go with the truck. It maybe too late. - Excuse me sir. - Sorry, I'm busy now. Maestro, Listen! A helicopter! The police! How am I supposed to paint with you bursting in here Herman! But maestro Van Gogh. Come, take a look. They're searching the area. We're in a lot of trouble. They're looking for Yvonne. Perhaps they're not looking for Yvonne. Perhaps they're looking for Corine... or Sybil. Or any one one of those monsters in that grotesque abattoir of yours. Get rid of it! They're going away. They'll be back. You can see into the future... what will happen to us? I don't see anything clearly all I know it's the beginning of the end. - I'm gonna pack, I'm getting outta here! - Herman! I don't want Mademoiselle to start screaming again, go to her. - Maestro... - I don't want to be distracted. She's sleeping like an angel. Give her another shot. Go now. - Thanks. - No problem. - Hey you, come on. - Just a minute. - What is it? - I've got to tie my shoe. I won't be a second. If these are damaged, you'll pay. There. Through there. Hey! Is this your play room? No strangers allowed. Easy, the doors were open, so I looked inside. Get out! - What's the big deal? Since when is it a crime to... - Shut your mouth! - Can I go and shake the maestro's hand? - No! He's busy, can't you see! The opening was a great success. A lot of important people came. For instance Sybil Le Clerc. - Didn't she visit the maestro recently? - We don't have guests here. - I know she was invited. - Who are you? What do you want? - Can't you see? I work for the gallery. - Then shut up, and get to work! Go! That's Sybil's car! Stop! Stop the van! Gerard... Christ, what the hell is that? Beat it, get out of here. Sybil... What have you done with her you bastard?! Gerard... Corin.... Jesus Christ! I'll see to it they meet their doom Corin. Sybil... Sybil! Sybil! Sybil! help. Who are you? - How the hell did you get in here? - Where's Sybil?! What have you done with her? What have you done with her?!! Where the fuck is she?! Sybil. Sybil! Out of my way! Sybil! Sybil, are you there? - Gerard... - Please Sybil... For god sakes, open the door! For Christs sake... Sybil. Sybil, open the door! Oh Gerard. All hell's broken loose around here. Sweet Sybil... time is running out. I know it. But I must complete my last masterpiece... and you must help me... Christine would have helped me. What other ideas do you have in mind, you shit! Please try to understand. - It's an act of love. - That's bullshit! Why go on with this charade?! You're insane! What'll I do with him? Take them to my studio. Both of them... we'll need a great deal of red. My next painting will be entitled 'Blood Wedding' Son of a bitch! Now you'll live forever. No one has found such colour before. Not in oil or tempera. What a precious gift. Christine! Tell me why! Now you... Chistine! You can do no more evil you cursed man. Damn you. So, you think you're Van Gogh? Christine, two flames that that burn as one. Chistine! - Forgive me maestro. - Why?! Watch out! Let's go. Sybil... It's all over now... You're free. No one will ever hurt you again. Corine... Is it you? No, I'm Christine... and I'm you. Yes. Two flames... We are two flames that burn as one. Yes, burning as one. You and I, always together. In the future, we can see so clearly. There is the most wonderful harmony. Even in the darkness, brightness. Yes Christine, even in darkness. I will always be with you. No one walks alone on this earth. It may be difficult to understand... but you must trust me. No one is alone. I'm her, but at the same time she's me. We'll meet one day. In the future. She said we should stay together. You don't believe it do you? Tell me you believe it. Of course I believe you. You were in some kind of trance. You saw something I couldn't see. But there was something there. I felt a presence. I couldn't see it, but I know it was there. I believe you Sybil. I love you so much. Maestro... Precious colour of life. I will live on.
