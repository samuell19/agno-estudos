Professor! Professor! Professor! No, we were at the Miller House, and now we're at the church. Yeah. It's good. That's nice. Yeah, I will. Yeah, later. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Well. Right. Great. First Christian is considered one of the first modernist churches in America. In the United States. Designed by Eliel Saarinen, and Christians consider... Notice how the cross and the doors and the clock are all off-centre. This design, Saarinen's design is asy... Saarinen's design is asymmetrical, yet still remains balanced. Here you go. All right. - There you are, hey. - Look, marginalia. Nice. Anything good? Not sure. Might just be grad student gibberish. If you do a database dive, let me know. Yeah, of course. What's up? Wanna catch a film tonight? I can't tonight, sorry. I'm having dinner with a friend in Bloomington. Like a date? No, no, it's just an old school friend. Mm-hm, whatever. Do you have your Master's? Sadly, yes. Was it hard to get? Depends on what you mean by hard. Why? I was just talking to Aaron, and he told me that as a rule they only give full-time positions to MLS grads. That's not completely true. Claire doesn't have one. She doesn't? She has a Ph.D. in Lit. Great. Yeah, whatever you do, don't get an MLS. It was recently declared the worst Master's for a job. Really? Yeah. And yet you have a job. Well, I'm an exception. Anyway, you don't want to be a librarian. I might. No, you don't. What about that Deborah Berke? You'd be crazy to pass that up. Yeah, that's not gonna happen. Why not? It's just not. You wouldn't understand. Yes, I would. What? Nothing. Come on, let's go see him first. I still can't believe how old you are. You look just the same. That's not true. - You do. - But thank you. You're sweet. So how do you like being back in Seoul? It's okay. What are you doing there? I got a job at a publisher, translating books into Korean from English. That sounds interesting. It is. Not. It's pretty painful, actually. I'm on deadline now. I just got off the phone with them. They don't expect you to work while you're here, do they? I think they do. You know, it's that Korean thing. We're so sorry. Family is the most important thing but really work is the most important thing. So, you better finish that fucking translation on time. That can't be true. We'll see. I wish you were staying another day. I know but I was supposed to be in Chicago a few days ago with your father. And I have my work. My husband. I know, you've already done so much. I can't believe this happened. He was doing fine and then just... I'm sorry. I just... I owe him so much. Your father means everything to me. Is there anything else I can get you guys? No, I think we're ready for the... Can I get another beer? Definitely. - Another glass of wine? - No, thanks. He didn't even tell me he was coming on this trip. Did he tell you that? No. That's about right. Did he mention me at all? We talked a little. What did he say? Jin. Did he tell you that we haven't spoken in over a year? You're all he has. That has never been the case. He has his students, his work. You're his son. You've been watching too much Korean drama. - Here you go. - Thank you. Can we have the cheque? Sure, I'll be right back. I have to leave so early in the morning. I should go to bed. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have brought that up. The Inn knows about the situation. You should be able to stay in his room as long as you need. Shit. Hey, are you expecting anyone? Do you know what he's doing on Sunday? No, I'll just drop you off in the morning and then take it over to Kenny's. It'll cost us more if it breaks down on us. Ugh, I hate cars. Me, too. I think this could use just a... bit more spice. You think it does? Maybe. I was going for something a little more subtle. I don't even know what that means. You know, less obvious. Why? Because sometimes you can taste the food better and then there's a better aftertaste. You crazy. You are. This is the Irwin Conference Centre, formerly the Irwin Union Bank. It was completed in 1954 and designed by Eero Saarinen, son of Eliel Saarinen, who designed First Christian Church. Now like the church, banks in the U.S. did not look like this in 1954. They were big, imposing buildings that had tellers behind bars. No, no, he's not saying it's an actual myth. He's just questioning this common usage of attention span. Or really this idea of a shortening attention span. So he doesn't think that this is happening? You're constantly talking about how no one can finish a book anymore. Yes, that's exactly the point. I'm bookish. We're both bookish. So what he's saying is that when we talk about attention we're biassed toward reading. Like, I had this professor who used to go on and on about the idiocy of video games. He talked about how his son would play for hours and that he once tried playing with him, but found it completely dull after just a few minutes. Now, if this was reversed, if the son was talking about how his dad would read for hours and he once tried reading with him, but found it boring, after a few minutes, well, he would accuse the son of having a short attention span, right? But why don't we accuse the professor of having a short attention span? Because it's not about attention for him. It just seems idiotic. But what if that's exactly the case for the son? See, what he's saying is that this boy is actually able to give hours of attention to a video game because it's interesting to him. Yeah, but that's because video games are designed for people with short attention spans. Yeah, see, that's what bookish people say. But no, what this guy is saying is it's not a matter of attention, but of interest. The professor doesn't have patience for the video game because he's not interested in that kind of experience. In the same way that the son might not be interested in books, and it's not that he doesn't have the ability to pay attention, clearly he does. Like the professor, he's able to pay attention for hours if he finds something interesting. So, down with books, long live video games? No, not at all. What he's offering is a critique of a critique. But in its place, he identifies a different kind of crisis. Not the crisis of attention, but the crisis of interest. See, to talk about attention is its own kind of distraction. Kids pay attention to things that interest them. The real question is what interests them? Or us? Are we losing interest in things that matter? Words on a page, for instance. Yeah, see, maybe that's not so important. What about everyday life? Are we losing interest in everyday life? You got all this from marginalia? Well, you know, he also filled all the blank pages in the back. Casey? - Emma, hey. - Hi. I was hoping to see you. Yeah, when did you get back? Oh, just a few days ago. I'm only here for a week. Really? My roommates and I, we're getting an apartment this year. It's gonna be so fun. We're all flying in early to set it up. Oh, it sounds great. Yeah, I can't wait. How was Amsterdam? Oh my God. It was the best. You have to go one day. Yeah. No, seriously, you would love it. The museums, they're incredible. Guys are so much more interesting. Yeah. And school, how is that going? I love it. Sophomore year was even better. LA is amazing. It already feels like home. I'll probably end up staying out there. Yeah. I mean, I can't imagine coming back here. Maybe Chicago. What about you? When are you leaving? To where? To school. To anywhere. Oh, I like Columbus. C'mon, Casey. No, I do. I mean, you of all people, should be in college. I'm not in any hurry. Well, you already missed a year. You can't keep putting it off. We need to get some book carts in the back. - Right, yeah. - You should listen to me. Emma, this is Gabe, Gabe, Emma. I went to high school with her. I was a year ahead, but we were still really close. She's like my little sister. I should probably get back to work. It was really nice to see you. Oh, wait text me, okay? - Let's hang out. - Yeah, okay. Actually, I'll take one, if you don't mind? - Yeah, sure. - Thank you. You speak English. You don't think Asians can speak English? Yeah, of course. No, yeah, I was just I heard you - speaking on the phone and... - Sorry, I'm being a jerk. You offered me a cigarette, and I'm giving you a hard time. I didn't mean to... I know what you meant. Sorry, I'm having a rough day. Or year. I saw you at the hospital. You did? Yeah, it was early in the morning. Sorry, I don't remember. Are you, I don't want this to sound offensive if you're not, but are you related to Jae Yong Lee? I am, I'm his son. How did you know that? I was planning to go to his talk. Ah. But it was cancelled obviously. We heard what happened. Is he okay? He's stable. Not enough to put on a plane. He's still unconscious. I'm really sorry. It's okay. My name's Casey. It's actually Cassandra, but everyone calls me Casey. Jin. Jim? Jin. With an n. Got it. Jin. Are you from here? Yeah, we moved here when I was four. Do you like it here? I do. How about you? Not sure yet. Do you like the Inn? Yes, it's quite fancy - think I might break something. It's not very modernist though, is it? No. Is that where your father... Yeah. See, it's asymmetrical but it's also still balanced. So, you were planning on going to my father's talk? Mm-hm. Are you familiar with his work? No, but I'm really interested in architecture. I've been to almost all the talks in the past few years. Yeah, I hear this town is quite the Mecca. I'm sure everyone here is fanatical about architecture, huh? Are you kidding? No, most people, they don't really have any idea. I mean, they know some things but they don't really give a shit. Is that right? Yeah, you'd be surprised how little people know or care about architecture here. Maybe not. What do you mean? I don't know shit about architecture or care. I don't believe you. It's true. I'm just like everyone here. You grow up around something, and it feels like nothing. Well, I never liked her. Oh, she's okay. She's a show-off. She's not. Don't start protecting her now. It's not like everybody can go to Monaco. Monaco? Amsterdam. Whatever. Oh, sorry, did I wake you up? No, I was up. Thought I'd get back in time. Thanks for taking the trash out. Doing my part. You want some eggs? We're out, I'm gonna have to go to the store later. Give me the butter, please? - Okay, thanks. - Have a good day. You, too, see you later. Hi, are you Christine? Hello. Hi, I'm here to turn in my applications. You have more than one? Yes, this one is for the part-time newsroom assistant and that is for the internship. Got it. Thank you. Do you know when we might hear something? It's hard to say but you're welcome to call back in a couple of weeks if you haven't heard from us. Thank you. Shit. Jin! Jin! Jin with an n! Jin. This is my second favourite building. Second? What's your first? The house I was mentioning. I'm gonna sign you up for a tour. It's the only way you can see it. Hm. But this is also by Eero Saarinen and it sort of resembles a house. What do you know about it? This was one of the first modernist banks in America. You can imagine at the time that walking into an all-glass bank was quite unusual. Radical, really, 'cause during that time banks were designed to be imposing, fortress-like, with tellers behind bars. The idea here was that you walk in at street level. You don't have to climb any stairs. It's inviting. Sorry, what? What are you doing? What? Who are you? Shut up. I'm just trying to tell you about this building. Okay, stop with the tour guide mode for a second. I'm not in a mode. You said this is one of your favourite buildings. - It is. - Why? It's one of the first modernist banks - in the United States. - No, no, that can't be it. Do you like this building intellectually because of all the facts? No. I'm also moved by it. Yes, yes, tell me about that. What moves you? I thought you hated architecture? I do but I'm interested in what moves you, particularly about a building. But wouldn't you get tired of it? No, not at all. And I'd get to interact with all these interesting people from all over the world. The problem with being a tour guide is that you stop seeking. You become some arbiter of tidbit facts that you start repeating over and over. You'd hate it. Take this walkway, then you'll go through the building and you'll see signs for the main hospital on the other side. I like this building. - Isn't it great? - Yeah. It's a little rundown, but it's still great. Can I tell you something? What? I know a bit about Polshek and this building. You do? Yeah, he had this idea, Polshek did, of architecture being this sort of healing art. That it had the power to restore and that architects should be responsible. - Do you mind if I... - For the tour? No. Anyway, all the details of this building are mindful of that responsibility, especially since it was a structure for mental health. This building was meant to be both a literal and metaphoric bridge. Polshek had the same idea for the Clinton Library. Did your dad tell you all this? No. I think he was planning on writing something about Polshek, but then he found out that Polshek was writing his own book. It came out very recently. And you read it? Some of it, the part about this building. And you don't care about architecture? I skimmed it, it was in my father's room when I got here. Wait, so you you just recently read about this building? Yes, does that matter? No, I guess not. You're funny. Hey. What are you doing tonight? I'm hanging out with my mom. Well, I'm free. So? So, let's do something. Did you not hear me? Wait, are you getting me back for the other night? What? When I hung out with my friend. No. Why would I? God, I can't believe you have a Master's degree. And don't forget it. Of course, it's the worst degree you can get. Better than no degree. Nice. Hey, I was just joking. I know. C'mon, we were just joking. You just called my degree the worst. Yeah, I know, we're good. We're fine, just leave me alone and never talk to me again. Have fun without me. Hey, should I hang out with you and your mom tonight? Seriously? Yeah. No, never. You sure? - No, goodbye. - All right. Mom? Mom, it's me, call me back. Hey, I know you're at work, but I'm just checking in. Call me, okay? Hey, sweetie. I have to get back in a second, but your mom's fine. Yeah, I've been trying to get a hold of her all night. Her phone's out of charge. Okay. Why couldn't she come out? We have a supervisor with us tonight. You know, we're not supposed to have visitors or phone calls or texts. Sorry, I was worried. I told her I'd run out. You know how she is. Yeah, okay, sorry, I hope you're not gonna get in trouble. I'll be fine, but I should head back up. Okay, could you just tell her that I'm gonna pick her up tonight? No, sweetie, I'll give her a ride. She wanted me to tell you that. Okay, she wants you to rest. I gotta go. Hey. What's going on? I want to show you something. It's late. I think I should probably not. It's not even midnight. You're such an old man. C'mon. It's number three on my list. Number three, really? Mostly because it was the beginning for me. You know? This one here? Yep. And you didn't know anything about it? Nothing. I just saw it from over there. I'd probably seen it a thousand times before but this one night, I was getting in my car and I looked up and saw it. So I jumped back in the car and drove up here. Same spot and I just stared at it for a really long time. What was it? Not sure. It had to have been something. Well, it was a pretty miserable time in my life. When you mentioned the whole healing thing it sort of made me think of that moment. I don't know if I believe that, you know? That architecture has the power to heal. I think that's a fantasy that architects like to tell themselves. Or people like my father. People who are invested in architecture, you know? I wasn't claiming to be healed. I'm sorry, I wasn't trying to be dismissive. You were telling me it was a miserable time in your life. What was going on? I don't really want to talk about it. I just wanted you to see this building. Please, tell me. - Cassie... - I just need a cigarette. Cassandra? Can you pass me those? Thank you. You know, meth is a big thing here; meth and modernism. Meth is big everywhere. Even in North Korea. Really? Yeah. In China. Everywhere. Huh. Were you addicted to meth? No. Your mother? Does she do meth? What? Sorry. That just sounds funny. Funny, how? "Your mother, did she do meth?" What? You don't hear it? Hear what? "Your mother, did she do meth?" What? "Your mother, did she do meth?" I don't... Never mind. So, did she? Did she what? You know? No, no, I don't, what are you asking? Did your mother do meth? That was even worse. So she didn't? No, she did. But it was just 'cause this shit-head guy cheated on her. That's her real addiction, shit-heads. Sorry. Yeah, it got really bad after the last shit-head. The worst, really. When was this? How old were you? 15, 16. Sorry. There were nights that my mom just wouldn't come home at all. I had no clue where she was. That's when I started coming here. I found it weirdly comforting. In the middle of all the mess, in this fucking strip mall there was this... This... I don't know. I sort of weirdly became obsessed with this building after that. That's when I discovered Deborah Berke, who designed it. And I learned about Saarinen, whom she adores, and just started reading all this stuff. Suddenly the place I'd lived my whole life felt different like I had been transported somewhere else. God, Dad would've loved you. Yeah? Yeah. And you don't? So things got better? Sort of. Yeah, I mean slowly. It was hard. It was really hard for a long time. We sort of hit bottom before my mom was willing to do anything. It got ugly. Just. I'd rather not talk about it. I met Deborah Berke last year. Really? Yeah, the Museum brought her into town to discuss the Miller House. She was amazing. I sort of followed her around, like a little fan girl and we actually hung out a few times, but no big deal. Yeah, she told me I should come out to New Haven. To Yale? No. No. She thought I could get into the University of New Haven. She had some connections there. She also said I could audit some of her classes at Yale. Maybe even intern at her firm in New York. Really? You want to become an architect? I don't think so. I never really thought about it until she brought it up. But you'll go, right? No. We don't have the resources and I really think I should stay with my mom. She's doing really well. We're happy. I just think I should stay here. So he built this 22 years later? Was the father still alive? Uh, no. Er, I don't know. Eliel died in 19... when was it? Let me check. No, don't! Don't, give me a second. No, stop! Seriously. Eliel died in 19... 1950. Yeah, so he was he was definitely dead. Yes. 1950. The tour guide nails it. I don't even know why you wasted your data. - Waste my data? - Never mind. Smart phone, dumb human. So, you never use your phone? For phone calls. Right. I have a dumb phone, no internet. That's not even possible. What? I search plenty of things on the computer. Does this make you feel better than everybody else? Hardly. You'd love Eleanor, by the way. She was probably a lot like you when she was younger. Yeah? How so? You know an architecture nerd. Oh, is that what I am? Yes. Really? Without a doubt. Hm. Go on. Well, Eleanor was telling me about my dad's latest research. He was writing something on the Saarinen churches. Really? Like what? I'm not sure exactly. Something about the paradox of modernism and religion. That's interesting. I suppose. Are you religious? No. I think religions are like monarchies. There might be a good king here and there but the system is problematic. Too easy to exploit. So you're anti-monarchy? Yes. Isn't everyone? You'd be surprised. What about your dad? Does he believe in anything? He believes in modernism. Modernism with a soul. I like that. I don't know what it means, but he used to say it all the time. Something about an alternative possibility. What are you doing? Just checking to see if this might be it. It's not. What? Take a look at this. What do you think it is? Those lines? I don't know. They could be anything. But it sort of looks like a tower, right? Yeah, I guess. It's not this. What's this mean? It's just fragments that says much ado about nothing. Nothing underlined. What's over here? With the exclamation point? That just says "yes". It says: Effort plus cost to see what is invisible and always visible. No, omni-visible. No, always visible. Always. Wow. I should ask Gabe at work. He's really into these kind of riddles. Yes, yes, what the fuck? My father was always trying to be so profound. Why wouldn't he just the write the name down or draw a better picture? Well, I didn't think he thought someone was ever gonna read this. He probably knew exactly what he meant. It's still fucking annoying. Can I ask you something? Maybe. Why aren't you at the hospital? Nothing's changed, you know? If I were there right now, it would be just like the last time I saw him. He'd just be lying there. Why should I just stare at him all day? You could talk to him. This isn't the movies, nothing's gonna happen. You know, there's been research. I don't want to talk to him. We never talked. He was never interested. Why should I bother him now? Do you think he's got a chance to recover? Even if it's just enough to go back to Seoul? God. I hope not. What? The truth is, if I were in Korea I'd be expected to be there when he died and to express sorrow in the most dramatic fashion. There's this belief that if you're not there when a family member dies and not adequately grieving, your spirit will roam aimlessly and become a kaekkwi. A ghost. Of course, my dad didn't believe in that shit but, still, it would be expected of me. Do you believe in it? No. But if you were in Korea, you'd go along with it. Probably. So, what? You don't want him to get better? Maybe not. Hm. Oh. That's so sad. I think your mom was right. Are you just trying to get back at me for talking about your dad? No, I've been thinking about it since you told me. What she says makes sense. Stop. You have no idea. You're bright. You can do a lot. You should go to New Haven, take her up on her offer. What offer? What offer? She was being nice, and I blew it up in my head. And I don't even want to go. I can't. You said your mom wants you to go. Yeah. She just feels guilty and she doesn't know what it would mean. Give your mom some credit, huh? I can't believe you're lecturing me. I'm not lecturing you. I'm not lecturing you! You quit grad school, right? That is different. That is completely different and... The reason I'm telling you this and the reason your mother is telling you this is because you're smart and talented. You could do a lot better! Than what? Taking care of my mom? You obviously don't get that, do you? Because you're here hoping that your dad dies so you don't have to mourn for him. I should go. It is one of the most significant attempts at modern romantic architecture in the world. Table that mimics the one outside. - Where's the fountain? - Inside. In the table. A statue of Henry Moore's Draped Reclining Woman used to reside on this plinth up here but there was an auction one day and Oprah bought it. And over here to the right, we have a second century... Can you do the translation work in his room? I just think you should be there whenever possible. I'm there a lot. It makes a difference, Jin, it does. I think you'd really like her. She sounds great. She's a mini-version of you. I mean, she's not smaller, she's younger. Oh, I get it. How old did you say she was? Um, I don't know, 19, 20. You like her? I think she's... Well, what do you mean? What do you mean? Do you like her, like her? How old are you? You do, don't you? You need to pull back on that wine. You love her. First of all, she's way too young. Ah, wait, weren't you 18 when you declared your love to me? Or was it 17? Shut up. I never did that. Ah, you did. I didn't. Maybe you didn't use the word love but... Aw, you were so sweet. God, I was hoping that never happened. It did. I just, I hoped it was in my imagination. "Eleanor, I want you to know that I think you're..." What did you say? What was it? I was admittedly a little naive. No, you were sweet. I always thought you were adorable. Just young. Very serious. I was, what? I was 20. Yes. I did have an agonising crush on you. God, you were like... You look just like your dad right now. No. Please. No. - Eleanor. - No, you have to go. I can't do this. You have to leave. More glass. More glass. Transparency. Light. This is number five on my list. - Woo-hoo! - Shh. Look at the dummy! - Ssh! - Who are you calling? Just give me a second. Hi, Vanessa, it's Casey. Sorry to bother you, but I'm just trying to get a hold of my mom again. I want her to know that I will definitely pick her up in the morning. Can you tell her that? Thanks, bye. Are you fucking kidding me? You okay? Oh, hi. Sorry, I was just gonna leave another message. Yeah. Yes, I forgot that she told me that. That's why I was calling back. Okay, got it, so you'll drive her. Hey, did my mom's phone die again? Yeah, that's what I thought. Can I talk to her for a second? I see. Okay, well, tell her I said hey. Okay, thanks. Everything okay? Casey, what's the matter? Do you wanna go to a party? What? My friend Emma invited me to a party. We could still make it. No, I don't want to go to a party. Yeah, you do. Agh! ♪ Your lips are moving but I don't hear a sound ♪ ♪ And if you hang up I'll still see you around ♪ ♪ I know you've been out 'cause you don't look alright ♪ ♪ But come on baby ♪ ♪ It's time to eat the night ♪ ♪ They see you coming ♪ ♪ They all know you by name ♪ What are you doing? Oh, nothing. Did I miss the party? What party? Didn't you say we were going to a party? Oh, right. No, I wanted to come here instead. Where are we? Nowhere! What is this? This is where I went to school. That's brutal. Want to check it out? I know how to get inside. You do? - Ssh. - What? I thought I heard something. Why aren't you answering your phone? We need to get to the hospital. What's going on? I don't know. There's been some complications. We need to go. Let me get my phone. Hurry up! What's going on? Oh, hey I need to go to the hospital. Is everything okay? I don't know. Cassandra? Oh, hi. What are you doing here? Uh, I was just visiting someone. Here? Yeah, we have a guest that's giving a talk at the library. Oh, I heard that you're working there. I am, I love it. So how's your mom doing? She's great. Good, good. I heard she's doing much better. Yeah. And she's still working at the factory? Yeah, she is. It's part-time, she's almost at 30 hours now. She's doing some night cleaning, too, but it's temporary. Oh, yeah, that's, I'm so happy to hear that, Cassandra. And when will you be graduating? I graduated last year. Oh, that's good. - Are you going to... - I really better get going. Sorry. Okay, well, tell your mom, hi. Yeah, I will. - Nice to see you. - Bye. Where have you been? Cassandra, what's wrong? What am I gonna do? What do you mean? How long do I stay here and just wait? As long as it takes. So I just wait until he dies? Or recovers. He's not gonna recover. Whatever happens, you need to wait. I do? If he dies, you don't want him to die alone. - I don't? - You don't. It doesn't seem fair. He never paused his life for me. I know this is hard. I'm so sorry. So along with the music room, the front parlour was designed for receiving and entertaining guests. It was also meant to showcase the family's art collection. The Millers were more serious collectors than any generation before them. In fact, the art collection that was stored here and at the Miller House sold in auction through Christie's in 2008. It was the largest collection of impressionistic.... Like you said, it's better than what you thought, though. But it's a pattern. This guy's from work, maybe he's the one? I doubt that. Haven't met him. I'm tired of meeting new guys. I'm just tired. Then accept Eleanor's offer. My mom would be lost without me. Yeah. Maybe. Will you pass me one of those? Yeah. You want one? Where does this building rank on your list? This? Mm-hm. I don't know probably late teens, 20's. Hm. I think this is what my dad's referring to. That? Yes. Hm. If it's not, I'm gonna say that it is. Walk along the storage walk and let you take a look. This table here, was designed by Alexander Gerard. The design of it is the same design that he put on the curtains in the children's area. Hm. It's pretty, huh? Yeah. And he also picked out all the pillow textiles. - Hm. - I love this area. It's bright. And there's a fountain that shoots up in the middle of the dining table and it sort of mimics the fountain out in the backyard. - Oh, yeah. - Yeah. Jin? Jin? I can't believe you're leaving. Me, neither. It'll be good for you. That's what people keep saying. It's true. I should probably go. Wanna know something? What? I don't really smoke. Shut up. It's true. I just liked hanging out here with you. Yeah. I should probably stop. I better go, my mom's waiting for me. Last dinner. Yeah. Want me to join you? I think that was your best dinner yet, missy. So subtle. That wasn't subtle. But it was good, though, thank you. What am I gonna do without your dinners? Hm? Use the microwave. Oh, that's exactly what I'll be doing. I made you a list of recipes, don't forget. Use them, okay? I really wish that we'd done more things together. You know? Like taken a trip together or something. I really can't believe we never did that. Not even once. Mom. You shouldn't... We were... It was... Oh God, it must have been so hard growing up with me. I'm so sorry, Casey. Mom, no, it wasn't. I love being with you. I don't even know why I'm leaving, honestly. I just want to stay here with you. Mom. Mom. Mom? How's the apartment? It's not the Inn. Well, nothing's the Inn. Is it bearable? No complaints. It's actually nice. I like the neighbourhood. It's a week-to-week? Month-to-month. That's still good. Thanks - for everything. Thank you for being here. I hope my mom's gonna be okay. She's gonna be all right. She wants this for you. Casey, she's so proud of you. I feel bad leaving you, too. You gotta keep me posted, okay? I will. But you need to stop feeling bad. Yeah, so do you. Maybe. Think I'm gonna quit smoking. Yeah? Yeah. It's probably a good idea. She's not a fan. You better get going. I know.
