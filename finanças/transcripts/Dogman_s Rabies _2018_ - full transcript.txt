Rabies is a lethal viral disease that is transmitted to animals and humans. The infection occurs through the saliva of infected animals and evolves in three phases. The most terrible is called FURIOUS RABIES. Fear the anger of the meek for they shall give back to you everything that they have suffered.. (The Bible, the Book of Revelation) - Hey! - Hey, man! A little bit of music? God, I missed this fresh air. My friend... Do you remember? How can I forget? First time we got caught by the police. We almost went to jail for nothing. Fuck them! - We were just kids. - Yes, we were. Fabio, I'm not the one who forget. You are not a friend to me, you are a brother! Now let's go say hi to our friends! No, no! I have to go home to my wife and my daughter. I need to get rid of this jail smell. I can't take it anymore! Come on! You can go home later. Let's go to our friends, you've been in jail for 8 months. Just to strut around a little bit. Come on, let's go! - I don't know! - Oh, come on! Let's go! Marco has 90 stikers... the day after he goes to the newsstand... and... then goes to... Come on, Silvia, hurry up! Otherwise we'll never end up. And buys... 10 packs. Pacs without the k? Packs, Silvia! Mom? When daddy gets home, can we go buy the hoverboard? Didn't you want new skates? Daddy promised he would buy me the hoverboard. Don't trust your dad promises. Write down! - This sucks! It's too much stuff. - Hey you! - I've got all summer! - I told you not to say bad words! - I've got all summer to do my homework! - You are... such a stubborn! Give me your hands! Come on! Write down! - Come on! Hurry up! - Packs? Full stop. Keep going on your own. - Are you poking in? - No! Pain in the ass? Yeah! Hey, guys! My friend just came back from war! He has been to the frontline, he's a hero! So, to the Unknown Warrior! Thank you all! Thanks! But now I wanna go to my place. Are you serious? We throw a party... you're the guest of honour and you wanna leave us like that? You can't do this to us! - It's really a slight, Fabio! - Yeah! Romolo, more booze! No, he's the guest of honour! Come on, Fabio! Let's drink our fill! Here's to you! - Cheers! - Cheers! Thank you! Thank you! Here's a present from your friend! What is this? Your shop's keys. I cleaned it up. Are you kidding me? Come on, Fabio! No! I'm done with that shit! No, no, he's joking! Did the jail make you wimp? Come, on. Take it! It's better not! Come on! Just like the old days. Maybe... See? Look what I did! Wow! It's beautiful! Come on! Let's go inside! - Where are the keys? - I gave you them before, no kidding! Yes, that's right! - What the fuck... - What? You can no longer find holes? Oh my God! You needed a new life, and I gave it to you. Thank you, Claudio! Do you remember? It was all messed up, look at it now! It's beautiful! - I can't wait to tell my wife. - You're going to tell her right now. - I'll drive you home. - Let's go! The door! - You're totally wasted! - No! - No? - I'm fine! Yeah, of course! Maybe drink a little bit more. Hey, you! Hello buddy, how are you? Hey! I'm back home! I see you! Didn't you leave jail this morning? I just got home and we're already fighting? I went to greet my friends, can I? Of course, you can! - Why not? - Fine. - I haven't just seen you in a year. - A year? It's a long time! God, you stink! What did you drink? At least Claudio came and pick me up. You didn't want me there. Anyway, you were busy with your friends. You had plans with Claudio, so he could take the piss out of you. Claudio is like a brother to me. Yes, sure. A brother. No, actually, look what he did. Shit! Which one... Oh yes, this one with the bone. Look! He cleaned up our shop. Take them. - The keys with a bone? - Yes. They're for the dog. Yeah... You're such a jerk! Where's Silvia? She fell asleep in our bedroom. - On our bed. - On our bed? Now you're going to sleep on the couch. - On the couch? - Yes. On my own? No, I'm not! Instead, exactly on your own. On your own! Welcome back! A new shop... - Gianni? - Yes? We got the report from the Animal Control. And so? They found other dog remains still around the old pit. Of course even these have no microchip. Unfortunately not. They take off the microchip from every dog! Bastards! - Thank you, Lo Russo! - My duty. - Hi, Claudio! - Hi, Cencio! Let's fix this total drag. - Holidays are over, aren't they? - Hey, how you doing? - You look a bit peaky. - You're right. The food in jail was shit. - You look nice, anyway. - Thanks, you too. Let's grab a coffee, a real one. Do you see what he did? It was the least he could do. He got you thrown in jail without lifting a finger. You always think the worst! Come on, let's go grab this coffee. Somebody told me there were problems with my dog. - Where the fuck is Mario? - Hold on, I'll call him. Mario! On the ball! Mario, no bullshit! What happened with Black? Where is he? - Nothing, just a fucking accident. - I said no bullshit! Where's my dog? What's this mess? What the fuck is going on? His dog Black left his cage, he went into Diablo's and they fought. And nothing had happened, right? Make some coffee. - Is Black your dog? - Yes! He's a great dog. I'm Spartaco. I'm Claudio. Come on, let's have a bath! Good boy... It's okay. I got it. Look at me! Remember, when they entrust us with their dogs... be very careful... and make sure this never happens again! You need to be very careful... Now go free Black! Go! I heard you're a badass, I might need you. Now go get your dog, then I'll let you know. Milù! Come to your mom! - She looks brand-new, doesn't she? - Thanks, Fabio. You turned her into cotton candy! - You can pay me next time. - No, no! - I don't like debts. - You said it. - I have to pay you right now. - Thank you! - Milù thanks you too. - I know it! Look at her! She thinks she's all that! We've already seen your butt, now show us the rest! You wish! Hey, baby! How much cool you feel? - What happened? War wounds? - No, training ones. Make sure to do a good job. Claudio cares about him. Okay! Get out now. I have to work. Speaking in Rumanian. What the fuck are you laughing at? She's all naked, look at her boobs! - Do you wanna see real boobs? - Let me see! There you go... Look at these ones! - Who's that? - Go see! - Who's that? - Holy shit! I think it's the police. What the fuck! Shut up! Be quiet! Come with me! Come on, buddy. You'll be awake soon. Who the fuck is now? The cops are here! I got it! Come in! Come here! - Wait right here! Don't move! - Yes! - Hi, De Nardis! - Good morning, Chief! I just got out and you're already here! They did a great job while you were in jail. My friends helped me. - They're very generous. - Well, they're friends. There's the pay-off. I don't know what you're talking about, but you're mistaken! My friends helped me and my family. There's nothing wrong! Come on! Let me in! So, Fabio, do you know anything about these? Take a good look at them. What's these? They are dog used in fighting. - I don't make dog fight! I wash them! - Don't try to be funny! It seems to be a gang that smuggles in these underground fighting. They might be some Neapolitans just arrived nearby. - You know nothing? - No, I don't! Besides, people who make dog fight make me sick. Of course! - Stop! Wait! - What the fuck! - What's over there? - The back room. Chief, the workmen finished this morning, the cement is still wet. Stupid asshole... Fine! But if you find out something, please let me know. Okay! Stay out of trouble! See you! Go fuck yourself! I know you're trying to get busy, but it's not my era anymore... I was a refugee, and I couldn't find a good job... sometimes working as a background actor in western... or sometimes getting busy in other ways... I got by! But in this district there were different rules... now everyone is tearing you apart. I just wanna worry about my family. Do you know any thieves who got rich? I don't know! Sheriff, I just don't want my daughter to grow up here. Do you understand? I want the best for her. You have to watch out! These people don't mess around. They fool you in a second, even those who pretend to be friends. - Sheriff, I brought two biscuits... - Great! I want this one. Very good! Oh my God, it's late! I have to pick up Silvia at the pool. Go! Don't worry, I got it! I owe you one! - Hi, sweetheart! - Hi, daddy! - Have you been waiting a long time? - No, just a little bit. - I'm sorry! - It's okay. I had stuff to do at the shop. It's fine! - Do you forgive me? - Of course I do! Honey, let's go quickly for an ice cream so then I can go to work at the shop. I came by the shop, but you weren't there. Why? I waited for you till the last, then I had to come pick her up. This is the thanks I get for helping you with the shop? Not even a little respect... What's that got to do with it? It's okay, honey. Your dad and I are just kidding. I'm like an uncle for you. I saw you born. I'll come by again at 6 o'clock. You'd better be there. He's joking. - Hi, Claudio! - Finally! We were supposed to meet at 6! - So what? - So, it's a quarter to 5. Well, I'm supposed to be here at 6, but you have to come earlier. - Well, let's go talk inside. - No, no. Let's stay out here. You did a great job with Black, he's a good dog, a champion. - Well done! - Thanks! - Anyway I wanted to help him. - Yeah, yeah of course... - I can't pay you, you know that? - Okay, no problem. - And I also need... - I got it! Well. What's the rush to open this fucking shop? I'm talking to you! Fabio, are you okay? - What have you done to him? - Sheriff, mind your own business... I am minding my own business! I've seen this boy grow up! And if you want to keep doing that, just mind your own, fucking, business! See you tonight at the warehouse. Don't be late! Cencio, let's go. Fabio, are you all right? He is nobody! He didn't mean it... Don't stand up for him, that son of a bitch! Well, Sheriff, see you. Now, let's dry you up! What do you think? Do you like it? Do you like it? - Haven't seen much of you lately. - You know, I just spent 8 months in jail! You got the snow? Listen, are you interested in a very easy deal? Only if there are no pickles! Tell me. That's good stuff! High-end people, a big thing. Yes, I'm in! Call this number. - Bye! - See you! Hi, Fabio! I've something for Claudio. There he is. - Hey, Claudio! - Hey, man! For you! You're great, Fabio! Thank you, my friend! You're welcome. So... do you want my money? You said you couldn't pay me off. Well, I did a couple of odd jobs, I've got some money. Never mind, it's a gift! Okay. Come on. Come on and see how my champion took back. No, I don't know. But if he got back, it's thanks to you too. I know it, but I don't like seeing dogs fight together. Okay. Do the fuck you want, but you're insulting me. Come on, maybe next time. Okay. Hey jerk, tomorrow you'll offer again. You know what I mean. Hi! Hi! I tried to call you so many times but your phone was always off. I'm sorry but I had a lot to do at the shop. All the dogs of Mandrione district had a bath tonight. Of course. I said I'm sorry, what the fuck should I do? I work hard in people's houses, then I get home and I start it over. No Saturdays or Sundays. You don't bring me for a walk anymore, or to watch a movie to the cinema... or to get an ice-cream. You are worse than my father. Yeah, such a good man. He ran off when you were 5 and you got a tattoo for him on your arm. You're such an idiot. You're right, I'm an idiot. I keep waiting for you for dinner and I keep loving you... YOU, that you don't even have the money to pay the bills. Just eat, it'll get cold. There are entrails inside, too. Why are you still awake? I'm at the end of the story! The end? It's always the same. The prince kisses the princess with areal loving kiss... and they lived happily ever after. You're all sweaty. It's hot! Why are you covered? Come on! Now give it to me. Give me the good-night kiss. Hey mom, do you and dad give each other a real loving kiss? Always the same nosey, Silvia! You're a mess! Go to sleep! There is a lot of ground to manage. The summer will put a strain on the fire department... Hi Bea! Come here honey... How are you? A nice dry! Pizza-Mania! Pizza-Mania! What do we got today? Can I have a slice of that? So, did you get the money? No, I didn't have enough time. No money for today. I got it... Hi, Claudio! Look how all is clear and tidy. It seems my sister's home! Do people really buy this stuff? Yes, they do. Really? Can't believe it. Come on, Claudio. Even the faggot bow? Try it on. You can put it on to go out on Sunday. And this? Come on, eat it! - What the fuck are you doing? - What the fuck am I doing? If you have this stuff is because of me. It's because of me. It's because of me! Take out the snow, I know you have it. Tidy it up later. Come here. Oh God. You have to understand me if I'm a little harsh. Do you understand, right? Yes I understand, but I just tidied up, what the fuck! You know. I have a reputation in the district. If we are too kind, people think we are faggot. Take care. What do you want, mum? Don't answer like this, or I will slap you. - Which one of these I have to iron? - I don't know, I'm busy now. I can't iron them all! Make up your mind! I'll choose later! I'm busy now! I'll choose quietly, I have an important business meeting today. Business meeting? Of course, business meeting. Hey dad, you always understood me. And you were also very good at punching. Here you are. They said you wanted to see me. How did the week go? All right, everyone has paid. - Some of them didn't pay on time. - Didn't they pay on time? I don't really understand, so didn't they pay on time? Some people need to be encouraged. Some people need to be encouraged, and what about the barman? - I gave him a couple punches. - A couple punches?! He had a heart attack and you talk about a couple punches? - I lightly touched him. - I lightly touched him... Listen boy, I don't want to get involved with the police here, all right?! All right. Now get the fuck out of my face. I'm busy. Bye. Who the fuck does he think he is? He's pissing me off. In fact I wanted to tell you, he treated you really bad. No one treats me had. I got it. Shut this fucking dog up! - Hello, It's De Nardis. - Well, Ranieri is waiting for you. Follow me, please. Please, this way. Please. - Wait here, please. - Thank you. - Good evening. - Fabio, take a seat. Please. Well, let's get to the point. There's a big load to spread. It's a brand new recipe, just prepared and it needs to be tasted. - We start from your area. - Of course, I got it. It has to be spread well and quickly. Okay, what is it about? It's strong stuff, better than pure cocaine. It has no smell, no taste, it's water soluble, the effects are similar to those of the cocaine. It can get you an incredible power, but sometimes it can even kill you. My men will get in touch with you sooner. Would you like something to drink, sir? Never mind, Lorenzo. He was about to leave. Thank you, I'm just leaving. - Goodbye. - Make sure you... What are you looking at? Yes I drank a little, what's wrong? Nothing. This is all in your mind. Give me a kiss, a real love kiss. So let's make Silvia happy. What do you mean? - Nothing, it's about women... - Come on be serious. I'm in the middle of a deal... lot of money. - You scare me. - No, I'm serious. So much money... That this time I take you away. I swear. You scare me even more. No... You don't have to be scared. It's all right, we'll get out of here. - Do you promise? - I do. - Don't deceive me, I could believe you. - Come on, don't be like that. - I believe you Fabio, understand? - I know. Come on, go to sleep now. Fabio. Be careful this time. Don't listen to anybody. Come on. Get down. Like that. Claudio! Have a look... Here's where they come to bet real money... They bet on my dogs because they are the strongest. - I know, they always win. - Exactly, they always win. But tonight I'll have an important meeting with a man from Turin... he's full of money and he will bet on one of my dogs. - But he has to lose. - So, we give him an unfit dog. A really nice dog... but a loser. - I don't have unfit dogs. - I'll find something for you. Good morning. Come in, come in. Ranieri is waiting for news in a week. Listen, how do I... Here you'll find all the instructions to prepare the doses. - Okay. - Remember. No more than a week. Got it. Not bad... - Hi, Pierpaolo! - Hi! - Hey, guys! - Hi! - What's up? - All right. Today is your lucky day. We need your dog. Forget it, he's my friend. - We're doing you a favour. - Forget about it! Really? Let's go... I said I need your dog! And if I say so... ...it means I need, your fucking, dog! Shut up! Come on, hurry up! Assholes! Fucking assholes! - Hey Fabio! - I'm over here! Help me out here, come on! - What have you done? - Why? - Did you sniff? - Of course not! Put him down. Down here, well done. Slowly... Like that... Take the microchip off and stitch him quickly. He has to lose. - Even this one? - Yes! - Isn't it Foglia's dog? - No, he isn't. Fuck off! - It was only a question, get a grip! - No, he isn't his dog! What did you give him? He is already sleeping. Just a bit of sleeping pill, don't worry about it! Ok, now stand over there and let me work in peace! - Please do a good job. - Hey, just calm down... Let me do my job. Good boy. Like that. Well done, buddy. Where is it? Here it is. - Is everything okay? - Yes. - Have you finished? - Yes, I have. Nice, I call Cencio and we bring him to Spartaco. Okay. I won't let you die. Fuck them all. Be kind. Come on, champ! Like that. - Come on, Cencio! - Here I am. Put this on him. - How should I take him? - What? Okay, piss off! Come on dog, stand up! Up! Up! Up! It's useless talking to you! Get out of my face! You're welcome! If I catch you sleeping again while we are working, I'll hurt you very very much. Come on. Let's go. Are you the one who bet a lot of money on my dog? - Yes, it's me. - Well done! - Your friend is pretty cute. - I always want the best. We have to win tonight. - I don't want to stay here. - Just wait a moment. Do you see how weak he is? The first one to laugh loses. Look what you have done. Can you explain me how did you do? I already told you... I was in the shop and I hurt my hand with that thing. So maybe you got an infection and you'll have to get a tetanus shot. I take care of myself. I can't talk to you anymore, Fabio. You're not the same. I would like to see you after a year in that shit-hole. Okay. - Dad, does it really hurt? - No, it's all right. Take it. - Take the pill and go get some sleep. - Stop it, don't be like my mother! Sure, I'll stop. Let's go sweetheart. Dad wants to be left alone. - Did you see? - That's all luck... - That's not luck at all! - Don't you see he is unfit? Be quiet. I recommend you, do a good job ok? What are you doing...? Have you stopped? Finish it! You really let me down, Fabio. Someone told me that you are not working as you promised. - Who told you that is a... - Shut up! I didn't ask anything impossible. That stuff must not be cut or bagged it only has to be dissolved in water, even a child could do it. Why are you unable? - Are you some kind of retarded? - Mr. Ranieri... I may not be that smart... but I have a family, a job, and a week is not enough. I don't care. You must respect the deals. I gave you a chance, but you're not proving me your worth. Beggars can't be choosers, you have no choice. If you fail, I will hold you solely responsable. I expect great results. Trust me. I'll give you ten days, not a day more. What do you see? Rome! What is Rome? A huge cake. And if you behave yourself, a piece will be yours. I have other plans for you. Thank you. Listen, take off those photos. I don't want theme to see them. But they're coming here! Do you really think they don't know we're onto them? Lo Russo. Certainly, Chief... Come in! Good evening, Chief. - Good evening. - Detective. C'mon, sit down. Spit out your gum! - I'll be right back. - Okay. - So? - What's new, Detective? I'm the Chief, not Detective. However, I ask the questions, not you. - We're clean. - Do you know anything about that? I know nothing. I see a lot of ugly mugs and dogs. And what about this? - Get this stuff out of my face! - Don't play dumb with me, Claudio. There is a Neapolitan's gang that set up a big deal and they're making a mess. - Neapolitans? - Neapolitans! - I swear. We had nothing to do with it. - Right, of course. Don't you know anything either? Hey, I'm talking to you! - Not at all. - Of course. And this one? Isn't it your dog? Wasn't he a champion of underground fighting? Wish it was my dog, I'd make a lot of money with him. Claudio, I said don't piss me off. It's also really warm today. I know for sure you are involved too. And I'm sure your friend, De Nardis, is helping you too. - You mean "Er Canaro" (the groomer)? - Exactly. He is not helpful even when we play trump... But he was in jail for eight months. That's a truly token of friendship. - What do you mean? - What do I mean? We have found some dog remains around the old pit. They were all there and without microchip. Exactly. But this time someone made a mistake because we found a microchip. It was close to a dog remain. So, how about that? I already told you I'm clean. - I think you want to frame me tonight. - No! Next time tell me if you want to accuse me so I'll bring my lawyer. I don't want to accuse you of anything for now. I'm just telling you... to be very careful, Claudio. Because I keep an eye on you! And on you too. And now get out of here, come on! Let's go, Cencio. Bastards... Go I. Russo, see you tomorrow! We have to stake out on Canaro. We'll come up with something. Come on, go to sleep. In Rome you can't sleep in this heat. Hello? Hello, Patricia! Yes, I'm dad. How are you? I didn't want to talk with mom. No, I mean... why is so unusual to ask my daughter to spend a weekend together? Fine. I will call you another time. Okay. Bye sweetheart. Did you see what Foglia's dog did? - A mess. - Yeah. Spartaco is really pissed off now. - Can I have some water? - Of course. There's a dog's bowl if you want to drink. What? What is it? - What you said? - Leave me alone! You have to leave me alone. Don't you fuck with me! Leave him alone, okay? - Today is not the day, right Fabio? - True. Don't overdo it, guys. No, don't overdo yourself, old man. Thank God if I'm letting you keep breathing. The fuck are you doing?! You have to thank God if I'm letting you still walking. FUCKING DICKHEAD! What are you doing? Again? Even today? You are destroying our bar. Everyday the same story, that's enough! Come inside! Fuck off! Thank God and those few hairs you have on your head left if I'm letting you keep breathing. You cannot let this people walk all over you. They are like beasts! It's over if they find out that you're afraid. If only they were beasts. - Did you say something? - Me? Nothing. The blood has stopped. Come on, it doesn't burn. - What's wrong, Fabio? - What? - What's wrong? - Everything's ringing. My head's splitting. I'm almost done so you can... get back to bed and you will feel better. Please, lower your voice. Lower your voice. - Come and lay down in bed. - Okay. What the fuck... Sheriff... Lower that flashlight. I told you not to overdo it. But you didn't listen. Now I'm in charge! You make me laugh. You are the servant of the one who gives you order. That's where you're wrong. Here I command. - I pity you. - Pity? Sometimes you have to be careful like a bull in 3 china shop. You've gone too far this time. I've lived long enough. I made my life. But you... you DISGUSTING poor man... ...are hiding behind someone who is bigger than you! You have just screwed your last wish. Speaking in Rumanian. Sheriff. They found him near the Tiber, under the gasometer. Poor Sheriff, what a bad ending. The divers are there since yesterday. I think they left the head there to misdirect us, right? No, I don't think so. I think they were hasty and clumsy. He was killed several kilometers away and the head was found there, but unintentionally. In my opinion... Claudio has something to do with it. "Er Pugile" (The Boxer) Sheriff was standing in Claudio's way and he was protected by Giorgio... - Il Cassamortaro (The Coffin Maker). - Il Cassamortaro. Should we look for anyone? Maybe a friend? No, he had no one. Well, maybe someone. What is it? Silvia. What did she do? She was in her bedroom, and she was putting on this lipstick! It's normal, she is a child who wants to be a woman. It's not normal if the lipstick is a gift from his father's friend! What are you talking about? What happened? Come on, tell your dad who gave you this beautiful purple lipstick. But I didn't want to, he told me it was a gift! Who? Who? - Son of a bitch! - Fabio! Fabio! Son of a bitch! She is my daughter, fucking pedophile! Son of a bitch, she is my daughter! She is my daughter, fucking pedophile! Claudio! - Fabio is making a mess! - Fabio? What the fuck is he doing here? - He's beating Cencio to death, come! - Cencio? What the fuck is he doing? Holy shit! - No wait are you leaving?! - Leave me, I've things to do. What did he do? I think he tried to make a pass at his daughter. What the fuck happened? - That fucking Canaro messed up. - I would hit you myself, too. What the fuck are you doing? Do you make a pass at a child? What child, Claudio? It was a joke. A joke? I sized you up for a while. I didn't say anything to not put you on the spot. If the others find out about it they will cut your cock and they will make you swallow it. Did you understand, asshole? - I swear, it was just a joke. - Don't swear, go wash your mug. You're so dirty that you suck. Come on! Listen, let me speak. I know him and how to talk to him. Hi, Fabio! Chief, still here? Are you in love with me? - Have you heard about the Sheriff? - No, what happened? A fisherman found him near the Tiber, under the gasometer. Were you friends, right? Yes. Do you know who could have done that? No. Is there any chance... maybe a crash. He was beheaded, we can't find the body. It's an execution. He never harmed anyone. I wouldn't say anyone. We think that your friend has something to do with it. Claudio. If you know something, would you tell us? So you can redeem yourself. Chief. I spent 8 months trying to redeem myself. - And I'm not a rat. - But they killed your friend! Let my friend rest in peace! Look, Fabio. Think about it. You know where to find me, okay? Maybe you need help. Come on. Lo Russo. He was really upset. Gianni, what do you stand for? Claudio. If I tell you what I just saw you wouldn't believe me. Do you know any thieves who got rich? I just wanna worry about my family. It can get you an incredible power, but sometimes it can even kill you. What happened? Now the special guest has arrived, I take her away. Where are you going? - Say good night to dad. - Good night. - What happened? Are you worried? - A little bit. It's uncle Claudio he only has to talk to dad, man stuff, things like that. You have Bea. What do you mean with man stuff? Silvia, the nosey. Don't be a nosey and listen to this. Loud. So? Something you want to say? I don't know what you mean. - Don't act like you don't know. - Shut your mouth! - What do you wanna do, piece of shit? - Leave him alone! He is right. Go and grab a beer, come on. Anna. Your husband... gives me no satisfactions. No, it's just that... he has his problems. He has his problems, poor thing. Maybe I can help you. - So you won't talk to the cops. - Cops? I don't talk to the cops. I saw them leaving your shop this afternoon, rat! I'm not a rat and you have to shut your mouth, fucking pedophile. Fabio, come on! He's just a little nervous, but he will gets over, right Fabio? He is nervous. He is nervous! If you knew how much I'm nervous! How much it chaps my ass that my friend is a fucking grass to the cops! I'm not a grass to the cops! I'm not a grass to the cops! - Don't touch me! - He is joking! So? Do I need to remind you who is in charge here and out of here? Need I? I think so. Come on! Let's have some fun. - Stop it, Claudio! - Let me see! Fabio! Fucking bastard! Take that gun off him! - Stop it! - Piece of shit, put the gun down! It's okay. Let me see what you have. Hey! Did she ever tell you about when we were young? We had some pretty good times behind that wall, my friend! - He's messing with you, don't trust him. - Look at her, Fabio! - Don't listen to him, he's joking! - Come on, come on! He's just having fun! - Let me see, let me see! - Stop it! Get off me, stop it! Now I'll show you how to fuck your wife! Stop you! - Tell me who is fucking your wife, who? - You're hurting me! - Let her go. - Who is fucking your wife? - Claudio is fucking my wife. - I didn't get it! - Claudio is fucking my wife! - Claudio who? Claudio! Claudio Renzi! It felt so great. Awesome! Talk to that fucking cop again and you're a dead man. Get off me! Here you go. You're fine, here. Bye. Hold on. Let me take this off... You never harmed anyone. So, what do you want? Don't you remember us? He doesn't remember us. I remember you! I asked what the fuck do you want? Ranieri is tired of your excuses. - Why the drug dealing is not working? - It's working, it's working. - Now piss off, I have to go. - No no, Ranieri made it clear. Teach this prick a lesson! Screw Ranieri! I will eat him for breakfast, that fucking faggot! Gianni, we analyzed the microchip of the burned dog. We've been able to read the data. Now we know where to catch them. I'm going with the officers to the abandoned warehouse. They organize the fighting there. If we are lucky, we may catch them. Hi, Fabio. I need to talk to you. I got no beef with you. But you have to understand. This time I can't forgive you. I didn't want to fuck your wife. But I had to teach you a lesson in front of the others. You shouldn't have disrespect me! Fabio. We are not friends, we are brothers. I don't know what came over me. I was high. Come on, Fabio. I always protected you. Okay. I get it. See you later. You needed a new life and I gave it to you. If you have this stuff is because of me. Is this the thanks I get for helping you with the shop? Need I remind you who is in charge here and out of here? Tell me who is fucking your wife, who? You're hurting me! - Hey. - Hey. Tell Claudio... I have to talk to him. It's important. He is coming. I'll wait for him at the shop. - And this one? - What? I put it because I don't want they look at me from outside. - So, did you say a calabrian? - Yes, but you don't know him. At this time he has done with dealing drugs and has lots of money. He is full of money. - But why is he coming here? - I've to pay him. So what? - Fifty-fifty? - Sure. I'm in, I'm in. So listen to me. You hide in here. When I give you the signal, you suddenly get out you punch him and you push him down. We steal his money. Then, you punch me too, so I have the alibi. Seem fair, I like it. He can see me here. No, I'll put a tarp on it, don't worry, I'll cover for you! - Are you sure? - Yes. - Shall we try? - Yes, let's try. - Do you think is big enough? - Yes. - Are you sure? It looks small. - No, no. So what do you think? It's okay. Hey! Open this cage, stop joking! It's big enough, we tested it! It's okay, it's big... Come on, open this cage. Open the cage! Open this fucking cage! What the fuck are you looking at? Open this cage, asshole! Open it, piece of shit! Open it, open this fucking cage! I will cut you into pieces! When I get out, I will kill you! Open this cage! Who put the Mandrione's boss into the cage? Er Canaro. I can't hear you. Er Canaro. I can't hear you. - Er Canaro. - I can't hear you! ER CANARO! Good. I'm in charge now. Let me out, please. Please. Let me out of this fucking cage! Let me out. Yeah. I could let you out of here. Yeah. Then I could get you to the hospital. So they can stitch up your fingers. But who tells me you're not taking revenge and you'll keep your mouth shut? No, Fabio. You know me, I don't take revenge. Exactly, it's because I know you. Who was with you that day at the hospital? Who was with you day and night? Everybody left you, but me. Please. Please. Everybody left you, but me. Son of a bitch, I will kill you! I'm going to cut you into pieces! Screw you, piece of shit! IT IS ME WHO WILL KILL YOU. ME. Let me go! What are you doing? I'm going to kill you. I'll kill you. Do you know what is your problem? You talk too much. You talk too much. Open your mouth. Open your mouth. Open this fucking mouth! Here it is! Finally in jail! Drive! Take it easy! Get off me! Let me go! Well done, detective! Are you glad you finally arrested me? - You won a prize! - Finally! I couldn't see you in my office anymore. You are an asshole. Let me go! Get off of me! Detective, we found this. I forgot to tell you something. Anna greets you. It looks so weird like this. You only have bad thoughts. I knew it. Don't worry. I got it. That's better. That's better. I grew up next to you as the grass... that grows and grows. But nobody sees it. Good or bad... everyone tramples it. You wanted me that way. You want... people who don't laugh, who don't cry. You're all that matters. Piece of shit! Everyone has to admire you. Everyone has to look at you. But now it's my turn now. My turn! We got them all, Chief. Good, we have the others. We can't find Claudio. Where are you? I know. I'm going to the Canaro's shop and see if he's there. De Nardis. De Nardis. Are you here? Fabio! Gianni... He was a criminal like everyone else. No. He wasn't. I call the station. Okay. I'll stay here. My dear love... I'm sorry I left. I couldn't take it anymore. I've lived a hangdog life and I made you live in a cage. I hope to catch up with my friends again one day... the only ones I've ever had. Four-legged friends but with a big heart with a whole world inside. You were right, I messed up. But I swear I only wanted the best for us and for Silvia. I hope this money will help you live... with less thoughts on your mind and will allow you to walk away. I've never been good at telling you that I love you. I'm telling you now, like in movies. I love you and I give you a kiss. A real love kiss.
