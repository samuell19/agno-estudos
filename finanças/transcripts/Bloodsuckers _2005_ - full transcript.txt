(eerie music) - [Narrator] They used to call space the final frontier. Now it's more like a trash heap. The second we strapped a nuke drive on hunk of metal, we spread our seed all across the cosmos, and slammed into a new reality. Turns out, there is intelligent life out there. Most of it vampiric. Every variety a soulless intergalactic cockroach madrigal. Forget your mythology. The sunlight, crosses, holy water. That's for kids and comic books. Out here, we're the first on the ground against the blood-sucking breed, V-SAN, Vampire Sanitation. Some say it's the toughest job you'll ever hate. I call it a living, and as long as there's fangheads out there, my job's a lock. - Humans, fear not. Lay down your weapons. Disengage your air defense. We mean you no harm. We, the Voorhees, are a peaceful nation. A vampiric anomaly. Decidedly different in appearance, yet very similar in methodology. Welcome us into your homes so that we may become brothers. For that is what we will do for you. Let us all live in peace. (eerie music) - Clear. - Look at the mess they made of these bastards. Poor thing, rest in peace. (woman screeches) (woman gasping) I hate when that happens. - Look on the bright side, at least they didn't turn 'em. - Disengage your air defense. - Vampires suck. - We mean you no harm. We, the Voorhees, are a peaceful nation. - Damn recruiting ads! Shoot 'em! (gun fires) - [Captain] Rosa? - Mess hall clear, sir. - [Captain] What the hell were you firing at? - False alarm, captain. - Whole planet doesn't need to know we're here. - [Rosa] Yes sir, how's it going with you? - Let you know. You okay? - Yeah. Just bumping on what the textbook says the Voorhee does. And what a victim really looks like. - At least they're not essence eaters, or organ feeders. - Why couldn't the universe just be full of old fashioned vampires? You know, they just want to suck up blood. - Got plenty of those out here too. If it's any consolation, after a while, you do get used to it. - Oh, and that's a good thing? (object clatters) (suspenseful music) (men grunt) (eerie music) (metal creaking) - Isn't that sweet? (suspenseful music) - Oh god, they gutted him. Why? - He's the CO here. Voorhee son a bitch who did this is sending me a message. - You know who did this? - Here we go, it's industry, Rosa? Let's RV back at Hieronymus. Quintana, you five by five? - I'm here. - [Captain] Update. - There are Voorhees in the neighborhood. - [Captain] Any ideas? - I don't think your little trigger finger gave us away. - Someday I'm gonna smoke that bitch. - Somebody needs to get laid. - [Captain] Rosa, you copy? - Yes sir, I did. - All right, let's RV. Everybody watch your backs. - Captain, are we gonna cut this guy down? He's IPC, and officer battlefield protocols-- - Protocol? What good is protocol gonna do him? He's dead. It's a lovely sentiment and all, but out here, it's them that'll get you killed. (intense music) - All indications are that the Voorhee group responsible is in country in the immediate vicinity. THough exact ID is impossible without hard contact, it is known that the Voorhee have been operating in this quadrant. We will inform as to our progress, and as to the nature of the operation once we have made said contact. - You and this Voorhee, name's Phleg. I made his acquaintance at the battle of Shreelock during the last vampire wars. My platoon and his mixed it up pretty good. We ended up being the only survivors. For a while there, 'til they got the upper hand on me. - [Damian] Why didn't he kill you? - I don't know. Probably having too much fun torturing me. You know, what the hell? Gave me time, so I could turn the tables on him. - Why didn't you kill him? - I hesitated. Remember what I told you about sentiment? Same thing applies to hesitation. How far away are they Quintana? - A click or two, I estimate four in the party. Some blood shells heading into the jungle, too. - Took survivors with them. Commanding officer back there was gutted alive. - Phleg. - I didn't know you were a mind reader. I'd swear you read my mind. - Yeah, Phleg, this definitely has his pong to it. - That's funny. Vampires setting another vampire's stakes, you're a riot. - Do you see me laughing? - Hey, there are people out here we should be saving. - You got a lot to learn about vamps. - Voorhees still come in the woods to feed. Rescue's now past tense. This is a cleanup. - What is it about human flesh that makes it so tasty out of doors? - Come closer, and I'll let you know. - Ooga booga-- - Ladies! Let's put it away. Rosa, you're on knockdown. Everyone else, make sure you get your short lances ready. Let's do it. - Couldn't we just shoot 'em? - Homeboy don't want a chippendale. - Not all vampires are created equal. What kills one is useless on another. Only way to kill a Voorhee is to shoot him in the heart. To do that, you gotta pierce the bone casing that surrounds their chest cavity. - Right, the book said there's no point in wingin' 'em, 'cause they heal too fast. - Field tested mythology on Voorhee is to knock 'em, sock 'em, bring 'em to the ground and-- - [All] Spike 'em! - You relayed our situation to corporate? - Done. - Good, let's go play in the woods. - Off to grandma's house we go. (rock music) ♪ White sand ♪ ♪ Hidden fang ♪ - It's a horrible way of life, in the trenches. These days, stalk them before battle takes place, at a safe distance, with mechanized weapons. We're the only ones who get dirty. That's the way it goes when you get paid to be the poor jerks who stick their head around the corner first. - Yeah, well I can't say you didn't warn me. - Neutron bombs, surgical strikes, they're good for some things, but when you really need to know it's do it on the ground. - You're a decorated soldier. You don't need to be doing this. - No, no I don't. - Yeah, so why are you then? I mean, hunting vampires with the V-SAN corps? That's the worst stinkin' job in the entire galaxy. - Has it ever occurred to you that some people just plain like it? (ominous music) (vampires laughing) (man screaming) (vampires laughing) (blood hissing) (vampires munching) (vampires laughing) (speaking foreign language) (gun fires) (intense music) (vampire screams) Rosa and Damian, target two!

(vampire laughs) - Thought you said Voorhees were horrific looking, intimidating. - Show him the infrared scanner. - Smile for the camera. - Eugh. - See, Damian? Beauty's only skin deep, isn't that right, Phleg? - Cut me some slack! Nicky, huh, I'll make it worth your while. You want money? I get it for you, or platinum! I know big stash, belongs to the leatherfaces. (Phleg laughs) - Platinum, huh? How much are we talking? - Kilos, mega kilos! - What are the leatherfaces doin' with it? (vampire laughs) - That's why I love you, Nicky. Only line, bottom line with you, huh? (Phleg grunts) (gun fires) (Phleg groaning) - Enough of the foreplay. Where's the stash? - Chatilla 10. Leatherfaces not guarding it. You take it, buffet style! (Phleg groans) - How do I know you're not lying? - On my sweet mother's life, may she rest in peace. It is true. - Well as I recall, Phleg, you killed your sweet mom. - Screw you! (gun fires) (blood spatters) (pleasant music) (ship engines roaring) - Thought maybe you fell asleep. - And miss your home cooking? - [Oven] Meal at optimum temperature. Caution, filling may be hot. - Here you go. - Sorry. - It's okay. No matter how long you stare at it, it still tastes like crap. They didn't teach you about days like this in the academy, did they? - No, they didn't. - You know, all things considered, you didn't do badly. - Is it always that cold? - No, we just got lucky. - You know what I liked? The look in Phleg's eyes, just before Churchill smoked him. - He's all like, "Oh Nicky, no please, I have family," boom! - Hardcore juicy. - [Oven] Optimum temperature-- - Do we have to talk about it? - When did you get so sensitive? - You are not gonna drink that here. - As much fun as your company is, I'd rather enjoy my plasma in peace. - She's spooky. (country music) ♪ Well I'm walking ♪ ♪ In the desert ♪ - Thanks, just down on the counter. ♪ And I'm looking ♪ - Captain? I appreciate everything you've done, bringing me on board, giving me a shot, but truth is, I don't think I'm cut out for this. - First op is always hard, I told you it would be. - I don't see it getting any easier. - Meaning? - I'll have to find another way. I stink at hunting vampires. - Of course you do, it was your first time. Not to mention that attitude you got slung over your shoulder. - All the more reason for me to move on. - And do what? Become a desk jockey, command some tanker crew? You know damn well that's not gonna get you anywhere, and besides, those companies wouldn't touch you anyway. - Look, what happened on the Meconium was not my fault. - Wasn't there, Damian, I don't know. But you had your day in court, and you're now officially damaged goods. That's not how I feel, 'cause I hired you, didn't I? But still, you need to change people's minds about you. And the fastest way there, is by getting your hands dirtied, and your hide toughened. If you show good, solid command capabilities in an environment like this, they're gonna rethink busting you. Although why you'd wanna go back there is beyond me. - Because I like it. Look, if I have to, I'll put in for a transfer. - Transfer? A transfer requires your commanding officer's signature, and the way I see it, your pain is my gain. I got me a top rate officer, highly skilled, smart, way too loyal for his own good, and I got you cheap. And I'm betting with a little time, and experience, you're gonna be a top shelf asset to both me, and my crew. So you go ahead, you plan your little escape, but until I tell you otherwise, your butt is mine. - [Computer] Roman Kachinsky is seeking access. - Your instincts brought you here, and those instincts were good. Access granted. - Captain? - Yep. - We've picked up a distress call. (guns firing) - My name's Fiona Kennedy. I'm a scientist here at the cobalt processing facility on Basra 14. We are under attack by vampires. I don't know how many of us are left. I've locked myself in the transmission room. Please, please if anyone gets this, please hurry. My name's Fiona Kennedy-- - If we slingshot this orbit, we can be there in a couple hours. - Shouldn't we contact the company first? We don't even know what kind of vampire force is attacking. It could be rogues, or regiment. I mean, the five of us can only generate so much firepower. - Let me tell you a little something about the company, Damian. We get paid, the company gets paid. Company gets paid, we go to battle. - You betcha. - What do you think their answer's gonna be? - Understood, but if I'm gonna be an asset to you and this crew, then my knowledge of battlefield-- - That will all come in very handy once you understand the rules. If we delay, there won't be anybody left to save. Part of our job is to walk into a situation, then figure out a response. But I promise you, if we find ourself a little something fierce, I'll get us the hell out of there, okay? Go tell the others. - Yes, sir. (blues music) - Starboard thrusters three percent, and release. Pull retro five percent for eight seconds. - You got the touch, kid. Good job. (blues music) Until we know what we're dealing with, let's keep our options open, boys and girls. Let's hit the ground, automatics and close combat weapons ready. Safety's off, gear up, get hot! Is everyone with me? - Five by five! - [All] Five by five! - Access bay door open. ♪ Cigarettes ♪ ♪ They're up all night ♪ ♪ Freaks are in my bed ♪ - Clear! - Clear! - Clear! (metal clanks) (intense music) (Quintana hissing) - Please don't hurt me! And then I just hid out in here. I locked the door, and prayed like hell they didn't find me. - Is anyone else alive? - There was one SOS from the mine, and then nothing. - [Nick] See anything? - Oh yeah. They're leatherfaces. (speaking foreign language) - What's the book on them? - Well? - The good news? They're stupid and relatively primitive, and a lot easier to whack than Voorhee. They don't have the internal bone casing, or the ability to heal. They're bleeders. You shoot 'em, they die. - So what's the bad news? - They travel in packs. Big packs. (ominous music) (guns cocking) - I don't see why I couldn't just stay in the comm center. - Believe me, this is where you wanna be. - Down here? - With us. They're close. - Any idea where this tunnel goes? - Hub map indicates a structure, 100 meters. - That's right, a weighstation. Had equipment, food supplies, a communications port too. - Potential origin of the SOS. - All right, let's move. Quintana? Watch our backs. - Consider them watched. - That's comforting. (suspenseful music) - Hey, what's goin' on? I thought you said that-- (vampires snarling) (intense music) Light it up! (vampires snarling) - Uh-oh. - Final positions! (guns firing) - What the hell was that? - Explosive headed spear! - I thought you said they were primitive! - Relatively primitive. - What are we gonna do? - Like my old football coach used to say, the best defense is a kickass offense. Go! (guns firing) (intense music) (vampire snarling) (gun fires) Go, go, go, go, into the elevator, fall back! Come on, ah! (guns firing) (vampire snarling) (Nick laughs) (guns firing) (vampires growling) (guns firing) (vampires yelling) High tech piece of crap. (vampires yelling) Holy mother of god. There must be 100 of 'em. (Nick screams) - Captain! (vampires snarling) (gun fires) - Blow the security system! - Captain, if we do that-- - Just do it, it's an order! It'll buy us some time. (Nick groans) (intense music) (gun firing) (explosion booms) - [Announcer] Security breach, sector four. Initiating lockdown. Security breach, sector four. Initiating lockdown. - What the hell is going on? Where the hell is the captain? Captain Churchill, what is your 20? (radio crackling) - Two team, fight and recon. Backup team, hold the exit. - We'll be the fire time. - You stay here. You, try not to bite anyone. (intense music) - Captain, let's see, let's go! (gun fires) (gun firing) (explosions booming) Come on! (gun firing) Captain, what are you doing? Captain, come on! (emotional music) (gun firing) Come on! (vampires screaming) Captain, hold on! - Help me! - Move out the way! (Nick screaming) Captain! - Help me! Help me! (vampires snarling) - Captain! - Fall back. - Move! - Fall back! Fall back right now, he's gone, there's nothing we can do! - Move it! - Fall back, damn it! Fall back! - We gotta help him! - We can't help him, all we can do is die. (guns firing) (vampires snarling) (emotional music) Therefore, it is recommended that the mining colony at Basra 14 be handed over to Star Command for alternative strategy. At present, no other assignments have been logged into the Hieronymus master control. So we remain in this quadrant until contacted by company HQ. This is Damian Underwood, captain pro tem of the Hieronymus. (emotional music) I notified corporate about what happened. Should hear back shortly. In the meantime, I think it's important to talk about-- - What, the fact that you just left him there? - It's basic, vampire hunters do not leave another vampire hunter behind. - Any attempt to save Captain Churchill would have compromised the rest of the team. - We were already compromised when you trashed the security system. - Blowing the security system was Captain Churchill's idea. - Is that something you learned at the academy? When all else fails, blame the dead guy? - No wonder they court-martialed you. Everybody you ever work with ends up getting killed. I say we ditch this jerk before the same thing happens to us. - Like it or not, I am now the captain of this ship. - You are the guy temporarily in charge, not the captain. - Why don't you give him a chance? - Why don't you shut up, bloodsucker? - Say that one more time, and I'll-- - What, suck my blood? - You two have been angling for me since we started this sortie. I say, come and get it. - And I say, kiss my ass, but you'd probably bite it instead. - You fang heads are all alike! Admit it, you set us up! - All right, everyone sit down, right now. I said plant it! You wanna point fingers? You point 'em where they deserve. What happened to Captain Churchill was unfortunate, but everything about that operation was reckless. - Don't you even try to pin this on the captain. - If we had followed any one of the protocols of engagement, none of this damn conversation-- - Ah, this guy doesn't know anything! There's no way you can be in charge! - Right, so you take your protocols and shove 'em. - What the hell did you expect us to do? Risk everything, and everyone just to bring a body back? - Yeah, those were leatherfaces. They wear their kills as trophies! - Captain Churchill didn't deserve to become a hood ornament. We should've done whatever it took. Then again, you didn't wanna be there in the first place, so running came easy. - I've had just about enough of both of you. - We had enough of you the first day you came aboard. You wanna be the captain, fine, just be it somewhere else. ♪ Lost in space ♪ ♪ The planets are spinnin' ♪ ♪ Torn apart ♪ ♪ Between what's old and what's new ♪ ♪ Adrift in a memory ♪ ♪ Where ♪ - [Computer] Captain, Fiona Kennedy is seeking access. - Access granted. ♪ Reality's calling me ♪ ♪ On my way ♪ - How're you feeling? - Okay, I guess. I just want you to know how terrible I feel about what happened, and how grateful I am. - Just doin' my job. - Your captain seemed like he was a very good man. - There's a transit station a couple days from here. From there, you can probably hitch a ride wherever you wanna go. - Thanks, I appreciate it. - What was it you said you did on Basra? - Soils analysis. - Right. So when the vampires first arrived, you weren't actually in the control center. - I was in the lab module, why? - Something I noticed when I was in the comm center. The electronic defense system was turned off. I'm trying to establish when exactly that happened. - Like I said, I wasn't there. We heard something was going on, and we rushed back. - We? - Some of the other scientists and me. Paul Gevain, Nate McKinnon. I can't believe they're dead. They were such good people. - I'm sorry. (somber music) Damian Underwood. Just wanted to see if you were okay. What I mean is-- - You wanted to thank me for standing up for you. I read minds. Normally, I'd ask, but I'm sorry. - No, that's okay. Just, something I have to keep in mind about you. - That I read minds, you mean? - Right. - Do you mind if I? - No, no, go right ahead. After what happened, it's amazing you still have an appetite. - If I don't feed, the hunger gets harder to control. - I just wanted to let you know that from here on, I'm not gonna tolerate them baiting you like that. If this were a Star Command ship-- - You'd court-martial them, except it's not Star Command, so you can't. - Right. - [Dispatcher] This is transit station control. Hieronymus, you are clear to land in bay 121. - Very disappointing, baby. Not enough friction. The hard eight is not very hard! Come along, my friend. - So we're just gonna check, but I'm sure you can find someone you can hitch a ride with. In the meantime, I mean food's-- - Thanks for your help. I hope you don't mind me asking, but how does a guy like you end up doing something like this? - A question arose between my commanding officer and me as to who was telling the truth. - What was the question about? - Who was responsible for killing the rest of the crew. Travel safely. Where are the others? - Up front. (people shouting) - We've all had our fill, I think we should head back to the ship. - We won't be joining you. Roman, know where merc support is? - What exactly does that mean? - It means we won't be joining you. Me and Roman put in for transfers, so until the company tells us where we need to be, we're gonna do a little sightseeing. - Halcyon, my buddy Hollander runs a bar there. It's called Pop Rocks. - You can't do this, we're a crew. - Yeah, right. What time's that supply wagon outta here, Roman? - It's outta here in about 10 minutes, so we gotta bust some hump. - [Rosa] Later. - Just my opinion, Captain, good riddance. - They're not goin' anywhere. (scanner beeping) - [Device] Welcome aboard, Helen Rapaport. (scanner beeping) Your personal information file is currently unavailable. Please try back another time. - What the hell does that mean? - Here, let me have a look at that. (scanner beeping) - [Device] Your personal information file is currently unavailable, please try back another time. - Five minutes that way and it'll leave without us. - I dunno what else to do. I'm not-- - Is there a problem here? - Yeah, your stupid scanner isn't working. - Let me see your identification cards, please. (device beeps) (cards snap) System says you no longer work for the V-SAN Corporation, which means you ain't nobody, and bein' nobody, you ain't goin' nowhere. - It must suck bein' nobody. - What is your problem? - Me? I don't have a problem, whereas you two... It's all right, Officer Brackish. I can vouch for 'em, provided they behave themselves. - It's your party. - [Damian] You didn't even have the decency to ask me for a transfer. - What would've been the point? You'd have said no. - You're right, I would have, because in spite of all the fun we're not having, being captain, I have responsibility. - Spare us the regimental bull. - And one of those responsibilities is you, so get used to it. You want me to be an A-hole? That was how to be a Star Fleet captain 101 at the academy, and I finished top of my class. - Yeah, we believe you, especially the A-hole part. Why are you so determined to hold onto us? You afraid it'll get out that you're such a loser you couldn't even captain a V-SAN crate? - Whatever you know about me, is whatever you think you know about my past, and maybe that my skills as a vampire hunter are somewhat underdeveloped. - Oh, you forgot the part about killing a guy we all liked. - Let's just put a pin in that one. For the moment, let's just say that everything else is true. I need you, you need me, makes this simple. You two behave yourselves, and I promise my e-signature will appear next to your name on a transfer request. - How long do we have to behave ourselves? - Until I sign. - That could take forever. For all we know, you could just be jerking us around. - Okay then, one mission. - Really? One. That's all? - However, I reserve the right to add time, and missions if I'm not completely satisfied. That's the deal, take it or leave it. - Yeah, I can do that. - Good. Then as of now, I expect normal crew protocol to be followed, to the letter. (Rosa scoffs) Oh come on, spare me the attitude, all right? Same goes for you, because every time I see it, there's another day I withhold my signature. Ditto every time I see you stickin' it to Quintana. If so much as an unkind thought passes between you, that's another day. So, are we a crew? - Yes, sir. - You're the captain. - What I said about sticking it to each other, it cuts both ways. - Understood, sir. - Good. Quintana, notify the security office back at the transit station we will not be returning, all is well. - Yes, sir. - Now, while we're waiting for the company to tell us what our next assignment is, I'd like a complete assessment of our system's status. Areas of concern, ship maintenance and weapons. As far as I'm aware, the logs are way behind on each. - Yes, sir. - With all due respect, sir, you cannot captain a V-SAN ship like a Command vessel. There's a reason people like us chose to be here instead of there. Just trying to be helpful, sir. - Captain, you're needed on the bridge immediately. (tense music) When I tried to send your message to the transit station, this is what I got back. (people screaming) - This is an urgent SOS from transit station Delta Hotel Foxtrot, we're under attack! Send help, send help now! (man screaming) - Oh hell. (somber music) (camera clicking) (man groans) (electricity crackles) Someone disarmed the electronic defense system. - Isn't that what happened in the mining colony at Basra? - We know who did this yet, Quintana? - Could be one of several vampire species. The energy signatures they're leaving behind are unfamiliar. - Thought you knew every vampire species there was. - Every known vampire species. It's hard to know about something no one's ever encountered. - Can you tell anything? - This vampiric life form, they're venomous. The venom contains a toxin that's incredibly lethal. - Is it the toxin that smells so bad? - No, the toxin's odorless. It's the flesh that stinks. The venom causes instantaneous necrotization of the skin and muscle fibers. These creatures, they don't feed on live beings. They like 'em dead, but still warm. - Charming. Let's go find 'em.

(vampire snarling) (guns firing) (Rosa yelling) (vampire groaning) - That was a rush! - You sense any other vampiric presence here? - It's really bizarre, yes I do sense vampiric presence, and yet? (vampire gurgling) - [Damian] Everybody stay back. (vampire gurgling) - Holy. (vampire squealing) Quintana! (gun firing) (vampire shrieking) - Come on, get it off my leg! Get it off me, get it off my leg! (electricity crackling) (vampire squealing) (Roman screams) Go! - Use your tasers! (electricity buzzing) (vampires squealing) (Rosa grunts) - What the hell are these things? - Vermisnous variety. That's what threw me. That creature we killed, he wasn't the vampire, he was the host. The nosferati travel in him, then emerge when it's time to feed. - Or when the host can't host 'em anymore. (host gurgling) - Let, let this one live. - What? - I wanna know more about it. - It's a vampire, what more do you need to know? - Right, everyone set your weapons to stun. (flesh burbling) (vampire squeaking) (speaking foreign language) - It's surprising, the dialect it speaks. I know it. - What a surprise. What, it's surprising, don't ya think? - Transit station. (speaking foreign language) Transit station. (speaking foreign language) (electricity buzzes) (vampire yelps) (speaking foreign language) I asked him how did his host creature get here, to the transit station? All he'll say is betrayal. - Betrayal? (speaking foreign language) - He says if we didn't need you for food, we'd wipe you out. (vampire chuckles) To most of the universe, you're arrogant, emotional scum. The only thing better than feeding on you is watching the look in your eyes when you die. (intense music) (people screaming) (dishes clattering) (vampires laughing) (Roman grunts) (gun whirs) - Here's for my family, you slithering piece of crap. (vampire screams) (gun fires) (electricity crackles) - It's over, Roman, you can't kill it twice! - It can't be dead enough, as far as I'm concerned. - What were you thinking? He was talking to us! - He was mouthing off. We didn't need to hear any more of that crap! - He was right about one thing, about being arrogant. - Oh, you agree with 'em. Maybe you wanted to keep 'em alive so the two of you could turn on us? - Emotional scum, is that you talking to the worm? - Don't you think it's emotional, killing something because it hurt your feelings? - Oh I'm gonna do a lot more than hurt your feelings, honey. - All right, that's enough, you stop! - Come on, take your shot. (Damian grunts) (glass tinkles) (both grunting) (Roman yells) (Quintana hisses) - Get her, Roman! - The creme de la creme of creation. Every time I think about how we are what we are I wanna scream. Does the rest of the world really deserve us? - We should beam this back to earth so they can see both the horror and the stupidity of our pioneers. - That's human arrogance for you. 300 years ago, the white man moved across the North American continent. Manifest destiny, they called it. A moral imperative to rape the land, and kill its Native peoples because they were deemed to be savages. Has anything changed? Now we are told to hate the vampire, when really, the enemy is us. We're the savages. - Earth still has a conscience, and it beats right here. - We did well today. - We struck another blow against unbridled Earth imperialism. - We nurtured freedom toward human hegemony. - Of course, another way of looking at it is you served up a couple of dozen happy meals to a bunch of vampires. - Oh, I know you'd like us to think you're really that cynical, Muco. But deep down, I know you believe in what we're doing. That it's in everyone's interest that we contain human expansion in the universe. - I definitely believe, but I'll believe a lot more when I get my hands on the human scum who killed my brother. - Why do you care so much? You didn't even like Phleg. - Like him, I hated him. He was stupid, arrogant, he stank. But the point is, he was killed by a human being and I'm obligated to avenge him. - But you did that, you took care of that captain, the man responsible. (Muco grunts) (Muco chuckles) - I'm surrounded by idiots. I want them all. This one, who's taken command of this ship, are you sure he'll make his way to us? - Damian Underwood, he's the exception here. He'll pick up the scent, there's no doubt about it. - Captain? Captain, can I have a word? - You got 30 seconds. - The rest of the crew and me, we wanna apologize. We let our emotions get the better of us, and we're sorry. - Not half as sorry if I never sign your transfer request and you have to spend the rest of your pathetic lives here with me, right? Apology not accepted. (electricity crackles) - That never even came up. Okay, maybe at first, but it was just a big misunderstanding. We were angry at Quintana, she was angry with us. - Oh, and now you're not angry? Gosh, let's throw a party. - I know we've all been hard on you, especially me. I just want to say, Captain Churchill chose you to be his first officer. So the fact that he chose you, must mean that-- - All the same, his death is still my fault, right? - Look, you gotta understand, calling Captain Churchill reckless, that hurt. We would've walked through hell for that guy. His dying hit us hard. (emotional music) - If it's any consolation, I think Captain Churchill knew exactly what he was doing. He was risking himself to save the rest of us. And though perhaps reckless is a poor choice of words, I'm starting to see that a little recklessness is a good thing out here. I know I can never be him in your eyes, or the others, but if you just give me a little time, I promise that I'll be the best captain to you that I can. - We gotta stick together, whether we like it or not, whether we like each other or not. - Rosa. I want you to know that I take comfort having you on this fire team. You're not just a good soldier, you're a great one. I trust you with my life and heartbeat. (emotional music) (ship roaring) So the worm specifically used the word betrayal to describe how he got there, and the only other body we didn't find amongst the others? - Fiona's. - I mean, does it mean anything? Is it just coincidence that every place she goes ends up being vampire chow? I mean, did she know that the creature we killed was the vampire's host? For the moment, let's say yes. Let's say she did, she's the Trojan horse. Turning off the electronic defense system, for whatever reason, okay? She does her dirty work, then she finds a way to get out, and get to her next victim. If that's the case, the last ship to leave the transit station before ours arrived was hers. Now all departing craft, as part of their computer protocol, leave behind a set of coordinates. - Telling us where they're going, I should've thought of that. - Hieronymus, can you show me where those coordinates are leading to? - [Computer] I'm currently computing the Cosmosis 1's projected flight path. - Cosmosis, isn't that one of those groups? - Who think humans deserve whatever they get, so long as they're being got by a vampire? - So, she's a whacko is what she is. - [Computer] The Cosmosis 1's projected flight path will put them here. - Way the hell over there. - And they've got quite a headstart on us. - Let's break it down. The company just sent us a new assignment. It's a search and destroy mission in the Kenobia System. Anyone familiar with that? - Yeah, I'm familiar with that. That's out there. - So, either we go where the company wants us to go, or we throw the protocol aside for a little while and take a little detour, follow this trajectory to Fiona, knowing that if the company finds out what we're up to, which I'm sure they will, they'll probably fire every one of us. - We owe it to Captain Churchill to run this bitch into the ground. - You can count me in. - Me too. - Good. Then we all agree, we do this for the captain. There'll be no finger pointing later on, we're all in this together. In that case, even though we're in hyperdrive, it's still gonna take a while, so I suggest we all catch up on our rest. - Goodnight. - You know, I'm startin' to like this guy. - Yeah, he's got potential. - Hieronymus, set our course for those same coordinates. And ease into hyperdrive. - [Computer] Destination coordinates sent. The ship will achieve hyperdrive in eight minutes.

(Damian chuckles) ♪ And you know how I feel ♪ - What exactly do you wanna know? - I guess I'm just wondering what it would be like to be you. Your parents were vampirized, right? - They were scientists. Most everyone in the colony was either drained or executed. The vampires who captured my parents recognized that they could be useful, so they turned them. Luckily for them and me, they escaped. - So, when your parents got together, that was before anyone knew about the genetic consequences of two vampirized humans mating? - That their genetics were altered by the vampirization process was of profound interest. That the merged genetics in me created an altogether new kind of being. It wasn't much of a childhood, more like a science experiment. - Doubt I could've endured that. - You'd be surprised how much you could endure when you've had no choice. May I? - Oh, yeah, yeah. - I hope you don't mind me saying this, Captain, but I find you very surprising. Telling us that the company issued an assignment. They didn't, did they? - Well, they did send a communication telling us to sit tight in ready mode. - Well, we came together on this. That was a good idea. - I wanted to see how far we'd go in the name of loyalty. - Is that what you did before, put yourself at risk in the name of loyalty? - Something like that. I used to think that there was nothing more important than loyalty. - But you don't think so anymore. - The Merconium, the ship I was on, was sent to establish a colony in the Sigma System, and there were several support ships, a troop carrier. When we went into hyperdrive, everything was normal. When we came out, the troop carrier turned on us. I don't know, their communication software was telling it that we were now hostile. So I told Captain Perkins, I said with enough time, I could override their communications, and we can reopen talks. - You testified at your court-martial that you issued an order to fire on the troop carrier, that he was incapacitated. - That mission was Captain Perkins' last. He was ill. If he had been court-martialed instead of me-- - He would've become a non-person, no money, no pension, no healthcare benefits. You sacrificed everything for him. - We had this agreement that he would stand up for me. And between his testimonies and his connections, the worst thing that would happen to me was a slight delay in my advancement. - Except he buried you instead. - He wrote a letter apologizing, except he didn't even sign it, for fear that I'd throw it back at him later. Even the apology was a stab in the back. You know, the thing is, I loved that guy. I really did. - Captain Churchill told us that with time, we would come to appreciate you. He wasn't wrong. There is something that I want to do for you. - I'm not sure I know what you mean. - Everyone else is sleeping. I've had some rest myself. The only one who hasn't had a break is you. - I've kicked back some. - It would be my pleasure to relax you. - Quintana, is this? I mean, if I understand you when you say relax me, are you, I mean, not that it isn't... What exactly are you talking about? - Sex. - Okay. Not that I'm unappreciative, but sex would be inappropriate. Not to mention, fatal. I mean, unless I'm forgetting my vampire lore, or maybe it's just urban myth, but when a human and a vampire get together, and the sexual bloodlust hits the vampire woman, doesn't she go all black widow on the guy? - Absolutely. - Is that what you're proposing? - I'm proposing vampiric sex. It's tantric. There's no touching. It's all up here. - I won't say I'm not curious. Still, I'm the captain. Oh, Quintana. Please don't. Do this.

Shall I declare battle stations? (intense music) - Oh hell, they're predators. - They're battle cruisers, vampiric, except for that one, the Cosmosis. - Maybe this wouldn't be happening if the captain were getting some rest instead of just getting some. - All right, everybody hold on, we're going for a ride.

Bring us about. - [Computer] Acknowledged. - We're turning? We just ran away from these guys. - The last thing they'd be expecting is for us to turn. They're expecting us to run, and keep running. Aft retro to six. (ship roaring) Any sign of them? - Do you see the vapor trail over there? - Hieronymus, can we have an immediate radiation level of our environment? - [Computer] Radiation is 632 Roentgens. That'd be 220 times normal. - What's up with that? - Well, it means one of 'em got damaged keepin' up with us, and they're leaking. - Hieronymus, can we ascertain where the vapor is going? - [Computer] Acknowledged. (radar beeping) - Follow that tail to the line and zoom in on the source. - [Computer] Magnification initiated. - What do you think, should we follow? (somber music) Just checking. Stay close. We're in their blind spot, they won't notice us. (Rosa panting) - You and me need to talk. I want to know what you think you saw. I wasn't having sex with Quintana. - Give me a break. Oh Quintana, that is amazing, just like that, right there. - Okay, you know what, you got me. All right, I was having sex, and it was stunning. - Spare me the details. - Except I wasn't having sex with Quintana. I was having sex, in my mind, with my wife. - Your wife, who died? - Yeah. And if me taking a moment to relive my past is unacceptable to you, well that's too damn bad. But if you're the kind of person with the sense I think you have, then you'll go to Quintana yourself and beg, because you need it more than anyone. (device beeping) Quintana, do you know what planet this is? - Since Earth finished mining Diagalov 8, it's been abandoned. It's nothing but a sand pit now. - Perfect place for an ops base, if you ask me. - Yeah, I mean it's not like Cosmosis is welcome back on Earth. Check in before we RV! - Have fun storming the castle! (intense music) - How far is the mining colony from here? - Quite a ways. - They landed here because-- - Captain! (binoculars beeping) - Lock and load, people! Prepare for strafing maneuvers! (drone beeping) Roman, see that drone headed for you? - Damn right I do! (drone whirring) (gun fires) I gotta get a lock on it! (gun fires) Come on baby, come on baby.

(vampires screeching) Not good. - We can't give up. We can't. (vampires screeching) - We're not giving up. - Guys, come here. I think I found something. Give me a hand!

(guns cocking) (vampires snarling) Ready? Aim! - Excuse me, Captain Underwood, are you there? (lights buzzing) Did you hear me, Captain Underwood? - Kinda in the middle of something right now. - I promise, no one will hurt you, or your crew if you come with me. Captain Underwood. - Any thoughts? - What other options do we have? - What would Captain Churchill do? - He'd hear what she had to say. - And then he'd kill her. - Sounds like a plan. - Oh, a traitor. Of course you'd see it that way, Captain Underwood. Can I call you Damian? - You can call me Captain Underwood. - Well, if you really understood the universe, you wouldn't see it that way. - How many human beings have you sentenced to death so far? - I feel badly about the people that died, but they had no business being out there in the first place. - Oh I'm sorry, I missed the day they decided to make you judge and jury. - I have spent most of my professional life studying vampires so that we humans would know how to kill them. And the more I learned about them, the clearer it became that they have as much right to be here as we do. - Right, vampires good, humans bad. - Do you even know what humans have done to this planet? In the process of strip mining its resources, we have totally wrecked its ecosystem. All of its indigenous life forms are either mutated, or infected, or dead. It's the same all over the cosmos. Humans have turned tropical planets into trash cans, deserts into dumping grounds. Vampires are downright friendly by comparison. - Where exactly are we going? - Oh, you should have been dead a while ago, but you're not. That should tell you something. - What if we hadn't found the air shaft up on the surface, you'd have come and got us? - Yes, we would've. Fortunately, you did find it. - So you and your friends, you brought us here for what? - A second chance. Don't look at me, wasn't my idea. (eerie music) - So whose idea was this? (rock music) - Actually Damian, it was mine. - You really think he'll go along? - They don't get any more loyal. - But where are his loyalties now? - What's your point? - I don't know, I just have a bad feeling about this. - I was dead, all right. But not so dead that they couldn't infuse their essence into me, merge their genome and mine, and let me tell you, dying was nothing by comparison. But, once you're on the other side, the benefits make it all worthwhile. - What kind of benefits are we talkin' about? A car allowance, a per diem? - How about immortality, or power, or community? Or for once, actually ending up on the winning team, ah? - I think an argument could be said that that isn't true. - Muco's right, Damian. Human life is vastly outnumbered. There are vampiric life forms that you can't even imagine. Vampires should be the dominant force in the cosmos, but they're not, because they just need to learn to organize themselves a little bit better. The Voorhees wanna learn from us. They realize that there are certain human traits that are worth preserving. That's where you and I come in. - Human ingenuity, for instance. Cultural assertiveness. These are traits that frustrate us, partially because they allow you to flourish, and partially because, as a species, we don't have them. Now there are brothers of mine who would rather just wipe you out, but I say no. Let us learn from you first. Then wipe you out. - Well, I can't say you don't make it sound inviting. So my trip here, what was that, my audition? - Yes, and you did surprisingly well. - Well, I hope you don't expect me to be flattered by that, because I'm not. And as far as me teaching you things goes, well you can kiss my assertiveness. - Oh, Earth man. This is a gift I offer you. (Muco grunts) Whether you accept it or not means nothing to me. (Damian grunts) - Damian, there's another way you can look at it. Allow yourself to be vampirized, and save the others. Join us, and the crew goes free. Refuse, and condemn them to what I'm sure will be a slow and painful death. - They're your crew, too. - Were my crew. Now they're my enemy. - Then so am I. - You should take some time and think about this. - I don't need to! If you're gonna kill us anyway, you might as well just do it! - I'm sorry you feel that way. - Take them both outside. It's time we had a little entertainment. - What's going on? - This is an open certainty. (vampires shouting) I've heard it told that these human beings are capable of great loyalty, so Captain Churchill, I think it's time we tested where your loyalties lie. I want you to kill the prisoner. When you're done, go down and kill the rest of his crew. - Muco, you said if we brought you Captain Underwood, you'd let the rest of his crew go. - I said that, huh? Well, I lied. - And what if I defeat Captain Churchill? What if I kill him, then will you let my crew go free? - Oh that would be quite interesting. - This was about him, not the others. I insist you let them go. - Oh you do, do you? - Yes, I do. It sickens me, what you're doing here. It's barbaric, and unnecessary. - Fiona, don't do this. - You want to learn from us? Try learning compassion. You want to instill loyalty in your comrades? Then show them that your leadership deserves it. The Voorhee are capable of greatness. You are capable of greatness, but not if you can't rid yourself of this inherent tendency towards cruelty. Please, Muco, I beg you. Show everyone here what you are truly capable of. - You want to see what I'm capable of? (gun fires) (Fiona shrieks) (Fiona groans) That's what I'm capable of. (vampires screaming) (speaking foreign language) - Now if everybody's finished talking, let's see some blood. (intense music) - We need to go down to the mine shaft, slowly, without drawing any attention. (Nick hisses) (vampires laughing) - You're making this harder than it has to be, Damian. Do yourself a favor, and die! (vampires yelling) (vampires laughing) Come on, Damian, let's play. (vampires snarling) (Damian grunting) (Nick snarls) (vampires shouting) (Nick growling) - Relax, their captain has secured their release. You don't believe me, go ask Muco. (vampires snarling) - What the hell is going on here? - You are to surrender your weapons to us. - Why don't you come get 'em? (vampires snarling) - If that's what the captain wants. (vampires chuckling) - Don't scratch it. (clock ticking) - Give it to him! (vampires laughing) (tense music) - Now! (guns firing) (intense music) Let's go! (vampires growling) - Surf's up! (glass tinkles) (vampires laughing) Rip his throat out! (vampires shouting) (gun fires) (gun fires) Go. (guns firing) - [Rosa] Roman, that's Captain Churchill! - Captain Churchill is dead. (Nick groans) - Damian, please. How can you do this, please. You're like a son to me. - What was it something you told me once about hesitation and sentiment? I love you, Nick, now die! (Nick screaming) (somber music) (intense music) (gun fires) (gun fires) (vampire screaming) - Where the hell is Muco? - He was here, wasn't it? - Indeed he was. Now he's here. With this human's life in the balance. Squeal, ah. Yeah, I'm going out that door and getting on my ship. Anyone tries to stop me, and this ugly friend of yours becomes hamburger. - Ugly? You think I'm ugly? I want somebody to shoot this idiot right now! - You know, funny thing is, you're going to die anyway. (Muco laughs) (Muco groans) (gentle flute music) (gun hisses) - Got an offer for you, Muco. Drop dead. (emotional music) - [Man] Hey you guys? Wait up! - Thanks. Any more word from corporate? No questions, like what the hell were you guys doing way over there, and why weren't you on the assignment you were supposed to be on? What? - I told them. About the assignment. - That there wasn't one. What the hell do you take us for, a bunch of morons? - She also told us what happened before, on the Meconia. - You think you're the only one capable of loyalty? - No, of course not. - Good, then do us a favor. Have a little faith. - Might as well, 'cause let me tell ya, you're not getting rid of us that easy. - Did corporate say anything else? - No. Just come on home, and pick up your new ship. - Yeah, 'cause the other one got wrecked. (Damian laughs) - Well, what the hell? Looks like we're gonna be stuck together for a while, huh? Anyone wanna join me in the mess? - You're buying. - Like I had a choice. - So Quintana, this sex thing you do?
