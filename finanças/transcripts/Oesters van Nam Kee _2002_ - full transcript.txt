What's good shouldn't last too long, Diablo. Before you know, you'll be believing it. Oysters at Nam Kee Morning, may I see your ticket? But what is your destination, sir? Where do you want to go? Five months earlier Tom... Hey, Berry! Shit! What an old wreck! Fuck, where did you get it? - I stole it round the corner. The silly cow left the keys in. - Great! Shades, in November! This crap cost 150 euro! Gucci? - Yeah, Sunglass Hut. No way, man! It's a toy, man. From Toys'r Us! - Keep it in your pocket. I haven't any bullets! Let's go. Come on, guys. Nothing like a hot rub. That's right... We want all your money. We want your money, fast! I'm busy with this customer. Just sit down. I won't be long. Hey man! Stop it! Fuck! Cops! Where? I can't see anyone. - Behind! I can't see a thing! - Hey, stop it! It's stolen, isn't it? - I wanted to sell it. Put your foot down! You're fucking me up!! Look, just look... The scarf... She takes off her scarf, see? I'm going for a leak. Hey, Merel. You okay? Bastard! He's at it with another woman again! I'm finished with him. - Again? I'm leaving. I got on well with Berry. We did lots of things together. He was okay, Berry was okay. Yes, Berry was a good friend. Not always... Berry was always... ...Berry. But he was never there. He was often with a girlfriend. There was some woman he couldn't handle. You should never let that happen. Stupid! Berry was a talker. He often said dumb things. What he's done now isn't clever. Berry. Berry! Get up. You have to come with me. Rein? Rein. I'm not going outside! - Rein? Rein? What are you doing here? You were going round the world! I came back. Because? - Something went wrong, okay? Rein! The people in the country: we can't... ...disappoint them. Berry. - Yes, coming. What a rotten trick! Assholes! Rotten life... It looks awful! I look awful too. The people who did that... ...should get wrecked too. Hello? It's me. Berry? Where are you? Rein? I had to think about... ...the way Dad sang Radar Love. You're at our French house, right? - Don't ask, Rein. Christ, Berry! You're in deep shit. 'I come there. You're stuck in your room. You never get outside, dummy. Berry, listen... Never mind. You wanna buy horns? 5 euros! 5... only 5! How much do they cost? - Five... How does it work? A battery... On a battery... - Okay. Well, ciao Diablo... Nothing better to do? - No. - Hey, without knowing you, I dreamt of you last night. Yeah? - Yeah. But I'm no dangerous maniac. - All maniacs say that. What? - That they're not dangerous maniacs. Says who? - Me. Here you are. - Thanks. Steam for 2 minutes. Black bean sauce and a finely chopped spring onion... A drop of hot groundnut oil and that's that! Well? - Nice. Nice? There's nothing tastier. I eat them every day. Take my picture. No... Come on, take my picture. Bastard! 26 November, 6.10 pm. The sky above Zeedijk at Nam Kee. This is my photo of you. Bye... That was it? I can't live without seeing you again! It's no use. I just can't do it. This is where I work. Drop by, if you like. Hi Berry. - Hi Dad! Don't idolise that man. He's not that great. Dad's all right. - He's not! Berry... What's up? Roof first, eh? Roof first... To the headmaster, Barlaeus High, Amsterdam... Our sudden move abroad... bla bla... means our Berry... Your curl isn't right. - That's not all. Thanking you in advance. Yours sincerely... No, cross country training tonight... What a life for an Ajax player. No sex before a match or training... I'm glad I'm a DJ! Party forever! Hey, Jamal. I saw you come in. - That figures. You spend all day working every street corner. Hey guys, I'm looking for kids who want a weekend away. You have shares in hooligans? - I'll just turn off the sound. Have fun in the Ardennes. Survival, rafting, you name it! Great! We'd love to call all our friends... ...but unfortunately my cellphone's run out. Here... ...call your friends! I'll have it back in two days. Ciao... Fine. See you tomorrow. - Okay bye Well... - Well... You still here? You want to talk about it? You? I hate people who talk about their work. What's he doing here? Lost? - Dumb bird. Come on. I live here. You can come up. This isn't it. An old lady rented me her attic. She's not home? She's in a care home. She'll never get out alive. Come on. Wow! Great. Where do you live? West... Slotermeer. - Nice... But in the only street of villas. Are you at school there too? -No, no. I'm at Barlaeus High... Well, I never... a swot... ...but I've stopped going. What do you do all day? You really want to know? - Of course... I was waiting for you. I'm going to sleep. You can stay the night. Morning. You found the daily paper I see? Quite some photos... Ben took them. - Ben? He wanted me to pose. It paid well. I moved in when we finished. 14 years older than me, he was German. He lived in a loft with a retriever. He must be the wrong type. How do you get on with him now? Can't be better. I never see him. Let's keep it that way. What can you see? Houses... ...roofs... ...beautiful sky... Lonely heights for you and me? Let them sort it out down there. Are you coming over here or not? Hey, Jamal! Are you okay? Don't come yet. Hey Otto! We're having a good time, eh? - Yes. What's good shouldn't last too long, Diablo. Understand? No... You will... Where have you been? We never see you. Jesus Christ! What have you been eating? Oysters. - They must have been dead. Are you hiding her from us? - Go training... Jamal saw you around town with a chick. - Possible. Hey... Aziz, doing okay? What do your friends think about the Ardennes? No, not this time. Hooligans do it in the road. They hang around... You think you're clever, don't you? But I'm not as satisfied with myself as you are. The Dutch are fascinating. - How about us organising a party? They'll all come. - They'll cause chaos. Not if I organise it. Okay... I'll see what I can do. By the way, my cellphone? Well, unfortunately... it fell in the lake. It's like this. There was this Moroccan girl... ...and she fell in the water and I rescued her. ...but she was kicking and screaming... ...and I lost my keys too. And that's a bummer. I did look... I didn't find it. You saved a girl. That's more important than all the phones in the world! You know her name? No, she only spoke Moroccos. Moroccos? You can laugh, Berry... - Not me. But this isn't high school. You have to work to succeed. What are you doing? You gonna pay the bill, Dries? No, Berry. Bye, guys... Bye, Dries! Fool! He had the money! Dumbo! This is our house in France. You don't have it any more? - No. That's me! You looked so sweet... Is that your brother? - Yes. That's my father. Handsome... Hey Berry! You were doing the barbecue! You can learn from that. Cheers... So you met at a school party? Yes! He watched me dancing. You like dancing? - Yes. And you're in photography? You're in Cosmo? Is that what you said, Berry? It was, wasn't it? - It was indeed Cosmo. Oh, the fish! - Fish? Great! Berry and I often eat oysters. Oysters? You eat oysters? Sure... Thera? Thera! You, here? It's okay. Christ! You shouldn't be here! Should I call a doctor? I want to go home. I want to be alone tonight. For you, Thera. Thera? Wait a sec. No, why should I? - Rubbish, Thera! I'll never desert you. You had quite a time. In your room. Your girlfriend needs a silencer. Rush hour... I won't be long. He's having an affair. Of course not. Don't talk crap. You can always trust me. I just wanted to teach him a lesson. There's always time for an ice cream! Perfect landing! Too late, it's his fault. One more time. What a little thingie... I'm not small. - So what are you? Big! Hold on tight! You can always rely on me. You could stop... ...doing that work. What then? - We could leave. Travel... To Denver. Colorado. Denver? - 1 always wanted to go. It's cold, man. "Things to do in Denver when you're dead." I want to go to Tonga, the last kingdom in the Pacific. A hut on the beach... Okay... Okay? Yes, okay. Really? - Yes. Okay! Then that's history. Me as a soft-porn model, exotic dancer... Time for a change. We do have one problem. What? -Money. Diablo, money's not important if you have it. We could start with a weekend in Barcelona. A cheap flight... I have 63.20 euro! Not enough to paint the Ramblas red. We have to get money. Lots of money. What about a dog-walking service? Brilliant, why didn't I think of that? A classic bank robbery? Too much security. Credit card fraud? Too difficult. What about your criminal friends? - No way. The perfect crime... ...is always based on your own strengths. My strength is that I can give men a hard on... ...at a distance, with my eyes. Told you so! Berry, this is Ben. It's finished. You are November. Ah. Thank you. Are you happy? Yes. Good. I know! I know what! I know! - What? A perfect plan. 6186366. Okay, thanks. Bye. I want fifteen copies. Thirty. - Thirty? No, fifteen. - Fifteen? It's up to you. - Fifteen. Hello? That's right... The rent is 1000 euro a month, 2 months in advance... ...plus 1000 euro key money, for a year. When you can come and see? - Friday. The first people are coming on Friday. We have time at 10. Okay, bye. Hello? It hasn't gone yet. Please, Dad! On sunny days... - On romantic evenings, this is... Okay, we'll take it. It hasn't gone yet. I think it's perfect for you. Well... what... ...do you think of it? - I quite like it. I'll take it. - Give me another fifteen. The key. - Thanks a lot. Christ, Diablo! 72,000! It's Barcelona, Denver and then on to Tonga! You have talent! You could go a long way in crime! Are you leaving? And if I'm lucky, I won't be back for a while. You and Thera? Right. Let's hope it works out! - It working, Rein! You could learn something. See you... Rein! The people in the country: we can't... ...disappoint them. Hilton Hotel, please. Come on. I want the John and Yoko suite! Really? - Yes! My wife wants the John and Yoko suite. Ben's dog was called Chivas. To Ben's dog! - Ben's dog! Okay! I'm John. - I suppose I'm Yoko! Okay. I'll be Yoko then! I want to fuck you, John! Nymphomaniac! Maybe I'll write you a song, Yoko! - Yes, and then we'll get married! Then we'll have kids and curse each other and then... ...when we've beaten the kids, we'll cry in harmony. Then we'll get out of a taxi in New York and some madman will shoot me. Just so you know. Beautiful... John? What do you hate about yourself? My ear. I say... There's nothing wrong with it. What's worst about a woman? If she smells like a hot dog stand boiled dry. How do I smell? The precise opposite of a hot dog stand boiled dry! We want to fly to Denver... - But first a weekend in Barcelona. And then to Tonga. When can we leave? How do you feel? All right... ...I think. Glad to hear it. What's up? Thera... - Leave me be! I won't be long. Oh, perfect! I'll fetch them this afternoon. See you later. Thera! We can leave in two days! We're leaving in two days. Herpes... We'll go dancing tonight. That's quite something. Boss? - The Armani Store... Impossible. You can't even get socks past their alarm. Listen. I tried it on... ...then had it wrapped up. You have some...? How much? I came to say goodbye. I'm going on a journey. Berry has a woman? - You fuck all day? Berry did his homework. Passed his exams. Let's test him. Berry fucks, he says. Then he's relaxed. No stress. You haven't fucked for three weeks. So you're as stressed as a door. We put you in go-carts, five rounds... If you've fucked, you'll drive him into the ground. I'll give him a half round lead! I'll beat him anyway. What are you up to? What are you up to, man? Get lost! - Did you try to push me? Get lost, man! Thera, I have the tickets. Frank Willis from Missouri. - Bruce's brother? Coming outside? What then? Come on. It's not cherry liqueur... It's fake! - So what? He asked if I'd dance for him. Frank Willis! He'll pay me 1000 euro if I dance for him tonight. Why? - Why not? Maybe Frank'll let you watch. Can we change the subject? It'd be good. Who for? - For you. For me... For us. No... Not good! We're going round the fucking world! Sometimes this drives me crazy. What does? All of this. You... Then get lost. You forgot your chocolates! Mr Willis... room 714. Which one? -714. Of course I won't dance for him. Then dance for me. You really want that? Yes. You're sure? Okay, what do you want of me? Just tell me. What do you want? You know the rules, lover boy. No hands. How much do you want? Tell me. How much? Everything. Fine. But everything is nothing. What do you want of me? Everything! You just don't get it. Thera! You don't understand! Thera! Hey! - Bastard. Thera! Come on, we're going back... ...to dance! If I dance for you! No, I'm sorry! - Get lost! Act your age, man. - Come with me. Don't come! Thera! Thera! Thera! Call an ambulance! Sorry, you can't come up. Can you provide the patient's details at the IC counter? Shit! Deep shit! Room service! It's sweet of you, but eh... You can come home tomorrow and we'll be in Barcelona this week. I'm back to square one, Berry. Barcelona, then on to Denver, Colorado... Wake up, time to die... I look awful. - You're beautiful. Diablo... Don't cling on to me. It'll be all right. Who sent the flowers? Ben... Berry? Yes? - I'm Thera's mother. It'd be better for everyone if you left us alone. E -Yes. Thank you. Hey Berry, are you back? He told you? Who? - Dad. What are you talking about? Go away. He has someone else. - Gripe to yourself in your room. He told us and was going to tell you in the garden. Shut up! - But he's a coward! You're lying, Rein! Dad would never desert us. And you never stole Mum's car. Here, a present. I stole it for you, from Metz. Berry! - Only joking! Mum? -Yes? Sorry... What for? I don't know why. Hello, Mrs Bouwman. I brought back Thera's things. Watch the palm! Nothing wrong with your family really. But? Some people are better off without a mother. Have you read your horoscope in Elle? It says things will be looking up. Everything will be fine. - That's last month's! No regrets, Diablo. Only regret the roles you didn't play. That's all you should mourn. The films you didn't play in. - Our film... ...has only just started. - No. No? It's all different now. Get it? - No! You really don't? No! I want to know what's up! Thera! Look at me! What does Holland know of these problems? Pizza couriers... Rum coke, please. Did you hear: a gang has been arrested in Tadjikistan... They'd had murdered 14 prostitutions... ...and then they ate them. That is so gross... Two Rum cokes... And your Thea? Thera... Gone. Look, Berry... There are two kinds of women. Women who are more interested in you loving them than fucking them... ...and women who prefer you to fuck them than to love them. Think about it. Shouldn't you be training? - I train myself to death... His ankle is buggered. His Ajax contract has been frozen. They want out. Christ! Dries keeps asking if we'll help out locally. What do you think? He hates you. Dries hates Otto and Jamal and he hates me. Listen, I can DJ at an event in the square. He'll give me 300 to buy CDs. Otto will be security manager too. What are you up to, man? You know the bastards want us for a multicultural puppet show! You talk too much! Jamal, it'll work out. It's bad now, but it'll pass. Jamal. Your time will come. You have to get over it. In a while you'll laugh about it. I'm finished with Ajax, don't you get it? I can get a job with the post office... ...as a postman! I don't want to be a postman! What do you know? Hey Berry, cool it. One step... ...and everything'll work out. Hey Berry boy. We're not stupid. Berry... Your Thea... Thera... - Where did she go? Did she dump you or get stolen? What's the difference? Can't you see? It bears his heart... his honour... Here, it's for you. It's a matter of honour and that's how to solve it. I just want to know where she is. - You'd know if she wanted you to. She doesn't want to see you. Is she with her sister? - Leave us alone. I'm warning you! She doesn't want you! Am Ben! Call me Mobile! Shit! Thera. Thera! Thera! Hello? Ben! - Yeah, that's me... So say so. What? - I am Ben. What's this? Is that you, Theo? Look at your mobile. Who's calling? That's my number! - Well done, Ben! Call! What are you doing in my house? - Say it, Ben! “I am Ben." Very good. You're Mobile, Ben, because I'm not! What do you want? - To sort out some things. But if you really wanna know: I want you! I want you, Ben! Filthy bastard! Get lost! Christ almighty! - New sunglasses? I have to go! Come on, Chivas. I, eh... I've been trying to reach you. Berry, please don't! How are you? Fine. Better... You? - Bad. I, eh... I can't cope. Some things you have to give up. - And some not. You can't cling... - Take off your shades! Please take the shades off. I want to see your eyes when you talk to me. Better? You have to give up things to get on. Is that from Elle? - It's from Thera! I went to Nam Kee. I don't like them. I never liked them. And still don't. - Then don't eat them. I want to eat them with you every day! - Shut up! Just hate me, Diablo. Just don't do it, okay? You can't do it to me. Or to yourself. You have to go. You mustn't do it again! I haven't changed and nor have you! - Really? You see me as you want to! I am what you think, but I'm other things too. Thera... Thera. Jesus, wait a sec. I have nothing to do with you. I'll take care of it. Leave us alone, Ben. Fuck off! - Berry, please! I see someone wearing the wrong clothes... ...in the wrong job... ...and who's in the wrong place at the wrong time. So you're wrong, wrong, wrong. - Oh really? Yes. That's enough. Put it away! Berry, please don't cry. -I'm not crying. Listen... We can't meet again. Okay? Are you listening? It's all over. You can never look for me again. Hi Berry! What are you up to? You're wearing Ajax gear! Just once. So what? Cool, all these people! You're just in time for the big show! - Here take it. I have to get rid of it. Fuck off with that thing! - I don't want it! It's crawling with cops. It's no fucking good! - And you are something! A round of applause... ...Jasmina doesn't know the dangers of water... Otto will tell us about it... Take it off! - As if your suit is so great. I'm going legal. This is my show. - He has you by the balls too. No messing, Berry, or I'll kick you out. The great Ajax talent... music please! The Mediterranean pearl of the West, Jamal! Hey, prodigal son! I'll switch on the sound. You can say something. Berry, it's me. Open the door! Berry, I came to fetch you! This way please, monsieur... Berry, the guy's recovering. He was in a coma, but it's getting better. So come out. Come on. Throw the pistol out and come out. We'll go away together when this is all over. To... ...anywhere you like! Berry, say something! Berry, the people in the country: we can't... ...disappoint them. Dummy! A card from Thera... I'm thinking of you, asshole... Did you know Thera was an Aegean island? No... - Volcanic. You checked. - Yes! You want her back? - No. Impossible... Not on. She was... incredible. We're having a good time. What's good shouldn't last too long, Diablo. Why not? - Before you know, you believe in it. Treat it like a party... Come late and leave on time. That's the secret. Get it? - No... You're sweet...
