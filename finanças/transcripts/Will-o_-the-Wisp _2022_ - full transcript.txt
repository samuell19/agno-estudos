A tree, a friend We need to take good care of A devoted friend As faithful as friendship That we can cultivate Look, Alfredo These are royal trees Nothing like the dump that is a republican forest. We have thought it over, Alfredo and'there IS a clear ontological difference between a royal tree and a common weeping willow Look carefully Look The intent,the discipline, I the order. The verticality, the rectitude Each royal pine is so self-aware, so aware of those around it and withstands benevolent pressure to be the best of the best. Aware of its royal status, Alfredo each one of them, from their roots to the very top, knows that the world will always be vigilant, watching for the tiniest slip-up which might refute its natural superiority We know the demands of this status, don't we my boy? we are what we are and the showcase ot what we are. Papa... You'd do well to take inspiration from these trees, Alfredo. See how they grow how they rise to the sky tumescent with sap quaking with the heat of the resin in those broad trunks, which i pull with their arms, all the better to perform their duty. So that life runs through them from bottom to top. and emanates the oxygenated gift to which we avidly aspire Until the day when, exhausted, they fall so that we might give them a second life.

Planted in the 13th century the pine forest was intended to prevent the advance of the dunes, and protect the town of Leiria It played a providential role in discoveries, supplying wood to the shipyards t had become a place of leisure It will take over ten-years to'grow back..

About me. It was there.

A "he " about whom I could say nothing So you hold your tongue? Yes. What about us? I can't, Afonso. Because you can't Sure The sacrificial lamb goes to the slaughter in public, so no one will be too unhappy.
