Subtitles exclusively arranged by:- Samaksh ~ Varsha ~ Pankaj Jain Seems like a horse ride. I have told you enough times not to come this way. Why did you choose this way? It's your wedding. - Yes. Yes, to marry you off. Isn't he right? Brother, there's only one way you can reach there on time. Otherwise you can find a helicopter. Time does not matter if it is a helicopter. But you have to use ropes to land there. Cheap! Then take me through the gutter in the nearby road. That is not possible. They tarred it last week. Yes, they tarred it last week. It is smooth now. He is naive. - A pit in front. Don't scare us! - Drive carefully. Hold somewhere. Stop, stop. - What happened? What was that sound? - Wonderful! Air issues? Open your eyes and see. It's a puncture, stupid. Don't call me stupid. What if I call you? - Don't overreact. Flat tire isn't something I planned. How am I at fault? I doubt you did it. - Then you drive. If it wasn't my marriage, I would've... - Don't touch my car. What if I touch? - Ramendran. It's been so long you're... You do your job. Change that tire. Change that tire. - I'm not going to travel with him. You don't have to. You take Viji and get on that bus. I will deal with this one. Don't spoil the day. - Come, Viji. You may fool your wife with a cheap wig, not me. Your wedding night will be a flop. Please don't curse the one who is about to have his nuptial night. You get lost! Don't worry, Viji. It won't be a flop show. Take your car back now. - I won't. We can go only if you give way. - Yes, that's right. You guys, get in there. Get in this car. - This one is air conditioned. Viji, come. Sit here. Come. Sit down. Nobody is offering him a seat. Poor groom! Ramendran, you may adjust somewhere here. No, thanks. I will stand here. Viji! Viji, switch on the motor. Yes, I did it. Viji. Just come here. Do that later. Get a broom with you. A broom? Listen. Dad. Didn't you watch the same episode yesterday? But I have few doubts in it. Now I will find out who is the real father of the child in this drama. What a pity! Witty! Go away. At first, it was not a problem. Then it disappeared. That panicked me a bit. Enough. It must be dead by now. Come out. I am not done. Stop using your phone, finish food and leave. I saw that. Can't you see? The tank is full. All you do is chitchat. You don't have to water the yard for two weeks now. Come with me if you want. There will be heavy traffic. Won't you have breakfast? I'm out of time. I will have it from Rahman's shop. Viji, can't you see those hens in the yard? May I? - Yes. Mom, did you wash this plate? - Deal with it. Enough. Did you take the certificates? - Yes. What about the other papers? - I have them. Did you take ration card? Ration card for an interview? Get rice and kerosene on your way back. Rice? - Yes. Mom, give me some sugar. - By the way, get some sugar as well. I don't want sugar. Hima, is this going to help him? What else can we do? I took him for counselling so many times. Did that change his anger a bit? But he is not angry at me. Such a short guy with such temperaments. It was a doctor's advice. If learning music can cool his temper, so be it. I fear he'd kill his dad some day. Ma... Pa... Dha... Ni... Sa... Sa... Ni... Ayyappa. - Swamiye. Swamiye. - Ayyappa. Do you come to music class to sleep? I was not sleeping, master. I was thinking about the notes of a new song. Do you know it, master? - Do you want to know it now? No. You may refer and let me know about it later. What? - Nothing. Oh my! - You have my blessings. Funny! I just came to pick my shoes. What are you reading? Obituaries page. Wait for your photograph to be listed there. Master, I will be back soon. - Where are you off to? I said, 'I will be back.' Music master! Jitu! Jitu, stop! Did you walk out? - Of course. Did she tell you anything? Please don't say anything. - No. She said, nowadays, you sing very well. Once I sang sitting in the toilet. Saying I have MG Sreekumar's voice, she brought me to this boring man. - There's a similarity. Ayyappa. - She is calling. Are you done with your music lessons? No. Why did you ask? Hima, please take the cow away. Don't get violent. Consider her illness. Take this vehicle. Drop me there. If this continues, you will be in newspaper soon. She is very fast. I booked that seat. You have to give me 2 rupees. Give me your bag. Here. This one too. What is this? Brother, hold this bag. Why are you staring at me? Everyone else has a bag. Except the driver. Come on, step down. Flowery attire, step down. Let's go. Oh My God! Is it curry? - No, stain. Did you think you can abscond from me? My name is Sinta Simon. I didn't abscond, sir. Then? I was scared. Are you finding excuses because I'm questioning you as a cop? Who do you think you are? If you try to play games with me, I will tie both your hands and legs together... Simon brother. Go. You are my mother's distant relative. Calling me brother, you borrowed money from me. How many days will I wait for it? I just look stern and classy. Do you know why I am sitting with half my back out? Piles trouble me if I sit. Knee-pain if I stand, if I pat here, I release gas through my mouth. Give back my money. Frankly, I don't have money. I will give it on Friday. Friday? - Okay. Hey, sweet after giving back my money. Rani, why did you get these sweets? Finally, the 31st marriage proposal is in my favour, sir. Great! Why not? For your marriage, I lit candles and prayed at the Paravetty church, yesterday. The Saint always answers our prayers. They want the marriage to take place within six months. Wonderful! That guy is calling. - Is it? Attend the call. Maybe, he is calling to tell you he wants to get married in six days instead of six months. Saint is so great! Pick up. Talk to him. - Okay, sir. Hello. Yes. - Varghese. How many times did I advice you, to light candles at Paravatty church if you want to have kids? Did you see her case? She got a nice guy. Sir, but my wife is in Kuwait. So how will lighting candles help? That's right! My life will end like a burning candle. Don't lose hope. Saint will show you some way. What happened, Rani? That marriage got cancelled. His mother didn't like me. Why are you staring at me like that? The groom's mom didn't like her. Yes, sir. What is the sweet for? Rani's marriage was just called off. No... If you want it, take it and leave. He is impossible! Rani, don't worry. They have opened a new church because of the crowd. Let's go there. They believe, the Saint is powerful. Okay? This way. Is that your vehicle? Yes, why? You will have to move it from here. I can't leave my vehicle under the sun. Then you may sit on it, holding an umbrella open. It's been years I'm parking over here. I don't want the birds to dirty it. Did I get my vehicle for free? You better leave, Ramendran. Ramendran. - Sir. Varghese, is he locked inside? - Yes sir. Sir, what is it? They fired at Karunakaran Nair. - Okay. They surrendered yesterday evening. They threw the gun into some lagoon. They simply have to throw, it is we who has to find out. Did you check the air? - Yes. Did you check the fuel? - Yes. Did you check breaks? - Yes. Will it break down? - Yes. What? Sir, has any car broken down when I'm driving? Okay. Move. If the gun is at some unknown place... Come on. Sir, foul. Sir, foul. Stop overreacting and get up. Go on. Your team players are good at overreacting. Coach, which is your team? 'Those who write revolution as poetry...' Argentina, right? There is no need of decorating it. Come on. Go. Smash it. Kick. Come on. Kick it now. No. Please don't overdo it. Is it the 4:30pm bus? Now, it is 4:30pm. Any problem with the time? - What? What is it with 4:30? - Nothing. What? - Nothing about it. Something is fishy for sure. Who is she? How would I know? One or the other! Give it to me. At least attend the interview on Thursday. I will. It has been almost an year since you're jobless. There is no value for a jobless guy from Dubai. You are repeating the same line for the last one year. Son, attending that interview is enough. Holy Mary will take care of the rest. It is a definite chance for the experience you have. Mom, I know that. I will go for it. Mom, aren't you tired advising him? No, what do you want? You go and learn something. Hey... Are you sure, it's her lunch box that stained your shirt? Yes, I am. Then make her wash your shirt. Yes. - Yes, good. Go and have dinner rather than advising me. I gave you the right advice. I don't want it. No. I don't want your advice. When I'm showing him the way... Hello. You had curd curry and vegetable fry for lunch yesterday? Yes, why? Half of that curry was on my shirt. You had trouble, right? Sorry. - Sorry? Come. Come here. It's okay if it is a Peter England's shirt. But I missed an interview to go to Qatar. So, are you jobless? I was working in Dubai. I came back to go for a new one. What more do you want to know? What do you want me to do? If you want, I will clean your shirt. You have to do that anyway. Hold it. Are you serious? - Yes, I'm serious. Washing and ironing... Look here. Make it fast. I'll be here only for a week. After that? - I'll go to Dubai. Then you may have to come there to return this shirt. Use soap. Bye. Who is that guy? I met him in the bus. Chandi. Vivek. Madanu. I'm Amruthesh. From Kuzhoor village, Vellanichira... You got it? The rain, river... Calm forests and all... I'm not here to talk about all of those things. Our collector Pushpangathan IAS, that rascal, our collector. Are you watching? I want to talk to you. You will delete my Facebook. Deleting accounts! Why don't you take up a job in some bank? You're here with Shasi Tharoor's English. Are you the first person to bag an IAS? There are a lot of IAS guys. Who do you think you are? Pablo Escobar wasn't this arrogant. You come here. Try to touch me. I'm right here, near my house surrounded by I'm standing here. Come here. You dare touch my hair! Got it, you Pushpangathan. Come here. Sir, is it a shoot-at-sight order for me? What? What is it? Are you taking to kill me? Kerala police won't waste a bullet that way. I'm getting negative vibes. Are you going to kill me? Sir, I have stomach pain. I have to go to toilet. Sir, please lift that back cover. - Sir, what? Kick this rascal out and end it. I will take the responsibility. How difficult is it to deal with him? Vehicle is having some problem. From Veliyaparambu it's there. What is the problem? Who knows? - Hey, if you didn't harm me then can I tell you something. What? - I think cylinder is not working. Carbon deposits can be there in the injector nozzle. Mostly you have to change the fuel injector. You didn't lift the back cover when asked. That's why. Don't you like favours? - Keep quiet. Sathya, come here. - Coming. Sir, you take him. I will check the vehicle and come. Okay. Sir, take him down. Some missing. Missing? Go. - It started from Veliyaparambu. A cylinder is not working. Carbon can be there inside injector nozzle. You have to change the injector. I will do it. If you leave the vehicle here, I can do it. Sir. I will... come back... Stop. - Get him. Stop there. Get him Ramaendran. Stop. Ramendran I can't run. There. He is running. Catch him. Playing games with police? Where are you going? Carbon in carburettor... Get on the Jeep. Come on. Take him. Get up. I will show you. - Take the vehicle. What? Are you playing games? Of course. Abusing collector is a game. Letting police run around the ground is another game. Then weed, hashish, brown sugar... must have such interesting games either. If it is not there, you will add it now. What? What do you say? Sir. What? This is our son. Sit. Tell me the truth. Who are you? Sir, even you question is wrong. In our lives, we were not able to figure out who we truly are. If you understand it, then you are a great person. You know. Did you see that bulging part on his head? Whether he got thrashed there in the past? No. - No? No. But something is really wrong with him. Sir, he won't make any problems from now on. We will correct him. Correct yourself Rascal. You have a women related issue in your name. I'm not recalling it because of her. Do you want to correct him? Anyway, take his sign, and take him away. Amruthesh, if you talk politics even in the toilet... I will keep silence if there is no violence. Oh My God! Sir, it is just that he talk big. He don't know the meaning of it. Explain him some meanings when you are free. Okay. That guy in white shirt, ask him to wait. - Ask him to wait. Sir, may I leave? Keep going. Tell me. No. Yes. Ayyappa. - Not me. Why are you hiding? Where is Sa, Pa, Sa? I don't know. Where is Jitu? He is depressed on missing an interview. Try calling him. Is it? Jitu. - Jitu. Jitu, open the door. Ayyappan is here. Ayyappan, you leave. I'm not in a good mood. So he is alive. Mom, get him out. What a show? Seems like you are missing an interview for the first time. I'm going. But today's match is with Pranav Abdulla. If you miss the practice... I will go nude. Match is at the cemetery ground. I'm depressed to hell, his cemetery... Go on man! - Mom said you missed an interview. I said, leave. Don't go over there. He is insane. If he throw something you'll be cut into two. Leave! Then try it yourself. Jitu, open the door. Come on. Open the door. Come get some food and go to sleep. His overacting show! Do anyone behave like this for missing an interview? Oh! Jitu is your name right? Didn't see you after giving shirt that day? I thought you have gone to Dubai. That won't happen. I lost that interview. - Sad. Then, I don't know whether I can say it in this situation. While I was washing to remove stains from the shirt, that shirt tore apart. That's a shirt. It's okay. Are you mood off? I was expecting that job. I missed that one. The Dubai going show became useless. I bought a new one instead of that shirt. The same Peter England. Here. I'm buying someone a shirt for the first time. Bye. Hey, don't worry. Gulf won't get locked tomorrow. It's too sunny. It's okay for an old bike to be under sun. Mine is safe now. Sir, Ramendran replaced my vehicle from the shed in the morning. Didn't you sort out that issue yet? Sir, I am parking there for years now. I have an attachment to that parking space. Police station is not the place for your attachment. Ramendran, isn't she a woman? Let her park her vehicle. Why? Doesn't men's vehicle subject to light and rain? Men's vehicle may get destroyed and rusted from light and heavy rain. But we have to protect women's vehicle. That's the situation, my dear Ramendran. It is not that I personally hate you. Rani, you go on. Sir, then why do we keep moustache as a matter of masculinity? Shave it then. Did I ask you to keep it? It's a waste talking to him. Sir, I'm coach Vijayan, I'm a broker. Are you a coach or a broker? We are traditionally brokers, but coach football too. What is your problem? I got a letter for over speeding. Letter? - Yes. Where? This one with a photograph. Placing hidden camera is cheating. You have to pay this in the court, not here. - That's not the problem. There is a girl behind this bike. That's not my wife. - What? This case is not going to end here then. Sir, this is not me and no girl have ever been on my bike. This letter came to my wife. She is not believing me now. Sir, you have to prove it somehow. I didn't eat for three days now. If it was a colour photograph... You turn that side. Do you want me to put a helmet? - No, that's okay. Hey, If you look carefully, it's you in the picture. Please don't talk to me like my wife do. Go to a lawyer and claim it is not you. The case will win or you will get divorce. One is sure. Then I will advocate it. A divorce is essential for me. That day, the accuse was drunk... Hello. Yes. Horlicks for dad? Really? I will recharge for the TV. Or ask Swathy to do it. I'm in Vadamel. I will call you back. Brother, what happened? Why do you want to know? Leave the past behind. What happened? Puncture. Out of air? Sad! Very good. Your false pride is the reason. Such a devil. You will always be in pain. I won't forget the past. Blow it with your mouth. Ramendran, it is a nail. Such a bad luck on me. It is not just about the puncture. Sudhi came while I was changing the Stepney. His laughed and mocked on his way. Who? Driver Sudhi? Yes. That guy. Can you make it fast? Aromal, Take this Tyre off. Quick. He was in Bombay, wasn't he? Who knows where he was. Make it quick dear. Jitu, get that stitched blouse from Lalita. Is it your selection? No, a friend gave me. What all do you want to know? - It's good. Is it? Really? - Yes. Hello. Bus is about to come. Come on. No. I have bike. Okay. Swathy. I thought this shirt will match you. But this is not up to the mark. That's okay. Come fast. Not you, you can look that side. You had exams, right? How do you know? - No. You have ink stain in your hands. Oh! That was good. You know... - Yes. In your St. Mary's College one of my friend's brother is studying there. Rahul is his name. Do you know him? We are in women's college. It's not brother, it is sister. Sister Rahul? Rahul is not sister... but... Her name... Swathy, I love you. I got it when you repeatedly wore this shirt ten times. Okay. Happy. Nothing else. Keep looking there. Look that side. Give way. I want to step down. I need to step down here. Stop. Okay then. - Bye. Punctured again? Yes. How careless did you fixed it before? It's unfortunate. What will I do... 'In which stage of evolution do I become you.' That day I will serve me love form you. What's it? - What? Your Facebook status. Who fills your bike's petrol tank? You or she? Petrol pump worker does it. Give me some peace. Let me eat it. What is this? Did a bullet pass through? Sir. - Quiet. All because of you. - What did I do? Will you be able to do something? He is not picking up the call. Call is not connecting. Sir. - What? Sir, can we leave? Please. For what? To play again, right? Betting in card play is wrong. Did you understand? - Yes. Betting in card play is wrong. Sir, I got it. Hey, wear that. Why are you silent? Didn't you get it? Sir, I understood. Sir, he got it. Please ask him to give back our money then. Let them play to get it back. So, are you planning to go back and play? Sir, please leave us. - Keep quiet. Ramendran, what's up? It will take some time. Sir, we will not walk till station if the Jeep is not repaired. Then? - Book a taxi. Taxi? - A rickshaw is fine. Uber is also fine. Let them go. This is the same nail. Someone have purposely used this caltrop. What caltrop, Ramendran? Otherwise this won't happen. Take a look at this nail. If these new type of nails, are deliberately targeting your Tyre, what could be the reason? There is a lot of vehicles here. Why should someone target me? You have ask that to the one who is doing it. There was someone like this near to my mother's house. He puncture other's vehicle and he repairs it. Aromal, please don't spoil your own food. Finish your food now. Do some work now. Oh My God! Who has such problems with him? What about consulting an astrologer? This is not a usual human thing. Dear dad, please don't scare like this. Anyway he is restless. This will add to it. Does anyone dare target a police vehicle? Hey, his Tyre got punctured again. Oh My God! Like I said, This is not a human thing, but some other unknown power. Oh My God! He have to use holy strings for protection. My peace is ruined. Most of the punctures are from Parappuram-Kuzhoor area. One puncture every day. That's his course. This is beneficial for me. This is my food. Everyone is selfish, isn't it? Don't worry. A normal person won't dare do it to a police vehicle. This is a crazy, jobless person doing it. Do you suspect anyone? Crazy, jobless guy... You got it Pushpangathan? Amruthesh. - Who? That one who abused ex-Collector? - Yes. Possible. I suspect it. How do we fix whether he is doing it? Can you do something? For me, will you spy on him? Me? - Yes. Okay, I will do it. I came back after a holiday, not into a Police station, but to my own home. When I was not there, you took care of my home like a garden. Thanks. Thank you everyone. Ramendran, what about today's caltrop? No, do you want one? I want to tell you another thing. When I was not here, From my room, two Lexi pens, a cigarette lamp, some cashew nuts for time pass, etc. Someone has stolen it. Stealing is an offence. Whether it be the one in lock up or the one here, whether the one in uniform or not, put it back in place before I return. Ramendran, - Sir me? Not you! What was it for? Okay, let's go. Come. Sir, cashew nuts? - Not the plain cashew nuts, but spicy cashew nuts. Hey, please stop. Come on, stop. I was trying to figure out whether it's moving or it's parked. CI have ordered me to reach there in 30 minutes. I'm going to take his yelling. Why should you care, right? Go fast now. Pathetic guy! What are you saying? Targeting you with a caltrop? Sir, it is true. Who are you to be targeted? Minister? Sir, I'm dealing with it for last whole week. There is no issue when Vinod drive it is there when I drive. Because Vinod know how to drive it. That's it. Sir, just look at it. See, it's a nail. Variety punctures everyday. If it is in lemon today next day it will be in banana. The other day it will be in a potato. What does it mean? I think, some vegetable store guy is taking revenge on you. Sir, please don't joke. Yes, it is a joke. You say heavy dialogues. Which dialogue? - Have you ever seen a break down when I'm driving? For the last one week we have only seen break downs instead. Sir, a department level inquiry is needed. Kerala police is busy right now. You do one thing. Ask CBI to enquire about it. Change the Tyre and come back to the station now. Sir, I am... Go to the station. Sir, I'm in a hurry. I have headache, so I couldn't use helmets. Not for that. You just drop me in the station. For headaches, avoiding helmet is not enough. You have to use Vicks or Amrutanjan. Hey, Amruthesh is here. Is it? I got a puncture scene again. Where is he now? Near the Rahman's tea shop. What is he doing? He took a nail... He took a nail from the road. Then? He is observing it carefully. Is it? He is really attached to nails. Then? Sad. He threw it by the side so that no one will get hurt from it. Did you attend the interview I asked for? Yes. Why are you staring at me? Why are you lying? I'm not lying. The practice here is going on. It's tough if we didn't make it. I will not get through that interview. Do you know why I'm not roaming with friends of my age? Do you know why? My parents will marry me off. Leave job. How can I ask for one who can't even attend an interview properly? Swathy, wait for some time. If you are Irresponsible and jobless, when my parents marry me off to someone you and your friends will say, she cheated on you. Hey, What a speed! It's going to break down anyway. Take your time. Come slowly. Not always sir. Once in a day. Just once. Do one thing. Puncture it in the morning. Then come for the job. So that nobody gets affected. I don't know sir. What you don't know? How can I send you somewhere? Gets punctured wherever you go. How do you have these many enemies? What are you all waiting for? Go, do your job. Rani, come here. - Sir. That guy without helmet, fine him 1000 rupees. Hey, if you ride without helmet... - No sir. I won't. Ramendran, come here. Ramendran, Take a gap for sometime. Sir, what do you mean? - Leave. What? Most importantly, there are two reasons to do it. One is the safe journey of Police vehicle through roads. Secondly, if there is a mysterious caltrop guy because you are on leave, will feel 'I couldn't puncture him today.' Thinking that way he will feel wasted, misspend, useless and stop it and go away. How is my idea? I have to think about it. - How? Sir, I want to think about it. - Then come and take the Jeep. No. I am too tired to get stuck in between. Vinod. - Sir. Vinod. Sir. - Come. Okay then. How much? One minute. What are you looking for? - My phone is missing. I put it somewhere here. Where is it gone? I will call. Here it is. Oh! It was there. - Yes. Ramendran, it is... - It is... Caltrop Ramendran. Good. Caltrop is the carpel of a plant. You will find it a lot in the south. It is full of hard spines. It can even puncture the small Tyre. Caltrop? Means? Make it fast. Sir, this is a silly matter. It can be solved if our Panchayath member repair gutters in our roads. But he have to do it. Caltrop is like a nail placed on a piece of coconut husk. Nail won't be visible. Just in a light way. - Then? When the vehicle cross over it husk go down and nail hit the Tyre. Sathya, hop in. What happened? Punctured again? Not just that. Get in. Take everything you need to fix a puncture. What is it? Mobile Puncture fixing? What happened man? I haven't faced such a big trouble in my life. I haven't done any deadly sin to pay back like this. Don't laugh. A puncture daily is the routine. I will take the puncture today. Get in. Hop in man. Rahman. - Yes. Give him the breakfast. What is it Ramendran? Get two Aapam and Beef fry parcel. I will go to Kuzhoor junction and come back. In five minutes. Be ready with it. Okay. What is your plan? I'm clueless. We are going back. If anyone in the market is doing this to me I will get it punctured on the way. Okay. Let's go. I got it now. Yes. It is punctured. The prey is there. There. Missed him right? I knew it from his speed. How fast he is? I got his wallet. Look at this picture. I don't have any idea. It can be his childhood picture. Is it of any use? I know who it is. I will get him. Stop there. Stop. You rascal. Oh My God! My son. Sir, Sophie... Madhavan... Please come fast. Oh my banana tree. Why are you running? You saw my Facebook live and came arrest me right? Facebook live crap. Are you the one who puncture my vehicle by caltrop? Caltrop? Don't beat him. Sir, please don't beat him. He is going Bangalore today evening. Please don't do it sir. - Is this wallet yours? No, it is not his wallet. Look at it. He wasn't this good as a child. This is not him. Sir, leave him. - Yes. Please don't beat my son for no reason. Just because he is crazy... - Your dad is crazy. Leave man. Crazy. Give way. - Sir. Move aside. - Are you going? Come, let's run. Sir, come on. Tell me the problem. Let's call the police. - Isn't he the police? Let me tell you one thing. He is not a professional. He is trying from what he know. Caltrop is not just this one. This is somebody we know. Someone who is there only for it. Usually placing a caltrop is like using barbed wire, nail fitted on a board, then proper caltrop. He has used it all. Even if it make punctures, there is an art in placing caltrops. That is not here. That means? That means... Nothing... That's not here. That's it. Inexperienced. Ramendran. - Yes. I want to say something. - What? There is something mysterious about him nowadays. Yes. I just said. Don't harm him. Dear Ramendran, are you mad? How do you know all these details? How? - Because I deal with punctures. Kill me if you don't believe me. This is why people say, you are becoming mad. So, you are not the one? Ramendran, look at it. This is my food. I will promise holding it. I am not that guy. Football means... a round thing like our earth. We can kick football with our legs. But we can't kick earth with our legs. That is the difference between football and earth. You got it? If you make brokers as coach this is how it will be like. Ayyappa. - Yes. If I say, you don't have self-discipline... I will smash your head. I was just kidding. - Kidding with me? I'm out of mood today. Let's meet tomorrow. Why did you come now? Don't smile. You don't attend my calls, respond to my messages... So what? Nothing. What's it? Coming Friday we have unit anniversary. There is a music program. Will you come for it? Will you? Yes. Yes. Yes, will come. How can I say no, if Neenu call me? Neenu? If Veena call me. Veena? - Not Veena. Okay then. Ayyappa, it is Swathy. Swathy. Please don't mind. He is not normal. Ayyappa. We will come for the music program. Will come. Ayyappa. Do you have similar nails? Yes we have. How much? I don't want it. But, who used to buy these nails frequently? Frequently... Carpenter Babu, Sebastian who does Aluminium fabrication. Sali, Rajesh, Philip, Lilly... Frequently? - Whom do you want frequently? Who is it? Do you give cow dung from here? No, we don't. For no one? - No. Do anyone take cow dung from here? - No. I mean, who take most of the cow dung here? We are not giving cow dung. What do you want? Brother, a little cow dung is there under that coconut tree. Take it for free if you want. For free I mean. Don't you want it? Ramendran, don't worry about it always, come outside for some time. Keep quiet. I'm becoming mad. Will it be alright if you stay inside? There is no peace anywhere. May I ask you one thing, How will he get to know who is driving the Jeep? What is it Ramendran? You are down. Sir, it's okay. What is it? I'm tired. Tired of life. Is your duty time over? Go home. Mr Shinto asked me to come. I'm just clueless. I couldn't sleep at night. Sir, is there a problem? Now, there won't be any problem. Don't worry. Stop smoking. Now leave. Okay then. Ramendran, eat something. We have to go to temple in the evening. Hey, Who is it? Who wants to dance? Move. Move this side. Leave him. Leave. Get up. Ayyappa. Wait Jitu. Why did you create a scene there. I didn't create it. He pushed me. I pushed him back. Why did you come after me? To tell you something. What? What? What is it? It's okay. Police will handle it. That guy who came, is my brother. Hey. She is crying over the phone. What is your problem? Why are you avoiding her? Her family is looking for a match. She may suicide. Trust is the most important thing in love. Ayyappan. I need to tell you something. First, you talk to her. Come up now. There is Nadurshah movie's shooting is going on in the junction. Come. Not that. - What? What is your problem? Tell me. You know Ramendran. - Which one? The guy who intervened while we started a fight that day. Police. Yes. He... - He? I... - Yes, you. I made him Caltrop Ramendran. What? Do you know how I missed the interview for Dubai? No. Brother, a Puttu and Beef curry. Beef is not ready yet, what about curry? Hey, Catch him running. He is taking your bike. What? Who? - Ramendran. Where? - There he is going. Stop there. Are you playing with police? Get in. I was angry at him. I was thinking to repay him. Even Grandma told me... - What? Police or Army never mind that. Isn't he a driver? Give his vehicle a puncture. She is such a witch. Still, didn't you know he was her brother? You are lying. I didn't know. - Liar. Believe me if you can. I didn't know. Then... - Then... Is it? So you don't want to know about me? - No. No. But I want your full details. Swathy, I don't want to know your past. Your family, religion, nothing. I loved you, only you. Shouldn't have used philosophies to be romantic. That day, during the music program I get to know, he is her brother. But why did you continuously punctured him? One or two were enough. First, it was the anger on him. Then when I found it is safe, I keep doing it. Are you a minister to be targeted? When I found him in pain, that gave me pleasure. For pleasure, I must have bought you a half bottle liquor. How will we deal with it? Sir, please take the sweet. Sir, - Yes. Sweet again. Why? - My marriage is fixed again. Oh My Paravatty Saint! - Sir, you must come. Okay. Rani, I will definitely come. You must come a day prior. Sure, I will be there. Do we have to donate to the government for it? Sorry sir? Some donation through beverages. - Definitely sir. Sir. It's been so long I got a salute smiling. The case of blasting bomb in the convent pig farm. Sir, what about my leave? - No way. It's my uncle's death anniversary. Is it uncle's death anniversary? Still, there is no leave. Sir, what is it? I just asked for a day leave. Ramendran is already on leave. If you are not there, what will I do with the vehicle? Sir, it's unfair. If Ramendran returns, police station must change its name to puncture station. What can I do about it? What can Ramendran do about it? He is uncontrolled now. Like the Mammooty in Thaniyavarthanam movie. A cigarette. Caltrop. Caltrop. Caltrop. If I didn't get the one who placed caltrop, I'm in a mood to finish off the one I get. When my cigarette ends, I should not see you or your bike here. If you go there asking for his sister... This is my your head, this one mine he will kick both into the pit. Even I got two punctures too. So it was you. Which job can we expect a 100% perfection? I heard a lot of others got affected from this. He wouldn't have seen me. That's what you think. He is a policeman. He must be having assumptions. Ayyappan, give me some ideas? This is my head, this one yours. Don't spread heads like this, instead take my head out of it. I swear I won't puncture any vehicle in my life. He took long leave hiding for a month just because of you. How do he know whether you stopped placing caltrop? How do he know? Do something! Or... Or else, I will hang myself on that post. That post? That post is short. Ayyappan! - Just a fact. You need strength like mine to play football. Or you will fly with the ball. Let's arrange this proposal. How? Let's get the broker. Did you get what I just said? We will be there by 4 O'clock. Yes. - Then what will you do? I will bring you tea and smile. Do you really understand what I am saying? If you smile, your brother will doubt it. Why are you excited to get married? You have to protest. You must say, you don't want marriage. What? - Won't that stop our marriage? That's what I am saying. For that reply, your brother will say, Anyway, they have come this long way. Bring them coffee. Let's think about it later. Then what will you say? I'll do it, just for you. Don't think I will agree to it. Then come and serve us coffee. That simple. Please don't overact and spoil everything. I'm tensed. Don't worry. Then, I didn't get it. What? That, I didn't get it. Give me. Yes girl. - Is your brother there? No girl, it is my dad. Okay, let's see on Monday. I have seen Jitu somewhere. Come, let's leave. I have seen you somewhere too. While going to place caltrops? Quiet, Ayyappan. What's the secret? I was saying, you are quite famous nowadays. I took them here because they are a perfect match for you. He is a gentleman. But he is not that good in football like we are. We are two, mom passed away. Yes, we know. How do you know? - They told us. But I haven't told you any details? Is there anything that brokers don't know about? They will figure out everything. Have it. Look at her carefully. After wedding, don't blame me saying she has this and that. Alright? - Keep quiet please. Jitu, where were you in Gulf? Qutar. I came back to shift this job. I got selected for few companies. There is a confusion, which one to go for. If they want to talk in person let them talk. It's not the old age. This dialogue is copyrighted for brokers. Don't try to act smart there. Let them talk if they want to. Your wife passed away right? There is a good lady in Kettam, Airanikulam whose husband is dead. Can we think about it? Let's plan it with their wedding if you are interested. I'm interested. But I don't think they will agree to it. Let's make them agree. What are you doing? I will take this. I haven't tried it yet. I liked the girl. Let them decide now. I have done my job with sincerity and perfection. Isn't it mother? - No Vijayan. You were boring. You wouldn't have told me that on my face. I performed it very well. Isn't it? I will treat you for this. I will make you stand in the ground hands tied to the goal post, pour weaver ants on your body, and put fire under you, to play penalty game on you. Creating useless scenes! Did you like him? I don't want to marry now. You have to. My job is problematic. You marriage is important for me now. If you want, I will marry just for you. You don't have to marry for me. Marry if you like it. Then, let's go for few other proposals. That's not required. I have promised, to accept the first guy's proposal. I will marry him. He is a nice guy. I like him, he is good. Let's inform them we are visiting their house next week. Let's decide after looking at their family and backgrounds. Okay? - Okay. I couldn't be able to come there that day. - Why? There was a music concert in Delhi. At the age of three, I learned the martial art practices by heart. I used to sing well too. But family didn't figure it out. They endorsed me to dance. The song and dance didn't go well altogether. It's time. Can we leave? Wait, Jitu will come now. He went to the yard to collect some vegetables for you. That was not required. Who is it? - It is Jitu. He was is 8th standard that time. Can we leave then? Didn't your wound dry? That pains once in a while. What about the alliance came for Swathy? Yes. - How are they? Can we expect it soon? There is a problem. It can be my assumption. What is the problem? Nothing, but... I have a doubt that whether he is the one puncturing me. Are you mad? It's because you are always thinking about it. What is the reason why you think that way? Hello, what's it? Don't forget to buy medicines. I have to remind you everything. But you didn't give me the list. You put that in your wallet. Try to remember. Oh, is it? Let me see. It is not here. It would have gone out for a vacation. Don't hurry. Let me see. Got it? - Yes. I will buy it. Sure. - Okay. Okay. Why do you think he is the guy? Hey, where are you going? Not that, he had a lot of head weight when he came home. Head weight? He didn't accept the vegetables I gave. He could be a non-vegetarian guy. Ramendran. Mr. Ramendran. Let him go his way. - Ramendran. Here. Come here. - Let him go somewhere. Who are you scared off? You are brother-in-laws of future. You must share a relationship. I will arrange it. He is a nice guy. Look at his innocent face. Don't overact. How are you? It's good we saw you. He was waiting to go to that junction. Drop him please. - Ayyappan. I was waiting to see you either. - Is it? Go on. See. This is how brother-in-laws have to be like. What a timing. - Hop on. Go on. See you both, soon. Brother, is this bike pretty old? Yes it is. Don't worry. Nobody punctures this bike. I have such a bad name in the village. You must be aware of it. It is good that I saw you. I wanted to ask you something about the wedding What's it? For wedding, whether meals is good or Buffet is a good option? Buffet is costly right? That's why this confusion. For your social standard, I think buffet is the better option. You want my money spent? Not like that. For Buffet you will get the remaining food. We can use that for the next ten days. That's good. - Yes. But, does that brings the joy of local dessert? Okay. Meals is right. Meals is good for health too. Meals is good. But for my social standard, buffet is best, isn't it? What a man is he? What? - What was it? Why are we here? You must be knowing it. Someone is puncturing my vehicle. That's why I'm home taking a long leave. Do you know who it is? I have a clue. He is almost caught. Stop there. Hey. I won't leave you. What was that sound? It can be some stray dogs. Oh, you fall down. Brother. I will kill you, rascal. Brother, listen to me. I'm the one who punctured your vehicle. But you must know why. Take me from here. Listen to me first. This is what happened. I know you will finish me off if you get hold of me. But I won't let you die here. I'm not that cruel. I will save you. Help! Somebody help! A poor guy slipped into this well. Somebody help. He will die now. Help. - Yes, people are coming. Come on fast. Let's save him. Not behind me. He is in the well. Go rescue him. Go on. Is it Ramendran? Get a rope. - Okay. What happened? A wild dog trapped me. Now, do you think you will get her? It is better to end life than losing her. Don't say such things. The way you talk! I have only done two things sincerely in my life. One was puncturing his vehicle. Other was loving her. Can you just stop. Grandma, what will I do now? Now he will do the remaining. Grandma! That's why I told you to apologize him. Try to convince him doing anything. I can only think of that way. After creating such problems... What did you say? I did it right? I have told him, you advised me to do it. After advicing all plans... You told him? Yes. What happened? Done with investigation? I'm canceling my leave, and planning to join next week. What about punctures? That is sorted. Did you catch the culprit? No. But I will. That is refreshing! Why did you call yesterday and said no to that alliance? That won't work. He is a jobless brat. I didn't like the family too. Did you tell her? No. I don't think she is going to agree to it. I think they were in love. She will agree to it. What are you going to tell them? I will talk to him. What is this? Cat is chasing that rat. Hey, why did he call you for? I don't know. Will he cancel the wedding? You were puncturing police jeep all these days. He can put a charge on you. Or he can slap on your face. I'm expecting a murder for the craziness he have. I didn't mean to worry you. Yes, you are repeating words that can end my worries. I was reminding you about the situation you are in. Let him do anything to me. But, I can't lose her. Then why can't you take her to some other place and live happily. That's not possible. Do you think she will leave her family and come? Whatever. It's a waste talking to you. Can I eat Horse-Gram to reduce weight? - Horse Gram will reduce. Whose Gym is this? His brother-in-law's. Take care. - For what? If he hit you with a dumbbell you will be done. Stop it. I was just saying. Go on. If you are alive I will be waiting at the ground. Come there. Ramendran. Caltrap Ramendran. Call me that. Brother, that just happened. We already had that discussion. When are you going to Qutar? Do they kick you out from there? I can charge you with two cases, if I want to. Puncturing police jeep, and fraud for marriage. But no, if people get to know, my sister is going to get married to the one who punctured me, I can't bear that. Swathy know about the job issues. I was thinking of marrying her... - Shut up! You trapped me there too. She is ready to hang, if she won't marry you. I was thinking a lot about what will I do with you. Then I decided to follow your ways. Sometimes centipedes are more dangerous than snakes. If you don't want me to charge this, If you need Swathy, You have to do whatever I ask you to do. I want to see you losing your sleep. I will do anything for Swathy. You tell me. Tomorrow is your Kuzhoor 11's game. Today we will find out who are the kings of Highlands. Final tournament for 1st Venkidi ever-rolling Trophy is going to start in quite some time. For tomorrow's tournament... - Do we have to lose? That you play as usual, you'll lose it. Not that, Then? He compromised? I can't believe it. What did he told you? You have score self-goal. What? Not just one. But two. If I do, they will kill me. That's your problem. I can't do this. You can. He ignored it that way? And said all the best for this match? - Yes. You punctured such a nice person. You are really cruel. If a third person get to know about these... you will not get Swathy. All the best then. I will be watching it from the audience tomorrow. A treat for your eyes, with all the strength and support, players are about to hit the ground. Last year champions Kuzhoor 11s, can't decide whether they can be able to lift, raise or take back the trophy home. This is not a game with the hands but with the legs. Ball is flying, players are trying. We don't know where it is going to end. He is passing the ball. Ball is with Ayyappadas. He is not like others. Here is a pass. Ball is now with number 10, Jitu. Oh, Jitu! Jitu scored a self goal. Why is it happening Shyju? If we can't make it to their post we score it to our own post. To be frank, you need a skill to do that. Shameless! Receiving appreciations from the viewers, reinstating victory from the side, here is Ambujakshan also called as Tiger Balm. Ambujakshan is passing the ball to Babu. Babu passing it to Marthandan. Marthandan throwing it after a confusion. Throw is returning to Ayyappadas. Ayyappadas is going forward. That's half time. - Yes. I just missed it in a minute. What are you doing in the ground? It was a fault. - Why can't you make fault there? For that... - What are you... People are watching? I'm here as a coach to talk to him. What are you doing in the ground? Let him not play the second half. Do you want Vivek to play? Accepting failure is better than that. Make us win the match or let it lose it. I have an alliance to attend after this. You'll say this. Kuzhoor 11 is played by just 7. Let's win this match first. Then fix the alliance. Investing money doesn’t matter. Pass it, pass it. Second half of this excited game have just started. Ayyappadas has given a kick. That is missed. If the goal post was there, it would've been a goal. But unfortunately he missed the chance. Still it is 1 - 0. The ball is rolling again towards the goal keeper. Goal keeper is taking it. The number 10 Ronaldo kicking Self Goal. What the hell is he doing? I'm going for some other work. Coach, please don't go. Let the game get over. He is shamefully standing in the ground. He is playing well. What are you doing? Are you mad? Why did we practice then? I doubt whether there is such beautiful self goals. Who among us bribed him? Why coach? He is playing more passionately than us. Where are you... Don't play with me... Go away. Let the game get over. Can we go for alliance? Our team will lose now. Let's go after that. Is the girl beautiful? Let's go and see whether she is beautiful or not. Come on. The excited match started again. Ayyappadas is leading. He is taking the ball forward. He shoot and the ball fly. Goal! Ayyappadas scored for Kuzhoor 11. There is only ten minutes left for the game to end. Real fighters - 2. Shyju, where is Jitu gone after the Self Goal? I doubt whether he know about the change of goal posts. Anything will happen. Ball is with Ayyappadas. Ayyappadas head the ball to Goal. Ayyappadas again. Let's see what will happen in the few minutes left. A game to be played in Europe or England. Ayyappadas is giving you such performance. Ball is with Ayyappadas again. Someone fouled Ayyappadas. He is in the ground. There is fight happening in the ground. There is a chance to get a free kick. Yes, there is a free kick given for fouling Ayyappadas. Ayyappadas is going backwards. Anything can happen. If he make it to goal... Ball left Appappadas's leg... Ball is flying. A beautiful goal. Goal! Goal! Kuzhoor won for 3-2. Never come back. Now, nobody is with you. Now, you have to do everything as I say. You will. What happened? I think your brother is not liking me much. Nothing like that. He likes you very much. Even yesterday he spoke about you. What did he say? That he got such a nice brother-in-law. That's not possible. Hey. Hey. - Yes. Sometimes, his way of questions and talking... His vehicle has some puncture, or some related issue is there? Sometimes it feels like he doubt I have done it. Why is it? - Never mind. After that puncture issue, he is like this. But he is good at heart. Yes, good at heart. Good. Where is he now? What are you doing there? Come here. What? I said, come here. Are you mad? A bathing scene, dad? Hey, Well has enough water. Use it. Inner peace is real happiness. Swimming pool would've been more convenient. What kind of a dad are you? Come here. Ramendran, when are you going to come back into the station? I will join next week. I have few more works to do. Okay. What should I do next? Tell me. You don't have to do anything. I quit. - What? I lost the thrill. You poked me, I scratched you back. That's it. Over. So what will I do? You can leave. Brother, what about the marriage with Swathy? That we will talk later. I will take care. So there won't be any other problems between us, right? What problems? You don't have to worry. You can leave. Jitu, one minute. What is it? Do Swathy know you were puncturing my vehicle? No, she don't know anything. Then, just tell her that. What do you mean? Anyways, you are going to live together. It is not fair to keep a secret in between. I like it when she get to know about it from you. Brother, it is not a joke. I she get to know about it, she won't talk to me anymore. I will deal with it. I will talk to her. Brother, I did everything you told me. This one... I can't do. Yes, you can. You don't have another option. What do you think? I will. Then, go on. Everything will be fine. Swathy. I have told you not to lie. I can tolerate anything else. Swathy. Brother, one minute. One minute. Okay then. I told her. She left me saying she don't want to see me. She is not picking up my calls, can you please talk to her. Did she tell you that? Yes, she left few minutes before. Then, I can't really help Jitu. You told me our issues are over, you will arrange the wedding etc. Wedding? Do you think I will marry her off to someone like you? Then, why did I do all these? You were... Are you getting angry? You told her the truth, don't you? Brother. - You can go. Leave. Now, If I get to know about you disturbing her saying all these... You would’ve told me this before? It was difficult to approach you. Okay. Open the door. Jitu, please open the door. Hima, let this thing end. You open the door. I will not do anything. I was scared, so... What is the need of locking me in the toilet for that? He won't let this marriage happen. I'm afraid whether he will put those charges on me. Ayyappan, I'm afraid. He got back to work today. What is her status? She has blocked me from everything. She is not even attending my calls. Ayyappan, I want to talk to her. What else to talk? Do you dare going to her house? Will Ramendren be there? So what? Do you dare coming with me? I will take you inside that house. After Rani Madam's wedding, within a week she joined back. Hey Ramendran. You put on some weight. No sir. No, there is some change. The gun in Karunakaran Nair's case have to be submitted in court. Varghese will accompany you. Or should I ask Vinod to go? No sir. Will there be puncture again? No sir. I will go. You have to accompany him. Ramendran, what really was the puncture issue? Sir, that is... I will tell you later. It is a long story. So there is something big. But I can be sure about one thing. There won't be another puncture. What is it? Let's see. What happened? Ramendran, it is a puncture. Before you could finish it, another puncture. Hey. Stop there. Missed him. Come. Such a bad day. Oh My God! Ramendran, the gun. Gun? - Gun is missing. What will we do? I expected this when I came with you. I should have asked Vinod to come. Sister. Sister. Do you recognize me? Good, she didn't. I'm OHC's agent. Automatic Hen Cage. We have developed a new type of Hen Cage. Automatic Hen Cage. Normally, the hens in the normal cages, eat everything from ground and die. But the hens in our Automatic Hen Cage, they will only pick and eat essential and healthy food. Because we have inserted a chip in its neck. There is a bell facility available in the Automatic Hen Cage. This bell starts ringing at evening 5:30. Once it makes sound, like the school kids chickens will queue up to the cage. The door will automatically gets shut. For those hens who can't make eggs will be trained by roosters. Even if any wolves comes hiding, we have a CCTV facility to find that out. If any wolf comes, hens will bark and let us know about it. No, by clucking it will let us know about it. Something will happen now. Even if hens fight each other, we have a clip to insert on the beak of it. Hey Jitu. Keep quiet and listen to me. Jitu, it is over. What do you know? Your brother is not a saint. Quiet? He was making a fool out of me saying he will agree to our case. Whatever happens, morning at 9:30, there will be hen's assembly. Please don't cry. I want you. What do you know? He wont let us be together. Ignore him. Are you ready to come with me? There are different types of hens, Rhode Island Red, Leghorn chicken, Sussex chicken, Plymouth chicken... We raise all these hens the same way. A disciplined family needs a hens cage for sure. Or else there is a chance of thieves and foxes breaking in. I don't have to think about anything else. I will call you. But this Automatic Hen Cage is good for all types of hens. That's what I meant. I didn't understand anything. Do you have a video of it. Video just got deleted. I will show you some other day. He will be waiting. - Who? My partner. I will show you some other day. Bye. I'm relieved. She's fine. Then what about Ramendran? Ignore him. What will he do? I will take her home. She will come. This is what I'm asking you to do. Who did this? I will call you back. It's serious. What happened? Somebody punctured Ramendran's vehicle and took his gun away. Took his gun away? Who? You. - Me? Not you. Even if I'm in his place, I will suspect you. But, I didn't do it. What if they say you planned it? I did it? I will call him now. Jitu. Ramendran, I'm Jitu. What you did now, you will pay for it all your lifetime. Brother, I don't know about it. I didn't do it. - Shut up. You can only do that. Criminal case will be filed upon you. Listen to me first. - Are you playing games? I won't let you go. Is it solved? Ayyappa, he is trying to trap me. What will I do? You don't have to do anything. Escape. There is no benefit in staying here. Why should I leave? Nobody wants to hear your defense. Try to escape from him as soon as possible. Where will I go? Go to your uncle in Coimbatore. I will join you in two days. For what? You called him from my phone. Varghese, I don't want to listen to your justifications. CI will come now, explain to him directly. If you can't carefully transport a gun, why are you in police then? Sir, I have a doubt. Oh, do you have doubts? Who is it? His name is Jitu. Jitu? Who is he? Sir, the guy who is going to be his brother-in-law. Super! Dear Ramendran, are you mad? I'm alright. But, I want to tell you something. Which place is it? Some Mayandimukk or something similar. I will figure it out. Even if you find it or not, don't come back here. Live in some lodge there. Do you have money? - Yes. Okay, agreed. He punctured your vehicle. But how is it related to this? This is a straight case. It is the only evidence against them in the shoot-out case. If they destroy it, they can walk out of the case easily. Why can't you understand it? I avenged him in return. That's why. Revenge! I haven't seen such a mysterious person ever in my life. Sir, inquiry is progressing. Okay sir. Okay sir. Okay. Okay sir. Ramendran, you are in suspension. Varghese too. Rani, as head constable you are in charge of the station. Sir. What about you? I have to take leave. Where is she? Why? - Where is he? I don't know. He won't leave without your notice. I don't know. I'm not going to tell you even if I know about it. He told me everything. Didn't you show all your anger on him? Now, do you want to put this charge on him too? I'm failed in all ways. Don't try to fail me again. If you are talking about my marriage. That won't happen. I will go with him. Swathy, you have to wait for me. I will come for you. Is Kathakali about Gokarnan's story? - I don't know. Dad, gun! Where? - There. I will give you a slap. Come with me. Yesterday it was Nalacharitham - 4th day. But festival started just 2 days before. - That's right. Tomorrow we have match. If you stand here, you will sleep in the goal post tomorrow. Today we have Ramesh Pisharadi's mimicry. That's why there less crowd today. Hey, who asked you to come here? I want to see Ramendran. What you got were not enough? I want to see him. I want to beat him up. He is just in suspension. He is a policeman. You will be trapped. What if he is police? I can't come to my place now. Anyways, I will be behind the bars today. Before that, I will beat him up. Then do it. He will be near that stage near the music troop. Beat him up. You are right, It is not puncture he deserve, thrashing. Rascal... Jitu... Hey... Ramendran. I told you many times. Ramendran, leave him. Ramendran, stop. Ramendran, you are trapped. Will you drive me from my place? You will thrash me in my house, in front of my mother. Don't you? Stay here. Amruthesh stopped coming in live. Now, it's just live action. A gang from outside. It is dangerous. If anything happens to Ramendran, it will come upon you. You bring the crowd. I will take care of it. Stab him. Ramendran, the gun. Don't leave him. Karunakaran Nair. Evidence, job. Don't leave him. Move. Where is the gun? Did you shoot Karunakaran Nair? Which Karunakaran Nair? Who? You took the evidence to be submitted in the court. I will... - Hey, Keep quiet. I'll finish you off. Produce him in the station as soon as possible. Everyone leave. Go leave. Do I have to tell you specially? Go on. I took him here. Now he is asking me to leave. Ramendran. Like you said, the mysterious man. There is no even 1% mystery in me. Everyone tortured me as much as possible. Now I can't take it anymore. Ramendran, I have arranged everything for us to join next week. Okay? Is he your puncturing brother-in-law? Can we arrest him? No. I will deal it. Okay. As you wish. See you then. - Okay sir. I won't give you. I will not give you my sister. Why are you all so silent? Being such a pleasant day... Say something. How sad! Dear Ramendran, don't keep this pain and pressure, use a caltrop to burst it. Wedding is over. I mean, if there is some pain inside, speak up and finish it here. Don't let it enter your home and your life. What to speak out? To avenge for a small issue, you forgot one thing when you punctured every time, even I have a small world to lose. You avenged your anger spoiling it. And made me caltrop Ramendran. It is just because of her I... Ramendran, just take it off from your mind. It was a mistake from his part. I don't have that wide heart to consider puncturing 35 times as a mistake. I'm sure about one thing. If you have tried it once again, I would've finished you. Or else, I would've turned mad. Eighteen. - What? I have only did it 18 times, not 35. The one at the Kuzhoor elevation was my last. After that, I haven't done it. Really. Promise on her. Swathy, I didn't. Trust me. Again Ramendran. Puncture. There is work to do. Run after him. Otherwise, this will be added in your account. Brother... Caltrop Brother... My Brother.
