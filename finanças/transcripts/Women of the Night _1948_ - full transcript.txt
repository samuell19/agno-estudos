UPSTANDING WOMEN SHOULD NOT STAY OUT PAST DARK. Welcome. Still no news from your husband? No. Are your parents and sister still in Korea? I've had no word. They must be back by now, but they don't know I had to move. What a shame. You have nobody to turn to. And my little boy has tuberculosis. I don't know what to do. Would you buy these, please? Summer clothes. Summer clothes... aren't worth much, you know. How about 600 yen? Couldn't you make it a little more? It's already too much. Business has been bad. And taxes are so high, I might as well hang myself with these old clothes. Please, just another 50 yen. I really can't. Please. Just enough to buy eggs for my little boy. Try the other shops. They won't give you more than 500. Here's 600. Listen... if you want to make money, I have a proposition. What kind of proposition? Earn money occasionally instead of selling your stuff. You know of a job? I'd do anything. I know a man with a lot of the new currency. I'll introduce you. Will you go see him? Will he lend me some money? That depends on your skill. Just give him a night he won't forget. What are you implying? You should meet him. Everyone's doing it. Do I look like that kind of woman? Don't make fun of me! Hello. I'm back. Well? How much did you get? Six hundred yen. That's nothing! I had no choice. Fusako... I know you're mad at me. I'd help if I could. But I don't make much. It's all right. I'll take care of my boy somehow. I brought you some apples, dear. I'll grate them for you. I bought some eggs too. He's your son. You have to take care of him. You think I should stop drinking and help out. Well, it doesn't work that way. I came back from years at war to a burned-down house. Now I work on the black market. One slip and I go to jail. I should at least be able to drink my booze! I give all of you 6,000 a month. We appreciate it. The kid doesn't need all those shots. The doctor pushes them because it's profitable. - He wouldn't do that. - They all do. We had X rays taken. It may mean nothing to you, but if my son dies, I could never face my husband. Where is my brother anyway? Is he even alive? I wish he'd hurry and come back. Please forgive him for saying those things. It's all right, Mother. If my son were well, I could work somewhere. Nothing is going as I'd hoped. Please, let's drop the subject. Mother, Sister, did you hear the radio? We don't have one. Somebody has news about Brother! What did you hear? I was listening during recess. They said they have news for the family of Keisaku Owada. They said to contact this man at Kuriyama Trading for more information. This is wonderful news! Thank you! - Shall we go, Mother? - Yes. Kumiko, would you look after the baby? I hope he's okay. He was very ill when he got to the refugee camp. He hated having to die after surviving so much. This way, please. These are his things. His uniform was in tatters, so I left it behind. I'm sorry to deliver such news after you've waited so long. Excuse us. - What is it? - They heard the announcement. Really? I'm glad you found them. This is the president of the company. We're sorry to bother you. Not at all. It must be a terrible disappointment. My condolences. But as they say, perhaps our meeting was predestined. Come see me if you have any problems. Keep your spirits up. Thank you. So my brother's dead? Our last hope is gone. Isn't that right, Mother? We'll have to borrow money for the funeral. Mother, look. He's having convulsions. What on earth is happening? I'll get the doctor! Please hurry! Please hurry! It's time to go. We'll go on ahead. Fusako! Is that you? Natsuko! Sister! Finally! I looked for you everywhere. I'm so glad you're well. I'm so happy. Natsuko, this is Kumiko. She's grown up, hasn't she? She certainly has. Kumiko, you remember my sister who was in Korea? She's changed so much, I didn't recognize her. When did you come back? September of '46. Your house had burned down. I couldn't find you, and I forgot where your husband worked. I didn't know what to do. How are Father and Mother? And they well? How are they doing? - They're both dead. - Dead? Mother died before the war ended. I came back with Father. They both died of malnutrition. It was terrible, absolutely terrible. I lost my husband and child too. Your husband too? What are you doing now? - I'm a dance hostess. - That's great. And you? I didn't want to burden my husband's family anymore, so I asked the president of Kuriyama Trading for help. He was kind enough to hire me. She's the president's secretary. It's really great. Maybe I should quit the factory and work somewhere else. I can't buy a single sock on what I earn. Where are you living? In an apartment in Tengachaya. May I move in with you? I'm sharing a tiny room with three other girls. It's so crowded. I'd hoped to have a happy home when we met again. I didn't imagine it would be this bad. It's true. Still, you're lucky. Why? There was no war when you were young, and you got married. The war ruined everything for kids my age. That's not true. Did you have that nice dress made in Korea? No, I got all my clothes here. It's very nice. I'll bet it was expensive. It was. I had to borrow, and I've only paid off half. I'll be a dance hostess too. Don't be ridiculous. Welcome. You have company? Please come in. Natsuko, this is my boss. This is the sister I've been trying to find. We ran into each other today. I thought I was dreaming. How nice. I was concerned when your sister told me about you. Much obliged. It must have been hard. THE HOLLYWOOD CLUB Just you and me and boogie-woogie Love songs make my heart throb We'll dance the night away As the lights swirl around us A rhapsody in the City of Rainbows If only I could dance. I'm ashamed of these clothes and these shoes. - Let's go home. - No, I want to stay. Your mother will be upset if you get home late. It's wonderful here. Good morning. Fusako, don't use my makeup. Don't be stingy. You're the stingy one. Buy your own. They're the tools of my trade. I don't make much. Even as the president's secretary? That's disgraceful. Tell me, haven't you made an "arrangement" with him yet? Don't be ridiculous. He's a sucker waiting to be had. He's not that kind of man. What's that? The boat arrives tonight? We need to get three million ready. I'm counting on you. Okay, I'm on my way. Someone might come. It's all right. You're my secretary. - Sir... - What is it? You want a present? It's not that. Do you really care about me? Of course. Really? What's all this about? I'm just a little worried. Don't be. I treat you well. What more do you want? All right, I'll be even more affectionate. Miss Owada! Where'd the boss go? I didn't ask him. What a mess. What is it? Nakata just phoned. The cops are coming to toss the place. - Toss the place? To do a search. A search? STOREROOM They mustn't find this, but I can't leave. What is it? Can I help? If you can hide this somewhere, we'll be all right. - I'll take it to my place. - Please do. - Can you manage? - Yes. Thanks. Miss... your coat's dragging. Thank you. Excuse me. Did Natsuko go out? - No, she should be there. - Really? Natsuko. Open up quick! It's me. What are you doing home now? What's going on? Nakata called. There's a police search. I brought this to hide it. Put it somewhere. Just put it away. Natsuko, what were you doing? Nothing. Don't lie. You can't be so reckless. With Father and Mother gone, I have to look after you. You know that. There's no hope for me. I was raped during the evacuation. I wished I was dead so many times. Only the hope of being happy when I got back here kept me going. They should have just sold me off to someone. Maybe I'll become his mistress. - Did he ask you to? - Yes. I'm not a kid anymore. Let me do as I please. Natsuko, think it over carefully. Leave me alone! Hello there! How are you? I've been worried about you. You're very kind. Did your husband make it back? - No. - I'm sorry. But life is easier without so many responsibilities. You poor thing. Ma'am... about that proposition you mentioned last time - Are you interested? Isn't she back yet? Hello there. I'll check at the Owadas'. Maybe she went over there. Where could she have gone? Did you sleep with my sister too? No, never. Then why did she run away? How should I know? Fusako, is that you? Hello. I was just coming over. Is my sister there? No. She's not? Did something happen? She hasn't come home for a few days. Hello. How are you? Make yourself at home. Good-bye. Kumiko, what's going on? I've run away from home. I had an awful fight with my brother. I'll find freedom and happiness my own way. You shouldn't have done that. I stole some money from home. Can I stay here? That wouldn't be fair to your family. Besides, they'd think we led you astray. Fine. But that won't stop me. Kumiko, where are you going? Let me go! Need lodging? I know a good inn. I live here. Oh, I'm sorry. You want to go somewhere? I can get tickets. I haven't decided yet. Are you really a student? I'm trying to save up for tuition. I can't go to school if I don't work. Have some sympathy. That must be tough. You're from Osaka but don't know where you're going? Did you run away from home? That's right. That's not good. I may not be much help, but tell me everything. I'm worried about you. I'll take the day off just for you. How about a cup of tea? I know this place. They can make anything. Really? But I'm afraid I'm broke. - I wouldn't make a poor student pay. - You'll treat me? Pops, two chicken-and-egg bowls. You've got a mark? Promising? - Not really? Ran away from home and has some cash. I'll have a taste later. Don't show your money in here. Looks like an easy mark. I'll say. Come sit down. You can relax up here. There's some beer. You want some? - Maybe I'll try some. - Want to? Your food's ready. - Thanks. How much? - Two hundred yen. Let me. We took a beer too. - All right. I'll keep this for you. A hotel runner and a runaway girl meet for the first time at the train station and sneak away together. It's kind of romantic. It's true. Have some. Go on. Shall I help you? It's all right. Have some more. No, I can't. It's all right. I feel dizzy. No! No, don't! See ya. So long. Kiyoshi! I'm done with you. Get lost. Kiyoshi, wait! Kiyoshi, wait! He's not coming back. It's our turn now. Take everything off. Who are you? Bad girls. Can't you tell? Now strip or you'll get hurt. Please, don't! Hurry and take all her clothes off. I got her shoes. Take everything off. The skirt too. No, don't! Give her some sandals. Wear these. Sorry, tough luck. I can't go back like this. Please give me my clothes back. I'm cold. Quit whining, dummy. Either go home or join us. You can see Kiyoshi too. Let's go. You coming? Hurry up! Natsuko. I'm not sure if I should tell you this. - What is it? - Don't be too shocked. Come on. Stop teasing me. - I saw your older sister. - Where? Abeno. Where the streetwalkers are. Streetwalkers? Going home, mister? Have a safe trip. What hole did you crawl out of? What are you staring at? Get lost. You're in the way of business. Cops! You're making a mistake! Let go of me! No! Let me go! Get in there! Let's go! Where do you work? - The Hollywood Club. - The Hollywood? A dance hall, right? Do you have a pimp? You don't understand. I was just looking for my sister. - You mean a fellow prostitute? - No, my real sister. Your real sister? It's your own fault for being in such an area. I'll have to send you to the hospital. How much do you make? I'm back, old man! Don't look so serious! That was a surprise roundup! I saw the head of the security patrol go by, so I asked him for a light. He told me they had matches at the station and ran me in. That was dumb. Yeah, the syphilis has gone to your brain! We haven't seen you before. Where you from? You have to pay me the proper respect. Say your name when I ask for it. You can't work unless you do as she says. Say it! I won't be bullied by the likes of you. You're hurting me! - Say it! - All right. My name is Natsuko Kimishima. I humbly ask for your favor. You should have said so before. We wouldn't have hurt you. Get up! There's your bed. Fusako! Why'd you come here? It was all a mistake. I was shocked when I heard you were doing this. I came looking for you. Fusako, why are you doing this? If you needed money I could have helped. If it was something else, you could have told me. You're my only sister. I can't see you like this. Shut up! You know very well why. How dare you talk like that after stealing my lover? I hate you... but I hate men even more. This is my revenge: Infecting them with disease. Are you really here by mistake? Well, you're out of luck. Cry all you want, but they won't let you go until they examine you. You haven't slept, have you? Get some rest. So you're clean, right? That's what they said, right? Doctor! They say beautiful white flowers can bloom even in the depths of a coal mine. If these girls only knew the beauty of chastity, they'd never dream of falling to such depths. They blame society and hard times, but it's the impurity in their hearts. You gonna feed us, lady? How'd you like me to punch you? We ain't doing this for fun! That's why our purity association is working nationwide to - Sorry if our impurity offends you. Doctor, about Natsuko Kimishima. The one I just saw? She's my younger sister. Yes, she told me. Now I understand. Is she sick? Yes, she has syphilis. She's pregnant too. Pregnant? Take good care of her. I understand your opinion, and I agree to some extent. But many problems can't be solved that simply. Take that girl, for example. Yes, it's Kuriyama's child. I had no idea. My periods have always been irregular. I just assumed the nausea was a hangover. I used to think I didn't want a child, but I feel differently now that I'm pregnant. The doctor said the baby will be okay if the syphilis is cured. To think I'm carrying a child - Fool! Wanting a child with a bastard like that. The baby's innocent. I can get out if someone vouches for me. I'm going to call Kuriyama. He'll vouch for you too. Let's go home. Let bygones be bygones. You go if you want. Count me out. Give it back! Thanks. - Fusako. - Ah, are you here? - How are you? - Same as always. Cigarettes? No, give them to the others. You want to shoot up? No. Tell me what you want. Thanks, but I don't need anything. How's business? Bad? Not good at all. I'll starve if it doesn't get better. You have children? I had two sons, but they both died in battle. Really? Sorry to hear that. Why are you talking like that? You going to quit? You mean go straight? Don't be silly. Don't worry about that. Take care. I'll be back. Thanks. Kimi Yamada, Michiko Takenaka, Rie Ishida, Nobuko Furushima, Fusako Owada. - She flew the coop! - Good for her! How about it, handsome? Are you crazy? At this hour? You just don't have the money, jerk! What's that? You heard me, chump! You better watch your back! The cops really grilled me. I don't need this crap. Say something. You could at least apologize. I'm not talking to you. Why not? I saw my sister. She told me everything. You think it's fine, don't you? You're disgusting. What's that? She was a widow in need, and lonely without a man. I was doing a good deed. I deserve thanks, not blame. I was kind to both of you. You couldn't find a more thoughtful man. She's a streetwalker because of you. She's a fool. I was ready to support her. She'd have become a whore without me anyway. We're not animals, you know. I can't stand your face. Then get out. There are plenty of other girls. I can't go anywhere. Why not? I need to get better first. And... And what? What? Spit it out. I'm going to have a baby. You're pregnant? Are you glad? Get rid of it. You really mean that? Yeah. The sooner the better. I know a doctor. Let's go. - No! - Come on! Hello. Bad news, Kuriyama. We have proof you're smuggling opium. That's absurd. I have an arrest warrant. You have no proof. Even the smart ones slip up. We discovered your scam in Sannomiya. That led us to you. Get ready for at least two years inside. Let's go. All right. I'm coming. Is she your wife? No. She doesn't know anything. In any case, we'll need you as a witness. Come on. THE HOUSE OF LIGHT OPEN TO ANY WOMAN WITHOUT FRIENDS OR A HOME You looking at that? Don't let it fool you. You know something? You know Omitsu, right? She ran away from that place. Why? The rooms are good, the director's a nice guy, and they give you all you can eat. Sounds pretty good to me. Yeah, but you gotta work. That's no fun. And they're constantly watching you. You thinking of going straight? Don't be ridiculous! I was just looking. It's worth it if you get real sick. You can run away once you get better. What is it? You look exhausted. I hear you've been working a lot recently. Careful you don't get sick. What's it to you if I do? I don't even care myself. Maybe I'll just die and be done with it. - It's you! - Hello. How have you been? Is Natsuko in? Yes, but she's - What is it? Mr. Kuriyama was arrested. She has no money and can't work in her condition. So what's she doing? She's desperate, drinking with men she brings home. I finally found a lover A hand-me-down from my sister A fleeting affair A sad fate My mother remarried and now I'm a stepchild Fusako, long time no see. How you doing? I heard everything. It's hopeless. Let me join you on the streets. Don't be ridiculous. Want a drink? Get your things together. You're going to have your baby. Let's go. - Where? - The home for women in Senriyama. Forget it. I'm not going there. Shut up and come with me. Get up. What are you doing? I said I'm not going. Forget it! When will I ever be a bride... Get up. What are you doing? Ladies, the director is here. - Welcome. - Good for you, ladies. I see you're all working hard. Keep up the good work. I wanted to lift your spirits today, so I brought you a present. What is it, sir? Something that'll make you fart: Sweet potatoes. You all like sweet potatoes, right? Isn't it better here than in the hospital? Yes, but it's boring. Don't say that. Good things aren't always fun at first, but they become enjoyable if you're patient. How's your health? Much better, thank you. It's all because of you. Keep up the hospital visits. Thank you. You got a cigarette, sir? Sure. Keep your spirits up. Even after we find work for you, it won't be easy, but don't ever give up. Oh, it's you! Doctor, it's nice to see you. Nice? You gave us quite a scare. I'm sorry. - How long have you been here? - I just got here. You changing your ways? No, I just brought my sister. I thought she might have her baby here. She just started having pains. You think the baby's on its way? Is that her? Please do what you can. Natsuko, the doctor's here. Help me get her into that room. Natsuko, hold on! Bring a tub and hot water. - House matron, I'll need your help. - Yes, sir. She's only eight months along. Will it be all right? You can't stop a baby from being born. Wait outside now. You can't be here for this. - Has it been born yet? - No, not yet. Otaka, you had a kid. What was it like? Really awful. - So you're happy when it's over? - Yes, when you hear it cry. Be quiet! That's right. You ladies should give it some thought. Regardless of its parents, a baby is innocent. Life in all its beauty struggles to be born. This is our great and exalted calling as human beings. Should a body be trifled with, or bought and sold? Well? We know it's wrong, but preaching won't help. We try hard to go straight, but men make us their toys. I just want to get even with them. And have you? What's left of you? A body that's been bruised and defiled? We delivered the baby. The mother's fine. What about the baby? The mother was still too ill for the child to survive. But at least the mother's okay. Natsuko... I'm sorry. But maybe it's better this way. Don't take it too hard. Babies that premature don't live long even if they survive delivery. I'll have a baby someday. Next time I'll get married and have a fine, healthy child. I will! That's right. You stay here too and get your life in order. Just because you've been defiled doesn't mean you should let yourself go completely. That's right. You two must become new women. Don't think just of your own happiness and virtue. Work on behalf of all women, and create a world where their virtue and freedom can be protected. Fusako... Looking for a good time? I know a nice girl. How about it? Feeling feisty today? No, thanks. I can give you a good deal. What do you say, sir? Wait a minute. Some girl is walking the streets without our permission! - Where is she? - Over there. Go on. Fusako, come on. - Where? - The burnt-out lot. What do you think you're doing? This is our territory. Think you can make fools of us? We'll show you! Bring her here! Who do you think you are? Where do you get off working in our territory? That's enough. Where are you from? Show your face. Kumiko! What are you doing here? Nothing. Let me go! Let me go. - Fusako, what is it? - Nothing. Leave it to me. I heard you ran away from home. You can't stay on the streets like this. I'll take you home. Come on. What about you? You're the biggest whore of them all. Leave me alone! I'm young and I'm gonna have my fun. I guess the beating I just took settles the score, so let me join you. I've already spent time in the slammer. Then come on. All right then! Wallow in this mud! Come on! How do you like that? Little smart-aleck! Get sick, go blind, have your nose rot away from syphilis! Watch yourself rot inside and out! Then have a monstrous freak of a baby! Ruin all the men in Japan, and all the women, every last human being. You fool! Fool! Let's go home. Where are you going? Planning to go straight? If so, we'll give you a little farewell present. Answer me! Go ahead. Beat me, kick me, do whatever you want. I've had enough! Aren't you afraid of what you've become? What? Fusako! There mustn't be any more women like us ever again! What? - Come on, girls! - Let her have it! Take that! How's that! Get up! Take that! Take that, goddamn it! Stop it! That's enough! What's the use of torturing her? Didn't you hear her? We did. As of today, we're sick of this life! Why can't just one of us be allowed to go straight? Fusako, run! Don't ever come back. Live a respectable life. Sister, we don't know what to do. Help us! Help us! Fusako! Let's go home. THE END
