Arthur, if you don't come to The Last Stop at midnight, I promise you, I'll go and tell your wife that I just left my husband to take hers. I won't wait all night. He better be here on time. Don't worry, he'll come. Miss? How about a game of pool? So, where do you come from? It depends. The place I live? - Well, yes. - Biarritz. In the south, near Reims. A friend of mine lives there. - Right! Are you from here? Yeah. Orleans, 45, present. So, tequila or vodka? - Vodka. - I knew it. Here, darling. What are you here for? I'm waiting for a friend. "A friend"! A friend? In this jerkwater place? What about you? We're selling a car we stole. Shut up! What's wrong with you? Chill, Phiphi. Who cares! Now back off and let me play. How do you know I'm not a cop, Marcel? - I'm going to lock you away. - No, I'll lock you away. - Hear that? Sarah, what are you doing? I'm playing pool. You'll see. It's a cool game. - Who are they? - Natives. Phiphi was going to shoot... Number 13. We were talking about it. Phiphi! Play, buddy! You're not playing? - Is it true what you said? - What? - You left SÃ©bastien? - No. Not yet. I don't understand. What's all this about? You didn't like it? It depends what part. I wanted to see how you'd manage. Come on, you think it's funny? If I'd done that to you, you'd be mad as hell. If wishes were horses... Yeah, then beggars would ride. I get it! I feel immortal now. Sarah, what are you doing? - Do you have change? - What? Come on. Follow me. Sarah! Damn it. I can't believe this. Are you out of your mind? What are you doing? - I want some music. - What? I wanted you to listen to some records. That's why you made me come here? Look at me. Sarah, look at me! Why are we here? I wanted to listen to The Beatles. I'm tired of this. No, Arthur! Let me explain. Remember our first night together? In London. - Yes, and? - I had made fun of you at the restaurant. Remember? You were really mad. That was until I finally got you to dance to a song by The Beatles. And that famous slow that you ended up whispering in my ear. From that moment, I knew I would love you forever. But I wouldn't leave my husband. Arthur, I would like to listen to that record again. The slow was I'm So Tired. Will you open the door? Hey, what are you doing? And here? Stop! Would you have loved me in the sixties? No, I think I would have banged your sister. But who cares. Life is now. If I died tomorrow, what would you do with me for the next 4 hours? I'd make love to you for 4 hours. What if I died in 40 years? I'd make love to you for 40 years. Same thing in both scenarios? Yeah. So I could kill you slowly, for as long as possible. Arthur... Yes, Sarah? I'm scared, you know. Stop... Fire Consumes Aerotrain Dream I chose the wrong train too, you know. It's not a matter of choice. They wanted me to sell my patent. I understand. What about you? What are you running from? - Like you, I lose control. - Patent issues? Fulminant glioblastoma. I have an inoperable tumor in my brain. Cancer.
