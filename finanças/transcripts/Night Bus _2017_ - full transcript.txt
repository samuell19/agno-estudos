[wind blowing] [person singing] Why does the ticket price go up? I don't know, Ma'am. How about my granddaughter? How old is she? Four years old. She must pay, Ma'am. [singing continues outside] Hey! Why are you taking this blind man's picture? If you tell me, I can give you a beautiful smile. Let me take your picture. Move a little bit to left, Sir! One, two, three. Is it nice? You can see it yourself, so you won't blame me for lying. You are funny. - Thank you. - Yes. Where's my cigarette? Put it on my bill. Put it on my bill. It's just you. Laila, please apologize. - I'm sorry, Sir. - Okay, go! Take her, Ma'am. - Come here! - Yes, Sir. - Give me some water. - Water? Here you go. Would you like to buy a charm? This is a lucky charm. Do you want to buy this, little girl? - Let's go, Laila. - Do you want it? Cigarette, drinks. Here. What is this? Oh, man! These things made me regret, why didn't I study hard in school. What is this? In here, which one says we can go? They wrote it down wrongly. How could it be? Ouch! Your head is the problem. Put it inside here, okay? Sampar! Last bus! Let's go! Let's go! When love blooms, the snake comes. Let's go! - Let's go! - Hey Bagudung! You're such an attention seeker. Don't just help the girl. Help that lady! Okay. This is your bus. Let's go, Ma'am. We are leaving. Get in. If you're hesitant, just go back. Hey, what's wrong? Come on! In the name of God. Be careful! It's hot in here. - Where are you going? - I have to get off the bus. How come? Okay, let's go. - One passenger just left. - What? One passenger just left. It's okay. We leave now. In the name of God, the Beneficent, the Most Merciful. [orchestral music] Dear passengers, let me introduce myself. - My name is Hartop, Hartop Sinaga. - Hey Bagudung! Only Amang can call me that. No joking around. It will be like on the airplane. This bus is heading to Sampar. The journey to Sampar will take 12 hours. It's important to know that the incident occurred two weeks ago has left a deep scar in our heart. Sit down! Just relax. Two weeks ago, a conflict broke out in Sampar. But, don't worry. Everything has been resolved. There has been negotiation and our journey is safe once again. Is it really safe? Those who are new to the journey, don't worry. Incident like this has occurred since... Since... Since Amang was still in his mother's arms. Ouch! I'm sorry. These incident happened at least two or three times a year, isn't it right Mr. Stick? He is asleep. Finally, I'd like to say thank you. Please pray according to your own faith, and the most important thing, get your tickets ready. Please give your phone to the village head. I already had a quarrel with my mom and dad over this. Stop it. I will be there before sunrise. - Yes. - Ticket? How is it? I already gave you last time. You need more? Oh, my God! I'm like an ATM machine. Come on, you could sprained your waist, Ma'am. You sit here, okay? Tickets, please. Send them away. Thank you. I won't be long. [indistinct chatter] Sorry, I was trying to capture the cliff. As we approach Sampar, there will be more cliffs. They are beautiful but prone to landslides. They can't make anything without money. Isn't that right? That's all for now, okay? This is what it takes to be the most reputable man in the village. The village head even asked me for a solution. Isn't it great? - It's great. - It's great. The solution. Oh, my God! Those young people. Those young people. [tense music] That's a good book. That book inspired me to be an Anesthesiologist. I can carry morphine and make the patients high. But, I'm not smart enough. Yudha. Annisa. Are you a doctor? Co-Assistant Doctor. For which hospital? Montani. Were any of the victims from the incident taken there? How many of them? Excuse me. Ouch! Oh, my God! It helps me feel warmer. Share me a little bit of your drink. Okay. Cheers, Hartop! Cheers! I've grown suspicious of you. Perhaps you are not really blind. You must travel to Sampar quite often. Actually I'm not going to Sampar. It's another six hours by boat to Haba island. Haba islands? There is no male there. All female. Pretty and sweet-scented. Once upon a time, all the men went to war. No one returns. I was still young at the time, I stayed behind, rather than shooting my fellow-men. Until today, the most handsome man in Haba island is still me. Give it directly to the Commander. I know. - Hey! - Good afternoon. - Romi! Get two people on board. - Yes, Sir! Have your identity card ready! Good afternoon, Commander! He's a spy. - Do you start operating today? - Yes, Commander. We were off duty for 10 days, my savings is thinning out. My wife has owed money to many people. Thank you. Since the last incident, there has been two negotiation. No decision has been made. The Sampar party is still enraged. It will be better for you to travel when a ceasefire is agreed upon. - When is that? - I don't know. It's okay. Is there any more bus to Sampar? As far as I know, they will travel tomorrow or the day after. The permit was just released today. I have to go home because I miss my family. Help me, please. - I leave you with one person. - Yes, Sir. He said he was looking for his missing friends. - Missing? - I have no idea. Are they missing on the road or in Sampar? I already told him. If someone is missing, there will be a report. He insisted to look for himself. - You can go. - Yes, Sir! Just sit over here. Did they ask you for money? Welcome aboard to the passenger who just join us. Those who wants to smoke, please go to the back. Don't forget to open the window. Those who want to defecate and urinate, please hold. We will have to wait for the rest area. If we keep stopping, we will never get there. There is news from the division. [sinister music[ Louder! [voice cutting in and out] - I'm going for a smoke. - You! I take you in, so you can be alive. Now you smoke excessively, you better off dead. You're my role model. You stop smoking when you have three children. You monkey! - Bro! - What? - I want to ask you something? - What do you want to ask? - Who is the Satan's minion? - I thought it was important. I'm serious. That's a story for children. What do you mean? Where did you hear that from? I'm looking for my missing friends. Some officers said they might be swallowed by the Satan's minion. Here is how the myth goes. Satan's minion was born from war. Whenever there is a war or conflict anywhere in the face of the earth, Satan's minion will be born. He looks like a human, but he has a robust body. He is ruthless. Fireball comes out of his muzzle. Those weapons used in war aren't powerful enough to defeat him. He can even swallowed an entire armored car. Are you suggesting my friends are missing because of... You figure it out yourself. If a person missing during conflict, he must be dead. They could got killed by grenades or mines, or maybe they got shot. I never thought you could left me alone and miserable. Alright then, you just look for their bodies. You see it for yourself, with your own eyes. Whose bullets on their heads belong to? Are the bullets belongs to the authority or Samerka? They might not be dead. Some people were made prisoners for months, or even years. This is actually about your will to pay them out. If your friends are willing to pay them money, case closed. If you want the story to be on the news, I can help you. There's an empty seat in the front. Nice to look at. Love. Love. Just press the on button and start talking. Which media are you with? It doesn't matter who I'm with, as long as your story is heard. Aren't you going to interview me or... Just talk. Tell the story. I'm Idrus from HiPeace, an organization which set up aid post in Sampar. [somber music] What's wrong? If it's just on the news, it's useless So? I have to investigate myself. I have to find my friends. Whether it's the authority, the devil, or even the Satan's minion. Okay. Do as you like. Amang. Look at Mr. Stick. Why? He does his prayer, but also drinks wine. I don't understand him. - Do you want some? - No, thank you. Hey, Amang! - What happened? - What's wrong? Asshole! He tried to kill us. Take a look! Asshole! You pig! If you want to die, don't take others with you, bastard! Bagudung! I'm not married yet. - Bagudung! - You bastard. I'm not married yet. Back off! He tries to kill everyone. Back off or I will hit you. Back off! Go hang yourself if you want to die! You jumped to the middle of the road. Are you trying to kill everyone on the bus? May peace be upon you. And may peace be upon you. I want to go to Sampar. I need to go to Sampar. Oh, God! What happened? Nothing. Where are you from? It's nothing. Why not take a bus from Rampak or the checkpoint? - I can't. - Who are you? Let me get on the bus. You can't. I will pay more when we arrive in Sampar. You can't. If I let you on board, other passengers will be in danger, especially with that stomach of yours. Oh, my God! You have a gun. Take me or there will be no passenger arrive in Sampar. Which one do you choose? Throw away your gun. Throw away your gun and I let you on board. Bagudung! Where did you put the first aid kit? - I put it in the back. - Go get it. What is he doing here? - Go get it! - But... - Enough. - No. Just go. Go! I paid for two seats. Sit in the back. I paid for one. You can sit here if you want. Thank you. In the name of God, the Beneficent, the Most Merciful. Yaseen. By the Qur'an, full of Wisdom, You are indeed one of the messengers, on a straight way. It is a revelation sent down by Him, the Exalted in Might, Most Merciful. In order that... Excuse me, Ma'am. May I take a look? Go ahead. Is this your son? Yes. His name is Fuad. Are you going to visit his grave? Our burden is so heavy. Your burden. What do you mean? Nothing. I'm sorry, it's dirty. Is this your granddaughter? Yes. Her name is Laila. Laila. By God's will. Laila. This is for you. I hope you will have a safe journey. Thank you. Thank you. Wear it. I will move, so Laila can sleep. [grunting] Hey! Hey! Where are you going? I want to talk to your driver. Just talk from here. - Go have a smoke in the back. - Yes, but this... I will slap you if don't listen. Go on. No funny stuff. Sit in the back. I will smash your head. You are? Zakaria. Mr. Zakaria. - Is this your family? - Yes. That's my family. You are right. I'm dangerous. I'm being sought by the authority. That morning, there was a negotiation between us and the government. General Alif himself was involved. I'm his aide. Our mandate is only one. Achieve the sovereignty of Sampar. General Alif is the most stubborn person I know. I'm not accusing him of anything. To be honest, he caused the conflict that has been going on for decades. He has died. Who killed him? I don't know. I met him during recess, he was already dying. He whispered. Stop all armed movement! Don't let our people go to war. Because there is something more important than sovereignty. What is that? Safety. General Alif said that? Soon, the whole Sampar will know that he died in the negotiation. If they know about this, they will be furious. They will seek revenge. They surely will take up arms. We are right. This mandate must be delivered to Colonel Suha. I don't want to have anything to do with Samerka. Our password is shake the world. It will be replied with for the people. Don't go to them. Don't go to the people of Sampar. Don't go to the soldiers in Sampar. They won't understand. Who will understand that General Alif wants to make peace? No one. What makes him change his mind? Why suddenly he agreed to comply with the government? Why? Because all this time, our enemy is not the government. Our enemy, Mr. Zakaria, our enemy... - Bagudung! - Yes? Take him to the back. Okay. Come on. What are you doing here? Just stay there! Stay there! Hey! Give it to me! You're wasting an expensive drink. Bagudung! What? - Checkpoint! - Okay. [frantic music] Give me all your valuables. You, your wallet! Cell phone! Hey! He has a knife. Don't do it. Help them. You're a man. - No. - Rifat. You! Hey! Sit down! Bagudung, come here! Open the window. Open it! Get ready to yell robber. Just yell and say robber! Sit down! Robber! Robber! Stop! Sit down! Everybody sit down! Sit down! Sit down! This bus is detained. All passengers get off the bus. - Search them! - Yes, Sir! Hurry up, get down! Hurry up! - Search! - Yes, Sir! He's dead. I just learned authorities can get away with misconduct. Yes. We shot dead a Samerka soldier. A robber? Follow me. Oh, no! Hey, where are you going? - Let me deal with this. - Amang! You take care of the passengers. That's your duty. Amang! What should I do? Identity Card. - Search him! - Yes, Sir! [tense droning music] He's a journalist. Yesterday, we received an order to capture this guy. Anyone recognizes him? Anyone recognizes him? Do you recognize him? A valid identity. Here. This will fit your finger perfectly. Are you trying to persuade me? Get down! Push-up! Start! Identity Card. Dien Kumala. Take it. Hey! Who asked you to take it? Idiot! Dien, take your identity card. Hey! Don't bend your knees. Take it! Too late. Where are you going? What are you doing? What are you doing? Nothing, it's just... If she didn't bend her knees, I will have a back pain. I'm sorry. Idiot! You monkey! Help him. When we found him, he was already bleeding. He told me he wanted to go to Sampar. At first, I didn't let him into the bus. Then, he pointed his gun at me. I was forced to let him on the bus. I told him that I'll let him on the bus if he throws away the gun. He threw away the gun and got in. I don't know why when he saw the checkpoint, suddenly he stood up and robbed all the passengers. Bagudung, my helper, yelled robber, and bang! I don't know who shot him. Where did he sat down? Next to me. What did he talk about? He was hijacking a bus. We didn't have time to chat. Did he brought documents? Or... If you hadn't killed him, you can asked him directly. So? I didn't see any documents. Papers or anything? I didn't see anything. Bring me his bag. Yes, Sir. - Take her! - Yes, Sir! Wait. Hurry up, go inside! - Wait. - Hurry up! This is my territory. A war zone. If one civilian died, it's common. Go on, shoot me! Oh, my God! You are supposed to realize that this is all for your own good. The separatist movement is dangerous. And whoever gives them assistance and tries to hide them. Mala! Let's go home. We'll walk if we have to. But we have to go home. What are you doing? No! Let's just find a job in Rampak. What will we do? Are we selling top-up card again? This was your crazy idea. I didn't know the situation is going to be like this. You heard it, someone got shot and died. Come on, let's go home. No! One ticket, two passengers. It's common, Sir. This lady is with her granddaughter. What is your intention traveling to Sampar? I'm visiting the graveyard. Visiting the graveyard. Whose grave? My son's. Did he die because he rebelled? What is your son's name? Sir. What is your son's name? Sir. My son and his wife were burnt alive in their home. They were burnt by his fellow soldiers. Just because he refused to take part in the war. If you want to come with me to find out his name, go ahead. Go to his grave. Pay your respects. He was burnt by his friend? I don't know which one is stupid. Your son or his friend. That is why Sampar until today is incapable of being independent. Because all of you is just a group of barbarian. - Why? - Sir. What's wrong? This lady just wants to visit the graveyard. I just want to go home and meet my family. Just like every other passengers. I guarantee that none of those passengers are dangerous. Now, I'm going to ask you. Other than this dead man, who else do you want to take? If you want, take them now! If there's no one, let us pass. We don't want to stay here too long, just to be insulted. Don't be a wise guy. You are all civilians. You don't understand anything. There are many wolves in sheep's clothing that I've killed here. He doesn't believe me. If you don't believe me, come with us to Sampar. You can see which wolves do you mean. You know what you have to do. - Yes, Sir. - Yes, Sir. Go! Hurry up! - Come on, hurry up! - Hurry up! Sir! Please help me take my bag. The red one. That's right. Yes. The other one, Sir. No need. I'm going in the bus. If you want to stay here, then stay. - Hey! - What? Keep your words. You said even in the storm, you will keep going for me. Don't say it out loud. Mala! Do what you want, Rifat. I'm just keeping our promise. If you want to stay here, go ahead. I'm going. What are you looking at? Do you have a problem? No, Sir. Sahid. Relax. We're sorry. What are those people doing in the back? They come with us to the border. What are they doing? There are so many that I don't understand from you. At first, you let that guy into the bus. Then, you asked me to yell robber. Next, the guy was shot dead. You are the one who got in trouble. I wanted to come, but you didn't let me. What is your intention? Amang! [somber music] Grandma. Yes? Who is that? I don't know. Come here. Grandma. I'm hungry. Wait for a while, we will find something to eat. This is for you. You don't have to. Thank you. - It's okay, Ma'am. - Thank you. Sir, where is the rest area? It's still far away. Just go to sleep. How can you fall asleep if you're hungry? Turn off the light. Get some rest. It's safe. Whatever. [somber singing music] Soon, we are going to arrive in the rest area. There are prayer room, place to eat, and restroom. Those who wants to eat, pray, defecate and urinate, go ahead. Sir. Is it usually this quiet? Passengers who want to pray, please follow Amang. If you want to eat, please follow me. Let's go. Eat? Where do we eat? Excuse me. What should we do? Amang! Please pay, don't just eat! Give me some more. Pay first. No problem. Just give me some more. More. Enough. In a place like this, there's a stockpile of food. Someone store them here. It must be a ghost. [geese screeching] Ma'am. I apologize, Ma'am. I thought no one is around. So, I cooked myself. Ma'am. I apologize, Ma'am. Ma'am. Praise be to God. Praise be to God. Why aren't you eating? Later. Don't be like that. There's not much time. Please eat. Please eat. That's it. Rifat. Thank you, Sir. Why do you go to Sampar? Looking for work. What kind of work? This. You read it. - You can read it yourself. - No, I'm eating. - Here. - I can't, I'm still eating. It's hard for me to read. Can you read? I'm in the process. What process? It's a job opening in Antam. Antam? That's great. Amang used to work there. He used to tell me how high his salary is in that company. - Are you serious? - Yes. Why did he left his job? I don't know. Go ask him. I already told him how stupid he is to leave his job there. But, I'm grateful he left. If he stayed there, he wouldn't stop on the side of the road and saw me inside the gutter, then he came and saved me. That's why I can meet you here. That's how. Have you heard a saying that goes you don't have to bathe, you'll be dirty anyway. You don't have to eat, you'll get hungry anyway. That's how that lady is. She doesn't want to talk to anyone. What for? The people that she talks to will be dead anyway. Have you lost someone you love? My late wife. This camera is a gift from her. She died five years ago. She died five years ago. She was shot dead before my eyes by an unknown organization. I'm sorry to hear that. Thank you. Do you still remember how you feel when you lost her? Clearly. Crystal clear. That's how the lady feels. Perhaps the feelings she endured are even worse. This is a time of conflict. Each people fight for their interest with weapons. This time of conflict is a source for those kind of feelings. Sir. What jacket is that? A non-profit organization jacket that gives aid to conflict victims. I've seen a group of people with the same jacket. Really? Where did you see them? In Rampak. Are they the ones? These people? They left two weeks ago. There is no news since. You should get off in the checkpoint outside Sampar. Maybe your group is still there. [bus radio music plays] Awesome! Damn! Awesome! Break it! - Sir. - Come on. - We have to go. - Just a moment. My son is dead, but this man looks just like him. What's your son's name? Fuad. It could be someone else. Sir... Did the robber tell you something? Yes. He told me about the beauty of Sampar in the old days. In his childhood. Before politics was involved. Before there was crossfire. Before people were fighting over natural resources. A time when you can see the children's smiles. Then, I told him about my youngest son. We have to go. [large boom] Hold on. Wait here. What is that sound? It sounded like a bomb. The east route. A conflict breaks out. We stay here until morning. Isn't it dangerous? It's better for us to stay here. Let other passengers know. We are going. We have to arrive before dusk. - Sir! - Why? You taught me when there's conflict, we must make a stop. It makes no difference now. It's different. This is guerrilla. The crossfire is more dangerous. If you want to stay here, go ahead. You too. It's up to you. - Sir! - Don't be like that, Amang! Come on, everyone get on the bus! Come on, get in! Does she wants to get paid or not? Hurry up! Come on! Susanto. That lady. She is connected to Suha. Probably his biological mother. We'll take them once we get off the bus later. If they are connected, we can make that coward come out of his nest. We can't do that. It's just a guess. We can't act recklessly. That's true. We just interrogate her now. Someone did this. What's wrong? Keep driving. Don't stop. All passengers sit down! Sit down! Samerka. Turn off the engine! All men get out! Hurry up! Go! Walk! Come on! What are you looking at? Young man. Do you know Fuad? There are many men named Fuad. Here. What is this? Where did you get this? From the soldier's checkpoint. Stay here and don't ask questions. I want to speak to your leader. This lady talks too much. Stay here and sit down! I'll shoot you head. What did I do wrong? What did I do wrong? Stand up for a moment. Stand up! Stand up! Enough. Let's go! Are you okay? Shake the world. That's the plan. Soon, we will be free. Soon. We will be free! Freedom! Samerka! [indistinct yelling] Hey! Did you see our friends in Rampak? No. No. He should have arrived. We are waiting for the news. We are seeking revenge. Was General Alif there? No. Commander. There are two intruders here. Hey! This inspection will only be a moment. We are only looking for our friend in the bus. It turns out what we found is our enemy. Be quiet! Hey! You said only two, it turned out to be three. Wait! I will explain. Shut up, you liar! This guy doesn't know anything. I will take responsibility, I'm the driver. Shut up, you liar! You said our friend is not on the bus. What's his name? Mahdi. Where is he? Mahdi is dead. He was shot in the security checkpoint. Bastard! Grandma, I'm scared. It's alright. Screw you, coward! Screw you! Where is General Alif? I don't know. Where is he? I don't know. Where is General Alif? Bastard! Enough! Stop the killing. The Sampar people is not a killer. We are not revengeful. An eye for an eye. When will it end? When they stopped, because they started it. [dog barks] Stop! Hit me back. Let them go back to the bus! Go! Let them through! Hurry up! Faster! Hurry up, walk! Come on, hurry up! Commander, where are we going now? The east route. We will help them. We will attack the authority. Let's go. [somber music] What are you doing? Just making trouble for others. The risk for being a frontline soldier. The solution. - The solution. - Sir. - What? - Every life is worth the same. Every life matters. Not really. If it weren't for me, my village won't be prosperous like today. Now in my village, there is school, health center and mosque. How can you compare my life to the mosque keeper's? The benefit is clearly different. At least, one of the authority is more useful for me, compare to you who keeps on complaining. That's why. They are dangerous. It's better when they are gone. [large boom] You sold them out. I kept thinking how did they got caught. There's nothing suspicious inside their bags. You're the one who tip them off about those soldiers. Am I right? It doesn't matter. Sooner or later, they will know. For sure. I thought only those with arms who are arrogant and have rotten minds. What's happening? Keep going. You go and hit it. Take a look. How was it? It's not the lightning, someone did that. Someone? I think it had just fallen. How about if we turn around? Impossible. The road is too narrow. Don't go. It's frightening outside. I know. Here. You don't have to come. - What happened to your hand? - Nothing serious. Let's go. Be patient. - Oh, my God! - What's happening now? - What's wrong now? - What is happening? Just start the engine. Go jump-start the bus. - Try it first. - Just jump-start the bus. Okay. We are in danger again. How could this be? Ready. Listen! [gunfire] Crossfire. [gunfire continues] From the left side. They are heading this way. Try again! Bagudung! Enough. Get in! Crossfire! Crossfire! Just hide! Everyone, get down! - Get down! - Close your eyes. Get down! Get down! Get down! Hey, you! This one first. - Hang in there. - Take a deep breath. He has a severe wound. Try it again. There's a man. Hurry, get down. Rifat. Wake up! Everyone get down! Miss, get down! Miss, get down! Look at me! Go! Ditch them outside! No! They are useless. No! - Ditch them! - Shut up! Just tied him up in the back. Fat guy, take him to the back. - Hurry! - Okay. What's going on here? Are you crazy? You put other passengers in jeopardy. You are the one who is useless. You should get off. No one is getting off this bus. - Get a rope. - Okay. Annisa. Doctor, come here! Get me a rope. Here you go. We are not there yet. Help me out here. Annisa. You have to help the person in the back. Come on. Wait. [deep rumbling] Hey! Hey, Miss! Shut up! I give you everything you want. Annisa. You let go of my father, but... You took me. Annisa, please explain. Shut up! Annisa. What should I explain? Annisa. I was raped. I was passed around. Passed around! God forgive me. I was passed around. Annisa. Annisa. You're not a killer. The gun. It's already happened. Each of his breath made me feel ashamed. Annisa! Hold tight! What is that? [indistinct yelling] Just pay them off! Give them money! Sir! I'll get down. - Let me get down. - Where are you going? I'm going down. Where are you going? It's okay. You stay here. You will get into a fight. - Let me go. - You stay here! I will do it. [chanting] Amang! Amang! Amang! Amang! Good evening all passengers. I apologize for the unpleasant performance. Actually, it's just a game It's called the first one to get off the bus died. I promise if everyone obeys, no one will have to die. Now... Is there someone named Mahdi here? Hey, you! Come here! So, you guys are friends. What should we do to him? Make it the same. What do you mean? Cut his finger and put him on fire. - We use this one? - Yes, General. Take him! You take care of it. Yes, General. Ma'am. Sweet girl, show me you ears. God forgive me. God forgive me. Do you like it? Please have your valuables ready. I forgot that they are going to burn him. I'm sorry, pretty girl. Sir. Sir. Sir, please don't take me away. I will give you money. I will make a fund transfer as soon as possible. - Hey, you! - Yes, General. Come here! Her ears. Yes, General. Use this one, General. No! How is it? I don't like transfers. I like cash. Take his belongings. Yes, General. Hand over everything! Wow. He is already dead. Pretty girl. This is what is called scared to death. Poor thing. Take him down. Burn him. Let him go! No! Take him! Hurry up. Take him out. What is this? You two are very romantic. I like seeing the two of you intimate like this. But, it's not good for business. Do you know who I am? You guys are war scums. Screw you! You better watch it! We are everywhere. We are soldiers. We are also Samerka. Have you ever wonder why every time you negotiate, it always fails? That is because we are always there. And you. You should be grateful to us. Instead of training in the barracks, you better off be in the crossfire. The Sampar people is easy to be controlled. They are stupid and hot-tempered. If they are hot-tempered, all they want is war. When they are cool, give some heat. If they want peace, just kill them. It's so easy. Hey you! Did you know? Your general is dead. Hey, you! Take the ladies out. Come on! Come on! How dare you? No! Let me go! Let me go! I said let me go! Let me go! I said let me go! Let me go! - Get up! - No, let me go! Hold it. Let go! Come on! Look at me! So, you're a tough guy? Here, hold this. Take a look and hold it. Take it! You shoot one of them. If you shoot, I'll get out. Understand? Go on. Oh, God! Get out! Don't be like that. Now, get out! I will kill them. You choose. If you choose Samerka, I will kill your girlfriend. If you choose the authority, I will kill all the other ladies. Is that clear? On the count of ten, everyone will die. One, two, three, four, five, six... Hey, man! This is not a joke. Get everyone inside! We will locked them inside. We will burn them here. Look! This lady will be the first one. The authority or Samerka? Hold on. The authority or Samerka? The authority. Damn you, authority. Take the ladies out! Yes, General! Come on! Ma'am. This is what is called magic. Go! Watch out! Go! [motorcycle buzzing] [bang] What's wrong, dear? What's wrong with her? What's wrong with her? Laila? Laila. Oh, my God! What should I do? Laila! Laila! Damn you! You are the one who supposed to be dead. What are you trying to get from a war? Conflict? Freedom? This is not how to achieve freedom. Stop blaming people! Shut up, jerk! Hey, asshole! Amang died before my eyes. Did I blame anyone? Don't lecture me. I know who is to blame. Who? You! - Who? - Enough. The world upside down. Everything is artificial. There is only war. Ants are being trampled. The lion is roaring. The fox is hungry. What will I say to your wife? The dog is stealing. Why didn't you just me let go? [singing] [music fades] [crickets chirping] [somber music] Rizky! Rizky! Rizky! Rizky! [continues shouting] Stop! Stop the bus! Open the window! Hands up! Open the window! Get them off the bus! Get them off the bus! Hands up! Open the window! We will check them all. Get all passengers off the bus! Hands up! Get everyone off the bus! We are here. [somber music] Mother? My son, his name is Fuad, not Suha. You are now the leader of Sampar. There is a message for you. Thank you. [somber music continues] [music fades]
