Hey everyone, it's me, Marnie. Welcome to "Face it". We have a special guest today. This is Torge. I'm glad you made it. Torge's going to face his biggest fear today. - Which is? - As you might guess, I dread horror movies. You must have fears too. What scares you most? Sure, I'm claustrophobic. But you guys know that already. You're not fat enough to be claustrophobic. Thank you. But I have a fear of confined spaces. I had this challenge in an elevator recently, but I passed. You're not afraid, you're strong! But I still don't dare go down into my basement. Never mind. So today's plan is we watch a horror movie, And every time you get scared you have to stand up and do a silly dance. Seriously? Wow, what's that? Shut up. Torge's dancing skills were so hilarious, it went on like that for two hours... Sorry, didn't know you were filming. That was my "thank you" video for 1000 subscribers. Thanks for always tuning in. Remember: Don't fear your fear. Face it. Best take right there. I can't do a standing ovation, but I'm coming in. Is there a rule? Is there a law? - We're here to crash it. - We're the law. We might as well spend our next 24-hour challenge in the courthouse, appointments are piling up here. - Mail! - Let's have a look, it's from the court. No worries, the boys have a guest room there. We just have to furnish it. LAST WEEK'S CHALLENGE... So we've been in here for four to five hours. Hey, folks. - What's up next? - Level Delta. Okay, give me that. I'll copy your moves, - works every time in chess. - Are you stupid? - What? - I just won. - Fuck, man. - I'd say Level Delta's yours. Dude! This is sick, this is so sick. We really doing this? I'm really doing this. - She stinks, bro. - Hurry up. Okay, let's get out of here! That smell! This way, come. - Fuck, dude! Shit! - Open the door! Now! - I thought they were always fat and slow! - You stay right there! What are you two doing here? Shit! In there! Stop! Guys. I know you! Can I get your picture? - My friends won't believe this! - Really? You really a fan? - I'm not kidding! - Okay, this is crazy, we just met a fan. - Just one picture. With both of you. - But don't rat us out, okay? - I won't. Wait, closer together. - Hey, I'll do one, too. - Now I got you! - Fuck! Shit! Well, let's see where else these kids spend a night to feel like real men during their puberty. THE CHALLENGE OF THE YEAR! As always we can't go into details, but we can give you a bit, can't we, Finn? Yeah, I hooked up with an old school buddy, and we worked on something really cool for you! This is not for wimps, wimps turn off now. We'll spend 24 hours in a real haunted house! #GHOSTHOUSE If you guys hit the shit out of that "like" button, we'll do this challenge together with our arch enemy, which is... - Betty! - Dude, what's with the voice? This buddy actually knows people who saw ghosts there, there's been paranoid activity since forever. Paranormal activity. Well, we need a penalty. If you... Go on, what do you think? I'm thinking nothing. You think Theo's taking them to the sanatorium. You think he would? Well, I think they meant Theo with "old school buddy". Hey, you'll edit me out, right? If anybody sees me on this video, I lose my part-time job and probably worse. Relax! Hey guys, this is Theo von Lützow, medicine student... Not my balls, bro, not my balls! And he's getting us illegal access... A whole night in a haunted house? I can't handle that, I'm a porcelain doll. Seriously, boys, dress warm, 'cause this will be... I'm working. So you let him send you? No, mom, you know what stubborn is? Stubborn is ignoring what your kids want! Wicked, 1000 likes in just a few seconds. You do know you can't buy lifetime with followers, right? - Keys? - In the car, dude. - Betty, you follow me, alright? - I follow too many people. Cute girls. - Your last video was so cool! - Can we take a picture? Say hi to my camera. Ladies, you're probably wondering why I agreed to this. So am I, but... I think the boys are going to get a big surprise. I prepared some stuff. Rule number one: You all have to give me something. You won't like it, but... What is this device? A thermal camera. Ghosts change the room temperature, you know? You really believe in ghosts, huh? Dude, I'm down with anything, ghosts, aliens, demons... Fuck it, we want to know, we want to find out! You want to go there, right? Am I right? What am I supposed to do? That guy's no match for you. - I know. - Get over him already. I know. Marnie, cam's still rolling. This war with Betty did well for you, huh? Yeah, it was a boost. I tell you, people love war. It just totally skyrockets your hits. Dude, can you pull over? I need to piss. Dude, it looks like you're pissing blood. Are you filming me? Fuck, dude! What's that? That's weird. I need to check something. Dude, get this! Watch, careful... Dude, did you see that? - We have a little problem. - Why? - What's up? - The lock, I don't know what it is. - You said you had a key. - Yes, for this one, but not this one. What, this lock's usually not there? No, when I come in the season to open up for tours, this one's all I need. - I don't know who put it there. - Fine, what do we do now? Fuck it, guys, I come prepared, as always! You're not serious. Here we go. - What about surveillance cameras? - It's a ruin, not a bank. - Get in the cars. - You did so not see that, girls. In we go. Get in the car. Don't you think Heilstätten sounds cooler than hospital? - Cooler? - Well, I mean, "heil" means "healing". So for the record, "heil" is a cool word from Nazi times. That was the men's station, there's the women's station, and the administration building is in the middle. Fucking spooky, and where's the ghost house, the haunted house? The surgery building is further back, we'll have to park in the woods and walk there. We're not parking this car in the woods. Isn't there some kind of driveway? That building wants to be forgotten. - Welcome! Je suis Charly. - And I'm Finn. It's another 24-hour challenge today. You said it. We're in the infamous "Heilstätten"! They've been empty since like World War V, there's supposed to be lots of ghost activity... Shut up, Betty! Let's pile it up first. I'll need a hand with the generator. Man, this thing weighs a ton. We'll unveil the mystery, we brought a ton of cameras with us, and you won't miss a thing. We also brought these flare thingies... We brought them so the loser who gives up, that would be Betty, can turn it on, so we know she gave up, she's out, and we all can go home. Emma, take this. Are you kidding me? I'm carrying enough. Just to be clear here, not even paying tourists get into this building, it's usually totally off limits. Hence the rules, the second of which is: we respect this place, is that clear? - Yes, rules, blah blah. - Betty, you follow me? On which media site? Dude, is this really necessary? Rule number three: No internet as long as we're here. What do you want? - Come on. - Wait, that was rule no. 1. You want me without phone all night? Once we leave, you can post whatever you want, this whole thing will come out anyway. We were never here, - you don't know me, got it? - Yeah, but... Absolute radio silence until tomorrow, not a soul hears about us being here. Fine. Can I at least get my car key back, please? Come on! Nice try. That brings me to our fourth and final rule: We stay inconspicuous, and we leave no trails. Dude! Paranormal activity, bro! Hey, seriously, what was that? - Take a breath. - Let's go again. - Do you always shoot like this? - Actually no. What's wrong with you? We do hard cuts. Don't you ever use hard cuts? - It's so chill. - I'll cut you hard in a minute. Let's get to the penalty. You get to decide what the loser has to eat for a whole month! - That's that. - Now we're going to take a tour. - Off we go, come on. - Who's that? What are you doing here? - You cracked the lock? - What are you doing here? - I should ask you that. - This is my thing, go home. - Aren't the tours in May? - Go home right now! - Man, this shit hits your face! - By the way, Betty's suitcase is a new "Hello Kitty" edition! It's my own edition! This jacket's new, man. I'm really getting it dirty, and just for you, folks! - We're already right in the danger zone. - It's in our fucking face. I bet there's mines and shit lying around here. - We're really taking risks here. - Shut up and check it out. Holy fuck, man! - See that, guys? Going in there tonight. - Is that it? This used to be a lung sanatorium in Nazi times. It's connected to a bath house, we can take a cool tour if you like. Lung sanatorium for tuberculosis? This is awesome! Theo, man! It is something, huh? This place kind of freaks me out. The dorks forgot to board one of the windows, see? We have to clean that up later, okay? - Watch your heads, alright? - Careful, the door. Come here, check out the light beam, you see that? Theo, you guys shouldn't be here! Zoom at this. So cool. Check this out. The light, dude. Nobody's been in here for years, maybe decades, so be cautious, stuff can come falling, you hear? It was never cleaned up. After the Russians came, it was all just abandoned. Look, how creepy. - What was this place again? - These were the patients' rooms. Alright, here we are, off we go. - Where are we heading? - Second floor. Why does this shitty base have to be on the second floor? It's next to this fucking awesome surgery room, we have to start in there. Are the stairs safe? Hitler was a patient here once. You mean like "the" Hitler? They say he was hit by a grenade during WW1, treated here, and then he set up a memorial room here somewhere. Hey Finn, I got an idea. Here, get the cam. You're such a jerk! Comrades, you must protect the Aryan race! From the mutants! Abort their children, their children's children, their dogs and cats! - What are you doing here? - Just fun, bro, just fun. - And what is that? - Nothing. You can't do that! What did I say? You can't treat history like that, and you can't just enter rooms without asking me! - So now you're playing cameraman? - Yeah, man. - Hey dude, what's with you and Betty? - What do you mean? Come on, man, I can see it. Finn? You little wanker... I just don't get it. You and Finn? Isn't it obvious? It's publicity! It'll boost bookings and get people interested in this place. Did you tell them this place is cursed? Marnie, what the hell? You get on a train, come out here and... Dammit, Theo, I saw that woman! I felt her hate! And still here you are. Help me get it. I hate this place! I'm afraid of this building! So, we're touring the location to see what goes down here or not... - Lots of people killed themselves here. - What? Homeless people regularly jump out of the windows or hang themselves here, a photographer killed his model somewhere in here, - And there's the Beast of Beelitz. - What's that? A serial killer. - You google too much, Emma. - Guys, where's Theo? You're here because you know who I'm here with. Otherwise you'd never have dragged your sweet ass out here in a million years. You want the others to boost your channel. Yes, I remember what happened! I'll never forget the accident and your panic attack. They left quite an impression. - Dude, she saw something here! - No shit? No shit! We can't let her leave, imagine... ...she's our medium and can talk to ghosts! That's hot shit! We have to throw her a bone so she stays here. We'll reel her in, bro! Listen, we have a cool idea. How would you like to star in our video? As a medium? Better yet, you tell us everything and we link you up! Yeah, we link our channel to yours! Crass. First... paranormal activity... You know what? Maybe this is a chance to find peace. What do you mean? Well, you lie to those three followers you have, every day! Your biggest issue isn't claustrophobia. I am claustrophobic! You know what that feels like? Yes, right, but how about here and today... ...you face your real paranoia! Your fear of the hallucination you had back then. Whatever it was. And maybe you'll see that there's nothing to fear. Think about it. Let's get started. Marnie... Are we in grave danger here? Say yes! Yes! Should I... like interview-style? This is spooky. Is all this shit from back then? Yes, many crimes against humanity took place here. Like what? Uncurable tuberculosis patients were given "mercy death", for instance. They were called "unworthy life". Pretty interesting, actually. I brought some college stuff about it, you might want to put it in the mov... Have to keep an eye on every spooky corner, we have enough cameras for that. Don't fall out the window. - We'll do this. - That's right. What's this? - Here. - Hey, you shouldn't do that. Chill. I got good insurance. What is this anyway? A spittoon. Tuberculosis patients used to carry them around their necks. So here comes Phase Alpha, first contact attempt with the ghosts. With the dark side. - Put your fingers on it. - Do we close our eyes? Sure. But no cheating, guys. Yo, hereafter to thereafter, anybody online? I don't think you say it like that. What, do I recite a poem? Wait, I have one in mind. Who rideth so late in night and wind... It beith the glass with the little fingers... Is anybody else besides us six here in this room? Ghost, dude, you there? Ghosty, will this video be a hit? Guys? What was that? - I think it was just a breeze. - Well, then go check if you're so sure. Marnie, did you see anything? Anything? You guys are such wimps, man. Watch this. I'll put this on it. Bang. There we go. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing at all. Nothing. Definitely just the wind, guys. No signs or trails of any "ghost cold" or whatever. Finn, it's winter. Everything's cold. Charly, what's it like to work on camera? Help us out, man! - Why does this have to go downstairs? - It's annoyingly loud. - Don't they also come in silent? - They also come in blue. You got one? Dude! Where do these tunnels lead, Theo? The whole facility is connected underground. - Charly, watch it! - Dude! - Holy fucking shit, man! - Yes, that way leads down. Why don't you secure this shit? I'll write that down. Hey my dears, it's me, Marnie. Today, hold on to your butts, we have Prankstaz and Bettyful We're here in the old sanatorium. Why? Well, today I will be facing my own biggest fear. And I wasn't... Well... The elevator, that wasn't really my... Shit. Why are we in Heilstätten? I was here last year with my sister and boyfr... Ex-boyfriend. Theo... Man. Theo? - Where was that room again? - Should be that door to the left. - I remember giving it to Emma or Charly. - Maybe it fell down, I don't know. I bet the fucker hid it somewhere. Bullshit. But hey, the room has to stay sterile, so no smoking in here. Sorry. - It's okay. - Hang on. Found it. - Really? - Yep. Thanks. You heard what Theo said earlier? About tuberculosis being sexually stimulating? Why? Not sure, I guess because of body heat or... Maybe because they wanted to feel close to somebody one last time or so. Is that still running? Yeah, should I turn it off? - Shit! - Pranked! Fuck you, Chris! Fuck you! What are you, five years old? - That was so good, man! - Are you fucking nuts? - This is going viral. - You asshole. When we upload this one, you're going to be so... Hey! Who are you? - Bro, this is a homie, it's okay. - It was funny, wasn't it? So fucking sweet. - Is this a spoof on the Beast of Beelitz? - Yeah. Who? I'm risking everything! And you just invite people in here! What was rule number 4? Inconspicuous! - Okay, I'm leaving. - Yeah, you go. Dude. Fucking awesome. I'm out. Hey, it wasn't that bad, was it? Come on. - What is this shit you guys are doing? - What do you mean? Finn, do you seriously want to earn a living like this? He won't post... That's why you gave up what we used to have? He won't post it too early. Dude, he's alright, what are you talking about? You set all this up! Do you know what the Beast of Beelitz did? The guy took a woman's baby and smacked it against a tree! Then he strangled her and raped her dead body! When her husband, a chief doctor, heard that, he hanged himself! - And you're joking about it! - Dude, what's wrong with you? Are you like envious of Charly or me or our success? - I feel big negative vibes in here! - What we had back then... It was given thought... and heart. Yeah, but nobody watched it! Finn. Because of guys like you, and that stuff you do all day... our youth is going stupid. Yo, what's up, splashers, it's me again, Chris! The plan was a total success, Betty wet the shit out of her pants. I can tell you that. They're the gods of bad jokes. And to be honest... This place alone... is a shitty joke. Okay, I guess I got lost. Where the hell is this fucking gate, guys? Can't find it. If there is anybody here, I got something to tell you, alright? If you kill me I won't survive it! Shit, I really am lost. Some sick shit. - We're nice and cozy here. - Say chee... Oh, fuck, he's missing... his mouth. It's cold. It's creepy. You got that? The beds are not the most comfortable, but... we're not going to sleep anyway. We'll go hunt ghosts for you. Can I ask you something? What was it like to see a ghost? Medium, how was your first ghost encounter? Well... It was... more like... something psychotic in my head. Shitty houses, shitty place, I came out here on my own free will. Okay, I'm about to meet some familiar faces here... Okay, cool sound system, guys. Now I'm getting pranked, too. Hello? Dude, what are you doing? We need to swap the SD chips, these babies have been running a while. I've been lying to myself all this time. I don't know why I still have... feelings for Theo. I don't even know why I'm telling you all this. Smart. Well... Honestly, I don't know which I'd prefer. That I'm actually crazy, or... ...that I'm right. I just know I have to find out. I just don't know how I can or should... No idea. But I thought of something. I'm scared the whole time here, and it sucks. So, to fight my fears, with a little craziness... every time I get scared I'll say "yeah, Baby". I know it... sounds stupid, but it's... Shit. Hey! Let there be light! Not right in my face, man. - You guys okay? - Why shouldn't we be? Where's Betty? What's wrong, Marnie? I'm not sure, I just... What's up? You guys fucking serious? Quit your shitty pranks, guys, that's so gross! Those are moths. Fuck, dude, that was a good prank! Sweet! Dude, that wasn't me. Dude, it was Betty! Some cheap attempt of revenge. Betty? She'd freak out seeing a little moth. "Ew, moth!" Betty's a little moth herself! That brings me back to my questionwhere Bett - Does she have her cell on her? - He took them all. Are you guys kidding? - What's that? - What the hell, who did that? - Were those in your pocket? - Yes! Where's my phone? Wait. Betty didn't tell you where she went? Move! Come! - Betty! - Betty, come out wherever you are! Dude, think. If something happened to her, you want to get it on tape. Are you for real? - Hello? - Betty, say something! She's not here, let's move on. Betty! Come on! So, we'll go through the building and look around. Maybe... Turn off the camera. It's a wrap for now, this is not funny anymore. - Dude, chill out, man. - Betty! - Maybe she lit her torch. - Will we find her? We'll see. Dude, turn that off! So we have our first missing person, and it's Betty! What a surprise! Will we find her... Turn off the fucking camera or I'll knock it out of your hand! Not funny anymore! You're filming the whole time, that's the point! Yeah, but this isn't fun anymore! Well, it's all supposed to be fun, isn't it? I bet she's squatting behind a bush or something. We're heading down here. What are your thoughts on Betty missing? You think she conked out? - Betty, where are you? - Betty! Okay. Thanks for this interview, Marnie. - Didn't Betty have her... - Fuck, did you hear that? What? - Just kidding. - Fuck you, man, okay? Ladies, I'm sorry I was off the radar for so long. A lot happened here, and I learned one thing for sure: People can be way worse than some creepy place. Okay, my orientation isn't the best here, but... Looking good, I think... Yes. This is the room I wanted to show you. By the way, this whole experience can be summed up under #needsgettingusedto... But it's nice once in a while to be without cell phone, without internet, and to simply... Shit! Shit! Marnie, right? First things first. You came in all crazy and upset. Why? Yeah. Right. What was that about? Don't know. I just had this strange feeling. But you don't have any strange feelings now, do you? - What? What do you guys think I am? - I don't know. - Which one of you did that? - Where were you? - Which asshole did that? - What the hell? - Who did that thing with the tub? - What happened? - I filmed a woman, covered in blood. - A woman? - You're recording this, too? - Of course I am. Theo, I was right. Bathtub? You mean in the women's bath house? We won't let anyone terrorize us, we're going there! Yes, we're going! - What? - Come! Alright, looks like we got us our first paranormal sighting. We need to check out what it is. Why didn't any of you geniuses bring flashlights to this? Because you genius locked them in Finn's glove box. Right, I forgot how much your cell phones are responsible for these days. - Betty, you're sure it was here? - Of course I'm sure. Would you please have a look? You should look for yourself. - No way, I just want to get out of here. - Wait, stop. Does that mean you give up? Do you give up? Then we have two winners, bro. You're a sick asshole, fuck your stupid challenge! - We didn't do this. - Yeah, right. Nobody did anything, there's nothing here. Look at the tub, it's empty. Come. Shit, that's impossible! The whole tub was full of blood, I filmed the woman, I saw her in my displ... I can show you... Where's my camera? I lost my camera here somewhere! Betty, did you just see her, or are you sure you also filmed her? Please say you filmed her. Both! I filmed it, I saw it on my display! - No camera here, where did you drop it? - I don't know, somewhere here! Here's nothing. Man, I'm not crazy, maybe somebody cleaned up the blood. - A whole tub? - Time-wise that's not possible. Betty... What did the woman look like? Like a woman covered in blood. What did her eyes look like? Was she wearing a white patient's gown? - There was blood everywhere! - Finn, you got your black light on you? - Sure. - Can you please stop filming? - Here. - Thanks. - Turn that light off. - Where is that camera? Blood contains proteins. If there was as much as a drop in here before, I should still find traces of it. Have you ever examined hotel beds? - Guys, I'm not crazy, really. - You've been saying that a lot. - What? - You're saying you're not crazy a lot. Shut the fuck up, you wannabe! You shut up, what's with the wannabe talk? - I know what I saw! - There's nothing here! Shut your fucking mouth! There's nothing here! You stupid fame bitch! - Hey, guys! - I know what I saw! - Enough with all this! - Chill! Charly, turn your light off, please. - Oh, shit. - What's that? Is that blood? What happened here? It looks like a mass slaughter! Hey, guys... That's old German, can somebody translate? That's Sütterlin script. "Nobody... heals... the... moths. Nobody... helps... me. So... shall nobody... who un... unfil... unhelpingly... enters the site..." - What is that supposed to mean? - Is Heilstätten the site? No, they don't mean the sanatorium. That's the curse! - I told you the whole time! - What curse? - We shouldn't have come here! - It can't be! There's no such thing as... - I told you! - There are no curses or... ghosts! I told you they exist! The woman I saw... The woman Betty saw... Maybe she was Patient 106? - Why didn't we think of that earlier? - Maybe we should leave. "Moths" used to be colloquial for tuberculosis because it eats away the lungs like... moths. I need to use my phone! My siblings don't know where I am... - Forget phone calls, we pack, we leave. - I told you this was a shitty idea! "Nobody who unhelpingly enters the site..." What's going on now? What's up? What's up? - Wait, the generator... - Theo, I told you! What now? What do we do now? Theo, do you see that? The power's off, the projector shouldn't be... - What is this sick shit? - What's happening here? - Theo, did you bring this shit? - No. What? Don't fuck with me, those are some sick educational videos of yours! No, that's not from me! Pay no attention to it... No! - That's her! That's the woman I saw! - What? - That's Patient 106! - What? Theo, look at her wrists! Leave me! Don't you want to tell the people you brought here what's going on? Looks like he didn't tell you about this woman here, did he? Theo? There was this woman patient. And she had an affair with one of the doctors. She got pregnant, but her condition worsened. How you know all this, man? From files that were recovered later. For certain reasons, the whole case was... hushed up. And what happened to the woman? She slit her wrists in the women's bath house and cursed this place. The site is the surgery room. That's where she was killed. The photographer, the homeless man, the Beast of Beelitz, They all set foot in that surgery room, didn't they? We don't know that for sure about each... So this woman's ghost makes people kill themselves and others? Couldn't you have given us that information before we planned all this shit here? You would know that yourself if you'd look past Wikipedia for once! You brought us here! You should told us! Hey! Guys! Okay, maybe... she wants something from us. Maybe, I don't know, she wants to tell us something or she wants our help. Yeah, right, she wants help. It's been a blast with you all, who puts the light on so I can leave? - But wait... - Fuck it! What? What? What a shit idea. "Nobody who unhelpingly enters the site..." - The sentence goes on. - Fuck it, man! Theo, get the lights back on in here! - Give me my car keys! - How will you do this? We'll drive through the bushes, you pack up, we'll come get you and then we get the hell out of here. Give me my keys, man! - Leave it on, bro. - Yeah, man. I'll go check the generator. Charly, you coming with me? No, you do that alone. Okay, be right back. What are you doing with that stupid guy? Watch your step, okay? That stupid moron. If this light goes out, we're so fucked! We're so fucked. That way! Careful. This is a dead end. Wait, you hold the camera, point the light ahead, I'll lead. Don't let the light go out, we need it. Come on. Watch out. I can't see. Point the light here. Stay behind me. - Where are the fucking cars? - Stay with me. They must be here somewhere. Come on! - Finn? - Yeah? - My car won't start. - What? - The car won't start! - Fuck! Shit, then get in mine! Get in! - Mine's dead, too. - What? Nothing! Zero! Point the light down there, point it below the wheel! The fuses are fine. What the hell is this? Somebody's fucking us! This is impossible. Fuck, the phones are gone! I know terrible things happened to you. And I understand that you're angry. Is there a way to help you? Any way? Please tell me something. Give me a sign, anything. Speak to me. Crap. - Come on, Finn, let's just leave! - What? No, we're not leaving them behind! We need to try to find help somewhere! What's this now? What the hell? This wasn't like that! - Where's the lock? - That can't be! - There's got to be an end here! - Finn, let's go back and get your bolt cutter! Fuck, come on! Come the fuck on! Finn, dammit! That's pointless! Stop it! You hear that? What is that? Don't know. Is that a phone? - Where, where is it coming from? - From that way. Come! Come on! Come! We have to find it before it stops ringing! Come! Come! - Shit! - We have to go in and look, come! Hurry, hurry! It must be here somewhere! Chris! Get out! That's Chris! Out! Fuck! Fuck, what's happening? Shit! No! Shit, no! No! Wait, I got the flare! We don't have much time! Come! Come! - I can't go so fast! - Stay close! This way! This way! - I can't go so fast! - This way! In here! Where the hell are they? Looks like we have a winner. Come on! Hey! Where are you? Run, run! - Shit! - Stay with me! Stay close to me! - Finn, what do we do? What do we do now? - Stay calm. Stay close! Stay close to me! - What do we do? What do we do? - Stay calm, breathe... Stay close! I'm here! - Do you have the second flare? - What? Give it to me. Give me the flare. Where are you? Calm down, stay calm. It's going to be fine. Who was that? Upstairs! Come on! Stay behind me! Betty, come! Where are you? Come! Dude, are you nuts? Why did you light your flare? - Chris is dead! He's lying back there. - What? Chris, is that the guy from earlier? - What's the matter? - Chris is dead, - he must have fallen or been pushed... - Where did you find him? His phone was ringing, there was a light... Did you call the cops? Our phones are gone and our cars are dead! Why are you talking crap? Dude, man, we're totally fucked! - Did you take his phone? - What? His phone, did you take it? We need it. And the chain at the gate, it has no beginning or end. Theo had your keys! That means he must have the phones! How? He was here the whole time! Then where the hell is he now? He went down to the generator, I thought you'd come back together. - So he's still down in the basement? - I don't know where he is! Okay, get your asses downstairs to the entrance! I'll go get Theo! What? No! - Fuck Theo, he got us into this! - He was my best friend! Typical horror film scenario, will the group split up or... He was my best friend until you showed up! I got you away from that nerd, I turned you into a fucking brand! - Dude, he lost his family! - Calm down! - I won't let him down again! - Give me the fucking camera! - Give me your flare! - Give me my camera! - Give me your flare! - Hey, Finn! - Once a traitor, always a traitor. - Fuck you, piece of shit! - Where are you going now? - Doing the right thing. Finding Theo. The right... What... No! Please, you can't just go now... Please... - Yes, we can! - I'm going with you. How long has he been down there? Finn, we can't go in the basement. We're not leaving anyone behind tonight, okay? Come with me, please. We go over there and get Chris' phone. Finn said it was ringing, so we have a signal out here, we can call the police. What the fuck is wrong with you, we can't just call the police! Charly, we need to call the police if there's a dead body out there. Right. We... who, as I almost forgot, are illegally trespassing on this property. Great idea, Emma! Who cares? If there's a dead body, we have to... Hey guys, guys, keep calm. It doesn't matter... who we call! We still need that phone! It's freezing, we're in the middle of nowhere, we need help, we need to get that phone! Where's the fucking camcorder? Why do you need a camcorder? I'll go to Chris and get his fucking phone. And take a look at what happened. Besides, you seem to forget that we're still making a movie! And guess what, Emma, you were in it! That should get you the attention you desire so much. Fuck, you can't see a thing out here! What do we do now? She wants us to stay here. Fucking movie, fucking kindergarten freakshow... Where are we? No. I have to do everything myself. - Come on, come with me. - Please let's not go in there. - We need to find him. - We can't go into the basement. Come on. Stay with me. Careful. Stay behind me. There's a hole, be careful. Shit, I can't see anything. Stay behind me. Stay behind me. Fucking bitches, always nagging. We're here to shoot a fucking movie... Where's your... Where's your phone, man? Where's this fucking phone? Shit. Where's the fucking phone? Hello? Dude, please cut it out, that's not... Fuck, what did I get myself into here? Okay. Stay calm. You know what it said in her file? She was declared worthless. She was just made silent! Of course she wants people to know about her now! Look, the gate's locked. And nothing's working except the cameras. And I bet the perimeter fence is still charged. Why? She wants us to finish this film! Emma, she suffered so bad, I can feel it! - Let's just get out of here! - No! We can't leave him behind. Hello? Come. I'm with you, I'm with you. Finn, can we please not go along here? We need to find him. Are you somewhere here? - Shit! - What? What? You see that? What is it? You see that? What is that? Something's standing there! This... This is not funny anymore. - Stay to my right, to my right! - Can we please leave? - Please let's turn around! - Betty! Come! We have to get him! - Let's just go! - We need to find him! Who are you? Say something! It's Theo! - Shit... - Why are you standing in the dark? - What? - She's... She's... - I don't understand. - What's wrong? She's standing right behind me! What? She's standing right behind me! Theo, please stop this shit, you're scaring me. Sounds kind of shitty, but in a way I'm happy we found something. What do you mean? Thanks. Well... Theo smuggled me and my sister in here last summer. I... freaked out. My sister tried to calm me down, but... She fell. We carried her out. Theo's not allowed to let anyone in here. Everybody said I'd gone mad. The whole time. And now we found something. That's just... wow. Betty, are you okay? - I think I sprained my ankle! - Can you get up? Can you stand, can you jump? Can you jump up, can you do that? - No! - You see anything you can hang onto? - Anything? - No! Please help me! Okay, look, you need to stand up! You need to grab this! I can't reach it, it's not working! Shit! Fuck! I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Shit! Shit, don't panic. I'll get you out. I'll get you out of there somehow! I need to find something to pull you out with, maybe a ladder, or a chain or something! You got a light? Does that camera have light? You got light down there? No, this thing only makes colors. I need to look for something to get you out with! If anything happens, scream! Light the flare, and I'll come right back! You hear me? - Please don't go, I don't want to die! - Trust me! I'll be right back, okay? - Two younger sisters. - Cute. One of them even sees me as a role model. Something's happened! You hear that? Hear what? - Grab your stuff, we'll go! - What's wrong? You're right, she wants to hurt us! Oh, fuck, no, man! Just any rope! Come on! Is there nothing here? Was that you, man? Shit. Is that... Fuck, yeah! Theo, man! Shit, man! Dude! Dude! What the... ESCAPE "Escape"? "Nobody shall escape." She wants... me to die. Daddy... I'm so sorry we had that fight. I just wanted you to be proud of me. You're not a loser. I just said that because I was so mad at you. I just wanted you to know. I think it's really important to try out new things in life, and this challenge is something new for me. I was here, I was here before! Wasn't I? These fucking rooms all look the same! What is that fucking sound? Where am I? I have to collect all the SD cards. I need to start going through the footage. I want to get out of here! I'm going to get home, everything's fine! Tomorrow you're back home. Breathe. It's all good. What is that fucking sound? Hello? - We need to leave the building now. - What happened? - Betty? - Come. Come. - Which one was the exit? - The door in the middle. What is this? No. Stop! Emma! She doesn't kill those who want to help her! Emma! Fuck it, man! I don't want to help her! I just want to get out of here! Calm down, will you? No! This isn't helping! We have to stay calm, okay? Take a breath. I'm with you in this, and we'll figure out a solution. It's all going to be fine. You're bleeding. Emma, wait, where are you going? - I'm jumping! - Don't! - You need to calm down! - Let me go! Betty, where are you? Where's this fucking hole? What... What was that? Fuck, man, fuck! Okay, moving on... Betty? Say something! Shit. Shit, shit! Come on, no! Stay on! Fuck, man! Betty, I'm coming! I'm coming! We expect a lot of ghosts there, and we assume that we won't survive the night. But we'll be bringing others to their deaths, too. Write comments, share this video... - Oh, no! - Please help me. Do not move a muscle! I'm coming down now, but don't move! Holy shit! The cable, watch the cable, okay? Stay calm! Emma? I'm coming! Shit! Emma? Oh, no! No, no! You win. Where am I supposed to go? What do you want from me? Why are you doing all this? What do you want to show me? No! No! Oh, God! Oh, dear! Shit! This isn't funny! Vanessa. Come on. Oh, God! It's time. My medical exam starts now. Remember? Rule number 1: You'll all have to give me something. You won't like it, but... You didn't seriously think I meant your cell phones? One is missing. Get Marnie. Actually, it couldn't have gone any better. Marnie shows up here, surprises me, and reveals herself to be a lying fame bitch. And then... a fourth gurney becomes free for her because she accidentally throws someone down the stairs again! This, dear community, is my ultimate prank on your kings of prank. What a shame they didn't spring all the traps that the rooms of my modest kingdom had in store for them. I must mention that a lot of planning went into this and... anonymous help from the dark. From me to you now, a little montage. I left out the sabotaging of cars, generators and any other technology, that's rather unspectacular. And yes, I exploited the horrible history and the legends about Patient 106. Certainly impious, but with a noble goal... Your attention. The apple, dear followers and likers, is the Biblical symbol for the fruit of knowledge. And today, the bitten apple is depicted on the backs of your cell phones. What a cynical symbol. Although these devices practically mean cultivation. Within seconds you can find an answer to any question, but... Do you cultivate yourselves? No. Once, there used to be encounters, real encounters. Once, kids knew Goethe's Faust by heart. And today they don't even know how to spell Goethe anymore. Action! Bad-ass videos! That's what it's all about! About bad-ass videos! Today, I have such a bad-ass video for you. After long preparation, I am happy to finally finish it. Who do we start with? Betty! You, who carry your nose so high, and always say that true beauty comes from within! Guys, true beauty comes from within. We'll see about that. Charly talks so much crap, I'll hang him by his vocal chords. It's going to be messy, I can tell you that. We'll save you for later, you can look forward to it. And Finn. Yes, Finn. I'm not so sure about you. You'll have to decide. You know, sometimes I miss those times when I used to write your text on cards and hold them up behind the camera. We had so much fun because... the experiments always failed at first. But still we had precious times. And then came Charly. Charly, I was never envious of Charly. I do not envy, I was jealous! And that's something else. A friend, or brother, as you called me, or he did, and the prospect of millions of followers! You made your decision. And then you actually responded when I offered you to do a challenge here. You saw a benefit for yourself, and so... You... you took the bait. So now, dear Finn, you get to decide again. What do you want to say goodbye to? Your brain? Or your heart? Tell me. Heart. Yes! I thought so! Diacetylmorphine. Heroin. Theo, Marnie's gone! - Marnie's gone? - She's not in the hole anymore! That's impossible, nobody gets out of that hole! I'll get my four patients! - Shall I go on cutting? - We're still missing cameras. I didn't mean the film. Marnie, I need to talk to you. Marnie, you can't do that! Stop! You lied to me all along, you psychopath! Stop running! You say I'm a liar? You're just here to stick your face in these cockroaches' channels! So who's the liar here? Where are you? - I came here because I still love you! - Stop! Stop running. - Marnie, you can't escape! - Leave me alone! You forgot to board a window, asshole! I didn't forget that window! Very good. I'm going to scoop you up now. No. You clever... bitch! She's gone! Why did you leave that window open? It was a trap! Man, you know that, she would never have escaped me! She... She just... She just pranked us! Great edit, Irina, it sure works. And it's already got the torture room finale! Sound design's a bit over the top, but it's great. Then you send it to these cell phones, What's with these blanks in between after this guy Chris showed up? Oh, right, I didn't put in everything yet. Still stuff missing? Hey, did you check if he posted anything, if he uploaded anything? If he'd posted anything we'd already be hip-deep in fangirls by now. So, come on now, final scene. - Hey, we could... - Theo, we stick to the plan. I have to edit it in. Come. Okay. Marnie... Congratulations, you made it. You got away. And if you're watching this I'm sure you've already gone viral, and are getting all that attention. And you, dear fans? Did you have fun? Did you get enough blood? Or too little? Now, it's just me left. What do you feel now? You want to see me bleed? Because this video is for you, and you should get what you want. So... The feeling remains... that something remains. Yo, what's up, splashers, it's me again, Chris! I think I got the name... I'm lost, where the hell is... Oh, God! God! Oh, God, no! Oh, God, help! Help! Thanks for always tuning in. Remember: Don't fear your fear. Face it. I think it will be good for me and my channel to try out something I've never done before. There's really evil souls on the loose there. Will we survive the night? I don't think so. We'll leave a dope video for you!
