ROBIN BERGSTROM (ON TV): Run off in the designated area which had been exposed to acid rain began to recover its normal chemistry after it was shielded from further pollution. Well, everyone is anxiously waiting to see if winter is finally behind us. Or if the mild weather of the last two days is just a tease. And who better to tell us than our own eager beaver weatherman, Art Baxter. Rev it up, Art. ART BAXTER (ON TV): Well you talk about a pleasant surprise, Robin. The current mid-town temperature is 74 degrees and not a cloud in the sky. Now let's take a look at our satellite photograph. As you can see, right up from the Rockies we are tracking this warm flow of air over the lower Mississippi River valley, up to the Northeast. So basically, what I'm trying to say weather mavens, is make sure you bring a light coat or jacket. Now, let's take a look at some temperatures in our viewing area. Patty Preston, checking in at Lake Carmel, 71 degrees and bright sunshine. Linda Silio of Patterson, New Jersey, sunshine and 73. And Tom Court, our weather watcher from Huntington, says 77 degrees under partly cloudy skies. By the way, thanks to all our weather watching, take time and energy to give Art a call. And Patty, Linda, and Tom, your exclusive Baxter weather rock is on the way. Now looking at our extended forecast right here, today continues sunny, 73 to 77. Sunday, cloudy, 52 to 55. Currently, 74 degrees, bright sunshine in Central Park. And that doesn't it for me, this is Art Baxter. And Robin, I am out of here. ROBIN BERGSTROM (ON TV): Thanks Art. Tomorrow is Greek Easter and Marva Webber was in the story of Queens for last nights Epitaphion procession. MARVA WEBBER (ON TV): It seemed as if New York's entire Greek community was at the Saint Demetrios Church, in Astoria. And though the 11:00 PM Good Friday service was colorful enough, the real pageantry began at its conclusion. [coughing] MARVA WEBBER (ON TV): --the entire congregation followed it's progress as it was carried outside the church and onto the street. Police were on hand to re-route traffic, allowing the massive procession to move unimpeded on its six block journey. After a tour of the surrounding area the tomb was returned to the alter, ready for tomorrow nights resurrection service. This is Marva Webber, WYOC, from Astoria, Queens. ROBIN BERGSTROM (ON TV): The holiday will reach its peak tonight when, precisely at midnight, the Priest emerges with the Communal Candle, representing the spirit of Christ. Well, that's it for this mornings report. For a complete wrap up of the days events, join Richard Sanders and Judy Morrison on the 11 o'clock news. Stay tuned Reynold Wrap's, "Cartoon Cavalcade." Until next time, I'm Robin Bergstrom, have a happy Saturday. NEWS MAN (ON TV): Be sure to tune in after tonight's 11 o'clock news for our late night double feature. "Sherlock Holmes and the Hands of Othello," starring Nigel Winters and William Deel. And "Cycles," a rectangular love story featuring Anita Finlay and-- CORINNE (IN HIS HEAD): You know Bill, I think it's great that you and Pete were roommates. [laughter] No, no more. Oh, before I forget, here's a little something from me to you to commemorate our change of address. What's this? PETER: Well go ahead, open it. Oh, Peter. Thanks. Well Bill, since you refuse to quit that disgusting habit of yours, at least now you can keep it under control. This is nice, but can I really stomp out my butts in this? PETER: Get used to it, this is our apartment now. We're going to keep it neat. Right? Right. Can you believe this day? Hot enough for you? Don't bother, I'll just have a corned beef sandwich and a glass of milk. Gus, would you try cut the fat off? I, I don't like corned beef when it's too fatty. Huh. These are the best eggs in New York City. Prices are better than the auto-mat. When you consider that it's right around the corner, you can't beat it. Peter. You know, I really like a beer with my corn beef. But I made a deal with the doctor. Gotta cut down on the salt, bad for the pressure. Yeah, I sure would like that beer. You know I don't believe that. I, I just-- I need to sort myself out, find myself. Hello, Peter. BILL: So long, Gus. [laughter] [merry chatter] PATTY: All right, OK, I give up. I'm sorry. BILL: It's nice here. PATTY: Isn't it great? BILL: God, it is. PATTY: I remember when we first came here. BILL: You do? PATTY: Oh god, yes. BILL: You remember? PATTY: Is was sort of cloudy out. BILL: Uh-huh, uh-huh. PATTY: You never remember anything honey, You know that? BILL: I remember. Did you have enough to eat, honey? Yeah, I did. Bill? Hmm? Bill, why did you insist on going to Boston University? What? Well I mean, it seems so far away. You could have gone to state. Well Patty, I, I really like the program. I love working in the theatre. You have no idea how it-- besides, you gave me a chance to see the ocean. But you already saw it in the army. That was the Pacific, this is the Atlantic. And besides, I really like Boston. Well, next summer you'll be back to stay. I suppose every man needs to sow some wild oats before settling down. ELMER: Yo Frayne, hey, how hell are you? Elmer, what brings you down to this neck of the woods? Well, I had a little business meeting in the area so I-- On a Saturday? Well, when you get older you got to go the extra mile to keep pace. I'll be honest with you Bill, things haven't the same since my business went under. You heard about that I suppose. No. Oh. I'm retired for three years now, doctor's orders. I see, well I had a little run of bad luck but I, I'm picking myself up. I have to go slow thought, don't have much capital. Gotta keep plugging, never know what's around the bend. Listen Bill, can you wait just a minute? I want to check the old balance. Sure Ha, just as I expected. Boy, you really got to watch these people. They've been holding onto a California check of mine for two weeks now. I wouldn't mind but, you know, I'm just getting started again, cash flow you understand? Sure Elmer, what happened down in LA? The last I heard you were raking it in. Well after I left the agency, what year was that? '69 I think. Yeah, right, well as you know, I'd gone about as far as I put there but this a-- my position was still very precarious. I was being created, I had my ass too far out on a line. No, I should've done what you did. Find a nice secure position, let everyone else to the in fighting. You made more money, got all the recognition. Yeah but that was, that was short term, I was still too vulnerable, too exposed. I mean, one client gets his nose out of joint about something, anything, I was gone. You seemed to manage pretty well. Yeah, did all right didn't I? Well, my job was so tenuous anyway I figured, why not be my own boss? I mean, what that hell, roll those old dice. So you started your own agency. Yep, once you start working for yourself, I tell you Bill, you wonder why you ever did anything else. I guess that's one way to avoid kissing ass. Yeah, right, so the recession hit and the market bottomed out. 'Course, I was overextended, I mean who the hell ever expected those boom times to end? So I took a Chapter 7 on the business. It was really touch and go. But I, I thought I could make it through but then, right then, Corra and I split up for good. I'm sorry. I tell ya Bill, we've been having trouble for a long time, way back as far as New York. But when she left me I guess I just sort of fell apart. I mean when, when you're so close to someone for so long, you know-- Sure, I understand. You're a good friend, Bill, always have been. No I, I appreciate that, really. But that's all, that's all done now, and things are really looking up. Well Bill, uh, I gotta get the old rear end moving, no rest for the wicked you know. Well, it was great talking with you, Elmer. I, I don't see too many people nowadays. But uh, you're all right uh, you're well taken care of? Oh sure, I got a nice profit sharing check when I retired. Oh good. Listen, Bill, let, let me give you my card. Never know when something might turn up. Here, let me fix that for you, telephone numbers no good. You can always reach me [inaudible] my sister. God bless her, you want to get in touch. Well, so long, Bill. Nice seeing you, Elmer. Good luck. Come on. Coming? [coughing] You uh, you don't understand, I need it very badly. Look Jonathan, I'm tired of lending you money. What do you think I am, rich or something? When are you going to start paying me back? Goddammit, I need the money now. Well I don't have it. Don't lie to me. I'm telling you I don't have it. I don't get paid till next Friday and all I've got from last weekend's binge is 7 bucks. Well give it to me then. No. Give it to me now. No. Give me the money. Hey I ain't got time for this, give it to me now. No. What do you want from me? I don't understand. I don't feel connected to your life, not at all. I mean, you lie to your mother about me. The people at the agency don't even know I exist. What am I, Bill, just something warm to lay next to at night? I'm sorry, I wish I could-- you're asking too much. I need to know where I'm going, Bill. Being your gigolo, no matter how secure and comfortable, just isn't enough anymore. You're not my gigolo. Oh, of course I am. Well you're very nice about it, and very understanding and all that, but that's the truth of it. Or would you rather I said you're an escort? Or your paramour, or how about your housewife? Self pity doesn't become you, Peter, is it absolutely necessary? Yes goddammit, it's necessary, I need a life for myself. Being cooped up inside that apartment all day is driving me nuts. Do you know what happens next month? No. It's my birthday, goddammit. Do you know how old I'm going to be? 32. I don't believe it, you don't even know. I'm going to be 34 fucking years old, 34. What am I doing? Where am I going, Bill, where? I don't know. Well I don't either. I love you, Peter. Somehow that isn't enough anymore, maybe it never was. So I'm the villain. You know I don't believe that. I, I just need some time to sort myself out, find myse-- oh hell. You're free to go whenever you want to, Peter, I won't hold you. [knock knock] Hello, Peter. Bill, I'd like you to meet my wife. Corinne, this is Bill Frayne. He was my roommate when I lived up here. Hi, Pete has told me so much about you. Has he? Oh sure, but only the good things. Well, that was nice of him. Oh, so this is what a New York apartment looks like. You know, Bill, I think it's great that you and Pete were roommates. You see, he's always felt, I don't know, deprived, because he doesn't have any family and all. And I think in a funny sort of way he really looks up to you, like an uncle or something. Peter and I had a real good time when he stayed here. We had a lot of fun. Yeah, that's what Pete tells me. You two going to stay in Fort Lauderdale? Yeah, I think so, all my family's from there and Pete has such a good job it wouldn't make any sense to move. No, I think that's great. But you'll have to come and see us sometime, I'd like that. Sure, I'll do that. Bill, I'm so sorry. Don't be, it's for the best. Mom hadn't recognized any-- anybody in years, thanks anyway. Sure. How are you, Patty? Good. The family? Cliff's just graduated from high school. Mary's engaged to Larry Nixon's boy, Craig. I've been trying to convince Al to stop working. Let some of the younger men do the work but, you know Al, he's always plugging away. Did you know I went back to teaching? No, I didn't. I'm really having a great time. I've got the third grade, it's kind of challenging actually, like inheriting 22 new children every year. That's great. Well I needed something to do with myself. Are you feeling better, Bill? What? Oh, oh sure, I guess you heard about my trip to the hospital for mom. No, that was mostly a scare tactic by my doctor to feel needed. He did force them to retire me three years early, though. I see you haven't stopped smoking. No, it's one of my few pleasures. You should quit. I should do a lot of things. It, it doesn't mean they'll get done. You never came to my wedding. I didn't think you really wanted me there. No, I guess I didn't. I guess it ended when I graduated. It seemed that way to me. Did, did you love me? You know I did. Then-- look, Bill, I, I've got a good life, a happy life. I love Al, he's a wonderful provider, a fine father, I couldn't ask for a better man. But sometimes I wonder, what did I do? What didn't I do? You came back that summer and you'd changed so-- it was like you were a completely different person. But I, I got to get lunch ready. Nice to see you. I'm glad you married Al, he's a good man. I got tired of waiting. I know. Are you satisfied with the way your life has gone? For the most part. Believe me, there was no other way. Take care of yourself. You too. --Beach Island, there is no place like it. REPORTER 1 (ON TV): When you cross the bridge to Long Beach Island you enter another world. It's clean, it's safe, but most of all it's a lot of fun. REPORTER 2 (ON TV): You better believe it, it's the best. REPORTER 1 (ON TV): Long Beach Island, exit 63 on the Garden State parkway. BILL: I'm sorry, Peter, I, I just get lonely. PETER (ON PHONE) I know, me too. BILL: And if Scott is serious about coming up, I'd be glad to show him the city for a few days. PETER (ON PHONE): He shouldn't have asked you. BILL: Oh, I don't mind, really it's fine. PETER (ON PHONE): All right, Bill, I, I just wish he'd have checked with me first. BILL: Oh don't worry, he's old enough to really enjoy seeing the city. PETER (ON PHONE): Well, I just don't want him to be a burden. BILL: It's good to hear your voice, Peter. PETER (ON PHONE): It's been a long time. BILL: And I just want you to know, Peter, that no matter how much I miss you I'm really glad you're happy. PETER (ON PHONE): Thanks, I-- Well take care of yourself. PETER (ON PHONE): So long, Bill. Yeah. [dial tone] MAN (ON TV): It's not that I didn't love her, I just didn't want to be dependant on her. If only I didn't love her so much. If only I didn't love her.
