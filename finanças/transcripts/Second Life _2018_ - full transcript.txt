Second Life See? - You're avoiding me again. - I checked. I checked everything. I know what I'm doing! You said that the last time too. Do you remember what happened? Let's drop it, OK? I don't want to fight either. But people worry about us and keep asking me if you're OK. Why do I have to put up with the embarrassment when it's not even my business? That's enough. Meeting people is a part of my job but now I can't keep my head up! Stop it! Hey! Stop putting me down! Keep it down. I can yell if I want. You're such a disappointment. You're suffocating to be around. I can't stand it. ♪ Happy birthday to you... ♪ ♪ Happy birthday, dear Jung-mi ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Make a wish! Happy birthday! Why you! You're dead! No... no! Hey! Stop it... don't play with food. - Don't! - You look so funny! I'm sorry, ma'am. Hey, no. Oh my gosh, you look so funny! This is meant to be. Go to your new seats. We drew for them, so don't complain. OK. Hi, Sun-hee. Hi. Where did you get your scarf? This? Hold on. I just asked because it looks good. I think it suits you well. Thanks. Hey, this is your new seat? - Where are you? - In the corner. I couldn't get the tickets either. I really want to go to the concert. Probably won't happen, right? I seriously want to be there. Should I try again? Now? But there are no tickets left. I'm dying to go. Seriously. Me too. I heard the tickets are sold out. I doubt we can go. EXO Seoul Concert Tickets Two for $300 Darn it. Dad? Dad? I only got back at dawn. Mum? Yeah. I've checked. I gave them the wrong advice. I haven't told them yet. I don't know. We're not talking about 1% or 2%... I lost almost 10%. Mum. I can forget about getting the award now. They won't give it to me after this blunder. I need to buy workbooks. I should call them soon. I got a text. Asking what happened. Yeah. Yeah, I should tell them. Place the cash in and press "enter". Counting. Please wait. Please make sure you don't leave anything behind. - Is Hyo-jin going? - Yeah. Awesome! We haven't hung out in so long. It's because you're busy with your boyfriend. - No, I'm not. - You totally are. - I swear I'm not... - Hey. I got free tickets to the EXO concert. Do you want them? Really? - Their upcoming concert? - Yeah. I got two tickets. You can go. - Really? Awesome! - That's awesome! I can't believe we get to go! They're sold out. How did you get them? It's... My cousin gave them to me. He works for their management. Really? - Thank you. - Thank you for the tickets. Oh my gosh! I can't believe it! - What do you think? - Let's go. Really? How about... This is our most popular design. What's this? How much did it cost? It's so pretty. - So sparkly too. - Where did you buy it? It's from my boyfriend. You have a boyfriend? I had no idea. We just got together. How did you meet him? Near my apartment. Some tall guy followed me to the library. I got scared and walked faster but he turned out to be really nice. He's a university student. He asked for my number. A university student? Is he cute? Show us your boyfriend's picture. No picture? Of course not. - We just started dating. - Too bad. - Yeah. - I'm curious. It's so pretty. It's really nice. Want to go to the tuck shop? I'll buy. I want to sleep. - What? - Surprised? When? Who is it? He came by yesterday. - How old? - A year younger. He's younger? What's our next class? - History. - Really? - Have you done your homework? - No. - What? You didn't? - I did. - You did? - Just joking. Really. - You didn't do it. - I did. Really. I'm going to the tuck shop. Want me to buy you anything? You need anything? No, it's OK. I'll buy some snacks. Call Hyo-jin and Na-hae too. Let's eat together. The tuck shop was packed. Thank you. Sun-hee went to the tuck shop too. Really? I should've gone with her. - She's clueless. - Who? Sun-hee. Sun-hee? What about her? I obviously don't like her but she keeps asking to hang out. I think she's clueless. No, she knows but pretends she doesn't. - That's creepy. - Yeah. Do you think she really has a boyfriend? It could be true. No way. She obviously made it up. Why would a tall, handsome, university guy ask for her number? Remember when you told us about your boyfriend? - You met him near your place. - Yeah. Then Sun-hee came to school wearing that weird ring saying she met her boyfriend near her place. Isn't she stupid? She's obviously lying. Doesn't she think we'd know? Oh, you're right. Her story is the same as Jung-mi's. She copied your hairstyle too. Maybe she likes you. - My, aren't you popular? - Stop it. That's creepy. Why would she do that? The ring must be expensive. That's what I mean. Anyway, she's a bit weird. "A bit"? She's totally weird. I don't want to mix with her. Don't be like that. Oh, don't be such a goody-goody. It's just... I feel sorry for her. She has no self-confidence. Everyone makes mistakes. I'll give you a chance to make it right. If you raise your hand and own up I'll let it go. Just raise your hand. Now... raise your hand if you've taken what's not yours. OK. Open your eyes and put your hands down. Put your bags on your desks. I'll check them. What? Quiet. Hands on your heads again. Hands up. Ms Kim, I didn't steal it. All right. Not this. Why not? - Let go. - Ms Kim, please. Let go. - What are you doing? - Ms Kim, please. You're just making yourself look guilty. Hey! What are you doing? What's wrong with you? Pregnancy Test Kit It's a pregnancy test kit. Why does she have that? Everyone, close your eyes. Be quiet. Close your eyes! Quiet. You're asking for it. Be quiet! Where's Jung-mi today? She got suspended. - What? - It's true. I heard she asked to be suspended. Why? - To get an abortion. - What? Seriously? That's what I heard. Do you think it's true? That's why she's not here. - So, Jung-mi got suspended. - Really? - She said it was missing? - Yeah. Why else would Ms Kim want to check our bags? She won't see anyone. Wait. This is the practice test Ms Kim gave us. Could you give it to Jung-mi? Sure. Thanks. Jung-mi... Jung-mi! No! Jung-mi! No! Seul-ki? Seul-ki. Seul-ki, that's dangerous. Sit properly. Min-kyeong Too small. This one too. Is this all we have? How's this, Director? Isn't it too big? The rest is too small. Give her that. Change into this for now. You must be cold. Thank you. We'll be outside. Get changed in here. Let's go. Where did you find her? On my way back from town. I found her shivering in the street. She won't say where she lives? She won't say anything. Why not? That's weird. And why was she wet out in the cold? She must have her reasons. Hurry up and eat. What's her name? Ask her yourself. What's your name? Are you going to be living with us? Why won't you say anything? Why you! I know you didn't wash up. Liar liar, pants on fire. Seul-ki. Good morning. - Slept well? - Yes. Can you help Jin-ho wash up? Sure. Come here. I'll leave you to it. Come here. Close your eyes. So cute. - You don't need to hold your breath. - OK. There. Close your eyes. You too. Wash up. Looks delicious. Seul-ki, which one do you like the best? - How about this one? - That one? Yeah, that's a good one. It looks good. OK. Take care. - Let's go. - I'll carry it. It's OK. - It's heavy. - It's not heavy at all! Let me carry it. - Take this. - Just this? Yeah. The kids will love it. - You don't have to. - Seul-ki. - Welcome. - Hi. Let's go back. Stay. Just for a while. I think this one is nice. - Looking for anything in particular? - Yes. It's for her. I'd like a warm coat, something trendy. - One moment, please. - Sure. - I don't need it. - It's OK. It won't cost much. Is this a little too mature for you? - So cold. - I'm freezing! Let's see. Know what you want? No, I don't. Choose something for me. - How's this? - No thanks! - It suits you. - No. - How's this? - It's nice. - She can try it on. - Thanks. Seul-ki, do you like it? - Seul-ki. - Yes? How's this? Doesn't it look warm? Yes. - It does look nice. - Yeah. - Isn't it too expensive? - Don't worry. Try it on. But I don't need it. I've never bought you anything. Try it on. OK. How is it? It's pretty. ♪ Happy birthday to you... ♪ ♪ Happy birthday, dear Min-kyeong ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ - Blow! - Blow it out! - Happy birthday! - What's that? Hey, you silly girl. Let's take a group photo! Hey, let's take a photo. - Gather around. - Let's take a photo. Look that way... Scoot closer together. - Sit down. - Gather around. - Come here. - Gather around. - Come here. - No, it's OK. I don't like taking pictures. Come on. Take one with us. It's a group photo. Come here. Come on... - Come here and take it with us. - Come on. - Wait. - What? - Soon-young has to poop. - What? - Hold on. - Wait. What? I'll take her. - Let's go. - Thanks. - Let's go... - Then, you take her. Let's take a picture. Get ready... smile. OK, smile. - Look this way. - Gather around. One, two, three! Seul-ki? Bend over. - Ready? - Yes. OK. Your pants. Look at me. All done? Yeah. I'll carry you. Let's go. Seul-ki? Ma'am? - What's this? - Take a look. To go to high school you must pass an equivalency test. I see. Why? You don't like studying? It's not that. I'm just not sure if I should go to school. That's because you've never been to school. Aren't you curious about school life? I'll send you if you want to go. Think it over. OK. Seul-ki? What are you doing? I'm not sleepy. You sleep first. Kyung Moon Girls' High School Admission Test Hope Orphanage Yoon-seo too? - Packed everything? - Yes, ma'am. - Good luck there. - OK. Bye. The kids are sad to see you go.

Hey. Why are you eating alone? How did you wake up so early? I couldn't open my eyes. - Hi, Floor Representative. - Hi. - Her name's Seul-ki. - I know. Then why did you call her that? Because she is one. That's not her name. Fine, you win. Poophead. - Hey, we're eating here. - Poop, poop, poop! - Hey! - Poop! They're always like that. So gross. You know each other? Yeah. We went to the same school. Which school are you from? I got in through the equivalency test. You were home schooled? Yeah. - Wow, that's cool! - Yeah. It's hard to get into this school. How did you study? I did the mock tests. - That's all? - You must be smart. Can I come to you if I need help? But you don't study. - She doesn't study. - Yes, I do. Never mind. Just teach me.

You're nuts. It's nice here. Bang-wul. When did you start taking pictures? Me? When I was 10 or 11, I think. I found a disposable camera at home. I started taking pictures from then on. That's how I started. - Is it fun? - Yeah. I lose track of time when I take pictures. I'll major in photography in university. I'll take your picture. Don't. Come on. Just once?
