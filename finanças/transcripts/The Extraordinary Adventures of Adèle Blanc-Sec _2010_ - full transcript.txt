♪♪ Whew! Well, Naomi, here we are. My favorite view of the city. You were right, Elena. It was worth the hike, even if there was no path. Well, there used to be one. But I haven't been up here in 41 years. Oh, right. You were stuck in that amulet. Yes. That's kind of why I wanted to come up here. There's something I need to show you. What is that? This wand belonged to Shuriki, the sorceress who invaded Avalor. The one who put you in that amulet? Sort of. It's time I told you the whole story-- how I lost everything and everyone I loved, and how I finally found my way back home. The truth is, I would still be trapped in that amulet today if it wasn't for a brave young princess named Sofia. Mama, Papa! Vadisima! Vadisima! You okay, Sof? That was weird. It was like I just had a dream, but I was wide awake. It's called daydreaming. I do it all the time. Children, as I was saying, I hope you all have a wonderful summer. Class is dismissed. - ( bell tolling ) - ( kids chattering ) Have your steward write my steward. Oh, I can't wait to find out where Daddy is taking us for our summer trip. Come along, Sofia. Yeah, we better get home. And I better get to the secret library. KING ROLAND: The kids will be here any minute, Miranda. We have to figure out where we're taking them. What about Corinthia? I was hoping to go someplace we haven't been before. The kingdom could use a new trading partner. We're home! So, where are we going, Daddy? We're still trying to figure that out, Amber. I wish to be small. "The Lost Princess of Avalor"? Like the Amulet of Avalor? Exactly like the Amulet of Avalor. ( gasps ) Don't be so alarmed. I know I am not the first talking book you've seen here. Usually, they just tell the stories. They don't talk to me. Well, this book was made by a powerful wizard. Who? Me. Alacazar. The royal wizard of Avalor. Well, I was a royal wizard, before I turned myself into a talking book. Why did you do that? It is a long story, which I am about to tell you, so get comfy. Whoa! Across the great ocean, in the enchanted kingdom of Avalor, there once lived a young princess named Elena. On her 15th birthday, her mother, Queen Lucia, gave her a magical amulet, the Amulet of Avalor, a family heirloom, passed down from generation to generation, that would protect her from harm. But one fateful day, Queen Shuriki, an evil, power-hungry sorceress from the northern islands, invaded Avalor. She attacked the king and queen, then set her sights upon the palace. Princess Elena bravely chose to face Shuriki on her own, so that her family would be spared. I saw this before in my daydream. That was Elena's way of calling you here, so I could tell you the whole story. Now, when Shuriki tried to strike her down, the amulet saved Elena by pulling her inside it. And that is how the princess wound up inside your amulet. There's a princess inside my amulet? And she's been there for 41 years. But this is the most important part. Shuriki thought she had gotten rid of Elena, but she was wrong. I soon discovered that the only way to get her out of the amulet was to find a special princess who could set her free. I searched the globe for years until I grew too old to continue, and used the last of my magic to transform myself into this book, so that someday, her story could have a happy ending. And at last, it seems Elena finally found the princess we have been searching for. She chose me? You catch on quickly. I like that. Now, in order to find Elena, you must travel to my home in Avalor, and summon my chanul. Wait. I have to do what? Go to my home in Avalor and summon my chanul. But be careful, for Queen Shuriki still rules Avalor, and is as powerful and evil as ever. So you probably want to keep your distance. I can see you are unsure. Listen, Elena tested many princesses before you. She granted them powers and curses, but you are the only one she chose, and she has been preparing you for this day since you first put on the amulet. So you can do this if you choose to. Her story is in your hands now, Sofia. It is up to you how it ends. I don't care where the dart landed, James. We are not going to the North Pole. I know where we should go. We should go to Avalor. - What? - Avalor? That's so far away. And we need to visit a kingdom we can trade with.

The kingdom of Avalor. SOFIA: How am I going to find Alacazar's house in that huge city? ROLAND: Good morning, Admiral Vazquez. Your Majesty. Have you sent word of our arrival to Queen Shuriki? - We sent a launch an hour ago. - Excellent. Why did you do that? It's the royal custom to greet the king or queen when visiting a new kingdom, Sofia. We have to meet her? Yes. Isn't it exciting? Queen Shuriki! Oh! Don't sneak up on me like that, Esteban. Can't you see I'm putting on my best face for our visitors? Oh, should I come back when you are finished? I am finished. Of course you are, my queen. My mistake. It is time to greet King Roland of Enchancia. Everything must look its absolute best, Armando. Yes, Your Grace. I have spent years making this the cleanest, quietest, most orderly kingdom in the world. Nothing is out of place, everyone does what they're told, no unruliness. No irritating jingle-jangle of bells or music. Just simple peace and quiet. No one will make a peep, Your Grace. Except the cheers of my subjects, of course. And the cheering crowds will be cheering this time, correct, Esteban? We sent the royal guards ahead to offer encouragement. Perfect. ( cheering ) Hello. Hello. This is quite a welcome. I'll say. Hello. Hello! They really like me. Oh, they like her even more. I'd keep my distance, Amber. Yes, your beloved queen has arrived. Cheer like you mean it. Welcome to Avalor. I am Queen Shuriki. And I am Chancellor Esteban. Oh, it is an honor that you have chosen to visit our humble kingdom. You honor us with such a warm reception, Queen Shuriki. That is the Avaloran way, King Roland. ( flute music plays ) Oh, what pretty music. Now let us adjourn to the palace. Esteban, the flute. Hey! ( boy crying ) After you, princess. The palace was built centuries ago. It's a little busy, if you ask me. And this is my throne room. I spend most of my time here. So what do you think? That's quite a throne. Thank you. Took them over a decade to dig up all the diamonds. But it was worth the wait. ( gasps ) Don't touch that! James, where are your manners? It's a very delicate fabric. Come along, my boy. You must all be famished after such a long journey, so I... I mean, the queen, had the chefs prepare a small taste of the local cuisine. MIRANDA: Oh, it's such a lovely view from up here, Queen Shuriki. I can't wait to go back down to the city and look at all the beautiful old houses. Old houses? That's the last thing you should be looking at, dear. Our marketplace and park lands are second to none. Esteban, clear my schedule. I shall personally give our guests a tour of the city this afternoon. Hey, hey, what's for lunch, Shuriki? What are those? Oh, those are jaquins. Magical creatures of legend. Majestic symbols of Avalor. They used to be symbols of our kingdom. Now they are just a nuisance. Why is that? Because we sing. Ha ha! ♪ From the misty jungle highlands ♪ ♪ We fan our wings and fly ♪ ♪ To delight all Avalorans ♪ ♪ With our mighty jaquin cry ♪ They're singing! Can you believe that, Sofia? Talking animals! Who ever heard of such a thing? Let's dig in, amigos! Oh, ho, ho, that looks tasty. LUNA: Hey, save room for dessert, Skylar. My compliments to the chef and whoever said you should eat outside, 'cause that is a great idea! Brilliant. Oh, shoo. Get out of here, you pests. Aw, but we just got here. You can tell the people what to do, but you can't boss us around. Mess with a jaquin, you get the claws. That's it. Enough is enough. Let's finish our meal inside, shall we? Yes, yes. Let's all go inside. ( jaquins laughing ) Mmm. Food tastes better when we take it from Shuriki. It's paw-licking good. LUNA: This mango is sublime. Um, excuse me. Hey, what are you still doing out here? I'm not exactly sure, but maybe you can help me. We do not help friends of Shuriki. I'm not her friend. My family had to visit the palace. I really came here to find Alacazar's house. Who's Alacazar? He was the old royal wizard. Remember? Oh, yeah. Didn't he split after Shuriki took over? Who can blame him? She probably would've zapped him like the king and queen, and Princess Elena. - So young. - So brave. - Poor Elena. Well, what if I told you I know a way to bring Princess Elena back? You better not be toying with me, little girl, because I am highly emotional and extremely gullible. I'm telling the truth. So if one of you knows where Alacazar's house is, maybe you could take me there. Whoa ho now, what do we look like, flying horses? Do you see a saddle on this back? Relax, you two. - What's your name? - Sofia. Well, Sofia, if you can bring back Elena, I'll take you to Alacazar's house, as soon as someone tells me where it is. It's right below the moon cliff. One of the old timers showed me once. Hop on, Your Highness. Thanks. This is gonna take some getting used to. Hold on! Your kingdom is beautiful. It looked even better before Shuriki took over. Sure did. And sounded better, too. What do you mean? - She outlawed music. - Why? Because she wanted everyone to forget the old Avalor. That's why we jaquins still sing. To remind everyone that the spirit of Avalor lives on. And 'cause it really bugs Shuriki. ♪ Way back in the old days ♪ ♪ Before the time of Shuriki ♪ ♪ You could always hear music ♪ ♪ In the streets of the city ♪ ♪ Although now it is quiet ♪ ♪ And the bells are not ringing ♪ ♪ If you listen real closely ♪ ♪ You can hear our hearts singing ♪ ♪ All across the kingdom ♪ ♪ The people are still strong ♪ ♪ Because the spirit of Avalor ♪ ♪ Continues to live on ♪ ♪ Yes, every man and woman ♪ ♪ Everyone, everywhere ♪ ♪ Even children do their parts ♪ ♪ To uphold the spirit of Avalor ♪ ♪ With a song inside their hearts ♪ ♪ Avalor, Avalor ♪ ♪ They uphold the spirit of Avalor ♪ ♪ With a song inside their hearts ♪ ♪ The queen hushes their voices ♪ ♪ But we gladly sing for them ♪ - ♪ The guards, they do not like it ♪ - No, they don't. ♪ - But we simply ignore them ♪ - Yes, we do. ♪ We all yearn for the day when ♪ ♪ That old queen is sent packin' ♪ ♪ And you'll hear better music ♪ - ♪ Than the sound of us jaquins ♪ - That's for sure! ♪ All across the kingdom ♪ ♪ The people are still strong ♪ ♪ Because the spirit of Avalor ♪ ♪ Continues to live on ♪ ♪ Yes, every man and woman ♪ ♪ Everyone, everywhere ♪ ♪ Even children do their part ♪ ♪ To uphold the spirit of Avalor ♪ ♪ With a song inside their hearts ♪ ♪ Avalor, Avalor ♪ ♪ From the parrots in their treetops ♪ ♪ To the merchants in their carts ♪ ♪ We feel the spirit of Avalor ♪ ♪ Way down deep inside our hearts ♪ ♪ Everyone, everywhere ♪ ♪ We hold the spirit of Avalor ♪ ♪ Avalor, Avalor ♪ ♪ With a song inside our hearts ♪ ♪ Avalor, Avalor ♪ This is it. Whew! That was a workout. Hello. Can I help you? Hi. Uh, was this Alacazar's house? Alacazar? I'm sorry, but he has not lived here for many years. I know, but maybe you can help me. I need to summon his chanul. I don't know what that is, but I'm afraid you won't find it here. Good day now. Well, that could've gone better. How do you know what a chanul is? Oh, well... That was my mom you were just talking to. I'm Mateo. Wait. You're Alacazar's grandson? You know my grandfather? Uh, sort of. My name is Sofia. I know this might sound strange, but your grandfather sent me here to free Princess Elena. Princess Elena?! Wait. That means... that's the Amulet of Avalor. Yes. How did you know? My mother told me the story so many times, I memorized it. Follow me. - Where are we going? - To my workshop. Wish me luck. It's a long way down. I know, but it's the only way to keep everything secret. When Queen Shuriki took over, she banned all magic except her own. So there are no wizards in Avalor? Not anymore. My grandma hid all my grandpa's things down here, but my mother never wanted anything to do with it. So it sat here all locked up until I found it. I've been trying to teach myself magic ever since. Okay, now let me think. I just need a few things. Okay, sit here, Sofia. Why? We're going to summon my grandpa's chanul. What is a chanul exactly? A spirit animal. It's like a guide to all the magical stuff in the world that we can't see, like Princess Elena. It was my grandpa's chanul who figured out she was in the amulet and told him how to get her out. Here we go. Now where's my tamborita? Okay, this is the first time I've tried this incantation, so it may not work for the first eight or nine times. Maybe ten. Ahem. Appear to us, animal spirit of Alacazar. Illuminara Alacazar wayohel! It's okay. I have another drumstick. Let's try that again. Illuminara Alacazar wayohel! ( gasps ) Huh? What's happening? I am. Greetings from the spirit world! How ya doin' today? O mighty chanul, you honor us with your presence. Hey, I know you're excited. I get it. It's not every day you meet a spirit animal, right? But you called me, I'm here, so we can skip all the fanfare, and get on with it, okay? Of course, mighty chanul. Oh, you can call me Zuzo. Yes, of course, mighty Zuzo. You don't have to call me anything. So, you're the princess that's gonna free Elena. I guess so. All right then. Now here's what you gotta do. Wait. I thought I just had to summon you. Uh-huh, so I can tell you how to get her out. That's what spirit guides do. They guide you. First, you're gonna need the wand that put Elena in there. Queen Shuriki's wand? But she keeps it in her pocket. That's great. You'll know exactly where to find it. Now, once you've got the wand, you just wrap the amulet around it and put 'em on the crown of Aziluna. - The crown of who? - Aziluna. He was a great healer who could undo any spell or curse. There's an ancient Maruvian statue of him way up in the mountains. It's kinda like a hospital for magical mishaps. But I don't know where it is, or how to get there, or how I'm going to steal Shuriki's wand. Okay, let's all take a big breath. In. Out. Good. Now I've got some spirit animal wisdom for you. Just because you're the one doesn't mean you're the only one. That's not supposed to make any sense right now. You'll get it later. But first, you gotta go get that wand, princess. All right, it's been a pleasure being your spirit guide today. Safe travels. Bye. How great was that?! I summoned my first chanul! Sorry. Whoa! Hey, nice move. I bet you're a good dancer, aren't you? That's how I'll get her wand. I'll dance with her. That won't work. Shuriki outlawed dancing when she banned music. My mom still taught me the sambarosa, though. - We have to go back to the palace. - We? ARMANDO: And when the farmer followed her into the jungle, she turned into a jaguar! But really, she was a wicked witch who had taken over the jungle. The farmer tried to escape... Our kingdom has a wide array of enchanted agriculture, and creatures, not to mention our flying horses. Forget trading with Enchancia. We should invade it. Here you are, princess. You were out there a while, Sofia. The jaquins sang me a song. Yes, they can't seem to stop doing that. Well, Armando is putting on a show for the other little darlings if you want to join them. Actually, I was hoping to learn one of the Avaloran dances I've heard so much about. The sambarosa. Oh, I'm afraid I don't know that dance. It's the most famous dance in Avalor. I can teach it to her. No, you won't, Armando. More tea, Your Grace? Why not? Is there some kind of law against dancing? Sofia, no one would pass a law against dancing. That's like passing a law against fun. Well, in Avalor, we-- We only dance on special occasions, like royal visits. So we will be happy to show you the sambarosa. Right, Your Grace? If we must. Let me fetch the guitar. Great. This is how you dance the sambarosa. You join hands and stomp your feet like this. Move back and forth, then twirl your partner. Whoo! Come on. Everyone try! ( both laughing ) ( giggling ) ( laughing ) Queen Shuriki, will you dance with me? Oh, how sweet of you to offer, but I'm having too much fun watching you. But I'm sure you dance better than anyone. Please? How can I say no to such a dear child? ( gasps ) Ow! So sorry, Your Grace. I'm so clumsy. Enough dancing! ( chuckles ) I mean, so delightful. We really must get back to our discussions, Your Majesties. Can we play hide-and-seek? Yes, yes, yes. Whatever you want, dear. We can dispose of that now, Esteban. Sofia, I don't wanna play hide-and-seek. It'll be fun, Amber. Is it okay if we hide and you seek, Mr. Armando? Oh, of course. That would be delightful. Okay. One, two, three, four... Come on. Five, six, seven, eight... ( counting continues ) What are you up to, Sofia? I'll explain later, but I need you both to hide as long as you can. It's important. - You got it, Sof. - Why won't you tell us? It's for your own good, trust me. Hmm. I got it! Right on, Sofia! I don't know how you pulled that off. Shuriki never lets anyone get close to her. Look at her. Girl looks sweet as sugar, but she's got some skills. Okay, Mateo, show us the way to Aziluna. We've got a princess to free. SOFIA: What's that? An old Maruvian temple. The statue is inside. Whoa, man, they really let the place go. The Maruvians vanished centuries ago. No one knows what happened to them or where they went. All that's left of the ancient civilization of Maru are ruins like this. SOFIA: Where's the statue? Well, legend has it you need to swim across the enchanted waters for the magic to work. You'll be fine, Sofia. Good luck. Okay. ( grunting ) Being a mermaid would really come in handy right about now. ( gasps ) Whoa! Did you see that? I wish I could shape shift that easily. ( gasps ) That must be it. Right. I have to put the amulet and wand on the crown of Aziluna. Whoa! Whoa! My amulet. It changed color. Princess Elena? ( laughs ) I'm free! I'm finally free! Whoa! - Are you okay? - I'm good. I'm good. I guess that's what happens when you're stuck inside an amulet for 41 years. You forget how to walk. I knew you were the one! Thank you. You're... welcome. Princess Elena! Oh, jaquins. Princess Elena. Princess Elena! ( nervous giggle ) I'm Mateo. Alacazar's grandson. Oh, you don't have to bow, Mateo. And you can just call me Elena. Okay, Elena. I can't believe you're really back. Neither can I. I was in the amulet so long, I thought I might never get out.

Where are you going? To give Shuriki a taste of her own magic. But Queen Shuriki is really powerful. Not without her wand. Wait. I'll come with you. - Me, too. - No. No. You've already risked so much for me. This is something I have to do alone. Let's go. We've got to help her. Let's go. Right. Go, Luna. Catch that princess. LUNA: Let's do it! Where are those children? Come out, come out, wherever you are. Any of you. Please. You want me to go with you? Thanks, but I've got this. The trade agreement is ready for your signature, Your Grace. Done. Now that that's taken care of... ELENA: Shuriki! - Huh? - Huh? Princess Elena! The time has come to pay for your crimes. Crimes? What crimes? Shuriki invaded Avalor, and overthrew the royal family. My family. Is this true? Oh, Elena. Some inherit their kingdoms. Others have to take theirs by force. Hey! Then I'm here to take mine back. But Avalor has been so much better without you. Why ruin a good thing? Looking for this? How did you get that? It was that little princess. The one with the necklace. Wait. Sofia's involved in this? Yes. She freed me from her amulet, so that I could free Avalor from you. Oh, I don't know about that. It takes more than a wand to make you a sorceress. Your spell has echoed in my mind for 40 years, Shuriki. I know it by heart. Vadisima! ( evil laugh ) You'll have to do better than that. Vadisima! ( gasps ) What is this? I've never seen this painting before. Oh, that's no ordinary painting, Elena. That's how Alacazar protected your little sister and grandparents-- inside an enchanted painting even my magic cannot touch. Abuelo. Abuela. Isabel. And speaking of family, you haven't said hello to your cousin Esteban. ( nervous stammer ) No. This cannot be Esteban. You were stuck in that amulet a long time. You may still be 16, but Esteban grew up. Wait. You're with her? I... I had no choice, Elena. ( laughs ) Is that so, Esteban? Vadisima! Seize her! ( panting ) Found ya! Oh! Uh, what's going on? Nothing, Armando. I'm just setting things back in order. Hey, not so fast, Shuriki! ( gasps ) Hop on, Elena. No, wait. Don't leave, Skylar. Vadisima! Guards, stop them! I want her captured by nightfall. Her and that little princess. Leave Sofia out of this. And lock them up while you're at it. MIRANDA: Get your hands off me! You'll regret this. I doubt it. Wait. Wait. Skylar, we have to go back. Why? So she can finish you off? You are brave, princess, but your battle strategy, not so good. Elena, what happened? I tried my best, Sofia, but I couldn't get the spell right, and Shuriki has your family now. She has my family? I'm so sorry. There she is. Archers, lock your arrows. Draw! Whoa. They're shooting arrows! Evasive action. Dodge and weave. Yeah, we could do that. Or we could just get on up outta here. - We can go to my place. - Great. Hang on. Oh, I hope they're okay. This is not okay, Roland. Where is Sofia? I will get us out of here, Miranda, and we will find Sofia. The prisoners are secured, Chancellor Esteban. Those prisoners are royalty, and you will treat them as such. Yes, chancellor. Ay yi yi. Yet another mess to clean up. So Princess Elena lives. Apparently so. She is the rightful heir to the throne. We should be helping her. What do you suggest we do, hmm? Fight the queen? Because we will lose. But Elena's your cousin, Esteban. And her grandparents raised me like a son. And I think about what happened to them every day. So I do not need you to remind me, Armando. Elena, what happened back there? I never knew what happened to my sister and my grandparents until today. Seeing them trapped in that painting reminded me of the last time I saw Isabel. - Isabel? - My little sister. She'd been out in the garden all day, building a new feeder for the jaquins. She was filthy, and our parents were on their way home for dinner, so I asked her to change. And she comes back wearing a clean dress, but her hands and face are still covered in dirt. I had just finished cleaning her off when I heard our parents' carriage pull up outside. And then, Shuriki arrived. I'm sorry. When I saw her in that enchanted painting today, she still had a smudge on her cheek. I guess I missed a spot. ( door creaking ) We have the spell that can get them out. - We do? - We do. Your grandfather showed me where it was before he left, but I never learned magic, so I cannot cast the spell. You will have to do it, Mateo. And, uh, why would I be able to do it? Mateo, you're down there in the basement practicing magic day and night. You think I don't know this? But Elena, I must warn you. To bring them out with Shuriki still in power will put them in great danger. - ( horses approaching ) - ( knocking ) We have visitors. Quick, hide, over there. - ( knocking ) - Okay. Coming, coming. Rafa, did you hear? They're saying that Princess Elena has returned. Oh, hurry. Hurry. Come inside. We have to be careful. Princess Elena, it's okay. We can trust them. It is true. The princess lives! My princess. You don't have to bow. Oh, okay. We are at your command. I will take on Shuriki myself. Thank you, all of you, but this is my fight, not yours. I'm the one who must face her. You may be the one, but you're not the only one. Zuzo said that, and now I know what he meant. Okay. What did he mean? We can all help. You don't need to face Shuriki alone. You just need to tell us what to do. Hmm. You know, all this time I was stuck in the amulet, I thought I was alone, but you're right, Sofia. It doesn't have to be that way. I have all of you. Yeah, but what good are we against Shuriki and all her soldiers? I'm still figuring that out, but I'm going to need everyone's help. - We're with you. - All the way. Not just you. Everyone. Where are we? A secret back entrance to the palace. Not that I ever snuck out when I wasn't supposed to. I'll see you at the rendezvous point, Skylar. You better. How will we find my family? There's only one place Shuriki would've put them. Princess Elena?! Hey there. You look like a nice guy who just wants to do the right thing. I do? I mean, I do. Whatever you need, princess. I am at your service. Ahem. Excuse me, but Queen Shuriki wants the both of you to report to her right away. I'll go. You stay here. No, but she asked to see the both of you. One of us has to watch the prisoners. Um, wait. Hold on. That hurts. Oh, one of the guards wouldn't leave. Sofia, if you shrank down, you could sneak right past that guard. But you're not in my amulet anymore. Do you think I still have my powers? There's only one way to find out. I wish I was small. ( yells ) Armando, I need you to distract the guard. Hello. Excuse me. Hello. What is it now? There's something very, very important I must tell you. Over here. I wish to be big again. - Hi. - ALL: Sofia! Sh. We have to hurry. You have a lot of explaining to do. Mom, I will... later. I promise. But right now, we have to find a way to get past that guard. I'll take care of him. And when the farmer followed her into the jungle, she turned into a jaguar! This is the important thing you had to tell me? You haven't heard the ending yet. Grab him! Got him! Well done. Dad, this is Princess Elena. I'm sorry for the danger I put your family in. But I've waited so many years for the one princess that could free me from the amulet, and that was Sofia. I sensed it from the very first day she moved into your castle. So when I was picking out Sofia's welcome gift, it was you who made the amulet glow? Yes. I needed someone young enough to get close to Shuriki without making her suspicious, but brave and clever enough to get me out. So you shouldn't be mad at her. You should be proud. Sofia, you still should've told us what was going on. I know. I just wanted to keep you all out of trouble. Well, it's too late for that. I think a pardon may be in order just this once. I have a plan to get you all to safety, but we have to hurry. I'm losing my patience, Esteban. Where is Princess Elena? Queen Shuriki, when I helped you invade Avalor, you promised me that no one in my family would be hurt. I also promised you power, and look at you now, Chancellor Esteban. Just be happy I kept one of my promises, or you'll wind up like your aunt and uncle. You wanted to see me, Your Grace. I don't want to see anyone until those princesses are found. Hey there, Shuriki. Long time no see. I've put up with you buzzards outside, but not in my palace. But it's so comfy in here. Ooh, here's a nice little perch. Get off my throne. - Vadisima! - Missed me! Capture that beast. You heard the queen. Move! Yes, sir. Okay, let's see the spell. Whoa. Tlah...cui...lolli...? Oh, boy, that's a tongue twister. ELENA: Mateo! Oh, it's you. Oh, Isabel! You have to get them out, Mateo. Now. ( sighs ) Okay. Tlahcuilolli apartad. Tlahcuilolli apareced. Tlahcuilolli vivid! - Isabel! - Elena! I missed you so much. Let me just... You're safe. Abuelo, abuela. ABUELO: The palace looks so different. - What happened to Shuriki? - She's still here. I never should've let Alacazar put us in that painting. Uh, can we talk about this later? We have to go. Everyone hurry. Get on a jaquin. Whoa, princess. You should've given me a head count. Some of you may have to double up. These jaquins will take your family back to your ship, and we're taking the others. Since when do people ride jaquins? Don't get used to it. I'm not running away from Shuriki again, Elena. We're not running away, abuela. You'll see. I'm going to stay and help Elena. What? If I knew that, I would've gotten on another bird thingy. We should help, too, Rollie. I intend to, but the children should return to the ship where it's safe. We'll be okay, Dad. We won't be alone. Everyone's coming. ROLAND: What do you mean, everyone? MAN: Come on. We're going to the castle. - Viva Avalor! - ALL: Viva Avalor! ( all chattering ) Hey, Shuriki. I'm getting a little lonely up here. ( laughs ) You again. Vadisima! ( screams ) Too slow. - Vadisima! - ( laughs ) Missed me again. You're gonna have to aim better than that if you're gonna zap me. Oh, I will, you pest. Vadisima! Oh. Uh-huh. Nice shot, Shuriki. Well, it's been a blast distracting you, - but I'm outta here. - Distracting me? What is she talking about, Esteban? - ( voices nearby ) - What? What is that sound? They're coming, Your Majesty. Who is coming? All of Avalor. ( people singing ) Is that... singing? ( singing continues ) ♪ So we will march to the palace once more ♪ ♪ To bring back the freedom of all Avalor ♪ ♪ We've spent our whole lives waiting just for this day ♪ ♪ And nothing, no, nothing ♪ ♪ Will stand in our way ♪ ♪ This is our time ♪ ♪ Together as one, we won't fail ♪ ♪ Our time ♪ ♪ This time we know we'll prevail ♪ ♪ Our time ♪ ♪ To honor our family and friends ♪ ♪ Our time ♪ ♪ This is our time ♪ ♪ Once again ♪ - Halt! - Stop right there. I'll take care of them. Brace yourself, Miranda. They locked the gate. We'll have to break it down. Or we can fly around the other side and open it. That'll work, too. Stay together. Stay strong! GUARD: Stand firm, men. Stop in the name of the queen. ( gasps ) Stop them! - There's just too many. - Retreat! Run! I think I'll just go over here now. Cowards! Enough! Obscuras! ( thunder rumbling ) Leave my palace at once. It's not your palace, Shuriki. It's ours, and you can't stop all of us. I don't have to. I only need to stop you. Esteban! What are you doing? Elena, catch. Ha! You can't use the wand on me, girl. Maybe so, but let's see how powerful you are without it. Shuriki, your reign is over. ( all gasping ) No. ( sobbing ) She's gone, Elena. We won. After all these years. All hail the rightful heir of Avalor, Princess Elena! ( people cheering ) Wait. I'm in charge of the kingdom now? You are the eldest child. The crown goes to you. It does? You will be a great ruler, Elena. And you'll have your grandfather and I to help you, so there's nothing to worry about. Now go and address your people. Right. Address my people. Okay. Hello. Hi. How are you? Hey there. And thank you for everything. Elena, I guess this belongs to you. Sofia, I want you to have it, for all you've done for Avalor. Besides, I think I've seen enough of that amulet for a lifetime. Thank you, Elena. Thank you, cousin. For a moment, I wasn't sure whose side you were on. I was always on our side, but I couldn't let Shuriki find a way to destroy that painting. Our family was in there. And so, I pretended to follow her to keep them safe. I hope you understand, Elena. - Elena! - Isa! Any time you need a ride, princess, I'm your jaquin. Let every bell in Avalor ring. We are free! ( bells tolling ) - How was that? - Great. SOFIA: "And all across the kingdom, the people of Avalor cheered, for their lost princess had finally come home. Thus began the reign of Princess Elena, and with it, a new age of joy and prosperity for all of Avalor." Wonderful. I would call that a very happy ending. It is, but I don't think her story is over just yet. Of course it isn't, but what happens next is a tale for another book. Thank you for all you have done, Sofia. And this is for the journey ahead. Which brings me to this. I need to figure out what to do with the pieces of her wand. Well, you could just toss 'em off the cliff. I was thinking of something a little more secure. I know. You could... No, that's too obvious. Hmm. I know. We can hide them in the treasury, and not tell anyone where we put it. Yes. It'll be the best-guarded secret in Avalor. Thanks, Naomi. What are friends and Grand Counselors for? ( laughs ) So, should we head back down? Are you sure you don't need more rest? You are 57, after all. ( laughs ) Well, as my abuela says, time spent in magical jewelry doesn't count. Then we better go. The kingdom's not gonna rule itself. Right.
