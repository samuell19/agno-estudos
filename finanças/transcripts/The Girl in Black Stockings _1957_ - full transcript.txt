Well, it may be because I love to be in your arms. But it could be the altitude. Maybe I should have found with Marcia Morgan. "I'm glad it was not like that. "That's not good to say." To say that I went to the psychiatrist and that I left the city... it was one of the best things what happened to me. I think they were thinking of you. Yes, it had to be someone. somewhere, I'm glad it was me. A cigarette? No thank you. I dont smoke. You know, I was just thinking. Los Angeles, gray flannel suit,... top court, records, judgments, grand juries... Suddenly they seem to have disappeared from my life. Suddenly they seem to be to 500 years of distance, instead of 500 miles. Kanab, Utah. How did we get here, Beth? Getting in your car and driving, no matter where. I might like this car. - What happened? - There! There! - What is it? - Let's see! It's Marcia Morgan. I think it is. What happened? Who screamed? What is going on? - Go find the sheriff. - For what? Stay where you are! Go find the sheriff. Sure, I'm coming. I'm sorry to call you, Ben, but I have who do an official investigation. The boys of Saint Lake will require a report. Something like that has never happened here. I'm used to marrying people. and bury old dead. You're not going to bury her. Amos, you have to point Is this thing so close? I'm sorry, Jess. - Hello Ben. - Jess... It's all yours, doc. Let's get this over with. "George, do you want to lower that light?" - Yes, Jess. Amos, will you do me a favor? Go ahead, doc. A real psychopath. Cutting of knife in the neck, here he cut the jugular. Too fast for her to scream. He should be in front of her. So he was not a stranger? I would say no. Cross-cut eyes and lips, there is mutilation here... It should have 10 or 12 cuts. This part of your body the same frenetic disfigurement. Even on the legs. Sexual assault? I can not guarantee that. He would have to examine her at the hospital. "Anything else, Doctor?" - No, that's all. Any questions, Ben? Satisfied with the procedure? How not? That makes it official. We finished. You may have just begun, Jess. There are cases in the files on the kind of criminal who did it. They do not stop with the first one. Julia. You suppose, one more step to put my king in danger. Why do you consider the sacrifice of a simple pawn? I wondered about this sacrifice, Edmund, the risks involved. Who or what is really important, Edmund? What do you want to keep? What is in this world that worth keeping? Julia, you put yourself in vulnerable situation. My horse will attack your queen. He's going to kill her. "And that will break that." - Edmund! It's getting late. I wish I could stop to think about tomorrow. I wish we could come back a hundred years. "You'll need all your strength." - I have my strength! I'm not a crying kid who gets tired play with your toes. Give me a brandy, Julia. Why did she have to stay? Why did not you? the suitcases and gone? It's over now. You'll never hurt anyone again. It is poison. Like a disease. I ruined your life, right? I do not know why you do similar sacrifice for his brother. Do not talk like that, Edmund. It's not like this. Yes it has been. You scratch my ear when it bothers me. You blow my nose, you Give me the food I eat. All the skills of a nanny. No, many women dominate art sound a man's nose. In fact, my nose needs to sound right now. Must be our protector. two innocent Be sure to clean the shoes before entering! - Hello! - Hello, Jess. Yes, I know. Clean shoes before entering. Enter. Go ahead, Holmes. Be brief and go to the point. People say they would speak less if he were dead. It may be the fervent desire of a consummation. This will be in November, this is now. I have a job to do. I do not like this, but I have to do this. Tonight a girl was killed and cut like a steak. The devouring witch of men, he deserved it... but I could have chosen a damn public place... like the caravan camp of Zion National Park, - or Bryce Canyon. - Please, Edmund. But she did not. You have been registered at your hotel. We have a crazy man out there. and we have to find out who it is... and you have here some of the guests. Very nice of you take over control. I have no choice, Ed. It's your people... is that you... It's Julia... I think you'd better leave. When it's over, Ed! Julia, you were close to Three Lakes tonight? Do not. Yes, I have. I think everyone in the Hotel was there. I even took the car a couple of guests. You stayed? Well, it did not take long. Beth had the night off... and Joe left it ready the dinner for Ed. I came back because I did not want to leave him alone. Do not be sad with The dead girl? Sad? Romance for interest. A common creature of which every word, every breath... each gesture was the demonstration of an empty and superficial promise. MS. Morgan was the example of a homicide... completely justifiable! Is it an opinion or a confession, Ed? Confession? All these years I would have given whatever it is to use a knife... to recover the use of... a finger. Ed! Jess! Testing. Very clever. Now I think it's time to You go... Sheriff. - I'm sorry. "All right, Jess. I collect. Good night. Do not worry. Thank you, Julia. Did you find anything? Try the bridge. Nothing yet, Hib? More beer cans! Nothing that looks to a knife, Jess! Well, keep looking! One more time, folks. The doctor who suggested this should do your medical practice in an aquarium. Give it a try, Edmund, we do not we had tried this therapy. If this does not bother you, is one of the best... Yes, that bothers me! There is always hope. You must remember Mr. Parry. I've had enough. Get me out of here. Next time, put me on in plastic ducks... and make me push them with my nose! You just stayed half an hour and the doctor... I said I want to leave! You'd be so kind in help us, Mr. Hewson? Of course! Where's Joe? Why is not Joe here? All right, Mr. Parry, I've already paid. Wait here. Wait a moment. Lord Hewson! I want to talk to you! - Good morning Julia! - Good morning, Jess. Good morning Ed! I've been looking for you. I would like to make it some questions. I'm a man from few secrets, sheriff. Holmes,... My family helped to build this city... and I sweated blood so that this place would prosper I have obligation and responsibility about my guests. Now do not come with your methods cheap third-degree police. And drag everything into the mud. I had a date last night. with the murdered girl. You're spinning. David... Mr. Hewson was with me last night. I do not have to know what I know, Miss Dixon. He could have seen it before. It's true, I can. We had been by the pool drinking some drinks. She got a little drunk and began to act with a fool. I saw through the window. She was very excited... as if it were a coat of mink that I would like to prove. There are certain types of attitudes that can not be made publicly. Hers was one of them. I could meet her more Afternoon at Three Lakes. When the drunkenness passed... He would not act so lightly. I got angry and killed her. I'm going back to Miss Dixon and I'm taking her. to dance as if nothing happened. What's the best alibi I can have? than to discover the corpse? - Sounds convincing. "I knew you would." If I were the prosecutor, I could take a good case here. The only problem would be that I would lose. You will see that the meeting it was all Marcia's idea. I never showed up. Can you prove it? The law has two sides, Sheriff. The burden of proof is yours. Does Holmes prove anything? Do not push me too hard, Ed. He's worried, Jess. He did not mean it. Julia! Last night someone died and even a murder is an advertisement... too high for a city as small as ours. This is the first time I'm worried to have beautiful girls around. Maybe many things have to be tried before this is over. Are you Parry? They told me it was face in the wheelchair. I wanted to register. But the girl at the entrance told me which were full. Is right? It must be an error, number 29 is empty. Follow me please. Do you intend to stay Long time, sir...? Felton. Joseph Felton. A few days, maybe. Maybe more, maybe less. They should keep this material locked up, sheriff. It happens only a small murder like this and... bang... gives new life to the city. A reputation that has come from night to day. Bungalow 19. I will show you. Keep eating, do not worry by me. Do not sit down. You can bring me A cup of coffee, Sally? I thought about joining the girl. Ames and Mr. Grant. Last night they were to Three Lakes together? Well, not exactly. My agent brought this script for me. I had to read it immediately to tell him if he accepts the role. I joined Harriet later. Thank you, Sally. I do not see it... Thank you. I have not seen him in a long time. in a movie, Mr. Grant. An actor has to take care of the roles it plays. - You must watch... "You'll have to have them first, I guess." I remember, the other girl and I... we were at the door of your studio one afternoon... after school in the rain just to get Norman's autograph. You have a faithful admirer, Mr. Grant. Sometimes success happens very fast. As the night progresses come many Harriets. And many glasses that they rise to his head. Then many mistakes. And when they stop asking for autographs, is a forgotten man. But it will not always be so, Norman It will not be! - This paper they offer you... - Come to get in shape. To stop drinking. To bury my past. Finding Harriet helped me recover the faith he had lost. What is wrong with you and Marcia Morgan, Mr. Grant? What has that? - Do you know her? - Do I know her? I... Well, yes, I met her when was making this movie. Please, Sheriff, I can not help myself. see involved in this, not now! That would scare every producer of Hollywood. Are you sure this is the single reason for your concern? Very well, Joe, be careful. I'll come back later with you. By the way... You and that young woman, Louise Miles, Have you traveled together here? Do the two work in Los Angeles? That's right, We shared a room. She was at the telephone company. and I am a professional model. While here, stay near the facilities. Do not walk alone at night. Come on, Joe! What happened? We find him running like crazy in "Navvie Hogan". I was carrying this. Hold on. Bring him! They got him with it. It's from our kitchen. Joe, you killed a Woman with that? You did it? Kill a woman? I found a knife. I went to the mountains and killed a rabbit. I think I killed a rabbit. Maybe a woman. I got drunk. I hate women. Your woman. You're crazy! Lock him, Fred. Did you hold it? Take the knife to Dr. Aiken, I want to know if it's human blood. I'll go later. Joe goes crazy when he drinks. Imagine things. Has a mental gaps. When he saw Beth, he did not had no mental gap. Joe did not want to hurt. I used to help Julia take care of me. before Beth saw her work with us. He gets a little jealous when it has come, it is the human condition. He found the knife, I'm sure. Too bad if this ends with a Good solution, yes, sheriff? Shure. Like the man who sliced his wife in 32 pieces. He thought it was a pack of cards. Who said you did not find Marcia and you thought it was Beth? Maybe it makes less sober sense. We do not deal with a killer. committing a common crime. None of the usual reasons. No revenge, no money, nor self-defense. There is no forethought here. This killer is different. On the outside it is quiet, normal, perfectly adapted. But inside... in your mind, your thoughts boil. When they reach a certain intensity, the brain explodes. The madness escapes... And then it was over. The flame is extinguishing... and the fire goes out. Until next time. - MS. Miles. - Yes. I want to talk to you for a moment. Do you mind if I do? any questions? Do you mind coming to "Pink Poodle"? I'm going to change clothes Yes, but... You and Frankie Pierce... Is it a question or a statement? It depends on you. Past. As... Like Marcia Morgan. Which is? Let this be a lesson. Frankie left you. planted last night? Do not ask me, sheriff, Ask Frankie. Beth. You can answer the phone call, please? You saw if Ed was okay. When were you coming here? - Yeah. He's still in the pool. - Thank you. Hotel Parry. Julia called for the call to a Mr. Joseph Felton on... Very well. Verdie, you can go. Hello. Well, pass on. Hello? Hello, Mr. Prentiss? It's Felton. Yes, I'm in Kanab. A place in Utah. A great tourist center. I got here this morning. It is a city of about 1,200 inhabitants... Just now it's 1,199. One of them died in the Last night, a woman. Someone was nervous with a knife. Yes, do not worry, I'm at it. Maybe I'll find something. I would like to sniff a little before talking to the sheriff. Yes. I'll call him tomorrow morning. According. Bye. Mr. Felton. Oh, the great boss! Nice facilities It should have a slogan. "Stay with Parry." I'd like some cold tea, Mr. Felton. Thanks for asking. Start training for life Very early night, right? I traveled so much I forgot delay the clock. I'm still in the east, three hours in advance. Cocktail hour. I'm not who to change the Lord's time. Your conscience should worship him for it. Why are you here, Mr. Felton? Waiting for the next murder. Speech... Look... and it smells like a loose animal in the jungle of a city. And all the time could swear he would not show up. The same. Tonight we're going to get fat. Right, Frankie? Are you in mourning? - Put the drink and shut up. - Come on, Frankie. This is no way to talk. Yes... Cracked like a... You want to know. She was at the bar. She said. Mike, dear, never leave mine. ice melt in an empty glass. Then she left for that lane. dance and really armed. I told you to shut up. Mike, shut up! Do not be so sensitive, boy. Beer, Mike. That summer job What do you have in the sawmill? It's not the only thing in What do you do, Frankie? You have some very sharp horns. since you came to Kanab. Big, muscular guy. Yes, I think you can. have any girl. I think you could do she will fight for you... until it drives you crazy. You're connected to this girl from the hotel. That girl Louise Miles. I talked to her this afternoon. I mean, she said almost everything. I mean, that would be which she did not say. For example, how you planted it at the party, even being there. Since I was in second place ago of Marcia, all the time. It would be a great who had an encounter with Marcia, go find her and find her dead... How was she? Yes, I would have died of fear. See you, Mike. The law is sleeping late today. Working or playing? - Going home. - The last drink? Another time, thank you. Good night. Whatever you want. Two Scots, please. The ice just to cool and a lemon peel. How two people start how did we do and then they're so lost? So many things seem to have crossed on the road... Yes... And worst of all is that I I can not believe we stopped. Well, all right. Let's talk about ourselves. For us. That is much better. What about with this dance? What did I promise you? You know I'm weird? One of the last of a endangered species. Really? A single man. Not only that. Very busy. And these women. What's wrong with women? That sometimes they're like a cop... that there is never one at hand when you need it. No bitterness or mistrust? What do you trust? I'd like to trust you. Please, David, can we go? A terrible night for The lovers, eh, Jack? Look at that funny man. This is increasing, Jess. You will have to raise taxes to build a morgue. You sure you drowned? Your lungs are flooded... and there is no trace of violence nor physical damage. If you want an autopsy, will have to wait. No, let it be. We can leave it at your place, Ben. Without embalming or anything, until you know more about it. In any case, this does not much must be done with it. I was starting to have a good tan. Well, here are your personal belongings. I'm sorry, I could not examine Before the girl's knife, Jess. I had my hands busy with two babies until this morning. All right, doc. There are no rules for anything. Can not set the time of birth nor that of death. We will not see it later. Yes. I'd like a cigarette. No, one of mine. Extra long. They last longer. We must learn to live I really can. Sometimes it takes time. No, no, in the mouthpiece. You will have to swallow. Who do you think could Have you done that, Hewson? Well, Holmes has a long list. We are all in this. You are a lawyer. Watch your reaction, studying faces, probing... What are you, lawyer? of the accusation... or defense lawyer? If I were on trial. What would you like it to be? Yes, I told you once. No, no, no, no one has been arrested yet. Yes, we have many assistants. They're patrolling the whole town. No, we will not let children at night. Yes, we do what we can to protect our women. Maybe I have more to say. but that's how much I'm going to say. Yes of course. Call me whenever you want. I don't care. Verdan... If any more journalists from Los Angeles or Salt Lake asked for me... Do you have problems to find me, understood? Yes thanks. - Then? "He did not eat anything. He almost fainted when he saw me eating. Boss, many hammers In my head. Making a big noise. Keep drinking this and this. will make a hole in your head. Now you listen to me, Joe. Try to think. What would you refer to? The strange shape you saw... before you find the knife? Was it something different? Do not know. Animal maybe. I think. So I went to kill the rabbit with a knife. That knife had human blood, Joe. You did not kill rabbits. You did not kill anything. You were drinking until you You started to see things... in the Peaches bar while They killed the girl. But you could have seen something later. Joe? Maybe... maybe you can give me a drink. and I get drunk again. Maybe remember what I forgot. when I got drunk last night. Maybe you stay here until that you have any sense. The only thing that you will have. The water makes me very sick. Who was this guy who Felton called Pittsburgh? Harry Prentiss. Do you want the number? It's 04875. 04875. Thank you. E Verda. no matter what time of day or at night. If you receive a call from the police of Pittsburgh. Find me, okay? And... Really, not listening, right? There is not a moment of boredom Huh, sheriff? Can I do something for you? I'm sorry, I forgot that I'm still being a suspect. Hot or cold? Sit down. A good speech yesterday. I think it's a very smart lawyer. Maybe you're looking for a client to defend? Thank you. I came here to escape from it. Someone will need a good lawyer. Joe? I think maybe I can to disperse with you. Thank you. Sometimes, being the law, causes we feel very alone. Maybe I want to have someone to talk. Maybe it's human later. of everything, sheriff. It was not Joe, but he believes who saw something. I have it here because I do not want to that remember something being free... and get drunk and forget. That Felton... I never would have imagined it. as a private detective. So that was it. Too bad he could not swim. It would not have helped. Tell me about Parry, Sheriff. What happened to you? There were many stories. Each one counts in a different way. The most told It's about a girl. Go back 10 or 12 years ago. Not here. Somewhere in the east. I think they are They married and something happened. So she went out with another guy... and left Parry with an arrow broken heart. It is not a very different story, but Parry, he's a man very different. When you went to move your hands the next morning, He could not lift a finger. He has been like this ever since. He went to all the doctors. They could not do anything for him. I'm not a psychiatrist, but who knows? The blow to lose it may have been too strong. I could try to convert this on an exhaust valve... a way to punish yourself for not being able to keep it... have it for him. Your way of burying the pain and the shame of their pride. I do not know that, but I know you have a vein when dealing with women. Maybe not with Julia. It has been everything to him, except a wife. What happens if another woman get into your life? And get him out of his sister? I think it would be the man but lament in this world... if I had to prove what are you thinking. You and Julia grew up together, right? Fred! You better get out! I'm sorry. I did not intend to come in personally. Okay, if you need me, I'll be in Fredonia at the sawmill. Thank you. I'm going to see Frankie. I have a hunch that he saw the girl that night. He found her dead. Since then he has been speechless, I think if you tell us, We'd believe he killed her. The doctor says that there was no sexual violence. Frankie... Boy, you do not know how lucky he is. Do you want a ride? Thank you, I have one. if that's mine to think about. I started to ask myself questions. about us... and last night. Actually, I came here to consult my lawyer. To find out what he had to say. I got this message for you. Possible to delay viewing from Gray to Gray. It is urgent that you return. And take the time to prepare the case. Douglas. Julia thought that you could have come here. He thought you might need this as soon as possible. I hate goodbyes. I did not see it that way last night. I thought that was it that you tried to say. It was nothing like that. David... Not? What then? David, why do not you go? Because maybe i do not Wanna go without you. Maybe I thought About what I said... be the last of a kind in extinction. I do not want to die like this anymore. David! Very well, Beth. I knew I would have to tell you sooner or later, It's just that I did not know which words to use. David, I was already married. I was very young, very immature and very inexperienced. Things happened that made me feel a terrible shame. I was very unhappy, I had to leave it. I later felt that our relationship... I could not get married with another man. I had to run away. I went from one place to another. Finally, Mr. Parry gave me this job. I began to think more clearly, and then you appeared. And then I showed up. David, I'm sorry. I feel it, too. I'm just sorry, I do not have appeared before. Before they hurt you. COMPANHIA MADEIREIRA KAIBAB ONLY BY WHOLESALE. Frankie, be careful! Poor Frankie. A big scared man. Well, that's delicious. A sad and somber dinner now converted into an animated scene. I'm going to drink for Frankie. A burning and bright flame... in a cold and dark world. I will miss it. I will also miss the agitation of women. That, like butterflies, tried to fly through this flame. A pity that the flame It went off so fast. Because? Poor scorched butterfly. My drink, Julia. Delicious. - Come on! - Nobody drinks? This is not at all warm or fraternal. In addition, while Sheriff solves problems, we should live dangerously... before the murderer has destroyed and involved all. I'm going to have another drink, Julia. I'm having a lot of fun. Do you know anything? If we had not come here. I would never have so much fun. Is not that right, Louise? And because I'm having fun. I want to thank you for I had so much fun I want to thank you for I had so much fun Thanks for me so much fun He has lipstick here! - Let me... - I'll do it, thank you! Excuse me, I did not want to bother him. I just wanted to thank you for having so much fun. I think Mr. Parry understood. Harriet, come on. Come on. - I just wanted to say thank you. - Come on. Ambitious and primitive. There is no more art or cunning than a prehistoric animal chasing another. Well, it was a good party. A comfort. In the nature plan for the survival of the fittest, creatures like that will be sometime extinct, like the dinosaurs. Well, with that happy note I say good night. And thank you. I'm going to change my dress. I'll be right back. You saw the look on the face. of Parry when she kissed him? I thought Julia cut his throat. It's funny how it escaped me. A cigarette? I forgot you did not smoke. It's a mess, right? I'm going to see Holmes... to see if he has any news about this Felton. It seems that he thinks that Felton is involved in all this. Do you know, Holmes can be slow, but it has a lot of head. Is that you... - See you tomorrow. - David. Go ahead, say, I'm an idiot. I do not even know how to give a good Night for a girl? Do not change. You're going to love living in Los Angeles. A prevention to protect our wonderful night. Wonderful night... Beth will be back in a moment. Do you mind if she takes you home? I have headache. No, that does not matter. I bring you warm milk. before leaving? Milk? I'd like to get drunk... and then look in the mirror and spit in my face. How about a drink? A small reward for being my nanny. I'm sure to be alone. with me it would not cause any... concern with his Mr. Hewson. I always knew that some Someone would get you out of here. Must be tired. Yes, I'm tired. I'm tired of being surrounded of lipstick, love and... of the woman's flesh becoming jelly when you see a man... of men who howl street cats. When they see the leg of a woman and a black sock. I do not care if you accompanied with this drink or not... but you can serve me a long dose of whiskey. It falls perfectly into a long glass. There is not much hope for me, right? I think I understood. I think I understand how did you feel this night? when Harriet surrounded him with his arms and kissed him. I also think I understand how She felt when Marcia did not... tried to make him want to. I think I understand how do you feel. Look at these hands. Completely dead... when should they be able hug a woman feel the softness... of your skin,... to touch her hair your eyes,... your lips... What makes you so different? of the others? I'd better go. Can I do something else? For you before you go? Just leave me here. Well, good night. Good night. Since I met you, I did not nothing more than being for you. No, that's not the right word. It is deeper than that, much deeper I saw things in his eyes. Desire, passion and infinite tenderness... of which not even you know. If you give me a chance, I'd know how to get these things out of your eyes... and your emotions and feelings... If you gave me a chance... I love to rehearse with you, Norman. So Norman takes Diana in his arms and this time he kisses her. Norman, it was beautiful...! Amos, out. He died in the last half hour. Blood still comes out of some wounds. Sounds like the same killer. The cut at the neck is the same. And those arms. Cut out like a puzzle. These mutilations are beginning. Tell a story, Jess. I am a general practitioner, but everyone we studied some psychology. I do not have to be crazy to know I have a madman in my hands. I'm starting to think that this character... will do this with anyone who throw yourself into the arms of a man. Yes. Yes, Jess, you have to find someone like that. - Holmes, I... - After. We were here. We were sitting right here. I was... kissing her. Then something hit me in the head. I lost consciousness. When I recovered, was beside her. We were covered in blood! Grant, try telling me... Did you see who it was? Did you see anything? We were sitting here. I was sitting next to her. Then something hit me in the and I lost consciousness. When I recovered, How was it... He is sick, he should be at the hospital. I was sitting next to her. That blow to the head. Is there any chance of that he himself did it? I do not believe. I finished with this. Well, I have another one for you, Ben. Cover and get out of here. One of these days I would like to have to marry someone. Holmes, at tonight's party... Holmes, come with me. to Parry's house? Amos, I'm sure you It will still blind someone to it. I'm sorry. I thought It was Ben coming out with the corpse. Holmes, I'm trying to tell you. Harriet got drunk. Embraced Parry... You will not have to worry The more she does it again. Do they already know? Yeah, I told them to call them. I did not like it, he said. I did not see Beth. See you later. Julia. Is that you? What are you? doing in my house? Parry, I need to talk to you. Maybe I have a different idea. about my..., physical disability. Julia! Julia! Is not here. I checked the whole house. Harriet is dead, Parry. With the neck cut off, like Marcia. Today I saw how she approached of you, and hugged him, I kissed him. Maybe it was the champagne. But I also saw how Marcia acted. She had no limit with men. You... you were money. A word she could spell. Money can change opinion of a girl about things. Now both are dead. A sister's love can be as possessive and jealous as the... a mother to the child when a woman stands between them. I feel like I have to say it. I feel it, too. Because she would not be able to to try anything. I'll provide an alibi. where it is needed. What benefit will it make if you do it? You will have to live with this. the rest of your life. I stopped living with myself more than 10 years ago. Since then I have been dead inside. Murdered. Killed by my own sister when she destroyed The only love I've ever had. She will not believe it, but I have forgiven her. Did I forgive you? How charitable! What about Marcia Morgan and Harriet Ames? What about the next woman Think that will get you? What's going to happen to her, Parry? Will you continue to forgive? If you forgive again and you will be so guilty. of murder as if wielding... a gun and blow my head to keep me out of this room. Good, I do not have a gun. You and I both know why. she did it, Hewson. Make sure that they you understand, right? David, it was awful. I took Mr. Parry home. and I was going back to my room... when the output from Grant's bungalow. That was before I knew what happened. He followed me into my room. with that in your hand. She made me drive her car. It's ok. It's ok. We got here. I ran away. She hit me with this knife in your hand. I tried to take it off, but... But but... David... help me. Help me! It's going to be OK. You have to take her to the hospital. David... Do not let them take me. Please do not let that they take me. Please do not let that they take me. Do not let them take me, please. Now everything will be all right, my dear. You can not help it. Do not. No, she could not help it. Thank you David. David, you'd better start forgetting. Of course, Jess, I'll start forgetting. Why did not I see you like you? It was not me. It was the call of Felton to Prentiss, Beth's husband. Prentiss hired him to take Beth home. I found his trail. and I was following him... when he heard of murder of Marcia Morgan. He recognized the signs, so he stayed. The only thing is that he did not know whom to look for. The photos did not tell him anything. She changed her name and hair color. It could have been any of the girls from the village or hotel. It could look so sweet and fresh. like apple pie, - if it were not known. - Sheriff. I was going and... Well, I'm going. to fix everything about Harriet. I feel things have ended thus.
