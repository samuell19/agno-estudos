Gotcha. Couldn't be any happier. Been waiting 25, 30 years to get in this. Now we're gonna get it, finally. I know we are. Last week I couldn't even walk that far. You know? Can't keep a treasure hunter down. According to Rick Gwynne, there was a cave of gold. He was getting ready to start bringing some stuff out. When he went back, a miner had filed a claim on the land and every time that Rick went there, the miner and his buddies were getting drunk and they'd start shooting at him. So, if he went near the place, he'd get killed. After 25 years, this guy got off the land and so Rick's trying to recover it. And so that's why he called me. We'll scan that and put it on the laptop. - Well, I... - Does that sound okay or do you want to have us scan a different spot? - I mean, that's... - No, you... - you know where the... - I'm thinking that's where... Your machine says that it's... Well, I'm saying that when I scanned it last time I was in that bottom corner over there. When I got in the cave, the amazement that I had was just unbelievable. There was some blunderbusses, there were some paintings, and there was a cask of coins, and then next it a little ways was a pile of jewels. This one jewel, it was on a rug and it was huge. There's also the skeletons of the people that must have put it in there. With all the DNA things that they have nowadays, we can find out whose family they belong to and finally set them to rest. There's a table across from them with a... with a skeleton and the gentleman also had his arm near a book, which I believe this book would have secrets in it that are just unbelievable. There's another room and there's also a skeleton there. There were some stacks of bars, they were silver and they were gold, maybe a foot and a half off of the ground. You tell someone that, you know, that you seen this stuff and you've got all this stuff if they think, why aren't you a millionaire? It was just too dangerous and we had these terrible rainstorms that came in and it just filled in the washes here. We could not find another entrance. Dad likes to kind of think of himself as Indiana Jones, which is kind of cool, you know, and it's true because he's just out there and finding all the information out, reporting it. His reward is the adventure and the journey and everything that comes with that. I'm following his example. Y-you need to bring your stuff out. Okay? All... all right... Robert had told Rick that I was the attorney on the expedition in the Superstition and Rick wanted to ask me a few quick questions. Well, I... I... I brought you a retainer agreement - if you want to sign it. - What it... can you tell us - what it means? - Well, it just means Ri... he's retaining me as his attorney. That's all. So, so, if I have to go to the government, if I have to, you know, do anything... do anything on his behalf. - Just so... - At this... at this very moment, I'm not planning on going to those guys. - Okay. All right. Well... - Right off the bat. - Yeah, I got you. Okay. - Yeah. 'Cause they're just too greedy. Well, I... I, you know, it'd be coming to me as an attorney, I have to tell you, you know, legally, you know, the correct course and then it's up to you whatever you want to do, but, you know, be remiss if I didn't, so. - Uh-huh, remiss, yeah. - Yeah. Okay. Gonna have to put in 10 feet. Put 10 feet. I don't see the targets. I can't get can't get... can't get below something in the rock. - I don't know what's happened. - What happened? I can't know what's happened. I mean we used to have a room and we used to have a billion marks and now we got nothing but... a rock layer that's only a foot deep. All the ground that we just scanned, I can't see anything below two feet. Really? You got to remember that the heat affects my instrumentation. And I had... and I wanted to be done by 10 o'clock for a reason. And we're out here almost at 12 and it's 97 degrees. And I'm thinking that the Rover may not be operating well enough because of the damn temperature. Technology didn't work for us today. Well, it certainly showed up on our last scan exactly where... where everything should be, it was. On... according to your... your screen. I... I'm thinking you're just going to have to drill, drill long and take your best shots. Well, you're going to try some of your drilling, I hope, at least. I want to see that dad-burned drill you was running. I don't have one. Bill brought... brought to what he's got and you've got what you've got and I've got nothing. I'm doing scanning. Over there I found where the paintings were. When I came over here, I scanned across these rocks just about here... was a rectangular golden blob. - That'll work. - Okay. - Anywhere in here. All right? - Okay, I'll get started. - Okay? - Yup. Is that your wife's vacuum? Well, yeah, but she doesn't know I got it. It looks to be an inch, but I know that one that I had from Harbor Freight said an inch. And this is bigger. So I don't know, huh? Maybe they have smaller inches at Harbor Freight. Yeah, okay, lemme... I... step aside and I'll do it right now. Put your hand right here. You don't want to get a hand here - and then have it twist. - Gotcha. - So that's why I'm... - Gotcha. Try it. Trying to find the bigger stuff clog it up. Okay, stop. I pushed little too far, probably. Could be stuck, you know. Stuck in there. It's stuck in there. We proved the point that this will go down at least two feet. The numbers that we got through the software provided by the manufacturer, don't add up to the reality. I didn't write the software. I didn't design the tool. The equipment's here... take your best guess. Don't go home saying, "I wish I could have tried." Everybody's just kind of feeling the anxiety, hoping that we just, you know, make a breakthrough at some point, you know. I'm sure... seems... it just seems to be all a matter of, I mean, you can feel the ground shaking. You know, like something hollow. We're gonna go ahead and drop the camera all the way down in there, take pictures of whatever's... whatever... whether everything's down in there, actually. I always knew it'd still be here, no matter what. And now it might be coming into fruition. Salvador started the Victory Club 25 years ago tonight. He, uh, asked me if I would take it over for 12 years, and so I said, "Sure." I felt like it was a great honor to do that. And so, I started passing out the Treasure Hunter of the Year Award, which is given to someone that... that keeps the lore going and represents us in a good way. Now, this year, Salvador and I are gonna turn it over to, uh, Bob Schoose and Wayne Tuttle. - There you go, buddy. - Thank you, guys. Yes, ma'am, all right. For this year, Treasure Hunter's 25th Annual Awards Presentation, "To a true mountain man and treasure hunter: A special thanks for keeping the legend alive for many years, hiking in the Superstition ranges, searching out the many stories, lost mines, and keeping the secrets of the treasures they've held. A true legend of the mountains. You will be remembered by us all forever and always." So, it looks like that the, uh, silver basin filled with coins and jewels is still there. He's got all those orange targets, it's over here, where the... the table and all that stuff was, and you can see where I think that basin was, right there, that little yellow hit? - Okay. - Right, and there's, uh, maybe some other spots that I might hit, but we're getting solid targets. I have lived 51 years researching this mine. Lookin' for gold and such as that for 31 years. - 35 years since I come here. - This is like my rookie year. I personally have found things in the Superstition Mountains, yes. We found three silver bars up... up in the rafters. There's a number of people that have found gold bars in or around the Superstition Mountains. Uh, gold seekers, we call 'em "true believers." They're a... they're a different breed, and they come in all shapes and sizes, and, uh, they... they just... they... they have this... It's this drive. It's like that carrot out in front of you, dangling in front of you. "I know it's out there, I know I can find it. I just wanna find it.‚Äù The gold seeker trained in science is going to be more professional, because that's more of your scientific process. You don't just take it at face value. You have to prove it. This is a scan, and it lets you see the 3D images that have been produced. The dark blue indicates an area that's been disturbed by digging. The blue-grey and the green, this indicates the terrain that's been set down by natural geology. And then, this is a corroded target. The orange is the corrosion that coats the target, and this side view shows you that the target is below everything else, which indicates it's a real target and not a false alarm. What I discovered was the location of the Latin Heart site. I discovered how to read the Latin Heart Map that was made from a clay tile. It has 31 caches. 31 Roman numerals. It's my opinion that the Roman numerals represented bars of gold, so when I scanned and I saw bar shapes, I made the conclusion I would be looking for bars. I collated all my results, I made a master map, I showed where everything was, I got everything prepped. I briefed Gary Hanna, head Tonto National Forest Ranger. I said, "I'm willing to hand you all my notes, all my records, stand back, and say, 'It was here, ' and watch you guys do it all." I thought, when I went to Gary and I gave him minimum of four years of work, research, measurable data, given that I've got three degrees and that I know my field of expertise, I honestly hoped I was gonna get, "Wow! That's great!" And boy, was I naive. They threw it away. Totally opposite reaction what... I just was totally dumbfounded. Usually people think I have the gold, think I'm nuts, or I'm gonna get killed. Those are the three responses I usually get. I only had one choice: To raise my army. The army of the greedy. Okay, so I got Bill, James, David, Nathan, and myself. Thank you, guys, for joining me. - Jason, what'd I say? - Nathan. Wrong brother, I'm tired. The trail that we're taking is the Massacre Trail of 1862. It completely matches what Jacob Waltz said on his deathbed. This is the treasure site that's on the Latin Heart Map. Everything that I've found at Latin matches it. I was just surfing on the internet one day, and I typed in "Lost Dutchman Goldmine" just to see what the next story was. Here's Robert Kesselring's five-part summary of what he'd been working on for six years. He says, "I'm looking for an attorney to do some pro bono work for me to see if we can get some digging permits, and get things going on this. I stopped right there, and I emailed back, I go, "I'm your guy, I am in this 1,000 percent. Don't have to look any farther." The other people on the team... my next-door neighbor, James Sybesma. His passion has always been gold. How... how treacherous is... do you think it is? I told him right away, I says, "Count me in." People have been lookin' for the Lost Dutchman Mine too long and they haven't found it. Kess is like, "Nah! There really is a Lost Dutchman Mine, and there really was a guy.‚Äù David Smith I grew up with in Palm Springs, and David is a rock hound. Bill was talking about this guy's story. He knows exactly what the Lost Dutchman's Gold Mine is all about, I mean he... he carried on, and carried on, and carried on, and all I knew was that I wanted to see the Superstition Mountains and hang out for a while. We're 65 years old, I mean, we're not far from... behind Kess. That foundation is... I think between the two of 'em, we're pretty well set with our support staff. The map says there's 31 caches of gold, and totaling over 31,000 gold bars. If you do the math, the value today is $6 billion worth of gold bars out there. So, the whole idea here is: You gotta show the government proof. And what's proof? Well, proof is holding up that gold bar, dropping it off on the desk of the... the forest ranger, and say, "This is out there." This is an Indiana Jones adventure, I'm telling you! You're looking at Superstition Mountain, a barbaric pile of rock 40 miles long by 20 wide. The man is Floyd Buckley. He's going into this 800-square miles of sudden and violent death, because he thinks it's just another mountain, and because he's greedy for its treasure. Yeah, I said treasure... gold. $20 million worth of precious yellow metal waiting to be found in America's most elusive mine, appropriately named The Lost Dutchman. You see, this is the true story of Superstition Mountain, the biography of a death trap! My name's Barry Storm. I was hurled into this story when I heard that shot. Up till then, I was just an ordinary guy with a reasonable curiosity about the Lost Dutchman Mine. When I was 13, my Aunt Ruth gave me a copy of Thunder Gods Gold, written by Barry Storm. My aunt met Barry Storm, who's here, and had him sign it for her. It was about more than just looking for gold. It was about treasure hunting, and it was the legends of the Jesuits, the Peraltas, and the Lost Dutchman. This book I read religiously, most of my life, right next to the Bible. Bible, Thunder Gods Gold. Back and forth, back and forth, and that's how I got into the depths of where I am now about treasure hunting, and I am totally in love with the people that went through that experience. When I'm... when I'm there, my heart and my soul is with them. I see their impact, I see where they slept, I see where they died. I see the plants that are native that they grew that were herbs for food. I see all the little secret symbols that they've put up, hidden triangles and stuff. I can... I can see the ghosts of ancient past walkin' around. It's like a... a head trip Disney can't provide, you know? And so, I went back to one of the pictures, and in it was a petroglyph map, and I looked at it, and I look at it, that's when I realized what he knew, that the Mexicans used the metric system. Everybody before me, for a hundred years kept saying, "They're Spanish. They use leagues, They use varras. They didn't understand science." They had the highest developed mining university at the time in Mexico City, and the Germans would take their graduate students and send them there to learn more and go into the field. Hi, poochie. Dad basically had just given me copies of the books, and was telling me about the Peralta Maps, and all that kind of stuff. He was seeing that I had interest. He just kinda started saying, you know, "Hey, if you wanted to go out and kinda, you know, get your camping skills sharpened up, I can help you, and... 'cause I wanna take this big trip.‚Äù Yeah, we'll leave it in the bedroom. I like it, though. Yeah, it was your grandpa's, he liked it a lot. My parents were divorced when I was like two years old. I was like 12 when, uh, Dad was able to kinda come back into my life briefly. - Yeah, yeah. - And then, after high school, I was 19, I left Texas, and then pretty much didn't have any real communication for 20 years. Probably been about 32 years total of my life that I didn't have my father. My intention is to hand off everything that I've learned. Give my son Jason all the training he needs. "This is my legacy to you. This is my work, I hand it to you, you carry it on.‚Äù I cherish everything that we get to do from, you know, this point on. Just kinda, like, "All right, well, you know, if you need somebody to kinda be there for ya, and you know, recording and doing whatever." I said, ‚ÄúI'll do that.‚Äù Everything out here'll bite ya, poke ya, prick ya, sting ya, or poison ya. The Superstitions can be real dangerous, especially if you don't know what you're doin'. I was out there walkin' around Yellow Peak, they call it, and off to my right, I couldn't believe it, I saw what I knew was a skeleton. There was one of the fellas there, and, uh, he had his arm on the backpack, and then I looked down the canyon, uh... down the canyon a little ways, and there was another fella layin' there. They said that they died of natural causes, but the one fella looked like he had a couple of indentations in the back of his head. Somethin' blunt, and the other fella, it looked like his back had been beat in, and one rib bone was stickin' out through the front, and, uh, but his shirt was not torn, so no animal reached in there and pulled those bones from the back forward. They were layin' on this black basalt rock, and that... in July? That must've been just terribly, terribly hot. We went out there and asked the Sheriff's Department if we could help look for the guys, and they told us that we better go take a special course, so that they didn't have to worry about us gettin' lost. Hundreds of people have died in the Superstition Mountains. This is my last expedition into the Superstitions to document the things that I have discovered, a project that takes a whole lot more people than one person. We had the Mexican-American War in 1846, and they had been hoarding their gold and building it up, and they were gonna secede from Mexico. So, I believe 31 families that were the wealthiest families in the district saw the Americans coming, told their sons to take the treasure out to where the hoard was, and they buried the family's wealth, 'cause they couldn't get it to Mexico fast enough. That's the treasure that I've located. I'm pretty certain that, uh, you know, we're gonna... we're gonna find something out there. This is real. There's a lot of gold out there. Howdy, am I far enough off? - Well... - You want me to back up? He's a big horse, but I think you'll be okay. I'm all right. Looks like you've been working hard, guys. When you see people comin' through with packs, presumably these guys struck it rich, and they're working the Dutchman's Vein. That's the kind of rumor mill that keeps churning all the interest in the gold and the Superstitions. Six hours of hiking. About a mile an hour. Rover made it. This is a scanner. It looks shorter than the... - Oh, it's... - It's collapsed. Collapsed. I'm acting like I've never put up a tent before in my life. Got another three-and-a-half-mile hike tomorrow. Good night, see you in the morning, or if something crazy happens in between, I will let you know. A cement bag's just a-droopin' on down. Well, that cement's there it's a-there for a weight, babe. Five'll get ya ten, old Macky's back in town. Yeah, yeah, oh, the line forms. Macky's back in town. So, today's goal is to, uh, take you to the notch of the heart, okay? And then, we're gonna climb up the mesa, and we'll get to the Citadel. I'm going to break up the teams. I'll have shown you where the last place was I saw a prospect, and it's under a fire pit. - Yeah. - And I'm gonna take Nathan and I'm gonna teach him how to do the rover. Who? Jason. - Jason. - There ya go. Is your bag too heavy, is it good? - It's okay. - Right. Love you, Dad. Okay, GPS on. The day came...'cause I was... I was gettin' gold fever, and I went, "You know what? Don't quit your day job, James. You got two kids to raise, and a hot wife to keep happy. I think you better save that for retirement." Doin' this, it's right out of my wildest dreams - for my retirement. - Hey, dreams! Fairy Tales coming true. It's like chasin' the dragon. What are you waiting for, Billy? - Good save. - Thank you. Would you like your cell phone back? Yeah. - I got it. - Okay. Be careful comin' down. We're in the Citadel, gentlemen. You are in the Peralta Map Latin Heart area. I found a series of targets, and I said, "Well, let's dig a latrine over one of them." Got done, and we filled it back in, and we built a fireplace. He says that's it. See it, see where we walked? - Yeah. - It's in the right spot. I think you should scan. That's my start. Bush is my last, right this side. I'm linked. There's no hits. I'm not seein' a prospect. Now, what I can do is when I get back to camp, I can put this on the laptop and check it, but I don't have any targets in there today. We can start to... maybe you'll get a... James, you wanna... you wanna auger this down a little bit? There's a rock down there about little bit bigger than a soccer ball. If you go down three feet to that rock and I scan it, I should get a hard target. Point this out. Efficient operation. When I say, "Scoop," you can start scooping. Hold on. Panic is settin' in, guys. - Time to go. - All right, he's gotta scan it - one more time. - It's time to pull out. He... what... I don't understand why he's not gonna scan this one more time. You just drop the pole down in there. - Two minutes. - Yeah. Okay, you guys wanna... you guys wanna push that envelope, you can talk to the main man, but... - Yeah. - He's tired and... - All right. - It's his time for his, you know, meds and whatnots. If this was me, I'd be goin'. - Yeah. - "Nobody eats until we get the gold. So, tonight is: Get to bed early, get your rest, take two vitamins, say no to sex. You know, the Olympic thing. I don't have to at our age. We're in that... we're in that club where all the girls say, "I don't wanna, and..." Yeah, I gotta be reminded of that. Yeah, you're not in my league. So, now, the whole idea of coming here was to find a target, and to show that all of the research and everything you've done, is worth it and we find the... you know, we... we find a bar and whatever it is. That's the number one goal on this trip is to find a target. We just got off to a late... too late of a start today. So, we're up at 7:30, and gettin' dressed, and goin' and havin' breakfast. All right, so it's about 8:00 at night. Went out to target one, and it's just, uh, with the equipment, seems like it just was still reading air. We'll go back tomorrow and finish it out. Good morning, Gordy, how you doin'? Good morning, good to see you, too. After the hike of a mile and a half, I'm convinced I can't hack going back to the Latin Heart site. I've had four operations since I was here last. It took its toll. Now, I talked with Jason, and I said, "Hey, if there's a spare tent left over down here for me, I'm good to stay." So I've given you the coordinates, I've given you the aerial surveys, and I think you guys all need to get up there. I wish that I had prior knowledge to all of this, you know? No... he... I mean, I... I just listen to him, you know? I gotta tell you, that guy is... He has very interesting, convincing stories. He knows what the hell he's talking about. I am... well, I am not having any doubt in my mind. The kid... the kid is just... I mean, he's... he's got dreams of getting the kid all involved, and I don't see it, do you? No. They were... the... you know, the Peraltas were like - the Rockefellers for... - Yeah. - You know, the King of Spain? - Nah, but very interesting. - Yeah. - To do all the mining. I was for... for weeks, I was trying to think of what Peralta, I was like, "Is that an Indian?" I never heard an Indian group named that. - Yeah, well... - I just couldn't think - of what that was. - What did they do, did they get a Spanish land grant here, or something? Yeah, they did, and the guy, the head Peralta guy, I forget his name, Manuel Peralta I believe, he was the largest, uh, landowner in the state of California. So, a lot of people in the history books don't know about these Peralta miners that were massacred... 86 of 'em in 1847... by the Apaches. Billy boy. 10 bucks, are we gonna see anything or what? - Yeah, we are. - Yeah? Fuckin' A. Very unstable. Very loose. I see the tarp. And I brought twice the digging tools. So, we're gonna go four times faster and deeper. I'll be right back. I'm not trying to get out of work. - Oh, yeah. - No, I'm not. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Obviously, I think someone was just diggin' down to see if there was some kind of vein. 'Course, who knows? Anyway, we'll just have to wait till Robert gets here. You know, Kess, he's 67, 68, uh, so he... It's been a hard trip for him. So, he's following up the rear today, taking it a little bit slower. So, David and James are over there hard at it to get us down another foot and a half, so we can run the scanner over it, uh, or I've got my, uh, metal detector. And if for some reason there's... there isn't anything there, then we're going over this hill here to target number two, and, uh, let's see what we can, uh... see if we can, uh, bring up the target on, um, Robert's scanner. Well, that's where I'm leading to, is in another two months is kinda the goal. I know it sounds stupid, two months or next week... That's what I'm saying is you pick a goal, put your mind to it, I just haven't put my mind to it yet. I have a mental image of that shit. Hey, David. James. How's it going? - We're waiting on you, Bill. - Okay. We got the rock out. You got the rock up? - What? - You found the volleyball rock? - Yeah. - Get out of here. - We're waiting on you, Bill. - Oh, okay. I thought you would've set off a flare or something. Find my way down. Robert, we're waiting for you, you have honors. There were other rocks that we found on the way down there to it, but this was the big one, - right smack in the middle. - I'll scan it for you. Now, Robert, there's another fire pit right here. Just kind of in the open. Well, I'm just sayin', I don't know how long it takes, but this... you know, this could be a fire pit right here, and... This looks like a big, uh... bigger one. - Look at it, it's not here. - Well, I'm just saying, it's in line with this, I just, you know... No, no, but I'm sayin' that what... what you're lookin' at is not just that, it's this here. Yeah. - I see a fire pit. - Got the laptop? Got the cables? - Yes. - Bring 'em up. I just don't wanna leave this area without trying to... You should see pretty much what we were seeing. And you'll notice that there's no target in there. Well, this is right in line, look at it. - By... by... - Do you know what I'm sayin'? Yeah. There's nothing there in the center. But, you can see where I'm saying that target used to be, and the ground all around it was dug up. So, I don't think they're gonna find anything. I think it's been dug out, or they've moved my fireplace. - So, Bill. - Yeah? I don't have anything on there. So, either they moved the fireplace or they took it. You wanna look at this, Robert? - That's a fire pit, too. - That's not ours. That's not yours, okay, okay. Since time's fleeting, why don't you go to target two? - Gettin' my strength. - Okay. Even this... look at it, Bill, even this is... I'm... I'm... you know, you can see 'em everywhere. That... that could be a spot, that could be a spot. And they're really close to the general area. And to be so fixated on... Yeah, yeah. I want you to come up here and look at what we just found. You won't fricking believe this. - Is that paper? - It's a tarp. They stuffed it with something to hide it. How deep did they go? - Look at this shit! - Am I wrong? Good lord. - Look at this! - Leave it for prints. - Yeah. - Well, I got my gloves on. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - We got... - Are those empty? - No, they're full! We've got Campbell's soup, pea with bacon. Progresso loaded potato and bacon. Bean and bacon. These guys loved bacon! Unbelievable! They opened up an abandoned mine from the Mexican Peralta's. - Well, I wouldn't. - Yeah, could of. You're not gonna dig like that to hide tools! - That... - No, no, they didn't do that. That's... that's for sure. They opened up a shaft that'd been sealed. And they... they broke in. Okay, well, uh, leave the tarp in the hole so it's safe. The mine was already going. It had been built way back when. This mine was already... had already been started. Now, the mine... you're saying mine? - Yeah, mine. - Were they looking for gold in here? The original guy who dug in here? - Yes, why would he do that? - Of course they were gold miners, this point I'm ready to call the FBI and say there's been gold stolen on federal land. That looks like explosives to me. I don't know anything about explosives. - I... I wouldn't touch it. - Well no, I'm not touching it. Well if it's fulminated mercury, it could go off in your hand. Nice little PVC pipe bomb. Ah, shit! This is unreal, this is un-fricking-believable. What is that? A backpack? Well that's fricking unbelievable! Look at that! - That's gutsy. - Well... well. Well, we'll look at the contents. There's a Red Bull can here. Don't touch it, there might be prints the sheriffs can get. - You okay? - Yup. I'm just staggering down. - You got it? - That's brand new! We got a name! Yeah, here's L.A. Swat when you need them? Right, they're catching stuff! This is unreal, this is un-fricking-believable. Okay, doing the Vietnam check here. A phone number! - Is that a score? - Oh, that's a score! Oh, damn. Oh, baby. But holy... That's a... That's it. We flushed them. They ran out of here like... ran out of here like illegals. - This is damp. - Okay. Another bottle. Don't wanna handle that. - Foil. - Tinfoil. Uh, space blanket? Oh, I think we can connect him with the explosives. What's in there? - Don't play too much. - Oh. We got matches, cannon fuse. Thermite igniter, two pack. You got bomb making equipment out here. This is FBI evidence. We're good at finding tools, and we're good at finding backpacks. Somebody's moved a butt load of dirt over here. Just recently. Looks like 80 percent of the material is gone. This used to be up there, and right here was a stone monument about that high. It's gone. The history's gone. The shit's trashed. Bomb went off out up here. I told the Feds, I said, "If... if we go get a bar, and we find it's a bar then the cache here was... would be worth today a billion dollars." Those guys left those tools because they're coming back because they didn't get down far enough. You saw those guys coming out of here with all those horses with the crates? Fuck! I'm gonna bet they took out whatever they found. Pretty clear that the plunderers have been out here. Government wouldn't listen to me. They're probably gonna say, "Well, you're the one that released the information." I said, "I told you I would." All right. Visions of sugarplums dancing in your heads, huh, Bill? - Ugh, this is... - Frustrating for yah, huh? - My God. - Those gold bars are just flying out of your mind! We'll be back. You throw out GPS coordinates on the... Publish those, somebody's gonna grab them. And start looking. So, this doesn't surprise me. I don't know what they dug up. I just wanted a permit to dig a tiny little hole. I'm a missile scientist that knows the technology. I know this works. Why don't you believe me? I said, "If you don't let me do this, I've got to publish. I've gotta put this before my peers and get judged." I'm pissed! I'm going to the sheriff when we get out of here! We give them the evidence. I want their ass kicked! And I want the goddamn politicians to wear the blood! The question is did those people come up empty handed or not? Did they get it? Or didn't they get it? Was it there ever? He did let out that he believed there was... there was deposits of something there. That has not, uh, that has gotten out to the public. And he believes that there may some deposits left. But he said a chunk of that, a big piece of that, is... has been, uh, taken out. He gave out the coordinates, and... and you know, probably shouldn't have done... well, shouldn't have done that. - Shouldn't have done that. - I think if he had to do it over again, uh, he certainly wouldn't have put those coordinates in. I don't wanna say, you know, that I... I think he's full of shit, but, you know, the first couple of days I was really questioning, you know, what... what does this guy see? What... what makes him feel this way? Why... why would he think that there's gold bars there? And I haven't seen any gold yet. I'm very interested in, you know, preserving the history, and, you know, keeping people from coming out here and dying and, you know, killing themselves, or blowing up terrain and using pipe bombs and all that kind of stuff. I'm definitely interested in helping out stop that, but my main interest is my dad, you know. This is somebody I just never really got to know. So, you know, I was angry and upset and hurt and then a little bit later, a few years later, I found out about Nathan being my half-brother. And so then you kind of deal with jealousy and that kind of stuff, and like, "Well, hey, I'm here. What about me?" Um. And then you just kind of, you know, It... it stuck with me for a while, but then as I grew older and just kind of learned to let it go. Alright so here we are on like day seven, six, somewhere in there. Psh, my days kind of gotten blurred all together. What we saw, and all those holes, is a federal crime. I didn't sleep last night. It's against the Wilderness Act, and if they got manmade items, they've also broken - the Antiquities Act. - You're the lawyer, am I wrong? - It was tough yesterday. - I know it is, don't cry. - It was just tough, you know. - You can imagine how I feel. No, I know, I've only been doing this for sixteen months. - You've been at this for... - Six years. Are you convinced that we found the Peralta Latin Heart site? As I told you before, I look through the lens, you know, of a litigation attorney, and what I could prove to a jury and what I couldn't. And this would be easy to prove. If you look at the lay of the land on that topo map I've got, - it's a total match. - No, it's a total match. And so we've had the people that were in the Dutch Hunters Club of Apache Junction stand up and acknowledge that I had succeeded. ‚ÄúRobert has found it.‚Äù They acknowledged that publicly. He's got gold fever! We bring two guys on our crew that have got gold fever that bring all the... Stop! - Yeah, but... - Stop! I brought you here and now you're all jammed up about something that somebody else did... I'm all jammed up about you two knuckleheads going around digging holes all over this place! What holes have we dug all over this place? Did you bury a single bit of the crap that you dug up yesterday? - Where you dug those casings up. - There was already a hole there. - You dug, and you walked away! - Wait a minute. You dug, and you walked away! If you can't admit that, I'm through! - That was a five-hour job. - Did you hear what I just said? Oh, you're nuttier than a fruitcake. You're a knucklehead today. You're really a knucklehead. Bill, there's gold here. Shut the fuck up. No, I don't have to shut up! There's another story here that you don't know anything about. And that's why it's important for us to bring a gold bar up... No, it is not important to bring a single piece of gold out... We are here to show that technology has proven that there's gold here! That's the backpack. That's the label that was on the orange pack that contained - the detonators and shit. - Okay. - That's the bag. - Okay, gotcha. - And where's the pipe bombs? - They had taken that, uh, grey PVC with some white PVC caps. And this is what it looked like or what? Yeah, that's... that's right, yeah, it is. Like it's all homemade shit. In that area is a lot of the land destroyed? Yeah, yeah, they dug a big hole. And then underneath that they put in a tunnel, and that's where the food and some tools was stashed. That name you found? On that bag? Yeah, sir. Yeah, we have it. We've contacted him numerous times last summer out there where he was out hiking for miles and miles and miles with no water. About four times we had to get him out of there. I tell you, it's the richest gold ore ya ever seen! Come on! Gold fever'll make you do some terrible things. It's that... it's that luster lure of a treasure. You can tell someone when someone has gold fever 'cause they just become totally turn on the dime of interest. I've had, um, some gold fever for sure. You know, I mean, not bad enough that I wanted to hit my partner over the head or anything like that. But it is an obsession. I've got the gold fever. - You still have gold fever? - Oh, one hundred percent. I mean, I wouldn't have tootled down to Florida for ten days looking for treasure on the beach if I hadn't. It's all part of it. It's all part of it. It gnaws at them, it eats away at them. That they're just there, they got to get it done, they got to get it done and we hear about that, a number of treasure hunters who died in the mountains, that they just couldn't let it go. Is your odometer working? Your mileage odometer? Well, yeah, I know, I gotta look at it. I see 160,000, is that what you're talking about? Yeah, but I wanna know the last two digits. Oh, okay. 83. - 83? - Yeah. The map that Robert cracked, the Peralta Heart Map, so far has been spot on. I've seen the bars, and we're bringing the gold out! But where... where is our destination? Our destination's right over here. - Okay. - So we've gotta go down, we've gotta go over this mountain, and then we go around Marsh Valley? - See that's where we... - Yeah. So this is where... that's where... And we're going past that today? Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can't believe you don't remember. We gotta go over that we gotta hike over that big mountain! - I'm drawing a blank. - It's a bitch. Now, do you have an idea where that is? Yes, I have an idea where that is! Like, like it's right here. I know where the arch is but I mean, you're looking at this. What indicates that you know where that is? - I don't know. - Okay. You're asking me questions, I don't know. No, I'm gonna ask you five times and then we're done. There's gonna be... There's gonna be some kind of marker. Okay, I do wanna get up here to see what they've dug. Yeah, yeah, oh no, no, I don't have any problem with that! - Because I do know- - Yeah, yeah! I do know... We do know where that is. And we do know what's under there, okay? Yeah, yeah. You can see that those arms appear to have been sheared off. And there's those two long arms create a 'V' okay? And that's the line of sight. So it's not going to be a perfect... but you know that you're gonna go in this direction. - Right. - Okay? It's got a cross cut in the very top of it, okay? That's a marker, that was cut in there, alright? Could Mother Nature have done that? Yeah but it just... it aligns right with that. I'm at that point, it's the heat... it's not even the heat of the day, and I'm melting up here, wasting a lot of energy, and uh, there's only uh, the hours that we're wasting also. He might've thought that was a Roman Numeral one 'cause there's a cross on it, and then there's a one. - I wouldn't call that a three. - It's not a Roman Numeral. I'm not saying it ain't! I wouldn't call it that. I think enough with this. I think that can be put off till later. I think we should be digging. Or, or we should be, uh researching where there may be caches undisturbed and the markers are still in place, and we can say, ‚ÄúThis is where it's at.‚Äù Right down here is a rock with fricking rocks piled on top of it is a marker! Those rocks were put there! You just don't have a pile of rocks to have a pile of rocks! Those things are heavy. And that's a fricking marker, and it's next to he crossed saguaro. It all... It all fits. This is a one bar site. This is, you know what I'm saying? - So this is... - Why? Let go. You need to know what to look for. You need to look for cuts in saguaro cactuses. You need to look for rocks that are piled up on top of each other 'cause that's how they would mark it! - I got it! - All right, well. - Let's move on! - Okay, we're moving on. I would like to set up a plan where we can actually prove that this, uh, this research had... that was done by Kess is valid. All we can do is go look and observe and see if we can... - See if we can... - Figure out because we don't - have the scanner. - Mhm. So. First off, this is on the map, okay? And there's... it shows that there's a... Here, let me pull it out. That spike, all I've heard from Kesselring is, ‚ÄúThe spike! The spike!" Once you find a spike, that is a telltale sign that they have that's a... that they've hidden... they've buried gold bullion! Men put this together. Uh, James, we're not gonna destroy that. That's too precious of a thing, I'm not gonna destroy it. - It ain't precious to me! - Well, I just... I'm not saying it shouldn't be here when we get done! I'm saying we can take pictures of it and put it back together - 90 percent of the way it was. - No, we can't. - No, we can't. - This is not a religious - fucking thing! - Well, I understand, but I'd... Don't get religious on me! Well, I'm telling you! I'm not talking about destroying stuff, I'm just talking about taking the door off and putting the door back on. What, are you gonna move that? That's not part of... that's not part of it. Take that off of there. Well, I don't wanna be stupid about some of this shit, and that's stupid. I think I can dig right here. Is it alright if I move this, Bill? I wanna say this, though, I wanna just question you one more time on this. You basically were saying it's underneath this. It could be. Well, it could be to the side. According to the map, right over here is another cache site. So I'm just gonna walk over here right over here and see if I can see anything that looks... Now what does that look like to you? That looks like a fucking... fricking one of those spike markers. But, you know, it could just be a regular rock. - Hey, Bill. - Huh? What'd you see on the screen? - I saw the gold bars! - Here? - Yeah. - Here's... here's... James, it's saying there's 5,000 bars there. So it's gonna be massive. My guess is, it would be there. Because that's where the deeper mud is, right? As the slope goes up, it's another foot. I don't know, I mean, it's an idiot project to me. Bill, how many? Give me that number again? 5,000. Five thousand? That's a lot, man. 5,000 bars? Where? You know what I'm saying? All I'm waiting for is that full moon. When it comes through that window, it'll light up the patch of ground where I'm to dig. I'm standing right in the center of it! Right here! This is where I dig. 20 million bucks worth. It is the moon that'll point out that gold, it'll only do it once a year on the anniversary of the night the Peraltas made that sign. That's the catch, when was that sign made? What night? What hour? What moment? If I could figure that out, I'd hit the jackpot! In my mind, if something monetarily comes of it, it's gonna come down the road, if we discover something, 'cause it's like finding the Titanic! James Cameron, they make 20 million dollars a year taking all that... taking all the uh, artifacts that they found, uh, from the Titanic around the country. You do things for passion, okay, and this is being part of history, coming out in the Superstition where thousands of people have been out here trying to locate stuff. If I could've been, you know, and I still feel I will, but you know, to be a part of that? It's being a part of history, so money didn't have that much... didn't have that much... I wasn't even thinking about money! You know, do I have gold fever? I've never been... I've never been prospecting in my life except this time, you know, so if I had gold fever, it would've started a long time ago. There's no doubt in my mind, if those guys hadn't blown up the side of that mountain and taken 13 hundred gold bars that were there that I saw on the scanning? No problem, there's no doubt in my mind. And I know there's bars back there, you know? It's just you gotta have that scanner. So I'm coming out here again. With Jason and I can guarantee... well, I can't guarantee anything. I thought we'd have one now. I'm pretty sure that we'll be able to locate, uh, you know, those bars. I had no business coming right now. I had no fucking business. I need help with my pack to put it on. We're almost... we're almost up. Mother of pearl. God fricking. Woo. Schoose is here, Feldman's here, San Felice is here. - Yeah, I saw him. - This is? - Gary. - My son, Nathan. - Nathan. - Jason. - Jason! - You have a son named Nathan? - Yeah, I got... - Okay, I'm hoping so. - Too many kids. - 'Cause that really sucks - if he doesn't. - Oh, no, yeah. - Bar's open right? - Bar's open. - Nice meeting you, Nathan. - Jason! This year, Treasure Hunter's 25th Annual Awards Presentation. "To a true mountain man and treasure hunter. You will be remembered by us all forever and always. Happy trails, thanks for the campfires we have shared." It is an honor and a privilege to present this award to Brian Lichtman! I've looked for this mine a long time with my good partner, - Ron Feldman, here... - No matter what he's done, Robert Kesselring would be on a list for an award. But he's not being accepted by all of the people that have spent their lives out there. - How do you spell that again? - Uh, Walz, W-A-L-Z. Jacob Walz. Nope, nobody with that name ever registered a claim here. This record goes clear back to 1870. But there must've been, the Lost Dutchman was supposed to be worth a fortune, he wouldn't just leave - that money laying around. - Maybe he never found a mine. Some people don't believe there ever was a Lost Dutchman. Anybody that would use Thunder Gods Gold as the Bible is, uh, shooting blanks. Yeah, it's got a lot of information in it, but realize that Barry Storm created a lot of the information. According to my friend who was out there with him, he had a little problem with drinking and so he did a lot of that instead of doing a lot of this uh, treasure hunting. Barry Storm, in his time in the '40s...'30s and '40s was using what was considered state-of-the-art electronics and detecting equipment. It seems ridiculous now, looks like a bunch of PVC framework they're carrying around, not too much different than what we see now still, though. I guess if you were to look at it in one certain way they're all competing. Everybody's competing for the, you know, the same ultimate goals. To the people that wanna call Dad a fraud, I just, I shake my head them, like, okay. If that's what you think, but I believe him. That's just, yeah, I have no other thought other than, right, I believe him. It's a good story. And it's a great legend. There is something magical about it. The true believers will believe these stories, though, because they are feasible. They're plausible. But, uh, take you down the path of plausibility, you just have to figure out where to get off. Place like this is just made for folklore. It gives the dreamers the opportunity to dream. We all need that. Thank you for calling SenArt Films. If you know your party's extension, you may dial it at any time. Hello, Mr. May, my name is Brian McDonough. I'm a gold miner from Arizona. I'm calling to tell you about the film that you're producing right now. I've spent 30 years prospecting for gold in Arizona. Kesselring, Schoose, Feldman, Tuttle. They all know that I've found the mine. I never looked for the mine, I found it. It came to me. They're just a little pissed off and a little upset that a prospecting cab driver has found the mine, not them. If you guys tell the story from these assholes, these idiots in Apache Junction, that are nothing but a bunch of crazy-eyed whack jobs, that the mine has not been found and that it's some kind of farce legend, or the stones were carved in someone's garage, that's a bunch of hogwash! Up on Stoneman Lake Road, when I was just a kid my dad said, when you pass here, look around those outlaws came this way with that stolen. Clarkdale payroll. They were caught, But the bag was never found. And after all these years, Each time I drive that road. My eyes are always searching, so it seems. But I don't know if I'm looking for that lost outlaw payroll. Or searching for a kid's forgotten dreams. That secret canyon never really given up its secrets. Does Peralta Canyon hide a Spanish mine? Are those silver pesos buried beside the Reavis Trail. Is the Dutchman's gold still there for men to find. Oh, I never found that fame. Never even found a nugget. No outlaw stash nor mystic motherlode. But as time goes by, I realize. The joy is in the searching. And I'd rather have the stories than the gold. That secret canyon never really given up its secrets. Does Peralta Canyon hide a Spanish mine? Are those silver pesos buried beside the Reavis Trail. Is the Dutchman's gold still there for men to find. Did the Dutchman ever really have a mine. Hey there, partners! Welcome to Goldfield Ghost Town! I'm Jacob Waltz, The Lost Dutchman! Come on over here, now, and I'll tell you how to find my goldmine! Everybody that has ever hunted the Lost Dutchman Mine knows where it is, including myself, and every one of us is in a different location. These guys believe what... in their theories that they come up with. They will always tell you where there's not gold. And they will tell you how there's fraud, and there's... there's been plenty of fraud. There ain't a whole lot of facts about The Lost Dutchman Mine. They're all stories. Legends. Of all the people you know, how many stories do you know that are actually true? How many stories that I've heard do I think are actually true? Mine! We haven't had any luck but we're absolutely positive that there is a treasure in there. If you look at the people that are here today, none of them are quitters. All of them are absolutely dedicated to answering the question. Next time, when we come back out, we're gonna get in it, I guarantee it. I imagine that same feeling that I had before is going to be right back in my stomach. I'm just gonna keep the faith and keep on digging.
