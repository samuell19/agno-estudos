Rama, you haven't gone to bed yet? Looking for solution to your helplessness in law books? I was looking for a solution to this problem. There is a solution, but your ego.. Rama. As a wife, I never asked for anything from you. But as a mother, I cannot keep quiet.. and allow my child to be sacrificed. Who you have reared as a mother is related to me too. Even I have loved him as a father. And today, sitting in the chair of justice.. you are desperate to give your verdict. The law will punish the wrongdoers. Is a brother saying this, or Judge Ravi Khanna? Right now, a brother is talking. No, even now, a judge sitting on the chair of blind law is talking. I am only doing my duty. I am not talking of law, court or witness box. I am talking of this home and those who live here. This is not a family matter. If it was.. I would get angry as a brother, scold, reprimand, and fall silent But this is a matter of law. And sitting in the chair of justice.. I cannot do injustice. Injustice is being done now. Rama, don't forget he's a murderer. Pardon me, it's not been proved yet that he's committed the murder As a judge, you have no right to give this decision right now. I'm sorry, I'd forgotten. You are forgetting a lot. But I still remember a few loopholes of law. If you will make your brother stand in the box.. even I will stand as a rock against you and try to save him. Today's headlines! Murderer Sumeet Khanna to be presented in court tomorrow.. Today's headlines! Yes, I have spoken. Someone has to take the step. Any way Thanks a lot hold on. Hello Yes, I'm leaving now. Yes Mr. Verma.. I have decided. No, I don't need to take anyone's permission in this case. Keep the papers ready, I'm leaving. Thank you. I am going to court. - Yes. - Today.. Please! don't say anything today. Even I was going to tell you that. Like always, don't wish me good luck today. But you can wish me good luck. You can bless me to succeed. Good luck, Thank you. Won't you come along? I would, if you came as a husband, or a brother. We want justice. Please do justice. Your brother is a murderer. He's killed 5 innocent college students. Will you be able to do justice to them? The path your younger brother has taken as the path of justice.. will you be able to prove it as the path of injustice? The murderer is your younger brother. Could it be that while giving verdict, your blood compels you? Give some reply atleast. You had stopped practicing. Did your brother-in-law compel you to start again? You are pitted against your husband, Justice Khanna. Will justice be crushed in the fight between husband and wife? Are you sure your arguments will be able to prove.. your brother-in-law, Sumeet, innocent? The police van has come. - The murderer is in it. He is very dangerous. He has committed 5 murders. He has come. Let the proceedings begin. Accused Sumeet Khanna be present! My Lord, this man who is standing with his head bowed.. this is not his true face. His true face is hiding behind the mask of his crime. His crime can never be pardoned. This man who committed 7 murders.. if he is sentenced to death 7 times, it is not enough. Point to be noted, My Lord. Please don't ignore it. Thank you your honour. My Lord, the prosecutor just now, in a very dramatic style.. narrated a baseless story against my client. He even accused my client of committing 7 murders. Can my colleague present a single evidence.. that proves those murders were committed by Sumeet Khanna? Can my colleague give a reply.. that after loving a girl madly.. why did my client have to kill her? Why did he have to kill a leech, drunkard photographer? The murder of an infamous college student Prem.. Objection My Lord. The defence lawyer is forgetting this is a murder case.. not a clarification case. Objection sustained. These things are connected to the case, Your Honor. It will be better if you stick to the charge. Alright, Your Honor. Apart from Prem, other murders were also committed. But no one saw the murders being committed. Inspector Khan arrested the accused red handed.. at the scene of crime. Your Honor, I request Inspector Khan be called to the witness box. Permission granted. I will speak nothing but the truth. Mr. Khan, where did you arrest Sumeet? In the street. - Street? - Yes. I was following him from the hospital. Why were you following him? Because, after attacking Lorgez, he was trying to run away. Attack on Lorgez? But as per the doctor's report, Lorgez died on 28 June. And you arrested Sumeet on 30 June. I.. - That means that Sumeet attacked Lorgez.. who had died two days earlier. Sorry? Order.. Order.. Order. Inspector Khan, if Lorgez had died two days earlier.. on what charge did you arrest Sumeet? I.. The court is adjourned for the day. The case is not over Mr. Malhotra, it has begun. I am not so foolish. The intention for calling you here is to know.. whether you are feeling what we all are. Feeling? I don't understand. Despite being a lawyer, you don't understand? Strange! It means that your brain is working more than all of us. I don't understand your riddles. My words are not a riddle. Anyway, I'll explain. - Name of accused? - Sumeet. Full name. - Sumeet Khanna. The defence lawyer? - Rama Khanna. The judge's name? - Ravi Khanna. Which means, the murderer is Khanna.. the defence lawyer is a Khanna, and the judge is a Khanna. If you sill don't understand, I'll explain it even better. The younger brother a murderer, the sister-in-law a lawyer.. and the elder brother a judge. Everyone knows that. Then we must know this case's position and it's verdict. Whatever we do, what these Khannas' want will happen. Only you think so. I've spent all my life in legal circles. I have won the weakest of cases. You're challenging my capability? You misunderstand. I am not challenging.. the opposition party is challenging all of us. This woman will not fight the case only in court.. but also outside it. Don't forget she is the wife of Judge Khanna. And Khanna will do whatever his wife says. The law is not blind. - I don't know that. I only want you to give an application to the Chief Justice.. and get this case transferred to another court.. citing the relationship between the accused & the judge. Mst. Malhotra If this was possible, that's the first thing I would do. Don't worry, my experience says the verdict will be in our favor. Okay, we'll follow his experience. Let's see who wins the case. Only time will tell. - Rama you are out of your mind. I'm not! If you give the wrong verdict, I will go to the supreme court. Why will I give the wrong verdict? I don't have personal enmity with Sumeet. In the court, he is an accused, and I am the judge. There is no question of any relationship. Rama, right now, the whole city's eyes are glued on me. Law, Press, my colleagues, the parents of the deceased.. everyone is looking at me like hungry vultures. And I, a helpless brother.. is carrying the burden of my responsibility and my love. The moment I tire and fall, the vultures will gobble me up! Sumeet has only reached the court yet. I was hung on the gallows the moment he got arrested. It is surprising that I have not died yet. If Lorgez had died on 28 June.. why was his body kept in the hospital for two days? I was waiting for the killer. Waiting for the killer after death? Yes. Because I'd told the Press Lorgez is alive, not dead. Any specific reason? Lorgez Anthony was the only man who could identify the attacker. And if this final proof, the eye witness, would identify the killer.. he would be trapped. That is why I played this trick. And your trick worked? - Yes. Then to kill Lorgez, he entered that room where his corpse was? Yes. - So who entered that room? Sumeet Khanna, in disguise. Order .Order.. In what disguise? - In a doctor's guise. What did Sumeet try to do after entering the room? Sumeet He drew out a knife from his pocket. Yes. Inspector Khan, is this that knife.. with which he was going to attack Lorgez? Objection Your Honor. Not Lorgez, his corpse. - It's the same thing. Thank you Inspector Khan you can go. Your Honor, the accused tried to get the last proof.. the eye witness, out of his way. He had removed Lorgez from his way two days earlier. If Inspector Khan had not been wise and cunning.. the accused would be preparing to kill someone else today. To hide his one crime, he committed six other murders. And he started his crime with raping a girl. No, that's not true! Who the girl trusted, he only was raping her. I did not rape anyone. When she started screaming, you stifled her voice.. and silenced her forever. No, I did not commit this murder. Then who did you kill? The photographer? - No. Prem, Pancham, Lorgez, Rani and Mona? Didn't you kill all these people because they were witnesses.. and they had all seen you kill Anju Tell me. That's not true. - It is true, you have committed these murders. You killed all of them one by one. Yes, I killed all of them! I killed them all! I killed them all! No Sumeet, you did not Commit any murder. You are saying this under pressure. You're not in your senses. No, I am in my senses. I killed them all. I confess my crime. But I did not kill Anju. I loved her more than my life. I loved Anju very much. I loved her very much. Beautiful. Steady! Please. Yeah. Yeah. That's beautiful. Now turn a little.. Wait a minute. Don't keep it down. Keep your hand a little higher. - Okay. That's better. One second. Ready. Let's go. Click. "After coming into your arms.." "After coming into your arms.." "..I am not in my senses. Forget it. "After coming into your arms.." "..I am not in my senses. Forget it.

How much is the profit? Call me tomorrow morning, I'll tell you. Ok. Good night. What name did you say of that boy? - Sumeet Khanna, sir. Judge Ravi Khanna's younger brother? - Yes. He is a very good boy, and the family is also very good. Right now, I am worried about my family's honor. Sumeet. - Yes. Sumeet. Let's go. Let's go! 'Let us not go yet..' Mr. Lover, it is very late. Let's go home. Anju, promise me that your every heartbeat.. will be my heartbeat. Your every breath will be my breath. Yes Sumeet. I promise. You Old lady! Is this the way to promise? So Mr.20th Century, will you tell me.. how a promise is made? Shall I? Stop. Inspector, you? I'm not an inspector, I'm a constable. You look like an inspector. Right Anju? What inspector, he looks like a commissioner. No buttering. You have been here enough. This is a danger area. Leave! Surprising! It is a crime even to speak the truth. Move! - Hop on, Anju. Bye inspector. - Bye commissioner. Why did the house come so soon? - You have gone crazy. You are responsible for it. papa! papa! Do I look like papa to you? - Not yours, my papa! Let's meet him. - Sumeet, please leave, or I'll be in trouble. Then promise to meet me tomorrow. - I will. Bay, Bay. papa You are still awake? And this piano? Yes, I'm awake because I'm a father. And I cannot sleep because this father's young daughter.. has not returned home till 1 am. - Oh Papa. And where the piano is concerned, I was playing it.. because the house was deserted. There was no one to talk to me. And I had to talk to someone. I am sorry papa. I will never give you cause for complain again. I made a mistake. No, I made a mistake. Being busy, I never realized.. my daughter has grown up. She doesn't need her father's home anymore. What are you saying! - The fact. I must fulfil the duty of a father now.. by finding a good boy for you. - Papa, I.. It is very late. Good night, Good night papa. Sir, I didn't understand the style of your love. Even I don't understand it. Instead of writing the letter, you could have spoken to her. When a daughter grows up, mothers say such things. But Anju is not destined to a mother's love. You have given her the love of both, mother and father. I'm trying. Anyway, are my tickets confirmed? Yes sir confirmed. Good morning papa. Anju dear, all night I kept thinking why I didn't fulfill.. a father's duty. I thought, the faster I fulfill this duty, the better. After due thought, I decided on a family and choose a boy for you I don't know how you will react to my choice. I didn't have the courage to see it. Anyway, the picture is here, see it. I hope you like the boy. Tell me when I return.. whether you like my choice or.. One more thing. You will go to college from tomorrow. You have got admission to the college of your choice. Love papa. I love you papa. Hello Sumeet, you! I am very happy today. Very good. Tell me about it. The first good news is that I've got admission in your college. Wow. And the other good news.. No, not now. I'll tell you when I meet you. - When are you meeting you? Why, won't you take me to college on my first day? Why just the first day? I'll take you always. I'll wait for you. Bye! Ok bay Yes. Bhabhi (sister-in-law) I'm going to college. Have breakfast and go. - Breakfast? No Bhabhi, I'm dieting. On such occasions, you don't diet, it happens. What occasions? - Tell him. You tell him. - No, tell him. You two sit and decide. I'm getting late, I'll miss my class. Miss class, but don't miss Miss. What? Don't miss Miss. Understood? Go. - Okay brother. Bye, bye. See! He will become a judge or lawyer. One more. - No. - Please. I don't want it. Look. Sunil. Sumeet, we have to go to college, not hospital. Okay, let's go to college. Wow! she's sweet. Come. Wow! she's electrifying! Hey! will you kill me? Why are you standing in the middle of the road like a dustbin? The municipality van will take you away as thrash. The van is also there, and also the sweeper. This? The municipality van is fit for you. Who are you? I am Krishna Iyer, M.A. The bike man; understand? The idiot spoilt my mood. What a girl she was! She was amazing! I Must tell the gang. Hey Guru! Wrestler. - Idiot! I'm a boxer. Okay! Boxer. - What is it? A new babe has come to college. - So what do I do? Once you come and see, you will forget all your boxing. Is it? - I gave you such good news, and you.. This is not news for you, it's for Prem. Where is Prem? Good. - Jai Mata Di. Pack it. - I want more money this time. Who doesn't need money? - You don't understand. A case is running on my shop. If I can get Rs.1000 more.. it will help. - I understand everything, Chander. This is your story always. Take Rs.300. I honestly need money. - It's correct. You make so much money, can't you help me a little? Prem yes Coming. Hay baby. What is the matter? You look very upset. I'm getting married. Married? You need to get married too? Am I dead? - I plead with you, Prem. Please give me those pictures and negatives. I'll never forget that favor of yours. Favor? I don't do a favor to anybody. And this pleading also is not going to help. You want the negatives? Prem your phone. You will get them. Just arrange Rs.10000. Rs.10000! - Only Rs.10000. Where will I get the money from? - Prem, your phone. Coming. Rani will explain that to you. Explain to her. Sour. Hello - Prem, where are you? - Anything special? Very special. A babe has come to college. See her once and you'll forget all your old girls. Let me settle my old account first. My mother reared me with so many hopes, so many dreams. She worked hard. Seeing my mother's effort.. my heart cried. I said, swear on one who has given birth. I took a vow to fulfil my mother's dream. Yes. Say it in Dilip Kumar style. - Not now. Don't refuse. A girl is telling you so sweetly. Go ahead. Tell. Please tell. My mother reared me with so many hopes, so many dreams. She worked hard. Seeing my mother's effort, my heart cried. I said, I vow on river Ganges and Jamuna. That I will fulfill my mother's dream. Yes. Now in Shatru style. - No, it won't be fun now. Come on! - Okay. So many hopes, so many dreams.. What's going on? - Shut-up! Roll number 1. - Yes sir. Roll number 2. - Yes sir. Roll number 3. - Yes sir. Roll number 4. - Yes sir. What? - She's the girl. - This one? - Yes. She's really beautiful. I said number 5. Why did you stop at roll no.5, Professor? Saw red light and your voice got stuck? Keep calling. Even if you don't get a reply, mark me present. Number 6. - Yes sir. Sit down Sixer (eunuch), or you will tire. Behave yourselves. What happened, Prem? How did this idiot get this babe? I'll have to crush the girl's pride. Sumeet, you take every little thing to heart. Hello Sumeet. Hello Anita. How are you? - I'm the same, but you look very happy. Won't you introduce me to her? - Why not? She's Anju. And she's.. - Anita. Pleased to meet you. - And this pleasure will stay. She has joined college only today. Your neck will sprain, Prem. Sumeet Rani! You come and see me in my office. Now go take his firing. - Let me see how much he can fire me. Where are you lost? - The poor girl is in trouble. We'll be in trouble if we get late. - Late? Yes. We have to buy a gift for Bhabhi. - A gift? Tomorrow is Bhabhi's birthday. - Birthday! "Live as one more is added to your age.." "..and one more evening of the life has come.." "Dance with joy in this gathering.." "..as one more lamp has been lit.." "The anklets tinked again.." "Again it is me and it is you.." "The anklets tinked again.." "Again it is me and it is you.."

She is so good. - She is my mother. Brother has reared me like a father, not a brother. He never let me miss my parents. I don't know why, my heart keeps wanting to meet Bhabhi. Why just meet, you'll stay with her forever. How? - As her daughter-in-law. 'He held her hand' 'Now he touched her cheek' 'Then he looked at me. 'He looked into her eyes. Then he got angry' - Shut up. Hey eunuch! talk properly. - No Sumeet, you have my promise. 'No one beat my lover with a stone' Sumeet no Sumeet. Say another word and I'll thrash you! Guru.. Guru! Why are you barking like a dog? Then what else do I do? That idiot insulted me. He beat me. He beat your man, Prem. Who? - Whoever beat him, he deserves it. Shut-up! That eunuch, Anju's stooge. He caught my neck. I warned him I am Prem's man. Know what he said in everyone's presence? He said 'bring Prem's father too' How dare he! Let's go! Brother, get three plates of omelet. Hurry up. "Hey baby, give me a kiss.." You are still reading? Very good. Water. Baby, you won't eat anything? Mister. - Who called me mister? This is gutter water. - I have brought it from the canteen drum. And you find it gutter water? I see dirt in the water. Do one thing. Get a filter from your home tomorrow. I'll give you filter water. No, I don't want the other students to drink dirty water. I will tell the manager and get a filter each for every student. I can do anything! Understand? He doesn't have money for tea and cigarette. He will provide everyone with filter water. I'll tell the real hoodlum and get you thrashed! Brother, please come. Welcome. Hi.. Tell me. - Yes? - A cold drink for me, and.. what will you have? I am not in mood. Sumeet! you upset yourself over every little thing. You must not mind such hoodlums. What? Am I a hoodlum? Baby, you called me a hoodlum? You abused my character? I am not a hoodlum. I have come here from Madras.. What behavior is this! - I'll teach you what manners are! Want to get thrashed here, or outside? - Leave him! Hey babe! I've not even touched you yet, why are you interfering? Shut up! What did you say? - Dog! However hard you try, a dog's tail can never be straightened. You called me a dog? A dog is called a dog only. You still haven't got over the habit of bullying kids. Try fighting a lion! Let's go! You are breaking up my things! What is going on here? Principal, a riot! My canteen has been ruined! Egg!! There's hoodlum before me. Is there someone? Hit them! Principal sir! Stop it! Sir, he started it all. I tried hard to make him stop.. but he wouldn't relent. Pervez. You are rusticated from the college. Get out! There is a world outside college too. I'll fix you! I say, get out! Students, you get back to your classes. Go! Sit down, eunuch! You will tire. 'Now he touched her cheek' Speak properly! 'No one beat my lover with a stone' Leave him Sumeet, you have my promise. What behavior is this? - I'll fix you! You are a coward, Sumeet! You are a weakling. No.. no, I'm not a coward. If you are not a coward, why do you allow yourself to be insulted? I don't want to mess with them. Don't cover up your cowardice with lies. You have no shame, no courage. What kind of a man are you? One who cannot protect himself, what will he protect Anju? Wonder what Anju must be thinking of you. Maybe she is also laughing at you. Shut up! Will you? Hello. - Hello, Sumeet. Actually, I love you. Yes.. - Hello.. Hello Sumeet. What is the matter? You didn't answer me. I'm sleepy. - Sorry I disturbed you. Anyway, you're coming to pick me up tomorrow morning, aren't you? I'll be late. I'll see you in college. Bye.. I love you. - Good night. Prem, the babe is coming alone today. Hello madam. - Yes mister. Looks like you are angry with us. Though, there is no enmity between us. I'm not friends with you either. How long does it take to make friends? Only your consent is required. Who do you think you are? I don't think anything of myself. But the whole college considers me crazy about you. Mind your tongue, or else..! - Or else what? You'll kill me? The one who your style has already killed.. why kill.. That is Prem's cheek, and Rani's hand. Looks like you don't know us yet. It is you who has not recognised me. Looks like I will have to introduce myself now. Yes.. - May I come in, sir? Come in. What do you treat college as? Do you come here to study, or to tease girls? You are mistaken, sir. Not me, you guys are mistaken. You must have thought even this girl will not say anything.. and silently suffer her humiliation. But Anju is not such a girl. Do you know who Anju is, whose daughter she is? She is Dewan Pratap Singh's daughter, our college trustee. And I cannot annoy him. I have only two options. See this. Sir, this is.. - An apology. Sign it. There is one more solution. See this. Rusticate? - Yes. You guys think what is to be done. Apology? Strange! he licked a girl's feet? The principal must have threatened to rusticate him. What else would he do? Whatever, that Anju is a brave girl. Atleast she is not a coward like us. Atleast she stood up to him. Yes, but she didn't think of the consequence. You are right. She didn't think of the consequence. Right Pancham? - She has invited trouble. She is no ordinary girl. If her dad comes to know.. he will have you arrested. Are you her uncle? Why are you taking revenge of your humiliation from me? Don't talk too much, I'm warning you! Let's go, Pancham. He's lost face, but not his pride. Strange! The way you are standing silent.. like you are not thinking about our insult, but some beautiful girl Where is he the college hoodlum anymore. Seeing Anju, he has lost it. Prem, I don't think you did right in apologizing. I apologized because I didn't want that golden goose.. to slip out of our hands. - Meaning? What do you mean. Now that girl will get filmed on my camera.. and developed at Chander's studio for my interest. Great idea! Sure.. okay.. okay. - Excuse me. Okay, bye. You? What is it? - I want Sumeet.. Why? Did he call you? No, I just came to meet him. - Any special reason? Look, whatever is happening is not right. Sumeet is spoiling. He is ruining his career because of you. And all this is happening because of you. Because of me? Is it not his mistake at all? Because he is your brother? What is regretful is that idiot is my brother. Anyway, he has realized now.. whatever he was doing was his ideocracy, his stupidity. Stupidity? - Yes, stupidity. You may leave. Listen. - Yes? You'd come to meet Sumeet? - Yes. - Did you meet him? Where did you give me the chance? Now this is too much! We spoke for so long, and you didn't say once.. And I thought he had sent you. Anyway, he is in his room. Go and meet him. Also ask him when he wants to get married.. to you. What! You? These tears? What happened to you? They are tears of joy. Your brother gave me loads of happiness today. Brother? - Yes. Your brother is a very nice man. Whose brother is he after all? Mine! You are not as great as him. - I am greater than him. Greater.. Is it? I'll accept you are great on one condition. What condition? - If you come for the camp. Anju, the camp.. You know I don't like too much noise. For my sake, please! For your sake? Agreed. Sumeet, you are great.

Come on! - Honestly, the moon in ..the sky is pale against my moon Liar! - No, honest. I swear by Anju. Anju's false promise? What'll you lose.. ..if anything happens to Anju? For God sake, please don't say that again. If anything happens to you, even heaven will become hell for me. Who knows? Anyway, it is late, the warden will scream. Let's go. - I don't feel like going to the camp. And we are not allowed to stay out late. Let's go, please! Please.. - Okay. On one condition. You will come after everyone goes to bed. Impossible.. - Please.. What is wrong with you? - I don't know. I don't feel like separating from you. I feel like.. - What? - I'll tell you when you meet me. Why don't you understand? - Will you try to come? I.. - You have my promise. Can't you do that much for me? For you, I can even give my life. I don't want your life. In this moonlit night, we both will sit close to each other. I will hold your hands and look at you for long. You can do that much. - You have put me in a fix. Okay, but I'll be a bit late. Just promise me and I will spend all my life waiting for you. My crazy lover! Okay, I am going, I'm getting late. Remember the promise? Good night. No good night, I'll be waiting for you. I love you.. - Okay. Bye. Anju.. Hey Anju.. Honestly, the moon in the ..sky is pale against my moon. Liar! For God sake, please don't say that again. If anything happens to you, even heaven will become hell for me. Who knows? I don't know. I don't feel like separating from you. I feel like.. Anju, will you come? Will you come, Anju? - Yes. Hey crazy! Look, I have come. I kept my promise. Thank you. You! - Yes, me. You think you can stick my apology on the wall.. and humiliate me? You defeated me? I'll show you what humiliation is. I'll disgrace you so much.. you won't lift your head before the world. Look! Help me! Rani, take. Come on dude, your turn. Sumeet. Sumeet. - Anita.. You, over here? - Where is Anju? What do you mean? She came to meet you. - Me? Yes, I myself saw her leave. She didn't come here. - Then where did she go? No! Sumeet! - Anju! Listen Sumeet! Sumeet! - Anju! Anju. - Anju, where are you? Anju! Anju! Anju. Anju. Anju. Anju. Anju. - Anju. Anju. Anju. - Anju. Anju. Anju. - Anju. Anju. - Anju. Anju. - Anju. Anju. - Anju. Anju. - Anju. Prem, she's dead! - Yes. - What now? Anju. - Anju. They are coming this way. Take her from here. Take her from here. Hurry up! Anju. - Anju. Anju. - Anju. Prem, Pancham, they are coming here. Anju. - Anju. Remove the roll from the camera. They are coming. - I'm removing it. Anju. - Anju. They are coming this way! Let's go! Anju. - Anju. Anju. - Anju. No.. no! Anju! - Anju.. Anju. - Anju. Anju. - Anju. How did this happen? Anju. Anju. This cannot happen, Anju! No, Anju.. - Sumeet. Anju. As far as I think, it could have been a wild animal. Even bandits visit this thick jungle. Until a police inquiry is conducted.. it is difficult to tell the real cause of death. We had come here to camp. What will we have to do now? Don't worry, I've informed the police. They'll come here any minute. What way is this of leaving your father's home? What mistake did I make? What are you punishing me for? Don't leave me and go. I will not go against your wishes. Mr. Dewan, have courage. What courage, Principal? I'm shattered. Don't leave me and go. Talk to me. Talk to me. "Why should we be mentioned as two, when we share the same heart?" "Why shouldn't we meet in such a way.." "..that we become each others for ever." "Why should we be mentioned as two, when we share the same heart?" "Why shouldn't we meet in such.." " ..a way that we become each others for ever." "You take my share of nectar and give me your share of poison.." "Why shouldn't I sacrifice everything and die as a martyr?" "The one who loves knows the meaning.." "The one who loves knows the meaning.." "..of fire of passion.." "Dear, this is the opportunity.." "Dear, this is the opportunity to live or to die.." "After coming into your arms I don't feel like going anywhere else.." "Dear, this is the opportunity.." "..to live or to die.." Hey, alone today? That too, until so late? Get up, it's very late. It is midnight, and he has not returned yet. Don't worry, he will come. How can I not worry knowing how upset he is. I don't know why, I am very worried. Over every small thing, you.. - Is this a small thing? It is 12 O'clock. Why don't you go and look for him? Where do I go and look for him at this hour? All his friends, his acquaintances.. I have called them all. Have patience, he'll come. When? That's what I've been hearing since two hours. Okay, I'll keep quiet. - Go and sleep, I'll wait for him. Rama. - Please! I said you go and sleep, I'll wait for him. Sumeet.. Where had you gone? - You haven't gone to bed yet? That's not the answer to my question. Where were you for so long? I was out. - Where out? Despite knowing everyone will be worried at home? Couldn't you have called? - So what if I didn't? If I go out for one day, what's the big deal? I'm not a kid anymore. You are right. You are not a kid anymore. I'd even forgotten I'm not your mother. I'm just your elder brother's wife.. with whom you share no blood ties. I am crazy. Rearing you since so many years.. I'd begun to exert my right. I had forgotten my limits. I.. What is the matter? Is Sumeet.. God forbid! may nothing happen to him. - Then what is it? Nothing. - There is something. You have my promise.. Why do you have to give me a promise over such a small thing? What is the small thing? - He came late, I scolded him. That's all? Good you scolded him. I didn't do right. He is not a kid anymore. Rama, he will always be a kid for you. Why are you so upset after scolding him? Don't cry. What is this, Rama? Be a good girl. 'Yes, you are right. You are not a kid anymore.' 'I'd even forgotten I'm not your mother.' 'I'm just your elder brother's wife.. with whom you share no blood ties.' 'I am crazy. Rearing you since so many years.. I'd begun to exert my right.' 'I had forgotten my limits.' 'I..' Madam, shall I wake Sumeet up? - No, let him sleep. He went to bed late last night. - Alright. Keep this vase there. - Yes. Sister-in-law.. You are up? I'll get tea for you. Forgive me, I spoke all nonsense last night. Sister-in-law.. I will never trouble you again. I'll do whatever you say. I will do everything you say. I promise. You won't break the promise, will you? - No. Atleast forgive me now. - Okay, but on one condition. What condition? - You'll never return home late. Agreed. - And you will go to college everyday. That's it? Can't promise? Okay, I'll even go to college. Juliet had only one aim in life, and the was, Romeo. Seeing Romeo's dead body, she started crying. She felt like she had no desire to live. She didn't know that the poison Romeo had consumed.. was not poison, it was elixir. She took a dagger and pierced it in her stomach.. thinking she will unite with Romeo forever. This is that immortal story of love, where a girl.. on her lover's death, gives up her life.. with the hope that she will meet her lover in their next life.. and will repeat her love story. But that didn't happen. ..Destiny had decided something else. When Romeo recovered, he saw Juliet's dead body. His own state became like a living corpse. Eyes stoned, lips sealed, unaware of the world.. burdened with sorrow. He broke down and wept over losing his beloved. Sumeet! You are crying? - No. Then are your eyes lying? These tears are not falling just like that. Please Sumeet, try to gather yourself. How much do I fight myself? Where do I escape from her memories? I made my heart strong and cremated her. But what do I do with her charming image.. that my eyes hold? Should I break my eyes? When did I say that, Sumeet? If Anju dwells in your eyes.. why are you making her flow away in tears? Capture her image and every memory in your brain and heart. Make her love your strength. Yes Sumeet, make her love your strength. And, don't ever cry again, you have the promise of your love. Excuse me. It's all his fault. - Pancham, speak! It's not my fault. - Idiot! Where did the film roll go? Where is the roll? - I don't know. If anyone finds the roll, we all will be hanged! And Anju's pictures.. What is the matter? Nothing. - There is something. Tell me. - Some guys were talking about some film roll. Film roll. - It felt the roll was very important. And if anyone finds it, they could go to the gallows. Noose? Who would go to the gallows? - I don't know who they were. But then, they took Anju's name. Anju? Then? ..I tried to identify their voice, but.. Roll? Film roll? Anju. Yes! I had found a roll. - Where? That night when that incident happened with Anju.. I found it while looking for her. - Where is it? Hail the Lord! Tell me. - Print and develop this roll. It's urgent. - Okay, come back after 2 hours and take the prints. Thank you. - Jai Mata Di. Let's go, Sumeet. He has called us after two hours. What are you doing! The roll will spoil. I'll open it! Give me my prints, quick! I'll give you. - Where is my parcel? Whenever you come here, you are in a hurry. You are always fussing like this. I'm coming. How much will you honk? Here you are. - Is it all okay? Yes, everything is okay. Pay me my money. Here is your money. - Yes. Count it. You always crib. I am coming. - Prem, this is only Rs.200. You are always paying me less. You bloody rogue! The day I get a chance, I'll take revenge! I'll put you in trouble! Idiots! "Oh, dear God.." Anju's rape and murder? Oh, my.. Prem, you are in my control now! Earlier, I used to work, you took all the money. Now you will work, and I will take all the money. Hail the Lord! What are you looking? - Nothing it's.. Nothing? It's a registry. - Registry? Yes, for me. I'd called for forms from some engineering college. Want to be an engineer? - Yes. Good. Let your result come. The education minister is my friend. You will get a seat. And yes, if anyone calls, say I have left. Okay brother. Hello, Guru. Yes Pancham? - Did you also get those letters? Who could it be who must have taken the pictures? I don't know. - Let's meet at the restaurant. Yes, I've sent them all. Yes, they are fine. Madam. Madam, had someone opened your reel? No. - Look, it is spoilt. Look, it's blank, there are no prints. How is that possible? - Whatever it is, it's before you. Looks like it caught light. Okay. - Madam, atleast pay Rs.20 for developing. Hail the Lord! You also got those photos? - Yes. Who could be blackmailing us? Who knows? Looks like we are going to land in a soup. Dear, I don't understand anything. What happened? - The roll was blank. Sir, what will you have? Two cold drinks. - Yes, alright. How many times have I told you to stop all this, but.. Shut-up! - Okay. Now tell me, what do I do with this photo? Why did you have to bring this here? - What did I do? You are always yelling at me. - You are carrying your death. Do you want to go to the gallows? Sumeet! Sumeet! What is the matter? What are you thinking? There is something wrong somewhere. Wrong? What is wrong? Hide that. Let's leave. Sir, will you have tea? Yes, get one tea. - Alright. Tear it up. Put it in this ash tray. Let's go. - Okay. It is all this idiot's fault! You make the mistake, and I should fall in trouble? Why did you have to bring the photo here? Sir, tea. Waiter. - Yes? Get me an ash tray. Why did you have to tear the photo and put it in the ash tray? You only told me to put it there. He called for the same ash tray. What now? - Gallows. The table is empty. It's not there either. Gone! Hello. - Son, liked the gift I sent you? Who are you? - Forget who I am. Against the gift, bring Rs.100000 and come to Hanging Garden. Keep the money on bench five and leave. Hail the Lord! They used to trouble me a lot. I'll make their lives miserable! Hey Chander.. - Hail the Lord! Chander, give those negatives. You troubled us enough. I don't have the negatives, Prem. I'll punch you! - You cannot compel me. I'm warning you, you'll get thrashed! Pancham, tell him. Give it. Why do you want to die in your youth? You are talking too much! - Hey, don't touch me! I'll beat you up! Give the negatives! Honestly, I don't have the negatives. Tell us quickly! Tell us! Why do you want to die a dog's death? Where are the negatives? - Speak up, old man! Old man, speak up. You ass! what have you done! Looks like he's dead. No!! Great Sumeet! While in love, you made tall claims. Was all that an act? Was it a pretense with that innocent girl? Yes, it was, but not any more. You have no right to love, you coward! How do I accept you are not a coward? Can you prove it? You will have to prove it, or how will you repay this debt? The debt of love, the debt of Anju's love. Hello. - Is Prem home? No, he's gone for a birthday party with friends. Where? - Diamond club. "This night is juvenile as the serpent.." "My body is as fire and my style is like a volcano.." "See the colors and see the youthfulness.." "This night is juvenile as the serpent.." "My body is as fire and my style is like a volcano.." "See the colors and see the youthfulness.." "My body is seductive and my moves are enticing.." "It is a bit salty and a bit spicy.." "My body is seductive and my moves are enticing.." "It is a bit salty and a bit spicy.." "Take love as well as the nectar.." "Take love as well as the nectar.." "See the colors and see the youthfulness.." "Whoever has come here has never returned back.." "He has subsided himself in soft arms.." "Whoever has come here has never returned back.." "He has subsided himself in soft arms.." "With the sharpness of my body.." "He was killed with my love.." "Look what a scenery this is.." "This night is juvenile as the serpent.." "My body is as fire and my style is like a volcano.." "See the colors and see the youthfulness.." No.. no! No.. no! No.. no! No.. no! No.. no! No. Help! Help! Help. Help me! Help! Help me! Help! Help me! Help! Help me! Help! Help me! Help! Help me! Help! Help me! Anyone there! Help! Help me! Prem was murdered. - Murdered? Who murdered him? Was the murderer caught? See the silence that spreads with our arrival. Why did you all fall silent? Were you bad mouthing us? No, about Prem.. What did you say about Prem? You are insulting Prem? What did you say about Prem? - The newspaper.. What's in the newspaper? - Prem's photo. Photo? What great thing did he do? What is it? - Prem is dead. Prem is dead? - Who must have killed him? Lorgez. Pancham. You read about Prem? - We read it in the newspaper just now. Let's go. - I cannot believe it. Pancham, Rani, did you read the newspaper? It's the same dress even in the photo. The same. Who can it be among the two? Rani! Have patience, sir. - Patience? I should be patient? A man whose young brother is dead, he should be patient? My brother has been killed, Commissioner. And you want me to sit back and watch you making inquiries? The police is doing its job. Just sealing exit points won't do. I want my brother's murderer! We have to find him. - Then find him! Just ringing telephone bells won't help you nab him. The police is all around. I am doing my best. He didn't leave behind any proof. He didn't leave behind any proof, is that also my brother's fault? I will tell the minister and shake up your entire department. I understand your feelings, sir. I request you to stay calm. We will nab that killer under any circumstances. I give you 24 hours. If you don't do something within 24 hours.. then I'll do it. - Alright sir. Hello. Hello. Is Mr. Bharghav in? - Papa and mom have gone out. Who is this? Very funny. You! - Yes, me. You guys killed my Anju. No. I didn't kill her. - No? Why did you kill my Anju? - I didn't kill her. Why did you kill my Anju? - I didn't kill her. What had she done to you? - I didn't kill her. Answer me! Help me! Hello, Rani? Mona here. I'm coming to pick you up in 10 minutes. Sumeet! Hello, Palton Road Police Station. A girl has been murdered here. - Where? Near Central library. - We are coming. Hey, move back! Hey, move back! Police department be damned! Police department be damned! Police department be damned! Police department be damned! Police department be damned! Police department be damned! Police department be damned! Police department be damned! Police department be damned! Police department be damned! Police department be damned! Police department be damned! Police department be damned! Commissioner, is this murder also linked to the earlier murder? I cannot say for sure now. Police department be damned! Police department be damned! Murders are being committed one after the other. Why hasn't the police arrested anyone yet? We are trying our best - Only trying? Police department be damned! Even the police are human. But we hope to nab the killer soon. All the murders that have been committed were of students.. that too, of the same college. - Sir. Khan, I am tired of answering the world. What reply do I give? - I'm putting my best effort. I don't want your effort, I want the killer. That too, at the earliest. Ok. - Yes Sir! Police department be damned! Police department be damned! Police department be damned! Police department be damned! Police department be damned! Police department be damned! Singh. - Yes, sir. Police department be damned! Police department be damned! Police department be damned! Only one thing stands out clearly in this case. What is that sir? The root of this chaos is buried in that college. I don't have any objection, Inspector Khan. Just ensure our college.. ..reputation is not affected. Don't worry, sir. I take full responsibility. I only want to ask a few questions from the students. You are mistaken, sir. Who you think, I am not him. I am a simple student. I have not committed this murder. I don't know the killer, nor is he my brother. Shut up. You bloody mimic. If I put you in the lock-up for one night and beat you up.. you'll forget all your mimicry and acting. Understand! I'm speaking the truth, sir. I've nothing to do with this murder. Then who does? Did Prem have enmity with anyone else? The whole college was enemies with Prem. But.. But what? - Once, because of Sumeet, Prem & Parvez had a fight. Parvez was rusticated from college. While leaving, Parvez had challenged Prem.. he will not spare him. Maybe.. Who is Sumeet? Does he live in this hostel? Sumeet is a simple guy. He doesn't live with us. And what is the other name you told me? - Parvez, sir. Parvez. You rascal, speak! Speak the truth! Or I'll crush your bones! Speak! I told you inspector, I have not committed the murder. I did not commit the murder. Singh. -Yes, sir! Who is the other guy? - Sumeet. Yes. - Prem used to trouble you a lot? Why speak ill about those who are dead? ARE dead? You mean you are also talking of Mona and Rani along with Prem. What? - That means, apart from Prem,.. ..even they troubled you. What? And getting an opportunity, you killed each one of them. Me? - Yes, you. That's an allegation. It's not true. Truth and lies will soon be known. You are trying to trap me. - No. I am telling a criminal the truth about him. I have proof. And an eye witness too. In the first two murders, very intelligently.. ..without leaving any proof, you succeeded in fooling law. But while committing the third murder, you slipped. Sir, a woman has come who says she knows the killer. Bring her here. - Please come. Hello, inspector. - Hello. The killer you claim to have seen, is he the one? No inspector, he's not the one. - Look carefully and tell me. No, he was a little fat, and tall. Anyways, thank you. You may go now. - Thank you. I am sorry Mr. Sumeet. You may go now. Thank you. - All the best. Same to you. - You are welcome. Thank you inspector Geeta, thanks a lot. But sir, how will this help you? My plan has succeeded. I have given him a false sense of victory. You? So early? What is the matter? You look upset. Sumeet had gone to the police station today. Police station? Why? In connection with investigation in the murder case. Whose murder? - The murder of college students. He is not connected with those murders. He.. I know. But.. - Who is the inspector? Wait. I met the commissioner. Bhabhi. Sumeet, did the police trouble you? - No. What is done is done. Won't anyone give me tea today? Yes Bhabhi, even I'm hungry. - I'll get it. Hey, what is the matter? Why are you upset? Nothing brother. - Don't worry, trust me. Yes. - Let's go to the table. First Prem, then Mona, then Rani. Wonder whose turn it is now. The students federation have also written to the Home Minister.. to find the killer. The police is useless. They still haven't been able to nab the killer. Madam, Business Economics. - It's taken. What? It's taken? Why are you getting so upset? Since when did you start paying attention to studies? Not me, my father. - Your father will read the book? If I fail, father will throw me out of the house. I have to pass. I have to secure my position. - Vandana has taken the book. She will return it tomorrow. I want the book at any cost tomorrow. Okay dear, you will get it. Business economics, definitely. You love to lick fingers, don't you? Now lick this poison. Madam, madam. Business economics. Keep it on the rack there. Pancham, you? In college? I've come to take a book. - Strange! Madam, my book. - It's on the rack there. Okay. This book is for me. I asked for it yesterday. Pancham, what happened? What happened to Pancham? What happened? Pancham! - What happened? Sir, Sumeet is standing there. I want to talk to you. Come. You cannot fool the law for long now. You are foolish, inspector.. to consider every shadow before you as that of the killer. You are not a shadow, you exist. Exist? Agreed I am not good at legalities.. but I can sure call law my property. I spend my mornings and nights among the players of law. You are forgetting one important thing. Proof. First find the proof, then investigate the murder. The killer and the proof is as close to me as you are. Assume you are the killer for me, and also the proof. See this uniform? I have not earned it with bribes, recommendations, buttering.. ..but with my intelligence and hard work. And I am Khan; Inspector Khan! The criminal I go after, I take him to his climax. And don't forget, it is not very long now.. ..for my hands to reach your collar! Check. Check so soon? I'll check mate you! Because I still have to eliminate a pawn yet, inspector. This game's last pawn. Sumeet, you are here. I've been looking for you. Is everything alright? - Yes. I felt like having tea, I thought we'll go together. Shall we? Come. - Okay. Sumeet. I want to talk to you. - What is it? In private. - What is it that you cannot say here? It is something private. Anita, you go to the canteen, I'm coming. Okay, but come soon. Tell me, what's the matter? Sumeet, I want to apologise to you. - Apologize? What for? I troubled you a lot. I thought I'll apologise to you before leaving. Before leaving? You are going somewhere? Yes, forever, to Mauritius. - Mauritius? Yes. I don't like it here in college now. I feel lonely. My group is gone. I am sorry, Sumeet. I am leaving, I have to pack.. and also go to Ajanta Travels in the evening. Okay bye. - Okay bye. Ajanta Travels This wound? What will I tell brother? Can't you see? You are teasing a girl? I'll thrash you! I won't spare you! Hey, what's going on? - Leave! What is going on, here? Go, go from here. Sumeet? You? What happened? What happened? Come, let's go. Sumeet. You? - Yes, me. Where are you coming from at such a late hour? I don't need to tell you that. You do, Sumeet. Answer Inspector Khan. I'd gone to see a film, brother. - Which film? Murder. - To see Murder or commit murder? I don't understand. First explain to me how you got hurt. I had a fight with someone in the theater. - Who? You don't ask names from strangers. Which theater? - Shaan. And this half ticket is proof. If you still don't believe me.. Manager, Sumeet Khanna here. Please speak to Inspector Khan. Hello. - Manager Dwarka here. Did Sumeet come to see the last show there? Yes, he did. - Did a tiff take place? Yes, a small tiff, but it's okay, I managed it. - Thank you. Sorry sir, I unnecessarily bothered you. It's okay if it happens sometimes. But if it happens always.. Right sir, I will try to ensure this doesn't happen again. Good night. - Good night. It is very late. Go to bed, Sumeet. Okay brother. Good night. Rogers! Rogers! Remember you were attacked? Someone tried to kill you. Good. Did you see that man? Properly? Look. Is he the man who attacked you? Rogers! Rogers! Doctor. Oh my God. I am sorry. He is no more. - What? Yes. Oh god. Doctor, can you do me a favor? - Yes. The news of Lorgez's death should not leak out of this room. Every ward boy, doctor, nurse connected to this ward.. has to be told that Lorgez is still not out of danger. With the operation, there are chances of his survival. Good. - Good? What good news is in the paper? Papers always carry news that's bad or of destruction. It's about Lorgez Anthony. They say he can be saved after an operation. That's very good news. Lorgez is the only eye witness, whose survival.. will ensure the arrest of the killer. Hope he survives. Take. Sir, Rs.30. You were right, sir. He has come disguised as a doctor. Let him come. Special ward. This is the one. Welcome. Welcome. The reward I give you for your obsession.. will be a lesson not only for you.. ..but for your generations to come. Drop the knife. You fool! You came to kill a corpse? Now come on. You bloody. You bloody criminal. I'll get you. I'll get you! Careful. Who is taking the ambulance? Catch him. Sumeet, stop! What I regret is that Inspector's Khan's bullet.. ..instead of hitting my leg, why didn't it hit my chest. Atleast I would die. The chance to meet Anju was also snatched from me. If truth is confession of crime.. the law has every right to punish. But behind this truth, let is also think.. ..of human relations and the pain.. that compelled a simple and innocent man to do this. I want to present a picture of this bitter truth to the court.. ..seeing which, any man in the world can lose his head. This picture shows the helplessness & defenselessness of a girl. But it does not show the painful screams of that helpless girl. It shows her defenselessness, but no way of escape. Every man's heart will shudder to see this picture. This picture is asking for justice, Your Honor. Sumeet committed these crimes, helpless at the hands of his heart. He weighed justice and injustice in the scales of emotions. Had he weighed it in the scales of law.. ..he would not be standing helpless here in the box. That's all, your honor. That's all. After due consideration of the case.. ..the court has reached the conclusion.. ..that these five murders were pre-planned. So the court declares Sumeet Khanna guilty. But considering his mental state, and his young age.. the court sentences him to life imprisonment. The boy is young too. Sumeet. Sumeet. Don't cry, Bhabhi. My Bhabhi cannot be so weak. - Forgive me. I could not.. No Bhabhi, you gave me life instead of the gallows. You have given me new life, Bhabhi. Excuse me, Mrs. Khanna. Please. Let's go. Bhabhi, take care of brother. She will take care of me, but who will take care of you? I am sorry. No brother.. no. - Sumeet. No.
