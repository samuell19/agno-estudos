This is it. You know, this is our chance. You know we won't last another winter here. The debt alone will ruin us! I just don't think it's a good idea. It's opportunity! But we have nothing out there. Here, I can get more students. Your lessons aren't going to buy us more than a cup of sugar. Millie... There's rumor of gold. Gold? Will Hutchinson. He told me there's a man who found gold in California. The mormon told you that? We need to keep this quiet. It just seems so-- Millie, I love you. You know I do. I just... We just need to do this. I don't know if I can. This is our destiny! There's something out there for you and me. For us as a family. What about my parents? I grew up here Levi. What will I tell my mother? You can't. It's our secret. For now, at least. It'll be okay. Ready? It looks like... a tall, dark... handsome soldier. Your turn! It looks like... a big puddle of coffee. Come on! Use your imagination. Christina, I have to tell you something. But, you have to promise not to tell anybody else. Especially not my parents. Levi and I are heading West. What? I don't know. I don't think it's a good idea, but I have to support him. You can't leave. You're my best friend. And, I'm his wife. You'll find a new best friend. Levi's arranged for us to tag along with a group of families leaving out of Springfield. They've organized all the supplies and they know the route. It's shouldn't take us more than a couple of months. You can't, Millie. I've heard stories. It's not safe. There are things in those woods. Stories, that's all. We will be with dozens of others. But, what if what they say is true? We will be fine. We'll be safe. What are you thinking about? The woods. Bed time already? Is everything okay? Listen... We need to have everything packed and ready to go before bed tonight. We're leaving early. Early? Not a word to anyone! We must take a wagon before anyone wakes up. I read of route that will cut weeks from our travel. We will get there long before these people. But, Levi, tomorrow's the sabbath. We're the last group on the trail this season. I can't bear to fall behind these idiots. Gotta leave as soon as possible. There will be nothing left for me. For us, Millie. You can't possibly enjoy another month of this. You know, I am really grateful to have you by my side Most of these men's wives are back in Iowa. But, you're right here. Soon, we will have everything we need. Whoa, whoa boys. Stay in the wagon. What-- Levi Oh! Wake up, Levi. Wake up. Shoo! Get away from him! Love is... Love is patient. Love is kind. It does not envy. It does not boast. It is not proud. How could you let this happen? Excuse me! Please! I need help! I can't survive out here. This isn't I'm just a housewife. I don't know what to do or where to go. Are you even listening? Give me some kind of sign. Anything. I'm sorry. You can't follow me. They'll come looking for you and they'll find me. Are you lost? Do you speak any English? Of course you don't. Deyague galame. Gumahesh mangalahe. Is this seat taken? Is that bunny rabbit? What is that? Mine looks more like a snake. That almost looks like the sun. You know... I almost stopped believing in God. I think today is Christmas. I was saving these for a special occasion. I can't think of a better one. You need to eat. Look how beautiful these are. Somebody is missing these. Do you think they will mind if we take one? I had a dress like that. No time for nostalgia We must keep moving. Come on boy. Oh my. We can't be far I bet you've never seen one of these before. Just one song. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Well, let's go. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Someday, I'll teach you. Come on, boy. Come on, boy! Hello? Is anyone here? Hello? They can't be far. Everything is in tact. We need to catch up. Don't touch them! Ah! We're going to freeze to death out here. I can't keep you alive. I don't know why you followed me. You shouldn't have! I don't know what else to do. I'm sorry. Go on, boy. Get out of here. It's over. Go! When I wake I'll be with you. What do you want? Me to just lie here until I die? Come on, boy. Look! This tree has been cut. We need to follow the sun. The sun is setting over there and that's West. We're going to cross a creek and we should be to town within a couple days. We can go two days without food, right? We're going to just keep marching toward the sun. This must be way! Yes, it is. I can hear the creek already. Once we cross this creek, we should be close Sweetwater Creek I sure hope it is. That's hardly a creek. We must have gone the wrong way. It just gets worse upstream. We're never going to cross that alive. But, we're going to have to. Tomorrow First thing. You know, this could be good for us. Getting stranded out here. I used to go to church every Sunday. Follow the good book A godly woman If you would have asked my mother. But I've never known God before Not like this. Not in my bones. Not until... You followed me I felt alone for weeks I didn't see the trees The stars The way the snowflakes glisten like diamonds in the sun's rays. I was in such a hurry to escape paradise God's masterpiece The finest church I've ever seen God isn't just in a bible or church God is everywhere I had lose everything to see that You're a really good listener. Here. This ought to warm you up. The first step is always the hardest. Come on! Well, let's go. It's all gone. Come on, boy! Well, let's go.
