Are you all right? Yeah. What do you think? Nothing, it's just... It's awkward. Stay. I would like to stay very much but I'm not going to. Come here. This is going to be one of those terrible mistakes. The ones you can't ever take back. Are there any other kind? So I never told you what happened after I dropped you off? No. So what happened? Where are you going with this? Hold on. This is very good. Can you make a left here? Wait, no, no, no. Just keep going straight. Go straight. Will you please make up your mind, sir? Wait. Just take this all the way down Ninth. Jesus. You're sure you don't want to come with me? This club is amazing on Thursday nights. Yeah, I can't. I'm going to do this, poetry slam down at Nuyorican. But you should... You should come. The poets are really sexy. Sexy poets? The girls go nuts. They faint if they hear a good rhyming. Pete, I would love to hear you do your little poem, but, the most beautiful women in New York are at this place. Come on. The club you are going to is very special. I got laid many times in this club. Come with me. I can't. Listen, they've already printed up the programs. It's a big deal. These fucking people from New Jersey don't know how to drive. Hey, I'm from Jersey. I'm sorry, sir. I have been to Secaucus. It's a very nice place. Hey, have you ever been to, Bayonne? What is it with all this traffic? I've also been to Paramus, Hoboken... It's 1:00 in the morning! People should be where they're going! They have no life, these people. They are having no life. You can pull over here on the left. That's great. I can get out. I can walk from here. Thanks. No, no, no, don't worry about it. I got it. I'll give you my number. Give me a call. Great. Um, I had a very good time doing your little commercial. All right. We'll do it again. Okay. I love New York in June. How about you? Yeah. It's October. Buddy, please drive faster. I'm sorry, sir, but I'm not getting ticket! So, when I finally got down to the club there was something strange in the air. I think it was a full moon. Yeah, blame it on the moon. I'm already sorry I didn't go. Well, hold your applause till I'm finished. I don't think I want to hear this, Dag. What's up, Dag? How goes it, Jimmy? A finer night I have yet to see. Fuck! You fucking motherfucker! What, do you think you're going to touch this? No. Warning. Warning. Danger, Will Robinson. Fucking Ferrari! Whoa, it's really fucking... You fucking motherfucker! What? Are you all right? Yeah. Broke my fucking heel. He touched my... Well, why don't you come inside? Drinks are half price. Okay. Okay. You have been warned. ♪ A little bit of you and me ♪ A little bit of set you free ♪ A little bit of ecstasy ♪ Give me what I want ♪ 'Cause what I want is what you need ♪ Give me what I want, a little bit of ecstasy ♪ Give me what I want ♪ 'Cause what I want is what you need ♪ Give me what I want, a little bit of ecstasy... ♪ Ya. Mama! Mama! Yeah! Yeah! Mama! She doesn't sound that bad to me. Peter! Wait. Big finish. Drea? You like chamomile? My name is Linda. What, is Drea like your club name? Where am I? You're in my apartment. And you are? Dag. Dog? Like you walk a dog? You don't remember me? Could you get my clothes, please? Yeah, all right... Here you go. That's not mine. Sorry. Could you turn around, please? Yeah, yeah, hey. Thank you. Hey, listen, Linda, I've got a lot of work to do today, which I have to finish today, so, I'm afraid we can't have a morning. Um, why don't you tell me what happened? Nothing. Nothing happened. We met at the bar. We drank too much. We tried, but... I couldn't hold up my end. Okay. God, I'm so embarrassed. No. Hey. Yeah. Leave your phone number, and I'll call you when you calm down a bit. I'm engaged. You can forget the phone number. Was that the guy in the Ferrari? What Ferrari? I'll walk you out. Listen, she does this. Once I found myself in Reykjavik on Air Force One surrounded by Secret Service. Bye. I can't believe you never told me that story before. I swore from then on to wake up with people who have as close to one personality as possible. At least that's one problem Rebecca doesn't have. Let's get out of here? I'm starving. Me, too. Where's my phone? It's Sunday, Dag. Yeah, but I'm waiting to hear on those Pepsi spots. Yeah, but don't turn it on. It's rude. What Pepsi? It's this great campaign that shoots in Aruba that you're too old for. Listen, go get the elevator, okay? I can be younger. Why did you do that? What? Did you have to bring up your Sybil story? Why not? Because his girlfriend just got out of a psychiatric ward. That's why not. Come on, Halley. Rebecca is crazy. She's not schizo. Just try to be a little more sensitive. Hey, I'm sensitive. Yeah. Well... Just let Peter bring it up if he wants to, okay? You know what? He's probably dying to talk about it. What? Pete is waiting in the elevator. I don't care. I'm in love with you. You know that, right? Yeah. You know, in the last two months, I... Come on. Hey, hey, hey, hey. We're bringing this up after brunch, okay? So, how is Rebecca, by the way? She's fine. She would have come today, but her mother had dibs. Yeah. Well, whenever she's up to it. Rebecca loves you guys. But, no, she's good. Recovery is a slow process. Yeah. Listen, if you don't want to talk about this, you don't have to. Cut it out. I heard you guys upstairs. It helps to talk about it, really. Yeah, see? What? I just... We care about you guys a lot. I get it. I mean, what do you say when someone tries to kill themselves? But she's not deranged, she's just very depressed. Yeah. And I think she's going to come out of it just fine. Of course. Of course. Absolutely, yeah. I'm just not so sure about us. Really? Well, she's so much younger. Yeah, she's been around. What do you mean? Well, she's been dancing since she could walk, right? Her mother's company, and traveling around the world. You know, that. I tried to kill myself when I was a teenager. You're kidding! Yeah. Show him the scars. Yep. You see these short little ones? Those are the trial ones. They don't go deep enough. They call them hesitation cuts. Right, right. P-plus, you're not sure how much it's going to hurt, so the first stroke is gentle. But then, if you're going to go through with it, you make these cuts. Yeah, well, um... Rebecca overdosed on Prozac. Rebecca! Rebecca! Rebecca, stop the lithium or the Prozac, whichever it is that has you staggering through my dances. Mother. I thought she was amazing! Who said that? I did. Um... She took my breath away. And who are you? Peter. I'm reading the Ginsberg poem during the duet. Show me your balls. What? I want to see your testicles. Why? They must be quite substantial if you think you can contradict me in front of my company. I apologize. Obviously... Hurry up! Never mind. I must have been mistaken. Now, where was I? Yes. Rebecca, you were a much better dancer when you were a bulimic. Why don't you take that up again? We could keep a bucket at the side of the stage... Peter, is it? Yeah. Rebecca? Rebecca? Rebecca! Yes? Bring him to dinner. Who? Dick, here. Willie. Peter. I'm sorry, but I have plans tonight. Please, if you can, change them. I would very much like you to come to dinner with my daughter and myself. Why do you think she did it? Well, she's never been on her own list of favorite people. But, um, she was having an affair, and that probably had something to do with it. She had an affair? Yeah. Some guy in Belgium. They met on the tour. Was it another dancer? Nobody knows who he was. She kept the whole thing secret. All her friends think I'm the best thing that's ever happened to her. Yeah. You are. Yeah, well, no medals yet. What does that mean? It's not over, she says. She's been trying to get in touch with the guy again. It still surprises me that it actually rings. So annoying. Hello? They hung up. I hate that. What is that thing? I know. It came with my Jet Set Barbie. It can only have really short conversations. "The plane, the plane." Peter, I think that you and I are the only people on the planet that don't want to be in constant contact. My God! I am so disappointed. Hey, what? It's vintage. Did you see their spot? That Speed of Light campaign? Yeah, I seem to remember not being cast in that one either. Don't start. I invented you. There wouldn't even be a Peanut Butter Eagle if it weren't for me. Yeah, I don't know whether to thank you or choke you. Nobody wants to see me in anything but feathers and a beak. No, hey, let me. But it might be Bernie with the Pepsi ad. I can answer a phone. Hello? Hey, Rebecca. We're so sorry you're not here. Yeah, yeah, Peter's here. It's Rebecca. Hey, Reb. How'd she get the number? What's going on? She wants to talk to you, Dag. Hello. I understand. Do you think that's a good idea? Okay. Halley, she wants to talk to you. Yeah? He what? No, I don't want to talk to you. All right. Peter. Yeah? I thought it was something like that. No, I won't do anything stupid. Yeah, I'll see you then. Dag showed up backstage after the performance. I didn't even know he was in Europe. He was in Paris shooting the, um... The Euro Disney spots. Right. So, this was two months ago? Right. And I was in Brussels. Is that a long trip, Paris to Brussels? It's about two and a half hours by train. Go on. We went back to my hotel room. I had two glasses of champagne, and we had sex. Did he stay the night? No, he didn't. And it was just the one time? Yes. And? And, that's it. And I'm sorry. Rebecca, what made you think that you could just come over here and tell me this? What do you mean? I don't mean to sound high school, but you fucked my boyfriend. What made you think I wouldn't knock your teeth out? I'm sorry. I'm not very good with women. Okay. Well, it's been swell, but, I've got a lot of packing to do, so, good night. You're leaving him? Yes. But I meant for this to show you how insignificant it was. I get to decide that. Well, where are you going to go? You can stay at my apartment. I'm still at my mother's. No, thanks. I appreciate the offer, but, that's impossible. No, I insist. Here are my keys. No, no, I'm going to stay with a friend. I know this is an odd request, but Halley, you're very upset right now. So, even if you take my keys as a last resort, in case all your friends are out of town, take them. My apartment is yours. All right, I'll take the keys, but I'm not going to promise that I'm going to use them. Address is on the key chain. Don't you know that's dangerous? If you lose your keys, whoever finds them can just walk right into your apartment. But if somebody good finds them, they'll know where you are. Can I help you pack? No. I would rather this hadn't happened. Hi, this is Dag. And this is Halley. We're not here now, so leave a message. No, erase that. That's no good. Don't erase it. It's fine. Hi, it's me. I get off in two-and-a-half hours. I'll see you then. You should probably think about taking her name off of your machine. A-ten-hut! All rise for the eagle! Be seated. Americans traditionally love American Classic Peanut Butter. They love the crunch of Crunchy. The smooth of Smoothy. I wouldn't give a hot-diggity-damn for any son of bitch who didn't love American Classic Peanut Butter. I love the smell of American Classic Peanut Butter in the morning. It smells like victory. American Classic Peanut Butter. The eagle knows. Want more chocolate? Can't get enough caramel? Try new Holiday candy bar. It's like taking a vacation. Coming up next, Michelle finally sleeps with Janet on Our Best Lives to Live. I shouldn't have done it. I shouldn't have seen her dance and I shouldn't have slept with her. It's been eating me up. So, I'm glad it's finally out in the open, because maybe now we can move forward. Say something. I'm going bowling. Can I come? That's good. Who's the man? That's good. Who's the man? Yeah, you're the man. Who's the man? Come to daddy, baby. Hey, no. Hey! What's going on? No... Okay, Pete, you win. Well, probably. You've only got a 14. I'm not talking about the bowling. What are you talking about? You know, whenever you're mad at me, you do this. You act like nothing happened. What do you want me to do? You know, Pete, you told me that Rebecca's mental health was fragile. I knew that she was severely depressed and that she got lonely on the road, and I still went to see her. I mean, I tried. I tried to resist, but I caved. Hello? Could you excuse us? Come on, say something. If you hit me or spit on me, I think I'd feel better. I don't want you to feel better. All right. You know, maybe this was all for the best. How? How is this for the best? Because maybe now you can have a healthy relationship and move on. I'm moving on, but I don't want to talk to you. I don't want to work with you. I don't ever want to see you again. Ooh! Yeah! See, that's more like it! That was the Peanut Butter Eagle. What? Yeah, yeah, the commercial, yeah. He's my favorite commercial actor. That's too bad he left, then, 'cause maybe you could have got an autograph. You two have a fight? No... Paula, we didn't. Sounded pretty heavy. Well, you mustn't have heard the whole conversation, then. That part about fucking his mentally ill girlfriend? , You're him, aren't you? Who? That was my role! I was supposed to be the eagle! That was going to make my career! I spit on your eagle! I spit on your peanut butter! You're a fraud! You know nothing about birds! Taxi. Go on! If you were a real bird, you could fly! Fly like me! Fly like me! Taxi! Fly like me! So, how am I dressed? Um, okay. For dinner? You're coming? Yeah. I just wanted her to have to work a bit. Hey. I meant what I said. You can flat-out dance. This is how it starts, right? What? Things between people. What do you mean? Relationships. Um... I think they start all different ways. But this might be one of them. Why don't we see how dinner goes? Can we take it back to, "You can flat-out dance"? Sure. You can flat-out dance. Thank you. I'm going to shower. You'll wait? I'll be here. Okay. That'll be $32.50. Hey, we're here. We're here now. Where? You said JFK, right? Yeah. $32.50, fuckface. All yours. Thanks a lot, buddy. What's your name? Dag. Not Dog, Dag. After Dag Hammarskjold, former secretary-general of the United Nations. You have to say that every time? Yep. Why were you named after him? He was a poet and a peacemaker. My mother admired him. Tell me one of his poems. I don't know any. If I were named after a poet, I'd read his poems. Well, I read them. I just didn't memorize any. Well, what were they about? The struggle to be human and just. Yawn. It's Stephan. Hey, Stephan, it's, Halley. Listen, um... I was wondering, if you were in town, if I could, stay over or, use your apartment or something. Um, it's a long story. Anyway, I realize that it's late, so, um, if I... If I don't hear from you in the next, um, five minutes I'll... I'll be floating in the East River. Bye. Flight 69 to Loserville, now boarding. Flight 69 to Loserville, now boarding. Once, I'm doing this dog food commercial, right? You're not an actor. God, no. I'm a director. I directed the commercial. So we got these eight German shepherd puppies. We're doing this dolly shot, right? And the dolly is... That's this big cart that we put the camera on, and, it's very heavy. And it's rolling, and, well, you know puppies. One of them gets crushed underneath the wheel. Did you tell me that just to let me know you directed commercials? Maybe. If you're trying to pick me up, you should have chosen a happier ad. I'm not trying to pick you up. So, what do you do? I waitress at a bowling alley. Is that all? I tell fortunes. Read my palm. Don't do that. I read beer rings. What do you see? Due to your rampant infidelity, and specifically due to having had sex with your best friend's girlfriend, your woman has left you and your best friend hates you. What you would like most right now, though, is to drown your sorrows in the loins of someone you hardly know. I suppose you've never been unfaithful. I've never been faithful. To anyone? I'm already contemplating fucking around on you. You're getting the wrong impression. No, I'm not. Two beers, seven bucks. Plus tip. How much for the reading? Leave your phone number. I fuckin' deserve you. Enjoy. Hi, it's me. I get off in two-and-a-half hours. I'll see you then. You should probably think about taking her name off of your machine. Rebecca? Rebecca? What... No, no, no, no. Becky? Sorry. Hello. Whoa. I'm sorry. Who are you? My name is Andre. I'm a friend of Rebecca's. Who are you? Never mind. How do I know that you're telling the truth? I have a photograph of Rebecca and myself. You can check my resemblance through the... Through the peephole here. How's that? All right. If you'll just open up the door a smidge I can slide it through the gap in the door. Okay, here we go. Don't be deceived by the glasses. I... I just had that laser surgery on my eyes, so... Are you satisfied? It's me. Listen, can I just come in for a moment? I don't very much like vestibules. All right. Thank you. I'm sorry. Who are you? I'm Halley. Rebecca told me that I could stay here for the night. Okay, well, I'm sorry. I must have frightened you. Yeah, you did. She didn't say anything about anybody coming by tonight. I often stay here when I need time alone. When my girlfriend and I have had a row, Rebecca offers me succor. Succor? Respite. Anodyne. She eases my pain. Are you sleeping with her, too? We once dated briefly, in college. Now we're simply good friends. I see. So, where will you stay? Would it be possible... It's very late, and I could stay right here on the couch. Um... We could call Rebecca for references, if you like. No, no, that's okay. It's not necessary. You can stay. On the... On the couch. On the couch. Thank you. Sorry if I... If I woke you. No, no, you didn't. I mean, I mean, you couldn't really call it sleeping. I was... This your first night here? Yeah. It's a new bed. Most people can't sleep on an unfamiliar mattress. Yeah. I'm usually constipated for the first few days in a strange locale. What? Can't shit. You know, all tightened up. Why don't you come out to the veranda? Got some antidepressants. All those without a life, please board. All those without a life, please board. You're going nowhere. You look like a man without a destination. You're very perceptive. You're the guy from the peanut butter, aren't you? Yeah. You're droll. My name is Colleen. I'm heading westward on flight 669. They're showing the new Eastwood. Come with? Hi. Hey. I brought you something. Come on. Nice antidepressants. Chocolate cake raises the spirits. It's the caffeine in the chocolate that does it. Often, it relieves constipation as well. Caffeine. Really? What do you do? I'm a videographer. And what is that? I record family histories, and then I edit them into personal documentaries. I see. And you? I teach the cello. So, how do you know Rebecca? She slept with my boyfriend. The Brussels escapade. Give me the ice cream. Colleen, the woman that I love, works for the airlines. They have courtesies in this industry that allow her to travel anywhere in the world for about the cost of a movie ticket. Once a week or so, she'll fly somewhere and back. However, before she plans her destination, she inquires about the film that's being shown. She has developed a fondness for watching movies only while aloft. Would you like some caviar? Eastwood always improves. Didn't you like it? I did. The turbulence at the end was kind of frightening. Moviegoing should always be a life-or-death experience. God, look at these poor things. It's genius. Thank you. Where did you learn how to do that? It's my life's love. You don't look like you're having a good time. I am. It'll pass. Emotions are ephemeral like flowers and beauty. When they appear, it's your duty to appreciate them. Can I... Can I kiss you? Of course. Betrayal. Lips don't count. Would you care to go further? You are sleeping with Rebecca, aren't you? Yes. I think I've lost the ability to be shocked. Hi. Hi. Shouldn't we be taking this upstairs? Buckle up, you two. We're about to land. My husband has affairs. I have affairs. You just need to find someone with similar interests. My heart is broken. I'm sorry. Hey, I don't think you can you use the phone this close to landing. It interferes with tower communications. Who's using the cell phone? Turn it off immediately. This is Rebecca Newman. He's over here! Give me that cell phone. Give me that phone! Rebecca, it's Peter. I will love you always! Mommy! Hello, Dag. Have we met? No, but you know my wife. You met her on Friday and you fucked her. Now, I'm going to kill you! No, no! I didn't do anything! Whoa, whoa, wait a second, wait a second. When you said Friday, did you mean last Friday? Yeah, last Friday. No, no, no. That was our anniversary. He couldn't have possibly fucked your wife because he was with me. Yeah. Yeah. Why would your wife say something that wasn't true? I don't know. Where is she tonight? I don't know. Well, it's none of my business. Can I get a drink, honey? Of course. No hard feelings? Yeah, no problem. Great. That could have been unpleasant. Yeah, it could have been. He's very lucky you came by. He certainly is. What's your name? Halley. What's your name? Dag. Dog? Not Dog. Dag. It's a long story. Sorry. I'm sorry. Next time, we've got to get the decaffeinated chocolate cake. Right. What's this? What? What? That's junior high school dramatics. Were things really that bad? I don't know. I guess I must have thought they were. You know, I was a little fat. Actually, I was a lot fat. Do you want to watch TV? Sure. Good. Great. Good, good. 'Cause, I like to know what's going on in the world, you know? My God. What's wrong? It's a plane crash. We are here at LAX, where investigators are already on the scene, sifting through the charred remains of the business and coach-class sections where there were no survivors. The news is much better, however, for first-class passengers, as the cabin and cockpit sheered off during impact and slid hundreds of yards away stopping, literally, 25 feet from the gate eight minutes ahead of schedule. Boy, you get what you pay for. Fortunately, the captain did survive... My God! That's Peter! Hey... And that's my Colleen. And in a bizarre twist of fate, one passenger, seen here apparently completely unharmed during the disaster, was run down by a catering vehicle... ...while celebrating on the tarmac. The passenger's name is being withheld pending notification of next of kin. Back to you, Jim. My gosh. Jesus. Just a second. There's a hot line for families. Let me just call. Let me just call before you go. Rebecca, it's Peter. I will love you always! Rebecca, it's Peter. I will love you always! Rebecca, it's Peter. I will love you always! , , , Rebecca? Excuse me. Rebecca? My God. What the hell are you doing here? Thank you. Hi. Peter keeps telling me you can dance, but I had to see for myself. Well, now you know he lied. You were amazing! You are the most... Okay. Hey, I have a bottle of something at the hotel room. I'd love to, but I can't. I got to catch an 11:26 train. Really? Yeah. Too bad. To the most unbelievably gifted dancer anyone has ever seen. Besides my mother. No. Hold it. Don't you dare drink to that. Sorry, it's reflex. I'm allergic to compliments. Your mother is a very talented woman, but without you, it would just be a lot of dancing. Now drink. Thank you. Sorry, if I... No. God. I'm so glad you're here. It is so fucking lonely. So, um, why are you in Europe? Didn't I tell you? Probably. I don't listen. I'm, shooting a Euro Disney spot. Is it nice? Euro Disney? It's okay. The best part about it is you got all these French people that are paid to be nice to you. Let's talk about something else. Okay. You speak to Peter? Could I have another glass of champagne? Yes. I see other men. What? I don't date other men, but... I sleep with other men besides Peter. Peter knows. And how does he feel about that? He wants me to stop. What a surprise. Does Halley know that you came here to see me? No. I just got on a train. Can you stay the night? What's wrong? I think I'm going to say no. I don't often do that, say no. But I think I'm going to this time. This is a bad idea. Come here. This is going to be one of those terrible mistakes. The ones you can't ever take back. Are there any other kind? You're awake. That a girl. He will love me always. Good. Rebecca, is it? That's your name? Stay awake. You hear me? We got a white male, 30s, unconscious. He's got a head injury. Looks like a mugging. His name is Dog something. Okay, we're going to send him down to East Village Memorial. Yeah. Over. Fosse fucked me at 4:00 a.m. on the Ponte Vecchio in Florence. I said to him, "I'm an old worn leather bag. "Don't belittle yourself." He said, "I want to, Jessica. "You are the most beautiful woman in the world." Total bullshit and I fell for it. Nureyev? I couldn't ever get him to try it. I got him drunk, cut my hair wore a tuxedo. Nothing. I would have strapped one on for him. That's how deeply I felt. Who else? Yes. Mr. B loved women. He was an alchemist in the bedroom. Alvin? Fast and furious, like he was. I envy that you managed to inherit your father's eyes. Whoever he was. My God, you are beautiful, Rebecca. And you can out-dance the fucking archangels but why won't you live? My God. How ugly my hands have gotten. Scaly and reptilian. Graceful, yes, but like ostrich boots. And yours are alabaster. Smooth and perfect. I will never stop loving you. How was your flight? Fine. And Colleen? She's stabilized, which is good. She's still not conscious. How are you? I'm fine. Um... Listen, I wanted to tell you that in spite of recent events I had a good time the other night. As did I. Maybe, we could see each other again sometime, when this is all settled. I don't know, Andre. I mean... Um, listen, I... Can I talk to you later? Because he's moving around. Of course. Of course. Colleen also seems to be brightening. Bye. Okay, bye-bye. I say. Does it hurt? Yes. Good. What happened? You slept with Rebecca. After that. You don't remember? I remember bowling with Pete. He left and I left. Yeah. The doctor says you're going to be fine, unless you get a blood clot that causes an aneurysm and kills you. Personally, you know I hope that you live because I want you to regret what you did for the rest of your life. I'm sorry. I fucked up. No, no, no, fucking up is forgetting my birthday. You did not just fuck up. Can we call an injury time-out? I slept with someone the other night. You what? Yeah. You know, I... I don't do that. I mean, that's not me, only now it is and I want you to know that it is your fault and I don't forgive you. Marry me. Don't you fucking dare. I already did the worst possible thing. Nothing else I do will ever compare. If we can get through this... Shh... Shh. I... I'm done. You have no right to even apologize. I have a big problem, and I'm going to get help for it. Yeah, it's too late. Hey, Hal. Could you call a nurse? Bye-bye. Well, by some fluke the first-class cabin sheered off on impact. They even let us take our carry-on luggage. And everyone else was killed? Business and coach. Wow. Were you in shock? Sure. I'm still in shock. I flew back here when I heard about you. I couldn't have done that if I wasn't still in shock. Your phone call made me sad, and this whole thing with Dag's really got me. You in love with him, Rebecca? I don't know. Sometimes it feels like love. What about me? You're the person I should be in love with. But aren't? I don't think so, no. Okay. Okay. You know I'm in love with you? Yes, I do. I'm sorry. No, it's a good thing. It's one of those good things that just feels really awful. So, what did I do wrong? You did everything right. There's nothing you can say that I haven't already said. Why don't you love me? Wow. That made me dizzy. Gosh. Gosh, maybe you should sit down. Yeah. You've been through quite a bit. Okay. Easy. God. I'm all right. Maybe we should head back. The nurses are going to get suspicious. Sure. So, how's Colleen? I think she's still in critical. How do you know Colleen? I went to school with her husband. Small world. We've been having an affair. Even while we were going out? Maybe we should go to counseling. Maybe that would help. No, I'm... I'm getting the feeling it's over. You know you like it. Shut up, bitch. Bitch. Hey. You know what room the peanut butter guy's in? Try the cafeteria. No, smarty. He's the eagle from the peanut butter commercial. He's in 407. Thanks. Are you a friend of his? Sort of. I'm going to bring him the special crash edition of Some People magazine. He's in lots of photographs. Are you heading up there? No, I was actually here to see somebody else. Dag? You know Dag? I heard he got mugged. Yeah. Is he all right? Well, um... They think he's going to be okay unless he gets a blood clot that causes an aneurysm and kills him. What room is he in? 712. Rebecca's here too, right? You know Rebecca? Yeah. Yeah. She's in, um, 924. Peter 407, Dag 712, Rebecca 924. Got it. I'm Halley, by the way. Paula. Nice to meet you. Same here. How come it says Sylvia on your badge? I'm taking her shift. Long story. Dr. Sturgis... Will you... Will you do me a favor and, um, go see Dag first? Because he was asking for a nurse. okay, you got it. Thanks. Well, you're a lucky man. You'll be fine, unless you have a blood clot which could lead to an aneurysm and kill you. So I've heard. Hello, Sylvia. Remember me? Don't tell me. Let me guess. Here's a hint. Sylvia is not my real name. Um... Bowling alley? Waitress? Sorry, no. You had a fight with the eagle. You came over to my apartment? You tied me up? We had violent sex? Almost. Are you mad because I spit on you? Because I head-butted you? I thought you were going for the rape thing. You are a very violent person. Untie me. No. I may want to come back and fuck you once the swelling's gone down. Was Peter's girlfriend a good lay? She was better than you. So, she was worth fucking over your best friend? Sure was. Sometimes I see the most beautiful thing and I just have to have it. I don't want to take care of it or own it or love it. I just want to take off all its clothes and see and feel everything that's private. And I don't even want to do it twice. What are you talking about? You're out of your fucking mind! You know that? What am I doing here? What do you live for? For days like this. How about you? Vengeance. I'm vengeful. No, I... I can't quite place the face. Maybe you could tell me or else you can come back later. I'm a little tired. You know, if this was The Flintstones... all I'd have to do... ...was knock you on the head again and all your memories would come flooding back! Shh... Hi! Where are you heading? Rebecca. You? Peter. How's Dag? He's finally resting. Hey. Hello. Remember me? No. I was your waitress at the bowling alley. Sorry, no. Well, you were in a kind of heavy thing with Dag. Yeah, I... I remember the night. I just, um... How do you know Dag? I took him home that night. Should I go? No, it's... It's okay, Sylvia. No... Paula. Paula. I know the tag says Sylvia. It's 'cause I had to sneak in after visiting hours. Isn't it still visiting hours? I'm embarrassing myself, right? The last thing you need is some kind of geek fan showing up here. You snuck in here just to see me? I love all your commercials. The peanut butter eagle just wrecks me every time. Thank you. Hello. Peter. Yeah, I know. So... Your plane crashed? Yeah. I brought you Some People magazine. You're in lots of photographs. Wow. Thank you. But you're totally fine? Well, it all sort of caught up to me. I was in, this hospital in Los Angeles but I... I think I left too soon. Yeah, 'cause of Rebecca's suicide attempt? You know Rebecca? I tried to kill myself when I was a kid. Jesus, is suicide a female rite of passage or something? Women are ten times more likely to attempt suicide and males are four times more likely to succeed so you're bound to meet more female attempters because the male attempters are just dead. And you didn't try it again? No, I'll be dead soon enough. You know, I wish someone would explain that to Rebecca. I could talk to her. It would be my pleasure. I kind of have a crush on you. Could... Could I have a date when you get out? maybe. And, you know, this could just be the way it starts. What did you say? That this could be... The way people meet... This could just be our way. Maybe. I love beginnings. After a beginning, anything can happen. Hey, kiddo. Hello. I'm a friend of Peter's. My name's Paula. Rebecca. Nice to meet you. Same. Slit your wrists? Yes. How come? I didn't want to live anymore. Why? You're fucking gorgeous. That's very nice of you. Have you ever slept with a woman? Scratch that. Would you like to sleep with me? I don't think so. Might give you something to live for. I don't think that would do it. Are you Peter's nurse? No... I met him and Dag at a bowling alley where I work. I like Peter. He's crazy about you. I know. I asked him out just now. What did he say? "Maybe." Are you serious about offing yourself or is it just a cry for help? I think I'm serious. I could be of assistance. How? I've got about 200 sleeping pills. Go for it. So... How come you don't want to live? I make too many mistakes. Everybody makes mistakes. I try to fall in love and I choose men who aren't good to me. I try to fall in love with a man who is and I have no feelings for him. I fail at the simplest interactions between people. You're doing okay right now, with me. Sure, but, you know... Look what's going on here. Well, what is it that you want? I want it not to hurt when I wake up in the morning. When was the last time it didn't hurt? The first time I had sex with my shrink. That's a lot, don't you think? Well, you really ought to be sure this time otherwise people will stop taking you seriously. Thanks. I tried to kill myself when I was a kid. Why? My foster family were Satanists and I was supposed to be the devil's bride or human sacrifice or something. A long story. I hope you get what you want. You, too. Thanks. Maybe I should have tried it. Too late now. Hey, Halley. Peter. How are you? I'm a mess. Yeah. Weren't you just in a plane crash three days ago? Was that me? Have you met Andre? We haven't met, but Rebecca's spoken about you. I'm sorry we couldn't have been introduced under more pleasant circumstances. How's Rebecca? She's still in a coma. The doctors tell me it could last several days or several years, or she could just die. I'll stop by and visit her. She won't know you're there. How is Colleen? She's still in the hospital in Los Angeles. She's had complications. Why aren't you by her side? I, I flew back to... To be with Halley during this difficult time. You left your wife in critical condition? You're married to her? Wow. You never told me... Whoops. ...you were married to her. What difference could that possibly make? I'm here right now to be with you. It makes a whole hell of a difference. Shit! Excuse me. What? Why did you do that? What? You deliberately tried to hurt me. That. Because you've been sleeping with Rebecca. I advise that you stay out of my affairs. You stay out of them. Don't get lippy, and don't point... Lippy? Jesus! Shut up. It's a wake. Dag is dead. Jesus. I'm sorry, Halley. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. But the irony here is that, just before the crash before I knew anything about you and Rebecca your wife and I fucked in one of the little bathrooms. Well, actually, in first class they're quite roomy. I'll kill you! Yeah? Come on! Hey, Hal. Andre, I'm so, so sorry. If there's anything I can do to help. I'm sorry. Do you want to be alone for a few minutes? Yes, I would. We're going to go back to our place. Mine and Dag's. Mine. We have plenty of leftovers. All right. Thank you both. You're welcome, Peter. Thank you. Take care of yourself. Do me a favor? Don't die in the next few days. You either. So long, Peter. Hey, Peter. Paula. Hello. I'm sorry about Rebecca. Yeah. How are you holding up? Not well. Everyone I know is dead. I heard about Dag. Yeah. And Colleen. You knew Colleen? Well, Andre and I used to date, so... One potato, two potato, three potato, four. Did you know that the day you visited me in the hospital was the day Rebecca overdosed? You're kidding. Did you go and see her? Yes. I went and I tried to convince her to live like we talked about. What did you say? I told her that you loved her and she said she knew and that she loved you, too. Not enough, I guess. You want to get out of here? Let's have a cup of coffee. I would like to talk with you. Sure. Okay. Come on. But I want... What? I want to kiss her good-bye. Okay. Go ahead. It seems... Yeah, but... How does it feel? Like lips. Only less so. 50, 60, 70, 80. Yeah, that's good. You okay? No. Come on, let's get out of here. You know what? I'm... I'm going to say no. You want to stay? No, I want you to go without me. I don't want to see you again. Why? I'm not sure. But I think all I have left is instinct. I'm disappointed. You're disappointing me. I'm sorry. I think maybe my timing's been off. Let's try again in, like, a week. No. Okay. Sometimes these things just don't work out no matter how much trouble you've gone through. Watch your back. What? You take good care of yourself. Can we take it back from, "You can flat-out dance"? , To the most extraordinary dancer I have ever seen. Drink down. Could I have another glass of champagne? Would red wine do? Okay. I see other men. What? I sleep with other people when I'm on the road. You don't do that? Rebecca, I think... Do you have to work tomorrow? I can be late. Good. What's wrong? I think I'm going to say no. I don't usually do that, say no. But I think I'm going to. Even an idiot can see this is a bad idea. Okay. Goodbye, Rebecca. I'll see you in New York. Okay. Dag, how come you didn't tell me that you saw Rebecca dance in Brussels? Um... It was during that whole crazy Disney thing. I never told you about that? No. She was magnificent. Pete, did you see her dance on that tour? Of course. In Montreal. Yeah. You never told me that you saw her dance. Yeah, yeah. She blew my mind. I know why he didn't say anything. Rebecca... Why? You mean kissed, kissed? Yeah. Why? We had wine. It was late. She kissed me twice. Excuse me, please. Thank you. But anyway, I got up and left. It was a bad idea and I left. And I apologize but, you know... Nothing happened. Gee, where's the medal of honor? I thought we were through with this bullshit, Dag. We are. Didn't you hear her? I can't believe you! I'm sorry, Pete. Fuck you, you're sorry! Wait a minute. Hey, she kissed me. It's not her fault! She's got a problem! It was my fault. I kissed him. Okay, Pete? I wanted him to stay. Rebecca... But he wouldn't. Maybe we should go. I'm sorry, Pete. We'll talk. Come on. Halley. It was two lousy kisses. Tell me the truth. You thought about staying. It was the strangest night of my life. It was like I was there but I wasn't there. Please. But I swear to you when I walked out of that hotel room in Brussels, I was a changed man. And I know it sounds ridiculous that that one night could have such a profound effect on me, but it did. I don't think it was a good sign that you were making out with my best friend. You deserve better. Yeah. So what should we do? I don't think we should date anymore. So this is how it ends, right? Still friends? Yeah. So, do you want to fuck? I shouldn't have done it. I shouldn't have gone to see her dance and I shouldn't have kissed her. And you should've told me so I didn't have to find out in an elevator full of neighbors. You're right. And I apologize. Do you forgive me? I don't know how you've managed it but somehow, I'm actually pleased that all you did was make out with your best friend's girlfriend. Marry me. What are you doing? I'm proposing. Because you feel guilty. No, because I love you. Are you serious? As an aneurysm. Where did that come from? I don't know. What do you say? Do you have a dollar? What? Give me a dollar. Thank you. Can I kiss you? Of... Of course. Thank you. You're welcome. Hey, she kissed me. Ooh! Colleen. Now we're even. What? Let's start from here. Whoa! Hey, I'm sorry. Are you all right? Yeah. Asshole. Who was that? No clue.
