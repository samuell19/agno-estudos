[instrumental music] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [instrumental music] [music continues] - Goodnight, John. - 'Goodnight.' I thought the bedroom scene tonight was brilliant. - 'Did you?' - Oh, yes. I did. Didn't you think it went well? I thought it went brilliantly. Wouldn't tell you if it wasn't so. Not at all. Wouldn't tell you if it weren't so. What great foolishness do we not subject ourselves to? Between us and the meanest victims of the Gods there's little to choose. Little to choose and that of little rank were I'm not bound off, and bound I know not where. Sure went well tonight. Yes, I think it did. They were very bright. Yes, they were. It was.. ...an intelligent house. Didn't you feel? Yeah, I did. I did. - They were very attentive. - They were acute. Yes, I thought they were. Perhaps they saw the show tonight on another level. A what? Another plane, you know what I mean? - I'm not sure that I do. - A plane of meaning. Ah, a plane? I felt perhaps they saw a better show than the one we rehearsed. What are you doing tonight? - What am I doing now? - Yes. - Going out. - Oh! - For dinner. - Yes. Oh, would you hang this up for us please, huh? (John) 'Do you know I haven't had an appetite in several days?' Well, we've opened now, eh? It, it almost makes me feel as if.. Yeah. As if? As if what? I was going to say as if I had earned the right to eat. I'm not sure that I.. What did you mean? - Show like tonight's show. - Yes? - Going out there? - Go on. Makes me feel fulfilled. Ha ha ha! It can do that. - I liked your scene. - You did? - Yes. - Thank you. Which scene? The courtroom. - You liked that? - Yes. Well, I thought it was off tonight. - You didn't. - Um. Yeah. Well, wasn't off to me. No, it did not seem off to me. Well, I thought it was off. If you were, you didn't look it. - No? - No. - The doctor's scene. - Oh, yeah. - It may have been a trifle.. - Yeah? - May have been a trifle.. - Yes, say it. What? - The doctor's scene was what? - Brittle. You found it brittle? - Well, I could be wrong. - I trust your judgment. No, no. I could be wrong. - Uh-huh. - I've been out of sorts. My eating habits haven't been.. You know, sometimes when you haven't eaten-- You found it brittle. Perhaps. I may have found it so, a bit. - Overly brittle? - No. Not necessarily. The whole scene? No, no. Not the whole scene. No. - What then? - A part. I hope you would tell me if you found the whole scene so. Well, it's only an opinion of a portion of a scene. In the last analysis, we are talking about a word. Yeah. - Sorry if I sounded-- - Not at all. (Robert) 'I value your opinion.' Young people in the theatre. Tomorrow's leaders. Yes. Both of us or was it only me? - You? - Mm-hmm. You? Of course not. You were superb. Didn't I say that? - Why-- - She was off. - You felt that too? - How could I not? Yeah, I know. You felt that. - I did. - Oh, specifically tonight? Perhaps tonight especially. Oh! Especially tonight. Hey, it's a marvel you can work with her at all. - Work with her so well. - You do the best you can. It's enviable. The show must go on. I find much in it I must admire. - Uh, thank you. - Not at all. Well, you have a job to do. You do it by your lights. You bring your expertise to bear, eh? Your-your sense of.. ...rightness, fellow feeling, etiquette, huh? These are the tools that one brings to bear. Procedure. - It's quite inspiring. - Oh, thank you. - The mugging is what gets me. - Hmm. Stilted diction, the pregnant pauses, I can live with. The indicating, the mincing, these are fine. - I can accept them. - Yes. But mugging! It rots my heart to look at it. - I know. - There's no soul, no humanism. - No fellow feeling. - No. I'd like to kill the bitch. God, that she should be allowed to live. No, not just to live, but to parade around the stage. And be paid for it. I totally agree with you. She'd make anyone look brittle. You bring me the man, capable of looking flexible. The moment that she or those of her ilk walk on that stage. - I can't. - No formal training. Uh, no sense of right and wrong and.. - No. She exploits the theatre. - She does. She capitalizes on her beauty. Hey. What beauty? Her attractiveness. It isn't really beauty. No. - Beauty comes from within. - Yes. I feel it does. She trades on it. Yeah, well, she'll find out. The harshest tribunal of all, convened upon a silvered glass. Oh, why, why do you bring this action, you who.. (John) It's a marvel you can work with her. It's no marvel, John. You learn, huh. Control and character. A sense of right and wrong. - I tune her out. - Hmm. When we're on stage, she's not there for me. [laughing] How'd you like the table scene tonight? - I loved it. - The scene was fun tonight. [laughing] Thank you. I wanted to be there with you tonight. - You wanted to be with me? - Yes. - Did you? - Yes. Where? - Up there? - At the table? You wanted to be up there around the dining table or on stage? - Uh, I-I-- - Around the dining table. - Yes. - Oh, yeah. That scene was heaven tonight. - Yes. - Ha ha! The audience. Yes. Oh, that scene was.. It was a little play. It was a poem. - Yes. - It was like a little.. A walnut. - Yes. - Yeah. - How you do you mean? - You know. No. Well, it was, I mean it was uh, meaty. - Yes. - Meaty on the inside. Yes? And tight all around. And that, and mark that you heard it here first, okay, boy? - That is superior theatre. - Yes. Where'd you say you're off to tonight? - Now? - Yeah. - I was going for dinner. - Oh. I've been feeling like a lobster. - Oh! - All day. Oh, shellfish, I can't eat it. - No? - No, my weight. Having trouble with your weight? Oh, yes, always, constant fight. But you're trim enough. - You think so? - Absolutely. Makes it all worthwhile, doesn't it? [laughing] What're you up to this evening? - Now, you mean? - Yes. - Now? - Yes. Aha! I thought I might go home and read. Maybe take a, I don't know, walk. Ah! - Why'd you ask? - No reason. Just asking. Yeah, I thought I'd take a walk. Why'd you ask me that? No reason at all. Unless you'd like to join me for a snack. A snack? Oh, no, I couldn't really eat. Some coffee then? I could use the company. Tell you what, I'll walk with you a ways. You have some make-up on your face. - Where? - Behind your ear. I'll get it for you. - Did I get it on my coat? - No. - I didn't get it on my coat? - No. Hmm. Oh, good. Good. Thank you. "The Elephants Graveyard." No, colonel, though you searched night and day. My father had that fantasy and he died of it. No, you don't have to stretch the father. - No? - No. Thing speak for itself. For no man knows where those noble beast seek their final rest. [instrumental music] (Robert) 'I'm famished.' [music continues] - Your hat. - Thank you. - It's like an oven in here. - Hmm. - Your hat. - Right, thank you. My hat. My hat. My hat. - Eh? - Hmm. [mumbling] [screeching] (John) 'They say you never hear the one' 'that's got your name on it.' (Robert) 'Calm down.' - Those bastards. - Yeah. Stuck him on the wire and left him there for target practice. [explosion] - Dirty, dirty bastards! - Yeah. He had a home. He had a family. - Just like them. - Yeah. He thought he was going home. Oh, relax, we'll all be going home. Last day. Johnny, on the last day. That's the breaks, kid. Poor Mulrooney. (John) 'Goes to raise the lousy flag' 'the Jerry's cut him down like wheat.' [explosion] Johnny.. ...two more hours and we're going home. And those bastards went and cut him down. That's the breaks. No. Not by me. Uh-uh! Not by a long shot. [explosion] What are you doing? Hey, hey, hey! What are you doing, Billy. [explosion] Billy! (John) 'You hear me, Heinies!' This is for Axel P. Mulrooney! Corporal A.E.F from Dawson, Oklahoma! You hear me? It's not over yet! Not by a long shot! You hear me, Heinies! [gunshot] [gun firing] [bells tolling] Well, that looks like the end of it. [applause] Ha! Oh! Thank you. [applause] [instrumental music] [applause] [music continues] [music continues] [sighs] Oh, oh, oh! Oh, keep your point up, will you? Keep your point up. Just keep your point up. You know, when we're down left. When we're down left. Just before the head cut. You've been getting lower every night.. Look here. I'll show you. I'll show you. - I'm sorry. - Quiet alright. Quiet alright. Here we go. Let's just get it right, get it right. Thrust! Do your see? Thrusting low. A-And at last. - Ha! - Thank you. No, no, no! One more time. Please. For character. One more time. One moment, please. Just.. But fly my liege and think no more of me! (Robert) 'And cut.' That's good, that way it doesn't get in line of my face and become warm blood on the stage. [laughing] Knock on wood. Stage will do. Ha, good boy. Come fly my liege. Think no more of me a trifle a momentary whim. A rodomontade. This pantomime of fealty. Oh, they don't write them like that anymore. - 'Oh, yes! Oh, yes! Oh, yes!' - 'Sorry.' 'Isn't it strange that people will spend time' 'and money on their face and body and are content' that their voice classes them with shop girls and sheep herders. - Sound. - Yes. The crown prince of phenomenon. To me an ugly sound is an extension of an ugly soul. I do not, I do not like them. I do not like ugly sounds. I don't like folk that make them. You think that's harsh, don't you? - Not at all. - You don't? I know I seem strange about this. It's a peeve of mine. To me it's like an odor. Sound it emanates from within, do you see? Sound and odor germinate within, are perceived within. - Do you see? - No. All I'm saying is that it comes from within. Sound comes from within, you see? Ha ha ha! When I was young, John. When I was young.. ...my voice was strong. But it was raspy. - No. - Yes. It was raspy, it was. (Robert) 'And I cherished it. I was vain.' 'I felt that my vocal quality, a defect in effect' was a positive attribute. A contributory portion of my style. [laughing] Oh! - 'What is style?' - 'What? Style?' - 'There's nothing.' - 'No?' (Robert) 'Style is a paper bag.' It's only shape comes from it's context. Ooh! However, I was young, I made a fetish of my imperfections. Not a common fault, maybe a universal fault. Which nonetheless, I was guilty of 'and which now makes me blush.' 'On the other hand, do you see on the other hand' we must not be afraid of process. What? Of growth. We must not become second class citizens whose only desire is to please. We have the right to learn. I think so. That's my point. Did you get it, see? I, uh, the vowel. The vowel's not as quite as high as you render it. Work on that and it will work for you. Support your voice and it will support you. (Robert) 'Work on your voice.' 'Work on your voice.' Red leather, yellow leather, red leather, yellow leather. Deliver the letter, deliver the letter the sooner the better. As with all things. Peter Piper picked a peck of.. She sells sea shells by the seashore in the sea shells. [piano music] May I have a tissue please? Good evening. - Yeah. - How are you this evening? How am I? Uh, tight. A little tight. I feel a little.. It's gonna be a vibrant show tonight. - I feel coiled up. - Hmm. (Robert) 'I don't feel tense.' - No? - Nah, I never feel tense. Well, almost never feel tense, on stage. I feel ready to act. That's a lovely brush. - This? - 'No, the quarter inch.' - This one? - 'Yes.' - 'Is it new?' - It's an eighth inch. - That's an eighth inch? - 'Yes.' Well.. Awfully splayed, don't you think? No. (Robert) 'A little bit splayed?' No. Well, it's not new. Is it new? No. I've had it a while. A long while? (John) 'Yes.' Oh! What is it, camel? Sable. Sable brush, ooh! Oh, you keep your things well. (Robert) 'Anybody ever told you that? You keep your things very well.' It's one of the things that first impressed me about you. You take excellent care of your tools. Oh! Hey, John, may I ask you something? - Of course. - Could you do me a favor? What? - In our scene tonight. - Yes? - Umm.. - What? Could you perhaps...do less? - Do less? - Yeah. Do less what? Well, you know. You mean.. What do you mean? Well, you know. You mean that I'm walking on your scene? Oh, it's just a thought. I added aesthetic consideration. I just thought that if you did less.. Yes. Uh, you know.. - If I did less. - Yes. Thank you for the thought. I don't think you've the be like that. - I'm sorry. - Are you? I accept the comment in the spirit in which it was, I'm sure, intended. It was intended in a spirit, John. I know it was. How could it be intended otherwise? - It couldn't. - Well, you know it couldn't. Yes, I know. You know, it hurts me when you take these things personally. They.. Oh, my God! - What? - My zipper's broken. - You want a safety pin? - I have one. - Want me to get the women? - No. Thank you. Ugh! I will manage. Ah! - Sure? - Yes. - You don't want the woman? - No, I do not want the woman. Thank you. No. - You want me to pin it for you? - No. - I'll do it. Let me-- - No! I'll get it. - Ah. - Oh, come on, I'll do it. Come on. Get up here. Come on. Get up. Give me the pin. Come on. [indistinct chattering on speaker] (John) 'Oh, no! That's it.' Give me the pin. - Come on, give me the pin. - Yeah. 'Oh! Come on!' Oh, Christ! Come on. - Got another one? - No. And it's not wan, it's one. Now will you please come.. There. Hmm. Stand still now. We can't do it unless you stand the hell still. (Robert) 'Put it in, just put it in!' (John) 'Hold on a moment.' (Robert) 'I have got to get on the stage!' Alright, alright. You know, I think you're gaining weight? Will you stick it in. 'Come on, come on!' There. [instrumental music] (Robert) 'Thanks a lot.' [music continues] [mumbling] - Good show. - What? - Good show. - Oh, yeah. Perhaps you feel it harsh, I do not. I always felt we were friends. I know you have, so have I. I feel there's some common ground I feel our interests are similar. No, not identical but similar. Certainly negotiable. Uh.. (Robert) 'I've always thought so.' Yes, so do I. Well, I feel that.. This matter certainly can be settled to our mutual satisfaction. Yes, I'll have my girl look into it. Uh, not at all, not at all. The very same to you. Goodbye. (Robert) 'Forgive me, David.' Not at all, I've just been admiring the view. Yeah, lovely, isn't it? I should think one would get used to it. Well, it's been 13 years and I haven't seemed to do so. - Thirteen years? - Yeah. It's funny you know, how things attain the force of habit. Force of habit. Yes. - Take me and Jillian. - Yes. Is that what you've come to talk to me about? [phone buzzing] Hold all calls. Please. Is there something wrong between you and Jillian? Jillian's going to have a baby. Why, this is marvelous. How long have you known? - Since this morning. - How marvelous! - It isn't mine. - It's not? - No. - Uh. Oh! Well, I've always supposed there was something one said in these situations, but I don't feel.. Well, do you know? That is, have you been told who the father is? - Yes. - Really? Well, who is it? - David? - It's you, John. - Me? - You. - No. - Yes. - How ridiculous! - Is it? - You know it is. - Do I? - Yes! - Oh, John! John, John, John, John, John! I think I'll have that cigar now. I think I'll join you. She told you that I was the husband? No. She told you that I was the father? What are we going to do about this, John? I don't know, David. You could, I suppose, you could do me some physical damage. Or we could discuss this as gentlemen. Which would you prefer? Which in the end is more civilized, John? I don't know, David. I don't know. [phone buzzing] I asked you to hold all.. Perhaps you should take this one. [chair creaking] Vicious little leaches. Sots! Oh, you bloody boors. - 'Who?' - All of them. All of them! - 'Whom?' - All of them. - All of whom? - What? - 'All of whom?' - You know, all of them! The bloody sots. (John) 'What about them?;' Why can they not leave us alone? - 'Well..' - What? Yes. I said, yes. As you jolly well should say. As you should, lad because you have to pick a camp in this life. 'Oh, yes, yes. You must indeed.' You must, you wish for their praise that is to wish for death. To wish for death! The swine! [instrumental music] [music continues] [music continues] Roll up. Roll up I say, roll up. What did you think the wonder working God who in his wisdom sent down aches and pains would not dispatch the beans of their alleviation. Hmm? Oh, well.. [instrumental music] [bell tolling] [bell tolling] [John humming] What is that? The thing? Yes. We did it at school. Yes, we all did it at school. "Over the heather and over the Lee "jolly, jolly minstrels we. "A life of play and jollity, you shall enjoy come he. "For bear for bear for a life of care. "Is all you will find waiting there." I love that bit. - That was my favorite bit. - Uh, uh. "To error and to poverty. "You shall be lord for she." - Did it at school. - Yes. Did you play, "The Whatchamacallit?" "The press gang of the muse, are they who thrive by night and sleep by day." "Decide, decide for the ebbing tide." Yes. I know that it comes later, you know. - Hmm. - I was just saying it. Oh. - No offense. - No. We did it at school too. I'm, I'm sorry. And I played "The Whatchamacallit." I'm sure that you did. You can be sure that I did, because I did. Press gang of the muse are they? And did you have the.. The pirate come out of the barrel there? Yes. - Always love that bit. - Mm-hmm. I suppose it's traditional. It ain't nothing to suppose, huh. Sore throat and chicken soup. The whale speaks, the gong rings twice and the pirate comes out of the barrel. (Robert) 'Oh, oh, the autumn, eh.' (John) 'Oh, the autumn. Oh, the autumn.' (Robert) 'Yeah. Autumn weather.' (Robert) 'Yeah.' Oh, for the sun. Uh, will you, please hand me my robe. Your lap robe? Ah, yes. My mom says, just one more day. Uh. One more day yet another week. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, would you please close the window. What? I'm sorry. Do you feel a draft? Slight draft, yes. - Shall I close the windows? - Would you mind? - Not at all. - Uh, uh.. [dramatic music] I love this window. 'Thank you.' 'Oh, this room..' 'This room.' (John) 'We could just leave this afternoon..' (John) 'Just call and have the carriage brought around.' 'Just leave this afternoon.' Much too cold. (John) 'Throw two shirts into a bag, a scarf.' (Robert) 'The roads.' Meet the train. Venice. Much too cold. Would you like a glass of tea? Thank you, yes. I like this room. Yes, so do I. I always have. So have I. I'll ring for tea. Thank you. [dramatic music] Uh. [humming] [humming continues] Uhh. Got a match? Alright. Good. "One day blends in to the next." I'm not gonna do the accent, huh. - Yes. - Uh, good. "One day blends in to the next." "Scorching sun, shimmering moons" "salt, salt water." "It'll rain soon." Salt, saltwater. Uh. - I'm sorry, what? - No, I was just thinking. Salt, saltwater, it's the thought. He gives us the thought there. - Oh. - Salt.. Sweat. His life flows out. - Then, saltwater. - Yes. - To the sea. - Yes. Yeah. Alright. Okay. Yes, salt, saltwater. "One day blends in to the next. Salt, saltwater." "It'll rain soon." "Rain? What do you know about it? "I've spent my whole life on the sea. "All I know is the length of my ignorance which is complete. "Sunny, my ignorance is complete." "It gotta rain." Oh, the motif. He takes the descant through the scene, "it's got to rain." You look at it, he does it through the whole play. - Oh, well. - Oh, well. [horn blaring] [horn blaring] [horn blaring] By the sea.. 'The harsh mistress..' 'Like all women scorn she will have her revenge.' 'But Johnny, what about me?' 'What about the rest of us?' You had an audition this afternoon? Um, join me. No, join you, no. You're working, I'll let you work, though. - You had an audition, huh? - 'Yes.' Ah, how did it go? 'Well, I thought.' They were receptive. How did you feel? 'I felt good. They liked it.' Oh, that's nice. 'I thought so.' That's very nice. 'There's two classes of phenomenon.' 'Those things that we can control' 'those things one cannot.' Hmm. You can't control what people think of you. - No. - It's up to them. You know, they maybe glum. They maybe out of sorts. Perhaps they are neurotic. - What are you having, the Soup? - Uh, of course. One can control however.. One can control one's own actions, huh? One's intensions. Would you pass the bread back? That is the only thing that one can control. Please pass the bread. You're eating bread? - Yes. - Oh. Here it is. that would not signify that you aren't a good actor. No. I think I know that. Yeah. I think perhaps you do. I'm glad they liked you though. 'Thank you.' You think, they're gonna hire you? I don't know. I hope they do. 'I hope so too.' Be nice for you. Yes. Good things for good folk. Thank you. Good things for good folk. Your worship. Sweets to the sweet and happiness to men of good will though the book might have it otherwise. And Godspeed you this many a day until that peccant sun. Lost in, uh.. Peccant sun lost in.. That peccant...sun.. "Hid in the murky gloom raised by your sorrowful depart." Yes, yes, yes. Ba-ba-ba.. "And how with the country this long time "and the government? Who asks? "A friend to these shores. "By what surety?" A steadiness of gaze and speech, if that suffice you? And if not? If not? [instrumental music] Perhaps this emblem stands my pledge.. No. No, oh, oh.. Stand. Stand up, man. Have no need for tears. Come. Come, let me comfort you. [music continues] Make-up table. Artificial light. Scent of powder. Tools, sticks, brushes. Tissues, cold cream, greasepaint. Greasepaint, what is it, huh? Cream based, coloring, textures, smell, color, analyzer. What have you got? Meaningless component part. You probably could say the same thing about anything else. Mix and package it, affix a label. Put it on a make-up table a brush or two.. Robert! Would you please shut up? Am I disturbing you? You are. Enough to justify this breach of etiquette? What breach? What etiquette? - Oh, John. - 'Yes?' When one has been in the theater as long as I. Can we do this later? 'I feel there's something here of worth to you.' - Oh, you do? - Yes. Well.. Alright, you know your attitude, John, it isn't of the best. It isn't it. It just isn't. - 'Isn't it?' - No, in short. My subject is form. Form, John. The theater is a closed society. Constantly abutting, your thoughts, the feelings the emotions of our colleagues. 'Sensibilities.' 'Bodies, forms evolve.' And etiquettes. In our personal relations with each other in our personal relationships. Hmm. One generation sows the seeds it instructs the-the proceeding.. That is to say the following generation from the quality of its actions. Not from its discourse, John, no. But organically. Organically, do you get my drift? 'You can learn a lot is what I'm trying to say.' You can learn a lot from keeping your mouth shut. - You can? - 'Yes.' Oh, perhaps this is not the time to speak of attitudes. - Before we go on? - Yeah. Yes, what is life on stage but attitudes. - What? - Damn little. May I use your brush? Yes. One must speak of these things, you know, John or we'll go the way of all society. Which is what? Take too much for granted, fall away, and die. On the boards, or in society at large there must be law, there must be reason and there must be tradition. I'm sorry that I told you to shut up. Oh, you don't buy me off that cheaply. - No? - No. Would you pass me the cream please? Certainly. Here is the cream. Thank you. [cheering] The people cry for truth! (in unison) Yes! The people cry for freedom from the vicious lies and slanders of the ages. The lies, that slanders of the body and the soul and the heart cries out. The heart cries out! Memory tells us man has always lived in chains. Always lived in chains! Bread, bread, bread the people scream! (in unison) Bread! Bread! Bread! We drown their screaming with our heads in cups. In books, in newspapers. Between the breasts of women, in our work. Enough! A new day arises! [all cheering] Those who would connect with yesterday for succor will be left behind. Their souls are in the histories their heads on pipes around the buildings of our government. Now.. Now, we must look ahead. We look ahead! Our heads between the breasts of women. Plight our troth. to a security far greater than the rank of mere fortune. We must dedicate ourselves to spirit! To the spirit of humanity! To life! To the barricades! [all cheering] [instrumental music] [music continues] One day blends into the next. One day and then the next. Scorching sun, shivering moon. Salts. Saltwater. (John) 'It'll rain soon.' (Robert) 'Rain?' 'What do you know about it?' 'I've spent me whole life on the sea' 'the only thing I know is the length of my ignorance.' Which is complete, sonny, my ignorance is complete. It's gotta rain. Tell it to the marines. If it doesn't rain, I'm goin' off me nut. Ju-just take it easy, lad. What you don't want to do right now is sweat, believe me. We're never getting out of this alive, are we? How do you want it? Give it to me straight. Kid, we ain't got a chance in hell. But you know what? You shouldn't let it get you down. 'Cause that's what the life on the sea is all about. That's the gamble, lad. It's why we signed on, eh? (John) 'Can I tell you something?' - Shoot. - You're full of it. I mean it. Don't tell me about men in the sea because that's been out of the picture for years. If it ever existed. No, probably it did. Back in the days when a man had a stake in his ship. Or a stake in himself. Now.. Now.. We're dying because some black bastard ship owner in Newport decided that rather than build his ship safe for men.. ...it was cheaper to over-insure them. That's why we are dying. [all gasp] Oh, God. [foghorn blaring] Danny! A ship. Oh. A ship! Ah. [foghorn blaring] A ship, a ship. Yes, as they said. [instrumental music] As if it were, uh, a cry of some tortured.. Now, that's overblown. It's not a cry of torture, it's a.. ...a cry of, of.. ...of consciousness, isn't it? How different is.. How different is that fellow's position from my own? (John) 'From.. Sorry.' [music continues] ...from anybody's. The phrase until my ship comes in.. Now, we in show business have a special liking for that phrase. We all believe it. We all, if we were to reason it backwards.. ...might perceive that we feel stranded. [indistinct chattering] (Robert) Ephemeris, ephemeris, eh? What? Ephemeris, ephemeris. What are you saying? (Robert) Time passes. What comes after, "the men all got together, ma'am and we kinda thought you'd like to have this?" She says, "thank you." I'm aware of that, I think. After that. What comes after that? - Your line? - 'Yes.' Ah. Have you got a script? What would I be doing with a script? I'm going to get a script. 'Wait! Wait!' - I know the line. - What? Uh...after you give her the watch, right? - Right. - Right. You give her the watch. You give her the watch. - And? - Oh, Christ. You give the slut the watch "now, ma'am, we all kind of thought maybe.." "The men all got together ma'am." Oh, Christ, how ridiculous.. And what's her line? Thank you. Oh, well.. You better get a script. - You want me-- - Shh. Shut up, I'm trying to hear my cue. What's happening? I think I missed my cue. I think I missed my cue! But what's happening? Can you see? I'm going on. - Huh? - I'm gonna go on. - Oh! - What do you think? - What do you think? - Uh.. Christ! I'm going on. You want me to get a script? I missed my cue! I missed my cue! Get on out there then. Go on! Ms. Wilcox. Ms. Wilcox, ma'am. The men.. Uh.. (John) 'The men all got to..' Ms. Wilcox, as you know the men who always was fond of your husband.. ...fond of his.. As if he was a.. I think I hear my horse outside. Um, would you pardon me a moment, Ms. Wilcox? [indistinct chattering] Everybody wants a piece, eh? They all have got to get their piece. I'll wait. We spend out adult lives, bending over for incompetence. All the Ten Percenters. Agents, producers business managers, sweet heart unions. They're all in the same bed together. All the bloody leaches. [indistinct chattering] The robbers and the cenotaph. - Did you ever do that play? - What? - The robbers and the cenotaph. - Hello. Who are we if.. Yes, I'm holding for Ms. Erinstein. ...if we cannot talk to each other. What do we have in life except out fellow workers? If we don't have that what do we have? Who can talk our language? What of talent? What? Talent? Yeah, what is it? When you see the brightest fall, eh? What of humanity? I know, I'm on the phone. - Hello, Bonnie. - I give you Stanislavski. John. How are you? We enslave ourselves. No. Yes, uh.. Oh, thank you, thank you very much. Oh, on the, on the film? Yes, yes. Let me check my book. Oh, oh, some acting. Yes, 11 is fine. Wonderful, I'll see you there. Film, film, film. As the old horse said, another great profession ruined by amateurs. Am I keeping you? You have the key. You're listening to them, you're listening. Do you know why I am listening? Because they're talking. Oh, well, said. These friends, these films friends these journalists, they praise you for the things you never did and pan you for the rare evening of Godliness. These friends. These friends of ours whom we talk to on the phone.. They have praised you too much, John. Not to detract from your reviews you deserve praise, much praise. Not however for those things which they have praised you for. In your opinion. In my opinion. Yes that's true. Might we go in? Yes, you have the key. (Robert) 'What I wished to say, whatwished to say.' Uh, John, is this. 'You..' You must be very careful from who you take advice. Hmm. Yes. Never take advice from people who do not show a vested interest in your eventual success. Barring that, the beauty of the theater. I thought they were rather to the point. - You did? - Yes. Uh, your reviews? - Yes. - Oh! All false modesty aside. Yes. Oh, the young, the young, the young. Farmer in the Dell. Oh, I see. 'May I have my tail please?' You stupid twit. I beg your pardon. I think you heard me. - Robert. - What? Use your own towels from now on. They're at the laundry. Well, get them back. [jazz music] Uh.. Moses saw it on the hills of, uh.. And you dragged yourself.. The noted infertility of the historic throne of France was lifted, I say, yes, when a returning palmer came back from the holy land. Oh, God, I think it was a.. What was it? Uh.. Sugar and quinine, and he sent me out for.. What was it? Gum Arabic and.. What was it? Uh, t-thyme. Yeah, and w-we put 'em up in pills. You know, and roll 'em. Put 'em in a box, and shake it. To frost them with these cloves. Cloves that I had powdered. And it gave them a marvelous taste. A bitter after taste but.. And he would stop me, you know? Stop me from eating them. I rather liked them. But he would not give me money for sweets. Isn't that funny? I, I.. Back from the holy lands. Most of the people had sexual complaints...I think. Uh, the insecurities, you know.. But the thing of it was and for which I will always be grateful. He said address them. Look 'em straight in the eye. You talk out to 'em and you say I know, and we are here to help you. And I.. I looked...before me.. ...at this young boy and-and.. 200 people, 200 wanderers going from this place to that. Had been stopped by the sound of my voice. Oh, they had been coalesced into an audience by the sound of my voice. They just stood there around me rapt. Waiting for the next word. As they stood on the quay in Alexandria. As they stood in the desert, as they stood in Rome. In cities and civilizations, lost to memory. Roll up. You sent for me. I have come. And I hold in my hand.. Good old man. Good for me. What the hell, it's all show business. [jazz music] Now all the youth of England are on fire and silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies. Now thrive the armorers, and honor's thought reigns solely in the breast of every man. (Robert) 'Ah, sweet poison of the actor.' 'Rehearsing in an empty theatre upon an empty stage.' (Robert) But full of life, full of action. Full of resolve, full of...youth. Please continue. I'd like you to. I'm sorry does this upset you? Does it upset you when someone is watching? I'm sorry, I understand that. It is good. It is quite...good. I've been watching for awhile. I hope you don't mind, do you mind? - Well, I only just began. - Yeah, I know. And I have been watching and it seems so full. You're very good. Have I told you this lately? You're becoming a very fine young actor. The flaws of the youth are, are.. ...are the prerequisite of the young It is the prerequisite of the young to possess the flaws of the youth. It's fitting, yes. Don't mock me. John, you shouldn't mock me, it's too easy. It is not good for you. No, and that is a lesson we have to learn. That you should learn. And what is that? That it is a hurtful flaw to confuse sincerity with weakness, John. - I must tell you something. - 'And what is that?' Simply this. In the theater as in life.. Yeah, and the theater 'course is a part of life. You see, you see what I'm saying? That just as at the beach, or at the grocery store one cannot separate the time one spends. It's part of your life, do you see? In addition to the fact that what happens on that stage is life...of a sort. It's a part of our lives. That is one of the reasons I am so grateful, if I may presume. I recognize that it may seem presumptuous.. ...to see you. 'To the young of the theater.' 'And no, it's not unlike one's children.' Following in the footpaths, the footsteps of those who went before. Do you see what I'm saying? I would like to think you did. Do you? John.. Well, well.. Goodnight, John. - 'Goodnight.' - Goodnight. I'll see you. They sell the pasture now to buy the horse. Following the mirror of all Christian kings with winged heels, as English Mercuries. For now sits expectation in the air. And hides a sword.. Are you back there? Robert, are you out there? I see you. I see you out there. Robert? (Robert) 'I'm just leaving.' No, you weren't just leaving. You were looking at me. 'On the way out.' On my way out! Christ, you make me feel small. You make me feel small, John. I don't feel good. Are you crying? 'For Christ's sake, Robert, are you crying?' Yes. 'Well, stop crying.' Yes, I will. No, stop it now. Stop it, please. Better? Yes. - Are you alright? - Yes, I'm fine, thank you. I'm alright, I just suppose I'll.. You're gonna work some more? What? - Are you-- - Yes, yes. 'Well, then I suppose I'll..' I was leaving anyway. Goodnight. Goodnight, John. Are you alright now, Robert? Robert, are you alright now? 'Yes, fine, thank you.' 'I-I'm alright. I'm fine.' 'You're not angry with me, are you?' No. 'You're sure?' Yes. 'I'm glad you are. Thank you.' (John) 'Goodnight, Robert.' Now all the youth of England are on fire.. Robert? Robert? 'Are you still out there?' Are you still out there? [sighs] They sell the pasture now to buy the horse (both) Following the mirror of all Christian kings With winged heels, as English Mercuries. For now sits expectation in the air And hides a sword. (Robert) 'Gingerly, gingerly now.' 'Measure twice and cut once, eh.' You're allowed to laugh. Give me some suction there, will you, doctor? That's good. Christ, what I'd give for a cigarette. Uh, in just a few minutes I think I'll join you in one. - Nervous, Jimmy? - No. Yes. [laughing] In a few years you'll be doing these in your sleep. Suction, suction. Retractor. - No, the large retractor. - Sorry. That's alright, just give me another one. Thank you. What's that? What's that? No.. Uh, co-could you give me a reading on the, um, electro.. Please, would you? Would you please get me a reading on this man? What's that? What is what? What's that near his spleen? A curious growth near his spleen. What? A curious growth near his spleen. Is that one there? No, I think not. I think we cannot see a curious growth near his spleen for some time to come. Before the man goes into shock, would you please get me a reading on his vital...statements? Th-the functions.. Would you do that one thing for me? Hmm? Please? I fear I must disagree with you, doctor. Now, will you please give me a reading on his vital things? For the love of God! That's in the other part. No, it is not. He's in shock. He is in shock! I'm getting miffed with you. If you desire to work in this business again will you give a reading? Huh? If you want to work in this hospital.. Do I have to call a policeman, hmm? Have you no feelings? The man is in deepest shock! Where are you going? You quitter! Ladies and gentlemen.. ...what we have seen here today is.. I will not say a perfect, but a very good example of successful surgical technique. Performed under modern optimum conditions 'with a minimum of fuss.' A minimum of mess, and bother and I hope that you have.. That you.. [tires screeching] [dramatic music] [music continues] My God, I've cut myself. [laughing] What have you done? I'm bleeding. Hey.. You know what a silly accident, can you believe this? Come on. How good of you to come. We're taking you to the hospital. No. I'm-I'm alright now, I see that. Yes, really. - Come on. - No, no. All kidding aside, no, I am quite alright. My razor slipped. I'm fine now. I had that moment though. Yes, really. 'But I-I'm.. John?' 'I'm fine.' I'm fine. Did you know, John.. Did you know in olden days they used to say "clean shaven like an actor?" 'Did you know that?' Are you alright? Yes. Oh, yeah, I'm fine. I lost a little blood is all. It's nothing to it, just a mishap. 'Clean shaven.' Robert, what's wrong with you? No, nothing is wrong with me. My hand slipped. I'm tired. That's all, I'm just tired. I need to rest. We all need rest. Too much. Just too much. You understand? - I'm calling you a doctor. - Oh, no. No, you're not. No! Please! Please! 'It's good of you to come.' I see I have disturbed you. It was for nothing at all, you can go home now. 'I'm fine.' 'I was only tired and that's all.' See, we think we see things clearly when we haven't slept. But we do not, and I've cut myself. Dirtied up the basin.. But it's all fine now. I think I need to get some sleep. I disturbed you, I have no excuse. I'm sorry, I was only tired. I'm going to sit here a while, and then I'll get to bed. 'I'm alright!' I'll be alright tomorrow, I'll be my old self. I'm alright now. Really. Thank you. I'll sit here a moment and then I'll go to bed. Thank you. [dramatic music] [sighs] [music continues] I loved the staircase scene tonight. - 'You did?' - Just like a poem. I thought the execution scene worked beautifully. Oh, you didn't. - Yes, I did. - Oh, thank you. It's getting cold, huh? - Yes. - Getting cold, huh? Cold in our bones. Winter on the way, the smell of snow in the air. You know, the old man always wanted me to be an actor? - Did he? - Always wanted me to be. Roll up and be a prize. - Well.. - Rain? - I think it might. - Oh. - Got a fag? - Yes. Always wanted me to be. Thank you. - Got a light? - Going out? Yes. No, I'm going with some people. Do you have a match? You're going out tonight? I suppose. Not eating well these days. - 'No, huh?' - No. - 'Why?' - Not hungry. Here, I got it. - Do you mind? - No. Thank you. - A life spent in the theater. - Hmm. - Backstage.. - Yes. Buzz, the house, drafty holes. - Penciled scripts. - Yes. Oh, the stories, the stories you hear. I know. It all goes so fast. It goes quickly. You think that I might borrow 20, until tomorrow? - You short of cash? - Yes. Oh, oh, here. You sure you won't need it? No, of course not. No. If I don't know how it is, who does? - Here. - Thank you. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - You have a nice night. - I will. Goodnight. [whispering] Ephemeris, ephemeris. Oh, for an actor's life. You have been so kind. Thank you. You have really.. ...been so kind. And I speak, I'm sure not for myself alone but.. ...on behalf of all of us, all of us here when I say that these moments.. ...these moments make it all.. Just make it all worthwhile. You know.. [door opens] They're locking up. They'd like us all to leave. - I was just leaving. - 'Yes, I know.' - I'll tell them. - 'Would you?' - Yes. - 'Thank you.' Goodnight. Goodnight. The lights dim. Each to his own home. Goodnight. Goodnight. Goodnight. [instrumental music] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues]
