God.. I'm unable to live with this sadness. There's nothing left for me to stay alive for! Life is full of problems and pain. I want peace. Everlasting peace. I think I can attain it.. ...only if I stop living. All my life you've worked against me. For once, pick my side. Without letting me feel the fear of death, take my life at once. While I was studying, for no reason at all,.. ...I felt like looking up. And it felt like someone came and whispered asking me to look up! I kept wondering why I felt that way and decided to look up He looked like the most beautiful thing in the universe! My heart began to pound like a drum! I casually dived into the pool of love, it was only later.. ...I realised that I can't swim! By the time I could let go of my shyness and push myself to.. ...ask someone about him, a lot of days had passed. What I finally found out was.. His name was Rohit. So, he's two years senior to me. His parents are no more. His sister and brother-in-law live in Singapore. He's a class topper. Everyone had the same thing to say about him. That he is a good guy and is innocent. And he was good at Dot Drawing. It is a technique of drawing using only dots and no lines. Despite his hesitance, his friends would force him and.. ...put his drawings up on the notice board. Wow! That's a good looking piece of art, right? And the artist is no less good looking! - I have no idea about that. Haven't you seen him? - I can't wait to see him now! Do that. - Is he that good looking? He's pretty handsome. He already has a big female fan following. And now with this drawing, more girls are sure to join the club. If that's the case, then I'm the new one on the list. Heard you put Aishwarya Rai on the notice board without telling me? I refused to do so, but Praveen was adamant. The drawing's pretty average. See for yourself. Where did Aishwarya Rai go? She was right here! - Then where did she go? Rohit, I'm sorry! I think along with love, jealousy comes for free. Enough of staring and stealing, go talk to him tomorrow! Is that necessary? Come on! Practice how you're going to talk to him! Excuse me? Umm.. Hi. My name's Dia.. Dia Swaroop. The name's Bond.. James Bond! Just tell him that it's Dia Swaroop! Excuse me? Hi! My name is Dia Swaroop. Third year, Bio-tech student. You draw really well! *MUFFLED REHEARSAL* Conductor: Tickets? Anyone? Ticket? You draw really well! - Heh?! *CONTINUES REHEARSING* He's all alone. This is it. Go! Talk to him! Be confident! Make sure your legs don’t tremble. Wipe the sweat off your face. Go! Come one! Greet him! It's okay! There's still a lot of time left before he finishes college! Better luck next time. Oh God! Hey Rohit! I wonder if I'm making a mistake by approaching.. ...him without any topic to talk about. Yep! That’s true. If I come up with a strong reason, I can easily approach and talk to him. But what could it be? If only I could ask him to clarify some academic doubts. But we aren't even in the same course! What excuse do I have? Excuse?! Umm.. Excuse me? Yes! I am. I think this.. ...belongs to you. This is mine! Where did you find it? Erm.. I found it near the basketball court. I was putting it up for everyone to see, and someone was taking it away! Thank you! By the way, what's your name? What happened? It's nothing! My name is.. Excuse me? Yes? Yes. - My name's Dia Swaroop.. I'm a third year Bio-Tech student. I think this belongs to your classmate. Yeah. This is Rohit's. I found it by the basketball court. I wanted to find him but he's nowhere in college. Well, he quit college and left! Did he quit college? He got a job in Korea since he had finished his engineering course. So he discontinued the course and quit college. If you want to give it personally, you'll have to go to Korea. Thank you. - It's okay! Did he not look like Rohit? Was it really him or am I imagining this? Oh God! It really is him! Thanks! - It's okay. What is he doing here in Mumbai?! That too in my apartment?! But, why are you hiding now? He has no clue about you. Act normal! What do I do now? Go talk to him. Practice your lines before you do! *MUFFLED REHEARSAL* Oh! This guy will get down in the next floor. And then, it's just us in the lift! Just the thought of it is giving me the jeebs in my tummy! There he goes! I'm suffocating! Looks like I'm never talking to him in this lifetime! You are.. Dia.. Dia Swaroop, right? Hi! My name's Rohit. But due to some reasons, I couldn't complete the course. I've seen you before. Where was that? If you can recall, you'd once burst the test tube in.. ...the Chemistry lab sending a few classmates into shock. 'You were the reason behind the explosion' I was talking to your professor and he had told me your name. Oh! Is it? And how come you're here? - I'm here on work. I moved in this afternoon. I'm staying in 701. What? 701?! Yes! Why do you ask? I stay right opposite to you. In 702! Is it? What a coincidence! I'll leave now. Let's meet again. Bye! - Bye. Dia? - Huh? I studied in that college for eight months. In those eight months, did you even know who I was? Or did you ever see me in college? Uncle, he's Rohit. He studied in my college in Bengaluru. Oh. Is it? Hi Rohit! - Hi Sir! I'm Madhav Rao. I'm their family friend. I live in Flat no.203. If you need anything, feel free to ask. Sure, sir. He's my father. Hello, Sir. - Hello. Okay Dia. We're heading out for some work. You asked if I'd seen you in college, right? If only I'd stared into my books as much as I stared.. ...at you, I would've topped the class. If we'd stayed any longer, we could have finished our morning jog. Do you always jog? Yeah! I made it a habit when I was in Korea. And you? Me? And jogging? I generally wake up only by 9 A.M. - Why so late? Oh! Do you sleep late? No. I do sleep pretty early. I think I have an issue. I can't sleep continuously at one stretch. Even minute sounds tend to disturb me. I have a disturbed sleep pattern. There's a belief in Korea. If you're not able to sleep, it's because you're awake in someone else's dreams. Here's what you can do if you can't sleep. Before you sleep, close your eyes for a minute and imagine.. ...who you would want to spend your entire life with. Tell them a message and try sleeping. You'll get a good night's sleep. And where does this belief come from? From the belief that we're secure in life. I wish to spend all my life with you. I love you. Jogging! Dear Dia.. 19th March 2016. On that day, a precious moment took place in my life. My heart found its other half. Except you, everyone else became strangers to me. An invisible wall got created between me and them. You might just be another person to the world But to me you became my world. Please forgive me. Because I've no words to express how much I love you. But one thing's for sure. Every time I take a breath, I think of you! Love you, Rohit. Who was she? My office colleague. She proposed me. And what did you tell her? I told her, "That there's a girl who has made me.. ...forget all the others girls in the world." That I came to Mumbai only for her. I was the one who was stealing your drawings in college. And I was putting them up only to impress you. Do you know now? Whose dream you were always up in? We wasted three years, right? But there are thirty more to go. Okay! I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. Sorry. It was a call from office. I got out faking a head ache, but they're giving me one for real. I love you! It's 6 P.M. already and the film's yet to start. Is there some issue? I love you! Did you say something? - Didn't you hear me? Nope. - What's wrong with you today? On any other day, you would have told it a hundred odd times by now. Chuck saying it once, you're pretending to not.. ...have heard me when I'm saying it out loud. What's wrong? Are you angry with me? I've no reasons to be angry with you. The thing is.. Today I read in the newspaper that.. ...'One touch is equal to thousand words'. One touch is equal to thousand words! What are you saying? Let me explain.. We'll spend the rest of our lives with each other, right? Yeah. So, if any one of us wishes to say 'I love you' to each other.. We need to hold each other's hand and.. I.. Love.. You..! Press each other's hand thrice. Doing this once is the same as saying it out loud a thousand times. One touch is equal to thousand words. I can sense the difference. But this seems incomplete, right? How does one reply to this? Very smart. It's very simple. Me.. Too.. Press it twice and you're done. Seems childish, but it's effective. I.. Love.. You..! Me.. Too! Next month, I've asked my sister and brother-in-law to come to Mumbai. To Mumbai? For what? To discuss about our marriage with your father.. Oh.. For that.. What happened? What happened?! I doubt if my father will agree to our marriage. Oh! You think so? Erm.. What do we do now? Okay. We can do this.. Dude, let's go! Stop you idiot! He got away! Dear Lord! Call the ambulance! Hurry up! Dia? How are you dear? Rohit? - Umm.. Rohit's doing fine. Nothing to worry. He's fine. I want to see him. That's not possible now. He's in the ICU. No one's being allowed inside. I shall take you there later. I want to see him now. Okay. Lie down. The thing is.. Dia.. Rohit had passed away before we could get him to the hospital. He's dead. I'm sorry. Calm down dear. Please! I.. Love.. You. Dia is extremely upset. UNCLE: Let's send her over to your sister's house in Bengaluru. A change of place could help. Since Smitha's also there, she'll be more comfortable. Hello? - Hello Dia. What are you up to? I'm sitting in the park. Oh. Is it? Also.. Dia..? There is a doctor's appointment this evening, right? Can you go by yourself to the hospital? I'm out with my friends. I might get a little late. I'm sorry. Please don't mind? Hello? - Hello! Is this Dia Soup on the other side? It isn't Soup.. It's Swaroop. I know. I was just kidding. I was hoping to make you laugh, since you're upset. Are you wondering, how I got to know? Don't worry. I do have some good news to make you happy. Want me to tell you? This noon, when you were walking alone in the park road. Hello? I couldn't hear you. Repeat what you just said. Hello? The bike needs to be given for service, is it? Fine. How about you come to my room? From my room, let's go to the service station. Hand over the bike and then head to the stadium. Is that fine? You! Stop! Stop right there. I got the bag and looked for you.. But you were nowhere to be seen. Looks like you had already left to the police station. So, now.. Your vanity bag is with me. Now tell me. When and where will you meet me? Tell me where, and I'll come and handover the bag in person. Where do we meet? Would a Coffee Day do? I don't need the bag. Keep it with yourself. Please don't call me again. Huh? You don't want the bag is it? It has your debit and credit cards, with some cash.. Hello? To hell with this woman! If she didn't want the bag, I could've given it to the thief himself. Poor guy could have used some money. Leave that. How did you find her phone number? The bag had a CICI bank debit card. Our Raju works in their customer care, right? Raju who? You mean Buttermilk Raju? - Yep! Him! I gave him the card number. He gave me the phone number. She scolded me and disconnected the call. Have you ever heard of this before? A girl refusing to take her vanity bag? I've never come across this before. This is why they say, "Life is full of surprises and miracles" Do estimate the costs and let me know. I forgot to tell you this. - What? Tonight, Mother India will be coming down from Karwar. Oh, is it? - Yes. She's taking the night bus. She's coming down for a medical conference. That’s in two weeks.. Sir.. It will cost you Rs.4,500/- Rs 4,500?! - Yes, sir. The chain sprocket needs to be completely replaced. Oil needs to be replaced. This alone will cost you Rs.2,000/- - Dude, I'll be back. Chandru? Please attend Consultation No.1. Sudha? You're next. Lakshmi: If only Karwar had a hospital like this.. Hello Ma'am. - Can I meet Dr.Vidya? Dr.Lakshmi? Welcome ma'am. Ma'am has strictly instructed me to bring you to her. What's with that reaction? Lakki! I'm proud to call you as my mother. Very proud! And why's that? Because people in your profession have a high opinion of you! Adi, I'll need an hour to get done with work. It's an important case. Take your time, Lakki. I'll be at a library close by. Finish your work and call me, I'll come right away. Dia Swaroop? Dia Swaroop..? You're here to meet the Orthopaedic, right? She's checking other patients. Please wait for five minutes. Can I get a picture of your feet? So that I can set it as my mobile wallpaper? Dia Soup? When I'd called you, were you out on some important work? You switched off your phone after telling me.. ...to keep the bag and that you don't want it. Or did you think that I was with the thief and.. ...that I called you over to rob everything off you? I'm sorry. I was kidding again, since you were upset. Okay. You finish your consultation and wait here. I'll get your bag as soon as possible. Lakki, I didn't know that one had to struggle so much to do a good deed! You can only take the horse to the water. But you can't make it drink, right? Let it go. And where are we going now? I told you that bike is out on service, right? That should be done by now. Let's collect the bike and head to a mall to enjoy the air conditioning. Okay. And then.. Lakki, there's a surprise waiting for you. A surprise? What is it? The surprise is that.. I'd told you about a new bike I saw at the service store, right? The one you showed me on the internet? Yep. The same bike. I've decided to buy that bike. The same bike? - Yep. Weren't you telling me that it was heavy? It's not like I’ll be carrying the bike around, I'll be riding it. But then.. weren't you telling me that it was quite expensive? It does cost Rs.2.25 lakhs.. But you don't worry. My PF money from the last company.. ...is available. I'm also thinking of taking a loan. I don't think you should do it. It isn't worth to invest so much on a bike. Instead buy a less expensive one? Umm.. I can. But I felt like buying a new one only after seeing that. I don't know. I'm not really okay with you buying it. I'll leave it to you. Yes.. You can begin with the antibiotic course. With the.. Cephalexin. Also, how many were there for the Polio drive? Adi? Did you feel bad? Can't lie that I didn't. I did feel bad.. A little. But I'll ask you again.. Do you really not want me to buy that bike? Don't buy it. It doesn't feel right. You go on with your calls, I'll go get the serviced bike. Please wait for five minutes. The bill needs to be generated. Your bike will be brought outside. Thank you. Ambika! Please take this invoice. Excuse me, sir? Congratulations, sir. From this moment, this bike is yours. Right after the day you saw the bike,.. ...your mother came down and booked it for you. Hello? I don't like it when you buy things. But I love buying things for you. You ape! Do you know how innocent you look when you're sleeping? Everybody looks innocent when they're sleeping. Only when one’s awake will you see a man's true colour. Fine. I've written a letter for you. Can I read it out for you? A letter? - Yeah. Read it out. Don't laugh, okay? To, Dear Mom.. Sometimes I wonder if my body.. What happened? You just called me mom.. Tell me why I call you Lakki..? Because my name's Lakshmi! In short, you call me Lakki. Nope. Isn't that the reason? Till date, I thought that is why you were calling me Lakki. Then why? The answer to that is in the end of the letter. So be patient. To, Dear Mom.. Sometimes I wonder if my body has two hearts. Would it be possible to love you so much with just one heart? I love the fact that I love you! You've simplified my life so much.. That none of the problems seem problematic at all. They all seem trivial.. - Adi? Why's the house owner here? Good Morning Adi! - Morning, Uncle. Looks like you've bought a new bike. Congratulations! Could you park your bike outside? I need to take my car out. Oh! Sorry uncle. Give me a minute. Let me get the keys. Looks like the movie's underway.. - What are the seat numbers? Row number I-10 and 11 If I don't watch a movie from the beginning, it doesn't feel right at all. Sir? - Huh? How long since the movie started? - It should end anytime now. Dude! I'll get something to eat. Are you feeling better now? You were at the hospital, right? So now tell me. What injustice have I done to you? Huh? I ran back to the hospital thinking I'll earn ten.. ...kilograms of good deeds by returning your bag. You were nowhere to be seen. Do you know how bad I felt? I'm sorry. Fine. What's done is done already. Here's what you're going to do. My room's at a walkable distance from here. Once the movie ends, you'll come along with me and collect your bag. Okay? Have you come alone? I've come with my cousin, she's gone to the washroom. Will you have something to eat or drink? I don't want anything. Come on! You'll have to take something for having met again.. No need. If I leave you alone for a while, you'll disappear again No need to eat anything. Not bad. Your cousin Smitha is pretty friendly. See how weird life is.. I had no plans of coming for this movie. At the end moment, my friend forced me to come along. And I find you next to me. This is why it's said that life's full of surprises and miracles.. What do you say? Life isn't what you just said.. This is life! Full of problems and pain. Here. So, according to you, everyone in this world has one or the other pain or problem. Looks like you don't know Bengaluru well. Which is why you're saying this. Right here there's an area. People who live there.. Till date haven't faced any problems and are living happily. Do you believe me? That's impossible! There's no one without problems. - Then come with me.. I'll take you to that area right away. See for yourself, how happily people are living there. Let's go. What are you thinking? Aren't you curious? If you don't come along, I won't return your bag. Feel free to complain with the cops! Please come! I ran like a mad dog behind the thief just for your bag! Did you know that I have cuts on my legs? Please come along. Come on. That area's really nice. You'll enjoy a lot! Ms. Dia.. As far as I know. The only ones who're living.. ...without any problems or pain in his world.. Are those who reside here. So.. Take a good look at them! See, how peacefully everyone's sleeping. Actually you're right.. People on this earth have one or the other problem. It is just like... Like a moustache and beard.. No matter how hard you try, it'll keep growing. But when it does arrive, how we react to it.. Is what will decide if we're happy or sad. It's all about our attitude towards the problem. What's ironic is that.. It is our problems that make our lives more interesting. Without which there wouldn't be any difference.. ...between those who are sleeping here and us. But how long can one keep eating only Mysuru Pak? To say it in simple words.. Life isn't about living without problems. It's about how we solve our problems and live on. But Dia.. You went ahead to end your life because you lost your loved one, right? You had the courage to kill yourself. Couldn't you show the same courage to live? Thank God that nothing went wrong.. At a time like this, I have one thing to say.. We'll attain peace for real, only when we accept our reality. Accept the reality. Let him go. I know it's easier said than done.. But you have to. You have two options now. One. Is to keep thinking of Rohit and live in sorrow. Two. To forget him and start a new life. Choose the one that seems right to you. Adi? Hello? I'm outside your house. Come out. Hello Adi? - We're going out. Come on! Adi, please tell me where you're taking me. Phew! How long will you ask the same question like a broken record? Told you right? That we're heading somewhere! But where are we going? - To some place. You trust me right? A bit too much. Then stop asking me questions and come quietly. Adi, please don't take me to the graveyard at this hour. I'll get very scared! You never know! 'BEST WISHES FROM!' Everyone get ready! 1.. 2.. 3.. Start! All Hail Bombay Queen, Dia Swaroop! - Hurray! All Hail Birthday Queen, Dia Swaroop! - Hurray! All Hail Beauty Queen, Dia Swaroop! Beauty Queen doesn't suit her, right? *IN UNISON* - Yeah! All Hail the Normal Queen, Dia Swaroop! - Hurray! I wish we had three birthdays in a year, we could have enjoyed.. You look like you've come straight out of the graveyeard. Even you look the same. Really? I've turned into a male ghost. They stuffed the cake right into my nose and ears! Thank you Adi! Thank you so much. Thanks to you, I feel good about myself. I feel like I am a special person too. I love myself! - Woah! Woman.. Now you're on the right track. And... Don't show yourself to anyone else. One look at that pretty face of yours.. And they'll go mad thinking they saw a ghost inside the house! That won't happen. There's no one at home. Everyone's gone to Tumakuru. What? No one's home is it? No one except me. Do you have any common sense at all? My face is stinking of eggs! You're the birthday girl! Instead of calling me inside and making me a cup of coffee! You're making me stand out here and are thanking me.. Drat! I'm sorry Adi. It didn't occur to me at all. Please come inside. Fine! I'll come in. It's all my fate. You were right Adi. I dont' have any common sense. I'm sorry. It's okay. Common sense is not so common. Here you go. Drink and let me know how it is. That I will! For sure. If it's not good, I'll pour it over your head! How is it? Where has this talent of yours been hiding? This is too good. When did you master this craft? Your husband is going to be very lucky to.. ...drink and eat all these delicious food. I've decided not to marry. Where will the point of a husband come from? You're insulting me. Insult? How? - What else..? When a guy like me is right in front of you? How did you decide that you won't marry? Adi, please! Don't joke about this. You might have a lot of friends like me. But you're my only best friend. Let's not bring love in between our friendship. I've suffered enough because of love. If you bring it up again.. - I'm sorry. It was at the tip of my tongue and I said it out loud. Don't worry. When the last birthday of your life is due. Your 99th birthday.. Let's celebrate that birthday together in a big way. As best friends. Happy now? These conditions apply to you too. You should not bring up these topics either. No. I won't. It's good that the bike ran out of fuel. With every push of this bike, my pants are getting ripped off! And this seems like fun to you, huh? You're a sadist. Nah. Not for that. Our departing moment got delayed by fifteen minutes, right? That's why. You're talking as if we'll never meet again in our lifetime.. We may meet again someday.. And we will meet for sure. But we won't be able to meet from tomorrow. I'm going back to Mumbai for good, Adi. You’re going back? - Yeah. My aunt's mother is unwell. She's going to her native to take care of her. How can I stay at her house without her around? Is that why Smitha called you in the evening? Then why didn't you tell me back then? If I had told you, we would've spoken only about me leaving. You should have told me. And now it seems so sudden.. When are you leaving? I'm taking the 7.30 A.M. bus. Okay. Give me a second. Shall we begin the farewell program? Go back and start a new life. Remember this. Life goes by in seconds. Make sure you do only those things that you like. That doesn't mean you start smoking because you like cigarettes. Only the good things. And if you encounter any problems, doubts or.. ...confusions, you already have the customer care number. Customer care number? - My mobile number. Of course. Who else will I call? Just a second. Here. A small gift from me. A Gift? Okay. Wait.. We saw this at the mall.. Bought this for you when you went to get your bike. Oh! I'm sorry. I have nothing to give you. Will you take this bike with you? That's fine. I already have a gift from you. You already have a gift from me? What is it? - It's you. You're my biggest gift. Would've been nice if you stayed back for another day. You're saying the exact thing that's on my mind. But I have to go. Adi? Why are you calling at this hour Adi? - Lakki! Don't panic! Calm down. I'm doing good, and I’m awesome. I felt like talking to you. So only I called. For a moment I got so worried. So? Were you asleep? Nah! I was playing cricket with Nanjamma! Quit wasting time and tell me why you're upset. Oh! Looks like you got a whiff of my mood. Yep. The stink reached me. Tell me. It's nothing. Dia's going back to Mumbai. So.. Why do I smell something more? - Nothing of that sorts Lakki. Over time, we've gotten closer to each other. And now, out of the blue she told me that she's leaving. So... Well.. She had to go someday, right? She had to.. I feel it would've been nice if she'd stayed back for another day. What does Dia have to say about it? Let's say that she felt the same too. Fine. Here's what you can do. Let Dia not go to Mumbai directly. You both head to Mangaluru. Konkan Express goes to Mumbai from Mangaluru at 11.45 P.M. You both can board it. You get down at Karwar. She can continue to Mumbai. You both can spend a day together. What an idea Lakki! You should've become a criminal lawyer instead of a doctor. I've to tell Dia about this right away. I'll see you in Karwar. Bye. Hello Adi? - What is it? How will you be coming to Mangaluru from Bengaluru? How else? We'll take the bus. You doofus! You think I bought you that bike worth Rs 2 lakhs so that you.. ...can use it like a public bus between your room and tuition? The weather's good. The scenery on the way is beautiful. Instead of enjoying the nature and riding.. ...down on a bike, you speak of taking the bus. What are you doing here? I'd gone to take a leak. It was suffocating inside. So I'm out here breathing some fresh air. We spent a day like it was a minute. Ours must have been the shortest bike trip in the pages of history. When you’re happy, that is how it is. Time goes by very quickly. I forgot to tell you this. The train reaches the Karwar station at 7:30 in the morning. The moment we arrive, I'll leave without even taking a look at your face. You also do the same. Don't get down from your seat. Stay put! But why? - Because this whole process of.. ..our loved ones departing while we stand by the door or window.. ...with a long face., looking at the train while it disappears.. ...tends to bring a bit of pain. We're anyways moving away. Why make it worse? Let's just bid goodbye and leave. Come. Let's go. Let's do it your way. You get off the train on your own and I'll stay in my seat. So? How long do you plan to stay in Karwar? My slipper slipped away! Let them find the pair together. What good will one slipper do? The girl in the upper berth's pretty, right? Love in a train coach, huh? - Nah! Nothing of those sorts. Just appreciating the finer things in life. Say you fall in love with someone in the future. What will you do? I'll go ahead and propose her. Don't rush! Introduce her to me. Within fifteen minutes, I'll find out if she loves you or not. Check out Ms. Bond! Madam claims to find out if someone's in love in fifteen minutes. Well you know that I've a doctorate in Love. Oh ya. You're right. As you say madam. If ever I fall in love with someone.. Aye! Go to bed. You both have been snuffling like bandicoots since then! Go to bed! Drat! As if my wife annoying me at home wasn't enough. Excuse me? Wake up! Has the station arrived? The station won't arrive anywhere, we've arrived at the station! The train reached five minutes ago. Get going. Thank your Boss! Dia? "You get off the train on your own and I'll stay in my seat." Hello? - Hello Madam! I think you got off at the wrong station. Your station is pretty far away. - What do I do, sir? I wish to spend as much time as I possibly can.. ...with my best friend before my station arrives. But he clearly has no common sense to invite his friend who's come to his town. Slap me once! Huh? - Slap me once. I've made a mistake. I should have invited you home, but I didn't.. ...and just like you told, I have no common sense. Slap me! That's okay. A guy once told me that 'Common sense is not so common'. The same idiot is now telling you that, 'Guilty must be.. ...punished'. That the wrong ones have to be punished. Slap me now! It's okay. Leave it now. - It's okay. Slap me. You have the right to slap. I deserve to be slapped. I won't feel bad about it. Be bold and.. I'm.. Sorry! Now the debts have been cleared! Please come home? Please?! On you next visit, don't bring the child. Take this. Who's next? Hello Doctor! I've AIDS! How come you're alone? Where's Dia? She seemed a bit tired. I asked her to rest and came by myself. It must be the stress from the travel. Wait! There are no other patients outside, right? My mother has taught me basic etiquette. What are you doing? I'm checking for sounds in my tummy. Is that so? I was wondering if you were checking for those two hearts in your body. What are you saying Lakki? Who will have two hearts in their body? There are two kidneys. And the heart, just.. The Letter! How come I who wrote it has forgotten, but.. ...you remember it just by listening to it? How could I forget it? You've written such an adorable letter. You've praised me to the skies. What's this Lakki? You're smitten just by listening to one third of it? If you read it all, that is it.. Come lie down! Tell me the truth. Do you mean it from your heart? Or is it all for the sake of...? Lakki, you're hurting me. I've written from my heart. Now take those words back! I'm sorry! I take my words back! Now sleep! Where did I stop? If I've helped someone today, their gratitude shouldn't be towards me.. But towards you. Because, whatever I am today, you are the reason for it. I always knew that you were my mother. But when did you become my best friend? Whatever it is that I want to hear from you.. How do you say those exact words? Hello? - Hello? Brother Adi? Her body temperature is flaming hot! Bring mom and come home soon! Dia's supposedly unwell. How long until aunty returns home? I don't know. She called me to tell that there's an emergency case. She spends more time in the hospital than at home. Drink some more. - I'm done. Okay. I'll keep it here. Have it when you feel like it. I'm troubling all of you for no reason. Will you have some more water? I just drank some. - How about dinner? Dinner? - Do you need a sleeping tablet? Sleeping tablet?! Then what will you take to shut up and sleep? So much for troubles! I hate all these formalities. I won't talk to you. I'm done with you! Sorry. If you speak of troubling me again.. I’ll break your teeth! Okay. Get some peaceful sleep. I'll be right outside in the living room. If you need anything.. Whistle out and I'll come running to you. I just checked if you could hear me. I pretty much can. Apparently my horoscope and theVaastu of this house doesn't match. If one eye's sleeping, the other eye's up all night. My sleep pattern's a bit disrupted. Oh is it? Here's what you can do. I wish to spend all my life with you. I love you! How do I tell her Lakki? Having casually told each other that we won't talk about love,.. How can I tell her that I really love her now? She seems to be at peace with her past. She even believes that I'm the reason for it. Would it be right if I spoil it all? Since when did you start being so negative? Why do you assume that she won't accept you? Try talking to her once. Let's see what happens. It's not as easy as you're thinking it to be. If she accepts, then it's fine. If she rejects.. It'll turn ugly. I won't be able to face her. Adi? Lakki, Dia's here. I'll call you later. Adi? How are you now? - You mean the fever? The fever subsided last night itself. Also Adi.. Dad had called. He said he's buying a property. Apparently he wants my signature for a document.. ...and asked me to leave for Mumbai right away. Do you really have to go? - Yeah. It's 6:45 now. There's a train to Mumbai at 8:30. You can take that. Okay. I'll get ready then. I wish to spend all my life with you. I love you. Bro? Hey Adi! When did you come? It's been twenty eight years. Are you doing well? - I'm good. This is Dia. My friend. Had to go the railway station. - Sure. Get in. Keep this safely with you. Take your tablet after lunch without fail. I told you that my fever subsided, right? - Take it anyways. Since you're traveling, the fever might relapse. If I put you through any trouble, I'm sorry. Do you wish to go to Mumbai with broken teeth? It’s time to finally bid goodbye once and for all. All good things must come to an end. Why are you thanking me? It's free! The next time we meet, I think it'll be in Mumbai. Or we can meet in Bengaluru too. Or somewhere in between? In this very town? During your marriage? - I've decided that I'll never marry. You're insulting me now. You clearly have no doctorate in love! Leave! You're insulting me now. - You're insulting me now! You clearly have no doctorate in love! - I've a doctorate in Love. Insult? How? - What else? When a guy like me is right in front of you? How did you decide that you won't marry? Adi, please! Don't joke about this You're insulting me now! Madam claims to find out if someone's in love in fifteen minutes. I can! Well, you know that I've a doctorate in Love. You clearly have no doctorate in love! *MUFFLED FLASHES FROM THE PAST* Finally! I feel so elated.. As elated as a man with diarrhoea would feel when he finds a bathroom in time. I'm not able to breathe! Phew! This was not my fault. I didn't propose to you. Neither is it my fault. Nor did I propose to you. It's not the fault of either of us. All the blame is on love. Can we hug for a little longer? There's a lot of time before you get down. It's free! LAKKI! MY DEAR LAKKI! Hi Dia! In Dia's case, there's nothing to worry. There might be some minor injuries and fractures. She might gain consciousness in two hours and then she'll be fine. But in Rohit's case.. Doctor, what's wrong with Rohit? When the accident occurred.. This portion of the brain was severely injured leading.. ...to internal bleeding which in turn has resulted in a blood clot. Right now! He's in a vegetative state. It can also be considered that he is brain dead! In this state, the patient has no consciousness. Oxygen and energy will have to be provided.. ...externally to keep his life going. Doctor? He'll get cured and return to normalcy, right? Let me be frank with you. In cases like his we can never assure when he'll return to normalcy. It might take three months or six months.. Or he might spend the rest of his life on the bed. I'm sorry about that. They're taking Rohit to Singapore for better treatment. Damn it! What are you thinking? What will you tell Dia once she regains her senses and asks for Rohit? What else? We'll tell her that Rohit was taken to Singapore for better treatment. Let's not do that. Dia should never learn about this. What are you saying? Let's tell her that Rohit died in the accident. Yes. I've given it a lot of thought. We both know how madly Dia loves Rohit. If she learns the truth.. She'll spend all her life waiting and hoping for Rohit to return. And there's no guarantee to know whether Rohit will recover for sure. What if he never recovers? Lying to her might hurt her for a few days.. As time goes by, she'll forget Rohit. Let us convince her later and get her married to a good guy. By the grace of God, if Rohit recovers, let's get him married to Dia. Seems like you're very lucky. So only God has blessed you with what you wanted. And now.. Look how Rohit has come back with a new lease of life. Dia, to make sure that your future was safe and good. Your dad took that call. If at all you think he's wrong.. Forgive him. Go take a short walk. By the time you return, we'll decide on the wedding. Go on. How are you Dia? How did you manage thinking I was dead? Did you try to forget me? Or have you already forgotten me? If your answer is yes.. Everything you thought all these days will come true. But I know that you would never forgot me. Hello Drama Queen! Your phone was switched off all this while! Do you know how many times I tried calling you? Try switching off your phone again. I'll come down to Mumbai, murder you and get jailed for it. Go ahead and do it. I'll be thankful to you! Are you crying? What happened? Did your father scold you? He didn't. Then what happened? Tell me what happened. I'm can't take the silence. Adi. The thing is.. Rohit.. Life is indeed full of surprises and miracles. So what have you decided to do? I'm sorry! It was I who told you to call the customer care in case of any inconvenience, right? Give me five minutes. I will call you back. Hello? - No Dia! I can't even imagine a life without you. I lost my mind just because your phone was switched off. And to let you go forever..? No. Here's what I'll do. I'll pack my stuff and head to Mumbai right now. I'll come over and tell Rohit about us.. And bring you back with me. Let's go to Karwar and get married. Okay? Be ready for everything. I really wish I could tell you all of this and do as I said. But if I do this very thing.. 'My son turned so selfish. I didn't bring him up well.' These will be the words of my mother, who will regret it all her life. That will hurt me more than the pain of losing you. I don't want that. Now listen to me carefully. Don't worry about me at all. Don't even think of feeling guilty that you cheated Adi. You get married to Rohit happily! Just thinking of him makes me feel for him. I shouldn't do injustice to him. So.. I hope you get married to Rohit and lead a happy life. Also, I need a help from you. Will you please remove this SIM card from your mobile? Don't ever use it again! Does this mean that this is the last time we're talking? It's not as if our conversation will bring world peace. Please remove the SIM. I wish you all the best. Have a great life. I can still hear you breathe. Ms. Dia Soup. Adi? Adi! How are you Lakki? It's been so long since all of this happened,.. ...yet you never thought of telling me, right? Lakki, isn't it better to let dust get only one eye instead of two? Why should you also suffer over here, while I struggle back home? Why suffer together as if it's a clearance sale? I thought I could forget her easily. But.. - But you're not able to. Let it go. Now that you're here. Things will get better. I'm very proud to call you as my son. Proud! Why though? Because you told Dia to forget you and marry Rohit. That's why. I blurted it out to her at that moment. Do you know how I felt after saying it? It felt as if thousand men stabbed me all over. Seems love is the root cause of both excessive happiness.. ...and extreme pain for a human. What can I say? You know everything. Come home when you feel like it. I'll be waiting. Hello brother? This is Smitha here. Dia's cousin. Remember? I do. Yeah. So? Hope you're doing well. How well do you think a Piles patient can be doing? Dia was right. You are funny. The reason I called you now is.. ...to ask you to join us. We're heading to Mumbai today.. ...evening. The bus is also pretty empty. Let's have a nice chat on our way. To Mumbai? For what? What sort of question is that? The day after's Dia's wedding. Remember? Dia's getting married? Yeah. Actually the wedding's day after. Tomorrow night is the reception ceremony. But Dia told me that she's already told you about it. Looks like you forgot. No. I was just kidding. I'm in Karwar right now. Can you text me the venue details of the wedding? Sure. I will. Be there at any cost. Because they both are returning to Singapore.. ...right on the day after their wedding. You better not miss it. Adi. I have a plan. Let's go out on a short trip tomorrow. Guess where we're going? To Dandeli! What say? Tomorrow I'm going to Mumbai. Mumbai? But why? Tomorrow night's Dia's reception. The wedding's day after. I thought of going and.. Don't forget to join the luncheon with their family. Anyways you love meat in your food. Lakki, she's leaving to Singapore after her marriage. So? So.. I thought of seeing her for one last time. Adi, this is an excuse. You're not accepting the reality. You're still hoping that Dia will become yours. Put that out of your mind right away! It's all over! Fine. If at all Dia sees you at the reception.. Have you thought how awakward she would feel? I told you that I'll only see her and return. Not that I will meet her. But still, don't go. You'll be hurt if you go there and see all of that. Don't! If it's meant to, let that happen too. I'll become a stronger person, mentally. Enough of you being strong. If you're out there witnessing that, it'll feel.. ...as if thousand persons are stabbing me with knives. Be it joy or grief, it's not just you who experiences it. You know that, right? You're not going. That is it. Get some sleep. From now on, Dia's topic should never ever come up between us. Good night. I'm sorry dear. For the first time ever, I'm asking you not to do something you wanted to. This is for our good. Adi wake up! It's time. Adi? Hello Adi, where are you? - I'm sorry Lakki. For the first time ever I'm going against your words. I'm going to Mumbai. Bye. Adi! Hello? Adi? Idiot. I'm in Mumbai. I told you, right? Oh! Brother. When did you come down? And what are you wearing? I never thought that I would meet you. Nothing. - Okay. Did you meet Dia? Not yet. I'll meet her later. It's a bit crowded now. So what? We've come from far away. They should give importance to us over others. Let's go talk to her. Let's do it later! - It's okay, brother. Smitha! Let's not do this! You both look good together. You both are made for each other. Thank you. Sir! How about a picture? Once again wish you all the best. Thank you! Please have your dinner. Definitely. It's been days since I had a proper meal. Do you know him? We're done right? How much longer do we have to be here? We'll be done in another fifteen minutes. Harish uncle and family are on the way. There's a traffic jam apparently. Until then you may.. Look how dull she looks. Cheer her up! Geetha? - I'm coming. Keep her engaged. I'll be back. If any one of us wish to say 'I love you' to each other.. I.. Love.. You..! We need to press each other's hand thrice. I.. Love.. You..! You know how to reply, right I never should've recovered. All three of us would have lived peacefully. You went to end your life because I was no more. But he's given you a new lease of life. He's even taught you to live without me. If you unite with me, you'll only continue to live your life. But with him, you'll enjoy your life. So.. This is for your own good. It's hurting just to say it. Go! Instead of the both of you suffering because of me.. It's better that I suffer for the both of you, right? Please go! I shall return to Singapore by myself again. How are you? Is Adi inside? Don't you know what happened? What is it? She suffered a massive cardiac arrest. If only someone was home, there were chances of her surviving. Unfortunately, no one was around. Nanjamma too was out of the town. We constantly tried reaching you. But your phone was switched off. Can you tell everyone to go out for five minutes? Do you know why I always call you as Lakki? Every time I call you as Lakki,.. I constantly remind myself how lucky I am to have been born as your son. Thank you Lakki! Thank you for being my mother! I shouldn't have.. left you! You told me not to.. I don't like it when you buy things. But I love buying things for you. If you're out there witnessing that, it'll feel.. ...as if thousand persons are stabbing me with knives. If only someone was home, there were chances of her surviving. Adi? Where is he? Mother? Oh! Shankara? Are you done with Lakshmi madam's organ donation formalities? Yes. It's all done. And Adi? Is he still here? No. He left after finishing all the procedures. He left? Do you know where he went? - No idea. He didn't tell me anything. ADI! Did you come across my friend, Adi? Adi who? Our Doctor madam's son? The one I introduced you to, at the hospital. Oh him! I'd forgotten his name. Yeah! I did see him. You did? Where was it? God! I became responsible for my mother's death. She taught me everything. But not how to live without her. I want peace! Everlasting peace! I think I'll get it only if.. In the end, I pray for only one thing. Make sure that Dia's always happy and peaceful. Adi! Dia?
