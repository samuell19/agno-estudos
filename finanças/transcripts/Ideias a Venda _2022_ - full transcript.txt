A NETFLIX SERIES That's the movement. The race is tight. -Are you moved? -I feel like crying. They say Brazilian creativity should be the subject of a study. We want to see new, big shot ideas. Good ideas are waiting for the right time to be launched. Here, beyond being studied, it is rewarded. Thank God the audience gets to decide. We have four people in the boxes. One hundred people in the audience, excited to vote and award them 200,000 reais. -It's almost a tie. -In Jesus' name. It's never happened on the show. It's just a bombastic mess. Contestants are put to the test, under the watchful eyes of experts… The rules are clear. One of them must go. And one businesswoman who guides how the labor market is engaged with the anti-racist agenda. We also think about the social impact. Don't just dream about the future. You should make it happen now. With every new step, the chances increase. They must move the Big Shot Game Show lever to place the final bet. The decision is yours. It's all or nothing. Have they made the right decision? This is The Big Shot. Here, if you want to be successful, you must think outside the box. Ready to go on with the show. Can I have some water? Place your bets. Welcome! My name is Eliana. And this is The Big Shot Game Show. We brought four entrepreneurs here… HOST …to compete for the prize that will make a product shine. The competition takes place on the stage, and the 100 members of the audience will decide who deserves to get 200,000. That's why the owners of the money are ready to go! So, which contestant will leave with a loaded bank account and a product on the rise? I'm telling you right now, this will be thrilling, because the entrepreneurs are excited to present their products for the pet market. They also have to win the judges over. They will closely observe every detail. Luana Génot, a powerful woman, does not romanticize entrepreneurship. SOCIAL ENTREPRENEUR She's always here at The Big Shot Game Show. And Luisa Mell, Enzo's mother, an activist who loves pets. She is our guest today to form the panel. PRESIDENT, LUISA MELL INSTITUTE -Welcome! -Thank you. Thank you. I hope these entrepreneurs win us over throughout the challenges. Let's meet the people behind these creations. Check it out. Hi, Fernanda! No way! God, I can't believe it! You were chosen to compete for our show's grand prize. -Are you serious? -Two hundred thousand reais! Wow, it would be amazing. -Are you ready? -Locked and loaded. Gabriel loves going on adventures on his bike, especially if his four-legged friend comes along. That's why he created a product that went viral. I've done everything, from selling things online to delivery services. So it goes. Carol has adopted a pet, and her life changed. Theo is her inspiration to make treats with exclusive ingredients. Our interaction with pets must be affectionate, it must be of equality and trust. Fernanda designs stylish products for dogs. And she did not forget items for those with special needs. The idea is to be inclusive, to help animals, in any stage of their lives to have quality of life. Thiago created an online accessory store to protect people from the rain, and found out that some pets don't like to get wet. I saved people from the rain all day long, but I couldn't prevent my loving pet from getting wet. That's when I found out there are several products I could create for my clients and for their dogs as well. So, who will make it to the final? In the first round, four people will take a close look at the products, while the entrepreneurs are locked in the boxes and can't say anything. In this round, the products must sell themselves. So, one of them will be eliminated from The Big Shot Game Show on a first-impression basis. FIRST IMPRESSION But there is an important detail. Your products will be assessed by your rivals. Get ready to say everything you're thinking or not, okay? It depends on your strategy to do well in this round. The first of the four products we're going to see is… Yellow Pet! Nice. So, let's decide who will review Gabriel's product. Fernanda, you'll disclose your first impression of your rival, okay? -Can I touch it? -Sure, go ahead. As if you're analyzing it to buy. The first thing I look for is if it's comfortable for the pet. And my first… My first reaction is that it clearly is of good quality. It's well made. I should stop saying good things. Fernanda, does it seem fragile? Does it look strong enough for animals of any size? It seems robust. -It does? -Yes. Great. Would you buy it for your pet? It wouldn't work for me, because my dogs are huge. They're mammoths. So it doesn't work for larger dogs? I think it would be harder to carry larger dogs, but… Perhaps you'd like to put it on, so we can see it. It's quite easy to… -Is it easy? -Easy to put on. Guys, I'd love this. It's cool, right? Take your pet for a walk. I want to know if they're safe, without the risk of being strangled. If they jump out, they could be strangled. I can't see it from here, so I need your help. I think it's quite safe, because there is… The structure around the neck is pretty high. And this X on the back here is important. If it were any different, it wouldn't feel so safe. They really thought the design through. Do you see anything that could be improved right off the bat? I would change some of the materials to make it better. Thanks, Fernanda. Carol, come over here. Carol, I want to know your honest opinion about Cuscoloko, okay? It has many fasteners, right? But the finish is very good, it's very nice. I'm worried if this would hurt, and how the animal would feel wearing this equipment. If it would feel comfortable. I think it's practical for the owner, but I'm not sure if it is so for the pet. Would this be comfortable and practical for the pet? Were you easily able to understand how to use it? No. Not really. There are many fasteners. I don't know how to put it on, I need a manual. A more detailed explanation on how to use it. Can you pull it up? The owner will have back pain. I don't get it. Is it to go outside and exercise, or for physical therapy? -What do you think? -There's another strap. -Oh, I hadn't seen that one. -I don't know… Maybe it's like this. Don't think so! -It'll ruin your back. -Like a purse. -I didn't quite understand it. -Look… But it matched your outfit. -It did, right? -To go for a walk… A nice purse to carry my dog. It's perfect. It's so cute. I think the dynamics are a bit confusing. -Okay, Carol. Thank you. -Thank you. All right! Thiago Fazzoletti, come over here. Thiago, the products are displayed. You can take a look. At first glance, it seems to be a premium product. It seems to be very well made. Great packaging, congrats. I even feel like eating these, but that wouldn't be appropriate. Well, if you want to taste it, go ahead. -I won't. Thank you. -No? -No, I will not. -Too bad. Maybe if I were really hungry. I'll taste it. Yeah? Okay. -Right? -Eliana, offer us some! It's so cute. I think these… Aren't these for humans? -We can both try. -No, Eliana. We'll eat together. Wait. Fine, I'll try some too. I'm shocked! -See? -You owe me one. -Want it? -Yeah. It's "dog-licious." It's "dog-licious." You've said great things about this product, but does it have any flaws? I think… Sorry. Can I have some water? Maybe in a bowl? So you'll lick it, right? When you have a puppy, you could give them this as a treat, but it's important not to base their diet on this. But does the packaging say that? That it's a treat? -It doesn't say. -It's okay to eat? -It's so well done. -It does say it! Got it. What was your first impression, Thiago? It's a premium product, it looks expensive. It doesn't seem to be processed, it seems to be made with great care, judging by the package. Perfect. -Okay. -Thanks. Thank you. Well, it's time for Gabriel from Yellow Pet to talk about your product, Thiago. Come over here, Gabriel. Let's see… -Did you figure it out? -I did. This is probably for the harness, right? Which means this must be to protect the dog. But what stands out for me is that it may not be functional. If there was a dog here during a storm, you could stumble on the umbrella. The product is well made. Personally, I would prefer a raincoat. It's more functional. But it's a cool product. It would look cute in photos. You carry a big umbrella and your dog has his. It's a good look. Yeah, it's cool. -But in everyday life… -It's not functional. That's the way I see it. Gabriel, tell me. Does it work for pets of different sizes? I guess a larger dog… Like, I have a shepherd. It would be more complicated. She's long, I'd have to be like this. I think it's a bit complicated. I'm kind of confused. In theory, it's great. It would make a great photo. But what dog lets you lead like this? All the dogs I know move around, sniff around. -It won't cover them. -Yes, indeed. I am having a hard time. What do you think? I don't really understand. Maybe he can explain better. It looks good, but it's not functional. Perfect. Okay? Perfect! Well, it's elimination time. The decision is up to the 100 people here. First, I'd like to know what the judges have to say. Luana, how did the entrepreneurs do? What are your thoughts? I think that some of them were very kind, you know… They were being cautious. "This is a nice product." But competition can be cruel. The market isn't always accepting. Luisa, we can tell their ideas are quite different. Yes, I'm curious to learn more from the entrepreneurs. Some things I didn't get. I'm very curious. Well, it's time for the audience to vote. One of these boxes won't open the doors of their business. You can cast your vote now. Voting is over. VOTE RECEIVED The audience shared their opinion. One of these boxes was chosen by… seventy-eight people. Wow. You're responsible for this. Who is not moving forward on The Big Shot Game Show? Fazzoletti, you got the most votes from the 100 people in the audience. Thiago is leaving The Big Shot Game Show. And we'll finally open up the boxes! Great. Congratulations! You should celebrate. This was just the first step. There are still many thrills ahead. There's 200,000 at stake. And it only depends on you to get to the final and compete for the prize. From now on, the entrepreneurs leave the boxes to tell us a little bit about them, and put their ideas to work. Now, to decide who did better, here's our panel. Judges, you'll have a chance to scrutinize each one of them, their products, their stories, as they compete for this prize. There's money at stake. From the three open boxes, two will make it to the final with 25,000 reais in the bank. To continue fighting for the 200,000, they need to show their plans in action. They have to sell their idea. SELL YOUR IDEA To make things more exciting, the audience can react in real time with thumbs up or down during the presentations. We start with Cuscoloko. Fernanda, the stage is yours. After all these years on the market, we were able to understand the real requirements of owners of pets with special needs, older pets, or pets in rehabilitation. It's not intended for walks. It's a therapeutic product. We were very careful with the materials. It's a company policy. We don't use plastic, we use nontoxic, hypoallergenic rubber. A product like this is all about inclusion and accessibility to make it easier on owners and their pets. I wanted to go beyond trendy products. My idea was to drive the domestic market and value local labor, to work with sustainable materials, and to support the art of our country. I'm here today to show you that we won't change the world with just cool prints, but by promoting accessibility. What is making you emotional right now? It's knowing that we will actually help. We've spent some time in a rehabilitation clinic. I realized that we had to do this. "This doesn't exist? How could the market not care?" So, that was a life-changing moment. It changed our lives. Let's see if the audience liked your explanation. Let's see. Look. The audience liked it. -They like it. Great. Now, we need to know if our judges, Luana and Luisa, have any questions. Fernanda, you talk really well. You have a purpose, which is great. You talked about inclusion, accessibility. But I want to know, what is the main obstacle for you? You're here because you want to make a difference. So tell me about that. It's visibility. A product like this has to reach the market. It's an underserved market. People need to provide accessibility to animals with special needs. There's the wheelchair. Tell us. Why not the chair? Why this instead? Which cases, specifically? It's not a substitute for the wheelchair. This product does not replace the wheelchair. My pet is just old. He needs help to get up, it's a booster. It can be used in rehabilitation? In the tank. The material is coated, so it doesn't rust. You can use it in a tank for physical therapy. When the dog gets well, you don't need it anymore? If the dog gets better, you don't need it. But this is useful for aging pets. We know that the lifespan of pets is longer nowadays. Some elderly dogs will need this. And we have such a nice project that we do not… Cuscoloko became a facilitator, and that is pretty cool. We collect the product that is no longer in use and donate it. We get the product to people who can't afford it and need it. -Thank you. -Thank you. It's your turn, Carol. Sell your idea. People, my food is 100% natural. There's no preservatives or coloring, no chemical additives. They are gluten, lactose, and sugar free. We created it with the health of pets in mind. We also have a pet bakery. We make cakes, dog donuts, and dog pastries. They're seasonal products, popular during the holidays. I can say Apheto was created when I adopted Theo. I was a lawyer, studying to be a public servant. I was focused, but he led me to the path of entrepreneurship. Theo has an allergy called atopy, an allergic hypersensitivity. Depending on what he ate, his condition would get worse. Searching for treatments, I met Leonardo, his vet, and my partner in Apheto. Together, we had the idea and found that a natural diet was an alternative for Theo and a solution for many who want to avoid processed food. It's hard to find premium, healthy products that look good and that are really healthy. The act of giving a treat, this sensory experience is amazing. Apheto wants to convey the idea that you can sit with your dog and eat the same thing they're eating. We fight over these at home. Is it for the dog or for us? -I swear. -Very good. Let's see if you won the audience over. Look. Good job! The audience loved it. Listen, we've seen everything. Especially Luisa. You must've seen everything that's pet-related, and you just saw a product that the owner can feed the dog and eat it too. You like it? Eating with the dog makes me a bit concerned. You'll be having lunch and the dog will want your food. And we don't want that. The relationship gets complicated. And I was wondering… No preservatives, no coloring. How can you turn this into a business? How can you avoid it from going bad on a larger scale? Explain that to me. We created a recipe for treats that has a 90-day shelf life. It's a great span for a product without preservatives. However, we want to use natural preservatives, that are safe and are not harmful to dogs or cats. Is Apheto covering its costs? Is this a sustainable project on the long run? Today, Apheto covers its costs. It's not where I'd like it to be yet. And that's why I'm here. To give it more visibility, so that people get to know my product and that I can grow financially as well. All right. From what I can see, there is cake… -There is. -A few appetizers. Not only does it have the advantage of being natural, but you're also very concerned, from what I see, with the way they look. Very much. Is that to please humans or their pets? Humans, of course. And here's Yellow Pet. Gabriel, you're the last one in this round. Our product is made with premium materials, because we're not carrying objects, we're carrying love. My dream was to safely carry my dog. This dream began on August 6th, 2017, on the banks of the Reservoir of Guarapiranga. My friends and I used to bike. On that day, we found a crate and a dirty yellow dog in it. I picked her up and she smiled. A cyclist was born. Since then, I dream of creating a manufacturer of adventure pet products. The difference between our backpack and the pouches that people traditionally use is the structure. Inside we have a plastic plate that makes the product sturdy. It makes this U shape, following the dog's anatomy in a natural position. It's simple to position your pet. Get their hind legs, insert them in the backpack. Once the dog's seated, you get these straps… You cross them like an X. There. This is the icing on the cake. We have the goggles. Let's put the goggles on, Yellow? Here, my princess. Here. That's right. And here is Yellow! My God, that's so cute. Wearing the backpack is quite simple. You grab this. I give it support and, with this hand, I push it backwards on my back. The other strap. If you just fasten this… All set. Your little bundle of love is ready for a ride or anything. Let's see if the audience's thermometer is going up or down. Let's see. Give him a thumbs up or down. -Look at that! They liked it. -Thanks, everyone. Luana and Luisa, ask away. It was an interesting presentation. You seem to be a very engaged entrepreneur. What is your main obstacle today as the person in charge of Yellow? The materials are very expensive. And skilled labor as well. Since this is a backpack for you to carry not objects, but love, we need properly skilled labor to deliver a premium product. Everything is handcrafted. A young man who lives down my street owns a clothing factory. Luisa, would you use this kind of backpack? -Look… -For your pet? My dogs are huge. They wouldn't fit. What's the maximum weight? Do you know? The maximum weight the backpack can take is 35kg. -But that… -We have XL. You can carry them. -Help! -You need a strong back. It takes preparation. It's fine on a motorcycle. Sitting on a motorcycle, this part is automatically supported, so it can be done. -Your dog is an angel, right? -She is. From here, it seems easy and simple to get a dog quietly in a backpack wearing goggles. But I know many different dogs. I know it's not so easy for a dog to stay like that. I want to understand your public. Do they get to test it? Is there dog training for this? Just like any other product, the backpack needs some getting used to. It usually takes three days. When you start taking the pets outside and they start sniffing all around them… Imagine you're on a bike or just walking around, they can smell different places. The dog goes nuts and thinks, "I want to ride in this backpack." What does it mean to you to be here on The Big Shot Game Show, and maybe being able to improve your creation and expand your business? I come from the hood. My bicycle has changed my life. It was because of it that I found Yellow on a trail. It was an opportunity to escape the life of crime that exists in my area. People would say, "Your son isn't going to be a good kid." Being here is very emotional to me. -It's a victory. -Making mama proud. -Gabriel, you can step out. -Thank you. The competition goes on. Two of them will go to the final of The Big Shot Game Show. One will be eliminated by the judges. What a difficult decision. Right, Luana and Luisa? I want to say the three of you really moved me. They are so dedicated to improving the lives of animals. I want to thank all three of you. I think that you will all go far with the passion you have. Luana. Entrepreneurship is a journey with its ups and downs. And no matter what happens here, each of you should stick to your goal. To your ultimate goal, which is your product. So, don't give up. Well, whoever gets through this round gets 25,000 reais in the bank. If you're eliminated, you get nothing. The judges have made a decision. I want to know what was the decisive factor for your choice. Luana. We have assessed the business model. We also assessed the product scalability, for example, and what could happen in the long run. We've considered these factors. We know that some are further developed than others. Considering all of these factors, Luisa, was it an easy decision? No, I'm as nervous as they are. It's hard to judge. It's time for the judges' decision. Luana, please cast your vote. APHETO Fernanda, Gabriel, you are our finalists! Yeah! Thank you. Each of you have won 25,000 reais. Soon, you'll be able to bet all or nothing for the grand prize of 200,000. Before the audience decides who deserves to win the grand prize, I want to hear from you, Fernanda. I noticed you got very emotional that you are a finalist. What does this mean to you, Fernanda? I do everything with my soul and with my heart. I'm very happy and very proud that I'm here and made it to the final. We can see your passion. I'm getting emotional. Good luck. Thank you. Gabriel, why is it important for you that the boy from the hood has come this far to fulfill your dream of showing your project to thousands of people? What's going through your head right now? I didn't expect to be here. This money will help the company grow, scale up the product, and provide a better life for my family. For me, it's a dream come true to be closer to doing that and to give them a better life. That's beautiful, Gabriel. -Thank you. -You're in the final. To dispel any doubts, and to heat things up a bit, in this round of the competition you will go face-to-face with your competition. FACE-TO-FACE WITH THE COMPETITION Fernanda, you go first. You may confront the competition. I had one question during your presentation. You mentioned that the supplies, the materials, and labor are very expensive. How will you manufacture it? Abroad or will you stick to artisan production? You said we'd be carrying love. That's my question. Do you intend to keep your current production or not? I didn't really understand it. So, the issue with production, to scale up a product, you need quantity. And you need to get a better price. As an entrepreneur, you know that. We can say that my short-term goal is to import materials, probably from China, everyone buys from them, and manufacture it here for now. Because in spite of everything, we give jobs to a few people in Brazil. -Okay, Gabriel. -Thank you. It's your turn to confront your competition. Go ahead. What makes your chest harness, which helps dogs, stand out from an orthopedic harness currently on the market? Why would a professional orthopedist or physical therapist choose your product instead of others on the market? Precisely because there's nothing like it on the market. We are pioneers with such a complete project, using such resistant materials. We produce domestically. Our materials are bought in Brazil. We want to drive the economy and to value local labor, like you mentioned. -That is Cuscoloko's purpose. -Okay. All right, you can return to your boxes. Luana. How did they do with the questions? Were they bold and challenging? They touched on central issues both products need to work on. The raw materials, communicating their uniqueness… They did great. Luisa, did you expect anything else from them? No, they're both amazing people. They both moved me as individuals. She is passionate about animals like I am. Both have amazing ideas and have a bright future. I'm sure of it. -Thank you. -Very well. Audience, it's up to you now. We know it's not easy to make decisions like this. I know. That's why I'm sure that the entrepreneurs who are fighting for the prize gave their very best. They deserve to be on our stage. Audience, it's in your hands. Earlier, you voted to eliminate one box. Now, you'll choose which one of them deserves to win 200,000 to expand their business. Who did better today? Only one will take the grand prize. You have ten decisive seconds. Audience, you can cast your votes. Who's the winner, Fernanda or Gabriel? Eighty-two members of the audience have selected one of these boxes to win 200,000. Fernanda and Gabriel, one of you will take the prize. Use your intuition and your intelligence in the final bet. FINAL BET Fernanda and Gabriel, each one of you has 25,000 reais in the bank. You now get to decide what you'll do with the money. On The Big Shot Game Show, you must use your head to win the 200,000. And you also have to use the lever inside the boxes. By pushing the lever forward, you state that you're confident that you got the most votes from the audience and you bet everything for the 200,000 reais. By pulling the lever backwards, you get to keep the 25,000 reais in the bank. You give up the grand prize. The decision is yours to make. Move the lever when I tell you to. It's all or nothing. My God… Think carefully, because your decision may change the history of your product. Oh my God! Place the final bet now! You both went all in for the prize, but only one was chosen by the audience. One of you goes home with 200,000, the other goes home with nothing. Who made the right choice? We'll find out now. The prize of 200,000 reais is yours, Gabriel! R$ 200,000 Thank you, everyone! -Thank you. -Congratulations. Thank you for making my dream come true. Mom, this is for you! Yellow Pet takes 200,000 home. -Thank you, Lord! -Good luck, Gabriel. Thank you, guys. Thank you. Thank you. Congratulations, Gabriel. Thank you, audience. You rocked! Thank you, Luisa Mell. Thank you, Luana. Did you have fun? Watch the other episodes of The Big Shot Game Show. -Bye! -Thank you! Thank you. Subtitle translation by: Marcio Romani
