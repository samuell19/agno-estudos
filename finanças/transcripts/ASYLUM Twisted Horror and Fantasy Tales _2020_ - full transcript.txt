Good afternoon, my darling sons of bitches! Let me introduce myself. My name is Brandon and I'll be trying to entertain you over the next hour. You've probably never heard of me that wouldn't be a surprise because I'm nobody. They say time flies when you're having fun so this would seem like forever because my jokes suck. But please stay until the end we have so much to talk about and I have a surprise for you. Let me tell you a story about how I came to be here. Once upon a time I was married to a beautiful woman named Phillipa. She was everything you could hope for in a woman she was adorable everybody loved her. All our friends however wondered what is she doing with an jerk like me? And they were right. I was a shy, boring guy obsessed with my work stuck in my ways, who never had anything interesting to say. Are there any accountants out there? We really are the most boring mother fuckers you know. Did you hear the story about the woman that went to the doctor for a check-up? The doctor told her she only had six months left to live. She's crying, she's desperate, she said: Doctor there must be something I could do. "Sure," said the doctor, "You could marry an accountant." "What? Would it make me live longer?" "No," said the doctor "But he will make your last six months here seem like an eternity." So one day Phillipa woke up and thought to herself, They're right. I am beautiful and adorable and I do shine like a star on a cloudless night. What am I doing with this jerk? So she dropped me like a hot tamale and this tamale fell far. I'd never been with another woman besides Phillipa and when she left me, I was alone, and hopeless. And then one day I found a flyer on the ground that said, "Stand up!" And here I stand. Don't I kill as a comedian? Are you having a good time? Let me tell you a story about George C. Parker. Have you heard of him? He was a legendary con man in New York City. Who could sell anything to anyone. The turn of the 20th century he became infamous for selling rich tourists the Brooklyn bridge. They say he even sold one Russian billionaire the Statue of Liberty. Well right now I feel like George C. fucking Parker, so listen very carefully because I have tremendous, fabulous, wonderful stories to sell you. [♪♪♪] [snoring] [buzzing] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [grunting] How was that? Is that like too much gurgling or? Uh no, no, no. It was fine. Oh hey any chance I could get my SAG card after this? Yeah, and I'll be getting my acceptance letter to the Director's Guild any day now. [chuckles] Hey look on the bright side. You get to work with the world-famous Father Lance. You'll be saved from the forces of darkness in front of millions of viewers! Where do you want the rest of these cables? They're fine where they are just make sure you're wired up and don't, forget to mic up our starlet here. [♪♪♪] Do you want me to moan more? I can, like no problem. You're doing fine, Hailey. Okay.

I am Father Lance, your guide through these troubling times. Tonight, we bring you Sabrina. An innocent soul, tortured by the only family she'd ever known. Molested by her father, beaten by her mother Sabrina sought escape from her unimaginable pain, in the form of drugs, alcohol and ultimately, prostitution. [girl 2] 'Cause he's rich Well, not just 'cause he's rich! Well anyway, so it's Josh or Kyle. [father Lance] The enemy of God exploited her frailty, and took control of her body, but tonight by the grace of God with my help and your prayers. Sabrina will be rid of this evil! [snoring] [Drew] Okay, that's great, Heather! [Drew] Keep your head down, whatever they can't see will terrify them. In nomine Patris et Filium et Spiritum Sanctum. [Drew] All right, great Heather, now try and bite him. [grunting] Sabrina is exhibiting incredible strength and aggression. This could be a stage four possession. [grunting] I command you, unclean spirit by the mysteries of the incarnation, hatched in the resurrection and the ascension of our Lord Jesus Christ that you tell me your name and obey me to the letter! Speak your name, demon! Okay, Heather your demon name is Slubgob. Repeat: Slubgob. [father Lance] Your name, demon. Speak! [roaring] Damn, Heather, very nice! Tell me your name, in the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ! [growling] We are Thoth. Collector of fractured souls! Soon we'll be thousands in number. Limitless in strength! Just go with it, she said her name was Thoth. Uh, Heather I appreciate your enthusiasm, but please stick to the script. [screaming] [father Lance] Our Father, who art in heaven. Hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come. What on Earth are you two watching? Are you seeing this? [father Lance] Thoth. Abhor and slime of Hell, servant of Satan. See the cross of the Lord Jesus and submit to the authority of the Almighty! [grunting] Fight Sabrina! [grunting] Fight! [grunting] Do not give in! Fight! [grunting] [♪♪♪] That wasn't me. Must've slipped. Fuck you, deceiver! Fuck you for all of the masses! You will take the world and the bounty it provides. You're nothing but a pawn in the eyes of the Great One! Silence! Silence, demon! I cast you out in the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ! [screaming] Be gone and depart from Sabrina, who is but an innocent creature of God! For it is He who commands you. [father Lance] He who flung you from the heights of Heaven to the depths of Hell! What the fuck? Is that you? [devilish laughter] [thudding] Hearken therefore and tremble in fear. [thudding] For you are at the mercy of the creator of all things! [thudding] Submit and depart from us! [groaning] [roaring] [breathing deeply] Holy shit! Heather? [growling] [howling] [Drew] We've got a problem, something's wrong Heather? Heather! I don't think she's acting! [roaring] I got to end transmission! Don't you dare! Look at the numbers! Help me, Father Lance! Please! [sobbing] We've got to fix this! [Heather crying] Don't break the fourth one! 13 million people are gonna watch this girl die. Who do you think they're gonna blame? Help me, Father Lance. Give me the book! I'm the exorcist, right? [crying] Read it out loud. Yeah. [devilish laughter] Help me, Father Lance! [Heather taking deep breaths] [devilish laughter] [Heather taking deep breaths] Repel [groaning] Repel, O Lord the devil's power. [growling] Break asunder his snares and traps [grunting and panting] Put the unholy tempter to flight [roaring] I cast you out, demon! Be gone, be gone, be gone! Depart from us in the name of Jesus Christ! [crying] Be gone! [screaming] [slow breathing] Sabrina? [gasping] Are you with us? [slow breathing] Sabrina? [father Lance] Sabrina, are you with us? [♪♪♪] S-Sabrina? [father Lance] Sabrina, are you... are you with us? [panting] Are you with us? [roaring] [screaming] [groaning] Get her off me! [grunting] [thudding and crashing] [grunting] [father Lance] Drew! Help! [Drew] I'll get her legs! [Drew] I'll get her legs! [Drew] What the fuck? [Drew] Got her legs! [Drew] I got her legs! [father Lance] What the fuck? [groaning] [indistinct chatter] [♪♪♪] [groans] What happened? Did I do a good job? [groaning] You did good, Heather. You did good. I did it. I fucking did it! [taking deep breaths] [♪♪♪] [girl 3] We have to take a selfie before we go! [indistinct chatter] [♪♪♪] Bitch! I am not. [♪♪♪] So God created man in his image. And then he created women. And he said unto them fruitful and multiply and populate the Earth and subdue it. And so we did. We fucked like rabbits. Populated the planet. And fucked it all up! [groaning] Out of the mouths of babes and The Bible. [shouting] Words hurt huh? [growling] Man's words hurt even more, because they're filled with nothing more than lies and bad intentions. Why don't you just give up, and let the demon into your body? [grunting] And you, demon! [roaring] Why do you hesitate to enter this woman? She's not as bad as the others. Jesus, being an exorcist is really tough! I mean a real nightmare. We used to have to convince the demon out of the body. But now we are so fucked up they're too scared to possess us! Of course, it's all God's fault. He's a workaholic. I mean he could've been like everyone else and worked Monday to Friday but no, he's an overachieving asshole who wanted to work six days a week and only rest on Sundays. We could've been so cool but he was in such a rush now. He made us human. There are many others like him that take things too seriously. Work more than they need to slaves to their job. These workaholics are the ones you have to watch especially the evil ones. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [wolf howling] That was fucking creepy. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] Hello? Hello? [♪♪♪] Hello [♪♪♪] [Dave] Hello, Mia Dave? [Dave] Sorry, my fucking Bluetooth. What are you doing? [Dave] Well I'm talking to you on the phone and driving over to your place. You know you're late by the way. [Dave] Yeah well, I might have had to make a stop. What for? [Dave] I got you something. [Mia] Last time I got a gift from you, it was football tickets. [Dave] Yeah, and those were really good seats. You know I don't watch football. [Dave] What? What do you mean you don't watch football, since when? That was a fun day. I got us on the kiss cam. We had beers, I got you those fucking nachos you wanted. Being romantic is not your thing. [chuckles] [Dave] Okay, I'll be there soon. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [gasping] Come on, come on, don't hit me. What the fuck is wrong with you? Are you on fucking steroids or what? Oh my gosh! That is what you get for being an idiot. Oh my gosh, you're so adorable when you're upset. What if I had a knife in my hand? What if you had a knife in your hand? I don't know, what would happen? Maybe you'd stab me cut me right here, and I'd get blood all over you. You'd get all wet. I got you a bear. You are so creepy. His name is Bill. Bill? Mhm. Bill is not a cute name for a bear. I think it's a cute name for a bear. [chuckles] And I got you flowers. Does that make up for it? Am I romantic enough for you? Yeah? I like how my shirt looks on you by the way. Really? It's pretty hot. Yeah? But I am going to need it back right now. I need you to take it off. Oh! Should I just take it off? Like right now, yeah. Yeah, just like right now. Yeah, like right now. That's good, that's a good start. A couple more buttons [gasping] [grunting] [screaming] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [sobbing] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [telephone operator] 911, where is your emergency? [Mia] Oh my God, please! [Mia] Help me, he's coming after me. [taking deep breaths] [Mia] What do you want? [taking deep breaths] [grunting] [♪♪♪] [grunting] [♪♪♪] [taking deep breaths] [♪♪♪] [exhales] [sighs] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [grunting] [grunting] [grunting] [crunching] [sniffing] [grunting] [laughing] [grunting] [♪♪♪] [grunting] [screaming] [grunting] [hissing] [grunting] [grunting] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [growling] [screaming] [grunting] [groaning] [♪♪♪] [munching] [♪♪♪] [groaning] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [grunting] [♪♪♪] [gasping] [taking deep breaths] [♪♪♪] [taking deep breaths] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [screaming] [♪♪♪] [screaming] [grunting] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [squeaking] [burping] Sorry, I haven't had breakfast. Anyway, back to the story of Phillipa. I always wanted to be a father. I wanted children with all my heart. But Phillipa didn't. She was perfect being pregnant would ruin her figure. And she would probably lose followers on Instagram. After we divorced Phillipa quickly moved on and started dating some other asshole. Who was even more boring than me. A year later she fell pregnant. So what the hell happened there? Perhaps Phillipa thought she would get more likes and comments if she was holding a puppy. She always liked to do it doggy style. She probably thought she was gonna have puppies. [audience laughing] I loved her dearly but she was too shallow. Too dependant on her appearance. I mean, you can't blame her. Who isn't these days? A culture based on appearances and hypocrisy. That's what this is! Perhaps that's why I'm here. Because I wasn't true to myself. But No more! Now it's a time to change. Now it's time to be free. [♪♪♪] It's nice we can choose the clothes together. We're so lucky not everybody can do that. [woman 1] It'll be big on you, but I'd like you to wear my father's suit. What do you think? I don't care. I'll wear whatever. No, you must look smart. It's an important day for me. Lots of people are coming, you must look perfect. Then just choose my clothes for me. I'm not in the mood. Shoes? The brown ones are nicer, right? Those ones rub and give me sores. I prefer the black ones. These ones. They're newer. They're newer because I never wear them. They rub. Then put some plasters on. Why ask me which shoes I want if you're going to choose them yourself? Which tie? I like these two. I don't like wearing a tie. I never wear a tie. It's not my style. Style! Style What's your style? You look like a rustic. I am a rustic and I like the way I look, okay? Shave that beard off. You're not going with that great beard. You're not touching my great beard. I was practically born with a beard. You met me with this beard. That beard is going and that's that. Don't you dare I mean it, okay? Darling. That beard. That beard it's disgusting. It doesn't suit you. It never has. These clothes that we're choosing you'll be wearing for eternity. We don't have much time so make an effort and help me with all of this. You're the star. Lots of people are coming to see you one last time at your wake. So I want you to look handsome and radiant. They'll think that I've dressed you badly because you're a simple villager. But that's what I am. That's how I want people to remember me. With my shirts with tracksuit bottoms and, above all with my beard. Don't touch my beard, okay? I have to get the flowers the coffin and call the last guests. The burial is in three days. So don't be selfish. Cooperate a little, please. Darling why don't you just wait until I die and you can do it as you like. Darling, I don't like to remind you but the doctor said you have less than 48 hours left. What if he's wrong? He won't be wrong. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [woman 2] He looks so smart. Are the clothes his? Or are they from the funeral home? [woman 1] It's my father's suit. We chose it together for the occasion. Rest assured, dear. He's more handsome dead than he was alive. A little too much make-up though, don't you think? If not he'd be white and would give us the chills but I think it's a complete waste of time. He'll start to rot in a few hours. [woman 2] He looks better without a beard. He looks younger. He's unrecognizable without it. He looks gay. I always told him to shave. Without that beard, he's so handsome. He looks like a fairy. Why did you shave him? It was one of his last requests. [sobbing] If you don't mind, could you join the others? I'd like to be alone with him. [♪♪♪] [kisses] [♪♪♪] - Darling! - [screaming] [taking fast breaths] What the hell are you doing alive? I don't know. [husband] I just woke up. My God, what a shock. How can this be? The doctor confirmed your death a few hours ago. He confirmed it badly then. Because, as you can see, I'm alive. I feel absolutely fine. We're burying you in an hour. Your friends are here, it's all ready. Even people who don't like you came. We'll cancel it that's that. I'll go out right now and explain it all. Are you crazy? It's been a lot of trouble. There are hundreds of people. There are high expectations. That many people came? It's a success. I've always been a popular guy. [sobbing] They'll be happy I'm alive. Darling I'm your wife and I love you but it's too late now. We're used to the idea now. What do you mean? We can't lose face. We'd look stupid. I'd be a laughing stock. There's a lot at stake. What do you mean? You have to die. You can't just resurrect like this. Are you serious? Of course. Shit You can't do this to me. Juan, don't talk back to me. Your mother is here. My parents are on their way. When they arrive, they want you dead and buried. We can't let them down. I don't want to die yet. [sobbing] I'm not ready. Darling. Do you love me? Yes. Well, if you really love me die. You want me to kill myself? [♪♪♪] My little boy. My little boy's gone. [kissing] Faustina, don't fuss over him you'll crease his suit. Goodness me. He's so handsome without his beard. You shaved my beard in the end. What are you doing alive? I don't know but I've woken up. See? Fresh as a daisy. It's a miracle! - Yes. - [kissing] Of course, I said that to her: "It's a miracle", but now I want to go outside and give everybody the good news. But she won't let me. She says I have to die. He wants to cancel the funeral. He says he doesn't want to be buried until he's dead. Cancel the funeral? Are you crazy? Do you know the amount of people here? It's the funeral of the year. It cannot be canceled. But, Mum? Don't "mum" me. You'll be buried today and that's that. We can't lose face with everybody. But I don't want to die, Mum. Son, don't be selfish. You have less than one hour to die. What rotten luck. How am I supposed to do it? I don't know. I don't know Hold your breath like when you have the hiccups. Hiccups? [♪♪♪] [taking deep breaths] I can't. I can't. I'm suffocating. Darling, that's the idea. I don't like it. Think of another way. I don't like this one. Don't cry. Cooperate a little, son! If you want me to die then think of something else. Why don't you cut your veins? [♪♪♪] [groaning] How's it going, darling? I feel a little dizzy but that's about it. The funeral workers are coming in 30 minutes, they can't find him like this! Marisa, darling? Go to the kitchen, get the carving knife and stab me as many times as it takes. Me? Stab you? How can he be so macabre? [gasping] [grunting] [grunting] [taking deep breaths] [grunting] I can't take anymore. Come on. Harder. You won't die. [sobbing] Don't you feel anything? My dear my stomach hurts, but I think I'm just nervous. Damn it, Juanito. Just die! How's it going? Mum! We're running out of time. People are impatient. [taking deep breaths] This bastard doesn't want to die. I'll help. I found this in the kitchen. Mum? What are you going to do? You keep stabbing him. I'm going to whisk his stomach. [squirting] It's disgusting! Life is disgusting [squirting] death more so. [grunting] What beautiful words, Mum. [grunting] [whisk whirring] [whisk whirring] Why are you smoking? Smoking kills. It'll take hours for him to bleed out. It's not working. But the blood is perfectly fluffy. Fantastic. Look at it all. [sobbing] I didn't want to let anyone down and now it's a disaster. [sobbing] I gave my life preparing this funeral [sobbing] for nothing. [crying] Who will clean all this blood? [crying] What will we say? What will they think of us? Look! Look at our dresses and what we've done to your son. [sobbing] What do we look like? You look like what you are: Two fucking psychopaths. [slap] How dare you insult your mother. [gasps] Who does he think he is? Some manners! He's not moving. What? He's not moving or breathing. Are you sure? Yes yes. I think you killed him. I killed my son? Yes, Faustina. You killed him! You killed him! No. I can't have done. Not my son, no. But Faustina, isn't this what we wanted? [sobbing] The worst thing that can happen to a mother is to lose her child! [sobbing] But, at least we don't have to cancel the ceremony. [laughing] [screaming] I think I scared them. [mob screaming in distance] They didn't recognize me without my beard. What do we do now? [♪♪♪] Why can't I die? Why can't I die?! [screaming] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [indistinct chatter] [man 1] Dr Gonzalez, please go to surgery. [screaming in distance] [♪♪♪] [screaming] And this low pressure system, is going to slide in and bring with it. Now what? you fucking gringo. I have my green card! US Border protection: How can I help you? Well yeah. You can help me, give me my job back. What the fuck did you do? What the fuck did you do? You destroyed my car, fucking gringo! Thanks for your collaboration, and remember: Don't come back again! [gasps] [laughing] And the gringo wants to charge us for the wall. Tell him no, fucking racist gringo! We won't pay you shit! [people cheering] Wait a minute please. [crowd cheering] [♪♪♪] Mr. Trump look, we are honest people and we only want to ask you to... [screaming] [laughing] [♪♪♪] [screaming] [♪♪♪] Who changed my case? Who did you steal this from? Well, it was there [man 2] Play the guitar! Sing something, but in English, or he won't understand. [singing] [♪♪♪] Come here Mr. diplomat. It's up to you to demand him put it on! If you don't he'll step over our people and destroy our culture. [screaming] Go, hurry up! [screaming] Now, who could save us? [♪♪♪] Hey what's that? It's a miracle! It's quetzalcoatl. Is it the hail Mary? It is the hail Mary! [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] Hell yeah motherfucker! [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [applauding] [indistinct speech] Well, believe it or not we are already halfway through the show. Wasn't as bad as you thought. Well, perhaps it was but you have to defend yourself, don't you? A wise man once said that our decisions get us into trouble but our pride that keeps us there. Sometimes we make decisions to please people or annoy them. Like I did with my father I decided to study accountancy just to piss him off. My dad was a rock singer but not one of those that would sell a million records or that you would see on TV. He was the type of guy that would hop from bar to bar working for tips. He was happy a free soul. But he never gave my mother or I a dime. He said money was the root of all evil. I was 19 when I enrolled to study the thing he would hate the most: accounting. I would count money touch money smell money. And become the complete opposite of what he was: an artist. Deep down I hated my choice too but the fact that it depressed and disappointed my father was reason enough for it to be worthwhile. And that's how I ended up working in a career that I hate and now my father is dead. I hadn't accounted on that. Never do anything for anyone else for any reason whatsoever! Never! You just do you! [♪♪♪] [gulping] [♪♪♪] [munching] [♪♪♪] [sighs] [♪♪♪] [giggles] [laughing] [♪♪♪] [car honking] [indistinct speech] [gasping] [screaming] [♪♪♪] [crashing and screaming] [♪♪♪] [deep breathing] [♪♪♪] [gasping] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [laughing] [♪♪♪] [groaning] [♪♪♪] [gasps] [slaps] [♪♪♪] [exhales] [♪♪♪] [groans] [♪♪♪] [gasps] [giggles] [gasps] [gasps] [gasps] [screaming] [gasping] [♪♪♪] [giggling] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [gasps] [♪♪♪] [sobbing] [♪♪♪] [exhales] [grunting] [grunting] [♪♪♪] [growling] [grunting] [roaring] [screaming] [gasping] [♪♪♪] [screaming] [screaming] [screaming] [groaning] [♪♪♪] [sighs] [♪♪♪] [gasps] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [gasps] [chuckles] [♪♪♪] [screaming] [giggling] [laughing] [screaming] [♪♪♪] [chuckles] [chuckles] [♪♪♪] When I die, I wanna go peacefully like my grandad. Not screaming like his passengers. John says to Jack: You know since yesterday my uncle rests in peace. Jack says: Oh sorry. I didn't know your uncle died. He didn't, it was my aunt who died. [laughing] Two guys meet in heaven one says to the other: How did you go? I froze to death, said the other and you? I died of laughter Laughter? What do you mean? Well, I thought my wife was having an affair so I left for work and then returned an hour later to catch them I searched the whole house for them and when I realized my mistake I started laughing and gave myself a heart-attack! You idiot! Says the other guy. If you looked in the freezer you could have saved us both! [laughing] Get it? The lover was hiding in the freezer! The other guy was a cuckold! Just like you! Why did you say that? Because you are a cuckold I'm not a cuckold! Yes, you're holding my cock right now. No I'm not. Anyway, I don't know why I'm arguing with you. I don't know why you've got your hand up my ass. Stop it. You know nothing. You know nothing about Phillipa. She loves me. No, you're right. Of course I don't. But you remind me of this guy Dan. Dan was playing in the casino. His friend rushes in and says: Quick, Dan! Your wife is sleeping with someone else in the car park. Dan runs out comes back ten minutes later. You idiot! You scared me! It wasn't someone else. It was the same guy as always. [laughing] Cut it out. Phillipa says: Honey, can you buy me a cell phone? What about the other one? The other one will get me a tablet. [laughing] Hey Brandon. You know how Phillipa's nickname is Phil. Well when she gets a runny nose from too much sex the guys all call her Phul! [laughing] Hey! You know what else they call your wife? American Flag! Cause she even gets planted on the Moon! [laughing] [siren wailing] [taking deep breaths] [taking deep breaths] [taking deep breaths] [taking deep breaths] [♪♪♪] Mission control? Do you read me? Mission control! Do you read me? Over! [♪♪♪] Mission Control, this is SEV Omega T26. I need help! [taking deep breaths] Please answer! Mission Control this is SEV Omega T26. [astronaut] Please answer! This is SEV Omega T26. I need help! [astronaut] Mayday! [speaking in foreign language] [astronaut] Mission Control, please. Please answer someone! Please! Please, just...
