This program is rated G and is suitable for general audiences. [Christmas music playing] - Go. Yeah. - [overlapping chatter] - Simon, you want to put the eyes on the snowman? Here. Here. Get the nose, too. - [laughs] - ♪ Frosty the Snowman ♪ Was a jolly, happy soul... - Oh, look at you. You're tall enough... - Yeah! - to reach the snowman's nose. - He's gonna get his learner's permit any day now. - Stop! Stop. - He's getting older. - [all gasp] - [laughs] - Charlie Chaplin's eyes fell out of his head! You know, that happened to the real Chaplin all the time. - Dave! - It did not happen! - Prove me wrong! I'm right. - Eyes. - Eyes in. - Simon, Simon, come here. - Got it, Dad! - Hey, come here. Here. All right, you hold it really carefully. You got it? All right, I'm gonna get in. Ooh. - ♪ For when they placed it... - Hey, nice stuff. Look at that, everyone. - Hello. Hi. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - ♪ Frosty the Snowman was alive as he could be... ♪ - Ohh! Whoa, whoa, whoa! - Come on. - You really were such a cute kid. - I'm still cute. That's a fact. - But now you really do have your learner's permit. - [laughs] - [cell phone chimes] - Oh, is that, uh, Aunt Meg? - Oh, no. It's Joe. He's at the restaurant. Actually, we should probably get going, 'cause we're meeting Meg outside Umber and Sprig. Ah, it's gonna be so great to be back in Hazelwood, right? You can do that snowman contest again. It's been years since we've gone back early enough. Oh, and they have this tree-lighting ceremony - in the park. It's... - Yeah, but there won't be movies at the Madison. - No. I'll miss that, too. On the bright side, you'll get to see how many baked goods Pop and Nan basically give away for free. - Well, that is a terrible way to run a business. - Yes, but full of Christmas spirit. [diners murmuring] - [door closes] - Hey, guys. - Hello, hello. - Hey, guys. - Ah, Simon. Thought I heard you. Come try the Christmas special. - Oh, that looks good. - Turkey, stuffing, and cranberry sandwich. - Hoo! That sounds delicious. Just like Dad used to make. - Jennifer! - That's not bad. - Hi, Frank! - Your chef thought she could fool me, but I tasted the chervil in the butternut soup today. - Frank, you don't miss anything, do you? That's what we love about you. Well, that and the fact that you're here every single day. It means the world to us. - Well, feels like home. Except nobody cooks for me at home. - You know what? Nobody cooks for me at home either. - Well, then it is a good thing we have this place, isn't it? - Yeah. - Especially at the holidays. - I've put my heart into it, - that's for sure. - Hey, hey! They chose us for the Christmas party competition. - What? - That's right. Yep. DINER: They deserve it. - "Known for its commitment to community and stellar connections with its customers, Umber and Sprig is a new addition - to this year's competition." - Oh, my gosh. - So it's a competition for... - Who throws the best Christmas party, and three restaurants compete. We have been hoping to be chosen for a while now. - Yeah, yeah. - This is amazing. - Okay, so what do you win? - Well, the marketing benefit alone is worth it, but then we could win $25,000. - For the food bank. That's the charity we'd sponsor if we won. - Ohh. The food bank is so amazing, but, oh, this year, of all years. - Wait. Why are you suddenly less thrilled about this? - Because I am leaving. I'm gonna be in Hazelwood for two weeks. Are you sure you don't need me? I should cancel. - Jennifer, go see your parents. That's why you hired me, right? So you could have time to do other things. - Yeah, but, I mean, this is a big deal. - Christmas Brass! I've been waiting all year - for these tubas. - JENNIFER: Right? - I still think you're making this tuba thing up, like a "prank the new guy." - No, this is a thing that happens all over the world, and pretty soon, this is gonna be your favorite Christmas tradition, too. All right, I gotta go find my sister. I'm so excited. Oh, my gosh. - [sighs] [band playing] - All right, keep an eye out for Meg. I don't know. She was supposed to meet us a while ago. [playing "Deck the Halls"] Oh, yay. - Whoo! [overlapping chatter] - Yeah. - Hey, look. - Right. - Classic Aunt Meg. - That's Meg. [applause] What is she doing? - Okay, Dad sent these for you, red velvet cupcakes. - Ooh. - Yay, yummy. - And I got us... some fun Christmas hats. - [sputters] Wow. These are something! Here. - No. You two are enough. - Rules of the season. Someone gives you a fun Christmas hat, - you put it on your head. - You put it on. - Did they rewrite the rules? Because I swear, last time I read it, there was nothing in there about that. - Oh, come on. - Put it on. - MEG: Oh, there's our guy. - Cute. - Oh, and you know what? - What? - I got stocking stuffers, but they match the hats. - Gimme, gimme, gimme. Oh, I love it. You look amazing. - They bring out your eyes. - They bring out your nose. - So tell me about Mom. I can't get a read on the phone. - [sighs] First Christmas without... - Uncle Dave. - Yeah, she's doing that thing. - Where she says she's fine and happy... - But she's crying while she's saying it. - Yeah. Mm, I do that. - You do. - She does. - Poor Mom. - Yeah. - I mean, if I lost you, I can't even... - I don't even want to think about it. So every day, she has to walk by the theater, and it's empty. You know, there's no signs that Uncle Dave made on the marquee. There's just one big "for sale" sign. - Wait. They decided? - Yeah, they have to sell it. - [sighs] But Uncle Dave's theater is... - I know, heart of the town. Mom and Dad are really excited to see you guys for Christmas, though. - Oh, it's gonna be so fun. - Mm-hmm. - You...[laughs] - What is happening? - Okay, don't look. - Did you throw me a party? - No. No. So we're going for something new with the decorations. - I'm gonna fall over. - You gotta tell me your honest, honest impressions, okay? - Okay. I'm gonna be honest. I promise. Wh-What is this? Oh, it's beautiful. - Simple. - Right! - Spare. - Um... we weren't going for spare, so much as, um, classy, understated, modern. - It's incredible. - Right? - This is what Dad always talks about. - Build a community... - And the people will gather. - Yeah. That's what we've always done. - Look at this. - Oh, is that for me? - [laughs] It's Mom's Christmas present. - [gasps] - Come on. - Oh. - We have some work to do here. - What? [gasps] - Let's wrap them up. - Simon, you might not remember, but Uncle Dave used to put out these figurines for each of the 12 days of Christmas. - Except there are two of them missing, so the real presents are the new additions. We have some shopping to do. - Salt Lake City. - I know. - It just feels good. - It's so amazing. Hey, why don't you stick around for a few more days? You know I'm offering you the world's most unreliable inflatable bed. - [laughs] Flat by morning... - Every time! - [laughs] - [sighs] So you still going to France this year? - Yeah, without Uncle Dave. - You two loved traveling together. - I'll probably love traveling alone. - Yeah. - Just, ooh, it was so much fun hanging out with all of his Parisian friends. - Yeah. - And I loved, you know, the fact that he didn't care that he spoke terrible French. - Yeah. [laughs] - I just...I think I gotta go. - Yeah. - And I think I might even stay. [car horn honks] [overlapping chatter] [Dave laughs] Piano's made out of "Chopsticks." - [playing piano] - [laughs] [child clapping] Are Nan and Pop really selling the theater? That's always what we would do, is movies at the Madison, you know? - I know. Yeah. I'll miss it, too. - I love the way Uncle Dave used to make sound effects with this stories, like the little robot that... [whirs] - I miss calling him to ask if he'd just seen the latest movie I just watched. - Mm-hmm. He had great taste in movies. - He did, didn't he? You remember that first Christmas without your dad? How it helped so much to be around family? That's our job this year. You know, help Pop and Nan have the best Christmas they can. Make it easier, you know? Here. You need whip cream. - Okay, just give me the whole can. - Okay, take the whole thing. - Come on. Come on. - So... - Yeah? - got a big day coming up tomorrow. Do you think I could drive partway to Hazelwood? - Yes. - I guess I need to let you - drive at some point. - Yes. Here. Take some of this. - Fill it up. Oh. - [door opens] - Whoo-hoo! - It's Meg. So how'd it go? Did you find everything? - Almost. I got a little distracted by the carolers and the window displays. Part of me feels like I should just stay here, even though I'm going to Paris right after Christmas. - I don't know. - I'm gonna say it again. I think you need to go through with the trip. I mean, I love getting ready for Christmas with family, but I was just so relieved to be here. - Well, why don't you stay longer? - Really? - Yeah! Stay as long as you want. - I mean, I can't miss Christmas in Hazelwood, but I would love it. I might have to borrow some clothes. - [laughs] I love that you're even pretending to ask. You're wearing one of my sweaters. - Oh. - What are you... - That's better. Goes with the sweater. - Thanks. - All right, so I will help with the sale of the Madison and help with Mom and Dad, and you just stay and take some space. I'm glad you're here. - Oh. - I'm glad I'm here, too. [both laugh] - It's who you are now. - Okay, so you're saying that Dancer and Prancer aren't as into reindeer games as all the others? - No. I was saying that they probably spend more time practicing. - Oh, for all the dancing and the prancing. - Why would they be named that otherwise? - You make an excellent point. - I still don't see why they have to close the movie theater. - Yeah. Well, I know. Sometimes grownups have to make decisions like that. - Even though you're fixing it up. - Even then, kiddo. Come on. We still have one more errand. - Ahh. It's so hard to see it like this. Must be extra hard for my mom. - I guess let's go check inside. - [sighs] Oh, gosh. Look at it. [sighs] [camera clicks] - [gasps] Jennifer Swift. Look at you. I heard you'd be home longer than usual this year. Are you moving back? - Oh, no, no, no. We're just... We're here for Christmas. - Second home? Think it over. - Okay. Um, you remember my son Simon. Barb Hutter's the real-estate agent handling the... the sale of the theater. - Yeah. Bigger every time I see you. You probably shave now, don't you? [laughs] [sighs] - This place... - Yeah. - Nobody loved this theater like your Uncle Dave. I know it was a tough choice for your parents to let it go, but I tell you, I am determined to find the right buyer. - Well, if anyone can, Barb... - No question, it's me. And thank you. [laughs] - Ohh. - Yeah. - Oh, I've gotta get these photos up on our site. Uh, do you need keys? Here. I have extra sets - if you'll lock up. - Oh, that's great. - Thank you. - Thank you. - All right. See you around. - Okay. - [door closes] - What? - She's, uh, something. Ohh. [sighs] Look at this. Oh, this piano. - Didn't Uncle Dave know, like, three songs on this? - Yeah. - [laughs] - Hey, he used to play "Sleigh Bells," and then Megan and I would force the audiences to watch our Christmas dances, and they loved it. - [door opens] - Oh, we brought the house down. [girl laughs] - Jennifer Swift. - Eric! - Yeah. It's been a long time. - Yeah, it's been, what, years? - Yeah, think so. - Uh, this is my son Simon. - Hey. - Nice to meet you. - Yeah, you, too. You know, your mom was my old high school debate nemesis. - You know, that's funny, because she's my current debate nemesis. - Hey, I like to win an argument. - And I know better than to argue with that. - And this... - [chuckles] - this is Madzie. This is my daughter. - Hi, Madzie. I'm Jennifer, - and this is Simon. - Hi. - Hi. - I'm gonna go check it out. - Where are you going? - I was just thinking that I would go check out the projection booth. - Can I come? - Sure. Let's go on an adventure. Come on. - So my parents said that you are working on some repairs around here. I never saw you as a contractor type. - Well, I am indeed full of surprises. - Yeah, you are. And you're a city councilman. - Yeah. See? Surprise. - Yeah. - Ah, Madzie and I moved back here a few years ago, and now I'm the head of the Hazelwood Historic Preservation Board. - That's a mouthful. - [laughs] It is. I mean, but seriously, what has more history than the Madison theater, right? - Yeah. [plays notes] Dave and I were working out plans to bolster the integrity of the place when... - Right. - Yeah. - And how much integrity does the place need? - Uh, you know what? It's in pretty decent shape - actually. - Really? - I just...Yeah, it's... - [laughs] See? - Oops. - Just needs a little love. I just want to make sure whoever buys it keeps all these details. I mean, you don't see a lot of old movie theaters like this anymore. - Yeah, exactly. I mean, I can't imagine somebody getting rid of this piano or these seats or these gorgeous curtains. Do you know that my great-grandmother made these curtains? - Seriously? - Yes. - See, exactly. What is Christmas without movies at the Madison, right? So my thought is we'll just try to repair as much as we can, and hopefully the new buyer will want to keep things that way. - You know, I remember you being a lot more difficult. - Honestly? Same. - Hmm. - Hmm. So I hear you're a big deal in the restaurant world now. - Oh, who said that? - Meg. We're in the same dodgeball league. - Yeah, well, we do. We have a restaurant, and we serve fairly decent food. - Do you? - Yeah. - I'm not surprised. - Dad! Simon knows a lot about how projectors works. - Is that right? - What can I say? Old movies are the best movies. - They are. So listen. We just came to drop a few things off, but I have a meeting with a possible buyer at your parents' cafe, actually. - Well, nothing says high-powered, cutthroat business deal like muffins and cocoa. - All the best business deals start with baked goods. - [laughs] Yes, they do. - Also they...they keep an eye on Madzie for me. - Well, we were just heading over there. Who's in the mood for hot chocolate? - All right. - Let's do it. - Thanks. MAN: Are you doing the peppermint mocha this year? - Oh, my gosh, yeah. [entry bell rings] - Hello, hello. - Hey, there they are. - [laughs] - Hi. - Hi, Pop. - Hi. - Oh, come here and hug your mother. Oh, honey, hi. [gasps] Oh, my gosh! Honey! I barely know you. - You saw me at Thanksgiving. - I see what I see, kid. You are growing up. - Merry Christmas, Pop. - You know, you do look more like your dad each and every day. - So, Madzie, hey, the usual? - Yes, ma'am. - Oh. Wow. Simon, Madzie is working on an entire town's full of gingerbread houses. - Oh! - Just like your mom - and Aunt Meg used to do. - We did. - Want to help? - Yeah, of course. - Okay, so you put a little candy... - With the snowman contest and the Christmas tree lighting, I don't know, this year just got so much busier. I'm not sure how. - We went by the theater today. How you holding up? - Well, honey, if I had known last Christmas was the last with your Uncle Dave, I'd have, you know...I'd have... Um, but I'm fine. Just takes time. - Yeah. - Okay? Selling the theater is the right thing to do. I just wish we had one more Christmas. [laughs] You know... - Yeah. - [chuckles] - Get to work. - All right. - Let's make sure we've got plenty. - Stars? - Yeah. Oh, boy. You guys have really made some progress. - I think Simon's eating more than he's contributing. - I'll bet. Hey, Barb. How'd it go? - That was Steve Crosby from StarMark Cinemas. - Wait. StarMark, the chain of theaters? - Yes, but I told him he's gonna have to adhere... - It can't be a chain. They're gonna take out all of... - No, no, no. Hold on. He did say he would look into preserving the theater. - Yeah, and I'll make sure the town council stays on top of him. He's got to honor... - They're not gonna honor that. - Let's just wait until we have more information. - My favorite part of Christmas used to be the Christmas cartoons at the Madison. - My Uncle Dave used to let me pick out those cartoons. - Eric... how hard would it be to do one more movie night? - Uh, what do you mean? - Well, you know, like, Christmas at the Madison? Like just one more movie night, just for the family? Like, how hard would that be? - Well, I mean, there's still a lot of repairs to do. - Yeah. - I don't know if you'd be able to get everything done in time. - Okay, but...but... theoretically it would be possible to have one more Christmas movie night? Ohh. Let's get you open one last time. [sighs] Oh. - That was...Oh, it's so funny. [laughs] Would you wear that hat? I love that. Oh, look. Look. - Ohh. - Morning. - Oh, good morning. - Hi. - Mwah! - Ohh. - Oh, no. This picture of you in the Christmas pageant. - Oh, yeah. That hair. You better be careful. Awkward teen years run in our family. - Ohh. Hey, you want some coffee? - Yes, I'd love some, thanks. - Wait. This is Eric from yesterday. - Yeah, mm-hmm. - Why are you guys dressed like that? - Like we're running for office? Debate tournaments. - They were on the same team. You never would have known it. So much bickering. - They would have been unstoppable if they worked together. - Thank you. Here. - What... - Ooh. - It's 12 days before Christmas, and Meg said it'd be okay. - Okay. [laughs] Oh, my. Okay. [sighs] It's Dave's Christmas village. - Yeah, it's a little Scones and Sweets. - Ohh! - I know Dave liked to put 'em out one at a time leading up to Christmas. - [inhales] It's perfect. Thank you. - You're welcome. - [sighs] Ohh. Right there. [laughs] - So what have you two got planned for the rest of the day? Uh, tonight is the big snowman contest. - Well, actually we were planning on having one more... - Scone. Scone. We were gonna have... - Here. Let's split it. - What? You were going to... - Mmm! Oh, that's so good. [mouth full] Oh, yeah! Mmm! Ohh! Mmm! We should get dressed. Thanks for the coffee. Ahem! I just don't want to get Pop and Nan's hopes up. I don't know if it's gonna be possible. I mean, it's been closed for, what, six months? - Yeah. So keep it a surprise. - Yeah. Yeah, just until we can take a closer look. Thanks. - Okay. Look, this one is my favorite one of them all. - So seats are in good shape. We've already painted. But the boiler's from the 1920s. It was gonna need replacing anyway, so for now, the heat is... - imaginary. - [laughs] - Popcorn machine needs fixing. - And the projector's a dinosaur, so... - Great! We can work with that. - We can work with this. Come on, kiddo. So there should be a series of switches. - Okay, so we got the lights, the film, and the lens. - Found the Christmas ornaments. - [laughter] - Yes, you did. - Hmm. - Oh. Oh! - Hey! - It works. - Madz, come here. - [gasps] Oh. [electricity flickers] - [sighs] - Aw, no. The fuse blew. - All right, let's see what we can do. - Shoot. We can...Oh, I'm sorry. - Pardon me. Whoop! - Sorry. - [laughs] My bad. Sorry. - Ooh. Pardon me. - Ohh! My bad. - Oh, th...right there. - Oh, yeah. Great, great. - [gasps] You fixed it! - Yeah. Listen, I have to be honest. If your family wants to sell the theater, having a movie night might... I don't know, might make buyers think you're not serious about selling. And then if Barb needs to show the space and your family's around... - Barb is not gonna have to show the space while we're there for one night with the family. If she does, we're just gonna clear out. I really think we can get this working. It's just one night of Christmas movies. - I-I get why it would be great. It's just I... - And I can help. I can fix things. - Yeah, but can you fix a projector? - I can find someone who fixes a projector. What about Valerie Sanders? Didn't she used to run it? - Yeah, she teaches at the high school now. - But you can't just... - That's perfect! - I was in Girl Scouts with her. - Oh. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, and she likes every single one of the photos I post online. She's totally gonna be onboard. - Yeah, totally. - Eric, I really think, with your help, we could do this. - [sighs] - Right? - Nobody wins a debate against Jennifer Swift. - You're right. He's right. - Whoops. - All right. I'll see you - back at Nan and Pop's. - Okay. [cell phone chimes] Meg? - I want to help your staff throw a blowout party. I want to win the food bank that money so badly. So I was thinking, what if I didn't go back to Hazelwood for Christmas? What if I stayed here for a couple of days and... - I think that's really smart. - You do? - Yeah. And Simon is...I don't know. It's like he's opening up or something. Oh, and I have this idea. I want to do one last night of Christmas movies at the Madison, but I don't know. It's scary. - Oh, Jen, I think that's really smart. - You do? Eric thinks it might scare off potential buyers, - but I'm not sure. I... - Oh. City Councilman Eric Baker. Your high school debate crush, Eric Baker. - Shh! Meg. - Oh, what? Can he hear me over the phone? - Stop. It wasn't a crush. - It was... - Oh, please. I was there. I love this. But wait. You don't think Mom and Dad are gonna be upset if I don't come home for a couple of days? - I think they'd be glad you're trying something new. - Oh, sister swap. I love this. - I do, too. All right. Well, um... I love you. Call me if anything comes up, okay? - I promise I will. I love you, too. - Bye. She's never giving back my coat. [overlapping chatter] - Here. - Oh. Ah, yeah. POP: Hey, hand me that. - Looks good. [sighs] That is something. - Ohh. Can't imagine what it's gonna be like when Madzie's that age. - What they want most is for you to leave 'em alone. - It's that easy? - Oh, no, no. It's torture. You worry all the time, and they never tell you anything, and it's not for the faint of heart. - Tell you what, though. Simon's been really kind to Madzie. You don't see a lot of teenage boys with that much patience or heart. - [sighs] - All right, come on, guys. Put your stick in the sleeve. Okay, we'll try that. Like that. [lights clunk] - Whoa ho! - [applause] Looks like your mom found the switch to the marquee. JENNIFER: Ohh. Oh, it looks great. - Oh, it looks so wonderful with the lights on. - [laughs] Okay, don't cry. Don't cry. I have some good news. - What? - Simon and I talked to Eric, and we think that, before we sell, we can do one more, for the family, Christmas at the Madison. - These are her happy tears. - [laughs] - Well, look at this. - Hi! - Are you reopening the Madison? - Valerie, I was actually gonna call you to come and look at our projector, but yeah. Yeah, I think we're gonna do one more movie night. - Dave would love this. - Yeah, he would. - Christmas at the Madison. - Yeah. - We should invite Rita and Joyce to come with us. - No, no, no, that... - Rita! Joyce! - It was just for the family. That's what she was trying... - No, it's... - No, everybody, we were just saying that it's only... - Let's tell everybody. - No, guys, it's not... - Well, no, don't... - No, it's... - We're not even sure it's gonna work. - I... - Yes! - So it looks like you may have just invited the whole town. [woman laughs] - Yeah, that got away from me. t] JENNIFER: Well, it was supposed to be just for the family, but now that the whole town is so excited to come, I guess I gotta throw a bigger event. - If anyone can, it's you. - Ohh. - [sighs] You've been through so much, and you kept going. - Oh, I just hope things at the restaurant aren't too much for Meg to handle. - [laughs] If I needed to throw a party, your sister is the one I would call. She's been running our place forever. I'm sure you don't need to worry. - Well, I need to worry a little bit. It's a big deal for Umber and Sprig. - You and your sister take good care of each other. - Yeah. - Your mom and Dave did that, too. - Yeah. - You know, we're really happy you could make it in earlier this year. Made a difference. - For me, too. - Oh, wow. Hi. [laughs] Hi. - Eric and Madzie. Hi, guys. - Is Simon here? - Hey, let's go find him together. [Jennifer chuckles] - Here we go. - [sighs] - Simon's fitting right in. - Yeah. [overlapping chatter] - Even if I'm starting to feel a little in over my head. - How come? - Well, now that the whole town is expecting a movie, I guess I gotta figure out how to get that boiler working. - And the electric. - Oh, gosh. - I don't know why that's been acting funny lately. - All right, worst case, there's no projector, no heat. I know about five dance numbers that Meg and I used to do. I can teach you. - Okay, no. Look, I'm being serious. I don't know how Steve Crosby or any other buyer's gonna take this. - It's because we have to let go of it that I want to do this. My mom needs it, and really it's something that Uncle Dave would love. - Well, look, I'm just here to make sure it's preserved, so it might not be my place to even have an opinion, but I'm just...I'm not convinced that throwing a big live event is really the right thing to be focused on right now. - I think... - NAN: Eric! Hey, Jennifer, come here. - [laughter] NAN: Hey, guys. - [laughs] - Listen. Since Meg is staying longer in the city, would you and Madzie like to join us and help us decorate our tree tonight? - Oh, yeah. - No, we don't want to intrude. - Come on. - I made so many cookies, you'd be doing us a favor. - Yeah. The more, the merrier. - Hey, Madz, what do you say to some cookies? - Yeah! - All right. - You okay up there? Don't slip or anything. - Well, I mean, you're the one holding the ladder. Wait. Are you holding the ladder? - Yeah. Wait! What's happening?! - Are you okay?! - [laughs] - You're hilarious. So you having fun? - Um, yeah. - It's different from the city. - Yeah. But, I mean, it's not different in a bad way. I got to see the tubas with Aunt Meg, and, uh, now we get to go spend some time with Nan and Pop, so it's the best of everything. - Yeah. All right. Ah, the marquee is up. Valerie's gonna come look at the projector, and, uh... - I mean, it's still a little cold in there, so... - Right. Yeah, Eric and I are gonna see what we can do about that. Come on. Come on. Come on. [sighs] Whoo! [panting] [powers down] - Ah. So how's that coming? - Oh. Heh. Good. Then bad. - Then good. Then bad again. - Huh. - And there's a dark corner over there and over there. This basement is really big. - Yeah. Yeah, it really is. - [grunts] - Yeah, whoever buys this place is probably gonna, eh, replace these lights and...and replace this beast with central heat. - Well, until then, I am just going to try my hardest. - Okay. - You know, when my, uh, husband died, I took over everything at the restaurant, so that meant all the repairs, everything, so that's my rule now, is that I have to try it first. [chuckles] It's... You offering? - I'm offering, 'cause my rule is to, uh, make myself useful. - That is a...It's a good rule. - Try to help out where I can. - Yeah, thank you. - [grunts] Madzie's really excited to be helpful. - Hmm. - Yeah. - You know, I try to protect my time for her. - You know? - Yeah. - Be available for what's important. - Ah, it's always the challenge, isn't it? - Yeah. [grunts] - Come on. Help me out with this, will you? - Oh, yeah, sure. - Just give it a push. - Go ahead. [grunts] - Okay, ready? - [hissing] - Ohh! [both laugh] - Hey, did we just fix something together? - I think we did. - Hah! - Wow. I gotta go. - Um... Um, I told my mom that I would...Oops. I slipped. She was... - um, my mom. - Yeah, I...Yeah, you... - Okay. - Your mom. - Thanks. - Yeah. - So I know it wasn't an easy decision to sell the Madison, but did you ever consider keeping it? - Oh, of course, but we would never have been able to run a movie theater and a bakery. - Hmm. - And then Meg said she wasn't interested. And besides... - Meg needs to spread her wings. - Exactly. - And you, well, gosh, we never thought - of asking you about... - Oh, no, no, no. I-I mean, in another life, maybe. It'd be a dream. Simon and I would love it, but, no, our lives are full. Very full. - Anyway, the money was... - Overwhelming. Upgrading those projectors? - Uh, the heating. - All of it. - Yeah. And so Barb says that she's got some great new photos, and so hopefully we'll have a buyer soon. - A buyer that's not a chain. - Mm. [cell phone chimes] [chimes] - [chimes] - You guys, it's Meg! - Hey. - Hi! - Hi, everybody. I missed you. Are you decorating the tree? - We are. - Yes. - [chuckles] How are you? - Um... - Wait right there. I'll be right back. What's wrong? Are you okay? - Did you know that Joe doesn't know what mistletoe is? - Did you know that Mom and Dad put peppermint Schnapps in their hot cocoa all season long? - Did you not know? - All right, focus. What's the matter? - No, it's fine, really. Everything, it's all going so great, and you have nothing to worry about here. Um, but I-I don't think I'm gonna make it to the Madison tomorrow night. - Is there a problem? Do you need me? - No. No. I-I'm really enjoying myself here. I think it's probably the first time I've felt my grief lift in a while. - Ohh. I wish I could hug you. Oh, of course. Stay there. - Thank you. Thanks for understanding. - Yeah. - Is everything going okay there? - Sort of. Um, I somehow... managed to invite the entire town to Christmas at the Madison tomorrow night. But, I mean, it's gonna be fine, right? Um, it's fine. - Wow. No, that doesn't sound fine. That sounds like magic. Oh, good luck. Give everyone there a really big kiss for me. - Ohh! Gosh! - Oh! - Sorry. Are you okay? - That was Meg. It's just Meg. She's so great... to have a sister like her. - Yeah? - Come in. Come in. - [laughs] - Yeah. - Nice to see you. ["O Christmas Tree" playing] - ♪ O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree ♪ ♪ Thy leaves are so unchanging ♪ O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree ♪ ♪ Thy candles shine... JENNIFER: Every year, we decorate the tree, and then we stand back, and we look at it, and we try to figure out what's missing. - And then a few days later, we all gather again, and we exchange ornaments. And sometimes we make them, and sometimes we buy them, but they remind us of the year that has passed. - So what's missing? - Something homemade. - Yes. - I agree. - Ohh! - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! - You okay? - I am so sorry. I didn't see you there at all. - It's all right. There's water damage under here. - Was it frozen? Because I'm frozen. We should have done a better job with that heater. - Yeah, we should have. - You could put it on the marquee. - Just big "Bring coats." - Maybe. - It's cold, very cold. But it's nice. It's nice. Oh, it's so nice to see it all lit up like this. - Yeah, we are really excited about showing a movie here tonight. - It's all anyone's talking about in town. - And you're sure we're not in the way of any buyers? - That's what I came to talk to you about. It's not so much that there are buyers, plural. It's just maybe the one buyer, singular. - And that is... - Well, I've been talking to Steve Crosby from StarMark Cinemas, and I really think he's gonna be your best offer. And by best offer... I mean your only offer. - That's a chain. - Well, Steve did say he'd work with the town to preserve as much of the historic elements as he could. - I'll talk to your parents about it, but I really think it's the best that you're gonna do. - All right. Thank you, Barb. - All right. Bye. - Bye, Barb. - Toodles. [sighs] Okay. Well, whatever's gonna happen is gonna happen. - Let's just put on the best show we can tonight. - Yes. We're gonna make it a night for Hazelwood to remember. - This trip to California is your mother's real present, but, uh, I need to find something to wrap. Heh. She has wanted to tour those Hollywood landmarks for years. - Aw, who doesn't? - [chuckles] - Well, she's gonna love the trip, but what are we looking for exactly? - Well, we'll... we'll know it when we see it. - Okay. - Now, you've been spending some time with an old flame... - Oh, no, no, no. Dad, Dad, Eric and I have only ever been just friends. We live in different worlds, different responsibilities, jobs, kids. It's just way too complicated. - If it wasn't complicated, it wouldn't be interesting. - [gasps] Look what I found. - Ah, there it is. [both laugh] - Just stay open to it. The Madison is famously romantic. Your mom and I had our first date there. - Dad, you're gonna have to let this one go. - You and Charlie were very devoted to each other. But there's nothing wrong with wanting another chance at love. - Hey, Pop. Look at the bow tie that I found. - Do they light up? - They do. - It's its best feature. - Well, we would be fools not to wear them to the Madison tonight. Go grab a few. - All right. - Come on. Let's wrap this up. We sure about the bow tie? - Rules of the season. It's ridiculous and perfect. - Okay. I guess we're ready. - [sighs] Yeah. Are you nervous? - Oh, I'm so nervous. I just...I want it to be special, you know, for Nan and Pop and the town and you. I want it to have all of the Christmas glory that it had when Uncle Dave was there, you know? - Oh, come on. They're gonna love it. And if they don't, we'll love it. This has been fun. - It has, hasn't it? [chuckles] Oh. - Mwah! - [camera clicks] - Oh, my... - Hah! Gotcha. Whew! Let's do it. Come on. - Hey. - Hi. You look incredible. - Excuse me. - Thanks. - Yeah? - Jennifer, right? - Yes. - I'm sorry. Uh, Jen, this is Steve Crosby, the executive from StarMark I was telling you about. - Steve Crosby. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Well, please, go find some seats, and then maybe we can talk after the movie? - I would love that. - Great. - Ahh. Oh, one last thing. - Oh, please tell me it's good news. - It is in fact good news. I talked to some of the volunteers at the senior center, and they got a bunch of extra blankets for us. - Oh, that's great! It's gonna be so cozy with... the extra blankets. That's awesome. Thank you, Eric. - You're welcome. [patrons chatting] - [applause and cheering] - There she is. - Excuse me. - What is it? - Is that right? [amplified] Ah. Can you hear me? - Yes! - Yep! - Thank you all so much for coming. - [applause] - First of all, I want to apologize. We're so sorry about the lack of heat. But you know what? It's a winter movie, so it adds realism, right? - [laughter] - It is so wonderful to see these seats full. Can I ask how many of you went on your first date here at the Madison? - Whoo! - Whoo! - And is there anyone here tonight that's on their first date right now? You are. All right. [applause] Good luck. [laughs] Uncle Dave loved that so many people had their first dates right here. And it means the world to me and my family that you've come here for one last Christmas with us. And now, without further ado, I would like to invite you to enjoy this classic film that was actually the only one we could get to run through the projector, so... - [laughter] - Thank you. - Yeah, Jennifer! - [cheering] JENNIFER: I love you. [projector whirring] [classic movie music playing] - [whispering] Nice job. NARRATOR: When the reindeer got back to the sleigh, they were surprised by what they found. There was a young girl sitting in the middle of a giant pile of candy canes. She couldn't have been more than five years old, but she was cute as a button. - Oh! Oh, my gosh! Oh! Oh! Get out! [screams] - What happened? - Your popcorn machine caught fire. Wow. That was a lot. - [electricity crackles] - [film slows] [patrons groan] - Folks, I'm sorry. Uh, sorry. It's really a mess up here. The power's out. And, um, the film snapped. And I don't think I'm gonna get this working again. - Not tonight, anyway. - [grumbling] - Everybody just turn on your flashlights. - It's so dark in here. - You okay? - Yeah. I guess I just wanted this to work out more than I thought I did. - Yeah. - Jennifer, disappointing evening. - Well, I suppose so, but... - Ah, yeah. Don't worry about it. StarMark Cinema will overhaul the projection system, and we'll replace the popcorn machine. - Thank you, Steve. - Not a problem. We'll hash all this out before the new year. StarMark is eager to start renovations. - We'll be in touch. Steve. - I'm sorry, guys. - [sirens blaring] - The movie didn't work. I'm pretty sure half the townsfolk are still frozen in their seats, and... [firetruck horn honks] and the fire department is arriving. [horn honks] - Honey, we all need to let this place go. Okay? [brakes hiss] Come on, babe. - Yeah. - All right, gentlemen... - [firefighters chatting] - [doors close] - [sighs] I don't want to let it go. - I know. - I think that I was so excited for everybody else, that I didn't realize how much I wanted one more Christmas at the Madison. Last night was... not what I was hoping for. - Honey, it's the thought that counts. - Whatever happens with the theater will happen. For now, let's...let's just enjoy our Christmas together, hmm? - [cell phone buzzing] - Oh. Would you excuse me? - That's Umber and Sprig. - Mm-hmm. - Victoria? Hi. What? [phone line rings] MEG: Jennifer! Hi! - Meg? - So, um... how was the Madison? - It was 10 degrees inside. And the projector broke. Also there was a small fire. And then I got a call from Victoria, my now former head chef, who I'm happy for, - but also what... - Oh, yes. Yes, Vic... I was supposed to call you. - You should have called, Meg. - And I didn't. I didn't call you, because... Joe wouldn't let me. - What? Are you kidding? - [laughs] I'm kidding. I'm totally kidding. Of course I'm kidding. He actually wanted to call you, and I wouldn't let him because of, um, the Madison. - All right, let's just talk about this when I get back. For now, just tell everybody that... - You're coming back here? - Well, yeah. I have to help find a head chef, and I have to check on the Christmas party and make sure the staff is okay with everything that's changing right now. - Oh, no, you know what? Joe has a lead on a chef, and the lead is, uh... uh, Jesse Collins. - The grilled cheese guy? - Yes, with the Michelin asterisks. Number signs. I mean stars. [laughs] They're little stars. Anyway, he's the best. So we're gonna, you know, see what happens. We got this. So tell me, um, more about the Madison. - Well...[sighs] The popcorn machine caught fire, and then the projector went out after five minutes and killed the electric. - Oh, no. That sounds... - terrible. - Terrible, yes. - And a little bit funny? - Look, you know what? Even so, I loved it. [laughs] And Simon loved it. But the only buyer that Mom and Dad can find is StarMark Cinemas. It's gonna be so hard to let that theater go. - Oh, well, maybe you should stay there a little bit longer, you know, while you can. 'Cause we've totally got this handled here, like 100%. - Okay, but the second anything else goes wrong, you have got to call me. - Of course. Obviously. [laughs] I love you. - I love you, too. [snorts] Bye. - You're doing a good thing, Jennifer, giving Meg a chance to be away, heal a little. - Mm, thank you. - And I wasn't eavesdropping. - [chuckles] - But also you weren't whispering. - True. [sighs] - Maybe she's giving you the same chance, helping you be here. Maybe this time can be... healing for you, too, if you let it. - Yeah. - Hey. - Hey. What, are you just, uh, walking through town with a ladder? - Your mom asked if I'd swing by and help hang some garland, replace some bulbs. - Oh. - You know, if I could, I'd freeze Hazelwood in time just like it is right now. - I would, too. Except you know what I'd do? I would build a kitchen in that gigantic basement, you know, so you could see a movie and have dinner, maybe even a glass of wine. - Ah, town's never had anything like that before. - No, it'd be everything that I love about the Madison and the restaurant, and I'd be home, closer to Mom and Dad. - So you still think of Hazelwood as home? - Yeah, I guess I do, even after all these years in Salt Lake. - Well, you know, you, uh, might need some help getting the permits through town council. - I know a guy. - No. I already have a business to run, and my head chef is leaving. Opening a kitchen in a movie theater on top of the theater upgrades, that's... - That's an ambitious plan. Be hard to do it alone. - Yeah. And besides, Simon and I have a whole life we have to get back to soon. - Yeah. It's too bad. This has been really fun. Listen, would you and Simon like to come over tonight? Madzie and I got these ornament kits, - and we'd love it... - We'd love to. I mean, it's hard to say no to Madzie. - No. Good. - Thanks for helping. - Sure. I'll see you later. - Okay. - [chuckles] - Hey. How's it going in here? - Well, um, I swept up the burned popcorn. Somebody came by to pick up the blankets, and, uh, oh, a nice old man stopped by and had a lot to say about the boilers and gaskets. - [laughs] Hazelwood loves to help. - Everybody came to help last night, and they'd all come again tonight if you wanted them to. - You're right about that. Clearly they want one last Christmas here. - Clearly. [laughs] [camera clicks] - Good? Whew. So we're agreed? We're gonna open one last time. - Yeah. Our Christmas present to the town. Heh.

I used to come here all the time. - Yeah? I still do. - Really? - Yeah. It's a great place to sit - and just think things through. - Yeah. - It's where I decided to run for city council. - Really? - Yeah. It's where I compose all my best arguments for preserving the history of the buildings downtown. You know, I would absolutely take Madzie to a movie-theater restaurant. - Hmm. Even without crunching the numbers, I know it's not really prac... - What's this? - I got some design skills. - Oh. You sketched my Madison kitchen? - Yeah, well, you said the basement would work, and it occurred to me it's a really good idea. - Yeah, except for the part where I fire up a second business and get so busy I never see my kid. - Mm, there's that. - But... [cell phone buzzing] - Oh. Simon. - On cue. - Simon? - [indistinct] - Yeah? - What? Wait. Wait. Wait. Slow down. I can't... Yeah. Of course. Like, yeah, I'll be right there. - Bye. - Um...[laughs] Can you drop me off at the theater? - Yeah, of course. Everything okay? - Yeah, he said it's... everything's fine, nothing to be worried about, but I have to to see it to believe it. So I'll see you and Madzie later? My mom wanted to invite you guys to the ornament exchange. - Yeah. Sounds great. Wouldn't miss it. I have a few things I have to go over with your parents about the theater sale anyway. - Right. Okay. Hey, um, thank you for today. That was fun. - It was fun. - I'll see you tonight. - Okay. - Guess what. - What is going on? So you know how Nan and Pop, they told me to check the door frame for the keys, right? So I checked. I found the keys. And then when I opened the door. - Whoa. - Yeah. - It's top of the line. Ah, I'd been telling your Uncle Dave for years to get a new projector for this place, and he did. - All right, so if we're gonna get the whole town back in here for a movie, how hard is it gonna be to set all this... - I won't know until I get in there. But do you know how long I've wanted to play with one of these things? If you'd let me, I... - I mean, I'd help. I really wanna help. - The theater kids geek out over stuff like this. We'd have helpers. - Well, I think we have to try, right? - ...but you're going to be giving this. - Oh, Jennifer, hi. - Hi. - We're just about to drop off the contracts - for your parents to look over. - Okay. Thanks. - Looks like you're giving movie night another try. - Yeah. Well, we can't promise heat, but we just couldn't let it go. - Well, you're just in time, too, 'cause they're pushing to close the sale by the end of the year. - Okay. - Now listen. I know you had your hopes pinned on preserving the place, but usually when they buy an old theater like this, they do a complete renovation. They wouldn't put preservation in the contract. I'm sorry. I-I really did try. - I appreciate that, Steve. Thank you. Well, I hope you'll both still join us for movie night. - We wouldn't miss it for the world, right? - I'll be there. - Bye. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - [sighs] - Listen up. True to family custom, this is how it works, okay? You display your ornament, and then you tell us what significance it has, and then you choose someone to put it on the tree for you. - All right. I'll go first. - Okay. - Yeah. - [laughs] Ah. Uh, my big brother Dave wore this watch for years. And since this is my first Christmas without him, I wanted to mark the time. [laughs] And so I had it made into an ornament. - Hmm. - Um... Simon. Would you do the honors? - Of course. - [laughs] POP: All right. Good job. - Now it's my turn. - Okay. - My darling... now that we have decided to take the trip to California... - Yay. - [laughs] - I got you this. - Oh, honey. - [laughs] - [laughs] - You do it. - Really? - Yes. - Oh, I'm so excited. I'm gonna... Well, I think right there. - Hey, you okay? [Nan laughs] - Sometimes Christmas is sad. Your grandma misses her brother. I miss my mom. Yeah, I miss my dad, too, more at Christmastime. You know, he used to have the loudest laugh in every room. - I just know she'd really like this. - You know what? I really miss my dad. It helps me to just imagine that he's right here with me. - I do that, too. - I think we all do. - Because I enjoy making myself useful, I have a toolkit. - [whoops] - [laughs] - Seemed appropriate. And, Jen, since you're the one I like to be useful for, would you hang that, please? - Sure. I'd love to. Okay, gotta find the right spot. - Let's see. [chuckles] - Here we go. - Yeah. - It's perfect. - All right. Yeah. - So that's it? - Another couple adjustments, but then yeah. Pretty much. - [laughter] - Well, it's... DAVE: Oh, this is fantastic. - [piano playing] - Unbelievable. - What? DAVE: Come on. You guys are amazing. You move so well together. [piano playing on film] DAVE: See? I told you. That's what I'm talking about. Yes. Yes. Yeah, timing. - I mean, it looks focused to me. VALERIE: Is it bright enough to... Oh, hello down there. What do you think? - What is this? - Uncle Dave got these old family movies digitized, so I found 'em on an old hard drive. - [squeals] - Whoa! - [laughs] - The joke about the chopsticks? That's a good one, isn't it? - Come on back, kids. Those two will let us know if it goes sideways. - Hey, hey, look. Here's, uh... - Oh. - One of our...one of our quilts. - There we go. - That's good. - DAVE: Oh, you got me. - ERIC: Better? - Oh, I'm so excited to get everybody back in here. - Yeah. I had my first kiss right over there. - Did you, really? - Yeah. During a showing of, uh, Scrooged. - [laughs] Who was it? - I'll tell if you will. - Oh, please. I never kissed anyone here. My Uncle Dave was always upstairs. - Right. - I didn't. - Oh, whatever you say. - I'm actually kind of jealous. - Eh, don't be. It was very awkward. - [chuckles] - Plus I had a crush on another girl. - Who? - Y-You really...You didn't know? - That was... - Wow. - So it was my first kiss at the Madison. [chuckles] - I'm glad. - Daddy! - Hey. Uh, Madzie, you're... - Hi. - Uh... hey, kiddo. - Uh, I'm gonna go check the projector. - Yeah. Eh... hey, come here. [chuckles] - You know, it's too bad you don't live here. We could use more boys in the theater program. - Yeah. Nah, I wish. I really like it here. But I guess we're going back after Christmas. - What are all these boxes? - Dave's things, photos from the entire history of this place and projects he would start and then leave on that shelf until he had time to work on them. - Hey, everybody. Looks like you're all set. - Projectorwise, anyway. - Are you serious? - Yeah. - [sighs] - You okay over here? - Yeah. Just working on a little figuring. - Darling, we've got to get over to Hazelwood Park. Did you remember to pack the... - My darling, I have everything on the list and then some. - As per usual. Kiss for luck? Ohh. [laughs] - You two... - We keep each other going. Naughty or nice list? - No. Mm, pros and cons. - Ah. Anything in particular? - Future in general. Maybe the Madison can be a part of it? - [sighs] Too? - I don't know.

We can talk in the car. - Actually I was thinking I was gonna stay here. - Oh. - I mean, we need somebody to be here to make sure that we're ready for the movie. - [sighs] Look, Simon, I understand, - but I really think that we... - No. Look, Mom, I get that you're trying to figure out what's next for us. And, I mean, if we have to go back to Salt Lake and this is all just a really good dream, that's fine. I just... I really want to do this movie tomorrow. - Okay. All right, well, I'll just... I'll turn around, and I'll come right back as soon as I get everything in order. I love you. - I love you, too. JENNIFER: Thank you. - You're welcome. - [sighs] This place really does look amazing. - Your sister, she's a force of nature. - Isn't she? [sighs] This whole drive back, I just kept thinking of all the things I left for somebody else to do. - Well, Joe and Meg are a great team. - Yeah. - And wait 'til you see the plans for the party. Think you'll be impressed with how we all pulled together. - Thank you. - [door opens] - Jen! Jen! We have a solution! - You found a chef? - We found a lead on a chef. - Get your coat. - Hey, all. - Hi. - Wait. You're... You're Jennifer Swift. - Y-Yeah. [laughs] - Wow. Okay. Uh, your article last year in Great Salt about hospitality and community building, - like, that... - Yeah? - that is always what I've believed restaurants could be. - Wow. Well, thank you. Thank you so much. - That's... - Of course. - Um, we'll each have one of everything, please. - Amazing. Um, you know what? I'm gonna get you guys my last three red velvet doughnuts. - Mmm. - And you're in luck, because they usually sell out. - Wow. I like your confidence. Those look amazing. Well, we'll have to see, though, because our dad makes a mean red velvet... - Well, anything. - Anything. Yeah. - [laughs] One sec. - Oh, wow! - Mm-hmm. - You know, I would go here every day. - It's good. - Yeah. - Joe, what do you think? Does this wow you? - I just worry, because he works at a food stand. You know, it's different kind of volume. - Mm-hmm. - But... it is very good. - Mm-hmm. - You know what? We need someone immediately. I say let's do it. Let's make him an offer. - Yeah? - [laughs] - This is a really good space. - It is. - [sighs] - [both laugh] - Yeah, I come here every year - when the holidays get nutty. - Mm-hmm. - Simon loves it, too, but he won't admit it. This year, all he's into is the Madison. - So they're really gonna turn it into a multiplex? - Well, the only way to preserve the history is to keep it in the family. - Hmm. - Simon wants us to move there and run it. - Is that what you want, too? - I don't see how we could possibly do that. I don't have the kind of money that it would take. - Well, why don't I take the money that I was gonna use - to go to France and give it... - No. Nope. No way. You save that money for your next step. - Whatever that is. [blows lips] Well... if this is the last Christmas at the Madison, I want to spend every single minute celebrating it. - You're gonna be there? - Of course I'm gonna be there. I wouldn't miss it. I will even be on time. - Oh, you won't, but I appreciate the offer. - [laughs] [entry bell chimes] - Hey. - Hi, hi, hi. - You're back. - I am. Turns out Meg had a solution I never even would have thought of on my own. - Ah, well, we know that feeling. We're gonna miss her when she goes off to France. - Yeah. - Sure won't be the same - around here. - Listen, Jennifer. Steve delivered the paperwork for the Madison today. We're supposed to close the sale before New Year's. - Oh. But I thought with everything that we've done - and learned... - I know. I know. I'm sorry. But I have spent so much time letting the Madison go. I'm just not really sure my heart can take it. - It's okay. We understand. - Please don't think that I'm not excited about tomorrow night. I-I really can't wait. But after that, I think we need to move on. - ♪ Don we now our gay apparel... ♪ - Turned out Meg had things mostly handled, so we're just gonna watch the movie tomorrow night, have the best Christmas that we can... - And then you go home. - Yeah. But I mean, I can... I can visit more. We could try to make this work. [chuckles] - I think we'd just be setting ourselves up for heartbreak. - ♪ Silent night... - You know, sometimes you just... have to be practical. - ♪ All is calm... - Right, yeah. Yeah, I mean, there's the distance and the time that it would take. - It's not just that. - You know, even if things were simpler, I... I don't know that I'm ready. - Oh. [sighs] JENNIFER: You excited about tonight? - Uh, yeah. I mean, we did a good test with the projector. Nan, Pop, and I made some cupcakes for concessions, so... I think we're ready. - Good. - Good morning. - Hi. - Hey. Is it close enough to Christmas that we can start having cookies for breakfast? - All in favor? - [Nan and Pop laugh] - There you go. - What... - Here you go. - What is this? - Open it. - Ohh. [gasps] Simon. - Wow. - So... found it in the projection booth, and I was thinking if we couldn't have the actual thing, that maybe we could give this one some new life. - You remind me of him, you know, my brother. He used to spend time in every conversation listening, waiting, and then, when you least expected it, he would say or do something so kind. [chuckles] - Why don't we put that on the mantel? - Now we'll have the whole Christmas village together. [laughs] - [whispering] Nice work. - You, too. Now come on. Let's go shovel the walkway to the theater. - Wait a minute. [sighs] - Merry Christmas, Mom. - Merry Christmas. Wow. [laughs] Looks like we're a little late. - Oh, no. No, there's still plenty shoveling left, - you wanna join me. - Sure. Looks like you got it. - Ohh! - [giggles] - Oh, no! - Uh-oh. - I'm coming for you! - You better get him. - No, no, no. No! - My money's on her. Hah! - Look up! - Oh, no, no! Whoa! That was close. - Look, thanks for... thanks for doing all this, and, um, you don't have to worry about... - Can I clarify something that I said? - Sure. SIMON: Whoa. [laughs] - If things were different... I'd be ready. For you. For us. [sighs] I just...Madzie needs stability right now. I guess I do, too. - Yeah. I wish it were different, too. [overlapping chatter] - Hi! I'm so glad you made it. Come in. - This is a huge turnout. - I think we did some good here. Should we go in? - Yeah. - Oh, why, thank you, young lady. - Have fun. - We will. - Hi. - Oh, you've done it. - Hey. - You really... Oh, look at this place. - Yeah, well, it was mostly this guy. - No one in this family does anything by themselves. - Hey! - Hi! - Nice bow tie. - Thanks. Rules of the season. Also I heard you fixed the mini-Madison. - Yeah, but there's still one more Christmas piece missing in the village. - Oh, is it? 'Cause somebody did some shopping recently, and I think maybe they helped out. - [gasps] Oh, honey. - "Salt Lake City." - It's perfect. Thank you, Meg. - I thought maybe we would connect the two places. - Oh, I am...Ohh! - I love you. Merry Christmas. - Hey, you guys should get your seats. - Send in the popcorn. - See you in a sec. [sighs] [crowd murmuring] - All right, I guess we should probably... - Yeah, I've got this, Mom. - Really? - ♪ Christmas is here again [applause and cheering] - ♪ Christmas is here again - Whoo-hoo! - Whoo, Whoo, Whoo! - ♪ Everybody's home for Christmas ♪ - So the Madison has always been a big part of my family. And even though the theater will probably change, it reminds me of Christmas and how being in a place or a holiday can make it better. And so I...I made something. It's about memories, but it's also about how it can take a little courage to move on. [cheers and applause] [music playing] - ♪ Got the boxes out from the attic ♪ ♪ Put the tree up in a room ♪ And unwrapped every ornament ♪ Covered in pages from last year's Sunday Tribune ♪ ♪ Just about everyone I know ♪ Reminds me of you ♪ These knickknacks are flashbacks ♪ ♪ Of yesteryears anew ♪ Oh, it's that time again ♪ ♪ Full of memories of loved ones ♪ ♪ Family, and friends ♪ But this Christmas, I know, won't compare ♪ ♪ To back when you were here ♪ I guess there's always last year ♪ - I'll be back. - ♪ Guess there's always last year ♪ - That's so cute. - [cheering] [music fades] [classic film music playing] [sleigh bells jingling in music] [muffled music continues] - [sighs] I wish everything could stay exactly the way it is right now. - Hmm. [yelps] - [laughs] - Just two sweet old ladies sitting on a countertop. - Emphasis on the old. - True. - All I need is you, me, and a comfortable place to sit down. - Mm. And snacks. - [chuckles] - Ah! - Oh. Yes. - Here. Yeah. You ever been down in the basement? It's huge. It's big enough to have a full-on restaurant-sized kitchen. - A movie theater restaurant's a really good idea. - I know. - Mm-hmm. - It's an expensive idea, but... I wanna do it. I should do it. - You should. I would help you. - Well, you can't. You're... you gotta go do whatever's next for you, that next big thing in France or... - I canceled my flight. - What? - [laughs] I love Salt Lake. Whatever's next for me, I think it's there. I mean, if I could keep working for you for a bit... - Well, truth be told, we should probably just... - go into business together. - Go into business together. - Wait. So that would mean we... - Pool our resources while we... - Run the restaurant together. - You build the kitchen. - And keep the Madison in the family. - And we build whatever's next... - together. - Together. [gasps] - Ohh. - [chuckles] - But wait, wait, wait. We're getting ahead of ourselves. We need to run it by Mom first. - Well, I think our odds are pretty good. [crowd cheering] - [gasps] Councilman. Hello. - Queen of dodgeball. - [both laugh] - Mom. - Hey, thank you so much for your help with everything. - I had such a great time working on this with you. - Me, too. - Guys, that went great. - Yeah, it did. - I loved that movie. Everyone said exactly what they meant. [laughter] - It was just like old times in that theater. - Yeah. - [laughs] - Jennifer, gotta hand it to you. The way the people came out tonight, it's good to know that once we take ownership, we'll have... NAN: Actually, Steve, we, uh... - I think the deal is off. - What? - The girls have decided to run the theater together. - Are you sure? - Mm-hmm. - We are. - Well... merry Christmas, Swifts. - And merry Christmas to you. - Merry Christmas. - So we're staying? - [laughs] - We're staying. POP: Come on, everybody. We have got the best red velvet everything, - and it's on the house. - [laughs] - See you outside? - Yeah. - [whispering] He's very cute. [normal] I'll see you in the city. - I can't wait to get started. Oh, I love you. - Love you. Come on. - I'm so glad you guys came. - Yeah. - It was good, right? Yeah, of course. - Good night. Bye. - Bye. - Bye. - Oh, it's freezing. - I know. - Oh. Bye. - Bye. - So... - [laughs] - So... - So... - [chuckles] - You know, I've got those, uh, kitchen designs. - Do you? - If you want 'em. As long as they conform to the original. - It's very important that we preserve the historic... - Very, very, very important. - Hmm. You sure you're ready to build the kitchen with me? - I'm on your team if you're on mine. - Everybody always said we'd be unstoppable. [music playing] [sleigh bells jingling] [instrumental playing]
