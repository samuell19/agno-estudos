Hey, Sarah. I don't care who I'm up against, I've worked way too hard for the chance to be lead on this case. Look, I know no case is a slam dunk ever, I get it, but this could put me on the track for partnership. You know no one is gonna outwork me, Sarah. You know that. I understand that, but... Oh, hold on. Hi, can I have a non-fat, no whip mocha, with an added shot of espresso? Mm-hmm. - It's right here. - Thanks. 4.52. That's quite the order. I'm expecting a challenging day. Hey, no judgment. - Keep the change. - Oh, thank you, it'll be right out. Yeah, I'm still here. Large black coffee, please. Um. Oh, boy. 1.81. I'm in the coffee shop, why? - Thank you. - What? The meeting was supposed to be this afternoon? I can't believe this. Thank you. Ladies first. Of course I have all the stuff, but I was hoping for more time to prepare. Is there any way you can hold them off... Hey, lady, get out of the way. This day's off to a great start. Here, take these. Sarah, are you kidding? They don't even match. They're already in there, you got a better idea? Come on. When did you get so bossy? I'm not bossy, I'm assertive. Now, get in there. Thanks. No doubt, when I turn on the old signature charm, the plaintiff's not gonna be able to do anything, but agree to the settlement. So no, I don't worry about it... Sorry. Nice of you to join us, Allison. Okay, Max, why don't you wind this up? Sure thing, mum. Deirdre. So quick summary, for those of you just tuning in, I'm gonna win. Okay, you're up next, Allison. Sorry, I was really hoping to troubleshoot this before the meeting, but I just found out it got moved up 15 minutes ago. You're wasting precious time, Allison. Okay, we'll just work from my laptop. Okay, nevermind. All right, so after reviewing the case, I saw that Kyle had filed a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction against Dr. Jones, but it was denied. Then we tried to appeal, but failed to overturn the decision, so I've reviewed the doctor's deposition and affidavit, but I feel like it will be difficult to get a ruling in our favor, since 4.2 in the contract states, a private practice exclusion to the non-compete. So I think if we go to trial, we might have a problem with the jury being sympathetic to Dr. Jones, just based on his reputation in the community. Let me just stop you right there, Allison. We appreciate your efforts and taking over this case. However, sometimes it's not how hard you work, it's how smart you work. It's not about whether we're going to get a judgment or not on this case, it's about filing one thing after another, until this doctor can no longer afford to defend himself. As we represent the hospital, which has endless funds, if you stretch this out, we win in the end. The only thing that's concerning me is the defendant's attorney, Derrick Walker, comes from a strong line of attorneys and he's one of the best. You, young lady, are gonna have to dominate. No excuses. Bad? Yeah, I had a whole minute to get myself ready, and it sounds like this Derrick Walker's gonna be real problem. Judging by his pre-trial communications, the guy's a real shark, he definitely goes for the jugular. Great. He just keeps filing motions to move things up, so I don't have time to depose everybody. Seriously, Sonni, are you gonna be ready for this? I have to be. This is my chance to get on the radar with the partners. I just wish I didn't have so much extra work lately. You mean so much of Max's work. You do everything for him and he takes all the credit. We're a team, it's an investment in the relationship. Ah, you call that a relationship? You two can't even be seen together in public. Well, he said that if his parents knew we were seeing each other, it might derail my chances of becoming a junior partner, that they might think I was mooching off their son. You mooching off of him? He's the one that doesn't do anything... Hey, babe. Speak of the devil. All right, go make yourself busy, "Stranger Thing". "American Psycho". Not really sure that's appropriate office behavior, Max. Oh, no, you're right, she shouldn't be putting her shoes up on the desk like that. No, and you shouldn't be talking to her like that, just because she's an assistant. Well, considering it's my name on the side of the building, I'm pretty sure I get to decide what's acceptable, hmm? I'm pretty sure that's not how it works at all. So we still on for tonight? Not after you threw me under the bus in the meeting. Oh, come on. You know I've got to throw up a little smoke screen every now and then, so nobody finds out about us. That was a fortress, not just a smoke screen. You know how I feel about you, hmm? Actually, sometimes it's very vague. Babe, look, I totally need you. Speaking of which, if we're not on for tonight, any chance I can get you to have a little look through these files for me? You were just in the meeting, your parents were grilling me, I have to work on this Walker case. Ah, come on, please? Pretty please? I'll tell you what, do this for me, help me out and I swear I'll make it up to you. Maybe take you somewhere special, hmm? I don't know. Maybe we could talk about our long-term plans for the future, hmm? You'd like that, right? Well, it would be nice to know where we stood. Then, it's a date. Thanks, babe. 10:00a.m., okay, plenty of time. No, I'm telling you, get the motion to expedite discovery filed by this afternoon. I want this thing wrapped up ASAP. I don't care when this Allison Williams thinks it should happen, she's a newbie. Look, just get it done. Hey, hey. Wake up, wake up, wake up. What? You fell asleep while working, you've now entered cliche workaholic territory. You've got to get home and cleaned up, they can't see like this. It's all part of my plan for world domination. Ah, go home, shower and pull yourself together, woman. I'll cover for you. But I've have so much more work to do. No, not looking like that, you don't. Here. Oh my gosh, I look like a raccoon. Worse, roadkill. Now, sneak out and don't let any suits see you, go. Looks like someone had a rough night. Sonni, you know I love your work ethic, but can you please focus on something else for, like, two minutes? - Okay. - Thank you. Now, what do you think about this? Ooh, I love this. That was a test. This one would be horrible for you. Your decision-making privileges have been revoked. Hmm. Ooh, what about this one? Is this another test? Mm-mm. No way, that is way out of my pay grade. You said this was gonna be for a big night, something memorable. Plus, you could totally wear this one again. You have to think of it in terms of cost per wear. What? It's not the cost of the item. It's the cost, divided by how many times you can wear it. I think you can get three to five wears out of this. That's like getting it 70% off. Really? That's right. Now, can you please tell me what the special occasion is? It's Max and my first time out in public as a couple, since we've been together. He's been acting weird lately, so I think he has something really big planned. By lately, do you mean his entire life? I bet he was a weird little kid, too. I just hope this dress goes with any other accessories I might be getting. No, no, no. Do you really think he's gonna propose? We'll see. I'm now an accomplice to this crime. Sarah, what did you do? I can hear you. Mm. Oh, cute. Forecast mostly sunny skies today, no rain is expected for two or three days, but it'll be clear tonight. And tomorrow, more sunshine. Hey, babe. So sorry I'm late. Client drinks thing ran late, couldn't get out. You're way past late, Max. You could've at least called. What can I say, I can't just leave, that'll make the Murphy and Murphy Law Firm look real bad, and that'll mean we look bad. Well, if we hurry, we can probably still get a table. Oh, babe, it's been a rough day. I'm so tired, let's just chill. Oh, yeah, I ordered on the way over. I'm starving. 33.11. Ah, babe, you know what? I think I left my wallet down in the car. Can you grab this one? Oh, these guys. Don't judge me. Oh, yeah, and after we eat, can you have a little look through the notes from the files in my bag, I am toast. I just need to, like, zone out for a bit. Maxwell Murphy, you cannot be serious? What? I mean, if I'm gonna be your plus one for this wedding next weekend, I can't leave with a bunch of work undone. You know as well as I, we can work this out so that your client doesn't have their personal and professional life exposed. The hospital has unlimited funds and they are not gonna stop until your client is forced out of the state. And how much longer can you afford your legal fees? Well, I'm sorry to hear that you see it that way. I'll see you in court. Sounds like that went well. He just filed another motion to move things up. This guy is just so smug, I already can't stand him. How's it going, girls? Well, I have something that'll cheer you up, I scheduled a wine tasting tonight. Sample wines for the wedding and Rob can't go, so can you two come with? I have so much work I need to do today... Come on, the wedding is this weekend and I have so much to do between now and then. I made a list of things I need you guys to help me with, so we can go over them while we're sampling wines. Girl, you had me at unlimited free alcohol. Oh, I never said unlimited free alcohol. Sonni and I would be honored to join you. Great, so it's settled. I'll see you guys at the wine shop at six. Don't be late. Ta-ta, darlings. I love Becca, but I don't think she realizes how important this case is to my career, and now we have a list of things we have to work on? Watch out, the wild bridezilla has appeared, ah! I mean, I've known Becca since college, but I had no idea what I was signing up for when I became a bridesmaid. Just remember, we get to stay at a nice resort, sun, sand, oceans, drinks. You're starting to sound like Max. He stayed at the same resort when he was there for spring break a few years ago and he's really excited, it's kind of cute. Did you just compare me to Max? Okay, we're officially not on speaking terms until the wine tasting. Oh, not the silent treatment. Mm, mm-mm. Sarah, come on. Max isn't that bad. I love you. See any wines you recognize? With Becca's country club taste, what do you think? Right? And only Becca could be so ultra organized that she'd give us a study guide before the wine tasting. Oh, no, bridezilla, ah! - Oh, I'm sorry. - I'm so sorry. Wait, you. Me? From the coffee shop. Oh, hi. I'm so sorry, I was in the way. No, I wasn't paying attention. It's almost as much my fault. Well, actually... Well, I'll let you ladies get on with your night, it looks like you have a wine tasting to go to. Nice running into you. What, too soon? Too cheesy. Too late, actually. Well, you ladies have a good night. So how do you know that piece of man candy? I don't know, we just keep seeing each other around. I don't even know his name, but he seems like a nice guy. Mm-hmm, hmm. Mm, magnificent. - Try some, won't you? - Oh, thanks. I said, don't be late. You guys don't realize how much precision goes into planning a wedding, every minute matters. Sorry, we got a little caught up, but let's get to work. Right, work. Now, does this come in a large? Ladies, welcome. I've laid out a number of samples here for you to try. Just please make yourself at home and if you have any questions at all, don't hesitate to ask. Great, thanks. So Sarah, what'd you decide, you bringing a date to my big day? First of all, it is not just a day, it is a very long a weekend that we're also happy to be sharing with you, of course. But no, I will not be bringing a date. Statistics show that weddings are the number one place to meet a partner. I don't need a plus one cramping my style, you know? Fair enough. And Sonni, you're bringing Max. Don't worry, I know it's hush, hush. Becca. What? It's just, there's going to be a lot of lawyers with your friends and Robs and word travels. So... I mean, it's got to come out sooner or later though, right? I can't imagine meeting my soulmate and not being able to shout it from the rooftops. It was love at first sight, you know? At that coffee shop, he was wearing that cute vest, the barista called for Rolo when she misread Rob's name on the cup. When you find that special person, you know it's just meant to be. But seriously, Sonni, you have such high standards for everything else in your life. Why settle for a leech like Max? He's not a leech, he treats me just fine. Okay, there aren't a lot of good guys that fit the lawyer lifestyle. Girl, tell me about it. That's why I have cats. No, no, no, no cats. Max is a great catch for Sonni, a real power couple, and besides, you can train him to do better. Oh, so cats are a no, but you apparently can have a dog. Well, praise and rewards do work. - Check, please. - Check, please. Ms. Williams, you are late. Late by, like, maybe two minutes, I'm still one of the first people here. Well, not everybody's working the Walker case. He's probably done more in the past two minutes than, like, Kyle does in a day, which is why I took him off the case and put you on it. Morning, Henry. Another great day to be alive. Isn't it, though? He is so stupid. Look, I don't want you to think I'm not putting the work in, I am, I've barely taken a break. But you did have time for this wine tasting. Blended oak, nice wine here. Speaking of that, I hope you're not thinking of making this weekend into kind of a getaway, because Walker is trying to push up the timeline on this case. So I'll need you to have your case built by Monday. Monday, I'm not getting back until Monday? Look, I know you're working very hard to make junior partner, and winning this case could put you in line for that. But don't take this lightly, when it comes to the Walkers, just when you think you've won, you've lost. Let's get to work. Ooh, nice. Where'd you get your hands like that, man? I have never seen anyone make their catches this way. It's a gift, what can I say? You've either got it or you don't. Oh, I played football in high school, thank you very much, I just haven't had a lot of time to practice. Matter of fact, I haven't had a lot of time to do anything. Man, what's wrong with you? You need a girlfriend or something. No, that'll just take up more time. Maybe you can get a dog or a cat, even a fish, you know? A gateway commitment-level pet. Nah, I'm holding out for the real deal, man. Right now, I'm just happy staying busy with work and getting my weekly bro time in with my homie. Hey, I know that girl. Hey, I think she wants the ball. What? Throw her the ball. Oh. Ah. Ooh. Oh, no, are you okay? I'm so sorry. I think I'm still in tact, it just caught me off guard. I thought you were calling for the ball. Oh, no. I mean, I realize you don't know me, but I can assure you, I would never be calling for the ball. Well, you're out for a run, so you must have some sort of athletic ability. Running is more of a stress reliever for me, but it looks like you guys were having fun, I'm jealous. DJ. I think introductions are in order this time. I'm Sonni. Marlin. Oh, hi, I'm Sonni. I'm his mentor for the Big Brother program. Oh, what an amazing thing to do? Is he a worthy mentor, Marlin? DJ's a good dude. Although, sometimes it feels like I'm mentoring him. That's true, he is wise beyond his years, this one. Very wise. Well, Sonni, I think we could be considered acquaintances now. I think that's a fair classification. Well, I'm gonna let you get back to your stress relief. I've got to get Marlin home, so he can hit the books. Oh, well, it was nice to officially meet you, since we keep running into each. Oh, yeah, I just moved into the neighborhood. I guess we'll be seeing more each other, then. Or we will tragically never see each other again. It could go either way. I guess we'll have to take our chances. Well, have a good day, guys. She's pretty great, yeah. I know, pretty good.

Well, this isn't a party, it's a wedding, and if anything, it's someone else's party. Okay, well, you've clearly never been to Myrtle Beach. I ran that show last time I was there. Are you sure your parents don't know we're going together? Nah, I mean they're too busy focused on their little luxury cruise to be worried about anything else. Yeah, except the Walker case. Allison, can you, like, try and have a little fun maybe. This is gonna be a special weekend for us, too. Yeah, yeah, I can. Okay, I'll be right out. This is gorgeous. Just as I remember her. Please don't ruin this for me, Max. Oh, there you are. Hey, be careful, there's alligators in there. Yeah, I know, I'm trying to see one. So I guess you got my text? Yeah, about that, my thighs are allergic to running, so maybe we just walk. Yeah, we can go for a walk. Cool. Where's golden boy? Oh, he made an important phone call that he has to finish and I should be working too, but I just needed some fresh air. Yeah, girl, you need a break, but I am surprised that Max isn't out here. Well, we're gonna go for a walk on the beach later. Yeah, no, I'm surprised that you're out here and he's actually inside working for once. Sarah, I know you don't like Max... Hah. But he was so sweet in college and he got me through law school. I just think he's really stressed out right now. He's being a bit of a jerk, I know, but this weekend will be good for us. I'm only being protective, but I will try to lay off of him. Thank you. Ooh, hey, do me a favor? What? Let me do your makeup tonight? That, plus your dress, and every pair of eyes will be on you. I don't know. Trust me. Just come by my room around six. Okay, fine. Yeah. Right, where is this bar? How many drinks are you gonna have tonight? Well, remember, we're gonna have a really long day tomorrow. Hey, this is for Becca and Rob, - so please behave. - Yeah, yeah, Becca and Rob. - Oh- - There they are, come on. I'm so happy you're here. We made it, you look so cute. Thank you. Hey, Allison. Hey, Rolo. How have we let it be so long? I mean, we're all so busy, but it's great to have a weekend away from it all. Yeah, hopefully. No, Allison, no working this weekend. That's a demand from the bride to her bridesmaid. Welcome to my world. It won't interfere, Becca, I promise. Oh my gosh, there's Darlene, my best friend from high school. I'll catch up with you later, though. Yeah. Love you, mean it. Robby. Buddy. My dudes. Sorry. It was so great seeing you, Allison, Max, I got to go catch up with my boys. That's what you get when you let them dogs run wild. Aren't they the cutest couple? I hope people think that we're... See? I told you look like $1 million in that dress. Now, where is your date? He's at the bar, determined to make spring break happen. My bad. Oh, geez. Ooh. Now, who's looking at the menu? Your girl's hungry. I got a lead on an eligible bachelor. Becca's pretty sure we'll get along, so I think I'm gonna, accidentally end up at his table. Well, you are a force of nature, so good luck on your man quest. Hey, stranger. Long time, no see. Oh, hey babe. Are you having fun? Well, you know, considering I don't really know anybody, it's all right. But hey, there's free booze, so cheers to that. - Well, you know me. - Mm-hmm.

Oh, DJ, I'm one of the groomsmen. Oh, childhood friend, huh? Yes, sir. So why are you bartending? You should be relaxing and mingling. To be honest with you, Sonni, I got the bill for this place. I didn't realize weddings were so expensive, now I'm saving every penny. Anything for my sweetheart. What are you drinking? I'm not really much of a drinker, I can't stand the taste of liquor. How about lemon drop? The signature drink of the night. Yeah. I got a sweet deal on this, limonchello, sweeter than candy, you're gonna love it. That's delicious. I would take it easy on those things, they have a kick. No way, it doesn't taste like liquor. That's how they get you. But I've seen what they can do to a person and it is not pretty, let me tell you. Then, what do you suggest? Honestly, water. It's late, we have a long couple of days ahead of us and no one ever regretted getting hydrated, right? Smart man right there. Well, I'll let you guys catch up.

I mean, you've got to take advantage of those perks. It's not a vacation, it's a wedding, and I have to go because I'm a bridesmaid, but you're one of Becca's friends too. Yeah, but babe, all this, like, wedding crap, it's kind of boring for me. You're my date. Look, you'll be fine, okay? Sarah's gonna be there and you're way better at meeting new people than I am. Go meet yourselves some new friends, all right? Seriously, Max, this is supposed to be a romantic weekend, you, me, us. Come on, babe, don't pressure me. I don't think it's unreasonable to ask you to go to a couple of these things with me. Okay, look, I'll be here when you get back, and then we'll hang, hmm? Drink up, people, this stuff's expensive. Allison, hi. Is this seat taken? No, it's all yours. Oh. Sonni, I got you a tiara as well. Aren't these so fun? Oh, yeah. Thanks. Don't say a word. Got it. Where's Max? He had some work he needed to do. So how did you two meet each other? So for a little fun, we're gonna play bridal party trivia, so you can get to know the bride and groom, and get to know each other. So you're gonna need to find the person that you're walking down the aisle with. Sonni, I see you already found DJ. - Darlene, you're with Andy. - Hi. - Austin, you're with Erica. - I'd like to see you. So it looks like we'll be walking down the aisle together. What? Oh, I mean, yeah, we're gonna be paired up. At least I'll know someone in this dog and pony show. Right? I mean, I love a good wedding, but all the lead up is a little much. Right, it's everything that happens after you say I do that matters, right? Thank you. Okay, first question. How did Rob and I first meet? Oh, I actually known this one. Good thing Sarah's not here, she would hate this. Sarah? Oh, she's around here somewhere, she's probably scoping out guys. Hey, what's up, brother? How's that yellow board been treating you? Rad man. I just need you to sign here. Trying to impress the ladies, are we, Max? I'll give you a quick run through on how we do this. - Nah, I'm good, I've got it. - You got it? Yeah, it'll work. All right, man, rock and roll? You have a good time, all right. This aught to be good. What aught to be good? Oh, hey. Hello. The... paddleboarding. The wedding party gets free rentals, so I was thinking about using one later. Well, hopefully you're better than that guy. Whoa, geez. Oh, yeah, I totally wasn't even watching him. Oh, I take it you're not going to the brunch either? No, I just really don't know many people there. - Yeah. - Figured I'd come hang out at the beach, but now I am starving. Why don't me and you go get something to eat not at the brunch? Yeah. Whoa, oh, ah. Yeah, I think I have some time to kill. Let's do it. I can't believe you can't stand the feel of chalk, how did you get through school? Well, when whiteboards became popular, I was good to go. Oh, and I'm so with on open mouth eaters. It should be literally illegal, unless medically necessary. And you chose Beatles over Rolling Stones, no way, come on. Way. And I can't believe you would pick "Star Trek" over "Star Wars". I've actually never seen "Star Wars", so... You've never seen "Star Wars"? You've never seen "Star Wars"? Wait, you're an only child? What was that like? It was fine, you know, at the time. But, you know, now I really wish I had somebody to roll my eyes with when my dad tells the same story for the 100th time. But you have five sisters, how was that? It can be hard to get a word in sometimes, but they taught me a lot about women, so... Yeah, I mean, that's probably why you're so considerate, you know? Opening doors, pulling out chairs, very gentlemanly. Well, growing up, my father insisted on it. Actually, growing up, if you didn't do that, my dad would just whack you in the back of the head, so... is it really that unusual? You have no idea. Mm-mm. So now you've had a chance to get to know us and to get to know each other, but I've saved the biggest surprise for last. This afternoon, we're gonna learn a special dance that we're all gonna do together at the reception, isn't that amazing? So check your itineraries and we'll meet up in a few hours. Don't be late. Now, we have to learn one of those embarrassing dances. I knew those dance classes would come in handy some day. I've never taken dancing classes. Don't worry, we're in this together, I'll make you look good. Thank you. So how are you planning on killing the next few hours? I was gonna probably go for a walk on the beach. I should probably go find Max, if you wanna join? Sure. Hey, I'm looking for someone. He was in gray trunks, with orange palm leaves on it. British guy. Oh, yeah, that guy. Tense dude. Do you know when he's due back? Oh, man, he was due back, like, two hours ago. Not cool. How could he be gone for so long? He's never even been on a paddleboard. Do you think he's okay, or... You have to go look for him. No can do, I got to stay with the stand. He's probably all right. Probably? Does this look like the kind of place where anything bad happens? I mean, the wedding party rides for free, right? Why don't we just go look for him? Yeah, that's a good idea. Yeah? I only got one board left, you guys have to share it. Oh, that's fine. - Sure. - Yeah. All right, you wanna do a run through on dry land? Right here. All right, have you ever done this before? No. All right, so you just wanna distribute your weight evenly - from the side- - Ah. Oh, I got you. You know, this might actually be fun if it wasn't for a search party. Right? I know. Let's uh... Max? Oh, I gotta go help him, you don't wanna see this. So I'll see you at the dance rehearsal? Yeah, I'll see you later. Ah, oh god. Oh, ah, ah. - Max? - Hey. Are you okay? Ah, don't touch me. Don't touch me. - Where have you been? - It burns. I just lost track of time. Dude, where's the paddleboard? Oh, I parked it for you. Come on, babe. Parked it? Where? Out there. Come on, man. Dude! - Oh my gosh. - I'm killing it, babe. - I was killing it, man. - Oh my gosh. I don't know what happened. - Oh, it hurts. - It's everywhere. Oh, it hurts so bad. My gosh. Oh god, do you want a drink? - No. - Oh, that's all right. So what's with the binoculars, then? They're for bird watching. Bird watching? Mm-hmm. What kind of birds are we talking about here? Like seagulls? 'Cause, you know, they're pretty easy to spot without those. Do you wanna play darts? Darts? Yeah, let's do it. Darts. Okay, so I'm watching my friend's boyfriend. So you're into him? Ew, no. Absolutely not. It's just he's wrong for her in, like, every way. But she doesn't see it, so I'm just trying to prove it. What, like a private investigator? Kind of. So how's your investigation going, detective? Well, it was going really well, until I got interrupted by a very distracting guy. And my target, I think, is lost at sea. Wait, lost at sea? Oh, don't worry about it. He's kind of like a cockroach, he'll come crawling back. You've got to be kidding me. What? Right on cue. You should get a stretch in, bro. I don't know, dude, my body's always ready for it. You, guys, I don't think this dance is what you think it is. What are you talking about? If I didn't know any better, I would think you were trying to get out of dance lessons. No, I just had to fire off a couple of emails. - Ah. - I wouldn't abandon you. Good, 'cause if I'm gonna humiliate myself, I'm taking you down with me. I promised I'd make you look good. Okay, guys, let's gather around. Hello, everybody. My name is Santino and I am your wedding dance instructor. Now, we don't have much time to rehearse, but this is a fun dance that I just know you'll all crush. There are a few sections, but for now, let's start with the tango. Becca and Rob, let's demo this. And five, six, seven, eight. Okay, let's get into pairs, I need to see what I'm dealing with. Come on, let's go. This is clearly not their first time doing this. She's definitely been practicing. Like, for a while. They expect us to learn this in 24 hours, that's impossible. Oh, come on. Nobody puts baby in a corner. Get out there. Okay, I don't know what that means, but- Yeah, okay, and then we go like this. - Like this? - Yeah, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. - Right, like that. - Okay. Then step back. - Yeah. Oh. - Oh god, I'm so sorry. - Are you okay? All right - It's okay, it's okay. Yeah up, and then this way. - Yep. - Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep. Oh, and they... - Is that a dip? - I don't... How do I do this? Ooh, ooh. - Oh, I don't know how- - Oh, the dip, okay. Great job, Becca and Rob, great job. And as for the rest of you, why don't we just start with the basics? So that's him, huh? He doesn't look like such a bad guy. Well, looks can be deceiving. I mean, he's just, like, sitting there by himself drinking, I don't think we're gonna see much. You're right, he's here to drink. I have an idea. Hey, I didn't mean to suggest anything. - Excuse me. - Yes? This is gonna be a little weird but... Yeah, yeah, okay. Uh-huh. Like this? Mm-hmm. Yeah, you're getting good. - I'm getting good? - Mm-hmm. Great. Okay, woo, okay, yep. - You getting dizzy? - A little bit. Hey, I didn't order this. From your secret admirer, come find me. Much obliged. I said, much obliged. Really, hmm? No one wants to take credit for this, huh? I mean, I appreciate the gesture, right? Yeah? But it's getting a bit rude now, all right? Go on, try it. You gave it to me, right? No? You? Right, next time you order somebody a drink, just own up to it, all right? 'Cause I know it was you, love. - Oh, no. - You've got that look - in your eye. - I... I can't do this. Okay, no, no, no, no. All right, bye! So how do you know Max? We went to school together. Oh, a lot of people do it like that. He's an interesting guy. Well, what about you? Did you bring a plus one? No, I had a girlfriend, but we broke up about a month ago. So I guess I'm still processing, but I am so glad that I met you, because you are making this so much more bearable. Great. Okay, fabulous. Let's take a short break, go powder your noses, and then we'll come back and run it one more time. Powder my nose? Hey, everything okay? Yeah, it's just I really have some work I need to do. Do you mind if we miss this final run through? You mean, I wouldn't have to dance anymore today? Yeah, I'm cool with that. Okay, I'll see you tomorrow. Okay, see you. Hey, babe, how was the rest of your day? It sucked. Ah, what happened? You know, some people just can't own up to their actions. Sounds serious. I don't wanna talk about it. Well, I didn't have a great day either. You know the Walker case? Mm-hmm. One of Dr. Jones' patients that was recruited for his new practice dropped out. She wouldn't tell me why, she won't testify, but I'm sure Walker got to her. Mm. You know, I wanna believe that law can be practiced ethically, but I can't personally support the hospital's case. I mean, they're just this big bully and this doctor's just trying to take care of his patients. I mean, I know this case is important, but... Sweetie, it's not too late to cancel the florist. I can make arrangements just as pretty, see? Dad, where did you even get these? Outside. We're paying guests, this should be complimentary for the beautiful bride. Dad, I can't deal with this right now. Can you please put these back where you found them? And do not cancel the florist. Ah. Stop it. What? Ah. Sonni. Hey, how are you? So good. I'm so in love with this place, with the weather- With your fiance? Of course, I was building to that. Oh, sorry. Do you know what I'm not in love with? What's that? Having a bridesmaid preoccupied with work. It's just this case. You know I'm under a lot of pressure, but I'm here for you. You're the best. Try a little harder. You're kidding me? I was working on that. Ah! No, man, I wouldn't miss your wedding for the world. I know, I know. I just assumed your work stuff might get in the way. You know, Becca would have killed us both if you messed with her plan. Oh, no way. Look, this case is tough, but it's gonna wind up in my client's favor. It's just this new lawyer is putting up way more of a fight than I thought she would. Well, if anyone can get the job done, it's you. Thanks man. No problem. Hey, y'all ready to get Rob-ed. Yeah. Oh my gosh, are you okay? Yeah, I can't really answer that, it really hurts. I'm so sorry. You hurt your foot? Hey. Hey. Any updates in the investigation? No. I think I was looking for something that wasn't there. Max might've broke his toes, though, so there's that. Oh, I am so sorry to hear that. I thought you're onto something. Yeah, me too. Dear hotel guests, my name's Becca, and I'm lucky enough to be your bride for the week- Ma'am, you can't use the telephone for personal announcements. If you're a part of Becca and Rob's wedding, the rehearsal'll be starting outside in 15 minutes. I hope you're enjoying your stay. Cool. Cool. You seem a bit stressed. Sorry, it's just this case I'm working on. Guys, it's your turn. Well, it's a beautiful day, and maybe you should just take some time off and enjoy it, you know? Plus, if I don't have someone to talk to, I'm gonna go crazy from boredom. Well, I hate to break it to you, but we're about to split up. You think you're gonna be okay by yourself? I'll do my best. Wonderful. At this point in the ceremony, the bride will enter with her father. Thanks, dad. And now, we'll go over the vows. Becca, you make me wanna be better. I wanna live life truly and deeply now that you're in it. You know the guy that Sonni's partnered with? DJ, I think? Yeah, but, like, who is he? He's Rob's friend from, like, way back. He's a lawyer now. When we go hours without talking because of work and I come home stressed, which is often. You always bring me back to happy. And I wanna be happy together for the rest of our lives. I love you. Robert- sorry. Sorry, I just love weddings so much, getting a little choked up already. Robert, Rolo. I knew the minute that we met each other in that coffee shop, my life would never be the same. You always keep me laughing and you keep me guessing. All right, that will be the end of the ceremony. At this point, we will follow the bride and groom back down the aisle. So was this all part of your strategy? What are you talking about? You know exactly what I'm talking about, Derrick. Wait, what? You're Derrick Walker. Yeah, I know. So why did you tell me your name was DJ? 'Cause that's what I go by, at least when I'm not working. Wait, what's going on? You and I are going to court in less than a week. What are you... You're Allison Williams. Like you just figured it out. But you said your name was Sonni. That's what I go by. Well, I wish I could say this was some grand plan that I came up with, but it's not. Really? Really. Yet, this doesn't feel random. Did you have your friend put us together so you could get close to me? Are you kidding me? With your reputation, I don't wanna be anywhere near you. Oh, how convenient? Yeah it is. Hey, are you doing okay? No, I'm confused, and I thought Derrick was a nice guy, but I guess I'm no judge of character. I'm gonna go talk to Max, maybe he's the one. But... You just said you're no judge of character, okay? Yeah, but, I mean, if he's the one, I wanna start now. Good luck with that. So, honey, I'm really happy to be here with you. Yeah, and that's why you're spending all your time with some other dude. He's my partner for the wedding, I have to spend time with him. Yeah, still, I don't like him. I don't like him either. You know who I do like? Who? You. So if we were to get married, what would it be like? Babe, you know I'm not ready, like... I know, just hypothetically? Well, hypothetically, first of all, like, it will be huge, right? Massive, okay? Probably the biggest anyone in the office has ever seen. Really? I always wanted something a little more private, just, you know, my closest friends. Nah, I wanna make sure we make the society section of the paper, you know? Like, really good PR for the firm. Yeah, good PR. Look, babe, can we have this conversation another time? If your dad is doing the DJing, why can't I sing at your wedding? I mean, you can't sing, for one. Excuse me. Mom, you're not singing at the wedding. - Just- - No. Okay, well, what about another... Becca, I can't even- I am so sorry, I didn't realize. Why don't we just switch partners? It's too late, and you guys match up perfectly as a couple for photos, you know how much that means to me. Do you understand how awkward this is for me? Do you expect to- Sonni, just one more day. Thank you for putting my special day ahead of this. It means a lot. Do you want another brownie? You can have Rob's, he doesn't eat it. I just think Becca is the most beautiful bride I've ever seen. That's so true, she's gorgeous. Okay, just a little. It's worth it. Okay, these earrings. I'm just shaking. I'm the one that should be shaking, mom. Ooh, sorry. Hey, pretty people. Hi. Oh, no, no, don't wanna smudge the makeup. Only air kisses until - Oh - after the ceremony - Hey. - Hi, Sweetie. Hey. Sorry, I didn't see your text till this morning. You okay? What's going on? It wasn't important. Just that... think all this wedding stuff is starting to get to me, I couldn't sleep. Still wanna talk about it? No, let's just get through this day. Do you mind? What? Can I just play a little? I mean, you already look amazing, but I think a little more drama for the photos, huh? I usually try to avoid drama. Trust me. Okay. So what was so important you missed my text? Not much, just getting better acquainted with Brian. Sarah has a boyfriend. Well, I wouldn't say that yet. But you like him? Yeah, kind of. Well, I'm happy for you, you deserve it. Thanks. Now, take a look at my masterpiece. What have you done? You don't like? Are you kidding? It's amazing, I look so pretty. Listen to me, you are so much more than pretty, you are beautiful, but you're also kind and funny and super smart. And forgive me for saying it, but you deserve to be treated like a princess. Don't forget that. Thanks, I might've needed that. I have to get dressed. Thanks, daddy, love you. Hi. Hi. Dearly beloved. We're gathered here today to join Rob and Becca in holy matrimony. I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss your bride. We did it. Nice, oh. Well, if a good wedding doesn't renew your faith in humanity, I don't know what will, right? Don't, just leave me alone. I don't wanna spar with you here. Wow, that's not the Allison Williams that I heard about. I heard she was fierce, a fighter. I've been trying to figure out how to beat her in court. I never expected her to be a quitter. And what about that girl, Sonni, I met in the park? I'd really like to see her again. What about that guy, DJ? It seems like it doesn't exist. Okay, people, let's give a big round of applause for these two love birds as they dance their first dance as a married couple. ♪ She stole my heart ♪ ♪ She stole my soul ♪ ♪ She makes me laugh ♪ ♪ She makes me smile ♪ ♪ She's my life ♪ ♪ She drives me wild ♪ ♪ You'll need to say a prayer ♪ ♪ She's just shaking what the good Lord gave her ♪ ♪ One, two, three, four ♪ ♪ Shook ah shook ah, shake it ♪ ♪ Shook ah shook ah, shake it ♪ ♪ Shook ah shook ah, shake it ♪ ♪ Shook ah shook ah, shake it ♪ ♪ Shook ah shook ah, shake it ♪ ♪ Shook ah shook ah, shake it ♪ ♪ Shook ah shook ah, shake it ♪ ♪ Shook ah shook ah, shake it ♪ ♪ Shake it till you can't shake ♪ ♪ Shake it till you can't shake ♪ ♪ Shake it till you can't shake it ♪ ♪ All right ♪ ♪ Shake it till you can't shake ♪ ♪ Shake it till you can't shake ♪ ♪ Shake it till you can't shake it ♪ ♪ All right ♪ ♪ You can welcome the day during the night time ♪ ♪ And you can get in the game or sit the side lines ♪ ♪ There's a right time ♪ ♪ And you're the right find ♪ ♪ I'm not crazy, girl ♪ ♪ I'm thinking with my wife mind ♪ ♪ I prefer to dive in ♪ ♪ So climb in ♪ ♪ I'm all in ♪ ♪ We might win ♪ ♪ Rock the boat ♪ ♪ Let her sink or swim ♪ ♪ Let the freak within ♪ ♪ Let you peek within ♪ ♪ Which are the secrets ♪ ♪ That you're stopping me from peeking in ♪ ♪ When the week is grim ♪ ♪ Grab your girls and all your friends ♪ ♪ We can hit the spot again ♪ ♪ Just watching when we're walking in ♪ ♪ Ladies on the floor make it go low ♪ ♪ And I wanna see you go till you can't go ♪ ♪ Shook ah shook ah, shake it ♪ ♪ Let me see you shake it ♪ ♪ Let me see you shake it ♪ ♪ Let me see you shake it ♪ ♪ Shook ah shook ah, shake it ♪ ♪ Let me see you shake it ♪ ♪ Let me see you shake it ♪ ♪ Let me see you shake it ♪ ♪ Shake it till you can't shake ♪ ♪ Shake it till you can't shake ♪ ♪ Shake it till you can't shake it ♪ ♪ All right ♪ ♪ Shake it till you can't shake ♪ ♪ Shake it till you can't shake ♪ ♪ Shake it till you can't shake it ♪ ♪ All night ♪ Well, I can see why this'd be such a tough case for you, going against someone so experienced. Wow, so surprising. I'm meeting an attorney with an inflated sense of ego. Not nearly as surprising as meeting a newbie who's dating a partner's son to become junior partner. That's not what... Careful, your ambition is showing. You have no idea what you're talking about. You cannot be serious about this guy. Why do you care? See you in court. All right, now, everybody get on the dance floor. Let's have some fun here, let's show 'em what you got. Girl, that was amazing. Sonni, I want you to officially meet Brian. Hello. Hi, Brian. Okay, I just have a quick little questionnaire for you to fill out. You know, basic information, criminal history, et cetera. I need to make sure you're worthy of this lady. Dude, She's totally kidding. Oh. Sorry, I have a weird sense of humor. Which is why we're such good friends. Yeah, I knew Sarah was funny, but she didn't tell me about you. Well, here's to the end of your bridesmaid duties. Cheers to that. This is not the weekend I was expecting. Mm, I'll bet. Just try not to let this Derrick thing ruin it. It's not just that, I was hoping to have more time with Max. Yeah, where is old Max, anyway? He said he needed to go somewhere quiet to make a work call. Wow, I'm surprised he didn't have you make that call. Look, this is the guy that I may end up marrying someday, I would really appreciate it if you at least tolerate him. I know, I know, But until that day comes, I'm watching your back. Probably not necessary, but thank you. I'm gonna go try to drag him back to the party. Max, are you here? Oh my gosh, I was looking for you. We're about to do the bouquet toss. Actually, I'm just looking for Max, have you seen him? Not for a while. He was outside earlier. Okay, I'll check out there. Not until after, please? Pretty please? Come on, it's my special day and I need my girls there to be in the photos. It'll only take a minute. Fine, anything for you. Great. Why are we doing this? - Ah, Becca, you know? - Okay, yeah. Give me a drum roll people. Brr. Woo-hoo. - Yay. - Yay. Yeah, that's the way, Sonni. Yay. Yeah. Isn't this amazing? You're gonna be the next happy bride. Well, not as happy as me. Oh, look. Okay, now go find Max and tell him the good news. Okay. Sorry, guys, you snooze, you lose. Max? Where is he? You really think I'm pretty? Yeah, prettiest girl here, babe. Seriously? Allison... Babe, babe, wait, come on. Okay, people, who's ready for the cake? Sonni, you ready for the cake? Am I right? Babe, wait, wait, wait, come on, just let me explain, all right? Don't you dare try to explain this. After everything I've done for you, taking care of you, done all your work and you got all the credit. He's only carrying you because he feels sorry for you. Isn't that right, babe? Look, babe, I'm pretty sure you don't wanna get in the middle of this. If I were you, I'd get far away from me as possible. I have obviously never been a fan of yours, but I never thought you'd stoop this low. It's not my fault if she can't keep her man. Whoa, babe, babe. All right, stop, all right? You're causing a bit of a scene, all right? Just tone it down a bit, okay? Come on, Sonni. This guy doesn't deserve any more of your time. Just get out of here, Max. You know what? I think that's up to Allison. Babe, like, what do you want? I think I'm not your babe. We're done, we're so done. Whatever, I'm out of here. You good, Sonni? Yeah. Okay, people, we've got three more hours in this place, let's boogie. Poor girl. What a rough way for a relationship to end, huh? You know I'm here for you if you need me, okay? Yeah, I know. I mean, shouldn't somebody go after her or something? I don't think so. I mean, if she doesn't even want her best friend with her, then she doesn't want anyone else to follow her. Sometimes a girl just needs a good cry. Now, where were we? I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. What, why? Well, because we, and by that I mean I, have a policy against people being so sad in my bar, it's bad for business. I've had a really hard night, actually a rough weekend. It can't be that bad, can it? I just broke up with my boyfriend. I caught him cheating at a wedding. Was it your wedding? No. Well, then it's still could've been worse. It does get worse. I work for his parents, so I'm never gonna make partner now. Whatever, I hated that job. Why? Why did you hate that job? Because you have to destroy good people sometimes, just made me sick. It can't always be about winning. Please tell me there's more to life? Well, it sounds like you need a drink, and the good news is you're in a bar. That's the thing, I had to get out of there and I left my wallet. So please don't kick me out. Honey, you are having a seriously epic bad night. I'll tell you what, I won't give you my shoulder to cry on, because I like this shirt too much, but drinks are on the house, what do you want? Can you make a lemon drop? Yes I can. Can I ask you a life question? Oh, a life question, Lord, Lord, Lord, they don't pay me enough. I'm kidding, go ahead, ask. How do you know if you've met the one? Well, how does anybody know? I mean, until you're old and gray and holding hands in your rocking chairs, you just never know. I really wanted Max to be the one. Why? Did he make you feel important? Actually, no. What did you feel like when you were with him? Did you feel insecure? Maybe. Maybe he didn't compliment you too much or ever? Told you your legs were too skinny and your butt was too fat. Oh, wait, I'm sorry, that's my story. I never said that. Nobody's talking to you. Here you go, one lemon drop. Tastes like candy. Is it good? Even better than the last one I had. How often did he... I bet he never said you were beautiful. No, he never said that, but, I mean, I didn't need him to say. Look, I just met you and I can already tell you're way better than whoever this guy is, whatever that mess is. You listen to me, you are young and you are beautiful, and I know there's a fierce love out there for you somewhere. Well, there is this guy that I just met, it's the first time in a long time that I thought someone could be the one. And? We had this amazing chemistry, but he just wasn't who I thought he was. I mean, come to think of it, he was the complete opposite of Max. He was caring and considerate and charming and... Oh, don't cry. Please do not cry, because I will start crying and I'm allergic to tears. I'm sorry, it's just... I told you those things have a kick. How much of that did you hear? Enough. Did you mean it? Maybe. Every word. You know, you are not at all like the Allison Williams I expected. You're definitely not the Derrick Walker I heard about either. Maybe I am, I mean, I could've been. To be honest with you, that's not the guy I wanna be anymore, I just wanna be the guy who's with you. Well, that's a little complicated since we're going to court next week. I've recused myself from the case. On what grounds? Conflict of interest. You don't have to, I'm probably gonna be unemployed after tomorrow morning. Do you think we could just start over? I mean, both of us. Maybe we should just go back to the reception. Are you kidding me? After the fireworks you set off, trust me, there's nothing to see there. It doesn't mean we can't still dance, though. There isn't a dance floor here. Trust me, we'll make it work. So I think this is an excellent way to start over. It's not bad. Oh, I'm sorry, I'm being so rude, I'm Derrick. My friends call me DJ. Hi, DJ. My name is Allison and I go by Sonni. It's nice to meet you. The pleasure's all mine. So, Sonni, I know we just met, but there is something that I've been wanting to do ever since I first saw you. What's that? This Ah, fabulous. Come see, come see. Look. - Thanks. - Nice. This is so exciting. This building is perfect. Yeah, we're gonna have to change that sign, though. Why? Allison Sonni Williams, will you marry me?
