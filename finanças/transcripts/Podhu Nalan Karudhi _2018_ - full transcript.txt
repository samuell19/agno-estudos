1990... Thirunelveli District. From a money lending family... of Palayamkottai, is a boy, Rudramurthy... who didnt want to get married and boarded the train to Chennai. In the same year, Babu Jain... a boy from Rajasthan, came to Chennai with just Rs.10001/- to become a big financier. Time will unite people with the same goal wherever they are. Time doesn't know whether the goal is a good or a bad. Babu Jain and Rudramurthy are such people whom the time has united. Such boys who came together... joined the big financier Motilal Seth in Chennai as collection boys. After 5 years like everyone feels that one has to go to the next stage in life... they too felt so. They directly go to Motilal Seth and ask him to help them start their own finance company... he says no to that and throws them out of the job. Those two, who came out dejected... plan properly and kill Motilal Seth in his own office. In 1999, by killing the teacher who taught them the work... both of them start their separate grand Finance Company in Chennai. Leaving one's country and going abroad for livelihood are not the only refugees. Leaving one's home town for the sake of monetary needs... and going to the city are also in a way, refugees. Hey, I have been telling you for the past 2 days to sell the bike but you haven't come and taken it. I am coming there. I will come. You go to the shop. - Ok. Sir, the vehicle won't fetch as per your expectation. Hey... first take the vehicle from here and leave. First we will see what's the buyer's price and then we will decide. Sir, that is what even I was saying since then. You only wanted Rs.25,000 net. - Ok... don't get angry. Take it and go. Hey... hello... hello... we went to the shop to see you. But you weren't there. Why do you want to see? - Isn't there a scooty in your shop? Thought of buying it once I know its rate. For whom? - For her. She seems to be from a rich family. She can buy a new one. No one in her house likes her riding a scooty. That is why she is trying for a second hand. Hey... don't you know which bike to take? Are you new to this area or new to the job? Hey... I am asking you. Area and the job both are new. - Go. Hey... what is next? - Motilal Seth. It is about that mini van matter. Ok, you go there and come directly to Sukumar. Have you stolen? - Do I look like that? He is hitting and you are watching! Why? You should have hit. Is he looking like a humanbeing? I was dumb founded. Didn't you understand? Just go. Hey... where are you going? I am going to see the gentleman who gave that bike to me. Shall I also come? - No need. Hey, anyway you will hit the man who gave the bike. I am eager to see that. Can I come along? For the attention of U M finance. Without knowing what sort of finance is yours, I took loan from you. I will somehow repay you by selling the bike. Hey... now why did you come along with me? Bother, owner has gone out. You please wait for some time. Look, tell your owner that he should be here when I come. I should not take. Ok? I came fast knowing that you would come. Came quite fast! Go. You know that I am coming. Why did you hit the boy? What? Did I hit? Come. Ask the boy. Let him say that I hit him. I will cut myself. Hey... did I hit? Did I hit you? Did I hit? Owner, didn't you hear what the boy says? Boys won't lie. Go. A person from a middle class family... goes missing without any reason... what would we do at the most? We would complain. By complaining like that... and running to and fro to the station for 2 years... do you see what is the state of an ordinary middle class boy? Sir... - We are searching, Poovarasan. We will find him. You have been saying this for the past 2 years. Hey... what were you doing for the past 2 years? Brother, I am asking you normally. What were you doing for the past 2 years? I have been driving brother's call taxi for the past 2 years. What else do you expect me to do? Look Poovarasan, I have already told you clearly. As regards your brother's case and your family... there are no enemies. How else to find out? Someone who is not connected at all only must have done something. Sir, don't just say someone. Tell me who he is. What will you do, if I tell you? Will you kill him? If I come to know as to who he is, the pain will reduce. Is that all? You are asking too many questions. I didn't ask questions, sir. I just asked about my brother's case. It would take 5 years to find out even big people's case. You don't even have a background! Your case is almost like unclaimed body. We will just bury and keep going. Understood? - Sir, if someone dies in your family or goes missing, will you talk like this? Hey... don't be too good! You won't be able to live. - I am not a good person, sir. I am searching for a chance to make a mistake. Otherwise why would I come to you for the past 2 years and ask. Greetings! - Greetings! Greetings. Greetings Kadiresan. - Come. Yes Vadivu Brother wished to be a member of your party and so I brought him. It is good, Vadivu. We can make him a member. Brother, give Rs.300. Give. - Fill this also. Hope he knows to write. Brother, I have a problem. You tell me that you can solve it. Then I will pay the money. Vadivu, take him aside. He will talk. Is it? Ok, come. Go. Poovarasan, you should be patient there, ok? Come. Greetings, brother. - Greetings. Greetings. He is my brother, he is our boy. Let him in. What Vadivu, what is the problem? Brother, his name is Poovarasan. Sir, brother went missing 2 years back. You need not find him... just want to know if he is alive or not. Can you do it? - Which place do you belong to? You are asking if it is possible? What Vadivu, won't you tell him before you bring him? No, I did tell him. Still he wanted to see you in person and talk. Here there are different procedures to move each and every case. You don't know if your brother went missing or died, isn't it? Hey Kadiresa... - Brother... Take him and tell him about the amount. Go. - Come. Vadivu, is he from our ward? He is from our ward. We are using him for some urgent work. He is little wealthy. Ok, then go and see. - Ok. Your name? - Poovarasan. What 'belt'? Hey what is this?♪♪♪♪ I asked your name and you said. This is also like that. Tell... what 'belt'? Leather belt. Whom have you brought! Hey... Poovarasan... you should not go away like this. If boss comes to know it will be bad. Come in. - No. Come, let us talk. - This won't work. If they ask about caste you should have told. Hey... what do you want me to say? You said he would come running to help. I don't find any difference between police and him. Listen to me. - No. Nothing will happen. That too if it is for me, nothing will work. Move. What happened? Asked to settle Rs.25 lakhs you say you are not in the area and ask them to come here and there and make them run around. If you come, I will kill you. Don't do anything outside. Brother is not making money these days. Brother is not making money. So I am making. You will just go in a Scorpio with a flag in the front with pride. One day or the other you will be caught. I wanted to insult you. Now aren't you caught. Nepoleon... you are making a mistake. Now what do you want? You want the money given by Rudran, isn't it? You are getting beaten for that. Go... run and get it. Hey... Sukumar... didn't you hear? I asked you to run. Go... run. You had it and should have given it. Why do you make me run around? Go. - You leave. Hey... I am asking you to go. This is U M Group. Now it will not prosper at all. I have to go to another party, immediately. Brother, SI and Hriday have come. They are waiting for you. What about Sukumar? Did the amount come? It has come. - Did you insult him? Yes. - Did everyone laugh? No. They all felt happy! You talk and see... if it doesn't work out then kill him. If you miss then I am finished. Greetings, sir. - What does he say? He says it was taken by his father and why should he pay? Is he married? - No. But there is a girl in his house. Then kidnap her. - Brother... he is not that attached to her. We will make it happen. Brother... Madhiazagan has changed the gun. Hey... get up. Get up. Sir is asking you to come in. Your father pledged the house you are staying in, for Rs.40 lakhs. Sorry, your father is no more. What shall we do? Tell. Do you have any slip that you have given Rs.40 lakhs? Now the property is in my name. If you show me a proof that you have given, I will give it. Madhiazhagan... - Sir... the boy is asking for proof! Sir, you do something. I have told him but he doesn't listen. Don't you know that you shouldn't have anything when you come in? Now the boys are going to molest her. You call me and cheat me? I won't leave you without killing. You do anything. But you can't take the property from me. Shut up. Give it. Arunachalam... - Sign. Sign. The girl is crying. Sign. Sign. Madhiazagan... Don't be selfish. The proof is ready. Take him. I am asking you to leave. Go. Hey... why did you give him a loaded gun? No sir... for safety sake... For whose safety? Go. Get out. Thanks. You don't like him. In fact don't like him at all. But he is earning well. Hey... even now I like only you. Hey... go. I will call you whenever I remember you. You talk. - No need. Atleast from now don't betray anyone. Who? Me? You refuse to go and take any job when I ask you to. Hey... that is the limit. Everything is finished. Nothing is over. Even now you say that you will leave it and come... I will stay with you. For me, he is more important than you. He is the one who is feeding me ever since I came to Chennai. I can't come just like that. That I already know. But I was scared that I will spend my whole life here, giving away old clothes. That is why I agreed when my family asked me. Hey... will you kiss me once? Like the way you would. Enough! Whenever you feel that I will be horrible without you... you call me. Take. - Mother... suppose he comes here, he shouldn't come here again... shouldn't call me... shouldn't follow me... tell him that I said this in anger. Ok? - Take... 'is it a dream of love' A special ring tone for him! Hey Mridula... - Why are you wasting the diesel? I came to see you. I should get angry. Why aren't you answering my phone? Who should pay rent for whose house? Who should pay the dues for whose vehicle? You can't come at the correct time when called. If I come late by 10 minutes, you can't talk nicely, isn't it? Look, we are not yet married. It won't be good if you stand here on the road and argue. Ok? You go. I have to go to the school. Madam... They wll come home for verification in 2 days. Ok, madam. - They will call before coming. When should I come? - It will come home. Ok, madam. What is your name? - Anita, madam. Original certificate, madam. Hi! - Hi! Did you come to renew? No, I am applying only now. I think there is some connection between you and me! Take. - No chance at all. How do you say? - Please wait. Thank you... when we meet some people in our life... it feels like that. The boys won't feel like that isn't it? Hey... actually what are you doing? I... I desired to go round the world. It is 10 years since I took this passport. So far I have not used it. Then surely there is some connection between you and me. How? - You wished to go round the world. I wished to go round my own town. Then why did you come here? You should have stayed there itself. I need money isn't it? That is why I came. But here too I couldn't lead a life that I wished. What to do? We are middle class! We should never lead a life we wished. That is called middle class! Brother, haven't you applied? Leave. See, we couldn't even talk. Meera, come. Are you happy? Give me the 10th mark sheet. - It is there in that, madam. For whom are you waiting? Is anyone coming? A girl from Palayamkottai has come to the passport office. I am waiting for her. Have you travelled with girls? No. - Why? I have not yet met a girl whom I liked. I have met just now. Have you ever travelled with boys? Yes, I have. But there is no one whom I can remember. Oh... are you ok if some boy from your town loves you? I won't like if they love, but I like my town boys. Yes...! Tell me uncle. - Look at this... how many years have gone by? Can you be like this? Tell... can you stay like this without getting married for 10 years? 'for you' It is not like that uncle. Even we are searching. You say the same thing whenever asked. We are doing whatever is possible, uncle. You are doing. We are also watching. After making all the conveniences... he has handed over the car and gone. You people are also living happily. Father, don't talk unnecessarily. Is he destined to drive this car? Just enquire and keep quiet. Sister in law, he is talking in anger... you don't get angry. - You keep quiet Poovarasan. He is your brother and he is my husband. Why should he show more concern than us? You go. Go father. Do you know why phone was discovered? There is problem at home. That is why I didn't reply. Now I have come. Come. First, are you true to anyone? I am not true to anyone. Will you come and sit in the car? Hey... Mridula... hey... shouldn't I talk to you jokingly? Why joke? I called you and you didn't answer. You should ask as to why I called. Don't get angry. Now I am asking. Why did you call? That party man called you again. You didn't reply. Why did he call? Our car which was standing when brother went missing... today an accident took place in that same spot. Who are you? Is it your relative? Then why are you standing? Come on, go. Hey I am asking you to go. Go. Greetings to everyone. They start a group... 10 of you will join that. In few days ten of you will fight. Isn't a problem created in the family? All that is not there here. We give separately for each and everyone. Understood? Didn't understand. Now think that I form a group. You can come personally to me whenever you want. This branch is mine. I am going to take care of it. This branch... If I say this branch is mine doesn't mean it is fully mine. We will do only that which Rudramurthy sir says. Rudran... the boy Hridayan from whom you took the signature... I think he has gone to Babu Jain. Now the case has gone beyond Nolambur station and has gone to commissioner's office. Do something good for him. I have just done it Karuppaiya. What else? - What else...? I am planning to keep 3 kg. Gold in Babu Jain's locker. Do you want to say something? - Now I am in a meeting DC. Oh is it so? Good! Idiot. Didn't I ask you not to cross me and go... did you listen? Quietly go and fall at that man's feet. Otherwise for her it was Ambattur Bridge... don't know what Bridge is for you. What is it Madhi... Are the ones, who did the accident, new boys? Why? They have taken the car over the leg, sir. What are you saying? - Tell your boys, sir. That doctor will torture me. Sir, what about the interest? It is nothing much. How do you pay when you are in a group? If I borrow Rs.50,000 I will pay Rs.6,500 per month. It will get over in 10 months. Yes, it is the same here also. If you pay for 10 months there... here you are going to pay for 15 months, that's all. 50,000...? - Yes, 50,000. Then what? Will you give whenever we ask? Yes, you will call at midnight... do I have to come here and sleep at night? 10 to 6 that's all. Where is Napoleon? Brother Madhi had called. He has gone to give money to mortuary doctor. It is a mistake. What have you done? You carry a girl... 'eat' extremely! I am not saying it is wrong. Because I am not in a stage where I can justify things. But eating like this and throwing it on the road... they will identify whether 2 wheeler or a car or a lorry went over. It is shameful! No... - If Robert was around... he would have done it sharply! No one is like him. It seems a new person has to be created! Is there any problem here? You left the function half way through. There is no problem here. You are a problem. You joined me 8 years ago. I thought you would be the same even now. The heart didn't ache but you hurt me. I...? No. No Rudran... it is not so. Hey... what did you tell brother? You had only said. My branch... it is me... it is wrong Arunachalam. I didn't mean it that way, Rudran. Arunachalam, you and I don't have blood relations. There is no need for that here. What is this Rudran, you are talking as if you are talking to the boys? Hey... as per me all of you are boys. You go, I will get it. Didn't I say while coming in, that we have to buy you also a dress? For that, even you have to open your purse a bit. Come. Take this. - Shall we leave? Ok grandfather. Madam 950. Is this the way you search your brother? Who asked him to buy the car? Wasn't he going around carrying medicines? He could have settled in a medical shop. If only you have earned Rs.10,000 per month and given it to us he too would have settled down by opening a medical shop. So I am responsible for that also? Yes, you are the reason. Who else? Now if I find him and make him stand before you, it is ok isn't it? You... will find! If you find him... I will die. Hey... you bring my son and make him stand in front of me... I will commit suicide. So you think I have not done anything till now. Here... you are doing! I am watching! Who says that you are not doing anything? You take her and go. Come. Listen, you go to your house. I will ask my mother to come and talk to your father. Everything will be fine, if your brother comes. Who he? Hope he doesn't come. He likes if I am troubled. That is why he ran away. Now will you go home or not? - Aunty, sorry aunty. I had only cried. How do you know that I am your aunt? My uncle would show your photo on the phone and say you are my aunt. I know that Poovarasan is in love. Sister in law... But didn't know that he would be caught by his father. What are you doing? - I am working in a school. It is ok even if Poovarasan doesn't earn money. But don't ask him to drive call taxi. Uncle... Hey... go. Father, daughter in law is not feeding properly. She feeds well. She is feeding you first and you eat happily. Ok, bye. Hey... give me money. - I have kept it inside. Don't lie. - You won't listen. Hey, father need not know. Listen... What does the baby say? Bye...! He took the car happily like this for work... it has been 2 years... he has not returned at all. We molest a girl courageously. Do we leave at that...? We destroy his family. Isn't he the affected party. How much anger he should get? It is ok even if there is no reaction. He comes and works with us only. Hridaya, why do you come inside this? Do you have any other plan? Everything is over. What else? - It is their daughter's wedding... Greetings, sir. She found it difficult to get Rs.5 lakhs. That is why I came. Are you her mediator? - No. I tried everywhere, sir. Everyone is saying that there is no income in IT... no one is giving money. You have to do a favour. Hey... Arunachalam, give. What else do you expect? 5 L? - Tell... I will do. Nothing. One hour before tying the nuptial chain you have to pay. We will give, sir... we will surely give. Do I have to sign... My brother has said. You go. - Ok. Don't give trusting me. Now I don't have any property. Suppose they don't give, then what do I do? This is how Robert came saying that your father needed money. I gave money at this same place without taking any proof. Atleast now you understand. Brother, I feel like staying with you. Why? - I am living alone. I can live with someone's background. Ok. Hey... - Go... Give my document. Take this. After giving 15 lakhs, you are asking for document! It is my mistake to let you run this shop. I run this shop and give you this 15 lakhs. Then can I steal and give? Give me that document. I will pledge it in a bank and do full settlement. Then why did you take the money from me? You could have taken it from the bank at the beginning itself. At that time there was no IT. Now we have got it ready. I think Babu Jain is behind this. So what if whoever is there? You have got the money... leave. You made me come in person. Napoleon... What... Now you have to beg in this same place. In 10 minutes time you should have Rs.10 in your plate. Or else you are gone. Won't you shout? Shout...! Sister, Rudran is creating problem. Hey... sit... Shout... ask them to give you alms. Madam... mother... Whose car is standing on the right? Move it. It is standing on the road. Why have you got down and doing this? Mother... madam... Hey... what? - Alms... Go... I will pay the rent myself. Leave him sir. How selfish you are! Hey umpire, why are you troubling him? Why? Why should I not trouble him? Why do you bother? - He desires to live. Come. I won't trouble you. I will just ask you one question. You answer only that. A person is destroying your property and family itself. How can you work for him? You reply only to this. - Umpire... I am asking you to come. How many people are there in your house. Mother and myself... why? - After your mother dies... if this question is stuck to you, come and ask. I will tell. Tell. I asked Arunachalam to deal this Adi matter. Has the boy done anything? Just find out. - Which boy? He is that Hridayam. When will you give? The apartments built in Sengalpattu has not yet been sold. What do you want me to do? Adi, the flat that you have built is Rs.40 lakhs. The money that I gave you is just Rs.4 lakhs. Is there any connection between the two? The money has not come, if it had come wouldn't I have given? You say money hasn't come but you've started the work on new building. Where did you get money for this? Hey why do you come and create a scene? Father is giving you interest properly. Only the principle has to be given. Move... go. Keep quiet, father. - Listen to me. Hey your father couldn't settle the money on the said date. No sir. - Then the sound will be loud. You should be silent. Go. Father, they are hitting. Adi, the amount should come tomorrow. If not your son will come home with one hand. Father... - Come. Take... settle the hospital bill with this amount. I told you that I will sell the flat and give you the money. Why did you cut my son's hand before that? There is something called time, Adi. That is everything for us. If you had settled the amount on the said date... would such a thing have happened? If we can't do anything to you... you will do whatever you want? Adi, because you knew that we will do whatever we want... you couldn't do anything. Hey... now what are you going to do about his hand? Hey... first settle the amount that you borrowed! Then the hand will grow on its own. Why do you give amount to these people? Stop with this. Ok. Switch off the mobile and give the hand bag. Have you collected from Swami? - Yes. Why didn't you collect money last month from Santhanabharathi? He has gone to his home town because his father died. Collect it before he dies. Go. Good morning, sir. I want to pledge the document. - Which area? Anna Nagar. - Is it for business or for personal? It is for business. Please check it. Come between 1st to 10th. Go. Stop. Hey... I have to see him, sir. He will not see those who don't pay interest. Napoleon, I have come in dispair. Don't irritate me. Go. He gave because you said. Tomorrow he will ask me. Brother, we will go and hit them and collect. Do something. Napoleon, he had brought a party. Today is the settlement. It has not yet come. Come, let us go. Wait. This, I borrowed from you. This, you gave for my son's hospital expenses. Rudra... in everyone's life there would be a day when they would've got insulted. That will be through me. Hit... what are you talking and to whom? Hridaya... Hey... go. Why did you remain like that? The one who cut the hand should catch the neck? Brother, you have kept people who are affected by us. He is doing the things which I am supposed to do. Is this a problem for you? It is not a problem. When you call Hridayan, it pains within me. Hey... isn't it her marriage today? Is this causing more pain than that? Brother, you are with me. Then how will it pain? Only this pains. Hey... we are talking. Go. Brother, shouldn't there be a marriage in our life? Ok, leave me. I don't want. But you...? Don't you need a girl to look after you? Why? Won't you look after? I will take care of you. But don't you need a marriage? Hey... what is there in it? We ourselves keep a security for ourselves... and is it necessary for a separate person to follow us? Then do you say that you don't want to marry at all? All the relationships are like use and throw. Use them so long as they are there. If not, throw away. Brother, why do you stay alone without anyone being there for you? When you are alone when no one is around... we have a freedom for ourselves. You feel that. You are the hero. So if we do this business... then we have to see all the human beings like cattles. We have to feed them so long as they are needed. If we don't need them, we should cut them and eat and keep going. Isn't it? You have said it correctly. But change it a bit. Have you noticed one thing? None of these cattles will see who feeds them. It will only see what they get. Because for them food is the target. People are also like that. Even for them food is the target. So for that they add love, affection wherever and whenever. This cattle relationship is enough for me. I can't live like you. Why? - Because I am not a cattle. For me the person who feeds and what he feeds both are important. Bye. All the relationships are like use and throw. Use so long as they are there. If they are not there, throw away. Hey... how many times have I told you... not to dress up the way I like in the morning itself. All the things that are not used will become old... and one won't like to look at it, is what my grandmother said. Why are you with me? - I think I like you. For how many days will you be with me? Till you get bored. I am feeling bored now itself. What will you do? - Then I will have to go. Leave. - Don't get angry. He will come to me and plead. You don't take pity on him. Tell mother. You would always deposit money on the 1st itself. Have you forgotten? No, the money is in my hand. I will put it in the account and tell you. Go and take. Ok, be careful. Sir, wait for an hour after the nuptial chain is tied I will get gift money and I will return the money. Hey... what did you say when you borrowed? Didn't I say you have to give the money one hour before tying the nuptial chain? Even now I am saying the same thing. I am asking you to wait for an hour. Am I asking you to wait for a day? You please sit. Brother... you please tell him. While borrowing you forcibly took me and got the money. While giving you can give without insulting me. Go and bring. Sir, wait for a while. I will arrange and give. We can talk it out. Don't. I am telling. I am saying we will talk it out. For that you will hit me only? Hey... we asked you to get and you are standing! Hit... - Napoleon why do you do like this? He is my man. Brother, come. Come. Hey... come. We are doing this marriage as she likes him a lot. You don't create any problem. I know. I came without realising. You come and sit. I will arrange and give. You take it and go. Don't. - Oh come. Come, come and sit. Come. Hey... your man has come. 'I am not a chaste person' 'I am not the one who was born for you' 'even if I vanish' 'even if it is the next birth' 'don't go beyond me' 'I need you' 'even if I lose I will be there for you' 'even if I am dead or forgotten I will deny for you' 'even if I am lying down, don't cross me and go' 'I need you' 'don't go beyond me' 'I need you' 'to talk affectionately and with love there are no girls' 'everyday we didn't embrace' 'to love with eyes there is no mercy' 'don't have patience to talk to you and separate' 'follow me, come as a companion' 'to celebrate presumptuously' 'come measured, come contained' 'to stay daily' 'eventhough it is for me' 'though you go separate' 'we have lost because of our own self so you and I' 'will separate, you were not the one who had only friendship' 'I am not the one who was born for you' 'even if I vanish or if it is the new birth' 'don't go beyond me' 'I need you' 'even I didn't live with you in dream' 'you didn't sleep with me at night' For me he is more important than you. 'don't need' 'so did't start a new path' 'to embrace or to forget' 'love's arrow' 'will laugh will get thrilled ' 'to unite once again' 'if only for this' What? - I told you... that a person loved me one sided. He is the one. - Oh is it so? 'you and I' Uncle that sister is calling you. 'didn't stay with friendship' 'I was not...' In front of a good person, love is nothing. 'even if I live for you' 'I need you' Brother, I have given the amount to uncle... take it. Brother... thank you very much. This wouldn't have happened without you. Hey, why did you hit him like this? Go. That Sukumaran, who settled our dues... he is again creating problem with our party. I think he doesn't know my value. How much we have done for him. We have to do something very bad. Brother, let us not do anything in his area. We will take him out. Ok, take the boys. - Ok. I like him a lot. Otherwise I am not over enthusiastic. I know. Go. Hey... catch... - Tie. Sukumar, such a thing has happened with many people. I have myself done it for you. But brother would do it for me... You didn't expect that brother would do this for you so soon isn't it? Planning! I know. Hey... we all will always remember where we are. But we often forget who we are. Henceforth both of us will remember. Ok? Hey Hridayam, come and collect him. What Napoleon... is it paining a lot? Tell brother, that I have not made any mistake. You don't have an identity. You did the finance properly. You were everything to me. I thought you would be ahead of me as regards girls. Hey, you know she is not for you... then why does she need a man for herself? Brother, don't talk about her like this. Hey... I had planned to help you... and gave her father the money... but you go there and hit the boys. You have misunderstood me. You are feeling for the girl who left you. What will you do for this Utharan? I will give my life. Hey... what Napoleon... vengence? If I give you a reason for this it will not be good. You go. What are you doing? - He has stuck it with gum. He is true to me and making mistakes. You are staying with me and acting? It is your face. Can it get scratched? Hey... - Don't feel too much, go. Leave me. Atleast now you decide that you don't need anyone in your life. After that start finance. What are you saying? - 50 lakhs Ujwala. Ambattur branch amount has to be transferred to Avadi Sukumar. Ok, I will search. Search quickly. - Is there any problem there? I had kept it in the locker room. Did anyone come after I left? No... no one came. Did anyone come in my absence? Who can come here when you and I are not there? Someone would come in search of you. What is this you are talking in a different way. I am very tensed. Are you very tensed? Yes. - Too much? I am breathless. You just come out of that locker room... and close the eyes. I have come. - Lean back. I have leaned. I got scared. Now. - No. During such times you should not get scared. Ok, you should also play something. I will come at night. I can't. I need now itself. Sometimes, for some things, one has to wait. That is happiness. You played because you liked it. Then what? Come. Come. - Utharan asked me to give this. That is why I came. Otherwise you wouldn't have come, isn't it? No, I have never seen you with Utharan. You are new. That is why I said like this. That is Utharan's 'plus'! No one knows who, where and when someone was with him! But he will use when it is needed. You are the only one who has understood Utharan. He is a person who is guided by his own understanding. When asked or seen he will do what he feels like and keep moving. How do you say? You and I are together for so many years. Till today, beyond him... about his family or his background... do you and I know any details? We are not UM Finance owners. We are just like helpers. That's all. Ok, forget that. Let us not talk about him. Shall I do something good for you? For what? Because I beat Napoleon? Why do you see you and me differently? If you want to do something good for me... see to it that he doesn't come to the top. Hey... so much has happened. Will Utharan call him again? He will call. You and I have a problem. If Utharan decides that he should not antagonise you and me... he will surely call him. How many years have you been with him? It has been more than 5 years. That is why this sole leadership. Because of that one should not be with him without knowing him. Sukumar... are you pin pointing that I am with him for so many years without knowing anything about him? Because you don't know anything about him you are with him for so many years. Go. Greetings, sir. Tell brother Babu that I have come. Hey first say who you are, from where have you come... for what have you come... tell me everything. I have to go in and tell. If I tell everything to you... then why should I see Babu Jain? Go... go and say Napoleon has come. Sir Napoleon... - Ask him to come, you go. Ok, sir. Bala, sir is calling him in. Brother go. What Napoleon, how is your hand? - It is ok. Do you need money? - No. Then why have you come this side? A commercial property in Anna Nagar area... worth 1 crore. I have told the party 50 lakhs and have said they should pay us 5%. You take whatever you want and give the remaining. You know everything about our business, Napoleon. Give me little time. Why brother Babu? - You are the life of Utharan. Nothing should go wrong. Will you chase your boys away without any reason? I don't have that kind of habit. Without doing a mistake I will not chase away anyone. Then you say I made a mistake? - You didn't do a mistake Napoleon. But it was Utharan who created you. Tell me if I can pamper you and take work out of you? You don't have to pamper me. I will get you business. You do it for me. - I will think Napoleon. Will you think or will you talk to him and tell me? Why do you have to know all that? I will finalise it for you in the next meeting. Go. Then, how do you wish to lead your life? How to lead... for a long time my mother wanted a concrete house in the village. I have to build a house for her. I need a small car for me. Earn well till the age of 40 years and settle down in the village. Is that all? Yes. - I don't like this love and all. Not only that I don't have faith in the marriage. How to say... I want to travel for life. What about you? Hey... it is ok. Leave it. Let's go. No. You go. Hey... you drop me. Are you trying to irritate me? When I came to Chennai in the beginning... I bought an appam and when asked to pay money for the sambhar separately I went to kill him. I am getting angry... I can't be shamless like you. I will just go and tell. Ok. Has Ramakrishnan taken the Pulsar? He said he will come in the evening. What? - Meera says... that she wants to top up her mobile. Brother, top up Rs.300 to Airtel. Hey... he has done it! - Has he? It is a mistake. Meera says, she wants to go out... you have to fill the tank. Fill the tank. - Check the zero. The tank is full. Go. Hey... the petrol tank is already full! Hey why didn't you say it earlier? You didn't ask at all. - I will hit. Meera... Everything was over that day itself. What else? You had applied for the passport, isn't it? I came to ask if it had come. What are you going to do by knowing that? No, it is said that if one has to travel with someone... one has to know fully about that person. Who said? - My father. I had told you that day itself. Ok? This travelling... to be in touch... to connect... don't come to me for all this. Will you be married to me till the end? Tell me, why passport, we can talk about personal life also. Tell me, can you do it? You can't, isn't it? Come on, go. Take her away. Why are you still standing here? - Hey come. Whose daughter are you trying to hit? What are you doing here? Scooty was on sale and I came to know its price. Hey... won't you say the price when asked? That is what I was saying. How... will you raise your hand and tell the price? I have told you not to ride 2 wheeler. Then why do you wish to have it. Go and sit in the car. Go. Hey... if I see you again with my daughter... I will thrash you. Go. Which town? - Playankkottai. Is that why you are arrogant? It is not being arrogant. They came and asked me the price of scooty. I said Rs.20,000. She said give it for Rs.2,000 or else she will get the shop shut. I have to see Hridayam. Go. Name? - Vasan. Tell the number. - 989148403. Go straight and turn left. Hridayam. - Sit. Who are you? What are you doing? I have a shop. - What shop? Second hand bike sales. - Where? Rajaji Street. If it is Rajaji Street then there is provision store opposite to it. Where from the provision store? - There to the left. To the left is the fruit shop. Where is your shop? It is directly opposite to it, sir. If it is opposite then it is Pachchayappa store. Yes that is the one. It is that shop. Ok, give me your license. Sign at the right side corner till the bond paper gets over. Hey, have you brought the scooty? I have come. Ask him to come. It is standing below. Take it. Sir, this down payment... I will come to the shop. You go. Does Napoleon have so much respect here? No one has respect here. Don't you have a shop? The respect is for your shop, go. Ok sir. Bye. Hey move. Hey... who is he? - Pachchayappa has referred him. Is it so! - He has a shop in his building. Ask him if he knows to ride the scooty. He has fallen down. Why we have not yet got the interest amount from Adi? Adi has joined Babu Jain. - Is it so? Yes... didn't we hit him? At that time itself Babu Jain has taken him over. What difference does it make to me who takes over Adi? Why the amount has not yet been collected? No, wanted to ask you and then collect. Don't get used to give excuses. You will go missing. Hridayam, ask Arunachalam to kill Adi. Yes, I will tell. The Airtel number you are calling... I am giving so many details... he is getting angry at me. What is the point in giving details. You couldn't take the decision. What decision has to be taken? Either you should have killed the person or collected the amount. You didn't do either. My father has no brain. Why does he take the new scooty from him? That you have to ask him. Hey... see he has done a 'comedy'. Stupid. Key... give the key. Give. Hey... don't you have brain? I have bought a new scooty, prayed to God and garlanded it... you are throwing it. Hey... what... creating a scene? I know what has to be done to my scooty. Come, let's go. You came in search of me to buy scooty because she is loving you? She won't be a good match for you. Don't waste your time by running after her. Stick a photo behind the vehicle saying brother is missing... and write your number. Who is there to find out like that? Then you won't listen if I tell you. Now shall I wipe the car or not? Hey... if you can't then tell me. - I can't. Do whatever you can. You are here for so many years. Is there even a single person here for you? Hey... is this our town? - You know, isn't it? Then we have to keep quiet. Then on your own you won't do anything. You are saying I don't do anything. I can do only if I know who it is. Why are you killing me? Sweta... what is this? - Spider... monkey. Very good! From tomorrow, when you get this, get two more. Why? - Tiffin, lunch, dinner. Will you come and stay in my house? Of late no one in my house is affectionate towards me. Is there a problem again? He was driving day and night saying he has to pay due for the car. It seems he would have paid. I can't drive day and night. If you want more money than this, you go and drive. We behave nicely. People do all sorts of things. Why nothing good is happening to us? It is all the curse of my brother. When my brother was here he used to scold me as I didn't go for work. I would keep telling him not to scold me. He will be shouting. I will break something in anger and go away. He can't bear even for one hour. He will call me and ask me where I am and ask me to come home. Brother... Where are you? - We have crossed Anna Nagar circle. Give the phone to the driver. - One minute. Brother, he is giving the address. Will you please note it? Sir... - Take right from the signal. Ok sir, after that... Keep looking to the left, there will be a road inside. You drop her there and keep going. Sir... In case you are asked to pick up again... tell her that you have a personal work and keep going. Truly I have my personal work, sir. Are you coming or not? - I am on my way. Why do you always make me cry? I will be home in 5 minutes, Mridula. How many 5 minutes, how many 10 minutes? You need not come. - Can't you wait for 10 minutes? I can't... I can't wait. You will have a small pick up. You go. Sorry. - It's ok. Sir I have come. Where are you? I have seen you. Here. They want land in acres. Who has got? Look, like you say to breed emus you don't need land in acres. Our terrace is enough. - So you say that we can go ahead? Yes. Muruga... vehicle, emu, set, money. I will see everything! See, he gave the advance yesterday. Today he has begun the work! Is it so? Tell Poovarasan... Brother, a person who hit Sukumar that day... Yes. - You too said he is Utharan's man Yes. - Who is Utharan? Who is Utharan? He is the biggest financier in the city. If he is not there, the middle class can't survive at all. Finance means... what sort of finance? If you ask for Rs.100 he will give you Rs.150... make you run for not able to pay the balance Rs.50... and earning Rs.500 is what his business is! Will he give finance for the car? I am saying that he will give for bed, won't he give for the car? In case you are asked to pickup again... say you've personal work and keep going. Hey... did you call the driver? You had only asked me to switch off the phone. Hello... sir is it control room? - Yes. Place? Anna Nagar... Hey... who are you? I have not come here to fight with you. Then... you will carry and go? It isn't like that, sir. Then why did you come? Do you know who I am? I don't know sir... but I know I can't do anything to you. How do you know? - You have a lot of background! Leave her. Sir, the original document... Hey... go. You will get your money. Sir, don't do anything to me by keeping this in mind, sir. Respect! 'in the dream of love, won't leave your hand...' 'in the dream of love, your...' Answer the phone. - No. Mridula... - How many times will you call? If you call again, I will break the phone. Hey... don't talk like an idiot, Mridula. I didn't even come for my birthday. If I am not there with you on those good moments also... did you think that I would be having some problems. Aren't you alive? Hope you aren't dead. Put the phone down. Hey... come out. Aunty... please aunty. Please aunty. Happy Birthday to me! Won't you call? Hey... come out and see! They are burning the car! Oh...! Oh...! Come, Mridula. Wait...! What? - Nothing. Do you know what this is? - Chain. Oh no... this... - Poovarasan... Mridula! This is wife, this is wife. How is it? Greetings...! Again you have come this side! No, Sitaraman. I had a lot of respect in that party. Now is it not there? He has found out. The reason to come to your party is not because I like you or your boss. Somehow I have to become a member in the 83rd Ward. Our leader's birthday is coming. At that time try to join the party. Won't you bring about 10 people along? Why are you asking like that? Everyone around 5 km. Know who Vadivu is. Everyone knows you, Vadivu. If you call will they come? Will they come if I call? Don't talk without knowing the background. It is 30 years since I have come. If I move my finger people will stand behind me. See he has come! What Poovarasan... is it drop? No, pick up. He is our boy. - Is it so? He will do anything for me. Don't believe him. I won't do anything for him. Then Poovarasan, have you eaten? If not will you feed me? He is talking sarcastically. Myself and his family are extremely close! He will always talk like this jokingly! Not only he, the entire area is like this. He is lying. - Then... you have created a good party. Is it any ordinary matter, Vadivu? Greetings. Bye. Created a party. There is only problem in every town. Go carefully. Come early tomorrow. - Ok, bye. Hey... - Mother is there upstairs! What are you doing? - Just like that. How long are you going to be like this? Mridula... Take me to your father and we can discuss marriage. Yes you can talk. No, I still have to go and buy. Why are you pulling a long face and coming? I can take her to him and make her talk... unnecessarily he will be constantly saying brother is missing. My father... - Don't give excuses. You can't isn't it? Hey, why are you getting angry now? Somehow we will move on to the next stage in life. We can tell at that time. What is there like a next stage? Still giving birth to a child is remaining. You can do that now itself. There is no need for a marriage. Is there a route like that! Then shall we go directly? You all are not human beings. Animals. Why did you hit? Then what do you want me to do? You are talking like a loafer. I asked you to wait. I can't wait for you anymore. I want a decision now. Father, I will bring that girl. Will you talk? Go and bring her. We can talk. Go. Father, Mridula's mother. Which is your family deity? - There is no special family deity. But we pray Thandoneeswarar. For us it is Sudalai madan. It won't suit you, isn't it? Father. - No, not used to it. The girl is good looking. You have found a good match for yourself. But it won't fit our family. Father, you said you liked her and asked me to bring them. Now why do you talk unnecessarily. Hey, I am not talking unnecessarily. I thought you will bring someone from our caste. Look father, don't talk nonsense. That's the respect you will get. Leave it. I will take care of my life myself. Even now what you do? You only take care of your life. You are talking as if you are doing something new. Has brought. You wait in the car. Won't you like if I am happy? Should be crying looking at the sky... saying brother went missing. Then you will be happy. Do you want me to live or go missing like him? Shouldn't I have a life? You have lived happily. My mother should have been there. If she was there would she have chased me like this? Did you see how he is talking? Uncle, if he likes, let him lead his life. Let him lead a life, did I say no? Did you see whom he has brought? Searching for the one who is lost, don't lose the one who is there. Somehow he will come. Let him come and say let the brother lead his life... then let him do whatever he wants. Why should I bother? Then if he doesn't return what will you do, uncle? You too believe only that? If a person doesn't come home even after so many days... one has to believe. Then, if a man doesn't come home... does it mean that he is dead? Uncle, if he doesn't come home on the first day, we can search. If he doesn't return on the 2nd day, we can give a complaint. If a person doesn't come home for the past 2 years... one can only say that he is no more. I am asking you to wait. Don't I know about that man? If you just say this man, that man you won't get any respect, go. Go and get lost. Hello... Poovarasan, your father has met with an accident. Father. 'come... son you come' 'son you come' 'can't forget, you come' 'I am tired of crying' 'the town is talking, it is all over' Hey brother, bring the money. Brother, it is not yet 1st. So you won't pay the due? Give me two day's time. Brother, for the first due itself you are creating problem. I will come back. Keep the money. Where are you? - Why are you asking? No, I have to see you. Then shall we meet at the Mall? I want to ask you a few things openly. Interesting! Ask. I always think about you. I myself feel as if I am very close to you. Isn't that wrong? Surely it is wrong. I think you have a fascination for my structure. This is not a big problem. If you start moving with someone better than me... this will automatically go. You said you don't have faith in marriage. Then don't you have trust in men? I have a lot of trust in men. But the one who comes as a husband... I don't have trust in him at all. Didn't understand. - One day, late night... I come home totally drunk. Then what will you do? I will punch the face. You will punch, isn't it? Suppose you drink and come... can I punch you? I won't drink at all. Oh... is it so! Ok, you go to your girl friend's birthday party. Hey stop... I don't have a girl friend. Why do you think about a person who is not there? Now you don't have. What if you have one after marriage? What do you say... that we are not a perfect match. Isn't it? - Not between you and me... if a girl thinks like this, she won't be a perfect match to anyone. Where will your father be? - He will be at home. Why do you ask? I want to ask him why he has kept such a brilliant girl here. That is why. You go. You go and be free. Block him. Hey, I had warned you that day itself. Then why did you buy her the scooty? No uncle... - What...? You bought her so that she will love you? Hey... not only you... she won't love anyone. How do you know that? I am with her for the past 25 years. Won't I know? Uncle, will you help me? It would be better if you pay this scooty's due. I will take care. You go. Then you tell your daughter... not to move around in a friendly way with boys like me. Why? - No uncle... we immediately fix that this is the girl. But when she says that she wants to keep travelling... there is a kind of tension. Why is 'sir' getting tensed? Then you won't see any girl in your life! No uncle, that... Adi, I am telling and you are raising your hand. Adi, just now I gave it to Sukumar. He said he'll give the amount tonight. Come and collect it. What if you die? - What? What if you die at night? You... - I told you I will give at night. Adi... this is our party. Don't raise your hand. Hey... that's it. Who are you? Who...? Adi, you have settled only the loan that you have taken. Interest amount of Rs.75,000 is still remaining. Give that and move out of this place. Hey Vanangamudi, isn't it an insult to you. If only you had paid the monthly due regularly... you could have taken the loan from us. Leave it, I will sell the shop and settle both of them. What? First you settle my money. Then someone would have opened a finance shop in a dirty lane... give him. What did you say? - What did I say? First settle the amount. - No... no. Now you said something. I said he is doing financing in a dirty lane. Brother, Vanangamudi has made a mistake. Why? He has taken finance from Babu Jain also. Adi and his boys had come for collection. What has to be done now for that? That is why I called you. Arunachalam, Sukumar are in that area only. Ok, I will call and talk to them. Tell. - I had called brother. Brother spoke just now. I will bring Sukumar along. Sir. Brother, tell me. Hridayan, you gave a scooter to that bike shop boy... Yes. - That I will settle. Henceforth there is no need to go to that boy for collection. Ok, I will tell the boys. What is it? Umpire had gone for collection and someone has hit him. Who is he? Which area? Who is the one? - Adi. I didn't take the gun as I was going for collectiion. You... did you tell Utharan that you got hit? Don't go in front of Utharan. Napoleon, Adi has hit umpire. The elder one is going ahead. This is a chance for you. You go and kill Adi. I will tell brother that Napoleon had done it and you will come in. I will come in and do what? He will call my name Napoleon aloud. I will have to go and stand. Isn't that all? Don't think like that. Even now your place is vacant. If you come, it is good. Hey... why are you so concerned about me? You want to know who killed the one who was with you, isn't it? She was not with me at all. Then who was it? What are you going to do knowing it? Hey... none of those who sat on this bike are alive. Other than the two of us. So what? Be careful with that man. But don't be truthful. Brother... we should kill the moment we see and go. See where it has fallen! Hey who are you sir? There is camera at the top. Go. Camera... Now it will not be seen isn't it? Tell me where Adi is. We will kill all of you and keep moving. Babu knows that we won't cross Ambattur and come. Why did you come? Go. Have you understood the area? Doesn't anyone come to borrow money? Babu has done. Now we have to do. No one should come and stand here. If someone wants finance they should come to us. We have to do it that way. Hey, bring the phone. Call Babu. - Call Babu. Babu, your boys have made a mistake. What Arunachalam, my boys are playing game at home. Do you have boys at home only? Have you come to the office? Have you put the blame on Adi? It is ok. You break a few tables, chairs, glasses... go and tell Utharan. He will feel proud! Sir, two 'Tumblers' are coming here and creating problems. Hey it is not Tumblers, but Tamilians. Tell Tamilians. - Tamilians. Utharan... everything is wrong. Boys are not ok. They won't be scared, Utharan. The business will fail. It is very painful, Utharan. What is my age? Am I not 55? Now if I go and hit four people will it be good? If Arunachalam is hitting it means Utharamurthy has become weak. Napoleon... - Brother... What happened to that boy? He has become very strong. Why did you go and see him? Babu Jain's boys raised their hand on umpire. I became crazy. Had he been there he would have done something. That is why I went and called him. Sukumar... follow the boy. Why are you asking him to follow me? Ask him to follow Napoleon. Two months ago Napoleon sent a boy and asked me to give him a scooty. I had a doubt. I went and saw to whom he gave the scooty... that was for Arunachalam's daughter! Arunachalam, you are standing like a statue. What this boy says is true? It is true. Greetings. - Greetings. Hey quickly bring Rs.5. Where is the scooty? - It is at home. Is it at home? Stick this sticker on the forehead of the scooty. I know that he bought the scooty from us and gave it to my daughter. But I didn't know that he is Napoleon's man. Hridayam... - Yes. He will corner you. He'll do it very intelligently also. - I will take care. Utharam... why are you giving so much importance to him? Leave it to me. I will take care. You said that you are old. Go home. You are making a mistake, Utharan. Hey, he has come to your house and that too without your knowledge. You are a big man. Go. Utharan... I have stayed with you for 9 years. Give me this one chance. Like you said after that I will go not to my house but to my town. Arunachalam, he has been brought up by me. Only I know about him. Utharan's boys entered our office... they have killed Adi, do you know that? Why did he go to that extreme? You got retired and settled in life. Current DC Marimuthu... is in the custody of Utharan. Both of them are the same 'belt'. What are you going to do? All that I will take care, Babu. Leave it... I gave you 3200 gms jewellery... where have you kept it? - It is in my locker. What are you going to do to Utharan? Drop it in the hundi and tell... I will take care of Utharan. Then you won't do before that. Babu... is Utharan working in a hotel? To quickly stab him and come? Arrange a person who knows his daily activities. We can kill him. Brother... How long has that boy not paid the due? For 2 months. - Kidnap him. Take out a 10,000. I have told that girl's father. Hasn't that man paid yet? Wait... just now I will... What is he saying? He is asking why should he pay. Why? - He is asking, answer him. For the first time in my life a girl loved me. I bought her a scooty with love. It is ok you gave. You have to pay the due isn't it? Sir now, that girl is not with me nor the scooty. Why should I pay the due, sir? Where is it? - What? Where is the girl? - Brother our Arunachalam... Where is the girl? - Boys have gone. They will come. Is the scooty with you? - Yes sir. Give it to Vasan. He will settle the money. - I won't, sir. Why? - Sir, when I was in 1st standard... a girl named Esther presented me an eraser. This is the one. When I was in 8th, a boy, Ponraj gifted me a Raynolds pen. This is that one. When I was in 11th standard a boy, Pandiyan presented a cell phone for my birthday. Scooty is also just like that. My father bought it. That should be with me. Because everything is my memory. How can I give it to him? She is Arunachalam's daughter. - So what? If she is Arunachalam's daughter won't she lie? Go. Hey... have you seen this boy? Along with Vasan? Go. What have you poeple planned? How do you know Napoleon? - Sir... Are you Babu Jain's boy? - No sir. Sir... I went to Napoleon and told him that I want a scooty. He only asked me to meet Hridayam, sir. Other than that really I don't know anything sir. Hridayam... - Brother... What are you doing? Tomorrow there is a branch opening in Nolambur. I was telling the time to DC. Ok, do you have any vengence against me? No. - After I trust you fully... you will be with me and do something to me... Are you doubting me? I asked you just like that. Hey... will you give the document or not? Hey... I have come to take the money. I will take the money and then call. Sir is inside. Go. Brother, tell me finally... don't make me run around unnecessarily. Will you give or not. What Napoleon, now itself you are talking without respecting me. Oh... it is nothing like that. You are living with money. I am running after money. When I know there is a lot of difference between the two of us... it aches. Hey... can I just give, as soon as you ask? If you do one thing for me, I will do one thing for you. Only then it will be a business. Brother, what can I do? Is it confirmed that a branch is being opened for Sukumar? Yes. Then shall we keep the assignment for tomorrow? Brother, I am waiting there for this moment for so long. Hey DC, you have to do it very carefully, ok? I will be there on the spot, Babu. I will take care. Inorder to open Mogappair branch... Utharan has invited me. Only I alone should be there. He should not come at all. Go. Why are you standing? No brother Babu, I don't wish to kill him. In this interest business, to live nicely... to earn a lot... only one problem will arise inbetween. Based on how we handle that problem... our business will thrive. You have been with Utharan for so many years... do you know what it is? If one exceeds our power... he should be finished. Will you do? We both can do business together? When did you come here? Napoleon, I started here and I learnt the business here. Come. Uncle, where is grandfather? Grandfather has gone to God. Do you have any feeling? Father has gone to God. Grandfather has died. Hey Kirthana... that man will never come now. Each one will have 1000s of work. Ask him to go and do that. Through this pipe... Brother has taken loan from this finance company and bought a car. But hasn't paid even a single due. How do you know that he has not paid the due? Where was it all these days? It was lying in the car in which father had an accident. Look inside. All the pages are like this. This was given by the finance company to your brother. They would have noted down separately. No Mridula, I think something is wrong. Will you act for me just once? Don't worry about tomorrow. Lord says that he is there for us. What does it mean? Even though you may be ruling this entire world... this world doesn't belong to you. So Lord says not to worry about tomorrow. Sir... sir. Do you know this finance company? Listen, whatever you want come to the station and ask. You are asking in a Church! I am not used to coming to the station, sir. There is a problem in the family. I had borrowed a small amount. They are threatening that if I don't pay the amount today they will abduct and molest me, sir. I am scared. Please help me, sir. You go home. I will come. Which is your home town? Is it Chennai? No sir. Salem. Where are you staying here? Mogappair. - I will do one thing. I will vacate your house and get you a ticket to Selam. Run away. Why sir? - These are big groups! If caught you can't escape. I am saying for your own good. Sir, I have got a job just now. How can I go back to my home town? Do something, sir. Hey, what do you want me to do? This is how a boy like you... has lost his brother to that group and is after me. What could I do? I was only able to cheat him. I am not cheating you. I am telling the truth. You repay the entire money borrowed from him with interest. Or else, run away. You listen to me carefully. If your aim is to kill the one who killed your brother... it is this group which killed your brother. Or else, you too have a life... if you wish to know whether your brother is dead or alive... your brother is dead. It is not this group which killed him. Later on don't get into trouble and suffer. That's all. Why did you hit me? I didn't hit you sir. You have said the truth so soon. That is why I gave you the bribe. Go carefully. Let the plan be secret. - Ok Napoleon. Will meet at the spot. Poovarasan... don't get emotional. Come in, let us talk. I am telling you. Shall I shoot? Will you also go like your brother? Poor thing... Mridula. Go. You know your brother Punyakoti, only as a call taxi driver. Do you know who Robert is? I am nothing in front of him in doing the assignment. If he corners a party, he is finished. Your brother's car would have stood without any scratch below a bridge. Do you know why? Utharan knows what problem your family is facing. Do you know you didn't get the body? No one knows who Punyakoti is. But everyone knows who Robert is. If you collect a crowd by pasting a poster mourning his death... then what do we do? I have been going to the police station for the past 2 years. Not one police man said the truth. You too say that my brother has been murdered... you are not saying how he died. Hey... policeman will not give an answer to all the cases. Villivakkam Railway Station. Two wheeler stand's auction. The fight is going on between Utharan and Babu. 20 lakhs... - 20 lakhs once... 25... - 25 lakhs... 50 lakhs... Said it is for us. 50 lakhs twice... 50 lakhs thrice. Babu Jain sir, come. Come and sign. Take sir. Robert... come to the office. Ok, we will talk, ok? Utharan calls me and says... Napoleon... Robert has been bought by Babu, kill him. That Robert said that Raghupathy will finalise that place for 25 lakhs and give us. Why he is going up to 50 lakhs? That is what even I don't understand. Didn't understand? Robert has sold himself to Babu Jain for a higher pay. Kill him. He told me that Babu Jain bargained with him but he refused. Then how can he easily give Rs.3 lakhs and buy a car from me? He said that he bought it with the money his brother earned. Hey... he gives Rs.100 daily to his brother. What are you saying? Napoleon, didn't you wish to ride the bullet? Henceforth only you have to ride it. Finish him. Do you know what I did? I have been with him for 4 years. I said it is wrong. Come out. He too came out running thinking that I am in trouble. Hey Robert, they have planned to kill us. Hey... who is it? - Come. Where? Where? I shot him. He died... that's all. If you still want more evidence, then come. In 2013 since the time we killed Babu Jain's man at the Thirumoolar Bus Stand till we killed Ondrai Thalivar at the Avadi Amman Temple entrance the evidence of all the murders which your brother did are in this. Take. Probably it is your brother's curse... today I am standing in the same stage. Don't know if he is going to kill me or am I going to kill him. Will you come along? To watch the fun. Hey Utharan... this stand is with me for the past 20 years. Then why do you cross my path? My boys had come to Adayar for collection... you ask your boys to beat them. Won't it hurt me? Hey... if one is dominating one area... he should not be antagonised. Then if your boys come to Ambattur... shall I cut them to pieces? Utharan... you wish to grow. I will give way. Instead if you think that you will come to Adayar and create problem... you won't know when and where I will kill you. Since the age of 20, I have been searching as to who my enemy is. My eyes can't see you as my enemy. Go. Babu, have you planned any assignment for me? No Utharan. A boy from your group has planned. I am only helping him. That's all. Hridhayam. - Brother... Can you drive the car? - I can. Start the car. In which place is the assignment? Brother, why do you always doubt me? Do you know what the one who was with you is going to do? If one overtakes our power... he should be killed. Don't always think that only the affected one will take revenge. Shall we do business together? Umpire... - Brother... you need not follow me. Go to Nolambur branch. - Ok. Hey... Nolambur branch. Where are you now? - I thought you won't come! How can I believe whatever you say? Come, get in. Napoleon, don't use the gun in emotion as soon as the car stops. You have to take him out and then shoot. Why? - Babu Jain has said. Hey... move the jeep. What is this? Hey... police! Hey... come. Hey... till now I have done only good to you. Then why do you come and stand like this? Brother, I didn't want to fly away leaving you. I wanted to be with you and be everything to you. You threw me far away. That is why I am standing like this. Now if he shoots me, I will die happily. Because I have caused harm to him. That is why you have kept him with you. He is making mistakes. Do you know what all he has done? Hridayam. What have you done? - You only called Hridayam. That is why I shot him. Madhi... buisness rivalry... say it is gang war and finish the case. Ok, sir. Hey... no one need to know about all this. I will take care. Babu sir, you come as soon as I inform the Press. Ok. Why are you asking us to start all of a sudden? Sister in law, come fast if we stay here longer it will be problem. Why? What happened? Came to know who brother is. Came to know where he was and what he did, everything. But we can't do anything. Come fast, let's go. What is this? We can go to our home town and talk. You please come. Are you asking us to run leaving everything behind? Sister in law, I don't know any other way. If he is saying so much then there is surely some problem. First you leave from here. Rest I will take care. Poovarasan, first take them from here. I will myself lock. Take them. Start. - Come. I will send. Come. - Do we surely have to go? By coming away from home town we can earn money here. But we can live only if we earn a background. Come, let's go. Greetings to all those who are present here. This is our 26th branch. I killed a person who was with me. Utharan, you and I can fight all the time. But the one who was under us... raises above us... and fights with us only... do you think it will be good? All this is being done as a service by brother in public interest. Now brother will say a few words. Brother... All of us wish to fly. But can't. We run. If even that is not possible, atleast one should try to walk. Somehow one should progress. Because there is no right or wrong in life. Greetings. Something is wrong. The one who was with me, died in front of me. Feel sorry. Has Napoleon died? - How do you know? I am with you. Won't I know if you have a problem? You should not know. How? - That... I saw it in the news. Why are you getting angry? I am not in a good mood. Go and get ready. Only if you talk to me nicely will I give you happiness. Sir. - Aren't you ready yet? Hey... now if I leave you and go, what will you do? I will kill you. Come. Sir. The time for you to be there is over. I know sir. I will vacate. Hello, what happened? - He escaped. You... somehow bring him home. I will handle. I'll try. Hey who are you? You are coming from inside. Hey... I have been inside for so many days. Security is not meant to watch the fun outside. You should also know as to what is happening inside. Sorry madam. What happened? - Finished. Brother, assignment is over. I've asked the police to come here. You go to the spot. Yes, I am going to the spot. I was waiting for so many years to come to this place. Has Thandal collection finished? It will get over at 7. From tomorrow finish it by 4. - Ok. And then kill all those who were true to Utharan. There is no one. How? One has to be together only to do wrong things. He was doing business. Business rivalry is there in all the business. For that to kill a nice person is stupidity. Police are investigating. We hope they will take proper action. Till then as his business partner, it is our duty to take care of his business from falling. Did he trouble you a lot?
