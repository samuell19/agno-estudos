Put it here. All right, Simon? Not so bad, Mr Martini. Are you sure? No problem, Chief. I told you not to call me that. I've got an order for 240 pieces of anodised aluminium. Can you do them for tonight? Not today, I'm having the afternoon off. Important stuff to sort out. I told Mr Tosani. Next time give me some notice too. Tomorrow morning, then? Yeah, tomorrow. Perfect. Take care, Simon. ALL THE GODS IN THE SKY 269 cases have been recorded in this region in the last 3 months. The regional health authority recommends you go for a check-up. Around 80% of the population are... Found it! Let me see. You can see it. It's not for girls, so push off! I told you Daddy had hidden it. Let me see! Stop it, idiot! Give it to me, I said! You want it? OK, just a sec. Give it! Let's see if you can do it. It's really heavy. If you can't do it, give it back. Of course I can do it. Push the switch thing. What switch? There, under your finger. I can't, it's stuck. It's not, you have to push harder. I can't, it's too hard. Give it back, then. I won't! I can do it, I can... Sit up properly or you'll get it everywhere. Like that. There. Dominique stood up, a delicate seashell in her hand. "Good fishing?" A warm and familiar voice, which she'd often heard in her dreams, reached her ears. Dominique turned... Eat nicely, please. Where was I? ...without quite believing the words she'd just heard. Patrick de Saint-Léger... was standing behind her. His handsome eyes looked tenderly at the young girl. Dominique felt that she was blushing. But Patrick pretended not to... What's that? What have you done? Couldn't you wait till you've finished eating? What's that look for? What's with you today? It's your birthday in a few days. You'd have been 28. Shit! I've been thinking. I'll never let them take you away. Never, you hear me? The fuckers can come! They'll be too late! The others will be here! You'll have to be ready. It's a matter of days. Get used to the idea. It'll be a big change. Hello, do you have an appointment? Yes. - Your name? - Simon Dormel. Hello? Your appointment was yesterday, Mr Dormel. So what do I do, just leave? Wait, I'll ask the doctor. - Yes? - I'm going to stop coming. I would advise against that. And you don't really have a choice. There's no point. There is a point, believe me. How are you feeling today? Not so bad. Be more precise. I'm still pissing blood. I know what that means. I repeat, you do not have cancer. It's an irrational thought. All the tests were negative. I know what I'm saying. Right. Did you get the home help that I recommended? We agreed not to talk about that. It's sorted. Is it sorted? I told you I can manage on my own. I've looked after her for 20 years. I won't let some bitch fuck with her! Calm down, sir. And I'll ask you to moderate your language. I have a responsibility to ensure you provide proper care. If you don't, your sister must be institutionalized. That means a doctor and a psychologist will re-evaluate her condition and your competence. That's the law. You'll have to accept it. She's staying with me. If you behave like this, I have serious doubts about that. Right. We'll be in touch very soon. Are we done? Yes. For now. How much? - Ten euros. - Are you sure? Yeah, I'm sure. Go and check. Ten, then. Is Antoine around? He's smashing up a car. Can I go? Go ahead. Fuck! Hello. Yeah, hi. I'm Simon. You introduced me to Patrick. Yeah, your sister's birthday. He wasn't happy about it. I don't know, he didn't say. But he doesn't want to do it again. From what he told me, I'm not surprised. You wouldn't have anyone else? I might have. What do you offer in exchange? I don't have much. What do you want? An option on your van. Next year it's mine, OK? By next year a lot could... OK or not? - I scratch your back, you scratch mine. - OK for the van. I know a bloke, his name's Michel. He'll do anything for cash. Where can I meet him? Fucking hell! What did we say? You're not my dad. You're a pain! We said you'd stay away from the cars! This is my space! Didn't we agree? Ghosts go where they want. If you keep this up, I'll put you in a home. Understand? You're not my dad. Don't worry. - No problem. - No, but... She's my niece, Zoé. Her mum's dead, too much pesticide. She's got no dad. I took her in. I get the family allowance. But... she's weird. A lot of imagination. Weird, aren't you? Bloody kid! My name is Zoé Debar. I'm nine. What's your name? Simon. Go on, clear off! And stop making yourself up like a whore. You're not my dad and you're a damn liar! How do I get in touch? With Michel. How do I get in touch? Ask Lolita, she knows him. Now off you go, I have work to do. Thanks. What do you want Michel for? I have to see him. I'm not his secretary. Give me his number. Antoine said it's OK. Antoine can say what he likes... I need that number! Tell the fucker to settle his debts. Or he'll end up in the boot of my car. I'll tell him. Can you give me a ride? Get off my van. What the hell? What do you want? I'm bored, there's nothing to do here. It's no fun. Well, all of life is like that. And then you die. Get used to it. And Antoine isn't my uncle. I don't even know who he is. It's nothing to do with me. - What is it you want? - To see people. - I'm always on my own. - I'm not the right person. I don't know many people. You live on your own? Almost. You're not married, you have no family? You're pretty nosey! I live with my sister. We don't like seeing people. You've got a sister? That's so cool. I could play with her. Please take me! I hardly knew my big sister. I'll behave, I promise. I'll bring you back in an hour. No acting up! I promise! Go and ask for permission first. But wait for me, I'll be right back. You believe in ghosts? Yes, I do. I know they exist. Do you? I don't know. I've never seen one. But maybe. Some nights my mum comes to see me. Even though Antoine says she's dead. But when I put out the light before going to sleep, I see her, she's in my room. She comes towards me and her eyes are all black. Blimey! Yeah. Then she sits on my bed, puts her hands round my neck and strangles me. Why does she do that? I dunno. Maybe she thinks I'd be better off with her. But when I tell Antoine, he says I'm crazy. He doesn't even believe me! I'm not crazy! I know you're not. These idiots don't understand. You should keep it to yourself and never tell them. If you talk, you're screwed. Can I put my head out of the window? If you like. This is Estelle, my sister. What's wrong with her face? An accident. Go and get to know her. Go on! I know what we'll play. Really? What? Make-up artist! Watch. I'll leave you alone. Your name is Estelle, right? I'm Zoé. I'll make you a lot prettier. You need to contour your lips, give them volume for a plumper pout. There. Then we have to make your eyes stand out. That's really important. It's the first thing you notice about someone. We have to use a lot of black. Close your eyes. We have to go all the way round to give you lovely almond eyes, like a princess. Then a thick foundation, to cover up your scar. Now you look like a real princess. You see? Pretty, eh? In a fairy tale I'd be a knight. I'd kiss you on the mouth to wake you from your eternal sleep. What are you doing? We're playing. - I'm perfectly well. - It's not a reproach. And it's none of my doing. It's just a precautionary measure. In your interest. - I'm sick of always being watched. - Don't see us as your enemies. Come on. Stay calm and polite, and everything will be fine. Come on, Simon. Sit down, please. Hello, Mr Dormel. - You know why you're here? - No. People have told you bullshit. I'm fine. I'm not so sure. We've received information. You're not legal, Mr Dormel. According to your doctor's prescription, you are taking... Ziprasidone. A type-4 antipsychotic. You can't work on the folding machines. You lied to us on your form. That's a violation of medical confidentiality. I didn't lie, I stopped taking it. I had a blood test for my work medical. Ask them. Look, Mr Dormel. If you decided by yourself to stop the treatment, it's no more reassuring. - Can I say something? - Go ahead. He's always worked well. I've never had a problem. He keeps his head down and works hard. But you've seemed upset recently. We just don't want you to hurt yourself. He could work on the pallets. Why not? Is that OK, the pallets? For the time remaining. What do you mean, "the time remaining"? Yeah, that's OK. Can I go? Please. - Well? - Nothing. But I have a good feeling today. Irina, pass the bread, please. It is near of you. You take! Are you joking? You can reach out, I have to get up. You're eating? What am I doing? I bust my balls to put bread on the table. Your job is to pass it to me. There are some things you have to learn. Those fuckers have put the taxes up again. They're all as bad as each other. Growing fat on our labour while we've got sod all. We're supposed to thank them too. Well I say, "Suck my dick!" I agree. They can suck my dick too. We know how it goes. - They promise it all and give nothing. - You're right. Bunch of useless bastards! One day I'll do myself in, I'm telling you. Blow my brains out. It'll be the fault of them poofs! What do you think? I understand nothing when you speak. Do you understand any of that? - Nothing, to be honest. - Me neither. But I'd give her one. Dédé, for fuck sake! Hang on! I can fucking see him. I see him. That's the little bastard. He's there. Look. Yes, that's him all right. Son of a bitch! I'm gonna have a word with him. What are you doing? Nothing. You've been coming here for weeks. It doesn't look like nothing to me. To me it looks like you're doing something. What's it to you? What's it to me? You're on my property, arsehole! You're the arsehole. Your property stops there. This is mine. Your property is in ruins, you've got nothing. This is mine, arsehole! Next time I see you here, I'll blast you with buckshot. I'll say I thought you were a boar. Understand? You'll understand soon enough. Hello. Hi. What can I get you? I'll have a Coke, please. Don't have any. Then a fruit juice. Nor that. Surprise me, then. Know who you remind me of? No. What's his name again? I don't know. Hélène! What's his name, that dickhead on the TV? The one who makes me laugh! What do I owe you? Two euros forty. Hello, thanks for coming. - I'm Michel. - Simon. As I explained, I wanted to see you before and talk. - I don't like computers. - No problem. It's quite understandable. Well, then? Explain what it's all about. It's for my sister. Right. That's pretty original. I have to do this for her. She's disabled. - Disabled? - Yes, I told you. You said she was dependent. I thought it was your wife, and that "dependent" meant "in love". Not a disabled sister. That's not the same. Is it a problem? It's a misunderstanding. How disabled is she? Heavily. I help her all I can. Heavily? Well, to be honest... I don't know. - Thanks for coming. - Wait! Wait, sit back down. All right. - But I'll want a bit more. - How much? 150. No. 50. 100. - Let's say 100. - 60, I can't go any higher. OK, it's a deal. This stays between us. Of course. We need a transfusion! - Good evening. - Come in. Thanks. It's a beautiful property. As you see, the inside is a different story. Yes, it's quite... uncluttered. It was my parents' house. I can't even afford to heat it. It's falling in ruins. It's upstairs. Her name is Estelle. This is Michel. Do you like him? You fancy him? Oh, yeah! Is she conscious? - Is it what she wants? - What's all this? You think I don't know her? It's been 20 years! - Well, it's not obvious. - You think you know more than me? Of course she's conscious. Without human contact she'd be dead by now. If you say so. The money's on the table. See you later. Can you hear me? Do you understand? Oh, fuck! My name's Michel. I'm sorry. Can I have a cigarette? Do you smoke? I'm starting. I've never seen you at the smoke break. Got a light too? How long have you worked here? Eight months. It's temporary. Oh, yeah? You're Simon, right? - That's right. - I'm Mickey. Why do you never talk to anyone? You wouldn't believe me. What wouldn't I believe? Nothing. I just want you to know that... Well, Martini told us... What did Martini say? That if you have any problems, you can talk to us. Martini talks too much. He should keep his nose out. - Well, I've told you. - Yes, you have. I do have a problem. A doctor. A snitch. I want him dead! What? What are you on about? - Can you help me? - Are you serious? No, I'm joking, I don't have any problems. Glad to hear it. What are you doing? Come on, I'll take you to the infirmary. It's OK, Chief. I have to go now. Mr Dormel? Can you hear me, Mr Dormel? I'm calling from social services. It's very important that I come to... I'm not interested. "Marcus, get up. "Of course I will marry you. "I've already told you." He raised his eyes. She found him so handsome. "My heart is already yours, Mr de Saint-Ange. "And my body will be yours tonight, my beloved." She took his face in her hands and placed a kiss on his forehead. What are you doing here? Seeing Estelle. You can't come without warning and you can't see her. She's tired right now. - Go home. - I don't have a home! - I don't want trouble with your uncle. - He's not my uncle, I told you! Stop shouting, calm down. Someone's calling you. Where? A ghost behind you, calling you. I don't believe in your ghosts. Look more carefully. - Go home. - I don't have one. Estelle! Estelle! No, don't! - Of course I can do it. - We're so close to the goal! What more do I have to do? I've done everything you've asked! Everything! When will you help me? Shit! Sorry. I'm sorry. I don't know what came over me. I won't do it again. I quit my job. I'm done with the factory. For the time remaining I'll be able to look after you. Now get some rest. You won't tell him, eh? I wanted to see you. You must be bored, locked in your room all the time. I feel sad for you. Once, when I was little, I was really naughty and my mum locked me in the cupboard. After an hour I went mad. I screamed and cried so much that I fainted. But I miss my mum. I'm really happy to have a friend like you, though. I've got an idea. If you stay here you'll die. You have to escape. To do that, you have to train. Come here. Estelle, come towards me. Move. You have to do it alone. No one will help you. You've been like this too long. You must wake up. Come to me. Give me your hand. That's it. Come to me, Estelle. Medical centre, hello. Hello. It's Simon Dormel. You're subject to a compulsory care order and you've missed appointments. Well, I'm here now. You have no appointment today. Wait. - Mr Dormel? - Yes. The doctor will see you, but this is the last time. - Mr Dormel. - Hello. Please come in. Well? You were passing, so you thought you'd pay me a visit? Not exactly. There are rules, Mr Dormel. That's how society works. With rules. You tend to forget them. Your rules are unfair. They're never in my favour. I work hard to look after Estelle, it's all I care about. Are you still taking your medication? Tell me the truth. I fear you're not cooperating. You stopped the Ziprasidone and you're having a paranoid episode. Let me tell you something. It would be criminal of me to allow you to keep your sister at home. You can't take care of yourself. The only thing that makes me hesitate about having you committed is your job. - You... - It was you! You sent them my medical files! I beg your pardon. You should beg my pardon! But it's too late. Goodbye, Doctor. It is not in your interest to behave thus, Mr Dormel. What the hell is this? What are you doing here? How did you get in? I hid in the wardrobe. The wardrobe. Has she been nice to you? She hasn't bothered you? Well, since you're here, you can read to her. - Can you read? - Yes, I can read! Chapter 17. Chapter 17. The setting sun's rays behind him made Mr de Saint-Ange look... flam... flamboyant. Hermeline was irresistibly attracted to this man whom she barely knew. She felt a shiver of desire up her spine. That'll do. Go back now. Mum came to see me last night. She told me to tell you that they won't come. Why do you say that? You don't know what you're talking about. That's rubbish. It's not rubbish! They'll never come for you! Or Estelle! What happened to her was your fault. No one will come and save you! Go back to your uncle! And never come here again! I've told you he isn't my uncle. Her heart beat faster. It was pounding wildly. What was this new emotion she felt? Could it be what they called "love"? What are you doing? Those drawings you stick everywhere? I don't know. They're... things I have in my head. Can I go? You'll stay at the table until your sister has finished. I've told you before. While you live here, you'll stay at the table until she's finished. - You owe her that respect. - Respect? I don't owe her anything. The police said it was your fault for leaving the gun. - Shut up! - It wasn't my fault. Don't talk to your dad like that. You don't have to remind me. Estelle does that every day. Simon, come here! Get back here! Get back here! Simon! I'm sick of it! - Get back here! - I'm sick of it! Open this door! Open this door! Leave me alone! Open this door or I'll smash it down! Just leave me alone! I never want to see you again, do you hear me? Never! Open this door! Leave me alone. What happened was your fault. It's your fault! It's all your fault! Yes, yes, I'm coming! Hello, Mr Dormel. I'm Carine Charles, your new social worker. I've been trying to call you for three days. So I decided to come. It's simpler. Can I come in? I'd rather not. I insist. I have to check the conditions in which your sister is living and evaluate your ability to take care of her. A note from your psychiatrist implies that you've been suffering from paranoia again. We're worried. About your sister's wellbeing and your own. The shrink's a bastard. He wants to take Estelle off me. He doesn't know what's happening here. It's not paranoia to think he hates me. Could we go to Estelle's room, please? It's upstairs. It's not a stimulating environment for someone on medication. If you'd like to refurnish, be my guest. - You lock her in? - No, I don't. It's for her safety. The front door has no lock. So when I go out, I lock this door. In case of burglars and things like that. It's not like locking her in! She's paralysed from head to toe! Yes, I see. There's not much to steal. Look at the state she's in. I take care of her all the time. The TV gives her a headache. I read to her, shower her, massage her, stimulate her... You've been here a minute and you're lecturing me! - Don't touch her! - It's not what you're doing, but how. Young lady, I'm a social worker. We're going to look after you. We'll come for her this evening. And we'll have to notify the authorities. It's unacceptable to lock her up and leave her without any care. Sir. I work for the social services. I was sent here by my bosses. They know I'm here. Don't try to frighten me. Now calm down! I'm very calm. You're the one who's tense. I'm warning you. If you touch me, you'll be in big trouble. You'll never see your sis... Calm down. All we want is the wellbeing... That's good. I see you're making progress. That's important. But carry on like that, you'll get hurt. For your safety I'll have to tie you to your bed. That's not what you want, is it? That's what I thought. Come on. No more silliness, eh? Why do you do things like this to me? Especially right now. When everything could work out. It makes no sense, Estelle. What were you hoping? You have to show more respect! You won't be able to act like that, they won't allow it! Never, you hear me? Never! Happy birthday, Estelle. You hear that? It'll be soon now. Aren't you hungry? Come with me, sweetie. Can I have another? The men have some questions first. Coming? Don't be scared. I'm not scared. That's good. It's the young girl. Her name's Zoé. Tell them exactly what you told me earlier, OK? Hello, Zoé. All right? Yes. Come here. Have a seat. So... So we remember everything you say, I'm going to film you, OK? It's normal. I'll contact social services. Can I have another, please? We'll get you one, but answer our questions first. Then I promise you all the chocolate you want. It's really important that you tell us the whole truth. He's not my uncle. Who isn't your uncle, Zoé? Simon. Right. And who is Simon? A friend of yours? He's the one who feeds ladies to his pigs. What do you mean by that? Zoé. I want you to find my mum first. Antoine said she's dead. But he's a dirty liar, I don't even know him. She can't be. You don't just die like that. That's not how it works. Don't worry. We'll find your mum. Zoé, please... What did you tell the policewoman? That I saw a lady being eaten by pigs. She wanted to save Estelle. Can I have my chocolate now, please? Hang on, Zoé. Don't tell us fibs. If we're to find your mum. Did you imagine it or see it on TV? I know what I saw. I was hiding in the barn. I've got some info. It's serious. What's your name? Zoé Debar. What's your real name? You can tell me. You mustn't be afraid any more. Aline Nostra. The Nostra girl from the... Néron case? You've been missing for 5 years. It's over now. Can I have my other chocolate now, please? I'm Simon Dormel. My GPS coordinates are 51°28'38"N. My health had been deteriorating for days. Dramatic things have been happening. That's the signal that they're close. I was first contacted 25 years ago. I know them well. The signal is more and more intense. They emit it for longer every day. I'm hearing banging in the chimney again. Listen! You see! You hear that? Can you see? When you find this film, we'll be gone. All your attempts to separate me from Estelle have failed. Where we're going you can't do anything to us, you fuckers! The youngest don't like the light. The house has to be dark... They're here! They're here! What? Shit! Fucking hell! What? Mr Simon Dormel? I'm Inspector Lavant. We're investigating the disappearance of Carine Charles. We have some questions for you. Can we come in? My wife's walking around naked. You'd better stay there. You'd better put something on her. We have questions for you. Give me a minute. Come on, it's the big day. Take us. Take us now. Now! Fucking bloody hell! Take us now! We're ready. Take us. Now. Now. Fuck me! We're ready. We're ready. We're ready. No, I wanna see my sister! Let me go! What are you doing? We can't leave without her! We have to get her! Please! Estelle! Estelle! Sister. He's awake. Let's go and tell her. Did you tell Dr Cartier? Yes. When I saw him this morning. He was awake, he'd tried to remove his cannula. You shouldn't have. You should always refer to me first. - It's the procedure. - That's enough! Go and get her. I'll see you in his room. Yes, Sister. Miss. Open up, it's Anna. Do you know why my parents never come to see me? They will when you're better. I'm sure they haven't forgotten you. Maybe they've been run over by a bus with faulty brakes. No, I don't think so. Go to your room, I'll come and see you. - OK. - All right? - Is he still conscious? - Still. May God have mercy on his soul for what he did. The Lord has postponed his hour of judgement. They both survived for a reason. It's not up to God to choose between punishment and mercy. It's up to Estelle to decide. Only then will she find peace. God will judge him in time. Was he solely responsible? I feel it's dangerous to react with too much haste, Sister. Let us calm our emotions. Hello, Miss. What's happened is incredible. We didn't expect it. Hello, Estelle. Can he speak? We're not sure. Probably not. Can I see him? You may. Sister, please. Hello, Miss. He awoke earlier. He seems conscious but can't move. Can I be alone with him? Of course. Let us leave her alone with him awhile. Dr Cartier is here to examine your brother. Hello, Miss. Congratulations on your progress these last few months. It's very encouraging. Can you hear me, Mr Dormel? If you wonder where you are, you're with the Augustinian nuns. I'm Dr Cartier, here to ensure that your return among us goes well. Do you understand? I'll remove your cannula. It'll be a little uncomfortable. There, all over. You've been in a coma a long time. There was little chance you'd wake up. You'll be placed in a medical unit better adapted to your new condition. I forgot my radio. I need new batteries. Ask Sister Marie. I don't see the point in letting your unit know. If they know he's awake, he'll be taken away from Estelle. It'll undo all the progress she's made. You're forgetting your mission here. You're losing your way. My mission is to accomplish what I believe to be right, Doctor. It's not up to you to decide what is right. You don't know what you're talking about. Some things are beyond you. He'll stay here, and that's that. Have a good day. We'll see. Goodbye, Sister.
