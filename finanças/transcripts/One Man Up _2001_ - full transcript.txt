What can I say? That it's better to have loved and lost, rather than putting linoleums in your halls? Draw does not exist. Pele ONE MAN UP What the fuck! What the fuck are you doing? Did you get dumb, fucking assholes?! Are you jerking off in the field?! How the fuck could you do this to me??! Forget it. You're not going to screw me over! You now get out and do what I fucking tell you... ..If not, I'll kick your ass. I really mean it! What are you doing, fags? Don't you want to qualify for the UEFA? Aren't you interested in the match premiums? Well, I am. Did you get it? What are you doing, dickhead? You're just a half jerk, you're in the team only to run. You must win the ball. Stupid! Palumbo! You have really pissed me off! What do you think of when I talk to you in the training? Do you think of those four whores you fuck every day? You're on drugs, aren't you? One more time. How should I tell you that I don't want to see that shit in my team? Anyway, you have taken the wrong drug... cause you're a disaster in the side. Take another dose, so you can come out dead! - Coach, I.... - What if I...? - Don't you dare talk. Asshole. So, let's go on. Ok, they're better than us... ... But I didn't see a single well-done counterattack. I said "long balls". You did only two. And you let Palombo do those. Well done! You chose a big fucking leader! I told you the play must go from Russo. No sir! Coach, I have something to say: ... I think that instead of staying at the back, if the team risesa bit... ..we can resist in the midfield,.. ..We shouldn't play just with throw-ins.. For instance, me and Gennaro could advance with head kicks. You know what, Pisapia? No one has ever pissed me off as much as you,.. ... Are you aware of this? Are you the coach or the player? If you want to be a coach just quit playing.. ..You even don't play that good! But since you're in this sewer,,.. ..you can't allow yourself to say how the team should behave tactically! Where are you going, Pisapia? How you dare?! I'd like to say goodbye with my dearest thing: "The night"! #I don't listen anymore..# #..To the radio we always listened together.# #Then home it's not my home.# #The night..# #..a thousand lights that..# #..don't light one..# #..like me,..# #..fire burns on the sidewalks and see..# #.. these souls going around in paillettes.# #Silence.# #Nothing else...# #Nothing else..# #..The night.# Antonio, go. It's red. Are you Antonio Pisapia? Damn, Antonio you're great! The goal you scored on Sunday was a work of art! I got so excited! How could you score in a semi reverse shot? You're a centerback! Why? Can't a League A centerback make a semi reverse shot? Anyway, thanks Antonio. We enjoyed it! The most beautiful first tour since years! - Will we start in Milan next week? - Yes. I want an aquarium in my hotel room. Ok, whatever you wish. An aquarium? No problem. All this success! I really enjoyed it, Tony. The whole public enjoyed it. At least you sang "Long nights in the bar". It's like Ballantines: The more it gets old, the more you like it. Do you recall that nobody cared about it in Sanremo? Of course Tony. Cause that's a mature song. It's song that should be sang like an adult. It's a song for adults, Tony! - Thank you, sisters. That's enough. - We're not sisters. - You are to me. Genny, settle the girls. - Yes. - Did you like the massage? - Very much, I feel relaxed. I always say it: if eastern people organize themselves,.. ..western people have no way out. Listen, Tony, I booked the Geg?. So you're an asshole! Last week cooked a bass that... ..that I should have thrown at his face! Call Salvatore, book at his'. Titta, what's up? You haven't opened your mouth. - I have to tell you something, Tony. - Say it. I can't come to Salvatore: My daughter has flu. What the fuck is this news? We've always celebrated the first concert. - She has 38,5 degrees. - So what? Are you an aspirin? You're the drummer and you'll come with us. He can't wait to turn his back on life. Genny, 33 years old, brown, large necklace, black and pink dress. You go out. If she's here, introduce her to me. I got it. Coming. Did you enjoy the concert? Very much. I got excited. When I noticed that you got excited, I sang only for you. We felt the same way, isn't it unbelievable? We were distant, there were hundreds of people between us... ..but we were in a total intimacy. -Your songs enter under the skin... - What's your name? - Monica. - Monica... You're wonderful! You resemble the girl from Dallas. Pamela? No one told me that before. It's true. I've got a sixth sense for resemblances. This dress is wonderful, too! It would fit over the chair of my bedroom. My husband is outside. He's waiting in the car. He'll wait... Just for a kiss. No, it's not possible. .. I'm faithful to him. Go now. And if I want to see you again? Look in your handbag. You'll find my phone number there. Even my wife jumped off the chair. A spectacular goal, Antonio. Congratulations! Thank you, president. Listen, I wanted to ask you about the future... I've told you not to worry about the future: ...There's always place among us. You're a heritage to the society. As a matter of fact, I already started the course. Well done! But, please keep in mind,.. ..Stay focused. We must qualify for the UEFA. - Stay calm. Bye for now. - Goodbye. Who was it, Antonio? The President. He congratulated with me. Come, Diana, I'll show you the rest. - I'm happy you dedicated the goal to me. - The least that I could do. Moreover, it's so unjust that you're not the coach anymore. Why? You were at the end of the table with me, now you're in the UEFA zone. Well, in the middle of the table. Ah, always a pessimist. Listen to me. Just enjoy the moment. That was a once in a lifetime goal. Damn it! And the green lemons? Tony, please careful with the plant! I can't even prepare a caipirinha at my home! I couldn't find green lemons. I bought the Schweppes. You pissed me off with these Jin tonics. I wanted a caipirinha. - Veronica called. - Finally she decided to. She had another exam, she said it went ok. Ah Tony, then something unbelieavable happened. What? She saw up close the queen of England. - Do you understand what emotion? - What a fun! - I'll hang out with the guys tonight. - I'll go at your mother's. I'm not used to the new house. Do whatever you wish. You can see everything from here. While I have a building in front. How are our earthworms doing? The breeding of earthworms is a long-term investment. - Me and Sossio have got a very very quick deal in our hands. - What is it? A draw deal. Me, Sossio, Lorusso e Palumbo are all in. - Six have agreed from the other team. - What the fuck are you saying? We have to win the match, we're in for the UEFA spot. We're in the UEFA zone. We won Sunday and you scored a goal. Did you forget? It's 10 million for each. And also the money we'll bet on our own. - I'm not in. And the coach will kill us. - He'll kill us if don't do it. He has already placed 30 millions of his own. I'm out of this. You know, I did it a couple of times,.. ..but I've told you other times. I won't do it anymore. Listen to me. I'll make you another present. ..A saleswoman working with my wife. I already had her. And that slut told me after we fucked: .."Next time bring that friend of yours Pisapia, I like him too much". Don't bother me, I'm out of this. Ok? You know you're doing a big stupidity. Things come out sooner or later. The newspapers have already insinuated. You're a coward, Antonio, and also irresponsible. How long do you think we can go on playing? Two, three years... What will we do then? We can't do a fucking thing. We know only to play football. And while we're playing football,.. ..we must earn as much money as we can. Do you understand? After two or three years I'll become a coach. Understand? Are you listening? I won't ruin my reputation. Fuck you, Antonio! Hey, Aldo! How are you? You look good. Genny, a cigarette! Tony! I was at the concert last night! - Did you enjoy it? - Beautiful! - I'm glad. Fire please! Hi. - Hi! - Where have you been? I called you. - I was at Marco's. - What for? Ok, I'm busy now. Call you tomorrow. Tony, I have to talk to you! What is it? Is it urgent? We'll talk after. Tony! Listen! I was at your concert. I enjoyed it very much. I think I sang fine. Titta, I don't want to loose again tomorrow. So let's agree: when you hit, I'll stay at the net,.. ..when I hit, you'll stay back. - Won't I go to the net? What the fuck would you do there? You suck at the net! - You've got the attitude of a gay. - I haven't been training lately. It's been a lifetime since you trained, even with this battery. The next week, in Milan, you must try harder. Otherwise you can go bugger off Fred Bongusto. Do me a favor: go and bring me some Ballantines. Put it on my bill. - Hi, Tony. - Hi. - Anything going on tonight? - Eh? I think there's a lot going on. Isn't it? Yes, it is. Titta, you're an angel! Who is it? Antonio! You're a bastard. Mother! What the fuck are you doing here? Stupid piece of shit. Why do you do these filthy things on your daughter's bed? - How old are you? - 16. It's you who should have died in the end of that sea, fucking coke addict! Mother! What are you saying? It's you who should have died. You! Pass! Follow! Don't stay back. Forward! Novelli! Don't die now! Out! Your full name? Antonio Pisapia. Antonio Pisapia. Born in Narni Scalo.. 15 August 1949. Born in Naples, 15 August 1934. Am I in trouble? Total anesthesia, right? Pisapia, of course you're in trouble! You're accused of violence on an under aged girl. Easy, here you are. Go. Are you awake? I must work. At this hour? I had the dancer's nightmare. It's been 10 days since you sleep at 9 o'clock and wake up at midnight. - Could it be ulcer? What's that got to do? I told you I had a nightmare. Why the TV is set on mute? To not wake you up. The fact is that I'm awake from some time. Why were you holding the phone? I was checking if it worked. You were checking if it worked!? At midnight! What is it, Antonio? The two midfielders, fuck! In this part of the match,.. ... even if they run like crazy, they can't make it. What do you do now? I survive in Rome, I've rented an apartment. Nobody calls me. Well, some times. But always very small parts. - Hello? Genny, I have to come back. - Too early. - But I have my public. A bourgeois public.,.. ... who hasn't forget that you go to bed with little girls. But I was discharged! People don't give a shit about that. That little girl spewed in all newspapers. Arrange me on the TV then. Pope watches TV, Tony. I tried it. They don't want to see you even on the repertoire shorts, at night. What the fuck should I do then? Wait for time to pass. You always earned a lot with me. Hey, I always earned a lot, Tony. Not just with you. Why don't you come over at my place? I cooked bass. I have to go to the hall. Ok, then come later. I'll call you tomorrow. - Pisapia! - Hi, Palumbo! - How are you? - Fine. - How's the knee? - Just for walking. Well, that's enough, Pisapia. What are you doing here? - I have an appointment with the president. - I see. Well, I'm going now. I'm leaving for the Netherlands to check a player. Who? It's a secret, Pisapia. Bye. Limiti 6,.. ..Affinito 5 and a half, Piva 7,.. ..Esposito 4, Riccio 3 and a half. Will we sell this player or not? Who buys him? Sabatino 5 plus, Mariani 4, Amaducci 5, Peluso 4 and a half. President, it's Antonio Pisapia. No my dear. Not today. He wants to be a coach. What about the placement here? - Carlo. - Eh? You take care. The president was busy. You know, it was one of those black days... - ..you know? 3 to 0 at Pescara. - Well, sure. It's nothing. Let's have some coffee. Two cups of coffee, please! So, Antonio, what can I do for you? I... have... taken... since 3 years ago.... - A glass of water! -....Coverciano.... Can't hear you, talk louder. Nothing, Mr. Tagliaferri, I was saying that.. ..I took the coach patent three years ago at Coverciano,.. So, I was asking myself, if... there's a chance... I know Antonio. We have thought a lot about you with the president. For the main team and for the young team. Last year, for instance, when we dismissed Carloni,.. ..you know, it was such a big error, a foolish thing. What can I say? You come when the situation is apodictic. Don't you read the newspapers how apodictic is the situation? In confidence... ..the society is in big financial trouble... ..League B is near, Trevisani is close to being dismissed.. ..and the fans want the comeback of Molosso.. What can I say, dear Antonio? Next season we could find a position for you. ..in the organization chart. However, I was the third of 40 at Coverciano... And in these three years, I've come up with a new idea. Really? What is it? Zone play, high defense, offside tactic and advanced pressing. - And the new idea? - Four strikers. Are you nuts? Sound like crazy, but it's not. Let me show you Mr. Tagliaferri. Here, look. They move in vertical lines, in rhombus form. The advanced midfielder holds the ball... ..and three strikers close to each other for the quick passing. One man more in attack. It's bold Antonio, but.... Three midfielders make a wall in the midfield. You can win matches like this, Mr. Tagliaferri. It's interesting. I'll talk with the president. But now we have to draw some matches in order to remain in the first league. You know what? Come at the start of the next season. - Fine? Agreed? - Ok. Fine. So, I'm going. Fine. Goodbye. Antonio... You know what he said? That the situation is 'apodictic'. I checked the dictionary but it means nothing. Anyway, Trevisani will be dismissed. And they want you. Molosso is fine where he is. But the fans want you. What did he say about you? Always the same: "Next season". I should have packed and gone to Juventus. I was such a fool. At least I'd have a Fiat shop near my home. What the fuck are you talking about? Do you know about cars? You know about football. I'll tell you something: Everything can happen in this shitty life. Maybe. But nothing happens to me. Genny, take more lobster. - Did you take the anchovy? - Mh. Taste the sea bream. How is it? Good. I cook the sea bream even better than Salvatore. - Do you know where I learned to cook the fish? You know the story? - I know. In jail, in the '70, when I was arrested for the first time. Those bastards! Narco traffic. Me? Why should I traffic? "Love sensations" was in the first place, I made tons of money! However, jail is shit. I learned only one thing there: ..there's always someone who cooks the fish better than you do. No fucking thing to do in jail... ..and if one practices himself, he becomes a fish-cooking God. How come this spine? Listen, Tony,.. ..don't you ever do the polyp? I lost a brother for a polyp. You never tell this. No. What can you do. Were you there, too? I've got something for you. What thing? A small thing. A square party in Abruzzi. Something paid by the Municipality. - It's not bad for starting over, is it? - Not at all. So, can we put together the old band? Forget it! You've treated those four like shit for 20 years. Since you're not worth, they escaped like thieves. Titta immigrated to Bongusto. Fuck them, the bastards! Let's get four guys, 4 tour guys. Three. We'll get three. Fine. What are you doing? Going away? Got things to do. Wait, we could relax a bit. I'll offer you my stuff. I've got mine, Tony. But mine is good. Mine is better. I'll call you tomorrow. How did it go with the president? He told me to meet again after some time. Meanwhile? Meanwhile I'll make the scheme perfect. Hello? Hello? Hello?! Meanwhile you could start a job. You could be an insurance agent, many ex-players do it. - Gina told me that Sossio.... - Are you kidding? I'm a coach. Then, you need an license to become an insurance agent. Let's be realistic Antonio. It's been four years since you don't work. We're running out of money. I'm going out. 400. 6 and 40. Not for me. Until 800.000. Fine. Open. - 3 Aces.. - Good. Scuffle! Alberto, I have to talk to you. I'm in trouble. I have doubts regarding the sides. Now? Can't you see? We're playing here. Later? Later... At what time did we settle it, Maurizio? At 18:00. At 18:00. We'll talk another time, Antonio. #Under you home..# #..my road ends. What melancholy!# #Not even the courage to look..# #..The light that vanishes together with you..# #..Forever..# #Nothing else...# #Nothing else..# #..The night.# Hey, another one. #I won't go away# #..from your life anymore.# #In my bed, after an hour,..# #..so fragile, so alone,..# #..while I told you everything,..# #..I asked myself: "Will she stay?"# #You kissed me but didn't talk.# #Then you talked while crying.# #At twenty like me..# #..the love you lost.# Thanks to all. Good night! - As first dishes, we have... - I'll just take a second dish. Ok, we have sausages, lamb, skewer, beefsteak... Couldn't I have some fish? Bass? A codfish would be fine, too! We maybe have just salmon trout. But I must check. What can I say? Bring it to me. With a salad? Mr. Tony, it's a pleasure! Unfortunately, I couldn't come at the concert.,.. ..You know, too much work in here. I wanted to... I've got all your records at home.,.. ..Even the first one, when you played with the Rayban. How was it called? 'Excuse me, my love' by Antonio Pisapia and the Rayban. Did I remember it correctly? You know Tony, I want to ask you a big favor. A bit more on the left. Fine. Come on, Giovanni. Click it! Here's your salmon trout. Let me show you the photo. It's a pity you didn't come at the concert. Because it was my goodbye concert. How was it? Was it beautiful? Yes, it was really a beautiful concert. - Hi. - Hi. Why were you staying in the dark? Nothing. Just thinking. Go to sleep. I've got work to do. Antonio, tomorrow I'm going away. I'm leaving you. Is there another man? We're 35 years old,.. ..and you only think of.... - Slut! I knew you wouldn't understand. - Hello? - It's me. Mother, how are you? Your father died! What? How did it happen? Don't strive to ask Antonio. Don't fucking ask! You haven't met him for years. Mother, you told me not to come home, didn't you? An you immediately agreed with it. Of course. How does it go with Maria? I can stand her. The funeral is tomorrow at ten in the church. I informed you. Bye. Did you take a look at the notes? Yes, but I don't know. I am uncertain. I know that you want a high defense, but 15 meters is too much! You're misbalanced. If the other team has one like Platini: ..a long ball, defense is overcome and that's it. Or you play against someone like me, and you loose the match. I won't loose,.. ..because my players run more than yours.. To run for ninety minutes you must train the heart,... .. then the muscles. These are the principles of aerobics. And who'll play in attack? Jane Fonda? Alberto, you still play with catenaccio and counter-attack! Molosso, using catenaccio and counter-attack,.. .. won 2 leagues and 3 Italian Cups. 10 years earlier. 10 years earlier. Listen, do one thing: Eat before it gets colder. Father! Veronica! When did you come back? Tonight. How's it going in London? Fine. I've been in London. I've played there. - In 1970. - It was 1969. In 1970 you were in jail. I've already heard this story. Don't tell it again. You're right, 1969. '69... Is there always that light rain? Unceasing, continuous... Yes, often. How does school go? Did you have exams? It's ok. By the way, since you study medicine,.. ..if you're free, you should have a look at this... It was grandfather's funeral today morning. Why didn't you come? I woke up late. Besides, I never go to the funerals. But it was your father's! - So Tony! - I woke up late. What would you like? Salvatore, you must give me guarantees about the mussels. What's the issue with them? They're good. We'll have spaghetti with mussels then. For the main course... I have ten coralfish Ginetto brought me. They're terrific! Where did he catch them? In the Procida channel. I don't believe this channel has been offering good seafood lately. Let's make a deal. You taste it. If you don't like them, then throw them away, ok? I've spent my life here... ...and it's never before 5am that I can get to sleep. I'm always sleepy now. Diabetes is to blame. But I'm over it, now. Enough is enough. I'll retire and yield this restaurant. - Why? Have you had any offers? - Each of them worse than the other. It's not the money, cause they've offered me pretty much. But they want to turn it into a pub or a disco. I don't give a damn, but when I pass by, I still want to see that sign "Salvatore a Mare" Salvatore, I was thinking... I'm done with the music. Enough! I don't wanna have anything to do with it anymore. I thought: if you take me as a partner, I could manage the restaurant. Are you serious, Tony? Salvat?, if I'm idle at home, I'll go crazy. They'll take me to a madhouse. Maybe, one of these evenings, I could even sing a song or two for the amusement of our friends. What do you say? I just need a deposit, to be safe. Veronica! Go back, go back, you fucking bastards! Go for it! Gigi, Carlo, get closer! Go, Mauri, go! Block him! Yes! Good, Carlo. But you must roll it earlier. You, Biaggio... Ok. - Geppino, give me a hand here. - Sure. Here it is. Antonio, let me show you something. I am the king of Agropoli, Antonio. Look here. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 units. 120 row cottages with seaview. We can agree that the Agropoli sea matches the beauty of Sardinia. What I'm saying, Antonio, is why don't you buy one of these cottages? Besides, if you buy it while it's still a project, it'll cost much less. Excuse me, are you following me? Sorry, I was a little distracted. - Are you gazing at Elena? - Her name is Elena? I understand you. Wait here. I know her, I'll introduce you. No, no. Forget it. Geppino, are you still willing to draw up this voucher? Sure. Come to our office on Wednesday. Maybe Thursday is better. It's you then. You said 11, but it's 3 already. I woke up late. Will you really do this to me? Died man, I'm doing you a favor. For this car, the market is as promising as for you. I'm a lawyer. Interesting. And I love theater. But there's not much going on in Ivrea. That's why every now and then I take the car and drive to Turin. - Do you like theater? - Very much. What do you like? I like... I love ballet. It's beautiful. Such an interest is rare among men. You are not superficial. This is quite interesting. You haven't asked me about my job and you never make the conversation slip towards the past. And this makes it even more interesting. It never becomes boring. A very silent person... full of mistery... but your eyes say it all. I think I'm in love with you. In any case, I'm married too... Did you say "in any case"? I'd like to go to Capri with you. Tomorrow. We'll go tomorrow. No, tomorrow is Carnival. A friend of mine is throwing a party. Why don't you come? With pleasure. Where have you learnt to kiss so well? As a boy, when I played for Verona. Hello. Tony, sit down, I have great news. - Shoot it. - A cruiser ship, from Genoa to Cairo, the Red Sea. I'll have you aboard cleaning the toilettes, Tony. You're a real friend. I knew you wouldn't forget me. I told you we only had to wait for the dust to settle down. This ship has a certain level, people with money. It's not the shitty boat trip around the Mediterranean. These are insane cabins. Thank you, Genny, seriously. Tony, I'm your manager. Unfortunately, I can't accept it. What the fuck are you saying, Tony? Are you in trouble? Nothing happened. I just don't know... a whole month at sea. I'm getting old, you know. It'll be crowded and too hot down there. It's really not for me. What the fuck do you mean with "too hot"? It's a lot of money! I don't know, this story with the ship... I see it as a step back. If you have anything better for me, I could consider it, think about it. But this ship would really mean a step back. I appreciate you thought about me, but I have other plans. Tony, you son of a bitch! A step back?! You're dead, Tony, and I'm trying to get you back to life! Do you know what they said when I mentioned your name? That they didn't want you! That their passengers are middle aged folks, that they don't have junkies or teenagers aboard, that they'd rather have Fred Bongusto. And I was an idiot, telling them you're better than Bongusto, that you gave up the drugs and all that shit, Tony! Don't take it so seriously. Give them Fred. Go fuck yourself, you son of a bitch! In my opinion, TV quality has decreased in recent years. I don't agree completely, but we can discuss it. Hi, Lucilla. You look gorgeous. - You too. - Lucilla, my dear. - Thanks for the plants, they were great. - Let's go see them. - How are you? - Fine. Forgive my delay. The traffic was terrible. - I'm coming. - A moment, please. - Yes? Who are you? I'm Antonio Pisapia, a friend of Elena's. Ah, of course. Please. Thanks, my dear. Come in! - I am Lucilla. - It's a pleasure. - Let me take your coat. - Thanks. Oh gee, poor you... I got it. You thought it was a costume party. - It's not. Hasn't Elena told you? - No. - What can we do now? - I'll go home. No, wait. You'll wear something from my husband's wardrobe. Come with me to our room. Wait, the living room is full of guests. I want to make love to you. Now? Yes. I had something else in mind for our first time. The first time can be very disappointing. It might be better to enliven it a little, don't you agree? That's my daughter. Come, we're dancing. Let's go to Capri tomorrow? Yes. I'll wait you there. Lello! Tell the boys... to put the small pastry counter where the aquarium was. The indoor tournament is over. How was it? We won. Yes, but it was a pain the ass, Alberto. I want to coach a real team. I feel I'm ready. Antonio, I must tell you something important. Anything new happened? Trevisani was fired. They called me back in. - And you? - I accepted. I barely got back in and had a fight with the President. And why? Because of you. They won't let me have you as my assistant. Till the end of the championship that stupid Palumbo will have to stay. They say the players have a good connection with him, that we shouldn't disrupt the harmony and this sort of bull shit. It doesn't matter. No, it does matter. I only accepted because they offered me a 2 year contract, assuring me that next year I could bring you in as my assistant. You just have to wait a few months. Let it be. They'll probably change their minds when July comes. No, they won't. Otherwise, I'll quit. I had to accept it, Antonio. It was a load of money. Thus I'll be able to retire in peace. It was the right decision to accept it. Don't be worried about me. You just have to wait a few months. Will you come over for dinner? Hello. Genny, I must get back. I need a come back. I won't talk to you, Tony. It's not the time to play the offended one. I'm tired of it, Tony. I'm not your manager any more. I need that job. Fuck you, Tony! I won't say it again Bongusto will be on that ship. Do you know why, Tony? Cause you can't clear customs with a pound of coke on you! We need to talk. Pisapia, what are you doing here? - We must talk. - Let's talk then. How did you know I was here? You told me many years ago that you come to the office every Sunday after the match. Let's make it quick. I must attend a wedding. The assistant coach should be chosen by Molosso. Should. But I take the decisions here. - And you chose Palumbo, that moron. - Bull shit. Palumbo is smart. And the next season? Molosso wants me. What do you say? Next season we'll see whether Molosso will still be around... whether I'll still be around. Heaven knows what will happen. What do you mean? "Whether he's still around"? Molosso has a contract. Contracts are signed and unsigned. Molosso is fine for now. I had to keep him: the fans were crushing my balls, hurling at my doorstep every second night. But why can't I be the assistant coach? I told you. Palumbo is smart, he's a promise. I got it. Next year you'll drop Molosso and promote Palumbo, right? Listen. For me, you don't have what it takes to be coach. Why do you insist? Nobody has called you in, not even a minor team. I'm telling you, try another job. Why this obsession about being a coach? If you're concerned about the vouchers, I'll issue whatever you need. What are you saying? What do they have to do with it? In any case, I'd be willing to coach even the junior team. It doesn't have to be necessarily the main team. It would be presumptuous from me to ask you that. Antonio, I must tell you what I think. Soccer is but a game and you are a man of sorrows. Give me this octopus. Octopus, Tony? You never bought one before. And now I do. Hello? I'm calling on behalf of the producers of the TV program "Public Confessions". Have you had the chance to watch it? - No. - It doesn't matter. The program is hosted by Gigi Moscati, who interviews famous guests about their personal lives. - We'd love to have you on the program. - Call me again tomorrow. We can offer our guests a 3 million reimbursement for their time. Moreover, it is broadcast from Naples, which would make it easier for you. If possible, we'd love to hear a potpourri of your old hits. I never sing potpourris! Call me again tomorrow. Ok. If you have any doubts about our program, you can watch a live broadcast tonight at 10:30. Call me again tomorrow. Ok, bye. The bashful tend to assume a defensive position. They tend to hide behind the strikers, avoiding to draw any attention. It worked well as long as the man marking was in use. But since the zone marking was introduced, there was no place left for the bashful. They were thrown into the spotlight. I never knew how to do it. But you did quite well in the spotlight... scoring a spectacular bicycle kick goal. A half bicycle kick. - What goes through your mind in front of the goal? - I've always sought to avoid the goal. Right, at that moment, when I was about to kick the ball... I saw the fans. 80.000 people and all eyes on me. Some days later, however, during the training... your ligaments were torn and your life is turned upside down. What happened? I haven't been able to get back on the field after the accident. - I decided to become a coach. - Are you coaching now? - No. - How come? The President of my former team had assured me... I'd have a chance to go on working with them. Later, he went back on his word. He said I don't have what it takes to be coach. How can anyone say that, if no one ever gave me a chance to show it? Anyway, I don't want to talk about it. I want to say something else. Today... I've met someone... Please, go on. You were saying you've met someone today. Now we'll show you a short film about Antonio Pisapia. We'll be right back. Where do we go? Take me to the airport. Are you leaving? Yes. I must go to Holland to evaluate a player. Yes? Here's Tony Pisapia. I'm supposed to be on your show next week. Can you do me a favor? I need the number of Antonio Pisapia? We can't tell the private telephone numbers of our guests. You must give me immediately the number of Antonio Pisapia. Is it clear? the telephone number of Antonio Pisapia. Is that clear? Is it 7:00? # GR 1.# # Breaking news.# # Naples: The former soccer player, Antonio Pisapia,# # has killed himself with a bullet to the head.# # The body has been found on the soccer field # # across from the Capodichino airport.# And the shaving? Everything ready. Smoking is forbidden here. Damn! Now be still. It might hurt a little. But don't move. Does it hurt? Hello? Here is the producer of "Public Confessions". Yes, I'll do it. But we need to talk about the money. - 3 million? - For what do you take me? It's our standard contract. Why, do I seem to be the standard type? I've watched the program. It's all about the past. Do you have any idea of what I can tell about my past? We could offer 4 million. You can offer 6. Call me this evening. Listen, boys. We'll try something new today... One man up. Ok. Bye. President, Antonio Pisapia is here. Good evening. We'll finish it. Wait a moment. Welcome, Tony. I am Gigi. How are you? Fine, thanks. - Saverio, my man! - Hi, Tony, what's up? As you can see, kicking ass. Tony, what's this shit with your hair? Some bastard told me to use this fucking shampoo... - Let's take our places? - Sure! That's your seat. Tony, in a few moments we'll be on live. I have prepared some questions. Do you know that I used to sing here when you hadn't even been born? Singing has always been my dream. When I was a child, I remember my father used to get real mad... but I just sang more and more. He slapped me and I sang even more. I remember the stand mics. I remember Mina, Walter Chiari and Alberto Lupo. Alberto used to burst in laughs with me. I remember every stage where I stood, every song I sang, every dressing room... every flash from every photographer, every dedication on every album... the autographs, the tours, the restaurants, the laughs... every tear shed by every fan. I was born in Vico Speranzella. I remember Naples during the war. I was 8. I remember the bomb shelter under Augustea Square. And more... I remember I used to have... 6 smokings, 150 shirts, 90 pairs of shoes. I remember the first time I wore handcuffs... every tear I shed. How I cried every time they moved me from one prison to the other. When the wardens submitted me to the anal inspection. I remember every cellmate. I remember every time I had to lower my voice and every time I've been afraid to get on stage. I remember the flowers in the dressing rooms... the women outside the dressing rooms, eager to get closer to me. They used to find me interesting and it always ended in bed. They used to tell me I was handsome, but I never felt like being handsome. I felt like being mighty. I never gave a damn. I remember everything. It's bull shit what they say about the coke fucking your memory. I've been sniffing for 30 years and I remember everything. I remember all the coke I've sniffed. But everybody did it in those fucked up times. Who can say he didn't? Only the poor haven't done it. And they don't know what they've missed. I remember when I've sung in New York... and Frank Sinatra had to come by and listen to the phenomenal Tony. I remember my mother, when she was young. What can I say? She's still the most ravishing woman of my life. I remember a good friend, his name was Antonio Pisapia. He was a terrific soccer player. He wanted to become coach and they never let him do it. And thus he killed himself. But they'll never suicide me... cause I remember one more thing: I've always loved freedom. You don't have a fucking clue of what it means. I've always loved freedom. I'm a free man. - Hi, Carmine! - Hi, Tony! What's new? Life is shit, Aniello. Take care, Tony! I'll row till Capri! Tell me how it tastes. This film is dedicated to Tina and Sas?
