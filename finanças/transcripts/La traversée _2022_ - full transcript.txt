Here they are. You OK, guys? Put my bag there. C'mon, move it. Put it there. Who cares? Move it. We said 5 am. Only garbage men hit the street this early. Why not take the train? Quit whining. There are croissants inside. For real? Nope. What time will your friend get here? I dunno. Léa, feet off the seat. Alex? What's he doing here? My passport, my mother's permission, insurance papers. You're joking, right? Rayane, we haven't seen you for months. Almost a year of preparation without you and you just turn up? I'm a member of the association. You're my educator, right? Yeah, when it suits you. Sorry, but we didn't expect you. Aw c'mon, Alex... What? We're not going by plane. But... We could find a fix, share cabins... Get in the back. It'll be OK. Great. That's... No "Hello, sir, sorry I'm late..." She's something else! Gotta inspire a few rappers Sacem here, Sacem there And when I'm bored I make hits in five You no understand when me mad me no speak, eat instru for hours I'm polite and generous If you don't believe me ask your sis, nutter All my enemies love me It's worse than before, My face is everywhere, where, where! Hey! Sam. No! I'm King Kong, King, King Kong... Sam, you've been singing this song for two hours... Feel the pressure, guys? No way. I like rap, but... Samia, enough. Stop. Switch it off. Don't be a pain. Thanks. There. Let's listen to the radio. Great! Alex, that's too much. What is that? Is he for real? Gilbert Montagné, the French Stevie Wonder. Ah, Gilbert Montagné! Who's Stevie Wonder? I see, it's that bad. "Who's Stevie Wonder?" It's music for oldies! Yeah. This isn't '95. It's not for oldies. Sure it is. For oldies, man. I'm not that into it anyway. Pity, I love it. What do we say to Gilbert, guys? Yeah! I'm King, Kong! No! I'm King, King, Kong! I'm King Kong! I'm King, King, Kong! THE CROSSING Really? I'm gonna slap you, bitch! Why'd you say that? Calm down! My pussy stinks? Calm down! Look at me. No, I won't look at you! Did you hear what she said? What's going on? She told me to buy deodorant for my pussy. She gets mad about nothing. I can't leave you alone for five minutes! Shut the fuck up! Welcome to the zoo. This really is the zoo. Everything's fine, people. Stop! Everything's fine. Enough. I'll manage the shopping. Go see Rayane in the bus. OK. Mahdi, Polo, please. And now they're best pals. Mahdi, Polo, let's go. Don't look at me like that. What part of "let's go" do you not understand? Mister? Yes? You'll have to pay for the damage. No worries. They're just kids. I'm their educator. They're not bad kids. They're excited because we're going sailing for two weeks. Sailing? With them? Good luck with that! Hello. Squirrel Association, from Haÿ-les-Roses. We have a reservation with Nomad Company. Ah, that's good... This one yours? What's with him? He hasn't said a word all day. He doesn't know us. Guys like him don't do chatty. Did you think he was our dad? Who gives a shit? He has street cred, so they thought he was El Chapo! Hurry up, they're waiting. This is not a vacation, OK? It's an educational trip. So we're not allowed to laugh? We can't enjoy it? What did the guy say? So I carry everything? You off? I just heard they're here. What? You pissed? Yeah. If it's not kids, it's retirees, or old people, or seminars... When do I get some tail? Where's the hot chicks association? We'll have to find you one. Have a good trip, anyway. Let me through. I have stuff to do. Let go of me! Bye, man. Who let you in? What do you want? What's his problem? Wait, shhhh. Quiet, please. I'll handle this. Hello, sir, we're looking for Nomad Company. What for? We've hired a boat. We're the Squirrel Association. What? You're the Squirrel Association? Yes. Where are the squirrels? That? What's the problem? What is this? I'm not sailing with that lot. That's no way to talk! I see, so you're the skipper... Make no mistake, we're here to reintegrate these youngsters... That won't be possible. It's going to be very possible. No. Neither them nor me want to spend 15 days together. Know why? I was a cop for 10 years. What? I see. He's a cop. We're outta here. Thanks, bye. Hear that? He's a fucking cop. See? Wait, Steph. Wait. C'mon, let's go. Have a good day. Yeah, OK. Stéphanie, stop. Alright. Fine, sir. Thank you. Thank you. Well? I got the boss. He's adamant. It's him, or nothing. OK, let's go home. Stéphanie, that's ludicrous. We can't go home. Think about it. We've had investments, grants, authorisations... Who's going to pay that back? You? Me? You? We won't sail with a cop. No way. That's not how it works. They're right. We can't sail with a fascist pig. It's too much. We have no choice. What about me? I took skipper lessons for a year to get you the best program for this trip. D'you think I enjoyed spending my days off learning to sail, tie knots, read maps? To get you out of the concrete jungle and teach you the values of the sea. We get it, but no cop. For sure. Otherwise, no way. You see a cop, you panic? What's he talking about? No, Rayane, that's not it. I'm telling you, think what you like, but we're not going home. Your little "boss man" talk doesn't impress me. Stéphanie! He has a point. What does it say if we give up? We're not giving up. We are! No! Yes! So what? They win? They tell us what to do everywhere, all the time? Is that it? We have to apologize for existing? Because we bother the police? Because we're ashamed of who we are? Are you ashamed? Of myself, no. But Polo, yeah. What? You don't even have health care. What's the connection? Shut up, you're ridiculous. Don't you agree, Steph? Stéphanie, wait. Let me do the talking. What? You're taking us sailing, mister! Drop your voice! I'll drop nothing. Can we talk calmly here? No, we paid! We have rights. You don't decide when and what we do. Pull your sail out of your ass and let's go. - Cool it. Don't be so familiar! Don't speak to me like that. Or are you gonna shoot me? No one's getting shot. Get off my boat. Call his boss! Call his boss. No, Steph. What's she doing? Making the call. Hello, sir, Squirrel Association again. I'm calling because your skipper is still refusing to take us. Yes, one moment. Steph. Put me on speaker! Done. Can that idiot hear me? Yes. Loud and clear. Riton, are you there? Yes. Well, listen up. You dare to refuse my clients, on my boat? Look here, Riton, you're starting to really bust my balls! I'm sick of your crap. You kiss my ass to get an advance, then spend it all on the whores in the port! One came to bug me because you owe her 50 for a blowjob, and she's been trying to reach you for days. This sounds private, let's take it off speaker. No! He needs to understand that the clients' money pays for his blowjobs! I think he gets it. The customer is king. Dammit! Riton, are you still there? Yes. So get off your high horse and do what I pay you to do! I wish you all a great trip! Thank you. Thank you. We leave at 3 on the dot. Are we doing this? Yes, it's going to be fine. Be careful. The main danger on a boat is falling overboard. What does he take us for? Idiots? Take it easy. Seriously? No! No way! Oh no! I don't believe it! Look at his T-shirt. That's what he wants. Don't move. Thank you. Old guy. Everybody here? Let's go. Isn't there a pre-departure briefing? We're supposed to have a second skipper. It must be her. Ask her. No, it's me. A black skipper... Yes. Why not? I don't know the boat, you should do it. Or we could call your boss? That shut him up. Follow me. I love her. Mahdi, Polo, let's go! This is the kitchen. I've only got pork. I hope that's OK with everyone. This is the fridge. Got any coke? No. But you just have time to steal some if you're quick. The cabins are tiny, like prison cells. You'll feel at home. Showers... I doubt you're interested. We don't shit in the sea, so here's the toilet. Last thing, my boat is not a slum. Anything lying around will end up overboard. End of briefing. I swear I almost lost it. We won't last 15 days. I'm telling you. Insane. It's not insane. It's a motherfucker. I'll be back. Right. Stéphanie, he talks to us like we're dogs. This is shit. I know. We won't let him get to us. This is our crossing, OK? Riton? Can we use first names? No. You were hard on the kids. Stop right there. No first names, then? No. I've been kind enough to take you, but I won't be their buddy. They're kids, just turned 16. They look wild, but when you get to know them... Waste your own time. I did everything to avoid them. I gave up everything. Get back to your kids and colleague and see your folly through. What are they doing? We left five minutes ago. Don't you want to see? To see what? A boat setting off? Great. It's an important moment. Come up on deck. Hurry up. Come on! Get up there. You're not going to spend the whole trip inside. Come on now. Where are the others? Mahdi! Polo! What? What d'you mean, what? Get up here, we're waiting for you. We're setting off. Go down the side. To get up front. Have you seen Rayane? Yes, at the front. You OK? I'm having second thoughts about going with a cop. Don't worry, it'll be fine. We'll do some activities, chill out. We're here for the kids, right? Look how beautiful it is! Well? Are we off? Yes. This is it? It's crap, it's not even fast. It's lousy. Can't you just appreciate it? Some kids dream of this. For sure. Look, he's putting up the sail. It's beautiful. Look, look. What's his problem? Do we stink? I dunno. He hangs with the bad guys. He's on a mission for the Medellin cartel, in collaboration with the Haÿ-les-Roses cartel. "Hey Chico, wanna work for us?" Right, you're here to learn. This isn't a cruise. Take an interest, ask some questions. Will we see dolphins? What's so funny? I can ask a question, can't I? Will we? I don't know. Do you know? Mister, are there dolphins in the Mediterranean? Yes, there are. When do we see them? We won't. You'd do better to go to the aqua park. Don't speak to me like that! Just stop it! Calm down. Fuck him! Léa, calm down. She's insane! Piece of shit! Yes. C'mon, let's beat him up! Just back off, OK? No psychopaths on my boat! Don't blame her, she's bipolar. That's beside the point. This is no hospital. She should get help. Breathe. What's with you? Don't speak to me, I won't speak to you. OK? Don't worry, I won't. He nuts too? No. First, we don't say "nuts". We say "bipolar". That's not his problem. I'll explain... Yeah! She's lost it! Wacko! It makes you wanna shout! What are they doing? Being fuck-ups. What's the program? There is no program. What d'you mean? No activities? You're supposed to lead the workshops, it was in the blurb. I'm not a jail warden. So no workshops. You can't do this to me. It's catastrophic! Aren't you a skipper? Yes, but no... Well... What am I going to do with them? Dunno. Work it out. Don't insist, I won't do it. OK, fine. Jeez. Stéphanie? What's wrong? He won't do any activities. What? Perhaps you were right, maybe we should go back. Fuck him! We don't need him. You can do the activities. Why not? It's even better. Yeah! You're right. 'Course I am! Right... Do as you please today, get your bearings. You can... enjoy yourselves, admire the view. Do as you please. Mahdi, grab the corn. Don't just stand there. He was lying, it's not all pork. Where can I work? Move! I need space. There're too many people, it's driving me nuts. That's life on a boat. We're on top of each other, but we learn to live together. Here, put this on the table. You're not at home, everyone clears their own plate. We'll wash dishes in turn. We'll start with you, Léa. Jeez, why always me? Enough of the attitude. We'll spend a lot of time in the kitchen. It will forge the group. How long 'til we get to Morocco? We're not going to Morocco. We're going to Saïdia. A quick stopover. How long 'til we get there? 10 days. Why? I hope you're not planning anything dodgy. Nah, just 5 kilos to take back. Hilarious! Excuse me. He is so full of it! Sam, try not to get in everyone's way. OK? Here, take this. So this is what we're eating? You're joking, right? Knock it off! That pig screwed us with his racist supplies. Racist supplies? Yeah. Vegetables, tuna fish, tins of goodness knows what. OK, I get it. Leave it to me. A great chef can cook with anything. Set the table. I'm on this. I'll handle the kitchen. I can't take it anymore. There's not even any coke. Here we are, eating this crap. Don't hold back! I did what I could with what I had. It's perfectly edible. Stéphanie? What do you say? I want to puke. It's vile. I like it. Yeah, but you... Me what? Sam, stop that. I was joking. Even she laughed. Now she does, but later, she'll turn into... And Pablo Escrowbar, there? He eats alone as if we all had Covid. True. Why does he get special treatment? Because he has a complicated story. Yeah, but... What? They all have complicated stories. Thanks. His is super complicated. First time I saw him, he was 12. Single mother, totally overwhelmed. He was doing burglaries non-stop. In 30 years, I've not seen the like. 30 years? How old are you? I'm just out of my forties. You started at 10? I'm 52. I do sport, I wrestle, and I'm doing great. That's beside the point. We're talking about Rayane. He shouldn't be here. Yet he has a cabin to himself and we have to share. Yeah. Why can't he sleep with Stéphanie? No, no. No changes! It's all organized. You two sleep together. Léa with Sam. Nobody sleeps with Stéphanie. By the way, sex is strictly prohibited on this boat. What's this twisted association of ideas? I meant it for everyone. So I can't fuck Léa? Fuck your buddy. Good job you didn't say my name, bro. C'mon, you'd love it. I wouldn't touch you with a taser! Not even with a taser. Got it? What're you laughing at? Even the boat's dumping you. Stop laughing. You creep. You're the creep. You scream if anyone says "deodorant". Stop it. Alex, I'm gonna slap him. My plate on your head. C'mon, we're joking. Move your hand. Yes? Come in. You OK? Why do you want to see me? To debrief the first day. Get your impressions. Yeah, well... I dunno. I'm not giving up but when I think about what's ahead I think: "Jeez, a year to convince Town Hall, organizing this trip, hoping the kids will be inspired, and we end up with a fascist pig!° Are you even listening? No. I think you're dazzling. Come and see. Seriously, guys? We're not doing anything wrong, Steph. What don't you get about "ex-cop"? What about privacy? Yeah. I spot junkies like you from 50m. Give me your stuff. Lighten up! Hand it over. Don't make it worse. Or I could throw them overboard. Take it easy. Give him all you have. Major downer, wallah. Wallah? You're Portuguese! So? You're black but you speak French. Hurry up! You know how it goes, we've all been young. Sorry. Do we need to do a cavity search? No, we gave you everything. There's nothing else. We'll talk about this tomorrow. I'm so pissed. I didn't even get a toke. It was the first day. Stéphanie and I were just talking about it. We'll re-calibrate a few things. Don't worry. Tonight we'll all go to bed and tomorrow... Huh? To bed? What about the night watches? Night watches? Are you a skipper or not? What's the connection? What's a night watch? We rotate every four hours so I can sleep too. From 8 pm to midnight I took the helm, from midnight to 4 am, and 4 am to 8 am, it's you. But it's always us. I already did my watch. Who's at the helm now? I put it on autopilot. Why not use it all the time, so we can all sleep? How would we avoid storms? The Mediterranean Sea has storms too. Didn't they teach you that? I'm off to bed. What a jerk! What about the debriefing? No, I'm exhausted. Take those two. It'll freeze their asses, teach them a lesson. Good night. Good night. Good night. Mahdi, Polo! Sam! Get down! Are you insane? What are you doing up there? Get down, now. Get down! Move it! She's got balls. Come up, there's plenty of room. Stop it! Samia, get down, goddammit! What the hell? Hurry up, Samia. She was up there when I got here. This is messed up. I bet he let her go up there. C'mon, Sam. Yeah, one hand! D'you hear? Get down! If you two don't stop filming, your phones go overboard! OK. We got it. Put it on Insta. Sam, hurry up. There's no signal. What d'you mean? There's no signal. Cut it out! Seriously. What? No signal? Sam, hurry up! OK. Take it slowly. No, no! Nice and easy. Yeah, that's good. Happy? It wasn't me. They're out of control. No, they aren't. You just don't know them. Sure I do. Yeah? So what's her story? Never do anything like that again. She has a bunch of brothers who make her play tough so she can cross her ghetto... Not far off. She has four big brothers. Little clarification, though. Two are lawyers, one's a teacher and the other's a nurse. That's worse. She has no excuse. Like it or not, these kids are our future. Yours and mine. We're out of hot water! They'll tell me my pussy stinks again. What is this stunt? There is no way I'm washing in cold water! Shit boat! I've had it! Let's sit down. Everyone sit down. Sit down! Yeah. OK. There. There's no signal? I can't call my mother. Stop it. You don't give a shit about your mother! Quit lying. No. The Carrick bend. The knot... extremity... Simple knots. Alex, where's this activity? A knot workshop. It's complicated. Do you have any idea when we could start? There's over 100 knots and they all look alike... We don't need to know them all. Let's just focus on the most important ones. Can I have some peace? Yes, but... We're bored silly! Shit. I'm preparing a program, it's nearly done. Too slow. We could die twenty times while we wait. There's no signal, no dope, nothing to do. It's worse than the hood. I'm seasick and my T-shirt's disappeared. Can't we go swimming while we wait for the workshop thingy? I don't know... Excuse me, can the kids go in the water? Sure. OK, into your swimsuits. But they'd better swim fast cos I won't stop. Or swim a long time. Say, 10 days. I'll pick them up on the way back. He thinks he's funny. Yeah. OK, let's forget this knot activity thing. We'll do it later. C'mon, let's improvise. How about fishing? Why not? Cos it's lame. No, it isn't! Yes, it is. Why not? I'd planned to do that on day two, anyway. Do you have fishing rods? No. No fishing rods. We don't need him, he's useless. Don't you get that? We have ropes, we can make a net and catch some fish. Yeah, but to make a net, we need to know knots. Not complicated ones. It'll be fine. Let's get started. We make a net, catch a fish and we avoid the disgusting food we had to eat yesterday. Rayane, come and join us. No, I'm good. You decided to come with us. You can't go solo all the time. C'mon. C'mon. Move over. C'mon. Do you have...? Here. Right. Well, now... Go for it. What do we do? Rayane's with us, that's a good thing. The important thing for a fishing net is what we call a "sheet bend". We should have a frame to do clove hitches but we have no wood. We'll manage without a frame. Just show us the knots. I'm looking for an easy way to explain. Fine, Alex. But don't overthink it. Show us and we'll copy you. OK. OK. Right... So, er... like this, and hup. Then... Wait. If you leave knots in there... There. Right. Give me that! Yeah. A sheet bend won't do. You need clove hitches to join them. How about I do the sheet bends, you do the clove hitches? I can manage. OK. Watch closely. That's a sheet bend. Jeez, I don't have a clue. I get it. If one of you miraculously does a sheet bend, then you have to join them with a clove hitch. There. That makes the mesh of the net. You do that for the whole net. Impossible. For you, yes. Here, colleague. Thank you. Thank you, right? C'mon. If he can do it, so can we. I so wanna do her! Concentrate! We are. Sam! Help Rayane, he's struggling. What? I don't wanna take a stray bullet. Boys, what did I say? Show some enthusiasm. I'm exhausted. Stay focused. And you just clap your hands? I think that's it. Just watch me clap my hands. But guys, why did you make a strip? We need a square. We do? It's a net, not a lasso. Don't tell me we have to start over? No way! We are not giving up! Yes, she's right. You don't give up at the first obstacle. Get to it! Jeez, what a pain! I won't do it. Let's go. Mahdi, get up and I will destroy you. Same for all of you. Move and I'll wipe you out! OK? We started this job, we see it through. OK, let's start over. Yay! We did it! Where is he? The net! The net! The net! Come out. Where's the net? Yeah! We made the net! Well? We throw it on three, OK? Careful. C'mon! One, two, three! At last! Thank you. Well done! We did it. But how do we pull it back in? You have to tie the net to a cleat. What's that? I was almost... But no. You just never disappoint. You should thank me, I found you a job. Dammit! Léa, calm down. Things are tense enough. Why pick on me? Why don't you get at him? The net! The net! He doesn't even defend us. What? So what do we eat this evening? Rayane could at least eat with us. This is even worse than yesterday. What will tomorrow bring? It's great. Yeah, it's cool. Dead right! Yeah? How's it going? Heavy mood on the boat, huh? Yeah. So we were wondering... What Alex said about having sex and all that. Yeah? No signal, no fish, no net... Get to the point. We weren't talking to you, but to Léa. Yeah, and...? We were wondering if it was possible to... Seriously? You wanna fuck me? Not at all! It was his idea. Clowns like you? No, it was yours. You said: "Let's go see them." Lousy liar. Get out, you jokers. You spin a tale then back out. "Let's go talk to the girls..." "I know how to talk to them." "I can do it." Look at them! I'm shocked. Jokers! The guy's just out of diapers! He's got a nerve. Give him some calcium. You take your shower here? Yes. Watch out for the kids. You in a swimsuit is sure to excite them. It's not as if I'm doing it in front of everyone. But Riton is at the helm. I don't give a fuck. I for one think you're radiant. Look Alex, last time in the cabin was a little... Now you stare at me with googly eyes. So what if I find you sublime? What about your wife and kids? What's the connection? We slept together one time. It was great. But if you brought me on this boat to... Excuse me? Yeah. If you take me for a guy like that, I can tell you right away we're not off to a good start. Good. Can I finish my shower? Yes. Fine by me. Super. At least it's clear now. Great. Look, Stéphanie, I'm glad we've got that sorted. Everything OK? Don't bother, you won't fuck me either. Hello, girls. And boys. So what did you do last night? They hooked up together, right? Sure you did. Fancy steering today? Take the helm? Why aren't you speaking to me? Go talk to the asshole, and leave us alone. What did you say? She said go suck him! Take that back! Yeah, right. Right, punishment for everyone. Clean the boat. Yeah, right. Go fuck your mother. I won't do it. Say that again. I'm not sure I heard right. Speak like that again and it won't go well. C'mon, Steph. No! He asked you to clean the boat. So do it. You're going to... Clean the boat. And apologize on your way out. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Don't you have anything to clean? I said: "Don't speak to me, I won't speak to you." Wise-ass... You OK? Never do that again. Never humiliate me in front of my kids again. You're undermining my authority. What is this? I wanted you to know. End of discussion. No. As we're having a moment of truth, you played me for a fool! I did? How? All that stuff about skipper training, half-days off for lessons, while I did all the work with the kids. What the hell were you doing? And the way you blabbered on about this trip, the great values of the sea, when all you want to do is fuck me. What? How dare you? I've been doing this for 30 years. You just got here. Save your sermons, Miss! Back down, OK? Those perky little tits and firm butt, don't change anything. So back down. And the kids in all this? Where do they fit between my tits and my ass? I think you've forgotten why you do this job. Want more? No way I'm eating that. C'mon on, come and eat with us. I'm not hungry. OK. He says he's not hungry. So you're an outcast now? I've got a signal! No way! Yeah, big time. I've got a signal, bro! Wait. What're you doing? Looking for my shoes. They disappeared yesterday. The signal's back! Yeah! We have a signal! I don't give a shit. Where are my shoes? Who cares? If this is about yesterday, I forgive you. We have a problem. Look at your phone. Rayane, what is this? The association left us 20 messages. Your mother's hysterical. Did you run away? Of course not. She knows where I am. She doesn't want me to go to Morocco. She doesn't even give a shit about me. Why did she call from? Yeah, but we can't go against your mom's will. I know it's complicated with her, but you're still a minor. I can't take the responsibility of taking... Explain, Rayane. It's none of your business. Actually, it is. It's none of your business! Rayane, calm down. What're you going to do about it? Huh? Listen up. If I tell you to take me to Morocco, you do it. OK? This is nonsense. Do you understand? Rayane! Let go of me! Let go! What? Let go of me, asshole! Calm down. Let him go! Let go of him. What? Rayane... Talk to us. What's in Morocco? My father! Happy now? My father. I thought you didn't know him. I don't care. I just wanna live in Morocco. With my dad. I'm sick of the hood, of having no cash. I don't wanna live with my mom. We can't help you run away. What you're asking is impossible. Let me go and see him, just once. He lives in Saïdia. I'm begging you. I see him and we come straight back. What does it matter to you? We should go straight back now, turn right around. I could lose my job. I get it, you want to see your dad, but... No! What? Nobody got anything to say? Right, Riton, how long to get to Morocco and back? Riton? Yes? How long to get to Morocco and back to Marseille? Seven days. What if you go fast? Seven days. OK. Rayane, just to be clear: you see your dad, and we leave. You have my word. I'll call the association and tell them. I'll lie and say that we're on our way, and it'll take 7 days. It's done. I told my boss we'd be right back. They'll figure out that I'm messing with them. I don't get it. You'd risk your job for a thug who almost beat you up? We don't live in the same world. In my world, you don't abandon lost cases. That's how it is. Did you see the state he was in? Didn't it touch you? What's the worst that can happen? I get fired, like you? I wasn't fired. You weren't? Spending too much time with thugs makes you go wacko. I wanted to get out before I messed up. I didn't get fired. I quit. I hate to say so, but I'm getting used to this. I can't do everything! Be a good cook and a great educator. Great educator? Yeah. Any other educator would have turned back. You know, I haven't forgotten why I do this job. Excuse me. You OK, El Chouino? Sam. He has to know we shoot live ammo here. We shoot. I forgive her. I heard she was born in a hair salon. "I'm a big shot, I'm gonna see my dad." Take off that wig! What wig? This is no wig. Ah, it's a wig! I didn't notice. Moron! Is it real hair, or a wig? Polo, you're so dumb! It's not a wig! It's her real hair? Dumbass! Could you keep it down? After 10 pm, it's called "disturbing the peace". Stay, mister. Come and chat. If not for him, Rayane would have beaten Alex up. You have to be fair in life. I don't need you to accept me. Just turn down the jungle music. "Jungle music"! That's colonial speak! You're just ignorant is all. It's rap, man! That's rap? Yeah. Nah, that's not rap. Sam, switch it off! I didn't hear right. You know rap? Look, you kids have your music, we have ours. OK? No, I don't listen to your old folks music. If that's the rap you listen to... I get why you're lost. Is he for real? What d'you mean, lost? Let Mr Cop explain to us what rap is. Let's hear the Police view on the topic. You think you invented rap? Who said that? A rapping cop? What d'you rap? Crrrr... rap? They rap tickets, bro, and if you don't like it, they tase or fine you. They hold concerts in prison vans. And the audience are all snitches and racists. And their vids air on "Bring in the Accused." Good one! So now we laugh with the cops? We're having a good time together. At the outset, this trip was organized to expose you to new stuff, stuff you're not used to seeing and hearing. And so... I have a classic for you. No, Alex! Yes. Isn't that the lousy music we heard in the bus? Steve Français? Stevie Wonder. Stop, it's not bad. Are you serious? Well, actually... What? It's dull as hell. Come on! That's the Great Bear. What's that? A constellation. It looks like a pot. Why is it called "Bear" then? You're right. I don't know. So Rayane, you've never seen your dad? Léa, that's private. I have a right to ask. I don't mind. No, I don't know him. Did he abandon you at birth? Leave your mother? I don't know if he knows I exist. Dirty. Your mother tricked him into having a baby. Watch your language, Polo. No, he's right. She always told me that he was dead. But he's not. How did you find out? She confessed one night, when she was wasted. Jeez, that's tough. Knock it off. Rayane, I know your mother, she's a fine woman. She's doing her best. Maybe she's right. Maybe his father's a jerk. Mahdi! You can't say stuff like that. What? You have coke! There! Take it easy, there! He hid it well. Do it yourself! I said "please". Quit whining. You're always whining. That's why he's fat. I knew he didn't just eat veggies. Any chance of a beer? Sure, with a fellatio on the side? What are you laughing at? I drink anything. You don't know what it means, do you? No. I don't. Fellatio, man. Forget the beer. Take one, Rayane. Another beer? No, I'm good. I don't know how you hold up. So, you have lawyer brothers? It puts a lot of pressure on her. Not surprising she dropped out. Shut up, you! What does your family do? MPs, solicitors? No. But I have an uncle who touched me up as a kid. But I'm fine, it was 8 years ago. And you? Did you really quit because you almost messed up? Léa! Yes, it's true. What happened? Are you really interested? Yes. I was on a mission in the projects, a colleague was driving. We don't know what happened, but we ended up surrounded by 15 youths beating on the car. My buddy panicked. He plowed through the kids. Damn. Great. Nobody died, but it was the last straw. I quit rather than end up like my colleague, who got fired. You cops act like cowboys. Kids get killed, or controled all the time. I once had my ID checked 17 times between 9 am and 8 pm. 17 times in one day! How come you were there all day long? Maybe taking skipper lessons. The youngsters are right: pick your side. I saw the youngsters grow up. I knew them all by name, their love stories, their parents, I played football with them. Then overnight, those same kids lose the plot and start firing fireworks at you forgetting that you're human too, that you have a wife and children... You have kids? Are you married? I don't have kids and my wife left me. Why? Because... Lots of reasons. Maybe... it's not easy to live with me. I dunno. I understand her. Do you still love her? Sure, but that's not the point. Tell her, then. Call her. Yeah. Call her, Riton. Seriously, call her. The signal's back. Now's the time. The perfect time. It's not that simple. We haven't spoken for 4 years. So what? You have to call her. Maybe that's what she's waiting for. For sure. If you still love her, call. Go on. Call her. You'll regret it otherwise. Do it. Go on! Don't worry. What do you have to lose? Call her, Riton. There you go! Who's up to dive into the sea right now? You're exhausting! All alone. On your own. He's nice after all. No, he's drunk. Where are my shoes and my T-shirt? Why the hell would I want them? You're not even the same size. Who then? I wanted to thank you for the song. I appreciate it. I didn't do it for you. Any coke left? There must be a ghost on board. Well? She's remarried and super happy. She said to go fuck myself. Sorry. We're bastards, but we're sorry. There are plenty more fish in the sea. Never mind. At least you have the boat. It didn't leave. It never will. It will never leave you. The boat will stay! It'll stay on the water. What are you doing? You said there were dolphins in the Mediterranean. Yes. I feel a connection with them. Don't believe me, huh? I'm used to it. Nobody ever believes me. Everyone thinks I'm crazy. Excuse me, could we talk? I believe you. Notice anything? Look. The boat's not moving. There's no wind. How long will it last? Until the wind rises again. But how long? Now, in an hour, a few days... A few days. What about the mother? Don't you have an engine? It's a sailing ship. The engine won't get us to Morocco. We have to wait. Be patient. Contemplate, do some heart-searching, try to reconnect with nature. I don't give a shit! I have a deadline. I have kids, it's been three days... Did you slap me? No, you weren't thinking straight. That's police violence. Great weather for a swim, right? We're going for a swim. Don't slip! It's amazing. Sam, come in the water! Later. No, now! Come on! Jump! I bet she can't swim. 'Course I can swim. So come. You can swim? Dive in, then! I have nothing to prove to anyone. It's 'cos of her fake hair. You're killing me! Go fuck yourselves! Aw, c'mon! Come on in. She's really pissed. I think I preferred you in airplane mode. Sam? She's sulking. We're joking, Sam. I just read page 155. Once, there was no wind for 3 weeks. 21 days! I'll definitely be arrested for kidnapping. Sam. Open up, please. Sam? What's up? Nothing. I don't feel like swimming. Stop it. You climb 15 meters up the rigging but you don't want to swim? What's the problem? You don't know how to swim? You can say so. Of course I can swim. So what is it? There is no problem! Scared to be seen in a swimsuit? Rubbish. What would happen? Who cares what the guys, or the girls, or anybody thinks? Listen to this ex-fuck-up, if you give in to that you'll miss out on so much. You were fucked up? Big time. Shall we do it? Sure? Go ahead! Go ahead, you'll see. Bring it on. Sexy! You look amazing, girls. Eyes down, you two. All right, all right... Ready? OK! No way! Look out, Sam, I'm coming! C'mon, let's go swimming. I'm coming! Come on, Rayane! Hurry up! Jump in with us. It's so good! C'mon Rayane! Here I come. No! He's sulking too. Oh, no. Mahdi wants looking after. Thanks you. Makes a change! What's this? A rope? Ah, it's your hair... What's going on? The wind's back. What're you doing? Taking a crap. Fine, but the wind's back. We're late so we'd better go. Mind if I finish my crap? Go ahead. But if the wind drops again... Give me a break, will you? We're really late. Anyone want to do the shift with me? Rayane? OK. Can I come too? If you like. Right. What's with you? If he gets beaten up, I don't wanna miss it. Take the helm. If you want to see your father, stay on course. But be careful, one millimeter to the right, you end up in Spain. And to the left... Algeria. If you must deviate, go right. I know you're going to screw them. You'll stay in Morocco. He just wants to see him! Even that's dumb. Why d'you say that? When you turn up in a guy's life, who probably has a family, who doesn't even know you, it can only stir shit up. For nothing. He has a right to know his father, know where he comes from. Yeah, in fairy tales, and dumb TV shows. Not only. You'll be disappointed. In life, you should appreciate what you have rather than dream about what you don't have. Great pep talk, guys! Rayane! Rayane! What d'you want? Yes, yes... No, wait for us. We can't go any faster, the wind's dropped. Yes, I'll call you... Dammit! Everything OK? No. The head of the association is furious. The return isn't going to be easy. I admire what you did for Rayane. I thought you did it to impress me but... you're a nice guy, Alex. Thanks, I'm touched. Quit pretending, we all know what's going on. Seriously? Yeah, I swear. What a relief! I wasn't sure what to say, I didn't know if you liked him. What? I'm not into guys. Have you...? Stop it. Are you serious? Me and the girls are going with Rayane. Got the address, Rayane? Yes, on my phone. Sure you don't want to come? Me and fellatio here are going on a tour of the port. Stop calling me that! Let's go. Hey, thanks for everything you've done. You're welcome. We'll be back this afternoon. All good? Yes. Everything OK? Yes, I'm fine. You don't look fine. I'll finish up here and we'll head into town. Hurry, we have to get back before the others. It's here. What's wrong? You're getting me down. "Nice guy". What? Stéphanie, she told me I was a "nice guy". And that's a bad thing? Would you fuck a nice guy? There you go! What? I'm 65? To be called a "nice guy"! Don't get so worked up. Wait. You did all this to get a bit on the side? Of course I did. A black skipper... even you said it makes no sense. I don't like the sea! I don't like fish, or salt, or waxed jackets. The kids are right, the sea is boring. That woman is Sheitan, she's a demon! I know what you have to do. You do? Go on deck at sunset, breathe deeply and stare at the horizon. Let the spray of the waves beating against the hull lull you. And invoke the mermaids. Mermaids make everything fly away. Your worries, fears, doubts. Nothing matters anymore. How do you invoke them? Whack yourself off. For real! Really go at it, otherwise it doesn't work. Why did I even tell you? Mermaids! It's OK, I'm left-handed. I think that's it. I'd rather go alone, if you don't mind? No, we understand. Rayane? I know you won't come back. He wasn't there. Shall we look for him elsewhere? No, let's go back. My mother had me when she was 14. She wasn't ready. I made her life hell. Know what? Since we stopped talking, I regret it every day. You should call your mother. Here they come. Did it go well with your dad? Yeah. Thank you. He didn't see him, but he's called his mother and it's settled. That's great! Yeah. Great. All that for a call we could have made 3 days ago. I'll lose my job. Everything is just great! You're being a jerk. Yeah, I'm a jerk. Riton did some shopping. Way out! It's for the whole trip. If it's gone in two days, it's your problem. More like two hours! Hey bro, what's up? There must be a ghost or something. What? They were in my closet, brand new. This boat is weird. Weird. What are you going on about? Shut up. We're changing direction! We're taking a little detour. Thanks. Sam, come here. What? What's that? Dolphins! Dolphins! Léa! Look! Léa, there are dolphins! Where? Look! Look! Look! Out of this world! Look! Man, look at that one! No way! Cool! Over there. Look! There are tons! Look at that one! It's insane, look over there! Look, look! It's a procession! Look! Come on, come on. I've got it! Did you get that? Look! Beautiful! Look! Over there too! Got any bread to draw them in? What're you talking about? What do dolphins eat? Wait, wait. How did you do that? I'm connected. That's dumb luck, or witchcraft, pal. Do it again! What's wrong? You're just pissed because the dolphins ignore you! It's weird, man. She does that and they rise up. Look. Get ready. You have to know how. Go on. Wait. Do it again! Mahdi, Mahdi! Never mind, Mahdi. Go on, Polo, you try. Grab it, we're gonna eat it all. Out of the fridge, come and navigate. We're coming, we're starving. It's not normal to be so hungry. By the way, I know you bought those new things. You threw them in the sea. I'm onto you. So you don't believe in ghosts anymore? I'm done with that! Move it, the others are waiting. Don't eat that. Ghost my ass! This is great. Where's the navigation lesson? What's going on? We're waiting for the lesson. This is going on. What is it? Whose is this? Theirs! All of you! I knew I shouldn't trust you. Calm down. We'll talk to them. Steph? I'm gonna smash you up. No more talking. Who are you calling? The police. What? No! Riton, please. Don't do it, we're sorry. Don't rat them out. We're sorry. Please, stop. I'm calling the coast guards. You can go to Moroccan prison, it'll be fun. No! We try to get you out of trouble. We take you to a beautiful country and all you do is buy dope? Where did you get it? It's a guy from back home. He has a pal there who does some business. We wanted to get into it. Do you realize what you've done? How serious this is? Riton, did we turn around? Riton? Are you OK? Laxists. Fucking laxists. Guys like you are the problem. You forgive everything. They buy drugs and you cover it up! Where are you going? Back to Morocco. I can't let this go. They have to answer for their acts. We'll manage this ourselves. They've learned their lesson. You don't get it. You are the problem! Let go! Enough, turn back. Let go of that bag! Let go! Stop, goddammit! Stop! Calm down! Rayane! Rayane! Shit, Rayane! What's happening? Rayane fell, it's his fault! What's going on? What's happening? Can you see him? No! We can't help, Alex! Dive, Alex! Dive! I can't see him! Go on! Again, Alex! Again! I've got him! Get back here, Alex. A little further. Come on, come on! Don't let go! Help me! Riton! Come on, pull! Move it. Move aside. What's happening? Fuck. Fuck! It's going to be OK. Come on, Rayane! Please... Carry on, please. Keep it up, please. Goddammit! Do it, Alex. Keep at it! Come on! Rayane! Stop, Alex. Stop. No! Keep going! Let him do it! Stop. Stop, it's too late! Stop! No, no! Come on! Come on! Thank you. Is Rayane OK? Don't worry. He's in his cabin, resting. Here, thanks. What do we do with those two idiots? Shall I talk to them, or you? Do they really get it? Riton is going to talk to them. You wanted to see us? Where did you get the money? Our savings from the past year. And the dope? Where were you going to hide it? His place. My place? There's six of us in my room! My mom's a cleaner, she inspects everything. Let's suppose you know where to hide it. Did you think about the local drug lords? Who grab you then torch you in the basement... Imagine it. Two kids, 40 kilos soaking wet, who start selling on their turf. What d'you think will happen? I was a cop for 10 years, I know a thug when I see one. And you aren't. So forget it. It's not for you. Trust me. OK. But, just to be sure, do we get the dope back or not? Yeah, how about it? It's always like this? All year round. Enough, get back to your cabins. Good night, Riton. They're dumb, these kids. But in reality, what did you do with the dope? You too? I threw it overboard. I was just wondering. Are we buddies now? Yes. Right, I'm off. Do you want me to do your shift? No, you get to bed. More tea? Yes, please. First one! Check! Sleep well? Yes. Good. I wanted to tell you, you were amazing yesterday. Don't exaggerate. I just took care of one of my kids. Right, it's on autopilot. Stay on course. I'm going to wake the others. There you go. Up and at it! Everybody up! Up you get! Get up! Let's make the best of our last few days! Oh, no. Don't look at me like that. It was more of an assault. When she says "fuck the police", she's not joking! What are we doing today? I dunno, I'm going to lie down. Darling, I miss you very much. I can't wait to see you again. I don't even have a signal. That's mine. It's the last one. Take them all. There's one more. Who's is that? Mine. Your bag's there. Mahdi, Polo, got everything? Yeah. You're sure? Yeah! Is that everything? Right... Well... It's not exactly how I imagined it, but... it was great. Right? Yeah! It was way out. Thanks, Riton. Yeah, not bad at all. We've got some driving to do. Say goodbye to Riton. There! Take care of yourself. Let's go! Haÿ-les-Roses awaits! Let's go! Bye, Riton. Bye, Riton. And Alex? Yes? Don't forget the mermaids. What's that about? No idea. I hate saying goodbye. Me neither. Can we come back? Yeah. If I still have my job. As if you they'd fire you. You never know. I told them: "With me, the kids come first. I'd do the same again. If you don't like it, I quit." That's what I said. Liar! I heard you on the phone. He begged to keep his job, on his knees. No! I swear. He's nuts. He shouted: "Give me a reprimand but don't fire me." Hey, you can't speak to me like that! Did you tell them you did all this just to get into my panties? Well, well...
