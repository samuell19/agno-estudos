Hello, Anna. How are you doing? Fightin' 'em off, Noah. Fightin' 'em off. Somebody threw a rock through uncle Ben's window and pinched a pair of binoculars. Any comments? I came across the bridge. I have nothing against uncle Ben. It's too dark to pitch rocks. That's the one thing I need, binoculars. And cops are not my favorite people. Take it easy. That's the talk, Anna. Hi, Blanche, why don't you give the man back his binoculars? Of all the back-handed remarks. That's what I'm always telling you about her, eddy. You never know where you stand with her. He knows where he stands. Both of you better watch your step if you want to stand in good with me. Where is everyone tonight? The streets are like graveyards, houses like tombstones. Everything's slowed down to a stop. When your train is going too fast, god puts the brakes on to give you a chance to think. I don't want to think, I want to drink. Do it again. You ain't paid for the first one, baby. Ain't my credit good? With me, sure. But I've got the landlord to think of. Take out for the first one, Noah, and leave the bottle. I'm choosey who I drink with. Some people have absolutely no manners. I'll take a rum cola, Noah. Let her have it, Noah. Thanks, eddy. But drink it right here at the bar. Oh, don't let me spoil the party. This is for the party. Such a mercenary atmosphere. How about a little conversation? Converse. How you been? It worries you, huh? Yeah, I've been thinking about you. You know, I've been watching you for over a year now. How am I doing? You get along with the fleet, but so far they haven't named any ships after you. I don't mix with admirals. Look, I run an exclusive place uptown. We don't cater to sailors in my place. Just captains of industry. I'll dress you up in the right clothes, and you'd look natural on the arm of some tired businessman. What do I have to do? Be a hostess. You can talk plainer than that. That's all. Like I said, my club is real exclusive. No rough stuff. You just sit and drink with the customers. Rake-off on every drink. Of course, you'd have to learn how to smile a little. What goes with the smile? Mingle, like you do down here. Except you get paid for it. Get paid for what? So far you haven't said anything. Look, I run an exclusive club. What's different about your place makes it so exclusive? For one thing, the law won't bother you. You've got it made. Mmm-hmm. Yeah, I'm coming up in the world. Not in mine. I'd like to remedy that. What's your prescription, doctor? Me. I'm not all business. I take a little pleasure myself once in a while. Now, working in my place, it's only natural we'd spend a little time together. I'd rather do time than spend it with you. That's what your need. A couple of years softening up in the can. You're scaring me to death, louse. Now I'm getting mad. Ow! You rotten little bum! What'd she do to you, eddy? Burned me on the neck with her cigarette. He almost tore my arm off. Well, now you know where you stand with each other. I'm not wastin' my time with no waterfront tramps. Well, excuse me for livin'! Not you, but you. Better change your mind and stop being so particular. Someday you may need a pal. I'd rather pal with rats. Keep it up, and you will. Are you gonna stick around here all night? Well, you don't have to get so tough about it. I'm only going to stay for a little while. Gee, my feet are killing me. You got a smoke? You know they still sell 'em in every drugstore. Yeah, I know. But I'm cuttin' down on tobacco. Gives me the heartburn. Thanks, kid. Hey, Noah, I'm dyin' for a drink. I'm dyin' for a cash customer. Hey, Noah. How'd you like to buy a nice pair of binoculars? Go ahead and take a look through 'em. See what you could see. Without looking through 'em, I can see from 1 to 10 at hard labor. Give 'em back to uncle Ben. I didn't break that window. And I didn't steal no binoculars, either. I was wlkin' down the street, mindin' my own business, and there was that hole in the window and the binoculars sittin' right there on the edge. They fell in my hand. I found 'em. Hey, Anna, do you think there's a reward for findin' lost articles? I'd sure like to be found. Yeah. Gee, you look a million miles away. Get lost, will you? Get lost. I was only tr yin' to cheer you up. Stay in the dumps. Who cares? Hey, where you gonna sleep tonight? Why should I tell you? All right, be huffy. I don't care where I sleep. You better go on home, Anna. I'm locking up. Here's a couple of sandwiches for the road. What about something to wash 'em down with, Noah? Here, get yourself a cup of coffee some place. Do you know where a lady can sleep for 4 bits? Sell anything today, Frank? Well, yes and no. Had a couple of very interesting prospects, Stanley. Yeah, but did you sell anything today? You know, you have a nasty habit of reducing everything to money. That's what I'm talkin' about: Money. Did you take in any? You make money your god and it'll plague you like the devil. I'm plagued with all the junk you got cluttering up this yard. Hey, give me a hand with this. You have absolutely no imagination. Can't you see this is a treasure trove of antiques? I say it's junk. Yes, but don't you know when junk gets old enough, it becomes antique? Now you take this little masterpiece, for instance. Now I can't leave this out all night. Might tempt some honest man to become a thief. Hello, darling. Hi, Stanley. Did you have a hard day? You said it. Monday's always a back-breaker. I know. You sit over on the couch. I'll help you with your slippers. Stella, look at that rip. Every time I raise my arm, it tears again. Take it off. I'll sew it up. Well, you sewed it up yesterday. I'll patch it from the inside. You're getting careless in more ways than one. How many times have I told you to wash your hands after handling that junk? What for? Dirt never hurt nobody. It's healthy. All that stuff about dirt and germs is just a lot of bunk. Ain't it, Frank? Hey, ma, hurry up with the dinner, will you? I'm starved. Oh, Frank, special delivery came for pa today. I saved the government 15 cents by bringing it up myself. When congress hears about this, I'm sure we're gonna get a tax cut. I'll take it up to pa. Why ain't he down here? It's time to eat. He's got another one of his headaches. Headaches. He's got a hangover. It's more than that. He's got some kind of psychosis. Psychosis, bunk. He just likes to hit the bottle. That's not true. Hey, wait a minute. Who's that letter from? Hey... hey, who'd have anything to write to Joe that was special delivery? It's from Bessemer, Alabama. Probably one of his old cronies puttin' the bite on him. All folks down south think California's the gold country. Well, he ain't gonna get any of my money to send to those Alabama Hicks. That's easy, you ain't got none. You little nickel snatcher. Look, I got a business, eh. I put the money I make back into the enterprise. Enterprise? Don't make me laugh. You just use that not to take a job. Well, I'll ignore that unkind remark and tell you why I wouldn't give the old man a dime to send to Alabama. Why? It's the principle of the thing. Everyone's got to make their own way. That's democracy, everyone for himself. That ain't democracy. Democracy is, "all for all and one for one." And you're the one. I was until you had to go and make it 2. It ain't a question of democracy. It's a question of pampering people. Nobody never got nowhere with pamperin'. You take us, for instance. Now where'd we be if we'd stayed down in Alabama? Where do you think we are now? In California. What's that got us? I don't know where it got you. I know where it's gonna get me as soon as this tight money situation eases up. You just try walking out on me. Ain't that a woman for you? Always makin' the thing personal. Where was I? Easin' the money situation. Oh, yeah. The country ain't never going to balance the budget as long as they keep on givin' stuff away. Now, you take this here new thing, this here foreign giveaway program. Do you think that's right? Sure that's right because I heard a guy... Who the hell is telling this thing, me or you? Me. That's how much you know. I heard a guy ta"in' only last night... Now you see? You see? What's the use? Trouble with you is, you listen to too much ta... Trouble with me is, I listen to too much you. Listen, now if you really want to know why we shouldn't send money to those southerners, I'll tell you. Why, Frank? Because it's pamperin'. When they get hungry, they'll find a way to eat. And the only way to eat is to work. And the only ones who eat without workin' is the politicians. And just as soon as this country gets back on its feet again, that's just what I'm gonna be: A politician. And that's when the country will really be on its butt. Eh, I sure did marry beneath me. That's another trouble with the world today: Women. Hey, ma, when are we gonna eat? Now. If you don't get some solid food inside you, instead of all that candy, you'll give birth to a chocolate marshmallow. Dinner's ready, Joe. We're waitin' for you. All right, Theresa. I figured it was about time. Thank you, Katie. Did you have a nice nap, honey? I got a little sleep. Well, you're feelin' all right, then. No, Theresa, I feel terrible. Every time I try to read this letter, the words just jiggle around like bugs. Here, you read it for me, Katie. Of course, Joe. Are we gonna hold up my dinner for this mess? I want everyone to keep quiet and listen to it because it's from my old friend, Otis Slocum, and it's bound to be good. If he wants our old clothes, he's out of luck. We got 'em on. Shh, let Katie read the letter. "My dear friend Joe Lucasta, I hope you are fine and rich in California." Here it comes. "I just sold my farm because the doctor says "I work too hard and got to take it slow "and stay off my feet from here on. "All my boys and girls got married, all except Rudolf. Rudolf's getting painfully restless for a woman." Tell him to take a cold shower. Shut up, Stanley. Read on, Katie. "Good healthy women are scarce down around here "owing to so many of the young folk "leaving this part of the country. "So I gave Rudolf his share of the farm "so he can get himself a good wife" "when he comes west. He's bringing $4,000, Joe." "And I want you to pick him a good, strong woman, "clean and god-fearing. "I know you will do this, for old times' sake. "So bless you, Joe, and be good to my boy Rudolf. Otis Slocum." What does that farmer think? You can buy a woman like you buy a pig? Sometimes pigs is a better buy. When are we gonna eat? I'll bring you yours in a trough. $4,000. That's a whole lot of money for a jerk to be carryin' around. Yeah, really too much. $4,000 is a lot of money. We need it bad. Frank, you can't stoop that low. Well, if he's willing to pay for a woman and we get him one, we ain't cheatin' him, are we? It's business. That's what it's like. Yeah, and I gotta get a whole new wardrobe after the baby comes. And we gotta get a new bed for Stella and me. I'm tired of nailin' that thing together in the middle of the night. This family could use a second car. There's a swell Ford down at the used-car lot for only $800. It's convertible, too. Stop it! Stop spending Otis Slocum's money. I won't let you. Well, you ain't got it yet. Besides you don't have to do nothin'. We'll do it ourselves. I said, no! He just said you don't have to do nothin'. If we don't get it, somebody else will. What chance has a dumb son of a gun got keepin' that kind of money in this town? Don't let them do anything. It's disgusting. We ought to be able to get some real nice girl for Rudolf. All the girls I know are married or got kids. There's Irene's sister. But ever since she went to San Francisco, she wouldn't look at no farmer. How about Tom's daughter? What the devil's going on here? Give me some meat. He'd pay us to take her off his hands. Who did you say, Stanley? Tom's daughter. Say, by George, you've got somethin' there. She'd take anything in pants. You ta" to her tomorrow, will you, Stell? I'll call her tonight right after dinner. That's the best time to catch her. Good, be sure and do that, eh. Mmm-hmm. You've got it all figured out. It never struck you that Rudolf might have his own ideas of what he wants in a wife? You're right, Katie. You're absolutely right. We've got to get the guy somethin' good. We can't take a chance on a false number. Uh-huh. Oh, what's the use? I know who we'll get for Rudolf. Who, ma? Anna. Who did you say, Theresa? I said, Anna. Have you gone out of your mind? No, Joe. It come to me like a big light. Here's our chance to give Anna a fresh start. I made a rule, we don't ta" about her in this house no more. And I keep that rule, Joe. We don't ta" no bad about Anna. This is good for her. This is good we can do Anna. She ain't no good, but she'd do for him. You're speaking of your own sister. So what? She's nothing but a slut. Don't you say that, Stella. There's no one got a right to call her that. Pa didn't kick her out for nothing. You shut your mouth, or I'll slap you down! You just try. Nobody's gonna slap my wife down but me. You and who else? Right. Let's settle this thing. Let's all keep our heads. Now here's our chance to look at this thing from the human angle. What? Well, we've all got different angles. Let's just put them all together and do as I say. Now anybody can see that ma is right. She's absolutely right. Anna's the girl we ought to get for Rudolf, so we'll just get her. Never! Never in this world! Maybe she's changed. She don't look a day older. How do you know? Stanley? A friend of mine saw her. I. .. I didn't want to tell you, ma. Tell me what? Nothin' ma. Anyway, she's... she's lookin' just great. What if she won't have Rudolf? Stop that ta... Didn't you just hear Katie read the letter? Didn't you hear Otis tell me to find his son a god-fearing woman? Joe, you've got to give Anna this chance. No! No, Theresa! Have you gone crazy? But, Joe, she... I swore it then, and I swear it now: She don't come back in this house! She don't come back in this house! Well, I guess he means she don't come back in this house. No. No. Joe wants her back. It's just that stubborn, bullheaded pride of his that hates to admit he's done wrong. You don't know what you're doin', ma. They only want her back to sell her like an animal. I don't know what you're ta"in' about, child. All I know is I want Anna back, that's all. I'll make Joe go fetch her. I'll break him down, you'll see. Do you think she can make that old ox see the light? If she don't, I guess I'll just have to have a little talk with him. If I don't get that new wardrobe, I won't be able to step out of this house. I never dreamt people could be so inhuman. At least we're not hypocrites. Well, who's a hypocrite? You. You're not so keen on living under the same roof with that streetwalker. That never entered my head. I'd like to meet Anna. I've a feeling she's got a lot of her mother in her. And I never met anyone sweeter and nicer than Theresa. Let go of me, Theresa. I won't let you go till you promise me you'll let Anna come back. Get away from me, Theresa! If we don't give her this chance, we may never get... - Oh, ma. - Are you hurt, ma? You girls take ma upstairs. Let her rest. He's got to give Anna another chance. He's got to. It's all right, ma, you leave him to me. Go up with them, Stanley. I wanna ta" to him, too. I ain't ta"in' to none of you. I'm gonna talk and you'll listen... You get out of my house! We only want to get some sense into you, pa. You two, get out! We should throw you out. Who's paid the rent for 2 years? Shut up! Don't tell me to shut up. Cut that out. Now beat it, like I told you. Go on! Gee, I hate to see that, Joe. That's bad, your own son raisin' his hand to you. That's bad upbringin'. You ain't done so good by Stella, either. I had a hard job housebreaking that woman. Seems like the only one you showed any loving care for was Anna. You was real fond of her, wasn't you? I was. Yeah, she turned out to be your prize mistake. Well, that's the pity of it all, but as the old ea yin' goes: "It's an ill wind that don't carry a silver lining." Now we can make some good out of all this bad, you and me. I know what you're drivin' at, so you can save your breath. Oh, sure. You ought to know I ain't the one for wastin' words. There's much quicker ways of gettin' things done than ta... Now why was it you kicked Anna out, Joe? Why did you do it? I did what the hymnbook told me. The hymnbook? Now you ain't a religious man, Joe. Can't even get you to go to church on Sunday. You rather lay in bed. No, it wasn't the hymnbook. Now, ma says it was your pride. Now you could have never took no pride in this family. So what was it, Joe, that made you kick her out? And why won't you have her back? 'Cause I ain't gonna let you spend Otis slocum's money. There ain't nothin' in this world I hate more than I do a liar. That ain't a lie. It's the truth. You just heard from Otis today, yet you kept Anna out of this house for all this time. I'm gonna give you one last chance to say the truth, Joe. So come on, out with it. It'll save you a whole lot of sweat. I don't know what you're talkin' about. There ain't no truth but what I've already said. Oh, yes, there is. You're afraid. You're afraid to admit you done wrong. That's what's eatin' your guts. I did right, I tell you! I did right. What are you hollerin' about, Joe? What's the matter with you? Nothing. Nothing. Nothing? Look at you, trembling like an old fool. What are you trembling about? Because all the things you say are lies. All lies. Then prove it! Prove it by bringin' her back and showin' all of us you can act like a father to her. A nice, kind father, Joe. No. No. Yellow, huh? Then I guess I'll just have to give you a little courage. This is where you need it, Joe, right here. Let's get downtown and get you on that bus for San Diego. I can't do it. I can't do it, I tell you. But you gotta, Joe. M-Maybe tomorrow. No, tonight. Stanley, what was the name of that place your friend saw Anna? Noah's Wharf Cafe. Is he gonna go? Your son asked you a question, Joe. I ain't got the fare. Here, give me some fare, Stanley. Easy. That money's Katie's as well as mine. Am I gonna have trouble with you, too? Come on, Joe. Frank, is he going? Yeah, ma. He had a change of heart. Is he really going? That's my good Joe. Come on, you're holdin' up the parade. Yeah, when you gotta go, you can't stay. I knew you'd do it, Joe. God bless you. We're gonna have our little Anna back again. Come on. Lester, boy, your fate is in my hands. Hey, Noah! I'm closed. Come on, man. Open up for a hot sailor on a cold night. Hey, Noah, it's Danny Johnson. Let him in. Now I'll never get to bed. Hi, Noah. Hey, wait a minute don't shut that door. There's a lonesome gob out there. Lester, what are you gonna do? Stand in the breeze all night? Come on in. Hello, baby. Hiya, Danny. Is it good to see you! Hey, don't handle me like a sack of potatoes. Hey, you lost weight, baby. Yeah, among other things. But you're still a fine-looking chick. Thanks. Hey, Lester, look what I found. Well, you sure don't lose no time. No, this is the girl I've been tellin' you about. Oh, pardon me. And pardon me. Is this the last of the convoy? Yeah, Noah, it's the last of the convoy. This is Lester. He's the cat with all the loot. He's treasurer. Lester, I want you to know Anna Lucasta. Once you've met Anna, you've come up against the main event. How are you? How do you do? It looks as though you've met someone in Lester. Now you know that I only know the best kind of people. Come here and tell me something. Why didn't you write me? We docked in long beach and took a cab all the way here to find you, didn't we? That's right, but it sure was worth the cab fare. Hey, your friend's got the makings. Yeah, I towed him along to bring out my finer qualities. He says I'm a gentleman in the rough. I sure am rough, ain't I, baby, and don't you love it? May... maybe I'd better go and write myself a letter. No, man, stay and enjoy yourself. Enjoy myself? Well, uh, maybe I could order some drinks? Hey, now, that's a good idea. Why couldn't you have thought of that? 'Cause my mind's racing way ahead of that, baby. Yeah, but we've got company, remember? Did you say something about a drink, sailor? Pardon me for buttin' in. Don't apologize. You're too good-looking for that. Now come on. Don't get him all steamed up, baby. This is his first cruise. But not my first port. Now come on, folks, what'll it be? And let's make it snappy. Just bring out a big, fat bottle. Beer for me. What did that cab set us back? What's the difference? It was worth our while, wasn't it? It must have cost us $20 getting here. And I kept ea yin' to myself on the ride, "maybe she hooked some bigshot. Maybe she left town or somethin'." Quit your jazzin'. I ain't jazzin'. Ask Lester. But no more problems now, baby. I found you, and you ain't never gonna slip away from me again. You can bet your boots on that. Now truthfully, what does that do to you? Does that bring out my finer qualities, Lester? Well, it sort of... What does he know? He likes everything plain. He's got no taste. Wait a minute, there's something else that goes with it. Ah, here we are. Dig. Hey. Danny, this looks like it's been worn before. Now let me see if I can find the rest. Hey, wait a minute. Hey, where's papa? Lester, where's papa? If you left papa on the ship... here he is. Where do I wear that? You don't wear him, honey. He's someone you're gonna get to know real well. Another one of your West Indian puzzles. How do I take him apart? You don't take him apart. You treat him with respect, and he'll do you favors. Like right now, he's planning something really big for you. Do you know what he's talking about, Lester? Oh, it's a mighty big plan. Tell her who papa is. Uh, that's a model of Agoue, the Haitian god of the sea. Seems he's good to sailors. Looks like papa and me has got something in common. Oh, come on, be serious, will you? You see, my cruise is up in a few days. And I ain't about to sign up for another 4-year hitch. What did they do? Give you the rush? Give me the rush? Did you hear that? Ain't it ridiculous, papa? The admiral himself begged me not to leave, didn't he, Lester? He cried like a baby. What do you do now? Now I get me a hack, and I go back to hackin'. And pretty papa here is gonna ride the radiator cap. There's the little matter of a previous drink for the lady. Lester, pay the man, will you? Here you are, honey. Here's looking at it. Happy times. Where did you say you are you from, Lester? Hartford, Connecticut. Oh, a real blue blood. You know, this cat can even speak French. No kidding? Yeah. Say something in French, Lester. Oh, I only know a few words. I bet they're the right ones. Yeah, but like I was saying... Yes, what were you saying, Danny? About the big plan. You're gonna go back to hackin'. That's only half of it, honey. You know how it is in the Navy, honey. You get pushed around from pillar to post. I figure now that I'm out, what I need is an anchor. Around your neck. Ha-ha-ha, funny. Funny, funny. I know what you think, you think like everybody else, you think that all I do is hang in joints like this with broads, and boozin', and lovin', don't you? Mmm-hmm. That's only part of it. There's another side, too: The side that wants a home with someone in it. Someone you come home to after a hard day's hackin' and say... "hack me a hunk of steak." What do you mean? She means you're lookin' for a cook. What're you tr yin' to do? Louse this thing up? What "thing"? What are you leading up to? Look, I'll give it to you straight, baby. A home without a woman in it is just a pile of cold bricks. Now what do you say me and you get together, huh? Are you asking me to marry you, Danny? Well, something like that. What's something like marriage? It's practically the same thing. What's the same thing? Look, honey, havin' a preacher say a few words over you, and giving him $2, anybody can do this. Let's me and you be different, huh? How different? Well, look, honey, take on the islands, for instance. Lester will bear this out. When a cat meets a chick and they dig each other, they put a coconut in middle of the ground, a guy comes along with a knife and goes, Chuck. And like that, they're married. Did you bring any coconuts in that bag, Danny? Why don't you marry her, Danny? Lester, the talking lamp is out. Take it easy, Danny. I was only putting you on. You said it so funny, you gave me goose pimples. You shouldn't scare me like that. What's wrong with you? Have you gone nuts? Sure I'm nuts. So are you nuts. The whole world's nuts. Come on, Lester, let's dance. Oh, I can't dance. What's the matter? You got goose pimples, too? No, I just can't dance. Oh, sure you can dance. I sure wish I could. I know you can dance if you want to. ♪ Lester. ♪ Break it up. Break it up. Break it up! No dancing allowed. Besides, there are those who would like to go to bed. Hey, you know, that ain't a bad idea, baby. Hey, what do you say, papa? Hey, what do you say about that, huh? But we haven't finished dancing yet. Don't close up. Come on, Lester, buy us another round. Yeah, and smile, Lester. Don't you want to be happy? Lester doesn't know whether he wants to be happy or good. But we do, don't we, baby? We sure do. Well, here's looking at you. Yeah, happy times. Noah. Well, what's with you? What can I do for you? Anna, I came up to see you and to ta" to you. You handed me enough to last me a lifetime. You're on my territory now. I don't have to take anything from you here, so beat it! Hey, who is this old guy? Boys, you've got strong nerves. Meet my old man. What's on your mind, pop? I'd like to ta" to my daughter alone. Let's go, Danny. No, don't go. Stick around. Well, you can't refuse to talk to your father. Who says I can't? It's a free country, ain't it? He told me what he thought of me when he kicked me out. I'm here to ask you to forget all that and to come home with me. Why the change of heart, pa? You think I'm loaded with loot or something? Don't talk that way to your father. Who says she can't? What are you butting in for? We still have free speech. It isn't only me that wants you home. It's the whole family. There ain't nothing wrong with ma, is there? Anything wrong? No. No, she's well. It's just that she wants to see you real bad. Won't you come home with me? I can't. Why? Why the hell do you think? Why are you buggin' her, old man? Can't you see you're getting her all upset? Now, you just keep out of this, sailor. This is none of your business. Who says so? I know what she's thinkin'. And so would you, if you'd use a little sense. She don't belong at home no more. You should've thought of that before you kicked her out. What right have you to say that, Danny? She belongs at home if they want her. Have you anything better to offer? Will you quit buttin' in? At least Lester ain't depending on papa Agoue. If you want the advice of your number one gin peddler, Anna, you'll go. At least it'll give you time to think. Who wants to spend a lifetime thinkin'? You might try it for 5 minutes! Anna, I have a bus ticket for you here in my pocket. Won't you come home with me? Stanley married one of them foster girls, didn't he? Katie, she's a nice girl. You'll like her, Anna. I guess mama still makes spoon bread and peach cobbler. And she sure keeps the linen nice and fresh. Won't you come home with me? Well, what have I got to lose? Nothing but your mind from boredom. At least it's 3 squares and a place to flop. You can have them with me, baby. I was many months without them, Danny, while you were riding the billows. Can we go up and get your things now, Anna? Take it easy, pa. I've got them all on. I'll think about you, Noah, whenever I get thirsty. Yeah, you do that, and you send me a postcard, you know, like '"x' marks my window." Will you frame it, Danny? I'll tear it up. Good hackin', kid. And take care of Lester, will you? Let him bring out your finer qualities. Well, I hope you're satisfied, bigmouth. You loused up my whole evening. She wasn't thinking about an evening. She was offering you a whole lifetime. Oh, Lester, boy, how did you ever get in the Navy? Well, I see you bought the car. Not exactly, Frank. I got it on a 7-day trial. Well, not too big, not too small. I approve. How do you like it? You still sell the same junk. Hey, Frank, come on. We'll be late. Oh! Stanley, it's beautiful. Can we use it to pick up Rudolf? It ain't exactly mine just yet. Get in. It will be by the time we get Rudolf back to this house. ♪ Oh, you better mind ♪ ♪ you better mind ♪ ♪ you've got to give an account at the judgment ♪ ♪ you better mind ♪ ♪ you better mind how you ta" ♪ ♪ you better mind ♪ Ma, do you think that sign of Frank's is gonna inspire Rudolf's confidence in this family? I think it's a very pretty sign, excepting I believe he would've inspired more confidence had he painted George Washington's picture up there. ♪ You feel pretty good today, aren't you, ma? Oh, with Anna back again, I got a feelin' everything's gonna be good for everybody. Ma, I think I'll quit my job and go into business with Frank. Whatever makes you happy, son. Then I guess I better look for a steady job tomorrow. I thought you two was the happiest couple in the neighborhood. She's always pickin' on me. I can't do anything right. Oh, it's not him alone, ma. He's following Frank and Stella's lead, as usual. What about? You know what they're planning to do as soon as they get Rudolf into this house. Well, we all hoping the same thing, Katie: That Rudolf will like Anna and she'll like him. You're for Anna, ain't you, Katie? You act as though you like her. Of course I do. She's an intelligent and attractive girl and very considerate. But I'm not going to be mixed up in any scheme to use her for other people's gain. You talking to me, Katie? No, she's slammin' me, because I think like Frank and Stella, that if we make Anna respectable by marrying her to this country hick, we certainly rate a few of the potatoes he's carrying. Well, Katie, if they get married, I'm sure they'd both want to help out. You ain't suggested that to her, have you, ma? Of course not. I'm waitin' to see if Rudolf's good enough for Anna. You just live in the clouds, don't you, ma? I feel like I was in heaven ever since Anna come home. So good just to hear her voice, even though she does say frisky things. She made me laugh fit to bust the other night in bed, telling me all about them funny people she waited on in that restaurant in San Diego. So that's what she was slingin', eh, hash? Yeah, Stanley, that's how she lived. I always knew Anna was good at heart, and wouldn't end in the gutter because she made one slip. Do you think she only slipped once, ma? I know Anna's good. Ain't nobody can tell me different. I know that the first night she come home, cradled up in my arms, and cried herself to sleep. I knew her heart was just as good and sweet as it was when she was a little baby in that same bed at my breast. One time, she woke up, and she just said: "Is it rainin'?" And I said, "yes, honey, it's rainin'." She said, "that's nice." Went off to sleep again, just like a little baby. Joe, why ain't you down at the station to help bring Rudolf? I ain't got the heart to meet him, Theresa. Glued to a stool at Mike's saloon. Yeah, that's right. Now you keep sober and tidy up a bit to meet your best friend's boy. Let me alone. Come on, ma. Let's get the dinner. What's the matter, pa? You're nervous as an old dog with ticks. The lord strikes down them who mock their parents. Don't bring me that hymnbook hi-de-ho. I'm too fast for that mess. Ah. What's the matter, pa? Stanley riding you about your hymnbook? Where did you get that? Ma gave it to me. I thought I'd read for myself your gospel about dying and going to hell. There's a whole lot in here about heaven, too, and how to get there. I missed them. "Beulah land." My pappy and my grandpappy used to sing. And sing. And sing. ♪ Beulah land ♪ ♪ walk in Beulah land ♪ They used to sing and sing until they didn't have a bit of breath left. And no more gin. Don't you call my pappy a drunkard. You, you heathen! What's the matter, Stanley? Why do you always have to bring people down? We just got pa to singing. Come on, pa. Give out some more of that dwelling in Beulah land. I forgot the tune. But you were just singing it. I forgot it, I told you. Come on, Stanley, let's dance. Not with my feet. How about you and me, pa? No. No. ♪ You taught me how. Remember? Let's dance, pa. No, don't put your hands on me. How dare you! Have you gone crazy? Pa! ♪ Beulah land ♪ ♪ Beulah land ♪ Anna, would you like a cup of coffee or something? No, I-I'll wait for dinner. You're putting on a mighty big spread for that gentleman caller. Well, it's the least we could do for the son of an old friend of pa's. And Frank and Stella drive all the way down to union station to pick him up? Simple courtesy. That's a new word for it. You shut up. You're not going to shut me up. Take it easy, Katie. I know what Rudolf's coming for. Ma told me. They're not interested in making you respectable. They're just out to get Rudolf's money. Are you out of your mind? Oh. So the guy's got dough? How much? His father gave him... $45. $4,000. Well, you can't do it, Anna. You can't. Why not? Don't you want to see me respectable, like Stanley says? You'd only be cheapening yourself. Well, I'm not too expensive anyway, Katie. Where's Rudolf? Yeah, where's Rudolf? Did he come in? He came in. What did you do with him? Oh, I took him out and bought him a couple of beers. He got real drowsy. Then I took him down to the hotel and watched him unpack. He's all set now for a long night's sleep. Tomorrow morning, I'll go buy him breakfast and take him to church. Ain't he coming up to dinner? No, he's not coming for dinner. Say, what's the mystery? You two been cooking up something. We've got to get a whole new approach to this thing, Stanley. This Rudolf ain't all we bargained for. What's the matter with him? Plenty. Our Rudolf graduated from agricultural college. Graduated from college? With honors. With honors? Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. Yeah, that boy's daddy sure done us a dirty trick. We're still gonna marry him off to Anna, aren't we? Not a chance. He's too clean-cut. He'd see through her in a minute. Then how are we gonna get the dough? That's the problem. Are you sure he's got it? Oh, hell, yeah. He's got a wallet in his breast pocket there that makes him walk lopsided. If only we hadn't listened to ma about getting Anna. We should have got Tom's daughter, like I said. Listen, brainstorm, frank mentioned to Rudolf that Otis said he was anxious to get married. What do you think he said? What? "Oh, that was pa's idea. I came to California to get a job." Well, we got to keep Rudolf away from Anna. Can't have her disgracing us. Mmm-mmm. I'm afraid that won't be so easy. Why? Because now she's hot after Rudolf's dough. Who told her about the dough? You big blabbermouth! It was Katie, she gave the whole thing away. Look, can't I leave you two alone for a minute? The moment my back's turned, some one of you gums up the works. Oh, ma, they're back. Got to get a brand-new approach. Yes, sir, I know just what it's gonna be. I'm gonna take the investment approach. Get him to invest his money in something special. I've got to approach him through his interest. What is Rudolf's interest? Agriculture. Mmm? Frank? Yeah. Where's Rudolf? Oh, uh, he was all played out, ma. That's a tough trip from Alabama. When are we gonna eat? He was too tired to come up to meet us all? To meet Joe, his father's oldest friend? Well, uh, I explained to him that Joe ain't been so strong lately, and he agreed that tomorrow would be soon enough. When are we gonna eat? I never was so disappointed. Got a real southern dinner for the boy. I think he's acting careless. I don't think he's showing the proper respect. Well, you're right there, ma. He ain't showing respect. But then... Well, you know these southern hayseeds. Did you tell him we were expectin' him? I sure did. But what can you do when a guy is all tired out and don't want nothing but bed? He was sure worn out, wasn't he, Stell? Could scarcely walk. Someone's at the front door. See who it is, Stanley. Oh, Frank, I think it's Rudolf. Well, let the boy in, Stanley. Won't you come in? We's all mighty glad to see you, Rudolf. Oh, thank you, ma'am. I would have knowed you anywhere. Why, he's the spittin' image of his pappy when he was his age, so neat and good-looking. Now, Mrs. Lucasta, you're gonna get me all fussed. Oh, you mustn't feel like that. Got to make yourself at home, and let me treat you like I would my own son Stanley. It ain't right what Frank said, that you're too tired to eat, is it? Too tired? Uh-huh. Oh, no, ma'am, I'm never too tired to eat. That's the way I like to hear my sons talk. I'm Katie. Oh, hi, Katie. How are you? Excuse me. I have to get back to the kitchen. Come on in and sit down, Rudolf. Make yourself at home. Come on. Thanks, Frank. Uh, where's Anna? Keep her up there. Well, Rudolf. Oh, I hope I'm not interrupting dinner, Frank? But I just didn't feel right not coming over to pay my respects. Oh, think nothing of it. Have a shot? I mean, a drink? No, thanks. I still feel those 2 beers I had with you. Well, it takes a wise man to know his own limitations. That's a good paraphrase of Socrates, Frank. Socrates? Oh, yeah, Socrates. Sure. I had to read him in college. Uh, say, have a cigar, eh? Uh, no, thanks. No? But if you don't mind... Oh, go right ahead. Help yourself. Thank you. Say, Rudolf, uh, what did they teach you in that agricultural college? Most anything I wanted to learn. Things like plowing and hoeing, I suppose, huh? Plowing and hoeing? I knew all about that when I was 10. You did, eh? Well, of course, I suppose there's always, uh, new inventions, oh, like mechanical plows and mechanical hoes, uh, electric... Well, ever heard of a tractor, Frank? A trac... oh, tractors, sure. Oh, my, yes. A tractor. Yeah, you know, I was talking with a guy the other day. Smart fellow he was, too. And, uh, he had a brand-new approach to these, uh, tractors. What was his name? His name? Oh... oh, well, you see, uh, he was just an inventor. You understand. They like to keep these things secret, you see? Nobody's gonna steal his name. Uh, no, I... I suppose not. Well, uh, let's see. What was his name? He, uh, not Mccormick? No, no, no. Uh, it wasn't Deere, was it? Deere? How do you spell that? D-e-e-r-e. That sounds like it. Yeah, that's what it was, Mr. Deere. I remember now. He ought to know. Along with Mccormick, he's the biggest manufacturer of tractors in the world. He... uh, oh, well, no, that wasn't the man. Uh, you... you see, this was just an inventor. You understand? A private inventor. Oh. Well, pa taught me one thing real early. Keep away from new inventions until they're foolproof. Pa made his money with the old-fashioned plow and hoe. Yeah. Boy, your old man is a character. Mmm, yeah. Well, uh, Rudolf, what is your, uh, special agricultural interest, son? Well, Frank, I'm interested in everything that goes into and comes out of the earth. Uh-huh. But in college, I... I did some special kind of work with fertilizers. Yea... Fertilizers? That's just plain ordinary... That ain't nothing but manure. You ought to know someone in that, Frank. Pretzels, Rudolf? Thank you, Stella. Isn't anybody going to introduce us? Oh, uh, that... That's. .. that's Anna. How do you do, Anna? Y-You a neighbor? A neighbor? Oh, did I forget to mention I had a sister? I've been away for such a long time, they've hardly got accustomed to me. Shouldn't take long to get accustomed to you. It don't, as a rule. Say, Rudolf, uh, how would you like me to take you around and explain to you about all these antiques I got here? Oh, I-I'd like to, Frank. Good, come along. Later? Oh. Well. Where have you been living? There's something about the sea that I've always liked. Have you ever been to San Diego? No, that's the large naval base, isn't it? Mmm-hmm. Lifeblood of the whole town, the Navy and the merchant marine. What... what did you do in San Diego? Uh... Well, wasn't that ma I heard calling us to dinner? I didn't hear anybody. Uh, well, I'll go hurry her up. What did you say you did in San Diego? Well, I didn't go to college. Stanley says you graduated. Yeah, just last month. That's a good-looking ring you're wearing. Keepsake from some college girl, I'll bet. Oh, no, no, no, that's my fraternity ring. Yes, that is an expensive hunk of jewelry you've got there. Got to be careful with your valuables in this town. I wouldn't carry too much cash around with me. Yeah. We've got some bad people in California. Say, how'd you like to get a couple of beers before dinner, Rudolf? Come on, let's go have one, huh? Oh, no, thanks. I feel fine. You do? What the hell... Just fine. Uh, except that it... it is a little warm in here, isn't it? Why don't you take your coat off? I-I-If you don't mind. Be real casual. Thank you. What you totin'? A gun? No, that's my wallet. Say, Rudolf, I recently came into possession of a burglar-proof safe. I can take this and... Put it in the bank. Yeah, I plan to deposit it tomorrow. I'll take you down to my bank, introduce you to the manager. Oh, that's Joe. I guess you remember, I told you, he wasn't very strong these days. Hello, Mr. Lucasta. I'm awful glad to meet you. I've heard about you all my life. Otis. No, I'm Otis' son, Rudolf. Rudolf? Rudolf. Well, how's my old friend, Otis? Oh, pa's just fine, Mr. Lucasta. He... he sends you his very best wishes. Otis told me to get you a good wife. So Frank said. That's like pa. He... he still think I'm in short pants. You wanna watch out for the women, son. Oh, sure. And the wine. If one don't get you, the other one will. Watch out for your money. Don't let nobody get hold of it. No, sir. You better put it... You better... You better put it down, Joe. Come on now, sit down. Let me go! Can't you see I'm talking to my old friend Otis? Well, it's too bad he can't hear you. He's a thousand miles away. That's Otis. That's Rudolf. You let me alone. I'm telling you, I'll fight you! Just take it easy, Joe. Let me go! Leave him alone, Frank. Pa, would you like to have a cup of coffee? You. Don't you talk to me. You get away from me, or I'll slap you... - Stanley! - Yeah? Come here. Let's go. You'll have to excuse Joe, Rudolf. He has a psychological problem. Yeah. He just can't seem to find the bottom of the bottle. I never considered myself much of a dancer till tonight. It must be you. Was that the mambo we were doing? Ha. How do you like that! I can do the mambo and never had a lesson. Where'd you like to go now? I'd like to go home. I ... I haven't had as much fun in my whole life, as I've had this past week with you. The night's gone so fast, I... I didn't realize it's past... past 1 :00 already. Is it really? You sound tired. Are you? A little. Oh, I'm sorry, honey. I... I kept you out late every single night, haven't I? To you, I guess all these places are familiar. But me, I've been having a ball. It's good to be with you, Anna. Gosh, I never thought I'd be lucky enough to run into anybody like you. I'm glad you enjoyed your vacation. Vacation? I've come to California to stay. I've got my eyes on a job already. Where? Valley junior college. I sent my credentials. I-I'm just waiting to hear now. But I thought you wanted to farm. Modern farming. Oh! You know, it's a mystery to me how you ever got yourself into that dress. It looks like you were poured into it. Now, what do you mean by that? Have I said anything wrong? Well, it isn't necessary to tell a girl how she fills out a dress. Well, I haven't said anything I wouldn't to my own sisters, and they never took offense. Well, I guess it's probably just my dirty mind. Don't say that about yourself. You're just a little prudish, and I like it. Have it your way, brother. Then we can be friends? That shouldn't be difficult. Gee, your hands are soft. Soft and cool, like... like... like topsoil. Rudolf, what are you? Just a college cutup? Well, if that's the way I strike you, sure, I'm just a college cutup. Well, you can't be serious, telling me that my hands are like topsoil. You make it sound silly, and makes me out a plain ass. Well, I didn't mean it that way. It's... Well, you're such a funny kid. I never met anybody like you before. Well, I never met anyone like you. I sure never did. You seem to be looking right through people, and reading their thoughts. According to you, I don't always read them right. Oh, I think that's because you don't trust people. Someone must have hurt you. More than one, brother. Why... why should anyone want to hurt you? Let's go. Here. It's getting a little cool. Thanks. I been talking with your mother. She seems worried about you. Why? She's afraid you might leave home again. I didn't intend to stay this long. Then you haven't found me altogether unattractive? I like you. That's a beginning. That's where it ends. All week long, I thought we were getting to know each other a little better every day. Even if we didn't talk, I felt it, that we were beginning to mean something to each other. Then, back on the dance floor, while I was holding you close in my arms, I knew I suddenly lost you. What is it, Anna? Please tell me. When I was little, pa was real good to me. He changed when the boys started walking me home from school. One of them, Charley, was a good dancer, so pa hated him. So he made us break up the night of the school prom. I left the house after dinner and came over here to this park. I had a feeling Charley would come here, too, and he did. We sat on this bench holding hands. There wasn't much we could say to each other. And then pa came tearing into the park like a maniac, calling me every name under the sun. He took hold of Charley and hit him hard. Then he took hold of me. I... I've never seen a look like that on a man's face before. He... he dragged me back to the house, forced me to pack my bag, took me down to the bus station, gave me $20, and told me never to come home again. I don't remember buying a ticket to anyplace. I was crying so hard. I just remember getting off in San Diego, not knowing how to go about finding myself a place to stay. Well, the fleet was in and a friendly sailor picked me up. He took me to dinner, stole my $20, and that's the last act of human kindness I experienced. I'm not cold anymore. The wind must have changed. Don't go in yet. You'll miss your bus. I can't leave you like this. I'm sorry I spoiled the evening for you. You didn't. I'm glad you told me the things you did. It made you seem closer to me. That's not why I told you. I know. You want to be honest with me. Well, I'll be honest with you, Anna. I love you. I want you to be my wife. Look, you don't like this town, we don't have to live here. Well, we can go back home. I can teach there. We can go anywhere, as long as you're with me. Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Don't say nothing, honey. Just let me hug you. And god bless you for loving my Anna. Don't be a fool, ma. Don't make something out of nothing. You can't tell me, honey, you don't love him. I saw the way you was kissing him. I learned how to kiss a long time ago. But don't you love me, Anna? Even a little bit? Sure I love you, more than a little. But not enough to marry you. Honey, you told me the other night in bed, you'd get married if the right man came along. People say funny things in bed, ma. But I know you meant that, Anna. You wasn't being funny. Whoever heard of such a crazy thing? A guy walks into your house and says hello, and the next thing you know, you're marrying him off to your daughter. Nobody's marrying me off to anybody I don't want. And it don't take 10 days to fall in love, it takes only 10 seconds. I knew that the minute I saw your face. But everybody isn't like you, Rudolf, with nothing but goodness in them to show in their faces. I know you're good, Anna. She is good. Can't you see what's happening, Anna? God has sent this lovely boy into our home just for you. He's sent him in answer to prayers, 'cause you never had a fair chance. And the boy's fell in love with you from the start. That's god's doing, too. God's giving you your chance for love and happiness. You ain't gonna break his heart and Rudolf's, too, are you? God can stand anything, ma, but Rudolf ain't so husky. Oh, come on. Stop fightin' me, will you, Anna? Are you deaf, dumb, and blind? Didn't you hear anything I told you in the park? I heard what you said. Every word. And it makes no difference. What are you gonna do with a guy like this? Love him, child, and make him happy. Well, your ma's got the right idea. Now come on, knock that chip off your shoulder. Say you'll marry me. At your own risk, Rudolf. I'll take it. What the hell's goin' on here? They're going to be married. Who? Anna and Rudolf? Who do you think? Well, what do you know! Congratulations, Anna. Congratulations. Thank you, Stella. Ma, it looks like we're gonna lose our little Anna again. You may kiss your brother-in-law, Stell. All right, all right. What do you want to do? Give the impression our women are loose? Where you kids gonna spend your honeymoon? Where Anna wants to. I know a nice little place in San Francisco. How would you know? You've never been to San Francisco. A fellow told me about it. Come on, let's everyone come inside and have a drink to celebrate. I don't know if I've ever been so happy. ♪ Wade in the water ♪ ♪ Wade in the water, children ♪ ♪ Wade in the water ♪ ♪ god's gonna trouble the water ♪ Frank, run upstairs and tell Katie to give you the bride and groom. The bride and groom? Yes, she'll find them underneath my bed. Hey, ma, lay off the liquor until after the weddin'. Anna's upstairs dressin', Rudolf's down at the hotel waiting. They're not underneath any bed. I'm talking about the little bride and groom that goes on top of the cake. Why didn't you say so? Hey, Katie. - Katie? - Yes? Get the bride and groom from under ma's bed. They're in a cardboard box. In a cardboard box. All right. Never can understand a woman's brain. If they don't want to understand somethin', nothin' on god's green earth will make them. Just tell them there's a bride and groom in a box under a bed, they know exactly what you mean. That's easy, Frank. Women just play dumb, men are born that way. Oh, how do you feel, Joe? I thought you was too sick to get out of bed, Joe. I feel a little better. Joe, you've come to yourself. Maybe you'll change your mind and take Anna up the aisle. No, Theresa, I ain't never gonna feel that good. You go on back to bed and stay there. I come and go as I please. Right now, I'm pleased to look at your weddin' preparations. All set for an orgy, ain't you? If you've got it in your head you're comin' down to church and raise a lot of ruckus, you better get it out. 'Cause one peep out of you, and I'll take you out and dunk your head in the sink. Don't talk crazy. Why would Joe want to break up the weddin'? You wouldn't understand, ma. You're too young and cute. Frank, answer the door. I gotta get these funny-looking things out of my hair. Oh, hey, ma. Uh-huh. Put this away in a safe place, will you? Rudolf, what are you doin' here? Waitin' around in that hotel room just made me nervous. Is everything going all right? Oh, sure. How's Anna? Just dancing with joy. Is she nervous? Well, nice and nervous, you know. Well, where's Stanley? No, he wouldn't be in there. I sent him out to get the car washed. He should've been back an hour ago. What if he doesn't show up on time? Well, then I'll act in the double capacity as your best man. Be sure that everything comes out all right. You got nothin' to worry about. Hello, Mr. Lucasta. I hope you're feelin' better today. I've been feelin' dizzy all the morning, son. Oh, I'm... I'm sorry to hear that. I got a wire from my father this mornin'. He sends his best wishes to everybody, and his special regards to you, Mr. Lucasta. Yeah, I can see your pa driving your ma to their wedding in that old high cart, as though it was yesterday. Well, I hope Stanley didn't have a flat tire. Oh, no, the car's carryin' a spare. Matter of fact, that's the only good tire on the car. Maybe I better give you the ring and papers, just in case. Oh, yes, yes, yes. Uh-huh. Rather small... I mean, uh, little. Uh, that is, rather neat. It's not too expensive, but excellent taste. License, huh? Yeah, let's see, uh-huh. What is that? Oh. Say, you know, these health certificates, uh, that's somethin' new since I was married. Yeah. All nice and healthy. You're a healthy boy, all right. You know, I was talkin' with a guy the other day. Smart fellow he was, too. This is what he said. He said, "the trouble with most modern marriages is that they're all contracted in ignorance." And he was right, too. He was 100 percent right. Yes, it's wonderful how many ignorant people get married. Ain't it the truth! Katie, how's Anna, Katie? Just fine. Can I see her for a second? No, it's bad luck. But I've got some important news to tell her. I'll tell her. What is it? Valley junior college has confirmed my appointment. I just got a letter from the... the head of the school. They want me to start teaching in the fall term. That's wonderful, Rudolf. I hear that's a very fine school. A real live professor in the Lucasta family. Well, who'd have thought it? Anna will be so thrilled when I tell her. Let me tell her. Right now, you've got to get out of here. Your bride will be down, and you mustn't see her before church. Goodbye now, Rudolf. Oh, goodbye, Katie. Isn't Stanley back with the car yet? Oh, I sent him down to get it washed. He's probably taking a joyride. Guess I have to knock some responsibility into that boy's head. I tell you, Katie, this day is almost too much for a man to bear. Ma's cake would've burned to a crisp, if I didn't get a premonition in the middle of the night to come down and shut off the oven. Oh, sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice. That's my middle name. You're certainly in the groove today, Frank. The preacher ought to let you say a few words in church. Ain't that some bride? Now, who would think 2 women could look so different in the same dress? When I wore it, you looked different yourself. There was some sort of line to show where your chest started. There's Stanley. Hey, ma. Step on it. All right, all right. ♪ Stella, you sure do make pretty hats. But, ma, you got it on upside down. Oh, who'd know the difference? Is it all right now? You look just lovely. My little baby. This is all I've been livin' for. Mom, I love you. All right. Let's break it up and get goin'. Come on. Come on, ma. Don't cry, mama, don't cry. Well, as the man said, "4 score and quite a few years ago, our forefathers brought forth on this continent a new nation..." May I help you? I came to see the Dean. Have you an appointment, sir? No, I don't have an appointment, but I think he'll want to see me. May I ask what it's about? I have some information concerning that teacher he's going to hire here. What's his name? Rudolf Slocum. What are you laughin' about? I thought Frank would never give you the ring. He sure hated to part with it. How's that, Mrs. Slocum? Couldn't be better. We've done it. We really are traveling together. Let's get away quickly, shall we? Let's not waste a minute. I have to go to the hotel, check out, get my clothes. I'll be back in 20 minutes. But I don't want to wait for that. Can't we go now? Your folks have gone to a lot of trouble for the celebration. We should stay, wait until they get back, and cut the cake. Sure, let's all sit down and have a piece of cake. We're not gonna have our first argument just as soon as we leave the church, are we? I don't have an argument left in me. Oh, we're never going to. We're going to be happy all our lives together. I'm sorry. I guess you're right. Of course I am. I'll be back before you miss me. Rudolf! Hold me. Hold me tight enough to kill me. Hi. Anybody home? You're early. The guests haven't started to arrive yet. Mind if I wait inside? Yeah. Make yourself at home. Thanks. Hello, baby. Don't take your coat off. Why? You've got to get out of here right away. What's goin' on here? And what are you dressed up for, a fancy dress ball? I've just been married. Ah, come on, Anna. Don't shake me up. Hey, it does look like somebody's been married. It couldn't be you, could it? Why not? I just got this letter you sent me. I beat it down here, like you asked. Danny, I thought after 2 days here, I wouldn't be able to stand it. That's when I sent you that letter to come down and get me. But a lot has happened since then. Oh, go on. You ain't married. Hey, wait a minute. Hey, who was that guy that just left? My husband. Well, what do you know? What do you know? Hey, what happened? Did that funny old man of yours try to put somethin' over on you? No, it's on the level, Danny, and it's of my own doing. Who is this guy? Where'd he come from? He's the swellest guy I've ever met. When did you meet him? When I came home. What did he do? Put somethin' in your drink? I don't know, but I'm sure floatin'. Ah, come on, baby. You're talking to Danny Johnson, remember? Well, you're a swell guy, too, Danny. Thanks a lot, but you don't have to con me, Anna, ever. Come on, what's the gimmick? Is the heel loaded? I wouldn't care if he didn't have a nickel. Oh, then he is loaded. That makes all the difference in the world. What is this stuff? Look. Danny, you're a good sport, aren't you? It all depends. What's on your mind? Will you beat it? Will you get out of here before he sees you? Are you ashamed of me? No. You know better than that. I'm in love with the guy. You used to tell me that, too, baby. I didn't. I couldn't have. I ... I didn't know what it was until now. You sure made me feel like it every time we came into port. Well, I was always glad to see you, Danny. I even missed you when you were. .. when you were away. But, we were 2 kids out to get our kicks. To hell with tomorrow. That's the way to live. What's your plan? Marry a guy who kisses you goodbye at breakfast, goes off to the office while you stay at home baking pies, then he plays the fiddle to you? That's horrible! Rudolf isn't a bit like that! Rudolf? You married a guy named Rudolf? Anna, that's not a name. That's a cigar. I'm sorry you don't like his first name, because his last name is Slocum. Rudolf Slocum? He sounds like a farmer. That's what he is. Oh, no, I don't believe it. I... I just do not believe that you would marry a farm... You know what I ought to do? I ought to punch him in his mouth. In fact, that's what I'll do. I'll wait here, when he walks in the door, I'll beat his brains out. It's very simple. You're getting out of here. Right now. And leave you with this farmer? Don't be silly. He's not your kind. You'd go crazy in a week without the lights and swing. That's why I'm here. That's what I'll give you. I'm through with it. I don't want it anymore. You can't get away from it! Anybody looking for it can see it in your eyes like I did the first flash I got of you. You don't belong to one man. You'll never belong to one man. You can't! Yes, I can. I know I can. Damn you! I know what you're trying to do. You're trying to scare me! I'm trying to save you a lot of grief, baby! You and me, we're real people, Anna. We're the real stuff. Many's the time we set the earth on fire. You stick with me and we'll burn it up! Are you... are you finished? Yeah, I'm... I'm finished. Now will you leave? Yes, I'll leave. And please don't try to see me anymore. I'll remember that. I'll remember that when you come crawlin' back to me. When you do, I'll probably take you back because I'm just about as weak as you are. Oh, Anna... Goodbye, Danny. This ain't goodbye, baby. How do you do? How do you do? Nice car you have outside there. Thanks a lot. Danny just came down to offer his congratulations. Is that so? Yeah. Congratulations to you, too, pop. You ought to be a very happy man today. I've seen you some place before. Yeah, in San Diego. Yes, you were the sailor that was kissing her at the bar. Well, you know how it is, pop. What's a little kiss between friends? Nothing. Nothing at all, with folks like you. I'm sorry we don't have time for a sermon. I've got to get dressed. And Danny's anxious to be on his way. Beat it, Danny. You'd better hurry, daughter. You don't want to keep Danny waiting. Uh, he's not waiting for me. Go ahead, Danny, beat it! You better wait, Danny. She'll be needing someone. What for? To take you away. I'm driving away from here in a few minutes with... with my husband. You think so? You think he'll still want you when he knows all about you? He does know! I told him everything, pa. I mean, everything. Honest. I ... I tried to talk him out of it, but he wouldn't listen to me. I know it's hard for you to believe that, because you despise me so. But it's true. Won't you please try to let me make good now? And if I mess it up, I promise you one thing: I won't bother anybody anymore. Nobody will ever see me again. I'll know what to do and where to go. You're just what you are, and nothin' on god's green earth will ever change you. Now wait a minute, pop. Why so fast on the trigger? Besides, what's the percentage in you bustin' up your little girl's wedding? Shut up, Danny. Pa, I've got happiness in the palm of my hand. And if you mess it up, I swear I'll kill you! And I don't care what happens because there'll be nothing to live for. Baby, you don't have to. If you want his mouth hushed, I'll fix it so Rudolf won't understand a word. Rudolf don't have to hear a word from me. I don't have to tell him. What have you got on your mind? Theresa told me he was getting a job somewhere near here, teaching. He is. Is he? You got somethin' to say, old man, you say it! I don't have to say it. It's been done. What's been done? I paid his Dean a visit. We had a nice talk. He agreed he shouldn't hire a teacher whose wife might teach his students something they can't get from books. You crazy old idiot. You're not protecting him. You're destroying him! And wherever else he tries to get a job, I'll go and see that Dean, too. Weren't you satisfied with messing up my life? Must you mess up Rudolf's, too? You don't care what man's making love to you, just as long as it's a man. Go back to your 3 square meals and your flop with Danny! Let's go. I don't like the way he's acting. Get me out of here! Get the hell out of here! Go on, take her out of here! Put her in your damn car and drive her to hell! Yeah. I'll take it. Money. And burn this. ♪ You gettin' good and lost, baby? I never want to be found. Hi, Blanche. How's the world treating you? Hi, Noah. How are all the animals in this smelly old ark? Meet the world's greatest lover, Danny Johnson. Danny, meet Noah. Blanche, meet Danny. Danny, meet Anna. Don't just stand there, man. Bring out the best. Ain't nothin' too good for my old lady. What are you using for money? If I had money, I wouldn't be here. Come on, you know I'm good for it. Bust loose, will you? Yeah, bust loose with the cork and let the gin flow. What's the matter, Noah? You paralyzed? You've both had enough already. Enough? I never get enough of anything. I just got started. Great idea you had, comin' here to your friends. Your friends wouldn't even let us in. Oh, Anna, if you wish, you may stay at my place tonight. Never mind. I know that old gag: "Let's all pitch in together." I'm pitching in with Danny. Didn't I promise to love you forever and ever? Or was that some other guy? I'm thirsty. Hey, Noah, come on, a couple of beers, huh? Beers? What's the matter? You gone cheapskate or somethin'? You been flingin' the dough pretty good. Come on, spend it. Mine's double gin. You ain't gettin' even a beer, Anna. Give it to me. What are you doing? Look, I'm no mooch. When I'm broke, I quit. So does the broad with me. But I can't stop now. We've got to keep going. Honey, I'm with you all the way, but we've used up this town and that's for sure. But we've got to go, go, go, Danny. Time's a-wasting. Honey, get your hooks out of me! I'm trying to figure it out. I'm thinkin'. I smell wood burning. Well, that's funny. That's real funny. Well, come to the party, man. You're driftin'. You know, sometimes I can't ever figure out how I got mixed up with you in the first place. I never asked you for nothin'. Oh, no, not much. Just every stitch on your back, booze by the case, and spending money like I was printing it myself. It's not fashionable to go broke in this town, Danny. You're out of style. I told you, Anna, to quit pushin' me. Who's pushin'? That's what you need is a good push. You... No. That's what you'd like, isn't it? I'm not about to go to the chair for beating your brains out! That's exactly what I'd do with another night of you. Go ahead and laugh! You know what she did? She busted up my cab. Papa Agoue was riding the radiator cap and she knocked his head clean off and busted my luck with it. If she busted your luck, why do you keep tagging along with her? 6 months pay gone down the drain in one lousy week. And for what? Oh, hit the road. Who needs you? You bet I'll hit the road, baby. I must have had rocks in my head to carry you this far. And I'll take this, if you don't mind. I don't figure on keeping up the payments. It's nothing but a piece of junk, anyway. It stopped running the moment I kissed you. You kissed me, all right, baby. You're the kiss-of-death broad. That's you. Danny Johnson's got a lot of traveling to do, and a lot of livin' to do, and I'm checkin' out. And don't bother writing me any letters because from now on, I'm sticking to women who have only one thing on their minds: Me. Danny. Anna, I was just talking to eddy over at the chambers. Seems like he's given the gate to one of his girls and now she's tr yin' to make out like he was beating her up, at the very same time he was down here gettin' a hole burned in his neck by that cigarette you pushed into him. You remember that night, don't you? Heaven knows you never give me no reason to do you no favors. But when I see somebody throwing themselves away like you are, it's just my natural instinct to try and save them. And I don't care what you say, eddy's a swell guy. He needs you for a witness to prove he wasn't even in the chambers that night. So if you go to him and tell him you'll stand by him, you could have his shirt. In fact, you could move right into the job he just threw that broad out of. No, thanks, Blanche. Now you look here, Anna. You can't go around kicking every man who likes you in the pants. Pretty soon, there'll be none left. Why don't you go haunt some other bar? Oh, don't you rush me. Anna, you can't fight eddy off forever. And besides, you'd be doing me an important favor with him. Huh, Anna? Good night, Blanche. All right, I'm leavin' already. Anna, there's a nice breeze comin' right off the ocean. Oh. Oh, well. What's with you? It would look ridiculous on me, anyway. Planning on shipping out, huh? Rio. What? Rio de Janeiro. You know, Brazil. That's the spot. Brazil? I saw that on a map once. That's at the bottom of the world. No, it ain't. Same distance below the equator that we are above it, and the climate's even nicer. You been there? Oh, yeah. Lots of times. I got a cousin that runs a soft drink joint down there. Let me see. The Iberia leaves tomorrow night, the Hispanita on the 20th. Hey, I know the mate on the Hispanita. He'd let me work my passage over. Take me with you, Danny. I intend to. First I got to work your fare. I can work. I can do anything. I'll shovel coal. Honey, ships today use oil. I'll have to buy your ticket. Sell your cab. Can't. It's in hock up to the hilt. Wait a minute. The Hispanita on the 20th. If I work around the clock hackin', we could make the one on the 20th. No, let's take the one tomorrow night. The first one that's leaving. Honey, relax. We'll go. 2 weeks won't make a difference. It will to me. My cousin must be really busting them up down there. Imagine, a place with booze on every corner, and they're just getting used to soda pop. It'll be a good business to break into. On the cuff? Thanks. Maybe if we went down to the wharf, the skipper on Iberia will give us a break. Not on your life. I know him. Better chance cutting bait with a shark than get his favor. Maybe I could sweet-talk him. That's out. I don't even want you to joke about it. I wasn't joking. I said, we'll go when I can pay your fare. Let's get out of here tonight, Danny. I gotta. Now let me think. Maybe I can hit Noah on the head. He ought to be good for about $20. For $20, you'd have to kill me. That's funny. Funny. I've got money. You been holding out on me? No, it's the money Rudolf gave me to buy my trousseau. Where is it? I hid it in my room. Come on, baby, there's still gas in the cab. Let's go. What's wrong? Nothin'. It's yours, ain't it? I mean, he gave it to you? Honey, Brazil. ♪ And we'll never come back to this place again? What for? We only have bad times to remember here. I wish we were on that boat now. Soon, baby, soon. Come on. No, I better wait here. Oh, it's Sunday. They're all in church. Come on. Why, it's not here. Are you sure you put it there? I thought I put it in my doll. Aw, honey, this is no good. You can't find it rummaging around like this. Relax and take your time. Close your eyes and think. Honey, will you... honey, will you sit down and listen to me? Ah. Now, with that kind of money, baby, we can buy 2 tickets and travel cabin style. Who's that? The old man must be in his room. Let's get out of here. You better give a look. He's just sleeping off a drunk. He sounds sick to me. He ain't sick or drunk. He's dying, Anna. I couldn't even hear his heartbeat. I tell you, Anna, your old man is dying. Just a month too late. A lot of good that's gonna do me now. That's a terrible thing to say. You go over there and say something to him. You hold his hand, make it up if you have to, but do something. I'll go call the doctor. Where's the phone? In the living room. I'll go. No. You stay here. I'll go. Angel. Did you have a good day at school today? Did teacher give you some homework? I'll help you with your homework. My little smart baby. Someday you're gonna grow up and be a real fine lady. Anna, if I'm not workin' next Sunday, I'll take you to the z-z-zoo. Remember that old elephant? He... he remembers you. Remember how he took the peanuts that you gave him? That's because he likes you, and he knows that you like him, too. E-E-Elephants are smart, that way. Anna, my little... little... little baby. Oh, good Jesus, sweet, sweet Jesus, look after and watch over my little... ...baby. Pa. Pa. The doctor's on his way. He... he kept calling me "angel," like he used to when I was little. I didn't know what to say to him. All I could do was sit here and watch him die, while he prayed to Jesus to watch over me! What's got.. . What's got into that boy? Well, he can't be that hungry. Oh, yes, the preacher did make an extra-long sermon. Gotta speak to that man. He sure takes good care of the soul. But the state of stress the world's in today, a man's got to have a pretty good pair of kidneys. You know, I was reading in the medical journal the other day, the doctors say the chief trouble with modern-day civilization is the headache. And you know what a headache is? It's a message from the stomach to the brain: "Don't send down no more garbage."
