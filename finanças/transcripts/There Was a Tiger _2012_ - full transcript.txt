The armies of India and Pakistan... have fought four wars in the past sixty years... but there are two government agencies in these two countries... that are at war every day... every moment... India's RAW and Pakistan's ISI. The common man does not get any news about these agencies... because in the name of national security all information is forever guarded. But there are some stories that escape these walls and office files. This is the story that shook... ...the very foundations of this secretive world. This is the story of Tiger... Goodbye... Tiger? Hello... hello... Those people are here. I told you they would find me! They found me! You've kept me here for over a month... now get me out of here! Tell me quickly... what should I do? Tell me... okay... I'll get there... you get there too! You're panting like a dog... how much do you smoke? I can't believe you sold out to them, Rabinder... How much did the ISI pay? Tiger... how much does the government job pay us? What is the going price for buying agents these days? It's a lot, Tiger! Trust me... there is a lot of money! Should be... after all you sold information to the ISI... the guys who kill our agents almost every day. So? Even we smash those guys. How many ISI men have you killed in your career alone? This is a game, Tiger... we are the smallest pawns in it. Please understand... I'll show you... Look at this, Tiger! Just see... will RAW ever give us this? Just see this, Tiger... This is... almost two months' salary. What good is it, Tiger? One fine day we'll end up dead... in some obscure part of the world... and no one will come to claim our bodies. Come with me, Tiger... there's a lot of money to be made... there's nothing in all these issues. Sorry, Rabinder... you will have to come with me... I'm not going, Tiger! I won't go with you... I'm telling you, I won't. Alive... or dead. He's back! The hero returns... He has shown up after many days. Hey, look... He's back again... Why are you so happy? I'm not happy. I'm just telling you. Look at his face... He must have been in a brawl. He goes missing for months... how can you even think of getting him married to our dear Bablee? Why are you staring at him? I'm not staring at him. Do your exercise! But what does he do? How the hell should I know? But he's a Grade 1 officer. Hello, sonny... it's nine already... ...let me give you a lift to the office. Thank you, Mr Bagga. Come... I had a briefing with Mr Shenoy at nine. Oh... Mr Shenoy is extremely punctual. Sir... Rabinder was kept near Iraq's Northern border... I had information that the ISI might move him any time. We caught him at the right time. Good Job, Tiger. Thank you, Sir... As usual... Submit the full report to Tiwari. Yes, Sir. Tiger... - Yes, Sir? Your face is badly bruised. Why don't you go on leave and rest for a bit? Sir... I'll be fine in a couple of days... Why do I need to go on leave? You've been on assignments back to back for 12 years now. That's way too long. Don't tempt fate. Sir, one fine day I'll find myself posted to a desk job, reading files... just like you do. Alright... as soon as you look normal again you can leave for your next assignment. Where, Sir? Why don't you treat me to your famous daal... then I'll find you an enemy in a new country. Done, Sir. Sir... I often get this feeling that you hired me at RAW purely for my cooking skills. You're right... for your cooking skills... and your insanity. How do you live like this, Tiger? This decade old furniture, no pictures or books or anything? Your salary has been lying untouched in the agency's salary account for the last 8 years... why? How can I spend when I'm never here? I have been traveling all over the world for the past 12 years on government funds. Wow... how much have you saved? About 2.3 million... But your money will rot in the agency's bank... No, Sir... the day I retire from this job... I'll blow it all up. Why didn't you ever have a girlfriend? Sir, how could I have one? Firstly I'm never here... and secondly this goddamn job... What's wrong with the job? Sir... we have no answers when someone asks What do you do? I'm in the civil service... What exactly is your job? I'm in administration... What is your duty? Government duty... - But what do you do? Nothing as of now... Sir... sometimes I feel like screaming and saying... I'm a spy... a RAW Agent!! Spy... Secret Agent!! I'm James Bond!! Sir... I still have time... what about you... why didn't you ever get married? When I was young... I was a bit of a poet... and poets don't settle for arranged marriages... they look for love. Did you find love, Sir? Yes... I did... once... Wow! Who was she, Sir? Well... she was this sweet simple girl... When I met her... I wanted to live my life only for her. And then? Then... my goddamn duty got in the way And you chose your duty over love? Of course... isn't that what we're trained for? But do you ever regret it, Sir? Every day, Tiger... every single day. Hello... yes, Nambiar. Right, right... thank you. It seems we've found you your next mission. Cheers, Sir! Between India and Pakistan... only India has an anti-missile system that can stop incoming Pakistani missiles to a large extent. And one man has played a big role in developing it... Professor Anwar Jamaal Kidwai... a scientist who is well known all over the world... but he's a maverick... that's why he quit his government job and started teaching at the famous Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland. But for the last few months we suspect that Professor Kidwai has been sharing his research findings with other scientists... who could be working for the Pakistan defence establishment. So I must stop him? No, Tiger... like I said, we only suspect him. All you need to do is observe him. Tiger... Please don't kill anyone here. Right, Sir... Every mission of yours... someone gets killed. Please just observe him... okay? Okay, Sir. Professor Kidwai... what an honour to meet you. I park there every day... it's my spot. Sure, Sir. Professor Kidwai... Professor! Professor Kidwai? No time, no time. Pleasure meeting you Good afternoon, Professor Kidwai! Hello! Professor... I have to speak with you about something important. Sorry, I've got to feed the dog. After feeding doggy? I won't take too much of your time... Sorry! This professor is a nutcase. Professor... Professor... Professor... I won't take up too much time. Sorry... got to take Rocket out. Shall I wait here? Rocket! Rocket! There's one girl who has access to the professor's house... a British girl of Indian origin... Zoya. A student of Trinity Dance Academy for a year now. And a part-time caretaker of his house. Get out! You really cannot be here. Sorry. I'm sorry. Relax... I really didn't mean to. Excuse... Will you please leave! You're still here? Yes... waiting for the mad professor. Next time ring the bell... or I'll get you arrested. Sorry, Miss... Does he know you? No... I have come from India. It's difficult to say when he'll be back... This is his house, right? Yes... but he goes for long walks with Rocket. Hope he hasn't gone to London. I've just come from there... I could have met him there. I'm sorry... he's troubled me all day. Very funny. Excuse me... I don't know anyone here... is there a hotel around somewhere? They're on my way... come on. We've not been introduced as yet... I'm Zoya... Friends call me Zee. I'm Manish Chandra... My friends call me Doordarshan. What? Zee... Doordarshan? That was a terrible joke. Sorry... it was seriously rotten. Check this one. Excuse me... do you have any rooms? Yes I believe we do, Sir... Thank you. Looking very lovely today. Thank you. No rooms. Try here. Good evening. Good evening, Sir... Can I help you? My name is Manish Chandra. Nice to meet you. - Thank you. This hotel is over-booked. Okay... listen... my hostel is here... but there are a couple of hotels ahead... try them if you like. Sure... thank you. Not from there... come this way... Which way? Climb the pipe... This pipe? It's wet... slippery. Wait... I'll get something for you... Okay... Take this. How? I've got a good grip. Okay... give me 100 Euros... A hundred Euros? What exactly do you do? Do you want to sleep in that room or not? My friend stays there, but she is out of town... hundred Euros? But 100 Euros is a lot... that's more expensive than hotels. Okay... then sleep on the bench. Okay, okay... but... can you take it yourself... inside the jacket pocket. Thanks. - Welcome What do you do? Me? I'm a writer. What's your business with the Professor? I'm writing a book on the finest Indian minds... and Professor Kidwai happens to be one of them. So, you're here to interview the professor? If you interview me later, that will be a huge help. Yes... why are you standing on that pipe? Go ahead... good night. What? Can you cook? Not bad... for an Indian man. Are you married? Straightaway marriage? Won't you ask me first if I have a girlfriend? No... I think you're old enough to be married now. No... I'm not married yet. Why? I don't get to meet nice girls. What are you looking for, Mr. Writer? Nothing much... Just a sweet simple girl... Someone who'd make me want to live only for her. Wow... very romantic... but you're a bit of a bumpkin when it comes to style. Really? This is the first time someone has called me that. What? A bumpkin? No... romantic. And you've been called a bumpkin before? No... that's a first as well. Good night Mr Writer. - Good night, Zoya. The 100 Euros were for this pass... a play that I'm going to choreograph... Professor Kidwai sponsors it. Your breakfast, Sir. Excuse me... can you puncture the yellow and make it solid? Okay. - Thank you What happened? Aren't you a little fussy when it comes to food? Maybe a little. So you want to spend some time with Professor Kidwai? Yes... so that I get to know him better. I'll try to speak to him... come to his house tomorrow morning. But I can't promise anything. No problem. Just the way you like it, Sir. Thank you. And here's the cheque. Whenever you are ready. I hope you don't mind if I leave you alone with your punctured eggs. I'm getting late for my play rehearsal. See you later. You pay the bill... why should I? Yes, of course... you keep puncturing eggs to eat them and make the Indian government pay for it. Manish Chandra... isn't that a boring name? I wanted a boring name... should sound like a decent guy... right? Look at her gorgeous hair... fire! Okay 'decent guy', listen... you'll have to get close to the professor now. I'm thinking... people here are so honest... they don't even bolt their doors... I should barge into the professor's house and just run off with his computer. Oh, no... Shenoy Sir has clearly instructed we don't need his computer All we need to do is keep an eye on what he does... who he meets... who he speaks to... The Professor is a nutcase... I'm thinking of entering his house with the girl's help... she's calling me tomorrow morning. Good plan. Is he there? Maybe... Sir, I'm writing a book on the finest Indian minds... I'm just a mad scientist... at least this is what the Indian Government thinks... No, Sir... you are being modest. Okay... if you insist. Tell me what will I have to do? Sir, I want to spend the maximum time possible with you. It will be good for the book. For example, when you make your morning notes... then I can be with you when you leave for college... I can be with you in your office observing your work... seeing your research... We can talk in your house when you come back home... just observe you and be around you, Sir... like a constant companion. Mr Chandra, are you here to write a book on me or to marry me? Zoya, why does this damn Rocket launch himself when he sees me? Hey... don't say that... Rocket is very sweet. But he keeps barking at me. That's because you swore at him. Hey... but I said it in front of you. Don't you like dogs? No... I do like them. Good. Zoya... your hostel. Yes... bye. Zoya... do you want to... like... have dinner? Mr. Writer... are you asking me out on a date? Date? No... I mean... we can have a meal... I'm going out with my friends tonight. Join us... I'll let you pay the bill. Sure. But I hope you won't turn up like this? Like what? You know... dressed like a bumpkin. Just get a little cooler... Keep your foot behind that line. Hey, everybody!! Guys listen... this is my friend Manish... he's from India. Hey Manish, it's your turn... Have you ever thrown darts? Hello... Dude... all three hit bull's-eye! Are you a writer or James Bond? I know... I know... won't happen again. This girl is affecting you, my friend... Don't be silly... it's a part of my job. Fine... and don't drink too much. Okay... mummy dear... bye Oh, so sweet... was that your mother on the line? Come on, guys... we're going to Mike's party. Do you wanna come? - No, no... Come on, ya... it will be fun... No... you enjoy... you go. You guys carry on... I'll see you later. Okay, bye! Cheers! Bye! Hey, but please don't stay because of me... Why? Now you don't want to pay for my dinner? No, not Ree... Dee... Ta-ng-dee Tang-Ree Tang... Tang-dee... That's what I said... Tang-ree Do as I say... bend your tongue upwards and touch it to the roof of your mouth... like this... and now hit your front two Bugs Bunny teeth with it... Dee! Ree... Dee... - Tang-dee... - Correct! See... right? Now place the order... - Okay... Two... Tang-ree kebabs Go ahead, my friend... get Tang-ree kebabs... No problem, Sir. You know what? You don't look like a writer. For example... your hands... they are not like a writer's... they're cut and bruised like a wrestler's. Why did you become a writer? Just followed my heart. Very few people follow their hearts... you're lucky. The most important thing for an agent is... that he should use his head and not his heart. The day you follow your heart, consider yourself dead. I admire a man who follows his heart. Tang-dee kabab for you, Sir... and ma'am... for you Tang-ree... enjoy. What the hell, Gopi... you kept coughing... what if she saw you... I've reached... I'll call you back. But Tiger... he could have been a burglar. No, Gopi... the way he attacked me... he was obviously trained. Someone is reacting on seeing me with the Professor. Boss, things are not good here. We'll have to wrap this up quickly. That's why we're here. How's this? What will you do with it? It's a gift. And it's a gift for whom? For Zoya... to say thank you. Wow, Tiger! You've used people all over the world and discarded them since when have you started saying thank you? Gopi... this is a different sort of a mission... here it's important to say thank you. Which mission? Ours? Or have you started another mission? Stop your nonsense and tell me what you think of this. Isn't this too personal? What? I mean... do you know her that well that you can give her a dress? I'm giving her a dress... not taking it off. Tiger... you've never bought a gift... ...for a girl ever in your life... have you? Never. Then what's going on here? What? Hey... it's extremely important to woo Zoya for this mission. What? Don't get wooed yourself in the process. Hi, Zoya... Hi... Hope you're not busy? Lighting design for the show... is that gift for me? Yes. Really? Is it really for me? Yes... but honestly this is the first time I've given a gift to a girl. In these matters I'm a bit of a... like you say... bumpkin. That's really sweet of you... can I open it now? - Yes. How do you know that... Your room had so many things with stars and stuff? You don't like it? No, Manish... I really like it... Then why are you crying? It reminds me of someone... Hey, Zoya, do you want to give me the spotlight cue? Yes, sure... just give me one second. Okay, switch on track number 9... I'll show you the path. One second... Will you help me? I can't do it alone. But I don't know how to dance. No one is asking you to dance. Just hold me and follow me. Oh... come on. Manish... Music is over. What happened? My head is spinning. Wanderer... Wanderer My heart's a wanderer From the moment I saw her My heart became a wanderer Neither awake nor asleep My heart's a wanderer When she smiles I forget everything See... My heart has gone wayward Wanderer... Wanderer For her melodies My heart became a wanderer Wanderer... Wanderer For her melodies My heart became a wanderer She breezes gently past my heart Her words are a mystery to me When she laughs... colourful butterflies take flight It's like being struck by lightning I have surrendered my heart Wanderer... Wanderer For her melodies My heart became a wanderer Her words cast a magical spell Her words cast a magical spell Her eyes are an artist's delight I've dreamt a hundred dreams about her And still I'm restless to see her I would give up the world for her Wanderer... Wanderer For her melodies My heart became a wanderer Wanderer... Wanderer For her melodies My heart became a wanderer What are you doing? What am I doing? Were you just dancing? Dancing? Are you crazy? Who was dancing? Forget the girl... get Rocket. Let's go. One damned dog has made a kitten out of Tiger. Bloody mouse! Zoya... will you come out with me tonight? Why are you running? - Because you're on a cycle. What happened? Can we meet tonight? Tonight? Tonight... tonight is very important. Mr. Writer... so you are asking me out on a date? Yes, Zoya Zee... When and where? Central Park... at 11 sharp... At 11? 11 p.m. Is very important. Okay. Rocket? Hey! Don't misbehave with elders! Hey... if you bite me your teeth will break. Good boy, Rocket... Good boy, Rocket... good boy... Good boy, Rocket... Hi... Have you got Professor Kidwai for the date as well? I told you I'd get you to be friends with Rocket... see... it's done... now he'll never bark at you. Zoya Zee... come, I want to show you something... Come Rocket, come, come. What? How sweet... so you called me here to see this? Such a meteor shower happens only once in 20-25 years... do you know when the last such shower was? 16th June 1991... at 11:55... I was 6 years old... my father had an old Willy's jeep... we would drive out of the city... to see stars... He would tell me that watching stars makes people happy... because all your loved ones eventually become stars in the sky... and bless us from up there. As a child I used to enjoy hearing such stories. Zee, where is your father? Which one? That one... Wow... right next to my father. What was your father's name? Nazar Jung... Nazar, Sir... What shall I hide from you... you are seeing everything from there... after all, your name means sight. Honestly... I'm a little slow in certain matters... I think that's why your daughter calls me a bumpkin. Honestly... I want to convey something to your daughter... but I don't know how to... So, Mr Nazar, what should I do according to you... any tips? Manish... What do you want to tell me? Hey, caveman... Is everything alright? I need a drink. What the hell are you saying? Can't people like us fall in love? Of course we can... but not on a mission. When are we not on a mission? And do we have a life beyond these missions or not? Mission! Is Zoya also? Zoya likes that writer Manish Chandra... I am neither Manish... nor am I a writer... who am I? I've changed so many names that I don't even remember what my parents named me. What are you saying, Tiger? Tiger... Tiger... Tiger... Shenoy Sir called me that once... and now everyone calls me that. Tiger is a name meant for dogs. I warned you... in an attempt to woo her don't get wooed yourself in the process. Say thank you now... Should I tell you something... You've chosen a nice girl (sister-in-law)... It's five in the morning... get some sleep... it's her play in the evening. Sorry... Sorry... Excuse me? In ten minutes you've destroyed half of Dublin... and that agent got away too... what the hell are you doing, Tiger? What else could I have done in that situation? And that guy would have come to know that I'm not a writer. Not just him... the whole town will know you're not a writer. Where will the Professor be right now? Must be watching the play... what else? Do one thing... you go there... ...you'll stay safe from the police as well. I'll speak to Shenoy Sir on a secure line and then call you. Alright. - Keep your phone on... - Alright. And listen... get your face fixed. Yes... I'll do that. And listen... keep this. Anything else? Not at all... after destroying everything... You please go ahead and enjoy the play with dear sister-in-law. Yes, Gopi? Tiger... there's some activity at the Professor's house. But the Professor is here. That's what I'm saying... you head there... there seems to be some trouble. - Oh, shit! Put your hands behind your head... turn around... slowly. Zoya... But you were at the play? What business do you have with the Professor? So, you're here to interview the Professor? What do you do? You don't look like a writer. Oh my God! So you want to spend some time with Professor Kidwai? Agent... ISI... right? Get up... Sit down. You're an agent... and clearly a very good one at that... so you must be aware... of what we do in such situations... still... I'll tell you... you have two options... either you work with us... and give us all the information... or... I'll have to... right here... I will not betray my country... So that leaves me with just one choice... and for you too. My name is not Manish... and I'm not a writer... besides these two things... everything I told you was true. All I want to know from you is... what I saw in your eyes... was that a lie too? I was just doing my job... and nothing else. Tiger... you end up killing someone on every assignment... we didn't want this on this assignment. Sir, the situation was really bad there... it was either me or their agent. Police found their agent's body... I hope you haven't left any trails? No, Sir... and I retrieved the hard disk as well... I've submitted it to Joshi. File your report as well. Tiger... Are you ready for your next assignment? Sir... I'm slightly tired of field operations. If you deem it fit... you can assign me to a desk job for a few days. I'm Zoya... friends call me Zee. I'm Manish Chandra. My friends call me Doordarshan. Touch it to the roof of your mouth and hit it... Dee! Ree! Dee. Tang-dee... - Correct? Right? Now place the order. Very few people have the courage to follow their heart You are lucky. Hey, sonny! Yes, Mr. Bagga? Working hard? Where are you planning to go now? Nowhere, Mr. Bagga... Nothing is happening. Come... let me drop you home then. Sure, let's go. - Come You know, sonny... the UN Foreign Ministers' meeting is about to take place in Istanbul. And we've intercepted a message that the Pakistani delegates are likely to raise the Kashmir issue again. Ever since then... Mr. Shenoy has asked me to monitor every known Pakistani source. And for the past 20 days these random messages have messed up my mind. To make things worse... they have set their codes based on our film stars. Tell me, who is supposed to be Mallika Sherawat in the government? I understand if they say Gulshan Grover or Amrish Puri. And not just films... they are now into television as well. One message has been intercepted every day for the past 20 days. That Zee TV will surely cover the conference, but will Doordarshan also be there? I just don't get it... what's their connection with Doordarshan? Who watches Doordarshan in any case? Mr. Bagga, I want to see those intercepts now! See... I intercept all this every day. Sonny... what are you looking for? You need my help? You asked for a desk assignment... So why do you want to go to Istanbul all of a sudden? Sir, you know that there are more spies than diplomats in these conferences. Sir, there will be officials from all over the world... Sir, it's a gold mine of intelligence information. How can I miss this, Sir? Okay, Tiger... pull out your suits and let's go to Istanbul! Expectations are high as the Indian and Pakistan Foreign Ministers... On the sidelines of the UN Foreign Ministers' Meeting at Istanbul... It is anticipated that the Indian and Pakistan foreign ministers may have an informal meeting. This is good news for the bilateral relations of the two countries. Get out of here... my people will arrive soon. Go... Go! Bored? Hey... who are you? Don't worry, I'm a friend of her's. Drive towards the Old Town. Old Town... okay? Okay. Why have you called me here, Zoya? Tell me, Zoya. It was very easy for you to put a gun to my head and tell me that you love me... wasn't it? As simple as that? If the gun was in your hand... I would have still said the same thing. It's not as easy as you think... the other agent who you killed... Feroz... he was also right there. A girl... whose training and duty forbids her from falling in love... to whom could she say that yes, she too was in love? To the man whose real name she didn't know? To the man who was pointing a gun at her? And even had I said that... what good would it have done? The two of us can never be together. And what does it mean to be together? That we come and shake hands every month at the Wagah border? Or send song requests for one another on All India Radio? I'm ISI... you're RAW. We are enemies. Our duty won't let us be together. Our people won't let us be together. You know they'll come after us. Yes, Captain Abrar... I'm coming there... Yes, sure... fine. The sky Yours and mine Like our dreams Has turned to smoke The sky Yours and mine Like we breathe Has turned to dust Wherever you go You will find me too I am now a part of you I am a Ionely planet You are a Ionely planet Let us come together Beyond the world of stars I am a Ionely planet You are a Ionely planet Let us come together Beyond the world of stars You caved me You carved me Because of you I believe in me You are not here And that be true But if I'm here You are here too Wherever you go You will find me too I am now a part of you I am a Ionely planet You are a Ionely planet Let us come together Beyond the world of stars I am a Ionely planet You are a Ionely planet Let us come together Beyond the world of stars Hi... where have you been? Thank you, Sir. You were gone all evening. I was following a lead, Sir. Relax. Can I please have the pleasure of this dance? I'm sorry but it's not correct for me to... What the hell is Tiger doing? This is a peace conference... diplomats from all over the world are dancing with each other. Why are Indian and Pakistani diplomats stuck in their corners? This is not our protocol... I'm sorry. If you don't mind... Thank you. What the hell do you think you are doing? Zoya... you were right... the world will never let us be together... so let's create our own world... let's run away, Zoya. You have gone mad... don't talk nonsense. God alone knows how long our two countries will keep fighting... we cannot wait for them endlessly. And it might be a little difficult to run when we're old. What happens to our lives after this music ends... ...is all in your hands, Zoya. Tiger... Tiger... hurry up... we have to go to the airport! Hello... Zoya, are you there? We're getting late for the airport. Please hurry and come down. Sir, we can't get through to Tiger's phone. He's out of reach... Sir... I think he's been kidnapped by the Pakistanis. Kidnapped! Nonsense! He's too good for them. Listen... this news should not get out. Okay, Sir. Gopi, where have you been? Take the next flight from London and get here. Which bank has he withdrawn the money from? How much? Sir... a total of 47 thousand dollars, Sir... 47 thousand dollars? Sir... about 2.3 million Rupees. Should be 2.3 million... the day I retire... I'll blow it all up. Tiger has not been kidnapped! Do you have any idea... how much classified information Tiger has about our organisation? If anyone gets hold of that information... it will compromise the security of our agents all over the world. Sir... I don't know exactly where Tiger is or what he's up to... but he will never give away that kind of information whilst he's alive... I'm certain about that. Sir... we just heard that... a Pakistani delegate is also missing since this morning. What? Zoya? This is the address of the hotel. Okay. This hotel belongs to his friend. He'll help us book the tickets for tomorrow. How long will you take? Might take a long... maybe all night... you take care. Sir... this is Zoya. Gopi... do you know how many countries are there in the world? Sir? There are 201 countries in the world... and bloody Tiger could find a girl only from Pakistan? Captain Abrar... why have you called me here? Meeting like this can derail the whole plan. Because I'm worried about you... he is an extremely dangerous agent. I am fine... but you will all have to be a little more patient. It's not that easy to trick him. What you're saying is right... but we must know what you are up to and where exactly are you? He does not suspect me at all... but to get him to you here is too risky. I'll get him to you, but not here... there are too many Indians here... Iooking for him. I'll bring him to the airport in a little while. We'll catch the 10:30 flight to Kazakhstan. This is my disguise. He'll be with me in disguise as well. You can take our picture at the airport and send it to your Kazakhstan station. After that... he's all yours. Take care of yourself... Oh, my God! For a second I couldn't recognise you... But I clearly recognised you. Tickets done... Passports done. Ready to go. Listen to me carefully... there on the right... there's a man in a black jacket with a red suitcase who's having coffee... he's an ISI agent. There at the luggage counter... the guy with the camera... behind him the man on the phone... he's ISI as well. Come with me... our flight has been announced. But our flight still has an hour to go. We're not going to Kazakhstan. Then where are we going? Let's see. Come quickly. You knew all along? I was an agent before I became a lover. But I had to do this because of your drama at the ballroom that day... Captain Abrar saw you and said... this prey has happily walked to a trap. And right then... he made a plan to get you. But if you saw me with Captain Abrar... then why did you come to the airport with me? Zoya... all my life I've used only my head... for once I followed my heart... I just wanted to see where this decision would take me. I'm amused at the thought of what will happen in Kazakhstan now. Seen anyone like her? See there... in that car. They look like bloody Indians. Pakistani goons... Captain Abrar... Gopi, Sir... Sir... it's been close to four hours since the Istanbul flight landed... and no one has shown up. Alright... Sir... the information about Kazakhstan was wrong. No one arrived there today. There were two other big flights that left Istanbul yesterday. One to London and the other to Frankfurt. Then find out from there how many other flights departed... Sir... there are 623 flights at London and 612 flights at Frankfurt scheduled to take off today... total number of passengers 825,802... and those two could be traveling on a passport of any nationality... I don't care... keep searching... we have to find them. Sir... my point is... if Tiger has decided... then it will be very difficult to find him. We have created Tiger! RAW was functioning before him... and will continue even after him. Gopi... the amount of information that Tiger has about our organization... before ISI gets to that information... we have to find Tiger and bring him back. And... if he doesn't want to return? Then I'm sure you know what we must do... Just remember... no one should be able to identify his body. Keep your eyes closed And count slowly Find me for I don't know where I am Forgotten are our tales We are strangers to our own land See how we have turned into thin air Close to the heart Under the sheet of dreams Is this lost world Of ours I am lost You are lost All our senses Are all lost Yes this is my wish To think of only you The glow that emanates from you Will remain captured in my dreams When did morning fall asleep? When did the stars awaken? We have forgotten what happens when I am lost You are lost All our senses Are all lost Yes I was breathing But I was never alive When I gave my heart away to you I realized what a heartbeat was Immersed in you Lost in you Away from you Where do I go? I am lost You are lost All our senses Are all lost What does it mean? Sane love... is no love. Wow! Give me your money! Give me your money! Give me your money! Zoya... let's get out of here. Zoya... let's get out of here. What language is it? Is it Arabic? No, not Arabic... sounds like... Hindi or Bengali... Spoken in India... Pakistan... Bangladesh... Afghanistan... Dayal... Why have you sent me this? Don't send me Embassy correspondence. You should be able to handle this at your level. My brains get fried with all this nonsense... and especially when I'm ready to go home... Which embassy? Havana, Sir... Cuba. Honeymoon's over... Tiger. We're being watched. Eleven o' clock. You are right... we are being watched. Can you please come back in 20 minutes? Yes, Zoya? They are saying that they need the manager's authorisation for such a big amount... and he's not there... right now they can only give half of that amount. Okay... get that for now. The manager will be back in 20 minutes... this is all I could get. I will get a car with the money... you withdraw the rest of the money from the bank... don't worry... we'll be out of here by evening. Police please? Stop now... you've run enough. Zoya... look what I found... Willy's jeep... the same '52 model. Oh... I'm sorry, I didn't mean to remind you of your father. What happened? It's over... They were waiting for you... we have to go and sit in that car. Tiger, don't try anything here... I know... they will kill us here if they have to. Come... No! Follow them... fast! Hurry up! Come on. Hey, stop. Wait... wait. Thank you. Tiger... Tiger, come on! Fast! Stop it, Zoya! Enough! What is it that they have and we don't? Five minutes are more than enough... I don't care... If you have to shoot him... then do it I'll call you back. So, Gopi... you want me to be shot? You deserve to be shot. What have I done? - What have you done? Tiger, do you know how many countries there are in the world? 201 countries... there are 201 countries and you... 203... after Kosovo separated from Serbia. Okay... 203 countries and you... No... 204... because Montenegro also separated from Serbia. I don't care whether there are 203 or 204 countries! How can you elope with a Pakistani? Gopi... do you know how much information Zoya can provide us? Do you have any idea? Zoya is ready to come to India with us. Really? Then where is she? Call her... let's leave. For that I'll need you and your boys. Why? You just told me that she's ready. Yes but those people who she is with right now won't let her come to India that easily. Who are they? Our friends... So let me get this straight... you want us to attack the ISI in Cuba... why... to kidnap a girl? Girl? The same girl was your sister-in-law in Dublin... when you found out she was a Pakistani... you demoted her from sister-in-law to just a girl? Gopi... they are flying her to Pakistan tomorrow morning... Hey caveman... whatever needs to be done, should be done now. What will Shenoy Sir say? Tiger... Tiger... Tiger... What the hell is Tiger doing? That's the plan... Tokas, you will be here. Sir... - Bablu... you'll be at this point... Ok, Sir - Jassi, you will block them from here. Tiger... take this. - Thanks, Gopi... You, caveman... you got an entire army just to catch me? Sir... don't forget we came here to catch that man from whom we learnt everything. One last time... you'll be here. - Yes, sir. Tomorrow morning sharp at eight. Our flight will take off in two hours... don't try anything strange at the airport. Nothing is more precious in the world for a woman... than her honour and dignity. And that Indian friend of yours... he left you alone and disappeared really fast? Come on, come on! Come on, come on! Go, go! Hurry! Follow them, quick! You rascal... God made you and broke that mould! Sister-in-law! Turn around! Now! Turn left! Come on, go go! Airpark! Come on! Move fast! Stop! Stop there! I will make it... don't worry about me... don't stop the plane for anything... we'll get just this one chance for take off! Go, go, go! Cut them off! Hey, pilot... fly me to a safe place. Hello... Hello? Shenoy Sir... Speak up... Avinash Singh Rathore. You've called me by my real name for the very first time... You've shown your true colours for the first time... No, Sir... for the first time in my life I truly followed my heart. You forgot your duty. No, Sir... I never forget my duty... I remember my duty... my training... but I also understand that beyond them Tiger is a human being too... You yourself said once... it's not easy to live with regrets. To love your enemy is treachery... Sir... when I was falling in love... no one told me she was the enemy... and when I fell in love... I couldn't understand why she was the enemy. Tiger... - Sir... How long will you keep running away? Sir... the day India and Pakistan don't need RAW and ISI... that day we will come back. Good luck. Shenoy Sir Agent Tiger and Agent Zoya have been listed as 'missing'... in the files of RAW and ISI. But reports of them being seen... have been reported from all over the world. However, it's impossible to say if they were actually Tiger and Zoya. RAW and ISI have been searching for them all over the world. For the first time in their history... these rival agencies have worked together on a mission. Whichever corner of the world Tiger and Zoya might be in... they must be smiling upon hearing this news.
