A DAIEI PRESENTATION A TAKECHI FILM PRODUCTION The Nikkō Tōshō-gū is one of many Cultural Heritage sites created by the Japanese People. There's no other building as loved by the people, nor as showered with such words of praise. Thus sang Bashō, the poet, about it: Oh, how glorious! The lush greenery, young leaves And the bright sunlight What did such a talented man think was "glorious"? The people. They gather together like the lush greenery and young leaves, and live their lives without standing out. And by doing that, they created a magnificent work of art, which shines as brightly as the sunlight. The crystallization of the common folks' wisdom. Bashō felt that this imagination and energy was something glorious. The Tōshō-gū was built in the Kan'ei era. And, a hundred years after that, on the third year of the Kan'en era, it came time for it to be restored. One of the Shogun's counselors at the time, Sagami-no-Kami Hotta, ordered Shunga Kanō, the shogunate's official artist, to repair the temple's painting. However, by spending too many years enjoying their status within the shogunate, the Kanō School lost all their creativity. And their work became an empty imitation of what it had once been. Thus, he no longer had the skill required to repair the Nikkō temple's beautiful colors. Starting to plunge into despair, he thought of asking an Ukiyo-e artist, Chōshun Miyagawa, for help. He'd heard Chōshun Miyagawa was a genius, and his work with colors was especially fascinating. Besides that, Chōshun had researched the original methods of Yamato-e, and adding his own original ideas, he had the grit to call himself Chōshun Miyagawa, A dauntless painter. Shunga Kanō bore witness to Chōshun Miyagawa's prowess. And thus Chōshun's misfortune began. This, to this day, is considered to be the most tragic and cruel case of artist suppression in history. However, even after authority fades away, art remains living forever.

No, not like that. Twist your body more. - Like this? - No... No, that's not quite it. Ms. Okita. This is an erotic painting to be given to the daughter of Lord Hotta, the shogun's counselor, in celebration of her marriage being decided upon! I want to make this a classy, beautiful piece of art. Anyhow, I'm a country woman. I'm sorry I'm not refined enough! Oh, no, no. Don't be offended. Hear me out, please. It's truthfulness. Yes, that's it. There's not enough truthfulness. Everything that's true is beautiful. Meanwhile, lies and made up things are all vulgar. So, I want you to use your expression and looks- to show how beautiful love truly is. Even so... I have no partner, and I'm not an actress. No, wait. Like that. Hold that pose for a moment. Hello there! Yes? Father? I'm in the middle of work. But, you see... It is on behalf of Mr. Shunga Kanō. What? Shunga? Yes. Shunga Kanō lives in the officials' district, in the central ward of the city. He's the artist tasked with making portraits and paintings for the Shogun and his family. What business would he have with a simple drawer such as myself? Well, that very Lord Kanō, who lives in the officials' district, in the central ward of the city, has sent a servant to tell you what business... I'm working! Tell him to wait. But he says it's urgent. There's no way around it, then. Let him in. - Well, I'll be on my... - You stay right there! Let's try a different angle, this time. That's it. Now, lift your left hand up. Excuse me. Look this way. Oh, my apologies! You pervert! Come on, Ms. Okita! There. If you'd please, state your business here. I am a servant of the Kanō house. My name is Gakei. Sorry for my delayed introduction. I am Chōshun Miwagawa. My master, Shunga Kanō, seems to have something he wants to ask of you. Oh, Lord Kanō wants to ask me, a simple drawer, something? My master's words were the following: "This man named Chōshun..." "He doesn't know anything about painting, neither he has a good style." "But when it comes to coloring, and only that, his work is praiseworthy." And saying that, he ordered me to bring you to his residence immediately. At the moment, I am busy with an urgent request from Lord Hotta, one of the Shogun's counselors. While I do not finish this, I cannot go anywhere. Oh, no, actually this request also is on behest of Lord Hotta, so I was told to bring you, no matter what. What? It is for Lord Hotta? Correct. I have no choice, then. If it is a request from master Kanō, who retains even the emperor's favor, I cannot possibly refuse. - Then, let us go. - No. I'll go tomorrow morning. I am in the middle of work right now. Ms. Okita, your face needs a little more expression! How about this one? Bleh! Oh, I don't know about that! That looks a bit childish! By order of our Lord, the Shogun's counselor, Sagami-no-Kami Hotta, and of mysef, Shunga Kanō, you are to be responsible for the task of repairing the painting- during the renovations of the Nikkō Tōshō-gū. You should paint something for the living quarters, as well. Yes, sir. As you are aware, the Kanō School's art style captures that which is sacred, by means of ink painting. That makes it unsuitable for a building as colorful as the Tōshō-gū. You might be a vulgar drawer, but your coloring work is praiseworthy. You've been given a very important job- by Lord Hotta and myself. It is a rare opportunity, so make sure to do your best, and do not waste it. Yes, sir. That is what was requested of me. I am very honored by this. And so, I, Chōshun, have deciced to accept this work of the repainting in Nikkō, but you do not have to move there with me. I will do what you ask of me, father. - I will follow the young master. - As will I. - Congratulations. - Yes, congratulations. This is idiotic! Kanō has good standing, but his work is bad. If he didn't ask our master for help, he would not be able to repair the Tōshō-gū! There's nothing we have to thank him for. What are you saying, Isshō? Mind your words! But am I wrong? The Kanō School made their name on lies, with empty imitations! That will, in time, wear out Japanese art. Doesn't our master always teach us that- his work merely shows the truth of Japanese people?! Now, just because a bureaucrat like Kanō says so, we're supposed to follow his orders? That's right. It is as Isshō says. Right, Ms. Okyō? What is it with you? This is a time for celebration. Do you intend to cast a bad omen on it, Isshō?! Wait. It is not like Isshō is not saying the truth. What are your thoughts, father? Isshō... Those painting in the splendid building, that is the Tōshō-gū, were actually made by the real artists who were our elders. How could we let the Kanō School which was built on lies, try to repair or mend the splendid work... that those people left behind? Our brushes are the only ones... that can do justice to the beautiful art they left, in the right way! I didn't accept the offer because I want better standing, or for profit. You understand, don't you? - Isshō. - Yes? I am bad at painting, but I can at least help you mix colors or something! Let's all put our hearts together, and show the Kanō School the power of us commoners! - Yes. - Yes. Well, that settles it, then. We will leave Edo and burrow ourselves the mountains of Nikkō! Everyone, finish up all the work you have pending! - Yes. - Yes. If Chōshun accepts it, then I will also be satisfied. Great. - However, Kanō... - Yes, sir? There's the matter of the payment... Let's see, it would be Chōshun, plus his disciples. In total, I believe there should be around 1500 people to pay for. Other than that, there's the gold paint and the gold leaves, the ultramarine color, the patina, the cinnabar... There might also be other expensive colors and materials needed. - Listen, Kanō. - Sir? The Hotta House has many distractions to deal with, such as commoners' petitions and rebelions. I have my hands full as it is. So, you decide what to do with this. Yes. Well, then, in the Kan'ei period, the construction cost 600.000 ryō. If it's ten percent of that, it'll be 60.000 ryō. It will be that much? For the time being, let's pay a deposit of 10.000 ryō. And then, as for the remaining 50.000 ryō, I shall force Chōshun to accept a delayed payment. What was that? Shush! Be quiet. My father is working. What?! It's a bit dark in here, isn't it? Oei... You are my treasure. There's no truth... There's no truth, at all... It's not truthful. Ms. Okyō, please put these paintings in that package. Yes. - Dear? - Huh? What do we do with this? Oh, have Isshō and Katsushige organize it. Ah, let me do it. Oh, young master. What happened, Isshō? Why are you so gloomy? It's about that painting I showed you the other day, of that beautiful woman. Oh, that was a masterpiece! It's your most important work so far! Is there a problem with it? I'm not satisfied with it yet. Before we depart for Nikko, I want to meet with Shizan, the prostitute, again, so I can remake the sketch! Is that so? But I don't have money. Come on, cut it out! Constraint doesn't suit you. Here, take this and go. - Thank you! - Come on. Brother! Why did you give Isshō that money? Are you jealous, Okyō? No! However... Our father has already decided in his heart that Isshō will be your husband. I'm not fit to be an artist's son. I am bad at painting, and I'm a fighter who likes kendo. There's no one fit to continue the Miyagawa line but him. So, why would you give him money to go to the red light district?! He went there to paint a prostitute named Shizan. Isshō likes her, doesn't he? That kind of feeling is also important for an artist. You have to understand. Right, Okyō? I don't, and I won't! You're an idiot, brother! When will I be able to see you again? Once I go off to Nikkō, I won't return for at least a year. Tonight, we shall say farewell, for some time. Isshō... I can't wait that long! I only came tonight because of my young master's sympathy. He is the one who granted us this meeting. If you can't stay in Edo, then I shall pay my own fee, so I can go meet with you. You don't have to do that for me. At least, I will have this sketch of you. I am full of debts, anyway. If I were to move to Nikkō... or wherever to be with you, what would you do? Shizan! Okyō. Okyō! Yes? You called for me, father? Okyō... You're my daughter, aren't you? What are you saying, all of a sudden? You have it in your heart... to give up your own body... for the benefit of art, right? Yes. There's an erotic picture I have to paint for Lord Hotta, and the day of his daughter's wedding is approaching. It is urgent that I finish it. On top of that, I must depart for Nikkō in a few days. However, the sketches I have done thus far are lacking in elegance. There's no truth to them! If the young lady lays her eyes upon a picture that shows a man and a woman, a wife and a husband, having relations and finds it repulsive, my name will be forever stained. Okyō, your father is asking you from the bottom of his heart. Let me portray your body! Please, to protect your father's honor as an artist, show me your nude body! The grace and elegance you have as a maiden, are exactly what I am looking for! There's not enough movement like that. There's no life! Show me the expression of someone who is dreaming a beautiful dream. It's not natural. Not true. Can't you do any better? It's a lie! It's false! I apologize for not knowing anything... Isshō... Isn't Isshō around? Katsushige. - Where's Isshō? - Sir... He went out somewhere, and hasn't returned yet. You'll have to do. Come in and embrace Okyō. What?! It seems I need a man here for my portrait. What are you waiting for? But...! It's for the benefit of art. Hurry up and embrace Okyō. Yes! Katsushige! Hurry up! I'm sorry, Ms. Okyō. Katsushige! Is that the real form of how a man and a woman look together? Sir? Hold her tighter! Until I can see the ecstasy on her face! Yes! Do not forget the heart of a real artist, Katsushige. Yes! No... Father, I am a person! I can't do what repulses me! I can't show ecstasy like this! What I need is truth! If you don't want it, push Katsushige away! Fight him with all you have! In that, too, there is the truth of man and woman! And the truth is what moves people's hearts! I don't want it! I don't want it! Katsushige... Are you feeling timid? Where is your artist's heart?! Ms. Okyō... Please, forgive me! No! No! Stop it, Katsushige! No! Stop it! No! No! No! Stop! Let me go! Stop this! No... no! Katsushige, you monster! No! Stop it, no! Help me! Brother! Brother! Help me! No! Oh my! Katsushige! Get a hold of yourself! Father is in the middle of work! Isshō, help me! Please, hurry! Why, when your bride needs you the most, you aren't here?! Hurry up and come back home! No! Katsushige, stop it! Please, stop it! Damn it! What is happening? Am I disconnected from my body and heart? And am I floating through the skies, like a cloud? Or a bird? Am I one with my body and with my heart? Or perhaps... is this... a bad dream? Or a good one? You should get dressed. It's not good for you. I don't want to give this night to anyone else! I don't want to go, either. However, that is how life is. I cannot stay. It's not like this is goodbye forever. It is. I feel like it is, somehow, and it hurts so much I can't bear it! Shizan! Who is it? You made me wait... You were having some fun, weren't you? Oh, Mr. Gakei. When did you arrive? Thank you for coming to see me. Oh, it's still nice and warm! And it still smells of you! Mr. Gakei, please wait in the hallway. But I'm so tired of waiting! There's nothing I can do, because you like Isshō better. But hurry up and come here to me! - What are you doing? - You don't ever show it to Isshō, but let me take a look at your skin this one time! No! The rules of the red-light district say I can never undo my sash, or show my skin to a customer at the shop. But then, you don't show Isshō your naked body, either? I just did, before you came in. What did you say? That's the difference between a lover and a customer. You're provoking me! What happened, Okyō? Isshō, is that you? Rejoice! Now I can finally paint it! Thanks to Okyō, I can fix what was wrong with that painting! Milady, our Lord has come to see you. Daughter, how are you feeling? I really don't like it one bit after all, father! It's disgusting and scary! If I must be married to someone, I would rather you let me run away from home! Come on, now, there's no need to fret. To make you feel better about this whole thing, the ukiyo-e artist, Chōshun Miyagawa, painted the most beautiful picture just for you. I'm sure your heart will feel relieved once you see it. Oh, my, it is so beautiful! I never even dreamed that marriage, that the relationship between a man and a woman, could be so beautiful and noble. Chōshun, is it? I thank you. Your painting gave me hope and courage to live. Now, I'll be able to marry, without feeling any fear or shame. Isshō, could you look at this, please? Is this the right color of patina? Oh, I'll check it for you, Okyō! Isshō. - Isshō! - Oh, Shizan! You are a prostitute. What are you doing here? I wanted to see you, Isshō! What really happened? I wanted to see you so much... that I moved to Imaichi Post Town. So, you're living at Imaichi Post Town now? You let go of your high status as a courtesan in the Edo red-light district... - For me? - Yes. I am full of debts, and can't do much of my life, anyway. But I thought that, if I came to a place a little closer, I could at least see you again! Forgive me. Have you been there long? It's been exactly one month. I thought we'd meet in that time, that you'd come there... But you haven't been able to go out, right? No. I have been stuck here in the mountains with my master, and the other disciples for the whole year. I am at a place called Asagaya, in Imaichi. - Make sure to come see me! - Sure... I want to, but I have no money. That bastard Kanō keeps saying Lord Hotta hasn't sent him money, so he hasn't paid us a single mon yet! So, sneak in through the back door. Yes. I could do that... However, Lord Hotta is coming to inspect our work tomorrow. - Until that is over, I can't go. - Tomorrow night, then. Yes. Hey, Otama! - Otama! - It's the proprietess. I'm here! - Otama, hurry up! - That's it, then. - What's taking this long? - Tomorrow, I'll leave the back door open. - I'm here! - Come with us! Otama, hurry up! - Shunga. - Milord. That man is Chōshun Miyagawa. I see. Splendid work, Chōshun! Thanks to your repainting, the whole shrine has come to life once again! I am glad to hear such kind words! And what of the living quarters, Chōshun? Of course! That has been done, as well! I want to see it soon. Come and take me there. Let's see what you can really do. What terrible penmanship! It is clear you have no knack for this! Even if they can fix colors, like a plastering craftsman, there's no way they could actually paint something from scratch! It's all sticky and flabby! All sticky and flabby! Looks like an earthworm, doesn't it? Chōshun! What style does this painting belong to? That's right! This is the style of pornography! Of erotic paintings! A style suited to painting filthy naked women, with the elegance of manure! - Right? - Indeed! As he says, this is in the style of pornography, of erotic paintings! Isshō, don't! - Don't. - That's right! That's right! Chōshun! Don't you think you have defiled the mausoleum... of the gracious Tōshō Daigongen?! With all due respect, I call myself a Japanese painter. If you ask me what style my art is, I can't call it anything other than "Japanese Style." I was born in Japan, and raised in Japan. I saw the things which exist in Japan with my own eyes! That is what a Japanese painter is! I paint that which I see. The mountains are as I saw! The flowers are as I saw them! And the women, too! I paint them as they truly are! I do not paint empty works, nor do I make mere imitations such as yourself, Lord Kanō! The colorless and lifeless style of the Kanō School sumi-e would never be enough to repair the Tōshō-gū! What did you say? You insolent! Shunga, restrain yourself! Everything Chōshun said is true. These peonies, above all, are gorgeous! I have to compliment you. You might think so, milord, but... I, as a person born and raised in Edo, cannot accept this which he has delivered! The deadline for the renovations is the day of the memorial service, which is tomorrow. Can you, with your own hands, paint a richly colored painting of peonies as beautiful as this until then?! Can you, Shunga? Chōshun. I presume it was a long, hard labor. You did splendidly. - Master. - What? Congratulations on your important task, and on seeing it through to the end. You all did a good job, too. It's rude if you don't say that. I want you to relax, now! Thank you, sir! But even though it's such a joyous occasion, that Chōshun Miyagawa fella is the one thing that I keep thinking about! Don't talk about that, or the booze will taste bad! I want to get revenge on him so badly! That's true! If we let this slide, we'll regret it for a long time! Don't say that. We will have our revenge. - Huh? - What? The money. What money are you talking about? The paints and gold leaves that dreaded Chōshun used, and the fee for their labor. I have the power to decide whether I pay for it or not, and when. I see, and you won't until he withdraws his criticism, right? That is great! Hey, Shizan, the prostitute! Oh, I mean... Ms. Otama! Are you breaking the rules with your lover right now? If you do have a lover, maybe I should make you two get married! You're probably hurrying to get ready and all scared now, aren't you?! Now, come on! Come on, let's go. Let's have a lot of fun! You are so funny, milord! Welcome! Otama, what happened? You are incredibly late! Oh, yes. I have a bit of a headache... This is the one they call Otama, huh? Yes, that is right! She's almost as good to be someone's wife. I wouldn't imagine there was such a courtesan around Imaichi. That's true. Before, she worked as a prostitute in the Edo red-light district under the name of Shizan. Have you been with her, Gakei? Ye... I mean, no! Nope. Proprietess, can I take this woman with me? You jest, I'm sure. You wish to take a woman from a post town, milord? Well, a man such as Shunga Kanō cannot be seen sleeping with a woman at a whorehouse in Imaichi, now, can I? If I take her to my mansion, then I don't need to worry what others may think. Right, Gakei? As you say, sir. Well, then... I must ask you to buy her freedom. Money? If that's what you want, I have as much as needed! Here. This much should be enough, right? I don't have a single mon for you! I'm deeply sorry, sir, but, on top of the expensive paints we used in large quantities, such as the gold paint, patina and cinnabar, there's also the fee for my disciples' labor, which was 2.000... Silence! It should be obvious that someone of your standing would voluntarily offer to paint the Tōshō-gū for free. Don't you think it is the honor of a lifetime?! Even so, in the 313 days it took us, some of my disciples fell ill, or were incapacitated from the exhaustion. When I think you won't even pay for their hard work, I can't help feeling sorry for... You're free to pay them with what we already gave you! This kind of insolence should not go unpunished! - That's right! - We'll kill you! What have I done? - There you go! - Please, stop! Silence, you insolent! My hand... My precious hand! What the hell did you say? You only paint those filthy erotic paintings, your hands and fingers aren't worth anything! Kill him! Take that! - There you go, you bastard! - You piece of shit! Take that! Let me finish him! Throw him out with the garbage on the construction site out back. He was a piece of trash human after all, right?! Even though the Sun has set, father still hasn't come home... - Should I go get him? - Wait, Isshō! You're too hotheaded. At times like these, my sister should go. Yes, I'll go fetch him. It's dangerous to go alone, at this time. Chōki, go with her. Yes. I shall accompany you, too. - Let's go, Ms. Okyō. - Yes. - Be careful. - Yes. At a time like this, it's gotta be a young person! Take care, then. Father shouldn't have gone alone, either. Excuse me. Who's there? - Our master is visiting you. - Huh? Oh, you mean Chōshun? He left some time ago. That is weird. Maybe we missed each other on the way? Let's look around for a while longer. Yes, let's do that. Now, come over here. Yes. But I... Come on, you are no virgin. I'm sorry, please don't! What? You're saying you won't undo your sash? Yes. I never let a cheating man see my naked body. That is my policy. I'm a cheating man? You're a funny one! I'm going to make you cry and beg me to not only undo your sash, but to take off everything. I'll give you a good time! What are you doing? Hey, wait, wait! Come here! Oh, Gakei! Catch her! Hey! Help me out! This wench is saying she won't undo her sash! I want to take the clothes off, and hurt her thoroughly! - Hurry up and undo the sash! - Yes, sir! - I didn't understand much, but... - Please, let go of me! I'll take it off! Alright, I'll take off the sash! Here, I undid my sash! Idiot! Not yours, hers! Oh, you meant hers?! - Hurry up, hurry up! - Yes, sir! Please, don't! Someone, help me! Gakei! What are you doing there? Oh, it's just that she's so feisty and I mean... - It's off! - Let me see. Don't let go of her legs! Hold her! Keep holding! Here! - All right! - You're holding too much! There's no place for me like that! I'm getting tired here! Get me a glass of water! - No! - Hurry up! Keep quiet. Hey, where did you go? Hurry up! Keep quiet, keep quiet. Keep quiet, yes? Hurry up! Here you go! Good, what are you still doing here? Hurry along and get out! - Are you sure, sir? - Get out, now! Yes, sir! Keep quiet. Here I go! - Don't say anything. - Isshō, help me! Isshō! Keep quiet, keep quiet! Isshō... Where did he go? Ms. Okyō, should we go back for now? - Ms. Okyō! - Shush! Be quiet. I can hear his voice! It's that way! Near the construction! Hurry! Father! Father! - Master! - Father! Hang in there! - Father! - Master! Father, who did this horrible thing to you? Say something, father! Who was it? Tell me! Father... - Father! - Master! - Father! Hang in there! - Master! - Master! - Father! Damn it! This must have been Kanō's doing! Go tell master Chōsuke at once! Yes! Chōki, you go tell my brother! I shall go to Kanō's place first, and make this right! - Katsushige, come with me! - Right away! Master... I'll be back for you soon. What are you trying to say? I don't know if Chōshun ran into a thief or whatever after he left, but we aren't responsible for that! No, I am certain you are the ones behind it! - What did you say? - What? You want to pick a fight on a false pretext? - What?! - Katsushige, wait. Bring Lord Kanō out here! - The master has already gone to sleep. - There's something I want to ask him. If you are innocent, summon him at once! - You insolent! - What are you saying? - What's this ruckus? - It's Chōshun's daughter! You're the ones who did that to my father! What did you do to my father? - Katsushige! - Take that! Ah, it hurts! Ouch, it hurts, it hurts! It hurts! It hurts... it hurts... Ah, blood! I'm bleeding, I'm bleeding! Ms. Okyō! - Don't let him go! - Katsushige! - Stop it... - After him! No... Stop! Forgive me, forgive me! Stop! It hurts! It hurts! No, stop! It hurts! Forgive me! Forgive me... No! Forgive me... Cut her sash! Cut it! Forgive me! Forgive me! It hurts! What happened?! I'm in pain... I'm in pain... I'm in pain... It hurts! It hurts so much... Let me go! Forgive me... Forgive me! Forgive me! Forgive me! Forgive me! It hurts... it hurts... I'll finish you off! There's one more injured! Somebody... Somebody help! Isshō... Isshō... Hey, what happened? Ms. Okyō is in danger! They will kill her! What? Okyō will be killed? Let's go, Isshō! Katsushige! Isshō! Okyō! You won't get away! I haven't done anything! I didn't do anything! Ah, Otama! Isshō! Isshō, get down! Otama! Don't die on me! Okyō! I... Okyō! Otama! Young master! Shut up, Isshō! All of tonight's killing... was done by me! I was the one who did it all! Young master! I am here with a report. There was a grave incident in the city! Why are you so flurried? What happened, in the middle of the night? Chōshun Miyagawa was killed by someone tonight. And in revenge his son, Chōsuke, killed Shunga Kanō and his disciples. He committed seppuku shortly afterwards. What? Kanō was killed by Chōshun's son? That is correct, sir. I see... Was there any other artist or swordsman at the scene? Well, there was a man named Isshō at the scene, but he claims he wasn't involved in the crime. That's enough. You can go, now. Yes, sir! I can't let one of those artists live, can I? - What? - Huh? Oh, I'm just thinking aloud. I'll exile this man named Isshō to Miyakejima for the rest of his life. Ofuji. You are so beautiful. I'll take off your sash. Oh, my Lord, is that true? What reason have I to lie? With this, the financial trouble in our domains should settle down. The Kanō House is gone. The Miyagawa School is full of idiots. If I simply pay their fee for repairing the shrine, it'll be over. The commoners shouldn't rebel or make petitions again anytime soon. The criticism of our heavy taxation also should just die out. I accomplished what his Majesty asked. My job as the Shogun's counselor should be secure for the time being. Isshō... - You have to survive, Isshō! - Isshō! Keep on painting! - You're a great artist! - You're amazing! You're the best in Japan! You did well, Isshō! Live on! - You're the God of ukiyo-e! - He's right! I want to be like you! Live on, Isshō! I will... spend the rest of my life... in Miyakejima, alone. Without so much as a pencil to paint, or someone to fall in love with again. THE END
