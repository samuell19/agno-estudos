(electronic whooshing) (chimes jingling) (dramatic beat music) (dramatic instrumental music) (air whooshing) (plane rumbling) (ominous music) - [Men] Trader! Trader! Trader! (metal door thudding) (ominous military music) (crowd shouting) - [Man] I hope you rot in hell! (crowd shouting) (gunshots popping) (explosions rumbling) (ominous military music) (crowd chanting) - [Prisoner] Trader! You'll pay now for killing those civilians! (explosion booming) (soldier screaming) Psycho! (ominous military music) (crowd chanting) Say hello to devil for me! (crowd shouting) (faint Italian opera music) (watch ticking) - Right on schedule. (crowd shouting) (dramatic instrumental music) (faint Italian opera music) - Ah. Music to die for, huh, Warden? - Indeed. You have no idea what a pleasure it was for me to sign your execution order. Show Mr. Carter to his seat. (ominous music) - What's with the camera? - Posterity, Carter. I'm having you logged on to every official database for 10 light years in every direction. A hundred billion witnesses to watch you die. I'm also having you patch into the log on my transport fighter so I can watch it over and over every time I wanted to laugh. - Well, it's getting a little personal, wouldn't you say, Warden? I mean, what did I ever do to you? - Shut up! It's all over for you now. - Oh, it ain't over till the fat lady sings. - Well, I'll be damned. Not a fat lady in sight. - All right, you're in such a big hurry to watch me die, what are we waiting for? - Unfortunately, we're waiting for the priest. He should've been here 10 minutes ago. - You gotta be kidding me. - All regulations stipulate that the condemned man be granted last rites. (Carter chuckling) - I'll pass. - Damn you, Carter. Have you no remorse at all? - For what? - For what? An entire deep space colony massacred by you and your men! (gunshots popping) (suspenseful music) Men, women and children butchered! (gunshots booming) (woman screaming) Families, Carter! Families you were sent there to protect. And you say, for what? For God sake, man, what happened to you? (ominous music) - I got bored? - I hope the devil has a special place for you. And for all your men. You're a disgrace to the uniform. An insult to humanity. An abomination in the eyes of God! - Oh, I don't know about that last one, Warden. You see, I've looked into the eyes of God and you know what I saw there? Anarchy. (foreboding military music) (distant crowd shouting) - Finally. Now we can get on with this. - [Priest] No, son. God offers you salvation. Even at your final hour. I give you absolution, my son. - Ready? - Just coming online with the program now, sir. (electronic beeping) - [Priest] Even though I walk through the shadow of darkness, no evil shall I fear. (dramatic music) - Time to say bye-bye, Carter. - Bye, bye, Warden. (gunshot booming) (Warden groaning) (gunshots booming) (ominous music) (gun cranking) - Guess you've never taken part in a jailbreak before. - [Soldier] No, don't shoot me-- (gunshot booming) (gun cranking) - I guess he never will. (priest laughing) - Get me out of this thing! (Carter groaning) (punch thudding) Cutting it a little close, aren't you, Russell? - Don't complain. Springing a hardcore con from a maximum security prison takes time and money and a little divine intervention. - Speak of the real priest, where is he? - Meeting his maker. (metal clattering) (foreboding music) (glass shattering) (crowd shouting) - Stand back, gentlemen. (bomb beeping) (explosion booming) (siren alarming) (metal clanking) (crowd shouting) All right, what's the transport situation? - The Warden was going on leave. His fighter's in the takeoff slot fueled and ready. (siren alarming) (soldiers shouting) - How far can we get? - As far as we want. There's even sleep pods. - How many? - Six. - Cozy. (siren alarming) - [Solider] Hurry! (guns cranking) - All right, gentlemen, let's get the hell out of here. Prison life is beginning to bore me. (gun cranking) (prisoners cheering) (siren alarming) (suspenseful music) - [Soldier] Move it! Move it! - Let's go! - Move it! - Get him! Hold it right there! (gunshots popping) (siren alarming) (gunshots booming) (bullets clinking) (rapid gunfire popping) (bomb beeping) (explosions rumbling) - Top side! Top side! We have a breach! A maximum security breach! Prisoners are breaking out! All security personnel to the area! (gunshots popping) (suspenseful music) - This isn't one of your better escape plans, is it? - On a scale of one to 10? - Toss me a mine. (gunshots booming) You throw like a girl. (rapid gunfire popping) - [Solider] Upper floor! Upper deck! - [Russell] You still catch like one. (electronic beeping) - I hear a fat lady singing. (Russell laughing) (gunshots popping) - Security, there's a break in progress! (rapid gunfire popping) (bullets clanking) (electronic beeping) - [Man] He's still there! - [Soldier] Watch out! (bullets clinking) (gunshots booming) (explosion rumbling) - [Carter] Let's get out of here now! (electronic beeping) All right, Russell, fire her up! Let's get out of here! (rapid gunfire popping) - [Prisoner] Let's go! We gotta go! Come on! Come on! (electronic humming) (explosions rumbling) (suspenseful music) (ship whooshing) (ominous music) (ship rumbling) (atmosphere rumbling) - July 1st. Day 437. (somber music) Today's my birthday. I'm 18 today. Big deal, it's not like anybody else is gonna notice. (door whooshing) - Ronnie? - What? - Come and see what's happening. - Find another sunspot? - Just come on. You're always cooped up in here. - It's not like I can go outside and get fresh air. - Well you know where we are. (somber music) (door whooshing) - [Ronnie] Maybe they remembered this time. (computer beeping) (door whooshing) - Veronica. - [Man] Hi, Ronnie. - Come here. Look at this. (footsteps thumping) - What am I supposed to be seeing? - Something no human being has ever seen before. A dying star. Isn't it beautiful? - It looks the same as it did yesterday and the day before that and the day before that. (ship humming) - What did you say? - I don't know. I'll be right back. (somber music) (ship rumbling) (mother sighing) Oh, Ronnie. I'm sorry this mission is taking so long. We certainly never expected it to. (electronic beeping) - What's that? - It's probably nothing but you stay here in your room until we call you, okay? (somber music) (ship rumbling) (computer chiming) What is it? - [Commander] It's one of ours. The computer says it's a Military registered fighter. - A fighter? We're light years away from the nearest star base. What the hell is a lone fighter doing way out here? - [Commander] I don't know. (radio buzzing) - We're picking up a lot of interference from the star's magnetic field. They could've scrambled the signal. - We're gonna have to turn this thing around. - That means recalibrating all the instruments. That's gonna set us back days. - [Commander] What else can we do? He's headed straight into the sun. - All right, let's do it. (computer chiming) Veronica, buckle up. We're gonna be firing the thrusters for a few seconds. And stay put until you get the all clear. - I hope we all die. (ominous music) - Firing thrusters on my mark. Mark. (ship rumbling) (thrusters fizzling) (dramatic music) (ship rumbling) (ship thudding) (somber music) (airlock hissing) (ominous music) - Oh my God it's cold in here. - Yeah. - Looks like it still has power though. - Hey, have a look at this. (eerie music) - [Mother] Oh my God, he's still alive. (computer chiming) (foreboding music) - [Female Computer Voice] Warning, life support failure. - Hey, what's happening? - Looks like the system just crashed. We must've tripped something opening the hatch. - [Commander] My God, this guy's in cryogenic freeze. If he comes out cold turkey, he may not survive. - Okay, let's get him to the infirmary. - Can we handle that? - I think we'll manage. (airlock hissing) (computer beeping) (ominous music) (computer beeping) - So, how is our patient? - Well, he should be coming out of it in the next few hours. You know, I can't tell how long he's been under but his vital signs are good. No trauma, no signs of contagion. The guy's clean. - Good. If you've got a moment, there's something I'd like you to see on the fighter. - What? - Well, it's kinda weird. Come. - [Mother] What is it? - The whole fighter is weird. It's so outdated it should be in a museum. (computer beeping) (door whooshing) - I don't believe this. (ominous music) (eerie piano music) Oh, what happened to you? (eerie music) (Ronnie chuckling) That figures. (Ronnie gasping) - Where am I? Where am I? - You're on a spaceship. - Spaceship? Civilian spaceship? - Yeah. Actually, it's a deep space observatory. Can I have my arm back, please? (somber music) - I'm thirsty. Is there anyplace on this tub were a guy can get a drink? - Yeah. Hang on. (foreboding music) (water trickling) (Carter groaning) - You're a little young to be a doctor, aren't you? - I'm not a doctor. - [Carter] What are you then? If you don't mind my asking. - Well, I guess I'm the ship's cat. (Carter chuckling) (Carter coughing) Why is that so funny? I mean, that's how they treat me. - Who? - My mom and the commander. Like, they're scientists, right? So, I guess that's normal. - Scientists, huh? Where are they now? - I don't know. Oh, I think they went to go look at your fighter thing. (eerie music) - Watch this step. - And the rest of the crew? - It's just us. - Just you? (ominous music) (Carter groaning) - Now. (computer beeping) Have a look at this. (computer chiming) - [Woman] He's been out here 15 years? - [Commander] That's right. (Carter groaning) - Are you okay? - Oh yeah, I'm all right. It's just... It's just a little... freezer burn, you know? Hey, hey, hey, what's your name? - Veronica. But everybody calls me Ronnie because it's easier. - Ronnie. I like that. - So I've told you mine, you tell me yours. - Nash. - Nash. Nash. Well, I'm pleased to meet you, Nash. - Yeah. - What base is he from? - I can't tell. It's encrypted. - So how old are you, Ronnie? - I'm 18. - No. I would guess that you were at least 22. - Today is actually my birthday. - Really? - Yeah. - Well happy birthday, Ronnie. - Thanks. - I hope you get everything you wish for. - Well that's pretty standard military procedure to encrypt the flight recorder data. Our ship's computer should have no problem decoding it. - Ronnie, you wanna hand me my clothes? There's a little bit of a draft, if you know what I mean. - Are you sure you're okay to get up? - I think so. (Carter groaning) Thanks. - So, are you a soldier? - What makes you say that? - My mom used to be in the military once and she had clothes like that. - Was she now? - Mm-hmm. - Well, Ronnie, it's a long story and I won't bore you with it. You wanna hand me my shirt? - I've got time. - Maybe later. Now, does this place have any long range communications equipment? - Sure. Why? - Maybe when he comes to he can tells us. - You know, I'm gonna contact Terra Nova, let them know what we have. Maybe they can tell us something. - Good idea. - Okay. - This guy should not be out here. (door whooshing) (computer chiming) - So this is it. - That looks about right. Now, let's see here. Oh. Ronnie, I'm gonna have to ask you to turn around. These military codes, they're classified. - Okay. (computer chiming) (ominous music) So, are you a spy? (Carter chuckling) - Something like that. (computer chiming) Okay. That oughta do it. - That was fast. - Hey, you just gotta know what to do. Now, Ronnie, like I said, this is classified. So let's just keep this between you and me, okay? - Okay. (door whooshing) - If we start the recalibration, we could... - Mom, Cal, this is Nash. - It's nice to meet you. - Well, welcome aboard, Nash. - [Carter] I suppose I owe you people my thanks. - Well, it's lucky we came along when we did. (Carter chuckling) - So, we didn't expect to see you up so soon. How are you feeling? - Oh, everything seems to be working okay. - Really? Good, good. You had quite the adventure. Do you know how long you've been in cold sleep? (ominous music) - I think you better sit down. (atmosphere humming) - 15 years. I don't believe it. - Another 15 minutes and you were headed straight into the sun, young man. (Carter chuckling) - I guess it's kind of a miracle that you people were here for me and all. (door whooshing) - [Mother] So tell us what happened. - Truth is, I'm not really sure. I mean... I was just a mole, a grunt. Thank you, Ronnie. - Anytime. (ominous beat music) - I was a stoker on a deep space cruiser. We were on a recon mission. Well, one minute I was just minding my own business, doing my job and the next minute... (gunshots booming) everybody started screaming. (gunshots booming) Guys were yelling. (prisoners shouting) They're running everywhere. (gunshots popping) Guys start shooting at me. I mean me, why? I don't know. (gunshots booming) (ominous music) Then the bombs went off. That was fun. (explosion rumbling) (men yelling) The alarm sounded. Lights were flashing. And just to make things really interesting, some asshole decided to vape the goddamn ship. (explosions rumbling) (ominous music) I barely got out in time. (ship whooshing) (explosion booming) Anyway, after about a week I didn't know how long I was gonna be out there so I decided to use the stasis tube. (ominous music) - Well it sounds like a mutiny to me. What exactly was your mission? - Oh. (Carter chuckling) Sorry, chief, that's classified. I mean, Ronnie said you used to be in the military, so I'm sure you can appreciate that kind of thing. God... 15 years. - [Mother] Do you have any family? - Oh. Not that I know of. - Well that's probably a good thing considering the circumstances. - Yeah, I suppose so. Well, anyway, that's my story. What's yours? Ronnie, here, says you've been studying that red giant out there, that seems like a lot of work. You been here awhile? - Yeah, we've been here awhile. We've been here a year and a half now. - A year and a half? - [Cal] Mm-hmm. - [Carter] Pretty girl like you cooped up in a place like this for a year and a half, that's not healthy. I assumed you at least baked her a birthday cake. - Oh my God. Oh, Ronnie, I am so sorry. - Ronnie, I'm sorry, it was my fault. Your mother and I, we've just been so busy. Completely forgot. We'll make it up to you, I promise. (Ronnie chuckling) - I don't need you to make anything up to me, Commander. It's not like you're my father. Just because you two-- - Ronnie. - So, yeah. - You know, it's none of my business but if it were me, I'd make it up to here right now. - Of course. - [Carter] Hey, chief, is that thing programed to make alcohol? I mean, the real stuff, the hangovers and everything? Not that synthetic crap. - Yes, it is. - Can we? (pleasant piano music) - [Cal] Yeah, sure, of course Ronnie, it's your birthday. (Ronnie laughing) - [Ronnie] Thank you! - Oh, hey, hey, hey, take it easy. I've been frozen for 15 years. I'm still a little fragile. - I could use a drink myself. (atmosphere buzzing) ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Happy birthday dear Ronnie ♪ Happy birthday ♪ To you (mother chuckling) - [Mother] Happy birthday, sweetheart. - [Carter] Congratulations, Ronnie. - [Cal] Go on, Ronnie, make a wish. (ominous music) (Cal laughing) (mother clapping) - Woo! All right, all right, I'd like to make a toast. To... Cal, Billie, my new friends. Especially to you, Veronica, Ronnie, on your 18th birthday. May you have many more. Here's to being in the right place at the right time. What do you think there, birthday girl? - Mmmmm. Tastes kind of sour. (Carter chuckling) - You'll get used to it. - Hey, before I forget. I found something on the ship. (ominous music) I think it belongs to you. Looks like it has some sentimental value. - Yeah, yeah, this... - Unfortunately, we're waiting for the priest. - Ah. Jeez, I thought I'd lost this for sure. - I hope the devil has a special place for you. (gunshots booming) (warden groaning) And for all your men. (gunshot booming) - It was given to me by-- - [Warden Voiceover] You're a disgrace to the uniform. - By someone who got very close to me. - [Warden Voiceover] An insult to humanity. An abomination in the eyes of God. (gunshots booming) (woman screaming) (man screaming) - For someone who's been asleep for 15 years, I'm suddenly awfully tired. - Oh, well, we have a room made up for you up on deck five. I'll take you up. - No, I'll do it. - Uh. - Uh, uh... Goodnight. - Goodnight. Get some rest. - Well, she is 18. - I didn't say a word. (somber music) (Ronnie giggling) - So... (Ronnie laughing) What is your name anyway? - You know my name, Ronnie. - Not your other name. - Now why would you wanna know that? (ominous music) - Because I'm thinking about kissing you and... I wanna be able to whisper sweet nothing's in your ear. - Well, in that case... It's Lee. - Lee. - Mm-hmm. Lee Nash. - Lee Nash? I've never kissed a man before, Lee Nash. - Never? - Nope. - Happy birthday, Ronnie. (pleasant music) (Ronnie giggling) (machinery humming) (computer beeping) - Well the recalibration started. You know, I wanted to contact Terra Nova but long range is down completely now. - The ship's falling apart. I'll fix it in the morning. - [Billie] Any sign of Ronnie? - She's gonna have a hell of a head. - You know, maybe that's my fault. - [Cal] What do you mean? - Well, I took this assignment right after David died because... I just thought it would be good for Ronnie and I to be together, away from everything. But I certainly didn't count on... - [Cal] What? - Us. (somber piano music) - I think she blames me. I'm trying to take the place of her father or something. - Something like that, yes. - Well then, you know, maybe this guy will be a good distraction for her. - Well, he certainly has an interesting story to tell. - That's for sure. - But I also think that we can cut him a little slack. (Cal chuckling) - He's been on ice for 15 years. - And Veronica is certainly crazy about him. - [Cal] She'll be fine. - Well, I don't know what to do. I mean, she already thinks that we're keeping her prisoner, so I... But... Maybe I should have a little chat with her. (somber piano music) - Maybe that's a good idea. I'll have a word with Nash and set up some ground rules as far as Ronnie's concerned. - You're so good to us, Cal, and I appreciate that. - I love you, Billie. I'll do whatever it takes to make us work as a family. - Yeah. (pleasant music) (atmosphere rumbling) (alarm chiming) - Oh my God. This is it. (atmosphere buzzing) - It's starting to collapse and fast. - Yeah. And we are too close. - All right. (electronic chiming) Veronica? Nash? Hang on, we're coming around. - Preparing to maneuver. (rockets fizzling) (ship rumbling) (metal creaking) (dramatic music) (atmosphere buzzing) (rockets fizzling) (ominous music) (Ronnie giggling) - Okay, well, this is it. - All this danger's making me horny. (machinery humming) (door clattering) - [Billie] Veronica? - Oh, I hear my mom. - Veronica? - I hear my mom. (footsteps thumping) So there you go. It's got a bed and stuff, so... - Everything okay? - Yeah. - Good. Can I have a word with you, Ronnie? - Sure. I'll see you later, Mr. Nash. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Night. (foreboding music) (somber music) (computer chiming) - 15 year old code should be no problem for this baby. - So this is about me getting drunk, isn't it? (Billie chuckling) - No, my dear, that's another conversation entirely. (Billie sighing) I wanna talk to you about our guest. - What about him? - I just want you to be really careful. - Careful? - Yes because we don't know anything about him and I don't want you getting so fond of him. You know, just in case. - In case what? You know, you're always trying to tell me what's right for me. Like, what right do you have getting all high and mighty? You're the one who's got the hots for our dear commander. - [Billie] Veronica. - You're the one who's spitting on Dad's grave. - You wait a second-- - No, you wait a second! I've been living like a hermit for nearly two years here and someone's come along who I can talk to and he's interesting and you're getting threatened by it? That's too bad. (somber music) - You know, Veronica, I really shouldn't have to spell this out for you. This guy is a big question mark and I don't want any adolescent fantasies getting the better of your judgment. - Adolescent. Adolescent? - [Billie] Yes. - Get out! Just get out, I hate you! - [Billie] You get some sleep. (Ronnie yelling) (door whooshing) (dramatic music) (ominous military music) - [Woman Voiceover] It is the finding of this court-martial that you be stripped of your rank as Officer and discharged from the service forthwith. Your lack of judgment has resulted in this disaster and the subsequent deaths of 12 of your fellow officers. Take her down. (ominous military music) (dramatic music) (Nash huffing) (door knocking) (door whooshing) - Hi. - Hi. (Ronnie chuckling) (somber music) I just dropped by to make sure you had everything you needed. - Huh? Oh, well, I got everything I need now. Mmmmmm. (Ronnie chuckling) - Not so fast. - Don't worry, baby, I know what I'm doing. (ominous music) (Ronnie chuckling) - That hurts. - I know. You'll get used to it. (menacing music) (suspenseful music) - Stop! No, stop! Stop! - Ronnie? (punch thudding) (Ronnie yelping) (punches thudding) (Cal groaning) (suspenseful music) Ronnie? (Nash groaning) (glass shattering) (Nash yelling) (ominous music) Ronnie? Ronnie, are you okay? You okay, Ronnie? (hit thudding) (sinister music) (pipe thudding) (metal clanking) (foreboding music) ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Happy birthday dear Ronnie - Here's to being in the right place at the right time. Given to me by someone who got very close to me. - You know, you're always trying to tell me what's right for me. Like, what right do you have getting all high and mighty? You're the one who's got the hots for our dear commander. - Cal? - [Ronnie] You're the one spitting on Dad's grave. - [Billie] Wait a second. - No, you wait a second!

(ominous music) (atmosphere humming) (electronic beeping) (door whooshing) (footsteps thumping) (sinister music) - Cal? - Not quite. You know, I'm not too big on rank. I guess you could say I've got a problem with authority. I'm not gonna have a problem with you though, am I? (Billie groaning) Oh. I'll take that as a yes. (slap smacking) (sinister music) (Billie moaning) Come on! (Billie groaning) (ominous music) (Ronnie gasping) - Oh. (metal clanking) Oh my God. Oh, Cal. - He's still breathing.

Barely broke a sweat. Happy trails, commander. (airlock hissing) - No! Don't, please. Please, he doesn't have a chance. If the radiation doesn't kill him, the supernova will. - I'm afraid there's only enough room for on alpha male aboard this tub. You just be glad you're not going along for the ride. - I would rather we die out there with him than stay with you. - Unfortunately, I've got big plans for the two of you. (airlock hissing) (Billie gasping) (alarm beeping) - Look, I know you don't care but let him live and I'll cooperate. I can give you everything you want. - I got everything I want right here. - Get off! (ominous music) - You wanna play with me? - No. - You wanna play? Oh, I think you do. Come on, let's play! (alarm honking) - No, Cal! (ship rumbling) (dramatic music) (ship whooshing) (Ronnie whimpering) (foreboding music) I'm gonna kill you. - No! (gun clicking) No! - You make no mistake, Mom. Who lives and dies aboard this ship is determined by one person. You screw with me again and I will carve your little darling daughter here up for supper! (ominous music) You got that? Hmmm? - Yeah. - Good. Now you take this last tub to the infirmary. - Mom. - [Nash] And maybe I'll let you get some sleep. - Oh. - What a day.

Looks like you and me have a lot in common. - What did you do to my daughter? - What do you think I did? Oh yeah. Yeah, she's a real thoroughbred. Suppose she takes after her mother, huh? Of course, the only way I'm gonna find that out for sure is to go for a ride myself. Hell, between the two of you I could set up my own breading farm right here on the station. - Don't you touch her. - Save your strength, Mom, you're gonna need it. Hey! Wake up. Morning, sunshine. - Mom? - I'm right here, Veronica, it's okay. - Oh, it sure is. In fact, your mother and I were just talking and I've decided to give you a second chance. What do you say? Didn't you enjoy our tender moment in love together? - [Billie] Get your hands off her. - Ladies, now we are going to be living together for a very long time, so I suggest you find ways to make me happy. Because if I'm happy, you're happy. Now, Veronica, I thought we had something, I really did. (Veronica sighing) - We do. I enjoyed what we did. - What we did together? There's so much more where that came from. You could just let me show you. We just scratched the surface. - I'd like that. (ominous music) - Yeah? - [Ronnie] Yeah. - Come here. (kick thudding) Let's see how far you'll really go. (suspenseful music) (Ronnie whimpering) (gun clattering) (Ronnie crying) - No! (Ronnie yelling) No!

I don't want him to die. - I know that, sweetheart. I do. 63 minutes till critical mass. - That's not much time. I really messed up. - Oh, Veronica. Oh, don't ever think that. This was all my fault. This whole thing was my fault. And I'm so sorry he hurt you. - Mom, I'm gonna be okay, really, I'm not a child anymore. I've grown up. - Yes, my darling, you have. (somber music) Okay. This plot will take us back to our original orbit. Now, there's something I need you to do for me. There may be a variance in propulsion that drives us off course and you're gonna need to correct it. - You want me to drive this thing? - You can do it. You just keep the cursor at the bottom of that V. When this light goes on, you press that key. - Okay, what does it do? - Kicks the computer in the pants and don't forget to hold on. - Where are you going? - I'm going sub level. (door whooshing) And Veronica, secure the door behind me. - Okay. (door thudding) (dramatic music) (sinister music) - Gentlemen, I know this is short notice but we're gonna have to dispense with the pleasantries. We got a situation here. - Just where exactly is here? - It's a deep space observatory. - And what kind of situation? - Well, the ship is under my control but its developed a bit of a problem. See, I've got a couple of women running around playing hard to get. I need you guys to take care of it. (Russell laughing) - [Prisoner] Carter's got some women problems! Carter's the man! - Hey, we listened to you before and look where it got us. - Hey, give it a rest. You're alive, aren't you? - Yeah, by the grace of God! I say we vote on who gives the orders around here. No offense, Carter, but you're a damn psychopath. (ominous music) (gunshot booming) (man groaning) - None taken. Anybody else wanna vote? - No, boss. We're with you. - [Prisoner] Yeah, we're with you, man. - Yeah, Carter. - All the way. - Good. All right. Gentlemen, help yourselves. Everybody makes sure you got one of these. Daddy wants to keep tabs on you at all times. We must start a the bottom, work our way up. - What do we do if we find them? - You can do whatever you want. Just make sure you call he rest of us before you kill 'em. Move out. (ominous music) (eerie music) (foreboding music) - You check in there. - Got it. (eerie music) (metal creaking) (ominous music) Carter. - Hands up, soldier. - Yeah, did you get her? - I said, hands up! - You wouldn't want to shoot a man of the cloth now, would you? - I wouldn't want to. (gunshot booming) (sinister music) But I will. - All right, everyone listen up. Stay down there, she's probably still close. (suspenseful beat music) (gunshots booming) (bullets clinking) (suspenseful music) (rapid gunfire popping) - [Thug] We found her! (Billie groaning) - It's about time. - She's headed your way! (suspenseful music) It's empty. We lost her. - No we didn't. (metal clanking) (ominous music) Go after her. - Why me? (gun cranking) When I'm done, you and me are gonna have a word, Carter. - Fine, you can tell me your whole life story. Just make sure she's dead and you can wipe that shit-eating grin off your face and get your ass over to the coolant room. If Lars, here, screw up, that' where she's gonna come out. - [Thug] Okay, boss.

(Ronnie crying) (suspenseful music) - [Female Computer Voice] Accessing disc, drive A. (faint audio recording speaking) - [Warden Recording] Official database 10 light years... A hundred billion witnesses to watch you die. An entire deep space colony massacred by you and your men! Men, women and children butchered. Families, Carter! Families you were sent there to protect! You say, for what? For God sake, man, what happened to you? - I got bored. - [Warden] I hope the devil has a special place for you and for all your men. - Oh my God. - [Female Computer Voice] Refueling complete.

I see you know all about crossfires, so why don't you just put down the gun and come out of there? - You first, shithead. - Shithead, I like that. Of course, I would've preferred pooky or buttercup. (gunshots booming) Damn it, Jansen! (gunshots booming) Sorry about that, Mom. Now look, I'm offering Ronnie and you a second chance here. So, why don't you just throw out your weapon? Come on, Ma, you don't wanna make a decision you're gonna regret later. - Bad decisions are all in my past. - This is your only course of action left, Billie! - Yeah? You're forgetting something, Nash. I've turned this ship around. You don't surrender soon, it's over for all of us. - Well, you know what I always say? It ain't over till the fat lady sings. (ominous music) (gunshots booming) (gun clicking) God! (metal clanking) (explosions booming) (Carter coughing) (ominous music) - Hey, buttercup. How'd you like that song? (rapid gunfire popping) (alarm beeping) (metal squeaking) (sinister music) (air whooshing) (Carter thudding) (Billie sighing) - May you rot in hell.

(Ronnie giggling) (computer beeping) - All right. Hold on. (computer chiming) (engine rumbling) (metal creaking) There he is. (alarm beeping) The automatic homing circuits must've kicked in. Good thing our friend Nash was 15 years behind the times. Okay. We intercept Cal in eight minutes. - How long before the star goes nova? - In about 10. - Mom. That's not much time. (ominous music) - Yeah, let's get undocked. (dramatic music) (somber music) - Mom, I love you. - [Billie] I love you too. - Boo! (Ronnie screaming) - [Billie] Go! Go! - Oh, what? No group hug? (suspenseful music) (Billie and Ronnie whimpering) Hold it! I should've killed you two right off the top. This is what I get for being a gentleman. Time to die. - This is between you and me. You let her go. - Oh, Mom, you're breaking my heart. (gunshot booming) - No! (Ronnie yelling) Mama! (ominous music) Mom! No. Mom. - Run. - No. - Go. - No! No!

Brings back memories, don't it? Oh. (sinister music) What's this? (computer beeping) - [Ronnie Recording] July 1st, a miracle has happened. He was totally naked when I first saw him lying there unconscious in the infirmary and I've never seen a naked man before. Well, except in gym. He gave me the tingles. I wanted to make love to him right there. (sinister music) - Oh, that's sweet, it really is, Ronnie. Unfortunately, the expiry date on my interest for you is gone and passed. (footsteps thumping) Now this can be quick or this can be slow. It's your choice. (eerie music) You know, I really thought you were a big girl, Veronica. But I see you hiding there under your bed like some kind of scared child, frightened of monsters, and I really have to wonder. (ominous music) - I'm not a child. (Ronnie spitting) - That was a mistake. - You're the mistake! - Get ready for a whole world of pain, you little-- - Carter! - Cal! Thank God, you made it! - That's right. Now I'm gonna teach you a lesson. (Carter groaning) That's for Ronnie. That's for Billie! (Carter groaning) And this is for me! (pipe thudding) (Carter grunting) (suspenseful music) - Just take it easy there, chief, because you don't wanna kill the groom before the wedding. - Well guess what, the wedding's off! (pipe thudding) (Carter groaning) - [Ronnie] Cal! - Oh, my darling. How are you? - I'm okay. - Where's your mother? - [Ronnie] She was shot. (Billie whimpering) - She was what? - She's shot. (Billie whimpering) Mom? - Cal. - Mom? - [Cal] We've gotta go. - What about him? - That's a good idea. No, chief, why don't you-- - Leave him. - Just give me a hand here. No hard feelings, huh? No, wait. Don't leave me here! (dramatic music) You're never gonna make it! (atmosphere rumbling) (energy whooshing) (suspenseful music) (explosion rumbling) (suspenseful music) (atmosphere buzzing) - That's it. (Billie groaning) Strap her in. (suspenseful music) (atmosphere buzzing) (explosions booming) You all right? - Yeah. (explosions rumbling) - [Female Computer Voice] Disengaging docking ramp. - Hold on.

The red giant is dead and so is he girl I was just yesterday. A pulsar now beats like a newborn heart where the star once burned. As my stepfather says, out of death, new life always springs. I'm not sure whether it'll be better or worse than the old but it'll be different and there's no going back. (dramatic music) - Dad? - Yeah? - Thanks. - [Cal] That's all right, Ronnie. (pleasant music) (ship whooshing) (suspenseful beat music) (dramatic music) (foreboding music) (dramatic music) (foreboding music) (intense beat music)
