- I understand you're a friend of Harry March. - [Man] Who's Harry March? - Best safe cracker around, maybe the best in the business. - [Man] Never heard of him. - Okay, just thought you might be interested in a deal. - [Man] Wait a minute, kid, what kind of a deal? - What difference does it make? You said you didn't know him. - [Man] I make friends real easy. What kind of a deal? - A big deal, a million dollars cash. (dramatic gripping music) - And at this point Hamlet picks up the skull of Yorick and delivers the famous speech. Now to whom was this speech delivered? Vince, would you mind answering the question, please? Vince! - I'm sorry, Mr. Carter, would you repeat the question, please? - To whom was Hamlet's famous graveside speech delivered? - I don't know, man, I didn't catch the name and address on the envelope. (students laugh) - That's very amusing, Vince. I don't think that you'll find a failing mark in this course quite as jocular. Marvin, would you answer the question, please? - Yes, sir, the speech is from act five, scene one, delivered to Horatio and the grave digger. - Very good, if some of the others of you would emulate Marvin, concentrate your efforts toward learning something, you might all be a lot better off. Well, I guess that should be enough for today. I just wanna remind you that your term papers are due on Wednesday, and for several of you who are on the borderline, you might profit by putting a little extra time and energy into this paper. (bell rings) (students chatter) Oh, Marvin, can I see you a second? - [Marv] Yes, sir. - Have you given any more thought to college? The term's gonna be over in a week, you know. - Well, I still haven't made up my mind what I'm gonna do, sir. - Oh, Marv, you have so much to offer. It's a shame if you don't take advantage of it. - I know, sir, I'd like to go to college, but well, it costs money, you know. - Yes, I know, and I'm still working on that scholarship for you. I think maybe we'll be able to figure something out. - I sure hope so. Thank you Mr. Carter. - Hey, fink, what's the idea of trying to make a fool outta me in there? - I don't understand what you mean, Vince. - Okay, now you know what I mean, answering that question like you were some kind of a king or something. - Okay, Vince. - Look, anytime you think you're better than me, we-- - Vince, get your big paws off of him. - Hey, when did you start playing nursemaid to this creep? - Ever since you started trying to be Tarzan or somebody. - It's all right, Betty. - No, it's not. Now get outta here, leave him alone you animal. - Oh, okay, baby, if you wanna play mother, I'm not gonna stand in your way. Am I gonna see you tonight? - No, I have other plans. - Okay, baby, you change your mind, just give me a call. (slow reserved music) - You didn't have to do that, Betty. Maybe you'll get him mad or something. - What do I care? The world's full of guys like him. You're kinda special. Look, I'm serious. I've kinda wanted to say this to you for a long time. - Betty, you go with Vince, he's sort of the star of the whole school. - Boys like Vince will never amount to anything. - Betty, will you go out with me? - I practically asked you out, haven't I? - Well, gee, I mean-- - Well, how 'bout tonight? - I thought you said you were busy tonight. - I'm busy for him. - Well, sure. - Fine, pick me up at eight. - Okay, I'll pick you up at eight. - I'll see you then. - Yeah, Betty, what about Vince? - [Betty] Don't worry about Vince, I can take care of him. - [Mr. Grant] Hey, Marv, is that you? - [Marv] Yeah, Pop, it's me. - Everything go okay today? - Uh huh. Hey, how come you're gettin' all dressed up? - I got a date tonight. Real sharp girl I met down at Tony's. - Well, I've got a date tonight, too. - You do? - [Marv] Mm hmm. - Well, who with? - Betty Alexander. - Betty Ale, hey, hey, she's the best looking chick in the whole school, aint she? - She sure is. - Well, what in the world is she going out with you for? - That's okay, Pop, I know I'm no much, but she likes me. - Gee, kid, you're fine, fine, just a chip off the old block after all, huh? - Yeah, I guess so. - Hey, Marv, I was wondering, you got any money on ya? - Well, a couple of dollars, Pop, but-- - Look kid, it's a real fancy girl, you know what I mean? Well, I'm gonna have to take her out to supper probably, and well, know. - I know, Pop, but I got a date tonight myself. I don't get paid until the 15th. - How much you got? - Well, $6 and some change. - Tell you what, we'll split even, okay? - Okay, Pop. - Thanks, boy. Oh, by the way, I think I'm gonna have a job next week. - Really? - Yep, I met a guy today who's sure he can put me on full time. - Be swell, Pop. - Hey, don't worry, boy, I'll hang on to this one. No more booze for me, I promise. Pretty soon we'll have money enough to get outta this dump. You can quit that crumby job of yours and go to college like you want, like your mother wanted you to. - I know, Pop. - Thanks, kid. Have a good time tonight, huh. - You too, Pop. I'm sorry, Betty, honest. - Oh, that's okay, at least it was a good movie. - It's just that I, well, I had to give some money to Pop and-- - Oh, just forget it, I'm having a lovely time. - Betty, I've got almost a dollar left, would you like to have a Coke? (upbeat lively music) - Well, this guy grabs the chick by the neck, see, and he gives her a couple of whacks right across the plate. Man, he liked to knock her head off. Hey, daddy, you don't dig my act or something? - What's the matter, Vinny, that chick Betty bugging you? - Nah, she don't bug me none. - Yeah, why should she? We got so much stuff around here we have to beat it off with a club. - Yeah, so where's it all here? Hey, am I seeing right? - Oh, man, I don't believe it, I must be cracking up. - What is she doing with that fink? - Well, I thought the zoo closed at six o'clock. - Yeah, so how come you got one of the animals out for a walk? - Very funny. - Look, Betty, I think we oughta go on home. I got some homework to do. - You aren't gonna let these big apes scare us away, are you? - No, it's not that, it's that I've got some homework to do. - Okay, come on. Well, goodnight, boys. Better stay off the streets before the dog catcher sees you without your licenses. - Boy, she sure got salty in a big hurry. - Where does that cheap broad come off talking to us like that? - Hey, Vinny, let's follow and give him a going over, huh? - Yeah, like the guy in the story that Burt was telling. - [Vince] No, you guys stay here. - Hey, I thought you said that chick didn't move you? - She don't, not at all. (slow gentle music) - Thanks, Marv, I had a real good time. - Well, it would have been better if I had more money. - Next time, maybe. - You mean there's gonna be a next time? - Well, if you want it. - If I want it? Of course, I do. - I was just afraid, well, I'm not real smart of anything. I, I thought I might be kinda dull. - Oh, no, you're not dull. - Thanks. Marv, I hate to ask you for a favor or anything but-- - Go ahead, anything you want. - Well, it's Mr. Carter's Shakespeare class. You know, I'm kinda on the borderline. If I don't pass this class, I'm not gonna graduate. And my old man'll kill me for sure. - Well, if you write a good term paper, you'll pass. - That's just it. You know, I don't understand him, Shakespeare, I mean. He's, he's so deep. I don't know what to do. - You want me to write a paper for you? - Oh, no, I just thought maybe you'd help me a little bit. - I don't mind, it'll only take me a couple of hours. - Would you, I mean would you really? Thanks, Marv, I'll never forget it. Well, goodnight, I'll see you tomorrow. - Goodnight, Betty. (startling tense music) - Oh, Vince, you scared me to death. - Look, what's with you two? - With me and Marv? Oh, you can't be serious? - Look, you were with him. You went out with him instead of me. - Oh, but honey, I just wanted him to write my term paper for me. - You sure that's all? - Well, of course, silly, you don't think I could possibly see anything in him, do you? - Nah, I didn't think so. - Well, you see, actually, it's kind of of us. If I don't pass the course, I won't graduate, my parents won't let us get married or anything. - Yeah, but why'd you kiss him? - Kiss him, you call that a kiss? Now this is what I call a kiss. (slow jazz music) - Betty. Have you ever thought about marrying anybody. - Sure, I wanted to marry Rock Hudson once, but he was taken at the time, so then I decided I'd marry Gary Cooper. And I found out he had a daughter older than me so (laughs). - I'm serious, Betty. You know what I'm gettin' at. - After all, Marv, you have to go to college and everything. - I won't go to college. I'll get a full time job. I bet Mr. Matthews will put me on for $75 a week. - 75? I guess I misled you just a little. I mean you're sweet and smart. I think someday you'll really be somebody important. Little Betty isn't ready to settle down, and try and live on $75 a week. Look, I've been poor too long for that. Oh, look, I better be going. My old man will be full of questions. He thinks I'm a tramp. What's the matter? - What's the matter? You said your father thinks you're a tramp? - Just when he's feeling good. If you could hear some of the things he, one night when my mom was out, he. Someday I'm gonna show him. I'm gonna come back here with my diamonds and my furs, and I'm gonna throw it right in his stinkin' face. - [Mr. Martin] Marv? - [Marv] Hmm? - How come you aint out with Betty tonight? - You know, she wanted to stay home tonight, said it makes her old man happy if she stays in every once in a while. - Oh, I see. Look, Marv. - [Marv] Mm hmm. - What would you say if I got married again? - Well, what brought that on, Pop? - Well, I figure you'll be through school soon, probably be going to college, or gettin' married maybe. A man's gotta have someone to look after him in his old age. I got that job coming up. - She the girl you met down at Tony's place? You love her? - Oh, she's wonderful, kid, sweet as pie, you know what I mean? - (chuckles) Who you tryin' to convince, me or you? - No, really, she's different. - Pop, if you got married, you'd have to hold a job. - I would, boy. I'd do anything in the world for her. - Well, I guess you love her then. - Would you mind? - No, I think it's great. When's the big day. - That isn't settled. - Pop, have you asked her yet? - Fact is I haven't, but that won't be no problem, boy. I can tell. - Well, I'm real happy for you, Pop. You know, I guess there's nothing in the whole world as nice as being in love. (horn blares) - Hiya kid. - Hi, Mr. Mathews. - We've got another deal going. - How much is involved. - A million dollars, cash. (slow suspenseful music) (knocking on door) Yeah? - 'Scuse me, Mr. Mathews, you wanna sign these papers? - Later, kid, I'm real busy. - [Marv] Okay. - We've handled some big deals before, Walt, but never a million dollars. - [Man In White Jacket] 'Scuse me, buddy. - [Walt] We've never brought in this much heroin before. - [Bill] What's our cut? - [Walt] 25%. - [Bill] Good enough. - [Walt] The boat's due in Saturday night. Money will arrive here sometime Saturday afternoon. - [Bill] Who's bringing it in? - Nevermind, it's coming, you can rest assured. Now, I'll put it in the safe, and at exactly 11:15 I'll be back with the guy carrying the dope. I'll give him the money and we'll make the exchange. - Isn't a little risky leaving a million dollars in the safe that long? - Nobody'll know it's there. And I'd rather have it here than carry it around, if you follow me. - Sure. - Now all you have to do is open the doors for us at 11:15, and then stand by to make sure there's no double cross. - Okay. - Well, that's it, guess all we have to do now is wait. (tense dramatic music) I'll see you, Bill. - [Bill] Take it easy. - Hey, kid, kid! - [Marv] Yes, sir. - Let me have a look at those papers. (slow reserved music) - I'm very disappointed in you, Marv. - Mr. Carter? - I think you do. Well, we might as well get this over with as quickly as possible. He wrote your paper, didn't he? - He, of course not, I wrote it myself. - Oh, come now, Betty. You have many attributes, I will confess, but a comprehensive understanding of Shakespeare and his works is not one of them. - I studied, I worked real hard. - Well, Marv, you wanna tell me the truth? - She wrote it, honest, Mr. Carter. - (sighs) All right, Betty, what is it all about? - Well, it's about Shakespeare and his plays. - You didn't even read it, did you? - Of course I read it, I wrote it. - Now look, neither one of you is fooling anybody but yourselves. Now come on Marvin, admit it and get it over with. Come on! - Yes, sir. - That's better. - You didn't have to tell him. He couldn't prove it. - I hope you understand that I'll have to fail you for this, Betty. As far as you're concerned, Marv, you're grades are too good. I can't possibly fail you. I can't even blame you when you come right down to it, but I am going to withdraw my recommendation for the scholarship. I thought that you were different, Marv, but I guess I was wrong. You don't deserve that scholarship and you know it. - You're just bitter because you can't do anything better than 60 bucks a week with your fancy words and big brain. You have no right to flunk me. - That's all you're worried about. You don't even care that Marv may lose his opportunity to go to college because of you. All right, that's all you're both excused. - Betty! Betty! - Look, stay away from me you fink! - Betty. - Look, you didn't have to tell him. - But he knew. - He didn't know, he couldn't prove it. - Betty, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. - Well, be sorry somewhere else and just leave me alone. - You mean it's over just because of this? - Over, now what's there to be over? - Well, I thought you said that-- - Look, I didn't say anything. You did all the talking, remember? - Oh, wow, you were just using me. - That's right. Look, all I know is now I'm, my father's gonna kill me, he really will. And I'm not gonna graduate, and I guess things just don't wanna work out for me. - Betty. (slow stirring music) Betty, you said that you wanted to come back and throw diamonds and minks in his face. - So? - So if I could get those things for you, well, would it make a difference in the way you feel, I mean about the whole world? - Thanks, Marv, but it won't help. - I mean it, Betty, could it make a difference? - Well, bring 'em around first chance you get, might make a difference with dad. - [Walt] I'll put it in the safe. - [Bill] Isn't it a little risky leaving a million dollars in the safe that long? (slow dreary music) (Marv sobs) - Why, Pop, you said you were through. - You gonna lecture me again? - No, I'm not gonna lecture you again. - Good. - What happened, Pop? - She turned me down. I aint good enough for her, aint got enough dough. They're all alike, only thing they want is money. (dramatic uneasy music) - [Walt] Nobody'll know it's there. Nobody'll know it's there. Nobody'll know it's there. - Pop, I'll be right back. - Where you goin'? You going to see that girl again? - No, I'm not going to see that girl again. - She's just like all the rest, you'll see. - Lay down, Pop, I'll be right back. - Marv, don't go, you're my son. You're all I got left in the world. - Come on, Pop, and I'll help you on the sofa. I'll be right back, Pop. When I get back, maybe we can show 'em all a thing or two. (slow sultry music) - Boy, if the guys could see me now. - They'd just be jealous, that's all. - I don't know, it, well you know, I'm supposed to be hard and tough and all. - Tell me you love me. - I love you. - Again. - I love you, baby. I love you. - When are you gonna prove it? - Prove it? You mean you don't believe me? - Oh, I believe it. But a girl likes to see something real, you know. - Oh, you mean like a car or jewels or something? - Oh, or something. - You'll have it all someday, baby. I swear it, you'll have it all. - When? - Soon, when I get outta school and have a chance to look around a little. - Now what if someone comes along who already has it? - I'd kill him and take it away. - Tell me again. - I love you, baby. (mid-tempo frantic music) (slow lighthearted music) - Get your mitts outta my register. - Samuel, please, my most valuable possessions. - Sure, for stealing my cigars, drinking my wine, and dipping into my cash register. - Samuel, I'm shocked, you're own flesh and blood. - My what? Just because I'm married to your sister doesn't give you pose to come in and nail my inventory. - Well, she's your wife, isn't she? - Yeah, but-- - And she's my sister. - Sure. - Then you admit it, what's yours is mine. - Look, I don't wanna be a nag. Why don't you go get a job? - A job? Would you have a doctor take up a pick? A chemist sit behind the wheel of a truck? - If he was making a bum outta me I would. - Samuel, I'm a professional man. There's no other way. Now you were in the racket, you oughta know that. - Yeah, but I gave it up 10 years ago. (phone rings) Sam, hello, yeah. Yeah, dear, potatoes, and bread, yeah, I'll pick it up. No, I won't forget. Yeah, goodbye, dear, I'll talk to ya later, bye bye. Your sister. - Your wife. Samuel, you are the last of the great gentlemen. Have a cigar. - Beat it, prom kid, you aint old enough. - [Marv] I'm not here to buy liquor. - Sorry, we're fresh out of Cokes. - Are you Sam Tallman? - [Sam] Yeah, so? - I understand you're a friend of Harry March. - Harry March, who's Harry March? - About the best safe cracker around, maybe the best in the business. - Never heard of him. - Okay, just thought you might be interested in a deal. - Wait a minute, kid, what kind of a deal? - What difference does it make? Said you didn't know him. - I make friends real easy. What kind of a deal? - A big deal. A million dollars cash. - A million dollars cash? Kid, I'm busy, why don't you go tell your fairytale someplace else. - I mean it, a million cash. - And so where is it, maybe it's in a mint, or maybe it's in Fort Knox. - It's about six blocks from here. - You're a liar. - Look, I know where the money is and I know how to get it. All I need is someone who can open a safe. - [Sam] So you aint lying, how does a punk like you know where a million dollars is? - Mr. Tallman, all my life my brain has been sort of a curse. Now maybe I can make it payoff for everybody. - Let's say that you know where the million is and let's say you have a plan how to get it, where do I come in and Harry? - Well, you just tell Harry to be here tomorrow night at eight o'clock. I'll explain it then. - Okay, kid, I'll have him here, but if you're lying-- - I've already had one beating today, I don't suppose another one would kill me. - Well, where's your young genius? - He said eight o'clock, it's only a few minutes after. - I'm surprised at you Samuel, this is obviously somebody's idea of a joke. - Look, that's what I thought at first, but I could swear he was on the level after talking to him awhile. - If there were a million dollars hanging about someplace every operator in the country would know about it. - Maybe so, but-- (knocking on door) That's probably him now. Here he is, Harry. - Marv Grant. - Harry March. - Glad to meet you, Mr. March, I've heard quite a bit about you. All good I might add, depending on which side of the law you rolled with. - Thank you. - Gentlemen, let's not be so polite, I can't keep the store closed forever. I gotta make a living. - Okay, sit down, I'll explain it to you. Now tomorrow night there's a freighter docking at the pier, the Rose Lee out of Hong Kong. - [Sam] So? - There's a shipment of pure heroin being smuggled in on that ship for delivery here. - Wait a minute, I refuse to have anything to do with narcotics. Besides it's a federal rap. - Yeah, besides you said it was cash. - I'm getting to that. Now a syndicate here has agreed to take the heroin off the hands of the present owners for a million dollars cash for leaving them with the risks and headaches of distributing and selling the stuff. - So we grab the million before it gets to the guys with the junk. - Exactly, one million dollars in untraceable, unmarked probably highly ill-gotten cash. - Very well, so far so good. Now what about our cut for Sam and me? - 55, 45. Take it or leave it. - We'll take it. Now what's the setup? - Walter Mathews is the middleman. - He's the guy that owns the warehouse on the dock, huh? - Right. The million dollars will be in his safe sometime tomorrow. At 11:15, Mathews and the dope owner arrive to exchange the heroin for the cash, except by then, we'll have the cash. - What's to prevent us from taking the money before it ever reaches the safe? - I don't know when it's coming or how. If I knew that, it'd be easy. As it is, we'll be in a little after 11:00 and out a little before 11:15. - Why can't we get in by 10:30 and out in plenty of time? - Well, it's not that easy. There's one main entrance to the warehouse, a slide and steel door locked from the inside. - So, how do we get in? - At exactly 11 o'clock, the second shift watchman comes on. The guard inside unlocks the door and the new guard goes in. We go in with him. Now you wouldn't mind knocking out a couple of guards for a half million dollars cash, would you? - I guess I can handle it. - All right, once we're in, there's only two things left, open the office door and open the safe. It's imperative that we be in and out in 10 minutes before Mathews and the other man arrive. Can you do it? - There isn't a safe built that I couldn't open within six minutes. - Good, well, that's it, any questions? - What about alarms? - Only two in the building, one at the main entrance and one at a smaller back entrance. We'll leave by the smaller back entrance, but don't worry about the alarm. It takes the police almost four minutes to respond and arrive to the scene. By that time, we'll be long gone. - Sounds good to me. - Sounds too good. Who ever heard of picking up a million that easy? - Well, it wouldn't be that easy, Sam, except for one thing. The holders of the money are involved in a rather illicit operation themselves, and they can't afford the elaborate protection, let's say a bank might. - You know when you think about it, we're doing the world a favor, taking the money from them. It helps keep the heroin off the market. - All right, anymore questions? Okay, we'll meet back here tomorrow night at 10 o'clock. And bring a car and a suitcase. - Oh, young man, I've worked with the best, but if you ask me, you've got a great future in this business. - I don't think so, Mr. March, as far as I'm concerned this is strictly a one shot affair. - Some kid, Harry, but real naive. - How do you mean? - I don't think it ever entered his mind that we could cross him. He spilled the plans, everything. What's to stop you and I from heisting the joint alone? - Just one thing, Sam, honor. If men like us don't have that, we don't have anything. (phone rings) - [Betty] Hello? - Hello, Betty, this is Marv. Please don't hang up, I've gotta talk to you. - No, thanks, I thought I made myself pretty clear. - Please, Betty, this is important. - [Betty] Okay, so talk. - Not on the phone, can you meet me somewhere? - [Betty] Why? - Money, Betty, lots of money. Money to buy everything you've ever wanted. Are you there, Betty? - Look, is this a gag? - I hope to die if it is. - [Betty] Where do you want me to meet you? - Joe's Diner, Seventh and Adams. - [Betty] Okay, goodbye. - Goodbye. Would you like some coffee? - No, let's just get to the point. - I'm gonna get some money, Betty. - Oh, really, how much? - Lots, enough to buy you all the diamonds and mink coats in the whole world. - Your boss make you president of the company or something? - No, but I'm getting it, I swear it. - Look, did you get me all the way down here just to talk? Now where are you getting this fortune? - I'm stealing it. - You're what? Oh, look, cut it out, will you? You haven't even got the nerve to lie. - I mean it Betty, I'm stealing a million dollars. - Look, you shouldn't joke about these things, Marv. - I'm not joking. I found out where there's going to be a million dollars cash and I've worked out a plan to steal it. - You're really serious, aren't you? You'd really do that for me? - Betty, I'm in love with you. - [Betty] Can you get away with it? - I know I can. I've got the best safe cracker in the business lined up to do it with me. - [Betty] When? - Saturday night at the warehouse. We'll, I have to split with the other guys, but there'll be over half a million for us. (mid-tempo rousing music) - I could have everything I've ever dreamed of. I could finally spit in his face. - You're crazy. You're out of your mind. - Oh, am I? Listen mister, I'm giving you a break you haven't got coming. - A break? Asking me to heist a million bucks from guys who'll be armed to the teeth? - So who says you can't carry a gun yourself? - Well, I never have. Look, I've copped radios, hubcaps, stuff like that, but I'm no big-time operator. - So what are you then? Vince, all you have to do is grab them when they come out with the money. Look, you can get Larry and Burt to help you. You don't have to tell them how much it is. Look, aren't I worth it? - I don't know. - Oh, let me clue you, buster, I'm getting out of this dump one way or the other. Now if you want me to go with Marv, that's okay. But I'm giving you the chance to take me. (slow uneasy music) - You, you wouldn't go with him. Not, not really. - Wouldn't I? For half a million bucks I'd go with anyone. - Even if you didn't love him? - Now, what's love got to do with it? - I don't know. - Look, Vince, I want you, I really do. I've wanted you for years, and you know it. But I want something else, too. Now maybe more than I want you even. And if I can have them both, that's great. But if I have to choose. (dramatic stirring music) Will you do it? - [Vince] Okay. (slow unsettling music) - Package here for Mr. Mathews. - Okay, I'll see he gets it. - Okay, buddy, thanks. (tense unsettling music) - [Walt] Kid, is that for me? - Yes, sir, it is. - Bring it in here, huh? - What you eatin', Pop, beans? - It's all we got in the house, you wanna bite? - No, you finish it. - You going out? - [Marv] Uh huh. - Well, don't you have some homework? - Pop, it's Saturday night, remember school finished Friday. - Oh, sure, yeah, I keep forgettin'. You got a date? - Yeah, sort of. - Marv, did you get your check? - [Marv] Pop, I don't get paid until the 15th, you know that. - Oh, yeah, that's right. - It's just that Mrs. Fischer's coming up for the rent tonight and I was wondering. - [Marv] You blew your job, didn't you? What happened, Pop? - He reconsidered, said he guessed I was too old. I don't know what to do, boy. Everywhere I turn, same thing happens. - Pop, everything's gonna be all right. - It aint fair to you, kid. No, it's true, I'm a burden.

It's the only direct street to the ferry. - We'll have to detour, hurry up. (dramatic gripping music) - We're done. (ferry horn blares) - There's another ferry in two minutes. All we can do is wait. - And pray. - What time is it? - It's 10:58. - We'll never make it. - We've got to, come on. Kill your lights. (tires screech) It's 11:04, we may have missed him. Come on.
