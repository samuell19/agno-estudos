Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. Jeepers. That was seriously scary. Come on, let's go again. Uh... Let's not and say we didn't. I'm with Daphne. The Ghost Coaster is by far the scariest ride at the Halloween Carnival. Are you kidding? Like, that ride put the "easy" in "cheesy." Yeah. Easy. Are you sure you weren't just a little bit scared? - By all the bloodsucking vampires? - Howling werewolves? And wicked witches. Nice try, gang, but Scoob and I aren't scared... ...of any of those phony old frights. Yeah, phony frights. - Come on. - Not even on Halloween night? Ha. Are you kidding? Like, Halloween is the one night when you know everything is fake. Just take a look around. It's nothing but wannabe witches and goofball ghosts... ...as far as the eye can see. Yum, yum. But I got to admit, a holiday invented just to eat candy can't be all bad. Hey, check it out. - This ought to be good. - I'll grab tickets before they sell out. - Like, beat that, Scoob. - Scooby-Dooby-Doo. - Scooby. - Scooby. Confounded mutt. Look what you've done. I'm soaked. Ugh! Wet-dog smell. Oh, wow. We know you. You're the Amazing Krudsky. We were just on our way to catch your act. Act? The Halloween Spectacular is no mere act. Now, out of the way. I must go blow-dry my cummerbund. So I guess we'll be seeing you inside. Three magic words: "No dogs allowed." Can you believe the nerve of this guy? "Master of magic." Please. Like, what a bunch of Halloween hooey. Yeah, hooey. Hey, that gives me an idea. Like, what do you say we get in on the act? Yeah? Once a year, on Halloween night... ... the powers of the dark meet the powers of the light. People of Coolsville... ...fix your slack-jawed gaze upon my dazzling powers. From the elegant parlors of Vienna to this unglamorous backwater... ...I, the Amazing Krudsky... ...have come to astound you. Abra-cam, kalabazam! Ta-da! Scooby-Dooby-Doo. Like, check it out. That's not magic. This table has a hole in it. Ooh! Confound it. You're ruining my... And would you look at that? Like, a trapdoor built right into the floorboards. That must be how he magically appeared on-stage. Ooh. Uh-huh, uh-huh. There's no mystery here, Scoob. Like, the Amazing Krudsky is just a make-believe magician. No. Please. Come back. I can explain. I'll get you for this. And your big dog too. Way to go, you two. You got us kicked out of the carnival. Now what are we supposed to do? Don't sweat it, gang. There's still one Halloween hoax we do believe in. - Trick or treat. - Trick or treat. Smell my feet. And give us something groovy to eat. Hey, Scoob. Like, check it out. The world's first candy hot tub. Yeah. Okay, I think that's enough trick-or-treating for one night. It's getting late. One more? Please? Okay, you guys go ahead. We'll grab the van and meet you back here. Scooby-Dooby-Doo. Blast those teenage troublemakers. If word of this gets out, I'll be ruined. It's not my fault I'm a big phony. I've spent a lifetime in search of real magic. I've studied every spell, spoken every incantation. There must be something I'm missing. Huh? The Goblin Scepter: Fabled wand of the great Goblin King. "Bewitched by the darkest magic... ...he who holds the Goblin Scepter holds the magic of Halloween in his grasp." It must be a sign. Somehow, someway, tonight the Goblin Scepter will be mine. Prepare yourself, Krudsky. You're finally going up in the world. Whoa, whoa! Who is responsible for this indignity? Think this is funny, do you? Show yourself this instant. Pesky insect. Gotcha. F... F... Fairy? Yes. "Fairy." "If a mortal catches a fairy on Halloween... ...the fairy's magic can be stolen using the following spell." By the fearful powers of Halloween night Give to me this fairy's light Here we are, Scoob. Last house on the block. Boy, you said it. Talk about a kooky crib. There's nothing to be afraid of, Scoob. It's just more Halloween hogwash. - But, like, shouldn't we have knocked first? - Yeah, we should've knocked. Like, check out this creepshow convenience store. Hey, Scoob. Like, just call me Merlin the mostest magician. - What is it, Scooby-Doo? - Magic mirror. Magic mirror. A magic mirror? Come off it, Scoob. What are you, afraid of your own shadow? Who dares speak of the shadows on Halloween night? - Huh? - Huh? A wizard must be careful with his words. Our bad. - Like, we're new here. - Yeah, new here. Always delighted to meet new customers. Always, always. Welcome to Mr. Gibbles'... ...where the magic is real at prices that are unreal. Sorry, but you got us all wrong. Like, we're not customers, we're consumers. - Like, trick or treat. - Trick or treat. Trick or treat, eh? Well, then, I choose "trick." Witches and warlocks Ghosts and ghouls One night a year They break all the rules You never know who's at the door On Halloween night Spirits from the shadows Creeping into the light Werewolves howl And vampires take a bite That's scary. Don't you know there's still hope? Take it from me You can have protection For a nominal fee Tonight the dark and light unite A magical mystery Spell books, potions They fly off the shelves We offer a discount To trolls and elves When danger's at the door On Halloween night If you master magic You can put up a fight Face your fears The power's here At Gibbles' the price is right Mr. Gibbles. Mr. Gibbles, please. Please open up. I need your help. Galloping ghosts. Fairy Princess Willow. - Fairy Princess? - Fairy Princess? Your Highness, what are you doing here? Please listen. There isn't much time. An evil magician has stolen my fairy powers. You must close the shop before he finds me here. Close my magic shop? On Halloween night? Oh, another one of your pixy pranks. This is no prank. Please, you must hurry before it's too late. Speaking of "late," like, don't bother showing us the door. If there's one thing we know, it's how to make an exit. Mr. Gibbles' Genuine Magic Shoppe. My, what an impressive emporium. Mind if I have a quick look around? I'm sorry, we were just closing for the night. Perhaps you can come back next year? I've waited long enough. Mirror, mirror, tall and sleek Show me the fairy that I seek Ah. There you are. Fickle fairy. Thought you could escape while my back was turned? Typical mortal. Stealing my fairy magic isn't enough? Once you have a little power, all you want is more, more, more. I know. Isn't it marvelous? Now, obey your master. Dominatum triumphus! No. Anti-villainous desistus! Old fool. Ears of fuzz, tail of cotton Powers of good Meet the powers of rotten Now, hop along. I'll just pick up a few things while I'm here. Zoinks. Don't look now, Scoob... ...but I think the Not-So-Amazing Krudsky just got his act together. Don't worry, lads. We may yet save the Fairy Princess and Halloween. I've still got a few tricks up my sleeve. Like, that's not his sleeve. Uh-uh. Like, we'd love to stick around, but I just remembered... ...Scoob and I are deathly allergic to magical talking rabbits. Uh-huh. Crystal burning bright with fire Future secrets I desire Oh, Scooby-Doo, where are you? - Huh? - Huh? This shall teach you to meddle in the affairs of magicians. - Oh, no. - Zoinks! Like, that magical maniac... ...just gave the gang an extreme monster makeover. No, my friends. It is the future you have seen. What? Like, the future? As in, stuff that hasn't happened yet and therefore might be changed... ...if we embark on a perilous quest to alter the hand of destiny? Like, that kind of future? Something like that, yes. - Like, I was afraid of that. - Yeah. Me too. We must act quickly. See for yourselves. The magic scepter of the great Goblin King himself. - Great Goblin King? - Great Goblin King? Don't you see? Krudsky has stolen the light magic from Princess Willow. Now he only needs the dark magic of the Goblin Scepter... ...to complete his power. Okay. Like, that doesn't sound so bad. Not so bad? It would destroy the very balance of the supernatural order. This world would fall into chaos... ...and the powers of Halloween night would rule here forever... ...turning everyone into horrible Halloween monsters... ...just like your friends. Well, when you put it that way... You must travel to the land of the Halloween spirits. There you will seek the hidden castle of the great Goblin King. Sneak into the castle undetected, grab the Goblin Scepter... ...and make your escape before the stroke of midnight. Like, is that all? Scoob, old buddy, like, next year... ...what do you say we just skip Halloween and go right on to Thanksgiving? I wish there was more I could do for you, but take these. They should serve you well on the other side. A deck of cards? These are magic cards. Hold one out like so... ...and read the inscription. Like, "demented disguises." Hey, check it out, Scoob. Like, our very own monster mash-up. Cool. Marvelous. You'll have no trouble blending in now, eh? - Let's try another one, Scoob. - Okay. No, no, no. You have to save them for emergencies. Each card can be used only once. And be careful, each magic spell lasts but a short time. - Huh? - Huh? Speaking of time, you've got a train to catch. Like, check out that freaky freight train. Yeah, freaky. Attention. After-world Express with one-way, nonstop service to: Sleepy Hollow, Hangman's Corner... ...and Ghost Central Station. Scoob, old buddy, I think we're in for the ride of our afterlives. One last thing. Whatever happens, you must return by sunrise... ...or be trapped in the spirit world forever. Back by sunrise, trapped forever. Got it. But, like, how are we supposed to get back? Oh, dear, I hadn't thought about that. - Huh? - Huh? Zoinks. Don't look now, Scooby-Doo... ...but I think we're riding on the Grim Reaper railroad. Like, stop the train. We want off this loco locomotive. Like, we made it, Scoob. We're on the ground. The sweet, sweet ground. You there. What do you think you're doing, eh? Trying to sneak into my boneyard while my back was turned? I think our disguises have lost their charm. Oh, a couple of wiseacres, eh? Believe me, laddies, you don't want to see my bad side. Like, this being your bad side? Time for a late-night snack. Like, hold on. You wouldn't eat a fellow werewolf, would you? Huh? Observe. Stone me, it's one of my own brethren. Come on, then. Come on. Sorry about the rough reception, mate. Gotta keep out the riff-raff now, don't we? Zoinks. Like, this is one whacked-out watering hole. Blah, blah, blah, blah. Ooh, ooh, ooh. Okay, Scoob, like, just be cool. Yeah. Be cool. Like, great party, huh? So, what's a nice ghoul like you doing in a place like this? Zoinks. Like, forget I asked. Gather around your underground And listen to a song We can rock this joint till dawn If you sing along - Hey - What goes bump in the night? We go bump in the night This time of year, the coast is clear To cause a terrible fright We go bump in the night It'll be out of sight We come out for a bite Tonight we toast to ghouls and ghosts Who haunt the pale moonlight - What goes bump in the night? - We go bump in the night We go bump in the night - So if you're new - Here's what you do Take your turn and sing Like, anybody know the way To the castle of the Goblin King? Goblin King? Like, was it something we said? Goblin patrol. - Hold it right there. You've done it now, boys. No one dares speak of the Goblin King. - Ow. What'd you do that for? - You said "Goblin King." - Hey. - Don't say "Goblin King." You said it first. - Did not. You started it. - I have a right to. You said it first. Come on, Scoob. Right now is our chance to vamoose. Wait. - You said it first. I can do what I want, because I'm the first one in. Hang on there. Just where do you think you're going? It's off to the goblin dungeons for you. Come on, the party's just getting started. So tell me, goblin boy... ...is this a private fight, or can anybody join in? Like, why not? The more the scarier. Step aside, you. Nobody messes with the Shadow Goblins. Ooh! What are you gonna do, breathe on me? Ha-ha! If you wanna go a few rounds... ...with old Jack o' Lantern right here, right now... ...let's rumble. Come on, take it easy there, Jack. Come on, we're only doing our jobs. Please. Wait till we tell the Goblin King about this. You're gonna be in so much trouble. - Shut it, will you? - Hey, what'd I say? You said "Goblin King." You got me... - Wanna get in trouble? You said "Goblin King." - You're in trouble. You're the one that says it all the time. Psst. Hey, come on. This place is dead. Ha-ha! You better watch it. The last thing you want tonight are those good-for-nothing goblins coming after you. But I gotta give you props. The Goblin King's castle? What a riot. You guys are whacked. I love it. So, like, does that mean you'll help us? Look, you guys crack me up, but I can't hang with you. I got my own deadline tonight. See my candle? That's how long I got to get my Halloween on. Once it burns out, I'm burned out. You know what I'm saying? Like, who's the creep with the missing cranium? The Headless Horseman. I am so tired of working with this guy. Quick, you gotta help me. "Shield of safety." "Wall of gnome." "Force of flowers." "Clown calamity." "Baby on a frog." The magic cards. Scooby-Dooby-Doo. I got him. Head for the covered bridge. It's our only chance. Ah! Zoinks. Like, why did he stop? Well, duh, that's the Horseman's one fatal flaw: He can't cross covered bridges. Like, I guess it's true what they say: "It's tough to get ahead in this town." Shaggy, Scooby. Guess they're not here, either. This place is deserted. Not quite. Look. Mirror, mirror on the wall... ...who's the most dreadful goblin of all? What wizard dare disturb the great Goblin King? Greetings, your royal awfulness. The Amazing Krudsky, at your service. Foolish mortal... ...to what purpose do you summon the ruler of the goblin hordes? Say hello to my little fairy friend. Fairy Princess Willow. Jeepers, a real-life fairy. Maybe Krudsky's magic is real after all. But that's impossible. Rational mind shutting down. What loathsome trickery is this? No tricks. Only a trade. Meet me at the clock tower, midnight-ish. There I shall release her to you in return for your Goblin Scepter. Most foul and wicked wizard. You tempt powers beyond your grasp. You shall regret this. Soon, all the powers of Halloween shall be mine... ...and then I'll show that scruffy slacker and his mangy mutt, Scooby-Doo... ...a magic trick they'll never forget. Shaggy and Scooby are in big trouble. We've gotta find them before that whacked-out warlock does. And what about that adorable little fairy? We can't just let that icky Goblin King take her away. Right, Velma? Oh, no, Velma's fried. All this must have overloaded her rational brain. Then it's up to us, Daphne. We've gotta get over to that clock tower before midnight... ...and set a trap for that magic maniac. Come on. End of the line, guys. There's the witch's hut, just like I promised. Look, I gotta bounce, but they can help you find the Goblin Castle. You know, assuming they don't eat you first. - Eat us? - Eat us? Are you sure you won't come with us, Jack? Sorry, guys, but those old bags take one look at me and, splat, I'm pumpkin pie. You know what I'm saying? But, like, how are we gonna get along without you? We haven't got any magic left. Yeah, how? Are you kidding? You guys rescued me from the Brainless Horseman, hello? That took real courage. And everybody knows courage is the most powerful magic of all. Like, I hate to tell you, but that wasn't courage, that was panic. Hey, whatever you call it, it's working for you. Keep it unreal, and happy Halloween! Boil and bubble, toil and trouble If it's too weak, then make it a double For once in our lives, Scoob, like, I hope we're too late for supper. It is very rude to linger in doorways. Eye of snake and tongue of rat Pie of rhubarb, wing of bat There, now. It's almost ready. Here, taste. No, thanks. I'd really rather... Boy, do I feel sluggish all of a sudden. Zoinks! I knew it. Not enough dragon's tooth. Like, hang on, Scoob. We gotta make a beeline from this feline. No, no, no. This will never do. Quite right. More meat on them this way. Come, my sweets. We'd just love to have you for dinner. Wish we could stay... ...but you see, we just stopped in to ask for directions. Yes, we can guide you to the hidden lair of the Goblin King. But first you must help us. There are bad omens everywhere tonight. Some dark force has upset the supernatural balance. Catastrophe rides on the wind. I'm afraid I've had to cancel my midnight ride. Naturally, my magic broomstick is devastated. - Magic broomstick? - Magic broomstick? Poor thing. He was so looking forward to it. It's very bad to break a magic broom's spirit. Once broken, they are never the same again. All right, Broomy, enough moping. These nice boys are going to take you out for a spin... ...aren't you, boys? Scoob, old buddy... ...like, why do I get the feeling that we're the ones about to get spun? Oh, no. Now, hold on tight. Lean forward for faster, back to slow down, and watch out: He's got a wild streak in him. Just loves to take off on you. But don't let him. - Like, got all that, Scoob? - No. Here, you'll need this to get inside the castle. It's magic potion. My own secret recipe, made from Scratch. Poor old Scratch. Take them to the old oak Grove. From there, the fairies will guide you to the Goblin Castle. But beware. It's a hideous place filled with the most horrible monsters imaginable. And do write. Hey, Scoob, I think we're getting the hang of this thing. Scooby-dooby-doo! Hey, look. Let's shoot them down. Bring out the goblin blaster. Get them, get them. Fire. Mayday, mayday. We're going down. Like, are we dead? Of course you're not dead. You big sillies. Name's Sparkplug. I'm Honeybee. And I'm Tiddlywink. Welcome to the City of the Fairies. Look over here. Your broomstick. Oh, no. Poor Broomy. Broomy. Don't worry. A little fairy magic will have him fixed up in no time. Wow. Like, who knew fairies could be so friendly? Of course. We fairies use only good magic... ...balancing out all the bad magic used by the Shadow Goblins. - But tonight the balance is shifting. - I fear something terrible is happening. We know all about it. If we can catch a lift to the Goblin Castle, we may be able to stop it. We can show you the way, but you'll never get inside. The castle will be crawling with guards for the Goblins' Rave. - Goblins' Rave? - Goblins' Rave? Yeah, she's right. You'll never get in. It's totally the biggest party of the year. You don't say? If there's one thing we know how to do, it's crash a party. Yeah. The Goblin Graveyard hides the secret entrance... ...but it's only a one-way trip. Express elevator going down. Like, on second thought, maybe we should just take the stairs. In you go. Bye-bye. Zoinks. Like, first floor, creepy Goblin Castle. Come on, back up. Knock it off, knock it off. You, get a shower. You stink. You ain't on the list, you ain't getting in. Losers. Okay, Scoob. Here goes. Over the lips and past the gums. Look out, stomach, you're not gonna like this. Oh, boy. Hello, boys. Hello. Hello, pretty ladies. Hello, gals. We... We don't see your kind around here too often. I bet you say that to all your goblin girlfriends. We just love goblin parties. Like, tell me, gruesome... ...any chance you could use sneak us in? Well, I don't know. All right, all right. I'm gonna get in trouble for this, but in you go. Like, thanks, you big horrible thing, you. She had it all going on. Yeah, yeah, yeah, but did you see her friend? What a dog. Rock 'n' roll, baby. Rock 'n' roll. It's midnight tonight. It's Halloween. Shaggy, look. That must be His Royal Rottenness himself. And look, there's the Goblin Scepter. Zoinks! Only five minutes till midnight. We gotta grab the scepter and hightail it out of here. Like, on the count of three. Ready? One, two, three. Well, hello, my lovelies. Don't be shy, now. Let's have a dance. Dance? Now? Hit it. Swing it, boys. Yeah. Zoinks! Like, only one minute to midnight, Scoob. What's this? Way to go, Scoob, old buddy. Gangway. Impostors. Seize them. Left turn, Scoob. Right turn, Scoob. Like, dead end. Who dares disrupt the Goblins' Rave? Like, don't mind us. We were just leaving. The goblin hour has arrived. You are free, my minions. Go forth this night... ...and let goblin mischief reign. O great one, what you want we should do with them? Yeah, what do we do? What do we do? Take them to the tower dungeon. Tower dungeon? Like, any chance we could put in for an upgrade? Enough talk. Be thankful that I have more urgent matters to deal with. Take them away. Show yourself, wicked warlock. Greetings, Your Majestic Malignancy. Thank you for coming. I do so admire your punctuality. Show me the princess or be destroyed. You wouldn't dare use magic against me... ...so long as I have her under my spell. Why, here she is now, unharmed, as promised. And now, if you please, the Goblin Scepter. Beware, mortal. You know not the powers you are dealing with. - Jeepers. - Shh! Blahbiddy, blah, blah, blah. Cough it up already. So be it. Now, Daphne. Gotcha. Ladies and gentlemen... ...the Amazing Krudsky, version 2.0. Well, well. Look at the big, bad Goblin King. Release me at once. I'll take over from here, junior. No! Now, who's next? Okay. That was not part of the plan. Run for it. Shadow Goblins, have your fun. Halloween has just begun. Boy, Scoob, did we screw up this time. Like, game over. Yeah, game over. Now we'll never make it back before sunrise... ...and be trapped in the spirit world forever. Still, we gave it one heck of a try, didn't we, Scoob? We did? I mean, think about how far we came. That took courage, stamina, brains. And, like, those are things we don't have. Yeah. Uh-uh. I just wish we had one more chance to save the day. Did somebody say "wish"? Lucky for you, granting wishes is what we do best. Hey, our fairy friends. Like, we're saved. Yippee! Hey, good for you guys. Well, come on. Your ride is here. Shaggy, look. Broomy, you're back in action. Come on, Scoob. Like, we're going for the sweep. What's up, dog? Jack, you came back. Hey, there's still a little fire left in this old pumpkin. Come on. Let's carve. Whoo-hOOGIE! Tonight, Halloween is under new management. All hail the Goblin King. What is your command, o great one? How about a little target practice? What's happening? Where am I? Not so fast. Jinkies. Ladies and gentlemen, I present the Monstrous Machine. Look out. The van's coming apart. Now, that is something you just do not do to a guy's van. Run! Head for the carnival. Jinkies. Jeepers, we're stuck. This shall teach you to meddle in the affairs of magicians. - Do something, Freddie. - I am doing something. I'm panicking. Oh, Scooby-Doo. Where are you? At last. My magic powers are complete. Who could dare stop me now? Scooby-Dooby-Doo! Take that. Hang on. We're coming around. Here we go, Jack. Yee-haw! Like, nice catch, Scoob. Scoob? I've had it up to here with you meddling meddlers. The Goblin Scepter is mine. Let me have it. You heard the man, Scoob. Like, let him have it. I hate you. Like, who says you can't teach an old dog new tricks? Oh, thank heavens. Look, gang. The spell is broken. I'm free. Uh-oh. But not for long. I got you, Scoob. You ham-fisted hecklers. Just wait until I... Trick or treat. No! Princess Willow... ...the trouble you have caused this night is inexcusable. I know, and I'm sorry, Daddy. Daddy? I shouldn't have snuck out early, and I'll never do it again, I promise. As of now, you are officially grounded for one year... ...but I'm awfully glad to have you back, my little princess. So all's forgiven, then? You know, Krudsky, you really are my kind of guy. Really? You mean you'll help me with my career? Let's just say where you're going... ...you'll have lots of time to practice your act. No, I don't wanna go back yet. Do we have to? - Come on. - Come on. Poor old Jack. He's all burnt out for another year. Looks like our time is up. We'd best say our goodbyes now. - Goodbyes? - Goodbyes? Come along, Broomy. It's time we got you home. Great job, my young wizards. Be sure to stop by the magic shop next year. Your Majesty, if you please. Hey, hey! What do you say? Jack lives to see another day. Yippee! Hey, take it easy, Scoob. You're gonna slobber my new candle out. Hey. Come on, Jack. Time to fly. Gotta buzz, coz. Jack o'Lantern out! Thank you all so much. May the magic of the fairies be with you. Like, I'll never, ever forget this. Me neither. Bravest of mortals, you shall indeed remember... ...but all others must forget. By the shining rays of dawn All memory of this night be gone I want my mommy! - What just happened? - Hey, gang! Like, where you been? We've been looking all over for you. Shaggy. Scooby. What happened to you guys last night? Like, you wouldn't believe us if we told you. Well, gang, another Halloween carnival come and gone. I hate to say it... ...but don't you think we're getting a little old for this stuff, Freddie? It does seem a little bit silly to go around... ...pretending to believe in monsters and magic. Even if it is just one night a year. Real or unreal? Like, what's the difference? Like, the truth is... ...you never know where your next scare is gonna come from. You've just gotta find the courage to deal with it face to face. Zoinks! Like, it's that headless horror from the Halloween world. Scooby-Dooby-Doo! Hit it!
