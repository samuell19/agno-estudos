Subtitles by explosiveskull Detective Rainer, in pursuit of suspected felon, Brad Tinkerman. Rainer, this time wait for back up. Repeat, wait for back up. Negative, Dispatch. I'm not letting this scumbag Tink get away again. Rainer! Rainer! Come in! Goddamn it, Rainer! Give it up, brother! Come on, Tink. You've been ratted out. There's nowhere to go, anyway. Oh, Jesus Christ! It's gonna be all right. Batter up. Order! Order! Your honor, I submit Exhibits D through F. This is a clear case of kidnapping and human trafficking, both level one felonies. Your Honor, the State rests. Bradley Tinkerman, for your wonton indifference to human life you are awarded the maximum sentence. Go gently to you maker. Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck! Fuck! No! Mr. Caddock, is the new death penalty system working? Violent crimes are down 50% since my election, so, yes, I'd say the new death penalty is working fine. Was Tinkerman working for The Night organization? Any closer to catching those who've been terrorizing the city? Why all the human trafficking? What do the need the bodies for? We continue to uncover vital information. Major indictments will follow. The days when decent people have to live in fear are over. Now the criminals have something to fear... Me. - In that case, what is your... - Thank you. All right, hit each other! Your man Tinkerman got shit-canned. I know. Our friend Caddock. Yeah, well, you know what he was carrying? Encrypted data chip. Thousands of files. And now Caddock's got it. Well, that's not good. Guys, if we don't get that chip, we're fucked. All of us. Or worse. That's why it's your job to get it back. No. No. We don't take orders from you. Orders didn't come from me, shithead. They came from The Night. I didn't think you'd pick up. I didn't recognize the number. Yeah, well, I'm on secure landline, so... We have dinner reservations at 8:00. Come on. It's your favorite restaurant. Or have all your tastes changed? - Sir? - My instincts are right as usual, Yasha. This data chip they found on Tinkerman looks like it might be the key to something big. There are layers of encryption on that baby that I have never seen before. Wow! We'll crack it. No doubt about it. I've already downloaded it to the private server. Start decoding the data ASAP. And I don't want anyone knowing about this. Not yet. - Okay? - Yes, sir. This is the jewel in my crown. I can feel it. I'm taking the rest of the day off. Gonna treat myself to a beautiful plaything. And the car ain't bad either. This is just, like, a little bit over the top. Oh, really? Well, it feels pretty understated to me. - Come on. - I'm sorry. I don't make the rules here. Oh. You don't make the rules here? Well, that must be... very hard for you with your overwhelming control issues. Oh, no. No. No. I... I don't have those anymore. - Oh! Wow. - Yeah, I'm, uh... - You know, I'm really relaxed now. Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah. - Super relaxed. - Mmm. Yeah, no. Me too. I feel so relaxed right now. - Don't you? - Yeah. Yeah. So chill. All right. All right. You win. I usually do. Not everything has to be a fight to the death. Since when? Since I lost you. You know, James... You only want things when you can't have them. Okay? And this whole new self-aware shit, it's not gonna work on me because I am not a dumb-dumb. I know. I know. And I want to apologize for how I treated you. And thank you for joining me tonight. - Thanks. - Enjoy. Just, uh... feels amazing sitting opposite you. So thank you. - I'm not charmed. - Yeah, okay. Don't. 'Cause this is just... It's a really good risotto. What has changed so much? You, uh, ordered the exact same thing you did the last six times we went to that restaurant. - Look, when... - Fascinating! Yeah, okay. If I find something that I like, and it's good every time, - I'll go back to it. - Oh, wow. What a coincidence. It's, uh, our song. Yeah. Coincidence. Hey, will you, uh, accompany me on a starlit joyride? I am not sleeping with you. I would never assume. Fancy car. Yeah, I bought it today. The Lazarus One. The CPU this baby has, it can practically drive itself. It doesn't have a cup holder? Hang on. Okay, could you slow down? - What, are you scared? - No! You're driving like an asshole. The only way to cut through this filth is quickly. Filth? Come on. This is a neighborhood with people. - Okay. Yeah. Yeah. - Human beings, families. You wanna live here? I used to. You know that. And how many locks do you have on your door now? It's always about fear with you. Don't play your games with me. I'm not the girl you knew. Yeah. Because of me. You know, no one likes an angry woman, Daria. I knew this was a mistake. Take me home. Now. This world is a fucked up mess, Daria. You and I are the only thing that ever made sense to me. And I will not stop coming for you until you are mine. The last thing I wanna see right now is your fucking worm face. Talk fast, Yasha. I think I can bypass the security on the chip. Bad news is, I'd have to use some marginally illegal software to do it. We'll need court approval. To hell with that. No. I'm breaking this case tonight. But, really, sir, we are right on the border of an illegal search. I could file a motion. We'd have a warrant tomorrow afternoon. Fine, do it. It won't matter anyway. Now go home. Who are you? Mr. Caddock? If you don't mind, sir, I'd like to clock out. What? No, no, no. Yasha should've told you I want a guard 24/7 Well, It's just that I've got this terrible headache. Guards! All right, take a seat. - Guards! - So... Where's the chip? I don't know what you're talking about. No, no. No. Please. No, please! No! No! Please! Which takes us back to the original question... Where is the chip? I don't know. You don't know who you're fucking with! Counselor, Counselor, Counselor... Let me start by saying your efforts to clean up this city have been... admirable. But I think you'll agree, that this is some caked-on, baked-on dirt. Now, when a man is frightened or desperate, I would expect him to lie. I expect him to bargain. I expect him to beg. But do not... Do not expect me to stop. You are all gonna die for this. Ooh! You first. Well, I think we can rule out suicide. Good to see you too, Greyvenstein. How's that wife of yours? - Attractive yet demanding. - Well, you keep her happy. Those BBQs at your place keep me living till the next one. What a shit show. Yeah. You pulled the footage off the security cameras? Not yet. Look, Rainer, this was a professional hit. And I don't want to speak ill of the dead, Caddock was a certified cock-sucker. Every psycho in the city wanted to see him killed. Probably some regular folks, too. Yeah, I'm sure it's hopeless, but we should probably at least try and look busy. Mmm. - Big feet. - Oh, my God! You're the Assistant DA. Yes. Sorry. I'm a little overwhelmed right now. Understandable. I just have one question. All Caddock's files were destroyed. Seems the perpetrators were looking for something. Was there anything sensitive Caddock was working on right now? Maybe something that might have put a lot of bad guys in a tight spot? No, not anything out of the ordinary. Not that I can think of. Would you excuse me, Detective? I need to make a statement to the press. Still, I'm gonna need to see all Caddock's current investigations. If you could hand over any back-up materials... Yeah, of course. Anything to help. Oh, ADA, do you know where the security footage is kept? Security suite, first floor. - Hopefully, the cameras caught everything. - Yeah. Hopefully. Well, after Payne removed his intestines and Jag got his molars, Henry just sort of tossed him out the window. Sounds like a splendid evening. But I am a tad confused on one detail. At what point did you find the data chip? We even searched the house. Nothing there. Sir, that's what we have so far. That's the only person we saw him talk to. - We don't know who she is. - She's probably swarmed with surveillance by now. Look at this. The human body. A squishy pouch of paper skin filled with soft cartilage, tender muscles, quivering organs. Pathetic. Why did nature equip lesser creatures with exoskeletons? Poison-tipped tails? Why are such gifts considered out of reach? I'll tell you why. Because God has forsaken you, but I didn't. I made you whole. You, my creations, will be the ones to rule this city. You go out and you find it. And if you don't, I will squash you to jelly if you disappoint me again. Now, get out of here. Who's in there? When we were together, he would always tell me how to eat, how to dress, how to laugh. I hated it. Even when we were apart, he was always a sort of a... shadow in my life. But it was also comforting. Hey, look. Mourn all you want, but don't confuse grief with love. He shattered your heart over and over. He did. But he taught me a lot, too. The way he taught me to stand up straight and smile even if I was screaming "fuck you" on the inside. Well, you say it on the outside, too. You said it to me, like, 30 times this week, you know? - Hello? - Ms. Morris. Nice of you to finally picked up. This is Detective Rainer. I'm investigating the James Caddock case. - I need to ask you a few questions. - Can't this wait? No. Every second counts. You saw James Caddock the night he was killed. We had dinner. What'd you talk about? I don't know. Old times. Did Caddock talk about his work? Look, I'm still pretty upset. Well, lady, a man is dead. So why don't you try putting aside your personal feelings for a minute and answer my questions. Hey, kid, your mom home? Whoa! Bobby? What the fuck is going on out there? You've got a lot of nerve showing up here. I need some information. Did Tink ever tell you who he was running for? All he said was he working for The Night. Said he was running a big score. But he was always saying that. Right. Keep that kid on a leash. One for the road. You want some? You got no idea who you're messing with, you rich fuck. Boss, someone's after me. Another suicide, huh? Man, this town's getting too rough for me. A bunch of bums laying dead on the streets, now this mess? His name's Henry. Got a rap sheet long as my dick. That's long. What am I doing down here? You know I'm working the Caddock case. - Big feet. - Yeah, big feet. Jesus, Petrov. Are you doing some actual police work? Yeah, I told him it's a waste of time but he's young. It's a pretty sophisticated equipment. Any idea who might've installed that? Nah. It's like nothing I've seen before. Anyway, I figure he took off on foot and they chased him in here. - In what? You get an ID on the vehicle? - Yeah, uh... Big, black luxury sedan. Huh. You think it's connected to Caddock? Maybe. Call me when you've got something on this guy. Yeah. - What's wrong with you? - What? He has big feet. Just get to work. Weather sucks. Oh, let me guess. Detective Insensitive Asshole? Rainer. Look, I'm sorry I don't have any of those... What're they called? - Social skills? Yeah. - Mmm-hmm. Yeah. I just need to figure out what Caddock was up to, and so far, all I know is he was hung up on you. You know he was monitoring your email? Well, it's not surprising. Look, I hadn't talked to him in a long time. But you talked to him that night. I gotta tell you, this case gives me a weird feeling in my gut. Could be your diet. Yeah, that sucks, too. Come with me. You really wanna go over this again? You saw Caddock the night he died. Like I told you before, it was just dinner. It's never just dinner. True. There was always an ulterior motive with him... But, uh... I think it was just to sleep with me. Yeah, well, to be honest, I couldn't stand the guy. Yeah, well, you and everyone else. James killed criminals, and criminals killed James. I don't know what else to say. It's the world we live in, right? No. I don't accept that. He was the goddamn DA. This has gotten crazy. Somebody's gotta... bring some decency back to this place and it starts with finding the fuckers who did this. - You sound like him. - No. No. I won't... I wanna make this place better. Safer. Am I nuts? No. No, you're not nuts. And I hope you do. But I'm telling you, I don't have any information for you. You wouldn't know of any of Caddock's friends who own a black sedan? Luxury mark? James just bought a car like that. What kind of car do you drive? - A white one. - And if I asked you to account for your whereabouts? Look, I've already given my statement, so I would say, "Good night, Detective Rainer." I don't think those people got what they were after. So if these people are still looking, they might start looking at you. Okay. Thanks for the tip. I hope you can afford the check. Bingo, bitch. Hey, asshole! This is an executive parking spot. - Yeah, what do you got? - Caddock's assistant sent over his files. What's left of them, anyway. If I didn't know better, I'd say somebody hit these with the electronic eraser. Hmm. Hey, you know anyone you can trust over at Metro? I got a guy over there. Send him to keep an eye on Daria Morris' house. Protection or surveillance? Not sure yet. Get a grip, girl. - Call Mila. - Calling Mila. It's getting late. No. No, no, no. Please. Please don't leave me alone with my sad life. No, don't do your puppy eyes with me. They won't work. Don't even try. Okay. Fine. I've got another tactic. Come here. Whoa, wait. Is that a good idea? Ah, let me tell you... tequila was never my problem. My problem was everything else. Fuck it. You're a grown-ass woman, right? The verdict is still out. Okay, now. Here we go. Your eyes lead the body, okay? Okay. Weight on this foot, yeah? And you swing around - You do not want to fuck with me. - Oh. Copy that, Dispatch. I'm at the location. All's quiet here. Damn! No! Help! Now, don't you stress a thing. I'm gonna be real, real patient with you. Now, I am supposed to take you... What the fuck? - Mila? - Mila's dead, bitch! Fuck! Who the fuck are you? I'm gonna get you, and that hunk of fuckin' tin you're hiding in. Bitch. Bitch. Bitch. Bitch! Back the fuck up. Come on, damn it. Come on. Fuck, come on! Fuck! Fuck! No! No! No! You sure you didn't see the driver? Ms. Morris, are you all right? Is there anybody you can stay with tonight? Friends? Family? It's just me. I'm back. - Hey. - I didn't like the look of that continental breakfast. This should hold you through the day. I'll come back and check on you tonight. You keep the windows drawn. Anybody knocks, you hide. Even the cops could be in on this. You can trust Greyvenstein, but that's it. Oh, no. I'm not staying here. Look, I can smell whoever OD'd on this bed, and it's making me wish it was me. Ms. Morris, the people who are after you, they don't give a shit about your life. I didn't spend all night in that shitty chair just to watch you get yourself killed. At least until I know what you're about. Wait a minute, am I witness or a suspect? Depends on who's driving that car. Seriously? - Nice. - I'm coming with you. - The hell you are. - According to you, I'm the one with everything to lose. If these assholes are trying to kill me, I want to know who and why. You're pushy as hell, you know that? I like bossy better. I read your file. Just cause you're from the neighborhood doesn't make you an automatic badass. You'd be surprised. All right, you want to help, fine. But we've got to tell each other the truth. No secrets. Deal. So what aren't you telling me? Nothing. So what next? - We're going to the Market. - Really? To the Data Market? Well, then give me back my gun. Do you think it's safe for you to be here? Eh, the Market's neutral. They're not gonna kill me just 'cause I'm a cop. At least, I think not. Buying or selling? Looking to trade. Sealed police records in exchange for information on someone. Three queries for one. This way. You've been here before? Once or twice. What exactly did you do as a kid? Bad shit. Your offer is no good. You want to trade legal information for illegal information. You son of a bitch, we're trying to take a maniac off the street. All you gotta to do is press a fucking key. Cash deal. Final offer. Okay. - Make it count. - All right. We're looking for someone or something that calls itself The Night. The Night. There is a man. Talen. The Seer. The Surgeon. Go! Go! I'll be there in a minute. You're all gonna die. Daria. Who the fuck are you? Look, what do you people want? You and me, we're both ambitious women. And you know the world hates an ambitious woman. So why don't we join forces, huh? I'm about three seconds from shooting you, lady. So tell me what you want. Just tell me where Caddock hid the chip. I don't know anything about a chip. Are we done? You're coming with me! You're gonna burn, bitch. Yeah! Time's up, asshole. - Freeze! - Get your hands up! No, don't shoot! Hold on. Don't shoot! I'm a cop. You! Did I faint? Oh, God, that's so lame. No. No. No. You didn't faint. You almost died from smoke inhalation. Oh. Good. I can still be cool, then. You might wanna ice whatever hurts. You want a drink? No. Yes. No! No. I've got some Russian-grade painkillers. They're not exactly FDA approved, but... I'm good. Thanks. This is your place? Yeah. I didn't peg you as a fish guy. They're great listeners. All right. I don't get many visitors. Huh. - Is that your... - Yeah. She was my daughter. What happened? Same thing happens every day. Good person, wrong place. Hour doesn't go by that I don't think about her. Even after all of these years. And all this... All these computers and shit, this should've been man's golden age and we're still vicious, hateful animals. And I'm full of hate, too. I don't think my daughter would be very proud of me. Well, I know why you have those dumb fish. Why? 'Cause we all need something to take care of in life, right? I mean, it's... It feels good to make something happy. Even if it's just a fucking fish. And hell, it's okay to be angry. I'm a raging maniac. I used to be a raging drunk, too. How'd you stop? Well, now I just... let it out by kicking the crap out of my punching bag. - Yeah? - Yeah. Show me. Come on. Show me. Uh, I don't know. - What? - I don't know if you can handle all this. I think I'll be all right. - Yeah? - Yeah, give me your best shot. That's pretty good. - Yeah? - Yeah. Guy once told me, "No one likes an angry woman." Well, somebody had a small penis. Welcome all my scoundrels, my delinquents, my creations. You know why I have called you. Two of my men in two days. Two of my perfect creations. Gone. And you can't tell me anything about this mystery car or the godforsaken bastard driving it. And now, little Ms. Needs-to-Die has vanished. And I still don't know where Caddock hid my data. A fool has declared war on The Night. I need this car stopped and I need that chip. So to the man who brings it to me, unlimited access to my merchandise. And the man who brings me the girl, the modification of your choice. I want the girl... the car, and everybody who ever even smiled at Caddock torn to teeny, tiny shreds. We do not sleep! We do not fail! The Night is coming! You ever eat real food? I figure a stray bullet will get me before the diabetes does. Jeez, you're bleak. - What'd we get? - Mmm. - A whole lot of money changing hands. - Mmm. But we didn't get a full download, so no names, no locations. - Just a mess in numbers. - Mmm. Talen? Not much to find. Um, low-level weirdo. Busted a number of years back for black market cybersurgery and then, nothing over a decade. - Yeesh. - Yeah. I figure he's blind. Or was. Maybe night vision? He's hiding underground? Well, he doesn't look much like a beach guy. I want to tell you something. But I don't want you to think I'm nuts. Okay. I'll give you a fair shot. - You promise? - Yeah. I promise. I don't think anyone is driving that car. - You think it's self-driving? - No. I actually think it's something else. I think it's Caddock. Oh, Daria, Caddock is dead. I saw the body. It was him. I know. I know. What I'm saying is... I think Caddock is the car. - You're fucking with me? - No, just listen. You're supposed to know your enemy, right? Well, no one knows James the way that I do and I am telling you, he is controlling that car. I know it sounds crazy and I don't have an explanation for it, maybe some kind of, I don't know, AI shit, but it's him. It is the worst parts of him. And maybe we can use that. Okay, don't... Don't look at me like that. - I'm not an idiot, you know that. - No. No. Look, um, you're in shock, it's understandable. It's... Fuck off. Hey, I'm not trying to dismiss you... I'm just going for a walk. - Hey! Wait! - See you later. It's not... It's not safe. Shit! - I need your motorcycle. - Fuck you, asshole. Rainer, where the fuck are you? You're in some deep shit. Listen... You got to go by my place. Daria Morris... Daria Morris is there. You get her out of there, okay? Don't... Don't take her by the precinct. There he is. Let's get this prick. - Who is it? - Daria, you've got to come with us. Rainer's orders. Jones, is that you? Jones? I don't know no Jones. This is Greyvenstein. Be right down. He's at the Quarry Road Tunnel. Headin' west, but he's got a huge lead. We lost him. We'll cut him off. Yee-haw! Jackpot! Shit! He's on my tail. We're coming around. Just keep him in your sight. Get ready, boys. He's coming your way. Almost there. Almost there. Oh, shit! He's headed toward the old quarry building. Greyvenstein, what am I doing in here? They got half a dozen witness saying that you were the driver of that Lazarus. Including a few cops. What? No, no, no, no. You and I both know that that's bullshit. Look, whoever you fucked with, he's connected. You can't just stand by and let these assholes set me up like this. Where's Daria? Greyvenstein, please. Where is Daria? He's headed toward the quarry building. Keep on its tail. Goddamn it! Don't let him get away. Hey, where are you guys taking me? That is a good question. Hey, you still want her at your place? Negative. Pull over and wait for further instructions. The Night will decide what to do with her. Roger that. Maybe we should put The Night in charge of everything. - Give me a reason. - Shit. Put your hands up. You don't want to do this. Get out of the car. I thought you said you'd pat her down. Get out. Keep your eyes open. He's around here somewhere. Fuck! - Fuck! - Okay, we've got him. We've got him. Find a way to get him into the quarry building. We're ready for him. Get on the ground. Did you see that? What the fuck? He's chasing the bitch in the police car. Well, Daria Morris. You never cease to impress. You've had a good run, but I think you'd better call it quits. Your friend in the Lazarus may be bulletproof, but you're not. He's not my friend. Then maybe you'd like to make a deal. Lead the car to me. If I help, will you call off your dogs? There's an old quarry off exit 29. Lead the car to that quarry and into the building. We have a plan all set. Deal. Shoot her! Waste that asshole! Where is he? There was never a driver. She set us up! What? No! No! We had a deal! We had a deal! Tear it apart! You have the chip, you don't need me. You really thought we'd let you go? Yeah, I guess not. Such spark in you. Not everyone deserves a quick death. What have we here? Holy shit! Nice to meet you at last, Daria. I hope you've had time to reflect on your situation. Fuck you! I hear you're angry. And I'm sorry about your little friend, Mila. She wasn't our intended target. Yeah? Well, I'm sorry for your "little friends", too. I had fun killing them. I know. You have a real darkness about you. Just kill me already. We've got enough corpses, don't you think? Running around up there, buying laundry soap, doing yoga. That could be you again. Assuming you'd want to go back. - Like you're giving me a choice. - Perhaps I am. I want the real Daria. The girl you were before the polish and the pearls. Were you ever really happy playing the good girl? Sometimes. Sometimes when I'd be in a room with all those rich, smart, smiling people... I felt that I belonged. And other times? Other times... I would think about how sweet it would feel to watch their guts spill out on the floor. Welcome to The Night. The Lazarus One. Car of the year. Of all the junk yards in all the world, you had to roll into mine. This isn't gonna be easy. And you ain't gonna be cute no more. But I got a surprise for you. Ain't no samurai heft a sword made of carbon-fucking-fiber can't chop you up. You're gonna need a donor car. I think it's pretty killer. Detective Rainer, this meeting has been called for your benefit. How long have you been on Talen's payroll? Huh? He put you through law school? Oh, you can have your honor and your day in court, and, in the unlikely event that anybody loves you, you can have a widow to inherit your pension when I execute you. Or, you can resign. And what about Daria? From what I understand, she already made her deal. So that settles it. - Okay. You win. - Hey, no. I got no right being a cop. Now, you want my badge, Yasha? You can have my badge. Where is he? - I don't know. - Where's Talen? You think he trusted me that much? I have no idea. - What was on that chip? - Accounting information. Payoffs. Talen has a vast network of businesses. - Like? - Strip clubs, brothels, half the Red Light District. It doesn't matter. Talen's out of sight, you'll never find him. Tell me! Fucking tell me! So where are your morals now, Detective? How long before they find you? You'll never make it out of the city alive. You just might be the baddest thing I ever saw. Only one way to find out. No! Miserable piece of... What was I thinking? Hallelujah! Holy shit! All right. All right. Okay. Okay, think. Think. Come on, you... Come on, asshole. Think. Okay, Talen. Talen. Underground. Underground. Underground. Nightclub. I do apologize for the shackles. It's not that I don't like you, it's just that I don't trust you quite yet. Yeah? Well, I don't trust you yet, either. That's good. Blind faith is for timorous. Now, for the main event. I've bought you a canvas. This one has failed me. Betrayed you. I can't think of a better way to celebrate. Use your imagination. Rainer, the force is coming, man. Hard. Tell them I'm gonna be at the Club Appolyon. Bring the big guns. Oh, Yasha, you little bitch. Don't. Don't. Please! Daria, they made me. I... Now this is what I need. You got a lighter? Lacking in subtlety, but the brutality itself is commendable. You're gonna burn, Yasha. Disappointing. Kill her. Finally! Better be right about this. Tell me where The Night is. You have one second. Whoa! Whoa! Move! Move! Boo! Oh, you're gonna pay. I'm gonna enjoy this. Talen was wrong about you. Oh, your personality is awful, but you're not lethal without that car. And you're not lethal without that arm. Step into the darkness! It's me. Nice to finally meet you. - Oh, damn. - Come on. Good luck. What're you doing? - The car. - Yeah, I believe you. We've got to stop it. No, no, no! Hey, hey, hey! What make you think you can stop it? What make you think this thing can even be stopped? I'm the one. He said it himself. He's not gonna stop until he gets me. Jesus Christ! You know how to drive one of those things? No, but how hard can it be? This ends now. What are you doing? Still hunting me? What for? You think you're gonna come back? Be the guy at the top? I hate to tell you this, but you lost, James. You lost everything. Well, you pulled it off. Mmm-hmm. Yeah. Are you sure you're all right? Mmm, yeah. Scars are sexy, right? - I probably should've listened to you about the car. - Yeah. I'm always right. Look, I don't know what happens next, maybe I got a job, maybe... not. But if you're free... and I'm not in jail... maybe we do dinner. Yeah. No! Shit! Damn you, James! Goddamn you! What do you want from me? Stop it! James, you don't own me anymore! You told me how to live, I'm not gonna let you tell me how to die! Where's that CPU? I'm done with all you fucking people! I got you, James. Subtitles by explosiveskull
