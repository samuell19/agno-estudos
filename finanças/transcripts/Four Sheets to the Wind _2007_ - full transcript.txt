And he came over to me and told me not to worry, that he knew a dance that was gonna protect US from the tornado. And he went out into the front yard, started dancing and singing and shit.

I thought he was it. It was at a party ... my first. [ Chuckles ] The girls and I, we snuck out of boarding school over to this birthday party in eufaula. He was slinking off in some corner, in the shadows. I did everything to get his attention. I kept staring at him. He never so much as looked at me. Finally, I got the nerve. I went up to him, and I said, "hey, capane. What's your name?" He looked at me out of the corner of his eye, said in that quiet voice of his, he said... "Four sheets to the wind." [ Chuckles ] I said, "what?" [ Laughs ] He said, "that's my name." [ Chuckles ] Those were his first words to me. Mom was so pissed when we got married.

Do you talk? -We talk, mom. -Just don't go letting it be a sex thing. You'll never make it. -[ Sighs ] Can I get some coffee? -Yeah. You know where it is. -[ Sighs ] [ Telephone ringing ] -Hi, this is miri. Leave a message. I'll call you back. [ Beep ] -Hey, miri. This is cuf. I'm just calling 'cause I haven't heard from you, and I didn't get to say goodbye, so... Yeah, I'm all right. I'm at home now. I'm gonna just be here with mom, so I guess just give me a call when you get this or you have some time. All right, I love you. [ Beep ] [ Click ] [ Beep ] [ Sighs ] -I had my prostate checked four times. Think I got some sort of std. Something just ain't right. -Man, you always think you have some kind of std. -Well, this time, it's real, though. -Just 'cause you're always around dead people, man. I don't know how you can do that. I'd start feeling like iwas dying, too. -Your mom tells me you've been hanging out with some chick. -Yeah, my mom talks too much. -Serious? -I don't know. -I just like hanging out with her, man. She's cool. -Coming from you, that sounds serious. You been sleeping? You need anything? -I've been sleeping better. -You taking something? -These sleeping pills that Charles prescribed me. I don't like them, though. I gave them to miri. -Should have gave them to me. -♪ My heart won't budge ♪ I start fallin' and sleepin' ♪ I fix my eyes and I'm breathin' ♪ ♪ makin' sure we're gone ♪ da da da da ♪ my heart won't budge ♪ like she's a bad addiction -miri? -[ Singing indistinctly ] ♪ Till my breath is gone ♪ but there's one less phone [ telephone rings ] ♪ Da da da da -hello?
