Palle... it's very important that you follow the steps of your spiritual progress. We... you and I... have a great mission. We shouldn't forget that. God... shall speak to us. Careful... my husband is a detective. We have to watch what we're doing. Strong kick. Wants out. What brings you here in the middle of the day? I had to question a witness down the street. Wanna help me with the boxes in the store room? I have to go now, but I can be back at five. Promises promises... I will. Hey... Fill it. Put your hands up. Come on. Stop the alarm. Don't move. Easy. I said... don't move. You! Fill the briefcase. I said... fill the briefcase. MOVE! Give me your bike. Don't... HEY... THAT'S MY BIKE! WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING? CRAZY! Don't follow me. Get down. Don't shoot. Close your eyes. Please. Do not follow me. Keep your eyes closed. THAT WAY! THAT WAY, STAIRWAY TO THE RIGHT! This way. Be careful. Nice work boss. Right place at the right time. I bet it's the same guy who robbed the bank last week. The sunglasses, the woolen cap the way he did it... it all adds up. But if he did the first robbery, where's the money he took? Thuesen. Yes, he's here. Anders Olsen. My wife Marie... She fell down a ladder. Please... - One moment please. Mr. Olsen. - How is she? She will be fine. - And the baby? Well... Can I get you anything? Nothing. Marie, I... - I know. Pardoned Nazi shoots bank manager and clerk Here you go. Local heroes. Local heroes nab killer, save lives, in bold action Not me... so much for my heroism. Why do they have to mention he was a Nazi? What difference does it make? He still shot two people. People are dying... just like that. Here. Thank you. Sorry, boss. Yeah! really sorry. Thank you. But please, business as usual, okay? What do we know about our bank robber? Palle Hardrup, 28 years old toolmaker, married, sentenced in 1946 to prison for war crimes being part of our local Gestapo, the HIPO. In that case, he also has friends in this building. Go on. Comes from a good family, modest means. He was paroled in 49 employed by an oil company in 1950. He was studying to be an engineer. Then at his trial in 46 he said that he was motivated solely by the desire to defend Denmark and secure its future. Is that why he robbed the bank to secure the future of Denmark? He claims that he did it so that he could create a better society one where everyone would live in psychic and psychologically balanced conditions. He wants to set up a Danish National Communist Party. A lunatic. Yeah. And the other bank, any clues where the money might be? No. He denies knowing anything about it. Alright. Let's go talk to his wife. I don't know anything about any money. Destroy everything if you want. You husband robbed two banks. He shot two people dead. This is serious. Could you open this door please? Hell's tears... Did your husband do all these drawings? Yes. He was studying engineering. Official Uniforms to the Soldiers of the New Nordic Spiritual Kingdom We married shortly after Palle was released from prison. Who are they? Friends of Palle from prison. I never liked them. He sketched everything... buildings parks, uniforms. The future. The new Nordic Spiritual Kingdom, a great spiritual, military and economic power OK so this guy is a complete nutcase, but damn he can draw. Did you discuss robbing the 'Lands' bank with anyone? No. And the other bank two weeks ago... was that you? I don't remember. Palle you weren't at work that day. Remember that? You've been in prison before, right? Right. You were sentenced in 1946 for collaborating with the enemy. National Socialism had a breath of the old Viking tradition in modern form. Only by going back to what we once were can we develop traditional harmony and power. The Nazis did evil things, we know that now, but... but what they wanted... was a strong society of equals. What do we have today? An indifferent society... without aims, without equals, without... So you shot two innocent people just so you could raise the money for your vision of equality. They didn't obey orders. If I hadn't shot them I would have betrayed God and his will and I would have been acting against society, and humanity and the guardian angel. Formed by the unity of its five nations, the Nordic monarchy would be a mighty force able to weather all storms and adversities. Its ultimate task would be to disseminate humanism throughout the world. He couldn't have done this alone. It's just... I just spoke with Hardrup's wife. So... now we have some information about the four riders of the apocalypse. Four nut cases of Northern Monarchy. They were all in prison at the same time: Palle, Mikael Jensen and Ole Mortensen. The fourth one she couldn't remember. Couldn't remember? She said he just showed up at the wedding uninvited. He's on the wedding photo? Don't know. Jensen moved to the America and Mortensen runs the club. The Pink Dragon. The Pink Dragon... that's a brothel. What? LOCK THE DOORS! STAIRWAY! He went over there! No, he's not here. - SHUT UP! GET UP! GET UP! NOW! - Don't shoot! I thought you were someone I owed money to. Didn't realize you were police officers. - No thank you. I have nothing but respect for the police. Do you know this man? Look... I had nothing to do with that bank job. I haven't seen Palle since that picture was taken. Did you know Hardrup before you met him in prison? No. We but we were in the same cell for a while. And the guy next to you? Bjørn Schouw Nielsen. The fucking pendulum. That's what they called him. He sold Jews for his freedom. Back in the war he had a fight with a German officer ended up shooting the guy over some girl. The Germans got hold of him and he asked them to take him to the Gestapo. Then he told them about these Jews trying to escape to Sweden. The Germans got all of them. Later, he betrayed the Germans too. There's no money here, but... there's a lot of other weird stuff. Keep looking. Anyway, Palle and Nielsen wanted me out of the cell. They both got into that... weird Eastern philosophy stuff. Spooky... you know. Palle changed. Totally. He was like... like a different person like... like someone in a daze. A daze? You know, like... what do they call it? A trance. Is it the bank robbery? Yes and somehow it gets under my skin. Are you spying on me? Maybe I ought to. I guess this did not turn out to be such a happy marriage. More on Nielsen. Age 14 thrown out by father. Age 16 first jail sentence. Assault, drunk, disorderly. He was a member of a psychological research society. The study of psychological and extra-sensory phenomena and hypnosis. Petersen... I want all the information you can find about this psychological research group and who led it... and find Nielsen. He's down here. Do you want to wait outside or talk to him now? Now. Mr. Nielsen. Breathe on it and you're a dead man. On second thoughts... You look familiar but you are not a regular? No. I know the papers! I've seen your picture. You're somebody famous... locally. You wouldn't refuse a drink, would you? Roland, give a round of beer for everybody. We would like to ask you a few questions... if you don't mind. Do you recognize this man? My old friend Palle, the bank robber. Do you still keep in touch? Now and then. He's been in pretty bad shape lately. Somebody really ought to take care of him. We have a warrant to search your home. Fanfare of the new Nordic Spiritual Kingdom Rules and regulations of Nordic Spiritual Kingdom There's no money. Is he the bank robber's partner? I don't know, perhaps. Maybe you could let me help you. My brain really needs something to do... What about the bookshop? and a way to forget. It's confidential. We started with breathing exercises and progressed to various yoga techniques such as Raja yoga, Hatha yoga, Bhakti yoga and finally Karma yoga. Our objective was divine, para-cosmic enlightenment in which yoga was a tool in the process of purification of the body and soul. Our? Mine and Schouw Nielsen's. Can I help you? Yes. I'm looking for your section on Eastern philosophy. Right this way. Here we are. Interesting to meet someone who cares about Eastern philosophy, it's not so usual. Does this interest you as well? Four years of philosophy studies behind me. Only a few courses away from my degree. Wonderful! It seems we have much to share with each other. Can we get him to give us any real answers? Schizophrenic deterioration produces para-cosmic delusions in him. In his state of mind, I really doubt it. What about the yoga and his mental practice with Nielsen? Mortensen said that Hardrup was in some kind of trance. Could he have been under hypnosis when he carried out the robberies? Neither forensics nor medical science has recognized that a crime can be committed under the effect of hypnosis and that the process can be forgotten. It's impossible. Did you really talk to Nielsen? He was... I don't know... fascinating. It's really hard to believe he's part of the crime. He's a former Nazi. He had this strange connection with Hardrup in prison where they would practice yoga and meditation. Normally those things have a positive effect on the mind. He's dangerous. I might be able to get something out of him. I think you should stay away from him from now on. What if he knows who you are? Maybe he does! Warsaw University Doctor of Psychiatry You saw his smile? He is freed from his fear of death which prevented him from sleeping. I needed to treat this patient through his past life. Do you believe in past lives? Young man... I don't believe in anything. I use whatever works. There is no point in solving philosophical and religious problems when someone's well-being is at stake. Do you always overwhelm strangers with information about your patients? Only those police who seek enlightenment about the mysteries of manipulation. So, what is troubling you? Would you like to take a seat? No this is not about me. You never know. I'm here because of work, not to be hypnotized. Could you please tell me about your psychological research group? What was its purpose? To create new viewpoints to people. We also did some experiments related to meditation, hypnosis and out-of-body experience. Do you remember this person from your group? Yes I do. He was very eager to learn everything. Aboriginal people use trances, which are a kind of... stage of hypnosis. For them it is connected to healing and seeing deeper. It is said that thousands of years ago certain tribes performed complicated brain surgery using hypnosis. Miracle, isn't it? It's generally accepted that no one acts contrary to their own moral codes... even under hypnosis. So you're saying you cannot hypnotize a person to commit robbery or to kill? I didn't say that. People often act in the name of religion, belief, patriotism. We were taught these values from the time we were children. That is also hypnosis, inspector. For some people's morale codes can be exploited, circumvented. Immoral things become moral. That's what many leaders do... use idealistic goals to get people to act on their most basic habits. Let's see how it goes. He's agreed to cooperate. Doctor Dabrowski. Palle Hardrup. We are now moving back through time. Until the time when you were in 'Horsens' prison after the war. Back to your cell. You are now in that time... in that moment. Breathe slowly... in and out. Tell me where are you now... and what year is it? In prison... in my cell... it's 1947. Is there anyone else in your cell? No... I'm alone at the moment. How do you feel? Good... comfortable. Do you have any plans for when you leave prison? I have a great mission. Tell me about this mission. Does this mission have anything with to do the new party? Yes but I'm not allowed to talk about it the guardian angel forbids it. The guardian angel? Yes, he forbids it. You want to tell me about it... now. I can't. I can't. You can Palle you are at complete liberty to talk about it you have permission. What does he look like? NO, I can't... He protects me. He protects me. I can't. I must... I must go away. We're coming back from there, from that time, from that moment. You can feel yourself... your mind relaxing. We are returning to the present now... till this moment. It seems there is a lock in Hardrup's mind that I can not break. What do you mean 'a lock'? Someone has placed a block there and it's linked to a person or a code. The guardian angel? Hardrup's mind will only accept a certain user and the code is there to maintain the effect, the suggestion. A code? Yes. It could be a sign, a memory, a voice something which maintains the state of trance. You think he's being manipulated? Hypnotized? Apparently, yes. Can we find another way to break this lock? Are you asking me to help you solve this case? I get to use the material for my personal research. I'm allowed to film the experiments. You get to manipulate and use me if you let me do the same to you. Ah! Max Dabrowski, the Great Bonzini. and the infamous police interrogator. I hear you graduated to selling popcorn. Yes, would you want to try some? Psychology put into practice. Taste the way of life of Hollywood. Too salty. Your henchmen dragged me down here away from one of my customers. Is it your intention to destroy my honorable business? Do you know what this is? Are you joking? It's a popular model. Had one myself just like it. It was stolen. I reported it to the police. It is your bicycle. We found it close to the bank Palle Hardrup robbed. I'm surprised he would take it from me. It is a shame... to be betrayed by a friend. What are you doing? It's just for my own collection. You and Hardrup were in the same cell in prison, right? Yes. Says in the report you two practiced yoga there. We did whatever we could to endure the difficult circumstances. OK! What is the New Nordic Kingdom? Because we found material relating to that in both your houses. Those were Hardrup's strange imaginations, not mine. But I must say those thoughts did seem to keep him stable in prison. We also used other forms of spiritual evolution together. What about hypnosis? Did you ever use that in your spiritual evolution? Not as such, but... whichever method he's chosen one must be careful. Balance is essential to personal development. Is your history of assault also essential to your personal development? Lambs sometimes stray from the fold but even those who stray have the right to seek the light of love. Lock him up. And... here is Dabrowski's book. Thank you. Does he suspect somebody used hypnosis in the bank robbery? Maybe. Who... Nielsen? Yes. Nobody's ever carried away a crime like that. We don't know that, can't know. But how pure are Dabrowski's motives? Maybe he's wants to make history try to prove something that nobody can understand. I read that he used to be an old stage hypnotist. You should consider... - Marie, please. See you at home. Two... three... four... and you are completely relaxed... peaceful. Five... you're falling deeper into dream. Ten. You're back in prison in 1947. You can see the place and also who are around of you and you will see and hear how the guardian angel will talk to you. You will see and hear him now. We still have some unanswered questions that's why I invited Doctor Dabrowski. And your... mumbo jumbo tests can answer these questions? Yes. Someone has put a lock into Hardrup's mind. A lock? And is the only unanswered question is where is the money otherwise the case is clear. You have nothing on Nielsen so release him. You can collect your clothing and personal belongings on your way out. You're free to go. I know you're behind this... and I am going to prove it. You and your great Bonzini can't prove a damn thing. You are... a chicken and you want to talk to your friends. You are in a deep, deep trance. You have... a fever. You're hot. You have to get get rid of your feathers. Glad to see that everyone is working hard. Anders we were... just... OK. Sorry. We're continuing with the Nielsen lead no matter how funny you all find it. Boss we still haven't got any solid evidence. You sound like Thuesen. We'll find evidence and we'll show it to him. That's our job. So this one interests you. Thank you. My friend has committed a horrible crime. The police think that I'm involved in this crime which is linked to hypnosis So it will be a good time to learn more to understand what the police are trying to prove. Four kroner. But you know about this through your husband Something... but did you do it? Some people have a natural calling for evil. Hardrup has gone the wrong direction. I blame myself. I wasn't there to rescue him. In hypnosis you can set locks in the mind to make a person think in only one zone or, you can open new connections remove blocks and frustrations. Right here. It's all a question of skill and responsibility. A tool for good... or evil! In Poland, I used to help my friend who was a police officer. Through hypnosis, we could get witnesses to return to the scene of the crime in their minds and remember insignificant details more clearly. They were able to stop their memories in a precise given moment and identify the guilty one. It worked well, but then, one witness faked his trance and named an innocent person in order to protect the real criminal. You lost your reputation then? I fucked up! because of one little detail all our research was turned into a farce. Your father was a police officer? Yes... and a friend of Thuesen. Is there something you want to talk about regarding your father? Let's not talk about my nightmares. Palle... the guardian angel wishes to speak to you. He will use this body to transform his speech. You are chosen as the founder of the Northern Monarchy the herald and vanguard for all spiritual thinking. You will become a great leader with an important mission which Bjørn Schouw Nielsen will also uphold. All of your failings are erased. You are under God's wing now. I saw you were awake. Mind if we talk? No. You know... I have trouble sleeping too. It's no wonder. Our unbalanced world can affect us in many... disturbing ways. but when the mind... is purified... and you stand... at the foot of the holy mountain you can feel the breath of divinity fall on you and all else loses its meaning. They tried to scare me... about Schouw Nielsen. They wondered about our friendship... but we were the only ones who sought the truth within ourselves. Why didn't you shoot me? You obeyed the orders. You did not step up against the guardian angel's and God's will. You obeyed. Who is the guardian angel? He's a messenger from God. Is he here? Does he protect you? The guardian angel protects my family, yes. Sorry. I have to go. Will you be home for dinner? Things are rather busy at work. By the way... Nielsen came by the bookshop again. What? We had a right interesting talk. He knows I'm your wife. This is crazy! He's manipulating you. Maybe... or then there's the other possibility that he's innocent. You mustn’t talk to him. We talk to our customers. Should I just turn my back on him? I shouldn't have told you anything! I'm an idiot! You're not to see him! Here's the list of all the people who came to visit Hardrup. It's only two names on it that's Nielsen and Hardrup's wife Bente and she only visited him once. There's also several letters from Nielsen OK! But it doesn't prove anything. I want to see those letters. We searched the cell, didn't find anything. Logical. He destroys them. From now on, all letters to Hardrup pass through us. Right. Coffee and pastries. Susi used to work for the signal corps in Sweden during the war. Terrific! Back to the typewriter. Are you going into a trance again? Almost. Just keep your trousers on, ok? Why not put Nielsen and Hardrup in the same room together question them and see what happens? Excellent. I want to film it. I made all the mistakes. I stole... even killed a German soldier. But the hardest part for me is getting past how I betrayed my Jewish friends. I was lucky. No one betrayed us we were able to avoid the camps and my family got here safely after the war. I don't know if it was my evil nature or the sum total of my childhood traumas but all this self-improvement like yoga and meditation has helped bring me closer to my inner light. This hasn't been the most balanced time for me. My emotions go up and down. You know we... we just had a tragedy... we lost our child. I am so sorry to hear that. So... no smoking... what about alcohol? Alcohol? Are you balanced with that? That part could still use some development. Oh! Sometimes a glass of wine can clarify the mind. In the middle of the day? - Especially in the middle of the day. Shall we? Why not! The food is getting cold. Have you been waiting for me? It looks very nice. I'm so sorry that we had such a bad start this morning. It's OK. Have you been drinking? With my colleagues after work. A glass of wine. Also I met my... professor. We talked about my graduation. - Over wine? Just one glass. Cheers. Good afternoon, Palle. - Good afternoon. What did you do with the money from the first bank you robbed? Palle, did it ever occur to you that your friend Bjorn was using hypnosis on you while you were together in prison? Sorry for the interruption. Hardrup has already confessed and he said he did it alone. Why can't you trust me? What are you scared of? Why don't you see it yourself you are being manipulated by this Polish... Polish what? Say it! I'm not hunting you and nazis anymore! Anders I'm concerned about your fucking health! Sorry. I know you've had people watching me. Including Petersen. Four days. Max. Wrap this up then the case is closed. The law allows me to hold you for questioning for as long as the investigation continues. It continues until you talk. Long day, huh? One drink, for the road? Why not! but this time... at my place. HAPPY BIRTHDAY! Wow! Do you want some cake? Yes please. So you didn't invite Thuesen? He's not a friend of mine either. You know I respect you more than any other police investigator but in this case, whether you are right or wrong... this will never succeed in court. Hypnosis, Anders... Dabrowski! it's too weird. I'm telling you this as a friend. Thank you for the birthday. You know lack of evidence isn't the problem. There are plenty of officers who create the evidence they need when they know someone is guilty. Mrs. Hardrup. I see I came at a busy time. Are you moving far? Near here about half the size. Would you mind answering just a few questions? I knew Nielsen before I met Palle. It was his idea that Palle and I should meet when Palle got out of prison... and get married. I know it sounds crazy but I got to love Palle more and more with each day. He's a good man... not mentally ill, as Nielsen says. Nielsen controlled the people around Palle. I hated it, but Palle insisted he and Nielsen were bound by a common spiritual course shit. Schouw Nielsen never had a spiritual thought in his head... never. The thing is... Nielsen also wanted to have me. He raped me. I resisted and I missed five weeks of work recovering from broken bones... and what did Palle do? He approved of what Nielsen did because it was a part of his spiritual development. Palle had to learn to give up worldly matters everything he was attached to, in order to get to a higher spiritual level. I have two witnesses who will testify that you successfully hypnotized Hardrup while you both were in prison and that you raped his wife to gain control over his mind. That's more than enough for the public prosecutor to start an official inquiry. The noose is tightening around your neck. And... if I tell you what you want to know, what do I get out of it? Your cooperation will be taken into account when the court sentences you. OK! so here's the deal. I want a decent meal and an intimate, pleasurable half-an-hour with some charming young lady then I will tell you whatever you want to know, including how I manipulated Hardrup. You're crazy. I don't think its an unreasonable request under the circumstances. I would like her to be blond, and not taller than 170 centimeters and as young as possible. I can't do that. Whistling I'm impressed. Wait here. But where's the girl? Hi Bjørn. Nina. A good choice, Mr. Olsen. First the confession, then the fun. This isn't the Catholic Church. And... with the use of hypnosis, I got Palle Hardrup to rob two banks. And? That's it. This just gets better and better. Let's keep it decent, OK? That... I cannot promise. Time's nearly up. Time's up! That... was something. From time to time your wife came into my mind. She is a very attractive woman. Hasn't she told you about our conversations when we have good food and wine? When will this dirty dog be on the streets again? With his written confession he will be given a shorter sentence. What written confession? Very funny... come on. This? This is not my signature this is a vulgar forgery. Obviously it is written right-handed. I'm left-handed. You said so yourself. Police officers often fake evidence. You fucking bastard! He got me drunk. He... he tried to bribe me in every conceivable way. What has happened? I had to release Nielsen. He tricked me. Tricked? Yeah. He said he was guilty but then he took his words back, so... But you couldn't keep him? I know you've been lying and continuing meeting with Nielsen so... if you want to help me... keep meeting him... try to get some evidence, try talking to him. Whatever you can find... No, I don't want to. You have to help me. I don't know what else to do. You want to help me, right? And through the use of psychic manipulation and hypnosis I convinced Palle Hardrup that had a divine mission to perform For the hypnosis I used the code "Robin Hood". God damn it, Anders! How did you allow yourself to be conned into this? Liquor, whores, violence! I've had to write Nielsen an official apology. Nielsen has promised not to go to the press or file a complaint as long as you stay away from him. Jørgensen's psychiatric report will recommend that Hardrup be committed to a mental hospital... that is the end of the case for us. I suspect the prosecutor and defense will want all the evidence at their disposal. Anders... you are hurting yourself now... but bring him back one last time... the Great Polish Bonzini. The problem is that the more we try to hypnotize Hardrup the more difficult it becomes. He just experiences more physical pain. He claims hypnosis doesn't work on him. yet he is very susceptible to posthypnotic suggestion. Even though he was in a very light trance Hardrup followed my suggestion that the food was poisoned. and that he should destroy it so that nobody would be harmed by it. I believe Nielsen used the spiritual experiences they shared together to gain Hardrup's confidence then he used Hardrup's own religious political and revolutionary ideas as the material for his hypnosis. We all know that Hardrup is schizophrenic. No he's not. He is an idealist who became putty in Nielsen's hands. But there is still no evidence of manipulation. Precisely. We need facts, not 'Robin Hood' magic tricks. I want Nielsen followed every minute, every second, everywhere he goes. Shouldn't we leave Nielsen alone, those were Thuesen's orders. David! Do you want to report to Thuesen or to me? Pick your side. I report to you. Good. It has been quite a while. As you can see, the head of police finally recognized that your husband had been trying to prosecute me. I've been worried about Anders... slightly his whole state of mind has been changing. The long-term impact of early trauma... just lash out and find an outer target for his inner furies. Maybe... if you can find more within yourself and transfer that feeling to him it might start to heal him and his energy. You mean like em... using meditation or yoga? For instance, guided meditation could start the process. I could help, if you want. Uniforms Architecture The Guardian Angel Well... it seems congratulations are in order... you are pregnant. Beautiful. Skilled suggestion, huh? Letters from Nielsen to Hardrup. Some are happy to surrender their fate to the church or the state. Please forget about the sermon, Max. Someday we'll invent a machine that sends electric signals to the brain and controls it. Take a look at the letters can't make any sense out of them. The first letter says: Greetings, my friend... summer approaches, nature blossoms and the air gets warmer. The other one... it's just as meaningless. One thing puzzles me... both of the letters are signed your friend... Bjørn Schouw Nielsen XXX and they look like swastikas. I know they're not but... it was just an idea. Anders! you might be a genius. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. How is it going? I'm not complaining. Once you've found your balance you can be content anywhere. Can I see that book? Anders... look at this. Stop! It is one of the most widely used signs for post-suggestion. Whenever Hardrup sees an X the suggestion implanted by Nielsen is preserved. Your telephone messages... Not now. The last one is from your wife. Boss - What? Just spoke to surveillance... Marie's just had a long meeting with Nielsen. Hardrup has to be completely isolated from any X signs. Put him in a new cell check it three times a day. If he makes any X signs, paint it over immediately. All his reading material... confiscate it. I have to tell you something. I know about Nielsen. Did he tell you anything? No. It's... it's something else. So no new clues? No. What do want to say? Maybe it's not all that important. Marie, I have to go. Bye. I have a great mission ♪ Fighters fought with fighters ♪ ♪ Reap the fields of pain ♪ ♪ Brother fighting brother ♪ ♪ Echoes now... again ♪ ♪ You will give your pledge ♪ ♪ Raise your sword in hand ♪ ♪ Justice is your promise ♪ ♪ You'll take your stand ♪ Whenever you see this sign you will know that God speaks through this body. I am your guardian angel. There is nothing physically wrong with him. He seems to be going through withdrawal. Like an addict. Of course I'd... need to do further tests. Is everything alright? Palle? I know you've separated me from him... from God. We're just trying to bring the right man to justice. Justice? When the Nazis lost do you remember what you did in the name of justice? Any girl who'd slept with a German, had her head shaved her clothes were torn from her body and she was made to run naked through the streets. When the people executed all those whose only crime was that they had defended their country was that justice? Where were the police then? Hm! YOU'VE DESTROYED EVERYTHING! FORT! BRING THE DOCTOR. FORT... THIS WAY. Oh no! Oh no no no! Are you OK? Yes better than our friend here. He's totally disrupted. He's been separated from divinity that's all his brain keeps telling him. I don't know. There is a risk we might kill him. Maybe we should return him to the X's? No. Anders, this is too much. You're off the case as of now, it's over. The department will conduct an official investigation into your actions. What happened to the Great Bonzini? I questioned my responsibility and buried him. A young woman I had invited to come see the Great Bonzini awoke me. The look she gave me that... how I use my skills. It hurt. I would have married her you know. She saw through the whole show... and me. You lost your child. You know better than me what it means to lose someone. Did the same happen with your father? Yes, but... eh... You want to talk? Look into my eyes and take a deep breath. Is this a joke? No. Look into my eyes. OK... let's play your game. Breathe slowly. Very slowly. In and out. Yes. You became a police officer like your father. Yes. We were both stationed in the same SA unit during the war. Spying for the Nazis. Just keep looking at my eyes. So, what happened? It felt wrong... so I ran away... all the way to London where I... I started working as a police specialist for the allies fighting against the Nazis. Against your father? Yes. And you won the war. No. I couldn't win. Many of our colleagues were in the SA too like Thuesen. I wanted to bring them to justice and have them tried in court but too many people were against me. And you wanted to punish them? Take revenge. My father died in a car accident when the Germans lost the war. I returned home the day after. I don't know if he did it on purpose. You could not make up with your father... so you punished yourself. I'll never get to understand why why he chose to be a part of them... why he became a part of the Nazis. Everyone can be manipulated. Cry... good, that's good. It will be fine. It will be OK. Your wife Marie... she called me. She's been worried about you. Me too. We're trying to help you. Dabrowski. One moment please. For you. The nurse from hospital. Yes? Thank you. Hardrup's getting worse. We should break the lock now. Welcome my dear. Thanks so much for helping me. Come. The doctor should be here soon. Maybe you should go and get him. Sorry? Just go. GO! I can understand why so many writers were captured by the magic of the East. There's so much to discover. Yes. Their way of thinking, their techniques for self-improvement all of which can help set you free of that stone of grief you're hiding inside your soul Marie. Marie... don't let that knowledge... even if it is good knowledge allow you to hide your secret pain. Bring it out. I can help you. I need help. I need something. Listen... I can't do it. This is not right. We don't have any choices. Alright. No, no. Stop. Take a deep breath. Take a deep breath, I say. Yes... slowly. Breathe slowly... in and out. Can he hear you? Yes, at some level. He is sensitive to suggestions too. Concentrate again... completely on my voice. Concentrate on my voice... as you feel all the sounds around you... begin to fade away... to silence... holding no meaning whatsoever. Breathe... in and out. You hear the voice of the guardian angel... and now you can see and understand... where that voice comes from. I am going to begin to count down... from ten and when I reach one you will follow my instructions very carefully. Is it here? - Yes Let's get him back to the X's! - Keep going! KEEP GOING! It's Doctor Gammeltoft. Please open the door. Ten. Nine. You'll feel yourself relaxing... more and more. Eight. You feel a touch of divinity within your soul. Seven. You must liberate yourself from things binding you to earth. Six. You must kill the feelings of false attachment to acquire true freedom and release your divine powers. Five. That is why you must kill, in your mind, the people closest to you. Four. Including your own mother again and again. until you no longer feel any attachment that stands in the way of your great mission. Three. You are free from the X's. I am your guardian angel. Two. You are free, Palle. Open the door! We're calling the guards! One. The lock is broken. You are awake. How do you feel? Good? Open the door or we break it. - You are good now. Sorry. The door was stuck. I'm not mad. I want a pen and paper. He made me kill my own mother... in my mind... again and again. I can't believe it. He broke through. Anders! Marie... She's in Nielsen's house. Did anyone go inside? No, I... I have to report this to Thuesen, but I wanted to let you know first. - Wait! Let's go! Take it, take it, take it, take it! There's a young lady with him. - I know. Wait here! Marie! It took quite a while for you to come. Where is she? Now now. She's perfectly safe. Marie? She is resting comfortably. Specifically until you sign a confession admitting that you tried to frame me that I am perfectly innocent. It's over. Hardrup told us everything. About how I hypnotized him... how I coerced him into robbing those banks killing those people. So you admit it? Of course, but I don't think you are going to do anything with that information, are you? Not after the inspector got me drunk, beat me up and coerced a confession from me. I've put a suggestion inside your wife's brain that she will remain relaxed until I give her a code word and that code word will remain unspoken until you cooperate with me. It's quite funny actually. Is it? The only reason she was open to suggestion was because of you. You weren't very attentive to her problems, were you? Was that very wise? I enjoyed it. That's impossible. Quite simple actually. You're not the only one who can put locks into people's heads you know. Before Marie came to see Nielsen she was kind enough to allow me put a suggestion into her head that would block him out. Maybe you should have listened to my lectures a little more carefully. Take him away. Let's go. I'm so sorry. How's Thuesen? Ashamed. Schouw Nielsen: Life imprisonment. Palle Hardrup: Psychopath custody. I told you I will get you. And you don't think I've got you?
