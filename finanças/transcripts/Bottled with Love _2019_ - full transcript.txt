I used to wear them to church. I can see that. - Hello. - Hi. Oh, how I love a wedding. Mary Abigail, I can't believe you brought work with you to a wedding. I didn't. I just like to be prepared so I... It doesn't matter. Listen, I told Scott that I would meet him out here so let's get you seated. Hi, I'm Abbey and this is my aunt, Francis. Nice to meet you. And there's gonna be three of us on the groom's side so if you could just get her seated somewhere on an aisle, maybe like four to six rows from the front. And not behind someone with a big hat. See ya in there. Sorry. A toast! My wish is for each one of you to find the love and happiness that we found today. A toast to love. To love! Wherever you are. Don't look at me like that. Well, it's his loss. Yeah, that's what everybody says, but I'm the common denominator in all of these break-ups. I'm the one that's too cold and too closed off and too judgmental. Or too critical of herself. Yes. Thank you. You can add that to the list. That's not what I mean. I mean you've always been so hard on yourself. I mean, have you ever looked in the mirror and say, "Hey Abby, you're great"? No. Well, you should. In fact, I think you should do what your father always did when he was feeling discouraged. What? When he and I were kids he got into the habit of writing himself pep talk letters. My dad? Yeah. Pep talk letters. Letters listing all the things that he liked about himself. Things that he knew the right person would appreciate about him when he fell in love. My dad did this? Yep. You seem surprised. I am. He doesn't seem like the romantic type. Do you have paper in that office you brought? Yeah. Yes. Yeah, why? Well, just give it to me. I want you to write a letter. Open up your heart, just be vulnerable. Don't be nervous about it, it's just you and a piece of paper. Just don't think about it. I don't... I... no. Just don't think about it, just write to the universe, or to your love who is out there somewhere. Just write about your passions. Your dreams. Who you are. Who you want. Just let it all pour out. And then I want you to take that letter and I want you to put it in this bottle and then I want you to throw that bottle out in the water. Yeah. I want you to throw your whole heart out into the world. I mean, it's symbolic but it'll be very, very good for you. Very good. Dear love, somewhere out there... This is so silly. Do you ever feel unknown? Like everyone has already labelled you and filed you away as complete without giving you the chance to learn and grow? I have a big heart. I feel so much, but I've never known how to show it. I'm loyal and trustworthy. I have a deep conscience. I stole a pack of gum once in the second grade and I couldn't sleep for a week. I'm a good listener, I'm great at my job, and I love pancakes. Pancakes will make me happy any time. But mostly, I want something real. I have the depth to walk through real life struggle and come out the other side and I'm looking for someone like that, too. Flawed, but open. Impossible to label and file away. I think we all deserve that, don't we? I'm willing to take the risk. Come find me. This is ridiculous. Technically, I'm about to pollute. Morning. Abbey! Abbey! - Hi. - Hi. Supposedly, Everson's going public. Really? Yeah. So now is your chance to impress Mr. Everson and get that big promotion. Yeah. Abbey hi. Hi. Elaine mentioned you went to a wedding at the Rowing Club on the weekend and we would love your thoughts, please. There was a mix-up at our original venue and we need to find a replacement as soon as possible. Yeah, sure. OK, let's see, Rowing Club. Food was spectacular, views were amazing. The staff was well-trained, everything seemed really organized. Decor was amazing. I think it gets a big thumbs up, Sophie. Fantastic. I'm going to call them. Yeah, sure. See you. So? So. So, how'd it go, introducing Scott to your Aunt Francis? It didn't. He broke up with me instead. What? Yeah, I was a mess for the whole wedding. And somehow my Aunt Francis convinced me to write a letter to love. And then, put it into a bottle. I threw it out to sea. I'm sorry, just give me... just give me a minute to wrap my head around that. I blame the whole thing on Aunt Francis. And champagne. But I have to say... you know me, I mean, I don't, like, open up a lot... Ever. I mean, a lot. Right, yeah. It did feel really good to be that open. Sounds like you had a few things bottled up there. Oh, geez. Well, it's all out there now. In the bottom of Boston Harbor. Where it shall remain. I've made a ranking of all our possible acquisitions. The green tab is all the players and breakdowns. Nice work, Abbey. Thank you. The blue tab is the schedule of all the meetings. - So... - OK. Did we just say "meetings"? I'm giving Abbey the job of adding another money maker to our portfolio before we go public. Fine, but you are under strict orders from your doctor to cut your schedule in half. I'm sorry, Abbey. I know it would be helpful to have dad with you in some of those meetings but he just can't do it. Sophie's right. I understand. I would go with you, but between two product launches and the wedding I'm so slammed. No, don't worry about it. You know, I know we don't have a lot of time but we have some great companies lined up. I can do this. Thanks, Abbey. I gotta take a look at that schedule, see what I can make. I would love that. It always helps to have an Everson in the room. You know, that Abbey really is impressive. I agree. She's structured, focused. Would be a good influence on your son. He's floundering, he is not focused. Is it wrong for me to want him to have some stability? Some roots? Of course not. But that would involve getting him back here. He worked here for two years, he did a terrific job, then one day I get a postcard from a salmon boat in Alaska. He said he couldn't work in an office anymore. It wasn't him. Dad, you can't exactly fault him. He makes his own money, he sublets his place when he's out of town, and he has never once asked you for a single thing. He's not in his '20's anymore. I was hoping he'd get whatever it was out of his system by now. Dad, I can't make a single one of these meetings. It would be nice to have Nick back. You know, maybe there is a way we can get him back here. He'd never go for it. Every time I broach the subject he bristles. Yes, but that is always you wanting him back here full time, which is this big, daunting commitment. What if it was just something for the short term? Something just so he can get his foot back in the door? See if he might like it again? Imagine that. Who pollutes nowadays? Soph. How're ya doing? Well, if you walked into my office right now you would think I was a wedding planner not an executive VP at Everson. But aside from that I am great. Kevin and I are really excited about the wedding and I just emailed you the schedule, but I'd sure love to see you before then. I'll be there for the wedding and everything related. I wouldn't miss it for the world. So dad's about to call and ask you something and I want you to say "yes". I'm invoking full bridal privilege. As long as it has nothing to do with me coming back there to work. I already had that argument with him enough times, I'm not having it again. It's not what you think. It's just a short-term project. No strings attached. Yeah, somehow I doubt that. The company's going public and dad wants to make a big splash. That sounds like dad. Well, he's gotten it in his head to add this new acquisition to the portfolio and it would really help to have an extra Everson around helping out. - Soph... - Nick, you know the business. And it would give you a chance to get to know Kevin better. OK, alright. I guess I'm coming back to Boston. This is gonna be so great! And it's just until the wedding. Alright. OK. Well... I love you. I love you, too. OK. Dad. Nick. Hey. How are ya? Great. Here we go again. Sue, can you tell Nick we're waiting for him? Yes sir. Yeah, yeah great seeing you, as well. We'll continue it in a minute. - Hey, guys. - Morning Nick. Coffee upgrade, huh? Look at that. There he is. There he is. How're you doing, Nick? - Good to see you, dad. - You too. Yeah. Hi. Abbey Lawrence. - Hi, Abbey. - Hi. Nick. Everson. You're late, Nick. Yeah. Dad, you had no coffee mugs. All I could find was this. It looks like a preschooler's art project. That pottery class was a gift from my Secret Santa. Keep working on it. I've asked Nick here to come and help you with the acquisition. Help-help-help me-help-help-how? With so much work tied up in this and me being less available, plus wasn't it you who said it can never hurt to have an Everson in the room? You said that? I did say that. I did say that. So what company did you come from? I... I was in Brazil, Alaska, Peru... Is there a particular acquisitions company that you worked for, or...? Tuna Trawler? Yes, that should be very helpful. Nick, Abbey is our top analyst in acquisitions. Our ace. She has incredible taste, laser focused. I think you can learn a lot from her. I think this is really gonna work. I don't get it. I don't need help. When was the last time I asked for help on anything? That would be never, sweetheart. Yeah, exactly. And when I said it would be nice to have an Everson in the room I meant Mr. Everson, or Sophie. Nick is the one that you never see. He's the Everson that you hear about never showing up for holidays. He's not even gonna take this seriously. Maybe he'll surprise you. No, he's gonna slow me down. Like it or not, it looks like you're gonna have to try to make the best of this, Mary Abigail. I hate when you call me that. Sorry. You're right. I mean, I have a promotion coming up, I have to find a way to make it work. I'm gonna set the tone right away. Dear Nick, attached you'll find the research files concerning our meeting tomorrow with Kat and Charlie of Kat and Charlie's Ice Cream. Please read all files. Look at this. It's my newest beer creation. Ranking out of five or ten? Ten. Come on. OK. This is the best yet. This is an eight and a half, for sure. Ooh. I think I'm gonna retire. Yeah, you could do that. Yeah. And move home. Make beer. That's a... that's a... that's a great idea. Oh yeah. Very great idea. Hey, listen. So... Abbey Lawrence. I don't think she's exactly thrilled about me being here. How well do you know her? Very well. She's great. OK, well you know that I'm pretty good at reading people, and I think that I know exactly who she is. Controlling, and a nitpicker. What does that make me then? OK, she is a professional and she is smart and we are very lucky to have her. OK. You're entitled to your own opinion. Oh, look at this. This is her right here. "Dear Nick, attached you'll find the research... " Sending me a ridiculous amount of files. If we're to work together I expect you to be fully prepared and up to speed. "I expect you"? What am I, 12? - Nick, give her a chance, OK? - Sophie... Dad is thrilled you're here and I think this is gonna be good for you. Soph, I hate to say this but when we're through I'm going back. Well, brother, I'm just glad you're here. Even if it's for a little while. Cheers. - It's good to see you. - It's good to see you. How'd you get in there? Dear love, somewhere out there. Do you ever feel unknown, like everyone has already labelled you and filed you away as complete without giving you the chance to learn and grow? I have a big heart. I feel so much, but I've never known how to show it so it always seems like I don't have a voice, like I'm not here. But I am here. I'm loyal and trustworthy, I have a deep conscience. I stole a pack of gum once in the second grade and I couldn't sleep for a week. I'm a good listener, I'm great at my job, I do a mean impersonation of a trumpet and I love pancakes. Like, pancakes will make me happy any time. Yes, I want all the romance of travel and stargazing, night swimming. That's nice. I have the depth to walk through real life struggle and come out the other side and I'm looking for someone like that, too. Flawed, but open. Impossible to label and file away. I'm willing to take the risk. Come find me. Beantown? She's here? In Boston? He just couldn't tell a good joke. Like he always missed the punchline? Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. It's probably Nick Everson complaining about the amount of work I sent him. Reeltraveler, your message in a bottle. Oh no! Someone found my letter. A complete stranger found my message in a bottle and just emailed me. What? You. You started this. Well, just don't stand there. This is exciting. Open it. - Read it to me. - OK, OK, OK, OK. Dear ML Beantown, I'm writing to tell you that I found your message in a bottle. You put your heart into this letter and I wanted you to know that both the letter and the sentiments inside are safe with me. Well, that's not so bad. That's kinda nice. If you're interested in exchanging a bottle for the far more conventional method of an online chat, I'm here and intrigued. This is exciting! What're you waiting for? Write him back. Write him back. Yes. I'm not gonna write... that could be any... no, I'm not gonna write anything. That could be anybody. Yes, it could, but it also could be a somebody. And I'm gonna leave you to it. Dear Reeltraveler, thank you for letting me know that my letter is safe. I'm a bit embarrassed, I have to tell you the letter was written after a weak moment at a wedding. Nothing to be embarrassed about, I've had one or two of those myself. Wait, I'm the guy. I'm supposed to be tough. Was I supposed to admit that? OK. You're a guy. Noted. I found your openness refreshing. That's nice of you to say. It would have been easy to be judgemental or critical, there's a lot of people out there like that. You can say that again. ML Beantown, can I go ahead and ask, have you found someone yet? What do you mean, you didn't write him back? It's a very personal question. The man already knows your most personal thoughts because you put them into a bottle and threw them into the sea. I know, I know. But, you know, statistically this is a person who found a bottle, so it's probably just like a 90 year old ex-convict from Poughkeepsie. Forget statistics. Something exciting just happened to you. Somebody found your message and contacted you. Please don't shut it down. Just play it out. OK, alright, I will write him back. You just made some 90 year old ex-convict in Poughkeepsie very happy. I love this side of you. Hey. Hi. - Hi. - Hey. We're supposed to be at Kat and Charlie's in 30 minutes. I'm kinda surprised I have to come remind you. You didn't. I told you the meeting was an hour earlier than it is because you were late yesterday and I didn't want to take any chances. Well, that's fun. Is every meeting gonna be like that? So Kat and Charlie's has a lot of potential, they're a good fit for the Everson brand. The problem is they're a relatively new business so there's not a long history of sales to bank on. Hello? Hi. Hello. Hi. And not a long history of sales to bank on. Did you read the files I sent you? Enough of them. Come on. Not a person in the world could have read through all the files you sent in one night. Follow my lead. Follow my lead. This is amazing, what you guys have built here. Did you know that you were gonna get into ice cream when you met each other? To tell you the truth we were just a couple of grad students having fun. Suddenly our crazy flavours caught on and the whole thing just took off. We were surprised as anyone by how it grew. Don't get us wrong, we have had a blast in the last few years. But neither one of us planned on spending our lives in the ice cream business. No. Right this way. Look at this. The financial records that you asked for are all in here. Thank you. And here are some of our top sellers for you to try. Thank you, Kelly. Looks terrific. Well, we will leave you to it and if you have any questions we will be at an employee event. OK. Thank you. Yeah, let's try some ice cream. No, we're not here to try ice cream, we're here to work. You're not gonna try the product of the company you might acquire? What if you don't like it? It doesn't matter if I like it. It matters if other people like it. Sales. Past sales. Projected sales. Operating costs. Why don't we take a walk around? Meet some employees? Get to know the place, you know? Get a feel. OK, OK. I think we probably have very different ways of going about this so why don't you assess the company the way that you want to and I will assess the company the right way? Right way? Alright. Yeah, this is... this is fun, guys. Do you do this all the time? This is great. OK, up next: green tea wasabi swirl. OK. I don't know how I feel about this one. - I can't... - We need some water. Yeah, thank you. That one... that one has a big kick to it. OK, moving on. Strawberry bourbon blast. Right. Yeah, it's a Mardi Gras in my mouth. The winner of the $500 gift card and a limited run of their flavour put into production next month is... strawberry bourbon blast. Way to go, congratulations. Let's hear it for our guest judge! Judging from what I saw, Kat and Charlie's is too risky. Their books show a major shift in earnings over the last quarter, their financial projections for next year are way off. Judging from what I saw they're inventive, fun, they have great product, and it's a company that Everson Valley Farms can really take places. I like the idea of bringing a youthful element to the brand. Mr. Everson, my mission is to find you a money maker. A company that makes this place as strong as possible before we go public... They have... This isn't it. A delicious product. That matters. She didn't even taste it. Books don't lie. Nothing great comes without a little risk. Alright, this is not a competition. You both make valid points. Cat and Charlie's seems like a company to track but for right now let's put it on the back burner and keep looking. We need a real game changer for our portfolio that'll take us to the next level. Now, we don't have the luxury of time here. You two need to get on the same page. Fast. Hi. I'm just meeting a friend. Thanks. Looks like the weekend came just in time. You look exhausted. Yeah, I am. 'Cause I'm working with someone who's exhausting. Yeah, let's buy a kitschy little ice cream shop and then guess who's left holding the bag when it doesn't work out? So the search continues I assume? I just feel like I got thrown a real curve ball. In fact, I gotta nip this in the bud. Anything from Reeltraveler? No. Not yet. It's probably for the best. There. Attached is all the data from Monday's meeting with Harbor Coffeeworks. Please read all the files. You gotta be kidding me. You're relentless. Why am I even here? Wanna chat? How was my day? Better already. I have to. Reeltraveler, I've told you that I'm single. May I assume that, if you're writing me, you are too? Yes, I am single. And in case you were wondering, I'm 36. He's 36. He's 36. Well, this just got interesting. What are the odds? Me too. OK. I know we're not sharing too much about our location or identities yet but I have to ask... Where did you find my letter? I'm dying to know. On a beach in Maine. Go figure. Why don't you tell me more about yourself? I just wanna hear more about you. Me too. You first. I don't know where to start. I guess you could say I'm someone who hasn't quite figured out where home is yet. Home is Boston. My parents had me when they were older, though, and now they're retired and living on the other side of the country, which I hate. It makes me feel really lonely sometimes. But I'm lucky. I have an aunt here in town and I absolutely cherish her. I have always wondered what it would be like to have a sister. I know I would have loved it. I got lucky. I have one and she's a gem. What's been your favourite trip? Fly fishing in Patagonia. You? The aunt I told you about, she took me to Paris for a week after I graduated from high school. I'll never forget it. Checkmate! I can knit. My mom taught me. I'm crazy about dogs. It kills me not to have one. But it doesn't make sense for me to have one right now. I get it. I can't wait to have one. And I want it to be an older dog. When I see those faces at a shelter, the ones with the sprays of white on their muzzles, they're so beautiful. I just know they have a story to tell and you could see how much they would love to be loved again. I can't believe it's Sunday night already. Talking to you has made the weekend fly right by. Honestly, the idea of going to work tomorrow doesn't exactly thrill me. The project I'm working on... well, there's a co-worker I'm having trouble with. A real know-it-all. Incredibly stubborn. I know the type. But if I were to be truly honest, my problem isn't with my co-worker, it's with my boss. I want him to know how much I respect him. We just see things differently. I can give advice but I'm afraid it's going to be blunt. Give it to me. At the end of the day, you are there to do the job at hand. Are you getting it done? Ask yourself have you really given it your all? If you have, then unfortunately there's nothing more that you can do, really. But if not, then that's on you. So, Reeltraveler, which is it? So we just went back and forth all weekend and he's so easy to talk to. I just feel like I can open up to him, you know? See? Good things happen when you're willing to go for it. Well, I like the look of this. I'm settling in. I actually got some advice from a friend over the weekend and I'm taking it. It was someone I met, actually. What? You met someone? You have to tell me. No, no, no. I just... it's too early to even say anything yet. We're just emailing, online chats, you know. Shocking. You're using the internet. I know how to use the internet. I haven't been living in the woods that long. It's been a while. It's just we... had this instant connection. She's open. She's engaging. She's passionate about things. I like the sound of her already. I actually stayed up half the night working on this Harbor Coffeeworks meeting and today Abbey Lawrence isn't gonna know what hit her. Yeah, I'm even early. You are, actually. Speaking of which, have you seen her? I'm supposed to meet her in the lobby. Hey! Yeah. I swear, I was on time. I've been here for hours, actually. But I was in the office. Well, on time usually means being in the agreed upon spot, not just in the building. Just tell me you're ready. Harbor Coffeeworks is exactly the kind of company we're looking for. Yeah, started small, steady growth, great numbers, they source their beans exclusively from a farm in Indonesia that grows in volcanic soil. I'm impressed. You actually did do your research. But we're not the only game in town and we have to convince Stan Tucker to sell to us. No problem. I will follow your lead. We'll go straight, right? The car's over here? Thanks, Stan. You got 'er. Thank you. My pleasure. Harbor Coffeeworks is built off my impeccable taste and good judgement. I don't plan on letting them go too easily. After last week's article in the Globe, naming us hands down the best coffee in Boston, let's just say there's been a lot of interest. As well there should be, but I would like to point out that this meeting has been on the books for the last three months. We saw what you had here well before that article came out. You did. I like that. But why should I sell over to Everson so easily and so early on? Why don't I just sit back and wait for the highest bidder? Do you mind if I take this one, Abbey? Sure. Thank you. Stan, I did my research and I know this all started with you pushing a coffee cart around a mall with your best friend, Bernie Cranford. And I also know that Bernie took the investor that you found, along with your original blend, and he started Bernie's Brews. But that didn't stop you. No. No, I started over again on my own and developed a new blend. A better blend, and I built all of this. And now Harbor Coffeeworks is Bernie's Brews number one competitor in the north east. That's why... We can make you go national, fast. Our Aunt Betsy's Breakfast Boutiques are opening up in every major city across the country. Picture Bernie's face when he gets off an airplane in California and he sees Aunt Betsy's Breakfast Boutiques now featuring Boston's Harbor Coffeeworks. Keep talking. You can sit here and wait for offer after offer because you've created something special, Stan. Or you can join the Everson Valley Farms family and have the future of Harbor Coffeeworks start now. Alright. Let's do this. OK, Stan. This is gonna be the best decision that you have ever made. Yeah, I hope so. I can't help but notice, it's a great photo. Yeah, thank you very much. That's very sweet. Who doesn't like an ugly sweater party, huh? What do you mean? What do you mean? - He's kidding. - I meant... yeah, no... He has terrible taste. Awfully, it looks like an awfully expensive sweater. It just looks very fancy. It's like a very fancy sweater. I just... she's got beautiful long hair, too. This meeting is over. That was Stan Tucker. The offer is officially declined. Sir, Stan is a temperamental man and I think that if we give him a little time we could circle back. We don't have time to circle back. The Harbor Coffeeworks deal is dead. How could I have known that his wife had such bad taste? I'm sorry. I don't understand. You know how to do this, Nick. Sir, actually Nick gave... You don't need to explain, Abbey. Maybe my expectations were too high. Let's start over. We really don't know anything about each other except I can see you have some tension with your father. Yeah, he wants me to follow in his footsteps. It's great for Soph, she loves it. But it's not you. The Everson Valley Farms that I fell in love with, it wasn't a corporation. It was my grandfather's farm, you know? A place I'd spend my summers working outside with my hands. Yeah. I just... I don't speak his language like you and Soph. I wish I had what you have. You can just walk into a room and be spontaneous. You're so open. I don't like to be spontaneous. I don't know how. I never would have guessed that. Yeah, yeah. I'm working on it. Thank you. Wanna be spontaneous right now? Come on. Hey, little buddy. This was such a good idea. Ah, dogs. An instant mood changer. If you could take home one of these today which one would you take? I think I'd take this one home right here. Yeah? You'd take an old dog? I think everybody deserves a second chance. Don't you? You know, at first I... I felt forced into this. But helping grow the family business, it's important to me. I think if we're gonna do this let's go big. Let's do it right. I have an idea. Wilmore Estates. It's a cidery, orchard and inn with huge possibilities for expansion and the owner, George Wilmore, is notorious for refusing to sell, which is why I took it off the list because we just don't have enough time and I was trying to be conservative. But I have to be honest, I've had my eye on this place for years. This place looks incredible. I know. It's the ultimate get, but we'd have to rearrange our whole schedule with all the other prospects but you're inspiring me. I think we should go big. Let's go for it. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. OK. So here is a list of all the other companies we have meetings with. You call them and I'll call the Wilmore Estates. Done. Hey. You're looking upbeat. I thought the meeting at Harbor Coffeeworks went badly. It did. It tanked. But we got our heads back in the game and now we're going after something big. Which makes me think... why not go big in other areas of my life, too? Like with little miss internet? Maybe. Hi, this is Abbey Lawrence. I'm calling from Everson Farms and I'd like to make an appointment with George Wilmore. Yes, I can hold. The project I've been working on is here in Boston. Should we meet? This whole time he has been here in Boston. That's good. I guess. I mean, it's kinda weird. I've been imagining this guy I've been getting to know who's great and he lives in Maine. It's so much easier to open up to somebody who's far away. It's... it's like... It's safe. Yeah. A bit of a fantasy. Trust me, sweetheart. This is better. This is exciting. This is real. Real is what I want. Yes, let's meet. Let's meet. Yes. Yes! How's tomorrow? Tomorrow? Yes! Tomorrow. Oh, tomorrow. Tomorrow it is. Yes, I'd like to make a reservation for tonight, for 7:00. For two people. Name is Nick Everson. Alright, thank you. See you then. How's 7:00 pm? Just off Cook Street. A little restaurant called Luigi's. I love that place. Nick? Hey, before you go on your big date I need Abbey's list of companies I have to call? Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll... Nick? - The list? - One second. Nicholas. Yeah-yeah. Hello? Hi, Nick. It's Abbey. Listen, I just wanna make sure you had that list of the companies to call. It needs to be done tonight. Can you just give it to Sophie and she'll do it? Yeah, yeah. I'm giving it to her right now. - Abbey. - Yeah. It's you. Yes, it's me. - It's you. - Yes, it's me, Abbey. The handwriting. It's the same as the letter. I don't know what's going on, Nick, but I gotta go. Bye. Hello? Abbey. Nick, what is going on? Why does Abbey have stationary with the initials ML on it? Her full name is Mary Abigail Lawrence. Abbey is ML Beantown. What? Abbey is ML Beantown. She's the one that I've been emailing. She's going to meet me at the restaurant right now. She knows me as Reeltraveler175. It's too early. It's gonna ruin everything! This can't happen! Nick! It's OK. Just calm down. I have no idea what you're talking about. This is what I do know. I have never seen you this happy before, so whatever it takes to keep this woman, do it. Soph, I just... I need a minute to process this right now. Yeah, you don't have a minute. Dear ML Beantown, something's come up tonight and I can't meet you. My sincerest apologies. I believe that there are more layers to people than we ever imagined. Is this really Abbey? I can't believe I just left you standing there. Blocked. ML Beantown, I feel so terrible about last night and more than anything I want to apologize and explain. She blocked me. - Hi. - Hey. I brought you a little coffee... a doughnut with some sprinkles on it. That's... thoughtful. Yeah, well you've been holed up in here all morning, I just wanted to make sure you were OK. Are you OK? You alright? Yeah, fine. Thank you. You should know George Wilmore passed on the meeting. I couldn't really get past the front office. I don't know why I let myself get distracted with it. I'm sorry. You know, you put yourself out there and you... you get your hopes up and then you just get disappointed so... this is what we're gonna do. Smith's Oatmeal. It's a small company, tiny actually, but it fits with our brand and we can sweep in and just scoop them right up. What happened to going big? Wowing? We don't have time and I don't want to try for something bigger and then end up with nothing. Are you giving up? This may not be big enough to wow your father or warrant a promotion but it is an addition to the portfolio. It's something. And that's better than nothing. OK. OK. Owner of Wilmore Estates, George Wilmore shares his five favourite fishing spots. His favourite being in his own backyard at his cidery and inn. I need you to go home. Start prepping. For what? I'm picking you up early tomorrow morning and we're heading to Wilmore Estates. Bring an overnight bag just in case. I told you George Wilmore doesn't want to sell. - It's impossible. - It's not that impossible. I put my feelers out there, spoke to a few friends, and I was put in touch with somebody who works for him. Her name is Deirdre. Deirdre who? I'll have a whole bio written up for you tomorrow, you can read it in the car. The whole point is, is we're meeting her at 10:00 and then we're meeting him. I can't believe you got a meeting. I couldn't even get in the door. You know what? Honestly, it doesn't matter because Wilmore's gonna say no. This is probably a huge waste of time. OK, look. I know we don't know each other too well and hopefully I'm not crossing a line here but you were all dressed up yesterday and today you're upset. Did you have a bad date? Unbelievable. You guys are all the same. You know, you see a woman upset and you automatically assume it's about a guy. You know, it's not always about you. It's not about a guy? It's... it is this time, but it's just annoying that you would assume that. Well, you should forget that guy. Look, we have an opportunity to meet George Wilmore. The Abbey Lawrence that I know would not walk away from that. And read all the files, OK? If we're gonna work together I need you to be fully prepared and up to speed. Yeah, suddenly he's leading the charge, he's taking initiative, he's actually got us this meeting. Sounds like he has a lot more going for him than you first thought. Yeah, I don't know. If my experience with Reeltraveler is of any indication I'm not a great judge of character. You don't know for sure. Something could have happened. But you'll never know because you blocked him. Is this fancy cheese or just mould? Reeltraveler, I was hurt when you didn't show up for our date. My first instinct was to block you. Well, I look forward to telling you everything in person. For now, please know that I feel awful to have hurt you. It's not that I didn't want to see you, it's just... I'm still working it out. Good morning. Hi. Is Abbey... No, no, no, no, no. You're in the right place, Nick. Come on. Come right in. Hi. Hey, Aunt Francis. What're you doing here? Well, you gave me a key last Christmas. Did you sleep over? The key was for emergencies. This is an emergency. I needed to check out the guy that's taking my niece on a road trip. Well, I'm the guy. Hi, I'm Nick Everson. No, please, I'm a hugger. Aunt Francis, I have heard wonderful things. Thank you. I like him. OK, bye. I mapped out our whole... thank you. I mapped out our trip on this travel app... We're actually going to make a stop on the way. Yeah, don't worry about it. I've already arranged that we're gonna meet Deirdre an hour later. I got it all worked out. Buh-bye. You're having a really difficult time with this stop, aren't you? No, I'm fine, I'm fine, I like diners. It's all fine. I mean, I do like to know what's going on. I'm not sure why you didn't just tell me we had a stop. I could have planned that but that's fine. You never told me who this Dee-Deirdre-Deirdre. - Deirdre? - Deirdre. - Deirdry? - Deirdre. - Deirdre. - Dra. It doesn't matter. Who is she? Trust me. Trust me. You just said that. You said that a second ago when you ordered for me. You ordered a number two on the menu, which I don't even know what that is... It's the best thing on the menu. But I don't know what it is. No, it doesn't matter if you know what it is. How are you just gonna steamroll over me when you don't even know what I like? Pancakes! Thank you. These look so good. Maybe this wasn't such a bad idea after all. That's beautiful. Look how good that looks. Yeah. Oh, man. You know, I really do love to get out of the city sometimes. Did I tell you I have a thing for pancakes? Here are the keys to your rooms. Let me know if there's anything else we can help with. Thank you so much, Deirdre, I really appreciate it. It's beautiful here. Is that the... that's not the Deirdre... that's not our contact that we're meeting, right? Yeah. She works for Wilmore, and we just met her. Here's your room key. What about Wilmore? There's no meeting with Wilmore, is there? I promise you we are meeting Wilmore. He just... doesn't know it yet. I knew it! I knew you couldn't get a meeting that fast! How could you just drag me all the way out here? You told me yourself, you're not spontaneous. If I would have told you that we were driving up here and just winging it there's no way you would have gotten in the car. Just have a little faith, alright? Think of it as an adventure. Here. - You're gonna need those. - What is this? Meet me in the lobby in 20 minutes, OK? What is this? OK. I hope there's a good reason for this. Well, if you're gonna meet someone it helps to know where they're gonna be. OK, you coming? It's just beautiful out here. This could be it. This is the third spot we've tried. Yeah, well the article said he goes fishing on his property, not where on his property. Well, this is business, that's what I told you, we have to plan. What? There he is. Here's the plan. We have no plan. Hey! Didn't realize somebody else was here. It's mine. - I'm Nick. - Hey. And this is Abbey. Hi. Yeah, she lost the coin toss. That's right. OK, but as soon as you catch your fish I want us to go out to the orchards, right? We're gonna go check it out. Yeah, deal. We're gonna go to a tasting, I want to see all that. Yeah, deal. Deal? - Deal. - Deal. So, you're gonna keep your elbow high, don't break your wrist. OK. So... Not a lot of movement in your wrist. Hope we're not distracting you too much. No, it's fine, I'm enjoying watching the two of you, actually. Pull it up, pull that line out. - Yeah. - OK. Like flicking paint on a wall. This is it? This is so easy. Alright, yeah. That's pretty good. It's not... it's not easy. Yeah, you know, he's right. It does take a lot of practice. Wait. Yeah. Oh my gosh! - You do have something. - I totally have something! - You do have something! - I have a fish. Lock your reel. Lock your reel. Oh my gosh! Reel it in! Oh gosh. Look at that! Look at the size of it! It's a big one, too! Talk about beginner's luck! I never seen anything like it! I'm gonna set this guy free. Alright. We caught a fish! You caught your fish! OK, let's go. You caught your fish. I should catch a fish, too, right. The deal was to catch a fish and then... - We're already out here. - I want to go taste the cider. Listen, you two. Please, you're scaring all the fish. Just go to the cidery, please. - Sorry. - Sorry. - Sorry. - Sorry about that. Wait. I'm George Wilmore. If you promise to go to the cidery I'll take you both on a personal tour if you just go and let me fish for an hour of peace and quiet. - Of cour... - OK. Absolutely. Of course. Gee. Thank you so much. I'll see you in an hour. OK. Peace and quiet. - Sorry. We're not even here. - We're not here, yeah. After the harvest we ferment from anywhere form four weeks to several months depending on the type of cider. We keep the temperature at a constant, that's critical, and if you come this way I can show you another little secret. So we have two regular ciders and five of the hard ciders, but we're always changing things up. I look at cider making the way wine makers approach wine. Here's a few of our newer, harder ciders if you care for a taste. Yes, absolutely. Thank you. Is that pineapple I'm tasting? No? Oh, no. I believe that's orange, right? Very perceptive. Thank you so much. I can't thank you enough for taking the time to show us around the property. Actually, Mr. Wilmore, we have something we would like to talk with you about. The two of you just enjoy your time here. We're having the cidery's 30th anniversary party tonight at the main house. Our friends and employees will all be there. Let's talk then. Sure. Yeah, that sounds great. OK. But first, let me show you the orchard itself. Right this way. This is it. This is amazing. It reminds me a lot of my grandparent's farm. That was my favourite place in the world. You've built something really special here, Mr. Wilmore. Thank you. Yes, I have. And now I've got some business to deal with - but you two enjoy the orchard. - Oh, we will. - Thank you for everything. - Yeah, thanks so much. It's been my pleasure. I'll see you two at the party later tonight, alright? - Yes. - Yeah. Thank you. You know, we're only an hour from the city. Families are coming here, bringing their kids, going apple picking... Going for hay rides. We can expand on the fishing. We could build cabins for extended stays and make this a wedding destination. The possibilities are endless. Abbey, I mean... you were right. This place is special. I need the... the land evaluation. Thank you. Looks like we're pretty well all set. Now we just gotta convince him. I have been watching you here and you seem different. This place really brings something out in you. I think I'm a little more relaxed. It reminds me of a time when Everson Valley Farms was just a farm, not a corporation. Well, you keep surprising me. You know, the other night... when I was upset, I had a date and this guy that I thought I had a great connection with just really let me down. And then you, somebody who I didn't really trust, are coming through all of a sudden. You always do that. What? Arrange things. I do? I do. Yeah, you do. And if you don't wanna do something, or you don't want to go somewhere, you have the funniest quirk. You go... - Right there. - Right there? Yeah. Yeah. Oh no. Well, we should probably get ready for the party. Yeah. Hey, that guy that let you down. Yeah. You gonna talk to him again? I don't know. I thought we had a really great connection, but I don't know. Maybe it's time to give somebody else a chance. I think we should go. You look absolutely beautiful. Thank you. Excuse me, everyone. If I could have your attention, please. If you could all just come in a little closer, please. I just want to say a few words. 30 years. It's gone by in a flash. But I loved every one of those years because I had my lovely wife, Nancy, by my side. Nancy and I met when I was in the army and she got assigned to be my pen pal. We wrote back and forth for months on end and before I knew it I had fallen in love with someone I had never met. And just my luck she was beautiful, too. Tonight I'd like all of you to know that you are our family and you make our estate feel like a home. So I'd like to make a toast. To my home. To the Wilmore Estates and to everyone that makes it special. Do you want to dance? What? Your shot. - Your chance. - Yeah, yeah. Mr. Wilmore. Abbey, I'm so glad you could make it. Would you care to dance? I would love to. It's a great party. You and your wife are such a lovely couple. Thank you. I think you and Nick make a pretty nice couple, yourselves. We're not together. That's funny, that's not what I saw. About us, I actually wanted to be honest with you about why we're here. I know why you're here. I may have my secretary refuse calls from all acquisition people but I still take a look and see who's called. So you knew who we are and you still showed us around? Well, you did catch that big fish. And the truth is I've always promised my wife I'd sell the place one day and travel the world but I just keep putting it off. Maybe the two of you showing up here on the 30th anniversary is a sign. Now, don't get your hopes up, but I'll hear you out. OK... Send any paperwork up to the house tonight and I'll look it over, alright? Yes. Yes, I'll send it right away. Great. I'll see you both tomorrow morning at 9:00 am sharp in my office. Yes. Perfect. Thank you. He had us pegged for the entire time. I know, I can't believe it. But he still wants to meet with us. Thank you. This is turning out to be a really good adventure. Well, thank you for being willing to take the risk. I... I should get back to my room. We have a really big day tomorrow. Hi. Hello. Hey, did you by any chance tell me the meeting was an hour earlier so I wouldn't be late? No. OK. I'll see you soon. You're the best. OK, I break down the numbers, wow him with the offer. I represent the family, give him the big brand pitch, wow him with what he's going to be handing his legacy off to. - We got this. - Yeah, we do. Oktoberfest cider, Christmas cider... - Honey Valentine's Day cider. - I like that. St. Patrick's Day cider. What's that one you said? Easter bunny. - The bunny cider! - The bunny cider. Yeah. We can build the Wilmore brand both locally and nationally. In short Mr. Wilmore, we see everything that you've built here. And we love all of it. Well, my wife and I have been going over this offer all morning. It's very impressive. I want you to know that we gave it serious consideration, but the answer's gonna be no. Mr. Wilmore, I understand you may have hesitations... you said you were willing to sell and this offer is unbeatable. - It's an incredible offer. - Yeah. Yes, it is. And maybe who I end up selling to won't be able to offer me anything close to this but I've realized that the idea of letting everything I've built just get swallowed up into a big corporation makes me uncomfortable. I'm sorry. I like you both very much but the answer's no. I knew it was a long shot but I really thought we were going to pull it off. I don't regret that we tried. Yeah, me neither. I guess we go back to the office now, head back to corporate and leave this place. You don't belong in corporate. You belong in a place like this. Your dad never said you had to work in corporate, he just wanted you to be a part of what he built for his family. You are a genius. Come on! Come in. Mr. Wilmore, could we bother you for one more moment of your time? Alright. OK. Mr. Wilmore, ever since I got here this place, it felt special to me. It felt like... like home. What if it was purchased by Everson Valley Farms but run by me, Nick Everson, learning every detail of the place from you? Well, that would make selling to a big corporation feel different. I'm gonna talk to my wife. Hey sweetheart, can you come in here for a moment? Thank you! I can't believe it? We did it! Talk about cutting it close to the wire. I can't wait to tell your father! It's gonna take him a minute to digest, the me running the place part. I think he's gonna love it. We've got so many kinks to iron out. We've gotta get attorneys involved, I'm just... I'm so impressed with us. Well done. We did it. No, you did it. This is... this is exactly what I wanted. I... I need to tell you something. OK. Why do you have my letter? I found it, fishing in Maine. I had no idea that this was you. You're Reeltraveler? That's not possible. By the time that I knew it was you it was too late, you had already gone to meet me at the restaurant. Why didn't you show up? Because it was too early. We still had to work together. So you just thought you'd hold on to this and then bring me on this trip... this whole trip, the whole time, you knew to get me pancakes 'cause you knew I loved pancakes... You knew how to look at me and tell me I was beautiful the way that I wanted... Yes, but you are beautiful. I meant everything I said. It... I would... it took me a while to connect the person that I knew from the letter to the person I knew from work. Right. Right. The stubborn know-it-all who just made you dread going into work every day. No. I'm glad that I could help you find yourself and this is mine. I'm going to find my own way home. Abbey. I... I still can't believe Nick was Reeltraveler175. Yeah. And sitting right across the hall. I know. And he had my letter the whole time. You know, there were times when we were emailing when I felt like this is it. This guy gets me. And then there were times with Nick when I thought something's... something's really happening. And now I don't know what to trust or what to believe and I don't feel like any of it was real. Of course it was real. Well, I don't know. I don't know if I'll ever know that for sure. I just... I really don't get him not telling me, and I feel like I got played. Hey. Nick? I wanted to say I'm proud of you. Not only did you and Abbey come through for me, you brought us a place that lets Everson Valley Farms get back to its roots. A place that reminds me of where it all started. That part was all Abbey, dad. She saw the fit. She's been following what Wilmore's been doing for years. You've really found a place for yourself here, too. I think the thing I'm most proud of is that you've always stayed true to yourself, even when it put us at odds. That took guts. I'm happy to have you back in the business, son. Thanks, Dad. So the secret to the viscosity of our ciders is that we triple strain. Each one of these barrels holds 59 gallons, and they're handcrafted, made in Hungary. Summer 2014, we try to do our best to... Hello? Hello. Hi. Making pancakes. Comfort food. What's the matter? What've you got there? It's an invite to Kevin and Sophie's wedding. I just don't think I can go. He's gonna be there, he's part of the wedding party. I want you to do something for me. Get your letter. The message in a bottle? Yes. It's right here. Read me the end of the letter. Tell me what it says. I want something real. I have the depth to walk through real life struggle and come out the other side and I'm looking for someone like that, too. Flawed, but open. Impossible to label and file away. I think we all deserve that, don't we? I'm willing to take the risk. Come find me. That letter is you. Open. Brave. Still believing in love. Remember that. And you're going to the wedding. I am not allowing my niece to hide from life. He's right there. OK, let's just go. Don't look! Do you, Kevin, take Sophie to be your lawfully wedded wife, to have and to hold from this day forward for as long as you both shall live? I do. And do you, Sophie, take Kevin to be your lawfully wedded husband, to have and to hold from this day forward for as long as you both shall live? I do. I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride. You doing OK? Yeah. It's just hard to be back here where it all started. Yeah, well you did it. You're here. I think it's time that I exit gracefully, now. OK. Excuse me, miss. This is for you. Look to your right and follow the candlelit path. Go. Yes. Dear Mary Abigail Lawrence. I can't apologize enough. You see, the more I've thought about it the more I realized just how vulnerable you were. The whole time you were the one with your heart open, exposed in a letter. You were the one left standing, waiting. And throughout everything my heart was always safe. So now it's my turn to make myself vulnerable. To put my heart out into the world. I love the Abbey who shines at her job and expects the same from everyone else. Who's never late. I love the Abbey who takes such good care of her aunt, and the fact that pancakes can make you so happy. I even love that you are terrible at making pottery. I think you're beautiful, inside and out. I hate that I couldn't see right away that you and ML Beantown could be the same person, and I can't begin to tell you how much I miss that person. All I can do... ...is stand here and tell you how much I love you and ask that you forgive me, and hopefully that you love me as well. I've never been inspired to strive for something more or be willing to learn and grow. I don't want to run anymore. I want something real. And I even... I adopted a dog. What? Archie. You got Archie. I can't... I can't believe it. Hey. You opened your heart when you sent that message in a bottle. And now you've opened mine, too.
