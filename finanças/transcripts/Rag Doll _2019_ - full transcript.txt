I thought somebody had broken into the house! What are you doing up so early? Today just seemed like the perfect day to see the sunrise. Oh, and I may or may not have shat the bed. Let's get you cleaned up. [moaning in pain] Mom? -Hey. -Yeah? Hey, I just wanted to let you know Mrs. Peters is here. Mrs. Peters, what the hell for? It's your day off, Nora. It's fucking Sunday. I may be losing a lot of things, but my mind is not one of them. Yes, you are of very sound mind, Mom. That's right. Are you feeling alright? Yeah, I'm great. Well, I'm gonna take off to the gym, okay? Alright. I'll be back later. Knock yourself out. Be nice to Mrs. Peters today, okay? No. I won't. I bought milk. You ran out yesterday. I'm sorry, I didn't think about it. I need milk for my tea. I told you that when I agreed to watch over the house. I'm sorry, I'll do better. Please see that you do. I ask so little. [man] It's all knotted up. Come on girl, keep breathing. Breathe through it! Alright, you guys do it. You got like a sack of marbles in there, kid. You stretchin' at night? Mmhmm. You liar. You can't even fucking answer me right. Alright, where's my rag doll? [trainer] Come on Nora, let's go, you gotta warm up Aisha. Let's go! Let's go. You're on her. Get that choke out. What are you gonna do? Come on! [trainer] There you go. Now what are you gonna do if she tries to pass through? Yeah, take the arm back! Look, you don't even need to use your hands! Side control! Come on girl, take that. Get the arm bar! Alright, arm bars all day! Well actually, I can transition out of this. [trainer] Hey Nora, stop, watch the knee, come on! [Nora] Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Hey, shake it off. Alright, well, let's... well that's enough of this shit. Let's move on to something else. Aisha, come on. Let's go. [trainer] Find me someone else please. [man] Hey! Yeah you. Come on. Hey, good job. I like what I'm seeing. Thanks. [coughing] Here, here, here. Here. Water. Ah! Here, here. Come here. Shh, shh, shh. Calm down, calm down. I'm here, I'm here Mama. It's okay. I'm always gonna be here. Shh, shh, shh. Ah! Mom? Mom? Mom, hey. I gotta take off to work. Are you feeling better? Fuckin' A. Mom, language, seriously. I thought we talked about the positivity thing. They're only words, Nora. Like 73 across. The blank strikes back. Positive energy and no cursing, research says is gonna help you clear out a lot of negativity. Given all my bad influence, how'd you end up such a Girl Scout? That's fucking true. You're not funny. You have a fucking good time. I'll see you tonight. Thanks. [woman] How can I help you? I called in an order to fill in my mom's prescription. It's under Catherine Poe. -Catherine Poe? -Mmhmm. And you're Catherine Poe? Uh, no, that's my mother. -You're not Catherine Poe? -No. Hold on. Hm. She's in here, but... There's an error in my system, says no refills. I can give you another refill but just as a one-time courtesy. Okay? Mhmm. Okay. -What? -Thank you. [phone ringing] [woman] That will be seventy dollars. Oh, no. Actually, my mom has Medicare so that shouldn't be any cost. Okay. So it says here the classification for this drug has changed. Medicare only covers seventy-five percent. The rest is your copay. So then the copay is the seventy dollars. The co-pay is the seventy dollars. Well, I don't have seventy dollars. Do you have a credit card? No. -Debit card? -No, I don't have... We don't take checks. No, listen, you don't understand. I don't have seventy dollars. This has always been free. You know I was never called about this or anything, so I wasn't prepared to pay today, so I don't have seventy dollars. I don't know what you want me to do, um... I don't know what you want me to do. Look, the classification for the drug has changed. There's really nothing I can do. Do you know what that medication is? You know what the-- what that does? What I need it for? You're aware that my mom needs that medication, or she could die. Like you're aware of that, right? This has always been free. So I think there's just... I think you're doing something incorrect, and you need to fix it. -Okay. I've never had to pay for this. -You think I'm incorrect? Yes, I do. I think you should look into your computer and figure out a way to get my mother these drugs! The way to get your mom these drugs is to give me seventy dollars. This is fucking bullshit, can you go get somebody? Hey, hey doc. Hey doc, can I? [Nora] Go get your manager. I gotta go to work. -So I need to fucking get outta here-- -[man] Doc, can I? So please, can you give me my mom's medication. [man] Pharmacist? Can I talk to you for a second? One second. Yeah, hold on. So I'll just take care of it if it's okay. What? I'll just take care of it if it's okay. We can just add it to my, to my stuff and we can handle it. What? This isn't a bar ,sir. What-- what are you saying? I'll just take care of her stuff. -Her stuff? -Yeah! You want to pay for this woman? -Yeah. -Oh, no, I can't let you do that. -No, it's no problem. Seriously, it's not a big deal. -No, like really. -No, I... -Look, I don't have money to pay you back. [man] Look it's up to you, I just... My sister had cancer, so I understand what you're going through... and uh, yeah, I mean, I got it-- You're a nice man. Oh, uh... Jason Wright. With a "W". With a "W". Wright. -Right. -Right. Okay. Lexapro, Risperdal... Yeah! Yes. Thank you. [pharmacist] You're welcome. It's early. I need some coffee. You need some coffee? Wanna get some coffee? Um... [pharmacist] There's instant. You can just have it. Thank you. Have a good day. Have a better day. Yeah. Thank you. I have your drinks right here. Yo, I got this. Don't even mess with me. Okay. That'll be $11.50. Shit. So um... you said your-- your sister had cancer? Yeah. Breast. Oh. What did you guys do? Did you guys just do like straight chemo? Did you try, like, the new drug trials, or... The doctors kept misdiagnosing her. I mean, like, when they found out what it actually was, it was too late. Oh. I'm...I'm so sorry. Oh yeah, no. I mean, death is... death. But you can't-- you can't go backwards, right? You can't go backwards. That's what all this-- I mean, I guess what some of these head drugs are for, and I talk to the group.

No, I'm good. Thank you, though, yeah. -Yeah? Right. -That's not-- No, I mean, no. I just was, was saying-- Oh shit, I really gotta go, I'm sorry. Look, this was all awesome, and I really appreciate it, but I just-- But you, But you don't wanna talk to the-- you don't wanna talk to the crazy guy, right? No! Like, my dad used to take a lot of the stuff that you were, um... Oh! Cool! I mean, not cool that your dad was like, I mean, like me, but it's just cool that-- Okay, I really have to go. I've gotta catch the 10:15 across town, so sorry, but thank you! Why, why're you cro-- the 10:15 across town, why're you gonna do that? Because it's the fastest way across town. Yo, why do guys always think that they know the fastest way around? No! I'm-- I'm a driver! Yeah! I have a perfect four star rating. I don't need a ride from you. You've already done enough. Seriously, I got you. You're not gonna make it. You'll probably miss the bus, and uh, I'm a good driver. I can take you. So, what? Do I like, "app" you, or something? No! I'm my own boss. Let's go. And I'm fast! Safe! Safe and fast. Cool. Well, thank you. This was-- you know your car is so nice. -Yeah. -And it was very sweet of you. Yeah, thank you. This is something I do to meet people.

I mean, sometimes it's actually better to fight with girls, they put up more of a fight. I'd like to-- I'd like to see that. I mean, do you-- at the gym do you guys have fights? Like matches? Fi-- fighting matches? You like fights? I mean, me personally, I couldn't hurt a fly, but I like, I mean I think I'd like to like, watch it. You know, 'cause it's-- the fighting, to see the fighting is like, you know, it's like cathartic! Um, well, uh, my gym is hosting a tournament in about two weeks. It's a female MMA tournament. What?

One o'clock? Not today, man. Man, I told you that boxing shit is no good for business. I mean, maybe some dude's into that black eye stuff, but come on man, look at you. You're all jacked up and swolled up like a dude. Well, I gotta lay off anyways. I got a fight this weekend. No, no, no, no, no.

Oh, I know. You think that nobody's gonna find out what the fuck you doin' around here? Shit, Jesus tried to get me to do that same shit. And I was like, "Nah, fuck that!" No, bitch. Don't look at me like that, like I couldn't. Like you. Why can't you just leave me alone? Because I don't fuckin' like you. You're entitled. You're mean. You walk around here like you own this shit.

You 'bout to do somethin'? I'm guessin' that you got somethin' coming to you. Let's go. You think I'm finna fight you right now at my job? Why not? Um, real adults in real life actually care about getting paid for shit. All of us can't fuck for work and for money. So I need this job. So, it's not gon' be today, not here, but it's comin' to you. 'Cause you fuckin' deserve it. Walkin' around here like your shift don't stink. You ain't nothin', bitch. You just like the rest of us bitches, walkin' around here, cleaning rooms. Get that through your skull, how 'bout that? Fuckin' psycho. Lazy as shit Nora. Go ahead, drink your soda. I plan on it. Got nothin' to be done around here, right?

I got a waiver request for you to enter the tournament. Is that right? You entered? [Nora] Yeah. Alright. Why not? Where's my mother? Oh, hey. Hello. [Mrs. Peters] See you tomorrow. Oh! Mrs. Peters? Yes? Um, I'm not gonna have the money to pay for the next few days. Would it be okay if I just paid you in full next week? That's not our arrangement. I know, um, I was kinda hopin' you'd help me out and it'd be like a one-time thing. The reason arrangements are made is so that all the parties involved know what's expected of them. -I know, I just thought that may-- -Jesus Christ, Mary! If she says she's gonna pay you next week, she'll pay you next week! Don't be such a fucking dickweed! -Uh-- -I'll see you tomorrow. -Oh, and Mrs. Peters? -Yes? I also have something this Saturday night. Again, not agreed to! I know, but it's just a one-time thing. Double. Oh, jump in front of a fucking truck, Mary. That's fine! Double, that's totally fine. Thank you, Mrs. Peters. Thank you. Oh, she is such a bitch! Too much. Stop it with all that. No! She is messing with my positive healing energy. You know, if you're going to play cards with the terminally ill, you should at least lose a few hands. It's only polite. Just 'cause you suck at cards, mom, doesn't mean that she's a cheater. She has no fucking class. Aw, I used to be strong. I used to have boobs. This shit just eats everything. Nora, tell me... What are your odds in this thing? 'Cause, you know, it'll be weird if you die before I do. That's all I'm sayin'. Mom, I'm fighting for you. You know, this is a lot of money. Honey, don't fight for me. Fight for you. This is stage four. Stage four of fucking four. Yeah, well, you'll thank me when you overcome the odds. Oh, I won't be here to thank anyone. And then what are you gonna do? Hm? Mom-- Look, Nora, I'm gonna die, and it'll probably be in the next two months. And you need a realistic plan. I'm not listening to this shit. You will lose this house without my disability, then where are you gonna go? What are you gonna do? I have a plan. I'm gonna win this tournament, I'm gonna win the money, and I'm gonna get you the proper care that you need! Oh, honey, that's not real. That's just a dream. Well, it's my dream. Stop trying to take it away from me. Hey! Nora! Yo! Hey, it's me! It-- It's Jason! Oh, hey, what's up, Jason? Yeah, I gotta go to work. No, hey, wait! Wait one second, though! What do you want, man? Um, I-- Look, I already thanked you for helping with my mom's medication. I really have nothing else I can give you. I just-- I just can't stop thinking about you. But-- I mean, not-- I mean, not in like in some crazy person way. Some like, some guy who just-- just shows up at your work unannounced. No, not like that guy, but more like the guy who is well-balanced on his meds and he just really thinks that you're this super cool chick and would love to get a chance to get to know you better kind of way. Look, I'm sorry. You seem nice. That doesn't mean I owe you anything. I shoulda wore the V-neck! I should've worn the V-neck. I-- You know, it could've-- coulda gone worse. Coulda gone worse. [Jesus] Aight, give me another week, alright? I-- Alright. Alright, man, don't be a tough guy, alright? Do you-- If you-- Alright. Okay, you're right, you got it. Yes, sir! Anytime, after 3 PM, check-in! Very good, uh, just stop by and we can accommodate. Very good. Thanks. [Nora] Uh, Mr. Burns? Ah, Nora! Um, what can I do for you? Oh. More problems with Sasha? Have a seat. No. Um, I actually need to ask for Saturday off. Satur-- This Saturday? -Yeah. -Saturday, you know, is our busiest day of the week. Is it-- Is it that important to you? -Yeah, it really is. -Aw, you're killin' me here. You're killin' me, Nora! You-- Saturday we're gonna be especially busy. Um. I will think about it, okay? I will-- I don't know if I can deal with this now. I'll think about it. I'll, I'll let you know. Mr. Burns, I never ask for time off. I know that, I know that. But you're my best girl. I-- What am I gonna do? I'm here for you all the time! All I'm asking is for one day. Saturday. Yes. It's gonna be really busy Saturday. Thank you, Mr. Burns. Hey-- you owe me! Eh, apparently I owe everyone. [Jesus] Who was the suit? What are you talking about? Mr. GQ in the grey beamer! What, you back-doorin' me, Nora?

Nah, you wanna deal, you deal through me! I'm not dealing! He's just some guy I met! You just met some rich ass guy, right? If you're gonna lie, at least make it convincing. What is that supposed to mean? No suit goes bottom trollin'! I catch you fuckin' around my back again, I'm gonna mess you up, Nora. Yo, you don't own me, alright? Why don't you back up? The fuck you doin'? You fuckin' crazy, huh? Fucking crazy? -[woman] Are they fighting? -[woman] Oh yeah, they are. -[woman] Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Oh shit! -[woman] What the fuck? Oh my god! Hit back, Jesus! You look stupid! -You're gettin' your ass beat! -[Jesus] Enough! You a pussy, Jesus, that's crazy. She just molly wopped you. He didn't do nothin', he just stood there! Yeah, you got fucked up. Fuck y'all! [woman laughing] Got your ass kicked! I didn't get my ass kicked! Fuck you-- oh shit! -Oh shit! -Oh! Oh shit! Nope! Nope, you're dead. He's fucked up. -You're gonna die, you can't breathe. -Damn! Better stand up, Jesus! Stand up! What the hell is go-- What is going on here? Get her off me! Jesus, stop it, and you get off of her right now! I'm ch-- me? She's cho--! Get-- Break it up, you two! C'mon! Behave like humans, for crying out loud! Jesus! In my office, right now! Man, fuck her! I said now! Get the hell in my office! And you two! Sasha, mind your own business! Get-- No. No! This is my business, Mr. Burns! You know, you-- you're always playing favorites! And you know, your favorite has been fuckin' Johns in these rooms night after night for months right under your nose! That's right. How you feel about that? You're welcome, we told you. Nora, is this true? Nora, I'm talking to you. Just tell me it is not true. Oh, God. [woman] Yep. Boom. You two, get back to work. Get-- go! You just-- you just- Got the truth now. You're welcome. I give you every break in the book, and this is what you do to me? Forget the Johns, you fucked me! I thought you were better than that. Just get your shit and go. You do not work here anymore. Get your hands up, Nora! C'mon! C'mon! -Come here! -Keep moving, keep moving! What the hell? Why'd you enter the tournament if you're just gonna stand there? The fuck is your problem, Nora? I don't have a problem! What do you mean you don't have a fuckin' problem? You got a big ass problem! -Come on! -You entered the competition and you can't even beat Rosheen! Oh, co-- What? You don't have to fight in this fuckin' competition! I don't fuckin' have a choice. I don't fucking have a choice! Are you girls gonna fight or Nora, you need me to string you up and let everyone use you as a punching bag? Come on! -I am fighting! -No, you're fuckin' not! -Then fight, Nora! Fuckin' fight! Fight! Fight, Nora! -[man] Hey, hey! Come on-. Alright, that's enough! Fuckin' fight! [trainer] Hey, that's enough! Let it go! Get up! Get up! Get up! -Fuckin' fight! -[trainer] Come on. -Fuckin' fight! -Come on, let it go! -She ain't doin' shit! -Take a fuckin' walk! -She's not fuckin' doin' shit! -Hey! -This is the tournament! Get your ass out and take a walk! -Yes it is! Get up. No, no, no. Get in here. The fuck's goin' on with you? Nothing. I'm fine. Get it together. Aight? I'm sorry, Aisha. I didn't mean to mess up your training. It's just I'm messing everything up nowadays. Stop feeling sorry for yourself, and fight for what the fuck you really want. Yeah, I don't know what I want anymore. [Nora] Mom? -[coughing] -Mrs. Peters, were you sleeping? Is that my mom coughing? You're supposed to be watching her! Jesus! Mom. Hey! Mom! Mom, wake up. Mom. You okay? No, no, I'm okay. This is normal, everyday death spiral shit. You're okay? Yeah, I'm okay. Alright, 'cause I brought you dinner. Oh! Let me guess, chicken! No, I brought you hamburgers because I know they're your favorite. Aw, that they are. Thank you. You're welcome. Spit it out. I got fired today. For what? For fighting. Fighting at work. It wasn't my fault. You know, I just was standing up for myself and it got a little physical, that's all. Well, that must have been a dandy of a brouhaha. Look, Mom. I don't know how I'm gonna pay for everything without this job. I don't even know how I'm gonna pay Mary back! Oh, fuck that cow. What is she gonna do to you, sue ya? For what? This shithole? No. You will find something else, Nora. I just want better for us. Well then, I guess there's only one thing you can do. Win that damn tournament. Win that whole goddamn MM-- Mountain Man Asshole thing. You go kick everybody's goddamn ass. Hey, Nora. I have your, uh, severance check here. Cool. You're pissed at me, huh? I coulda called the law on you, you'd been in jail. You know that? As it is, Jesus is probably gonna press charges. Jesus is not gonna call the cops. Yeah, maybe. But you just can't beat the hell out of a coworker. It's never the answer. Well, you don't know how far I was pushed. I can guess. I can guess. Hurting somebody just 'cause you think you're right? That is a fast track to a criminal record, kid. Yeah, well, that'd just be one more bullshit thing that I have to fight. Why? Why does it always have to be a fight with you, Nora? Because everything is a fight, Billy! Yes, yes, you keep telling me. I question your definition of "fight"! [trainer] Rotate that hip. C'mon. Alright, good job girls. That's the day. -Thank you, Coach! -Yep. Aisha, Nora! You're up! Thanks. Alright ladies, it's game time. Two o'clock tomorrow evenin', and I'll meet you both at the Civic Center and we'll see what we see. But for right now, however, I need you to really concentrate on your structure and your footwork. Tonight, get your rest. Eight hours at least, please. Maybe more, if you can. And then, maybe a light run in the morning, a nap, and then it's show time. You girls got any questions? -No, Coach. -Alright. Take it easy. -Hey, Aisha? -Sup? Just wanted to say I'm really sorry about yesterday. Nah, you're good. I was a little too hard on you. Nah, it was good. You really showed me what it is I want. And what's that, huh? Huh? Huh? I wanna win this. You know you're gonna have to get through me, right? I'm not your damn sidekick, boo! Yeah, I know. Maybe it's you who's gonna have to get through me! Alright, honey. [trainer] Oh, hey! Save the full contact for the tournament! That was my bad, Coach. Apparently, I'm really bad at reading signals. [trainer] Yeah, well, bromancing her to death isn't working. Keep moving! [trainer] There you go. Nora! Where you at? Over here, Coach! Hey, good job today, kid. Thanks. I feel like your headspace is finally getting dialed in. That's what you need, alright? Now, I want you to go home tonight, get plenty of rest, load up on carbs, and get a lot of sleep. Alright? And please get that damn hair braided. I was just gonna like, put it in like a bun or something. No you're not. I got you covered, they're expecting you. -Tonight? -Yep. Rosheen, I don't have money to pay for this. I got ya. It's taken care of, don't worry about it. Really? -Thank you. -Aight. My little rag doll won't be so raggy! Go get 'em, girl! -[Nora] Hi. -Can I help you? Um, Rosheen sent me to get my hair done for my fight. Like, braids or something? Yeah, yeah. I know. I can get you for two hundred dollars. Oh. Rosheen said that it was "taken care of?" What do you think this is? A charity for some straggedy-ass white girl? I'm sorry there must have been some misunderstanding. I'm sorry. Oh, no, no, no, no, come back, come back! I'm just teasing you! Come on, I'm playing! Come on in. Now, damn! Don't take everything so damn personal! Come on! It's like every other word was "oh, sorry!" Like a ticking time bomb. She was gonna come back and shoot this whole place up. Y'all, stop! Okay, look. I am going to-- Oh! Oh. It's okay, it's okay. I'mma-- You know, I'mma make you look like a champion! -Oh, yeah! Girls fight like, way harder than guys! -What? Yeah, like, guys can go in, and they'll shake hands afterwards, and they're all cool but girls, sometimes, they hold a grudge. It's pretty nasty. Mhm. I know that's right. Well, Miss Champion, viola! Wow! Look at you! [hairdresser] You like it? Sorry I'm late. I had to cover a shift for this bitch that got fired. Oh, no worries, it's fine. Look like it's getting late anyway. Nobody here but the usual suspects. Oh, and the "female Rocky" over here! Um, hey look, I would tip you if I had any money, but I just lost my job. It's okay. And besides, Rosheen got you. -You aight. -Thank you. What's going on? That's that crazy ass bitch with the mother. -Oh! -Yeah! The fuck did you just say? Bitch, you heard what I said, okay? So take ya little ass outta here, alright? You not gon' do nothin'. You 'bout to do somethin'? You gon' do somethin'? That's what I thought. Get up. -Oh no, you gotta go. -Alright, alright, alright. -You do not fight in my place! -I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Sasha, what are you doi-- Hey, hey! Excuse me, Officer. Officer! -What? -Can I get my phone call now, please? I need to call someone. Some type of medical emergency? It is, actually. I need to see someone about my hand. I think I might have broke it. Sir! Sir, sir. She lyin'. She always be lyin'. She ain't got no medical emergency. I'm not lying! You can see that I might have broke my hand. Please. Doesn't look that bad. Are you serious? I have a job tomorrow! This is a very important job that I need to get to, like, in a few hours, okay? -She lyin'. -Please! She lyin.' Her coochie is the only thing that got a medical emergency, okay? The gynecologist gon' need a chin strap to deal with that offense between her legs, okay? [officer] That's good! I'm gonna tell the Captain about that one. You hear that, Nora? He's gonna tell 'em about your offense between your legs, bitch! Man, I can't believe that you came to my work and laid your hands on me, bitch. You are going to pay! This is not over, you hear me? This is on you! Yeah. Why don't you-- Why don't you go call one yo lil' Benz-drivin', BMW-havin', bougie-ass hooker workers now, huh? Call 'em for that! Call! Call 'em! Tell 'em to bail you outta jail, see how fast they come! Uh, hey, Officer! Hey! Hey! Please come here. Um, am I allowed to use, uh, like my cell phone to get a number out of my phone so that I can make my phone call? No. -Please? -No. I don't know his number by heart. That's- that'd be my one phone call and that'll be it, I promise! Goddamn, Nora! Have some respect for yourself. Some decency! You really gon' call one of them Johns who be droppin' nickels in you? He's not a J-- Uh, it's a friend of mine. Please, I just don't know his number. You ain't got no friends. Stop lyin'. You ain't got to lie now! We here together, we in jail! Look, please? Please? Look, I'll see what I can do, alright? Can you see what you can do for me, too? Laugh McGee? Here's your numbers. Use our phone, dial nine for an outside line. Thank you. Just call-- Just call him. It's fine. [answering machine] Hi! You've reached Jason, and this is my phone! Thank you so much for calling me. I hope you are doing something wonderful, and I know you are accomplishing something great! Please leave a message, and I will surely get back to you as soon as I can! Hey, uh, Jason. It's um-- I'm so sorry for calling you so late, um. Or so early. I'm not, um-- But, uh, this is Nora. Um, we met at the pharmacy. Um, and you also came to my work. Um, so uh, I needed to call, um, I'm in a little bit of a-- of a jam. Um. You know that fight tournament that I- I had told you about? Um-- [officer] Luck of the redheads. Someone's posted bail. Tell him never mind. I can't be owin' anybody like that again. [officer] 'Kay, Red. You got it. It's just that-- Oh, look! They makin' up nicknames for you here now. Here you go, Red. Rich ass Captain Save-A-Ho is here! [officer] If it makes any difference, it's not some rich ass guy. She's been shoveling all that cash in her pillowcase for years. Hm. Mary, thank you. Hm. [bell ringing] Let's go. Nora, what the hell do I say about taking this shit outside the gym? I know, it was really stupid. But it's not that bad, I swear. It's gonna be fine. Everything else okay? Yeah. Everything else is fine, yeah. It's just this, it's just the knuckles. Maybe you shouldn't do this today. Please, Rosheen, I have to do this. I don't have a choice. I have to fight today. It's really not that bad, I swear. Please. I'm messin' with you. Me, stop you from fightin'? They'd take my old ass out in the back alley before that'd happen, right? I don't know about that. I'd probably get my ass kicked. Hey, nobody is ever a hundred percent goin' into a fight. You're always gonna have a little somethin' that's really fucked up. You just gotta fight through it, right? Mhmm. Okay. Give it. Spread 'em. [announcer] Oh, ladies and gentlemen, it doesn't look good for Aisha. She's on the bottom. Oh! No, no, she's turned it around, she's on the top! She's dominating! They're back on their feet, they're back on their feet. Alright, we're goin' in for some good Muay Thai exchanges here! Good kick, good kick by Aisha! Oh! And it is over! Aisha knocked her out! [bell ringing] Nora Felix and Chase Alexander? You two are next. Five minutes. Kumite! Kumite! Great. One, two! On to the next motherfuckin' around, Nora! When are you goin' up? -Next. -Oh, okay. Okay, well, good luck. Go get 'em. Go get 'em. [trainer] You're a fighter. That's why you're here. That's why you're fightin' and why you can fight all those things you're goin' through. Something got you here! Whether it was a reason or something-- something that you're going through-- that's what brought you here and it's bringin' that out of you. You've gotta let it. Nora. Mom? [announcer] Oh! Nice Superman punch by Chase! Nora looks like she's in trouble! Aw, man, it looks like Nora's in trouble. She's gotta do something. She's gotta get up! Oh, two good kicks to the ribs. Nora's comin' back. Aw, man! Oh, there we go! Nora's got her up against the cage. Utilizing that clench! Throwing really good knees. I think she's in trouble-- Chase might be in trouble! Ow! Oh, we got an eye gauge by Chase! Woah, woah! Hey, hey, hey! Break it up, break it up, break it up, break it up! [man] Come on! We're here to win a contest, not hurt each other! Now let's go! The hell we've been through, no one can hurt you. Is Ms. Peters here yet? No, not yet. But she will be. Don't wait for her, honey. Just go! Go, go, go! Yeah, but I don't wanna leave you alone. I'll be fine. Now give me a hug. Mmm. Okay. I might lie down for a bit, anyway. Are you feeling okay? I'm fine! You go kick ass! I love you, kiddo. I love you, too, Mom. How'm I doing? Fuckin' horrible. But you're winnin'. Really? It's hard to see while you're in a fight, but everyone else can see it. Now get in there and kick her ass. You keep those hands up, you keep movin'. Alright? Spit it out. There you go. Alright. Let's go. Own it! C'mon! Nora, you can't fight your way through everything. Yeah, well, it's not like I'm trying to fight, Mom. It's just the way my life works. Nora. Mom, I take care of you, don't I? Yes. And I make sure that you're not alone for too long. And I make sure that I have food on the table every night when I get home. For you. And I make sure that I have your medicine. And I make sure that you have your scotch. And your crossword puzzles. Right? So I don't understand. Why do you keep questioning me on what I'm trying to do? And how I'm living my life? You know, I'm trying my best! This is the best I can do. No, one's giving me these things. I love you! Is that not enough? Aw, it's always been enough. You fight and fight. You're good at it. Like I was. But, there are just certain things you're gonna need to accept. -I can't talk to you. This is-- -Nora! [heavy breathing and sobbing] Came all this way. For what? It's okay-- It's not okay. It's not okay, guys! Alright, it's not too bad. You're in good shape for your next fight. Wait, I won? You keep talkin' like this and I will stop the next fight. No, wait, Rosheen. I'm sorry. I'm-- Yeah, I'm, I'm good. Alright. I'm kiddin'. You're there. Here. Let's go. You got this, kid. Breathe. Hmm. My little Nora. All grown up. But you still fit into my arms. Do you remember sleeping like this when your father... We were both just babies. All curled up into a little ball. Yeah, I remember. Oh, you were so warm. And your hair tickled my nose. You were my little angel. You saved my life back then. I saved? Mhm. Eh, when your father couldn't hack it with my ornery ass anymore, you were the only thing that kept me going. You were the only reason I had to get up every morning and carry on. Because I had to take care of you. So, I understand what you're doing for me right now. I really do. Mom? Uh-huh? Mom-- Mom, I'm not proud of what I had to do-- Your father used to say "A woman sees the world the way the woman sees it." And that way, I would know that he was drunk, and I would punch him in the goddamn neck. Yeah. Fun scene for a child to grow up in. I remember. Well, certainly toughened you up. -It's a tough world. -Yeah. It's a tough world. I think there's still a dent in the wall in the kitchen from when you threw him. Well, I had to hurt him so that he didn't hurt me first. And in the end, he still did. Sometimes, I wish I could have stepped into his shoes back then. 'Cause I would have seen how messed up he was, and I would have walked out that door, holding you in my arms. Life is a fight, maybe, Nora. But you don't have to hurt everyone around you. You can just walk away. 'Cause there, there are other ways to win. You are a beautiful, strong woman. And I am so proud of you. Oh, and I'm gonna miss you so goddamn much when I go. How the hell'd the judges not see me whoop your ass for three rounds? I had your ass, bitch! And you know it! This was my fight! You fuckin' rigged somethin' around here-- Hey! Jane, get the hell out of here! It's over! Get outta here! We won again? You're in one hell of a zone. Yeah. But you took a few good shots. Here, lemme close some of those cuts up. Here, put your head back. Hold on. Alright, hold it still. Lemme get this; I don't want it to split back open. One more fight. One more fight. We good, Rosheen. Always got my girl's corner, anyway. Oh, is that right? Rosheen, we good. She doesn't have anybody, anyway. Damn right. Babe. Be nice, man. If I was gonna lose to anybody, it'd be you, Aisha. Aisha, she's trying to get into your head. Don't listen to her. [Rosheen] Are you okay to go on? -Rosheen, I told you, I cannot quit. I gotta-- -I'm messin' with you! There ain't an ounce of quit in you. But you know damn good and well Aisha can knock people out. Or she can rip your arm out. I need you to focus and stay focused, 'cause I don't know where the hell your head's at today. It's been a weird day. The hell we've been through, no one can hurt you. Is Ms. Peters here yet? No, not yet. But don't wait for her, honey. Just, just go! Go, go, go! Mom, I don't wanna leave you alone. I will be fine. Now you give me a hug and a kiss. Mmm. Mm. I may lay down for a bit. Are you okay? Yep! Just a proud mama! You go kick ass! I love you, kiddo. I love you, too, Ma. [announcer] Alright, the two are at center. You can see the tension in their-- between their coaches. Aisha looks ready to go. She looks ready to pounce. Nora looks-- -Yeah. -Relaxed. -Alright, touch gloves. -Gettin' ready to break, touchin' gloves, and here we go! -[bell ringing] -Wait, guys! No, wait, something's happening! Yeah, it is! A fight! Now, get out there and fight! [Rosheen] C'mon, Nora! Get your hands up! C'mon! Oh shit. [announcer] Nora could be tappin' out any second. She's kind of-- She's gonna tap! C'mon, Nora, get out of her! Roll out! [announcer] She's gonna tap, she's gonna tap! C'mon, Nora! Roll out of it! Roll out of it! [announcer] What a reversal! There you go! Yes! Yes! Yes! [announcer] She's got her back turned again! [Rosheen] What are you doing? Get out there! [man] Come on now! Turn around! Nora, don't! Get out there! Go get her! Go get her! -There it is. -That's what's happening. Protect yourself! Get your arms up! No, come on! Come on, Nora, you gotta fight! [Aisha] This what you want? This what you really want? -Come on! Watch your shoulder! No! -[man] Come on! Come on! Nora, get outta that! Nora, tap! [announcer] She's gotta do something. If she doesn't do anything, this fight is over. Come on! [announcer] Her shoulder. It's about ready to go. That right arm. Is she gonna tap? [announcer] Oh my God! The arm snapped! Aw, shit! [announcer] Are the refs gonna do anything? Her arm! [announcer] She's still in the fight! Is the ref gonna stop this? -[man] He should. -[woman] I don't know if he's going to. [Aisha] Why didn't you stop it? She didn't tap. Ref, she didn't tap out! She didn't tap out! -She didn't tap. -[Aisha] Stop it! Stop it! You good? Fight! Let's go. Aight, baby, c'mon! Finish this off! Right now! What do I do? Finish it off, finish her off! She's there for the taking, baby! C'mon, go get her! Ref, stop it! What are you doing? What are you doing? Nora, you better stop. Get outta here, Nora. Nora, get the fuck out of here. [announcer] I think the ref should stop this fight. She's not even playing, not defense. Arm, again. There is the other-- Is she gonna tap? Keep breathing, keep breathing, kid! Keep breathing! C'mon Nora! Roll out of it, roll out of it! Atta girl, atta girl! Woo! Yes! Get on top! Get her knee, take her knees! Take her knee, Nora! Yes! Yes, yes, yes! [announcer] Okay, alright. Oh my God, the tables have turned here! So now, Nora has Aisha in a really tight knee lock. -Yeah, Aisha's in trouble, now. This is-- -Yes! [announcer] Is this gonna take the fight? I couldn't believe she's still going. I have not seen a fight like this in years! C'mon, baby! C'mon! Get out, get out! Get out, roll over! [announcer] Come on. This is incredible! Nora's still got her. There's-- [bell dinging] [announcer] Saved by the bell. That was an incredible first round. Unbelievable. It looked like Nora was done from the get-go. Like completely out of it, turning to her corner, turning her back. A massive amount of heart on both girls, here. What a fight! But lack of D, on both, I would say. Yeah, I would say so. There's a lot of offense, not a lot of defense. -Almost a couple submissions. -Work on the defense a bit. Way to survive that round, kid. Now, he's gonna have to pop it in now, okay? Alright. Take a deep breath. You got it. Look at me. C'mon. [doctor] Relax, relax. Breathe, breathe, breathe! Okay, right here. -Oh, shit! -[doctor] You're good! Is it in? Okay, okay. I can't keep doing this. I can't keep going. That's okay, Nora. It's okay. It's not a problem. That was a hell of a fight! No, no, you don't understand. I think my mom, she's gonna commit suicide. Nora, you-- your mom's gone. How did you know? When did you find out? Wha--? Honey, she passed away two months ago. No! No, that's not-- No! No, no, no, no! That's not, that's not possible! Hey, hey, hey. I was at the funeral, remember? And-- Yeah, and it took like, over a month for your-- for your feet to heal from the glass cuts, you remember? No! No, this can't be right! [doctor] Take a deep breath! You got it. Take it easy. Mary... Thank you. Hm. I just saw her! I just saw her this morning! I-- You guys, this isn't right! No! You feeling okay? I love you too, Mom. I saved? I'm not proud of what I had to do. You're gonna kick my ass, but I'm gonna stop this. No, no, no, please! Don't do that! Please! I can do this! Look, I know you're right! You-- It was two months ago. I remember, it was two months ago. I can do this. I'm gonna do it for her. I have to finish. I have to! Nora, it's okay. We're just gonna walk away. I gotta do this. I gotta do this for her. I gotta do this for me. I gotta do this! C'mon. You ready? Okay. I can't, I can't! I can't. I can't do this. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey! C'mon! C'mon. Okay, get up. I can't. I can't. What are you gonna do here? Are you okay to continue? One second, please. Thank you. [distorted voice] I can't hear you. [distorted voice] I can't hear you. [distorted voice] I can't hear you. [distorted voice] Can't hear you. [distorted voice] Mom, I can't hear you. I can't hear you. I'm gonna stop the fight. -No! Please! No, no, no, no! Please, no! -Come on. What do I do? What do I do? Mom, what do I do? What do I do? Fuck it! It's okay. No, fuck it! You know, you said that you never go into a fight one hundred percent, and you said that you never face life at one hundred percent because it's all just bullshit, right? You said that! I said that. Are you sure you wanna do this? No. This is stupid! Fuck! I'm fuckin' with you! Yeah, she's good! We're in. We're back! Alright. Alright. Plus, you don't wanna let down your super fan over there. Nora! No-ra! No-ra! No-ra! No-ra! No-ra! -Come on, champ. Let's go. -No-ra! No-ra! [announcer] And we're back for the second round of this fight, here, but-- -What? -Fuck you, it's over? [man] Wait, wait, what happened? What do you mean the fight's over? What do you mean the fight's over? [Rosheen] Bullshit! What the fuck? -I'm good! -Man, I told you she was good! She didn't come out of this-- [announcer] Woah! The ref! He's wavin' his hands! Hold on! Woah, woah, red corner quit. Red corner quit! The judge is yelling red corner has withdrawn. -[crowd] Boo! -Let's try here. Alright. I'm okay. We need to get her out of here. [man] She worked too hard for this. No. No, no, no, no. You can't give this to me. I didn't. I can't. It's my knee. I'm fucked up. I'm not gonna let you just quit, then. I didn't quit. I'll win next time. But you won. This was all you. Got a weird way to fuckin' do it. But this was all you. C'mere. I can't get to you. I love you. [announcer] Well, it looks like the red corner has withdrawn. Is that the official word? And it looks like Nora-- Nora has won. [Aisha] This is your moment. Fuckin' take that shit in. -[announcer] Wow. -[announcer] This fight, unbelievable. Nora! [announcer] Congratulations to the new champ! Crazy comeback, wow! Wow, what an evening. Yeah I can't believe that just happened! That's my girl! You know what? You showed up, you worked hard, you did it. No-ra! No-ra! We did it. Mm. You did all the hard work, sweetheart. I just did a lot of yellin'. -Right? -You're good at yelling, that's for sure. Hey, I know that's real. You okay, champ? Yeah, I'm all good. ¶ So give me one more day ¶ ¶ Give me one more way ¶ ¶ I swear I can handle the pain ¶ ¶ Then you're free To walk away ¶ ¶ Give me one more day ¶ ¶ Give me one more way ¶ ¶ To feel the pain I'm in ¶ ¶ Then you're free To walk away ¶ ¶ But give me one day ¶ ¶ Before you Choose to fade away ¶
