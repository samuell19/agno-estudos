Thousands of years ago, a farmer's twins had drowned and died. The father of the twin sons prayed in penance to the Gods of health, Asvini Kumarargal. Pleased by the farmer's devotion, Asvini Kumarargal appeared in front of him. They told him, "Your devotion has earned you back one of your sons." They resurrected one of the twin boys and handed him over to the farmer. They blessed the resurrected child... and gifted him two powerful idols which they brought from their world. As long as he had those idols, he'd only die of natural causes, and nothing else can kill him. The Gods blessed him with this boon and left. That boy suffered a lot to survive without his twin brother. All this was being noticed from a hideout... by a vicious evil spirit. The evil spirit realized that if he could get hold of one of the idols, then using the idol's power, it could bring the King of Demons from the demon world to Earth. It took a human form and... lured the boy by promising... to resurrect his brother in exchange for one of the idols. In order to get his brother back, he handed over one of the two powerful idols to that evil spirit. With the help of that idol, the evil spirit brought the King of Demons from the demon world to Earth. Within a few days, many evil calamities unfolded in that village. People and animals started dying, and deadly diseases began to spread. The village was hit by a famine. Brother, this place is pitch-dark. I am scared. We have made hundreds of such content for our YouTube channel. Then why are you scared as if this is new? That's true. But we did that in India. This is a whole different place. There is no mobile network here. What would we do in case of an emergency? Nothing bad will happen. Just stop overthinking and record the sounds. With video? Rahul, there are only five of us. Only if all of us record videos, we'll have enough footage for editing. Turn on the camera. Okay. It took me five minutes to reach this floor. Did Aarthi stay all by herself in such a huge mansion? No. The police recovered 15 corpses here. Aarthi's corpse is still missing. Yes, you already provided that information. How did the recovered corpse go missing? So, Aarthi's corpse must be still here. - Brother... - Listen, stop talking. Record quickly and move to the next room. Okay, Brother. Guys, I covered the staircase area and took photos. Door creak, recording one. Door creak, recording two. Door creak, recording three. I feel like I'm hearing noises everywhere in this mansion. Hey, guys! I think I found the attic on the fourth floor. Hey! Superb, man! Capture everything. What's that smell? This is an interesting sound. Guys, I'm going to record sounds, so please don't make any noise. Floor creak, recording one. Hey! I told you not to make any noise while I'm recording sounds. Brother? Brother Varun? Arjun? Brother, someone's here! Rahul... I heard someone running this way. Stop kidding. We don't have much time. Brother, I swear! When I was recording, I heard someone running. Play that recording for me. I'm very certain someone ran this way. Hear this. Hey! I told you not to make any noise while I'm recording sounds. Come on. You got scared for no reason. I heard someone run. Brother, I swear. Someone ran past this way. Rahul, the place is indeed scary. Maybe it's your imagination. Don't confuse yourself. Record the sounds and proceed to the next room. I feel like I'll go crazy before this project is over. Staircase, recording one. How did the flashlight move? Brother... Brother, I found the ritual room. Rahul... - Rahul... - Brother? - There is some painting on the wall here. - Hey, Rahul. There's a painting... Hey! Rahul... Who is it? Who... Who is it? Varun! Rahul... Rahul, come in. Rahul, are you there? Rahul, come in. Since he's recording the sounds, he might have turned off the walkie-talkie. Oh yeah, that's right. Guys, I found Aarthi's bedroom. It's on the first floor, on the west side of the mansion. Wow! Rithvika, the final video won't have my voice in it, right? No, we won't be using your voice. Perfect. I'll give a rough explanation for now. Dear viewers, we are in one of the most important rooms in this mansion. Aarthi's bedroom. According to police reports, this is where Aarthi died by suicide. The people who came to clean this mansion after the investigation... and those who came for inspection... felt and sensed many paranormal activities here. The police had mentioned that this room was full of blood stains. Hey! If you observe carefully, it looks like the blood stains are still on this table. Also, an officer who came to inspect this mansion mentioned that he could hear a lady's cry continuously. Those who came to clean this mansion also said the same thing. As per the reports, Aarthi tortured herself to death. There was a kind of supernatural ritual set up here. Something like black magic, satanic rituals. Also, Aarthi's corpse that was recovered has gone missing. It's still a mystery to this day. Maybe that's why they stopped the investigation, as it reached a dead end. Hey! This is the window on the east side of the mansion. Aarthi's presence was noticed in many of the photos and videos taken at this window. Especially in one of the videos, Aarthi can be seen running like a mad woman. And from that particular spot... Who's that?! Who's that?! Hey! I can hear Varun's voice. Grace, wait. It's dark. Let's stay together and walk out. What is he doing in the basement? Why's the flashlight flickering? It's switching to on/off mode automatically. - Ritu, make it fast. - Grace, wait for me. Grace? Grace? Grace! Grace? - Ritu! - Grace. Grace! Ritu... Where... - Arjun? - Ritu... - Arjun, you're not clear. What is it? - Don't go, Ritu. Where... - Where are you? Leave! - Arjun, I can't hear you properly. Arjun! Grace! Grace! - Ritu, where are you? - Arjun... what? - Ritu... where is everyone? - Arjun, I can't hear you properly. Arjun? Ritu, don't come here. - Grace! - There's someone here, Ritu! - Don't come here. Run, Ritu. - Grace, what? Ritu, where are you? - Arjun? - Varun and Rahul are dead. - What?! - Varun and Rahul are dead! - What do you mean, Arjun? - Ritu... Arjun! - Ritu... - Grace! Arjun! - Grace and I are in the basement. - Ritu! Grace is also dead, Ritu! Grace is dead! Where are you, Ritu?! Grace... Grace... Ritu, can you hear me?! - Ritu! - Arjun! Arjun! Ritu? - Arjun! - Ritu! Ritu! Ritu... Ritu. Don't come here. Who's that? Who's that? Arjun. - Ritu. - Arjun. Arjun! Arjun! Ritu, where are you? Arjun... Asvina. Asvina! Everyone has two lives. Everyone has two voices inside their head. Two minds. Two minds. You're as strong as your strongest mind. Okay, guys. This deal is not confirmed yet. They have selected us on a trial basis. Based on our work here, our jobs will be confirmed. For the first time, we have taken up a dark tourism project. It's a well-paid one. So, let's make sure we work this out successfully. So what exactly is our job here? Is it the same as what we did for our previous videos? No, it's a little different from the usual YouTube videos we make. The London company that hired us runs a black tourism business. Black tourism? Black tourism is all about visiting historical places where deaths and tragedies took place. In this modern age, tourists pay to stay in places like old buildings, severely haunted locations, and sites where tragic incidents took place, seeking an adventurous and thrilling experience. The mansion we are heading to is one such location. Our task is to capture sufficient footage, create a pilot film before the deadline, and submit it along with sound samples. Our previous works had impressed them greatly. So, as usual, let's execute this job perfectly and seal the deal. And tomorrow is November 11th. Arjun's birthday. We shall celebrate it together. So let's wrap up work before that. The last time we partied was during your wedding. Now we are going to have a party in London. What happened? Why are we stopping here? The car won't go past this point. We have come quite far... So it's roughly a five-kilometer walk from here. If you just stay on this road, then you'll find the mansion at the end. - Oh. - There are trees all around us. Aren't you joining us till there? I thought you could give us a tour of the mansion. No way. This is one of the darkest places in the country. I'm not brave enough to venture there. This road here gets closed off by the high tides at night, and it clears up in the morning. So, I'll meet you at sunrise. - Okay. - Yep? Good luck with your film. And do not forget to keep the keys on you for the house. Sure, I'll do that. - See you. Bye. - See you. Take care. Bye. You too. Everyone has two voices inside their head. Two minds. One that sees a bright light... and the other, an eerie darkness. Arjun? Did you forget something? Hey, Arjun. Arjun, what happened? Come on, Rahul. Are you already tired? You have a British passport, Arjun. You swiftly went past immigration. We had to sweat it out for three hours in the immigration line! Will this entire stretch of the road be submerged in water? How do we go back then? This path will be covered by the sea soon. However, during sunrise, the water will recede during low tides. By then, we will have finished our shooting. So, no need to worry. Who would buy a house here? Vikram Rajagopal... is a very successful businessman in the UK. He died in 2003. The island and the mansion on it... were purchased by him in a government auction, and he gifted it to his daughter, Aarthi Rajagopal. Aarthi is a famous archaeologist. Specializing in the archaeology of religion and ritual. In Tamil it's called, "Madhangal matrum sadangu-galin thol-porul aaraichi." Smile for the camera. An important voice that I hear inside my mind... is my wife's. Time, eras, birth, and death. Love transcends all these. Ritu's love made me believe that. This way. So, what really happened here? The reports claim that Aarthi stole an ancient cursed artifact from Kanchipuram. And nobody has been able to find that artifact till now. Some crazy rituals are believed to have taken place in the mansion. There were cryptic symbols on the wall, and the police discovered 15 brutally killed corpses inside. What about Aarthi? It is claimed that Aarthi killed herself in the mansion. Aarthi's recovered corpse is still missing. Brother, do we really need to do this project? Every YouTuber is desperately waiting for international project opportunities. We have got one! We must definitely do such projects. Remember the Demonte Colony video? Remember how viral that five-minute video got? We got 10,000 new subscribers for our channel because of it. It was the same risk in the haunted fort in Rajasthan. Our Kanchipuram video is what caught the attention of the London company. Weren't you surprised when they called us? This is what sells, and we must always be ready to take such risks. Okay, Brother. The chirping of crickets is very common in India, but not here. This is a whole new atmosphere. Oh. What's your point? Don't you like the atmosphere in India? - Then leave. - What's this? "Congratulations. We are pleased to advise that you have been admitted to the... Berlin School of Sound Engineering." Are you up for it? What about our parents? Will they agree? I'll talk to Dad. You convince Mom. The fee is 25 lakhs, Brother. We'll pay half of it and the rest... We had some money saved up for buying a house in Chennai. But now we see this as an investment for you. In my whole family, my brother is the first one to go abroad for higher studies. Come on, don't cry. Hey. Just a little more distance to cover. We'll find a lake. The mansion is right next to it. What are you reading? Aarthi's book. It's quite interesting. She says that... people die in this world, but their death is incomplete. They get trapped in a different, intermediate state. They don't even realize that they are dead. So each and every second, they try very hard to contact us. Amazing, isn't it? The way she arrived at this. Even now, some spirit around us may be listening to our conversation. Right at this very moment. Well, I don't know all that. I am quite excited. This project is a kick-start to our life in London. Weren't we waiting for this for so long? I have a special gift for you on your birthday tomorrow. What's that gift? I'll tell you tomorrow. I love you. Brother, look at that. That's one huge mansion. There is no such thing as a coincidence in this world. Everything has a reason behind it. The path we choose, our actions, and the people we meet... there is a scheme behind all this, which is beyond us. A scheme made up of our blessings and curses. Arjun! Arjun... are you okay? Well, someone... Nothing. Let's go. Guys, only a few emergency lights will work here. We only have until sunrise. By then, we'll have to take photos and record videos of all the rooms and halls here. Only one light is working. There is no mobile network here. So, all of you stay in constant touch through the walkie-talkie. Each of you, cover the room assigned to you, and then return here. - Rahul, to the attic. - Okay. - Grace, first hall, and then basement. - Okay. Rithvika, to the basement. - I'll go upstairs. - Okay, Brother. Check... Brother, how do I get to the fourth floor? This way. I'm also going there. Alright, let's get started. Arjun. Arjun! Your usual stuff. Varun? Varun? Hey, guys! I think I found the attic on the fourth floor. For those who are stuck in a loop where the curse won't stop chasing them, even a death wish is a curse. Varun! Varun! Varun, where are you?! Where? Guys, the basement looks terrific. Guys? Varun, Rahul, Grace... Can you guys hear me? I'm locked up in the basement. Arjun... Arjun, there's somebody here. I am really scared, Arjun. Please come quickly. Arjun. There's a hallway in the basement. The first door over there. Help! Help! Brother? Brother, I am really scared. Can you hear me? Brother, there's someone here... Door creak, recording one. All that we go through in darkness, while in pursuit of light, can only be realized when you observe darkness through the lens of light. Arjun! Ritu! Arjun! Ritu! Ritu! Varun! Ritu! Ritu, wake up! Oh, God... God! She's not breathing. Ritu... Ritu, please wake up. Ritu! Ritu... Ritu... Ritu... Arjun! Arjun! Arjun! Come here, Arjun. Everything's going wrong over there! Arjun! Arjun, please come with me. I don't know what's happening inside! Please come, Arjun! Arjun! Rahul and Grace are missing! What are you looking at, Arjun?! Arjun! Come with me, Arjun! Please! There's someone inside! Please come with me! Arjun, what are you looking at?! Arjun! Hey, Arjun! Arjun, come on! Arjun! Arjun! - Varun... - Rahul? Arjun, it's Rahul. People die in this world, but their death is incomplete. They get trapped in a different, intermediate state. Ra-shas-ha! Ra-shas-ha! Ra-shas-ha! Ra-shas-ha! Ritu... That other voice that I hear inside my head... is that of the demon! Ra-shas-ha! Ra-shas-ha! Ra-shas-ha! Ra-shas-ha! Ra-shas-ha! Ra-shas-ha! Ra-shas-ha! Ra-shas-ha! Ra-shas-ha! When we close our eyes in one realm, they will open in another realm. And in that realm, fear will strike you when you're alive... and fear will strike you even after death. Ra-shas-ha! Ra-shas-ha! Ra-shas-ha! Ra-shas-ha! Ra-shas-ha! My life was quite normal until yesterday. But I'm unable to figure out what my life is now. Above all that, I'm unable to realize which world I am in. I must find her. My Ritu. Ritu! Ritu! Oh, no! Ritu! Ritu! Ritu... Is she dead? Or is she alive? I can feel her presence. People die in this world, but their death is incomplete. Come with me. Please, Arjun! They get trapped in a different, intermediate state. Rahul! They don't even realize that they are dead. They try very hard to contact us. Camera? Laptop? Laptop! Ritu... I have a special gift for you on your birthday tomorrow. What's that gift? I'll tell you tomorrow. Ritu... While conducting research for my second book, I came across a story about the Asvini Gods and decided to visit Kanchipuram. The story goes like this: a farmer had twin boys who tragically drowned and lost their lives while playing. Devastated by their loss, the farmer embarked on a penance, praying to the Asvini Gods. The Asvini Gods appeared and resurrected one of the twins. They bestowed upon the revived child two powerful idols from their realm and granted him a boon. As long as he possessed those idols, he would only die of natural causes and no one else could kill him. After getting resurrected, the boy couldn't bear a life without his brother. An evil spirit, who observed all of this, assumed human form and approached the boy. He told the boy that if he gave him one of the idols, he would resurrect the boy's brother. The boy fell for it and handed over one of the idols to the evil spirit. After acquiring one of the idols from the boy, the demon created a look-alike of the boy's brother from the dark world. The boy believed that it was his brother and took the look-alike brother to his village. From the moment they set foot in the village, disaster struck. Gradually, everyone in the village fell victim to deadly diseases. Eventually, the villagers uncovered the demon's involvement through the look-alike brother. The entire village devised a plan for a grand sacrificial ritual. Through the power of the ritual, they retrieved the idol and sent the look-alike brother back to the underworld. Before being buried, the demon cursed them, proclaiming that he would return to rule the world. To prevent this curse, the villagers tied both idols together with a holy thread and buried them. According to their belief, if the tied-up idols are separated, they fear that the curse will create ...a gateway for the demon to resurrect and transcend... into the human world. We toiled hard for six months and discovered the buried idols. That was my last day in India. In order to submit basic documentation to the Archaeology Department of India, I stayed in my friend's guest house. The working room is upstairs. Call me if you need anything. I thought I would start with preliminary research before my team joined me. That's when I saw those idols. At that moment, I wasn't myself. I felt like... I was possessed. I felt as if someone else was controlling my mind. I felt strange... I couldn't distinguish between reality and imagination. There was only one idol there. One thing I knew for sure was that... I had never been this scared in my life. The next thing I remember... is being on a flight to London. Unknowingly, I took the manuscripts and the remaining idol. I must somehow translate this ancient Tamil script and publish it in my book. Until I complete this task, I am going to isolate myself. My book is about the communication between humans and the astral plane. Every second, even at this very moment... there are spirits around you that you cannot see... attempting to communicate. Most humans can't hear them, but a few individuals can hear them clearly. And my book is about those individuals. Rachel? Mark? I think somebody's here. I can't find any of my staff. I feel like I'm alone in this mansion. Every time I try to escape from here, I end up back here again without my knowledge. I... I can hear a voice. I can hear a voice. I'm so scared. I have finished translating this manuscript. If what is written here is true... then I have made a grave mistake. I have made a blunder! I keep hearing that voice. I can hear it clearly. It is trying to compel me to take my own life. Arjun! My brother is missing. Arjun... I searched everywhere. Even on the fourth floor. Rahul is missing. Help me, Arjun. Please, we must find my brother. Help me, Arjun. Let's all leave from here. Please. Arjun. Arjun, please. Ritu. Ritu! Ritu... Varun. Hey! Grace. Grace! Rahul. Please! I'm scared. Let's leave this place. Please. I'm so scared. Ritu? Ritu? Arjun! Arjun! Listen to me. Only you can stop that curse. That demon kills us in the real world... and drags us into the cursed world. In that cursed world... the demon will torture and kill us. If we die in that cursed world, then we will die permanently in the real world as well. That demon can only be controlled by stopping the curse. The sunrise on November 11th is the deadline. If the demon comes out, the boy blessed by the Asvini Gods will arise to stop it, as stated in the manuscript. If you have made it this far and reached this video, then only you can stop that curse! Please find the second idol and somehow bind both the idols together... or else the demon will bring its entire race into our world. For those who live in darkness without realizing their true identity, their world will change when they discover it. The demon world... Go to the demon world. Go to the demon world. Go to the demon world. Stop that demon and the curse. Aarthi? Find the other idol. Ritu? Is Ritu alive? She is in the cursed world, as well as your friends. In that cursed world, they are enduring unimaginable pain. If they die in this state, you can never bring them back to the real world. They will be permanently dead. How can I revive them back? You must triumph over that demon. You must go to his realm and stop the curse. Stop the curse? But how do I do that? Go to the demon world. How? How? How will I go there? Aarthi... How can I reach that realm, Aarthi? Aarthi. Aarthi. Aarthi! I need to revive all my friends. How... How do I do that? I've completed translating this manuscript. The translation... The demon takes control of the human mind. The boy cannot be killed. The boy and the demon are connected to the curse. To stop the demon, the boy must know who he truly is. Asvina! Asvina! Asvina! There is no such thing as a coincidence in this world. Ra-shas-ha! I must stop that curse. In order to revive all of them, I must stop that curse. But I only have one idol to do it. Where is the other idol? Go to the demon world. I can only stop the curse if I go to that realm. How do I go to that realm? When we close our eyes in one realm, they will open in another realm. Why am I the only one alive? I am alive. What if I die? What if I die? In order to get into the demon's head and destroy him, we must first destroy the demon inside our heads. The other idol? Ra-shas-ha! The boy cannot be killed. I must find the other idol without him noticing me. And tie both idols. How do I get the other idol without the demon seeing me? Ra-shas-ha! Why are you getting into our heads and torturing us? Rahul, be careful. Careful. Brother, please, let's leave this place. I am scared. Please. Please, somehow get me out of here. Look, you're fine. We will leave this place. I'm so scared, Brother. Don't worry. I am here. - Please... - Nothing will happen to you. - Please, Brother... - As long as I am here... Varun! Ra-shas-ha! Ra-shas-ha! Ra-shas-ha! It was me who lured you here using the other idol as bait. Only if I keep you under control in my realm... will I be able to send my entire race to your human world. Ra-shas-ha! Ra-shas-ha! Like how I'm dominating you, we demons will go to your world and dominate the human world! The demons must prevail, ensuring eternal dominance, forever reigning in every mind. Ritu... No, Ritu. Don't! No, Ritu! Don't! Ritu! Ritu, don't listen to that voice. Please, Ritu! Ritu, that's not your voice. For our sake. For... For the sake of our child, Ritu. For our child's sake, Ritu. For our child's sake. Ritu... Ritu! Don't listen to that voice, Ritu. Don't! Ritu... How did I stop her? How did I? You can only control me... but not kill me. If I have a connection with this idol, then I'm connected to you too. Ra-shas-ha! If you can get into my head and control me, then so can I. Asvina! Aarthi... Aarthi... Aarthi. Aarthi! Aarthi! Aarthi, where is the other idol? It is somewhere here. Tell me, where is it, Aarthi?! Aarthi, where is the other idol? Aarthi, where is it? Please tell me, Aarthi! Where's the other idol... Aarthi, don't let him get inside your head. Don't let him get inside your head. He cannot do anything to you! He cannot do anything to you, Aarthi. He cannot do anything to you! I cannot do anything? You think I cannot do anything? It only takes a second to destroy the demon inside our heads, and that realization is the biggest blessing humans have. Asvina! You did all this by using Aarthi. I will stop you now through Aarthi. Aarthi... Aarthi, now tell me. Where is the other idol? Aarthi! Arjun... Arjun... Arjun... Asvina! Asvina! Asvina! Asvina! Asvina. Asvina. Asvina! Asvina. Asvina! Asvina! Asvina! Asvina! No matter where these idols are buried or how well they are hidden... the demon will keep coming back to separate them. To destroy the demon forever... both these idols must be tied together. And then, I must sacrifice myself. There is light even in pitch darkness. It is up to us to stay in the darkness or move towards the light. The choice is ours! And when we make that decision, our heart will tell us what we want. But only our mind will know what is to be done. Everyone has two voices inside their head. Two minds. Two minds. Asvina! Asvina! Asvina! Asvina! Asvina! Asvina! In the end... you're as strong as your strongest mind.
