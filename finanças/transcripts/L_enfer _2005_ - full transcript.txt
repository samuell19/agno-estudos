HELL Hello, Louis. Are you alone? Thank goodness. Rolling along? Yes. How are things? Things are really good. That's good. It's good when things are good. "The Most Prolific Cannibal" "During the 19th century, the world's most prolific cannibal" "Ratu Udre Udre reportedly ate between 872 and 999 people. The Fijian chief kept a stone to record each body eaten, and these were placed along his tomb in Rakiraki, in northern Viti Levu. According to Udre Udre's son, the vicious leader ate every bit of his victims "preserving what he couldn't eat..." Hello. Can I help you? I was here the day before yesterday... evening. The reservation was under Jacquet. Jacquet, yes... I lost my earring. We left in such a rush, I didn't notice. It's silly but it means a lot to me. What room were you in? Not very high up... third, or second floor maybe... Ah yes, room 214. I'm very sorry, we didn't find your earring. It doesn't matter. Thank you. Madame, wait... We found this in the restaurant. Could it be yours? Yes, it's my husbands' lighter. Our wedding date's engraved: May 31, 1996. This must also mean a lot to you. Yes, this also means a lot. May I please speak with Celine? Who? Celine... Celine Cotie. My sister hasn't lived here for ages. Do you know how I can reach her? I have no idea. I don't even know if she's in Paris. She'd often visit our mother. Do you know anyone who can help me? I have no idea... Anne... Anne might have her address. Frederic? No, it's not Frederic. My name is Sebastein. You don't know me. I'm looking for your sister, Celine. I can't find her address. Do you have it? Sorry, I don't have her address. Wait, I think it's rue Rochambeau, number 14... It may be number 16 because... I've only been once. I don't remember. Thank you very much. You're welcome. Frederic... can you talk? It's me. Sleep well? Look! I don't get people who throw out plants. Remember how this was? Look at it now. I'll be home late. The usual? Thank you... It's funny, we kill innocent people: It's collateral damage. When they do the same: They're terrorists. Leave me alone, please. It's me. You still haven't changed your locks... Madame Alexandra! Thank you, Celine. It's me... Can you talk? I don't want you calling me anymore. Excuse me? Don't call me anymore. What's going on? Nothing. I came by to pick you up. You left the kids alone? They're sleeping. Come on then... let's go. What do you want from me? Let me read you something. "In existence, in patience" "My heart watches, my heart wilts" "A shadow follows the former me" "In patience, in existence" "I lost myself while searching" "I once was, I am still" "I was not" "I am no more" "I lost myself while searching" "In wanderings, in dreams" "Night kills me, day brings me back" "Day is lost, life grows short" "In dreams, in wanderings" "In hope, in waiting" "I dream of life, yet live in dreams" "I hide my heart, I blame my heart" "Of living no more, of dreaming still" "In waiting, in hope." That's beautiful. Sorry about this morning, I must've seemed... Don't worry Celine. You know my name? Sorry, I have to go. I have a train to catch. What's this? - I took it from the dark room. - Why? You don't know why? Why? She's one of my clients. - She's pretty. - Really? Very pretty... You have to stop. Stop what? You have to. Stop what? I don't know what you mean. Stop lying. Therefore, two centuries ago, Rationalists had to find something to replace destiny, because in a world in which God equals reason, Destiny cannot exist. On the other hand, they had to explain real events that were incomprehensible to the human mind. So they invented coincidence. Perhaps I am a bit old-fashioned, but I prefer destiny to explain the unexplainable. I find it more distinguished. It brings meaning, compared to coincidence which is a purely mechanical force. I could even accept death as long as it's part of the grand scheme of things. If it were a chapter in the great Book of Life, it would be death brought about by destiny. But how can I accept death due to a random event such as a flower pot falling on my head just as I walk under a balcony? That'd be a stupid death, devoid of reason or spiritual dimension. That is why I prefer destiny. Aesthetically speaking, it is far superior to coincidence. Destiny invites you to write, whereas an accident... What can literature gain from coincidence, other than cynical pleonastic whining about the lack of meaning in the world, which makes no difference since everything in it is rotten. How do you feel? So what am I? Destiny or coincidence? Or History? I can't live like this. Why? Because it's impossible. Because I can't. Do you remember our first time? When we hiked up the Acropolis? You remember what you said? You said, that you'd never... ever... Come on, let's go! What were you thinking about when we made love, how you're gonna leave me? Frederic... Celine are you OK? I don't know. Come here. Come see the lovely patterns. You are strange. "Longest Surviving Headless Chicken" No, Mom... No, you're imagining things. Why hazelnuts? I made a mistake. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Usually it's milk chocolate! Yes, I know. Next time, I'll bring some. "Longest Surviving Headless Chicken" "On September 10, 1945, a chicken named Mike lived for 18 months without a head. It's owner, Lloyd Holsen, fed and watered it with an eyedropper. Mike choked to death on a grain of corn in an Arizona motel." Will they ever come? I don't know, Mom. Problems? A few. 13 euros. I'm not getting out yet. Hey, I'm not a detective. Excuse me. Good evening. I'm sorry. Be my guest. Hello Professor. Professor! Hello. Sorry, I woke you up. I haven't seen you in a while. You're always sleeping. I'm an insomniac. I only sleep in trains. I suppose you're taking the 3:20 back. Yes... I'm waiting for you. Low battery Sir... Anne? What are you doing here? Are you OK? I'm making dinner. We have guests tonight. Dad's friends who are divorcing after 20 years of marriage! - You cook? - Sometimes, yeah. It's my Grandma's recipe. I'm the only one who has it. You alone? Yeah, they're out running errands. What a great dress! I have something to say... I have to talk to someone. I have to because... You're in love. You love someone? Do I know him? Who is it? I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't work or read, I can't do anything. I can't live. What's he like? I exist when he touches me, when he loves me. Only then do I exist. And afterwards I cease to exist... I fall apart. He's the only man I can look at without shame as we make love. I desperately need to be with him, to feel him... Everything hurts. He wants to leave me. Why? Maybe I ask too much of him. Too much? You can never ask for too much in love. Never. You think so? Of course. Hello, Anne. Mom, what should a girl do if her lover wants to leave her? She has to fight. Are you in love? He's married. He said he loved you? Then you must fight. I fought for Frederic once, I never regretted it. Don't ever tell him. Dad, Anne's in love with a married man. Does he love her? I know he loves me. I can feel it. I know by the way he looks at me... I know I'll never meet another man like him, never love as I love him. I want to be with him all the time. I wish he'd feel the same way but he doesn't. Dad? Nothing to say? No, I... I'm thinking. Well? It's not so simple. What if it's true love? Well then... it's even more complicated. Don't listen to him. He's forgotten what it is to be young and in love. That's enough Michale! Excuse me? You shouldn't give such advice! What if he has a family he loves? He wouldn't be involved with her. Well maybe he regrets it now. What's with you today, dear? I shouldn't have bothered you. Don't worry about it. Anne, stay! Give her back the bouquet. Smile, smile at her. Yes! Close your mouth. Look at her breasts. That's it. Look... Look at him. Look at me. That's it, good. Breathe... feel. Yes, good. That's it. Careful, Yvon... Go on! That's it! Smile. Laugh. Good! Load it. Julie? She was there. - Who? - Your wife. - Where? - At the hotel yesterday. That's the first piece of news. The second: It's over. - Julie... - It's over. Wait! Julie, please... I know you were there. She told you? Why did you do it? Why... Why did I do it? What are you doing to me? You want to know why I went there? To humiliate myself even more... humiliate myself even more. Stop. When was the last time you touched me? Stop. You don't remember? You don't think I need it? Stop! And this... this... It disgusts you? And this... Stop it! Why didn't you tell me you didn't love me anymore? But I do love you. Don't lie. Go on... Get out of here... get out! Is that what you want? You're worried about what I want? You'll leave anyway. Is that... what you want? I want you. Just get the hell out of here now. Dammit! Get out! Go. OK, come on... rehearsal. 3... 4... Action! Thanks, Olivier. I left my wife. - I... - Why? Why what? Did you leave your kids too? What's that supposed to mean? You're acting like a child. You didn't say you had kids. What's it matter? I'll tell you why it matters: My father left when I was five. You won't use me to do the same. Julie... I love you. You don't love me or anyone, only yourself. Guys like you are everywhere. I was wrong about you. You're not acting like a child, but an asshole. Hello. I'll have an Evian, please. Thank you. No sign of him. Am I late? Well, no... Actually, I just happened to be here. I'll have another Evian, please. What have you got in there? Insurance claims. To insure what? Personal injury. Want insurance? Very much so. Excuse me. Another one, please. Read that. There. "N-a-i-v-e" Naive. You are, to pay that much for water! How about a cognac instead? Why do you come here? Because the coffee is very good. I believed... I thought that... You'll miss your train. You thought what? I thought you came here because... the station is nearby. You'll miss your train. No problem, there are lots more. You were saying? Nothing. Are you sure? Yes. Celine... Excuse me. I must go. Come in, I was expecting you. Have a seat. Do you want some tea? - No. - No? I'm making some for me. Sit down, please sit down. I have to tell you something... Those alarms are awful... they go off at all hours. - I have to tell you... - Please don't... I'm ready. You really don't remember me? My name is Sebastein Floret, I was one of your father's students. You're the only one who knows why he was in prison? That's why I'm here. I have something important to tell you. It was my fault. Mom, someone's knocking... You should be asleep, naughty girl! But someone's knocking! What do you want? You're not staying, I don't want you anymore. Can I see the girls? They're sleeping. I just heard Celine... She's not asleep but you won't see her. I've missed you all. You too. Let me in. If you could be a man, just this once. Let go! Let go of the door! Go or I'll call the police! Go! Celine, lock the door! - Let me explain. - Go! I must explain to them. Their father's dead. Celine, Sophie, Anne! It's Dad. We have to talk. Open up. Don't open it. You get out of here! - You'll never see them. - Really? Never again! I must see them, do you hear? I must see them! Let go of me! I'll show you! Celine, Sophie, Anne... Open the door. Please. Open the door, please. Please... - Get the hell out! - Stop. - Go! - You'll scare them. Me? It's you who scares them! Stop it! Mom. Mom. Anne. Anne. Anne! I'm sorry. Sophie! Sophie, open the door. I know you're there. You hear me? Claire! Philippe! Dammit! I'll break down the door. Dammit! Good morning. Please. Medea Good. Please have a seat, Miss. You know the members of the jury. Unfortunately at the last minute, Professor Bache had to lead a field trip to the Acropolis. He apologizes. Society dictated that... women be virtuous and subservient to their husbands. Medea is portrayed as the perfect wife, who weaves, gives birth to children, maintains the home... Until the day Jason betrays her. Medea's jealousy is so great. In order to strike at her husband's heart, she commits the ultimate sacrifice: Slaying her own children. She knows it's the only way to truly punish him. Euripides shows that under extreme pressure, women will inevitably explode. And, as in Medea, children end up in pieces. Tragedy questions the nature of humankind, its position in the universe, its relation to forces governing existence. The character called protagonist or tragic hero suffers from misfortune that's not accidental, thus not devoid of meaning, insofar as the hero's actions and his misfortune are inextricably linked. Tragedy highlights human vulnerability whose suffering is provoked by a combination of human and divine acts. That is why tragedy's not possible in modern life. Our society has lost faith. We live in a world that has forgotten God. The best we can do is to live out a Drama. What about my newspaper! My paper and bread, you didn't fetch them. I'm sorry, I haven't been out yet. Who was that man yesterday? Nobody. Excuse me. The Fortress by Mesa Selimovic Rare Books AimC Bussard Hello Sir. I'm looking for Sebastein. Sebastein Floret. May I ask why you want him? I need to talk to him, it's rather urgent. Regarding what? - Are you his father? - No. Sebastein isn't here today. And tomorrow? We have a rather informal working arrangement. Do you have his address? I'm sorry but I don't generally disclose such information. This is Celine, I told you about her. I was in love with your father. I had waited a long time to be alone with him. The day when you entered... into his office with your mother, I finally found the courage to tell him. I got undressed. I was crazed, I didn't know what else to do. He didn't want me. He comforted me, said he understood, but that it wasn't possible... Why didn't you say anything? Because I was afraid. Afraid of who? Of teachers, parents... of lawyers, the police. After all that... it took me a while to find my place. I got married, I had a daughter... And then I left them. I've been with my friend here for a year. And it feels right. Sorry for what happened at your place... Don't worry. It's just... I thought you were in love with me. I watch too many movies... Why did she do it? Why did your mother denounce him? I don't know. Maybe out of desperation. Maybe she felt helpless... I don't know. I've an appointment with Dr Lechene. Please sit down. She'll be right with you. Miss! Accidental Death of a Sorbonne Professor Why? Why did he go there? Was it him you were talking about last time? It was him? How could you!

"At long last, Little Eagle pierced the ground with a single kick. His move realized in a single breath, he thought he'd reached perfection." It's me. You've changed. You haven't. Come in. It's so light in here! I'm changing everything. Isn't it better? I don't know... I haven't been since your wedding. That's true, I forgot. Are you alone? Pierre and I are separated. Sorry. Are these your children? I have to talk to you. You look so serious. Call Anne. I've something to tell you both. And also a favor to ask you both. Sounds of Trains & Locomotives Sleep well, Olivier Mom will be very pleased. I didn't think you'd come. Me neither... I want to see Medea's face when she... ealizes she killed her kids in vain. What? Nothing. Now I realize how much I missed you guys. Too much emotion. My heart's giving up. Come on. Hello, Mom. They came after all. They love me. He wasn't what you thought. Dad. That boy, Sebastein Floret... He admitted everything to me. You were wrong to turn him in. I don't regret a thing.
