Max, what are you doing? One second dad. Max? Max. ♪ Fa la la la la la la la la ♪ Come on, son we're gonna be late. You must be Mr. Turner. Yes. Miss D'Angelo has been expecting you. Mr. Turner, thank you so much for coming. Miss D'Angelo. Please call me Alana. My son, Max. Hi, Max. So nice to meet you both in person. Why don't you have a seat, Max and why don't you come with me? Please have a seat. So I was looking over your resume, and looks like you have a lot of experience. Yeah, I've been doing handyman work since I got out of the service. And you've moved around a lot too, right? I see Tallahassee, Reno. My family's from Florida. I got offered a job out West in a body shop and in Knoxville, I was working in a office building but I never worked to school, though. Well, as you know, we're looking for a maintenance person and I guess that means somebody that can do odd jobs and cleaning. Yeah, I knew that. I can do pretty much anything that needs to be done to maintain a building. I'm really happy that, Max will be able to attend your school tuition free. Of course. And a diploma from your prep school is gonna help him get into a good college. I realized that he's startin late, will he be able to catch up? You know, I was looking at his transcripts and I think if he works really hard, he might have to make up a couple tests, but I think he's gonna do just fine. He's a hard worker, I can tell you that. He's a lot smarter than I was at his age too. Really? Yeah. But he's got his mother's ambition. Your daughter does she take after you? Sure. I mean, in some ways, except when she's digging in her heels then I can't help but see my, my late husband's stubbornness coming through. She's a senior. So she and your son will be in the same grade. Wow. Time sure does fly, so they say. Okay, oh, boy. So this is you and I'm very sorry because it's really a mess. This is perfect it's just perfect. Okay, well then, welcome to Middleton prep, Mr. Turner. Johnny. Johnny. It's a mess. Yeah. Hey. There she is miss Instagram queen. Oh my favorite influencer. Tasha. Oh no, I ruined your blouse. Don't freak out, I got this. I'm sorry. It's okay, come on. I'm just the worst. Scissors. Doctor. I can't look. This isn't my fault, you know, it's his. Who? Lucas? Most things are, but no. That new guy you were making heart eyes at. I was not. I mean I don't blame you. Hey, do you think he's concert material? No way. Why have you met him? No. Trash. Hazardous waste. Fine, but speaking of, is this it? The year? You've been promising me you're going to help me put together a routine for the performance for exactly one decade and this my dear is your very last chance. You know I have cheer. I know we're not dancers but with the right choreography, we could really knock it out of the park. Unbelievable. Genius. Thank you. I owe it all to my friends. Babe. Right on cue. Be right there. Hot new guy's that away and no promises I'm not recruiting him, every pageant needs a prince charming. Hi. Hey, babe. Is that a new shirt? Kind of. Hi, I'm Max are you the man in charge around here? Yeah, everything all right? Oh yeah, everything's delicious, I was just wondering if you're hiring? I'm sorry mate I've got all the help I need right now. Okay, thanks. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Do you know anything about cars? A thing or two. Well, if you don't mind getting your hands dirty, I know the auto shop down the road is hiring if you're interested. Thanks. Okay go ladies. One, two, three four. Let's go ladies, let's keep the energy up. I need to see smiles. Energy is high. We need some team spirit. Let me see that spirit shine ladies. Got this. Okay, great ladies let's take five. Okay who needs to wear uniforms? Sam's looking good this year, man. Keep your eyes to yourself, bro. I got a special delivery for the principal. Hey, you look like a million bucks. Thank you. So how was your day? On a scale from one to perfect? Seven. Government's fine. There are really good books in AP lit, bio is kicking my butt and AP calc still sucks. Cheer? Nine. Lucas? 10. Really? After all that non stop texting you really like this guy? I do really like him. I don't know if he's the one or anything, not like you and dad. When your dad and I met we were about your age but it's not like I had any idea what the future would hold, so I can't say that was destiny. I don't even want to think about that, I mean, he's smart and funny. He already has all these plans with Auburn and everything. And you don't? I don't know. I just I wish dad was here. Yeah, I know, me too. Well, especially because you know, I'm so useless when it comes to AP calc. Oh, I know. Hey, that reminds me, I bet you have homework. Oh. How about if I meet you back at the house in about an hour or two? Do you want to order us a pizza? Oh, totally but you can't tell coach because I'm like only supposed to be eating carrots. Yeah, we're not going to be eating carrots tonight. We D'Angelo girls, we deserve pizza. We just survived another tough day at school. Just barely. Bye. All right, so you're 18 right? You're still in high school? You gonna finish high school? Do you talk? Is that part of the job? Only if it's intelligent. So you want a job? Yes, sir. Let me consult with my hiring manager, me. So what do you think, Nick? I don't know. It's one of those millennial kids. He seems like a good kid, he's gonna finish high school right? I don't know, he's wearing them damn skinny jeans and all. No work ethic, thinks the world owes him a living. I don't know. I don't get that from them. I say we give him a shot. You do? Yeah. You want a job kid? Yes, sir. You're not lying to me? No, sir. Here's your first victim, drop your pack. Come on. What can I do for a kid? I got a headlight out and the tires can do with some air. 2014, right. You know what this is right? Yeah. Check the tires. Be right back, let me check. Hey, man, don't you go to Middleton Prep? Yeah, it's the new transfer kid. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think I've seen you in school before. Yeah, but I must be mistaken because there's no way an MPHS kid would work at a place like this. You know what? It is him. So wow, a true blue Middleton Prep crusader. What's next for you man? Harvard, Yale? Maybe take over for his dad as head of maintenance. Your tires are fine. Gonna have to order that bulb for you guys, hey? Kid, where you going? Hi. Hi. Do you work here? Yeah, yes. What can I do for you? I think I need some oil. Sure. Right away. Would you mind popping the hood for me? Hey, babe. Hi. What was that? What was what? I saw you messing with him. Oh, Sam. No, some people have to work for a living. Do you want to say that a little louder? Okay, look, I know that. Okay, honestly, I think it was really nice of your mom to give his dad a chance. What's that supposed to mean? The new janitor, he's a crazy army vet, he's got scrambled eggs for brains. Babe. What do I owe you? Oh, don't worry about it. It's fine. I'm sorry, about him. Who? Your boyfriend? Yeah. He tries to be funny, but he just doesn't think sometimes. He's right about your mom giving my dad a shot. Trust me, my mom doesn't do favors, so I'm sure your dad is great at his job. I'm sure, you're great at this too. So, you like Christmas? What? Oh my gosh, I forgot about that. ♪ Fa la la la la la la la la ♪ Yeah, okay that's embarrassing. You always practice to Christmas music? Maybe. Maybe it's just the best music for any occasion. You know, I mean, I think it was a time and a place. I think that time is December 1st and not a second before. Oh, you're one of those people, how very narrow minded. Me? What you're proposing is anarchy. We allow Deck the halls in September and what's next? Fireworks in March? Pumpkin spice lattes in April? Is that what you want? Yes. Kid. So I'll see you in school. Yeah. What's your name by the way? Max. I'm glad you're here. I'm Sam. Everyone knows who you are. Mr. Turner. Oh Ms. D'Angelo. What can I do for you? This is impressive. Well, it's good common sense. I think you get a lot more done in a organized workspace, right? Yeah. I've always felt that way too. What are you working on? It's a bandsaw trying to get it running. I got this thing, if something's broke, you should try to fix it if you get a chance. I took shop class in here. You took shop? Yes, I took shop. One of the first girls to take shop at the school actually, many moons ago. This kind of reminds me of the bandsaw I used on my final assignment you know, it was a little wooden box. I still have it. I'd like to see that. Okay, maybe someday, huh? Shop, yet one more thing that's gone from our generation, you know? There's some things you thought would never go away, TV, Max, if he's watching anything, he's streaming it on his phone. I know, same exact thing with Samantha but I try to keep an open eye about the future because if you're going to serve the students best then you have to embrace new technology. I just wish we had the funding to stay on top of it all. Kids sure keep you young, don't they? When they don't make you feel really old you mean. Yeah, that's for sure. Is this yours? Yeah. You're taking French? I always wanted to go to France, haven't made it yet but I will someday. Is it working? You should use that on your son's phone. Right. Now these antigens are critical in determining whether an individual's body will accept a transfusion or if an immune response will be triggered, causing the body to attack and refuse the foreign blood. Okay, now for the fun part if you would please with your partners carefully use the lancets on your fingers and apply the blood to the test card. Okay, following the direction to check for agglutination. Finger please. Ow. You're such a baby. Okay, so are you ready? Uh-uh, no chance. No way. Okay. Here, I have no idea what I'm looking at. Um, so you have squiggly blood and Max also squiggly. Okay, I think I get it. So, this is what says the type. Well, things seems to be going particularly well over here Mr. Masterson. Care to tell us all what type of blood you have? Miss D'Angelo? I think he's B negative. I don't know, these all look the same. Well, that would be unusual but it is possible. Wait so you mean like me and him. Well look at that a B negative trio over here, just goes to show although we're all different, we can be very much the same. Now as you will see the agglutination is defined by the presence of antibodies. But the grant was not supposed to be reevaluated for another two years. You know, our programs are... Yes, but... No, that's not gonna happen. I'm definitely not going to be raising tuition because I made a commitment to the students and their families. Fine. I look forward to speaking with him. Is everything okay? Another day another disaster. Thank you. This will help. Melody, can I ask you a question? You went to school here. Did it matter? Did it make a difference? Absolutely. I was lucky. I had parents who sacrificed everything they had so that I could have the best education in a school where people actually cared and that's what I got. One more thing, you've been given lots of opportunities to work other places, why did you come back? Same reason you did. This place is special. Thank you. Okay everybody from the top. Ready? And sway, sway, sway. Yeah, put your shoulder into it and lean. What are you doing? Help me, somebody? Oh, the sights and sounds of creative chaos. Hey, Mr. Bensen. How's my favorite drama teacher. I'm the only drama teacher. How are rehearsals going? We've got tons more work to do but it's coming together. You still have time. Now listen, if you need any help from us just let me know. Can you give us better rhythm? Tasha, I have full confidence in you, it's gonna be great. Spectacular. Even better. Thanks, Mr. Bensen. Break a leg. Hey, careful on that ladder. You know what? Come to think of it, don't break anything at all. Nothing. Okay, you know what just take five everybody, just take a break. Hey, what's going on? These kids. What's up? They sent me in to ask to you to keep down. Oh, are the arts inconveniencing the athletes? Tasha. Look, I know I'm acting jealous but I don't get it. You should be in here, you love Christmas. This is our final holiday show and with just a little bit of help from you we can make it the best one ever. I need to get back to practice. What's the point you kick, you jump. You sing, you dance. We make people feel things. So do I. Not as much as you could. Just, think about it? Okay. Okay, everybody back to work. Let's get started people. No. Well, the good news is, is that all you need is a donut. Like sprinkled or glazed? Bad news is that you don't have one. Okay. And I'd put one from the shop on it for you but I'm really not supposed to that kind of stuff when Nick's out of town and besides a donuts not going to fix your real problem which is you got a nail in there, so. Right. So I suggest that you leave it with me and my dad and I can patch it and we'll drop it off later. Are you trying to be nice? Oh, no, we'll definitely send you the bill. Oh, good. What are you working on? Oh, it's just this dance. Can I see? Sure. It's not for cheer? No. It's for Tasha. It's the holiday concert, she's obsessed with it and wants me to help. It's big words coming from you Miss Christmas 2020. Okay. I love watching the show, I'm just not sure what I want to be doing or spending my time on. My senior year and all feels so, final like you have to have it all figured out. Yeah, I know what you mean, my dad keeps telling me about how he was already in basic training at my age and how he'd met my mom. My parents were high school sweethearts too. It feels like a lot of pressure. I mean, not that she is pressuring me. My mom is really cool. My dad died from a heart attack eight years ago. Sorry. Thanks. So, no doughnuts. Nope. Seems cool, the routine. Really? Hey, you Samantha? Jason? Yeah. Take your time no rush. Here, just text me when you're on your way with the car Okay. See you later. See you. Come on dad. Hi, come in. Thanks again. Don't worry about it. Hi, Mr. Turner. I'm Sam. I've seen you at school. Hi, you guys. Hey, they just dropped off my car. It's nice to see you outside of work Johnny. Pleasures all mine mam. And Max, thank you so much for helping Sam out with her car. No problem. Are you getting settled in okay? Oh, yeah. Great. Thanks, Mrs. D'Angelo. Good. Do you wanna stay for a minute? Have some coffee or tea? - We're fine. - Sure. Why not? Actually, I'm really glad that you stopped by Johnny, I wanted to talk to you about something having to do with the holiday show. Oh. Mom. Samantha. Anyway, I was thinking that maybe this year, we should make it a fundraiser. We should get the best and the brightest that Middleton has to offer, put them on that stage, show the world who we are and why our school means so much to our community. We can sell tickets and ask for donations and I was hoping that maybe you could lend your expertise and build the sets because if you can make the auditorium look half as great as your made work room, we're going to be great. Say no more I can take care of it maybe Max will help me. Sure. Fantastic. Thank you so much. Bye. I'll help too. Oh, honey. No, I've been thinking about it and Tasha's been bugging me. I think that I could choreograph some of the songs and make it really cool. Well, I'm sure you could, but it's gonna be a lot of work and mostly after school, so what about cheer? I can do both. I don't have to be at every practice. Okay, well, if you're sure. Yes, I am. Okay. He's cute. Mom. Lucas, bro come on. Let's go. Get your head in the game bro. Excuse me, has anybody seen my daughter? No. Come on. I can't move. Well, maybe this will help. Okay. I think this is what a zombie feels like. I need the caffeine. Oh, honey your schedule has gotten completely out of control. I'm handling it. Look at yourself, you're exhausted. And you're not? I'm handling it. Touche. Is it really bad, that we might actually have to close the school? Oh, honey, I'm not sure. Some days I feel I've got the resources in place and other days I feel like I don't. I'm just working very hard to get that funding to come through. I know, you are. You're great at this stuff. Thanks. Just goes to show ya, how unpredictable life can be. That's what's great about it, right? Yeah. I don't know what I would do without this place. Well, you could always date. Is that something you think about? I don't know, maybe. I mean, no one would ever be dad but. No, obviously nobody could ever be dad. That doesn't mean you shouldn't be happy. Sometimes I think you're kind of a genius. Hey, I can give very sound advice. Apparently so. And guess what? So can I, because even though it's been a really long time since I've been on a date, I seem to recall that it's not so smart to go out with more than one guy at a time. I mean, I don't know why, but they seem to get a little prickly about that kind of thing. Duly noted. ♪ Rudolph the red-nosed Reindeer ♪ ♪ Had a very shiny nose ♪ ♪ And if you ever saw him ♪ ♪ You would even say it glows ♪ Hey, kid 12 o'clock. I know that look, you got this. Hey. Hi. I wanted to talk to you for a second. Oh, wait. The Christmas spirit is telling me to go hang these inside. I wanted to ask, are you jealous? What do you mean? You know, of me and Lucas. You're asking me if I'm jealous that you two are dating? Yeah. I mean, he's cute, Sam, but he's not really my type. Come on. What makes you ask? You know, we've been spending a lot of time together, working on the concert and I just wonder if that seems weird to you? What would be weird is if you were dating someone that you didn't actually like. I do. I mean, I'm not. I mean, I am dating someone that I do like. Okay, well then nothings weird. And you're not jealous? No. Okay, good. That's all I wanted to know. I have been thinking about letting the air out of your tires Really? Slashing them altogether, maybe. You know, you could keep me company while I worked on it. This wouldn't be out of jealousy, you understand though? No, of course not. It's just good business. Right. Hey, Nick. I'm taking a break. Yeah. Don't worry about it. Take as much time as you want. Not like you got a job or anything. So, you've lived a lot of places like a lot, a lot. What do you think of Middleton? Middleton? It's small, but it's kind of nice. Yeah. Everyone's in your business. If they care enough to be in your business. They're bored. You're the queen of this town aren't you? My mom is the queen. Which makes you the princess, Princess of Middleton. I could see why you wouldn't want to give that up. Everyone's acting like it's wrong to like where you come from. I, mean my life isn't perfect, but I know how lucky I am. I've been loved in this place by all these people. Why should I have to choose? Like, I could go to New York and study dance or fashion and still make sure that I'm right here every Fall and every Christmas because this is home. Do you have a place like that? That feels like home? No. I'm starting to. Max. Hi, Mr. Turner. Max, do you want to help me unload the truck? Uh, sure. Uh, see you. See you. Great timing dad. Told you that's not a good idea, Max. What idea? That girl. She's different than guys like us, Max. Oh, you mean she's too good for me? Now, Max. No, it's fine. I get it. No, it would be different if she really liked you. What makes you think that's impossible? Girls like that, they have expectations. You know when she gets out of high school, she's probably gonna go to Europe and then come back and go to university and you're gonna be working your way through community college son. You're wasting your time. There's no future with her. I'd settle for the present dad. Did you ever wonder that maybe she's using you to get her boyfriend jealous? She's not mom. I gotta get back to work. Max. Ow. I didn't poke you. Ow. Yikes. Exit stage right. Tasha. Peace. Hey. Figured you'd be here? Yeah. I think Kelsey's been trying to call you or she's gonna call you. Shoot. She's probably mad that I'm late. Actually, she wanted me to tell you, you're off the squad, Sam. What? Yeah. Sorry. Thanks. Is that it? You're supposed to be at practice on the sidelines. You're supposed to be with me. What the hell is all of this? My mom asked me. I know your mom didn't ask you to quit cheer. Don't even try that. We had a plan. Have you even submitted your Auburn application yet? Lucas. I'm just not as sure as you about where I want to go. Sure. Maybe you don't want to go anywhere. You know, maybe you just want to stay here with him. Come on Sam. We're the same. Okay, we come from the same place. We're going the same direction, that's the way it's supposed to be I don't know where I'm going. I just... I just know that it's not with you anymore. We'll see. Office of the Dean, hello. Johnny, I'm glad you're here. Have a seat. I want to show you something. Is this the uh? Yes, my shop class final project. Wow. Good craftsmanship, the finish. It's amazing. I was pretty proud of it. Should be. Just wait till you see what's in it. You shouldn't have done this. Well don't get too excited. I mean it's not a promotion or anything, it's a different job title. It's very kind of you to do this but Miss D'Angelo, Alana I don't know how long I'm gonna be hanging around after Max graduates. I got plans to pursue... Excuse me. It's not a good time. Mrs. D'Angelo it's the hospital. It's about Sam. There's been some kind of accident. What? They're holding on line two. This is Alana, I'm Sam's mother. My blood type is O negative. What's going on? I'm on my way. She's lost a lot of blood. She's critical. Alana, look at me you're going to be alright. We're going to the hospital. We're going to the hospital. Forward her calls to my cellphone. Let's go, I'll drive. Yeah. Excuse me, I'm looking for my daughter. She was just brought in. Okay, mam what is your daughter's name? Samantha D'Angelo. Samantha D'Angelo. I'm sure she was brought here. Okay, she was just taken down to surgery. Surgery? If you could please just take a seat mam. She can't be in surgery. I'm her mother. Don't you need my permission? Ma'am, we're doing everything we can. I want to see my daughter. I understand ma'am, if you could please take. No, I want to see her. Alana. Alana she's 18. Johnny I want to see my daughter. She's 18. She's not a minor anymore but it's a good thing that the doctors operate. I just want to look at her. They're doing their job. It's a good thing. Alana look. I just want to see her. Listen to me. There's nothing we can do now. We have to wait for the doctors to tell us what's going on. Okay? It's going to be all right. We just have to wait a little bit. Hang on. Wait don't go, please. I'm not going. I'm not going. I'm gonna get you a cup of, what do you want? Tea. I'll be right back. Thank you. I'll be right back. Come on, Max. Pick up. Yeah, it's Nick. Yeah, he's here. I'll tell him. Max, it's your dad he's been trying to call you. I know. There's an accident, Samantha's in the hospital. Go. Get. Mr. and Mrs. D'Angelo. I'm Samantha's mother. I work with her at the school. A friend. Mrs. D'Angelo, all in all, your daughter was very fortunate we were able to stop the internal bleeding and she stabilized. I still don't understand. Both of Samantha's kidneys were severely damaged in the accident. The left was punctured by a broken rib and had to be removed. The right was lacerated, but we've attempted to repair it. But she's gonna be okay, right? She's young, she's healthy, and we're adding her to the transplant list. She doesn't have to be on a list. If she needs a kidney, I can give her one of mine. I understand your eagerness, Mrs. D'Angelo, but it's a little more complicated than that. There are several factors that make you ineligible as a donor. I'm her mother. For starters, you're not Samantha's blood type. What are you saying? These procedures are more common than people think and I'd like to start looking for a candidate who would be the best possible match to give Samantha a kidney and I'd like to start that process as soon as possible with your permission. I just can't believe it. I know I should be grateful and I am, I'm so grateful that nobody else got hurt. I could have lost my little girl. Thank God it didn't go that way but these doctors, they're gonna figure it out, I know it. I know. I believe that too. Alana, maybe you should get some rest or could I get you something? Thank you. You've done so much for me today and I'm so grateful to you and Max for being there. Just doing my job, ma'am. I'm really glad that I could be here to help you through this and I know what you're going through. Thank you. And I really appreciate you giving me a break and listen I'm gonna go find Max, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Max, get your stuff, we're leaving son, come on. Go if you want, I'm staying till she wakes up. Max, don't be a fool. She's here because of me dad, I'm staying till Sam wakes up. You listen to me, Samantha G. We're gonna get you what you need. We're gonna find you that kidney, coz we're gonna figure this out. I promise you honey. We're gonna figure it out. Hi. Hi. Thank you. Max? Lucas. Miss D'Angelo. What a nice surprise. I'm so sorry. I meant to come sooner. Don't be silly. Sam would be so happy to see you. How's she doing? Well, we haven't found a donor yet. The doctors want to keep her here for observation but you know what? Her spirits are high. She's stable, so. A donor? Tasha told me that she needs a kidney, right? We're praying. Come on. I'll bring you to her room. And there's like the rainbow thing, coming out of his, I don't know what that is. Oh, no. Hi, girls. Hey. Sorry, to interrupt. Oh, you're fine. Mrs. D'Angelo. Everything looks good today. Good to hear. Oh, no, you don't have to. We'll let them catch up, right? Yeah. We'll do that. Hey, I brought you some flowers. I know they're kind of lame. I love poinsettias. You know where to find me. Thanks. - So, I'm sorry. - So I was thinking that. You go ahead. I just wanted to say, I'm sorry that I wasn't honest with you. I should have told you how I was feeling a long time ago. You were always so upfront about your plans and I should have respected that and talked to you. Yeah, but you were right, you know. I've been a real jerk and... Can I sit? I've been thinking a lot about that day in math class. What? I wasn't paying attention and I know that I didn't pay enough attention to you and to a lot of stuff. We have the same blood type, Sam. So. Lucas I made up my mind about this. You know, I want to do this and it doesn't have anything to do with us. It doesn't have to be a big deal. No, it is, it's a huge deal. Are you sure? I am. Thank you. First of the year, sir? That's right. Oh, this is uh, this is just about perfect. No I really appreciate this. It's an ideal opportunity. The paperwork, yes, I can get that to you by the end of the day and you know... Thank you sir. Thank you very much. You're not serious are you? Max. this is a great job. It's right near grandma, I already checked you can finish the school year there. Max, you always love Florida. I never liked Florida dad. Dad I hated, every stupid time you made us move to some crappy new town because you're too scared to just... Look that's not gonna be me. Okay. I'm not going. Max, you're gonna go if I tell you to go. I'm 18 now dad, you can't make me do anything anymore. You can't stop me either. And the next thing I know, I get a call from the hospital, saying I have to come down and sign some forms, because some quacks want to carve up my son, who by the way has a full ride scholarship to a prestigious university. It's not gonna happen. There must be some kind of a misunderstanding because my daughter would never ask Lucas to do anything like this. She didn't. It doesn't matter who asked who the point is. The point is, no one is touching my son. She needs my help. And it's very kind of you to want to help dear, but there must be a less risky way. No one is signing anything. He's been working his whole life toward getting this scholarship as a mother I know you understand. I do. See, I knew it would be all right. Please let us know if there's anything else we can do to help. Come on. It's okay. I'm sorry. It's okay. It's okay. I'm gonna go grab a cup of coffee. Mom? Samantha. Hey, you're awake. Where's my mom? She's here, she just stepped out but she'll be right back. Here, your mouth is dry from the anesthesia. What happened? Do you remember going down to surgery for your transplant? Well, that's what happened. The surgery went well, the doctor's pleased. She said you're gonna be just fine. When can I go home? Usually about a week. It depends on how you feel. What about Lucas? Who? My donor? The one who gave me his kidney? Oh, I understand the young man is resting you, he's in the ICU. What? Uh uh uh. Easy, easy. You're not supposed to move, okay? Can I see him? In due time, okay? Right now let's just focus on getting some rest, okay? I think it's sweet. I think it's the most beautiful gift you can get from somebody that loves you. He's in here. Hold on. I'm sorry, family only, no visitors. This is as far as we can go. Why? What's going on? Now is not a good time. Wait. Why can't I see him? Max Turner, right? Max. He's in a coma. He's gonna be okay. He just needs to sleep a little longer. Maybe come back a little later. Yeah. - Hey, don't worry. - Okay. Max was generous enough to donate his kidney. He did what? Johnny. I'm here. I'm here, it's okay. You know that blood type, that both our kids got, doctor says it's pretty rare. I don't get it, how those two found each other. I'm so sorry. It's okay. I get it now. For a second I thought he did it just to spite me because I was planning on leaving Well, whatever happens, I hope you both stay. William Penn had visited Germany in the 1671 and 1677 with the view of obtaining settlers, of his European American colony in Pennsylvania. No change. Mom. Mm. How do you know when you're in love? Well, love is when you want what's best for someone. Yeah, but that's not the same as being in love. No, it's not and it's definitely not that simple because it's easy to want what's best for someone when you really like each other a lot and you know, you think they're perfect but there's no such thing as perfection, right? So eventually they're going to disappoint you and hurt you and you'll probably hurt them. So I guess I'd say that love is when... Love is when you see somebody completely for who they are, the good parts and the bad parts and you still want to be on their team. You still want to stand alongside them as you face the unpredictable world together. I'm glad you're on my team. I'm glad you're on mine. I don't understand why advanced ticket sales are so low. We've been marketing all the usual places, posters at the library, grocery store, an email blast at alumni network. Email? Maybe we call the Gazette and have them send a reporter over. Sorry, a cute video. What if we target bigger donors? Oh, Miss D'Angelo looks like the time has finally come. I am very pleased to see how quickly you've been recovering post surgery. I think it's about time that we send you home. Thank god. You'll be back in time for the show. Congratulations. What about Max? He hasn't shown any marked improvement. It looks like it could be more serious than we thought. Okay, I'm just gonna take these to the car. Honey. Look at me. I know you're upset. We all are. Your recovery is such a blessing though honey. This is all my fault. I don't want you thinking that way. I think maybe Max needs to be reminded that it's Christmas. What do you think? Hey, it's me. I'm just here to tell you that you have to wake up because it's almost Christmas and Christmas in Middleton is amazing. It's beautiful and everybody has their lights up. Oh and Tasha says at the concert is looking awesome and it might even snow. My mom is talking about having you guys over for Christmas dinner, which would be nice. Anyway, everybody's been working really hard, so you need to wake up coz you're gonna be really, really sad if you miss it. Max, I don't know why you did this or why this is happening. It's not fair. It's so wrong, that things have been so hard for you and your family and that I've been so lucky and now I'm here and I don't know where you are but I know that I'm not the only one who needs you. You have to come back. You did an amazing thing for me but I need you to do one more thing. Just wake up and then I promise I'll be on your side against the world because you see me and I see you. I know that you're still in there. Just come back. There's a lot of people who love you, Max. Please. Wait, Sam. Sam. Chloe, Dr. Knowles. That's too loud. I don't care. Hey. Yeah. I'm glad you're here. Me too. That's great, other eye, it's good. Looking good. Good. I See. Thank you. Here, let me fix your pillow. Oh, Johnny really? Dad. Put your head back. Ah, that's much better. Thank you. Hey, girls. Hi. Do you want to take a picture. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Yay. That looks good. Thanks, Mrs. D. Wait a second. You have 8000 followers. Oh, that's nothing, Sam has 10 times as many as me. Do you really? Mm hmm. I guess, why? What's the big deal? Ticket sales for the Christmas concert are really slow. What? That's crazy. Sam. Let's make a post. Oh, whoa, whoa, let me fix my hair. Not to worry Mrs. D, we can get everyone with a phone in 40 miles to come. Let's do this. Ready, you guys? Okay, all of us? Okay. Okay. Ready? 1, 2, 3. Hey everyone, remember my friend Max? Well, guess what? He just woke up and we all only want one thing for Christmas this year. MAX, TASHA AND SAMANTHA: Come to the holiday concert at Middleton Prep. Yay, aw. Excellent. I saw that Max. Let's see what we have here. Okay, perfect. All right. Let's see what happens. Hi everyone, remember my friend Max? Well, guess what? He's awake and we all only want one thing for Christmas this year. MAX, TASHA AND SAMANTHA: Come to the holiday show at Middleton Prep. Support Middleton Prep. Middleton Prep. Hey, guys. Come to Middleton Prep. Merry Christmas. You are set. Oh my gosh, mom. How many views? Look. That's incredible. I'm so proud of you? Who's ready to finally go home? You ready? Yeah, let's go home. Okay, loser empties the bed pan. See you at the show. Max, I got to say something. Oh, dad please, please stop. And I'd appreciate it if you'd listen and let me say it. Now look, I'm not mad at you for what you did. I'm not happy about the way I found out But Max, I understand. You really love Samantha and that might be the most important thing in life son. I think I was so busy making plans for you, I didn't realize that it was your turn to make your own plans. So if you want to take a trip around the world, go to college, or I don't know, join the circus become a magician. That's not a thing dad. Max, what I'm trying to say is, no matter what you decide to do with your life. I'm your father, and I'll always be there. I think... I think I'd like to just try staying in one place for a while, preferably here. I mean, you're not really gonna move back to Florida are you? You know, Sam says her mom wants to cook us Christmas dinner. Where am I gonna go huh? I got a great job here. Director of maintenance in a private high school. Your deal my son. You know dad, if you really wanted to, you could be a circus magician. Just deal the cards wiseguy, I'll do the jokes. It's freezing, where's this snow everybody's talking about? Hurry, or we're gonna miss the beginning. Take it easy on the stairs. Thanks dad. We're not late are we? No, right on time. May I? Oh sure. Mom, look. I told you a Christmas here was the best. Everybody ready? Can you all act like you actually care about Christmas, please? Where's Melody? Here we go. Ladies and gentlemen, we have one more very special number for you all but before we do, I'd like to remind you of the reason we're all here, to support Middleton Prep. Also, I'd like to welcome to the stage, an amazing woman and a total boss, our principal, Mrs. Alana D'Angelo. Thank you so much Tasha, you're so good. Thank you to our students and our faculty, they worked so hard to bring this show to life. So, tonight is very special but I was wondering if you knew why it's so special. It's because of all of you, your presence here shows your commitment and your support for our school and our incredible students and I just thank you so much from my heart. As most of you know, my daughter Samantha and I have been through a rough few weeks, and I've been a little preoccupied about the future. Actually, I've been quite terrified about the future. And then, the most wonderful thing happened. In the true spirit of Christmas, we received the most precious gift and I realized something, I'm just so grateful to be here now, to have my beautiful daughter and to have all of you, our family. I know for a fact that life can be very, very unpredictable but as my child pointed out to me not that long ago, that's what makes it so great. So whatever happens tonight or the rest of the year, I just want to say thank you and Merry Christmas. ♪ The bells of Christmas time ♪ ♪ Are ringing merry ♪ ♪ Joyful songs ♪ ♪ Of caroling ♪ ♪ Sang just for you ♪ ♪ And for me ♪ ♪ Time for a Christmas song ♪ ♪ Oh, won't you sing along ♪ ♪ Bring in the joy of the holiday ♪ ♪ This our Christmas song ♪ ♪ We hope you sing a long ♪ Did you choreograph this?

Thank you. Young man, you're gonna be work bright and early Monday morning, right? Of course. Better not be or I'll give you a kidney shot. Heal up, your jobs waiting for you. Thanks Nick. Merry Christmas guys. Merry Christmas. Sam, I'm uh. My mom told me what happened. It's fine. Thanks. Welcome back man. Hey. You were amazing. All thanks to you girl but some clown stepped on the hem of my dress and ripped it. I can fix it. Okay, I'm texting you tomorrow. Okay. Ticket sales were great, but. No. Please, Melody no business talk tonight. Mrs. D'Angelo, this is my auntie Iris, the CEO of Com Tech, Singapore. Mrs D'Angelo, it is so nice to meet you. I've heard so much about you from my nice. Thank you. I feel honored. Yes, but nonetheless, I wasn't expecting to see this kind of performance here tonight from being from a small town, you run a very impressive school Mrs. D'Angelo. Please, call me Alana. But your technology is disgraceful, a choir of that caliber deserves the best sound and lighting systems and updated facilities. Melody tells me that your classrooms aren't even equipped with tablets and smart boards. That's true, very sad but true. We do the best with what we have, however. Beginning next semester, Com tech will be outfitting this entire school with the finest technology our company can provide. Consider it a holiday donation to support the work you do. Oh, auntie. Thank you so much. I'll be in touch to arrange the details. Thank you. Thank you! Can you believe this? It's amazing. I know. This is the answer to our prayer. This is incredible. You worked so hard for this. We all worked so hard, are you kidding? Oh, we could do all sorts of new technology. It would be different now. Yes, but we could have like an interesting kind of Come on. Let's go. So, I was thinking that we could add a couple workbenches right over here and I don't know a couple desks or something and, you know, just make it more useful that way. Your French book, bet you haven't had any time to practice at all with everything that's been going on. What was that? Would you do me the honor of having dinner with me sometime Alana? Yes, I'd love to. Would you like to come watch the snow with me? Oh, I forgot something, one second. Okay. Oh no. What? No, I don't think either one of us will be dancing anytime soon. Wow, you're obsessed with choreography, who said anything about dancing? Come on, it's just a few steps. I'll help. I got it. I got it. I got it. Is that okay? I got you. Well, since we're here, maybe a little dancing. I can do some swaying. I'll take it. Very nice. Thank you. Not bad, this Christmas. Max. You were saying. ♪ Fa la la la la la la la la ♪
