He should be here by now. We've still got a few minutes left. Yeah. If they come at all. Oh, they'll come, they'll come. They've held him for six months already. They saved his life. That scores them a few points. The next time they want something from us, they'll be sure to let us know. Yeah, I suppose so. Er... Mr Haller, they're here. - Sergeant? - Sir? Okay. Go pick him up. Dr Martino? Yes. It's good to be back, at last. Um... my name's Finchley. I'm FBI. This is Mr Haller, State Department. How do you do? Oh, very well, thank you. And you? Er... Dr Martino, your car is right over here. Dr Martino, I think you know that we're gonna have to debrief you before we can let you go back to the United States. We'll let you be a guest at the Mission and start the interview the minute we get there, okay? Will that take long? That's gonna depend on you, Dr Martino. I'm Sean Rogers. FBI. It, er... feels wonderful to be back. Yes, I... Yes, I should think so. After what they must have done to you... Dr Martino is just saying what he feels is expected of him, Mr Haller. I rather doubt he feels wonderful about anything. Well, you're very blunt. Aren't you, Mr Rogers? Don't let me upset you. I know what I look like. If it will help you, you should know that I, for one, am quite used to it. Look, Dr Martino, I'm sure you realise there are a certain number of matters that we have to confirm. I understand. I'm sure they asked you a great many questions about our security. Of course. Four of the last six months seem to have been nothing else. Now, you were in Leipzig the whole time, weren't you? Till this week. They moved me for a few days, to East Berlin. So Kothu, that's Dr Kubija Kothu, was in charge of your case? The medical side, yes. Colonel Azarin was really in charge of it all. You mean that General Stürmer didn't have charge of your interrogation? Leave the questions for now, Finchley. Dr Martino must be extremely tired. Sergeant, follow me. Right this way, Dr Martino. Mr Haller, are you checking in with your office now? Yes, right away. Okay, we'd like to start this interview in about an hour. You want to come to my office then? Yes, indeed. There's been a change of plan. I think you're too tired to go through an interrogation. Please come with me. Someone's preparing a room for you now. You'll find a bell by the bed if you should need anything during the night. My advice is to get as much sleep as possible. Tomorrow's going to be a tough day. Good night, Dr Martino. You don't open that door for anything. Not if he says he's dying. He don't get out, and nobody, but nobody, gets in. Yes, sir. Why? First, we don't know who he is. Second, we don't know what he is. And third, we do know who sent him. I need an emergency team down here as fast as possible. A man who knows about making mechanical devices. I want a surveillance device expert, a psychologist. I want these key men tonight or tomorrow morning. I want the authorisations now so there'll be no red tape. Sean, you may be wrong. - We can't treat him as though he was... - I'm sorry, sir. I can't risk moving him. I got him over here and into a cell. God only knows what he's after or what he can do. Did Martino come over tonight or didn't he? I don't know. But we knew he was going to be different. I was never told that Azarin was running the show. They told me Stürmer, but Azarin! How can something like that escape your intelligence, General? Well, who is Azarin? Among other things, Mr Haller, Colonel Azarin is the man who trains their spies. The best they've got. That's what makes the difference. - We know exactly what happened with... - Have you ever heard of plastic surgery? I've seen guys with their faces blown off, put back together so you didn't want to throw up every time you saw 'em. Maybe they couldn't smile, but they looked human, and that doesn't. Finch, you felt his arm. Tell the General how it felt. Sir, that's not an artificial limb. It's permanent, it's hard like metal all the way up to the shoulder. The whole damn thing is hard like metal. It doesn't look like him. It doesn't feel like him. It bears no resemblance to Lucas Martino. What do you suggest? Bring in my experts. Cybernetics, prosthetics, limb surgery, servo-dynamics, even metal fatigue. Azarin may have put him together, now we've got to take him apart. If he wasn't Martino, he wouldn't ever have mentioned Azarin. No. Azarin would expect us to know he was involved. It's our fault that we didn't. Will I be able to talk to him? Will he be able to answer me? In time, yes. His chest, his face, skull, are all crushed. I have to start again, give him something new. In the end, he will be able to speak. How long? - Three or four months. - No, that's too long, Doctor. Colonel Azarin, look closely at what's lying there. Three or four months is too long, Doctor. I need him sooner than that. Is his brain damaged? It's a miracle, but physically, no. The shock may have done some damage. He must lose most of his sensory organs. They are his brain's contact with the outside world. As soon as he can speak, hear, understand, I want him. So long as he's strong enough to answer my questions. That's what came over. We don't know what it is. It's meant to be Lucas Martino, but it could be anything. What happened to him? A car crash when he was in Brunswick for a conference. That's the border. I guess he wanted to see it. A lot of people, tourists, visitors, often do. He was with a colleague, Dr Newman, and one of our security men. They had a German driver. When we got there, we found what was left of the others. That's the wreckage. If our metal man is Martino, I can guess you can say he was lucky. If they hadn't gotten there as fast as they had, he certainly would have died. Finch? We made contact with them as soon as it happened. They told us that Martino was still alive. They gave us a complete detailed account of his injuries. However, they said that nobody could visit him, that we'd just have to take their word for what was going on. Now that is six months ago. Then, about a week ago, they made contact with us and said he's okay, we can have him back again. And then they gave us... that. Could I see a medical report? I think you have it there. It's page five in your brief. There is a point at which it's futile to try to repair the damage. It's easier to start again building up something quite new. There are a number of possibilities. One, that's not Martino, but a ringer. Two, he's capable of sending back information on anything he sees, if we let him back to work on the Neptune Project. And three, it is Martino, but he's been completely brainwashed. Any of these, he's dangerous. It is also possible that... that is Martino. If I was Azarin, and I had Dr Lucas Martino in my hands, I wouldn't let him back, not in a million years. The Americans want him back soon. They are very pleased that we saved his life, but now they are most anxious to relieve us of the burden. The only justification for keeping him is that we have to, to save his life. We must give him back at the end. If he dies, it will be most embarrassing. We are not to cause his death. I need him alive. I need to question him. They must be warned that, when he's returned, they will not recognise him. So long as the man we send back is alive, what he looks like doesn't matter. What is the longest I have? Well, I can hold them off for six months. Perhaps seven. In six months, you can see a real man again. You have two months, Doctor. Two months? In two months, he will function, but that's about all. Two months, Doctor. The head and body are made of a light metal alloy. It is rigid where the cranium used to be, so as to protect the brain. Other parts move with the elasticity of ordinary skin. The original right arm is integrated with the torso. It retains full power through electronic links to the central nervous system. Its strength is the same as the artificial left arm. Respiration and blood circulation are by a central pump situated in the lung cavity, replacing the heart. This pump is powered with a nuclear pacemaker, centrally located. Its beat is constant, doesn't vary under any circumstances. My name is Lucas Martino. I'm the supervisor of the Neptune Project in Florida. My name is Lucas Martino, I'm the supervisor of the Neptune Project in Florida. The larynx is human, but, due to grafting, doesn't appear to be entirely Martino's. As a result, his voice doesn't correspond to Martino's, although its pattern is similar. The taste buds have been grouped above the larynx and enable him to enjoy food and drink normally. The ears have been replaced with grilles in the traditional position. These give nearly perfect hearing over considerable distances. They're a little limited in identifying the direction of the sound sources. The eyes appear to be Martino's. It's impossible to be certain, because no retinal readings were taken before the accident. They have 20/20 vision. God knows what it was like when he opened them for the first time. Can you hear me, Doctor? I want you to concentrate. You've been in an accident, you have been quite badly hurt, but you're better now. I want you to try to open your eyes. Will you do that for me, please? Just open your eyes. Can you see me, Doctor? Don't try to speak. Just nod. Now, your right arm. Can you feel your fingers? Try moving them. There is no getting at someone in that condition. Well, then, er... is he human? Oh, yes. And some of him certainly used to be Lucas Martino. Who are you? I'm Lucas Martino. You don't look like Lucas Martino. I don't always feel like him. Who do you feel like? I mean, I, er... I don't feel like the same man as I did before the accident. There's considerable doubt that you are that man. Well, if I'm not, who do you think I am? Who? I presume you know that I was involved in an automobile crash. Don't presume a thing. Dr Martino was probably in a car crash. I think he died in it. Well, there must be things that only I could tell you, ways of finding out. We'll go through all that, don't worry. First, there's a simple question I'd like you to answer, if you are Dr Martino. Why did they let you come back? Well, I presume there was considerable diplomatic pressure exerted for my release. As far as we were concerned, you'd been kidnapped. I'm sure they tried to make you tell them about Neptune, about your work. Well, of course. Colonel Azarin interrogated me about nothing else. And you didn't tell them anything? There's one advantage of being the way I am, the only one so far, Mr Rogers, is that nobody can tell what I'm thinking or feeling. You'll find that out for yourself in the course of time, if you haven't already. But you told them nothing. About Neptune, nothing. Then they'd never have let Dr Martino come back. You seem to be going around in circles, Mr Rogers. There must be a better way. I just want to get back to Neptune. You have the advantage. You know what's behind the façade. You come up with a better way. You won't recognise his face, Dr Besser. He hasn't got one. What? Don't worry, he's not a monster. It's more like a... piece of sculpture. What am I meant to do? Don't talk to him about Neptune. Just tell me if you know him. Hello, Jacob. It's good to see you. Luke? It's all right. I'm the same Luke Martino underneath. It's... it's good to have you back with us. Er... when I, er... heard about the accident, I was afraid... Jake, how's the project? When I left, Hart's air traffic experiment was reaching a critical stage. Did he make out? I'm sorry, Dr Besser, I can't allow you to answer any questions about Neptune. Well, let me talk to Dr Besser alone. I'll tell him about Neptune. He doesn't have to talk, just listen. No discussions about Neptune. Jake, we worked for years together, you know me better than anyone else in the whole world. I don't know. The voice is different. What about the eyes? They look like Martino's... It isn't easy just looking at him like this. He obviously knows something about Neptune. He would, whoever he was. Can't you do better than that? How can I? What is there to recognise? If I can't talk about our work... Not until we're sure who he is. I am Lucas Martino. O... I am Lucas Martino. Lucas Martino. I am Lucas Martino. I am Lu... Don't stop for me, Doctor. You're doing very well. Am I? Your doctors are very pleased with you. We all are. How do you feel? As I look. Dr Kothu is a great man. He's a genius. Like you in your field. You were nearly dead when we dragged you from the wreck. Now you're alive, you can act, feel, eat and drink, and you feel no pain. You think not? Well, no... no physical pain. You'll get used to it quite soon. I hope not. We're naturally very curious about you. Saving the life of a great genius, we want to know more about you, about your family life, and the people you work with. Neptune? Oh, Neptune too, yes. No. Very well, other aspects of your work. No. Not in return for saving your life? You had to. - You couldn't question a dead man. - Oh, we'd have saved you. Whoever you were. All I ask is just a few details, not about your work, no, just yourself. Your family, where you were born, your school. Now, there's no reason for not telling me that, huh? This group covers Martino's childhood in the north, up until the time he first went to South Florida. Age about eighteen. These here are people who became close friends of his during his student days, and who therefore precede the classified area of his life, which starts when he was about 26 and first joined Neptune. This lot here are the scientists and technicians he works with on Neptune. Let's start with his parents. Right. Mother and Father. Both dead. Where did you get those pictures? You were an only child, your parents were Catholics... I want to know where you got those pictures. It doesn't matter. You were an only child. His mother had a bad time with the birth. She couldn't have any more after Lucas. Any sign in those days that he was a genius? No, not until he got to school. Anything particularly remarkable about his father? Italian, second generation. Simple farmer. Never allowed to do anything bright in his whole life. You know what we're looking for. Something our friend would not know about his childhood. Something that only Martino would know. - Unless somebody told him. - Right. Right. Well, I've picked out a few things here. Tell me if I'm onto something useful. First of all, he was always very busy. Looked after his father's tractor at the age of eleven. He was always building things, repairing things, taking them to bits and putting them back, to see how they worked. - Inventing things. - Anything specific? A water pump. The pump at the farm wasn't very efficient. Mother had a lot of trouble with it. Aged twelve, he built a new one. Very simple, very efficient. Never went wrong. I've seen it. Still there. Here's another incident from his schooldays. He's sixty-something now, his teacher. Says he still remembers Martino. He'd been teasing the boys about being so serious all the time. Kid suddenly came out with this huge great speech. He wrote it down afterwards. "The universe is a perfect structure, "constructed of perfectly fitted parts." If you rearrange the position of one part, you affect all the others. If you add something in one place, you have to take it away from somewhere else. If we knew where everything fitted, we'd be able to do things more efficiently. That's what physics is: it is serious. We are investigating the structure of the universe, and trying to figure out a system to handle it with. His teacher always swore he was taking a kind of a monastic vow. Irrefutable, permanent, forever. A vow. To whom? Basically to myself. That became the old boy's favourite story. He knew that speech by heart. Every time I came home from college, I would pray he wouldn't say it again. But he always did. Why did you make that vow? I didn't. It wasn't a vow, really. I was just a boy who had figured out something for himself, and wanted to show off to the rest of the class. He wouldn't accept that. It had to be a vow. And then? Hmm? That's it. No "then". Then. What happened next? I went home, I guess. Did you? I said, "I guess." I can't remember, not every detail. Try a little harder. You went to his study. You talked. What did you talk about? Ah, I remember. He wanted me to go for a scholarship. You know, one of those big industrial scholarships, and... I said no. You had a water pump. Huh? Tell me about the water pump. Which water pump, Mr Rogers? There's only one water pump, Dr Martino. Tell me about it. You must mean the one I built. It's still there, I guess. My mother had a hell of a time drawing water from the old pump. It needed hand-cranking. Never really worked. So, I built a new one. How old were you? Eleven. Good. We're doing very well, Lucas. You see, you had no need to be worried, had you? I'm only telling you what you already know. I don't know much about your Uncle Lucas. Is that when people started calling you Luke? Yes. In Miami? You know it, why bother asking? I'm interested. This is where your uncle's drugstore was, huh? Restaurant. There, you see. I do not know it all. Do I? Who else works there? There was my Uncle Lucas... Hey, Luke! Uncle Lucas! - How are you? - Good. Good. Hey, I want you to meet the prettiest girl on the waterfront. - This is Barbara. - Hello, Barbara. Hi, Luke. The noisy one over there, that's Tonino. - Hi, how are you? - Fine, thanks. Luke'll be working with us. Working his way through college. How much did he pay you, your uncle? A dollar an hour. I used to do five or six hours a night. Tips on top of that. We split them three ways, even on my day off. Fifty, sixty dollars a week. That's not very much. I got my meals free, and he gave me my room. What was he paying Tonino? I don't know. That's not true. Why are you lying to me? I'm not lying. I don't know. You do know. Eighty-five dollars, thirty cents. Look. That signature. Whose writing is it? Mine. Mmm. You were signing Tonino's pay cheques. Why? - When my Uncle Lucas was away, I would... - No. Why do you lie to me? I'm not lying. It was a long time ago. I don't get the point. The point is, Dr Martino, you want to get back to work. If you don't tell me the truth, I can't let you go back. That is the point. You do want to go back, don't you? Yes. - You got a dollar an hour. Tonino? - Dollar fifty. - How do you know? - I signed the cheque. Right. Why did they call you Luke? I told you before, to avoid confusion. He was Lucas, I was Luke. For Christ's sake! Will you sit down and answer my questions? Name... My name is Lucas Martino. I have nothing to say. My name is Lucas Martino. I was born... I'm so tired. You've got to let me rest. I'm so tired. You've got to let me rest. We fitted up an overhead pick-up in the ceiling of his cell. We're using infra-red lighting. We believe he can't see it. Every indication is that he's asleep, but we have no way of knowing for certain. My name is Lucas Martino. I was born... If that's real, it's classic interrogation. Keep him awake, keep asking him questions until he tells you everything. I'm so tired... Azarin had to try it. We have. Question and answer games are proving nothing. - Can't we use physical tests? - You know...! You know we've tried everything that's been invented so far. Do you think he's faking? ...is Lucas Martino. My name is Lucas Martino. My name is Lucas... Is it possible to brainwash him, make him one of ours? Colonel, to condition a man, you need to exert pressure. For that, you need more surface. More skin. You must be able to measure his pulse, his respiration, so you know when he's frightened, when he's tired, when he's... when he's telling the truth. So, we've created our own problem, huh? Mm-hmm. I've had enough. I want to get out of here. - What's wrong? - You can't mean that. Sit down and answer the questions. Questions, questions! What about skin pores? Enzyme patterns. Voice prints. Physical tests for a body like yours just have not been invented yet. The ones we've tried hurt you, and prove nothing. You know that. My fingerprints. Oh, sure, I know whose arm that is. I'll let that arm go anywhere it likes. It's the rest of you. Then use my mind. Let me go back to work. There's no-one else in the world that can finish Neptune the way it should be done. - Let me prove it that way. - No way. All you can see is security. You don't seem to understand the other aspects of the situation. Now, the State Department wants to get on with it. You'd be happy to send that metal man back to work, just because I can't prove he's not Martino, is that it? The point, Mr Rogers, the point in getting him back was to work on Neptune. Now, it wouldn't matter so much if he wasn't such a valuable scientist, but you are blocking the whole operation. He might just as well still be with the Russians. He probably is. It's certainly taking longer than I ever expected, Sean. If they cracked him, got him to tell what they wanted to know... We have no reason to believe they did crack him. They cracked everybody they ever wanted to. Why not him? The only person who could possibly have all that information, those memories, that knowledge of how to act, is Martino himself. Or someone taught to be Martino. Security isn't the only thing that matters. - If we haven't learned that yet... - Mr Haller, when we send an agent over the line to them, we don't just give him the right papers and let him get on with it. We give him the right coins, door keys, cigarettes, we give him photographs, printed on the right kind of paper, with the right kind of chemicals. We even put the right fluff and dust in his pockets, and that's not all. We give him memories of things that never happened to him. We train him to walk and talk their way. To write and read, drink and eat, spit, shit, smile, laugh, cry their tears, and it's all false, every single thing. But, if he's good, it becomes real, and he's no longer an agent. He's a baker, or a mechanic, or a train conductor. And no matter what they do to him, he remains a train conductor. He's as bewildered and scared as a train conductor would be, and, if necessary, he screams and bleeds and dies like a train conductor. He dies? And what if that man really is a train conductor, huh? What then? Doesn't your Colonel Azarin ever stop to wonder? If he starts acting as if that mattered, he won't be doing his job. He's finished. If I start to believe that our metal man is Martino, I'll be going soft on him, and I'll be finished, too. Aha. You're just not willing to admit you could be wrong, are you? Oh, no, no, I could be wrong. I know that. I have been, I've made mistakes. Every time I remember them, I break out in cold sweats. I wake up in the middle of the night wondering when the next time's going to be. Because one day, Mr Azarin might put a really good one over on me. It could be now. And if I make a wrong decision, my friend, all our kids could end up snorting vodka and eating borscht with chopsticks. He won't wake? - Not for some hours. - But he'll talk? About some things. Not the important ones, I think. - Neptune? - I think not. Only personal things that inhibit him when he's awake. - In detail? - Yes. Right, here's the dossier. Now, listen and study carefully. Lucas? Lucas! Lie still, Lucas, and listen to me. That's good. Now, Lucas, I want you to tell me about Edith. You and Edith. Were you in love with her? - Do you see it? - The colour? Its energy. For years, Edith, people have been talking about the sea's resources, its protein, how rich it is in food. But what they've missed is even more obvious: its power, its energy... Don't you ever stop thinking about work? We go someplace for a drink, and you talk about the way the molecules of gin combine with vermouth to make a dry martini. - I never did. - Yet. You will. But look, Edith. Look at the water. I see a pretty colour, I do not see a source of energy. What about tonight? Oh, I'm sorry, I'm meeting Frank Heywood. We've got some work to finish. Not again. Every evening for the last week, you two have been meeting because you've got some work to finish. We've only got a couple of months left before we deliver our thesis. Why can't you work during the day? Why does it always have to be the evening? That's the only time Frank's free now. Well, he should make himself free. You can't go on like this. You'll both be exhausted. It's only this month, until the Democratic Convention is over. Frank Heywood should make up his mind whether he wants to be a scientist or a politician. It's not fair to you. You mean, to you. Well, I hardly ever get to see you, Luke. You can't blame me if I get jealous. Don't. It won't make things any easier for us. Edith? I'll see you Monday, okay? Now will you tell me about the girl in your uncle's restaurant? About Barbara? Will you tell me about the other girl? About Barbara. Tell me about her. What happened, Luke? Did you have a fight? What do you mean? You and that girl Edith. She hasn't been in to eat recently. What do you know about Edith? Only what's obvious. You and her being in love is obvious, for instance. Well, we're not. Anyway, I'd hardly be with you now if we were, would I? Oh, Luke, I'm not vain, I don't mind being a substitute, if that's what you need. You're not a substitute for anyone, certainly not Edith. It's not like that. I don't mind what it's like. Now, if you're in trouble, I just hope you get it straightened out, that's all. Meantime... well, you don't have to pretend to be in love with me. Course, it's a damn shame, but... nothing's going to change that. So I'll just take what I can get. If you want to be with me, well, that's just fine. I'll know soon enough when you're bored. And, um... if everything works out with you and Edith, well, I think that's just great. Really. Right... Now, why don't you just relax, huh? Did you make it with her? Huh? Did you make it with her? That's none of your business. It is my business. I refuse to answer. Like it or not, Rogers, I still have rights. You have no rights anywhere. The United States Constitution was not made for metal men. It doesn't say any place that guys with metal heads and eyes that click every time they open have any rights. You prove you're who you say you are. You think you're protecting this girl from something? You're wrong, man, you're wrong. If you laid her, then two people know about it. You and her. Right? So you tell me, and if she checks out your story, we'll be one step nearer base. Barbara, we can't find. We're tracing her, but no luck so far. Only thing we do now is, she moves a lot. Edith, we have an address for her in Miami. Unmarried, works hard, straight. Uncle Lucas passed away twelve years back. Kid Tonino, killed in Vietnam. Okay, what about Starke and Heywood? You said to stay away from the Neptune people. Starke was his teacher. Check him. As for Heywood, you can check into their school days. Well, let's see. Okay, Heywood, Franklin. Born: November 16th, 1930. Father: Edward. Mother: Mary. Degrees: Bachelor of Science, University of Miami, 1950, Master of Science, University of Miami, 1951. Awards: Marshall Foundation Grant, 1952, Rothman Science Award, 1954. Organisation: Phi Beta Kappa, Sigma Chi. Joined Civil Service in 1956, research and development. Do you have any more details you would like to know? When did he first meet Martino? I'd say it was in 1948 under Professor Starke. They both graduated magnum cum laude, and stayed on as a research team together. In 1956, Martino started the work that led to Neptune, and was joined by Heywood. Heywood left the project this year, and went to Tokyo as a consultant. In fact, Heywood seems to be pretty much Martino's equal, scientifically speaking. When did they first meet? Under Professor Starke. Both graduated with honours, and stayed on, and worked as a research team together. 1956, Martino started the work that led to Neptune. Heywood joined him soon after. This year, Heywood left the project to go to Tokyo as a consultant. He almost seems to be Martino's equal, scientifically speaking. You think it... pow! Like that. You got it. I have to work it out, step by step. Oh, I get there, but I walk, you jump. Frank, you've got as good a brain as me. Ah, I just work harder. Look at this place. We're the first ones in here. It may be new to you, but I'm going to be here until it closes. You don't need to. It's easy for you. Maybe because I don't waste my time and energy on other things. - If you'd concentrate everything on science... - Mm-hmm. - You'd be able to... - I'd be just as inhuman as you. You don't care what happens to your work, do you? You'd let anybody use it, just as long as they gave you the money for the experiment to continue. The scientist's job is to find out the truth, and record it. No more. Leave the rest to the politicians. - The only people... - Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh. The only people who should control science, who should put it to use, are scientists. Not generals, not politicians. Us. Us, Frank? Or you? Heywood has nothing to do with Neptune. But he used to have, no? - He was taken off it months ago. - Why? I'm not going to tell you anything about Neptune. Hmm. Look at yourself, Doctor. - Look what you look like. - I know what I look like. We didn't have time to make it better, believe me. I had to ask you questions and we didn't have the time. But now, if you answer my questions, you can go back like a human being, I promise you. Your face'll be a little stiff, but you'll be able to smile and kiss and cry again. You bastard. You don't have to go back for two or three months. What you have to tell me would take only two weeks, and then Kothu could start to build you a better face, before it is too late. If he has to wait much longer, it will be too late. Azarin had him for over six months. I can't undo that knot in ten days. - You've tried everything? - Everything. What next? If you haven't managed anything in ten days, I don't see any reason why you ever should. There are still a few people left who really knew Martino. Confront them with our tin man, they may nail it for us. Where are they? Florida. Any place you like, except, of course, Neptune. You've made up your mind, then? I'm not Martino. I don't know yet. We've run out of time, that's all. Neptune can't wait. - They can't go ahead without me. - They're going ahead. That's crazy! Who's taken over. Who? That information's classified. Is it Besser? He thinks he can do it. He thinks he has a better idea than me. He's wrong. Is it him? I said it's classified. Could be Heywood. No, no, no, no, he's been out of touch for months. But he could catch up. Rogers, the one thing that kept me alive while they were doing this to me, was knowing that I'd have my work to come back to when I got home. Don't you understand? It's not my job. It's my life. We fly back tomorrow. What time will the plane be ready? We'll know as soon as he checks it out. Can I have a cigarette, Finchley? Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. What are you staring at? Why shouldn't I smoke? It's not my throat. Sorry, I didn't know I was staring. I look odd? I am odd, Finchley. Or hadn't you noticed? Ready if you are? So, now we know. Know what? That he's the real Martino. Well, this proves it. They think we're bringing him back, they're trying to get rid of him before we took him back to Neptune. That wasn't even real out there. You put a sub-machine gun in the hands of a professional, and he doesn't kill anyone? You're out of your minds. Well, even professionals make mistakes. Not Azarin. If he'd wanted to kill him, he would have. That was Azarin trying to make us believe we have the real Martino. They want him to go back to work on Neptune. He can go anywhere he likes, do anything he likes. You watch him. There's nothing physical for us to recognise, so know his mind, know how Martino would think. He'll know you're watching him, whoever he is, so a lot of his actions may well be meant to mislead us. We don't even know that he's not going to blow himself up, so I want to know if he starts taking himself to pieces. If someone stands on his feet and puts a dime in his mouth, I want to hear how much that person weighs. But one thing is certain, if he's a ringer, they'll have taught him to find his way round the city in the dark. He'll know every street, every house, any place he might have been to as a boy. Mr Rogers? Edith Hayes. What did he have to look up her address for? She hasn't moved for eight years. Because if he's really Martino, he wouldn't know that. Okay, keep on going. Let me know if you turn up any others. He's sitting outside her apartment. Why doesn't he go up? - Because he's scared. - Of what? Of Edith knowing he's not Martino? Or of Edith seeing him like that? I don't know. Either way, I don't think this is going to work. He's not going to go in. Sir, I've got another page for you. - Hewitt to Hiawatha. - Hiawatha... Er, Indian folk art, sir. Mail order. Franklin Heywood, 208 Magnolia. You know something, Finch, sometimes I think Colonel Azarin is pissing in his pants laughing at us. He's going in. Who've you got in the street? Spencer. You join him, just in case. - For what? - I don't know, but the next half hour is going to be pretty rough on both of them. Yes? Edith? I'm Edith Hayes, yes. What do you want? It's Luke, Edith. Lucas Martino. Luke? I've been in an accident, Edith. My face is odd. I don't want to frighten you. Let me see. Luke? Luke Martino? Yes. May I come in? Yes, of course. He's gone in. Is there something a man has that makes people recognise him, no matter what he looks like? People have been trying to answer that question for years. What do you think he's after, going in there? If she believes him, then maybe we'll believe him. Here we are. They're moving into the sitting room. We'll pick them up in a couple... there they go! Sit down. You have a very nice apartment, Edith. You... you fixed it up very comfortably. I spent a lot of time on it. Would you like a drink? Hmm? Can you have a drink? I drink, I eat, I smoke, yes, thank you. Do you mind... talking about it? I used to. Then I wished I were dead. What would you like? - I have Scotch... - Scotch would be fine. What made you change your mind about being dead? My work. That figures. I almost called you this afternoon, to ask about coming over, but I was afraid you'd refuse. You should have known you'd be welcome. When I was in the hospital, Edith, I spent a great deal of time thinking about us. We never really knew each other, did we? One of the reasons I stopped by today, because... I wanted to apologise for that. I never knew how to treat you. I think I always thought of you as some kind of a problem to be solved, not as a person. Why else? Huh? You said that was one of the reasons you wanted to visit. Well, I... I knew that you wouldn't make me feel uncomfortable, ask questions, stare at me. I... Just as before, Edith, I'm being very selfish. The FBI is not sure whether I can be trusted. They'll be investigating you. Why should they be interested in me? Because they're as anxious as I am to prove that I'm... Lucas Martino. They're giving me a chance to establish my identity for them. You see, Edith, if we can find just one thing, just one thing that only you and I could possibly know... Doesn't matter what it is, just that it checks out. That might convince them. I could tell them how we met in the park. I told them that already. Er... we... took a boat trip across the bay. Do you remember? Yes... That was in the spring of '56, wasn't it? It was summer. I remember I wore a woollen sweater, and I got much too hot, and you let one sleeve fall into the water. That's the kind of thing. And I had to pay because you dropped your money getting into the boat. So we... we didn't come back by boat, we came back over the causeway? Excuse me one second. I have something in the oven. He's still in the sitting room. She seems to have gone to the kitchen. That sound like a Russian agent to you? They sound like a couple of high school kids. She thinks it's him. Rogers'll tell you that's a trained agent. You take a few pieces of information, you talk some generalities, fool somebody. Well, he can't guess it all. Okay, now there are two ways to get over there, aren't there? You can go over on a boat, you can go over on the causeway. Now if you go over on the boat, the chances are 50/50 you come back on the causeway. So she might not know it, but he could be pumping her dry. Will you stay to eat? Oh, no, thanks, Edith, I... I really do have to get back to my hotel. You know... I was in love with Lucas Martino. I have no reason not to welcome seeing him again. I'm lonely, too. I'll call you. You did very well, Miss Hayes. I'm sure you can be of help. I'm sorry if it was a bit of an ordeal for you. I think it's best if we leave our equipment installed for the time being. You understand? He's liable to come back. He won't come back He looks... lost. I'd better go see if he's all right. Dr Martino, you okay? Dr Finchley... Look, er... if you want to go to your hotel, I'll take you. No thanks, I'm not going back to my hotel. But, you just said... Said what? You've been listening, haven't you? You've got her apartment bugged. Look, tell Rogers I've got a problem with Martino and have to follow him. Dr Martino! Dr Martino! I'm sorry about Finchley. Is there anybody else you can think of who might help? What about Barbara? We finally found her. She wouldn't recognise her own father. She's completely out of her head. What condition is the farm in? I'm sorry? I said, what condition is the farm in? My parents' farm. I haven't been there since my mother died. Is there something there you think might help us? Not us. Me. I don't think I understand you. I've had enough, Mr Rogers. I have to go somewhere where I can be on my own. The farm's pretty run down. We could arrange for you to take a trip up to the Canadian Lakes, if you like. The Bureau's got a couple of hundred acres there. There's some cabins... I guess I still own the farm. I might as well go there and get used to living on my own again. I have some money saved. I'll need it to get the farm started. What's happened? Suddenly, you've changed your mind? Not suddenly. Partly Edith... Finchley... Mostly me. I can't take anymore. What about Neptune? I wouldn't be able to cope. You think panic has something to do with the heart racing, the nerves getting tense, the breath getting laboured? Mine doesn't. But I'm in a constant state of panic, Mr Rogers. My mind is poised for flight. I'm on the edge of screaming all the time, except that if I did, more people would stare at me, and that would make me scream more, until I wouldn't be able to stop. No. If you had let me go back to Neptune, straight back, I might have been able to cope. I'd have been with people I know, people who don't look at you... your face, what you look like. Just at you, your mind, your work, your ideas. You won't let me hide among them, so I'll hide on my farm instead. We're only just starting. I've got a checklist of people who knew you at college. - There's Professor Starke. - You'll have to get by without me. You'll know where to find me. You said the only thing that kept you alive, was the thought of getting back to work. We may clear you. You could be back at Neptune inside the month. We need Martino. It's as simple as that. I can't do it. Martino started this project, Mr Rogers. No-one else can finish it. - Can that metal man? - If he's Martino, then we need him. - If? That's a hell of an 'if'. - Yes, but if he's not Martino, he probably wouldn't understand anything going on around here anyway. If he were Frank Heywood? He could, yes. I don't think he could carry it forward, but he'd have been able to understand it. Why was he taken off it? You've seen security here. Let's say Heywood was, er... temperamentally unable to operate under the restrictions imposed by security. You mean, he resented it? Just he didn't feel happy. He was insecure. Could the metal man be Frank Heywood? He could, if he wasn't dead. If we can't break him, the Americans couldn't break him either, could they? No. Why should they want to? Neither him, nor somebody like him. Would you send in my visitor, please? I once asked you if you could make me another one like that? You can? Oh, yes. It's relatively easy now we have done it once. I can't send Martino back. They'd never forgive me if I sent him back. Come in! Ah, welcome, at last. At last. Dr Kothu, this is the gentleman I was just discussing. Frank Heywood, I'd like to present you to my colleague, Dr Kothu. It's a pleasure to meet you, Doctor. It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr Heywood. - I'm sure you'd like a drink, Frank. - Oh, yes. - I may call you Frank, may I? - Yes, of course. I hope you had a pleasant journey? As well as could be expected, thank you. Next time, I'd appreciate something less unnerving than parachuting into the Black Sea. But you arrived safely, that's the main thing. Mm-hmm. And I ruined a perfectly good suit in the process. - Prost! - Prost! Doesn't matter who you think he may or may not be, he has to go back. I can't condone a possible foreign agent working on a project as sensitive as this, sir. It's no longer your decision. If this man is not Martino, sir, you can be certain that Colonel Azarin's been planning this coup for a long time. Neptune must go forward. Public relations alone make that desirable. Public relations are hardly... I'm not used to having to explain State Department decisions. It's a dangerous decision, Mr Miller. We put him back to work. If he's not who he says he is, then it's quite probable he'll make a mess of things, and we'll quietly retire him on a hero's pension. We'll watch him... to be accurate, you will watch him, to be quite sure he doesn't blow everybody up. No harm will be done, and so far as the rest of the world will know, Neptune's on the road again. If Martino, it really will be on the road again, and for that, we are prepared to risk a very great deal indeed. Now, you go and bring him back. That... is Luke? Dr Kothu saved his life. He was dead for a while. You think the Americans would let him go back to work looking like that? Well, I don't see why not. They might be suspicious of him, who he is? Why should they be? Identity doesn't depend just on physical appearance. Quite so. It's rare to meet a man like you, Frank, prepared to give up so much for his beliefs. I don't think of it as giving anything up. We would like you to go to America again. Would you do that for us, Frank? That's impossible. They think I'm dead. Not as yourself. We would change your identity. To whom? We would like you to go to Neptune. I'd never be allowed to go near that. In any case, there are too many people there who know me too well. I'd never get away with it. No. No. Oh, no, I... I couldn't go back like that. You wouldn't have to stay like that. For you, it would only be temporary. Oh, no. I... I... I'd never get away with it. They'd find out. We will teach you everything about him. Here he's being asked every tiny little detail of his life. You will learn to be Martino. For a man of your intellect, Frank, it could be a fascinating challenge. How would you make me look like that? Don't be worried about that. He was a wreck. You are not damaged. For you, it's a simple procedure. The Americans will believe it's Martino because they want to believe it. And then you can go back to Neptune. The culmination of your life's work, Frank. I don't know. If they didn't believe me, if they didn't let me come back, I mean, what would I do? Don't worry. So what would I do, then? Until we could bring you back, you could go to Martino's farm. It would not be for long. - Hi, Mr Rogers. - Where is he? In the field. Morning, Willis. You can get lost for a while. Rogers! Social visit? Not entirely. I've come to ask you a few more questions. All right. I knew we could depend on you, Frank. If there's no other way. To find out about Neptune? No. I've come to ask you to go back to Neptune. - You made up your mind at last. - If you like. You wouldn't ask me if you weren't sure. Of course not. Well? Are you sure, or aren't you? I'm not. But everybody else is? More or less. Will you believe that I didn't like treating you the way I had to? I believe that, certainly. Does it matter? It does to me. I have the job of persuading you to forgive me, relent, and go back to work. Forever the professional. They just said, "it doesn't matter who or what he is, - "go down there, and bring him back." - That's right. Don't worry. You'll be all right, Frank. Whoever I am? That's right. Whoever you are. I'm smiling, Rogers. Perhaps you can't tell, but I'm smiling. Will you come back? Will you accept the fact that you've won? I'm a farmer now. And I'm accepted for what I really am. What you really are? A man with a metal face. Is that all? I have my memories, but they're wrong. They're memories of a previous life, when I was someone else. Doesn't matter who. I know. I have my dreams, but they're different now. I once hoped to change the whole world with my work. Now I change the earth, not the world. I like it here. It doesn't matter what I look like. I am, and my small world accepts me for what I am. You don't regard this as running away? No. I took on more than I could bear, by just staying alive. The more I hear now, the more certain I grow that I was wrong. Careful, Mr Rogers, that could be me being extra clever at the end. No, I don't bear any grudges. I'm here, not because of what you did, but because of what I did. The vanity of martyrdom. Mmm, partly. Also, the vanity of achievement. So this farm will be your only contribution to the development of the human race? Look at me, Rogers. Look at me really hard. What I used to be is buried deep underneath what you see now. In the end, you know, you're quite right to doubt my identity. I'm a metal man, staring out of a metal skull. Human eyes, peering at the world from a metal face. But inside, I've stopped screaming. If I can live I like this, then anyone can survive anything we care to do to them. You can walk, talk, move around like a normal human being. There's many that can't. I know. But when you look at me, you're not really sure I'm here. He's dead. Why? Martino didn't die. Why should Heywood? Technically, he died of shock. Post-operative shock. The difference is that Martino really wants to live. But Heywood... I'm not even sure he knew what had happened to him. But to live like that, you've got to want to live. What are you going to do with Martino now? What can I do? I'll have to send him back. I'll tell them "no". May I tell them who you are? Tell them I'm not Lucas Martino, any more. Goodbye, Rogers. Bye, Luke. SUBTITLES BY POWERHOUSE FILMS LTD
