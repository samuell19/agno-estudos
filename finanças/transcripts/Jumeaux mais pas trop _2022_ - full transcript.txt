Don't worry, Pascal, there's plenty of snow. Sylvie needed snow chains to go up. All the way from the Chamois roundabout. She skidded all over the place. The shame of it... The Sauternes is perfect, pal. It was hidden in the fridge behind the flu shots. I helped myself. - Doctor, 10 cm dilation! - Gotta go. No rest even at Christmas. C'mon, ma'am, let's push! C'mon, push hard, push hard. That's it! - Go on, miss! - C'mon, push! That's it, keep on pushing! That's good. Here he comes! It's a bouncing baby boy! Hi, sonny. - The cord, doctor. - I know, I'm not stupid! There, that's it. Well done, ma'am. That's good, miss. We've done good work here. Right, I'm off to La Clusaz. - Keep pushing. - What for? The second one. You're right! Let's go! Come on then, push hard. This one's gonna be easier! What a pretty... - Boy! - Yes, a boy. - Here. - The scissors. Of course. One quick snip. There we go! Well done, miss. The magic of Christmas. TWO OF A KIND 33 years later - How much? - Nothing, Jocelyne. - Nothing? - The guarantee. What guarantee? I bought it in '74! It's a 50-year guarantee. A US-style 50-year one. - I hope you make a living... - Don't worry. There, it's good for another 50 years. Have a good day, Jocelyne. How's it going, guys? All good? How's things, bros? - Thanks for Dad's dishwasher. - He can pay me for the microwave now. How's it going? - I'm good. - Cool. It's non-stop. Antho, d'you do wheelies too? No, seriously. You don't need a lock. It's Dad's and sacred. It should be in a flea market. Flea market it. I'll flea market you! Look at that clown... Hard work... Stop eating! That guy wears me out. I love nature and I love my region passionately. Drop "passionately". Ok, so what do I put? I love my region a lot? Useless. Say, "I love my nature and my region." Overdoing it sounds fake. So, I love nature and I love my region. As said brilliantly by... - Why "brilliantly"? - I don't know. Ok, you win. No more adverbs. Any word over three syllables, you lose the locals. So here goes. As said by Guez de Balzac, an Angoulême native like me, "As life is so short, our passions should not be immortal." Can we be less clear? - No. - Ok. Let's go. The press conference is in 10. It is. With the champs... - Shit... - Yeah... Shipped in from Paris and thinks he'll get elected. We don't need a jerk like him here. I think I've found the problem. Listen, I have to go. There's a sort of... - You need a new solenoid. - A solenoid? A solenoid is a small electric valve that keeps liquids flowing. The diaphragm enters the compression chamber, making it totally compressed. I think it needs descaling. - Hard water? - No. It's not under guarantee anyhow. - Not under guarantee? - No. We can do a deal. I'll fix it with what I have and you get a nice clean shirt. - Are you kidding? - No, I'm just trying to help. - It's a win-win situation. - Well, no. It's not win-win. - It's under guarantee. - Under guarantee? Optimum guarantee! Can you read? Yes, I can read. The 299 euros are for what? - The guarantee. - The guarantee. Ok. And 269 is the price of... - The machine. - The machine? Yes, the price of the machine. What a sucker... Here you go, Mr. Optimum. Because you, the local press, exalt journalism. Journalism close to people, grassroots journalism, journalism often mocked by the Paris elite for some reason or other. Personally, I think they're jealous because your sales are stable. Keep it simple! We'll talk again soon. Thank you for coming. Hold on! Sorry. Mr. Deltor! Leading light of the local press. True, but it's not about that. The thing is, you've built up your campaign on your regional roots. That sounds good. But for a man who has spent his life between Oxford, Princeton and parliament, it looks like parachuting. - Berkeley, not Princeton. - Ok. - Berkeley is better. - Ok. But you won't answer? Mr. Deltor, sorry, but I'm a child of Angoulême. I left to enrich myself intellectually to return and serve the region. Like your dad? 30 years of hassle over Dad's book! A white in Africa has to be a colonialist! So damn simplistic. Ignore their attacks. Just stay calm. - I am calm. - Where to? - Up your ass. - HQ, Mathieu, HQ. Of course. - I swear, you're incredible. - The verdict? You have to "behave". Ridiculous! Using my junk these days is like playing pool with a wet rope. - Dad... - You'll see. - Yeah. - And the fees? - I'll work it out. - You don't have to, Antho. You don't owe me. "Love isn't owed, it's a gift." You said so. The Bel-Air centre takes flight I'll reopen the community centre. Forget it, the funding's dried up. Those were other times. I could stay with you if you're broke. My place is tiny! They look after you here. Who looks after you? Still no gal? They come and go. - But they don't stay. - No. Forget grandkids. - How's work? - Don't worry about it. Thanks, son, for saying you'll relaunch the association. You won't be able to, but it's kind to say so. Only natural, Dad. Shit... My mum gave me the watch. That's a pity. - Meaning? - Meaning I don't give a shit. But my mum gave it to me. I really need to get it back... Yes, buddy? Of course I'm coming. With her sister? The chubby one? Holy cow! - My watch... - A cup and championship double. Unbelievable. Idiot! See you. Fredo, what a jerk! So, where were we? Yes, your watch. I threw your watch out. - You didn't? - I did. Renew your subscription to Mickey Mouse magazine. They'll send another. I also took the liberty of telling your boss about your scams. And, believe me, your boss really wasn't pleased! - You're a scumbag. - Think so? That's funny. My wife often says, "Honey, you're a scumbag!" It's fun chatting to you, but I have a party in town tonight. I have to get ready. Have a good evening, Mickey pal! This setting tells me a story. Here we go, Noddy in the vineyards. I see words and poems. Grégoire Beaulieu displays an unexpectedly rural side today. Look, this one's beautiful. Nearly ripe. He's actually eating a grape! What an asshole. Shit. I can't do that. What a bastard. Shit... I sincerely love my region. As Guez de Balzac wrote so splendidly... You've read Guez de Balzac? Shit... I'm not afraid to say Charente recharges and comforts me. What do we have today? Some amazing courgettes... What the hell? This guy's sick. Mr. Morand? Mr. Morand? You're not dead. I don't want to! Ok, here goes. No, I can't. I just can't! Gently! Gently! That's it, gently. Breathe. - Mummy! - Not Mummy, no. - Mummy's beautiful. - No, the machine guy. The guarantee. - I made a mess. - That's ok. - It's ok! - Cuddle! No, no cuddles! Calm down. Sit. There, that's good. That's good. Gently. Mummy's coming, ok. Mummy? For the interview, we might pick an angle from which the decor is less... elaborate. You don't like the hangings? I do, but we're trying to dispel lingering prejudices. Lingering? Ok, I get it... Deltor. Yes. He has a hang-up about your excellent book. That man's a total idiot. - I can talk for hours about Africa. - Maybe not. Forget Deltor. Let's not show items that call to mind... A little... That are... They're everywhere. We just love Africa. We knew Grégoire would work for the good of others. He loves getting involved. He has politics in his blood. Like his dad. I was mayor of Angoulême. Before your time. Of course. Let's talk about Grégoire's birth. At Christmas, right? Yes. - A wonderful moment. - What is Christmas after all? A sacred moment in French life. Even more so for us as we celebrate Christ's birth and our son Grégoire's. Two Messiahs in one! Very funny. How about a drink? Tea, coffee, Coke, G&T... G&T... What am I saying? Not at 11 AM! Sorry, I have to take this. Can we cut? Of course. Cut. What'll you have? Coffee? Tea? Coke? Schweppes? - What? - The lady's not thirsty. - What? - Who is it? - Is it a joke? - Afraid not. We found Mr. Morand dressed as an old hooker. He got done good. You know I'm campaigning right now. I'm too busy for this. Indeed. But why is your DNA on file? The stalker in parliament two years ago. As a white attaché under 40, my DNA was taken, like everyone's. Hold on, what does "common genetic markers" mean? Mr. Morand's attacker shares your DNA, Mr Beaulieu. Like a sort of twin. Or it was you. Listen, this is totally absurd. - Who is he? - The other guy? - Yes, we're talking twins alright. - Don't be hasty. DNA is never wrong. Not once in 19 months on the job. You have your suspect anyhow. How do you do! I'm Fraises. Like strawberries. I'm your pro bono. Your lawyer. Sorry I'm late, Dimitri, I train the badminton juniors. So bad they'll end up lawyers. - Ok, but I'm Anthony like it says. - Let's not complicate things. Your hearing is at... Shit, it's now! Let's go. Come on, move! Excuse me! Come on, Dimitri! - Doing ok, Abdel? - Fine. Your family? Anything metal. Keys, phone, wallet. My phone. Of course, the Teflon kneecap. From 2014. I missed the shuttlecock and dislocated my knee. It was hell. I nearly played pro. I ended up alone at home... Help me out. I put on 20 kilos, my wife left... We made it. Have a good day. Ok, let's sum it up. You broke in with a crowbar. Who does that now? - I found it. - To get a Mickey Mouse watch? My mum gave it to me. I'm fond of it. So you revived the owner whom you found unconscious and, after saving his life, he took you for his mother, pounced on you.. - Asking for a cuddle. - A cuddle? Hold on... You save his life and he pounces on you? Liar. I know it sounds weird, but I never touched him. Right. What's the bandage? I cut myself on the razor in the bathtub. You were mending the washing machine. - No. - Yes. - No. - Why? It was in the kitchen. Good point. - We'll plead guilty. - What? Judges love a spontaneous confession. - I'm not going to jail. - Dimitri, trust me. It's Anthony... Put forward the notion of family in a much broader sense without being too reactionary. Keep away from "roots". I'm not interested. "True twins are often considered carbon copies. "However, in very rare cases, they may not be the same colour. "There's a one-in-a-million chance of that happening." Before we begin, Your Honour, I'd like to ask you a question. When you look at this young man, what do you see? I'll answer for you. I see a child, a child of 33 with a little beard. A kid. A little cherub. Who never knew his parents. A child who, heeding only his courage, used a crowbar to break open Mr. Morand's kitchen door! A crowbar, Your Honour, imagine that! A crowbar. Such violence! When the only crows he knew were in Dumbo ! Dumbo who, remember, was also parted from his mother in the movie. Even if he was reunited with her at the end. I think. Yes. Yes, Your Honour, Dimitri is guilty. Who's Dimitri? But for this attempted murder, albeit accidental, given the profile of the accused, I call on you, Your Honour, as a mother. I have no children. I call on you as an aunt, an auntie. A cake-baking Auntie, a comfort-giving Auntie. Vacation Auntie. I call on you as an aunt to deliver a fair sentence, but also an exemplary one. And lenient too. Because, Your Honour, haven't young people suffered enough already? That's all. Thank you for listening. Have you finished? We've suffered enough too. Alright, I'll sum up the facts. - Nothing was stolen. - Nothing. As for the attack, the paramedics report a vascular issue, followed by a bout of dementia. Moreover, the DNA recovered has led to the identification of two people with virtually the same genetic markers. Just a second... Exactly. Why are we here? This hearing is adjourned, while awaiting further information. In particular, the victim's testimony and a clarification of the DNA. Next case. My first ever acquittal. Adjournment. What's that about DNA? It's fantastic! A client goes free for once. What was that about DNA? They can't say if the DNA they found is yours or your twin brother's, to put it simply. I'm off. - Acquitted. - What's he saying? Excuse me, Mr. Fraises! Hurry, I have to get to badminton. What is it? I have no brother. - You do. - I don't. - You do. - No. - You must have. - No. - Dimitri... - I'd know about a twin. The police summoned you both. You see! Ask your mum. Something's fishy. Just walk off. Fine by me. Excuse me... Yes? Anthony. - Ibamy. - This is weird. Who are you? Right, you don't know. Hold on tight, it's pretty incredible. - Did you know? - Did I know what? You and I are brothers. - Brothers? - Brothers. - Foster homes too? - Sorry, I have two brothers already. And you're not one of them. I come from Brest. You're not just bragging? Who brags about Brest? Right. Ok, sorry. Forget about it. I don't know what you did but good luck. The judge is cool. Yeah, she's cool. I know her. Goodbye. An up-and-coming politician returns to Charente Grégoire Beaulieu December 24, 1988 That's crazy. - It's the same. - That's right, look, here's a photo. No. twins black and white possible? What a nightmare! Holy shit! - Yes? - This is Central Genetic Analysis. Oh, yes, thank you for calling back so quickly. I can only confirm what I told Inspector Solansse. The sample taken relates to two individuals and so to twins, without a doubt. - Ms. Vignon? - Yes. Twins... You mean... With the same mother? Do twins have different mothers? No, it's just that they're not the same colour... It's rare, but it happens. One parent may carry an ethnically different gene, even distantly, and only one twin develops that gene. Even rarer, hyper-ovulation. Two separate eggs, intercourse with partners of different origins... Ok, I understand. Thank you. Goodbye. You're welcome. Two extra points in the latest poll. - That's great! - Not bad, huh? I like this dynamic. You were right, Noémie. Family is old hat, but everyone relates to it. Unless we screw up, this looks good. Really good. - Heard from Solansse? - Who's Solansse? - The cop. The DNA. - Ah, the DNA. Yes. Well, no... Yes... No. The DNA was a mistake. The whole thing has blown over. The DNA... I'd totally forgotten about it. It completely slipped my mind. - Ok, Noémie? - Yes, in great shape. Why? Let's go, guys! - What do you want? - To see Grégoire Beaulieu. What for? I like his programme. I feel close to him, if you see what I mean. Alright... You know. This family secret can't leak. We've worked hard on this campaign. Please don't get offended, it's nothing personal. Hold on a second. Time out. Beaulieu really is my brother? - What? You didn't know? - This is wild! Yes, but I wasn't totally sure. I knew it wasn't the lawyer or the cop. The only one left was... He's my brother? "Charente Heart"? I realize this must come as a big shock. You're probably even shaken, but you realize Grégoire can't learn about this now. Yes, of course, the poor guy. Discovering a black twin brother is kinda awkward. - He hit the jackpot. - I presume you don't mind waiting a bit. What about the two bastards who abandoned me? The two... Grégoire's parents, you mean? - Yes, our parents. - We're not in their shoes. - Right. - It may be simple. - I'm sure. - A special situation... Obviously! - Maybe they did it for your own good. - I'm sure they did. Between Grégoire and Anthony, Anthony and Grégoire, the choice can't have been easy. I'm really sorry. I think Grégoire will be shocked to find out. You bet. - He'll want to clear this up. - Right. Can it just wait until the campaign's over, please? You're not serious? She is serious. We could work something out. - A back-up driver? - Exactly. At the police station, I thought the press is bound to focus on it... - It's that DNA thing. - No, that's rubbish. But it's best to kill it in the bud. Here's the official version. You saw the police to help former delinquents. I'm into that now? - Yes. - Ok. - That guy... - Anthony. Does Anthony know about the DNA? No. Good. Deltor would write about it just to piss me off. That said... I understand him. Imagine if it was true. Your guy there, my brother... That'd be a real scoop. "Did Beaulieu's parents abandon his black twin?" I don't think our voters would like it. Are you ok? Sorry, yes, it's just stress. It's the campaign. - Noémie. Be strong. Take a breath. - Yes. - It's politics, not the Care Bears. - Yeah. Thank you. - I'll introduce you? - Alright. Anthony! Delighted! Welcome on board. - So, you committed a few petty crimes... - I'm innocent. Innocent petty crimes like everyone. - I'm honoured to reach out to you. - That's a bit much. - We were saying with... - Noémie. The youth centre in the Bel-Air project... Your pals axed the budget, but if you're elected, you could reinstate it. - Reinstate it? - The budget. For the youth centre. They're totally "Charente Heart", "Unite our efforts". Fighters. Yes, Bel-Air. It's a really good idea. Hold on, I'll stop you there. Bel-Air and all that stuff... It's outside our remit. The region handles it. Morand. Morand... - Gérald Morand? - Why? Do you know him? Oh, yes, of course you know him. That's funny. It isn't. Ouch. It's going to be tough asking him for a few favours. At 8, Grégoire would come to Caritas with us. - He loved being useful. - Don't embarrass me. It's true. The hypocrites. They never miss mass, but they're backstabbers... Let's talk about Grégoire's birth. At Christmas, right? Yes. A wonderful moment. Screw you and your wonderful moments. A sacred moment in French life. Even more so for us... You're not eating? I'm not hungry. Two Messiahs in one! Yes? Can I help you? We've had reports of fibre broadband problems. Really? I didn't even know we had it. You have it or you don't. Yes... Well, come in. Mind the step. Shall I show you? How do taps and pipes help with the fibre network? It's broadband, ma'am, so that means taps and pipes. Of course. - Your son? - Yes. Do you recognize him? You must be proud. Our Grégoire is... - No other children? - No. An only son. Why? You can love other kids less... I imagine so... You can be ashamed and hide them. Or even abandon them sometimes. Lovely! It's tough abandoning a child. You must regret it. Yes, probably. Are you done? Yes, I'm done. Totally done. - What's wrong? - What the hell do you care? I'll flatten you. I'm gonna flatten you. What? He thinks we'll get a flat. He senses danger like a meerkat. Bullshit... You, the brother I never had If only you had lived The things we'd have done together Black is black I want my baby back You say nothing? - Do something. - I'll tell him you can't work like this. - Go on. - Ok. Where are you, Dad? Anthony! Anthony! - Yeah? - Can we turn it off? You don't like to sing? I do, but I have an interview to prepare. Fine, but I need to sing to relax. If I don't, I talk too much. A bit of music is nice too... You're defending him? I kind of like him. He's nicer than the other one. - Shall I drive? - No. I'm starving! A snack bar. Want to stop? No, not at all. Just keep driving, Anthony, ok? Ok, but if I don't eat, I talk too much. Service area - A nightmare... - It's not bad. Delicious even. - Not eating your fries? - Be my guest. Yes, it's him. Grégoire Beaulieu! - They're wondering. It's him. - No, it isn't. They're happy. - He loves it. - No, I don't - Hello. - We thought it was you. - Yes, it's me. - We didn't expect to see you here. - Why not? I like simple things. - Simple, but not cheap. A meal and fuel, on our limited pension... That's what I said. If you cut pensions, how will they manage? - Who asked you? - He was saying pensions are too high. - I didn't. - You said they have enough. I didn't say anything, ok? How do they get by? Not everyone has an Audi... - Ignore him. - Excuse me... - Can we do a photo? - Sure! - No... - Come on, just a quick one. Edge in a bit. There you go! It's a good one. Great! - Who's this? - They're cute. - Fetch the car. - No! Wait. Sir, stand here, please. Who are you? You're too slow. Speed up. I'm at the limit. We can't do just anything. We're not just anyone. Here we go... Sir, ma'am, hello. Please stop the engine. Certainly. Hello, how are things? Not too much pressure these days? - The papers. - Of course. The thing is, we're on our way to a TV show. A debate on a news channel. We're a bit late. Did my driver commit an offence? He ran a light. No... I don't believe it. I keep telling him about that. We respect the law, Anthony! - Bastard... - Will you forgive him? - My licence is clean. - Your licence, sir. My licence? - Driving licence. - I passed. Near Angoulême. The roundabout was a bit tricky. I nearly ran a light but didn't. And my parking was perfect. May I see your driving licence? See it... for real? - No... - See it with your eyes? - Get out. - Yes. No... - You never asked for his licence? - Why? He's a driver. That's logical for you, not for him. They're not like us. They're outside the law. Those people don't think like us. - Those people? - Cut it out. Never mind. Forget it. We'll find him another job. No way, he's finished. I don't want to see him again! Let's split. I'm pissed off. Is he dumb or what? Shit, yes... Sorry. I'm a bit confused. Anthony! Your... December 24th... What? Never seen a black guy with ID before? I can explain. So, the DNA... Yeah. Actually, I was waiting until after the campaign because... I thought... - Fuck. - Weird, huh? It came as a shock to me too. We're brothers. - It's not true? - DNA isn't a politician. It doesn't lie. Shut the hell up! I have enough to stomach. To stomach? Fine The thing to stomach is splitting. - Wait. We're mixing everything up. - No, we aren't! No mixing since birth! "One black, one white. Which do we keep? Let's toss. "Heads, the white, tails, not the black." Bravo, Grégoire. What did that idiot do? Finished, honey? It's about to start. Are you ok? Why let a stranger in for a fibre network we don't have? I thought not. Sorry, but we're sick of these concepts. Equal opportunities, help, trickle down... The same stuff for 40 years. But on a practical level, nothing. Grégoire Beaulieus are ten a penny in Paris. - You're all clones. - Better a clone than a clown. - We'll see about that. - You're making a spectacle of yourself. Your programme's the spectacle. It's eyewash. Please! Please! You won't be holidaying together. - No. - I'd rather die. So, Grégoire Beaulieu, you have focused on family ideals recently. On family ideals. Mr. Beaulieu, family? - I can talk about it. - Yes... Family... Of course, but it depends on what family we mean. Is it the family of pretence, secrecy and taboos, or the family of truth and brotherhood. What is this? When I talk about brotherhood, I mean liberty, equality, fraternity... Sisterhood too. Doesn't he seem weird? That idiot wrecked the TV. I can't judge on this thing. He's weird on the phone too. You rave about your region and home: Angoulême. That's good. Some say it's to mask your Parisian side. - What do you say? - Angoulême... Yes, indeed, Angoulême... People say... They say I don't... But what is Angoulême? - Angoulême is a city. - Thanks. But it's a city twinned with more than nine other cities on several continents. Because twinning is good, it's healthy. He's freewheeling. That's why I say, "Twinning, for life until death..." Can we get help? - He fainted. - Security? Mr. Beaulieu? Now, a highly topical subject with two guests joining us, Régis Bonnot, a stress specialist, and Valérie Ramond, specialist in pressure in politics. I'll be right there. - Well, doctor? - Panic attack. Scary, but not fatal. Has he had a shock recently? He learned he has a black twin his parents abandoned at birth, but that's all. I'm joking! The campaign's stressful. - What now? - Relaxation and rest. He has a prescription. - Thank you. - Goodbye. Goodbye. Are you ok? What are you doing? I don't believe this shit. Get in there. There, to the right. Don't worry, Mr. Beaulieu. A driver without a licence would fuck anyone up. If you need me, I'm free tonight. I have nothing planned. We could go for a drive. Or go bowling. Bowling helps me relax. I often go and... Coming to see an old fart this early, something's wrong. No, I just couldn't sleep last night so I stopped by... Is it your job? Yeah... That's it... He got fired again. He can never stay in a job! - Or you in a care home. - Watch it! That big mouth won't feed you. - What was it? - Driver... You have your licence now? Who's your boss? Grégoire Beaulieu. - I didn't hear. Who? - Grégoire Beaulieu. For God's sake! Grégoire Beaulieu... That old shit's son. He plagued my life. Not just that. - Usinox is a bad idea in your state. - I'm perfectly fine. The doctor told you to rest. You're so tense. The strikers are tense too. We'll loosen up together. - What is this shit thing? - Wait and let it all sink in. No. The show must go on! In politics, only losers do that. Winners go for it! Let's go! Mr. Beaulieu? - Loser! - Die! Die! Please, we're taking a step towards you. Surely we can talk in a more respectful manner. After two months, you visit two days before the election. Isn't that bad timing? No, Mr. Deltor. I've no time to be afraid. I'm here to talk. Let's end this strike. Let's get down to brass tacks. - I was polite! Don't touch me! - Don't come back here, shitbag! Are you happy now? I made a total fool of myself. I told you I wasn't ready for it. - Sorry, but... You're not serious? - Politics, Noémie, politics! It requires anticipation and strategy. It requires a mean streak, but you're sweet as a lamb! Are you crazy? Listen carefully, Grégoire. Listen wonderfully carefully. I've followed you for three years. Three years I've put up with your arrogance. You're unbearable, you never listen, but I've stood by you. Why? Because I'm nice. Maybe. Or maybe I sense a strength in you for doing great things. But I'm not sure now. You find a brother who doesn't match your idea of a brother, and you lose it. You have the mindset of a bowl of water. You can make what you want of this brotherhood. Something beautiful or a nightmare. It's up to you. But carry on like this and you'll hit a wall. Without me. Do we just let her leave? Finding an Uber around here won't be easy... The Bel-Air centre takes flight Out of order Slam the door and I'll sleep on the mat. Good night. Come on. Nice place. - The view's great anyhow. - What do you want? Just get to the point, ok. Oh, no... I don't believe it. Already? Good visit to Usinox? Want a drink? I need one. - It's not vinegar. - I was just looking at... Right... - Listen... - How did our parents meet? - At a concert. - Ok, I get the idea. Classical music, violins, long dresses... - Knacki! - Knacki? - The ad. - It was a flute. - A violin. - A flute. But you come right out with clichés. Not at all, it was Renaud. - Renaud? The singer? - Yes, not the car. What? Upper class means boring stuff, uptight classical music concerts? You come right out with clichés. - Listen... - This'll be boring. Interrupt, and it'll be even more boring. I'm not going to apologize because I'm white... It's boring. ...because I'm Catholic because I'm a rich kid, because I'm right-wing or because my parents abandoned you. Maybe you lost your parents, but I lost... a brother. That's so deep! It was a close call. The tear was here. It nearly fell. One more word and it would've fallen. No! - What? - Seriously? - French singers are sacred in the family. - A signed copy too! - "You'll Find". - My favourite. I know it by heart. - I have an autograph. - Cut it out. I'm really pissed off. By heart, huh? Like everyone I have my flaws I don't always use the right words But if you read between the lines You'll find in my songs Everything I couldn't tell you There are printing errors Hazy ways of saying I love you Despite a lack of harmony You'll find in my songs Everything I didn't dare tell you You'll find My injuries and my weaknesses - Those I barely confess - You'll find My blunders, my clumsiness And more love than is needed I'm so afraid you'll leave me Believe me if I tend to overdo it It's so you'll stay with me Stay with me You'll find My injuries and my weaknesses Those I barely confess My blunders, my clumsiness And more love than is needed I'm so afraid you'll leave me Believe me if I tend to overdo it It's so you'll stay with me Stay with me I like it! I like it! I like it! So, have you made your mind up? About what? My parents... Well, your parents. You don't want to meet them to tell them you know? No. No. I already have a father. Adoptive, but a father anyway. What would I do with two parents who didn't want me? Ok. You know, if I get elected, you can ask me for things. - Whatever you want. - I already asked you. Oh, that thing. That thing... It saved my life. Paul got me off the streets, away from bad company and the shit it causes. Paul was tough, but put us on the straight and narrow. The youth centre was my family. I was there all the time. That's why Paul and Mariette adopted me. I was really born then. '88 is just a date on a document. I think... I'd like us to see each other. We're seeing each other now, right? No, I mean not like this. I mean later, more discreetly... - Discreetly? - That's not what I meant. Undercover, like. In a dark alley, dressed as bums. C'mon, Grégoire... Either I'm your brother or I'm a social disease. You have to decide. Greg! Coffee or decaf? Shit! Did your fibre champion touch the Nespresso? No. - That's funny? - Yes. - I have to change. - Yep. Greg! - That was in Mauritius, right? - Yes. I liked that hat. - And the bikini! - Mauritius, yes. December 21, 1988. How come your stomach was so flat three days before I was born? You know... Often, with some women, you can't really tell... Your mum, with her slim waist, was lucky. Are you serious? We love you, we always have. Have you ever lacked anything? I never said that. I just want to solve this biological mystery. I knew this would happen one day. I said we should have told him. - Patricia... - Told me what? Sit down, honey. Sit down. It's as if... It's as if you had been brought to us by a stork. - A miracle... - Stop, Patricia! Stop that. Storks weren't involved. Since you really want to know... I'm sterile. I fire blanks. We had no choice. Storks are prettier. So I was... adopted. A little... From a strictly technical point of view... - Yes, sort of... - Yes. It changes nothing deep down because we love you. - Like always. - We never found the right time. It was too soon or too late. - For your sake. - To spare you. - That was the reason, right? - Yes. Hold on... If I was adopted, that means you didn't abandon Anthony. - Anthony? - My twin brother. - What? - My black driver. - Mathieu is black now? - No, Anthony is black. - A black driver? - Without a licence. A driver without a licence? What is this shit? It's simple, Pat. Our son Grégoire has a black driver without a licence, who is his twin. Don't you get it? - I didn't know Mum smoked. - I rolled it in '88. She quit when we had you. Good we told him. His lawyer's waiting for us. He says he's in custody. Bruno Fraises... We're in the shit. Bruno FRAISES Lawyer Morand is pressing charges now. What can I do? Look, Bruno, I understand you being upset, but we're here to find a solution, right? - So what do you suggest? - He confesses. He'll get it off his chest. It'll do him good. Admitting your errors leads to redemption. Ok, but that's not a plea, it's more a sermon. - Mr. Fraises, Anthony did nothing. - What do you mean? - He did nothing? - Exactly. Really did nothing? - Yes. - Nothing. That's a real drag. It's complicated. If he did nothing, he's innocent. It's trickier for me. It's the walls. They're like paper. You hear it all. This used to be a waiting room. Good old Bruno. A lawyer. Who'd have thought? At school, it didn't look good. - Why? - Because you weren't very good at... anything. I wasn't? But... between you and me... I don't give a damn about law. I really don't. Do you realize how many laws there are? Way too many. And it's complicated, God, it's complicated... It's hell! That's awkward, isn't it? My thing is badminton. That's my passion. I'm sorry, I can't help you. They have Morand's testimony and Dimitri's blood. Anthony... We're fucked. Noémie, ask Solansse to arrange a confrontation with Morand. Yes, but what'll you do? What Anthony would do for me. Mrs. Fauchard? Sorry, Bruno. It was you? I broke into Morand's place. The DNA proves it. The DNA? Ridiculous! What do you have in common with that... "That" is my twin brother. No... How low can you sink, Beaulieu? Like father, like son. Is it a media thing? To create a buzz? Crazy! This generation is even worse than ours! A buzz is a good idea. Give Deltor a call. He'll love to crucify me. Handcuff me. Don't you dare! What the hell is this bullshit? The night I was attacked, my mother didn't resemble Beaulieu! - What do I do here, Mr. Morand? - You're the cop, not me! Alright... Listen... I didn't want to come to this, but I have no choice. Yes, and? A work session with my assistants. We're focused. What's so... They're motivated. I made no one do blowjobs... do the job... Anthony Girard, Beaulieu's ex-driver, is free. Mr. Morand's confusion about the facts led him to withdraw the charges. Mr. Beaulieu, fainting live on TV, a clash with strikers, a driver arrested... This is a tough campaign. I have nothing to compare it with. Thank you. Excuse me! You made a considerable effort to free Anthony Girard. Bravo. But why exactly? Even if Mr. Girard forgot to say he didn't have a licence, I forgive the desperate act of a man eager to re-enter society. Thank you. So who attacked Mr. Morand? No one attacked Mr. Morand! You're tiring. Any additional questions can be addressed to me directly. I'm Mr. Fraises, Dimitri's lawyer. - Anthony. - Anthony? You really are too much. - Another care home gone. - Don't talk to me about that bitch! Where can I put you now? Here's the white twin. Nature can be a real joker. I still won't vote for you. That's you introduced. Delighted to meet you, Mr. Girard. Everything ok? The care home director threw him out, it's cool. C'mon, all those old farts locked up. - Depressing! - We get it. So what's so urgent? You weren't abandoned. What? They didn't abandon you. In fact, they're not your parents. Nor mine either because I... I was adopted too. Talk about a bummer, buddy. I'm sorry for you, but... Why for me? This thing concerns us both. No, my parents didn't lie to me. It's had time to sink in. I'm not curious or angry. I've moved on. Aren't you interested in finding our mother? Just to know. My mum Mariette lives in a cemetery. I don't want to know. Fine. That was dumb. - What? - I know you inside out. You're dying to go! You make better decisions when you know where you're from. So stop being so pig-headed. Take your deputy with you and find your breeder! Grégoire! - It's ok. - What's ok? Let's find her. You know, Paul, if we'd known Grégoire had a twin, we'd have adopted him too. I'm glad you never knew. Mariette and I would've had less fun without that jerk. - Thanks for having Dad while... - Yes, I understand. While you find your real mother. The one who was there when you were hungry, cold... - Thirsty... For cuddles... - Mum... The one who worried about you, sharing your joys and sorrows. - Who washed your briefs. - Ok, enough. Who never noticed the tissues vanishing under your bed. - Mum... - Do up your seat belts. - Mum! - No! - Mum! - Leave her, Grégoire, she needs time. Thanks for the car. - Are you sorting stuff? - Yes. Try to understand her. Your mum's gone a bit haywire since you know what. - Are you ok? - I'll be fine. Don't worry. It's the emotion... of not knowing if you'll still call me "Dad". No, no, no! No more cuts! No, no, no! No more cuts! It's crazy making me search the archives like this. You're a doll. It's for Anthony. Pretend it's for me. Right... Let's see... December 24th, 1988, right? - No, those are twins. - Let me see the mother's name. - "X". - Of course. The social worker was a Mrs. Hardy. Excellent. Hold on. There's no address? Want her mobile too? Sorry. Thanks anyhow, Prune. Thanks, bro. Wait, Antho! What's all this about twins? I have a twin brother and he's Grégoire Beaulieu. it's crazy. Jeez, he's losing it. - Mind the car. It isn't mine! - Go, guys! - It's my dad's, not mine. - A genius. I'm not here to talk politics today. I'm here on a personal matter. The maternity ward's closing, but I'm not a deputy. - You lost their vote. - Is she the one? Not many social workers are called Marie-France Hardy. - Yes? - Hello. 8Marie-France Hardy? Don't worry. He's in good hands. It's unbelievable. You're so big and handsome. - That's kind. - Alright, here we are. This is the one. BIRTH OF BLACK AND WHITE TWINS The decision to separate you was the hardest I ever made. We discussed it with the head doctor, with the medical staff... But you were in a very critical condition, Anthony. We felt that at least one of you should have a chance of finding a family. Understandable. So I went ahead and organized your adoption, Grégoire, without telling Mr. and Mrs. Beaulieu about your brother. I was worried it would put them off. I'm sorry. It was another time, you know. Then the miracle happened. Anthony survived. You know, I rarely saw a case like it. - Black and white twins? - No. That's a unique case. I meant your mother. How could I forget her? So young, so fragile, and yet so brave. The rare thing is she checked up on you with our department, every year until you turned 18. - Marie-France... - I know what you'll ask. Yes, I have her number. But, no, I don't have the right to give it to you, sorry. We know... I really would like to. But I can't break the law. I know it's hard, but I also know how hard it was for Claire. Want anything else? No, it's ok. I always do the dirty work. Wait. If you do manage to find her... You never know... Remember that a woman who had to take such a painful decision needs a lifetime to recover. You have the right to bear a grudge, of course, but don't judge her too harshly. Thank you. Thanks for everything. No... Mum's black and Dad's white. - No way! - It's true! No, Dad's black. Or they're both white. Or both black. You're nuts! - I'm lucky anyhow. - Yeah? Why? I could've been you! Hold on. It's Noémie. A reminder for tonight's rally. Can you answer her? To say what? Just put, "Don't worry, we'll be on time. Thanks." Don't worry, we'll be on time. Tell me... Noémie and you... Noémie and me? You like her. I don't know. I've never thought about it. Noémie is a colleague. A brilliant one. She makes a great impression. You can't deny it. We met as students and developed a fine professional relationship. I'm proud and happy to work with a friend. - A friend? - Yes, a friend. So I can go ahead and try my luck. - No way. - She's a friend? You got it, a friend. I love you. - What did you add? - "Kisses". Right, "kisses"... Just like that. Alright. This is it. Let's go. - Hold on! - What? We can't just turn up. She may not want to see us. Maybe she expects... She won't eat us. She won't put us back where we came from! Here. - I look ok? - Yeah. Let's go. - Who's he? - No idea. - Can I help you? - Hello! - I know you, you're... - Grégoire Beaulieu. - Right! - And he's your driver. - The driver's a meerkat we put down. - Ah, ok. I'm currently campaigning and I'm out meeting the French at home. You're right. That's a great idea. Is this your district? No, good point, but the regional council sent us. To prepare a possible... May we come in? Yes, of course, sure. Lead the way. Yes, sorry. It's because... Follow me. Try a local cookie. The town's best. And... Do you live here alone? No, I live with my wife. She's here. - Claire! - No, don't disturb her. There's no rush. - After 30 years, we can wait. - It's nicer though. - Claire, can you come down? - Coming! - Well? A bit tense. I can tell. - A bit, yes. A campaign isn't easy. It's a lot of stress and, in no time, the results are in... - It's stressful. - It'll go well. Here's my wife. Alright then. This is Claire. Honey, meet Grégoire Beaulieu. You know, that politician... we like a lot. I'll get the coffee. Hello, ma'am. Grégoire. Anthony Girard. I'm Grégoire's campaign manager. And why did you want to see us? To talk. About my programme... About politics... To meet the French so they can tell us about... the way they see life, well, their lives. To talk about the best and the worst. I'm sorry, but when politicians feign interest in people, it seems populist. That's not the case. Ok, but we don't have much to tell you. Right, Claire? No... Any specific questions? Yes, for example, I don't know... Your profession? I run a computer engineering firm in La Rochelle. So computing, software... - And I'm a freelance nurse. - Yes. There you go. And have you lived here long? Forever. Charente born and bred. And proud of it. Did you meet here? First love, as they say. Married two years after Claire got back from Brazil. Yes, I was at the French high school in Rio for a while. Long ago. Yes, long ago, it was back in '87 or '88. She didn't enjoy it much. - Not much. - No. - The coffee... - Right... No, the coffee's here. As she's a nurse, it can get stressful at times. It's us! Our children, Madeleine and Thomas. You could say hello. - Hello. - There you go, typical teens. They're always... Yes, I understand. It surprises people. Only natural. But it's no big secret. They were adopted. A classic. A series of fruitless IVF attempts. It wears you out. The doctors say, "It's not a physical problem. Maybe it's psychosomatic." They get the idea. - Yes. They're back. - You're a drag! Calm down a bit! They never stop. Where were we? Can you tell us about your programme? It's ok, we won't bother you any longer. We'll go. - You have a nice family. - That's kind of you. I'll see you out. Goodbye. It's... Are you sure? We could lose with this. Or we do it after the elections. We have a short lead in the polls. Noémie! I'm sure. Thanks for the slap. I love you too. Thank you for saying it first. Even if a text message isn't very romantic. That's so cute. Finally! "CHARENTE HEART" Good evening! Thank you. Thank you, everyone! A long campaign. So, for starters, I'd like to thank you all for coming this evening. Before talking about what concerns us, let me tell you briefly about myself and about... about my family. How can I put it? I was adopted. There. I found out just recently that I was adopted by Patrice and Patricia Beaulieu, my dear parents whom I love and who have always given me everything, and done everything for me. But... that's not all, as I also learned I have a brother. A twin brother, to be precise. He came into my life not that long ago and I'd like him to join me. Anthony? - Anthony? - You're nuts. No. - Yes, go on. - Come on. Sorry, he's shy. - There's something else. - What? - He doesn't have his licence. - Here he is. My brother. I hid him because... I was scared. Scared of not knowing how to handle such an upheaval in my life because... it's a big thing. But I've finally decided to share this wonderful news with you. Can I say something? Sure. - Good evening. - Good evening. Obviously, discovering a twin brother is amazing. When you hear that he's white, you don't believe it. Tonight, I'm thinking... we're thinking of a 17-year-old girl who gave up Grégoire and me on Christmas Eve. It's not be the gift we wanted, but it wasn't easy for her. She did what she felt was best for us. I'd like to tell her... we don't judge her and don't hold it against her. Thank you. Grégoire! Grégoire! My dear friends... After all these years fighting against all the odds, I'm happy to tell you that I've finally won this fight for you. What a fraud! Therefore, I am extremely proud to open this wonderful, magnificent and necessary Paul Girard youth centre named in honour and memory of a man who, for 30 years, was its key driving force and whose son, Anthony, takes up the torch so energetically now. More than a meeting place, it's the very heart of this housing project that is now renovated. It was high time. And so, I wish you every success, my dear Anthony. More money poured down the drain... Thank you! Thank you, Mr Morand.! Thank you for your trust in me and, above all, for your generosity. You promised the centre would reopen and, as both you and I know, your word is your guarantee. You little bastard... Dad would've loved to be here. He's watching from where he is now. So he can hear us, I'd like us to applaud, with all our might, the Paul Girard youth centre. - Thank you, Morand! - Get your hands off. - Great speech. So moving. - So sincere. Cut it out. Beaulieu, did you give your son the photos? I did one term as mayor, but I kept my contacts. I love the one with the feathers. Yes, very decorative. Not easy to wear, but... Pathetic. Absolutely pathetic. What are those two jerks doing with my daughter? Excuse me. Come here. Tell me, Beaulieu, how did you get Morand to reopen this centre? Easy. I blackmailed him. He had no choice. Ok, he's totally frank all the time now... - Show us round, Mr. Director? - Let's go. Yes! - Can I have a word? - We'll catch up. See you later. - Cool speech. - Thanks. - You and Noémie look good. - Yes... Is it going well? Pretty well. - Thanks for the text. - Yes. Thanks. Talking of Noémie... - I wanted to tell you.. - Ok, you know. I knew from the start but couldn't tell you... - The start of what? - She's our twin. No... - It's the eyes. - No... - Ok, what is it? - I wanted to tell you... You're going to be an uncle.
