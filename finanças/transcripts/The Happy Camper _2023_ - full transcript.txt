[music playing] [music playing] >> Waiter: Another order of avocado toast while we wait? >> Dillon: No thank you. My boyfriend should be here any minute. Wait. Can I ask you a question? If a guy you've been seeing for a long time asks you out to dinner but stands you up consistently, what would you do? >> Waiter: Dump the guy. Pick a new one. >> Brandon: Hey! Dillon! >> Dillon: It's like the apocalypse in here. What's happening? >> Brandon: What? >> Dillon: What is going on? >> Brandon: Sorry. Uh, yeah. I've been meaning to talk to you about that. So... >> Dillon: Well, I waited for an hour and a half at the restaurant. That would've been a nice place to talk. >> Brandon: Right. Dinner. Uh, I'm sorry. It's just-- It's been one of those days. >> Dillon: What is happening? >> Brandon: Listen. I want you to know that everything I'm doing here and, um, I'm about to do is for us. >> Dillon: You're shredding documents for us? >> Brandon: Exactly. >> Dillon: I have so many questions right now. Please tell me WooWoo's not shutting down. >> Brandon: No, no, no. Of course not. I'm just pushing that pause button for a second. I gotta go find some Class B funding. >> Dillon: Class B? What happened to Class A? >> Brandon: Peter Bright decided to pull the plug this morning. >> Dillon: Our angel investor? >> Brandon: Not so angelic anymore. More like the horn and tail guy now. He said the WooWoo wasn't scaling fast enough for his taste. I don't know. >> Dillon: Well, did you pitch him all my ideas on how to generate more leads? >> Brandon: Uh. He was yelling a lot, so I didn't really get a chance. >> Dillon: Brandon. I didn't even know we were having money problems. >> Brandon: I didn't want you to worry. Besides, I already have some meetings lined up with new money back east. I'm gonna pitch them my new marketing handle. >> Dillon: What new marketing handle? >> Brandon: Okay, listen. Your idea, it's great. It's just not really working anymore. The art to your heart thing. I came up with this. >> Dillon: The app to your lap? What's wrong with it? Okay, well, I'm going to hop on a plane as soon as I vacate this building and get rid of literally any trace that I was even here, so-- >> Dillon: Including firing everyone? >> Brandon: Mm-mm. Don't say the F word. A leave of absence is a much nicer term. What? This happens to startups all the time. It's fine. It doesn't even matter because it's only temporary. What is that they say? When you shoot for the moon and you miss, it only makes you stronger. >> Dillon: Or sucks you into the cold vacuum of space. >> Brandon: [Chuckles] Here. I want to give you this. >> Dillon: What's this? >> Brandon: Just some walking around money. It should last you for a few weeks. Worst case, like, months. >> Dillon: Awesome. So, I'm fired too? >> Brandon: Ah, leave of absence, right? No more F word in this space. But no. No, no. You are my most valuable coder, okay? >> Dillon: And girlfriend. >> Brandon: Of course. I could never forget that part. Listen, just think of this as like a short vacation from being employed. Meanwhile, I'm going to be off finding a new champion to get this business back up and going. >> Dillon: Okay. >> Brandon: Yes. That's my girl. Our future is right around the corner, baby. It's right around the next corner. I promise. >> Reba: Hey girlfriend. I thought you were going out with app boy Brandon. >> Dillon: Yeah, so did I. >> Reba: What do you mean? Everything okay? >> Dillon: Brandon stood me up, then handed me an envelope full of cash. >> Reba: Oh no he didn't. >> Dillon: Yeah. Apparently, WooWoo's having money issues. Class A funding is gone. So now, he's off looking for Class B. >> Reba: I don't get it. I thought that app was making more love connections than Dr. Phil. >> Dillon: Yeah, so did I. >> Reba: That's not right. It was your coding that launched that app. He should have kept you in the loop. >> Dillon: Thank you. >> Reba: I'm sorry, baby. It's time for black licorice ice cream. >> Dillon: You know me so well. >> Reba: I do. >> Dillon: Can I have that too? >> Reba: Yes, you may. >> Dillon: Thank you. [Phone buzzing] >> Dillon: Hello. >> Margot: Dilly. You sound almost happy that I'm calling. That makes me feel good. >> Dillon: Hello, Margot. You came up as unknown on my caller ID. >> Margot: Gotcha. It wouldn't kill you to call me mom. >> Dillon: Nope, you just have to earn it. >> Margot: Okay, I deserve that. >> Dillon: Besides, I rarely hear from you, and when I do, it's really bad news. But to be honest, I've had enough of that for today. >> Margot: What happened? >> Dillon: I would rather not get into that with you. Is grandpa okay? >> Margot: He's at the farm now. I came to check on him. I guess he's fine. >> Dillon: Okay. >> Margot: I'm just concerned about his eating. You know what he had for dinner? >> Dillon: No. >> Margot: Corndogs. Three of them. >> Dillon: Margo, there's nothing wrong with grandpa eating corndogs. He could use some comfort food considering how much work he puts in at the farm. >> Margot: It's not gonna be too comforting when he gets diabetes, or heart disease, and or cancer and keels over because of disgusting fats and nitrates. >> Dillon: When did you become a nutritionist? >> Margot: I'm not, but I am a vegan now. I'm going to do everything I can to convert your grandpa to a healthy, informed plant-based diet. >> Dillon: Good luck with that. I know you just didn't call me to talk about grandpa's corndogs. >> Margot: No. I called because he said he really misses you. I figured you'd want to know. You used to be so close. >> Dillon: Uh, yeah. Him and grandma raised me. >> Margot: Thank you for reminding me I'll never win mother of the year. >> Dillon: I didn't mean it like that. >> Margot: It's fine. Anyway, I know he would love to see you, but I'm sure with your crazy work schedule, it's just not in the cards right now. >> Dillon: Actually, right now might be a perfect time for a visit to Colorado. >> Margot: Oh.

I only have like one bar of 3G. >> Jordan: Not from around here? >> Dillon: Actually, I am. I've just been in Portland for a few years. >> Jordan: Oh. Well, yeah. The new interstate they built, it bypassed all the old cutoffs. >> Dillon: Oh. >> Jordan: Welcome back to Silverdale. I'm, uh, I'm Jordan. >> Dillon: I figured. [Chuckles] I'm Dillon. >> Jordan: Dillon. Dillon Michaels. >> Dillon: Yeah, how did you-- >> Jordan: We had second grade together. >> Dillon: Little Jordan Moore? With the mullet? >> Jordan: That's me. Business in the front, party in the back. >> Dillon: All grown up. >> Jordan: Yeah. Yeah, you too. So, what brings you back to Silverdale? >> Dillon: Uh, just visiting my grandpa. >> Jordan: That's good. That's really good.

[music playing] >> Dillon: Hello? Anybody home? >> Alexander: Dilly? Is that really you? >> Dillon: Hi, grandpa. It's so good to see you. >> Alexander: Man, you are a sight for sore eyes. >> Dillon: How are you? >> Alexander: Well, it depends on who you ask. According to your mother, I'm on death's door, but now that you're here, I could go two-stepping. >> Dillon: I hope it's okay that I came like this. I wanted to surprise you. >> Alexander: Are you kidding? This will always be your home. How long can you stay? Please tell me for a long time. >> Dillon: Well, right now, I can stay as long as I want. >> Alexander: What about your job? >> Dillon: Kind of in a holding pattern. Sort of like the rest of my life. But I'm back with my grandpa, and that's all that matters. What is that? >> Alexander: Your mother. >> Dillon: Yeah, I saw her camper outside. Is she still here? >> Alexander: I guess she didn't tell you. >> Dillon: Tell me what? >> Alexander: She's moved in. >> Dillon: She's living here? >> Alexander: Since last month. >> Dillon: What about Don? >> Alexander: Oh, that was last year. This year was Ron. Apparently, any man's name that rhymes with yawn is past tense. >> Margot: Dilly. You actually came. >> Dillon: And you actually didn't tell me you lived here. >> Margot: Must've slipped my mind. Anyway, I'm cooking dinner. Why don't you get settled and get everything on the table? >> Dillon: [Whispers] I'm not eating that. I'm having an Oingo Boingo flashback, and I was even born yet. >> Alexander: I'm sorry your mom took over your old bedroom. We could put you in your grandma's old sewing room, except it's turned into storage the last few years. >> Dillon: I'll just sleep on the couch. She pulled out that photo of dad again? >> Alexander: She does that every time a relationship goes south. [music playing] So, what's on the dinner menu? >> Margot: Mmm. Roasted eggplant stuffed with quinoa, kale, and shallots. >> Alexander: Any of that rabbit food I could dip in ranch dressing. >> Margot: Not a chance, Dad. You are a walking dietary nightmare, and I am hazmat cleanup. >> Alexander: So rich and filling. Well, both my girls are home together at the same time. My life is full. Not my stomach. >> Dillon: So, Margot. Grandpa tells me you are single again. >> Margot: Long story, Dilly. Let's just say that I'm at peace with my life. >> Dillon: What happened? >> Margot: It's not important. What is important that is now I have taken a vow to only soar with eagles. >> Alexander: Better than running with the turkeys. >> Margot: What about you and app guy? I saw pictures on social media. Looks like you're in love. >> Dillon: His name is Brandon. And yes, we are taking some time apart from the business, but I know he intends to marry me very soon. >> Margot: At least you still believe in happily ever after. >> Dillon: Somebody has to. Otherwise, the world would be a very sad place. >> Alexander: I agree. Your grandma and I woke up every morning cherishing our lives together. >> Margot: I do hope it works out for you, Dilly. >> Alexander: Me too, sweetheart. >> Dillon: So what do you plan on doing now that you're back at the farm? >> Alexander: Yeah, I was wondering that too. You never did like farm life. >> Margot: People can change, can't they? >> Dillon: Theoretically. >> Margot: Well, then you will both be happy to hear that I'm starting my own home business, and all I need is the garden outside. >> Alexander: What for? >> Margot: I'm going to grow lavender, and make lavender products, and bless people with lotions, and soaps, and candles. >> Alexander: And the farming part? You gonna till, plant, irrigate, harvest all by yourself? >> Margot: Absolutely because I have done my homework. >> Alexander: Where? On YouTube? >> Margot: Dad, don't knock YouTube. I also taught myself Japanese on YouTube. And this new business is going to be suburashi, which means splendid, excellent, fantastic. In case you didn't know. >> Alexander: Welcome home, Dilly. [music playing] [Moo] [Rooster crow] >> Dillon: [Groans] I'm too young for back pain. [music playing] >> Dillon: Hey, grandpa. >> Alexander: Good morning, Dillon. You brought in the sunshine. And you look like a proper farm girl now. I see you found your grandma's old boots. >> Dillon: I did, and they're a perfect fit. Figured I'm going to need something more than high heels if I'm gonna be walking around the farm for who knows how long. >> Alexander: Who knows how long sounds just right to me. >> Dillon: Well, if Margot and I can keep from strangling each other. >> Alexander: Oh, come on. Hey, give me a hand here, will you? >> Dillon: Grandpa. I love your barn. Anybody in the world can have a problem, and you'd have the tool to fix it. >> Alexander: That barn there, that was your grandma Alice's happy place. When we decided she could take over the upstairs and turn it into a wedding venue, she was in heaven. Made her so happy to bless the young couple with a beautiful place to start a life together. Wish I could see that again. >> Dillon: I know. Me too. >> Alexander: For all the good times we had in there, my favorite is still your 12th birthday party. >> Dillon: That was a good one. >> Alexander: You and your friends couldn't break up open that pinata no matter how hard they tried. >> Dillon: No until you got your chainsaw. And then we got the candy out. Yep. That was the last time Margo and I were under the same roof. Two weeks later, she left. >> Alexander: I know you and your mom aren't on the best of terms. >> Dillon: Grandpa, we're not on any terms. How could we be? After she went off searching for her truth, I only heard from her what? Once a year if I was lucky. >> Alexander: I know, Dilly, but always try to give her a little grace. When your daddy died over there in the Iraqi desert, she never quite got over it. >> Dillon: Yeah, I didn't either. I was a kid and she was an adult, yet she was the one that went off searching for her purpose, and her purpose was right here all along. You and grandma raised me better than she could've ever. Now she's back, acting like nothing is wrong, wanting us to be a big, happy family on a lavender farm? I don't think so. >> Alexander: Yeah, but for what it's worth, I get the feeling she's really trying to do the right thing this time. >> Dillon: Yeah? Like taking over my room and taking down my Backstreet Boys posters? >> Alexander: Let me show you something. Come here. What do you think? >> Dillon: Is that yours? >> Alexander: You remember my friend, Jack Barbie, from the Silverdale Lodge? >> Dillon: Yeah. >> Alexander: He left me this trailer when he passed several years ago. I really didn't know what to do with it. It's just been sitting here. >> Dillon: Can I look inside? >> Alexander: I was hoping you'd ask. Yeah, I know. It's pretty-- >> Dillon: Amazing. >> Alexander: I was gonna say pigsty, but sure, let's go with amazing. >> Dillon: No, I love it. It's so retro. You could fix it up, and sell it, and make a pretty buck. >> Alexander: I don't want to sell it. >> Dillon: Why not? >> Alexander: Because I want to give it to you. >> Dillon: Wait, really? >> Alexander: I know that couch is a backbreaker. I was thinking if you could fix it up and bring it back to its glory days. Well, that way you and Margot could each have your own space around here. >> Dillon: My own '61 Shasta. I love it. >> Alexander: Well, it needs a lot of TLC. >> Dillon: All of a sudden, I've got a lot of that and time available, so-- Thank you, grandpa. >> Alexander: Don't thank me yet. Wait until you see how much work you got yourself into. >> Dillon: Extreme Makeover Camper Edition. I can do that.

I'm off to the hardware store in Silverdale. >> Margot: Oh, you mean the one run by the young man with the muscles. >> Dillon: I hadn't noticed. >> Margot: Anyway, could you pick up a few things for me for my lavender patch? >> Dillon: You got money? >> Margot: I do. >> Dillon: Soaker hoses, green sand. I don't know what half of this stuff is. >> Margot: Neither do I. That's part of the fun. It's a new adventure. My card. >> Dillon: Okay. >> Margot: Pick something up for yourself, like some candy. It's on me. >> Dillon: What am I, five? >> Margot: I wish. >> Jordan: Really great seeing you guys. Thanks for letting me close a little early today. Have a good one. >> Vivian: Hey, Jordan. Closing a little early today? >> Jordan: Yeah. I gotta run some errands, Vivian. >> Vivian: Hey, I bet you haven't had dinner yet. So, when you are all done with your errands, you wanna join me? Luciana's is having live music tonight. >> Jordan: As much as I love Luciana's. We went there every Friday night for a year, remember? Then you ghosted me. >> Vivian: Oh, come on. That was my ambivalent phase. >> Jordan: And you're much more decisive now? >> Vivian: Only when it comes to you. Absolutely. >> Jordan: Look, I'm going to my ambivalent phase right now. Besides, I have a family commitment tonight, so I'm gonna have to pass, alright? >> Vivian: Dinner with Aunt Donna? >> Jordan: Yeah, how do you know that? >> Vivian: Jordan, I know everything that goes on in this town, especially when it comes to you. So don't ever forget that. [music playing] >> Jordan: Well, did you find your way home. >> Dillon: I did thanks to you. >> Jordan: What can I do for you? >> Dillon: I was hoping to get some supplies. >> Jordan: I'm closing up early today. I'm sorry. Here, let me take a look at that. Wow. No, I can be a half-hour late to dinner. Or an hour. >> Dillon: Are you sure? I wouldn't want to put you out. >> Jordan: No, you know. In the second grade, you didn't hit me with my He-Man lunch pail when I wiped peanut butter and jelly all over your face. >> Dillon: Wait, you remember that? >> Jordan: I do. You installing drip irrigation? >> Dillon: Not me. Margot. The woman that gave birth to me. >> Jordan: So, your mom. >> Dillon: Technically speaking. She's installing a lavender farm and I am renovating a trailer. >> Jordan: Really? That's cool. I have one myself. A lot of people around here do. It's kind of one of those regional geek out things that a lot of folks love to do. Mine's a 1958 Holiday Traveler. It takes a little upkeep, but I love that old thing. >> Dillon: Yeah, my grandpa tells me mine is a '61 Shasta. >> Jordan: Oh, really? That's a sweet one. I'd like to see that sometime. >> Dillon: Yeah, for sure. So, you never left Silverdale? >> Jordan: No, I did for a while. I went to college back east, but you get the boy out of the town. You cannot get the town of the boy. So, came back here and took over for my uncle Chuck after he retired. >> Dillon: Oh, yeah. I remember that. Check Moore. >> Jordan: I figured carpe diem. I just needed a do-over. You ever feel that way? >> Dillon: Oh, yeah. Over and over again. >> Jordan: So, what do you do back in Portland? >> Dillon: I am a programmer for a tech startup. It's a dating app where people send emojis. >> Jordan: Wait. WooWoo? Are you serious? >> Dillon: Yeah. >> Jordan: The art to your heart app? >> Dillon: You know it? >> Jordan: Yeah, I tried it for about two minutes, and then someone sent me a scary clown emoji and I bailed. No offense. >> Dillon: None taken. Yeah, we're having cash issues right now, so we're temporarily shut down until we can reboot. >> Jordan: Well, I'm glad it brought you back to Silverdale, at least for a little while. >> Dillon: So am I. >> Jordan: Well, let me know how the restoration work goes on the Shasta. >> Dillon: It's a date. I mean, not a date date. It's an update. I will update you on my progress. >> Jordan: Okay. >> Chelsea: Dillon? Dillon Michaels, is that really you? >> Dillon: Chesley Willets? >> Chelsea: Oh my gosh. >> Dillon: Wow, it's been forever. >> Chelsea: You're not kidding. >> Dillon: How have you been? >> Chelsea: Amazing. A little crazy and chaotic, but amazing. Actually, I've got 30 minutes before I gotta go back in full mom mode, but would you want to have coffee? >> Dillon: With me? >> Chelsea: Absolutely. >> Dillon: Sure. [music playing] >> Vivian: Hi there. I'm Vivian. Can I help you? >> Dillon: Hi. Yeah, I'm looking for some items for a trailer that I'm renovating. >> Vivian: Ooh. What sort of trailer? >> Dillon: A '61 Shasta. >> Vivian: Love it. Okay. Well, was sort of motif are you going for? Shabby chic? Midcentury modern? >> Dillon: I don't know yet. All I know is that I love the vintage appliances and I'd love to get some things that go with it. >> Vivian: Adorable. Wow, sounds like you have yourself quite the find there. Those vintage appliances, they are very rare, but you can do anything you want to with a trailer like that. There are no rules. Unless, of course, you want to enter into our local trailer fest competition. >> Dillon: A trailer fest? >> Vivian: Oh yeah. We do it every year around here. It is very cutthroat. [Chuckles] But like in a very friendly, happy camper sort of way. >> Dillon: Oh, thanks for the tip, but I'm not really a cutthroaty type of person. >> Vivian: Something for you here. >> Dillon: My grandma left me old ruby jewelry. It looks just like this. >> Vivian: Okay, alright. So, beautiful vintage motif, red and white. We call that the Route 66 pallet, and I have so many things that would be perfect with that. Um, oh my gosh. Anything here really. >> Dillon: I'll just start with this. >> Vivian: I'll tell you what. You know what? You're a new customer, so I'm gonna offer you an exclusive discount. Today only, everything that you get is gonna be 20 percent off. >> Dillon: Oh wow. Thank you. That 20 percent did not go far. >> Vivian: Well, you definitely found yourself some amazing inspiration pieces. Hey, when you're all done with this reno, I am dying to see pics. I also just so happen to be on the trailer fest organizing committee. >> Dillon: Oh, so you are the cutthroat type. >> Vivian: Count on it, honey. >> Chelsea: So, what have you been up to? >> Dillon: Just visiting my grandpa. >> Chelsea: Great. How long are you gonna be around? >> Dillon: Kind of up in the air right now. I'm not really sure. >> Chelsea: Listen, do you need a few hours of work weekday afternoons? Because I happen to know a part-time job that is right up your alley. >> Dillon: What is that? >> Chelsea: I run the community center now, and our kids' choir instructor just retired. So, you can relive your glory days teaching kids how to belt out show tunes for the grandparents. >> Dillon: Oh my gosh. I have been coding for so long that I don't even know if I have vocal cords anymore. >> Chelsea: Lord knows I can't find anybody else in this town that could hold a tune, and then I run into you. It's like a message from heaven. >> Dillon: Or a coincidence. >> Chelsea: No such thing. Coincidences are just mini miracles. >> Dillon: I mean, I guess could use a few extra dollars. [music playing] >> Janelle: Hi. >> Dillon: Hi. >> Janelle: You're the new teacher? >> Dillon: Yes. >> Janelle: So, my kids have kind of a hard time acclimating to group activities. It's a long story. This is Chloe. This is Owen. >> Dillon: Don't worry. Choir's a great equalizer. Super low pressure. We'll figure it out together. >> Janelle: Thank you. I wish I could stay, but I have a real estate showing in like 15 minutes, so-- >> Dillon: You're fine. >> Janelle: Be brave, guys. Love you. >> Dillon: Okay. Can you guys go over there for me? Just over to the corner. Yeah. >> Excuse me, Dillon. Hi, yes. Mrs. Stevens has made some choices about who the solos were, and my daughter, Gemma, she's just been practicing her little heart out. >> Dillon: Well, I'll have to review those choices, but I'm sure what Gemma wants Gemma will get. Before we start singing, we need to align our bodies properly. So, what I want you to do is I want you to take your right ear to your right shoulder. That's really good, Owen, but let's try your other right ear. Yes, perfect. Okay. Now let's try to have our left ear to our left shoulder. Yes. Yes, really good. Okay, now take your chinny chin chin down to your chest. >> Excuse me. What does this have to do with singing? >> Dillon: Well, for safety, we need to align their vertebrae properly so that Gemma doesn't pinch a nerve while she's doing her solo. Okay. Now let's finish up with super duper double bubblegum. ♪ Super duper double bubblegum. ♪ ♪ >> All: Super duper double bubblegum. ♪ ♪ Super duper double bubblegum. ♪ ♪ Super duper double bubblegum. ♪ >> Dillon: So good! Great job. Well, I will see you next class. And next week, we will get back to singing Meet Me in St. Louis. Oh, and before you go, don't forget to stop by Mrs. Clark. She has some super duper double bubblegum for you guys. Jordan? >> Jordan: Dillon? >> Dillon: What are you doing here? >> Jordan: I could ask you the same thing. >> Dillon: This is my new part-time job. I'm teaching choir. >> Jordan: Okay. Hey, what's up, guys? Good to see you. Hey, how are you doing? >> Owen: Good. >> Jordan: Janelle's still at her showing, so she asked me to pick up the kids. Hey, how's the trailer reno going? >> Dillon: Fine. >> Jordan: Okay. You know, I really enjoyed helping you shop at my store the other day. >> Dillon: I'll see you guys next class, yeah? >> Jordan: Okay. Well, it's time to go, kids. Thanks, Dillon. [music playing] It's got good bones The place is nice and the time is right A good time to own The bank checked out We got approved to spend a few And put some money down Own a little piece of town Oak tree in the back With a white picket fence wrapped around it It might not be much, but it's enough to settle down in I want to fix this place up for you and me Cover the walls with pictures full of memories See how much love We can fit in a couple of acres A couple homemakers Just a couple homemakers Just a couple homemakers >> Dillon: I think between these two. I don't think the yellow. Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes. >> Jordan: Howdy again. Need some help? >> Dillon: I am thinking apple red trim over white for the exterior. >> Jordan: Solid choice. Route 66 look. >> Dillon: Yeah, you know. It's kind of a permanent choice, kinda like marriage. >> Jordan: I guess. You can always experiment though. You don't want to get tied down to just one color scheme until you've really locked in the right one. >> Dillon: Wow. That's how I thought you'd answer. [music playing] >> Reba: Dillon. How's Colorado? >> Dillon: Reminding more and more of the big city every day. >> Reba: Everything okay? >> Dillon: Uh-huh. >> Reba: Wait, I know that uh-huh. Is some dude hitting on you there? >> Dillon: You could say that. >> Reba: Is he cute? >> Dillon: Yep. >> Reba: Is he there with you right now? >> Dillon: Uh-huh. >> Reba: Girlfriend, girlfriend. Pay attention to the warning signs. Go back. Severe tire damage ahead. >> Dillon: Planning on it. >> Reba: What about Brandon? Have you heard from him? >> Dillon: No, zip, nothing, nada. >> Reba: Well, you have enough men problems, so when it comes to this Colorado Casanova, just say no. Got it? >> Dillon: Trust me, I am way ahead of you. >> Reba: Okay. I love you. >> Dillon: I love you too, Reb. >> Jordan: Alright. Well, I think you have everything you need to refinish your exterior. >> Dillon: Thank you. Do you know anyone that can help me with that? Someone I could hire? >> Jordan: Yeah. Me. I'd be happy to lend a hand. >> Dillon: I'm sure you would. >> Jordan: Pardon? >> Dillon: How are Chloe and Owen? >> Jordan: Oh, they're great. They love being in your choir. >> Dillon: And what does their mom think? >> Jordan: Janelle? She thinks your peaches. So do I. >> Dillon: What would she think about you helping me with my trailer? >> Jordan: Why would she care? >> Dillon: Never mind. I can't afford you anyway. >> Jordan: I'm really cheap. >> Dillon: Gee, what a shock. Okay, here's the deal. I do need help with the exterior, but that's all we're doing. I'm not doing dinner. I'm not that kinda girl. >> Jordan: What kind of girl is that? >> Dillon: I will pay retail for the paint and I will pay cash for the labor, but that's it. Just business. Nothing more. >> Jordan: Uh, okay. >> Dillon: I will see you my grandfather's tomorrow at 7:30 AM, tomorrow morning. [music playing] >> Margot: I'm not about to let you two go to work on an empty stomach. Get ready for my cheesy tofu breakfast scramble. >> Alexander: That's not breakfast, dear. That's drywall paste. >> Margot: Stop whining, daddy. >> Alexander: And that's not cheese either. There's a whole lot of mice out there staging a protest. >> Jordan: It looks very tasty, ma'am. I was always taught to be thankful for what was put in front of me, so thank you for your hospitality. >> Margot: I like him. >> Dillon: I'm sure his family does too. >> Alexander: Jordan, how do you like taking over your uncle's store? >> Jordan: Well, I didn't know how I was gonna feel when I first came home, but now that I'm into it, I really feel like it's what I was always meant to do. >> Alexander: Glad to hear that. >> Margot: Jordan, thank you for stepping up to help my Dilly Dilly fix up her trailer. >> Dillon: Thank you very much for that. >> Margot: What? You can tell me by my first name I can call you Dilly Dilly. >> Dillon: Well, as much as I have loved these fake eggs, I'm going to get started. >> Jordan: Oh. Well, I probably shouldn't let her get too far in front of me, so thanks again, ma'am. Appreciate it. Thank you. >> Margot: That didn't go so well. >> Alexander: Maybe try real eggs next time. [music playing] >> Jordan: Knock, knock. Whoa! Okay, this is gorgeous. You did all this yourself? >> Dillon: Uh, yeah, with a little help from Vivian at Sweetwater. >> Jordan: Oh, he met Vivian. >> Dillon: You know her? >> Jordan: Unfortunately, yes. >> Dillon: Well, you do get around. >> Jordan: What's that? >> Dillon: Nothing. >> Jordan: You know, your color scheme is great here. These red appliances are killer. You have a really good eye for this kind of thing. So, I was thinking. With the Trailer Fest coming up, I could really use a refresh on my own trailer. >> Dillon: Yeah, Vivian told me about that. >> Jordan: Oh, yeah. It's great. We all get our trailers together. We spiff them up. We hand out awards. Kind of our last hurrah before winter sets in. >> Dillon: Sounds fun. Should we get started? >> Jordan: Uh. Okay. So, this is a 16-footer. We're gonna need a lot more of that white rust prevent paint than I thought, but, you know, I think we should have enough for the first coat. >> Dillon: First coat? >> Jordan: Oh yeah. The exterior requires at least two, but with both of us working, we should be able to get it done in a day. I just need to mask and tape the windows first. And then, I'll handle the airless gun, and you can keep the paint bucket full. >> Dillon: Okay, let's get it over with. >> Jordan: Dillon, I'm not gonna bite. >> Dillon: Yeah, I know. >> Jordan: Just hold that right there. >> Dillon: Dude, really? >> Jordan: What? >> Dillon: Are you serious? I don't know a pack of wolves you were raised by, but I do not date married men. >> Jordan: I'm glad to hear that, Dillon. I'd be disappointed with you if I did. >> Dillon: Okay, yet here you are still flirting with me. My Lord. Poor Janelle. How did she end up with a guy like you? >> Jordan: Yeah, poor Janelle. >> Dillon: You're beautiful, loving-- >> Jordan: Big sister. >> Dillon: What? >> Jordan: I guess you don't really remember a lot about my family from second grade, but don't you remember Janelle, my older sister? She was a fourth-grader. She works a lot these days, so sometimes, and I know this is scandalous, I pick up Owen and Chloe for her. Sorry for touching you. >> Dillon: It's not funny. >> Jordan: It's pretty funny. No wonder you were acting so weird. >> Dillon: What was I supposed to do? A married man was flirting with me. >> Jordan: Okay, you were flirting back a little bit there for a little while. >> Dillon: No, I-- I was being friendly. >> Jordan: You're right, it was more friendly than it was flirty. >> Dillon: You missed a piece. >> Jordan: Here, let a friend help you. It goes right there. >> Dillon: Hmm. You know what? >> Jordan: No, you're not doing that. >> Dillon: I am. >> Jordan: Friends don't let friends run their mouth off. >> Dillon: This is going to hurt when I take it off. >> Brandon: Dillon. It's great to see you, Dillon. >> Dillon: Brandon? >> Brandon: So, this is where you grew up. It's lovely. In a flyover sort of way. >> Jordan: Hey. Jordan Moore. >> Brandon: Brandon Kranze. >> Dillon: My boss. >> Jordan: Oh. Dillon, I think I need to get back to the store. I'll be back, all right? >> Dillon: I thought we were doing the first coat. >> Jordan: No. I'll be back later. >> Brandon: Hey, Jason, good to meet you, buddy. >> Dillon: It's Jordan. >> Brandon: So, who is he to you? >> Dillon: He is an old classmate and he runs the hardware store, so he's helping me with my trailer. What are you doing here? >> Brandon: I wanted you to be the first to know. I had a very good meeting with an investor, Mr. Avery in Boston, which means that we are back in business. >> Dillon: That's great, but-- >> Brandon: Maybe you didn't just hear me. WooWoo's back, okay? And so are you. >> Dillon: Guess we're not painting today. >> Margot: Brandon, it has been so nice to finally meet you. >> Brandon: Likewise. I see now where Dillon gets her good looks. >> Alexander: Congratulations by the way. I heard you got new financing for your business. >> Brandon: Thank you. >> Alexander: I'm just curious. How did you go broke so quickly. >> Dillon: Dad. >> Brandon: Yeah, it's okay. What did Thomas Edison say when he was inventing the light bulb? I haven't failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that didn't work. >> Alexander: Yeah. No. No, I don't think a dating app is quite the same thing as the guy who managed to figure out how to light up the world. >> Brandon: Fair enough. But you know that failure is actually the mother of invention in the tech industry. If at first you don't succeed, all you need is a couple hundred bucks to a buy new LLC and you're back to the races again. >> Margot: Certainly sounds exciting. >> Brandon: It is. >> Alexander: Dilly, does this mean you're going back to Portland? >> Dillon: I don't know yet, grandpa. >> Margot: Well, you're welcome to stay here while you hash out the details. >> Brandon: No. That's fine. I actually have a room at the Redwing Motor Lodge in town. >> Alexander: Much better. I mean, it's a great place to stay. >> Brandon: This is super cool. It's awesome, but I should probably get checked in. So, Dillon, do you wanna show me around Silverdale? I'd really love to talk to you about how much this new round of funding's gonna mean for us. WooWoo and us personally. >> Dillon: Okay. >> Brandon: People around here sure do love their trailers, huh? What else they got on display? The world's biggest ball of string? >> Dillon: Okay, Portland. >> Brandon: I bet I'm right though, yeah? >> Dillon: No, it's the vintage trailer competition to see who has the fanciest trailer. They do it every year. >> Brandon: Is that why you're painting that old trailer in the barn? >> Dillon: No. I'm gonna live in it. >> Brandon: [Chuckles] Oh, you're serious. >> Dillon: Yeah, why not? >> Brandon: Because you need to come back to the app with me. I need you, Dillon. >> Dillon: Brandon, back at dinner when you were so excited to restart the business, I couldn't help but to realize that you've never talked about us that way. >> Brandon: I told, babe. You're the whole reason that I'm doing all of this. >> Dillon: Yeah, I know that, but that drive, and that passion, that mission, that's what made me fall in love with you in the first place. Now it's the thing that's making us feel far apart. >> Brandon: Whoa, stop. Are you breaking up with me? >> Dillon: No, I'm saying that being back home has put a lot of things in perspective, and I just need time to figure it all out. >> Brandon: Okay. So, what? You're gonna live like a nomad with no job in the middle of armpit Colorado? >> Dillon: That's really helping you. Brandon, this is where I grew up. This is my home. >> Brandon: Yeah, I'm sorry. >> Dillon: I love it here. >> Brandon: You're right. I'm sorry. That was just the millennial in me not getting my way. >> Dillon: Do you ever just want a do-over? >> Brandon: Yes. And a do-over is what we're about to do with WooWoo, Dylan. We can have the same thing together as a couple too. Maybe that's what we need the most, just that big, happy wedding you were always hoping for. >> Dillon: Don't even go there. Brandon, you've been skirting around the commitment for two years. >> Brandon: I know, but I'm here now, aren't I? >> Dillon: Look, your hotel's just up the street. >> Brandon: Okay, but just so you know, Dillon, this thing that we've got, I'm not giving up on it. [music playing] ♪ Clang, clang, clang went the trolley ♪ ♪ Ding, ding, ding went the bell ♪ ♪ Zing, zing, zing went my heart strings ♪ ♪ From the moment I saw him I fell ♪ >> Dillon: You guys, that was fantastic. Isn't it so much fun when it all comes together? Now, pretty please, keep practicing your lyrics from home. It's super important because our recital is on Friday. So, remind your parents and invite your family and friends. That's it, guys. Chloe, Owen. You guys, your singing voices are beautiful. Do you think you want to keep doing choir? >> Chloe: Yes, I love it. >> Dillon: You do? >> Owen: It's way better than karate and soccer. >> Dillon: That's awesome. Okay, I will see you guys on Friday. There's your mommy. >> Chelsea: Dillon, that was absolutely incredible. I knew it. You were born for this. >> Dillon: Oh, I don't know about that. >> Chelsea: I do. More kids have been pinballing from activity to activity, just struggling to fit in. Dillon, you've managed to turn that around in one week. >> Dillon: They're just the sweetest kids. I really think they just needed someone to be a little patient with them. >> Chelsea: You know, I could see mentoring kids full-time in this town. Choir in the fall and coding camp in the summer. We'd sure be lucky to have you. >> Dillon: Thanks, Chels. >> Dillon: Hey. So, I wanted to talk to you. >> Jordan: I'm all ears. >> Dillon: Well, I wanted to let you know that Chloe and Owen are doing great in the choir. >> Jordan: That's awesome. >> Dillon: Yeah, they're having a lot of fun. >> Jordan: I'm sure Janelle will be really happy to hear that. >> Dillon: Yeah, I also wanted to talk to you about yesterday. >> Jordan: Yeah, I don't pursue women who are involved with other guys. >> Dillon: That's fair. Shoe's on the other foot now. >> Jordan: Yeah, except for the fact that you were mistaken about me and Janelle, and I'm not mistaken that this Brandon guy thinks he is your boyfriend. >> Dillon: You're right. The truth is Brandon and I haven't been on the best terms for a long time, and to be honest, I haven't thought about him since I got here. >> Jordan: Look, I've been to something like this before, and I'm just not eager to repeat it. >> Dillon: Me neither. That's part of being back home in Silverdale. This is a fresh start for me. >> Jordan: Yeah. Dillon, you're a terrific person, but I think it's probably best that I'm just your hardware salesman. >> Dillon: I understand. But can you still help me fix up Lily? >> Jordan: Lily? >> Dillon: That's my trailer. That's what I decided to name her. >> Jordan: Why lily? >> Dillon: My dad took me camping and we found a whole meadow of lilies. And that's my favorite memory of my childhood before my dad passed away. So, Lily. >> Jordan: That's a good name. Just as friends though, right? >> Dillon: As partners. You help me with my trailer, I will help decorate yours for the festival. Nothing more. >> Jordan: See you tomorrow. [music playing] >> Brandon: Morning. >> Dillon: What? I don't remember calling for ghost buster. >> Brandon: [Chuckles] Wait, what? >> Dillon: What are you doing here? >> Brandon: Apologizing. >> Dillon: Didn't I just ask you for space? >> Brandon: Well, yeah, but that doesn't mean I can't help you finish her new home. >> Brandon: I mean, it kinda does considering that I didn't ask you for help. >> Brandon: I'm just trying to do a good thing here, Dillon. >> Dillon: I appreciate the effort, but I've got all the help I need. >> Brandon: Why? Is your new boyfriend on his way? >> Dillon: Okay, he's not my boyfriend, and the fact that you jump to conclusions makes me not want to explain myself. >> Brandon: Actually, I would love an explanation for what's gotten into you. A few weeks ago, you were this a brilliant coder and you were helping me build this business together, and now I don't even recognize you. >> Dillon: It's actually music to my ears. >> Brandon: Look, I know I neglected you. I put myself and the business first. I skipped dates, I canceled plans. I strung you along. >> Dillon: You gave me an envelope full of cash like I'm that kinda girl. Can't forget that. >> Brandon: Yep, you're right, okay? You deserve better. >> Dillon: Thank you. >> Brandon: I don't want to throw away what we have, Dillon, which is a whole world ahead of us. I know somewhere deep down, you gotta believe that. >> Dillon: Look, all I know at 7:30 in the morning deep down is that I need coffee and, no offense, but someone other than a tech geek to help me with my camper. >> Brandon: Okay. But from one tech geek to another, just take a few days and then see how you feel. >> Dillon: Okay. >> Brandon: But be honest with me. I'm rocking the suit, right? >> Dillon: A little. [music playing] >> Jordan: Last coat, last door. I think this might be some of my best work. >> Dillon: Thank you so much for helping me with this. >> Jordan: My pleasure. >> Dillon: So, what's her name. >> Jordan: Her? Who? >> Dillon: Your trailer. >> Jordan: Oh. >> Dillon: If I'm gonna decorating her, I need to know her name. >> Jordan: Well, it's Chuck. >> Dillon: Chuck? >> Jordan: Yeah. >> Dillon: That's a weird name for a girl. >> Jordan: It was my uncle's. He gave her to me along with the hardware store. >> Dillon: Oh. Well then, I like Chuck. >> Jordan: You know, I think when they're both done, I think Chuck and Lily might take an award-winning couple for the competition. Have you thought about entering Lily into the showcase? >> Dillon: Oh. I don't think she's ready for that. >> Jordan: I respectfully disagree. Look, I mean, the competition is a week away. The judging at the fairgrounds. You've already done the interior and the exterior is gonna be cherry when we're done with it. >> Dillon: Can I ask your question. >> Jordan: Sure. Fire away. >> Dillon: Why'd you move back? >> Jordan: Oh. I think people are just a little nicer here than they are in the city. >> Dillon: Anyone in particular? >> Jordan: Um-- >> Dillon: I'm sorry, that's none of my business. >> Jordan: No, no, no, it's okay. It was Vivian. >> Dillon: From Sweetwater? >> Jordan: Yeah. A few years back, I came back home for the holidays. We met over hot chocolate and we hit it off, so I moved back home, tried to give it a go, and after a few months, let's just say it didn't work out. >> Dillon: Sorry about that. >> Jordan: You know, I was too, but then after a little while, I realized she did me a favor, you know? She gave me a reason to come back to where I belong. >> Dillon: Kind of the same with me and Brandon. >> Jordan: Yeah? Were you two pretty serious? >> Dillon: You could say that. We talked about getting married for a while, but obviously, that didn't happen. >> Jordan: Well, maybe just both dodged bullets. >> Dillon: Yeah. Maybe. Hey, so, are you going to Chloe and Owen's choir performance? >> Jordan: Are you quick kidding. I wouldn't miss it for the world. You know, Janelle tells me that you're the only thing they talk about when they get home. >> Dillon: That's funny because you're the only thing they talk about when they're with me. [music playing] >> With my high starched collar and my high-topped shoes And my hair piled high upon my head I went to lose a jolly hour on the trolley And lost my heart instead With his light brown derby and his bright green tie He was quite the handsomest of men I started to yen so I counted to ten Then I counted to ten again Clang, clang, clang went the trolley Ding, ding, ding went the bell Zing, zing, zing went my heart strings From the moment I saw him I fell Clang, clang, clang went the trolley Ding, ding, ding went the bell Zing, zing, zing went my heart strings From the moment I saw him I fell [Applause] >> Jordan: All right. Three, two, one, cheese. Good job. Dillon, get in here. Come on, we need you in here. >> Dillon: Jump in there with you? >> Jordan: Yeah. Here we go. Three, two, one, cheese. Perfection. >> Chloe: Uncle Jordan, come to the piano lady with us. >> Owen: She has super duper double bubblegum. >> Jordan: My favorite. Let's go. >> Janelle: Thank you so much. I haven't seen them this happy in so long. >> Dillon: Are you kidding me? They're the sweetest kids, really. It was such a pleasure to work with them. >> Janelle: Thanks. So, did I see that you guys rode here together? >> Dillon: You did. Why? >> Janelle: He's my hero, so I don't want to see him get his heart broken again. >> Dillon: He told me all about Vivian. We're just friends, just strictly business. >> Janelle: I'm just not sure he sees it that way. >> Dillon: Trust me. We had a whole conversation about it. >> Janelle: Okay. Well, things can change, so I just-- I'd ask that that you be really careful with his heart because he wears it on his sleeve and it's the best and most vulnerable thing about him, you know? >> Dillon: Oh, I know. >> Vivian: Hi, ladies. >> Janelle: Hi, Vivian. This is the last place I would expect you to be. >> Vivian: Don't be silly, Janelle. You know how much I love patronizing the arts in our little town. >> Janelle: Oh, right. Yes, I forgot how patronizing can be you. >> Vivian: You. [Clears her throat] So, great work with the kids, Ms. Michaels. >> Dillon: Oh, thank you. I'm just the conductor. They're the talent. >> Vivian: Oh, gorgeous and humble. The whole package. >> Dillon: Thank you. >> Vivian: So, I didn't realize that you were so friendly with Jordan. >> Dillon: Oh. No, he's just helping me with my trailer. >> Vivian: Really? How is that little Route 66 Shasta coming along? >> Dillon: She's doing great thanks to the things that you sold me. So, thank you for that. Jordan's actually trying to talk me into doing Trailer Fest. >> Vivian: Is he? Well, excuse my skepticism, but I hardly think that there's enough time to get all of that done in just a week. >> Jordan: Well, good thing that we're working on it 24/7 then. >> Vivian: [Chuckles] Well, you do have a truck to tow it with. I mean, you know that's a required part of the entry. >> Jordan: Yeah. >> Vivian: Okay, all right. You know how to tow a rig? >> Dillon: No, but I'm sure I can learn. >> Vivian: Great. Well, there you have it. [Chuckles] Oh, there is just one more thing. It's just a small matter of eligibility. We are a member's club here, and member reservations were year ago. And last I heard, all the spaces at the event center just, shoot, they're all full. >> Jordan: Oh, you know what? Since I'm the president of the club this year, I get one waiver, right, Vivian? Welcome to the club, Dillon. >> Dillon: Yay me. >> Vivian: Well then. I guess that means that I'll be seeing you both in the Trailer Fest big leagues. [Chuckles] Yay. >> Dillon: Yay. >> Jordan: All right, that's good. Cut it left. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop, stop. Dilly Dilly. >> Dillon: Please do not call me that. >> Jordan: Sorry, my life was flashing before my eyes. >> Dillon: How are we supposed to get Lily into the competition if I can't even park her? >> Jordan: You know what? You're gonna get the hang of it. It just takes a little bit of practice. When you're backing up a trailer, you just have to remember that everything is the opposite of what you expect. >> Dillon: I'm hearing you. My brain is not functioning. >> Margot: Hey, kids. Thought you could use something hot to drink. >> Jordan: Thank you very much, Ms. Michaels. >> Margot: Please, call me Margot. I'm used to it. >> Dillon: Wow, that's actually good. Is this a green tea latte? >> Margot: Not tea. Green hay latte. Straight from this farm to mug. >> Jordan: So, how's your lavender farm going, Ms. Mi-- Margot? >> Margot: Well, I got my drip lines all installed. I'm just waiting for the weather to warm up and I'll get my plants in the ground. I'm practically a farmer. You two going to the dance tonight? >> Jordan: Oh. >> Dillon: What dance? >> Jordan: It's a pre-Trailer Fest dance that they hold at the lodge each year. I'm free tonight. >> Dillon: Oh, I don't know what I would wear. >> Margot: Nonsense. I've been to have more dances than I care to mention. You could wear one of my old dresses. >> Jordan: You could wear one of her old dresses. >> Margot: Just the thing. >> Dillon: What kinda dancing are we talking about here? >> Jordan: All two-step at the shindig. >> Dillon: Well, you know, I'm pretty good at the four-step, so I guess I could just cut it in half and that could probably work. But I should probably get back to this or I'm gonna run out of time. >> Jordan: Oh, I will save my life and get out of your way. Avery: Good news. We could deposit funds in your account by the end of the week. >> Brandon: That is fantastic news, Mr. Avery. I won't let you down. Avery: Great. So, when can you and Dillon Michaels meet to discuss these details? >> Brandon: About that. She's just going through some stuff right now, so I don't know. Avery: Wait, what kind of stuff? Brandon, this deal does not happen without her. >> Brandon: I'm trying to convince her. Avery: Well, try harder. No offense, but we all know she's not only the programming brains behind the operation, but she's also the one who has great marketing instincts. Look, you're good at giving speeches in boardrooms, I'll give you that, but I have a sneaking suspicion you couldn't code your way out of a paper bag. Quit laughing, Brandon. No Dillon, no deal, all right? >> Brandon: Understood. It's not a problem. Avery: All right. Call me when you're both back in town. We could do a meet-up. Only after that will I wire the money. >> Brandon: Absolutely. >> Alexander: It grows in almost any climate. >> Margot: Like I said-- >> Alexander: Well, look at you. >> Margot: You look like a dream, Dilly. >> Dillon: Are you sure? >> Alexander: Trust me, that Jordan's gonna be speechless. >> Jordan: Good thing we took your 4 x 4. My truck would've been toast in this crazy Colorado weather. >> Dillon: There wasn't even a cloud in the sky this morning. Thanks for driving. >> Jordan: You look nice, by the way. >> Dillon: Thank you. So do you. >> Jordan: Are you okay? >> Dillon: Yeah. Kind of. I can't dance. My feet don't work. >> Jordan: [Chuckles] How bad? >> Dillon: Like we probably shouldn't go to the dance bad. >> Jordan: Okay. What would you rather do? [Laughter] >> Dillon: No, no, no. [Screams] >> Jordan: Hey, that's my side. This is my angel. >> Dillon: I haven't done that since I was like 10. Margot had a mean fastball. >> Jordan: Oh really? >> Dillon: Yeah. Thank you for this. >> Jordan: Yeah. Hey, do you mind if I ask you a personal question? >> Dillon: Depends what it is. >> Jordan: What's the deal with you and your mom? >> Dillon: Oh. Um, the deal is that she left to go find herself when I was younger, so I was kinda raised by my grandparents. >> Jordan: Wow. I'm really sorry that happened to you. That must've been really hard. I hope that at some point, she gives you a reason to believe that she deserves a second chance. >> Dillon: Oh, she's trying. She's trying. But it just gets a point where how many second chances can you give someone, you know? >> Jordan: Heck, I've been given third, fourth, fifth chances and still, I don't get it right all the time, but the important thing is that you keep trying. It seems like she's trying. I'm sorry. I just overstepped my bounds. >> Dillon: No, no. You didn't. I was actually just thinking that I don't think I've ever met anyone that thinks about people that way. [music playing] >> Dillon: Margot, what's wrong? >> Margot: Dilly. Did you have fun at the dance? >> Dillon: We did end up making it. The snow got us. What's the matter? >> Margot: It's nothing. >> Dillon: Is that-- I thought I recognized it. >> Margot: It's the same I wore on my first date with your daddy. I thought It'd be nice to share it with you for your first date with Jordan. But seeing you in it-- I didn't know it would hit me like this. I just never got over losing him. >> Dillon: I know. I didn't either. Maybe it's not too late. >> Margot: For what? >> Dillon: A do-over. Grandma always taught me that God has a life for us after our losses. I think I'm starting to see that now. >> Margot: You mean with Jordan? >> Dillon: Yeah, I think so. Even just being back home, I just feel more at peace than I ever have. Not something that I ever could've ever had being on that emotional roller coaster that I was on in Portland. Chasing a dream that maybe was never real to begin with. Maybe that's the same for you too. >> Margot: I've been a terrible mother. >> Dillon: Don't say that. >> Margot: I take it back. I haven't even been that. To be terrible, you have to be present. I'm so sorry, Dilly. I am so, so sorry. >> Dillon: I'm sorry too. >> Margot: For what? >> Dillon: For writing you off. I'm so sorry I never stopped to think about what you are going through or to put myself in your shoes. >> Margot: You shouldn't have had to. You were a little girl. You needed me. >> Dillon: I know, but you're here now, and that's what matters. >> Margot: I love you, Dilly. >> Dillon: I love you too. Mom. >> Margot: I love the sound of that. >> Dillon: I love getting to say it. >> Margot: Do you think that you and your mama could have one of those do-overs you're talking about? >> Dillon: On one condition. You have to let me make grandpa corndogs. >> Margot: Not a chance, Dillon Michaels. >> Jordan: That was great. One more time. Pull it forward. >> Dillon: What did I do? >> Jordan: Looks like we broke the axle on the trailer. I didn't check it for rust. There might've been a weak seam between the bearings and the holding somewhere. >> Dillon: That doesn't sound good. >> Jordan: It's not great. We don't fix that axle, it's not moving from this spot and you're definitely not gonna be able to haul it to the festival. I might have a solution actually. It'll be tight, but I think I could get it done. >> Dillon: But the festival's tomorrow and I still have to decorate your trailer. >> Jordan: Don't worry about that. I'll just enter it the way it is. [music playing] >> Jordan: Wow. You did it. Look at you. >> Dillon: I did and my parking job didn't send anyone to the ER. >> Jordan: Good. You know, I think Lily might be the belle of the ball tonight. >> Dillon: Thanks to you. This place is amazing. >> Jordan: Oh yeah. Silverdale knows how to get its party on. >> Dillon: Where's Chuck? >> Jordan: Oh, he is right where he needs to be. >> Vivian: Well, I see you actually pulled a rabbit out of your hat. >> Dillon: Barely. He had to stay up all night fixing my axle. >> Vivian: Well, isn't that sweet of him. >> Dillon: What do you think? >> Vivian: Good luck with this year's judges, Dave and Nancy McCullough. They are notoriously finicky. >> Jordan: Don't worry about her. She's just used to winning every year. Actually, for the first time in a long time, I think I saw fear in her eyes. So, Lily intimidates her. Hey. So, I need to get going, actually. As the president this year, I need to let the judges know they're green-lit to start their rounds. >> Margot: She is beautiful, Dilly. I'm so proud of you. I got you a little something to finish up your entry. >> Dillon: Lilies. >> Margot: Your favorite. I remember your camping story with your daddy. >> Dillon: Hi, guys. Thank you for coming. >> Janelle: We wouldn't have missed it. >> Dillon: Do you guys want to help me finish setting up my trailer? >> Both: Yes! >> Janelle: Go on in. Wow. >> Nancy: Hello, Silverdale Camper Club, and welcome to this season's trailer Oktoberfest. >> Dillon: Before we crown this year's winners, our very own Bear Bailey's gonna grace us with his latest ballad. [Applause] [music playing] >> Jordan: Dave, Nancy. What do you think? >> Dave: Interesting Route 66 motif. Shasta wings look original. >> Nancy: The white with red accents are transcendent. >> Dave: Transcendent. We are critics in the arena assessing design, not poetry. It's like tabula Rossa, a clean slate in which the red makes a bold splash. >> Dillon: Yes, bold splash. That is what I was going for. That was short and hopefully sweet. >> Jordan: They know what they like. >> Dillon: They take it seriously. >> Jordan: Oh yeah, as a heart attack. Town pride in Western civilization is on the line for the winner. >> Dillon: Well, I wouldn't be here without you, so if for some reason I happen to win, I'll share my winnings with you. >> Jordan: There is no money involved, but I will split the bragging rights with you fifty-fifty. You look like a happy camper. >> Dillon: I am thanks to you. >> Nancy: Now, the judging has been completed and the results are in. >> Dave: Which is to say that Nancy and I huddled down in our trailer over a bowl of chili and bickered for an hour. >> Nancy: As you know, we give out three awards each year. The first award for most creative theme goes to Bob and Tina Madsen and their daughter Laney for their steampunk and their celebration of the magical and fantastical. [Applause] >> Dave: Next, most patriotic theme. For their 200 Stars & Stripes flags and the national anthem playing over the loudspeaker. Randy and Dawn Richardson. [Applause] >> Nancy: And last but not least, the grand prize for best overall theme goes to... perennial favorite and multiyear champion, Everything Pink, Vivian Porter. [Applause] But wait, folks. There's a wrinkle this year. >> Dave: That's right. For the first time in 17 seasons of vintage trailer Oktoberfest, we have a tie for best overall rig. So, please give a warm round of applause for our newest member, Dillon Michaels. [Applause] >> Vivian: I was not expecting this. Once again, Silverdale, just thank you so much. [Applause] Thank you so much. >> Dillon: I just want to say I love your community and I love being part of it. So, thank you. [Applause] >> Dave: The big one's in the mail. >> Nancy: Congratulations to all our winners. There were some amazing entries this year. There are no losers in Oktoberfest. >> Dave: That's right. Our competition may be over, but the good times are just beginning. >> Brandon: Hey. Hi, Excuse me, everybody. Hi, sorry. Before we continue to celebrate this amazing event, can I have your attention, please? >> Dillon: What are you doing here? >> Brandon: Hi, everybody. I'm Brandon Kranz and I just was a few words to someone who is very special to me. For the last three years, you've been the light of my life. You're my best friend, my partner, and I've realized that I can't do life without you. And I'm ready to spend the rest of it with you. Dillon Michaels, will you marry me? >> Crowd: Aww. >> Brandon: Stop. >> Dillon: You are unbelievable. >> Brandon: What? >> Dillon: What is wrong with you? >> Brandon: I thought this is what you wanted. >> Dillon: How? >> Brandon: You always talked about getting married and I was always too busy, but then I get it now. I was missing out on the greatest thing in my life. I made mistakes, I know, but I want this more than anything, Dillon. Do you think that you can forgive me and say yes all at once? >> Dillon: No. And please take that hat off. No, I am not marrying you. >> Brandon: Okay, fine. Then just come to Portland for a few days. That's it. And then if you're not happy, you can come back here and settle down with Jeremiah. >> Dillon: It's Jordan. >> Brandon: Got it, Jordan. But I think you're gonna notice all this is not who you are. >> Dillon: And who am I, Brandon? >> Brandon: You're the woman I fell in love with. You're driven, you're ambitious, you're the best coder on God's green earth, Dillon, and I want to spend the rest of my life with you. >> Dillon: That's not who I am anymore. >> Brandon: Of course it is. >> Dillon: No, it's not. >> Brandon: Yes, you've just been bamboozled by this place. >> Dillon: Bamboozled? Really? >> Brandon: Okay, I get it. Silverdale is quaint, it's charming, but it's stuck in a time warp, Dillon. The future and the world is moving beyond towns like this. You'll get past this phase when you leave. Just come home with me. >> Dillon: I am home, Brandon. That's what I've been trying to tell you. Silverdale is home. This is where I feel at home. >> Brandon: Okay, fine, but then what about the business, our dream? >> Dillon: What about it? >> Brandon: This is our chance to change the world. Dillon, what we're doing together with this app is embracing the future, something that this town is not doing. Changing the way that people connect with your ideas and your coding, and we can do this together as a team and so much more. >> Dillon: No. You're gonna have to do it without me. This isn't my dream anymore, Brandon. >> Brandon: I pitched your idea to our new investor, Mr. Avery. The user function that allows a member to make a donation to the favorite charity of the man or woman they're trying to woo. Avery loved it. >> Dillon: He did? >> Brandon: Yeah. And we can make dating app history with this new vision, Dillon. >> Dillon: No. No, you can have my idea. >> Brandon: Dillon, please, okay? I need you, all right? >> Dillon: You don't need me. >> Brandon: Yes I do, because Avery won't fund us without you. >> Dillon: I knew it. I knew it. That ring. It's still about the business. It's always about the business with you. Thank you so much. You know what? Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you for finally telling me the truth. I wish you nothing but the best, but you have to do it without me. >> Pretty cute, huh? >> Janelle: Dillon, is everything okay? >> Chloe: Are you going to marry that guy now? >> Owen: His cowboy hat is too big. >> Dillon: No, guys. Not now, not ever. >> Owen: Good, you can marry Uncle Jordan. >> Dillon: Speaking about Jordan, have you seen him? >> Janelle: I saw him pass a few minutes ago, but I don't know he went. Sorry. >> Owen: We saw Uncle Jordan right there passed the food truck. [music playing] >> Vivian: You know you shouldn't have trusted your heart with her. >> Jordan: Yep. Well, I guess you know all about that, wouldn't you, Vivian? >> Vivian: Look. These city girls, they come here, they feel all sentimental about country life for like a minute, but then they realized how much they miss the big city lights, and their careers, and men that they are actually in love with. >> Jordan: You know what? I gotta go. Congratulations on your win, Vivian. >> Vivian: Jordan, wait. Listen. I know. I know that you probably don't trust me either after everything that's happened with us, and I get that, but I want you to know that I'm here for you if you need me. I really mean that. I mean it. >> Jordan: Vivian, there is no us. [Chuckles] >> Margot: Dilly, are you okay? >> Alexander: Well, at least you got rid of dating app guy. >> Margot: You gonna talk to Jordan? >> Dillon: He does not want to talk to me right now. >> Margot: How do you know that? >> Dillon: Because I saw him getting all cuddly with Vivian Porter at the festival. >> Alexander: I wouldn't read too much into that, Dilly. That gal definitely kicked Jordan to the curb a long time ago. >> Margot: Grandpa's right, that doesn't make sense. Jordan really cares about you. >> Dillon: Why? Because he helped me paint my trailer? >> Margot: He did a lot more than that, Dilly. He promised us to secrecy. >> Dillon: What do you mean? >> Alexander: Well, you know how he worked to fix your axle all night? >> Dillon: Yeah. >> Alexander: You know how we did it? >> Dillon: I'm not Pep Boys. >> Alexander: He disassembled his trailer, pulled his own axle, and put it on yours. >> Dillon: He took himself out of the competition so I wouldn't have to? >> Margot: Mm-Hm. >> Dillon: Great, so I lost the best guy I know. [music playing] >> Dillon: Jordan? >> Jordan: Hey. >> Dillon: What are you doing up here? >> Jordan: Where's your grandpa? He told me to meet him here. [music playing] >> Alexander: Hey, kids. >> Margot: The floor is all yours. >> Dillon: I think we've been set up. >> Jordan: I think you might be right. So, how is Brandon? >> Dillon: Um, he is probably halfway back to Portland, trying to sell my engagement ring for funding. >> Jordan: Oh. So, you're done with him? >> Dillon: A hundred percent. >> Jordan: What about your job? What about WooWoo? What about Portland? >> Dillon: I don't know about WooWoo, but the beauty of Wi-Fi is that I can work from anywhere. So, this is home again. >> Jordan: I like hearing that. >> Dillon: So, how's Vivian? >> Jordan: Vivian? Oh. Did you see her try to come onto me at the food truck? >> Dillon: Yeah. >> Jordan: At this point, I hope that you know her well enough to know that that was all her and not me. She still thinks she has mineral rights to me or something ever since we broke up. >> Dillon: I mean, I was praying that was the case. My mom-- Yeah, I'm calling her that now, thanks to you. She and my grandpa told me what you did with your axle. >> Jordan: Oh. >> Dillon: You did not have to do that. >> Jordan: That's what you do for someone when you care about them. Care to dance? [music playing] >> Jordan: I have a confession to make. >> Dillon: Oh boy. >> Jordan: There is a woman. And I haven't seen her since we were kids, and she just moved back to town. She's kind of turned my world upside down and I'm really trying to find a way to tell her that I'm falling in love with her. [music playing] >> Dillon: I love you too, Jordan. [music playing]
