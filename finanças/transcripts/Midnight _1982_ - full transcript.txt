[Girl screams] [screams continue] [moaning] [Woman] Hurry up! I think her heel's caught in a trap! [screams continue] [Mama] Hon, don't be afraid. I'm right behind you. I said the prayers that helped catch it. Look's like Jimmy Peterson's sister. But it ain't. It's a demon, ain't it, Mama? [Mama] They can look like anything they want. Hit it, Luke. [Girl] Is it a demon for sure? [Mama] Yes! Hit it! [Mama] Hit it! You did real good. Now let's drag it back to the house and give it the last rites. Why did it look like Jimmy Peterson's sister? [Mama] I told you they could take any form they wanted to. A rabbit, a possum, even a human being. It's up to us not to be taken in. If they're sent to us, we've got to destroy them! Otherwise, this family can fall under a spell. [ticking sound] [ticking continues] All right, Cynthia. It's midnight. Time to begin. Do it the way I taught you. Oh, mighty lord Satan, we ask thee to help us in the destruction of our enemies, as you have done for us today. We pledge ourselves to thee and may we continue to be thy faithful servants. Whomsoever you send to us we shall destroy, knowing it is thy will. Amen. Now, Cynthia! Now! [Woman's voice, distorted] Oh, mighty lord Satan... [Woman continues indistinctly] [watch ticking] Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been two years since my last good confession. [Father] You say it's been two years since your last good confession? Yes, Father. Let me get this straight. Do you mean to tell me that during the past two years you haven't been to confession, or do you mean you made bad confessions during this time? I meant bad confessions, Father. Ten of them. How do you mean they were bad? Did you fail to tell some sin you were guilty of? Yes, Father. Why in the world did you do that? I don't know, Father. I was afraid. What sin were you afraid to tell? Having carnal relations with my boyfriend, Father. I see. Is he a Catholic? He was, Father. But we broke up. It was undoubtedly the best thing that could have happened. You were living in sin with him, do you realize that? Yes, Father. You have committed the grievous sin of sacrilege by making false confessions. This is one of the most awful sins a Catholic can commit. Do you realize you can burn in hell forever for this one sin? Do you understand that, for two years, the power of sanctifying grace was absent from your soul? If you had died at any time during those two years, you would, right at this instant, be burning in hell. Your immortal soul would have descended directly into the arms of Satan. I know, Father. And I am sorry. You had better be sorry. Now make a good Act of Contrition. "Oh, my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended thee and I renounce all my sins because I dread the loss of heaven and the pains of hell. But most of all, I renounce them because they offend thee, my God, who are all good and deserving of all my love. I firmly resolve, with the help of thy grace, to confess my sins, to do penance and to amend my life. Amen. [Man over radio] You're tuned to Ken Perry, afternoon show, FM radio. He did? Oh, Patty, I'm so happy for you. I knew Bob would get up the nerve to ask you out. Well, I saw the way he kept staring at you in homeroom. He's so shy. I bet the two of you will hit it right off. I'm waiting for my stepfather to get home so I can have the car. He's working nightshift, but he said I could have the car to go to the mall. Oh, he'll let me have it, all right, if he doesn't wreck it on the way home. He's been drinking like a fish again, driving my mother crazy. Mm-hmm. [doorbell rings] Oh, hang on a minute, Patty. I think I hear my stepfather at the door. Okay? Mm-hmm. [knocking] [knocking continues] [sighs] Hello, Daddy. Good morning, sweetheart. How about a big kiss for me, huh? Daddy! Hey, you don't have to call me Daddy all the time. I'm just your stepfather. We both know that. Nothing wrong with a little smooch now and then. Hey, where's your mother? She went to get her hair done, remember? Wait. You said I could have the car to go shopping. Can I? [chuckles] Sure. Sure you can have the car. Now how about a big hug and kiss for me, huh? Daddy, you're hurting me! Please, let me go! My girlfriend Patty's on the phone. She's waiting for me to get back on the line. I told her you were at the door. [sighs] [dial tone beeping] Hello, Patty. I'm back. Patty, are you there? Darn it! Why did she have to hang up? [sighs] Nancy. Hey, come on now, baby. What's the matter with you? We're all alone. Nobody home but us. Why don't you loosen up a little bit? Show you a little of that loving you don't get from your mother. Daddy, leave me alone. Come on, baby. Hey, listen, I need to see what you look like without your clothes on. I won't lay a hand on you, I promise you. We don't have to go any further than just looking. Unless you change your mind and you wanna... Are you out of your mind? You're drunk. You don't know what you're saying. You're my stepfather! Get out of my room or I'm going to tell my mother when she comes home! I know you have to put up a show of resistance. But you don't fool me. I know you're no virgin. I heard you one night on the back porch with your boyfriend. One thing for sure-- you're not as frigid as your mother! Now get out of my room. Now how you gonna act, huh? Daddy, stop it. Why don't you just relax and let Daddy make you feel good? Daddy, please! Ain't that good, honey? Huh? [groans] [snoring] How far you going, honey? California. That's quite a long trip. What would you do for me if I take you as far as 600 miles of it? What do you mean? Don't play coy with me, young stuff. I'll make it simple for you. Three hundred miles, then we share a motel room. Tomorrow, another 300 miles, another motel room. And we kiss each other good-bye in the morning with no hard feelings. That way, your conscience is clear, you've paid your way. Hey, Hank, I wouldn't mind picking her up. We're just a couple minutes too late though, huh? Yeah, good thing, too. Obviously she's jailbait. You think so? I wonder where she's headed. Dream on. You're never going to find out. She's gonna jump into that cat's car and be long gone. I'm only going as far as Detroit. You headed for L.A. or Frisco? Hey, that girl's still back there. Looks like her and that guy are having some kind of an argument or something. Look, I'm telling you one more time, mister, you get out of here or I'm gonna call the cops. As a matter of fact, my stepfather is on the police force. You smart young slut. Hey, that guy didn't pick her up. I'm gonna go get her. [Hank] For Christ sake, forget it, Tom. They'll be plenty of chicks in Lauderdale. We're liable to get her in here with us and then she'll tear her blouse and threaten to yell "rape" to the nearest cop. And then we'd give up all the money we got in our pockets. She wouldn't get much. She's probably just a nice young girl who needs a lift. All right, white boy. Most of the time, if a good-looker like that has to go begging for something it means she's in some kind of trouble. [Hank] Either that, or she is trouble. Why do you wanna mess up a good vacation? [Tom] If we don't pick her up, she's liable to be picked up by some creep. I'm going back for her. [Hank] All right. You're the driver. But I sure hope you ain't doin' something dumb. Cool it, Hank. Hi. Need a lift? Didn't you just go around the block before? Yeah, I was gonna pick you up the first time. But I figure you had your problem solved. Oh! I'd have my problems solved for good. All I had to do was let that man take me to a motel room. Is that what you're after too? I told you! The chick's nothing but trouble. Shut up. We can all reach an understanding. Me and Hank-- we're not creeps. We give you a ride, you don't owe us anything. I just don't want you to get picked up by some lunatic. We're headed to Lauderdale. I wanted to go to my sister's place in California. Kids'll be going back to college to finish out the term. A good many of them make the Lauderdale scene from schools in the Midwest and so on. You'd be able to check out a ride on a personal level, make sure it's somebody safe. Well-- Come on! [Woman] ¶ You're on your own You're all alone ¶ ¶ You can't go home anymore ¶ [no audible dialogue] ¶ You're on your own ¶ ¶ You're all alone And midnight's at your door ¶ ¶ Ever more ¶ Ever more ¶ You're on your own ¶ ¶ You're all alone ¶ ¶ You're on your own ¶ ¶ You're all alone ¶ ¶ You're on your own ¶ ¶ You're all alone ¶ Hi, honey. Burt, what happened to your forehead? Oh, I-- I got a little bruise locking up a drunk. Where's Nancy? I had the impression that she wanted to take your car to the mall today. Far as I'm concerned, she did go to the mall. She wasn't here when I got home. One of her girlfriends must have picked her up early. Honey, you got a cup of coffee for me? Sure, dear. Go sit down. I'll bring it in to you. She probably went with Patty. She's not dating anyone new, is she? How would I know? I can't keep track of that wild crowd she hangs around with. I don't think they're particularly wild. They're a lot nicer than most teenagers are these days. Hmm. That's what you think. Now what's that supposed to mean? Don't worry. They know what it's all about. I could tell you a few things. Well, tell me. If it's something I ought to know. It's just that Nancy's not everything you think she is. I think you better explain yourself. Well, I've been debating for some time now whether I should say anything but I guess it's best that you know. She pretends to be so sweet and innocent when you're around. But it's just an act. She was flaunting her little body at me. What do you mean? Well, you know. Rubbing up against me whenever she gets an excuse. God knows I've tried to avoid her. I'll be darned if I know what her game is. Sometimes I think she's trying to break you and me up. Burt, are you saying that Nancy tried to seduce you? Oh, I don't think she'd ever wanna go that far. But...well, let's say she's trying to test her sex appeal in a juvenile way. Mind you, I have no doubt she's still a virgin. Well, I happen to know that she's not. She was pretty brokenhearted when her boyfriend dumped her. And I heard a conversation that made it pretty clear that they had been sleeping together. Well, Nancy won't confide in me. I-I just have to find out everything accidentally. You know what I think, honey? I think she just resents the fact that I'm not her real father. That's why I've been hitting the bottle again lately. Till now, I haven't been able to bring myself to tell you how she's been acting. Such a terrible thing to have to face up to. So I've been carrying it on my shoulders, to shield you from it. Burt, you and I haven't been very close lately. Could it be because of what you've been going through with Nancy? But of course, honey. What do you think? I love you and I don't wanna lose you. And I've been afraid Nancy'd come to you with some wild story about me. That's why I wanted you to hear my side of it first, so nothing could ever come between us. I-I know we have to give Nancy love and understanding, but the important thing is, darling, for you and me to stick together. Terry's already gone off to California, and I suppose, before long, Nancy'll go off on her own too. We won't have anybody but each other to lean on in our old age, dear. ¶ [rock] ¶ You're on your own ¶ ¶ You're all alone You can't go home anymore ¶ ¶ You're on your own ¶ ¶ You're all alone ¶ ¶ And midnight's at your door ¶ ¶ Ever more ¶ Ever more ¶ You're on your own ¶ ¶ You're all alone ¶ ¶ You're on your own ¶ ¶ You're all alone ¶ ¶ You're on your own ¶ ¶ You're all alone ¶ Hi. Wanna fill it up? Okay. You have a men's room? It's around there. It's unlocked. You want a potato chip, Hank? No. You sure? I don't want any. You know, uh, when we get to Lauderdale, I hope you aren't figuring on hanging around with Tom and me, making a pest of yourself. Don't worry. I can make my own friends. I think you better have a little talk with Tom. I don't think he feels the same way about me as you do. I don't have anything against you. It's nothing personal, but this trip was supposed to be mine and Tom's. Yeah. [door slams] Pardon me, young man. Is that your van? No, it's not mine. It's my friend's. I'm Reverend Carrington, pastor of the First Baptist Church. This is my daughter, Sandra, home from college for the holiday. The bus from Perryville let us off at the crossroad. It's still a long way home if we walk it-- ten miles. What are you majoring in, Sandra? Education. Gonna be a teacher, huh? I hope so. You seem to be headed in our direction. Do you mind if we ride with you a short piece? Believe me, I hate to be so forward. You two fellas are strangers and don't owe us anything. Truth is, I don't mind walking 10 miles. But I'm scared to be out all alone on those back roads with my daughter. It's too dangerous. There's been a half a dozen people found dead around here just in the past couple of years since I came here to preach. Some look like accidents, some, obviously murdered. A man and wife in my own congregation was found burnt to death in their cottage. The sheriff ruled accident, but that don't explain why a half-empty can of gasoline was found back in the woods. Some of the lawmen around here don't feel too particularly about anybody who isn't white. Watch your mouth, preacher. That'll be $20. Your tank was bone dry. Real friendly guy, ain't he? [door slams] Will you let us ride with you? Sure, it's no problem. Maybe you can point out a good place to make camp. Lord have mercy if you decide to camp out around here. Didn't you hear me say some people have been murdered? Why don't you let me put you up at our place? We're much obliged, sir, but we'd rather camp out under the stars. It was very nice of those young people to give us a ride. I hope they listen to what you told them and don't go camping out around here. Why don't we go to the house first, rest, get something to eat, and then you can visit the grave later. No, I'd rather do it now. And it won't hurt for you to come along. When was the last time you prayed for your mother's immortal soul? I pray for her every night, Daddy. And nothin' in the Bible says I have to do it beside her tombstone. Watch your mouth, girl. While you live under my roof you'll treat my beliefs with respect. And you'll respect your mother's blessed memory. I finished my prayer, Daddy. I'm going to the house and make some tea and sandwiches. I'll take the suitcase. [gasps, shouts] [grunts] [maniacal laughter] [Men chattering] Hi, can I have a six-pack of Pabst, please? You a stranger? [all] What you doin' in here? [Men continue shouting] Hey, Annie. We don't serve any people like that. It's all right for you. Take your boy along with you. I'm looking on you, black boy. [chattering continues] Hey, you two! You two! You. You. Get over here. Now! Now, move it. [Men chattering] Which one of you owns this van? I do. Okay. Take your six-pack, get in the van, get out of town. Now! You heard the man. Come on, let's go! Let's go! We don't need your kind around here. Hank, move it. [all chattering] Let's go! [car starting] We don't need you. [tires squealing] We told them off. [Tom] I thought they were gonna smack us. We're lucky we got out of there in one piece. [Nancy] I can't believe it. Why were they picking on us? Those loudmouth honkies. Find a grocery store, Tom. Let's teach these hicks a lesson. No, Hank, we better be careful. This isn't the place to try anything foolish. You're chicken! I can't believe you let those creeps scare you! Try what? Well, I might as well tell you, as long as you're going to be riding with us. Me and Hank, we ain't exactly rich. So, before we left school, we figured out a careful budget. We decided that... if we pay for gas, then we wouldn't have enough money for food. And if we paid for food, we wouldn't have enough money for gas. So, we been... stealing groceries all the way from Pennsylvania to Florida. That's how we been making it. Listen. If you don't want to stay with us now that you know, we'll let you out and you can hitch another ride. After you talked me into going to Florida instead of California. [Hank] How much bread you got on you, girl? $14. Certainly not enough to feed yourself all the way to Frisco. Then you have to steal. And if you have to, then it's not a sin. [sighs] [dog barking] [teapot squealing] [banging] Daddy, is that you? [rapid knocking] [knocking continues] [gasps, screams] [laughing] [screaming] [laughing continues] [screaming] [laughing] Help! Here's a nice grocery store just made to order. You could help us pull this off. Mm-mm. You don't have to if you don't want to. But if you stick with us without doing your share you gonna be eating stolen food anyway. ¶ [soft rock] ¶ [Woman singing indistinctly] ¶ All the people surrounding you ¶ ¶ Don't want to be your friend ¶ ¶ All the hope keeping you ¶ ¶ Has finally reached an end ¶ ¶ And it's coming 'round to midnight ¶ ¶ You're all alone and it's midnight ¶ ¶ You're on your own You're all alone ¶ ¶ You can't go home anymore ¶ ¶ You're on your own You're all alone ¶ ¶ And midnight's at your door ¶ ¶ Ever more ¶ You fought the rulers and lost your sense ¶ ¶ And broke up with my friends ¶ ¶ You're finally looking to your past ¶ ¶ To find the way again ¶ The days to come will see you through ¶ ¶ And tell you in the end ¶ 'Cause it's coming round to midnight ¶ Go! [yelling] Come on! [tires squeal] [Man over police radio] Three teenagers with stolen groceries last seen in a blue and white van heading toward... [tires squealing] [Police officer] Get on 'em! [siren wailing] [Tom] Uh-oh! It's the cops! [Nancy] Tom, hurry up! Hit the gas. Faster, Tom. I got it to the floor now. It won't go any faster. [Tom] Take it easy. Look out, punk! That's the way. They're dropping behind. [Hank] Here we go. Here we go. [siren fading] How far back are they? I can't see 'em, Tom. Turn off. [tires squealing] [siren wailing] [Tom] She's down to the floor. I'm pulling in here! [Hank] I don't hear the siren anymore. [Nancy] Hank, did we lose 'em? I think we lost 'em! [Tom] Could be. [Hank] Damn right we did. You did it, Tom. [all laughing] Wow! What a rush! [all chattering] [Nancy] Look out! I almost hit that guy. He was carrying something. Did you see that? It's lucky I saw anything at all. Thanks for telling me. There's something creepy about that guy. I got a look at his face. He was grinning, even when you were going to hit him, Tom. I swear, he had this strange look on his face. I thought I saw a shoe sticking out from under that blanket. Nah, he was just a big farmer with a bundle. Your mind's playing tricks on you. You're all shook up. Soon as we find a good camp site we'll smoke some of this good hash and loosen you up. [sinister chuckle] ¶ If religion was a thing ¶ That money could buy ¶ The rich would live ¶ And the poor ¶ Would die ¶ ¶ All ¶ ¶ My trials, Lord ¶ Soon ¶ Be over Nancy, you sing nice. Thank you. Doesn't she sing nice, Hank? I don't think she got much right to be singing a slave song. Come on. Don't start getting paranoid on us. Who's paranoid? Not me. I just said I don't think a white girl ought to be singing a slave song, that's all. Black people paid their dues in that area, not whites. White chicks like Nancy can't have the least idea of the feeling behind a black spiritual. That's bull, Hank. What's wrong with you? You don't like me, do you, Hank? It dawned on me that you gotta be running away from home. And if so, me and poor innocent Tom are accessories. How old are you? 19. Well, 17. Almost 18! You sure you ain't 16 or 15? Leave her alone! Shut up, white boy! One of us has gotta have the sense to find out how much hot water we may be in! You ever hear of the Mann Act? I can't believe you! Transporting a minor across state lines? You better think about it, Tom. We could have the FBI on our ass. You're crazy. We both know you flunked out of law school. Now come off it! Don't mind him. He gets a little bit mean when he gets stoned. He'll be okay in a while. If you're uptight about me, you don't need to keep me around. I don't wanna be a burden on you. We can go our separate ways in the morning. He doesn't mean anything, Nancy. [rustling] Damn it, tell her you don't mean it! Now you've hurt her feelings. I do mean it! We hardly know that chick! I warned you she'd be trouble. You're the one who's trouble. I wish you'd learn to keep your mouth shut! Tomorrow morning you won't even know what a hassle you've caused! Nancy! Hey, you might tell somebody if you've got a problem. What makes you think I have one? Okay, so if you don't have one, we won't talk about it. Listen, I just wanna tell you that Hank's really not a bad guy. He'll let you stay, you'll see. Everything will be okay in the morning. [heavy breathing] [Nancy] I had a bad experience with my stepfather. My mother doesn't know what he's like. She wouldn't believe me if I told her. The only person I have to run to is my sister in California. I'm sorry. You should have told somebody. I don't wanna be a burden. And I'd really rather not come between you and your friend. You'll be better off without me. That's not true at all. You've been helpful and fun to be with. Hey, I want you to stay, Nancy. [Man chuckling] Hank? Is that you? [laughs] Hank? Hank, is that you? [snorts] Hank! Hank, is that you? I-It's probably some kind of an animal. A hyena, maybe. If they've got 'em around here. Come on, Nancy. Let's go back and turn in. Bert. I have a feeling something happened between you and my daughter. I think you're lying to me about this and I wanna know why. Why didn't Nancy come home? Damn it, Harriet. How the hell should I know? I told you that kid's not as innocent as you make her out to be. She's probably somewhere carrying on. It isn't like Nancy to stay out this late without phoning. I'm worried about this, Bert. And I think you know something you're not telling me. Will you stop imagining things! I've got to get down to the station house. As soon as I do get down there, I'll check the police blotter, if it'll make you feel better. And if anything has happened to Nancy the police know about, I'll get all the facts. One way or another I'll call you in a couple of hours. Now, calm down. By the time I do call you, she'll probably be home in bed, safe and sound. Hold it there , fellas! Don't you make any foolish moves! Keep your hands visible! You reach for anything inside that bag and I won't wait to see what you're reaching for. I'll just shoot. What's this all about? Shut up. [2nd Officer] Where's the girl? You killed her, didn't you? [groans] You sadistic scum! Don't make a move. Or I'll blow your brains to bloody pieces. Maybe they think they can pin us with a police brutality rap. Make a civil rights case out of it. Filthy scum. You don't deserve humane treatment. What'd you do with the girl? Where'd you hide her body? Maybe we oughta drag 'em out in the woods, one at a time. Question 'em separately. Good idea. Who's first? Eenie... meenie... miney... Wait, can't we talk about this? We didn't kill anybody! All we're guilty of is stealing a few bags of groceries. [2nd Officer] Oh, a confession? Trying to get off lightly by admitting to a lesser offense! Well, it won't work! We've seen that ploy before. I am tired of playing games with you two. We know you're guilty. Your van was spotted near the place where that girl was found, raped, stabbed. Can't lie out of it. You're gonna have to pay. And we don't care if we take you in alive or dead. Dead would be preferable. [Hank] We're entitled to a trial. We're innocent. Get your ass up out of that sleeping bag, pronto! Who do you think we should question first, partner? No, I remember now. We saw a big heavy man in farm overalls. I almost ran him down. He was in the middle of the road. [laughs] He was carrying this big, heavy bundle. It might have been a body. It must have been a body! Listen, is he the one who turned us in? If so, he's obviously trying to frame us, huh? [laughing] Look, my brother's a lawyer back in Pittsburgh-- They don't wanna hear it, man. Get out of those sleeping bags! On the double! I am tired of playing games with you two. We know you're guilty. You can't lie out of it. Run, Hank! [gunshots] [gasps] [groans] [Tom] Get away! Go! [gunshot] [groans] [gunshot] You killed him! You stupid redneck! We're innocent! We told him he could get his head blowed off. Serves him right. You must be crazy. Crazy! Your buddy was resisting arrest. Are you ready to confess to killing that girl now? You see, I knew her and her parents real well, and I'd do anything to bring in her killers. You have to understand that the people in this county would turn a blind eye to any irregularities, as long as they felt they got justice. Go ahead and shoot me. That's what you're gonna do anyways, isn't it? Well, we already know you're guilty. The actual confession is merely a formality. The fact that your partner tried to run don't make you look very innocent. But it saves the taxpayers money. Step aside. Give me a clear shot. [gunshot] [screams] [gunshot] [sighs] [maniacal laughter] [laughing continues] [panting] [pounding on door] [panting] Look, I'm in trouble. Can you help me? Do you have a telephone? [maniacal laughter] [screams] [shouts] [screams] Please, let me go! You killed both my friends. The real murderer's in there! Well, let's go see. We got to investigate, see if this young lady's telling the truth. I don't wanna go back in there! She's stark raving mad, I'm afraid. Doesn't wanna come along and prove her innocence! [screams] [maniacal laughter] [Nancy] Please! [Luke] Take her clothes off! No! You! Get up! Come on! Get up! [whistles] Come on, poochie. Get in there. [shouting] Get in the cage! Come on! Hurry up! Well, I hope you two doggies are comfortable! [chortles] Enough, Cyrus! Enough! Look at the mess you made here! Gotta get the house cleaned up. Mama don't like it like this. You know she's got a bug for keeping things tidy. Cynthia, you gotta help us clean up the house, for Mama's sake, or else Mama is going to be mad. You had better go up and talk to her, Luke. You know darn well she's gonna chastise you for killing that other girl ahead of time. Mama said we're supposed to have three for the Easter services. I'll certainly have another by Good Friday. Now you have to go out and catch another one! And catching them is the dangerous part. People are liable to get wise. You and Cyrus and Abraham know that. How many times did Mama tell you? I'll go up and talk to Mama after the living room's straightened up! Mama won't yell at me for no reason, you wait and see! My name's Gwen Davis. He killed my sister. The two deputies-- the real ones could have saved us. But they're dead. You and I have to figure a way to get out of here before they kill us. [door unlocks] Please let us go. [laughs] You're young, like us. You must have some feeling for what we're going through. I'm not like you. Don't ever try to tell me that. I have special powers. You'll see for yourself come Friday at midnight when the services start. I didn't do a very good job of fighting back. I was in shock or something. Sally bit and scratched and they had a hard time with her. She kicked Cyrus-- the big, crazy one-- and then he stabbed her, again and again and again. I was half out of my mind. I was already in my cage. Two deputies stopped here. I could hear them talking on the front porch. They said they had been chasing this van that had gone speeding away from a grocery store in town. Luke must have been afraid or suspicious. Deputy said they had wrecked their car in the chase. Luke offered them some hot coffee and he brought a pot full out onto the front porch. I wanted to scream, but Abraham had a gun on me. The coffee must have been drugged because in a little while, the deputies were dragged in here, unconscious, and tied up with rope. They were tortured and stabbed to death. Why? Why is all this happening? It's my fault those deputies were killed. I was one of the people they were chasing. May God have mercy on their souls and on Hank's and Tom's. We have to try to escape. We have to try to get out of here. They'll kill us. The whole family is crazy. [knocking] Mama? I hope you don't have it in your head that I've done wrong. We didn't mean to kill the girl. But she hurt Cyrus pretty bad. You always said that Cyrus had a delicate temper. It was the girl's fault! And if Cynthia said otherwise, well, it just ain't so! Me and Abraham-- we'll go out and catch another girl tomorrow. We got us a van that don't belong to us. Nobody can trace it to us! Tomorrow, we'll take it out on the road. We'll find us another girl. Maybe somebody young and pretty. Maybe a virgin! Don't worry, Mama. Me and Abraham-- we won't disappoint you. Billy! Hey, Billy, we're gonna eat now. Billy! Come in and wash your hands. We're gonna eat. Here, catch! [laughs] This one pretty enough for you, little brother? Yep. This'll make Mama real happy. [chuckles] Over here. [Girl laughs] [muffled screams] Sharon? Sharon! Sharon? Sharon, what-- [gasps] [screaming] Luke! Come on, sweetheart. We're going for a walk. Up! [gasping] [grunts] [laughs] No! [grunts] [muffled moans] Nancy, don't give up on me, please! You do, we're as good as dead. Gotta figure a way to get out of here. But what can we do? We're locked in. [whimpering] There's no chance of trying to escape. Pull yourself together. [sniffles] Maybe I could try to seduce one of the brothers. It might get his guard down, and I'd kill one if I had to. [thud] [maniacal laughter] Cyrus! Cyrus, that's enough. That's enough I say. [door slams] "God, I'm heartily sorry for having offended thee. I renounce all my sins because I dread the loss of heaven and the pains of hell." Why do you pray? It will do you no good. Don't you believe in God? You believe your god is good and merciful. Yet he has allowed such bad things to happen to you. We're taught not to question his wisdom. He sent his only begotten son to earth to suffer and die for our sins. Maybe he's asking me to suffer a little too, so that I can be saved. Were you such a great and terrible sinner? There are times when evil will triumph and nothing can overcome it. Evil is more powerful than good. Even the son of God cried out in his final agony on the cross, "Why has thou forsaken me?" How do you do, sir? I'm Sheriff Cunningham. What can I do for you? I understand you're a lawman too? Ah, yes, sir. Look, it's about my daughter Nancy. Uh, she's a runaway, 17 years old. And I'm kind of worried she might come to harm. She left home because of a misunderstanding between the two of us. I'd like to find her and persuade her to come back. I promised her mother I'd try to make things right. I wouldn't blame myself too much if I was you. Lots of teenagers go bad these days. And the parents, or the stepparents, are not always to blame. Won't you sit down? Thank you. Now... what makes you think I can help you? You're not from around these parts, are you? Uh, no, sir. We make our home in the eastern part of the state-- Lewisburg. When Nancy left home two days ago, she was seen by a couple of friends of mine in a squad car hitchhiking. They went around the block to talk to her, make sure everything was all right. By the time they got there she was being picked up by two young fellas in a van. The deputies took down the license number, but they didn't bother to follow the van. They didn't see any reason to at that time, nothing seemed wrong. Are you trying to tell me you traced this vehicle here? Why, Lewisburg's 200 miles away. Yes, sir, we ran a check on the vehicle's license number through the state police. And we found out that your office has a bulletin out. It seems some teenagers stole some groceries here in this town. And they were driving a van with a license number that tallies with what I'm looking for. That's good police work, Mr. Johnson. Well, thank you. The only trouble is, I'm afraid, when and if I do find Nancy, she'll be facing a petty larceny charge. She's undoubtedly one of the kids you're looking for. Well, I hate to tell you this, but there's a good chance she may be in worse trouble. What do you mean? Why? That van was being pursued by two of my deputies. They dropped out of site. We found the squad car, abandoned, with the radiator smashed in and no sign of the deputies. My God. We've had some men out looking for them, but the people out here aren't much help. A lot of them are operating moonshine stills and they don't take too kindly to police officers. In fact, it's downright dangerous just to be asking questions in the back country. Yeah, well, I was kind of planning on looking for that van. I can't stop you, I reckon. If you don't get ambushed by those moonshiners, maybe you'll get lucky and find my deputies. I can show you on the map the exact spot where we found the abandoned squad car. Come on, take a look. Right over here. [ticking] ¶ [choral] It's midnight. Time to begin. [Sharon screams] [Cyrus laughs] [moans] We thought you'd like to meet our mama. [Cyrus, Luke laugh] [indistinct] [Mama] All right, Cynthia. It's midnight. Do it the way I taught you. Lucifer, we beg you to accept the sacrifice of this child which we now offer to you, to receive your blessings. Bless our deeds that we do in your almighty name. Consecrate the blood we've come to offer you, the blood we drink to show our oneness with you, the lord of hell. Oh, mighty lord Satan, we worship you with all our hearts and humbly submit to your desires and commandments. We believe, with everlasting conviction, that you are our creator, our benefactor, our lord and master... [continues praying] "Oh, my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended thee. And I renounce all my sins because I dread the loss of heaven and the pains of hell--" Nancy, praying's not gonna do you any good. We're done for. "Most of all, I renounce them because they offend thee, my God, who art all good and deserving of all my love." Lucifer, we ask you to bless her, the source of our communion. May her blood give us strength and vitality [gasps] Good-bye, Sharon. [screams] [Luke laughs] [gasps] [crying] Oh, my God! They've killed her! They've killed her! "May her soul [crying] and the souls of the departed rest in peace, o Lord, and may perpetual light shine upon her." By this blood, grant our beloved mother eternal life, oh, lord Satan, so that she, your faithful servant, may dwell among us forever. [ticking] By believing in you, may we live forever. By this sacrifice of blood grant us eternal life, lord Satan. Who's that dumb sucker following us? I don't think so. Let's not get jumpy. Let's just do what we came to do. Dig the grave deep, Cyrus. We don't want the rain to wash her up. Why couldn't we have waited until we killed Gwen and that other girl? What's her name? Nancy? We could have buried all three of them in the same hole. 'Cause Mama don't want it that way. Mama told Cynthia to bury them one at a time, just like we're doing. Well, Gwen gets it tonight. Last rites. And then Nancy on Easter Sunday. Yep. [Luke] That's the way Mama wants it. Well, I think we better get rid of this van before someone comes looking for the owner. Tomorrow. We'll drive it a long ways off, then dump it. Then we'll set it on fire. Big fire. You'd like that, wouldn't you, big brother? [laughs maniacally] [Abraham's voice] Why couldn't we have waited until we killed Gwen and that other girl? What's her name? Nancy? We could have buried all three of them in the same hole. [tires screech] [ticking] "Oh, my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended thee and I renounce all my sins because I dread the loss of heaven and the pains of hell." Lucifer, we beg you to accept the sacrifice of this child, which we now offer to you, so that we may receive your blessings. "O Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name." [whimpers] Oh, mighty lord Satan, we worship you with all our hearts and humbly submit to your desires and commandments. We believe, with everlasting conviction, that you are our creator, our benefactor, our lord and master. "Give us this day, our daily bread, "and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us." We renounce Jehovah, Jesus Christ, and all their works. And we declare to you, lord Satan, that we have no other wish but to belong to you for all eternity. "And lead us not into temptation, "but deliver us from evil. Amen." Lucifer, we ask you to bless her, the source of our communion. May her blood give us strength and vitality to do your bidding. May it grant us eternal life. [gasping] "May perpetual light shine upon her." By this blood, grant our beloved mother eternal life, lord Satan, so that she, your faithful servant, may dwell among us forever. "Grant her eternal light." By believing in you may we live forever. By this sacrifice of blood grant us eternal life, lord Satan. "May her soul and all the souls of the faithful departed "by the mercy of God, rest in peace. Amen." [grunts] Luke! Luke! Come on! Give us a hand! Freeze! Right where you are, fellas. Don't make any fast moves. Who are you? A cop? Never mind that! I'll ask the questions. Now, what'd you do with my daughter? Well...she might be right in front of you. [Cyrus laughs] Is her name Gwen or Nancy or Sharon? Her name is Nancy. You're in luck. She's in the house. Nice and comfy. [laughs] You go in there and get Nancy and bring her out here. How'd you find us? I traced the van. And I spied on you this afternoon. The sheriff knew who you were when I gave him your descriptions over the telephone. Now you do like I tell you. Go in and get Nancy. Bring her out here. [laughs] It's all right, Nancy. You're safe now. Nobody's gonna hurt you. Get over there! You two are under arrest. I'm taking you to the sheriff's office. Come on, honey. Get moving! [laughs] [Bert] Go ahead! [Cynthia screams] [Bert groans] [laughs] [gunshot] [gasps] [screams] [gunshot] [Abraham gasps] [exhales] [rattling] [gasps] [Cynthia gasps] [Nancy pants] [footsteps] [groan] [gasps] [groans] [gun clicking] [loud moan] [sighs] [pants] [shrieks] ¶ All the people surrounding you ¶ ¶ Don't want to be your friend ¶ ¶ All the hope keeping you ¶ ¶ Has finally reached an end ¶ ¶ And it's coming round to midnight ¶ ¶ You're all alone and it's midnight ¶ ¶ You're on your own You're all alone ¶ ¶ You can't go home anymore ¶ ¶ You're on your own You're all alone ¶ ¶ And midnight's at your door ¶
