The one who finds it will receive a beautiful fairy like you, with a crown on her head! OK? And your brother will receive a drum. He will use it for singing. How will he sing? La La La La... [Humming Radetzky March] - Yes? Do you agree? - Yes! - And what more should we have? - Little cars! - Little cars... - Come on! Let's find little some snails too! - Little snails? - Yes! Come on! Come on! Stand still now! What kind of snails? Little ones... like these? - Yes! - Yes?! What is it? - Look! Look, mum! - There you are! It's OK now? Come on! Let's eat a peach! What do you say about it? That's it! Make it clean! - I don't want any peach. Maybe later! - OK, shorty! - If you don't shut up, I'll shoot you! - Shoot me! Bang! Bang! What have you done to him? Let's see how he is feeling! Let's dance! We must feel the rhythm! OK? - Let's take some photos! OK? - OK! Well then... There you are! Let's dance! OK? Hey! Can you please take a photo for us? You must be careful! OK? You must come over here and look like this! OK? - Let's try it one more time! OK? - OK! There you are! Is it better this way? I want to be in front too! Me too! And now... stay like this! - The sunset is so beautiful! - Yes. It seems that the light tears apart! - Red, yellow, green... - The colors of the rainbow. Mitic? has told it to me. Blue, violet, orange... - That violet sunset... - Shut up! It's amazing. I didn't know that when the sun sets you could see all kind of colors. - What kind of shades do you see? - The shades made by the light! Oh! It's like a broken rainbow! Isn't it, ma'am? - Yes, of course! - See? I've told you! - What is there to see? - Why don't you fall? I've already been killed once today. How many times does this snotty - want me to die? - Since she shoots, why not? - Come on! You can shoot at me! - Bang! You are not dead! I'm not dead! Now, shoot her! In the heart! You can kill me now! - Bang! You're not dead! - There you are! - Take it easy, my dear! You'll get hurt. - Don't call me "dear"! - But you could hurt yourself. - Yes, indeed. You are very thoughtful! It was just a game. Can't you see that it was just a joke? But that thing... with the light... how can I put it to you... The rainbow is broken. Because during daytime the sun is hot and it joins - all those shades in a single light. - Seven colors and a single light! - That's what Mitic? has told us! - Yes! Yes! All right. All right. I will find out the truth. But who is this... Mitic?? - Our father! - Your father? - And... where is he? - He is training now! - He plays football! - Do you remember, milady... - Oh, my God! - That violet sunset... Keep still, Paula! Two more pins and you'll be ready! - I am tickling! - You are tickling... Oh... it hurts so much! Yes... you're right! She is happy. She has everything she has ever wanted She has a home, a car, kids and a boyfriend. What else could she want? - You are a model for me, madame. - Who? Me? Yes. You're a great woman! You haven't been goofy about a man. Whomever would he be! That's not something to brag about. We are not made to stay - in front of men like the pieces of stone. - Are you a member of the roving commision, - by any chance? - Yes. It's an exchange of experience! - I would go in your place too! - I wouldn't want that for you! - I am kind of silly, ain't I? - No. You're younger! - Here is your result, Doina! - Yes, thank you! - How do I look? - You're marvellous! That's what I thought too! I look at myself in the mirror, I study myself. And I want to know who I am. I want to be there... at my wedding... as they say! - Isn't it? - At your funeral? - One more pin and you'll be ready! - I wouldn't like to be present - at my funeral! - Are you crazy? What happened to you? I don't even want to think about that! - Such suffering! - Come here! Look! The music teacher from the technical school is dead! And the girls sing for her what she taught them to sing! I can't see anything! Why do you laugh? Have you seen something? Such suffering! Come here! You must see it too! It's something great! I promise you. - Yes. I am waiting. - My God! All those plans will be useless! Good bye! She's a fidget! She had been admitted to the The College of Textile Industry. And, in the second year, just like that, she gave it up! Since she had an affair with Mitic?... And she didn't even become his wife! But why should they marry? Mitic? has a boy with her. Isn't that enough? What about the girl? Isn't she his child too? Who knows? Some people deny it. The say that he is not the father for any of them! Then, their father is the Holy Spirit, isn't it? What are you doing here? When did you come? A few moments ago! Don't do that! Why? They know that you are my wife, Mrs. Filimon! - We are preparing for the show! - Good afternoon! Maybe we win the cup and we won't have any orchestra! An orchestra is all you need more! Can you bring in the kids? Do I have a choice? I bring in the kids and take care of the flask, - I clean carpets. Since it's an order... - It's not an order, it is a request! Go on! Take a shower! I'll wait for you! I went to see a doctor. I was examined in the testing room. - What kind of tests did you have? - Just some tests! Just some tests?! And why did you hide it from me? So, finally we will be married? I've waited it for such a long time! - Doina! - I had great hopes... Wait a minute. What do you mean? Why haven't you told me anything? - Mitic?! - Come on! Say it! Do you want to know what's all about? I don't love you anymore! Cut the crap! I've asked you something else! Come! Come! I'll wait for you and we go home. OK? - No! - Doina! I will leave myself, by bus! It will be just like a trip... - In the mountains... at the seaside... - Doina, what are you talking about? - Do you want to run away? - That's right! And you don't even want to see the children! Doina, wait! Tell me something! Don't you care about the kids anymore? - Answer me! - So, you are talking about the kids?! - Yes, I am. Do you want to fight here? - No. I want to leave! Listen to me, girl! So, you were examined in the testing room. And what's the meaning of all this? Maybe the results are unreal, fake. Just look at yourself! You're the most beautiful girl in the world! - You don't look like a sick woman! - Be careful. It might be contagious! And since it's contagious, you don't even want to say "good bye" to our kids! Mitic?, please, try to understand! At least, for a while... Hm! - I want to see the results! - Cut it out! I said it very clear! - I want to see them! - When I didn't feel good, I had gone home even on New Year's Eve! And I've told it to you, even then, - that we wouldn't be together all the time! - Wait! Wait! Doina! That night, you were dizzy. At that time you've told me that if you'd live with somebody else, I shouldn't interfere because it was your right to do it. I haven't said anything then. You were dizzy. What about now? Do you want to leave by bus and disappear, just like that? As if nothing would have happened? Without anyone knowing about it? And what about the children? What should I tell them? - That I am visiting my grandparents! - What grandparents? - Your grandparents! - My grandparents are dead. The children are too little. They won't realize it! That's what you think. Are you sure that you can trick them? You won't leave all by yourself. I'll come with you too. - No! - I will not let you go there alone! - I'll come with you. - No. I'll will search for you later. - I will write you from that place! - Doina, what's the matter with you? I will disappear for a few days. Don't bring the children to that place. You don't want them to see you that way, isn't it? Mm-hm. I don't want them to see me that way. - Doina, are you doing the right thing? - Mm-hm. - You have such a gift for it. - What are you talking about, dear? - You have such a special gift. - I have the gift to make a woman happy, As a bride, for the rest of her life, with a lovely lace gown. Yes, you are close to it, but it isn't that. You are very gifted. Please, believe me, Doina! You know how to be happy and make the others feel happy too. - Me? - Yes. Every little thing, every day, means a new happiness for you. And not only for you. Am I gifted with the power of finding happiness?! It would be swell. Comrade Mastacan, I've learned something amazing, on the radio. - What's that, Mia? - I've heard that God was dead! - I was there too! - He is dead and he is gone! What about our conscience? The head of quality control? Where is she? - What's the matter with you? Watch it! - It was just a thought... Forget about God. Honesty is dead... and love is dead too... Since she went at the seaside with... and she left him here... at the foot of... - Excuse me! - At the foot of the mountain! That's that! Honesty and love are dead. They are gone forever. They're sick on account of people's behaviour. Can you beat that, comrade Mastacan? - Leaving with a nobody, just like that? - To be... If you are faithful, you must obey no matter what. How can I remain silent when she cheats on him? Comrade Mastacan, have you ever heard about auto-ignition, referring to cars? You've heard that on the radio too, isn't it, babe? No, my dear. I've found out about it in my life. But why are you so mad about it? Since Doinica has left, something else will happen, comrade Mastacan. We are witnessing the phenomenon... no... that's not the right word. - We will be able to see the agony of love. - Do you mean Mitic?'s love? The agony of love, with capital letters. Auto-ignition and self-destruction are the phenomenons to be observed! If I was dropped out by a man who... assuming that I would have a boyfriend... Don't I have that right? - What would you do? Speak! - I would search for him at the seaside - And I would throw vitriol in his eyes. - Oh, you're "great"! What can I say? That's bullshit! I wouldn't go up the river for a guy like him! - I agree with you. - It is one thing to be dropped out by a man, and it is something different to be dropped out by a woman, isn't it? My dear, it's better that you drop out on them first. You're quite right. Step aside. I want to see how do I look! I don't like it! God damn it! I am sick and tired of white! - Why shouldn't we choose black? - Black? Have you ever seen a bride dressed in black?! What's the matter with you? What are you doing here? The girl is frightened. She always asks for matches. - Matches? - Yes. She has a candle under the pillow. A candle? Doesn't she want to die without a lighted candle? - Yes. She lights it and damp it. - I see. If the light provided by the wax is still good, I bet that the light of reason is burned down for her. She's just a jay! - Poor devil! How can we help her? - I can't do anything for her. I can kick her butt twice and move her into another ward. No. I can't sleep all by myself. I want to see the sea... the sun... the grass. - Did you come here to confess? - No. I can't stay here anymore. I want to run! I want to dance! I want to have children! - But you have children! - Yes, I do. But I'm scared! My body is weak! I have a persistent idea that I'm healthy. Yes, you're healthy! Let's go to the little match girl! Do you want to set this place on fire? Do you want to set the hospital on fire? - No! - What happened? It's just like you'd have sprained your ankle. Nothing bad could happen to you. Even if you jump out the window after the operation. Do you want to try it? Then, go for a walk in the greenwood, where no one's ever lost! Come on! Hurry! - But it hurts! - So what? You're not going to a prom! How many match boxes do you have under your mattress? - Six! - Here! Take another one! You have seven match boxes now. But when you go home, you must return all of them. If you don't proceed with it, I will cut your hair. - You? Would you do such a thing? - Yes. Yes. During the military service, I was the barber for the whole regiment. - Do you want to meet Figaro? - No. No. No. No. No. No. All women say such a thing, in the beginning. - No. No. No. - And afterwards they accept the haircut. - Don't you live in the countryside? - Yes, I do. And don't you know that those who are playing with fire and matches are liable to piss in bed during the night? If so, you will clean all the sheets from this place. Come on! Both of you! Take a walk in the greenwood, where no one can get lost. Do it now! - Don't you miss the children? - Yes, I do, Marta. I miss them very much. I can't wait to leave this place and see them again. I want to help Andrei with his homework and I would like to teach Iuliana a few poems. - Do you have a boyfriend? - Yes, Fane. You met him in Paraul Rece. It's the guy who repairs the machines used by the doctor. - Yes, I know him. What work does he do? - He is an electrician. He was my colleague in high school, but he doesn't allow me to work as an assayer. - Why not? - He says that the smell of chemicals - would be all over me. - I see. But this isn't really a problem. You can wash, you can use a perfume or a cream... Yes, but I don't want to be too coquette because he is kind of jealous. He usually makes reproaches to me and tells me often that I must not eat too much. - And that I will gain weight, if I do it. - What? To gain weight? At your age? Yes, but... I kind of like sweets... ice cream... chocolate... That's very good! You can eat them! I tell you what we'll do. We'll do some exercises and we'll run! Do you want to jog? Yes. But what do you think the doctor will say about it? He will allow it to you. When you are healthy. I use to run with Fane. But he wants us to run in the mountains. - Then, you must run! Run with him! - What about the job? - You can go away one Sunday. - He can't do it. - He is busy with football on Sundays. - Football? What would you do? Would you run? I can't understand why you baptised this rock "Faust". Oh, I see. It's a little romance here, sir! As an old man, you could still see the world from behind these gullies. I got it, isn't it? What is the meaning of it? - Whatever you want it to be. - Yes... I will show you something quite clear. A human being. Look! Do you recognize her? Don't eat all the time. You'll get sick. Come on, Doina! The professor is waiting for you. You came here in order to work again! Is that so? I'll be damned! Yes... I haven't carved a stone for years... And I've considered all this period as an empty existence. Here... in my world... between my rocks... as you say it... I feel like at home. When I stay here, I think that nobody expects my death. What do you think about his face, Doina? He thinks that his enemies want to destroy his work. The rocks... Of course, they would praise him after his death! Come on, move! Don't you sit there like an old woman! - Come on! Faster! Or I will cut your hair! - How are you, Doinita? I'm fine. What about you? You're fine! Oh, my! People are like this! They don't see each other for years and then they are talking pleasantry! How come all your pupils praise you? I've heard them! I'd be a lot more circumspect if I were in their shoes. Their praises do not offer me the everlasting feeling of life. I feel that a new joy is arousing inside of me. Now. Here. Take it easy, professor. She is not herself lately. Is she ill? Yes, maybe loneliness makes her suffer, like it was before. - I don't really know this problem. - I'm glad to see you, Doinita. - But you are not glad to see me. - Why do you say that? - I feel that you are very distant! - Distant? You've never known what I think. - Never? - Exactly! Anyway, now it's too late! - It's too late for me to guess? - The professor knows better how to ensoul and guess what the marble "thinks". Doina and Maricica were in love with you. - A long time ago... - Maybe... maybe... But if I should ask you something now, then I would demand you not to be in love with me anymore. Yes... yes... I feel like an old man. You were dear to me too... for a while. - As all my pupils were dear to me. - I wouldn't give her any chance now. On the contrary, I would ask her to forget about me. It would be silly for someone to waste the time with a guy like me. But the art is beyond the reality! Aren't you just like Faust? The professor is cuddling now. It is a diabolic way to make them care about him. Doina thinks that these words are a late declaration of love. - Listen to me, doctor! - Yes! I've known, a long time ago, a guy named Scarlat, a young painter. - He is familiar to you, isn't it? - Yes. He was very ill. He wasn't afraid of dying. He feared that he wouldn't be able to paint. - That he couldn't finish his paintings! - Then what? He died... in a few weeks. He painted all the time when he was alive. Maybe this was the meaning of his life. To paint... all the time! - The meaning of my life is... - Don't interrupt him! Carry on! In the end... the body must return to dust... from which it was made. All these years, when I did not work, I felt that my body was dead. What about these monsters? These ghosts? What is the meaning of it? The Celebration of Grapevine. It is a custom, from my village. - Other people from the Orient keep it! - I see! Women and men, youngsters and old people are plucking the grapes and they celebrate. - I got it! What are they doing next? - The lads dance and afterwards - they are looking for wives. - Yes, the heifer seems to be in love! She is not interested about anything in the world. She only wants to stay near the old man. He is Pan, the goat, isn't it? No. He is just a man who is in love. An old man... - It's like a dream! - But it is something moral? I don't know. Anyway, it has the artist's touch. But it is moral too. Tell me, please! What ugliness do you see in love? Oh, yes. He wants to ensoul the rock! That way he will make of it, an agent of corruption! The art corrupts, Doina! Here is his follower! By this art, elusive as the gates of hell, he doesn't allow others to see the truth as it is. And he talked all kind of nonsense about Manole... Sisyphus... They were only words... ideas without any value... The artists... the eunuchs... those who don't have the power to give life anymore, since it was taken away from them, they hate life. And they are starting to bedevil it, giving it no value whatsoever. All these are just some ghosts, the prophecies of an eunuch. That's just it! If you curse an eunuch, you'll never get your tongue bitten. - It wouldn't be the same if you praised him! - Naturally! A diligent guy carved the stone all day long! This is what he could do and that's what he did. But he has never had a gift for it. This is not a burden when you are aware of it. You continue to be a good artisan. But there's almost a tragedy when you do not realize that there is nothing divine in your work. So the discontentment sets in When your work is not appreciated. Maybe he is an artisan, but a genius... The world is something else! Hey, are you out of your mind? I've told you to walk, not to overdo it! Come on! Quick! You must come back in your room. It will rain! Come on! Come on! Come on! Faster! Take this and put it on your head! What are you doing here, Doinita? How can I help you? You could leave the place as fast as you can! - This would make you feel better? - No! - It would straighten you! - Doina! Nobody ever ordered me anything. But I will listen to you. Then, you must command it to yourself and listen to it, professor! Doina, get away from the rain. You'll catch a cold. I want to see you again! I want to make your portrait one more time! Cut the crap, professor! You've chosen a "good" moment! It rains! - I want you to pose for me. Once again! - Come on! We'll be soaked! - Come on! Say my name! Just now! - Doina! Come on! All right, Serban! What are you talking about? Haven't you figured it out yet? Come on! Get in your rooms! You can leave him here. He likes the rain! He is prolific now. Doina! You are not at all a good girl! Come on! - Who? Mitic?? - Eat the cake as you should eat it! He is here! Good luck! I think you should tell him, professor! You can straighten him... and comfort him. - What could I tell him? - The truth! What are you talking about? You should tell him that they are his children! - Well, they are his children! - That's good! Very good! But he is not sure of it anymore. You must help him. That's it! Don't you think that this is a trifle! I know. Someone could suspect that if you say it, you'll make it even harder to believe. And they could say that you want to seem benevolent since they are not yours. That way, he could sleep tight and he might be concerned about them. We're not talking about alimony here. You can restore peace of mind to him. Yes, I think you are right. I will do it. That's very good. Excuse me! You know what people say? Those who are familiar with the issue? They say that she does not recognize him as the father of her children. And she also says that the children bear no resemblance to him. - We have some beautiful youngsters here! - Hello! Hello! - I am not alone. I am with... - I know. I know. I've seen the professor. We have almost finished here. If I can give you a lift... No, thank you. Come to our table! I hope that you are not angry at Serban! - Angry at him? Why? - Well... - Are you pupils? - No, we are at College. - What are you studying? - I am studying mechanics. - I see... none of you studies art? - No. Thank you. - Don't you like art? - Yes. I'll wait for you outside. - Have you ever been at any of my exhibitions? - No. Never?! Then, you must wait a little bit more. - Doctor, what happens with Doina? - Look at him! He thinks he's funny! - He wants to show his modesty! - No way! I agree with you. He wants to bewitch them. He is an artist. - Doctor, I... - He's hypocrite. I wouldn't be surprised to find out that he had tried to make fun of you. He'd tell you that he didn't know Doina. - And that the kids are yours! - But I am their father! Yes? Of course! This is the truth. They look like you. But... as a consolation... he could tell you that you were their father. That way, you would take care of them. And he won't pay any alimony. - What are you talking about?! - I am talking about alimony! - But I don't need his money! - Of course, brother! This isn't the point! I want to show you what he could do. That way you can be sure that you haven't been cheated with... - I haven't been cheated! - Listen! - I tell you that I am right! - Yes? Of course. Of course. Then, he shouldn't tell you that they are your children. - He won't do it. - But what if he does? He won't tell it. He is not such a big son of a bitch. Even if he loved her once. All right! Just watch it! Come on! Go home! You've exhausted the professor! Another time! I'm very sorry! Please! Thank you! Good bye! - Good day, professor! - Take a seat! Thank you. - No. No. Just a little bit! - Oh! Excuse me, please! He is a brilliant doctor. But sometimes he acts like a teenager. Yes... Sometimes he seems to be a son of a bitch, but I think it's his own way to cuddle himself, isn't it? No, I don't want anything! Go to your father. He wants to talk to you. - You know, professor... - Let's go home, Mitic?! - Let's go home, daddy! - This girl will become a very nice woman. She's a dead ringer for Doina... and for you too... You have a big beard, mister. Don't you want to play with me? - Her eyebrows are just like yours! - No. They're just like Doina's eyebrows. - Yes? It is possible. - Mister, I have a doll. Her name is Doina. - That's my mother name too. - Anyway, she has something from you too. - It's something in her look. - What's your name? Do you want to play? On the other hand, the boy is a dead ringer for you. Come here! - Look how he walks! - Does he walk just like me?! Yes. He walks like a man. You have two very beautiful children. - You'll be very happy by their side. - Yes... They are my children... Yes. Of course. Of course. - How old are you? - I am seven years old. - Would you like to be my son? - No. No, sir. We are Mitic?'s kids. Come on! Faster! Get over here! - Come on! Yous must take a nap! - What are you doing? Going so soon? - See you! - That's too bad! - You had a fight! - No. Why do you think that? He didn't even say "good bye". He is just a football player. For him, the only real thing is the ball. Professor, we must fight against the insidious conspiracies of reality. Move closer, towards the window. That's it! Smile now! Come on! You mustn't hesitate! You are looking fine. - Does it hurt? - What's wrong with him? - What's wrong with him, doctor? - Nothing! - What's the matter with you? - I am fine. - Then, why don't you play? - I won't play! How's that? Those bandits will beat us and the boys will lose their bonuses. - I can't play! - Please, you must make an effort! - Come on! Doctor, give something to him! - What could I do? Slap him twice? I don't know. You must do something. Give him a shot. He must walk. I think he went batty. Dobrescu can replace him. He is fit to play now. Dobrescu! Dobrescu, you will play! Come on, boys! That match will begin. You have a big chance today, Dobrescu. You will play from the first minute. Doctor! Doctor! Dear and beloved viewers, this game will be watched by the great sculptor, Valeriu Serban. He is the son of our town! Let's cheer him! He was my drawing teacher in high school. And Doina's too. Didn't you know it? No. I don't know a lot of things. I wasn't interested and I didn't ask anyone. - Come on! Play ball! Why don't you do it? - Everyone knows the big artist. That's bullshit! He was more a ladies man than an artist. - Come on! Faster with the cross! - Why do you say that? Is he dead? Yes. A long time ago. Oh! What a miss! Oh, my! Are you asleep or what? - I ask you again. Is he dead? - Yes, I've told you. He's dead as an artist. - What about his works? - His works?! The ones from the wood? Those were just a short experience in the Balkans. None of his works was exhibited in Paris or London. And neither the experts from Paris will come here to see them. Or to touch them. I don't know much about this kind of things. But I think it's interesting. - Nonsense! - What about Doina? What does she think? Doina? She finds them interesting, of course. It's obvious that... - What's obvious? - Wait a minute! - Oh! He hit the post! That's marvellous! - What's obvious? It's obvious that Doina and her mates visited the professor pretty often. They went in order to pose. As a group, of course. We must wake up. Otherwise, we will be overwhelmed. - She has never told you that? - No. We're talking about the high school years. Serban was still a professor in this place. Serban! He was a mystic, in a sort of a way. He was in love with art like Moses loved Jahve. Excuse me. A lot of people joked about him. Come on! Trick him! Oh, my God! You're a bunch of sissies. They've scored. - Tell me about it! - What do you want to know? Oh, yes. He was a mystic. He saw a kind of a cloud. It was made from smoke. Like Moses... and Brancusi... Brancusi went barefoot to Paris... And he became an immortal artist. Come on! Come on! Why do you keep following me like that? - Can't you understand anything? - I wonder why are you talking to me about these men. I am only interested in... - Tell me. Is it bad? - Why do you think that? - Because you're beating around the bushes! - I've talked to you openly. - From man to man. Take it easy. - I hope that you've understood me. I've missed the goal. I've missed it. That's your fault. And you still don't understand anything. Go in there and play. It's 1-1. Come on! You can score more! You must do it without him. He has deserted you. Bravo! Can you believe it? I am asking all the lunatics to do their job. Yes. Come on! Run! Run! You can't stay like that. Come on! Move faster! Hello, doctor. I've brought you something. - Leave me alone, mister! - Hello, ma'am. I think that they will defeat us. What can we do? Come on, Ilie! You must pass. Good job, Doru. Take the ball! You can score. Doctor! Do you remember about a woman, Aglae? You've operated her. - Look at him! Look at him! - I've brought you some whiskey, coffee... And some cigarettes, on account of Aglae. My beloved one, Aglae. I don't want to hear anything about Aglae. Wait a minute, doctor. It isn't possible. You're offending me. It's cheap. [Indistinct] She is a happy human being. She has all that she wants. She has a house, a car, children and a beloved one too. She can't possibly want another thing. What are you doing here, Mia? What about you, Pia? - We came here to see Doina. - Nonsense! - You want to admire the old man's rocks. - Why are you saying that? We like them. Indeed? So, this old lover boy put you under a spell too? - Yes. - Come on! Go home! - Why? - You can't see Doina. - Why? - Just like that. You can't see her. Why? He's such a grouch. Let's go! - But what's the problem? - I think it's something pretty bad! He takes the rock and carve it. And he obtains a sort of wings. That way, he gets pinned. He uses some nails made of steel. - Some nails made of iron. - The blood blew out. But he didn't care. Because it was the will of God. - Hey! - He got pinned! And he used the wings. - And he flew... - Why do you laugh? And then he fell. And he had the fate of someone who carried the cross. Martha told us these stories in high school. Pretend that you don't see him. - Mitic? is coming. - How can I do it? Can't you see that... - Yes, I see. - Hello, girls! You look wonderful. - What a good joke! Are you kidding us? - Me? Doina, what's the matter with you? Haven't you seen me or what? - No! - Yes. And we thought that you'll have the courtesy to leave us alone. I've brought you a book. I know you like it. The kids are all right. I haven't asked you anything. Martha, haven't I the right to be alone? - At least now! - You're talking nonsense! - Everybody is hopeful. - Do you know why, Martha? - They think about the game on Sunday. - I'll hit you, if you don't cut the crap. It was a good number for him. Every time he said it, he would make me laugh. - Look at me! I am not laughing now. - You'll laugh. I'm sure. Come on, Doina! Did we have such a terrible time together? Martha! Everything began at the seaside. In the light of the morning... In the light of the sunset... the sun... the sea... Afterwards, everything became sad. Don't tell me you've been happy all the time. Don't you dare to pretend that I was everything for you. I am like the light of your eyes?! Give me a break! That's how the football players try to make an ode for love. - The compare it with the light. Go now! - You haven't got a chance! - I will never leave you! - But I will leave you, my darling. Can't you see? You are threatening and cockering me, at the same time. - What can I think? - You can think what you want. - You love me, Doina. I know it for sure. - Come on! Come on! I am hopeful, Doina! Can you hear me? I am hopeful! Cut the crap! You're a pessimist! Pessimist! Listen to me! The one who feels how his horns grow, he is always a pessimist! Because he's sure that he hasn't had just two of them. Come on! You can laugh. I've made a good joke. Do you want a cigarette? I forgot. You don't smoke, you're playing football. The artists are very happy, professor. They don't have troubles like ordinary men. They're worried about the eternity. Look at you! You're looking great. The fresh air is good for you. And for you too. You have a good stability. Who is the one incarnated in this rock, by the professor, in the green woods, - where no one can be lost? - You are. - Nonsense. - You'll bore Mitic?, doctor. Who is deserted on the roof of the monastery by Negru Vod?? And even by fate itself? Who? Manole, my beloved ones. Our artist, alive in the folklore. Yes, Manole is here. And Icarus, who wanted to escape From the labyrinth situated in the island of Crete, which wasn't a labyrinth of love, made some feathered wings. I must say it. He glued the wings from his body, with wax. - Doina! - Leave me alone. It's shameful! The professor left you. But he wasn't a jerk. He has realized that - you couldn't have a future, together. - And now, as a couple, we would be unhappy, isn't it? That's what you think? - No. You do, because you're crying. - I cry because I've lost my illusions. What kind of illusions? Do you want me to be like him? - You have a crazy notion about happiness. - Leave me alone! Stop it! - Cut it out! - It is well known... The wax was melted due to the heat, not because of love, smart aleck! And Icarus crushed into the sea. Do you understand it? - I can't hear you. - That's natural. If nobody listens to me... Ladies and gentlemen, I see that you all run away, when somebody talks about art. And you bounce into the real life, where there is no escape. Even Manole, the deserted one, wanted to reach the real life, in order to live between human beings... Am I right, professor? Am I minimizing something? Listen to me carefully, my darling! - She wants me to be like him? - And do exactly what I say! If I had a certain material condition... If I'd played at least in the second league... Art and flight are just like love. They all last like a streak of lightning. Real life brings out only human misery. There is no escape. She was afraid about the future. She wanted to have a certain position. No one can understand me? No one?! - Am I nobody? - Professor! I've read your interview in the newspaper. "Deserted on the sacred roof". Manole has created some wings that were planted into the flesh. The sun couldn't have melted them, like wax. - That's what you've told me then too. - Really? - Yes. - I haven't got the time - to achieve this project so far. - I hope that you would be so lucky. I've read the article too, professor. I can tell you privately that... - I can give you a lift, if you want it. - They can't understand anything. I'm sure. We'd rather like to go somewhere and offer us a beer or something. I think that the project... or maybe I am wrong... Anyway, I think that Manole's wings are too heavy. Just like that. Feathered wings are more powerful. On the other hand, the wings used by Icarus are good. But wax can't resist much. There is no escape. The symbiosis between man and bird is not good. It could never last. It isn't good. Don't you talk much with the newspaper men. - You'll just make a fool of yourself. - I forgot my keys. Doina has them. I'll catch up with you. Have you seen his muscles? The ones from his feet. Our feet are more like some sticks. Or like toothpicks. There is no escape. Come on! Let's drink a beer! What do you want? - Did you want me to be like him? - He will always be unhappy. Because he didn't have the guts to be happy. He wasn't brave enough - to stay beside you. - How can you be so sure? - Because you were not his woman. - Yes. Because he didn't want. - No. You didn't want it. Because... - Because you were in my life. - And I loved the football player. Is that it? - No. - You are an honest woman. That's all. - You're talking nonsense, my boy. Anyway, let's say you're right. What does it have to do with my love for you? Tell me. There is no kind of connection with it. I am not a saint. I am a woman, like any other woman. And if you don't leave me alone, I'll slap you. Get out of here! Doctor! - Has he gone? - Yes, he's gone. There are gone. All of them. Now I understand everything. You want to humiliate him. And you wanted to do it when other men were present too. It's because you want to alienate him from you. How can you stand it? He is suffering so much. He was like a drowned kitten. Didn't you have - any pity on him? - Yes. I feel sorry for him. Especially when I see that Serban does not respect him at all. - He was struggling. And he kept quiet. - Martha, it means that... - He hated you? - No. It means he's very fond of me. Then, why are running from him? Why do you reject him? Martha, I am testing myself. I want to see if I can live without him. - What's the answer? - I am trying to live without him. I have lived alone all this time, Martha, only with my love beside me. I was thinking about him, all the time. Martha, women are so dumb. We are always acting like some schoolgirls. - I am talking nonsense. - No. You are always telling beautiful things. Look! He has brought you flowers too. Doina! Tell me something! This lady, from Holland, wants a dress for herself? She'll get married? No, my dear. She will open a retail store, exclusively for the brides. Oh! Lucky for him that he's a football player. Otherwise he wouldn't have had - such difficult work in the factory. - Difficult?! Yes. You know what I mean. He looks at us without paying any money. Oh, doctor! Do you want to get married? - Do you want a dress? - You can pick one for me. - What's the size of the bride? - She's just like you. Like us?! But we are not anybody's wives. - And this is my fault? - What is a wife, doctor? It's like something unknown, like a ticket. You mean that you can't be sure about anything, once you get married. These are the facts of life. Of course, there are exceptions too. Like the marriage that will bring Doina and Mitic? together. I've told you to leave me alone. A marriage, as a rule in our life, is like a forecast. Can't you be sure about the weather from the next day? - You can be sure... sometimes. - Yes. In the summer... it is shiny... But sometimes... out of this clear sky... a nasty storm suddenly appears. We must admit it. Any marriage is a big risk. - Am I right, girls? - And would you never assume such a risk? - At least as a period of trial... - I would not feel comfortable If I had to say to a certain woman: "You're my biggest dream come true". Madame, you're my biggest dream come true. Madame, you're my biggest dream come true. I understand. You don't want to deceive a woman. - I would deceive myself. - You can deceive me. I can't do it today. I must keep guard. - But I can do it tomorrow. - OK. Tomorrow. Doctor, I can't understand that thing, about wax. - Wax? What do you mean? - The one from the wings. The wings are good. The body is good. But the glued wings didn't last. - What did you want to say by that? - If you are lucky, you can live. That's what I meant. What did you understand? - I haven't understood anything. - That's better. Blessed are the poor in spirit. Doctor, I can't seem to know what kind of man you are. - I seldom consider you a cattish wriggler. - I am listening to you. Even the facts with Serban and my kids... from the other day... - I think that you've arranged everything... - Me?! Go on! I am wrong, isn't it? You're not a wriggler. I can go on? - Please do! - You really thought that he was their father. Look! Here is a wedding dress! It's a present from me. Be careful how you use it. - What are those geese up to now? - We want to get married too. Aren't we allowed to do it? We want to be like all the others, my dear. But who will marry you, my dear? Do you think that anyone would do it? Well, doctor Iuga would be interested... Or even Mitic?... - Mitic? is available, isn't it? - He became a target for you, I'm sure. - Why not? Has he any weaknesses? - He doesn't have any weakness. But you have enough for both. - Iuga's swans! - I wonder why he keeps them. Maybe he loves only his swans. And he calls me "goose". - Ah! I have an idea! - What do you mean? If you don't want him to call you like that anymore... - Oh, my! But I don't have... - You must put on the wig... - How do I look? - You are so beautiful! - I am speechless. - I am looking like a stork, isn't it? When you saw me earlier, you were startled and you went away, professor. - Why did you do it? - I was in a hurry. Ah! You were in a hurry, isn't it? And now? It's the same. I must call a friend of mine. He is living in Bucharest. - Are you sick, by any chance? - No. Why do you say that? - You are pale. - It's because of the heat. - You're a little pale too. - Yes. Because I am angry. - But what happened to you? - I don't like the retired ladies' men. You will be old too, someday. It isn't a guilt. - Tell me! What is it all about? - I've found out that a former professor, - who instructed Doina... - Go on... Boasts all over town that he was in love with her. Yes... Do you think that's wrong? I was in love too with my pupils, in some way. Excuse me for a minute, please. - Are you talking about me? - Since you look at me so lofty, - I should say not. - I don't need to justify myself to you. - You don't have any hold over her. - I don't have any hold over her?! We are parents for two children. Do you understand it? - Yes. But she doesn't admit it. - She doesn't admit it?! How do you know it? - This is the talk of the town. - Listen to me! Whether you like it or not, - we have two children together. - I have work to do. Leave me alone. - This is a sculpture. It isn't just football. - So, if you don't like it... Get out of the water right now! Listen, you football player! - This my field of work. Get out! - Doina, nothing has happened here. - Doina, nothing has happened here. - Mitic?, what are you doing here? I don't shout. I am not hysteric. Everything is all right. - Why did you come here? - Everything is... I came to see the statues. - I wanted to learn something. Forgive me! - He wants to learn something?! - I introduce him to you. It's the professor. - I know him. I liked him a lot. - That's natural. He is a big artist. - I liked him not as an artist, but as a man. - What are you doing here? - Doina! - What are you doing here? - Doina, I've actually come here... Why did you come here? Has someone phoned you that he would hold my hand? - No. - Why have you come? Tell me! - I've come here of my own will... - Go on... - I want you to be my wife! - Don't you tell me! - We must wed! - What a good joke! - Life itself is a good joke! - Are you mad? - I've arranged everything with the papers. - Forget it! - Stop it! - Look. I've even bought a bridal veil. It's "B7", imported from Holland. Would you like to be my Dutch girl? - It's late. - No, it isn't. - It's useless. - No, it isn't. I see. If you don't want it for you, you desire to be like that for the children. No. I want it for me, in the first place. Can't you see it? - For me! - Do you want me to be a bride? It isn't wet. - How do you find the water, professor? - He is not right. He isn't. - She admired me. That's all! - Take it easy! Take it easy! All pupils admire their teachers. This is a fact of life. - Art has no connection with real life. - By Jove, it ain't like that! Leave me alone, sir. I can do it by myself. You are my Dutch girl! Doina! I've picked on him, it's true. But I haven't done it for nothing. Everything turned out just fine. There is no doubt about it. You'll be the most beautiful bride. Oh, my love! - Listen to me, comrade! - Yes? Look! Here! - Yes. Come in! - Good afternoon! Ah, Gullit! Tell me all about it! If you operate Doina, can I be there too? - No. - It isn't customary? That's right. It isn't a football game. We are not in a stadium. You wouldn't help at all. Neither of us. - Do you afraid that I might cry? - You wouldn't be the first one to do it. Take a walk in the city. Go to a movie. You can do everything you like. - Doctor, I would still... - What would you want me to do? You ask me if I understand you? I understand you perfectly, sir. Come on! Get back in the ward. You must respect my prescription. You'll be back home in three days. The football player who is a hero! The man who scored the winning goals, the God of stadiums, has fallen in love, out of pity, with an unhappy girl. - Out of pity?! - Yes. You've loved her - because she was unhappy. - Go on! You wanted to submit her. It was a selfish act. You wanted to prove that no one could be happy without you. - What? Whom should I prove it to? To her? - No. To yourself. - Do I look so stupid? - Yes, you do. Because if you knew that she had feelings for another man, you could let her be together with him, out of a selfish nobility. You'll give up on her... for Serban... Because you like to appear in a game and leave it whenever you want. You want to be the star and fulfill destiny. You want to score the decisive goal. Come on! Take a walk! I am busy. - You are behaving like a ruthless man. - I am ruthless and chinless. I don't have the time to explain to every idiot that he can't stay here. - You could be a little more human. - My dear, I know that for many of my coevals, I am a celebrity because I am ruthless and chinless. You can't be different when you're doing my kind of work. Mitic? can be hearty for me too. - I see. You are from the big league. - I am the best. - And you are modest too. - Not at all. I am sick and tired of modest and hearty men who can't do their job properly. What are you doing? Why haven't you left yet? Do you want to cry? Get out of here! - Doctor! - Yes? - Haven't you ever despised yourself? - No. What about you? - Yes. Now I do. - Why? - Because I can't kick your ass. - Don't you try it. I don't think you would have any chance. I've been studying martial arts. - And I must operate someone too. - Mitic?! Come on! Why did you call me down here? Do you to admire the rocks created by Serban from a boat? Of course, he belongs to posterity. I mean he only cares about posterity. He has never loved anyone. - But he loved me. - That's what you think! Or you would have liked it to be that way. He has only loved his fictions, made of stone... His beauties, made of marble... They will be a heritage, for the whole world. Nonsense! Please, give me a break! I don't need such things. Don't tell me that he has sacrificed like Manole. He is not a big artist. Not even a poor one. He is just a cobbler. - That's what he says. - Yes, with humility. - Because he can't be different! - You are cynical! - OK! Whatever! - You don't really feel what you are saying. People say that you can't even be ironic, like someone should be. - And what else do people say about me? - They say that you are repellent and crazy. - And they say that you are ill. - I am ill? How's that? You have never known how to lie. That's why a man is never good - and completely zany. - Here is the philosopher. You can find her in the garment industry. This is my work. It's cynical. But doctors save people. They heal only the ones that can be saved. - If you must live, you live. - You are cynical like... Like death itself. Say it! I don't mind at all. I am honored. Death is a part of my life. I can't laugh like an idiot. And I can't see "la vie en rose". I can't shout it. But life can be beautiful too. It is beautiful, if this rose exists. Excuse me. I don't know how to explain it to you. But I was happy. - Like a pale rose. - You can say what you want. - Mitic? loved me. - Yes. Because he lives for today. He is a practical man. He kicks the ball and he scores. 2-0! And he wins. It is something for the present. But why did you want me to come here? Since you operate me, you must cut my hair too. - He really loved you? - Yes. - It means that he is still loving you. - Why do you say that? Because after you've treated him like you did and sent him away, you've told him that you had never loved him. You wanted to make him forget you and despise you. That way, he could have a new life afterwards. You are a hell of a man. You can cut to the quick. No one but you could have done it. Come on! Cut my hair! - You're talking nonsense! - I have a wig too. Who else could do it? Mitic?? You've said that I want to make him forget me. - It is true. - It means that I am hopeless. You don't give me any chance. You're a nasty cynical. - You can call me what you like, if it helps you. - You look at me as if you are searching peace. You live every day in that place, full of sorrow and mourning. Do you think that you can say everything that's in your mind to set you free? - Yes, I do. I have this right. - So, you are more important than the ones who suffer! Otherwise, you'd get mad. Or you would begin to collect stamps or icons. You need a vice. You must say what you think. It's like a shield for you. That way, you can save yourself. Come on! Cut my hair! Cut it, Figaro! - I have never cut a woman's hair. - That's too bad! But you wanted to cut my hair, when we were in high school. Do you remember? I came to you. And the next day, you said: "If I catch her, I will cut her hair"! There you go! You've caught me! It's better to cut it. I don't want to see it falling, during the night, on my pillow. - I want you to cut it completely. - So, do you want to look like a baby? - No. I want to look like a soldier. - You've said that I'd like to save myself. You could ask me why don't I love anyone. Yes. Why don't you love anyone? Because I've loved someone once. And that's enough. I don't like to recur. - I loved you. And that's all! - Why are you telling me that now? - It was just once! - Why are you telling me that now? - You're a dope! - That's what you've told me then. - When I've asked you out, to see a movie. - You've asked me to go to your place. - I don't remember that. - You're lying. You don't want to remember. Did you have, by any chance, a cinema, at your place? Maybe I didn't understand that. I had invited you because it was my birthday. All our schoolmates came there. You were the only one who didn't want to come. Don't move your head. - Otherwise I can't cut your hair. - I was so cocky, isn't it? And that's why I didn't come there. Why haven't I come? Because when we were at the athletic field, I had touched your ass. It was your call! It isn't true. I was in love with Serban. He had asked to take a walk in the park - with him and to eat an ice cream. - You had a swell hat! - You were beautiful. And he was ugly. - Who was ugly? - That cocky geezer! - He wasn't like that at all. For any boy, the older guys were just some geezers. You're a fool! - That night I was his lover. - You've made love with him?! Is it really important? He is still an oddball. I loved him just the way you've loved me. Why have you reminded me of all those things? Do you want me to forget the present? Do you want me to forget that I'd never leave your hospital healthy? Do you want me to forget about my death? Why did you remind me of it? - Answer me! Why? - Cut the crap! Can't you see that I am turning you in someone more beautiful? Keep still! I know it hurts. But you've wanted a military haircut. You want me to forget that I'd never leave this place healthy. - I hate you! - I love you! - I hate you! - I love you! - I hate you! - I love you! I hate you! Put on make up, Martha! I want to look as if I'd be 18 years old again. Look at her! She suffers so much! Martha, I... - I will die anyway... - You're talking nonsense. Love has given you the power to live so far. I will powder your face. And you'll get married. - And everything will be swell. - You're lying. You're lying to me, Martha. Why do we get married? What do we want to prove? We must show the world how tough we are? Or how much do we love each other? Even the white shoes are made for brides from Holland. If they make you feel uncomfortable, you must resist and keep quiet. I've taken a bath and I've used a lot of scent. I want that everything should be alive... normal... and true. But everything is true, Doina. We'll have godparents and witnesses. We'll hold hands. We'll do everything by the book. Yes. We will live a great moment. Even death is something futile, if we compare it with such a moment. That's what you want, isn't it? And this wedding will make me healthy again. That's what you think, isn't it? It's like a bad novel. Listen to me, Mitic?! I feel that we will be together just for a short time. - No. We will live a long time together. - One month? One day? How much? As long as we can't forget each other. Oh, my! We have such a beautiful mother! Come on, Andrei! You can come too! - We have such a beautiful bride! - You are very beautiful, mother. As long as you and the children are healthy, I will be alive too. - I love you, mother! - I love you too! - My little one! Do you want to play? - Yes. - How do you want to play together? - I love you, mother. I love you too. Clamp! - I am hearing something. What is it? - Some children are singing downstairs. Is it New Year's Eve? At least, in such a night, they are entitled to sing carols. - Maybe a radio is turned on nearby. - Some children are singing in the park. - Do you want me to make them go away? - Clotting! Do you want me to make them go away? Can't you concentrate? Be careful! Or I will make you go out on the window. - Do you think that she can hear us? - Clotting! - Raspatory! - Yes. Do you think that she can hear us? She can hear how dumb you are. Absorption! Absorption! - What's her pulse? - It's normal. - Blood pressure? - 120/70 mm Hg. Clamp! Arrange my glasses! Thank you! Raspatory! [Maurice Ravel - Bolero] Ionut's grandmother said that Adam and Eve... - What's about them? - She says that Eve was created - from Adam's rib. - Is it true? - Yes, it is true. - It means that our mother - was created from a rib of yours. - Yes. - It means that you have one rib less. - Yes. Come on! - Come on! Everybody will go to bed! - It means that Ionut's grandmother - says the truth? - Of course. Has she ever lied? She told us yesterday that mother wasn't at our grandmother. - She says that mummy is in a hospital. - She lies. It means that you don't have one rib less than mother? - That's right! - Then, what is the truth? The truth is that you must go to sleep. Right away. Is that clear? - Yes. - Turn off the light! - Are you sleeping? - Yes. - Have you fallen asleep? - Yes. Good night! - Andrei! - Yes! Mitic? doesn't know anything. He doesn't know how many ribs he has. And he doesn't know where mother is. - Shut up, snotty girl! Go to sleep! - I am not snotty! You are! I won. I won. I've told you that you're snotty. We've tricked them! Do you like it? - Who's to blame? - She doesn't ask anyone such a thing. - She doesn't ask me nor you. - But she had a pure life. She hasn't done anything bad. And her sufferances are terrible. - Why? - I think it's because we, the doctors, or the butchers, as we are often called, can't do anything more. I'm not searching for any excuse. That's it. I must go. I don't want that Doina finds me here when she is awake. - She would be angry! - She can't die without admitting that she was wrong, isn't it? But what if everything is just a fake rumour? - A fake rumour?! Who set it? - Anybody could do it. Maybe Iuga did it. It would be surprising that everything should be true. Even her sorrow is a proof of love. Someone must help her to surmount this difficulty. It's better to be close to her now. Come on! Go to her! She needs you. Mitic? is a sort of a knight. He fights for people's joy. - But Serban is somehow noble too. - He is noble, of course. But it doesn't help anyone immediately. He doesn't suffer for her like Mitic? does. Not even now. Please, come later. She is sleeping. I don't want to wake her up. - But Iuga's detached sorrow is... - Serban admires Doina's beauty Like something eternal. The football player is practical. As I was saying, Mitic? is practical. He is happy to lean on a reed. - She is like a "Fata Morgana" for him. - Come on! It's going to rain soon. - I will shoot you, if you don't shut up. - Go on! You may shoot me! Bang! Bang! He bought a cassette recorder for me and Andrei. I have seen him, for the first time, at the seaside, Martha. He thought that I was from Holland. I've told him that he was wrong and that I was working in the lace business. I've also told him that I'm going to leave and I will return for the next summer. He told me that he didn't want me to go. "You are my Dutch girl, isn't it?" That's what he said. And I've told Mitic? that I don't want to cause any trouble in his life. I've told him that I'd be back for the next summer. I've said all those things as if I'd have talked about somebody else, Martha. I would like to leave "incognito". Yes. Just like in a fairy tale. And I'd like to be back when someone would really need me. I want to leave. I want to leave, Martha. And I want to come back when I'm healthy again. I have always liked to read poetry. I may say that's something about a romantic and stupid heroine. She wanted to enjoy everything in her life, unlimited. You know something? There are some interesting lyrics in this book. It's about the will of being equal with everything that's sacred. Every human being is somehow endless. Everybody has the right to live. Every human being has an eternal right on this Earth. Every human being is as divine as his neighbour. - Have you been waiting for me? - Yes.
