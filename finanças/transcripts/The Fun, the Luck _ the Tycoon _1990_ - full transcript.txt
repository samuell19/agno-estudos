Mr. Cheung, do you lose to me on purpose every time? Tycoon, you've improved a lot. Really? Tycoon. Thank you. Tycoon. Tycoon, your grandma is waiting outside. -Is my grandaunt with her? -Yes, sir. Then, let's get moving. Who's throwing things at us? -Look, it's Mr. Lam! -Big Fat, Small Fat! -It's Mr. Lam. -You... Mr. Lam. It's been a while. I've got a 400-year-old cognac. -It's good. -No, I can't. I'm on duty. Come on, just a little sip. I'll look out for you. Look at you. -So good. -I haven't seen you for a while. I... I've been transferred here as a traffic officer. You know you shouldn't be... It'll put me in trouble with the community. Of course! -Come on, just another gulp. -Okay then. -No. -No. -I mean, it's okay. -Come on! -I shouldn't. -What are you afraid of? No, I think this is enough for me! -Come have dinner with me someday. -Okay. -Got to go now. Bye. -Bye. Hey! By the way, I'll be transferred to CID next week. We must plan ahead for the engagement of those two cousins, then only can we head for Turkey. Hey, did Dad write on his will that the wedding is to take place this year? Yes, it has to be this year. If my Po marries your Cindy this year, then there will be no need for us to split the family fortunes. As long as they are the heirs, that will give us a peace of mind. Then, we can travel as much as we want. Indeed. Hey, Singh! -Tycoon Lam, how are you? -How are you? -It's been a while. -It's been a while, sir. As soon as we knew you were coming, we got others to leave just to make room for you. I know. In a moment, we'll hop on a plane, fly to Turkey, -and buy some coffee. -That's right. Young people these days aren't so extravagant. They can make do by dining at home. Grandma, Grandaunt. Grandaunt! Grandma! Po! Po. -Do you like this? -No! -Yes. -This one. How about this one? Here. This one. How about this? -Do you have better ones? -No to all! -Of course. -He said no. -He doesn't like that. -Is there anything prettier? -Let me see it. -Does it suit him? -This is not bad too. -Is there anything else? -It is very nice. -The one beside it is nicer. -Yes. -All right. -Did you call me? -Yes. Paul, since you're a family friend, how much do you charge for this necklace? It's not that expensive. Only three million dollars. How much do you earn each month? -Six thousand dollars? -Around that. That means you'll have to work 40 years for this. Thanks. It'd take 40 years to earn enough to buy this. It's not worth it. -What's the point? -What are you saying? It's an engagement gift for you and Cindy. Keep it. -Fei. -Yes? -Make sure you settle everything tonight. -Yes. As you wish, ma'am. Tycoon, let's go. The roads must be congested now, so we're taking the boat. I see. -Po! -Po! -We're off to the airport! -We're off to the airport! See you at the end of the month! Okay, have fun! See you when you get back. Tycoon, as for tonight, Cindy will be here at 4:00 p.m. And there'll be dinner at dusk. The madams have even picked your outfit. I've got nothing to talk with her. Talk to her about the ski trip when you were kids, when she got hurt and you bandaged her. I suspect that you guys made that story up because there's a variance every time. Regardless of that, when I ring the bell at dinner, that will be the cue for you to present her the necklace which I have in my pocket now. -Fei, come here. -Yes. What's the largest diamond in the world? I know, it's the Australian Miniature. Take another guess. The Teardrop of Africa. -What? -The Teardrop of Africa! Good. How is it different from this one? Exactly! Greetings, Ms. Cindy! Fei, can I not marry her? Only poor men get to choose their wives, Tycoon. Po! Cindy! -Hello. -Hello. This way. -Po. -I hear you. What is it? Do you remember the ski trip where you sprained your ankle? I dropped something. I remember! You patched up my wound, right? When I knew yesterday that I'd be seeing you, I was so excited that I couldn't sleep last night. Really? Am I that exciting to you? Am I better than chicken essence? Tycoon. It's plum blossom. -This is for you. -For me? -Do you know what it's called? -No. -Diamond in a Sandstorm. -Diamond in a Sandstorm? -Yes. -I like it so much! -But it's fake. -I don't believe you. You don't? What's this called? -No idea. -Running Around in Circles! -Running Around in Circles? -Yes. -I like it! -You do? -And what about this? -Don't say it. It's White Dove Diamond. -Yes. -Do you have more? -Bring them here! -Right away. There's more coming up! Like mung bean diamonds. -And this. -Stop it, Po! -Adzuki diamonds. -Cut it out, Po! -They're for me to wear! -Black sand diamonds. -And there's this one. -Stop tossing at me! -Shiny. -Goodness. -Po. -Diamonds. I'm covering my face. Excuse me, I'm going to the washroom. Sure. Do you need to freshen up? -The washroom is over there! -The washroom is over there! You're such a total jerk, Po. I hate you, I curse you! If it weren't for the inheritance, I wouldn't want to see you ever again! Why didn't you just die of pneumonia when you were seven years old? And on that ski trip, instead of nursing your ankle, I should've pushed you down the slope! Once I get you out of my way, I alone will get to keep the inheritance! Sorry to disappoint you! Magdalena, my Goddess of Liberty. Your greatest insult to me is to pair me up with this woman! -Look at you, you ugly hag! -No. -Come here. -Help! You'd even eat shit just for money, wouldn't you? That fortune is mine, you damn jerk! I'm the legal beneficiary! Let's see how you'll fare without my money. Freak, good-for-nothing! -Obnoxious freak! -What happened to you, miss? Tycoon, how could you do that to her? She hit me first! Fei, give me your jacket. -Hurry! -I'm hurrying. Fei, what would happen to me if I become poor? That would be horrible! You'd have no mansion, -no fancy yacht, no cars, -Enough. -Take them all off. -no servants, no one to fence with you, no gorgeous clothes, no fancy food, no fancy shoes, no fancy watches. Tycoon. -You'll lose everything. -I know. Tycoon's watch! Share with me the light of your heart So I too may shine Even in bitter cold, I will walk with you Kindness and compassion shine like the sun My heart is filled with zeal Willing to lift my chest up high Australia? Forget about it! -Canadian real estate is profitable. -Don't migrate if you have no money. -Remember, 1,000 dollars left. -Okay. -So many people there. -Can we see it? It is just like what we have seen. I've collected this privately for over 30 years. Don't complain when there is a good bargain. We're very busy. What are you doing over there? Don't just stand there. Now take these and serve the guests! -Serve the guests? -Rocky. -What do you want? -We need more. -East East Foods. -East East Foods. -Serving the finest. -Serving the finest. -East East. The finest. -East East. The finest. So Mr. Hui, -which girl are you with lately? -Any girl will do. All the girls at the TV station are mine. Aren't you jealous? -Then, are you moving on to the movies? -No way. I'm telling you, movie girls are ruthless. I don't mean to frighten you, but this is a huge undertaking. Hey, stop right there. Do you know who's pulling the strings? It's none other than Lam Po Sang, the richest man in Hong Kong. Not only can he build an airport, he can even build a space station! -Of course. -Of course. Don't you think he looks like Mr. Lam? -You're right. -A little bit. So what if he does? A lot of people in Hong Kong look like me, but are they as rich as I am? -Good point. -Good point. Okay, you may go now. Go serve the others. Excuse me, would you like a drink? Of course. How is it? Do I look tense? No, not really. -Thank you. -You are welcome. Do your job! Leung Yuk. When your speech is up, it's okay if you miss out a few words. But remember the name of our company, East East Foods, the phone number, and address. -That's for our dignitaries to hear-- -Okay, stop nagging. -I was just reminding you. -Otherwise, I'll forget everything. Take it easy, I'll be cheering for you. They're all my good friends. -No one will hiss or boo at you. -Nothing to be nervous about. Okay. -Phone number and address-- -Please donate. Sir, please donate. Thank you. Donating money is so yesterday. I'll give you something different. I'll announce it later. Mr. Chiu is a dignitary. Of course he'll offer something special. That was a spectacular, eye-opening performance. Like they always say, there's always a way out, even from the deepest depths of despair. We would like to thank you for your generosity today. And we'd like to especially thank East East Foods for providing refreshments this evening. We'd like to invite the representative of East East Foods to give us a few words. Please, Ms. Hung. -Help me out here. -Right. -There's a speech. -Hello. Hello, everyone. -Hello. -Hello. Hello, everyone. Remember to mention East East Foods. Hello, everyone. On behalf of the organizers, I would like to thank you all for your participation in tonight's Donation Party for Handicapped Children. All the special ones who have performed for us tonight -hope that they managed -East East Foods' address and number. to warm your hearts with their heartfelt performances, so that you'll generously donate to help a lot of these lovely children. -East East... -It's East East... Foods. East East Foods has taken the initiative to sponsor tonight's event by providing free meals to all. -There are a lot of children -Please donate. with disabilities waiting for you to lend a hand. -So if you could all donate... -Hey! Even if it's just a little... Let's make it a night. If you're okay with it, I'll get you a gold or silver locket. Even if it's just a little... How about a Rolex? -Good. -Hey. Even if it's just a little... Or how about both? You'll be helping a lot of folks out there. Thank you. Have some of my donations! Here's more... I want to pledge. Bring me a cake! -Throw at him! -Yes, throw at him! -Throw at him! -Yes, throw at him! Don't let him get away. Cake-throwing is so yesterday... If I had known there'd be cake-throwing, I wouldn't have them made so nicely. Bring it on! I've pledged! -Take this! -Just throw at me! Ms. Hung, we'd like to thank you for the good work tonight. -My pleasure. Call me anytime, okay? -Goodbye. -Bye. -Help me throw him into the trunk. We'll take care of him once he gets up. -He drank up all my booze. -What's up? I'll get him when he's awake! Tung Tung. Everything's in. Move it. Hey! Hey, you missed a tray! Hey! Don't go! Hey! Hey! -What? -What? -What the hell? -What? Don't you know the rules? You should get back by the same vehicle you came in. -I came on my own. -Then, go home on your own! -On his own? He drank too much! -On his own? He drank too much! I know! I'll make his life miserable by cutting his pay once he gets sober. -You haven't gotten paid, right? -Excuse me? -Sign here. -Hey, Leung Yuk. This chum looks fishy. Make sure he's not getting paid twice. -Over here? -Listen up. Anyone who thinks they can outwit Hung Tung Tung is going to have a lot of work cut out. -Over here? -Yes. -Here, 250 dollars. -Give it to me! Of course, you're being paid 250 dollars, but that doesn't include transportation. Now I'm giving you a lift to the city. It'd cost more to take a taxi, right? -Tung Tung. -Enough. Everyone has to follow the rules. It's rules that make the world go round. You didn't stick to the rules either. You made me mix the cocktails. I didn't ask you to steal my booze! -Hey, don't you dare throw up in my van! -Hey! He's going to puke! -He puked! -Keep an eye on him! Let go. -Let go, or I'll hit you! -I will hit you too! -I said let go! -I'll hit you now! I'm not afraid! Why did you stop so suddenly? We're here. Goodbye, everyone. Sir, I saw you stretching your hands from a distance. I thought you did it just for fun. Where to? Hey, tell me where you're going. I'm trying to work here. I serve all sorts of people with all sorts of destinations in mind. When foreigners get on my cab and ask to go to the Hong Kong Hotel, they'd say, "Hong Kong Hotel, thank you." If they were Japanese, they'd go, "Hong Kong Hotel, please." And if they were Taiwanese or from the Mainland China, they'd call me, "Comrade!" "Comrade, Hong Kong Hotel, please." I also have my own objective in this line of work. That is to own this cab once I've paid up all the installments. Then I can drive it myself or rent it out to someone. You should've been prepared before hopping on. So where are you off to? -East East. -East East. I don't know the place. -Good morning. -Good morning. Good morning. -East East opens the earliest -East East opens the earliest -Just for you, we do our best -Just for you, we do our best -Tasty food served with a smile -Tasty food served with a smile -East East awaits you -East East awaits me? Good morning, everyone. Now get to work! Good morning, neighbors. Please come in. Good morning, students. Please come in. You were all beat. Didn't you get enough sleep? Or is it Remembrance Day today, so you had to sing an elegy? You four bastards ruined my jingle! You're the lamest in all of Asia. -Working hard for our goals -Working hard for our goals -Keep it up, don't give up -Keep it up, don't give up -Making our dreams come true -Making our dreams come true -By working together -By working together -Off to work. -Off to work. -Good morning. -Good morning. Food will be ready in ten minutes. HIRING A STAFF FOOD, ACCOMMODATION INCLUDED I'm here for a job. Well, you should see my brother about that. -He's in there? -Yes. Thanks. What a strong current! It feels great! Good! This current is just right for me, doctor. It feels so great! Let's get down to business. Of course I can hire you for 2,500 dollars a month. That was great! Accommodation and food are included. That was great! If you want to quit, you have to give me a notice three months before you quit. -All right. -That's great. This is terrific, doctor. Great job! Now listen up. Do you have an identification card? It's okay. Turn it down, doctor. Never mind! It's okay if you don't have one, but you'll only get 1,500 dollars. It feels so nice. When can you start work? Right now. Good! You are one promising... ordinary young man. Come on. Mr. Hung, you haven't fully recovered. You need a little more rest, or your arm will keep twitching. There isn't anything special about being a busboy. You just have to do some light work. Even so, there are basic rules that you need to follow. Wipe the floor when it's dirty. Clean the windows when there are stains. And clear the table as soon as the customers leave. -Leave no rubbish behind. -I don't want it! How about a drink? Restrooms must be cleaned three times a day. -The floor... -I don't want it! Thank you. I wasn't even talking about you. -I swear, if I ever did, I'd get smacked-- -Remember... You were just careless. No need to cry. -The image... -Just a train ticket for 20 dollars and prepare another few hundred -to have it aborted in Shenzhen. -Tasty Tasty, delicious, spotless, squeaky clean And there's one more basic rule you have to follow. I expect all workers to pay special attention to it and understand in depth what it really means. -Thank you so much. -If any section needs your help... -You were great. -Thanks. -If any section needs your help-- -Thank you. -If any section-- -Damn you! If any section needs your help, you must give them your utmost support! First, behold our perfect setup. Yes, sir. We're an efficient company with a sanitary system, and the best kitchen equipment. So we always ensure we serve the freshest, and ensure we're state of the art. Where's Rocky? -Rocky! -Shut up! I told you many times to change the fuse, but did you ever listen? How dare you be rude to your elders? -What an insolent twerp. Out of my way! -Gosh. You stubby brat! If you weren't my grandaunt's third older cousin's-- -Nephew, right? -Yes, I wouldn't have provided for you. Look, just because you know how to fix pipes and electricity, -doesn't mean you can-- -Get fresh with you? -You-- -Tung Tung! -I have good news to tell you. -I've got to take care of that twerp. Last night at the charity function, someone donated a necklace -worth two million dollars. -That must be Mr. Chiu! No wonder he was talking about giving a special gift. -How do you know it was him? -Of course I do. I've been mingling with the rich and famous. People like Mr. Chiu, the richer, the taller. The taller, the slimmer. The slimmer, the humbler. -You have to pull the door. -I know. So I'm really sure it's him. Hi, I'm Po. -I'm Heung Tung. -I'm Heung Nam. -I'm Heung Sai. -I'm Heung Pak. -Tung, Nam, Sai, Pak. -What are you? A busboy, of course. And you? -He's a busboy just like you! -A busboy just like you! Not for long, kids! Are you blind? Be careful. It's okay. Is it her? Move it! -Mr. Hung. -Are you mocking me? Are you teasing me? -No, sir. -Are you making fun of me? No. If you ever own an organization as well-established as East East Foods, you may at any time... As you please. Back to work! Working hard every day for my ambitions Keep it on, don't give up Making our dreams come true By working together You do it. By working together By working together By working together -I'm here to take out the trash. -Sure. I'm leaving. My name is Po, the busboy. Thanks. No problem. You know, you were so nervous that night. -I was. -I didn't expect... you would splat a cake on him! -I didn't expect to do that. -I knew you'd say that. If you'll excuse me. Hey. Here's your 50 dollars. -No, it's fine. -Take it. -It's fine. -It's yours to begin with. Here. Just take it. Don't let my brother find out. Thanks. With so many dreams -One must overcome many obstacles -One must overcome many obstacles It's not cold. I don't need another blanket. I can eat whatever I want here. I'm trying to save, so I won't spend. I can get food from them, that's all. Don't worry! Give me a break. Yes, I brush my teeth every night! Can I speak to her? Hello, ma'am. I'm his colleague.

Tonight, we'll have to work a graveyard shift. No one gets to sleep. Do you hear me? Yes, that is good. -Are you kidding me? -Are you kidding me? Don't you have to work? Okay, everyone plays a part, -and that includes you. -Me? -How about that? -Great! Okay! Life is short, so let's get on with it. -Okay! -Okay! We can't make it through without a good amount of booze. Here you go, pals! Since the world is becoming democratic, I'll just stick to popular opinion. You better cheer up on me after your drink because none of you are going to bed! Bottoms up! -Cheers! -Cheers! What the hell? What a brilliant trick. You used alcohol to fool me. Look. Nothing's wrong. It can't be. It can't be. Let's wrap the wontons. What are you doing? Making wonton dough. We've got this. Finally, I'm sober at last. Gosh, time flies! What? 6:00 a.m.? Are you kidding me? Wake up! -You drunkards! -What happened? You're underage and you're drinking? Damn you! -Hurry up! -Quick, stay out of my way! Don't push me! Stop pushing! -You brat! -That's a lot. -My God, is this a dream? -Can I eat this? -Are they real? -Are these all real? -It smells good! -It's real. -Try it. -This cake is good! Who made these? Thank God! It smells good, tastes good, and it's crispy. Good morning! How well did I do? -It can't be! -It's all well done How did you two pull it off? -Say for yourself -Say for yourself The front seat looks good. If you're sitting in front, you have to watch the food. -Make sure they don't drop off. -All right. Let the kid squeeze into the van. Listen to me. Squeeze in. -I can't squeeze in. -You can't? Of course you can. Push harder. -It's no use! -Harder! Just cooperate. -That won't do either! -Just bear with it. Can't you just squeeze in? Damn! There you go! Like they always say, "Stop complaining and push harder!" Hey, heads up. All right, take good care of these. You know what you're here for. And just a little more. Move it! Take care of yourselves and the food! Aren't you folks lucky to avoid having to squeeze in? Taxi! Push harder, my foot! Are you okay? I'm doing fine. I'm happy, it's comfortable. -Is this your first job? -Yes. -Have you gone to school? -Yes. I was going to go to Cambridge. But they said it's foggy there and I could get rheumatism. So, I ended up in Harvard. After a while, I got bored with the place. So, I went to Yale. That's all. Aren't you stretching it a little too far? What did you say? Why are we stopping? We're here. It's just two streets down. Really? The building's so tall! -Get down. -Okay. "Lam Po Sang Enterprise Building"? Lam Po Sang? Hey, get down! Are you daydreaming of being a tycoon? Everyone, get down! Once you park the van, -get back here at once! -Help me out! Step on it! Can't you see you've ruined the company's reputation? Welcome. Welcome. What is this? Welcome. Welcome.

Squeaky clean. Leung Yuk won't be back so soon. There's no use waiting up there. So do what you've got to do and get her! -What a precocious kid you are. -He is right. -Rocky is smart. -Look! I bought you two tickets, so you can ask her out. Ask her out to our competition. Don't worry. I have your back. -These are mine, right? -Give them to me. But they gave me those! How am I going to explain to my girl tomorrow? -Say what? -Give them back to me! -No! -You're so mean! -Give it to me! -Rocky, aren't you our manager? -You don't need tickets! -You don't need tickets! -You're right. -Silly! It's the boss' van. -Get to bed! -Go! -What's going on? -Let's sleep! -Turn off the lights! -Hurry! Why didn't you get changed before going to bed? Don't take it off. Leung Yuk, thanks. Fei, what are you doing here? I'm happy working here. They're all very nice to me. I can't work if you hang around here all the time. I brought you some soup. But we already got soups here. That's just MSG you have there. I brought you the real deal. I can't talk to you now, I've got work. Now go. It's fine. That's my job. -I'm fine. -Allow me. There are so many things to do when the four of them are not around. How about we go see them in competition tonight? -Sure. -Miss. -Could you come over here? -Allow me. It's okay. I'll go. -What can I do for you? -What's today's special? -Wonton, of course. -Wonton? -Would you like some? -Have you dated before? Do you plan to have a baby once you get married? Once you have a baby, you shouldn't be working anymore. Be a good wife and mom. What's your birth date and sign? -What are you talking about, sir? -Nothing! Sir. If you have nothing to do, let me take you to the counter. I'll ask her those things myself, if you don't mind. Welcome. Leung Yuk. I've got two tickets for tonight's singing competition at the disco. Do you want to come? Sure. This room is reserved for VIPs like me only. -Really? -Like they say, money makes your world go round. Of course. You never dreamed you could set foot in a place like this, right? -I don't dream. -You're right. One must never daydream. It'll ruin your self-esteem to keep comparing yourself with others, right? Yes. It's been a while since I last came to a place like this. If you like it, I'll bring you here more often. To be honest to you, before my wife passed away, she and I would party almost every night. You can party again if you marry again. That's why I call you a heartless twit! Nowadays, I only get to come here once in a while. But my heart still yearns for her so dearly, you know? I was feeling fine just now, but now you broke my heart. What that monk said was absolutely right. -What? -What? Since I'm in a good mood tonight, I'll tell you a secret. If you're really in love with a woman, light up three incense sticks at 9:00 p.m. during the Winter Festival. You're too young for this! Then, look at her in the face and kiss her. And she'll never part with you forever. Until death do you part. I'm an example. Even now, I still love her! It is true. Bravo! Bravo! With so many dreams One must overcome many obstacles Bravo! I have to hide my intense feelings Wow, they're so cool! Keep your voice down, or they'll see your braces. I can't help it. You shouldn't have come dressing like this. The doctor says that I have astigmatism. I also need to put on braces for my protruding teeth. I haven't seen you for a week. I miss you so. Stop pouting. I said stop pouting. Stop pouting or I'll leave! You're embarrassing me. Now, stop crying or I'll leave! Hey. Hey. Hey! What are you doing? I was just kidding. I'm going to the restroom. Why didn't you say so? It's over there! Those four monkeys are doing pretty good. I think they're doing great up there. -They could win this. -One will win if they work hard. Silly. They'll only have a chance if they convince the judges. What's the point of buying votes? This is what I call rapport. Do you want them to remain busboys forever? If you'll excuse me. Mr. Chiu is right, but they're not so bad. Hey, now's the time! Facing so many failed attempts Let's have a drink. -Sure. -What if you get drunk? I'll drink for you. Bottoms up. The past is akin to an invisible hand I want you to reach above the sky Writing poems in cold words Never give up in singing this song out I want you to reach above the sky -Hey, pass it to me! -Hey, pass it to me! -Come, bring it on! -It's mine! -Over here! -Go. -Give back to me! -Hey! -Come with me. -Come here. -I just want to have a look. -Hey! -Over here! -What's going on? -I'm coming! -Please get in the car. To celebrate your success, I'll treat you to supper, all expenses paid! Get on! -Get on! -Let's get on! Hey! Hey! -Hands up! -Get him! What else do you have? Take them out! -What the hell are you doing? -Why did you... I got you! Four of you! You get him! Don't you know the law? You roughed up my girlfriend! -What's this? -Pepper spray. No! Where are my glasses and braces? You're pretty without them. This is for hitting my girl! Pervert! How dare you? I'm going to kill you! -Fei, think of something! -Take this antenna. Leung Yuk! I'm coming! Tung Tung. CONSTRUCTION I hate it when someone aims at my head. I didn't shoot. I'm fine. -You, go get him. -Okay. There you are, you freak. I've been looking for you! On your knees! I'm switching to the Immigration Department next month. Are you okay? I'm fine. Can you please lower the gun? -It's loaded! -Hurry. -Just drop the gun! -Freeze! Don't move. Let's help them out! -Get him! -Let him die! Stop hitting him! -You're in big trouble now. -My goodness. -He is from the CID! -He is from the CID! -What, the CID? -What, the CID? -This is my warrant! -You group of idiots. Big Fat, are you okay? -Who hit him? -Not me! Call the ambulance now. Let me help you. This is so enjoyable. Doctor, please take good care of Mr. Chiu. Did you get hurt? I'm fine. Take good care of this one as well, doctor. He was the hero who fought many people on his own. How brave. You certainly deserve this reward. -Thank you, Mr. Hung. -You are welcome. Ready? Such massive current! I'm treating you three at once. Let him try it. He probably never tried this before. I have. Yes, it's the latest trend. How long have you been here? About a month. So you're from Mainland China, trying to taste some goose. You don't have a Hong Kong ID. And you're after someone with a Canadian passport? I feel fantastic because my sister is going to have a bright future. If she marries Mr. Chiu, she'll become a Canadian citizen. After that, of course she'll apply for citizenship on my behalf. So who cares if I don't get a British passport or if Hong Kong sinks? Have you discussed this with those involved? I'm the one involved! -Did she even approve? -This is a family affair. You stay out of this! This is the last one! Heung Dong, Heung Nam, Heung Sai, Heung Pak. -Sign here. -Okay. -Hurry, sign here. -This is mine. -Ma Yu Fei. -Here. -Lam Po Po. -Yes. Thanks. The sum is good. -Thanks. -Thanks. Where? Are you free tomorrow? -Why? -Let's go for dinner. Are you asking me out for dinner? -Where? -My place. Your place? All right, what time? Seven o'clock. Sure. Tycoon. Fei, what are you doing here? The old ladies will be home soon. You can't be here anymore. Let's go home. Look, I just got paid. Really? Fei, is it true that only ordinary people get to choose their wives? Yes. You know, she asked me over for dinner tonight. -Really? -Yes! And could you please stop following me around? -Kwai, send him home. -Yes, sir. Tycoon, don't forget to bring her a gift -when you go there. -Of course! -Don't let him wander! -Yes, sir! -I'm coming! -I'm coming! I'm going to buy some lychees -Are you expecting someone? -Are you expecting someone? I asked Po over for dinner. -We have to thank him for saving us. -What is so great about him? -What's the big deal? -Ms. Hung. This is for you. Aren't you a bit too old, sir? Hey, don't do that to him! Sir, you're not old at all. I thank you on my sister's behalf. How could you turn down such a nice gift? Don't you have any courtesy? This must have cost a fortune! -Mr. Chiu. What a pleasant surprise. -It's you. -Come on in, make yourself at home. -Hey. You rich people certainly have style. You send the gift before you arrive. And it's priceless! -You shouldn't have spent so much on this. -It's nothing. Come on in. Make yourself at home. My sister is in the kitchen. I'll get you some tea. I'll get the door. -Take a seat. -Mr. Hung! You have the gall to show yourself in our place, don't you? There's some work to do in the kitchen, I could use your help. You're most suited for the job. Come on in. -Tung Tung, he's my guest. -I'll take care of him! Now, help me marinate the pork. -Get in there. -Tung Tung, he's our guest. Our guest is over there! Mr. Chiu, Leung Yuk is here. Don't just stand there. Get into the kitchen! Leung Yuk, we've known each other for five years. So are you ready to be my bride? This is the best part, so stay out of it. Now, go chop the ginger. I'm not ready. I know you're not. That's why I want to talk about it. My mom doesn't like you working at a fast food joint, and show yourself all day. She'd like you to work at a fine dining restaurant. You know my folks want their daughter-in-law to be respectable and also presentable. Let's get engaged first. Then, I'll open a fine dining restaurant for you to work at. Mr. Chiu, we haven't known each other well enough. Po, let's go eat outside tonight. Wait, there must have been a misunderstanding. Hang on! -Leung Yuk. -Stop bugging me. You and Chiu have enough food to chow down until midnight. -Bye. -Hey! There is so much food, we can't finish them. Where's my umbrella? -My goodness, it's pouring outside. -Where is it? Why you wretched... Hey. Ready? Let's go! -Let's eat. -What would you like? -How about corn? -Sure. Here. What a beautiful world. Of course, the air is the freshest this time of the year. The air is much fresher in the countryside. -You lived in the countryside? -I used to live there. I guess I'd like to live in the countryside. Look at those ships. The one on the left is Po Cheung. The one on the right is Po Wah. The one in the middle is Po Kwong. The furthest behind is Po San, and there's also Po Po! You can see so far off? Not really. They are my-- My dreams. I wish I could cruise around the world on one of them. Then, why are you working at East East Foods? What's that to do with your dreams? I think people should learn to adapt to various environments. Of course, I see that you enjoy your work. But you don't get paid much when you're working at East East Foods. Money is not a problem for me. What matters to me is trying out each trade. There's something to learn in each trade. There are mountains, there are seas What have you learned at East East Foods? Don't mind me for being honest. Your brother, for example, may be shrewd, but he built his business from scratch. And Rocky may be a kid, but he sure knows how to make a living. Not to mention the four stooges. Although they've toiled at work, but they've held on to their dreams. Those are lessons worth learning. And you... You could have married a rich man for money, yet you didn't. There's more. I've learned that the wonton dough here is ready-made! -Do you want to hear more? -No, thank you. The wind is strong now. Hey, not this again! Stop! It's driving me nuts! I'm angry now! My umbrella's getting blown inside out! My goodness. Give me a break! Awesome. Sorry about the dinner. It's okay. I'm off tomorrow. I'll make you a nice one at the quarters. -Really? -I'm quite a good chef, you know. -Sure. Bye. -Bye. Hey, Leung Yuk! What is it? See you at the quarters tomorrow. Don't let Tung Tung find out. -Good night. -Good night. "See you at the quarters tomorrow." A nice dinner? -What are you looking at? -What are you looking at? CLOSED FOR ONE DAY FOR WINTER SOLSTICE FESTIVAL Come on. Why do we have to be so sneaky? It's my birthday today. But you celebrated your birthday on Easter. I even sent you a tie. Why are you celebrating it again? Based on the lunar calendar. Then, why is it so far off? So what's your birthday wish? -I could use a kiss. -Sure. Wait. What? Let's get something to eat. -What are you doing? -Pretending it's a candle. Come on in. I have the key. Damn, guests aren't allowed here. -You have to hide. -Okay. Where are you going? Over here! Silly. Where is everyone? They must have all gone home. I'll go get the chairs. Aren't you going home? I will! I have to go home someday. It's so far away. It's by the sea. Not easy to get there. And my folks aren't easy to deal with. They never wanted me to leave them. They hated it when I moved to the city. Maybe I'll take you home someday. Sure. When you're free, you can ask your folks to drop by East East Foods. That would be a surprise for them. Have a drink. -Can you do me a favor? -What? Close your eyes. -Do I have to close my eyes? -Yes. You have to. Okay. No peeking. Leung Yuk! Leung Yuk, where are you? Leung Yuk! -Tung Tung. -You scared me! You know, today's Winter Solstice and it's almost 9:00 p.m. You've got to come home for dinner. -I don't want you to hang around here. -All right. -I will go home now. -Sure. Leung Yuk? Po. I'm sorry. I was too rash last time. So, I'm here to offer you an apology. Wine. How fitting. Shall we drink and forget what happened? Bottoms up. What's so funny? -Is this your girlfriend? -No! -But you'd still be in trouble. -Goodness! Hide her quick! Don't panic. I said, don't panic! Po! Hurry! What's that? -What's what? -Leung Yuk! Leung Yuk! Over here! Where did she disappear to again? Where could she go? Open up. Three incense sticks? It's 9:00 p.m. on Winter Solstice. Something's up. I'm going to sit here and find out what happens. Who's that? -So heavy. I can't hold it anymore. -Let me help you. It's moving by itself! Police! -Police! -What's going on? -What's going on? -The police are after us. -Hide under the table! -Hurry! Why aren't you hiding? -Why should I? -You're illegal! Hurry! -Get down! -What? Just crouch and bend! -Sir. -I'm from the Immigration Department. This is my search warrant. We smell the presence of illegal immigrants here. They won't get away from me. We don't have any illegals here. Since you have a search warrant, I'll cooperate with you. Take your time. Why don't you look under the table? Looks like it could fit dozens of people. Officer! Do I need your guidance? I'm not searching here! I'm sure you're hiding something when you're sitting there. They must be hiding there. Hey, go search at the back! There's nothing here. Is this some kind of trick? -I... -What? You... Did you find anything? It's okay when you've bothered a taxpayer like me. But it's a shame that you've wasted government funds here. Bye. This is ridiculous. Let's go! So, is it over? No point dropping by again, officer. Seriously? That was weird. That's weird. They were all under the table, but you can't find them? That's weird. Too weird. The worst has come and gone. Come out, everyone! Why were there so many of you hiding there? And you, what are you doing here? How did you get here? Here they come again! Give me a spot. -Hey, watch it! -You're hitting me! -Get out! -But I came here first! -I... -You don't have to be here! You're right. I don't have to be here. I'll get the door, Leung Yuk. -There you go. -There you go. What is it this time, officer? Nothing. Personal matters. -Can I use your restroom? -Over there. Boy, I got to go now. -Hey! -What? That's enough! I hate mice! Help! So you've been wearing a fake mustache all along. What are you doing here? What are you doing here? -What are you doing here? -What are you doing here? What are you doing here? Why are there so many people here? There he is. The illegal immigrant! -Why don't you ask him for his ID? -What ID? You're kidding. -Cuckoo? -Cuckoo? It's already 9:00 p.m. I have to kiss her. Hey! Something's up, all right! -Cuckoo! -Cuckoo! Hey, wait up! That monk was right. Wait! What are you doing here? Don't lay a finger on her, or I'll kill you! Come back here! Po! Don't push me! How dare you hit me? Hey! Stop dragging me! I want to see what's going on! Let go of me! Perfect! Enough. I still don't know your name. I'm Sin. -I'm Jim. -So good. Yes, sure! No problem! Thank you. Everything seems to be getting better after my makeover. East East Foods is so fabulous Like it never was before This jingle is the best I'm sorry, loving couple. We're closed today. Are you kidding me? -Boss, why are we closed today? -Boss, why are we closed today? Can we clean up? Guys, don't panic. Someone offered us 200,000 dollars-- Come on! I'm sorry, we're closed for the day. We're here to decorate for tonight's banquet. Excuse me, pals. -What is it? -That was close! May I ask who hired you to do all this? I have no idea! Where's the restroom? Mr. Hung, may I ask who booked the entire restaurant? All I know is that he's a huge business mogul. He wants to keep his identity a secret from ordinary folks like you. All right. Back to work! We were away for barely a month, and this is what you did to my son? Fei, you've gone too far. -Lock him up! -Yes, ma'am. That's neat! Over there! There it is! You monkeys are asking for it this time! -What's going on? -Nothing! Back to work! What is it? -Look, it's so beautiful! -What's there? It's a Jaguar! -Wait up! -Wait up! -It's a Rolls Royce! -It's a Rolls Royce! So many dignitaries today. Welcome! What should I do now? This isn't so brilliant. Why are they having a ball in a place like this? Beats me. I'm getting back to work. Thanks. -Yes. -Okay. Please have some. Please have some. Mr. Lam! It's Director Lam! -Tycoon! -Tycoon? Madams! We have work to do, let's continue later. We gather here tonight to announce that my granddaughter, Chan Yuk Sin... Will be engaged to my grandson, Lam Po Sang. -Mr. Cheung, go ahead. -All right. Presenting Ms. Chan Yuk Sin! And Mr. Lam Po Sang! -What? -What? Grandma. Grandaunt. Let's not waste any more time and proceed with it. The engagement ceremony begins now! -Objection! -Objection overruled. As they said, objection overruled. This is neither our courtyard nor a courthouse. I have nothing to do with this engagement. But I do. If you're not marrying me, I'll inherit everything there is. Tycoon, at the behest of both madams, whichever side declines the marriage will also forfeit their rights to inheritance to the other party. Good, that's a good idea! Since you can place an order anytime, I'd like to make the first order in all my life. Folks, it's true that I'm about to be engaged tonight, but not to her. It's Leung Yuk. -Leung Yuk? -Leung Yuk? Is she here? -Who is Leung Yuk? -Who is Leung Yuk? -There she is. Hung Leung Yuk. -My sister? You mean, my dear sister? -Good. -Good. You're so lucky to have... Leung Yuk! Miss! Hey! Tycoon, don't just stand there. Go after her! Now, the fortune's all yours. -Leung Yuk! -Go! Fei, what happened to you? -After her, now! -Leung Yuk! Leung Yuk, wait for me! -What do we do now? -Hurry, after them! -After them! -After them! My grandmother-in-law! -In-law, let's go! -Hurry, watch your steps. -Over there. Hurry. -Hurry. -Hurry! -Hurry! -Step aside! -You step aside! -Hurry! -Hurry! I don't want to rush you, but we've got to hurry. -Hurry up. -Step on it! Hurry! Hurry! -Come on. -Come on. Watch your steps. We'll catch up with them. Hey, my car! You should've waited for our future in-laws! -Gosh. -Hop on! Hurry. Hop on! Leung Yuk! Please stop! Could you please pull over? I want to talk to you! -Hurry! -Hurry! Hey, you're a fast one. My dear in-laws, I knew there was something in Po when I first met him. He now likes Leung Yuk. -That means there is something in her. -Yes. I also knew there was something in him when he first got on my cab. Looks like he's still aimless as he was! You know Mr. Lam, the tycoon? He's from the upper rungs of society. -I took him in once. -You're a crazy one. I don't mind because I'm young. But you've got to watch out for the old ladies behind. In-laws, are you all right? -We're fine. -We're okay. -Faster! -Sure! -Faster, they said! -By the way, what's your name, sir? -They call me Stink. -Stink, it is. -Step on it! -Faster! -Hurry! -Hurry! -Catch them! -Why are you so slow? Rocky, help me out here! Tell Leung Yuk for me that I've lost all my money once I left the mansion! -What did he say? -I only picked up "money." -He said he has lots of money! -He said he has lots of money! What does that have to do with me? -What did she say? -I think I heard "degree." -She asked you to get a degree first! -She asked you to get a degree first! A degree? But I got my Ph.D. in the UK since a long time ago! -What did he say now? -I think I heard "cheese." -He likes to have cheese for breakfast! -He likes to have cheese for breakfast! -Faster. -Faster. -Why did you have to stop? -Hurry! I am glad my sister didn't have to marry him! What are they doing? -Do you know him? -That bastard? Not at all! It's not that I don't want him, but Po doesn't want me. Stop the van! That was close, Leung Yuk. Now, if only you'd listen to me. Leung Yuk! Leung Yuk! We're coming to help you! -Hurry. -Hurry. -Don't go over there! -Excuse me. Where are they? No, not now. Everyone, stop! Please, listen to me! Could you please back up? When they call for help, you got to show them some solidarity! Follow my lead. Even if you don't believe me, I'll have to explain it! I didn't choose to be born wealthy. It was fate that brought me to East East Foods. Knowing you is the best thing that happened to me. There's nothing wrong about us liking each other! If I marry you, I'll be an ordinary person. This ring costs 700 dollars, it's a fake. But it's the first thing that I bought with my own money. If you're not happy with it, I'll work harder to earn more, so that I'll buy you a real one. If you don't like it, I'll throw it away! -Why did you do that? -Miss! Come up here if you need any help. God is there for you. Look at them. Go up. I wouldn't have thrown it away. Hey, where did they go? They were here just minutes ago. Over there! Hey! Hey! Goodbye, everyone! -Farewell! Take care! -Bye! Hey, don't go anywhere! It's not over yet! It's not over when the screen freezes. I've got a few loose ends to tie. Mr. Chiu is so lucky. Cindy married him. She proved to be very proliferating. The first year, she had twins and the next, triplets! Eventually, she had eight kids in no more than three years. So much that she received a warning from the Family Counseling Center. As for the brothers, Heung Tung, Heung Nam, Heung Sai, and Heung Pak, they have sung their way to stardom! Now they're the top band in Hong Kong. They got themselves a French-like name, which sounds like "Beyond." BEYOND'S "REAL WITNESS" CONCERT What about Rocky Ma Yu Fei? He's not doing too badly. He became a child star and earned a Golden Horse nomination. But he lost. Never mind, he won Best Supporting Actor in the Asian Film Festival. He took on a stage name, Wong Kwan Yuen. Which sounds ridiculous. "Working hard without complaining for the sake of the people." I can't believe the shrewd Hung Tung Tung would finally turn over a new leaf to serve the populace. So he went on to vie for a seat in legislation with the slogan, "It's okay if you hate me, but if you give me a vote, your breakfast is on me! VOTE FOR HUNG TUNG TUNG And now for my godbrother, Lam Po Sang and Hung Leung Yuk, no one knows where they are, but I've heard some rumors. One day on Winter Solstice, someone spotted them shopping for roast pork in Fa Yuen Street Market. They were very much in love. As for me, Stink, I'm now their godson, living in a mansion like a king! Ever since I moved in, I could hardly go out. Farewell! Subtitle translation by CL Tan
