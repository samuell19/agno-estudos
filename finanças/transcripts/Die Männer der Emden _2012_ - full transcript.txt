On the eve of the First World War German Empire expansionist foreign policy calls for the creation of strategically important military bases world-wide, as a display of strength including at Tsingtau in north China where a German town is created in a Chinese setting. Here lies the German light cruiser SMS Emden. Many German servicemen are stationed in Tsingtau. Far from home, they are having a good time. Nobody expects war. As an Imperial Navy Kapitaenleutnant I should be looking forward to special leave. Finally able to relax after six months of incredible hardship. But I am unable to do so. The steady staccato of the train sudden calm and the always recurring awful images. It all adds to my doubts and questions about overconfidence, pride or about what I can least forgive myself for blindly following orders. It all began so peacefully and in the best of spirits. Men It's been a tough week and you have earned your run ashore. But before that there is still work to do, the coaling supervised by Leutnants von Schulau and Overbeck. Also I want to remind you about Sunday's sports day. We do not want to give a bad impression to our English and French shipmates. So, do not get too blitzed on Saturday night. The sports contest should take place on the sports field, and not in the pub. I think we understand each other in this respect. Have a good weekend. Tsingtau, main base of the German colony in China. Permanently based here our pride and joy His Majesty's Ship Emden. Neither of my officers had volunteered for the watch, understandably as this dusty and filthy duty was not popular. Anyway I like the man. Bugger, what time have you got? Blimey Karl, treat the East Asia Squadron as a holiday. Peaceful Tsingtau everything quiet in China. Oh. - Friedrich. Well well well. Your getting your hopes up there. She gave you the brush off twice. All good things come in threes. TSINGTAU German Club Have you decided what to wear tonight? I'm not in the mood. - Then I fear you won't be in demand. Mama and Papa want you to be at your best in company. The world is small, especially in Tsingtau. So if he does not come soon we order. I wonder ... What I find in him, I know. You won't be so stuck up soon. The world is small? No the world is huge. So big that it keeps rolling along as in the past. Believe me new times are coming. Could it be my sister secretly reads communists? You just need to open your eyes. Things can't go on as in the last century I promise you. Good day ladies. May I? - Please. Menu. Menu. Can I buy you lunch? That would be our pleasure Herr von Schulau. Hee hee, hee hee. Actually I have arranged to meet with Leutnant Overbeck. Do you have any idea where he might be? Coaling is taking longer than expected. Difficulties with the coolies. Always the same. But maybe a glass of champagne to raise the spirits. Love to. - No. Over this weekend, which was to go down in history a lot was going on. A get-together of German and English ships' companies at the time an increasingly common event especially in Chinese Tsingtau made a German brewer richer. Hey Mahnert, whoever sings German must also eat German. Yes children's blood is off. Norget, cut the crap. Here Mahnert tasty food ... Hey! What's up Norget, I thought German food should be eaten hot. Hilgert shut your gob. Unbelievable, officers have money for that. For that they left us in peace today. The officers were invited to a German English wedding. My friend William was marrying the daughter of a German industrialist. Nearby Tsingtau beach has a striking resemblance to our own country of Germany and also the nocturnal carrying-ons of a mild summer night are very similar, and don?t exclude our officers. For ever and eternity. For ever that I can promise you. As for eternity however I have no idea what happens. Maybe there I'll become a stranger again. Ha ha, you dare. Unintelligible whispering Apologies, I was not feeling too good. But I'm better again. Pleased to hear it. The bathroom is not that beautiful for you to stay there so long. And funny how our little Herr Leutnant ... And consider being mature for once. Cut out the whispering you two. Something is in the wind. Unintelligible whispering Can I ask the ladies and gentlemen for a moment's silence. The captain of the Emden Kapitaen von Mueller has an important announcement to make. Ladies and gentlemen. We have just received an important message. His Majesty the Kaiser has ordered the mobilisation of the entire Navy and Army. Following the crossing of the German border by Russian troops the Reich finds itself in a state of war. The Reich has today at 1900 hours German time declared war on Russia. I want to say to the officers presently here from the Emden in direct response to the issued orders that the sports day scheduled for tomorrow between our French, English and German shipmates must be cancelled it goes without saying. Ladies and gentlemen may I ask you to give three cheers for our Kaiser. Please stand. Three cheers for our Kaiser. Our Kaiser, he lives - Hoch Hoch Hoch. Yes I'll admit that I too was determined to face the enemy. When the fatherland is in danger you can't just look on. You have to act. At three o'clock, Islands of Japan. 40 miles abeam. At three o'clock, Islands of Japan. 40 miles abeam. Finally back at at sea. And this from someone allegedly newly engaged? What makes you say that? All Tsingtau spoke of nothing else on departure. Yeah, yeah. Her sister told me. - Alarm, action stations! There you go, the first. Position? 34 degrees 45 minutes south and 97 degrees 56 minutes east. Target? Greek freighter Pontoporos on 04.45 degrees ahead. Gross tonnage 8,400, built in 1902. Does not respond to stop order. Fire a shot across the bow. Fire a shot across the bow. Report ready. Fire a shot across the bow. Report ready. Ready to fire. Ready to fire. Fire! Fire! Fire! There you go. Leutnant Overbeck assemble a boarding party. Determine if the freighter has war material loaded. If yes, sink it. Everyone, crew and any passengers to be taken off on our last boat. Then sink her by opening the sea cocks. Jawohl, Herr Kaleun. What are you carrying? Accumulators um generators with er power cable. Where is your cargo to be unloaded? Bombay. Bombay, for the Englaender. You and your crew will be interned. Your ship will be sunk. Yeah but that is nothing but piracy. Herr Captain, please control yourself. German cruiser Emden shifts area Indian Ocean. 1,380 tons of war material sunk. Crew unharmed, a heroic operation. English sentries are asleep. Emden destroys oil tanks at Madras. German warship still at loose in the Indian Ocean. Crews of ships sunk by the Emden safely arrive in Colombo. English sailors praise their treatment on the Emden. Cocos Islands. A peaceful atoll in the Indian Ocean. That night when the anchor was dropped no one could know what lay ahead of us. I had assembled a landing party to eliminate the English telegraph station located there. It should have been a cakewalk after three months at sea finally solid ground under our feet again. What a miscalculation. Kluthe, the situation? Two early birds immobilised both probably fishermen. You can catch the rest asleep but, nevertheless careful. Von Schulau, you take the settlement and civilians. Jawohl, Herr Kaleun. - Overbeck you with your people take the wireless station and destroy it before the Englaender can send a report about our activities. Jawohl, Herr Kaleun. Gaertner. - Here, Herr Kaleun. You attend to with our ship's cook ... Where is he? - Here, Herr Kaleun. Ah Hilgert, you both attend to fresh provisions, the good stuff. Jawohl. - Carry on. Australia is cut off, Batavia comes next. Ha ha ha. Straighter! - Yes! The island was quickly occupied. The Englaender offered no resistance the opposite, in fact. The governor formally invited us to lunch. It wasn't really his war not so much, anyway. I've got something for you. Quite impressive. Er, do have a drink. Thank you. Thank you. Isn't that marvellous. Ship's horn sounds What have we got here? What's the matter, Herr Leutnant? Danger signal is raised. Are they calling us back on board? Von Schulau, leave the provisions. Muster immediately on the beach. Jawohl, Herr Kaleun. Mannschaften, weapons and equipment muster on the beach. Report when complete! Will you excuse us we have to postpone. I fear it's anything but comfortable. The anchor is being raised. Anchor flag is half mast. - It wasn't there before. To the beach now. Mannschaft, weapons and equipment check complete. Get everything ready to go on board. - Jawohl, Herr Leutnant. Gaertner, stay here with me. We can't do anything more. They are already under way and raising the battle flag. The smoke out there was not our bunker ship. This doesn't look too good. Can you tell who is attacking? Those on board know. - An Australian, four funnels. That must be the Sydney. Goodnight all. The order was muster on the beach. So let's go, move it! Short sharp steps! What is going on? - This is hopeless. Schuermann, you've a wicked tongue in your gob. Convinced now? Watch it, or I'll stuff your always grimacing mug no matter how tall you are understood? Bloody Germans an ugly end to a myth. Damn well serves them right. - Yes sir. Good grief. Hats off to pray. Hats on. Gentlemen. The enemy has sunk the Emden. The ship everyone believed was not an individual but a whole fleet of ships. The Flying Dutchman flies no longer. We do not know how many of our shipmates are dead and how many were taken into captivity. But I ask you. Should we accept our fate. Passively sitting tight here until the enemy finds us? That's only a matter of time. Never. Never. We swore an oath. We will fight with whatever we as seamen of the German Imperial Navy have available. What is he going to do, all alone in the Indian Ocean? Over there lies an old schooner. It will be requisitioned. With it we will strike out to Tsingtau. Or if needs be, to Berlin. Right now we're no better off than Odysseus. Which constellations can you make out? Possibly Centaurus. But in Tsingtau it's much higher. Yes Tsingtau lies a lot more further north-north-easterly. Indeed, 3,700 miles. It's from the Centaurs that the Greeks learnt about music medicine and hunting. I would also love to study. Preferably everything at once. Oh well, as for hunting it's come at our expense. What do you think? As of today we are the hunted. You can count on the Englaender making every effort to catch us. They won't put up with the destruction of their cable station and then us escaping as well. But we were not created to do the Englaender favours. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. What unites us is this starry sky. Nothing else. Navigating by the stars without proper charts in the middle of the Indian Ocean. Do we have any chance of reaching our Tsingtau home port alive? Or do we bury each other beforehand in a sailor's grave? Disgusting. In the neighbouring house the Japanese now have the Chinese girls together ... I will not listen. Beautiful Tsingtau, it's all over. All the same we have no business here. But the Japanese. - I wonder what the Emden will do. It can no longer operate from here. What is it? I didn't want to show it to you. 'Emden Destroyed in Heroic Fight'. '345 men in Australian captivity'. Unfortunately 345 men in Australian captivity. Only 345. - Stop. We must be prepared for the worst. Keep quiet! What is it? Uh I'm sorry. We won't stay a day longer in this place. Yes, what are you up to? A Dutchman is in port. It sails for Rotterdam tomorrow. It is fully booked, but I know the agent and he owes me a favour. Smoke on the horizon! Get ready to turn. - Get ready to turn. At moments like this our bloody helpless situation is made clear to me. Where are the days when we could defy the enemy with fire-power, speed and cunning. How long can we keep this up aboard this floating coffin. We have nothing left but the curvature of the horizon to hide behind. The smoke is nearer. Four funnels. That's why we need to turn curtly and sneak away to port. Kluthe, time you finished! Overbeck, from tomorrow all drills to be spot on. Do you understand? - Jawohl, Herr Kaleun. Under the Dutch flag we can get to the Suez Canal unhindered. Unless a German warship shells us. German warship here in the Indian Ocean? Since the Emden no longer exists that should be that. So, how about champagne for the ladies? - Yes. No. May I interrupt the ladies for a moment? I'd like to invite you for a tour around the ship. That's very nice of you but ... My sister doesn't feel too well. - Oh. It's best she stays in the open air but I'd be very much interested. What job do you have on board? I'm the wireless officer. The wireless officer. - Yes. This new wireless technology has always interested me. I'll show you, please follow me. Excuse me. I hope champagne will do. But where is the young Miss Maria? You will have to be content with me. I'd like nothing better. Already three endless weeks at sea. I sense that the angels and the harsh uncertain future, will be troubling. but everyone deals with fear in his own way. Not good, Herr Maat. Bloody Doldrums. Hilgert, here. I was thinking, if you bring me another hundred of these things together they would be good for a soup or something. Norget you arsch hole. - Watch it, watch it. Fortunately in one hour water will be issued again. Hmmm. - Just a minute. Where did that stone come from? - Do we have a problem? Where did the stone come from? It was not there just now. Which stone then? Where is the Kaleun? He's sleeping. What's up? The water in the last two tanks has gone off. Urggh that is undrinkable. The tanks must have been rotten. It leaves only half a tank. There is still the emergency supply. The Englaenders' bottles of soda. That's not much. Don't use that yet the Kaleun wants it kept back for emergency. Ich Ich haette (I would) - Haette, haette Ankerkette! Anything else, Maat Kluthe? No, Herr Leut. Although, I'm more concerned about thieves after the alarm goes off. Anyhow if we get through all of us now depend not on rank as such but on our wise behaviour as well, true. Do you want to lecture me? Or question the boat's navigation? Maat Kluthe talks sense. We can all endorse that. We should use our power well. Maat Kluthe, dismissed! Jawohl, Herr Leut. Well done. - You too. Suck up, kick down. Say that again, Leutnant Overbeck. Repetitions bore me. Yes. Herr Kaleun? Kagi, Trieste, Siberut or Trieste, Kagi, Siberut? The Mentawai group of islands. Which one comes first? Herr Kaleun, we have a water problem. How's that? Two tanks are filled to the brim. The water has gone off. It's undrinkable. Leave me alone for a moment. Overbeck! Jawohl, Herr Kaleun. Close the door. Sit down. 'Fate taught me early to listen to myself.' You said that as we both had, a beef roll in front of us. Your situation assessment? Hmm, our position is nine ... I didn't ask the position. I want a situation assessment. The heat and the Doldrums clearly are getting to the Mannschaft. The water shortage will exacerbate that. I think however the will to persevere, for the majority is unbroken. And you? Likewise, we have no other option. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. No other option. That's what cattle say on their way to the slaughterhouse. We have a number of options. I'll give you three. You choose. Firstly, at the next smoke on the horizon we go to identify it despite the risk that if it's an enemy ship this voyage will be over. Secondly, we turn abeam and search for the Enggano Islands. How many miles abeam do you think? Eighty? Let's hope so, by goodness. Thirdly, we run to neutral Sumatra. The Dutch port of Padang. Then continue by another ship to Tsingtau. Well? No disrespect Herr Kaleun for me there is only one choice. Sumatra, Tsingtau of course. Of course. Is that all then? The water will sustain us for one day. - One day? In this heat not even half unless you're a cactus. Give us all the same. Achtung! Mannschaft fully mustered. Thank you, stand at ease. Water will be issued under the supervision of an officer three times a day. Should anyone be thought of as an emergency so I will personally, serve a bottle of soda on a silver salver. The officers are included in these instructions and yours truly. Rightly so. Should anyone forget who we are. Buck up! Tsingtau's our destination. Thank you, return to your posts. What's that? Jawohl, Herr Kaleun. - Dismissed! Where's Leutnant von Schulau? Still in his cabin. Not feeling too good today that?s why he?s absent. Jolanthe there?s more here. Slowly I wonder whether I'll get through what lies ahead. There are still countless nautical miles to Padang. Even if we make it I'm hoping to get help from the Dutch. Without them we won't reach Tsingtau. An Englaender. What could they do? They could do a lot. Just ask yourself what they want. Good day, my dear. Are there any messages? Unfortunately no. Ship's horn sounds Oh, I was afraid of that. What do they want? - They want the engines stopped. Unfortunately I have to advise. I fly. What's going on? The Englaender has stopped us. This means nothing good. - How's that? A boarding party is approaching in a ship's boat. For something on this ship they will be looking and also finding. What do they expect to find here? Germans. Apparently the Englaenders have listened to the wireless traffic. A wireless operator made back door enquiries about the Emden. In the middle of a war such recklessness. If that's true nothing would surprise me any more. Haul in, lads. The square sale, the square sail sod it! What all this then? Are you crazy? Mahnert, Mahnert! Who sent him up? - Himself. Angels having a laugh. Better than none at all. Cut the square sail! Moeller, get below! - I'm alright. Get below! Jawohl. Mannschaften get below! Come on lads, get below! Aaargh! The lifebelt, go! The lifebelt, quickly! Here now, come on give me your hand. Come on. How long will this old tub last out? Honestly, no idea. As soon as I saw her I had a bad feeling. This wretched rotten wood. Heave, rudder starboard. We'll ride this out. Where is Moeller? Below. - Good, you also get below. Have a word with Mahnert. He meant well. - Meant well? Yes wonderful when the tombstone reads 'he meant well'. Be harsh man, not only on yourself. Ha ha ha ha, never forget there actually are wages of sin. So get below. Yes, yes. Ha ha ha ha ha. What have we here then? Don't take me for a fool. Sorry? Friedrich, I've seen everything. What have you seen? Not a step further! This is private space. - Blimey, Friedrich that's our last water. Those bottles can save lives. I don't need a lecture. Do you know what you are? Deplorable. Put the bottles back. Dreamer. Less than a fortnight longer in Tsingtau and she would have gone with me. Urrgh. Urrrgghh. Enjoying that? From now on keep your gob shut. Understood? COLOMBO Ceylon Docks. I'm curious where we'll be accommodated. Ha, a palace will be popular. Excuse me sir. - Move along, go go. Go, go. - Maria come on. Come on. Permit me. Despite the bad luck, it couldn't have come at a better place for us. How's that? - My family trades in Colombo, tea rubber. Very well connected here. Don't get mad at me but I would have preferred a continuation of our voyage. Waiting as an inactive internee until the war ends. That doesn't appeal to me. Well Jolanthe, it's not your day is it? - Do you need help? Well then, let's see how he gets the sow out. Out now. Give her a smack, come here. Okay. - Come here. Come here. Hilgert, you're so ugly every female wants to get away from you. Even Jolanthe, the beautiful sow. We whack here soundly. He definitely has a high fever. I heard after the thunderstorm he drank from a pool of filthy water or something. Heinke. - My Mutter, she is still waiting. I can't let her wait. To begin with, Matrose Heinke is to be isolated from the others here on deck. Kluthe you check the Matrosens' supplies and monitor their preparation. I'll take care of it personally Herr Leutnant. All right, bugger off up there! Idiot! Like that. Crikey, Hilgert! Bugger off. - Heinke. I wrote to my mother that I will be coming soon. You will. Poor blighter. Heinke come here come here, Heinke. You have to drink, drink. You have to drink. Swallow Heinke. Drink. More water. I will be indebted to you forever and ever that we found such comfortable accommodation my dear Count von Manstein. On behalf of my whole family very good health. Thank you very much. But it was quite natural I took advantage of my English contacts. I think this house is for us all a good compromise and it will ease our detention a bit. I don't think it's a compromise. It's beautiful. If we didn't all have our hearts set on Germany we could certainly remain here for longer. Also I I could remain here for longer hee hee. Wilhelmine, now let's not get carried away, right. We are needed in Germany. It should be our aim my dear Count von Manstein to return to Germany as quickly as possible. I will also furnish an appropriate cheque. First enjoy the dessert. How long can we refrain from fresh fruit? Nice. Oh, by the way I heard from my sources the Englaender hold German prisoners here in Colombo. They are awaiting onward transport to Malta. They could be men from the Emden. Land ahoy! - Land ahead! Land ahoy everyone! To be honest I could hardly believe it. Everything had worked out. We were saved. At least that?s what I thought at the time. Finally able to sleep it off perhaps in a proper bed. But, you can be blinded by euphoria. Yes! Lower the foresail! Hop hop hop hop! Drop anchor! I expect your crew in one hour, all of them at the Harbour Office. On a ship of the Imperial Navy you cannot simply give orders. You bet I can, Neutrality Regulations. If you don't stick to them I am calling the Royal Navy. Ah ha yes. You can call your royal cavalry for me but so long as I command, this ship no man goes ashore. What the hell! I would like to speak to the German Consul. He is my contact. Yes, he's already expecting you. Jolly good, gentlemen. Let the men wait here. Jawohl, Herr Kaleun. - Come, von Schulau. Kluthe. We are speaking with the German Consul. Wait on the waterfront for further orders. Jawohl, Herr Leut. What's this? The German Consul. Kapitaenleutnant von Muecke. Leutnant von Schulau. Welcome to Padang. Chaps, secure oars. Aaargh, aargh. Feel at home, my house is your house. Thanks for the amenities Consul Brockerhoff. But we will wait for a delivery of soap on board together with the Mannschaft to look human again. You cannot imagine how your reputation has preceded you. All Padang is going crazy. Indeed all Padang is going crazy. One is curious who is behind it. Antonia is er my, my wife. The Consul is all heart. Let's say such as my wife. Ho ho ho ho. Is that better? May I introduce the officers of the Emden. Kapitaenleutnant von Muecke. Leutnant von Schulau. Madame. - Leutnant Overbeck. Heroes in your home. What an honour Consul. Very welcome. Explain to me, how come old fossils can get cute women. Cheers gentlemen and from someone you can rely on you can count on in Padang a princely hospitality. I will personally see to it. This is the best place to ride out the war. Indeed, we all wish the worthy men of the Emden following their adventure a pleasant treat. As tempting as internment may sound coming from your mouth I must disappoint you Madame. We will do our best to leave Padang as soon as possible. Come again? You understood me. No internment. The Ayesha is and stays an Imperial warship. That's also why we have little time to lose now and under international regulations just 19 hours. Then we have to go. But the Dutch, think totally differently ... That's why they're Dutch aren't they? - You really want with the Ayesha ... What I want, or don't want will not be discussed on this admittedly beautiful veranda. Good, I understand. No, no Madame please. The Consul and I will now proceed to the harbour. Can you make your coach available? Gentlemen. Go ahead go, the coach. Are you deaf? Overbeck, you go and talk to the Harbour-master. Leutnant von Schulau. Von Schulau. Jawohl, Herr Kaleun. - Take charge of the waterfront. Make sure we can all return at 1800 hours sharp to the Ayesha. I've a special matter to deal with en route. Meet up later. So, synchronise watches. 1627 hours. I'll be fine. You go on ahead. What are you doing? Where do you want to go? First the harbour. - I'm curious Herr Kapitaenleutnant. The last metres we will do on foot. We have to discuss secret matters. Do you really want to put to sea again? How will that work? I'm relying on your help. What are you doing? Where do you want to go? Where to? Ha ha ha. To Tsingtau, our home port. Don't you know? Tsingtau has fallen. Captured by the Japanese. Germans had to leave. The port is in Japanese hands. My men must not find out. Absolute secrecy. I want your word. - You have my word. You have my word. Get in. Do I understand you correctly? First and foremost you intend putting to sea again Under International and Maritime laws we must leave a neutral port after 24 hours. We will stick to that. - Batavia insists on internment. What is the alternative? May I please invite you briefly outside? Please. No chance. Do you really want to fall into the hands of the Englaender and Japaner? An Imperial Navy warship does its own risk assessments. Hey, watch here. Here. Kluthe! Still no sign of Leutnant von Schulau? Unfortunately no. - My queen of hearts. Herr Kaleun. - And? Nothing. This is unbelievable. I'll take care of it immediately ... - There's no time to lose. Up anchor at 4 o'clock. I don't want to give the Dutch an excuse to detain us. I'll go with my men back on board. You search for Leutnant von Schulau. I'll give you Maat Kluthe. When you have found him give a signal from the beach. - Jawohl, Herr Kaleun. I'll send a boat. I'm thinking it's a false lead. The cook at the Consul's house tipped me off. If it's a false lead he'll regret it. Besides he only gets paid if Leutnant von Schulau is found. Get up! - Hey, Karl. Calm down, I can explain everything. Get up. Leutnant. I didn't expect you. What a surprise. Get up. All facts are self evident. You know what's meant by that. - Uh huh. Desertion, disobeying orders subversion of the war effort. Yes. - Therefore. No. Drumhead court martial. Karl don't don't, don't shoot. Don't shoot, I can explain. I can explain. Don't Karl! Urrgh! We are now at the pick up point. You are to keep schtum. Officially you were in the harbour hospital with a bout of fever. Herr Leutnant. Let's drop the Leutnant. Anyway, my name is Karl. I'm Ulrich, Uli fits too. That's fine, on board we'll keep to how regulations specify. But between us, we now know how to do things don't we. Jawohl, Herr Leutnant. Hey Karl man You've got a nice thump. It's an 1893 birth condition. I can box well, watch out. Karl I need 30 minutes in there. What for? - Yes I was looking around the harbour and I found some very fine navigation instruments and charts. At the least useful for us. Leafing through, of the Indian Ocean African Coast. Unfortunately I was disturbed and couldn?t take the things, so I hid them. Alright, just be careful. Don't you think that I have done all this out of comradeship or it's a case of friendship. Better if you had shot me. Yes, perhaps. But who knows what lies ahead of us. We need every man. There are enough others. - But not officers. Although if you make me much longer ... I?ll make you think about something else. Tsingtau has fallen. You're crazy. - Unfortunately not. And the Japanese, have ravaged there like animals. Especially among the civilian population. All Padang knows about it. It's a safe bet von Muecke too. Perhaps you understand me better now. Put to sea again? Into the unknown? What the hell is that about when Tsingtau has fallen Karl. COLOMBO Ceylon Tea Trader's Office Six on the dot. He hates it if you're late, especially so early in the morning. Our informant worked for the Englaender Admiralty for a long time. But he hates the Englaender. No colonial master is popular. The operations of the Emden especially pleased him. Above all, when she showed up sank a Japaner and then vanished. I read about those days in Tsingtau. 'English Days of Slumber are Over.' No introductions please. Just call me Mr Silver. Zeet da official list of war prisoners the German warship Emden. 245 of dem. What name are we looking for? Write it down please. I have it here, Overbeck Leutnant, first name Karl. I can't find it here. Did you find it? My sincere condolences. Just now I was thinking he is only in captivity so still alive. I could have sworn it. How many times have we met up above among the stars. Just shows how wrong you can be. Mannschaft get up! Come on lads, rise and shine, huh. Up up, start shaking the sand out of the eyes. Let's go! Good morning, Maat Moeller. What's with the morning starting with Maat Moeller. Raise anchor. Raise anchor. Course 220. - Jawohl, course 220. For Fatherland an honour he's going to send his entire crew to their deaths. Well done Herr Kaleun, well done. - Schuermann you ... Smoke on the horizon! Smoke on the horizon at 10 o'clock! What the hell are you looking at! Get ready to turn! Cancel manoeuvre! Now, Kluthe! As you were! Mannschaft muster on the middle deck! No reports! Mannschaft muster on the middle deck! Now! Men. During the Padang layover we all envisaged things differently. You can say that again. - Quiet. And for many the question remains what happens next? I received news in Padang that makes a change of plan necessary. Tsingtau is out. - What! It's fallen into enemy hands. From now on the Japanese flag will fly there. Well, that's a turn up for the books. - But I negotiated before putting to sea with the captain, of the German merchant ship Choising a joint course beyond the twelve mile limit. And as it turns out not without success, ha ha ha. That is the Choising. - Ah ha. She will take us on. As of now, we all prepare to evacuate Ayesha. Further orders aboard the new ship. Carry on. Evacuate the ship! As much time as necessary. The young lady can't be expecting us manically hoping it sinks to the bottom. Hurry up, we can't waste any time. Can't hurry with the young lady. Situation? The sea cocks are prepared. The depth is sufficient. 150 metres at least. Then scuttle her. - Jawohl, Herr Kaleun. Alright to scuttle! Scuttle! It slips to the sea bed, Mahnert. I'm glad we finally got rid of the rotten crate. Well now you are back on a proper ship where seamen of the Imperial Navy belong. Es braust ein Ruf wie Donnerhall. Wie Schwertgeklirr und Wogenprall. Zum Rhein, zum Rhein, zum deutschen Rhein. Wer will des Stromes Hueter sein. Lieb' Vaterland, magst ruhig sein. Lieb' Vaterland, magst ruhig sein. Fest ... Smoke on the horizon! That's an Englaender. Probably checking us out. We'll stay put here. No thoughtless movements. And? The Hampshire. - They're a long way off. They have enough fire-power. We're extremely vulnerable. They can banjo us from over there. - They still haven't changed course. Don't stoke the boilers. In, one hour raise the anchor. Wait a minute I am still in command. This is a German merchant ship. We came to help you. Yes, I thought we could avoid formalities. Officially and formally I hereby requisition the Choising for the Imperial Navy. She is a German Imperial warship under my command. Yes but ... - No buts. They're veering off. Merry Christmas. Sueer die Glocken nie klingen als zu der Weihnachtszeit. Gerade als ob Engelein singen Lieder von Frieden und Freud'. Wie sie gesungen in seliger Nacht. Wie sie gesungen in seliger Nacht. Glocken mit heiligem Klang klingen die Erde entlang. COLOMBO Ceylon Christmas 1914 Oh, come on Maria. It's Christmas. You need to take your mind off things. Maybe. It's just so hard to grasp that my true love is dead. He died for the Fatherland. The men of the Emden are heroes. And your Karl as well. We can all be proud of these men of the Emden. That's just nonsense. I can't listen to this. What do I get from a dead fiance. Maria, life goes on. Papa with von Manstein knows about an opening on a steamer. A French freighter. It has cabins. And von Manstein can get us past the soldiers, onto the ship. How come? With his connections. Artful rascal. If we are lucky we will soon be on our way to Europe. Actually right now, I don't care about anything. And von Manstein? Couldn't he cheer you up a bit? Cheer up? He's nice. We get on well. That's a lot already. Are you match making? And what if? - No, no. That would suit us all so well. Now, everything is lost in Tsingtau. Transit through the Suez Canal is closed to Germany. So that leaves the land route. Therefore it will be best for us to try heading for the Arabian Coast. Arabia is in Turkish hands. The Turks we've heard are on our side. In this maritime zone we must expect enemy contact at all times. What paint have we on board? - Sorry? We will disguise this freighter with a new colour. What paint have we on board? Did I just hear that correctly? What paint? Black. White. Yellow. Leutnant Overbeck. I have found a ship, named Shenir. 1,700 tons. It matches the proportions of Choising. Home port Genoa. The Choising will be repainted as an Italian freighter, ha ha ha. Smile Juergensen. Smiling makes you likeable. We must also sort out an Italian flag. Get started, Overbeck. We have no time to lose. I forbid you to use the wireless. Listening to the wireless at any time, violating my orders or those of my officers will be punished under Articles of War. Excuse me, Captain. Who are you? Doktor Barthel, ship's doctor. Very nice. COLOMBO, Ceylon Docks Okay. I'm meeting up with the stevedore for the Liberte over there. Come out on my signal. Only then. Come on guys move. Hurry up, hurry up. Faster, faster. Come on, come on. - On the ship is safety. It's French sovereign territory. - Gangway up, gangway up. Bye bye. Paint. - Look who's here Heinke, my mate. Feeling better? Has the doctor given you something? Yes? Top down. - I've never painted. Herr Kaleun, the ship is repainted and the Italian flag is flying. Well then? Let's see if our disguise works. Ship ahead. Herr Kaleun. Royal Navy, the Gloucester. Stay calm. Bode, dip the flag. - Jawohl, Herr Kaleun. Dip the flag. Jawohl, dip the flag. There we go. Happy New Year, ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. Maria, might I briefly ... French Freighter New Years Eve 1914/1915. Thank you. Maria. Manfred. To the new year turning out well for us. I love such surprises. Then my next question will not upset you. Will you marry me? That's Perim lighthouse. Engine half speed. Engine half speed. Maintain course. - Maintain course. Mahnert. - Herr Leutnant. Inform the Kaleun we have reached Arabia. Jawohl. You takeover, we'll prepare to land. We've always said hurrying through enemy lines makes it harder to get undisturbed to the coast of Arabia. He must be crazy. - Indeed. Herr Kaleun, the rations are enough for just under three days. Not enough space for more. No matter, the land route is our only chance. Move! Help! Watch out! - Heavy. And, can you make out anything? If we're unlucky, we'll run straight into the arms of the Englaender. I can make out some kind of jetty. At least a row of lights strung up evenly. Herr Leutnant Matrose Heinke is worse. The doctor is with him. Leutnant, the Matrose is not fit to travel. Fever, bloody sputum. I can't justify this. Believe me, I really can't. Please, Herr Leutnant don't leave me on the ship. I want to go ashore with you. I want to go home. - Where do you live? Berlin, my mother lives there. After my father's death she is all alone. You will go home, of course. That's where we all want to go. I won't leave you behind. Thank you, Herr Leutnant. Thank you. We are assuming we have reached Hudaydah. Good news for you, Juergensen you'll be rid of us. Make it clear for disembarkation I would be deeply grateful if it happens on time. There I have it, Hudaydah. Small Turkish garrison town on the Red Sea with an important port built during the Ottoman period ... What are you reading from Doktor? The German World Travel Guide. My father in law's wedding present from just a minute from 36 years ago. So highly suited to honeymooners in the last century. We really understand each other. Herr Kapitaenleutnant, gentlemen. What's Walter planning? - I don't know of anything good. The presence of a doctor with a landing party, would be no bad thing for a journey into the unknown. I hereby sign up for duty with the Emden's Imperial landing party. Thank you. There are still patriots. We have enough snowflakes. Gentlemen. I would have left him on board. - He's doing very well. I've pumped him full of quinine. See what I see? A battleship. The presumed jetty is a French battleship. That's why it was so well lit up earlier. Holy crap. Course further north. - Course further north. Course further north. - Course more starboard. Herr Kaleun. You go firm. - Jawohl. Officers on me! Hilgert, look after Doktor Barthel. - Jawohl. We'll sneak into the desert and hide there. In the night a recce patrol led by Leutnant Overbeck will go to Hudaydah to find out the situation. Jawohl, Herr Kaleun. - Any questions? Nil, Herr Kaleun. - All right. Herr Kaleun! Skirmish line! Take cover! Prepare to engage! Prepare to engage! - Clear to engage! Don't fire! - Don't fire! Don't fire! - Kluthe. Kluthe and Overbeck stick with me. Leutnant von Schulau, takeover the landing party. Jawohl, Herr Kaleun. Everyone ready on my command! French look different. I know a Turkish word 'merhaba' means like 'welcome'. 'Welcome.' We tell them 'welcome'? Try it ... What are you doing here? Merhaba, merhaba. We are Germans. German Imperial Navy. Do you see the flag? Germans. The flag, you see the flag? German. Are you friends of the French? Friends of the French. You are friends, of the French? Er er Allemande. Allemagne. - Allemagne. - Allemagne. Yes, Allemagne. Allemagne, ha ha ha ha. Hey, here they are Allemagne soldiers! Allemagne ha ha ha ha ha! Allemagne soldiers! Merhaba. Merhaba. - Merhaba. German Army? - German Imperial Navy. We are men from His Majesty's Ship Emden. Emden? - Emden, yes. All look for. France man blockade harbour because of you. What Hudaydah, Hudaydah is not occupied by the French? France man in Hudaydah? No, no no no no. France man sleep out there, or drink wine. What do I know, what they do, yes? Harbour blockaded for one week, but don't worry not come Hudaydah. Hudaydah, Turkish Garrison. Welcome, on behalf of Turkish Commander. - Thank you. You are our Guests. It's a while since I took stuff like this at face value. I took the firing pins from the MGs as a precaution in case they get stupid ideas. Now then Mahnert, have your relatives come to pick you up? Take care, Norgert. Step by step. We're here representing the German Reich. You'll get that back, stinker. Are they veiled because they are so beautiful or so ugly? We shouldn't care, if the veil stays on when the rest comes off. Exactly, what matters is what it looks like below. Ha ha ha ha ha. Habib, I need your help please, for our onward journey to Constantinople. Constantinople, how do you intend to travel to Constantinople? By the railway. - Railway, yeah railway nice plan but start of war stopped completion of railway. But, you now just come. Why do you want leave again? I can't argue with the map. No railway, no hope of getting to Constantinople. Have we undertaken all these dangers and come ashore for this? Gentlemen, on the situation. The Hejaz railway is running but not from here. I'm currently exploring a march through the desert. From El Ula there should be a rail link to Constantinople. Nothing is decided yet. I'm waiting for news from contacts. Von Schulau, you von Schulau. Herr Kaleun. - You'll take care of new uniforms. Jawohl, Herr Kaleun. - Thank you, gentlemen. SUEZ, Egypt Thank you. And Madame. Nonsense to disembark here. Preferred to stay with the French. They had great food which I haven't had for a long time. Manfred knows what he's doing. And that is best for us too. Your Manfred. If he says one day jump overboard we should all do that too? All of a sudden? There was a time not so long ago that you were so friendly it was was embarrassing. Stop it! Just the prospect of of British passports justifies everything. In the Suez Canal it's supposed to be teeming with English controls. If Manfred arranges things again I swear ... So what. It's important that we get English passports. They will be gold to us. Gentlefolk, it's done. The photographer is waiting. Very good. Okay, thank you. The Egyptians like us Germans. Only because they don't like the Englaender. No wonder, when they have the Suez Canal under the thumb. The later stuck in photos are no better than the originals of the British passports, needless to say. The Warringtons passed away in South Africa. You sir are Charles. - Charles. Your wife remains Elizabeth and Wilhelmine will have to get used to Martha. Maria and I are the Mountlavinias. A Rhodesian married couple. A married couple? - For appearance sake. I would urge that. I suggest I explain briefly our Canal passage. With an Englaender through the Canal and then God willing onto Marseille. Go on. - That's not possible. What. What are you doing? I know you?d withhold it. She needs to know. Suddenly so concerned for her? She's happily engaged now. Wilhelmine! Maria. 50 survivors from the Emden have turned up in Sumatra. Crikey, it's been so long since I had a wife. I know that. You are married and know where you are going when we make it home. Me I'm totally up in the air. Being secretly engaged. It's not following social norms. How things stand, I don't know. Whether she remembers me or wants to remember. - Peace be upon you. That for me? - Yes for you. What's this? You sure? Dear German Officers. I would like to briefly introduce myself. I am a Turkish scientist from Constantinople and have been living in Hudaydah for several weeks. I would like to meet up with you to discuss a concern. However as a Turkish woman a meeting in public is only possible with difficulty. If you agree my servant will lead you to us, Salima. Come closer, gentlemen. Thank you, no. I'm glad you followed up my request. I must admit to an unusual situation but I didn't know what else to do. No problem. What can we do for you? Take me to my brother. What do you mean? I must go to him, but between us lies the desert. He is in Jeddah and cannot travel. He needs me. Everything else is unimportant. But I can't do it on my own since this Englaender, Lawrence dominates the desert. It's very dangerous if not impossible. You hear ahem, about him here on every corner. He has a large section of the Bedouins behind him. It makes the way north unpredictable. That's why we won't be leaving Hudaydah soon. Can I ask something? How is it you speak such excellent German? My grandfather was a German professor in Constantinople and married a Turkish girl. I can also help you as an interpreter. I speak Arabic and several Bedouin dialects. Doktor. - Yes. I boiled the water. - Yes, come right in. Jawohl. - All right. Thank you, put it down. Getting undressed Kaleun? You are not the first, Kaleun. I?ve already treated at least ten today and others are waiting outside. The problem is, the water here is actually undrinkable for us. The men's bodies are weakened through infection. Breathe in. Breathe in Kaleun. Kaleun. - Ugh, yes. What's wrong? Thank you. Excuse me Herr Doctor. Herr Kaleun my herbal brew is ready. Very well proven, to put you back on track. Thank you. I never said it tastes good ... - Can I Mmmn. - I'm grateful to you. Nevertheless Kaleun, take three times daily one spoonful. One spoonful. Am I crazy? I understand. No, no. I'll tell you something. My father had a good doctor's practice in Goerlitz in Silesia. Of course he assumed that I would take over. But me, I wanted to be a ship's doctor. Out in the world. Everyone said I was crazy. They were probably right. That's me, and it's also you. Doing what we do I suppose we've got to be crazy. Oh yes. Have I dragged my people to here so that they go down with some disease? Outside the harbour the French are still waiting for us apparently. The Red Sea is teeming with English gun boats that want to intercept us. And us? Yes to date we have managed to remain undetected but we're setting ourselves up to perish in this bloody shithole. Sorry to interrupt you. Heinke is in a bad way. Put him down there. I'll look at him right away. We have to leave here. As soon as possible. - Leave, from here with all the sick through unknown desert? - Yes. - Kaleun. And you will make sure that the men are fit to travel. Hudaydah. El Ula. The contacts have confirmed at El Ula the railway goes to Constantinople. With respect Herr Kaleun. You intend to cross the desert on foot? Not only me, you too. All of us. And, not on foot on camels. So, departure tomorrow night. Any questions? Good. Herr Kaleun. I had another question. What about the Turkish girl? I will take her. The Turkish girl comes with and stays under the personal protection of Leutnant Overbeck. With respect Herr Kaleun. - With respect Herr Kaleun. I allow myself to point out ... - Here you will allow yourself nothing. Thank you gentlemen. PORT SAID, Egypt Papa. - Here you are at last. He's alive. We must hurry the ship to Marseille sets sail in two hours. Papa he's alive. The Daily Mirror has published the names of the officers who dealt with the authorities in Padang. The men from the Emden later escaped Padang, and he is among them. And now, why are you telling me all this? I have other worries. I got engaged to von Manstein as I thought Karl was dead but I was engaged to Karl. Come again? We were secretly engaged in Tsingtau. I knew it wasn't possible otherwise. You wouldn't have allowed it. What am I supposed to think of that? My daughter gets secretly engaged to a have not. It's clear you were looking to see how much someone brings into a marriage but those days are over. But I loved him. I still love him. Love. And if, how long? I hope your mother and sister have finished shopping. Besides, we've not had a talk yet. About what? To mark your marriage to Count von Manstein a lucrative for all of us trading company, will be set up. With entry for the von Mansteins and von Plattenbergs, on equal terms. I didn't know about that. Why have you never spoken to me about it? You don't want to jeopardise everything do you? So, yes or no it's about our very existence. Arghhh, oomph. - Ha ha Schuermann, eating a little sand? Indeed Schuermann they can't stand socialists. They have good noses. According to your empty head. They're just camels. Well, Schuermann. Come here, wait. Eh Come here eaarch eaarch eaarch. Do you see? That's how it goes, eaarch. So now get up there. There you are. Go on. Jolly good, here. Hold on tight. - You'll work it out. Oh, when will this end? Up to now I've been riding a wolf. The rest stop will be soon. At last I'm no longer worried about dismounting. Despite Suleika we get on well, eh. Oh, the carpet must be beaten like at home. Right Suleika sweetheart? MARSEILLE TRAIN STATION, France Pay attention to me and remember ... We are married and come from Rhodesia, I know. We'll wait here until they've both been cleared. Thank you, good day. Come on, come on, come on. They're leading my family off. Go on! Get to the train, now! You are endangering the whole operation. Is that what you want? I'll deal with it. Any problems? He wanted my daughter's date of birth from me but even without false papers who knows their daughter's date of birth. Ha ha ha. I Knew it of course. There's filth everywhere. So, coffee has to be fresh. The pan down there please. Roasted coffee, not fried. Mahnert. - Herr Kaleun. Post a sentry on the north and south flanks. Relieve every two hours. - Jawohl, Herr Kaleun. Herr Leutnant, water issue. - May I disturb you briefly? I've brought you water. Boiled. Herr Leutnant. - Yes. Berlin. I ... She's still waiting. She's still waiting. - Of course, Heinke. Everything will be fine. Really? He's put it behind him. Ich hatt einen Kameraden. Einen besseren findest du nicht. Die Trommel schlug zum Streite. Er ging an meiner Seite. Im gleichen Schritt und Tritt. Im gleichen Schritt und Tritt. Had I left him on the Choising he would still be alive. You want to be responsible for Heinke's death, forget it. These feelings are human. But if your life is precious to you bury these feelings until you are back home. Otherwise we'll never get there. Between MARSEILLE and VALENCE What should I tell them? Tell them what you want. I can't eat. You have to eat something. - I don't have to do anything. You believe Karl Overbeck is alive. Frankly in the long run, it's not fair you break the engagement. You can have von Manstein if that's what you mean. Don't you worry about who or what I can have. I would like that too. Papa unfortunately has other ideas. Really, not so long ago my sister loudly trumpeted that she would never let anyone dictate who she marries. That's still ringing in our ears. Alright, here we go. Guten appetit. Look left. On the ridge. - Another caravan? A little fast for a caravan don't you think? About 12 Bedouins on the left flank. To Kaleun pass it on. About 12 Bedouins on the left flank. To Kaleun pass it on. 12 Bedouins on the left flank. To Kaleun pass it on. 12 Bedouins on the left flank. To Kaleun pass it on. 12 Bedouins on the left flank. To Kaleun pass it on. Dismount! Form two lines! Officers to me! - Form two lines! Overbeck, three MGs to the front one to protect the rear. Overbeck, takeover the rearguard. Von Schulau also to the rearguard. - Jawohl, Herr Kaleun. Stronger hostile force in front. About a hundred men. Report from Maat Gaertner. Dig in! - Dig in! Kluthe, get the MGs mounted. Mount the MGs! This will wear everyone down. Where is that MG! Over at the camel. We need the bloody MG! - Stay in cover. You must only command. Friedrich! Hochgaertner, Gerling let's go! Friedrich! Hochgaertner! Friedrich! Arrgghh, arrgghh! Hey! - All round defence! Aid station in the centre. Build up a strong water reserve in the middle. Dig rifle pits. In them put cooking equipment and everything of equal value! The large box to me. Men with rifles space out evenly around the position. Redistribute ammunition. - A shovel here for this water. This is our most prized possession. Lochewski, we are manically digging our own grave, perhaps. Let's hope not, Vivaldi. Perhaps. - Got it. Everything alright. So mates, don't leave the pit. We'll be rolling again soon. Aaarghh, aaarghh. Under the canopy. - Aaargghh, Aaargghh. I need gauze dressings. - From where? In my bag. More. Gerling, the Cognac. Are you crazy? What are you doing? No crazier than anyone else. I was quicker. Don't ask me how come. Overbeck! Can I leave you alone for a bit? - I could say the same to you. Find a suitable camel driver. He must attempt a night breakout from the position. Jeddah, the next Turkish base is not far. With luck he'll get there. - Jawohl, Herr Kaleun. Aaargghh! Leutnant Overbeck, to aid station. Yes? It's, it's yours. Mine? Forgive me. I've been, such an idiot. I ... I didn't mean you to get her. Do you know the Lords Prayer? Yes. Will you pray? Vater unser, der du bist im Himmel. Geheiligt werde dein Name. Zu uns komme dein Reich. Dein Wille geschehe. Wie im Himmel, also auch auf Erden. Unser taeglich Brot gib uns heute. Und vergib uns unsere Schuld. Wie auch wir vergeben unseren Schuldigern. Und fuehre uns nicht in Versuchung. Sondern erloese uns, von dem uebel. Amen. They're gone. Take it. It doesn't make any sense. Wanting to survive is not senseless. - Wanting to survive for what? I forced him in Sumatra at gunpoint from the arms of a woman to return to the landing party. I wanted to save him from the consequences. For what? So that he croaks now in the dirt! Dreadful mess! Hrrmp, urupaagghh! I'll help, Herr Kaleun. - No no no, I I, can manage. A dead camel is just as good cover as a live one. Unfortunately it smells a little strong after a while. I hear you want to send one of the camel drivers for help. You can't trust them Herr Kaleun. Before I became cook on the Emden I was ... You were in the French Foreign Legion. I know. Do you want to go back? - No. While at Sidi Bel Abbes I was trained quite well to move in the desert. Maybe even better than cooking. I request permission to break through enemy lines tonight and contact the Jeddah garrison. If I can do it, I'll get help. If not then at least I tried. Fate does not mean to treat us well. Another three days and nights in this ghastly desert. We only have water until midday today and Hilgert it seems did not make it. Last night I heard shots in the direction of Jeddah. So tonight we'll try to breakout. What that means for us everyone knows but it may be that some get through. If we don't undertake it we will be worn down and killed. Little clear response. Aarrgghh! You must have it dressed. No, it's alright. Damitz! - Porter! Thank you, my dear. At last. Oh I'm sorry. I'm mostly sorry. Allow me precious. - Home air. Mit Russ und Dampf und Oelgestank. At last. - Maria? Home. Have you seen the wounded? Yes. It's awful. That's the war. Now come on, or we'll end up in the marshalling yard. Aren't we there already? Hey. I must talk to you. Very pleased to but ... - I don't know whether I can remain engaged. Maria, you are tired and worn out. I love you very much. And now come on. Otherwise we really will end up at the marshalling yard. Carry on. He deserves it. Why is it so quiet? Have they moved off? Anyway, shall we swap? Swap? My offer. Clear them up in the lull. What's this then? Raise the war flag. The Turkish girl to me. Ask what they want. They want to speak to the commander. All right. Everybody stand to! If it's a trap then return fire without any regard for me. I have to ask you to come with me. Sure. - I'm coming. No, Overbeck I hereby handover to you the command of the position. Come. Everyone ready on my command! Kapitaenleutnant von Muecke German Imperial Navy. They are here on behalf of the Emir of Mecca. And he has sent his second son ... Who? He has sent his second son Abdullah with a force to help. Abdullah brings greetings from his father, the Emir of Mecca. He regrets the incident in the desert. But now the way is clear. The German soldiers are under the personal protection of the Emir of Mecca. Water. Everyone, that's Hilgert. Ha ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha ha. Yes. Ha ha ha ha. Ha ha ha. HEILIGENBEIL ESTATE, East Prussia Beautiful estate von Plettenberg. Congratulations. Thank you. Age-old, family-owned. Mortgageable? What do you mean? - It was a joke. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. I will make you happy. I promise you. I know that. I love you. We both know that love is fleeting. Not mine. Abdullah and his force say goodbye. From here to the railway the territory is safe. I'll also say goodbye. My brother is waiting for me. Goodbye. Peace be upon you. Upon you be peace. Train whistle sounds Train whistle sounds Did you hear that? Train whistle sounds Quiet! Train whistle sounds Train whistle sounds Yes! Yes! Overbeck, come. - Jawohl, Herr Kaleun. Kluthe, you lead the landing party. Jawohl, Herr Kaleun. Everyone ready on my command! Hey, hey! Train whistle sounds So, anyone without a bottle here? Are you looking forward to seeing your family? They are on the Baltic. With my brother at our parents house. He's a fisherman. Looking forward? My thoughts limit my looking forward at the moment. At least you can expect to get back with them. Who knows maybe there's some other bloke lying happily in my bed. A newspaper hack, I heard, declared us stone dead. Adelheid Guesthouse. Herr Leutnant. There's a visitor waiting for you in the lounge. Karl. May I introduce to you Count von Manstein. Welcome home. Thank you. So we meet again. Yes. I have a telegram to send. The Koenigsbergs also want to come to the wedding. I'll book the Hammersteiner Palais for them. I'll return in a quarter of an hour. Good evening. Yes, so we meet again. Things change. That was a gift. Yes, for the engagement. Mine is at home. Oh Karl. I'll write to you and explain everything. Don't bother. - What's your address? Why are you living on the Baltic and not in Berlin? I'm spending a few days leave on the Baltic with a shipmate. Still not tired of the sea? Once more once more it has to be favourably disposed towards me. What do you mean? Owing to war events His Imperial Majesty is unavailable. The Iron Cross will be presented to the landing party by Generaloberst von Leutenburg. Kapitaenleutnant von Muecke. - Jawohl, Herr Major. Take over. Although military discipline compels me to hide my feelings I can?t stand these parades and awards. Achtung! Eyes left! Beg to report present Emden landing party of two officers, four petty officers and 37 junior ratings. Thank you. Stand them at ease. - Stand at ease. Thanks to his Majesty the Kaiser's support of the Imperial Navy the German Reich dominates the World's seas. And not through a great number of warships but by clever engineering and tactics are we compared with the enemy. You men of the Emden are an example of this worth imitating. You have shown that obedient servants are needed to appropriately and cunningly implement the will of the Kaiser. In this way the illustrious landing party of the Emden earned special merit. Such fighting spirit such daring is needed by the Fatherland. Well? Cheerio. What's up? - Nothing. Goodbye Herr Oberleutnant. So that's it. Your next commission, Overbeck? The the, Wiesbaden. Whether in uniform or otherwise, we'll meet again. Kapitaenleutnant, the Herr Generaloberst will see you now. The Generaloberst will see you now. Take care of yourself. Thank you. And? What do you say? - It's big. I don't mean to intrude, chaps but this is about my boat. The old man left us the cutter jointly. He did no such thing. You went into the Navy. That boat is registered in my name. I'm responsible for it. Right, and? Has the Oberleutnant thought very carefully? All right. It's desertion. You know that, right? Nobody will find out. It stays in the family so to speak. Yeah, punishable by death. No kid, I have family. Me too. Assisting desertion is just as bad. The Herr Oberleutnant has a connection with the big nobs through Maria. But we don't have one. We must think about that if we get caught. So, I can't take the Oberleutnant over to Sweden. I am sorry to say. Paule! Hey, what's going on? What do you want with that old tub. The sea is calm. Karl it's a lull. You won't get far. You'll get caught out in no time. It's suicide. I won't let myself be captured. Hey Karl. A fisherman wrote down for me the name of his boat. Which fisherman? Are you crazy? What are you doing here? I've brought you your ring back. And I want you to wear it. And me too. Uli, can we get the small tub seaworthy? Bugger the small tub. I'll take take you across, with that one. Here read. Bring the boat back in one piece. Bon voyage, Paule. Now for this journey everything seems to be behind us like an impossible dream. But ahead of us? In a short time we?ll be on our way to the next front. Karl and Maria got married in Sweden and had three children. Many men of the landing party fell at the battle of Jutland in 1916. Among them was Maat Kluthe. Hilgert the cook after the war opened the "Cafe Arabesque" in Berlin. Matrose Norget became leader of the Spandau branch, Nazi Party in 1934. Matrose Mahnert was killed in 1942 in Sachsenhausen concentration camp. Kapitaenleutnant von Muecke fought in vain in 1956 against the rearmament of the German Armed Forces.
