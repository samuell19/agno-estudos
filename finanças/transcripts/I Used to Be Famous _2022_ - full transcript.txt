This is your time. This is your time. This is your time. Right, fellas... showtime! Your time. Right, let's have it, boys, yeah? Your time, Vince. Stereo Dream! Stereo Dream! Stereo Dream! Stereo Dream! We're here in London for the final stop of the Stereo Dream world tour. The fans cannot get enough of those five boys, led by the edgy, the mysterious Vinnie D and the boy-next-door, Austin. Come on then, boys. Energy, yeah? Energy! Let's go! Stereo Dream, we love you! Stereo Dream, we love you! Hey, how you doing? - How's it going, all right? - Good. You do live music here, yeah? - Occasionally, yeah. - Check this out. - Nice, is this your stuff, or... - Mm-hmm. It's not finished yet, but you get the vibe. I've got my synth here... - Um... - I could play it live for you. Yeah, I think we're good for now, but, um... John the Unicorn? How does anything get picked up if you don't wanna listen? We have listened to it. It's a complete mess. - It's a demo. It's a bit rough. - Yeah. No, no, I can hear that. Um... - But you get the idea? - I absolutely do. - Um. Yeah. - Yeah, what do you think? It's gonna be a no from us. Yeah, that's cool. That's fine. It's cyclical, you know? The music scene. So it's just... wait for it to circle back around. - A couple of weeks? - Uh, bigger circles. Look, the only way you'll ever end up on our radar is if you have complete songs and the numbers to back it up. Numbers? Like a few hundred thousand followers on Instagram or TikTok. Hey, check this out. It's not finished yet, but you get the vibe. I get that, but it's not our thing. Okay, what's your thing? Well, not that. - Sorry. - Sorry. Get an audience, yeah? Vinnie D! How far the mighty have fallen! Now look at ya. Busking off Rye Lane. No, I'm not busking... I'm practicing. Bit depressing though, innit? Come on, let's hear it! Oh, go on then, be like that then. Prick. Well, your hair looks shit anyway. You should go back to your blond boy-band look. Get your sweet potatoes! Pound a bowl! Pound a bowl! Get your tomatoes, fresh tomatoes. And your peppers! You all right there, mate? Hello? Yo... My bro, I'm trying to practice, man. Just working on something. Fucking Peckham, man. Yeah. - Yeah. - Woo! Woo. Yo, keep it in time, man. Stevie! Stevie! Stevie! Stevie! Where did you go? I was looking for you. Thank you. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to shout, but, please, I was looking for you for ages. Stevie? I'm sorry. Come on. Let's go. Hey, that was sick, man! Listen, he shouldn't be out here on his own. I'm sorry if he disturbed you. He didn't disturb me. But that was awesome. You were really good, man. Okay, thanks. I was walking up and down the street. I couldn't find you. I was panicking. ...some amazing things up in the Lake District, didn't he? We'll find out more about that on Sunday night. Now, we are delighted to welcome to the studio, the great Austin Roberts. - Good morning! - Good morning. - It's great to see you. - Thanks for having me. So this is it. You're releasing your final album after an extraordinary career. And of course you have the farewell tour coming up too. Yeah, yeah, it's been a long ride. I guess I've been very blessed. The fans are going to be very gutted that it's the last one. How do you feel about that? Are you gonna miss performing? The fans have been good to me over the years. Music has been my life, and it's given me everything. Yes, from your days with Stereo Dream to your amazing solo career. Now that you're winding down, Austin, do you have any regrets? Regrets? I definitely regret those shocking hairstyles we had in Stereo Dream. Thank you so much for joining us... You're a fucking idiot. Hiya. What can I get you? Are you all right? - Yeah. - Wanna drink or...? Yeah, please. Can I have a, um... cider, please? Great. Okay. Cider. Thank you. D'you know, just... a half-pint will be all right, you know? Thank you. I, um... saw you've got a new live music night starting up and... Yeah, I'm up for it. Not everyone gets to perform at Peckham's Finest. It's quite exclusive, you know? Yeah. I mean for me it's not really about getting to perform. You probably don't recognize me, but... - I used to be... - Vinnie D. Stereo Dream. Yeah. - Oh. - I'm Mel. I'm Vince. I know. Anyway, I'm finally working on my solo album. - Finally. - Yeah. But, yeah, I just need a couple cozy, intimate venues like this to perform at before I go on tour. Know what I mean? Do you reckon? Look, Big Dave, he chooses who plays and... he's quite picky, so... Please? I... I think you made a mistake. - I just wanted a... - It's on the house, Vinnie D. Dave... Vinnie D. He used to be the lead singer of Stereo Dream. A boy band from 20 years ago. Anyway, look... He's got material for his solo album, which he wants to showcase here. No. He'll bring in a whole bunch of new punters. No. Hi, Vinnie. Um, it's Mum. I know it's been a while. It's Ted's birthday next week. Um... And I'll be going to see him and I thought you might want to come. Okay. Bye. Okay, Stevie, take it away. - Oi. - Sorry, mate! Ah. Go. Yes, Stevie. That's the one. Come on, my man. Mm. Yes! Shit. Yes, sir? Hi. Are you here for the, uh...? What are you here for? - I think I'm lost, you know. - And now you are found. Come. Come. Come join us. Sit here. Dia, there's no drums left. Oh, he can have my own. Sit here, my friend. You are welcome. Okay, everyone, we go again. We play the heartbeat again... My brother, what is your name? Uh, Vince. Everyone say hello, Vince. Hello, Vince. We say, "You are welcome, Vince." You are welcome, Vince. We go again, and this time, I want Vince to be the heartbeat. What does that mean? Close your eyes. Everyone, I want you to breathe together. And in. Two, three. Four. And out. Two, three. Four. Breathe. Two... You will feel it soon, my friend. Feel what? The change. Again, breathe in. Two, three, yes, four. Boom goes the heart. Bang goes the drum. Boom goes the fire and the morning sun. Try it. My brother, take off your jewelry. Yes. Ah. Together. Yes. Hey, with me. Together! Ah! Hey! Together. Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! That's it! Ah, ah! Ah, ah! Here we go. Hey, hey. And now the change. Hey, hey! Follow his beats. Hey! Say what? Ah ha! Let's go. - Well done. That's the one. - Well done, darling. Take a bow. Take a bow. Uh-huh. Too much? It's good though, man. I'll keep working on it. It looks like Stevie has a new friend, huh? Stevie? Come on, baby. Let's go. See you later, Stevie, bruv. Oh, and by the way, sing a little bit lower next time. Cheeky little shit. Come on, Mum. Slow down, Ted. Vinnie's already set everything up. - Come on. - Oh. We saved you the VIP seat. VIP? That's a bit fancy, Ted. Look what Vinnie got me! - A harmonica? Did you say thank you? - No. Remember. Don't rush. Take your time. - Play when you're ready. - Okay, Vinnie. Oh, my boys. Well done, fellas. Well done, Ted. Well done, Vince. Mr. Denham. You've been unemployed for a while now. And I see you have no musical training at all. No, I just always had an instinct for it. Just natural charisma and talent. Okay. More of a Lennon than McCartney. Yeah. Probably. It might help having other options. Vinnie! - Vinnie! - Oh, fuck's sake. Check this out. This is the other day. Sixty-four thousand views. No. We look wicked. Dave, what's happening, bruv? You all right? - About Peckham's Finest. - Do you want a drink? Because if not... No, I do. I do. But I need to show you something first. Check this out. See that? I've got an online following. - Couple of hundred thousand views... - Shh. They're all fans and they're all local. Imagine the bar take. Next one's in a couple of weeks. If you can't bring the kid, you can forget about it. No, he'll be there. He'll be there, I promise. All right? Nice one. One, two, three, and... And four, three, two, one. Okay, you two, not bad. Not bad. Listen, we're finished for today. Until next week. - Put your stuff away, okay? Be right back. - All right. - All right? - Yeah. Hey, Stevie, man, can I show you something? Look, bro. Now check this out, man. Look. You see? That's me. That's you. And it's on its way to, like, 100,000 views or whatever. And because of this, I got us a gig at Peckham's Finest. If we're gonna do it, we need to practice, man. We need to rehearse, rehearse, rehearse. What do you think, man? I never had a gig in my entire life. Yeah, this is your chance, dude. In front of a real audience. Look, I was in a band once, you know? So trust me. With my experience and your drumming, it's gonna be banging. Sounds scary though. I don't like big crowds and sudden things. Don't be scared, man. We can change that. I can help you. - Hey, have you got your own drum kit? - Yes, Vince. That's sick. Everything all right, Stevie? Yeah, Mum. Vinnie and I are gonna do a gig. It's going to be banging. - Ignore him. - Wait, wait, wait! Let me show you this. - Ignore him. - Hey. Community Matters, yeah? Yeah, of course it does. What's happening, mate? Hello. Where's your mum? She's on the phone, working. Is she one of them hotline babes? What's a hotline babe? Never mind. Look, Stevie. Stevie, I need to level with you, okay? Dude, what do you want more than anything else in this entire world? Maybe I can help you with it. Come on. I want to go to music school. Right. Listen, if we do this gig, it's going to open up some real opportunities for you, man. I've got some really important people coming down. Do you know Austin Roberts? No? All right, well, he's a really big deal. All right, and if we impress him, Stevie, we might be able to go on tour. Imagine me and you on tour together. - That's a lot of performances. - Yeah. Is someone at the door? Stevie, this is something I've been trying to get back for a long time. I really need your help with this. How you doing? It's nice to see ya. - What are you doing here? - I invited him for a cup of tea. And biscuits. Jammie Dodgers. Yes. It's... funny... My... My brother used to do that as well. Couldn't wait to get to the jammy bit. How old's your brother? He'd be... 34, nearly 35, I think. But he died years ago. Oh God, I'm... I'm really sorry to hear that. That's all right. Wasn't your fault, was it? Was it? Is that you? Up there. Yeah, that's me. You're a dancer? - I was. - Yeah, she was really good. Yeah? You don't dance anymore, no? You know... Things change, so... Vince is in a famous band, Mum. Yeah. I was but... yeah. Things change. What famous band was that then? Do you know, um, Stereo Dream? You were in Stereo Dream? With Austin Roberts? Austin Roberts is going to be at the gig when we perform. There's not going to be a gig, Stevie. Can you please stop mentioning that? Well... actually... - Well actually what? What are you doing? - I'm only trying... No, no, no, you have no idea that you're putting him in a dangerous situation. Do you understand? I can't have that. He wants to perform and... he needs an audience. He said it before. - Stevie, tell her, mate. - He has no idea what that involves. Please don't come here and start putting ideas into his head. Ideas in his... What are you talking about? This is his future. That's not for you to say. Other than drumming, do you know anything about his life? Anything about autism? Anything... Exactly. You know what? Look at this. I really don't want to see it. I'm not interested. Look, he can do it. He's really good. I'm not letting you interfere with his life. Interfere? You know, I'm giving him an opportunity and now you're holding him back. You don't know Stevie at all. If you don't let him follow his dreams, he's going to stay like this. - Stay like what? - You know what. I don't. You have all the answers. Go on, like what? Tea time's over. I think it's time you should go. Oh my God, Stevie. Stevie? Stevie? Stevie? Stevie? Stevie? Sorry. Sorry, baby. Stevie? Stevie, just take a deep breath. Deep breath. Oh shit, where's his...? - Is he okay? - I just need to find his... his sticks. I'll be back in one second, okay? I'm just gonna go and find them. One second. Don't... move or do... Don't do anything. Stevie, are you all right, mate? Stevie, are you okay? Stevie. Stevie, remember that Dia song? Well done, mate. That's it. Take your time, man. Just... Just breathe. That's it. I finished a tune! It's banging, Vince. It is, innit? I just need to write some killer lyrics. And I'm loving those tins, dude. Yes. I love the sound they make. Yeah. Me too. And it'll make you stand out. All proper drummers have that. You know, that edge. Like Dave Grohl, Chad Smith. I like Jack DeJohnette. Who? Jack DeJohnette, he's a drummer. Plays jazz alongside Keith Jarrett. I never heard of him. Sick rhythms. Anyone else? I also like Bach. But he's not a drummer. Bach? Just... keep practicing, mate, and you'll be the next Bach before you know it. Why would I want to be Bach? I'm me. It's not about being you, is it? It's about being someone. Back in the day when I used to walk out on stage, I wasn't going out there as me. I was someone else. I was Vinnie D. What happened? Ah, just band stuff. I wanted to do my own thing anyway, so... It's perfect. Shall we, uh... work on these lyrics? Okay. Vinnie D. You ready? - Yeah, man. - One, two, three, four... They're nice, man. Make sure to slap that on the story, fellas. You know the vibes, engagement, engagement. - Hashtag... smoothie porn. - Yes, sir. Straw-gasm. Straw-gasm! You smooth operator, man. Whoa. Mango? That don't look like mango. Mr. Roberts is ready to see you now. Cool, man. Thanks. What is the point? You can tell the A&amp;R guys, you can tell the publishers, absolutely not. We are not wavering on this at all. Not even by one percent. You know that, Will. Uh, wait here, please. They should be done in a second. I loved it. I loved it. Great sesh, man. Great sesh. Great sesh. - Great job, man. - Yeah. - What's happening, bruv? How are you, man? - Hey. Oh, good, yeah. Song sounded wicked. Yeah, just... a song for my daughter. Here, have a seat. Thanks, dude. Listen, I'm deep in rehearsal, so I don't have a huge amount of time. It's cool, I was... just in the area, passing through. - Had a couple of meetings so... - Great. Yeah, just thought I'd come and see you. You sound tight. Well drilled, man Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But listen, how are things with you? - Wicked, actually. - Yeah? Yeah. On top of the world, man. Um, just working on a new EP, writing some new stuff, and, um... yeah. I discovered this... brilliant little drummer, actually. Yeah, and I've got this, uh, gig coming up. It's exciting. It's, uh... just for the fans to... feel what they're feeling. - I like to do that. It's important. - Yeah. You, uh... got a new project out, innit? Yeah, well, you know. All systems go here then? Getting ready and that? Yeah, man, you know. You know yourself, you gotta put in the work. - Right. - Everything's gotta be on point. Gotta rehearse, rehearse, rehearse. - Dude, I literally say that all the time. - Yeah? Yeah, I say that to the drummer all the time. Yeah, you used to say that to the boys back in the day. Yeah, I remember. We used to take our lead off you, man. That was good times though, man. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Best times of our lives, eh? Well... mine anyway. Listen, man, it's been really nice catching up. I gotta take a pee before the next rehearsal... No, it's cool. Then I got a bunch of support acts I gotta talk to. With the support acts, I wanted to talk to you about that. I wanted to show you this, just, uh... a little intimate kind of... I just thought maybe you could come down if you got time or whatever. You know, man, I'll try my best. - Yeah? - Yeah, well, look, no promises. Okay, but, you know... Wicked, man. Okay. - I really gotta take a pee. - No, it's cool, yeah. - Okay. - Well... - Great to see you, bro. Proper. - Yeah. - You too, man. - Nice one, man. - Okay. - Okay. Yes! Yes, we're ready, man. Smashing it, dude. Maybe we should make a new name for it though. What shall we call it? "Smashing It"? We'll work on that. Try something for me, man. Relax your shoulders. Relax your face too. Come on, man. You're a rock star. It's about attitude and presence, man. Yeah. Stand up. Try this. Stand up, man. You're a rock star, bro. Take a deep breath. You hear that? They're calling our name, bro. They're calling our name. Can you feel that? Yes, Vince. I'm feeling it. We'll practice that. Okay, boys. Ready to go? That is a lot of people. You know, if you change your mind, that's totally fine. He's going to be fine, all right? He's gonna smash it. Come on. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. You all right? - You're on next! - What? You are on next! Hey, we got to be quick. Come on. We gotta set up now. Sorry, guys. Excuse me, please. Sorry. Crowd's a bit wild tonight. Wild's my middle name, so... Now, it's always good to be a bit competitive with the other acts. Gives you an edge. - All right, we ready, yeah? - Yes, Vince. I'm just gonna be over there. Let's hear a massive round for the wonderful Mysie! Yeah! Give it up! All right, ladies and gentlemen, we have a debut! Stevie! Now, here... here at Peckham's Finest we're all about grassroots talent. So from the square, just off Rye Lane, I give you... What are you called again? - Huh? - Name of the band? Denham. Like denim but... Denham. That's a terrible name. Ladies and gentlemen, The Tin Men! I never said that. You all right? It's different. You'll be fine. You're with me. Just take your time. You go when you're ready. Sorry. Hurry up! Really good. Can I get a "fuck yeah"!? Fuck yeah! Thanks, Mel. Um... This next one, you might recognize but, we gave it a little Denham... We gave it a little Tin Men remix. Thank you. This, um... This next song is... - Jesus, they're playing another one? - It's about someone I... Christ, Vince. Just get out. ...I miss very much. - Is this for real? - Be nice! Don't worry, let's go! I paid to watch music, not this shit. I'm trying to listen to the band. Shut up! I don't give a fuck. I'm trying to talk to my mate. This band is shit anyway. Shut up! Go home! We got you! Oh, he about to cry? Give it a rest! Shut up. Music? That's not fucking music, mate. Geezer's playing pots and pans. This prick's brought an ironing board. The state of them. Look at them. The drummer's a weirdo. - Hey! - Shut up, man. All right there, mate? - What's wrong with you? - Leave him alone, man! Vince, what are you doing? Stop! No! Get off me! It's okay. Stevie. It's okay. Let's get you home. Come on. Help me. Get off me. What are you doing, man? What are you doing? Hey, be careful! - Ironing board. - Leave it! Here's your kitchen utensils. - Bruv... - Here's your little trolley. - Hey. - It's a lifetime ban. All right, let's get the music back on! You okay? What happened? Rock and roll, mate, innit? Hey, man, let me help you with that. What, like last time, yeah? - For fuck's sake. - Vince. You know what? Thanks for coming though, yeah. Can you just go, please? Please? Okay. Amber, open the door, please. Plea... - Amber, I'm sorry. Please! Open the door. - What do you think you're doing? I'm sorry. I was trying to help him. I need you to listen to me now. I gave you a shot and you fucked it up. That's on you. Do you understand that? - I was trying to protect him! - You weren't. Getting into a fight isn't protecting him. - It's time to grow up. - He needs me! - Vince, nobody needs you. - Keep it down, please? He's got talent. Amber, he's got talent. Real talent and you want to let him rot away in his room. Don't you ever, ever come here again. And don't you ever try and contact Stevie. I fucking mean it. Yeah? Fuck you! Fuck you! Fucking come on. Thank you. Right. So where do you want to go when you come out? America. How you gonna pay for that? Well, I hear you're doing pretty well these days. He's a dickhead. Right, come on then. 'Cause you look like shit, bruv, I bought you something. Thought it might cheer you up. What? I love it when you two play. Right. Remember this? Ted, do you want me to...? Now, bring it home for me, bro. Aw. How long for? A while. It's a thirty-day tour. That'd be wicked. I can't believe it. This is your time, Vinnie. Maybe. I'll still be back for your birthday though, yeah? - Oh, don't worry about it. - No, bruv, I'll be there. I promise. All right? Oh, that would be lovely, Vinnie. No. No, no. Oh. No. Will you definitely be there Friday? Yeah, Mum, I'll be there. I promise. Yeah, we'd really like that. He's... not doing so well. Look, Mum. It's getting kind of crazy here, but I'll see you Friday. Okay, then. Bye. - Excuse me. Thank you. - Love you. All right, yeah, I love you. Bye. Bye. Guys, guys, guys, I need to let you into a bit of a secret. This tour is not over. Due to popular demand, we've got another ten more dates. Uh, when does that start, Dennis? First one is this Friday. Amsterdam. Um, is there any way we could push that back a bit? What could be more important than this? Uh... No, it's just that I promised my, uh... I might need a couple of days to... Don't take too long. We might change our minds about you. Uh... Uh... Um, yeah. No, of course. Yeah, I'm there. I'm there. Good man. Right. Right, champagne. Hello, love. I'm so sorry. Ted... He's gone. He died this morning. Ladies and gentlemen, we've arrived at Hastings. This service terminates here. Thank you. Vinnie. About Ted's birthday... I'm sorry that I didn't make it down. I wanted to, but... You know how it is, innit? That's okay. I was thinking about that harmonica Ted used to play, remember? Think it's still up in the loft? - It's just, I kind of wanted something... - No, I don't know. Mum? Mum. Sure you don't know where it is? - I told you I don't know. - I'll look myself. - Don't! - Why not, Mum? Oh, you can't ambush me like this. I don't know where it is. Stevie? Stevie! Stevie, I'm talking to you. Can you stop that, please? Can you talk to me, please? What's wrong? Okay, I know he was your friend. You don't need him to enjoy music, Stevie. I want to get better. Why? So I can go to the very good music school. Well... That's a really big deal, darling. That's a really big deal. You know, I think that might be a bit much. I think that would be a lot for anybody to take on, okay? They wouldn't have the care facilities you need. I don't need them. I want to be like other musicians. You don't need to be like anyone else. Okay? You're perfect just as you are. No, I'm not, Mum. But if I study, you won't have to look after me anymore. So you could do other things. I don't understand that. What...? What do you mean? You stopped dancing so you could look after me. Stevie, look at me. Look at me, Stevie. I really need you to hear this, okay? That is not true. I didn't want to be part of that world anymore. I wanted you. Okay? I'm not a child. I don't need you anymore. Hey, man. What can I get for you? You can get me a manager. - The manager? - Yes. All right, just give me one sec. Hi, I'm the manager. I'm gonna have to give you this. We're looking for some cozy venues to do a gig before we go on tour. I think we're probably gonna be a bit too small for you, mate. All right, mate? Oh, hi, bouncer. Got any ID? I'm 18, nearly 19. All right, have a good night. Oh, good evening. I'd like to give you this. Not much effort in that, is there? We're, um, looking for some cozy venues to do a gig before we go on tour. I don't think this is the venue for you, lad. I recommend you take a look at that. This is your band, is it? Yes it is, with my man Vinnie D, called The Tin Men. Nice. Yeah, like I said, we're not really booking at the minute. Are you 100% sure about that? You know what? Give me your details and I'll see what I can do. Awesome. Take a look at that. It's got Austin Roberts. It's gonna be bloody banging. Yeah? Vince. It's me. Stevie? I've got us a gig. Whoa. Slow down, man. What are you talking about? The place is called Bar Star, and the manager's called Marnie. Dude... listen, man. It's... It's over. Bro, I'm sorry for what happened. I'm sorry for your mum as well, but... She don't want me hanging around you no more, and to be honest, I can see why. If you come to the music group, you can say sorry to her face. - Stevie, mate... - Anyway, see you on Thursday. Bye. No, no, no... Now, just ignore him, okay? Vince, please, just leave us alone, all right? Why are you lurking around in the car park? I'm not some kind of sex offender. I came to say sorry. That's all. Yeah, he's apologizing. He's not a sex offender. Stevie. You know he put you in danger. You do get that, right? Did you invite him? - Stevie! - It's important. He didn't mean to do what he did. It's true. I didn't. Mum, please. I think you should hear him out. Go on then, what? I'm sorry. Both of you, I'm... I'm really sorry. I made it into a dangerous situation. That's on me. Mum, he was trying to protect me. Okay. Okay, we are ready to start. Come on. I think the class is starting. Today... Ah, Stevie! Ah, welcome. Join us. Vincent, long time. Take a seat. Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick. Today, we are going to start with some singing. Who wants to be the heartbeat today? Vincent, you should be leader today. Find us our heartbeat. No. Trust me, you don't want me doing that, man. Who wants Vincent to be leader? - Yeah! - Yes, Dia. - Do we want Vincent to be leader? - Yes, Dia. Uh-huh. The group has spoken. Ignite the circle. You want me to find the heartbeat? You can't live without a heartbeat, can you? Except this guy. Am I right? Who's going to sing first then? Nadeera? I know you've got a beautiful song in there waiting to come out. Go on, just... take your time. No? When you're ready, yeah? Come on. Who's next then? Saul? No? If you don't sing then... I'm going to have to serenade you and we don't want that, do we? That was really good, Nadeera. That was beautiful. Who's going next? - Me. - Me. Me. She never sang like that for me, you know? You are good at this. I was just lucky, innit? Uh-huh. Listen. I'm looking for someone to take over for me here. I want to put your name forward. - Me, teaching? - My brother, when you got it, you got it. How much it pay? - The pay is okay. - Yeah? But when you are good, you can help a lot of people. The joy that comes from teaching through music is better than any money or success. We'll talk later. Hey. You did well today. Very well, Vinnie D. Thanks. Hmm. You've been busy. Hopefully we'll hear back from one of these soon. I kind of had a... offer as well, actually. Do you know anything about music therapy? Oh. Thanks, dude. You all right, Vinnie? Oh, you all right, yeah? Hello? Hey, bud. It's Austin. Oh, hey, man. I wasn't expecting your... call. I'm sorry about what happened last time. Ah, don't be silly, man. It's fine. To be honest, you had a point. I could've stepped up for you more back when, uh... Anyway, I just got shown a video of you and your drummer performing at The George. The sound is really great, man. - Thanks, man. - Basically... No promises because I gotta run it by Den, but... you're in the mix to take the supporting slot on my tour. If you're okay supporting me. Would you be free to come down to the studio on Friday for a chat? Yeah, let me just, uh, check the old schedule. I think I can make that. - All right. Brilliant. - All right. See you then, mate. All right. Cheers. Nice one. Oh my... Are we playing Bar Star first? No, man. No, we're going on tour, I want to write something new. I can't even believe it. You know, a month ago I couldn't even finish off a verse. Now we're The Tin Men. Hey, we need to get your mum on our side, though. All right, I'll speak to her. Right. No! Get out! No, no, no, no. Dave, you gave me a chance, right? And I blew it. I'm sorry. I apologize. Okay, give me 15 seconds and I'll be out of here. Mel, hi. Hello. Do you wanna go for a drink with me? Not here. Not here. Okay, somewhere else. Somewhere nicer. Um... sure? Cool. I'll be in touch. All right. Dave, it's been emotional. Everything's so small from up here, innit? Hey. Great to see you again, Vinnie. Yeah, man. - When was the last time we...? - Uh, Smash Hits Awards. Fuck me, was it as long as that? God. Oh. You look great. Hey. Listen, we want this tour to be huge. Yeah, we need a support act that has some real meaning to the fans. I want you to support me on my final tour. No way? Maybe at the end of your set, I could come on stage and join you? We could do one of the old hits. Yeah. Thank you. - Yeah. - Thank you. What about Stevie? - What, the drummer? - Yeah. I kind of need him 'cause we're The Tin Men, innit? Yeah, I get it. He's a talent but, um... Listen, we all know what happened at that pub. You can't be running that kind of risk, Vince. You can't have a special needs kid with zero experience going out drumming on the tour. Steady on, mate. I think he'd be all right if he had a bit of support. He's a good kid. All I'm saying is this is about you. I've got drummers ten times his caliber, you know? Ones that can handle the crowds. You're going to be playing these songs to a massive audience. And we all know you've got unfinished business up on that stage. You might even get an album off the back of it. Don't tell me you don't want that, Vince. No, of course I do. Of course. Stevie. I had a meeting with Austin and his manager Dennis yesterday. Stevie, they asked me to... They asked me to do the tour by myself. On my own. What about The Tin Men? They just weren't up for it. I think 'cause me and Austin have got a history, that's the only reason they want me to go without you. I really thought they were going to take a punt on us, mate. I really did. I tried. But this industry is... You only get one shot, and that's if you're lucky. It's a very great opportunity for you. Yeah but, I don't know if I'm going to do it yet. I haven't decided, I just... I said to them I'd think about it. If you have a second shot, then you really have to take it. There will never be a third shot. Thanks, man. You really mean that? It's my birthday next month. That's wicked, man. What are you gonna do? I'm going to go to a restaurant for something to eat with my mum after the music group. - Nice. - Do you want to come? Yeah, man. Yeah, I'd love that. It sounds like a plan. Goodbye, Vince. You going? I'll see you later, Stevie, yeah? What happened, Stevie? I need to practice, Mum. Please. Okay. Okay, my friends. Let's start. Are we ready? Where's Stevie? Where's Vince. Not everyone is here today. But we'll manage. What's this? Do you mind? Oh. Okay. You know, I saw Nadeera's mum today. Everybody misses you at music group, she says. You know, I still don't understand why you're not going. Nah... It's not the same anymore. Sure you don't want me to come with you? - Definitely don't need your sticks? - No, I'm all right. Thank you. I can do this on my own. Just have fun. Have a great day, and I'll see you at home. Yeah, okay. Just... turn around. Okay. Go. I love you. This is our state-of-the-art percussion department. Come this way. This is our world-class concert hall, which has played host to some of the finest musicians in the world. - Did Jack DeJohnette play here? - That's correct. Right over there. I love you, Mum. I love you too, baby. Amber. Hello. You okay? Can we talk? Yeah. Yeah, come in. Thanks. How you been? - I'm okay. - Yeah? How's Stevie? How's he doing? Yeah. You know, he's going to need some time, I think. Yeah. It was a... a bombshell for both of us. Oh yeah? Going on tour with Austin Roberts. You must be devastated. I wanted it to be with Stevie. You must be relieved it's all over now though, hey? Not really. Come on, now. I know you've always hated me. I've never hated you. Look. You have managed to bring out something in him that no one else has been able to do. It's actually really annoying. I saw how much you meant to him. It made me really happy. Why do you think I agreed to the gig? I don't really know, really. Because I saw how bloody brilliant The Tin Men were. You know, these days I look at Stevie and I see these flashes of the man he could be. You know? I was holding him back. He was sort of stuck, you know. Yeah. But... I can't just stand by and watch his head get filled with empty promises. I can't do that. He was never in it to make a name for himself, Vince. You were. All he ever wanted was a friend. I was his friend. I am... his friend. Should have been both of us. But it's not. It's Vince Denham on tour and... That's fine. I shouldn't go. - Don't say that. - No, I shouldn't do it. Vince, you've wanted this for so long. You really deserve it. But I need you out of his life. What about his birthday? He asked me if I... I'm sorry. I hope this goes well for you. I really do. But I've got to draw the line here. You understand what I'm saying, don't you? He needs to find his own path now. Yeah. Yep. Vinnie, I'll introduce you to Jay and Ryan. Jay's, uh, producing, and they've been playing around with your tracks and coming up with some good ideas. I think, you know, making it a little bit more, uh, palatable, uh, for our audience. So it's just a demo and we ripped the track from a couple of the clips you sent over. - So it sounds a bit rough. - Yeah, he'll get it. Just play it. It's a bit more current, yeah? Yeah. Do you reckon we could, uh, dial back the reverb a little bit? Kind of sounds like I'm in a cathedral or something. Yeah, I mean, we can talk about all this, but this is the right sound. This is really good, yeah? Okay. That's it. Turn it off. Guys, uh, I just need to be with Vinnie, uh, for a few moments. If you could just, uh, leave us, that would be great. Thank you. Take a seat. Just gonna leave this with you. You want me to sign this now? It's... standard terms. You take your time. When you've signed it just come and join me and Austin out there, yeah? Don't take too long though. We might change our minds about you. Thank you. Go on. Let me see it one more time. Maybe we should frame it. Mm. "The Royal Central School of Music." This is so brilliant, baby. Thank you, Mum. It's only a recital. Well, I'm bloody proud of you, whether you get in or not. Happy birthday, my beautiful man. - Thanks, baby. - You're welcome. Thank you very much. No problem. Happy birthday. Thank you. What the hell is that? Stevie? Oh, you're here! Come on then. Don't be shy. Sit down, VIPs. I'm Mel, by the way. Hi, Mel. Um, hi? What the hell is going on? Happy birthday. Thank you. It's on the house. Thank you. Courtesy of Mr. Denham himself. Enjoy. How you doing, Stevie? Hi, Amber. Um... Happy birthday, bro. Um, I just wanted to do this just to... I just feel... You know what? What I'm trying to say is, I think you're banging, man. Proper. Not in a weird way, but, like... Um... Yeah. You get the gist, innit? Happy birthday, Stevie. Hi. Hey! Let's go. Come on. Hey, come on Stevie! We got an empty seat up here, bruv! Come on, Stevie! Go on, Stevie! Hey! Woo! This is your time. Come on, my man. Woo! Woo!
