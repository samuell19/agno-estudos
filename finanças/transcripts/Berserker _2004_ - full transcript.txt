(MultiCom Jingle) - [Barek] I remember the beginning, 1,000 years ago and before then the story had passed through the ages from mouth to mouth and father to son. A tale a king never tired of telling and his princes never tired of hearing. The story of Odin, the most powerful of all Viking gods. Weakened by his love for the beautiful Valkyrie Brunhilda and angered by her rejection of him, he chained her to altar of Asgard and cast her below on the flaming mound in Midgard, home of mortal men to be held in bondage to him until Ragnarok, the great battle and the end of the world. (moaning) Many courageous men would perish in their quest to free this beauty and win her love but the gods decreed that only he who is pure in heart would vanquish the flames that surround her and lift Odin's curse and he who was victorious would become invincible in the face of Odin's fury, binding Brunhilda eternally to his protection. (metallic clanking) (mid tempo drumbeat) (Celtic flute music) And so the Valkyrie's blistering prison, the fiery knoll grew taller with the splintering bones of brave young warriors. Time intensified the legend, fanning its flames in the hearts of her nation's sons and firing the imagination of its princes. Boar, give me your hand. My brother and I, Boar and Barek, sons of King Thorsson prepared for the day when we would become eligible warriors united in purpose. Together in the beginning, bound by blood and obsession but doomed to be torn apart by my victory and his damnation. Come on, Boar. (chattering) (grunting) (Celtic style singing in foreign language) - Lower the sails! - Lower the sails! (grunting) (Celtic style singing in foreign language) - [Thorsson] Oars! - Oars! (steady, slow drumbeat) - Slow the beat. (drumbeat slows) We're entering death's door Barek, ready the men. Well? - Turn the boat around. This is an unholy alliance. We don't need the aid of Hell to make you King. - No. Olaf and Algier are pledged to Sigurdsson. Even now their warriors move to meet him in the north. - And Eric? - Eric is defeated. And Thorum sits untouched in the west. If he joins with Sigurdsson, we are lost. I hear your advice Barek and 'tis wise. But time and tide has forced our hand. If we can survive this storm, all the nations would be united and the power of our people will grow and consume the earth. Now ready the men. - I pray you're right. (Celtic style flute, violin music) - Are we sure? - No. But we have no choice. (water splashing) (shouting) (distant thunder booming) Ready the men, Barek. - Let's go, men! (water splashing) - This is a dangerous gamble. These Berserker outcasts place their love of Odin before family and king. - We must have this alliance. Sigurdsson will destroy us if we don't destroy him first. (water sloshing) - At least with Sigurdsson, it would be a clean death. - Let's go. - Barek. - Mord, you still breath. - And feed off the meat of those who fall to my ax. - Well if it's Norse flesh your belly desires, step forth and take it. - Mord. We have brought you a gift. Where's my son? - Show us. - [Thorsson] He's accepted a gift, we'll have safe conduct. - Maybe, be on your guard. (ominous ensemble tones) (distant howling) (growling, hissing) - Boar? - Father. - You've changed. - We've all changed. The bite of the Valkyrie makes us strong. (growling, hissing) But it also has its price. Svien, you see the beauty of Odin. One bite and you too can embrace it. - No. I'll stay as I am, mortal. Let the dead look to their own. - [Boar] I see the nerve of the Norse has weakened since I left. (hissing) - Call them off. Call them off! - Why would you not give the gift to your friend that you so readily gave to your brother? - The only gift you were given was your life. It was you who chose to twist and turn evil. - Enough! You know why we have come here. We need your help. - And you expect it to be given freely so that my father can become king of all he surveys? - You are my son. (growl) - My father is Odin. (tense, intermittent drumbeat) And these, these are my brothers. (thunder booming) I'm Hell's warrior. I am, I am Berserker! Odin! (growling, voices shouting) Why are you so shocked, brother? I am as your whore made me. - Come father, my brother is dead. We'll get no help from this monster. - Stop. I will help you. I will let loose my brethren on the armies of the Norse. We will sack the villages and burn the people and make my father king. - Why? - So we can drink their blood and roast their flesh because that, that is what makes us strong. - And what price must we pay so that Hell can feed? - I want all the lands that are taken from Sigurdsson and I want my brother's soul. Come Barek, feel the power of Odin. Come with me, lead the chosen. - Never. - Then wither and die! - Better that than I should become like you. - I accept your offer. - Sire, no. - Sigurdsson's land will give Boar a fresh start and one man's soul against the destiny of a nation is a small price to pay, even if it is my own son's. We accept your offer. Let our armies join in a week. Barek, when you are king, the choices you make are sometimes hard. - But you still make them. - What else could I do? Without Boar, we lose. With him, we become a Viking nation. - If we turn Boar and his Berserkers loose to maim and kill, will there be anything left to call a nation? - Yes, if you stand with me. Boar is lost to me as a son. Help me, help me to chain the bear so he only feeds on the meat that we throw him. - Help you? If I do, what happens when it's over, when you're king? You feed me to Odin's course? Call down the Valkyrie to drain my soul 'til the Berserker's rage burns in me so that I maim and kill and feed on the blood of the weak? - Never. Boar is a fool, I owe him nothing. I will use him as a tool and then cast him away. - You play a dangerous game, father. Boar is no fool and Odin's wrath knows no bounds. But you swore an oath. Who will pay when you break it? - Believe me Barek, I will unite the clans and make us a nation and you will be king when I am gone. (relaxed violin music) - [Warriors] Odin, Odin, Odin, Odin, Odin, Odin! (warriors chanting) (anxious mid tempo drumbeat) Odin, Odin, Odin, Odin! - Odin! (screams, battle cries) - If Odin is watching, we'd better not disappoint him. For Thorsson! (warriors shouting) (weapons clanking) (grunting) (gurgling) Retreat, retreat. - Boar! (groaning) (growling) (men shouting) - [Boar] Odin! (relaxed ensemble music) (shouting) - [Villager] You see who that is? (villagers chattering) (growling) (thunder booming) (echoing knocking) - Open the gates. - Open the gates! (chain clanking) (gates creaking) (ominous organ, violin music) (thunder booming) - Sigurdsson's people now bow to me. - Under the benevolence of the king. - Quiet, serf. You also belong to me. - A deal with the devil is no deal at all. Call me serf again and I'll take your tongue. - Halt. Boar, look around you. (gates creaking) (chain clanking) - Father what is this, father? - I told you Barek that you would be king when I am gone. - You would be a fool to renege on our deal, on Odin's promise. - Odin's promise? (Thorsson laughs) You are the fool, you always were Boar. You think Odin listens to you, that he cares how many you kill or what flesh you eat? - Father, the gods-- - The gods! The gods, or the old or the dead or those who are about to die. - And what about your word to your son? - I have but one son, Barek. - You traitor! - Now! Archers! - Svien! (arrows whooshing) No. Boar, the flames, the flames! (weapons clanking) - Kill him! (grunt) (flames crackling) (screaming) - No not like this, not again. Not again. Odin. - Barek, don't call him! - No father, you made the pledge. If Odin releases Boar, he can have me. - Son, don't! - Odin! (rumbling) Odin! (electric crackling) (growling) (thunder booming) (snarling) - Why? Why do you call on a god who would destroy you? - I will not watch my brother burn. If your god wants his petty bargain, have him step forth and take it. - One bite and his power will flood your veins. We will be together again, like when we were young. Unbeatable. (snarling) Our swords will carve out the future. - No Boar. If you love your brother, take me. It is I who has broken his word. Let Odin's wrath fall upon me. - You think yourself worthy? A father who would turn his back on his sons, who has broken his word to his god? Did I ask to become as I am? (growling) Did you help to fight the whore that made me? No! It was only my faith in Odin that kept me sane, that drove her from my mind so I could turn the armies that she made against her and I could lead my brethren back to Valhalla. You. You dare to come here where you can be seen for the liar that you are? - Don't listen to him Barek, he's a jealous fool wallowing in self-pity. - Barek! Barek, don't trust the witch. - I love you, Barek. What difference does it make what Odin wants? His power cannot touch you. (electric crackling) (snarling) - No! (buzzing) - He killed six people. - And another 10 since he was locked up. I'm telling you this is not a good idea. Nobody goes in there, not even his own doctor let alone taking him to a standard ward. The man is dangerous. He not only thinks he's Napoleon but every other murdering psychopath that's lived in the last thousand years. - You're being stupid, Clifford. - I'm being stupid? I'm not the one planning to turn him loose. (electronic whirring) (metallic clanking) (chain clattering) Brace yourself. He prefers the name Barek. - Why is he chained up like that? - He always has been. - Can he see us? - Nope. - Then how am I supposed to interview him? - Use the intercom. (electronic beeping) (tense violin music) Stupid bitch. - Violent psychopath with delusions of grandeur. Apart from Viking Berserker, cursed by Odin. You believe you are the reincarnation of Charles IV, the Mad King of France, Ivan the Terrible and Peter Kurten, the Dusseldorf Vampire. Oh and um, Rasputin. Why Rasputin? - Oh god. Because Rasputin was mad, they're all mad. - You can talk, I'm assuming he can talk. (speaking foreign language) What? - Those were Odin's words when he cursed Brunhilda to sleep on the hill surrounded by flames until a mortal of pure intent released her. - And was she released? - You know you were. - Told you. Nuts. (speaking foreign language) (buzzing) - Release him. - What? - I said release the chains. - You can't. - I can, Clifford. (metallic clanking) Now if you want to keep your job, you help me run this place the way I want it run. Chaining up the patients is not a good place to start. (buzzing) (chain clattering) (thunder booming) (low, ominous chanting) Barek? - I'm here. - I'm afraid. - Of what? Of who? - Odin, Odin. Please promise me that you'll stay with me forever. That you'll never, never leave me. - I won't leave you. - Promise me. Promise me that you'll stay with me forever. - I promise. I promise. (labored breathing) (tense mid tempo drumbeat) (ominous ensemble music) (gasping) (alarm blaring) - Come on, move. - Barek. (groaning, grunting) (glass shattering) (gurgling) (electronic humming) (chains clanking) (grunting) (buzzing) (anxious mid tempo drumbeat) (grunting) (dramatic violin music) (gurgling) (thunder booming) - Odin! - Dr. Anya Green. - Good evening, Dr. Green. Carry on. - Excuse me, make way. - Come on, coming through. (soft chanting) - Clifford. Clifford, what happened? - I have no idea except my hospital has become a slaughterhouse. I told you, let sleeping dogs lie but no, you had to go your own way. - Me, why is this my fault? - You unchained him. 15 years he's been here quiet, no trouble. We left him alone, he didn't go mad. Then you arrive and he slaughters half the hospital. - Barek did this? - [Clifford] Him and some other lunatics dressed as Vikings. - And where is he? - Gone. No, no, no. You come in here like-- - Dr. Zorn. - And you think-- - Dr. Zorn. Dr. Zorn, what details can you tell us about this incident? - Well the detectives are still going through the closed circuit television, it's all a bit of a mystery. - [Lisa] And the assassins, what do we know about them? - [Clifford] Very little at this stage, Lisa. (gasp) (tires screeching) - No! (car alarm beeps) (bottles clattering) (anxious up tempo drumbeat) (anxious violin music) - Stay away from me. - I can't. You've found me after all this time. So once again we're caught in the glare of Odin's eye. Our souls are linked in this time like any other, until my brother is dead and Odin destroyed. That's why you undid my chains, isn't it? Listen to me. Give yourself a chance. Time to think. I carry the curse of a jealous god, a being whose wrath and thirst for vengeance has spanned 100 lifetimes. He's sent the Wild Hunt to bring you back. Think. Remember the terror as you were ridden down and chained to the altar? Remember the pain as the flames burnt away your will? Hear the screams of the men who burned in those flames trying to save you from Odin's prison. Do you remember how it felt when I lifted you from the rock? Feel the passion of our first kiss. (thunder booming) - No! (grunting) (weapons clanking) (engine revving) (tires screeching) (fire crackling) So Boar rescued Brunhilda from the flames. - No. Boar heard you calling. His mind was confused. He'd heard you calling to him before when we were young. But this time, he couldn't resist and stepped into the flames. We heard his screams, then he stopped. Boar! (screaming) Boar, no. I don't know why. Whether it was Odin or the specifics of the curse, but the flames never touched me. They burnt and cooked Boar's flesh whilst he was still living but I felt nothing. They left me unharmed. I lifted my burning brother into my arms and carried him from the fire and as I stepped from the flames, they just died. Help him. - Put him down here. - [Warrior] Go fetch the king. Barek, no. - [Brunhilda] Free me. (chains clattering) (anxious violin music) (mysterious guitar tones) (eerie chanting) (thunder booming) (dramatic ensemble music) (soft, mysterious ensemble tones) (eerie chanting) (coughing) - I did it, Barek. She called, I answered. I freed her. - Easy, Boar. - [Boar] She's beautiful. - [Barek] You need to rest. Is there nothing else you can do? - I'm Valkyrie, Barek, there's a limit to my power. All I can do is breath the power of Odin's spirit into his veins. - Then do it. - If I do, your brother will change. Grow strong and dreadful in his lust for war. The Berserker rage will fall upon him and no casual blade or mishap shall ever do him any harm. Only fire or a sure stroke to kill the brain could ever kill the Berserker power that my bite will bestow. - But he will heal. - Yes. His body will heal. But I cannot speak for his mind or his soul. But he will be strong and whole. - Do it. (anxious up tempo drumbeat) (hissing, snarling) - Barek! Help me. Barek! - It is done. Your brother will sleep and grow strong. You did the right thing, Barek. - Thank you. - But this isn't over, Barek. Odin's not just going to let me go. He will send his warriors to bring me back and claim me again. - He cannot whilst I'm with you. I freed you, you're mine, not his. He has no choice. He made the rules and above all else, he must stick to them. (water sloshing) You've been dreaming again. - I thought you said they were memories. - Memories, dreams, nightmares, what's the difference? - I don't know Barek, why don't you tell me? You're the man who's lived for 1,000 years and accomplished nothing. - But this time it's different. - Why? - [Barek] Because I have changed. I'm less confused. - Oh boy. Are we in trouble? - The fog of Odin's spell is lifting. Even your charms have less hold. (soft chanting) (water splashing) (giggling, moaning) (anxious ensemble music) Boar. (thud) - [Brunhilda] Barek. - Why him? (snarling) - He saved you Boar, carried us both from the flames. - Liar. I, I freed you. I, I saved you, it's me you owe your life to, not him. (growling) - You arrogant fool. Your brother saved your life and nursed you for weeks and you, you turn your back on those who gave you life. - The only thing you gave me was a bite that you thought would enslave me! - Boar. We are both undead. You are now a warrior. (growl) Valkyrie-made. One of my growing army of warriors born to help overthrow Odin. Yield to the Berserker that you have become and I will help you grow strong. (anxious violin music) - Get off. Who are you? Stay away. - Barek. Where is he? - Gone. - Where? - I don't know. - You don't know? (groaning) And what about the woman, where is she? - Please, I don't understand. Who are you-- (grunt) - Odin's whore. Where do I find her? - Please, I don't understand. - You don't understand. I saw you with Barek and with her and I know that you know. - Anya, you mean Anya. - Anya, yes. - She lives down by the river at the converted warehouse apartments. Apartment number 13, please that's all I know, please. - Let's hope so. - I can tell you that he's a delusional psychopath. - [Barek] Who are you calling? I said no police. - I'm not calling the police, I'm calling Clifford. - Why? - Because he's the only link your brother has to you and I and if Boar comes to call, I wouldn't want to be home. Would you? - We should leave. - No answer. And go where? What's wrong? Hmm? - Boar wasn't always evil. When we were younger, we used to play and fight, same as any other brothers. But it was father's lack of interest in Boar which darkened his soul. (Thorsson laughs) And his resentment grew and grew. Boar, what's wrong? - Father said we were going hunting, I've been waiting. The dogs are ready and so are the men. - Let them wait. - But you promised. - Later. - Boar. Boar, come back. - Leave him be, let him sulk. I'll take you hunting later. - [Barek] Because of this, our bond only grew stronger. - [Thorsson] This is how it's done. - Well, that's all changed because he sure hates you now. - Does he hate me or is it Odin who forces his hand and turns his sword against me? - Come on Barek, you've changed him into some kind of indestructible monster. - I did what I did to save his life. - At what cost? He repaid you by destroying everything you've built. - But why? - You made him Berserker. - I didn't know the depth of change your bite would bring. - [Boar] This way. Come on. - And if you had, would you have done anything different? - I didn't know. - Where? - Just over there, just over-- - Split up. (elevator humming) (light up tempo drumbeat) - Oh shit, follow me. (dramatic ensemble music) - It's that one, this one here. (grunt) - I don't see anyone. Do you? (light up tempo drumbeat) Let's go. (dramatic ensemble music) Come on. - Oh please. (grunts) Let me go please. - Shut up. - Boar. - [Clifford] Please. - Barek! You first. - No no no, no. (Clifford screaming) (glass shattering) - Barek! (faint up tempo electronic dance music) - Gimme your coat. (people chattering) - Hey. Hold it there guy, I haven't seen you around here before. - [Barek] Are we gonna have a problem? - Barek. It's all right baby, he's with me. - Okay. (up tempo electronic dance music) - We need a diversion. (laughing) (elated screaming) (up tempo electronic dance music) (grunting) (screaming) (electric crackling) (weapons clanking) (groan) (snarling) - Odin sees you, witch. My sons are coming and they bring death. - Oh shit. Who is it? What are you? Why are you doing this to me? - You know why. - You want to kill your brother. - Do you think I am stupid? I see right through you. I know more than the gods have planned to reveal. You see, they cry and they clamor on the age of human consciousness but there is little they can do to help you now. - Barek will destroy you. - Will he? Are you sure? - Oh yes. He will cut our your heart, eat your soul and send you back to the Hell from which you were spawned. - You made me, witch. As you made all our kind. - Yes. And I too will destroy you, Boar. You and your petty god, doomed by his own hand when he imprisoned me. Leaving Barek beyond his reach. - Beyond Odin, perhaps but not me. (thunder booming) (growling) - Barek. Help. (soft chanting) - What has he done to you? - I have stripped away her veils so you can see her as she truly is, Odin's whore. - Not is, was Boar. I saved her from the flames, Odin has no claim to her now and neither do you. She belongs to me. - Belongs to you? She belongs to no one, man or god. Can't you see how she uses you? - Don't listen to him, Barek. Kill him. Kill him. - Who tore your soul from you, Barek? - Your god did that. - Who condemned you to the torture of life after lifetime of this suffering? - The bargain was made. My soul for your life, Odin had his way. - Thorsson repented. - Why should I believe you? Cursed of a cursed god. - Because I am your brother and I always will be and all that I have become and even her power can never change that. - Brother. And so all the people you sent against me were sent out of love, to show me the errors of my ways? - No, to send this witch screaming to Hell and remove the curse that holds you. - Liar! (weapons clanking) (grunting) (growling) (dramatic ensemble music) (weapons clanking) (groaning) The devil's watching, Boar. This time, he'll have your soul. - No. You've become what you hate most, Barek. A Berserker. (growling) (grunting) (screaming) - [Brunhilda] Finish it, Barek. - Don't trust her, brother! - Kill him, Barek. - Odin! - Barek. (soft chanting) (growling) I knew you could do it, I knew you would win. You always win. - Always? - Every lifetime since I've found you, you have fought your brother and Odin's power, kept me free. You were right Barek, Odin made the rules and as long as I am with you, he cannot touch me. - So he sends Boar. - Who would never harm his brother and so lifetime after lifetime, Odin loses. - You used me. - No. (growl) I saved you. - Saved me? By turning me into the thing I dread the most, Berserker? It's not Odin's curse, it's yours. - A curse to live over and over for hundreds of lifetimes, thousands. To take the knowledge of the ages with you. - But I am Berserker, all I take are lives. All I bring to the future is death. - Yes. - Boar. He was right. He was telling the truth. All this time, you, you kept me alive to protect you from Boar. He came to kill you and to save me. - Boar, Boar came to take me back to Odin! (growling) And kill anything he can. - Boar! - No! (screaming) - [Barek] In return for a second chance for Boar, I relinquished my claim to Brunhilda. She was re-chained to the altar of Asgard where she would remain, screaming her rage at eternity. (growling) Boar was reborn into the Valkyrie's curse. He is all I have left of a family and a life which was stolen from me. The mistakes I made then I will not repeat now. Reunited as brothers, together we will face the future and fate of immortality.
