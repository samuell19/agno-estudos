- Here, stop here driver. - Here, mum? Not here, mum. This is no place for a lady like you. - Yes, please stop. Stop here. You must stop now! - As you wish, mum. That'll be six shills, please. I wouldn't mind waitin'. East End, no place for a lady like yourself. There'd be no extra charge, and I can wait, m'lady. - That won't be necessary. Good evening. - Thank you, mum. And good evening to ya. - Now, from that description, what famous crime is brought to mind? Mr. Patton. - Jack the Ripper. - Correct. See that's the kind of picture that's been painted in our minds by Hollywood. Kind of imagery that movie makers are so fond of using to manipulate history and make it more exciting. If you'll pardon the expression, more colorful than it actually was. It should come as no surprise to any of you that Hollywood often portrays historical events in a much more romantic light than was actually the case. And if you weren't aware of that before, you will be by the end of this course. As a matter of fact, there were several inaccuracies in the description I just gave you in Jack the Rippers' first murder. Which, by the end of the semester you should be able to pick out. Any questions? Yes, ma'am. - Well Hollywood makes movies about murders. We know that. But what about murderers imitating what they see in the movies? Has that ever happened? - Good question, and yeah it has. We'll cover that later in the course. It's the old question of art imitating life, life imitating art. Take a good look at that later on. Yes? - Um, did you hear about that murder downtown? It's the one they're comparing to Jack the Ripper? It's like this prostitute, um, you know she bought the farm, same kinda deal that um, that you're talking' about, um earlier. - Yeah, now that you mention it, I do remember. What's your name? - Brian. Brian. For those of you who didn't read about it, what Brian is referring to is a murder that took place over the weekend. Where a prostitute was killed by someone who slit her throat. From ear to ear. Police are calling that a modern day Jack the Ripper. Why do you suppose they're doing that, Brian? - I, don't know. - Yes. - Well, because Jack the Ripper like killed prostitutes. And when he did, he sliced their neck across here all the way across. And then he'd cut them up, just like this. Well that's how he did it. - Exactly. That was Jack's proclivity. Prostitutes. Looks like you could've been there. We're not only going to talk about Jack the Ripper. The name of this course is Famous Crimes. It's on your syllabus, but for the sake of redundancy I'll put it up here anyway. On Film. What we'll be doing is looking at a number of famous crimes. We'll take a look at the Brinks robbery, St. Valentine's Day massacre, um, Bluebeard, Leopold Loeb, and the White Chapel murders. Those actually committed by Jack the Ripper. We'll get a pretty solid account of each one based on what history tells us about it. Then we'll view one or more films based on the incident, and discuss how the crimes were portrayed by Hollywood. Yes, mam'am. - This may be a dumb question, but, - Young lady, there is one thing you will learn in my class. There are no dumb questions. - Okay, then who was Bluebeard? - You're joke... Oh, that's a dumb question. - He does that all the time, it's a big joke. - No, I'm sorry I'm kidding. Seriously, Bluebeard was a Frenchman named Landru who knocked off several wives. He collected them like some people collect stamps. We'll learn a lot more about him too. It's all right here in the text for this course. Leo Matlin's Crime Cinema. It's a must. And really good reading. Well, for those of you hoping for a short first class, I'm going to make your day. If there are no further questions, we'll see you all tomorrow. And one more thing. This is the first time the University has offered this course. It's sort of an experiment. Whether it is repeated or not, will depend a lot on you. And how good you make me look. So make me look good, okay? Hmm? Okay, we'll see you tomorrow. - It's gonna be an easy A, huh? - I think so, man. Let's go. - Goodbye. You must be a glutton for punishment. Two semesters in a row. - Hey, I can spot an easy A when I see one. - I see you managed to drag an accomplice along this time. - Oh, Cindy Blair, Professor Richard Harwell. - Hi, it's nice to meet you. - Same here. I suppose Steve has already told you about the University's automatic grade point inflater. Me. - Well, he told me I'd learn a lot about movies. - Well you know it's tough when one of your students thinks he knows more about the subject matter than you do. - Did you see House of Wax last night? - Last night, I thought it was tonight. - Nope. Last night. - Dammit, I wanted to tape it. - Well you can still catch Conqueror Worm tonight. - Wait, wait, Theater of Blood is on tonight. - No no, Theater of Blood's tomorrow night. Conqueror Worm's tonight, House of Wax was last night. - Does he always talk like this? - Yeah, most of the time. - See ya. - Bye. See, I told ya he was a neat professor. - Yeah, he is he's okay. - Okay, that's great kids, that's real good. That's what I wanna see. Uh, let's take it again from the top, but this time, relax and smile okay right? You all remember how to smile, yeah? Great let's do it again, this time full out.

You're supposed to take three weeks to do that. - There are some of us, Professor Harwell, unlike others of us who seem to feel that every minute of class time is valuable. - Oh. Mmm. - Oh that's good, that's my favorite flavor, fabric softener. - I'm sorry. That's better. - That's much better. My favorite flavor of human being, mm. - Um, Richard, Richard, no there's students please. - You ready for lunch? - I'm very ready for lunch. But, I want to show you something first. - Hey, students. - Oh, I forgot. Stop, see? - What? All I see is a room full of junk. - The headboard, silly, isn't it the most gorgeous brass headboard you've ever seen? C'mon, c'mon. I'd just love to sleep under this. Wouldn't it be great in my apartment? I always wanted a brass headboard. - It needs a little polishing. - I know, but imagine it all shined up and pretty and clean. Wouldn't it be great? I wonder if it's too expensive. - Ma'am, you wait here. I'll go rustle up some help. - Thank you. - May I help you? - Gosh, you startled me. - Did I? I'm sorry. I didn't hear you come in. Did the bell ring? - Yes, I think it did. - Mmm hmm. - Must be the hearing aid. Battery getting low I guess. Did you come after the brass headboard dear? - Yes ma'am. - I noticed you in here the other day. And once before, too. - That was me. So, how much do you want for it? - Oh, I just love this headboard. It should go to a nice couple like you. How long have you been married? - We're not married. - Yet. - Well, nevermind. Why don't you just go look around, and we girls will discuss price. If that's all right. - Yeah, go ahead, go have fun. - Just, look around. - Right. - Yes. - Sure. - Just make yourself at home. Now, what is your budget, dear? - Well, to tell you the truth, my budget is only about $50. And even at that I can't really afford all of it at once, but I just want it so badly. Maybe, maybe if I could pay you about, I don't know, $20 down first month, and pay you $10 every month after that until I get to $50 to pay you up. And, uh then that would work out just fine. I really want a headboard, it's so pretty. If we could work something out I'd be very grateful. - Hey, you ready? - Uh, yeah sure. - Isn't that an interesting ring? - Yes it is. - Uh, this doesn't look like you Richard. - An old man brought it in just this morning. He said he found it in an alley. I don't think I've ever seen one quite like that before. - It is different. - If you're interested in buying it, young man, I'll sell it to you for, oh, $50. - Uh, oh, you know thanks really. It, uh, it just caught my eye. - Well. - You getting the headboard? - I'm gonna think about it, um maybe after a few more paychecks? - That headboard was meant for you. You'll have it by my word. - I'll be back for it. - Oh, young man. If you change your mind about the ring, $50, it's a deal. It looks like 14 carat. - Thanks. - Bye bye. Yeah, what a salesman huh? - It's amazing what some people think is attractive. - Hi honey, it's me. I just called to tell you thanks for the great afternoon. And uh, I mean, I'd probably take the headboard if you gave it to me. See you later, bye bye. - Hmm. - Mr. Harwell, Steve Patton. Just called to remind you about Conqueror Worm. Comes on in about 15 minutes. It's about a quarter to eight right now. Hope you don't miss it. - Hello? - Mr. Harwell, Steve Patton again. I see you're home. - Yes sir. - Did you get my message? - As a matter of fact, I'm watching Conqueror Worm right now. - Good. Well, I didn't want you to miss it, you know after last night. Hey, no problem. Enjoy the flick. Thanks. - Who was that? - Oh, uh, telling him about the movie. You know this is a great home cooked meal you made. - I tried really hard. You mean that was Professor Harwell? - Yeah, we're old buds. - He doesn't mind you calling him up at home? - No, he's an old movie buff like me. Did this take you a while to cook? - No, I just whipped it up, you know, microwave. - No, you didn't come close to the microwave. - You sure he doesn't mind? - No, he doesn't mind at all. - Very nice of you to call. - This is a good movie. It's got Vincent Price. It's kinda corny, but you'll like it. - I think I'll go take a bath. You could be in here for a while. - No, you'll miss the movie. - But see, you're taping it all. I'll watch it later, I promise. - No you won't. Again, just like the other movie. - You're right I won't, but see you spoil everything for me when you tell me how they do the effects. - No I don't. I never do that. - Yes you do. - No I don't, go take a bath. - You do it all the time. No, for real even, I want you to know that, you do do that all the time. - No I don't, go take a bath. - Yes you do. You know where I'll be. - Yeah. Call me if you need anything. Human washrag, bar of soap... What a cook. The power of the ray, and we could deflect it to the chemical bath, right when the Worm gets there, it will cause it to crystallize! - Right. How about it General? - Well, I guess it's worth a try. Okay, Paul, you and Ju wait for me in the convoy truck. And I'll get the professor to deflect the ray. Colonel? - Yes, General? - Well, you heard the man. What are you waiting for? - I'm on my way, General. Major, I'll need B Company to canvass that area before we get there. Have your men load the deflection gear as the 21st in the water. I'll give you the coordinates as soon as you arrive. Get the professor on the horn, he's got to boost that worm... - Who are you? What do you want from me? Quit doing this to me! What do you want with me? Get away! Stay away from me! - Great, wasn't it? - Yes, uh... - Do you believe those effects? Weren't they great? - Uh, hello. I must have dozed off. - Dozed off? During Conqueror Worm? C'mon, Mr. Harwell. - Listen, Steve, I gotta go. See you tomorrow. - See ya in class. Great movie. - Is that Professor Harwell again? - Yeah. - Steve, you're sure he doesn't mind you calling him this late? - No, I told ya. We're old buds. Don't you look nice. - Shit. Hello. - Hi, you okay? - Oh, hi I thought it was one of my students. This guy's been calling me all night. - Sorry, I didn't mean to bother you. - No, no no problem. How are you? - I'm fine. Did you get my message? - Yeah I did. I had fun too. Thanks. - I was just sittin' here thinking about you. Um, I'm sorry I called so late. Hope you don't mind. - Have you ever heard me complain in five years? - No, I don't think I ever remember you complaining about anything. - You know I was thinking about you too. - Oh you were? - Yeah, a little while ago I had the strangest dream. - What dream? Tell me about it. - Well, I don't know if I should. - C'mon, you can tel me. - Really, I don't know you might not like it. - I don't think there's anything about you that I don't like. - Well, it was a nightmare. - A nightmare? - Yeah, something to do with the theater and your students. And in the end, you got killed by a slasher, or, Jack the Ripper. - Richard, you just watch too many of those horror movies. - Yeah, but that's not the worst part. I was the one who killed you. - Richard! - You, missed the movie. - So what. - To the bed? - How about the couch? - How about the couch. This may be better than the movie. - You sure are sweet tonight. - Yeah, so are you. I was right. This is a lot better than the movie. - You always gonna be like this? - You'll see. - That's Jack the Rapper. He's an okay dude. He'd kill his own mother. Just to get some food. - Whenever you're finished, Brian. - Walkin' the beat. - Hi. - Where you been? - I had a little trouble getting up this morning. Thanks to you. - Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Today, as promised, we begin our study of crime in the cinema. With a look at perhaps the most famous series of murders ever committed. The White Chapel murders. Those committed by Jack the Ripper. I say they are perhaps the most famous, because more than any other series of crimes in history that I know of, the White Chapel murders have been the subject of many many films. Especially in the British cinema. So, we'll start with the most popular. The White Chapel murders all took place between August 31st and November nine, 1888. In all, Jack the Ripper is alleged to have committed 14 murders. The key word there is alleged. Although as many as 14 killings were at times attributed to Jack, if we may become that familiar, It's commonly agreed upon that only five were actually his work. The others may have been copycat killings. There are many theories as to who Jack was, and why he committed the murders. Hollywood has been great at supplying us with those through the years, and we'll look at some of them later on. But for now, these are the facts. Each victim was a prostitute. Each victim had her throat slit. And, each victim was savagely mutilated and usually disemboweled. That means her insides were carved out. In one case, a police said Jack wrote to them that he had fried and eaten one of his victim's kidneys. - He sent the other one to them in the note to prove it. As a matter of fact, Jack wrote several notes to the police. They were all very glib and related to his progress. In one he told of how a victim squealed a bit, so he had to rush the job and escape before being discovered. Welcome back to Earth, Brian. Wanna get that? Jack's last victim was a woman named Mary Jane Kelly. With her murder, his trail vanished, and his identity remains a mystery to this day. For which countless novelists and screenwriters have been eternally grateful. Yes. - Uh, did you hear about the murders last night? The police are saying that it's another Jack the Ripper. - No, what murder? - Some lady was cut up in the theater. And just like you said, her guts were ripped out. You think it's a copycat killing? - Yeah, yeah I think so. Jack himself was last heard from over 100 years ago. There have probably been hundreds of Jack imitators over the years with all the publicity his killings have gotten. But what's really fascinating about him is all the speculation as to his identity. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle hypothesized that the murders weren't committed by a man at all, but rather by a deranged midwife. Hence the disemboweling of the victims. My favorite theory comes from a recent film called Murder by Decree. It says that Jack was actually a Royal Physician. And a Freemason sworn to protect the monarchy. He killed prostitutes in order to abort the bastard child of I believe the Prince of Wales. It's a great Sherlock Holmes film starring James Mason and Christopher Lee. - Christopher Plummer. Plummer. - Yes I believe it was Christopher Plummer. Thank you. And then, there is this book. I haven't read it yet, but it takes the cover up theory a step further. Claiming that there was crucial evidence found at the scene of Mary Jane Kelly's murder that as part of the cover up was lost and never heard from again. Except as rumor. It's called the Ripper Conspiracy. And... Uh, well as I say, I haven't read it yet but it's supposed to be the latest thing on the subject. Any questions? Good. Now if you'll all be quiet so as not to disturb Mr. Stodd, I'll give you another short class today. As long as you read at least one book on the White Chapel murders. We'll meet again on Friday and view The Lodger an early Hitchcock film about Jack. - So, quiet now. And uh, good day. Class dismissed Brian. Hi. - Can I help you? - Um, - Oh! You came back for the brass headboard. - Yes. Ah, actually no. It's gone it's not here. - I beg your pardon? Well, it's right where it's always been. - The ring. It's not here. - Oh, you came back for the ring. What is it with that ring? - What do you mean? - Well, ever since that ring came in here, everybody wants it. And then, they don't want it. - They what? - Just after you left yesterday, a woman came in, bought it, paid $50 for it, said it was just perfect for her husband, and this morning the husband brings it back. Said it was bad luck or something. I gave him their money back. - Well where is it now? - Well I sold it. I almost sold it. - Almost sold it? - Well I promised a lady that I'd hold it for her until noon. - You mean you have it in the store now? - Yes. - May I see it? - I don't see why not. - I don't see what is so special about this ring. - I really wouldn't know. - Uh, how much did you say that lady was going to give you for the ring? - $50. - All right, well I have $100 cash. May I have it? - Well I really couldn't do that. - Why not this is $100 cash. - Honey, it's not the money. It's the principle. I promised her I'd hold it until noon, and I must keep my word. You can't stay in business if you go back on your word. - Well look it's a couple minutes to 12 now. - I tell ya, I'll sell it to you at noon if she doesn't come back. In the meantime, why don't you just browse around, make yourself at home. I'll show you that headboard again if you like. - No, thanks. - It'd be better if you invested your money in that headboard. It sure would impress your fiance'. - Thanks. - Uh huh. Well hello Mrs. Pratt. - Hello, is it ready? - Yes it is. - Uh, excuse me. - Yes? - Oh I, uh, I thought I knew you from somewhere. - Oh really, from where? - Um, you just look familiar that's all. - Oh, well I used to work at the Red Cross, I met a lot of people that way all over the country. I used to travel to fairs and exhibitions and help run first aid centers and, and I gave first aid instruction and all. Do you know what the first disaster was that the Red Cross worked? - Uh, no. - The big San Francisco earthquake. - Oh! - In 19, uh, what? - That will be $120 exactly. - One hundred and twenty dollars. All right. Here it is! Oh, isn't it beautiful? - Yes. Oh don't you want me to put it in a box? - I know I'll just take it right like this. - Oh Mrs. Pratt, your receipt. - Oh I've got the clock, I don't need a receipt. - All right then. - Oh thank you. - All right you come back. - Oh I will. - All right. - It's 12:00. - Oh, it's, that ring, where did I put that? Oh, here it is. Colonial Antiques. Yes, yes I've got it right here. - Shit. - Oh, well I'm glad you called. Yes I have a young man right here that wants to buy it. Yes, uh, oh. I see, fine. Yes, all right. Goodbye. It's yours, $50. - Honey it's me, give me a call about 7 if you get a chance. I've got us some good news. Bye, love you. - Uh, Richard, Patty here, from Psychology. Did you read the paper this morning? There's been another knife murder. Police are calling it another Jack the Ripper type. I, um, thought that was interesting since you're teaching Jack the Ripper and all. Richard, I don't know how to tell you this, but I hear weird things in the administration and I don't know what to think exactly. It's big news, they've already had a meeting. They thought the killer might be a student of yours, so I just thought someone should tell ya so it wouldn't come as a complete surprise to ya. Bye. - Discovery of a 10 carat Baroque. Baroque. - I'll see you guys tomorrow night, okay? Bye. - Shit. - Oh, hi. - You okay? - Oh, sure. - Why wouldn't you answer the phone? I've been calling all night. - What time is it? - 11:15. Did you get my message? - Yeah, I got it, uh, call at seven. I must have dozed off. - Dozed off. You dozed off for over four hours? Some nap. I was really afraid something had happened to you when you wouldn't answer all night. - I haven't been sleeping very well lately. - Yeah, obviously to give up one of my Italian dinners. - Mama mia! - Richard, don't tease me. I'm really angry. Especially when I thought maybe you'd found something more interesting to do like um, watch tv. - Dammit. I missed taping Theater of Blood tonight. That's twice this week! - Geez, I don't believe it. You stand me up, all night long, and now all you're really worried about is missing some stupid slasher movie on tv. - Hey, Carol, c'mon give me a break. I said I was sorry. Okay? Okay? Hey, you are not going to believe what happened to me. Right now we're studying Jack the Ripper. And I came across this book. - Go on I'm listening. - Uh, it's a book with a theory. - You okay? - Yeah, uh, forget it it's no big deal. Hey. I really am sorry. About tonight. - So, are you uh, still hungry? Let me make you something to eat real fast. - No, no I'm not hungry. - Are you sure you're okay? - Yeah, yeah I'm fine, really. Hey, you uh, do you wanna get together tomorrow night to, uh make up for tonight? - Yeah, that's the least you can do. - Okay. - What are you doing? - Making some coffee. - Oh, not for me I hope. - Yes for you, it'll do you some good. - Oh Carol I don't need more then I'll be up all night. - I'm sorry I jumped on you. I was just worried. - Jump on me anytime you like. - You don't give up, do you? - Nope. - Richard. - Sorry. You got a hangover? - No, I slept miserably last night. I don't know what it is. - Hey, I've got a great telephone joke if you wanna hear it. - Sure. - Okay. You call up the bowling alley, and you say "excuse me sir do you uh, "have 12 pound balls?" And he says "well yeah, sure." And you say "I bet you have a hard time "puttin' your pants on." - Is there a point to this little visit? Hmm, mm hmm? - Did you hear about the murder last night? - No what murder? - Down on Brookside. Cocktail waitress got killed as she was getting in her car after work. They're calling it another Jack the Ripper job. Talk about gruesome, pulled her insides out, and threw 'em on her. - Really? - Yeah. You know, it's kinda weird having a Jack the Ripper in our town after all these years killing people. - Yeah well that Brookside's such a circus I'm not surprised. - If you really think about it, it all started three days ago. Same day our class began. Talk about coincidence. - I'd rather not. Thanks. - Hey, I found out something interesting. You know yesterday you told us to ready a book about the murders? Look. - That's a people's almanac. - Mmm hmm. Yup. Look, look at this. Famous left handed people. Harpo Marx, Judy Garland, Charlie Chaplan, - Leonardo DaVinci, Paul McCartney, Jack the Ripper. - Interesting, that bit of information had eluded me. Now maybe I can sleep tonight. Really, Steve a people's almanac? - Hey, uh, nice ring. That new? - I can't get the damn thing off. - Sorry. Hey will you sign something for me real quick? - Sure. What are you dropping? - I'm not dropping. I'm adding your Steinbeck course. - You realize that's next semester. - Yeah. I wanna beat the rush. - Yeah, right. - Thanks. See you Friday. - See ya, Steve. - Bye. - 12 pound balls? - Knock it off! - Uh huh, oh, this is great. Watch this. Here we go. C'mon it's so real. - Think? - Ah, I don't wanna watch it. Oh, gosh. What now? Is she gonna get murdered? - No, no nothin' like that. - Gross. Gosh! Wait a minute, what is that? - What? - That ring! Did you go back to the store and get that ring? - No, no I bought that on campus the other day from some guy. - Some guy, huh, what's his name? - I don't know I never met him before. - Let me see. You went back to the store and got the ring didn't you? - Yeah, okay I did. - I didn't think you liked jewelry. God, that's so gaudy! - Yeah, it is. But it's interesting, too. - I guess, here let me see. - Ah, ahh! - Wow it won't come off. - Yeah I know. - Take it off I wanna see it. - I can't it won't come off. - Richard, I'm serious I wanna see if it fits on my fingers. - I swear it won't come off! You think I'd be wearing the damn thing if I could get it off? - Well, uh... That's kinda weird. Why would you go back to the store and get that ring if... Richard Harwell you are a strange bird, you know that? - K well that's why all the women are crazy about me. - Okay, just just hush and kiss me before I have the time to think about it though. Mm hmm. Now watch the movie. Oh God! - Yeah! - You gotta be kiddin' me. This is ridiculous. - Look, look, look! - Oh, it's squirtin' all over! - Shh, shh, shh, shh. This, this thing is good, look at this. I got some friends in this one. That guy right there, they call him potato head. - What was that? Pizza ready? - Pizza? Hey, silly, hey it's about time for me to get going. - Oh you can't do that. We gotta watch the rest of the movie. - You mean the one that ended about an hour ago? - Ended? - Yeah, about an hour ago. - Dammit, I did it again. - Hey, it's okay don't worry. You're just all wound up from the, the new semester and your new class, all that good stuff. You'll get over it. Get a good nights sleep tonight and we'll have a great time tomorrow. - But that's just it, I can't get a good nights sleep. I can't get rested up, my system's all screwed up. I doze off in the evening, I wake up, stay awake all night long. I don't now what's happening to me. - Maybe it's uh, early menopause. - Dammit, honey, I'm not kidding. - I'm sorry. Hey, hey I didn't mean to be so cruel.

Watch nobody be home now. - Hello? Hello, hello dad? - Uh, Jenny is that you? - Yeah. Is Mike there? - Uh, is something wrong darling? - No, no I'm okay. I just ran out of gas. I wanna know if Mike can come and pick me up. - I got some time, I can come do it. - No, no just go get Mike. I'll wait. - Okay, hold on. - Shoot. Can't believe this, can't believe it. just can't believe this. - Jenny? Mike's on his way. Hello? Hello? Jenny? Jenny? Hello? Hello Jenny? - It's The Joys of a Woman. - No, the answer is Emmanuelle 2. Give me 'em up. - Like hell! I worked at the theater where it played. It was Emmanuelle the Joys of a Woman. I saw it six times. - But that's not what the card says, and this is what we're going by. - Right, okay okay. Okay fine. Disqualify that card, ask me another one. - I don't think so. If you have a complaint, you write the company. We're going by what the card says, Steve. - Excuse me. Jeez. How nice are you? You're very nice. Go ahead. Hey Professor Harwell, look look look look look. - Hi, Steve. Look. Okay, alright. Entertainment, cards got the wrong answer on it, she says I'm wrong. Just read that. - He does this all the time. - Tell her who's right. - That's the right answer, Emmanuelle 2. - See, I told you. - No it's not! You feelin' okay? - Yeah, I'm fine, look, I'm in a hurry, Steve I'll see you later. Bye bye. - Cya. - Bye. - You really shouldn't go around doing things like that, Steve. - Did you notice his ring? - His? No. - The big one, on his left hand. - No. - It's just like the one that was found at the scene of Jack the Ripper's last murder. Look. - Steve, I didn't get a good look at it. - Believe me. He was wearing it on his left hand. You remember Harwell being left handed? - I never noticed, but so what. - I've known him more than a year and I never remember him being left handed. Boom, suddenly he's left handed? Yesterday, yesterday he signed an add form for me with his left hand. - Hmm. - Just then he took that card in his left hand. - So, what? I don't. - Jack the Ripper was left handed. - No, no seriously - C'mon, Steve. - Now here's a guy, who's always been right handed. - Mmm hmm. - He buys a ring, puts it on his left hand, and suddenly he's left handed? A ring that looks just like one that was found a hundred years ago on a Ripper victim? To me that's pretty strange. - I think you've seen too many weird movies. - No! - Cmon let's finish the game! - Don't you think it's strange, especially with all these murders going on? - No, actually I think you're trying to get out of the game because you're losing. - No, seriously! Don't you think it's strange? - I think you're strange. Aw, c'mon. Lose the game gracefully or we won't go parking tonight. - Parking? - You heard me, ask me a question. - You win. - You're just going to forfeit just like that? - That's it. Darn the luck, I lose let's pack it up. - Okay. - I love that song. - So do I. Let's dance. - No, let's not. Mmm, whoah buddy give me some air okay? - Okay, relax - Let's go for a walk. - Time out. Mr. Cool, you know. Time out, doing my best work. - Jeez. Oh! - Don't you just happen to be bad? - I do not. You're not even... It's beautiful out here. - Yes. Just like you. - Cutie. Not bad yourself. - Well, you know. So I hope you know all this studying is really going to help my grade point. - Yeah. What a way to go. Look over there. - Yeah. - We should go pretty soon, though there's a curfew. - Oh we should go. We're over 18. - I don't want to get in trouble. - What the hell is life without a little danger? - I just don't want to get in trouble. - I'll protect you. - Okay. - Worry wart. - Alrighty. - Wanna go for a walk? - Yeah, c'mon. - What's that? - What? You know I never knew you were such a good dancer. - There's a lot of things you don't know about me. - Like what? - Like... - Like what? - I'll figure somethin' out. - What? - Let me show you something. - Steve, wait a minute what are you doing? - C'mere. - You're gonna drop me. - C'mere. - Put me, put me down. - No I'm not, c'mere. - Steve, put me down. - How much you eat today? Look, when we get married, we gotta have a little spring. - Are we gonna need a house for that? - What house? - Okay. - I would build it right here. What do you think? - You cleared this with the Parks Department, right? - Oh don't worry about the Parks Department. I'll take care of that. And this could be the living room, and you walk in to the den, and then the kitchen. And you could cook here. You gotta move this rock. What do you think of this? - I think it's great but the Parks guys might not go for it. - Oh, forget about the Parks guys. That's just the first floor. - Mmm. - Second floor we could have the kids room. - Kids? - Yeah. We gotta make that bigger. - Lots of kids, well.. - You're gonna have some kids, right? - Yeah, I think. - We're gonna get married. - Is that the only reason - Yeah that's it. - You'd marry me? - Dad's here. Kids. Okay, next to the kids room - Oh. - You gotta have a bath. - Uh, huh. - Right? - Cuz that's - That's logical. - That's okay, good. Oh, and then comes our room. With a big ol' waterbed. Stand back. Mirrors on the ceiling, we could look at ourselves. Silk sheets, I think I'm in heaven. It could be our dream house. What do you think? Cindy? Cindy don't hide from me, I'm not in the mood. Cindy? Cindy I swear when I find you I'm gonna... Cindy? Cindy where are you? Cindy? Cindy. Cindy where are you? Cindy? Cindy. Come here. Cindy? Cindy... Oh God, Cindy! Noooooo! Wait, hurry he's gettin' away! - Wait a minute! - He killed my girlfriend! He's gettin' away! - Who killed who? - Forget it! C'mon he went down there! - Yeah, I saw him. You just stay right here. - He's on foot! Let's go! - No, stay here! - No, we gotta go he's gettin' away! - Who are you anyway? - Steve Patton. That's the Ripper, the one that's been killin' all the girls! He killed my girlfriend back there And now he's gettin' away! - Now son, listen to me. Settle down. I've gotta go get some help, we'll go check on your girlfriend, you stay right here. - He's gettin' away! - Now will you sit right here, you promise me? - No, he's... Answer me! You gonna stay right here? - Yes. - All right, you stay right here. - We got a homicide suspect on foot. - Uh, his, His first film, however was The Lodger. Made in 1926. It was a silent film, and was remade twice. As a talkie in 1932, and again in 1944. It was also the first film in which Hitchcock made one of his famous cameo appearances, because they didn't have enough extras. And now as far as I know, the film you're about to see is the first cinematic representation of the White Chapel murder mystery. Many more of course would follow through the years, including a number of television shows. Including one on, uh, Twilight zone, and another on Star Trek, entitled, uh, "The Man Trap". - "Wolf In the Fold". - What was that? - Wasn't it Wolf In the Fold? That was the episode on Star Trek that was about Jack the Ripper. - Yeah, uh, I'm sorry you're right. Uh, Wolf In the Fold. Anyway. What makes the White Chapel murders so appealing to writers is the fact that they were never solved. The murderer was never apprehended. And so, that's been the springboard for a great many ideas. Well, I have an appointment in about five minutes, and that should do it for introductions. Steve? Uh, Brian if you could put your friend down, get the lights and the VCR, I'll see you when the film's finished. - Cool. - Oh, hi. - Hi. I'm glad, I'm glad you could meet with me. - No problem, no problem, um, I don't even have a class until 11, but, uh, let's, let's walk real quick. - Sure, sure, fine. - So, uh, what's on your mind? - Those knife murders. - They talked to ya, huh? - No. Fred, Fred. The one last night was one of my students. She was with her boyfriend. He's in my class too. - The one in the phone booth? - No no that was the night before. Last night was in the park. - There was another one? - Do you read the papers? - Is that what you wanted to talk to me about? - No, yeah, well, listen, you teach Abnormal Psychology don't you Fred among other things? - Mmm hmm. So what do you wanna know? - Well, they're comparing this to Jack the Ripper. What I'm wondering is, do you think this guy is an imitator, or do you think he really believes he is Jack the Ripper? - Could be either one. - Oh. - You say the girl last night was with her boyfriend in the park? - Yeah. - And as I remember, another was a cocktail waitress, and uh... I'd say the guy thinks he's Jack. - Why? - Well, if he were an imitator, chances are he wouldn't know enough about him to imitate him to a T. But, if he's operating under the delusion that he actually is Jack the Ripper, well, he'd do everything Jack would have done. Uh, an imitator wouldn't necessarily be on the ball enough to make the distinction. - I see. - On the other hand, care for some coke? - Uh, no thanks. - On the other hand, uh, depending upon the guy's psychological makeup, here would you hold this for me? - Sure. - Thanks, and uh, that uh, I think this book on Freud, here. has what I'm - Ah. - Looking for. - Okay. - I got it. Let's see here. I found it earlier. Yeah, yeah yeah yeah. See, see that? That's what a Victorian prostitute looked like. Hmm. - So? - So? Look around. Ah hah! - Yeah, but, what about his methods? Why would he mutilate them so? - Well, it depends on if you're talking about the current murderer, because that's the way Jack did it. If you're talking about Jack himself, could be any one of a number of reason. - Such as? - Oh, such as, uh, a mother hate thing, uh, massive inferiority complex, uh, religious mania. Or quite the opposite. It could be some type of occultic thing. - Occultic? - Yeah, yeah. Ritualistic killings, and mutilations, usually disembowelment. - For what purpose? - Power, immortality, soul transference. - Yeah but Fred. - Fred! - Huh? - How prevalent was all that back in the Victorian era? - The more severe the society, the more extreme the other side of the coin. - That so? - Uh huh, uh huh. Well take prohibition for example. It was a gangsters heyday, and you'd be surprised how much occultic activity was going on. - Ah! To hell with ya. - Hello? - Hi, honey, just calling to let you know I'm on my way. - Well that was sweet of you. Hey, you made me a very happy girl. You'll never guess what arrived today. - Let me see... Is it, round and shiny and sticks so far out of your bed that you could hang a hat on it? - You're a doll, Richard, you really shouldn't have. Oh I love it! So does this mean we're, uh, tying the knot now that we have our own brass headboard? - Ahhh, well, I'm dying to see what it looks like in your bedroom. Be ready in 20 minutes? - Uh, in 20 minutes? I'll try. See ya later, bye bye. - Ah! Hi, honey, it's me. Battery's dead in the Porsche again. Can you pick me up? - Yeah, I guess so. - I'll just wait here for you, allright? - I'm not ready yet, um, it's going to take a few minutes. - Well, I'm not going anywhere. - Okay bye. - Bye. Steve, what are you doing here? - I need to talk to you. - Uh, look this is really not a good time. - Can I come in? - Sure why not, Steve? Come right in. I was sorry as hell to hear about your girlfriend, Steve. - I was with her, you know. - I know. - We were going to get married. I heard that. God, I'm sorry Steve. - I really loved her. And like that, she's gone. You know what that does to someone? - I can imagine. - Can you? - Hey look, Steve, let me get you a drink or something. - I don't want a drink! I wanna talk to you. - Ok, so sit down, we'll talk. - I don't wanna sit down! I wanna talk to right here! - Okay I'm all ears. So talk. - I wanna talk to you because... I think you're the Ripper. I think you killed Cindy. - Me? - The ring. You know about the ring. - Yeah, I know about the ring. - I wanna see your leg. Show me your leg. - What are you talking about? - Show me your leg! - Hey, hey. Look, Steve, now there's no need for that. Put the gun away. - Your left leg! The Ripper fell on his left leg, now let me see your left leg! - Settle down. I didn't kill your girlfriend. I'm not the Ripper, I never killed anybody. - Show me your leg! Professor Harwell. Why? - Steve, that's been there a long time. Look, I never killed anybody. Now, let's call the Police. - No! The ring. What about the ring? - I bought it as a joke, now it won't come off that's all! - No. You know that Jack the Ripper owned the ring. - Steve, that's speculation, that's some writer's theory, that's not a fact! Now give me the gun. - No. You killed them. - Steve, look at me. - I never killed anybody. Now I've got a date coming over in a couple of minutes. Why don't you give me the gun? - You still going out with the dance teacher? - Yeah I am, now give me the gun! - Hello? - Carol, Carol Hastings, do you date Professor Harwell at the University? - Yeah. - Do you have a date with him tonight? - Who is this? - Don't meet him. Don't go out with him he's going to kill you. - Who, who is this? - He killed my girlfriend and he killed those other girls too. And now he's going to kill you. - Is this some kind of a joke? - It's no joke, I swear it! He's the Ripper. And you're his next victim. Stupid. - Richard? Richard? Richard? Richard? Richard, what are you doing in here? C'mon, let's go eat, okay? Honey? Richard? Don't do this to me! Oh my God, who are you? - Uh, moi? Uh. I should think that would be obvious. Though, considering that people have been asking me that question for the last 100 years, hearing it again hardly surprises me. - Where's Richard? What have you done with Richard? - Richard? Richard? Richard? Richard? You have no idea. Like any intelligent man, I do enjoy the occasional challenge. However I am not of the temperament tonight to put up with any more of this cat and mouse game! - Ah! - Zipper five to dispatch. Request backup at 12 North Vancouver. - Uh! - Though I'm sure there are many people that believe that I kill for mere pleasure, I assure you that's not the case. Like any good hunter, I kill to sustain my existence. And had it been known that roguery is a practice common to mortals, perhaps I would not have achieved immortality quite so eagerly. You see, my dear, immortality exacts a handsome price. Both for those who must claim it, and those who must pave the way. I can be, not without honor. I do have a conscience, you know. I initially took the vise of those that society would miss the least. - Uh! - Waifs. The misbegotten. The misfits. The derelicts. But as time progresses, I find it increasingly difficult to make the distinction. Therefore, I do apologize, but I must take your life. - Help. - But too many times I have been stopped short of my goal. I have been hindered in my quest. But tonight, tonight this very night, you, are the only thing that stands between me, and permanent release from the void that has been my prison for the better part of this last century. If I fail, I may have to wait another 100 years before fate presents me with an escape. Don't... - Ah! Fight it. You have... - Uh! A great honor. This is your night. This is the night, that you, release me. From my mortal coils. - Let her go! Go ahead, drop the knife! Let her go! - Young man! You can't kill me. You can kill her, but you can't kill me. - Ah! - Ahhhhhhhhhh! - He's the Ripper! He's in there get him! Get him it's the Ripper! - Kill him! Don't let him get the ring on! You can't kill him when he does! Kill him! Kill him! - Get him, please, get him he's the Ripper! - Easy, there. - Don't let him get the ring on! It's Jack the Ripper! The Ripper! The murderer! Kill him! - Ahhhhhhhh! - No, it's the wrong man! - Take him out! - Don't shoot! - Ah! - No, it's the wrong man! Don't shoot! - Kill him! - No! Oh Richard! Oh! - Hey, what's that? - Oh, neat something shiny! - Wow it's a ring! - Hey, it's kinda neat! - Looks kinda weird. - Let me see it. - No, I want it. - I think mom might like it. - Let's bring it home to her. - Nah, she won't want it. - Let's give it to her as a present. C'mon! - Oh, okay.
