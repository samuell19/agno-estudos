Did you hear me? I said, listen both of you! This is really quite simple: you saw how the robber dropped the balloon and ran off and she was crying. What are you staring at? Listen to me! If she can listen, so can you, eh? Well now, she's crying because of that and you're sorry for her. You're the hero now, all eyes are on you. Will you listen to me? You're the hero now and you go and get the balloon back for her. There! Is Mojca ready? Yes, yes. She can go! I'll put on the tears before the take. Right. -Matic! Matic!

Are you scared, or what? Don't worry, those two are down there to make sure nothing goes wrong. Wrong? -Jump kid, jump! I'll get my hands on him, that actor! Let's go! -I want to watch. Is the water deep enough? -Of course. More than deep enough. What's up now, Matic? Are you going to jump or aren't you? Are you scared, or what? I've jumped from higher than this, but my mother won't let me. Assistant! -What? -What's the matter now? Why doesn't he jump?! Where did you get him from? You have to jump down there? You've got guts! They're there because of me. -Flash bet a coca cola that you don't dare. -That I don't dare? -That's what he said. What is it, Matic? You know, I didn't expect this of you. You acted do brave- And now, eh? Rok! Go down a bit, you'll see better. -Good luck Matic! He'll jump... he'll jump. -Good. We can shoot. Where's the little girl, bring her over here! Now cry!

No, I'd rather have chocolate. For the dog, of course, what else. -Listen, sell me that dog, will you? This one? -Yes, that one. -Oh, I wanted to keep him for myself. Come on, what's one dog to you? -You think so? Of course. Look how crazy he is about that dog. You're my best friend. Remember that, Jacob! Matic, come here. Go on, come here! Would you like to have Jacob, eh? Or don't you want him? -Me? Jacob? For good? -For good, yes. Oh, hey! -Thank you! -Good, good, good.... Tra ra ra ray, Golden is this day, Run into it with me!

Mommy, this is Jacob! Isn't he beautiful? -Yes, he is... Jacob, Jacob! Say hello to Mommy. Go on: Hi! Matic, is it all over? -Yes. Isn't he beautiful? Yes, beautiful. You know how he scared me! Get changed, we're going to aunt Molly's. -Jacob's going with us. What do you mean, Jacob? -He's mine, don't you believe me? The film people gave him to me. -How do you mean, gave him? How he jumped into the water after me. Everybody admired us. That was something. -Oh dear, Matic! I'm not saying anything, he's nice, this Jake. -This is no Jake, his name's Jacob. Well, Jacob then. But look, Matic, where are we to keep him? -With me. Oh no, we used to have a dog and it left hair all over the place. My mother used to spend hours on end cleaning up after him. See, you had a dog, but I'm not allowed one. But do try to understand, Matic. We lived in the country and we had a big garden too. -And because we live in the city I can't have him? Then why can aunt Molly have one and the Vilhars and the Stares. -Yes. But they have little dogs, not enormous beasts like this. -You just admit it. You don't like him. You see, Jacob, she doesn't like you. It's not that I don't like him, but... If that's what you want, make a choice: who's it to be, me or him? Go on, tell me! Well, and you say whom you love more, daddy or me? Go on, tell me! Oh, you clever little rascal! -You've got no idea how much I love you. I'll get fleas. One, two, two, one, one, two.... Actor have dog, a movie dog. -Roaring Bull not in war paint! Oh, I'll get dressed, I just wanted to tell you that he's got that big black beast. -For good? Indians too have dogs. Only find name for him. See, this is your door, remember that. This is where you live, you understand? Seventh floor. When I say, Jacob home, you come here, that clear? Up here, hop, Jacob! Hop, hop, hop! Good boy, good boy! See the chocolate? Up here, hop! Hop! -What's up? -Oh, Rok. You're shouting as if everyone was deaf. You know, he can find his own way home! -No. He can, I'm telling you. You've never seen a dog as friendly as this. Just hold him. Don't be scared. Put him into the elevator. Then hide round the corner and watch. Now don't let me down. Matic! Matic! Home Jacob! Look out Rok, he's coming. Mom, will you give me five bucks so I can buy some Jacob feeding bowls? Matic, what happened? What did you do to dr. Grm? Oh yes... I was teaching Jacob how to come home. And what were you doing at the doctor's? -Nothing. Jacob mistook the floor. It's happened to me too. -They called the doctor, you know. Well, if she's hysterical. -Wow can you talk like that. You'll have to go and apologize nicely. If you don't look after him, I'll give him back to the trainer. Oh, the Indians are back again... Jacob, Jacob, heel. See how he obeys. Gee, what a big dog. I'm going to look at him. -Me too. Is he yours? -Mine, yes. What's his name? -Jacob. Like that teacher's. -Gee, he looks angry. Is he fierce? Of course not. -How black he is. And what a long tongue he has. Can he swim? -Can he play basketball? -He can, and lots of other things too. Do you think he really can? -You can't tell, we haven't tried yet. Hand over the ball! Show us what you can do, Jacob. Look out for your back! Boy is he good. Bravo, bravo Jacob! -He can really play. Come on, Jacob! Cover! Cover! Damn. Who broke the window? Well, who did it? Do I have to come down? Who broke the window? -Jacob. Jacob, Jacob! -Who's Jacob? -The dog. I'll give you a dog. Whose is the ball? -His. -Mine. Well you just tell your mother to come to me to get it. Please sir, I broke the window. It was an accident. I'll speak to your mother myself. Now beat it, get out of my sight. I'm on night shift, Christ! Do you know, I'm scared? -I'll say I broke the window. That'll be great. You don't understand. My mother doesn't like dogs. What about the money? -I'll persuade her somehow. You're a great guy. His name will be Dingo, the desert dog. Quiet Jacob, sit! He's not going to be any Dingo, he'll stay Jacob, just as he is. -I big chief of the Apaches.... You can be, for all I care, I'm not Playing Indians any more! Good bye! You can count me out too! -Why don't you want to play any more? White dog, I take scalp, take all scalps! What do you think you are, just because you've got that dog? Think I'm scared of him. Look at the bastard.... He'll bite you. No! -No! I'll have your scalp. Don't, Jacob! Damn! Now I'm in for it. -Did you see, he was defending me... Is that you, Rok? Rok? Stupid, if you've come to make fun of me you can just beat it! I told you, Nelly, scram! I'm no Nelly, good-bye. -Wait, Milena, I didn't know it was you. -But I promised I'd come to see Jacob. Why don't you open up? -It's all your fault. You see, and we can't get out. -What did you say? Aw, nothing. Damn. -All right, I'm going. -Wait! Well then at least open the door. -I'm not allowed to. Jacob's being punished because he bit Black Flash. -Well then lock him in the bedroom. It's not that easy. You're waiting for Neli, I know. What did you say? -That stupid cow. Are you crazy? All right, then I'm going. -Wait, Milena. I haven't got the key. Mommy's locked me in. You've got no idea what a fuss there was because of those six stitches, his mother behaved as if he'd been swallowed by a crocodile. And you won't be allowed out in the afternoon either? -I don't know. You know, mommy and I met the assistant. He bought us an ice cream. I was so embarrassed, because he asked how my boyfriend was... What boyfriend? -Well, he meant you.... Haven't you got anything more sensible to talk about? I've brought Jacob some bones. Well, if you don't want them... Just leave them in front of the door. There you are, Jacob, eat it! I've brought you a whole steak. You're just teasing him. If I'd known you were like this, I wouldn't have come. When we're allowed out again, we'll come and see you. I don't believe you. -We will. -lf I'm at home. Matic... -Oh, mommy. -What's the matter? -Nothing. Who brought this? -Rok. -Oh, Rok? -Yes, Rok. For Jacob. You can't imagine how fond he is of him. You devil! You know it's for you. He's brought you a whole steak, and bones too. -You know what? Go and wipe the door on the outside. Yes, mommy. That Rok really isn't your friend at all. There's writing in the elevator too and on the wall downstairs. What Milena is that? Not the one from the film? Are you very fond of her? -Leave me alone. Don't you like Nelly any more? Why don't you like Nelly any more? I'm not speaking to you. -That's not nice of you, to have two girlfriends at the same time. -I'll scalp Nelly. You mustn't scalp girls, Matic. -Leave me alone! Does Milena like you too? Are you fonder of her than you are of me? Damn women.... -Where were you? Come here. What were you doing over there? -Have you got it? -Yes. Did anyone see you? -No. -Show me! Look, first I press this button, then it records. Say something... You say something! -You talk... -OK. Black Bull is our chief. Now I press this button, I wait a bit and then press here... Say something. -You say something. -You talk. -Black Bull is our chief. -Maybe it'll work. -It all depends on you, Nelly. Mac! Mac! -I'm no Mac. I'm going to interview you. -You? -For the children's' paper. You think I don't know what your school marks are like? As if that mattered. What's the doggie's name? I'll give you, doggy. -How and where did you get Jacob? I got him from Mars, by telephone. -Can you tell our readers, who else acted in the film? -lf you could have read it all in the magazines. And what else interests your esteemed readers? There are rumours that you're in love with the actress Milena. You stupid! -Then why does she come to see you? Ninny! Who scribbled on the doors and in the elevator? -It wasn't me. -Well who then? Think I don't recognize your hearts? My notebook is full of them. If you were a boy, I'd give you a good pasting. It wasn't me. -Well who then? -It wasn't me, Matic. Will you get away, you black brute. I'll kill you! Jacob, Jacob, heel! Here, Jacob! Jacob! You damned cur, now I know why everything's rusting. I'll kill that black brute. Is he yours? Aren't you in my class? And the dog's called Jacob, like me. That was his name, when I got him. OK, OK, we'll be seeing each other in the fall. Yes, I know you want to do a wee, come on, let's go! The time is 7.20. A good housewife starts thinking about supper in the morning. We suggest could meat and the excellent mayonnaise.... Jacob! Jacob! Jacob... Are you pressing the right button? -Of course. The white one, she said. Then why does she come to see you? -Who scribbled on the doors? Jacob, Jacob! -It wasn't me. Do you hear...?! -Well who then? Think I don't recognise your hearts? I've got a whole notebook full of them! -Jacob! -lf you were a boy, I'd give you a good pasting. -It wasn't me. -Well who then? Hear that? She's after Matic, she doesn't even notice you. But... -Will you get away, you black brute! I'll kill you! She's having you on! Where's the dog? -Jacob, Jacob! Jacob! Jacob! Jacob! Jacob, heel! Here, Jacob! Jacob! Here Jacob! You damned cur. Now I know why everything's rusting. I'll kill that black brute. Is he yours? aren't you in my class? Run it through again! He'll get away! -I'll kill you! Jacob! Jacob, heel! Here, Jacob! -Quickly, close that door. Here, Jacob! Yes. I took him for a wee, like I always do, and now he's not anywhere. -Well, then he went outside. But how? The door was locked. What if he went down into the cellar? -I went down to look, everything's locked. -Wait! I'm coming with you, I'll just get dressed. Is it all right? -Quiet! Now you can bark! You don't think your father will come down here? -Not till the fall. Jacob! -When they start heating again, not before that though. There, Matic, now we're quits. See that, eh? Did you find him? -He's not there! Maybe he went to Milena's? Idiot! Matic, came and eat! I can't! You just eat, Matic, I've got something for Jacob too. You know how hungry he'll be when he comes. -He won't be back, ever. We've searched everywhere... -Listen, Matic! Every dog gets lost now and again. Eat up! If he's not here by tomorrow, we'll put an ad in the paper. You just read how many dogs are found. People like dogs, you know... -He's dead, I know he is! Remember what the teacher said? He'll kill him; I know he's done it. Don't talk like that, you know he didn't really mean it. I'II... I'II... I'll give him... What he was like? -Big, beautiful, smart. Big, and black with long hair -Trained! -Trained. Yes, a Newfoundland, yes! Jacob. Jacob's his name... Funny name, isn't it? We didn't give it to him. Tell them about the teacher! -Beg your pardon? What he's worth? You know, I don't really know. -A million, at least! No, no, I didn't say anything, I'm sorry! It was my son. Well, he'd be worth about 2 or 3 thousand, he was given to us. Yes, yes, I will. Thank you, officer. Now tell me exactly everything he said! Who put the ad in? -We did. As soon as we found him. Did you put the ad in? -He did. Well, come here! Sit down! Found big black dog that answers to the name of Jacob. And so on right down to the reward. Fine. How do you know his name's Jacob? We know. -Oh, you know. Well, if you know the dog's name, you know whose it is! You'll tell us yet! Has the owner come yet? Ask her in! Mrs. ?kerjanc? -Yes. -Just follow me, please. Is Jacob here? -Jacob? What Jacob? Oh nothing, nothing. He meant the dog. Come in! Hello! Do sit down! There, you see, these are the heroes who steal dogs. He bit me, you just look. -You baited him. It was your own fault! Everyone knows that. Don't they, Andrej? My son's so attached to him , you understand, don't you? I knew it would be all right, but he made such a fuss... And we've got used to him. You know, children pranks... These are no pranks. After all this is robbery and attempted extortion. You know the punishment for that under paragraph 249 of the Criminal law? Three months to one year's jail, for juveniles... No! What do you mean no? They didn't steal him. What?! -He got lost. All dogs get lost now and then, don't they, mommy? -They do, they do. Well, if he gets lost, that's another matter. You two know where to look for him! Don't you? Not so fast! I'm not finished yet! If we meet again, things'll be different! Good-bye! Good-bye! Mom. -All right. Go and get Jacob, but then come straight home. Good-bye! Children! -You know, a bit of a fright doesn't hurt them! -Thanks. Now get up! You'll be so handsome that all the lady dogs will be after you. Now be good, it'll soon be over. I know it hurts your eyes. Poor thing. If it's Rok, tell him to wait for me downstairs! I'll be down in a jiffy! Oh, it's you two? -We've come... -We've come to apologize. We didn't mean any harm... -I know, I know. Forgive us, and thank you. -Thank you very much. Oh, thank you for the lovely flowers. It was Matic's fault too. Now be friends, why should you quarrel. Look what I got. Are you coming down? -Yes. -Tell Rok to come too. We'll all be there. -Oh no, Jacob! Oh dear, look what you've done. -I'll clean it up, mom. I big chief Black Flash bury hatchet, How! Whiteface with dog my friend, his friends my friends. -Hurray, hurray! Why are you sulking? We're friends, aren't we? -Yes. His enemies are my enemies! Why are you acting like this? Are you mad at me? -At you? Why? Whiteface with dog be my brother, we two smoke pipe of peace. Hurray, hurray! Black Flash give white brother talisman. As long as Whiteface have my talisman, he my brother! How! Matic! Matic! -What's the matter? What's the matter? Matic, just look at you! Why, you're ill. What's made you sick? Breathe at me. You haven't been smoking, have you? You've been smoking, haven't you? Now he's started smoking... Water! -No water. Milk, you'd better have some milk. Will you remember now that cigarettes are not for children? I smoked the pipe of peace. -A pipe? Good heavens, Matic, what a savage you've become! I let you do as you like, go fighting, playing Indians and God knows what else. I even let you have Jacob, and you go and... What's this? A sling? -Mommy... How often have I told you that slings are not for children. Do you know how many children have lost eyes! -That's a talisman, I've got to have it. -lf there's one thing I hate, it's slings! Quiet! Now you're starting too! -Mommy, no. You damn dog, and I have to clean up after you. Jacob, Jacob! I'm so sorry, he was only looking for the sling. -It's either that dog or I! It's up to the tenants' council to decide. -But I'll clean up. I can't stand it any longer! They should be ashamed of themselves. Damn brats! In view of constant complaints by tenants because of infringements of Article 9 of the House Rules concerning the keeping of pets I hereby call an extra-ordinary meeting of the Tenants' Council. Agenda: 1. Complaint by Mrs. Anna Kmetic, the janitress and others because of Mrs. ?kerjanc's dog. Damn sling. -It's not only the sling. But the car, and the window... -Shut up! -Give him a chance! Let him finish reading it. 2. Miscellaneous: Chairman of the tenant's Council, sgd Jacob Badluck. What does that mean, sgd? -No idea. Don't you know? It means "sure to get you down". -No, it doesn't. We'll have to think of something. -But what? -What... All members of the Tenant's Council are old, and they'll be against Jacob. But what can they do to him? -Nothing! He'll have to go. I won't let him! There! Let them have their meeting! Do you think they won't have the meeting now? -Let them! I don't care. Why aren't we the Tenants' Council? That's right. Why aren't we the Tenants' Council, why doesn't anyone ask us? Nives is right. Why aren't we the Tenants' Council? But I won't let Jacob go! -I know. When's the meeting? This evening at eight they have... -At eight! I just know he'll have to go. Someone's coming... Let's go to the garage, there's never any peace around here. Matic, be good, right? I'll be back soon. You can watch television. The Pink Panther's on, do you hear? -Yes, mom. Mrs. ?kerjanc? Well, you see, that is the way it is. I can't do anything. There are quite specific complaints. We've been waiting for you. -Thanks. Look out now. Now! -Jacob, Jacob, Jacob! Quiet! Quiet! What's all this? Go home at once! Whatever are you thinking of! Why aren't we the Tenant's Council? -What? Who said that? We won't let Jacob go! -What do you mean? Who won't let... We won't let Jacob go! Jacob! Jacob! Jacob! Quiet! What's going on? Quiet I said! Come here! Well, come here to me. Aren't you from my school? -No. -Well what do you want? We won't let the dog go. -But who said anything? Who's talking about the dog? But there's go to be order, you understand that? What's your name? What were you thinking of? Putting the children up to that. You've got a nerve, you know everyone's against us. I didn't put anyone up to anything. -The disgrace of it. The things they said. How the Grudens can't sleep because that black monster up there howls all night... He doesn't howl, only did it twice. -The teacher's car is rusting! He doesn't wee there any more. -Whether he wees or not, you know what a serious person the teacher is. What about the trash cans? -That was your fault, you threw the sling into the garbage. Jacob got it for me. I told the janitress I'd clear up the mess, but she wouldn't let me, only so she could go and howl, the hysterical old bag. The way you talk! -She's hysterical, she is! -Matic! You said so yourself, a while ago... I did. And the window and the ball, and the doors! Never in my life did I feel so embarrassed. The beast howls, bites, he's a mortal danger. They don't let their children out to play any more! -They're lying! Listen, lots of people don't like dogs. -I don't care, I don't like them. You're big enough to understand. Jacob will have to go. He won't! -He will, and that's the end of that. -lf Jacob goes, I go too. -Not that too, Matic? -I won't let him go, I won't... Don't be pig-headed. Such dogs don't belong in apartment houses, get it? How can you say a thing like that! You don't love him, that's why. Matic, we can't go on like this. The dog will have to go and there' an end to it! Just imagine, if everyone in the building had a dog like that, how'd that be? A menagerie, a menagerie, a real menagerie. I'm sorry for Matic. -Well you tell me, what we can do. You've really been neglecting yourself, my dear. We'll try this lotion. Is it imported? -Of course. What else! Oh, that stupid... Oh, Milena, where're you off to? I've brought some bones for Jacob. You know how fond he is of me. Of me too. Where are Matic and Jacob? -Is he your steady? -No. He used to bi mine. But now he's not, I know, now he's got Jacob. Jacob will have to go. His mother's going to sell him. Well then I'll buy him. -You'll buy him? Think I haven't got anything in my piggy-bank? Have you any idea what a dog like that costs? Millions and millions, Matic told me himself. -What's up now? She's going to by Jacob, because Matic. Buy? Boy, we didn't think of that. We could all join together and by Jacob. -Yes, of course. All of us together. But not you! -Flash! Come here! I've got an idea! Jane?? What floor? Fourth? Up to the fourth floor. Go on! Jane?. Get going! Mommy, mother dear... Yes. -lf you give me another ten dinars, I'll clean the bathroom, too. Mommy'll be home before. -lf he promised, to come, he'll come. He'll come, yes, I know Niko. Tomorrow or the next day. Matic, mother gave me money for an ice-cream. There, for Jacob! Hand it over to me! But why are you going to by Jacob, if he's yours? Jacob must go. -My mother's going to sell him. But why's she going to sell him to you? Hey, master, master! We could clear up your yard and take the things to the dump! -Oh yeah? Don't you believe us? -Who're you? We're from that house over there. -We're going to buy Jacob. -Whom? A dog. That's his name. -Oh you're going to buy a dog? Well then you just clear up! But you won't be able to sell everything. Then we'll take it to the dump. Matic! Matic! Did you put the ad in? -Good that you're at home. Didn't you put it in? You still think I don't like Jacob? Where are you, my black boy? -You put it in, didn't you? Do you think I'm happy about it? We can't keep him. They're all against him. It's either us or the dog. -Well then let us go. Where to? It'd be the same everywhere. Will it be in the paper tomorrow? What can I do now, Matic? -We'll give him to someone like me, won't we? Jacob likes children. Can we go down now? -Down? Now? -Jacob's got to do wee. You'll be back straight away, won't you? It's raining... Rok! Come down quick! I've got to get back straight away, or mommy'll suspect something. Don't be scared, Jacob, it'll be all right. Listen when I speak to you. I know you'd like to go the car. But there'll be no more of that, you're going to stay with me. Everything's all right. It's all organized. We get up at five in the morning, we've got to be there by a six. Flash says, that there's masses of work. And they'll pay us too. Flash'll fix that. What I'm worried about is who's going to buy him. Did your mother put an ad in? -She didn't exactly say. Maybe she didn't. -Did she, or didn't she? -I don't know. Did Niko come? -Yes, he came and went to practice. When's he coming? -I don't know. I talk about Jacob and he talks about basketball. Let's give him up. Forget him. Well then, who else? I'm meeting Flash after supper, we'll think of something. -Well, all right, all right. But don't forget, there's got to be a garden and a lot of children, that's what I told mommy. If she asks for too much, no bargaining. -We'll fix it. Be good, we're going now. And you look out Rok, Flash is better at other things. Young Newfoundland dog, slightly trained, to be given away due to housing problems. Preferably to a good family with children. Condition: a big garden. -She's going to give him away. She didn't tell me that. -Good Grief, look at that: Enquiries to ?kerjanc, Concrete Settlement 36, 7th floor from 10 to 12 a.m. -Is your mother at home? Didn't she go to work? -Of course she did. She'll be home before ten. Now we're in a spot. Doesn't matter, Nelly, go and get Nata?a! The redhead? -Who else? But I don't know where she lives. -Of course you do, next door to me. Wait, I'm going with you! Hey you, little one, come here! Come on, both of you! You go down to the bus stop, right? -Yes. When you see Matic's mother, run and tell us. How! Nata?a's going to buy him. -My mother knows her. -She doesn't. Do you think... She knows everyone? -She's never been with us anywhere. Well yes, that's true. -You just trust me, she'll manage it. She's not a girl, she's real guy! -Did you tell her about the children? Matic, Nata?a's not at home. She's gone shopping with her mother! When's she coming back? -I didn't ask that. You goose! -None told me to. -Well run and ask when she'll be back! -You can go and run, I'm not going again. What? -I said, I'm not going again. -I'll go. -No! I told Nelly to go! Get going! -Nives, come with me. Now I'm not going, you should have waited for me before. No depending on Nata?a. -She'll come. -When it's too late. Stop moaning. Now listen to me: you stay near the elevator and look out that nothing goes wrong. This'll be the sign. She's coming, she's coming! Did you see? -No sign either Nelly or Nata?a. -Don't panic. What'll we do now? -She mustn't see anyone here, or there'll be trouble. -That's right. -Matic, she mustn't see you here! -Well you tell Nata?a what to do. Leave it to me. -Jacob, come here, Jacob! Did you hear? To your places, and the rest of you beat it, or do you want me to scalp you? I have spoken, How! -Run! Oh, you're at home? Just as well. Oh, mommy, isn't it hot today? Matic! -Yes... Who told you about the ad? -What? How did you hear about the ad? -Oh, the ad? Rok told me. Rok. And what did he say? -You mean, Rok? -Yes, Rok. What he said? Nothing... Nothing? -What is there to say? -And what about you? -Me? What's the matter with you? Can't you hear, what I'm asking you? I can hear. -You think it's the same to me? I'm very fond of him. It'd be better, if we'd never had him. If we have to give Jacob away, I'd rather someone like me got him. A garden's important, he's got have a garden. A big garden, that's the thing for Jacob. Who did he bite? -He didn't only do it once, there's more of them. Don't you believe be? Rok! -What is it? -Come here! How did Jacob bite you? -That's not a dog, that's a wild beast. It says he's trained. -Trained! He's vicious, not trained. He attacked me for no reason at all. And he bit me, and not only me. -He bit me too. Oh dear, and they offer you a dog like that, shameless people. I'll tell them a thing or two. I knew there'd be something wrong. Little boy, what floor is it? Who are you looking for? -The ?kerjances. -Seventh. Seventh? That's too much for my feet. Shame on them! People like that should be reported! Boy, that was close! Look out there's someone from the house coming! Shit! I know what I'll do. Wait! I'm on my way! What, what? Hey, wait! Couldn't you say were here? Is she coming? -Who? -Who, who! Nata?a! Did they tell you when she's coming? Didn't you go there? Don't you know when she's coming? -After lunch. But flash's not going to boss me around! What are you staring at? Go away and play. You go too! Give me the ball! You stubborn creature. Rok! Rok! -I know why she's here every day. Not because of Jacob, anyway. -Did you see the ad? Ages ago. We got up at five. do you think we can't read? She didn't mean it. -Matic's going steady with you now, isn't he? None of your business, snotty. -I'm not snotty, so there. Hell, can't you see there's someone coming. Follow me, quick. Hey, boy? -Yes? -Where's number 36? -36... Yes. That's 35 over there, this should be 36, but it's 16. How's that, eh? Everything's mixed around here. -What do you mean, mixed up? It should be down there somewhere. Do you know where 36 is? 36? -?kerjanc, I'm looking for the ?kerjanc family. -Oh, ?kerjanc? Isn't that Tony's? -What Tony? Where they have the black dog. -Yes, that's right. Where is it? Over there. That yellow block. -Which one? The one on the right or the one at the end? -That one, at the end. Well, you turn left there, then it's the first street to the right, there's a green block there... -Aha! Left and then right. Thanks, little boy! I'll little boy you! Jesus, I've got him bogged down, he won't be back today. Matic, I'll go. Oh, you've come about the ad? A big garden, lots of children... You'll have to talk to my mother. Mommy, she's come about the ad. Step right in, come on! I've come about the dog. Oh, isn't he lovely. And he's trained too? His name is Jacob. -And who are you? Why didn't your mommy or daddy come with you? Daddy's with Intertrade and he's on a business trip, and mommy's on duty. She said I'd better go alone. It might be too late. I've got money. -Have you got a garden? A big garden, and three brothers too. What did you say your name was? -Nata?a. -You've got a big garden, that's the main thing, isn't it? -A big garden. But I'd rather talk to your mommy or your daddy. Do you like dogs? -Yes. -Give her your paw. You just stroke him. Look how he lets her stroke him. -Jacob likes all children. Look, how about coming back tomorrow with your mommy? No, not tomorrow, he'd better go straight away today, if he must. Why do you so particularly want her to have Jacob? -Because! Because what? -Because! Where do you live? -You know where the Golden Duck Motel is? Back of there. -That really isn't far. I'll go with her, so I see where she lives. Can I come and see him sometime? -Every day, if you like. If I have time, I'll go and visit him, so he won't be bored. But, if we really give him to her, promise you won't cry? Is it all right now? Tra ra ra day, This is our day, Let's run this way, He likes everyone Our companion, Tra ra ra ran! Let everyone live, As he likes, We as we like, Tra ra ra rike, So will we Help ourselves: Happiness and we Tra ra ra ri Happiness on the lead!

Let everyone live, As he likes, We as we like, Tra ra ra rike, So will we Help ourselves: Happiness, and we Tra ra ra ri Happiness on the lead! Yes, boys, it's like this. We can still play outside here, but where's he going to sleep? That's right. We'll have to hide him at home. -But where? If we were to put him where we had him before? No, not there! -What about at the mechanic's? Think the mechanic will want to look at him all the time? Matic? -What is it? -How about putting him on the terrace. That's it! We'll put up a house there. There's never anyone there. That would really be best. -Has your father got a key? The janitress has it. -Your father will tell the janitor, and you'll grab it! Tomorrow we'll have our own anyway. Jump in, Jacob! In with you! Good boy, Jacob, Lift it, go one! Let's go! -Let's go! -Quiet! -Matic, wait for me! Is he going to wag that tail all the way? -Shut up, and carry it! Quiet, I said! What is it? Shoo, shoo, will you go! My mother says, if, if you meet a cat... Shut up, get going! You bunglers! Nata?a!? Nata?a? Do you hear? What? Eh? -Are they coming? Well then, quick, whistle! There's none round now. Come on! Come on! Gee, what'll we do now? Wait! There's someone coming! Let him come, we're here now! -Quiet, Jacob! It's all right now, none can hear him! Close the door! It was stupid of us, you know. He can't stay here. He'll jump over the wall. -Of course he can stay. Let's put him on a lead. How shall we get him down every day? -Same as up here. With the elevator? Are you crazy? So much laundry... Who would believe you? You're nuts. No, he can't stay here. -Well, not forever. We'll have to think of something else. -Flash will figure it out. Let's run before someone sees us. Come on, it's OK... Hurry up! If that door closed, we'd be stuck here. -You're my boy, Jacob, my boy... Good boy, Jacob... Who's on guard today? -Flash. Be patient, Jacob, good boy, Jacob... Matic, shall we have some stakes? -Yeah... Viennese style, with breadcrumbs? Well, how? Did you hear me, Matic? -With jam... It's bad, isn't it? For me too, you know. I know how you're feeling. -Well, at least he's in a safe place. My sweet child. Look at the steaks we're going to have, ha? The smell, I'm not going to eat that. They don't smell at all. What sort of a nose have you got? I'm not going to eat that, I'd rather have cereal. Nelly? No sweet? I'll eat it. -I'm coming. Well, that's the limit. I won't have you making things up! The steaks smells, why don't you eat your cereal then? I'd rather have the steak. -Now he wants steak again... I threw it away! See all the things they got for you. A real feast. Look, look, there's chocolate too... And this must be from Matic. Quiet, Jacob, quiet. Jacob... Jacob... Jacob, my Jacob... And thank you again, doctor. -The medicine as soon as possible. One tablet every day four hours. And lots of tea. Who'll run to the chemist's? -I will. -I will! And come back quick! -Yes! Is he going to die? -No, he's not. What's your name? Nives. But I'd like to see him. -You'll see him. Say hello from us! There, look at him! -Matic! Matic! Has the doctor come? You should know the doctor's car. He's coming! Yes, he's coming, that skunk! -He got us into this mess! Hello! -I'll show you... Who is it? Who is it? I'll give something to remember us by. Just wait till I get my hands on you, rascals! Is it tight? Damn rascals! I know why! Because of that black beast, because of that dog! Matic, you've got a visitor. Look, who's come. -Oh, it's you? It's me. -Look what she's brought you. Will you be up soon? The doctor gave me an injection, and I've got tablets to eat... Was your mother very angry? -She wasn't angry at all. She said that everyone has a right to their own secrets, only I should have told her about Jacob. I've got a secret too. Haven't you got one? -Maybe. Like mine? -I don't talk about that. As long as Jacob gets well. -Is he sick? Since when? He's in hospital. -What? That's why the trainer took him away. The trainer? When? -That same day... You lied to me! Jacob's not sick! You gave him to the trainer. Wait, Matic. You can go and see him. Where should he go? Isn't there enough wrong already? -You gave him away! It's not far at all. Soon you can go and see him. I'll buy you that red bicycle... -I don't want it, a bike is a bike, but a dog is alive! -Matic! -It's all the grown-ups' fault!
