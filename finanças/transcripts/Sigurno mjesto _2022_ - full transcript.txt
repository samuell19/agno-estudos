If none of this had happened, I could have told you: Look, this is your building, count to twenty, and I'll come running into the scene. Damir! Do you hear me? Shout if you can't get to the door! Damir! I'll break down the door. Move away! I'll break down the door, you hear me? Are you OK? Huh? Are you OK? Can you hold this? An ambulance is on its way. Don't. -Well, fuck it... Do you know your blood type? Hello. Hello, I phoned earlier. I called an ambulance to 3 Creska Street. I've just arrived... He is conscious, but I think he's lost a lot of blood. ...on his arm and neck. 3 Creska, third floor, that's right. They've arrived, thank you. Hello. What's happened? What's happened? A suicide attempt. Did you break in? -Yes. Hello. Just lift his legs up a bit. Bandage, please. How are you, are you in pain? What's your name? Damir. -Damir? Did you feel dizzy, or faint? I'm fine. -And when did this happen? At around three. Around three, are you sure? It's almost eight now. You're his friend? -Brother. You found him in this position? -No, he was standing, he fell when I broke in. I don't now his blood type. -Never mind. He'll be fine. Are you coming with us? -Yes, yes. Damir. Damir, keep your eyes open so we know you're with us, OK? Sorry, you can't go with us. -But, the doctor said... You got it wrong. But we're not going far, to Rendićeva. -Where? Rendićeva Street. -Listen... See you there. Hello, I think my brother is admitted here. Damir Lucić. Yes, second door to the right, ask them. OK, thank you. Hello. Excuse me, that's my brother. -Hi. Does he have hepatitis C? No, why? Is everything all right? It will be. The nurse will give you a paper to sign. Where? -Lena! Lena! Come here, young man. Check if everything is there, then sign. Here's the bag, for his things. Done? Just wait outside. I'll be outside. -It won't take long. So, what's the procedure now, I guess a psychiatrist? The doctor will explain everything. Bruno Lucić? -Yes. I need you to come with me to the flat, for the investigation. OK, let me just check with the doctor if he needs me here. How long will it take, do you know? Let's go. Wait a moment, let me just see if they need me here? C'mon. What's wrong with you? C'mon, don't waste my time. I must go with the officer back to the flat, do you need me here? It will take us at least half an hour, but do come back afterwards. And you are? Do you have a warrant? Sorry, I didn't want to cause trouble, you probably have a lot on your mind. -Unit 100, unit 100. Come in, 100. 124 leaving for the address. Copy. Hello. Hello. -Did you break in downstairs and the flat? Yes. -ID card, please. He couldn't open the door? Yes, he couldn't open it. I phoned him earlier and noticed something was wrong so I broke in. -Can you be more precise? He mentioned blood. I can't remember right now. -OK, it will come to you. Who wiped the blood off? Where? Here, here... And here. I have no idea. I really don't know. How long has he been in Zagreb for? He came here to work, early this year. -He hasn't registered his residence yet? Could be. -Nice. And what about this Beretta in the cabinet? He borrowed it for me from a friend, and I guess he never gave it back... -Do you have a firearm licence? I don't, but it's not working. I needed it for filming, I work in television. It's a prop. Run the gun check. Sorry, but I should go back to the hospital... Give him his ID. You are free to go. I will leave his stuff here. -Yes. Thank you, goodbye. -Goodbye. Let's go. I couldn't sleep. You took some pills? No. -Have you been drinking? No. -Sleep-deprived, and that's it? Excuse me, has a psychiatrist allowed this interrogation? You can't... -Do you want me to kick you out? You're too young for this. -No need for such comments. -Come on, get out! You've all flocked around the patient. Let him get some air. Madam, stop bossing around. Leave. I won't leave. It's fine. Are you gonna push me out? It's OK. Please, I want to note down your badge number. -Why, what have I done? What did you just do? Do you have to make comments like that? We have to draw up a report. -I just don't get it. -Who wiped the blood off? What are you saying? -Who wiped the blood off? Which intersection? Where to now? -To see a psychiatrist. Does it hurt? -No. The doctor will speak to him first, then to you. Hello. Excuse me, my brother's had an accident. I think my blood pressure is high... Could you give me something to calm me down? -Come in. Thank you. Hey, Mum. No, I didn't forget, that's tomorrow. I know, don't worry. Say hello to them, too. Listen... Can you go outside for a minute? OK. No, don't worry. OK, call me back later. OK, OK, it's all right... Bye. Excuse me, that's my brother. What's the procedure now? -MRI, then we're back here. Lucić! You are his brother, right? -Yes, I am. He was lucky, he only just missed the carotid artery. Tell me, has you brother been sick, suffered from depression? No, nothing like that. Has he been treated, or in therapy? No, never before. Last week, I persuaded him to see a psychologist. He went, but didn't like him, so we saw another one, she runs a private practice. What's her name? Vrljičak, Sanda. You noticed something was wrong so...? Yes, he was in low spirits. He is not usually like that. And he became somewhat oddly suspicious, that scared me. Was he afraid? He kept saying that people didn't have a good opinion of him but he couldn't tell me why he had this feeling nor why they would have a bad opinion of him. -Aha. I know his friends and the people he works with, and I believe I would find out. Have you talked to them? No, not directly. I didn't want to run the risk of him becoming suspicious of me too, if he finds out I've been asking around behind his back. Any trauma, prior to this, any event? His father passed away two years ago and... He broke up with his girlfriend... -You mean your father? Yes. But recently, no. He was happy when he came to Zagreb, when he got a job here, so... I don't know what he told you... That he hadn't slept for a few days and didn't know why he'd done it. Has he been taking any medications? -Doctor, MRI is full. Shall we do it tomorrow morning then? -Yes. No problem. Thank you. Sorry. This psychologist could not prescribe drugs for him. So, she advised me to take him to his GP to get a referral to a psychiatrist. But he got an appointment in more than a month. OK. Listen, he'll certainly have to stay here for observation, and then we'll see. This is a very serious suicide attempt. It's not, as they say, "a cry for help". Tomorrow morning we'll do both MRI and blood tests. Let me just finish this. So he is staying here, in the psychiatric ward? -Yes. Until we determine whether he poses a danger to himself, that is, until this danger is eliminated. Just a second. I've given him sleeping pills so don't be worried if he is drowsy. OK. Let me just say bye to him. -Of course. -Thank you. You'll have to stay here for a couple of days, you know. Did the doctor explain it to you? OK. I'm sorry. It's all right, don't be. I gave in. Now, now... It's going to be fine. Does Mum know? I'll have to tell her. I don't think we can hide it from her. OK. Do you want me to stay here with you? No. Are you sure? It's not a problem. -Yes. Go. I'll come in the morning. OK. What is this? We've put it on you for the funeral. We thought you'd choose a shirt like that. It was a gift from Kike's mom. Is that a problem? No. There's a cigarette for you. One of your friends asked me to put it in the coffin. Nice. You can only say the lines I write for you to say. I believe we know each other well enough for you to guess what I'd say now. True. Why are you doing this? We sued the hospital. I don't get them, I think they don't give a damn. And I haven't changed doctors' names. They are the same in this film as in real life. And also, you know what they say: When your house is on fire - get warm. How's Mum? Good. She is taking it better than I expected. She must be crying in her sleep? Worse than that - howling. I'm glad I went... I'm glad I went to see you in the mortuary. She didn't want to. A pathologist advised us against it. But... It wasn't that bad after all. The worst was... I don't know if you remember, when, in summer, we'd find dead cats and birds in the fields. You were just like that... bloated. I remember the cats. I didn't pass out. That's what I was afraid of - that I'd just collapse when I see you. But, it was hard for me to leave. As if... As if somebody's beating you up on the playground, and I just look away and leave. I know. I felt like getting up then or at least giving you a sign. You're mocking me, now. -I almost did that. You were so still, that, to me, it felt like everything around you was shaking. Don't be angry. I'm not angry. I'll go now. Already? -I have to. Well... I'm thinking of you. The last sense that went out was my hearing. With some deafening noise, like a plane taking off. Hey, Mum. -Hi. What's happening to us? -Well... Is that it? -Yeah, I couldn't be bothered to pack more. You wanna go straight to the hospital or home first? -To the hospital. Did you get any sleep? -I did. I took a pill. And where is it? Close to your place, right? -Yeah, less than five minutes away. I don't know what to tell the guys from work. Who? -Damir's colleagues. Why he is not at work, and that. Marin's already called. -So, what did you tell him? I didn't answer the call. Don't say anything. Weekend's coming anyway. We'll see then. Should I call one of his friends? Maybe, Nazlić? To visit him, you know. I dunno. Don't bother me with that now. Let him get better first and then he can decide for himself. I've spoken to Nađa, she knows the chief psychiatrist at the hospital. We're lucky in that respect. He's a Slovenian. Thank God. I think he's in here. Where is he? -Here somewhere. Excuse me. -Hello. -Hi. We are Damir Lucić's family, he was admitted last night. -Yes. But, please, don't stay long. You can visit him in the afternoon. Yeah, but he's not in the room. -He's right here with us. We'll just see if there's anything he needs. Son. Hi. How's your arm? Is it working? Did you see it yesterday? Like Terminator's. -It crossed my mind too. When did you arrive? -Just now. What a mess I've made. -Well, it could have been worse. Good thing you're alive. That's right. Did you get any sleep? Your eyes are a little... -I did. They must have given you something. Well... I also took Valium. And you? -I took some expired pills. Are you allowed to be here? Yeah, we asked. Don't worry. She said we could only stay a few minutes and come back in the afternoon. I brought you some stuff. I just couldn't find your phone. Is it in the flat? -No need. Please, come any time after three. We have to clean up a bit now, before the rounds. -OK. Let's go. We'll see you then in the afternoon. Do you need anything? Cigarettes. -Which ones? Bruno knows. What is it? I wanna go home. To Split? -Yes. I don't know how it works. You are admitted here now. I can ask I guess, but... Is everything OK in here? Don't just nod, say it. It's fine. Know what? We'll come in the afternoon, we can talk then so we don't make a fuss right now. OK? -OK. I'll go now. OK. See you soon. We'd like to see dr. Kolak. -Fourth floor, ask his assistant. His arm will be fine, and the blood test is good. -Thank God. Fourth floor, the last door. -Thank you. What do you think? OK. I thought he'd be worse. I didn't want to ask him any questions. -Yeah, all in good time. Hello. -Hi. Hello. You're waiting to see the doctor? -Yes. The boy with blonde hair, is he yours? -Yes, he is. My daughter is downstairs. Girls are on the other side. You haven't got the hang of it yet. Someone is in the office, or? -No. They said he was downstairs in the ward and the staff downstairs said he was here. Do you have to go to work? -No, no. There is a coffee machine next to the toilet. -Thank you. Any specific working hours? -No, he is always here. What, 24/7? I've been trying to get hold of him for a week. So, coffee's a good idea. Mum, would you like a cup? -No, thank you. "Get me out of here", she told me this morning. "Do you want me to kneel?" Hello. -Hello. Your are waiting for me? -Yes. We are the Lucićes. From Split? -Yes. Please, come in. Hello. I'm so sorry. -That's OK. You know... We observe, we observe for a long time. Indirectly also... What nurses report to us is maybe essential so... So there is nothing I can tell you now. Do you perhaps have any prognosis? I know it's hard to say. You know what it's like. It's not surgery, where you can fix a broken limb. We don't rush things around here. It takes a lot of patience. You realise that? -I do. Yes. One step at a time. I'd like to know, I've tried talking to him in every possible way in the last month. I really don't know how to. Do you have any advice? You just be a brother to him. You don't have to be his therapist. That wasn't my intention. But I'm not coping well with this. Especially when he starts being paranoid. Just be honest when you talk to him. His reactions to you are valuable to us. Could you tell me what you're planning to do? I suppose you'll prescribe some medications to him. -Yes. Medications, therapy, and then we'll see. Excuse me, I've put down some things I wanted to ask. Sure, go ahead. Can you tell me which medicines you'll give him? I'd rather not, you'll be searching them on the internet and you'll just get confused. Excuse me, but I'd really like to know. You are a strange woman. What do you mean by that? -Well, strange. I really don't know what to say to that. I don't know how you came to this conclusion based on such a short conversation. It feels like you don't trust us. As if... What about the car? -Shit. I'll leave it there. You wanna go by car? -Not really. Actually let's just sit down. I need a smoke. -OK. Do you have a cigarette? -No, I'll buy a pack. Get one for Damir, too. -OK. What do you think? What can I think. If he talked to us like that, how is he going to talk to Damir then. At least we know how to stand up for ourselves. He said he wanted to go to Split. -Yes, I heard. But no chance of that. They won't let him leave. He cut himself pretty good. That's his right arm. And the neck. Thank goodness you phoned him. -Well, he picked up. He could've not, that's a good sign. Nađa knows Kolak? -They went to university together. And they were both in politics during the war, I guess. She told me they knew each other quite well. I googled him a bit. He writes poetry. He self-published the only book he wrote. What's it like? It's terrible. He sails, and writes about palm trees, waves, and stuff like that. That's exactly what he looks like. This cigarette makes me dizzy. What are we having for lunch? -I don't know. Whatever. I wonder what he is having? We'll bring him some food. -Do whatever you like. I'll google those medicines a bit and take a nap. -OK. Great. I fell sick last night. I threw up, had a fever. I know. Just email it to me and I'll check. OK. Sure, I'll do it on time, don't worry. Thank you. Bye. Are you very busy? Not really, nothing important. Just don't get sick, too. You want tea or something? -No. Hey. What happened? Come in. Where are you going? Come in. Come in. Mum, we have a guest. My son... You came home? Sit down. Come on... What happened? Just calm down. They were making rounds. Probably doctor Kolak? They asked me if I could read other people's minds. What did you say? That I couldn't. But, I wasn't very convincing. Don't worry. I'm sure you'll talk to them again. That I'm sick partly because I think everything revolves around me. Wait, that's what the doctor told you? Later, in the hallway, I wanted to say something to one of them. And he told me... not to hope for any one-to-one sessions. Do you think he said it to get you off his back? I don't understand. Maybe he meant no harm, maybe he was in a hurry. I don't want to go back. Nađa knows a doctor who works there, so it should be OK. It's supposed to be better there than anywhere else. Is it so bad? They think I'm a schizophrenic. They think fuck all. I think they're trying to figure out your condition, and how to help you. Who called? -Grandma. Why don't you lie down a little, and then we'll see what to do next? Want to lie down here or in the living room? There. Go on, lie down. There's clothes here if you want to change. Give a shout if you need anything. I just got a call from the hospital. What did you tell them? -Nothing. That he wasn't here. Good. I have no idea what to do. What do you want to do? -I need a moment to think. I doubt he'll go back there willingly. Yeah, me too. I don't know how they've managed to come to all their conclusions so soon? Now I'm sorry I've mentioned his paranoia. I think that... That's probably the cops. You stay here. Good afternoon. -Good afternoon. I suppose you are looking for my brother. -Yes. Damir Lucić. Yes, he's not here. The hospital staff told us he'd left. They called? -Yes. Where could he be? Any idea? He is not in his flat. -No. I was about to call his friends, but I believe they would've contacted me so... Good afternoon. -We'll contact you if he gets in touch. And what about you, madam? Mother, right? -Yes, I just arrived from Split, so... Do you have his picture maybe? A recent one? -Just a moment. Here... It was taken last summer. -Thank you. Goodbye. Excuse me, so what's the plan now? Police patrols will be informed, bus and train stations searched. Thank you. Goodbye. You could've pretended to be more worried. You know you can smoke in here. He is on the balcony, I'm going there. -Wait, let's make a plan. I'll speak with Nađa. -About going to Split? It would be easier for me if he was there, and she is there too. I don't think Kolak will be of any help. Maybe it's better if he stays here, so we can be together. -Don't worry about that. OK. Hide them in the oven. It's stupid to even ask how you are. -I'm fine. Would you rather be in Split? I guess so. I think it's lunchtime now. They'll realise I'm gone. Don't worry, we'll figure something out. What's on your mind? What are you thinking about? I have no idea. Tell me one thing... Why did you wipe the blood off the walls? Did you wipe the blood off? It looked strange. I was afraid they might blame you when they find me. Where's Mum? -Making lunch. Marin called. He said he couldn't reach you. I didn't feel like going back to the flat to get your phone. Would you like a spare one I have here? No need. You don't feel like talking, huh? Don't stay too long. He seems not that bad. Nađa says he must go straight to hospital. If we decide to go to Split, Nađa would prescribe the same medicine so that he can carry on with his therapy. And she'd like to see him, before he goes to hospital. Well, that sounds as if she wants to help us. -Of course she does. Don't you please start being negative. All right, we are going to Split. -Can you drive? Sure. I just have to get the car. -Go then. I would like to leave as soon as possible. Go on, roll me a cigarette. Take mine. Got them? -Yeah. Maybe I should've taken something for his arm too. No, they bandaged the arm this morning. Do you want to get in the front seat? I've made such chaos. -It's all right. Don't torture yourself. It's not like I'm a war veteran. So what? You probably just snapped. The veterans and the starving kids in Africa are not the only ones who have problems. What about the police? Forget about the police, we're not in Switzerland. You're going to the hospital in Split, and that's it. After all, you harmed no one. Take them, they gave you those this morning in the hospital. Did they tell you what medications you are taking? Ask when they don't tell you. Ask them to explain. They just smile. What are those? -Antidepressants and Valium. A friend of mine said that when she first took Valium she though that those who invented it should get a Nobel prize. For peace. I think I have a spare pair of trousers. Here is the phone, we just have to switch it to your number. Is it yours? Was it in my trousers? I don't know. It's nothing, fuck it. Come on, get dressed. Must be from the harvest, you know? The olives. Don't worry. Get in the front. I can't hear you. Say again. I can't see a bakery. Is that the place? There you are, thank God. Here we are. I just need to find a spot. Damir. Do you know where we are going? To see Nađa. She wants to talk to you, to see how you are. Is that all right with you? You ask him now, after arranging everything. Shut up, silly. I'm talking to him. Sure. You'll see. You never know what might help you. Bruno. Come on, stop doing that. I won't beat around the bush. Do you think you've made a mistake? Will you try it again? I won't. Would you like to talk about it? OK. Bruno, please. He says he thinks he made a mistake, and he won't try doing it again. When you went to get the car he told me he didn't know why he'd done it. That my face was in front of his eyes all the time... ...but he's done it anyway. What's going on in his head? You know what the first psychologist told him, the one he saw before Easter? -What? After the first sessions, to take father's picture, light a candle and meditate for a while. That sure has helped him. We didn't talk about what we should say when we take him to the hospital. Nothing. I'll say it was my decision and that I made it without asking Damir. Let them call the police if they want. Look at you, bossy. Was she OK? Hey... Hey... Can you tell me what's on your mind when you're silent? When? Well... Like now, when you are not answering. Ask again. What do you think about Nađa? She's nice. Better than the doctors in Zagreb? I think I'm some kind of evil. Why do you think that? Are we some kind of evil? I don't think we are any better or worse than the others. Don't you think so? Do I have to go there now? We're going home first, to have something to eat, pack your clothes. Is that OK? Yeah. Damir and I are going home, and you can go to the store and get us some food. OK. Hey, Mum. Go on, put him on. What's up? Not to do what? But, what not to do? What do you mean? Yes, I heard, but what shouldn't I do? Damir, but what? What? He doesn't want to take the medicine. On the phone, he was just repeating... -Yes, I heard. Just keep calm. Hey. I couldn't understand what you were saying on the phone. Hm? Why does it have to be? Be what? Be like this? But what do you mean? Bruno, don't do it. But, what? What shouldn't I do? Don't kill yourself. What's with you? Don't. -I won't. Why do you think that? I promise I won't. Can you promise me the same? Are you cold? I'll get the heater, OK? Just a sec. What's going on? He is not well. He must go to hospital. But, Nađa said he seemed better than she'd expected. -He is completely... He is worried I might kill myself. I think he's projecting. Did you ask him about the medicine? Fuck the medicine. He must go to hospital. I'll go see him now. Where is he? Damir! Damir! Damir! Damir! I can't find him. Call my old number. -He is not answering. Wait for ten minutes and then call the police. -You think so? -Yes. I'll go look for him. What's up? OK. Please call Vedran and tell him what's going on. His father is in Search and Rescue team, maybe they can locate his phone. Do you have his number? I have no idea, the building close to the hotel. Damir! Damir! Damir! Damir! Damir! Yes... Did my mum give you his number? I think he took it with him. OK. My Mum is calling. Sorry, I have to answer it. OK. Say thanks to your dad. I'll call you back. Hey, Mum. OK, bye. I was looking for a recent picture of him. I gave the same one to them in Zagreb. I don't get why we have to report him missing, when they already know it. I don't know, the officer told me to come in person to report it. Those in the Search and Rescue team know someone in the police and they'll try to locate his phone. Thank God. Goddammit. Hello, we are here to report a missing person. My mother called earlier. -Yes, just a moment, please. It's urgent, because... -Yes, I know. Your mother explained. I'll call a colleague. Two persons are here to see you, to report a missing person. All right. He will see you soon. When he's done with the other case. This way, right? You must wait for the colleague to call you. He is not answering. What else did Nađa say? -I just told her what the two of you were talking in the car. She said not to reason with him about his fantasies. It's not at the level of rational. I don't understand how he disappeared so quickly. He could be somewhere in the garden. No, I looked for him there. Why did you think he might be somewhere around the hotel? That's where I would jump from. I thought he'd be somewhere with no people around. Sorry to bother you, but does your colleague know what this is about? -Yes, he was here when I spoke to your mother. -Can you... I can try to call him once again. Go upstairs. Room 215. Second floor. -Thank you. Hello. We are here to report a missing person. -Just a minute. It's urgent... He is a suicidal person... -OK, let me just finish with this. Stop calling him all the time. The battery will go flat and they won't be able to find him. God forbid. I don't know if I heard right, but after driving from Nađa's, I think he said he believes he is some kind of devil. Stop calling him all the time. How can I help? -Can we come in? -Yes, come in. I don't know if you are familiar with the situation, he tried to commit suicide and now he's run away from home... -Yes, yes... Here it is. Fill this in, please. Please, tell me, have you started the search, locating his phone? Just a moment, first things first. His life is in grave danger, do you understand that? Why didn't you give us these forms while we were waiting there like fools for ten minutes? Madam, I have children too. I know how you feel. Vedran's calling, you just fill the forms in. They found him. He probably went out for a beer. It's OK, it's OK... We are at the police station now. OK, I'll call you back. He's fine. They found him on the beach. Everything's fine. He was bumming a cigarette off someone and then one of your guys spotted him. They're bringing him here... Is this the station number three? -Yes, it is. OK, well... Sorry for being a little rude. -Well, you were a little rude. Where do we go now? -Same way you entered, downstairs, on protocol. Are you OK? -Yeah. Please, say again? They are going to kill me. What?! Wait in the hallway with him. And you come with me. And you, big guy, don't be scared. You ran so we had to catch you. Please, come in. Shall we sit down? This is from Damir Lucić. -Hello. What do we do? Do you want to take him home or we drive him to a psychiatric ward? They'll tie him up there. -Look, I don't think we have a choice because... I think it's by law. -Yes, I see. He ran away from Zagreb this morning. He is quick, has the will, that's important. Well, this is what we'll do. My colleagues will take him to the hospital. See if he needs some clothes or anything else. Should I wait here? -Yes. Call Matić, I think he's still downstairs. We are having something to eat now, would you like to join us? -No, thank you. And what about you, Madam? -No, thank you. And you, my friend? Have something to eat. A slice of bread, some cheese? Could I have a glass of water, please? My blood pressure's dropped. Here you are. -Thank you very much. Do you want a sip? Have some, it's the police spring water. Call the ambulance! Can you call the ambulance? Are you OK? You can't go with us. Are you taking him to the emergency room? Yes, surgical unit. It's OK, Mum, the wound's not deep. Now they'll... -Don't say anything. Calm down. You don't want him to see you like this. I've been holding it back all day, didn't help much. He's upstairs. Good evening, we are with Damir Lucić... Yes, yes... He's inside, go ahead. -Thank you. My darling. It is nothing serious, but we want to X-ray the chest, just in case. Good evening. Dr Maras, psychiatrist. I won't shake hands with you, I don't want you to strain yourself. What's your name? I have to ask you that. To see if you're responsive. Damir. What's happened, Damir? Can we speak instead of you, Damir? Of course. Damir can join whenever he feels like it.

Well... I'll prescribe medications. Are you from Split? -Yeah. Doctor, may I? -Yes, sure. We'll get him ready for an X-ray. Please, wait outside. In the waiting room. It won't take long. -All right.

Shall we say bye to him? No, wait outside... We'll see him when they take him for an X-ray. He is resting now. Don't worry, it won't hurt. Good evening. -Hello. Good evening. I'm calling Nađa. -Good. What's going on? -It's Saturday night fever. She's not answering. I should also get changed. Please, come in. Come in, please. Yes... I'm sorry. The resuscitation was unsuccessful. He died. My condolences. His head injuries were... You've mistaken us, we are the Lucićes... I know. -We've just arrived... I was down there by accident, I tried to resuscitate him, but... The window was...
