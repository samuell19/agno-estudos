- Would you like something else? - That's fine, thanks. - I'll get you another amphora. - Thanks. Very good. Your father should help us. Androcles is right. Come help us, Dad. For what? Ah! This one? - Will you help or not? Father - I didn't finish my meal. thank you Let me go! I am the king of Thebes! Quick, come! Enough for now! Let's go. In his hair there was the smell of the sea. His eyes were honey. His hips were curved like a Tyrian amphora... and supported the marble legs. His skin was sweet. The sun drew his shadow. - And then? Later? - Timothy. - I just talked. - You tell me, Androcles. I can't spend my life tethered to a horse. You can't spend your life getting into trouble. Because his father is always the one to get him out of trouble. And even? He forced the king of Thebes to fight like anyone else. That's true. By Pandora's vase! And it still smells like wine! Of course! It's the only remedy for my ailment, wine. Good! And that dancer wasn't bad at all! Enough! My son will marry a king's daughter! The King of Callia. Callia is a kingdom like all others. Be quiet. I should be ashamed. As if I didn't know you mess with women. A beautiful example you are! I know. It's my weakness. This was the last time. When we return, I will lock you in the palace. - Damn you! - I said nothing! Look, the sun! Stop! Where are you going? Greece is bloodied! Our poor homeland! Run away! What it says? Who hurt you? Look, this blood doesn't come from a wound, but from heaven! Strange phenomena devastate Helade... in all your cities the people flee from the endless night! And from heaven, look! It rains blood from the sky! Death is upon us! It is the ruin of the cities of Helade! What happens? What does that mean? I do not know! It can only be signs from heaven. Only Tiresias the soothsayer can reveal this mystery. Let's go to Thebes. The gods spoke. With the lightning, with the heart, with the winds... they said. But not to threaten or punish. To still help men. They said. Tell me Tiresias, what threatens us? One being, one thing. A danger threatens Helade. A new danger... that comes from far away. Who wants to attack us? Who dares to face the Greeks? The forces of evil. The terrible forces of a new evil in the West. Beyond the seas and the straits from which no ships left. Beyond the seas... beyond the strait from which no ship left. Beyond the strait, Tiresias said. Beyond the strait. The great danger that threatens us comes from the great seas. I tell you that we must attack these forces... before they reach our city. Attack them and destroy them. But if we don't even know who they are and where they are! - Isn't that true, brother? - That's right. We cannot face something in uncharted seas. - Isn't that true, brother? - That's right. And in lands never traveled. - Isn't that true, brother? - That's right. If I could decide, I would not hesitate to join you. But it is the Council of Thirty that rules my kingdom. It is difficult for the 30 advisors to agree. But I'm in control of my kingdom. I will use reason. It is better to attack than defend. Persenope! Yes mom. Let's split up. Some attack, others defend. - And you'll be one of the defenders. - Truth. No doubt. Attack, and I'll cover you. Very good! And take advantage of our absence to take over our kingdoms. - Right, brother? - What did you insinuate? That your wounds have not yet healed from defeat. True? And who lives waiting for revenge. - I challenge you! - Challenge me? He challenges you. To you. Well, he is ready to take up the challenge. I challenge you to sustain the insult with weapons! He's ready anytime and with any weapon. - Truth? - Not. If he said no, it's no. Friends, we don't get together to vent our grudges... but to unite us against the enemy that threatens us. How can you expect the enemy to attack... that destroys our cities? Passively. - Passively. - Passively. But with weapons ready! Of course, ready to kill anyone who dares attack us. - Truth? - Right. My army is invincible! My ships can carry it. Persenope! But it would be crazy to leave town. Look at the map of Greece. See the borders of my kingdom. I swear by all the gods that no one will dare to cross them. From here... until here. If you think you impressed me with this spectacle, you are wrong! Luck gets tired of seeing a bragging king. The tribute it owes for the last war has not yet been paid. If you think you're going to fill your vault with my gold... for a wrong alliance... no! He arrives! I thought they would be united, ready to defend our land. You are very impulsive! Facing an unknown enemy is very dangerous. It is true. Are none of you willing to follow me? - You? - I am not. Whatever. I will leave alone with my warriors. I leave my house to defend others. Sorry, but who will rule your kingdom in your absence? The advice. I have decided. We forgot about it. Who will succeed him on the throne if...? In case of death? Say openly, do not be afraid, dear cousin. Of death. I haven't even left yet and they're already thinking about dividing my kingdom. - Let's split it. - I and he. - Pigs! - Fear not, Androcles! I will make it so that no one sits on his throne... during his absence! It will be rebuilt the day Androcles returns! What a pity! It was a beautiful throne! It was carved by Darius of Tyre. I'll have an even more beautiful one built to celebrate his return. My return? Ours, I wanted to say. Will you leave again? Will you abandon me as usual? But I didn't say anything. No, but I know him very well. I wouldn't let Androcles go alone. You'd rather glory than live with your wife. Beside your son, who you barely know, after so much traveling... to fight, to fight. Is that you? Even so, judging me so badly, do you still love me? Sometimes I barely say my love. But it would be easier to set the sea on fire... that smother it in you. No, Dejanira. I love her too. - And you know this. - That's why I suffer. This time, I will not leave. I had already decided before. But if I had any doubts, now I don't. I don't want you to suffer because of me. - Are you speaking sincerely? - Interest. The time has come for me to rest peacefully... like any man. - Hercules. - What you want? Forgive me, but I expected an answer from Hercules... for our departure. I give it to you. Hercules is in Thebes. But how? Don't you see? You must come. We cannot stay here, waiting. Think. I am thinking very well. That's why I stay in Thebes. Here I have my house, my wife, my son. It's time to finally enjoy and live in peace. You are our friend. You can't take him away from me again. Everything is fine. When he asked me to accompany him, I went... even in the riskiest campaigns. It's not that I wasn't afraid. But Dejanira is right. Maybe if I had a wife and a kid, I'd act like you. See you soon. I await you at the palace. To drink the old wine of Tyre... for the success of my mission. But... Do you think you will be very angry? It's hard to predict. But now it's done. If he only knew I put the sleeping pill in the wine. He is waking up. I'm walking. Imagine if he finds me on board. - Wait, I'll go with you! - Stay here! - Nice day. - Not bad. - How long have we been at sea? - Since dawn. Where is your fleet? Where are your warriors? That's why I needed you. I understand. And this would be the crew? Sailors and condemned to death. - Nice company. - The best I could find. A question: Were you not the king of Thebes, or am I mistaken? The generals and elders were against me. It's democracy. Very good. So I didn't go wrong in breaking the throne, it seems. Sorry, but how do you intend to defeat the enemy? Do we count on Timothy? No ironies. An unknown enemy is twice as strong. We must find out who it is... and from what unknown land threatens us. What is its potency. What are your weapons... what are their plans, how they intend to attack. - Hercules, what are you doing? - I'm going to sleep. Did not like. I wish he had been angry. Illus, wake up! I brought you food. I can not take it anymore. I've been here for six days. I'm sick. I'm going up. Do not move! What if Hercules finds out? He asked if you had stayed in Thebes. - What did you say? - What question! - What else did he say? - Nothing. He eats and sleeps. -And when he doesn't sleep, he fishes. - Fishing? Fishing. - And catch fish? - Not. Hercules sleeps. Androcles stays at the wheel. Rest assured. The land is close. Nobody will surprise us. Fast! The water shouldn't be far away. Soon the men will return... and we can leave with the sun still high. Look, behind the horizon is the mystery we're looking for. Let's find out what it is... and the Greeks will know the danger that threatens us. Do you think the gods will help you? I will join the men. I don't like them stuffed in caves. You never know what's in there. And it's not the best crew for such a mission. Sleep, don't worry. It will be agreed upon, prior to departure. Everyone went down, but you can't go down. I can't take it anymore, let me go up for a moment. It's not time for your father to know you're on board yet. - After the straits. - I can not take it anymore! I am going out! Shut up, the sailors are back! Help! Hercules! Hercules! Help! Help-me! Now, Hoist the sail! Hoist the sail! Faster! Let's go with the oars! Stronger! Even stronger! Force! Eoles, god of winds, stop the wind. Thanks. Stronger! Force! Wine would be better. Come. Come. Wait here for our return... or by some other passing ship. - Think it's a good idea? - Even though they are criminals... it cannot force them to meet death. I'm talking about us. Is different. We choose this freely. How will we maneuver the ship in three? In three? I mean two. One on the sail, one on the wheel. It's enough. Go to the wheel. He said that the movement of the sea helps him to sleep. Come here! - Can you hold the wheel? - Sure. Wake up. We are in the middle of a storm. - Need to lower the candles. - Excellent. Do it. - He said he could. - I was wrong. Bring that rope! Put it down! Help-me! Hercules, help him, or do I have to go? - I'm going on deck! - Are you crazy? I can't stay closed any longer, I prefer to face my father. I can help. How foolish! Just now that Hercules has decided to help us. The glare illuminated something. - Go see. - Stay on the wheel. Go fast! Go fast! There are rocks here. What you're seeing? Rocks. Turn right! A little more. We're on top! Androcles! Androcles! Hercules! Hercules! Hercules! Hercules! Hercules Hercules Zeus, omnipotent! Zeus, my father! Listen me. If Androcles is still alive, if that's what you wanted to tell me... let me review it. I want to help you. Save him. Zeus, my father! Kill me. Kill me, I beg you! Do not fear. I don't want to harm you. End this torment. Kill me! Who is it? That God pursues her? Escape, Alien, Escape! But who imprisoned her? He was a man like you, then turned into water... then in a snake, he is everywhere. In the air we breathe, in the land we step on. Go away! It is not known in what form it may appear! - Who is the monster that threatens her? - Proteus. Run away! Run away! It's him! He's good advice, foreigner, go away. I don't want intruders on my island. If you don't leave, you will die. - I'm safe. - Yes, Proteus is dead. That's his blood. As he said, this island, this rock... it was where he sacrificed his victims. - But now its over. - Can you believe it? It was my people who sacrificed me and handed me over to him... to protect my country. Killing him was against the will of the Gods. No, without the help of the Gods... I could never kill that monster. And they themselves will still help us. That's my land! Atlantis! Today is the day dedicated to Uranus. The queen is in the temple for the sacred ceremony. No, no, my son, no. No, no, my son, no. Children are offered to the cult of Uranus... and led to the sacred mountain. Antinea, forgive me if I interrupt the ceremony... but the mist that protects our island has dissipated. I saw it from the mountain. Nothing else hides Atlantis from the eyes of mortals. Uranus has abandoned us. This is his reason for anger. Do you hear the sounds coming from the mountain? We will make other sacrifices to Proteus. No, Proteus no longer needs any more human victims. What you mean? Who are you? I am Hercules from Thebes... my father, Zeus, guided me here. Leave him. No mortal has ever dared to set foot... in the lands of Atlantis. Why are you here? Why did you challenge the wrath of our God? I don't believe in bad Gods, I've always fought this idea... that they want human sacrifices to satiate... his thirst for blood and death. So I killed Proteus. So I saved the girl destined for the monster's wrath. Mind. Mom... forgive me. Why all this silence? Her daughter is alive, and there is no joy in her eyes. She committed the greatest of sacrilege. She killed the creature of Uranus: Proteus. And with her death, the fog that protected Atlantis was dissipated. What are you hiding so that other men cannot see? What are you looking for in Atlantis, Hercules of Thebes? Brought Ismenia back to her mother. And if the gods were against it, I wouldn't be here. They would not have helped me to destroy Proteus. Maybe you're right, maybe we were wrong... Mom. If we make a mistake, let's fix the mistake and we'll thank you. Come, my daughter. I'm glad she's back. All that remains is for me to ask your forgiveness. And thank the man who saved her. Don't thank me. Chance brought me here, looking for a friend. Chance gave my daughter more luck than her friend... if I brought you to this island. No foreigners have ever landed here. My friend Androcles disappeared at sea during a storm. I know he's alive, but he's in danger. If his friend were here, I would tell him. I would do anything to reward you... for saving my daughter's life. But now let's celebrate his victory over Proteus. And let us hope that this augurs well. You will be my guest. Order whatever you want to recover from your fatigue. - Mom... I seem to have woken up from a nightmare. I shudder when I think of the death that awaited me. I love her so much. Even more than before. Okay, I understand you too, my daughter. And yet, if Hercules hadn't saved her... her fate would have been less cruel. Less cruel? What you mean? When I set her up as a victim of Proteus, I suffered a great deal. To satisfy the cruelty of that damn monster... there was no need to sacrifice a queen's daughter. You are the daughter of Antinea. My daughter... and if she were to die, it would be for an imperative reason. But... I do not understand. Her fate is linked to mine, like mine... is connected to my kingdom. I never told you the truth, because death is the truth... has the same meaning. And yet, nothing has changed. The day a female spawned by me... survive me, Atlantis will be destroyed. But I... so... You must die. I do not wanna die! I do not wanna die! Take her away! No, I don't want to die! Androcles! Androcles, stop! Androcles, why...? - It's not possible. - What is not possible? This man. I saw Androcles. Androcles? I do not understand you. Me neither. I'm sure I saw my friend. But now? I don't doubt his word, but... Do you think I dreamed? It also seems to me to have dreamed. No, our desires lead us to mistakes. The hope of seeing a loved one makes us see them... where she is not. You're right. You must be tired from the long journey. He saw only death and pain on his way. It would be better if he distracted himself by seeing more pleasant things. Wake up, the knights are coming. Leave me alone. We've been looking for land for days. Now I want to sleep. Wake up! They are close, and I saw a woman with them. - She must be in danger. - A woman! Secure her here. Let's wait for twilight. Why wait for twilight? These are orders from Antinea. I wish somebody else has received that order At dusk, it will be thrown over the rocks. And she doesn't look at me like that. It's your mother who wants her dead. If it were for me... What do you want to do? Save that woman. Will I let you die? But I don't want to die, to save her. Get down! - There is more? - No, the last one died. Quick, girl! Courage, there is no more danger. We will protect you. It's useless. - Why? - They'll find me. I can't run away from my destiny. I must die. Explain. Who wants to kill her? - What kind of country is this? - An unwelcoming country. Run away. They'll kill them, too. Perhaps by now they have already killed Hercules. Hercules? Is Hercules here? - Do you know him? -He IS my father. Stay calm. If he's here, he'll fix everything. In Greece we like dancers more than magic. It's not magic. It's nature itself. We, in Atlantis, try to beat nature... for it to serve us. Nature pleases me as it is. Wild and yet sweet. Cruel and generous. Perhaps because your strength and courage allow you... not be afraid of the mysteries of the universe. Why? You are afraid? Maybe. Why do you want to leave? Stay with me. - Doesn't my company please you? - I need to find Androcles. I will have no peace until I know where he is. Maybe he died... and his body is in the depths of the sea. I would like to be with you, but now I can't. What a pity! If you like, I will give you a ship to continue your search. But one thing I ask of you. Promise you will come back. I will come back, I promise. Androcles! I hate him! I hate him! Why did you come to Atlantis? What do you want from us? What do you say, Androcles? Got mad? You're crazy if you think you'll fight Atlantis... with the meager strength of your muscles. You can kill me, but she will destroy you! It will destroy all beings like you. All who oppose our will and power. There will be no more hope for you. - Listen me. - No. You listen to me. Gonna die... how will all Greeks die in a bloodbath... that will cleanse the earth. A fiery sky will light our victory. And the useless temples of their Gods will crumble. A great God will come out of nowhere... Uranus will rule the heavens! Don't blaspheme! Sorry, I didn't want... Because lied? Why didn't you say Androcles was here? You are always suspicious. Who knows what ignoble feelings he attributes to my soul. Perhaps he was fooled by the visions... of your sick mind. I believe in what I see and feel. You can't deny that you lied to me! He said that Androcles was not in Atlantis. Perhaps you recognize that madman from the Senate as being your friend... the one he took the risk of to know what happened. - Why didn't you tell me? - I wanted to save you the pain. Androcles had disappeared for you. Since he's dead, I don't know if it's better to have pity on him... as I had, or else... No, if you felt sorry for him, please continue to do so. And forgive me for suspecting his feelings. Take him away and take care of him. Do not worry. If you stay here, together we can cure you. Whenever you want. Drink this wine, it will help you to rest. I hope that tomorrow you decide to stay here... as long as you want. Even for life. No one from Atlantis would dare attack us. And two men managed to get them to flee? If you give us more men, they won't escape. I will arrest them. I swear it will be the last time it will happen... something like that. You're right. It will be the last time. Not! Not! Let me go! Let me go! No, no! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! We have to get rid of him. It got out of your control. - He's become dangerous. - Dangerous for whom? To Atlantis. I am the queen of Atlantis and who decides life and death. Open up! Poor Androcles. Too fragile for the weight it should bear. Another will ascend the throne that was meant for you. Hercules! Take him to the valley and let him die like all the weak. Find Ismenia and kill her! Kill her! It can't have left here. The bars are intact. Wherever you are? It can't have disappeared. Look for him! Find him! The soldiers! It's Androcles, let's go! Is he crazy? With so many soldiers! I just want to follow them. See where they will take you! Others are coming! - Got hurt? - Not. It's Hercules! Hercules! Hercules! - Stop - Stop - Did you bring us another guest? - Yeah, that one over there. Put him down in the ditch! Feed those bastards! Eat, otherwise it'll be over soon! Hercules, I'm here! Timotheus Zeus, I thank you. I thought you died on the ship. We think that too. And then when Ilus saved that girl... Illus? And how did he get here? He was with us on the ship. Don't be angry. Illus, what do you want to do? No, there are many. If we released those people, we could face them better. Like? Downstairs is a palisade. We should take it down. It's absurd, what you're doing. Even if you make it through, the guards will come. We'd better hide. If my father finds me hiding with a woman... it breaks me down. He needs to find me doing something useful. And we hide later. Come quickly! They are tearing down the stockade! The soldiers are coming! Father Zeus, thank you. He is alive. To the stockade! Foreigners fled. They're releasing the prisoners! The soldiers! Let's go! Courage! See the wounds we have on our body, on our face? It was Antinea who, with leprosy, sentenced us to death! Until today, we cursed the fate that kept us alive... and the crazy hope that we had to escape it. - Why does she do this? - To create a new race. In the sacred mountain there is a stone that lives... and who has the power to transform man. - What does it mean? - I do not know. I just know we died. Antinea's guards look for the children... destined to the mysterious influence of that stone. Some resist. Others do not. The children we saw... We were like them when we were taken to the mountain... many years ago. Look at us now. Those who resist, I don't know which end they lead. Nobody saw the ones that survived. They say they transform into supernatural beings. Very strong, invincible. - I'll go to the mountain. - It's better to attack Atlantis! Hercules is right. We will not be free without destroying the powers of that stone. I accompany you. Wait for me here and take care of Androcles. When I get back, we'll decide what to do. Yes father. Let's go. Do not Cry. You will see, it will all be over soon. I'm taking her to Greece. It's different there. And this season, it's beautiful. Young people only think about love. Foreigner, my companions want to march to Atlantis. Are you crazy? Stop! Didn't you hear my father? We are grateful to him, but in this matter, he cannot give us orders. He cannot stop our revenge! If you're afraid, stay here and obey your father. I will try to stop them. Take care of Ismenia and Androcles. Illus! This is the origin of good and evil! At the bottom is the stone that generates force or death. Do not believe me? Do you think I'm crazy? After all I've endured? Crazy, isn't it? You cannot believe that a stone destroys men and things... transform bodies and minds! He does not believe that all the power of heaven is enclosed in a stone... and all the evil on Earth! It is a stone of light, but also of death! He was doomed. He ended your pain! The light touched him and the man disappeared. Light does not only give life. Who is it, priest? There are no years in your face, no time in your eyes. Many years ago, before Zeus, his father... reign on Earth and over men... another God, immense, powerful, dominated Olympus. Uranus. But betrayed by his children, Uranus was wounded and descended into nothingness. The blood from his wounds fell into the sea and was swallowed. Only one drop fell to the earth. On an island lost at sea... a drop of the precious blood of Uranus fell. And this blood turned to stone. A living stone that gives light and darkness. Life and death. Antinea, the queen, wants to use the strength of this stone. Years passed. Years of sacrifice and death. And now, Antinea has attracted the curse of Uranus... and she will use the stone to be invincible against men. He's a priest. How can you speak of destruction and death? I am the last priest of Uranus. I love the last drop of your blood, the memory of him. Uranus was a just God, not revenge. If what you say is true, this stone must be destroyed... it has done a lot of harm. No one can destroy the blood of Uranus. Nobody on Earth. Just something outside and above us... that by touching it, he will be able to dissolve the stone. Reveal to me the secret of that strength. Only to the one who is stronger than stone... I will be able to reveal the mystery of the end of Uranus. Take that iron, Hercules and prove your strength. Zeus, my father, listen to me. It's not pride that I do this and you know it. It's just to soften your stone hearts... and that they may have mercy. Drop your eyes, hard as crystal. Don't leave me on this test. Listen, Hercules of Thebes... only the sun can dissolve Uranus' blood. When a man destroys the rock... and a ray of sunlight touches the stone... it will be the end of the kingdom of Antinea and Atlantis... and its inhabitants. Thank you, and fear not. I will beat Antinea... without destroying Atlantis and its people. I will put an end to your domain, with the help of my companions. Antinea Antinea Where is my son? Where is Androk? His son is alive. Fear not, Hercules. He is saved. What has he done to you? Where is it? Why did he spare you? I did it for you, Hercules Listen to me. It could kill your son and all your friends. I could have killed you. That's what I should have done. That's what my people advised me. But I refused their advice. I wanted him alive because I love him. If you want, you will be by my side for the conquest of the world. All men on earth will recognize me as queen... and they will worship him as their only God. Love me and we will reign over all men and Gods. And what are your weapons to conquer the world? These are my soldiers, to whom... no force in the world will be able to oppose it. It is the chosen race, born from the blood of Uranus. Lift that table and throw it as far as you can. With this new race, I will rule the world. And you will be by my side. You're crazy, but I'm going to put an end to your madness. Father! Illus! Father! Why didn't you wait for me to return? You're right, but they wanted to attack the city. I did everything to stop them, but I couldn't. - Where are the others? - I do not know. Timothy is safe with Ismenia and Androcles. They must be safe. I was struck by a warrior. When I woke up, I was here. They were too strong for us. Father, look! I understand. That's what this place is. With the mist rising, Androcles called for my help. It was here that he lost knowledge and memory. It's the same thing Antinea wants to do to us. Look! That gallery connects to the temple. From there you reach the sea. Find a boat and run away. - Is that you? - I'll catch up if I can. Obey this time and if I don't come back... take care of your mother. They discovered our escape. Let's go! To the horses! Follow me! Quick, follow me! - Help! - It is me! Illus! It's still me! - Where is Ismenia? -She was arrested, like Androcles. I tried to stop it. I threw myself at the soldiers. I fought like a lion. I killed I don't even know how many. Timothy, you ran away. Where are they now? On that ship, to be sacrificed to the gods of the sea. They will set the ship on fire and abandon it to the winds. We must get on board the ship. - What? - Scream. Shout out? - Call for help! - But are you crazy? Scream. Leave me alone! Help! He's gone crazy! - Scream. - He is well. Help! Leave me alone! I bring a prisoner. You can hoist the anchor! - They haven't given the signal yet. - I'm in charge. Let's go! Don't scream, Ismenia. I am Illus. - Illus! - Quiet. - You scream! - Help! The sun is not standing still, Hercules. And where there is now shadow, soon there will be light. Get out of this place. Fate doesn't want you to die. The ship will burn... and the waves of the sea, appeased, will not seek other victims. Thus, they will protect our warriors' journey. The sign. Get down and I'll set fire. What are you doing? Come down! But what does it do? Illus! Release Timothy. Come on! Look, Hercules! Hercules! What was there? What ship is this? Where are we? Don't remember anything? The storm. I fell into the sea. I called him. Then I clung to a rock and I don't remember anything else. - You don't know what you've done? - What did I do? He managed to save Greece. In the great strait I will build two columns. they will remind men not to venture into the unknown and not challenge the Gods.
