Translated, subbed, and timed by Rjgman56. Enjoy! Excuse me! Please take this flier. Thank you! What's wrong? You're just staring off into the distance. You still can't forget about that guy? That guy? The one in the painting. Oh, Van Gogh. That guy! That guy! That's not it. Why are you bringing him up after all this time? Then is it that guy who pretends that he's a human? It was Yoshio-san wasn't it? That's right! He's a little strange. What a weirdo! Speaking of which! Stop getting into her personal space! Get outta here you pervs! It's snowing! Awesome! We're in for it now! It's gonna get cold! Humans are... Humans are... That's right. That's exactly right. But... Remember these words! Cats are.. Cats are... My name is Yoshio. I live in a warehouse behind the supermarket. There was a customer yesterday.. When it was her turn to check out.. She told me "Ah! Hold on!" Then she back to the supermarket. Well..Those types of customers..(This girl is Saori.) Saori comes to the place where I'm at and she tells me what happened in the store. As well as stories about her experiences as a cashier. The only thing she talks about is her own desires and what's on her mind though... She tells me everything. Hurry! Hurry! The customer is waiting! It's so annoying! That manager is overcautious in small matters! He doesn't need to freak out so much! (Even if I'm in the warehouse...) I know all about the merchandise on display. Even the merchandise that nobody has seen. I'm very familiar with them. I think you should talk back to him! I mean, wasn't it the customer's fault to begin with? You don't always say what you think Saori. That manager! He always orders the wrong stuff and loses goods! Before you criticize other people's work... You need to make sure you are doing your job right! I hope that he can learn how to be calm and collected like adults should be. It's the morning meeting! I have to go now! Sorry! Just wait for me. I'll always find you in your usual place after all. Good morning Saori! Good morning. I've been hearing cats meow since yesterday. There will be some people who secretly keep cats in their apartment. If I find them, I will definitely deal with them! Well, that's true. That bat is a little bit scary... I'll hurry up and find a house. Saori won't lie to me. Me and Saori..are perfect! Our rivals have opened up a large super market. They sure have snatched a lot of our customers before. But this month's sales have picked up. Now then! Takahashi of the head office will announce the statistics of the amount of customers the cashiers got. Good work everyone. My name is Takahashi. Good work! I will announce the statistics of the amount of customers the cashiers got. The cashier with the highest amount is... Oishi Saori-san! Excuse me. Saori is a Tsundere. She's just proud but not delicate. But on the surface she looks very calm. But in reality she always has a small theater of delusions playing in her head. Excuse me. (Congratulations on getting first place) But in reality she always has a small theater of delusions playing in her head. Excuse me. (Congratulations on getting first place) Thank you! Let's fly a helicopter to the yacht. We can take my yacht on a cruise to the farthest place. That is all. Alright, please get ready to open the store. Yes! It is Monday October 2nd. Today's special offer is... The manager will tell us. Oishi-san. Oishi-san! Yes? Congratulations! Umm... Will you let me celebrate this occasion with you? I know a good restaurant. I know more about these kinds of things then the manager. Okay. Yoshio. It seems like Takahashi asked me out on a date earlier. Really? Should I go? Although he is my boss, I'm probably older than he is. It's okay! I don't mind though... He may care though! Hey Saori. You were an idol in your teens so that's why.. You've never been in a relationship right? That's why.. I wonder if you even know that much about love? The manager Takahashi seemed like a really serious dude. She's probably thinking "A guy like that is really nice" Your name is Yoshio! Because your face looks really silly and cute. And it looks like you are a really good tempered cat. This might be the thing that I've been lacking the most in my life. It's kinda like... I'm a high school girl having the time of her life when she gets a job for the first time! A high school girl? I've never done that kind of thing after all. Now I'm doing these things after all this time? Well... I know a little bit about it. I think it's gonna be good! If you compare yourself to your complaining manager.. You are like a ray of sunshine! Saori used to be an idol! It was a 5 member group called Sunnies. Umm... Saori! You are Saori from Sunnies right? No, you definitely are! She was in Sunnies? I remember that group! Isn't it unsuitable for an idol to work here? That's why... She runs into these types of people. Your total is 8974 yen. Umm... We are going to have a barbecue by the riverside. You are welcome to come afterwards. Your change is 1026 yen. How about it? What's your answer? Forget about it. It's fine, it's fine. What the hell? She should at least give you an answer. There has to be an irreplaceable dream in front of you. From the stage, yes! We'll cross the romantic crossroads. This song "Romantic crossroads" was ranked number 3 but... After that the sales weren't too good. Bathing in the spotlight These are the romantic crossroads The miracle will continue Dreaming! Nobody's going to stop us now. Let's go! On these romantic crossroads I'll meet you there! On these romantic crossroads, I'll meet you... This group broke up after 3 years. Congratulations! I see! I understand! I'll leave it to you! What a bummer for Sunnies. People just started to know who they were and they are going to disappear already.. You are Saori right? Yes! What are you going to do from now on? I'm talking about tomorrow! Tomorrow! Tomorrow! I'll give you some ideas. There is still some time. Okay! Thanks for waiting! That meal was so yummy! That's true! (Of course, that is my best dish!) My husband is coming home late so do you wanna come over? Then I'll call my family and let them know! I'll tell them that I'm out eating. Shall we go to a restaurant? Otherwise we'll have to wash the dishes afterwords! There's that too! Oishi-san! Do you want to eat dinner with us Oishi-san? Even if you invite her, she won't go. She's young so she must be busy! That person will definitely come again! I mean..she's really good at singing! Is she your type? Well... But like...I feel like I've seen her before somewhere... Does anything come to mind sir? Is that right? One day I can say it, I can say it, I can say it. I got to find someplace to let me go. Because baby I don't want to cry. I got to find someplace to let me go. Because baby I don't wanna cry. I'm still singing this? How nice. I sang it again today. Under the train viaduct. I sang it and sang it. Huh? What is that? What is that? That's really fast! Super fast! That's awesome! But it's a little... Can't I smile? Weren't you always in the corner of the classroom not saying a word? Well, that's true. Oishi-san. Oishi-san! Oishi-san! Yes? Here! Nakayama Honoka. She's a third year in high school. Have her take out the things in her bag. You want me to? Well, you are a woman too aren't you? Otherwise it will be very troublesome...(I'll just take them out. I don't really care.) You're not hiding anything else are you? I'm going to call your parents so give me their phone number. Nobody is at my house so my uncle's phone number will be fine right? That's fine right? Please don't ask me! You are beautiful Miss. Excuse me? You're not wearing fake eyelashes. Why are you working in a place like this? It's because I like it. You like to work as a super market cashier? If you tried hard you could become one too! I wonder? That's right. You can't do math huh? Shut up...you hag. Gogh! Gogh!? You came fast... I'm Gotou Tamatsu. Ah, Tamaotsu huh? And So Gogh is your nickname like the singer! How funny! Gotou Tamotsu is Gogh huh? Hono! What are you doing stealing? She stole some chocolates. It was just some cheap stuff. Cheap stuff? If I would have known earlier I wouldn't come and pick you up! You are going to say that? I got this from my Mom but do you want it? I'm very sorry! Did we say that you could leave? I'm sorry! Those two... What's up with them I wonder? Is this all the cat food for today? It's kinda like... She gave him money didn't she? She calls him Gogh. Is he a painter? He had yellow paint all over himself. That's right! It was yellow. He could be color blind and only use yellow paint. And maybe he doesn't even know what the other colors like red are! He's like a cat! You know what? How about you give me some more cat food? Just toss that crap in there! And they might live in a tiny house in the mountains! And it's probably painted all yellow! And also! That's right! They have cats too! He probably picks up cats around there. The girl steals things because she likes Gogh! She wants to be close to him! That's why she told us that she wants him to come pick her up! That's a possibility! That might be it! But he's so addicted to his yellow paintings that he doesn't notice her feelings at all! That's why she is sad! She's sad but she is sure tough! She probably poses on the sofa for him! Geez! You don't even know colors yet you still paint! Isn't this a little strange? You don't even know colors yet you still paint! Isn't this a little strange? She would say something like that! But Gogh continues drawing! But he sure is nice to the Calico cat that he raised! He even named it Kiro(Yellow) He cherishes the cat like it was his son! Kiro...You and I see the same yellow world. I'm Yoshio though! And then! And then! That cat was probably a stray that he picked up! On a rainy day, he found that cat! (Are you going to die?) Let's live! Live! And then he picked up the cat! And then the cat let out a really big sneeze! And a ton of snot came out! But Gogh was very kind and just smiled. It's those guys again? I already told you not to play around there! For crying out loud! It makes me very happy to see you in good health Saori! When we were eating sushi earlier... Why did you divide the tuna? You like tuna don't you? Or maybe you don't. It was a waste to get it. What a great day today! Hey, if you are always stuck inside the supermarket.. You'll get sick! From now on how about we go out together once a week? Kiro! Oishi-san! What's wrong? It's nothing! You're worn out aren't you? But...it feels good out here! You worked up a sweat so...how about you take a shower? Okay.. Why don't you come to my house today? Ah sorry...I made plans today... Is that right? When I came here from the head office I would often meet up with my friends from my school days. They all live around here after all. A stray cat? I wonder... Maybe it came in here by mistake. I will take it out later. Ouch! It got me pretty good! Are you okay? What's up with that guy? What's the deal? I'm going to go back to work but, umm...I'll be back. Okay! Hey Yoshio! You can't do that! That guy is important to me! You can't attack him! After meeting you my luck has gotten better. When I left the hotel this morning the rain stopped. I also found the cover to the back of my remote! I feel like my heart is doing dances inside of my chest! But Saori! Shouldn't you see if he has any other women? He might be married! I wanted to eat together with him.. Am I too greedy for wanting to see meet him everyday? She's not listening to me. Saori! Don't tell me you are going to act like I don't exist when it suits your situation... I'll be with you forever. It doesn't matter who you fall in love with. Welcome! How many of you are there today? Five! How long are you going to be singing for? 2 hours! (Okay!) I want to sing that song! The romantic crossroads one! There it is! The Sunnies one! For real? Who is that? Well..I only know Natsu... What? It's a girl? Who is she? Well, like I said. It seems like Takahashi is going out with Saori from Sunnies! I don't know! And how do you feel about her Kanae? She is his first candidate! Come on! So who is this Saori girl from Sunnies? Whatever! It's fine if you don't know! (What do you mean?) Isn't he pretty messed up? They're pretty drunk huh? Well..yeah..yeah.. Alright, I'll get your room ready! (Thank you!) What are you saying? I want to sing the theme song of the TV series! I don't know that one! I'm telling you! It's that drama! When was that drama made? You really don't know do you? More time! (More time...) Takahashi! You said something about Sunnies. Don't tell me that you are going out with some gay old dude! Hey! I'll meet you at the romantic crossroads! I danced in the romantic crossroads! I'll meet you at the romantic crossroads! Yoshio... You're the only one I have! Yoshio! You're the only one I have! Yoshio! Yoshio! Saori! Yoshio! Time for dinner! You must have been so lonely...sorry! Saori! Together...I want to be together with you! Saori..I want to see you! Yoshio! You're the only one I have! I.. I..couldn't protect you! I couldn't protect...you.. Hey everyone! Look at that! What is it? What is it? Is he dead? He got up! He's alive isn't he? (He's alive!) Hello! What is your name? Wait...do you have a name? I'm...I'm Yoshio. Yoshio! Yoshio! Are you a human or something? Hey! I'm a human! How pitiful! Delusional cats like him exist! Your owner was very good to you. Mine was too! My owner gave me the name Masuharu! But it seems like they have forgotten to feed you recently though! What a good name! I have somewhere where I need to be! I'll see myself out! I'm glad I met everyone! See you guys later! What was that? What are you doing? What was that? What are you doing? I will get the smell of wild cats on me! For crying out loud! (That was so rude!) Hey! Take me with you! Are you hurt by any chance? Let me see! This is pretty bad! Were you abandoned by your owner? No, my owner loved me but I was thrown out! It was that thing. It was because of jealousy? Yeah, that's it. It's because my owner loved me. It's good being loved. That's why I want to go back home. Hey. Can't you take me with you? I want to do that but... There is a person who's side I want to be by. I need to hurry! It's a person? Yeah. She's my lover! A human lover? Kiro! I see the same yellow world that you do. His name is Gogh! Gogh? Yeah. I feel like I've heard his name somewhere... I wonder...Is Gogh my lover too? No...you're a cat aren't you!? A cat and a human being lovers? Can't happen! Can't happen! Why? You're a cat too aren't you? (I'm a human!) That's true! Alright, I'll get going then! Yoshio! Yoshio! Yoshio! Kiro! Is this place really okay? Maybe... It should be the hill in front of the mountain. It seems really far away! What was that just now? What was that? What was that just now? I wonder if Gogh is looking for me? Gogh? I'm not talking about the famous painter! He is a painter though... Umm...Are you talking about Gotou Tamotsu? That Gogh? How do you know him? I see...he really did have a cat. What? What? Do you know him? Yoshio! Kiro! Yoshio! Do you wanna eat? Meat dumpling? Anko dumpling? I like meat dumplings! Sorry! There's raccoons nearby! You need to watch out for them! Raccoons? They are animals that eat cats... I know someone who was eaten by them! Hide! Hide! Kitty cats~ Kitty cats~ Who are they? They are humans who catch cats and then do experiments with human medicine on them! They do experiments for the sake of humans? Well...this country is so diverse I don't really know! There haven't been any cats who have made it back! I'm really sorry about all of this! For the sake of us humans....we sacrifice cats like you... That's true! That's how it is! You humans sacrifice us cats! Yoshio! Kiro! Saori! Yoshio! Saori! I didn't get into a relationship with you because you were an idol! I mean it! They were my friends from my school days! When I'm with them, I like to show off like a kid! You are upset about Kanae aren't you? She's in the past! He came out of nowhere and ran into me! You can't do that man! You have to watch where you are going! What the hell? What should we do? You used to be an idol? It was an idol group that used to be super popular. I was mostly just dancing in the corner though! Yoshio! Yoshio! Kiro? Kiro? It's not! It's not! They're dating! Shame on you! (Sorry about that!) Do you guys even know? Do you know what shame on you even means? Hey! Like I said...I'm human! I have a human lover! What are you saying? (Saori is a former idol!) She has her flaws but she is a good girl! There it is! (How long is he going to talk about her?) Tell me more! The first time we met...I was next to a transparent box with a lot of kittens. That's a pet shop isn't it? That's right! On that day... Saori was working as a cashier in the supermarket and she didn't have any receipt paper! So she bought some at the home center! And then she was approached by an old fan.. And she ran away from there! And then what? On that day I was moved from the transparent case to a metal cage! We met each other by a stupid lucky chance! So you're a cat then aren't you? Right? Like I said! Saori chose only me! You're just a normal cat! There's nothing wrong with that! How many times do I have to say that I'm human before you understand?(You're a cat bro!) But didn't a female owner buy you? She doesn't have a man because you won't leave her alone. When her ex-boyfriend screamed at you he called you a stray cat didn't he? Yeah you are pretty much right... Cats can't get involved in complicated human matters like that! I'm glad that you came roaming over here. That's true! (That's true!) You...who are you? I'm Kiro! I was thrown out by a jealous human being! I'm Yoshio! I'm a human! A human? What about you? Are you a cat? Or are you... You can call me whatever you want. You should be grateful! Amazing! Yoshio....It would be better if you understood...that you are a cat! You guys are bothering me! I've had enough of your jokes! Those kittens in that transparent box... You know what happens when they get big and don't get picked by humans right? Well, first they are placed in a cage on the floor. And what about after that? I was gone after that. Where did they take you? Well... You thought that you would be the next one to get picked. Cats will be sold off but humans won't always buy them. You are a human. That's what you want to believe. Is that wrong? I mean! Well, I mean...I'm Saori's lover and she is a human! She tells me that she likes me and wants to be together with me forever! She tells me that everyday after all! There are lonely humans who need cats for companionship. Lonely humans? Lonely? Gogh is probably that way too. Me too? Music is something that lonely people use to call out to each other. Saori? Lonely people created music to call out to each other~ Saori, Saori, Saori~ My cute lover~ We need each other~ We are calling out to each other~ Calling out? Is Saori lonely? Saori.... That was just an illusion! The real one is cuter! Hello? Yes...that is true... Are we being restructured? We're not. Just one time. I'm Natsu! I'm Milky! I'm Mirumiru~ Did everyone bring your energy? I'm RinRin! (Lucky Happy!) Doki! Put your hand on your shoulder. Hello~ I'm Saori~ We are...Sunnies! I'll meet you at the romantic crossroads~ I just want to get married now, but my boyfriend is going overseas next year. I don't want to cause more trouble for him. This is a compilation of my blog. You can take a look at it if you have nothing else to do. Amazing! There's books now that have compilations of blogs? There is! Please sit down and wait everyone. Thank you! Hey Natsu! Weren't you in that super popular drama? It was pretty big! (It was!) Sometimes I can make a cameo in a drama as a Sunnies member but... Right now I'm tired of only performing! Oh, that's right. What are you doing now Saori? I'm not sure yet. Oh, is that right? They want me to sing though... But I haven't decided yet. Is that right? I get that, I get that. I want to choose it. How nice! You still like to sing don't you? I think you can make a solo debut for sure! Thanks! It's Sasaki-san! It's been a while! How nice to see you! Long time no see! You guys are Sunnies? (Yes!) I sure did like you guys back then! Please take care of us! I sure did like you guys back then! Please take care of us! You haven't changed at all! I've always wanted to see you. I couldn't forget you. I've been working so hard trying to make shows. When I saw you, I thought to myself that you should be the one on TV. Really? Yeah. My TV show would be made with you as the main focus. Sasaki-san! It's been a while! Are you doing well? Do your best! Please! Hey, isn't that Biruru? I went and did Karaoke yesterday! Me too! You did? Get ready for shooting! It's the 2000 women idol group special! All the women idol groups who debuted in 1998 and disbanded in 2000 have come!

Only the group that wins will sing one of their songs! Calm yourselves down and shut up! We're sorry! Do you understand? This is a variety show!

That's a really famous one isn't it? Alright, show us your boards! Oh, there they are! Natsun wrote down Saorin? People like Miru and Rinrin are super annoying! Annoying? (What do you mean annoying?) Also when we go places it's troublesome to bring them. What do you mean? It's not troublesome! Let's make it clear! She said that you stole it didn't she? There's no way I stole it! Something that lame! She said that you stole it didn't she? There's no way I stole it! Something that lame! Your salary comes from the office... Now then! We will ask the next question! During those days when you guys were bathing in the spotlight... After you became idols on the stage... You guys will shine on this stage again! Please tell us what kind of work you are doing now! I wonder what kind of answers we will get? Please write them down everyone! (Yes!) There's all kinds of things on the boards! Rinchan! You made a brand? What kind of brand is it?

The last person is Tokiko from Sunnies! Do your best! The difference between the two girls is 4 points! If she can stay in the water for 5 seconds then it is Sunnies victory! I will do my best! Tokiko! Are you ready!? (Yes!) Tokiko-san! Do your best! Go! It's hot! It's hot! It's hot! Will you be the winner? Will you be the winner? There she goes! One, two, three, four, five! The winner is Tokiko of Sunnies! Congratulations! Sunnies is the idol group that will sing! Congrtualtions everyone from Sunnies! (Please!) You guys gave it your all to become the winners! We want to know how you feel right now! You are going to sing! Sing! Sing! We want to know how you feel right now! You are going to sing! Sing! Sing! I'm really happy! You are going to sing! Sing! Sing! I'm really happy! Just like that! Just like that! Just like that? Just like that! Please come here! Are we going to sing? (You're gonna sing!) Are you kidding me? Sunnies will sing "The romantic crossroads"! I'm really happy today! This is the end of the program! Look forward to it in another 20 years! Yoshio! Sorry! You must have been scared huh? Come in! Want some? Now that my leg is healed, I'm thinking of going to Gogh's place. I'm going to Saori's place! You're going to your lover's place? You fool! I've gotten to like this place a lot! But... I want to go over to Gogh's place and confirm my feelings for him once more. You guys are free. Amazing! They are free! That's how cats are right? We're free! (We're cats!) What do you usually do here? I speculate stocks. Like hell I do that! Why do you paint? There's no reason. I just paint. It's just like breathing to you? Yeah, something like that! It's just like eating ramen! How about you? There should be something you want to do. I saw the TV program. Do you still want to sing? Sing. Then...do you want to go and sing? Welcome! Thanks for waiting! Hey! Sing! Here's a Sunnies song! Let's go with this one! My singing part was just a small little part! I know! I saw you on TV after all! I'll sing those parts! You sing the main part! Wait! Wait! I get it! Just hold on a second! That was pretty amazing! There has to be a dream that you will never give up. Say yes on the stage! That is the romantic crossroads! Be myself! The end of the road leads to tomorrow! Bathing in the spotlight, this is the romantic crossroads! Let's continue this miracle! Dreaming! Let's walk on this red carpet and then ascend onto these flights of steps! Take a step forward and the signal will change! My 17 year old heart beats faster! I can do it! If we extend our hands we can barely touch our fingertips! I want to grab your hand and go farther into the future with you! Nobody is going to stop us now! Come on! I met you on these romantic crossroads! What's wrong? Are you okay? Don't touch me! Do you know how much I practiced the part that you were going to sing? Do you know how nervous I was to sing? There's no way I wouldn't know! Even you think I'm just some idol! Don't make fun of me! I'm not! Everyone is like that! Everybody misunderstands me! They don't know what singing means to me! That's what you think of yourself right? You are an idol.. Yet, you feel embarrassed and like you are standing in the corner! Sorry about this. I'm sorry! Let's go home! I don't want to! I still want to sing! Why are you acting all high and mighty? I'm going home. You open your big mouth and then you are just going to go home and paint all day! We're going! We're going! I don't want too geez! Your lovely niece buys you with money. Did you forget? Here you go! This is your hush money! Has that painting been bought yet? I guess not. It's still not finished yet. You mean all of them? (Yeah.) Have you ever finished one? You need to finish one then sell it to a gallery! People are going to judge it and ridicule it! It's going to be treated cheaply! Even with all of that...have you ever thought about being a pro? You have to interact with people you don't like. Whether or not they are liars or have twisted fetishes and hobbies. Anything is fine! Regardless of all of that I still wanted to continue. That's how it is! I've been embarrassed many times! Many times! I wanted to sing after all! I did anything just so I could sing! Hey! Do you understand that? I understand. There's no way that you understand! I understand! You are tired of being known as a prostitute artist. The more you do it, the more you lose hope. You beat yourself up right? You forced yourself to go on a variety show and did a lot to get your own show. But all of it was cut out. You were asked by the producer Sasaki to go out with him. You dated him but he never did make your TV show did he? In order for you to stay... You did all kinds of things. Then you think "What was the reason for me doing all of this?" This kind of helplessness eats away at you. You just...you just lock yourself in your room. And nobody calls or checks up on you. And when you lie down.... You hear laughter outside and you cover your ears. Even something like drinking water becomes a chore! You are fed up with looking outside and seeing the blue sky! Even pulling up your curtains is hard. You feel like everything is so annoying. You got on a bus from Tokyo to Kosaka. And you came to a town nobody knows about right? If you worked at a supermarket there.... Then you could become the number one cashier. What's up with you? Are you crazy? Why do you smile when you want to cry? The wind gets stronger... It gently strokes your back.. The small birdies come back home from the sunset. They are starting their journey. The sunset has an evening glow. That person's face is glowing. I need to go on a trip. I need to accept this. At the end of the universe... I know that you have endless freedom. Tens of thousands of years later The movement of the planet will overlap. The other one looks like a bear. Maybe I just didn't notice it. Tens of thousands of years later. The movement of the planet will overlap. The other one looks like a bear. Maybe I just didn't notice it. The border will be shaken again. Every time when you look back. Like the sunlight that penetrates the leaves. It gently swings. The border will be shaken again. Every time when you look back. Like the sunlight that penetrates the leaves. It gently swings. I've never seen Saori's face this way before. Farewell. I'm....a cat aren't I? What are you doing? He's painting a picture. I guess I'm modeling for him. Amazing! Sorry. I... didn't turn out as good as you thought I would. If I endured it more... If I tried harder.... Someday I could say that things turned out well. That's what I thought but it didn't turn out that way. Before I realized it... I found myself coming to this unknown place. I'm always so confused. Everything is so confusing. I'm really... You're beautiful! I'll become that beautiful someday. Compliment me more! What the heck? Whatever! Compliment me more! In the end, we cats need to adapt to being alone. Right now we are all gathered together but... In the daytime everyone goes their separate ways. We are all individuals. You too! Why are you looking like that? You look like you are going to cry. You really are hopeless! Knock it off! There's no helping him! Knock it off! There's no helping him! Yoshio! What's that? Yoshio! Is it a human? (It's a human!) A human! (A human!) Hey, hey...

Yoshio... Those two certainly are lovers! Now everyone. Please give those two a big applause for their reunion and happiness! It's too bad. Even if we put our hands together.. We can't make a big sound. We can't put our paws together very well. That's why...hurry up! The magic is about... I know! I'll find us a house. Now then...please ask the newlyweds to cut the cake. Congratulations! Just stay like that! Thanks! If you'd like. Please wish these two happiness. The meat in Chinatown is very good! Yeah. That's true. I was invited to sing for these customers. It's just a part-time job but.. Do you wanna come and sing? Good smile! Such a wonderful night. Such a beautiful smile. I can't help myself! Such a beautiful smile. I can't help myself! Welcome! Umm... I saw the help wanted sign on the door. Let me get the manager really quick! Cat food cake, dog food cake. You guys have milkshakes right? Yes! Our shop always has a milkshake. That brings back the memories! What should we do? Should we get one? I want one. Then, I guess I'll have two! Okay, understood! She quit being an idol and she quit working at the supermarket.
