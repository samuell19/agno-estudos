Dad, come on. Kay and I are ready. Okay. I'm coming. Let's go see what Santa... Come on, honey. Come on. Okay. Okay. All right, here we go. Well merry Christmas, mom. Merry Christmas. Hey, what the heck are... Okay honey, it's been 15 minutes. -Are these presents? -Let's just get right to it. Okay, okay. Hey guys. All right. Say hi Abbie! Hi Kayden! Dad, dad, look at the presents Santa left us. Can I open one now? Wow. Woah bud. Wait, wait. Did you want to hold the camera? Can I try, dad? Yeah. Here you go. Be careful. Wait, Kayden! Why are you asking us these questions!! My son clearly did nothing wrong. Mr. Peterson, please. I also want what's best for Kayden. I, I still, I still don't understand why we need to do this right now. We need to provide an evaluation to the police as soon as possible. As Kayden is still 17, it's important that I speak with both of you so I get a better sense... No, but listen. He's going to wake up and he is not going to know where he is, and he is, he is not going to understand. He will be so scared. Please. I need to be there when he wakes up, Mark. I need to be there when he wakes up. I need to be there when he wakes up! Okay. Abbie? Sorry, what was the question? How often did your father work those weekend shifts? Why does that matter? Abbie, all of my questions are to help me get a better sense of your family's situation. As you're not Kayden's legal guardian you don't have to speak with me if you don't want to. No. I want to answer your questions to help my family. I just wasn't expecting you to be passing judgement on... No one here is being judged. My dad rarely worked weekends. We spent tons of time together as a family. In no way did that impact Kayden. Is that the real question? Will anything I say here even matter? Of course. Your parents spoke a great deal about how you're a major part of your brother's life. What I'm trying to understand is how in the last few months, in light of your absence, how it may have impacted Kayden as to where he is today. So, you think this is my fault? Not at all. But you're sitting here asking us questions like we did something wrong. I'm just trying to under... Like something we did could've changed it. I'm hoping to understand how this incident happened today so that we can help him. Can I go to the bathroom? Hello? Abbie, are you there? You were calling me? I've been trying to get a hold of you. You were starting to worry me. I'm sorry, it's just not a good time right now. Abbie, I just want to talk. Please. How are you? I miss you. Abbie? I'm sorry, it's just really not a good time right now. Abbie what's going on? You can tell me. Are you okay? Yup. I'm fine. I'm sorry. I gotta go. Mom's calling me. Abbie wait! Sorry. Kayden was diagnosed when he was three. Abbie was five. They've always been best friends, ever since the day she first held him. That's wonderful. In many of my cases the sibling dynamic can be quite challenging. They always had a special bond over art, drawing, painting, whatever they could get their hands on. That's what Abbie went to school for in California. This is incredible. Oh Abbie, we're so proud. Full ride. What exactly does that mean? Full ride. It means my tuition is paid for. Okay, mom... Tuition's paid for, but not books or housing probably. Books are expensive, housing... California's not cheap. I'm just saying. Yeah, but California design academy has one of the top programs in animation. It's basically the Harvard of arts. Well Harvard is also very expensive. Okay. We can make it work. We'll make it work. Yeah. We'll make it work. Good job, kiddo. Hey Kay. What you doing? Ooh. A sea lion. Why a sea lion? Hey, you want to see something funny? This is funny. It is funny. Good job. Your drawings are the best, Kay. Seriously. We're going to make an awesome TV show one day. But I have to go away for a bit to make that happen. I have to... Go to school for it. You know, like how you go to school? I love you so much. You know that, right? Make his nose a bit smaller. He's starting to look like grandpa. Mark? What's wrong? I don't know. I'm just worried. About Abbie? Or Kayden? Both. This is a big change. Yeah. It's not ideal. But this is what we wanted, right? This is what we worked so hard for. For Abbie to have her own life? Of course. Of course. But this is all Kayden knows. And now he's going to be alone? I mean, Abbie is the only friend he's ever had. Well, he is capable of adapting. And I'll be able to spend more time with him. And what are you going to be doing after school now? The same thing I did when she was a kid. Take it one day at a time. You know, I really think that it's time that we talked about assisted living. What? You're something else, you know that? Tish! Assisted living?! Look, this, it's an option that we haven't explored. Hell, we haven't even talked about it! Because we don't need to! Yet! We don't need to... yet! No. I'm not... No, Mark. I'm not talking about this with you. I'm not talking about this tonight. I'm sorry, okay? But today was a big wake - up call. This discussion is over. We always knew Abbie was going to leave and we always knew he was going to have this problem. I just didn't think it was going to happen this sudden. You and I both know he's not going to understand. How many hours a week did Abbie look after Kayden when she was home? Hard to say. I mean, Abbie would hang out with Kayden while I ran errands or did things around the house. Weekend outings were always as a family. Abbie always wanted to spend time with Kayden. That's quite the commitment for a young girl. She's quite the girl. Can you tell me more about the transition? Abbie leaving home? Well, it was hard on all of us. Technology helps, I guess. Now let me see. Oh, yes. Thanks. It's not much of a tail. But I'm sort of attached to it. Eeyore, I have got an idea. Hey, eeyore's in my spot. Stupid thing's broken. What's wrong? Well, I'm trying to set up the face time so we can all video chat together. It's face time, not "the face time." Kayden, pass this to your sister, please. Kayden, pass it. Kayden got it. Huh. Thank goodness I have you to take care of me. Abbie, I can see my face. I don't want to face time with my face. Yeah, you, you have to face time me if you wanna... Oh good, let's do it. What's your phone number? Nope. I know. Hold on. Okay, and go. Kayden, look who's here. Abbie. Hey buddy. Ready to go? I hear someone's going to California. Your mom could not stop raving when she was here. Yeah, I'm pretty excited. We'll sure miss seeing you here every day after school. I think it's Kayden's favourite part of the day. You want your headphones for the hall? Kayden, what did I say yesterday? It's too loud. Seatbelt. Kayden, I don't have time for this. I have to go home and pack. Kayden. Please? Not on our last day. Stop! Ready? -Five... -Five. -Four. -Four. -Three. -Three. -Two. -Two. -One. -One. Thank you. Tigger, I'd be happy to tell you my secret for winning at... You would. Mom, have you seen my sketchbook? She's upstairs. I like winnie the pooh. Nice. I like winnie the pooh, too. Who's your favourite? Eeyore. You know, the only reason that he is your favourite is because your sister used to carry eeyore everywhere. You all packed? Yep. You didn't over pack though, right? Because they will charge you if your bag's overweight. No, it's barely even full. Good. Well, make sure you text us when you land, and when you get to your dorm, you know where it is on campus? I think so. I've been talking to my roommate, Jen. She explained it to me. She seems really nice. Kayden? Give this to Abbie. Mom, no! You said "no presents, mom." But it's not every day that your baby girl's going off to California, so... Mark. Wow Kayden, did you write this? It's awesome printing. I had to steal your book so I could tape his drawings in. We thought it would be nice for you to have it with you always. Thank you. You have your phone? Yep. And all the numbers are programmed in? Yep. Okay, so text when you get through security, and then text before the plane takes off. And then when you get there you should... Get in the first person's Van that offers me a ride? Mom, relax. Well, you know, it may be hard to say no if they offer me candy. Abbie. Just kidding mom. All right, well... Work hard and stay safe. I can do that. I love you so much. Will you please come back to us even after you're famous? I'm only going to be gone for four months. You'll barely notice. No. Ah, bud, remember. Dad said that Abbie is going on the airplane, and she's going to school. But she'll be back to see you soon. We'll Mark it off on the calendar on the fridge, okay? I will go on airplane. Just Abbie's getting on the plane today buddy. But I'll be home before you know it. I'll be home soon, okay? Just make sure you send me lots of pictures. Oh no! Not now, okay? It's time to go, kiddo. Love you guys. I will go on airplane. Abbie. Come on, bud. Flight 262 service to Los Angeles is now inviting passengers, to board... Hey, you must be Abbie. Jen. Hey. Nice to finally meet you. Nice pictures. Damn, you came prepared. Well, my mom used to be an interior designer, so, I guess, I got that gene. Is that Kayden? Yep. Oh, so cute. Okay so, my friend, Robbie, that I was telling you about I guess knows this guy, Brooke, and they're throwing this insane party for the beginning of the semester, they invited me, it's on Friday if you want to come. Uh, I don't know. I'm going to have to see. Oh. Did I phrase that as a question? Because it's actually not optional. Okay, fine. I'll go. Cool. Yes, you will. All right. When did you move here from blue water? I don't know, 2002? And the reason for the move? Work. I'm a construction foreman. I imagine it's very long hours in construction. I manage just fine. How long have the two of you been together? Twenty-four years. Can I have a tissue, please? I'm sorry. Could we please do this later? I would really like to be there when he wakes up. I know this is hard. No. Hard doesn't even begin to cover it. I know that you think that you understand but you don't. It's, it's... Nothing prepares you for it. You, you, you just hit the ground running. Abbie. Abbie. Abbie. Kayden. Kayden, calm down. Alright, alright... Kayden, calm down buddy. Sweetheart. Kayden. She's not here. Abbie! Abbie! Kayden. Enough. Enough! Kayden. Look at me. I have an idea. Yeah. Thank you. That's the last of the eggs. I'll pick some up on the way home from work. Okay. Hey Kayden. Do you want anything special for dinner tomorrow? Chicken strips. Chicken strips it is. Is that good? Okay, that's enough, bud. Did Kayden seem to be affected by Abbie's absence? Well, I mean, we did explain to him that she was going away to school. It's hard for him to Gauge what that time is, as you can imagine. Yes, but over the last few months, did you notice a change in his mood or behavior? I saw in his past charts that he had some previous incidents at his high school. If you're implying that what happened today had anything to do with Abbie's absence affecting my son's behavior, you are way off. I mean, of course we missed her while she was gone, but that had nothing to do with what happened today! My son did nothing wrong. Mr. Peterson. I am just trying to get a better understanding of Kayden's trajectory over the past year. He was fine. I mean, of course he missed her, but what do you expect? Mom, you have to tilt the camera up. I can't see you. What? Oh. So, how is your roommate? Are you getting along? Uh, yeah. I mean it's only been a week but she's nice. Good. Uh, she invited me to a party that's tonight. I don't know if I'll go. Abbie, Kayden's touching noses with you. I should head to class now. Well, let us know if we can talk to you tonight. Kayden put in a special request for chicken strips. No fair. I never get chicken strips. Okay, I should go. Okay, um, Kayden, say bye to Abbie. Bye! Love you guys. You okay? Yeah. Yeah, it'll be okay. Abbie. Abbie. I think I'm going to pull Larry and his three from that job after the 4th they can finish off the molding. We'll see you at white stone next week then. Yeah, sounds good. Hey uh, how's family? Good. Abbie's getting settled in in California. I mean, 10 grand a semester room and board. Can you believe that? Ooh. Ain't that a mess. Yeah. I could use a few extra hours if you have anything. Ah, we got the build on Fraser. As long as you don't tell Ms. Tish that I'm the one taking you away on Saturdays. She's expecting it. Thanks Henry. All right. Take care. Are you serious, Mark? I'm sorry. We ended up working late on site and I must've forgot. I want chicken strips. Kayden, stop. Hungry. Chicken strips. Great. Why didn't you just cook him something else? I told you I was busy on site. No. You didn't tell me anything. I didn't hear anything from you all day. That would require you to actually pick up your phone! Okay, change your tone. He's been talking about this all day. And we were going to call Abbie. It's a thing. Fine, fine. I'll go get some. It's not that big of a deal. Abbie! Forget it. Kayden? Go upstairs to your room and draw while mom cooks dinner. Kayden, please. Eggs? No? Great. Cheese toast it is. Good movie, huh Kayden? How about mom makes us some hot chocolate? Okay. Why didn't you just let him watch a movie like I said? He needed a break from electronics. He was fine. Doctor Palmer specifically said "less electronics." So now we have to start that tonight? Well maybe if he wasn't so glued to his screen he would be having a better night. Tish, that's not why... No, Mark. The reason that he's having a bad night is because his dad couldn't be bothered to pick up the fucking chicken strips! Enough with the fucking chicken strips! Hey, Kay. You want to play a game on your phone? Hey Kayden. I have an idea. How about we call Abbie? I will see Abbie. Okay. I have to pee. Oh, my god. I'm so sorry. Are you okay? Karly, come on. Uh, did you need to go? Hey, hey, don't be that guy. Oh, I was just... Hang up and hang out. New rule, uh, if you're not peeing you're dancing. Let's go. Okay. Excuse us, thank you. She's not picking up. Okay. Well, try her again. Maybe she's already gone to bed. Yeah, we should've just let him be. I know. I thought it would help distract him. Kayden. Kayden, calm down. Kayden. We're going to have to try and talk to Abbie tomorrow. Kayden! Not a fan of Brooke? Who? The guy you just blew off. This is his house. Uh, no. Um... I just didn't feel like dancing. Oh. That's too bad. Why? Um, well I was going to ask you to dance. But you don't feel like it. So it's fine. I actually really do like this song. Kayden! He's going to hurt himself. She's not here. Kayden, sit down. Kayden, listen to me. Hey, listen, listen, listen, listen! -Five... -Five. -Four. -Four. -Three. -Three. -Two. -Two. -One. -One. I'll check it before I go to bed next time, sorry. Yeah. I'll face time Kayden after class. I love you too. Bye. I'm guessing you had a good night. You know, um, it was almost as good as yours. I have no idea what you're talking about. Okay. So, a tall sultry woman doesn't ring any bells. Karly. She's a friend of Brooke's. Okay. So, when's the first date? There isn't going to be a first date. Really. It was just a kiss. Seriously. Okay, well I am seriously starving. So, can we please get some brunch? But don't worry. It's just brunch. I am hungry. Great, then get up. Let's go. Ow. -I'm tired though. -It's mimosa time. I'm tired. So tired. That sucks. Will you pick me out an outfit? Absolutely not. I'm so tired. I will drag you out of bed. I take spin classes. I'm very strong. Just wear that. Let's go. Up and at 'em. Let's go, come on. -Hi tish. -Hi. He wouldn't sit with me. So, did Emily give you the details? Just that he gave someone a push. Yeah. Another student reached for his headphones. So, my son was being bullied. We believe it was a misunderstanding. Kayden apologized. Didn't you, Kayden? Sorry. Look. These things happen. But Mrs. Thompson has her hands full as it is, and she just can't manage. So, maybe you could just take him home for the day. Kayden. Kayden. Not now, okay? Kayden, hey. Let's get you home okay? Okay? Kayden? Let's go home. It's time to go home bud, okay? Abbie. Kayden. Kayden. Now. Did you talk to Abbie this weekend? Yeah. She seems a little homesick. I wish we could have her home for Thanksgiving. You know we can't afford that. Yeah. Awesome, bud. Just go grab some pasta down the aisle. So, I was thinking that maybe we could ask the robertsons to look after Kayden on Sunday. Just one. Just one. Thank you, big guy. Okay, tomato sauce next. Sauce. Just down the aisle. We can go see Greenville. Greenville? It's a group home in borrowton. Maybe we can get some extra help. I can ask if there's... It wouldn't hurt to go look. One day at a time, right? Kayden? Kayden? Kayden? Kayden? Kayden? What else did you do today? Mom told me that you did some more drawings today. Can you show me? Kayden, can you show me? Kayden, can you show me? Okay, bud I gotta go. But I'll... I'll talk to you tomorrow, okay? Love you. Hey stranger. Hey. What are you doing here? I... I part-time ta for a journalism class. How you been? Good. You? Pretty good. Except I, I did have a rough past couple weeks 'cause I met this really awesome girl and she never texted me back. Yeah, i'm... I'm sorry about that. I've just been a little bit overwhelmed with the first couple weeks of school and catching up on assignments. Did you draw that? Yeah. I'm in the animation program. Shut up. You're so cute. Oh, I'm cute? I really am sorry though. For... not texting you back. Well, there is a way you could make it up to me. Really? Any plans Friday? What's that for? Just going to the beach. Someone's got a date. Jen, come on. Please tell me it's the girl from the party. Seriously? Just drop it. Okay. I think we're a little past the point of roommate deception. It's not like you haven't seen me coming in at 3:00 am from Brooke's, so. Seriously, is it her? Oh, my god, you really like her. Maybe a little. Yeah. This is too great! I'm so excited for you. Very nice. Okay. I got this. Make good choices. Or not. The latter is more fun. -Hey. -Hi. Hey. Um, I'm Cooper. You must be the Petersons. I'm Mark. My wife, tish. Hi. I'm actually head of admin, but they needed an extra hand on the weekends, so you got me. Jackie said you wanted to see the space? Yeah. This is Mark's only day off and our son is with a family friend. Got it. Come on in. So, um, this is the main floor. It's mostly common area. And over here we have the kitchen... Woah, woah, woah. Daniel, Daniel, please take a seat. No more coffee until you have your medication, okay? Sorry about that. As I said, short-handed on the weekends. Uh, the kitchen is just this way. This is the backyard. We like to engage our residents in gardening and other outdoor activities. Um, I think that woman needs help? Oh. Maggie, not again. Maggie, Maggie, we don't pick our scabs. Okay, I'll be right back. Oh. That doesn't look good. Here. You want a band-aid? Yeah? As I said, we're here to help. So, we'll do anything we can to accommodate Carl's needs. Uh, Kayden. Kayden. Uh, right. Sorry. I'll follow up with you both. There's a lot more logistical questions having to do with the health insurance and whatnot. Okay. Next time you can bring Kayden by and he can take a look at the place. Okay. Um, it was good meeting you. Did you ever consider a group home? No, because Kayden can only live in our home. And how would you describe your home? More than just a home. I mean, for Kayden it's more than just a roof over his head. It's his whole world. Thanks again. They don't do anything. They just sit around all day, and when you get home they don't even care. You might as well have a fish. I'm sorry, but what did cats do to you to deserve such animosity? They didn't. Dogs are just inherently better. You can take them for walks, and you can play with them... Okay, we're going to have to agree to disagree on this one. So, do you want food now or food later? Wow. And whoever said chivalry is dead? Hey, food is the foundation of any good date. So, it's food now or food later. It's that simple. So, this is a date? Do you kiss a lot of girls at parties? No. Then it's a date. Is there enough? I think so. So, uh, what brought you down to la? The program. I like their animation track. There's nothing really like it back home. And what's home like? Uh, you know. The usual. Overworked dad, overstressed mom, and my brother is in his last year of high school. Oh, nice. Does he know what colleges he's applying to? Uh, actually, I'm not sure. So, what was it like growing up in la? It's all I know. It was just me and my mom. My dad left when I was 7, came out when I was 14, she threw me a party. That's a good mom. Yeah. I'm lucky. My friends were all so cool about it. I even brought a girl to prom. So, what about you? Any ex-girlfriends I need to worry about stealing you away? No, definitely not. I mean, I've, I've been with a few girls before. But nothing serious enough to call a girlfriend. So no, you have nothing to worry about. So, how long did you and that ex from prom go out for? About a year and a half. When we graduated she got into this college in New York and she broke up with me because she didn't want to do long distance. I'm sorry. Don't be. Look where I am now. What was that for? Oh, you got a little something right here? Oh, oh yeah? You have a little something. Yeah? Yeah where? Right here. Well, well, well. What do we have here, miss "this isn't a date?" Very funny. Uh, Jen, this is Karly. Hi. Well don't mind me, lovebirds. Uh, I'm just going to go meet Robbie at the campus center. I just have to change clothes. I'll only be a few minutes. I should probably take this. Okay. Hi mom. Hi sweetie. Sorry, I missed your call last night. That much homework, even on the weekends? Yup. Oh. We're really proud of you. Thanks, mom. We're really, really proud of you. So, what's up? Oh, not much. Just tidying around the house. Kayden went to see a movie over at the robertsons. Oh, that's nice. Did he have fun? I'm not sure, I think so. Your dad and I didn't stay. We went to tour Greenville, a group home. I, I don't see him there. But we thought it was best to at least do the research. Did you call just to tell me this? I just... You don't bring up care homes our entire lives and then I'm gone for what, like two months, and you start shopping for a place to send Kayden off to? Sweetheart, no. Abbie, this has nothing to do with you. Kayden is almost 18 and he is... How can you say it has nothing to do with me? Abbie please, you know, you have always... I can't do this right now, mom. I gotta go. Abbie? Abbie? Mom, dad said that Kayden and I could paint our coloring books after the movie. But now he's saying Kayden's going to bed. Well, he's probably going to bed because he's really tired. Do you want me to paint with you? No, it's okay. I'll wait for Kayden tomorrow. Okay. What's wrong, mummy? Come here. Do you remember when we talked to Kayden's doctor? Yeah, when you thought Kayden was sick. Is Kayden sick again? No honey. He's not sick. Kayden has a special thing called autism. It means that sometimes it's going to be harder for him to do things like school or chores, and sometimes he's not always going to be able to tell us what he needs or wants, so we're going to have to pay extra special attention to him. What it really means is that he is going to need a lot of extra love from his big sister. I can do that. I know you can. You are the best big sister there is. And sometimes mommy and daddy will need your help, and Kayden will need your help too. In school Mrs. Mitchell was telling us about the special parts in our body that help us live. This is my heart, my lungs, my stomach and my two kidneys. You are so smart. What if I gave Kayden my kidney. Would that help make Kayden better? You know sweetheart, I think that, that's not going to, that's not going to help with this. What... What Kayden needs from you is a lot... ...of love and hugs like you already do. Okay? He's pretty dependent on me and my family, he won't be going to college. We actually don't really know what he's going to do after high school. There aren't many options for him. Why didn't you tell me? I don't know, I guess it's kind of a lot of background to share on a first date. Wait... we were on a date? But seriously, I'm really glad you told me. My mom told me they went to visit a group home yesterday. They're insistent that I don't have to be his caretaker when I'm older even though I've always said I want to. They think it's going to ruin my life, so now that I'm gone they've already started looking at options as if I'm no longer an option. Sounds like your parents just want you to be happy. Yeah. I know it's tough for them. When my brother was first diagnosed, the doctor told my parents to... Go home and love your other child. Can you imagine that? Because they just assumed that he would have no future. See, that was a lot. This is why I should... Abbie. I'm really happy you told me. I mean, you must be close with your parents. Yeah, I'd say so. Have you come out to them yet? No. I want to, though. I just don't think it's the right time yet. So what kind of stuff does Kayden like to do? He is the most amazing artist. More inventive than me, really. Not bound by any rules or styles like they teach here. We love to draw together. We're going to make a TV series one day. Were you and Kayden always this close? Always. Some siblings struggle to connect at a young age. Did you ever find it difficult? No. It just always worked. Hello. Does Kayden have his phone? I just tried face-timing him. No. He forgot it at school. Do you want me to grab him? Yeah, okay. Sure. Hold on. Kay! Hey bud. How's it going? How was school? Good. Did you make some art today? Did you make some art today? Okay bud, I should go. But I'll talk to you later, okay? I love you. Hey. Why didn't you guys go to the school to get it? I don't know, I didn't have time. I'll grab it Monday. Well, Kayden needs his phone so him and I can talk. It's not the same without face time. Abbie, I don't know what you want me to say. Do you want me to grab him? He can use my phone? Dad, you don't get it. My brother and I need to be able to talk. He needs his phone. Okay, Abbie. No one gets it more than I do. But I can't just drop everything. How are you? Good. You? What's wrong? Nothing, um... Just... just really missing my brother. I'm sorry, babe. I just feel so guilty being here. Well, being here helped you meet me. And we all know that's the highlight of your university experience. I really like you, Abbie. I really like you too. I hope so, because that would've been really awkward. Kayden, hold out your hand. Okay, one, two, three. That's how much it costs for one bus ride. Three dollars. So, you're going to get on the bus, you're going to put that in the slot, you're going to take your seat, and you're going to get off at the grocery store. Like we did before, remember? You remember what the bus stop looked like, the big grocery store with the donuts you love? Dad. Bus. No, no, no. Kayden. Dad's, dad's going to follow the bus. This is just for practice for you to be able to do it by yourself. I will ride the bus. Yes. Kay, you will ride the bus. Look, everything's going to be okay. Dad's going to be right behind you. Hey kid. Kayden! Kayden. The money. Your headphones! In your backpack. Well, we should probably be productive today. It is already 4:00. I would say this is very productive. You want to study? Hmm. Gym? Can I ask you a question? Mm-hmm. Have you mentioned me to them yet? Not yet. Is it because I'm a girl? My dad would be intense, regardless if you're a guy or a girl. So, you're just not going to tell them? I just thought that maybe since we're more serious that you'd want them to know. I do. I want to. It's just with everything going on with Kayden, I don't want to put more on their plate. I'll tell them when the timing is right though. I promise. Hey. I'm not going anywhere if that's what you're worried about, okay? Okay. I say we go get cupcakes and go for a walk. Oh, so you went from the gym to cupcakes. Yeah. Or donuts. We have options. Okay, hold on. Hold on bud. Do you have the card I gave you? Okay good. So, this is an atm. Now what you're going to do is you're going to put the card into the machine, follow the instructions, and you're going to get out cash. Here we go. Please insert your card to begin. Hello. Kayden, it can't talk to you. It's just waiting for your card. Hi. Hey. So, I'm looking into flights. We better move quick here before the prices move up. Uh, I've got December 17th. I have my last final the day before. Can I get a couple days to say goodbye to my friends? Okay. How about, how about December 20th? Your friends allow you to leave then? Yeah. Thanks. Are you happy with how the first semester went? Yeah, it's been good. Good group down there? I wouldn't call it a group, but yeah, some friends. Any boys? No, dad. I'm just curious, you know. Wondering why you needed the extra days. Hey, I just wanted to say sorry for getting upset with you the other day. It's just been tough being away from Kayden. I understand, kiddo. It's okay. All right. I got your itinerary. I'll send it to you. Thanks, dad. All right. See you soon. Bye. So, the winning assignment gets to shadow professor watts for a weekend. I mean, there's a lot of competition, but, I think, I have a chance. What are you going to do? I have an idea I've started sketching, but... Hey babe. Is that Jen? Oh, it's Abbie's mom, hi. Abbie's told me so much about you. Uh, no. No mom. This is Karly. She's a... friend from class. I don't think I've mentioned her before. Hi Karly. Abbie's been telling me all about your class. Nice to meet you, Mrs. Peterson. Okay mom. We should probably start studying. I'll talk to you tomorrow, okay? Say hi to Kayden for me. Okay. Talk to you tomorrow. How are you? How was class? Which class? My journalism class or our animation class? I'm sorry. Just with Kayden struggling with me being gone and my dad taking an extra shift, I just... I didn't want to... Tell them about me? No, put more stress on my mom's plate. Didn't realize I was that stressful. No. I'm just saying that the idea of us might be stressful. I don't... I don't know how they'll feel about it. Yeah, well I don't know how I feel about it anymore either. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I... I just don't think it's the right time yet. It's not the same for me as it was for you, okay? It's not that simple. I just thought we were more serious than this. But, I guess, I was wrong. We are. You should want people to know we're together. You should be proud of me. I am proud of you. Oh, yeah? Well, it doesn't show. Me walking in on a call with you and your mom is the perfect time for you to be like, "hey mom, this is my girlfriend." No, it's not the perfect time! You don't understand anything that my family goes through. You never will. So, then what, you just never tell them about me? What about when you're done with school? Then what? I don't know. It depends... It depends on if you're going to stay or not. Stop. You know exactly why I would have to go home. So, was I just like a fun little experiment to you? How convenient. You know that's not true. Well maybe it'd be more convenient for you if we never met in the first place. Hey, you don't mean that. You don't mean that. Yeah, I can't do this, Abbie. Karly, please don't, please don't. Please don't go. No, I really can't. No. Fuck! Kayden? Kayden? Kayden. Stop. Stand over there. Hey. It's okay. It's okay, buddy. Kayden. It's okay. Kayden, stop. Mom's got it. Kayden. Sit now. Kayden! Mark. I've got it. There's eeyore. It's okay, sweetie. How am I supposed to function for the next three weeks without you? Well, you survived for the past 20 years, so I'm sure three weeks will be fine. Hmm. We'll see. Also, how did you get stuck with me instead of your girl taking you to the airport? I didn't ask her to. I think we might be done. Shit, I'm sorry. Does she know you're leaving today? Well she knows I'm going home for Christmas, but I don't think so. Well, her loss. We'll find you a cutie in the spring. Hey Kay. Wow. That looks great. How's it going, buddy? Hey, can you flip the camera back to your face, buddy? Mom, dad, can you help Kayden flip the camera back? Hey, so guess what? Abbie is getting on a plane to come home and see you. Chicken strips. Sure, we can have chicken strips. Abbie. All right. I gotta get on the plane, but I can't wait to see you. I love you. Hey. So, have you boarded yet? Yeah, I'm about to. Thanks for helping with Kayden. With what? Our face time call. What call? Our face time call? Weren't you in the room? No. Hold on. Hey tish, were you in Kayden's room when he was talking to Abbie? No. Why? No. No one was in his room, why? We just had a great conversation. Best one we've had in a long time. Felt normal, like we were together. That's really great. Mark, can you come up here please? Hey kiddo. Your mom's calling. Why don't you text me when you're on the plane? Okay. Talk to you soon. Love you. Bye. Mark, why didn't you wait? Pick up. Abbie. Airport. That's right, bud. Today's the day. What do you think we should do for dinner tonight, Kay? Chicken strips. Well, I think Abbie would be happy with that too. I will ride the bus. Chicken strips. Abbie. I will ride the bus. Chicken strips. Abbie. -Oh, really, bud? -No, sweetie. Hey now. Hey now what? We've been working on this for a while. And the store's just a few stops down. No, Mark. This is a big deal, him initiating it. No. Look, I'll follow the bus. Mark. I'll follow the bus. Mark, no. I'll follow the bus. Hey bud. Tell you what. Why don't I give you some money and you can buy Abbie some chicken strips? I will ride the bus, chicken strips, Abbie. Very smart, kiddo. All right, go up and grab your jacket and your wallet. You are really pushing it today. He had another meltdown just yesterday, he's having more and more problems at school, and now you're letting him ride the bus? I'll be right behind him, tish. No Mark, it's... Let's go, bud! I will ride the bus. Good job. So just like you did before with dad, okay? Three! That's right, $3. You got it, bud. Now I'm going to be right behind the bus and I'll meet you at the store. Kayden, slow. And you have your headphones in your backpack, okay? All right, you better get going. I'll see you at the store. Oh hey. Why don't we get Abbie some donuts? What do you say? I will see Abbie. Abbie is going to be so proud of you. Abbie! Excuse me, your bag? Hey, could you move your bag? Dude. Calm down, buddy. What's that you got there? What, you just come from a construction site or something? Or is the bus too loud for you? Hey, I'm talking to you, man. What's your problem? What's your problem?! Hey! Settle down back there. Hey listen to me when I'm talking to you, man. Why don't you take those stupid things off your head and talk to us, man? Hey dispatch... Hey, stop! Sir... Sir, calm down! Please stop! Stop that! Sit down! Where is he? He's in surgery. All right. Hey. Your, your mom just got here. I've got to go back to her. Some social worker's asking us questions. What? Why? Just grab a seat. No! I'm going to come with you. Come here. Come here. It's going to be okay. I promise. Just let me help, dad. Abbie. Just let your mom and I talk to her first, maybe you can talk to her later. All right? Just grab a seat. I can see that you love and care for your son. But due to your situation and his previous reports, I am concerned that you are not able to manage Kayden's needs at this time. What does that mean? Well, Mrs. Peterson's sole supervision during the day of Kayden puts both her and him at risk. And after today's incident, I have concerns. I think that a supervised care facility would be a better fit for Kayden's current needs and your home situation. I'll give you some information, and then you can look it over and conduct your own research. I'll touch base with you both once you've had some time to discuss this. But if she'd like, I would like to speak to your daughter. He's a good boy. We're here to help you find a safe solution for Kayden. No, we make it work. Autism isn't easy, but we, we make it work. I understand. No, no. I don't think that you do. If you understood, you would never suggest what you're suggesting. He... he is my baby. We, we make it work. We make it work. He is my baby. He is my baby. You can't take him out of our home. You can't take him away from us. He's my baby. He's my baby. He's my baby. My daughter, her name was Jackie. She was seven when she passed. She had cerebral palsy. So, I want you to know, tish, that I do understand what you're going through. That's why I got into this work. I'm sorry. Please give this some thought. I think that's all I need from you, Abbie. Thank you. What's going to happen to my brother? We'll help assess the care that your brother needs, I've given your parents some suggestions and we're here to help. We're the best care for him. I don't know what my parents have told you, but I'm coming home to take care of Kayden. He'll be staying with us. I appreciate your concerns Abbie, but right now we're trying to find a solution. We need solutions for a lot of things. Programs for Kayden, employment opportunities. We need for people to not give up on him. He's just a smart, talented kid, and he deserves opportunities just like anyone else does. No one is ever going to be there for him more than me. You okay? No. You? No. Peterson family? You can see Kayden now. He's waking up. It shouldn't be much longer. I'll check in with the doctor. Let me go and grab his discharge instructions to go over with you, okay? Thank you. You okay, dad? I failed him. Dad, don't say that. I was right there. I was right behind the damn thing. How you doing, buddy? Sore? Come here. Shh. Shh. It's gonna get better, okay? I promise. Shh. Shhh. It's okay. It's okay. Shh. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. I promise it's going to be okay. Shh. I love you. What are you doing? A little research. On? Additional care that we can get for Kayden. Can we afford that? We'll see. I never should've left. None of this would've happened if I just... Abbie, don't. It was selfish to leave. Don't put what is happening to Kayden on yourself. How can I not? Because teaching him to adapt to the world was always going to happen. It's not your fault that the world can't adapt to him. But if, if I come home we can go back to our routine. Mom can go to work, I can go to the art store, and then maybe... And then what, that's your solution for the next year? Then what? Do you really think you're helping Kayden by going back to work at that, that art store for the next 10 years? You worked hard. You got into a good school. So, stick with it and have a good career. That is how you will help your brother. I don't want to hear anything about you giving up and coming home. Your mother and I did not raise you and your brother to give up when things got tough. Okay. Okay then. We'll just... We'll take it one day at a time. Wow, you've taken over breakfast duty since I've been gone? That's concerning. Why aren't you at work? Well, I took the day off. For the next little while actually. The social worker said her main concern was for your mom's safety to care for Kayden. So, until we come up with a more long-term solution I will be staying here with Kayden and your mom will be going back to her work for a while. I could get a part-time job down in la. There's a coffee shop in my building. Help out. Pay for books and stuff. Well, cheers to that. These clients have been looking to switch designers for weeks. They keep asking me for referrals. I can't wait to tell them you're back at it. Thank you. Mary, I really appreciate you helping me out so last minute. Hey you good, bud? Good. Hello? Hi. You know who this is? Yeah. Okay good. I... I just wanted to make sure you didn't forget about me already. Or delete my number. Or confuse me for your other girlfriend. No. My other girlfriend's calling later. I wanted to say I'm really sorry. I shouldn't have gotten upset with you and I shouldn't have made it about me. I didn't mean to push you away. I'm a bit of a shithead, huh? I'm not sure what else I can do, but I hope that one day you can forgive me. I think I can do that. Really? Yeah. I'm glad you called actually. I've been thinking about you a lot lately. I'm sorry I led you to believe that I was going to tell them when I wasn't ready yet. Anyways, we're about to go grocery shopping for Christmas dinner. Can we talk later? Are you at your mom's now? Uh, no problem. Yeah. I... I am. So, you'll be back in January? Yeah. I have to look for a job and stuff, but I'll be around. So... does that mean I'll see you soon? Yeah, you, you will. Okay, good. See you later, shithead. We're going to have to work on some new nicknames when you get back. Oh, I don't know, it's got a bit of a ring to it. I'll talk to you soon. Good shower? Good! I was just on the phone with this girl... Karly. I like her a lot. I think she'd like you too. She'd love to see your drawings. Thanks for listening. Okay. Merry Christmas, Kayden. You can go first. Abbie, do you want to help your brother? Want me to help you Kayden? Wow, eeyore. Can Kayden and I share this? Of course. Merry Christmas, Kayden. Merry Christmas, Kayden. Merry Christmas, Abbie.
