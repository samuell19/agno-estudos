[MUSIC PLAYING] [SPEAKING GERMAN] [PHONE RINGING] Louis, that isn't very nice. Well, it's expensive. What can I tell you? We don't have 10,000 tons of vitamin C just lying around. I know, but I had to call our people in Scotland, in Germany. [PHONE RINGING] Look, if you want it by the first, we have to increase capacity, over time. And that's expensive. Yes, sure, you try somebody else. But Louis, before you do it, you better check your contract with us, would you? Sure, I'll hold. He's checking. Who? Louis Garredo in Buenos Aires. Ah. Want to go for a drink after this? Oh, I can't. It's Maddie's birthday. Flown in from London this morning. Huh? Birthday cake. Yes, Louis. fine. Fine. Yes, I'll see to it right away. By the first. Yes, OK. Yeah. Oh, Louis, Dieter sends his love to you. Dieter Weigel. Yes, I will. OK, Louis. Bye, bye. Adios. Louis sends his love to you. You know, I just made the company-- [CLICKING] $68,181. And I made-- [CLICKING] $43.25. And a pat on the back. And a pat on the back. [MUSIC PLAYING] MADELEINE DYER: [SPEAKING FRENCH] Hello, daddy. Hello, daddy. FEMALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING FRENCH] [SPEAKING FRENCH] [SPEAKING FRENCH] What do you want, darling? [FRENCH] What's going on? (SINGING) Happy birthday to you. MADELEINE DYER: Wow! (SINGING) Happy birthday to you. MADELEINE DYER: Super. (SINGING) Happy birthday, dear Maddie, happy birthday to you! Thank you. Oh, Steven. [FRENCH] Bonsoir, mama. Bonsoir, Steven. STEVEN DYER: What have you got to tell mommy? You've got to blow out all the candles, mommy. 26! 26! 26! What a cake. Fornum & Masons, Piccadilly. Right. One, two-- [PHONE RINGING] Damn. [PHONE RINGING] Go on, blow them out. One, two-- [PHONE RINGING] PIERRE: How do you like the cake, mommy? Hello, Dyer. Yes. Yes, Steven Dyer. SON: Can I have the first piece, mommy? MADELEINE DYER: No. The first slice is for grandma. GRANDMA: [SPEAKING FRENCH] Uh-- yes, I did. Um-- can you hold on just for one moment, please? MADELEINE DYER: You're not supposed to tell anybody. I'll take it in the bedroom. OK. Oh, this is marzipan. Mm. [SPEAKING FRENCH] [SPEAKING FRENCH] Well, that's very kind. Uh-- yes. Yes, of course. When were you thinking of? Saturday. Yes, Saturday's fine. But how long would it take? Well, could I be back in Bale the same day? Only my wife and-- oh, I see. Right. Yes. No problem. Right. Goodbye. Have a piece of cake. It's delicious. Thank you. Who was on the phone? Uh-- business. I'll be out of town on Saturday. Probably won't be back 'til late. - Saturday? - Yes. You haven't put it down. What name? Why do you need to put it down? I can remember it. Still, you might forget. What time are you meeting? Where are you meeting? Uh-- look, for God's sake, you're not my bloody secretary anymore. [MUSIC PLAYING] Madeleine. [PLANE TAKING OFF] Just put that sign away. Mr. Dyer? Yes. Now just put that damn sign down. [MUSIC PLAYING] [PHONE RINGING] [SPEAKING FRENCH] Hm. [PHONE RINGING] Entre, s'il vous plait. Oh. Mr. Dyer, welcome to Brussels. I was promised-- guaranteed-- absolute secrecy. I arrive at the airport, there's some idiot standing there and he's holding a sign with my name on it and the initials of the company. Anyone can see it! But how else were we to contact you? I should never have come here, if I'd known. After all, Mr. Dyer, we're only dealing with the company here, not a government, not the KGB. And what the hell are these? Oh, they're for interpreters. We won't need them as I think we all speak English here. Ah, Mr. Dyer. Bronson? [WHISPERING] What? [WHISPERING] Oh, Mr. Dyer, that's unfortunate. I deeply regret-- I was promised complete discretion. And you are going to get it from now on. My word of honor. I'm not sure. I'm not sure at all. Mr. Dyer, please. This was only an accident. We are very well aware of your position. And we respect the great courage you have shown in coming here. We do, sincerely. Well-- I'm Christian Junger, Head of the Competitions Department. We spoke on the phone. Oh, yes, of course. Hello. Hello. My assistants-- Mr. Detur, Mr. Henze. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Hello. Hello. Now let's start afresh, huh? Bronson, Otto, Mr. Dyer. Would you like some coffee, Mr. Dyer? Yes. Yes, I would. Thank you. [SPEAKING FRENCH]. Yes. Mr. Dyer. Thank you. You have brought some papers to show us, Mr. Dyer? No. I wasn't asked to. You said they were available to you. I can get hold of them. It's all except last year's contract. They won't be filed until September. And I should have left Schumann's by then. - Left Schumann's? - Yes. I'm going into business for myself. Is it absolutely necessary for you to leave Schumann's before September? Not absolutely. Well, for us, it's important to have the record as up to date as possible. Yes, I do see that. Only I wanted to take a holiday, you see, before I-- Oh, oh, gentlemen, I think we are getting ahead of ourselves. These are all matters we can discuss as they come up. Shall we? Purely for my own reference. Mr. Dyer, I promise you this tape will not leave my office. Nothing that is said here will go beyond the four of us, not even that we are meeting. All right. Except you have a wife, I think. I suppose she knows. I-- no. She gets too upset. And I have-- I have to be careful what I tell Madeleine. So just us four. Mr. Dyer, you work at the head office of Schumann-Fougere the pharmaceutical group in Bale, Switzerland? STEVEN DYER: Yes. CHRISTIAN JUNGER: What is your present position? STEVEN DYER: My title is World Manager with both vitamins and chemical products. CHRISTIAN JUNGER: So you have a complete overview of Schumann's international activities? STEVEN DYER: Well, I know most about my own particular territory. But, oh, yes. I have a pretty good idea of what they're up to all over the world. Sir? Sir, would you like something to drink. Yes, I would. I deserve one. [BIRDS CHIRPING] [MACHINES WORKING] [LIQUID PUMPING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, Steven! [LAUGHING] She was champion of downhill at [INAUDIBLE]. STEVEN DYER: My. DIETER WEIGEL: Think you can catch her? STEVEN DYER: You bet. DIETER WEIGEL: Oh, we'll see. STEVEN DYER: After you. DIETER WEIGEL: OK! [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh. Oh, shit. Movie it about. It's all right. It's nothing. This never happened to me before. Never. Remarkable. It's happened to me dozens of times. There. Thank you. The bloody piece is so chopped up, I didn't have a child. It was an act of God, Steven. No question. Steven? There's a rumor you're thinking of leaving the company. Oh, well, everybody knows everybody's business. You should know that by now. It's not true, of course. I hope it isn't, for your sake. How much is your salary now? Not bad, is it? And good pension, too. Regular increases on both, a fantastic health program, free education for the kids-- the best-- and so many little treats. Look around you, Steven. You think we could afford a place like this, if we didn't work for the company? La Deutsche Vita, courtesy of Schumann-Fougere. Well, I'm not so grateful. You give Schumann's your life, you can afford to use a ski lodge at weekends. I don't think that's fair exchange. You're really getting out? You'd be the first I'd heard of, voluntarily. Oh, I'm just tired of working for other people, Dieter. I want to be my own-- Your own what? There's this opportunity in Italy. A pig farm. Oh, come on. It's not so damn funny. I've gone into it, Dieter. It's totally viable. I could be clearing half a billion lira in three or four years. How the hell are you going to pay for it? A commercial farm! Jesus, that costs money. STEVEN DYER: It's taken care of. Don't worry. But you're not a pig farmer, Steven. You're a damn good international salesman. That must be why they've kept me sitting on my ass in Bale for three bloody years. - But they value you. You know that. They-- Then why didn't I get the Mexico job? That was just bad luck. And they offered you Nicaragua. Nicaragua. DIETER FIGO: Or Manila. STEVEN DYER: Look, Dieter, I'm not a bloody Swiss, I'm not a bloody German, I'm not in the magic circle, so I've gone as far as I can go at Schumann's. What does Maddie think about it? Italy, farming. Oh, I haven't told her yet. But I intend to. Soon. Steven! I'm going to tell her. Of course, I am. Dieter, she loves Italy. She's going to be delighted. [MUSIC PLAYING] Maddie! Maddie! Maddie! [DOOR SLAMMING] Maddie, don't be silly. Daddy? It's OK, it's OK. Go on. Go and play. Go and watch television. Go on. Come on. Go and watch television. [CRYING] Maddie, come on. For Christ's sake! It's all right. Mommy's not feeling very well. Come on, let's play. Come on. What should we play? (IN UNISON) Chinese checkers. Chinese checkers? It's a board game. Come on, then. Give us it. Come on. I'll be yellow. - All right. All right? I'll be blue. I'll be red. There is no red. [GLASS BREAKING] Maddie? Why didn't you tell me? But I am telling you. We won't have to leave for months. You have no right! No right! I'm sorry. I am sorry. Italy. But you like Italy. You always say-- And the children? Oh, they'll be fine. There are schools there. There are good schools there. Trust me, Maddie. Please, huh? They'll be fine. What have you-- Nothing. The glass broke. I was drinking some water. Oh, it's not so bad as it looks. There. How could you do this? We said we didn't want to stay in Bale forever, didn't we? But-- But we did talk about that. But you're doing so well at Schumann's. And I was proud of you working there. Proud? Schumann's? If only you knew. You've got to stop being just a good, little Swiss girl, Maddie. The world's much bigger than Schumann's, or Bale, or Switzerland. Look, I'm sorry, but we-- we have a chance to live for ourselves and make real money-- a fortune. But pigs? My god. Look, as soon as you see the farm, you'll understand. It'll be fantastic. I'm going to buy everything new-- new house, new buildings, tractors, everything. How can we afford that? Oh, it's taken care of. Please, don't worry. And what do I tell mamma? Huh. Uh-- tell her, her daughter is going to be a millionairess and her grandchildren are going to inherit a fortune. She'll love that. You know, I thought it would be such a nice surprise for you. I really did. I don't like surprises. Let's have a look. There's just a scratch. I would have told you sooner, but there were so many details, and meetings, and-- well, I-- I just thought I shouldn't tell you 'til it was certain. And buying land-- you've got no idea. That's why all those phone calls and going away? Yes. Yes, that's it. And that's all it was. Never do this again to me, please. Never. I won't. I promise you. A pigs farmer's wife, huh? [MUSIC PLAYING] [SPEAKING GERMAN] [SPEAKING GERMAN] [MUSIC PLAYING] Hello, Steven! [PAPERS FALLING] Oh! Don't you have a girl to do this? Oh. Well, she's gone home. [SPEAKING GERMAN] [SPEAKING GERMAN] Don't work too hard. Auf Wiedersehen, Steven. Auf Wiedersehen. Yes, yes. Yes, all of them. No, no problem. Uh-- well, I don't know. Can't you come to Switzerland? Steven? Uh-- well, I see. I'm taking my wife to the farm next weekend. We'll be parked by the land. Perhaps-- wait, what did you say? Yes. Thank you. Yes, I'll do that. Yes, that's fine. OK. Yes. Bye, bye. Was that about the farm? Yes. Yes, it was. Then why do have to act like that? I know about it now. It's not a secret. I know. It's a stupid habit. Forgive me? I'm sorry. What did they want? On the phone. Oh, the man who's selling the farm, he wants to talk to me. I have to sign a couple of papers. Would you mind if we stopped in Milan for an hour or so next weekend? - No. - You can do some shopping. You would like that, wouldn't you? How much can I spend? [LAUGHING] Oh, Steven. What? I don't know. It's silly. It doesn't matter. Just hold me. [MUSIC PLAYING] Well, I don't know. But you can see what's going on? What I can see, what you can see doesn't matter, Mr. Dyer. All that matters is, do these documents you've brought us have a clear and unambiguous proof of a general conspiracy among vitamin manufacturers? I don't think they do. Nor do I. Another thing, Mr. Dyer, all these companies-- well, it involves half a dozen separate countries. But you have jurisdiction in all of them. We have to live with all of them, too. You're afraid to take them on? Not at all, but there are practicalities. Limitations. The department has never before proceeded against a multi-national industry. We can't undertake our first case without a very strong probability of success. Don't you see that? Then what's the point of me being here? And where the hell is Junger? - Wait, Mr. Dyer. Please. Order some coffee, Giuseppe. Now Mr. Dyer, why don't we try and approach the problem from another direction? Why don't we focus our attentions? On what? Well, for the time being, on just your company, for instance, on Schumann's, about which we know so much more than the others, thanks to you. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SPEAKING ITALIAN] [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Contracts that bind customers to Schumann's and make it hard for them to buy vitamins elsewhere. Illegal. Contracts, specifically designed by Schumann's to prevent competition from other manufacturers. Illegal. You're sure of that? Abuse of a dominant position. Outlawed by Article 86 of the Treaty of Rome. To which the Swiss are not signatories. And Schumann is a Swiss company. The Swiss signed a trade pact with the community. Article 23-- the following are incompatible with the proper functioning of the agreement: Clause II, abuse by one or more of the undertakings of a dominant position in the territories of the contracting parties. We can establish determinate position. For instance, vitamin C-- more than 60%. Vitamin H-- 93%. Or we can show how Schumann's contracts abuse that position. We have a case. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Yes. Yes, I think we do. You see, Mr. Dyer, we-- we all want this to succeed very much, but I have to play the devil's advocate, too. Schumann will bring the best against us, of course. We can't afford to be caught unprepared. We need more documentation-- letters, memos, contracts. We'll get them direct from Schumann. With what we've got now, we can probably get authorization to go to the company's offices in our countries and demand anything else we want. What is it, Mr. Dyer? Well, you won't go to their offices before I leave, will you? My poor friend, what do you take us for? [MUSIC PLAYING] Another one? Uh-- no, I better not. My wife will be waiting for me. Oh, pity. You see, I was hoping to ask you-- informally. Off the record, as it were. Yes? Well, what exactly was the reason that first brought you to us? I don't mean the immediate reason. We know that, but the deeper motives? It interests me. It interests all of us. Well, for instance someone-- not me, of course, but shall we call him an unfriendly observer-- he might suspect that it was because of some disappointment you had with your career or with your company. No. No, that's quite untrue. My career at Schumann's has been very successful. I have no feelings of disappointment. As you say. Then what was the motive? Well, you see, Mr. Dutourd-- Oh, please. Francois. Thank you. Steven. You see, Francois, there have been two great influences in my life. Two great influences? Yes. One was the years I spent working for Schumann's in the third world, just to see how the high cost of drugs hurt those poor people. That was an influence, certainly. And, uh-- what was the other one? Cricket. Cricket? Yes. Oh, you-- you mean the game, cricket? Yes. I'm not joking. The straight bat, the cry of, well played, sir, from an opponent, walking away from your crease without waiting for the umpire to dismiss you. Look, Francois, to understand us English, you must first understand cricket. You know, I've always enjoyed teaching foreigners the rules of cricket. May I show you? Well-- Look, let's pretend these glasses are the wickets, all right? Here's one wicket, here's the other. Now we need a bowler. [TAPPING] The bowler, all right? Now-- now remember, there are six balls to every over. I-- STEVEN DYER: Now the bowler-- I think you said your wife is waiting for you. So she is. Another time. I shall look forward to it, eagerly. So Steven, was it sense of fair play that led you to us? When I was 40 years old, what had I ever done but represent Schumann's and its dirty deals, it was time to make a stand. Play my straight bat. Well-- Well, thank you, again, Steven. I wish there were many more like you. Even a couple. If we need any more help-- Well, you've got my number. And in Italy? - Yes. Good. We got everything out of him we could? I think so. [MUSIC PLAYING] - Hello. - Hello. All right? - Yeah. - Buy anything nice? - Yes. And expensive, too. Was that the man from the farm? Yes. I would have liked to have met him. Well, he's not a very interesting man. [MUSIC PLAYING] [CLEARING THROAT] So here's to the death of a salesman, the birth of a pig farmer. Thank you, Dieter. I know a good joke about a pig farmer. Yeah, please. Steven, we're going to miss you. Oh, come on now. Look, we're not going to Australia, just a few hours down the road. It's all right for you, Steven, but poor Madeleine, stuck out in the fields. What's she going to do with herself? Poor Madeleine wants to do this just as much as I do. Yes, of course, I do. [LAUGHING] Herr Direktor this is a great honor. Well, Steven, to the one that got away. Herr Direktor, my wife. [CRYING] I'm sorry. No. My dear girl. She's a sensible girl. She knows there's no life after Schumann-Fougere. Our family, our company, [GERMAN]. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey! [SPEAKING GERMAN] Can I take a copy of this? Yeah. Here. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] Home in an hour or so. It's not our home anymore. There you go. How are you? (SINGING) Deck the walls with boughs of holly, fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la. 'Tis the season to be jolly, fa-la-la-la-la-- Passport. [CRYING] Oh, darling. Come on, Pierre, be a big boy. Here. What the hell is he playing at? Oh, Maddie, you shouldn't have to bribe him. Well, he's been so good. And it's almost Christmas Eve. I know. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] [SPEAKING ITALIAN] What's it about? [SPEAKING ITALIAN] What? [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Hi, [ITALIAN]. You shouldn't have talked to him like that, you'll make him angry. Well, he's just a peasant in uniform. You know, as soon as your back here, you become 100% Swiss again. Yes, sir. No, sir. You know, Maddie, it would have done you good to have lived in England for a bit. And there, we have a healthy disrespect for authority. A healthy disrespect. Get out. What? Get out, per favore. Good morning, senor Dyer. Yes. Good morning. What is going on? You must stay here for a while. What for? There are some men who want to talk to you. About what? And which men? They are not here yet. Well, how long have I got to wait? They are coming from Lugano. What about my family? The children are tired. They are free to go. There. - Look, you know me-- - Certainly. And I come through here all the time. Certainly. Can't we settle this now? I'll come back whenever you want. No. You must stay here. I don't know. Some mix up. Probably it's the number plates. I was supposed to change them to Italian, but I don't know. All right. Take the children to mamma's. No. Yes. Just go to mamma's, wait there, I'll phone as soon as I've finished here, and you can come and pick me up. Mon dieu. [GROANING] [CAR STARTING] Getting cold? There's some hot coffee inside. This way. Inside, please. Steven Dyer? Yes. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Look, what is going on? [ITALIAN] I want to telephone my wife. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] [MUSIC PLAYING] [SPEAKING ITALIAN] You may speak English. Well, what the hell is going on? I am a British citizen. You have no right and I demand to speak to a lawyer. - Please, sit down. - No. What is this about? Sit down, please. You can't arrest me without telling me why. But you have not been arrested, you're only being held for interrogation. Please. I'm Commissioner Moser of the Federal Police, political branch. This is Commissioner Ehrll. What is this? You are Steven Dyer? Yes. Of course, I am. I must telephone my wife. She doesn't know where I am. She'd be very worried and she gets upset. Please, answer only my question. No! But I must make calls to my wife and a lawyer. I must. Mr. Dyer, it's Christmas Eve. You have a family, we have families. If we can get through this quickly, we can all go home for Christmas perhaps. All right? Please. How long were you an employee of the firm Schumann-Fougere? Did you understand the question? Yes. Please, answer it. STEVEN DYER: About 10 years. 10 years? STEVEN DYER: Yes. You worked in the international contracts department? Towards the end. I have a niece who worked in that department. Perhaps it was before your time. Her name is Gabby Heller. I don't remember her. Of course, it's a large department. STEVEN DYER: Yes. And her job was quite a minor one. At what point during your time at Schumann's did you first decide to commit espionage against your employer? Yes? I don't understand. What don't you understand, Mr. Dyer? Did you or did you not pass secret documents belonging to the firm of Schumann-Fougere to an individual not employed by that firm and not resident in Switzerland, specifically to a man named Francois Dutourd, a French national, currently a resident in Belgian? Be very careful how you answer, Mr. Dyer. This is fantastic. You've got it completely wrong. All right. I'll explain and you'll see, you've got it very wrong. Francois Dutourd works in the Competitions Department of the European Commission in Brussels. And his boss is or was-- I don't know-- a man called Junger. Dr. Christian Junger, a West German national, also resident in Belgium. Yes, that's right. Now the Competitions Department investigates unfair trading practices by companies based in any of the Common Market countries. I don't know if you're aware, Schumann's is currently being investigated by the Competitions Department. I mean, I expect it's been in the newspapers here. But the Common Market accused Schumann's of exploiting their dominate position in the supply of vitamins. And they base their case on documents in their possession which shows that Schumann's has been doing this. Now I am the person who supplied Brussels with those documents and copies of contracts Schumann's signed with their customers. I gave them all to Francois Dutourd. So, you see, you are really barking up the wrong tree. In fact, we are all on the same side of the fence, bringing villains to justice. Well, I'm happy to have cleared this up. And I shan't be making any complaints. It's been very inconvenient for me, this. Sit down. All this is of no interest to me. Please. Do you admit that you passed documents belonging to Schumann-Fougere to an individual-- Yeah, but I explained. Yes or no? Yes, for reasons that-- Yes. What was the nature of these documents? I've told you. They were contracts with illegal clauses, offering rebates-- They were business contracts that you understood Schumann's would want and expect to remain secret. Well, since they were illegal, obviously-- You understood they were secret, yes or no? Yes. COMMISSIONER MOSER: And you took them and gave them to a third party? Yes. So this is espionage. No. You can't say that. It isn't true. COMMISSIONER EHRILL: What isn't true? Well, I-- I'm not a spy. I'm on the side of the law. [MUSIC PLAYING] Mr. Dyer, when you stole the documents from Schumann-- I didn't steal. I exposed them. How much were you paid for this service? Nothing. You were offered employment with the European Commission? No. Then what was your motive for doing it? I've told you-- I felt it was right. It was the right thing to do. Is it not true that your main motive was really to embarrass your employer? No. You were a troublemaker, Mr. Dyer, weren't you? And for this reason, you weren't promoted as fast as you would like, so you thought you would get your own back on the company. That's how it was, wasn't it? Not true. Do you deny making statements attacking the company, complaining of its treatment of you? Statements to who? To Dieter Weigel. You know Dieter Wiegel? You spoke to him of your resentments against the company. You were angered that they didn't make you their chief agent in Mexico. But Dieter is my friend. Oh, he's a true employee of Schumann-Fougere and a law citizen of Switzerland, so I think we must believe him when he reports that you spoke of your hatred for the company. And this was why you decided to become a spy, Mr. Dyer, wasn't it? Not true. Not true. Then what possible reasons could you have? They are criminals. I exposed them. Schumann has been convicted of no crimes under the laws of Switzerland. But I'm not a spy. One moment, please. [GERMAN] [SPEAKING GERMAN] COMMISSIONER MOSER: We will continue this tomorrow. I can go home? COMMISSIONER MOSER: No, you will stay here. I want to use the telephone. COMMISSIONER MOSER: You may make one phone call. No doubt your wife will want to hear from you. Yes. And a lawyer. I went to call a lawyer. And I have a right. I'm a British citizen. And British law says I can speak to a lawyer. But you're not a British citizen, you are Maltese. I was British for over 30 years, then Malta got independence and they gave me that. But when I worked in Venezuela, I was an honorary British consul. In any case, Maltese law is still British. Who cares? We are not in Britain now or in Malta. We are in Switzerland. COMMISSIONER MOSER: And here, we have our own local customs. You have not been charged yet, therefore, there's no need for a lawyer. One phone call, Mr. Dyer, to your wife. [MUSIC PLAYING] Understand, Mr. Dyer, if you say anything to her about Schumann's, the Common Market, anything, the interview will be terminated. Is that clear? She wouldn't understand anyway. Haven't you told her about this? No. [SPEAKING FRENCH] Happy Christmas, Maddie. What's happening? What? I don't know. Maddie, I can't tell you. Please, don't ask. I brought you some clothes, and a toothbrush, and a razor. How do I look? Awful? I'm sorry. How are the children? Oh. What have you told them? I just said daddy's away on busy. Maddie, please, don't. Please? Please? [CRYING] When will you be coming home? Soon. Soon. Really soon. I don't understand this. What have you done? You're sure I've done something? You know that? If you haven't, why are you here? Maddie, I think you'd better go. MADELEINE DYER: What should I tell people? Mamma? I don't know. [CRYING] My brother said we should find you a lawyer. Should I? Yes. Yes, do, please. I'll do anything, only I don't understand. Maddie, I've done nothing wrong. I promise you. [CRYING] [KNOCKING] We're finished. My wife should go now. Madame Dyer? [SPEAKING FRENCH] [MUSIC PLAYING] Mamma? Mamma? [GLASS CRASHING] [BANGING] Bonjour, Madame Dyer. Bonjour. S'il vous plait. Bonjour, Madame. Bonjour. S'il vous plait. [SPEAKING FRENCH] [MUSIC PLAYING] [CAR CRASHING] [SPEAKING ITALIAN] STEVEN DYER: The Italian government, they want to develop their farming, so they offer grants. You can check this easily. There's no mystery. COMMISSIONER MOSER: And were their any other grants, Mr. Dyer? STEVEN DYER: I don't understand. COMMISSIONER MOSER: Grants from Brussels, for instance, for services rendered? No. That's slander. [MUSIC PLAYING] Madeleine? No. Mr. Dyer, I truly regret-- There was an accident? No. Well, of course there was. There must have been. I wish I could say it was an accident. Well, there's no other way it could have happened. You don't know Madeleine. But how could it have been an accident? It's an accident. A terrible accident. Mr. Dyer, she-- she hanged herself. I'm so sorry, Mr. Dyer. Well, how could she have killed-- [CRYING] She killed herself! Dear God, no! No, no, no! No! No! [CHURCH BELLS RINGING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [CRYING] MADELEINE DYER (VOICEOVER): Please, forgive me for what I'm going to do. They told me I will not see Steven again for 20 years. And I do not wish to live without him. And I don't understand. [MUSIC PLAYING] Where are we going? Basle. [LAUGHING] You, uh, want to play a hand, Steven? Not so good today? You want to talk? What are you thinking about? I'm thinking about my children. As you don't know them, it wouldn't interest you. I don't believe it. I sit here, day after day, they won't let me see a lawyer, nothing. That's the fucking country. I've been here six weeks. Haven't seen a lawyer yet. Six weeks. For what? One lousy joint. If only I could get to a phone. There are people in Brussels-- important people. If they knew I was here, I would be out in no time. If I could just phone them or write to them. Let somebody else do it. Well, there's guys leaving here every day. Give them these peoples' number. They'll get in touch for you. It's worth a shot. PRISONER 1: Why are you friendly to that man? PRISONER 2: Because he's in trouble. He just lost his wife, for Christ's sake. PRISONER 1: I hear he's a spy. PRISONER 2: What? PRISONER 1: An enemy of Switzerland. A guard told me this. PRISONER 2: He's a goddamn hero. He turned in this crooked company. What do you mean, spy? [MUSIC PLAYING] I am Dr. Bauer. I'm a lawyer. Your wife talked to me about defending you, before she-- [GASPING] Where the hell have you been? I've been sitting in here for-- For too long. Please, sit down. You see, we couldn't get to see you until Brussels put pressure on them. I knew it. Once Brussels heard, I knew things would happen. I am getting out now? It's not so simple. STEVEN DYER: What? There's the question of bail. The Swiss have set it at 1 million francs. And, well, Brussels thinks that's too much. Too much? But I'm here because of Brussels! I'm sure the Swiss will come down. They're reasonable. You won't be here much longer. Are they treating you well here? They fill me up with pills to keep me quiet. They wouldn't even let me bury her. Yes. Yes, that was bad. That was wrong. I'm sorry. What do you say we go outside, Mr. Dyer? Some fresh air? What we'll argue is that by signing the agreement with the Common Market, Switzerland has accepted other standards and [INAUDIBLE] those only imposed by national law. Will it work? I don't know. To assert that there is a European code that has precedence over national courts of law-- that's still a fairly new concept. Hard to swallow. Not just in Switzerland. I shouldn't be facing a trial. I shouldn't be here at all. You know, Mr. Dyer, as a Swiss lawyer, I'm well aware of the imperfections of our system, but it is not an entirely discreditable one. There will be at trial. And it will be conducted fairly, as we see it here. The lawyers will make the decisions honestly, no doubt. But you must understand that those who have arrested you, those who are holding you, and those who will judge you will all see what you've done as a very wicked thing. To do something that seems to harm the interests of a firm like Schumann-Fougere, which has brought so much wealth to this country-- well, it will seem, to most Swiss, like an attempt to push us back to where we were once-- poor, neglected, a bit comical. A land of mountains and cuckoo clocks. [LOCK CLANKING] [SPEAKING GERMAN] PRISONER 3: [SPEAKING GERMAN] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [MUSIC PLAYING] [SPEAKING GERMAN] The bail is paid-- 25,000 francs. Brussels paid? Not exactly. They agreed to pay, but the check hasn't arrived yet. Your wife's family gave me the money, but you're out now. [PHOTOS SNAPPING] Come. We must run the gauntlet. [PHOTOS SNAPPING] [INTERPOSING VOICES] [SPEAKING GERMAN] I don't speak German. Mr. Dyer, Lars Bohner for the Sunday Times-- [SPEAKING FRENCH] There's a little confusion. Are you a British national, Mr. Dyer? Yes, absolutely. Have the British government helped you in any-- What support have you received from the Common Market? No comment. REPORTER 1: About your wife, Mr. Dyer-- REPORTER 2: Did you steal documents from Schumann-Fougere? - No! I didn't steal, I reported. [CAR ENGINE REVVING] Why couldn't I talk to them? Your case still has to be judged. We don't want to offend the Swiss. And then Brussels-- we don't want to offend them either. Offend Brussels. Still, you see there's a lot of interest in your case. And that's good for us. Later on, maybe, we use the press. So how does it feel to be free? How can Brussels not have paid my bail? I phoned with someone in the commendations department. They're very apologetic. It was only administrative difficulties-- paperwork. Paperwork? I was rotting in there. Three months! I've arranged for you to phone Brussels tonight. They're very keen to talk to you. We must do what we can to keep Brussels on our side, Mr. Dyer. There are many expenses you have to face now-- legal expenses. STEVEN DYER: Where are we going? I have taken a room for you, in a small hotel. The journalists won't find you there. I want to see my children. Tomorrow. There are reporters around your mother-in-law's house. I have arranged somewhere for you to join them. Please. Is it all right? Ah. Not bad. Your phone call will be at 7:00. The number is-- I know the number. Oh. Well, then I'll call for you tomorrow morning. 9:00? Well-- See you tomorrow then. Yes. [PHONE DIALING] STEVEN DYER (ON PHONE): Extension 425, s'il vous plait. Dr. Junger? Christian? It's me, Steven. Steven Dyer. Steven, my dear fellow. No, it's not Dr. Junger. No, not Dutourd. Poor Francois, he has the mumps. The mumps, yes. It's Sencini. Giuseppe. Do you remember me? That's right. Now Steven have you been released? When we heard what had happened, we were shocked, absolutely. Bye, Giuseppe. Terrible, terrible. Steven, would you hold on a moment, please? Dyer. Steven, it's Christian. Yes. Yes. I was away, now I'm back. You know how it is-- Strasbourg, Brussels, Washington. Now has Giuseppe told you the bad news about poor Francois? His face all puff! But Steven, there's some very good news, too. You'll be delighted. It hasn't been announced yet, but I have information that Schumann's will certainly be convicted and fined heavily. Our department will have had its first success. Isn't that splendid? Yes, that's very good news. That's really-- Christian, what should I do now? What? Oh, what you should do? Well, Steven, first, I think you should get out of Switzerland. I gather things may not go so well for you, if there's a trial. Don't worry about the bail money. We are prepared to forget about that. I know I didn't. Steven, it was because of-- you know how it is. We are all slaves to bureaucracy around here. Everything takes an age. But I intend to reimburse your wife's family, certainly. Oh, don't you have a farm somewhere? Italy? But I can't go back there alone. My wife and I, we-- we were very happy there. And to go back without her-- no, I don't want to go back to prison. Christian, I don't think you understand. I am in trouble. Money. No, it's not just the legal expenses. Well, the farm. I should have been there, seeing the work was being done. The Italians may take away my grant. If they do that, I shall lose all my capital. But I did it for you, Christian, for your department. Everything I did and my wife. You have a responsibility! We are prepared to consider reasonable expenses, of course. But if you haven't made unwise speculations, I don't see how-- you can hardly blame us, if your wife was so unstable as to-- Steven, things have gone very badly for you. I'm sorry. But I thought you understood there were risks. Of course, there are risks for us, too. If any of us would have gone to Switzerland while we were investigating Schumann's, we might have got into a lot of trouble. But you never did, did you? None of you. You would never meet me in Switzerland. Oh my god. Steven, you've just being released from prison. You are probably tired, upset. You're not in a condition to sensibly discuss-- it's not a question of letting you down. But there are things to discuss-- options, possibilities. It all takes time. We cannot settle everything in one phone call. Steven, we acknowledge we have a responsibility, but please, give us a little time. Yes. Of course. Yes. I have your lawyers number. Of course, I will. Goodbye, Steven. Schizer! [MUSIC PLAYING] It was probably good advice he was giving you. I have an idea the Swiss will be happy to see you go. They gave me your passport. That's unusual. I think you are an embarrassment to them. I'm an embarrassment everywhere. You know, when I was in prison, I often wondered how the police knew it was me they should arrest. How did they get my name? I thought about that, too. I know Schumann's was shown the photocopies you took. Do you remember if you wrote on them at all? Maybe. But Brussels wouldn't have let them see my handwriting. They wouldn't have been that careless. Another possibility-- Schumann's may have got your name in Brussels. There was a rumor. This is what happens. Oh, quite innocently, maybe. A bit of gossip in the politicians ear at the cocktail party-- only the politician happened to be a consultant for Schumann's. But only the competitions department knew about me. I don't think you'll ever know for sure. [MUSIC PLAYING] Your children, Mr. Dyer. [CRYING] [PHOTO SNAPPING] Ladies and gentlemen of the press, thank you for attending here today. I now have the pleasure to introduce to you Mr. Steven Dyer. [PHOTO SNAPPING] Before I answer your questions, I would like to read a short statement, explaining the circumstances that have brought me to London. After I was released from prison and returned to Italy, I found that the loans and grants for my farm had to be renegotiated. The attitude of officials was no longer friendly. As you know, Schumann-Fougere has enormous investments in Italy. A year later, the European Commission found Schumann's guilty of improper trading practices. The company was fined 240,000 pounds-- a fraction of 1% of its annual turnover. This fine was later reduced. At the same time, the Bale Criminal Court found me guilty of economic espionage. [PHOTO SNAPPING] After a long campaign by my lawyers, the European Parliament voted unanimously that I should be compensated for the suffering and losses that my services to the Common Market had brought me. I had, by now, lost hundreds and thousands of pounds trying to save my farm in the teeth of official opposition. I was offered, in compensation, only 20,000 pounds. And to get it, I had to sign an agreement absolving the European Commission from any further responsibility in my case. To pay the most immediate of my debts, I signed. By the beginning of this year, I was destitute and facing further imprisonment for debt. I resolved to leave Italy and come to Britain, which I have always regarded as my true homeland. Hey, what's wrong? Will they let us live in England? Yes, of course. Of course, they will. Don't worry. Daddy knows what he's doing. [ENGINE REVVING] But wherever I am finally permitted to live, I shall continue in my fight against the Swiss government that unjustly convicted me of espionage and against the European Commission, who were only too glad to receive the information I supplied, but then, when disaster fell, like Pontius Pilate, tried to wash their hands of the problem. I shall not rest until they have admitted their responsibility and made full restitution to me and to my children. Thank you. [PHOTOS SNAPPING] [MUSIC PLAYING]
