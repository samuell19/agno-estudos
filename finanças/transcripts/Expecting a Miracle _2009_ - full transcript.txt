And that wraps up orange county. And on the West Side, we have a sigalert on the 405 northbound at Wilshire. Traffic is backed up all the way to the 10. Darling. You awake, honey? Yes. I couldn't really sleep. Well, you're not nervous, are you? No, I'm excited. Today could be our day. Today is our day. I love you. I love you, too. Hey, where you going? I just remembered something. But... I think it's absolutely adorable how much energy you're putting into this room. Most couples don't even begin to think about nurseries until they're three months in or so. I just want everything to be right for our little guy. Or girl. Guy or girl... whatever. I just want he or she to be healthy. Okay. Well, I have to get ready for work. No peeking till after the fertility clinic. You're gonna find out soon enough. Don't spoil the surprise. Okay. All right, I'm late for work. I got to go. 405 is jammed. Take sepulveda. Thanks. 3:00. Don't be late. I will be there. Don't worry. Okay. Okay. All right. That's great. Right there. Thanks, man. I'm sorry. He's not in the office right now. Sure, I'll put you through. Good morning. Hi. Good morning. Here's the latest changes in the Stevenson project. Thanks. Hey, isn't today the big day? Yeah, let's hope third time's the charm? Good luck. Thanks. There are several items on the agenda, Ms. Stanhope. I want to make certain this investment matches my financial goals. I'm especially interested in how the fund has performed over the last 15 years and who conducts your independent analysis of it. I'll take a hard look at the way the portfolio changed and the types of market securities the fund holds. The performance of this fund, in comparison to others of its type, will make the decision for me. Let's take a look at these, and then we'll pick up page 2. Hey. I was starting to get nervous. Punctual Pete... always on time. Yeah, laugh now. You won't be laughing when I'm on diaper duty. Hi. Come on in, you two. Here we go. I'm afraid I have some bad news. Your test came back negative. What do you mean? I'm sorry. But I don't understand. You said if anything could work, this would, like it was a sure thing. Well, nothing's 100% with these procedures. Occasionally, it's not successful. I will have to say, though, I'm a little surprised. We can... we can keep trying, can't we? The more you try, you won't increase your odds. Statistically speaking, after three attempts, your success rate drops off. How much? Considerably. S-So we shouldn't try again? I-I've been doing this a long time. I'm trying to explain the realities of the situation. So, what's the problem? Medical science has its limits. We can't perform miracles. Look, you two can continue to spend money, but at this point, what I'm suggesting is that you need to start considering other options. Well, obviously, you have some decisions to make, so I will leave you two to discuss it. Mr. and Mrs. Donnell, how can I help you today? Hi. We need to open a line of credit. All right. Well! Okay. Well, hello, there. Um, for what reason will you be applying today? Well... this is Sam. Hello, Sam! We just adopted. And we thought it would take a little longer than it did, and we would have time to save up for his arrival, but... Okay, not a problem. Not a prob... Hello, there, handsome. Yes, you are. Thank you. You're welcome. Um... okay. These are the forms that I will need you to fill out initially. And, just give me one second. I will be right back with you. Thank you so much. My pleasure. She loved you. Okay. Pete? Pete? What you doing? I'm just... I'm just packing this stuff away. Well, a couple came in the office today. They just adopted this, beautiful, beautiful baby boy. Yeah? You know, I know we talked about adoption back in the beginning, when we were first having troubles, but I don't know. Today was just... It really seemed like a possibility. Yeah, I... I don't know. It would be a baby. It just wouldn't be the same. You mean, you... you couldn't... You couldn't love a little baby, just 'cause it wasn't ours? It's just different, you know? It would be... It would be different. That's all I'm saying. Well, then, I guess we're just stuck, aren't we? You don't want to do any more fertility treatments and won't consider adoption, so I guess we're just stuck. So, now this is all my fault? No. You come home late from work every night. It's an effort for me to get out of bed every morning. I cry at the drop of a hat for no reason whatsoever. I am tired of seeing you be disappointed. I'm tired of feeling like, in some way, I have failed. I can't do this. Something has got to change here, 'cause I can't do this anymore. Sorry. Didn't mean to rattle you. You working late again? Yeah, it's the Stevenson project. I'm concerned about the reinforcements in the concrete panels. I just want to run the numbers again. So, how's that lovely wife of yours? Good. Good. She's good. Now, Pete, it... it's none of my business, but this is the fourth night this week you've been here. You're practically living here. And not just that... I notice you've been a little hard on your team lately. Late on your deadlines... Distracted. Everything's not fine. It's, um... It's this whole baby thing. Still no luck? No. And now Donna thinks I'm being selfish because I don't want to keep trying, and to be perfectly honest with you We just can't afford it anymore. And now there's a whole adoption issue. I don't know. Maybe she's right. Maybe we are just stuck. Well... Maybe you need a little time off. Go and have some fun together. Take a trip. Rediscover a little romance. Yeah, that'd be great, but, we just can't afford it. I'll tell you what. You know that time-share of mine down in San Marcos? Yeah. Why don't you take it for a week? It's right on the beach. You don't have to fly. You can just drive your brand-new, shiny s.U.V. Down there. Do you a world of good. Well, that's a real generous offer, but, um, I'm not sure that now is the right time. I want you to take that week. I want you to get away from all this noise, phones, traffic. It'll give you a chance to get this sorted out. Come on. We got ourselves a deal? Good. Good. Told you we should have googled this. Are you sure you know where you're going? Yeah, down this dirt road. Thought you had a map. Yeah, I do. Unfortunately, this road isn't on it. Look, that first road we were on turned into this road, and it should have taken us back to the main highway, but unfortunately, it brought us here, I think. That's great. In other words, we're lost, Pete. Just because I don't know where we are doesn't mean we're lost. That is not comforting. Look... Look, I know this wasn't your idea, but here we are, on vacation in Mexico. So, how does that change anything Pete? I-I'm still not pregnant. You won't consider adoption. Nothing has changed... Only the scenery. Pete, watch out! You okay? I think so. Are you? Yeah, it's not me I'm worried about. It's the car. That doesn't sound good. No, it doesn't. Come on. Wh... Okay. I think it's time to call someone. No. No service. Great. That's just great, Pete. That's great. What are we supposed to do now? Well, I think we should find a town. There's got to be some civilization around here somewhere. There's a sign right there that says there's a town ahead, I believe. Okay, a town is good. A town means people, and people mean someone who can help us. So come on. Let's go. No, you... someone should stay with the car. Don't you think? It's a road. After all, someone could come along. You want to stay here by yourself? I will be fine, Pete. Someone's got to stay with the car. All of our stuff is in there. I don't know about this. Go, all right? If someone bad comes along, I'll hop in the car, lock the door, and roll up the windows, okay? Okay, I'll be back soon as I can. Fine. I'll be fine. Pete? That you? Please tell me that's you. Give me my hat! Give me my hat! Give me my hat! Hello. Pepillo, come here. I think so. Let's go, Jose. Hey, kid. Señor, are you here for the fiesta? The what? The fiesta. Where exactly is here? You are in dommatina. Dommatina? Sí. Does dommatina have a mecánica? Un mecánico? Sí. The best in all of méxico. He is my brother. Come. I will show you. Okay. You said you would watch him. Now you're here, and he's gone, and I'm late to meet the priest. Watch and see... not follow him around all dommatina. If you want me to watch him, you're gonna have to find him first. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Where you going? What do you mean? The conchitas aren't going to bake themselves. Look, if you see the boy, please tell him I'm with father Arturo. Well, you can tell him yourself. Can you please not run away like that? It scares your brother. Okay. Hi. Pepillo... Where you been? You know you can't go running off without telling me. Can I help you? Are you the mechanic? Sí. My car is in the ditch at the bottom of the hill. I think I might have bent the drive shaft. Any chance you can tow it up here and take a look at it? Um... i think it's a little too late for that, señor. Too late? What do you mean? See for yourself. Whoa! Hi. They came along right after you left. All it cost me was a, straw hat. Hey, um, how much do I owe you? What? ¿cuánto? No, señor, you owe me nothing. I couldn't leave her stranded on the road. It would not be right. Excuse me. Well, thanks. Thank you. I wanted to talk to Maria. Let's go ask her, then. Yep, you were right, señor. It is a wheel bearing and spindle. That's what I was afraid of. Can you fix it? First, I must take it out and inspect it. Well, when can you do that? Next week. Next week? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Can't you do it a little quicker? I've got, reservations in San Marcos. You don't understand. It's not that. I promised father Arturo I would help him. If I don't help him with the máquina, the children cannot fly. The children can't fly? Sí, for the fiesta. This is why your car must have to wait. Look, I'm late enough already. I'm sorry. Wait. Wait. What if I help this, father Arturo with his máquina... Whatever it is? Can you at least take a look at it? You know about building things? I do work for sunhouse engineering. We've built some of the biggest buildings in Los Angeles. But you're good with ropes and wires? I hang my own Christmas lights. Well, maybe it's okay. You can help father Arturo, and I can help you. Okay, where do I find this father Arturo? Well, he's at the church. Pepillo can take you. Come back in the afternoon. By then, we will know, okay? All right, good. Thanks, man. Okay. Come. We must hurry. Can he fix it? I don't know. He won't even look at it until I find this priest and help him out. Priest? Help him do what? I don't know... something about cables and flying children. Come on! Father Arturo will be waiting for us. Okay, don't go anywhere. This isn't gonna take long. And then we're getting out of here... I swear. Where we going? My name is pepillo. What's your name? Pete. Peep? No, no. Pete. Pete. Like, Peter. Pedro, only short. Pete. Pete. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. You know what, señor Pete? What's that? In five days, I'm going to fly. Really? Hey, shouldn't you be in school? There's no school the week before the fiesta. All we got was presidents' day. Father Arturo. Father Arturo. Good morning, pepillo. How is your leg today? Good. And where is Juan? Juan's working on my car. I had a little car trouble. I'm Pete stanhope. I'll be his replacement today. Very well. Father Arturo, we must get started. The festival's only days away. Okay, but be careful of your leg today, okay? Okay. Bueno. But why flying children? Well, many years ago, in this very Plaza, a stranger arrived, and he was very thirsty from his long journey across the desert. And somehow, the people were afraid of him, and they simply closed their doors and hid. And the only one who showed him any kindness was a small crippled boy. A boy like me. And so, to thank the boy for his kindness, the stranger, who was none other than San Judas tadeo, transformed the boy into a white dove, who flew three times around the Plaza before he came to rest at his feet. So when San Judas tadeo transformed the boy back, the boy could walk. And over the years, this has come to be known as the miracle of dommatina. Every year, in order to honor San Judas tadeo, we select one special boy, and he is given the chance to fly. That special boy is going to be me. Sí. Antonio, how are you, man? Good, Felipe. What's up? It smells like cinnamon. Are you ready? Very well. What do you say? Conchita, conchitas. Conchitas, conchitas. Conchitas, conchitas. Conchitas, conchitas. Conchitas. Hey. Listen, you take this flour here, and then you're gonna blow it... I want to see. I want to see that going down, okay? That's it. Very good. You have to do it harder. Okay, once again, once again. Harder. Okay. Once again, once again. Hit it. Hit it hard. - Conchitas. - Conchitas. Conchitas! There. I'sorry. I don't mean to interrupt. It's just the kids are adorable. Well, we're making conchitas. Do you want to come help us? What are conchitas? It's cookies. Here. I'll show you some. You can try one. Thank you. Thank you so much. My gosh. Cinnamon. That tastes like summer. Yeah. Then you can come help us. Well, I would love to. It's just that our car broke down, and soon as we get it fixed, we're gonna be leaving. Well, if you're here tomorrow, you can come help us then, okay? Okay, thanks. Okay. I'm sure by tomorrow we'll be gone. You know what? Things in dommatina don't necessarily happen the way you plan them, so, I mean, we'll be here, okay? Okay. Bye. Adiós. What did you do? What is this? Aah! We're not gonna have enough for the conchitas. What are we doing? Shake it. Shake it. Shake it. Pepillo! The sun is hot. Rest. First I finish this. This boy. He's excited about flying? Well, it is a great honor to be chosen, even more so for pepillo. He's a special child. His leg... has it... Has it always been like that? Well, no. His mother and father passed away some time ago. He lives now with his brother Juan, but there was a tragedy. There was a fire. Juan managed to get out in time, but, he had to jump out the window and landed very hard and injured his spine. And since then, he has been... How do you call? A physical challenge. Couldn't they have done a surgery or something? The doctors did what they could, but while he's not likely to get better, he will probably not be any worse. Still, there's much to be happy about. He's... He's a happy child. He's well-loved by everyone. There's many people with two good legs who cannot make that claim. Don't just sit there like two lazy old men. It's not going to build by itself. He's right. It's not going to get built by itself. Well, listen, padre, I'd love to stay here and help you, but I should really go check on my car. I'm sure it's done now. Yes, well, our work is done for today, señor stanhope. Gracias. Hey, these are yours. God bless you. Okay. Pepillo, adiós, amigo. Adiós, señor Pete. So, any news? I can straighten the bracket and repair the linkage, but the wheel bearing and spindle... They're broken. Is it fixed? Can we leave? No, the mechanic's got to order some new parts. What? Yeah, it looks like we're stuck here for a day, maybe two. You are kidding me! No. I guess we should start looking for a hotel room,... If this town even has a hotel. Señor Pete, I take you to la Fonda... Very good hotel. Come. I will show you. Pepillo, this is my wife, Donna. Donna, this is pepillo. Hola. Hello. Nice to meet you. See? And you thought there wasn't even a hotel here. Pepillo, are you sure this is a nice hotel? It's not just some old flophouse? It is the best hotel in all of dommatina. You're sure about this? I am sure, because it is the only hotel in dommatina. Come. You're very fortunate. In all dommatina, this is the last room left. And as you can see, it's not very romantic. I fix it for you. Neither are we... Very romantic, I mean. A beautiful place, a beautiful couple... Just in time for the fiesta? No, no, no, no. Don't rearrange the furniture. It's fine. It's not... not necessary. We are only here for one night, anyway, so thank you. As you wish, señorita. You know what? Let me give you a little something extra for your trouble. No, señor. You have paid for the room. It's enough. Thanks. Gracias. You know, that's the third time today. Back home, you can't tip people enough. Down here, you can't tip people at all. Very interesting. Would you stop pacing? I just hate being stuck here, in dommatina, of all places. If I hadn't crashed the car, we'd be in San Marcos by now. Pete, no one is blaming you, all right? Let's just get the part in the morning and get to San Marcos. Ibuenas noches! Did you order room service? I don't think they have room service here. What do you call that? Buenas noches, señor. I think this is a mistake. We didn't order this. No, señor, there's no mistake. It's a... what do you call it... a compliment. Come. Please, enjoy. Señorita. Thank you very much. Gracias. Enjoy. What's so funny? Nothing. What is it? It just reminds me of our first date. Remember? Yeah, I took you to Rosa's cantina. No, but remember the mariachis? How could I forget? They were so loud, we could barely hear ourselves think. I probably gave them 5 bucks to get them to play, and I had to give them 10 bucks to make them stop. And the waiter dumped guacamole on me. Man. After all that, you lost your keys, and you had to walk me all the way back to campus, remember? Yeah. Yeah, I got a little secret to tell you about that. I, um... I didn't really lose my keys that night. You did that on purpose? Why? Well, I wasn't ready for our date to be over. Why didn't you just ask me if you could walk me home? Would you have let me? Are you kidding? 2 miles in those stiletto heels. My feet hurt for days. Well, wasn't I worth a couple of blisters? At the time. Yep, that was a long time ago. I'm not saying we go back. I'm just... I'm just saying we have to decide to let it go, to move on... that's all. Move on to what, Pete? This isn't like some building that... that you just finish and move on to the next. This is about starting a family. You expect me to just say, "okay, that's fine. "I'll do without. We'll be a childless couple for the rest of our lives." I don't know if I can do that, Pete. Can you not see that?! Is there something wrong, señor? No. No. She's... She's just a little homesick... That's all. Okay. Señor, señor... No more music. Gracias. You must hurry. Come. We must get down to the Plaza and help father Arturo. Can't this wait till morning? Señor Pete, it is morning. Didn't you hear the rooster? Is that what that was? We must hurry. Father Arturo is waiting for us. It's not good to keep a priest waiting. He works for god. Right. Right. We certainly wouldn't want to do that. Just, um, give me a minute, will you, buddy? Okay. Where are you going? Apparently, I'm late for work. Well, let me know when the car's ready, so I can be all set to leave. Yeah, I'm sure as soon as the mechanic gets the part, we'll be on our way. Hey, buddy. Señor Pete. Yeah? What to know a secret? Sure. You know señorita Pete? You mean Donna? Yeah, señorita Donna. Yeah, what about her? I think she is very beautiful. Yeah. Yeah. She is very beautiful. Hey, why don't you tell her that next time you see her? Why don't you tell her? Well, women like to hear things like that from other people besides their husband. If señorita Donna was my wife, I would tell her every day how beautiful she is. That way, she will always know how beautiful she is. You know, pepillo, whatever girl ends up with you is gonna be a very lucky lady. As lucky as señorita Donna? I think you're gonna have to ask her about that. All right. Put it here. But be careful. It's very heavy. Private stanhope reporting for duty, sir. I'm so glad you're still here. We have much left to do. Gracias. All right, well, let's get at it. What's first? What's this thing? This is the machine that makes the boy fly. See, we put the cables, wrap around here, and then we attach them to the Poles. And then, over here, we put the seat where the boy sits, and then he flies around the Plaza. What can I do to help? You know, you can rest for a little while, okay? You've been working hard for two days, and your leg's a little sore? Okay. Adiós, señor Pete. Okay. See you, buddy. Okay. What's your... What's your completion date? What? When do you want to be finished? Today. Today? Sí. Don't you want to give yourself a little cushion there, padre? No. You take this paper. Did you fold it? Did you fold it? Sí. Very well. Hit it, hit it. Hit it hard. Hard. Very good. Like that. Hard, hard, hard, hard. Just like that. Good job. Keep like this. What is this shape you have here? Hi. Hi. Hola. I see you're still here. Yeah, well, our car's still being fixed. We got to wait for a part, so we'll probably be here another day. Well, I'm sorry about your car, but not really, 'cause then you can help us bake. Well, I don't know if I remember how to bake. You don't bake at home? Not since I was a little girl. It's time to learn again, you know, 'cause everybody needs to learn how to bake so we can teach our children, right, kids? Are you sure these things will hold? Well, they always have. So, tell me, life in the north... Is it different from life in dommatina? Well, there's certainly less traffic here. In Los Angeles, you need a car for everything. You drive to work. You drive home. If you're hungry, you drive to the market or a restaurant. I swear, I spend more time in my car than I do at my house. Well, your wife... She must be happy you work so hard. She works, too. We both work. Everybody works. Who takes care of the children? We don't have any children. No children. Well, you're still young. What's your name? Donna. Donna, magdelena. Nice to meet you. Kids, say hi to Donna. Hi, Donna. Hi, Donna. Hi, Donna. Very good. Okay. We are going to show this lady how to make buns. How do we make buns? First, you mix it. Very well! Okay, so, we're gonna teach her that, okay? You ready to get your hands dirty? Absolutely. Sure. Okay, good. Keep pounding. Keep pounding. Hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard. I mean, it's not like we haven't been trying. Trying? To have a baby. I mean, at first, we didn't worry about it. You know, sometimes these things take a while. But then when it didn't happen, then we started trying harder and harder, and not the normal way, mind you. That I wouldn't have minded, believe me. But it was frozen this and frozen that and test tubes and microscopes and drugs and not to mention the special herbs and the teas and the... the meditations and the yoga and taking her temperature every hour and then the mad dashes home, just so we could... You know... you know, try to make a baby. Sí. Sí. And the money. You have no idea how much these things cost, between the doctors and the lab work. And of course, none of it's covered by insurance. Suffice it to say, it's been a struggle. Yes, but you still love each other. ¿sí? That's the important thing. Yeah, but if I can't give her what she wants, what's the point? You said it yourself... We're still young. We could both start over. I think that would be the biggest act of selfishness, not love. How so? I would not abandon her to face her burdens alone. I would strive to make her burdens lighter... Her sorrows easier to bear. Love will not fix these things that trouble you, but it will give your union the strength to find its way through the journey of life together. But that's just the opinion of one Mexican priest. Let's check to see if these cookies are ready. Are they finished? Are they ready? Are they ready? I don't think so. I don't think so. That's too hot. That's too hot for you. Not quite ready! Okay, here we go. Hey, Teri, should we check to see the cookies? I know you wanted to come look. You come look, 'cause these were some of your special cookies. Let's see. Let's see. Are they ready? No, not ready. Not yet. Almost. And then? Hey. Hi. Okay. Go back to magdelena. You go see magdelena. Come here, pretty thing. Hello. What are you doing? We're, making conchitas for the fiesta. But you don't bake. I bought you that bread maker for Christmas. You never took it out of the box. That's not real baking, is it? Real baking, you... you mix the dough by yourself and knead it with your hands and get it in your hair and your fingernails. Yeah, I used to do that when I was a kid. Iseñorita, señorita! Ilas conchitas! Oops. Conchitas are ready. I'll see you later. Okay, I think they're ready, you guys. Come on, let's see! Come on, Mia. Thanks for telling me that they're ready. Are you ready? Hola, Juan. Hola, señor. We get the part? No, not yet. Well, did they say when? It's a difficult part to find. There were none. I think we're gonna have to order special. Well, how long is that gonna take? Well, maybe another day, maybe two. That's bad news. That is not bad news. That's good news. How do you figure? Well, if you know the part is now coming in two days, you can just relax, enjoy yourself, and not worry about it. If you're lucky enough, maybe three days. And if you're very lucky, it won't get here until after the fiesta. It all depends what you consider luck. Do you want buns? Very good! Very good! All right, so... And 1... 2... Conchitas are ready! Look how good they look. You know what? They look very good, but they're so hot. Very hot. So... It's siesta time. When we get back, it's gonna be cool. Yay! Okay? Let's go. Let's go. Come on, baby. I'm sorry. Yay! ♪ Let's sleep ♪ ♪ let's dream ♪ ♪ let's go to be to rest ♪ ♪ let's sleep ♪ Very good, guys. All right. Yay! There you go. I don't want to go. It's too dark. What'd she say? She's afraid of the dark. Honey. Well, then, you should stay right here with us. Come here. Look at that. Yes, yes. Here we go. You just rest right there. So, tell me, how did you meet your husband? My goodness. It was so long ago, I don't think I even remember. Stop. Nonsense. Every girl remembers. So, tell me. My goodness. Well, I was... I was working in a bank, and this very handsome man came walking in the bank and... and handed me a note. And I thought, "my gosh! It's a stickup!" But, no. The note read, "you're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen, and would you have dinner with me?" A proposal from a complete stranger. Well, he wasn't a complete stranger. I'd seen him at school. He was an engineering student, and I was a business major, but, but definitely not your most usual of bank transactions, I have to say. Apparently not. So, what did you say? Well, I said yes, of course. But only after he opened up an account with us... A savings account, mind you. And did he? He did. Yes, he did. I think he had to borrow the money from his roommate, but he sure did. That's funny. That's a really good story. Is she out? Yeah, she's pretty much out. Let me go. There we go. Gracias. Goal! Yes! No, no. Yes! No, no, no. That wasn't a goal. You want to see a goal? All right, I'll show you a goal, buddy. All right. You want to see a goal, big boy? Come on. You want to see... Come on. Your feet are slow. Are you kidding me? All right. Okay. All right. I see how you are, buddy. Okay, you want to play? Yes. I'll play you, although I do have to warn you... I was a starting forward for the west valley wolverines. Of course, that was 20 years ago. Goal! Pepillo! You're pretty good, man. You play pretty well for a kid with only one good leg. All right, here we go. Best 2 out of 3, okay? All right. Here we go. What do you got? Show me what you got. You ready? Let's go. You ready? Come on. A great goal! Who taught you how to play like that? My papa. When you have a son like me, you can teach him. Are you kidding me? If I have a kid, I'm gonna bring him down here and let you teach him how to play. No. That's papa's job. Really? And what's mama's job? Well, to tuck you in bed, kiss you, and, at night, sing a song to you. And did your mama sing? She would always sing. She would sing this nice song to me every time I finished my prayers. ♪ Go to sleep, my child ♪ ♪ go to sleep, my sunshine ♪ ♪ go to sleep, piece of my heart ♪ And what does that mean... Something about your heart? Not my heart. Her heart. ♪ Go to sleep, my child ♪ ♪ go to sleep, my sunshine ♪ ♪ you will always be in this heart of mine ♪ That's a beautiful song. I'm sure your mother loved you very much. Thank you, girlfriend. Tomorrow. She's crazy. Thank you. All right, so, it's your turn. How did you meet Juan? Well, I was straight out of the university in Guadalajara, and they said that they needed a teacher here in dommatina. So I said, "I'll go." My friends thought I was crazy because I was gonna leave the city to come here. So, my first day of school, I looked down, and there's pepillo smiling up at me with his little bad leg. And he goes, "my brother Juan is the best mechanic in town, "and he deserves a beautiful wife. Would you like to meet him? He's right there in the garage." How could I resist, you know? That's a good story, too. That must have been quite a change, though... I mean, living here. Do you miss the city at all? I did a little bit in the beginning, but then, after a while, not so much. I like this place. It's a good place to live, and the people are really good people. I mean, I have Juan. I have my work. I have all the children. What else do I need? Now, Juan and pepillo... They're brothers, right? Where are their parents? Their parents died when pepillo was very young. I'm so sorry. It must be very hard on Juan, having to be both a brother and a parent? Yeah, I thought it was... It was so sad at first... Pepillo with no parents. But now, I mean, the whole village takes care of him. They love him so much. It's like they're family. Well, so what happens after you and Juan get married? With pepillo? Yeah. I'll love him like my own son. But after you get married, you and Juan will want to have your own children, right? Sure, but it's... it's not up to us. It's up to god. If he wants us to have children, then perfect. We're gonna love them. If he doesn't, we still have each other. I mean, I believe, as long as I'm a good wife and he's a good husband and we love each other... If we do that, whatever happens, it's gonna be okay. See you later. Come to the shade. Hey, how's your leg doing, buddy? Good. Always the same. Want to know a secret? It's not another one about my wife, is it? No. This one's a real secret. It's something no one else in the whole world knows. That sounds like a pretty important secret. You sure you want to entrust it to me? Yeah, I do. You know how San Judas tadeo turned a little boy into a dove, and after he flew three times around the Plaza, he made it so he could walk? Yeah, father Arturo told me that story. Last night, before I sleep, I prayed to San Judas tadeo. And in my dreams, you know what he says? What? He says he will do the same for me. When it's my turn to fly and when it is over, he will make it so I can walk. He will fix my leg, and the pain will be gone. Are you sure that's what he said? "Pepillo," he said, "if you believe in the miracle of dommatina with all your heart, I can make it so you are healed." Pepillo, there you are. You can't tell anyone. Remember, it's our secret. Yeah, I promise. Good evening, señor Pete. Hey. Come on, pepillo. We're late. Magdelena has supper for us. Let's go. I see that you're finished. Yeah. You're getting much too heavy to carry. After sunday, I'm gonna be light as a feather. Him and his flying. You might actually think he's gonna turn into a bird or something. Hey, tonight, magdelena and I are going for a walk. Why don't you tell señorita Donna, and you meet us there? Yeah, sure. Yeah? Yeah. Okay, see you there. Come on. Sure hope you know what you're doing. Amen. Today, we finished the máquina. Father Arturo helped, too, but it was mostly me and señor Pete. You would like señor Pete. He thinks he is very good at soccer, but he's really bad. He's sometimes sad about something. I don't know why, but someday he might just tell me. I wish you were here... You and papa, too... But I guess you guys can see from up there. Turn off the light, little guy. Time to go to sleep. Is it really bad tonight? You worked really hard. It will be better. Okay. Let's do this. Good night, little brother. Good night, big brother. Sweet dreams. Okay. He doesn't know about the miracle yet, but it's better to keep it as a surprise. Buenas noches. Do you guys know that Juan was the boy chosen to fly once? It runs in the family, Were you scared? A little bit, but mamá and papá were there, so I knew nothing bad would happen if they were there. They would be so proud of pepillo right now. Yeah. Very, very proud of him. You know, I've been thinking. You've been thinking? Ha ha ha. What's the occasion? No, perhaps... I don't know... But maybe after we get married, maybe we could move into the city. What, and leave dommatina? Well, I just... I just think there would be more work for me there and, more opportunities for pepillo. And you say you like the city, too, no? Well, yeah. Well, señor Pete, you live in the city. Don't you think it's a good option? Well, the city's exciting. There's always lots to see and do and lots of great restaurants. You see? I told you it was a good idea. Yeah, but it's also very noisy and crowded, very easy to lose sight of what's important, like family and intimacy and the simple pleasures, all the things that you have here. You would leave your friends, your family, this place, just to go to a city? Why would you want to do that? I thought it would make you happy. Juan, I'm only happy because I'm with you. I love you, magdelena. I love you, too. Donna, you awake? Yeah. Have you ever seen a miracle? No, Pete, I have not. Did you see magdelena and Juan tonight? They love each other so much, you know. Just 'cause they're affectionate doesn't mean... Don't reduce what they have to puppy love, Pete. I wasn't. I mean, we... we used to be affectionate when we were as young as they are. We're still affectionate. To answer your question, no, I've never seen a miracle. Do you think they're possible? You mean the water changing into wine... That kind of miracle? Yeah. Yeah, a real, honest-to-goodness miracle. I don't know. Boy, I hope so. Or that's gonna be one disappointed little boy. Good night. Good night. Iseñor Pete! Iseñor Pete! Time to get up! It's morning! Iseñor Pete! Iseñor Pete! Iseñor Pete! Iseñor Pete! Iseñor Pete! ¿Señor Pete? Iseñor Pete! What now? Quickly. We must go. Why? The pilot. We must hurry! Let me just put on some pants. You got to be kidding me. What's going on? Apparently, they're bringing in a test pilot. Where are you going? Well, you're not the only one who works in this house. Shut up! What's the pig doing here? It's the pilot. The pig belongs to the pilot. No, señor Pete. The pig is the pilot. Sí. The test pilot is really a test pig? Sí, sí. Juan? This is one! Juanito? What's going on? It doesn't work. Nothing works, magdelena. Aren't you supposed to be helping father Arturo? I was there, magdelena, but then I came to see señor Pete's part arrive, and they didn't arrive. So I tried to fix it myself, and the wrench broke! So this is why you're so angry? The parts were supposed to be delivered today, magdelena. You know that. I know. I understand. But getting this angry isn't gonna speed anything up. Come on, babe. You're always trying to fix everything, and you can't do that. So why don't you just take a break and go help father Arturo, where you actually can help something? Hola. Hola. Torito. I love you, torito. I love you. Neh! What's a torito? Torito? That's a... it's a small bull. I just call him like that when he gets angry like that. Well, at least you made him laugh. Pete gets mad sometimes. I wish I could make him laugh. I feel like crying sometimes. Well, it's easy to make this one laugh, because he's not angry at me, really, or the part or anything. He just blames himself for what happened to pepillo, and he always gets like this. But that was an accident. Yeah, I know, but, you know, he wishes something else could have been done... Perhaps take him to the city, to a big hospital, but he couldn't do that, 'cause he couldn't afford it, so that's why he gets like that. He's very lucky to have such an understanding woman. I think I'm the lucky one, 'cause I'd rather have him care that much than not care at all. You have to be very careful. You have to tighten there. Yes. I know. Are we too late? Nope, just in time. Where's Pete? He's right there. He's helping father Arturo fly the pig. Pig? Yeah. That's our test pilot. Don't worry. You'll understand. It's a custom we have. Secondaries and the safety harness on him. Okay. All right. Let's get down. You need a hand there, padre? You okay? Wow! Flying meat! No. The pig likes it, too. Yes. Wow. He's going fast. Yeah. Unbelievable. Poor pig! How fun! Is everything okay? Did he fix it? I don't know. Um... What's happening? Maybe you should bring the pig in for a landing. No, he is going too wide. It would be unsafe. Better slow down a little bit. Um, padre, c-can I help? Yeah, yes, pull this rope as hard as you can. Okay. Pete, is everything okay? Careful. Careful. Harder. Harder. Pull harder. No! Stay back. Stay back. Take it down. Take it down. Take it down. Take it down. Stay with me. Aah! He's coming down. Get out of here. Get out of here. Get the pig! Get the pig! No! The pig! No! No! It's okay. I'm sure we can fly next year. No! Pepillo, where you going? Come back, please. You lied to me. There is no miracle of dommatina. It's all a lie! Padre... Padre, please forgive him. He didn't mean to offend a Saint. You're standing here, asking for forgiveness when he needs you? Go to him. Pepillo! What are we gonna do now? Can we fix this? No, it is ruined, and there's not enough time to fix it if we could. I have to tell the town that the fiesta of San Judas tadeo is canceled. Pete, can't you do something to fix this? What would you suggest? Well, you're the engineer. If you can build skyscrapers, you can certainly fix this, don't you think? It's not that simple. You can't just string it up. It has to be totally redesigned. Well, can't you at least try? Well, you're awful chipper, given the day's events. So... If I fix this thing so pepillo can fly, but he doesn't get his miracle, the kid's gonna be heartbroken. Of course, if he doesn't get to fly at all, that's gonna break his heart, too. Either way, that kid's in for a major disappointment. So... What do you think... Fix it or no? Pay or don't pay? Try to have a kid or don't? I don't know. What... no advice? No saintly wisdom to impart? You cannot blame yourself For the disappointments of others. You scared me half to death. I thought the old man had come back to life. Well, he is alive. He lives through his words... Like these. It says, "at first, do what is necessary, "and then do what is possible, and suddenly, you will be doing the impossible." You see, some people blame themselves for things they cannot do, for the disappointment of others, or their own failings. But in their distress, they forget that god does not expect us to be successful... Only faithful. We must remember this when even doing the necessary seems impossible. Well, but enough of saints and sinners. It's very late, and we both are tired. We have much work to do tomorrow to clean up. But... From this sorrow, some strength will come. Buenas noches, señor stanhope. Buenas noches, padre. What is it? What's the matter? What you said last night about what's necessary and what's possible... Do you truly believe that? Yes, with all my heart. All right. Then you better hurry up, 'cause we got work to do. Come on. All right, you see this? All right, that's where it started. The wall cracked, and the bracket pulled loose. Now, when that failed, the load got transferred there and there and over there. And as each one of those failed, the load doubled somewhere else. In engineering, we call it a catastrophic system failure. It's like when a bridge collapses. One thing leads to another. But it is how we have always done it. It's the only way I know how to do it. Look, what if I redesign the system for you and separate the load-bearing part from the controlled part? That way, if one part fails, you'll still be able to steer. Can you do that? Well, sure. It's just simple engineering. It's just pulleys and levers. It's not rocket science. The fiesta is tomorrow. Can you do it in time? Hey, if it's necessary, it's possible. Let's go. Let's go. Run. Come, come, everybody. Señor stanhope is an engineer from the north, and he has designed a máquina, a much better máquina so that pepillo may fly in safety, but we need your help to build it. Tomorrow is the fiesta, and we don't have much time. We have a lot of work to do, so I'm gonna need everybody to work together. What we have to do is totally rebuild la máquina. What's going on? Juan, can this be welded? I don't know. I can try. All right, thanks. Everybody, follow me to the Plaza, and I'll show you what I need you to do, okay? - Come on. - Let's go! Let's go help! Señor. Yeah? You would do that for us? How else is pepillo gonna fly? Thank you! Thank you so much. Thank you. Let's go. Put that bracket up there. That's it, Pedro. That's good. Good. So, are you basking in the glow? I'm telling you, these people are amazing. It would have taken my crew three days to do what they did in eight hours. Yeah? Well, it shows you how much it means to them. You know, I asked the padre if he wanted to do another test flight, and he said, "no, it's not necessary." So no more test pig? Well, the pig wasn't exactly Chuck Yeager. Iseñor Pete! Iseñor Pete! Come quick! It's broken! It's broken! Well, that was a short bask. It is no use. The metal is too old. It is impossible to weld. Maybe we can use something else. I don't know... another part that you might have, anything. No, it's no good. Without that piece, there's no way the machine can work. Señor Pete, can you fix it? Not this time, buddy. I wish I could. There's got to be something here that we can use, don't you think? Señor Pete, the parts are here... The wheel bearing and spindle. I told you they would come. Well, at least we can fix your car. Wait a minute. The spindle. If we cut it and modify it a little bit, it could replace the piece that broke. Yes, but if we cut it, we can't piece it back together, and there's no telling when we can get a new one. I don't care. Cut it. Bend it. Tie it in a knot. Whatever it takes. Yes! Really? What do we do now? Why, Pete stanhope... You're my hero. Yeah, yeah. A little higher. Keep going. Push, push, push. Good. Right there. Right there. Right there. Let's see. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go, kids. Hey, Juan. Hey, Pete. Hey. They left this for me to wear. Is this right, or is someone playing a joke on me? No, that's perfect. That's perfect. I'm glad to see you. I really wanted to thank you for everything you've done for us, especially pepillo. I've never seen him so happy and smiling all the time. Yeah, no problem. We're gonna see you tonight at the fiesta, right? I'm sorry. We're not gonna make it tonight. Pepillo's in too much pain today. Yeah, it's been a rough couple days on him. He's been working hard. You know, he's always in constant pain. He's trying to hide it from everybody else, even me. All he really wants is to be treated like a normal kid. Yeah, he's a good boy. I wish I had half his energy and his zest for life. Tell me about it. You know, to me, he's a constant reminder of what life is really all about. You know, if you've had a good day with the ones you love, you really don't need anything more. Everything else just confuses matters. Is it really that simple? You know, as shocking as it sounds, I really think it is. I wouldn't miss this for anything. I mean, just think... We could have been stuck in some boring little resort town like all the other tourists, but instead, here, we're like... Like locals, right? Yeah, sure. My gosh! The town is beautiful! Yeah, it's beautiful. Real beautiful. You know, you're awfully down for someone who just saved the day. Are you worried about the wires or something? No. No, it's not that. It's... It's pepillo. Why? He's thrilled. You should be, too. I mean, because of you, he gets to fly. No, it's more than that. What do you mean? He, um... He told me a secret... A secret I'm not supposed to tell anybody else. Well, do wives qualify as "anybody else"? He believes that San Judas tadeo came to him in a dream and told him that the first miracle of dommatina would happen again. Only this time, it would happen with him. What... he thinks his leg is magically going to cure itself? That's what he said... That he would fly to the base of the statue and San Judas tadeo would heal him. My gosh. That's why he thinks the Saint lied to him when the machine broke... and why you didn't want to be the one to fix it. It would take another year for him to get to fly, and hopefully, by then, he'd be too old. To believe in miracles. If he flies around the Plaza and lands at the feet of San Judas tadeo and nothing has changed... How do you explain that to a kid? I don't know. Neither do I. So, are you ready? As ready as I'll ever be. You sure about this? Positive, señor. Sure about what? What's the matter? Where you going? Well, it appears I've been drafted into the service of the king. The king? What king? King Philip III... Of Spain. That king. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait. You guys are absolutely sure no one else could do this? No one else can do it... Just you. Well, what about Juan? Why can't he do it? Because nobody wants to see Juan. You are the one that saved the fiesta, so you are the one that people want to see. Come on. Let's go. I'm going to see it, right? Yeah. Where? Coming here, right? Yeah, right? Where on earth is Pete? The parade's about to begin. He's gonna miss it. I wouldn't worry about it. He'll be here. Shh! Shh! Shh! Wow. Hey, sailor. Can you spare a few gold doubloons, perhaps? Yeah. Very funny. Well, I think you look very dashing. If I had to have my country conquered by any conquistador, it would be you. Well, thank you. It's funny... one minute, i'm a stranded American tourist, and the next minute, I am Juan cabrillo. If they could only see this at home. They'd never believe it. I don't blame them. I'm here, and I can hardly believe it. Thank you, father. Well, here goes nothing. Okay, you're starting to make me nervous. This is gonna work, isn't it? Guaranteed. Really? Yeah, 60,000 miles or 5 years... Whichever comes first. It's not funny. Welcome to the fiesta of San Judas tadeo. Today, we celebrate the miracle of dommatina when, many years ago, this blessed Saint came to our village to repay a child his kindness by transforming a crippled child into a dove. And when he transformed him back, the child could walk. So this year, as in years gone by, we celebrate this miracle with the flight of one special child to the feet of San Judas tadeo. This year, our special dove is little pepillo. Ipepillo! Ipepillo! Ipepillo! His spirit's so light, he could almost fly without our help. So let us bow our heads and pray. In the name of the father... So... donna, I've been thinking. Um, I've been really selfish about the whole baby thing. It just kind of... It just kind of felt to me that getting pregnant to you was the most important thing in the world... Even more important than us. Pete, listen... no, no, no. No, no. Just listen. What I'm saying is... If you really want to try again, I think we should. What about the money? We've got the money. Do you remember that savings account you made me start before you'd even go out with me? Yeah. Yes, I remember. Well, I never closed it, even after we got married. I always thought I'd need a little extra cash if the right opportunity came along, and, well, there's just enough money in there to get us started. If we need some more, then we'll find it. You'd do that? He's quite a kid... Totally fearless. You know, Pete, I have been thinking, too, and instead of us spending money to try and make a new kid, maybe we should spend it on one that we already know. So long ago. Pepillo? Yeah, we could take him and Juan to the states, get him to see a real specialist. You would do that? But I thought having a baby was everything. Having a baby would be wonderful, just truly wonderful. But it's not everything. The most important thing is us being there for each other. You know, if all the ropes and cables and wires were to come crashing down, we would be there for each other to help string them back up again. But just because we help pepillo doesn't mean we can't still try to have a kid of our own. And if that doesn't work, we could always adopt. You could love a child that wasn't your own? Haven't you noticed? Amén. And now our flying boy, pepillo. Hey! Fantastic! It's gonna be okay. I promise. Bueno. It is finally your turn, my little pepillo. Are you ready? Sí, padre. Bueno. Bueno. - Be careful. - That's it. Go ahead. Okay. Go to the edge. Bueno. People of dommatina, we present pepillo! Let's have a big hand for him here. Looking good, pepillo! It's the flying boy, pepillo! Go, go, go! Whoo! Watch me fly, Mr. Pete! Ifly, pepillo! Watch me! Nice job. Why, thank you. I do have an engineering degree, after all. The dove! The dove! Whoa! Whoa! Ipepillo! Look, I'm flying! You sure are. Whoa! Higher! Higher, padre! Higher. Good one, pepillo! Whoa! Whoo! Not very high. If it gets high, I get nervous. Yes! Faster, padre! Whoo! Yes! Okay. Yes! Let's go, padre! Let's go! Yes! Yes! Father Arturo. Okay, pepillo. That's enough, pepillo. Enough, padre. I don't want to get down. I want to fly. Look, you can't even reach me now. Faster! No, no, no. It's time to come in. Come on, now. No, no, no, no, no, no. No. No. No, no, no, no, no. Pepillo! Whoa! Ha! Ha! He should stop. Come on! He's going very fast, Juan. Say something. Pepillo, stop moving around like that. Pepillo, hey. Padre. Pepillo! Come on. Pepillo, you have to stop doing that! Don't move around like that. Hang on to it, padre. Father, we got to bring him in. Are you okay?! Are you okay? Pepillo! Pepillo! Pepillo. Shh. Quick. Go get the doctor. No, no, no, no. I will take him. No, no, don't move him. It can make it worse. Pepillo. Pepillo. Pepillo, son. I think he's coming to. San Judas tadeo. Pepillo. Take it easy. Pepillo, can you hear us? Pepillo, baby. You okay? You okay? What are you doing? What are you doing? I want to walk. What? I want to walk. Does it hurt? No, I'm good. Padre. You can move. Does it hurt? No, it's not hurting. Look at that! It's a miracle! Señor Pete, remember the dream? He's walking. Juan, look. Look! He's walking! This is incredible. If I hadn't seen it. Gracias, San Judas tadeo. Thank you very much. Did you just see what I saw? I am not sure. I think so. He flew. He landed. Yeah. And now he's walking, just like San Judas tadeo told him he would. Do you think we just witnessed a real... Miracle? Yeah. No. No chance. There's got to be some sort of logical explanation, like, um... Like when he landed, he must have, fixed his spine. Whatever was out of place got knocked back into place. Like one of those stories when someone gets bumped in the head and they lose their memory, and then they bump it again, and they get their memory back, right? Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Completely logical. Or maybe it was just the power of positive thinking. You think? Yeah, you know, when someone wants something so very much, they make it happen. Or maybe... Just maybe... We witnessed an honest-to-goodness miracle, the miracle of dommatina. Pepillo! Pepillo! Pepillo! Pepillo! Pepillo! Pepillo! Pepillo! Good morning. Have I told you lately how beautiful you are? That's sweet. You're welcome. You're very beautiful. Pepillo told me I should tell you that every day, so I'm getting an early start... Trying to make up for lost time. I'll get it this time. Buenos días, pepillo. Señorita, the bus... If you want a ride, you must hurry. Honey... The bus is here. It's time to go. Feels like we just got here. Well, I guess that's about it. We better get going if we want to get to the car-rental place before it closes. I want to thank you. Both of you. Without your help, there would have been no miracle. Well, we could say the same about dommatina. Well, then, we're all blessed. Go with god. Gracias. Thank you, padre. Hey, I'll be back in a week to pick up the car, and then you and pepillo will drive home with me. Hey, we want to take you to a good orthopedist and make sure your miracle stays a miracle, okay? Okay, señor Pete. Thanks for everything, guys. Gracias, señor. And you have to come, too. We have some shopping to do for your wedding. My gosh. You have a good man. You do. Don't let him go, even if he becomes El torito. I won't. I promise... not ever. Okay. Bye. Bye. Bye! It's a lot of paperwork. They sure don't make it easy to adopt a child, do they? I know we're gonna be just fine. You okay? Yeah. That was just the pepperoni, I think. We have antacid, don't we? Yeah. There should be some in the medicine cabinet. Okay. Pete. Yeah? You okay? I'm fine. I-I'm more than fine. You're kidding. You're pregnant? No. Yes. No, I'm not kidding. Yes, I'm pregnant. Yes! Yes! Yes, I am. Yes! Captions paid for by Larry Levinson productions
