I'm me translating you with Qatturainuk I told them me translator You know why I'm here? What did he say? Do you know why he's here? You just told me Since he noticed you he recognized it He really expects us to move to the settlement? Piugattuk His family you want them move to Igloolik? Canadian law that you have to live in the settlement to collect your Family Allowance You'll get money for your children every month Your kids have to attend school And your children have to learn from them You have a wooden house with a hot stove You get a wood house with a heater With your E-5 Number you just go doctor and doctor help you Your Identity Number with your Identity Number you can move to the settlement But I understand that you love this land out here He understands it's a beautiful land around here and you love your land but the school children have to go to school Daughter Get over here Tell him Children have to go to school tell him Children have to go to school you have to move Can you be separated from the kids all the time That's our challenge not to be isolated from the family You won't want to be all alone in your camp when your children move into the settlement Don't say yes This is our hunting area it's why we are living here That's right don't agree I want to keep hunting around here Plenty of animals around here What did they say It's a great hunting hunting hunting place here You're going to hunt seals today Yes we're hunting seals but we haven't seen any No seals yet What does he say How do you understand this Whiteman They're going hunting and we meet here they're hunting You say children get money we get a house we learn your ways What will our children do if they move there If they move where there's nothing to do If the family moves there you said there's heat monthly money and school what is the grandkids gonna do there With school they're educated to work study for getting work so they can earn their own money for their own living so they can be free to choose what they want to do Over there if they move they will learn, get government jobs to get money to buy things when they grow up When they get money what will they use it for What is money to us If the kids getting money what are they doing for it They're not supposed to earn money at a certain age its later on but you continue what you're doing you live in the settlement you can earn money from traveling around with people or selling caribou you are collecting money for everybody and you are the one who's giving out money for everybody we can continue with that that's a good plan but you are the boss So you can move into the settlement and help us help everybody your family members everybody to keep that control that you still have that control and you decide where the money should go still the same What can I do it's the government rules we have to find a way to deal with this heh You can earn money when you move to the settlement taking people out by dogteam You can sell meat that you hunt and take Whitemen around on the land That way you can save your money until you want to use it to buy something Money Where is he going I wonder what is money – Me too He keeps talking about money I wonder what he wants We don't know Do you want to worry your mother That might be a gun on his belt You can't ever marry a Catholic Don't you love your mother Stay with us Are you guys learning about money I heard about it but I don't understand it Money Maybe when you don't work they give you a carved face What is going on Good Good Well I'm happy to hear that Tell him I'm happy He's happy now Boss is happy now Me too I'm happy now Let's be happy So you want to move into the settlement yes Don't say yes He's trying to talk you into it Will you move to the settlement What would he do if I told him to move to my land If you lived there would you say yes You want him to live in Igloolik he's asking if he asked you would you yes would you say yes Right now we have a big problem all over the world I cannot focus on what I want to do any more I

around the world are dead killed slaughtered I don't want to live like that Yes out here is peaceful Can you translate what he's saying He's talking for a long time Out in the world people are being killed It's not about one family The settlement he wants to know he's going around to the camps telling people to move to the settlement We have to stick together stick together Now he wants people all together in the settlement and that's how the government of Canada have chosen to do it to help each other all Eskimos all Canadians in one Inuit are in one place people help each other I miss my family when I go around to save others' lives He's going to all the camps He's homesick for his wife and children He checks Identity Numbers to move people to the settlement I have to hunt people not animals criminals boom I don't like that If I could hunt animals good Times change What should we do Tell him He hunts Inuit he doesn't hunt animals when he's hunting Inuit following government orders people are killing each other fighting everywhere that's why government wants people to move all in one place This is nonsense What kind of human being is he how can people act like that Someone is teaching him Inuktitut doesn't have words for it What are you talking about Tell him this He's from Canada Canada will take care of him I'm from Kapuivik Go live in Canada he has home over there That is not your home Your home is in the settlement do you understand He says this is not your home He says the settlement is your home That's the law Kapuivik is my home my land yours is Canada Kapuivik is his home You Canada your home I have been disappointed by the white man Tell him that He's saying You you people he not much like I once took a Whiteman by dogteam from Kapuivik all the way to where Netsilik people live He went to Pelly Bay near Pelly Bay he brought a Whiteman from Kapuivik to Pelly Bay and all the way back He also came back Down there on the ice polar bears were everywhere The ice on the way Polar bears huge polar bears tons I was impressed by the Whiteman and I believed in him When we approached polar bears he took out his camera as his weapon When he finds polar bear his passenger his passenger took out camera and shooted for camera We were happy when we saw polar bears They both happy when they saw polar bear Our land was not Canada we had no rules to follow we hunted anytime we wanted The government didn't say anything about the law they could hunt any time they want One time we approached a bear he wanted to take a picture They approach a big bear and he wants to take a shot again I told him go closer to get a good picture He told him closer closer take camera yourself The bear was coming towards us that Whiteman spoke Inuktitut a little not like this one he starts shouting he ran back and handed the camera to me He started walking to polar bear he could speak Inuktitut a little the polar bear was coming he's shouting running back he gave the camera to him so he can get the shot When he gave it he told me go closer to take a picture As the guy gave the camera to him he said closer take a picture That Whiteman was my Anglican priest Person the guy was a priest I didn't say anything but I understood he thought his life was more important than my own life He saw the guy that he wasn't more important than the Whiteman When we finally arrived where we were going he started preaching to Inuit when he went to Pelly Bay priest started teaching We traveled all the way back by dogteam a whole month to get back He had to go back home he's made it for a full month on the way back We saw plenty of polar bears but after that camera time now when he saw polar bears he stayed on the sled to him now polar bears were like wolves He's coming home the priest when he saw polar bear the polar bear seemed to be wolf he stayed in the qamutik since When we returned here I thought my payment would be something special He came back He thought he's gonna get something When he gave me a payment after one whole month it was a bible He finally came home he got a bible he thought he was getting more but he got bible When he handed me the bible I thought of all the things he did when the memories came back I realized the Priest does not love me He came home and he realized that the priest isn't important to him Since that time Whitemen it's hard for me to try to please a Whiteman Since that happened he's been more of his homeland he's staying in his land more That's my story for him does he want to hear any more Story you asked that story Thank you He says thank you for giving him a story He's just thankful on the outside because he is a Whiteman Thank you So now you got a bible Now you have a bible It's from a
