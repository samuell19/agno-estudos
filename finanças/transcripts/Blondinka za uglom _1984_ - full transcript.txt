Hello Take a seat Everyone is seated? May I start? Thank you Imagine life one day will become simple for all Each of us will be happy, singing, carefree This time is very near - we will all become ideal people In each role we will be faultless Just as we are in love This will happen, without doubt While for now there is both laughter and sorrow So let us return to our time And exaggerate a few things We will ascertain with a touch of sadness and shame That we are capable of becoming heroes Unfortunately, not all the time LENFILM First Creative Union A fantastic story with a prologue, an epilogue and a musical commentary by Andrei Mironov Tatyana Dogileva Andrei Mironov In the film A blonde girl around the corner Script by ALEKSANDR CHERVINSKY Director VLADIMIR BORTKO Operators IVAN BAGAEV VALENTIN KOMAROV Artist VLADIMIR SVETOZAROV Composer ISAAC SHWARZ Sound Operator NATALIYA AVANESOVA Stage Directors: A.

Excuse me, will there be onions? He knows Tell me please, will there be onions or not? I am asking you, will there be onions? I am talking to you - will there be onions for sale? The Torpeda team is losing Goal! Another one! Yes, that was the last chance for Torpeda during the match What a possibility - such opportunities must be made the most of Zero - one, torpeda loses Please could you let me know, if there will be onions You will lose your amber ring in the bet, before you know it I am here about the onions Could you tell me...? You don't know? Please could you let me know, if you will have onions? Take the ring, if they don't want to play You know me, I would not feel sad to give away a diamond ring if only the bourgeious team was punished Stop it, I won't take it Take it, I say! My word is the law I will earn myself another one, no problem! I don't undestand... I honestly don't understand why our team keeps losing All the conditions are created for them They train all year - cars are there for their taking Free flats, trips abroad They have 60 million fans! And they still lose, the devils! Excuse me please, I am asking you again Will onions be for sale? There is no order in the team As they write in newspapers - people act like they have no responsibility No-one cares about anything No respect for their role Because people have become greedy Forgot how life used to be - only pasta to eat, but we were still happy. We would get together, sing songs And won, by the way Now everyone has everything but it is not enough If he is sacked from one place, he will go somewhere else Comrades, will anyone answer me? They think too much of themselves I tell my children - the most important thing is community Here is one branch, it is easily snapped Lots of branches make a broom - that can't be broken Football is a group sport - everyone has become too clever A person needs to have fear So, no-one knows anything? Young man, why are you shouting? I am asking, will there be onions or not? He does not want my soul, he wants onions Do not be rude to me! The queue sent me Young man, the queue could not have sent you as we do not have any such organisation Go to the hall, take the book of complaints and write in it I will write! Write A real beast, huh? How he looked at me You are a human though - you could have talked to him Next time he would have been wiser Maybe no-one told him how he should behave Maybe he grew up without a mother He grew up without Mummy, without Daddy - can't explain anything to someone like that A beast will never become a human A fool will never become clever Anyone can be made a human being if he is approached humanely Nadya, you exaggerate. Only in films can you make a person right In life, a person who all is lost for can't even be helped by his own mother I would have helped my son Yes Why are there no onions? Because the alcoholic heaver is asleep in it Go and make a human being out of him Alcoholism is an illness, which should be treated. Which one is the heaver? The new one, first day here today Only the grave will cure him Each one has his own fate, Nadya What fate? We do not believe in that stuff Reform him. For a bet! You don't care that a person is being lost Do you care? Yes If we do not help him, Rashidik, then who will? Who will save a person? Yes... a pessimistic vision Pessimistic? Why did you drink in the heat? You could die like that I do not think death is the most frightening thing A person cannot know if he has died - he simply no longer exists If you do not exist, why do you drink? Why? Did you get sacked from your previous job for drinking? No, I wasn't sacked An even worse thing happened - I committed suiside I've been dead 5 years and I can tell you - I used to be in love with you I do not even know your name Nadezhda What a miracle Come on! Pleasure to meet you Even though I have been seeing you every morning Where? You were leaving a magically green car Genas Chrysler You did not notice me I really liked you then And now? Even more Now I am a corpse I am in the afterlife Stop that! You are in our life, not the afterlife We will fight for you You are lovely Our professor in the narcotics clinic is a specialist in alcoholics If need be - I will arrange a specialist rehab centre, if you run away - we will catch you No problem. You will stop drinking Drinking is fairly disgusting I have nowhere to run - I really like it here Well done - realisation is half of your success What is your name? Nikolai Gavrilovich Like Chernishevsky Funny, isn't it? Why funny? A great russian name and patronymic A great one For a great person You needed to study I did study Not the right subjects, or with the right teachers Oh not the right subjects or teachers at all You see the point Your head hurts? It always hurts from something You persuaded me. But this is the first and last time No more alcohol in future. Here you go I brought you some cold beer What is this? Imported beer Drink it, don't be scared What a great thing - I've never seen one like it You haven't seen many good things in life in general That is why you have such pessimistic thoughts Pessimistic Come on. All right, let's get out I will get you cleaned up Just listen to me and all will be in order Help me a second No, he is with me I will arrange it so I can always see you Whether you want it or not we will make a human being out of you Do you want to be human? Very much No problem. All the roads are open for everyone, and for you too Simply you didn't have a goal in life up to now I had the wrong goal, and now none at all. I do not know what a goal should be Like everyone else. Everyone must be happy It is as though you fell from the moon That is a very creative way of putting it. Yes, I used to be the man from the moon Maybe you are not a drinker? I used to not drink I thought you were loading furniture into houses before starting to work for us No, Naden'ka, I used to work at the institute of space research, did research Up to day before yesterday That is who you look like! Like who? Like the TV show presenter in "World of Animals" As he starts saying "Scorpios are uniquely intelligent" I get goosepimples all down my back My kind of man A scientist Watch out! I used to be a scientist I used to be on TV too When? About 15 years ago Oh... I only watched kids TV back then Then everyone talked of space exploration, it seemed we would contact the aliens any minute I calculated the wavelength of the signal we would receive I waited 15 years for the signal from our "intelligent brothers" From Mars? No, Nadya, not from Mars. After all, it does not matter at all For 15 years I went all across town to the institute In the meantime - I was a journal editor, helped the police And waited Watch out! Did you wait long enough? No, Naden'ka, I never heard a signal I lost 15 years in vain You and I are the only intelligence in the universe I understood a lifter is much for useful for society He earns more too So you are not an alcoholic? Alas But you are still mad I have that from childhood Watch out! You seem to laugh a lot I laugh, therefore I exist No, you laugh because you are nervous and thinking all the time You could get into a mad house at this rate - you must seek distraction Do you have hobbies? No How come? You do not love books? Where can one get books? No problem - if there is a will, a spark A person can do anything. Do you want to be a booklover? I do That is it - you are a booklover I know a main officer in the bookshop - we will go to him tomorrow Do you want to see "Time-machine"? Very much. What is it? It is a rarity I do not understand Just do not stress, you will understand everything gradually What do they call you usually, just the name or patronymic? As you wish I will just use the name The name is good, you are almost still young What do your parents call you? Nikolen'ka Nikolai, let us go somewhere tonight. You need cultural rest, don't you? I'd love to but my Mum and Dad are waiting for me We could come in and warn them That is difficult Everything is difficult with you because you are... A pemissist... no a psesimist What difference does it make? None really I do not have the money for a social life Money does not bring happiness An interesting thought My own. Hold your head higher, you are young Everything is ahead for you A job does not define a man. And you need to eat more You need to eat more so you have the strength to fight Rashid you are like and artist in his workshop Why not, Naden'ka? The great Michaelangelo said: How do I sculpt? I take marble and remove everything extra I work like that too - I take meat and remove all the necessary Come on, work Marble That is for you Rashidik, make another 2 kilos of good meat For who? For the new one No, there is no need He is already eating with you Lokk what progress Rashidik, if creatures from other stars came to us, would you know what to talk to them about? Why not? About what then? You never finished high school About work. I'd tell them about my children Let them come, we would have a good chat The one who has no work or children has nothing to say I have everything It is a shame they will never fly to us Why not? Because no-one exists except us That is what a certain Comrade told me - the most important one in flying saucers A very interesting man Oh, it is ok, Nikolai! It will be heavy for you, you are not used to it Besides it is not a man's job to carry bags Nonsense. I always carry them What is your wife for? I do not have a wife. My parents are elderly We will make them happy That bag is for your relatives What is there? All the rare foods. We need to celebrate your first day at the new job No, this is completely impossible My dad will be furious, he has contempt for all indulgence He won't understand where it came from I did not tell him I left science I simply can't utter these words If only you knew, how much faith they put in me Nikolai, I had a thought just now I read somewhere you can get a room if you have a library So it is a really good hobby And if you have a dog they give you a room too No, for a dog only a few square metres Also, you should do sport Karate. A Sensei shops with us So no problem You promise? I am your slave Never ever argue with me. Because I know better, how it is best The bags Aha! The crocodile has made it Why a crocodile? Because of crocodile Gena in the cartoon. You like cartoons? Not very I love them My brother He is quiet, but terribly kind. He would kill for me Nikolai Gavrilovich, our kind of man Crocodile, take the bags and open the door Nikolai Gavrilovich, sit in the front you will be more comfortable What a beautiful car you have You probably worked abroad? Crocodile is a mechanic in the autoservice He has golden hands If you want he will make a car like that for you too I never thought about it You must think We have a tragedy as usual Regina dropped soap into the soup, so there is nothing to eat! Quietly, Mummy Come in then! No need to wipe your feet! Don't be afraid she shouts because her throat is not well Greetings I have worked in a school for 40 years I am a teacher, my name is Tatyana Vasil'evna Nadezhda That is my brother, Gennady Nice to meet you You are renovating the flat? No, we just moved recently Haven't settled in yet We are here for the third year, we used to live in the centre but the house is being knocked down No more questions How do you treat your throat? It is a professional illness - untreatable! Our department head treated hers - it was a professional illness too They wrote complaints about here every day - and I treated her in a week No problem. You will sing, Tatyana Vasil'evna You are just lovely, Darling! Aha, our beauty has appeared That is Regina, Nikolen'ka's friend I am mad - first the soap and now I keep thinking Do I put the gas on first and then light the match or the other way around? Always like that First I put the gas on First the match You need a branded Bosch stove - you turn a switch and it lights itself No problem Simple, like all genious things Regina, this is Nadezhda and Gennady That is how I life - in constant confict of body and soul Although, I am not alone. Life in general is a battle between soul and body Do you agree? I undestood you For now, let us go to the kitchen Let us put the kettle on together Please You must be hungry? Let us make a pizza I know an amazing recipe You cut everything you have in the house into little pieces Put it in the oven Only I do not think we have anything Did you buy anything, Nikolen'ka? Empty Oh, great! We will eat bread and butter like the English in Dickensian novels Nikolen'ka, did you buy butter? No How do you mean - I asked you to buy butter! I didn't see any I have some - no problem Darling, you are our saviour! Then let us sit at the table This is terrible - you will all hate me now There is no bread, I ate it Something came over me, I was daydreaming And when I came to, it turned out I had eaten the whole loaf Oh you, artistic people! You are all egoists But we love you anyway Inspriration needs nutrition The poet Krilov used to eat whole geese! Nikolen'ka- run off to the neihbours, ask them for bread You will scare everyone off, shouting like that I have some - Crocodile get it out Forgive me for the pause So that you can undestand the complexity of the situation The subtlety and issue here is... That while living in this world we something take evil for goodness We sometimes accept evil as goodness He is active, creating. Everything in life pleases him For him there are no questions or problems whether in day or night The difficulty always has been distiguishing good from evil regardless of the wrapper And telling the difference between angel and devil Telling the difference between good and evil, angels and demons Darling, where is all this from? From a shop You see, Nadyusha, I am torn between teaching and my husband, and Nikolen'ka is absolutely no good at shopping He grew up somewhat inactive I do not undestand how such a pessimist could have grown up in our family My words precisely This is my Dad Yes, I am his Father What did I always tell him? I always told him not to delay happiness for later What else did I always tell him? I told him our future is beautiful and full of light Work for it, love it and bring the present into it Whatever you can bring And there will be no problems! Lavrik, be quiet and let people eat I am Gavrila Maskimovich Nice to meet you. Nadezhda This is my brother Gennady Nice to meet you Nadyusha, dear, tell me - do you work with Nikolen'ka? In the neigbouring department - Which one precisely? - Gastronomical In the astronomical? Dad doesn't hear well Let us not talk of it Tanysha, we have some drink left over from New Years Let us go to the room No, Regisha drank it all to cure her cold Oh, what a shame I have some And no problem A young woman who is an astronomer... Nadyusha, are there many women? In your department? Oh, it is just girls I am proud of my job Wonderful Then let us drink for our lovely Ladies For your beauty and patience For your wisdom The thing is that everything in our fate is connected to you one way or another I once fell in love with a female Doctor The thing is, I... Oh.. what I have remembered! What? I think I left an iron on at home Are you sure? No, I turned it off, definitely Forgive me for God's sake, Gavrila Maksimovich, I always interfere It's all right Kolya, do not look at me as though I am an enemy Do such things not happen to you? No Let us move on. Listen to your father. Once in 6 months I am hospitalised for procedures Connected to my body wound Now I think I did not turn it off What to do? The main thing is that the procedure is done my the same wonderful doctor that I am in love with Excuse me, but if I left it, will there be a fire? Of course Quiet I am lying in the ward - and then there is a rumour that a delegation of Western doctors is coming to us They came to us too from different places Of course - let them see But, it is not only the doctors who come but the journalists Oh, that lot will write all sorts Exactly Should I go home? What if I go home and all is well there - I will never forgive myself Of course you should go - so you can calm down Gena will drive you I am just finishing I am very embarassed, but I will go after all You will not be offended? No, we will not I will not trouble you too much? Good-bye Good-bye, Regina Darling So where was I, the foreigners.. She askes everyone, who would like to be operated on? Everyone refuses. Then she approaches me The eyes, eybrows, her gaze, her eyelashes... The question in her eyes - well, I am in love Women, the devils, the feel your passion towards them Always! What should I do? It is a question of my Lady's honour I offer myself as a candidate Great! Don Quixote. You are a fool, not a hero Maybe I am a fool The guests come I am put on the table The my darling stars climbing around in my spinal chord Spare us the details I listen to it for the hundredth time and it gives me goosepimples The details God keeps, are they say My head is full of mist, my eyes of sparks I may not know english but I can see they are all impressed I pass out, but in the morning I wake up famous Gavlrila Maksimovich, let us drink to you! I have simply fallen in love with you, honest! And I with you! You, Nikolai are simply an egoist! You have wonderful parents and you should have done everything to create a great lifestyle for them Never mind, I will make a human being out of you I am already almost a human being I already want to... Have a green car A flat in the centre I want to do karate - it was my childhood dream to break a brick with the side of my hand But I always thought it is not for me But then who is it for, I do not understand? For who is it, if not for you? What did you parents want - for you to have all the best! You are to live in the 21st century! You are a human being of the future No, Nadya, you know It is you who is a person of the future No, we are all people of the future - let us drink to us! For us! I have had enough We haven't had a nice sit-down like that for ages! Plus, its the "week-end"! Let us go on a trip somewhere! No, Garik must not We can go to the restaraunt "Seventh Sky". Or to Church It is Easter tomorrow! I've never seen the Church Easter procession No problem! But the faithfull are there - and we will just stand like tourists But it is all right with me! Our Head of department shops there - a great man! I can guess who this is Hello? It's me! The iron was on! But turns out it burnt out ages ago - so there was no fire! Genochka was so kind as to repair it at once Then he went to the bathroom to wash his hands, saw that there was no light and mended the wiring So now we will wash in the light When it became light he saw the tiles are falling off, and now he is gluing them back They are calling us to watch the Church procession - but you must be terribly tired? I quite understand you - we will be right there later on Seems Crocodile and Reginka are getting delayed Imagine, only yesterday I was afraid to approach you And I was afraid to approach you You did not pay me any attention I did pay you attention - but it meant nothing to you It is interesting, why did you notice me? I just noticed you and that's it Maybe I remember you from childhood From childhood? I don't quite understand On TV You are joking? Girls always fall in love with who they see on TV Our Mother left us, Dad drank Grandad and the crocodile brought me up I loved them of course, but... I wanted to love someone else too So maybe I chose you Later I forgot you Now seems I have remembered you again Maybe you and I have already met in the past When? In previous lives They wrote in the "Technology for Youth" journal That maybe we have already lived other lives And we were different people in them Or maybe not even people, but animals Or insects But already met Nadya, don't Don't talk about it, Naden'ka Why? There are things we cannot judge We do not have the right to judge them I do have the right I am a blood donor of the second category You are a Darling, not a donor Have you ever given blood? What does blood have to do with it? No, I never gave blood I have allergies - my blood is not needed by anyone And mine is needed In the hospital, everywhere, for everyone I will say what I think and you are not to shut me up It was a stupid joke Take that What is this for? Tickets for you Easter Naden'ka, have I hurt you somehow? What do you know about anything, what? That's it. I am going to Pushkino, and you can go anywhere you want with your ugly girlfriend Good-bye What Pushkino, Nadya? I live in Pushkino, I do not have the Moscow registration So what? You will despise me even more now? You think I haven't noticed the glances you've been giving me I was glancing at you? Look at you, think you are Saint Nicholas Who are you to decide which rights I have and do not have Who do you take me for? He did not like my shopping bag with food It is not that I didn't like it... You think I steal I did But you ate! I did eat And your elite ate too What do I need you for, think about that! That is what I cannot understand I will survive without you, where as you will be lost without me Tanya, forgive me if I hurt you somehow Forgive me, please Fools steal, clever people live on their salary They help each other out of respect Who have you helped in your life? No-one That's it. Go to her, to her! Nadya! Forgive me! I am a scoundrel, I had no right to think badly of you That's it I said - go to her! I hate you Where should I go? Go to her, she is a sophisticated young woman I do not want to go to her I don't want to You wanted to for so many years and suddenly you don't want to anymore Scoundrel! Nothing happened We were simply friends Talked For ten years you talked Nadya, I swear nothing happened! We just drank tea and talked She is a lonely person, doesn't know how to do anything and is afraid of everything I pitied her You never pitied me once What is there to pity you for? She is not afraid of anything I am the one afraid I am afraid of you Of me? Who else? I dreamt of you my whole life and you think it's ok to mock me I do not need anything for myself I do not care about anything Maybe I waited for you my whole life so I could live and work for you, and you... You are ashamed of me and you laugh at me You always laughing at me Not at all, I admire you, Nadya Mocking me again? I am only capable of mocking myself Liar! You are always lying! When you say you are secretly in love with me, you are also lying! What kind of humour is that Please don't cry Don't touch me I am not worthy of your tears I promise I am not lying to you Every morning I saw you I thought with sadness how there were not such girls in my time There could not have been, after the war You are a child of a different era You are too... brave, too strong Too confident for me And I am afraid of you Can't you see? I never though I would be taken over by something like that We are completely different people, you understand that But it is a fact This morning I was parting with life I am in love with you No That is impossible It is possible Maybe I love you too I have nothing to gain from you, must mean I love you Laugh at me if you want, call me a devil if you want Or call me an angel Only I am yours forever now I am yours forever Let us do the repairs in the summer, not now During the holidays What? We will send off the parents for a holiday and create a proper interiour for them Or better change flats now Will we live just like that or get registered? You know best, how it's best Better to get registered Then I will have a Moscow registration and by myself a Vyatka What? I can buy myself a Vyatka - an automatic washing machine They are only sold to Moscow citizens Do you need time to think? To think about what? My dear one Time to think before registering the marriage As you like I have had time to think already Me too I heard they don't register you immediately They will - no problem Even tomorrow You want to do it tomorrow? Tomorrow! I agree Will we have a wedding? As you like We ought to For our closest relatives We can get together at our place Better in "Akselsiour" Where? It is a restaraunt, just opened I have never been there Crocodile will take us, we will hire a hall For two hundred people or so, no more. Yes? It will probably be very expensive... Not for you to worry about, I will borrow some money I only plan to marry once in my life Don't forget to get a photo taken tomorrow Why? For tourism - we will got on a honeymoon, won't we? Genious! We will put a tent up, wear trainers Why? Why? I will get some tickets for a boat cruise around Africa Spring in Africa is heaven Do you want to go to Africa? With you? Even to the end of the world! Aha, Crocodile and Regina are here Let us put our shoes on Drops have fallen on you, Darling It's ok, I have another dress and suit in the car Come on! Who could have thought - me in Africa A drink? Vodka, whisky, sherry? Whisky for me, only a tiny bit Otherwise I will start to behave inappropriately Nikolai, I think you wanted to tell them something Regina, a miracle has happened While Nadya and I were waiting for you, we decided to... We already decided to go and I started to get dressed But the zip on my back broke It goes from top to bottom, I am always afraid I will be left naked in that dress Hold you glass and let Nikolai speak You have already noticed I get in the way of everyones lives Regina, Nadya and I decided... You understand, the zip got stuck right in the middle Can't go up or down - a completely inappropriate story I sit and think, which way to pull it - if down then I may not get dressed today ever And if I pull up, it might break the zip Genochka was waiting in the corridor So then I decided to sew it up and dropped a needle down my neck Regina, let us be friends - I will give you a new dress, a french one Oh, could these be salty nuts? I like you - you are not standard Me too You see, I would still be sitting there and thinking now, but Genochka came in and saved me You can't imagine how hard it was for him to get that needle Then he was so kind as to sew me up himself It tickled incredibly and I laughed completely inappropriately Genochka never even smiled, like a true Gentleman Reginka, can you be quiet for a moment? You understand, when he sewed me up I asked him, who will undo me again? Before I go to sleep? Then he offered me to become his wife What do you mean he offered? Silently What a night And everyone is in love Like in Shakespear's comedy I never thought I would see so many religious people They are just as religious as you and me Then why did they come here? What do you mean, why? It is Easter - an ancient celebration The meeting of spring - we respect traditions Hi, Nadezhda! These are not just traditions It is a Church What do you think the Church is? Explain You do not know yourself? I am simply interested in what you think I think it is an open-air museum Ancient art, architecture and music are here It is an ancient tradition So people are interested Some people go straight from the registry office to a Church wedding Are you ideologically not against that? Ideologically, I am against that Shame Shame, we would have looked great by the Altar Let us get out of here Let's go Oh, that is who will get us a stainless steel sink! No, he waited for no miracles But he was granted the joy of suddenly falling in love Now he will have everything All that he dreamt and did not dream of There will be a happy marriage Right after which, our heroes will enjoy material posessions Almost all of them What next? What next? One can guess They will take from life all that it is capable of granting them Plus (how can I best sing this bit?) Plus a stainless steel sink. Is there any need to list These dreams are standard - they will have everything But again the question appears - what next? The question seems to be simple He is someone of international importance - how do you know him? I met him at exhibitions, conferences You are allowed into conferences? There are all our people there - writers, artists, famous actors How do you get in there? With Crocodile - without him they are without wheels It was always my dream to be friends with artists It never worked out Now it will be your usual crowd I do not think it will be interesting for them with me, who needs a physisist loser What do they need me for? You think they bear my company because I provide them with rare food Yes Maybe that is why you love me too? No Then for what? I do not know They do not know either - artists are obliged to love their people And I am the people - as are you, Nikolen'ka It is just that you are not in your best state now, but that's ok. I will sort you out The ununitable is uniting - serious things - and suddenly a stainless steel sink Because we have goals and dreams Growth of material well-being And exchange - the house in Pushkino, plus your flat, puls Crocodile moves to Reginkas Wait, wait, wait... One, two, three, four, five Wait! Six people - we have the right for a large living area Please stop Why? I beg you to be quiet You love poetry? Yes Read me a poem, for example... you love poetry? I don't know for example - " I desire to reach the deep meaning of all" "In work, in search for my path in life, in affairs of the heart" "I constantly must grab the thread of fates, events" "To think, to feel, to love" To make discoveries, let us try! Lift you head up and look up When you see this whole miracle - what do you think of? I think whether we should ask to be put in a new house or an old one What do you think? A new one is better No, an old one is better - less standard In Arbatskaya street Is that possible? Well, someone must live there, why not us? The house is emptied from inside and a new interiour is inserted What, a whole house? A bungalow. Now there is a communal flat there, elderly people finishing their days We will put the elderly in Pushkino, lots of fresh air While we protect in historical building, thus helping the government We will live in a palace I found one - a tiny one, but with columns! We will take you to a spiritual healer, check your biofield You will live forever! Do you want to live forever, little one? Do not call me "little one"! I won't, I won't But I still feel I am older than you If there is a fire, I will carry you out, and not you me Naden'ka, I feel dizzy It is ok, we will go to the sauna now and you will come to life To the sauna? To the sauna! Reginka, what is up with you? Probably I am a masochist I was so happy when Gena was hitting me with birch branches - I felt complete liberation Such things only happened to me in the conservatoire So, Nikolai A person is happy only if he is famous That is why you have to be famous We will show you on TV Yes, our supermarket is shown there often But even better on the TV show "The Obvious and Incredible" You can speak in more detail there - your Father would be happy What do you think about that? I think that I prefer port to vodka I always dream of drinking port I always dreamt of a friend like you I suggest a toast to your silence You know how to be silent - it is a great and rare gift Gena! Repeat performance? Or are you terribly tired? You are my "Obvious and Incredible" I will indroduce you to their presenter Does he shop at yours too? Little one, do I really irritate you with my chatter? No, no. I am terribly interested in all you say So, it is decided We arrange your TV perfomance About what? About what you like? About space creatures? Nadya, do not talk about that They about your current job - even better More unusual You will speak of your invention But I did not invent anything You will You will improve tools of your trade What is the tool of your trade? I drag a trolley along by a wire So... suggest replacing the wire with a string, and four wheels with three Overall in the country there will be a huge economy of metal And the radius of the turn will be lower for the trolley It already has three wheels Then suggest two It will fall Devil take it, let it fall Nikolai, understand. The show is not about how to make trolleys but about creative response To raise interest in art among the wide masses Well... agreed? How simple it all is After the show you will be noticed at once Immediately - and they will transfer you to an intellectual job Maybe to the institute of even the ministry of trade No, there will be another journal to edit there and you will run away To you! Well, then, the TV plan is off It is off. Trust me, I no longer dream of fame Thanks to you I feel something unknown to me previously One of peace in my soul And love for life I accept the world as it is I have faith in the future Today I started to also have faith in the present I am no longer a "psesimmist" I am in love... oh, and drunk Zhenechka!

Then we will put him in a university I haven't chosen which one yet But the very very best one Our Grandaddy will be terribly proud I will go mad from joy Then his whole degree course will be sent to "practical labour" And suddenly.. they will send a message saying there was a fire nearby He ran to put it out and the roof of the house fell There our son died heroically You are my only one My unique one Such things would never have entered my head I imagined it all so so clearly suddenly But I will give birth to him anyway Honest. I will give birth to him, won't I, little one? Of course you will We will dress you, do your hair. We have a wedding tonight Do my hair? By tonight you will be a prince A prince?

Look how much fun everyone is having Look how well everything is, Nikolai? Have so food, be happy What is it? Aha, here is our head of deliveries at the supermarket, Comrade Ogurtsov Why is he dressed like that, is he mad? Come on, let's meet him! He is with us, excuse me! Just a minute. Nikolai, I think you can be congratulated Thank you very much, we are very glad you have come But why are you without a tie? That is why you were not allowed in Just a minute An hour ago I was called at my country-house Nikolai, can you imagine what has happened? Yes. I got married So, you do not know anything? For the first time, a stable rhythmic signal has been observed at your predicted wavelength range It's for luck! Most likely... excuse me.. most likely, it is a coincidence, but... There is a possibility It is a signal from extra-terrestial creatures! On the day of our wedding, my little one! I think it is all very undefined so far But some hope has appeared Our brothers in intelligence. My little one, I was not mistaken in you You are a genious! It is more likely a "no" than a "yes" But possibly... "Yes", rather than "no" Yes, yes! I am sure it is a "yes"! This smells of a Nobel prize Wait Is there a recording?> Unfortunately there is no clear recording You, my dear, deserted us to be a lifter in a supermarket, and the girl who replaced you could not cope with the equipment So the moment is lost, we will have to wait To wait how long? Shut up Nikolen'ka, I am your wife and there are things I know better than you Now there is a hint that a signal has been received since you left work And you are standing and flapping your ears, why? Comrade Ogurtsov, were are old friends I do not understand what you mean, Dear We've known each other a hundred years, or have you forgotten? Oh yes You help me get hold of some caviar one time So we will got to Switzerland to receive the prize all together, won't we? Go to the guests, I beg you Of course, Dear. But we have a long way to go untill the Nobel prize There is some work which has to be done How much? Maybe a whole life will be needed for it Maybe ten lives Can't it be speeded up somehow? Maybe I need to get hold of something? Naden'ka, you get hold of salami sausage! A radiotelescope I will think Pay no attention You wife is lovely But the nearest free radiotelescope is beyond the Arctic Circle The conditions are very tough and you will not want to go there from Moscow I am ready to travel anywhere Right this second My friends! A moment of your attention! Just now, a grandiose event has taken place! My husband, Nikolai Gavrilovich Porivaev The head of Space Heard the voice of our intelligent brothers in outer space! We are not alone in the universe - there are many like us! Hurray! Swing him! Follow me! Don't touch me! You have no right! Leave me alone! Put me back! What are you doing? Let me go! Let him go! Don't touch me! Nikolen'ka! Nikolen'ka, a terrible thing has happened! Everyone dance! No, this is terrible Yesterday, I broke the phone. This time I smashed it into little pieces Genochka brought a new one, with buttons instead of a disk Now the police have come, saying he stole this phone from his workplace The wheels for the roof he took from some garage Other things are stolen from an exhibition Now he will be taken to court It's ok. A person made a mistake We will call the head judge, he will get two years on probation Regina, Nikolai, that is not the main thing. The main thing is that we are not alone! Somewhere out there, on other stars, other people like us live! People of the future! What nonsense are you talking! You said so yourself! I was joking It is true, Nikolen'ka, that is how it is We have a future, you, me, Regina. You have everything now, and we will buy what you don't have What are you saying! What future? Come here! Just look at him! He is the future, yes? This one is also the future? No, just you look at them! Kolya! Nikolai, where are you going? What happened, Kolya? Tell me! Look at me! Don't be like that, Kolechka I don't understand! I did not understand what happened, Kolya! Kolya, where are you going, stop! My good one, where are you going? Kolya, Kolechka, where are you running? What did I do? What did I do wrong, Kolya? I wanted as it is better, Darling I tried so hard for you Look at me - do you want me to fulfill all your wishes? Like the golden fish in the fairy tale? Kolechka, do not run away from me? I can't be without you, Darling, really! Really, I cannot be without you Kolechka, stop, please Oh, do not spend your life in vain On worthless details People love, and suffer, and look into the sky at night Do not allow yourself to burn up in unworthy issues For your soul to stay young, look at the stars more often For your soul to stay young, look at stars more often So as not to waste strength And not to betray yourself You must undestand what it is you live for Do not allow yourself to burn up for unreal dreams For your soul to stay young, look at the stars more often However... what am I doing? The story is not yet over Explain yourself slower, let me catch up and restrain you You will not be able to hide from love or run away from yourself The road into the distance is as far as life itself Wherever you escape to - love is calling you And there is the possibility of happiness Here is love, it calls, and happiness is possible Don't dissappear without trace suddenly Don't melt away into the distance Do not run away to the edge of the universe Do not circle the planet The path into the distance is as long as life itself no matter how faraway you run But here is love, it calls and happiness is possible The End.
