[breathing out heavily] [teammates yelling] [coach] C'mon, ref, that's a foul. [player grunts] - Time. - [teammate] C'mon! [ref blowing whistle] You guys suck. No, really? [coach] C'mon, let's go. [coach] You're looking good. Way to go. Nothing to worry about. It's fine. No problem. Hot out there, isn't it? Shouldn't have gotten in his way, Scottie. Hey, Scott, looking good out there, babe. Yeah, how would you know, Stiles? - You want to forfeit the game? - Yeah, what's wrong with that? - [Dragon's coach] No. - No? My players have league scoring records at stake. - It wouldn't be fair to them. - Just thought if we quit now you could beat the five o' clock traffic. There's a lot to learn from losing. Hey, we'll play if it's that big a deal to ya. [spectators clapping] - [teammate] Me, I got it. - [teammate] Over here! [coach] Push it up. All right, set it up! - It's not going too well, is it? - What do you expect, Thorne? Look at the sneakers those guys are wearing. If our guys had sneakers like that there's no telling what they could do. [teammate] Shoot! [teammate] We're all open. Jump it! That fat kid's got a great arm. [ref blowing whistle] Over here. Pass it. Forget it, dork. [Scott growling] [coach] Nice try. [teammate] I wanna get out of here. [coach] Hey, c'mon. It's not that bad. First game of the season, eleven more to go. [chuckling] Hey, it's just a game. You bozzo's better shape up out there. I can't do this all by myself. What is that? Liverwurst? [Chubby] What? I thought you were supposed to be on a diet, Chub? I don't know what you're talking about. [Scott] Chub, look at this. Give me that! Stop snooping around in my locker. Look, Chub, big guy, I can smell that liverwurst from over there. Oh, yeah, right. Underneath these? [Stiles] Woo-hoo, all right. Yeah, great game, guys. - We showed them. - [Chubby] We lost, Stiles. The umpire needed glasses. Terrific, Brad. - [Brad] Cheeseball! - Hey, Scott, you know that seven bucks you owe me? - You owe me. - Listen, Scott, this is important. If I don't come up with a keg for tonight, they won't let me into that party. Look, even if you come up with the cash, - Where are you gonna buy it? - [Stiles] Lend me five. - Later. Later. - [Stiles] Two. Hey, Chub, how's the diet? Hey, Lemonade, give me five, man. You were terrific out there, Lemonade. [Scott] What the hell is that? [cries out in pain] [Stiles] Hey, hey, Lemonade, my man. What it is? Listen, uh, I'm raising some cash for our school's Afro-American festival and I thought maybe.... Mick, can we talk? Hey, Scottie, come on in. Great game out there, today. You want a thigh or wing or something? No, that's not necessary, coach. Listen, you know, you know how you always said if any of us guys have any problems, I mean, even personal ones, that we should come and see you? Hey, that's what I'm here for. Great, because, uh, I got a problem. Oh, yeah? What kind of problem? As you can see, I'm a very busy man here. Ah, yeah well, it's, it's kind of complicated. Oh, those kinds of problems. Yeah. What is it? Drugs? Girls? Boy, I'd sure like to help you, but I'm really tapped out this month. The IRS is breathing down my neck like it's some kind of personal vendetta against Bobby Finstock. No, coach. How can I put this? [sighs] I'm going through changes. [chuckles] Oh, that. Don't worry about that. We all go through that. Some a little bit later than others. I'm sorry I didn't notice, but I haven't been hanging around the locker room all that much. No, [groans] you see, Coach, [stammering] I just don't think it's gonna be possible for me to play on the team anymore. Oh yeah, well... Look, uh, Scottie, I know what you're going through. A couple years back a kid came to me much the same way you're coming to me now. Saying to me pretty much the same thing that you're saying. He wanted to drop off the team. His mother was a, a widow, all crippled up. She was scrubbing floors. She had, uh, had this pin in her hip. So, he wanted to drop basketball and get a job. Now these were poor people. These were, these were hungry people with real problems. Understand what I'm saying? What happened to the kid? I don't know. He quit. Just a third stringer, I didn't need him. Yeah, Coach, I'm a first stringer. Yeah, and you already got a job working for your old man. Fact of the matter is, I should be coming to you when I need money. Fine. Uh... thanks a lot, Coach. Hey, don't mention it. Like I said before, Mi casa es su casa. [whispering] Thanks. [girls talking] - [Boof] Scott! - [Scott] Oh, hi, Boof. - [Boof] Hi. You going to work? - [Scott] Yeah. - [Boof] Will you walk with me? - [Tina] Catch you later, Boof. - [Tina] At the party. - [Scott] Bye, Tina... Sheena..? - [Scott] Tina? - [Boof] Tina, Tina. I had the strangest dream last night, Boof. It was bizarre. [Boof] Was I in this one? [Scott] Yeah. Yeah, you, and, and, and Pamela and a bunch of chickens. Boof, how the hell are ya? - [Scott] Say no. - [Boof] No! Great talking to you. - Chickens? - Yeah, big chickens. Giant chickens. Like fryers, you know? [Scott] You know, that guy was right. We do suck. [Boof] No news there. [Scott] 71-12. I don't even know what I'm doing out there. I'm sick of it, Boof. I'm sick of being so average. And it's not just basketball. [stammering] It's the school... it's this town, it's everything. I like Beacontown. I'd just like my life to change, you know, I don't wanna end up working for my dad at the hardware store. Your father is a terrific guy. Boof, look at me. Now try and be objective. Am I all right? I mean, is anything wrong with me? You should shower after basketball. - [Scott] I do. - Then, no. There's nothing wrong with you. Well then, uh, why won't Pamela Wells say two words to me? You can do a lot better than Pamela Wells. - Like who? - Don't you have to be at work? Hey, hey. Did I say something wrong? No, no. See you at the party, okay? - [Scott] Hey, Angela. - [Angela] Hi Scottie, how are you doing? What was the score? Very funny. [Harold]...fifty-three, fifty-- What was the score? [Scott] Seventy one-- [Harold] Don't tell me, I'll lose my count. Well, down to our last waffle iron. [Harold] You know these wrenches are made in India? How do they expect me to compete with the big boys, - I'm not Sears and Roebuck. - I'm not Sears and Roebuck. Well, I'm not. You look a little tired today, Scott. The coach is not giving you boy steroids or anything? Not likely. Maybe he should. We lost 71-12. You know, Beacontown hasn't won a ball game in... It must be three years. [whistle blowing] Ow! You know, don't take it personally, Scott. It's all part of growing up. Yeah. Uh, yeah, I guess so. Uh, any deliveries? [dog whistle blowing] Ow! [Harold] Yeah. A teacher at the high school. Some strange sounding guy called. Sounded like he was in a big hurry. [crying out] Today? [Harold] I'm not sure what I wrote down, but check the clipboard, that's what it's there for. Well, it is. [dog whistle blowing] It's broken. [Scott panting] A dog whistle? [Scott] Hi, Mr. Thorne. How are you, sir? Whoa! Thanks. [Mr. Thorne] Whoa! What an arm. Thanks, Mr. Thorne. I appreciate it. Oh, hell. I knew he was out there. I didn't actually hear him, but I knew he was there. I could only see a thin white crack of light which set my bedroom apart... [Mr. Lolley] More sensual, darling. We need to feel you, want to smell you. Hurt me, hurt me. ...from the dense and heavy darkness. [Pamela] But surely I could feel him. It was Nick. [sound of things being knocked over] What was that? Sorry, sorry sir. That, that was me. [Mr. Lolley] What do you want from me? Hmm? What do people want from me? I am merely trying to rehearse. Hmm? Ah, yeah. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I've got the stuff that you ordered. Wait. Are you from the hardware store? Uh, yeah. - Uh. - Ah! Uh... Pamela? Excuse me. Um, are you going to the party tonight, because if you are I'd like to give you a ride. The paint. My paint. A can of cocoa, a can of mauve. Am I right? Uh, right. [Pamela] Kirk, how was my reading? [groaning] Beautiful, darling. Very sensual. I'm still in pain. - [Mr. Lolley] Thank you - [Scott] Uh, you're welcome. Listen, about tonight... I, I mean, I'm serious. I'd like to take you. Uh... I've got a van. Hope your acting's better than your hook shot, boy. I already have a ride. [scoffs] Or maybe you were just acting like a basketball player. [Pamela] He just delivers hardware, Mick. Well, then maybe he should get back to delivering it. C'mon. [both grunting] [Pamela laughing] [Mick and Pamela laughing] [Mr. Lolley] I said mauve. Not turquoise! [groans] Mr., Mr. Lolley? Huh, the boss says I'm to pick up a keg of beer. - [clerk] Is that right? - The boss called you, right? - Can't say he did. - Well, hot damn. The boss is throwing a big bash for one of the boys down at the gravel pit. [chuckles] He just got paroled. [chuckling] Well, I've got, uh, plenty of bread. Here. There's a little extra for you. Got to see your ID... sport. - [Lewis] I don't even like beer. - Never... say... die. Dad? Uh... What would you say if I said I was thinking of quitting the basketball team? - Quit the team? - Yeah. That's pretty drastic, isn't it? I mean, you're not the worst player they've got. You know, your mother always said you could do anything you wanted to. Yeah, I know. Was just thinking of doing something else. Like what? [blows out breath] School play? Well... Theatre has its place, I suppose. What about your commitment to the team? To the School? Dad? Has anything ever happened to you that was so weird? Maybe it's time you and I had a little chat. Hey Mr. Howard. How's the king of nuts and bolts? - Stiles, nice shirt. - Hey thanks. C'mon, we're late. Boof going with you? Oh, yeah. I don't know how she's getting there. - Uh, is this okay? - No, don't worry, I'll get it. - All right, have a good time. - [Scott] Yeah. Be careful. Come on. Hey, hey listen, Stiles? Do you know anything about a rash that's going around? Why, you looking to catch something? No, but I'm serious. No... but I heard Mr. Murphy, you know, the shop teacher? Yeah. Got his dick caught in the vacuum cleaner. [both chuckling] Forget I asked. [Scott] Stiles, you're crazy. [Stiles] No, it's not crazy. It's perfect. Now you just stick this in your pocket like this. All right? You go in there, you don't say anything except... "Give me a keg, buddy." And you pay for it. That way he can't say you robbed him. You know I'd do this myself, but that old guy in there already kicked me out. Give me the gun. Give me the money. - [Stiles groans] - I'm gonna try and buy it. That's it. - No, no, Scott, - [Scott] That's it, Stiles. This guys is a ball buster and it won't work. - It won't work. - [Scott] That's it. Never... say... [chuckles] die. [shopper] No, no, no, no, no not that. Yeah. No, no I, I think I'll leave it. No, no, no, no. Thanks a lot, anyways. - [Scott scoffs] - [shopper] Bye. [shopper #2] Do you have any more of that melon liqueur? My sister really liked that. That's all. Yes, thank you. [man] Hey, Debbie, are you coming? [Debbie] Yes, listen, I would... Hi. Hi. Uh, I'd like a keg of beer, please? You don't say? Yeah. Uh, how much is that? Do you have any ID, sonny? You little bastards just won't give up, will you? Listen, no ID, no goddamn beer. Can't you get that through your thick skull? Give me a keg of beer. And these. [singing] ♪ Finding my way ♪ ♪ Ooh ooh ooh yeah ♪ What did you say to that guy in the store? Just, uh, "Give me a keg." - That's it? - Yeah, that's it. Well, Lewis. This is it. Tonight's the night. Pamela Wells is gonna be there and so am I. - And so is Mick. - He's not going to be there. Of course he's going to be there. They're going together, aren't they? No, they're not, they're not going together. [laughing] Mick is like 20 years old. Lewis. The only reason he's still in high school - is cause he did time! - I'm telling ya. - [Lewis] Time! Jail! - [Scott] Lewis, I'm telling ya. [Scott] They're not going together.

[all cheering] Yay! [all cheering] All right, Chubby baby. You have to eat this whole bowl of Jell-O. - Well, what do I have to do? - Hold the Jell-O. - [screaming] - [all cheering] All right, next up is... - Boof! - [all] Boof! Boof! Boof! It's, uh, Scott. - Whoa! - [all cheering] Booferino gets the Howard boy. I don't know if this is such a good idea, you know? You're gonna love it.

[Boof] I lied. I got Malcolm. [Scott] Uh, Malcolm's a good guy. You can come a little closer. I promise I won't bite. [all] Go, go, go, go, go, go! All right, Matchmaker Lady. [all cheering] Now, all you have to do is take this cup to Thorne's house, tell him you're from the Board of Health and you just wanna check his, uh, blood sugar. [Scott] Boof, uh, I feel kinda weird. [Boof] How do I feel? [all cheering] - [Mick] What is this? - Mick, you gotta see this. See what? I don't see anything. Come on. [Boof] Scott, aren't you getting a little bit rough? Hey, your fingernails! - It's awful quiet in there. - [all] Ooh! You guys think they're dead? [all] Yes! Hey, there's only one way to find out. [laughing] So, tell us. What's it like coming out of the closet? - It was unexpected. - [all] Ooh! [Harold] Scott? [TV on] Scott? [panting] [crying out] Jeez Louise. - [Harold] Scott? Can I come in? - Ah! Uh, no, Dad. Uh, no. I'm, uh, I am doing something in here. - I'll say. - [Harold] You may be surprised. Whatever it is, son, you can tell me. I'll understand. [crying out] No, Dad. Ah! No, not this time. [Harold] Scott Howard, this is your father speaking. Now open this door right this minute! [Scott] Okay, Dad. You asked for it. An explanation is probably long overdue. An explanation? Jesus Christ, Dad! An explanation? Look at me. Look at you. It's not as bad as it looks. Wait a minute, wait a minute, Dad. You knew about this? You knew about this and you didn't tell me? I was hoping I wouldn't have to. Sometimes it skips a generation. I was hoping it would pass you by. Well, Dad, it didn't pass me by. It landed on my face. What the hell am I gonna do? Scott, we really need to talk about this. [Scott] Forget it, Dad. I don't wanna talk. Go away. Tough night, huh? Yeah. Yeah, you could say that. On top of everything else, there was a full moon last night. Well, I, uh, meant to talk to you about that last evening, but you were kinda upset. Here's a nice hot cup of cocoa. Looks like you can use it. That'll help. Look Scott, being what we are is not without its problems, but it's not all bad either. Tell me about it. Well, for one thing, you're going to be able to do a lot of things the other guys aren't. Oh, uh, like chase cars and bite the mailman? When you want it, you're gonna have great power. And with great power goes a greater responsibility. Your mother and I learned to live with this thing - and so can you. - And what if I can't? I can look forward to a life of stealing babies in the middle of the night. And, uh, killing chickens. Fearing full moons, dodging silver bullets. Well, thank you, Dad, but no thanks. [Harold] Don't believe all that stuff you see in the movies. With certain obvious exceptions... werewolves are people just like anyone else. What I'm trying to say is... the werewolf is a part of you... but that doesn't change what you have inside. Look, Dad, I've got a bad outside hook shot. I'm allergic to eggs. I've got a six-dollar haircut. I mean, I have problems. I don't need this one! I gotta get to school. That went well. - Hello. - Hi. There's something different about you. That's nice. Did you change your hair? Missed you at lunch today, Scott. Oh, yeah. Hi, Boof. Uh, sorry, I forgot. I forgot. Well, I have to go study my lines. Kirk... Mr. Lolley... he's so demanding. - Bye. - [whispering] Bye. [school bell rings] How's it going, Stiles? The twins were abandoned and surely would have died in the wilderness if they hadn't been saved by a, by a what? A miracle? Yes, I suppose, but... what form did this particular miracle take? Scott Howard? [clears throat] Um... [howling] Very amusing Scott, but you are correct. The infants were saved and suckled by a wolf. A she wolf. Wolf. Wolf. Wolf. Wolfe! - Ah!... choo! - [classmates laughing] [English teacher] Thomas Wolfe. Don't you people ever read what I assign you? "Look Homeward Angel". Scott, it's a book. By Thomas Wolfe. Wolfe. Wolfe. [Stiles] Scott? Oh, come on, Scott. It's a lot simpler than it looks. [classmate] Uh, uh! Okay. [Stiles] Hmm! Just try, Scott. [classmates laughing] Ah, it's wet. You can't go in. [calling out] Oh, that's wet, too! Don't change, don't change. Oh, stay calm, stay calm. Stay calm. [Mr. Thorne] Little far from your side of the building, - aren't you, Howard? - No. I mean, yeah, yes, Sir, but the halls were wet. - Let me see your hands. - Sir? Let me see your hands now. You wouldn't happen to have a marker on you, would you? No. Uh, no, no, no, Sir. I've got my eyes on you and if you ever get out of line... [school bell ringing] Uh, Yeah, uh, I gotta go. Hey, what are you doing? Hey, big brother keeps a stash out here for emergencies. Are you listening? Listen, Stiles, uh, I, I gotta talk to you about something, cause it's making me nuts. Yeah, well, I knew you But if it's that intense, I'll need a solid buzz to think clearly. Well, look, I, I, I wouldn't even, uh... I wouldn't even mention it to you, except that I gotta talk to someone. Wait a minute, are you gonna tell me you're a fag? I mean, if you're gonna tell me you're a fag... I don't think I can handle it. No... I'm not a fag. [chuckles] I'm, uh, a werewolf. Where would that scumbag keep it? [Scott growling] Scott? - Scottie? - Stiles, it's me. What do you, what do you think? Can you do that... anytime you want? Uh... Yeah, I guess so. I mean, I just did. But, you see, sometimes, [stammering] it happens when I don't want it to. What can I say? You're beautiful. [chuckling and snorting] [gasps] Hey, uh... What can a teen wolf do? I can smell what you're looking for. - [sniffing] - [Stiles] The stash? No, I checked there. [Scott] Stiles. Stiles! This is just between you and me, okay? Yeah, yeah, yeah. TW. [laughing] Look at you. Tw, you're gonna be glad that you came to me with this. Yes, because with the right angles, man, we're gonna turn this into something... - Monstrous. - Stiles. - [Stiles laughing] - [Scott] Stiles. - [Harold taunting] - [Boof laughing] [Harold] Shoot it, shoot it. - No way, no way, no way. - [Boof screaming] [Harold] Don't foul me, don't foul me now. - [Boof] No, no, no. - [Howard] Here we go, woo-hoo. - [Boof] That--Yeah! - [Harold] Knock them down. [both laughing] - Hi, Scott. - [laughing] Hi. Boof came over for a little one on one. She's killing me. - [Boof laughing] - [Scott] What? What's so funny? Nothing. We were just chatting. Do you mind? [laughing] No, no. Hey, why should I mind? Well, I gotta get going. Would you like to walk me home? Uh, Boof, I just got here. [through clenched teeth] Scott! Yeah. Thanks, Harold, thanks for the game. Thanks for everything. You better work on that jump-shot. Yeah, yeah, yeah. - [Boof] Are you coming? - [Scott] Yeah. [Harold] Ha! Get in! [chuckling] [Scott] So, you guys were chatting? Harold Howard and his famous chats. Uh... What did he say? [Boof] Hmm, he just mentioned that... you were thinking of quitting basketball to work on a school play. - [Scott] Yeah. - [Boof] I can see why. She's very pretty, Scott. But she has a boyfriend. A very large boyfriend. [Scott] Look, it doesn't matter anyway. Cause the way things are going now, it would be better if I just stayed away from everyone. [Boof] Even me? [Scott] I couldn't get rid of you if I tried. [chuckles] - What? - [Boof] Do you remember? [Scott] How old were we? Six? - [Boof] Ha, five. - I wanted to run away from home but you wouldn't let me go alone. - I was afraid you'd get lost. - Yeah, but I didn't get lost. We just walked around the block because [both] our parents wouldn't let us cross the street. God, I thought they were gonna kill us when we got home. I know, but then when we did nobody even knew we were gone. - Did you ever tell anybody? - Nope. Me neither. Scott... if you ever need someone to talk to... if something's bothering you... I'll understand. Uh, not this time, Boof. You wouldn't understand. - I've gotta go. - Yeah. Bye. Okay, now, here's the drill. Play 'em man for man. - You know who you've got. - [Stiles] Hey baby, ten hut. Nice haircut over there. Be all that you could be. How was grenade, man? Hey, Lewy? Lewy, what's going on here? Is the president here today or something? - [Boof] Good luck, Scott. - Oh, thanks. Thank you. Hey, look at it this way, guys, it'll all be over in less than hour. Any strategy against Meechum, Coach? Hey, you guys are great, you've got nothing to be ashamed of. [ref blowing whistle] Now, go out there and give them hell. Go! [grunting] [ref blowing whistle] [coach] I'd say that's a foul. Let's go. Come on, set it up. [coach] C'mon, Scottie, up the line, boy. You can do it. [all groaning in disappointment] Go and get me some salt. Salt! Flick the ball back to him. Easy, easy. Come on. [teammate] Scottie, Scottie. Easy! Easy. - [teammate] Yeah! - [spectators cheering] [coach] C'mon, let's go!

Aren't you afraid of disappointing all your fans? Look, Boof, I can't help it if the whole town has gone wolf crazy. I mean, uh, this wasn't my idea. - There are some advantages. - None! [Stiles] All sizes. No waiting, everybody. Check it out. Right over here. Check it out. Hey Scotto, tip of the iceberg, baby. We are cleaning up! Boof! I got something for you. There you go, honey. Here we go. Check it out. All sizes, no waiting. - Elegant. - [Pamela] Scott! Scott! Listen to this. Kirk wants you to be in the play. He does? Wait a minute, Pamela. What about basketball? It won't interfere. It's a small part. Just for you. Here, Pamela, this is for you. It's too big for me. There are some advantages, Scott, admit it. You can murder my family. You can ravish my body. But I beg you with all that is decent and holy, don't destroy my plantation. [gasps] [sobbing] Sergeant! Burn the fields. And when you're done with that, burn the house. Ah, yeah! Uh, wolf, wolf, wolf person, whatever your name is. That was really... Thanks, babe, I love ya. ...something. [knocking at door] Come in. Hi. Close the door please. Uh, yeah. Relax... We're just one big happy family in the theatre. Yep. [Pamela] What happened to the wolf? Do you just change back and forth... whenever you feel like it? Uh, sure. Well, uh, sometimes I, I have to get kinda worked up to be the wolf, but, uh, it's not too hard. What do you think about to get worked up? Ah, different things. Wolves aren't supposed to be shy. Uh, Pamela? What are you doing? [Pamela] Oh, you are an animal. [howling in distance] [Scott] Strike! Five in a row. [giggling] [Scott] Okay. Did you know he was gonna be here? [people laughing] We had such a nice day today. Don't spoil it. [Scott] Okay. Got it. [Scott] Nice. Good, okay. Good form. Nice approach. Oh, poo! Boy, that was nice and warm. Okay. Address the ball. Okay, tuck in your tummy. That's good. Okay. Pamela, Pamela, Pamela. Here we go. Are you ready? Okay. Hey, creep, that's my girl. - Don't touch her again. - [Pamela giggles] [Scott] She's my date tonight, Pal. You don't scare me, freak. Underneath all that hair you're still a dork, Scott. I've handled your kind before. Your mommy used to steal chickens out of the backyard, till I blew her head off with the shotgun. - [Scott growling] - Right, Scott? [Scott growling] [Scott] So, does, uh... does that guy Mick always act like that? [Pamela] You could hardly blame him. He is my boyfriend. [Scott] You mean was your boyfriend? [Pamela] Is my boyfriend. But, uh, what about us? What about us? Uh, well, this afternoon. In your dressing room. Yeah? Yeah. Well, you see the spring dance is coming up and I-- And I already told you, I'm going to the dance with Mick. - [ref blowing whistle] - [spectators cheering] [a loud burst of applause and cheering] [Scott] Hey, Chubaroo, nice game, guy. [Chubby] Yeah. - At least we're winning. - You mean he's winning. When do the rest of us get hands on the ball? What good is being in the championship if none of us get to play? It doesn't matter how you play the game, it's whether you win or lose. And even that doesn't make all that much difference. Hey, guys. How about a celebration, huh? Chubby, ice cream sundae-- [Chubby] Ah, I'm on a diet, Scott, remember? Brad? Glass of milk? I don't get it, coach. What's their problem? Let me give you a little advice. There's three rules that I live by. Never get less than 12 hours sleep, Never play cards with a guy who's got the same first name as a city, and never go near a lady who's got a tattoo of a dagger on her body. Now, you stick with that, everything else is cream cheese. Great game there, Scottie. Thanks, Coach! [Scott] Whoa, whoa, whoa! Stiles? Stiles, where the hell did you get this? Hey, Harry's Used Cars, man, we traded in the Nova, even swap. - [spits] - Even swap, get out of here. How much extra did you pay for this? It's an even swap. For certain considerations. - What? - [Stiles] Lookey here! - Ah, Stiles. - [laughing] Hey, surf's up? Yeah, yeah, surf is definitely up. Why, let's go pick up Lewis, okay? What? Stiles, come on, what is it with Lewis? He's avoiding me right? He's scared of me. Look, man, we've got fine new wheels, we got some good tunes and a total disregard for public safety. You're right. Okay, let's go. - All right, baby. - [Scott] Surf's up. Wait a minute.

Uh, yeah. Sorry, uh, I was with Stiles this afternoon. I know. [Scott] You saw? Yeah, I saw. Unless that was another werewolf doing a handstand on top of Stiles' wolf mobile. And making a fool of himself? Look, Dad. I'm trying to get a grip on this. I really am. Is Thorne still on your back? Yeah, Thorne... some Neanderthal named Mick and the entire basketball team. Well, you've dug your own hole with those fella's, but, uh... this Thorne business is my fault. What, uh, what do you mean your fault? Goes back a few years. [sighs] As you know... I loved your mother since we were kids. We always knew we were meant for each other. But for some reason Rusty Thorne set his cap for her too. And no matter what we tried, he just wouldn't go away. One night... things got a little physical and-- And you turned into a werewolf. [Harold] Out of anger, Scott. I turned into the werewolf out of anger. Right in front of his beady little eyes. [scoffs] Was he scared? Scared? He lost control of his bodily functions. Ah. I wish I could've seen that. It wasn't a very nice thing to do. But it worked. After that, he never bothered your mother and me.... But to this day... I don't know who was the most frightened that night. Rusty Thorne... or me. You gotta get a hold of it, son. - [Boof] Morning. - Boof. Uh, what's up? Nothing. Why does anything have to be up? I just thought I'd walk to school with you. [Scott] Ah. [Boof] Got any plans for the spring dance? [Scott] No, uh, hadn't given it much thought. [Boof] I'm surprised they haven't decided to call it "Teen Wolf Ball". Will you, uh, go with me to the dance? I'll think about it. Is that a yes? Yes. On one condition. - [scoffs] - You take me to the dance. I thought we just established-- You, Scott Howard. Not the wolf. [sighs] No, no. Look, I gotta be the wolf, I mean, that's what everyone expects. Is that what you want? Everybody likes the wolf. All right, almost everybody. You said it yourself. I mean, if I go as Scott Howard I'm gonna be average. And dammit! Why do I have to be like everybody else? That's not a problem for you anymore. [sighs] And I guess, I don't have a date for the dance. [Scott] Look, Boof. I'm sorry... I can't. Hey, listen, uh... You'll till dance with me, won't ya? Even if I'm a werewolf? Yeah, I'll still dance with you. [Boof giggles] - [Scott] And feed me grapes? - [Boof] Don't push your luck! [Scott] Tickle my paws? She's right. You are an animal.

We need to see the wolf. So wolf out, huh, wolf up, wolf it. Whatever you do. Uh, pronto amigo. [stammering] Mr. Lolley, uh... I've been doing some thinking and I decided that I'd... rather play the part as me. - Whoa. - [Scott] Well, play it. - Play it as myself. - Well, that... That wouldn't be theatre, would it? See, no one wants to see you. Well, like I said, I'd rather play it like this. Okay, I see. [stammering] How am I gonna put this to you? Uh... Look at it this way no wolf, hmm, no wolf, uh, no part. What do you think? Wow. Bummer, huh? [Stiles] Hey, Scottie. Well, look at it this way, Boof. At least I'll have my Friday nights free. Even if you're not gonna be the wolf anymore, do you have to quit the basketball team? Oh, c'mon, Boof, are you kidding? Look, you've seen me play basketball. I suck. They want the wolf, I can't give it to them. Hey, wait a minute. Wait, wait just a minute. What's going on here? What are you guys talking about? [Scott] Talking about the wolf, Stiles. I can't do it anymore. You saw what happened. - Scott, are you crazy? - Yeah, I think maybe I am. Scott, you've got the championship basketball game coming up in less than four hours. Man, you've got everyone depending on you. - Yeah, Stiles-- - What are you gonna do? Let down your, your, your team? Your school? This whole town? What about me? I've got a very large investment going on over here, Scott... Hey, Scott, do it for me. [school bell ringing] [Scott] I gotta go, man. Scott, help me out. Do the right thing. That's all I wanna do, Stiles. That's all I wanna do. [spectators shouting abuse] [spectators] Boo! [ref blowing whistle] [spectators] Boo! [coach] Time! Chubby! Chubby, get time. - Come here. - [ref blowing whistle] - See that? - [spectators] Boo! Come on. [coach] That's a purple heart, kid. Smart basketball, Brad, taking a charge like that. So where's the wolf? - Uh! Not today, coach. No wolf. - [spectators] Wolf, wolf, wolf. Oh, good idea. Wait until the second half. Build up their confidence. [Scott] Coach. Look, coach... no wolf! Not now, not ever. I wanna play, but I gotta be myself. Okay, but we're gonna get our brains beat in, you know? You sure you won't change your mind? I don't wanna go back out there. I've had it. Yeah, this is all your fault, Howard. I think we can take these guys. That's terrific, Scott, now when do we get to see the wolf? No, Chub, I mean it. I think we can win this. Look, this is the championship. Now, it doesn't matter how we got here, we're here. If we're gonna win, we gotta pull it off ourselves, we don't need the wolf.
