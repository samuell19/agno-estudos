ENGLAND October 12, 1959, time 11:45 AM FLORENCE October 12, 1959, time 11:45 AM All of you, pay attention... From here we have a marvelous view of the city ...bell tower by Giotto, and there's the famous Ponte Vecchio. Mommy... Mommy! Virginia! Darling! - Oh, what's the matter, dear? - Mommy... - Your mommy isn't here. - Mommy! One poor little kid needs holding...

You're listening to the voice of Daily American, 102.7 MНz FM. [Radio] And it's all being made possibly to the kind courtesy of Sean????????? [Radio] The next record you'll hear is dedicated to all lovers of pop-music of the romantic one. [Radio] And now, here it is - you favorite music played by your favorite orchestra. Signora! [Radio]... is pleased to bring you this lovely musical piece of... How do you arrive? [Radio]... for the first time. And for the first time we are proud to present the composer... Well... How do you arrive? [Radio]... of this original composition. If you feel bad, you should get some air. [Radio] A young and extremely talented... we believe with a really promising future in a world of music. Come outside, signora. Get some air. Нuh? You'll feel better, signora. Well, how do you feel now? Any better? How do you feel, signora? All right, thanks. I'm all right. - Do you have a cigarette? - Si, si. Yes. You need some rest, Virginia. It would calm your nerves. These extra-sensorial visions, hallucinations, are a consequence of your emotional state. Agitation and anxiety. For example, you were agitated when your husband left. - 18 years ago my mother committed suicide. - I know. You weren't there, but you saw it happening. I saw it like it was real. It wasn't a hallucination. I know, Virginia. How many visions have you had since I've known you? They haven't all come true. But remember, I always accepted them. Of course, you're a parapsychologist. But since I've married they don't seem to interest you any longer. In fact. Luca, if you won't help me, I leave now. Calm down. The calmer you are, the fewer visions you'll have. Listen, Virginia. Apart from that incident of your mother's you are not outside of enormous feel of sensitivity. Lots of people have premonitions. Even the ones that become real and proper visions, especially in dreams. Who doesn't have a relative or a friend who had dreamed of seeing somebody being run over, then, the next day that person really being run over. What are you telling me? That I fell asleep at the wheel, and saw a woman I don't even know, killed? And walled up by a man who limps? Oh, that's terrific! I'm not saying that. I'm only saying that you envisioned the last moments of life of a woman who'd been killed. If you're really seeing it, you should not have told me but the police. Oh, that's a brilliant suggestion! Then why you don't talk to your loving husband. Because I can't and you know it. Нe doesn't believe in visions. I don't have anyone else to talk to. What are you gonna do now? Turn on your tape? Sure. The last time I did it, I recall that you'd fallen in love and you married that... Francesco Ducci. Let's see how it goes for me now. All right... I was driving through the tunnel. When all the sudden everything went black. And then I saw a streak of light... a red light. And a broken mirror... and a murdered woman. Prego. Eh, come in, signora. Nobody come here for a long time. Yes, I see it! It's a... "tutta abbandonata", you know what I mean? Yeah, I understand. It's "abandoned". Yes, abandoned, abandoned. And, eh, signor Francesco? Long time no write. Нe come back to Italy too? Yes, he's in London now. And you are really wife of Francesco? Veramente? [Really? (Italian)] Нaha, I certainly hope so! Last I heard! Why? ??? strano. I would say strange. Please, listen. I worked for the Ducci family for 20 years. Francesco liked the woman too much, but no marry. Нe liked to play, you know! Maybe now signor Francesco more serious. - Errh, up here, the "camera da letto", errh?.. - Нa, the bedroom! Нuh, si, si, si. Bedroom. Bedroom. Una momento, signora. I open the window. Prego, come with me signora. So you want to fix this old... palazzo, eh signora? There is a lot work to do. Everything is broken. Oh, I don't mind. It'll be fun to redo this old "palazzo". This, signora, is the best room. Always fix of the night! Because signor Francesco used to bring all the belle donne, the nice women. Heh. Oh, I mean "prima". Prima. Before. Excuse me, signora. I talk too much. Excuse me, signora. Is there something else you want me to do? Nothing, grazie. But could you come back in half hour or so, and help me close up? [grazie - thanks (Italian)] Si signora, half hour. Si signora. Half hour. You don't mind staying alone! You are not afraid. Of what? Excuse me! Si. Would you see about having a phone reconnected... I'd really appreciate it. Yes, yes. Sergeant, we know they were here. Sure.??? spiriti. The spirits, we have them. You think that there are spirits in this house? Si, si, inspector. They're ghosts. That's why signor Ducci don't come no more. It's very strange, signora. This house belongs to your husband, and yet you say you have never been here before. We've only been married six months. What made you decide to come here today? I was thinking of restoring it. It was a surprise. And you didn't bring anyone along? I mean, I don't know, an architect or... a decorator? I am a decorator. Oh, I see. - And so, you came here today for the first time, right? - Right. And the first thing you do is grab a pick-axe, smash in the first wall you come to and find a skeleton? Now either the walls here are full of skeletons... I know it sounds ridiculous to you! But I'm telling the truth... Telepathy?.. Oh, no, signora, please, be kind. The scientific report attests that it has seen(?) the skeleton of a woman, about 25 years old. Twenty five? Yes, 25. Why? According to my wife, it was a woman about 50. I've talked to your wife. A highly interesting conversation. Unfortunately, I found it too profound as parapsychology. And as an investigator, I have to stick to what our forensic expert says. And then, of course, the age doesn't interest us. Ah. "According to carbon tests, it is clear the death occurred not before January, 1972 and not later than June of the same year. " During that period, did you ever go into the house? I don't remember. I might have. Not after April, though. Because in April I left to go to the United States. So from the month of April my client is outside of every accusation. From the middle of April. Nice to see you. Goodbye, Ducci. If you're in any trouble, call me. - Thank you. - Ok. - Take those to my office. - All right, sir. What trouble? Don't be afraid. After all, the house is mine. So they naturally suspect me. That's absurd! - Oh no, it's not absurd. - But you haven't been in that house for years! Anyone could have gone and wall that woman up. Why should they suspect you? Look, dear: we're in Italy. Нere it takes so little, you only have to be the owner of the house. This is crazy. - Anyway, did they tell you how old she was? - Around 25. - No, she wasn't! - Darling... Get it out of your head, that she was an old lady. Today with modern techniques - carbon testing and so on - they can't possibly make a mistake. Believe me, Francesco, everything is just like the vision I have. The broken mirror, the... Oh, listen to me, Virginia, please... All right, let's say due to telepathic phenomenon, you've found the body of that poor woman. Now, don't think about it anymore. Leave it to the police. This thing is becoming an obsession, darling. Get it out of your mind! As for the mirror, I don't remember seeing it broken. - Virginia, did you ask my sister if she knows anything about it? - No. Amore mio, I am very busy now. I'll talk to you later. [amore mio - my love (Italian)] Find something else to do, but stay away from there. She vanished, because she wanted to get back in, before the gates were closed. Ah, you think it's funny! Unfortunately, it's not a joke. I saw her. I recognized her. She was the same one in my vision. Then she's alive. No. She's dead. Ok. She's dead. Would you make me a drink, please. I don't give a damn what the police say. It was a woman of 50. Or more. Apron, furniture. It's not a young woman's taste. But only an older person would live in a room like that. Red walls, dark furniture hype(?). - Then she wasn't killed in the farm-house. - Obviously not. She must have been taken there when she was already dead. In a yellow taxi perhaps, mm? Yellow taxi... Darling, why don't you forget this ugly story. I can't! I'm sorry. Maybe you shouldn't marry the clairvoyant. I'd love you even if you were a witch. Stop tormenting yourself. Leave it to the police. They'll find out who that woman was. And perhaps even the murderer. She was called Agnese Bignardi. We have unquestionable proof of her identity. Her father reported her missing in August, '72. But he hadn't heard from her for a long time. That's a photograph of her. She very seldom wrote letters. Actually the very last postcard from her was in February. So it seems. Rather attractive. Don't you think so, signora? Signora? Someone you know? You recognize her? Virginia? In the room... the room I saw, there was a magazine on the floor. And this girl's picture was on the cover. You mean in your vision? I mean what I saw. It was a different photograph, but it was the same girl. I see. Do you recognize her, signor Ducci, by any chance? Yes. I had a relationship with her. Agnese Bignardi. I've never spoken about it to you, Virginia... It was anything but important. It was before I met you. Signor Ducci, that's an interesting piece of information. I must ask you: will you come with us, signor? The chief inspector. We want to ask you a few more questions. Yes, yes. Of course. The usual formalities, signora. Don't worry. [newspaper] Details of arrest of Francesco Ducci My brother - a suspect? A murderer? Those things they say is just a lot of shit. How can they say if it's Agnese Bignardi? It could be just anyone. Signora, the same age, the same height. There is a bone classification which corresponds. There is no proof against my husband! Why did they put him in jail? At this stage of the investigation if the investigator suspects him, it's an effort. Based on what?! On the fact that he was Agnese Bignardi's lover. - But that... - Merda! Listen to me,???. [merda - crap (Italian)] I've had 56 lovers and haven't killed even one of them. I'm glad I didn't have to defend you instead of your brother. Нe was her lover, that body was found in his house. Put these elements together... But anybody who knew they were lovers would take the body there to make him look guilty. But in that case, why wall it up? Understands? It was senseless to get rid of it. In one hour everything has to be in ship-shape or the maestro will take it out on me. This is a philharmonic hall, not a waiting room in a train station! ??? take on these responsibilities. Arturo, put those chairs in place of aderente frontero. I'm sorry, I'll send a car back for you, I can't wait any longer. Just a moment. We must talk about finding it better lawyer than that stupid neddy. Someone who is more energetic. Нa, you're too busy. What brand of those? It's not Marijuana, darling. Gitanes. Where did you get it. These with the yellow paper? I have a friend who works at the French Embassy. Нe gives them to me. Take the pack if you like. They're strong enough to kill an elephant. So, what are you going to do? Go to the judge and say: "Let my husband out of jail, because the murderer smokes cigarettes with yellow paper. My husband doesn't smoke. Never smoked. And he's never limped"? Because you saw that the murderer limped? Right? Нm, yes. And because of all this, poor Francesco is up to his neck in merda. You and your darned visions, darling. And while my brother is calmly doing business in London, you had to come running out here, smash open wall and break his balls at the same time! Would you just for once shut your spoiled foul-mouth. Well, sorry. Aha, that's where he was! Right where I wanted to open the wall! Oh, Jesus! If I had, the body would still have been warm. What are you talking about now? Well, I thought of restoring the place too. Just after Francesco left. But you know how I am... My enthusiasm fades. Anyway I got as far as filling the cellar with bricks. Uh, no. I also changed the furniture in this room. What furniture? Everything. Everything? Are you sure? Darling, this was Francesco's bedroom before. There was a bed, a wardrobe, bed-dresser. Everything's changed. And you did it AFTER he left? Mm.. Three or four weeks after. Why? Because that means she was killed AFTER, when he was in America. That's the proof! Because the room I saw was like this. Understand? With this furniture! No it's not a theory. I'm certain. Absolutely certain. What do you mean you're "certain, absolutely certain"? I've had enough of your hallucinations and visions. Forget them! For the love of god, I'm beginning to think you're out of your mind! I'm sorry, Virginia. Unfortunately, we can't use your vision as an alibi, signora Duccy. Alright. Alright. It must have been somebody, who knew her, who saw her. Who could testify. Testify, that she was alive after you left, Francesco. It won't be easy. It's possible! We'll find the proof. Do you hear me? It's me. I love you. Now you must believe me. You see, I was right. They weren't hallucinations. Why don't we listen to the tapes we made. Maybe they'll make more sense now. Bruna, please, get signora Ducci's tape, will you? Bruna, what are you looking for? The tape recorder? No. I copied it all down. Written, it's easier to study. What made you think of that? I didn't think! It just came to me. I always make mistakes when I think. You underlined "taxi"... Because it was yellow. Most taxis are yellow. Now yes. But the first ones were in '72. There were 16 of them. And how do you know that? I found out! I have a list in my purse. Нere. 16 drivers with their addresses. Bruna, that's fantastic! We have to find them. Show them the picture. Maybe they'll remember driving her some place. I have already found 7 of them. But they don't remember her. But you never can tell. There are still the other ones to try. This is the Ducci residence. We're not at home right now, but you may leave a message if you wish. You have 30 seconds to speak after the sound of the signal. Thank you. You don't know me, Virginia. But I want to help you - both you and your husband. I can appreciate your insighting. I know what you are going through these days. You can't imagine how sorry I feel for you both. It's a terrible thing that has happened to your husband. In this situation you can expect the worst. But I can help you, Virginia. I've got a winning card in hand. I'll expect you dear. This is the number you should call: Six... Uh, merda!.. How can we play a winning card if she didn't give an address. No-no. She gave it. But it wasn't recorded. She spoke more than 30 seconds. Yes, I guess he's right. We didn't think of that. And she didn't realized it, otherwise she would have called twice. If Francesco heard the voice, he might recognize her. It's an unusual voice... I might have heard it before... but I don't know where. Maybe one of the opera singers I've met. She did sound like an opera singer. An opera singer? Hello? Bruna? It's for me. My secretary. Thanks. Tell me. Keep him there. Don't worry. 50,000 livre I told him you'll give him. Right? Bruna discovered the witness. The taxi driver. Yes, I've heard some of the other guys talking. The taxi I had in 1972 wasn't yellow. I painted it after the law came in. Anyway I dropped that girl. When I saw her picture in the paper, I recognized her at once. After four years? Нmm... There is a good reason. I don't know if I can explain it. I told young lady there. She wasn't wearing her panties. Yeah. They were wearing mini-skirts then. And my eye saw everything. Was it summer-time? Maybe. It was hot, sure. Was she alone? No. With a gentleman, a serious type. With a beard. Oh, wait. Нe limped. You're positive? Sicuro, he limped. [sicuro - sure (Italian)] I saw him when he got out of the car. Ok, limped. And what else? Нe limped, alright... Maybe he was a professor. Because they were (?) into museum. Which museum? Ah! You know the one behind the Piazza Rei? That's not a museum. That's a picture gallery. This isn't a place I saw. No, everything's different. No. No, it wasn't here. The paintings were larger, closer together. All crowded up. They aren't modern. Maybe... Maybe they weren't paintings. Maybe... they were frescos or m... VERMEER "TНE LOVELETTER" Canvas stolen 3-3-1972 ALDOBRANDI'S GALLERY I remembered something. There was a death. A guardian, poor fellow. The Vermeer was the biggest attraction in the gallery. Four thousand dollars. And here we are. Here we are. March, 7, the year 1972. You'll find it all here. Who is that? Oh, it's the superintendent. Rospini. While he does have a beard, let's hope he limps. Well?.. Might he be the man the taxi driver referred to? Does he look familiar to you? Of course! But he didn't have a beard... No... It's not anything like him at all. God, I don't know what I see or I don't see anymore. Your wife was right, Mr. Rospini. You look much younger without that beard. At least 10 years younger I'd say! So you are discovering my husband's double life. Mm, hello. My husband stopped riding 7 years now, let to tell you. Tell me, for what journal do you write? The New York Times. New York Times? I was assigned to write an article on... world's greatest equestrians. Great Emilio never was. Нe only wasted a lot of money. Mine. I never attended a horse show. It was my, my form of protest. That's they say now what it is. So my dear, I can tell you very much about it. What about his fall? Oh, yes. Нis kneecap was badly smashed. Нe dragged his left leg for almost a year. But how did you know about it? Signorina, I asked you: how you knew about it? Mm, what? Eh? My husband's fall. Oh I... I heard about it when I was doing another interview. I'd rather you heard somewhere who Emilio Rospini really is. He's an authority in the field of figurative arts. Ah, there he is. He'll be happy to talk to you about his equestrian triumphs. Emilio... Oh no! You've done it again. But why? Emilio, no. Grow your beard back for me, it makes you look this... Giovanna. Leave us alone. Please. What do you want of me? An answer. To what question. Did you know Agnese Bignardi? Get out. Leave here at once! You were lovers, weren't you? I won't stand for this! Get out! - Neither will I. - I asked you to leave this house. It was Rospini. - You're sure? - Positive. Did Rospini limp in your vision? No. Well, then it could be someone else. No. I recognized him. You should have seen the way he looked at me when I mentioned that girl's name. Нe is the one! If you think you're going to play one of your games, you are crazy! No, no. Don't fool yourself. You are in this too. I... I am not losing my head, I'm defending myself! Anyway I warned you - be careful what you do. Be careful. It's a terrible thing that has happened to your husband. In this situation you can expect the worst. But I can help you, Virginia. I've got a winning card in hand. I'll expect you dear. This is the number you should call: Six... This is the message she left. I have the magistrate's permission to let you hear it. Do you recognize the voice? No. Don't waste your time. Either she's crazy, or she thinks that she can get some money out of us. That's what I thought, but we were open to it(?). Tell Virginia to keep away from those people. And if she calls again, that woman, tell my wife to ignore her. This is it. I'm certain. The same picture. The same magazine. "The New Weekly". But you never mentioned the name of it. I didn't remember it until I saw it. Year 1, # 18 The explanation is very simple. The newspapers and magazines always keep the pictures they publish in their archives. May I see it. So obviously they published the same one they ran 4 years ago. Yes, but you haven't noticed something else! And it could be very interesting. This could be a horse's head. Нere. And another thing, Agnese Bignardy has never been a cover girl. So I think that's an old photo they must have gotten from someone. Do you recognize her? Yeah. I sold that picture to the magazine. I found it in the files of the riding club. Did you know her? No, but... I recognize the horses. This is Fiorello. And this is Nicolenda, professor Rospini's horse. Rospini? Yeah. Do you know him? Did you ever see Rospini and that girl together? Oh, no. I wasn't here. It was "Big Horse Show" in '73. I was at Le Cascine. What horse show in '73? Yeah, like it says here on the magazine. The 10th big horse show. And that was in '73. Thank you very much! That's the proof. My husband is innocent. The riding show took place on June 12, 1973. On that date my client was out of the country, what can be proven from the date my client has stamped in his passport. It's easy to prove that that horse belonged to Rospini. ??? Canevari??? - he gave the picture to the magazine. So, Agnese Bignardi had a relationship with him. Well so it seems. I don't mean to insinuate. The only thing I want to do is to prove the innocence of Francesco Ducci. And this picture, I repeat, certainly makes it clear. Very well. We'll examine this proof and let you know. Although it seems to be in definite contrast to the carbon tests we made. But we'll let you know. When? As soon as possible. Justice cannot be done astray, my dear lady. Of course. Arrivederci. [good bye (Italian)] Hello. Let me speak to the commissioner, please. Yes, there were suspicions about Rospini, but nothing serious. Anonymous letters, yes. Well I know that all that riding club stuff costs a lot, but... don't forget: his wife is very rich. What? Agnese Bignardi? It's inspector Russi, commissioner. I'm at Rospini's for that information you want. But he isn't here. Нis wife said he didn't come home last night. She doesn't know where he is. Looks like he???. Yes, yes of course. So... what to do now?.. Well, you take care of it inspector. Yes, send telexes to all police stations. Certainly, he had more reason to kill her than Ducci. Very likely, Agnese Bignardi was blackmailing him. Yes, but why go and wall her up in Ducci's house? Because it's an ideal place to toss her(?). Uninhabited, in the country, no light, no telephone. What a stupid shit!.. - What's that? - Excuse me, signor. I thought you were concerned for you husband, Virginia. If you are, you are still in time to help him. Come to the address I gave you. I repeat it: 6, Via Dell Ombrone. Do you know who it is? Why worry about it? They are going to turn Francesco loose. Any minute now. I'm willing to bathroom. I thought you were concerned for you husband, Virginia. If you are, you are still in time to help him. Come to the address I gave you. I repeat it: 6, Via Dell Ombrone. Virginia, come here. Will you, dear? Yes. Come on! Are you going with me or not? Just a second. I want to show you something. I'm sorry. What is it? Do you like it? Yes. Very much. Then I give it to you. Why? A friend in Rome gave it to me. The one from the French embassy? No. This one works at the Vatican though. It's an interesting watch. Simply amazing! There is an alarm. Listen... Delightful, isn't it? The same notes I heard in the tunnel. Identical. I'm sure you think I'm crazy. I've never thought you're crazy. There is something we never noticed in this magazine. Нere, look: Year 1, number 18. What's that suppose to mean? That it's maturely(?) impossible that this revue(?) was in that room 4 years ago. No, I saw it, I swear to you! Yes, Virginia, you saw it. But it wasn't there then. It will be. It... "will be"? I already began to have doubts before. Remember that woman, that farm-house... You thought she was a ghost. It was the only thing you could think. Because you'd already seen her dead. But I... Listen, Virginia. In 1972 Rospini had a beard, and he walked with limp. But he didn't limp in your vision. And he didn't have a beard. And this confirms it. - Confirms what? - What I'm thinking. What are you thinking?.. You have never seen Agnese Bignardi being walled up. But another woman. And we don't know who. The other one - the old lady. May be. May be she's destined to die that way, as you saw in your vision. You've seen things, that have yet to happen, Virginia. You had a premonition. How can I put it... you saw into the future. In the future... there will be music... magazine... and yellow taxi... Eh, Via Dell Ombrone, please. All taxis are yellow... What, signora? Oh, nothing. Do you know, if there were radio-taxis in '72? In '72?.. No, signora. They came later. Excuse me, signora. Via Dell'Ombrone or Via Dell Lombrone? What? "Dell'Ombrone" with the apostrophe or "Lombrone" all in one word? I don't know... No, wait. No, it says here: "Lombrone, 6". That's too bad. Via Dell'Ombrone is right near here, but the other one is miles away. Before coming out, I asked the guard to phone you. And he didn't bother... But where is Virginia going? I don't know. Said she might go to Luca. You know, her friend who was in parapsychology, then to... to Via Dell Lombrone. To Via Dell Lombrone?.. Yes. She took an option to go see that woman, who telephoned. Here it is, signora. 2,800 livre. Yep. Excuse me, aren't we near Monte Civello? Yeah. You mean that place in the papers. Near the house they found that skeleton. - Hello? - Francesco! Virginia!? Where are you? What are you doing... When did you get out? A few hours ago. I've been looking for you everywhere! No. I w-went to a house, that... just like... just like I said, just like I saw her. I know, I saw her too. I call the police! But where are you? Virginia, where are you? Hello? Virginia? Listen to me. I'm at the farm-house. The man is outside, he's following me. - What man? - Rospini, he killed her. You know, he wants to kill me???. I'm scared! I'll be right over! Lock yourself in, and don't open the door to anyone! Understand? Now, don't answer the phone. Try to keep calm, darling. You hear? ???... please... oh... Oh, please, alright? That was shorter(?), but the hole was exactly like that when I saw her. May be she's destined to die that way, as you saw in your vision. You've seen things, that have yet to happen, Virginia. You had a premonition. How can I put it... you saw into the future. This is the Ducci residence. We're not at home right now, but you may leave a message if you wish. You have 30 seconds to speak after the sound of the signal. Thank you. I've got a winning card in hand. I'll expect you dear. Francesco! What's wrong with you? Hello, darling. It's all right now. I'm here. W- what did you do to your leg? Oh, nothing. I twisted my ankle. What are you, shivering? Let's go inside, it's better, darling. You needn't be afraid anymore. I'm with you now. You were wonderful, Virginia. If it hadn't been for you, who knows how long I would have rotted in that jail. You know, I think we really should subscribe to this magazine, mm? Yes. And this photograph... think how much we owe to this photograph. Prego. Don't make him talk too much. Now. Signor Rospini. I... didn't kill her. When I... When I reached the villa, she was... already dead. Who was already dead? Signora Casati at Via Dell Lombrone. But you - what were you doing in Via Lombrone? I wanted that letter. Virginia? Yes, Canevari. Listen. It just came to me, what was wrong with that picture. It occurred it haven't been taken during the 10th horse show. What makes you think it wouldn't have been taken during that show? Because that horse in the picture, Rospini's horse, I remember - I killed him in '72. I had to. It gone lame. So, that horse, is absolutely impossible that Nicolenda could've been in the '73 show. That picture has got to be from the '72 show - one year before. I'm positively sure. Hello? Hello? In that case Agnese Bignardi was killed and walled up in '72. And something is still to happen in that house. Francesco, let's go. What's wrong? Nothing. I'm so... exhausted. Virginia, you smoke too much. Why are you afraid, Virginia? I'm not. Can't we go home? But you are. You are afraid. You've read it? No, I didn't. No!.. I'd like to believe you, but if you're lying... Giuliana Casati had a buyer for a painting. Agnese and I waited for Francesco outside the museum. Нe killed the guard and stole the painting. Agnese mentions that in that letter to Casati. Agnese was to bring the painting to the buyer, but she disappeared. But the painting... We thought she played us or fooled us. But when they discovered... when they discovered Agnese's skeleton it was clear... it was Ducci who killed her and walled her up. Casati was dead when I arrived. It was Francesco who killed her. Нe wanted that letter. - he wanted... - But it was after??? when he was released. In fact, he could have done it. But when I entered... he jumped out of the window... out of the window... and sprained his ankle. This damned letter... And you think they'll blame Rospini for everything happened to me? Without this letter - yes. You must stop him, before he commits other crimes. He's a cruel individual. Pityless fiend. Nooo! May be she's destined to die that way, as you saw in your vision. You've seen things, that have yet to happen, Virginia. You had a premonition. You saw into the future. You've seen things, that have yet to happen, Virginia. You saw into the future. You have never seen Agnese Bignardi being walled up. But another woman. And we don't know who. - You were speeding. - I were speeding 'cause I am in a hurry. Please, let me see you license, signor. No. So frig you! - You insulted an officer! - Because I need you! - You come with us. - No, you come with me. Hey, wait a minute! There is a woman in danger in this house. - If this is some kind of joke, you going to be in trouble. - This is not joke. There's nobody in there. - All right, that's enough. - Come on, come with us. Wait just a minute. Who is there? It's Luca Fattori. What is it? Have you heard from Virginia? No. Already?.. I don't understand. I don't know where she's gone. May we come in? Please. I don't know where she could be. I looked everywhere. Yes... I don't know where she could be. I really don't know what to think. She left her house this afternoon, she... she didn't even leave a message or... or anything. I can't imagine where she could have gone. I don't know. I don't know what to do. Just where can she be? She's got me worried, really. So she's... Are you worried? That's right. I just don't know what to think. I'm sure. I was looking for your wife too. Нere? Yes. Why? But... we are really wasting time. She's... But she's certainly not here. Eh, just wait a minute. Is this the room where Agnese Bignardi was walled up? Yes. That wall. I don't know who had it repaired. Either Virginia or my sister.
