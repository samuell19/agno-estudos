GREY AND BLACK Never did a stronger flame melt stone until it fell into pieces. It's an image in black and grey that frightens me. Raul Brand?o 'A house on top of the hill' Is everything okay? - Yes. This is yours, 115. I'm in 110. - Thank you. Do you want to have a have a drink? - No. Are you hungry? - No, thank you. Sleep, sleep, my child Sleep, sleep, my child Night has already come Go to sleep... in your mothers arms. In your mothers arms Good evening... - Good evening. What's the house drink? - Gin tonic. What's there to eat? - A grilled cheese sandwich. Pico or St. Jorge cheese... What do you prefer? St. Jorge. - That's fine. Are you passing through? We all are... Everyone who passes through the island comes to this bar? Not everybody, but all the travelers, sailors and tourists do. Anyone who crosses the Atlantic comes here one day or another. Many sailors leave messages for each other... or else send them here. Can I look? - Of course. If I wanted to disappear, could I find someone here to take me? We hold mail. We're not a travel agency. On the islands, there are no whalers or pirates. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, Ulisses' beloved son rose from his bed. He dressed himself, girding his sword on his shoulder... and binding his sandals on to his comely feet. Leaving the room, he looked like an immortal god. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn appeared... Rosy-fingered Dawn... He was here! He was in this guesthouse in this room! How do you know? - By the smell. He was in this guesthouse in this room! Show his photo to the man at reception. I already told you not to meddle in my work. Can we exchange rooms? - Now? I won't be able to sleep in that room. Bring your things here... Take care, girls. Don't worry. I'll be back soon. Did you manage to sleep? - I did. Did you dream about him? - I never dream. What part of Alentejo are you from? - From a village called Gloria. What did your parents do? My mother died when I was small. My father was a farmer. We lived on a small hill in the middle of the countryside. When he died, I closed the door and hit the road. Do you have siblings? - I do. How many? - One brother. What does he do? - Survive, like me. Where? - I don't know. The photo on the dresser in your bedroom, is it the three of you? You like to rummage in others' things? Were you always like this, so bitter? I don't have any reasons to be sweet. When I was little, my father told me every day... that history doesn't favor the weak... and that we shouldn't chew over something that was bothering us. Hi, traveler! How are you? Fine. And you? I don't know. I woke up with a cold chest and a worried heart. I brought you a gift. Did you go to Pico? I did. I live on Pico, Marina. I bought a house on top of a mountain. I have six cows, a viola and one book. I'm not a traveler. I don't like to take boats as I can't swim. If you'd like, I can leave now... but I don't want to keep lying to you. Hug me. I don't know. The photo isn't very clear. He may have been here, but I don't really recall. Weeks ago, a guy with a hat and a stubble beard came here. Maybe it's him. He didn't identify himself? - No. He said he didn't have his identity card and paid for the room in advance. Thanks. Has the lady already come down? - She went out a while ago. We exchanged rooms. She's in 110 and I'm in 115. - That's fine. I'll note it down. Do you remember what room the man was in? In 115. You're sure? - I am. Did the man in the photo kill someone? No. Can I see the photo again? If it's the man I'm thinking of... the reason he gave for not having his identity card... was that it was at the notary office, for a legal document. He might be lying, but that's what he said. Thanks. I remember him because he paid with a 500 euro note... and I didn't have change. No. I never saw him. Should I show it to the crew? - Is it worth it? If he had money, don't waste your time, inspector. What crime did he commit? Treason, robbery and flight... - Was it political? Most likely, he's already disappeared. What was his name? David Justo. If I learn something, I'll let you know. What do you do on Pico? I milk the cows... Walk... Play the viola... Watch the sea and the sky... I read the book... What book? The Odyssey... By Homer?! It belonged to a professor. He told me it was one of the oldest books... one of the first books ever written... that the man who wrote it was blind. But even if he weren't blind... it wouldn't have helped him... because all around him, all over the world... there were no books yet... neither libraries. I never studied, Marina, I never read a book. You don't exist... David. I forgive you for lying... but our contract continues. More than three months without showing up, out! More than three days here, also out! I know... And if you lie to me again... I'll stick a harpoon down your throat! Sorry. I wanted to cheer up. Shall we have dinner? It smells good! Where did you learn to cook? Nowhere. You were born taught? No. I was a cook. You don't like being asked questions? I like it... It doesn't seem that way! I'm not used to it, Marina. Do you want candles on the table? I do! I showed the photo to the receptionist. What did he say? It could be him! What name did he give? None. He invented an excuse to not identify himself... but he paid in advance with a 500 euro note. What excuse did he invent? That he had left his identity card at the notary office for an act. And you, did you discover anything? No. But I smelled his presence strongly today. He hasn't left here. If he isn't on this island, he's on the other one, across the way. On Pico? Ever since I was little, I could smell the odor of people I lived with... even if they were already dead. Even today I can smell my father's odor on everything he touched. Are you married? Divorced. Do you have children? I had a daughter. She jumped off a bridge. On the first day I saw you, you were crying in your office... listening to a girl's voice on a tape recorder. Was it her voice? The harpoon was my grandfather's and the cape was my grandmother's. It belonged to her grandmother... and was passed down to her mother, my mother and then to me. Whenever I need tenderness and strength... I wear it... It's as if all the women who wore it before me hug me. In the cow stable, there's also a harpoon. In your house? The old man who lived there must have been a whaler... All the old men were, David. These islands have always had lots of widows and orphans. 'The Gods Don't Sleep' was the name of my grandfather's boat. Did you ever see a whale killed? - I did. It was like a building collapsing... or a ship sinking. When I was little... sometimes this bay was a sea of blood. Is your house pretty? - It is... It's isolated, on a mountain... How did you get the money to buy it? I had an inheritance... And you fled from the world? - I fled. Are you going to live the rest of your life in the house... with the cows, the viola and the book? I am. Maybe I'll get some more books... and more cows! Do you want company? Why? So we get to know each other better... You want to sleep with me? I'll see you tomorrow. How many women have you lived with? With one. Only?! Only. How long? A long time. Did you love the woman you lived with a lot? If you lived a long time with her... you must have loved her a lot. Fuck! Fuck! How is everything? Fine. Have you worked here a long time? This year, I finished one of Saturn's small orbits, 7 years. Do you know this man? Are you with the police? I'm on vacation... I don't know him. What did he do? He escaped. - From prison? No... Are you sure you never saw him? Are you sure he was here? How much do I owe you? Four forty. Get out of here! Leave! Get away from me! Good morning... - Good morning... I want to know if a family member, a few weeks ago, signed an act... What act? - I don't know. It's this man. Who are you, Madame? - I'm his relative. His name is David Justo. What act did he sign? - That's what I want to know. I'm sorry, but I can't help you if you don't tell me what you want. And the police, you can't help them either? Are you with the police? IF SOMEONE ASKS FOR ME YOU DON'T KNOW ME DON'T TALK ABOUT PICO I'LL BE BACK 'Death will come and it will have your eyes' I've been locked in here for years... lying in this bed... in this house that I haven't seen in centuries... in this world that I never understood... motionless... like a dried out plant... or a cold stone. End this, boy! End this once and for all! Take the money and flee. Start a new life. Death will come and it will have your eyes... this death that accompanies us... from morning till night... sleepless... deaf... like an old regret, or an absurd vice. Your eyes will be a useless word... a muted cry... a silence. Oh dear hope... that day we too will know... that you are life and you are nothing. Death has a look for everyone. Death will come and it will have your eyes. Money is the tempter and the corrupter of men's hearts... but shame is fatal. It asphyxiates the soul. End this, boy. If it's not you, she'll end it and you won't get the money. Don't be a coward. Take the money and flee. Start a new life in a distant place... where no one knows you. It will be... like ending a vice... like seeing reemerge, a dead face in the mirror... like listening to closed lips. April 25, Freedom day... it's very joyous... love-like, we love this day... Excuse me, inspector. I thought everyone had left. Damn! Did you see his eyes? The guy was crying, but if looks could kill...! Lucas! The cop's name is Lucas. I straightened up the bedroom, put away the clean clothes... and cooked food in the microwave. Do you want it heated up? No. Can I go now? You can. I put the money in your wallet. Thank you... I'll just take a bath. You son of a bitch! I'm calling because someone has committed suicide. The person's name? Jos? Maria del Espirito Santo. No, m'am. I'm not joking with you. Rua dos Her?is da India, n? 2. Yes, Her?is da India. Fine! TRUTH IS A POISON - Khmer Proverb - Maybe this one. What's the name? - Sara Oliveira. No! Sara Oliveira e Silva. Date of birth? November 16, 1998. 1998? - Yes. The date of death? - September 11. Do you want to add a phrase or an inscription? No. It's 10% on signing and the rest at the end. Excuse me! Hello? You've got the right number, I'm the one who wrote that note. I want to speak with you but outside of your work. About someone's death... No, he died fifteen days ago. He killed himself. It was a man who was very sick... And he couldn't kill himself... No, no, he couldn't. That's why I want to speak with you. Can we meet in the dead man's home? Rua dos Her?is da India, n? 2. In Marvila. That's fine. I'll be waiting for you. Did any of you have a suicide in Marvila, two weeks ago? I did. An old man with a degenerative disease who shot himself in the head. He was a university professor, retired, lived alone... Born in Badajoz, came to Portugal after April 25th. His name was Jos? Maria del Espirito Santo. Did he have any family? - No, no one. We spoke with an employee who cared for him for two years... and lived in the basement. She's club-footed. She's the one who found him. Any doubts about the suicide? - None. The coroner confirmed everything, the weapon was his... he fired it. The old guy didn't want to suffer anymore and took a shortcut. Why do you want to know? Who's paying today? I am. See you next week. Bye. Sleep, sleep, my child You take after your father, Lucas. You are very quiet. How many years has he been dead? 14 years, mother... I always think of him, every day. Sometimes, I dream about him. Mother... Your daughter and wife are fine? They are. They send their love. Is it such trouble for them to visit me? It's not that, it hasn't come in handy. Is your daughter a good student? - She is. Does she have a boyfriend? I don't know... Did you bring cookies? They're here, mother. These old ladies eat them all. Keep them on your bedside table... They'll wait until I'm sleeping and go there. I'll keep them in Mr. Adolfo's room. He doesn't like cookies and the old ladies are afraid of him. Do I have to stay here much longer? A little more, mother. The doctors wants to keep an eye on you until you're better. But I am better. Can't I go back home? Not yet, mother. If your father were alive, he wouldn't leave me here... Father could take care of you. I can't. You have to run after thieves! Take good care of your cookies. When I can, I'll bring more. Was that the one you wanted? - It was... thank you. How much do I owe you? Nothing. And for the burial? Also nothing. Was it us? No, Raquel. We weren't to blame. You're sure? Do you want to come by the house for something of hers? No. Did you tell your mother? - No. Is she okay? - She is. Goodbye, Lucas... - Goodbye. How did you get into my office? I clean the offices on your floor. There were other inspectors there. - I liked your name. It's the name of an apostle. Not an apostle, an evangelist. Do you live in this house? I live in the basement, in the maid's room. Who lived here? - The professor lived here. Where did he die? - There, in that bed. And he didn't kill himself? The professor hadn't been able to move his arms for over three months. His sclerosis prevented it. - Three months? 107 days. Did the doctor know this? The professor refused to see doctors for over six months. 193 days. Who saw him? - I did... No one else? Sometimes, my boyfriend helped me care for him. No one else saw him? - No. The professor didn't have a family. In principle, two or three friends would come to see him, university colleagues. When his illness got worse... the professor didn't want to see them and he forbid any visits. He closed the upstairs rooms and came here. These last months, the professor begged me almost every day to kill him. He shouted and cried... offered me money, he spit on me, vomited on me... wet and soiled himself every 5 minutes so I would have to clean him. He insulted me... and said horrible things to me. All so I would kill him. Why didn't you kill him? We shouldn't put ourselves between the life and death of people. I was very close to him. For over two years, I took care of him every day. I liked to wash him, cut his beard... feed him... listen to him recite poetry and tell stories... watch him go to sleep like I would a child. It felt good to come home every day... and help someone who suffered more than us. How long have you worked here? 27 months. 821 days! Who does the house belong to? - The professor. Who does the house go to? - The professor left it to charity. Will you have to leave? In three months. I'll go get some Porto. Who killed the old man? I asked to speak outside your work... because I want to know if you're willing to take the case privately. You want to hire me? I want to make you an offer. You find the person who killed the professor... and I will give you the bag of money that was in the wardrobe. The faster we find the person... the less money he'll take from the bag. Did the old man read all these books? Someone who likes books never manages to read all the books he buys. That was his response. What' s your name? - Maria das Dores. How much money was in the bag? A million and a half euros, 500 more or less. When he knew he had sclerosis... the professor sold all the buildings and land that his parents had left him... and brought the money here to the house. For over two years, I took care of him every day... without ever touching the bag... without ever taking a banknote... except for household expenses and with permission. But I always thought when he died... the money would be mine. It was my retirement. Do you have any idea where your boyfriend went? I didn't say it was him. The taxpayers pay me to be minimally competent. How do I know I can trust you? You can't. I don't trust you either. If the bag is empty, what do I get? Nothing. And that's the risk you run. And you, what do you risk? Spending the rest of my life cleaning others' shit... and chewing over an unpunished betrayal. What's your boyfriend's name? - David Justo. What did he do? - Odd jobs... Did he live off you? Did you speak about this to anyone else? No. Then don't. And also these things. - Fine. Is that all? Yes. Good afternoon. Do you have rooms? - How many? One. For how many nights? - One or two. Your identity card, please... I don't have it. It's at the notary's for an act. Without an identity card, you have to pay upfront... How much? - 30 Euros. Per night. I don't have change for this. I'll pay one night. If I stay two, I'll pay the other tomorrow. Room 115. First floor. Breakfast is from 7 to 10 in the dining room. Is everything okay? Is your trip going well? What trip? You were in the bar a few weeks ago... You're back today... You weren't traveling? I was traveling... - Where to? Around. Don't be afraid. I'm not an informer. I'm only curious. I like travelers. If you don't have better plans... I'll invite you for a drink at my place when the bar closes. I have wine from Pico and French music... Son of a bitch! Here you are! Thank you. Is today's ticket good tomorrow? Either you go today or you lose the ticket. Hello traveler. A drink before leaving? My boat only leaves tomorrow. Is yesterday's invitation still good today? It is. Can I wait here in the bar? - You can. But before you change your mind, I'll give you my keys. It's on Porto Pim, next to the fort, number 66. Help yourself to anything, ignore the mess... and careful with the ferret. For the police, your boyfriend doesn't exist. He doesn't have a criminal record. Did he ever speak about some place he'd like to go? No. Where's he from? - From Alentejo. And you? - The same. Did you ever see him with friends? - Never. And with other women? - Also no. Did he go to a cafe or tavern in your neighborhood? I leave early in the morning and return late at night. I also work on Saturdays. I only saw him at night and on Sundays, and we didn't ask each other questions. How did you meet? On the bus on Christmas Eve. It was raining a lot. He got out after me and walked me to the house under an umbrella. The next day, when I left the house... he was in the street waiting for me, to take me to the bus stop. With an umbrella? - Yes. You didn't see that in a film? I go to the cinema once a year, on my birthday. He never offered to kill the old man and leave with the money? He mentioned it once. I warned him I'd call the police if he ever did it again. Do you accept my offer? No... I'm thinking about it. You don't need money? Not as much as you need revenge. How did you know I worked here? Are you following me? Not yet. Do you have a family? We all do. Created by you? - No. Have you always lived alone? No. And you? Me what? Nothing. Are you leaving tomorrow? I am. - Where to? To where the boat goes. Will you be back? I'll be back. Because of me? Yes. I'll give you the key to the house. If you're gone longer than three months... throw away the key... because I'll have the lock changed. If any time you stay more than three days... I'll do the same thing. Okay? Good afternoon! - Good afternoon! Good afternoon, doctor. - Good afternoon, inspector. Doctor... Did you already ask for vacation? I did. Where are you going? I don't know yet. Why don't you speak with a psychologist? Don't look at me like that. I'm not afraid of you. We're friends. Fuck! Why don't you let us help you? Friends don't meddle in the lives of others without being asked. If you mention it again, our lunches are over. Will you help me with the airport? - Of course! What do you need? I need to know if a guy who disappeared went through there. Do you have a name? - I do. A date? Only the day he disappeared. If he went through there, I can find the date and the destination. Will that do? - That'll do. I apologize for the robe, I wasn't expecting anyone. On the night that the old man died, your boyfriend flew to the Azores. The best place to get a boat and disappear forever. He never spoke about the Azores? No... The Identity Card Archives sent this photo. Is it him? - It is. Where did he go in the Azores? To Faial. The flight ended there. Till now, he hasn't taken another flight. At least under his own identity. What does that mean? That he might have bought an identity card or passport in another name... or disappeared on a boat. Can we go to the Azores? Anyone can if they have money. I have savings. How much? 4800 Euros. I accept your offer. You don't meddle in my work, I won't meddle in your life. Can we leave tomorrow? - No... Only during my vacation. Did you tell me everything you know about your boyfriend? Yes. Can you leave your job without notice? I can. I don't owe anyone anything. You're lucky. 'There are things that kill us more than death.' It was my pleasure. You can count on me. I'm at your disposal. Good luck on your work. - Thanks. He bought a house from an old couple, on Pico. You can rest assured that I won't forget you. If one day I can, I'll help you too. Nothing guarantees us he's there. I know that he's there! I can smell he never left here! Did you ever think of making money from your powers? What powers? I don't have powers. I feel. It's like electricity... You can't see it, but it burns. What are you going to do when you see him? One day, I'll go to his side, but he won't ever return by my side. Wouldn't it be better to let him live without money? Is everything okay? Yes. Yesterday, I nearly ran you over. Have you found your fugitive yet? I'm getting closer. You live in Porto Pim? I do. I've already seen your car parked there. The man we're looking for has also been around there. Porto Pim is a tourist spot. Everyone who visits Faial comes to Peter's and goes to Porto Pim. Why don't you sit down? Thanks, but I'm working. She has been with him! His odor is on her body. Sorry, girls! I forgot about you. Fear is really shitty... Tomorrow, we'll go grazing. Were you waiting for me? - I was. What did he do? He killed an old man who wanted to die and fled with a bag of money. We were together twice. The last time was two nights ago. He told me he'd bought a house with money from an inheritance... and that he wanted to live the rest of his life there. He was here two nights ago? - He was. Did he go back to Pico? - I don't know. Yesterday morning, he suddenly disappeared. Who was the old man who wanted to die? A university professor who couldn't move. Who is the woman with you in the bar? His girlfriend. What are you going to do? - We're going to catch him. She wants revenge. I want the money. God delivers us from disembodied man... alone with his tragedy, in the face of chance and absurdity. Are you going to Pico? - We are. On the first boat. Wait here! Are we going to look for him? It's better to wait. And the money? We'll find it, eventually. If he returns the money, we split it and leave? Not even if he gave me 30 bags of money! You love him that much? I am linked to him with my heart... my soul, my body... my breath and my life. I'm going to milk the cows. There's wine in the cupboard. David, why didn't you tell me about the professor? I told you about his book. - You didn't tell me you killed him. I didn't kill anyone. I helped him to kill himself. He was more dead than alive. And the money? The 'inheritance' you received? The money is mine. The old man gave it to me. I only want to stay here alone. There are things that kill you more than death. Go on, girls. Go on! We're going now! Go! Go! Go on, now! Hello, David. My name is Lucas and I'm a policeman. Did you come to arrest me? - I'm on vacation. Did you come to kill me? I only want the money. The rest isn't my business. Come. If I give you half the money, will you leave me in peace? The woman outside wants more than money. I'm weak, Marina. But I'm not a thief or an assassin. If I'd dreamed that I would meet you... I would have fled earlier. You talk too much. It's over... It's over... It's over... I'm going to milk the cows. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn appeared... they hitched their horses and drove out... through the gateway under the echoing gatehouse. They lashed the horses on and they flew forward nothing loth... presently they came to the corn lands of the open country... and in the course of time completed their journey... so well did their steeds take them. The sun had set... and darkness was over the land.
