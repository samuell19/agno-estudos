And early this morning, local authorities found the body of the son of Colorado Senator Gallagher Kelly, an alleged murderer, Ronan Kelly, in a lake near his home. First believed by protesters to have flood bail early last night. Kelly is now the victim of his own murder case. Local authorities are now looking for these two suspects, Jolene and Andrea Holt, sisters who have a close connection to the Kelly murder case. Looks like we're on the clear. Authorities are also looking for a third sister, Jamie Holt, for questioning. They're unsure if she was involved or not. Local authorities urge if you have any information on the whereabouts of these three individuals, call 9-1-1 immediately. Do not approach them. They are considered to be armed and extremely dangerous. Senator Kelly had this to say in a statement today. This egregious and vicious attack on my family speaks volumes. In this country, you're innocent until proven guilty. This so-called victim did not give my son that opportunity. Instead, they elected to dish out their own brand of justice for a crime of which he was quite obviously innocent. No one leaves this house under any circumstance. You leave, you die. Understand? Hey. Where have you been? Listen, I told you it was going to be like this for a few days. You can't even come out here for me? I really can't. OK. I just need something. I told you it's just going to be like this for a while. Listen, can you do me a favor? Yeah, what's that? Just lay low for a few days, OK? Just hang out, lay low, keep it to yourself. That's all you got to do. Just do it. Lay low? What? Exactly what I said. And I mean it. All right. Yeah. OK. I'll lay low. OK. Bye. Bye. Walking down the hall. Walking down the hall. Tripping and she fell. Tripping and she fell. The remnants from her lunchbox splat against the wall. She don't belong. She don't belong. She don't belong in here. People gather round. People gather round. Prostrate on the ground. Prostrate on the ground. The laughter of her classmates never cease to bring her down. Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa. Early in the morning rise to face the day. Jamie's got a gun she's going to blow them all away. She don't belong. She don't belong. She don't belong in here. She don't belong. She don't belong. She don't belong in here. No, we were... No, I... Take your hands off of me, dude. You're such a bitch. Malcolm. Senator Kelly. No need for money. How are you holding up? I'm fine. It's going to take some time. Cops find anything? No. Did you find him? You didn't show the police this? No. This could help them find them. You know that. I don't want the cops to find them. We both know who wanted to do it. I don't want the cops to find them. I want him to. Sir, listen to me. It wasn't easy, OK? This guy is no joke. He's evil. Pure evil. His cure records are off the charts. I can't tell you what I had to go through to find him. After my shit, I never wanted to see him again. You don't know what you're asking for here. You haven't heard the stories. After I used him, I never felt the same. Something was just wrong. Look, sir, they say he can't be killed. They say he's barely human. They say he's the grim reaper. Good. I want the grim reaper. Easy. OK? My son, Mr. Isaac. He killed my son. OK. Rule one. He is no one. Got it? No one. Open the glove box. He's in there. Caught out about a week ago. He's out on bail waiting for the trial. That's the senator's house. His dad would be a fucking politician. Wouldn't be that heavily guarded? It's nothing that we couldn't handle. So you want to kill him? No. I wasn't there. I hate what he did to you and her. But this is up to you. So you want me to kill him? And we're going to do what exactly? I have a plan. So we just leave our fucking entire lives? Just exit stage left? What does family mean to you, hmm? We are all that we have, OK? Mom's gone, dad's gone now too. Family is something, but it's not everything. Do you have anything else in your life to leave behind? Nothing you're concerned at all about? Just walking away from for something that happened years ago? Right now I'm concerned about our younger sister. Jolene... Don't fucking call me that! Oh, OK. You can't do this, but... She can. I've got a plan. So it's up to her. Of course. Have complete control of your environment. Didn't you already watched that one? I have exhausted every movie that I actually want to watch is on that shelf. Maybe if your sister would let us use the internet. I don't fucking control that. No, I know. Eventually, I'll get bored of rewatching the ones I've seen, and then I'll try the ones I have. And maybe I'll give you a chance to try. Has she gotten up yet? I haven't seen her. Heard the toilet flush a while ago, but I'm not sure who it was. What time? You mean what time? What time did you hear the toilet flush? I don't pay attention. Roughly? Roughly, I don't fucking know. You can be useless. Oh yeah, good morning to you too. I'll keep it for myself. Channel 237. KFYS 95.3. The Ghost. Colorado's home for pop music. We got your news coming up. And after the break, I've got your daily crazy 9-1-1 stories. An addict woman blames a bear for an obvious murder of her boyfriend.

More protests today demanding the removal of Senator Gallagher Kelly for an abuse of power as a governor has sent in our National Guard to help. Senator Kelly stated he had no intentions of stepping down. The manhunt continues for the suspected murderers of Senator Kelly's son, but authorities have no leads. They encourage citizens to call if you have any information. You know there's supposed to be meat in that, right? Yeah, there wasn't any in there. Yeah, I could have sworn I saw some. Don't want to tell you. Oh, well, that's going to suck. Yeah. This place is fucking disgusting. Job, Tell me about it. Did you see the watermelon in the fridge? Watermelon? Yeah, there's a watermelon in there. I don't even know how fucking old it is. Throw it away, Jolene. I don't want to touch it. What if it falls apart? Jolene, I don't have time to deal with that bullshit either. Let me go to the shower. I got you good, didn't I? You OK? Hello? Babe, are you there? Babe? I've been in here a really long time. Got to go. I love you. I'll see you later, I guess. Good morning. Morning. You're up early. I just couldn't sleep. No? No, I was thinking too much. What about? Well, I just feel really bad you being down here all by yourself. Not so? Yeah. You can sleep. You can sleep. Babe? Babe, you there? Is this some kind of fucking joke? It's really not fucking funny. You don't know what I'm going through and I've just missed you. Gone really fucking bad here. Come the fuck on. Call you later, I guess. Joe, are you OK? Yeah, I just slipped and fell. I'm fine. OK, you be careful. We don't need two Lee's around here. What the fuck is this? Keep your fucking voice down. No, you have made us so fucked. OK, well, newsflash. I've been using it since I got here, so clearly not looking for us. Oh, no, they are looking for us. And when they find us, it's going to be because of shit like that. Because you are using shit like that and we're not fucking supposed to. That's it. What? Are you fucking leaving? I sure I am leaving. Where the fuck do you think you're going? I don't know. Do you think you're going to stop me? Well, Lee said we can't leave the safe house because this is where they're not going to find us. This is where we're safe. You can't fucking leave. Fuck Lee. Fuck you. You're being so fucking selfish. You can just tell me. You know this is not just all about you? Fine. Fuck. Fucking go then. Babe, open the door. No, motherfucker. After everything we've been through? You can't even break up to me face to fucking face? You've no idea what I've been through. When you fucking regret this, don't call me. Young man wake in the morning. Cannot find his way back home. Woman cries in the evening. Hides the love inside. Two but they can't be alone. Back and forth they both can go.

I saw somebody out there, Jamie. I saw somebody. You are paranoid. No, I'm not paranoid. There was somebody standing on the sidewalk and they were watching me. I saw... I fucking saw them, Jamie. Let's go tell Lee then. No. No, we don't need to tell Lee. She's going to... She will fucking lose it, right? And then maybe we can leave. No, I did... I don't want to tell Lee because I wanted to talk to you about this first before she freaks out about this. So do what? I didn't fucking see anything. No, maybe you didn't, but I sure as fuck saw them. They were standing there. What are you going to do about him? What do you mean what am I going to do about it? Well, figure out what are you want to do. You are the shot-caller around here. I don't call the shots. But do you think if you didn't we would be here? Well, I would say woke up on the wrong side of the bed, but there is no right side of the fucking floor, Jamie. I'm saying that this is more than an inconvenience. Oh, I'm sorry. Is being here inconvenient for you? Is that your fucking problem with me? That's an understatement. Inconvenient? Truth... You think this is inconvenient? You don't even know what the fuck happened to me. You don't even know why we're fucking here. Do tell Jolene. Oh, so you don't want to back me up? Pretty, shitty sister huh. I have a life too. Oh, I'm so sorry. Then why don't you just go fucking back. Fuck you, Jolene. Fuck you, Jamie. Get the fuck off of me. Fuck. Enough. Can we stop acting so fucking childish?

Whatever. What? Nothing. I mean, Jesus Joe. You didn't even fucking tell me what happened. You just said, uproot your life. Let's fucking go. Joe. What did happen? Julie and I we went to this party. I don't want to go partying at the senator's house, drinking with the son not looking like myself. I don't even go to parties anyway. And... He's not going to get you kicked out. And he's not even going to be there. Oh, how do you know that? I thought I was going to be fine. I mean... You're fine. Oh God. ...Julia likes to go out and I don't. I'm just saying you don't have to be like your sisters. And have you really went? But I thought before I left, maybe I'd give it a shot. All right, who is going to be at the party tonight? I don't know. Just a couple of his friends. Have you met his friends? I have not. Serious? Julia... Do you not want to fucking go? No, I do want to fucking go. Then relax. Come on in. Thank you so much for having us by the way. Thanks. I thought I'd be fine. Hey, dude. What's up? Yeah, now I've just got a couple of girls over. Yeah, man. Just give me a second. Hey, hey, hey, hey, Julia, no. Hey, hey, hey. Julia, Julia, Julia, Julia, it's me. It's Joe. It's Joe. It's Joe. It's Joe. Hey, come on. Sit up. Sit up. Hey, it's me. It's me. It's me. It's me. What the fuck is going on? Hey, hey. You need to calm down. calm down. Come on up. Sit up, sit up, sit up. OK, I'm going to lean up against this, and then I'll bring your hands. We're going to get you out of here, OK. You just need to calm down. You just... look at me. I'm going to get you out of here. But you need to stay quiet. I'm going to need you to help me OK? Please just get me the fuck out of here. Julia, I... Get me the fuck or go to jail. It's going to be OK. You just need to be quiet. I'm going to... we're going to get out of here, OK? I promise we're going to get out of here. Hello. No, it's OK. It's OK. It's OK. It's OK. It's OK. It's OK. Shh. Please, please, please. Shh. It's OK. Please. We were laying there and I had to look into her eyes all night. Yes they're just very lifeless eyes staring at me back on the floor and I couldn't do anything about it. And he had his gun in my back the whole time making me sit there on the ground with him. And part of me just... Part of me just wanted him to take that shot and just so I could stop looking into her fucking eyes there on the ground with me, because I could see her eyes and I couldn't do anything to help her. I just couldn't do anything that can help. And I just wanted him to stop. I just wanted him to stop because I couldn't. I'm so sorry, Joe. How are you doing? I feel a little better honestly, but not really myself. How are you doing? I... I just keep thinking that we're going to get caught. And I keep thinking about Julia. And I keep thinking about the birds. The birds? Right before I pulled the trigger, there were these birds that flew overhead and running, and I both looked at them and it was like we knew that that was the last thing that he was ever going to see. It was. I know, it's just that I feel like something something's wrong. I don't know what it is. Channel 19. Five minutes. And because of this, protesters have succeeded. Senator Kelly will be stepping down effective immediately. So is this what they wanted us to see? No, it's not on yet. And a bit of bizarre news. A former doctor, now on the FBI'S most wanted list for a murder of a patient over five years ago, was found dead last night. His disappearance, labeling the case cold, authorities were baffled to find Dr. Richard Penner murdered stateside in Colorado. There are currently no leads as to who killed Dr. Penner, but investigations are ongoing. When we return... That was... We have to fucking go. No. Yeah, we have to fucking leave. Are you kidding? No, we can't leave. This is our only way out of the country. If we leave, we lose that. We're staying. Lee, they found him and killed him. Yeah, but he had his own hang ups that had absolutely nothing to do with us. We have to stay here. It's the smartest decision to make, so we're going to make it. No one's coming for us. As long as we stay here, we're safe. So that's what we're going to do. OK? Do you remember that one time I went to prom? Yeah, you had a beautiful red dress. Oh, I loved that dress. You looked stunning. I mean, absolutely stunning. And you went with that guy. What was his name? Nick. Wasn't he that guy that died in some weird hunting accident or something? That is what the official story states. But I feel like if we're going to follow through with this, you deserve to know the truth. Well, I was a senior and he was a freshman, and no girls had really paid attention to him yet. And that's why I decided to go with him. After the dance, he drove us out into the middle of nowhere. And I... shit went down and I had absolutely no choice and no way to get home. And I was young. And you remember how pissed dad was, right? Yeah, he was just fucking pissed when you didn't come home that night. But he wasn't pissed for long, was he? Well, I mean, you know dad. He always knew when something was up. And he gave it to me straight. And he said life is like a campsite. Your only purpose, your only mission is to keep the predators away, wolves, coyotes, bears, humans. Keep them away as long as you can, and eventually, they're going to win. But the amount that you take with you is your strength. And that next morning, he drove me out to that same exact spot and I could just tell that if I gave it to him straight and I told him the truth that I wasn't going to be in trouble, and that he would have my back because that's just who dad was. And he drove me out there and I told him everything. I told him the truth. I told him I didn't have a choice. I was scared. He just looked at me and he just said open the glove box. So I opened it. And there was just a gun just sitting in there. And he just looked at me and said, you were there. You know what happened. This is your choice. This is your decision to make. And he only said one more thing, can you live with it? Fuck. Hey, man. Yeah, I'm short. Can you give me some? Good for it. Come on, man. If I drop your location can you meet you there? All right, cool. I'll see you in a minute. So much. There you are. Anytime. Unless I hit you up. OK. Thanks. See you. See you. Having trouble sleeping. You want to go get bagels? I don't know. I'm hungry. So get ready. Best bagels are here. Wasn't this worth the drive. I don't know. Actually I'm going to go Yeah. What? That's so true. I've never been there before. It is a pretty good idea. You can't let me go. I'm stuck in your head then he don't even know. Don't. As you can see, I'm on the better things. Ignore the phone when it rings. You realize what you could have had so that buzzer on just stings. What. She playing scenes, but I'll never trip. I'm going to do my thing and never slip. Middle fingers up to a lion bitch like I know. I know. You're missing me. You're missing me. That new man, that new man, ain't shit I see, ain't shit I see. I know, I know, you can't let me go.

I know, I know, you can't let me go. Don't. I'm stuck in your head and he don't even know. I know. He knows about me. He knows about me. He knows about me. I know, I know, you're missing me, you're missing me. That new man, that new man ain't shit I see, ain't shit I see. I know, I know you can't let me go. I'm stuck in your head and he don't even know. Don't. As you can see, I'm on the better things. Ignore the phone when it rings. You realize you could have had so that buzzer on just stings. What? She playing scenes but I'll never trip. I'm going to do my thing and never slip. Middle little fingers up to a lion bitch like. Nice try, asshole. Shh. I know. I know. I know. I know. Please, You have to be quiet. Shh. Joe. Joe. Hey, hey. Not right now. OK. We need management. Come on. All right, let's go. Come on, Joe, get your shoes on. OK. I'm going to get you out of here. Hurry up, hurry up... I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm trying.

This isn't a fucking game. Get up. Joe, you have to go. No, it's my fault that we're here. It's my fault. Lee I'm not fucking leaving you here. Lee, please get up. You have to go. No. Joe, you have to go. Not without you. I love you, OK? Go. Go. I love you. I love you. Miss Holton. I've been waiting for this call. No one, very good. Understand you hurt my family, Miss Holton. You can't do that and get away with it. It makes me look bad. You have to be made an example. No one will be able to prove this was me, but they'll know and they'll fear. Go ahead and apologize now. I've been waiting for this. Fuck you. Face so pale and white. It's shadowed as the grave. Savage silhouette, drapery sorrow. They beck and call each night. Of a solitary night. Scavenger of rot cooks the marrow. Ravenous and roaring rage. Assume the forest, spite the page. Safe for now, lie in a cage. Evil now will burn in sage. A criminous bent with age, sour smile, the puppet age. Mountain now. Winds of change. Endless now, the war we wage.
