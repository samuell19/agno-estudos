C?TE D' AZUR Seafood and Seashells In my grandma's garden in Holland, I was sure she had a well. I was positive. I could describe it. I saw it so clearly. The bricks, the coping, the bucket, the tulips all around... But no. There was no well. They filled it in? It had never been there. Like your castle. We couldn't see it from the road. We can't see it here. But you imagined it was there. I can see it, Beatrix. The coastline, the rocks, the sea and the castle. Exactly like here. There. Yes, there. The pine trees have grown. In 25 years, they've had time to grow. It's behind the pine trees, Marc. Behind the trees. Stupid asshole! Cut it out! What's going on? Charly's a pain! She's a pain. She's leaving tomorrow... She can sleep somewhere else. He can wait. Hey, we're on vacation! So kindly work this out without screaming! Laura, give Charly the room. Charly can do the dishes tonight. Any comments? Perfect! As my grandma used to say, all's well that ends... ...well. Look at that color... We have to eat stuff like that on the Riviera? You don't have to. It's an opportunity. It's full of iodine. It's healthy. You can't get violets in Paris. It's been years. Maybe it's like your castle. You dreamed it was delicious but it's ordinary. Or even gross. What? It's good. I told you. It reminds you of something? Of course. Anything specific? No, just things... Forgotten sensations. It reminds me I hate raw things. Don't get me started! You're outdoing each other in regression? It's really good. Do we have some lemon or pepper? Pepper, that's it. They need some seasoning. Leave us some hot water! It's crazy how teens today love to scrub. When I came here, I'd forget. That's gross! It's cleaner here. I liked the taste of salty skin. Come on, you're not rationing hot water? It's not just the hot water. When you wash too often, you get skin problems. Everyone knows that. And wasting water like that is bad for the planet. Okay, I get it. From now on, no more showers. You're so excessive. Moderation is all we ask. Dad, what's with the hot water? At the station. It's my dad's fault. The weather is great. Like violets? They're weird. Soft and purple. I mean yellow. You've grown. How long has it been? - A year. Think I've changed? You've... Suddenly I realize Charly has... Come on, Dad. Got nothing better to talk about? I hope you don't live in the shower too. Wow, you've grown! Dad's already said that. If everything's been said, we can sleep easy! You know where the sheets are. Separate rooms? You can have mine. You get the best view. Thanks. I guess you're right. It's safer this way. I'm on the other side of the landing. Do you mind keeping the sheets? I slept in then one night. And I behaved myself. Be right back. Charly's not here? He's moving into his room. His room? What's that about the shower? Nothing. I was jerking off in the shower. They were pissed because I used all the hot water. Your dad told me not to jerk off? No, stupid. He doesn't know I jerk off in the shower. He thinks I spend too long in the shower. Maybe he's smarter than you think. Everyone jerks off in the shower. Really? You too? Sometimes. It's not my favorite spot. I prefer the toilets at school. Want to try? I'll tighten chain. It'I be fine. We're going for a walk. Back for lunch? Of course. Ever think Charly could be gay? Gay? What do you think? I don't know. Where did this come from? Seeing him with Martin, it was like a revelation. Suddenly it all made sense. What? You're crazy. How was it? Freezing Good luck. You'll need it. It's the sea breeze. The water's much colder in Portugal. I'm not going there to swim! First up, Charly's never brought a girl home. Camille. He was in primary school. Second... I don't know. It's so obvious. Martin is his boyfriend. They've had no contact for a year. That's just it. At their age, they only fight for sentimental reasons. Charly plays soccer! Third, and this is the real argument: Charly and Martin are sleeping in separate rooms. Kids never do that, unless they're hiding something. That's totally ridiculous. Relax! It's sunny, this house is divine, Charly's gay. What's the problem? It's easier to take than if I said he wasn't yours. The newspaper says more and more young people have AIDS. What's with you? I read it this morning. Since nobody's talking, I thought I'd bring it up. It's important, right? Not really. You're wrong. AIDS concerns you. Be careful. Your sexuality's fine with me. Be free but protect yourselves. Cut it out. Are you the school nurse? A free rubber with every Band-Aid! 40-year-olds are no example. With their middle-aged lust... So your advice... I can never talk seriously with you two. Martin's more adult. You take precautions, I hope. Marc, leave Martin alone. You're making him uncomfortable. Not at all. Why be uncomfortable? We can talk freely about sex, right? Seriously, Dad, the liberated, caring act is not your style. He was over the top about AIDS. He thinks we sleep together. That bothers you? No, not really. In fact, it's pretty funny. Hopefully, it pisses him off. No, it would be good. Your father's nice. You treat him like a blockhead. He's my dad, that's all. He gets on my nerves. It's not like you think, a "coming out". A what? Coming out of the closet. What closet? It's a poetic image. It means not hiding anymore, revealing your homosexuality. My mother... She cried a little, for form's sake. I think she's really happy. My dad acted like nothing happened. You have rich kid problems! It's weird. It's freezing. It's not normal. It's because of the sea breeze. You get used to it. Don't go on about it! I was heavy-handed, okay. A gay son, a daughter on a sexscapade in Portugal and I can't warn them? - What's a dad for? - You're right. But you were pushing Charly to spill the beans. You made him uncomfortable. If he hasn't told us, he feels the time's not right. Maybe he plans a more theatrical "coming out". A what? Michael's here. Are you ready? Have a coffee before you go. We'll stop on the way. Kiss kiss! That guy's ass... I never noticed he had such a hot ass. What's with women and bikers? He mounts his bike so... You're both ridiculous, not me. You're not ridiculous. Just a real father. It's the first time I've... realized... so clearly. Your daughter sleeps with men. At her age, it's normal. You have to get used to it. It was really awful. So I stopped bringing girls home and I don't talk about them. You're surprised they think you're gay! You're so shy, it's easy to get it wrong. I got sucked in. I'm not the only one. Take Elise, for example. You told her I'm not? I won't let you sleep with her. Come off it! She's so ugly. You have no eye for girls. I think she's cool. Of course she's not... instantly stunning, but... I'm not like you make out. Don't get me wrong. Breasts are important. Flat girls don't turn me on. At the same time, girls with hue breasts are really intimidating. I don't know why. Maybe it's because they're sexier. You listening? Sorry, not really. Breasts don't do it for me. Check out that guy. What about him? Wake up! He's cruising. Give me a break! He's out for a walk, like us. It's the best spot around. Then he's cruising. Fags always choose the best spot. You're not overdoing it a little? Not finished yet? Bikes are the worst. Cars are so much simpler. I'd rather go for a walk too. Do you like it here? Yes, thanks. It's great. Where did you go? We took a path, further up. There are rocks, a nice view. It looks over the sea. Ever been to the fort? Rubbers everywhere. It's gross. But it means safe sex is alive and well. I'll get back to my bike. But you want him to think you're gay? Yeah, but no. No need to lay it on so thick. Don't look so embarrassed when he asks where you went. If he's decided you're gay, he'll see sings everywhere. Forget it. This is insane. How can people think I'm gay? Seriously! You're too cute to be straight. I think it's time you came out. Don't worry so much. Let things happen. My mind's a blank. Liar! You were thinking about Charly. Maybe. It wasn't conscious. Your children's sexuality bothers you. You should stop thinking about it. And stop trying to talk to them about it. Stick to cars? You didn't have a Dutch mother. When we talked about sex, it came naturally. You can't. You get tense. It's not your fault. It's about upbringing, learning to be tolerant. Sometimes I think you're too tolerant. That proves you don't get it. You can't be "too tolerant". Either you are or you're not. I'm telling you, forget it. Listen. "The erect, full-bodied female panicles "contrast with the thin, mangy male panicles." Interesting... Yes, Mathieu. I'm on my bicycle on a delightful little road. And you? What? At the station, of course. Where are you? I'm not angry. Just a little surprised. I can't see you. Do you like violets? A shellfish. They're soft and purple. I mean yellow. Not really yellow. If I understand, you're planning... to spend your vacation here. Let's say, part of it. Here with you. If you want, I can leave. Spare me the blind... devotion. Let's just say I find the situation... a little... tacky. Idon't want to spend my time inventing stratagems to fool Marc. It's degrading, isn't it? What's so different here? At home, Marc deals with his customers. I always have a reason to leave the garage. At home, you fit into my schedule... I'll make sure I fit in. Maybe. But then we'll fall into a routine and vacations are meant to break routines. You want me to leave? Not really. I'm trying to find a way to make you a summer lover. A romantic lover... You have it all wrong. Josette was a very beautiful, intelligent woman. At 70, she still turned men's heads. She had lovers. That's so absurd, you can't imagine. Not as sad as imagining a 101-year-old virgin. She had some crazy ideas but one huge fault. She was stingy. That changes everything. Nothing could be less sexy. So she was a woman... In need of a fuck? Since my grandfather couldn't pay, she shut us out. She even disinherited my grandma. So how come you inherited? My grandparents died ages ago. We were Josette's only family. She changed her will. It was a surprise when she died. It's a sad story really. She ended up here all alone... with her avarice. All alone... She had a nurse? What are you suggesting now? Everyone's had a shower? I'm emptying the tank! I can't hear you. This is no time to call. Wait, the network's better in the garden! You're not going out? It's late, so it must be important. It should get through here. It's getting through. Show you a good time? Okay but make it quick. This is not in my call plan. Who was it? Christiane. What did she tell you? Her life story, again. She's so in love. It's important. To keep you talking for an hour at midnight? It wasn't an hour. Come on! You're freezing. What time is it? Go back to sleep. It's pouring. No big deal. We'll be stuck indoors. It's nice being bored on vacation. On the beach in summer's glare Shellfish, shellfish everywhere So pretty Basking in a bikini Nonchalantly, languidly On the beach fast asleep Shellfish, shellfish, hard to beat With no ado We'll gather one or two Shellfish are so good for you Listening to the same refrain Singing songs with dubious rhymes Spouting nonsense yet again Coming out with dirty lines I'm going to take a shower. At noon? Why not? Unless... How about a jerk off contest? With you? Not with my dad! Listen, Charly. That's fine in the locker rooms after soccer, but don't try it on me, okay? For me, your cock... Your cock, your balls, your ass... Go take a shower! Think of me when you jerk off? Less often now. I'm sorry. Sun's out. Want to get a drink? I'll take the yellow balls. Where does my hand go? I hit any old ball. It's no big deal. You're in school? I'm in senior year, accounting. I passed all my final exams. I'm happy. - Congratulations. I'm a senior too, in literature. I'm waiting for my exam results. I'll hit them both. Maybe one will go in. Try to blast the red one. You were tied up. I'm getting some air. I can't talk louder. I don't know where I am. Listen, get off my case. Take a shower and go to bed. What can I say? I can't come back now. I'll call you back. Shit! Nothing. I'm on my way. I'm drowning my sorrows in pastis. Want one? I'll take a hot shower if I can. Outdoor fucking has its drawbacks. Was it fun? If I were you, I wouldn't push it. You're not answering? I don't feel like it. Get up, lazybones! Stop it! Get lost! Get up, I'm starving. Leave me alone! I can't get up right now. I'm naked. I've seen others. I think you scared him. I'm going for a walk. Want me to come? No, you're reading. Keep reading. Didn't you hear the phone last night? Why didn't you answer? Marc and I had made love. I wanted to sleep. You two still make love? Sometimes. Do you like it? When he's on form. I'm not sure I like it. Relax, it doesn't happen often. But yesterday... Maybe it's the violets. I ate some last night myself. Two dozen. And at lunch? Some whelk. Good. What else? Clams, lobsters and scallops... and winkles. More. Prawns, mussels, cockles and tiny periwinkles. Is that all? Sea urchins, more scallops... and abalone. How sophisticated. What else? Velvet crabs... and scampi and a crab, a big crab, with mayonnaise. Naughty boy. What else? Shrimp, of course. Pink ones and gray ones. With you I feel like a teenager misbehaving. I feel like I'm my daughter's age. Right now, for example, I'd like to stuff myself with sweets or cakes... or chocolate. Tonight at dinner, I wouldn't be hungry. I wouldn't eat and I'd think of you. Why don't you run away? No, I don't want to. Sneaking out, yes, or playing hooky. But not running away. I know it seems weird. It's not a fear of change that's holding me back, or my kids. They don't need me anymore. It's a feeling I have. A feeling of well-being in this unbalanced kind of balance. And I think I love my husband. Where do I fit in? You? You have my cell phone number. You should go for a swim. No, I'm fine. I'm going in. I'm all sweaty. Come with me. I said I don't feel like it. I don't care. I want you to come. I never said you wanted to fuck. You just want to be desired. You're a tease. You're so over the top. You act like I'm some loony. Not loony, just a tease. I ought to know. Want some? It makes you droopy. I like being all droopy. Shit! Fuck it! Why are you all worked up? Charly left the shower running and went out with Martin. So what? They're allowed out. Why the big diversion? I don't know. They didn't want us to know. Well it backfired. It's hardly discreet. A plane! I love planes. People travelling... You never messed up when you were a teenager? Tease! Yeah, sure. I'm the tease? Never seen you here. Because I'm not... From round here. No kidding. I know everyone here... Nearly everyone. Relax, I have what we need. Vanilla. Tempted? Voyeurs everywhere. Come on. You're no wallflower. My name's Didier. What's yours? Marc. Marc. I love that name. Don't be nervous. I'm very gentle, you know. What's your job? Plumber. It turns you on? Come to my place. I have handcuffs. That's old Josette's villa. She was my great aunt. She died this winter at the age of 101. A family record. It's not that far away. I could walk home. Josette was on your dad's side? Right. My mom's not from here. What's your dad's name? Biancheri, Marc Biancheri. You have the same first name? In fact, no... My name's Charly. Did it hurt? I'm really sorry. Don't bother with the naughty boy act. Some people would be pissed off. In the end, it's for the best. I mean it's no big deal, really. Get to bed and quit going to the fort half-naked. Wait, don't run off! You'll love this. You make me sick! Fuck! Asshole! No more hot water! The smell got me out of bed. There's a problem with the hot water. You shouldn't have left it running. I left it on? It's okay. Your dad turned it off. So it's the system. It would have had time to heat up. This time, it's not my fault. Sometimes I could punch you. Marc, what's come over you? Insomnia is no excuse for violence. Scat. Take a cold shower. It's just what you need. Mental case! What did you mean? What? When? With your cold shower? Your son is homosexual, not crazy. I never thought he was. Cold showers are 19th century psychiatry. There's no hot water. Cold water's fine. Hold on. We'll call a plumber. My train's at 10.00. Cut out the martyr routine. I'm naked here. Yes but you're making progress. No erection. If I had even a tiny interest in guys, I would have gone for it. Nobody would have known! But no. When I was there, it never even occurred to me. Not at all. If you'd seen the old noodle between my legs when I felt his big cock against my thing, you'd have come to the same conclusion. Guys are not my thing. I'll have to take your word for it. They're so sweet. Aren't they lucky? I don't see why. They love, they fight, they make up. For them, everything is dramatic. We've lost our spark. And I'm a limp dick? I didn't mean that. And it's not always true. The violets are starting to take effect. What is it? The iodine? It's not the shell. You really need some sleep. No, I'll keep busy. I hate doing nothing. I must have seemed dumb. Sorry, I'm interrupting. I didn't expect visitors. Fixing something? I need to clear weeds. Whatever. I like weeds. Sometimes, I have fits when I get mad. Nothing serious. I wasn't worried. I nearly punched you. I apologize. I fought with Charly and I thought... It happens. You know, it's not what you think. Charly and me... What you do is none of my business. I'm sorry. I thought we could talk. No, in fact we can't. I'm not interested. You teenagers are so annoying! Mess up, it's only normal. But don't come running to us asking... I don't know what! I'm not Dutch, not even half! I'm going for a swim. Try it. It calms the nerves. Shit! What an asshole, what a blockhead! Have you seen Martin? Why would I see him? Okay, you haven't seen him. Yes I have. He's at the beach. Without me? He wanted to be alone. By the way, I called a plumber. Why? For the hot water. What for? Don't complain when I take an initiative. I don't want cold showers all summer. The sea is cold enough. I can't hear you! Can you switch off the motor? Stop interrupting me. Leave the weeds alone. They're pretty. A garden needs upkeep. I'll call you back! I'm going to the beach with the boys! Why did you run off without telling me? I wanted you to meet Didier. I'm sick of your little game. I want you to tell your dad about us. What for? Because it's not funny anymore. Where's the water-heater? We don't need a plumber here. Sorry, it wasn't premeditated, I swear. It just happened, like that. Stop apologizing. It's done now. I shouldn't have come. It was easy to say I was busy. I wanted to see what you looked like. Nothing brilliant. You're still hot. It's what killed me. Strange coincidence my son called you. It's no coincidence. You know Charly? Where did you meet? At the fort. It's not at all what you think. I was glad to see you again. Me too. See you around. I'm not going on vacation. The English and the Parisians always need a pipe fixed. You did love me. Change the subject. It's history. You owe me an explanation. Nobody wrote letters like you. We were perfect. What can I say? I stopped coming here. I was far away. I met Beatrix. She's beautiful. She chose me. And it was easier. I don't understand renouncing love, especially for a life of lies. What do you know about my life? I know married men. Half the fags here are married. It doesn't stop them. Not me. I've never cheated on Beatrix. Bullshit! If we fight, it wasn't worth doing the car breakdown routine. Didn't you go back to California? Yes, to forget you. How did you know? Rumors. You were worried? A little. I was scared, scared you were dead. In 1989 or 1990, there was a TV show about AIDS and suddenly I was scared for you. I came here and I heard you were far away, in good health. I was fine. It's the Promised Land for plumbers! But the U.S. Has changed since I was a kid. In short, you thought I was far awax and you wouldn't see me. I recognized you right off. I have a daughter called Laura. She's gone to Portugal with a biker. Imagine! Anyway, it's not my business. You have to let them grow up. It's not easy. I couldn't imagine not having kids. It wasn't possible. It just wasn't possible. I am happy. You don't look convinced. I look how I look. I know what you look like with me, when we make love. Please, don't be... I'm direct and sincere. I love you, truly. I make love toyou and I know I do it well. I want to live with you. Leave him. I'm sick and tired of being your substitute cock! Don't yell. Sorry. Excuse me. You're right. No need to make a scene. I'll resort to an ultimatum. You have until tomorrow to choose. Then I'll disappear. You can't do that. Who'll stop me? Me. Because I love you. If you love me, then come. Come with me. Why do you have to be so conventional? Can't you be happy like this? We have a nice life, full of joy. I want to live with the woman I love, the woman who makes me horny. I rented a car to act like a tourist. Want a lift home? It couldn't wait till I got home. That's Didier? Shit, you're right. He's hot. I should have believed you. I'll take you to your doorstep. Pull over! Marc's at home. You'll have to tell a great big lie. You'll see it can't go on. Pull over. I have an idea. An answer to everything. That's your problem. All answers and no real questions. I had a flat tire. He drove me home. Invite him in for a drink. He's in a rush. - Thanks. He was a little sleazy. Dom't encourage him. If you want a fuck, go right ahead. What's got into you? It was a joke. Save it for your customers. I'll fix your bike. No, I'll do it. You're busy with the garden. I've changed my mind. It's wrong to want things to be square, clean-cut and orderly. Let nature have its way. That what I've always said. You know that guy? What guy? The plumber. Should I? I don't know. You came here often. It doesn't mean I know all the plumbers. Give me a hand. Pass the lawn trimmer. You'll never get it out. I won't be using it again. Dad, I just wanted to tell you, you know... Martin and I are just friends. I'm not gay. He is, not me. Now what? Congratulations? No, I was just letting you know. So you don't imagine... I wasn't. Live your life and leave me alone! You're not gay? Great! What does it change? What's your problem? Stay off the violets, they wind you up! Can I talk to you? Sure. I wanted to set things straight about Martin. I don't know. I don't have an answer. Happy now? You were saying? - Nothing. Yes, you were! You're totally cracked too! Give up the violets! You think this is good timing? Because i? M very tolerant, immensely tolerant and I want people to be the same with me. That goes for everyone! "Mom this, Beatrix that... Yes and no, yes or no!" Why not yes and no at once? Roll on winter! It's the taste of salt on your skin I miss most, the taste of the sea where we made love... Your taste of shellfish. I love you, I love you, I'll love you forever. My future is with you. We'll stand up to others. Our love is beautiful. It will silence them. I can't take it. I'm going crazy! Let's calm down! Where are you going? I'm getting some air. At midnight? I'm responsable for you. You can't! It's not the first time. But this time I know. I need to go out. Let me go! I'll come too. We can talk. I thought you didn't give a damn about out teen dramas! I don't want to talk now. I want to fuck. Get it? You're underage! My phone's outside, not me. Why are you here? They all went out, leaving the door open, so I came in. It was almost an invitation. They've all gone out? Where did they go? I don't know but let's enjoy it. I came to help you ask yourself real questions, to influence your decision. That's cheating. I kind of know you. I'm staying with the Biancheris. I saw you leave this afternoon. So? Charly's right. You're really hot. Want to kiss me? Why not? What are you doing here? I came to get Martin. Get lost. I don't need this! What if the cops come? I run faster. Get off him! You're jealous. You still taste the same. Tell him I'm straight. No guarantees with your family. What's with you? Your dad stole Didier. I don't get your perverse games! Dad, Didier... What are you talking about? I'm sick of this! Go join him in the bushes! Didier's over there! No use crying. My name's Sylvain. You have to go. They'll come back eventually. So? That would move things along. Marc is sensitive. I don't want to hurt him. Shut up! Is someone there? What are you doing? Drinking pastis? Leave me alone! I'll drink if I want. You didn't add water... Did you fight with Martin again? Come on, Charly. I know it's difficult. Being in love is complicated but you're too young to get worked up like this, My darling. Maybe you don't want to talk now, but you should know that I accept your sexuality. If you need to talk, I'm here. What's with my sexuality? Nothing, like I said. I've spoken to your father. The fact that you're homosexual doesn't change a thing. Not at all... I'm not gay! He's the big fagot! Charly, don't use words like that. Martin is your friend. He's a sweet boy... Are you stupid or what? I'm not talking about Martin. It's your husband. He's out fucking the plumber! My dad is gay. What plumber? That should make things easier. Who is he? Mathieu. I don't believe it! While he bangs in the bushes... - Don't be vulgar! Think you're refined? We do our best. Wait till you're our age to lecture us. Stop drinking. I always wondered what it's like to relive a first love. Now you know. And so do I. You can take them croissants. Sleeping out has its advantages. I won't let you go without a coffee. I know everything. No, that's absurd. Beatrix, I'm a homosexual. No, it's ridiculous. I have a lover too. That won't work. I'm gay. I know everything. I'm a homosexual. Life is complicated. No, that's dumb. Beatrix, I'm gay. No, not like that. Marc, life is not so complicated. I can't, I can't... Marc, life is not so complicated. No, it's not true. I know everything. I love the plumber. Let's go to the sea. You smell of coffee. Charly didn't take it too well. You'll have to talk to him. Teenagers are so conventional. And you? I had a Dutch mom, remember. And there's Mathieu. Secret for secret, you weren't the biggest liar. It doesn't change much. I imposed the lies. No, I accepted them. If you think about it, I'm the weirdest of all because I chose you. I still think it wasn't a bad choice. You're a good husband. You're kind, tender and funny. Not macho, not jealous. You never look at other girls. That's an advantage. The truth is I love you. In a strange way but I love you. I love you too. It won't be easy. With a little imagination. The following summer... We'll take this one. The view's great. I love this room, but it has a single bed. Can you help me bring up the double bed? Right now? Tomorrow is fine. Julie gets here Thursday. Maybe we'll stay a few days. It's not so bad here. Time for a little game. You have to find what's changed in the house. You painted the shutters! That's not it. Not the shutters. It's something less obvious. Freezing! Cold. Warm. Boiling, boiling, boiling! I knew you were a great guy. I'll try it now. All through summer we dance Every night a drunken trance Celebrations get the upper hand Eating shellfish in the sand Cockles, Cockles Clams, clams Abalone, abalone Shrimp, shrimp Winkles, scallops, mussels, sea urchins, crabs Cockles, abalone, winkles, crabs and clams Swept away by the tide Hypnotized by sunshine's spell Promised to a life that's never bland Eating shellfish in the sand Carried along by the tide Caught in summer's spell Letting love take full command Eating shellfish in the sand Subtitles: Heidi Wood Ripped by FIGETO
