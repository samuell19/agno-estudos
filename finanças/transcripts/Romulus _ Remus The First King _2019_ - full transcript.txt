>I A God that can be understood is no God. Tripartite Goddess. Bearer of fruits. Cast your gaze upon the earth, Tripartite Goddess, make the sun rise once more. Tripartite Goddess. Bearer of fruits. Cast your gaze upon the earth, and make the sun rise once more. Tripartite Goddess. Bearer of fruits. Cast your gaze upon the earth, and make the sun rise once more. Run! Run! Remus! Brother! Romulus! Remus! Brother! Hang on to me! Brother! Romulus! Brother! They have taken our animals. We have no land. We are alone. The Gods do not look out for us. Eat. What is the point in eating? We are in Alba. You know what will happen tomorrow. Eat: because it has not happened yet. It is the God. Tripartite Goddess. Oh mother, oh bearer of fruit... May your sacred fire continue to burn for us. Bring the waters of the river to your womb and leave us the life that you gave us. Oh, fire that destroys our enemies protect me and my people. Look at my affliction and say enough. And say enough. Take me. Take me. Hit me. Trust me, hit me. Harder! Again! Mum... Protect your brother... always protect him. May God bless your name. Mother, stay with us. Quick, run quickly. This time the God is coming with us. Brother, bring the God with us. We will no longer be alone. Alba will send the iron knights after us. We cannot stay here. After the double inlet, on the peak, the land is high. Maybe we can cross the river there. But there is no way to get there. There is the forest. No one gets out of the forest alive. It is the land of the Velienses. The forest is cursed. It is infested with spirits. They hide among the trees. We have no choice. Do not do it! If you want to live... Brother... Come on get up, my brother, get up, please. You cannot take him with you. Leave him here, so he can die in peace. My brother is alive. We will not risk our lives to save a dead man. We are safe thanks to them. As long as he can make it... they will come with us. It was not a good idea taking the woman. I promised my brother I would bring the fire with us. Walk ahead. Tie him to me. We cannot stop. Get up, all of you. We will rest for the night and Ieave at dawn. Do you not understand we are dead meat this way? The sooner we get out of here, the sooner we will be safe. You should not be alone in the forest. It will be easier to defend ourselves if we all stick together. How can we defend ourselves? Alba will not follow us in here. This is the land of the Velienses. If we stay here the spirits will catch us. Or the Wolf Heads will slit our throats. Marce, sit down! The spirits will Ieave you in peace if you do not attract them by making noise. It is the same with the Velienses. Is anyone coming with me? Is anyone coming with me? You? Not even you? We cannot go on alone. So drop dead, then. You all drop dead, damn you. I am hungry. Come on. We cannot stop. There is no hope. He asked for it. That man has touched the Vestal. He is cursed now. We cannot bring him with us. Brother? Do not touch him! He carries the curse of the God! We must sacrifice him if we want to survive. This is the will of the Gods. Let me kill him and you will be safe along with us. Nobody wants to hurt you. Come any closer and you are dead. Listen to me! That man has violated the fire. The God will kill us one by one as long as he is alive. We will all die. Kill him! Kill him! You take one more step and I swear that today you will be in the kingdom of the dead. You Will die with him! Remember my eyes. Who else wants to die? Who else wants to die? You serva nt do you want to die? Look at his face. He is me. I am him. I am dving- Am I not? It was the fire... Everything will be all right. I am hungry, Remus. I am hungry and thirsty. I will be back soon. My brother is hungry. Do you also think he is cursed? No one knows the will of the Gods. Protect him Iike I will protect you. You can keep them at bay while I am not here. Before dawn if the Gods wish I will be back. You cannot hunt in the forest alone. Stop! He will not return. Tefarie was right. Let us leave the vestal here. We can flee the curse. Let us do... what has to be done. What if his brother comes back? He will smash our skulls. Dawn is approaching. We must sacrifice the man to the God and leave. Let us try to save ourselves. What are you doing? We should not kill each other. Once we reach the river together, everyone will be free. Listen to me! That man has violated the fire. The God will not let us live as long as he is among us. It is dangerous to go near the fire. That is true. But which of you is going to carry the man? Who will stain themselves with his sacrilegious blood? And you, old man, do you want to go against the Gods and condemn us all to death? Do you want to carry him on your back now that his brother's gone? Go ahead. Come on. Step into the circle. WhY have you lit the fire? The man is cursed by the Gods. Move away. Move away. Move away from him. No one can cross the circle of the sacred fire. Holy is the earth it surrounds. Move. Move and you will be safe. Come. Cross the fire. If you really believe this is your destiny. May the earth cover your tomb with thorns, o Cai, and may your shadow thirst for ever. And may the Manes not sit beside your ashes and the avenger terrify your filthy bones with his hungry dog's cry. May your grave be an old amphora with a broken neck and may everyone pelt that grave with sharpened stones if you blasphemously challenge the fire of the God and may you always be cursed. He has come back! It is incredible. Eat, all of you. This is the heart of the biggest deer of the swamp. It knelt in front of me before dying. With its heart you will run through the mud, you will climb the tallest rocks, and stride across the Tiber by my side, and there we will build a shelter. And we will not be afraid to sleep at night any more. My brother. What are you doing? Healing the wound. She does not want to hurt him. The earth is soft. The fog is rising. It will rain today. Be ready to leave. The Gods are looking kindly on us. Look at me. The fire protected my brother. My brother is alive. I have survived the fury of the Tiber. I have saved you from the death of Alba. I fed you. You are not cursed. You are not alone. We will pass through the heart of the swamp and when the Velienses attack, you must stay together. Behold your king. You are no longer beasts. You are united, you are a group that will soon have its own land. If anyone wants to leave, they should do so now. H anyone wants to chaﬂenge me agaìn do it now! Those who stay and accept this will be my eyes when I am away, my ears while I sleep, my heart if I am attacked in battle. We will be fear. We will be the terror that keeps people awake at night. We will survive today tomorrow until the day we sit down with the Gods. Until the day we sit clown with the Gods. Come, fight! Do not hurt him! You no longer have protection. Your warriors are all dead. What do you want? Show me the shelter that is mine by right. I am the head of this village now. Sort my brother out and let him rest. There was something non-human in your strength. What did you see? I saw something Iike a Iight around you. You are full of signs. And now what do you see? More than a man... Only the God can have me. Are you the God? What is happening? It is the dance for the death of the warriors. Stop. Give it to the king. You know the art of the haruspex? Identical is the order that rules the heavens and the living beings. The fate of the heavens is written in the innards of the living. Two united as one Iike a Ieaf and its spine. Brothers. Among you stands a king. He will found a new empire Iike the world has never known and never will know again in the years to come. The king will be remembered in time, even after his death, as a God. Hordes of men will obey his commands, coming together and protecting each other after having been slaves for so long. However... That is the quadrant of the underworld... Go on. Finish it! I am not afraid of the will of the Gods. Of the two, only one will remain. The leaf will come away from its spine. Iight will shine on one, the other will slip away into eternal darkness. My brother is healing. Of the two, only one will be Ieft. A brother will kill his brother. Only out of that blood will a king be born. That brotherly blood... It will be his strength, and his blessing. This is the Gods' will. Obey the will of the Gods, my king. Come. Do not be afraid. Did you hear? You have kept me with you way beyond death itself. You will be a great king. Do not be afraid, brother. I will be next to you. What if that woman lied? No one can oppose the will of the Gods. Kill me. Kill me, brother. She lied. She is punishing us because we kidnapped her. The God speaks through her. You cannot challenge his will. Then God has abandoned us. King... king... king! King... king... king! My brother is alive! Stop, Remus! Do you not understand? Her God wants to see us all dead. Leave her alone, do not touch the God! What do you know about God, old man? I beg you, God, save us. Silence! I do not decide what I see in the future. My voice is only the breath of the Gods. You want to confuse me! Obey the Gods and you will live in glory. Fight them and you will be destroyed. If obeying the will of the Gods means killing my brother, then I am the only God I recognise. Please do not Ieave me to such a terrible death, kill me instead. Remus! If your God loves you he will save you from the hunger of the beasts. I am my own destiny. And you are the sign of my victory against the Gods. Do not curse me, witch! I am not cursing you, Remus, I am praying for you to save yourself. Go awayg Go awayg No one will touch that body! This is what happens to those who disobey. You are healed. Your king has healed him! What I did was not done in vain. Where is she? She was a witch. What happened to the sacred fire, then? I chose your life. The fire was our only hope. Now we are Ieft with nothing. At least let the women bury him according to their rites. Stop. Stop! No one will touch that body. You will do what I do. Come to your senses. You must not disobey me! Do you understand? You must not disobey me! The days are over when we obeyed the will of the Gods. Enough! Remus. Do not dare! Bow your head before your king! All of you bow your heads! Do as he says. Are you looking for the fire, brother? Here is the fire! Here is your God. Stop, Remus. Did God stop when we were dragged away as prisoners Iike animals? Or when they made us fight each other? Power is built on fear, brother. Men fear the Gods which is why the Gods control them. What about you? Do you not fear the Gods? Look around you. We are alone. Who do you think these slaves fear? What is the name that makes them tremble? Who makes them obey? Remus is that name. I will be the fire. And there will be no God for us to fear. We are together, nothing matters more than this. You really cannot hear the God? Who is it? Who is it? Who is it? What did I do? Run. I see the Gods' plan for us coming to an end. We were all part of it without wanting to be. Me as well. We saved the assassin. What does that mean? Run... Look at the horror your brother Ieft behind. - Where is he? - He Ieft in the morning. It has gone out. I watched it for a Iong time but I see no fire. We will all bury the body together. Without warriors we are no longer protected. We must leave the village and we must have a chief. The fire has chosen you. For thirty years you will feed the fire constantly and should it ever go out your life will end at the same time. The God has chosen you for this great honour. The river is near. Move! The horsemen of Alba. They will get to my brother. Do not go. No one knows what God has in store for him. Leave him to his fate. He has chauenged the Gods tuo much. What he did was my fault. Your brother has killed our fathers, he has stained our land with sacrilege. No one can defeat Alba. They are the strongest. That must be no more. As long as Alba is strong and feared no one will ever be free. NO one. This is our enemy. As children, we shared the same fate as you. What is it, sir? Did you not hear? No, sir. I hear nothing. The vultures are approaching. Soon we will be on the other side. Alba's men! Into the water! Come into the water! Stop! You stop, brother. He is one of my men. And those are my slaves. They are free men now, they are our allies. You owe your life to them. And you owe yours to me. I won them in battle. Who gave you the right to reach an agreement with them? Leave me alone! Lower your weapons and let her go. This is a sacred ground. Says who? I do, Cai. I who brought the fire. Back. Stay back. Let us go. That fire is our downfall, brother. The power is within us. Inside here... there is no God. Do you understand? Do not dare cross this line. Or? What will you do? You want to become king? Come on! Get out! Look at your king! A coward. Brother... Remus. Take me with you. You will live. I will take you with me... and we will be together. You will build a secure city... beyond the river and bury me there. My king... I cannot see anything. I am here. Here is our land, brother. The destiny set out by the Gods is now fulfilled. We will unite with those who no longer have anything, and all the peoples along the Tiber will be part of this alliance. But this city is born from my pain... and from the blood of my brother. At night his soul will knock on your doors, to remind you of the price of the future. And you, Gods, dull my eyes so they will not see what my sword has dune. I wish I died instead. May this fraternal blood that soaks our land become as hard as stone, and may one word be engraved on it, and echo in the head of everyone who dares cross it, attack it or ask for refuge. "Tremble... this is Rome". After the Foundation, Romulus gathered the errants, the poor and the assassins cast away from other cities. He gave them courage and strength, and told them they would no longer have to show mercy to anyone. >I
