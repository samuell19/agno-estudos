This is Muskaan, her best friends are a blank sheet of paper and lots of colors. once she starts, her fingers stops only after a beautiful painting is complete He is a big blast in small packaging, Mradul is Muskaan's younger brother a bundle of unlimited energy, his feet don't touch the ground, his preferred mode of transport is wheels. Zaidaan is so fond of video games, i-pod and internet, that staring at so many screens got him spectacles at such a young age yet he cant get enough of his gadgets, even in the toilet seat.

There is no school in village. Then where did you do your schooling from? The owner of this farmhouse sent me to city, to study in a school Then how come Deepu calculated so fast? There is an old man In the village Bauji. He teaches me, look at my book. There are Some pages missing Yes bauji tore them off Why? Bauji tears off pages of that I have learnt, and asks me questions from that after a month, If I remember everything I get a reward and if I don't, I have to run around the village thrice.

Bauji, They come here to listen to your stories I will tell you stories as well as poetry, But lets have some conversation first. So Robin Hood, tell me, how do you like the village? Nobody roller-skates here! Yes there is the difference between a city and a village. In cities wheels moves children but in villages children moves wheels. Muskaan what do you lie to do? Painting awesome when you spread colours on a white paper it seems there like a indradhanush (in Hindi) in the sky What is that? Indradhanush means Rainbow. It appears sometimes in the sky after rains. Okey... Is it only visible in the village? No little one, it is visible everywhere. The sky is everywhere. it is visible everywhere. The sky is everywhere. But people in the city don't Have time to notice it. Bauji have you even been to a city? Yes I lived in the city for 50 years. I visited metros and foreign countries too. Ok kids, I think we chatted enough today, I need some rest. Lets chat some more tomorrow. Deepu take your friends back to their farm house. Yes Bauji Now go.. DHUNTAARAA DHUNTAARAA DHUNTAARAA DHUNTAARAA Its too much Yeah! Beat him. Take this.. This one two.. Beat him. He's too big, beat him. Mradul, Muskaan Paras, Jassi, Muskaan. Children.. now its time to sleep Barkha didi have you even seen trainbow? Trainbow? Not Trainbow.. Its Rainbow.. Okey..Rainbow.. yes I have Seen in this village only. When I was younger.

Now go to sleep Deepu where are you taking us? There is nothing here We are about to reach I will just show you, See this.. Look there. Wow... Shall we move? Dhuntaaraa Let us have fun.. Let us have fun.. It's small, but where is it. It's DHUNTAARAA. DHUNTAARAA It's DHUNTAARAA. DHUNTAARAA This is an ancient 32 biller shrine, There is a temple of Lord Shiv inside this building Wow, this is beautiful! Shreya didi.. From now onwards this would be our secret hideout! Yes my Roninhood this will be our hideout and we will do Dhuntaaraahere.. lots of fun... Wow.. there is a kingfisher Friends there is no network My mom brought me latest paint brushes Papa told me on phone that he will buy me a new skates Oooo..mother.. My mother.. Oooo.. My mother.. Every body has parents why don't I have, I cannot see then but they live here only, I can meet them only in the dreams, When I try to touch them I wakes up, When somebody says mummy papa, Lots of anxiety arises in my mind, Dhuntaaraa... Dhuntaaraa... The fritters are very cheap. Nanji, hello. Deepu why are you standing there? Shreya didi, what are Mother and Father? People who scold you for everything. Shut up. Naughty, Mom looks after our homework and food, Our father brings us new things But my homework is handled by mom tuition teacher and made prepares my food. Deepu what were your parents like? I don't know. But my aunt says my father took me to local fairs on his shoulders and my mom sang lullabys to put me to sleep. I am feeling hungry..lets go back to farmhouse and have lunch. No lets not go, Its so much fun here. That's true, but aren't you hungry? What about to have lunch here only? Yes didi, Please Ok, then lets have lunch here. Deepu, get your food here itself. Okey didi... What is this, Deepu? Food What kind of food is this? Yesterday's night's leftover chapaties and butter milk Can I have this too? Sure Yummy Eat with this, it will taste even better. Mee too, Didi its really yummy. Why don't you taste it? DHUNTAARAA DHUNTAARAA DHUNTAARAA DHUNTAARAA After a long time I have seen life smiling, After a long time I have seen kids rotating tires. So you're all here! You all look happy. What you did today? Bauji we saw a lot of new kinds of birds. We ate a new dish today. Yesterday's leftover chapaties and butter milk Good.. It was so yummy Bauji And Deepu what about you? I ate salted noodles. Salted noodles? It is called maggi you dummy. But I thought it was salted noodles. You can call it a sweet noodle or a Maggi, it doesn't matter. The only difference is that of packaging. Just like the difference between a city child and a village child. They are all the same at heart. The difference is only in their attire. Now ask me whatever you want to ask. Bauji.. What are parents? Parents mean mother and father. Mother is like earth and father is like sky. Mother keeps her child secure in her lap and a child is safer under the shelter of his father. But this little one told me that parents are the people who scold you for everything. Yes sometimes they have to scold children but both love their children. Whom should the kids love more? Both. For small problems there is mother and for bigger problems there is the father. How come? For example when we are hurt a little we call out to out mother. But if you escape from a major accident we call out to our dad! But you should always remember that in life, anyone can betray your trust, except your own parents. If some parents ever do this betray their children, Even God doesn't forgive them. Bauji have you even seen god? There is a girl in my class who says that there is no God. She says her mom told her. We haven't seen air either but it is presents everywhere. In the same way we may not have seen God but there is God. Inside each one of us. Earth, Nature, there is God in everything. Hello Shanker - Hello sir How are you? I am fine sir And how are the kids? Every one is fine. They play and stay happy. Do they eat properly? When they arrived they just ate eat a cup of noodles. Now they eat everything. Its because of magic of your hands, Shanker! No sir this is the magic of the village Anyway. Take care of the children, I will call again. Okey sir.. bye.. You seem to be quite happy today brother! Sir called from the US to ask about his friends children. I told him they had started eating well and he said it was the magic on my hands! He is right! When the cook prepare something from his heart, the other person can taste it is the food! Well said. But I think they are also eating more because they have been burning calories playing in the village. The more they play more the feel hungry. Children play in the cities also too Playing on the computer stresses the mind. They don't hungry unless they do some physical activity. Well said.. true Take that. And that. Beat him. Take that. Here's some more. Children, stop this, its sleeping time. No didi, please, some more time. Its very late, go to sleep now Please didi, just a few more minutes Not at all, now go to sleep If there is a small tension, a tiny problem, oh mother out of the tongue If there is a big tension, if there is a big problem O..dad ! slips out of tongue Didi.. Bauji told us today that children usually call for their mum when they are in small trouble.. .. and their dad when in deep trouble. Yes, its like we ask mummy for small things and demand expensive things from Papa. Anyways now sleep, I'm very sleepy. What is this deepu? A catapult What will you do of this? Just see this. What a shot. You did it from here itself, lets go there WOW..WOW.. This seems like a pistol of the village Why don't we play Police and thief But how? Its like this - three of us will be Police and two will be thief. Thief will steal valuables and hide them, and the police will surround them And their the fight begins between them! But where will they hide At any hill or any ruins, Deepu is there any place like that? There is one, but nobody is allowed to go there But why? Villagers say there is a ghost there. If anyone approaches that place, scary sounds can be heard, heard and there is a hailstorm of stones! According to science there are no ghost. This is all a superstitions. I don't know all, this that but we are restricted from going there. Lats ask Bauji So this is the matter! Ghost.. the thing is, nobody has ever seen a Ghost and even if we hypothetically believe that there are ghosts, we will don't need to be afraid of them. Then what should we do? Nothing, you mind your business and let them mind theirs don't let them trouble you. But what if we get scared? You stand up to them and face them, bravely. Not just them, you should face life fearlessly, like a strong tree loaded with fruits and flowers. Then people will take our fruits. So let them! Human beings fruits ad flowers are his qualities. And what good ate those qualities if they are not helpful to others? But even then if someone brings down the tree, then what? It you have to fall than spread like seeds, so that another strong tree can stand up from them. There was a tree plantation program in our school. That's very good, it should be done more often. and I say it should not just be restricted to a program. one should make tree plantation a habit. Mother Earth gives us everything air to breath, water, tress and plants and demands nothing from us in return. We should give back to nature. But aren't we too small to give anything back to mother Earth? If you are old enough to pluck leaves of a plant, you are old Enough to give back too. Now onwards remember that if you ever take something from a plant or tree, make sure to plant a tree in return. And your debt to the nature will be cleared. Wow... Wow.. look rainbow Wow Amazing.. - Awesome Superb - Wonderfull Look didi there are so many colors Yes look there is red, yellow and orange And look these is black too.. Where is the black? silly, its looking so beautiful! It was good fun seeing the rainbow It was so colorful Do you know rainbow has seen colors vibgyor What is this? Look at this, v means violet, I mean indigo, b means blue, G means green, y means yellow, o means orange and r means red, so it is called Vibgyor. It means baini-aah-pinala(in Hindi) What? v means violet, I mean indigo, b means blue, G means green, y means yellow, o means orange and r means red, so it is called baini-aah-pinala (in Hindi) Shreya didi who is that man entering that broken house? Mradul I have explained to you not to touch. My binoculars over and over again this is not to touch. This is not a Toy. And that isn't a house, its looking like some old ruin. Where... that place? Have you seen? Here look. This is the ruin where ghosts live! But I was a man with a big big entering that No that's impossible. But I just saw it. Shut up, liar. Don't invent stories I am not lying, swear on James Bond Lets go there and see. Deepu will you guide us? But didi going there is prohibited. We will just take a sneak peek and return, nobody has to know about it! Neither Barkha didi nor Bauji. Okey - Okey Okey lets go then.. Careful... Let's run away. Robin hood, Why did you run from there? I thought there was someone there. Zaidaan I told you there was no one. He was lying, and he also took a wrong oath on James Bond! Robinhood, you did a bad thing I can lie but will never make a false oath on James Boad's name! Muskaan why did you pluck that leaf? Sorry, I forgot about that . Lets all plant a tree in return. In return for one leaf lets us plant five trees. Five times return! We kid five means five times return. Lets go and plant some tress. Dhuntaaraa Things which are normal for others, spread lots of happiness among us, Things which are normal for others, spread lots of happiness among us, There is hidden innocence in every big thing, Being a friend or be a toy, We just forget these things, that we played along with them, happiness is stored in our heart, why do we search for it else where, why do we close our eyes from this truth, happiness is stored in our heart. This Robin-hood spoiled today's plan. The sun is about to set. We could barely even see anything. Lets go there early morning tomorrow. But remember, no one should get wind of it. Dhuntaaraa.. DHUNTAARAA DHUNTAARAA So my little friends, tell me what upto, yesterday. We planted five new saplings That's great, keep it up. Muskaan didi made a mistake of breaking a leaf and so we made up for it by planting saplings. We don't need to go good work sometimes it is don't automatically. The best part is that Muskaan not only understood her mistake but also adapted herself to mother Earth. And for this you will all be rewarded with cold buttermilk Yes Bauji do u have a four door fridge at home I don't have any fridge We have a three door fridge at home Me too, Bauji why don't you have fridge? I don't feel the need for it. I had a small one when I lived in the city. Why small? The bigger the fridge the more you tend to fill it, one ends up eating stale food as a result. But fridge keeps food safe from wastage But we also end up cooking more food because of the fridge. Bauji why are you against science? You have stayed in city, you would understand the importance of these gadgets. I am not against science. I am against the widespread ignorance in the shadow of science. I didn't get you. Let me explain. If we have a small fridge we will put fewer things in to keep fresh. But when we have a bigger fridge and we store larger amounts of cooked food in it, that's wrong... you also need to remember that excessive use of fridge and Air-conditions.. ..in harmful to our environment. Do you understand? A little bit I will explain this another way, we have a pond in the village, which is used for daily water consumption. Every village known how much water there is. So they use it accordingly. and they keep it clean. And what about in cities? City people know only one thing that what time will water be supplied. They don't know or care how much water is available for all, where it is coming from, what condition is it stored in. most tend to forget that water is limited, they waste it. They forget to that water is limited.. ..and its essential for our very survival. We need to conserve water for our own good, not contaminate its sources. We should save water, we have to keep it clean. Because there is no life without water. Did you understand? Got it Bauji. You are saying that science should help us fight a problem, not to create a problem. That is right. What are you thinking about, Shreya? Bauji told us about the village resources and implementation of science. So what do you think? There is one pond in the village that supplies the village of its entire needs. If we educated people on water harvesting and storage, the village will benefit so much from it! That is a wonderful idea. But this is the government work, not ours. No didi, its everybody's work. I know people in the city working with NGOs. I will contact them, so that they can do something for this village. Why just this village, it should be implemented to all village. Have you seen how many old buildings, shrines, monuments are in ruins, with no one to take care of them? Didi we could prepare a proposal for these things to various NGOs. Lets definitely do that. I am with you on this point. Lets do the needful as soon as we return to the city. What is this didi? Whatever this may be, but am sure ghosts don't drink it. Didi look what I found. You finish your biscuit first. We will go there tomorrow night. Why tomorrow? Why not tonight? Because we should be well prepared before we uncover the truth. What preparations? See, whatever we have found today makes it clear that someone actually lives here and its not a ghost, but may be we could find someone in the night! So what? So we have to be well prepared to escape, incase somebody attacks us. It means we are like agent James Bond? You can put it that way! Zaidaan , make a list, we need Deepu's catapult, My binoculars, Madul's poop gun pencil torch... We have secretly arrange all this by tonight make sure no one finds out or our mission will end before it begins Dhuntaataa Everything is ready as per the list, these are itching leaves, to make them busy, We'll tie them up with this rope. here are the marbles to roll on the floor. Each of us should have a torch and walkie talkie. We need Deepu's catapult, my binoculars, Madul's pop guns and some red chilly water. I filled it in my water gun. And I will play scary animal sounds from my I pod Perfect - Dhuntaaraa... Did anyone find out? No, no one did. We have to work like a team, now we will check to go in different different direction and talk on wailky- talky. Okey.. Dhuntaaraa. How is the material big boss? Wonderful. I think this idiot will drink the beer for the entire year. Thank you boss, your service is my satisfaction. Oye. I told to drink English liquor, not attempt to speak English Hello Didi , I think there is someone in the ruins You stay nearby, I'll be there. Robinhood there is someone in the ruins, you better come here I will come in sometime. Its risky at the moment. You idiot just go and check Which animal is approaching us with an application to get killed! Okey boss I just exits and come two minutes. Strange ... there is no one here...

They may have gone to meet Bauji or may be they are with Deepu May be you are right, you go to Bauji's home and I will check with deepu. Where is this idiot, he still hasn't returned? Is he alive or dead? He drank a lot, may have fallen somewhere and slept off. Wait - why have I come here? I think I might be suffering from shot term memory loss, oh, yes where is that idiot. Idiot.. idiot .. are you lying dead somewhere? Idiot .... What happened, did you find them? Deepu is also missing, don't know where they have all gone? We have to call police. Shanker, call their parents immediately, They should be informed too. You are right Bauji. I will just come. Ouch.. what a bad day. What's going on here? Idiot.. where are you? Idiot... Idiot... Ooch. We don't know where the kids have disappeared. Yes.. Yes Bauji is here.. yes, as soon as possible.. Okey... What happened, Shanker? I have informed their parents, they would reach by morning. What about Police..? - Police will be here in an hour 1 hour.. that's a long time. Police station is 50 miles from here. They said they will reach as soon as possible Supari..

Come Deepu.. rope is here.. Tie him up tightly. Tie it hard so that he cant escape You don't run, tight it more, now you shout, tit it more Aaaahhh How did the kids step out? You should have kept an eye on them. Uncle we leave only after putting the kids to bed. Just as we did yesterday. Bauji where are the kids? I had warned you against sending kids out alone. No one wanted to pay attention to me. Hang on, keep some restraint, the police is searching for them. Very easy to say this things had they been your kids you would have known what restraint means. Only we know what we are going thought. Sir please does not say this to Bauji. Bauji loves the kids and the kids love Bauji. Bauji, our kids are missing, only we know what are going through. That's right, we alone know our suffering. You are right. I understand this pain. Because I have been through it. Expect that you all hope to find out your kids, but I can't even keep that hope alive. Where the hell were you all? Didn't you think about your parents even once? Madam don't scold them, infect you should be proud of them. Because of these kids today we could nab three most wanted smugglers. That too, with their illegal goods. Your kids are very brave. Bauji.. - My Deepu.. Thank you, inspector. Thank you very much. Bauji.. Thank you very much, others like you in this village and thanks to these kids.. Everyone should be proud of these kids! If you will excuse me now, I need to return and file my report. Well done my son, God bless you.. come little one, sit on my lap. May you always be happy, healthy Contact your life honestly, make your parents proud, make your country proud. I will miss all of you, you all will miss me too, right? This is Deepu. A friend of all kids from this village. Together they spent their day , what ever they did they did it together. Deepu learned things from them and they learnt from him. Bauji on behalf of us all, please accept my apology. Don't be silly, you are our guest. You are like my son, just like these kids. They are small kids and you are elder once and one doesn't take to heart anything said by kids. Don't go with guilt, go happily. My good wishes are always with these kids.

What happened Next week the government is felicitating these four kids and also the village boy Deepu, in a school function. Wow that's great news! Good morning, welcome to step- by-step school. Today is a special occasion for us. Chief guest Honorable Education minister is with us for a special reason. I am proud to announce that four of our school kid along with a village kid did a brave deed. They caught three most wanted criminals and helped the police and administration. On this special occasion honorable education minister is here with us to give them a bravery award. I would like to invite Bauji who has come form village and also request honorable education minister to kindly come on stage and share their thoughts with us. Giving lecture and advise is always easy. Its following that advise which is the tough part. Advise is of use only if the other person understands and uses it. we have all been told that honesty is best policy. But how many people actually follow it? How many people are really truthful around us? What I said is of not as important. What was significant was that these kids adapted their behavior after my advise. A child heart is like a blank sheet of paper and we as parents, end up writing certain things on it, sometimes unknowingly, sometimes intentionally. Ghost, darkness, fear.. we introduce them to these concepts. They learn every things from us. we are the only responsible for a kids act. many parents say "I don't know where he is learning all this from?". these are parents who don't spend enough time with their kids. Or parents, who do have the time but not the right principles to inculcate into the child's mind. I request all you to let kids be kids. Nature itself will groom them. This is all that I request you. Thank you. Although I am supposed to be the Education Minister but believe me , today I have imbibed true education. I didn't that education could be this spontaneous and simple. I think that if development is reaching villages late, may be we can get the village to the city. Our objective is no culturally unite the cities with the villages. To achieve this I am announcing that we will include the practical and simple teaching methods of the village schools into our current curriculum. I would recommend that this school accepts the village boy Deepu as its new student and the state will sponsor his education. Your parents have told me that all you four have been unhappy since leaving Deepu behind at the village. Don't worry. You are kid-5 and you will remain kid-5. what do you say? The children who shows this unprecedented courage are shreya from grade 7, Zaidaan from grade - 4, Muskaan from grade from- 4 and Mradul form grade- 2. apart from this there is no kid from the village whose name is Deepak or you can say Deepu. DHUNTAARAA If there's some tension. Or any small problem. That's when we say "Oh my". If there's a big tension. Or a bigger problem. Then we say "Oh my, God". That's a good excuse for not taking me anywhere. Fine. Tea. Give me tea. It's nothing. This is sir's phone which stops working on its own. You have never seen a ghost. And if ghosts really exists.. Isn't that right. Wow...bravo. You've done a splendid job. How did that kid go there? Chuni Mitthi have a piggy bank. It teaches people to save money. Chuni Mitthi have a piggy bank. It teaches people to save money. It's the ATM Where cash is always in demand. Mummy scolded papa, and papa said sorry. If there's some tension. Or any small problem. That's when we say "Oh my". That's when we say "Oh my". Chunni's anger is like 20/20. She quickly finishes off everything. Chunni's anger is like 20/20. She quickly finishes off everything. And papa's anger is like test match. It takes a lot of time. How do we cajole them, make their mood better? We can always see the love between them. If there's some tension. Or any small problem. That's when we say "Oh my". That's when we say "Oh my". That's when we say "Oh my, God." That's when we say "Oh my, God."
