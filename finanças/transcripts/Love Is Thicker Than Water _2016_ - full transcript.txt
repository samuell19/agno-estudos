Uh, yeah, when I was a kid, I thought it was the best place in the world. Everyone loves where they grew up. Oh, I didn't particularly care for Washington. Oh, you grew up in America, did you? Uh, a few years, yes. My father was in the Foreign Office. Go on, tell him the White House story. Yeah, tell him about Jackie Kennedy. I played hide and seek with the Kennedy kids in the Oval Office. Jackie tried to convert her to Catholicism. Thank God that didn't work. What does your father do? Oh, he worked in the steel works his whole life. He's retired now, but started a business, fixing appliances. Oh, that's fantastically, yeah, interesting. And you? Uh... I'm a bike courier, at the moment, uh... raising money to study economics here in London. Oh, so you wanna become an accountant? No, no, if I study economics, then I've got a shot at management back in the works. A management position, huh? Your parents must be, uh, very proud. Oh, let me help you with that. No, no, no.

It's her defense. - She's weird. - She's had a tough time. Her mother survived a concentration camp. She's a violinist. And was forced to play at the entrance of the gas chambers while people were herded in. And she knew what happened in there, so she tried to play as best she could, hoping people would die better if they just had a little Mozart or Bach. Try raising a normal family after that. Jesus, Vida, I'm sorry. I-- No, no, no. My grandmother never ever talked about it. After the liberation, she came here, met my grandfather. And she became a celebrated violinist, and my grandfather became ambassador to Portugal, and then to America. And my mother sensed her mother's grief. And so she made everybody laugh with her weird black humor. Wow. I mean, yeah. Wow. The only thing my family's ever done is work in the steel works. Nothing wrong with that. Only thing they care about is rugby, beer and three minutes of sex before midnight. Yeah. Those are the men. What about the women? Uh, five minutes? Very good. Oh, my God. Look at that Hoover.

Like all Jewish shrinks, Adam, he's afraid of blood. But, this one managed to fall in love with a Zionist, the bloodiest chicks there in London. Well done, Adam. I've been engaged for four years. - Oh, wow. - I've been married for six years to an Irish guy. I was working in the... team and he arranged... Life is beautiful. The sun shines even when it rains. He wanted us both fired. And he's sober ever since. He still drinks, but I love him. And now we live back in Ireland, so... You seeing anyone, Helen? Oh, no, I hate men. There's always women.

So, Vida, be who you are. He had a girlfriend, but they broke up, oh, ages ago now. He was thrown out of the Army. A group of them were caught beating up a guy who'd just come out as gay. But, it was a misunderstanding. 'Cause what looked like a normal fight then turned into this big drama. Like it was big gay bashing. Everyone deserves a fair chance. But if you're different, people don't give you a shot. Pick your shot, Arthur. Have you been to London before? Never. How long is the train journey actually? Good health. Cheers.

She said no because George likes to do it at home. And I said, what, do what? Thinking, you know, what, put up shelves or something? And she said, "He likes to do it at home." I don't care about tradition. Why should I? So I can ask my parents and my grandparents their history, isn't it? Oh! That's a disgusting idea. Oh, my God! What's so funny? "My husband likes to do it at home." Helen! Are you making fun of Arthur's family? If you marry this guy, we have to marry his family. - Come on. - Oh! Vida, that pink is really a winner.

Put him down. Oh, my God. - Okay? - Yes. Yeah, yeah. - Are you all right? - Oh, my gosh. One. Two. Turn it. That's it. Keep going. Keep going. - Okay. I got it on me. Okay. - Are you all right? - Yeah. As you were. It's not like he's gonna fall out. Maybe if you, like, could grab the end here. All right, yeah? Yeah, like push it. You're gonna drop it! I sprained my hand on the coffin! Dad, it's okay. We'll get you out of there in a minute. Oh, my God! It's okay, see? Just hang tight. - Man! We're gonna get you there in time, Dad. Do you think he's slid down? - Down to earth. - Dug the bottom there. Jesus! No, I can't think for the rest of my days, my dad's still slouched at the bottom of the coffin, all tangled up. It's not exactly peaceful for eternal rest. But it won't be fair, though. The worms will get to him well before. Yeah, you wouldn't say that if he was your real dad, would you? Could we like, try taking him out the window? Llion, you-- Llion-- What are you-- What are you doing there? Oh, my God! Look at that. Solving the problem by all working together. George would be so proud. ♪I woke up And he was screaming♪ ♪I'd left him dreaming ♪I roll over And shake him tightly♪ ♪And whisper ♪If they want you, oh, they're ♪Gonna have to fight me Your mum says that she hasn't shed a tear yet. She says that your dad's death was a relief. That he hasn't been the same since Ron died. If she says so. What happened to her first husband? He died also? Have no idea. Mum refuses to tell anyone. Llion doesn't even know. You know what I want you to do? Just run into the ocean and catch a fish and cook it. - Do it right here on the sand. - Please, Vida. Not now. Yeah, now. There aren't any fish there, not near the steel works. Fish get lost, too. Damn it, there could be a shock. We could have food for a week. Look, if you're hungry, I'll make you some food when we get home. That's the first time you called my flat home. If we stay together, we should find a new place, you know. Somewhere that belongs to both of us What'd you mean "if"? Oh, come on, Vida. It's just a manner of speaking. Where were you at my mother's funeral? I had to be here for my family. So why the fuck am I here? You can't blame me that your mum died the same night as my dad. I wanna find a nice corner to drive into without turning. Wrap my car around a lamppost. Vida, people die. It's sad, but it's part of life. It-- Look. Perhaps, you should just focus on how lucky we are, compared to most people. What, like kids in Africa or in Gaza? Prick! Why don't we just stare at the stars and contemplate our cosmic insignificance? You know, you're a fucking spoilt brat! Say that again. When you swear, it doesn't suit you. It sounds like a cow farting. When have you heard a cow fart? I haven't? Why, I've never heard you fart either, Arthur Davies. Do you ever actually care? Do you ever show any passion? Look, Vida, I am who I am. No discounts, no guarantees. If you don't like it, you can just fuck off. Will you do something? Just pick me up and throw me in the sea. Just, fuck me. Or drown me. Or... - I wanna jump on your shoulder. - No. - Pick me up onto your shoulder. - No, Vida, not now. Not-- - Pick me up! - No. Jesus. - Pick me up! - Look, I'm not in the mood for playing games! No, it's not a game, okay? I'm gonna fall backwards and you have to catch me. Are you fucking insane? Jesus! Fucking hell! I have to stay here. - Vida. - Oh, I'm not deaf. Well? What the fuck do you want me to say? I have to stay here, for my family, for my mum. Will you wait? No, I won't fucking wait. It's not the war. If you stay here, we're done. But we, you know, we could-- We could get married, for real. We could, you know, we could live here. I'm 24. What the fuck do you think I wanna marry someone in Port Talbot for? You get your grand management job at the Works. You go down the pub every Saturday night, get pissed with your mates. I don't want that in my life! Are you crazy? That's, that's worth £600. - I don't care. - Oh, yeah, right. Yeah. Yeah. Of course. Right. 'Cause daddy'll just buy you a new one. Bastard! You rot in hell, Arthur Davies! This is yours, Llion. Emily. What are they? Cufflinks. I don't need cuff links. Tim doesn't wear shirts. Your dad made them himself. He wore them to our wedding. I would like Adam to have my silver teething ring. You know, why don't you keep on to the ring? Um, we'll give it to the first grandchild, no matter who spawns it. Not sure I'll be springing anytime soon. This is for you, Brenda. Oh, look, is the roof uneven? It was your dad's dearest possession. What am I supposed to do with it? Hang it on the wall like a flower pot? Look, I need money for my nail salon. I would like Helen to get my jewelry. What do I do with it? Arthur inherits the repair business. But that's worth something! - I'll swap you the tuba. You're so ungrateful! You should be ashamed of yourselves! I didn't know Mushki wrote music. No, she was passionate about it. She didn't think she was good enough, so she, she gave it up when she had you three. I should never have allowed that to happen. And who wants this? Isn't it funny that Ron was the only one who had red hair? She wanted me to make sure you got some of her money in equal shares as soon as possible. After taxes and legal fees, it'll be about £500,000 each. I could pay off Ingrid. Did I miss something? Uh... I canceled the wedding. And now she's demanding cash as if we're divorcing. She says it was a common-law marriage. And her expenses to cover. Hey, you can buy Arthur back, am I right, Vida? He's happy in Wales. Do you wanna have it? No, Mum. It belongs to you. You keep it. No, I'd... I'd rather remember Ron just in my mind. If no one wants it... Fuck, your wee lad stinks! Poor Germans. How can they stand the smell? - Stop it! - Watch the flame! Stop it, both of you! ♪I'll need you ♪Tell me when I say for you to stop♪ ♪First kiss... I'm... of them♪ ♪Lay me down ♪Lay me down The, um, server in the supermarket's playing up. Could you come and take a look? Yeah, you know I'm not a computer expert, Anwyn. You're good enough for me. You're an accountant. You should... Saturday. Mm. He's a 27 year old bald accountant. Hello, Mrs. Davies. I was just in the neighborhood. I thought I'd, um, say hello. Have you got patients in Port Talbot? - May I come in? - Oh. Thank you. Ah. What a lovely house. You been here long? Ever since George and I got married. Feels like a real home. Oh, Council owns it, not us. No rent, though. Ah, the famous tuba. George and I had a good laugh about his, uh, his favorite march. George laughing with a stranger? That'd be a first. How is Vida? Oh, I don't see her so much these days. Um, just on Fridays for dinner, yeah. They grow up so fast, don't they? Actually, her sister's just gone off to Israel, a few weeks ago. She, um, she wants to be a jet pilot, she's decided. And save the homeland. She was always the one who hated Jewish tradition. - Biscuit? - Oh, thank you. - Can I ask you something? - Mm. Your medical opinion. After Ron died, George lived in his own ill world, really. Wasn't much of a father, anymore. Chased Emily to Ireland. And Arthur to London. Is it possible for children to inherit... Why, is Arthur depressed? I meant Ron. Well, I thought Ron had a heart condition. Oh, there was never an autopsy. I see. We're having a memorial service for Ethel. Would you like to join us? Make it a joint memorial for George at the same time. They hardly knew each other. Yeah, I know, but, um, well, the fate of our families seem somewhat connected. Will be so different, though, uh. We're not even Jewish. We don't differ in our grief. Oh, it's very kind of you. But none of our lot wanna spend the money on a train ticket. Why don't I organize a coach? For your group, and... I'll cover the costs of the memorial, of course, huh? Why are you offering this? It's from the Royal Academy of Arts. You, you opened my letter? No, Vida did. She's admitted some of your... your animated portraits? I didn't ask her to do that. But she did. And they really liked them. They've offered you a place. Well, it was her gift to you. And now I'm giving it back as my present to her. All right. Vida. The doctor says I'm probably gonna be blind for the rest of my life. And then, and there's, look, so many broken bones, doctors lost count. But the worst part is... Beyond wounded. Beyond repair. Beyond love. Only good for cat food, now. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty. Even the cat doesn't want my heart now. How are you? Yes, uh, fine, thanks. Keeping myself busy. Help my mother. It was nice to see your father. He looks as if he's healed well. Yeah. Thanks for fixing the camera. You're not gonna say sorry first for beating me half to death? You deserved it. Such conviction. That's the girl that stole my heart. Are you gonna go see the Royal Academy? I live in Port Talbot now. What? And you're happy to die in Port Talbot? Happiness has nothing to do with where you work or where you live. Of course it does, Arthur. It can. You soak in the people that you choose to spend your life with. Ow! Uh, Mrs. Davies, Sara. and I would like to thank you all very much for attending this memorial. And we hope that you'll cherish your own memories of Ethel and George. Thank you very much. You never-- Oh, what are you doing? Uh? I'm drinking again, you know. Me and Jim get on far better when we drink. Trust me. Thank you, Dad, for getting us back together. Cheers. You look good, Vida. You know, it's the first time you said that. Then I'm an idiot. It's always the first thing I think. Whenever I see you, bloody hell, she's lush. Do you get the feeling we're being watched? Yeah, I think they're taking bets. First, kiss. First, slap. Should we give them something? A little taster? What should we do? Kiss or slap? Why you whispering? Because it's an old, forgotten by-law that if you meet your ex at a memorial, then you have to whisper. Oh. Is it the same law book that describes our shotgun marriage? - Exactly. - Got it. Yeah. It also says that the accountant doesn't have to clean up the peanut butter. It's good to see you laugh. I hear you're a hit on the Internet. Bloody howler. Just, don't know how that happened. Didn't even put the videos up, did you? - What, no. Me? - You should get a percentage. You have to say it first. She hadn't been very nice to me for a very long time. I suppose you still remember the Ethel from the early years. Oh. yeah, we used to talk and talk about poetry and painting. She had a lot to say about architecture as well, and... and then we had our first child. It was such a joy, I mean. Yeah, but I think three became bit of a burden, really. Why did you... Oh, have three? Um, well, both our families' been wiped out, most of them, so... maybe felt it was our duty. But duty is the noose of joy. Was that from a poet? What was the last thing George said to you? "Don't forget my socks." Yeah, he had cold feet. He's wearing them now. Sounds like the two of you were blessed. I never loved him deeply. I was smitten by Llion's dad. I loved with a young and great passion. I do miss George. He treated me well. With respect. I was always his number one. Mm-hmm. Not just number one anymore. Um, how was your audition for the, for the Philharmonic? I blew it. Did you? Yeah. Yeah I think that... some people are musicians because they can be, and some who are musicians because they really should be. And, I can be, but, music was always my mum's thing. I've decided to re-train, as a doctor. - Really? - A GP, yeah. - Warts and blisters and oozing pus. - Helping people. Young and old. Rich and poor. Um... Look, I'm sorry. Sorry for what? Everything I did that was wrong. Like what? It's, uh, it's... it's just, it's a blank apology check. You can just, you can fill in the blanks. Blank apology's an empty apology. I think we're walking out of each other's lives. Um, I wanna kiss you. A goodbye kiss? No. Like a kiss. A kiss kiss. Start with a hug. Did your father really start to sing out of the blue at the pub? That's just the Welsh. That's what we do after a couple of pints. And how is life down at the works? How was the everlasting engagement? Well, Mushki's death liberated me. I came out. I'm gay. Always have been, always will be. Now, I can be. Fuck. Fuck, fuck. Are you okay? Oh yeah. Yeah, I'm just, not quite used to the booze, yet, you know? I'm not gonna be sick. I'm okay. Sorry. You must really, really love your Jim. Oh, well, you know. When we're in bed on a Sunday morning, and I look down at him, and he's so sweaty, and snoring his head off, and he stinks, you know. I can taste almost, you know, taste the booze on his breath, I hate it. But I kinda know it, you know, makes me feel safe, you know. Sounds a bit silly, I know. Do you feel like that with Arthur? We haven't known each other long enough to feel that kind of intimacy. That's bollocks. Huh? - Oh, no. - Please. It's all about sex. Uh, excuse me? Well, do you shag a lot, and does he make you cum? Okay. I am not gonna talk about my sex life with your brother! Better hurry up, brother. Bus is leaving in ten minutes. Look at you in your uniform. Hey, I bet the girls love that! - Hey. - Bet some of the boys do, too. Oh! Oh, I adore Army humor. Especially from such a good looking guy. - You coming on to me? - Yeah, what if I did? You know, you've got a very nice ass. - All right, time to go. He's got a wonderful ass. Very, very sexy. You know that the price of cucumbers has just gone up. - Fuck you. - See, don't worry yourself. I don't like black dick. Disgusting! You gotta watch yourself! Didn't he get thrown out of the Army for gay-bashing? Allegations never proven! Ooh, his nostrils are steaming. - Shut up! - Jew boy. You've gotta say Jew boy! Shut up, fucking faggot Jew boy! Yeah! Now you each take a turn and fuck the guy as well, just to teach him a lesson. All right, Llion, Llion. Drop it. Stop it. Adam, fuck off. - You know what, I know your type. - Oh? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It starts with killing a pet hamster, maybe a pigeon or two, and then you got your hand in your mum's purse, you beat up your little brother and sister. Did you experiment with them and lock them in a closet? All because you're angry at your runaway father? - What the-- - okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. That's highly unprofessional. I should only say those things if I get paid for it. yeah, no one would pay for that bullshit. Oh, says the poor artist, animator of other people's misery. Too gutless to face your own demons. Gold medal winner of run away faster than the speed of light. What, Vida not good enough for you anymore, huh? You're fucking dead! If I didn't fake it, I'd never get any sleep. - Honestly. - What about blowjobs then? Oh, come on. Jim isn't that big anyway. He hardly touches my tonsils. Sometimes, sometimes, I use my hand as like, a buffer - like, in case he starts to push. - Uh huh. No, right, listen, what you wanna do is close your mouth a little bit and let it scrape against your teeth. - Ouch. - Scares the shit out of any man. Backs off. - Yeah. - You wouldn't bite my brother's cock off, would you? What? No. What, is she serious? - Adam? - Adam? Oh, my God, Adam, are you okay? Yeah, I've got a cut, I'm fine. Fine. Adam what happened? - We need Dad. We need Dad. - I slipped, I slipped. I sipped. How could you slip? Who's done this to you? Someone-- Someone's done this to him. Who's done this to him? What are you suggesting? Oh, I'm sorry, but obviously, it wasn't Santa Claus, was it? You know who did this, it was your brother. Arthur, say something, come on. Well, look until we hear Llion's side of the story, you can't just accuse him. Thank you very much for ruining my mother's memorial. It's our father's memorial as well, princess. All right, the bus is on its way. Come on. Yes, the bus which our father paid for. Oh, my gosh. Put some water on that. Did you do it? What do you think? Did kill some of Ron's pigeons.
