Come on, Red. Giddyup. Giddyup, come on. Ride 'em, cowboy. Let's get those outlaws. We're almost there. Come on! Got it. We got it. We're almost there. Come on. Hey, Boyd. How long were you out in the corn? Not all night again, I hope. I don't want you to cry anymore, Eden. Don't worry, Eden. Nothing ever really dies in the corn. Boyd! Damn it. Where the hell you been? Boyd... Boyd, no! All units be advised, there is a hostage situation at the Rylstone Children's Home. The local sheriff and his farmer buddies have used some kind of animal sedative gas to try and solve it. By all reports, it sounds like a total disaster. Yeah, I'm here now. These idiots are literally pumping halothane in to try to take this kid down. Well, there goes my reelection. The only silver lining is that goddamn space cadet in there. That little runt was wandering around the corn for four days before anybody realized she wasn't one of the casualties from the goddamn gas. Pastor, try and find out if that boy said anything that would explain why he snapped and killed all those people. So... I guess it follows that, uh, you'll need a place to live after all this, huh? Who knows? If you're a good girl, then maybe we could manage it for you to come and live with me. I have a stable with a couple of old nags in it. You can pick one out and ride it. How's that sound? God dang it! This one piece is driving me nuts! Oh. There she is. The Red Queen. You like the Red Queen? The Red Queen makes the world the way she wants it to be. E-Eden, I'm -- I'm really sorry about what happened to all your little friends in the home. I really am. It was an unfortunate accident. I-I have to ask you -- That boy, did he say anything? No. Not really. Oh, uh, except just to say he was sorry. Sorry? Sorry for killing every adult in the facility? No. I think he was sorry for not killing all of you. Hey! Get back! Hey, what's wrong with you?! That should be public! Cool. Look at this stuff. How many times did I try and warn them? The stuff that they put into this ground without even barely reading a label. Ever notice how the words "maize" and "maze" -- like a corn maize and a puzzle -- are the same? A maze of maize. Weird, huh? Sure. "Amazing." Har-dee-har. Bite me. Hey! Toxins grow on the stalks and leaves of rotting crops. It's a fungus. It can make you sick or even die. Yeah. And, uh, hallucinations. -Whatever you say, Bo. -What? It's true. You know, some people say it was responsible for the Salem witch trials. Fun talking to you too, sis. Ahh! Mmm! Smell those toxins. Velvety and delicious. -So good. -Ceece, stop. Think I'll have a second helping. Cut it out. Stop playing with that stuff, okay? Now, listen to me. I... That's not why I brought you out here, okay? This is. I literally haven't been able to sleep for a month because I... Here. I leave next week. Look, it's an undergraduate degree in microbiology. All right? It's not an eternity. It is. It is! Why would you ever come back? I know you hate it here. Because. Because of you. Because of Dad. And look, Ceece, you know, you'll leave here one day too. With my cruddy grades? I'll be stuck here forever. In this creepy, dying place. No. Rylstone's not dying. It's been a hard couple years. You know? A lot of mistakes have been made. A lot of shitty, shitty decisions. But with -- with a little time and care, then all this... ...it can be fixed. Yeah. Sounds awesome, Bo. Eden! God, you scared the shit out of us. Seriously. What's with the wig? Today I am the Red Queen. Crud. Um, speaking of which let's go. Come on, Red! Giddyup, come on. Cecil, you're not gonna want to miss this. Wally Thomas Pratt! "For the crime of cruel and unusual treatment of your very own hunting dog, you are hereby sentenced to die!" You killed Gibber! Hey! I know this is for play and all, but that wasn't my fault. I didn't give Gibber that poison. He ate it out of some rat trap. And you just watched him suffer! He was just an old hound dog. - Liar! - Billy Barnes! Dog killer! Hey, Wally. Screw you, Barnes. Off the edge, Wally! ♪ Walk the plank, walk the plank ♪ ♪ Walk the plank, Wally Thomas Pratt ♪ ♪ Walk the plank, walk the plank ♪ ♪ Walk the plank, Wally Thomas Pratt ♪ Ow! Jeez! Dang it, Billy, quit jabbing me with that thing! Quit stalling! Off the end! Off the end! Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! Do what they say! Jump! Come on! Hey! What the hell are you doing? Hey, Calder. What in frick's name are you doing on my grandma's car? Cam? Get off. Get the hell off. Are you effing crazy? You dumbass idiots. You've dented the quarter panels. You cracked the window. Damn. You've even busted the gas tank. Wait, Calder, this is your car? Yeah. My grandma's. '66 Olds. So why is it parked out here in the middle of nowhere? How about mind your business, derp? I want to park my grandma's car in my dad's field, I will, okay? What the hell are you doing out here anyway? We're executing Wally Pratt. He let Gibber die a long and painful death. Gibber? No way. I loved Gibber. Screw that. Off the edge with his punk ass. Yeah! Now, quit stalling! Off the edge! -Yeah! -Off the edge! Jump! Dang it, Billy! Archie, get ready to light up that corn when he lands in it. Whoa! Wait. You can't do that. With that car leaking gas and the grain dust in the air? That stuff is like gunpowder, okay? There won't be anything left, including you. Yeah. Boleyn's right. Just shove him off. We'll pretend the part where we burn him to death! Yeah! Death! Death! Death! Off the edge! -Push him off! -Off the edge! -I'm out. -Off the edge! -Off the edge! -Off the edge! Walk the plank! Whoo! Off the edge! Walk the plank! -You're kidding, right? -Off the edge! -You're kidding? -What? They're my friends too. And after you leave next week, probably my only friends. Walk the plank! Walk the plank! Walk the plank! Walk the plank! Walk the plank! Walk the plank! Walk the plank! Walk the plank! Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo! Whoo! Death! Death! Hey. A lot's changed since the last time we played pirates, Bo. You okay? Yeah, yeah. I'm just... Look, I think the little ones have just been breathing in too much rotting corn fungus. Wouldn't be hard around here. So do you want to explain the car? Jeez, Bo, do I really have to spell it out for you? I mean, not if it's spelled w-e-e-d. Corn's all dying. Might as well use these fields to grow something. I turned 18 last week, Bo. I'm building a bridge just like you. I'm getting out of here. Yeah. Except it's not just Rylstone's dying corn you're escaping, is it? Come off it. It was an accident. Cal, you're not... My face hit his fist when I inserted it stupidly between my little brother and him. Accident. I'm so sorry. Don't be. Be sorry for the ones who don't have a way out. Look, speaking of getting out -- last weekend before school. You headed to the river with everyone else? No. I got to hang back, look after my investments. Guess you and I will be having Rylstone all to ourselves one last time. Just us and the little ones. Don't forget the little ones. See you. See you. - Walk the plank! - God! Jesus, what... So are the Salem witch trials over already? It was pretty sweet. Wally was freaking out. Everybody was screaming and yelling and shouting and dancing through the corn. It was pretty dope. Mom? Ceece. Let's go. Come on. Ceece, that's between Mom and Dad. Okay? Ceece. Come on. Bo, you are so blind. It's not about Mom. It's not about Dad. It's about Rylstone. It's about this place that's so broken that nobody even gives a damn enough to try to fix it. But, then, I guess that's not your problem anymore, is it, Bo? Enjoy Boston. Corn -- our corn -- is dying. -Yeah. -Yeah. In the fields not 500 yards from here, as far as the eye can see, is a sea of dying brown. What happened to the glorious golden grain that we grew up with, that our forefathers planted here? Well, we know what happened. We voted, and a majority -- a majority you know I disagreed with -- ruled. So we invited Big Corn, GrowSynth, right into our fields with their arsenal of herbicides and GMOs. And look what happened to the corn. Just didn't even know. That's what happened to my corn. -That's right. -That's what happened. There's no sense pointing fingers because what's done is done. But what that means is we have to face a new reality. Or maybe, just maybe, all those fingers are pointing the wrong way anyhow. That blight that struck our corn, maybe it's got a lot less to do with GrowSynth or any GMOs we put in our soil and more to do with us, more to do with you. Sit down, old man. Maybe what's happening out there in our corn is less about an agricultural calamity and more about a moral and spiritual abomination that has engulfed this town! Okay, now that we're done listening to that sanctimonious, Holy Rolling horse crap. It isn't about any of the cheating or the backstabbing that's been going on. It's about one thing and one thing only. Now, we was sold a hill of beans. -That's right. -Yeah! All we had to do, they said, was put this put that in the soil and alter our corn so we could sell more soda to the poor kids in the Third World. Do that, they said, and we'd be rich. Richer than we could dream. But instead, look at what happened. Sick corn and economic disaster. And that's why Rylstone has to leave corn behind. This is how we can do it. Subsidies. Subsidies? Federal government will subsidize -- pay us -- not to grow corn. But this program's fiscal year ends in less than two days, so we got to say yes and we got to do it now. We got earthmovers right at the edge of town ready to dig the trench to bury our corn. And I don't want this any more than you do. And look, it's not ideal, I admit that, but I don't think we have a choice. Yeah, well, I disagree, Dad. You all should be ashamed. Instead of being the adults when we needed you to be, you helped yourselves and left the rest of us traumatized. Rylstone sold its soul once already. And all you're doing to solve the problem, instead of trying to repair the soil, is infighting. Infighting and selling all our souls all over again as fast as you can, just to a different master. But you do have a choice. Trust me, it's not the one you're making. My beautiful daughter, Bo. Thank you. Most heartfelt and passionate, as always. And I wish I shared your optimism. But trying to restore the soil could take years. We're simply out of time. If you try to fix this, something this broken... ...you mark my words, you're just going to make it worse. So let's put it to a vote. No, Robert, I-I really must -- Sit down, Pastor. No one cares. I say aye. Let those threshers roll. Let them big boys go! Yeah. Florida time-share, here I come. Corn economy can kiss my ass. -Yeah! -Yeah! See a show of hands? All right. We're doing this. Everyone's voted. Except everyone hasn't voted. Not us. The children. They're right. It's the little ones' futures too. Yeah, they don't even get a vote, a say. 'Cause Bo is right. We have a choice. All right, enough horseshit. Children? Having a say? I thought 17-year-olds mouthing off was bad enough. Stupid kids. Hear, hear. Little kids! Voting! Yeah, well, I vote you go home and play with your toys. Okay, little girl? How does that sound? Yeah? You too, boy. You just wait till I get home. You just wait, boy. Hey, come on! Hey! Hey! That's a child, for Christ's sake. -Hey! -You're gonna be fine. All right, knock it off. That's enough. Knock it off! What is wrong with you? Okay. It's settled. In less than 48 hours, corn will be dead in Rylstone forever. Yes. Thank you. You're saying what we've been thinking. Dad. Listen, it doesn't have to be like this. It's not too late to do something. Give it a rest, Bo. It's done. Since when do you ever, ever run from a fight? I distinguish, Bo, between fighting for and fighting with. Are you talking about Rylstone or Mom? What? It's just... It's done, Bo. It's over. It's done. What happened to you? You used to be so different. I have had enough of you! You need to get out of this house! Get out of this house! The adults. I know. It sucks. It's so hard sometimes you can hardly breathe. But I can help. With your pain. ♪ He loves me ♪ ♪ He loves me not ♪ ♪ He loves me ♪ ♪ He loves me not ♪ ♪ He loves me ♪ ♪ He loves me not ♪ ♪ He loves me ♪ ♪ He loves me not ♪ ♪ He loves me ♪ ♪ He loves me not ♪ ♪ He loves me ♪ ♪ He loves me not ♪ ♪ He loves me ♪ ♪ He loves me not ♪ My father thinks if we try to fix this, it'll only make things worse. But he's wrong. We can fix this. And this is how -- public humiliation. Okay? We graphically show the world what they did to Rylstone, to us, to the corn. Sheila Boyce. Omaha. Reporter for NowCloud. I DM'd her and told her about our situation, that maybe she could cover the story, and she responded. -What? -Yeah. So are you with me? We doing this? You in or out? Let's do it. -Yeah. -Are you kidding? -What are we waiting for? -Okay. Here goes. Hello? Hi. Boleyn Williams? Yeah, yes! Miss Boyce, thank you so much for taking my call. Eden? Jesus, what -- what is all that? Blood. What blood? From Dylan's pop's hog. We're painting the corn roots red. Like the Red Queen. "Alice in Wonderland." Got to feed the corn somehow. Okay, so you really you want to heal the corn, huh? You want to save the corn? All right. As the, uh, queen, I need your help. I need you and all your little army of friends to go out, tell Pastor Penny, tell your parents, everyone, all the adults. Kind of fib, okay? You tell them that my father is calling an emergency meeting about that corn they're gonna plow under. And I need you to make absolutely sure they're at the community hall by 10:00 p.m. tonight. Think you can do that? Yeah. Okay. I'll help you do this, Bo. But why the community hall? Oh, 'cause we are gonna have us a trial. And you know, you can't have a trial without a courthouse. Plus, we got this big-time newswoman coming in from Omaha. So I need you to meet her on the road in, bring her to the community hall too. Don't forget -- 10:00 p.m. sharp. I'll see you later. Come on. You murderer. Sneak up behind you and lay something heavy across your skull and end this once and for all. You're a bad man. You're a very bad man! You think that. Go ahead, Anthony. I'm a very bad man. Keep thinking that. Somebody sneak up behind him. Somebody end this now while he's thinking about me! Aah! Wish it into the cornfield. Please, son, wish it into the cornfield, please. Well, beddy-bye for me. Yeah. I'm beat. How about you, Dad? A jack-in-the-box that still had his bad face. You mustn't think bad thoughts... Don't stay up too late, okay? Or I'll do the same thing to you. Are we making a childish mistake, Ceece? It's never a mistake to try and change the world, Bo. What are you guys doing? Dad, you know how you told me some things are worth fighting for? Well, I guess you raised me right, because that's what's happening. We're holding a mock trial, and you're the guest of honor. Don't wake Mom. Come quietly, and I promise you this will be over soon. You sure about this, Bo? Yeah, come on, Calder. We're already late. Where is everyone? No, it's okay. Trust me. Hi, Bo. Eden. Where's everybody? Where's the reporter? Sheila Boyce. Who? The reporter. From Omaha. You were supposed to pick her up. She never showed. Guess something more important must have come up. Did she... Doesn't really matter anymore, Bo. It's over. What is? What's over? You were late. So we just went ahead and did it. You did what? The trial. Where are the parents? Where is everyone? Cam. Where's Dad? What the hell is going on? Want to see something, Bo? Didn't agree with the verdict, I guess. It was always gonna take more with these kind of people, Bo. A lot more. Calder! Dad? Dad! - Help me! - Lift him! Lift him up! Lift! Lift him! Let's go. Dad! Dad. No! No! No! No! He's not laughing now. Check us out! Yeah! Come on! Come on! This is outrageous! I swear, it's gonna rain down with hellfire. I'm talking to you, Eden. Eden, honey... It's not too late to turn back. You're my daughter now. Do you think this is how you should behave? God damn! Any more questions? I didn't think so. -Are you okay? -Yeah. This is insanity. This is completely insane. Did you see what it was like out there? All the dead bodies. I don't know where my parents are. I don't know what happened to them. Let's tear this place to the ground! My phone. My phone doesn't work. Mine either. Could these little freaks have done something to the cell tower? Jesus. My brother is with them now. Rip 'em up! Bo. Bo. Do something. Help us if you can. Hit 'em! We have to. We... We can do something. Look at this! Yes, Bo. You're right. We have to stop this. -Aaaah! -No! My God. Eden. Jesus Christ. What is it you intend to do here? Well... If you really want to know. I hope you can hold your breath better than Timmy Cain, Ava Foster, Boyd Bowden, or any of my other delinquent friends. No! It's halothane! Cover your mouths! Eden, no! Eden! This is for my friends. How does it feel? How do you like it? Heya, Sheriff Gebler. Mom? What in God's name do you think you're doing? Rendering the verdict. You just wait till I get my hands on you. You little, bitch. Oh! Really? You want to mess with me? Yeah. Okay, fine. Yeah. Let's play. Steve! Joe! Let's go! Eden. -Eden, no, please. -You don't have to do this. No! You can't do this! Eden. Eden! Let us out! Stop! Bo, no! Mom! Mom! No! What are you doing?! No, no! Stop! No, don't do it! Stop! No! No! Mom! Mom! Cecil. Feed. Mom. I am sorry. My dad was right. He warned me if I tried to fix this I'd only make it worse. So get out if you can. Save yourselves. But my dad is still alive. So I'm gonna stay and stop Eden from killing him too. Yeah. Okay. Okay, Bo. Well, go to Candlestick. And get help. Hi, Bo. Eden, you can't. You cannot do this. They kill everything they touch. Putting them on trial was your idea. What did you think would happen? Not this. It's us against them. Whose side are you on? What are you gonna do with my father and the others? I'm gonna send them out to the corn, Bo. He's sick. He needs to feed. He? He Who Walks. That week I was out there... ...wandering alone in the corn... ...he talked to me. He took care of me. No adult in Rylstone ever did that for me. So now I'm going to take care of him. By killing all the adults? For starters. They ate the seed-corn, Bo. Now it's time to pay the price. If one of us can just get out of here, make it to Candlestick, we can get help, all right? Check this out! - This is insanity. - Dad, I need you to trust me. Right now, they want to know who's side I'm on, so I need you to do exactly what I say. Listen, they want to take you all out into the corn. -What? What for? -Go! Go! You'll be safe. You can get help. If that creature wants us to go into the corn, then we should be doing the exact opposite! I wouldn't worry about it. You were never going into the corn anyway. Because you stood up for it. Yes. That's right, Eden. I never had a thing to do with killing the corn. In fact, I-I spoke out strongly against it! Eden, remember that thing that happened in the foster home? Ohh. Who took you in, hmm? It was you, Pastor. You did. You took me in. You never sinned against the corn like all the rest. But, come on, Pastor. You did sin. Didn't you? -Enough! -Shut up. No! No, Eden! No, please, no! No, Eden, no! No, no, no, no! No, Eden, no! God! Oh, God, no! Please! No, Eden! No, no! God, no, no! Oh, Eden... Bo, where is she? Please, don't ask me that. Don't ask me about Mom. I need to know where my wife is! Stop! Listen, you need to go out to the corn. That's it. This is our chance to get help. Okay? This is it. Okay. I'll go. But you fight. All right? Yes. I love you. I love you too. You did good. He'll feed well tonight. Drop it, Cam. She's not a threat. Okay, Dad. I will. I will fight. And guess what else. From now on, no one in Rylstone and no one out! And if anyone cares to stop here, guess what we're gonna do. Take them! Take them into the corn! That's right. Get them into the corn. Because we don't need a single thing they have to offer! Everything we've ever needed is right here, right out there in those fields. The corn, the earth, will take care of its children. This is our world now, and we're gonna run it the way we want for a change. And we're gonna run it right! Right! And isn't just gonna be Rylstone either. We're gonna spread the word all across this country. You think there aren't others like us? Kids seeing their world and future just being traded away? Well, they're gonna take their towns, too, and make this whole world right again! -Right! -Right! -Right! -Right! -Right! -Right! Like this thing. It was going to use us, was going to sell our future. So we should cut her head off, right, Bo? No! I mean, yes. Yes. She sinned. She sinned against you. Against all of us. And that's why we shouldn't waste her blood here. Not when I can send her into the corn. That's a pretty good idea, Bo. But, Bo... An even better idea would be to take her straight to him. This way. That's it. Take her up. Doors. He Who Walks! Come! Come to us! Eden. He Who Walks, he doesn't exist. Don't you dare say that! Stay back. It can't be real. Aah! Help me! You can't hurt me, Bo. God, you idiots! You're goddamn little idiots! Brace yourself. Are you -- Are you crazy?! Grain dust. Remember? This place is full of it. You light a fire, this whole place will blow sky high. The corn and everything in it will burn. Fine. Let's chop her up. Go on. Get her. Come on! Let's go! Into the corn! Come on! Come on! Dad. I'm so sorry. Help me. Car! Yes! Keys, keys, keys. Fuck that shit. No. No. No, no, no, no. Oh, thank you. Oh, thank God. Hi, Bo. Eden. Eden, Eden. Jesus. T-This... This is madness. Craziness, insanity. You know? Yeah. It's pretty crazy. I'll give you that. What is that, Eden? Oh. This. Depositive bolt, Bo. You know, a cattle gun. I know what you're thinking. Forget it. You know I'm not the only one out here. It's past my bedtime. Let's go. A l-last cigarette at least? You smoke? Bad habit. I... ...was about to quit. Come on. Get down on your knees. Don't be scared, Bo. Hey, Eden? You really think the second you soaked me in all that tractor fuel, that I wasn't gonna make sure I ended up right... ...here? Burn. No. No, no, no! Candlestick and everyone else for miles around will be here soon. Face it. It's done. Your fantasy's finished, Eden. I'm sorry. Eden. Don't worry, Bo. Nothing ever really dies in the corn.
