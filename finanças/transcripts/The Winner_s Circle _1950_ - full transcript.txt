We'll break his neck for him. That's it, my girl. Get down! Down! I'll show you what a kick is, understand me? - Victor! Don't you have any other trousers? - No, can you imagine how greedy my brother is? He doesn't pay me enough. - Go up to the house. Yvonne will give you a pair of mine. - I'd rather you increased my wages.

And then when I arrive, you sulk. I don't want that, understand? Maybe you don't like me? But what do you all have against me? Listen. You owe me respect and obedience, and you have no right, you have no right to hate me! It's bias! Josito! Come back! I want to talk to you! The horse, for god's sake, the horse! Hey! Who looks after of that beast? - I don't know. - Oh of course, Josito! Hey, Josito! You must know that in your chosen profession, a minute of inattention can cost a fortune. Would you accept losing a fortune for a minute of inattention? - There's no need to make a drama out of it. - If you please! What's your fortune, you who have nothing? That medallion, perhaps? Yes, give me your medallion, as a guarantee of your commitment. - It was my mother's medallion. - Then it has more value in your eyes, so it's an excellent guarantee for me. - No. - You refuse? Very well. Since you are not worthy of our trust, and moreover, you're mutinous. That being the case, you'll bunk in with Charles. - Oh no, sir, please! - Again no? Decidedly, you have a contradictory spirit, my friend. - It's too dirty at Bobo's, it disgusts me. - That's perfect. I was afraid I wouldn't find a punishment you were sensitive to. You reassure me. Get your stuff and move right away. What are you doing here? - Hiding, you? - Moving, I'm going into Bobo's room. - He's going to kick me out. - Why? - I've finished my apprentice's contract. I'm entitled to a man's wages. Kids cost less and they're not allowed to open their mouth. Look—here's my replacement. I have subdued many men, and horses. You see this arm? It sent 40 of them to the hospital. The Lafarge stable! Hey boys, here's the new kid. - He's a Parisian. - Veal head. - Oh, he's brand new. Did you see his beautiful boots? A real gentleman rider. - I'm Parisian too. I live in Place de l'Opéra. What's your name? - René Barrymore. - The Gentleman for horseshit! - Get to work, bunch of idlers! You'll have plenty of time to see your friend, he's here for five years. Get out! Oh, my beauty. Papa, you must be sick to keep making this poor old nag sweat. Are you trying to kill it? - Don't worry, it's like me, indestructible. Strong as a Turk. But flexible as a wand. - When you find a man as smart and as good as a horse, don't let him go, make him your friend. - Yes sir. - Call me Victor. Friends? - Yes. Hey, you two up there! Need any help to come down or not? - What's this? You asleep? Good morning. You're René, aren't you? - And Emile? - In the bathroom. - Again! It isn't cleanliness any longer, it's vice. Emile! - He's not even thirteen. - I'm 14 years and 3 months. - You've chosen a hard profession. - My Dad chose it. And your mother? - She's my stepmother. - Here. May I present to you a real ace. He comes from the colleges of Paris and he speaks Latin. - But Alex didn't tell me he was sending me an altar boy. 45 kilos, you're fat. I'll try to lose weight. - That'll come by itself. Do you have your contract? - Yes sir. You know that your father's signature entrusts you to me for five years? I'll try to make you a man and, if possible, a jockey. In compensation, I expect from you unwavering zeal and loyalty. Do we agree? Yes. Well come in! What now? - Sir, I've thought it over. I'd rather leave you my medallion. - So you don't have to share Bobo's room? - Yes sir. - You prefer your comfort to the memory of your mother. In short, you're not as noble as you would like to believe. I'm sorry, I've reserved your former bed for your new friend. - Sir, you know I don't want to disturb anyone. - Are you sure? - Yes, I can sleep anywhere. - Very well, Josito, thank your new comrade, who can sleep anywhere. Help him settle into the room he has chosen. Go on, go—go and lose your Latin. - Give me a suitcase. - No, I'll carry them. - Josito! We're not done yet. Your medallion. I'll give it back to you in two months, if you deserve it. - I don't care, I'll sue him. What! What is this? - No, boss, I wasn't sleeping. I had a dizzy spell. The least I could do was lie down a bit. Ah, it's you, boy. I'm in a bad way. I can't get any sleep. - Yes, you have to move. I've brought a tenant. - Hello, colleague! Simon Pourfrimant. Does that remind you of anything? Winner of the Biarritz Grand Handicap in 1919 and the Bordeaux Grand Prix in 1920. - Oh sod off with your memories. The boss is looking for you. - Oh dear, oh dear! - Is that my bed? - You know, when we're tired, we sleep all over the place. - And it stinks. - Hey you, apparently I disgust you? We'll talk about that later. For now, get out! If you like something clean, that's your business. I'm not against cleanliness. It's all the leather scrapings from the saddlery that stink, not me. - Bobo, you haven't finished. What about the oats? - All right, I'm coming. I'll buy your boots off you. - They're not for sale. - We'll talk about it later. La Cagnotte, done, Saint-Eustève, done. Well that's all. - I passed one! I passed two! Only Emile Lafarge was in front. The least of them. I beat him on the finish line by a neck. - No point in saying that over and over. They all know it's not true. - The kid doesn't know that yet. And stay behind a while to clean your leathers. I've seen some that are disgusting. Anyone who has an accident with his saddle, it'll be his own fault. - Hey, gentleman, come and take a look at my saddle. It'll be up to you to take care of it now. - Hey, little guy. Did you get the wrong address? - No. - Are you sure you weren't going to the Bois de Boulogne dressed like that? - Take a good look, that's how you clean a saddle. - Do you even like horses? Except the boots. - I don't know. My Dad wanted it. He wanted to be a jockey when he was young. - He didn't make it? - His parents didn't want him to. - So he sent you instead. Funny— - Watch what I'm doing instead of telling your life story. Here, rub a little. - Do you know someone called Alex by any chance? - That old bastard? We were apprentices together. - He's a friend of my father. He recommended me to M Lafarge. - Look at the recommendation. He recommended me too. And do you know how much it brings him? 10,000 francs! - He's made a success of his life. He deals in kids. Less dirty than manure, at first glance. - We shouldn't talk down our profession. There are funny moments. - Of course! - Sport, the great outdoors, it preserves us. Look at Simon. He's 52—you'd never think it. He still has all his own teeth. And they're holding well. It guarantees you that. How much do you weigh? - 45 kilos. - Well Simon, with no effort, can lift two of you with his teeth. - Really? - That's the least of it. - Want to bet? - I'm starting to get old, anyway. - Come on, Simon, you're not chickening out? Josito, come here. - Oh no! Leave me out of your exhibitions. - Go on. You only weigh 45 kilos too. - All right, lie on top of him, back to back. - Grab each other's arms. Yes, but what about the boots? That's extra weight. - Too bad, try it anyway. You might break your record. The new boy.—what's happening to him? - His education. - Savages! Can't you stop it? - Nobody's stopping anything. Your little angel will be doing the same to everyone else at the first opportunity. Isn't your stock of kidneys empty yet? - You just have to change digs, you'll get lamb. - Talk about a jockey's diet. It's more for fattening up pigs! - Shut up! Whoever isn't hungry shouldn't have dinner. He'll be lighter on the horse. You need to be on time. This isn't a restaurant. There aren't three sittings. - Come with me. Does my cooking disgust you? - Oh no, Madame. - You don't need to be polite. You're not a guest. But be patient, it'll come. Appetite comes with fasting. - Aren't you hungry? - No, not very. - Fine, give it to me. - Josito, you glutton! Why do you have to guzzle other people's share? Don't be a soft touch, René, eat. - Something stinks in this corner! - It's the kidneys. - Oh no, worse than that. Here it is! It's the gentleman who didn't wash his face properly. Change your scent, gentleman. You want to fight? - Yes! - But we don't fight in here. We live as good comrades. What's in your heads! Is fighting all you think about? Wait until you're men before killing each other. You! To your place! Go on, eat, it's getting cold. - No I can't. I can't! Your cheese can run fast. It arrived before you did. - Shut up. You don't know what's good. - Hey, give us the wine bottle here. - It's really not worth being in the middle of the vineyards. Cheers. And keep sticking to the wall. What's this? - Cracked corn. It's not bad. Taste it. - No thanks. Do you want my sandwich? I don't want it. What did you have in the morning? - Café au lait. - Saddle up! This isn't a hunt meet is it? Ah, the café au lait.. A change of diet. I'll be your friend, okay? - If I stay. - You want to leave? What about your contract? Don't be silly, you couldn't become a jockey. You have nice boots! - Yes. Hey, gentleman, are you going to make your first communion? - Yes, what have you done with your beautiful boots? Are you bored already? Going back to school? - Those boots aren't yours, are they? - I bought them. - What with? - Credit. Go on, tie it up. The trick is not to show fear. The horse sees you three times bigger than you are. He's the one who's afraid. Here, look. There you see? Here, look. All right, little one, stay calm. what's the matter? Here. And always a short chain. Because when these little chaps get bored, they try to grab one of your ribs—with their teeth. A rib, or something else. That's the least of it. Have a look at the teeth. A real millstone. If they get hold of them, they don't cut them off. They crush them. Ask the boss how it feels. Apart from that, it's man's noblest conquest. It's perfect. But if you want my opinion, the best part of the horse— is still the steak. - That's a weird outfit. - There's no patronage here. Why aren't you wearing your boots? - They hurt my feet. - Go and put on your trousers. And get leggings from Bobo. He has an almost new pair. If he moans, just send him to me. I'll tell him what I think. - If he was my son, he wouldn't be here. - If he were your son, he'd look different. He looks a bit like me, don't you think? - Are you crazy? - No kidding, I have a picture of me when I was a kid. Exactly the same. - Too bad you grew up. Are you still hungry? Here, have this. - No thanks. - Eat it, it's good. Roast beef. - I don't want it. - Why? Because I bit into it? I don't have scabies, you know. I'm a nice guy, but don't go too far. - Leave me alone! - Say straight out that I disgust you. Say it! I disgust you! I disgust you! Just say it! I disgust you! Say it! Say it like that, I'll give you something to be disgusted about!. Lower your eyes, would you? Insolent wretch! I disgust you! Just you wait! Go and get changed. Come on, I didn't hurt you that much. Anyway, it's your own fault. You're all against me. Hey, I'm just having a bit of a rest. I haven't slept all night. I have good health, but I can't get any sleep. What are you doing? Packing? No, no kidding, are you leaving? - Yes. - Well done, little fellow. Get out of here. You'll have much better things to do in life than shovelling horseshit. See where I am, after 40 years in the business. Mended everywhere, broken legs, broken arms, broken collarbone, skull fracture. Just some nice memories. They're especially beautiful, because I embellish them a little. Misery! So, you're leaving? - Yes. - Well, I'll help you pack your trunk. I'm fed up. The face they're going to make. This isn't yours, is it? - Yes, it is. - Well, Bobo's wasting no time. What about this? - Mine too. - Give it to Josito, from me. Canter up to 1500 metres. Same for you, canter up to 1500 metres. 2000 metres fast. And if the horse is okay, push its speed in the last 100 metres. By the way, Michel, your contract is up. It'll be difficult to keep you on. - Don't dance around it. I understood when I saw the new kid. - Well, so much the better. - Only, the new boy? Don't rely too much on him. He's leaving. René! René! - Let him run. It'll give him character. From what Alex wrote to me, we'll see him again. I'll go and get some money. - Good idea. But leave me your luggage as a reminder. - Is someone waiting for you at home? - Why? Isn't there anyone there? - Oh yes. Some have left but there are some who stayed. - Mum! - I'm coming down. Your Dad didn't tell you? - No, tell me what? - Well, he dumped me. You can go and get him back. COPONAT & Co Silk - Wool I know where your father is. I didn't want to say it in front of the boss. He's at Auteuil. - Thank you Monsieur. First, Côte Rose. First, Côte Rose. First. - Hey Alex, your nag is at 7 to 1. - What did I tell you? - So Mr. Alex, did you win? Me, I always win. My clients can't say the same. - Hey Alex, what should I do in the next? - 10 on Anisette in the third. - Hey, make sure there's something for me. - All right. What are you doing here? I came back. I was too unhappy. - Oh that old one! "I was too unhappy". Have you seen your father? - No, I'm looking for him. - He'll be happy to see you again. "I was too unhappy". The stuff I have to listen to! But, little man, you're no longer nursery age. What did they do to you? Did they forget to tuck you in at night? Was your chocolate not hot enough? Your classmates weren't nice? - They beat me up, and then— - And then—what? That's life, little guy. You're not a girl. I've been there too. I know what it's like. But that didn't stop me becoming a man. A real man. You should have been a priest. And even— Look! There's your father. - What's the meaning of this? - Your poor little baby was too unhappy. - What? Is this your son? Isn't he lovely? He looks like you. - What's the meaning of this? Don't talk harshly to this little one. He's so cute. - Lucienne, please. - He has exactly your green eyes. And your forehead. It's exactly your forehead. You can't deny it. The boy is right anyway, if they martyred him, they're brutes. You have to file a complaint. They haven't delivered the dining room furniture yet. Ah. Here's the ceiling light. You can see how beautiful it is. - And yet another bill to pay! - Credit's convenient. We don't realize we're spending money. - Well, come in! As you see, it's not set up for family life. - He can use the armchair. He'll sleep very well. - Well make yourself useful. Close the shutters. - Darling, we're so comfortable in our little love nest. You don't love your dear little langoustine any longer? - Yes but— - There's no but. - One second. Well, take off your things. Don't stand there like a candle. It's surprising how much he smells of horse. - Have you swallowed your tongue? - I don't smell it. - What do you smell? Well? - It smells of—patchouli? - My God, that's funny. Do you like that perfume? - Well? - Yes— No, I mean— - Why are you waiting to take off your socks? Dare I hope your feet are clean? We're going to heat a basin of water for him. - We'll see about that tomorrow. Well? I'm waiting! It's travel dust— Yes, at least one round trip with a little visit to the manure. You have no shame? - Franky, you're being cruel. - No. Leave us, will you? Listen, René. There are things that are difficult to explain to one's son. I would like you to make an effort. You'll understand later, but for now, it's a matter of tact. - Am I embarrassing you? - Me? Not at all. I'm not embarrassed. You're not embarrassing anyone, in fact. But if you want to know what I feel, it's you who should be embarrassed. - What for? Don't interrupt me continually. This isn't my house. I thought placing you there was for the best. You would be free, and so would I. It doesn't matter about me. It's mainly about you. I've always sacrificed myself for your well-being. That's what parents do. No need to labour the point. But think about the career that was opening in front of you. - I don't like horses very much. - It's not just about the horses. There's glory. Ah, if only I could be you. The finish at Longchamp, the crowd, the money, silk jackets on their backs, the screams. René Barrymore wins the Grand Prix de Paris! Don't you get it? - The Grand Prix de Paris doesn't take place in the countryside. The countryside isn't so far from Paris. There now, you're discouraging me. You have no ambition. - Yes I have. I'd have liked to be an engineer. - You can't be an engineer in a racing stable, obviously. - If you send me back to college, I wouldn't be in the way. - You're useless in college. And what about the high fees? I'm not a millionaire. Wool is in crisis right now. And to pay for your studies— - René, I didn't know you were so selfish. No no, not another word. ♪ Love's delight lasts but a moment, ♪ ♪ Love's heartbreak is lifelong. ♪ - Think about all this before you go to sleep. Let your heart speak. Good night. I daren't turn on the taps. - Why? - They make a noise, it'll disturb him. - No. - And it's embarrassing. - No, he's asleep. - Already? Are you sure? If I were you, I'd get in before the call-up. You'll only be really free after military service. - Yes, that's the plan. Victor, you're a nice guy. - Fine, fine. You only realize that now? Better late than never. On my way! So—am I leaving? - Well, good luck! - "Good luck"? That's all you have to say to me? "Good luck," go and die wherever you want. Now you're too expensive for me. - Let go, the horses are waiting for me. - I've been waiting five years! And what have you done for me in five years? Just a stable boy. Just good enough not to starve. Oh yes—promises! "Go for it, Michel, you'll become my first jockey." "You'll ride my best horses." Only as soon as there's an interesting race, Monsieur has hired jockeys from Paris. And all that time, what about me? I rode donkeys and wiped their arses! It's you—you don't deserve my trust. - So off you go. - Wait, I haven't finished. Listen, boys, all of you! You know he's stealing your time and your future. If you can't say anything now, wait until your contract is up. I'm the living proof. - Be quiet, please. You don't know what you're talking about. - I dreamed about this moment for months. I dreamed of kicking your arse. But today I'm a man. And I won't touch you. I'll only fight with a man. With a man, you hear? - Victor, are you letting me be insulted? - Forgive me, but I don't think he's entirely wrong. - Even your brother! You exploit him too. But what do you have left in life? Your wife's pity? You're simply pathetic. You hear? Pathetic! Who dares? Who dares insult my child! who dares? Who dares? Who? Who dares to insult my child! My own little man! He'll pay for it! He'll see who he's dealing with! The bosses are in a bad mood. - You've got a lot of nerve, Michel. Watch out, boys, he's coming! - I beg your pardon for earlier. - Take a break, you're soaked. Be careful! Bobo's in a mess. Because of that rotten saddle. I already told you to get rid of it. - But the saddle's still perfectly solid. - That's the proof. - I've just repaired it. It's a good saddle, almost new. - Do what I tell you! You can't repair kids, can you! - What's broken? - One leg, in three places. Isn't that enough for you? - Is it serious? - Three months in hospital. We have to call the insurance. René! René! Oh Madame, is that for us? - Do you like it? - Oh yes. I'll go and show it to Josito. Madame, it's great living next to you. - Don't you want to go home any more? - My home is here now. I can see you from my window. - Okay, off you go. Great! The others will be drooling. They'll have never seen a choir like ours. - The boss's wife will be proud of us.

Me, me! - Me! - You don't spit on the roast nowadays. - However much we yell at them, it doesn't take away their appetite. - In your arse. - Did you hear the gentleman? He's enriched his vocabulary. By the way, you left your work unfinished. If that starts again, one of you's in Bobo's room. That little game won't last long with me. You're doubling up with the horseshit now? When one is gone, the other's not here. When I yell at one, the other one groans. Why do I bother to keep talking? It's like pissing in a violin to play the Marseillaise. Where are you going? - Dad came to see me. So you can eat in peace. He's not your father. Go on, go to your place. - Oh, the devastating separation... He's a heartbreaker. - Shut it! There's a bullfight in the air. If you worked with me, you wouldn't be this skinny. - I have to be light. - Jockey? Why a jockey? Picador, I would have understood. But jockey's not a Spanish profession. If your poor mother could see you— - I like it. - Are the bosses nice at least? - Yes, yes, very nice. - Have you lost your medallion? - No, I entrusted it to M Lafarge so as not to lose it. - Want a bunch of bananas? - No thanks. Dad, have you thought about carpets? - Yes Yes. Here they are. - It's even more beautiful than in the window. René, come and look. - Thank you, sir. If Dad wasn't so far away, he'd help us too. Is there anyone to dry my back? - I'll do it. Get out! Get out! René! Josito! Josito! What? Is there a fire? Can't you get some air in there? - Oh no, it's too hot. Fred! You might answer when I call you. - I rest in the afternoon. I'm off duty. If I have to answer away from work, I'm really not paid enough. - Are you there? Open the door! I can hear you, you know? Open! - Shit! - It's so clean, it looks like my girlfriends' room. - I'm going to do the same in our room. - Just you try it! Get the hell out of here, you guys with your dirty feet! - Now it's us who get to be yelled at. We should have brought her roses, like the other day. - She told us not to. - Because it's expensive. But it made her happy anyway. - I wish I was five years older. - Why? - I'd be of legal age. I'd take her to Spain. - But what about me? - One of us would have to sacrifice himself. Anyway, friendship doesn't last forever. Whereas love is sacred. - What about her husband? - She doesn't truly love him. You'll see. - Yvonne. - Yvonne! I need to know where Emile is. Emile! Emile! - What's wrong? - These two little darlings are getting their gender mixed up. And that needs to be stopped immediately. - You're crazy, my poor Victor. - I know what I'm talking about! Take a look at their room! - What's wrong with their room? - It's clean! - Well good for them! - It's even more than clean. It looks like a real bedroom. It's not normal. They spend their life together. They hardly speak to the others. It looks like they're no longer part of the stable. They go home every evening, to their little villa. If this continues, I'll no longer dare to call them tu. - Do they do their work conscientiously? - Yes! They do it on purpose so that I've nothing to reproach them with. - What else do you want? - We all live together here! All the same! I don't want a clique. These two need to be separated. - If you think that's better. - No no! This time I won't let you. Does it upset you they're happy without you? My poor friend, you've never been able to make anyone happy. Give others a chance. - So this is a wonderful chance for them? - Can't you touch anything without soiling it? You think only of evil—doing evil, seeing evil, speaking about it. And all your dirty sniggering among yourselves. They're children. What can you possibly understand about children? About children you're responsible for educating. And when they end up looking like you, maybe you'll think you've made men of them? - Jockeys. That's all I ask. - All this fuss disgusts me. And there's the bad example. - The bad example? My poor Victor, look in a mirror!. - Those are all just words. Only one thing interests me: that they do they do their work conscientiously. Then I don't have to punish them. - Yeah you—as long as there's nothing to lose. - What's your decision? - Victor will do as he sees fit. - Of course! He gets to do whatever he likes in peace and quiet, and so much the worse for the kids! - You're upsetting me. - Emile, do something to please me for once. Send them to Périgueux on Sunday. Josito can ride Minotaure. That'll give you time to think. Hey, don't you have a little apple for me? - And for me? A really sweet one. - No, they're keeping them for the dinette in their little bedroom. - Moron, if you weren't messed up already, I'd sort you out. - Just try it! - Bastard! That's a challenge. Josito, can you get to 42 kilos? - Yes sir. - Perfect. You can ride Minotaure 2 the day after tomorrow in Périgueux. Go and get ready. Take the train tonight. One of your comrades will accompany you. I'll decide later who it'll be. Try going in straight. He's afraid of the dark. Come on, my boy. Come on. - Don't pull it, silly boy. Wait. - Yeah. You're really strong. - And again, that's a calf. If you'd seen Triple-Patte getting on the train— I carried it at arm's length. You do the same. Take the opportunity to see some girls. It'll prevent you from having bad habits. Don't worry about us. - Goodbye, Père Lafarge. Farewell, calves, cows, pigs. Stay up to your neck in your manure! Go back to die in your dirty stable. We don't care. We're going to travel the world. We've seen enough of you, all of you. - Change of scenery. - The good life for us. What were you saying? - We were saying goodbye to you. - No point yelling like that. We'll meet again. - What do you know about it? Dad, look at my jacket. These are the colors of the Duchess of Oloron. - Well done, my boy! You can take your supplies back. I still have three kilos to lose. - What are you going to eat? - Pills. - Pills! Hey, we could sell the horse and walk around like this all our lives, on the sly. Tomorrow, at 2 p.m. On the Hippodrome des Françaises. Grand equestrian meeting. Flat, trotting, steeplechase. Many participants. Tomorrow at 2 p.m. We'll take the horse in, then you can go to dinner. - I won't eat. - Aren't you hungry? - If you're not eating, neither am I. It'll be good for me. - You're completely nuts. Do you know why they make fun of us at the stable? - Because they don't like us. - It's because they believe—things. - What things? - Disgusting things. - Are you thirsty? - Listen. What if we go and see some girls, that would shut them up. - Girls? Where? - You're completely dumb at times. Shall we go? - But we're too young. - Think about it, old chap. I don't know if it's so funny, but after what's been said about us, it's our duty. - Before the race, maybe isn't the best time. - On the contrary, I hear it makes you lose weight. Listen, do you have money on you? - Yes. - Give it to me. No danger of getting robbed. Michel warned me. Get in. - It's closed. - Push harder, they won't eat us. 300 francs. - 100 francs? - Yes, plus 200 for the atmosphere. Are you here to have fun, kids? I can't feel my legs any more. I have bad blood circulation. And at this hour, my ankles are swelling already. Hey, little blond, if your father could see you. - He only has to be here. Do you have 350 francs? - You know I don't. - Well, trust reigns. - You're rich enough to do whatever you want to me. - Leave them to me, they're my grandchildren. They broke their piggy bank to come and see me. - Are you their piggy bank now? Well, kids, that one doesn't give change. - Don't listen to her. She's jealous because you're going to bring me luck. My name's Yvonne, do you like it? I'm used to horsemen. The 18th Spahi is here. But I don't often see such little ones. - Obviously, we're jockeys. - Ah, jockeys. That's why. How old are you? - 18. - My compliments, you don't look it. Just 18 or about to be 18? - About to be 18. - Well, go and wait outside for your 18th, old boy. It may not be long in coming—two or three years. - Are you taking away my two little fetishes? - To the cops they're not fetishes, they're minors. And minors here bring bad luck. Come on, guys, stand up. The bakery's open until 10. If you like sweets, they're as good there as they are here. I guarantee it, I'm the boss. Here, it's my round. That guy's gona go bankrupt. - We can still say we saw them close. - Even very close. In Bamako, we were a handful of heroes. The order was "conquer or die". - Mr President, it's time. - Gentlemen, may the best man win. How many in the first race? - Just one, Mr. President. Minotaure 2, owned by the Duchess of Oloron, ridden by apprentice Benvenida. - A walk-over? Good start. - Luckily we have military cross-country. - How many participants? - 42, Mr. President. Almost all from the 18th Spahi. - That's not a race, it's a cavalry charge. Congratulate yourselves, gentlemen civilians. Once again the Army saves the day. Minotaure 2? - Yes. - Get ready, you're the only one racing. - The only participant? - What about my weight? - That doesn't matter. Come on! - Hold the horse a minute, we'll be right back. Two sandwiches! I'm hungry! - A porto-flip. - Same for me! That drink warms the ears! - Yes, it gives a boost before the effort. Another round? - Take it easy, it's not grenadine syrup. - Mr. Benvenida, we're looking for you. You don't seem to realise that two thousand people are waiting for you. - Two thousand customers for one horse? They won't be happy. - D'you feel better? - No, I'm not well, I ate too quickly. - Come on, follow me. - You're not going to be sick? - It's the boost. Feels like I took it on my skull. You start at the turn after the gate on the right of the centre track. You'll finish at the second post of the stands. Ten minutes to complete your race. Start at the bell. Well? Come on! The other way! The other way! - Ah, finally, a horse on the track. Look at these jockeys. They ride like monkeys. And in the Army, you have to teach them everything again. Stop! Stop, kid! Go slowly! Gently! Stop! - What's this? A comic interlude? Does he take himself for M Loyal? I'm sick! - Up you get, my little boy. Now is not the time to be sick. And try to take the right track! The flat one! Come on! Go! My word, but he's having fun! So Benvenida, are you taking a nap? - I can't find the track. - It's over there. Straight on and turn left. Stop, stop! To the left! Where is he? - He's at the jumps. Do you feel better? - Yes. Where's my horse? - What? Is he hurt? - No, I think he's drunk. Come on! Come on! Come on! Go ahead! Come on! - He hasn't won yet, you know. There's only one minute and seventeen seconds left. - To lose in a walk-over, I've never seen that. - I'll make you a bet. Three seconds, two seconds, one second— He failed. I won my bet. Oh, failed. We're not going to quibble over two seconds. - Excuse me! The time is the time, and the rules are the rules. - Well? - Failed! Failed? Failed— Failed— Failed! Failed in a walk-over. And you damage a horse to accomplish this performance. Congratulations! Since you're no longer interested in anything besides your private life, then you won't ride a horse again. I'll use you to the best of your abilities. You'll clean the yard. You'll pick up the manure. Well, at least they'll cost me less. All right, dismiss. - Shall I put Minotaure back in? - No! Leave him while he still has three legs. You're too dangerous. I'm starting to believe you were right. - Don't exaggerate. He didn't lose on purpose. Leave it. Now isn't the time to make a fuss. - Fuss! They're the ones making a fuss! And I'm tired of their fuss. Well lovebirds, back in your little room? What am I being told about you two? Have you no shame? I beg your pardon, sir. I didn't do it on purpose. I slipped. I didn't think you would fall with me! I beg your pardon. - You had it coming! Can't you leave those kids alone? René! Please come back? Put it down. - I'm scared. You have no right to touch me. Dad forbade it. - And my father? Did you have the right to touch him? - I thought he was strong. - Strong? That poor old man? With his tongue, yes. He's just skin and bone. - I didn't know. - What are you doing here? I'll deal with this alone with him! And close the door! I don't want to beat you. I know you're unhappy. Drop the pitchfork! How do you expect me to make others obey me if they see you standing up to me? - You mustn't touch me! - I give you my word. But on one condition. You don't brag about it in front of the others. Go outside! - Well, was it good? - Get to work! Idlers beware! - He just got a good beating, the darling of your heart. I'd take care if I were you. - Yeah, well, he can try. I'll denounce him to the police - The police? - Yes, the police! You take advantage of René's father being far away. But mine is close. He'll know how to defend me. - I didn't do anything to him. - Liar, filthy brute. I hate you! - That's enough! - Filthy brute! Filthy brute! - It's not true. I'm not a filthy brute!! Why a filthy brute? It's not true! Why? Josito! Josito! What's wrong? - Leave me alone! Leave me alone! - Josito, come back. Come and let me take care of you. Come back, my little boy. Cry, you'll piss less! Understood? I don't want a scandal. Victor was wrong. He knows it and he regrets it. Convicting him wouldn't help anyone. No one will speak. Least of all you. - So Josito will be in the wrong? - There isn't a trainer will want him. He'll only be able to work at his father's shop. I'll forgive Josito if he'll right the wrong he's done us. - So, he's the one who has to apologize? Of course, you didn't see anything either. Where were you? - In the attic. I was resting a little. At night, I get no sleep. - Yes, you daren't say a word for fear of losing your job. - My job? Me, Simon Pourfrimant? If I wanted I could be first boy at Carter's in Chantilly tomorrow. Carter's an old pal. - I know why you're not sleeping. It's because you're ashamed. Hey there! René! René! You know your friend will be accused of defamation if he can't substantiate his complaint. - I told you I don't know anything. - He was counting on you, though. He told us— "With him, I'm not afraid." "He's not a coward. He'll tell you the truth." Fine. We'll tell him he was wrong. We shouldn't grow old. We become too ugly. We do despicable things for a pittance. René! Oh what a beautiful animal! Is it mine? - But everything you see here is yours, Madame la Duchesse. You've bought everything. The horses, the men, the house, the wine, the men and the hours of sleep. - That's wonderful. And I don't even notice it. I hope that poor animal won't roll over? No, in any case, it wouldn't be hurt. The kid will serve as a mattress. It's a mare? No, it's a stallion, Madame la Duchesse. Entire. - Your Grace, we're leaving for the racetrack. - Yes, I have an appointment in an hour. - Me too. - Isn't the brother here today? - No, he's away on a trip for at least a week. - With horses? - Yes—some old lags— - What are old lags? - I need you, Simon. Go and prepare Saint-Clostène. - But I have no more saddles. - Find one, old chap. - Here you are, and don't come back . I don't have another scrap of leather. - And one saddle for the ace of aces! One! - There are no more saddles! There's nothing left! Give me a break. - Tell your son yourself. I'm not ready for a shouting match. - Leave me alone! If I find anything, I'll let you know. I can't create new saddles. He only has to buy more if he wants to impress his Duchesse from Chicago. No, that's not good. That one's screwed. Maybe in the attic. ♪ When Sunday lovers got lost on Monday. ♪ - Hey, mouche. Did Josito clean your windows? He'd be better coming back. - It's Victor who'll come back. He must have thought about him in jail. - There are no saddles left. You have to buy some more. - Well, old chap, aren't you asleep? - Me? Asleep? Hilarious. Simply hilarious. Nah, I'm not going to cut it up. Are we ready, Monsieur? - Yes Madame, we're ready. - Watch out for my car, you! - René, be careful! Come on, get down! Switch horses with Simon. Hey, you, you haven't seen the— They've gone! - We have to do something. - Do what, Père Lafarge? Fred, Louis, René, Lucien, Ernest. Light canter up to 800 meters. And then back to me at the gallop. René, your saddle! Your saddle, René! Ramon Benvenida - Epicerie Bordeaux Spanish specialties Quick! Quick! There you are! - René's on Bobo's saddle! He's galloping over there! - Oh my God! What's this? A vagrant? René! René's galloping on Bobo's saddle! - Is that any reason to appear in such an outfit in front of Madame la Duchesse? - I don't give a damn about your Duchesse when it comes to a kid's life! Bastard! So the horse ate your heart out along with the rest. Oh it hurts, It hurts! - Where does it hurt? - My arm! - Lift it. - They did it on purpose. On purpose to get back at you. - That's crazy! Why take revenge? I'm not angry with you. Lift your arm. I can't look at it up close. I'm too sensitive. Let's go, Jimmy. It's ruined my day. You know, René, in life, it's sometimes because of a hard blow that we succeed. - Dad, I love you, you know. Wait, I'm going to say goodbye to a friend. - Yes, be quick though, we're in a hurry. - Come on, there's no time to waste. Dad will find you a position with a future. Not too close to home, preferably. - Monsieur, please. - Shame— He was as suited to being a jockey as the boss is to being an artist. You'll have to face up to it: he won't be a jockey. We can't even make a soldier out of him. Well, too bad for him. He'll console himself during the years of war. Place him anywhere, in any job. There are lots of funny little jobs for useless people. Society is well organized. It's tailor-made. - But Monsieur, I don't know you. - Of course you do. I'm your son. As he almost became. That's the least of it.
