[music playing] CAPTAIN: Good afternoon, this is your captain again. We're about 80 miles north of Miami International. We are about to begin our final approach. I'd like to take this time, on behalf of the crew, to thank you for flying with us today. And we hope you'll include Carnival Airlines in your future travel plans. [music playing] FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Miss Hamilton? Miss Hamilton? We'll be landing in just a few minutes. ANNOUNCER: Carnival flight 770 from JFK now Lauren, welcome. You look fabulous, as always. Raul? Thank you. Are you blind? No, I always carry this one myself. Raul remembered. So are you happy, healthy, psyched? We've got a full night's work ahead of us. Now the good news-- no more hotel. Daddy bought this nice little villa for clients to stay. She's our 9:15. The Italian blonde's our 9:30. But you have got to see Heidi. She'll be by as soon as she's off her shoot in Key West. You'll see her, you'll want her, you'll grab her. Excuse me. Let's leave the ladies alone. I swear this city's going to the dogs. [horns honking] Don't you want to make sure it's all there? I'm sure it is. I see you're still not shaving. My father lets him get away with it. See if you can avoid the traffic, will you? We are not running on Spanish time. LAUREN: I'm not using the perfume bottle in these shots. I'm going for something different. Right, right, right, right. Nothing but beautiful babes lying in the Palm Beach sun. Don't you worry, Lauren. I'm going to keep you up to your ears in them. I only need one-- the right one. Now, Lauren, you're not going to get picky on me again, are you? I mean, last time was bad enough. This isn't just another job, Jennifer. Oh, please. All they ever want is something sleek and sexy. No, that's just it. They don't want slick this time. They want it real, provocative. Not glossy, but raw. Raw? Yeah, they want it passionate. Something that strikes a nerve. You know, I don't even know myself how to get it yet. So, is the husband taking a later flight? No, Stephen is staying in New York. JENNIFER: Oh, really. [speaking spanish] LAUREN: I love it. JENNIFER: It's gorgeous, isn't it? Mrs. Spencer will show you up to the bedroom. Hi, it's me. Yeah, well we'll be there within the hour. As soon as she's changed. Order in some dinner from next door. Any calls? Yeah. Is that it? [phone ringing] Should I get that, Mrs. Hamilton? No. But do me a favor-- hang up the things in that one. Hello? Stephen. Yeah, just now. Fine. How did you find me? Well, you're being awfully attentive all of the sudden. How do you expect me to be? Yeah, well, maybe you should have thought about that before. Yes, you said that. But over for you and whoever she is is one thing, for me-- Stephen, I don't want to have this conversation now, OK? I've got work to do. Yes. Bye. Thanks, that's a great help. I thought you'd like it a little cooler. Yes, that's-- thank you. I don't need anything else. I mean, you can tell Jennifer and Miss Perkins I'll be down in about 15 minutes. Thank you Yeah, cooler. [music playing] [SINGING] Shu wop, shu wop, my baby. Shu wop, shu wop, shu wop, shu wop, my baby. Shu wop, shu wop. Mama say, mama say. Mama say, mama say. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Mama say, mama say.

Mama say, mama say. Don't cry. Mama say, mama say. JENNIFER: If you ask me, Heidi's all you really need. LAUREN: All right, put an option on her. Well, we've got another group coming in the studio tomorrow. We're more than covered. Thanks for being so on top of this, Jennifer. I really appreciate it. Hey, only the best for you, babe. What did I tell you about the new car? [music playing] [SINGING] You better shop around. LAUREN: Why do you take it? RAUL: Excuse me? Jennifer. She always gives you such a hard time. But it doesn't mean anything. No? Well, it's a job. I work for Mr. Perkins. If he wants me to drive his daughter around, that's fine with me. Yeah, he's an interesting guy. There's some great faces here. Fabulous houses with nobody home. What are you looking for? LAUREN: I wish I knew. It's usually pretty simple. I see the face I want, I know what to shoot. But it's not about a face this time. It's about an image that's sexy. For real, not just flash. It can't be fake. It has to be felt. Raul, let's stop. I want to see this club. [music playing] [SINGING] Get on with it. Get on. Get on with it. Get up. Get on with it. Hey, Raul. [inaudible] Hi. LAUREN: Very pretty. Alena? She's beautiful. I guess it runs in the family.

[music playing] [heavy breathing] [phone ringing] Hello? STEPHEN: Hey, sweetheart. Did you just finish up? No, I got finished a while ago. We didn't come straight back. I took in some sights. Stephen, what it this? [inaudible] You said I wasn't paying any attention. So here I am, attentive as can be. Hey, how'd you like the new luggage? Yeah, it's lovely, it's fine. Stephen, this is just her guilt talking. Are you alone? Of course I am. It's a terrible thing, because now is when you and I should be with each other. You've run off on your own again. Lauren, let's leave this behind us. I have. I want us to be together again. Isn't that what's important? What's important is that things change. Things have to get better between us. STEPHEN: It will be. Lauren, you know you can have everything you want with me. You know that-- the best of everything. But to have it, we've got to be there for each other. I'm committed to that now, more than ever. The question is, are you? I've got to go. Bye. All right, good night. [music playing] Good, now straight. Beautiful. [inaudible] camera. [shutter clicks] Good, thank you. Brinig in the next girl, please. Clifford, can we lose the scarf? [music playing] OK, let's take a look at her. [music playing] [shutter clicks] Good, give me profile. Head back. Good. OK. [shutter clicks] Ah, lose the dress. And play with the scarf. OK, get down. Good, there. [shutter clicks] Come alive. Good. Beautiful. [shutter clicks] Arch your back. Put you head back. Turn. Come on, turn, move. OK, back to me. Look at me. [shutter clicks] Get rid of the scarf. Lose the scarf. Good. Go down. Good. Turn your back to me. Good. Over your shoulder. OK. [music playing] This is it, dammit. This is what I'm looking for. So are we cooking, or what? Heidi's ready. Oh, good. Where the hell have you been? I need those dresses picked up at Finerlooms. [speaking spanish] [speaking spanish] Yeah. You have a good time? Yeah. OK. I want you thinking about that. I want you to think about the way it was last time. OK. Turn your back. Look at me, all right. And run your hands down your body. Imagine they're his hands. It feels good, doesn't it? His hands feel good on your skin, huh? Good. Imagine his fingers touching your breasts. He's taking your dress off down your hips. Good. Lower. That's it. [shutter clicks] Feel, he knows just how to touch you. He's making you hot, excited. You can come in a minute. [shutter clicks] That's it. [sighs] It feels good. Move with it. [shutter clicks] He's behind you now. His lips are over your ear, telling you every nasty thing he's going to do to you. You feel him inside. You feel him getting harder. That's it. You're so hot, so excited. You could come now. What? Why are you stopping? What? JENNIFER: So, where the hell is he? LAUREN: It's only five after. I swear one of these days I'm going to kick his slick ass back across the Bay. [laughs] Jennifer. What is bothering you about Raul? He seems perfectly nice to me. He just-- I don't know. Ever since daddy let him start working with art collection, he acts like he knows something. Well, he's not dumb. No, but God, a few years ago he could barely speak English. And now he runs around our estate like he owns it. Daddy just promised him a piece of sculpture that's worth a small fortune. It's ridiculous. Look, I got to book, babe. Are you sure I can't help you? - No, it's OK. I'm sure he'll be here. Well, if he's not here in five would you let me know? I'll see you at Dad's Speak of the devil. [horn honking] LAUREN: Wait a second. Raul, where are we going? RAUL: You'll see in a minute. [horn honking] [inaudible] [speaking spanish] What did you say to them? I said, don't even think about it. [speaking spanish] Marissa? Here, ask her anything you want. She's perfect, perfect. The real thing, she's got it all. Talk about raw passion. The way she was on the roof. The look she had on her face when she lifted her skirt for that guy, if I can just get that on film. Of course Jennifer will have a fit, she's so high on Heidi. I'll use them both. Besides, once Jennifer sees her she's going to sing her up for life. As long as she shows up tomorrow. Oh, she'll be there. Yeah. OK. Thanks, Raul I owe you one. It's nothing. What? Nothing. I just have never seen you without your-- Nikon bag, I know. I feel naked without it. But I've got my little Canon right here. Wait, I have an idea. You'll be my date. Mrs. Hamilton. Lauren. Come on. [music playing] Come on. The guest of honor. Raul, [speaking spanish] I'm sorry we're late. Oh, as if cared. We simply started without you. You look exquisite. Thank you. Raul, are you joining us? Well, I couldn't show up without an escort, now could I? Oh, we'll just get another setting here. There you are. Thank you. I'll get another chair. Fine. Jennifer, we have found the perfect blue girl. You're going to love her, Jennifer I know it. JENNIFER: But, how can you tell? I saw her dance, if you could call it that. It was more like foreplay. I've never seen a woman taking so much pleasure in her own body, and in public. It was like nobody was there but her and her lover. And I wanted to talk to her, so we followed them. Then, they really started getting into it. Oh. Squeeze it right here. Did they know that you were watching them? No. But it looked like she was on fire. But she was still in control, taunting this guy. How do you mean? Well, she took down her dress, and she's teasing him with this magnificent body. And she's letting him kiss her, and then she's pushing him away. I mean, even when he got her panties off, she wouldn't let him go any further. It was like, not yet. He got so excited. It was like he was a slave. And then? Well, then finally, he took her from behind. STAN PERKINS: [laughs] That sounds my idea of a night out. Dining, dancing, and a show. [laughter] Daddy. You watched all this? LAUREN: I couldn't take my eyes off her. I couldn't take my eyes off her. Is this your husband? LAUREN: No, Mrs. Perkins, my husband isn't here. It's Raul, Mom. You remember. You make a lovely couple. LAUREN: Grandma, he's the chauffeur. STAN PERKINS: Mom, you remember Raul. Eduardo's son. [music playing] RAUL: I saw you looking at this in the cafeteria this afternoon Thank you. It's good with coffee. You want some more? Yes. I'd like one of those, too. [music playing] STAN PERKINS: This is an Indonesian piece-- from Bali, actually. They passed this technique down from generation to generation. See the detail work here? Amigo. A new shipment just came in. When can you work on it? I'll start this week. Thank you. Nice having you. [music playing] That's the collection. I'll show you. [music playing] Mr. P hired me to open crates when I was a teenager. It started as a few days work, but it turned into a full-time job. I got into the old man's passion. It's a private world of his. He opened the door for me, you know. And now I'm helping him organize the entire collection. Mr. P gave me this one. Beautiful. It's from the Pacific Rim. [inaudible] The silverfish lovers. This one-- he's a young fisherman who hunted silverfish. He found this cove where the fish lived No, stay there. Go on. Oh, you don't mind, do you? It's just for fun, for me. Go on. He found this cove where the fish lived. He was in the water. [shutter clicking] He had the fish cornered, with a spear raised. But he waited. He couldn't do it. And the full moon, seeing this, turned him into a fish. And they spent the night together in that cove. And the next day, the fisherman returned to his village with a beautiful maiden, with hair of shining silver. She only stayed with him until the next full moon, then she disappeared. The fisherman searched the river and the cove. He never found the silverfish. He never was able to hunt again. Wow, that's a beautiful story It's my turn. No, really. I'm better behind the lense. It's only fair. All right, you can take one. Focus with this. [shutter clicking] [laughs] My turn. [music playing] [shutter clicking] Now. - Mm mm. - Oh yes. Put your hand behind your shoulder. That's good. [shutter clicking] Move your fingers. Let's go on. [music playing] [moans] [music playing] [moans] [music playing] LAUREN: [moans] [music playing] [music playing] [dialing phone] [music playing] [dog barking] I'm sore. I'm sorry. Thank you. You're welcome. Oh, in the morning-- Yes? Could you come by a little earlier and help me with the equipment? Sure. It's going to be a long day tomorrow. And you're sure she'll show up-- Marissa? She'll be there. Sleep well. You too. [birds chirping] Mrs. Spencer, I'm ready for that omelet now. [music playing] [SINGING] Who do you love? Who do you love? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Who do you? Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby. [knocking] Good morning. I couldn't wait for you to come home. So, what? Aren't you going to invite me in? God, I'd forgotten how hot it would be down here. Whew. I knew you'd be surprised. But I was just kind of hoping for pleasantly surprised. Wow, this is nice. You should have called, Stephen. Ah, shoulda, coulda, woulda. Look, you're still a little upset. I think I still rated a little kiss. Just one? Stephen, I've got to get ready. [knocking] Ah, allow me Can I help you? It's Raul, Stephen. He works for the agency. Of course. Oh, how goes it? LAUREN: And he's here to help me with the equipment. And these must be from the agency. Yes, they are. How pretty. [phone ringing] I bet that's Jennifer now. Stephen, could you Absolutely, absolutely. I didn't know he was coming. We have to talk because-- [phone ringing] STEPHEN: Hello? Hey, yeah, I flew in this morning. Yeah, she was surprised. Hold on. Lauren, Jennifer wants to know if you-- if we need more time. No, we're on schedule so far. STEPHEN: No, no, no. Your manservant, Raul. The bags are over here, Raul, if you can take them downstairs. Certainly, Mrs. Hamilton. They're beautiful. STEPHEN: OK, we'll see you in a bit. [hangs up phone] Scrambled, lucky me. You don't mind, do you? [music playing] [SINGING] [moaning] I can see through this. I can feel it. And I can feel it in your kiss. I've felt this all before. Or maybe I read it wrong, but I can't wait that long. This love's weighing heavy on my heart, on my heart. I'll carry the weight of the world for your love for your love, all, the weight of the world. I just can't carry this love on my own. I can't carry this love on my own. Weight of the world, just can't carry this love on my own. I know you have a job to do. I just couldn't leave things unsettled between us. Well. I admit that I was wrong. Maybe it's all been too much for me. I was feeling a little threatened. You're just so good at everything you do. And for me to be with someone so talented, so smart, so damn beautiful-- well, a man just starts to feel-- Good, Stephen, blame me and flatter me at the same time. I'm not blaming you. I'm saying that I did what I did because of my own insecurities. It wasn't you, babe. As for this other totally inconsequential encounter-- LAUREN: It didn't mean anything. I know. I've heard this once before, Stephen. STEPHEN: I bought the Kornsby place. LAUREN: You what? STEPHEN: That's right, the entire 23 acres. You said that old barn would make a dream studio [laughs] Oh God, this is so like you. Something's wrong, so you just throw money at it. No, no, this is different. This is what you wanted. I did it for you, for us. So we could have a place, and the time to make a new beginning. All right, Stephen. You say that you want us to be there for each other. Well, that means all the time, not just want a crisis like this forces you to pay attention. Yes. Yes, absolutely. You know, these daytime assignments have done wonders for your self-esteem. I've never seen you so assertive. It's really attractive Stephen. A chance, that's all I'm asking for. Just say you'll think about it. All right? Come here, come here, come here. All right, Stephen, all right. [sighs] JENNIFER: Ahoy maties. Morning. Hi, cookie. LAUREN: Clifford, did you pack the extra umbrellas? You decided to work on your tan, eh? I do hope you brought some swimwear. Raul, you finally shaved. What's the occasion? So, where's wonder girl? She's supposed to meet us here. She's late. Where is she, Raul? I took your word on this. Well, who can you trust these days? Stop it. She'll be here. We've got to get this show on the road, babe. So we'll use Heidi. You won't even miss this flake of yours.

The guy I saw you with the other night, is he the same one that drove you here this morning? No. What? You think there's something wrong with that? LAUREN: No, no, I was just curious. Me too. I'm a curious person. And when I want to know something, I explore. Wow. I see. Whatever I want. What my heart needs, that's what I listen to. I go for the things I want, you know. I want to live every day all the way. I don't want any regrets when I'm old. You know what I mean? Huh? [thunder] [wind blowing] [thunder] STEPHEN: How about a little refreshment, huh? Woo. [laughs] LAUREN: Has anybody seen my camera bag? My bag's missing. Clifford, where's the Nikon? [sighs] Shit. You heard what he said, hon. We can't go back in the middle of this. It's not safe. It's too shallow. Screw this shit. I want a dinghy. All right, all right. He needs both of his crewmen up on deck. My shot is in that role, dammit. I'm not going to stand around here and do nothing. You just have to wait it out, sweetheart This should blow over within an hour. I'll send Raul after it the minute this lets up. I'd go back for you myelf, but I'm not familiar with those motors. JENNIFER: Lauren? Yes, yes, I hear you. JENNIFER: I'm with you, babe You better stay where you are for now. Kiefer says it's going to get worse before it lifts, and it's going to have a hell of a time getting you moored up [inaudible] again. So just stay put, will you? All right. We're lucky. You know, I was depending on you, Raul. And you just disappeared like that today. Listen, everybody else is into their own bullshit Raul, I would like to think that you and I could play it straight. Straight? Right. I'm sorry, OK. I'm sorry that Marissa went too far. I'm so sorry Stephen showed up. I'm sorry we haven't had two seconds to just talk to each other about what's happened. It meant nothing. It doesn't matter Raul, no What is there to talk about? You belong to him, right? You had an itch. You scratched it. Yeah. And now? It's over. It is over. Stop it. Don't. It doesn't matter, right? [music playing] [SINGING] More than a dream, closer than a shadow. I can feel you near. Oh something you're saying is touching me. There's a ringing in my head. All along I tried to prepare. Nothing comes close to how we feel when we're together. And when you touch me, I keep holding on. I pray forever is one day you'll come. It's more than words. Now that I found you, I'll never let go. I'll never let go. All of my nights Were empty and shallow, but now filled with tears. Ooh reach out and hold me, let your love control me till the river is here. Tonight I cure all our fears. I want you so much, I need to feel our hearts together. And when you touch me, I keep holding on. Hold on. I pray forever is one day you'll come. It's more than words. Now that I found you, I'll never let go. Ho ho. And when you touch me, I keep holding on. I pray forever is one day you'll come. It's more than words. Now that I found you, I'll never let go. I won't let go. Oh no no. And when you touch me, I keep holding on. RAUL: So, what now? Now you go back to your husband again? He says he's changed. Me, I don't have to change Oh, so I'd be better off with you, is that what you're saying? I can make you very happy Yes, for now. Is that all? You don't want more. I know you. Yeah, I do. What, you really want a future with me? I don't think so. You just like what's going on right now. And you? Forget about it. I'm completely confused. But I should thank you. Thank me? Yeah. You taught me something. You taught me how to just let myself be. And that's a freedom and a feeling I didn't even know existed. And you got me there. You got your shot. Yeah, and what did you get? What do you want, really? How long are you going to live like this. And don't give me, it's a good job. Well? Well, what? You could have so much more. Mrs. Hamilton, are you there? Mrs. Hamilton, are you there? Yeah. Is the camera OK? Ah, it survived. Good. The coast is clear. We're heading back in. OK, we're on our way. We better go. My silverfish. You got it? Great. JENNIFER: Yeah, I'm sure it was nothing. Look, that might be the kind of line you feed your wife. [inaudible] Hey, babe. We were just about to call out the Coast Guard. JENNIFER: Um, did you-- did you find the camera? Uh huh. STEPHEN: Quite a storm, huh? God, I missed you. I need to get out of these clothes. JENNIFER: Of course. Sure. I'll um-- I'm going to get Terry to pull one of the garment bags for you. LAUREN: No, I can manage. Don't. How you feeling? Fine. You look a little beat. I guess the extra trip overtired you. I thought it was a bit much, you and Raul, going in on your own like that. It was something you had to do. I understand that. [music playing] [laughs] Thank you Oh, you know the one across form the Biltmore? Oh, it's perfect for drinks. Terry, Marissa can come in your car. Mm, gracias. No, thank you, Marissa. You really made it happen. She certainly did. Now, you know, I can invest that for you and practically double it. Really, Marissa, this is only the beginning. Now, if you come with my agency, I can have you working whenever you want. No, thanks. One day with you guys is enough for me. I'm out of here. Hey, babe. Oh. JENNIFER: Can you believe this girl? Flake. What did I tell you? An absolute, total flake. Thank you. JENNIFER: Raul, is my phone still in the car? Well, then must still be on board. Honestly, I shouldn't even pay him for the day. He can't keep track of anything. Well, what are you waiting for? Go back on and get it. Get it yourself. JENNIFER: What? What did he say? You heard me. Look, I've had just about enough of this. No, I've had enough of you. I quit. And I'll turn in the keys to your father. JENNIFER: You slimey little-- STEPHEN: Hey, hey ignore him. It's been a long day. We'll go for a drink.

And where is it that you think you're going? I don't know, babe, but don't wait up. [engine starting] [music playing] [laughter] [music playing] [SINGING] More than a dream, closer than a shadow, I can feel you near. Ooh something you're sending is touching me.
