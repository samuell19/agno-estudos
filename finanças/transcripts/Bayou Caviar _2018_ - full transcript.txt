And what do you think should happen to the people who did this to you? I think that's for others to decide. I don't believe in being angry. I like to focus on the positive and stay in the here and now. Paging Dr. Healey. Room 305. Dr. Smith, front-desk. You have some nerve coming here. Is there some place you want me to set these?

I had to be in his camp in order to put myself on the right side of politics. Don't give me that bullshit, R.J. I took you out of the street, raised you, taught you right from wrong in and out of training. You had more balls and talent than any fighter I had ever seen. Those scumbags from they knew that.

He's learning every aspect of the business, thanks God. Yes. - Thanks God. - No, I must decline. You will save the celebration for when you have better counsel. No, my friend... I will never have better counsel, wiser counsel than you. Your suggestion of transition, it makes me feel vulnerable. I would never want you to feel such things. I would hope not. But don't let me worry you, my friend. We will do our best to see that your son-in-law, Isaac is a great asset to our team. So, you go home, you rest, and there will be much work for you to make this transition to your son-in-law work. You are a blessing from God. Thank you, thank you, thank you, my friend.

Yes, whatever, man. You need to get your shit together, Rodney. I'll always be his father, Amber. No matter what you do.

Hey, Rodney, we saw you take the 154 pound, though back at NSG in the day. Yes, you took out one of our own boys. - What was his name? - Motherfucking Pedro Martinez. Pedro Martinez. What happened to him? Champion took him down in two. We let him go. Yeah. What happened to you? I got interested in other things. Have you ever been to a crocodile farm before today, Rodney? Amazing animals. They not only provide the service. God has blessed me. I own a village of grateful and loyal people. You've done very well for yourself. Have you given a thought to how difficult it is to dispose of a dead body? It's the first thing a smart person should think about is how to get rid of a newly dead body. And the consensus is that you have to chop up the corpse into separate pieces. You pile them together and that's where the alligators come in. Get the pen open. 50 gators. They can ravage a human body in seconds. I once saw they ate a whole carcass of a cow, completely. Hooves, tails, flesh, fur. This... This is what they call down here, Louisiana caviar. Beluga. Go on. come here. So, you work for me now, okay? I don't know if I was in a position to refuse. I suppose you're not. His name is Isaac Shinto. I want you to get me something on him. You know, I keep on having these dreams of Mark dying. I wake up disappointed. Disappointed? Well, kill the fucker. Not that easy. I do want kids and Mark is a good guy. Yeah, whatever. That's what they all say? Homemade is ready? No, not yet, sweetheart. Why don't you swing by tomorrow afternoon? Good to see you again. Be careful, it's hot. Nicole Brogan photography? Rodney, here. I should have died today, but I didn't die. I got saved. I think it was a sign. A sign for what? Change. I'm going to need your cameras. - For what? - I haven't figured that out yet, but basically, I got to get this Isaac guy doing some bad things. What kind of bad things? Told you, I haven't figured that out yet. You got a camera that makes movies? You mean a video camera? I'm going to need you to film it. Fuck that. Borrowing my shit's one thing, I do this, I'm implicated. I don't care. I'm not asking you. Is that a threat, Rodney? Nicky, I need this. Fuck you. Yes, that sounds about right. Is that him? Yeah, that's him. Oh, lord, it's hot. I've come to offer you a deal. I just saw you turn off the lights, I can see you in there. Come on. I'm starting eviction proceedings immediately, that's it. There's no going back. These fucking deadbeats. It's my father in law, I don't know why I'm doing this. Chase these fucking deadbeats, I can't believe this. Come on, damn it. All these fucking deadbeats. Shit. Hey. Hey, do you live here? Yeah, what the fuck are you doing here? Oh, I... One of my kids I teach, he must have gave me the wrong address. Yeah? What are you doing laundry? Staying cool. Uh-huh. That's how you stay cool? Yeah. You want to grab a coffee? Yeah, I'd like that. What does your mind say to you? Shoot, son. Why aren't you commentating on Showtime? Why didn't you get on one of them reality shows when everybody still knew who your ass was? But I'm a fighter. I don't let that shit in, I stay focused on the positive. You know. Let me show you this book my stepfather gave me. - Yeah? - Yes, it scientifically proves that everything you think in your brain determines what happens in real life. Kind of like how a seed makes a plant, but you got to be clean with your thoughts, otherwise, you know, shit gets confused. That's why I always try to articulate exactly what I want. I want my own reality show, I want to be a YouTube star, And I want my own jewelry line. Yeah, well... Thought may be the seed, but action is the rain. You feel me? I like that. You got big knuckles. They've been broke so many times, I can't even... They don't even touch no more. What? Why? That's just how it is. - Mine are bigger. - Yeah, they are. Mine are blacker. Listen, man, you can never stop. Ain't nothing to it, but to do it, just got to do. - Hear me? - Yes, I know. - I network. - That's good. - I read all the magazines. - That's it. Never stop the hustle. The only ones who become famous are willing to do whatever it takes. Yeah. Yeah, like Kim and Ray J. They made a sex tape. That was some crazy ass shit. I don't know, I think she looked beautiful in it. I never saw it. It's not like I watched it on a loop or anything. You sure? Yeah, I'm sure. - Nasty ass. - Fuck you. I just think that she's the ultimate example of a success story, you know? You ever think you'll do something like that? Sex tape? I don't know, I wouldn't know how. I got this girl that actually organized a sex tape for another celebrity. No fucking way. Way, fucking way. You ain't bullshitting me? No, I never mess with another person's opportunity. You really think I'd be good at something like that? I don't know. Why? Would you? You know this is crazy talk. I got to bounce anyway. I've got a lot of shit to do. Alright. Thank you for the coffee. Anytime, pretty lady. - Hit me later. - Alright. Rodney, fucking Jones. Meet Julio. Honor to meet you, champ. Part of our stable. Bring him along like chandelier, always very proud. In fact, he'll win the title belt in two years, guaranteed. Congratulations. - How you feeling? - Good. I think I found a solution to that situation Yuri spoke of. It involves an under-age tenant of Isaac's. Boy or girl? Girl. A boy with a vendetta. Honey, they're here. Put this on the table. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Your mom, go to your mother right now, please. welcome, welcome, welcome. Oh, my God, you're huge. I hope you didn't do the cooking. I had to bring in the chicken. I'm a waiter now. Place looks nice and clean. Thank you. Well, we got the cleaning lady you wanted. - Yours, of course. - Good. She's good. Yes, she's very good. Please sit. How's your back? It's like the weather, It's unpredictable. How's Yuri? He's good. Is that your first one today? Only fools drink the way you do. Doesn't it say in Tehillim that God protects fools? When they're righteous. Even those in bed with criminals, I guess. What is this you say? God has given you many blessings. I mean no disrespect. I'm very grateful to be part of this family. - I didn't mean anything... - Be careful not to judge too harshly, my son. We have a good life. Ours is not the first family to do Russian business. After the fall of the Soviet Union you had half a million Russians, Jews... I was thinking about what you asked me earlier. What? The celebrity video stuff? Yeah. I remember that. Would you really introduce me to your girl? We already talked about you. I said to her, I said: "This girl is almost too fine." You didn't say that. I did say that. My girl Nic said that: "if we do it, though, we should have an angle, hidden videotape shit." You mean like not telling the person who I'm having sex with? I guess it's more cache when we approach TMZ. TMZ? Yes. It's going to be real good for you, girl. It's going to be real good. - Whoa, woah, slow down, B. - Why? We still got a lot to do here. I know, I ain't worried. I know you got me, Rodney. Always, we're family. That's on everything. Whoa, whoa, hey, whoa. You can't... If we do this, we can't tell anybody. At least not until we approach my contact at TMZ. Okay. I really want this for you. You really are something. You look fierce. Even my stepdads' heard of you. A long, long time ago, baby girl. When I turn 18, I want to get an apartment on my own, and bat that shithole. And get an agent or something? You know that there's nothing to it, but to do it. Yeah, it's time to start thinking about my future. For sure. - It's good. - You like that? Uhm. You really do look cute when you smile. Really? Actually no, not cute, ladylike. No one's ever called me a lady before. Pretty lady. Oh, shit, did I wake you? Don't stop. Don't stop. Happy is the one that dwells in the house of God. You ask: "What is he so happy about?" Because in the house of God he has no challenges, none. You want to pray? There's three services a day. Thank God. You want to eat? We have kosher food downstairs, a dairy, and a meat kitchen. You want to learn Torah, You want to learn Talmud. The Levens and Shemto family have donated a handsome, handsome donation to the synagogue to build our base midrash. Unbelievable. Yo, you know how much it cost to fix my website? Guess. 1200 dollars. Where the fuck am I supposed to get that from? I don't give a shit, it's on. What's on? Okay, let's try one more time. A little to your left. Okay, great. Up, up, up. Go down on your knees. Yeah, OK, perfect. That's your spot. That's where you want to land. Oh, could you take off your top for a sec? My top? Yeah.

One last time. Thank you. Oh, hey. Hey. Is your mom or stepdad home? No, they're at the doctor's. Your mom sent me an email saying she'd be here with the two months' rent. Yes, I think they left it for you. Come in. Do you want something to drink? No. A little early, wouldn't you say? Yes, well, no one drinks it here anyways. This is nice. How much did it cost? Rent. Yes, let me grab that for you. You know, I can't seem to find it. Yes, it's disgusting. Stop. Please? You're going to get that? Sweetness. Everything good? Okay. Can I call you back in one second? I'm with the tenant. Alright. Holy shit, holy shit. What the fuck? What a fucking looser. Maybe he likes to suck dick. Who is it? It's Isaac. Go get him. Who represents you in theatrical? What do you mean? In on the bid? Well, you should be. I should be? Well, I mean, I am. I'm just, you know, getting started and shit, you know? Did I look good on camera? You just looked amazing. Your acting was great too. Totally believable. Got headshots? Well, that's what I do when I'm not doing this. Can't get anywhere in this town without a headshot. Not to boast, but women and men request me from all over the country. That's cool. You must get laid a lot? You got a hot ass. Yeah, you think so? I do. Alright. - Let me see it? - Okay. What is that? You just can't come into my room like that. - Your mother wants you. - Okay. - Well, get the fuck out. - Your mom wants you? Okay. Did she say why? She didn't say why. Listen, I know I'm only your stepfather. - You know you say that sometimes. - Yeah. But, , when a boy gives you a gift, it's either from the heart or from the testicles. My abuelita used to say that, so it's very important. - Okay. - It's important Alright. Now get the fuck out. - Okay? - Yes. Who said anything about a goddamn gift? Okay. Looks pretty good, right? Yeah. When did they tell you the DVD? I don't know, two-three days. Perfect. Good. I mean, it was surreal. I felt in control. You know. Yah, wow. And what now, is Rodney blowing you off yet? What? You'll see, and I hope you use protection. Of course I use protection, of course. My mom has a friend, who has a daughter who was dating this loser and they made a tape. When they broke up, he put it all over the Internet. Millions of people saw it. Anybody can see it still if they want to. She had to switch schools. Yeah, well Rodney is not a loser, so... I know he wouldn't do that to me. Oh, my God, what is this? I take this thing off. Ew. What does it... Put it on your head, wait, let's see. Hello. Hey, did you get my text? Yeah, listen I'm just crazy with clients. But I didn't forget about you, baby girl. I was going to call. Yeah, but you didn't. You're right, my bad. Make it up to me. Hey, listen, I got take this. Can I call you right back? Alright. Bye, baby. So, what do you say? 16, fuck me! I need you to make me a copy. Why? Better you not know. - I could go to jail for this shit. - You won't. She has a complete disregard for my involvement now. I've taken care of Nicki. I just need the video by Monday. - Monday is too soon. - You said two or three days. - You know what? This shit takes time. - I don't give a shit. My people are expecting it by Monday. - Fuck me. - That's right, that's right. And if my people don't get it by Monday, I have problems. If I have problems, you have problems. Fucking Monday. - Hi, there. - What are you doing here? What do you mean what am I doing here? I'm here to see you. I know. Just you surprised me. I didn't know you was coming, I'm sweaty and shit. You're blowing me off now? No, no. God bless. I'm walking out. Next time I'll invite you. You just surprised me, so. Kind of seems like... No. You know I'm good for you, right? Yes, of course. It's just, you know, I've got a lot of stuff I'm dealing with right now. I don't understand how you can be so kind to someone one day and then not give a fuck about them the next. I'm sorry. You're right, I'm sorry. You want to take care of my little penis? Yeah. See that, you agree with me. I made this for you. What? It's a necklace. It's beautiful. I'll wear it like a bracelet, though. Put it over my wraps. - What? - I'm sweaty, you know. This is cool, though. How many copies of the video we made? There's a problem, it didn't record. Must have been a mistake in the transfer, a video glitch or something. - What do you mean? - What I said. It just didn't record. So, you don't have to worry about it. - Fuck you, Rodney. - Hey. - Get the f... No. - Come on. Time will make everything better. Life is about the journey, not about the incident at the moment. What's important, is that you learn the lesson. I'm not going to be a real actress now. I want to get married and have kids, but no one wants to marry the girl that was in the porno. Before this is over and done, Shlomo will answer to this. You're not listening. We set him up. It's every single porn site in the world that we need to worry about now. I thought you said this was for his business? I mean, that's what he said, but I don't know. I don't know. We need to go to the police. We can't. Rodney works for the Russian mafia. I hope you've learned your lesson. This is the girl that shot it. Maybe she still has it. Yes, yes. Right there. Oh, my God. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Right there. You coming. Yes. Yes. What's happening? I cannot believe you let that girl do those things. What the fuck are you talking about? I saw your fucking computer. Shit. Shelly! Shelly! Fuck. Shelly!

I'm just in a fucking - tight spot, alright. - You're not going to like this shit either. Time, time, time. Work with it. You said Monday. - There was a fuck up. - You remember your boy Rafi? He was a fuck up too. I'll fix it. It's what you hired me for. What the fuck do you mean, you'll fix it? It was supposed to be done. How is your throat feeling? How do you think it's feeling? Do you know, Kat was chosen for the program at the school, to go to Washington? If I find out there's something going on between the two of you, I swear I'll cut off that useless cock of yours. You think I'm stupid? I see the way you look at her. Why do you make everything so ugly? You started it by marrying me for a green card. That's fraud. I could have you deported. - Excuse me. - How could you do those horrible things to this little girl? I don't know what you're talking about. There's a video. Look, what do you want? I want $100,000 dollars in cash. I have $40,000 dollars as my whole life savings. Please, I have a family. Where were they when you were filming this video? That's him, right? Yes, that's him. Okay, here's the plan. We get him in the alley, Tina will approach him, grab at his crotch and then drop to her knees. I know it might look delicious, but what if he's not responsive? - He won't be. - What? Just please... just, sweetheart, stick to the plan. Nic will be taking as many photos as she can get. Hopefully she gets something. Honey, this all seem like a lot of work to me. Why don't you just jump back here and I'll suck both of those dicks for half - what you already gave. - You ain't sucking my dick. Okay. Please, we'll all just stick to the plan, okay? Alright, boo. What's he doing? What's he doing? He's approaching some Hispanic-looking guy. I don't do Mexican, y'all. Handing him a bag. Now he's taking something out of the bag. A computer? My computer. The Mexican just gave that dude my computer. Oh, shit! Did you see that? That's so cold ass nigga. Oh, my God. You's are cold ass niggas. Get out! Is the footage there? Is the footage there? I'm checking. Yes! Oh, fuck me. - It's all good. - Okay. - Oh, my God. - You see what this is? Right there. That's a nasty motherfucker. - Yeah. - Frying in the sun going down. You think you're being punished now? Try a break without God. Get in there, Julio, Get in there! Get in there, Julio. Come on, get in there! That's it. That's it. Two discs and a flash drive. Three separate copies. - I got another job for you. - No, thanks. This kids' going to be a champ. - Good for him. - Good for you too. What do you want me to train him now? He's untapped gold, man. I can give you lead on some good people. Fuck your leads, nigga. I want you on deck until the fight. - I can't. - I wasn't asking, nigger. That video was fucking late. Or you expect us to pay for late? Or you can just sue me and the people I work for. Let's see how that works out for you. You're going to get a couple rounds. Champ. Come on Julio, stick it, man, get in there. Get in there! Double him up. Come on, double him up. Dear Kat, please understand that me leaving has nothing to do with you. It's between your mom and me. You are beautiful and smart. And you will have a life blessed by Jesus. You just have to believe that it will come true. And remember what I tell you, life is like a garden, good seeds make good trees. That is why I paid for your first year at Valley College. Here is some cash to help with the books and expenses. I'm so glad you called me. Yeah, I remembered what you said. Can't get anywhere in this town without a headshot, right? That's right. Remind me to introduce you to my buddy Brett Mehlman. His sales are pretty huge. He produces the crew, we're tight. Definitely take a meeting with you. You should be like my manager or something. Wow, you have the most amazing lips. Thank you. I've only seen this kind of combination of sexy and maturity in a few girls, both major actresses now. Really? Yeah. You could be a real find. Do you really think you can help me find an agent? Maybe we can help each other. Alright, sweety, just eyes to camera. Just close your eyes for one sec and tilt your head slightly to the right. Now open your eyes. Oh, perfect. Give me a little smile. There you go. There you go. Move, move, move, move! Get out of the corner. Get out of the fucking corner! That's it, get your hands up, son. There you go. Come on man. Why do you got to do all of this shit? We keep going through the fucking sparring partners, man. Yes, but I'm saying how are we going to keep these guys together, you keep working through them. All I'm saying is, Julio, you're going to get good, but you got to fucking take it easy sometimes. You can't be 100% the whole time. Is that my nigger Rodney Jones? Hey, what's up, champ? Listen, do you see the bling, right? So, you know I ain't no secret in this motherfucker. Yeah, I don't see no bodyguards today, though. Shit, money, you're still in the game? God damn! Yes, he's the trainer for Julio Mendaro. March 29, Showtime. It's going to be a great fight, champ. - We'll have money promotions. - Yeah, you know me and your trainer here, we was in the Olympics together. Do you remember Dianne from track and field, right? He's gonna brave that. You remember when I used to stop you in the second round of sparring, right? You peed yourself, that left hook. Now, you're pushing it too far, yeah, you're pushing it too far now. Yes, you're pushing it just a little bit too far. Now you're Dr. Seuss, you're going to write - a make believe story? - I wish your hands moved as fast as your mouth does. I tell you what, whatever you want to do, we can do, Money. However you want to get it. - Ain't nothing between us but air and opportunity. - And that big ass beard, - you ought to shave that too. - All mighty arms brazing - is we're going there, however you want to do. - Really, you wanna come up here and talk that shit? Or maybe I'll come down there to your black ass nigger. That's why you always walk around with motherfucking bodyguards. Get your ass out of this gym. Come on champ. - Get the fuck off me. - Come on, champ. Alright, let's go. Let's get this money. You just keep training them undercard niggas. Love money productions. Love money, baby. Love money. Hope don't float, Rod! That was really, really great. What's your name? - What? - I'm going to need you to sign a release. It's the third time she's called. Hello? - Hey, girl. It's Nic. - Hi. What's up? Where are you? Just at the pool with my friends, right now. Are you coming over today? I can't, I'm busy right now, you know. Oh, Okay. Well, so let's do tomorrow, what time? Could you just mail them to me actually? - Mail them? - Yeah, I just don't think I have a lot of time. Well, then I wouldn't get to see you, so... I mean, don't you want me to help you with still getting an agent and stuff? I mean, Yeah, I do but... Alright, look, I'm just trying to help you out here, alright? Now you're acting like a bitch for no reason. Fuck, I'm not... I'm not treat... No, I'm not. You know what? I usually charge a lot of money for this shit. I don't know where you get off treating me like this. I'm not treating you any way. Yes, whatever. Got to go. Fucking cunt. Fucking douchebag. You worthless piece of shit. That fucking cunt. Fuck you both. What have I done? You know, for a guy not paying rent you've got a lot of complaints. No, no, no this is something else. - Come on. - What? Oh, my God, Aah, aah, aah, aah. I've dealt with cases like this before. I can have it pulled down, okay? These sites, they hey, they don't have to hassle, trust me, okay. You can trust me, yes? I got you. Yes, I know that video. I wrote the caption myself. People are loving it, over 7000 hits. My name is Benjamin Cantor and I'm a lawyer and my client who appears in that video clearly did not give his consent. We insist that you take it down immediately. Then I'll take it down you just need to pay your standard $750 removal fee. Removal fee? For something you have no right to put up in the first place? I don't think you understand who you're messing with here. My client is close with the mayor, okay? And I see that you are registered in the state of Louisiana, do you really want to mess with someone who has the mayor on speed dial. Don't tell me my rights, Mr. Cantor, I know them better than you do. Of course, you do. Where do I sign the cheque? - Too late. - What? That offer is no longer on the table. - What? - Yeah. I'm gonna need to call you back. Hey, Larry, Hey, you're still working for that gossip site? Yeah, I've got something for you. There he is. Rabbi! Rabbi! Police now confirm that the girl in the Isaac Shamptov video is a minor? I have no comment. Will you return the money his family has donated? - No! - Will you at least go on record - condemning his actions. The victim was a child. - I'll go on record that we're not returning the money, affirmative. So, who is Isaac Shamptov? Married to the daughter of the president of the Masa real estate company, with almost a billion dollars in holding, they're a huge donor to the mayor reelection campaign with president Shlomo Levinson sitting on the city's Real Estate Council. He's also a prominent member of the ultra-orthodox community. Marlene Webb reporting from... Kat, get in in here. Police are at the door. What should I do? Coming. Don't touch me. - Are you Isaac Shamptov? - Yes. Alright, come on down. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney one will be provided to you. Do you understand these rights I've just read to you? Keep in mind these rights. Do you feel any remorse? Did you know she was underage? Daddy! Sorry about your son-in-law. I had a bad one too, you know. It hurts. So, is there anything I can do? Thank you, Yuri. I'm too old for this. You need to rest. I just can't do this anymore. You get some rest and then we talk about the future, because you see, my friend, this is simply not up for discussion. I would hate that your 11 grandchildren would have to see what you're doing here. Oh, God no. No, no. Fuck you, let go of me. Motherfucker. Jesus. Help! Help me, somebody! Stop it, let go. I should have protected her. It's just all too much. It's not true. I knew that manager. He was a scumbag, ruined many a young fighter. R.J. let me explain something to you. Any trainer can train a fighter, but it ain't many trainers who can make a fighter. I knew everything you could and couldn't do. I never had a father. I never had anybody looking out for me in my corner. Only one that ever gave two shits about whether I lived or died, was you. I never had a father either, kid. Thing that hurts most is I've never had a champion. See you finally wearing a belt and all the credit go to that bull shit trainer, just about killed me. I'm the one that made you. I know. Nurse, nurse, nurse! You ain't been to the gym in a while, bro. That's why I like you so much, Mr. Johnson. You have a rare sense of perception about how things have to be. Celebrity. It's such a funny thing. It not only sheds light on things that you never thought was relevant... and yet it allows you to feel so differently about the way things end up. Look at you. Top of the world. All along, not a care. And yet, in this photo, you can see all the scars. You can see how happy you are to have endured all that abuse. Great warriors must pray for a life of violence. Not only does it give them a chance to compete, it allows them this incredible self-absorption. Curiosity to see how much abuse you can really take. Violence for a great warrior, violence is their God. However... Bring her inside. Bring her. Bring her inside. Get the car. What do you think of this hotel they put us up in? It's nice. Nice? Girl, why you're acting all bougie? You know you ain't never been to a Ritz-Carlton before. I need a five, ladies. Yeah, I guess you're right. Alright, we're still rolling. If I may, I'd like to talk about the fact that even though this video was shot when you were underage, you're now currently 18, is that correct? Yes. New Orleans native Rodney Jones was a 2004 silver medalist winner in Athens, Greece. At 21, he turned professional and compiled a 41-5 record capturing three titles in three different... Do you think justice was Served And If so, do you feel there should be some sort of concession afforded to you for your involvement in this sordid ordeal? I think that's for others to decide. I don't believe in being angry. I have to focus on the positive and stay in the here and now. What was your relationship like with Rodney Jones? We're friends. Was it an intimate relationship? What do you mean? Rodney was a 38-year-old man and you were a 17-year-old girl who had intercourse with him. No. No, what? I wanted to... But he said that I was his guardian angel. So, you never had sex with him? No. I know what he did was wrong. It's something I'll have to live with the rest of my life, but I have no hatred towards him. My life changed that day. It's almost like he passes his fighting spirit to me. Well, I can only pray that you find peace in healing. Thank you. - Here we go, Kat. - Come on, Kat. Come on, Kat. - Let me see that smile. - Here we go, girl. - Where is that smile? - You know you got it, girl. That lipstick is... You know she's my friend, right? Do you feel safer now that Isaac Shamptov has been sentenced? No comment on that. I like to focus on the positive. On my new show, the crew Fx, Thursdays at 9:00. Are you excited about your upcoming Ellen appearance? Yes, I am actually. It's always been a dream of mine to be on that show, so... I... Yes. I guess that's what life's all about, right? Starts with a dream. I remember when he were a champ. Yeah, now, he gets his back side wiped by your sorry ass once a week. You know I have a gentle touch. You don't hear him complaining. It's a shame how a black man can rule a world one day then be trapped in a shell the next. Yes, indeed. But it's not like we haven't seen anything before. No, but this one was something special. Yes, he's looking a little special today. I saw his brother in Madison Square Garden. Brother got hand speed. - Yes. - Yes, yes, yes. Blood pressure is good. I think, yes. Subtitles by explosiveskull
