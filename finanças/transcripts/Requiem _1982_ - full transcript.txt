- You were great! - Wow! - How the hell did you do that? - I have no idea. I saved my energy for the last stage. You were amazing! - What is your destination again? - Constanța. - Constanța... Where is that? - On the shore of the Black Sea. Black Sea... It will be superb. Oh my God. I've never been there before. - Me neither. - One moment, pardon. Well, your prayers were answered. A husband like this... Hmm! The doctor comrade must be very dashing, and he's very handsome, too. I saw him when he was waiting for you. And to top it all he could acquire a private passport. Not many can do this! How did he do that? Must the radio be so loud, Icuka? Valuska! Please turn off the radio, our dear guest finds it annoying. Thanks! These choral works... Let me tell you... Like someone whacked me with an axe. - Where's Marika? - She didn't come. I'm Terus. - Sit down, please. - I'd rather wait. Don't wait. She won't arrive. Not today, tomorrow. Never. I don't get it. I made an appointment with her. She told me that she'll be here. Is she sick again? Or perhaps her daughter has something again? She was fired. Yesterday. - Effective immediately. - Why? Someone rang her doorbell last week, at night. Her husband was taken away. He worked for the Interior Ministry, and... Thanks to her husband? That's why she was fired? I... I didn't say that. I didn't say that at all! adapted by Zoltan Fabri based on Istvan Örkeny's short story Music Cinematography Directed by In memoriam Istvan Hannover Born in Budapest in 1917 Died in Vac penitentiary, in 1951. Who's that? I'm looking for Dr. Agoston. Who? Gyula Pelle. He's not at home yet. - When will he arrive? - I'm not sure. Why didn't you turn on the light in the stairway? I couldn't find the switch. Come back tomorrow. He's on leave from tomorrow. But he takes the afternoon train. You can talk with him in the morning. Is this your habit that you don't look people in the eye? What is this in regard to? I can't tell you. - Then come back tomorrow. - That is not possible. A truck will leave to Csorna at dawn. To my parents. - I will wait for him. - Where? Somewhere. Bye. What were you thinking? You'll wait in the stairway? My husband would blame me for that. If it's so urgent... then please come in! Sit down, please. You can find some books above the fireplace. Why don't you take a seat? Poor fellow. It is most certainly painful. That port-wine stain on his face... You must be prepared for little guys, pests. They'll be looking for you. If they're around, don't be afraid, let them in. My address has been passed from hand to hand for 15 years by those who got into trouble. It has been like this since I first represented a communist in court. I was willing to take the cases of the disadvantaged free of charge. Nowadays, they want to meet me for a number of other reasons. Some come from the countryside and ask me to remove their fathers' names from the Kulak-list. Some come from the factory and ask for help because they have theatrical ambitions. Or... escapees from correction facilities who want to clear their criminal records. There's always some who don't have enough money, but need help. There's a lot of people who are helpless. This is the first thing you have to learn. You must not leave a trace behind yourself. Never ever. You have to memorize your lines. You have to burn the paper. Under all circumstances. Never forget to burn the paper. That is Rule One. You must remember that, all right? Why are you so concerned with what I do with my fingers? Not too long. Lasted about ten minutes perhaps. You should have heard the never-ending applause! It rumbled and went on for minutes! The air was wavering in the heat. The eyes were almost glowing. People were hollering at each other. They were pattering with their feet. That would have been enough. That... would have been enough for everyone. You must be hungry after your long journey. What journey? Well, it was just a thought. You should eat it before it turns cold. Take off your jacket, and put it on the chair. Sit down and eat! Oh my god! He eats in the same manner. The way he holds the fork. The way he chews the mouthful. I know already how he's going to reach for the glass! How he's going to drink. Oh my god. Will he wipe his mouth like that with the napkin? Here, have some fruits. Thanks, but no. Why are you so anxious? Why do you think that I'm anxious? Why can't you get rid of your horrible habit? Don't do it, please! Sorry. I neither want to see nor hear anything about her because you were talking about your mother. Yes. Sorry. You have no idea what a loud applause it was! It rumbled and went on for minutes! It seemed like it would never end! It was the problem of course. I couldn't have said anything else, I had to say that, only that, because that is the truth! Who's that? I'm looking for Dr. Agoston. - Who? - Gyula Pelle. - He's not at home. - When will he arrive? I'm not sure. Why didn't you turn on the light in the stairway? Oh my god! That woman has some nice legs... Those red nails... can drive you crazy! I could hardly stop kissing her legs on that first boat trip. I laid my head on her ankle and fell asleep. She had beautiful legs. What's so good about a woman's leg? I came to realize its importance on that day. I had hated my own leg up until then. I had felt that the leg had been a corrupted thing. The reason behind that was my mother's leg. I remember it as a dreadful thing. I was still a kid. Whenever she came home from the canteen, she started to remove some skin from her leg with a broken razor blade- What is this cacophony? Have you arranged a party or something? It's past 10 PM. Shut up! Mom's leg symbolized our whole misery. Deep blue thick veins ran through her leg intricately. It looked like maggots were crawling underneath. Jesus Christ! Pal... Why do you have to be so specific? It's like you were talking about my wife. I'm only teaching this kid. He ought to know a thing or two about life. Yeah. I lost interest in women and everything carnal because of her. Including my own body. We should have felt sorry for her of course. She was the one who stood at the counter all day and poured the draft beer. We still couldn't feel sorry for her, though. Whenever she came home, she was smelling of rum. She brought home half-drunk guys almost every night. I strove vainly to hide under my blanket. I saw everything. I lay there, clenched my teeth and cracked my knuckles as I was trying not to hear what was happening. What about your father? He remained silent? We didn't have a father, laddie. As yet, I've never met him. Same goes for my sister and brother. Ill weeds grow apace. I was 14 when I ran away. And when... Attention! I respectfully report that cell no. 154 contains 3 inmates! - Istvan Hannover. - Yes Sir! - Interrogation, you loud mouth! - Understood! - Pelle, son! - Yes Sir? Who do you have to look at? At the person who's entitled to give orders, Sir! You see? You know that. In case of recurrence you will receive punishment. Understood! You should hurry up, Hannover! I was a grown up. 20-22. The presence of a girl gave me the creeps. What about Netti? Don't be stupid! - Not even in the beginning? - Never. She was full of femininity. It was like... everything became prettier nearby. The street where she walked. The basin without enamel where she washed her body. Everything. Move, kid! Move, don't you hear me? The prisoner can pop in any time! If someone dares to fall in love with her he will never escape. The rapture which radiates from her turns into passion like alcoholism. As long as women like her exist, Earth will be full of slaves. You didn't expect this from the regional secretary, did you? Here we go again! Fuck you, man... How many more times do I have to listen to you bullshitting about being in the Party? If you're a big shot why did your comrades throw you here? Why don't they visit you? Why don't they come here and say that they are sorry? Idiot. Last time, you told me that Netti had always been faithful. In her own way. But she fooled my best friend. She would fool you too. She couldn't even look at me. Why? Because you have a scar on your face? Are you out of your mind? Your main problem is your shyness. You don't dare to love women. However, it's much easier to get a sexy woman than an ugly one. Beauty believes in its own mission. Like saints, who thought they could heal the lepers. Were you a leper too? Worse than that. I was a virgin when I was 26. I was sick and she was the healer, you know. Do you know what her voice was like? How should I know? I'm only familiar with your reminiscences. It's like Jascha Heifetz would play a viola. Her tread was like that of a deer. Even better. Maybe the gazelle runs like she does. Her skin, her breast, her belly... Like in the Bible. The "Song of Songs". "How beautiful are your feet in sandals, O prince's daughter!" "The curves of your hips are like jewels," "Your navel is like a round goblet." "Your belly is like a heap of wheat fenced about with lilies." "Your two breasts are like two fawns." Her kiss made me disappear completely. She could melt me with her kiss. I could cuddle with her till I blacked out. It was the least she could do. - Why do you do this? - What? That you jump and stand at attention when I come in. Sorry. You must be hungry after your long journey. What journey? Well, it was just a thought. You should eat it before it turns cold. I'm surprised. Why did she bring me an omelette? Why is she so friendly? She has no idea how awful it is when someone's gazing at you. She won't take her eyes off me! I'm always bloody anxious when someone's watching me. Especially when I eat. Especially when a woman does that. The fork is trembling in my hand because she's staring at me unceasingly! Why is she staring at me? How do you hold that wretched fork? A refined person doesn't hold the fork at the neck like that! State Security. We're looking for Istvan Hannover. This must be a misunderstanding. This is not his apartment. I have a committal order, and a perquisition order. It refers to this apartment too. Open the door, please! Nothing. - Are you Mr. Hannover? - Yes. I can arrest you according to the warrant. Here, take a look at this. Only from there! Don't come closer! I'm sorry, but this must be a funny misunderstanding. I'm the regional youth secretary. We don't care about your civil profession. If you're Istvan Hannover - yes, you are - then you must come with us. Comrades! Fulfil your duty! Dress Hannover! Don't you get it? What the hell is going on? - Who's that? - A good friend. Who are you looking for? I brought a message from the Vac penitentiary. Good afternoon, Miss. I was... in the penitentiary hospital with Pista. Only for three days, but... They sent him there, and... on the third night, he died, poor soul. That's not true. But yes. Sad but true. When did he die? Six months ago. On 18 November, at night. - Poor Pista... - Who are you? - Gabor Halasz. - You're a liar! You're provoking me... get lost! I'm sorry for disturbing you. Why do you think that I'm a liar? How can you prove that you brought me Pista's message? - Are you familiar with his handwriting? - Yes. Here. This is your address. He had written it before the day he died. Before the day he died... Oh my god. Pista died more than six months ago. More than six months... Terrible. What was his illness? Don't ask me. I'm unable to answer. Poor Pista... you know, before his death, well, he had known that it was a possibility so, before it occurred... So, when I'm set free I should come here and give you his... last message... No, pardon me, he didn't say that it was his last message, that's me, because the message refers to Dr. Agoston. Dear, do you take care of that boy? Pista said it's very important. I do my best. Just do it. "You can never tell" says G. B. Shaw. "You can never tell", sure. But it might be rewarding. 18 November at night. More than six months ago. Can I offer you a beer? No, thank you. Listen, are you familiar with Hungarian poetry? Well... I know some poems. From Ady, Babits, Attila Jozsef. Could you recite a poem? Any poem will do. Once you set foot on this earth, Your mother gives you seven births! Once in a blazing house afire, once in an icy flood's cold mire, once inside a loony bin, once amidst waving wheat so thin, once in cloister's hollow eye, once among pigs in sty. All six cry, it's not enough, son, Be yourself the seventh one! But why did you ask me? You were in prison along with Istvan Hannover. - How do you know? - In the Vac penitentiary? - Yes. - How long? One year. And who are you? Netti. Nobody will ever raise me I have been sucked down into the mud. A desperate orphan prays Thee to adopt him as your son, oh God. Pista! Are you all right? Oh, moulding form, hold me together and in my needs help me not to cry but endure the shame whenever This twit still feels like cranking out babbling poems. Cretin. Got the message? Not the enemy will beat you to a pulp but your own Marxist gods' braggarts! You cretin, you! What a moron. If you're a moron, you're a moron. He's a complete moron. Pista! It's me! The kid! Enjoin on them all to behave Enjoin on them all to behave toward me with a bit more kindness Enjoin on them all to behave toward me with a bit more kindness Examine carefully my case Examine carefully my case before I should sacrifice myself. Enjoin on them all to behave toward me with a bit more kindness Examine carefully my case before I should sacrifice myself. - Hi love! - Hi. - Did you sleep? - No. - Do you love me? - Yes. - Really? - Really. - Greetings, Dr.! - Hello. Honey, these Germans wish they were in a night-club. I've been wondering- Wait a sec. Waiter, please serve them another round. Thank you. Yes, Sir! Sorry love, but one of them distracted me, he was a bit tense, I couldn't call sooner. Anyway! Would you like to join us? I'd send you a driver. I can't go. Namely... Someone's here. Who? A skinny person. - Do you know him? - No. And he's sitting there, right? - What does he want? - I have no idea. It's past 10 PM! He should leave and come back tomorrow. - He doesn't want that. - But why? Why is it so urgent? Hello! Hey, honey, do you hear me? I said: why is it so urgent? He was a prisoner... along with Pista for almost a year. With Pista. Where? - What's on the menu, Jozsi? - Vegetable dish with sunny side up. Dear Jozsi... try and focus a little bit... I can serve you wiener schnitzel with french fries. - Veal? - Of course. You see, head waiter, this sounds a lot different! - Three portions! - Sure. No, I don't want that. Kari, please. - I don't like these things. - He's right, Pista. That's impossible, Kari. Out of the question. There's a war going on, Netti. Do you eat veal every day? Why are you so contentious? Listen to me, head waiter, only for me! Sure, Dr. Hello. What's up, Jozsi? Did you piss your pants? No Dr., I only thought that you're leaving in an hour. But they can easily find me tomorrow. Well, there can be no business without risks, am I right? So true. You see, that's an eternal golden rule! Cheers! Excuse me Dr. Can I get your meat ration ticket? Oh, absolutely, head waiter! Here. Here. Thank you very much. Thank you. Are you kidding me? Did you give him your two weeks' tickets? Exactly. Or rather... almost that much. I can't return the favour. I don't have any meat ration tickets. This is unacceptable, Netti. Head waiter! Head waiter! Where had been this guy together with Pista for a year? - In Vac. - What's his name? What is your name again? Gyula Pelle. Gyula Pelle. Where did he come from? Where did you come from? From Nosztra; I was transferred to Nosztra. From Nosztra; he was transferred to Nosztra. Politics? - Politics? - Common law offence. Common law offence. Why was he accused? Why were you accused? Rape. Rape. Honey. Give some money to our guest and send him away. Tell him I'll be there tomorrow. He can visit me whenever he wants to. - He can come at an early hour. - He can't visit you. A truck driver will pick him up, and he will visit his parents in the countryside. He can visit me any time he's in town, all right, but send him away! - Got it? - Yeah. - Will you do it? - Yes. For sure? For sure. I don't like these things, Kari. I hate nothing more than accepting something which I cannot return. I know that. You have a mean... You have an awfully mean side. Anyway, take a look at this! What do you think? What are these? Meat ration tickets. Cute little meat ration tickets! You see? If you're looking for the ace of spades you simply have to ask. Do you want it? What a sweet, sweet idiot you are. I don't know what I would do without you. You don't have to be afraid while I'm here, dear child. Anything unimaginable may come alive. - Do you still have your paper? - Sure. It looks good. It not only looks good, it is good indeed. It is usable for exactly one month. Then you must burn it. But I can find you another one. Hey, honey, Do you take care of that boy? I do my best. Just do it. You can never tell. It might be worthwhile. - Do you love me? - Yes. Sounds like a "pro forma" statement. Why would it be "pro forma"? I have no idea how I should say it. Do what I told you, please! Give him the money, and he can visit me any time. I've been waiting for you for eight long years. And you finally belong to me. I can't stand messengers! I hate messengers! Especially when they bring reports from the dead. I also hate violent rapists! I specifically hate their kind! Can you hear me? Yes. I've had enough, Kari. I hang up now. Bye. What are you speculating? Doesn't he practice law any more? No. He works at the Ministry of External Trade. And what is his job? He negotiates, principally, with foreign clients. Even now. - Are you a smoker? - Yes. I'll get you some cigarettes. The "living literature" doesn't "live" inside the author, it lives in his work. I'm sure that Oedipus Rex is much more striking than some already forgotten recent successful dramas. Not even two thousand years could efface Oedipus. We must not confuse living literature with present-day literature. Likewise, living art is not necessarily present-day art. They're not identical. Buy more eggs! I was lucky enough to find ten eggs today. Marvellous... I haven't eaten eggs in ages. How long did you talk? Not too long. Lasted about ten minutes perhaps. You should have heard the never-ending applause! It rumbled and went on for minutes! It seemed like it would never end. Great. Wonderful. What about the federal deputies? What was the look on their face? I didn't really notice anything. They didn't reply. They couldn't have replied. It was so obvious that they agreed with me, that contradiction was out of the question. How do you hold that wretched fork? A refined person doesn't hold the fork at the neck like that! What is it now? Tell me. You're nuts. Say, how can you recite that stuff at a youth gathering, in front of thousands? Why? Am I wrong? - Can truth be dual? - Of course not! But you can't talk about that in front of an assembly. Thousands! Why not? I don't get it. Only there! That's why we have an assembly. The only appropriate place! You're going to get what you deserve. You're a provocateur, a demagogue. You'll be lucky if you get off relatively lightly. I merely told the truth. I'd be silly if I said that these young people don't take into consideration the possibility that the others' truth is different than the leaders' truth. Doesn't it mean anything to you? Don't tell me you're not interested. I know you well. We're talking about socialism. How should we even begin? It cannot be true that he didn't leave a message. That's impossible. Think about it. He couldn't have done it. Why not? He didn't expect my early release. He was always waiting for a discussion, an apology for their mistake, and he hoped he might be allowed to leave. He couldn't even foretell how ill he was. He hadn't been able to move during those last two days. Why was he ill? Pista! Pista! Looks like you were beaten up pretty well. Oh my god. How can you treat a human being like that? "Hölderlin ist ihnen unbekannt?" asked Dr. H. G. K. while he was digging the hole for the horse's carcass. "Who was that?" asked the German guard. "The author of Hyperion." explained Mr. H. G. K., who loved explaining things. Just like me. Right, kid? Then right after that he raised a question: "How do you like... Heine for example?" "Who are those?" The guard looked at him with arched eyebrows. "Poets." German poets. said Dr. H. G. K. How about that? Now you're telling us stories about folks who bore grotesque names. I bet you he was a Jew. "You don't even know Schiller's name, do you?" "I do." said the German guard, aggressively. - "What about Rilke?" - "I've heard about him too." the guard replied, his face turned red, and shot Dr. H. G. K. That's how... son... Don't be a fool... a man can do anything to another man. It depends on who has the power, and who is merciless enough to do it. Five minutes before they took him to the hospital he had acted like a madman. What envelope? That's why I'm here. It contains his diary. and an almost finished study about Babeuf. He said that if I read it I will know him better. Then he gave me Dr. Agoston's address. He bequeathed him the envelope. I have the envelope. Didn't he say anything about me? Only about his diary and Babeuf? I don't believe it. It's true. He talked about you. Often? - All the time. - What exactly? - Lots of things. - Elaborate! - What? - What Pista said. - About your hair. - And? - Your eyes. - And? And your legs. And what did he say? He said that they're so beautiful. The way you walk... Things like that. It was because she had been an athlete, you know. Or possibly because she loved to dance. She recognized the rhythm of everything right away. The secret of the way she walked was that it seemed as if parts of her body would know about each other. They sent information to each other. A single step of hers was so calm... like when a bird soars, makes a circle and descends again. What the hell! Guards! Guards! Guards! What is wrong with you? Move! Hey! - Hannover... - Why are you yelling? - Do you want to stand by the wall? - He collapsed! Fainted. Go back to your place. Hey, what's the deal? We should call a doctor! Shut your bloody trap, all right? You're serving your prison sentence. You cannot open your mouth. Do you understand? You dirty, rotten fascist bastard! He will regain consciousness. One bucket of water... I can guarantee it. I was held in prison from February 1949 to May 1950. Proletariats of the world- Fascist bastard. Did you think Istvan Hannover, in 1944, that five years after the liberation you deserved this punishment in the "prison of socialism"? You believed in something. I wonder what it was. What if you were wrong when you were believed? Good afternoon! Identity cards please! Prepare your identity cards! Show your ID cards! I could tell immediately that the patrol posed a real threat when he entered the Savoy. I wondered if I could somehow avoid the danger. I left Pista and the others as if I had something urgent to do. Hey! Where are you going so hastily, Miss? - I have to go, they're waiting for me. - I must check your ID first. I forgot it at home unfortunately. What did you forget? My documents. She has to come with us to the guardroom then. I want you to stand by the wall! Get moving! Balogh! Stay with her. - No. 12! Come with me. - Yes Sir! Good afternoon! Show your ID cards! Hey! Show me your ID! I'm talking to you. Hey! Fucking hell! The girl ran away! There! Why were you staring so stupidly? I ran as fast as I could. I enjoyed the cold breeze. Just like the sprint. Ah, there they are! They're all after me. None of them remained at the Savoy. Cretins! I might get away from them. They're slower than molasses in January! Stop! They grabbed a car Follow the girl in the trench coat! Little did they know that I competed in track and field. I was a 400 metres runner. I'm almost as fast as their car. Holy mackerel! What a sprint! Even now when I think about it, I was in the mood for running. I felt like I scared everyone else, and that I'll be as famous as the marathon runners. More famous. I thought I was the one who saved the world. They might catch me, but they won't catch up with me. I no longer run on the ground but on a faraway highway in a faraway country. Bounded by the wind on each side, and paved with fish scales, so that running wouldn't be tiresome. Indeed, I wasn't tired at all. Freeze! Stop, you little bitch. You'll be sorry! Goddamn! Are you messing with us, bitch? You get what you deserve! Let's take her to the guardroom! I barely huffed when they pushed me in the car. I was light as a feather. So happy, so stoned. It seems like helping others is not without merit. I found my ID card in the guardroom straight away, of course. What the hell. You're father is a railroader and your mother is a laundress in the Parish of Kispest. Yes. Why did you ran away scared to death then, Miss? I thought I left it at home, and that it could cause a big problem. I was afraid... Who do you think we are? Why would you be afraid of the police, Miss? We only hunt down Jews and the Bolsheviks. You should have known better. You lovely, you! You have no idea what you've done. You were amazing! That meeting was quite something! That younger one shouldn't be taken seriously, he was only a liaison officer, but other one, the older, he was a very precise individual! If he had been arrested... well, that would have been terrible. With setting the police against yourself you saved him from the arrest. If that makes you happy I can run any time you want me to. I love you so much, you know. You sweetheart, you! - I can't tell you how much... - Sssh! Sometimes you're not allowed to say that. Sweetie, my dear! I asked myself many times: how come his knowledge is so vast? He could quote a great deal from literature. From Kafka, Joyce, Rimbaud. Dostoyevsky. Hungarian literature. More than that. '19, the Hungarian Soviet Republic. Economic problems. But most of all, he liked to talk about you. About me? Yes. He said that I can learn anything about anyone, but I can take the "Netti exam" only in front of him. Why did you have to take an exam about me? Pista said, that... that's why I'm self-conscious. Just like he had been before. He said he talked about those things so often because he wanted to think of the pleasant things in life, not his environment. Don't you worry, son. Don't think about being ugly all the time. Someday someone will make you forget that. Why are you standing still? Take away the patient! Someone will take you for a boat ride. That's the last thing I've heard from him. He referred to that trip. Did he tell you that too? Yes. What did he say? That's very important to me. You have to tell me. - But you know that. - Sure. But I'd like to know how he described it. - I can't recount it like he did. - It doesn't matter. Try! Tell me, please! I have the right to know. If anyone has the right to know it, that's me. He said that he didn't even bring a swimsuit. He wasn't able to because he didn't have one. And that he sat in the boat in knee breeches. He was afraid to look at you. So true. Breeches, flannel shirt... and a lumber jacket. He called me by my last name. He gazed at the landscape like he couldn't turn his head and look at me. The next day we bought a swimsuit together. He blushed. Yes, like that. He rode towards you, to Szentendre. Then you found a clearing on the isle. Exactly. That's right. We came upon it unexpectedly. A captivating grassy riverbank bordered by willows and a lean, wizened tree-trunk which, like a bridge, led to the shingly bank along the glade. The sun was dazzling on that glade. The trees all around surrounded shady spaces. The trees cast deep shadows. Pista said that silence was unlike anything else. The wild bees' buzz was the only sound that broke the breathless air. From afar, very, very, far the creaking of ungreased wagon wheels could be heard. The taste and smell of the pear remain sensible to this day - he said. Let's swim! I don't have a swimsuit. You don't need a swimsuit. We swim in the nude. What makes you think so? Someone might see us at any moment. Who? You see, no one has come for ten minutes. It's around noon. Those who want to go round the isle have already arrived by boat. They haven't rowed downstream yet. There's no sign of approaching ships. Not a single soul nearby. There was not a sound to be heard. Come! Are you... Are you serious? God! You think you're a hero, don't you? You don't dare to swim naked with a girl? When she threw her shirt on me... that moment was indescribable. It was self-confident. Kind flirtation and candid coquetry of the sense of beauty without prudery. Here's my swimsuit. You take care of it. How long I could have swam, I don't know but the water was ineffably splendid. Chilly, yet velvety. The chill embraced me like the wind embraces a naked statue. I was watching the dragonflies' flight above the water, and I was swimming against the tide smoothly, without difficulty, although I was far from the riverside in the deep. The current was strong. But I won easily. Everything was still. The air seemed to be motionless, only the water was flowing beneath. Pista was outside on the riverbank, alone, fully dressed, he was clutching his knees, watching the sky. The temperature is great! It's a pity you didn't come. There's the bush next to you! Why don't you hide away? Tungsram 8. is watching you across the river! Here's your swimsuit. Why should I hide behind the bush? I have absolutely no reason to hide behind the bush. First two! Step out of the boat! The boat is stranded. Why do we have a coxswain at all? What happened then? Did Pista tell you what happened after that? You had an argument, said Pista. He was very jealous... Very jealous? - Then you reconciled. - And? That was the first day of his healing process. Did he say anything else? - Not much. - I want to know. I can't talk about things like this! Please! You were his true love. I felt like I lost my breath while I was sitting there. I became fully relaxed. My bones were almost liquefied. Heat spread through my belly. I felt him inside. It was insane. Because I also loved him the most in the whole wide world. Netti! Come here! Come with me! - Where? - Don't ask, just come. I'll give you Pista's diary. And the study about Babeuf. This is Netti's bed. Let's take a good look at it now that we are here. This is Netti's bed. Rococo style, inlaid furniture. You ought to take a closer look. I selected it from the bankrupt Baroness Heilig's estate. I defended not only communists, but I also had a few quite well-to-do people. Here you are! I was always happy when I could drink a high quality beverage now and then. The bed was made by an unknown craftsman, a serf to a newborn baroness, to serve as a wedding bed. One's impression may be that he had finished the joinery in eight days and he... had been puttering with the marquetry and the fretwork for years. Take a gander at the proportions the blend of idleness and daintiness. It's like a dancing bear. - Really! - Very witty! Take a look at the heavy irregularity of this whole thing and the delightful excellence of the details, e. g. the fine design of the marquetry or the ethereal energy of this charmingly arching ornamentation. Today, exactly four weeks after she received her bed, she had this cheeky little idea, - guess what - that she found a small, matching Biedermeier-style marble-inlaid table. - A truly unique piece! - Kari! Bewitching! Don't you talk too much? Honey Can I talk too much about you at all? All of our friends know very well that I adore you. Everything is perfect, no matter what you do. You know that. Bravo, friend! Superb! You're an extraordinary husband, Kari. I've always wanted a man like you. The bed is also Kari's. I hate everything here! It's nice, though. Give me that letter, now! Are you leaving so soon? I'd like to. Don't be silly. What happened was according to Pista's will. I know. Kari was the only person in the world who Pista wasn't suspicious of. He trusted him till the end, and he loved him. Yes. I've heard that. Then... he sent a message. I got it six months after his death. Two months ago. He wrote me that if he dies, I should be Kari's wife. Because no one will treat me like Kari did. I got the message, and then, a week later I found myself as Mrs. Agoston. Give me that manuscript, now! Don't be so jealous, nitwit! Oh, world, blushes rosy red. Glad and sullen desire of relaxed figures. Mysterious, bright, beautiful city of a thousand soft nests. Oh, saintly chime of dawn! Symphony of life. Wonderful life. Life would be so great. Leave me be! Kiss me back! I can't do that! Will you stop it please? Why can't you? Because of Pista. You're lying. You are Pista! - I'm not him! - Yes, you are. It's undeniable. Your voice. The way you recite a poem. The way you eat. How you crack your knuckles. He didn't trust anyone besides Dr. Agoston. He would trust you as well. Kiss me back! Leave me be! I've never been with a woman before. You're lying again. No, I'm not lying. That's why you were convicted. No. You told me on the phone. - It wasn't like that. - How was it? Well, as a matter of fact it was bollocks. The guys laughed at me because I'd never been with a woman and they threw the bitch on me. First, she made a pass at me then she started insulting me. "You skinny creep!" - she yelled at me. "Scrawny worm!" "Smeary-face!" I hit her. I knocked her over to the ground. I was starting to rip off her clothes. When I saw her breast I felt as if the blood rushed to my head. Nevertheless, she managed to escape. The boys were laughing, hollering. I ran after her, tore off her clothes completely. She got away, naked, shouting for help. I chased her. That's why I got only a year and a half. Why haven't you been with a woman before? I'm afraid of them. Are you lying now? I'm not lying. Are you afraid of me? Yes. I'm afraid. Because you're ugly? Because I'm ugly. That is not true. Yes it is. I am ugly. Wait! Don't move for a little while. Don't turn back. I couldn't resist. I had to look at her. I wanted her so much that I couldn't look anywhere else. Look at me. - You are just like me. - No. - No! - Trust me. We are all like this. I remember Pista talking about the way she moved. Maybe because she was an athlete. Or possibly because she loved to dance. She recognized the rhythm of everything right away. According to Pista, the secret of the way she walked was that it seemed as if parts of her body would know about each other. They sent information to each other. A single step of hers was so calm like when a bird soars, makes a circle, and descends again. It is impossible that they ignore me. There is no way they won't apologize, express regret. Conspiracy against the state... So ridiculous! Ever since I can remember, I've done everything for the benefit of this government. Am I wrong, kid? Is it possible that I won't get compensation? But what If I get it? What would it mean? Don't go back! Go ahead, don't worry. Hi! Hi! Has the skinny one left yet? He's leaving right now. Now? Now. I thought you were sleeping. I wasn't sleeping. Did you come from your room? No, I didn't. Did you come back from the stairway? Yes. I came back from the stairway. That's a pretty nasty thing, Netti. We've only been together for two months! You didn't even have the opportunity to get to know me You haven't thought about that, have you? Do you have to be in a hurry? Yes. I think I have to, Kari. You don't have enough clothes! Everything has been packed up. In the afternoon we packed everything. That is enough. Could you wait, please? Maybe we could meet before we make a decision. I can't. I'm sorry. So sorry. But I can't. I'm pretty sure, Kari. It's a pity. Well... - bye, then! - Bye. I hang up now. Me too.
