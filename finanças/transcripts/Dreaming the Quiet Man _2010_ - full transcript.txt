Making firearms is a piece of pie. It's just a Java word. This is my business, my profession, the way that I support my family. I love the business. I like the people. I am not what is called a career director. I knew what great directors and great actors were like. But. I have to honestly say he was the best. Really The best. The meanest. Oh, he could kill you. He could hurt you. We could, you know. And when I come in on the set, he used to ask the makeup man, Jimmy Barker, who did my makeup all the years in Hollywood. And he'd say, How is she today? How is she today? And they'd say, Oh, she's in an awful good humor. She's wonderful. She's feeling great. And he'd say, Oh, God, help us, or we're going to have a horrible day. Or they say, Well, no, she doesn't feel too well. She's got a terrible headache. And he'd say, Oh, great, great. That's great news. We're going to have a great day. The first name that I saw associated with films that I really reacted to in a strong way wanted to be with or they were on television or movies, meaning I wanted to see again and again and and Joy was the name for it. That was it. I think what it is is more to do with the relationship with the people, the. That is the the the warmth and the the warmth that I can feel from behind the camera for the characters and for the actors is no doubt. My father looked up to John Ford like they called him Pappy Pappy for like he was his father and he respected him so much. And my dad knew that he was talented. And my my dad knew that John Ford loved him in his own way. I was on every set of the movies that he made from 1956 on. And I, John Ford, I remember him a lot. And, you know, I tried to stay away from him because he scared me as a kid. He had the eyepatch on by that time. And the the cigar, which Maureen said it was all on purpose. Everything Ford did was for a reason. He had the cigar stub with the with the tobacco running down his face. And that was just a scary thing for a kid. He was an immigrant who was completely at home showing the American dream and the American values of the frontier. And he was a tough bastard, you know. I mean, he wasn't a fairly across U.S., as people say. He drank quite a bit, but I think he could hold it. And he was like, you know, I always saw him with that one with the eyepatch, like a kind of, you know, Cyclops, you know, and their recyclables. And I think he would have and he was the best filmmaker from that generation. The American West as we know it from the cinema, was almost entirely the creation of John Ford. Tourists come to Monument Valley to see where he made John Wayne a star in Stagecoach. Where the cavalry rode out and she wore a yellow ribbon with the homestead burned in the searchers. He made nine films here. Part of the landscape is named in his honor. Ford's point, he loved it here, not just because it looked like no other place on Earth, but also because it was far from everything. He'd rather not deal with Hollywood studio executives, wife and children. And it was here he allowed himself to dream of a film he'd one day like to make for himself a very personal film. Not that he'd ever admit it. Don't you remember The Shining and how it was? The road lit up past the chapel and his world. And his world. And there was the field where Dan Tobin is coaching. John Williams first came here making the movie and they came in the road and the Janson car and they were just an amazing film. This is the most famous bridge, and this is a picture of John Wayne who has just arrived here less than a week ago. But you can see him here sitting there at this bridge and all this former glory he has. And they're so famous and amount of busses, cars every day here is unreal. And it's just great to see it being turned off like this now. And John Wayne is here behind us, which is nice. Vanya and hat and coat and. Yes. This is Sean Thornton, born right here in this free home from America. It's just that ever since I was a kid living in a shack near the slag heaps. My mother's told me about Innisfree and why the Morne Innisfree has become another word for heaven to me. His school is only on his mother's side. And John. So they cut it all. Bareilles wrote. But the question of the girls fortune. We were fortune. Why everybody should be worried. With that, I still say no. Oh, come on, McLean. I told you that you are no good. I'll explain it to her myself. I'll count three. And if you're not out of the house by then, I understand I was on you. If you say three, Mr.. You'll never hear the man. Count ten. Just tearful. Just within the scene of the fair, De was held. He's sold across beds. He's up the hill there about 200 yards. And Sean and Mary Kate are sitting in their little tub Cartier and said. Go on, go on. Ask them for more money. Is that all you've done? Or is ever think about money? Money. Right at the seafront there, the coffee shop that Emily O'Connor opened front and an ad for water on the window. Lyons Tea. That's the level of detail, folks you got to get down to for your load in this body. That's what this. Documentary found out, huh? What's this for? It's about the car. Yeah, which is our first problem. There is. Twin. Generations after John Ford brought his cast and crew to come, the village has become a place of pilgrimage, a playground for fantasies of a movie made long before most of the visitors were born. Kong was the location for the mythical Innisfree, the place to which the returning Sean Thornton comes trying to escape the shadow cast over his life by tragic events in America. Until Ford or Roy of the town had no electricity and one telephone line. It was a story by Maurice Walsh that brought John Ford here. A love story set during the Irish War of Independence. It was originally published in the Saturday Evening Post and then in a book called Green Rushes. But it's better known under its original title, The Quiet Man. He knew that Ireland was a metaphor for a form of life that he thought was rapidly disappearing and tragically disappearing from the modern world. And he knew that if he went to Ireland, he could find those forms of life still alive and that they could be remolded into an imaginative form that would awaken echoes in a lot of bosoms. And so it was the the imaginary island of the of the quiet man that that he knew would withstand the the the the test of time. Of course, every storybook Irish village must have a cozy little pub, and Ford put Collins Bar right in the middle of Innisfree. It's still here, but it wasn't really called Co-heads and it wasn't really a bar. It was Murphy's Hardware store, and the Murphys are still here to. So. Yes. Just as a crew just doing a documentary about Detroit, it reminds us of people wide pipes. It's just a wonderful movie. Yeah. Boy, this appealed to your heart. Why do you like it? Well, yeah. Yeah. And good luck. Right. And I was a John Wayne fan from long ago. Yes. So that's part of it. It's got everything right. Okay. Well, you want to see the pictures? What I really want is my brother here. Okay, From here. That's similar from the. The name of the shop is John Murphy for change, the name to call ahead. So I have to know better known now as Pat Callahan than it is John Murphy. But I think the whole idea of put that up there, I think it was a joke for the Jews in America, as he says of the film. Over here, we predominantly. Kohan and the Jews call themselves Colons of America. So I think that was a joke I thought was the reason. I think over here we pronounce it Kohan. He he knew exactly what he wanted and he wanted you have to get that. So he was a difficult man to work with, but he'd make sure he wouldn't take any shortcuts. But he'd done what was well done. In this hotel in New York City, the Algonquin. Jack Hemingway, the son of Ernest Hemingway, overheard two gentlemen arguing vehemently, and one of them saying, The greatest writer of them all is Ernest Hemingway. And Jack went over to the two gentlemen and said. I'm sure you gentlemen will be interested to know. The greatest storyteller of them. All, my father used to say. Was an Irish writer named Maurice Walsh. Oh, my Christ, said one of the men on Maurice Walsh. And this, of course, was the Maurice Walsh who wrote The Quiet Man. There was a sense that he, Ford, was creating a whole. World. Out of his head. Out of his heart, out of Maurice Walsh's. Novel. And. Melding it into something that he wished to be true. When the film was completed in 1952, John Ford made sure that it had its world premiere in Ireland, where his parents had been born. Ford considered himself a journeyman director. He rarely even chose the subjects of his own films. But there was something about the Quiet Man that made him spend almost 20 years trying to get it made. In his long career, he made over 100 movies. But this is the one that people took to their hearts. And we're still watching it. We are. I went to New York for the opening of the film and the people were were going mad. Absolutely mad. They they it was it was the love of their life from the very first time they saw it. I'd like to tell you about the Quiet man. He's John Wayne. In a picture you'll soon be sharing. It's the story of Sean Connery, a right hand man who came from America to forget his past and injury. There he met a fiery red headed Lars and the village marriage broker went to work. The picture has an extraordinary feeling right from the beginning. A warmth and intimacy. Personal commitment. That's rare in pictures. I just feel that for its heart is in this picture more than in any other picture of the native. He never made a film remotely like it. Nobody ever did. That's a pretty bonnet you have on it. But you'll be talking to me about Barnett after leaving mine stuck up there. Like it? Easy. You have the good manners not to hit the man on Tuesdays. Your husband and your bag man or bully of a brother. Read. Will Donna hurt? Refuse to pay her rightful dowry? It is poetry. It is poetry. I was Jack Nicholson, I said when we were doing The Departed, he said. God gave the Irish the words, the Italians, the music. I said, okay, so that's Jack's idea. But I said, But listening to the words said, Yeah, you know, we just listened to and it sounds like music. I say, And that film is filled with it. The Quiet Man, It just is filled with it. But it's very important that that particularly I don't know what's out of Ireland or whatever, but particularly one understands the nature of tribal life. I understand the clan in order to understand the behavior of the characters in that picture. There will be no locks or bolts between us. Mary Kate, Except those in your own mercenary little heart. Mary Kate left him to go to Dublin, but he caught her at the station and brought her back with the whole town, watching him do it. I'll pay you. Never. The quiet man as it came out is a permanent way, really, in John Ford's career of saying about all the other films. And I mean, here, The Grapes of Wrath and I mean here How Green Was My Valley, All the so-called great films, the ones that are shown in film societies. I'm not that John Ford. I remember where I came from and I remember the values of where I came from. And I've made a film to show you what those values are. It will survive me. And it has. His direction makes unforgettable the performances of John Wayne, Maureen O'Hara, Barry Fitzgerald, and Victor McGlothlin. Ford made a silent film called The Secret Man, and he was sort of a secret man. He was he was a quiet man in the sense that he didn't tell you what he was thinking. And he was. I interviewed Ford once, and he was the most difficult person to interview. It was a fast talking to him because he wouldn't give you a straight answer to anything. And one of his friends said that was his Irish trick to survive in Hollywood, that if you run around in Hollywood talking about your art, people would have killed you back then. You know, he said, I poses in illiterate. He said, Don't let this get around. We published a book I did about John Ford called John Ford. I had originally watched him shooting Giant Otter in Monument Valley. That's how we met. We talked about the Quiet Man, but not an enormous amount. I couldn't get him to talk a lot about anything. And I did a documentary about him after that. He was not very cooperative, but we did it anyway. Isn't the sunshine's bright kind of a little picture that you made for yourself with that? Yeah. Uh huh. Can I ask you what what particular element about the Western appeal to you from the beginning? Would you agree that the point of, uh. Fort Apache. Was that the tradition, the tradition of the Army was more important than one individual. Could. I knew he was Irish. How could you not? If he'd seen the Quiet Man. He'd have a party every Saturday for the cast. They'd sing. I went there. It was it was a it was a family feeling. He was the patriarch. And he'd say things like. Doby Carey. Yes, sir. Doby. Harry Carey. Jazz. Stand up. Sing the national anthem. I didn't know what that meant. So he sings the wearing of the green. Oh, Patti, dear. And did you hear the news that's going around? The shamrock is forbidden to grow in Irish ground. And he sings the whole song and forges, leans back, closes his eyes, listens to the whole thing. That was the end of the party one Saturday. When I used to go to dinner to their house. John Ford made me sing for my dinner and we'd sit at the dining room table and I'd have to stand up and he'd say what song he wanted, what song he wanted, and I had to sing. And one time Mary Ford said, Maureen's coming to dinner. My God, we're going to get Ireland all night. And it was true. All he did was ever talk about Ireland and his Irish relatives. You think he. He created Ireland and farmed it in the sea. Fought it. Always plan to make the film in Connemara in the west of Ireland, from where his own people had come. John Ford was born. Sean Feeney. And Feeney was still a prominent name in the Irish speaking village of Spittal. The region had been devastated by the famine in the 1840s. A century earlier, death or emigration saw the population of Ireland shrink from 8 million to 3 and a half. John Ford's parents were among those driven from the land. While making the film, Ford frequently visited his Feeney cousins in the old family home, the little cottage that had inspired him to create a way to mourn for Sean Thornton. It was a lovely little house shining. And the. Roses. And her. Your father used to tease me about them. But he was that proud of them, too. And that's nothing but a humble cottage. Barrie Fitzgerald. That's just a wee humble cottage, but it's actually a lot more. It represents the Irishness of John Ford has tremendous meaning. It's clearly a memory image. And you're in the head of John Wayne and it's an expressionistic way of. We're now entering into his consciousness. It's like his fantasy world. Because I am Sean Thornton and I was born in that little cottage over there, and I come home and the home I'm going to stay. Will. John Ford. And my father. Were first cousins. I have great memories of John Ford when he came to. Ireland to film The Quiet Man. He always had the prayer book on the mouth organ. I mean, he was always a kind of wild man, but he was a religious man. Prayer book was. Always he had it always with him and, you know. The mouth organ. This is the film as a very rare photograph of John Ford's father, John Elliott wishes Feeney. He went to America and settled down in Portland, Maine. He had to leave. There was no work at the time and there was a big family, so they had to. They all left except my grandfather, Newt Feeney. There is one here. John Ford. My sister breeds pet food. Norah Connolly and my other sister Mary. I remember you were the youngest at the time. He was only small and I remember him one day on Sunday and he sat in Maureen O'Hara's lap. She was she was a lovely person, you know, She very nice, very good memories of visiting the house every swim Sunday afternoon, John Paul would drive with his entourage. You know, all the he'd be at the head of the posse, you know. Then when they got here, I had to figure it out myself. Could you imagine? Watching for any. Yeah, Jorginho can get our finish, Francis said. I just wish it was. I didn't finish. I guess we should get out. Yeah, but Ed had a collar. Yeah. Of course. A chef's a shumba. And then you have a bishop for kitchen towel up on bar on the side of a hill. EDIT Armed with that, I guess we should have gone. They'd gone in contact. Mike. In Mike. In every area, to be sure. Agip championship. The Hawks and Tyler that they'd been dead for the ED. Really. So they've got the same edge. Every Sunday, he'd bring them to the. House on Sundays, like, you know. And of course, that the cartridge at the time it was there wasn't a lot of room there and there was a bed there. And he said, That's the bed. No, he said that my father was born. And of course, it wasn't. This is the painting of the old house. This is the way the house was when you turned for his father. Left it. See that big stone there which forms part of the wall of the house. It's a massive size. It goes all the way in. For just tonight and bragging to John Wayne and Victor Mclaglen every. Sunday when they used to visit areas. I point out that we've stolen. Just the. Various from my cousins that's stolen their. Single handedly pushing new. New world at the Yang, said believably, you know. And this is where the old kitchen was? No. And the fireplace was there. There was a door into the bedroom there. And there was a back door to door backdoor. And the other bedroom was over there on that side. So this is where John Ford's father, he walked out this door on his way to America, to Portland, Maine. I do not believe I heard your name. Tall man. Thornton. John Thornton. And your father's name Like Michael Thornton. You used to live here. Quite a morning. Just bought the place back. That's why I'm here. Then your grandfather would be all charm. All right. Bless his memory. So Jim Shelves were named after. Well, now that being the case, it is a pleasant evening and we will have a great time. There was. While Colonial boy Doug was his. The dream of the Quiet Man began a long way from Ireland. Ford's parents, John Feeney and Abby Curran, had left Connemara for America when they were 15 years old. Although born only a few miles from each other, they didn't meet until they got to Portland, Maine, where they married and raised a family. Abby looked after the children, and John set about making his way in America. At first, things in Portland were hardly any better than the life they had left behind. The settled Protestant Yankees bitterly resented the incoming Catholic Irish. John Feeney had a family to feed. He needed a job. But signs saying no Irish need apply seem to hang on every door. Prejudice was rife. The Ku Klux Klan was active in Portland, targeting the Jewish, black and Irish newcomers. But these groups banded together and stood up to the violence and intimidation. The old World was very, very, very strong in my life. And and there was a certain way of doing things and behaving with each other. And so the people who felt that way automatically responded to particularly the quiet men because of that. And don't forget, the Irish were the in America. They broke the ground for all the other immigrant groups, really taking all the abuse and the extraordinary prejudice against the Irish and laid laid the groundwork for the others to come in. Whatever group it is will always have problems. But the worst that occurred. Up to now, I think had been with the Irish. But John Ford's mother lost five children when they were young, five or 11, which was a similar statistic. What would happen tomorrow so that respect her life wasn't. Hugely different, but at least there was hope. There was a possibility through honest work or through dishonest work, to get ahead, to get education for your children, to get better medicine, to marry your children. And the woman was always the center of the family in Connemara. And I think that transferred across the ocean where in Ford's household, the mother was all powerful. She made all the decisions. Eventually, his father found work selling bootleg liquor to the Longshoreman and Portland docks. He worked his way up to being a saloon keeper and moved his family to the more affluent area of Peaks Island. He was becoming a successful American businessman. But if his children were American, their mother never stopped reminding them that they were also Irish. The Feeney children were raised in an Irish speaking household. Ireland, its history, its stories was his real to them as America. Abby's favorite was her youngest son, a short sighted kid who was smart, although bored by school. But he loved the movies. John Ford did well in high school, but when he went to college, he was treated at the University of Maine with contempt by some of the WASPy boys there who called him Shandygaff Irish. Actually, he was a waiter in the first week he was there. He was he was serving stew on a tray. And one of the guys said, Hey, Shanti, bring me the stew. And Ford threw the whole tray at these guys and quit college. And that was it for him. So he was a rebel. We're here in Portland, Maine, at Gorham's Corner, which was a heavily Irish neighborhood. I can guarantee that Ford, as a boy, would have been on the spot at one point or another. Some of the characters that you see in his movies are characters modeled on his own parents, ones who who portrayed a life that was not an easy life for him. Big family, a father who wasn't always the greatest provider in a tough time here in the city of Portland, where work was solely physical. Nothing else. You can't watch all those movies and not walk around and wonder what he would have thought and what he did and who he met and what trouble he might have gotten into. All around the streets right here. His older brother Francis had gone to Hollywood, where he was working as an actor and director in silent movies. Francis found that Irish names didn't open many doors, so the legend has it. Inspired by a passing motorcar, he changed his surname to Ford, and when his little brother Sean joined him on the West Coast, he did likewise. He worked as a stunt man, bit part actor, and finally began to make his mark as a writer and director. Life was good, but Ireland was on his mind. In 1921, the country was at the height of its war for independence from England. So John Ford decided he was going to help. He crossed the Atlantic and turned up on the doorstep of his cousins, the Thorntons. John Ford when he went back to Ireland in 1921 as a successful Hollywood director, he had $4,000 expense money from Fox. He was supposed to be scouting locations, but I think he gave the money to the Iraqis. What happened then? He wrote it off in his taxes, which I thought was kind of clever. When he arrived, the Thornton home was burning good black and tan to just burn the home. And the old couple were out on the on the road. And it was like a scene that he filmed later and films like The Searchers where the Home Burns. And then he went up in the hills and found the IRA guys and gave them some money and supported him. Very soon the British figured out that Ford was there and they beat him up and told him to leave the country. So he was only there for about maybe three days. But the Thornton family meant a lot to him, and they were living adjacent to the Phenix and Spittal. And so that's why John Wayne and The Quiet Man and Sean Thornton. Ford returned to Hollywood, still angry at what he had seen, but also still caught up in the idea of the whole thing as a great adventure. Many of his films were on Irish subjects, and The Informer won him his first Oscar in 1935. Then he found Maurice Walsh's story, and it seemed to offer the perfect vehicle to express the feelings of a proud Irish-American like himself. But before he could make his film set during the Irish War of Independence, another war intervened. There's something in the air. Something behind that sunset. When America entered World War Two, Ford volunteered his services to the United States Navy. Captain John Ford relished the role of Frontline cameraman, both as a patriotic contribution to the war effort and as the fulfillment of a personal, heroic fantasy. This really happened. He had tried to join the Navy during the First World War, but his poor eyesight had ruled him out. He wasn't going to miss this one. He got his wish, but the reality was something else. Ford was wounded, but he made it home. Many others didn't. Junior Stout, son of Archie Stout, one of the cinematographers and the Quiet Man was among those who died under Ford's command. By the time he finally got to make the quiet man. He was older, and the young man's daydream of heroic deeds now rang hollow. Well, I Ford was extremely affected by the war. I mean, he was in it for four or five years. He was there through the whole thing and he was deeply involved in it for fun. He wouldn't talk much about it. He'd seen the war close up. So when he came to make The Quiet Man a few years later, the war experiences deepened his sense of the tragedy underlying the story. Ford, since coming back from World War Two in 1945, had made 15 feature films, and almost all of them had something to do with war. So he broke from the patterns to some extent with The Quiet Man, because it's about a man seeking peace. And he took most of the politics out of the story. He had tried for years to keep the IRA background in it. So he progressively went away from that commanding force. You can forget about the commandant. Sort of peace now, man. Q But I haven't given up hope. You've got to realize that he shot this all over Hollywood first, and none of the major studios wanted the quiet man, they said. I forget who it was, but it was one of the studio guys who was an old friend of hoards and knew what he was. He said, You're in Ireland and we're in America, and I'm not going to pay for that. Everybody thought I was just a silly little Irish story. It means nothing, you know. And it was John Wayne worked for a studio called Republic Studios, and the head of the studio was a man called Herb Yates. And Duke said, Well, Pappy, he said, Let me take it to Herb Yates and try and see. And Ford thought, well, it's a waste of time. We're never going to get the money. And he let Duke take it to her. Yates and Herb Yates read it and said the same thing. It's a silly little Irish story. It'll never mean anything. And doomed started sweet talking them and everything. And finally Herbie. And he said, Well, he said, All right. Maureen O'Hara, John Wayne, John Ford. They they fought together for this. People think that they come to you with the script and everything's ready, and then you just say yes or no. But I believe Maureen O'Hara and my my dad. I had to do some finagling to get the financing for it, and that it was a real struggle and took many years and they finally really started with a dream. In 1949, John Ford returned to Monument Valley to make another Western. Herbert Gates reckoned that Ford's dream project was a folly and would end up losing his studio millions. So he made a deal. If Ford made Rio Grande cheaply and in black and white, then Republic Pictures would foot the bill for him to go to Ireland to make the quiet man. Herbert Yates didn't want to make it in Technicolor. Ford said, I will only make it in Technicolor. It was much more expensive to do, but he wanted the idyllic Ireland that only Winnie Hoek, who was a great, great cinematographer and the first great color cinematographer, could produce the misty ness of a remembered Ireland. Yates In Poetic Ireland. The head of Republic, Herbert Yates, was a notorious vulgarian. Ford told me he considered him a stupid man, is what he called him, and he would send telegrams like the film is to green, you know, stop showing everything looking green. Look, this is the northern end of the card that's cast on Kirk out there. And it was filmed by Ford quite deliberately in the background. But Ford put his own stamp on them, you know, to pick that. That is absolutely beautiful. But the nature of the photography of the film, which I think was greatly praised in its time, I think, at one Academy Award. And he, of course, won for best director. Which is the way the train comes into the station. The shade of forest green of the train, I believe. But you do feel a real sense of warmth and a love of character and the actors. That's the key thing. And the actors and place. Sense of place. Castletown Could you tell me the way the image phrase free. Oh, five miles and maybe a half more. Do you see that road over there? Yeah. Well, I don't take that one. It'll do, you know. Good. All the best. I will arise and go now and go to Innisfree. He would know that it was for Yeats, a magical landscape associated with a kind of deep peacefulness and almost Irish cultural magic. He knew he was writing a poem to Ireland in The Quiet Man. And one way of saying that you're writing a poem to Ireland is to to set the story in industry. I'll tell you. I'll tell you how that turned out cinematically. When in the opening sequence, Sean Thornton gets off the train. Everybody in the train crew starts arguing about the best way to industry. Then McLean often comes and picks up his baggage and he walks off. He says This way to Innisfree. They go through the deserted station house and they disappear into the dark. And as they're in the middle of the station house, what you see through a window is McLean, O'Flynn, sitting in his is his horse and buggy. And you realize that this is a path from reality to to timelessness. It's announced in cinematic terms, but you're you're about to enter an imaginary world that's been imagined out of actual societies and people and so on and so forth. But it's going to take on a mythic poet shape in history. This one is going to be, from my perspective. The moment that you see that window in the train station. That's the moment that you enter. Innisfree Innisfree belongs to the world of the horses and buggy, and the train belongs to the new world of steam power. And you see one crossing under you. Time these exactly so that you've got in about a ten second take. Everything that's going to happen in the film if you have eyes to see it with. I wonder now why a man would go to Innisfree. I sang Innisfree, but a famous musician heard the melody. There were no words, heard the melody, and played it for John Ford, who fell in love with the melody. And they sent for me and they played the melody for me. And I fell in love with the melody. And then John Ford said, We have to have words. And John Ford, Charley Fitzsimmons and me, we sat and John Ford would make a suggestion for the words and we'd agree with them or add a little bit, or you wouldn't dare claim that you were doing anything. John Ford was the boss, believe me, and I wrote them down. And those are the words that are sung to the Isle of Innisfree. They were written by John Ford and Charlie Fitzsimmons and here and there from me. Do you remember? Any words? Oh, Innisfree my island. I'm returning from wasted years across the wintry sea. And when I come back to my own dear Ireland and rest a while beside you grow a mockery. Those are the words or something in the picture now. And I didn't. Oh, God, I didn't even have to think. Isn't that terrible? No, it's not terrible. It's wonderful. Good. Yeah. There was much at stake as Ford arrived in the west of Ireland with his cast and crew shooting in Technicolor. On location was an expensive, complicated process. His production partner, Lord Callanan, suggested Ashford Castle as a suitable base of operations. It's just about every location the story would need could be found here or in the nearby village of Khan. Ensconced in his castle. The director decided that anybody he met and liked most, in fact, of fiction be his cousin. He was related to everybody. It was a big family, but he was the head of it. And his word was law in initial free. Well, I don't know of any other films that were ever made that involved so much of a family. They were all in love with the one thing Ireland. You know, it was a love affair. Well, I'm Charlie Fitzsimmons. I'm the son of Charles Fitzsimmons, who played Hugh Forbes in The Quiet Man. And Charlie Fitzsimmons is the brother of Maureen O'Hara. Uh, my father at the time, we had joined the Abbey Theater in Dublin. John Ford hired the Abbey Theater players to be in the movie. John Ford being Irish of Irish heritage. And then we have John Wayne was also has Irish heritage and of course Maureen definitely does. And then we have her brother Jim played Father Paul and Charlie Fitzsimmons played Forbes. So we have Maureen and her two brothers. I think John Ford actually had the most he had Francis. There was a Patrick Ford, too, in the cast list. So he did well with his family. And Reverend Playfair, who, of course, was Arthur Shields and his brother, Barry Fitzgerald. We all know him. In the Quiet Man, I think my brother Michael and Patrick, actually, I think all four of the kids were in there, Michael, Patrick, Tony and Melinda. And those are my dad's first four kids. And I wasn't born yet. I came next. We stayed with them for six weeks. They are the extras, you know. It was good for everyone around. And they traveled out with a convoy of vans every morning out tomorrow, places they were shooting. And the average pay for a worker at that time was £3 a week. We were getting triple that. We were getting £9 a week, which is three times the national average. And it stayed that way for six weeks and then disappeared. It was like a home movie. It was like a home movie in front of the camera and behind the camera. And and I think the whole world felt that. They couldn't articulate it, but we all felt I was very young when I saw them. They may have been 12 or something or ten. I think we loved it, you know, And over the years everyone laughed. It didn't matter, Italian or Irish. It just people reacted to it and enjoyed it because again, they identify with the people in the world and the ritual. I think the film is very personal to Ford because I think on some level Ford wanted to go back. To Ireland. You didn't grow up there. The idea of an American who comes to reclaim his land, reclaim his heritage and finds. Strife. And money problems. Obstacles and also falls in love the first time he sees Maureen O'Hara as so poetic. Well, that's important at the first moment of seeing her, because the journey they're going to take and I'm falling in love with each other. The issue is how would you register the impression on Sean that he sees? Well, when Ford does it, he does it from Sean's point of view. You don't see your type. You don't see your clothes. And after a while. But you see this figure, this this, this beautiful goddess like figure in the pastoral setting, you know? And this is his impression. It's not simply a figure of the woman. It's everything around her and where she fits in that world. There wasn't any greater acting because you didn't see us acting or doing anything. You just saw us walking through me, walking through the fields with the sheep. But I wasn't supposed to be a look of any extraordinary interest at that time because I didn't know who it was. It wouldn't be a curiosity. Look, then, who in God's name is that child? Even a girl today, if she turns around and looks on. It's a handsome looking man she's looking at. She'll give a special look. It's very personal to and also for other reasons. I mean, the love of his life. There were two loves in his life. Two big lovers in his life. His wife, his first. His only wife, Mary McBride Smith. And Katharine Hepburn. We called Cade. So the fact that her name and Maureen O'Hara's name in the picture is Mary Kane is no, no coincidence. They wished all the women in the world would be a mary Kate. But it wasn't because his great friends were. Katharine Hepburn was a great, great friend of his, and he always had her picture up on the wall. Mary. Forget it, Sean. Forget it. Ford definitely was enamored of Maureen O'Hara. There were stories about him on the location for The Quiet Man, crying about her and things like that. She writes in her book that he was. Really over the top in his pursuit of her. And she quotes letters that he wrote that are somewhat disturbing. And so he obviously had a kind of a crazed wish fulfillment passion, where he identified with the John Wayne character too much. He had a definite fantasy attraction to Maureen O'Hara. I wouldn't call them amorous letters. They were. Strange letters about how he was feeling and yet sometimes think. When. When did he write that? What did he write that for? And you'd think that he's up to different. He's up to something and you'd try to out guess him. But you couldn't. He was the devil himself, believe me. I suppose in the character of Mary Kate Tanner, the red haired, fiery woman, the strong woman with full control over the household and given out. The lads put their feet up on the chair and so on, so forth. That's the ideal model inside the house. She's in charge. She's in control. She'll even fire her own brother. You know, that sort of strong woman was kind of Ford's ideal of a woman. And they appeared in a lot of his movies, but none so obvious, I don't think, as Mary Kate Danaher. So he bought quite a morning in spite of you. Good for a widow to land. Oh, pay no attention to what? A task for a diabetic. Not always going to take no notice. If you do want there to be a fine week in this house tonight. After all, he's got more right to that land. And you have this is a woman who cannot be intimidated by by individuals, male or female. I mean, she is incredibly powerful. The reason she's unmarried, although she's beautiful, is that men are scared of her. They're terrified of her. Who would want to take on somebody like that? Only it would take a Sean Thornton and a Sean Thornton who is willing to fight the brother. She's this tempest of emotion and in power. She's like Shakespeare's. She's like Shakespeare's Kate in Taming of the Shrew. You know, she's just this force of nature. And the power of the woman in the picture is very strong. The nature of her, the nature of her resistance. And part of that being ritualistic. And of course, resulting in one of the great moments of all cinema when the storm breaks there. And basically it goes in the house and there's that extraordinary. One of the probably that and a couple of other. But one maybe in Hitchcock film the best kiss in motion pictures. Is is that is that scene in The Quiet Man. Oh my. Well, win, love, murder, heroin, and vice versa. Wayne was quoted as saying she was the greatest guy he knew, and she loved that. They had a very good relationship. It was everybody sort of agrees it was never romantic, but they were one of the great romantic teams. They seemed to have a good chemistry on the screen. Maureen O'Hara, opposite John Wayne. There weren't a lot of female personalities that had that kind of strength where my dad could really just be himself, and he knew that she was strong enough to hold up. And it was lovely on camera. So bold. When you are home again. You need to be kissing me so you can talk. I can. I will. And I do. And it's more than talk you would be getting if you step a step. Closer to me over. You get a lot of. You get over it. I'm thinking. Well, some things a man doesn't get over so easily. Maureen O'Hara hit him so hard that she cracked a wrist in that scene. What you see, they had to take her to the hospital. They had to take her to the hospital. That roundhouse. Right. She threw at him. He catches it in his hand rather than on his jaw. When John Wayne wouldn't have been with us for the rest of the film, I don't think. Duke came to me and grabbed my hand and he said, Let me see your hand. He said, You nearly broke my jaw and I bet you hurt your wrist. And he pulled my hand up and looked and all the pain was terrible. And they hit and he said, Get the car, get the car. And they did. And they took me over to the hospital in the valley and X-rayed my wrist. And I had damaged and I was put in a cast and I had to work with my hand in my skirt for a couple of days. But that's true. Tough Irish woman, you know, like John Ford. I mean, they were both I think they were both the same type of personalities. They really were. Because she was one you didn't want to mess with either, you know? I think Wayne was a kind of idealization of himself in certain ways. Wayne was good looking, tall, masculine. Ford was not particularly good looking. Not that tall. He wasn't sure, but he wasn't any John Wayne. On Stagecoach. Ford showed him the dailies and he came back. He said, How'd you like it? He said, Well, he said, It's great. Everything's great. Photography is great. What did you think of yourself? Well, I'm just playing you. You know what that is? And I said to him, What did you mean? That he was playing you as well? He said, I think if you're Ford, Harvey, you know for good. I have an idea. And. In his mind, he was like me. John Ford taught him how to walk. You see, he was all like me. Shoot. So, John four talk. He was going around the corner all the time, you know? I mean, he can't walk because he's unusual. We're walking. He's that size six. A woman would take bigger feet. You watch Dow and the film you see and you see his also smoking. I'm always you know, this is a walk. You know. You just kind of you jog to a walking side. You turn to a corner all the time. You watch him the next time you see the soup. Ford was the most difficult man in Hollywood on the set. He was like a great conductor conducting a great orchestra. But the way he did that was by being a mean son of a bitch. There was a thing with John Ford where. It was like when somebody walks into your home and you know that it's the great, great grandparent. When we were around John Ford, there was just a level of respect there that was unspoken. And Pappy was here. And so and on the set, I would try to hide behind anybody that I could because I didn't want to be in the line of sight with John Ford, because, of course, I saw him directing my father and the other actors. And it was quite scary. The impression I get just from the films is that he didn't give a damn really, at that point what people thought, I mean, in a sense about judgment. On what he believed about the relationship between men and women, about mothers and fathers, fathers and sons, fathers and daughters. He believed a certain way and he shot at a certain way. But the question of the girl's fortune was fortune by everybody. She didn't lead with that. I still say no. Oh, come on, MacLaine. I told you that you are no good. I'll explain it to her myself. I'll count three. And if you're not out of the house by then, I understand. I was on you. Read Will. Danaher has begun to give his loyalty to money and to the kind of power that money exercises. I'm a man of industry. And the best man And the best man means a man who owns the best land. He's a jumped up farmer. He's a jumped up farmer. He's a gambling man. Well, Mary Kate. Hey, we tried. We'll see them again some other time. I thank you anyway, Sean Thornton for the asking. You don't think this changes anything? It's what you say that counts, not him. Know, Sean. You've gone too far. That's enough. So what is this? We're going to get married. Are we? I don't get it. This is Ireland show. Without her brother's consent. She couldn't and wouldn't. I'm sorry if. He was in a state of mind where he was between cultures at that point. That sense of being between societies and outside all known systems of norms. He's neither American or Irish is precisely what provokes the rest of the conspirators to rearrange reality so that so that read Will Danaher will allow his just to record it. You've got to remember that the father learning and the play fairs and all of them and McLean all get into this conspiracy to rearrange reality so that he can so he can court her. Michaeleen OGU is the local matchmaker, bookmaker and wheeler dealer and man and so GC terms with the rules of reality. He knows exactly where and when they can be bent, renegotiated or outright broken. Ford knew there was only one actor who could do this part justice. His name was Barry Fitzgerald. Tata Willow can go ahead and a large woman would come in to the house with another woman. And if he had got rid of Mary Kate. The window would have been. Shut. No, he's. You had your chance. You plugged it. Later Guest Beach would be the location for the initial free races. It is here that a trick is played on Red Will. He's convinced that if he lets his sister Mary Kate get married, then he'll be in with a chance with the object of his own affections. The widow to learn. Every marriageable woman in the town ties her bonnet to the finish post that the winning writer might take his pick. It was a sequence designed to bring some scale to the little Irish story. The film that Herbert Jr. Yates in Hollywood had already written off as a failure. In one morning. Ford did not show up for work. Wayne would later recall that he went back to Ashford Castle and found his director sick in bed, suffering from exhaustion. He said he was unable to carry on. Word spread through the cast and crew that something was seriously wrong. The naysayers were right, it seemed. Filming would come to an end and the project would be abandoned. An expensive embarrassment. But John Wayne had an idea. He would direct the beach scenes until Ford felt strong enough to return. Content you took your. John Wayne had saved the day. Ford returned to work, but the atmosphere on the set remained fraught. Even fell out briefly with his beloved Mary Kate. Only one time I insulted him. We were doing a scene and my hair was blowing and blowing the wrong way. And he didn't want it. And I kept blinking, you know, and in the sun. And he kept yelling at me and yelling at me to keep my so-and-so. And I won't use the words he used. Keep my so-and-so eyes open. Why do they keep my eyes open? And I finally reached a point where I couldn't take it anymore. I couldn't stand it. And I put my hands on my knees and I leaned forward and I yelled at him and I said, What with an old son of a bitch like, you know, about keeping your eyes open and all a bald headed son of a bitch Like you know about keeping your eyes open in the sun. And when I said it, I thought, Oh my God, I'm going to be fired or assassinated or something. What am I going to do? What am I going to do? And the whole company gasped. You could hear them. Nothing moved. Nobody. Everybody there didn't even dare breathe because they thought that's the end of Maureen. He's going to kill her. And. He started to laugh. And everybody thought, Oh, thank God she's safe. She's safe. And it was amazing. When's the happy day? Sarah, darling. Hi. You lost a little since you were born with. Heavy gain in the darling. Darling me cod. Who gave you the right to make such an announcement? They trick Victor Maguire going into. Approving of the marriage and there was a conspiracy of the priest and the minister and other people. They're too clever and it backfires on them. This is from the Congress. Now, whatever. Now get out of here. What? The Reverend, Sir. Ladies and gentlemen, get up. All right. There. The whole. I must go. God bless. Without my fortune. It's mine. Mine and my mother's before me. And I'm not the money being from the floor. It's an insult. I mean, you cannot stay in that. You cannot stay in that area unless you deal with that. You may not win it, but you've got to deal with it. The thing about the Quiet Man is that it's a it's a very deceptive film. And it's a film where before the film starts, John Wayne has killed somebody in a fair fight. So Wayne has killed somebody in a fair fight in America. So he comes to Ireland basically as a killer, as a need, a character who's coming back to the land of his bird, like Oedipus in the Greek myth. And Ford was coming back to kind of say, look, here's the guy. He's been to America, He's John Wayne. He's coming back and he's not coming back to free Ireland politically, but he's coming back to free the soul of Ireland. And Maureen O'Hara from the oppressive, bloody family that she lives in. Ford added the detail to the Walsh, saying Nothing in Walsh hits. It hints at what ultimately happened. He gave Ford the back story of a prizefighter who's killed his opponent in the ring. That was all Ford. John Thornhill. Tony out for lousy money. A piece of the purse. He thinks that killing the man was horrible. What we see in that flashback is that it's the America that uses this as grist for a commercialized mill of sensationalistic advertising and cheap print journalism. That that symbolizes the falsity and the hollowness of the of the the the values to which Ireland in the film is the entire antithesis. Had a little bit to do there with to a raging bull actually in the I want to the effect in the fight scenes to look like the color flashback in quite man but of course I was doing in black and white but there was something about the clarity of the way the photographs are taken and the way John Wayne is standing there and the emerald green trunks. There's just something the way we shot. It's obviously a flashback. It's obviously slightly stylized, but it's real. It's not dreamlike. And so I wanted it was a kind of inspiration, I should say, for a lot of what I want it to be in Raging Bull. It's a terrible thing. It kills a man and a marine, and he's a good man, Sean, you know, and it's hard to live with himself afterwards. So he goes back to his roots and then he has to be accepted in those roots and within those roots. And he has to then he has to play out the ritual. It is a pretty cottages. Yeah. I think so. Don't touch me. You have no right. What do you mean, no? Right. I'll wear your ring. I'll cook and I'll wash. And I keep the land. But that is all until I've got my dowry safe about me. I know a married woman and a servant. I have always been without anything. Of my own. That's ridiculous. You're my wife and fortune. What is this? Mary Kate Tanner is a very forward, powerful woman and she wants to get on with her life and she wants to progress, but she doesn't want to go on doing that without the respect of the traditions. She doesn't want to go to the man she loves unless the tradition is observed that she's given the respectability of a dowry so she can say in the future years, Fight says, I brought my own money into this house. Father Lonergan is enjoying a quiet afternoons fishing when Mary Kate barges in to confess that she hasn't been granting her husband his conjugal rights. This sort of talk, even within the confines of marriage, was definitely out of bounds in a Hollywood film at the time. As a tip of the hat to the language of his parents and a middle finger raised in the direction of the Census forward as Mary Kate discussed her frustration in Irish. His cousin Nora was recruited as a language consultant. Paula. Shall we get a deal? My big girl Gaga chick, avoid mess. Come out of this Cash out again. Industry shareholder Sharon Goodyear. She shared kind of getting it out here. But he used to pretend he could speak Gaelic and he knew a few words. Yes. And he'd say something. And it was my duty to say, Oh, sure, sure, sure, sure, sure. And I'd have to see it. And he'd say, Oh, we were chatting in our language, and he'd say to the crew, and they didn't know any different, and they believed it. And I wouldn't have dared say what he said was rubbish. She assured him on a piece of railcar and holler. But my mind didn't have a frenetic arc to call a mollycoddle. I just don't know how to start to yet up on the idea. She's just mediocre. I was so chair for Greiner and then. Oh, near near Lake Mi MacInnis, Lebanon. A rare Kurmi funeral home. Holy. He. Ooh, it looks good. Shop at the shed bag. Sleeping bag. Father with. But it's. Ms.. NEARY Charen, unpack. A lot of American viewers, I think, have trouble understanding the concept of the dowry, because we don't have that over here. And I know that sometimes the film has had a certain negative attitude expressed toward it by Americans who thought that Mary Kate was being obstinate or difficult about, you know, why does she care so much about her property and she's being mercenary, etc.. They don't really understand the traditional nature of the down rule, how it represents the woman's property and her individuality. So I think people have to understand that custom. And it's explained in the film. Frank Nugent, who wrote the script, takes pains to explain the custom because John Wayne doesn't understand it in the film. And so the audience needs to respect her wishes for her dowry, even though it's an old fashioned custom. That you see here. That pretty. Now is a good time to ask him. Well. Go on. Go on. Ask him. What about my money? He can't say that. He hasn't got it with him now. Can't you get it through your head that I didn't marry you for your fortune? Then there's a fella going around there in the jumping car, and he was telling me that the Americans were on the. In the jumping car this autumn. Oh, this is. This is like the the to the poverty and the trap in the car. No, this is the pony and the trap and the quiet man. This is the same one that was used to quite, man, you know. And I said, Did you believe the best? Said, How good after 50 years that going be? The same horse horses on the 20 years. Put that to believe the man, you know. So I think they come to they come here just to hear all this. You to hear the Irish people tell them lies, everything to do. They enjoy it. You know, I have to close down because I have got I have to go somewhere else to drop by, you know? He's a quiet man because he killed somebody in the boxing ring. He's the quiet man because he doesn't want to fight. He's had his fill of fighting in the. Had a tough childhood. His parents had a tough job. Tough life. So he wants to come back to peace, Quaid's peace with his childhood home and with Ireland. How would it be if I put one of your fists in my pocket? Going right to left are you choose, you're going to go. And that's fair enough, isn't it? Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! They're fighting, don't you? Oh. The situation that was created when the Yank comes back and falls in love with the Squire sister. Chris, Consternation is free. The priest can solve it. Uh, the vicar has some ideas that there has to be the new man here. There has to be a conflict here to solve it. But basically, Nog knows we're taught to refuse to fight the first time because it drops his head, and he's kind of lamenting the old order. What has happened to our men? But they won't fight. No. What's America made of our men? What sort of man is it that's come back? It must be a damaged different man from the man that left here from his people. It was an embarrassment to his race for McLean that the taunted wouldn't face. All this talk about her big fortune. It's not that important. It is to her. It must be strange to you from America. What is the old custom here? And believe me, it's a good custom. Well, at that. Point, there catalyzes crystallizes two different ideas of marriage. One is the American idea of marriage, where two particles floating in a social void unite and call that a marriage. And the other is the Irish idea of marriage. It's the idea that. She is being integrated into her own society as a married woman, and that he, if he only understands the ground rules, will be integrated into the Irishness that he's left and still doesn't fully understand because he still he still thinks that he's operating out of what he calls mercenary motives. All he can do is see her. For most of the film, with American eyes. And that has to be purged. That has to be purged. That's what the donnybrook scene is about. Ford brought Shaun Thorne to diminish free by train, dropped him into a world of old rules and strange traditions and left him to find his own way through the maze. Just as Shaun's journey began at the station here, it almost ends. To deserve his reward. The heart of the best woman in Innisfree. The quiet man must fight one more battle. Mary Kate is leaving him. But before the train can depart, she's intercepted by Sian as she hoped she would be. And so begins the last chapter of the film. Finally, Sean Thornton knows what to do. He drags Mary Kate the length of Innisfree and deposits her at the feet of her brother. It's a scene both loved and reviled, reckoned by many to be a product of thoughtless sexism on the part of the film's director. But Ford knew exactly what he was doing. This is Ford's version of a very ancient ritual in when two clans were marrying one from each clan. They had a mock battle in Ancient in medieval Ireland, and they rode up and brandished spears at each other. And there were fights. And then the bridegroom rode forward and took home the bride. And then both clans reunited. And it was this was actually called Dragging Home the Bride. That's what it was called in ancient in early medieval Ireland. We didn't know that. Don't you got a drag? I see. I guess, yeah. And it gets me angry to think of people judging it and against it this way when you don't know where it comes from and who they are, you really don't know who they are. Like, you're taking it as a movie. It's not a movie. I mean, it's a story. And it's a work of art. It's a it's a work of poetry. And and it's a very unique and beautiful. Like you. I want to find out what to me what one person said it appeared because it lowered the prestige of the Irish people. You know that there he was by the head or the head, like you can't put new logo. You know, he caught her by the hair. He dragged her. Well, that's what the cavemen used to long ago. That's what appealed to this. But then she was the kicker, huh? If it were a scene about physical violence only there would be nothing but dragging. But that scene is punctuated with sundae parlor politics. Morning. Then she's being dragged along farther and she loses her shoe. You lost your shoe. How do you make. And an awful lot of politeness and ceremony, one would think, for the middle of a violent scene that was violent for the sake of violence. Shot. Here's a good stick to. Thank the lovely lady. Thanks. Here's a good stick to beat the lovely lady with. She's handing him a stick to beat his wife with, which would in itself be reprehensible. And the phrase lovely lady, which means I'm welcoming, welcoming her back into the community into which he was born. We know what this is about. We know in our bones that he's going to go and fight her brother. There will be a donnybrook. There will be a reintegration into the community. And they know that Maureen O'Hara knows that because she wouldn't be thanking people for. Thank you kindly, sir. The stick to beat the lovely lady with. That was John Ford's type of direction. Which the whole audience understood. And knew what it meant. Maybe you didn't, but the audiences did. You can take your sister back. It's your custom, not mine. No fortune, no marriage. We call it quits. It's like something out of mythology. And Ford was a. You know, aficionado of mythology. He knew all about it. And the mythic elements to the movie are no accident. The idea that he has to conquer. He has to go through tests like Hercules to get the one he loves. The birds agree. There's your daddy money. Take it. Count it. Just fine. I look, if ever I see that face of yours again, I'll push that through it. Charge it. I'll be going on home now. I'll have the supper ready for you. Within an inexpressible jaunty ness. She walks away down the hill in the crowd hearts before her. And you've got a picture of a woman perfectly integrated into her, reintegrated into her society. She knows it, the townspeople knows it, know it. And Sean Thornton. Except that he's got one little bit of business to get out of the way, which is beating his brother in law senseless. Knows it as well. All through. After almost 20 years of fighting for it and never compromising, John Ford finally completed his film. All 129 minutes of it. When the picture was made and put together and Herb Yates saw it, he didn't believe in long movies and he said, it's too long. Have to cut the picture down. And so Ford, instead of arguing, said, fine, I'll do that. And all the exhibitors had come to the studio to look at what product they had for them to rent or hire for their theaters. And so Ford showed them The Quiet Man and he cut the end of the movie off so that you didn't know what the finish was. You didn't know whether Mary Kay and Sean Argent got together or not. And they all rose up as one. All the execs, all the studio types got up and said, You can't stop it there, for God's sake, what's going on? And so on and so forth. Herbert Yates looked around him and realized he had his own donnybrook on his hands. Well, give a man a hand and. And so Herb Yates ordered Ford to show them the whole movie. And so that's how the movie stayed all together in one movie. How about a drink. Before you kill yourself? The drink would be on the house. That's a good idea. The people from Valley are coming over by bus. Holmes is with them. All right. That's a good idea. God, I'm tired, mind you. They look more like a black eyed. And still the tourists keep coming. Cohan's Bar, which wasn't really a bar, is now a bar. Jack and Nancy have handed over the premises to younger relatives, and fantasy has become reality. Of a sort. Bartel. What time is it? Hyperspace, sir. Breath of fresh air at the house of Cohan. Come on in. He was born and bred in. In a place called Castle, Maine. The Quiet Man is that rare thing in Ford's film. It's a romantic love story, and it's a comedy. And so a comedy means a happy ending. Everybody's very up at the end. That's what the story is for. It ends with something transcendent. The shots of all the villagers and Wayne and O'Hara running off together, she whispered something in his ear. You don't know what she was. She refuses to tell anybody what she said. So we'll never know what she said. It has something to do with sex. I had a feeling because Wayne has an interesting reaction. I know what you're going to ask. Go ahead, ask it. I'll. I'll. I'll behave and listen. But you know what your answer is going to be? But how do. What happened in the from your instruction to. Instructed me to say something to Duke and I did what I was supposed to do. And to this day, they never told and I will never tell. But Ford got the look from Duke that he wanted. Of course, we never know the secret words. John Ford told Maureen to whisper into John Wayne's ear. It's enough to know that Sean and Mary Kate lived out their days happily employed way mourn. Cottage itself has since fallen down. But only in reality. You'd be driving home and you had just spent a day working with him. And your feelings as you drove home was, My God, I'm good. I'm magnificent. I'm going to be the biggest star in Hollywood because he might have been mad at you. He might have destroyed you and insulted you, but he also gave you great confidence in yourself. Believe me, I would rather work with the Pardon me, the old bastard, than not. He was magnificent. John Ford went on to make other films, some of them masterpieces. Hollywood had changed. It became harder and harder to make his kind of films. And then impossible. But the quiet man abides. You don't have to be Irish to hear the far off music of Innisfree. That dream of home. We're all wounds are here and all sins forgiven. Sean Martin Feeney died in 1973. His phone. Didn't. Cut.
