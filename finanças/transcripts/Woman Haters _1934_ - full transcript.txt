[♪] [GAVEL POUNDS] MAN: Gentlemen, please, the meeting is called to order, and we need quiet, not a riot. Otherwise, we can't proceed. Listen, you Woman Haters, we meet for the seventh time to convince each member of the club that romance is a crime! If you have any questions or any suggestions that you'd like to make today, or if you have a notion to offer a motion, let's hear what you have to say. Come, speak up like a hero. Your speech need not be rehearsed. Who's that? Oh, yes, it's Mr. Zero. \h\h\h\h\hAll right. I'll speak up first. [APPLAUSE] I'll give you my opinion \hof the opposite sexes. When a man marries a girl, \h\hhe has to work while she relaxes. Some smart aleck wrote a book \h\h\h\hThe Woman Always Pays. \h\h\hYeah, she pays for perfume, powder, paint and every silly craze. \h\h\hBut where does the money come from? From those dopey guys \h\h\h\h\h\hwho fall. \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hI say down with every guy who sings, "My Life, My Love, \h\h\h\h\hMy all." Gentlemen, gentlemen, those in favor say "aye." \h\h\hMEN: Aye. Aye. CHAIRMAN: All right, we'll pass that by. \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hMr. Chairman, three gentlemen wait without. Without what? They wanna join our club today. Okay, admit them \h\hright away. [♪] In the name of the Woman Haters Club, I welcome you. Do you three gentlemen understand what you're expected to do? Now, boys, relax. I said, relax. Now, please, at ease. Relax, relax! I didn't tell you to break your backs. Stand up for the initiation. Please. Please. Don't do that. CHAIRMAN: \hLet go! [CHAIRMAN GRUNTING] \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hCHAIRMAN: \hI pronounce you members of the Woman Haters Club! \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hALL: Hurray! Hurray! Hurray! \h\hFellas, I'll have to quit that club I joined last week. BOTH: Quit the club?! \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hThat's what I said. Why, you big fathead, \h\hwhat do you mean? \h\h\h\hIt's this way: I met a beautiful girl \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hand fell head over heels in love. Why, you must be outta your mind. You're crazy. \h\h\h\hWhat're you thinking of? \h\h\h\hBut I promised to marry her tonight. \hBOTH: Tonight? \hWhy, if you violate the rules of the club, you're just as good \h\h\h\h\h\has dead. If you get married, you'll be carried out and clubbed right on the head. \h\hDown with the traitors of the Woman Haters Club. \h\h\h\h\h\h\hFellas, you've convinced me. \h\h\h\h\hI guess that you're right. I'll have to call the wedding off. I'll tell her tonight. That's fine, but how can we be certain you won't give us the double-cross? I'll put up my bankroll. \h\h\h\h\hIf I miss, I'll take the loss. I got a better idea \h\h\h\h\hthan that. I'll tell you what let's do. \h\h\h\hJackie, me and you put up our bankrolls too. \hWe'll sign an agreement \h\h\hthat we three will stick together for life and never even look at a girl \h\h\h\hand never take a wife. Now that you've signed, \h\hplease bear in mind, \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hfrom now on, no women around of any kind. Right? \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hRight. Now the forfeit \h\hwe'll post. Fill 'em up. \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hFill 'em up. Now I'll make a toast. \h\h\hTo the three musketeers, who've stuck along for years, \hwe've traveled together in every kind of weather. \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hRight? Right. \h\hWhat've you got to say for yourself? Me? \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hYou. I've got plenty to say for myself. [HICCUPS] I beg your pardon, mates. Here's to the finest salesmen in the whole United States. Say, by the way, don't we leave \h\h\h\h\h\hfor the row tonight? \h\h\h\hWhat day is this? The 21st. \h\hBy golly, you're right. Let's hurry back. \h\h\h\h\h\hWe gotta pack our samples for the trip. Okay. Before we go, let's take another sip. \h\h\hHere's to our trip. \hYou'd better see your girl and offer her your sympathy. Tell her that the bride-to-be \h\h\his not the bride-to-be. \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hRight? Right. [HICCUPS] \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h[HICCUPS] [BELCHES] Rain or shine or rain, I'll meet youse at the train. And now I'll tell the lady that I'll never see her again. \h\h\h\h\h[IRISH ACCENT] \h\hDaughter, it's late. Have you heard from Jim? Now, Dad, he'll be here. \hDon't worry about him. But the people \hare waitin'. Oh, here he comes now. \h\h\h\h\hHello, Jim. Can I see you privately \h\h\hin the next room? \h\h\h\hNot now, dear. What's troubling you? Why all the gloom? Friends of the family... meet the groom. \h\hAw, congratulations. [GUESTS CHATTERING] Come on, son-in-law, \hlet's have a drink. Well, here's to the happiest ending. Gee, I don't feel so hot. Go on, you're joking. Sure you're pretending. Honestly, father, \h\h\h\h\hI'm not. That reminds me of a story. Listen. That's me other daughter there. Well, on her wedding day, the fellow she was about to marry tried to run away. Did you ever hear of a nerve like that? Well, I took care of that guy. In a room, I locked him, then I socked him right in the eye. Then I turned him over to me brother, the cop. He just picked him up and spinned him around like a top. Then me other brother, who's a fighter, began. Son, I'm ashamed to tell you what he did to that man. \hDid he marry your daughter? \h\h\h\h\h\hDid he? I should say he did. \hThere he is right over there. He'll be walking soon, poor kid. Oh, Jim, let's go. \h\h\h\hRight now? Yeah. [GROANS] \h\h\h\h\h\h\hGood luck. Let's go. [JIM GROANS] [♪] Jim, do you take Mary... ["HERE COMES THE BRIDE" PLAYS] ...for your lawful wedded wife? I do. Mary, do you promise \h\h\h\hto love him, \h\h\h\hshare his joy and share his strife? Oh, I do. \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hMINISTER: Place the ring upon her finger. \h\hNot that one, the other finger. I pronounce you \hman and wife. [CROWD CHEERING] [♪] \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hHoney, we're two hours early. \h\h\h\hWhy did we get here so soon? Just so we can be alone for a while, alone on our honeymoon. \h\h\h\h\hOh, darling, you're so thoughtful. Catch on? \h\hYou bet I do. Is that all, sir? Yeah, that's all that I want with you. \h\h\hWe're away from the crowd. Oh, dear, oh, dear. Whew, what a relief. Here you are.

What do you say? \h\h\h\hWhy, the idea. Are you ashamed of me? \h\h\h\h\h\h[TEARFULLY] Oh, you're starting out \h\h\h\h\hin a nice way. \h\h\h\hDoll, I might meet some friends on the train \h\hthat'll try to kid me along. \h\h\hI dare them to kid you along.
