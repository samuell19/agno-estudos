Are you sure, Sasthi? Miss? Miss? Miss Sasthi? You are Miss Sasthi, right? Wulan. My name is Wulan. Miss! Just a second! Atmi Sasthi Wulandari? We need your help. I'm begging you. This is important. Why hasn't the warden informed us? I know. We've been waiting and he's ignoring us. There they are! Come on! Sir, are you transporting Ananta's corpse? Sir, please step aside. Miss, move away. Please give us some answer. Yes, there will be time for questions. Now please make way. Sir, Miss, we need to get through. Please make way. Sir, where is Ananta now? Make way! Make way! / Please wait, Sir! Miss, this way. MORGUE Miss Sasthi? I'm Rudi. I'm the warden of this prison. We have executed your father. But your father... Your father is still not dead. My goodness! Hey, help her! Get her off! We heard him whisper. Only... My descendant... ...can end my life. So we're asking you a favor. We're begging you. To let your father rest in peace. Miss. So what will it be? If we don't settle this until tomorrow morning... ...we'll have to come up with another plan. Because frankly... ...I don't know what to say to the media. Since we have executed him twice. And we still failed. Goodness. What's with the electricity? Tepan! Come here. Lock all the exits. Don't cause panic. / Yes, Sir. Turn on the generator. Guards! Come here! Call everyone! Guards! Don't move! Surrender! Sasthi, memorize my favorite song. Look at me. Let's sing together. Ready? Where are you? Where is Sasthi? Under... The light... ...of the full moon. There she is! Father, I want that. This one? This just arrived. Sasthi, you want this? Should I buy it? / Buy it! No. / Buy it! Maybe I shouldn't. / Buy it! You want it? / I do. Then... I'll buy it. Thank you, Father. / You're welcome. This is C. Let me try. Like this? / Yes. Now try to play something. That Ananta has claimed another victims. Horrible. / True. Three dead, two in critical condition. Miss! This is no public place. Please wait outside. Excuse me, Sir. I'm Jayanthi, a reporter from Metro Pos. I'm just here to cover Ananta's execution. Please, Miss. Wait for the announcement. Now you wait outside. How was the execution? Did it went well? Wait outside! Was there any trouble? I don't know. Are you sure there wasn't any trouble? I heard some kind of gunshot from inside the prison. Wasn't the execution supposed to take place outside the prison? It was the generator exploding. And that woman inside the car? How is she related to Ananta? Is she his daughter? Miss, please wait outside. Sir, one more question. Is it true that Ananta has mastered a dark art? Miss, all convicts claim that they have supernatural power. But Ananta was different. How many families has he slaughter? Miss, enough! Okay? Come, Miss. Get out. Sir, I just need… / Wait outside! Miss Sasthi. Your father once told us. For his body to be taken to his hometown in Cimacan. But to be more practical... ...we decided to bury him in the prison's cemetery. If one day the family want to move him to Cimacan... ...we will gladly help. Don't take him to Cimacan. So we'll bury him here, Miss? If Father... Wanted to be buried in Cimacan... ...we better take him there. So what's your decision? You want him to be buried here or in Cimacan? Because frankly, I can only call the men... ...and the hearse after lunch. I'm concerned. Won't it take too long? Just do as my father's wish. Goodness. Miss, please wait. Ma, wake up. Ma. Wake up. Wake up, come on. What is it? / Is the car ready? We're doing it? / Yes. Where's the car, Ma? I've prepared the car. I thought it's cancelled. We're doing this. Hurry. Fine. / Hurry. Miss. I'm sorry, Miss. I thought... It was cancelled. Is it? Okay then. Miss Sasthi. I've coordinated things with Cimacan village's chief. And a grave for Mr. Ananta has been prepared. Careful on the road, Ma. Don't forget to pray first. You should arrive at dusk. I've checked the map in my phone. All the tollways are crowded. Red lines all over. So we have to take the regular road. Fine. It's slower, but safer. Yeah. / Careful. Miss, your father's inside. Be careful on your... People have died because of this case. Come on. What's so hard about transporting a corpse? Come on, relax. Come, Miss. Have a nice trip, Miss. If you want a second portion... ...go ahead. It's on me. Thank you, Miss. Relax, Sir. / Yes. Sir, I saw a number of ambulances last night. And I saw some of the guards were taken to the hospital. They were just having a fever. Really? They need to be taken with ambulances? Well... That's how it was. Just a minute, Sir. / Yes. Mr. Dodi? I'm still waiting at the prison. According to my inside man... ...Ananta will be buried in his hometown. His execution is confirmed. What more angle are you looking for? In a crime case, when the criminal's dead, it's done! But, Sir, according to my sources... ...they believe that Ananta has mastered the art of Banaspati. A dark art that prevents the user from dying. Unless they are buried in their hometown... ...the users can return from the dead. I just want to make sure that... These sources you're talking about are Ghoib magazines? I just found them on your desk! Yan! We are a serious media! Not a paranormal media! Are you insane? The readers will laugh at us! I don't think any of the victim's family are laughing, Sir. Okay. I know that one of his victims was you best friend. But come on, enough of this. We have a more important work... Hello? Damn it! Miss Sasthi, right? My condolences, Miss. Thank you. Yama. I'm Yama. Thank you, Yama. If you want to sleep, go ahead. It seems that... ...you're exhausted. I've had some rest. At Mr. Rudi's office. Are you a musician? You play ukulele? I do. Amazing. Nothing special. If the traffic is smooth... At 9 PM... ...we'll arrive there. Master, what are you doing? Here, grooming my bird. Well, excuse me then, Master. / Please, please. Chief, where are you going? Chief? Chief? Come over, have some coffee. Nanta. Miss, excuse me. I need to go to the toilet. Miss? Alright then. Excuse me, Ma'am. I need to use your toilet. It's in the back, Son. Go ahead. / Thank you. Smells good. What are you cooking? It's just some fries, Son. I'll have some, for the road. What a coincidence, they're still hot. Excuse me. It's occupied. Goodness! Gosh! It's occupied! Didn't you hear me? What is this? Good afternoon, Miss. Miss Sasthi? Ananta's daughter? My name is Jayanthi, Metro Pos. May I ask you some question? Is Ananta being taken to his hometown? Is it true that Ananta has mastered the dark art of Banaspati? Miss Sasthi? Just a minute, Son. The fries are almost ready. Be patient. Ma'am. Did you... Hear a woman's cry? That was probably my daughter. We're sorry. Please understand. She's scared. Scared of what, Ma'am? Afraid of that person at the back of your car. That man, he's an evil person. Please take him away from here. The town folks here, we all hate him. Leave! Never come back! Miss? You won't say anything because you're hiding something? We have to go now! Miss Sasthi? Please answer my question! Is it true that Ananta has mastered the dark art of Banaspati? Miss Sasthi! What's wrong? There was... There was what? Nothing. Nothing happened. Who was that woman? A reporter. Asking about my father. Is she following us? Seems so. And that chief seems confused. I really don't want to deal with Chief Dirman. True. I met the Chief ealier. See? / He looked confused and different. Dirman has never hit me, this is the first time! Hey, what's happening? It's Mumun. The Chief hit her. Goodness. Mumun. What happened? / Master! Can you imagine? Dirman hit me! That's impossible! Dirman wouldn't hit a woman! Master! What do you mean impossible? I'm the one who got hit! Listen, Master. He received a phone call, and he started acting weird. I'm sure. It was a call from his first wife! And she told him to hit me! Don't be sad, Mumun. Just cheat on him. Marry me, Engkus. No, I'm just trying to come up with a pollution. Shut up! Mun... Dirman's first wife is in Cianjur. I don't know, Master. All I know, Dirman's attitude changed. He looked confused. Then he went to the cemetery. Then after he returned... ...he got angry He hit me. Now I don't know where he is! Calm down. Hey, what are you doing? If you change your mind… ...give me a call, okay? I'm ready. Just give me a code in your status, I'll give it a like. Break it up! Calm down. Where's Dirman, Master? I don't know as well. I'll look for him, okay? That reporter... She asked about Banaspati? You know about that? An old gossip about Father. They say he had a supernatural power. Is that true? I don't trust such things. All I know that Father was kind to me. Sorry, Miss. Back then at the food stand... What? I didn't mean to... There's my father at the back. Go ask him. Why drag me into this? All I know that Father was kind to me! Come on. This goat is stubborn. Come on, you'll get fatter. Chief? Finally, we will soon witness the super blood moon. A natural phenomena often related to mysticism. An occurrence where the full moon becomes red. This midnight... ...don't forget to pray, and look up the sky. Don't miss this event... Or you will regret it. I need to pull over. I need to pee. Miss Sasthi, I just need a short story about the burial. Miss Sasthi... What more do you want? Is it not enough that my father was executed? Our readers need... I just want my father to rest in peace. Victims' families also need peace! I'm also a victim! You think I'm happy to see my father kill people? What is this? This woman! You've been following us. Miss Sasthi, you wait in the car. Let me take care of it. What do you want? I have the right for an interview. You know about the freedom of press, right? Yes, I know this is a free country. Free to do anything. Apologize later, right? I just want to make sure Ananta will be buried. Dead people will surely be buried, Miss. You expect us to take him to the movie? Fine. Then you wouldn't mind me examining the corpse, right? Be my guess. But promise me. After this, don't bother us anymore. Don't you feel bad about Miss Sasthi? Okay, deal. I won't bother you anymore. Fine. Please. Please. Sir? Why's the door locked? Jerk! Dear! / May we talk for a minute? What is it? The folks want to talk. Excuse me. What is it? / Here. What's with this cell phone? For me? That was the late Chief's phone. It was in his pocket. It fell when he hung himself. So why are you giving it to me? Give it to Mumun. She's the inheritor. Give it to her. It's not that, Master. Someone called this number. The prison warden. We're just guessing. We think... It's related to Nanta's burial in this village. What does that have to do with me? What? / Since he received the phone call... ...the chief started acting weird. We suspect... ... this has something to do with Nanta's supernatural power. Look, Master Endang. You are the revered one in this village. Besides, you were Nanta's senior. The point is, the whole village agreed… ...to prevent Nanta to be buried in this village. Because we don't want to meet the same fate as the Chief. There. Is she still following us? No, Miss. Miss. I have to take an alternative road. But it's a road less traveled. Thank you. You're welcome, Miss. Stop calling me Miss. Call me Sasthi. Is that so? Okay then. Then... Please don't call me Miss. Just call me Yama. But actually... For those who are deceased... It's over. We better not disturb them. Isn't that right? What's wrong? What's wrong? I checked everything before we leave. Everything was fine. This too. My GPS... We're suppose to have passed this point. Mine too. My signal's... It's bad. Mine too. Here, hold this. Put his head in the right position. Place him right. No other god but Allah. Lift him carefully. Dear! Dirman! Goodness! Allah, we beg your forgiveness. Master, help her. What's wrong with Mumun? Whose voice is that? Who are you? Excuse me, Brother. It's me. Under the light... ...of the full moon. Shimmering is the ocean. What a relieve, no more disturbance. Disturbance? Nothing. It was nothing. You play music well. Father taught me. Really? You're surprised? Amazing. Hey, someone's coming. Come. Excuse us. We need your help. Our car broke down. We need your assistance if it's not too much trouble. Gosh, this is a deserted area. It's hard to find repair shops or tow trucks. None here. Then, what's around here? In places like this... There's... Me. You're not helping, Boss. What's the problem? That's the thing. I don't know either. Have you tried pushing it? That's right. Let's push it. We'll help. Let's push. I'll help. Yes. / I'll help. Yes, wait. Sasthi, you can drive a car, right? Can you drive stick? Okay, you can. Sasthi. Wait for my signal to start the engine. Yes? / Okay. Come on. One, two, three. So heavy. Not yet. Wait. It's an uphill! Corpse! Don't eat Dadang! He still owe me money! Don't eat him! Let's run! Brothers! Wait! Please help us! Help us! I don't care if you killed people or anything. All I know is that you're my father. I just want you by my side. Sas. Let's put your father back in the car. Alright? Sas. The car. It's working. You're nuts. Are you gonna start singing or what? Wait. You said you wanna sing? Now what? / Okay, I don't care anymore. Excuse me, Sir. Yes, Miss? Is this the road to Cimacan? That's right, Miss. Just go straight ahead. About 5 kilometers, you'll see an intersection, then go right. After you pass the tea plantation... ...just go another 30 kilometers. Okay, thank you. / You're welcome, Miss. Let's continue. Just a minute. Pocong! Hey, Dang! What are you doing back here? We saw a ghost. Not a ghost, a pocong! Around a kilometer from here... ...there's a car with a pocong inside! That pocong got up... ...and tried to eat me! Eat you? Are you talking about a pocong or a lion? Hold on. Was it a prison car? Yes. I don't know. She was asking for a direction. Perhaps she's a psychic. How can you tell? / She knows. What's with all this noise? Pocong! Pocong? This is my roll pillow, not a pocong. And why do you have to pass out there? Pass out there, more comfortable. Dang, let's move inside. It smells gasoline. Is this the right way? I hope so. I predict... In one and a half hour... We'll arrive at... Wait, wait. Why didn't I see this? No signal? How's your phone? Fine, you just wait in the car. I'll go get some help. Sasthi. Don't forget to lock the door. Stay safe, okay? How do you feel? Better? I feel better, Master. Thank goodness. Back then, at the cemetery... ...do you remember what you said? What did I say? You don't remember? No, I don't. That's good. Now, I'll take my leave. Get some rest, don't think too much. Alright? / Yes, Master. I'll be going now. Yes. / May peace be upon you. And upon you as well. Take care. Thank you. Sasthi. Come, Child. Forgive me. I left... ...when you were so young. I don't want to hurt you. You're my only treasure. I love you so much. Sas... You have to hurry. Don't be late. Alright? Why, Father? You have to hurry, alright? Brothers, excuse me... Sasthi! Father? Father? Sasthi! Father? Hurry! Sasthi! Open the door! Sasthi! Hurry! It won't start! / Hurry! Start the engine! We're here for Ananta. We're here for Ananta. She passes out! What to do? Help me carry your father's corpse! We switch cars. Come on! Sasthi, help me out! Hurry! Hurry! Ma, there's the road sign. CIMACAN 30 KM What's wrong? Ma! Why are we stopping? What now? Ma, start the engine! I didn't notice. We run out of gas. / Now what to do? Come on, Sas! Come on, Sas! Just a bit more! Enough, enough! I'd rather guard the prison. Sas, where are you going? To the toilet. Careful. Nobody's around. Excuse me. Don't look, don't look. Excuse me. Excuse me. Miss? Sasthi! Sas! Sasthi! Sas! Sasthi! Wake up! Sasthi! Evening. Excuse me. Can I come with you? Where have you been? We have to get out of here. No need to tell me! Wait! Are you the real Sasthi? Sorry, you're real. Why are we stoppping? Wait, I forgot. Yama? Have you been noticing? The closer we are to Cimacan... ...we see more weird stuffs. Yes. I think... It has something to do with your father. And his hometown. Then what? We turn back? I’ll do what you want. I want my father to rest in peace! I also need rest. People have been calling me the daughter of a murderer, a criminal. I’m tired too, Ma! Fine. We’ll take your father home. We’ll be there soon. Is this the right place? Hey, who are you? Open up! Who are you? We’re delivering Mr. Ananta’s corpse to be buried. Are you... Are you Sasthi? Are you? Are you? / Yes, I am Sasthi. It’s me, your uncle. Your father’s brother. Goodness, it’s you, Sasthi. What was that? Sounds like a girl’s scream. From that way. Come, let’s check. Calm down! How can I calm down! There’s a corpse next to me! Get out first. Move! / Come. Come. Sasthi, goodness. We have to... Bury your father immediately. But there is one problem. The people here in Cimacan refuse... ...Ananta to be buried here. Why, Uncle? This afternoon, something unusual happened. The village chief committed suicide. The people suspect... ...this must be supernatural. And related to... Ananta. Master. That’s nothing unusual. Perhaps he committed suicide... ...because he was stressed. How was your trip here? Did you experience anything weird? I was leaning on a corpse. Not weird enough? That’s not what I meant. Master. A lot of weird things happened. A lot? Sasthi. Banaspati Demon... ...that resides... ...inside Ananta’s body... ...will become stronger... ...during the full moon. If you... ...experienced weird things during your trip... ...that means... ...Banaspati Demon, wouldn’t let you... ...wouldn’t accept you... ...to bury Nanta in this land. Master. According to my sources... ...if within 24 hours, that murderer... He’s my father! Doesn’t get buried in his hometown, he will rise again. Is that true? Yes. Uncle. Yes, Dear? This is Father. Yes. My father. Yes, I know. Wait, wait. You said 24 hours? Your father drew his last breath... ...at 2.30 AM. Now is 2 AM, right? We still have half an hour. Now what? There is a way. Wait here. The art of Banaspati... ...since ancient times... ...has been mastered by many warriors... ...fighting against the invaders. But whoever acquired this art... ...will never stop... ...killing others. Our master was one of the last users of the Banaspati art. He was killed when he was sleeping. And they had to use an ancient kujang blade... ...a relic from Padjajaran Era. That night... ...Ananta was visiting from the city. Master! Hold on! Help! Master! Master, hold on! That night... ...Banaspati found a new home. To stop him... ...he must be stabbed with... ...this Padjajaran kujang. Do you understand, Dear? Uncle... Please don’t. I can’t stab him with that. Just stab him already! Let me do it! Shut up! This is about my father, not yours! Hey, your father killed my friend and his family! Is it not enough for you to kill my father? If you kill my father once again... ...you're the demon, not my father! Your dad is the demon! Silence! Sasthi! Do you agree? It's not like that. Master, come out! Who is it? Yeah, yeah! What is it? What is it? Speak one at a time! Our respectable Master, we've made it clear. All the folks here disagree if Ananta's corpse... ...is to be buried in this village. Isn't that right? / That's right! Why's the corpse still here? Calm down, we are taking care of it! The point is, we all disagree. Burn him! / He brings bad luck! Burn him! Calm down! Burn him! He brings bad luck! Am I right? Burn him! Burn him! Where is the corpse? My goodness! Forgive us, God! Truly, disaster will befall our village! Goodness. Please don't punish us... ...for all of our wrongdoings. Please forgive us! Please don't let disaster befall us! Please set us free from Your wrath. Goodness. Everybody calm down, alright? Go home. Lock your windows and doors. Go home. Where's' Sasthi? Sasthi? Wasn't she's at your house? Sasthi? The time is getting closer. She went this way. Forgive me, Father. I can't give you a proper resting place. Sasthi? Sasthi? Sasthi? Don't, Uncle. Please, Uncle. For the last time, please respect my father. There is no other way, Sasthi. Let's bury him now. Master, people wouldn't know... ...if we bury him here. Uncle! We have to do this, Sasthi! No, Uncle! Father must be buried properly! Uncle! Move aside! Come here! / Father! Run! Father! Yama, take her away! Father! Sasthi! Master Endang! Yama! Jayanthi! Watch out! Just now, behind you. Sasthi! Sasthi! Sas! Sasthi! Get her up! / Yes, Master! Sas, are you alright? Wait here. Yama, help me. Right, Master. This isn't... Yes, this is Dirman. Please help Sasthi, Brother. If I ever rise from the dead... ...it's definitely not me. It's Banaspati. I still have it. The Padjajaran kujang. The demon is getting stronger... ...under the full moon, Brother. I'm afraid... ...the kujang won't be enough. Please help Sasthi, Brother. Don't let... Banaspati... ...take over her body. Where's Sasthi?
