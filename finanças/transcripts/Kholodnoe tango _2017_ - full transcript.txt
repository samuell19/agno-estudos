When you leave, do not come back. Forget, that I loved you All the things... that you told me... "Herzegovina Flor!" .. Comrades officers ... ... and all the guests ... Favorite brand of tobacco of Comrade Stalin. Love is like torture. Love that does not survive the treason. It is... in my heart, and it can't be changed. This is so you can understand how serious everything is. Answer me. You hid that you knew her from childhood, way before the war. When the Red Army was stationed here, Laima recruited you. Then or after, answer to me, when? Laima recruited me? Are you out of your mind? Come on, Max. Did you met her? When Germans entered Lithuania. And even earlier, before the war. The citizens of Lithuania, the German army liberated you from the Soviet communist regime. Two years the Russian commissars and their assistants, Jews, tortured the Lithuanians. But now the Polish-Jewish violence has come to an end. Lithuanians will become free allies of Great Germany. Attention, all persons of Jewish nationality need ... ... gather in temporary detention centers. Put it on, baby. I'm not going anywhere! It is necessary, Leah, it is necessary, please?! OK? Mom!

He will decide on his own... Are we the first ones to whom Jewish houses are given? So you lived here? Yes. Laima, stop eaves dropping! I did not need to do that. Okay. Help the mother to set the table. All right. And show this boy where to wash his hands. Why do that? He knows himself. And how do you know? It is written on his forehead. It is written ... Don't tell me, what is written. Clear on that?! Clear. Is he going to live with us? He will or he will not ... He will spend the night here. Vinces! What did you think about him then? Did you think that he is brave? Or he is a passionate fond of Jews? Because he did not throw you out and did not turn you in. I did not think anything. I just wanted to live. Say "rabbit". What for? Well ... say "rabbit". Rabbit. I am checking. The Jews often burr. Hey, there, Vinces Hi, there, Accept the goods. Here it's ... bronze, silver. And some other kind of crap. Just do not know what exactly. It is all good. Tomorrow there will be more of that Okay, until then Take care Do not get so close to me! Do you understand? It will not work like that. Got it? I did not even think so. When they will throw you out, where will you go? I do not know. To look for my mom. My father said that she was shot, on the outskirts of the city. They shoot everyone there. I am sorry. But you knew that it would be so. There were very bad people among you They always deceived and robbed the Lithuanians. But I feel sorry for you. You do not trust me? I do not know. And if I ... ... I'll cut my hand, you can believe? He did not heat his stove. He sold all the coal. He was so greedy. Once in a frigid frost ... ... he climbed into the stove himself. Then he lit a match. What has become, we will not tell you. Is this your grandfather? No. This is Karl Marx. So it's not your grandfather. And you are taller Oh, yeah. And this way even more tall. Do you know how to dance? Come on. Remember. I have chosen you. Do you understand? Forever. Ãffnen! Open it! Open it immediately. Are there any Jews in the house? Nein. But this is a Jewish home. No. Where are the adults? There is no one here, Mr. Unterofitzer. True? Yes. Yes. And what's in there? Nothing. I want to look. Nicht verstehen. You're a traitor. Vinces, are you back? Listen, talk to her. She is in bed all day, she does not eat anything. What's wrong? Did he hurt you? Was it him ?! What did you do to her? Laima. Answer me! Answer me! Laima, what did he do to you? I'm asking you. Throw him out, throw out this Jew! That is it. There will not be more check points. Untie this bastard. So he won't choke. Forgive me. Please. It will never happen. It will never happen. Then it was dangerous to live in a house. -Her father took me to the farm to an old woman, from there I went to the forest to partisans ... -What a story. But in reality you lived near a bloody policeman, right? -Did he recruit you? -Nobody recruited me! -How so? I explained. I was hiding with the partisans. I wrote about this in the questionnaire. You read it. Well, yes. It was afterwards. When the Russians liberated Lithuania. Listen, what are we playing fools here? Answer me! With the support of the Red Army, Lithuania became a Soviet republic. And now, liberated from the fascist invaders, Lithuania returns to the family of Soviet people. The war with German fascism is not over yet ... I returned from the woods from the partisans. Many of them remained in the forest to fight against the Russians. Who were now called occupiers. As they formerly called the Germans. But I returned. I considered the Russian soldiers to be of my own. I did not know how I would live. I did not know, but ... but I was happy. I ran to the place where I last saw my mother. Of course, it was pointless. But I could not just not to go there. They fed us, the tramps. They put us into the trucks. Without asking whether we want to go to distant Russia. They said only that now Lithuania and Russia are one country. So we went ... Laima! Laima. Laima. Sit down, you. So that is how the Soviet Russia became my homeland. I had nowhere to live. I was afraid of going to Vinces. We, homeless boys, were gathered and taken to Russian orphanages. All right, Orphanage near Murmansk. Factory. Playing at the train stations. What's next? I already wrote. Why did you come back here after all these years? What for? It is too long to explain. Laima. Laima. Do you recognize me? Max, is it you? -Where did you come from? -Just came here It took you awhile to come back. I did not want to return. If you did not want to come back, why did you come? Because of you. In vain. And this one? Who is he to you? This fuck? Yes, yes. No one. We slept together. Tomorrow I'll forget. And that's is how you live now? Hey. Where are you going? Hey, beautiful. I knew you'd come back. And Martha, while she was alive, did not want to stay there. So after the war we moved to our old shack. I gave your house to the military. And Laima? Laima? She hates me. She does not even come. Lives on the factory's premises. That's how we live. Okay. See you later Hey, Max. Another thing is ... Write about me. In the newspaper. How I saved you from the Germans. All right What do you need? Why are you here? I like it. Really? Your hands are all swollen. Why did you come? I found work for you in our restaurant. -Really? -Well, yes. I remember you sang well. -Still remember? -Yes, but you will need to come to audition. Just do not expect to sleep with me for this. Look, I know I'm guilty, but ... ... why do not you forgive me? It will not happen. Never. Do you understand? Have you been singing for a long time? I started before I was born. Do you want a drink? Do you drink cognac? And why not? You don't have to sing, we are taking you. When you leave ... do not come back. Forget... that I loved you. All the things... that you told me ... The cigarettes! "Herzegovina flor". Comrades officers and all the guests. Favorite tobacco brand of Comrade Stalin. Love that looks like torture ... Love... it does not tolerate the betrayal... It is in my heart. There is nothing that ... can change that. Here you go. Comrade Commandant ... Let's try our song, like we did it the last time, remember? ... I marvel at the sky, and dream ... Two servings of chops for the Major. ... why don't I fly? Why didn't God give me wings? ... I'd fly into the sky! I saw you looking at each other. What did you do then? What did she want from you before the train left? Nothing. Only to have a smoke. What? I am asking you, what is it? Well? What did you want? Do you want to help? Are you doubting me? One Lithuanian is there in our laundromat. Her and her daughter are being deported to Siberia. So what? My husband worked for the Germans at the post office. What is her fault? In short ... Talk to him. To whom? To the Commandant. With Taratuta? He treats you well Even sings along with you. Are you out of your mind? Who am I to him? And what do I know about this friend of yours, Lithuanian? Mine? Well, not yours, of course. - You do not care that the Russians are sending half of Lithuanians to Siberia. - Do not start. I have something to say. Start it up. The Commandant will be leaving shortly. Give me a light. What's happening? Where? There! Oleg! They planned it, prior to the train departure, to assassinate you, Comrade Major. Go to the cars! Do not linger! Take things with you. One man - one suitcase. The rest of the items, leave behind. Violators will be punished. You can direct any of your complaints to the security officer while in transit. The Council of Ministers of the USSR decided on the next relocation from the territory of Lithuania ... ... the rich farmers, bourgeois nationalists, as well as their hidden accomplices in the number of 27 thousand families. All of them will be deported to designated settlements in the regions of Siberia and the Far East for undetermined amount of time. The workers and peasants of Soviet Lithuania warmly welcome such a decision of our Party ... ... and they see their future only in the state of the union of the Soviet people, building a bright communist future in our land. And the zealous nationalists and former accomplices of the Nazi invaders, who call themselves "forest brothersâ, who attack Soviet rule with arms ... ... the most stringent measures will be applied to them, including physical elimination. Wow ... Oh, what a woman. I am impressed. Why are you acting like that? What for? Are you hurt? Well, I'm glad. Every night new love and ... happiness. Every night is a different mouth ... Disappear! I am all set. Sit down! What did you do there? In the alley? I happened to be there. Come and work for me. I do not have enough people. Why me? You fit the position. You went thru war, orphanage, you are Komsomol member. You have driving license. Lithuanians, they ... Do you understand? Some of them are afraid. Some have shady past. They consider us occupiers and cause trouble. And you seem to be like local. But don't seem to be one of them. Excuse me. Thank you. But no. Do you know the Coal man? That is his nickname. Coal man. Former policeman for Germans. Do you know how many Jews he exterminated during the war? - He is still fighting against the Soviet State, arranges the brutal executions. - And what do I have to do with it? And who will be catching him? So, let the others ... ... risk their lives, while you're entertaining this fucking whore with your playing the accordion? And your mother's blood? And the sister's blood? Look at me! I agree. That's much better, son. I did not doubt you. This is a gift to you from me. Take it. It looks abandoned, don't see our guys. Answer who was it ?! I do not know them. Answer, bastard, where are our guys?! I do not know. I do not know. Where are our soldiers?! They came to your farm! Where are they?! I do not know. If you're lying to me, bastard ... Both of you, you hear me, I will hang both of you. There they are, in the barn. If anything happens to them, you'll die too, bastard. Oh, you The boys were young. Here is the war lesson. There are so many mistakes. There are so many mistakes. We need to understand. How then did our guys run into an ambush? Who told the bandits? Laima? -What does she have to do with it? How could she know? -From you. -Or from you? What's wrong? Are you following me? Go, I'll catch up with you. Hmm. What the fuck? Go ahead. I will not be long. What is it? Do not go with him. I did not ask you. Laima, I'm telling you again, do not go with him. Hey? Jonas, get out of here! Are you crazy? This is our business, you get out! I do not care about both of you. I'll talk to you later. Why are you doing it again? Get out! Bastard! Do not you dare approach me on the street again! Do you understand? Why? I ask, why?! You're the operative for the State! Lithuanians despise the man like you. Really? And whores, who are tagging along with officers are good? Them too. If you are not aware that it's revenge. Revenge?! I owe to have a revenge! Revenge on your policemen. that assisted German, and I will go after them, remember! I'll remember. No! One of you, go with me. Other two, stay at the entrance. Why him? Why? I looked at some papers here on your house So that you won't get any more tenants or thrown out ... ... and here all on that Vinces Tuchkus. To whom the Germans gave your house. And immediately comes in the question ... Why did they do that? For what deeds? Not for any particular. At that time, many Lithuanians got Jewish houses, he was hiding me during the occupation. You know. Hiding you? And why did he then run away? Because of fear. People are afraid to be sent to Siberia. What people? I'm here, I'm not afraid. Stop it. Innocent people are not exiled there. And now, because of the runaway father, they can also search for a daughter, the singer. They will wait a couple of days, and arrest her. What is her fault, Grigory Ivanovich? What if she is an accomplice. What do you want? Well, whom is it for? I'm asking you! For whom? I am pregnant! Do you understand? I'm going to the midwife for an abortion! I did not have enough money, so I took this. -Laima, you can not go home. Your father is wanted. -I know. Is that all? No one saw you? Well, no. Tell her not to scream. Neighbors will hear, inform on me. Understand, that ever since the ban on abortions was introduced. My husband and I risk getting a prison sentence for performing illegal abortions. Take off her shoes. And go for a walk for an hour. She will just need some rest ... She will be able to walk back on her own. That's all, go on. Pick her up in the evening. Go, go! And do not hang around the entrance, in front of our neighbors. Take a walk. You have a high fever. Can I call the doctor? Do not. And do not be shy in front of me. That is fine. Try to sleep, and do not worry about anything. The Major will try to remove you from the wanted list. He can not promise, of course, but ... ... he will try. So I'm hiding now. How you did in the past. Abortion ... That's over. Why do not you throw me out? You know. Marry me. You do not want to. Now you do not want to. I want to. I do. I won't not burden you. I only need your last name. Surname? Of course. My Jewish last name. Actually, I changed my mind. I changed my mind. Let's have a drink. Come on. Eh ... You don't have to raise your hands. The wedding continues. Grigory Ivanovich. Set his plates! Comrade Taratuta. And we are here. celebrating casually, and here you are! Well, it's an honor for us. It is such a gift to the young. Welcome. Please seat down. And what is this? Everyone left. Are you scared? You are like our father, Grigory Ivanovich. Sort of. Someone would like to see me in a coffin, and not at this wedding. Although. This someone ... ... owes me something. Oh, sure. I owe you a lot. I owe you for everything. For your "victory" over us. For the "bright Soviet future." It's a pity that only me, alone can walk into that future, without my mom and dad. How can I thank you? For all this is happiness. Uh? How? And I'll tell you how. Give me a kiss, sweetheart. And we'll be even with you. That's all! Enough! Leave, please. Nobody called you here, Grigory Ivanovich. Please, leave. I'll have a drink, I'll go. It did not break ... Bad sign. You will not be happy, lad. However, who has it, this happiness? -What is it? -I'll sleep here. -Why?! You know. Explain to me why not me? Why? Why others? Explain. Because they mean nothing to me. I do not care about them. And me? No! No! Please no! Only this will not change anything! Traitor. Max. Listen. You're a Soviet guy. We have been chasing those bandits in the villages. Now, it turns out that you - a Jew - are defending fascist bastards. How come? I did not see this life. I do not remember. I'm terribly sorry for everyone. I was afraid of them in my childhood. Black, bearded. As if unwashed. They looked like wizards. I used to think ... ... that they would steal me. And drink my blood. No one drank your blood, but their children's. Speak, bastard! Where's the Coalman ?! Speak! Well! Did you hide him? Did you feed him? What could I do? They came armed with guns and they took food! What could I do ?! Piece of dirt. Are you in touch with them? Are you? Answer me, filthy bastard! Nit. All set here. Three of them. Load them up. Do you know what my problem is? I came for revenge. For mother and sister, for all the dead. But it turned out ... Well, here it is, Coalman. He did not shoot the Jews. He hid me in the partisan detachment. He fought the Germans, and now I killed him. Error. His mistake. Since he decided so. They are ordinary Lithuanians. They are not gangsters, not policemen. Only they do not want the Soviet power. It's not for you, a Jew, to judge us, the Lithuanians. Consider I did not hear this. I'm leaving at all. I can not do this anymore. I can not. I do not want to shoot at them. Your choice. The Red Army liberated Lithuania and helped it to join the USSR. But the surviving accomplices of the fascists continue to treacherously shoot at the backs of the Soviet citizens. The Party is given an order to intensify the ruthless struggle against the bandits and nationalists ... ... with their families and accomplices. Operatives of our republic with the support of the troops of the Ministry of Internal Affairs ... ... smoke this evil from forest cellars and hide outs. They will be swept away from the Lithuanian land. And as the great Stalin said, "The enemy will be defeated, the victory will be ours, comradesâ! Here you are! Sit down, we will play. Sit down. Laima. Why did not you sleep at home? -I can not sleep well in your house. -Really? And where do you sleep well? Hook it. I think I am pregnant again. And it is not from you, again What? This is my child. This is my child! Do you understand? -Today I go to that woman. -Why? -Because I do not want to give birth to your child. -Why?! Why? Do you listen to the radio? No one likes you, cops. -No one. Why my child needs this? -You're just taking revenge on me! Right? You're just taking revenge on me! For what?! I need to see a chief. Did you come to resign? Yes? Well, that's better. We are looking into the case about the ghetto. And there it is. Look for yourself. Look, look. Do you recognize? This is your Vinces, Laima's father. He certainly is not a Coal Miner. But he served in the Zonder team. He was selling the personal belongings of the executed. I think he killed your mother by using this parabellum. In short, we then missed him then. Not us personally. Taratuta was not vigilant. He also let your Laima to escape the prison. Not only her. Do you see the marks? They are the family members, that Taratuta erased from the deportation lists. He broke the law saving them. Broke the law. The headquarters are aware of that and they require our evaluation. And here we come to the main problem ... This is your resignation letter. due to the disagreement with the authorities. Here is everything about Taratuta. Criminal pity for enemies. Unjustified losses in personnel. Alcoholism. Inappropriate actions towards women. Sexual advances In general, he will face a resignation and a prison term. You saw all this with your own eyes. Sign it. Otherwise, we all will be responsible for the shortcomings. I will not sign this. Then I won;t be able to help Laima. She is a daughter of a war criminal, and will be deported to Magadan. She will have to break the ice with the ax. Jonas, she's pregnant. So what? Women do give birth in the camps too. Sign it. Now everything is in your hands. Her life is in your hands, too. Sign it. This is not a denunciation. I guessed about it. He brought things. Dresses, rings. At first I did not want to believe. And then... I'm going to that woman ... -I have to take care of it before Magadan. - No one will touch you, they won't touch you. I did it ... I signed it ... -What? -No one will touch you. No. It is necessary to go, but I waited for you. Did you want to keep the child? Now I do not want to. -Well, hello. -Grigory Ivanovich? Hello. So this is your Leah? Dark eyes like yours. -Please forgive me, it is my fault. I betrayed you. -Stop it! Don't you understand where we live? They'd still bury me. They kicked me out despite all the medals. My wife left for Rostov, I stayed here. -How are you? Working in the restaurant? -No, they promised. I work part-time in different places. -I see. Well, let's go. We should have a drink. But I have ... Bring her back, and let's go. ... the struggle against the capitalist nationalists has not yet been completed. But our country has more insidious enemies. These are Jewish bourgeois nationalists ... ... secretly working for Western intelligence, they harm socialist society. They made their way to .... ... in art, in medicine .... -Finally. Your dad is coming. -The daughter ... Will you let me in? I'm sick. Came to see you. Maybe ... for the last time. I am not for a long time and I'll go back to the forest. Will you let me in? Moscow is quiet ... ... the nights are blue. The rays of the Kremlin rubies shine brighter ... The day passed, and it is night again. You must be tired ... My dear Muscovites. And I did not get to Berlin, son. I was wounded by a shell near Koenigsberg. Many of our people got killed there. Hundreds of thousands. The generals were pushing us forward like cannon fodder. -And they did the right thing. -Well, how so? -Because, son. Because war is always cannon fodder. -This is wrong! - Everything is wrong! And everything that happens to us, that's all wrong! - No, you're wrong. -You're wrong, son. =No. No. -I'm right! Right. No. You are not right. Oh, Motherland, you are judging me so harsh. Laima ? Laima went to work. and get some medicine. Put her down and leave. I'll leave, but first I will tell you something before. You know ... When I was young, I was selling a coal to one Jew and selling it. And I kept thinking. Why is he richer than me? What does he have? I this hands are better, or he is smarter? That's when the difficult hour come to Lithuania ... When the Russians came before the war. He, this Jew ... ... immediately took their side. Yes, all of you, began to serve the Muscovites. When they started to deport us to Siberia. You took their side! Of course, we have done a lot of wrong things, cooperating with Germans. But this was our payback to you, the traitors. And yet ... I was not trying to get into the Zonder- command. I was only delivering coal to them. And somehow it happened. But I did not shoot the women and children. And I did not burn the corpses I only took the coal to them. Do you understand? I only delivered the coal. Max. Laima. It's me. -Elsa, your neighbor. It's me. -Yes? Sorry, I am late, but the girl will have more chance to get a fresh air. - Uhm, well.. -Laima took her along with her. -Baby, really? Well, then I'll take the jars, the milk jars. I just need to return them, you know? In the dairy kitchen. They need the back. -I, sorry, I'm in a hurry, I have a job. -But, they won't give me milk. Moscow is quiet ... The nights are blue. The rays of the Kremlin rubies shine brighter. -Come on. -So. ... What can I tell you, Muscovites? At our parting. What ca you reward me with ... ... your attention? Goodbye... ... dear Muscovites. Goodnight. Good night to you! Remember us. Why did you let him in? And you would have thrown your own dad out? He has diabetes. The leg is rotting. He needs ampoules for injections. -Until I find them, he will not leave here. -Either he will leave, or I personally will drag him to Jonas. Well then, he will leave. Only I will go with him. And I will take the baby with me. Go to sleep, my little mouse. Go to sleep, my little goat. And grandfather will sing you a song now. About the old stupid coalman. Vinces Tuchkus, come out. Slowly with your hands up. Come on, come on. Clear this from the table. - I see, you want to leave. - What do you understand? -It is evident that God turned away from us when my father and I entered your damned house. -What?! What? My mother's house! This is the house of my little sister, who was dumped alive into a ditch and buried, you call it damned? Why? For what? The girl is alone. My daughter will return from work soon. Maybe we'll wait? We will see. You go ahead, pack your stuff. And my advice to you, take some warm clothing. Come on, come on! You're pretty well settled here. I'm came for you. Come with me. This is me, who let him in. And I hid him. I. I! Do not be stupid. She confessed in everything. But I'm sorry for you. Your girl. You were my partner. During the interrogations, I understood. Nobody recruited you. And Laima is not to blame. But she will have to answer. Understand. It's not me, it's not us who decides. Not us... We are only delivering the coal. What? What does it mean? Jonas, what needs to be done? I'll do everything. Just help me get Laima out of this. Do you hear? Help me get Laima out of this. Laima can not be saved. She will be deported as a father's accomplice, on the first train. Let him through! Did they hit you? There ... On the chest of drawers there is a recipe for Leah. Cough medicine. Laima, you are my Laima. I failed to take care of you again. I'll save you. I will do all in my power, and I will rescue you. I promise you. And I want to tell you ... If you love someone, do not think about me. Just think of our baby girl. That's all. Go on. Tell the girl about me. Let's go. And you know? It's not you who picked me then. I've chosen you! Do you understand? Close the cars! Laima, forgive me. Laima, forgive me! Where are you going?! Stop! This is for Coalman and for our Lithuanian guys! Did you miss the tune, Leah? Start from the beginning. Give your nose, here. " And when your mom comes back, you will play it for her. -Yes? -Yes. I do not want a hat, grandfather. Ah, my Motherland !!! Why you are so harsh to me?! You won't pity me and you won't forgive!
