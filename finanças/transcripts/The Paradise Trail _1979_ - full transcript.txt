(clock ticking) - [Dean] Train on time? - Far as I know. - Doggone it. (horse whinnies) Is that clock right? - [Tom] Far as I know. (footsteps approaching) - [Dan] Howdy. - Howdy. Supposed to be here at 4:40? - Far as I know. - Train on time? - Far as I know. - Doggone it. I'm waitin' to me my brother. - Why do you want the train to be late? - Huh? - Well you've been as nervous as a mountain lion's tail in a room full of rockin' chairs ever since you come in here. - Ya, well, I'm pickin' up a federal prisoner and takin' him to meet the hangman, and it's a long ride to Canyon City. - What are you afraid of? You got a gun, he don't. - I don't want the responsibility of him in my town waitin' 'til next week's train. - Who is he? - Morgan Cayhill. - Morgan Cayhill? He's comin' here? To my station? - Here, you need this more than I do. - Well, thank you. (horse whinnies) (slow western music) I wonder what on earth he's grinnin' for? - Well, ever since he was a little boy whenever he got his own way he'd grin just like that. He's my brother. (train whistle blows) (triangle ringing) - May I have your attention please? As you all know, Reverend Jim Taylor and his lovely wife Becky have brought us all here to celebrate the birthday of our lovely Indian princess, Skyla. (crowd cheering) And I'm told Becky made some of her famous oatmeal cookies. Ya, so we want you all to have a real good time tonight. Before we did into that barbecued beef though, the princess has requested a couple of songs, so go to it boys. ♫ Timber, timber, timber ♫ Oh the mountains high ♫ Down the canyons wide ♫ Let me roll and ride ♫ Ride through timber ♫ When the day is done ♫ 'Neath the campfire's gleam ♫ Let me lie and dream ♫ Dream of timber ♫ Tall timbers callin' ♫ And the echoes ring ♫ All nature sings a song along the timber trail ♫ Blue shadows fallin' ♫ And the canyons tell ♫ Of whispering pines and twines along the timber trail ♫ High in the sky above ♫ The love song of the trees ♫ Will wend and blend its way out on the breeze ♫ Tall timbers callin' ♫ And the echoes ring ♫ All nature sings a song along the timber trail ♫ High in the sky above ♫ The love song of the trees ♫ Will wend and blend its way out on the breeze ♫ Tall timbers callin' ♫ And the echoes ring ♫ All nature sings a song along the timber trail ♫ The timber trail ♫ Timber, timber, timber - Morgan Cayhill, he escaped from two federal marshals this afternoon. - Wait a minute. Where did you hear this? - Johnny Logan's grandfather seen him at the depot this afternoon. - What time? - Just before the 4:40 come in. (crowd chattering) (horse hooves clopping) (soft dramatic music) (moves into light western music) - And in Romans chapter five, verse 12 it says, "Wherefore as by one man, sin entered into the world "and death by sin, and so death passed upon all men "for they all have sinned." - So when Adam sinned, sin entered the human race? - Mm hmm. And where does that lead? - Remember verse 14. - Oh, I see, it speaks of Adam and of Christ who is yet to come. The difference between man's sin and God's forgiveness. - Excellent. Now remember, when we talk to folks about salvation we must always make it clear that Adam's sin brought the penalty of death upon all of us, while Christ's sacrifice on the cross took away that penalty, and gives a glorious life to all who receive Him. - I have a federal warrant here for a Dan Cayhill. He's wanted by the Bureau of Indian Affairs in Washington in regards to a missing person. They've sent a wire stating that we are to deliver him to the train depot in Cortez on Tuesday in time to meet the 5:10. Two federal agents will be on that train. - Who's got him in custody? - That's the problem, he's not in custody. - What do you mean? We're supposed to deliver a man in four days and we don't even know of his whereabouts? - We know he's in Fremont County. - Sheriff Dean Cade's territory. He can't even find the way back to the barn without his horse. - This Dan Cayhill, he wouldn't be any relation to Morgan Cayhill now, would he? - His brother. And I'm asking you men to get both of 'em to the train depot in Cortez on Tuesday afternoon. - Can't they give us more time? - Nope, because it's already started to snow in the high country and that 5:10 out of Cortez is the last one out 'til spring. (train whistle blows) (light western music) (train whistle blows) - Becky, I'm gonna feed the chickens. (metal clanks) Skyla? Becky? (gun cocks) (birds cawing) - It's alright. Nobody's gonna get hurt. Me and my brother, we just need a place to stay for a few days. - Where's your brother? - He's just making sure nobody saw us come down here. Anybody else here besides you two? - [Jim] Just my wife. - [Dan] You'd better not be lyin' mister. - He's a minister of the gospel, he does not lie. (horse hooves thundering) - Get these two inside quick. I'll put the horses in the barn. - [Dan] How much time we got? - Not enough time to stand here and jaw about it. - I'll watch around front. (intense dramatic music) - Jim, what's this? - We'll be alright Rebecca. - Now when they get here, Preacher, you get rid of 'em. (horse whinnies) - You get out on the porch and try to act natural. (slow dramatic western music) - [Dean] Preacher. - Well now, I suppose you boys rode out here to talk about joining the church? I realize when the Spirit is movin', you boys just don't want to wait. - Well, you just keep preachin' to the Indians. Those savages need a little religion. Right boy? - [Men] Amen. - What is it you want? - We're lookin' for the Cayhill brothers, Morgan and Dan. - Dan Cayhill? - You know him? - Ya, I know him. I haven't seen him sheriff. Wish I could say I had. - We thought maybe we'd look around. The barn maybe? - They're not in the barn. I was just there lookin' after the chickens. - Well, if the preacher says it's okay maybe we ought to just movin' along. Sorry to have bothered you. - Try to make it to church one of these days. - Ya. Ya, I'll do that. (horse hooves rumbling) - You done real good, Preach. Now come on in here. How 'bout that, Danny Boy? Preach done lied for us. Wasn't that nice? - He did not lie. He hasn't seen anyone in nearly ten years. He's blind. - Blind? Well you don't uh, look blind to me. (fingers snapping) Well now, why don't we just say a prayer and get the preacher healed? Glory hallelujah! - Stop it! I'll have no more of that, do you understand? - Why ma'am, I thought that was how it was done. I was only tryin' to help. - Leave him alone Morgan. - We've caused enough trouble here without you makin' more. We have to figure a plan. - Ah, don't worry about it Danny Boy. As long as we got these folks as insurance, we got us plenty of time. - Well when those federal marshals get on our trail, we haven't got a prayer. - Ya, you're right. Those guys could track a grasshopper across a thousand miles of hard rock. (hooves clopping) (train engine chugging) (crickets chirping) - What are you staring at? - Preacher ma'am. I was just wondering how he got blinded. - A man's gun went off and I got hit. - What did you do to get him back? Did you kill him? - No Mr. Cayhill, I did not kill him. Why should I? - Don't you hate him? - I don't hate anyone Mr. Cayhill, not even you for coming here and disrupting our home. - How's it feel not to see? - Mr. Cayhill, maybe it doesn't upset my husband that you don't have any manners, but I've had about enough of it. - Actually Mr. Cayhill, to answer your question, I've found that it helps me to be less hasty in judging people. - Oww! Ain't he a fancy talker? (laughs) - How we gonna work it tonight, Morgan? - Work what? - The watch. - The watch. Well you watch til, uh, two, and I'll take it to sun up. (crickets chirping) (slow soft music) - It's good for you that your brother did not find you sleeping. - Does he frighten you? - He has much evil in his heart. I do not think you are like him. - You ever hear of a man named Billy Coulter? - [Skyla] No. - Well I'm gonna kill him. Now do you think I'm like my brother? - Your words are not like arrows. It is not evil in your heart, it is deep pain. - Are you religious? - No, I'm not. I'm Christian though, and there is a big difference. - There is? - Being a Christian makes you alive. (laughs) In the holy book, Romans 6:11, Paul wrote that Christians are told to think of themselves as dead to sin and alive to God through Jesus Christ. - You'll have to explain that. - Well, you are alive on the outside, but on the inside where you hurt, you are just the opposite of what God wants you to be. - How did you get mixed up with the preacher? - My mother's parents were killed when she was very young. An Indian hunting party found her, took her in, and raised her. After she became a woman, she married my father, and when I was 12, soldiers raided our village, and my mother and father were ... - So, the Indians wouldn't have you back because you're a half-breed. - That is true, but the whites would not have me either. God knew of my troubled heart. He sent the preacher and Becky to me. They've given me a home and much love. - What is this? You're supposed to be listenin' for that posse, not this little squaw. - I better go inside now. Thank you Dan. - Woo wee, thank you. (laughs) - Shut up Morgan! We just talked, that's all. (laughing) - [Man] I don't know Big John, you got a lot more faith in this wild goose chase than I do. - [John] Aye laddie, you should always be rememberin', he who loses faith cannot lose anything else. (train engine chugging) (cards shuffling) - Say, you wanna play some po-- Nah, I reckon you wouldn't, being blind and all. You'd probably think it was a sin anyway. Ain't you at all nervous about your little squaw out there, all alone with my little brother? (water splashing) - Preacher. He really doesn't have any hard feelings toward the man who blinded him? - No. - Not even a little bit? - [Skyla] Not even a little bit. - That's mighty hard for me to swallow. - His love for Jesus Christ has given him the power to overcome hate. Jesus said in the holy book, in John chapter 10, verse 10, "I come that ye might have life, "and that ye might have it more abundant." - So you think that if I believe the way that you do, my hate will just go away. I just don't see how that could happen. - Well, it's like that water. It fills us up when we are thirsty, but after a while we get thirsty again. Jesus said in the holy book, "But the water I give them becomes a constant spring within them, watering them forever with eternal life." His water will heal the pain in your soul. I will be patient. God will reveal Himself to you because I believe you want your heart to be healed. - Morgan? You know you think you're a pretty tough man. Cocky, shrewd, arrogant. You got it all figured out. I was that way once. I guess I never realized how much I needed God, until one day I discovered He was all I had. - Preacher, I ain't the least bit interested in what you got to say about religion. So say your sermons for the church, will ya? (laughs) - You aware that my husband has to preach tomorrow? - Lady, he can preach all he wants, just so long as he ain't preachin' at me. - You mean, you'll allow us to go to town? - I didn't say that. The squaw and the preacher can go, just so as not to arouse any suspicion. You'll be home, sick. - Does anyone in town know you? - The sheriff and the old guy at the depot, why? - 'Cause you're going to church tomorrow morning, Danny Boy. Just to make sure the preacher don't bring home any lawmen for Sunday dinner. - All we, like sheep, have gone astray. We have turned, everyone, to his own way. And the Lord hath laid upon Him the iniquity of us all. Think of that. All our sins on Him. He became a willing sacrifice. The Lamb of God, perfect, without spot. The only one who could give his blood to cleanse you and me of our sin that we might have eternal life. Think of it. (Tom sneezes) He submitted Himself to crucifixion, the most torturous method of execution ever devised by man. Back at the beginning when Adam sinned, one man brought death to all who descended from him. So also by the sacrificial blood of the Lamb of God, one man, Jesus Christ, brings life eternal to all who receive Him. Is it possible to understand the magnitude and the greatness of that sacrifice? The total cost to God and his Son? To bring you and me and all who are willing out of death and into his glorious life. I doubt it. (intense dramatic music) - Young man, where's the sheriff? - (sighs) Beings it's Sunday he's probably fishin'. - Fishing. - [Man] What can I do for ya? - Well now, if you'd like to take on one of the Cayhill brothers all by yourself, that's alright with me, but I'd send for the sheriff if I was you. - Those guys are here? - Ya, in church. - In church? Is this some kind of joke? - No! One of 'em is sittin' there, right near the front. - Imagine Jesus in the garden, fully aware and fearful of the great, supernatural agony ahead, sweating drops of blood under the strain, realizing the betrayals ahead, but humbly and lovingly submitting to his Father's will. Imagine the trumped up trial of the Sanhedrin, being called a blasphemer by the most religious men of the time for telling the truth, the sorrow for seeing his trusted disciple Peter deny that he ever knew him. Think of the pain when the guards began to whip him and yank out his beard and spit in his face. Consider the irony of his trial before Pilate, when an angry crowd yelled madly for his crucifixion in exchange for the freedom of Barabbas, a known murderer. I can almost feel myself the shock and pain as the Roman soldiers stripped him of his clothes, pressed thorns into his skull, and mocked Him as king of the Jews. Then, unable in total exhaustion, to carry the heavy cross all the way up the hill to Calvary. There, nails tore through his flesh and into the wood. Splinters brushed past and into pus oozing wounds caused by the whips of the guards. I can almost feel the pain in his body as the big cross is lifted and the torturously dropped into the hole in the rock. (footsteps pounding) - Have you seen the sheriff? The Cayhills are in town. - The Cayhills? - You want to join the posse? - (laughs) Not me. - It has been said that the cross is particularly cruel because the body weight tears against the wounds of the nails. And at the same time, the outstretched arms pull agonizingly against the breathing muscles in the chest causing every breath to be a double-agony. So my friends, there He is, our Christ, tendons stretched to breaking, muscles knotted or torn with unrelieved spasms, fighting for each breath while his precious, life-giving blood drips from his wounds. Then, lifting up his head, He could say, with love that still overwhelms, "Father forgive them, for they know not what they do." The thief on the cross next to Jesus had also walked that same lonely trail. He was guilty, sin-ridden, without God, but he turned to the sinless, suffering Christ and asked to be remembered. Jesus at that very moment was bearing the burden of sin of that thief who deserved to die, and he followed Christ into paradise. Jesus wants you and me to meet Him at that same cross, to be cleansed and forgiven, and to rise with Him in the resurrection, into eternal life. (slow dramatic music) - This is all we could get? - Nobody wants to face those guys. - Well we're just gonna have to make due. - Isaiah 53:5 says, "He was wounded for our transgressions. "He was bruised for our iniquities. "The chastisement of our peace was upon Him, "and with his stripes we are healed." He gave us all He had, my friends. He could give no more than that. Imagine if you will, the man whose job it was to raise and lower the bridge so that ships could go under and trains go over. One day this man brought his little boy to work with him, and in his busyness, discovered that his little son had gotten tangled in the gears down below. A train was coming. The bridge was up. Would he rescue his little boy and let hundreds of passengers perish? Or would he lower the bridge to save those passengers and let his precious, little boy die? How many of you would've been willing to give your son or daughter? - I guess the best way is to go in there quietly and try and take 'em by surprise. Otherwise, they're liable to take hostages. - What do you want us to do? - Well, you and Ed get on that knoll in front of the church. John, you stay back of the church here. I'll go in with old Tom and see if he can point him out to me. - What are you gonna do? - Well, it's just about time that the preacher will be invitin' folks down to the altar. When they go down, I'll go with them. - Ya, and if they don't kill ya, you can get baptized next week. - To receive Him, you must believe that Jesus Christ is the living Son of God, that He was crucified, dead and buried, and in three days resurrected, and that He lives. You must be willing to admit that you have sinned, and that his precious blood has covered your transgression. Come. Give your hearts and lives to Jesus. Leave your sin at the foot of the cross. Give Him your burden. Whatever you are suffering now, He understands, He's been through it. If you're lonely, afraid, if you have something against your brother, if your life is empty, your burden too great, come, give it to Jesus. Come my friends. Come down to the front and give your life to Jesus. He gave his all. Give your life to him. - Nice try sheriff. Drop your gun and put your hands on your belt. (gun clamors on floor) You, come here. The rest of you people just pray that nobody does anything foolish. Sheriff, tell your men outside to drop their guns, and I mean no funny business. You get that preacher down here. Now! - Hold it boys, hold it! Bring your guns in to me, bring your guns in. It's all over. They've taken hostages. (footsteps clinking) (dramatic theatrical music) - Put them guns in that buckboard. You and the preacher get in there, too. You fellas get around there. Get to the back. Let's go. - Boys, get back to the office. Get guns and horses. (Dan whistles) - H'ya, h'ya. Morgan! Morgan, sheriff's on to us, we got to get outta here. - How much time we got? - Not enough to stand here and jaw about it. Let's move. (horse snorts) - [Morgan] Alright, alright, alright, easy. (sighs) We can't be stoppin' every few minutes for you ladies to rest, 'cause the posse don't rest. - Sure wish I could talk some sense into you boys. - Worried about our souls, Preach? - Yes, you might say I am. - Think me and Danny Boy are gonna end up in hell. Do ya, Preach? - That is a distinct possibility, Mr. Cayhill. The thought has crossed my mind. - You should've heard his sermon this morning, Morgan. It was very interesting. - Hey, maybe there's a chance for my little brother to get some religion here. You suppose? (laughs) Well now, I guess if that happened I'd have to go to hell all by myself. (laughs) - You think that's funny, Mr. Cayhill? - (laughs) Ya, ya I do. - Why? - Why? Because there ain't no hell, that's why. - Well for somebody who's never seen the inside of a church, you seem to know an awful lot about it, Morgan. - Believe it, Morgan. There is a hell. - How do you know? You ever been there? - I came mighty close, mighty close. Jesus believed in hell enough to give his life that we might escape it. Think about what might happen to a person who rejects heaven. - I suppose it would be unbearable to be in God's presence in a sinful state. - God allows us to choose our own destiny, Morgan. Romans 6:23 says, "The wages of sin is death, "but the gift of God is eternal life." - (laughs) H'owee! We got us a real honest to goodness revival meetin' a goin' here. Praise the Lord! (laughs) - Shut up, Morgan! If you'd listen once in a while instead of thinkin' you know it all, you might not be runnin' from the end of a rope right now. - Better watch it, little brother. I ain't gonna take too much more of your yap. - Now hold it men. I didn't mean to start something here, I just wanted you two to think about your future. (dramatic intense music) (horses snorting) (train whistle blowing) (water babbling) (gun clicks) - We're not the only ones here. (gun firing) - Hold it, Morgan. He's an old man. Besides, he's out of shells. - Come on outta here, you varmints. I'll shoot every last one of ya. (water splashing) You people got no business here, now move out! - Alright, calm down old man. - You got no business on my property. - Now just simmer down now before somebody gets hurt. We ain't here to steal from you. We just need a place to camp here for the night. - How do I know you ain't lyin'? - Now listen up here, you old sidewinder. If we was lyin', you'd be dead by now. So quit jawin', we're stayin'. - Ain't got anything worth stealin' anyway. I've got some kettles and the like if you ladies would like to do some cookin'. (fire crackling) (wind blowing) - I still think it's kinda stupid, Morgan, havin' this fire. - Danny Boy, you worry too much. Fire belongs to the old man. - You think those guys are just gonna come ridin' in here blowin' trumpets? - If we can't get to the mine shaft, we got us some insurance, Danny Boy. Don't worry. (kettle creaks) - Hey lady, didn't you forgot somebody? - I didn't think you needed any. - You thought he needed some. You thought the preacher needed some. Why wouldn't I need some? - [Becky] Your cup was half-full when I looked. - It looked half-empty to me. - [Jim] Leave her alone. - [Morgan] Maybe they ain't no better than I am. - Morgan, it's only coffee. - No, it's not only coffee! Every thing. All my life people have been treatin' me like I was a, a rattlesnake. It's the same thing here. - It's probably, Mr. Cayhill, because you been actin' like one. Fact is, I've seen a lot of rattlesnakes in my time that were a darn slight friendlier than you. (gun clicks) - Morgan, put it away. You stoopin' now to shootin' blind men? (intense music) - Mr. Cayhill. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you. - Don't be sorry for me lady. - Why do you hurt inside, Dan? - I had a wife once. Mary Jo was beautiful. We had a little girl, her name was Christy. She was 13 months old. She had long, beautiful, brown hair, and big brown eyes. One night we were eating dinner when the window behind me was shattered. Billy Coulter, the notorious bounty hunter, aimed a Winchester at the back of my head. Told me to come out and round up. - You did wrong? - He thought I was someone else. I was in jail for two nights before they got it cleared up. When I was in jail, some renegade Indians broke into our cabin. I never saw my little girl again. I wish I hadn't seen what they did to my ... (sighs) I rode back to town, insane with hate, determined to kill every Indian I saw from that day on, and to get Billy Coulter. (dramatic music) I drew on him. He fired first. Shot me in my leg. I fired back and missed. (soft dramatic music) - I understand why you have great sorrow in your heart, but your hate is wrong. - I suppose you love those who killed your mother and father? - I hated them, Dan. And that is natural when you hurt that deeply, but Jesus taught me to forgive them, to love those who've wronged me. - I'm not gonna forgive him, I'm gonna kill him. - Can't you see your hate will destroy you? - I owe this to my family. I have good reason to hate Billy Coulter. Can't you understand that? - Danny, when Jesus was on the cross, He had good reason to hate, but he prayed for those who put Him there. - My wife and baby were murdered. - God's Son was murdered. He knows just how you feel. And if you receive Christ in your heart, you will have the power to forgive, just as He did. - I can't do that for Coulter. Why should I? - Because Jesus showed us that when we forgive, even if it may not do anything for our enemy, it heals the hurt in our heart. Forgiveness is for us. - Why are you so interested in what happens to me? - No, the time is not now. There's not enough room in your heart for love. (train engine chugging) (wind blowing) May I get by? - What for? - I would like to take these to Mother Taylor. - You forgot to say please. - Please. - Purdy please? - Pretty please. - Now, that sounds real nice. With molasses on it? - Let the lady by, Morgan. - She forgot to say the right words, Danny Boy. - I said the right words, now let her by. - Pretty please with molasses on it. - There, now you see, all it took was the right words. That squaw is sure gonna get you in a heap a trouble one day, Danny Boy. - Thank you, Dan. - Can I talk to you for a few minutes? You know, I gave what you said last night a lot of thought. (soft music) But what good can come from a man being blind or a cripple? - I am not God. That is part of what faith is all about, trusting. It is good from his point of view. Dan, you're only looking on the outside. There's so much more. - But, I don't understand why you think Christ is so great. I mean, you're a half-breed. - I will show you. (soft music) (twigs cracking) (water babbling) - I thought ladies were scared of bugs? - (laughs) You forget, I am half Indian. Do you have matches? - You mean, you're not gonna rub two sticks together? - (laughs) I am half white. - Oh, I see. (match strikes) (soft music) - That is what Jesus Christ did for me. - What do you think, John? - It's a bit too obvious. - That's what I'm thinkin'. - Morgan's gettin' sloppy here. (footsteps clacking) (rattlesnake rattling) - Mr. Cayhill, there's a rattler in the shack. - A rattler? (soft intense music) - I would claim your promise this morning, Lord, in Romans, knowing that good will ultimately come from this experience. I know you're trying to reach out to Dan and Morgan with us, but You gotta help me, Lord, 'cause I feel that old tempter comin' back. - Say, Preach! Hey preacher, you know how to handle a gun? - Do I know how to handle a gun? - That's what I said. - Well now, even if I did, it wouldn't be me a whole lot of good, Mr. Cayhill. Why do you ask? - Well, I got to thinkin' that if you was all alone out here one day, and you came face to face with one of them buzzers, well, you wouldn't have no way to protect yourself. Would ya? Tell you what, just reach into my holster and take my gun. I'd hand it to ya, but I scalded my hand this mornin' helpin' your missus with the dish water. She got it all wrapped up with ointment and a rag. Go ahead. - I don't need your gun, Mr. Cayhill. Thank you anyway. - Take it. - Why all of the sudden, Mr. Cayhill, are you so interested in my well-being? - Well, I guess you're just rubbin' off on me, Preach. Seemed like the godly thing to do for thy brother. - Mr. Cayhill, just what is it you have up your sleeve? (rattlesnake rattling) - Well now, mister preacher man, too bad you don't see, 'cause there is one of them buzzers right now there in front of you. He don't look nearly as friendly as I am. - Why don't you shoot it? - Why I am surprised at you, Preach. I thought you was a godly man. Well even I can't kill one of God's creatures. (rattlesnake rattling) (intense dramatic music) Besides, you got my gun. Even if you gave it back, my injured hand, ya know? He's gonna strike, Preacher! (gun firing) (shotgun fires) - [Dan] Coulter, Billy Coulter! - [Morgan] Let me have this thing lady. I thought I'd seen him before. - [Skyla] What are you doing? - [Dan] Get away. - [Skyla] What did he do? - You little half-breed, you knew all along. Don't play games with me. - I don't know what you say. - I say this man hiding behind his pulpit with his fancy words is Billy Coulter. - Don't you think he's suffered enough? It was an accident. - Ya, it was an accident. (dramatic music) - [Skyla] Danny, please do not do this! - Shut up! The only way to handle this situation is the way the good preacher would do it. Don't it say somewhere in the good book about an eye for an eye? - Well now, my brother's really gettin' into this religion stuff, huh Preach? - Shut up Morgan. - I won't run, Dan. I'll face the situation right here. - [Dan] Okay, your wife for mine. (intense dramatic music) - Please, he's paid enough for his mistake. - [Jim] I'll be alright, Becky. - I'll give you a ten minute head start. - I don't know what your beef is, mister. Hardly seems like a fair fight. I mean, the man can't defend himself. - Neither could my wife and child. - I'll hang on to that, old man. You're too careless. (train whistle blowing) (water babbling) (rock bangs) (horse hooves clopping) (light western music) (gun clicks) - Let me have the gun boys. - I don't believe this. - Let the blood run you guys. Keep on shufflin'. - Would you be happen to havin' a couple of spare cups of coffee ma'am? - I'll look. - Where's your brother? - He's takin' up religion. He's been followin' in the preacher's footsteps, and when he finds him, he's gonna kill him. - Untie him. Would anyone like some cookies? - [Morgan] Cookies? - Now that'll be fine. - Just stick a few in my mouth, ma'am. - These are the best oatmeal cookies in all of Fremont County. (donkey braying) - Hey'a Morgan! I'll tell ya what laddie, if you'll be promisin' not to tell the sheriff you got the best of us, I'll be doin' me best to see if I can get you another cookie. (bird cawing) (horse hooves clopping) - That'll be far enough, Morgan. - [Sheriff] Where's the other one? - We'll be bringin' Dan in. You take these people back to Cortez. (slow intense music) - Hey, blind man. Preached your last sermon, you know that? You're a coward! You been hidin' in a church. You're a liar! Where's your God now, huh preacher? Where is He? - He's here, Dan. - You been lyin' for so long, you actually believe it. You hid your killin' behind a pulpit. Behind your blindness you hid your greed. - I was blind, Dan, before I lost my eyesight. Then God helped me to see. - You don't make sense. - Dan, ten years ago God used a young man full of hate and revenge to make me see my life through God's point of view. That's why I know He's here now, Dan Cayhill. Because the man He used to shoot away my eyesight was you. (dramatic music) That night in the street, I could've killed you, Dan. (gun fires) You fired as you went down. The bullet struck me, (intense dramatic music) and six months later I was blind. That's the way it was, Dan. - You knew who I was the day I rode into the ranch. Didn't ya? - Yes, Dan, I knew. I didn't have the courage or the faith to find you and tell you I'd forgiven you. That sermon I preached Sunday, Dan, that was for me. I could've saved you years of bitterness. I forgave you a long time ago, Dan. Now, I'm asking you to forgive me. You need it desperately. (gun cocks) (horse whinnies) (light happy music) (train engine chugging) (train whistle blows) - Hold it preacher! Don't move! (moves into intense dramatic music) (train whistle blowing) - There's nothin' to be done now laddie. (train engine chugging) (trestle rumbling) - Can you believe that? - Faith and someone was watchin' over those two. Come on laddie, let's move or we miss that train. - We'll make it. It's got two water stops in the mountains, people goin' in to Cortez. - Praise God. (Jim sighs) That took courage. That also took forgiveness. That is what happened, isn't it, Dan? - I don't know what's happening. - What's happening is you're beginning to realize that your hate is a sin that Christ took with Him to the cross. Let Him have all of it, Dan. That's what He died for. Don't quit on Him now, Dan. Jesus wants to forgive you. Don't hang on to it, Dan. It'll just keep eating away at your soul. - What about my family? - Let go. The Lord will handle that. It's so simple, Dan. Just like the thief on the cross, tell God you're sorry. Ask Him to remember you in his kingdom. (soft slow music) - [Dan] Oh God, I am sorry. Please forgive me. Please remember me in your kingdom. (clock ticking) - [Dean] Train on time? - Far as I know. (horse whinnies) (train whistle blowing) (train engine chugging) (bell ringing) (train engine puffing) (tracks rattling) - Good afternoon, gentlemen. - Is this Dan Cayhill? - It is. - What's this all about? I've done nothin' to the Indians. - Mr. Cayhill, I'd like you to meet a very special little girl. Her name is Chimita. - Hi Chimita. You're a beautiful little girl, you know that? (soft light music) Is she? - That's right, Dan. She's your little girl. - Christy? (soft uplifting music) Christy, I don't believe it. - Morgan? Morgan, listen. That night, two bitter men were stuck in darkness, and God used that hatred and greed to blind the preacher and bring us both closer to Himself. Morgan, why don't you give it a chance? - Guess I, I just don't fit. (laughs) See you in hell, Danny Boy. - Dan, I've got a federal warrant for your arrest, for aiding and abetting an escaped criminal. You understand you'll go to trial for that? - [John] Danny me boy, it's your word I'll be needin' that you won't be leavin' town before the filin'. - Don't worry marshal, I got two good reasons to stay. - Aboard!
