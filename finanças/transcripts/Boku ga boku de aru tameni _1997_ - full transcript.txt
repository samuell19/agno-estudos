Shizuoka. Winter, 1990. The runners of the last leg are here. That time, we were running with everything we had, we only knew how to just blindly run ahead towards the end, just keep on running. The high school where we were at didn't really get much attention... our studies and sports were so so, we weren't hated by girls but neither were we that sought after. Living in a hometown in the countryside surrounded by mountains and the sea, we were no different from ordinary high school students... I made it! But one thing makes us different... We are good runners. No, no, no! This way, this way! That idiot... Hurry up! Fallen to last place already! I can't run anymore. Now when I think of it, for all of us, that was the best time ever, like flying in the sky, with warm blood and sweat, that day, that time, we were definitely in the wind... He's coming. 2nd place, Numazu Minami. Numazu Minami? 2nd place? It's me, it's me! Here you go! What are you doing!? Go! Quick! 2nd place, Numazu Minami! Etsu, Etsu! Etsu, behind you, behind you! You can do it! Come here! Naru-chan! Good job! Where is he? Just a bit more, about 5 more minutes. Not him. There he is!! Go, go! He's running barefoot! Banzai! Banzai! Boku ga Boku de aru Tame ni (So I Can Be Myself) subtitles by yanie Tokyo. Winter, 1996. This "Merry Christmas" one, please. Thank you. So cold... I'm so sorry. It's okay. I'm very sorry. No... it's fine. Oh, no... Sorry. I'll take it to a dry cleaner and return it to you. It was my fault, after all. -But... -But... But? But, what... Miss? I've been waiting to meet someone as handsome as you are. She didn't say that. She didn't... She didn't, but well... I had no choice so I have her sweater with me. I think she said she work at a real estate agent. Oniichan, you look so happy! I'm not... I messed up the cake I just bought, and all... So? You got her number too? Her... number! You didn't? Student? No, I'm an office worker. Seriously? It's such a waste to be an office worker with such a pretty face, y'know. What do you want? This is my business card. How about a change of profession? You can definitely be a commercial star or a gravure idol. -Really? -I'm serious. Definitely. Excuse me. -Sorry, I'm in a hurry. -Don't throw away my card, okay? Call me! Hello. Kurosawa here. It's me, Ecchan! About tonight... Huh? Got cut off? That's weird... Hello! Riki? Sorry, the line got cut off. Yeah, I hung up. Stop calling me! I'm at work. If I don't keep calling, you won't come, will you? What's it about, anyway? Itâ€™s not a class reunion, why do you call everyone to meet up? Just come and you'll know why. Stop messing around, just tell me already! Fine, I'll tell you only. I'm... getting married! Are you surprised? Not really... but well, if that's the case... I'll come. Kurosawa Riki? Riki? -No. -Riki? What's wrong? You must be Kurosawa Riki. Can you come have a word with us? Hung up on me again... Mizoguchi. Who did you just talk to? I'm sorry. You can't get any business sitting here! Go outside and get business! Yes, Sir! I'm going now! There's 100,000 yen in this wallet. If I pretend and pass it to her saying, "Excuse me, this is yours..." Of course, there's no card or identity in the wallet. No one would know if she just accept it and keep quiet about it. Wanna bet? Ah, excuse me! You dropped this. Wow, there's about 100,000 yen here. It's yours, isn't it? Sorry, I looked. Uh... um... Just like you said. Heya, been a while! Kinoyan-senpai! A little early, huh. Gin Lime, please. I'm here to meet someone. Yeah, me too. Etsu called you too, right? I'm waiting for my girlfriend! -Girlfriend, y'know! -Girlfriend? I'm waiting for her. I don't know if she'll really show up, but I bring some extra underwear. What, Etsu didn't call you? He did call me, he did, he called me. Then when I told her, I'm meeting my seniors from high school, she said, "I want to meet them too!" So I said... Please come! I said, "Please come!" I don't mind. Naruse-san! What's with you? Wearing neck tie and all. Aren't you still a student? That's true... Oh, it's fine. Kinoyan, it's been a while, huh. Actually, I lied to my girlfriend! I beg you. Please lie for me, tonight! What? Arranged-marriage meeting? It's arranged by my father's business client... But.. we're... It's my parents' wish... I'm sorry. I don't have the confidence to go against their wish by myself. I can't be together with you as long as my parents against it. Etsu! -Over here! -Naru-chan! You guys came! -How are you guys? -Good. So? What did you want to speak to us about? Um, it's been a long time since we met, just wanted to get together and have a drink. Etsuro-san, please help me too! Actually... I'm a 24 year old elite office worker working in a big corporation, for today! What's this? That's what he told his girlfriend. So you have a girlfriend too, now. The little fellow who secretly went into the hills for plants & dragonflies... Satoru was such a weird boy. Didn't you go and catch a grasshopper once? Yeah, he ate it! Seriously, in which era were you born? Satoru is his granny's son, after all. Oh, right! You took notes on your chair during lessons, didn't you? He's good at that. Here's your beer. Whatever was just said, you can't say it in front of her! You mean, we have to lie too? I didn't mean to ask you to lie for me, but I'm asking you to be more elegant and flawless in front of Sonoko... I haven't even held her hand... Then you can't call her your girlfriend. I just don't feel like doing that when I'm with her. Maybe she's ugly. An ugly woman. So, she's ugly. She's here. Good evening. Good evening. Please, have a seat. I moved to Bologna and studied language there. Then, I went to painting restoration school in Florence. Even if it's the work by a great artist, the quality of canvas and paint will fade out as time passes by. Restoring those paintings neatly and reviving its beauty. That's my job. Recently, I'm working on the restoration of Vatican's Michelangelo. Is it weird? What I'm talking about? Not at all! I see... barikan(barber's clippers) huh. It's Vatican! Vatican-kyuujo(sport field), y'know. It's Vatican-kyuuden(palace). Kyuuden... So, what does everyone do? Oh... I'm a marathon runner. Marathon runner? I haven't ran in any special races... but I was quite well-known in my hometown. He didn't go to college and was directly accepted in Heart Sports. Heart Sports is a very big company. That's amazing. No, no. It's nothing. He works in a credit bank. I got the job through a friend's introduction. You don't have to say that. But, it's true. Kinoshita-san, how about you? I'm still a college student. He's going to be a pediatrician. So, you're going to be a doctor. Amazing. And I'm an elite office worker in a big company. You're all so great! But we're nothing compared to you... Who else is there? Other guys who force women they scouted to appear in adult videos. We don't force them! Those women want to get a job with good pay, so I only introduce them to an adult video director. And I don't get a single yen from doing that. But they give you what you want in place of money, huh. So you know it. You idiot! People like you are worthless scum in the society! How long will this take? Can't you, at least, serve me some rice bowl? That's hot. Who else is there? Where did you meet such a pretty lady like her? "Shall We Dance." It's a ballroom dancing studio. It's very popular now. I thought I had to keep up with the trend now, so... But you haven't even held her hand. I will tonight. I hold her hand, she hold me back, I'll become a man tonight. I'm sorry. I have to go now. I have to join an art collection party in Ginza. Is that so? It was fun. Sorry to disturb your meeting. See you later. Why did you do that? You shouldn't have gone after a woman by lying that you're an elite office worker. You don't get it. What? You have talent so everyone wants to get close to you. I don't think so. Unlike you, no one wants to talk to me, and I could only enter university where even idiots can go to. Why are you being so cynical? When I mention my university's name, they always say "Is there such a university?" No one would want to talk with me, then. You can't get a girlfriend because you think that way. Shall we go home? Riki is coming! He told me he'll come. You can't trust what he say. Let's go. Naru-chan. See you again. Wait a minute. Everyone's living in Tokyo, so let's meet up often, like before. We used to cut classes and get together, remember? And we'd talk to each other about our worries. Etsu, that was 6 years ago. Things can't be the same anymore. See you later. Bye! Ten o'clock already. Hello? Mariko? What are you doing tonight? 10 minutes 21 seconds. Naruse! You're 5 seconds late! Shimano-san? Coach. The ligament in his right leg is torn. I have to register for him. Shimano-san. Does it hurt? What are you doing here? You're acting nice but you're laughing at me, inside, aren't you? Get lost already!! Three months... It's over for him, then. Naruse, you have to take his place next year. Naruse! Wait a minute! Hey, wait up! I have your sweater! Your sweater! Hold on! Wait!! You got it. Go, go! Wait!! -Look at him. -It's me, it's me!! Wait!! Wait a minute! I have your sweater, but I forgot to ask your contact number that time... I'm sorry. That's a Christmas present, right? Yes, for my boyfriend. Boyfriend? Of course... for your boyfriend. Then, it must be such an important sweater for you. Ah, that's why you stopped the bus and got off. No... it was cause you ran with all your might... You were running after me with all your might, so... Sometimes I can't stop when I focus too much. It shocked you? No. I mean, I thought I'd never see you again. What now... Sorry about yesterday. It's fine. Your marriage! My deepest condolences. Just kidding! That's good news! What's wrong? Nothing. I'm glad you called. Cheers! Barefoot!? I was running barefoot before I knew it! I threw away the other shoe and just kept running. The next day, the local paper said, "Barefoot Runner! Naruse!" Sorry. I was the main headline. -Awesome. -Yeah? I became the legendary barefoot runner since then. That was long, long time ago, though. But you're still a runner now, right? Not just now, from here on in, too. That must be difficult. Difficult is good. It's different than when I was in high school. Now, the more difficult it becomes, the more I feel like I'm a part of the society. No matter how high the mountain, I have to think of some way to climb it, I have to slowly walk with my own legs. That's true. Sorry... That was actually what my mother said to me. When I was leaving for Tokyo, she said, "Hato-chan, Hato-chan, work hard, okay?" Hato-chan? Ah well... She always leave out the 'ya' in 'Hayato', it's my name. In the headlines on the legendary barefoot runner, they interviewed my mother so they called me Hato-chan too! Try this, this is good. Really? So you're living together with your girlfriend? Then, why don't you introduce her to me sometime? Nah, better not. Let's meet again! Huh? Okay. I'll introduce you to some women. I'm going this way. How's he doing? Naru-chan is doing fine. Really? He's practicing hard for the next race. You haven't been meeting him at all? Of course I haven't. He keep sweating, I gotta stay away from him. I dress like this, anyway. Bye. So, you're home. Remember I told you the present I bought you got stained on Christmas? I coincidentally met that guy today. What was it? Heart Sports? He works at Heart Sports. He's a marathon athlete. His name is... Naruse Hayato. Don't you think it's amazing for someone's talent to be acknowledged and he can join such a big company? Yeah, awesome. That means he can do nothing other than running, huh. You just got home and what is this stupid topic, are you talking to me about? Riki... I heard that you intentionally dropped that wallet, to see whether I'd accept it... and you made a bet on it. That's the worst thing to do. But you accepted it right? Thanks to you, I lost the bet. Take your money back. I handed it over to the administration office. Kawakami-san went around here and there, asking everyone if anyone have lost their wallet. This one? Kawakami-san? The 4th year female student who handed over the wallet to us. She does volunteer work at the welfare center. That's amazing for students nowadays. Please sign here when you finish. Okay. Keep your balance. No, once more. Come on. Keep your balance. Slowly. Alright. Keep it up! No, keep going, okay? Come on. What are you doing here? Nothing, just wondering what were you doing. It's volunteer work. You can see yourself. That boy... He lost his parents in an accident. It's been six months since I started this work and I think he's feeling much better now. His leg injury is healing. Just with a little bit more courage and comfort, I'm sure he can walk again soon. You know... You have a decayed tooth. Fourth from the right. What? Do you properly brush your teeth? You better take care of yourself before you worry about others. Bye. Oniichan! Are you her boyfriend? The lady in glasses. So she has such a cool boyfriend. No, we're just in the same university. So, you're gonna be a doctor too? Yeah, I guess. I wonder if I can run again. I won first place in a race last year. I wonder if I can get the first place again... Will you come and cheer me on? Yeah, sure. It's me, Ecchan! Let's meet up again with everyone. Sure, but why? I met Riki recently. And seems like he's concern about Naru-chan. He's not concern about him, he just can't stand him. Don't say that! Let's just meet up, anyway. Okay? Mizoguchi... I'm sorry! Aw, c'mon. I don't have much time here. Hello. This is Naruse. It's Satoru. What? It's you... Wow... "Hello. This is Naruse" you said! You must be expecting a call from a woman, huh. No... What do you want? Mochi Fest. Huh? Mochi Fest? You know... the annual event held by the track and field club. That Mochi Fest will be revived again after 6 years! What revival? What are you talking about? Yesterday, Kinoyan-senpai told me to contact you about this. I contact you and you should contact Riki-san. Why should I call Riki? I don't know his number. I'll tell you his number, write it down now. This is his mobile phone. But I have to go now. Can't you just call him? With a woman huh? It must be a date! I knew it! Actually I'm going for a date too, tonight. With the lady I introduced you, Sonoko-san! My secret flower garden, Sonoko-san! Something really good will happen tonight! Sonoko-san! I can't stand it anymore. He's not picking up. Too bad. Your phone just rang. Okay. I was thinking to pick it up, but... Just pick it up. What if it's a call from another woman? There's no way I have other women besides you. Of course, you have. Busted, huh. I'm going out, here you go. Sorry, to keep borrowing from you. Send my regards to that guy who work at the Heart Sports. I'm going just to get your sweater back. But you're all dressed up. No, I'm not. That's your favorite earrings. Such a waste if you just go back home. Why don't you go have dinner and drink with him? It's Saturday today, so he might ask you to stay over too. You're jealous. Yeah, so? I'll come back home as soon as I get the sweater. You're so cute being all serious! Alright then, thanks for this. Yeah, 20,000 is enough. Here you go. It's clean now. Sorry about it. Not at all. Thank you very much. Sorry that it became a late Christmas present. Okay, then. Send my regards to your boyfriend. Goodbye. Naruse-san! Shall we watch a movie together? It has a high class sweet fragrance. Just like you. Thank you. No, thank you. The classic concert was enough for me. You're going home now? My friend just came from Florence. She will stay over at my place, so... I'd love to stay over too. That's impossible. Don't clearly say it like that. I'm sorry, see you later! It's hard for me that I always have to wait for your call. You don't want to tell me where you live or your contact number. Can't we take our relationship... a bit further? Meet and talk is not enough for you? Not that it's not enough, but... I'm enjoying things the way it is now. I'm enjoying it too. Sorry, I have to go now. I'm sorry, bye. Sonoko-san... My home? Well... I'm living alone. There's no way I have other women besides you. Shall we? Then, let's get together tonight! Dad. It's your Dad. Why are you here? The door is unlocked. You shouldn't get in just because it's unlocked, this is not your house. Why are you here? By taxi. I'm asking, why are you here. By shinkansen. Not that. You're living together with a woman? Nice batting! Nice batting!! Like this? Focus on the ball! -You hit it! -I hit it! I did great? Awesome! The fig tree in our front yard, how's it doing? I'm asking you, how's the fig tree doing? Many people grew fig trees in their yards this year, but I heard fig trees brings illness. So I cut it down at once, but she's not getting any better. I guess it was just a myth. Who's not getting better? Your mother collapsed with a brain hemorrhage. Come home. Won't you come back home to Shizuoka? No more train. Shall we go home now? Let's watch a movie! Your boyfriend's waiting. You better go back home now. He's not my boyfriend. He's just a roommate. You're having a fight with him? We don't fight anymore lately. You have no problem, then. So it's going well, right? You better go back home. He must be worried. What's wrong? The more I realized the more I feel pain. We never fight, we never talk about how we are feeling, anymore. I feel so tired when I'm with him. Maybe... it's just not working anymore. I'm... ...sorry. What? Did you misunderstand something? I'm not awake because you didn't come home last night. Dad came all of the sudden. What is it called...? Prim and stiff? He's such a boring father. He started talking about the fig trees in the front yard and he kept talking about random stuff. I had the worst time ever last night. Where did you go!? Things would've been better with you around. Why did your father come? I have no idea... Why are you bad-mouthing your father? Why? Think of it. He plow the field everyday in Shizuoka. Today, the next day and the day after the next! He's not enjoying half of his life. Let me say it. He's the best bad example. Don't say that. Okay, then I ask you. If I'm that kinda man, will you still stay with me? -I... -I really hate that! Don't kid me. Working on his field everyday! I didn't mean to eavesdrop. I saw her outside... so I thought... Ecchan... How's your arranged-marriage meeting? Yes. I went. Ecchan, listen to me. I have work. Sorry. Hello! This is not enough! I'm sorry. Ecchan is here! A guest? You might have to close down your store. Please give us some time. We will definitely pay you the rest very soon. Please give us time! Your bicycle business might go bankrupt, you know. Don't say that, please. Fine, I'll take it, for today. Okay. We're sorry. You're here to collect money too? Don't bully this old man, okay? I'm sorry. Thank you. Sir... Who is he? A bill collector. I haven't paid him in full. Is it okay? You don't have to worry about that. Come on. Eat some. It's miso-mackerel! Looks good! Eat them all, just eat granny's share too. Who's granny? By the way, Ecchan. How about your marriage with your girlfriend? Is it going well? Well... that's... Her parents haven't approved it? If they don't like you, you can just elope with her. We'll do anything we can for you. We live for you, after all. We will always be on your side. Thank you for the food! What's wrong? Ecchan, what's wrong? Slow, quick, quick, slow. Sato-chan, you haven't been around for a while, I was so sad. -Seems like she's not coming. -Who? So, So, So... Sonoko-san. Oh, that lady! She's just one of them. Ladies who came influenced by the movie then immediately quit. I'm sure that Mrs. has quit too. Mrs!? Yes! Sonoko-san is married? Of course not. Can't be. Can't be, can't be, can't be. Mommy! Buy me the sweet potato! Are you really going to eat it? Yes! It can't be. You didn't eat it the other day. I'll eat it. Alright, I'll get my wallet, wait here. One potato, please. It's mochi, not potato. A guy asked me to give you this, Mommy. [Sonoko-san, the New Year Mochi Fest will be held on December 30 at 1 pm in the Kin'ou Temple. Please come! -Satoru] What am I doing?? Why did I invite her to the Mochi Fest? Shimano-san? Sorry about the other day. I yelled at you. How's your leg? Didn't you hear from the coach? They asked me to quit. I'll carry this for you. Thanks. I should've been more careful. I thought the company would take care of me when I can't run anymore. Got fired at this age... What now.. How about becoming a sports trainer? Nope, I can't. I didn't win any championship neither I break any record. Don't have such achievements. I continued running for this company and then they threw me away. Naruse. Don't become like me. Running for the sake of the company will only make you feel empty. Okay, 8 o'clock tonight. Yes? Alright. You want some coffee? Working today? A stupid client asked me to introduce him to some dark skinned gals. I'm thinking of getting back my old job. Your old job? That publishing company? As a contract employee, not permanent. But didn't you... I thought you didn't get along well with the chief editor so you quit. That's true, but I was young. I didn't do my work properly and yet I complained about the editor's work. I'd like to properly restart again from zero. Properly? What do you mean? No matter what kind, I want to do the job given to me with all might, once again. My dream is to be an editor. My dream is for the books that I'm in charge of, to be displayed in book stores. Is that what this magazine told you to do? You know, that kind of articles. "Make your dream come true." Nope, I guess not here. You're simple so you easily get influenced, huh. Oh, I know! The marathon runner who know nothing but running, influenced you, huh? Why won't you understand me? Riki, we can't keep going like this, we should... Should what? Do as you please. What were you thinking?? What? This! Why did you give Takahiro-kun money? So his name is Takahiro. He's fighting against his injury now! He's giving his all! You can't call this a good deed. You just did it on a whim! I think I'm still better than someone who pretend to be righteous like you. What do you mean!? I'm sorry if I offended you, but who would feel trouble when you're given money? I can't believe this. Why someone like you aiming to be a doctor? My father's a doctor, I can earn good money and I won't be affected by any economic downturn... I'm ashamed that I go to the same university as you are! This job involves people's precious lives! I don't think you suit this job! Who's Shimano-san? He's my senior. He injured his leg and got fired. So they'll throw away people whom they can't use anymore. The company doesn't need him anymore. What do you mean? If you see him as a normal employee, not as a runner, he's just simply an employee who can't work anymore. That goes for you too! What? When you can't run anymore, they'll throw you away too. You idiot, I'm working hard so they won't throw me away! With your sales work? No, with running. Huh? What do you mean 'huh?' !! You really don't get it, do you? Listen to me. If I win the race this time, it'll be a good promotion for the company. I'll be running carrying the company's name, you know. If I run with all might and contribute for the company, everything will be fine. That's the significance of Naruse Hayato's existence, huh. Existence, well... don't say difficult stuff like that. For the sake of the company... So you're running for the sake of the company. We're running out of beers here. Yako, get some more beer, will ya! So, didn't you come to talk about something? Nothing. Don't you think it's fun to have nabe together sometimes, like this? Kinoshita-san, you have a nice job. Doctors don't have to worry about getting fired. Yako. Rock, paper, scissors! I lost! Eh, you're going? Thanks. Hello! Sorry that I made a sudden call. I feel like drinking too. Welcome. Um, milk, please. -Very well. -Uh, hot milk. What happened? I'm fine now. What do you mean? I just wanted to hear your voice. I didn't expect you to show up. The hot milk is so late. Sorry if I rely on you too much. I mean... we just met... Me too. We just met and yet... I just can't ignore you. I care about you. Let me go! Look, if you stay with him, we'll get big money. He touched my breast. He touched you, because.. That means, Nana-chan, you have talent. Really? Really! Now, you better go back, and get that old guy's mood back. Really? Really. Now, c'mon. I'm very sorry! Her pride is high. When she's back, you may leave with her. Really? I'm serious. Then, you can do anything to her. She's quite big right? She's quite big. Sorry. See ya! I've been living together with him for 3 years and I keep worrying about him. I never think about myself. So, from now on, I want to start thinking about myself. I see. Thanks! See ya. Oh, right. We have a Mochi Fest tomorrow, won't you come? Mochi Fest? Can I come? Sure! I'll introduce you to my friends. Good night. Thank you so much. May good things... happen... next year too! Be careful! May good things... happen... next year too! Wait, wait. Ecchan, two more! Okay! May good things... happen... next year too! So late... Kinoyan-senpai said he's gonna be late. Not him... Sonoko-san will definitely come! Sonoko-san will definitely come! I believe that! Oh... okay. So you invited your girlfriend to come over too, huh. "You.. too.."?? Moo, moo, you're not a cow. Well... she's not a girlfriend... He's so late... You invited someone too? Riki! You called him, right? Oh, no... He's not picking up. Come on, talk to him. He said he always bring his mobile phone. Well, he might not bring it this time, he's not picking up. Hello? Hello... is this Kurosawa-san's phone? Yes, it is. Oh, um... Please tell him this is his friend from high school. My name is Naruse Hayato. Hello? Actually, we're having a Mochi Fest today. Can you please tell him to call Kinoshita's mobile? Yes, yes, thank you. That made me nervous! A girl picked up! He told me he's living together with his girlfriend. Is that so. You're still here? Your friend asked you to call Kinoshita-san's mobile phone. He said your friends from high school are meeting up. Alright. You picked it up? You're moving out, but you actually still care about me, don't you? I'll pick up the rest of my things in another day. I've asked the movers to come when you're not here. Sorry. You know, you keep saying I won't understand you, but... You don't understand me either, do you? That might be true. I know nothing about you. I don't know what you did in the past, what you came to Tokyo for... I came to Tokyo for you. I'm serious! I want to know your real feelings. Why are you running away? You always do that. You always do that in work too. You always make fun of your clients and the models and laugh at them. You always run away and never face them! You underestimated your father too. But how about yourself? Is this really the life you've always wanted!? Wait. Don't go. Stay with me. Riki... You're gonna get together with that marathon runner and then what? Now, come on... Let's start all over again. Sorry... See you later! Thank you. Ecchan... Nothing. See ya! Be careful. I lost my parents in an accident. I have a big sister but she got married and moved to Kagoshima. That old couple is like my parents, for me. They've done so much for me. What are you guys doing?? These are Kinoyan and Riki's shares! Fine. Sorry I'm late! Kinoyan! It was hard to find a shop that sell this. Here you go! Thanks! Let's do fireworks together later. Oh yeah, Riki called me. He said he'll come. Really? That's good. We're all gonna be here tonight. Welcome. What would you like to order? Gin lime. What's wrong with these two? They're feeling down cause their girlfriends didn't come. You idiot, it's not me... Satoru, how long are you gonna fret like that? I'm an ugly duck whom no one wants to get close to, after all. That's not true! Sato-chan, you're tall, you play music instruments, and you're handsome too! Compared to you, of course. You should be more manly about it! Loving someone is not something shameful! You should be more aggressive! Look who's talking. We're Mizoguchi. I am Mizoguchi Etsuro's father. We're very sorry to come all of the sudden. Our daughter told us his parents died. Please, listen to me. Etsuro-kun treat us, strangers, very kindly and friendly. He is a very kind young man. He... he... He want to be together with your daughter. He really, truly love her. If he can't be happy... I can't accept that. Here. We made this together with him. May good things happen to you next year too. We made this mochi together with Etsuro-kun. Please accept this! Please. Please. Please understand that he's a very good man. He's a very, very good man. Please understand him! Please! Please understand! It's been a while! Don't make a girl pick up your phone. So you were the one who called me? Naru-chan missed you, Riki! Don't lie. What would you like to order? Beer. So, you're living together with her? What? That's a nice sweater. This? It's a late Christmas present from my girlfriend. I envy you! What should I do to be able to get girls like you? Your choice is out of your league. -He's dating an older woman. -Seriously? -She's awesome! -But he hasn't touched her yet. -She made me feel pain down here. -She did? -Totally. -Satoru, good women are... those who let you do it when you want to... Go for it! What's wrong, Naru-chan? No... nothing. I heard about you. You're still running now? Amazing. I can't believe it. Really. Riki, you were offered a similar job too, right? But it must be tough to keep running with a company's name on your back. That's against my aesthetic sense. So your aesthetic sense includes making a woman cry? What do you mean? Well, I was thinking maybe you made the woman you live together with, cried. Yeah, I made her cry in bed, every night. You dreamed to be a professional runner too, didn't you? You quit cause I kept going? What? You were offered the job but you didn't take it. You hate running behind me, huh. What's wrong with you? Are you misunderstanding something? You talk like you carry your company's name alone. Well, of course, your company's name is written on your back. I know that. But to think of it from a different angle, that makes you a running advertisement, huh. No matter how much you carry the name, when you get injured or something, they'll fire you. I'd hate that, so I quit. Did I say something wrong? Stop! We're not here to fight! Those two just can't get along. Back then, Riki would have been the one who got all the attention if Naruse hadn't shown up. They have the same level of skill, but Naruse was the captain and the ace of our team, so he got all the good reputation. In other words, for Riki, Naruse is like an eyesore. But, they're friends. Back then, we were friends aiming for the same goal together. Don't you feel hungry? Let's have some ramen! Excuse me. Two ramen, please. What was in the past, doesn't mean anything anymore now. At least, for me... That's not true! You're working hard aiming to be a doctor too, right? You mean donating money is what you call working hard? My parents donated money to that university. I'm not aiming to be a doctor. It all just started with money. No matter how hard I try, it'll end up a lie. It has nothing to do with money! What's important is how you work hard for it! Grow up! Here you go. Thanks. Etsu... You better be a bit more mature... Okay? Thank you. We forgot about the fireworks. Sorry I couldn't come yesterday. What happened to your lip? Why didn't you move out earlier? If you don't like being with him, you should've move out earlier. I... have something to talk... Yako... my little sister went back to our hometown this morning. Won't you come to my place today? See? We're always on your side. We'd do anything for you, Ecchan. It's no big deal. We bowed like this, saying, "Please! Please!" I'm sure they'll understand you now. Right? You've gotta be kidding me. What's good about that? That's not good at all. Why did you do that!? Ecchan... It has nothing to do with you!! Absolutely nothing!! Ecchan! You're total strangers! Don't interfere my private matters! Ecchan! What?? Ecchan! I know that sometimes you can't take a step forward. Because you're a very kind boy. That's why my husband did it for you. It made me look miserable. I looked miserable!! We're sorry, Ecchan! I have... I have my own pride. Just leave me alone! I know that sometimes you can't take a step forward. Because you're a very kind boy. What are you doing!? I don't have the confidence to go against their wish by myself. I will always be on your side, Ecchan. Excuse me. Do you know the bicycle shop in the shopping street nearby? Yeah, the shop run by an old couple. They lack of funding and they're in trouble now. They're our trusted client and they made us their main bank for their business. May I request a surety bond for them to the surety company? What? Now? Yes! I want to make them happy. I'll show them that I can be firm and strong too. Impossible. You won't make it in time. I'll make it! Um... You know that I lied to you? Yes. I don't mind if you hate me now. I'm just a normal housewife married to a man who comes home late and a mother to a six-year-old. I wake up in the early morning and I make lunchboxes, see my husband off to work and then I drop my daughter in the kindergarten. Then, I wash clothes, clean around the house and watch TV. The day is over before I knew it. I've never been to Florence. And Vatican was a joke! The neighbors never call my name. They call me 'Yukiko-chan's mother'. I wanted someone to call my name. Sonoko-san... Meeting you reminded me of how I used to feel when I was single... I had fun. No, I'm... Lying to make myself look good, is the worst thing to do... Good bye! It's a bit messy... I didn't know, that Riki and you are friends... He's not a friend. It's over with him, right? I don't mind at all. I'm fine. Please, come in. You'll catch a cold. Coming in. Sure. You know what. I will run for you. Not for the company, but for you. Etsu! Why are you here? I just came from that pachiko place. Totally didn't make it, though. You came all the way here for pachinko? I came to a nearby pachinko, then I lost the money to eat some New Year soba. That's because you don't properly work! Get some work! You have work? Why don't we go for a meal now? I can't! The bank is closing! What are you mad for? -I'm not mad! -You're mad. I'm seriously working now, so my voice become loud. Wait, wait. What!? Don't get all tensed up. Just relax. So what, if you seriously work? I'm busy now. Bye! What's wrong with him? Thank you for the food. I'll get more ready for tomorrow morning. You don't have to. Ecchan! Sorry to call you here. The old man, the bicycle shop owner, came to your house, right? Sorry about that. It's fine. My father was angry, but... When I just start working in the bank and my boss told me to go outside, the old man helped me get a commuter pass. They're my first client. I see. No one would listen to me. They were the only ones who'd listened. They're very kind to me. I can see they really care about you. I will properly propose to you after new year. They encouraged me for it. I will bow myself in front of your parents. What took you so long? Thank you. Grandpa! Granny! It's Mizoguchi here! Not home? Here, use this. This is for you. And about Hiroko-chan... (To Etsuro) Ecchan, thank you for everything. The Mochi Fest was fun! Good bye. Grandpa! Grandpa!! Alright, alright. Hello. It's ... me. What's the matter? Can we meet now? What is this, all of a sudden? Etsu, I'll call you again, sorry, bye. Naru-chan. I'm going home. Stay over. Stay over for tonight. What are you in a hurry for? Since you know that it was Riki, somehow you become more... I mean, Riki... Riki what? What did he say? You spent time together with him during high school, right? That was in the past. The first time I heard from you... I envied you. I didn't do anything back in school. So I envy you to have such friends. It has nothing to do with it. I don't think it's right. What? To run for me... What do you mean!? I'm not happy with that! Today, it's not me, you're looking at. You're looking at... Riki, the man behind me... That's what I feel. Wait a minute! Riki is not in the past yet, for me. It's not over yet. I'm sorry. -What's going on? -They committed suicide! -The old couple!? -Yes. I heard they had trouble with their business. Even so, they shouldn't have killed themselves. Well, they don't have any children. Maybe they were thinking about their life from now on and became anxious. Riki-san! He got hit on the head and lost consciousness. Then? He's in surgery now. He might need blood transfusion. I'll give him my blood or anything that can save him. He'll be saved! I believe that! Naruse-san! How's Etsu? He's in a critical condition. You just said he'll be saved! -I didn't say that. -He will be saved! I believe he will. Please, be quiet. This is a hospital. We're very sorry. There's nothing else we can do... What do you mean with that? Hey! You can take my blood. He need transfusion, right? Doc!! Right? I'll give him my blood. Save him. Stop it. -Doc. -Riki. -Save him. -Riki. Doctor!! Save him!! Riki!! Save Etsuro!! Stop that, Riki! Etsuro-san!! His sister is on his way here. Funeral service operating on New Year's eve is limited... So I guess he has to spend the whole day here. Is that so. It's New Year already, huh. Yeah. Still... What a new year we have. Etsu. I'm so sorry, Etsu. I'm sorry. Etsu... Etsu! I'm so sorry... I'm so sorry... Etsu... Look at this! They made me bring this much! They said I have to make you eat these. No matter what. Mom is always the happiest one to see you running. You have to get going for training. If you slack off like this, they'll get rid of you, like Shimano-san! What do... What do I run for? What do I... What do I have to run for? [May this year be a good year for you, Naru-chan! -Mizoguchi Etsuro-] The race is near but seem like Naruse-san is taking leave. I called his home and his sister is really worried about him. Yeah, so? Won't you talk to him? There's no way he listen to me. I'm not good enough for him. I'm not good enough. I can't just move out from here... and go there that easily. Then... Then you don't have to leave this place. Riki, why are you stopping me? Cause I love you. If it's not Naruse-san, will you stop me too? Liar! You just want to win over him! -You just don't want to lose! -I got it already! What are you doing here? I brought you a gift. Nice to meet you. But... I'm leaving... Excuse me. Broke up? I brought you a gift too. What's this? It's a small mat. Use this when you eat ramen. Why are you giving me this? Your mother made this for you. The left part of her body is paralyzed, so she weaved this for you with one hand. It took a couple of days. She want you to have this. Your mother said, you don't have to come back. Children have their own lives to lead. That's what she said. I came, just to tell you that. [May this year be a good year for you, Riki! -Mizoguchi Etsuro-] Dad! Dad, wait up! Tell her... Tell her thanks for this. And... I'll go back home when I'm in the mood. Just like you said, I might have been working on the field everyday without enjoying half of this life. -That's... -It's fine. I do have that prim and stiff side, but... your mother told me when she was on bed in the hospital, that she's lucky she has me. She is half-paralyzed and yet, she told me she's lucky she married me. I don't want someone like you, who can't make a woman happy, be a part of our family. You don't have to come back. Don't come home ever again! Naruse-san. I still haven't find a job. What are you doing now? Nothing. Just gazing at the sky everyday. How sad. Heya! -Oolong tea. -I'll have beer. -Where's Kinoyan? -Not here yet. Nice to meet you. I've heard a lot about everyone from Etsuro-san. I'd really like to meet everyone, so I asked Kinoshita-san's help. She has a favor to ask. Etsuro-san's sister sent me this as a keep-sake of him. It was the shoes he wore when he ran together with us. He had been keeping it. Together with the gold medal everyone received that time and the picture you took together. Did you bring a pen? Yes. I'm thinking of visiting Shizuoka. I want to visit Etsuro-san's and his parents' grave. This shoes was given to me, but... I think it's best to place it on the grave where Etsuro-san is asleep. She want us to sign on it. Shall I? Ah, yes. Etsuro-san always look so happy when he talk about his high school stories. Kinoyan runs while grasping the situation around and he always keep a cool head. You're going to be a pediatrician, right? He'd appear to be cold in the outside but he's actually very kind, and understand people's feelings. Kinoyan will definitely be a good doctor. That's what he said. Sato-chan would get too excited and took the wrong course sometimes. He's great the way he is but he always look down on himself. He's worried about you like you're his own little brother. Riki-san, you managed to catch up 4 runners in front of you during the race, right? When he received the sash from you, he was so nervous and he felt himself trembling. But you told him, "Naruse is waiting for you," "Go!" and you pushed his back. Etsuro-san seem to be very proud of it. That he could hand over the sash he got from Riki-san to Naruse-san. I ran in between of the two of them. I'm the one who connected Riki and Naruse. Awesome. You know, I quit my job lately. I still dress like this, though. I have a lot of free time. And I don't know why, but his face keep showing up. You know, actually, I met him right before the accident. He scolded me badly that time. "You have to get a job!" He was really mad at me. Here you go! Hot! Got off. Then, I'm thinking, the last time I saw him, he was working so hard, he looked very cool. But, well... The last time he saw me, I was doing nothing... Just wandering aimlessly. How awful. How pathetic. -Your friends? -Yes. My precious friends. We had to go through hard training. I felt like giving up a few times. But since I was doing it together with them, I was convinced that I could run till the end. Oh, right. Takahiro-kun, I have something for you. Here you go. Let's run together someday. Take your time. Let's work hard together. Takahiro-kun! I'm leaving. Potato, potato. Potato is here. A warm, baked potato. Delicious, baked potato. -Excuse me. -Welcome, welcome! Sorry. I lied to you! What are you doing? I'm not an elite office worker! I'm Otsu Satoru, a college student and I go to a university where idiots go to! I'm Otsu Satoru! It was your fault, that you got fooled! You're an idiot too! What are you doing? Stop it. I'll buy all of your baked potatoes later! Really? But I was serious about you! Even if you're just an ordinary housewife, I fell in love with you! What's so bad about being a housewife? What do you have to be ashamed of? You work hard to make your child a lunch box, you clean the house, wash the clothes, wait for your husband to come home late, that's an awesome way of living your life! People's value does not depend on what they do for a living! What important is, how you live your life! That's true! Yes! I came just to say good bye! I don't hate you at all! Banzai for housewives!! Banzai! Banzai! Banzai! Goodbye, my love! Thank you! Hey, hey, wait a minute. Here. Wait! Goodbye. Thank you. What are you doing here? When we're down there the field felt so big, but if I look from up here, it looks so small. You know. That girl, the one wearing a white jersey, she's cute. Pretty. Cute. Take care of Natsumi, okay? Take her out for a meal sometimes. What are you talking about? I'm going back to Shizuoka. Well, I don't think she'll forget me that easily, but why don't you just try and woo her? What are you going to do in Shizuoka? Growing oranges... taking over my father's job. My mother fell ill and my father is working alone, if I don't go back to help them, Etsu will definitely scold me again. Yeah. He would cause he lost his parents. If I go back there, he will have a place to come home to. I heard you're skipping training lately? Natsumi is worried. She don't have to worry about anything. Cause I have talent. I can catch up in no time. You have talent? Aren't you just trying to work hard all by yourself? You have never given your all for something, that's why you keep making fun of the others. I'm not making fun of you! -You just won't admit that I'm good. -Of course. Who would do that? You had all the attention from the public that time, because we ran together with you. Satoru ran, Kinoyan ran, I ran. Then, Etsu saved you. That's how the barefoot runner legend was born. The gold medal you got that time, was not only yours. Prove it. That you can run by yourself without us, in the next race... Not just any race, but that one. When I see you all sweating and catching your breath, on the TV screen... That's when... I will admit Naruse Hayato is the legendary runner. Riki... You have to be number one, too. I don't have any interest to be number one. Not to mention, being number one in growing orange is not cool at all. So you'll be back to the countryside and plow the field, huh. That's a really cool job, though. It'll look more cool if I'm the one who do it. Don't grow rotten oranges, okay? You don't have to tell me that. I'll make you eat the rotten ones. Work hard, okay? I will. You don't have to tell me that. So many things are happening, I forgot to say this. HAPPY NEW YEAR! He's inside. I know. I came just to bring him some food. And yet, you wear your favorite earrings. These were from you. Yeah. Riki. Even if Naruse-san was the reason, I was happy that you stopped me from leaving. Cause... I loved you. Me too. I might have not changed if it wasn't you. I'll be more serious. Thank you. What's with the change of heart? Just so you know, if you decided this on a whim, it'll end soon. Then, watch me. If you think I shouldn't be doing a job that involves people's lives, I want you to look out for me. Why me? Cause you have the things I don't have. If that's okay with you. Wait a minute. Um... I've been going to the dentist. I'm getting treatment for my decayed tooth. Really? I use contact lens now. You're prettier when you smile. Niichan! Thanks for the shoes! I'll do my best. I'll do my best to get the first place! Alright! I'm not here for travel. Please, let me work here! Our recruitment period is over. I know. But please consider me. Yeah, but... My name is Otsu Satoru, 22 years old. I'll work really hard! Please consider! Maybe you can work part-time. Sonoko-san. Yes! Sonoko-san? Can you help him find a part-time job? Oniichan! Heyy, you came!! Yeah, I came all the way for you. Don't say it like it's trouble for you. Just wait for about 2 hours and 10 minutes! I'll get the first place. Reallyyy? See ya! That time, we were running with everything we had, we only knew how to just blindly run ahead towards the end, just keep on running. With warm blood and sweat, that day, that time, we were definitely in the wind. And now, we are running different paths, to meet again in the greatest moment.
