(sighs) (cabinet doors thud) (sighs) (plastic rustles) (coughs) Don't worry. I've got your dinner, too. Gotta keep you big and strong, Rufus. So we can beat this thing. (can clinks) Jordan for two.

(coughs) (coughs) (somber music) (wire clicks) (wire creaks) (switches click) (glass clinks) Let's see if I'm getting any better. (sighs) (coughs) (sighs) (bag unzips) Day 13. No changes. The virus looks as if it's still attached to the host blood cells. The high GMHG antibodies seem to have no effect after one week. I will try the next vaccine given to me by Dr. Rhodes. At this point, I'm conducting blind testing. Rufus is still alive. That's all.

(phone bleeps) - [Machine] Mailbox full. (phone clacks) (suspenseful music) (coughs) Hello, Gabriel. Come on with me. (coughs) You're gonna stand over here, Gabriel. Watch over me. (chuckles) (coughs) (chuckles) That's better. You look cool. (chuckles) You feel cool? (chuckles) Well... What do you wanna do? Wanna see somethin' gross? Pretty gross, huh? I got 'em all over and it's only getting worse. (sighs) In the meantime, I keep sticking myself with these needles, hoping something helps. It's a long-shot. (chuckles) Don't worry, I have a feeling you can't catch it. Never really noticed how nice of a place we picked, huh, Rufus? It's not as nice as when we were with Dr. Rhodes, but, it's not bad. Oh, Gabriel. This is Rufus. He's sick, too. So what do you think, Gabriel? Do you think someone's gonna find a cure? I know. It's embarrassing, huh, Rufus? It's bad enough when I'm talking to you, but, now I'm even asking a mannequin questions. (coughs) (somber music) (coughs harshly) (sighs) (coughs) (coughs) (sighs) Let's give you a try.

(needle hisses) (device bleeps) - [Woman] Positive for ADS. - [Man] Take him to quarantine six with the others. - [Tim] I can't go there. - [Man] Will someone please put a gag and restraints on him? - I can't leave my family.

(locker door closes) (coughs) (cabinet doors close) (somber orchestral music) (plastic rustles) (food crunches) (breathes deeply) We need some tunes, don't we? Last week I found a station that was playing the Beach Boys. Could really use some Kokomo right now. (radio crackles) You ever been there? (chuckles) Don't answer that. It's a trick question. It doesn't exist. (sighs) I still remember the first time Katie heard that song. She came home from school and she asked if we could go there. I told her it was just a place they made up. She didn't care. So I took her to Jamaica instead. Next best thing. I still remember when she got on that beach. She said, "Daddy, can we stay here forever?" (chuckles) (sighs) Looking back now, it's probably... Probably the smart thing. Although, who knows? It's probably all over the world by now.

Where'd you come from? Huh? You gave me a scare. Yeah. (coughs) - Come here, Rusty! I said, come! Yeah! Yeah, you best listen better next time, you stupid dog! (dog whines) - Yeah, that is one stupid dog. - Hey, Otis. Why don't you, uh, go in the kitchen and see if there ain't no food? You got that? Anybody in here? (Tim sighs) You best come on out now. Don't worry, we won't bite. (Otis laughs) - [Otis] I bite! (chuckles) (Cutter chuckles) (gun cocks) - You find any food? - Nope. Ain't no food in here. Some milk, though, and it's good. This must be some kind of animal hospital or somethin'. - Yeah. I don't know what this place is, but it ain't no hospital. Hey, you checked that room yet, right there? - Woo! (laughs) Lookey there. Found some cash! - And what the hell you gonna do with that? - Buy things. - What're you expectin' to buy right now? Huh? Nevermind. Let's keep movin'. (suspenseful music) (Tim gulps) - Hey, Cutter? You'll wanna see this. - What you got? - A mother lode! Whole bunch of food and supplies. - Huh. Good work, cousin. I knew there was a reason I brought you. (dog barks) Let's get movin'. I think Rusty's onto somethin'. (lid slams) (suspenseful music) (Tim sighs) (Tim sighs) (suspenseful music) (Tim screams) (tape tears) (somber orchestral music) (tape tears) (tape tears) (somber music) (Tim coughs) (Tim coughs) (guns clunks) (gun clip clicks) (Tim coughs) (Tim coughs) - Hey. It's okay. I'm not gonna hurt you. Are you sick? It's okay, it's okay. (melancholy music) Just hold on. I'm gonna help you. Oh, man. Okay, just hold on. (needle clacks) (plastic rustles) Okay. You should be okay now. Just hold on if you can. You're safe. (chair scrapes) (liquid drips) (somber music) It's okay. This is gonna help you. (Kimberly coughs) I'm not here to harm you, okay? Don't worry. I wanna help. Okay, let's keep this in here a little bit longer. Just relax. You passed out in here and I gave you some medicine. Are you all by yourself? Oh. Hey, what's your name? No, (chuckles) I assure you I'm not a bad guy. I know you've seen a lot of crazy stuff out there, but, you're safe in here. - Is this zone six? - No. No, I promise you it's not. (Kimberly coughs) You wanna go to zone six? - Yes. I'm supposed to go there. - Who told you that? - My brother. (sighs) He said if we got split up to head straight to zone six. They're helping people like us. (sighs) (coughs) He's probably already there, waiting for me. (coughs) I think I should go. (coughs) - You need to stay here and rest a little. Besides, you're burning up. You won't get very far this way. (coughs) - You have it, too? (Tim sighs) - I do. (sighs) - I see. It killed my parents. - Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. What's your name? - Kimberly. - Well, Kimberly, I'm Tim. (Kimberly coughs) - Do you have a family? - No. No, I don't. - Well, I need to find my brother. We're all each other has left. - Well, Kimberly, before you go, I think you should know what's going on in zone six. - Did they find a cure? - Well, no. I don't know. I don't think so. I'm sure they're working really hard over there. And I'm sure your brother's fine in the meantime. I just think that... I think you should stay here. Until they do. See, the doctors... The doctors are working really, really hard, but they just don't have protocols for these kind of things. - Do you believe in God? - Yes. Yes, I do. - I do, too. (somber music) (Tim sighs) - Put some stuff in there for you. There's also some dried food. They're ready to eat. They're a little stale, but they're still good. - Thanks. What did you give me? Do you have any more just in case? - That was a... That was a little adrenaline. To give your body a boost and... No, that was the last of it. I don't have any more. (sighs) Are you sure you don't wanna stay? - Thank you, Tim. - All right. I'll walk you to the door. (lock clacks) (coughs) Well, Kimberly, I hope you find what you're looking for. Stay safe. (lock clacks) (coughs) (eerie music) (birds tweet) (ladders clack) (distant engine roars) (distant dog barks) - [Agent] You got her? (distant grunts and chatter) - [Tim] (sighs) Damn it. (trunk door slams) (sighs) (coughs) (sighs) Hey, Gabriel. Listen to this. "And in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God." (chuckles) That's you, man. But you don't look any angel I ever heard of. "Remember those who are imprisoned, as though in prison with them." Hm. They call the zones in which they take the sick "medical quarantines". But we all know what they are. They're a prison. A concentration camp. They gather everyone up and segregate them from society. They're not trying to help the people. They're just gathering them up so they can slowly die. I won't go there. I'll keep running if I have to. I won't give up. I promised my little girl that I would do something to help them with this sickness. And no matter what, I won't break that promise. (sighs) I always hated this game. Sarah... My wife. Always said it requires a lot of patience. What it requires right now is another person. (sighs) I hate being alone. Ironic, huh? Considering the situation. (sighs) You know what part I miss most about being home? It's the actual coming-home part. Katie would run up to me and jump in my arms and tell me about her day. Was so excited. Could be the simplest thing. When she made a... (chuckles) Turkey out of her hand. It was so revolutionary and exciting. (coughs) It made me feel the same. You really start to take that for granted. I would be at school all day, sometimes till, sometimes till 10 PM. Lecturing in front of a class, reading out of a book. Or just talking about on-campus improvements with the staff. (sighs) (coughs) Well, the problem with that is we spend our whole life doing what we had to and when it's time to do what we want, we may not get that chance. (coughs) (sighs) And if I could go back, I would tell Katie to live life the way she wanted. Do things that made her happy. To pursue her dreams. (sighs) Make every day count. Because you don't know... Because you don't know when that's gonna be the last. (chess piece clinks) - Check. - Check? Where? ("Moonlight Sonata") - Right there. (Tim chuckles) - Nice. Well done. - Hm. What kind of a car do you have? - What do you know about cars? - Well, before everyone left, all the talk was about what kind of car you drove and what it said about you. - Hm. A white BMW M3 convertible. - Ever drive with the top down? - Sometimes. What does that say about me? - Golf clubs in the back? - (chuckles) No. No time for golf. - But the weekends? - Oh. (sighs) Saturdays we worked all day in the lab. Sundays. That was always family day. What does that say about me? - Well... White suggests you have taste and elegance. (Tim chuckles) White is also associated with honesty, purity, or it could be that you live in a desert climate and white doesn't absorb heat the way black would and you don't want a car that's gonna bake you like a human pop tart. (Tim chuckles) However... White can be hard to keep clean. It's a high-maintenance color, perfect for high-maintenance people. Hope you didn't park it under a tree. All that sap. Really be hard on the car, you know? - It's parked at the university with 20 other BMWs. (coughs) - Hm. So... You gonna find a cure, or, sit here and die? - You know what? (chess piece clinks) I am gonna find a cure. I'm gonna do it for all those people out there. People like Kimberly. This can't be their last day. I won't let this be their last day. I won't give up. I promised Katie. (wristwatch alarm bleeps) Who gave you that watch? - Monica did. She thought it'd be funny to dress me in Mr. Morg's clothes for the next morning when he came in as a practical joke. But then no one ever came back. Checkmate. Who gave you that watch? (melancholy music) - Sarah did. - Wake up, sleepy head. (Tim groans) I've got a surprise for you. - A surprise? (sighs) I like surprises. - Hi! (Tim moans) - Hey, beautiful. What you got there? - Breakfast in bed. - What about your no food in bed rule? - Well, I'm breaking it. (Tim moans) - You want something. - No! No! (scoffs) It is a very special day! And... - There's an and. (Tim moans) - And I love you, Professor Timothy Andrew Reynolds. - And I love you, but our anniversary isn't until tomorrow. - Oh, I know, but I couldn't wait. Open it. (Tim sighs) - I think you should wait. It's only right. - Oh. Please? Please. Please. Pretty please. Please, will you open it for me? Please? - All right. - Yeah! (laughs) (paper rustles and tears) - Oh, wow. Sarah, this... Wow, this... It's perfect. - So you like it? - I... I love it. - Oh, good. - Almost as much as I love you. - Aww, let me see it. - Hey, how'd you pay for it? - Oh, I always find a way for the man I love. (giggles) - Hm. If we could only find a way to pay for Katie's braces. Those things are gonna send us to the poor house. - You are the smartest and most resourceful man I know. It's why I love you. You'll find a way. (both chuckle) (Tim coughs) - You're coming with me. (paper rustles) (paper rustles) (coughs) (marker squeaks) (coughs) (marker squeaks) (marker squeaks) (coughs) (marker squeaks) (marker squeaks) (glass clinks) (sighs) (sighs) (glass clinks) Come on. Come on. (suspenseful music) (sighs) Why won't it hold? (sighs) I don't understand. Maybe Dr. Rhodes was right. Maybe the cells are just too weak to fight back. (sighs) They need some kind of boost. (sighs) Wait a second. (pants) (objects clatter) (coughs) (objects clatter) (pants) (coughs) (pants) (coughs) (coughs) (grunts) (coughs) Please let this give what it needs to fight and hold. Please. (hissing) You are an angel. Come on, Rufus. I may have found the cure, but I need you. Let's go. (suspenseful music) (sighs) Come on, Rufus. Just hang on just a little bit longer. We need to try this. (melancholy orchestral music) (needle hisses) (somber music) (coughs) You know what I want for Christmas, Santa? To be able to get to the lab tomorrow, without being seen. That would be nice. I may have found a cure, Mister St. Nick. (coughs) But I gotta get more. So I can try it on myself. (coughs) I'm just so tired. Merry Christmas, Tim. (warm ethereal music) (coughs harshly) (somber music) (coughs harshly) (coughs harshly) (coughs) (melancholy music) It worked. (brooding orchestral music) (breathes heavily) (sobs) Daddy did it.
