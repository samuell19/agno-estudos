Produced by KM Culture Presented by KM Culture and Showbox Mediaplex BASED ON A TRUE STORY Winter Olympics 1996, Muju City Bidding for Winter Olympics HA Jung-woo Muju's Dream Gone SUNG Dong-il KIM Ji-suk KIM Dong-wook Written and Directed by KIM Yong-Hwa TAKE OFF June 1997 We have Korean adoptees with us today. They're looking for their families. They're from overseas. From America... ...Canada, France, the Netherlands... Please welcome CHA Heon-tae from America. Mr. CHA? Please. It's Okay, I'll handle it. My Korean name is CHA Heon-tae. I was born in Jeonju in 1971. In 1977 when I was 7... ...my sister and I were adopted to an American family. Whatever you remember, please tell us. Mom often fed us tomatoes sprinkled with sugar. She was left-handed. Oh, the apartment. She said she'd work hard and make enough money... ...to buy an apartment for us. And that she'd bring us back from America. Temporary, she said. She said it was only temporary. And it's been 20 years. Your sister married an American? Yes, they have a daughter. So adorable. I bet. She's your niece, and... Yes... How do you speak Korean so well? I didn't wanna lose it for my mom. So I took Korean at a Korean school. And I went to a Korean church. Watching the Seoul Olympics on TV, I saw many apartments. So I thought it wouldn't be long... ...before she'd come for us. They're your step parents? She seems precious. - Absolutely. - Right. My step mom can't get pregnant. That's why they adopted me. I didn't say pregnant. I said precious. "A precious lady." The heart in mind of your parents, not pregnant. I meant she had a good heart. I'm sorry, but... You're here again. A national team? I told you. I wish I could tear Korea apart. Korea sold me and my sister for 30 grand. Playing for a country that dumped us? That's funny. You can use Korea for your own sake. FUCKING KOREA! Hey, Bob! You might be putting her in trouble. Stop and talk to me. That's bullshit. She's my birth mother. What if she didn't want you? Not that she couldn't find you? It's very possible that she didn't want you. My thumb! You don't know her. Stop dissing her. I'm not! I'm just being honest. Most adoptees that come back turned out well. They're doctors, CPAs, and international lawyers. What about you? You're nothing but a loser! Why don't you put yourself in her shoes? I wouldn't want you if I were her. You have to let her find you. You'll get me interviews? Don't worry. You'll do more than celebs. Be famous, and she will show up. They were alpine skiers like you in high school. One of them got dismissed after they failed a dope test. - Dismissed? - Yes, off the books. What do you want these scumbags for? Scumbags? Watch your mouth. Who do you think you are, calling them scumbags? Put your foot down! Are you sure we're not lost? Of course. Just go back to sleep. What the... Get out of the way! Do I know him? Give me a ride. Move it, asshole! I can't believe this. Move, punk! Give me a ride. Move! Is he crazy or what? Move! What the fuck! Just give him a ride. Why should I? He's freaking crazy! What the... It's dead? You son of a bitch! You saw that? Laughing? I'll fucking kill you. You... Get back here! Stop right there! Get out of here. Come on, back up! I don't know how, asshole! What a nubjob. Fire! It's spraying! I told you to give him a ride! Come on, come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Does he work here? Bob, wait here. Hey, Deina. How's mom? Is she eating? What are the doctors say? Okay. Let me talk to mom. Hey Hey mom. I'm sorry I can't be there right now. Is Deina there everyday? Okay. How's the food? I miss your cooking. Yeah, I'm doing fine. Don't worry. Damn, your English is good. You look like shit though. Listen, Yankee. Lots of hot chicks at our club. I'll hook you up with them. Damn. You're funny. Come here. Give me your best shot. Go ahead. What are you doing? Look at this. We're a family now. - A family? - That's right. What a couple of morons. So you've been looking after your grand kids. Isn't it hard to put eyes on the dolls? This can't be easy even for young people. You're the only... Who are you? Heung-cheol, you still sniff glue? Come on, man. That was in high school. I'm clean now. Don't hang out with Lowlifes like them. Okay? Stop wasting your time and go to the military. Make sure they pay. Okay. That old man is a pain. What? Come on, drinking is a way to break the ice. Yeah, smiling is good. Is it agrichemicals from earlier? Why am I so drunk? Who is he? He's my brother. Don't you wanna be on the national team? Stop bothering us. I'm not buying it. I'm talking about the national team. We can't ski now. Thanks to that asshole. We couldn't even go to college. But we have to go to the military. It's fucked up. Fuck! You're a junkie. I only took cold medicine. Luminal... Fuck you. But you took over 100 pills. Fucking idiot. Stupid. Eat this. Funny. Come on, cut it out. Please! June 1997 Construction of Muju Ski Jump Tower That's ski jumping. You go down an in run, a ramp of 38 degrees. Which is 120 meters long. Then you take off, flying over 120 meters. Scoring is very simple. You get points for balanced style in the air. In addition to the length that you jump. Isn't it cool? And the distance points. You land at the calculation line at 120 meters. For every meter over, you get... 1.8 points, right? Yes, 1.8 it is. And 1.8 is deducted for every meter less. Since the wind influences the game heavily... ...the world records mean nothing. For a team competition, 4 skiers do 2 runs each. All the points are added to decide the winner. Right? What men wouldn't like this sport? It's cool enough to make your jaws drop. They fall and roll over... That doesn't happen often. Let me assure you. Most of the time, they fly with style... They don't always fall like that! You hardly get hurt even when you fall. Not every winter sport is safe. Importantly, no points if you fall. You should land well. Right? It happens now and then. We're almost done. You skipped school? It's out for the summer. Let me introduce the captain for our team. He was on the US junior alpine ski team. Only briefly though. Name's CHA Heon-tae. American one is... - Bob... James? - Yes, I'm James Hi. Hi. You are a fucking joke. Why us? Cause nobody wants to do it. What makes you think we do? So you can stop being scumbags. I told you so... What's in it for us? If you win at the Winter Olympics... ...you'll receive a cash reward. If you win a gold medal, they'll give you an apartment. Know what I'm saying? Cut me in, will you? Forget it. What are our chances to win at the Olympics? Zero. America invests a lot into it. And it's still hard. I'm out of here. Wish you luck, guys. Now we have 30% chance with the junkie gone. How old are you? TWENTY SEVEN! He's older than the junkie. He's 27. Don't expect me to call you Bro. Don't. We never do in America. Stop it! Fight! Fight! Calm down! Heung-cheol! It can waive your military duty. Too late for that. We've received a draft notice. Tear it up. Making the national team, it's postponed automatically. If you win at the Olympics, you'll be exempt. Exempt. Exempt completely. Daddy? How'd you know I was here? I'll wait outside. Heung-cheol? Ski jump my ass. I've already sold my skis. No way! You just disappeared. Did you think I couldn't find you? And you told the bank that they can arrest me? I've done enough for you. Seoul plate? It's $ 320 with the toll. You took a cab from Seoul? Get my stuff out of the trunk. What the heck are these? They're jade mats. Move them inside, will you? Your boys are coming. Crazy bitch... Crazy bitch... I made the national team. You heard me? Grandma, look at me. I made the national team. If I do well, no military. And you don't have to do this anymore. Okay? Ski what? Ski jumping. What the hell is ski jumping? It's cool, Dad. And I'm on the national team. How can a loser like you represent the nation? You can't even represent your own life. Damn the national team. You just do what I say. Understood? Understood? You useless piece of shit. Hey. You're cute. Here's a jade mat for you. It does wonders for guys. It's too much for a gift. I'm selling it. Not buying it. Looking for your mom? So scary. Guess how long it took me to track down my dad. I don't give a shit! 3 days. It took me 3 days. Let me know if you need help. Then buy this for me. Hey, come on in. They didn't see me. The national team! The national team! Come here! I don't know if I can do this. I bet you can. The coach's girl is a fox. She seems slutty. I'm not attracted to tramps. Is that why you banged that hag? I told you she and I were of the same age. Just watch. I'll screw her within 3 weeks. $50? Make it $100! You think you can find your mother? How do I know what would happen? Take them off, asshole. How do you feel about making the national team? I love Korea so much. People are kind. People are kind... Warm-hearted by nature. I can't wait to find my birth mom. You can't wait to find your birth mom... - Look, Mister. - Yes? You're from the Flea Market, right? What's taking so long? It's been an hour. Flea Market? I don't know if you saw but I fell off the bike earlier. But don't consider it a bad omen. Until that jump tower is completed... ...we'll focus on basics and physical training. Fine. Go sit down. That's what we're doing. I'm sure you have many questions. Concerning the gear and uniforms. Yes, Jae-bok? I have to go check on the restaurant. Sure, go. - Thanks, Coach. - Just go. Coach? What? We need 5 jumpers including a reserve. So? There are only 4 of us. We do need a reserve. A good point. I was wondering when you'd ask me that. I've deliberated a lot on the issue. Hey, come here. You can eat that later. Come here. stop... stop! Can you ski? Everybody in Muju can. You know why Japanese guys are great ski jumpers? They're small, but skis are big So the wind carries them longer. That's right. Perfect. So perfect. He's in middle school. There's no age limit. Let's get you in shape. He's only a reserve. I won't let him jump. If you were me, would you let him? What? Guys. You can't hang out here. This is a national team in training. You see that? Let's get out of here. It's only 30 meters long. Pick one each. Think of it as physical training. It's up to you. It's either this or running the track. If you can't do this, you can't do 120 meters. Yes, Jae-bok? - We have a group of customers. - Fine, go. Serve the group. Why'd you even come back? Let him go. - Just go. - I'll be back. No, don't come back. Where are you going? Get me down! Jump! Stop the car! Hang on! We're doing 90! Look! Hey! Flume Ride Fire! Hey! That Yankee asshole. What's on his shoulder? A birth mark? He's cool. You'd better watch him. Shut your hole, bitch. Hey, a lady of secrets. Wanna know my secrets? Sure. Then buy a jade mat from me. Or don't talk to me. What a loser! That bitch... Trying to sell me things? She asked you to buy a jade mat, too? Did I say 3 weeks? Make that 4. Move. Do we have to go to the pool or what? Bong-gu, is the water out? You're a genius I gotta hand it to you. One, two, three. Why isn't this working? When do we get to practice on an actual ramp? Chil-gu. You got a water pump? No. We can't practice without water? No way. You'll get scratched up. Hey! Why are you up there? Look at me! Bong-gu, wait! What are you doing there? Hey! Bong-gu! Get down here! What are you doing? Bong-gu! Fire! - Bong-gu! - Bong-gu! Jump. Fuck... Let me see. He's all scratched up. - You stupid fuck! - Don't hit him. Stop it. Bob? You have guests from Adoptees Association. Our efforts paid off. We've found your birth mother. But there's a problem. Let go! Why doesn't she want to meet him? Why avoid her own son? Are you drunk? Drink and cry... You're believable. Bob, trust me. I'll find her for you. I'm not doing this because you bought the mat. He bought what? Mind your own business. Yes, Daddy. It took me 3 days to find him. With this, 3 days are enough. And we won't stop trying until we find her. Don't worry. Shut up and stop drinking. Can't you see? She must be happy with a new family. Look, she dumped you for her own sake. If I were her, I would avoid you, too. Hey, stop! No fighting in the car! Scientific training? Fuck it. Hey! Wait! A documentary? It's a school project. A documentary on adoptees. I didn't know you were going to school. He's an adoptee. And he's an interpreter. Hello. Sorry. Here's her name and SSN. Fine. I can't give you any information without her consent. We need to contact her and see if she wants to meet you. What are you doing? Is that it? Is this enough? Yes. We don't need you. I'll talk to him in English. NO. Understand? What the fuck is wrong with Korea? I just don't get the shit. How can a government prevent a kid from finding his mother. This place is fucked up. I never do choice. What? He still wants to meet her. He said more than that. Are you sure you're an interpreter? - You are... - Cut! Why? What are you doing? He's supposed to be crying now. You ruined the scene. Isn't this a documentary? Don't you know me? I never do anything without a careful planning. I can't believe I have to act for a documentary. What do you want me to do? Let's do it one more time. Detective? Don't do the lines. So awkward. Come on, - I'm trying... - Look ahead. You take over, officer. Action. Well... I can't give you any information without her consent. We need to contact her and see if she wants to meet you. So... - Who is it? - I... I... - Sister? - Yes. We're spreading God's words. Our parish made this. It's been made with love of Jesus. Yes, I can feel his love. It's jade dust. You got married again? What? Let's pray. Dear, Lord. Thanks for watching us. We thank you for showing your miracle on this family. She's willing to share your glory... ...by buying this mat made in your holy name. Please, bless her family. - Amen. - Amen. Look. You really want to know? It's been 3 years since I got remarried. You have a son, right? Only a daughter. What's this all about? It's nothing. Buy more for other people in your family. We can give you a discount. I don't haggle over God's products. I'll buy them all. Hallelujah! Look! What's wrong with you? I told you not to wash this. Can't you read English? Don't wash. Please dry. I'm sorry. I don't read English. I thought it was washable. Study English, or quit! Get out of here! Hye-ra, we have guests with God's words. Don't mind her. Bring us tea, please. Go ahead. You washed this, too. Study English! That rude shithead. Fine, let that bastard go. For all I care! Coach, it's better this way. That Yankee made us waste our time. I'm so upset. Chil-gu? Your brother is taking his place. I've decided. That Bob asshole is quitting. You take his place. No age limit, right? That's right. Steady. Put me down now. Put me down. Sorry, dad... No, son. It's fine... Is it really enough? If you need more all you have to do is ask. Look, you're over there looking for your birth mother the one that left us for good. Whatever... fine! But just to let you know the mother that raised you out of your fuckin diaper is here in the hospital! Do you hear me? And now you call us and ask for money? And why is that? To pay for that woman's rent? Are you out of your mind? Just leave us alone. Don't call us here ever again! Don't come in until you find the receipt. Better yet, just leave. Oh, that's right. You have nowhere to go. Hi. That lump is the size of a golf ball. It's Bob! This is Bob. Welcome back! Bob. Bob. Bob. You guarantee an apartment? Me? If we win a medal? Yes, the gold medal. You're going for the gold? Yes. You think this is a B&B? What's a B&B? What's wrong with you? He's going for the gold. What the... Have you even changed your nationality? Being an American citizen, you can't play for Korea. Have you been naturalized, or what? What's 'Naturalized'? See me after practice. What are you doing? Just to let you know, I've learned Taekwondo. I was a boxer before I started skiing. I don't blink when taking punches. Stop bluffing, asshole. You haven't seen my kicks yet. Don't hit me in the ear. It's ringing. It doesn't stop ringing. Fuck! Su-yeon will never like a loser like you. Think about it. Fuck you! You're just using us. To find your freaking birth mom! Are you on vacation here? You think this is a joke? We're doing this for our fucking lives! Now I can see why your mom doesn't want you, Yankee. What do you Know? What the fuck do you know? You are just fucking crazy drug addict, a piece of shit! Yeah, you're right. She doesn't even remember my fuckin face! And that's exactly why I'm gonna find her! Because she's not coming for me... So do not get in my fuckin way! Because if you do I'll fuckin kill you! Got it? I don't understand a word. Fucking asshole! I'll kill you! Give it to me, baby. It's about time. I'll just give you $100. Jae-bok, that bitch... It's just... Promise me one thing. It's so hard. Just tell me you like me Then I will wait. Let's just do it then. Heung-cheol? Tell me. You think I sell jade mats for money? I'll sell them all for you. And I'll help you stop drinking. It's to pay hospital bills. I knew it. What is it? Liver cirrhosis? Or leukemia? AIDS. Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.

PyeongChang is bidding for the next one. Sir, I was nothing teaching little kids. And you picked me as a coach for the national team. I'll never forget that. But those boys... One joined, hoping to find his birth mother. And one joined to look after a retarded brother and a grandma. I tricked them into joining the team. If they can't make it to the Olympics... ...they will hate me until I die. And I will hate you until I die. No matter what it takes... ...I'll curse you for life. Sir... Please, don't break the team.

I see. Guys, I've been thinking... Don't call me Bob anymore. Okay, Heon-tae. I like your name. And show me respect. I was a boxer. You didn't tell them? You show ME some respect. I'm your coach. Gather up, guys. One, two, three... Let's go! Once done with a safety check on your gear... ...please proceed to the jump tower. CHA Heon-tae! Crush them. Sure, Coach. He lands! He jumps! He's down! It's amazing! He jumps! He's like a missile! He lands! Now the last team for the first round run team Korea. The last team is Korea. He's ready to go. Wow he was under the shadow of Bruce McQuay all along while in junior national team. This will show our guys have potential. What do you think? They have a shot at medals, don't they? We'll win some gold tomorrow in short track skating. Have you seen a Korean ski jumper? Never. CHA Heon-tae is ready to go. This is a historical moment for Korea... ...competing for the first time ever in ski jumping. It'll be a challenge for him. A challenge it is. He lands! It was beautiful. His flying distance is... 135 meters! It's unbelievable. He is second place after the first round out of 49 athletes. That will put some pressure on other players. CHA Heon-tae was on the US national team. That must've helped. He was an alpine skier. He's great! Korea! Hye-ra? What's that sport? It must be new. Tell us about him. He was a junkie back in high school. In other words, he had a free spirit. He almost lost balance. He shouldn't mess around like that. This is no joke. He needs to be serious. CHOI Heung-cheol is on the start bar. He's getting ready for the first jump. Here he goes. Here he goes. He lands! Oh, he's down! Will he be okay? According to Coach BANG... ...he has problems with landing. You know why? Because he was being cocky! I hope he lands better in the second round. If so, that will put him in the mid or top rank. More power to them. Now MA Jae-bok... Now we have third jumper from team Korea Jae-bok Ma is getting ready to jump. I can't imagine how nervous he is now. But he needs to stay calm and focused. I'd like to say a pose at the jumping moment is very important. Then he can get plus points. He lands beautifully! 128 meters! 59.5 points for MA. He's third place! Way to go, Korea! This is unbelievable. MA Jae-bok! Nobody expected this. I'm shocked. Now we have the last jumper... Meat is burning. - Are you out of mind? - Sorry. I think we have a shot at medals. It's possible. They're doing great. Now the 4th jumper for Korea. KANG Chil-gu! Now, his turn. That's right. I expect that he'll do well. The 4th jumper for Korea, KANG Chil-gu. Being the last jumper how he performs is very important. That's right. He needs to relax. This is their first appearance at the Olympics. They have nothing to lose. He should relax. Anxiety is never good. It's getting foggy. - He should wait. - That's right. Wait. Wait. Wait. They're stopping the game. Well, they are stopping the game now. Why is that? It's due to the fog. It's okay! - It's due to the fog. - Yeah. Safety should be a priority. - Does this happen? - Sure. You can't jump when you can't see. Good thing they've stopped the game. The blue signal just came on. Wait. The blue signal just came on. It seems they are continuing. It looks that way. Look at the clock! You are on! - Is this ok? - No, no. No, something's wrong. A little bit of fog is okay. But it's too foggy to jump. - The clock on the board is working. - It's a different situation. Go back! Don't jump! Go back! The coaching staff needs to complain in this case. Go back! He's getting ready. No, he shouldn't! It's time! Go! You can't jump now! Go back! No! Go! Chil-gu, go back! The jumper cannot identify the situation. Don't jump! Go back! He's getting ready to go. This is crazy. Go back! Get out of there! It's foggier and darker than what you see on TV. This is wrong. They should stop the game. They're resuming the game. This is insane. - They have to stop it! - Yes, this is crazy thing. Coach Bang should appeal! It has to be stopped. They have to stop it! All of the jumps are for judges to decide just everything. He shouldn't jump now. He shouldn't be ready to jump! Oh no, he's not getting up. KANG Chil-gu is down. How could this happen at the Olympics? I hope he's okay. How could this happen? He jumped because he got the signal. They shouldn't have let him jump. He seems in so much pain. From what I see, his ankle fractured. It's completely fractured. I can tell. Now the fog is clearing. They should've waited. This can't be happening at an international event. This is an indelible stain on Nagano Olympics. He'll be out of the game due to injury. This is heart-breaking. How could Japan do this? Way to go, damn Japan! Welcome everyone. Now, we're back here at Nagano for the second round jump is about to begin! He jumps! Balance is good. He's flying far! He lands! Amazing. What a jump. Absolutely amazing! Chil-gu, it's okay. In high school, we won a medal... ...but got them taken away. Look, asshole. Why bring that up? It was your fault. You were high! What are you doing? Knock it off! Heung-cheol I can do it. I can do it. See? I can do it. He jumps! Team Japan is taking first place again! Come on! More! It's okay. Calm down. Korea has changed the entry for the second round. Korea has changed the entry for the second round. Do they have a replacement? The entry has changed. On the new entry... Excuse me. Excuse me. We have KANG Bong-gu. Tell us about him. The long one. See? He's not short. He's tall enough. He has no records. He's on the reserve list. He has no previous records. We trained hard, didn't we? Remember your training? Bong-gu, what did I say? When I jump, don't look down. I will die if I lose balance. That's right. Clean somewhere else. It's too noisy. The second round is about to begin. The captain of team Korea, Heon-tae Cha is about to take his second round. He needs this one badly. CHA Heon-tae is going first. He was adopted to America when he was little. Now he's a key player in our team. He came back to Korea to find his birth mother. He was adopted with his sister when he was 7. I'm sure he'll find her. I believe him. Here he goes. His record is... 138 meters! What's the total score of second period? A total score is 661.4. 661.4! This is amazing! Good thing he came back to Korea! He came back to find his birth mother. Let's watch something else. Hold on! Wait... Wait, please... She must see this! Incredible! The second jumper is on. He shouldn't get greedy. And no messing around. If he does well, we can take fifth place. Team Korea's second jumper is getting ready. He's the one who had problem with his landing. Who knows? They might win a medal. They've been doing great. CHOI Heung-cheol is on. Calm and careful, and he can pull it off. He seemed a bit tense at the first round. Everybody both home and here is waiting for his jump. Here he goes. He starts! Steady! No messing around! We're fifth place! We're moving up from ninth to fifth place! Amazing! We should go for the gold. He's great. Now he can be cocky. He deserves it. Winning a medal is not a dream anymore. Chances are good. He was great! It's their first appearance! Everything is up to the third and fourth jumpers. People are whooping here at the stadium in Nagano. MA Jae-bok is up next. Right. It's an important moment. MA Jae-bok, the third jumper for Korea. This is good chance! He can bring the team closer to a medal. Everybody here is cheering for Korea now. That's sportsmanship. You cheer for the underdog. Earlier tonight I asked MA who his role model was. One that he respects the most. And he said it was his father. You must be proud of him. He's not like other kids. Kids these days do nothing but drink and dance. He sure deserves the gold. He's a good son and a great ski jumper. His father must've influenced him a lot. The talent must run in the family. MA is ready to go. Here he goes. He lands. He receives 59.5! 59.5! I can't even grasp what is happening here at Nagano. We're third place. His father must be very proud of him. I don't wanna jinx it. But we're very close to winning a medal. If the fourth jumper flies over 100 meters... ...a bronze is a sure thing. Can you see that, guys? You can see that blue line. That blue line is at 100 meters. That's right. If he lands past the line, a medal is guaranteed. Now it's up to KANG Bong-gu. All he needs to do is ski down the ramp and jump. There's nothing else to it. Just jump. - It's that easy, right? - Right. It's up to the last jumper, KANG Bong-gu. If he does well, a bronze is theirs for the taking. Everybody is waiting and cheering for him. I've lost my voice. - I hope he makes it. - He will. It's up to him. I'm so proud of them for what they've achieved. Nobody expected this. Now 50 thousand people here are cheering for Korea. Hold on. KANG Bong-gu isn't seen. He should be on the start bar by now. There seems to be a problem. Look at me. Look at me! Focus. I'm scared. Focus and go jump! I'm scared. Jump! What are you scared of? Don't you know why you have to do this? You have to jump so I won't have to go to the military! If I do... You won't be drafted? What are you? A national player. Say it louder. A national player for Korea. Yes, you represent Korea. Go jump now. KANG Bong-gu is on the start bar. 100 meters! That's all he needs. He can't afford any mistakes. It's time for him to show that he has balls! He can do this. He has to do it. I have no doubt that he will. History is in the making for Korea! Everybody back home and people here in Nagano... ...are waiting for his jump. A medal... I can't believe this. KANG Bong-gu is down. Everybody here is worried. It was so close. I saw it exactly. He was good, and everybody is worried. He's not getting up. This is really sad. I have a lump in my throat. It was a last run for the team. He's still down, unconscious. I hope he's okay. Yes, we hope he's okay. Bong-gu? Hey! Hey! Everybody is quiet, waiting for him to come to. Bong-gu! People are suddenly cheering... What sportsmanship. Everybody is hoping for him to regain consciousness. Team Korea did a terrific job. This is so heartwarming. Everybody is hoping for him... He's up! He sprang back up! He sprang back up! They've done their best, and that's what counts. They've shown the world what a strong team they are. Bong-gu! I did well! You're crying? Korea, 13th Place Good job, guys. Short track skating rules. Good job. Really good job. Let's give it another shot in 4 years. PyeongChang is bidding for the next Olympics? - Fine. - You did well. Chil-gu! Grandma? What are you doing here? Don't! My leg! It's broken! I'm happy! Grandma! Hi. Don't you remember me? Oh, Flea Market. You did well. Thanks. Have you found your birth mother? No, not yet. I see. If she's alive, she'll be watching you. Got anything to say? Anything to say to your birth mother? I'm sorry... Anything to say? CHA Heon-tae? Okay. I turned out fine. I want to tell her that... ...she shouldn't feel guilty about having deserted us. And that I'm happy. CHA Heon-tae? Not me. If I met her... ...I wanted to tell her she was bad to dump us. I was looking for her to tell her that. But I haven't gotten an apartment. I have to buy an apartment before I meet her. You heard me, Mom? Wait a little longer. I'll win at the next Olympics and buy an apartment. Just wait for me. You just wait for me! Stop it. Everybody's watching. Call me when you get to the hotel. We'll have dinner. Call me, okay? Heon-tae? Some lady asked me to give you this. 4 years later 2002 Winter Olympics Salt Lake City, USA They've won medals at various international events. There are only 5 ski jumpers on the Korean national team. Directed by Kim Yong-wha, 2009
