[instrumental music] [voice of Wendall] -The morning Helen died, I woke up early. I could hardly believe it. It was snowing in Los Angeles. [soft music] The day before, I called Helen at the hospital. She said "make Fred wear his galoshes and try not to be so obnoxious all the time." She didn't like me very much. She always told me she should have had a puppy or a kitten instead of a kid. Helen's my mother. Fred's my father. That morning when it snowed, I knew Helen would never come home from the hospital. I knew she was going to die. I don't care. I didn't like her anyway. Fred wouldn't turn around or leave the room or anything. Pretty soon after that, he volunteered to go overseas. [announcer calling for train departure] [people singing] [voice of Wendall] -He boarded the train in Hartford. I knew he was going to sit next to me. I can usually tell when something weird is going to happen. -Knock off the singing, hey? Hey? Hey! Knock off the singing. [a man] -Are you kidding? -Your singing gives me a headache. [a man] -Please, mister. [singing resumes] -Where are you going? -Stebbinsville Vermont. [laughs] -You know, the minute I walked in that door, I said to myself "That kid is going to Stebbinsville too." How about that? What, you got folks there? Ah? -Grandfather. -Yeah? Who's that? -Doctor Frederick Oler. -No kidding? You always wear glasses? You don't see very many kids your age wearing glasses. -I'm very nearsighted. -Sure. No offense, man. Don't let it bother you, me talking to you like this. If it does, just say so. I don't want to bother anybody. People are bothered enough about... Do you think I'm young or old? Well, I guess I'm pretty young. Yeah. Let's say so. Definitely. But I'm old too. [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [baby crying] -Only a dollar. -You put that back. -It's all I need. You see, there's a five in there, but am I gonna take it? No, I'm not. -If you don't give that back,I'll do something rotten to you. I want my damn dollar back. -I said shut up. Look, I'm sorry. I'll pay you back. And anyway, I could have taken the five. Look, I'm sorry. [voice of Wendall] -He didn't know I had special powers. That I am a wizard. I could have him arrested. I could make him explode. Alakah! -Stebbinsville. -I know that. -Hey, it's nice to have met you. I enjoyed talking to you. I really did. -You go to hell. [controller] -Gotta hurry it there, Tony. -He's not on it. -Who in hell invited the idiots? [making gun sounds] -Argh! I can't, the Germans just shot me. -John, please. -I'm petrified. -You get up this instant. You'll break every bone in his body, get up this instant. -I'd like to, but I can't. -You're Wendall Bates-OlerI presume? -Are you Fred's father? -That and your grandfather. You'd better give that bag to your uncle John T. before it weighs you over into a permanent bend and gives you halitosis of the elbow. Wendall, this is your cousin Tom. Come on Tom. -My daddy is a soldier in the war. -And this is his mother, Sybil. Come on Sybil, say hello to your nephew. -Hello gruesome. -This is your uncle John T., with his friend Ercel. -Ercel is his girlfriend. [laughter] -And this, of course, is your grandmother, Cornelia. -Hello Wendy. -Hello Corny. -Cornelia. -Wendall. -Well, we'd better get off and running. [instrumental music] -Hello Doc, what you got there? -Freddy's eldestand only. Have him spend some timewith us. -He wears spectacles, isn't he young for spectacles? My word. -I'm very nearsighted, for your information. -Ah yes. [Wendall] -These two are bitty old smartasses. -You'll be lucky to get to bethat old, skunk head. In the process, they may get afew dimples there on thosescaphatic dispellers, but that's no reasonto criticize. You'll be bedding with Tom the terror, little skunk head. Just follow me so you don't get lost. We will have you settled in cheap time. [voice of Wendall] -That's all I needed, being caged in with that littlered-headed baboon. You'd think they'd have the common decency to realize I value my privacy. -Here's my wedding, that's David, my daddy. He's a soldier in the war. Where's your mom and daddy? Have you ever rode a motorcycle? Have you ever shot a gun? What's it look like through big glasses? Don't you talk at all? -If you don't turn off the Goddamn light, I'll slug you. -Okay. What's Goddamn? -It's a swear word for God's sake. -What does it mean? -It means you're angry. -Are you angry? -Yes, very much so, now will youjust go to sleep? -If I turn on the light, will you be more angry? -Yes! -Will you say swear words? -Of course! Now shut up! -Say that, you said you would. Damn it. [muffled] -Turn off the Goddamn light. -Alright, your Goddamn light's turned off. [voice of Wendall] -Dear Fred, your family deserves a gold medal for being a pain in the gluteus maximus. Maybe I'll bring the whole housedown. I'll drop a bomb on it. [instrumental music] I saw a man on the train. He haunts me like a ghost. [dog barking outside] I think he's dangerous. I think I'm dangerous too. -How's your gizzards, boys? -Full of stones! -How about you Wendall? -How about what? -About your gizzards. -You're supposed to say"full of stones!" -Isn't that sort of silly? -Now you listen here, young man. -Hold up granny, this here'san ornery critter from out west. Needs a little time to get adjusted. What bronco ever ate from your hand the first day? -He isn't a bronco. If he doesn't mind his manners,I'll give him one for, I will. -Morning Thomas, how's the woozy wobble? [laughs] -Sleep well gruesome? Mommy, where's my coffee? -Speak respectabely Sybil. -I want more Goddamn cereal. -What? -I want more cereal. -What did you say the first timeMr. Matthewson? -I don't remember. -You better remember or I'll dismember you. -Spill the beans brother,I'm counting. One, two, three [voice of Wendall] -Alakah. [bomb warning siren] [whistle of bomb falling] [explosion] -I heard you say it once mommy. -Oh. Well, don't ever let me hearyou say that again, okay? [instrumental music] -Hey!, where have you been? My daddy, that's his jukebox, uncle John build it. He builded this playhouse too. Mom says uncle John's a genous. -Genius. And built, not build it,for God's sake. -It will hold a trillion recordswhen it's finished. [instrumental music] That is here's the fattest, meanest, ugliest man in town. -Afternoon Doc, Sybil. -Jim, just showing Freddy's boyhere some of the ropes. Name's Wendall. -It's a pleasure Wendall. -Ball player? -Don't know yet, but if he ain't, we'll whip him into shape, I reckon. -I doubt it, I don't like athletics. -Girls who like to sleepin the raw, but worry about somethingto jump into whenthe doorbell rings. -Sybil, do you mind? -Wait a minute, this importantwartime reportage. This is Life magazine. 5% of the women in middle-classfamilies go to sleep naked. And another 17% would like to,but don't. -Just take it easy on the merchandise, will you do me that favor? Nobody will buy it dog-eared. -Everytime it's the same thing. -Forget it, on the house. -I'd just as soon pay. -Headstrong boy. -Got cantankerous California blood. -I'm independent. [instrumental music] [laughs] [voice of Wendall] -They could scrutinize me all they want, even with binoculars, even with a magnifying glass. Who cared. I'd be gone as soon as I stow enough money to finance my getaway. -Thought you flown the coop on us. -You just wait. [instrumental music] -Who are you? -Wendall Bates-Oler. -You're new in town? -No, I've been herefor a couple of centuries. -Why do they call you Wendallsomething like that? How about Wendy? Wendy's a girl's name. -Don't be so blatantly obvious. -You know how to fight, don't you wanker? -Don't scare him too much, he might crap in his pants. -Are you gonna cry? Let's take him to the canand murder him. What's this. Robert Frost. Oh!, poems. Little girls love poems. [kissing sounds] [instrumental music] [smashing sound] -What are you doing in here all alone? -Nothing. -This is no place for a growing boy to be. Go outside and play. A child your age skulking around dark places when the sun is shining. Keep your dirty fingers off my doorjambs. -Wanna you help me catch some pigeons. -Not particularly. -Grandpa said they on thehouse and make a big mess. -So, I can't care less if the whole house got buried in a pile of shit. -Grandpa would give us a dimefor each one we catch. -Yeah? Gimme that, you're all stickied up. -Well, if it ain't my doggoned grandsons. How did you get it boys? Throw a stone. -What did you rascals got there? A mouse? -Don't be stupid grandpa, it's a pigeon. -I don't know, it could be a duck-billed platypus. Yeah. Uh hum. -Can I have a Tootsie Roll? -Sure thing. California? -Nothing. -Hey!, what you doing? Grab it. Get that thing out of here. -I don't see what's the matter with letting a bird sit on your counter. -Oh yeah, look. Look what your bird just done. -It's not gonna hurt your counter. -Listen smart boy. Grab it, okay? -You don't have to be so nice about it. Your friend got a crack in his brain or something? -That's my cousin. I like him 'cause he's different. I'll give him that, alright. [instrumental music] -What you doing Wendy? -We're shooting a bat. -With bows and arrows? Ha! I'd like to see that. -Stick around and I'll pretend you're a bat. -You look as blind as a bat yourself Wendy. Listen, I have a telegram for a Mrs. David L. Matthewson, in care of Oler, she lives here? -Yeah, that's his mother. Give it to me. -Ah ha Wendy. Lookie, lookie but don't touch. I have to get my tip, right? You nuts can't catch a bat with that. -You didn't have to go and tell him, did you? -No. -Hello! -We're going to kill a bat. -You're gonna kill a bat? Hum. I suppose you think you're gonnashoot one of those thingsup in the air and hope that by some strokeof luck... -They'll be going after the cheese. -My grandmother they will. Bats don't bump into anything. There's only one wayto bring those little fellowsdown. Stay right there. -I guess somebody died. -Oh? -Yeah, his old man. So long, Wendy girl. -It must be awfully difficult to hit one of them. -Nah, like taking candyfrom a baby. [gunshot] -Wow!, did you see that? -What's the matter with you boys, shooting that thing off? Haven'y you got any sense in your heads? Get out of here, all of you, scoot! -You'd better come down here Cornelia. Our son has done shot a hippopotamus and it's lying in your pansy bed. -Oh Frederick, are you home? Come upstairs. You don't know what's happened. -What's going on? -I think somebody died. -It was my daddy. [sad music] -hi grampa. -Hello skunk heads. [deep sigh] -You won't mind if I skip the story tonight, will you? Your granddad is a little pooped. Detmoes are giving him a workout again. [laughs] -Did her husband really die? -Yes. He was killed in the war. -You think they'll fly himacross the ocean in a refrigerator? -What do you mean? Oh. I don't know. I hear uncle Johnnykins nabbed himself a flying rat. I mean ah... I saw it, I was there, wasn't I? For the love of, Doc, my brain's getting soft. -Bat's getting blood all over. -Oh. Well ah... Goodnight boys. Right. Don't let the alligators get you. -They won't. [sobbing] -What are you snivelling about? -I don't want my poor dad to be dead. -Kids whose parents are dead are lucky. -I don't care. -Maybe Fred will get shot to pieces too. -Who's Fred? -My father. -Why don't you call him daddy? -I don't know, I've just alwayscalled him Fred. Daddy is pretty infantile, if you ask me. -What's infantile? -Like you. -Well, if he got shot to pieces,will we be twins? -I'm sure. [voice of Wendall] -I thought I would start a scrapbook about the war. I wanted to be prepared, to know everything. Especially about the enemy. They might invade at any time. [footsteps] -What you got going over there? -A war scrapbook. -Uh. -Why aren't you in the war? -'Cause I got my leg busted up in four places, that's why. None of the services consider mefit enough for action. -How did it happen? -See that? Me and my best buddy Duffy Kahler, we got this brilliant idea to build an aerocar. We hung up from the roof up there and ran a cable on the house. Powered it with this old engineI pulled out of a '28 Ford. Worked too. I mean, I was riding that thingonce and Duffy pushed the gearshift forward when he was supposed to pull it back, and ah... [snap] -Splat!, unfit for duty. -You could still join the war effort. [chuckle] -Yeah, push a pencil when guys are dying? Forget it. Duffy though, he joined the AirCorps right out of high school. Valedictorian, college scholarships, most valuable player. Hell, he was a pitcher in the allstate baseball team. You name it, he had it. He chucked it all and joined the Air Corp. -What front did he fight on? -He ah... He was killed. -Oh. Where did it happen? -I don't tknow. There was a bombing raid over Morocco. November 1942. -Have you ever trusted that person? -God, you're a morbid little kid. -Forget it, I was just asking. -You know what this is? -Obviously, I do. -But you don't know it used to belong to your dad. Here. Why don't you hold on to it. [voice of Wendall] -Before, when I used to think about death, it was like thinking about how far away a star is Or about how many people are, right this minute, standing on top of the Empire State Building. Things were different now, blood and guts every time I flipped open a magazine. [instrumental music] [crowd chatter] [children singing] [voice of Wendall] -How do you do Elaine? I was so delighted to receive your card this morning. How thoughtful of you to think of me. You know? We really must get together one of these afternoons, for a soda at the Jubilee. -Going somewhere? -What? -You stole a quarter from my purse this morning, don't think I don't know about it either. I'm onto your ways young man. -I don't know what you're talking about. I certainly did not steal it, there's nothing in this town worth buying anyway. -I don't know why I don't have a stroke, the way some people in this house treat me. -I don't know why you don't either. -Don't smudge the walls like that, And where are my good sewing scissors? -How should I know? -1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6... -For someone special? -None of your business. [chuckle] [instrumental music] -Hey, Elai... Elaine? [knocking] -Skunk head? You must be taking the longest bowel movement in the history of mankind. Soup's on the table you know? [Wendall]-I'm not hungry. -Well, I'd hate to have to breakthe door down a week from now and come upon a starving old skeleton. A growing boy's gotta feed his face sometime. Beside, after dinner, I'm gonna need some expert assistance on my house call. -Why? -Well, you know your granny's afraid I'll drive into a ditch at night without somebody to look out. -Why doesn't she go with you? [door closing] -We're not going in there, are we? -Why not? -It's a slum. -And who are you,the Prince of Wales? [knocking] [child crying] -Evening, Joe. -I forgot which onethe Mrs. told you wasthe dead body. -Eldest one. Go on boy. Show the Doc what you've been crybabying about. [child crying] -Well, let's get this walking mountain's misery overto the bed. Before he drops dead on us. -You heard the Doc boy. He told you to get on over there. -Well, he's hardlyput an ounce. What have you beenfeeding him, feathers? Yeah, look at this. Give me my tool kit Wendall. I don't know if I got a saw big enough. -Now we ain't gonna pay you togive pills and crap to that kid. Goddamn little brat don't want to go to school, that's what it is. -That's blood poisoning Here, take a look. At the end of this road, there should be a bump. There it is. That's a dam. Keeps the disease from spreading. Now, you give a good holler, when I touch the bone. I'm gonna give you a prescription for some pills. -We ain't even got enough moneyto pay you for that cutting up you've done. How much do you figure we owe you for that? -Since it's a Tuesday and the moon is full... On top of that you're my 10,000th customer, I guess i'm gonna have to give it to you free. Unless you know another way? -You won't tell your granny about that, will you? -About what? -Well, about me not charging anything for cutting up that dying horse's ass. -Why? -Well, you know, she can be awful persnickety sometimes. Just might not take kindly to it, that's all. Oh, Lord, love the dark. I'm so hungry, I could eat a Chinese elephant. -He probably would have died if it weren't for you. -The child, died? Don't believe it for a second. Disease goes through those kidslike a clam through a gull. -I still think he would have died. -Years go by so fast, it makes your ears whistle. [instrumental music] [door closing] [John T. whispering] -Duffy. I learned something. I learned something. [unlocking the door] Think. Come on. Call the play. I'm not him. I'm not your son. Go to bed. [crowd chatter] [John T.] -Look at that old geezer. I say if you're too old to fight a war, you're too old to play baseball. -Hey!, hang on John T., you mayjust have to eat those words. [crowd chatter] [crowd cheering] -I don't care what it was, I'm cold and I hate baseball. -Ah!, games are importantto a boy. Teach him how to hold his own with the team and be dependent on others and have others dependent on him. -I'm not dependent on anybody. -Alright, if you're gonna besuch a sourpuss, why don't youstay home the next time. That face of yours is so long,it looks like you're gonna bumpyour chin on the ground. -Boy, how you got to be mybrother Freddy's kid, I'll neverknow. -Fred didn't like sports either. -What? -He would never go to a game with me. He was too educated for that. He wouldn't yell and scream over nothing. -Nah, you've got it wrong pal. Helen didn't like sports. Freddy had the highest battingaverage in the state. -Hey, hey! -Well, just tell him to go suck his head. [instrumental music] [voice on the radio] -What are you drawing? -We raise them out back. We got lots so it don't hurt usnow to give out these hens. Ma says it's a retribution, kind of your grampa fixin' me up. Give a hand here Tod. -I guess they're ours. -Ah! I'm gonna torture the bastards. -I didn't know they made noise. [music on the radio] [instrumental music] [water splashing] [sobbing] -Duffy? Duffy, is that... Is that really you? Duffy. Can I come closer? -What is that? -Prayer flags. So the wind can carry your prayers to someone you love. Duffy? -You thought I was dead, didn't you? Everybody thinks I'm dead. Can you beat that? -No. What happened? -Well, it is a secret. Everything is a secret. What's his name? -Who? -The little boy. -Who, Thomas? -The little red-headed boy, you know? -Thomas. -How old is he? -He's four. -He's mine, isn't he? -Yes, of course. -I heard you got married. -I did. When Thomas was three. But he was killed too. I mean, he was killed. John T., he cried when you died. [sobbing] It just doesn't seem fair that you're back. -You won't tell 'on me, will you? -What do you mean, tell on you? -I mean what I say, Sybil. -Your shoe's untied. -If it doesn't happen real soon, I'm gonna... -You could go back to school. -Yeah. Me and the rest of the flunkies. Listen to chalk talks while our pals get riddled full of holes. -You really miss Duffy, don't you? Pretty soon the war will be over. -Ah, nah. Nah, this waris never gonna end. Fits this lousy worldlike a glove. -All I can say to help you, John T., is I love you with all my heart. -Sure. But you won't make love with me. -I explained that. -I know, I know, good girls wait'till they're married. Intercourse, just for the hellof it, is pornographic and we're bound to losesight of love, et cetera,et cetera. -Yes. -Of course, a girlwith a guy on leave doesn't worryabout consequences. But I'm no soldier,so you can wait. And meanwhile, I can masturbate. -What's masturbate? -Shhhh. -Nah, forget it, that wasa stupid thing to say. Come on, don't die on me, okay? [laughs] [voice of Wendall] -People were getting fed up with the war. They were tired of calculating how many stamps and which book got you how many points on a pound of butter. And they became crabby when theycouldn't get enough gasoline toget them where they were going. Even the Boy Scouts, on their eternal war scrap drives, could no longer be assured a little hero's welcome. -Come in here. Hey!, come in here. -I love chocolates. Here, find him in the viewer. Here, and press this button. There you go. -He's gone. -Well, he'll come back, just keep watching. -Ah, I was wondering something. -What? -It's really nothing. -What? -It's about death. When a person's heart stops beating... Is he really dead? Or could he still be thinking or feeling something? Oh my God!, look. [camera shutter] [church bell] [children playing] [instrumental music] -15 minutes after sunrise,over Normandy, U.S. and Britishtroops began to pull ashore. Some of them had flowers in their gun muzzles. By 10:30 in the morning, bulldozers were carving out temporary airstrips on the beach. To crusaders on... -And what? [bicycle bell ringing] -Sorry Wendy girl. -It's our property. We have the right to sit on a piece of wood. I'm gonna do something dire to that son of a bitch. We have an alienable right to sit on our porch steps unmolested. And I'm gonna see that those rights are protected. -Why don't we shoot him, like in the war? -Nah, I can't just go up and shoot somebody. No, that wouldn't be right. Wanna try that again Jimmy? Just wanna try that little trickof yours again, huh? [dramatic music] -Alakah. -Ah! No! No! [crashing sound] -Wendall. Oh God. Oh!, God. -Oh no, not again, I justreplaced this window. -That's not funny. -I know. [laughter] -Hey! Hello? Who's in there? -Don't come in here. I don't want you to. -Why are you there? -I just came, if you leave,I'll go away. I will never come back,I promise. -You've been around here before. -No, it's the first time. -You're lying. Where do you live? Do you have a place to live? -Yes. -Are you hiding? Have you done something wrong? -No. Can't you shut up? -You don't scare me one bit. Are you a soldier? Are you sick? And where's my money? -Shut up about your money. I don't owe you any money. -You don't have a beard. [voice of Wendall] -Dear Fred, I am making a scrapbook about the war. Eventually, I hope that this work will result in my gaining a historical perspective. -General Eisenhower... [instrumental music] [voice of Wendall] -Dear Fred, the war must be terrible. In ways we can't imagine here. Do you sleep in muddy foxholes in the rain? Have you seen your friends get killed? Are you ever afraid it might happen to you? Do you ever... Do you ever think of me? -Just don't get killed Fred. [door opening] -What, is this morning? Hey, where are we going? -What day is today? It's the 4th of July, right boys? -Right. [firecrackers] [fanfare music] [firecrackers] [firecrackers] [firecrackers] -We are going to call the police. -Go ahead! [sound of bomb falling] [explosion] -Woohoo! -Boy, they sure got scared! -Yeah, I bet they thought the Germans landed right here in Vermont. -That wouldn't be right boys, to leave a job unfinished. Rise and shine? [fanfare music] [firecrackers] Run for it! -Grampa! [screams] [screams and cries] -Oh lord, a skunk. -Skunk! Would that be what I smelled? -Daddy, what are gonna do? Use him for fertilizer? -Nah, just leave him out here to stink to death. -What am I gonna do? I don't want to stink one minute more. I hate all the bastard skunks that ever were invented. -There's no need to swear young man. Get your clothes off. This family is crazy,that's what it is. -Now you just wait, watch this. Slowly. Slowly, that's the way. Show 'em thatgolden overtouch. -Attaboy Johnny. -I just know that damn animalwould have squirt him. If only the people in thisfamily weren't such fools. -Shhh. -Got it! -Judas Priest, so he does. -Ah ha ha! -Now, what the devildo you plan to do with it? -Ah, I'm gonna give it to Wendall. -No, I don't want it. -Let's put him in the bathtub and squirt all the cologneup his bottom witha chicken baster. -What do you say? [instrumental music] -Test it if it's open. -It's open. -Now I'm gonna count to three and pop her in. And you shut that door faster than you've ever shut anything before, okay? -Yeah. -Ew. -Alright. One, two, shit! Run! [screams] -Damn, damn, damn! [screams] -Oh my God! [coughing] -Oh, Jesus H. Christ. -Mommy will reallyhit the ceiling. -Yeah, she'll probably make a dent in it. [fireworks] [instrumental music] -It's hot. I figure the earth's flown too close to the sun or vicey versey. -I think it's all them bombs they drop from the fighter planes that's tampering with the atmosphere worldwide. Now who gave anybody the right to throw a bum like Leonard against an ace like Trout? Oughta be a federal crime. Imagine Trout startingfor the third time in six days. -If he was down for the sixthtime in six games wouldn'tmake a difference. -I wouldn't be surprised if hegets shelved beforethe fourth inning. -Right, right. [baseball game on the radio] -I went way back and stopped over at the Oaklands'. Three of their kids have german measles,. -Oh! -I call it downright unpatriotic. -Biological warfare. I saw a U-boat in the riveryesterday morning. -I've got a boogerin my potatoe. -That's not a booger Thomas. When we find a foreign object inour meal, we do not pick it up and shout out the factto everybody. -Don't come in here. Oh!, you scared me. -Did I ruin everything? -Ah!, no, only some. [chuckle] -I like it. I like it here in this place. -What are you going to doto us, Duffy? -Hey, come here. -I'm here. -Come closer. [instrumental music] Closer. [chuckle] Come closer. Hey, come here. [laughs] Closer. [laughs] -Look at him. -Hum. -You love him? He's poison, like me. -No. Something awfulmust have happened. -We just need to find the pieces. Put the pieces together. -I could help you. I'd like to. -Say you won't tell. I could hurt youif you won't say it. -I mean it. -I won't tell. [music on the radio] [motorcycle engine] [motorcycle engine] -What are you looking at? What are you doing? -Just cutting off a little. -Can I have a ride? -Are you sure? -I'm not afraid, if that's what you mean. -Hop on. [motorcycle engine] [Wendall] -Stop! Stop!, I don't want to ride! I don't want to ride! Please, please stop. I'm going to vomit. -I'm not stopping every 50 yardsso you can upchuck by the sideof the road. Make up your mind right now,you want to ride, don't you? -I want to ride. -Okay, no more complaints. -You don't mind if I get sick all over you? -Nah, just turn your headto the side, it won't eventouch me. -Are you going to marry Ercel? -Hell, I may have to. She won't let me touch her otherwise. -But you don't thinkyou want to? -Hum. Thinking's got nothing to do with it. It's a mysterious and terrible power that women wield. Sex. [birds chirping] -Did you ever know my mother? -Freddy brought her by. [chuckle] -No, your daddy was not imune. -I hated her. -Nice people aren't always as perfect as we'd like 'em to be. [motorcycle engine] -What's wrong with you? -Nothing. -I'd like to know who gave you permission to go off riding on that motorcycle? -I am in no mood to talk to anybody. -Well, you just put yourself in the mood young man. You go straight upstairs and take a bath. You must be filthy. [Sybil] -I'm not out to trick you, can't you believe me? [Duffy] -I don't know. I have to be smart. I have to be careful. I'm crazy, aren't I? [Sybil] -No, don't say that. God, how I've missed you. -Careful what you start Sybil. -When I was big with Thomas, my parents sent me offto live with, well... Really to hide out withmy aunt Vicky in New York. Oh... They were so ashamed. So afraid that Stebbinsville would find outthat their daughterwas gonna have a child, out of wedlock. And no one knewthe father was you. I was so alone. I used to go to the parkand sit on a bench and... Bask in the sunlightlike a fat old turtle and wait. And wait. And I didn't care if the wholeworld disapproved. You know what I'd remember? I'd remember how after thegames, when you'd be allbeat up and tired and... You couldn't stay awake,hardly, remember? Remember? And all you'd wanna dowas be with me. Then we'd come here... We'd walk... And not talk. And you'd hold me. So very, very gently. Hold me like that Duffy. Oh, go on. What? -I've got this bullet in the back of my head. It's a Nazi bullet. They sent me from over there and put me into a hospital. They'd put me in with a bunch of nutcases. They kept calling me lieutenant Dough. I couldn't stand it so I... I walked out right under their noses. And in broad daylight. I was hungry. I... I grabbed this little girl's purse. And I ran. You should see me run. They couldn't catch me. They shouted at me, yelled after me. The cop shot at me. But I left them in the dirt. My legs are fine. I can still run. Feel the muscles on my calves. Feel -Your legs are still strong. What happened after the purse? -Don't. You can't make me tell you anything. Nothing more. I must be crazy to tell you anything. -No Duffy, don't go away. Stay with me. -Get the hell off of me. Don't. [screams of pain] [coughing] [screaming] [coughing] -Go away! I don't care about you. I don't want to ever see you again. [crying] [dramatic music] [screaming] [knocking] -Sybil? [instrumental music] [voice of Wendall] -If I told the sheriff and they found him, they might kill him. Or lock him in jail. She loves him. The wizard will protect her. Alakah. -The Tigers were just givingthem a taste at first. So, as when the Browns lose,they'll have at least knownwhat it was like. Don't you think so California? -Yes. -Yeah! Now, you've gotta kneadthe leather all over. But don't forget,only a little bit at a time. That was your dad's glove,wasn't it? -Yes. I'll take this Baby Ruth too. -It's your brand, I see. -Yeah. -I'll put it on your bill. That's a good luck gloveyou got. A lot of historyin that leather. You rub it in real goodand it'll come back to life. [ball hitting the ground] -It's not just gonna plop in your glove, you gotta... Connect with it while it's still in the air. Alright, give it here. That's better but, you're too tight, And even if you did catch the darn thing, it'd probably bounce right out -Let me try it again. -Okay. Ready? [breathing out] -You'll get it. [instrumental music] [indistinct speech] -I won. -Hello there fellows. Folks home? -Yes. -You guys seen that picture? -No. -It's not worth it. It's a comedy. It's got nothing to do with the war. I've been in the war. You'd better believe, it's no comedy. You know how far the war is from us right now? This is us. And this is the war. You know how many miles of oceanthere are between this hand and this hand? -Which war? The European war or the African war? The Pacific would, I suppose from here to Europe, it's approximately... -3000 miles. Maybe more. All the Nazis should be chopped into pieces with machetes. Wait a minute, will you? How would you two soldiers like an ice cream cone? Or a sundae? Anything you want. -We have to go. -I don't want to go,I want ice cream. -If you don't come, I'll kick you down the stairs when we get home. -I'm not afraid of you. -Alright, but we have to hurry. -If you like the wind, because I do. -So do I. -Ah! Don't you wish you had wings? --Uh-huh. -Me too. I'm not the kind of guy... that can stay in one place too long. 'Cause, pretty soon,... Before you even know it, People have to go and stick their nose into your business. -Yeah. -You like the wind? -You already asked him that. -Nah. No I didn't. What are you blabbering about? I got this idea. That... If you let yourself get blown around, wherever, eventually, when the wind dies you just... drop down into the right spot. [instrumental music] Tom and I have to go. But thank you very muchfor the ice cream,don't we Tom? -I don't wanna go. -Grandma said, at 10 'till 5,we have to be on the town hallsteps or else. -Ah ha. -Okay for you brother. I just hope I'm not aroundwhen you catch hellfor not showing up. [screaming] [car horn] -Stop!

[indistinct yelling] -Looks like we're going to haveto amputate his head. -He's got a concussion, I just know it. -Time to get through with him We'll have a zipper sewn on there so that he can take off the old scaphatic dispeller then clean out the detmoes. -What went on here,what happened? -Some guy, he beat the kid with an ice cream dish. -He did what? Who, for Christ's sake? -Nobody I know, I did get to look at him but it seemed to... -Okey-dokey. How's your gizzards? -Full of stones. -That's what I like to hear.

I told you I didn't, butyou wouldn't believe me. I'm the little robber. The ugly little brat who gets blamed for everything. [instrumental music] [voice of Wendall] -I don't know what death is like, I've never seen it. If only, in closing my eyes fora minute, I could be dead. I might be able to float above this place and protect them. -Don't cry, you'll drown. [voice of Wendall] -Alakah. Detmo. -Stay warm you two wounded indians. I saw the boogie man fly away so you're safe now. -You have to promise me neverto say anything about that man. -Why? -Because we want himto be a secret. Between just you and me.
