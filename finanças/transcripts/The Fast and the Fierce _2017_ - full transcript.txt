Alexis, what is this? [PLAYING BACK RECORDING] MALE: Good afternoon, Captain. If you land the plane, you die. Before departing Sao Paulo, an overriding mechanism was attached to your plane's stabilizer system. Once the aircraft descends past 1,500 feet above ground level, its guidance systems will be programmed to malfunction. This will also jam the transponder radar, making you undetectable to other aircraft. If the plane rises above 1,500 feet or falls below 500 feet, ASL, the stabilizer system will fail, severing the hydraulic lines and making the craft completely uncontrollable. This will cause the plane to break apart in mid-air, killing everyone on board and others on the ground. If anyone gets off the plane, I'll destroy it. If anyone tries to get on the plane, I'll destroy it. I'm controlling the device remotely with limited range. If you fly out of a 20 mile radius of LAX, the device will lose my signal and short-circuit the system. I will disable the system remotely once I get what I want. CAPTAIN: What's the altitude? - We just crossed 3,000 feet. - You gotta pull up. Captain? CAPTAIN: So-Cal Approach, this is La Vida 12-24. We have a possible terrorist threat. CO-PILOT: Possible?

Who gave the flight attendant this recording? We're 2,000 feet! Do something. CO-PILOT: Captain? - Alexis, who gave it to you? It was in the cart. Anyone could have put it there. 1,800 feet! So-Cal Approach, we once again request permission- By the time they give us permission we could all be dead. JC, what the hell are you doing? ♪ La Vida 12-24, you do not have clear airspace.

The captain said they received a terrorist threat onboard the aircraft from a recording device. Michaels, has the airport or any other plane received a similar threat? There has been no reported activity on any terrorist watch lists. Who told you that, TSA? Those guys have less sense than God gave Iraq. I printed out the plane's manifest.

Any luck with that jamming device? That's a negative. What did Captain Safir find? JC: Still searching the bay. He left me in charge of the flight deck. [KNOCKING] JC, are you crazy? The only reason why you and everyone else on this plane are still alive because of the decisions I've made, not Khalib. If it weren't for my quick thinking, he would have tried to land this plane. - ALEXIS: He was just trying to do the right thing. - But I did the right thing. Me. As long as he's not on this cockpit, I'm in charge. [GASP] Just those gnarly Santa Ana winds acting up. Dropping down a bit should take care of it. See? Things are better already. Why don't they just land? Hey. Why don't you tell us what's really wrong or land the plane? - What's the pro... - Sir. Please go back to your seat. Uh-oh. The rats are about to overtake the kitchen. I want to know why the captain is locked out of - his own flight deck. - MATT: Sir, this is official business. - Please have... - Don't. Don't bully me, buddy. - I'm not bullying anyone. - My wife's hurt. And this plane has destroyed city property and everyone's scared as hell. - Like the captain has said, it is a mechanical issue. - Bull. I have a right to know. Sir, please. Go back to your seat. Unless you want to explain to your beer-bellied friends why a flight attendant from West Hollywood broke your arm, I suggest you go back to your seat and not hit me. Now sir, please have a seat and let the captain continue his explanation. I won't have violence on my flight. Just got a little congested. That's all. I won't hurt anyone. Good. Because we're in enough trouble as it is. You all deserve to know we received a terrorist threat. This plane will crash if we try to land. And why aren't you flying the plane? The terrorist is in there, isn't he? He's one of the pilots. My copilot and I just had a misunderstanding, that is all. What, he locked you out of the cockpit? What did you do to the bottom of the plane? I saw him go down there. WOMAN: I saw him. I have a feeling I know who the terrorist on this plane is. It isn't the first time someone like you has put a flight at risk. - Someone like me? - Yeah, someone like you. I knew as soon as I got on board this plane and saw what you looked like, this flight was in trouble. - This is getting out of control. - KURT: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - KURT: Where are you going? - I'm going to go do something. - KURT: Up there? - Yeah. I'm going to take my chances. - You'll just make it worse. I'm American. Just like you. Nah, man. You ain't nothing like me. - You ain't nothing... - DONNA: Hey Texas! Knock it off. You want to hit him, you're going to have to hit me first. - You're protecting him? - I'm protecting all of us. Now sit down, put your seat belt on, and listen to our Captain. - But- - SHUT UP! [TURBULENCE] Everyone into your seats. Now! [TURBULENCE] [BEEPING] Just a little navigation error. Diverting power from the main generator to the battery to get the elevator back online. - The captain should be in here. - Hey. Hey. JC: You may be willing to put your life in his hands, but I'm not. You can't fly this alone. I've got this. Alright. I've just got to lean into the pivot to correct it like I did before. MICHAELS: Sir. We have visual of the 757 heading into the Hollywood Hills. - We are in position to shoot down the wing... - Jesus Christ, What is happening on that plane? La Vida 12-24, this is Coleman. You have ten seconds to redirect your flight pattern or we are taking invasive action. [THUD] We can correct it. Turn 50 degrees to the left and increase the throttle when I say mark. Ready? Uh. Yeah. Three. Two. One. Mark. [CRASHING] JC, we'll discuss what happened when we are on the ground. And right now that's my number one priority, getting home. CAPTAIN: But I need your cooperation. CAPTAIN: No grudges. No ulterior motive. Otherwise whoever is behind this has already won, and these passengers will die because you and I can't get along. Khalib, I- We'll discuss this when we land. Sir, this is now a domestic terrorist attack on United States soil. The President has been informed and wants your feedback whether or not to shoot it down. Now, I would be remiss if I didn't tell you that our estimates calculate minimal civilian casualties if we take action now. Seventy two people. That seems minimal. It may be our only option. Michaels. Yes, sir. How fast can you get me on that plane? [SIGH] [TYPING] [ON TELEVISION] ANCHOR WOMAN: I mean, come on, really Kelly. ANCHOR WOMAN: Do you even know what honest hard working Americans are on board? ANCHOR WOMAN: I mean, sources insist this isn't a hostage situation but a mechanical... - Let me call her. - ANCHOR MAN: So this isn't a terrorist situation... BENJY: Come on. At least let me text her back. [TELEVISION PLAYING IN BACKGROUND] Listen. I can't have her think that I don't care. Look. I need her to know that I should have gone with her. And I know that now. [TELEVISION AT A DISTANCE] REPORTER #1: ...to protect us, and our entire country - could be destroyed. I blame the President. - REPORTER #2: Absolutely. REPORTER #1: It's always his fault. I mean, not the one coming in. REPORTER #1: You remember the plane that disappeared? BENGY: What are you doing? [TELEVISION PLAYING] REPORTER #2: They didn't have enough peanuts. REPORTER #1: They didn't have enough peanuts. Alright. Back to you guys. COLEMAN: I will enter through the cargo hold. At your low altitude, there should be no danger of pressurization loss. It will just be windy as hell. The doors will depart at the rate of sixty knots on the ground. ALEXIS: How many of you are coming on board? [COLEMAN OVER RADIO] Two. Myself and a specialists gonna try and rewire the circuitry to the stabilizer system. You know how to disable it? COLEMAN: My team analyzed the photos captain Safir sent. I'm not gonna lie. This is going to be trickier than trying to get a mule to mate with a sheepdog. When should we open the doors? COLEMAN: In two minutes our plane should be aligned with yours. Open a hatch and we'll zip line over. You need to slow to a speed of 150 to 175. That's too low. We'll burn right through our fuel reserves. ALEXIS: Guys, we shouldn't be doing this. The instructions were very clear- no outside interference. CAPTAIN: In about twenty minutes, we'll have no more fuel and no plane. ALEXIS: Okay. Fine. I'll go down and guide them in. MATT: I'll be right behind you. - JC: With that eye? No way. Don't get too comfortable. I'll be right back. ALEXIS: I can go by myself. I'd love to pin all of our hopes and dreams on you, but I only have one pin left. I'm all out of dreams. Are you guys sure there's not another way? We are breaking the rules. JC: Stop talking and start walking. Just try to keep it steady and don't dump me out. Although I wouldn't blame you if you did. We're in position! Open the doors! You got your seat belt on? DONNA: Yeah. KURT: Tight? DONNA: I think so. KURT: Make sure. [BREATHING HEAVILY] PTSD? Huh? Post traumatic stress disorder. You're showing the symptoms. - Is that obvious, huh? - DONNA: Do you have something you take for it? - Do you need me to get your bag? - KURT: No. No no no no no no. Just- Just hold my hand. That works best. [EFFORTS] [DOOR OPENS] [ALEXIS SCREAMING] [YELLING] Do I have adequate coverage to get a clean purchase? JC: The wall is clear! ALEXIS: Aim high so you miss the baggage! COLEMAN: Move over! Both of you! JC: The hook is secure! Come on! Let me call Donna! You know she can call off the rescue. BENJY: What do you want? I obeyed all your rules. Look! The transfer is almost done. Then you'll get paid. I don't want to get paid. I just want my wife! Line is secure! I'm coming over! Stop climbing! It's not me. The plane's climbing on it's own. [ALEXIS SCREAMING] ALEXIS: Oh my God! We broke the rules! They warned us it was going to happen, but we didn't listen. - COLEMAN: The planes have to be parallel for me to get over! - It's not me. COLEMAN: You're going to snap the line! [JC SCREAMING] JC: No! Not until they're in! [SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] [DONNA SCREAMING] Everybody turn away! Don't look! Deploying our landing gear to create some drag and slow our ascent. Why won't it stop? [EFFORTS] [SPARKS / BUZZING] Well? Well, what? It didn't work. Khalib, you okay? How much damage did the plane take from our hit? The circuitry in both wings is so damaged. We could short out any second. There's only 800 pounds of fuel left. Do we have enough for another shot? No. Is LAX clear? It's totally evacuated. Escort us to the airport. That way the casualties on the ground will be minimized when this plays out. And there's a chance some of us will survive. This is not over. This is La Vida 12-24 setting a course for LAX. KHALIB: Make sure Alexis is okay. And prepare the passengers. BENJY: Here's your damn code, okay? Now just- let the plane land. [SIGH] What? What is it? Is there something wrong? You can't make it land? Kurt, is there anybody that you want to text or message? You can use my phone. No, no, no. I got my own phone. Thanks. KURT: I can fix this. I know I can. - Sit down. - [SCOFFS] Why won't you let me help? You can help by having a seat and letting the professionals handle this. MATT: Whoa. Alexis needs help. Whoa. Whoa. Sit down. - Oh my God! Are you okay? - Don't... Don't ask me how I feel. I'm not okay. ALEXIS: I told them. I told them that this would happen. But they didn't listen. Why doesn't anyone ever listen to me? - MATT: Sir, I absolutely cannot. Now, sit down. - Just give me ten seconds to check it out. What do you have to lose? Let me get down there and take a look. MATT: If you don't sit down right now... What could be more threatening than me being on this plane right now? ALEXIS: What's the problem? Oh. There's not a problem. KURT: I'm just offering a solution. MATT: Alexis, this... - ALEXIS: Oh. No, no, no. ALEXIS: What can you do? Let me look what's going on in the Avionics Bay. I used to dismantle all kinds of crap in Iraq and I bet my life what's down there is very similar. Now, it maybe too complicated. I don't know. But at least let me give it a shot. MATT: Whoa, whoa, whoa. What do you plan on doing with that? I can either try to save the plane or open a can of beans. - Which do you prefer? - ALEXIS: Hurry up! It's this way. MATT: We can't have passengers in the restricted area. - ALEXIS: I'll be his escort. MATT: We need captain's approval. Matthew, get off it already! I just saw JC die in front of me. I tried to save him and I failed. Now this man is offering to help us. And you're saying he can't because it's against FAA protocol? ALEXIS: Do you see anyone else here offering to help? ALEXIS: I didn't think so. Move! I'm just trying to do the right thing. I know. No, you don't. Because if we do survive this, I'm fired. KURT: Good news. KURT: I think I can help. [ELECTRIC SHOCK] Aah! Dammit! There's too much internal electrical damage. What do you mean? It means we're screwed. DONNA: Where's Alexis? - Get back to your seat. Where's Alexis? Get away from him! KURT: Donna, that doesn't belong to you. ALEXIS: Donna, what are you doing? MATT: Both of you. Back to your seats. There's a reason you were so concerned with this bag. You knew it was your way out if something went wrong. That's standard military issue. DONNA: Is that what this is? ALEXIS: Oh my God. You're the terrorist. Sir. Step back and have a seat on the jump seat. If I was a terrorist, then why would I try to dismantle the device? Sir. I suggest you don't say another word until we land the plane and the proper authorities are involved. But she stole from me! MATT: Sir, sit down, okay? And we can sort this all out. Why? So I can be the fall guy? ALEXIS: Matthew, quick, get the extension cord so we can strap him down. ALEXIS: He's dangerous. He can't be trusted. KURT: Bitch! [SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] Bullrush me and I'll slit her fucking throat. Let her go, man. Don't do this. [KURT LAUGHS] Everybody out. Now. KURT: Now! KURT: You. You stay. You. Come with me. KURT: Come on. KURT: That's good. Come on. KURT: Come on. KURT: Come on. Stop. - Open it. - MATT: What? At this altitude we don't have to worry about pressurization. KURT: Don't you think I thought of that? KURT: Now be a good girl. Turn around and help me put that parachute on. KURT: I didn't know you were a dancer. KURT: Come on. You know about teamwork. You're married, right? KURT: Help me. Middle strap. Not bad. How's that door coming? [WIND] [DONNA SCREAMS] Now Donna! Hold on to me, tight! You're coming with me! KURT: Didn't you know? - You're the ransom. - ALEXIS: You're not taking her! [SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] [EXPLOSION] Flight crew to flight deck. Flight crew to flight deck. [DOOR BEEPS] KHALIB: Who opened the emergency door? And what got sucked into the engine? I think it was the terrorist who put the device on the plane. And also the only man that could save us. MATT: This was found in his belongings. MATT: Some kind of signal box. KHALIB: Radar jamming equipment. DONNA: I was sitting next to the terrorist this whole time. I held his hand. - [ALARM BEEPING] - Oh my God! What's wrong now? We have only seven minutes left. MATT: So, we can land the plane? Not with those devices still attached. Those devices. They're rigged to make us crash, right? [FRUSTRATED] Yes! We've been over this. So we just have to find a way to crash this plane first. COLEMAN: You want to do what? That overriding device isn't as complicated as it appears. Pull up the photos I took earlier. COLEMAN: Looking at them right now. The overriding equipment is powered by the aircraft just like the equipment on the plane. The call lights, the water heaters, USB ports. KHALIB [ON RADIO]: Zoom in on the right side of the first photo I took. KHALIB: Look at the wires that are attached. They feed directly into a unit that looks like a compressor of some kind. Exactly. Which means its only getting its power by the aircraft and its generators. Not the battery or the back-up. If the device loses its power source, it will go dead and no longer able to carry out the malfunction to cutting the hydraulic lines. CAPTAIN: Right now I'm only running on a few pounds of fuel and one engine. With my fuel gone, I will lose power and have to initiate a glided landing. But the motor from the right engine will still be powering the generator, which means the device will be active and initiate a malfunction once I fall below 500 feet. But if I no longer had that engine to power the generators... Then there would be no aircraft power for the device to feed off of. Is there anyway for you to cut the engine? No. But you can. I need the F-18 that's been tailing us to shoot out the engine. Prepare the cabin. CAPTAIN: We're going home. Why isn't it landing? Thank you for your services. Here's your payment as agreed. What? May I have my code, please? Not until my wife is safely on the ground. Unforeseen errors have occurred. Now I suggest you take this money and leave. Now. Once they finish sifting through the debris from that plane, they're going to find out that the code that cause the malfunction was created by B. Samuels of GioTech. How? While you were transferring data onto my drive, it was also transferring data onto your system. - My wife is still in the sky. The deal was she'd be on the... - You can buy another one with all the money that I'm giving you. Now give me my drive. [COCKS GUN] Give me my drive. Fine. I'll take the deal. May I? Women in Dubai, huh? You think they'll go for a guy like me? Give me my drive. So this is ten million dollars in a Swiss Bank Account. How do I possibly know that this is any good? It activates with a simple code online. Which I will give you once you give me my drive. No. You first. Shall we? [SIGH] Go ahead and boot this us. BENJY: And we can be... [THUD / JULIETTE SCREAMS] [THUD] [STRUGGLES / GROANS] [STRUGGLES / GROANS] [SCREAMING] Tell me how to save my wife! I'm sorry. She was dead before we even started. JULIETTE: I'm sorry. [DEEP INHALE] [GUNSHOT] So-Cal Approach, I have visual on LAX tarmac. Will begin descent for an emergency landing on Runway 2-5 left. CONTROLLER [ON RADIO]: Roger that, La Vida 12-24. How's your fuel? Still a few drops to run on. Khalib, do you know what you're doing? KHALIB: No. Do you? The ammunition the F-18 carries is about the size of a coke bottle. Should only take a few rounds to blow out the engine. COLEMAN [ON RADIO]: We've assured the pilot is one of the finest Top Guns in the nation. Targeting system is top-notch. This could go downhill fast. Everybody to the backside of the plane. Come on. Let's go. Okay. It wasn't a full flight so there's plenty of space. MATT: Away from the engines. Away from the engines. MATT: Where's Alexis? So-Cal Approach, once we've lost power, I'll switch to my cell phone so we can still communicate. CONTROLLER [ON RADIO]: Confirmed. Flight crew. Please prepare for emergency landing. Okay. Fasten your seat belts. Strap yourselves in. Heads down. Knees up. MATT: Heads down. Knees up. Alexis! DONNA: I'll go get her. I'll go get her. Please. Please sit beside me. If we're going to die, I want my daughter to think I wasn't alone. [PILOT] Target confirmed. Will commence fire in fifteen seconds. DONNA: Alexis? Alexis? Alexis, where are you? Alexis? [TURBULENCE] So-Cal Approach, I'm on glide and on course. DONNA: Alexis! - ALEXIS: Yeah. I'm back here. DONNA: What are you doing? - ALEXIS: Donna, I'm so scared. I know. Me too. But we have to sit down. [JET PILOT] 10, 9, 8, 7, 6... I don't know how I'm going to do this. Just don't think about it. Come on. Come on. Will you help me? - Yeah. - Okay. I can count on you to cooperate? Yeah. What do you need me to do? DONNA: Alexis. Don't scream. [JET PILOT] Fire! [SCREAMING] [EXPLOSION] [SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] [GRUNT] [SCREAMING] It was never supposed to go there. We arranged to blow up your hotel in Brazil, but you shot that plan to hell when you decided to leave early. [SCREAMS] [SCREAMS] Now that you see how easy it is for me to kill you, let's discuss what will keep you alive. ALEXIS: The code for Genesis 7. - The code is Benjy's. It's not mine! ALEXIS: But you're married, right? Fifty-fifty, huh? So it's technically yours. Donna! Donna! Is that you? - BENJY [ON PHONE]: Donna, are you still on the plane? - Benjy! Oh, Benjy! Do you have the code for Genesis 7? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Who wants it? I should have never hesitated. I know that now, okay? All I want is you. I know. I know you do. Tell him. Now. Donna. Listen, I love you. I love you too, Benjy. I couldn't bare to live without you. I know that now. And that's why you have to forgive me. For what? I'm going to let you save me. [GRUNTS] [SCREAMS] [GRUNT / THUD] [SCREAMING] MATT: Hold on tight! [PASSENGERS SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] [CRASH] [SKIDDING] What happened to Alexis? DONNA: It was her. The terrorist was her. [SIRENS APPROACHING] Captain Khalib. Agent Coleman. KHALIB: You took your time. MICHAELS: Congratulations. Sir. I'm ashamed of my behavior and I owe you an apology. But I was right. You're not like me. You're better. [CHUCKLES] That's kind of you to say. God. I need a drink before I see the brat. Who has a good martini? One of my favorite places in Echo Park. Well, come on. I'll buy it for you. You mean, you're going to buy me a drink? Oh no, honey. After what we've been through, I'm going to buy you the whole damn bar. Come on. [SNAP] Mmm. [SNAP] DONNA: Benjy! I love you more than everything. You did it. We did. So, what do you want to do now? Start over. Hey. Hey. Listen. I owe you a real honeymoon, okay? I do. Together. Just you and me. We can go anywhere you want. Alright? Just tell me. We can fly out tonight if you want. [SIGH] Let's just drive please. [LAUGHING] Are you Hans Fensen? Yeah. Today you're going to make one of two choices. ♪♪
