[atmospheric music playing] [birds chirping] [atmospheric music continuing] [Jane Goodall] This is a story of planetary hope inspired by one of the biggest ideas of the century, the fate of our planet may depend on a new food science that grows real meat directly from animal cells without the need to breed, raise, and slaughter animals. Let's face it, conventional animal agriculture is wreaking havoc, it occupies nearly half of the world's land, produces huge amounts of greenhouse gases and there's a potential breeding ground for health pandemics like COVID 19. With meat consumption expected to double by 2050, we urgently need solutions. ♪♪ Welcome to the next agricultural revolution. [gentle music playing] [Dr. Uma Valeti] This is the first time a meatball has ever been cooked with beef cells that did not require a cow to be slaughtered [sizzling] [waves crashing] [seagulls squawking] This has been something that I've been dreaming about since I was a kid. Thinking about the impact on human lives and animal lives and the ills of food production. It's been ten years since I finished training in cardiology at the Mayo Clinic and wanted to be able to pursue an idea of can you grow meat from animal cells and I'm extremely fortunate to have the support I have at home. My wife and kids are being proud of what I am doing. Over the last few years we spent a lot of time talking about what if your dad started this company. And if we had to move, how would it look like? It was extremely hard for us even to have the conversation because I'm a very involved dad. The last year has been determined by the amount of changes in our lives. So you know, I founded the company built an amazing team here. I quit Cardiology, operating from my home in Minnesota. I've never been away from home more than 20 days a year. In the last year, it's been like 250 days or something so. It just went up in magnitude. And I can see it only getting busier and I can see that you know, this requires that I'm under someone to focus, and passion. We just have to keep trying. Hi, Jason. Can you hear me well? [Jason] Yes, I can. And how do I sound to you? [Dr. Uma Valeti] You sound clear. [Jason] Okay, great. So let me make sure I'm pronouncing your name, right. Dr. Uma Valeti, Right? [Dr. Uma Valeti] That's correct. [Jason] How much funding did you take on? Is this venture back now or give us some idea? [Dr. Uma Valeti] So this was founded by Nick and myself and Will from Memphis and the three of us, we raised about $3.1 million. We had a venture capital group called Indy Bio that funded us. [clearing throat] [Jason] Okay, this will be an edit, so just a moment. What type of doctor are you? [Dr. Uma Valeti] I'm a cardiologist. [Jason] Okay, oh great. Let's just, let's just dive in and do this. It's my pleasure to welcome Dr Uma Valeti. He is CEO of Memphis Meats. So Uma, lab grown meat brings to mind Frankenfood, playing with nature. All of this kind of stuff take us through the process of how you grow meat in your labs. [Dr. Uma Valeti] Yes, so let me just preface this by saying we are not calling this lab grown meat because there is confusion out there that 'are you making this from plant proteins?' 'Are you synthesizing something?' What is this? This is authentic meat. [Jason] But when you say it's authentic meat I just beg to differ with you, maybe. Just correct me if I'm wrong you are engineering it. It's not. It's not completely natural, if you will? [Dr. Uma Valeti] So we take cells from whether it's a cow, a pig or a chicken then we provide them with rich nutrients these cells grow and become meat tissue. So that's the process of making the meat and... [Jason] Okay, okay. But I want you to explain what's happening here. I mean, are you basically cloning meat? Right? Is that what you're doing? [Dr. Uma Valeti] So we are not cloning anything. We are growing these cells. So these cells are growing and becoming muscle tissue. Look, we are pioneers in this area. We're starting this on the commercial side, [Jason] But, it's so funny, like you have to change your thinking and your vocabulary to even discuss the subject. It's just such an odd new concept This is a real mind blower. This is a huge shift. I would like to be an investor because I have a feeling this might be one of the biggest ideas in the history of the world. [gentle piano music playing] [Dr. Uma Valeti] So we literally moved into the space about four and a half weeks ago. You know it will take another four to six weeks to get this place up and running and that creates a sense of restlessness in me and Nick and you know everybody on our team because, you know we want to get going like yesterday [gentle piano music continuing] I know eventually the speed at which we can come to the market is going to be a function of funding and I think it's our goal to keep printing when we can, take brief periods of rest and then start printing again. So operations update. Right? This is the key for us. The focus for April will be for all of us is to get up and running. And I'm thinking we should look at the farm, the large equipment or the small equipment, and you know what you have in terms of timelines for those. There will be lots of, you know, challenges we have. Of course, there are challenges. It's never been done in the history of the world. But I think we are taking the first step and I think this first step is going to have lots and lots of people also join us in that step and we feel like we're going to kick start a revolution. [footsteps] [office chatter] I have always had an interest in my social justice issues, environmental justice issues. Pretty much my whole life all I wanted to do was be a chef and I wanted to focus on meat. About half way through college and I was like, no more basketball. I need a career. I love science, I always have. What I get really excited about is engineering biology. So my training is in biomedical engineering. I was actually a tissue engineer. I learned about some of the animal welfare implications of animal agriculture, and that was kind of what did it for me. I learned a lot about factory farming and the conditions that animals are kept in. The impact it has on the environment that I just had no idea about. I took an urban agriculture class that really opened my eyes to what we were doing to the planet just by feeding ourselves At first, I actually thought it was kind of strange because I had been very ingrained in the medical applications, and then I started reading more about it. Uma Valeti wanders across my Facebook feed with a meatball. My brain exploded and I was like, 'I have to talk to these people'. Yeah, it's like I got to be a part of this. Like I have the skills. Assert yourself and it will happen. Basically. Pretty much. [all laughing] I thought this could be a really great way to change the world and incorporate my love of science, but also my desire to make cool stuff. That's kind of my story of way, why and how I got here. [Matthew Leung] So these are the samples of live tissue. Billions of cells in this tiny portion right here. These ones are called punch biopsies, where a large needle essentially is inserted in the animal and takes out a small cylinder of tissue. The taste, texture and flavor of meat is a combination of manufacturers. It's not just muscle cells, it's fats. It's connective tissues. It's all sorts of things. And we're taking those small samples of meat or tissue apart so we can better understand the different components and use that to build our product. These are very precious biological samples which are going to give us huge insights into the biology of the animals. And these are stem cells sources for future products. These small tissue samples will produce extremely large amounts of meat. Traditionally in tissue culture, one of the elements of the food that you're giving the cells is fetal bovine serum. If you start with fetal calf serum, essentially, you're starting with this perfect rich broth of awesome stuff that is designed to make things grow and thrive. But one of the scientific goals of the company right now is to eliminate any animal derived product from our process as soon as possible. We want to separate the animal from meat making. To develop a consistent media with no animal derived components in which our cells could thrive at a large scale. That would definitely be a... really great moment for our company. It would probably be a while before we announced that that had happened. because you want there to be a lot of internal validation. [liquid bubbling] There are all these systems that animals have been building up through millions of years of evolution and that includes a digestive system and an immune system. So in some ways, cellular agriculture is more simple because you're just focusing on this one part of the animal. Instead of saying, you know, all I want is the Tenderloin. But I have to grow the liver, too but it's also a little bit more complicated because you need to engineer these systems to protect the cells. And you know, engineer sounds like a big word, but it's just like figuring out what's the best fence to keep the cow in but keep the wolf out? except kind of in a more a, more modern environment. It's what's the best fence to keep the bacteria out of our cells but keep the cells healthy without using antibiotics because that's a major concern with current animal agriculture. The whole goal here is to make cells exist in a bioreactor. So it's like what you would grow yeast in if you were making beer. So we're going to take cells and put them in an artificial environment so that they can grow and proliferate. [lab machinery whirring in background] There are known ways of producing animal muscle in a laboratory. The science is established and lots of people have studied it. What we're looking at is chicken, the sort of structure, the typical structure of chicken. I am still blown away by how complex the tissue itself is. All poultry is very similar and these are very early in the process, so they haven't completed anything yet. But you can see it's starting to adopt this sort of... it looks like a Van Gogh like "Starry Night". The muscle fibers are trying to align and form these beautiful tendrils. This is a huge, huge paradigm shift. This meat production depends on the division cycle of the cell rather than the reproductive cycle of the animal. [device beeping] This was a goal that for many years I sought out, but there were no like-minded individuals or resources to support this goal. Uma was very passionate, and we both took a leap of faith and decided to start a company. And use our complimentary areas of expertise. You know his business in administrative expertise and my scientific expertise driven by the same mission, the same motivation. You know, personally growing up in a family farm, I would raise the animals and they looked up to me for their care and their protection. I was their guardian. And as their guardian, I sent them to auction... I sent them to auction, and I sent them to slaughter. And this... after doing this for a couple of years, I realized this is a problem. So I wanted to be part of that solution. So this is a conventional beef from a local store to compare against our product. [meat sizzling] We want to make sure that whatever we're giving to consumers is the same as what they're used to. And when they get it in their hands that it will behave just the same. And so I am today looking at cooking loss. I want to make sure that the moisture loss is the same. Fat loss is the same. It needs to behave like functionally as close as possible. Going up to puncture it. - I guess that's why-- - [Dr. Uma Valeti] I got 185 on this, so... [Dr. Uma Valeti] The meat industry knows that they can't meet the demand of the people And if the demand for meat is going to double by 2050, there is just no method of production that they have at their disposal now that will satisfy that hunger for meat. There just isn't. [fast piano music playing] [fast piano music continuing] [fast piano music continuing] [fast piano music continuing] [restaurant customers bantering] [cameras shuttering] [Director] Uma would you just take your hands and clap them in front of your face like that? - Okay, everybody's standing? - [Cameraman] Yup. [Director] Okay. Any time, Uma. [Dr. Uma Valeti] So March 14th, 2017. That is today, team. We are here to do something that has never happened in the history of humanity. [Dr. Uma Valeti] Thank you, guys. Thank you for being here. [Director] Here we go! Ready? Let's rock! Whenever you're ready. [Announcer] All right, are we ready for the cook off? [meat sizzling] [Director] What's that? [Chef 1] Right there? You see that? [Director] Who touched that? [Director] Let's just get the ingredients shouted out if you would? [Dr. Uma Valeti] In terms of technical breakthroughs that allowed us to do what we did over the last year we had a few substantial, isolated breakthroughs, so one of the things that was more relevant to the poultry is starting to have texture, because the meatball, there was a texture, but not the types of texture we had with poultry, where we could have very clearly fibers that you could see in there. Fiberosity starting to have three-dimensional nature to the meat that we're producing. [all cheers-ing] [clapping] [joyful laughing] [progressive music playing] [Dr. Uma Valeti] August 23rd, 2017 we announced the closing of a major round of financing [progressive music continuing] We were able to put together a group of investors that really care about what we're doing, and it includes impact investors, but it also includes the meat industry incumbents. [progressive music continuing] [Spokesman] So it's all about sustainability. It's about, call it "clean meat", if you will? It's not going to replace the consumption of beef or chicken or duck overnight but nonetheless it's a way to produce meat in a different alternative that isn't as resource intensive. [Newscaster] Memphis Meats has raised a total of $22 million which signals a commitment to the "clean meat" movement. Which other companies are working on as well, including Tyson, which is one of the largest chicken suppliers in the United States. [progressive music continuing] So here we are in the epicenter of venture capital. We have invested about $4 billion. Companies like Skype, Hotmail, Baidu, Tesla, Twitter, Twilio. [laughing] There's a long list we've had, I think 28 companies that have exited with over $1 billion valuation and certainly food is a huge area, certainly a big market, and there's a lot of change going on with technologies with respect to the production and distribution of food. And then there are also changing consumer behaviors and changing consumer taste. And Memphis was really special The timing felt right. So we, you know, DFJ led the series. Memphis Meats was in the enviable position of having more money coming at it than it wanted to take. So it was an interesting dance to... For example consider, do you want strategic investors? So investors who themselves are in the meat industry. What are the pros and cons of that? What would that say about us? What kind of restrictions might they put on us in order to do that? So, you know, we ultimately ended up with both Tyson's and Cargill as investors, and they've been wonderful partners. And they've been really helpful in various ways, such as understanding some of the regulatory environment. [progressive music playing] [power drill whirring] Hey. [office workers bantering] [progressive music continuing] [office workers bantering] I don't think 110 pounds of dry ice is going to be enough. Now we just gotta move them. We currently occupy about this much space. - Yeah. - We're getting this much space which is 17,500 square feet. We have these two rooms that are functional cold rooms. And then the process development space over here, where we define the right conditions to grow the cells into functional meat tissues all of that space is here and then leads right into the kitchen space. [progressive music continuing] [crane motor whirring] We're going to build up the process to allow us to make scalable large quantities of meat. We can do this at small scale now, but to scale that up is going to be one of the really, really big challenges. Yeah, if you just wanna throw it in that small room... The scale for food production, the more we dig into this and think about it, it's unfathomable. It's so large. And so, I have this analogy that I say, if San Francisco is roughly a million people and if every person had one burger a week, which is like a quarter of a pound, then in a month they would each eat a pound, which is 12 million pounds a year. And so to feed everyone in San Francisco, one burger a week, 12 million pounds a year, if we make meat 50 weeks a year, that's two 240,000 pounds every week, which is approximately the size of a blue whale. And so every week, week after week after week, for San Francisco, it's a blue whale. [office workers bantering] Anyone have a marker, or a Sharpie? - All right, here. - We want our present. - You want your present? - A housewarming gift. All right, let me get the gift. One of the most important milestones you guys have, at least one of the ways we think about it, is price per pound, which is kind of a singular thing that over time, presumably, will continue to go down. So I went home last night and I made you this little sign as an office warming gift. So it's like a little old grocery store sign and it says "Memphis Meats, today's price". [all clapping] And it's out of glass, because this is my hobby, I make glass. So you want to write in todays' price? - Go ahead, Nick. - Do it. [Nick] Do we need to consult on this? - [Man 2] No, Go for it. - [Woman 5] Go for it! [Woman 5] See if it matches what I saw in the deck yesterday [laughing] All right, just a little ways to go [laughing] We had a couple of extra 0's next to it when we started. [Woman 5] I know, I know, this is already progress. Maybe three zeros next to it. Like I said, if we keep on at the same rate, we'll be there in no time. [Dr. Uma Valeti] Okay, so February 16th, 2018. The last harvest of meat at Memphis Meats was $1,700 a pound - That was beef. - Beef. Yes, yes. [champagne bottle popping] [team cheering] Day one in the new building is always extra exciting. [team cheering & clapping] [champagne bottle popping] I'm filled with gratitude. I've always said I'm here because of my family Then it started up with Nick and I joining here. Now, this is our extended family, and I want to really thank you very much. I raise a glass for better meat, better world. Cheers. [all "Cheers!"] [ambient music playing] [Dr. Parvataneni] I haven't been here since 2012. [Dr. Uma Valeti] Yeah, we've been in this business for a very long time. [Dr. Parvataneni] I mean this company's so diverse. You were still practicing as a cardiologist then. [laughing] [Dr. Parvataneni] That seems like eons ago. [mobile phone ringing] [Dr. Uma Valeti] Hello? [speaking Hindi] [speaking Hindi] [Dr. Parvataneni] Uma's talked about this idea of growing meat for as long as I've known him which is almost 25 years. He's talked about this in some form or another. It's among the values that we talk about as a family. [speaking Hindi] - [Dr. Parvataneni] Mm, thanks. - [Dr. Uma Valeti] Yeah. [partygoers bantering] [all speaking Hindi] [Dr. Parvataneni] He spent a lot of time thinking about it and one thing you know is that when you have a desire like that, it doesn't go away with ignoring it. It only grows, especially when you know it's meant to be [camera shuttering] [Dr. Uma Valeti] The only process that we are changing is one step. Instead of these cells growing in an animal, we are growing them outside the animal. Meat is still the same meat, and we're harvesting it. [mobile device beeping] [Dr. Uma Valeti] The idea was to go to the U.S. wanting to do cardiology and cardiac surgery at Mayo, and I had a number of interviews at Mayo Clinic but my visa got rejected multiple times. So, back then when your visa was rejected, you could try, I think three times in total. And I believe I got rejected three times. [Dr. Parvateneni] Any reason why they give you? Why they rejected you? No, I mean, it was hard to know. I think I went well prepared. [Dr. Parvateneni] Okay. But it was all over in a few seconds and there was really no explanation. So it was at that time I thought the world was turned upside down and it was a shade of shock because I pretty much thought this is where I would train. But then you go into solutions more than they decided that I would go to Jamaica and work there for a while and reapply to go to the U.S. to train again. So that started my journey to leave India. But... If I didn't get those rejections, I wouldn't have gone to Jamaica. And if I didn't go there, I wouldn't have met my wife [Dr. Parvateneni] Oh, can you tell me the moment when it took that big leap of faith? You know, your journey from cardiology to business? [Dr. Uma Valeti] As I started working in cardiology at the Mayo Clinic That's when stem cell research was really being worked on to grow heart muscle and I started to think about how could we translate the benefits of stem cells into treating disease and later on in my practice, I was injecting stem cells into patients' hearts do regrow heart muscle, and that's where the idea came from. I started thinking about if I practice cardiology for another 30 years I would probably save two or three thousand lives, But there is very little in the form of any idea that even comes close to the level of impact of what this could be impact on billions of human lives and trillions of animal lives. And it felt like it was not even close to the choice of me continuing cardiology. Although it was enormously satisfying. I felt good about leaving cardiology and starting something that had a transformative impact. [ambient music playing] [Dr. Uma Valeti] I would say coming to India it feels like connecting back with the roots of where the idea came from. [ambient music continuing] [Dr. Uma Valeti] When I was twelve years old, there was a party for one of my friends in this neighborhood. There was a birthday party. There was a lot of people. He was like dancing, and there was a lot of food and I just happened to walk to the back of the home where they were making the food where I saw the animals, chickens, being slaughtered. It was an experience where I saw intense and, you know, true happiness in the front of the home where they were celebrating my friend's birthday. And then I walked back. And then there was this moment where that happiness is being supported by ending life, and that was very hard for me and... It was just this feeling in me that how, as humans, we were incredibly capable of having a lot of joy, fun, generosity. And on the other side, there was this dark reality of you know, ending life. There was a birthday on one side and there was a death day on the other side. and it was happening at the same time. Obviously, as a kid, I thought, Why don't we all stop eating meat? And that is a solution that is on the table always. [Indian music playing] [Dr. Uma Valeti] What I thought I would do today is talk to you about the stages in my life. I want to talk about the four kilometer circle I grew up in. But some of the things that happened in my life, the experiences and the stories that shaped who I am, I'm going to talk about my progression from being a kid walking the streets here to what brings me back here today. [Students bantering] [speaking Hindi] [Indian music continuing] [audience applauding] [speaking Hindi] [Presenter 2] What I want is, out of 1,200 students, if two people get ignited and if two people reach the level of Shaker where he is that wonderful. That is our wish. [audience applauding] [Dr. Uma Valeti] Okay. Can you hear me okay? Thank you very much for having me. I feel like I'm still a 16-year-old seeing all of you in this room. So I want to talk to you guys. Vijayawada has autonomous schools. So we had to run our own cafeterias. Then we would go to the market shopping for, you know, a thousand kids and I saw a large scale slaughter. So when you see large scale slaughter like that that's automated on machines like in a few seconds, you know, hundreds of lives are taken. It was hard for me to understand how we could allow some things like that which at that point is when I said, okay, I am going to stop eating meat. But I love the taste of meat. It's not something that you want to give up easily, but it was one of those things I said, Well, let's just stop and I used to dream at that point, about, meat growing on trees, but that was pretty unusual to dream about meat trees. 50 years from now people will look back and say, My gosh, you had to raise billions of animals, kill them to get meat to the table. Why could you not just grown it directly? So the implications are massive. I know. I've spoken for about 30 - 40 minutes. I want to kind of bring us back in the full circle back to this colony. I grew up in front of this building my entire life before I left Vijayawada I was in a four kilometer radius in this colony with a number of people that I finally remember as people that I depended on it's the relationships around me that made me pull through. My family, my friends, my teachers, my neighbors. Thank you again for having me. I'm happy to take some questions. [audience applauding] - Hey. - Hey. [Dr. Uma Valeti] Oh, Auntie Alanaru. Oh, I'm so happy to see you. Thank you. [speaking Hindi] Yeah, so nice to see you. Thanks for coming. [speaking Hindi] What? Do you want me to write on this, mom? [helicopter blades whirring] [bongo music playing] [police sirens sounding] [bongo music continuing] [Jessica Almy] The U.S. Cattleman's Association filed a petition with the U.S. Department of Agriculture asking for the USDA to change its policy book to define meat and beef in ways that make it impossible for clean meat to use those terms on their labels. [bongo music continuing] Usually, when consumers pick up a package of beef in the grocery store, they expect it to be from the flesh of an animal harvested in the traditional manner. [bongo music continuing] If you have these other products floating around on shelves and potentially being co-mingled with our products we see not only food safety concerns but obviously consumer's rights issues, because, everybody deserves to know where their food comes from. it should be more along the lines of alternative protein or, you know, specifying that it's coming from a muscular tissue sample. now is a make or break moment for clean meat. Is it going to be FDA or is it going to be USDA and whichever agency it is is it going to be a reasonable process for coming to market? [bongo music continuing] [Dr. Uma Valeti] So we started talking to the Meat Institute. [bongo music continuing] And on August 23rd, 2018 we wrote a letter to the president. [bongo music continuing] The letter was a culmination of lots of discussions. It took a lot of back and forth conversations. [slow music playing] [Dr. Uma Valeti] We, you know, we wouldn't have even dreamed of this a year ago or two years ago. I think the moment felt very surreal. And I also saw... enormous amounts of, you know, conflict within me. I can't imagine I am signing a letter with the largest meat trade association in the world. Felt like the right thing to do and this is signing my name behind it and saying we are going to truly bring everybody under this tent in saying this is a solution that the world is looking forward to. [Researcher] Using markets and food technology to solve problems? That's not a left or a right issue. There should be governments, there should be massive foundations, there should be billion dollar philanthropists. We need Manhattan projects. We need moon landings. We need absolute commitment to making this happen as quickly as possible. [typing intently] [computer mouse clicking] It is just true that the vast majority of people are not going to incorporate ethical considerations into their dietary choices So let's take ethics off the table and let's just create products that people want to buy because they are delicious they are reasonably priced and they are everywhere. So that's, you know, the brainstorm and the focus GFI. One of the things that GFI does is thinks about consumer acceptance issues and we just had so many people who would hear cultured meat and they would just sort of recoil. And obviously lab grown meat is even worse. In-vitro meat is even worse. And so we surveyed everybody in sort of the community of clean meet at the beginning of 2016. We said, what do you think? You know what should we call it? And the results came back and clean meat was about, led to about 20% greater consumer acceptance than cultured meat. [typing intently] We can eliminate industrial animal agriculture in the next 20 - 30 years. The best way to do that, it's markets, it's food technology, it's creating products that people actually want to buy that they can afford and that they can find. [marketgoers chattering] [suspenseful music playing] Hello! Hello. [microphone feedback] Hello, everyone. [Crowd] Hello. Welcome to the first annual Good Food Conference. [audience applauding] [suspenseful music continuing] [Man] Hey, hey Uma. How are you? Good to see you. [Dr. Uma Valeti] The last time we met you were moving faster. What do you call this? Our hometown. - [Dr. Uma Valeti] Our hometown. - [Man] Yes. So we started to think about making a hamburger from stem cells or making meat from stem cells in 2004. Funded by the Dutch government we could start those technologies, develop those technologies. Unveiling of that first hamburger was in August 2013 in London. We got the money for that from Sergei Brynn who put something like $1.5 million in it. We made three hamburgers for that money. What I knew is this is a big societal problem, and this is a potential solution for that societal problem. What we had experienced, of course, in the project was yes, there was media attention for it, but there was not a whole lot of public interest for it. Actually the trigger for the whole thing was the story of William Van Eelen at that time already 86 and who basically was so enthusiastic about this project and really wanted us to do this. [Ira Van Eelen] Pan it to me too. [Photographer] Will do. [Dr. Uma Valeti] I'm really honored to meet you and you know your dad's work has inspired me while I was in training in cardiology. I was about fourteen when he started working on this. And that's 40 years ago now. and where there was a handful of people that you could talk to and to be here now was about 450 people in a sold out conference. And everybody knowing what clean meat is, is for me like, a very weird situation. [Dr. Uma Valeti] In many ways, your dad's kind of stimulated an entire generation of thinking. [Ira Van Eelen] Yes, he did. You don't have to be a scientist. You have to have conviction on your vision. And I think he's kind of sewing the seeds for all of us to kind of stand on his shoulders. He wrote the patent and he got funded. And then, of course, Mark took over the torch which was good. I am the daughter of William Van Eelen. He's considered the great grandfather of clean meat. In 2010 I organized the first ever clean meat, or at that time was called Pure Meat Conference in Nemo Technical Museum in Amsterdam. And there we got the first footage of very small slivers of pig meat that Mark Post had made. And that was the first ever pictures of actual clean meat, and they went into the media and that is actually how the investors of Sergey Brin found Mark Post. So this is a story full of domino tiles. [Reporter] Tell me you are kind of the rock star here. You have been described to me as a rock star. You and Mark Post, people are so interested in Memphis Meats, you've got all these investors Why is there so much interest in your company? [Dr. Uma Valeti] Well, I'm flattered to hear what you're saying about me and Mark, but ultimately this is something that caught the imagination of, I say, every country, every continent. [Reporter] Cell based Sounds a little scary and clean meat implies that implies the conventional meat is dirty. [Dr. Uma Valeti] Right. So the background for this, in the context of it is then we started talking about this industry and starting the company, Memphis Meats was the first company in the space. We started talking to a number of people and people uniformly got excited and they started calling the product clean meat. Clean duck, clean chicken, clean beef. Because it mainly communicated the benefits of a cleaner production environment as well as the benefits we thought we could have at scale in terms of energy savings. But as we started talking more and more about this it became particularly clear that there are people that felt like while they want this innovation to come to market, using a prefects like clean was not inclusive. Our nomenclature. Why cell based or why clean or why cultured? Or you know what are the...? Rather than saying what it is, because what it is, is meat. Isn't there a quick way to just say how it's made? When a consumer is buying it, we want them to know it's coming from animal cells. versus, a meat alternative. Why are we so fixated on having a word in front of meat? It's almost like gluten free, like you want it to be like factory farm free. [Lou] Consumers want transparency. They want you to be honest with what you're doing. So that's why I support cellular. And we want to be transparent. I don't want people mixing up with stuff with regular-- [Lou] No, but on the other hand, what we're not communicating is... we're communicating back to being too technically driven. We're communicating the process. What if the adjective is more about a global solution? [Erin Brodwin] Yeah, I'm bullish on factory farm free. #FFF. [Lou] FFF. But there's a lot of meat out there factory farm free. So you shouldn't define it by what it's not. [Dr. Uma Valeti] How's it going? [Josh Tetrick] Good. Going. [Dr. Uma Valeti] Really good? Really, busy? The alternate would be bad. So how about you? Are you travelling or? [Josh Tetrick] Uh yeah, just got back from Zuürich. When we thought about the next thing we were in 4,000 Walmarts, we were in 3,300 public schools, We were making tens of millions of dollars in sales so we easily could have done meat with plants that was there for us to take, but I couldn't imagine a world where McDonald's would replace all of their hamburgers with the plant based burger and we decided to go headlong into cultured meat. [Announcer] All right, guys, we're going to get ready here in just a second. This is a jam packed panel. I'm so excited for it. [Josh Tetrick] More people are eating meat today than yesterday and more people unfortunately will eat meat tomorrow, than today. We think it's going to be critical ultimately, to get the price of meat below the cost of conventional meat. Proof of concept has been demonstrated to the public, but now we're about proof of scale. You know, what is this factory of the future? It is a food factory. It has a lot of the similarities to any other food factory following some the same principles. And I really see this industry as being a parallel supply chain, or maybe integrated into the food system, which I like that people are starting to talk about the food ecosystem and the system that's what we're a part of. We are not a separate entity. The lowering the cost to feed is the biggest challenge in this field. And right now that's a problem because no one is producing those ingredients at scale. But as you start figuring out the key ingredients that our animal cells need to grow I have very little doubt in my mind that those things can be scaled up. [Josh Tetrick] I think the folks in the audience that are thinking about starting their own company don't just you know, look at what the folks up here on the stage you're doing think about how you could provide something to the ecosystem that could be even more valuable than what we're doing up here. [Niyati Gupta] Right. So, for example, I would imagine that if a company were to start trying to create steak, there might be another startup that would emerge that would try to produce the fat that would fit into the marbled steak. [Sarah Sorscher] From the consumer perspective, we're facing a brave new world with technology that was once the stuff of science fiction now becoming a reality. [Jack Bobo] I think it's also worth pointing out that people love innovation almost as much as they despise change. And there's no place they despise change more than in the food they eat. [Kevin Kester] Consumers have come to expect satisfaction and a high quality eating experience from real beef. The manufacturers of lab grown products should be required to invest in their own market development efforts and not ride the coattails of beef's success. [crowd bantering] [Jessica Almy] Consumers are enthusiastic about these products. We did a poll with the company Faunalytics and we found that two thirds of Americans are willing to try meat grown from cells without slaughtering animals and 40% that they would pay a premium for these products. Allowing cellular based proteins or plant based proteins to bear the label meat or beef or the USDA Federal meat inspection shield or stamp would be misleading. [Jessica Almy] Thank you. We fully recognize that debate will continue as to what these products should be called moving forward. And although we have not firmly determined what the nomenclature should be, our producers will seek a labeling regime that provides a clear separation between lab produced products and conventionally grown meat. Some terms, like fake, synthetic or artificial meat, are intended to not only cast our products in a negative light, but are also simply false and misleading. We're making real meat and seafood, and that's the whole point. The term lab grown has an accuracy problem as well. As with many familiar and currently marketed food products the early development of our products happens in food labs, but the products that we bring to consumers will be produced in food production facilities, not labs. [Jessica Almy] We really want to hear from you today. That's really what this meeting is about. Anyone else would you like to come forward and make a comment during this open comment period? We cell based food producers do need to use the terms fish and meat to reiterate if one is allergic to animal based seafood, that person has a high probability I would say almost a 100% certainty that they will be allergic to the seafood produced using our technology. We as cattle producers, we worked a long time to build trust between consumers and stuff like that. That's why I urge these companies or individuals that are doing this technology to maybe step back and educate us so we understand it. It might help us be more accepting to what you want to accomplish. Thank you. [Jessica Almy] Thank you for your comments. Would anyone else like to come forward and comment? [Isha Datar] I suspect that producing meat from animal cell culture, rather than whole animals, could result in fewer viral epidemics fewer threats to food security and fewer externalized costs to environment, public health and animal welfare. Currently, 815 million people around the globe are malnourished, as has been discussed a few times today. Hunger has been on the rise for the last three years, and this number is expected to drastically increase as the world's population grows. We must rethink the global food production system. For us producing bluefin tuna, cell based bluefin tuna, there will be no mercury, no plastic, we're not using antibiotics we are not overfishing, the ocean. We are not engaging in animal cruelty. On the question of safety innovation in the meat industry is urgently needed. Conventional methods rely on the intensive confinement of animals in unsanitary and inhumane facilities. These unnatural conditions require extensive use of antibiotics to address diseases that proliferate among the crowded, stressed animals. Contributing to the spread of drug resistant superbugs. We need real alternatives to the suffering. We need real alternatives to the cruel and inhumane conditions forced upon billions of animals we need alternatives to artificial insemination, overcrowding, genetic manipulation, long transport and slaughter. Without a clear, predictable and timely framework, this industry cannot succeed. Any delays in moving forward would jeopardize the U.S.'s standing in the world as the leader in protein production and responsible science based food innovation. [crowd bantering] [cameras shuttering] In addition to providing clarity in terms of the regulatory pathway, are there any other incentives, either through research, maybe through ARS or any other type of ways that can be implemented to help ensure that the American startups pursuing cellular agriculture products can move forward Well, the good thing about the environment, the economy and the democratic process we have here is our innovators and entrepreneurs and our risk takers are very creative in their efforts. We want to be ahead of the game. I think the regulatory framework needs to be there to provide guidance for our entrepreneurs and innovators to work towards so. we will be moving post haste after this meeting to more clearly define that. I think this is one of those unique examples where we're contemplating all these things really early in the process, really in advance of the products even being available and that's going to, I think help the innovation take root and provide really clear guidance to the manufacturers. I think it should accelerate the innovation. Thank you. [Interviewer] Would you like America to be first? [Sonny Perdue] Yes. [Eric Schulze] I've been like thinking about this for the last month, obviously in preparation. This moment where heavily vested parties and cultural identities would intersect in a formal way. Hi, you here for Eric? What little company with no product on the market gets two federal agencies to talk to each other in the most productive way? It was incredible. It is incredible. Food is regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and it's about 80% of the domestic food supply. and for the remainder it's largely under the USDA. [mobile device tapping] The U.S. food system splits into, for meat and poultry, animals that are alive, the FDA regulates and then basically from the moment of slaughter forward, the USDA regulates. [distant city cars honking] [Cab driver] This good, though? Yeah. If you want to pull up right here, that's fine. [Eric Schulze] We want to compete on market with products that are safe and labeled, and then that's where we want to be. And the way to get there at the last hurdle is the regulatory system. And that's why we're putting so much energy into it right now. [bongo music playing] [bongo music continuing] So we have jurisdiction for both FDA and USDA. You've done a fantastic job leading this effort from Memphis Meats, so... I hope you take a moment, pause, and recognize it's a big milestone. [Eric Shulze] Yeah, I think all these big moments happen and then we sort of like wait, Did it just happen? We'd have to like pinch ourselves to make sure it really happened. We finally get to this end point. So one thing I was thinking, what is next now for us? It doesn't matter how great our tech is, if we can't sell it legally, who cares? I think that the next step is one we're working on the pathway. But it could slow down. There's a possibility that pathway negotiations stall. Or if there's congressional intervention which is still lingering. We know that there's language in the approach bill. So there's a chance that this could still delay. I want to be realistic about that. There was, let's say the pathway gets slowed. At least we have a reasonable time frame of getting under the market, we can continue to do technical development, continue to lower cost, continue to increase scale and be ready for that moment. What would be motivating factors for that? Very successful lobbying against us. Okay, so safety and truthful labeling, right? Correct. Those are the two legal requirements for us. Yeah, this will be FDA. This will be USDA. [Eric Shulze] One of the big unknowns, of course, is, where inspections will be split. Labeling, we know that's going to be handled by the USDA. We know that, but we don't know how. So this is a bare bones pathway right now. USDA comes in here and the bio system we're talking about. Where's the biosystems? This is the bio system where the animal cells and the feed are growing. [Eric Shulze] They would do it as part of a pre market safety evaluation. So they'll evaluate the safety, they'd inspect it and then they would check to make sure that we're following. our inspections ourselves so they wouldn't come on site and check regularly. Okay. [Eric Shulze] That's currently what we're thinking. I think there's a lot of fear around the intersection of food and technology, and we really want to, many of us want to go sort of back to the land, and we have our own little backyard gardens and chicken coops and do it the way that you know they did in Little House on the Prairie . But that won't work to feed 9 billion - 10 billion people. And tech will have role. The question is what role? And how can you do tech right? - [Dr. Uma Valeti] Hey, David. - [David] Hey, Uma. [Dr. Uma Valeti] How are you? Good to meet you in person. How are you? Good to see you after all of this, how nice. So what's the--? Yeah, so I think in the interest of time, we should probably start heading over to the R&D facility. Should we start walking this way? [Dr. Uma Valeti] Yeah. So what we believe in is it starts with the consumers and ends with the consumers right, so they have to get behind it and we want to get this right as opposed to being first to market. First to market you know, it sounds really exciting to do but doing the most desirable product that consumers allow is what we're trying to do. - Hey guys. Good morning. - [Amanda Little] Hi. - [Casey] Hi. How are you? - [Amanda] Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you as well. Casey is our vice president of process development and has enormous experience in growing cells in very, very large quantities. I've been growing cells for a long time. and it never dawned on me to eat them, ever so, it's a little bit of a shift, but it's so exciting because the things that we've been learning for decades all totally apply. This is the brew? This is the special broth? [Dr. Uma Valeti] It's a superfood. This is a superfood, a cellular superfood, and it's a nice lavender... [Dr. Uma Valeti] Time to walk over to the next spot. Let's do that in a little bit. [David] You know maybe we should actually do that now. [Dr. Uma Valeti] Let's just walk over there. Thank goodness, David. Keeping our ass on time. You know I'm really showing restraint. I have a lot of other questions. This lab is just being set up now there will be a lot of automation units in there. There is some there are liquid handling robots that means They're handling the feed that Casey is working with. [Amanda Little] Did you say liquid handling robots? [Dr. Uma Valeti] Take you around and when we first started, we were only producing very small quantities where, you know, you can make them evolve now. Since then, we can pretty much grow as much as we need for our tasting and testing purposes, so we can do several pounds of meat production and testing at this point, but the goal is to be able to take and we scale up to a few thousand pounds. [meat sizzling] [Chef] There we go. Trying to get it nice and seared. [meat sizzling] Let's see if you want to just quickly-- This feels about as low risk a food as I have ever eaten. Even if I just signed a high risk agreement. [Amanda laughing] You're not eating anything that I am not eating so you're eating meat that comes from cells from a very high quality animal. This this is still a early stage product, but I think I just want to make sure you're looking at this as a very big, historic thing in this world. So I'm anxious to see what you think about it. See it's really, you know, see all the fibers in there? See the browning of the skin? And as you pull apart, you know meat's hard to pull apart because it's got those features and those proteins and the elasticity which is... That is meat. [Uma laughing] That is duck meat. It's delicious! It's got all the stringiness of the strands of muscle which is something you don't get in plant based meats, of course. And you don't get that resistance with the chew resistance. I mean, the chew is, it's very chewy. [Dr. Uma Valeti] Yes. [Amanda Little] Very, it's very meaty. Wow, amazing. We don't take a very long time to grow meat, right? So if you have to think about a cow from conception all the way to slaughter at the age of 18 to 24 months, the whole process is about two and a half years. For us to grow beef, if it takes about four weeks, at the most six weeks. So tell me about your inputs. I mean, this gets to the bovine growth room and also the environmental implications, right? Yeah, yeah. So in the early parts of research in this area, the supply chain includes serum. And when we think about scaling this up, we cannot have a supply chain that is going to have serum. That's why we want to separate out serum from meat production. or blood from meat production and have our own feed for it. So that's the process we are working out and we've developed a full end to end method of growing cells without any serum at all. For us to put products on the market completely animal free. It's going to take a while. There are still parts of our research that depends on getting that serum in to understand how the cells grow. Yeah, I guess what I'm wondering so for the carbohydrates, for example, like are you actually using some kind of carbohydrate source? You know, for example, some grain or I mean, are there actual sort of recognizable ingredients that go into the production? 100%. They're all recognizable. They are already in the current feed system. It's still proprietary of what kinds of feeds that we are using because we're trying to break it down and saying, okay, what is the most efficient source of like carbohydrate feed? [Amanda Little] So it might be some crop that we recognize? - Right. Yeah, yeah. 100%. - [Amanda] Okay. Okay. So it's, you know, maybe it might include some amount of corn or soy or something? I just want to address that this as an important point. It doesn't mean that we're going to stop growing corn just because we stopped stopped growing cows? - Right. There are estimates of 40 - 50% of land being used to grow crops to feed animals. We'll still need crops like you said, but it's not even close to the degree that we need for keeping, you know, a very, very large herd of 70 billion animals on this planet. Keep in mind you're seeing very small scale production at this point, and as we start thinking about scaling this up, one of the big areas of innovation that we'll start seeing is decreasing the environmental impact, decreasing the environmental footprint. It also makes me feel like that is the reason we are here, to solve this problem. - It keeps us going. - Biomemesis right? You're listening and learning from the animal. [Dr. Uma Valeti] There is a pretty intense need to innovate how we produce food. [atmospheric music playing] [machine engine chugging] [atmospheric music continuing] [Dr. Uma Valeti] Almost everything we are doing in terms of innovation is to do more with less and that's really foundational to all the conversations in climate are happening. [atmospheric music continuing] [Dr. Uma Valeti] I mean, for instance, our idea is to be able to grow more food, more nutrient dense food, with less resources to get a pound of meat. [atmospheric music continuing] [Dr. Uma Valeti] Our target is to be able to say we could use almost ten times less land, almost ten times less water and less deforestation. And all of these have a direct impact on climate, the amount of CO2 that is released. [atmospheric music continuing] [Dr. Uma Valeti] There is no methane production when you're growing cells. When you culture cells, the cells are basically, it's an oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange that's happening. Methane doesn't come into the picture, so we don't expect to have methane in our production process as we scale up. [atmospheric music continuing] [house dog barking] So I'm going to make some pancakes for breakfast? - [Uma] Okay. - [Mrs. Valeti] Is that good? Blueberries? I have some blueberries and blackberries. [Mrs. Valeti] Do you want coffee? [Dr. Uma Valeti] Sure. Yeah. Do you have the decaf? [Mrs. Valeti] Sure. [Dr. Uma Valeti] Bananas? - [Mrs. Valeti] I'll cut them. - [Dr. Uma Valeti] Okay. That's coming out nicely, too. So this is from... [Mrs. Valeti] So I'm leaving on Sunday to Minneapolis. [Dr. Uma Valeti] Okay. Yeah. [Mrs. Valeti] So you have a lot of late meetings this week? [Dr. Uma Valeti] Yeah. [Mrs. Valeti] Can you not do that next week, please? Make sure that the kids get home at a decent hour so that you can spend some time with the kids in the evening? Yeah. I actually told Jerry to have me out every day by 5:30 or 6:00. So I should be home pretty early. When I had moved to the Bay Area, of course, my family was still living in Minnesota and the kids were going to school there. [Mrs. Valeti] Thank you for making breakfast. Mrunalini had her pediatric practice there. And it was not easy. But ultimately being able to move the family here and just being able to talk to them every day. Seeing them, I think has completely changed my life. Just having the opportunity for us all to as a family spend time under one roof as we are going after this very big idea in this world, I'm just very grateful. I actually brought some markup boxes of our what packaging could look like. [Mrs. Valeti] Is it gonna be like vacuum? Like you know? That sealed thing so you can...? Yeah. So people can see what they're buying. And this is the beef. [Mrs. Valeti] I like it. I like this "made with love in California". When I think about the why of what we're doing, it's not a product. It's much more than that. It's about the way that we want the future world to look and that's what drives and motivates Uma every day. He has two hats going at all times. It's the what? Like, what will it look like? But the why and the how? The ingredients it says cell based are grown from cells and salt, spices. [Mrs. Valeti] Yeah. That's what it says here, chicken, cell based sea salt, spices including chipotle pepper. And same thing here. Of course. Right. We need to get labeling approved and all of the materials approved. But this is what we're thinking. We've got to be open to innovation and open to conversations, but also keep the focus on which particular one will we bring forward at the next step. Knowing that this is not a race, it's not going to be a one and done and that we'll be doing it in sequence. So our focus is entirely on scale. Like we've got to produce it at a scale that is meaningful. [crowd bantering] This is just about 70,000 square feet, rentable space here. [Dr. Uma Valeti] So this is a 70,000 foot print. And the height is-- [Steve Myrick] It will easily cost us tens of millions of dollars to get this first production facility up and running. The goal is not just to make the meat in this facility, but also to have it be a showcase for future facilities and for partners who can join us and build out their own production capacity in their facilities using their capital. So it serves a lot of purposes beyond just the meat but it will not come cheap. It's a really heavy lift that we're taking on here. There's a service elevator that we'll take down that gives you access back down to the ground floor. [Casey] And if I wanted a fireman's pole? [laughing] [Dr. Uma Valeti] These are high ceilings. [Casey] Yeah, so this is a lot bigger. Oh nice, this I more than 24 feet it looks like. Or maybe it's 24. Yeah, so this is 20,000 square feet here where you can do the manufacturing operations. [Dr. Uma Valeti] Okay. So you could have a flow of basically follow the process from an area with your raw materials, your media preparation provide all the nutrients for the cells back into the bio processing suite, harvest and then to the food formulation space. So you can follow a a U shaped thing here for the process all the way around. It could be really nice. Our paradigm for production will continue to evolve. But this is this seems like the most accessible, relevant next step for translating from R&D. [Casey] It's a launching pad. Yes, it's a launching pad. It's transformative. Having it all right here, locally sourced and being able to put it out Locally sourced, locally produced, locally distributed. How's that? [Casey] Yeah, amazing. That's what you're going to be making right? [Casey] I'm working on it. I'm working on it. I think it has the potential to also be that transparent venue where people can really understand how we're making meat. There were times where Nick and I in the first six months of the company looked at each other and said I don't know if anyone will believe us. And if we can actually take this to a stage where we can scale it to producing meaningful amounts of meat and you know, Nick said in one of those tough moments, "we've got to have faith". I still remember that day because it was one of my lowest moments because it was challenging to get people to recognize it, it was impossible for people to understand that this needed a chance. [atmospheric music playing] [Jane Goodall] The birth of this game changing industry is no longer science fiction, it's reality. The innovation of cell cultured meat, poultry, fish and seafood is accelerating quickly around the globe with pioneers on every continent. Our shared humanity depends on this hopeful and rapid momentum towards a sustainable future for us, the animals and for our beautiful planet Earth.

This is what Winston Churchill was talking about in 1931. I actually remember that exact quote. "We shall escape the absurdity of growing a whole chicken in order to eat the breast or wing, by growing these parts separately under a suitable medium." That's exactly what we all did. All right.
