My daughter Sonia, really likes your horse. She is pestering, since yesterday. That she wants this horse. But, this... I know you must have raised him with love. If you don't mind, I will pay the price of your wish for this. Mr. Modi. The thing raised with love, is given with love only. Not with money. I would have said no to you. But this child is like my grandson. For her happiness, take it as a gift from me. Grandmother, grandmother. Dildara is not there. Who freed him? Tell me, grandmother. Grandmother. Grandmother. Where did Dildara go? I gave him away. No! Dildara...! [VOICE ECHOING] Dildara...! [VOICE ECHOING] Dildara, Where were you Dildara? Jai.

What is it? Mr. PyareSingh is here, to bow infront of grandfather's picture. Just take care. He will surely break something, on his way back. Why are you disturbing mother? Hey Pyare, till when will you keep bowing infront of him? Till my last breath, mother. Commissioner sir was the one who gave me employment. Otherwise, who might have made a stupid person like me a sub inspector? I have my meals because of him only. Just. He is my God. Why do you make his soul unhappy? I just know, that commissioner sir is my only God. OK, mother. I will leave now. [GLASS SHATTERS] Aah…! You be damned. See, you broke it. [APPLAUSE] Now, I will request the minister. To start distributing the B. Com degree. [APPLAUSE] Miss. IndraniVajpeyi. University first. [APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE] Zakir Hussain. [APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE] Jai Singh.

Or we will change the government. ALL: Yes, yes. We will change… Jai. Don't spoil the event. You keep quiet, govt.'s pet. Your job was decided even before you were born. ALL: Beat them. Beat them. Silence! ALL: Beat them. Beat them. [CHAOTIC NOISE] Sir. These, these tomatoes are sour. Oh, shut up! [CHAOTIC NOISE] [CHUCKLES] They were showing off. [LAUGHTER] They must have got the lesson.

[INDISTINCT] [INDISTINCT] [INDISTINCT] [SIREN WAILING] [THUNDERING CLOUDS] Who were they? I don't know, inspector. They had masks on their face. Sir, sir I think, they were Desraj and his friends. No, sir. It was not them. Then, who might they be? They may be someone from outside. You mean, terrorists? - Possible. - Hhmm. [THUNDER CRACKING] Cheers! Jai. Desraj and his friends, have beaten Naresh to the point that he has become unconscious. Come along with me. [THUNDER CRACKING] Where is idiot, Desraj? He, he has not yet returned. [THUNDER RUMBLING] [SHOUTS] Son, come out. Jai, look. This will lead to chaos. If it will happen. [GRUNTS] [GLASS BREAKAGE] Remember, Never in life try to be stubborn with Jai.

The thing is… Yes, there was an event in the college, grandmother. It might had been over by evening. Then, there was dinner, grandmother. That must have ended by 9. Then, there was drama. Drama, was a bit long. And interesting too, grandmother. I know everything… What more do you know? That, you come late daily. And just make such excuses. Your, waking up late in the morning, and wasting time with friends. Is something, I don't like at all. Till the time, you won't improve your habits. How will you get a job? Grandmother, if by waking up early one gets a job. Then, do wake me up early from tomorrow. Okay. I will also see, how waking up early helps me get a job. If you don't wake up, then remember. I will throw a vessel of cold water on you. OK, Okay. Throw it on me. [ROOSTER CROWING] Hare Rama, Hare Krishna. Jai! So, Jai! See, the sun is here. Today I will surely throw water on his face. He promises at night, and in the morning… [INDISTINCT CHATTERS] [INDISTINCT CHATTERS] Waiter. HeyPyare, come here. Bring one dozen of boiled eggs on credit. It's not permitted, sir. - Whose permission, Pyare? - Mine. The thing is. That the last Rs. 625, remains unpaid from one month. The thing is. Now I will not give credit. Nor, I want my hotel to close down. The thing is. The first rule of success in a business. Is credit. If you won't give credit, Then how will you do the business, Mr. Phokat Lal? - I was… joking. - Hmm. Hhmm. The hotel is of your own. Eat to your heart's desire. And make good health. - Mr Phokat Lal. - Yes. For his victory. Let's play a dare today. I won't play dare. The thing is. You all always, make a fool of me and run away. Mr Phokat Lal, if you try today. You may win this dare. See, both the glasses. Without touching them with anything. You need to separate them from one another. This dare is for Rs. 500. Hhmm. Hhmm. The thing is. You separate them. I will play for Rs. 1000, yes. Hhmm. [APPLAUSE] Grandmother. So, mother. What should we do of him? I don't know anything. My forehead is burning since yesterday night. Does he even care for me? [COUGHING] Grandmother, grandmother. Till when shall I endure? Wherever I go, people only blame me. As if I am the one to spoil him. I know people don't say anything. This, PyareSingh sitting here. He keeps on gossiping about me. You, like him. He is my spy. When did I spy on you? Tell me? You threw eggs and tomatoes on the minister. Did I tell mother? What? Threw eggs and tomatoes? Yes, mother. And that too sour. You created a ruckus in the university. Broke so many chairs. Did I tell mother? Broke the chairs? Not just the chairs, mother. He went into Desraj's hostel and broke his bones. Ask, did I tell mother? - Whose bones did you broke? - Desraj's. And not just this mother. He sits with his friends and plays cards. Drink's beer, smokes cigarettes. As? Did I tell mother? What? Drink's beer? Smoke's cigarette? This is my good nature. That I have hidden all your actions from mother. That's it. You have told everything. Now, what remains? Why are you scolding him? Talk to me. Is this what you do? Do you know anything apart from anger, hatred and stubbornness? Remember this, all these are the paths to hell. I don't know, where is heaven. But I know for sure that love makes life beautiful. Hey. Being unemployed doesn't mean that you lose all the love from your heart. If I am not getting a job, then what can I do? Look at his anger. As if he earns in thousands. Hey, does the whole world earn through jobs only? Business is also there. Which business works here, apart from picking up weight on the back? This is not even the tourist season. Mother, the way he did beat up Desraj. He can be booked under section 139, 333, 326 and 307 IPC. Its good that the whole blame was shifted on to the terrorists. Otherwise, he would had been in prison. You would have let him go to the prison. See, grandmother. If you will talk like this, I will really go to the prison. Go. Hey, if you are so fond of going to the prison, I will help you. Son, Pyare. Go after him. What if, he actually goes to the prison? He is very… stubborn… If he decides something, he surely does that. - Go son, go. - Mother, you don't worry. Prison is not a 5star hotel, that a person will go there, on his own will. He is just… Scaring you. Oh God. Its time for my work. Mother, I will take your leave. Why are you running like a monkey? Walk carefully. [GLASS SHATTERS] You be damned. [CHUCKLES] [INDISTINCT CHATTERS] JAI: Seems to be a decent girl. If I harass her, she will shout. She will scream. And take me to the prison. And I will be imprisoned. [WHISTLING] You are very pretty. And I admire your beauty. Not at all. He started saying. Take Rs. 200. I held him and imprisoned him. And beat him a lot. Bribe and me. If your decency had been damaged, then call the sub inspector. I am not scared of anyone. I can stand in the court and say, that I am an admirer of your beauty. I don't want an admirer. I want a customer. Let that sub inspector go. Or he will catch me again, today. Wrong no. JAI: If I steal this man's money. He will strait away take me to prison. Bill, only Rs.10, sir. Hh? Sir, I don't have change. Keep it. A tip from my side. 90 rupees… as tip? Yes, yes. Keep it. I believe that taking the change is an insult. Thank you, sir. Please, visit again. Bye, bye. Thief, thief, thief! Catch him. - Hey, what happened? - Thief. Catch him, catch him. You are stealing in broad day light? - This coat is yours? - Yes, exactly. Is this briefcase yours? Yes, yes, this hat too is mine. Then what are you waiting for? Call the sub inspector, the one standing there. Forgive me brother. I stole it from the railway station in the morning. How do I know that all thisis yours? I apologise. Hey. [SUITCASE DROPS] Son, Jai. It seems, going to the prison is more difficult than getting a job. I am Devendra Nath Modi's daughter. If you will try to harass me. I will get you imprisoned for 3 years. - Sub inspector! - Hhmm. What's the matter, madame? He has harassed me. You take him to the police station. I will tell you everything. Ok… Whose stuff is this? I don't know. I got it. Come to the station. Come! So, you have made arrangements for going to the prison? Do you know the punishment for harassing girls? As per section 3 IPC, 2 years of imprisonment. That too, non bailable. Mr. Pyare, I wanted to go to the prison in the past. Not now. - Why? - Pyare, I am feeling shy to tell you this. Tell me, tell me. What's there to be shy about? This world is very beautiful. - Now, I am in love with this world. - You, roadside Romeo! See madame, I will take care of him. You get your complaint registered here. On the road, he has put his hat on my head. - This hat is not mine. - He is a liar. This hat belongs to him. - You, say something. - Yes, yes. This hat belongs to him. This hat is not mine. Coward! If you are a son ofa man, then why do you lie? Quiet, quiet. This is the police station, station. OK, tell me. All this belongs to whom? All this is mine. So, this means that you had been bitten by the love bug. I didn't get it? Who has stolen what from whom? What has been stolen? Come here. - Listen to me. - Come. - There's my money in it. - Come, come. Wait, wait. There's my money in it. You harass girls, that too in the area of sub inspector PyareSingh. - Give back, y money. - Hhmm, quiet. I, I am sorry. I made a mistake. I can forgive this mistake on one condition. If you come along with me for lunch. I don't even like to talk to you. [SCOFFS] Hey! Listen! Not just talk, you will have to love me too. Hey, come. "Why do you show the attitude?"

Before I met you, my life was without any goal or destination. Now. Now, it seems like in this poor world. I got my abundance of happiness and peace. Hey Mister, I don't have a liking to fall in love. Nor do I have the habit, nor the time. If you will come closer, I will shout, so much... ...that the ice will melt from the mountains. I am a very stubborn girl. I will shoot you. Are you not afraid? The people who love are not afraid. They think that death is the gift of love. I, I will shoot. Hey, you don't come in between us.

But you have both the qualities. [TRAIN CHUGGING NEARBY] I have been thinking from a few days. - To tell you about my heart's desire. - I know. I woman can easily sense the motives and intentions of a man. This is the third quality of a woman. I have many lovers and you are one of them. Actually, I'm looking for a brave man. The one who can prove himself. My father was a freedom fighter at the age of 10. And I killed a snake at age 10. If you ever get a chance. You can confirm that. [BOING] The one who is coming here. He is after me like a shadow. Beat him so much, so much. That he never again dares to look at me. [BOING] And the fourth quality of a woman is... ...that she can easily make two men fight for her.

[WHOOSHING] [THUNDER RUMBLING] Leave my hand. - I can't leave your hand, Sonia. - I say, leave my hand. What all milestones, are coming in our love. That we are at the destination, but still have to keep walking. The people who hate us, someone, ask them. Why are you testing the ones in love? [THUNDER RUMBLING] Daughter. You didn't take a bath, yet? I have even served the dinner. All your friends are waiting for you. You all eat. I am not hungry. Your friends are going to Delhi tomorrow. Will you not meet them as well? I will meet in the morning. You were just fine. What keeps on happening to you, daughter? I have gone mad. Go away from here. Or I will break everything. [GLASS SHATTERS] She has been raised with a lot of love and care. Whenever she comes to her stubbornness. Even Mr Modi becomes helpless. Come. You all have dinner. Come. [THUNDER RUMBLING] "You are standing in front of me." "You are my morning." "You are my evening." "You are my body." "You are my life." "You are my body." "You are my life." "My heart longs for you." "My life is your love." "My life is your love." "I trust in your love." "You are the solace of my heart." "My life too is all there for you." "My life is your love." [THUNDER RUMBLING] Sonia. [TELEPHONE RINGING] [BACKGROUND MUSIC OVERLAPS DIALOGUE] What are you looking at? They are audacious. And you shameless. Come inside. Hey sir. Quench your thirst for love, from my vessel's sweet water. "White vessel. Sweet water." "I have added my youth into it." "If you are thirty, you can drink and see." "If you are thirsty, you can drink and see." "You can live in my arms, and see." "White vessel. Sweet water." "I have added my youth into it." "If you are thirsty, you can drink and see." "You can live in my arms, and see." "White vessel. Sweet wate…" "Why do you look at me like this? I feel anxious." "A breath comes in. And a breath goes out." "Why do you look at me like this? I feel anxious." "A breath comes in. And a breath goes out." "I will love you. I will rule your heart." "I will admire you every day. Will hug you and make love to you." "You are the only one. My beloved…" "Oh, oh, oh, oh." "White vessel. Sweet water." "I have added my youth into it." "If you are thirsty you can drink and see." "You can live in my arms, and see." "Haa…" "White vessel. Sweet water…" "I have been moulded in your love, my beloved." "I have been burnt of the cool breeze." "I have been moulded in your love, my beloved." "I have been burnt of the cool breeze." "Now, I will live with you." "And love you, day and night." "I will talk with love." "I will shower you with love." "You are the one my beloved…" "Oh, oh, oh, oh." "White vessel. Sweet water." "I have added my youth into it." "If you are thirsty, you can drink and see?" "You can live in my arms, and see." "Haa…" "White vessel. Sweet water…" You go. If madame will see, I will be insulted. Jai. Please go. I am not in my control. Jai, please. Don't make me weak. [MOANING] Are you angry with me? - It got late with the tourists. - [SCOFFS] How much do you earn? Enough, that I can give you a life of respect. Don't you believe me? I believe you. That's why I lost my heart to you. I like stubborn people like you. Because they have honesty. And if they decide something, they will surely do it. Then you should tell your father. No dear. I don't have such guts. Then, till when will we keep meeting, in hiding andin fear. Till the time I am not Caught, red handed. If your father doesn't like me, then? I will explain. If he says no, then? I will persuade. If he doesn't agree, then? Huh. I will die. [TYRE SCREECH] This is Mr.Modi's daughter. A chicken which gives golden eggs. But who is with her? Maybe, some hen. If he comes in between, cut the bastard. [SHRIEK] [HORSE'S NEIGH] Go! Leave my hand. Jai! Jai! Jai! [GROANS] [GROANS] Jai! Leave me! Leave! [TYRES SCREECHING] Hey, leave the way. I say, leave Sonia. Sarjudoesn't take anyone's orders. And Desraj, only gives orders to people like you. You... [GUNSHOT] Leave her. [GROANING] Tell me, where is Sonia? - I don't know. - Tell me. I will tell you. I will tell you. Leave. Leave me. I can never accept this. That you promise me of love, and make someone else your beloved. The promise, I made to you. It was not of love. But of friendship. It's the same thing. Love doesn't happen without friendship. And friendship doesn't happen without love. You only said... ...that I am handsome. As well as a gentleman. - What more do you want? - Jai loves me. And you force your love on me. You are acting very strongheaded. Today I will give you such a memorable gift. That you will start recognising me among thousands. [GRUNTS] Gopal, pick it up from there. Gopal… Where is your grandson? - He is at work. - He has abducted my daughter. Abducted? I am sorry. But you might have heard something wrong. - My grandson can't do any such thing. - He has done it. - The whole village is the witness. - If this is true. Then, be rest assured that I will send your daughter unharmed to your home. And then, what I will have to do of Jai I will do it. He has desired to touch the moon. I will get his hands cut off. And if he comes under my feet, I will just crush him. You must have earned a lot of money. If you would have earned a bit of humanity too. It would had been nice. You dare touch him. He is the grandson of Thakur Balram Singh, police commissioner. Not of any Modi. Wow. Your daughter has eloped. And to look for her, you chose my home? Stop it! It's enough now. As you have tried to tarnish our image and respect. You will have to listen. Let's go to Delhi. And make a police complaint. They must have died. Let’s go. [DOGS BARKING] Did the earth engulf my daughter? Or the sky ate her away? Mr. Dhanraj what kind of a MP are you? It’s been 18 hours and the police is still searching. You keep patience. Everything will be fine. What will be fine? Ask the home minister to send a helicopter. Send the commando force. Do whatever. I should find my daughter immediately. [SIGHING] Mr Modi, daughter Sonia is here. Let her take some rest. I will meet you later. Where were you? Father, you didn’t ask, “how am I?” I was attacked by goons. Jai saved my life and my respect too. When did you come to Delhi? I came at night itself. Then, why didn’t you come home? With whom were you wandering? With Jai. But you could have at least called. Father, Jai. Whenever I meetJai. I don’t remember anything else. I, I lose my senses. Are you listening, Sarin? One needs a heart of fire, to listen to this. A young daughter, for the whole night, wanders with an unknown guy. And doesn’t even have a trace of remorse on her face. In this situation, what kind of parents will like to live any further? Daughter, you are not as free as you think. Your life is connected with the respect of this home. And your father’s respect and reputation. I agree that youth, brings things like happiness, desires, needsand fun. But youth is not a toy to be played with. Youth is a responsibility, that needs to be taken care of. Daughter your limitless wandering outside the home. Can become a danger and curse for you. Please uncle. You are my father’s lawyer. I don’t mind. You are my father’s friend. I don’t mind. But I do mind, your sharp tongue. Sonia! Let her say all thisModi. She has grown up in my embrace. If the tsunami of the sea won’t hit its shores. Then what else will? What do you think of me? I am educated. I know what’s good or bad. I don’t like, if I am subjected to restrictions. Don’t do this, don’t do that. Don’t go here, don’t go there. But finally. But finally. What’s my limit? A woman’s limit is cast in iron. Shit. Sir. Daughter has arrived at the dining table. Daughter, just forget all that has happened. Now you are a graduate. I want to know, what do you want to do ahead? I, I don’t want to study further. Good. You are my wise daughter. Daughter I wish, that you should get married now. Even I think the same, father. If you really ask me, I am very happy with you today. If you agree, shall I look for a guy for you? I will look for the guy, father. Because I will have to spend my life with him. You don’t believe in my choice? That’s what I am asking you father. Don’t you believe in my choice? I understand what you want to say. I want that you should stop meeting rouges. Father, Jai is not a rogue. How do you know…? Daughter, I am your father. Why don’t you understand? What more can I ask for than your wellbeing? Don’t you respect me even this much? Father, I respect you. But I am in love with Jai. You can spend money for me. You can give me all the luxuries of the world. But my happiness, my happiness, can only be given by Jai. Daughter, don’t take me wrong. But even if you don’t take my happiness as yours. I take your happiness as mine. Call him for tea, tomorrow at 5. I want to meet him. Father! Oh, father! I think, I have seen you somewhere. Sir, my name is Jai. Those flowers that you sent to Sonia. They were delivered by me. Oh. The shoes are dirty. Don’t hesitate, carpet can be changed. Sonia bought it from Iran. She is fond of buying new and beautiful things. Well. - Sir, this. - Keep it with you. Decorate them in Sonia’s room with your own hands. She has gone out to take care of your dinner. She must be back soon. What work do you do? Sir, I can do any such work. That is not possible for anyone else. This means, you don’t do anything worthwhile. Come. Let me show you Sonia’s room. These areSonia’s clothes. She is very fond of clothes. Do you see this saree? It’s embellished withdiamonds and pearls. She got it from Paris. What will you do by knowing the price? You must have seen it for the first time. All these shoes and footwear, belong to Sonia. She just wears them a couple of times, and throws them away. These shoes reminded me of something. A person always buys a shoe, which is fit for his feet. No one buys, a smaller or a bigger one. The subject of marriage is also similar. People look for alliance in equal households. Not in bigger or smaller ones. Sir, Sonia knows about my income. She understands the difference between love and wealth. I will keep her like a flower, sir. You can make her happy with the magic of love. But can’t give her lifelong happiness. Sonia is an innocent girl, been raised in the lap of luxury. Your delicate shoulders of love... ...can’t take the burden of demands and tantrums. Only wealth can do that. Sir, I request you. Don’t weigh my love with gold and pearls. - We both… - I know it pretty well. The purpose of poor guys like you... ...is only to sweet talk girls of wealthy households. And to get their money, nothing else. Your love is fake, it’s a drama. Sir, if it’s about wealth? Then tell me, how much wealth should I earn? That you will be able to give Sonia’s hand into mine. Even if you become the richest man of the world. I still won’t give Sonia’s hand into yours. Because even if someone becomes rich. Yet the stench of poverty, doesn’t go away from them, for at least, 40 years. Rich man. Even I have a tongue. The poor only have a tongue. What else can they have? And to get hold of rogues like you. We keep strong hands too. Ill mannered! I will destroy you. Jai, what has got into you? You have a lot of pride on your unreliable wealth. Just a day’s hunger, and an hour of thirst. Removes this gap between rich and poor. Jai please. I don’t like such things. Sonia, I want to take you along. Just now, at this moment. You will have to decide. You want me or your father? Daughter, he is right. You will have to chose one among us. Before taking a blind step, do remember. That you won’t get a place in this home again. Father, space shouldn’t be in homes. But in the hearts. Stop! As you have decided to go away from my heart. Then for whom shall I live? And why should I live? Tell me. Do you want him or me? No. I want both of you. Jai, apologise to father. Jai, please. Stop. The thing for which you came up to this home. Atleast take that along. And don’t ever show your face again. Jai, pleasestop. Jai, for my sake. [GLASS BREAKAGE] Sonia. Whenever you develop a hatred for your father’s golden cage. Do break it and come. I will be waiting for you. And rich man! If you try to marry Sonia anywhere. Then remember, I will abduct her from the ceremony. Where had you been for so many days? I went to Delhi, grandmother. Why? There is this girl Sonia. I went to drop her home. What all you did till now had been enough. And now you are learning new things? What wrong did I do? Hey, the girl’s father came here. And said that you have made her elope with you. - And? - And what? Even the people of the village say the same thing. I will drink their blood. All of them. Iam asking. What relation do you have with that girl? Say, Why don’t you say anything? I love her grandmother. So, Mr Modi said the right thing. - Grandmother. - Go away from me. Do you know, I had lived with so much of pride? And today. Today you have not even left me in the position to step out of the home. Grandmother, at least listen to me. I would have begged in front of her father. I would have fulfilled all your desires. But you. You are doing the same thing. That your father did, in his stubbornness. He married against the wishes of your grandfather. But it would had only been a year. Your mother and father were murdered on the road. Do you know that? I just know, that I can’t be happy without Sonia. Son, relationships, can’t be nurtured on the basis of hatred and anger. If you wish to be married? I will find the prettiest of girl for you, son. Grandmother, I want only Sonia. No one else. [THUNDERING CLOUDS] What does father think of himself? If he can blackmail me about dyeing. Then, I can also die for his wealth and reputation. I don’t want his… [SOBBING] [SOBBING CONTINUES] To get hold of rogues like you. We keep strong hands too. I'll destroy you. Remember. Just a day’s hunger, and an hour of thirst. Removes this gap between rich and poor. - Hello. - I am Modi this side. Yes. At this hour? What’s the urgency? I want Sonia to be married. As soon as possible. You give an advertisement in all the newspapers of India. For a good alliance. Someone who is capable enough to be my son in law. Okay. I will do it through my address. You are with me, when there’s no one else. I want to make love to you, that’s what my heart desires. What has happened to me, today my beloved? I want to make love to you, that’s what my heart desires. What has happened to me, today my beloved? Don’t trouble me, I myself am troubled. Have some pity on my youth, heatless. I want to make love to you, that’s what my heart desires. What has happened to me, today my beloved? Don’t trouble me, I myself am troubled. Have some pity on my youth, heartless. I want to make love to you, that’s what my heart desires. What has happened to me, today my beloved? [MUSIC CONTINUES] May the light of love be aflame. Keep it safe from the world. Do remember my fire, beloved. Always keep it in your heart, hidden. Even if the whole universe puts all its force. We won’t be separated, even when apart. I want to make love to you, that’s what my heart desires. What has happened to me, today my beloved? Don’t trouble me, I myself am troubled. Have some pity on my youth, heartless. I want to make love to you, that’s what my heart desires. What has happened to me, today my beloved? Comeover now, by leaving your world. Atleast listen to my heart’s wish. Love is God, I swear to God. How will humans be able to take it away from us? I have written your name on my youth. I want to make love to you, that’s what my heart desires. What has happened to me, today my beloved? Don’t trouble me, I myself am troubled. Have some pity, on my youth, heartless. I want to make love to you, that’s what my heart desires. You are my life, you are my universe? Don’t trouble me, I myself am troubled. Have some pity, on my youth, heartless. I want to make love to you, that’s what my heart desires. You are my life, you are my universe? Stop. Raju, you? I am the ASP of this area. Hhmm. And you ned to address me as, sir. You met me as a dead man... ...or I would have peeled off your skin. The mischief that you did to me, its debt is still pending with me. If you will ever get life back in you. I will pay my debt for sure. I am getting married to Sonia. If you bring Sonia’s name onto your tongue... ...I will beat you till you become dumb. You are acting really oversmart. I am telling you for the last time, forget about Sonia. If you will take Sonia’s name, I will make your life difficult. Remember you have tied my hands not my confidence. Throw him outside his home. What? What has happened to you? Mother. - He had hit the ASP. - So what? Why did he beat him so cruelly? Come. Come son. Get up, son. Come. What’s left that you have come to tell me? Now, you might have known what the truth is. And what was the lie. And? Didn’t I say that. My grandson, can’t do a dirty thing like abducting someone. And? Jai and Sonia, love each other with all their heart. And? Jai has become disheartened from life. I, I have come here. To ask for the alliance. Before making a wish like this. It would had been better, if you would had looked at your status at least once. We are not as per your status. But with the grace of God. We are not that poor, that we have to live hand to mouth. I promise you, I will take care of Sonia as a queen. I believe in realities, not in words What’s your status? What do you know about our status? That you live in a rented home. No land, no property. Not even a business. And on top of that. The guy is unemployed and shameless. At one side there is this king. And on the other the pennyless guy. Wow. Your boy said something... ...and you just found just my door to ask for an alliance? Stop! You have said enough. Money and status are temporary. You have not yet recognised our decency. Your decency was broken into pieces on that day itself. The day you spoke mannerlessly with me. I remember every word. Then you would also have remembered. The day you came with your daughter’s desire to my home. I took away my grandson’s happiness and gave the horse to you. It was an animal’s child. Sonia is my child. She is a part of my heart. Wearing the mask of decency, to do away with your problems. You have come here to crack a good deal. Pyare Singh. Let’s go from here. But a market. Relationships are bought and sold here. Even in the time of crisis... ...the decency of a decent man doesn’t become any less. Even if you make 100 pieces of gold... ...the value of gold doesn’t become less. Take this sir. Here is the approval for your factory. This is the import licence. And this is the export licence. I have fulfilled my promise. Thanks a lot. Your gift will be sent to your home. Whatever needs to be given to others. You give it on your own. Thanks a lot. Hey. Come, come Sarin. You too came at a good time. It’s something important. Aah... I will come back later. Mr Dhanraj is also our special friend. What do we have to hide from him? The advertisement that we gave. For Sonia’s matrimonial alliance. These are the replies for it. These are a few pictures shortlisted by me. Is there anyone, who is worthy enough to be replied? Not actually… These are just OK, Okay. Hhmm. Then give out the advertisement, in the newspapers of London and America. I was also thinking that. Even I have a photograph. - This is your son. - He is the only child. The only heir of my wealth. He is even well settled. Yes, he is not a businessman. But if you wish you can make him one. My son stays at your place or mine after the wedding. It’s one and the same thing. We politicians, don’t break the ties. We mend the ties. Why am I kept imprisoned in this house? I have started feeling suffocated. With whom shall I talk? I am here, child. When do you have any time from your lakhs and crores... ...that you will talk to me? You have become really spoilt. For whom am I doing all this? For your wellbeing only. I don’t want money but love, father. A sense of belongingness. I think her schooling has been done wrong. Dildara. Where is Jai? Tell Jai. To immediately come to Delhi and take me along. What happened, Dildara? What’s the matter? Dildara. What’s this? Sonia? Sonia. Sonia, daughter. Sonia. Jai. Sonia. Sonia. Let’s get out of here fast. Fast. Come. [TRAIN HORN BLARING] Hey. Grandmother, this is Sonia. So, at last, you fulfilled your stubbornness. Now, see my stubbornness too. I can’t give a place to such a girl. One who has eloped. Grandmother, you are getting it wrong. I have not abducted her. Grandmother. I have come with Jai with my consent. You should not have come, daughter. We are people of the old times. We respect the rules and regulations of the society. We are happy like this only. Grandmother, I will do as you say. The way you will keep me, I will live. We just want your love and acceptance. Grandmother. Jai. Take her away. Till the time, her father doesn’t marry her with his consent. I won’t accept her. You go. Grandmother, keep a rock on my chest. I will endure. I, I can’t take your indifference. Don’t push us away. Grandmother, give us your blessings. You don’t need my blessings anymore. You have really grown up. You can understand what’s good or bad. What? What do you think? I won’t be able to live without you. Is it? I, I can live without you too. I can live without you too. Go away. - I say, go away. - Grandm… [THUNDERING CLOUDS] - I will shoot both of them. - Modi, have you gone mad? Problems are not solved through anger and impulse. Sarin! I have started hating Sonia and even myself. I will endeverything. But the time to kill them has not yet arrived. When it arrives, we will see to it. I will look for both of them. I will make them understand. And maybe, I will be successful in ending this storm. A mirror, once broken is broken. Who will marry, that notorious girl? If you would have had a son... ...would you have liked to accept her asyour daughter in law? I will accept Sonia as my daughter in law. Even if she becomes pregnant. If a friend doesn’t mend, another friend’s reputation. Then what good is this friendship for? We politicians, don’t break the paths. But bridge those paths. [TEMPLE BELL] [BOTH] God. [BOTH] You be the witness. [BOTH] We will stay together for lives to come. [BOTH] We promise... [BOTH] ...we will be equal partners. [BOTH] In each other’s good and bad times. Children. Marriage is a union of two hearts. And who can be a bigger witness than God? Till the time you don’t have a home. You both can stay at my place. Come. [THUNDERING CLOUDS] First night comes once in a woman’s life. And remains as a memory. I will make her ready. I will do her make up. I will make her a bride. And then, I will present her to you. You wait for a while. Come daughter. Come. Come son. Come. Now say. My bulbul. Laila. [WHISTLING] These are my own. I have brought just a few. These are few for you. But a lot to make me weak and notorious. You did not do the right thing, Sonia. Jai, forgiveme please. Take them away. And just return now. Wherever you will go, Sarju will keep coming there. Like your shadow. With a message of your death. Deva! Changa! There are goons, at Durga aunty’s home. Children. You both run away. The men of our village will take care of them. Go. Go. You both reached. At the right time and at the right place. Uncle. We, we have got married. Uncle, is there any law in the world. That states that the girl’s choice is not important for marriage? If not? Then why am I being subjected to this cruelty? Uncle, if because of Jai. My father’s grand reputation is getting tarnished. Then, I will never meet my father. I will never tell my father’s name to anyone. I will live without a name. Uncle, I swear of Jai. I make a promise. Hello. Modi. Sonia and Jai have been found. You bring them to Delhi immediately. And listen, Mr Dhanraj is also there. If you will needany help, you can meet him or his son. Got it? But they have got married. What nonsense? This is the reality Modi. And to accept the reality, is a human’s responsibility. You are teaching me values? I didn’t expect this from you. Uncle, this is the jewellery. Which Sonia brought in her innocence. Children, I am with you to extinguish this fire. We politicians, don’t extinguish the fire. We ablaze it. Son. What is the punishment for stealing jewellery and abducting a girl? IPC 380 and IPC 366. Punishment is 10 years imprisonment. And for the one who helps them? IPC 216. And punishment, 7 years. Then, what are you looking at? Do your duty. Come. Well done. You gavesuch agood return for my love. What sin did I do? The idea of sin and virtue is amongst God and humans. Among, parents and children its about happiness and sadness. You have given me that pain. That with its wound, my soul has become restless. Father, why have you changed so much? Why are Sarin uncle and Jai imprisoned? Why are they getting tangled, in the lies of a fake case? What wrong have they done to you? They have provokedyou. They have made you dare. This is a lie, father. Jai didn’t abduct me. I went with Jai, consensually. Jai didn’t steal the jewellery. Actually, he scolded me. And returned them to uncle Sarin. I brought the jewellery. As I thought it was my own. Do you want to say anything else? Father, get Sarin uncle and Jai free. Or? Or I will tell in the court. That all the allegations on them. Are fake, made up, and without any basis. Why? Because. Because. I have married Jai. I donít agree to this marriage. Where there are no blessings of the elders... ...thatís not a marriage. Itís just fake promises and fake swears. Keep it with you. And if she tries to step out of home... ...shoot her. I will take the blame on myself. She must be thinking. That she can get all her desires fulfilled... ...by being stubborn in front of me. Because I love her a lot. But she doesnít know. That, I love my reputation more than her. Keep this revolver with you. I am sorry, sir. I canít take your order. I had heard that businessmen never become angry. But sir. What kind of a person is that... ...who doesnít remember God, in their luxury? And doesnít fear God, in their ego? The path on which Sonia has started walking. Itís her own destiny. Sir, a human can fight everyone. But they canít fight, their own destiny. I have not seen mother. But God has sent you as a mother for me. I know. You all are becoming against me. Even if the whole world backs her up. Still, I wonít let that happen. The thing that she wishes for. I want to marry Sonia with your son. Are you ready? Hey, you want to do a good deed. And you areasking. We politicians, donít just laugh. We make the others laugh too. You stay stress free... ...and make all the arrangements of the wedding, at my farm house. Yes. Jai. Modi is getting Sonia married to Desraj. On his farmhouse. Sir, sir, sir. Huh? Sir a catastrophe happened. What has happed? Tell me, at least. Sir both of them broke the lock, and ran away from the prison. Where were you? Sir, at that time I went to the washroom. Desraj. Half of Indiaís idiots have joined the police. And the rest of the idiots? Like me, they have joined politics. Get lost from here. Yes sir. Sir. Get lost. Yes sir. Yes sir. You look for him. And make sure, he doesnít reach the marriage venue. Sir, you go. I will see them. You reach the wedding venue at any cost. I will bring the magistrate along. Hey! Whatís this? My cart. Kid! You have played a lot of hide and seek. You are really fond of reaching the wedding venue. Sarju will take you. Not to the wedding venue, but to your pyre. I am a soldier of love. I will go even by crossing, the well of blood. Really? What nonsense is this? Why have you not groomed her yet? And why have you not applied henna? Stubbornness too has a limit. Come with me. Everything will be fine. Our women will make Sonia understand. Groom her and bring along. Come. Come. Mr Modi. I am afraid... ...I am here to stop this wedding. Why? Because this marriage is illegal. As the girl is already married. Do you have a proof? I am the proof. In front of me. In the temple of Lakshmi Narayan. Jai and Sonia... ...by accepting God as the supreme power. Exchanged garlands. This woman just said something and you accepted it? The witness for my truthfulness is the whole village. If they will come to know... ...that their auntís honesty is being questioned. Then let me tell you... ...you wonít get any place to even hide. This is blackmailing. Mr Dhanraj, pressuring a married woman... ...into second marriage is a crime. Which can lead to a punishment. As per section 366 IPC itís 10 years of imprisonment. Mr lawyer... ...as pr the Hindu marriage Act 1955. As per section 7. Law doesnít agree to a wedding which didnít happen... ...as per theHindu rituals. For marriage... ...Itís required to walk around the vedi, 7 times. We politicians, donít just know the law. We evenmake the law. I donít need the lawís permission... ...to get my daughter married. I am her father. To take care of her wellbeing is my responsibility. My concern. Mr magistrate. And the one for whom, this ruckus is being created. Where is he? Mr. Modi. Mr. Modi I am telling you for the last time. Till the time, court doesnít give its decision. This marriage canít take place. Or for insulting the law... ...I can get you arrested. Do you know who is that guy? And this person? These are runaway goons. And by listening to their false testimony. You just came here, at this time. To tarnish my reputation. Remember... ...I will sue you for my defamation. Modi, you donít know the nuances of law. Why are you doing harm to yourself? Thereís no benefit to talk to him. I will issue an arrest warrant towards him. - Come with me. - No, Mrmagistrate. You came at your own wish. But you will leave only as per our wish. Our guards know, how to take care of you. First you see the wedding rituals. Then I will drop you, wherever you want. We politicians, donít become fools. But make others fool. Mr Modi. Come. The bride might have reached the vedi. [Chanting in Sanskrit.] Mr Modi. I said one day. That if you will try to marry Sonia to someone else. I will take her from the venue. I am here to fulfil my promise. Stop him. Sonia! Daughter. Jai! Sonia, daughter. What has happened? I became a beggar in just one second. Father, you scolded me. That I had not applied henna in my hands. See this. Forgive me, daughter. Forgive me. Jai! Son jai! Son jai. What sort of stubbornness is this? I just died. Grandmother, you said... ...that you. That you. Can live without me as well. You said that, grandmother. No. No, son Jai. Donít go. You will have to be alive till my indemnification. Who else do I have in this world? Who else? Grandmother says. That till the time... ...you donít marry me with your consent. She wonít accept me. Jai. Jai. Jai. Jai. Became a victim of stubbornness. Became a victim of stubbornness. Became a victim of stubbornness.
