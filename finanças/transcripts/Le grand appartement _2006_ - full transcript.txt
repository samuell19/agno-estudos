- Hi, Lucette, Armand! - Hello, Francesca! - Is that the granddaughter? - Yes. The granddaughter. Judgment reserved until the 27th. No, the 4th. - Yes? - Francesca Cigalone. I'm representing my grandmother. - Has our case been called? - Take a seat and wait. My husband was too nice to his tenants. Mrs. Falingard, I told him so on many occasions. He said that a successful apartment block is one where rich and poor, tradesmen and artists live side by side. Shut up or I'll bite you. Falingard versus Ardilouze. A successful apartment block is one where rents are high and paid regularly. - Pardon? - We're discussing the rent-control laws. That tangle of contradictory texts. A total shambles. The tenants are always protected and the unfortunate landlords are always in the wrong. Your lawyer isn't here? No. What about yours? - He's not here, I don't know why. - Case postponed for two weeks. State versus Manaranche. I'm so sorry, I got caught in the most horrendous traffic… You get paid to be on time. Well paid. Excuse me… Hello, Francesca? How did it go? I can't tell you on the phone. I'll pick you up on the way to the lawyer's. I can't come with you… Barbara Stanwyck could say, "Totally." A woman in 19th century Montana can't talk like a Parisian hipster. But to revamp the station, we need to get more up-to-date. So, for the makeover, it's fluorescent set design and bimbas? - Bimbos! - Bimbas. Bimbo for guys, bimba for girls. Totally. Anyway, the makeover doesn't include dialogue or subtitles. This fertile land is ours, now. This valley… The whole valley looks like it's celebrating, it's glad to see us. The whole valley looks like it's celebrating. It's glad to see us. And we're glad to be here. What's biting you? We've hardly stopped in three days. We're gonna make Lot 77 the prettiest ranch in the whole territory. We'll eat thick steaks every day. Totally. And we'll be rich. She can't say that. - It's weird. - See? The actors can feel it too. Yes, you're right. Of course! She can say, "You're right." "You're right," OK. Carry on a little… We're almost there. You should be proud of yourself for bringing us here. - So? - Postponed for two weeks. Why did you ask me to come? Martin's here. I have to go, I have a showing. The whole team's waiting for me. Your lipstick's funny. - It protects me. - From what? From the elements. You are an element. Hope you sort it out. There. Look at him, running away. Martin's cowardice can sometimes be breathtaking. He's not cut out to be confrontational. That's probably why I love him. We're late, come on. I'm very displeased with you. Pardon me? I am displeased because we're going to lose. And I don't like losing, Mr. Cigalone. Explain to your wife that the world is changing. She's not my wife. So explain to your daughter. I am this lady's lodger. I am neither her father nor Mr. Cigalone. Adrien Jacques Eglantier, producer, director, theoretician, teacher, actor, disciple of Jean Vigo… Not now, Adrien. Apart from not showing up in court, how can you help us keep our apartment? What? You think you can stay there? You won't win! These rent-controlled apartments are a real scandal. - I do not share your opinion. - Your opinion is that of a tenant. Apartment blocks are not the concern of tenants. The rent-control laws are contrary to those of the marketplace. They are even contrary to the principle of ownership. You have to understand that the world has changed. You are an educated man, Mr. Rosier. Eglantier! Eglantier, if you wish. One has to manage one's money and make savings. You have to move with the times, Ms. Cigalone. You must be wondering what we're doing there. Frankly, yes. You're the firm's least important case and we are going to make fools of ourselves. Fine. Then we're leaving. Come on, Adrien. Be my guest! I release you from your obligations. I just want to say, your tie may match your handkerchief, but you are sorely lacking in elegance. When lawyers stink, they really stink. Yeah, but in the meantime, we're screwed. How come you Cigalones get yourselves into these impossible situations? It's very unpleasant. Have some consideration for your housemates. - Look out! - Are you nuts? - My new car! - So be more careful, idiot. - What's wrong with you? - You're pathetic. - You should try Prozac! - I hope your wife is cheating on you! What's up with her? You look like a reasonable man… - Wrong way, asshole! - Fuck you. Get out of there, you idiot! Back up! Morning, everyone. Oussamba, how's things? Say, Adrien, did she eat a crocodile? You can say that again. - Hi, Armand. - Sorry. Chatty as ever, I see. Give me a little Salers, Armand. Please… A quatrain. A motorist accountant Almost knocked Francesca down She tossed out a list of curses And the trucker lapped them up - Pathetic. - Set it to music. - Nice suit. Where'd you get it? - Paris. - Are we coming to your place Sunday? - Yes, we're having pili-pili. - Are you okay, sweetie? - Yes. - You too? - Yes. - Done your homework? - Can she sleep over? Did you ask your parents? - Yes. - OK. It's bath time. I'll be there in a minute. That's beautiful. - You don't look so good. - I'm OK. You look upset. - What's wrong? - Nothing. I don't want my big sister to be sad. - I'm fine, really. - Oh dear! Honestly, don't worry. Everything's OK. - What's she doing? - No, Josephine, not in here! - What are you doing here? - This is the living room! You really think so? Josephine, don't pretend you don't know. The bathroom's here. Don't you remember? Francesca is a bad girl! It's nothing… I'm sick of that dream. I'm too old for school and for getting my wrists slapped. Something is bothering me, but what? Martin? At the computer already. Martin, I think this is the first time I've seen him from behind. Seen from the front, men are always acting out. It's the back that tells the truth. With Martin, it's clearly a frivolous, fragile back which can't carry anything very heavy. Deep down, I don't know Martin. What does he think? What does he do when I'm not there? Does he love me? He probably doesn't know himself. Hello, Daddy. You're already up? - Did you work all night? - Almost. - Hello, Mommy. - Hello, my darling. - Did you have a good sleep? - Yes. You smell good. You smell of soap. - Where are you going? - You know where. I'm taking a plane to Florence later. - What? - The tribute to Zavattini, De Sica's screenwriter. You said you weren't going. You said de Sica's heroes depressed you because you're just like them. - Which is true, by the way. - Could you sew this lining before I go? - Have you had breakfast? - No. Go on, I'll be there in a minute. What keeps me and Martin together? Other people. My sister, who's almost my daughter, because we adopted her. My sister Victoria, my orphan. Always last to get out of bed, always surrounded by girlfriends. What keeps us together is, of course, our daughter. And Grandma, who's starting to lose her marbles. Adrien doesn't keep us together, he keeps us on our toes. He sees himself in the films he makes. - Good morning. - I'm looking for the bathroom. - Straight ahead. - Down here? Thanks. - Adrien is unbelievable. - Cover yourself up. He's old enough for herbal tea but insists on Champagne. - She's helping me sort my reels. - We heard, all night long. Yes. What keeps us together is the fact that we live together. So it's this apartment. People come and go, some get stuck here. Adrien came to stay for two weeks, with all his equipment and boxes full of reels. That was over five years ago. So it's this apartment that keeps us together. It's funny, your girlfriends are all the same. A little bit ditsy and younger than you. At my age, everyone's younger than me. I liked the last one. What was her name? - Lizzie? - Lucie! Yeah, it was an L month. She was different. Her name was Coco. - She was nice. - Yes, she was. Isabelle, will you recite your poem for me? Along the wall… Poetry makes me want to go back to school! - This is Marion. - Hello. - Can I have some coffee? - This is mine. There's more on the table. - What a gentleman! - I'll have an apple. OK, I'm leaving. - Hello. - Marion. It's an M month. No, this is my coffee from my coffee-maker. Bye, Daddy. - Goodbye. - See you soon. Do you think this is a good time, with all these problems? Don't worry, all of you. Nothing will happen. I'm leaving for Florence with an easy mind. See you soon. Martin! Yes? Your lining, you can sew it yourself. Can I recite my poem or not? Along the wall… It's a wonderful apartment, warm and comfortable, but it's hard to tear yourself away. When I leave, I feel like a deserter. If I'm a deserter, I must be fleeing a war, but which war? I'm looking for peace. Where better to find it than Florence, like every year, alone at last, beside the Arno, mending my lining? - Want me to help you? - I'd love that. - Nice to meet you. Véronique Printemps. - Martin Cigalone. Give me that. What are you doing in Florence? I'm attending the Zavattini festival, de Sica's screenwriter. - I saw you at the Hotel Serviti. - Yes, we're all staying there. Are you a critic? I do lots of things. I should probably concentrate on one. I'm a teacher, critic, screenwriter, I do some dubbing, too… - I love people who are versatile. - Really? Martin. - I like you. - Yes, but… - You don't waste any time. - Why would I? You're really not my type. Good. I can't stand men who pounce on me. I only like world-weary men… Difficult prey. You're very charming, but I don't think… Look at the time! I have to get back to the hotel! - So do I. - What? No. We can share a taxi. OK, then hurry. It makes me so hot when a man resists. What's wrong? Are you gay? Not at all, I'm totally straight. I mean, really, I'm… So? I'm so straight, I don't want to cheat on my wife. - She's not there. - Is that what you think? - It's rare for a man to excite me so much. - Really? - You know, Martin… - What? The best love-making happens in the taxi. Véronique, I must tell you… I'm being an idiot. Why am I behaving like an innocent? I'm scared Francesca will find out. That's what fidelity is. It's fear. Or fear of complications. No, it must be fear. OK, Véronique. It was very nice, thank you. There. Goodbye, Véronique! Thank you, Miss. Enjoy your stay. Friends of mine. Stay there. - Aldo! - Martin! La verità! Cesare Zavattini. Let me introduce you to Roberto. You're Moretti's little brother? His nephew. - Martin! - You're here! Last time we met, it was for that article, "La birichina di papà." - At Lugano? - Yes. "Il… discorso della birichina di papà." "Il discorso della birichina di papà." Mrs. Cigalone. You have an authorized overdraft of 1,200 euros. You are currently at 1,642 euros and 50 centimes. It's not good enough. You promised to clear your overdraft. I'm sorry, my husband is away at the moment, I have a lot of expenses and I don't have any work. It's complicated. Hello? Yes, Martin. It's him. No, I didn't forget the bank. I'm there right now. I can't talk. I see that you are very alone in dealing with your responsibilities. This is sadly the case for many women today. So, what are we going to do to remedy your situation? I have a solution. - Which is? - People should stop using banks. - Stop using banks? - Yes, banks. What do you mean? We shouldn't have to go through the bank to get our money. We should be able to… I mean, get money in cash or endorsable checks, like we used to. We want an end to money laundering! The banks and government have taken the little people hostage, those on small incomes and low wages! We are not born free and equal before the law! To them, we are born to be bank customers! Those who want to launder money have founded their own bank. And we have to endure the sadism of the banking tyrants on the first day of every month! - Free! - Yes! - Equal! - Yes! - Bank customers! - No! - Got any other ideas like that? - Yes. All of these. Shall we scratch? I see. I am dealing with a gambler. Gambling is a social evil. I know all about it, I'm leading a campaign to ban games of chance. I am in favor of abolishing all chance in the life of society. And particularly, in marriage. The public authorities should bring couples together. There would be fewer separations, fewer tragedies, less loneliness, and therefore fewer bank overdrafts. I can help you to get free of this vice. When you feel tempted, call me. Shouldn't we check the cards? Well… We're in the same hotel as last year. Aldo really took care of me. I'm finishing my paper, it's OK. Sorry, Francesca, there's someone at the door. I have to go, it's the festival people. Véronique! Allow me to explain. This may sound very old-fashioned to you, but if you think this will lead to anything, then forget it. Right. We have to be very clear. - You are absolutely my type. - I know. - But I don't want to cheat on my wife. - Then it's a one-shot! - What does that mean? - A one-night stand. You won't fall into the trap of a double life, the lies and secrets. That's what scares you, isn't it? I'm scared of that English thing you said, I never heard it before. We won't see each other again, I'll leave you alone. - What is it again? - One-shot. I'll show you what it is. This bed is great! Come on, hurry up. - Wait, my computer. - I'm so turned on… - My paper… Come on. I love your body. You have baby skin. I want you! Show me the beast inside you. Come here, quickly. Don't you ever stop? - You're very chatty… - Does it bother you? - It distracts me. I don't know if I can.. - I love these big socks… Some words make me go blank. So shut up, then! Come on. Come on! Let's go! What's the matter? - The doorbell. - No! - Martin! - Someone rang, I have to open the door. Coming! - Mr. Cigalone, the festival gift bag. - I already received it. - The sponsor's gift bag. - What? Please. A bottle of Chianti, truffle oil, spaghetti, prosciutto… Grazie. Thank you. When you're ready, we're waiting for you. There's quite a crowd. - Wonderful, thank you. - Goodbye. Now, let's see. After all that, where were we? Let me refresh your memory. Let yourself go, I want to try something. - What? - You'll see. No. I want to know first. - Do you trust me? - No. - You don't trust me? - I want to know first. I told you, you'll like it. Trust me! Go on! Murderer! I'm going to die! I'm going to die! She looks like a cathedral and a bitch. A cathedral and a bitch. I'm going to die! Shall I answer? A cathedral and a bitch. No. - Yes? - Martin, it's me. Don't speak so loudly, I can't hear you. Something's happened, I knew it would. Why didn't you warn us? That's the children's room. What do I do about the bailiff? - What do I tell him? - Which bailiff? I think it's the Cofico bailiff. - What do I do? - Cofico, what's that? It must be a loan you took out. Don't panic, I totally disagree with that kind of loan. - It's theft. - So why did you take out the loan? Tell the bailiff that nothing belongs to me. And also, tell him we're not married, do you hear? We're not married. All that fuss and you're not married? Here are the documents. Yes, I know. I know Mr. Cigalone very well. He says you know each other. No, nothing. - Pass him over to me. - He wants to talk to you. Yes? - Mr. Blavache. - It seems we know each other? Absolutely, Mr. Cigalone. I'd be very surprised. Yes, you remember, February 6th at 4:44 p.m., third floor of your apartment block. You obstructed the corridor, saying that the receiver and I were scaring a child. Yes. You know that a bailiff does not have the right to take revenge? You are the slave of the law. The law does not take revenge! Do you understand? Do you understand? Pass me over to my wife. Yes, indeed, Mr. Cigalone. Yes? Don't worry. I talked to him, it should work out. Sorry, but I am worried. "Iron." A barbarian's in the house, how can I not worry? Calm down. Don't make the situation worse. What's he doing? In any case, everything here belongs to my grandmother. It's her apartment. You mean this lady? No, my paternal grandmother. My father's mother. Martin, I'll call you back! Véronique, I have to go. Wait. - Martin! - Yes? - I'm locked in! - What do you mean? Do something, quickly! I'm claustrophobic! - Did you turn the knob? - Of course, I did! - Put soap in the lock. - That's a stupid idea, it won't work! It's the only idea I can come up with. Martin, I'm suffocating! Do something! I'll call for assistance. I would like to speak to the reception. Yes, a festival manager. It won't be long. Where is he? - We are here. - Someone's coming to open the door. Here he is. - Yes, Francesca? - Adrien's showing him the bills. - What are those screams? - Screams? The film has started, I'll call you later. Martin! Mind my suit! I'm on stage in five minutes. - Aldo will look after you. - You're leaving me? - We'll meet at the screening. - Martin, no! Martin! - I'll be back! - Goodbye! - Was that the right method? - We'll find out. It's nice living with the Cigalones. I have to love them, I've been here so long. There's Victoria, her girlfriends… The crackpot grandmother… And those two in the middle of it all… Play legato. You're playing too pizzicato. Your fingers aren't balanced. He's making progress. He is, you know. Let me introduce you to my friends. - Adrien, Sylvestre. - Hello. - Hello. - Francesca. - It's them? - Who? The French people lost in the legal labyrinth. Yes, that's us. They didn't even stash their furniture. How are you? - Where do you live? - Seventh district. The seventh? What's so funny? The bailiffs do what they want there. They wouldn't dare come to Cergy. They'd be spotted by the look-outs. By the what? The look-outs. - You have look-outs? - Yes! Even if they did come, our furniture would already be at the neighbors. Who is bothering you, my girl? If only you knew! A lot of people. We are protected by Mama Oussamba. We must install a protection system in your apartment. African. Very African. No, Oussamba is introducing me to his lawyer friend. I'll introduce you to the spirits. - Do you believe in it? - Your politicians consult astrologers. Our wizards have no more power than yours, but they're ours. Cognac Martell. Cognac Martell? Africa… And now, Martin Cigalone, our great friend, is going to talk to us about the great screenwriter Cesare Zavattini, the man who shouted in the streets, "Omo, veni foras!" Which, for those who forgot their Latin, means "Man, get up!" - Over to you, Martin, thank you. - Thank you. In Zavattini's screenplays, we often find the following description, "There is a road and we see a very small figure, "in the far distance, "and we don't know who it is." "But the figure comes closer and we know we'll get a good look at them." "We don't know if they are part of our story, but we think so." This is the conception of a film, it's like life. We meet people… She looked like… She looked like a cathedral and a bitch. And we don't know if they will be with us until the end of the story or if they'll leave before then. I don't believe it. Armand, I don't believe it. Why are you selling? Who's the buyer? Is it a bank, a florist? You could at least answer. Is it a bank? Not another bank! We can't say anything until it goes through. The owners won't buy us out. They're offering Auvergnat money, instead of Aveyronnais prices. What's an Aveyronnais price? It's double. What about us? This is our neighborhood bistro, after all. In ten seconds, the TGV will come. TGV! So how was the audition? They gave Metral the part. Well, then, forget it. You said it was barely a part. They certainly won't forget me. May I read you… an Alexandrine which came to me? You want to bank the blooming cherries But the Aveyronnais is watching We'll have to up the ante Very good! Was it the right number of feet? Malherbe said a rhyme should also please the eye. "Trees" which carry an "s" cannot rhyme with "ante," which doesn't. The rules are tough, but useful. The French-speaking world can rest easy. Martin, we're here! Hey, Martin! Hello, Armand. - Hello, Lucette. - Hello. - You had a good trip? - Yes. - I'm beat. - Did you make a date with my lawyer? Yes, tomorrow at 10:00. You'll come? Tomorrow? No, I can't. It's probably better if I go alone, anyway. Be careful. Your landlady is an Aveyronnaise, like me. She's a money-grubber. Her name is Adrienne. Adrienne, well, well… They can kick us out whenever they like. What can we do? Didn't you almost get kicked out? Yes, but for me it's different. We get by, because we help each other out. - So do we. - But we're in social housing. We have associations who defend us. As for you, no one cares what happens to you. We're tenants like anyone else. Your problem is, you're not poor enough. - We soon will be. - Adrien is poor. - His latest film didn't work. - Nor did my earlier ones. I thought living with others was a way to avoid homelessness, but it's worse. I always used to find friends to accommodate me. I've lived here for six years. Everyone knows I live here. In any case, I now have too many possessions to move. - For me, it's really bad timing. - What about us? As you know, I'm going back to work on my film. - Is that so? - Can't you wait? That's wonderful. It's fantastic. Why didn't you tell us before? That's great news. I'm happy for you. A film so long in limbo will finally see the light of day. Our fingers are on the pulse of the creative process. I wouldn't go that far. I am the emperor and I want noodles! Francesca, what can I do? Take this. Your problem is, you're are an isolated case. - You're not a Freemason? - No. Too bad, that can help. I'd be happy to welcome you into my Masonic Lodge. - But it's in Libreville. - That's a little far. Oussamba, do you have the chili? Yes. Here. Everyone likes it hot? Dinner's ready! It's aldente, it won't wait. What's your movie about? A fantasy on the history of music hall in Paris. - We'll shoot the singing scenes here. - Can we be in it? - Yes, of course. - Can we sing our songs? - We'll see. - That's too cool! Not "too" cool. It's "so" cool. You put too many "toos" everywhere. Too, too, too! Too, too… Stop it, girls. Don't forget, we could be kicked out. Yes, but not right away. - Don't let it put us off our food. - The ritual, Adrien! Under the "eu," under the "ca" Under the "eucalyptus" Under the "euca," under the "calip" With no-one "bu-tus" - Why "no-one but us"? - We'll start again. I'm in love with "eu" And I come to "eu" with a kiss on my "lyp" Will you come with me? I'll come with you to the big eucalypt Let's go without batting an eyelid To tweet so sweet by the big eucalypt Let's go, just us To the big eucalyptus… I'm not sleepy. Traveling always upsets me. I talked so much, my voice is echoing right through my body. - What shall we watch? - I don't feel like watching a film. You don't give a fuck. You go to Florence, and I deal with the shit. - Let's not think about it now. - Do you think about it at all? - Do you think about the bailiff? - He won't come back. - We're not a priority, he'll forget. - Do you really believe that? You forget about people and think they'll forget about you. Bailiffs forget no one. It's their job. Drop the subject and they'll drop it too. It's a war of attrition. In my experience, problems go away if you ignore them long enough. In your experience? Are you kidding? - We could end up on the streets. - Come on, let's watch this. Stars in my Crown, Jacques Tourneur. It'll cheer you up. It's set in a village where everyone's nasty, until some kind of miracle makes everything wonderful. Even the Klu Klux Klan become nice guys. - We can't let the bailiff scare us. - Life is not a Jacques Tourneur movie. Okay, Minnelli. "Brigadoon, a triumph of the imagination, so much better than reality." It will do you good. It's a magical story, also set in a village. A village which no longer exists on any map. Enough of this song and dance. I have a solution. For the bailiff? No, for my morale. I'd rather you forgot your videos and took off your pajama pants. What is it? What is that? Your video's under my back. It's the Tourneur movie. Morning. - You OK? - Yes. Hello, Croquette, hello, Craquotte. I don't believe it… Hello, Croquette, hello, Craquotte. - Can't you shave? - What is this hair phobia? - It's not a phobia. - It's like a mutilation, an excision. Like Chinese women having their feet bound. Only boys have hairy armpits, it's ugly. So why is it ugly? I don't know, it's not smooth. There you go, it's not smooth. Do women have to be smooth? - Hair removal is better for the beach. - It's not better for the beach. - Do you know what that means? - I'm sure you will tell me. It's simply hatred of the female body. 19th century paintings were full of naked women. You know why they were tolerated? Because they were hairless and smooth, like children. - And things have stayed like that. - But statues don't have hair. You want to be a statue? Anyway, hair traps your sweat. So why is it that only guys are allowed to stink? It's different. What do you mean? Smell. Smell! Let's see yours… - It's just the same. - Don't say that. It's completely different. Anyway… - No hair! - Hairy! I don't need a lawyer. Fuck lawyers, fuck the law, fuck the police, fuck France. Fuck who you want, but I have to defend you. - Let me do my job. - I don't need a lawyer. I joined Al-Qaeda. Hello? Yes. Was that your fuck-buddy? What high school do you attend? I don't go to high school. Fuck high school. Then Al-Qaeda won't want you either. They only take MBAs, high-level technicians and shit-hot biologists. - For real? - Sure. There is no substitute for hard work. I have to go. See you in two weeks. And don't be late. - Hello, Oussamba. - Hi, Christine. - Your friend's not here? - She should be. Here she is. So sorry, I'm late. So, Aïssa Lafleur, Francesca Cigalone. Hello, thank you for coming. No problem, but let's get started, I don't have much time. I have an appointment at the Ministry. So, Oussamba tells me you have a rent-controlled apartment. - Do you have the lease? - Yes, here it is. It's in my grandmother's name. We've always lived there, and the rent we pay is fairly low. How low? Really low. I suppose your grandmother doesn't live alone? It's raining. She's not often there now, but my other grandmother is, and her artist friend, my sister for whom I'm legal guardian, and her friend whose parents are divorcing, and there's my daughter, our daughter. 320 square meters. That makes more sense, you've got plenty of space. - So you all live together? - Yes. There's also my daughter's friends and our friend's lovers. There must be about 18 front-door keys. I never know who'll come in next. - It's like a refuge. - A phalanstery. - That's why it's important to me. - What's the classification? 2A, 2B, 2C? 2C. - You know? - I did two years in law school. Why did you stop? The law is not my thing. I wasn't cut out for it. You're wrong. Every peaceful citizen is a potential litigant. A lawyer's job is to awaken that potential, to help people express themselves so they can even do without a lawyer in court. We have to make people realize they are inevitably victims of injustice, of whatever kind. - Is the apartment in good condition? - The whole block is badly-maintained. The owner is a very rich woman who's a real tightwad. People like that make it their job to persecute tenants. And it's our job to go after them. Be careful, they may send a bailiff to check if your grandmother lives there. Bailiffs are sick people. They enter your home, try to intimidate you, they let nothing stand in their way. I'm not sure what will get you out of this fix, apart from a miracle. I finally managed to get a date with the cheese lady. - Excuse me. - See you later. Hello? Véronique, where are you? Still in Florence? And what are you doing? Is that so? She was working as a shoe designer. She was studying shoes at the Ferragamo Museum, the greatest shoemaker of all time. So when she talked about Marilyn's curves, Marlene's shoe trees and Audrey Hepburn's romantic feet, I knew I would have to see her again. We'll drop the lawyer, I'm defending our case in court myself. It didn't work out with Oussamba's friend? We'd end up owing even more money. With the right arguments, I'll make mincemeat of our landlady. You're much too nice to do that. I did two years in law school, I even freed a crook. I don't see the connection. Well, there is one. She wants war, she's going to get it. War is legitimate for whoever needs it. And we need it. I am making war. You're not answering? It stopped. It's been doing that a lot recently. But you're right, that strategy might work. We live in community, and the soul of the community is love. The Falingards live in society, and society's soul is the law. That's what you have to get into the judge's head. Can you really see me saying that to the judge? Of course! It's an old Rossellini trick. And Rossellini's not to be sniffed at. Working hard? - Here? Yes, that's good. - Great. We have to tidy up the kitchen. Francesca yelled at me. - It's not my turn. - Nor mine. Have a good day at school. You'll find their weak spot, Francesca. To defeat your enemy, you must become your enemy. Thank you. - It's my choreographer. - I'd better go and open the store. - You'll let yourself out? - Yes. - Morning, Mr. Cigalone. - Hello, Ms…. - A dancer? I'll call you back. - That's the cheese lady? - Yes. - Ms. Mascarpone? I love women when they're sitting in front a pile of food. - Any kind of food? - All kinds. - What's this? - It's a hard-earned wheel of comté cheese. You're hiding it so no one can eat it? Not at all, it's a gift. Off we go… That's it. Falingard versus Ardilouze. Can you move to the left, please? Your lawyer isn't here? Your Honor, I will be defending the case myself. As is your right. I see that you are alone again. I am surprised that Mrs. Ardilouze, the lead tenant, is not present. The phantom grandmother. She is the lead tenant on the lease for this rent-controlled apartment. My grandmother, I mean Marie-Antoinette Ardilouze, is… Yes? Mrs. Ardilouze had a serious illness. She is convalescing on the advice of her doctors. I would remind the court that she is an elderly lady in fragile health. She's been on her deathbed for 50 years, your Honor. Why does Mrs. Falingard wish to take back this apartment? Not to live there herself, but to rent it out at an exorbitant price. At a current rental price. And what is a current rental price? An excessively high rent resulting from property speculation. It's a very serious problem for everyone in this city, your Honor. Who gave Paris its reputation? The impoverished painters, sculptors and writers from around the world who took refuge in low-income neighborhoods, Montmartre, Montparnasse, Saint-Germain-des-Prés. I eat a jerk-off leftist scribbler every morning for breakfast. Careful, that sounds like a literary criticism. Times have changed. St-Germain-des-Prés is known for fashion and design. - And luxury boutiques. - Exactly. That's what I'm saying. Rent rises are why bookstores, cinemas and theaters have disappeared, to be replaced by clothes shops. - We must clothe the naked. - The clothes are hardly given away. We are straying from the debate. Has the rent always been paid regularly? Always, your Honor. But could we have done so if Mrs. Falingard had quintupled the rent? Here we go again! In addition to our apartment, this landlady also possesses… Francesca had really done her homework. She listed Falingard's properties off by heart, from the Côte d'Azur villa to the Alpine ski chalet, not forgetting the Normandy farmhouses, the Tuscan vineyard, seaside apartments in Brittany, a hunting lodge on the Loire and of course the maid's rooms rented to penniless students. 540 euros a month for one room, your Honor. 540 euros a month! Coming! Just a second. My God! What's going on? I was afraid. I've been ringing for ages. - I thought you were dead. - But why? I thought maybe carbon dioxide poisoning. - We have central heating. - Thank God! - What happened in court? - Judgment postponed. - So we'll be OK for a little while? - Two weeks. I'm going to start my rehearsals right away. What's all this about a court case? You aren't going to jail? What's wrong, Annette? - What's the matter? - She's like that. My little sister sees only doom and gloom, and always has done. If you're sleeping, you must be dead, a noise in the house at night is a thief, a ghost, an axe-murderer. If everyone's happy then it won't last, something terrible is bound to happen. Next time, before we go out, we'll put a note on the door saying, "We are not dead." - Look at what he wrote. - Who? Hermann. He's gone away. He left me a note. Tell me what you think. "You will always be the first in my heart and the last I should have met." What does he mean? - It's not very clear. - It's always complex when love's involved. It's quite simple. He wants to get rid of me. He takes me for a prostitute. I'm not a prostitute! Of course not, you're just a little depressed. I want to die. That's good. I don't know why I exist. Very good. I always make everyone unhappy, anyway. - Excellent. - What are you saying? She needs to express herself, speak her sorrow out loud. Put it into words, sweetheart, that's excellent. Annette is back. What does Hermann do? - He makes documentaries for Arte TV. - He's German? He lives in Munich but he has a Spanish accent. How can someone from Munich have a Spanish accent? He was born in Holland. Obviously. A dab of polish… He's working on a documentary about a Merovingian cemetery where the skeletons bear marks of dreadful torture. He's covered the famine in Ukraine, trouble in Romania, pollution in the Caspian Sea, alcoholism among the Inuit, organ trafficking in the favelas, and of course the extermination of protected species. Of course, it's for Arte. - You don't like his job? - On the contrary, I love it. So what's he unhappy about? He says I have too many dark thoughts. - What is it? - You have it! LA MORT You're very sensitive, you're upset. Has he tried to make you feel more relaxed and confident about the relationship? Yes. He took me to Brindisi to see a boat-load of illegal Albanians. Superb documentary. Superb. I was so happy, I wanted to die. It scared him away. You must forget Hermann. He wasn't right for you. - Already? - Daddy? Tell me the story you didn't tell me yesterday. - What? Which story? - The same one. Once upon a time there was a fairy and a wizard… You're still in bed! Francesca, can you lend me your red sweater? Yes… What time is it? You're all in here, I was looking for you. It's a beautiful day, we should go on a round-the-world trip. Adrien, someone's come to see you. - He's in here. - Just a moment. - What have we got? - Double bass, piano, guitar and accordion. Can we have a violin? - Also unpaid? - Of course. I do not know The price of things Probably just as well - Is it in the movie? - No, the film's lighthearted. Nothing controversial. I'll show you what we've done so far. Not so loud, you silly geese, we have work to do! - So the lease is terminated but… - Francesca! - Where are you going? - To see Lucas. Want to eat with us? - We'll be seven or eight. - Can you bring bread? OK, don't worry. Love you! - So the lease? - It's terminated, but the tenant can remain as an occupant in good faith. Look. "Occupation of the property must be real and continuous." Which means? Grandmother is allowed to stay as an occupant in good faith. She has to spend more time in the apartment with us. - And no sub-letting. - No sub-letting. No. So that means we're staying? Bravo. - It doesn't affect me, I don't pay rent. - We know that. But the property can't be used professionally. I'm a craftsman, not a professional. I'm above all that. I want to finish my film. - So, girls, the choreographer… - Paul, that job? A conspiracy of the mediocre, as ever. They scratch each others' backs and leave you out in the cold. Would you be interested in a part in my next movie? That depends. That depends. How many lines? One, two and one, two, three, four… Wait, I have a present for you. That's too much, you shouldn't have. You earned it. Martin! Meet Amandine, she's a market gardener. Hi, Martin, please to meet you. I have to run. I have to go. Bye! Ciao. - One more? - Look at what she gave me. Hello? That could be tricky, I have a lot of dubbing to do. I'm on set with the actors. It's not very convenient. Shall I call you back? Yes, I'll call you. OK. - Where do I put this? - At the back. That's it. - Léon, we have all the panels? - Yes, eight of them. What are you doing? - What's all this? - It's the set. - That's too cool. - Give us a hand, girls. Go ahead, at the back. That's it. So… My baskets. - Léon? - That tune… It reminds me of an operetta that I saw at Châtelet. - Really? - Yes. I'm worried, I can't find the basket with red ribbons. You mean that one? No red ribbons. What an idiot! I forgot it. But that's the basket with the cancan dresses. The Moulin Rouge or Moulin de la Galette without dancing girls won't wash. Martin… It's stupid, but you're still in my thoughts. I even see you everywhere. As soon as you are in Paris, call me. Great. - Who was it? - No caller ID. Annette, what can you sing for me? - A little song… - Yes? - A Serbian folk song. - Fine. - So you start and I'll follow. - OK. What's happening here? It reminds me of the trip to Brindisi with Hermann. Adrien… I know you prefer amateurs over professional actors. But is it a good idea to hire my sister? Especially while she's in this state. How can you say that, Martin? After what happened to me? You're not my brother, you're a dog! - You hurt me! - It's OK. Stay calm, I'll be back in a moment. Martin, please. I've been your house guest four or five years, I have my office, my editing table. I bring my girlfriends. - Yes. - Bed and board, right? I invade your space. I put up with your mess. I have to put up with bailiffs coming in, trying to seize everything. I can be totally fine with that. But I would never forgive you, it would be the end of our friendship, which might even force me to leave, if you intervene one more time, just one more time, in my creative process. Lovely. Everything OK? Hi Laura, are you OK? That's lovely too. Sorry. Hello, it's over there. Catherine. - Have the girls arrived? - Everyone's here. - Francesca, where are you going? - To my room. That's make-up and hair. - The kitchen, then. - No, that's lighting and sound. - In my little office. - Fine. OK. My basket, my beautiful basket! Come in, Léon. Good. Can you open it? There we are. That's it, perfect. Ladies, come and choose your costumes. Zaza, Clara, Camilla, Capsula, Barbara, come on! Not that, leave that. That's it. - I've worked night and day. - That's better. I'm warning you! On set, I'm like Louis XIV at Versailles. - Is he very severe? - He has to be. What are you doing here, Josephine? Paul? That's it. - Ready to roll? - No problem. Music. Let's go. He's changed the tune. No wonder he's off key. He's lost the tune. You've changed the tune? Once I'm in it, I can't hear the music. I hear only one sound and it's mine. - You have sung before? - Yes. In Mongolia, particularly. In yurts. OK. Well, carry on. This is just for starters. I'll refine it later. Don't overdo it. Music! I didn't move. Paul, you can just do it like this, prosper, yop la boum… Pull up your pants but don't move your legs or your shoulders. Music. What are you doing, Annette? I'm here to play the hooker. It was good fun, but I couldn't stand the noise. Véronique had come back. It was a good reason to give in to the temptation of seeing her again. - I'm bored. - Otherwise, it wouldn't be any fun. If you don't need me, I'll leave. I don't like to doing nothing. - You'll do the boom. - What's that? Take this, that's it. When we're shooting, you hold it like that. Step back. Like that. - It's not rocket science. - Girls, you're warmed up, so stand up. Up you get. That's it. OK, rehearsal. Get into the wings. - You here and you there… - The wings? Yes, in the wings. You go there and you over there. OK. - What are you doing, Léon? - Booming. It's not for me. Get back over there. Only when we're shooting. OK, rehearsal! - Music! - One, two. - So what's up? - There's no room. - What about the splits? - There isn't enough room. They can do it down here, in front of the stage. Start from the end of the corridor, girls. Quickly! Get back in position. - I'm bored, Adrien. - You can be clapper loader. Get out of shot, girls. Go on. Out of the way, everyone. Let's go. Together, OK? - Let's go. Camera! - Rolling! Where's the slate? Does Paris Sing?66 of 16, take two. - Music. - One, two, three, four. Wait, stop. Why are you squatting? You don't squat to do the splits. From the top. First positions. Come on, first positions. - Camera. - Rolling. Slate. Does Paris Sing?66 of 16, take three. What are you clowns doing? Get out of shot! - Music. - One, two, three, four. Thank you. Give me the small camera, I'm going to enjoy myself. I'll do the cutaways. Thank you, ladies, that was lovely. I'll take that. That's it. There. Positions. There we are. And so we meet again, old friend. OK, music! - Stand by. Camera! - Rolling. Slate! Does Paris Sing?, 68 of 3, take one. - I wasn't ready. - Where were you? - I'm good now. - Second clapper. Does Paris Sing?, 68 out of 3, take one. Give it all you got, girls. Music! Who the hell is this idiot? Mr. Blavache, bailiff. I'm here with the receiver to confiscate on behalf of Cofico, Mr. Cigalone's furniture and objects. The objects belong to Mrs. Ardilouze. Of course. Do you have the receipts? - You're a comedian. - That's not what most people call me. - And you are? - A friend of the family. A guest of Mrs. Ardilouze. I told you. All these people are also Mrs. Ardilouze's house guests? The property is not used solely as a private dwelling. Let's proceed with the removal. - We have a piano there. - But it's a work tool. - You don't have the right. - I know my job. There's also a computer, two armchairs and a coffee table. - Let's find them. - Here's a computer. Hang on, what are you doing with my computer? - That's mine! Put it back! - Miss, please… - We'll beat the crap out of you! - Put it down, Miss… Stop this! Give it back! Give it back to me right away! - Mr. Receiver! - You big bully! Help! - Cut the pig's throat! - Music! I sometimes wonder, is this real or am I dreaming? Enough! Stop! The law does not take revenge! I just wanted to… Cut. Damn it, Adrien, you're fucking unbelievable! - Francesca… - It's ridiculous! Can't you see the danger you got us into? The ruling said, "must not be used for professional purposes." - I didn't know! - You turn the apartment into a movie set! There'll be no more cameras, no more dancers, it's over! OK. OK, I quit. Poetry and… Poetry and real estate don't mix. So there's no more movie, no more songs, nothing? Francesca is a bad girl! Silence! Francesca! Recite your poem. I'm waiting to be grown-up There's no hurry Everything comes right And when I hear The hour strike The bells will say… I do it all the time. Where do you go, so early in the morning? In the van, with the vegetables? At the Rapid Hotel, behind Saint Séverin, it used to be The Alpine. Of course! I'd forgotten that one. Véronique, it's Martin. I have some time this afternoon, let's meet at the Rapid Hotel at 3:00 pm. It's a very good hotel. There's a red awning and a big aquarium in the entrance. I can't hear you. Say something. I don't know what to say, Martin. She hung up on you? Wrong number. I just called Francesca. Sometimes I wonder why people can't bear the idea of being dead. What an asshole! What an asshole. Asshole. Call her and say it was a joke. Go on. Laugh, don't sound guilty. You do it. I don't want to get involved. Adrien! - Adrien! - No! It's over. I've lost Francesca. And I didn't get… What was her name again? Yes, Véronique. I fell out with both of them. Congratulations, Martin, well played. Why did I allow that madwoman to pick me up? I've always been a lapdog, I come when I'm called. Francesca will never forgive me, I know her. What will become of me? Who'll take care of the bank, the rent, of Isabelle, of the apartment? Social Security, I can't even fill in the forms, I'm useless. And I'm selfish, I only think about myself. I'm worse than Adrien. He has a strategy. He knows what he's doing. Have you forgotten everything? I lied once, I cannot lie any more. All your fine speeches were just lies. We will do the rest. Take them and lock them up together. - That's it. - Together? - You're generous. - Such true love must be encouraged. The only love I knew was just a lie. My love, I want you and your wife to have a new honeymoon. It won't last long. The best things in life are short and sweet. Like the few days we spent together. - I beg you, have mercy. - Too late. Much too late. So kill us, get it over with. No, I want you to watch her burning in the sun, see her tongue turn black, see her eyes change and reflect only an air of madness. Let her slit her wrists and drink her own blood. You alone are capable of such ignominy. The men who shared your life, however villainous, even Blackbeard wouldn't be so abject. I am Captain Providence. Treat us as Blackbeard would have. Kill us with a bullet. You like to play at being a man. - So act like a man. - I'm a woman… as you often remind me. You should have thought of that when you betrayed me. By leaving you here, I know your last thought will be for me. You're crying? It upset you, then? We'll do another one. There was too much emotion. - Mrs. Cigalone, hello. - Hello. Hello. I'll be back in two minutes. Can you wait for me in the classroom? Thank you. She must have forgotten. I'll show you where it is. There are days when you just want a refund on your own life. It's not that bad. I met her in Florence. It didn't mean anything. Florence. You wanted me to sew the lining of your jacket. I don't know what got into me. I was alone. I felt like you were mad at me. This girl jumped on me. I didn't want to. All I could think of was you. You think about me when you fuck your bitches? I was bewitched. It happens. He was bewitched! Listen to that. I don't believe it. Is that all you can say, you pathetic schmuck? Don't you have any imagination? The films you watch, the books you read, don't they teach you anything, you moron? It was nothing. I love only you. So what were you two doing at the Rapid Hotel? - She was blackmailing me. - It's so nice to see parents like you. Honestly, some parents are just awful. Isabelle's family life is obviously loving and harmonious. Family is so important for keeping children balanced. - Come with me. - You disgust me. School can only do so much. Children need the framework that a happy home provides. Let's get out of the torture chamber. Run for your life! She's angry. I'm sure she'll blame me. Why did I tell Martin about that hotel? I was showing off. Francesca will think I'm a bad influence. Women are often like that. They think their man is led astray by his pals. That way, they can forgive him. I'm taking Isabelle to her art class. I have something to do tonight. - Get McDonald's for everyone. - That gives me indigestion. What about mashed potato and leftover sausages? What exactly do you take me for? I'm sick of you doing fuck all except failing to finish crap movies and collecting dumb girlfriends. Sick of that fruitcake singing out of tune! I'm sick of you, Martin. What you did in Florence was pathetic. I'll never forgive you. I faced the bailiff alone! You're stupid and pretentious, that's what bothers me most. It's not, what's her name, again? - What did you say on the phone? - I don't know. Yes, Véronique! That's what I am, a puppet, a clown. I did everything I could to keep a roof over your heads! So did I. If you think I'll carry on like before, you're wrong. I'm outta here! You can get by on your own! Victoria, take care of the little one. What if I made spaghetti with bacon? It's just an unfortunate mishap. Remember this advice from your grandmother, husbands are simply pets. So why put them out? Where would they go, poor little beasts? That's what I said to your grandfather. It made him laugh. Why not take a lover? My generation is less daring than yours. I'm like the Princess of Cleves. I choose not to have an affair, not out of loyalty or duty, but to preserve my inner peace. You youngsters have no blood in your veins. True fidelity is that of the heart. You still know how to make applesauce? The one you taught me, yes. Applesauce is a good cure for marriage problems. It takes your mind off things, it's soothing and refreshing. Applesauce saved my relationship with your grandfather. He was some piece of work, that one. Nothing like Martin. If it wasn't for applesauce, you wouldn't be here. Isabelle, Agathe, let's go! Put your satchels on, that's it. OK, come on. - We're in a hurry, girls. - Bye, Daddy! Have a good day! Have a good art class! Adrien? What? What if she never comes back? She left, so she's bound to come back. I'll send her a text message to say that we're worried. Not yet! Never disturb a woman while she's relishing her anger. You should write her a letter. What would I write? Wait, I'll be right back. Here's one I wrote to a Swedish woman I lived with for a year. She went to her mother's. - You keep copies? - Yes, listen. "When one person is missing, the world is full of her." - The world is empty. - This is my version. Anything else? Anything else… Maybe this one. I sent it to a very jealous Chinese woman. "When I get close to a woman, your image overwhelms me, and an irresistible force brings me back to you." Ridiculous. Francesca would die laughing. It's grotesque. That's exactly what Hermann wrote to me. I found it grotesque. See? Even Annette doesn't believe it. I'll get it! - Morning! - Hello, Miss. You're new. Yes, I've a registered letter for you. - Who is it? - A registered letter. What do I do? Sign it! Thank you. This is for you. Have a good day! That's it, thank you. A registered letter for Marie-Antoinette. - Must be the court summons. - And still no grandmother. Lord help me! I don't need this. I can walk perfectly well. I can even dance. I danced in your movie! You're Marie-Antoinette. I was scared. I wondered if it was a good idea of Adrien's to try to pass off Josephine, who was increasingly crazy, for Marie-Antoinette. Madame Falingard was staring. I was sure she'd recognized her. It's no good! She recognized her! My name's Josephine and I want… I'll create a diversion. Adrienne, I'm Adrien. We had to meet. Madam, if your heart is as hard as your ass, we are lost. No, don't do that. Come with me. She loved it! Loved it. Are you all right, my dear? - Why did you do that? - I don't know. I couldn't resist. What now? I'll throw myself at the judge's feet, tell her it's all my fault. It won't be easy. She won't listen to you. She'll listen to me. She'll listen to me. Your Honor, it wasn't professional usage, it was a meeting to prepare a birthday party. But you were using cameras, professional equipment, as we can see in these photographs. Those are trick photos! Who are the people under our roof? A filmmaker fighting for justice, big kids taking refuge from a harsh world, grandmothers rescued from hospital, or from care-homes. I am the emperor… Francesca surprised us more than ever. She managed to get our expulsion postponed to the following spring. You'll be fine here. I prepared a mattress for you. Thanks to this apartment, we can split up without separating. It's not a very cheerful room. If we had a three-room apartment, you'd be sleeping outside. Shall I tuck you in? Very funny. OK. Well… I'll leave you to it. And life went on. Mama Oussamba and Mrs. Falingard waged war with witchcraft. The salad days were over. Armand and Lucette, whose private life was usually as impenetrable as their cash-register, told us a secret. Armand and I stayed together mainly because of the bistro. For an Auvergnat, that's as close to love as it gets. Not answering? Hello? You have the wrong number, madam. - Is it her? - What? Hello? Yes, hello. Francesca Cigalone. Are you Véronique? It would be good to talk. A rival is a woman you want to strangle. I don't want to strangle her, so she's not my rival. So Martin didn't cheat on me, but he intended to, and in adultery, it's the thought that counts. Are you really attached to Martin or is it just a pastime? - He's charming. - I know, that's why I married him. Charming and useless. A love match is when you marry someone who's no use to you. You're right. Men don't wear well over time, they shrink. Marriage should be based on rational criteria determined by specialists. How do you deal with Martin's lies? Stay, Martin. I gave it a lot of thought. I can deal with lies, but something about him bothers me. You know what it is about Martin that I couldn't handle? He's not a happy liar but a guilty one. He not only lies, he's unhappy about lying. He resents us when we pretend to believe him. - It's weird. - Not really, if you think about it. Martin thinks that if we believe his lies, it's because we don't love him enough. He wants us to believe, but he's angry when we do. It's hopeless. He misses his mom. She always knew when he was lying. A lot of men are like that. Aren't they, Martin? They put me through this dozens of times until Véronique finally agreed to go away. They gave me such a hard time, and had such a ball doing it, they called it "Martin ping-pong." Where's Daddy? He's very tired because he worked a lot. He's in a place where he can sleep. Where there's no noise. Is he coming with us? We'll see tomorrow. We'll see tomorrow. But will he really be with us? Martin lands, flies away, comes back and then leaves. He's flighty, because he's a bird. I married a bird and I am not a cage. Tomorrow we'll be at the seaside. That's enough gate-keeping. Let's see what happens. "Order to vacate the premises, at the request of Mrs. Falingard, addressed to Mrs. Ardilouze." "You are required by order to evacuate all persons and possessions from the apartment within two months of today." Two months. Not bad. Not bad at all. You are ordered to evacuate the apartment within two months. I'm sizzling hot! Take me right now! You bastard, you make me mad! - You want more? - Yes! Yes! - Again? - Yes. - On one condition. - What? What? What condition? You slut! You will sign a lease giving them an eight-year exemption. You'll sign it! Yes! Anything you want! Eight years. And not one year less! That's so good! - Again? - No problem. But it'll cost you one more year. However many you want. I'm going to catch you! - Come on! - You didn't catch me! Thanks. I think we should sit here. Eight years, not one less! Nine years, not one more! Eight years, not one less! Nine years, not one more! - It's a miracle. - No, it's a whim. The whim of a woman, a whim of fate. Fate is more fickle than a woman's heart. So we have a reprieve. But it's weaker than a court order. It will only last as long as her appetite for Adrien. It's far from satisfied, I can assure you. Is the tablecloth laid? Come on. That's it. Here's the wine, you can open it. Adrien, the sea makes me feel happy and sad. - It makes me feel hungry. - Me too. - Let's cook the sardines. - You're cooking them? - Yes. - That'll take forever. Good food doesn't happen in ten seconds. I do things properly. That's not a concept you're familiar with. What I enjoy most is playing deaf. I make people repeat things. Especially compliments. - I'm hungry! - We're hungry! I'm bored. We could drown ourselves in the open sea like White Mane. - Or we could slit our wrists and… - Annette, stop it! I can't help it! When I'm in love, I want to die! No… So where were we? The whims of women. - If you're worried, I can go into detail. - No! We trust you. Have a drink. We are in the hands of fate. Let's make the most of this respite that allows us to stay together. Don't worry. Worrying brings bad luck. That smells good! Dinner's ready! Sardines! Lovely sardines! Careful, it's very hot. But it's delicious. There we are. In 1948, in the exhilaration of newly-regained freedom, the French parliament passed the only just law in the real estate jungle. It has gone down in history as "the law of 48." By capping the rents paid on older apartments, it allowed families to stay together and to welcome friends in need, in short, hospitality. Even poor people had the luxury of space, a situation which the speculators couldn't allow to continue. It's the story of a group of carefree people who'd forgotten that money will always try to take back control. Subtitle translation by: Lucie Maguire
