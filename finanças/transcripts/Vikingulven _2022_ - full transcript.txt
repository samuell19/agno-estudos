NETFLIX PRESENTS So the saga goes... In 1050, Viking chieftain Gudbrand the Grim set out with 20 ships to plunder Normandy. In an abbey, they discovered a secret room. The monks begged Gudbrand not to enter. The Vikings found neither gold nor silver. None of them understood that they had released the hound of hell. It came along as they sailed home. Before the ship reached Norway, all the Vikings were dead. The dog leaped ashore. And thus, evil found its way deep into the Nordic woods. Nearly 1,000 years later... NYBO MUNICIPALITY - Popcorn? - Oh, yum. Oh, my God. It's chocolate. JONAS: ARE YOU COMING TO THE BAY? Can I come, too? Not now. I'm going with some friends from school. Arthur? I'm gonna meet up with some friends from school. - OK. - Yep. Thale? - Yeah? - Erm... You could call me dad or father if it feels... - But you're not my dad, Arthur. So... - No... You need... a ride? Hey. - Where are you going? - I'm meeting some friends from school. Which ones? - You don't know them anyway, so... - Okay, so where will you be? Arthur said it was fine. - Be home by 11. - Maybe! POLICE ACADEMY You came? Yeah. Well, you asked me to, so... That's awesome. Thought I'd give you a little tour of Nybo. - Check out the attractions. - Attractions? Yeah, so this is the Bay. Oh... Kind of confusing that the bay is called the Bay. This beach is actually called the Beach, and it's in the bay Bay. But the town isn't called Town. We have a dog named Dog, actually. - Seriously? - Yeah. That's fucking insane. You'll fit right in. Take a seat. Do you like it in Nybo? Erm, yeah. It's a little boring, but it can only get better, so... - You're an optimist. I like it. - You like what? Hey. I was just telling Thale about our lovely town. So, that's the weirdo from Oslo. Yeah, I heard something about drugs and stuff. What's that about? I... I killed someone. Okay... Cool. - Isn't your mom a cop? - Yeah. You won't tell your mom about this, right? Erm, no. Jonas? You think we could talk for a bit? - Now? - Yeah. - Er... - Come on. - Sure. I... I guess we can. Sorry. - What's she gonna talk to him about? Something you could only dream of, Vidar. Shut up. I'll toss you in the middle of the lake, man. - You can try. - Do you want me to try? - No, I don't think so. - That's what I thought. Fucking hell. Can't you tell us about that murder then, T? No, I... Where are you going? To spy on them? Or are you gonna kill someone? I'm gonna kill you. Wow. Holy shit. Good night. You know... Did you notice that there's a six-pack missing from the fridge? Are we out? I can get more tomorrow after work. No, I mean... Oh, cut Thale some slack. Besides, my shoulders need a massage, since you don't help around the house. It's 'cause I'm really busy, you know. - Ah. - Mm. I just think it's nice that there's someone new in town. All I'm asking is if you could please tell me the next time you bring someone. Sure, I will, but I really don't want to. Elin? Are you... I'll just... Andersen? Close the area down by the river! Excuse me. Hi. I'm from the local paper. - Could I ask you ask some questions? - No. There you are, Berg. Hey! I told you to keep away from here! - Can't I just get a short statement? - Come on, we've got a situation here. A girl's missing. Elin Gran. She's the mayor's daughter, so that won't be fun. Right now we're securing the area, and then we'll start the search. The boy's in shock, not doubt about that. He's not making any sense. - Your daughter's here too. - Excuse me? - Your daughter is here. - Oh, my God. She's okay. But we need to talk to her. I think you should do it. - Is she here? - She's over there. Oh, my God, sweetheart. Sweetheart. Are... Are you hurt? Are you hurt? What happened? - It's not my blood. - It's not your blood? - I was in the woods. - You were in the woods? What happened? Sweetheart, you have to tell me. What happened there? Sweetheart, you have to... Try. I don't know. Liv? Come and have a look at this! Over here! We need people to secure this area. We've found a phone with blood on it. We need a photographer... We need the whole works. Okay. Erm... Well... You, stand guard here. Not a soul comes through here. Hansen, grab the barrier tape. What are you doing, Berg? What in God's name is that? Are you okay? I'm fine. Did you... find her? Elin? No, but there's lots of people searching. Sweetheart, what really happened yesterday? I... I don't... I don't know. Well, actually I saw Elin... She got knocked down. Then I tripped and got the wind knocked out of me. And then I turned around and... Elin was just lying there. And here was blood everywhere. Did you see what it was? No, I... don't know. Yeah. Okay. NYBO HIGH SCHOOL It's important to take care of each other in situations like these. So don't sit at home by yourself if something is bothering you. But speak with your friends or parents, so that... And try and look out for each other so no one feels excluded or lonely. Hmm? I know that many of you were very fond of Elin. She was an outgoing and well-liked young woman. That being said, we would like to talk to those of you who were at the Bay that evening. We'll be calling each of you in for a little chat. Great. Thank you. POLICE Erm... We'd... We'd been drinking. But not... We weren't drunk. And then Elin wanted to talk. What did she want to talk about? I don't know. We never got that far. Where were you, then? I was in the woods. On the... beach. Okay... Were you there alone or with someone? I was alone. Did you see or hear anything there? No, I was, erm, a little bit busy making out with Siri. Are you a couple? - No. - No? But you've been friends for a while? Mm-hmm. You heard a sound? What kind of sound? H... Howling screams, I guess. But you... You knew it was Elin who screamed? Yeah. Er... It was all chaotic and stuff. What did you see when you got there? It was really dark, so I couldn't see anything. So you didn't see what it was? No, I don't know. Maybe an animal. Well, could it have been a wolf? That's all I... I don't... I don't know. I don't know. - Do you think about him? - What? Do you even miss him at all? - It's complicated. We tried to... - Yes or no? - I don't think it's as simple as... - Okay, fine. No, but sweetheart, I want you... Stop, listen. I... I worked hard to have a good relationship with your father. I really tried, even when he got sick. Let's just forget it. WOLF ANATOMY - Yes, this is Eilert. - Hi, it's Liv. Eilert, I think we should send out a hunting party if there's actually a wolf in the forest. I understand that you're eager, but we have to do things by the book. We can't just go hunting wolves before we know for sure that a wolf took Elin. Yes, but Eilert, if there's a wolf loose in the forest... There is no "but." This isn't Oslo. We have other concerns. Local concerns. Okay. - Good. - Good. Fuck. Hi. Dinner. - What? What did you say? - Dinner's ready. Come on. - Dinner time. - I'm not hungry. - Come on down if you get hungry, then. - Okay. I've locked my keys in the car again. Could you do that police trick? Of course. Berg. - Hi. It's Eilert. - Hi, Eilert. Erm... Okay. Yes. Er... No, I'll be right over. - We're going to the coroners now. - Fine. - Okay? - Bye. - What? - Hmm? Is it Elin? She was found one and a half miles from the scene. And, erm, there are very large claw and bite marks on her neck. The right arm has been ripped off below the elbow. With massive tissue loss. Yeah. On the right side, there's a big piece that's just gone. Large abrasions on the behind, thighs and legs, which suggests that the body was dragged across the ground for a long time. Berg, you can... You take this. I... I need some air. I'll be back. So, er... I'm not sure this is wolf. It doesn't seem right. My brother's a farmer in Østerdalen, and I... Well, I've seen some of the animals that the wolves have attacked. I mean... Those wounds were nothing like this. Call this guy. He's Norway's leading expert on predators. Thanks. - It's not a good idea for you to see her. - I need to see her. She's the victim of a crime. Yes, I understand. - She wants to see her daughter. - No, wait, erm... The doctor isn't done examining her, so unfortunately I can't let you in... What are you trying to tell me? Are you not going to let me see my daughter? Eilert? I'm afraid Berg's right. I'm so sorry. Your daughter, wasn't she there too? - Yeah. - Exactly. - It could have been her. - I know. It could have been her. It could have been any of them, but it's my Elin lying there. I want to see her... I'm sorry, but they have to finish the technical... I don't know if I can go on without her. I don't know. I want you to promise me that you'll do whatever it takes to catch who did this. Thale? Thale! NORWEGIAN SCHOOL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE Okay, that's all for today. Listen, William... How's... How's your schedule looking? What do you need? Well, I just received an unusual request from the sheriff's office in Nybo, Telemark. They think they have a wolf that's attacked and killed a local teenager. - Wolves don't kill humans. - No, exactly. And that is why they want me to send an expert who can determine if it is a wolf. Would you be interested in that? Absolutely. I'll just finish up here and clear up my schedule. Excellent. I will let them know. JONAS: CAN WE TALK? POLICE Hello there. My name is Lars Brodin, and I need to speak with the chief of police. It's about the murder of Elin Gran. You haven't worked here for long, have you? - That's right, I'm from Sweden. - Oh. And you? From Norway, Sweden... From Finland... Er... You said you had information about... Elin Gran. Is the deputy familiar with the term "lycanthrope"? That's what we... you are looking for. And how would you know what it is we're looking for? Because I've been hunting this thing almost my entire life. This thing... A wolf. A werewolf. A werewolf? I see what you're thinking. And this is the unthinkable. But trust me. Trust me when I say that it is a bloodthirsty monster you're chasing, that must be stopped before the infection spreads. The bloodline must be broken. Okay, I don't know what you think you're doing, but this is truly disrespectful. A young girl is dead. And you come here and waste my time, and talk about werewolves and ancient stories. The werewolf running wild here in Nybo, it is not just a story, my good Deputy Berg. Okay... - We're done here. - Fine. I'll be at the camping ground, should you need help with the hunt. I'll stay there until the beast is killed. To give you a piece of advice, look for a place where the wolf can hide. A cave, a hole, for example. Is the 9mm Heckler & Koch still your service weapon? Yes, that is the weapon for Norwegian police. Hmm. This... This is the only thing that will stop the beast. Have a nice day. Sorry I haven't... answered your texts and stuff. It's just... I should be the one saying sorry, for dragging you into this. No. It's really no one's fault, what happened to Elin. We can't... I keep seeing it. When I close my eyes. Yeah, me too. I just want this to be over. I'm... I'm a wreck... at the moment, it's... I mean, I... I just want to scream out loud and run far away and just... I want to get out of here. You're not a wreck, you're just naturally weird. Wanna leave? I'm just gonna pay. - Just crazy. - Definitely. Damn... She's just so damn clingy. - Hey, T. What's up? - Hi. Could you maybe stop calling me that? - Is it true what people are saying? - What do you mean? That you could've saved Elin, but you ran away. - Mm... Who's saying that? - Just people, you know. Holy fuck, check this out! Fuck, what's up with your shoulder? That wound is infected. Do you have rabies or what? - Unbelievable. - Fuck, that's nasty. - What's going on? - Oh, hey. I was just joking about her having rabies. Hello? Occupied. Occupied! - I said it's occupied! What is it? - How are you? I just want to ask you how you were. I was thinking about what we talked about in the car, and... Oh, my God... - Stop! Stop! Stop! - But we need to get it checked out. I'm all right. It's fine. Listen, we are trying here. We'll see how it turns out. That's why we came here, to have a fresh start, kind of. Do you understand? No, not really. You're fucking joking, right? - But... - We moved to Nybo, Mom! Dad had to die before you actually wanted to be there for me. Don't talk to me like that. Don't do that. You know nothing about that. Okay? - Let me see now. - No, don't. - Thale, we have to. - Cut it out. Stop! Thale, wait... Listen... I'm so sorry. Oh, okay... Oh, fuck. - Are you okay? - Yeah... Yes.I'm... - You sure? - Er... I'm good. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. Okay... Listen, I want to say that Vidar... That he's an asshole. That I... feel I should've punched him or something. I mean it, I should've punched him. I could take him. - The left cupboard. - I'm looking there now. Yeah... The top shelf. - Listen... I usually put it in the hallway. - I'll have to call you back. Hi, I'm looking for Liv Berg. - I'm the veterinarian. - Oh, I remember. Just a second. Liv? The veterinarian is here. The thing here is that all the bite marks are from the same animal. So it's one animal, one large animal, that did all this. Yes, we found a claw... at the scene. May I see? You see, these bite marks are bigger than a normal wolf. But... Hmm... I wonder... Hm. It's definitely a wolf claw, and it fits the wounds. But unusually long for a wolf claw. But you're sure that it's a wolf? No doubt. Okay, I'll get that hunting permit. Alright, guys. Elin Gran disappeared from here, where the barrier tapes are. And we found the body here. Gjerstadlia, one and a half miles into the forest. I suggest that we start there, establish first position. - Okay, let's go. - It's rugged terrain, quite dense. - Blystad? - Yeah? - Try to conserve your energy. - Yes, we know. So, Police Officer Berg... Have you done much hunting? What? No. Never for... Never for animals. Ha! "Never for animals." That's a good one. Come on, Mira. You don't have to worry. This wolf is shot and skinned already. Just keep close to me and you'll be fine. Brynjar? Won't you give me a heads-up when you see the wolf so I can get a good shot for the front page. Make sure you get my good side. The Fenris wolf, or "Fenrisúlfr," which is the original name, was a terrifying and huge wolf in Norse mythology. It is the son of Loki and the giantess Angerboda, who also parented the Midgard Serpent and Hel. The Aesir learn that all three children will be raised in Jotunheim, and they foresee that they will cause... ...a lot of damage and disaster... What? Excuse me? Odin throws the serpent into the ocean... Thale? Come on. This way. - What is it? - She's picked up a scent. Okay, erm... It's an... asylum seeker. Government papers. Eilert. Eilert, are you okay? The dog is picking up something. Eilert? You're the sheriff. Get it together. You have to do it. Okay, erm... Andersen and Blystad, you stay here and guard the body. The rest will check out what Mira has found. We need more people. But until they arrive, you stay here and guard the body. If you see a wolf, shoot it. Okay? Come on. Good girl, come on. Hello? You okay? Hello? It's your fault, Thale. Why did you let me die? Why did you let me die?! It's one of the air shafts for the old copper mine. Back in the day, the mine used to be full of activity, but now it's closed. Shouldn't someone go and check inside? I'll do it. What in God's name is that? Do you hear that? Come on! Come here! Are you hearing what I'm hearing? We can't stay here. We can't panic now. We'll wait here, like the police told us. The police said... Andersen? Andersen, answer! Blystad, Andersen, answer! Oh, fuck! Liv, can you open your eyes? Thank you. Good. The wrist fracture you got was quite severe. So the cast has to stay on for at least six weeks, unfortunately. Uh-huh. Yeah. That's good. Okay. - How is Eilert? - Hmm? You know, Liv, I've been the mayor here in Nybo for 15 years. For 15 years, I've been fighting for this place with everything I have. I love Nybo. But what's happening now is just... It's just awful. A goddamned tragedy. But we will... We will get through this. Well... Our thoughts and deepest sympathies go out to those left behind. Erm... But we stand together. We stand and we fight together, like we've always done here in Nybo. We share our sorrow and stand against adversity. And we are very, very happy that it's all over now, and that we can look ahead. I'm sure that my Elin would have wanted life in Nybo to go on. What are your thoughts about the events during the wolf hunt, Berg? Erm, I'm not sure what to say, but, erm, obviously... overwhelmed... by the situation. Er... And my thoughts of course go to the deceased and their families. It's a very difficult day for all of us, so... yeah. Can you comment on there being more wolves in the Nybo area? Well, we believe there's only one wolf. What are you doing here? You were sleepwalking. I'm super tired. It feels like I haven't slept in months. I'll always look after you. NYBO AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE Hi. Do you normally shoot wolves with silver bullets? - Huh? - I found eight lead bullets in the wolf, which should've been plenty to stop the animal. But according to my autopsy results... it was this that killed it. Okay? B-But how can you be sure that it was that one that killed it? These are the entrance wounds from the lead bullets. These eight hit the heart and lung region, which should be plenty to kill a wolf. But they barely damaged the organs. Compare that to the wound from the silver bullet. Massive hemorrhaging and the surrounding tissue is completely dissolved. It's almost like a chemical reaction. What do you see? Hm? A... It's a nail. Yeah. The claw you found in the forest came from this wolf. But... W-What do you mean? The wolf lost a claw and a nail grew out? I spoke to a colleague last night for a second opinion to check if... if such mutations in wolves have been documented before. And? He said it had to be a werewolf. But they're not real. We're looking for Lars Brodin. Er... He's right over there. He's been coming and going, but... Well... A peculiar fellow. The other day I saw him making ammunition. Is he a criminal, or what? Er... Thank you. We will be in touch if we need more help. So... I hear it was a successful hunt. We lost four people, one is in a coma. I wouldn't call that successful. We pulled out nine bullets. Eight lead bullets... And this one. Hmm. Listen, I would like you to tell William what you told me about... werewolves. The werewolf you shot is an old one. It's been wandering for a while. I've been tracking it for over two years now. I found it when it killed a boy in Finland, right by the Russian border. The wolf has an unusual shape but... that's probably due to extensive and prolonged scabies. Scabies? Here. You hear the word "werewolf" and you picture a mix of man and a wolf running around on two legs, howling at the moon. Most likely the Vikings brought the poison from Europe in the 12th century. Where and when the species has its origin is hard to say. But humans have always wanted to conquer and command the powers of animals. At first through various sacrificial rites. Experiments. Crossbreeding with other species. Like a scientific experiment gone to hell? Exactly! A young werewolf can be compared to a dog with rabies. Wild and crazy. Unpredictable. Driven by a hunger for human blood. When that hunger is satisfied... it joins with other wolves and starts roaming an incredibly vast area. Okay, but what happens when the poison starts working? The human will experience a gradual transformation. The senses are heightened. The face becomes more animal-like. Teeth, claws... Ah... That is when the animal takes over. But is there a way to... reverse the process? When the curse has been completed, the human is lost. There's no turning back. But the curse will not stop until the last beast is killed and the bloodline is severed. The bloodline is severed, right? JONAS: DO YOU WANT TO MEET? So, what do you think this place is called? Hmm... Well, let me guess. Is it... the Lookout? - Really? - Yeah, it's actually the Lookout. - Oh, my God. - It's true. So, what happened at school? Well, I... have no idea, actually. After what happened, everything just... Well, I... Or... Honestly, I'm a wreck. Sorry. - I should get this or my dad will lose it. - Yeah, go for it. Sorry. Hi, Dad. No, I'm just out driving. No, the car's parked. I was just getting some air. Er... Just out to see if there's anything exciting going on. Yeah, but listen, er... I'm gonna stay out for a while, so I'll be back later. Okay. Bye, Dad. Thale? Go away. Okay. Next of kin's been informed? Next of kin. Good. Okay. I'm on my way. Based on my preliminary examination, I can estimate that the victim was killed between 10 and 11 last night. But is it the same kind of wounds we saw on the body of Elin Gran? - Yes. - Liv? A word. The distance between the teeth is smaller. Smaller? Definitely an animal, but it's smaller. It's not the one that killed Elin. Fuck. I'm sorry. NYBO EXPRESS NYBO - OSLO DNA TEST RESULTS ...SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE HOMO SAPIEN SAMPLE AND CANIS LUPUS. Reports of a serious accident in the Nybo tunnel. Extent unknown, but most likely multiple people injured. Berg. How far from the Nybo tunnel are you? We're getting reports of multiple people injured. Reports of an animal, or a wolf, that's killing people. I'm at the tunnel now. There's smoke. Keep us posted. What happened? There are a lot of injured people. Hurry! Stop! There's a monster inside! Run! Run! Hello? This is the police. Liv! The wolf tested positive for human DNA. - It's Thale. - Huh? It's my daughter who is the werewolf, William. It's my daughter. I have to find her. Hi! Hi. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's okay. Shh, shh, shh. Oh, fuck! Jenny... You have to hide. You have to run and hide. Oh, shit! Hurry up! Goddamn, someone's crashed! Look at that! Run! We're getting several reports of a wolf downtown. - Oh, my God. - Multiple severe injuries. Multiple severe injuries. Permission is granted to carry a rifle. Over. Oh, God, I can't shoot my own daughter. If I can get in range, I have enough tranquilizer for an elephant. Sister. Sister. I will look after you. Arthur? Arthur! Arthur! Look at me! Arthur! Look. Arthur! Where... Where's Jenny? Run. Sister. Sister. Sister. I'll look after you. Jenny! Come on! Run! In there! Move! Look out! Jenny! Jenny! Hide! William... William! William... Let go! There, there, there. Shh, shh, shh. I'm sorry, sweetheart. Mom is here. Shh, shh, shh. - Hi. - Hi, are the papers done? - What's this? - Make sure you... - Have a nice evening, Liv. - Thanks, you too.
