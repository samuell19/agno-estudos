Beautiful Dreamer - We wouldn't touch with the bad guys! - Do we have to shoot anybody? - They're shooting at us! - How goofy When I'm the pilot We're not gonna shoot anybody. - What's wrong? - My ankle Come on let's go to the barn. Sorry you got hurt Joe. I love it Come on let's dance. Come on Forward, side Joey, at your folks There's been an accident. ...The Shadow of the Almighty I will sayeth the Lord is my refuge. My fortress, my God. In Him I will Trust. Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler and from the noisome pestilence. He shall cover thee with His feathers and under His wings you will find refuge. - Come on you can try. - No I don't wanna.. - Come on! - No I don't know how! Just hold on to it You've seen me do it a hundred times. Just hold it here. That's it. If we catch something we're throwing it back. - Think we got something babe. - What? - Oh my God pull, pull, pull, pull it in. - No I don't want to. Pull it in! What is that? - Will you? - Oh you know I will... - A little more love? - A lot less muscle, right? Here you need this. Come here. For Pete's sake Joe, use a little more love and a little less muscle. I have the distinguished honor of presenting the President of the United States. "Yesterday, December 7th 1941 a date which will live in infamy" "The United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked" "by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan." "I ask that the Congress declare" "that since the unprovoked and dastardly attack by Japan" "on Sunday, December 7th, 1941" "a state of war has existed between the United States and the Japanese empire." Did you hear? The whole world's gone crazy. You'll take care of my girl till I get back Here, I want you to have this. My father gave it to me 40 years ago. Got me through some tough times. I think it's time you had it to strengthen you. I remember this. Take care of yourself. - Thanks Grandpa. - Keep that. You come back to me... Ok? I don't care what you do or how you do it, you just come back. I love you. Dear Claire, I received your photo today. Funny what you think about when you're so far from home. God I miss fixing planes with you and holding you close. I'll bring your picture with me Tomorrow we're going out again. Lights out, Love you. Joe Visibility over here, we should put it at 9000 feet by 0800 (hrs). 9000 ft? Sounds gonna be like kicking a hornet's nest and having nowhere to run. Yeah we got our backs ain't that right Connor? - Yes, sir - Alright, let's do this fellas He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress my God; in Him will I trust. Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence. Let's go fellas -Elevators. - Elevators checked. - Aileron? - Checked. - Rudder? Checked. Here we go Where are they? Two o clock. What's happening. One out, six. She's burning oil. We're never gonna make it with those clouds! They got number one. - Bobby! - He's hit! I'll go get him. I'm hit!. Hang in there. We got you. It's no good Joe we're going down. Get on out of here. Make sure's Bobby's strapped in. Get out! Ok let's go, let's go everybody out. Go Go! What? He's missing in action Claire. It was announced in San Francisco half an hour ago by a high American official not identified He's saying that Germany has surrendered unconditionally to the Allies, no strings attached. Welcome home, Ray So nice to see you. Congratulations on getting engaged. Come on in! It's just such a surprise. So nice to see you Was just doing the dishes, excuse me. Oh please come in and sit down. It's nice to see you You look so well Ray. Thank you Gee it's great to see you Claire. It's about Joe. I thought you would've known long before now. I saw Joe's plane go down. I know, it went down 2 years ago. Just waiting for him. But he made it.. There were a lot of shoots Claire. And when you count em from so far away, everyone just hopes all the guys got out. One of the guys couldn't jump. Joe was trying to save him. All the survivors are POWs now so they're just trying to put the pieces together. There's a letter coming. Joe's my friend I wanted to tell you first. Claire if there's anything I can do Anything at all My goodness look at me, I have no manners i didn't even ask you for tea, would you like some Claire, come here Honey you're gonna be ok I'll be down at the hangar if you need me here. It's a nice day huh? -Yeah I was looking through the advertisements for work. I thought maybe I could help you at the hangar instead. There's not much going on down there but I'd be grateful for the company. Of course I couldn't payyou much. That won't work. Good morning. Nope. Well when it gets too hot I just go outside for a spell and sit down in the shade. Grandpa what's happened? When the war broke out everybody who could fly went overseas. I told them about a month ago to shut all this down. So how are you supposed to run a business when you can't even have a phone or electricity There's not much business left to run. Why didn't you say something? Because you had troubles of your own. No sense in both of us worrying about it. Well there's only one thing we can do. We're just going to have to find some new business. Well I've tried. There's not a thing around here. Well we'll just have to go somewhere else and bring it in here. That was Tanner Crop Dusting I talked to them a year ago. There's no business there. Well that was a year ago. He just bought five PT17s from government surplus and he wants us to do the conversion. Well well well... Well find out where he bought them. We might get some parts from old Uncle Sam.. - Ma'am I'm thinking.. - What about? Maybe you ought to find something else to do. - Why, am I doing something wrong? - No, nothing like that. Just maybe this is not the right place for you. This is where I wanna be. You're my family. Honey, Maggie and Ray are starting their own family. and the prettiest girl in Boone City is cleaning blow barrel oil off a Stearman It doesn't make any sense. I like it. Why are you doing this? Because there's more to life than fixing airplanes and having dinner every night with an old man. I hope Ray doesn't mind I spend so much but this was so precious. Hi honey! Good morning Maggie, do we have any money left for lunch or is it back to washing dishes in the back. Ray, I'm very frugal. - Don't worry kids, lunch is on me. - Oh, well what am I gonna have.. Excuse me. - Pete! - Ray! What a surprise! - How you've been? - Swell, I'm swell. Me too! What a surprise to see you What are you doing in Boone City? I'm on my way to Sacramento. Joe lives here, Joe Kelly, I was gonna try to look him up. - He's dead, you knew that. - I didn't know that. When did he die? In the crash with you, he was trying to save... No, Ray. Joe didn't die in the crash. I even saw him a year later. I'm sorry, Maggie this is Pete, Joe's co-pilot. - How do you do? - Hi! He says Joe might still be alive. - What about Claire? - Joe's Claire? Yeah Pete. You're gonna have to tell her what you just told me. Of course! This is good news right? Yeah... Claire, this is Pete. This is Doug. Nice to meet you. Have a seat. Claire, I was Joe's co-pilot. I was in the plane that went down. And there's been a mistake. Joe didn't die in the crash. We were all picked up by German patrollers and put in separate POW camps. But then I saw him a year later. He was in the back of a truck with some guards. I yelled to him. I don't know if he heard me. - Are you sure? - Yes. - You think that he might still be alive? - He was the last time I saw him. I'm sorry. Will you excuse me for a moment.. Claire! Claire, wait! I know that Joe is out there I can feel it! I have to think, I'm sorry. I buried Joe once. I can't bury him again. I just have to know what happened to him. What does it take, Claire? Do you have to find the gravestone in Europe to be sure? If Joe is alive he'd be with us right now. I have work to do. Do you think I'm foolish? I think you're wonderful. I'll be praying for you. Tom tells me you're looking for your husband who went down in a B24 somewhere in Germany, is that right? Yes sir, it is. Why would you come here? The official report says that your husband was killed and he went down with his airplane. Because at the funeral all we did was bury dog tags. Couldn't there be some sort of mistake? I know it says nobody was found but I know lots of reports like that. Joe Kelly is buried somewhere in Europe. Now I don't wanna sound hardhearted but that's happened to a lot of families. I know someone who saw him a year after he supposedly died. Could he be ina hospital or anything? If Joe Kelly had let himself be known We would have contacted you. What if he was injured so badly that he doesn't... Joe Kelly is a hero. Because of him most of his crew survived. Unfortunately it looks like he wasn't one of them. Now you can go in there and check for yourself if you like. But it's tough in there even if you do it on a daily basis. I need to. Look at this... Oh my God! John! He's my husband! I'm looking for my husband. He was a B24 pilot. And he was shot down in 1943. I don't know much, I... That's interesting. I spent quite a bit of time in German hospitals. We may have crossed paths, particularly if he was badly injured. You know when I was released from hospital they sent me to StalagLuft 1 It was the only real facility that had to handle any of us that still had medical problems. I have to tell you, I don't remember the name Joe Kelly. 'Course I can steer you in the right direction. Now don't get your hopes up too much but this Will Martin fellow, he did know everybody, everybody knew him. He's quite a card, I think you're gonna enjoy him. He's at a small airfield, just before you get to Harris. Thank you. Tommy we'll get your plane fixed, someone will call you. Until then keep your head on honey. Excuse me is this William Martin's business? - Who wants to know? - I do.. I'm Will Martin. How may I help you beautiful? Oh bud, Casanova's back? The village is safe again. Don't mind Jeannie.She flunked out of 'charm' school. - She punched the instructor. - I did. I'm sorry, I was wondering if I could have a monent of your time. I'm sure you're busy but... I'm not too busy for you. Come on in my office. Thank you very much for your time. I've just been to the VA. Baynes said you were in StalagLuft1 during the war. Yeah, I was. Did you happen to know a Captain Joe Kelly way over there? No didn't know him. If he was there, I'd have known. Tommy's got that parked. He's gonna stop off and get something to eat. He was wondering if he should pick up something for you? No. I might have plans! Ok. Bill, honey, take a seat. So should we go get something? We could continue to talk. No actually, I'm sorry, I don't have time. I have to go. Thank you for your time. You should get some food with your friend. - Did you tell handsome he can eat by himself? - Yes I did. Good Girl! Excuse me. Hey Bill! Come on in. What? Oh come on baby, come on! Oh gosh, gosh God, just help me! I was just teasing. Hi hon! Come here, take any seat, I'll be with you right away. No, I don't want to eat. I think I need a garage, I heated my car. Chester's the only one left. It's a couple of miles out on the highway. I don't think my car can drive that far. There's no other mechanics in town? Oh no, there's only 'one' garage. Now there 's plenty of fellas around here that can fix things. I mean the best mechanic in town is sitting right over there. Tommy went out to his truck. he forgot his wallet again. Oh there, hey Tommy! This young gal needs your help. This young lady's having car trouble. Do you think you can help her? Sure. What seems to be the trouble, ma'am? - I... I'm so sorry... - That's alright You ok honey? - You ok miss? - Here here here. This usually happens after you eat the meatloaf. Quiet, Everett! Tommy, why don't you go check on her car and I'll give her something to eat. - Where's your car ma'am? - It's outside, out there. Joe? Mike, steak and eggs. That'll help. Are you sure you wanna do that Ruby? She still looks a little shaky to me. I'm warning you, Everett! - I need to help him. - No, no you need to eat. He knows what he's doing. He'll take good care of your car. I gotta give him my keys. - What was that all about? - You got me. - You okay ma'am? - Sure. - How are you? - I'm fine. You sure you're okay? I've just been driving all day I'm really tired. Can I get your keys? Sure, I think they're in the car. - What wss your name again? - Tommy. Could you turn it over? Thank you God... Ok, that's fine ma'am. It got pretty hot. I fixed the hose but it could damage the engine pretty good. - Can you fix it? - I'd like to - I'm sorry, what was your name? - Claire Kelly. Claire... It's just my partner and I, we got a lot of work to do We got this huge deadline coming up. But Chester will be able to take care of you. - You from around here? - Boone City. It won't get you there, but if you keep some water in it, it gets you around town for a few days. Just take it down over to Chester. He's real good, he'll fix it up alright for you. - Can I pay you for your time? - It's no trouble at all, ma'am. Tommy? Thank you for...Thank you. It's my pleasure, Claire. I'm over at the airfield if you need anything else. I'm sure I'll see you around. Are you from here? No. Remember not to drive too far with your car like that. "I don't know what to do but don't worry about it." Okay. You wouldn't find a better mechanic within 100 miles of here. He was nice. He and Will Martin own the airfield on the way into town. - That one with the B-24 in it? - Yeah, that's the one. Carol got a job a the hospital. Hey, eat up. How's your car, hon? Well, it won't be making it to Boone City. Is there a motel or anything like that around here? My sister has a boarding house just down the street. And it's very close to the nice restaurants in town. Wanan think about it? - You just dropped off the bus? - Of course she did silly. Yeah I miss my mum. She's working today. When is she not? Hello. Anyway, we'll see you later. Bye, Sherry! Hi, mum! That's my baby girl. What are you doing here? Why didn't you call? I didn't want you to talk me out of it. - Hey everybody, Sherry's home! - Hi! Hi, Everett! That's my daughter. Excuse us. You look older. - Mum you saw me last Easter. - Why you back so soon? I don't know. I was worried about you I guess. - What about school? - I'll finish next semester. How about that boy you were seeing? The one with the funny name? Percy? He's alright. He knows this is something I have to do. I'm not a cherry case. You know I forgot to bring it last time. Mum we haven't talked about Steven since he was killed. - Is that why you came back? - Yes. And the fact that you can't keep a waitress here for more than a week. I have to get ready for the dinner barrage. Now just go freshen up and you can give me a hand later. You look beautiful. I'll have your cheque right away. - Grandpa - Claire? - I found him. - Where are you? I'm in Harris. I'm at Ms Lane's boarding house. Harris. I can get by morning if I left right now. No, no way. Something's wrong with him. He doesn't know who I am. Oh my God. I'll call Col Chambers and see what I should do. I'll call you in the morning. Alright, I'll wait to hear from you. - Ok I love you Grandpa. - I love you too. - Grandpa! - Claire! - I'm so glad you're here. - We'll see what this doctor has to say. Doctor, this is Claire and William Kelly. They were referred by Col Chambers. Thanks for seeing us. - I'm Joe's grandfather. - Oh yes, please sit. Doctor Kessler, we're here to find out what happened to my grandson. Claire told me on the phone that he doesn't remember her and he's answering to another name. Outside of this personality shift Is he showing any other outward signs of mental instability? Right well without an examination, all we have is guesses. But it is possible that blood force trauma to the head or severe shock could cause a condition called dissociative identity disorder. It could be caused by physical, chemical or psychological aberrations. So no two cases are alike. Hell it's pretty fascinating really We've seen a lot more cases ever since the war. Doctor as fascinating as it is to you, we're talking about my grandon and Claire's husband. Can we take him home? No, Sir. I don't think you can. Without letting the mind heal on its own time. He can be capable of living a normal life impaired as it may seem. It's not a normal life he's living as another person. Shock to his existing environment could be very damaging. But I think we're lucky seeing you Ms Kelly didnt damage him further. What do you mean damage him further? Look, I realise you're very excited about having found Joe. but you have to resist trying to remind him of who he was. Rather, who he is. Look Mr Kelly I want to shoot it to you straight. Having seen Claire, seeing you might just cause him to shut down. Damn it what are we supposed to do? Just sit by while he builds another life for himself? No, no. Of course not. Claire, he saw you. Did he react at all? Well you stay near. Maybe as the mind heals, he'll be able to accept the memory of her. Love is a very strong force. I've seen it keep soldiers alive on the battlefield when they shouldn't have had a chance in hell. - Alone? - Yes. It's your best bet. Thank you. Tommy, is that Beechnut 18 gonna be done by next week? Yeah if all goes as planned. It sure looks that way. Those boys up in Denver wont be able to say we're too small to handle that contract now. Beat their deadline by 10 days. I'm gonna get some real money, get out of that hand-to-mouth. Yeah well take it easy there partner. We only got one small plane. Yeah well when we get that contract we'll be rolling in planes. And we got the best mechanic and the best damn pilot west of Mississippi. - We'll make it! - When did you hire a new pilot? Jeannie? Will you please remind me why you're still here? - No one else will put up with you. - Oh right. Tommy, you gonna come down to Ruby's for lunch? Yeah I'll see you there. - What can I get for you? - A cup of coffee. Alright, I'll be right back with it. Coffee for that man over there. - Good afternoon! - Well what do we have here? Are you talking about the specials Or you wanna know what knid of soups we have. Claire, I didn't know you worked here. I have to earn enough money to get my car fixed, so. Did you take it to Chester's? I did. He said it would be around a hundred dollars or so. Wow, that's a pile of money. You should just stay here. Marry me. Tommy, can I take your order or do you want me to get you something to drink. You can take my order. How's about you and I go out for dinner this evening? I'll take whatever Ruby has on special. And a glass of lemonade. One special coming up. Excuse me. I'd like to order too? I'm sorry, Mr. Martin. What would you like to have? - Just make it two of the same. - You got it. I don't think that gal likes you. She'll come around. Bye! Claire, you can stop by the hangar anytime. Really, I'd love to. - Well, there's not much to see. - But there will be. Well, I could come by tonight after work Around 6? I'll bring dinner. Alright. I wonder what changed her mind. People have wondered that for years, my friend. Just how I do it. It's better not to question. Just observe, you know. Marvel. Well Mr. Marvelous, don't forget. You're buying today. And who might you be? I'm Peggy. - Peggy's my friend, right? - Yeah Hi. Hello, baby! - Hello, Tommy! - Hi, Rachel! Thanks for looking after Peggy. Put your bike in the hangar honey. We got to go. Claire, this is Rachel Thompson. Rachel, this is Claire Kelly. - Hello - How do you do? - Tommy, could I talk to you for a moment? - Sure. Excuse me. - I was wondering if you had any plans tonight? - What did you have in mind? Dinner. I made a pot roast. Your favourite. Ok. Come on, honey. I have to pass, Rachel was planning on me coming over and has made a big supper. She seems like a close friend. Yeah. Well I help her out with Peggy. - I'll see you later. - Good night. So how long have you known Tommy? Since the war. They brought us to camp Lucky Strike. I'd like to know about that. Well there were thousands of GIs. Nobody cared who you were. Everybody's talking about home. Except Tommy. So I figured he didn't have any place to go. - So I offered him a spot back here. - You took care of him. How you holding up? My shift is over. I think I'll go soak my feet. I don't know how you do it. Well could be, I'm stronger than you think. Mum can we talk about Steven Talking about him is not gonna bring him back, baby. Well we cant just go on pretending he never existed. Well you know that's not what we're doing. Mum I miss my big brother. There's so much I wish I'd said to him. You know what? I think he can hear you. I talk to him all the time. You haven't seen the work order from Miller's plane, have you? No I haven't seen it. You wanna look at Will's office? Jeannie, where did this come from? I got that in yesterday's mail. Isnt that the big contract you boys signed? I hope not. What do you mean? There's things in here I've never even heard of before. Well, maybe Will... Well this is my signature on this thing, I didn't sign this! Tell Will I wanna see him as soon as he gets in. Righto. Jeannie, didn't he say he was gonna be back here by 3. He said 3 o clock. - Where the heck is he then? - Who knows? We need to talk. - I can explain Tommy. - What are you trying to do to us. Look, I went over the contracts. I was gonna talk to you about it later but there may be a small mistake. Mistake? How can you possibly move this much chargo with only one airplane? You're gonna attach a toilet to it or something? Tommy, if we didn't do this thing they wouldn't take the bid! They're gonna take our company, Will. Tommy, this is a really big opportunity for us. Why did you sign my name to this thing? Tommy, when I was down there talking to the attorney he specifically said to me... This guy has the right to foreclose on our business Will, if we don't deliver What are you talking about? Didn't you read this lousy contract? They can take everything! I'll call the guy up Tommy. I'll get him to give us an extra week! It wouldn't matter if they gave us an extra month, Will. We cannot move that much cargo! Tommy, look I... You're a fool for signing this, Will! You should have never signed my name to it! - Jeannie, how much money do we have in the bank? - 100-150 dollars. I'll be back in tomorrow. Will always said I graduated from charm school. I bet I could do a good job. I know you could, I'm just not looknig to hire any help right now. Well I'm not really looking. But it never hurts to find out what's available, right? What are you all talking about? Tommy really let in to Will today. I never heard them like that before. Tommy's been real edgy lately. He thinks that Will just about put us out of business. Is that right? Tommy's been pretty hot. Seems the contract they got that has a few more paragraphs in it that Will didn't thought it did That's too bad. Those boys had worked too hard to lose everything. I just didn't know how hard it was gonna be. Most people would have just given in and tried to push him. I've known him my whole life. And now, it's just erased. i can't do it. I can't take it. Are we talking about what he needs or what you need? Claire, you all right? I just keep thinking that if I look at him. I'll see him in there. I've seen it happen. I need you to keep thinking that way. Where's your dog tags buddy? They're gonna kill you without it. Put these on you. You're alright now, ok? Thomas Warner. It's a damn good name. - Hey! - You murderers! Whatever the hell that means. I'm Will Martin. Tommy? That is a nasty head wound. They got you good. I miss fixing planes with you and holding you close. I'll bring your picture with me Tomorrow we're going out again. Love you, Joe. Hi, Jeannie! - Hi, Tommy! - Hi Claire, what brings you out here today? I was just wondering if there's anything that I could do. It seems everyone from Ruby's has to advise, thanks to Jeannie.. Sorry, Jeannie. I'm sorry. Most folks just wanna help. - Could be a lot of folks care about you. - Could be bad news travels fast. A lot of folks do care about you, Tommy. Well there's nothing that could be done now. Maybe there is. Will committed us to move a lot more cargo than we could ever possibly move. And the worst part is we might lose everything. Of course you probably already knew that, seems everybody does. It doesn't seem like much But this is all I got. Who owns that B-24 out front? Pigeons, owls, whatever. Do you think it can haul enough freight to satisfy your contract? - What? - Well you need another plane right? Claire, do you realise what it would take to get that thing in the air? It had to run to get here, didn't it? Claire, the problem is we don't have any money. If we had money we could go out and buy another airplane. If I could get you all the parts, do you think you can get it to run in time? Claire,you're working at Ruby's to get your car fixed. You got spare parts in that trunk of yours? I used to work at Kelly Airfield in Boone City. I was in charge of all the parts. I know somebody. He'll probably give us a couple of months to pay him back. What do you think? I think you're a dreamer. I'll think about it. Jeannie, may I borrow your phone? Jeannie? Can you get a hold of Will, Tell him I need help with that B-24 Righto. - Could you get a hold of Claire as well? - Ah yes. - Hi! - Hi, Claire! Hey hot stuff! So two for dinner? Actually Rachel and Peggy will be joining us. Could you get us 3 sodas and a bomber? Sure. Claire, those parts came in. I can't thank you enough. Sure, anything I can do to help. Don't know what we could ever do to repay you. Just get that plane fixed. I'll get those sodas. - Hi, Tommy! - Hi, Peggy! - Don't I get a hug? - Hi, Will! - Hi, Tommy! - Hi, Rachel! Thank you. - Have you guys ordered? - Of course not. Claire just went to get us some sodas and I ordered a bomber for Peggy. - What is a bomber anyway? - You don't know what a bomber is? Everett, what's a bomber? It's a big plane that drops bombs I thought you'd know that. A bomber is when you mix all the soda fountain flavors together. Will this is nice. Which one of you are gonna marry my mommy? Oh, I'm sorry! Claire, can you go back and help Mike with the potatoes. Gosh, Ruby, you make everybody that spill go back and peel potatoes? No, sorry no. We're just... We're a little behind back there. What will you folks have? Baby? - Macaroni and cheese. - Okay. Leave those potatoes alone. - I thought you said you wanted me... - No, I thought you needed a break. I'm really sorry out there I didn't mean to spill that drink. You know everytime Tommy Warner comes in here, you get a ilttle bit flustered. - I'm turned around. - I know that. Darlin Will told me that when you first got to Harris, you asked him about his time in the war. Now I can't help thinking that you were looking for something more than war stories from Will. Ruby, war changes things. I'm just trying to figure things out. What is it about Tommy, honey? I can't explain it. Now do you think you can get their order to them without dropping the steak in Rachel's lap? No I don't think I can. But I'll take Table 4. Thank you. Hi! Hi! I went to the post office. Where shall I put these? You can set them right over there on the crate. I think it's your fuel pump. - Thank you. - Sure. Looks beautiful. Yeah, I'd almost forgotten. I've been around a lot of airplanes. But this is my first time around a B-24. It's what I flew in the war. What was it like to fly? You made it back. That's all that matters. Yeah Hey Tommy! How's she coming along? She's getting there. I just wanted to bring that part by. You can afford to see me dance this weekend. Oh, ok. Sorry you got hurt, Joe. Buddy, you okay? Yeah I'm fine... I just got dizzy. - You sure you're all right? - Yeah I'm fine. You can't fly like that. Are you sure? Yes. I'm just saying she goes to the hangar a lot. She's just helping me fix the plane. Honestly Tommy, why would she spend her free time helping you fix that plane if she didn't want something from you? Rachel... One of these days she's gonna go back to wherever it is she came from. - And I'll be here. - So will I. - Maybe. Well, I'm gonna go get ready for the dance. It's just a plane. - Hi, Claire! - Hi, how are you? Good how are you? How's the plane going? It's doing well. I think they'll be ready on time. What's the matter Rachel, my deadbeat partner wont dance with you? You got a headache huh? Don't worry about it. Come on Rachel, I'll dance with you. Let's go sweetie. - Have fun! - See you later..
