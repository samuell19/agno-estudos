(wind blowing) We found each other. You found me. My favorite place. We were in love. Hi, you've reached Valerie's phone. I can't talk right now, but if you leave a message I'll get back to you as soon as I can. We were... (plane engines) Arriving in France for the first time felt like entering a new world. Here it was at last. Paris. So cultured... So historic... So... European. Naturally, when foreigners visit they are, of course, well aware... that English is not the first language of the people of France. It's also considered polite to learn at least the bare minimum of French in order to communicate. Indeed, all travelers are aware of these points. Where would you like to go, please? Or not. You don't speak French? I'm sorry, I don't understand otherwise. Could you speak to me in French? Umm... just into, like, the Eiffel Tower? Ah, the Eiffel Tower. Okay. Great. In truth, many French people do actually know how to speak English. It's just that... it can be quite annoying... when a foreigner just expects us to speak it for them without question. Uhh, sir, you can stop up here. I stop? Yes. Okay. Thank you. And just like that... he sees her. The most beautiful girl in all of France... who is absolutely not the narrator, for the record. Her smile... so soft, and inviting. Her eyes... Her eyes, so bright and vividly green... they almost seem unreal. She catches him off guard with her beauty... but he quickly recovers. Excuse me? Hi there. I'm trying to get to the Hotel Europe. Do you know how to get there from here? Yes? No? You can't understand a word I'm saying, do you? At least you're the first person who hasn't walked away while I make an ass of myself I guess that's something. Un moment, s'il vous plait? Pouvez-vous aide moi trouver Hotel de... de l'Europe? Merci? Typical American. You come to another country and expect everyone to speak your language. And your French is ridiculous, by the way. Okay, great, so I'm just gonna go that way then? I'm sure you'll figure it out, my imbecilic friend. I have to go now but, good luck. Awesome. Hey, thanks so much for your help. Okay, maybe she was just a little bit harsh on him when they first met. To be fair though, she was in a hurry to meet with someone else. And one can't be faulted for having a little fun at the expense of a clueless tourist. Still... there was something about him. (acoustic guitar playing) Bonjour? Bonjour. Sorry to bother you. I don't suppose you know how to speak English? Yes, I speak English. You do, okay cool. I'm trying to find the hotel that I'm staying at here in Paris. The Hotel Europe. I've got a map here if that helps. It's here. Not too far from Gare du Nord, the... North train station. Yeah, north train station, do you know? This way? Yeah, this way, yeah. Okay, cool. Thank you so much for your help. You are a lot more help than this jerk of a girl I ran into earlier. Really? And what happened with this jerk you ran into? Umm... Yeah, no, I mean she was just a real jerk, you know? You know, I actually think she knew how to speak English but didn't just to mess with me. God, you know, who does that? Did you actually ask her if she spoke English? Pretty sure I did, yeah. Oh, pretty sure, huh? Okay, well maybe I didn't ask her directly, but I started speaking English. So I'm sure it's safe to assume that's what I'm asking. It's best not to assume things when you're not in your own country. Right, don't assume things. Number one rule in France. Got it. Comment tu t'appelles, uhh, what is your name? Ethan. I'm Isabelle, and this is Valerie. Pleased to meet you both. You're American, yes? Canadian, actually. You know, it's funny because this non jerk girl... I heard her call me an American as well. Maybe she was assuming things too. Oh well, I guess nobody's perfect. Listen, I just got into town on a bit of an extended vacation in France and I'd love to have a couple of guides to show me around if you two aren't busy tomorrow. I have to work but Valerie is on vacation as well. She could show you around. What the hell are you doing? You're embarrassing me! Oh come on, I can tell you like him. You need to live a little - what's the harm? Look, I understand if you can't, it's okay. No. She would love to show you around Paris, Ethan. She would? She would. I... would. Of course, I would love to show you around Paris, Ethan. As Isabelle said, I'm on vacation as well. It would be my pleasure. That's great. Awesome. We can meet tomorrow morning Jardin de Tuileries. 9 AM. Okay. I'm sure you can find it, yes? Yeah, that sounds great. Well, ladies, it was a pleasure to meet both of you. Isabelle. And... Valerie. Ethan. I don't need you playing Cupid for me, you know? You were flirting so much you might as well have asked him to spend the night at your place. Quit it! Ethan! Ethan. Don't forget this. Right. The map. Okay, so I'll see you tomorrow then. Tomorrow, yes. Like I said... Quit it, I said. Do you have a reservation? Yes. For tonight? - Yes, under what name? Ethan. Okay, that's room 32... Third floor. The elevator is right over there. Thirty two. Third floor. All right. Have a nice stay. Maybe it was blind luck... or perhaps it was the stars aligning exactly as the universe had intended, for these two to cross paths a second time. And then, of course, there's also the factor of a certain best friend... who was perhaps a little too eager to play matchmaker on top of everything. But that's another story. Either way... they now had the perfect opportunity to build on this obvious, unspoken attraction. Yeah, that's better... Thank God for internet searches, right? Valerie. Hey, Ethan, you made it. Well, I wasn't sure if you'd get lost again. Almost, but... I think I'm starting to figure this city out a bit. Wow, you look amazing. Oh, merci. Well, you know, Paris is the fashion capital of the world, so... I thought it was, umm, New York? Oh no, no. It's Paris. Okay. Yeah. So, umm... shall we start your tour? After you. So, there's this thing there... So have you always lived in Paris? Oh no, no. I'm originally from Nancy. It's a city in eastern France, near Allemagne... uhh, Germany, sorry. I came here for university, actually. Studying what? Journalism, marketing. I'm interested in fashion journalism. I'd like to work in that industry. Hence the nice outfit. And here I was thinking you got all dressed up just for me. And what about you, Ethan? Where are you from in Canada? Vancouver. Oh, umm, with the Olympics and the mountains? Yeah, that's the one. Oh, nice. And what do you study there? I've taken some photography courses. It's kind of a hobby of mine. So, this camera around your neck is more than just for a tourist. You want to be a professional photographer, huh? Yeah, something like that. Cool. You know that photographers are very important in the fashion industry. I mean, you could be a famous photographer here in Paris. Who knows? Maybe I'll let you take photos for my magazine. You have your own magazine? No, but I will. Just give me a few years. So... are you gonna be in any of the photos of this magazine of yours? I haven't decided yet. What do you think? Should I model for my own magazine? You could. If you wanted to scare off all the readers. Hey! (♪♪♪) (inaudible) (camera shutter) So, how long do you plan on staying in France? My ticket says for three weeks... But it's open ended if I had a reason to stay longer. And what would be a reason to stay longer? Seeing things like this. There's more to France than the Eiffel Tower, you know. I'm beginning to see that. But as long as you're here, you might as well get the most out of it. Come on, let's go! I think the entrance is over there. That's for the lift, we take the stairs. The stairs? Oui, let's go! Come on, Ethan, keep up! Did you know there are 1,665 steps to the top of the Eiffel Tower? No, and I'm not sure I needed to know that given the circumstance. Let me see the photo you took. Oh, you can't. You mean you won't let me? Give me that. Suit yourself. Okay... What kind of camera is this? Where's the screen to see the pictures? It's a film camera. You can't see the photos after you take them, they have to be developed first. Yeah, well, what's the point? If you can't see what you're doing, how will you know if it's any good? If you're a good photographer you just know. You trust yourself. Some things are worth the wait. Okay, fair enough. Well be sure to show me your pictures when you get them developed then. I will. Uh huh... Okay, let's have some more pictures with your ancient camera Mr. Luddite. Did you just call me a Luddite? I'm not a Luddite, I just... You'll understand when you see the pictures shot on film. Sure. So... What do you think of Paris, Ethan? I think it's beautiful. It's the most amazing city I've ever been in anywhere. You know, maybe you French aren't all the bunch of snooty... wine and cheese eating snobs... that you're made out to be in the movies. Wine and cheese eating snobs, huh? Yeah. You know, with a beret and a baguette. Oui, oui. Maybe you're not a plaid sweater-wearing lumberjack... who lives in an igloo and says 'eh' at the end of every sentence. Fair enough. Ethan. It is safe to say that... we like each other. Yes? Yeah. I'd say so. But we don't really know much about each other yet. Do you already have a boyfriend? No. Do you? Like, do I have a boyfriend? You know what I mean. I wouldn't have come to France alone if I did. You don't have one then. I don't. Are you some... macho American tourist... Who's come to France to sleep with a French girl and then leave? Macho Canadian tourist. I'm serious, Ethan, I need to know. Look, Valerie, I'm not some player who's on a conquest here. To tell you truth, I didn't think expect to meet a single person while I was here. But meeting you twice... in the same day... in a city that's this big... that's got to mean something. Yeah, that you're stalking me? That's not what I meant. I know. I know. I'd like to find out what it means. So can I see you tomorrow then? Why not? Just don't blow it like a typical American. Canadian. Shut up. (banging on door) Hello? Who is it? Qu'est que c'est? Open the door! Open the door now, it's the police! Open up now, you're under arrest! Open the door immediately or we'll break it down! Open the door now, Ethan, it's the police! Jesus Christ, Valerie, you scared the hell out of me. Bonjour. How did you know which room I was in? I asked the front desk. I'm friends with the clerk. Friends with the... Yeah, come on, get dressed or we'll miss our train. I've already booked our tickets and we go in one hour. What? Yeah. You came here to see more of France, right? Well, I've got the perfect place to start. Pack your bags, come on! Pack my bags? Valerie, I've booked this hotel for a week. I don't think I can just leave. Yes you can. As I said, I'm friends with the clerk. You won't be charged for the nights you don't stay here. Oh! Right, I'm gonna go get dressed then. Yeah, good idea. Yeah. I'll be downstairs. Hurry up, slow poke. [conversation in French] Are you ready? Yeah. Okay. Thanks for the wake up call. Let's go then. Have a nice day in Paris. Thanks. Hurry up, the train is almost leaving! So... are you gonna tell me where we're going or what? It's a surprise. Come on. So, are you gonna tell me where we're going? You came here to see France, right? I'm going to show you France as I see it. As I want you to. What is that up there? C'est le Mont St. Michel! It's a French abbey built in the 12th century. This is my favorite place in all of France. My family would take us here nearly every year when I was young. I would run around laughing with the ocean breeze in my face. I would dance around, even never opening my eyes. It was like... walking in the clouds. Come on. Dance with me, Ethan. Let me show you what it feels like. I'm not really much of a dancer. Nonsense, I'll show you, it's easy. So... One, two left... One, two right... And you make me turn... turn... Good. Again. One, two... one, two... Okay, now... Hold my back and don't let me fall. Or what? I don't wanna know? Like I said... walking in the clouds. Encore. What? Kiss me again, you silly Canadian. (cathedral bells ringing) So, what do you think of the mont, Ethan? It's great. I can see why you like it so much. I haven't been here in years, myself. I wanted to come here with you. To show you something new that you haven't necessarily seen before. So... What now? Well... There are two things I'd like to do with you. One of them you may not enjoy. Oh... Yeah. Okay, tell me the good one first. I'd like to go to Nancy and see some of my friends there with you. Sounds enjoyable enough. And the second thing? Well... Going to Nancy would mean you'll have to meet my parents as well. Oh... That's okay, Ethan, you don't have to come. I understand. I know that guys don't like to do that kind of thing. No, it's okay. I'll go with you for both, Valerie. You don't have to do that for me, Ethan, that's okay. No, it's fine. I don't mind meeting your parents. Really? Yeah. I mean, plus I'll get to see some of eastern France with you. Sounds fun, actually. Great. Here... Let me take a picture of you. Of me? Yes, of you! Okay, stand up. You're my model now and I'm not paying you to sit around like a lazy boy. Well, first of all, you're not paying me at all. Okay, tell me how this works. The exposure should be good, so just advance the film with the lever on the right. Like this? Yeah, that's right. Like this... Okay. Okay, now pose for me, Ethan. Just like how? Umm... turn into the sun a bit. And umm... look off into the distance out there. Yeah, umm... and lift your shirt up and show off your abs! What? Just do it, silly, it's a cover shot here! For your magazine? Oui. Now do as I say! Like this? No... no. It has to look candid, like... like you're not on camera. So, umm... Don't look at me... and umm... Act like you're half way through taking off your shirt in a sexy way. In a sexy way, huh? Now umm... have your expression be stern, but not too stern. Look out towards the horizon, as if you had a lot on your mind. No. No, not like that. It looks like you want to kick someone's ass. I think I'm about to! Hold that. Hold that. Okay... Now take a deep breath, and remember the sexy look... And... Gotcha! It's in the bag. How was I? Not bad for a first time model. As the editor of my magazine though, I have to make sure the pictures are up to my standards. Your standards? Yeah. My very high standards. I think it's your turn to be the model now. Oh, do you? Yeah. All right, over here. Okay, now... I want you to give me that umm... that sexy look that you wanted so badly from me. I'll show you how it's done, just keep up! I don't know what the hell I'm doing... (phone ringing) Hello mom? Yes, it's Valerie. Yeah, no - I'm in Rennes right now. I thought I'd come by to see you both, and I'm bringing someone with me. No, no, it's a friend. His name is Ethan. Oh no, you don't have to organize anything special, it's fine. No mom, don't invite any family members. I'm serious, not my cousins either, it's fine! Okay, right, I'll see you tomorrow, yeah... Is everything okay? Yeah... It's just my mom, she can be excessive sometimes, it's so annoying. Kind of like a jerk, you mean. Yeah. Sometimes. Ahh, so that's where you get it from. So you think you're funny, huh? I do have my moments, yeah. Can you hand me my bag, please? Sure. You're gonna get it! (banging on wall) Keep it down in there! Say 'Va te faire foutre'. What? Just yell at him, vaz y, 'Va te faire foutre'. Okay... Va te faire foutre! What did I just say? You just told him to fuck off. So... This is where you grew up, huh? Yeah. Isn't it peaceful? Relaxing compared to Paris? It's very relaxing here, I can tell already. The stone feels relaxing even. It radiates 'relaxing' upwards from the bottom. Nice. But I'll show you around later, right? I'd like to go to my parents' house first. Drop off our bags, greet them etc. See? Yeah, no, of course, we should do that. Oh yeah, you know my mom can be a little excessive... like I said, I mean. Yeah, you said that. In what way is she excessive? In every way. Ah. (running feet inside) Hi mom. Hello, my dear, How are you? I'm so happy to see you. Me too. Sébastien, Valerie is here. Mom, this is Ethan. Hello Ethan. He doesn't speak French, so please don't ask him anything expecting an answer, okay? I'm Valerie's mother, Brigitte. It's nice to meet you. Brigitte, it is nice to meet you as well. You are... You are with Valerie? The two of you are dating, right? How do I ask him about that? You don't, mom. It's fine. In fact, don't say anything. Okay? My English is not very good. But... you are welcome. And... you have dinner later? Oh, that's great. Thank you so much. Hello, my dear. Hi dad. How are you? Good, thanks. Dad, this is Ethan. Ethan, my dad. Bonjour. You don't have to kiss him on the cheeks, Ethan. Right, no... I mean, of course not. I just thought, 'cause of... Sorry. I'm sorry about that. No problem. Bonjour, Ethan. Bonj... bonjour. We just want to drop off our bags and go for a walk. But we'll be back for dinner, all right? Yes, of course. We're going to have a barbecue but it will take a few hours. Okay. Come inside, Ethan, we'll leave our bags. Okay. I'll take your bags upstairs if you like, Valerie. Okay, thanks. Thanks. Can I talk to you outside for a second? Sure. Come to the patio. Okay. Okay, come. What the hell was that kissing thing in there? Oh. Okay, umm... When men greet a girl here, we do the kiss. And, when another girl greets another girl, we do the kiss. But when it's two men, you usually just shake hands. I thought you knew. How the hell am I supposed to know that? I mean, I get here and everyone's hugging and kissing like it's some kind of secret French ritual... Do you think it got weird between your dad and I back there? No, it's okay. I mean... it was funny, right? But... It just shows that you're new to France. I'm sure my dad is fine, it wasn't weird at all, okay? Right. Yeah, no, 'cause it was an honest mistake. And he knows that I'm not, you know... Not that there's anything wrong with that, but he knows that I'm... I'm not. Right? Okay. You wait here. I'll go find out what's going on for dinner, then we can go for a walk. Okay. Hey... Yeah, that was weird. (arguing in French) Let's just go. Is everything okay? Go, and I'll tell you! So... Are you gonna tell me what happened back there? It's just my mom, she pisses me off. What did she do? Remember when I talked to her on the phone before we came here, and I told her not to invite anyone for dinner? I just remember a bunch of French being spoken on the phone. Well, I told her we were coming, and she said she wouldn't invite anyone else for dinner, but she did anyway, because she never listens to me! Is it that big of a deal though to have a few extra people there? I mean... it's a beautiful day out. That's not the point. She lied to me. Okay? I can't trust her, if I had something important to say if she's going to lie to me like that. Do you have something important to tell her? No, but that's not the point, Ethan! Okay, sure, I was just asking. I'm sorry, okay? It's just that she lied to me, and umm... That's something I can't stand. It doesn't matter if it's my friends or my family or you, it's just... It hurts me. Okay? So just... never do that. Do you think I want to do anything to hurt you? I don't know. Would you? I mean, I don't know... I do remember a certain someone showing up at my hotel room door knocking on it, pretending to be the police. And a certain someone like that may deserve a little bit of punishment. Oh, yeah? I think it's the same with a person who calls someone a jerk behind their back to their best friend. I think that deserves some punishment. Yeah... well that's apples and oranges. Apples and orange juice? Yes. That is apples and oranges. It is not the same thing at all. Okay. Okay, gotcha. I don't care. Because to me it's 'chou vert et vert chou'. You always cheer me up. How do you do that? I don't know, I guess it's just one of my special talents. Yeah, that works too. I know. But... Try not to go around kissing all the men tonight, please. That's a low blow. A low blow? Never mind. Okie dokie, artichoke-ee. So... how many people did you parents invite exactly? She told me no more than three or four. Okay. (crowd voices) You gotta be kidding me... Wow. Let's go. Valerie. I'm good, yeah. This is Ethan. Bonjour, bonjour. (indistinct conversation) I'm gonna go... get a drink. Are you having fun? Yeah. Your family's great. But you can't speak with them because you don't understand French. No. But I think we like each other anyway. They're all really nice to me. Come walk with me. You mean like right now? Yeah, no, sure. Can I ask you something? Sure. What do you think about being in France? I think it's great. It's incredible. I've never seen anything like France before. Yeah. But I mean, what do you think about being here with me? You're pretty much the whole reason I'm here. But you're afraid of me. I don't think so. But you are. You wonder how I feel about you. I know what you feel about me. You don't dare to say to much. You... You hold back. You keep it quiet. You worry about what I would think or what I would say... how I would react. Well, you know what? Don't worry anymore. You're nearly the perfect guy. Nearly. Yeah. There's only one thing missing. And what's that? You don't speak French yet. And why is that so important? You speak English very well. Yeah, but, if you could speak French... You'd understand me when I say... I want you to make love to me right here, under the moonlight. What do you think? Yes. Yeah, but what did I say? I don't know. But anything you say... in French sounds nice to me. Good enough? (♪♪♪) Ethan... Do you like to look at the stars? Well, I mean, I can't really... at least, not like you can out here anyway. When you live in a city like Vancouver, it's always pretty bright. So you never really see the stars in the sky. It's the same with Paris. That's why I like to come back here. You know, I used to sneak out here alone at night when I was a child. I had... a little telescope I received for my birthday. And I'd look up at the stars... and realize just how tiny we really are. You know, when we get older one day it's gonna be moments like this that we look back on and say... That was the best moment of my life. No, I'm serious. Very deep, Ethan. Thank you. I've never had a deep, existential conversation with any of my boyfriends before. Boyfriend, huh? Yeah. You sleep with me, you become my boyfriend. Do you have a problem with that? Well, if I have no choice in the matter. Okay. No more sex if you feel that way. Boyfriend. Definitely boyfriend. I thought so. You know, we should probably get back to your parents' place before they come looking for us. We probably should, yeah. Then again, we aren't in a rush... Wake up, sleepy head. Wake up. What's going on? Breakfast. Come on. You two were out late last night. We went for a walk through the village, dad. With my picnic blanket? We did some stargazing too. You know I like to do that when I stay here. Don't interrogate her, Sébastien. She likes this boy. Do you know how long he is staying in France? Ask him yourself. He's not deaf. How long do you stay in France, Ethan? Well, I was planning on staying for three weeks, but... That was before I met Valerie, so... What did he say, dear? He doesn't know, mom. I don't plan on leaving in the immediate future though. I actually really like it here in France. Ahh, okay. What did he say? So... I assume this means I should wash my picnic blanket? (door slams) Great coffee. I'm sorry if my parents annoy you. I don't think it's me that they annoy. That's right. I do wonder, though, how long this will last. The two of us like this before you have to leave. What if I stayed? That's not funny. I'm not joking, Valerie. What if I stayed here with you? You mean, like... move to Paris with me? Yes, I mean, if it's possible. Help you get that magazine of yours up and running? Is it for real? Like, something you can do right now? Yes. I mean, let me make a few calls first but yes. So you will stay here with me? Yes. Yes? Yes! Okay, okay. Here's the phone. Okay, so I'm gonna make some calls and then we'll go meet your friends. Okay, cool. I'll be upstairs. Don't be too long. I won't be. Hurry up, hurry up. (phone ringing) Hello? Mom, it's me. Oh, hi sweetheart. What time is it there? Oh, shoot, sorry I forgot about the time difference. Umm listen, anyway I'm just gonna be a second. I'm staying here in Paris. Okay... what do you mean? Well, I met somebody and she's... she's great, you're gonna love her but... I'm gonna move in with her. Sweetheart... Shouldn't you deal with this other girl... Amanda? She... actually called here a few days ago. Amanda? Mom, what are you talking about? Yeah... she called here yesterday asking for you. Did you tell her where I was? I didn't tell her anything, son. She asked where you were, and I said I didn't know... She hung up after that. Okay, listen I gotta go. Umm... I'll call you again soon. I love you. Bye... Hello? Amanda? So you do still exist. What? Did you think if you called me this late I wouldn't answer and you could hang up on me with a clear conscience? What are you doing calling my mom? What do you want? Don't you talk to me like I'm your little bitch. I called her because you won't pick up your phone, all right? I don't want to talk to you, Amanda. I've told you that, we're over. You're the one who just called me, genius, so take your own goddamn advice. I will. This is my last call just to make sure it is completely clear that it is over between us. What? Did you think you could run off to Europe for a couple of months and forget that I even exist? Is that who you are now? What are you talking about? Don't play games with me, Ethan! I did a search. On the travel site that I know you use, with you name and e-mail address. You're in France right now, so don't lie about it! What, are you stalking me now? Fuck you, you're the one who thought you could get away with banging me a few times by telling me what I wanted to hear and then tossing me aside like some whore. Is that what you're up to in France? Huh? I'll bet it is. I'll bet you've already found some cute little French slut that you can screw around with because that's just like you, Ethan, you're just a little bitch! I'm hanging up now. Oh don't worry, I know that's what you're going to do. You're gonna run from our relationship just like you always do when things don't go your way. You know, I just feel so sorry for whatever slut you find over there that doesn't know what you're like, Ethan. Have fun with your French sluts while you're over there. Just don't forget to tell them about the girlfriend that you're cheating on back here. You're not my girlfriend, Amanda. Whatever we had or you thought that we had, it's over. So just stop calling me and stop calling my mom, we are done. Well fine then! It's not like I even care anyways! I'll just go online and tell everyone how much of an asshole you... Hey. Jesus Christ, Valerie, what the hell? Valerie, where are you going? Hey, what's wrong? Where are you going? I'm going back to Paris, Ethan. Why? What's going on? Get out of my way! Where are you going? Wait, wait, wait! What happened? I heard you talking to your girlfriend on the phone. You lied to me, Ethan, that's the one thing I told you never to do to me! Valerie, you don't understand, you've got the wrong idea here! I heard what she said. How you just used her. And now you've come to France just to find a French girl to sleep with and then get rid of! Well, you know what, I won't be your slut okay? Get out of the car so we can talk! Valerie, wait! Valerie, hey, no! Don't do this! (♪♪♪) Can you hold this for me? Yeah, sure. (church bells tolling) Dejected... Sad... Hopeless... I believe this is where our story began... Is this how it would end? Or was there more to be said? (phone ringing) Hi, you've reached Valerie's phone. I can't come to the phone, so please leave a message and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Thanks. Valerie, it's Ethan. Look, I know you probably think I'm the biggest jerk you've ever met right about now. And maybe you're right. This girl on the phone, I know I should've told you about her. We weren't dating anymore, just... It doesn't even matter. I shouldn't have lied to you. And I'm sorry that I hurt you so much. I just wish I could see you again. Even if it was just to say goodbye. I'm leaving France in two days. But if you do want to talk... I'm gonna go to the bridge where we first met and I'm going to wait as long as I can until then in hopes that I might get to see you again. And tell you that, umm... that I'm sorry. I really hope you get this. Goodbye, Valerie... (wind blowing) Back to the beginning. Where they first met. Where it all began... And where it all would end. Or so it would seem... I heard you met quite the jerk on this bridge a few weeks ago. Yeah. She sure was. Or maybe... You were wrong about her, when you first met. Maybe. And maybe... it's possible she was wrong about you too... by mistake. Would you forgive her? I would. And should she forgive you? I hope so. Going somewhere? I'm supposed to fly home tomorrow. Unless... Unless what? Unless a certain jerk girl is willing to... forgive me for not being completely honest. So there's not someone else then, in Canada? No. There's no one. For certain? Valerie, she was an ex who wouldn't let go. That's it. I'm sorry, Ethan. I didn't know. It's my fault. I should've just told you I had a crazy ex-girlfriend. I can see how you might drive someone crazy. And I think this is why I need you so much. I love you, Valerie. And you'll stay here with me? I will. I love you too, Ethan. Come on, you silly Canadian. You know, that psycho girlfriend of yours has been calling my parents' house every hour for the past day and a half. Yeah, that sounds about right. So either you're the greatest man on Earth that no one can stand to lose... or you naturally drive all your girlfriends crazy. Which is it? I'd have to say the former. I'd say a bit of both. Still have to learn French, I think, if you want to live with me. As you wish. Not bad. Just need to work on your accent. It sounds funny... We found each other once more. After a little misunderstanding that was entirely not my fault... or anyone's fault for that matter, really. And so... Like two young fools... At once both stumbling and succeeding... On the never ending path of true love... We are...
