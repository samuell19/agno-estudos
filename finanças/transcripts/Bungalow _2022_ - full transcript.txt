Aw fuck. Fuck's sake! -You okay? -Yeah. Come to mommy! Look, my Sugar love. Look at this! This is home now! It seemed less nasty when we came to see it. It's the light. There was furniture hiding the dirt. We got a fucking good deal, babe. When it's done, we'll feel right at home. For sure. It's gonna be our house! We'll build it from scratch. Our palace, my love! -Oh yeah? -Yeah. No? Fuck yeah! You mean right now? -We gotta inaugurate the house! -Oh yeah. Holy shit. Hold on. Yuck! Sweet Jesus, you're beautiful! You're too low, I can't put it in. -Then bend down. -I'm bending! Hold on a sec. -No, not yet... -Sorry. -Keep going! -But... Fuck! Sorry babe! You okay? Yeah. Aw shit, my nails. ...because gold highlights are really stylish. The island is a bold choice. It creates space. We chose high-quality melamine for Manon's dream kitchen. I hope Manon is excited! Go on in! Come on! Crying like that on TV? Looks like an idiot. What do you think of your new kitchen? Look at the lamp! It's a great industrial look. With this here, it feels like we're outside. It's to remind you of your trip. The island should be on the other side. Now she has to walk around it to get to the sink. It's pretty dumb. Ugh. Your thighs are all sweaty. It's from the computer. Put something under it. The internet waves are going through your balls. It's like you read my mind. Green is a stimulating colour, it promotes wellbeing... That's a nice bathroom. No, it's too red. I'm getting mad just looking at it, imagine living in it. A little red is good. It's a colour of strength. Too much red means danger. You're right. ...for another transformation on Déco à Go? Go! The location is perfect. The yard, the parking, it's perfect. There's lot of work to do, but not that much in the long term. -You gotta think long term. -True. I'm excited to start the renos. A bit of hard work and then we're living the fucking dream! I just hope everything goes well. You know my friend Val? Valerie? -My friend from hot yoga. -I dunno. They had to replace their lead pipes because they're super poisonous. They could make your kids retarded. You don't want that. So they got a friend to do it, a discount contractor. With zero experience. But in the demolition stage, he hit the natural gas line connected to the house. The guy didn't notice because he has no sense of smell. He can't smell, can't taste either. I mean, he couldn't taste. The gas was leaking out all morning. After lunch, they must've lit up a smoke or something. And it just exploded. Half of the house just disappeared. All they found of the guy were his steel toes. Not the boots, just the toes. They had no place to go. Their insurance covered a hotel but it was 45 minutes away, which was tricky because normally the guy took the car and gave her a lift to work but that turned into a huge commute. So he gave her the car and took a bike but then there was a beer truck that didn't see the bike. He was dragged a kilometre before the driver realized. The guy spent three months in a coma. They had to unplug him because he had no brain activity and even if he woke up, he'd be a vegetable. You can't live like that! They had so much debt with the mortgage that even his life insurance wasn't enough so my friend Val ended up with all that debt. After he died, she fell into a depression. She was taking so many pills, she got addicted. She started doing coke and sleeping with strangers for the hell of it, no condom. I heard she'd go into a bar, see a guy and go and grab his dick. Last I heard, she's a prostitute in Kingston. That's in Ontario. So watch out with the little renos. There's more here. What the fuck? Jesus Fucking Christ. Holy fucking shit. What are you doing? It's all mouldy, we have to take it all down. No choice. And if we're opening the walls, might as well change the pipes. These are lead. Bad for your health. Won't take much longer. A few evenings and weekends, that's it. We hadn't planned to change the pipes. I can put a shower here and a bigger bath there. No, the bath is going there, not there. And your counter? The vanity will go there. Other way! You sure? I'm the one who drew it up! But it's not a technical drawing. Have you ever done a bathroom before? Babe, Steve did the new bathrooms at Dragnarock and they're great. So if Steve can put in some pisspots behind a curtain, why not get him to do all of our plumbing? Come on, I'm not stupid. I know about plumbing, my uncle is a plumber. Then please explain, kind sir, how you installed glass showers in your medieval bathroom? -Well... -Oh shut up. -Should we take it down? -Hell yeah. Charge! Take that! For the King! It's our only bathroom, we can't get it wrong. But we didn't plan to redo all the pipes. If we're going to open the walls, babe, might as well do it. And you're the one who said we should ask our friends. I know, but Steve? This one would fit. It costs more than my car. It's so fucking easy when you have money. That's just it. Steve costs nothing. Gotta save money where we can. A house with no bathroom is no fun. It'll be fine, my love. In two weeks, you'll have a bath in your dream bathroom. All the plaster and the painting has to be done. Who's the idiot that installed a fan with no duct to the outside? The steam will get into the ceiling. There'll be mould up there. There's a hole in your bath. Look, it goes right into the hole. That'll rot your subfloor. Just out of curiosity, what else would you do in the house? You gotta ask yourself if you want your house to be functional, or if you want to make your friends jealous. I would put up a backsplash, get new counters, new cupboards, put in a dishwasher. I'd take up the vinyl flooring. Some joker wanted to put up a loft? This is a load-bearing wall. Take it down and your ceiling will sink. If it was me, I'd change all the windows. And the floors, because linoleum is ugly as hell. Since you're opening the walls to redo the electrical, I'd put in new insulation, too. We didn't plan to open all the walls. You'll have crazy drafts in winter. If you're opening them up, you should do it. Of course. If we're opening them. If you do the plaster yourself, that'll save you money. Yeah, that's a good idea. You would do the plaster? You're not handy? You must be an intellectual, then. Since you're changing the breaker box, you might as well redo all the wiring. It's messed up, and I don't want to be responsible for a house fire. Yeah? Didn't the inspector tell you that? We didn't have an inspection. Offers with no inspection clause were preferred. If you want to finish the basement, the foundation seems solid. You'd have to insulate, pour a new floor and change the heating system. These old furnaces aren't very eco-friendly. It can get costly. Okay, like how costly? Let's see. Just to get this house into shape... I'd say around $80,000. But that's just the bare bones. No gas fireplace, no downstairs bathroom. But those are just suggestions? I mean, we can live in it like this? It's up to you to choose what kind of house you want to live in. JUNE You have one new message. Hi Sweetie. It's been a while since I heard from you. I was wondering how the house is going, how Sugar is doing. If you're wondering how I'm doing, call me back. It's so nice to see a woman do this work. I'm always looking to help a warrior in distress. A warrior? I saw all your swords and armour all over the house. Oh yeah. That's all Jonathan's. You don't wear them? My style is more the pretty damsel dresses. I'm sure you're beautiful in those dresses. You have a timeless beauty. Timeless? You could be a painting hanging on the wall of a museum. I'd hang you from my wall any day. Thanks. I'd like to see you in a dress like that someday. You can do a fashion show for me. I have to bring these to the truck. Yeah, I'm in your way though. This is your house. You're never in the way. All right then. But I'll have to charge you for an extra day. There's these ones... Look. These ones. Or those ones. 120 bucks for that, not bad. It's 120 bucks for one. We need five or six up top, plus all the cupboards down below. Shouldn't we wait a bit before doing the kitchen? No, the kitchen is important. That and the bathroom, it's the bare minimum. And Josée is free now. Yeah, but your Josée is pricey. This house is the responsibility of us both, Jo. So she's our Josée. $2432. They'll deliver them this week. Great. So he called me back the next day to say that the condom broke. Hold the absorbent tip in your urine stream for five seconds. He had a big dick though, gotta give him that. Fuckin' idiot. At least he didn't give me herpes. Even though I'm on the pill, the doctor said to take the morning-after pill. 'Cause the pill isn't a sure thing. You're doing it wrong! It's full of bubbles. You have to wet down the wall so it goes on smooth. Like this. Well, like I said, I've never done this before. I don't care for English words. Here, make it smooth. I really like how the green turned out. -Makes it feel zen. -You bet. And green is a lucky colour. Now I just have to get towels and bath bombs. And I want to put a soap pyramid in that corner. And a basket over there. That'll look nice. So should we still go get some sushi? Because I'm okay with chicken, too. Sushi for sure! Why the hell not? Well, if you're pregnant, you can't eat raw fish. Everyone knows that. Should take it easy on the wine, too. Fuck! You put it together backwards. The front is here. This is the back. You have to screw this on here, not here. -I'll start over. -No, it's fine. I'll do it. I'm already doing everything else. Oh come on! What's with you? Got PMS? Excuse me? No, I don't have fucking PMS. What's with me? I just feel like I'm on a streak of the worst mistakes of my life. They're just cupboards, babe. No big deal. I'll fix them. This isn't about the cupboards, it's about the house. And us. Maybe it was all a mistake. Okay. You still play with foam swords and your stupid fucking cards. It's like you can't grow up, like you'll never be a man. We're not kids anymore, Jo. Jesus, you can't even put on a cupboard door, for fuck sake! And suddenly IKEA is the barometer? Gotta assemble furniture to be a man? It would help, because I'm doing it all alone! You're not doing it alone! What am I doing here, playing fucking PlayStation? Since we decided to buy... Sorry, since YOU decided to buy this house, it's like everything I do is shit. Don't yell at me. Sorry babe. I don't want to yell at you, it's just... Fuck, I'm doing my best here. This isn't my forte. What is your forte? We have seven months to finish everything or I'll go into labour in a construction zone. But you're on the pill. During the move, I forgot to take it a lot. We haven't even fucked since we've been here! -That time against the counter. -It lasted two seconds! How the fuck do you forget to take the pill? I'd like to see you take the fucking pill! This is bad news to you, never mind. It's not that! It's just... a surprise. Let's just say this wasn't the plan. No. No, this wasn't the plan. Fuck! Babe? It's super good news. JULY Obviously you don't care how I'm doing. But let me just say that your father and I are doing well. You forgot Father's Day. Send us some pictures of the renos or something. And how's Sugar doing? Pretty corset. Thanks. Like I said, I'd have no problem looking at you for centuries. -Ah shit. -Sorry. Here, let me... Can I? Just to clean it off. Free doughnuts at work! Okay, I'll go get changed. It's okay. As you wish. Don't worry, plaster doesn't stain. I hope you're aware of the effect you have on people. Play with me like that and you might break my heart. All right everyone, listen up. As you know, the company changed ownership last winter. The new management ordered a productivity audit. So they analyzed our working methods with computers. It seems as though our resource management is not ideal. The external auditors recommended for the company to reduce staff numbers by 36 percent in all 12 warehouses throughout the province. The company has to follow these recommendations to meet the demands of its shareholders. So there's no way around it. The management has to let go of the packers and lift drivers. What the fuck? We're working full speed and we still can't meet the quotas! What are you going to do without us? The burden of productivity will be shared between the employees and equipment, which will be improved to be more autonomous. Robots? -You're replacing us with robots? -Fuck. Not robots, machines. And who's driving the machines? They're autonomous machines, so they drive themselves. And our Christmas bonuses? We were able to add them to your severance packages. You'll get two weeks of pay plus ten percent of your annual salary. Take some time to absorb this news... Keep. Your turn. I'll give my sorcerer a cloak and I'm attacking your knight. I block you with my volcano. Everything's been shit since we bought that damn house. If I tell her, she'll freak out. She's always freaking out. I don't even want to go home in the evening. -I cast lightning. -You can't, I have the talisman. Okay, fine. Your turn. I summon a demon. I haven't slept since we signed the mortgage. Keep. I equip my knight with the spirit blade. Attack on your troll. I have trouble breathing at night, like I have water in my lungs. Pow, you're dead. Half the time, I'm dizzy. My neck is crazy stiff and half my head is numb. And since Sarah's been pregnant... -You didn't tell me that! -Yeah. I've had a sore belly that hurts all the way down to my balls. We'll have another pitcher, please. I merge my guardians and attack your troll. Pow, you're dead. It's like I always have to piss, even when I just went. Attack on your colossus. Pow, you're dead. Maybe it's cancer or something. Maybe it's because of the laptop. I cast fireball, plus three for magic. Roll a die. That's it, you're dead. -Again? -No, I'm no good tonight. I can't go back to minimum wage. We can't even manage on the salary that I have. That you had. The problem with you guys is you always want more stuff. So you load up your credit cards and you take on mortgages. Then you re-mortgage to get even more stuff. But all that money doesn't really exist. And then you pay interest on this fake money, like idiots. Of course you're fucked in the head. And then you wonder why you have cancer in your balls. But if you want to make a quick buck, I want to put together a deck and I need rubies and diamonds. These aren't for sale. -Congrats about the baby, man. -Yeah. You're gonna be a dad. Yeah. What are you thinking about? About you, fair lady U r pretty Not as pretty as you Time for the shitty part. No, you worked hard! You deserve every penny. I'll miss seeing you every day, getting more and more beautiful. Text me whenever you want, miss. When you're bored... It does not fall on deaf ears. Thanks. I'm excited to get things decorated and painted. For me, that's the part I find meditative. I'll paint it all red. That'll be the base. I'll put a black chandelier there with crystals. They'll catch the light. In China, red is happiness and strength. Red is passion, too. It didn't go through. Oh, really? -Try again. -Yeah. No. I don't know what's going on. I feel really bad about this, but can I pay you in a few days? What will you give me for security? What do you want? Your panties. My panties? -The ones I'm wearing? -Yeah. Okay. Slowly. Here. Put them in a plastic bag. AUGUST Hey girlfriend. I'm stuck in traffic and I missed the exit. It's pretty damn far, your freaking house. I got four boxes of pizza. I'll be there soon. Wait for me, okay? Don't open your eyes! Okay, go! Holy shit! Fuck you! The crystals in your light look so rich! That must have cost a chunk of change. No, not bad. Our lady contractor was very accommodating. Josée? Yeah, it was really inspiring to see a woman working like that. Yeah, inspiring. It must've been a change from all those construction dudes who just want to sleep with you. These square plates look so modern. It's really coming along! Still sleeping in the living room? Just for the renos. It's easier like that. We're used to it. But it's almost done. I'd like to give Jo a New York theme for the bedroom, all in yellow. Because yellow means strength. -It's really good for sex. -That's right. I found a bunch of stuff for it, pillows and blankets and lamps, but shit, they're not giving it away. It's like we have less money than before. And Josée wasn't free. Hey, you should sign up for Déco à Go? Go! It won't cost a thing and you'll be on TV. Yes! That's a great idea! And the show designer is great, she makes dreams come true. She'll love your New York theme. That sexy handyman will drill in your room! That guy must have the ladies lining up. -I thought he was gay. -No, he's not gay! Come on, it's not clear at all. Gay or not, he must fuck non-stop. -He's got three kids. -No more fucking, then! You don't fuck when you have kids! You do arts and crafts. Now? Hi, I'm Sarah Ménard. My guy Jonathan and I have just bought our dream home, and we'd love to get some help for the bedroom of our dreams. I'd love to offer my man a New York themed bedroom. He's crazy about New York, but he's never been there. Jo never really knew his parents, he was never able to travel. Now with the new house, we won't have the cash to travel for a while. So it'll be a way to bring New York here to us. So that's it, we'd love your help, Sugar and I. Was that okay? That's better. We can see the disaster. The disaster? Come on. It's a fucking disaster, Sarah. Don't try to tell me different. It's like you're in a fantasy film gone wrong. Okay, now go. But be more yourself. -More me? -More you. No bullshit. Good evening. Hello. Hi, my name is Sarah Ménard and I'm 32 years old. I'm a new homeowner with my boyfriend, Jonathan. It's our dream house. And we'd like... Actually, it's not our dream house. It's the only house we could afford with our jobs. We were going to re-do it in our own style, but it's horrible, it's costing an arm and a leg. We wanted to save money, but that bit us in the ass. In four months, we've just done the kitchen and the bathroom. Twice. Twice for the bathroom because... Never mind. And now we have to finish it quick, because... I can't hide it much longer. I'm pregnant. The money isn't coming in as fast as my ideas. My boyfriend does his best, but he's not a handy kind of guy. I overestimated him a little. I'm not easy to live with either, these days. There's a lot going on in my head, and I wonder if buying this house wasn't a mistake. My parents have been pressuring me for years to start a family and get a house and all that. But my parents... They've lived in Florida for 10 years and never had a second thought in their life. Sometimes I wonder if they like my dog better than me. I haven't even told them yet that I'm pregnant. I wanted to tell them in person, they don't want to come back here. Their dream life is there now. And we don't travel. Jo and I have never been on a plane. We were supposed to go see them last year, but then the hurricanes... We had to cancel. Anyway. That's it. The debts are piling up, the baby's on its way, and I'm freaking out. Maybe if we didn't live in a dump, I could start believing that this is our dream. It's just hard. I've been watching your show ever since it's been on the air, and everyone always seems so happy. I beg you, come save us. Was that okay? If they don't pick you, they're fucking idiots. You're looking fancy this morning. Did I forget a special date? No. I just felt like looking nice. You're beautiful. You're always beautiful. Gotta go, there's a union meeting at work today. I can't be late because... Sure, no problem. See you tonight? Okay. Well, have a nice day. You too. No. No. Not that one. I'll give you 700 for this and 300 for this. Seven hundred! This is first edition, it's worth at least a grand. I know, but it doesn't go with my deck. It's a nice card, but I'm not paying a thousand for it. Eight hundred. Because it's you. It's a buyers' market. You can't sell your whole deck like that. I don't know what else to do. I've been bringing my resume around. I'm always either underqualified or overqualified. For real? They fuckin' want to hire Chinese children they can pay three cents an hour. You, overqualified? You're not overqualified for anything. I know. You have average competence. You're pretty ordinary. Fucking rotten capitalist system. Yeah. I might have something more your speed that will get you out of the shit really fast. I have some friends looking for a place to store things in the long term. A place? A kind of hole. A hole that hypothetically could exist in a house under renovation. A hole over which could be poured a nice new concrete floor. You get the kind of hole I'm talking about? Yeah. Nothing wrong with offering a hole to some friends, eh? That's true. Sarah, today we'll transform the bedroom you share with your guy. That's right. Let me say that Jonathan hasn't had a lucky life. He never knew his parents. He was abandoned by an alcoholic mother and an unknown father. And you told me he's never had the chance to travel. That's true. Today, we're going to offer him the room of his dreams, inspired by the colours of a city he's always wanted to see, a.k.a. the Big Apple. That's what we call armchair travelling! Sarah, you know our handyman, the lovely Jean-François, and our star interior designer, Daphné. Of course I do. Daphné, you were inspired by Sarah's ideas. Yes. You want a bedroom with a New York theme. Great idea! I went looking and I found some amazing treasures. We'll start by emptying the room. Jean-François, you're going to make a headboard out of MDF that I custom-designed with an alcove and LED lights. Great, Daphné. I'll get busy. We'll paint the walls taxi yellow with a black ceiling. Don't be nervous, it will give the room an industrial flair. As well, dark ceilings make a room seem larger. I have lots of surprises that you'll see at the big reveal! -Great, I'm excited! -Me too. We have no time to lose. Because you're pregnant, Sarah, you should save your strength. Usually the participants work on the renos with us. But let's get started, because we have to be done before Jonathan gets home at 6. Are you ready? Déco à Go? Go! Sarah, we have a little surprise for you. The team called up your mom, who wanted to offer you a present for your room. -Hi sweetie! -Hi. Marie, since your retirement, you've been learning to paint and you sent us one of your pieces. Yes, it's a painting of New York with lots of yellow. Yellow is the colour of success. New York is such a timeless city. You're getting good, eh? Thanks, mom. Sarah, you have a little surprise for your parents as well? Go on, tell them your secret! Well, I guess me and Jo... I'm pregnant. Oh my god! Oh sweetie, that's the best news you could ever give me. Now I get why you look so much heavier. We thought you looked bigger in your photos. You should have told us before! Yeah, but I wanted to tell you in person. But you never come to see us. And my little Sugar, are you there too? Yup. My little Sugar. Guy, do you have anything to say? Yeah! We'll come see you. It'll give us a good reason to come back to Quebec. You'll need help with a little one. It's not so easy to take care of a baby. You'll find it hard, sweetie. It's a lot of self-sacrifice. That's great, but we have a lot of work to do before Jonathan gets home. -Thank you Guy and Marie. -No probl... Hello? Yes, that's me. Here he is. -Jonathan! -Yes? Your girlfriend contacted us to offer you the gift of the bedroom of your dreams. The whole team of Déco à Go? Go! worked hard today on a very special transformation. Sarah? No more sleeping in the living room. Are you ready for a big surprise? -Yeah. -Okay, go! This is why you were all done up this morning? Did I do something wrong? No, Jo, you didn't do anything. As usual. The bank called this afternoon. When I call ''Go on in", you open the door and you go in. Okay. And it's important to name the objects around you. It will help us with editing. If you're talking about curtains, say the word "curtains". If you like the lamps, say "The lamps are nice." And we won't film it twice, so try to seem happy the first time. Yeah. Gotta put your game faces on, because it might be screening on TV for the next ten years. You told me you were paying the bills! Was that a lie? I'm sorry babe, it's just... I didn't want to stress you out, with the baby... To stress me with what? I lost my job. You lost your job? Fuck, when? Two months ago. Two months? Go on in! Jonathan, do you like your bedroom? Wow. It's New York. Yeah. To channel the atmosphere of your favourite city, we used adhesive wall decals of iconic scenes. Look, the curtains are great, eh babe? Yeah, the curtains. It echoes of the zebra print in the kitchen. Also, in the MDF headboard built by Jean-François, our handyman, you have built-in LED lighting that changes colour to recall the lights of Times Square. Oh wow, the lights. And finally, we know that renos aren't easy or cheap, especially with a baby on the way and plans for a trip to New York. The team wanted to give you a little present. We're offering you a gift certificate for a photo shoot at a professional studio to record this time with your baby bump. Wow, a photo shoot! Thanks to the whole team! Great work by Jean-François and the talented Daphné. Jonathan and Sarah, we wish you happiness in your new bedroom! We'll see you next week for another transformation on Déco à Go? Go! You're just a fucking coward and a liar. Did you lie to me when we started dating? I was a sap. "Look at that dumbass bitch dating that dumbass liar." I never lied to you, babe. It's the only time, I swear. Fuck, we're $30 grand in debt and we have a mortgage we can't pay because you have no job! You act like a fucking teenager and you're a fucking liar! How can I trust you now? How can I fucking trust you? You haven't made an effort in years! That's not true. Fuck, Jo. You don't make an effort for me. You put on 40 pounds in two years. You think I like how you look? I'm the only one trying here, and it's fucking exhausting! -I can't just tell you what to do. -Sorry. Shut up or I'll give you something to be sorry about! And although I live far from your sun I despise my nights I hate my awakenings When you left it hurt like a knife in my skin I'm not backing out when I say I love you I won't spend my life hiding my pain Go up and sing a song, it'll perk you up. I don't have a song. What would you tell your girl if she was here? I miss you. That's a good one. Cue it up. Thanks Mélanie-Kim. A round of applause. Next up, La Chicane's I Miss You with the handsome Jonathan. Ladies, give him a hand. Turn on the lights Close the door, there's a draft Tell me harsh words Tell me soft words Tell me everything you want to hear Bring your cards We'll play until you leave Tell me funny things Tell me boring things Do what you want I don't want you to leave I miss you We have lots of things to say After the rain comes good weather But the storm can last a long time Tell me a story Like you do so well Tell me about that time Tell me about the other time Tell me anything at all Play me the guitar Play it even if it's late Make me laugh Make me sing Then after you can go I miss you We have lots of things to say After the rain comes good weather But... Close the curtains You can see my eyes full of tears Don't look at me Don't talk to me I won't cry if you don't leave After the rain comes good weather But the storm can last a long time Jim, if your guys are still looking for a hole, I'm in. Thank you, Jonathan. Next up is Marie-Pierre singing Every Cry, Each S.O.S. Hello lovely! Been a while. What u doing? I'm touching myself Mmmm show me I'd love to see you Hello? I'm not with Jo anymore You make this on your own? Yeah, but it takes months. You have to make the links one by one. You made this on your own but you can't manage a fucking home reno? And who's the character? Galdèche. A former butcher who became a warrior. He inherited the axe of Servert the Conqueror. Only he can use it, anyone else catches on fire. Unless they're wearing the Glove of Bulgur. That's hot. The Glove of Bulgur? It's an artifact. Here, look. Put it on. Now you can hold it. Here they are. Jo, this is Tattoo and Eric. Boys, this is Jo. This is Sugar, and this is his house. Where do we put the package? Downstairs. Turn around. It won't make the turn. Fucking house full of fucking corners. Drop it. Fucking shit. For fuck's sake. Chill the fuck out, you're not the one who killed him. No, the deal's off. You said it was things. That's not things, that's someone! -Calm down, Galdèche. -Piss off with your Galdèche. I'm out. Wrap it back up and get it out of here. You see how fat this guy is? I don't care, deal with it! You don't understand. You can't back out of a deal like this. There's no way I'm burying this guy here. I'm not living on top of a dead body. You can shut your fucking trap. This fat fuck is going in a hole right here. That's it, that's all. So... the hole? Where do we dig? You can take it from here. You're not doing it with me? Why do you think we're paying you a hundred grand? So you can watch us do it? Fucking lazy ass. You're all the same. You want money, but you don't want to work for it. But I don't know how. Look on the internet. It has everything. You don't need to know anything. Here, you can fix all your problems with this. Don't put it in the bank. Good job, Galdèche. Welcome to this new video by Reno-Tips: How to pour a concrete floor. When you start, make sure your floor is level. With dirt and 3/4 down gravel, prepare a foundation. Slowly add one part water to six parts concrete mix, making sure to mix well until smooth. Then pour the concrete. Level it immediately. Let it dry and contemplate your work. Congratulations, you did it! OCTOBER Babe, I've been texting you loads but you don't answer. I have to talk to you about Sugar. It's important. I love you. You okay? No, I'm all seized up right here. That's from too much phone. Happened to me too, when I was on the apps. Too much sexting. One hand on the phone, the other in the pants. I got all seized up here. I was texting with 30 or 40 guys, 10 or 15 girls and two non-binaries at the same time. Takes a fuck ton of management. With the girls, it was longer. Like, more erotic. That's how I got seized up. Endless texts! It was worse with the guys. They'd send a picture of their dick like it was a golden nugget. They come in three seconds, no time to get a stiff neck there. One of the girls, what turned her on was to meet a stranger, not say a word and eat her pussy. So she came over. Came in and didn't say a word. She made me come four or five times with her tongue on the sofa, then she left without a word. Gotta be careful with oral if you're pregnant. If you get blown too hard, it goes up to the uterus and that's dangerous for the baby. I'd never been eaten like that before. But I have a theory. I think that guys blow better than girls. I'm not there anymore. I'm euphoric. It's like people who take real drugs. Coke, crack, anything. I can't live without it. My first bite, it was... It's over. It's the wheel that's turning and turning... But where's your life in all of that? Jo's not the sharpest pencil in the box, but he's still a good guy. Then, you just look in the mirror. Text him. Is that what you want? To be fat? I'm unhappy. I could even have a panic attack just from looking at myself. I hate myself, really, but I'm making it. I got the nicest urn they had. Thanks for doing that, babe. I wouldn't have had it in me. She was a good dog. She died peacefully. Are you serious? -You did this yourself? -Yeah. You? You did this? That's impressive! And that's not all. What the heck? Where is this from? The union negotiated a better severance package. Two years of pay. Not possible. I've never seen so much cash in my life! Oh yeah. You're so beautiful, babe. Holy shit, that's hot. Oh yeah. It's been so long. Be careful not to blow into my vagina. Why would I do that? I dunno, but be careful. Apparently it's bad for the baby. I wouldn't blow into your vagina. Okay, but I'm wet enough anyway. I'll go on top, it'll be more comfy. Look into each others' eyes. Like that, that's great. Big smiles now. Chin down, sir. That's it. And show your teeth. You got teeth? That's it, sir! Now from the side, lean into him, stick out your belly, perfect. Look over here, this way. Sir, your teeth. Yes sir, you got it. This is great, fantastic. Sir, the time is now. -Go on, you can do it. -Now? What is it? Go on, that's it. Babe, the ordeals of the past few months haven't been easy. I haven't been the best boyfriend. I'm sorry I lied to you. I'll never forgive myself, but I hope you'll be able to forgive me. Fantastic! These last months have made me see that I want to face life with you. That's it, sir. I want you next to me always. I'll always be your knight. And I'll try to be better. Really. For you. Sarah, will you be my princess forever? I haven't been very nice these last few months either. I've been freaking out. Jo, you're such a good guy. Yes, I want to marry you. Oh my god. One more, this way! I saw a really nice stroller. The Babygaloo 6. $850, I hear it's the best. That's great. And maybe we should get a new car. Something a bit bigger. Babies need a lot of stuff. Like an SUV. Maybe a hybrid. We have to start thinking of the planet. You're right. I love you, babe. I love you too. Must have been dirt and grease building up inside the pipe. Probably formed a blockage. And with a blocked line in, the oil takes longer to circulate, the furnace works harder. It has to pump more than usual. If you don't have it looked at, it can give out. You'll start by soaking up the oil on the floor. Try to clear it up or your house will be all greasy. Then we'll come in and take care of the contaminated waste. Then we'll dig to get under the concrete. What for? The concrete wasn't even finished properly. I don't know who you got to do this, but don't hire him anymore. I hope it didn't cost you too much. Looks like a lot of oil seeped into it. That's no good, you don't want to live on contaminated ground. It's dangerous and ends up stinking up the place. Okay so you'll dig up to here? No. To make sure, we'll have to dig at least up to here. 1313 Bar. Hi Jim, it's Jo. I have a problem with the hole. I have to dig up the package. Motherfucker. Seriously, I can't believe how mature and involved Jo is now. He's so much more relaxed since he's been off work. We don't even realize it, but it's so fucking stressful to work all the time. That's for sure. Now, I dunno, it's like he's more grounded. But everything is easier when you have money. Even the oil damage, I'm not stressing about it. No, it's just a last little bump, and then... the wedding. Well, I hope it doesn't turn out like with Kelly's brother. Kelly, the zumba teacher. Her brother was getting married last summer, an exotic wedding. They chose a tropical island. They're rich, so they rented a private jet to bring the family. There was Kelly and her boyfriend, the bride's brother, the parents, grandparents, cousins. And then the plane crashed. Okay, and? And what? The plane crashed and...? Well, they all died. And you just have 15 grand left. Jesus, we just buried him. It goes fast. Did you see what had to be done here? The baby will be here soon. Life is expensive. You're telling me. Like I didn't know that that life is fucking expensive. How long do we have? They're coming at noon. And your girlfriend? She's at a motel spa with a friend, they'll be back tomorrow. Nice fucking job. Seriously, I didn't think you had it in you. Which one d'you want? This one. C'mon, go! C'mon, fucking lift it. Lift! Jesus holy fucking shit. You owe me big time from now on. Already? -Calm the fuck down. -What do we do? Shut up! Good thing we're getting it out, it's starting to smell like rot. You don't have to stay here. This will take a while. Yeah, but my buddies wanted to see how you were going to do it. We'll finish our game after. What's this? A rat. From now on, you answer your phone whenever I need a favour. Got it? I'm not cut out for a life of crime. Shoulda thought of that before. Good thing we have good insurance. There are a few things that we can't replace, but once we're done with this, we'll be fine. Come on, babe. Just one last stretch before the end, then it's done. I know, it's just... I'm just tired. It's like we'll never be done with these renos. We're almost there. Almost done. DECEMBER Sweetie, we're at the airport. We're about to board. A thousand bucks for two tickets, that's a pricey shower! You can't say that we never did anything for you. Where'd you find that? I went shopping! Serious shopping. They have nice things for kids there. -Thanks. -That's real leather, eh? What's this? A breast pump. They're super useful. I'm gonna look like a cow. Stop it! No, it's really practical. When your breasts are full, you'll be damn happy to have it. And you have little nipples. Maybe Zoe won't latch on. Mom, not in front of everyone! Fuck, Sarah, we know you have small nipples. We don't give a shit. Exactly. No big deal, sweetie. Thanks. A speech? Yeah! Speech, speech, speech! Okay! A year ago, if you'd told me I'd be living my dream life, I'd have said, "Of course I will!" No, just kidding. It's been harder than I thought with the house, the renos, the relationship, the debt. I almost gave up. But life was kind to us. The house is perfect. Our relationship is perfect. Little Zoe will be perfect. And all of you, you're all perfect! Living the dream! Anyway, I'm happy to have you as a son-in-law. Thanks, Guy. I love your daughter more than anything. I'd do anything for her. I can see that. And I know it's not easy for you young folks today. Not easy. What with overpopulation, climate change, debt, the internet, disease. Everything's about to explode. I can't believe we're still letting people have kids. Maybe it'll be your little girl who saves the world. To the firstborn of Galdèche, the butcher turned warrior. Long live your lineage, my friend. Well. Yeah, Sarah didn't want me late for dessert. Don't forget your bag. What's in there? Clothes for the child of Galdèche. I can't believe you never told me that Sugar died. I have so much going on, I forgot. Forgot? I'm happy for you two. Thanks. Police! Put your hands up! No! I didn't do anything! It wasn't me, I swear! I'm sorry! I didn't kill him, I just buried him! I swear! Jonathan Tardif, you're under arrest for homicide and defiling a corpse. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you. What the heck? You have the right to legal counsel. Do you understand? Yes. Jo! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What the fuck is going on? Leave her alone, she has nothing to do with it. What are you talking about? What is this about? I'm sorry, babe. Move along now. You too, get out of here.
