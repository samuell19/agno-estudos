Go for it. Just go! We'll go after you. Twenty-seven... ...28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34... Thirty-four seconds. All right, I'll go. Twenty-eight, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45. My God! Forty-five seconds. Forty-five. That's crazy. Final score, 34 to 45. What do you want? Give me your foot. Don't do that, man! So, when's your birthday? It's really this Sunday? BITATÉ: Nobody tells me anything. BITATÉ, IN PORTUGUESE: These days, there are about 180 Uru-eu-wau-wau. We're growing a little. - It's going to break. - No, it won't. Ah. BITATÉ: Non-Indigenous people always say the same things. "Indigenous people have too much land," blah blah blah. "You need to clear the trees and raise cattle," but I don't agree. This forest and its rivers are our home. They support us. BITATÉ: Are you crazy? Why did you let go of the rope! This guy is nuts! Walk this way, Neidinha. - Are you tired? - No, I just stubbed my toe. Oh, no. BITATÉ: I've known Neidinha since I was born. She's been willing to risk her life alongside us Indigenous people. I consider her like a second mother. Let's get this drone up, Bitaté. It's all deforested. Everything's gone. It's so ugly. Dragons eat the forest Now nothing will grow And those who live within it Where can they go? If this forest had feet I'll tell you what It would've run, my friend Before the trees were cut If I'm elected... ...NGOs won't get any money. Every citizen will have a firearm in the house. There won't be one more inch of Indigenous reserve. There's much you don't know, Bitaté. You have to learn how things used to be. During first contact, they approached us offering gifts. Pots and pans, things like that. If that hadn't happened, we wouldn't be here, living in the midst of these White people. I spent the first half of my life in the forest. You could walk forever and only find trees. BITATÉ’S GRANDFATHER: My father was a shaman. BITATÉ’S GRANDFATHER: One night, he had a nightmare. BITATÉ’S GRANDFATHER: He warned us of the outsiders. BITATÉ’S GRANDFATHER: After contact, they brought diseases. More than half our people died. There's a group of us the White people never reached. They're still uncontacted, living deep in this forest. Grandpa, do you ever worry about our people disappearing? Of course, I'm scared of that. I tell young people how things used to be, but not everybody will listen. I want to listen. It's up to the next generation now. FEMALE VOICE, IN PORTUGUESE: We begin today with the elections. Presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro remains in the lead. We are seeing invasions on protected lands, and the assassination of Indigenous people. Indigenous leaders claim that this wave of attacks is being incited by Bolsonaro's hateful rhetoric. SÉRGIO: For those who live here, the Brazilian dream is to own some land, and make your living from it. I'm 49 years old, and I've spent my whole life working other people's land. SÉRGIO: I've always said someday I'll get my own. Dig that one first. SÉRGIO: I can't stop drinking water. This heat could kill you. We just sat down and already have to get up. It's different in the forest. It's cooler there. The forest isn't like this. SÉRGIO: When you feel the suffering around you, you begin to realize what needs to change. The Uru-eu-wau-wau. They don't farm or create anything. They just live there. So, I think it's poorly divided. Mom, did you set the table? The table is almost ready. I always get scared when my mom goes to the villages. All I can ask is for her to be careful. I know it's her life's work, but I'm constantly worried. Hmm. Sometimes I don't even think she realizes. Hmm. She's always driving through logger towns, where she isn't welcome. When she's running late and we don't hear from her, I'm left thinking the worst. I don't live with fear. The only thing I'm scared of is something happening to my kids. But I'm not scared of loggers, or land grabbers. - I'm not scared of jaguars. - But you should be. You should be more careful. I'm serious. We've just received news that Jair Bolsonaro has been elected President of Brazil. Congratulations to the President Elect of Brazil. Democratically elected by millions of Brazilians, with a significant lead. - Bolsonaro! - Bolsonaro! They call this the border of the protected forest. It makes me sick knowing we're considered criminals, like we're the ones hurting the country. Every road in Brazil was created like this. First with a chainsaw, then a tractor. Eventually the government will support us, but only after we've done the initial work. This is how Brazil was created, and many other countries too. Look at this deforestation. They want me to call them now. - It's Ari. - There's been an invasion. We're leaving the village now to see what's happening. Ari, for God's sake, don't do anything that will put your life in danger. Don't go there alone, because you don't know how many people are there. You have to be careful with your life. My love, I have to leave for the Uru-eu-wau-wau. - Okay. - Okay, darling. I love you. I love you. Be careful, Mom. Your mother is always careful. The Bolsonaro government is giving the impression that anyone can invade Indigenous land and kick the Indians out, because now you're protected by the government. Can you hear me? Yes, there's an invasion at Uru-eu-wau-wau. Yes, an invasion of land thieves. Can you at least send people to inspect? Inspect what? Go and fight the loggers? Fight the invaders? There's nothing I can do. We have no resources. No one knows anything. The Indigenous Affairs agency is like shit in the water. Yes. Call everyone over here. Mmm. Alive, you see? That's the most important thing. Let's go, Ari. There are traces of people and motorcycles. Someone must have warned them we were coming. They won't attack now. - Uh-huh. - They're waiting for the right moment to come back. They have left for now, but this isn't over. We have to be ready when they come back. The Indigenous Uru-eu-wau-wau territory was targeted by a new invasion. The risk of a conflict between invaders and the Indigenous, worries this environmentalist. The risk of all this, is that people could die. There could be death on either side. Indigenous people could die, and so could the invaders. Unfortunately, the government is not protecting the territory, which is their responsibility. SÉRGIO: Around here, it's like an old Western movie. There's a group of pioneers that lead the way, then others come to settle the land. When I first arrived here, people were just saying, "Oh, this land is mine." I said, "Let's start an association so we can get some documents." That's how Rio Bonito began. Our association has to fight for the land... which they're saying is Uru-eu-wau-wau. The Promised Land, that's what people are calling it. My dream is about to come true. SÉRGIO: This square is my land. If we spread them out, we can fit more than a thousand families here. We'll plant some crops... to move our Brazil forwards. BITATÉ: Because this government keeps emboldening the invaders, the elders decided that it's time for me to become our leader. BITATÉ: I tried to wait, but the elders had the final decision, so I had to accept. BITATÉ: I want to work with Ari to improve our surveillance team. I really look up to him. Taking on a big responsibility like this, I'm scared of disappointing people. I'm 18 years old, almost 19. BITATÉ: The only thing saving our planet is our rainforest. I read that if it is all cut down, we could see five degrees of temperature rise. That would ruin the planet. I believe the Amazon is the heart not just of Brazil, but the whole world. How many animals die in these fires? We don't have a number. How many trees do we lose that could hold a cure to a disease? Nobody knows. They burn without thinking. Protecting the Uru-eu-wau-wau is beyond a shadow of a doubt how we will save the Amazon. The Uru-eu-wau-wau territory is like a barrier against deforestation. If the Uru-eu-wau-wau is cut down, we will lose the rest of the rainforest. This is the Association's home base. In a few years, we'll have a huge city here. God has blessed us. The invaders are using this wood to create the base for their Association, the Association of Rural Producers of Rio Bonito, within Indigenous territory. The Association of Rural Producers of Rio Bonito, founded in 2018. Many people go there to deforest and plant crops. Are you also lighting fires? Sure, you have to burn to clear the forest. And how do you avoid authorities? Ah, no one can control us. Only God can control this. Lord, we ask you to guide these men. We ask for wisdom for our Association leaders, so they can bring improvements for the people, oh Lord. - In Jesus's name. Amen. - Amen. Sérgio, the President of the Association, will speak now. Hello, everybody. Ninety percent of you already know me. I'm always trying to organize local farmers. I've been part of the leadership of this Association. In Rondônia, wealthy landowners dominate everything. I'm taking on this fight, but I know it's a risk. Our Association is registered and follows the law. We just have to survey and document our land. Thank you all for your attention. SÉRGIO: It's great to be president of the Association. The good comes with the bad. Things are getting serious now. I know there's some people already out there, but the judge will only give us access if we survey the area first. Mm-hmm. I'm just waiting until the lawyer speaks with the judge and we can liberate the land. We're doing everything by the books, so in the end it's all going to work out. Even though we burned here, it's still good. This is a pink cedar tree. I'm leaving it here because I'm going to build the roof of my house with it. We make the planks from it. I don't think you've heard about it. If you come back in October, it'll probably be ready. As long as the government doesn't let us live here with our families, we won't give up. If they arrest you, you have to pause because you're in jail, but as soon as they release us, we're back. Because I consider this land mine, you know? And if it is mine, I have to work on it, build on it. The Association is trying to get organized, but I can't wait for them. They won't enter until it's legalized. Many people believe in the Association. I only trust what I can do myself. Working, planting... trying to survive from here. But the Association... I don't believe in it. You should ask the traditional elder to speak first. I think I will begin, then ask him to speak next. No. Respect your elders, and the house we are in. You should start the meeting by asking the elders from each village to speak first. BITATÉ: Good morning everyone. Let's begin with our elder speaking. ELDER, IN KAWAHIB: I want to protect our land. Everyone is screaming, "Let's go there and invade!" They just want money. That's all it is. They tell us not to hurt anybody, then they trample us and take our lands by force. How can we live like this? We won't survive. BITATÉ: That's why we're here to talk and maybe write a letter to the authorities. We can't afford to just keep talking and talking. Things are getting worse, we need to act. I'm going to get my arrows and send them home. I can't accept this. Our ancestors were born from this land. Now the White people want more, and they're winning. At this rate, we'll all be living in the city. They are right in front of us. I hear a lot of us talking about killing White people. It's not worth killing them. It won't help. In the past, we used to have wars. Things have changed. Bolsonaro only puts his friends in power. We don't have a single politician supporting us, but the invaders have support. If we kill an outsider, they will not kill one of us. They will kill all of us. For a long time, I thought the way to fight invasions... was for the police to go and arrest the invaders. I'm realizing it doesn't work anymore. The police don't help us. We have to think of new strategies. This here is the Uru-eu-wau-wau territory. When did these problems in Indigenous areas start? These are very old problems that have just gotten worse. The process goes like this, - they send small farmers in first. - Mm-hmm. They say they're taking land because they're poor... but there are wealthy landowners financing these settlers, and eventually the big landowners take over. Thanks so much, we'll stay in touch. Mmm. Nice. There's only frosting left! We tried saving you a piece but you know how it is. Mom, they have guns. Tell them to let me go, please, Mom. Look, I don't know who you are, but I was just with my daughter. It's me, Mom, help! Go to hell. Gabriel, call her now. Are you calling her? I need to find her right now. Your provider informs, the cellphone you called is turned off or is outside the coverage area. Damn it, she's not answering. She's not responding, I'm going to find her. Be careful. Don't leave the doors open. This can't be possible. Kim? What's going on? They said they had you. They said they'd kidnapped you. I love you. If you're facing death threats, when one of us calls, you need to pick up immediately. I didn't know, it never rang. Time for some lunch? SÉRGIO: Every Sunday, people stop by. People want to know how things are going. Everyone is desperate to get into the land. I know we're missing the planting season, but we can't have people going there right now. If they get caught, the authorities will blame the Association. It's playing with fire. Their land is so huge anyways. There's so few Indians, why would they come our direction? Their land is so big they can't even walk it. I've never seen Indians there. - Have you, Pedro? - No. People say they're there, but I've never seen them. It's just talk. - What type of wood is that? - That's cedar. Pink cedar? We are building an example for people now, but also for people 20 or 30 years from now. Whoever is Catholic can have a Catholic church. The Evangelicals can have theirs too. With or without a road, by August I'm moving my family here. But a road is the next step to improve things. It's all coming. As the Bible says, people are meant to take the land and multiply. We just want what we deserve, nothing more. Just like everybody else. I believe we're on the edge of victory. There could be some arrests or something, but we're almost there. People are coming to claim their land. And if you don't claim it, someone else will. If you don't mark your spot, someone else will. I think lots of people are considering moving out here, those who really need it. Like me, I need it so I'm here. I can't be living hidden in the forest like an Indian. I've got to open up my land. I've always believed one day this would be mine, and today I believe it's mine. Today I have faith this land is mine. We just heard invaders are coming in and out of the territory now. Have you heard the latest message from Indigenous Affairs? This business of making up invasions is very complicated. I think this is all being made up. We have to go film them. We need a police escort, we can't go alone. The government won't respond unless there's proof. So, the motorcycle was here, but where was the body? Okay, I can see it on the grass. There's blood here. It's clear it was no accident. We begin with news about an Uru-eu-wau-wau man who was found dead on the side of the road. Ari Uru-eu-wau-wau, who was 33 years old was found dead this morning. The case has been classified as a homicide. We don't take other people's land. We respect everyone's lives and rights. The Indigenous guys told me it looks like he was beaten on the head and chin. I'm sorry. I completely understand. You were very close to him. I've known him since he was born. Thank you for all your help. Ari was a guardian of the forest. He was a forest protector... and he died for it. In the name of agrobusiness and the economy, they kill the forest and those who defend it. Dragons eat the forest Now nothing will grow And those who live within it Where can they go? Forest-dwellers, rubber-tappers Sloths, anteaters, and turtles too Running for their lives But what can they do? BITATÉ: Good morning. BITATÉ: Where is everybody? BITATÉ: Ari's murder has been a huge loss. I believe we're honoring him by continuing his work, protecting his land and his village. The other day, we used this to find some invaders. BITATÉ: As leader of the Uru-eu-wau-wau, my role is to bring connectivity to the villages. Are you paying attention? You never listen! You must be getting old. BITATÉ: The Association of Rio Bonito says they want our land, but I think they want more than that. They want us to disappear, including the uncontacted. We're not going to let that happen. I am insisting to the Indigenous Affairs agency that if these invaders keep entering, they will infect the Indigenous people. For the past 15 days, I've been trying to get medicine for them, - but I wasn't able to. - What happened? They all died of COVID. In twenty days, ten Cinta-Larga Indigenous people died of COVID. You know what that means? That's five percent of the Cinta-Larga people. Today, the Uru-eu-wau-wau are surrounded by invaders. They're threatening the villages, burning, cutting down trees, bringing coronavirus near the villages. It's a whole series of pressures, and the whole community is really vulnerable right now. The Uru-eu-wau-wau have a small population. If they get COVID, it would be like a genocide for them. BITATÉ: I spoke to the elders and we decided to close off our territory. BITATÉ: Today we're heading deep into our land. Because of COVID, we're creating our own media team. Okay, say something! I don't know what to say! BITATÉ: What do you expect from the mission? I think it's going to go well. We have to show that... Oh, I have to look that way. But why? BITATÉ: What are you expecting for tomorrow? I want to learn more about our land, and hear the stories of our elders. BITATÉ: A week ago, a journalist called me asking if he could send a video team to the village. I told him no need, we have all the equipment here. We can film it for you. We'll record it ourselves, you can pay us directly. Just send us your shot list, we've got it from there. BITATÉ: Let's go. BITATÉ: Behind the scenes. This is the making of. It looks like they brought a horse through here. Like I've said before, the government isn't doing its job. That's our reality, they're not. We're doing their work for them. We have the best weapons available today, and we're reclaiming the struggle of our elders. We're experiencing the same things they did... but they didn't have any of this. It was only their word, and no one believed them. These are their markings. They specify which direction they will begin cutting. They've cut a lot of trails through here. BITATÉ: It's smokey. Maybe they burned some brush. BITATÉ: Bust it. Go ahead. Let me in. BITATÉ: As we can see, we're in this area. These are the coordinates. We're clearly inside Indigenous territory. I think there's somebody up ahead. Go, go! - BITATÉ: You're under arrest. - Uh-huh. BITATÉ: We're not going to hurt you or do anything to you. - We have these bows and arrows... - Okay. - ...as part of our monitoring work. - Uh-huh. Can I check your backpack? Everyone knows this is Indigenous land. Who sent you? This is my first time, no one told me this was Indigenous land. I have some bullets in the bag. BITATÉ: Once this goes in, it doesn't come out. I'm just warning you. If you try any funny stuff we will use it. We don't want to do that. Not for you, and not for us. BITATÉ: Did you understand that, sir? We're giving you this mask to protect ourselves from COVID. We don't know what diseases you have. Who's got the sanitizer? Show me your hands, please. Let's go. Everyone stay alert. Due to a lack of trust in the authorities, Indians in Rondônia have formed patrols to protect their land against invaders. Where narrow trails make it hard to reach, it is possible to see from above. Drones have become an important tool for surveillance in the Uru-eu-wau-wau territory. The Indigenous have arrested around 30 invaders within their territory. They also burned down an invaders' camp. Do you see us breaking into your house? So, why are you invading our area? Bitaté is only twenty years old, but under his leadership the community has set up a patrol team to catch the invaders. We're going now to Bitaté Uru-eu-wau-wau. He is the president and leader of the Uru-eu-wau-wau. Indians from the Uru-eu-wau-wau are destroying a raft they found in their territory. I can't believe you're still filming! SÉRGIO: Don't slip, you'll spill the pesticides. The news coverage about Rio Bonito affected us a lot. The politicians were helping us because we were strong. They scratch my back, I scratch theirs. But due to the media, politicians are afraid to help us. It could dirty their name. One or two people are out there clearing land, so you prosecute everybody? In my mind, the law is totally wrong. So we're going to close the Association. It'll be everybody for themselves. I think man decided to go to the moon to find another planet. One that's similar to Earth. Because they can see the land is being destroyed. I'm saying "they," but really we're all human. Rio Bonito's over here. It's just beyond that horizon. Because I've been getting more death threats, I've had to put up huge walls around my house. They want to scare people so we don't speak up. But we cannot give up. If we give up, then they win. Ari was killed for defending his land, for defending the Amazon rainforest. What do you think, Mom? I'm just trying to keep it together. Hold me tight. There's lots I still want to do, and I know I don't have much time left. But in the time I have, I will mess with a lot of people. Poor them. If I live another 20 years, it'll be 20 years spent bothering anyone who destroys the Amazon. They burned everything. They burned it all. This is where my little house was. Now, it's just a pigsty. I'll be back. I'll build another house in the same spot. They burn one, I build another. BITATÉ: Do you want to learn to put the camera together? Here, come help me. - Here? - BITATÉ: Yeah. - Did it slide in? - Mm-hmm. BITATÉ: What's next? Attach this thing here. See? Turn it. No, look here, you need to line up the pins. Press here to start recording. Is the red light on? - Yeah. - BITATÉ: Good, you're recording then. That's it, nice wide shot. BITATÉ: It's important to record, because then you have a weapon. We have our own way of seeing things. Indigenous people have a very deep knowledge. I think that's what's missing from photography sometimes. Right now, there are more invaders than Indigenous people within our land. We aren't able to do this work alone. That's why we need the world to see what's happening here.
