Are you really leaving today? Are you really leaving today? I won't listen to this crap anymore. It's the same thing every year! Are you really leaving today? "Come along to Grandma's. Turn off the TV!" I'm fed up listening to you females... moaning about that Christmas garbage! - Hello, it's me. - Hi. I'm getting the earlier train. OK. Shall I pick you up from the station? No, don't bother. I'll get a taxi. OK, see you soon. - Are you all right? - Brilliant. - Is there a lot to tidy up? - A bit. OK. See you later. Bye. Laura? WINTER SLEEPERS Do you want some chicken soup? Coffee. Here. Why do you still go home? What have you been doing? Sleeping. Reading. Waiting. What for? You taste of sleep. You taste of car. New car? - Want to take a look? - Later. - Wait...the car. - Later. Are you driving? Are you kidding? I'm drunk. Well, then you've got a long way to go. What's wrong? I want to come, too. Don't start that again. I'm frightened. Why? In case she doesn't come back. Listen. Lizzy will get well again. That's why I'm taking her to the vet. Anyone there? Come on. Just one more hour. I can tell you're still tired. Luis to Dad. Come in. Come in. Luis to Dad. Over. - Luis to Dad. - Where's the damned thing? Come in. The sun. Are you OK? You were really lucky. Lizzy! Oh, God! Shit! Shit! Shit! What do you mean, you have to check? Who are "they"? You're the only one there? It must be terrible to be all alone. How do you manage to read the paper... drink the flowers, water the coffee... all by yourself? That's-- This can't be true. Why did I fall asleep? Don't worry. Some joyrider will probably dump it somewhere. - Yeah, sure. - What was in the car? Clothes, Christmas presents, all kinds of stuff. I gotta go. That guy must be on Valium or something. Becky, I'm taking your car. Hey, I have to go to work. OK, hurry up. Come on. Why did you leave the key in the car? You look fine. God loves you for a liar. Daylight never saw such a ruin! But you've put on weight. You're as plump as a partridge. You look good. Blanche! Yes, you do, or I wouldn't say it. But watch your figure. Look at my figure. Look at my figure. I haven't put on an ounce in ten years, Stella. I weigh what I weighed... the summer you left Belle Reve... - the summer... - Laura, come quickly. What's wrong? Internal bleeding and head injuries. - How did it happen? - A car accident. - Shit, I don't know if I can... - Sure, you can. You've got no choice. Come here. Hold this. Swab. Suck it up. I can't see anything. - We need more blood. Ligature. - Yes. When? No, when? Ten minutes ago. Thank you. He'll be here soon. You can sign in here. Sorry... - Well? - Forget it. If someone pisses on the slopes, they stage a manhunt... but a stolen car... It's like a UFO landing here: "A car? "A car with four wheels, or what?" Becky, the keys are in my pants' pocket. - Good morning. - Good morning. Thanks. OK, let's go. Max! Of you go! Next. I saw something... A car... It nearly crashed into me. At the last second, I swerved. It was all so sudden. There were these lines... Iike a snake. Where? Like waves. What are you looking at, you idiot? I can't remember! You'll have to be patient, I'm afraid. We have the situation under control... but there might be some damage to the skull and brain. We have to do a CT-scan, but we can't do it here. And we can't get a helicopter in weather like this. Can't you drive her there? It's too much of a risk. Her condition is critical. We might lose her then. Lose her? A coma. What's a coma, Dad? Go home and get some sleep. There's nothing you can do here. It was... It was like a snake. Shaped like a snake. Pardon? Has he been treated yet? No, I'm OK. It's nothing. Come on. Hello, sweetheart. I just can't get you out of my mind. I miss you. Really. Do you actually love me? Then come over here right now. I'll undress you, you'll undress me... - Why don't you answer? - Hello? - It's me. What are you doing? - Getting ready for the theater. Theater? Sure. It's Laura's opening night. - I forgot. - You promised to come. Yeah, but... - I couldn't stand it tonight. - Why not? I had my share of amateur dramatics today. You're mean. It's supposed to be really good this time. Can't we lie in bed and watch TV instead? How original. "A Streetcar Named Desire"... perhaps it's on TV tonight. Vivian Leigh instead of Laura Kirsch. Marco, I have to go, and I want to. - You can come here and watch TV. - Yeah? Yes, I'll tell Laura you're ill. Yeah? Yeah, see you soon. My God, they're full to bursting. Look at my figure. Look at my figure. Did you know that I haven't put on an ounce... in ten years, Stella? Please. Look at my figure. Did you know that I haven't put on an ounce... in ten years, Stella? I weigh what I weighed... How much do you think this exclusive casserole set costs? Precisely 499. - I'd say 300. - Let's have a look. No, sorry. This wonderful casserole set costs 499 marks. Sorry, Hilde. Better luck next time. Otto. Don't take it so hard. - Bye. - Bye. I'm going over there. Take care of him. I saw him applauding. - What's your name? - Rene'. Oh, yes. I'm Laura. - You work at the movie theater? - Yeah. - You're the...what's it called? - Projectionist. Yeah, right. - Don't do it. - What? Don't ask me. Ask you what? - Whether I liked it. - I wasn't going to. Well, did you like it? Yeah, it was really good. I thought so, too... I thought so, too. - What else do you do? - I'm a nurse. I'm a nurse. I'm better at nursing... - Better? - Better than at acting. God! I can't believe I'm in such a foul mood. Listen, you don't have to talk to me. I just didn't want to be rude. Hey, welcome. I can't find it. Oh, God, where are we? Go back the way we came. Take the next right. Are you OK? Turn left in the village. Well, thanks. Are you OK? I'll be OK. Thanks. Wait a second. Do you like to go to the movies? Not really. - Which movie do I have to see? - Anything you like. They're free tickets. Thanks. Amen. Are we getting a new horse, Dad? We're not going to make it. Not this time. What are you talking about? Everything. Wait! Laura! Wait for me! - Laura! - Come on! - Come on! - I'm thirsty! Shall we go to the movies tonight? The movies? I have free tickets. From that weird guy? He works there, doesn't he? Weird? He looks a bit strange, don't you think? Yeah. Did you talk to him? A bit. At least he gave you free tickets. Right. So do you want to come? I can't. Marco's coming. You don't like Marco, do you? Yes, I do. It's just that... I don't really understand what he wants. From me? No...just generally. Sometimes I don't know, either... if he's honest. Whether I can trust him. Take your time. You've only just met. OK, Mother. I'd like to know if it is love between Marco and me. What do you think? How should I know? Hi. What are you doing? Watching TV. Eating. Could you? Sorry. I'll put it back. Perhaps I should go to the movies after all. Oh, come off it. Stop cleaning up his mess. What do you mean? - Any news about your car? - Small-town cops. Forget it. Leave it. I'll do it. Take this, will you? - Wow! - Reflexes... Shit! We could spend some more time together. We could be closer. I mean... I could live here. You and I could do the ski courses together. I could show you around the country. We'd always be together. If I could live here, I wouldn't have to rent the place in town. You didn't sell yourself well as a prospective roommate. - What do you mean? - You should know! Gerd is still looking for new ski instructors. - I don't want to. - Why not? - I have enough to do. - You could earn a lot more. I earn just as much with the translations. "Forest Ranger's Love"... "Hour of Desire." You'd be a great ski instructor. But I don't want to. Ridiculous! - What? - Your attitude. You never try anything new. - What'll I tell Gerd? - What about? - Your refusal. Where did you get that idea anyway? - I told him. - What? For your sake. You'd earn twice as much. Thanks, but I'm grown up. Oh, yeah? Don't you ever want to achieve anything? You can talk! Huh? Your attitude makes me sick! What's the matter with you? I'm talking to you! If you don't take any advice... you'll never solve your problems! I don't have any problems! - Oh, yeah? - You have a problem! Sure. Typical. You are the problem! Your obstinacy is my only problem! - How come? - You aren't reliable. I have to smooth things out with Gerd! Sorry, but you got yourself into it! I don't get it. You don't want to change a thing. You only want to be left in peace. Make an effort. You know what's really ironic? That you can't stand your father... but you say the same crap as him! What do you know about my father? I just have to look at you to know everything. - What the hell's wrong with you? - Leave me alone! - You just want to hurt me! - Then cry! It's true! You enjoy hurting me! Ouch! Are you crazy? You look lovely when you're angry. Stop it! I'll love you... if you want. Oh, yeah? But don't boss me around. I don't want to boss you around. Then love me for a change, and stop annoying me. Then love me for a change. Sometimes you're so... Oh, no! Why did you go to that movie? Well, I think we're even now. Bye. I've finished work. Nervous... arrogant...vain... unkempt...unhealthy... self-satisfied... full of longing... spent... - strange. - Full of longing? - That annoys you. - No, arrogant annoys me. - And self-satisfied and vain. - Yeah. It's your turn. Reserved... frustrated...inhibited... hesitant...closed-up... pulled together... egocentric... not hungry. You don't want anything to eat? - Why egocentric? - I don't know. - Why do you think I'm strange? - Because you are. - You're not egocentric? - I don't know. Sorry, I actually ordered tea. Stupid, ugly, idiotic, blind, deaf, mute, moronic! Are you OK? You, of all people, drive me home! - To ease my guilty conscience. - Oh, dear. Everybody else was completely drunk. Theo? Go to sleep. As the moisture flowed into droplets... - Slaving away again? - What? What are you doing? Surprise. I moved out of my apartment. - You agreed. - I told you. I had to talk to Laura first. It's her house. - But there's so much space here. - Yeah... But you're not very easy on her. - What do you mean? - You know. You don't like Laura, and you don't try to hide it. That's mutual. Exactly. A great basis, huh? Shit. - You aren't pleased. - Yes, I am. Yes, I am. Really. I'll talk to Laura later, OK? I am. It's just that you're sometimes... What? I'll finish this quickly, OK? Here. I put a vitamin pill in it. A vitamin pill. - Shall I let in a little light? - No, please don't! It's better this way. - I wanted to ask you out. - Oh, yeah? - To dinner. - To dinner? - Don't you want to? - Yes, dinner. OK. It's you. - You don't like it, do you? - No, it's different. - You didn't even recognize me. - Sorry, I was daydreaming. - Well? Black coffee as always? - Yeah. What were you thinking about? I forgot. I think it was important. - I know the feeling. - No, not like that. - I have a problem here anyway. - Yeah? What is it? You won't tell me. I'm hungry. We can go to my place. - Who did you inherit it from? - My great- aunt. She was great. She loved collecting things. She hooked a rich building speculator... and traveled. This was her depot. - Her depot? - So to speak. You'll see. The whole family died of envy, and in the end... everyone came away empty-handed. Almost everybody. Yeah. She saved my life. Just because you went shopping once! OK, OK. Forget it. - If I'd only known before. - What? That you're such a great roommate. Where are you going? What? I have to pee, you dumb cow! Or maybe not. Hello. Good-bye! Shit! Just a minute. Great. Just stay in bed. Leave me alone! It's great the way you sell yourself. Why me? You're the one who yelled. You can't eat up everything in the fridge. Why not? I bought the food. Why do I have to sell myself anyway? Because you want to live here, you bum. You're nuts. Why don't you stay here? Would it bother you if Marco lived here a while? No, why? He asked me. I'd like him to stay. Yeah, sure. Why not? - What are you doing? - What do you think? What? Why? I don't want to have to sell myself. Don't worry. I've done it for you. Thanks. But no, thanks. Stay here! After all the trouble I went to! I don't want trouble! I just want to live here! You're nuts! Yeah, sure. You cry, and it's all my fault. I'm not crying. You don't even want me to live here. Do you really think it's a good idea? Sure. Why? - Why, why? - Yes, why? - Why not? - Why should you? It'd be good. We'd be together. - But we're always arguing. - That's not true. Do you really like being with me? Sure. What about you? No. All you want to do is fuck me. - Right? - You're nuts. Yeah? Oh, God, you're difficult. Dad! That's it. A scar. It was a scar. - The guy had a scar like this. - What guy? The guy in the other car, damn it! What other car? You slid off the road. It was icy, and you skidded. These things happen. Stop fooling yourself. There's nothing you can do. It's a hopeless case. The man is finished. His farm is bankrupt. His daughter is in a coma. There's nothing you can do. They've done nothing. No investigation, nothing. Alexa, I know we went halves on the car. I'm just as annoyed as you. Yes, exactly. How am I supposed to know? You're the lawyer... A female lawyer, yes. Stop it. You know how much I'd like to. You couldn't. Yes, I love you, too. Yes, absolutely. Yes, I swear... on the head of my mother and yours. May they all drop dead if I break my oath. Still here? I thought you were already... I thought you were already on the slope. - Yes. - Who is it? Yes, yes. I couldn't talk. Forget it. I'm in Gerd's office. The phone's been disconnected. I'll call you, OK? I just called you, didn't I? Yes, OK. Yes, I kiss you...all over. OK, bye. May I? Listen. You're still there? - Yes. I'm reading. - What? Tennessee Williams. Yours is the most difficult part. We're on tomorrow... eight reservations. Bravo! - Do you have to work tonight? - No, not on New Year's Eve. Why not stay there until I come? OK. See you later. Becky! Is this yours? Your car? Yeah, it was my car. - And no trace? - Of the thief? That would be good. Are you alone? Yeah, I was looking for cigarettes. I've run out. Just a minute. - Has Rebecca gone yet? - No, she wasn't here yet. Here. Do it yourself. Becky? What are you two doing? Hello. Hello. We need matches. In the kitchen. Sure. - Can you get it? - Yeah. I can manage them, too, Gerd. I'm at Becky's. OK, bye. - Do you like him? - What? - Do you like Rene'? - What do you mean? What do you think I mean? Do you find him nice, likable, attractive? Attractive, no. Nice, sort of. Likable, yes. Is that why you smiled at him? - What? When? - Just now. Are you joking? I just said, "Hello." Exactly. "Hello." - You're nuts. - I keep my eyes open. Ridiculous. What's that? My New Year's Eve dress for tonight. Shit! It's gone! It's gone! It's gone! Are you all right? Do we have a date? No. Shit. We had some kind of date... - I think. - That was yesterday. Yesterday? You wanted to wait for me. At my place. New Year's Eve. Yesterday? - Have you noticed it before? - Yes, sure. It was an accident. An exercise when I was in the army. - In the army? - I got too close... to an exploding grenade... - and it went into my brain. - Ouch. And something was damaged. My short-term memory... is screwed up. Yeah? What does that mean? I still know who I am... where I come from, etc. But what happened yesterday, for example... No idea at all. I have to keep track somehow if my head isn't able to. When I look at the photos, I can recall things. Most of the time. Without the photos, it's gone. Everything? It's all jumbled up. I remember some things. - Rebecca! - Yes? It's for you. Your father. Dad? Yes. Be more careful. Take it a bit slower. Or you'll break your neck. Hey, Marco! - Yes? - Rebecca's gone home. Her grandmother died. - Oh, shit. - Right. I have to go away, too. Could you look after my house for a few days? Sure. I can't find it. It's strange you can't find the light switch... at your own swimming pool. OK, you win. It's not my pool. But at least we're here. I just partly lost. That's right. And now? What do you think? Who does this belong to? A friend who's earning money on your ski course. Come on. It's included in the price. It's great. - Is anyone at home? - Yes. Hi. Hello. I didn't know you were coming back today. Sit down. "Coffee?" "Of course, my darling." "Would you like an espresso or a cappuccino? "Or a cafe' au lait or the whole macciato?" "Che'rie, don't ruin the machine." "Could these hands destroy anything, che'rie?" Nobody believes you. Nobody in the whole town. And you? You'll see. I'll get that bastard! Somebody will recognize him, his scar. No, they won't. Nobody will see it. I followed you and took them all down... the posters. But why? I was so ashamed. Everybody thinks you're crazy. They think you won't admit... it's your own fault. OK, get set. Hurry up. Rene'? It's me. I can't make it. - Is it something bad? - Yes, it is. It's important. Are you coming to the party at the bar? Perhaps, but this could take a while. - OK. - I have to go. Would you like something to drink? No. How's it going? I don't know. You must be patient. It might take a while. I'll drive you home. One of us has to look after the children. - Hi. What happened? - I burned myself. And some dirt got into it. - Let me do it. - OK. Hi. You have to be careful. Throat wounds can be dangerous. It hurts. - What's wrong with you? - Why? You really look bad. There's a child dying in the next room. - Where's the father? - He'll be back soon. Get her ready. Clean her up and everything. She looks unreal somehow. I wonder if life really has to be so long. Perhaps she had three good years out of ten. Have you had three good years? I don't know. I don't know, either. It all depends on how you look at it. Three is quite a lot. I'll go before her father gets back. Shit. I didn't cry at the funeral... and now I can't stop. That's OK. I'm glad you're here. Does it hurt? Thanks for the meal. You did the cooking. Am I interrupting you? - Hello. - Hi. I just collapsed. - You collapsed? - Yes, from the whole... I'll make some coffee. Want some? - Yes, please. - No, thanks. You look awful. When did you get back? A couple of hours ago. What's that? Nothing. I burned myself on the coffee machine. How was it? Depressing. So few people. My mother was merciless. She sold everything: the house, the land... For how much? How much did she get for it? I don't know, Marco. A lot. I thought about you while you were gone... quite a lot. Didn't you? - Here. - Thanks. I suppose you'd rather stay in tonight. No, I'll be fine in a minute. I'll let you know when I'm going. - You can see how you feel. - OK, thanks. Are you going out? To the party at Sleeper's Bar. Want to come? No, I have to clean up at Gerd's place. - Why don't you come afterwards? - If you like. But perhaps you'd rather be alone with Rene'. What are you doing tonight? Going to a party. - A party? - Yes. I'm really in the mood. I'm going to the toilet. - Are you OK? - Yeah, I think so. - Isn't Marco coming? - Doesn't look like it. Will you dance with me at least? Whew, I'm exhausted. Hi, it's you. I thought you weren't coming. You're a really great guy! Oh, yeah? Is that guy in there great, too? - God, you're really pitiful! - I don't give a damn! What's the matter with you, you idiot? No, no. You keep asking me that! What's the matter with you? You're hurting me! You stupid idiot! You've ruined everything! What? Your lovely affair? Oh, I'm sorry! You are so stupid! What affair? - Are you stupid? - No. On the contrary. Great. You really messed things up this time. You don't love me anymore. Get in, or I'll drive away. OK, let's talk. What are you thinking? Laura? Hello. Where were you? I went out to get something. What's wrong with you? I was at the pharmacy. I think I'm pregnant. OK, you're the one. OK? It's difficult. - Down that way? - Yes. Great. But be careful. Not too fast. Wait! Let me go first! Yes, maybe. But where did they go? I only know they went up the ski lift. - Where? - Up there. - The ten greatest disasters. - OK, you start. Having children. Living together. Getting fat. Being bored. Watching TV. Not having sex. Getting old. Stinking and dying! Nina! No, please... Please, no! Come on, let's go. Keep going. We've just moved in. That's why there's no fridge or bathtub. - Do you have a phone? - Yes, we do. I'm afraid something might have happened to him. The fog was really heavy. I'm sure he's looking for me. You're right. Hold this tightly. I'll call the police. They should send someone up to look for him. Too bad my husband isn't here. What's wrong? Can you move aside? Hey! Stop it! Are you crazy? Call off your dog! Call it off! You killed her. You're nuts! I didn't kill her! It was an accident! I didn't kill anybody! Hello. Hello. Oh, no. I know. You aren't really hungry, are you?
