20 black. This is the worst run of luck I've had in years. You should try my system. 23 red. You won again, commissioner. Well, what's the meaning of this? You been taking pictures? What? Where's you ever get such a silly idea? You got a camera in that bag. Don't be ridiculous. Come on. Hand it over and be a nice girl. I haven't got a camera. Now what's the big idea? Why, I'm going to speak to the manager. Well, all right. But you wait right here. Why didn't you take it away from her? Well, I wasn't sure. Anyway, she's right in there. Oh, pardon me. Have a good night Miss? Oh, fair, just fair. Will you let me out, please? Those pictures can close us up tighter than a drum. Well, we'll just have to wait and see what... Hey, there she is. Stop her. Open the door. Don't let her get away. Call the gate. Tell them to shut it. Don't let anyone out. Yes, sir. What are you doing in my garage? Just let me sit here a minute. I'll think of an answer. "Flick", the magazine that's there when it happens. Huh? It happened and we weren't there. Well, if we weren't there, it didn't happen. Pat, these are great. Right in the groove. And you said it couldn't be done. I only said not to try it because it was too dangerous. Well, it was. The commissioner with his cutie pie. A gambling house wide open. Wait until Turlock sees these. Old Muscle Bustle will do a nip up. I hope so. Get me a make up page. OK. Oh, good morning, Mr. Turlock. Yes, it's always a good morning if you're healthy. Have a carrot. Hm, hm. King-size today. Oh, Mr. Turlock... The signal. the Boss. Matches, cigarettes, ashtray. You know, I'm getting tired of this physical culture routine. Don't be silly. You know Old Muscle Bustle insists we follow his courses. Come on now, give it a deep breathing. One, two. One... Good morning, Burke, Miss Marvin. Good morning, Mr. Turlock. Turlock Breathing Method. That's good. Very good. One. Two. How's your shape, Marvin? Good shape? Burke? I've decided to do something about "Flick." Yes, of all the magazines I publish, "Flick" is the only one losing money. Mr. Turlock, if you don't... Keep breathing. I will, Mr. Turlock. But first, I want to show you what we've got. A complete layout on the Drexel Club, a gambling joint they denied existed. Why, we've even got a shot of the commissioner playing roulette. That's exactly what I was getting at. Chief gangsters, drunks, gambling joints, burlesque shows. You're always trying to fill "Flick" with lurid things like that. And you're never letting me run them. I you did, maybe the magazine would make money. I can't afford to have my name associated with a magazine like that. GB Turlock, who made America conscious of the fine, clean, strenuous way of life. No, I'm getting rid of "Flick." Getting rid of it? Yes, I've already are found a buyer for the physical assets. Well, that's great. I work for five years to build you a magazine, get you a scoop that will boost our circulation sky high. And what you do? You don't want it. You throw it away, just like that. Believe me, Burke, if it were making money... What about the staff? Well, I've already jobs for some of them. How much have you been offered? $26,000. I'll give you $27,000. Larry, you haven't... How about it, Mr. Turlock? Well, I promised these other people an answer by tomorrow night. If you bring me a check for $27,000 before that time, the magazine's yours. It's a deal. Well, good morning, Burke. Miss Marvin. Here. Have a carrot. Oh, Larry, how you going to get all that money by tomorrow? Don't you worry, I'll get it. There's one thing I'm glad of. What's that? I won't have to breathe anymore. Come in. Come in, Henry. Sorry I'm late, I was working on the books. You know what this is about, don't you, Henry? Miss Marvin told me about all of us taking over the magazine. Isn't it quite a gamble? It's a steal. The way we'll run the magazine will make money right from scratch. And just think. We'll be our own bosses. Bet your life. A cooperative enterprise. And no deep knee bending, either. Yeah, but, $27,000. Who's got that kind of cabbage? Well, I've got $13,000 of my own. And I bet every friend I have. I've got $18,500 in all. Now you ought to be able to subscribe the rest between you. I'll give $25. Good. Gene, $25. You can put me down for $600, then I'm clean. I'll have some trouble with the wife, but put me down for $1,500. Good. Joe, $1,500. $650 for me. I was going to buy myself a new beaver coat, but I'll make the rabbit last awhile. How about you, Frank? No, I'm overdrawn now. Well, we're still a long way from home. Can I get in on this, Mr. Burke? Why certainly, Freddy. It's all for one and one for all. Every little bit helps. Yes, sir. I'll put in three. 1 Freddy, $3. No, sir, $3,000. $3,000? Yes, sir. My aunt left it to me. Freddy, boy, come over. We'll make you our first vice president. Anybody else? I've got $57.13 in the bank. You can have that. $57.13. Well, we still need $2,692.87. Couldn't you borrow it from someone? By tomorrow? I've used up every friend I have. If I got you the difference so that you could close the deal with Mr. Turlock tomorrow, could you pay it back by next month? You mean the $2,692? Well, sure thing. Could you advance it, Henry? I'd have to have it back by next month. Definitely. I'll give you check in the morning. Great, Henry, great. Now all of you have your money on the desk by 10 o'clock in the morning. I'll give Turlock my personal check, and we'll all be in business. Three, four. One, two, three, four. Hello, Mr. Turlock. Oh, hello, Burke. I'm glad to see you. There you are. I was just wishing for someone to come, toss the medicine ball. I didn't come here to play medicine ball. Good shot, my boy. Come on, now, get them over here. What I was trying to say is, have you closed the deal for the magazine yet. No, not yet. Tonight. Watch it. I'm taking you up on your offer. You are? Well, I'm surprised. $27,000. Well, here's a check. The check. Hmm. I didn't think you were serious. I'll pick up the contracts later. Sorry. Tell them I want a lively prospect to set out on our new policy. Larry, they're beautiful. You like them? Oh, I love them, but you shouldn't have. We can't afford this. What do you mean? We're in the dough now. Oh, uh, that'll be all Smitty. If the happiness bugs get any thicker around here, I'm going to take a shot of penicillin. Smitty, always pouring vinegar. Come here, I want to show you something. Now here's a dummy of our first issue. Not only your gambling house shots, but I've arranged for something that will have every picture magazine drooling. Oh, what's that? Tell me, what girl's got the most dough, the best clothes, the most interesting heirlooms, and the bluest blood, and yet has never been photographed? Um, oh! Cynthia Van Loan. You're getting a layout of Cynthia Van Loan? In the bag. Every magazine in the country has tried. And failed. We're getting full and exclusive coverage on her arrival from the coast. How you doing it? Oh, the Burke ingenuity. Joe will be here any minute with the pictures. He takes the models down to the beach... Mr. Burke. Mr. Burke, something just happened. Well, just a minute, Henry. Go ahead, Pat, what's the stuff? Well, there's this new bandana bathing suit. Mr. Burke, I've just got to tell you. The auditors, Darsteen, Stevens and Feckman, are coming to look over the books. Fine. I hope they enjoy them. Go ahead, Pat. Well, we could sure remember ways that a girl with just two bandanas could... Henry, what's the matter? You're shaking. The auditors are coming Tuesday to close the books for Mr. Turlock. I figured they wouldn't be here at least until the first of the month. Then we'd have plenty of time to put the money back. Money back? What money back? I wouldn't have taken it at all, but you said you could give it back by the first of the month. Oh, now just a minute, Henry. Calm down. Give it to me straight. That check I gave you. $2,692.87... Yes? That was Mr. Turlock's money. I took it out of the "Flick" cash account. Holy cow. You needed it to close the deal and I figured we could put it back before they came to look at the books next month. But they're coming Tuesday. You've got to give it back. But I can't give it back. I gave my personal check to Turlock. Couldn't we explain to him? Old Muscle Bustle? He's a pretty good egg, but if there's one thing he won't stand for it's finagling of any kind. Oh, we're sunk. He'll take back the magazine. Well, what about me, Mr. Burke? This is embezzlement. I have a wife and two small children. Oh, Henry, we've got to keep you out of jail. I've been keeping books for Mr. Turlock for 12 years. I never took a penny. I never even left out a decimal point. I don't want to end up in the penitentiary. Wait a minute. I've got it. Get me Jack Withers at News Views. Don't you worry, Henry, I'll fix it. What are you going to do? It breaks my heart, but I have to do it. Hello, Jack? This is Larry Burke. Say, how would you like the most terrific layout of pictures on the Drexel gambling club? Yeah? We sneaked a camera in. Let me get this straight. You want to sell me a layout of the Drexel club for $2,692.87? You must be in trouble. Sorry, Larry. Sorry. I got more crime features than I can handle. Now if you had something that would fit the society section, something outstanding, I mean. Are you lucky. I was holding out, but I just happened need the cash. How would you like a complete layout on Cynthia Van Loan, the heiress who had never been photographed. Wait a minute, Larry. Nobody's ever been able to... you have? You bet your life. You bring the pictures to me and you'll get the dough. Right. OK, Henry, we're in. Bring on your auditors. I'll have the cash for you this afternoon. Oh, but we don't really need it until Tuesday. I'll have it for you today. Is that Wither's guy lucky. Why, that Van Loan dame is... There's Joe now. Welcome home, Joe. It worked, huh? You've got the pictures? You and your ideas. You... you mean you didn't? He didn't. I got everything else, including a punch in the nose. A Burke ingenuity. What kind of photographer are you? Here I get you on the same train with her. Buy you all kinds of disguises. The only time I got close to her was in this outfit. I had the camera strapped to my chest with just the lens sticking out. Like a wart. Yeah. Like a wart. I don't know how those bodyguards spotted it, but they sure did. We'll sue them. They can't go around smashing our warts, I mean, our cameras like this. They paid for it. They keep a special fund just for busted cameras. Well, it was a good idea anyway. I'm sorry I let you down, Larry. Oh, that's all right, Joe. Now you haven't any pictures to sell to News Views. Why didn't you tell me about that dough, Henry. I wouldn't have taken it. I have a life insurance policy. Course, I can't borrow anything on it, but my family is the beneficiary. Now wait just a minute, Henry, don't even think of anything like that. Now go on out and get yourself a nice cup of coffee. Oh, I never drink coffee. It's too stimulating. That take an aspirin. All right. And take one for me. Yes, sir. Van Loan plans to celebrate her 20th birthday... Larry! At the house party of the Van Loan estate, which has been closed since the death of her parents five years ago. It is rumored that during the birthday celebration, Cynthia will announce her engagement to Carl Pauling, well-known broker and man about town. Hey! Hey, look out. Larry, why don't we crash that party and get a layout? "Flick" goes to the Van Loans. Well, that would be great. To get the pictures for Jack Withers, get the dough, clear Henry and everything will be jake. Except that it can't be done. Why not? Why, they'll have that joint surrounded like Betty Hutton at an Elk's convention. We couldn't even get on the grounds, much less in the house. I guess you're right. I wonder how they get enough servants nowadays to run a mausoleum like that. Servants. That's us. Pat, darling, I love you. Hey! Dead or alive? My dear Cynthia, much as I regret parting with Lawrence and Patricia, it is impossible to take them with me to South America. They are perfect jewels. You'll undoubtedly will want first chance at them. Iris Countess Canistool. Very satisfactory. Very satisfactory to me. And, ah, how is the countless? Oh, in the pink. You understand. You are on probation purely. We have very high standards here. Why, I'm sure you do, Mr... Plumley. Ah, Mr. Plumley. Yes. Well, then it's a deal, right? Plumley is the name. I will show you to your rooms. You better not have any, John. But I dessert. That's got nothing to do with it. I see your husband's more obedient than mine. I remember our marriage vows, Delores. You were the one who said something about obeying. Cynthia, I hear you had some trouble at the with photographers. Oh, there was one who was very insistent. But Carl took care of the situation. Yes, I had to smash his camera and rough him up a bit. That will be all. I bet he was all of 5' 2". Sandy. Oh, I don't mind, darling. Sandy is such an old friend of yours. Oh, that's mighty white of you, old boy. Sandy, stop it. Carl behaved perfectly about the photographer. Excuse me. I just sort of lost my appetite. I'm sorry, Carl. He's a bit jealous, dear, and I can't say that I blame him. Sandy and I are like brother and sister. I never saw a brother so upset about his sister becoming engaged. Don't be that way, Amanda. Cynthia, why are you so set against having your picture in the papers? As Cynthia's guardian, I've tried to carry out her parents' wishes. They wanted her kept out of the public eye, allowed to grow up like any normal girl. Like any normal girl with $50 million. I bet the picture magazines would love to get some photographs of this party. Well, don't worry about that. With all the guards we've employed, they can't get near the place. I've been looking for you, Sandy. I know, Cynthia, I know. I acted like a bobby soxer. Well, at least you might have worn a dinner jacket. Oh. Well, you're certainly not trying to hard to be charming. What did you expect me to do, bust out laughing because my girl's going to marry somebody else? We were a couple of kids and that was over ages ago. It isn't over if you'd only shake yourself and wake up. Sandy, if you'd stop being so contrary and try to get to know Carl, maybe... I can wait. Cynthia? Are you really going through with this, Carl? If you mean, am I going through with the marriage? Yes. It's a pity. We understand each other so well. Shall we have a drink to our understanding? Excuse me. Ah, waiter. Sorry, these are reserved. Shall we take a little walk? All right. Keep moving, keep moving. You're so slow. Oh! Who was that? Mr. Riley. Miss Van Loan's accountant. He takes care of her books and fixed them and all that sort of thing. He's very clever with a pencil. You're so right. What was that? Who did that? Come back here. Stop, I say. Stop. Pauling, you're a bigger fool than I thought you were. If that picture's printed, it will ruin everything. How could I know there's be a photographer around? You didn't have to know. With the wedding only a couple weeks away, you're could have kept your hands off of other women. Don't take that tone with me, Matthews. Easy, easy. Just take it easy. Arguing isn't going to help. Now you have no idea who took that picture? No, except he was from "Flick Magazine." Well, then there's only one thing to do. Keep "Flick" from printing it. That's all. Riley, you have the mind of a bookkeeper. Stop jiggling them so I can see. Wait a minute, I'm looking for that last one I shot. The clench. Aha! Here it is. It's a good thing I got that film out of the camera before I lost it. Heiress's fiance pitching woo. Oh, I wish I could keep that shot to "Flick." There's only one thing wrong with this shot. What's that? The wrong guy. That guy Pauling's a horse's neck. Ah, you're prejudiced. She should latch on to that Sandy kid. Are you lonely, hmm? Just write to Beatrice Bare Facts Burke. Advice to the lovelorn. Go ahead and laugh, but I know true love when I see it. Look, chum. Before you have me in tears, do you want me to make more prints of those? Yeah, the usual. I'll take these over to Withers and get the check right away. Boy, this is hot copy. What's the gimmick? Why do you want to sell them to me? Look, bub. Don't look at gift horse in the mouth. How about the, um... Oh, that. Yeah. $2,692.87, right? To the penny. Well, I have to get the boss to sign the check. Can you stop around about 8 o'clock? Don't worry, we'll be here. Oh, um, don't forget. Make that check out to me, uh. OK. See you later. Now, ah, look here young lady. I told you before. I want to see the editor. And don't tell me that he's out again. All right, I won't. But he's out. If you want to sit down and wait... Oh, Mr. Burke, this gentleman insists on seeing you. Oh, yes, I'll be with you in just a minute. If you'll just give me five minutes. In a minute, in a minute. That was a narrow squeeze. Yes, Mr. Burke. Ask that man out there what he wants. Tell him I'm very busy. He wouldn't tell me what he wants. I'm Carl Pauling, Cynthia Van Loan's fiance. Congratulations. Of all the nerve. I found one of "Flick's" cameras outside my fiance's house last night. And you want to return it. You're an honest man. I want to talk to you about the pictures that man took. Sorry, we never let subjects OK pictures. I don't want to OK them, I want those pictures. Certainly. We'll send you a print right after they're printed. This is ridiculous. Will you let me come in there and talk to you? Now look, mister. We know Miss Van Loan doesn't like publicity. But after the public sees that one of you and her kissing, they're realize she's a human being in spite of all her dough. Look, how much will you take for that picture? I don't get it. I've already explained to you. Well, wait a minute. Maybe I do get it. Sure. Why else would you be so panicky. Are you going to sell me that negative or aren't you? You were kissing the wrong girl, weren't you? And your fiancee will find it out when she sees the picture. Hm, a wolf yet. Will you let me in there so I can talk to you? I've already told you, I haven't got them. I sold them to News Views. Sold them. Yes, now will you get out of my office before I come out there and throw you out? That's telling him. Are you sure the door is locked? You know it is. Thank you. Hey, this is driving me daffy. I still can't tell who that girl is that he's kissing. Do you remember who was wearing a dress like that with a cabbage flower down at the bottom? Cynthia should know. Oh, but if Jack prints that picture, it'll break her heart. Better she finds out about that heel now than after they're married. My stomach's starting to hate you. OK, we'll pick up to check, and we'll put on the feedbag. We'll pick up the check and give it to Henry first. I don't want anything else to happen. Thank you. Jack, it's Larry. Well, he's not in. He said to meet him here at 8 o'clock. He probably went out to dinner. Mind as well wait inside. Oh! Larry! What's the matter? Oh, look. He's been shot. It's murder. What's that? Part of the envelope that those pictures were in. The pictures. They're gone. No check, either. I got Jack into this. How? It wasn't your fault. Somebody killed him to keep those pictures from seeing daylight. The heel? Why not? He wants to marry the Van Loan girl badly. Didn't even stop at murder. Well, you're jumping to conclusions. It's open and shut. I think we better call the police. They'll get him soon enough. And if Carl Pauling did this, I want to be the one that traps him. Let's get out of here before we're trapped. I still think you should have called the police. And have every rag in town share our scoop? Nothing doing. But if he really is the killer, going back there now is just like walking down Danger Street. I still have to get some more evidence on him. And this is the only way I know how to do it. You're so positive it was Pauling. Yes, I am. Especially since I talked to Bob Thomas on the Wall Street Journal. Why? What did he say? Pauling's as flat as a pancake, but still keeping up a front. He'd do anything to marry that bundle of dough. Could have been the husband of the woman he was kissing, to keep from having that picture printed. Or the woman herself. We ought to find out who she was. It might help. Yeah. Oh. What's that matter? Maybe Mr. Plumley won't take us back. Well, he's got to. Having that mutt along isn't going to help any, though. She is not a mutt. You know very well servants aren't allowed to keep dogs. Well, I wasn't going to let her stay in my apartment alone all night. How are you going to get her in your room? Well, I'll take the car down to the garage while you talk to Mr. Plumley. And then I'll sneak her into the room. All right. But if Plumley catches you, he's going to throw us all out. What? You can say that again. I think your leaving without permission is like a soldier deserting his post... inexcusable. Especially when you knew Miss Van Loan was having house guests. You're absolutely right, Mr. Plumley. But, well, you see, I had to take my wife to a doctor. A doctor? What for? Really? Really! Congratulations, Lawrence. Oh, I say, that is splendid. Oh, I'm so happy. That's splendid! Oh, Mrs. Burke. Yes, Mr. Plumley? Lawrence has just told me. And you made me very, very happy. Happy? Yes. You must have a good night's rest and I'll see that you have light duty. That's most generous of you, Plumley. Not at all, not at all. You must be very happy. Happy? Oh, yes! Ah, deliriously. Well, I think I'll take a little walk. Lawrence, my boy. She needs you. Well, now what gives with this happy routine? I just told him you were expecting a little visitor. Oh. You what? Shh. Don't get excited. It was the only way I could get us back in here. Great. Well, here we are. Yes, here we are. The only thing is, you've got to find yourself another place to sleep. It's going to look awfully funny to Mr. Plumley. Oh, no it isn't. Not if you tell him that you have a cold and you have to have a room of your own. A cold? Um-hum. You think of everything, don't you? Um-hum. Well, Ha-choo. Good night. Now what? Larry, I'm afraid you'll have to take her out. Suppose somebody sees me? It's after 12 o'clock. Everyone's asleep. Well, I hope so. I'd feel awfully silly getting caught with this dog. Who's there? Larry! Oh, Larry, what happened? Whose dog is that? Who's out there? Come on. Whoever it was that conked me is onto us. They got my set of contact prints on those pictures. Was it Carl? How should I know? I've got a bump head as big as a goose egg. Um-hum. I told you you should have called in the police. Now don't start that again. I'll get that guy... If it's the last thing you do. And it looks as if that's exactly what it'll be. Hey. What are you chewing on? She must have torn this out of the guy's coat. And you didn't want me to bring her along. Ah, good baby. Tomorrow I start matching this up with every coat in this house. Who is it? It's Lawrence, sir. I've been assigned as your valet. Oh, ah, come in. You can put out my riding clothes, the tan gabardine breeches. Yes, sir. And see that my boots are polished. Saddle soap them first. Yes, sir. Haven't I seen you before? It's quite possible, sir, I've been here for several days. Not you face, your voice. Sounds familiar. Oh, I remember. Were you ever with the Cunninghams? Oh, yes, sir. Several years ago. That's it then, I knew I'd place it. I never forget a voice. Oh, I'll get that. Yes? Oh, yes darling. At the lodge? All right. I'll drive down and meet you there in about ten minutes. Where's your camera? What's up? You know the mystery dame in that clinch? Yeah, I've been looking for that dress of hers. The heel just made a date with her and I'm going to get me some pictures. Really? Where? Out at some lodge. Jake said it's down at the end of the estate. Oh, Larry, be careful. He may be the murderer, but I don't think he's the one that's on to us. Why not? He isn't acting to cagey with me. But it may be some sort of trick to get you into a spot. Pooh. And kill you. Pooh. Pooh? Ah. Cozy. [INAUDIBLE] and double again. What luck. Hear up. Unlucky in cards, lucky in love. I wonder. You're awfully serious today, Johnson. What's the matter, stock market down? No, just one of those days. Deal, Amanda. Maybe my luck will change. Oh, yeah. I'll be vulnerable as heck on there. You're vulnerable. You don't have to beat our heads off because we're vulnerable. You did have a nice hand, though. You better go in first. I'll be along shortly. Yes, you would be much better that way. What do you mean by that? What do you think I mean? Carl was nice enough to drive me down to the village. Uh-huh. I've had just about enough of you. Afraid I'll tell Cynthia? Now look here, Sandy, let's settle... Get away from me. Carl! Sandy! Stop it! I say, they're... they're fighting out there. Can't you do something? Do something? Yes, I'll notify Miss Cynthia. Here, here. What's going on here? I'm sorry, Cynthia. I shouldn't have fought with him here. We can continue it somewhere else. Take it easy, Sandy. What started this? Ask him. He always had such beautiful answers. You know he's jealous, Cynthia. He's been trying to pick a fight ever since he got here. Sandy, have you no regard for my feelings? None whatever. After this, I suppose won't want to stay for the wedding. I don't think so. Oh, I hate to break up with him like this. Who is it? It's Larry. Oh, come on in. Jake just told me that Sandy and Carl... Yeah, I know. What are you so upset about? I've been pinched by two guests and Mr. Plumley. And we're not getting anywhere. Oh, I've looked for that dress and match that piece of cloth with every garment in the house. We can't quit now. I've got a real plan working. What plan? I've stashed a camera down at the heel's hideaway. It's rigged so it'll take pictures of anyone who comes in or whatever happens. So what. I've got pictures, if you want a layout for "Flick." No, I'm going to get some more clicks with Carl and that dame. Then I'll tell them... Carl or whoever it is... that I've got them. If it was important enough before to commit murder, they'll come after those pictures again. You're going to make a decoy duck out of yourself? He'll come after me and I'll be all set. Well, I'm not going to let you stick your neck out. Rather let Henry go to jail? If we can capture a murderer, "Flick" ought to be able to borrow money on that scoop alone. Well, you're the boss. They've released a story on Jack Withers. Hello. Oh, oh, yes, yes sir. Yes, sir. I'll be right down. It's Mr. Plumley. He wants to see us. Come on. I don't care what you say, you can't fire us without notice. Who pinned this rap on me? I understand Mr. Pauling had the perception to realize you're incompetent. Oh, he did, did he? Quite. Here are your wages to date. I'm very sorry for your sake, and the little one. If you should ever decide to leave your husband, we'll be very happy to have you back. Well, that should make you very happy. You wanted to quit. Well, at least I got enough pictures for a layout. It's not a total loss, Larry. Larry. Larry! The films. They're gone. Every single roll. Every shot we had. So that's why he had me fired. You mean, the heel? Who else? He finally tumbled to us. Oh, we're right back where we started. No pictures, no murderer, no nothing. Start packing. I'll be right back. Where you going? Never mind. Just wait. Now Larry, don't do anything foolish. "Guests playing bridge." "Cynthia's gowns." "The heel and the heiress." Having fun? Yes, very much. Handy little place. Good for a lot of things. Burning film. Cozy little meetings. I find your small talk as offensive as your pictures. I didn't come here to talk. I've been punched once today and I'm not in the mood for another fight. Now get out. Thought you could handle me as easily as Jack Withers, huh. Withers? Maybe I haven't any real evidence yet, but you can't get away with it very long. Oh, by the way. I brought your press notices. Operator. What am I going to tell the staff? Just like a woman. The world's cracking up and she powders her nose. I'm trying to think. Will you let me off at the next corner, please? What for? Well, I just thought of something I have to do. Oh, you want me to go up there and break the bad news all by myself, huh? It isn't that at all. Sometimes a girl has things she has to do. If you were in trouble, I'd be with you til the last ditch. Oh, rats. If I had known it was going like this... Will we lose the magazine? Probably. I'll try to pay you all back somehow. But Mr. Burke... You're not going to take the rap for that money, Henry. I am. But Mr. Burke... I've sent for Mr. Turlock. I ought to make a clean breast of the whole thing and throw myself on his mercy. There his is. Let him in, will you, Joe? Well, well, well. Must be pretty important to call me out of the gym. Well, you see, JB, there's been a little difficulty. Oh, trouble already. Well, no, not exactly that. What I wanted to tell you was about that check. Went through the bank this morning. Oh, it did. Well, that cash was there, but $2,692 of it was... Larry! Oh, Larry. I was just down at police headquarters and... Yes, I know, Pat. I know. You were trying to help me. But it isn't up to the police yet. It's up to Mr. Turlock. I was just trying to explain to him... What are you talking about? Yes, what are you talking about? The check. I was just trying... Oh, that! Well, never mind that now. Well, what about that check? Well, you see... Larry, the Uy-G, the same one that got Ack-J... Uy-G, Ack-J? Look, Pat, I'm in enough trouble now without... Ah, Larry, um... Mr. Turlock, would you please excuse us? We'll only be a minute, honestly. Yeah, we'll only be a minute. Now what's all the devil talk? I took Carl's gun down to Lieutenant Hite of ballistics. Yeah. He checked it. It's the same gun that shot Withers. Then we've got Carl hooked. But you let the police in on it. Oh, no I didn't. Hite wanted to know where I got the gun, but I wouldn't tell him. I made a deal with him. He's going to keep quiet for 24 hours, we turn the killer over and he gets all the credit. Pat, that's great. I love you. Now let's get back out there and zip this thing up, huh. Hey, wait a minute. What about Turlock? We get a scoop like that, we can still raise the dough. Yeah. Say, how'd you get back in here? The guard at the back gate didn't know we'd been sacked, Jake. Have you see Carl Pauling around? Well, he was down hear the lodge a little while ago. I think I'll go down and fix him for good. Don't you think maybe you ought to have some help, Larry? Worried? You go see Cynthia and get a lot of pictures, huh? Lots of pictures. OK. Patricia. What are you doing here? Oh, ah, I forgot some of my things. Oh, no, Patricia. Mr. Pauling told us about your husband. Newspaper people, eh? Now what's he doing? What's he up to? Well, he didn't come back with me. Patricia, we know your husband's here and he's up to no good. Now where your husband? Well, he went down to the lodge, Mr. Plumley, just now. The lodge, eh? I'll fix that young fellow. I'll get him off the premises. You watch her. Well, I don't mind. I want to talk to you. Me? I mean, ah, I, sir? Yes. And whom have I the honor of addressing? I'm Boward, chief of police of this township. And it's no honor. Police? Yeah. Where do we find... what's his name? Pauling. Carl Pauling. Yeah, that's right. He put in a call for us. Said it was important. He's down at the lodge. I was just going down there. Come on and show us the way. Very well. Lawrence! What have you done? Huh? He called me just before you got here. Why? I don't know. Because you'd been threatening him, that's why. That's ridiculous. Is it? Where'd you get this gun? I've told you, it isn't mine. I didn't shoot him. Then suppose you tell me who did. Anybody here could have done it. It's outrageous. Are you going to arrest him or you going to argue all night? Look, I'm chief of police of this township. Now, who are you? I'm Miss Van Loan's guardian. All right, then guardian her. But shut up. You're not at a board of directors meeting, dear. And stop doodling, Riley. You make me nervous. You went down there to get him. We have witnesses. I just said he said, I'll fix it. Sure. I was sore at him. I even took a poke at him, but that doesn't mean I killed him. A lot of people here had it in for him. Well, I didn't. I didn't have nothing in for nobody. Why did you have it in for him? I figured he killed my friend to get some pictures I took. Hm. Must have been some pictures. They were. They showed him in a clinch with a dame and it wasn't Miss Van Loan. Who was she? You couldn't see her face. Maybe her husband killed Carl out of jealous. As a lawyer, I can tell you that won't stand up in court. You'll have to do better than that. Well, it could be true. I saw the pictures. Maybe that's so, and maybe you used that picture to blackmail him. Oh, that's absurd. Why do you twist everything against Larry? Why don't you ask the others where they were when the shooting happened? Don't you tell me how to run my business. Where were you when the shooting happened? Here's the other one, chief. Sandy. I'm terribly sorry about Carl. This is all so horrifying. Hey, chief. Where was he when Carl was killed? I'll ask the questions, young lady. Where were you when Carl was killed? You don't think that I... I was at home. I left here hours ago. I didn't know anything about it until they came for me. You live down the bay, don't you? Yes. Then you must have gone by boat. You left from the boathouse. That's close to the lodge. Well, I did pass the lodge on the way down, but I didn't stop there. I just waited at the boathouse for my boat. Huh. Nobody saw you leave. You can check with my boatman. Don't tell me what to do. I'll check with your boatman. We'll find out what time you left the boathouse all right. In the meantime, the rest of us have to sit around here like a lot of prisoners? I'm hungry. I have work to do. The rest of you can do as you please, as long as you stay on the grounds. But you, and you we're holding. Larry, they've really got you in the middle. Don't remind me. I came down here to catch a murderer and I end up with a murder rap. In 21 years of service, nothing like this has ever happened in my household before. Get me some more coffee. I won't be able to sleep anyway. Veronica, Veronica, where are you? Where's Veronica, do you know? How should I know? I didn't do no killing and you can't keep me here. I got a date. Nobody leaves the grounds and that means you, too. Well, that's all right for them without dates. But if I don't go out with my man, he'll go out with somebody else. Tough luck. Get yourself a man you can trust. Ain't no such thing. Oh, Veronica. May I see you alone, please? Where did you get that dress? Oh, you like it? Oh, it's lovely. But where did you get it? I see. 4 o'clock. Yes, Sullivan, it checks OK. Round up the boys. I got our man. You're in the clear, Evans. He wasn't killed for at least an hour after you got home. Good. Come on, Burke. I'm taking you down and booking you. OK. Larry! Oh, Larry, I found it. What? You know, what we've been looking for. Well, I found it. The cook was wearing it. The cook? Veronica? Yes. You don't mean Carl was... Oh, no. It was given to her. Well, what good's it going to do us now? Plenty. I've got a hunch. Come on. Let's not waste anymore time. Chief, maybe I can clear this whole thing up right here tonight. Just give me 30 minutes. What have you got up your sleeve? You can spare 30 minutes, can't you, to keep from making a bad mistake? He'll have plenty of time after he's booked. Ah, look, Pat, let's not try to help me out any more. I'm in enough trouble as it is. But chief, think of all the publicity. Why, we'll run a special edition on this case giving you all the credit. Please, a half an hour? Our pictures in "Flick" magazine, huh. Why sure. Pages and pages of them. I'll even make you the Cop of the Week. What do you say? Hmm. I don't know why I should. But I will. Good. Give me 30 minutes and then bring everybody down to the lodge. OK, young lady, but watch yourself. Yeah, watch yourself. This is going to tell us who the murderer really is. Larry fixed an automatic trip to take a picture every time someone came through that door. When the film in this is developed, we'll know who did it. Who the last person was to come through that door after Carl. Is this on the level? I'm betting Larry's life you'll find someone else's picture on this film. Larry. Did you fix the light for developing? Good. Now the overhead. In few minutes, the negative will be developed. When the emulsion is fixed, we'll see the film and get a nice, candid view of our murderer. Now the first move is to take the film out of the camera. Pat, are you all right? Yeah. Who fired that shot? It came from back there. Like heck it did. I saw the flash over there. Get me out of here. Just a minute. I don't know where it came from. I was watching her. Well, there's the gun. Don't touch that. What are you doing, Pat, you might have been shot. Luckily the murderer had good aim. Well, looks like you'll all go down to headquarters now. Take them down there, Bill. What's the matter? Don't you want to see the pictures? How can we? You don't think I'd be stupid enough to risk the real film. Here's the one that's going to pay off for us, safe and sound. Shall we try it again? Pat, are you sure you know what you're doing? The light, please. Larry, maybe you better stand over there and see that no one turns it on until I'm ready. After that shot, we're sure the murderer is right here in this room. First you'll see a picture of Carl. Then you'll see a picture of a person that came in after him. The person who shot him. There now, just a few more seconds. This is intolerable. I won't... Shut up. What's the matter, your nerves getting a little edgy? Let's see what we have here. Ah, yes. There's Carl and here's... Stop it. Charles! Yes, it's my picture they've got. Why I never thought he... You can book him for two murders, chief. Two? Yeah. Pauling and Jack Withers, editor of News Views. You were afraid Withers would plant that picture of Carl and the dame, so he went there and tried to buy it. Withers wouldn't sell it, so you kill him to get it. When I accused Carl of the murder this afternoon, he didn't know anything about it. I thought he was faking. He knew you'd gotten the pictures back, but he didn't know how. When he read here of Withers murder, he got scared and called Chief Boward. You found out and killed him to shut him up. Why would he kill the magazine editor? Why, well, well, because of... Guess I got the killer. Just came up [INAUDIBLE] and headed for the bushes. We've got a killer here. No, this guy was escaping. He's the killer, all right. But he's the murderer. Then he must be an accomplice. I had nothing to do with the murders. I just kept the books straight. And when, when Matthews took Miss Van Loans money, I... I covered up for it. But I had nothing to do with the killing. Sure. That's it. There's your motive, chief. Matthews is Cynthia's guardian. He steals her dough and promotes Carl into a marriage with her so he can get his hooks into her estate. Leaving himself in the clear. Nothing to it. Take him away. Don't tell me what to do. Take him away. Sandy. Will you ever forgive me? After we've been married about 15 years, I'll give it some thought. Well, Pat, you certainly put it over. Thanks. Let me see that. Hey. There's nothing on this. I know. You're little gadget didn't work. It was the first thing I checked. But... but how? When Veronica told me that she got that dress from Mrs. Johnson, I figured we had just one chance. I'd trap Mr. Johnson into giving himself away as the jealous murderer. As it turned out, it wasn't Johnson. What do you care? Your bluff worked. Oh, sure. We got the murderer, all right, but we still got embezzlement facing you. Yeah. Well, before I go to jail, I'm going to put out one issue of "Flick" they'll remember. "Flick Magazine," please. May I have a "Flick Magazine?" "Flick Magazine", please. "Flick" please. Come in. Mr. Burke. The auditors, Mr. Darsteen and Mr. Stevens. How do you do? How do you do. Fine day, isn't it. Beautiful. Yes, fine. Are the books ready? Are they? Everything in order, we hope. What should I do? Do? Why, let them see the books, of course. Let them have fun. But, ah... Oh, if there's anything wrong, we'll find it. We always do. I'll be waiting. All right, gentlemen. This way. You couldn't raise it, huh? This murder story's terrific. And this gambling house expose, sensational. You put some life in the magazine. This new policy is going to make you a fortune. Fortune, huh. You really think so? I didn't make $10 million in publishing without knowing a good thing. Hmm. Well, what are you going to do? No use waiting. I'm going to tell Turlock. About the money for the magazine, Mr. Turlock, I wanted to tell you... Oh, that's exactly what I wanted to tell you about the money. You mean, you already know about it? Oh, yes, of course, but you mustn't think just because you had one successful edition, that you can do anything. Well, I wouldn't have done it, only... Now you're going to need money, of course. For expansion, you know. And I'm willing to give it to you. Give it to me, huh? Give it to me? Yes, for a half interest. For half interest? Yeah, what do you say? $20,000? $20,000? Make it $25,000 and we'll listen. $22,500 and not a cent more. It's a deal. Ah, that's wonderful. What about the auditors? Ah, yes, I guess I'd better tell him. Oh, Mr. Turlock, $2,692 of that money I originally gave you for the magazine was yours. Mine? Yes. Henry borrowed it from the "Flick" cash account. Of course, I... I told him to. Hmmm, well. That puts an entirely new light on the matter. But we put the magazine over. What are you going to do? Do? Why, deduct that amount from the $22,500. Of course. Oh, Mr. Turlock, you're a darling. Mr. Turlock, you're wonderful. Hold it.
