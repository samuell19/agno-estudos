In sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life through our Lord Jesus Christ, we commend to Almighty God, our sister Abigail Peller. And we commit her body to the ground; earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust. Amen! Mum wanted you to have all her stuff from the house, the both of you. To be honest it's mostly old books and a load of junk but... I can easily drop it off at the charity shop if you want? We'll pop over and have a look. Well you'd better be quick. Your mother and I start clearing the house on Saturday. Make sure you do the driving Anna ok? Course. Read your thing. I don't know. I might leave it. No go on, just do it. What's this? Um... Hello everyone. I'd like to read a poem in memory of Nana Abigail. Awake to hear the sweet harps play. To love before him on his way. And the night wind answering in antiphon. Till night is overgone. Play on, invisible harps, unto Love. Whose way in heaven is aglow at that hour when soft lights come and go. Soft sweet music in the air above. And in the earth below. That was lovely. It was very sweet, it was very moving. Why don't you go and rest? You're ok. It was just a small one. Just a small one. She'll be fine. She just needs to rest. Well if you're sure? Yeah of course. Yeah, that's really lovely. Listen, I'll just get my coat ok? - Thanks Hun. - Bye Dad Nana would've been really pleased. She's up there right now, looking down on us all with the good lord, laughing. You alright? Let me prop you up a bit. Make you nice and comfy. You need to drink that, It's nice and sweet. I think you should go back to the doctor and get your medication reviewed or at least let them... Well... You know. What happens if I'm not here and you have a fit? And what if I'm staying at Dan's and... Fine, fine I'll go. I'm just upset about Nan. Yeah, I know. I tell you what... Why don't you get dressed and we'll pop round to Nan's before Mum dumps all her stuff? It'll give us a chance to find something sentimental. Looks like Mum's been here already. I know, I wanted to look through everything first. Is that a book of spells? No, I think it's stories. Listen to this. Remedies prescribed for those who by prest-id-ig-i-tory art have lost their virile members. Is prestidi-thingie ye olde English for shagging? I think it's like, magic tricks or something like that. With their virile members? That sounds sexy. They had courted from a young age and life was happy. Then came the Great War, and she would not see him again for many years. On his return, she loved him as she had always done, ...but a changeling had come back in his place. The eager boy had gone, and an angry man returned. Times were hard and his anger worsened. He refused to see his children and she would suffer daily by his hand. She took to walking in the woods at night, ...where she would fall upon her knees and plead to the heavens for an end to the hurt. The heavens remained silent throughout, ...but another voice answered in their stead. An old woman appeared and told her that she too had suffered at the hand of man... ...and that she would take away the husband forever... ...and give the woman back her peace. For a price. Desperate, she accepted. In return, the old woman demanded to be given care of the daughter. Seven days later came a great fire, and it was not just the man who would perish, ...but the woman's sons too. Only her daughter survived. What? Tea? Thanks... I'll have it in the bath. You haven't fallen asleep in there have ya? No. Do you ever feel as though you're... ...slowly fading out of existence? As if... As if we're barely even here any more. Days just... ...drift by. Anna? Yeah, it is what it is. Get some sleep, huh? What? But I wanna come back, I'm fine. How long? Well I wouldn't want to give the company a bad name would I? Well? I'm officially signed off for three months. They don't want me having an episode in front of a client. Christ! Shit! Stop Mr Postman. Wait Mr Postman. Where have you gone Mr Postman? Ahh fuck! Please be open. Hello? Oh hello darling. I just want to make sure you were home because me and your dad were going to pop over. I bought a new nail varnish to cheer myself up after mum. Well, you know. Deep rouge. You'll love it. Anyway, so we'll be over in... Th-th-that's fine. Darling. What's wrong? That's fine... I mean, I'm fine mum. Come over whenever. I'm in all day. This is the color I was telling you about. It's identical to the one that nail lady was using and charging us a fortune for. Nice isn't it? My god. Your nose. Roy... Roy. A tissue! A tissue! To the kitchen. Come on. Mum, calm down. - Mum. - Head back. Come on. Pinch your nose. It's alright. Put your head back. That's it, that's it. That's it. See, it's stopped. Alright? This happened before? What's going on? Oh, come here. I wish you'd talk to me, you know? I can help you. I prayed for you last night, you know? Alright? Thought I'd put another pot on. It's okay love. Hey... Come on... Alright. I'll handle this, thank you Roy. - What? - Go. I think I was about your age when this picture was taken. Where was your house? Oh, not far. Near here. But long gone. It burned down. And then they built the Wishing Tree Estate over the top of it. Is that your mum? My great grandma? No... Linda... She's your grandmother. No. I'm Claire, Grandma. Linda's my mummy? Oh dear. Um. Not to worry my sweet. Just don't make her upset. As long as you don't question her. You mustn't speak about her. She'll think you're being rude. You're not are you? No no no no. Now you go outside and play and I'll speak to her. She's just a child... A silly foolish child. Go Linda. Go now. I'll stay at yours tonight yeah? I'd love that... But? But, Claire really needs me right now. Oh for God's sake. No listen, babe. She's my sister. I can't just turn my back on her now. The seizures are getting more frequent. To be honest, as things are now, I don't see much of a future for her. She's really fragile. Yeah but, what about our future? What about it? I'm not going anywhere are you? Well not for the next half hour or so. Yeah well. I've got about 8 minutes so let's forget the faff. Alright, deal. I gotta go... I need to check on Claire. Alright? Yeah, yeah. Fancy going out later? Yeah. Why not? Help take my mind off things. Dan might pop along too. Um, I was thinking. Go easy on the booze. Fits and all that. Alright. Hey, Brad the lad! Alright Dan? Have you got a bird mate? Yeah I, I've, I've got a... Couple of girls on at the minute. Alright, so no. Wow, hey, you are totally coming out with me tonight. Yeah? Yeah. So, hey, don't let me down. Six thirty, on the PM. Do I need to go home and get changed? Mate, you're good as you are. Chill out. Alright darling. I heard heaven was missing an angel, and here you are. Do you really go in for all that cheesy role play stuff with Dan? I don't know what you're talking about Sis. I can handle Dan The Man, don't you worry. I'm fine. It's just a wobble. Look, Claire. First thing in the morning you are calling the doctor. And if you don't, I'm gonna do it for you. I don't get it. Something's not right. What's changed? It's happening more and more. Don't Anna, not now, It's not me. What do you mean, it's not you? Anna. I'm seeing things... In this house. What things? I don't know. People. An old woman, a child. I don't know. I'm not ill... It's more than that. An old woman and a child? You're just missing Nan and the meds are messing with ya. For Christ's sake, my house isn't haunted. Look Claire, I can deal with the mood swings and the depression and the seizures, but this... I am not joking. I have been face to face with them. They are as clear as you are sitting in front of me now. - Anna. - And, they're in my dreams. In this house, everywhere I go... Look... You need to get your drugs sorted, and find that balance. We're both missing Nan. You've got to be stronger than this hun. We can't look after you forever. Come on. You could do with a night out. You're right. Just the meds, I guess. Sorry Sis. You a big drinker then Claire? Why? Do I look like a big drinker? Dunno. I'm more of a lager man myself. How nice. Last date I had, absolute disaster. The shop was shut for refurbishment, if you know what I mean? Or should've been, anyway. It was like a car crash down there. She didn't seem to mind, though. Hey. You alright? Yeah, I... I want to leave. Now. Dan. Yeah, yeah, I got it. Listen Hun, I've said this so many times now, turn your bedroom light off when you go out. I always turn my light off. What are you talking about? Well, what's that then? I'll call it a night I think. Can I get you something Bradley Bunch? Yeah, I'll have a squash. Jesus! Are you alright? Yeah. I'll um... Give you a call tomorrow alright? See you tomorrow. I'll see you tomorrow won't I? Jesus, Claire, that was a bit cold wasn't it? Excuse me? Well I mean he's a nice guy. Would a goodbye kiss have killed you? Did you hear what he said in the pub? The man is revolting. How dare you fix me up on a blind date with no warning. And with someone who's clearly never been in the presence of a woman apart from his mum. And secondly, is that my league now? Dan the Man. Is that how you've marked my scorecard? You know what? Fuck the pair of you. It was just a dream. Get some sleep. She's adamant the house is haunted. I don't know. What if it's not a medical thing? Yea, I'm not saying that Dan, but... Look, I've gotta go, I'll speak to you later. Dan, can I have a word? Little busy right now, Bradleykins. Last night when we got to your house. Yeah about that... It was wrong to set you up with Claire, mate. Her head's all over the place right now. Just, take no notice yeah? Sorry. Just let me finish Dan. No, look, um... I should explain. She's not... She's not right in head. She reckons she's seeing things, people. - Really? - Yeah. Anna and I thought it would be good to get her out the house for a bit. That's why I thought it would be nice to... you know. Well... What if she is Dan? I mean, this is what I wanted to talk to you about. That house. When we went inside it... Oh god, not you as well. It was in the hallway ok? A child wearing a mask. Maybe I was lagered up but... I've gotta get this. Dan Philips. So... How's the, um, new medication coming along? What's it called? Keppra? Is it having any impact on the... fits? Dunno. How's Anna, love? All this can't be that easy on her. What's that supposed to mean? Sweetheart, she called us. She's worried. She really cares about you and... All this nonsense... And seeing things. I can't believe she called you. What a bitch. Oh come on Claire! She has... We've been discussing it, hmm? We've made a decision. We're going to go private. That's your dad's idea. I still want you to come to the church with me. We have found a really good specialist. He's gonna sort you out ok? It's not your fault my love. Dad! No, no, don't "Dad" me Claire. Actually we have an appraisal later on today and I will be taking you. Father. Hello Claire. Father. Whatever's the matter? Here we are. Careful, it's hot. So tell me, what's troubling you? Everyone thinks I'm going mental. Why would they think that? How would you react... If someone told you they were seeing things? People that aren't there. And are you? Seeing things? Every day. I don't know what to do. Now listen to me. Let's assume for a moment that you are seeing actual spirits. It's very rare for these things to occur all of a sudden. They're usually brought on by people dabbling in the occult. These things open doors. Now... Think very carefully. Could there have been a time where you may have invited evil into your life? No, Father. Didn't start til my nan passed away. The church is always here for you Claire. Here, take these. Read Psalm 91. Whoever dwells in the shelter of the most high, will rest in the shadow of the almighty. Claire! I'd better go. Remember... God is greater than any evil. Sorry, I got talking to Father. Claire, what you are experiencing... it is a medical issue. Darling, I really want to help, I am trying to be patient, but if you let these God botherers start feeding you their nonsense we are only going to end up right back at the beginning. Obviously don't tell your Mother I said that. You're having hallucinations for Christ's sake. Yeah, that's what they are. Hmm? What? I said yes, Dad. Well it's a pleasure to meet both of you together, but I just wonder, Roy, would it be possible for Claire and I just to have a one-to-one just on our own? Just for a few minutes. Would that be ok? - Yes of course. - Great. Just explain everything that's been going on. What you've been experiencing. And what you told Anna, and of course the fits. I'll be just outside. Thank you. So Claire, just to make it clear, this is in no way a session or anything like that. It's just a preliminary chat. Because it was your dad that first contacted the clinic and it was your dad that said you were seeing things. I just wanted to hear, in your own words, um... What's been happening? My mother and my father, hold quite strong views. Life's been difficult. But actually I feel far better today after speaking to a priest. Hmm... So you understand that you are on a new cocktail of drugs to try and deal with it all, the seizures you've been having? And that they're working? I've been through all of your GP's notes and... I fully support all of the medications that you've been prescribed. But it just appears that you're suffering from some unforeseen reactions. So that's what this is, is it? A reaction issue? Maybe. That would be convenient for us to assume that, but I think... I think we might be being naive. You know, in my experience, seeing things often comes from a more deep-rooted problem. Tell me, did your priest recommend that you not see a medical professional? He believed me. Claire, I'm absolutely sure that when you're experiencing these things they feel very real. No doubt. But, I'd like to get you into an MRI scan. Because I think that if you can accept that these things aren't real, you can make that jump. Then it's gonna make your treatment a whole lot easier. Understand? You need to accept that you need medical help. Okay? Are you gonna be alright kid? I'll be fine Dad. Alright? Yeah, come and have a sit down, I wanna talk to you. I spoke to mum & dad. I know. Why would you do that? We thought it was only right to let them know the situation. We? So Dan has joined the official committee of matters pertaining to Claire has he? Do you know just how much shit will occur now you've dragged them in? I've now got mum and the rest of the god squad preaching to me. Dad just thinks I'm mental and needs dosing up. It will be fine Hun. Well it wasn't. It was horrendous. Me and Dan both believe you're experiencing something. What did the doctor say? The doctor said there's a medical answer to all this. Father O'Shea wants to know if I could've let the devil into my life unknowingly. I got... these. And a cup of tea. I sat on them in the car so Dad didn't see. I don't know whether to laugh or cry. Why don't you ask Mum and Dad, see what they'd do. Oh hang on a minute. Shut up! You know you're Mum's fave. At least you work properly. Yeah, Claire, this isn't you talking. It's the illness. No, this is definitely me. Ok fine. I'm gonna head out to see Dan. Great. Whatever. Enjoy your evening of rapey sex talk followed by a sixty second shag. Sorry I'm late. That's alright. Shall we order? Kitchen closes soon. Yeah. Honey. What's she done now? I should go back, Dan. She didn't mean it, she's just desperate. Jesus Christ Anna, you've gotta toughen up. She's leached off you her whole life. No, you're not going back. We're gonna have a nice meal, forget all about her. You know? You're not responsible. But I... No, listen to me. Just let her stew in her own juices for the evening. Hmm? She's doing it to herself. Hey, you and me. Yeah? That's all that matters. Get out of my house!! GET OUT!!! Claire. What the hell are you doing? Claire! Claire! This is the best place for her right? I know Roy. It doesn't make it any easier. I know. So sorry to keep you waiting. Mrs. Tate, George Medhurst. Nice to meet you. So basically, the results of the MRI scan show that there are absolutely no obvious abnormalities with the brain. Ahh, that's a good thing right? However, she has been extremely distraught. We think we've got the seizures under control, she hasn't had another one since she came in last night. So, where do we go from here? Well, I would like to get her on a DOLS. A deprivation of liberties. So there are some bits of paperwork that I'd like you to look at and consent forms that you need to sign in your own time. Mm hmm, certainly. Can we see her? Um, I think you'll find her extremely unresponsive. She's on a drug called Clozapine, which brings on extreme exhaustion. She's basically just gonna be sleeping all day, whilst being very closely monitored. Listen, if you want to just drop her things off, she couldn't be in a better place. Okay? Thank you, doctor. Oh my baby. I brought your teddy. I'm going to read you a little story. He had created the Earth and the heavens and they were beautiful. The earth was a huge garden, fruitful in its bounty, but he was lonely and longed to have someone to share it with. So one day, he created a man from dust and named him Adam. And so that the man too was not alone he created a woman, also from the dust, as his companion. And the creator called her Lilith. When the creator ordered that the woman lie with the man she refused, and the creator felt that as an insult as he had given her life. He cast her out from the garden, scorned for an eternity. So this time, the creator took a rib from Adam and fashioned another woman. In times of fear and darkness, it reminds us of the Lord's power. Could you come and see her? Her Father may not want me to see her. This is not about them. Please? Please come and see her? But she must accept the Lord, for him to take a step towards her. Anna. Are you alright? I'm sorry. I have to go. There's someone in here! Are you gonna tell Dan? I dunno. I wonder if it's a boy. Sorry? Just thinking out loud, trying to work out why she made me attack you. Who Claire? Honestly who do you think made any of this happen other than you? This is way too much, I can't take it. You tried to stab me Claire. No! It wasn't you, it was her! I need some time away from this, I'm sorry. Come on sweetheart, It's time for your medication. How close were you to your grandmother? Nana Abigail? Yeah, I'd pop in now and then, but she preferred to be on her own. To be honest her mind had already started going by the time we were teenagers. I knew Abigail from the village. In many ways, I saw her as my opponent. She was involved in some pretty unchristian practices. They say her mother was the same. I knew there was a fire when she was younger. I believe she lost her two brothers. It's the family history that makes me more inclined to believe that what Claire is experiencing is something out of the ordinary. Abigail once showed me... masks, that Dorothy made after her sons died. She referred to them as her family. She must have been severely traumatised. If you let the devil into your life, you have to fight to get back to God. I believe that Claire is the victim of Abigail's dabbling. We were never allowed to speak about this with Nana. Mum and Dad... Well, Mum really, was militant with her. We need to see Claire as soon as possible. She must be prepared to let me help her find a way back to God. But does that matter? Can we not just do something for her anyway? Please. How did it all go with the Padre? Um, yeah. He called my dead grandmother a witch. I don't know Dan, it was odd. You know what I think don't you? No. What? I think that you should move in with me. I kinda got used to having the whole house to ourselves. That's sweet. But... With everything that's going on with Claire, can we just put this conversation on hold for a couple of days? Oh come on. She's in the best place now, right? Jesus, Dan. Look, just let the doctors do their thing. Come on, there's a glass of wine then head back to mine yeah? I wanna go to bed. I'm knackered Dan. Why you assing about in the dark? And why is there Chardonnay all over the floor? Well? I was getting wine. I dropped the bottle. And? And what? That's what happened. Are you alright Dan? Wake up! Claire? Can you hear me? Claire? You've just had a nightmare sweetheart. I'm sorry. Oh, I'm looking for my parishioner Claire Tate. I'm Father John O'Shea. Hi, nice to meet you. Umm... I'm really sorry but Claire is just not up for receiving visitors at the moment. Oh? She had a very restless night and she's highly sedated today so, I'm sorry. Oh, could I come back later perhaps after she's had some rest? Maybe. Umm. We are going to be monitoring Claire very, very closely over the next few days. Her family are very keen that I see her. Yes, but she's highly delusional so maybe you could come back in a day or two? Is that okay? Has she mentioned her visions, Doctor? Yes, she has, she's said a lot of things. But I believe that allowing you into see her now, A very vulnerable, a very suggestive young woman, I believe that, would be perilous. You're not a religious man, are you Doctor? I believe there's a time for faith, but this is a time for medicine, and luckily, the modern world agrees with me. Medicine is a kind of faith and you're behaving like a zealot. So you think I should be treating Claire with Christian prayer, rather than anti-psychotic drugs? Is that it? Not everything can be explained by science, Doctor. Ok. I wouldn't expect you to understand that. Where were ya? I was asleep. I knew it though. It's this house. We can't be in this house. Fuck off to work, then Dan, and give me my fucking house back! Fine. Fine! Leave us alone. Leave us alone! Leave us alone! Leave us alone! Put her on the bed. Anna can't see her like I can. She'll get Anna next. Anna. Anna, are you...? What's going on? Are you sleeping? What is this? What do you want me to do Anna? Do you want me to call the doctor or what? Anna, we can't stay in this house, hon. Fuck this! I've gotta go. I'm sorry. I think it's time for your bed bath now. Don't you dare fucking touch me. She asked Lilith to get rid of her husband. Now then... This one will be called... Father. And this one will be called... Edward. My beautiful, beautiful Edward. We've been trying to tell you. It's going to happen again. She's not strong like you. Oh God! Visiting time is over, Father. Lilith! Lilith! Can we get some help here please? Don't you come near me. Give me the glass Claire. No! Lilith! This is what you want is it? Claire I can help you. Back! Or so help me God, I'll cut my throat. Is this what you want? You want me dead so you can have Anna and her baby. Well I won't do it! You're stuck with me. Claire! Hi. Hey. You need anything? Dan! I'm fine. It was just a long absence. But I'm back now. She... Didn't even notice. Daniel! Are you deaf? Sorry honey. What do you need? Hm? Well, this one's hungry. So is this one. Fuck you. I've won.
