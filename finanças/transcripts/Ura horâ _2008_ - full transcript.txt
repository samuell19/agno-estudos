Translated by SOTAR - Illegal Horrors - Forbidden videos. There are some videos that are sealed and can no longer be viewed. We will show you a few of them now. However, promise... That you won't regret daring to watch these videos. - Video send by: A former employee of a TV station - Until recently, I worked at a TV station. I found out that we're putting out one horror variety show. And there was a problem on it. In the end, this show was archived without being released. I decided to look it up. In general, its name speaks for itself. - The cursed shrine - - This is an edited version of a program that was taken off the air - Let's start shooting right away. Today with us is ****. Yep. Have you climbed mountains before? Yes. - Actress: Aya Sato (fictitious name) - Anyway, when you climb the mountain, there will be a shrine. Now we'll give you its name... Give it to her. You must read it, but not say it out loud. Don't say it and don't show it to the camera. Have you looked at it? Yes. Read it? Take it away. Okay. What you are read now is the name of the shrine. People says that if you know the name of a shrine, you are cursed. People call it the cursed shrine. Yep. Only two people know the name of the shrine - you and the assistant director ****. Only you. And you can't tell it to anyone. And to get rid of this curse is not so easy - you need to pray in this shrine. You have to get to it. Understand. Only you two know. You can't tell anyone the name. - They say that if you don't pray in this shrine, you will be cursed and go crazy - About a month ago, a thirty-year-old boy suddenly threw himself off the roof of a house. Really? They wrote that there was a connection to the shrine. But I don't think so. The hospital said he looked bad. Oh... By the way, she's coming with you. You didn't know? No wonder, you're cursed. What is it? What is it? I hear a sound. Sound? I don't hear anything. Were there any sounds now? There wasn't. Can't you hear it now? No, nothing at all. Guys, can't anyone hear? No, no one hears. Are you all right? Sorry. - The video of the meeting is cut off at this point - People says that in the depths of this mountain there is a cursed shrine. And I am going there at once. - The search for the shrine dragged on and it got dark - We still couldn't find the cursed shrine. What happened? This is an assistant ****! Hey ****! ****, can you move? Can you answer? She's bleeding... Can you move? - The assistant director came down the mountain. The rest of us continued our search - Isn't that it? Here's the shrine, which people call a cursed one. People says that if you know the name of this shrine, you are cursed. And I know its name. I hear a voice... Voice? Let's wrap it up. That's it, I can't take it anymore! I want to go back! We'll be done as soon as you pray. All you had to do was pray. Ah? So pray. Everything is fine. - WARNING: further viewing may cause serious harm to your physical and mental health - Hey, what's wrong with you?! - Please pay attention - - To the upper right part of the screen - - Video sent by: Former employee from TV - Until recently, I worked for a video company There was a huge video archive, and my job was to digitize it. While sorting through the videos in this archive, I accidentally stumbled across one video. It looks like a tape from 80's years. There are no labels on it. - Thoughtography - - This is an edited version of material found in one of the video production companies - - The tape is in very bad condition, so it's hard to make out the audio - The video begins abruptly. Holding a polaroid camera to the forehead The man presses the shutter. It looks like he's doing thoughtography. - Thoughtography: The supernatural ability to transmit one's thoughts into pictures - The man with the glasses seems to have a supernatural ability to thoughtography. The photos lying in front of him show a wide variety of images. All of the pictures show something that is not in the room. Among the many pictures are those of people. This photo shows Nakamise Street in Asakusa. - Nakamise - The other is almost entirely black. On it... E X P O 85. It is possible to distinguish these letters and numbers. This photo was taken in 1985 at an exhibition. - Expo 85: International Technology Exhibition held in Tsukuba in 1985 - The man talks about the photos so calmly, as if it were the norm for him. But absolutely every photo is amazing. The grainy photo shows Several people, as if dancing in the background of the trees. He says it's a photo of Takenoko Zoku. - Takenoko Zoku: In the 1980s, young people danced on the crossroads of the Harajuku district - In the almost entirely red photo you can see the silhouette - Tokyo Tower. The whole photo is red. Because the color of the Tokyo Tower, red, has spread throughout the photo. Moreover, if you look closely, you can see the highway and the bus at the bottom of the picture. In other words, it is impossible for an ordinary person to take a photo like this. It was taken from too high a position. At the director's suggestion, a man wearing glasses points the camera at other employees. It's an experiment to capture someone who is in the room. However... One of his hands in the photo has disappeared. Moreover, part of his face disappeared behind the noises. Finally, he will show a place outside of Japan. He says he will show something on the TV screen. However, since it is a complicated technique, he is not sure he can do it. And then he manifested on the screen... - WARNING: further viewing may cause serious harm to your physical and mental health - The woman was clearly looking at him. Could it be that she had noticed the thoughtgraphy? It's not often you see an accident on TV during a show. - Video sent by: A distributor of illegal videos - However, there are people who are willing to pay to see this kind of content. We find something interesting and resell it. This video is one of those, it was filmed on the TV channel ****. But it never made it on the air. - Spoon bending - - This is an edited version of a program that was taken off the air by a local station - Introducing two illusionists from the Napoleonz team, Ueki and Koishi. - Pleased to meet you! - Pleased to meet you! Here's what we have! This thing makes a man's head spin 360 degrees! We will now demonstrate this. It can't be! Let's go! How cool! Amazing, guys! You said that today you called a miracle man with supernatural powers. Now we are going to judge whether these abilities are really miraculous or whether they are a hoax. Absolutely! Sorry for the wait. Let's call this miracle man with supernatural powers! We present to you ****! Here you go! Hello! Hello! Hi! - This is said to be the first appearance of a miracle man on TV - Hi all, my name is ****! Nice to meet you! For as long as I can remember, I have always been able to bend spoons. Is that so? I've never had a problem bending spoons. Is that so? So, this time everything will be all right, too. You said it yourself. Speaking of spoons. We discovered an interesting phenomenon the other day. Let us show you. Here's a plastic bottle. The most ordinary bottle. And we put a spoon in it. Right. And now the spoon... It's starting to spin! Awesome! Who else can do that? Guys, what do you think, is there wire? Wire? Wire? No wires! There's nothing. Take a closer look. Just a string. There is no wire! Look at this spoon. Yes. This spoon will be used by **** for demonstration. We Napoleonz specifically went to the store and bought it. Exactly! So that you have no doubts. Yes, it looks like the most common spoon. Apply force to it and try to bend it. To test its strength. Of course. It doesn't bend! Yep. - The bending of the spoon begins - Well, let's get started. So far, the spoon is not bending. It looks like the spoon is starting to bend. Now it is very noticeable. It will bend soon enough. The spoon bends! It bends! I didn't expect **** to bend the spoon. I thought you couldn't bend it. It's still solid. Please. True, the place where it was bent is perfectly solid. - Five children are chosen to try their hand at spoon-bending - You. You, from the back row. Have a front-row seat. In truth, anyone can use the same power I showed earlier. Especially, this power is easy to develop in childhood. So, guys, use your power. Have fun and bend your spoons! Okay? Okay! Imagine as if you were running two balls through both of your hands to your fingertips. When you have these balls on your fingertips - put them in a spoon. Let me see. Here. Watch. And here. Isn't that cool? Cool! If we use this power for peaceful purposes Then all wars can be stopped. World peace is in your hands! Now this spoon. We'll put in here. In other words, is it possible to bend this spoon without using hands? Good. I'd like to borrow your powers, guys. Imagine your favorite color. Pass this image from your head to my hand. Well? Imagined? There you go. I feel your power! It's flowing! Very beautiful power! The power is gathering little by little. - WARNING: further viewing may cause serious harm to your physical and mental health - Watch closely. It's pretty shocking video. - Video sent by: An employee of a medical device company - Before this video came to me, it looks like several other people had it. There is evidence That this video was leaked by someone from the outside. But originally the video was stored in some institution. This is a video of the experiment, which was conducted in the strictest secrecy. - Out-of-body experience - - This is an edited record of the experiment - Done. Here you go. Everything is ready, we can start the experiment. Is everything okay? This is the last one. - It's been about 50 minutes - - The white object moves and changes - - After that something even more unusual happens - Um... What is it? Behind! Behind! - WARNING: further viewing may cause serious harm to your physical and mental health - Behind! Behind! All in all, it's a pretty ordinary place, but... But suicides often happen there. - Video sent by: Matsuda (fictitious name) - I wanted to know the reason, so I started looking into it. I installed the camera. The camera can shoot 24/7. And a few people... Really committed suicide. And the camera caught it. All of them before the jump... Were looking at something. - The jumping woman - When viewed from the bridge, In the parking lot under the bridge... There's some kind of black, I don't know, stain. And it's shaped like a pointing arrow. Perhaps when people see it, they jump off the bridge. There's also a banner in this parking lot. It shows the mascot of this parking lot. The sight of this mascot makes you uncomfortable. - The author of the video, being nearby, noticed that the man was looking down - Hello! Excuse me... What were you looking at now? Just tell me what you were looking at. You were looking down. You were looking at the stain, weren't you? The stain? Nothing. Or the parking banner? People have killed themselves here before and looked at something. What do you think they were looking at? Nothing. It has nothing to do with it. What were you looking at? The banner? It doesn't matter. There are a lot of people committing suicide here. Yes. So I decided to figure out why. Sorry. So could you tell me what you were looking at? I wasn't looking anywhere. No, you were definitely looking down. Stop filming. Sorry, I just saw from nearby place... I told you I don't want to talk to you. Excuse me, but tell me... Get away from me! Sorry. - This man died instantly - - The author of the video went to the woman who was staring down intently - - What happened here? - - The woman who jumped died. The man who fell on her survived - - Video sent by: Tanaka (fictitious name) - This video belonged to a relative of mine. He died because of an accident on the road. I was going through his stuff and I found this tape. I was very surprised, what could it be? When I watched the video, I was disgusted. I had never seen anything like that before. For some reason my uncle never told me about this before. - Mysterious Meatball - You still haven't caught anything? I understand how to do it. It feels like you're not going to catch anything today. Yup. This weather is especially good for fishing. Agreed. Yes, the best weather. We have to catch something. Hey, what are you doing there? I'm shooting. Oh, it's biting! It's biting! It's biting! Cool! Huge! Caught it! It's gigantic! Perch caught! Perch! Well done! Awesome! - Three co-workers from the same part-time job were having fun fishing - Do you understand how to fish? Ah?

There! Oh, really! How disgusting! What is it? What is it? It's huge! Look how huge they are! What the hell is this? Wait, put the camera back, shoot it. Wait, wait, wait! Let's catch them. It's amazing what strange things we've discovered. Suzuki... There's no sign of them here. Cool! How cool is that! They must be there. Let's go take a look. It's dangerous here, be careful. Did you find it? Did you find it? Nothing. They couldn't have gotten very far. Where did they go? I don't see them. This way! What is it? Here! Where! Ah, here they are. One of them!

She was an erotic idol. - Video sent by: Nakajima Manabu (fictitious name) - And I was the cameraman and filmed the process of creating the photo album. Anyway... After this video, she started having problems. She ended up in the hospital Maybe I shouldn't have shown that tape. Because after that incident she went crazy. Anyway, that's the way things are. After all, her photo album didn't come out. And my video was archived. - Assault on Idol - - This is an edited version of a shot of the process of creating a photo album - I bought it and it was out of stock. Really? It's so hot today, huh?

Ugh! What happened? I was stung. Are you all right? What is it? What's wrong? Are you okay? A bee stung you? Yes. Why are you shouting like that! Are you all right? Hah, yelling like that over a bee sting! This is the first time I've seen a reaction like this, ****! This idol really annoyed me. Usually, in these situations they say something like, "Are you okay?" And she started laughing at the top of her voice. If I asked her a question, she pretended to be disgusted with me. And if one of the supervisors came up, She immediately broke out into a smile. It's my job. I'm not a stalker. The last one? Yes. Okay, smile. Done. What is it? Bees. Bees? Let's do it again. Sorry. No, fly away! Are you okay? They flew away. Let's move on. Great. What is it? Ugh! Again? Bees! Stupid bees! - WARNING: further viewing may cause serious harm to your physical and mental health - Don't just stand there! - She disappeared from sight - - But then she was discovered... - In my college days I was a member of one club. - Video sent by: Goto (fictitious name) - And we had one party.

Three! Touch it! Hey, wait! Isayama, with whom we were there... Suddenly he killed himself.

I think he always have long hairs. - Me? - Yeah, you always have the same hairstyle. Always went with long hairs, yes. 090. Why are you laughing? Hooking up with a girl? It's nothing like that! No!

She's definitely alone. She's a beauty! Just beautiful! This woman was sitting in the bar. From the very beginning she seemed strange to us, because she was alone, but as if she was actively talking to someone. Did you know her? No, I didn't know at all. First time you've seen her? Yes, a complete stranger. Doesn't she remind you of anyone? Not at all. Okay, bye! See you soon! Why? Bye! Wait, why so early?! Come on! Where shall we go? Joji? How about there? There again? It's cold outside. Let's go to my place. Home? Well, okay. It can't be helped, so let's do it this way. When the drinking was over, we decided to continue drinking at one of our houses, and headed for the station. The next piece of video we shot while standing at the station. - WARNING: further viewing may cause serious harm to your physical and mental health - Our party isn't over yet.

At that moment, we didn't know if she was waving at us or at anyone else. But now I'm sure she was waving at us. - Pay attention - - On the right side of the screen - It can't be. Are you okay? Are you OK? What we do is we intercept video over the radio waves. - Video sent by: a voyeur - We can intercept radio waves over long distances And spread the video in no time.

Maybe he overheard? - Morning - - One minute later - - Night - - 11 minutes later - Probably not. Hold still. Hey! Takagi Maria here! - Reporter: Takagi Maria - Tonight you and I are going to go into an abandoned building. It is said that Toshio, who is an exact replica of the boy from the acclaimed Ju-On horror series, is often seen in this building. We'll be sure to get him on camera today! - Toshio - Today we will be accompanied by the director of Ju-On, Takashi Shimizu! Director, please! Hello, I'm Takashi Shimizu. Nice to meet you. Pleased to meet you! Thank you for coming. - Ju-On director Takashi Shimizu - This Toshio must look like the one I invented. I want to look at him. In other words, who is this Toshio? Director, let's find out! Let's go! Are you all right? Let's go! - We went to the top floor, where people saw Toshio. We had already climbed quite high. You are determined. - Very determined. - Thank you. It's amazing how much trash there is. I wonder how long the building has been abandoned? Isn't there someone behind the column? We should have a look. Maybe our guest is there. Toshio! Oh, stop it! What the hell was that?! It wasn't me. - There was a sound from somewhere... - The flashlight is dead. Is everything okay? Yeah, it's okay. Maybe the wind? Man, that's scary. It's still so quiet. What's this? What's that over there? Let's get closer. Let's touch it. Touching. Ugh! Disgusting. What is this?! - There's a sound again... - Director, what shall we do? Sound. Did you hear it? Аh? Anyway... I'll go and have a look. Stop! Wait! I'm off. Director, don't go! It's dangerous to go alone! He left alone... Director! - In search of director Shimizu, we went down the stairs - The stairs still lead down. Things are piled all the way to the ceiling. There's a lot of stuff piled up here... I'm going to move on. What was that?! What just happened?! There's something there! Come on, come on, get there. What is it? Above. Even higher. Left! Left! There! He's gone! Gone! Well? Are you okay? - Since Maria Takagi refused to go any further - - The director of the show decided to ask producer Ise what to do next - Takagi... Refuses to participate in the filming further. Director Shimizu has disappeared... He's back? How long has it been? - Director Takashi Shimizu returned home saying, "It's too dangerous here" - Producer Ise is asking for you. Hello. Thank you for your concern. Yes. We finish shooting to the end. - The filming continued - What was that?! I'm not going any further. Turn off the flashlight. What is this?! No, I can't. Why? Why? It's okay. Nothing bad happened to us. There doesn't seem to be anybody here. - WARNING: further viewing may cause serious harm to your physical and mental health - What happened?! I don't know what to say. - Follow-up report! The cursed shrine - When this video came out, I was scared. I met that girl a year ago on the set and we became friends right away. - Aya Sato (Fictitious name) - She had to go places with ghosts as part of one variety show. After the shooting, she said that she had developed night paralysis and began to hear strange noises. Here's a e-mail from her. This e-mail, "Help," was the last. "I can't do this kind of work anymore." "I'm really scared, help me." - Communication with Aya was cut off after this letter - I found out her office number. They told me there that she stopped going to the office. Alas, I was not given her address. - However, it was possible to see the footage - Producer Ise collected all the footage, and among them I heard that there might be something on the video related to her. - Among the videos Ise collected was that video - Among all the materials Was something I had heard about from ****. That's why I asked to have this video shown to me. - This was the last video that captured Aya - I wondered if I could find her or contact her. I consulted with Ise and he gave me the address and offered to do an interview. I don't know if I can do it or not. - We visited the home of Aya's parents. - Aya's mother - - After the negotiations, a small group of people were allowed to film the conversation - ****, I'm going in! ****! Your friends are here. It's been a long time. She says, "It's been a long time". ****! Remember her? I brought your favorite cakes **** Excuse me, I'll be right back. OK. ****! Cakes, remember? Let me help. ****! Here's a tissue. Mother! And I brought a plate. It's okay, I'm sorry. **** eat normally, come on. Well, come on. Is it good? Sorry. At first that job was offered to me. But I refused. And they gave the job to ****. I mean, it had to happen to me. - She said she would go to the shrine with the film crew - This is it, isn't it? What is it? What happened?

This is my daughter ****. - Saki (fictitious name) - Suddenly I felt like something strange was going on. It started about four months ago. She started talking in a strange voice. She became aggressive, throwing everything around. Sometimes everything calms down and it seems as if the problem has disappeared. But I always feel something strange. Excuse me, can you stop? I get it. Yes? A powerful spirit had taken possession of her. Sorry for the intrusion. Immediately Katayama began to prepare the magic to exorcise the spirit. Saki will be locked in a room. The red cloth is needed to seal the spirit. To prevent Saki from hurting herself, all dangerous objects will be removed from the room. - 1:00 a.m. - Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom, it hurts! It hurts! It hurts! Mom! Mom, it hurts! - Dawn - As soon as the morning light came out, Kagayama immediately went into the room. ****! ****! Medium, is she all right? She is OK. ****! ****! ****! - Saki was sent to the hospital - Then Katayama returned to complete the magic. At that moment, the camera captured an incredible sight. One of the spirits living in the house Entered the child. Now I'm going to kick him out and seal him up. This concludes Kotoyama's work and she returns to Manami and Saki.
