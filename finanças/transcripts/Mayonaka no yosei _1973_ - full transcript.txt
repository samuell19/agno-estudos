I will really stab you if you come near me! I don't think a kid like you can stab a person. I just robbed a house earlier! If I want to stab you, I don't need any excuse! You're saying that a kid like you actually robbed someone? You are making me laugh! Bastard! Akemi! Don't make me laugh, you kid! What are you going to do? What are you going to do? Come!
