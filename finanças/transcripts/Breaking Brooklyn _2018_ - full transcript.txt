Two, three bucks. [driver] Hey. Come on. I want your soul in there. Let me hear it. There you go. [man 2] Dance it like you feel it. Stay together. There you go. Don't think about the next step, just take it. Uh-huh! [gasps] Good. There, there, there, there. Some acids and metals react to each other to produce hydrogen. Yeah, have a seat, Mr. Davis. [clears throat] You gonna say hi, or what? Here! [boy] Hey, guys. Ugh! You stink. [teacher] Partner up. Uh... No. I work with Gina. Well, it'll be nice to mix it up, right? Now, that's not much of a lunch. Take mine. I haven't touched it. No, thanks. I'm good. You have a name, son? Why? I just wanted to know if you wanted to take my class next year. If you can't dance, it's fine. We'll start you slow. It's hard to explain, but I can't. Thanks, though. Yo. Check out the new merch. Right? Zombie Santa 3. - Good movie. - Dope. - No. - So, what... Wait, hold on. Hey. [in Latino accent] You know you want it, papi, come on. You sold me some garbage the last time. What you talking about? All right, I'll make it up to you. Buy Zombie Santa 3, I'll give you 1 and 2 on the house. - It's the perfect trilogy, man. - Don't want anything from you. - Leave me alone. - Hey, God bless. - You got your tail between your legs. - Man, shut up, man. Can't win 'em all. Hey, what's poppin', Aaron? Hey, you hungry? I guess. Really? Don't give me that. I'm being nice. Whatever. Hey, you know what? I was gonna buy you a burger, but not if you're gonna mope around like a little bitch, huh? - I'm not moping. - Hey, take a sip, little man. - Are you serious, ma... Hey! - [friend] Yeah. Come on, what are you doing? - Don't be a dumbass, man. - [friend] Come on, man. Later, guys. [friend] Later. - Hey, Aaron. I got you. - [brother] Come on. [friend] Aaron, don't let him get to you. Mmm! - I wish Dad still worked here. - Mm. Should we go back and get one for him? Why? He doesn't get us jack. He tries. I'd rather spend my cash on a lady friend instead. But you don't know any ladies. Bullshit, man. Ladies love me. - Yeah, right. - Hmm. Oh, great. [Dad] Hey, I got enough for the Ritz tonight. [grunts] You ever gonna fix this thing, huh? [Dad] What are you, my mother? Jump in. Come on. [laughs] - [Aaron] It's not funny. - [Dad] Kinda. Oh, crap. [policeman] Hey, it's a no-standing zone, pal. Yeah, I know that. Sorry, sir. I've been meaning to take her in and get her tuned up. [engine spluttering] [engine splutters then starts] Um... We're in the middle of a move. All right, keep it movin'. Yes, sir. [Dad] That was close. Dad, if he ran your plate... I know, I know, I know. I'll figure it out. [holiday music playing on stereo] What? No burger for your old man? I can smell the onions on your breath. And something else. [TV] And with a lead of 32-17... Have you seen my screwdriver? Nope. - [Aaron] Did Dad take it again? - [Dad coughs] [coughing] Nothing on. - [Aaron] Wait, go back. - Knock yourself out. - [Aaron] Nice throw. - Nice catch. - [Dad] Who's next? - Me. Not this musical shit again. You and your moms. [brother] Did you take Aaron's screwdriver, Dad? No, I didn't touch it. Well, at least there's some eye candy. You know, the first date I took your moms to was to see Cats. She loved that stupid show. I stood in line for two hours to get those tickets... just to watch a bunch of grown-ass men... prance and sing around in cat costumes. [chuckles] Shoulda seen her smile. She was so beautiful. I'm glad you guys look like her. Enough of that. Aaron... here. Don't hurt yourself. Do you think I can take dance next year? [Dad scoffs, laughs] [upbeat music plays] [whoops] There you go. [whoops, hums] [girl laughs] [laughs] - Hey, Gramps. - Hey, baby girl. - How was your day, huh? - Pretty good. - Yeah? - Not as good as yours. Oh, boy. I'm havin' the time of my life here. Whoa! - Playing your song. - What? Oh, wow. I've gotta get another album, mine is scratched. That's... That's Lincoln Center, '76, '77. Hey, we were good, you know that? Yeah, Greg... I had this, this... Afro, and Greg had this Jheri curl, you know? Every time he danced, Jheri-curl juice would spill all down the front of him. [laughs] - It's true. - For real? Yeah. Oh, here, wait. [music continues] This is the encore. Now, when he danced this, you know... those women out there, they'd throw their bra, their panties, and these groupies would come in and grope him... I'm gonna st... No, I just threw up in my mouth a little bit. All right, all right. I wish you wouldn't baby that man. I baby you too. Ouch! [woman singing] ♪ Oh, happy day, oh, happy day ♪ Let's go, let's go! Praise to the Lord. Hallelujah. Take care of yourself. Hallelujah. Well, you know the drill, so take your thumb outta your ass and pitch in. I'm gonna close out some deals today and then we'll go out for some fine dining. Applebee's is not fine dining, Dad. Well, aren't you freakin' fancy, huh? And what if you don't close any deals, huh? Then I'll go to the blood bank. All right? I don't know. Okay, I'm gonna take off. I'll be back. - Time is money. - Yeah, yeah. Enjoy yourselves. All right. Come on. Hey. Hey, hey, come on. I've got a better idea. [brother] What? [Aaron] Come on. Anybody wanna buy a MetroCard? There's $50 on this thing. Buy a MetroCard here. Anyone wanna buy a MetroCard? [cheering] Hi, little dude. - Hey. - Yeah. Cool. Uh, ladies and gentlemen. My little brother and I, we're out on the streets, so... any little bit helps, so please, give what you can, thank you. - Thanks, God bless. - What you doin'? We really appreciate it, thank you. Sorry, man. - Yo! - Thanks, guys. All right, thank you. Hey, thanks very much, very kind. Thank you. Yo, what are you doing? This is my crowd! - I was here first! - I'll cut you in, all right? - How about I cut you up? - What? Back off! Back off, he's just a kid. No, you back off! You back off! Let go of him! - Get off of me! - [officer] Back off. - It's my spot! - Come on! What are you doin'? - [drummer] It's my spot! - [Dad] He's a kid! [Dad] They got me in bracelets because you had to go prancing around. I don't believe this shit. There you go. You're good to go. Thank you. [Aaron] Hey, wait. Ain't got a permit, kid. Sorry. Perfect. Well, can I at least go now? Yeah, as soon as you're cleared. You guys gotta split. Why? You know why. I'm sorry, Dad. Yeah, I'll find you when I get out. - Go. - [Aaron] Go! - [straining] - Hey! Hey! Get back here. Stop! Hey! The Pacer. Son of a bitch. No, no, no. Come on! [girl] Gramps, watch this. [music plays on phone] He's got potential. But anybody can dance with sneakers on them. The kid's dancing on the one... Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute, I know this kid... I know this... [buzzing] Miles Bryant. [automated message] This is the Brooklyn Credit Union. Our records show that the account of Greg and Miles Bryant is... - Who was that? - Nobody important. Was it one of your groupies? Yeah, one of my groupies. You should see this one too. Boy, she was built just like that, boy. - No. - Yeah. - [laughs] No! - I mean it. Why don't you do it? Come on. Because Ms. Loretta would see me coming from a block away. Right? - It's gotta be you. - Right. Do you wanna eat? Do you want to eat? Don't gimme that. Get your ass in there. Go. Hurry up! - I'll take my time, thanks. - Jeez. Hey, man. Watch out. Hey, whatever, man. [Miles] Hello, Ms. Loretta. How you doing? [Loretta] Hello, Miles. I'm doin' great, thank you. Hey, hey, hey. This ain't gonna happen. No, no, you're not gonna be stealing from my cafeteria. - Now, no, you in trouble. - Hey! Stop! Hey. That's enough. Enough. Okay? You come with me. This way. [Loretta] This don't make no sense. And I see you, Albee. Where's that damn janitor at? Larry! I did some investigating. And it looks like their dad is in county for the next 12 days. Yup. I gotta call Child Protective Services. Oh, no, no. Carver, no. Come on, now. You... You want those boys to spend Christmas in the system? Come on, now. No, I'll take care of them myself if it comes down to that. You don't have to do that, Miles. Yeah, I know, I know I don't. But they seem like such good boys. They're in a little bit of trouble, that's all. I'm gonna call the station. - You're a good man. - Yeah, yeah. I know. [door creaks open] [sniffs] [groans] Hey, guys. We can't let you leave on your own. But I spoke to Randy and he said you can stay with me until he's released. So, this afternoon, after the class, you will come to my apartment and... maybe you can get a home-cooked meal and a hot shower. How does that sound? Kinda creepy. You just invited two students over to your house for a hot shower. No, seriously, though. You will be staying with me for a bit. We'll be fine. But thank you for the offer. No, no. There's no debate. You're gonna stay with me, or Carver's gonna call Social Services. All right? So, come on. Let's go. Let's go. Come on. Hey, Aaron. Yeah? How'd you like to take my class? - Yeah? - Yeah. Password is ABC123. - Seriously? - Seriously. Look, I'm 70 years old, what do you expect? I do the best I can. All right? All right, everybody, listen up. Want you to meet Aaron. He's gonna be joining us. All right? Circle up, circle up. And Aaron, you pick up what you can. Here we go. [music plays] Don't forget that the Best In The Boroughs is comin' up in two weeks. And the prize is $40,000. What's that? [girl] The big dance contest. [Miles] Five, six, seven, eight. Let me see what you got. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [cheering, whooping] You've got it. - [all] Yeah! - Yeah. Come on, Aaron. Bring it on, boy. Bring the love in the room. Let's do it. All right! Get down, baby. Yeah. All right. All right, there you go. - Yes. Yeah. - [cheering and whooping] Oh, yeah. Uh-huh! Yeah. - [Miles] Yo! - [all] Yeah! [Miles] Whoa. All right. - Pow! Yeah. - [cheering, applause] Whoa! All right, y'all. Now, just remember. You go to bed, you keep those shoes on. And don't you eat too much turkey. You get the itis. Happy holidays, and I love you madly. [cheering] - [girl] Hey, Gramps? - [Miles] Yeah? - You ready to go? - Yeah, well, we should talk. So Mr. B is Faith's gramps. Nice. You know her? She is one of my lady friends, yes. We got two more. Is that... [Aaron] What is this place? [Albee] It's a friggin' karate dojo, what do you think? Used to be something special. [Aaron] What happened? [Miles] Time. [emotional music playing] [Miles] This isn't exactly the penthouse. We have two bedrooms. And we have this couch over here which is a... sofa bed, it folds out. If you guys don't mind, you can crash there. We won't be staying. Huh? Maybe we should. [whispers] I can take care of you. I know, but just until Dad gets out. [whispers] We don't need him. We can survive on our own. [Aaron] It's warm here. - [Faith] Gramps? - Yeah? I borrowed your iPod. Just as long as you what? Remember to put it back where you found it. [clears throat] Well... you know, I guess if Aaron wants to, we can stay. Oh, good, good. We have two rules. The theater is off-limits, okay? And so is my granddaughter. [drops fork] - So much for your lady friend. - Shut up. [laughter on TV] [Miles] Hey, Aaron. Do me a favor and take that garbage out. - Yeah. - Thanks. [tap shoes tapping] [chuckles] Albee, it's 10:30. Get your butt out of bed. [groans] [shoes tap] Hey. Remind Faith to take you and Albee down to the thrift store little later, okay? What's the matter, son? What's this? What's what? Nothing. But it says to open now. I already know what's inside. It's not the first time I got one of those. It's from the bank. Yes, everything is cool, got everything under control. All right? - Okay. - Good. Is he still asleep? Albee! Wake up! You keep this TV on all night? Huh? Who said that was a good idea? - Where's the remote? - What's with all the shouting? We fell asleep watching a movie. Our guests are raising the electric bill is what the shouting is about. Okay, Gramps, you fall asleep in front of the TV all the time. So calm down before you have a stroke, okay? What? Did something else happen? No. Hey, Albee, I'm sorry I went overboard. I haven't had much sleep. [shoes tap] [dance music plays] [music continues] What you doin' trespassing in my theater, white boy? I'm staying with Mr. B. - Miles? - Yeah. I see you've met my brother, Greg. - Wait, you're brothers? - Mm-hm. Long story. What are you doin' here? That door's not supposed to be unlocked. And I told you, this theater is off-limits. And that's my iPod. You took that without my permission. I'm sorry. Look, I bring you into my house and treat you just like my own. And the first chance you get, you burn me. - What's going on down here? - Let me explain. Speak up. Come on. I was practicing for you, okay? Practicing what? Come on. In your class, you talked about a competition, right, with a cash prize? So... I thought I could win. Use the money to help you out, so the bank doesn't... You know. [sighs] You're a pretty sharp kid, you know? I'm 12. I know stuff. [laughs] Oh, that's very nice of you, kid, but unfortunately... it's gonna take more than $40,000 to get me out of this hole. Hey, come with me. Got something to show you. Go on. [shoes tap] What size shoe you wear? Seven or eight. You're a pack rat, huh? Oh, no, I'm not. My brother is. He lives in that old dressing room over there. - He does? - Yep. [Miles laughs softly] [sighs] We used to have an act back in the '70s. This is all of our stuff. Wait a minute. Here. That's a good one. Try these on. Seriously? I don't want you wearing those raggedy old things all day, and don't mistake kindness for weakness. You're gonna earn those shoes. First thing in the morning, we're going to training... and get your feet to work. So, back in the day, were you and your brother famous? We had a few fans. Did you guys have a big fight, or something? What makes you think that? Me and Albee fight, but after, we make up. What happens if you can't make up? We squash it. - We're family... - [Faith] Gramps? - Gramps, you need to come upstairs quick. - Hmm? Oh! Like I said, I didn't arrest him because, you know, one, the paperwork. Two, I used to puff at that age but I never inhaled. Yeah, yeah. Hey, you sure you don't wanna keep these? It's all right. I already helped myself. Yeah? Let me see. "Devouring children one chimney at a time." I love stupid horror movies. But it'll probably suck. The next guy who busts him, though, he might not be so nice. Thanks, man. - Take care, Mr. B. - Take care. [Albee] But it's not that big of a deal. Here's the rule, here's the rule. You be quiet and I speak, okay? You got very lucky today, very lucky. I decided to give you a second chance. Hmm. Now, as long as your father's away and you respect my family... you have a home with us, wherever that might be, all right? You go, help the kids wash those dishes. Hey! Hey! Excuse me! Um... Do the Bryant Brothers still live here? Hey, listen, come back! I know someone they need to meet! [Faith] Uncle Greg, one of your crazy fans is lurking outside. [rattles locked door] [Greg] Who is it? It's me. Your only friend. Thank you. - Thanks again. - You're welcome. Hey, why are you locking your door all of a sudden? In case one of Miles's transient crackers sneaks back here. Well, they're not juvenile delinquents. They're just two kids from school. Whatever. Can I eat this now? You can... after you tell me your decision. I'm gonna pass. You're gonna pass on having Christmas dinner with your family? Been passing for years. Why stop now? Mom was right. You two are worse than small children. How's it looking in here? You promised to start throwing this stuff out, Uncle Greg. And you promised to take voice lessons from me. Touché. I guess stubbornness runs in the family. Night, Faith. Just one more thing. [Greg] Hmm? I'm not gonna be bringing Christmas dinner down this year. So, unless you wanna go hungry, you're gonna have to come up for it. [laughs] [Miles] When you first walk into the theater, you have to take a deep breath, all right? Let's do that first. Take a deep breath. Breathe it in. One, two, three. [both inhale then exhale] Now you are home. [Greg] Actually, it's my home! You supposed to stay upstairs! [Miles] Be quiet, you old grump. We'll be out of your hair in a little while. [Aaron] Hey, Greg. Wherever you are. All right, let's get this thing started. Get up there on stage. I've noticed three things about you. First thing, you got no rhythm. Second thing, you can't take choreography, and the third thing is you don't know how to tap. - I can tap. Watch this. - Let's see. [snores] That's very, very bad. You gonna listen to me now? You're gonna tap on your right foot. Now, it's just brush, spank, step. Let's see it. Let's start. Brush. - Let me see. - Brush. - Yeah, spank. - Spank. - Brush, spank, step. - Step. There you go. No, lemme... Loosen this up, loosen it up for me. Loosen it up. Come on. - Brush, spank, step. - Spank. All right. Speed that up. Let me see that. Brush. - Brush, spank, step. - All right, stop, stop. You know your left foot and right foot have got to go together. Let me see the right foot and then the left foot and see if you can make them match. Come on, let's go, come on. Left. You're gonna make me throw up. Gee whiz. Whoa! We got a lot of work to do, boy. - Let's go. - [inhales] We're gonna get there, not to worry. What's this breathing? Come on. You said, breathe in the theater. Okay, breathe in the theater. Come on, let's go. - [inhales] - You finished breathing? Come on, let's go. Brush. Hey. Now the other one. [taps] [Miles] All right. There's some hard work to do now. You following the tradition of some great tap dancers. So you can't be playing that cute card. You are going to have to produce.

I'll be however I want. Now, remove yourself. [door slams] [Miles] All right. Good set. We got a long way if we're gonna make any noise in that competition. But I'll teach you the rest of the choreography tomorrow. And thank you. [Greg] Too bad you teachin' him all wrong. [Miles] What you got to say about it? Plenty. Watch... and learn. Kid... The step... is not this. No, no, no. The step... is this. It's called showmanship. This one gonna teach you a lot of bad habits. If I was you, kid, I'd be looking for a new teacher. You're pretty good. Hey, wanna come to the Best of the Boroughs? I'm competing in it. Thanks, but... I don't get out much these days. What? I haven't seen my brother dance in a long time. [funky music plays] [Miles calls out a beat] Good. Go. Is that it? Keep it up, don't stop, don't stop. [music continues] [music continues] Eat your heart out, Bill Bojangles Robinson. - Come on, let me treat you. - Absolutely not. You know you want to. Over the leg, slap the floor. This is Greg's favorite step, you got to do it. - What? - Don't do that. Fine. [shoes tap] [Miles] Yeah. Looking good. Think I'm creating a monster here. [laughs] Albee? Hey. Hmm? What? You think Dad's all right? I'm sure he's fine. Go to sleep. Excuse me. I didn't mean to startle you, but are you Miles or Greg Bryant? Maybe. What's it to you? Longtime fan. Yeah, you must be. We sure don't have that many new ones. Greg Bryant. This is your final notice. You have until January 2nd to bring your account up to date... or the sheriff's gonna remove you from the property. That was cold. You didn't have to pretend. It's not pretend. I grew up in this neighborhood and I remember coming to this theater as a kid. - January 2nd, huh? - Correct. Well, I hope you guys figure something out. I'll be prayin' for you. Miles... [distant Christmas caroling] [Albee] So, why don't you sing in public? Hmm? [Faith] Who said I don't sing in public? Me. Well, you don't even know me. So your opinion doesn't matter. Wow. Why are you always so stuck-up to me? I'm not stuck-up. Then answer my question. My family are kinda like Broadway legends. Exactly. So what's the problem? They probably have like a ton of connections, right? Yeah, except everyone would compare me to them and I just... I just don't think I can handle those kinds of expectations, you know? Lame. - Excuse you? - It's a lame excuse. You got a great voice, Faith. Don't waste it. I'm gonna stop you. - Nope. Come on. - No. - You're spillin' my hot chocolate. - I don't care. - I'm not gonna sing. - Yes, you are. You're gonna sing, I'm gonna sing, we are gonna Glee this shit up. Hey, is it cool if we sing with you guys? - Albee, no. - Cool, thank you. It's gonna be great. It's gonna be great! And I'm gonna do it with you, okay?

The contender. Right? - Hey, guys, come on. - Yeah. - [Randy] Hey! - Dad! [Randy laughs] How are you? Welcome back, jailbird. I've done my time. Well, look at you, huh? Well, aren't we fancy? Where you going, Applebee's? No, we're going to a show. I got the Pacer back, we're good. Where'd you get the money? I paid a visit to the blood bank. Sperm bank wouldn't take me. [laughs] So, you can say thank you to Mr. B. Get your things together, we're outta here. No, we're not going with you, Dad. Aaron's dancin' in the competition tonight, that's the show. It's kind of a big deal and we're actually running late, so... You wanna come? Not to no dance competition. Fine. But Mr. B has been training me. Yeah, well, your prancing days are over, twinkle toes. Let's go. Come on! [claps] He's not goin' with you. - Oh, you're a big man now? - Bigger than you. [Miles] Hey, Albee, back off. Hey. Why don't you let your kid compete? We'll talk about the details later, okay? - Who died and made you king? - Ah... I said you could watch my kids, not keep 'em. No, man, it's not like that. You know, he worked real hard. You should see him, man. I don't wanna see no son of mine dance on no damn stage. Stay here for a couple of days, there's room in the theater. At least until you get on your feet. How about that? Screw him, Mr. B. He's a bum. Oh, I really wish you had died instead of Mom. You want me to die? - You keep 'em. - No, Randy... - I'm outta here. No! - Randy! No, Dad! - No! - Let him go. Let him go. All right, you and Albee go find some place to sit, okay? Me and Aaron are gonna go and check in. - Kill it, little man. - Break a leg. Stay strong. Let's go. [dance music plays] [man] Such an alpha bottom. You need to be more of a Glinda. I am a Glinda on a good occasion. Let me be alpha... Oh, my God. Look who it is. - [man 1] Mr. Bryant! - [man 2] No. There's an open seat right here. Would you do us the honor? [music continues] [Greg] Thanks. My name is Christian. I'm a huge musical-theater fan. Oh, could you tell? I'm Basil, and you'll have to forgive my partner here, he's really drunk. Anyway... You know, it's kinda funny that I'd run into you here because just a few days ago, I was outside the Bryant Theater looking for you and Miles. I think I might've scared your daughter. She's your daughter, right? I mean, I was late and it was dark, but I didn't... Would you leave the nice man alone, please? Does the name "Frank Goodman" ring a bell? Of course. How you know him? This is his son. Really? Your daddy was the best manager we ever had. Like family. [song ends] - [man] Yeah! - [cheering] [announcer] Representing the Stages Performing Arts School... - Guys are good. - Yeah. [Miles] It looks good, but something's missing. You know what that is? Huh? It's dance. How is dance missing? Dance is a homeless kid who hooked up with a street drummer so he could make some change and feed himself. It's family. It's a kid dancin' the truth. What do you feel right here and right now? Use it. You dance it. [cheering] Hey. Tell your story. Okay? [announcer] Please welcome Aaron Davis. [music starts] [Miles] Easy, now. You're a pretty sharp kid. [Randy] Your mother was so beautiful. You shoulda seen her smile. [Albee] You're gonna crush it tomorrow, little man. [Miles] This is gonna hurt me more than it hurts you if you don't do it just right. [Aaron] You think I can take dance next year? [Miles] Tell your story. [Randy] I don't wanna see no son of mine dance on no damn stage. [Miles] It'll take more than $40,000 to get me outta this hole. [Greg] What, do you think you're good? Well, you're not! [Aaron] Dad! [voices distort and overlap] [Randy] You want me to die? Done. [clattering, microphone feedback] - [music stops] - [microphone feedback] It's just so loud. [crowd gasps] [yells] [indistinct whispering] [announcer] Well, um... next up is Blue Crew. [man] Yeah! [electronic music playing] [indistinct chatter] What happened out there? Nothing. Didn't look like nothing to me. Why'd you run away like that, son? Because I don't wanna do this anymore! I hope you lose your small, tiny, shitty, crappy theater! I'd rather sleep in my dad's car than listen to one more of your lectures! Son! [girl] They're announcing the winners! [announcer] Before I announce the winner... I'd like to congratulate all of our dancers. The winner of this year's Best Of The Boroughs is... Travis Diaz. [Travis] Yeah! Yo, you go, T! [audible heartbeat pounding] [groans from audience] [shocked gasps] Hey! [Miles] Aaron. Aaron! - That's it, I'm outta here. - Yeah, call the car. Come on. Let's go. [man] Move it! Well, this isn't working. Let's get the hell outta here. Everyone, please stay seated. The situation is under control. [Albee] Hey! Slow down, man. Come on! Hey, hey, hey! What are you doin', huh? Where are you goin'? [tender music playing] [Albee] I'm glad you didn't want to go back to Mr. B's. [Aaron] I can't. Not yet. I know the feeling. Faith's gonna tear me a new one. Look at this. He never forgets. Yeah, he'll surprise you now and then. [Aaron sniffs] I'm ready. Me too. Bye, Mom. [Albee] So, what was that all about back there, huh? Well... I'm not supposed to tell you, but Mr. B really needed that money. - [Albee] What? - Yeah, so apparently... [Faith] You spent all of our money but didn't have the balls to tell me? Faith, you just watch your language, don't be coarse. Oh, I'm sorry. You... You don't get to lecture me. Not tonight. No, you forfeited that privilege. Baby girl, please, come on out here and let's talk. Greg had no right to interfere. - Now you wanna talk? - Yeah. Okay. Well, then let's start with you explaining why you lied to me for however long. When were you gonna break the news, Gramps? When the sheriff showed up to evict us? You were the one who always said we should never lie... never keep secrets. I guess that didn't apply to you. So what I wanna know is what are we going to do? We got a lot to figure out. - Yeah. Yeah, we do. - Yeah. That's an understatement. We don't have anywhere to live. We have to find a new apartment, we have to find people to help us move! - Shh. Calm down. - You want me to calm down? Okay. Okay. So let me get this straight. You blew all of my college money. You've been lying to my face, and you want me to calm down? Gramps, we're gonna be homeless in a week. I... I can't believe you call yourself a role model. I really... [door closes] [sniffs] You... ever get the feeling that your whole world is collapsing... and that you're the architect? - You should've told me, Gramps. - Tell you what? We're gonna lose the house? What kind of thing is that to tell your granddaughter? I took those boys off the street... and now I'm gonna put 'em right back on the street... and we're gonna go along with them. It's hopeless. Gramps. Gramps. [sighs] There's always hope. I know things seem bleak, but the storm will pass, right? The only way to start the next chapter is to turn the page. You taught me that. I taught you that? Are you sure? - Yeah. - [laughs] [laughs] [sighs] Okay. [whispers] Okay. [sniffs] Gramps wants to see you in the theater, Aaron. Just couldn't help yourself, could you? Had to assault that poor guy. He was a douche. Aaron deserved to win. No, he didn't. What? It's the truth. And... what are you gonna do if they press charges? Take it like a man. Look, can you just be serious for, like, a minute? God, what crawled up in your ass and died? I'm sorry, I thought you actually wanted to change. I do, but in case you forgot, our dad ditched us yesterday. Right. And you think you're the only one who's had it rough? God help me. How blind can you be? I don't know, but I'm sure you're gonna tell me. How 'bout this? The bank's foreclosing on the theater and kicking us out in the beginning of January, and we have no idea what we're gonna do. Buy an RV and take the show on the road? Would you stop? This isn't a joke, Albee. You know what? You need to grow up and stop running around like some little freeloading punk who thinks he's some sort of Casanova, 'cause you're not. [scoffs] Wow. Albee, I didn't mean that. Sorry about all that bad stuff I said. You know, that stunt you pulled last night, it was not okay. But Albee punched someone. That ain't got nothing to do with what you did. You let your emotions overcome you. Last night, you lost control of your story. Hey. Look at me. You're gonna get there. You know that, don't you? Hey, hey. You are going to get there. Okay? All right, now, let's get up here. Come on. Come on. This is yours. You act up like that again, I'll have you clean up this whole damn neighborhood. Take it. What's the point? The point is, this is our home. Take the mop. You get to work. [tender music playing] What are you doin' here? Just lookin'. So this is it. This is what? Where you live. Don't touch it. [Aaron] You did movies too? I thought you didn't get out much. I used to get out a lot. Back in the day. I had quite a reputation. I hope I can dance like you one day. Well... you keep workin' hard, maybe you'll get there... If your brother don't screw you up first. What do you mean? Nothing. Never mind. Story time's over, kid. Hey, Aaron. Look at this. You know, Miles was a renaissance man. Directing, choreographing, he did it all. But... Greg's the one they came to see. He was the headliner. There was a car accident, right? Yeah. Gramps fell asleep at the wheel. I mean, he came out of it all right, but... Uncle Greg, he... He hurt his back pretty bad. Never went on stage again. Where have you been? Thinking. Well, while you've been jerkin' off... I cleaned up the whole theater. Well, actually that's exactly what I was thinking about. Yeah, I bet. I'm talking about the theater, smart-ass! We gotta figure this thing out. You know what, Albee? Can you just help us pack? No, listen. My boy Corey's raising money for his sister on Indiegogo. You can make, like, a ton of money on there. Okay, but don't we need some kind of incentive to encourage people to donate money? [whispers] Yeah. I know what we could do. [hip-hop plays, shoes tapping] So that's what they're calling music these days? What, you don't like hip-hop? No. I don't. I like soul. But you wouldn't know nothing 'bout that. - Hip-hop has soul. - [Albee] Yeah. - Run-DMC, Dr. Dre, Ice Cube. - [Miles] Greg. Hey, hey, hey, wait a minute. Greg, come back here. Greg! I got something to show you. Come on. Look at this. Come on, look. You know what this is here? These kids here are using our name to help raise money so we can stay here. And so far, they've raised over $2,000! [Aaron] People love this theater. And they wanna see you guys back on stage again. I think it's worth a try. It could be our last shot. Y'all can do this internet deal, but... we ain't performing again. [tuts] No. Don't nobody wanna see that mess. I do. Well, let Aaron do it. Nobody really wants to see Aaron. I'm just a kid. You're legends. And look at this. "The Bryant Brothers have been in hibernation for too long. I can't wait to see them perform again." Look how many likes you got. Likes? I don't care nothing about no likes. Do you care about me? Of course I care about you. But maybe all this is for... the best. So I guess we won't be seeing you for Christmas dinner, then. You just gonna let him go? It was a good idea, but maybe we should start thinking about... packing up and getting outta here. I know we said we weren't doing presents this year, but I couldn't help myself. Merry Christmas. Thanks. Merry Christmas, Gramps. - [Faith] Like it? - [Aaron] Yeah, I love it. [Albee] Are you sure you didn't get our gifts mixed up? [Faith] Open yours, Gramps. What? Where did you find this? - Albee helped me. - [Albee] I have my sources. Wow! [Aaron] Can we play it? [Miles] I've got a turntable in the bedroom. Let's do this. [laughter] [tender music playing] [music playing] [shoes tap] It's your wake-up call. Look, I know it's Christmas morning, but if we're gonna do this show... you better get to work. Yeah. All right! Yeah, you ready? [both laugh] - Let's get up. - What you got? [Miles hums] Bop-bop! You may have to adapt, Greg. Come on. This is... I can't go out like this, Miles. I can't do it. I can't embarrass myself. Let me talk to you, man. Come on, man, this is years ago. You don't have to do the big thing all the time. Take it easy. - Give me! Just give 'em to me. - No! - Just give 'em to me! - No! Uncle Greg, we need... Let me see you just sweep the floor. - Remember the shake and sweep? - The sweep? Yeah! ♪ Everybody ♪ Yeah. Big show, Bryant Theater. ♪ Everybody, uh-huh ♪ Check, check. Check one, two. [Miles] I know you're having fun, but I'm gonna need you to step. Bam. Right? All right? No, no. No, not my hat, not my hat. - No! - No! Faith, please! Give me a "Hello, ladies." [laughter] Hello, ladies. I'm done, y'all. [singing scales] - Bryant Brothers. - Thank you ladies and gentlemen! I don't know how I'm gonna get through this show, though. I'm tired. Me too, man. Let's go sit down somewhere. - Whoa! - Hey! [Greg] All right! Looks like we're getting ready to do this again. Doin' it again. [upbeat music playing] Oh, really? - [Faith giggles] - [Miles] Uh-uh-uh! Knock it off. Pretty girl. - Gramps, look at this. - What? He raised $25,000 in a week and that is not including ticket sales. Which should add up to another ten grand. That means we have another 60K to reach... We may have a situation here. - What? - Yeah. You guys hang tough. I'll be right back. Okay. Here, let's go sit over here. - Okay. - This one here. This is so exciting. I mean, the Bryant Brothers! Chéri, well, the last time I saw you two this excited, Kristin Chenoweth was selling a Crock-Pot on QVC. [Miles] Hey, man, open up. The crowd's gettin' restless. We need to make an announcement. Ah, just give me a minute. Just a minute. Hey, Greg? Greggy! You try. He listens to you. Uncle Greg? You know you really should see this crowd. - They're excited to see you... - Leave me alone! What's wrong? What's the point? The guy they came to see... is gone. And he ain't coming back. Back me up, okay? - Come on. - [Miles] Baby, give me a minute. Hey, Greggy. Why don't you come on out? You remember when we first bought this theater, back in '79? People thought we was crazy trying to open up a community theater in Bedford-Stuy. Yeah, we proved them wrong, didn't we, man? Stop with the... memory lane shit. - It don't have a happy ending. - Oh, no, no. It can have a happy ending, man. It can if you come outta that cave you got in there. There are kids up there waiting on us. [Miles] We're a family, man. You can do this. I can't. Yes, you can! I can't do it! I ain't got no feet! I'm an embarrassment to my name! It's because of you! You did this! You did this to me! Yeah, hey, Greg... I'm sick and tired of being sorry. I've spent the last 30 years apologizing to you. I fell asleep at the wheel, man, I'm sorry. I hurt myself too, man. I can't dance either. Gotta spend the rest of my life with a cane, man. I got a job as a school teacher. I'm trying to take care of you, man. So my granddaughter can come and feed you those freaking meals every day when you hide in your dungeon. It is not my fault that you gave up on life. That you chose to hang out with those groupies. It's not my fault that you can't get up. Huh? - What you say? - I said you can't get up anymore. You wanna go, huh? You wanna... Gimme this damn cane! - What you gonna do? - When I'm finished with you, they're gonna put you in a home. You understand? They're gonna put you in a frigging home again! - Stop it! - Goddamn it! - What are you doing? - Gimme this cane. - You kiss my ass. - You kiss my ass. - Yeah. - [Faith] Stop. I'm outta here. Shit. I don't need you anymore! [Carver] People will understand. [Miles] Come on, let's go. [restless chatter] Anybody here? All right, thanks. [tap shoes walking] [taps microphone] Um... Hey, thanks for coming, everybody. Now, I'm sure a lot of you are wondering... what this little white boy is doin' on stage. - [audience silent] - [Aaron laughs nervously] Well, my name's Aaron Davis... and Mr. B and Uncle Greg... they... saved my life. And my brother's too. [Aaron] Now I'm gonna dance for you guys. And donate some money. [laughter] [Aaron] Okay? Cool. Albee, hit it. [music starts] [man] This ain't no Bryant Brothers. I want my money back. Hey, pal, this is for charity. Thank you. Sure. That's my son. - That's his son. - Son? [applause and cheering] [man] Good job, kid! [soft piano music playing] [man] Yeah!

[cheering] [cheering fades] [tender music plays] The ball drops in a few minutes, guys. [Faith] Okay, what about a four-bed in Flushing, 5400? Pah! Too much! [Greg] And I don't do Queens. [Greg] Congratulations, kid. On...? My old move. Finally pulled it off. [knocking] Hell of a show, guys. Hell of a show. I brought some people with me. I hope you don't mind. They're friends of Greg's. Greg. Congratulations. Great show. Well, is this a funeral or an after-party? We didn't raise the money. Oh, I don't know about that. You guys were fabulous. My dad would turn in his grave if I didn't do something to help you out. Who's your dad? The man who launched our career. This is for you. It's enough to save the theater and reopen it to the community. - [Faith] You kidding? - For real? Well, there's two conditions. - Here we go. - Hang on a minute, everybody. One... You have to tell me about my dad. He was always on the road with you and... I never got to know him. And? Two, you gotta let us help you with the books. What do you think? - We say yes! - What he said. Wait, wait, wait, guys, guys. Here we go, here we go. [all] Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one! [all] Happy New Year! I love you. I'm so proud of you. You were great out there, really great. - Love you, Dad. - Sorry for bein' a jerk. No, it's all right. It was me too. [indistinct chatter] - All right. - Yeah. [slow tap-dancing] - Hey. - You're a natural. Come on. Oh, no more. [Albee] See, look at this, you could've been up there this whole time.
