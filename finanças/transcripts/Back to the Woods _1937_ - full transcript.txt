[♪] Guilty. Take the prisoner away. Next case. Your Lordship, a grave situation. The three ruffians about to appear before the court are in a fit way to wreck our empire. What sayest ye? Aye, Your Lordship, only this morn these brigands attacked His Majesty's guard and did them battle on the very threshold of the palace. Bring forth yon varlets. [BALLS CHIMING] Time signal. Fifteen seconds before 11 a.m. baloney watch time. Shuteth up. Order. Order. Order. I'll take a ham sandwich. Hold thy tongue. Not tongue, ham. Continue, counsellor. Your Lordship, these rogues do lay claim to be kin to the Three Musketeers. One for all. All for one. Every man for himself. [BANGS GAVEL] Silence, ye knaves. Ye are accused of doing battle with His Majesty's guard. What say ye to the charge? I can explain, judge. You seeth, it was like thiseth. [GAVEL BANGS] JUDGE: Guilty. I sentence ye to Newgate Prison for 40 years, ye to 45, ye to 50. Forty? Forty-five? Fifty? I got 50. Fifty, 50, 50, 50, 50. Do I hear 55? Do I hear 55? Going once, twice. Do I hear 55? Who will make it 55? I shall. Thank you-- Whoo! Fifty-five years for the lot of ye at hard labor. But Your Lordship, it'll cost the crown a pretty penny to feed yon wastrels for 55 years. Why not send them to our colonies in America to fight the redskin savage? Hm, I just love corn beef and savage. JUDGE: Silence. I now sentence ye knaves to defend our colonists from the savages. Gadzooks, they'll scalp us alive. Not me. Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. A pleasant journey, gentlemen. The same, sire, to thee. Ow! Ah-- Ah-- Ah-- Ah-- Ooh-- Ah-- Ah-- Ah-- Yeah. [ALL CHANTING] Take them away. [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] The good ship Pimpernel did anchor last eve. So soon? Aye. Only one year in crossing. Well, well. [KNOCK AT DOOR] Ooh! Oh, uh, we've come to see the governor. Be thou the governor's daughters? Aye, sir. I be Faith, and this is Hope, and this is Charity. [GIGGLES] ALL: Ooh! [GIGGLING] I wouldst a word with thee, my little charming wallflower. What dost thou? I saw her first. Fish posh and tish tosh. I'll never give up Hope. Why dost thou not take Charity? I need not Charity. I'm on the WPA. WPA? Aye. Willing Pilgrims Association. Hm! All my life I hath been looking for a maid like thee, toots. Aw, give us a break, kid. I'm a stranger in town and knoweth not a soul. [SNIFFS, CLEARS THROAT] By the by, see what I have brought thee. [MUSIC BOX PLAYING] Wouldst?

[MUSIC STOPS] For shame that ye dance while the colony is in dire need of food. Who be thou and what do ye here? We be sent by His Majesty to defend the colony. Our credentials, sire. Hm, Boston Downs. Weather clear, track fast, first race, Whopper, two to one. They're off. Who's in the quarter? Whopper. Who's in the half? Whopper. Who's in the stretch? Whopper. Who's the winner? Rosemont. Who's the winner? Rosemont. Ow! The wrong credentials, sire. I am so sorry. I pray thee governor come at once. The Indians have arrived to sue for peace. Wouldst thou go to the meeting? Oh, wouldst. Come. Shoulder arms. About face. Ooh. Forward march. Peace. No more war. [GRUNTS] No more war. Give 5000 shekels. But we have no more than this. [JINGLES] Hm. Good down payment. Take mortgage on balance. Interest 6 percent. Thank goodness, at last we are free to hunt. No. No hunt till F.O.B. F.O.B.? Mm. Fork over balance. Indian givers. But chief, if we cannot hunt, the colonists will starve. [SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE] But listen, chief. Wait, we pray thee. ALL: We shall perish of hunger. Oh, woe is us. Oh, woe is us. 'Tis a chance to redeem ourselves, lads. We shall hunt anyway, and feed the colonists. Thou hast said a mouthful. I shall bringeth a moose. And I shall bringeth an elk. I'll bring a couple of odd fellows. Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. [BARKS] To the hunt.

Oh, my toe-- Give me the bird. Nay, 'tis mine. Wait. Give him the bird. How I shall gobble this gobbler. Mm-hm. [TURKEYS GOBBLING] Look, turkeys. Shh. Quick, load thy guns. What do we do now?
