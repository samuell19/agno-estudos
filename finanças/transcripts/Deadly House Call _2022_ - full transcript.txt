Hello, Ruth. Oh. You're not Irene. I had an awful night last night. My husband, I kept him up until morning. I hate to do that. Warren has his own troubles. Is this something new? That's right. Irene didn't say anything. And you finally found something that would help me keep my food down. You would think this place would improve the menu, considering my family paid for this wing. I forget what your name was. Wait, wait. - Wait, who are you? - A friend, Ruth. An old friend. I don't feel very well. Uh... uh... I think I'm having a reaction. I... Ms. Lockhart? Madison? I'm so sorry to hear about your mother. She was a, uh... A formidable woman. Should I check on your father? No, Gregory. I'll go. Hayley, honey, will you be okay if I check on your grandpa? Sure, Mom. How are you holding up, Dad? She was so beautiful, Madison. We were so happy together. Those summers at the lake house were some of the best memories I have. The best any kid would have. If I'd known that last summer would be our final summer together... I'm so sorry, Grandpa. Thank you, Hayley. - Oh. - God! Now look what I've done! It's okay, Dad. It's okay. I've got it. Don't worry. Thank you, Gregory. I don't know what we'd do without you. Well, how's the caviar, Emmett? It's from the Caspian. It was Ruth's favorite. Is that what this is? I thought it was raspberry jam on a cracker. You know, I introduced Warren and Ruth. Not that I didn't have my regrets afterwards. She was so stunning, I didn't have the courage to ask her out myself. Now, Warren, though, he wasn't afraid of anything. Not back then. One of the bravest men I've ever known. Agreed. How's Madison doing? Well, you know Madison. No matter what's happening, she's as strong as a Sherman tank. Did I hear my name? Yeah, baby. Hello, Madison. We were just estimating your resistance to armor-piercing rounds. Hmm. I have to admit, I'm not feeling so bullet-proof today. Aw, baby. Who was that helping your father? Was it another cousin I haven't met? Oh, that's Gregory, my dad's assistant. I didn't know he had one. I arranged it after my dad's last fall. I was worried my mom was expending too much energy looking after him. Madison, speaking of unnecessary expenditures, we need to have a heart-to-heart about the state of the firm. Arnold, you're like family and I love you dearly, but now is not the time. - Excuse me. - Okay, baby. I thought I'd find you here. Nia. I thought you'd be stuck in the office. Thank you. You're a life saver. - How you holding up? - I'm okay. Actually, I feel kinda numb. I'd like to think my mom and I were at peace. I don't wanna add to your day, but Arnold's been after me to arrange a meeting. Mm-hm. Schedule it for Monday. Are you sure you don't need some time off to process all this? You mean cry, let it all out? My father's gonna be all alone in this great big house for the first time since forever. He needs a rock, not a sponge. Sorry to interrupt. There's somebody here to see you, Maddy. You and your dad. That's my cue. Come on. Hi, I'm Madison Lockhart. Are you here for the reception? I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to pull you away. I just wanted to drop by and extend my condolences. Rebecca Wilson. - This is my husband Emmett. - Hi, nice to meet you. Thank you. These are beautiful. I was, um, one of Ruth's nurses. I like to think that we were friends. Oh. Oh, God! Excuse me. Do you mind holding that? Not again! It was just an accident. Here, I'll take that. Thank you. I am so sorry about this. We had a bit of a misunderstanding with the catering crew. I told them to get out of here. What the hell are all these people doing in my house? Dad, these people are here to pay their respects. They're here for Mom's wake. Ruth? What happened to Ruth? Dad, Mom passed away three days ago. Don't you remember? Dad, are you okay? Are you okay, Dad? Can someone call an ambulance, please? Warren? Warren, my name is Rebecca, okay? I'm a nurse. Listen to me. I know there's a lot going on right now but I need you to breathe with me. Do you think you can do that? One, two. Okay, okay, good. In? ...Two, three. Perfect. Now out. That's it! Very good, very good. Just breathe. Everything's gonna be okay. Everything's gonna be all right. He's barely past retirement age. He's only 67. He's had his memory issues but I never... Early onset dementia? It's likely lain dormant, triggered by the stress of the past few days. We need to run a few more tests. So, what happens next? There's a rough timeline we can expect to follow. His ability to make decisions will continue to decline. Basic daily tasks will become challenging and then almost impossible. Eventually he'll rely on others completely for his care. You'll wanna start planning before that time comes and arrange a transfer of power of attorney. All of this will only become harder to implement the more time passes. I'm truly very sorry. He's asleep for now. Gregory, you've done enough for today. Thank you so much. It's almost 10:00. You must be exhausted. It's no problem. I'm happy to do it. Has anyone seen Hayley? Oh. Rebecca? You're still here. I thought we sent everyone home. I was uh, about to go and I saw some caterers ducking out. There was still so much left to clean. One dish led to another, and... Anyway, I should go. No, no, you don't have to go, Rebecca. My mom's not being very hospitable. Wait, Rebecca. I'm sorry. It's just been a very long day. Thank you so much for staying back and helping. Of course. Oh! Uh, by the way, I fixed up a late night snack. I figured by the time you got back, you'd both be pretty starving. Wow. Thank you. Wait, you're not staying to try some? That took us like two hours to make. Unfortunately I've got a big day of job hunting tomorrow. You're not at the hospital anymore? Sadly no. I was just filling in for someone on maternity leave. I'm really happy that Warren's doing so much better. I left my phone number in case you need anything. Anything at all. - Thank you. - Of course. She's so cool, Mom. She's like Mary Poppins without the accent. Thought you were popping in to gloat. I've been here six hours. You've barely been out a month, Jesse, and you're already complaining about having too much free time? I saw an opening. I couldn't pass up the chance to look around. So? You found it? No. Not yet. I'll need more time, and opportunity. Bingo. Barely had a chance to grieve for Mom, Emmett. Now this? Honey, I can stay with your dad if he'll have me. Gregory can look after him tomorrow during the day. Honey, I can't ask you to do that. I know you're swamped at the gallery. We don't know how long it's gonna take to find him proper care. I am not leaving this house. Dad, what are you doing up? I have Gregory. He's more than enough. Dad, Gregory's just a personal aide. He's not qualified to deal with this kind of thing. I'm not getting placed into a home. Of course not, Dad. I hear you. I'm listening. We'll figure something out. I promise you don't have to leave. Gregory, right? Rebecca? Hi! You come here too? After a day like today, you bet I do. Two more of what he's having? So, how long have you been working for the infamous Lockhart family? Not long. Madison... Ms. Lockhart... She just hired me a few months ago. They've been good to me. Why do you call them "infamous"? Oh, you know what they say. Behind every great fortune is a crime. Oh. Where is that from? I feel like I've heard it before. How about you buy me another one? Hey. Well, this is it. I've never done this before. There's a first time for everything. Stop! What are you doing? You just received a powerful dose of temazepam. You should be comatose or worse in about 78 seconds. Don't worry. It's completely undetectable. Your loved ones will just think your heart popped. No one'll have to know how much you suffered first... Just you and me. Unless I inject you with this. What... what do you want? Tell me where Warren Lockhart's files are. I know they're somewhere in that house. In his study, in a locked drawer, in a safe maybe? I... I have no idea. Please, I'm just a personal assistant! I don't know anything about any safe! Oh, okay. I believe you. I do. It's just... You're still in the way. You still need to go. Must feel strange sitting in that chair. His chair. I wasn't sure I ever wanted this. Taking over the family business? I thought I was happy working three doors down the hall. Well, if there's one lesson I've learned after ten years of arranging people's schedules, it's that life rarely suits our timelines. Arnold's here. For that meeting? Bring him in, please. - She's ready. - Thank you, Nia. Madison. How's Warren holding up? As best can be expected, under the circumstances. He's angry, he's frustrated. Quite frankly, he's scared out of his wits. To see him reduced to this. You said it was urgent that we speak. Before his retirement... Warren made a number of bad investments, as you know. I have tried to stop the bleeding as best I could, but... I think we need to sell. My father bought this pen when he signed his first contract. pen is maybe the first thing he bought for his job. He's used it to sign every contract that's crossed his desk since. Now you're asking me to sign off on ending his legacy. We faced this before. We can push through again. Perhaps. But my advice as CFO is to sell now, while the Lockhart family name retains its value. Thank you, Arnold. I'll take it under advisement. Madison, time is of the essence. I just finished burying my mother. Now you're asking me to sign away my family birthright. I said I'll consider it. Listen to me. Warren has been my best friend and my mentor for 35 years. I would never do anything but protect him, and his family. The Lockhart legacy is a lot more than a name on a building to me. For all of us. What do you think? Is he right? I suppose it all depends on what happens next. You mean it depends on me. - What is it? Is Dad okay? - Your dad's fine. He's in bed reading the paper. It's just... Gregory didn't show up this morning. Really? He's been so dependable. Dad hasn't eaten yet? No. Thank you. I'll take this up. Morning, Dad. I brought you breakfast. How you feeling? Fine, fine. Where's Gregory? He didn't show up. We've been calling him all morning. That doesn't sound like Gregory. Dad, there's something I wanted to talk to you about. I spoke to Arnold this morning. Let me guess. He wants you to sell. That's exactly what he said. I knew he was up to something. Sell the company that my father built from the ground up from nothing but his two bare hands? Dad, Arnold's been our family accountant since before I was born. He's always looked out for us. If he truly thinks it's the right decision to sell, then... That guy's stealing from me. I can't find my watch. The one Ruth gave me on our anniversary. Why would Arnold steal your watch? Look. Here it is, safe and sound. Hello? Madison Lockhart speaking. Okay. Oh. Okay. - Thank you. - What is it? Who was that? Gregory won't be coming in today. I'll see if Emmett can take the day off. I don't want Emmett. I've got you, I've got Hayley, I've got Ruth. Dad. Mom... she's... You just eat. I'll be downstairs. The police just called. Gregory was found unconscious inside his apartment. They think it was a drug overdose. He's in a medically induced coma. An overdose? He didn't seem the type. I don't know how much longer I can keep this up, Emmett. I can't keep breaking it to Dad that Mom died. It's gut-wrenching. Dad thinks that Arnold's stealing from him. Arnold? Is there any chance you could look after Dad for the rest of the day? I have to get back to the office. Honey, you know how busy I am with work right now. We need more than a Band-Aid for this. We need to find a long-term solution. What about Rebecca Wilson? She was great with Warren the other day. We don't even know if she's qualified. We're talking about some specialized care here. Would it hurt to look at her resume? I don't know. She's still a stranger. Honey, I like her, Hayley likes her, your dad likes her. Besides... she knew your mom. Where the hell did they hide you? Hello? Rebecca Wilson speaking. Hi, Rebecca. It's Madison Lockhart. Do you have a minute? Of course, Madison. Is everything all right? How's Warren doing? To be honest, not so well. I was hoping you might have some time to come by the house tomorrow to discuss a job proposal? I'd be happy to, Madison. How's 7:30AM? That sounds great. Thanks, Rebecca. We'll see you tomorrow. It's all coming together, Jesse. We're finally getting back what's ours. So, how do you see this all working, Rebecca? I'm gonna have to rely on your expertise. Of course. Well, first and foremost, I'll act as point person between you, Warren, and the hospital. So, tracking all of his progress, sharing that with his doctors, taking him to all of his appointments. Really just sparing you all that shop talk. And what about meals? Ah, nutrition is of vital importance. I took the liberty of developing a daily meal plan based on Warren's age, height, and weight. A healthy diet, regular exercise, and mental stimulation is key to slowing down any sort of cognitive decline. And of course, a walk in the park every now and then doesn't hurt either. Great! This all looks terrific. I'm gonna verify the references and hopefully you can get started in a few days. Um, excuse me. Mm-hm? Okay. That was work. I have to get back to the office. Oh, But I told Emmett I would take care of Dad today. Oh. Well, uh, this might seem impetuous, but given the circumstances, I'd be more than happy to start now, if it'd help. Thank you. Yes. I left instructions on how to reach me in an emergency, but I'll have my phone on me all day. And the keys are by the door. My dad's meds are in the cabinet in the master bedroom. He takes them after every meal, but I've already given him his morning pills. They tend to make him a little sleepy, so he's just been going back to bed. Madison, you have nothing to worry about. Warren and I will be just fine. I'm so sorry, but I really have to get going. Oh yeah, no, go. Go to work. That investment firm's not gonna run itself, right? Ruth? Is that you? Hello, Warren. It's Rebecca! We met the other day? Your family hired me just to help out around here. I thought for a second you were Ruth. You have the same hairstyle. What are you doing in my room? Oh, I thought you were still sleeping. I was just looking around for some slippers for you and trying to be quiet. Where's Madison? Where's Gregory? These are all very good questions, Warren, but before I can give you some very good answers, you just need to take your pills. I don't want these. They make me feel loopy. I used to be in the office by 5:00AM. Now look at me... trapped in bed like a depressed teenager. Warren, don't forget what your doctor said. I'm only here to execute his orders, and your family's wishes. He said I'm a grown man who can make his own damn decisions! I know exactly who you are, Warren Lockhart. I know exactly what you've accomplished. We'll work through this together, with due respect and dignity. Now, please take your pills? They give me such awful dreams. Dreams of Ruth? I'm so sorry, Warren. What you've gone through the last few days, having to suffer all alone. I'm not alone. I have Madison and Hayley. That's right. Your family. What matters most, Warren, is that I'm here now. And I'm not going anywhere. You're stuck with me, Sir, come hell or high water. Thank you, Warren. Now, what would you like to do today? It is our first date, after all. Ruth and I, we used to go for a walk in the park on a sunny day like this. That sounds like a wonderful idea. I'll pack us a picnic. Now, where did I put that damn watch? I swear I left it here last night. I just keep losing things. It's okay, Warren! It's okay. I'll tell you what. We can devote our entire day to searching this house until we find that watch of yours. I can't ask you to waste your whole day over a watch! It's my pleasure. They don't call it a search "party" for nothing. I'll start downstairs and you start right here? Yeah. Ah, where could it be? Rebecca? I forgot what we're supposed to be doing. Oh, we're looking for your watch. Did you have any luck? It was a gift from Ruth. We'll find it. Don't you worry. I'm feeling pretty tired. I think maybe I should sit down for a bit. That's okay. No problem. Thank you very much for helping me look. I never imagined it would take all day. I understand, Warren. I'm not done yet. I promised you I'd find it. Well hello, gorgeous. Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. Oh, no. Hayley? - Rebecca. - Are you okay? Oh, God. I thought you were my mom. - She's gonna kill me. - Tell me what happened. Some friends threw a party after school and we needed a way to get there, so I borrowed Grandpa's car, and Penelope had this punch, and... I felt woozy driving home and I tried to park it back and the steering locked. And Mom's gonna totally disown me. Hayley, I've got this. Gimme the keys and meet me back inside. But how? That guy over there saw the whole thing. Wait here. I'll be right back. What did you say to him? Hayley. You are a Lockhart. You might not know it now, but that name holds power in this world. It's currency. It's a big, flashing sign telling people, "Money lives here. "Mess with it at your peril." It makes ordinary guys like him think twice about paperwork. I don't know how to thank you. No need to thank me. You owe me. Now let's get you inside so you can sleep this off? Yeah. - Hi, Rebecca. - Hi. Sorry I'm running so late. Did something happen here? Oh. There was a bit of a distraction concerning a certain watch. We kinda turned the place upside-down looking for it. Warren insisted we search everywhere. My dad did all this? Yeah. It's a symptom of the disease. Sadly. An irrational attachment to misplaced valuables. But the good news is he's a lot calmer now. Well, that's good. Where is he? Oh, he's just resting upstairs. You know, we had quite an active day, to say the least. Thank you, Rebecca, for stepping in on such last-minute notice. Oh yeah, of course! It's my pleasure. There is one other little item. Warren asked me to move his car and I sort of grazed the lamp post by accident and it did manage to roll a bit of a ways down the driveway before I was able to stop it. I'm sorry, I promise I'll be more careful. So, that's what happened out front. You sure you're not covering for him? It wouldn't be the first time he's tried taking out the car since his license was suspended. I assure you, your father was well behaved. Warren is a lovely, playful man. I don't think that's exactly how I'd describe my father. Heh. Also, your daughter Hayley is here. It seems she left school early complaining about a flu. So, I made her a cup of soup and I tucked her into bed in the guest room. Oh, I'll go and check. Oh, no, I'm sure she's just sleeping it off. What about you? Were you able to put out that office fire? Oh, I don't know about it being a fire. It's more like the water level rising to fill the room. Well, I was just about to start cleaning, so. Is that you down there, Madison? Dad. How was your day? - Hey, honey. - Oh. Emmett, when you checked Rebecca's references, nothing came up, right? No red flags? I called every number she listed. The ones I got through to all had glowing reviews. You still worried about this? I thought she's been a godsend. She has, and you're right. It just isn't sitting well with me, I guess. Giving someone this much access to our family. Honey. We can't control everything. We certainly can't control what's happening to your father. We're all gonna have to learn to let go a little. All the same, it doesn't hurt to double check. Is Hayley home? She's in bed. She wasn't feeling well. Oh. I'll go check on her. Strathmere Retirement Home. This is Steve. Yes, hi. My name's Madison Lockhart. I'm calling about a former staff member of yours, Rebecca Wilson. I'm looking for information about what kind of role she played at your facility. I'm sorry. Is Ms. Wilson not meeting your expectations? I think I might have spoken with another member of your family... Emmett, was it? Uh, that's right. I'm just following up. I'd like to know a little bit more about Rebecca, if possible. I'm sure you understand. What were her reasons for leaving, for instance? Were there any complaints made against her? Unfortunately, I'm not at liberty to give out that kind of information. But I can assure you Ms. Wilson left on glowing terms. We were sad to see her go. Okay. Thanks for your help. No problem whatsoever. You have yourself a nice evening. She's getting antsy. You're not as good as you think you are. She's just having a moment of doubt. She'll stop at one and feel it's enough. Trust me. If another one of those phones rings, then we might have a problem. All this sneaking around. All these games. What's the point?! When I could just go shoot him in the head? First he needs to suffer. First they need to know what it's like to lose everything. Don't you ever doubt me, little brother. Don't you ever forget who took care of you, who fed you, who protected you when Mom and Dad weren't there. - Don't you ever. - Okay. We do it your way. What did I tell you? She stopped at one. So, now that you found it, how do we get inside it? We don't. Not unless you know how to crack an Omniguard EL90 fireproof, tamper-proof home security vault. If we want in, we need the combination. The old man won't just tell us. Not unless I find the right way to ask him. Warren Lockhart needs to have an accident. - Beautiful day, isn't it? - Hm, certainly is. I'm sorry we didn't get to do this sooner. You're already looking better, handsome, getting out of that stuffy old house. Mm, all right. Lead the way. First, we hydrate. And you need to take your pills. Didn't I already take these? Trust me, Warren, your organizer doesn't lie. Ruth would've loved it here. She was such a fan of the outdoors. Is that why you bought the lake house? The one in the photos? Ruth, she used to say... What did Ruth use to say? She would've loved it here. She was a big fan of the outdoors. Tell me more about Ruth. What time is it, Rebecca? I've lost track. I thought we could stop up ahead, I hear there's quite a lookout. Are you up for that? Rebecca, I think these new pills... They're affecting my vertigo. Come on, Warren. A big, strong buck like you? You can do it! Hello? Hello? Ruth? Ruth? Ah! I spoke with Gertie in Berlin. They're amenable to the loan but the terms aren't exactly what we call favorable. It leaves us in quite the spot for the foreseeable future. It leaves us vulnerable. The question is, is it worth it or do we simply cut the losses? Is something on your mind? We're only talking about the survivability of your family legacy here. You met her, right? My father's new caregiver, Rebecca Wilson? Uh, briefly, at your mother's wake. You've always been good at reading people. You're having misgivings? Something just feels off. Do you wanna know what I think? Always. I think you're feeling guilty for not taking care of your father yourself, protecting him like a good daughter should. So you're projecting that blame onto Rebecca... Seeing fault, seeing conspiracy, where plainly there is none. Maybe you're right. I think I just needed to hear a second opinion. I'm your friend. This is what I do. Among 10,000 other things. Now, do we accept that offer from Berlin or do we listen to Arnold? I always knew that some day I'd be sitting in this chair. Making decisions with other people's money. Now that I'm here, I can't fathom the thought of letting it go. It's Rebecca. I have to take this. Rebecca, hi. Is everything all right? Madison, I don't want you to panic. Your dad is going to be just fine. My dad? What happened? He had a fall. We're on our way to the hospital. - I have to go. - Yeah, go, go! Dad? Oh my God. Are you all right? What happened? We were walking on his favorite trail and he must've tripped on a root? I'm sorry, Madison. It's all my fault. I thought I would be doing him a favor. He's just been so cooped up in that house. How is he now? Your father suffered a minor knee injury and a bump on the head. I don't see any signs of fractures or concussion. I see no reason to keep him overnight. It was lucky Rebecca was with him when it happened. She had to carry him back to the car herself to get him here so quickly. It's nothing. He's exaggerating. I'm fine, I'm fine. Enough with all the fuss. You're hurt, Dad. That knee will need time to heal. Four to six weeks with no pressure on it. You'll need to use a cane for mobility as well. I wanna see you for a follow-up next week. Thank you, Dr. Lund. Uh, what do I do now? He's gonna need 24-hour care for the next month. Can you recommend any caregiving agencies? I certainly can, but there's an extremely long waiting list for these services. It could take weeks... I don't want no rent-a-nurse! I've got Rebecca. Dad, you need someone there at night. What if you fall again? Just getting up the stairs is gonna be a struggle. You need someone there with you full-time. That would be no problem whatsoever. Are you sure, Rebecca? That's an awfully big commitment. "In for a penny, in for a pound," my dad always said. Dad? What do you think? Well, that depends. What are you making for dinner? The room's all yours. Please make yourself at home. I'm sorry I can't stay. I have a meeting early tomorrow. This'll do perfectly. I should maybe check on Warren one more time. It's okay, Rebecca. He's out like a light. I'll drop by as soon as I can tomorrow, and thanks again for taking such good care of my dad. Yeah. Madison, you've got nothing to worry about. I assure you, I've got everything under control. Ugh, damnit! Think, Rebecca, think. Ruth? Ruth. I'm here, Warren. It's me. I missed you so much. I know. Warren, I've missed you too. So much. I've been away because I'm in trouble. I really need what's in this safe. The safe? I need you to tell me the combination. There's something so very important inside. Of course, dear. What is it, darling? I can't remember! I can't... remember! I know, honey. I know. Let's get you to bed. Oh. Rebecca, you scared me. Oh, I'm sorry. I wasn't expecting you. Is there something the matter? I'm here to see how my dad is doing. How's his leg this morning? Is he up? Of course, of course. I'm just a little surprised to see you is all. Was I supposed to call ahead? No, no. Of course not. He's just still sleeping. He had kind of an off night. Oh. What do you mean by "off night"? He woke up in the middle of the night, he got a little confused. He's sleeping it off now though. I'm sorry to hear that. I'll put on a pot of coffee? Sure thing. What exactly happened last night? Is it something Dr. Lund should know about? Warren's been experiencing some mild hallucinations. Seeing things that aren't really there. Par for the course, I'm afraid, at this stage. Is he still wandering? Did you find that watch? Ah. Ruth! Is that you? Is he still calling for my mom? I should go check on him. Uh, I think I should go first. It's just... he's not expecting you. It may upset him. Upset him? I'm his daughter. Let me just peek in and make sure that he's calmed down. I'll be right back. The coffee's ready. Warren! Is everything okay? Rebecca! You know me. Of course. Rebecca. You called out for Ruth. I must've gotten confused. I had the strangest dream last night. Well, you're still adjusting to your new medication. How do you feel now? Better. Foggy. Great news, Madison's here! Oh, wonderful. Let's get you freshened up and get your cane and your morning pills. Yes? This is Rebecca Wilson. Rebecca, this is Dr. Lund calling. I've been informed you're acting as intermediary between Warren Lockhart and his family? That's correct. What can I do for you, Doctor? I'm awfully busy. I'm calling to let you know the results of Warren's blood test came back, and... I'm concerned about the levels of temazepam we've detected. I'd prescribed a small dose to help him sleep, but if these levels are accurate I'd be surprised if he can make it out of bed or function at all. We need to schedule an immediate follow-up. Thank you, Doctor. This is terribly concerning. I'll get right on that. Hi, Dad. How are you? Just you visiting, no Hayley? It's just me, Dad. Hayley's busy at school, but she wants to come see you later. Here's the coffee for you, Warren. Just how you like it. And what can I get you for breakfast? Actually, Rebecca, if you don't mind giving us a minute first? Let me know if you need anything. Okay. Come. How's everything going with you two, Dad? With Rebecca? You wouldn't have to ask if you were around more. Dad, that's not fair. I was here yesterday. It seems like you're always sleeping. I'm trying. We've been trying to spare you the details, but it's been very chaotic at the firm. In fact, there is something we need to talk about. I don't wanna talk about the firm. I don't wanna talk about any of that right now. Where's Rebecca? We were supposed to go for ice cream. Ice cream? Dad, it's 8:30 in the morn... Dad, are you sure you're okay? Maybe we need to make another appointment with Dr. Lund. No. No more hospitals. Just let Rebecca work her magic. I'll be fine. I left Dr. Lund's number on the table. I'm sorry I have to rush back to work, but if anything changes, please call me. Of course. - Hey. - Hayley! Grandpa's gonna be so happy to see you. Yeah, I picked up some of his favorite gummies. Dad told me about his leg. That's so thoughtful of you, sweetheart. He's gonna love it. You've raised such a lovely daughter. I have, haven't I? At least I got that part right. I should go. - Thanks again, Rebecca. - Pleasure's all mine. How was your visit? Rebecca. Hey, you scared me. Don't be scared, honey! Come sit, let's have a chat. About what? About you, silly! How's school? Are you seeing anyone special? I see they fixed that dent. It's almost as if that little accident of yours never happened, isn't it? You know, it's a really good thing that you only hit that flower pot. Imagine if that had been a person or your grandpa. You do remember, right? 'Cause if you need a reminder, I have photos. Wanna see? What do you want, Rebecca? The truth is, Hayley, I... I really need your help. I'm at my wit's end and I don't know what to do. Why? What's going on? It's this watch. Your grandfather's watch. It's all he talks about, all he thinks about. I can't get him to eat, I can't get him to sleep. He can't find his watch? That doesn't sound so bad. He's got like ten of them. Oh no, no. You don't understand. For someone with Warren's condition, the mind obsesses over this thing. He's convinced, absolutely convinced that he locked it in his safe. The one in his room where Grandma kept her old jewels? Hmm. If there was someone who knew a way to open it, it would make a huge difference to Warren, to both of us. I'm not helping you get into Grandpa's safe. Rebecca, that's crazy. Why don't you just ask my mom? Oh, trust me, I would, but Warren begged me not to. He's embarrassed. Your mom can have such high expectations, you know? He feels like she's judging him, belittling him. Yeah, I guess she can be like that. Look. I don't know the combination. But I know that Grandpa used to keep a notepad around. He used it to write down stuff he was having trouble remembering. If it's not here, it's probably still at his office. You should ask Nia. His office. Thanks so much, Hayley. You've been such a great help. I'll do that. I'll ask Nia. Are we even now? Of course, honey! It'll be our little secret. Okay. I got the strangest feeling in the house today. And then seeing my mom's earrings just sitting there? Your dad hasn't been sleeping well. Maybe he moved them when he was up wandering around in the middle of the night. You said he's been moving all sorts of stuff. He's an old man with memory problems, Emmett, not a poltergeist. I know this might sound crazy, but I could've sworn she was wearing my mother's perfume. You're right. That does sound crazy. Honey, why? I'm gonna ask Arnold to run a background check, if he still has those old police contacts. Don't you think... ...That's a bit of an overreaction? Honey, you've got that call to Berlin tomorrow morning. You have a big decision to make. You need to let this go for tonight, get some rest. Come here. Can we forget about this for just one night? Yeah. Let's hope no one changed Warren's codes. We'll see if Hayley was right. All right. Check every drawer and every shelf. Look for any notepads, any post-it notes, anything with a string of numbers on it. Any numbers at all. Numbers? We're standing in an investment firm! Just keep looking. Go check those other offices. This is a Crestview. This costs more than my car. Can I help you? Rebecca, what are you doing here? You have no business being here. What the hell's going on? I'm just here for Warren. He lost that watch again. Can you believe it? He's convinced that he left it here. He's in one of those moods, you know, inconsolable. I can't get him to eat, I can't get him to sleep... Not without that watch. I didn't know what else to do so I just came here to get it. It's all been really overwhelming. I'm listening, Rebecca. I'm just gonna make a quick call. Not another step, Rebecca. We'll let the police work this out. Madison. Are you all right? Your call sounded urgent. Nia mentioned that you were leaning towards accepting the Berlin offer. You know my thoughts on that. I'm not here to talk about the firm, Arnold. I told them I'll have my decision by end of day. I'm here to talk about Rebecca Wilson. What about her? You still have those old contacts? Some. What do you need? I want you to look into her for me. Maybe I'm just being paranoid, but I need to know for sure, and please be discreet. I'll do anything I can, Madison. No matter what happens, you know I always have your back, right? Something's happened at the office. What happened here? Who is that? Nia? Nia? Nia, no! No! No, no, no! Maddy, you're okay. I'm not okay. Nia, she... What happened? They think it was a robbery. There's nothing on camera. They stole the security tapes. But who? Why? What were they after, money? Client files? They ransacked the office. They're not clear what the goal was, but... Nia must have surprised them. Why would anyone do this, Emmett? Why would someone wanna hurt Nia? It's not working. I've tried every number we found. Try again. We're running out of time. I should pound it out of him. We can't interrogate it out of him. We need to coax it out. We need to trigger that memory. How? By giving him back what he wants most. What no one else can. Hello? Is anybody here? I'm here, Warren. Ruth. I'll always be here. Oh, don't worry. I've got you. Hmm. You remember this song? It was playing the first night we met. Oh, Warren, how could I forget? - I missed you. - I've missed you too. And I can't wait to catch up. But I just need you to tell me one thing, sweetie. What's the combination? Combination? Oh, you silly man! To the safe, where we keep all of our favorite things. I've left a gift for you inside. A present for my beau. We created them together. 88-04-11. The day Madison lost her first tooth. Thank you for that. You've given me so much. Wait here, honey. I'll be right back. Okay. Oh. It's all here, Jesse. Everything we hoped for. Dad was right. Now let's get the hell out of here while we still can. Wait here. Arnold! Wasn't it? I think we met at Ruth Lockhart's wake. Warren's bookkeeper. Hmm. Best Man and CFO. I'm here to see Warren. He hasn't been returning my calls. You know, it's... it's uncanny. In that dress, you're a spitting image of Ruth. Where'd you get it? Oh, I don't know. Some vintage bin down in Wallaceburg. If there's a message I'm happy to relay it. Oh? Is Warren indisposed? He's suffering a degenerative brain disease, Arnold. Yes, I'd say he's indisposed. Um, Dr. Lund recently switched Warren's medication. He hasn't been sleeping well. Neither of us has been sleeping much, I'll admit. There have been a few episodes. Uh-huh. Rebecca, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to insist on seeing Warren. I have news. Arnold. Is that you? Warren? - It's been years! - Years? Years. Warren, I... We should sit down. I need to speak to my friend, alone. There was a break-in, Warren, at Lockhart Investments. Nia was there at the time. She... I am so sorry, Warren. Nia's dead. Nia? No. Where's Madison? She couldn't come herself? Madison is still at the firm. She's speaking to police. I thought it would be better if you heard it from me. Warren, we can speak in confidence. Are you okay? Is she mistreating you in some way? What is this really all about, Arnold? Is this about my estate? What? No. Madison told me about your little plan. Out there looking for offers to buy me out. Warren, I assure you, I would never do anything that was contrary to the best interests of you or your family. Warren! Your family is my family. I trusted you, Arnold. You were like a brother to me. This is how you repay me? How could you? You were my best friend! Get out. Get out! I think that's enough. Warren, Warren, I... Please. You need to go. I'm so sorry, Warren. I'm so sorry I've let this happen. I'll be back soon. Madison, call me back right away. I've just been to see your father. Something is very wrong. Joshua. Were you able to run that check on Rebecca Wilson? But that's not possible. Are you sure? You're absolutely sure? All right. Thank you, Joshua. Please keep this confidential. I just can't believe it. She was my best friend, Emmett. I feel like my life is unraveling so fast. I gotta go see Dad, tell him the news. He adored Nia. I asked Arnold to. You have enough on your plate. You did? I got your call, Mom. Nia? Now Nia? What the hell is happening? Honey, come here. We're gonna get through this, Hayley, as a family. Just gotta be strong and help each other. Mom... Dad, there's something I need to tell you. About Rebecca. Hello? Dad? Anybody? Warren? Madison? Madison? Madison? Arnold? Oh my God. Did Rebecca do this? Where is she? Where is my dad? Oh, my... Your fa... your father... He kept secrets. Terrible secrets from you and from Ruth. Rebecca, her... Her real name is... Jane Butler. Her father was a client of Warren Lockhart Investments. This is about revenge. She has evidence, Madison. Enough to take everything. They've gone... Gone to the lake house. Don't... don't let her... Don't let her take everything we've built. Don't... don't let her. Arnold? Arnold? Emmett, can you stay with him until the ambulance gets here? What? No! I'm going with you. We'll wait for the police. It's my dad, my fault this is happening. I let Rebecca in. I have to fix this. Where are we? - We're here, Warren, at your favorite place. We're at the lake house. Was I asleep the entire drive? You slept like a baby. Come on, sleepy head. Let's go. My God. I forgot how grand this place was. We've been here before? It's all so hazy. It was a long drive, Warren. Let's get you a drink and get you comfortable. Dr. Lund said I shouldn't mix alcohol with my pills. But tonight is a special night. All those rules are so far, far away. I remember being here, once. At this lake house. Feels like forever ago. I was with my dad. And you were entertaining important clients to celebrate a banner year. I remember diving off that dock, swimming in that water. It's the last happy childhood memory I have. That summer. I suppose it makes sense this is where it ends. I'm sorry. I don't remember. Of course you don't remember. And what a relief that must be. What a weight off your shoulders. I have to make a call. But first, you need to take these. Are you sure? You trust me, don't you? After all we've been through? I'll be right back. Is it time? It's time, Jesse. Get them ready. Madison'll be on her way soon. It's time to make them pay. Dad. Where were you? At the hospital with Arnold. He... I don't know where to even start. Is Arnold okay? He's alive. He's unconscious in the ICU. He's holding on, but at his age... Where's Mom? Does this have to do with Nia? Is somebody after us? Honey, there's something you need to know. You might hear some... things. About our family. What... what kind of things? Oh, what the hell? Yes? Do I know you? Who are you supposed to be, a trophy husband? What? Who are you and what do you want? Rebecca sent me. Dad? What do you want? The three of us are going to have a talk. Take a seat and get comfortable. Emmett, I'm headed to the lake house. Call me back when you get this. Dad? Dad? Dad, are you okay? - Madison? - We have to go now. Rebecca, she isn't who we think she is. Where is she? Rebecca told me about you and Arnold and your plans for me. Rebecca attacked Arnold. She's out to hurt us. Ludicrous. She's been with me. We've been here all summer. She's poisoning your mind. We have to go now. How dare you? I'm sick and tired of being treated like an invalid. Leave me alone. Let me go! Dad, what happened to you? How did she do this to you? By giving him what he wanted. What no one else could. What did you do to him? He's barely breathing. I might've given him a bit too much. You have no idea how hard it is to eyeball this stuff without a medical degree. Isn't that right, Warren? Leave him alone. Your father and I have an announcement to make. He's reassigning power of attorney and appointing me executor of his estate. He's just not that happy with the current state of management. You understand. The only thing missing... is your signature. Is that my father's Crestview? You were in his office. It was you. You killed Nia. You're a murderer, Rebecca. You're going to prison. You're a monster. And you're the one who signs my checks. You're insane. You'll get laughed out of court. He's clearly in no position to sign anything and neither am I. You think you can convince the banks, the board of directors? They'll fight you with resources you can't fathom. They all have their weaknesses, their vices, their libidos. You'd be amazed how persuasive I can be, with the right tools. And besides, who will be left to make a fuss with you and Warren gone? Just tell me the truth. What did my father do to you? Your father... got very greedy, Maddy. He started making investments on the side using his clients' money. He lost big, and he let his clients take the fall. One of those clients was Mike Butler, my father. He took losing everything pretty hard. Took it out on me and Jesse for a while, and took himself out not long after that. Dad, is that true? Of course it's true! It's all right here in these ledger books. I know my father made some bad investment decisions, but I never witnessed him doing anything criminal. You're a gullible fool. What will any of this fix, Rebecca? Is it money you want? Let's see if we can come to an arrangement. If it's true that my father did what you said, give me a chance to make it up to you. I lost my family. My entire childhood. How could you make that up to me? I lost everything because of him, and he can't even remember! There's no making this up to me, Madison. No money can fix this. Not anymore. Put them on. Smile. Now will you sign? Or should I tell my brother to shoot Hayley in the leg? No! She needs to be reminded the stakes. Do it. Wait. Stop. I'll sign. Just... let me see them again. Let me see they're okay. Hayley, honey, are you all right? I'm fine, Mom. What's happening? What do they want? Everything's gonna be fine, sweetie. I just wanna tell you, you and Emmett how much I love you. I'm so sorry I let this happen. - We love you too, Mom. - I love you, honey. I promise, everything's gonna be okay. Sign. I can't. My hands are tied. Now what, Rebecca? Now you got what you want, will you let me go? You know I can't do that. You know I can't leave any witnesses. You knew that this whole time. But this was never a negotiation. That's what separates us, you and me. I had my rose-colored glasses slapped off my face years ago. Please, think about what you're doing. Can you live with this on your conscience? That pathetic whining tone reminds me of your mother, just after I gave her that lethal dose. What? Oh. The look on your face right now. Even Lockhart Investments couldn't put a price on that. No. You psychotic bitch! Growing up the way I did, Madison, it made me hard. It made me ruthless. Willing to do whatever it takes to get my seat at the table. You'll never understand that kind of work ethic. You're nothing but a spoiled child! You could never run an investment firm, Rebecca. You don't know what ruthless is. Dad. Jane! Dad! Dad! Who's the trophy husband now? Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do. Hayley? Emmett? Can you hear me? Mom? Mom, we're okay! I'm on my way home. They're gonna be safe. Grandpa. You two doin' good? Did the police run out of questions? Dr. Lund give your dad the all-clear? For now. How 'bout you? How's your forehead? Oh, it's nothin'. Just a bump. By the way... look at what I found. Dad, are you okay? I had the most wonderful dream. We were all back together again. At the lake house. Come on, let's go inside. What happens now, Mom? Now we work to make things right.
