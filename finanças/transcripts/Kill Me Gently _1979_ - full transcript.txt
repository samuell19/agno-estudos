I can't spend all day grinding meat They are hungry One day, you'll grind Adam like this Why, because he's making an effort instead of me? Don't lie to yourself He's my friend You'd drown him in a teaspoon of water Not really It's so steamy here, do you mind if I freshen up a bit? Just looking will drive you crazy Watch out! Watch out! You killed her! Such a precious flower! Do you have no heart? You have so many other flowers They better not eat her You don't care for my flowers, my slaps or me! You only care about Adam! Adam? What does that have to do with him? Why should I lie to you, I truly care for him If only you loved Julija as much as I love Adam Then I would cooperate with you or what? That's a hit! Watch out! I'm throwing again You'll mess up your shirt Blood has already reached my pants I hit it! My pants! Excuse me mam, do you have some gauze? Of course Your turn now David, that is not nice It's all your fault What did you do to him? Julija has exhausted him Pour some water on him and hell be okay Here, poor one You not only knew every flower by its name You even knew their secrets Your bouquets were whole novels I was working on a dissertation on medicinal plants Those bouquets that were symphonies of scents weren't made for you by herbalists In travelled across foggy mountains through rain and wind with old ladies Because only they could sniff out healing herbs for me Herbs that people used to call magical That are magical! I analyzed effects of flower scent on people Those bouquets were assembled as to enchant you No! And arouse you Slowly, you started to mix up scent of flowers and me You're lying, you want revenge because I'm cheating on you You're cheating? Have you ever asked yourself why? You don't care for me What are you like? My flowers aroused in you an unstoppable desire You're poisoned Nonsense, complete nonsense! It's true, biggest sins are missed sins I'm lucky my youth was so erotic and full of sex PHANTOM OF PASSION Such filth, dictionaries are useless, these aren't dictionaries at all! Where are all the special erotic expressions Filth ... No! Well ... You should wash you head I'll wash your head Shame your hair isn't long HANGMAN IS HAPPY "He swayed in the wind ..." No "Rope screeched ..." "Leaves were rustling ..." Kitty, kitty Where is Julija? In the bathroom She's not there Then I don't know If you don't know, I do Of course, she's with Adam Didn't I tell you? That's none of your business! Do you think I want a dead man under this roof? What dead man? Look at Adam, he's pale and losing weight He'll die because of that rude woman! It's his own fault for liking her You should care about what your wife is doing You're her husband You should protect him What if I don't want to? What if I want him to be on brink of exhaustion? Oh, you corrupt pig! Look at him, he looks so humane Excuse me Aunt! Come, Adam Do we have to get your car? Call David! No, I want Adam to sleep in my room tonight Aunt ... Come Adam, you're too young for this You've always been so naughty! Don't be afraid, you don't have to sleep with me You need some rest Go to sleep Excuse me, I don't understand anything, do I really have to sleep here? Trust your elders, boy, and you'll be healthy for a long time Now he's safe Aunt, even my mother wouldn't dare to do this Do you have no shame? Kid doesn't know anything about love He's new to sexuality and you're riding him like an ox Adam is not an ox! That's the point! If you treated an animal like that it would die on you already To Milano and no further Adam, are you sleeping? No Jump from the balcony It's too high I'll break the door! Adam! I can't! What if I cut them Does aunt have a pocket knife? Fool! You wouldn't be done by morning! – Come with me – I'm sleepy Come, everything is ready Please understand I just fell asleep Slut! You slut! Julija, Julija, Julija! Slut! I'll show you! Whore! Where are you so I can kill you! This whore is cheating on me with her husband in my own room! You teamed up with your smelly, sclerotic aunt!

See Julija, little one loves you Leave him I had no idea you cared so much about me – What do you want with flowers? – Smell them My dear little fishes Dear fishes, huh? Aunt, why are you giving your car to Cita? She's driving Julija around whole day and made her completely lose her mind I can give my car to whoever I want Isn't the car your most precious possession? If Julija is with Cita, at least Adam has some peace Did you fall in love with this half monkey, aunt! No, but you and Julija are treating him inhumanely Do you care more for him than for me? Aunt! There's something I don't understand You had always been so stubborn and demanding but you've changed You would bite and kick everyone if things didn't go your way Now, every sparrow can ... on your head No! No! Throw them away You don't like me Who said that? Little crocodile My little crocodile Go to sleep! You're not children! How can we sleep in such noise? Figure it out! Just go already!

When I was 15 I didn't even know what marijuana was They were not junkies, they ran out of oxygen due to the abundance of flowers Julija, open the greenhouse door, air it out a bit But aunt, this is impossible, my plants! This is about human lives You're right It's important to keep the greenhouse locked Good morning, good day, nice weather today Are you having a breakfast?

No, they are disgusting We're selling fish God, is there anything people don't sell I like fish, do you have goldfish? No, we have different ones A bit bigger, but very pleasing We thought, in a house like that ... Animals belong in a house like that, right? Wonderful fish belong in a house like that We won't buy anything, stop chit-chatting and leave us to eat in peace! – Do you need this cat? – Not currently Thank you What the hell do you have there? Friendly fish, piranhas What happened to the cat? Look at what they did in just a few moments! Now they are satiated and friendly like puppies Believe me, they are wonderful little fish!
