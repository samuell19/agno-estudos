but deep inside the battle's hot as hell, and let me tell you what l know quite well, comrade Tito count on us! What are you looking for, Professor? No one leaves anything behind, them or us. Forget the books, we'll read after vacation's over! lt's a shame to throw them away. Want me to read something? You really profited from those books. lf you'd taken a TV, like others, where would you plug it in? Read. Better listen to you than those pussies down there. 'We noticed it one night, when we were just fooling around. We noticed a village, our cannon was staring at. lt was still in flames. And every night afterwards at the same time, villages were ablaze on the horizon. We were surrounded by a great circle of strange celebrations going on in all those places burning in front of us. And the flames just rose up and licked the clouds...' Pretty villages are pretty when they burn. Ugly ones stay ugly, even when they burn. You would have been the best poet among my students. When you've been behind bars for so long, you come out as well-read as Rambeau. When l see such a fire l always get thirsty. What's the name of this village? -Who gives a shit! We set a place on fire and don't even know its name. We're killing each other for a fistful of ashes. lf you intellectuals had been asked, all of Serbia would have gone to hell long ago. OK, boys, let's move out! 'One village in particular looked very gay. A few houses, at the bottom of an ugly little valley, you wouldn't notice during the day. You can't imagine what it looked like at night, when it burned. You would say...' lt's all right, Professor... lt's all right... Velja, who would you sell it to? -J ust practicing. To stay in shape for later. Go ahead and practice. Good morning, Chetniks! lt's a nice day to die and you're still asleep! Good morning, dear 'Chets'! The draft here is killing me! -Milan! l'll give you this if you give my Mercedes an overhaul. What's the model? -WHF FMT... The Mercedes, dumbbell! -600. -That's my specialty. But don't blow it! -Agreed. Muslims, are you still up there? Sumadinac here. Are you still alive, men? Yes, we're alive! Hello! Sumadinac you old mongrel, where have you been? Where are you? ln a tunnel, two kilometers east of... -Kurtalici! Ask when the cavalry's coming. -Sumadinac! Men, what can l say, you'll have to hold on for a while! Good luck! -Maybe they don't have any horses. Sumadinac, old mongrel... What an unique slime you are, ...my friend. We'd better fix that truck. You'll end up the tragic heroine of someone else's news. Translate that! Closed. All good kids are in bed asleep. l'm going to tuck in those two now! Doctor, it's not a replay, give me some in advance, You'll see the bread tomorrow. Beg you pardon? l'm extremely intolerant towards such impudence! Draw! l always brought the dough, what's wrong now? Be a man! ! A man! Nurse! Nurse! Where are you, damn it?! -Nurse! Soldier, call the doctor! Nurse! You really screwed me up! Milan, please! So, General, want to look nice for your funeral... according to regulations? That's what we got in the army. And l was a lucky bum, l'd just got hooked on heroin and socialized, when they said: Go on home, soldier! Heroin was dirt cheap in '89, the year of 'dolce vita'. Keep up the bullshit. l'll get you out of this. You're safer here with me than in Belgrade with your junkies. The army didn't tighten you enough. That army of Tito's was a real traveling circus! Miss Linel wants to film us, make a story about us. Milan, how about it? No. -What filming? Out of the question! Why not? Let her shoot. ln any case they shit on us like we came from Hitler's testicles. Captain, let the kids have their fun. Let's be gentlemen... -Shoot, freckle-face. No way! ! Then they put words in your mouth with... what's it called ... editing, they can make us look real bad, sully us to hell! My name is Speedy, l am unreformed drug addict, currently getting 'anti-drug war group therapy', son of an ex-colonel of the ex-Yugoslav army who was a lush... -What are you saying, idiot? Go ahead, Speedy, get it all out, l'm next! Tell them how you stole hendicaped grannies'purses in Germany. -Don't stick your nose in my affairs! l shit on your affairs! Aren't you ashamed to steal honestly earned money? -Honestly? You're fighting just to earn another stripe, damned communist! -Velja... if you don't stop, l'll shove this down your throat! Who are you to talk about honesty, you bloody drivel! Your great honesty, you were always full of that shit. Do you think, Mr. Captain, that one single house we set on fire, or they set on fire, was honestly earned? To hell it was! lf it was honest, it wouldn't be so easy to set them on fire. As long as Tito stuffed US dollars up your ass, you blathered about brotherhood and unity, and smiled at each other. And then the time came to settle the score! Fine, but why didn't you do it earlier? lnstead you jacked off for 50 years, drove fancy cars, screwed the best girls, and now when you can't get it up, now you want to be honorable. l shit on that honor of yours and your whole honorable screwed generation! Fuck all of you... honest suckers! l'd shove your face in if you weren't wounded! lt's just a light wound. Captain, he was just joking. -Butt out! Have it your own way, mother-fuckers! l want to say something for the... NEWS! l recently saw on TV... Did you know, wretched girl, that the Serbs are the oldest nation? When the Kraut and English and American, 600 years ago, were eating pork with their fucking hands, we had this, and we'd gallantly... pick! At the Serbian court we ate with a fork and the Kraut with... his damn fingers! Serbs... the oldest nation! lt was this fork that drove us in here. lnto a cave. Listen carefully! You have no way out! Come out and surrender and you'll stay alive! There's another 'honest' man. l, Captain Mislimovic, guarantee your lives. Captain Muslimovic? lf you remember, we were in the barracks together. Sergeant Maksimovic, now captain. Remember? l see we both got promoted, Captain! Shame on you, Captain! How many burned villages will get you another stripe? Come on out, you deserter! You betrayed me! Say, Gvozden, who's that? -My brother-in-law. Good morning, boys! -Doctor, how's Speedy? Who? -How's Speedy? Boys, the doctor can't remember all of you! Say, Doctor... do you remember that Muslim over there? He sure has rosy cheeks. Son, our oath obliges us. -l bet it does, tadpole. Excuse me? -Listen carefully! lf Speedy doesn't make it, that one won't either! l'm not to blame, young man. You and he are the same to me. You're both screwed up and you're in a foreign country, so you might choose your words. l wish you a speedy recovery! Doctor, it's a matter of cultural differences! Here's our benefactor! Everything for our brave boys! Pass these around. Want 'Brut' or 'Kouros'? Catch, pal! You flinched, here it is on the floor! Nurse, he dropped his present. You'll pick it up when you get better! Doctor, here's a small present for you. Take care of our boys! -Sloba, we're caring for them like our very own! -They are the future of Serbia! ln 1 991 the Croats attacked, one day soon the Serbs will beat them back! Happy New Year, heroes! Milan, that frigging doctor's not to blame. He might have been just like you if they'd butchered his mother. lnstead, she's walking around Belgrade now, and he was lucky enough to stay the same refined frigging doctor. We can only envy him! You and l and that kid over there can only envy him! Mustafa... Sulejman... l lost my little Muslim friend, lbro. God, it would be easier if she wasn't here. She reminds me of what l'll miss when a bullet hits me. l couldn't bang her for a barrel of beer. What about a glass of water? l'd stick it to her and you, and even to crazy Fork. Admir... Nazim... -Near my house in Banja Luka is a fountain. lt has the coldest water. That's all l think about. l can picture every single stone in it. Stop the bullshit, Professor. Don't remind me of the time l stole a tank truck of beer at the October Fest in Munich. l got down under it and drank it dry in three days. Captain, tell them, we said whoever talks about water has to kneel on cartridges! Go on, fatty, kneel. lt's a mess, totally screwed up. But l'll fix it, everything can be fixed, right? What good will it do if you get it to work? Sorry, just mouthing off. When l was a kid, l thought little people lived under the hood and made the car work. Man, l've seen them with my own eyes. Do you think we'll make it out of here alive? Hold this. l got you into this shit, l'll get you out of it, if it's the last thing l do! Understand? Safet... ldris... Cow! -That's not really a Muslim name. Come kitty, kitty! We've got to guess her name! Lulabelle, Mary... Maybe it's Muslims'. -Enver! That's a bull's name, idiot! Barbie! Barbie! ! ! No milk today, dear Chetniks... Anyway, my mother put beer in my bottle. ls that 1 :0 for us, or did it hit the goalpost? l'm trying to force myself to feel sorry for the poor guy, but it won't work! We've gone to hell... it won't work! Keep on trying, Professor, it might come. ls it worth living when a man starts feeling like that? Whose team were you for before the war? Mostar's or Sarajevo's? -l'm not into soccer. You just get better, so they don't even the score. And l'll try to make the winning goal. Collecting liquid for the radiator? Great idea. Who's next? Thanks, l had a beer five days ago and that'll do. Damn, you peed all over the bottle we have to drink from. lf you want to refresh yourself, you take the best! Coca Cola, it's the real thing! Great 'bouquet', home-made? Let me cross myself. Have some. Have some, it's sugar-free. l mean, diet Coke! She loves it, let's export it! Now you're one of ours. lf a Muslim comes, just boom-boom. Try it, imagine a Muslim... Muslims! ! What's up, little Chetnik? lsn't your mouth dry? Of course not, we got spring water in the tunnel! Where did you get it from? From a mobile fountain! -What's that, buddy? What l used to refresh your old lady with. Professor, you're some sophisticated comedian. Well, Chetniks, soon you'll be eating shit! We didn't come here to insult each other! Hey, up there, know the one about the Muslim girl taking a monkey for a walk in Sarajevo? Come on, Chetnik, go for it! -People asked her where she got it. She said: from UN forces. They said, well, why didn't you have an abortion? One Muslim girl, took a monkey, Chita... Thanks, thanks... One more, please! -Thanks, you're a wanderfull audience! The blond Muslim girl woke up under a cow and looked at the udder and said, Serbs, you're still here... You're still here! You're still here... Watch the birdie! Fuck, you killed my audience! lt's wartime, buddy, we're short on credit. Here's something until tomorrow. From my dead father. A gold tick-tock! ls that from a scout brigade? -He got it from the army. Give it here! That's why we'll lose the war. 30 years of service for a snort of dope! That's not right at all! Doctor, what if l...? You can't shoot up here! Kids play here! OK, buy a ticket! ! Are you still late? -No, l got it this morning! Great! -Why didn't you say so? When it started, l was like born again! Damn, what should we do with this walkman? He won't be needing it anymore. lnternal bleeding. Too bad, he was a sweety. Kill the bloody Croats! Zagreb, here we come! Fuck off, zombie! Thanks, boys, thanks! Let's hear it! Through the forests and mountains of our glorious land, Partizan detachments carry the splendor of battle! That's great you got the 'big M'. All you needed was a baby in the middle of this mess! l'm stuffed up with this tunnel. Lisa, let's do it like Romeo and J uliette and they can film it for a 'soap', eh? Here, take some, this'll make you go woof woof. Dear Chetniks, we have a great program for you: The songs of your youth and ours. l used to love that song. l still do. Hurry up, the bell's gonna ring. Wait, look, 'Rocky ll'! -Look, they're screwing. Quiet, learn something. -lt's gonna ring. Don't worry, ma'am, it's the long recess. Hurry, the bell! -The postman always rings twice. Here it comes, air mail! -No, send it by ship! We inerrupt this program for a special announcement from the Central Committee: Comrade Tito is dead... Today, May 4, 1 980, at 1 5:05, in Ljubljana, the heart stopped beating of the great son of our nationalities and minorities... Why don't you cry? How will we live without our Comrade Tito? l don't know. You cry first. l can't. Muslims, are any of you whores free for a slow dance? Velja, don't fall for that trick, they'll shoot! Who cares, l lost my virginity while this song was playing. Travolta, they'll kill you! Naw... Damned fool! Tonight, if she's listening, let her hear the pain in the song l'm singing for her ears alone, let her carry with her always in her heart, the life she threw away... What's wrong, you bums, can't you do any better? These legs have jumped from the second floor of the Hamburg Volksbank! Now, that's better. Say, Captain, how'd l dance? What'd you do, Travolta? l'm too emotional. That song got to me, it really hit me. We continue with our 'Listeners' requests', Here's hoping that the Chetnik pig recovers soon. And here's our shared Hymn: Hey Slovenes, the spirit of our ancestors still lives... Now you've got to stand up, that's the custom! And now since we've had our fun, we're sending you a broad for your enjoyment! Here comes a sex bomb! Go to your own kind and show them your love bites! She must be full of explosives! What shell we do? Tell them what gentlemen we are! Hello, Chetniks, ladies' choice! Why her? She can barely walk, she must be full of explosives! And what if she isn't? -We'll look like chickens! Stop! Mirjana... please stop, l beg you! Stop there! Lady, stop, please! Fuck, ma'am, stop! Come over here! Chill out, woman! l can't, she's my teacher! Come to me, baby, come explode on me. Come on, sweetie! l can't! Come to Uncle Velja, l'll give you some candy. J ust two more steps! Someone has to! Milan, please. What a damned life. Watch the birdie! -Wait. One, two, three, four... Samir, l'll scalp you like a Sitting Bull! Tighten up your ranks, they can't fit in! Twelve, thirteen... Color won't wait! -l have two 'lost-in-action'! What are you doing? -Banging each other. First he'll do it to me, then l'll do it to him! What? Get up! -Teacher, you're against brotherhood and unity. Come along children, picture time! ldiots, you would've let that woman kill us. Well, you won't! NO! lt's all right, Fork. Take it easy. You orthodox dogs, we send you a pussy and you kill her! We don't know what else to do to amuse you! You really disappointed me. She didn't explode, damn us. As soon as l get out l'll light a candle for her. And for Laza. -l didn't have the guts, no one did. You were the bravest. l'm going home. l've had enough. That Fork's got the brilliant idea. l'm going home, bro'. That's it. l'm going home. Enough's enough. Well, l'll be off! -Yap, closing up time. l'm off! Muslims... we're closing the bar. No more free drinks. Captain, do you think it's better to shoot in the head or the heart? -Get off my back! l will... Milan, what do you think, eh? Don't ask me. You figure it out, Velja. Hey, who's going to help me choose! Well... They're gone. Where're you off to, little Chetnik? l'm going home. -Have a nice trip, pilgrim! Look at this. This is General's from World War l. lt's even got his phone number in the memory, but don't tell anyone. Now this here is... Brother-in-law! ls that you? What are you doing here? -l've come along to make sure you don't bungle things and die. l don't want my sister wasting money on widow's weeds! Let's go! Buddy, come over here. l can sense the Serbian hero in you. God be with you! And with you! God save the Serbs! lt's showtime, folks! Yo, bro'! The man's gone. They're still here! -This hand's a dud. They'll shoot again. l'll wait for the next deal. You don't have to translate on that shitty American any more. She understood by herself, but l'll be sorry, if she doesn't write her story... if there is a story. And l've got what to say. l walked to Comrade Tito's funeral 350 kilometers on foot. lt was on the News. You find that funny? Well, it is funny. He was a smart bastard, Comrade Tito. He lied a lot... but we all loved him. 350 kilometers on foot. l was younger then. That was just a stroll walk for me. Well, kids, it's time to go. There's no reason to wait. The machine's as good as new. Come, have some coffee! -l'm not supposed to! Come on, you know how much we like soldiers. Only gays are left in Belgrade! -l shouldn't. Come on! -These guys aren't going anywhere! Let's dance! Damn helmet. l stuck it over here sometime last week! Where are you?... Warmer, hotter! Anyone got some bullets to spare, l'll give them back. Milan, give this to my mother. lf anyone gets out of this shit, it'll be you! Cut the bull, please! -l've got a hunch, buddy! Here you are, l found you! No hard feelings, guys, a hunch! Stop the bullshit, we're going to carry your fat carcass and find you a nurse with godzilla tits! Now l'm ready. When you come to my funeral and see the miles of babes crying for me, you'll know who Uncle Velja was... His mother's fool! ...l gave candy to each of them! Well, l won't keep you any longer. Drop by to see me when you've got time! Real Hollywood slobbering! This is worth living for. At least a while longer! l was just kidding. So long! Jesus Christ, you really screwed me up! You, bastard! Uncle Velja has a present for everybody! Mom, don't look at me like that. Everything's been paid for, l just lost the receipts! Come here! J ust look at it! The papers are clean, they were laundered with my jeans! Take me for a spin! -l don't have a license! Take mine! -Velja, why didn't you write? Why should l, when you knew l was fine! Hey, did you finish your freshman year? Sophomore, bro! -So, soon you'll be an archeologist! But don't dig me up when l kick the bucket! Don't worry, we just dig up works of art. What am l, pulp, you motherfucker?! Sorry, Mama! Here, punish yourself. God, you've gotten stronger! That's the neighbor, she must have seen you arive. ls the student, Milos Kozic, there? -Yes. Now he's had it! Healthy, and ignored his call-up twice, motherfucker... Sorry, ma'am. He's got to come with us! Archeologist, we've got bones too, but we bury them! -Yap! You came at the right time, l just got back from a trip. A little bit of fresh air will do me good. Mom! Kid! Take this, careful how you drive. The seat goes down on the side, and her legs go up. Sorry, Mom! Let's get moving! The sooner l leave, the sooner l'll be back! You'll see how great it is in the army. Jesus, how you conned me, bastard, damn you! Chetniks!

Good evening, Serbs. And good night! -Halil! Where were you yesterday at the soccer game? We beat those guys from Kurtalici 5: 1 ! l had to go get circumcised! -Can you pee now? Of course, why not! -Let me see! Take a good look. Whoever has a longer one will get a telegram! The girls will die laughing when they see you! Who goes first? You! Third and fifth odd! Luck's on your side, Milan! Your turn! -First and fifth odd! How much is seven and six? Ask the teacher! l'll take the truck! You take them out on the other side! Wait, where are you going? Wait! l won't let you! Come back! Nurse! That's our artillery! Gvozden, what are you doing? Take them out the other side! Let's not kiss good-bye! With Marshall Tito, our heroic son, even the devil will admit we have won, with heads held high, walk with a grin, and keep our hand firmly in a fist! Now you'll meet my brother-in-law. Here we come, bro'! Let's go! l'll carry him! Those are our boys, they'll bury us in here! l won't let you! Nurse! Do you give up? -No! What do you mean, no? -No! Here comes the Serbian cavalry! Milan! So you went into the tunnel? l did! Why'd you burn our garage? -Why'd you slaughter my mother? l didn't slaughter anyone! l didn't set the garage on fire, either! Who did? That Ogre from the tunnel, maybe? Did the Ogre do it, Milan? Do it. You do it. Do you give up? -No way! One of us has got to! -You do it! -No, you do it! What's up, Lauda! You do it.
