[wind howling] [scary music] [somber music] [suspenseful music] Here we are. [birds chirping] [car door closing] What do you think? I know it's not much, but it's got a good foundation. - If I do a bit of work to it - It's perfect. It's exactly how I pictured it. Go ahead, look around. I'll bring Sam in. [door squeaking] I love it, Frank. It's perfect. I think Sam likes it. - Fit for a king I think. - Yeah it is. - It's too much. - No, not at all. I wish I could have done more to the house, but with you and Sam and the book. It's beautiful, thank you. Hold still a sec. What's this for? Just a thank you for being so understanding. You don't have to get me anything. I support you no matter what. Well it's also for being a mom. I know I haven't been very supportive of this move, but I know in my heart it's best for all of us. [baby talking] [eerie tone] I think I'm gonna try and get some sleep. Can I get you anything? No I think I just need some rest. Alright, I'm gonna wash up here and unload a few more things still. Okay. Don't stay up too late. I won't. I'm getting pretty tired. Okay, goodnight. Sleep well. [mechanical sound] Shouldn't you be writing? Yes, but I need to get the house somewhat liveable. We came here for a better life, I want the house to reflect that. I know, but you're gonna need to get something on paper. Please, don't start with me. I'm not starting with you, I just want what's best for you. Well then what's best for me is to get the house ready to live in. Okay, so can you promise me that you're gonna write something soon? I will, I will, I promise. [baby crying] You wanna go? I don't think I'm ready. Sure you are, you've always been ready. I thought we agreed you aren't gonna push me. You're right. I just thought that... Yeah well you thought wrong. Hey. You awake? Yeah. Hey I got an idea. Why don't we go outside for a walk in the woods? Bring Sam with us. The sun is about to set, it'll be beautiful. Oh that sounds wonderful. But I'm really tired. I think I'm just gonna rest, okay? Okay. Okay. Well I'm gonna go for a walk. [banging sound] Hello? Anyone there? Hello? I'm Frank Brooksfield. I just moved in next door and I thought I would come by. Looks like there's a storm coming. - We could be in for some rough-- - What do you want? Yeah, like I said, I just moved in next door - and I just wanted to come by-- - Go away! Look, I'm sorry if I scared you. - I didn't-- - My husband's in the house, you know. Yeah, Well I knocked. Nobody answered the door. Didn't you hear me? Okay, okay. Look, I'm sorry if I frightened you, I... I said get out of here! Okay. [insects buzzing] [baby crying] [heartbeat sound] [rustling sound] [thunder] [distant thunder] [door squeaking] Sam? Sam? Sam... Sam, no. [sad music] [sobbing] [baby coughing] Hey. Julie! [thunder] [baby crying] Julie? Julie? [squeaking sound] Okay. [eerie music] He wasn't breathing Frank. I swear, he wasn't breathing. It's okay now. No it's my fault, I couldn't pick him up. I couldn't touch him, I couldn't check to see if Julie! It's okay, he's fine now. You don't understand. I almost destroyed our family. I only came back because I hadn't touched him yet. Not like a mother should. And I didn't want to leave without having felt that with him, having him know my touch. Julie, everybody is fine, it's alright. What happened? Frank, stop it! I can't handle this right now. What? You! What do you mean? Just can you give me some space, please! I don't know what you're talking about, what... Frank, just stop, please! [sobbing] I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I couldn't hold my baby. Remember what the doctor said. When you're ready it'll happen naturally. But it's not happening. It will Julie. I promise it will. I have to get some flashlights. You okay? Yeah. Are you seeing him to sleep? I'll be right back. [insect buzzing] [baby crying] [rattling sound] Frank, no! We'll go slow, ok? You just need to get used to having him around. I'm his mother, I shouldn't have to get No should' s, okay? Yeah. Thank you. You're welcome. Oh sorry, did I wake you? No. I put Sam in the nursery, he's out cold. I'm gonna go check and see if the neighbor's phone is working. Will you be okay by yourself for a bit? I'll be as quick as I can. [chicken sounds] [door squeaking] Are you alright? Sorry if I startled you again. Is your power out? No. So is your phone still working then? I guess. You think I can use it? The storm blew down the power line to my house, I have no power. They said the storm blew down some pretty big trees. The road to the ferry is blocked, could be closed for the entire week. Seems I'm out of luck, huh? Does this sort of thing happen often around here? I suppose. Seems as though we're stuck out here. I suppose. Well thank you for letting me use your phone. Can I ask a question? Go on. How long have you lived down here? All my life. Here, on this property? Frank. Helen. Well thank you for letting me use... ...phone. Julie? Frank! - What's the matter? - Can you check on Sam please? Sure. Why, what's the matter? He was crying really hard, and then I was too afraid to check on him and then he just stopped and he's been quiet ever since. And you still haven't checked him? I'm sorry. You're okay. Yeah. I'm gonna be able to hear you. [baby sounds] Here, that makes the difference. What? Remember when your mom came to visit when we first got the monitor? She overheard you saying how annoying she was. I thought she was gonna kill me. My God she was mad. What? It's great to hear you laugh. [banging sound] [scrambled noise] [baby sounds] [scary music] Frank? Does it have to be so loud? I'll go downstairs. I can't sleep. [suspenseful music] [creaking sound] [baby crying] [crying continues] [ominous sound] [scary music] Where were you? I was outside. I thought I heard something. What, like a burglar? No not a burglar. I don't know. What's going on? Nothing, it was just my imagination. Why do you have that knife? It's nothing, I just thought I heard something. Are you sure? Yeah, I probably just need to get some sleep. [door squeaking] [heartbeat sound] Did he feed? Yeah, lots. How long before it started? Right away. I think he hates me. No he doesn't. Yes he does, I'm sure of it. Well, he doesn't. - Here. - Jesus, Frank! I'm sorry, I keep trying to push you and you're not ready. No you're right. I'm just afraid. Don't worry, it'll happen naturally. [scary music] [baby cry] Julie, Julie! Wake up, wake up! Sam isn't in the bed! What? Get the flashlight. Check under the covers. Careful! Where is he? Where is he? Oh, wait, Frank, you put him in the nursery. What? Last night, when we went to sleep, look. [eerie sound] [scary crescendo] Is that you, baby? Hey. Hey there. Uh, it is you. Oh, I'll get you cleaned up. Here we go. Here we go. [ominous music] Stay there. [baby crying] [scary music] [scary music] [baby crying] It's okay. Daddy's here. Hello? Helen? Hello? Hi, how are you? Fresh milk today? Some. You're gonna make her nervous. Sorry. Yeah, sorry isn't gonna keep her still. Okay. The reason I came was because I was wondering if... ...you might be able to do some babysitting for us. I could pay you of course. And I could help out around here, I could chop some wood, milk the goats. I don't think I can do that chicken in a bag thing. Helen. Pest. Look, I know that we don't know each other well but I'm in quite a jam here my wife, Julie, she's sick. Actually it's more than that, she has something called postpartum depression. And she's having a very tough time right now. I brought us out here so that I could focus on my book. Anyway, it would be a big big help if you could... No! Julie? -Julie? -Yeah? Have you noticed anything strange? What? Crying? Him? No. Julie! Oh, shit. Ahh. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Ah shit. [gasping] Julie your hands. You okay? [sobbing] [somber music] [baby crying] [insects buzzing] Julie! Julie! [scary music] Julie, do you need any laundry done? No! Sam! [music crescendo] Julie? [scary music] Maybe he threw up. It could be bile. That much? It's bile, it must be. He's sick, he's so pale. Julie, this isn't so simple. He's not sick, it's something else. Frank, when was the last time you slept? What are you saying it was me? Well I'm not the one that left him for dead and went running off in the forest in the middle of the night. I know. What was so important that you were just up and leave? I didn't just up and leave, I thought he was dead. My husband was gone. What was I supposed to do? Julie you should have waited. I made a mistake, I know. But that doesn't change what is happening now. I'm his mother, I know what he's feeling and he is sick. I know he is. You just please, you just have to trust me. We have to take him to the hospital. We can't. And even if we could, how is this gonna look to a doctor? Does this look like a capable parent? What are you gonna tell the doctor? That you mistakenly thought your baby was dead? That you tried to kill yourself? That you couldn't bring yourself to touch him? That you still can't? I'm sorry, you're right. As soon as the roads are clear, we'll take him to the doctor, I promise. But until then we have to do this together, okay? Let me help you. Push it higher. Ah, thank you. [scary music] Is that your baby? Yeah, that's Sam. Ah, I don't like babies! What is it Helen? Leave, just leave! Stop coming around here! What are you scared of Helen? Helen! [knocking on door] Go away! Helen let me in! I said go away! Helen please, I just want to talk to you. No! I think something's trying to hurt Sam. Go away please, just go away. Helen, if you know something, I need to know! You know something, don't you? No. Maybe. I don't know, it doesn't make any sense. What? What doesn't make sense? Her. That she tried to hurt your baby, I've only thought about it. Only thought about what? No you don't understand, it's not me, it's her. Who? Helen! What the hell are you talking about? Go away. Helen, Helen please. Please. I'm going crazy here. Helen help me. Please let me in I just need to talk to you. Helen! [footsteps] When I was a little girl, maybe eight, my parents were trying to have another child. My mother, you see all the babies after me was stillborn. My wife and I, our first three children were stillborn. So you've seen them. Who? The stillborn. [scary music] What do you mean, the stillborn? I mean stillborn children. You've seen what they look like. [somber music] Yes. They're not how you would imagine them, they're not how you would want to remember. They're not the peaceful little versions of the living... their faces are frozen in anguish... they're disfigured... and bruised... deformed. He'd given up on my mother, my father. He was sure she was gonna kill this baby too. It was a girl. When she didn't breathe... my dad just stared straight ahead... never said a word. After a moment he picked up the baby, placed it in a sack, picked up his shovel and headed into the forest. My father and I weren't very close. He pretty much stayed clear of me and I was always watching him. I followed him into the forest that night, to see where he was gonna put my sister. And he came to a clearing in the forest... dropped the bag... and began to dig. As he dug, all I could do was staring at that bag sitting on the ground, lifeless. And it happened, the bag moved. Not much, but enough to know that the baby inside was still alive. His hole was dug, he picked up the bag, tossed it in and began to shovel dirt into the hole. I was frozen with fear. My legs wouldn't move. I just sat there as he buried my sister. All I could do was watch. After he left, I just sat there and cried. I did nothing. Just sat and watched. That night, after I went to bed, was when I first heard the cries. I knew it was her. She was screaming at me. She tried to hurt you? Mostly just the crying. I don't know what's happening to your baby but I want nothing to do with it. There you go. Come here, come here. There you go. What did she say? She can't help. What's that? It's a video monitor. Hope it still works. So what are we gonna do? We'll just have to watch until we can get out of here. I don't trust the audio monitor. This way we can see what he's doing. I'm gonna get some batteries. [loud bang] [scary music] What? I thought... I thought I saw... What? Never mind. No you can't do that, not after everything that's been happening. What? I thought I saw something hurting Sam. Who? I don't know. He's fine, go back to bed. Julie. What would you do if something... If something goes wrong, believe me you'll know. Okay, just wanna make sure. Frank . I can take care of him. You know what you can do to turkey, you can brown. Hey, nobody has forgotten you, mummy is just basting. Hey sleepy. You're filthy! We can eat as soon as the turkey browns. What's going on? We're celebrating. Why? Ah, because we have power. Oh, thank God. Honey, where's Sam? Don't do that, that's not funny. [scary music] Oh my God, get him out, get him out! Julie? Julie? Julie? You're hot. So hot, baby. [loud scream] [scary music] Julie? [screaming] Where have you been? Where did you go? I've been looking for you! Why did you run away? I heard something. Honey I need to know that you can do this. I need to know that you can protect him. I can't. Yes you can, Julie. I can't. His life might depend on it! Frank will you listen to me, I can't. [scary music] I don't know what's wrong. Oh my God. I don't understand it... hurt my arm. Did that hurt? No. You're gonna tell me what happened? Can't remember. I just pulled a two inch slipper from your arm and you're gonna tell me you don't know what happened? I fell asleep and then I woke up and I couldn't feel my arm. Maybe I was sleepwalking. What are you doing? [ominous music] Just gonna put Sam in the nursery. No, I can still help take care of him. You need to get some rest. No, no Frank, please. Please don't take him away from me. Get some sleep. No Frank, please. Please don't do this to me, please. [scary music] [gasping] [eerie music] Who are you? Are you Helen's sister? What do you want? Don't hurt my baby, please. Julie, wake up. I saw it. What time is it? It's 5am. Why, what's happening? I saw a ghost. What? Where? In the nursery. When, just now? On the video monitor. It's not a baby. What? I don't know why, I keep hearing a baby crying. Frank, listen to yourself. You're not making any sense. It means Helen isn't telling the truth. Or maybe she is, maybe it's a whole other ghost. Maybe Helen has nothing to do with it. I don't know. Either way, I have to find out. I'm gonna have to talk to Helen, you're gonna have to watch Sam. No you can't just leave us here. I have to! Not when you think there's some kind of ghost in the other room. I don't think he wants to hurt Sam, I think he's trying to do something else. [baby crying] I think he's trying to warn us. Frank, I'm not staying here alone. Okay. I'm gonna get him something warm. You can watch Sam. It's okay, just watch Sam! I'll be right back. I can do it. Okay yes, just come back. I'll be right back. [scary music] [door sound] [loud scream] He's burning up. Oh no. We gotta get out of here now. No. What do you mean, no? It's too late. We gotta take him to the hospital. We can't, the roads are blocked. I'll walk if I have to! We failed him, Frank. We failed him from the very beginning. And every second this goes on, every second we stand by and watch him suffer we're failing him that much more. Let me hold him. [scary music] I'm ready. Frank please, I know it's time. No, I don't think it's a very good idea. I need to touch him, please. I'm ready to touch him. No, you're not ready. You can hold him as soon as we get out of here. You'll have plenty of time to hold him. Give him to me! I'm trying to help him! I'm trying to protect my family, can't you see that Julie? [baby crying] Julie? Frank... [scary music] ...help me. This isn't happening. [wind howling] [scary music] Oh, why are you doing this to me? [screaming] [breathing heavily] [rattling sound] Helen! Helen please help! Helen! Please! Helen! Helen please. You have to take Sam! No, leave me alone! Get away from me! There's too much death out there. Please, you can't stay here. It's not safe. Julie is dying. What? How? It's not your sister. How do you know? Because... because I saw her, she didn't try to hurt Sam. I think she was trying to warn me. But she's tricking you. No, I'm telling you it wasn't your sister. Please just take Sam, please take him. No Frank, you don't understand. You don't understand, this is her, this wind, this is her screaming and clawing at the world, don't you know that? No it's not. The moment I touch your baby is the moment she takes its life. Please, keep him away from me. You were just eight years old, your imagination just played tricks on you, how would you know if it's her? Because she's done it before! I was trying to make things right so I became a midwife. Everything was fine until I helped deliver my first baby. Until I touched him. He died, Frank. They all died. Each one I touched was stillborn. [emotional music] She's cursed me. She won't let me redeem myself. She won't let me feel the joy of giving life, only guilt and sorrow because I stole life. But Sam's alive and Julie is going to die. You can help save a life. Please, please take him. Please. Alright, I'll do it. Go! I'll call for help. Noooo! She killed him. Oh God. [baby crying] She killed him. What are you doing? You're okay. Oh. [scary music] Oh Frank... Oh Frank, you can't see it, can you? What? Frank, your baby is dead. What? Sam's dead, Frank. - What are you talking about? - He's been dead for days... maybe longer. No. It's a trick! No. You said she would try to do this. What did you do to my baby? Frank... Frank, where is your wife? Where's your wife, Frank? You stay away, stay away from her! [distorted voice] Sorry, sorry Frank. As soon as the roads are clear, we'll take him to the doctor, I promise. But until then we have to do this together, okay? [ominous music] Julie your hands. You okay? Who are you? Are you Helen's sister? What do you want? [thunder] Sam! Julie! Julie? [thunder] [scrambled sounds] [scary music] [distant baby crying] [rustling] [sobbing] [ominous music] [gasping] [baby crying]
