A FREE CITY Free City of Gdansk, the great Baltic port. City of commerce and industry. Symbol of global disaster. The turbulent history of Gdansk shaped its location - at the mouth of the Vistula. Hence riches and conflicts. After World War I, attempts were made to solve the problem of Gdansk on the basis of timid, short-sighted caution. Many protocols and commitments were signed. The Polish population was to enjoy cultural and civil liberties. Poland was granted participation in port management, railways, own postal service. The Polish Post and Telegraph Office was located at Heweliusz Square. Good day. Good day. Good day. And what are you doing here, Mr. Barcikowski? I'm healthy now, Chief. Healthy? I can go to the area. Then go home. What will I do at home? You will go to bed. Mr. rest. Excuse me. I forgot to fasten. Germans will say that the Polish postman is unfastened. Thank you gentlemen. Chief... I have a request for Chief. Listen. I would like to change the area. The Lord has a good area, few floors. This is not about floors. This is the scoundrel! It destroys the heart more than the floors. Are you afraid Well... I'm not young anymore. I don't have these forces anymore. What will I do if three of me fail? Barcikowski, a strong peasant, he couldn't do it. I don't want to lose health like him. It's seven o'clock. Let's go to the area. I will think about this matter. Good morning, Mr. Rajca! AND! Good day. You would give it a rest. You are not afraid to wear a uniform, I can. An old peasant is different, and what else such a flair like you. You saw how your father arranged it. But Dad also gave them an impression. And they never attacked you? Don't talk so much. If they attack, you would defend yourself, right? Goodbye! Hi. Good morning! Good morning, Mr. Schmolde. Heil Hitler! Beer! - Hello, Elza! - Hi! Mum, Rudi will take me to the market. Good morning, Elza. Good day. Father in service My husband in service. Is there something for us? Can you join us? Would you like a coffee? No thank you, Mrs. Hermanowa. I'm on duty, I don't have time. If you meet my husband, don't tell him anything that you saw Elza with this Nowak. Staszek doesn't even let her talk to him. They've known each other since they were little. What German is he there? They gave him to a German school, because old Nowak was afraid that he would be thrown out of work. You have to understand man. No wonder for my husband. You know how it is today. Rudi is a good boy. Elzie said if we were in trouble, it would help us. What can he help? An ordinary chauffeur. His uncle is a police officer. Mother is German, but she is also an honest woman. He's all good... Goodbye, Mrs. Hermanowa. Wisniewski! One mailbox? No three. Take. Trudka! Where's grandfather? Glass window. Call him and let him open the basement. Be careful, be careful. To the basement. Carefully. Are these crates going to the basement? Yes. Give me the dumpling. I will open it for you. For me, service is heavier than on board. You'll find out for yourself. No, Janek, I'm just warning you. I have to go. Come home tonight. Nothing but I'm busy. Nothing nothing. Goodbye. If man were a sailor or an uhl... It is known behind the maid's uniform with a rope. The Lord has been talking to himself for some time. If there is no one to hear me, I speak to myself. Because you always start something and don't finish it. Gdansk 1. Yes, a link Mr. Konrad! The Teletype parts came. How much? Three chests. Fine. Did you hide They're locked up in the basement. This one here again. What do you care - What is this one? - Konrad, sport instructor. I know that. But what does he do here? Don't be so curious, woman. See your work. "Free City Authorities Provide Polish Customs Inspectors freedom to perform their duties under existing contracts". When they hit the table with their fists, they hide their corners. I'm afraid not for long. The Lord is a pessimist. I rather am of good cheer. Have you heard of the Anglo-French military mission? Apparently they are to come to Gdansk. I heard. After Smiglego's speech, the situation is clear. And if the war is global. You know... Our Iistonosze... are afraid to walk around the city. And today an old, tried postman asked me to change the area. People do not endure nervously. And which postman is it? Councilman. The thing is, there is no longer a quiet area in the city. Just show up in uniform... - Good morning. - Good morning. Honey, I've asked so many times not to come in here during office hours. I saw that Mr. Konrad came, so I wanted to ask wouldn't you stay for dinner. I can not. Maybe... Thank you. I come back to Gdynia after training. I really regret it. Great weather. I would like it to normalize by September. I promised my wife and little trip to the mountains. I hope they will give me human life. If I had such plans, then... So what? I just wouldn't come here in your place. I don't come here for pleasure. Now, already... But why just mail? And why do they beat your postmen? The Lord here represents Poland with his post. Anyway, you know better than me. Of course. Of course. I know that you have to be ready for everything and that you are needed here. You just see as an old postman... I just can't understand it that someone would dare to attack the post office. Post office, ladies, institution established for agreement and consent. Lord, in what times do we live? Time that we did not choose, Mr. Kowalski. What are you doing here? My landlady's kids are coming back tomorrow from colonies from Poland. She asked me to check trains. You got scared until you paled. And... I got scared. Whom? You also lost something. Bastard... damn. Every day yes. They are no longer in the barracks. They sleep after school. Where does it get from? From Pi≈Çy and Hamburg, from Prussia. More and more of them, and less and less of us. Somehow it will be, brother. Come and have a beer. I had a nasty day. Two beers. Actually, women and children should leave, if they have families in Poland. They urge us in the management. Mine even wants to go. To my sister to Grudziadza. And Elza is not again. Because he has a peasant here. Do you think about this Nowak? I saw them in the morning. They were talking on the street. Nothing special. Nothing special? This is the swab - this Nowak! A sutured shoe! Here? - Would you like a beer? - Ice cream, big. What should you give? Big ice cream and beer. There is nowhere to go in your Gdansk. I wanted to invite you to my place but I was afraid you'd refuse, like I used to. I can't do that. Mama, tea, flowers on the table... I don't want you to think I'm catching you. I understand that freedom is the most important thing for you. Sailor. That's why I haven't tried it a second time. Mum... "This looks serious." Do you think this is not a serious matter? Serious for me, for you... Whatever it is to you, for me it is the most serious in my life. - When will you come to Gdynia? - I have three days of overdue leave. I promised my aunt I would visit her. Today is the seventeenth. Tomorrow we are going on a cruise to Stockholm, coming back we will stay in Gdansk, around the next week. Don't come before twenty-six. - And when permanently? - We'll see. - Good morning, Zosia. - Good morning. Was something important? No, there is one Warsaw ordered for the police station. How you look pretty today. I know who. Nothing will hide from me. - Good morning. - Good morning. Hello Warsaw! - Bye, Ireczko. - Bye. Hello Warsaw! - Well. I am waiting. - I am waiting too. - For what? - Good morning. Good day. - Apparently you're going on vacation. - I'm going, I'm going. In nine days, from the first of September. It will be boring without you. We could go to Oliwy together on Sunday. There are the largest church organs in Europe! 20 thousand pipes! Take Mr. Zosia. I am not interested in church music. - Bad girl. - Yes. Don't be interested in me. Goodbye Mr. Pluske. I hope to see you soon in more pleasant circumstances. The day after tomorrow this blue dress is to be ready. Send it to me. And don't forget about money. It doesn't overflow mother. Write immediately upon arrival. Remember I will be waiting. However, I am looking forward to this Warsaw. It's always a change. Will write. Of course I will write. In Kolibkach, lightning burned the barn. Probably yesterday, when the storm was over. - She went. - What? Kowalska went. To Warsaw. I don't think he'll be back. All women should leave. You too, Erna. I? And who will cook? Who will clean? - Who will take care of Trudka? - You should go with Trudka. The head said that every one has the right to send his family to Poland. These are the times now. For you, what the warden says is holy. Where will I be with my child in foreign corners? Not such times, not such experiences. No! Do you hear? I won't move from here. I didn't ask you to take my area. - You didn't need to ask. - But you see that I came. - I have to go. - Give me the bag! I see you are well. Only in your eyes are you poor. Do not make me angry. What this I hear you divide the regions between you. Don't be afraid. Plichta will not shame you. But why should he go to my area, how can I? Not yet. I don't want you to frighten our clients. In the meantime, you will help in the packing room. Good morning! Moment. Couldn't you soak your feet in your room? I need to have hot water on hand. You think it's nice to dance around like that. Soon, Mrs. Klimkowa. I will buy a house, it will be comfortable for us all. You'd better buy a new quilt. There will be a house, it will do the rest. What do you think? I already have nearly two thousand on the booklet. What's going on there? Jurek, give her a break! If the father comes, he will give you a belt. Jurek, come here! Here, man. France, Belgium... I already have it. Thank you. At a summer camp in Zakopane, one boy promised me to send only Polish. Please choose. - Mr. neighbour has come. - This one always in time. No, it will come later. Jurek! Close his face! Good night. Good night, Mrs. Klimkowa. No! I'm dizzy! Are you ashamed of me I don't want anyone to hurt you. I'm not afraid of anything with you. You will protect me, right? And your name is Nowak. And what of this? Rudi, let's dance! Your old man is on duty today, isn't he? My old ones also left. I'm home alone. I have cool records. Well? Where have you been? - Where have you been? - I was only in the cinema. - And then I went dancing. - With who? - With a friend. - With whom? - With Nowak. - Whore! Rudi is my fianc√©! I'll get this fianc√© out of your head! - Dad! - Let go! What are you beating a girl for? Let go! You busted a whore! Still coming out! - Listen... - Be quiet! I know everything! Who ordered Warsaw? This is a letter to Germany. They should know that through us letters go only to Poland and Poland. They were wrong. Return German Post. Good day. I see that this time for longer. Well we will see. You know about the arrival of "Schleswig-Holstein". This is a school ship. School. It has 220 mm guns. Exactly. For now, the situation is not good. Henderson's visit to Berlin ended in a flop. Will I still need you? Let Spider prepare a room for Mr. Konrad. Brother! You have to frame it. You will have something to show off to your grandchildren. These are hell! You made us an ad, brother. Brick promotion! They ambushed me. One chatted with the camera, the other cut the strap. - Don't tell me. You've probably drunk yourself. - I love God. Give him a break. It can happen to anyone. Yes, they wrote well... - For beer. - No, guys, I have to go. I have to do something at the post office. We know what he has at the post office. - But one beer! - Come on. There is a free place. Four beers. It smells here. - Do you have floors? - Keep calm. You're welcome. Good beer. - What are they saying? - The dog is barking, the wind is carrying. - Who doesn't like it there? - Come on. - Let's go from here. - Not now, brother. What is going on? - Heil Hitler! - Heil Hitler! Mrs. Klimkowa, what happened? Those black men came with some paper and they immediately began to leave. Where's the husband? Where am I going to share with the kids now? And for what? And this one is lost somewhere! Pam Khmkowa... Look, Jurek, what I brought you. Mum, father is coming! You are finally here! Mr. Rajca also has to look for something. I couldn't find the car. Don't worry about me. I will manage somehow. Mr. Rajca, help me with this wardrobe! How thick is the wall separating us from the Arbeitsamt? Two bricks. Two bricks. You would need to strengthen the night emergency. Emergency call - just like during Klaipeda's hecy. If something happens, we are defenceless. The idea is not to be surprised before help arrives. Don't delude yourself that they will leave your mail alone. Maybe it will all bones. - Good evening. - Good evening. I'll see you later. Thank you, Trudka. - How do you know my name? - I know, I know everything. - I even know how old you are. - How many? - Eight. - Not true, almost nine. It wasn't much wrong. Just about "almost". - Who is this pretty lady? - And this is my wife. - Do you like it? - Uhm. - And you have children? - A son, big like you. - And we come here? - Here? Coming. He will have fun together. - Johnny! - Lord bastard! We ask! We are asking you too! - "Lord bastard"? - They're making fun of me. I didn't want to tell you right away, but in the spring I am to become a bosun. We will take a new apartment with a sea view. You drop your mail, you don't have to work. What should I do? Waiting for months for you? You will bring mum. You will be a nanny. You jump like a goat. When you sit all day at the desk, you can forget that you have legs. And such legs! Move to Gdynia. If you necessarily want to work, you'll find something here. Anyway, there is nothing to talk about. If we are to be together, then... If you had pronounced from the first... September, October, November. The wedding could be a holiday. Anti-aircraft exercises. What's wrong? Do not say anything. I would like to believe it all. Mr. Konrad. Yes? I'm looking for you all over the post office. It wasn't until Spider told me that you were here. What's up? No, nothing. Only today is Sunday, there is no one to open their mouths to. Maybe we would go for a walk? You know... You would have to cut these bushes here. Why? They cover the fire field. It is impossible. What is impossible? That it would happen. Everything is possible. Germany is secretly mobilizing. They focus troops on our border. Everything is possible. What can we do? Withstand 12 hours. Just. It's suicide. You see, there is a difference between suicide and defence. Anyway, we have nothing to wander about. We will do what is required of us. Well? What, Chief? We will go for this walk. It's not going to happen. You won't take any women for a sigh. With women, brother, it's just energy and laughter. The peasant must have spawn. That much? I won't take it at once. - The spring sits down. - The spring sits down... Have you heard, Mr. Broniu? Right! Mr. Bronek! Well, tomorrow, quarters! - For what? - For what? For who! Either you respect your patron or you don't. No! Not allowed! Who let you in here? Not allowed! You are not allowed here! They came by force! Please leave the mailing area immediately. I don't care about your orders. Here is the territory of the Polish state. Please leave. Don't stop work. Please get off. The train still doesn't go. - How is this not going? - Communication with Gdansk interrupted. - What happened? Accident? - It's a scandal! I will write a complaint! I can not help it. - I advise you to turn back. - What's happening? Trains do not walk. You haven't seen the mobilization announcements? There can be a shooting at any time. Let me go. I have to go back to Gdansk. I work at the post office, I have night duty. I don't stop you, I have no right but it can be fun there. When I have to come back! What we going to do now? - Please. - I have to. I thought you were a man and you were the same swab as others! You are all one! Where is it, man? To you. And I to you. They threw us out of the apartment. I lived with a German for a few days, but he is afraid. I thought maybe you were... Arrested railwaymen. I went out looking for accommodation. Maybe at the post office? - You don't like it? - I'm not hungry. You must eat before duty. Where's Bogu≈õ? You were fighting again? Do you want to go to the hospital like a father? They attacked him, he defended himself. - You don't scare the boy with the hospital. - Still where they beat in the street. Wash yourself - You don't eat? - I do not want to. You'll be hungry all night. He always has enough, and now he does not want to eat. It's always safer to buy. They will spend the night. Won't they throw me out? Do not be afraid. Your own. It's you, Rajca. This is your peasant. Railwayman. We have nowhere to sleep. Then go to the old one. Poland is not alone. At her side stand two European powers - England and France. These powers, like Poland, they have enough insane policy of sixth threats and fights. Statement by Prime Minister Chamberlain in the House of Commons caused great nervousness... Yes? Chief, I'm here with a friend, a railwayman. We have nowhere to sleep today, maybe... Put them in my room. Let them get blankets from Spider. The Lord was replacing me. I'm so sorry, sir. They suspended communication with Gdansk. I thought I wouldn't get at all. I was pleased to do something for you. You're already on holiday. - Only from tomorrow, i.e. in an hour. - Thank you, sir. Good bye lady. We'll meet in a month. I hope. Goodbye. Don't be angry that I teased you. Goodbye Mr. December. Let me out. Are you coming now? You are right. Why turn your neck? - I have a vacation from tomorrow. - You went just in time. She leaves Kobita alone on duty and spits. - Do you think anything could be at night? - It may be, it may not be. Mr. Kozubek, are you coming or not? Warsaw? Warsaw? Hello Warsaw! I am waiting. Stop fooling around. Colleagues, we talked with Warsaw. Italy made an offer for brokering. In Warsaw, this is assessed as an announcement of a change in Hitler's policy. It can be assumed that the night will be calm. Who is not on duty now, can sleep. - Do you still clean at this time? - I have to wash the floor in the toilet. The end of work cannot be seen. - How's Trudka doing? - Sleeps. But you turned her head. You definitely want to marry your son. Personally, I don't mind. - Good night, Mrs. Spider. - Good night. 177... 178... 179. That would be for the morning ambulance. If he goes. How will it not go? The railwaymen said that they had stopped all traffic. 170 packages left. How will tomorrow not go again? Give back to people For now we will stop. We'll see, maybe something will be explained. What is going on here? How do I know? Bury the papers, go to sleep. Don't undress. Shit knows what can happen. Please. Mr. Konrad, come listen to me. Clink. - Where? Who? - Into the wall from Arbeitsamt. - I hear nothing. - Something was scratching, something was scratching... Nic. If there was something, call me. RADIO: It's 23.59 now. By ending our program today, We remind you to ground the antenna and we wish everyone a good night. I will grow bees in the garden. Two, or maybe three trunks. This is a very interesting job. And you know, brother, there is nothing healthier than honey. For the heart, for rheumatism. Even if such a bee eats you, it's healthy. Staszek, are you sleeping? We have peace. No, nothing. The chief is certainly asleep. How about you? Hello, police station! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello, police station! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello, police station! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! - What happened? - I have to inform the warden. - What happened? - Telephone connection interrupted. Wake him up. Tell him I'm in the basement with my people. Please go. I am the post defence commander. Barcikowski We're going downstairs. Plichta, we're going downstairs. Grandma! - Grandma! - Do not be afraid. Don't be afraid, Trudka. Handing out weapons to everyone! Come on, come on. What's up, assistant? Germany! Here! Machine-gun position! Can you shoot? To the basement, to the windows! Miss Irko! Miss Irko! Kozubek, come for wardrobes! You have to barricade! Machine-gun from the front! You can see them better here! shots But you gave him... SHARED Come here! Assistant, files are up! You will go with the grandpa to the basement. They won't do anything to you there. Grandma! Lives? - Where's Konrad? - killed! Well... You don't have to. We will have more of these. Cry Trudka Attention! They're shooting from the roof! Good volunteer shooter! I'll go, sir! Preferably from the attic. They backed away. Chief, what is this? Why is it so quiet? How's down there? They tried from the yard. But we chased them away. I'll help. No, leave me alone. Ammunition! Whoever is missing let him take. Watch the windows. I brought you coffee. Chief, is this a war? Is it only here in Gdansk? I'll escort him, Chief. It's probably "Schleswig-Holstein". I didn't say goodbye to them. Good woman, but like a woman she started shouting at him for fear of him. And damn she took me. It will end, you will chase. End up? But how will it end? Where's the warden? He stood. I shot him yesterday. He was already at the gate, how I hit him from above. They have enough. Just look how ours will be here. One, two, three, four, five... Employees of Poczty Polska! Surrender! Your resistance is hopeless. If you don't give up, you'll be destroyed! Employees of Poczty Polska! Surrender! Your resistance is hopeless! If you don't give up, you'll be destroyed! We know what awaits us if we give up. The war is over for Gdansk. They won't leave us alone. Our divisions will be in Gdansk any time! We have no choice. We will work around the positions. Employees of Poczty Polska! Surrender! If you don't give up you will be destroyed! Employees of Poczty Polska! Surrender! Your resistance is hopeless! If you don't give up, you'll be destroyed! Ride! Fire! Down! Everyone down! Barcikowski! The machine-gun to the basement! Everyone to the basement! Ammunition! Let's go! Miss Irko! Irka! Irka! Irka! There are still people there! Help! Rescue... Ammunition! Take him We don't have any more ammo! We surrender? Well, decide! Should we give up Yes. Ride! Further! further! Hurry! Dad! Daddy! Daddy! Rudi, help me! Father only spent the night at the post office! He knew nothing! Ride! Hurry! The peasant is running out. It won't pull until the morning. Rajca, it's me, Stach. You do not recognise me? Quietly. Our! God's wounds! Our! Our?
