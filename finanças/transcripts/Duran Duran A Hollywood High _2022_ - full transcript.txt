♪ MTV A lad that was growing up in Birmingham where sunshine was in real short supply. Palm trees definitely were. When I first arrived in LA, I thought I arrived in paradise. Los Angeles for me has always been about Sunset Strip. I remember the first time we arrived here. We were staying on Sunset at a hotel that was then called the Hyatt. But it was known as the "Riot House." I'd first read about it in Ian Hunter's book, "Diary of a Rock'n'Roll Star." And I was determined that we'd stay there one day, and we did. It was fun while it lasted, but remarkably, we managed to get ourselves thrown out for bad behavior, which I guess was like having a badge of honor at the time. It's rock'n'roll. You know, New York was punk. LA is rock'n'roll and always has been. I did like Sunset. I liked the energy around the Strip. It's those endless, wide boulevards with the palm trees and the beautiful light that characterizes Los Angeles for me. And I feel like I'm in a film noir when I'm traveling in a car and there's someone next to me talking about a dame with a gun in her handbag. We did an in-store at The Licorice Pizza. And, you know, and just being in the back of a limousine, you know, on the freeway system here, it just... It's a very uplifting place to be. I remember the very first time that we entered the city of Los Angeles. We drove in. I remember seeing these huge oil extraction machines. They looked like... They reminded me of this duck thing that my grandfather used to have which used to put its nose down, fill up with water and then go glub-glub-glub-glub-glub. And I'd never seen so much commercial advertising. It was a huge, visual input as we drove up the hill, and in the background is the Hollywood sign. Playing in Los Angeles on Sunset at the Roxy, it was one of those landmarks for us. It was a terrific learning experience. I mean, I think that whole first American tour actually was probably one of the most fun things I ever did. We seemed to be flavor of the moment when we first came to LA. We were being played on KROQ, being played in the clubs. So that we were known in a kind of quite underground way. We would do a gig. We would meet some fans after the show, and they'd invite us back to their place to have a party, and we'd go and hang. Our first show, incredible. We were really, really hot. You know, I really did enjoy those early tours of America. It hadn't reached that kind of level of intensity. It was such an exciting time. Probably one of our last times that we could actually walk around on the streets. Stand back! We had two shows. We had a matinee and an evening show. And management had taken upon themselves to invite people. And they actually invited Nina Simone. And Nina didn't come. But she sent a little card. And I guess because I'm the front man, the lead singer, she addressed it to me. It said, "Dear Simon. Um, "Terribly sorry, I can't make it. Have a great show. Nina." And it was this lovely card like a birthday card with balloons on it, and full of balloons. It's beautiful. Still got it. It's a treasured possession, it really is. And we played these two shows, and we were magnificent. I got so much inspiration from the scene that it just made its way into the music. Well, the song that springs to mind is the song "Rio." The lyric and the melody were both written after our first trip to America. "From mountains in the North down to the Rio Grande." That's this part of the world I'm talking about. The cultural history for me has always been about the whole town being based upon the movie industry. Of course, there's a complete obsession with fame and star culture. Fame, fame, fame. Liquor stores that always seem to be amplified by neon. Liquor store! I'd never been anywhere like it before. You know, we'd been to New York. And we thought, oh, okay, this is what America is like. It's not. LA is just so different. It's like a different country. Another time when we were here very early on we went into the studio with a producer, David Kershenbaum to remix the "Rio" album. FM radio here was a big, compressed sound. And when you got into a car, it just hit you like a wave. And certainly the single "Hungry Like the Wolf" which is what broke us in America, that was the mix that we did with David, not the original version. But I think the fact that you'd come from an A&R background as well, you recognized the songs. - Correct. - Um, because I think that was a lot of the thing with some of the other people we were dealing with in America, it was... they'd take it to radio and they'd just go, uh, I don't know, the sound isn't fitting for us, but you knew what it was to make it like that. And honestly, that... those sessions that we did together was first for the "Carnival" EP which were the longer remixes. And then you also remixed a whole side of the album. I think so, yeah, and we did... As I remember, we did, uh, "Hungry Like the Wolf" first, and it started to get reaction. And they said why don't you go back and do some more. And I think we did. I think we did "Save a Prayer." I don't remember... - Yeah, we did "Save a Prayer." We definitely did "Hold Back the Rain." - "Hold Back the Rain." - There's at least five or six of those tracks. But I really do feel genuinely that you lit the touch paper that ignited, um, America for, for, for the band. - Oh, wow. - So I'm very grateful... - I'm grateful too, thank you. I'm glad we're sitting here today, you know, looking back with those great memories. 'Cause it was, it was a magical time. - Yeah. - It was a magical time. Yeah, it really was. We were doing a tour in '83, I guess. And we did the press conference at the Magic Castle. When did you learn an instrument? I learned to use my instrument... ...when I was... - And most successful at it. At five, actually, but it was plastic at the time. I was what you call a late developer. I didn't pick up mine until I was about 16. I was born with my instrument, and it just got used sort of again and again and again. The media were asking all these different questions. And inevitably being British and not being able to help ourselves, they got answers that perhaps they weren't expecting. I started playing with mine when I was, um... ...17. - Um... - Roger's still... Roger needs two hands for his. The location for the show was chosen because of its proximity to the Capital Records building. We first started talking about some kind of a performance in Hollywood quite a few months ago. As we kind of honed in on what it was that we were going to do. And we went from like a truck to one rooftop to another rooftop, and we ended up with this particular location in Hollywood. So the first time we actually went into Capitol Records, I remember thinking how strange that the building is round. It reminded me of the Rotunda which was a building that John, Roger, and I grew up with in the center of Birmingham. I think it's probably the greatest like music architecture landmark in the world or certainly building. This building makes me crazy. I would love to get out of here 'cause a record company should be horizontal. The building kind of puts a damper on the kind of enthusiasm that a record company should have. Capitol Records was our label. It really felt like something big was about to happen. And I was kind of proud of the fact that we had this label with this iconic building. - I didn't quite know how important Capitol Records was. I knew there was a link with The Beatles. It wasn't the coolest label. They used to call it the house that Frank built. Because it was supposedly like Frank Sinatra's royalties that paid for it. Other entertainment news this morning. If you're a fan of Duran Duran... A big honor tonight for the rock group Duran Duran. Duran Duran has been honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The Hollywood Walk of Fame is so kind of, um... People relate to it mostly for film people, but when you see our star is next to John Lennon's, that really kind of hits home. I think of all the time we've ever spent in LA and all the people we've ever met and all the things we've ever done, actually, by far, the most significant to Duran Duran was meeting Warren Cuccurullo who was in the band Missing Persons at the time. And after that, he joined us for a 15-year period. He's a remarkable musician, and I treasure all the things that we did together. Warren came over to New York to meet with us. And there's one track that exists on Duran Duran. It's a track called "American Science" on the "Notorious" album where there's two little solos. One is Warren Cuccurullo, one is Andy Taylor. So it was closing one door and opening the other. And Warren stayed with us all the way through until the reunion. ♪ Ooh... As a band, we have largely steered clear of making any kind of political statements. However, the plight of the people in the Ukraine has been do deeply upsetting. The situation was clearly a humanitarian disaster. And we just wanted to show our support. I think for me, you know, when you trade in entertainment of a particular kind, sort of escapism, I suppose, you might say, you know, you're doing it against this backdrop of concern. Is there any way to incorporate that concern into what you're doing and was this incredible opportunity to light up the Capitol Building. And I wasn't even sure it was possible. But when I first saw it illuminated, it was quite heartwarming actually. It was a prayer from Duran Duran. You know, and it was about four minutes long. Back in the UK pre-pandemic, we'd started to write a new album which eventually became "Future Past." I think it's some of the strongest material we've done together in quite a long time. "Anniversary." John presented the title. He said it's our 40th anniversary. Let's write a song. You know, we made a long list of ways that we could imagine ourselves celebrating our anniversary. And one idea was to write a song. "Anniversary" was a track that we built in the studio referencing some of our older material. We've never done that before. I think it's almost like a, uh, a throwback to "Wild Boys", isn't it? It's got that kind of throbbing, tribal feel to the rhythm section. It was built out of a riff that Graham Coxon started playing. Then Nick started playing along with it and... You know, very unusual when Nick says "I love that riff." It's a very Duran Duran sounding track that one is. Reminds me of quite a few songs that we've done before. I often said this record has got one foot in the past and one in the future. And it was strange doing something a little more reflective because we're always looking forward through the mirror onto the other side, but this time it was staring back at us. When you finally release an album, you know that it's the beginning of a new phase, and that it's time to play shows again. We wanted to do something really special in LA. I can't say that we've ever played on a rooftop before. We've done a photograph on a rooftop, but I can't say that we've ever played on a roof before.
