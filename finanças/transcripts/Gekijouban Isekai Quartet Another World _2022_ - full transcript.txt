Welcome, everyone. Let me begin by offering my deepest thanks on behalf of all of us. I, Erich von Rerugen, as your class assistant teacher will share what to keep in mind when watching. Please turn off your phone during the film, or set it to silent mode. You should be looking at the big screen, not your phone screen. That's a clever way of explaining. Not only recording is prohibited but also avoids any suspicious behavior. An impression is something that should be kept in your heart. Again, that's clever. Please be quiet during the film. Be considerate of those around you. But there may be times when you laugh unintentionally. When that happens, you can laugh. But please do it quietly. Who is that supposed to be? To light a fire in the theater is strictly prohibited. Of course, that also goes for bringing anything dangerous. What's the matter, Mr Rerugen? No, I thought that one was quite ordinary of you. Did you want me to say something out of ordinary? No. - Then, I will take your word. - Don't do it, Mr Roswaal! - That's what you want, right? - Don't do it, Mr Roswaal! So basically, enjoy the show without causing trouble for others. If we find you, you're getting sent to the life guidance room. That's... Well, then. Enjoy "Isekai Quartet the Movie: Another World" to the fullest! The Golem is out of control again. Come with me! Like I said! How did we get into this mess? Are you okay, Subaru? At the moment! What about you, Beako? Who do you think you're talking to? Looks like I'm not strong enough to stop it right now. Leave it to me! I just have to get its attention! Look! A wild succubus taking a bath there! Are you an idiot?! But...! It would've worked on you! Shield Man, can you stop that thing? It's Naofumi. I don't know if I can, but I'll try. Air Strike Shield! Second Shield! No way. I'll be the shield here! Darkness, please calm down. Demiurge, do you know what that thing is? Yes, that is a Siege Golem. In our world, it's known as the strongest golem in terms of physical attack. Strongest? By the way, what are our chances of winning with our current strength? I think it's zero. Looks like we've got no choice. I think it's my turn here. Well, I can't deny it. There's only one way out of this mess. Was there ever any other way? You got a point. You who have been captivated by the instinct of destruction... No! Don't do it! Why? - We are on a bridge! There's a river below us! - It's time to pull apart the flame of darkness. - You're right! - My strike will turn anything into everlasting darkness. - Megumin, stop! - My strike will turn anything into everlasting darkness. No! I'm doing it! - Leave it to me! - Let the dust envelop you. - If it's a golem, then my Steal can work. - Let the dust envelop you. - I'm afraid that it unlikely will work on it. - May the ultimate void strengthen my magic. - We won't know until we try it! - When the crimson magic reaches its peak... When the crimson magic reaches its peak... I said I was going to do it! Explosion! Don't get in between! Panties! Even at a time like this, he's... This is not my fault! Are those humans? Isekai Quartet the Movie: ~Another World~ Geez, Subaru is always a dork. My bad, my bad. (Class 2) My bad, my bad. (Class 2) I will toss you up, so please forgive me. I'm not that cheap, I suppose. But just this once, I'll let you off. - Beatrice has been in a good mood lately. - Thank you, Beako. And she's very clingy to Subaru. So, this is a magic item that can make you fly. Yeah, although we couldn't bring our Magic Gun. I'll see if we can find a substitute at the school. Perhaps the toy gun from the festival stalls? You've been more cheerful lately. Is that so? I guess you're right. Did something happen? You haven't been with Emilia lately. Yeah, I thought she will do fine here. On the other hand, Ram is all over Rem. Of course. Since she's one of two things that are more important to me than anything else. I understand how you feel. But for me, I only have one thing that is more precious to me than anything. And that is... Lord Ainz. That's correct. Me too! Lord Ainz. I haven't finished it yet! Oh my. What's with Class 1 doing here? Nothing. I'm just here to deliver the handouts Teacher asked for. I understand. I will hand it out to everyone. Thank you. By the way, Sir Meowfumi. "Meow"? What do you want? - I think I've seen your shield - No comment on that? I think I've seen your shield can do some rope technique. Would you use it on me? These overflowing mana... As I thought, Chomusuke isn't a normal cat. Well, it's fine if she isn't a normal cat. A cat-like creature, or something like... This is bad! I need to run away... No. How about teleporting or switching places? Building a barrier or attacking it with magic? Yup, it's too late. Lord Ainz! Chomusuke! What just happened? Here we are. After we got away from the golem, but the explosion magic separated us. What about the others? Where... ...are we right now? I'm all alone?! Where am I? This is... The golem from Yggdrasil? Are these also golems? And what is that? Why me? Why are they attacking me? There's no end to this. You're right. By the way... Yes? What's with that morning star? It's for protection. Protection, huh. Yes, it's for protection. They're both strong. Of course, since Rem is my little sister. That's given. Why don't you fight? If I was serious, this will end in an instant. Then... After that, someone would have to carry me. Pervert. I don't know why you called me a pervert, but becoming immobile in this situation is troublesome. Naofumi. We're done with preparation, let's retreat. Yeah! Alright everyone, gather around me! Rem, as expected, this man is a pervert. Yes, Sister, as expected, this man is a beast. Wait, please not you too. Let's fly until the base of that mountain! Wait, Aqua is still... Hey you no-good woman! Hurry and come here! Even if you said that, I can't right now. Wait, did you just call me no-good? - I need you to come here before I cast Shield Prison. - Wait, did you just call me no-good? Don't worry. Until the base of that mountain, right? Al Huma! Please hang on to it. Shield Prison! Let's go! Yeah! I can't believe you locked us like this. Rem, as I thought, this man is a bigger pervert. Sister, I think he's fighting against his animal nature. Could you stop with the selfish descriptions, please? Emergency landing! Prepare for impact! Prepare for impact! What? How do I prepare? Tell me! We're about to have a shock landing, so please bear with it. That doesn't answer my question! Who are they? Another loud voice. Golems have been very active lately. And that happen ever since she left. This is not a time to be sad. Right! I didn't feel sad at all. I mean, you saw it too, right? There are so many people who came to this world. I couldn't be happier than this! First of all, let's find them. Wait, look! I'm really sorry. This is because of my party members. It's fine. It's not your fault. We can escape from that huge thing, so it all worked out. That makes me happy when you say it like that. For the time being, let's find a village or something like that. That huge thing... Golem. Since that golem is from your world, does that mean this is your world? No, this isn't our world. Hey. What's that? It looks suspicious indeed. That looks like a place where the last boss resides. Alright, let's go there! Did you hear me just now? The last boss is there! We are not ready here. Rather than that. Huh? We've been seen. Seen by who, Beatrice? That's a little one. It seems ready to attack us. Wait! Huh? Who's that? I see. I'm curious about what you see from that, but first, what should we do with that? Let's see the situation first. Situation? It's okay. Everything's okay. Please calm down. Just calm down. You're okay now. Everyone, it's fine already. What?! For time being, stay down. But why? Please release me! - I'm not a suspicious person! - Aura, that's too much! We need to talk with her. Is that so? Okay, then. That hurts. Please don't be violent. Who are you? State your name! Are you wondering of who I am? Sure. My name is Pantagruel! I am the guardian of this world, and who walks with the golems! Wow, those introduction reminds me of someone. I think we all here are thinking the same thing. Well... Pantagruel? Can I ask for an explanation? What did you just do? Calming the golem which is out of control. Out of control? Yes. All the golems in this world are out of control right now. Pantagruel. This world. Out of control golems. Yup, too much information. I will explain the detail later at our village. I will take you there. Why should we have to go there? Isn't that fine? We got another human at our place. There's a human? Yes, a person named Alec is there. What do you think? That's not a bad idea. Also, the possibility of this being a trap is low. The village is this way! You're not even waiting for us, huh? You won't be coming? Of course we will! Hurry up! If not, I will leave you behind. Subaru! You lot! I'm glad everyone is fine. Subaru! Master! I'm glad you're okay. Subaru, I already checked, and this village is safe. I see, thank you so much. I'm also glad to see you again. Well, Demiurge? Why are you looking at me like that? I'm jealous. What? I also want to express my affection to Supreme One like that. Huh? Finally, you all are here! Aqua, you're here too. I'm glad you're okay. What about Kazuma and the others? We're the only ones here. So, Emilia's not here. Anyway... Rem, we need to get going. Just a little bit. Rem. Our guest seems to be tired. And who are you? How about we eat first? Right! Please wait for it! I will prepare something good for you. Filo will help too! Well... Nice to meet you, I'm Alec. And you are? I'm Natsuki Subaru. The man who broke beyond compare. Nice to meet ya. Natsuki Subaru. Subaru is the one you call me with. I guess it sounds unusual here. You're right. Because of that, I can remember it easily. That's quite mean! Once again, welcome. Natsuki Subaru. You must be hungry right? Let's talk while we eat. Yeah. Alec, huh? Seems like a good person. Yes, he's a good person. He is usually aloof, but no matter what I say to him, he always responds with a smile. He is a very nice person. By the way, where are the other people? I'd like to say hello. There aren't any. There are only two humans in this world. Does this world only have two people?! Are you serious? And what about the other one? A girl named Vera. Where's that Vera right now? About Vera... She already left. Is that so? Yes, that's right. A world where golems are out of control. There are only two humans here. What a harsh condition this place is. I'm worried about Emilia and the others. Don't worry, Subaru. Isn't Class 2 filled with reliable people? You're right. Everyone is indeed full of reliable people. Although, I'm worried about Kazuma. Me too. I'm hungry. There's nothing here. My feet hurts. And weird things are attacking me. What's with this place? Out of my way! A rock! It feels really suspicious. No other choice than to go and follow her. Lurk. Who's there? Who are you? How did you come here? Show your face! That's a lot of questions at once. I'm not sure how to answer you. A grim reaper? That's rather rude of you, to call me a grim reaper. Though, if you mean that I can command death, it's not completely wrong. From what I see, she's just a normal human. Not that tough either. Then, let's act intimidating and get information from her. Don't be so scared. My name is Ainz... Oh! It's you, Ainz! Oh, well. So, she's your acquaintance? I'm glad. I've been so lonely, you know. I'm Sato Kazuma. Nice to meet you. Just call me Kazuma. And, Miss, you are? A knife? Kazuma, she's not my acquaintance. I just realized that now. Don't bring out such a dangerous thing. Steal! No, this is... Kazuma. You're wrong, Ainz! This is, how should I say it... I sincerely apologize. I will respectfully return this. Of course you should! You guys, attack! That's rude. First of all, let's talk. I think the one who suddenly appear and took my underwear is ruder. - Fair point. - I'm sorry. Anyway, using golems? You can't defeat me with these. And naturally... Even if you use that knife. Right. I don't think I stand a chance against you. So, what do you want? Do you want to kill me? Or do you want to torture me? That guy took my underwear. Do you want to harass me? What's wrong? Say something! She said so many words with a lot of loathing. I was numb to it because someone always said that with so much excitement. Did you catch a cold, Darkness? No. Let's continue our talk. Yeah. You see... About these huge golems here, these are the very same golems of my world. What? So, this is the world you came from? No. I can't use some of the magic that I use in my world. It is reasonable to think this is a different world. In short, we have been transported to this world by some force. Perhaps, just like her. What? Are you not one of those who have wandered into this world? What's wrong? Vera Metrohina. That is my name. I have a name too, you know. True. That was very rude of me. My apologies. What's wrong? Uh, well... She would be startled if someone with that appearance apologized. Is that so? I think you got a point. I've been in school so long that I have forgotten how I look. I haven't introduced myself either. My name is Ainz Ooal Gown. Ainz Ooal Gown the Grim Reaper. Without the grim reaper. By the way, what is that? I'm sensing an ominous presence from that thing. There's no point hiding it from you, huh? That's a teleporting device to other worlds. What? I read that in the diary of one of the people who used this facility. I see, this sphere seems to be filled with a vast amount of energy. But now is in dormant status. Is there some condition to activate it? As expected of Ainz Ooal Gown the Grim Reaper. Without the grim reaper. Can I ask you a question? Yeah. Did you two want to go back to your world? Yeah, I suppose so. Then I have an offer. Okay! Leave it to us! That was fast! "Would you like to work together in order to go back?" Something like that? That's right, Ainz Ooal Gown. And as you said, I've come from a different world. I see. I have to go back to my world. How about the three of us working together? I have some information you don't have. That's not a bad offer, I think. Right. We welcome this cooperation. Are you sure? Yeah. You're not lying, right? It wouldn't do any good to lie to you. Yeah. You got a point. Yeah. Vera, let's work together. Is there something funny? Well, I got a weird feeling hearing that from someone with that look. Is that so? It is. Ainz can be surprisingly cute, huh? Don't call me cute! Looking forward to working with you, Ainz Ooal Gown. I believe that you won't lie to me. We'll get back to our world. You can call me Ainz. Looking forward to working with you, Vera. And Kazuma. Looking forward to working with you, Vera. Likewise, Kazuma. But... It hurts. I won't forgive you if you steal my underwear again. Yes, Ma'am. I will bring the diary, so could you wait here? Understood. You guys, follow me. Vera, can I ask one more question? What? You said, that you have to return to your world. Have you had some unfinished business in your world? Yes, I have. I'm going to end "my" war... with these guys. I will come back soon. Let's go. Ainz. Vera's uniform is the same as Tanya's, right? You also noticed it, too? Yes, you are right. I think she's also one of Tanya's friends. Well, since our goal to come back are same. There's no harm in getting along. I hope so. I am also interested in this facility and how she is able to move the golems. - In the first place, - Vera! Can you tell me where the toilet is? - why are Yggdrasil golems in this world? - Please show me the way! Don't enter! Are you in some special ritual or something? I'm wearing the underwear you stole from me. I'm sorry! My dear classmates. How are you doing? We're currently spending our day fighting against endless waves of golems. I want to shoot my Explosion magic! First of all, you can't even move yet. What we are doing is barbarianism itself. There is no such thing as a non-barbaric human being. That statement is racist against humanity. Does it make sense to keep doing this? It does. Right now, we don't know where we're going, so we just let the enemy find us. It's simple, right? If we're this rowdy, there's a high chance our friends will notice us. But I feel kinda bad. You are an honest person. I'm no longer hesitant to do this kind of work. Now, everyone, let's wrap this up and take a little break. We're not the only ones having a hard time! I'm sure Subaru and others are doing their best. So we need to do our best too! That's the spirit. Let's go all out! So delicious! I can understand Filo, but first lieutenant Serebryakova... You eat too much. That's right. It's gone already. Everything is gone! I'm going to be straight to the point. Is there any way for us to return to our original world? There is... not. There isn't? I'm sorry. But we didn't have that kind of information. I understand. Then, let's move towards the next question. - Why... - Hey. Why did we get attacked by those golems? Even though they are very kind. Actually, the golems in this world didn't attack humans. If... If it weren't for that ring. Ring? There is a ring that can make you command the golem. When you wear that ring, you can command these golems. That is a very dangerous item. So there is someone using that to make the golems go wild? That's right. And who's that person? What's wrong? I'll take it from here. The one who uses the ring is Vera. Is that the one you mentioned earlier? About her... She's taken out the ring that allows her to command the golems. I don't understand. If this Vera can command the golem with the ring, why did she use that to attack us? Naofumi. What? You look cute in that apron. Shut up. I guess she's doing a test. A test? Yes. Testing the golem's strength. And their capabilities. But for what? She came from a world full of war. From what I hear, the situation there is not going well. You know, Vera wants to bring the golems to her world. Don't tell me... Immortal soldiers. Soldiers who do as it's told. Don't need to eat or are afraid of death. Someone who controls immortal soldiers could change the course of the war. Correct. Such thing... Is something that shouldn't be done. The problem of each world should be solved by its people. Either way, she also can't go back, right? So, there is no need to think about her now. All that matters to me is the whereabouts of Supreme One who is not here now. Shalltear is right. Before we search for the way to go back, the first thing to do is to find Lord Ainz... And the other classmates. To find Lord Ainz and the others. Let's get this done first. Is that alright with everyone? Yeah, no objections. The key to this device is... If it's released... It's possible to go back to the original world? Vera? What are you doing in my room? Is that... Pantagruel. So, you lied when you said that I can't go back? No, it's not like that. - You're wrong, Vera. - What's wrong? It's time for dinner. Alec, you knew about it too? That Pantagruel... That she was lying all this time. About what? Don't play dumb! It's written here that there's a way to go back to the original world. About that... Whatever. With this, I can return to my world. Vera! Did you want to go back? To that world full of war? Yeah. I'm going to go back. Vera, you said it yourself. That is an awful world filled with wars. There is nothing here, but you got home. Yeah, I did say that. But the story is different because of this. As long as I have this, I can end the war in my world. I can protect my home. My real home. Did you wait long? Not at all. So that's the diary with the information on how to get back to the original world? Yeah. To activate this device, we have to insert something here. But I don't know what the words on this page mean. Let's see. Eighth... grade... syndrome? Correct. In the diary, it's written that we have to insert proof of eighth-grade syndrome. However, I don't know the meaning of that word. About eighth-grade syndrome? Yes, eighth-grade syndrome. You two know about that word? I know, but... Please tell me the meaning of that word! What is an eighth-grade syndrome? Well, it is not a thing. It is not a thing? It's like a disease. Disease? In what part? Brain? Isn't that dangerous? Well, you could say it is dangerous. Is that disease incurable? No, it can be cured. Did you already recover? I've never got that syndrome, to begin with. I don't quite understand, but... I do know that both of you know a lot about this. What are the symptoms of this disease? Well... Symptoms, huh? They tend to say and do things that are different from the socially accepted norms, which is a detriment to their normal social life. Or something like that? I don't understand at all. I guess so. What exactly do you mean by that explanation? Could you demonstrate it, Ainz? Me? It could be a hint about the key. Please, Ainz Ooal Gown! I need your help right now. I think Kazuma too could demonstrate it. Please, Ainz? I'll remember this, Kazuma. Just mimic Megumin. It should be fine. "My name is Ainz Ooal Gown," like that. I don't want to do that. Ainz! My name is Ainz Ooal Gown! I am the lord of the Great Tomb of Nazarick and the ruler of the Sorcerer Kingdom! The one who love death, and the one that is loved by death! What did I just do? Why did I say that I am loved by death? So embarrassing! Don't look at me like that, both of you! There's nothing strange at all. With how you look and what you said, it's totally perfect. Is eighth-grade syndrome refer to someone like Ainz? That's wrong! So basically... Do you understand? I think so. Do you understand that I haven't had eighth-grade syndrome? I'm not sure about that part, but I'll try to understand. Please do. How exactly does that disease do with this? Probably it's the belonging of someone with that disease, and placed in this. This is like an eye patch, isn't it? You are right. What's wrong? Eye patch... Eighth-grade syndrome... Pantagruel... What? Is that true? Yes. We've seen a continuous explosion from the wasteland in the north. We can assume a battle's taking place there. I think that's where our classmates are. That's right. Because no one can fight against golems in this world. We also saw a huge chunk of ice there. That's probably Emilia. I'm glad she's safe. We shouldn't be here then. Let's go to meet them! I'm going too! I might be able to help you. You need someone to protect you. I'm going too. Obviously, Betty will go with you, I suppose. Of course. Well... Doesn't sound like a problem to me. I leave the north to you. Yeah, leave it to us. By the way, why are Aqua going with us? Because it seems fun. Fun? We aren't going to a picnic, you know? Come on. There's nothing fun staying in that village. That's rude! There's Alec there. Only him. Pantagruel. Yes. Did Alec come here from a different world, too? Yes. Because Alec is here, every day is fun. It seems there's a lot going on with him too. You bet, but he didn't talk about it too much. But because of you, Alec is saved. I mean, being alone is lonely. You are right. Being alone is lonely. That's right, being alone is lonely. You're not alone anymore, Beako. I know. I'm also not alone either. I never say that. Really? You don't think I'm a poor girl? Yeah. Really? Are you okay? Aqua, you're really a strange person. You are always lively, and cheerful. Very lovely! Is that so? Of course! Since I'm a goddess. You still continue to call yourself a god? You sound like Tanya. There's no way a goddess like you exists. What did you say? Indeed. Aqua doesn't look like a goddess. Huh? By the way, Pantagruel. Yes? If you have something to confess, as a goddess, I'd listen to it. Huh? About what? When we were talking about going back, you had something on your mind, right? You must be worried about something. Despite how she is, she's quite sharp. That's right. - Because I'm a great... - I'm a liar. Yes, a liar. Wait, what? Actually, I'm telling a very big lie. You are? That's right. But lies, you know... It's not a big deal. You don't have to confess if it's hard. Aqua, she's trying to confess. So as a goddess, listen to her. Right. Yeah. You know... In that building, there's a device that can return you back. So it's like that? Then, that's not a big deal. What?! Hey, you said that there's no way to return. Yes. I was lying. Then, if we go there, we can go back? But there are several conditions. Why did you decide to tell us? I don't know. I'm not sure, but... I feel that I should stop running from reality. Pantagruel. Yes? In the Axis Order which worships me, there's a saying, "You can run away if it's hard." "Running away is not losing, because running away can also mean a victory." Like that. Oh... So don't worry. In the name of the Goddess of Water, I forgive you for your lie. Thank you for telling us. Aqua. What? You are really a lovely person. As for now, you won't be able to go back. Neither Vera nor any of you. So I'll tell you the conditions. Let's wait until everyone is here. You got a point. Then first, let's go get your friends! Are you sure it was okay to tell us that? Even though you were lying to hide it? Yes, it's fine. Maybe I've just realized it. About what? The importance of facing the person you love, I guess. We are near the destination. They've been on a rampage the whole time? Something just flying! What a cruel thing to do. Let's stop them! Yeah, it's too much. Wait! We shall chase them, I suppose. Yeah! I detected two strange presences. They're coming at a tremendous speed. What? I can't see it yet. Don't you understand? Presence of a mad woman who calls herself a god. That's indeed an unpleasant one. Yeah, that confirms it. You just bad-mouthed me! Weren't you?! You overdid it, you fool! Do you know what's the key? Yeah. I also know where it is. I see. We still don't have much information. It's not a good idea to go out now. I'd also like to find out why the golems are here. I would like to look into this facility. Please do. There may be something in the underground storage. Shall I go together with you? I refuse. Why? Do you want someone who steals underwear to go with you? I can't deny it. I'm truly sorry. If it's that the case, I'll give you an escort. Amazing. It can only exist for a short time, I made it so that it follows your order. I appreciate it. Alright, let's go. Well, then... Shall we go? Yeah. Why do I have to be the one to get scolded at? Because you disobeyed Lord Ainz's order to be good with classmates. But! I'm glad you're okay. I should be the one who said it. Can you stand? Thank you very much. It seems you're only good at manners. Did you just say something? You are... Already understanding each other? This is... Since you seemed tired. So, everyone is in the village where that Pantagruel lives? - So, everyone is in the village - Do you have some connections with me? - where that Pantagruel lives? - What do you think? Yeah. Furthermore, there's someone who can tell us about this world. For now, we all are decided to make that village our gathering point. Let's get going there now. Okay. Everyone, our destination is Pantagruel's village! Yes! You two, how long are you going to be like that? I'm glad you're safe, First Lieutenant Serebryakova. You too, Major! We're all unharmed. All unharmed. Excellent. By the way, where is this man called Alec? He was just here. He must be in the cathedral. Cathedral... I'll take you there. I'll go too! Cathedral! Cathedral! Alec, I brought everyone with me. Don't come here, Pantagruel! Vera, you are back. It's been a while, Pantagruel. Vera... What's going on? What's happening? To think that you're the key to making me return to my world. I had no idea. That's... Thinking back, you perfectly match with the eighth-grade syndrome. What is an eighth-grade syndrome? There's no need for you to know. Let her go! Who are you? That's very rude to ask. But if you want to know, I'll tell you. My name is Megumin! Number one Arch Wizard in Axel, and master of the ultimate magic! The one who loves Explosion, and is loved by Explosion! The one who loves Explosion, and is loved by Explosion! My name is Ainz Ooal Gown! I am the lord of the Great Tomb of Nazarick and the ruler of the Sorcerer Kingdom! The one who love death, and the one that is loved by death! She also has eighth-grade syndrome with an eye patch. Eighth-grade syndrome... Some have called me that in the past. I don't know what it means, but I do know that it's rude. Wait a minute, Pantagruel. You are the key, right? It's not her, right? - Vera! - What are you doing? That medal's from our army. From which division? Could you explain what's going on? I'm from 203rd Aerial Mage Battalion... Tanya von Degurechaff the White Silver, If you know who I am, then we can talk. I do. A pathetic dog, brainwashed by the Empire. Just looking at you makes me want to vomit. What are you... There's no need to lie about who I am in this world. My name is Vera Metrohina. Unified States agent... Undercover in the Empire. First Lieutenant. You'd rather talk than fight? We're in no hurry. We can fight all we want after we're done talking. As expected of the White Silver. A rational monster. A pariah of war. Is that what people say about me? You are a Mad Dog who believes in Empire and glorifies war. Do you enjoy killing so much? Nope, not fun at all. That look in your eyes is truly evil. I was born with these eyes. You can't imagine, how people from the Empire are treated all around the world. Of course I can. Since I know the history, I'm well aware. You talk like you know what you're talking about, you little brat. That's a difference of opinion. But let's get to the point. What are you going to do with her? I will bring the golems and destroy your Empire. Bringing the golems to our world? Yeah. As long as I have this, I can destroy the Empire. I can end the war. Vera. Does that really come from your heart? Is that really what you believe? It's not weapons that cause war, but the people. Even so... Even so, I... I can end my war. Your war? My parents were born in the Empire. They left for the Unified States, and I was born there. How's it, White Silver? About my Imperial accent. That's pretty Imperial's tongue there, you must be given a good education. I was proud of it. Until the Empire made the world their enemy. The day the Empire started the war, (Empire Declares War!) (Full-scale invasion to the north?) the people around us started to avoid our accent, avoid us. People that were smiling at us until yesterday, suddenly ask us this question, "Are you the enemy?" The relationships we had until then became a lie. I didn't want to know, I would've been happy if the lie stay forever. It was the Empire who revealed that lie. It was you people! So you'll use those weapons to destroy the Empire? That's a bit of a leap. What did you know? Your invasion, your actions, cost us our home! That's not... It is not true? Look at me! I'm wearing the uniform of the country that ruined my life, and constantly lying to people! A human whose life has been ruined by lies, then using a lie to deceive as my mission. What a sick joke is that! It's wrong to lie. If I want to be free from these shackles, I have to destroy the Empire. Like a child throwing a tantrum. Shut up! This is the only way... The only way... for me to stay sane! You think we'll let you go! Come! Death Knight! Death Knight? Chomusuke?! Wait! We haven't done talking! Farewell, Imperial Dogs! You can live in despair here forever, in this empty wasteland! Vera! Damn it! Pantagruel was kidnapped? Yeah, by an agent calling herself Vera. They headed for the building on top of that hill. She said Pantagruel was the key, right? Right. And the way she talked... I will bring the golems and destroy your Empire. Does that mean, Pantagruel can bring us back home? I suppose so. And she had a Death Knight with her. That means Ainz probably is there as well. Subaru? Huh? After hearing that, Albedo and Shalltear ran outside. We just brought them back. You can't just go without a plan. Let me go, Rem! No. I want to go now! No. Anyway, the only person we still haven't found is Kazuma, right? I think Kazuma is with Ainz. How can you tell? About that... There was something that only Kazuma has tied to Death Knight's arm. And that is? It doesn't matter! The important thing is that Ainz and Kazuma are with that girl! I understand. Can you tell us what you understand? Our Supreme One always acts as if he knows everything. I understand... not at all! Anyway, our only choice is to go there. That's right. Let's start the briefing. Our target is that building. We have three objectives. Meeting with Lord Ainz and Kazuma. Capture the female agent, Vera. Then, rescue Pantagruel. When all three are complete, we can all return home. Yeah! Our flight devices are ready to go. What about weapons? Can you move, Megumin? Yes, better than ever! As you might know, my attacks never hit. Why? It hasn't been that much time. - That's troublesome... So you are useless then? - Why? It hasn't been that much time. Are you okay with this? Subaru, and... Emilia. Emilia. I see, Emilia. So, Subaru and Emilia, do you have something to say? We'll go back after everything's over. What are you implying? Alec, that's not what you want, is it? You knew Pantagruel was lying. But you didn't say anything. Why? If you don't want to go back to your world, I get that. Maybe something bad happened, or you want to start over and then do your best. I know there are people like that. That's very detailed. People have their own circumstances. It's not like that. Huh? It's not that I didn't want to go back. I had fun in my original world. I also had many people I cared for. I wasn't alone. Then, why? But... Pantagruel was always alone. For 300 years before she meets me 300 years... That's right. She was all alone until I arrived. You know what she's like. She loves talking to people. When I came, she looked so happy. When I was in total despair after being thrown into this empty world, I was saved by her cheerfulness. Vera, too. It was the same when she came. Pantagruel was lonely. She was lonely, and she'd be so sad if everyone left, that's why she lied. I couldn't blame her for her lie. No, the truth is that I had no intention of blaming her. But Vera found out the truth. Vera, are we not good enough? Because you lied. You lied to me. You lied to me! You lied to me and told me I couldn't go back! You betrayed me! Why? That's... You two forced your own convenience on me. Just like the Empire. Vera, that's... I don't want to hear excuses! I will go back to my world. Thanks for taking care of me for a short time, liars. Vera, you are wrong! You are wrong! Pantagruel blamed herself for that. Even though she already knew that Vera hate lies, but she lied to her. I knew that lie is wrong. But... It was something that Vera couldn't forgive. And that's what made her act like that? Tanya? Pantagruel didn't resist that time. It was like she went of her own free will. Right. I think Pantagruel made her decision. To face up against Vera. Major, we're all ready to go. I'm on my way. Vera Metrohina. She is an agent and enemy of our Empire. Under normal circumstances, she needs to be disposed of. However, this is a different world, and so with the rules. Included your regret, Alec. Regret? Not being able to stop her is your regret, am I right? So I promise you, Alec. That I will do my best to ensure your regret leads to the best outcome. Thank you, Young Lady. Young lady? Oh, that reaction is a new one. Right, it's fit since Tanya is a little girl. I do look like one, but... It's foolish to judge a person by how they look. You are as cute as you look, though. Of course! What are you all doing? Demiurge is getting tired of waiting. Alright! Let's give out our best! Alec? Huh? Do you have regrets? Yes, I have. I have regrets and contemplate them. Contemplate? I'm doing it. I think it's enough then. Even if you've done something that can't be undone, you still want to apologize, right? Then you have to apologize. Until they forgive you, or even if they don't forgive you. Truly, you are... Still the same good girl. What does that mean? You're a very good girl. That's what I meant. Thank you. What room is this? Wait! It's dirty! It's covered in dust. But somebody's been here. Is it Vera? Those aren't her footprints. Perhaps someone else. I just found one book that has less dust. Is that a diary? Let's see... "My otherworld life in another world, day 1." Crap! This black ball appeared out of nowhere and sucked me in. Now I think I'm in a whole new world. Hold it. I don't need to read the rest, I know it already. So it was you! Basically, we need to break the seal with the key if we want to go back. But when we do, the dangerous golem will be activated and destroy the world. Ainz, think you can beat it? I don't know, and to be honest, golems are like my natural enemy. Are you serious? I'm serious. (With this, they will move as you command) A ring? It's the same one Vera using to command the golems, right? Yeah. We can probably use it to command the golems. We can control the golems? That sounds handy. I'll take it. Vera! That hurts! Vera seems to have brought the key. Vera listen to me! If you break the seal... Shut up. You are back? Did you get the key... You brought all of it?! Yes. We want to talk, it's regarding the key. Is that so? I'd like to talk to you as well. What's this about? You are with the White Silver, aren't you? White Silver? Oh, Tanya? Yeah, your comrade... She's not my comrade. Huh? She's my enemy. Wait! That uniform is Imperial's, as Tanya and others. I am an agent from a different country. Huh? From our position, she's my enemy. Enemy? Ainz, did you know? Of course. Are you serious? I am serious. Since White Silver is my enemy, both of you as her friends are also my enemy. That's how you see it, huh? And since I'm your enemy, you won't listen to me? Yeah. I see. By the way, I'm just talking to myself here. If you break that seal, it's going to release a powerful and terrifying golem. Golem? Correct. One unlike the golems here. A super weapon that destroyed this world in the past. That's written in the diary we found. After hearing that, do you still consider us your enemy? Even if it's true, that doesn't matter. Since I have this. I can control it, no matter what it is. The strongest golem? That's better. I will bring this too back home. I don't think that ring is that strong for that golem. Vera, he's right! You can't use that to... Like I'd listen to a liar like you! You've been warned. Activate! And send me back to my world! There she goes. We can only watch it now. Ainz, Kazuma. Huh? You might be White Silver's friends and my enemies. But it's the truth that we worked together. So? I am someone who keeps my promises. I think I will return only two of you. Are you serious? Yeah. But just two of you. I'm afraid... Huh? That Kazuma and I are not the types to abandon our friends. Is that so? Kazuma, use Lurk to get out of here and tell the others what's going on. I will remain here and buy the time if necessary. Leave it to me. Though, I don't want to stay in this scary place. You make it sound cool, but what you're saying is pathetic. That's a compliment. Lurk. So, this is the strongest golem. It's more dangerous than I thought. Vera, this thing is bad news! Get away from it! This is... With this, I can destroy those devils, that Empire! That's quite the sight. Looks like she really doesn't want us to come. Then, let's proceed with the plan. Let's go. Is that fine? Yeah! Mare, protect that human and provide support. Understood. Well then, everyone! Are you ready? It's the time! Time to kick some ass, I suppose! Alright! Subaru, you bastard! It can't be helped. That's just who Subaru is. Follow those fools, everyone! Let's go, Subaru! Yeah, Beako! Minya! Wow, Subaru and Beatrice are hiding this much power. We can't let them overtake us. Are you ready, everyone? You don't need to tell us! Put your mana into it! Ingenuity is the essence of Imperial soldiers. Don't make us look incompetent! Return those clay to the dirt! Yes, Ma'am! I can't hit anything! Power of Gaia! I increased your strength... I mean your attack power. Thank you very much. As expected of my little sister. Yes, I am your little sister, after all. This is so plain. It's as plain as Naofumi. I can hear you! Koenig! Neumann! Scary, you are more like Hero of Hell's Ear. That's right. Don't give me weird nicknames! What's wrong, First Lieutenant Grantz? It's just... - Why is she about to cast Explosion magic? - The filling of my abyss. - Why is she about to cast Explosion magic? - The forbidden sign that has been handed down. Acalanātha! That seems scary. Scary? Yes, looks really scary. He should try smiling. The Immovable Wisdom King doesn't smile. Is that so? Is that just what you convinced yourself? Even if he can't now, someday he'll be able to. No, that's not what I meant. But this is what I meant! So that's what you meant? Wow, you're really amazing! Do you want to come with me, Filo? I belong to Master. You want to be with the person you love too, right? Yeah, you are right. Take this! They're no match for us. Right. Will those guys be our opponents? As expected, we'll have to go with Subaru's plan. And what was that? You weren't listening to the plan? I was listening, I just forgot. Raphtalia! I'm a Crusader. Protecting everyone is my duty! Just like Master Naofumi. The weight of this fist, though... It's wonderful! She's totally different. She's okay, I guess? Don't come this way! Even if you said that...! Thanks! Enough with the praise and start the counterattack! But I can't attack. Huh? I'm a healing goddess. I can heal, I cannot attack. Aqua, could you use God Blow to do something? That's too big, not possible. But you said that it could definitely kill anything. Yeah, it can kill anything. Except for golems. Right! It works on everything but golems. There's nothing I can do right now. You really are a useless creature. I heard that! You know, I can do more to you devils and undead! Want to try? No fighting between classmates! - That's just like you, to treat that as a squabble between classmates. - Subaru! Aqua, I need your help. If you want me to fight them, the answer is no. Not that. You're good at carpentry, right? Not to brag, but I'm as good as Kazuma. Is that so? You know, if you could pull this, you'd be the MVP. That won't get you anywhere. Wow! Wait! You shouldn't entrust an important task to this woman! They're both raring to go. Nobody says those words any... Wait, let's try it! So girls! What I want you both to make is a big door. Building a door here? What do you mean? I've told Weiss the plan. I leave it to you, guys! Leave it to us! You want it over here, Subaru? Yeah, right there! Let us do the grunt work! Albedo, Aqua! This is where you need to step up. Do your best! Long-faced man... It's Koenig. Fine! I'll show you the power of goddess! So you are actually the Goddess of Carpentry? Emilia, she's actually willing to work for once. Wait! I won't let you get ahead of me! This is getting us nowhere. The golems won't stop attacking. Not until we stop the one who commanded them. In the end, we need to stop Vera. Alec. What? You want to go see Vera, right? I think right now, there's something only you can do. I guess I have to. I can't turn down youngsters that are looking at me like that. I'm actually a lot older than you. That's right. No matter how old you get, there's always something to learn. So this is "in one's old age, one seeks after witches." I heard a word that is not good. I need your help. Please, can you take me to that building? To where Vera and Pantagruel are. Leave it to us! But how? Fly there using Naofumi's shield. You can do it right, Naofumi? Can we count on you? I have no choice. You owe me okay? Sure, I'll bring you the red one from the principal's office next time. I refuse. I can't get drunk. That's too bad. I'll go too. You need someone who can fight. First Lieutenant Serebryakova. Yes! You and the others are to remain here and whatever it takes, hold the line. Yes, Ma'am! Shield Prison! Hey. Who's pulling this? Well... Leave it to me. It might be a bit shaky, I'll throw it very gently, so forgive me. Huh? She's really strong. As expected of Emilia who got her seal released. Alright, I will do it now. - Do it. - Here I go! It's done! It didn't have to be that extravagant. - Weiss! - 'Kay! We are ready to go! Alright, here we go, Beako! Leave it to me! Got the first one. It did work well, I suppose. This is our combined attack! I call it Non-Stop Abyss! I see. Everyone, direct the golems to Subaru! Hey! Aura, Filo, will you help me? Sure! Filo will give her best! To be honest, I don't know what Subaru's plan is. But it seems fun! If you're going to do that, say it first! But it worked, right? What are Subaru and the others planning? It doesn't matter. But if we don't know, we won't know what we actually do. You don't need to understand. What? Even if we don't know, if Barusu is doing it, he's definitely winning. We just have to do our job. Cocytus, please get back. Okay. Al Fura! As expected of you, Sister! Is that man... Is that man really that amazing? Well... He's just got witch-like luck. In short, the Witch Boy. I can hear you, Big Sis! Stop talking, and finish it. Okay, thanks! Now, for the last one! It'll be tough to get close to it! But Visha is in trouble! As someone that walks alongside Major, I can't lose! Amazing! Visha, watch out! Don't be sloppy! Albedo... Visha, even as a human, if you want to walk alongside someone you care about, be strong! Just like me! No, you'd better be like me. The attacks aren't hitting her? Subaru, we just need to move this golem to that hole, right? Yeah! That's why we use this door... There's no need for that. Huh? Albedo. Yeah! Gate! This is... Like a cakewalk! Amazing! Wow. Are you in awe of my power? No, it's just I've never seen someone use the phrase "cakewalk" other than Lia. With this, all the big ones are inside the hole! - Then it's time... - When the wailing of lamentations resonates, - Not yet! - the crimson that lights the carnage will be manifested! - Huh? - the crimson that lights the carnage will be manifested! One more is coming! That is the first golem that attacked us. I call the power that lies within me, - This is bad! - screaming out of the vortex of despair! - Beako! - screaming out of the vortex of despair! - No need to tell me! - screaming out of the vortex of despair! The dead-end of the fates' scream! Earth Surge! So tough. Mare! Move from there, Mare! Assemble! Sorry to keep you waiting, guys! Kazuma! Yes, it's Kazuma! Where have you been? Kind of... You're not here when we need you! Huh?! Kazuma, are you hurt? I'm fine! You're always causing trouble for others! Huh?! We were worried about you. Thanks! What's with that "assemble" thing? We are not all here yet! You got a point! Anyway, apologize to everyone! Why are you the only one being so harsh on me? Because it was really hard to make this door without you! I don't know what's going on here! Kazuma! Throw that golem towards Aqua! Huh? I'm not sure I get it, but is that fine? Yeah! I just need to throw this big guy towards Aqua? That's right! Sure, I will do as you want. Wait, really? Throw this, towards Aqua! Alright! Are you okay, Aqua? - Long-faced... - It's Koenig. - Bunch of enemy-looking guys inside that hole. - Dominate, clear mind. - Over there, Megumin's chanting a spell. - Waiting for the time, predicting the winds, Waiting for the time, predicting the winds, and seeking permission to move, - I see. - the crimson incantation burn bright without fear of loneliness! Now! Blast them all, Megumin! You're saying that now? You weren't here all this time, and now you want to steal the spotlight? That's the Kazuma I know! This long incantation has been building for this moment! Elemental magic doesn't work on golems, so I'll blow them with my ultimate Explosion magic! Explosion! Did you see my awesomeness? Yep, a perfect score for you. Look! The building... Why? Move according to my command! This is an order! Meteor Fall! Magic jamming, huh? Do what I tell you! Hear me! Vera, you can't control that golem with that ring. Wha... The seal is broken. Let's break in! Tanya! What was that thing? The condition that needed to return. What? Vera. Alec. You broke the seal, didn't you? Yes. Since she was the key, I broke the seal and tried to control it with the ring. - So I can go back... - If you break the seal, you can go back to your world. That much is correct. I won't hide anything anymore. I'll tell you the truth that I hid from you. In this world, the only one who can control that golem is Pantagruel. Only her. That's right. I'm the only one who can control it. Everyone, please take me to that golem. Pantagruel... I'm sorry for lying to you, Vera. Now you'll be able to go back. Pantagruel... Yes. Are you okay with that? It will solve everything. It won't! If you go inside it, you won't be able to go out anymore. Huh? Alec... You knew, huh? Yeah. Since I've read the diary of the one who made you. I see. If you go inside it, the personality of "Pantagruel" will cease to exist. I'm asking if you are okay with that. No way. Mr Skeleton. You mean me? Yes. What are golems like? Well... They have no will of their own, made to follow the commands. In short, programmed units. I suppose so. And I am one of them. A golem, a programmed unit. That's why... I'm okay. I'm going to do what I was made to do. I'm sorry, Alec. I'm sorry for all the trouble I've caused you with my selfishness. Right. You really are a handful. But I was saved by you. You embarrassed me. Vera, I had a lot of fun with you. Wait. When you go back, don't do anything dangerous. You are cuter when you smile. But that's not... Okay. It's time to go. Take me to that golem. Wait. Are you sure? Are you worried about a weapon? Wait! In respect of your free will, we will take you there no matter what. White Silver! The arrow has already been shot! Pantagruel, I will not let your resolve go to waste. Yes. May God bless you all. Please stop saying that. God is the one that I hate the most. Wait, please. - Is that so? - Wait, please. Yeah. Vera. Alec... I'm sorry that I didn't tell you. I didn't want to see her sad or to lose her. But... For now, I want to face her feelings. To face her feelings? So, Vera... See Pantagruel off with a smile. Together with me. I can't... Ainz, I will deal with things here. Do something about that magic steam. Alright. I'll try. Fly! Attention to classmates! Something scary just appeared! The Supreme One will do something about that golem's magic steam. In midst of that, take Pantagruel and... What should we do with Pantagruel? I see. Huh? It seems only Pantagruel can seal that golem. The Supreme One will seal away its steam, so Kazuma, stop its movement! While you do that, we'll do a relay toss to get her into its left eye. Demiurge is really amazing. I will now designate the tossers. I think Tanya will be the first to throw. Someone close to there is... That's me! Weiss. Huh? Wait! Why not me? Rem will be the third tosser. Understood. The fourth will be Filo. Filo will give her best! Fifth, Albedo. Leave it to me. As for the sixth... Let me do it. Since I'm the class representative. And lastly... Subaru. I'll leave it to you. Me? Yes. Wait! There must be someone better than me. Someone stronger than me. That actually goes for me too! Yes, but Subaru... I want you to do it. But still... Just do it! He wouldn't ask you if he didn't think you were capable of it. Don't blame me if I fail! Don't worry, but failure isn't allowed. How am I not supposed to worry? Body of Effulgent Beryl. Penetrate Up. Indomitability. Sensor Boost. Greater Luck. Run Wild Magic Level. Run Wild Magic Range. That should be enough. I prefer to make sure victory is certain before the battle, but... No. The victory is certain. Here I go. Sharks Cyclone! Advance! Tanya, the preparation is done! O Lord, o Lord, that which was spoken. That which was sown. Let there be stones in the way of my enemies. O my Lord. We know it. That which is known. - You're probably wondering why - We know it. That which is known. - I'm praising God when I hate him. - Therefore, let us speak. - I'm praising God when I hate him. - The name that eternity has engraved. - That's right. - Fear! - Same here. - And behold! On Earth is the honor of hosts. The light that pervades the Earth is infinite. - Farewell, everyone. - Blessed are endless. Praise its radiance! But listen! Speak only of the miracles of the Lord. - Pantagruel. - Speak only of the miracles of the Lord. The promised openings are shown to us. - Take care. - The promised openings are shown to us. We worship his zeal. - Yes. - We worship his nourishment. - I'm going. - We worship his nourishment. We only follow that path. Blessed be the path. Blessed be the path! - Is this how you're throwing me? - Blessed be the path! Blessed be the path! It's humiliating that I had to pray to God to activate this power. That's rough, buddy. Now, it's up to them. There she is! Let's do it, everyone! Leave it to me. See? It would've been better if I did it! He just worried about other things. Why?! Splendid. I can't fail here. This is my time to shine. You're starting to sound like Barusu. Dear sister, that's a compliment. The next one is coming from the right. This situation... Isn't it the best time to say that? Okay! Let's go, Black-feathered Lady! Leave it to me! Emilia! We now... Truly are in... Another world! Assemble. Pantagruel, are you okay? I'm... okay... Can I go a little harder? I'm... not... okay! Earth Surge! Subaru, I'm counting on you! Emilia, you put in too much strength! I just have to land her in there, right? My bench press... Probably 90 kilograms right now! Plus, Invisible Providence! For a total of 135 kilograms! What is he saying? I leave it to you now, Pantagruel! This is goodbye. But I have no regrets. It was a short time, but it was fun. It really is. That's the wormhole? Yeah. What's wrong, Kazuma? Nothing. Everyone! The wormhole will soon begin to expand. If we don't get in before it closes, we won't be able to go back. Yeah! We have to go inside to get back, right? Let's hurry in and go back then. - Can we go back to our world with this? - Let's hurry in and go back then. Which world, though? I think it'll probably send us back to school. Yeah, that's what I expected too. You're awake? Where's Pantagruel? Well... Kazuma, where's Pantagruel? About that... Are you sure, Master Naofumi? About what? Shouldn't you say goodbye to them? No need. There's already someone suited for that. You're really staying, Alec? Yeah. I need to stay with her so she won't feel lonely again. Even one person is enough. I see. Subaru, Emilia. I hope your story ended with a happy ending. My name is Alec Hoshin! Hoshin?! The friend of Pantagruel, and pioneer of this wasteland! Like that? Don't tell me, you are... Never mind. Thanks, Alec. Be well! We are loyal soldiers of the Empire. If we see you on Imperial territory, we won't show you any mercy. But it's a shame, yeah, it's really a shame. Every day, we always got sent to the frontline. Where will we be sent to when we return to our original world? Working behind the desk is really a faraway dream. That's why... We'll never see you again since you're in the Unified States. And I'm fine with that. White Silver... So... Well... Hang in there. Yes, thank you, Major Tanya von Degurechaff. You too, Second Lieutenant Vera Metrohina. Ainz. I'm glad I met you. Likewise. I hope you make good friends back home. You too. Me? But I... Lord Ainz. I don't think I can... I mean, the wormhole can't hold on much longer. Yeah, I'm going now. We are going, then. Yeah. Kazuma, Pantagruel will not come out from there? You noticed? I'm not that stupid. Yeah, you aren't. What's wrong, Vera? I'm staying here. I will watch over Pantagruel here. Together with Alec. Vera? Are you sure? Yes. Thank you for everything. Kazuma? What's with that long face? Assemble. What are you saying? By the way, Kazuma. When we left that world, you used Steal, right? He did? And it seems failed. It didn't fail. Are you sure you want to stay here? Yeah. I see. Because... It's lonely all by yourself. That's right! It's lonely all by yourself! Pantagruel? How? I'm a golem, you know. In the end, I'm just a thing. Right before the wormhole closed, the guy in the green cape snatched me from inside. It all worked out. Stupid! Vera, why? Why are you tackling me and calling me stupid? I have to apologize to you for many things. For many things that happened... I'm sorry! Vera. You shouldn't apologize at times like this, you know. Right, Alec? Right. Vera. We only have to say one thing here. Welcome back, Pantagruel. Welcome back, Pantagruel. Alec. Vera. I'm back! In the pale haze, the dawn still blurs my vision Shaking off the noise of days gone by, I looked only ahead Each time we stumbled, we got up Repeated it over and over again, unable to live with grace Fates intersected Just for a moment The melodic road movie is moving With eyes straight ahead, breathing in unison Each one is always shining brightly I'll just keep on believing I chose this path I'll never look back, I will walk until they understand me How can I make them understand? Stronger and stronger, so that I can believe in this path I'm not giving up yet because this is the highlight No one else can aim high Let's start our own music Running through a path called melody Resonate our road movie Knowing that one day we'll have to part Each one is aiming higher Without looking back We just keep going That aside... What are you doing here? They're transfer students. Transfer students, huh? Would you believe it? I transferred in yesterday, and there was nobody here. What are you doing here, though? I don't know what's going on either. So don't worry about it, Boss. Of course, I'm worried about it. Looks like our school life's gonna continue.
