(crowd cheering) - [Narrator] They heyday of the Detroit Sound, epitomized by the chart dominance of Motown Records, has left a lasting legacy on American music and in the hearts of audiences worldwide. Chart topping recordings by performers and songwriters such as Smokey Robinson, Holland-Dozier-Holland, Marvin Gaye, Mary Wells, Martha Reeves, The Supremes, and The Temptations were all instrumental in creating and maintaining Motown's slogan "Hitsville USA". In 1987, 28 years after Berry Gordy founded Motown Records, four of Motown's original stars came together to celebrate the Motown Sound. "Dancing in the Street" captures this remarkable event. It is the last taped concert where Mary Wells, Martha Reeves, Eddie Kendricks, and David Ruffin shared the same stage. Long live the spirit of the Motortown Revue. (crowd cheering) (upbeat music) - How you doing? We're here to celebrate a phenomenon. This is something that is gonna last forever. Between Martha Reeves, David Ruffin, Mary Wells, and Eddie Kendricks, between all of them, this show on this stage has had over 100 hit records. (crowd cheering) Are you ready to dance in the street? (crowd cheering) Right now, ladies and gentlemen, without further ado, can we have a great big hand for the first lady of the Detroit Sound, Miss Mary Wells! - How's everybody doing out there?

Going back to that time of Saul Records, the only entertainer that I ever knew that had a successful record company was the late great Sam Cooke.

Anybody know about the long, cold winter months? (crowd cheering) Is everybody out there from Los Angeles? (crowd cheering) Let me tell you about the long, cold winter months. In Detroit, there was times we couldn't even drive a car through the snow so we bought a lot of records and most of the record sales come from the East Coast because we never can go outside. And we dreamed and dreamed and pushed and pushed and made a lot of dreams come true. There was one group that I loved so much that inspired me a lot that came out with a calypso group by the name of Jerry Butler and the Impressions. (crowd cheering) Now y'all got to sing this one, come on. ♪ She don't love you ♪ ♪ Like I love you ♪ ♪ If she did, she wouldn't break your heart ♪ ♪ She don't love you ♪ ♪ Like I love you ♪ ♪ She's trying to tear us apart ♪ ♪ She don't love you ♪ ♪ Like I love you ♪ ♪ If she did, she wouldn't break your heart ♪ ♪ She don't love you ♪ ♪ Like I love you ♪ ♪ She's trying to tear us apart ♪ ♪ Fare thee well, I know you're leavin' ♪ ♪ Yes, you are ♪ ♪ For the new love that you've found, baby ♪ ♪ That handsome guy that you've been dating, whoa ♪ ♪ I got a feelin' she's gonna put you down ♪ ♪ And when the final act is over, yeah ♪ ♪ And you're left standing there all alone, yeah ♪ ♪ When he takes his bow and makes his exit ♪ ♪ Listen, girl ♪ ♪ I'll be there to take you home ♪ ♪ She don't love you ♪ ♪ Like I love you ♪ ♪ If she did, she wouldn't break your heart ♪ ♪ Just a little bit louder ♪ ♪ She don't love you ♪ ♪ Like I love you ♪ ♪ She's trying to tear us apart ♪ ♪ That's the sound of the men working on the chain gang ♪ ♪ That's the sound of the men working on the chain gang ♪ ♪ You can hear them say it ♪ ♪ Oh yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ One more time ♪ ♪ Little louder ♪ ♪ Oh yeah ♪ ♪ That's the sound of the men working on the chain gang ♪ ♪ That's the sound of the men working on the chain gang ♪ ♪ All day long they work so hard ♪ ♪ Till the sun is goin' down ♪ ♪ Working on the highways and byways ♪ ♪ And wearing, wearing a frown ♪ ♪ You hear them moanin' their lives away ♪ ♪ Then you will hear somebody say ♪ ♪ That's the sound of the men ♪ ♪ What are they doing ♪ ♪ Working on the chain gang ♪ - Come on help me now. ♪ That's the sound of the men ♪ ♪ Lift your voice and say that one more time ♪ ♪ You can hear them say it ♪ ♪ Oh yeah ♪ ♪ Little bit louder ♪ ♪ I can't hear you ♪ ♪ Oh yeah ♪ ♪ That's the sound of the men working on the chain gang ♪ ♪ That's the sound of the men working on the chain gang ♪ - Then came the '60s. I said, "Then came the '60s." (crowd cheering) Let me know y'all with now, come on. And the people that we just did helped pave the way for artists like myself. They came up with a calypso group. And maybe I'm from the church, the only thing I know how to sing was about God. So when I couldn't think of an ad lib, I simply start humming and then I did a little yodel and it got me a Top 10 record and I started off just like this. ♪ Whoa, oh, oh, oh ♪ ♪ Whoa, oh, oh, oh ♪ ♪ Whoa, oh, oh, oh ♪ ♪ Whoa, oh, oh, oh ♪ (crowd cheering) The year 1964 going into '65 was my biggest year in show business. And like all of us who have dreams, I mean, I worked like mad to get what I got and I'm still striving. At the age of 15 to the age of 21 I got my dream and that was becoming a standard act. I call this song the cream of my crop. (crowd cheering) ("My Guy") ♪ There's nothing you could say ♪ I gotta get some ladies to help me sing this. ♪ My guy ♪ Come on, ladies.

This is a very emotional part of our act. 'Cause behind every end there's a beginning. Everybody wants to know about Motown. Motown was first founded in 1959. At the age of 15, I was the only artist on that label for almost two years. And coming from the heart and the soul of the people, the American people, which is the earth of land, I wrote this song. ♪ Well ♪ ♪ You know you took my heart ♪ ♪ And you broke it apart ♪ Come on and move. ♪ Why did our love, baby ♪ ♪ Have to ever start ♪ ♪ You know you took my love, threw it away ♪ ♪ You gonna want, my love someday ♪ ♪ Well, a bye bye, baby ♪ ♪ Well, I thought your love ♪ ♪ Was oh so true ♪ ♪ And you made me, baby ♪ ♪ Yes, you did ♪ ♪ Start loving you ♪ ♪ You know you took my love, threw it away ♪ ♪ You gonna want, my love someday ♪ ♪ Well, a bye bye, baby ♪ ♪ Well, your love was ♪ ♪ Sweeter than any I know ♪ ♪ So don't come back ♪ ♪ Runnin' ♪ ♪ Knockin' on my front door ♪ ♪ Well, you said that I ♪ ♪ You said that I ♪ ♪ Was your only girl ♪ ♪ And there was no others ♪ ♪ Nobody else ♪ ♪ In this whole wide world ♪ ♪ In this whole wide world ♪ ♪ You know you took my love, threw it away ♪ ♪ You gonna want, my love someday ♪ ♪ Well, a bye bye, baby ♪ ♪ Bye bye, baby ♪ - Come on, y'all, put your hands together and clap. ♪ Any I know ♪ - Can I get you to come a little closer? ♪ So don't come back ♪ ♪ Running ♪ ♪ Knockin' on my front door ♪ - The first row, come on up to me. ♪ Hey, hey, hey, I feel all right ♪ ♪ Hey, hey, hey, I feel all right ♪ Let's groove. ♪ Gon' take you higher ♪ ♪ Gon' take you higher ♪ ♪ Gon' take you higher ♪ ♪ Higher ♪ ♪ You make me wanna shout ♪ ♪ Hey, come on and shout ♪ ♪ Everybody shout ♪ ♪ Everybody shout ♪ ♪ Shout, shout ♪ ♪ Shout, shout ♪ ♪ Shout, shout ♪ ♪ All night long ♪ ♪ Bye bye, baby ♪ ♪ Bye bye, baby ♪ ♪ Bye bye, baby ♪ ♪ Bye bye, baby ♪ Thank you so much, I love you.

I can remember my knees shaking and Mickey Stevenson worried if I could do that as well as I typed. We'd like to do it for you.
