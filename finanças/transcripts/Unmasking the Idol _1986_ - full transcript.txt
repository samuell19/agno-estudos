I now have the microcassette in my possession. I should be passing it on to our usual contact momentarily. Outstanding job, as usual. Thank you, sir. There's one other matter I'd like to bring up. I could use a vacation. Whatever you like, Mr. Jax. Enjoy yourself. Just be prepared to start a new assignment the day after tomorrow. Sir, you must be joking. We don't make jokes, Mr. Jax. We're facing... Correction. You're facing the most dangerous mission ever. Time is a big essence. [DEVICE BEEPING] [CHATTERING] CROUPIER: Andre, more chips for Mrs. Stevens. No more bets. Ladies and gentlemen, please no more bets. Number 27, the winner. Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen. Place your bets please. [SPEAKING MANDARIN] Gun can be a very dangerous weapon. Not if you know how to use it. Hmm... True. The usual split bet, sir? Yes. Double 0 and seven. Very good, sir. My name is Jax. Duncan Jax. And you are?China. Of course, you are. I've always been fascinated by a woman with a knowledge of firearms. I only know that mastery takes a lot of target practice. Well, if you want to be an expert, you have to stay on top of things. Double 0, the winner. Should I send this to your room, Mr. Jax? Yes, thank you, Franco. Right away, sir. [CORK POPPING] DUNCAN: I always like to start my day of with a bang. Champagne? You're strong. It's nice to find someone who keeps in shape. I was thinking the same thing of you. What kind of work do you do? A little bit of this, a little bit of that. Sounds evasive. Why all the questions? I like to know the men that I get tangled up with. Are we tangled? We seem to be. Did I miss a step in our relation somewhere? May I ask you something from out of left field? Yes, by all means. And you may answer. And then, you may not. What do you know about the ninja? The what? The ninja. What's a ninja? A paid assassin. You must be talking about that fellow who caused all the commotion in the hotel earlier. Could that have been you? Do I seem like the type to leap from buildings and hang from balloons? You seem like the type to do anything you want. [WHINING] What's that? Must be that ninja you were talking about. It's a baboon. I'd like you to meet the most intelligent primate in the world. His name is Boon. Boon, this is China. [SCREECHING] How do you know this primate? He won't tell. Oh, so you are a ninja. Mum is the word. He's charming. Just like his master. Yes, I can definitely see a resemblance. [IMITATES MONKEY SCREECHING] So, here we are again. Mr. Duncan Jax. Exciting lifestyle, yes? [CHINA SIGHING] Very mysterious. Almost oriental. You're not going to start on that again, are you? Yes. It all seems to fit. [DEVICE BEEPING] Would you excuse me? I have to make a call. [MEN LAUGHING] [CHATTERING] Come on. Come off, monkey. [SPURTING] Look at the monkey. [SCREECHING] STAR ON ANSWERING MACHINE: Hello, this is Star. Unfortunately I'm not here to take your call, but if you leave your name... [SCREECHING] [MEN GROANING] Let's go home, Boon. Home, sweet home. ELECTRONIC VOICE: Good morning, Mr. Jax. I'm R-TECH C7, today's most advance computer, utilizing micro-molecular circuitry. And fully compatible with the most modern of today's defense systems. For a demonstration of my capabilities, please activate my stand-by mode. Oh, and have a nice day. You're a dead man. Can't take us both. And the monkey. Why don't you like Boon, Sato? He always speaks well of you. I don't like monkeys. Except to eat. He hates being called a monkey. Hey, get that pest away from my equipment. No, stop. Stop him. You ask me to drop by and you try to kill me. What's up? Just keeping you on your toes. Looks like you are going down. If I had, I'd be a dead man right now. No thanks to you. How is the R-TECH coming along? Not completely perfected. But very close. Not bad, Sato. I'd like to get one of these installed in the truck as soon as possible. You got it, boss. That would be Star. [DOORBELL BUZZING] Would you show him in, please Sato? Sure. Mr. Jax will be with you in a moment. Thank you, Sato. Good afternoon, Star. If your concentration allows, I think you'll find this both interesting as well as educational. What you will see is the infamous Devil's Crown Island. Most heavily guarded fortress in the world. But no one seems to know why. Oh, you've heard of it then? Yes. An impenetrable hideaway, with enough electronics to spot a flea on an elephant's ass. Don't tell me. You've discovered what's on it. Gold. Tons of pure 24 carat gold. How did it get there? All stolen. Ounce by ounce. Ingot by ingot. Gold jewelry, statuary relics, coins. All hidden somewhere in the heart of that island. Yes, but where? Oh, we know where. Or rather, we know somebody who knows where. Well, sir. Why aren't you talking to him? Because you're the only man who can get in, get the gold and get out. Can't happen. Oh, it can and will. It must be done and soon. There are hostile forces that would use that gold to equip a submarine with nuclear war heads. They threaten to start World War III. [CLICKING TONGUE] What are the details? I mean, if I should decide to go along with it? You'll have help. Beginning with Bugs. Bugs? Why that demo-freak? Because he can lead you to Whale. To Whale? What do we need him for? Because he has the only known map to the gold. You need him. This is turning into a three-ring circus. Bugs can lead you to the prison, where Whale is presently languishing. And Whale can lead us to the gold, and possibly to our deaths. No, no, I don't think I want any part of this. Mr. Jax, Duncan. One more thing. Our sources have confirmed that the organization that supports the Scarlet Leader is responsible for the death of your parents. Namely, Baron Hugo Von Bruger. Goldtooth. Six days you say? STAR: Yes. And Mr. Jax, I'll be going with you. Whatever you like. SCARLET LEADER: I am the Wonder. I am Supreme. I am the Ultimate Power. He who dares to challenge me or defy me shall have to pay the price. And pay for it dearly. I will show no mercy to no one. You catch my drift, old man? So, what have you got to say? Not that I really care. The engine just quit on us. We could have floated around for days. Lucky for us, we washed ashore on this island. I wouldn't call it lucky. You were not invited. So you will have to leave. We don't care for old folks here. Oh, please, we beg you. Let us stay. We have no boats. SCARLET LEADER: Really? Bullets, do you recall the film classic, Kiss of Death? Let's stroll down memory lane with the old lady here. Ah, the memorable staircase sequence. My favorite. [SCREAMING] [SCARLET LEADER LAUGHING] Beautiful. My gosh. What's in that pool? Show him what's in the pool. [LAUGHING] No! Help! My, the piranhas are hungry today. [LAUGHING] [SCREAMING] Good exercise, Gunner. Willy. I was a little off today. You gave it your best shot. For you. [CHATTERING] Willy, come on in. The water's great. I think I'll stay dry and leave the frolicking to you. I'm getting too old for this nonsense. You're not slowing down, are you, Willy? It happens to all of us eventually. Your time will come. There are only two kinds of people. The quick and the dead. And the forgotten. Just remember who was there to show you the ropes when you were coming. Something's eating away at Willy. I think he knows that he's not going to have an active role in this mission. That must be tough to face. Our previous assignment was child's play compared to this one. You sound a little concerned. Are things more serious than I think? Well, they may very well be. These terrorists are both ruthless and cunning. We cannot afford to underestimate them. Duncan, I understand the job. But what about the odds? How can we cut down our losses and still succeed with the mission? Just be quicker and tougher than the Scarlet Leader. Devil's Crown did not get its name from a fairy tale. Is that gold worth the risk? The gold, no. But the elimination of the Scarlet Leader and the Baron makes this a mission that I cannot refuse. There is another bonus. I cannot divulge it at this point, but there is a treasure on Devil's Crown that makes the gold pale by comparison. Scarlet Leader, the huge man with gold teeth who refuses to identify himself has arrived. Ah, it's the Baron. Show him in, but use the service entrance. SCARLET LEADER: My, my... [LAUGHING] Look what the tide dragged in. You're early, Baron. Is something wrong? For your sake, I certainly hope not. I've kept my part of the deal. The gold is ready. I want to see it myself. Immediately. That's your prerogative. But bear one thing in mind, I make the commands on Devil's Crown Island. We have staged a full scale global ransom and you stand on a point of order? Will you please get on with the business at hand? An excellent suggestion. The less I have to work with you, the better. If our organizations weren't working together, I wouldn't be wasting my breath on you. I share the sentiment. And you'll share the riches, when the ransom is paid. Are the missiles operational? They are. And they will be mounted when I deliver the gold. Shall we move on with it? Now, you've seen the gold. Seeing is one thing. Judging quality is another. I assure you, Baron, everything is as we discussed. I've got better things to do than to watch you drool over your treasure. I have not attained my position in the organization by being careless. The gold must be counted and every bar examined before I'm ready to proceed with our bargain. The stakes are too high. I just hope you have not gotten in over your head. And I hope that you are using yours. Should your plan fail, you will find yourself faced with the most formidable enemy. Watch him. We've got ourselves a beauty this time, Sato. A real tough assignment. What is that? Devil's Crown Island. It all starts with a fellow named Bugs. Not one of your favorite people. No. But he's the only one who can lead me to the second man that I need. And that one is in jail. How do you know that? Everybody you need to help you is in jail. Since you seem to know everything, Charlie Chan. Who am I talking about? Whale, of course. You're right, Sato. It is Whale. But all I know about him is that he's locked up in a Caribbean prison. And he has no intention of ever leaving. Yeah, I can get to him through Bugs. So, he is my first target. [MAN 1 SINGING] [PEOPLE CHATTERING] [MAN 2 YELLING] [GLASS SHATTERING] Bugs is really living stylishly these days, huh? God, I'd say so. You can bet these beauties in the car are armed to the teeth. Bugs may be crazy, but he's not stupid. How are we going to get passed those guys? I think Boon may be able to solve that problem for us. You call this monkey business? WOMAN: Look at the monkey, it's dressed up in a Ninja suit. MAN: No, that's the Leibowitz kid, he looks like that. WOMAN: No, come on. [COUGHING] MAN: Come on. Out of the car, out of the car. What do you want? I want to see Bugs.Who are you? An old friend. He doesn't have any old friends. This old friend could mean millions to him. Ah, that old friend. What the hell... Where is he? He's... He's back there. Through the first door, second on the right. [GROANS] [DOOR BUZZING] It looks like trouble. [SIGHING] Well, things are getting a little tighter than we expected, Duncan. Looks like things are going to get even tighter. Puts a little excitement in your life, don't you think? Duncan, this is serious. What're we going to do? Do you have any religious affiliations? [DEVICE BEEPING] Sato... SATO: What's up, boss? We're in a bit of a squeeze here. Duncan, I... Sato, the walls are closing in on us. We need a miracle. Try the tiny wrench on your wrist band. It's a torch substitute. GUNNER: Duncan! GUNNER: Duncan! [BOON GIBBERING] [LAUGHING] [GUN FIRING] Duncan, you should have made an appointment. We would have, but we were pressed for time. I don't believe it. This place looks like a war zone. GUNNER: I've never seen anything like this. It's unreal. I'm a collector. This is probably the largest privately owned collection of arms in the world. Can we pass on the tour and get down to business? Okay. But I hope we're talking serious business here. I like a man who gets to the point. I'll be brief. We're talking about gold. Lots of gold. So why me? You don't look like a tooth fairy. Look, if I didn't need you, I wouldn't be here. Your share is 20 percent of mine. I only work for 50. This is not negotiable. You're in or out? Well, it depends. What's the target? Devil's Crown. Devil's Crown? On or off, what do you say? Time's running out. Well, what's my part? Two-fold. First, you lead us to the Whale. Now, I know you're crazy. Who the hell wants to deal with the Whale? Secondly, you apply your specialty. Demolition. We also need you to fly the chopper. Okay. I'm in. [CLANKING] What the... Say, does that ape have a search warrant? Hey, monkey. Monkey! Don't worry about him. He's just playing. Well, that stuff he's playing with makes nitro look like a fire cracker. Boon! Leave it. We go in for the Whale tomorrow. Whale don't plan on going anywhere. He likes it there. I think I might be able to persuade him. Good luck! [GROANING] MAN 1: There, a monkey. Monkey. MAN 2: Monkey up there. MAN 3: Hey, where you going? Tequila. He wants tequila.MAN 2: Oh, he's smiling at us. [MEN CHATTERING] MAN 1: Yeah, he looks like he's not going to leave you with that. [LAUGHING] [MEN CHATTERING] Hold it there. Let's talk, uh? You pose a formidable problem. You ain't seen nothing yet. Who the hell are you? What are you doing here? I'm a man with a mission, and I need your help. Well, why didn't you just walk in and ask, instead of creeping up on me like that? If I had asked, you would have helped? No. Why waste words? Now, I'm telling you. Let's go. We have work to do. Why should I leave all this? Just because you tell me to? You're wasting time. I'll try to tell you about it. MAN: Go monkey. Hey, monkey. So, you give me the map and you get to stay here. What's your name? Jax. Duncan Jax. Well, Duncan Jax. You don't look so stupid. But you sound real stupid. No one has ever seen such a map. I believe you're just like the others. You're following a blind lead. You got it and I want it. With you or without you. Whoever told you such a stupid story about a map? Bugs. Bugs? How do you know that little sleaze-bag? He's sending you all his best. He's waiting for you right outside. No, no, you don't listen so good. I told you, I don't know anything about a map and I'm not going anywhere. Somewhere in your brains or on your body, there is a map. Wherever it is, I'll find it. Well, Duncan Jax. I'll make you a bargain. You want me out? You carry me out. Never gets any easier, does it? What... What is this? It means we're going steady, uh? It means we're going. Now. We are? Oh. What the hell is? A multiple personality module, commonly referred to as a bomb. It's a bomb? Well, what the hell. Let's go, eh? DUNCAN ON RADIO: It's Christmas, Boon. Ho, ho, ho! Time to pass out the presents. Be generous. MAN: Throw it. Come on, come on. [ALARM BLARING] [BOMBS EXPLODING] Come on! Come on! ECHO ON RADIO: This is Echo, can you read me? [RADIO STATIC BUZZING] This is Echo, can you read me? This is Echo... I read you Echo. You're coming in faint, but I read you. Can you speak louder? There isn't much time. The soldiers will be arriving at 0700. The gold will be loaded quickly. DUNCAN: Where will the gold be loaded? The dock side pick-up port. It's marked on the map that you have. That's all I can tell you. I have to go now. There's one more thing I have to know. It's important. I can't depend on the Whale. I have to know the exact location of the tunnel entrance. I've tried. I'm afraid they'll catch me if I pry any more. We need that information. You've got to try again. It's vital to the success of this mission. [GASPS] Echo? Echo, can you read me? DUNCAN: I trust you all found enough to eat. I wanted us to get a chance to know each other. Who's on what side. Well, I like our team a lot. If the bad guys are this pretty, I might forget my mission. You better hope they're not this tough. Well, if this is the last supper, I want to make it memorable. I don't mean to put a damper on these things, but if you have any questions about your assignments, now might be the time. I'd like to make one thing clear. We're not going in for the gold. Hold on there. I'm going in for the gold and there's no doubt about it. Now, just let me finish. I didn't say that we wouldn't take the gold. It's how we take it that counts. I'm for brute force. It works every time. That's not the plan. Whale has a map. Excuse me, but we still have a little matter of percentages to discuss, Duncan Jax. On his person, Whale has a map that can lead us to the real gold. Meanwhile, we deliver the false gold to Goldtooth at the dock side pick-up vault. Why bother? Our responsibility is to destroy the nest of terrorists, along with Goldtooth and the submarine. The gold is just the frosting on the cake. Some frosting, eh? Duncan's right. Our assignment is to rid the world of this threat. We'll take the gold as our reward. We hit Devil's Crown in three days. The plan says four. Now, it's three. Also, there'll be no further communication from this compound. I don't want any leaks. You don't trust your own people? I didn't mention the word trust, Willy. It's just a precaution. An attack is imminent. We don't know the precise location or time, but we do know who, and you know as well, don't you? [LAUGHING] Yes, you do, my pretty little Echo. We're waiting for a man that many people consider the most dangerous Ninja on the face of the earth. Aside from myself, of course. [LAUGHING] [ECHO WHIMPERING] But you knew that too, didn't you? [ECHO SCREAMING] You would know it because you've been passing information to our enemy all along. And we know what happens to bad little girls like you. Don't we, my darling Echo? Tell me, Echo. Do you like water sports? Yeah... Good. My informant tells me that Duncan Jax has enlisted the services of that slobbering blimp that escaped my torture several years ago. The Whale. [LAUGHING] You see, I still have my informant. Duncan Jax has lost his. [SCREAMING] I haven't had this much fun in years. Boy, he's strict. Yeah. [LAUGHING] But this mission's been planned so carefully. How could anything go wrong this late in the proceedings? DUNCAN: All I know is there's a traitor in our midst. We have an agent who is in contact with Devil's Crown. They are expecting an assault before the sub arrives in four days. That's why you upped the schedule and shut off outside communications. What's your next move? Nothing. We wait until they reveal themselves. Whoever they are, they're bound to be getting edgy. Sooner or later, they're going to slip up. When they do, it won't go unnoticed. Why are you so hot to get me into a chess game, Sato? Because I think I can trap you this time. I've never lost to you yet. What makes this time different? SATO: Information. Knowledge of how that game is played. You've been taking lessons, Sato? What could you know now that you didn't know before? SATO: New facts. Certain moves I had not known before. And... How did you come by these new facts? By keeping my eyes open. By watching the moves of others. What others? Nobody plays like I do. That's true. You have your own moves. And it seems, your own rules too. Meaning? Meaning, when things don't go your way, you make them to suit yourself. If you have something to say, Sato, this might be just the right time to get it off your chest. Well, I've been wondering about the transmission you sent out this afternoon. The one right after the briefing meeting. I'm sorry that I have taken your time to discuss Willy this morning. I must admit that it is a surprise and a disappointment to me. Forget the previous briefing and listen carefully to what I am going to tell you. Make sure you understand every detail. I will lead the Red Team. Ours will be the first assault group. Red Team landing will follow a diversionary drop by approximately one minute. Yellow Team. Your landing will follow within one minute later. You'll land on the north beach and cut your way to the middle of the island. At the same time, White Team will land with the Red on the east beach. There, you will split off and make your way across the island to the west beach, arriving in time for the cargo drop. All of you will be given detailed plans and maps of your exact landing locations. Any questions? Any questions? Later, Boon. Mr. Jax, may I? DUNCAN: Certainly, sir. Oh! If you've ever believed that timing is everything, believe it now. If you're late, others could be killed because of you and you could be killed because you've let down others who could have protected you. DUNCAN: Boon! Are you chewing gum? Order is as follows, one, diversionary forces on the west beach. Two, Red and White Teams land on the east beach. Three, White Team to the north beach. Four, Cargo to the west beach. Okay. That's it. Study your plans carefully and destroy them. We leave at 0400 sharp. Unit one covering the entire western section. This is unit one calling command post central. Come in, command post central. Over. I read you, unit one. Over. No sign of any invasionary force. CENTRAL: We have an invasionary force coming in from the west. All units stand by for further instructions. There they are. Parachute drop. Call for reinforcements. Send more units. All forces to the west beach. Let's give them a welcome they'll never forget. Yes, Scarlet Leader. They're all dummies. We've been tricked. UNIT ONE: Scarlet Leader, what shall we do? Our men are dropping like flies. Well, you fool, get more flies. Scarlet Leader, our units report that Duncan Jax is flying in. [BOTH GROANING] [SHOUTING] [NINJAS SHOUTING] All units, they've just dropped a... I can't believe it. Go! Go! [SHOUTS] This is it, Bugs. Time for you to earn your share. You don't worry about me. I know what I'm doing. Damn well better. I don't like working with amateurs. Well, now, Mr. Big Deal, seems like you don't have much of a choice, do you? No, but I can lessen the odds, and if you make one slightest mistake, I'll blow your little bugs right off. Boy, I should have stayed in prison. It was safer there. What, and miss all the fun? [PANTING] Okay, Whale. This is it. Up till now, you've refused to tell us where the map is. Where is it? Can't you give me a moment? We're rapidly running out of time, my friend. I don't care if it's in your brain, in your belly, or tattooed on your butt. I want that map now. You're serious. DUNCAN: Serious like a heart attack. What's this? That's it, Duncan Jax. It's an electronic map. If you press the proper sequence of buttons, you will learn the precise location of the tunnel entrance. But remember, without me, this map is of no use to you. And without the map... Come. [GROANING] [NINJAS GRUNTING] Let's go. I don't know why my apprehension seems to be growing the deeper we get into this mission. Ah, it's simple. You're used to others doing your dirty work, while you're sittin' in your office, giving orders. What the hell do you know about me? I can smell people like you. Let me tell you one thing. We're in the field now, old buddy. I didn't earn my stripes sitting behind a desk, Bugs. I know the field as well as anyone. We'll soon see. This is the easy part. The ass kicking comes later. If the computer is correct, we should be very near the pit opening. Why do you need a map? You spent a lot of time on this island. This is very true, Duncan Jax. But you see, I was designing a weapon system. The information I have stored on the computer, is just little bits and pieces I picked up here and there. Strictly on the sly. Whale, there's something I've always wondered about. Where did you hide the map before your escape? Please. This is not something I wish to discuss in the presence of a young lady. Come. You see, our little computer lead us right to it. [EXCLAIMING IN DISGUST] What's that awful smell? I could tell you, but I don't think you really want to know. Okay, Whale. Once we are in the pit, which way do we go? When we reach the first platform, we take a right. That should lead us directly to a set of stairs. [LAUGHING] If you turn left, I think we're going to find out what that terrible smell is. We'll go to the right. It's going to get hot in here pretty soon. We don't have much time to get our rigged gold in with the genuine article. It'll only take a second. I must say, Bugs. You do know your job. Well, I've been around. Let's go. Let's get the show on the road. Hey, does this mean, animals and ladies first, eh? This is no time for chivalry. Go! Go! How close are we? Any signal yet from the radio station? Sparks, any signal yet? No, Captain. Nothing. Why the hell not? What is going on? SPARKS: What? Who is this? "Who is this?" I will tell you who this is. This is the man who will turn your inside out if you don't get someone to that radio, is that clear? Yes, sir. He's only used to taking my command. Starting now, he will take mine. He can only do what his equipment will allow him to do. He can do what I tell him to do, is that clear? Spats, Sparks, or whatever your name is, get talking on that radio. Looks good to me. Everything is just as we found it. If you got the grate back up on the door, we can go. I've got one last charge to take care of. Why must I do everything? I can't stand incompetence. They are not answering. I think your generator is out. We can't go in there blind. I hate these subs. Let me see. What in the hell is going on here? I'm surrounded by idiots and incompetence. Where the hell is Goldtooth? Follow me to the communication's room. What a world. What a world. Now, what you see? It looks like a war zone out there. Sparks, any message yet? SPARKS: Still, nothing, sir. What's the good of having a damn radio if it doesn't work? It does work.If it works, we should be talking to someone now. It doesn't work. It doesn't work. We're not going in there. We are going in now. Understood? Take it in. Now! Oh, boy, I can smell the gold already. [SIGHS] It doesn't work. I don't know, it could be the battery. Right. What do you suggest we do now? Hey, that's one smart monkey you got there. So this is the throne room! DUNCAN: My God, the throne. I know the treasure is here somewhere. But where? Are you saying the gold is not treasure enough? It could be enough. But there's more. Much more. GUNNER: I should have known. Come on, we've got a lot to do. Let's get going. Call the guards. I want a complete search made everywhere. Calling all guards. Calling all guards. Be on the lookout for trespassing ninjas. These blasted balloons should have been here by now. I wish they damn well hurry up and get here. What's to keep the guards from firing at us when they arrive? Well, it beats the hell out of me. Tell them to hurry. Why is it taking so much time? They're loading the gold as fast as they can. Well, it's not fast enough. I want to be out of here in 10 minutes. I'll try. Don't try. Just do it. [GROWLING] You know, Duncan, it might make it easier if we knew what we are looking for. I can't tell you exactly. I'm working on pretty sketchy information. Well, give us at least that much. All right. If greed and power were the motivating factors behind the Scarlet Leader's gold web, and I figured he'd want something for himself, after the gold was picked up. Yeah. You can't run this place on bread crumbs. Makes sense that there is more stashed here than we know about. Well, what is it? A golden idol. An idol? We're looking for an idol? What kind of idol? I'm not sure. I only know that it does exist. [NINJAS GRUNTING] [MEN GROANING] We're running out of time. Let's keep looking. [SIGHS] But we've looked everywhere. Obviously, we haven't looked everywhere. I know it's in this room. Somewhere. This is been missing for centuries. It's breathtaking. I've never seen anything like it. Of course you have. Look at me, eh? [DEVICE BEEPING] Star, Bugs, this is Duncan. We found it. DUNCAN ON RADIO: Listen. I am feeding the information into your navigational system. Proceed immediately. Let's go. What's going on up there? I want some information. Where are these mysterious warriors? Find them. There they are in the throne room. They got the golden Buddha. Bring me Duncan Jax and his mangy monkey too. After them. Hurry up, you swines. What are you doing, Duncan? God damn! Here is the real treasure. Get this thing out of here. I'll bring the rest. DUNCAN: Boon! All right, Duncan Jax. No more Mr. Nice Guy. All right, you two, head for the clearing, the police should be there now. Don't worry about me. We'll be right behind you.
