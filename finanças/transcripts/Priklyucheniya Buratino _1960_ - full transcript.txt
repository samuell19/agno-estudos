Riff-raff! Turn to the left and look at this man. This is a former organ-grinder Carlo. This man is very dangerous to our tribe. What makes him so dangerous to us? The fact that he seldom eats and when he does eat, he finishes everything to the last crumb. So there's nothing left for us here. That's not true! That's not true, that's not true! He is cooking something tasty for us. It's boiling, it's boiling! Look at you, so scared! This cauldron will not boil in a thousand years. Oh, it's not real. Oh, it's a painting. Don't be upset, little one. I will take you now to Giuseppe the carpenter, They call him the Purple Nose! To Giuseppe's, to Giuseppe's! To the Purple Nose! To Giuseppe's! Heh, not bad. It can be turned into... a table leg. Ouch! Not so hard, please. What's going on? I must have imagined it. Ah! It tickles! Cheese! Shh! Don't rush! First we have to find out how much he has drunk. What's going on? There's no one in the chimney either. My ears must be ringing. No no. No, I know my ears. They never ring after just one drink. Let's wait until he has had three. There. There. Here we go. Oh! The organ-grinder! Hello, neighbor. Why are you sitting on the floor? - Uh, I lost a screw. - Oh, I see. How are things with you, old friend? Things are bad. I can't think of any way to make a living. What could be easier? There, take this log. Why do I need it for? I don't even have a fireplace. You can make a puppet out of this log. Teach it to sing and dance and take it door to door. You'll make so much money- enough for a piece of bread and a glass of wine. A wonderful idea! Well, give me the log. Here- No, take it yourself. Take the log, don't be afraid. Let's drink to your success. Well, thank you, neighbor. Goodbye. Come again? I said, see you later. To this wonderful solution! And I thought I'd solved my problems! - Was it tasty? - It was! See? Not like at the organ-grinder's! There. There. Like this... and like that. No, not good. Too long. If you don't stick it in other people's business it will be no worse than the shortest of noses. What should I call him? Ah, I got it. I will call him Bu-ra-ti-no. - Bu-bu-ra. - ?h! It's speaking! Bu-ra-ti-no. Bu-ra-ti-no. Bu-ra-ti-no. There. There. Let's see. There. Well well. Let's see how well you can stand. No more jumping! I won't sell you. You will live with me and go to school. When you finish school you can do whatever you want. Can I do whatever I want now? What is it you want? I want... not to go to school! Don't be silly, Buratino. I'll be right back. You think about what I said. Think about what Papa Carlo said. Who are you? I am the Talking Cricket. I've been living in this room for more than a hundred years. Now I am the master here. Get out of here! Well well well... I'm so hungry! Oh, what is this? What's there? - "Don't stick your nose in other people's business!", - What did Papa Carlo say? Why are you still here? Naughty mice! Where did they steal that egg from? Excuse me, my mommy's waiting for me. Here he is. Papa Carlo! ?h, where's your jacket? It's all right, it's all right. I can do without. Look, I bought you an alphabet book and... an onion! There you are. Eat it. Eat your dinner and go to bed. In the morning you'll go to school. Run, or you'll be late. Good morning, signore! Good morning, signora! Oh! Excuse me, signore, which way to the school? Excuse me, signore, are you sure, it's to the right? Signorina Little Girl, when does the first class start? In five minutes. There? Here? There? Here? I have time! Hurry! Only one show! Full of surprises! Hurry! Hurry! The famous puppet theater of the famous Doctor of Puppet Science and closest friend of the King of Tarabar - Signore Karabas Barabas! Hurry! Hurry! How much is the entrance ticket? Four coins. Could you lend me four coins? I forgot my purse at home. Do you take me for a fool? Then I will sell you my wonderful jacket for four coins. There are no fools here. Then my cap. I am no fool. In that case, I will sell you my new alphabet book for four coins. Does it have pictures? Wonderful pictures and large letters. I'll take it, I guess. Give me a ticket for the front row! And now we will perform for you a merry comedy titles "?alvina, of Thirty-Three Blows to the Head". and all 33 will be dealt to me. The strikes will be given to you? Yes, to me, to me, to me. Do you want fewer strikes? Of course. But how is that possible? Very simple! ?! Now there are only 32 strikes left. Why are you whimpering, stupid? Because I want to get married. So why aren't you getting married? I will tell you everything. Lost is Malvina, my beautiful bride. She ran away to a faraway land. I weep, I don't know what to do with myself. Perhaps I should end it My sad puppet's life... You broke my wand! Don't worry, don't worry! Here, now you have two wands. Look! It's Buratino! It's a real Buratino! Little bird was polka-dancing On the meadow in the morn. Nose to the left, tail to the right - That's Polka Karabas. Nose to the left, tail to the right - That's Polka Karabas. Karabas Barabas! So it's you who interrupted my show? No. Go on with the play! Lost is Malvina, my beautiful bride. She ran away To a faraway land... What shall I do to you? I'll decide after dinner. Do you know on whose nail you're hanging? I don't know. Before, the beautiful Malvina used to hang on that nail. Where is she hanging now? Alas, probably nowhere. Because of the rudeness of our director, she gave up the stage. I say, some director you have! Hey, who's there? Bring to me the good-for-nothing Buratino! He is made out of dry wood. I will throw him in the fire and my roast will be ready in no time! Have mercy! I swear by my beard, that nosy piece of wood will burn nicely! Come along. Come, dear, climb into the fireplace! Signore, I cannot do that. Why is that? Signore, I've already tried once to stick my nose into the fireplace, but I only made a hole in it. Nonsense! It's impossible to make a hole in a fireplace with your nose. It's possible, if the fireplace is in a painting. In a painting? Painted on a piece of old canvas. My darling, darling Buratino, where did you see the painting of a fireplace? In my Papa Carlo's hovel. - ?h?! So it is in the old organ-grinder's hovel- that's where there's a secret... A secret what? A secret what? A secret... All right! I'll spare your life! That's not all. Give these to Papa Carlo and ask him to make timely payments for his hovel and not to move anywhere. Go on! Thank you, signore! You couldn't have given this money to anyone more trustworthy. The secret of the magic door will be revealed soon! There is some kind of secret here! A secret. A secret. A secret... Alms for the blind! Alms for the blind! Psst, someone's coming. Alms for the blind! Where are you going in such a hurry, Buratino? Home, to Papa Carlo. The old man is completely broke. What about this? What are you going to do with this money, huh? I will buy a jacket for Papa Carlo and an alphabet book for myself. An alphabet book! It will get you into trouble! An alphabet book, ha! By the time I got to the letter S I'd lost my sight. Liars. Liars. I'll get you! Why are you picking on the crow? Was that a crow? Ay-ay-ay. I'm so blind, I thought that was a dog sitting in the tree. My smart, sensible little Buratino! Would you like to have ten times more money? How do I do that? Let me tell you. There is a Land of Fools. In the Land of Fools, there is a Field of Wonders. Shh, don't tell him. Let's go. We'll trick him! Dig a hole in that field... say: "Kreks pheks peks" three times... Say what? - Kreks pheks peks. - Uh-huh. Breks pheks peks. Keep talking. He's right there. - Put a gold coin in the hole... - Right, a gold coin. - ... pour salt on it.... - Right, right, some salt. Then what? - ... and go to sleep. In the morning, a tree will grow on that spot with gold coins instead of leaves. - You're lying. - I swear it's true. He's calling us liars. Let's go. No, don't go. I believe you. Where is it, this Land of Fools? There, beyond that forest. All right! They're liars. They're liars. Get away. Let's go. Breks pheks peks. No. No, it's Breks peks pheks. Get him! Get him! Grab him! Give us your purse or die! Where is your money? Your money, scoundrel! That's where his money is! The money is in his mouth! I can't see anything. Me neither. Shoot! Did I hit anything? You did. Grab him! Stop! Get him! Get him! Get him! Get him! Get him! Get him! Catch him! - Open the door! Bandits are chasing me! What nonsense! - ?h?! There's no escape! No escape! Well, my friend, hang until morning. They will fall out of you by morning! What if they fall out and roll away? They won't roll away! Good night, my friend. We'll see you tomorrow! Artemon, look. Good morning! Glad to be of service! Artemon, fetch a doctor! Homeopathic surgeon, Professor Owl. Member of the Academy of Science, Nurse Frog. Praying Mantis the Healer. I don't have a diploma, but I can heal better than them. Hmm, the patient is more dead than alive. No, the patient is more alive than dead. Two possibilities: the patient is either alive or dead. If he is dead, he either can be revived or cannot be revived. Quackery! Such ignorance! Well, what should I give him? Cua-cua-cuastor oil. Not 'cuastor oil.' Castor oil. Either give him castor oil or don't. It's better to die from an illness than from castor oil. In that case, go wash your hands, brush your teeth, and we'll have breakfast. Let's have breakfast first and wash up and brush our teeth after. No no no. Artemon, take Buratino to the water pump. We're too late! What do we do now? Let's go talk to the mouse. Are you crazy? What does a cat have in common with a mouse? You fool! To a flying mouse- the bat! You can't drink from the spout! Eating jam with your hands! But I washed them! Get up from the table immediately and wash your hands! Again? Yes yes yes. And then I will start teaching you. What did I get myself into? Here, jump up! Buratino.... Let's start with mathematics. You have two apples in your pocket. You're lying. I don't have any apples. Let's assume that you have two apples. Someone took one apple from you. How many apples do you have left? Two. Think. Mm, two! Why? I'm not going to give my apple to this 'someone', even if he fights for it! Oh, you have no talent for math. Let's try writing instead. You're a naughty boy! You must be punished! Artemon! take Buratino to the dark closet. I won't go! I don't want to go! I don't want to! I never realized, how hard it is to teach boys! - Wait for midnight,.. - ... Buratino. I will take you to the Land of Fools. There you will find your friends the Cat and the Fox, joy and happiness. Wait for midnight! Wait for midnight! - Three, four, five. I will wait for you on the lawn. - Mmm. Aha! Follow me! I brought him! Where am I? You are in the right place! You're in the Land of Fools. Land of Fools. Look! They are rich because they sowed their money in the Field of Wonders. - ?h, I'll go sow my money too! - Go to the right! - Yes, sir! - Go to the left! - Yes, sir! - Go straight! - Break up! The governor and his wife. The chief of police. Detectives! - Let's go! - Quickly! This is it- the Field of Wonders. Dig a hole and put your coins in it. And don't forget to put salt on them. - No, I won't do it while you're here. - I would never? - We would never? - We wouldn't even think of looking! - Breks pheks keks. - Why doesn't he leave? - Shh! It's not growing. Ah! I probably put too little salt on them! - Chief of police! Let's go! What? - I have information. - About whom? - About him. - Breks pheks keks. Peks breks pheks. - We suspect... - Suspect what? - ... that someone is plotting... - Plotting what? ... an assassination! Whose assassination? - Yours! You can't even be a proper informant! How quickly you regained consciousness! Such courage! Such composure! Take him! Grab him! Drown him! I'm innocent! They're here! Dig dig dig! We got the money! You'll never be an Olympic champion! Get away from me! Bravo to the champion! Oh, gracious stranger, you made me a champion, and I would like to thank you. I am a miserable failure. Oh my poor Papa Carlo! I thank you, gracious stranger! Here he is, the noble and unhappy stranger, kind Tortilla the Turtle. Listen to me carefully. One day a bearded man dropped this key into the water. He didn't notice anything and kept going. This small key is made of gold... It's a very special key. It was in my pond before, Now you must unlock the door. What door? That is only known to the bearded man. I've swallowed so much slime. Well, Foxy, now we can drop by the inn, right? - That's a suspicious sound! - Let's check it out! - A ghost! - A ghost! - Pierrot! - Buratino! - How did you get here? - ?h, I'm looking for Malvina. What's going on at the theater? - This morning our director fell ill. Great! Great but not so great. Duremar cured him. Who is that? The seller of medicinal leeches. He sent some leeches to Karabas Barabas and one leech got so drunk from all the blood that she started talking too much. What did it say? That in the pond of Tortilla the Turtle there lies the golden key. What if Tortilla refuses to give us the key? This way, quickly! If she refuses to give us the key, I will fish out all of her leeches. You are a true friend, Duremar! Glad to be of service, Karabas Barabas. If Karabas Barabas gets the golden key... Look here? Here it is! How terrible! He must have been eaten by rats! Look whom I brought. Teach him all you want. - ?h, I'm so happy! Boys, go wash up and brush your teeth immediately. Left, right, left. I told you she was cuckoo! - Aw, I look awful from all the crying. - ?at something, please. - Oh, I don't eat anymore. I write poetry instead. In that case, read us some poems. "Lost is Malvina, my beautiful bride She ran away to a faraway land. I weep, I don't know what to do with myself perhaps I should end it..." ?! I heard with my own ears that the kind Tortilla the Turtle, fearing for her life, told Karabas to whom she gave the golden key. - Artemon! Pack our things immediately! We are fleeing! Don't forget to take some soap. - Oh! Here you are, my little ones! Get them! Get them! ?h! - Pierrot, take Malvina and run to the lake! ?rtemon! Prepare to fight! - Give back the key! I won't! I won't! - Give back the key! I won't! I won't! - Take that! Give me back my beard! You can't catch me, you can't catch me! You can't catch me! - Where are they hiding? "Lost is Malvina, my beautiful bride. She ran away to a faraway land. I weep, I don't know, what to do with myself, Perhaps I should end it My sad..." Ah, you're alive! I'm so happy! You're alive! You're alive! Well, boys, since you're alive, go wash your hands. Well, let's wash up. I promised a good reward to the Fox and the Cat if they capture Buratino. I will take the golden key from him! First you need to eat something. I agree. Let's have dinner and then start searching! - Where are you going? - I want to find out, which door may be unlocked with the golden key. - Have a treat, Signore Commander-in-Chief! Signore Commander-in-Chief, I must enter the inn unnoticed. Let me hide behind your splendid tail. - Out, you old cooked meat! What are you laughing at? Your wine is a garbage! Why don't you pour me some from that jug? Signore, that jug is empty. In that case, we will throw bones into the jug. - After I finish this leg, I will go looking for Buratino. Oh really! He won't get away alive! Reveal the secret.., you miserable wretch! The secret! What-what-what secret? The secret of Tortilla the Turtle! - God save me! - Where is the door? The door is in the old Carlo's hovel, behind the painted fireplace. - He's here. Come on. Everything is all right. The rooster said that Buratino went in there. But the rooster doesn't know where he's hiding. Don't worry, we'll find him! I will use the fact that he has a kind heart. Ahem, five minutes ago the governor arrested Pierrot, Malvina and Artemon. - ?h! - Where is Buratino? - Where is the money? - The money! Here! He will appear before you now. One, two, three... voila! Get him! Catch him! Now run for your life, old ground meat! Go, go, Faster! Faster, faster, faster! - Come, come to me, little ones! - Don't move! If we must die, let's die like heroes! Pierrot, play something happy! - Oh! They're teasing me! Hooray! We won! Get him! Hooray! We won! My son! Buratino! You naughty boy! You're alive and well! I'm going to complain to the mayor! Good boy, Artemon! Help! Help a poor orphan! Who is picking on you, orphan? - Carlo the organ-grinder! - What? I can't hear you? - Carlo the organ-grinder. - ?h?. Follow the orphan and help him! Now! We're going to Carlo the organ-grinder's. We'll capture Carlo the organ-grinder. - Artemon, rip off the canvas! That's Buratino! Buratino! Buratino! In the name of the King of Tarabar, open up! In the name of the King of Tarabar, break down the door! - Quickly! - Help! - ?h! - Hello, Buratino! - Hello, Talking Cricket! Forgive me for the past. The past can be atoned for in the present. Don't waste time and wind the clock. - Well, look at this? Now we will have our own theater and Karabas Barabas will die from jealousy! - Damn you, Buratino! Artistic Director: Papa Carlo?! So that's how it is! Little bird was polka-dancing on the meadow... Karabas Barabas! Little bird was polka-dancing On the meadow in the morn. Nose to the left, tail to the right - That's Polka Karabas. Nose to the left, tail to the right - That's Polka Karabas. Little bird was dancing polka Because it was happy. Nose to the left, tail to the right What a merry polka! Nose to the left, tail to the right What a merry polka! What an old fool I am! Why did I give away such a wonderful log?
