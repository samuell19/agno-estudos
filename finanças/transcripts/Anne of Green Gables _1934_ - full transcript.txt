[melancholic music] [music continues] [birds chirping] [knock on door] Look, Diana, quick. 'Isn't that Matthew Cuthbert?' (Diana) 'Yes, mother. Why are you so surprised?' Where can he be going? Never goes to town this time of year. He never visits. Maybe he's just taking a drive. Matthew Cuthbert wouldn't dress up for that. Well, he isn't driving fast enough to be going for a doctor. I'm clean puzzled I won't have a moments peace of mind until I find out from his sister, Marilla. (Diana) 'Can I go with you, mother?' No, when you're through with the flowers you can get to your churning. [knock on door] Come in. Good morning, Marilla. Good morning, Rachel. And how is everyone at Barry's home? Oh, we're all pretty well. I was kind of afraid you weren't though. Especially when I saw your brother riding by today. Thought maybe he was going to the doctors. Matthew's gone to Bright River. We're getting a little boy from an orphanage in Nova Scotia. And he's coming on the train this afternoon. A boy? Marilla! You and Matthew Cuthbert adopting a boy from an orphan asylum? Well, the world is certainly turning upside down. I'll be surprised at nothing after this. Nothing! What on earth put such a notion into your head? Well, Matthew is getting on in years. You know he's 60. And he isn't so spry as he once was. His heart troubles him a good deal. And you know how desperate hard it is to get hired help. Can I get you a cup of tea? Now, how can anybody drink tea when they're so excited they're about ready to burst. How'd you know the boy was coming? Well, we had a telegram from Mrs. Spencer. Saying she'd drop the boy off at Bright River Station on her way to White Sands, Matthew's gone to meet him. Well, Marilla. You know, I pride myself on speaking my mind. Now that it's all clear to me, I'll just tell you plain I think you're doing a mighty risky thing. Now, only last week I read in the paper where a man and his wife took a boy out of an orphanage he set fire to the house. Set it on purpose. And in the case of New Brunswick where an orphan asylum child put tyricten in the well and the whole family died in fearful agony. Well, it was a girl in that instance. Well, we're not getting a girl. [birds chirping] [train horn blaring] How are you, Angus? Was that the 1:35 that just left? Yup, you're a bit late. Passenger dropped off for you, Matthew. That's what I've come for. I asked her to go to the depot. She told me she preferred to stay outside. - Her? She? - Yeah. Said she wouldn't go inside because there's no scope for the imagination. But we're not expecting a girl. It's a boy I've come for. [laughing] She won't have any trouble explaining. She's got a tongue of her own. [train horn blaring] I suppose you're Mr. Matthew Cuthbert. My name is Anne Shirley. Anne spelled with an "E." I was so afraid you weren't coming for me and I was imagining all the things that could've happened to prevent you. You're sure there isn't some mistake? Well, you're Mr. Matthew Cuthbert aren't you? Yes. Well, if you're Mr. Matthew Cuthbert there can't be no mistake. Mrs. Spencer told me to wait right here for you. Oh, I can carry it. It isn't heavy. And if it isn't carried a certain way the handle falls off. So you better let me do it 'cause I know the exact knack of it. Oh, I must have lost the knack. Well, don't you think we better be going? I guess it'll be alright. [horse trotting] We've got to drive a long pace yet, haven't we? Oh, I'm glad 'cause I love driving. Oh, it seems so wonderful that I'm going to live with you and belong to you. Well, as I was saying I never really belonged to anyone before. Just to the asylum. And that was worse than anything you can imagine. Mrs. Spencer said it was wicked of me to talk like that. But I don't mean to be wicked. Am I talking too much? Oh, you can talk as much as you like. I don't mind. Oh, I know you and I are going to get along just wonderfully. Oh, I just love this place already. I've always heard that Prince Edward Island was the most beautiful place in the world. I used to imagine that I was living here. But I never really expected that I would. Do you imagine much? Well...no. At the asylum I used to imagine all kinds of things. Why, sometimes I'd imagine that perhaps the girl who sat next to me was really the daughter of a belted earl who had been stolen away from her parents in infancy by a cruel nurse who had died before she could confess. [horse trotting] Isn't this beautiful? What did that tree all white and lacy make you think off? Well, now, I don't know. Why, a bride of course. A bride in white with a lovely misty veil. Just now I feel pretty nearly perfectly happy. I can't feel exactly perfectly happy because.. Well, what color would you call this? - It's red, isn't it? - Yes, it's red. And that's why I can't feel perfectly happy. I know I'm skinny and a wee bit freckled and my eyes are green. But I can imagine I have a beautiful rose leaf complexion and lovely starry violet eyes. But I cannot imagine my red hair away. I do my best but it's no use. It will be my life long sorrow. I read of a girl once in a novel who was divinely beautiful. Have you ever imagined what it must be like to be divinely beautiful? - Well, now. No, I haven't. - Oh, I have often. Which would you rather be, angelically good or dazzlingly clever or just divinely beautiful? Well, now.. ...I don't exactly know. Anyhow, we're getting thy home. [birds chirping] Whoa. - That's the house. - Why, it has gables. - What do you call it? - Oh, just a house. What would you think if I gave it a new name? Something that would sound more euphonious. Now, let me see. Gables and they are green. Green Gable! I think that's nice. From now on that's what we'll call it. Green Gables. Oh, it's too beautiful to be true. I know I shall live here until I grow to be a real old lady with grey hair. I'm overwhelmed. Marilla. - Marilla, this is-- - How do you do? Matthew Cuthbert, who's that? - I wanted to tell you-- - Where's the boy? That's what I wanted to tell you. 'The station master at Bright River--' (Marilla) Never mind him. Where's the boy? There wasn't any boy. There was only her. We sent word to Mrs. Spencer to bring a boy. Well, she didn't. She only brought her. So I figured she couldn't be left there no matter what the mistake was. You beget a pretty kettle of fish. This is what comes of sending word instead of going ourselves. You don't want me? You don' want me because I'm not a boy. Well, nobody ever did want me. I might've known it was all too beautiful to last. Well, don't cry about it. I'm not crying, only.. This is the most tragical thing that's ever happened to me. What's your name? Will you please call me Cordelia? Call you Cordelia? Don't you think it's a pretty name? Is that your name? Well, no, it isn't exactly my name. But, oh, I would love to be called Cordelia. (Marilla) 'I don't know what on earth you mean.' It's such a perfectly elegant name. Don't you think? If Cordelia isn't you name, what is it? Anne Shirley. Isn't that an unromantic name? No, Anne is a good, plain, sensible name. 'You've no need to be ashamed of it.' Oh, I'm not ashamed of it. Only I like Cordelia better. You know, I've always imagined I should've been named Cordelia. Oh! Well, if you're going to call me Anne please spell it with an "E." What difference does it make how it's spelled? Oh, it makes a lot of difference when you print out Ann it looks dreadful but Anne with an "E" looks distinguished. So if you'll only call me Anne with an "E". I'll try and reconcile myself to it. Very well. Anne with an "E". How did you happen to be brought instead of a boy? If I were very beautiful and had nut brown hair would you keep me? No, a girl would be of no use to us but don't stand there gaping. Come along. Bring your bag. Now you're here, I suppose we'll have to put you some where. Now...take your hat off. You'll have to have some supper of course. Oh, I can't eat. I can never eat when I'm in the depths of despair. Depths of despair! Can you eat when you're that way? I've never been that way. Well, can't you even imagine you're in the depths of despair? No, I can't. Here's your room for the night. Wash up. - Come down for supper. - Yes, ma'am. Tomorrow, I'm going to find out who's responsible for all this rigmaroling. I'll drive over and see Mrs. Spencer. That's certain. This girl has got to go back to the asylum tomorrow. I suppose so. You suppose so? Don't you know it? (Matthew) 'Well now, she's a real nice little thing, Marilla.' 'It's kind of a pity to send her back' 'when she's so set on stayin' here.' Matthew Cuthbert, I believe that child has bewitched you. I can see as plain as plain you wanna keep her. You should've heard her talking coming from the station. I don't like children who have so much to say. As far as I'm concerned it's a closed book. I can hire a boy to help me. And she'd be company for you. I'm not suffering for company. And she's going right back where she came from. [birds chirping] Look out for my feet. Hurry, child. I was just taking a farewell look at the place. You see in the years to come I want to look back upon Green Gables as a beautiful dream. That I hope will always haunt me. Don't you think that-- You can think about it on the road. Never mind that now. Goodbye, Mr. Cuthbert. I shall never forget your kindness. Goodbye. Giddy up! Matthew, don't forget to take the butter out of the churn. And be sure you close the gate to the pasture. 'If Mrs. Barry comes over, return that sugar I borrowed.' But, my dear Mrs. Spencer I can't understand how such a mistake could happen. There's no harm done, Ms. Cuthbert. I'm sure Mrs. Blewett will take her. Mama, Mrs. Spencer's here with another lady. Good morning. This is Ms. Cuthbert, Mrs. Blewett. - Good day. - Hello. And this is the girl I told you about. Come in. I got a stew on the fire. I'll be right back. (Mrs. Spencer) 'Sit down, Ms. Cuthbert.' I still can't understand how it happened. How ever in the world you made such a mistake? I understand how you feel about it. 'That's why I brought you here.' 'It can all be straightened out.' 'I'm sure Mrs. Blewett will take her in.' 'She's so anxious to get anyone to help with the children.' I'm sorry to keep you waiting, Mrs. Spencer. So much to do. - What's your name? - Anne Shirley. - How old are you? - Fourteen. Well, there ain't much to you but you look wiery. 'You know with what your kind, you're the best after all.' If I take you, you'll have to be a good girl. You know, good, and smart and respectful. Now, I'd expect you to earn your keep? No mistake about that. Well, I suppose I might as well take her off your hands right now. Well, I don't know. I think I better take her home again and talk it over with Matthew. I oughtn't to do anything without consulting him. (Marilla) 'If we make up our minds not to keep her' 'I'll bring or send her back tomorrow.' Will that be alright, Mrs. Blewett? Well, I suppose it'll have to be. Good day. [baby crying] I wouldn't give a dog I like to that Blewett woman. Matthew, aren't you gonna say anything? I wish you were more like other men who would talk things out. Probably you'd answer back then, argue you into reasoning. What's to be done with men who just look? Here's you night gown. - Thank you. It's-- - Get into it. Don't forget to say your prayers. (Anne) 'Do you think they're essential?' Why, what do you mean? Weren't you taught to say you prayers? 'Well, I used to at the asylum Sunday school.' 'but week days I'm afraid I was just too tired.' Well.. ...you will say your prayers while you're under my roof. Why, of course, if you want me too. Kneel down. Now, that's the part I never could understand. Why must people kneel down to pray? Now, if I really wanted to pray I'd go out into a great big field all alone. And then I'd look up at the sky. The beautiful sky that looks as if there was no end to its blueness. I'd imagine it was a dome of a great cathedral or the canopy of heaven. And then I'd just feel a prayer. Well, what am I to say? Well, Anne I think you're big enough to pray for yourself. Just thank God for his blessings. And ask him humbly for the things you want. Well, I'll try and do my best. Gracious heavenly father, I thank thee for everything. As for the things I especially want, they're so numerous it would take a great deal of time to name them. So I'll only mention the two most important. Please, let me stay here. And please make me beautiful when I grow up. I remain yours respectfully, Anne Shirley. There, did I do alright? Yes. - Goodnight, Anne. - Goodnight. Oh, Ms. Cuthbert. I just remembered, I should've said amen instead of yours respectfully, shouldn't I? Do you suppose it will make any difference? No. I don't suppose it will. Come on, child. Finish your breakfast. Oh, I'm all finished. Why, you haven't eaten anything. Won't you tell me if you're going to send me back? I've tried to be patient all morning but I just can't bear it any longer. Please, tell me. Go tidy your room and dress your best. But it's all tidy and this is my best. Then go wash your hands and hurry. I just saw Mrs. Barry coming up the path and I want you to look your nicest. - Good morning, Marilla. - Come in, Rachel. Thank you. I do hope everything's alright so far. It's a great responsibility you've taken on yourself. There's no telling how a child like that will turn out. I don't want to discourage you. I'm not feeling discouraged. I suppose you want to see Anne? - Anne? A girl? - Yes, a girl. Anne. Anne Shirley. This is Mrs. Barry. How do you do? Well, they didn't pick you for looks. Bit skinny. And awful heart, did anyone ever see such hair! - Red as carrots. - How dare you say I'm skinny? 'And how dare you say I'm red headed?' You're an impolite, rude, unfeeling woman. - And I hate you! - Anne! How would you like to have nasty things said about you? How would you like to be told that your ugly and-and your gossipy and your sour as an old crab apple? Anne! Anne Shirley! Well, I don't envy you. Your job of bringing that up! You shouldn't have twitted her about her looks, Rachel. - Marilla Cuthbert. - I'm not trying to excuse her. But we must make allowances. Perhaps she hasn't been taught what's right. And you were hard on her, Rachel. I see, I have to be very careful about what I say after this. Orphans brought from goodness knows where seem to be considered before anything else. Well, if you take my advice, and I don't suppose you will you'll do the talking to her with a good-sized birch switch. Goodbye, Marilla. Come down to see me as often as you can. But don't expect me to visit here again if I'm to be sworn at and insulted in such a fashion. Goodbye, Rachel. [sobbing] That was a nice way for you to behave. And of all people you would pick on Rachel Barry. She hadn't any right to call me skinny and red headed. Rachel may have been too out spoken. But she's your elder, a stranger and my visitor. Three very good reasons why you should've been respectful. She deserves an apology and you'll go to her and say you're sorry. I could never do that. You can punish me in any way you like. You can shut me up in the dark dungeon inhabited by snakes and toads. And-and you can feed me on bread and water and I shall not complain. Oh, but I cannot ask Mrs. Barry to forgive me. If you expect to remain under my roof you will apologize to Mrs. Barry. Then I'll leave now. Send me back to the orphanage. I'll never tell Mrs. Barry that I'm sorry. - Sounds as if she meant it. - Oh, she's determined alright. Well, maybe it's best. I have a feeling we would never like her. Matthew Cuthbert, don't form opinions for me. I never said I do or don't like her. When the time comes, I'll speak my own mind. [sobbing] Thank you, Mr. Cuthbert. Well, I see you're leaving. How could I remain here after all those things Mrs. Barry said about me? I can see that. And I'll never say I'm sorry because I'm not. I can't even imagine I'm sorry. Marilla thinks it's best you're going back. And I don't know but what she's right. It's kind of a lonely place for a little girl here. No other children, you know? And well, after all, you're used to the orphanage. 'And all your old friends are there.' 'I guess you'd like it better.' Of course, if you'd rather stay around here you can always go to Mrs. Blewett. - 'She'd, uh--' - Mr. Cuthbert-- 'Of course, I might be able to see you sometimes.' But perhaps well I guess you'd better go back to the orphanage. Mr. Cuthbert, suppose I change my mind? What about Mrs. Barry? You know Marilla's a dreadfully determined woman. I'd just rather die than tell Mrs. Barry I'm sorry. Don't you think you'd better do it and get it over with? You know, you don't have to be exactly sorry. 'You can be sort of sorry.' 'And that would kind of smooth it over.' Well, if you really want me too. Well, I've been thinking, Anne. It would be terribly lonesome downstairs without you. - It seems that the sooner-- - I'll do it. You go back downstairs and I'll come down and tell Ms. Cuthbert that I've repented. Good. Now, don't you tell her that I said anything about it. She might think that I was interfering. And that'd spoil the whole thing. It'll be just our secret, hm? Wild horses couldn't drag the secret from me. How could wild horses drag a secret from anybody? Ms. Cuthbert. What is it? I'm sorry I lost my temper and said those rude things and and I'm willing to go and tell Mrs. Barry so. Very well, go get your hat, I'll take you there at once. Yes, um.. I knew if we left her alone, she'd come to her senses. Matthew Cuthbert, you must admit I have a way about things. [birds chirping] Go in the house, Diana. What is about to happen may not be for your ears. - Oh, mother. - Go on in. Mrs. Barry, I'm extremely sorry I behaved so terribly. I should never have disgraced the dear friends who have let me stay at Green Gables even though I'm not a boy. I'm a dreadfully, wicked, ungrateful girl. And I deserve to be punished and cast out by respectable people forever. Every word you said was true. My hair is red and I am skinny and ugly. What I said about you was true too but I shouldn't have said it. Oh, please, Mrs. Barry. Please, please, forgive me. If you refuse it would be a life long sorrow to me. You wouldn't want to inflict a life long sorrow on a poor little orphan, would you? Oh, I'm sure you wouldn't. Oh, Mrs. Barry, please say you'll forgive me. There, there, get up, child. Of course I forgive you. I guess I was a little hard on you. But you mustn't mind me. And don't worry about your hair. 'I knew a girl once her hair was every bit' 'as red as yours when she was young.' 'When she grew up, it darkened to a real handsome auburn.' You've given me hope. I shall always feel that you're a benefactor. [Diana laughing] Come here, dear. - Yes, mother? - This is my little girl, Diana. - This is Anne Shirley. - Anne spelled with an "E". - Hello. - Hello. Diana, you may take Anne out to the garden and show her the flowers. Oh, I'd just love that. Alright. Come on. Matthew and I were thinking that though we haven't exactly decided to keep her she ought to go to school. I'll be glad to have Diana pick her up in the morning. Well, you wash dishes pretty well. Oh, I'm better at looking after children though. I had so much experience at the orphanage. It's such a pity you haven't any here for me to look after. I don't feel as if I wanted any more children to look after than I've got at present. You're problem enough in all conscience. What's to be done with you I don't know. That Matthew is the most aggravating man. Oh, I think your brother's lovely I felt he was a kindred spirit as soon as ever I saw him. Well, you're both odd enough, if that's what you mean. Now, don't get it into your head we've definitely decided to keep you. 'In the meantime your schooling mustn't be neglected.' 'Diana will be here any minute now to take you.' I'll try to be good in school. Of course, it will be uphill work. Remember, behavior is as important as fine marks. I'm expecting both from you. What am I to call you? Shall I always say, Miss Cuthbert? 'Or may I call you Aunt Marilla?' No, you can call me just plain Marilla. I'm not used to being called Miss Cuthbert. It will make me nervous. Oh, but I'd love to call you Aunt Marilla. I'm not your aunt and I don't believe in calling people names that don't belong to them. But you could imagine you were my aunt. I could not. Don't you ever imagine things differently from what they really are? No, I never imagine things differently from what they really are. Oh, Marilla, how much you miss. [chuckles] What's your name? My name is Anne Shirley, Anne spelt with an "E". We pride ourselves on our scholastic record. And we hope that you will-- Oh, I'm sure I will, Mr. Philips. You see, my father was a teacher and my mother was a teacher. And so that gives us something in common, don't you think? You will share the desk with Diana Barry. Thank you, Mr. Phillips. Diana's my bosom friend. (Mr. Philips) 'Never mind that, I'll get your history later.' I can tell you that right now. 'I was fourteen years old last March and I was born in Halifax' my father's name was Walter Shirley and my mother's name was Bertha Shirley. Aren't those lovely names? Oh, I'm so glad that my parents had names that were real nice. It would be such a disgrace to have a father named, say.. ...Hezekiah. It doesn't matter what a person's name is as long as he behaves himself. Well, I don't know. I read in a book once that a rose by any other name would smell as sweet but I've never been able to believe it. I don't think a rose would be as nice if it's called a thistle or a skunk-cabbage. Will you please take your seat with Diana? Yes, sir. (Mr. Philips) 'Now we will resume our geography lesson' where we left off yesterday. And I want you to pay particular attention. That's Gilbert Blythe. Don't you think he's handsome? (Mr. Philips) 'Serbia, which is bounded on the north' 'by Austria, Hungary..' '...on the east by Romania and Bulgaria..' '...on the south by Greece..' '...and on the west by Bosnia, Montenegro and Albania.' 'Alice Wainwright, what is the capital of Serbia?' (Alice) 'Belgrade is the capital of Serbia.' [whispering] Carrots. Carrots! - You mean, hateful boy! - Ow! How dare you? Well, Anne Shirley, I must say this is very nice behavior of your first day in school. It was my fault, Mr. Phillips. I teased her. I'm used to the eccentricities of Gilbert Blythe. But I'm sorry to see a new pupil display such temper. Come up to the platform. Face the class. [indistinct chattering] Anne.. ...you will write that 100 times. 'School's dismissed.' [indistinct chattering] I'm awful sorry I made fun of your hair. Oh, honest, I am. That's the first time I ever heard Gilbert Blythe apologize for anything. You should be angry with him for making fun of your hair. He called me toe-head. There's a great difference between being called a toe-head and being called carrots. I shall never forgive him. Gilbert Blythe has hurt my feelings excruciatingly. - Anne! - Yes, ma'am? Never mind appearing so innocent. I've heard all about it and your first day at school-- - But, Marilla-- - Don't you dare stop me. I'm so ashamed of you I don't know where to begin. What do you mean breaking slates over other students' heads? He called me carrots. I don't care what he called you. You had no right to lose your temper. He hadn't any right to say it. And I think that Gilbert Blythe is a.. - Who did you say it was? - Gilbert Blythe. Did you...smash your slate? Yes. Well, go upstairs and get ready for supper. Run along, you must be starved. (Anne) 'That's what I couldn't understand, I thought Marilla' would give me a tanning or at least a talking-to. But she didn't even give me a tug at the ear. I should have told you Marilla doesn't like Gilbert. It isn't his fault either. It's his father's. Why, Diana, what do you mean? Well, one night when mother thought I was asleep I heard her talking to Mrs. Blair. It was something about Gilbert's father running away with the girl that was to marry Matthew. And mother said Matthew was never the same after that. Marilla didn't get married either because she thought it was her duty to take care of Matthew. Diana, this is terribly interesting. What else did they say? Mrs. Blair said, that Gilbert isn't even allowed to set foot on the Cuthbert property. I'm gonna find out more about this. Warm day, isn't it? Not too warm to do your churning. Marilla, would you mind if I asked you sort of a personal question? What is it? Well, are you sure you're not harboring any ill feeling against me because I broke my slate over Gilbert Blythe's head? You probably had just cause. Do you think it's nice to invite Diana here to do your work? Run along now. I'm gonna try Matthew. [birds chirping] And so poor Juliet died and so did Romeo. Now wasn't that sad? - Yes. - Just think of it. The both of them dead in the full bloom of youth. All because two families fought with each other. You don't think people act that way today, do you? Anne, when you get as old as I am.. ...you'll know the world hasn't changed very much. Did you know that I hit Gilbert Blythe over the head with my slate? I heard something about it. You know, I like that story about Romeo and Juliet. Do you know any up-to-date stories like that, Mr. Cuthbert? No, and if I were you.. ...I wouldn't tell the ones you imagine around here.. ...especially to Marilla. Oh, I won't if you don't want me to. But I'd sort of like to know why? Well, Marilla doesn't believe in stories. Is that the only reason? It's getting kind of late, Anne. I think we'd better start for the house. Love, marriage, friendship, courtship, hate. - Love, marr-- - Ssh! Marilla! - Good morning, Marilla. - Morning, Diana. Marilla, you look perfectly scrumptious. Well, you wouldn't expect anybody would go to the Ladies Aid in their kitchen clothes, would you? Someday I'm going to have a brooch like that. Oh, I think amethysts are lovely. That's what I used to imagine diamonds were like.. ...such lovely, glimmering purple stones. Marilla, would it be asking too much if someday you granted me the privilege of wearing it for just an hour? We'll see. Oh, I should love to see it on my green brocade with the rippling flounce. Why don't you wear it on your foulard? The one with the big white spots on it. Well, don't you think it would look nicer on my Taffeta? What are you two babbling about? Diana and I've been imagining what we should wear on the hay ride. 'Of course, it wouldn't really matter' 'what the dress was made of as long as' 'it had puffed sleeves.' 'Don't you think puffed sleeves would be beautiful, Diana?' Stop chattering and run along to school. 'Matthew, get my lunch basket.' Oh, Marilla, may I tell Mr. Phillips I'm going on the hay ride? I'll think about it when the time comes. Bye, Marilla. Bye, Matthew. (Diana) 'Is Marilla going with you on the hay ride?' - I don't suppose so. - Matthew? I think he would if I asked him. If you hadn't fought with Gilbert he might have taken you. What makes you think he wouldn't now? 'All I have to do is wave my little finger' 'at Gilbert Blythe. and he'll come up begging.' Psst! - Where's Marilla? - In her room. Here, open this up. I'll keep watch. Puffed sleeves. For the first time in my life I've run out of words. I just don't know how to thank you. (Marilla) 'Anne!' - 'Anne Shirley!' - Yes, ma'am. Have you seen my amethyst brooch? - Why, yes-- - Did you touch it? Why, yes, I just pinned it on to see how it looked. What right did you've to meddle with my brooch? Where'd you put it? I put it right back up on the bureau. Honest, Marilla, I didn't mean to meddle. And I promise I'll never do it again. You know, that's one good thing about me. I never do the same wrong thing twice. Anne, the brooch is gone! 'You were the last person to handle it.' Now, tell me the truth. Did you take it out and lose it? No, I didn't. Anne Shirley, you're telling a falsehood! Now go to your room. And you'll stay there until you confess even if it takes a month of Sundays. If you'll just let me out for the hay ride I'll stay in my room as long as you like cheerfully. But I've just got to go to the hay ride. You'll go to no hay rides nor anywhere else until you tell me the truth! The youngster ought to be made to eat something. Matthew, I've been telling it was no use. I've taken two tray's up to her she wouldn't touch a thing. All I could get out of her is "I'm too overwhelmed to think of eating." Would you mind if I tried to get her to take something? And you've been up in your room all this time? How much longer do you think it will be? Forever. Don't you see, Diana? I can't have Marilla believe I took that brooch. Then you won't be able to go on the hay ride. Will you? That's what makes me grieve. I so wanted to go. Oh, I wouldn't be too upset about it. Anyway, I heard that Gilbert's going to take Alice Wainwright. I'd like to go, if for no other reason, then to show you I can make Gilbert Blythe eat right out of my hand. Marilla, I'm ready to confess. I expected you'd be, come downstairs and let me hear what you have to say. I took the amethyst brooch. I didn't mean to, but it was so beautiful. I was overcome with irresistible temptation. I was imagining I was Lady Cordelia Fitzgerald. And it was so much easier to imagine I was Lady Cordelia if I have the amethyst brooch on. Then I strolled through lover's lane. And when I got to the bridge, I took it off to have another look at it. 'Then I leaned over to see my reflection' 'in the Lake of the shining waters.' And the brooch slipped through my fingers. And went down, down, down. And sank from sight forever. And that's the best I can do with confessing, Marilla. Now, may I go on the hay ride? No. But you promised I could if I confessed. You're not going on the hay ride and that's final. Mrs. Barry was right. She warned me from the first. - I should have known-- - 'Marilla!' Anne.. ...what did you mean by saying you took it and lost it? Well, you said you'd keep me in my room till I confess. So, I just thought of a confession and made it as interesting as I could. [accordion music] [indistinct chattering] Now you just watch. [indistinct chattering] Good evening, Mr. Blythe. Hey, Joe, hold this for me, will you? I'm ready to forgive you. [music continues] - Oh, hello, Diana. - Hello, Gilbert. Say, where have you been? I thought you'd never get here. Why don't you sit right up here? I can now sit beside you. Alrighty. [chattering continues] (Gilbert) 'We all here?' (Diana) 'Come on, Anne.' [music continues] Good morning, Miss Shirley. Have a good time on the hay ride? You're not angry, are you? I would appreciate it exceedingly, Mr. Blythe if you would stop annoying me. Aw, let's forget it, Anne. I only took her-- Oh, I wouldn't have gone with you anyway. Furthermore, I promised myself never to speak to you again. Let's call it quits, huh? It is impolite to pass a person without at least nodding. So from now on, I'm merely nodding to you. Why don't you come off your high horse? If I tolerate you at all, Mr. Blythe it's because you're a character. - I'm a what? - A character. I don't understand you. Well, if you must know, Mr. Phillips is a character. And Matthew is a character. And you're a character. I think you read too much. Please let me go. I'll be late. Will you let me walk home with you, after school? I should say not. One of these days, you'll be glad to have me for a beau. I have a beau. Oh, and he's a character too? No. I like him. Well then, then, why wasn't he on the hayride? He's too grown-up for such things. (Mr. Phillips) '"The results of the annual essay contest' '"among the junior students of the Prince of Wales College' "'were announced yesterday.' First honors were given to Herbert Root." I've just been reading from a newspaper article about one of my former pupils who incidentally was never tardy. This former pupil of mine, Herbert Root, has just won 'the junior student's prize in an essay contest.' 'I read further from the article.' '"Young Root surprised the committee' '"by the depth of his thesis.' '"He took for his subject the Tennyson classic' '""The Lady of Shalott."' 'His thesis was awarded first prize by unanimous vote."' 'Naturally, I'm proud that young Root' 'was a product of this school.' 'And I can only hope that from this year's class' 'may spring a pupil just as brilliant.' Guess what I'm going to get mother for her birthday? - A new apron. - A comb for her hair. A new centerpiece for the corner table. - That's beautiful. - What color? It's gonna be bright red-petal flowers and butterflies on it.. I'll make Mr. Phillips forget all about Herbert Root when I get to Shalott town. I think Herbert is the smartest boy on Prince Edward Island. How do you happen to know? I said Herbert Root is the smartest boy on the island. And you, Gilbert Blythe, are annoyingly inquisitive. Anybody think you know Herby? Wouldn't you be surprised if I told you that we've corresponded for a long, long time? As a matter of fact, Gilbert Blythe Herbert Root was to have taken me on the hayride. Only he couldn't get here in time. - He what? - Why, Anne, really? How long have you known him? [indistinct chatter] [bell dings] My dear pupils, last week I discussed with you a young man of whom I'm very proud. Herbert Root. Herbert, we're all happy to have you here today. 'And would you be so good' 'as to say a few words to the class?' Of course. My success in the main, Mr. Phillips 'was due to your teaching.' 'I held before me constantly' the text of many of your lectures. To wit that no definite rules are necessary for fine writing. I chose my subject, "The Lady of Shalott." Because it presented an interesting problem an unrequited love. There was no question in my mind with what the Lady of Shalott loved Lancelot. But there was a question in my mind as to whether he even knew her. Hence, I placed particular emphasis on that portion of the poem. From the time she decided to lie down in death on the boat to Lancelot's memorable line "She has a lovely face," etcetera, "The Lady of Shalott." And, uh, that's how I won the contest. (Mr. Phillips) 'Thank you, Herbert.' 'And now, my pupils, I will declare a short recess.' 'But you may meet Herbert and ask him any questions.' [indistinct chatter] Aren't you gonna speak to him? Or you just gonna correspond with him? (Diana) 'Go on, Anne.' [indistinct chatter] The handwriting, the fine use of words. I should like to have a copy of your essay, Herbert. - I would prize it. - Certainly, Mr. Phillips. Hello. Hello. How do you do? [laughs] [instrumental music] Something wrong, Anne? I've come to the conclusion that a good imagination is a bad thing. And there's no romance in the world. No. You mustn't think that way. There is such a thing as romance. If it ever comes near me, I'll let it pass right by. I'll give it up. No. Don't ever give it all up, Anne. A little of it is a good thing. Not too much, of course. But keep a little of it. Just...a little. [music continues] "Down she came and found a boat "beneath the willow, left afloat. "And round about the prow she wrote The Lady of Shalott." [music continues] [music continues] "And at the closing of the day "she loosed the chain and down she lay. "The broad stream bore her far away. "The Lady of Shalott. "And ere she reached upon the tide. "The first house by the water-side. "Singing in her song, she died. The Lady of Shalott." [dramatic music] [music continues] Hang on, Anne. Don't be afraid now. - Don't let go. - I won't. Give me your hand. [grunts] Give me the other hand. Ugh! Let me get your foot over the limb. There. - Oh, it's you. - Yes, ma'am. And I bet you're glad I'm here too. I'm overwhelmingly grateful to you, Mr. Gilbert Blythe. And I thank you very kindly. That I saved your life too. I'm a hero. A real hero would guard such a secret to his dying moment. And he'd never breathe a word of it. Not to anybody. Oh, I wouldn't tell. You know, I wouldn't. You swear on your word of honor? Cross my heart. This must remain our very own secret. No, I've reconsidered. We can never have a secret because you hurt my feelings excruciatingly. You made fun of my hair. Uh, that's because I...I just couldn't keep my eyes off it. It was kinda nice lookin' at it. Only I, when I tried to tell you about it I guess I didn't say it right. Why, Gilbert Blythe, you really mean that? - Mm-hmm. - Then, I shall relent. After all, you did save my life. You are entitled to a reward. And I shall kiss you. - You don't claim your reward? - Yes, I do. Anne I...I want you to be my girl. (Gilbert) 'You know, I've always liked you. That's why I teased you.' Then why did you take Alice Wainwright on the hayride? Anne, you got a memory like an elephant. Why can't you forget a thing that happened over a year ago? Why should I? You hurt me terribly. Well, you were gonna wrap me around your little finger. Did Diana tell you that? - Nope...honest. - Then, how do you know? I've never told you this before. But I can see things ahead. Long before they've happened. I'm a mind reader. You're an eavesdropper. - Will I see you tonight? - Why ask me? You're the mind reader. [instrumental music] (Gilbert) 'Hello, Anne.' Why, I thought I'd never get away. Gee, you're brave meeting me here. I wonder what would happen if Marilla ever found out. Let's hope she never does. I wouldn't know what to do. I got something for you. Close your eyes. Hold out your hands. - A locket. - Uh-huh. I've always wanted one. Oh, Gilbert! I bought it at the Jim Lawsons. And it's guaranteed not to turn green. It's beautiful. But how can I ever-- Don't worry about it. You can wear it out when you're not around Marilla and Matthew. You can tuck it in when you're home. - Happy birthday. - Thank you, Anne. Oh, gee, they're swell. If it weren't so cold, I'd put them on right now. I finished them last night. - What was that? - Nothing. I think I'd better run back. Goodbye, sweetheart. That's the first time you've ever called me that. Do you mind? I've been wanting you to for three years. Kissing, Anne Shirley kissing. Anne Shirley kissing that Blythe boy. Mrs. Barry saw it with her own two eyes. She rushed right up here to tell me. Why don't you say something, Matthew Cuthbert? - Well, that's interesting. - Interesting? You should be ashamed of yourself sitting there and taking it so casual-like. - Well, they're just youngsters. - 'Youngsters fiddlesticks!' 'I'd wager that they've been meeting in that that place' for heaven knows how long. And you'd probably known it all along. No, Marilla. I've never been down near that tree. How do you know it was by a tree? A person can imagine things. You stop acting so innocent-like. Well, after all, Marilla.. ...you know a body can only be young once. And Anne-- You stop protecting her. That girl's an ingrate. After all we've done for her. To take up with Gilbert Blythe. 'The one person...his father..' Anne Shirley, when we took you in. - I never would have dreamed-- - 'Now, Marilla.' You keep your all out of this, Matthew. You know what I'm talking about. And you know what we think of Gilbert Blythe. Please, Marilla. Why must you say things that.. Wait, Marilla, I don't see any use in trying to make matters worse. Anne...I don't wanna hurt you 'by referring to what I consider your indebtedness to us.' 'But I want you to promise me' 'you'll never see Gilbert Blythe again.' Please, Marilla. (Marilla) 'I'll not leave this room' 'until I hear you say you'll not see him again.' This tree is the dividing line between the Blythe and Cuthbert properties. And I never thought I'd live to see the day when I would be compelled to cross it. I have come to talk to you about Anne. It's high time somebody did. Don't think I've had my eyes shut and my ears closed all along. And don't think I'm going to let that girl go on sacrificing herself and suffering for it. - But, Miss Cuthbert, I-- - This much you ought to know. Anne's not a child. She knows what she owes us. And she knows what her responsibilities are. That girl has ambitions to make something of herself. She's going to normal school as soon as she's ready and she can't let anything stand in her way. Why...I wouldn't stand in her way for anything in the world. No friend of hers would. No friend of hers would even try to see her anymore. As far as Anne is concerned all this fool carrying on was a mistake. And it's gotta stop. Stop right now. [instrumental music] Tell him he doesn't understand. Tell him I'll see him the first minute that I can steal away. Won't be any use. He was all packed up when he wrote the note. 'Just told me to bring it to you.' 'I asked him where he was goin' but he wouldn't tell me.' [instrumental music] There. That oughta hold it for the trip. There's no call for you to be looking like a lost cat. You're just fixin' to make it harder for everyone. I'm fixin' to do anything to solve? I've seen lots of people go away in trains in my life time. What makes your nose so red and twitchy then? Well, that's a frost bitten nose. Got a right to look red and twitch too. I don't like people who get emotional over nothing. Anne...hurry up. Expect that train to wait for you? (Anne) 'I'm coming.' What gave you the idea that schooling was goin' to pinch us? I never said any such thing. Then don't even think it. Fine thing that would be for Anne to get a window. No, you mustn't come with me. I've already asked Cathy Grant to drive me to the station. I couldn't bear to say goodbye to you in front of all those people. I might cry. Getting emotional over nothing. Nothing? Why you've been angels to me? You're both such darlings and, and you're never.. I've just got to kiss you. Folderol...kissing. Might as well kiss him too, I suppose. I can't help thinking.. ...I wish she'd always stayed a little girl. Nobody can deny she's real tall and stylish. Nobody. Nobody at all. She's smart, too. And pretty. And loving. You know, Matthew? I get afraid when I think of it. She'll be away so long. And get terrible lonesome. That was a lucky mistake, Mrs. Spencer. When she didn't bring us a boy. Who want a boy? Nobody. I certainly didn't. Nor I. So you see it wasn't luck that brought her here. It was providence. We needed her. Even with all her odd ways? I...loved her for 'em. Who said they were odd ways? Nobody. I certainly didn't. Diana. Oh, how glad I am to see you. Well, turn around and let me look at you. You've grown so.. Oh, Anne. And you've become prettier. And you're a married woman. Tell me. Are you very happy and very much in love? Yes, Anne. Very much. How wonderful that must be. To think of him all the time and know that he's thinking of you. And nobody can interfere. That must be happiness. Oh, Anne. Someday, you and Gilbert will.. He's back. Did you know he was studying medicine? Yes, I know. At least, I thought he would. You never hear from him? Doctor Tatum says that when Gilbert graduates he's going to make him his assistance. Please, Diana. Let's not talk of Gilbert. - I'm still your bosom friend. - But I.. Tell me about everybody. Did you see Matthew and Marilla before you left? (Diana) 'Yes, but I only stayed a few minutes.' 'Matthew is pretty sick to be bothered with visitors.' Matthew's sick? Oh, Anne. I am sorry. I, I thought you knew. I should have known when he didn't write. That's why it was always Marilla. I must get back to Green Gables. But how can you leave now? Your final examinations are just two weeks off. I can't help that. I'd never forgive myself if anything happened to-- But you've worked so hard and now you're going to throw it all away. They need me. [horse galloping] [knock on door] - Why, Anne. - Marilla. - Anne, why did you come-- - How's Matthew? May I see him? Not now, dear. Doctor Tatum's with him. Oh, I'm sorry you found out. Matthew didn't want you to know he.. ...he said it might upset your school work. Well...Anne Shirley. How are you? Fine, thanks, Doctor Tatum. May I see Matthew? Better not disturb him now. You see, he's, he's just dozed off to sleep. And if you waken him, the excitement of seeing you again might, might sort off set him back. Marilla, would you mind fixing me a pot of tea? Doctor Tatum...tell me. I want to know. He's serious, Anne. Isn't there anything we can do? Well...the folks are in a pretty bad way. - You mean financially? - Mm-hmm. It would mean bringing in another doctor. The best man in Canada. He's in Nova Scotia. That would cost an awful lot of money. Well...we have to get the money somehow. They've sold about everything they could. Why even the house is mortgaged. Yes, they've deprived themselves of everything just to keep me in school. What's the name of that doctor in Nova Scotia? (Doctor Tatum) 'Terry. Fredrick W. Terry.' 'Gilbert Blythe has been studying under him.' 'I wish they'd had such men when I went to school.' [knock on door] Come in. A young lady to see you, Mr. Gilbert. (Gilbert) 'Have her come in.' Anne. Hello, Gilbert. I hope you don't mind my coming to see you. I had to. You know, it's, it's wonderful to see you again, Anne. I've missed you terribly. We mustn't talk about that. I've promised Marilla that-- We've grown up since then, Anne. There's nothing we can do, Gilbert. And I owe them so much. Now, more than ever. Since Matthew's illness they're almost destitute. It'll be alright, Anne.. ...darling. Did you come to see me about Doctor Terry? Yes. How did you know? Doctor Tatum told me he was needed. Then? [instrumental music] That's Doctor Terry. I sent for him yesterday. Gilbert. - Hello, doctor. - Hi, Gilbert? Is he alright? May I see him now? I think he'll be alright. I wouldn't get him too excited, however. [music continues] Matthew. Very interesting case. Quite similar to one I had in Paraguay. Fine young man, that Gilbert Blythe. He might have been my boy, once. Marilla, where are you going? To get Gilbert Blythe and bring him right back here. [music continues]
