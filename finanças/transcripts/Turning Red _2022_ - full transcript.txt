The number one rule in my family? Honor your parents. They're the supreme beings who gave you life who sweated and sacrificed so much to put a roof over your head, food on your plate, an epic amount of food. The least you can do in return is every single thing they ask. 'Course some people are like, "Be careful. "Honoring your parents sounds great, "but if you take it too far, "well, you might forget to honor yourself." Luckily, I don't have that problem. I'm Meilin Lee. And ever since I turned 13, I've been doing my own thing. Making my own moves, 24/7, 365. I wear what I want, say what I want and I will not hesitate to do a spontaneous cartwheel if I feel so moved. Oh, crap! Not to brag, but being 13 means I'm officially a grown-up. At least according to the Toronto Transit Commission. Good for you. Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm. All about that hustle, am I right? Besties, assemble! - Miriam! - Hmm? Hey! Priya! Yo. Abby! Yeah. What's up, Mei? Ready to change the world? So ready. I was born to do this. Let's burn this place to the ground! Y equals negative four. Manitoba, Alberta, and Saskatchewan. I know, it's a lot... But this is grade eight. I don't got time to mess around. I guess you could call me... A very enterprising, mildly annoying young lady. A major weirdo. An overachieving dork-narc. I accept and embrace all labels. - Oops. - Hey! - Aah! - Oh, you're dead! Coming through! Move, please! Share the sidewalk, people! Anyway, who cares what stupid, evil Tyler or anyone else thinks? This is gonna be my year. Mei, Mei, Mei, come see this! And nothing's gonna stop this train from... Shh. Come on, come on! - Get your butt over here! - Go, go, go. Come on, come on. Mei, Mei, fast! - Shut up! - Shh! - Huh? - Mmm-hmm! - Uh... - Mmm. Devon. My mom cuts his hair at the salon, and I felt it. It's very soft. Whoa. Can I have some? Yeah, Abby, hook a sister up. Ugh! He looks like a hobo. A hot hobo. May I remind you what real men look like? 4-Town! Yes! 4-Town! Jesse went to art school. Tae Young fosters injured doves. Robaire speaks French. Hey! And Aaron T. and Aaron Z. are, like, really talented, too. - We are 4-Townies, remember? - Ride or die! Yeah, but tickets to 4-Town are, like, a bajillion dollars, and Devon's right here. And free! Ah, fudgesicles! I gotta go. Wait! We're going karaokeing today. - Yeah! - Come with us. Please. - Please. - I... can't. It's cleaning day. Mei, every day is cleaning day. Can't you just get one afternoon off? But I like cleaning. Plus, I got this new feather duster and, oh, my gosh, you guys, it picks up so much dirt, it's bananas! Fine. I'll let you go. If you can pass the gauntlet. - Come on. Uh! Oh. - Mir, not now... You can't resist it. Come on. You know you want to. Here we go. You're never not on my mind - Oh, my, oh, my - Oh, yeah, oh, my I'm never not by your side, your side Yeah. Your side - Peace sign. - All right! Yeah! Go, Mei! - See, that was good! - That was dope! You passed. And here is your reward. Ninety-nine Australian tour, with the Girl I Love Your Jeans remix. O-M-G, Mir! I'll guard it with my life! Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you! 4-Town 4-ever! 4-ever! We'll karaoke another time, I promise! Okay, sure, Mei! It'll be on me. The snacks, the tunes... - Whoo! - You're my jam, girl. She's so brainwashed. Crud, crud, crud. Okay. Excuse me. I know what it looks like. I am my own person. But that doesn't mean doing whatever I want. - Hello, Meilin. - Hey, how's it going? Thank you, Meilin! Like most adults, I have responsibilities. Hey, Bart. Hey, Lisa. - Hello, Meilin. - 'Sup? Still down for a rematch, Mr. Gao? Bring it, Lee! What a good girl. It's not all about me, you know? I do make my own moves, it's just that... ...some of my moves are also hers. Mei-Mei, there you are. - Hey, Mom... - You're ten minutes late. What happened? Are you hurt? Are you hungry? Um... How was school today? Killed it per usual. Check it out. Oh. That's my little scholar. Today, honor student, tomorrow, UN Secretary General. The ancestors would be so proud. Sun Yee, revered ancestor, guardian of the red pandas. We humbly thank you for protecting and guiding us. Especially Mei-Mei. May we continue to serve and honor you and this community. Always. - You ready? - Let's do this. Have fun getting that off. Shoo-shoo! You vandals! Oh, snap! They're coming! - You good-for-nothing hosers! - Go, go, go! I'm telling your mothers! Our family runs one of the oldest temples in Toronto. And the most unique. Instead of honoring a god, we honor our ancestors. And not just the dudes either. Our most revered ancestor, Sun Yee, was a scholar, poet, and defender of animals. She dedicated her life to the creatures of the forest. Especially the red panda. - Ta-da! - Ooh! Which she loved for its fiery coat and mischievous nature. Ever since, the red panda has blessed our family with good fortune and prosperity... And it can bless yours, too! - Bye-bye! - See you next time! Thanks for coming. - Give me five. - Yeah. - Come on. Dad's making dinner. - Ooh. Mmm. Huh? Uh... He should have listened to his mother and married Ling-Yi. Totally. Siu-Jyu is so two-faced. She's just using him to get to the throne. She'll probably stab him on their wedding night. Mmm-hmm. Hmm? Mmm. Hmm! - Perfect. - Yes! You've heard their hits, you've seen their moves. And now, you get to experience them live! The worldwide pop sensation 4-Town will be kicking off their North American tour! Tickets on sale now. Oh, my gosh! Who are these hip-hoppers? And why are they called "4-Town" if there are five of them? Uh... I don't know. Some of the kids at school like them. You mean Miriam? That girl is odd. Dinner's ready. I've never met nobody like you You're never not on my mind Oh my, oh my I'm never not by your side Your side, your side I'm never gonna let you cry Oh, cry, don't cry I'm gonna be your ride or die All right Hmm. Kinda looks like Devon. I don't get what Mir sees in him. He's not that cute. Okay, his shoulder's, like, kind of nice, I guess. His eyes are... fine. Mei-Mei. Ow! Ah! Do you want a snack? Cool, great, thanks. Don't look at the notebook, don't look at the notebook, don't! No! Oh. - Is this your homework? - Mom... - Don't! - Oh, my. What... What is... - Do not. - Huh? What? - Mom. - Oh! Oh. Huh? Huh? Mei-Mei, what is this? It's nothing. Just a boy. He's no one. A boy? Who is he? Did he do these things to you? No! It's just made up, Mom! It's not real. That hat. Is that the sketchy clerk from the Daisy Mart? Mom, no! What are you doing? No, no, no! No, no, no! Oh, snap! Mom, no! - You! - Whoa! What have you done to my Mei-Mei? Uh... Who? Meilin Lee, right here. I should report you to the police. How old are you? Thirty? I'm seventeen. Oh, see, see? This is what happens when you don't wear sunblock and do drugs all day! She's just a sweet, innocent child. How dare you take advantage of her! Mom! No! What? What a weirdo. Look at her. The Daisy Mart has lost a loyal customer today. Thank goodness I was here. That degenerate won't come near you again. Now, is there anything else I should know about, Mei-Mei? Nope. All good. You sicko! What were you thinking? Why would you draw those things? Those horrible, awful, sexy things? It's fine. You'll move to another city, change your identity. Mommy, I'm so sorry. You are her pride and joy, so act like it! This will never happen again. No! No, no, no! Mei-Mei... are you up? Breakfast is ready! - Mmm. - Hey! No sugar. Coming! Mmm. Porridge. This isn't happening. This isn't happening. - Wake up, wake up, wake up! - Mei-Mei, is everything okay? Don't come in here! Mei-Mei, what's going on, honey? Are you sick? Is it a fever? A stomach ache? Chills? Constipation? No! Wait. Is it... that? Did the... Did the red peony bloom? No! Maybe? But it's too soon. Don't worry, Mei-Mei. I'll get everything you need. Mommy's here. Jin. Jin! It's happening! Come on! Please! - Mei-Mei, I'm coming. - Crud. - I'm coming. - No! It's going to be okay. No, it's not! Will you just get out? Excuse me? I didn't mean that. I'm a gross red monster! Stop it! Stop talking! Mei-Mei, I know this is upsetting, but we are going to get through this together. I have ibuprofen, vitamin B, a hot water bottle, and pads. Regular, overnight, scented, unscented, thin, ultrathin... - Uh-huh. All right. - ...ultrathin with wings... Awesome. Just leave them by the sink. Mei-Mei. Perhaps we should talk about why this is happening. No! I mean, nah, it's okay. You are a woman now. And your body - is starting to change. - Mmm-hmm. It's nothing to be embarrassed about. Mom, please! You are now a beautiful, strong flower. No, no, no. Who must protect your delicate petals and clean them regularly. - Ming? Ming! - My porridge. Jin. Jin! Jin, open a window! Somebody call emergency! I'll just go to sleep, and when I wake up... this will all be over. What the... Whoa. Yes! No! Oh. I'm calm. Zen. Yes. Okay. No biggie. You'll figure this out, Lee. Just be the calm, mature adult you totally are. You got this. I know it feels strange, Mei-Mei, but I promise, nobody will notice a thing. Thank you for your concern, Mother. But I'll be fine. Well, here's your lunch. I packed extra snacks. And herbal tea. For cramps. It helps relax your... I got it. Thank you. Bye. Let's go, Beavers! Let's go! Hey, Mei. Hey, girlfriends. What is up? Uh, what's with the tuque? Uh... Bad hair day. Did you, like, work out this morning? I got you, girl. - Mei, we gotta talk. - Okay. Tyler's been telling everyone - about the Daisy Mart. - What? He said your mom went nuts. And that you're kind of a perv. I am not a... Tyler is an insecure jerkwad. Words were exchanged. Slightly uncomfortable secrets were revealed. End of story... Uh, Mei? Why are you staring at Carter Murphy-Mayhew? I wasn't. No! Tyler keeps putting these up. Knock it off, butthead. Not funny, Tyler! Devon, my precious manly man. I banish you. - Literally go away! - Begone! I'm gonna kill him! What is wrong with you? Oh, yeah? Yeah? You wanna do this? Leave her alone! You want a piece of me, huh? Come here! Smell you later, dorks. Yeah, that's what I thought. Get out of here, dude. Gotta go. - Uh, see you at lunch. - Mei? What's with her? What's with your face? What is with you? You're being weird. I'm just really excited about math. All right, guys. The quadratic formula. Let the fun begin. Who can tell me how the formula begins? X equals... What a surprise, no one. Okay, listen up. X equals negative B, plus or minus, don't forget that plus or minus, or I promise you, you will live to regret it. No. No. No. - Hi. Uh, ma'am? - This isn't happening. - Hi! - My child goes to this school. Why don't you come to the front office? - I'm sure that someone can... - Keep your... Ow! I pay my taxes. Whoa, what is that? All right, all right, settle down, little goblins. - Stop it! - Whoa! Mei-Mei! - No. Please, no. - Mei-Mei, help! Mei-Mei, tell him it's me! Mei-Mei! I will report you for trespassing. Tell him it's Mommy! Mei-Mei! Tell him you forgot your pads! Mei-Mei. Come back! O-M-G! Hey, I gotta go! Open up! Mei-Mei! Stop! Jin. Jin, get home now. There's been an emergency. Is it the woman thing? No! Another one. It's so good. Run! It's a monster! Awooga! Huh? Uh-oh. Mei-Mei. Mei-Mei. Gotta get home! Gotta hide! Mei-Mei. Mei-Mei. Mei-Mei! Oh! Mei-Mei! Mei-Mei? Don't look at me! Stay back! Sweetie, it's okay. Mommy is here. What's happening to me? What is it? What... What... It's happened already? What did you say? Ming? It's time. As you know, our ancestor, Sun Yee, had a mystical connection with red pandas. In fact, she loved them so much that she asked the gods to turn her into one. It was wartime. The men were all gone. Sun Yee was desperate for a way to protect herself and her daughters. Then one night, during a red moon, the gods granted her wish. They gave her the ability to harness her emotions to transform into a powerful, mystical beast. She was able to fend off bandits, protect her village, and save her family from ruin. Sun Yee passed this gift to her daughters, for when they came of age. And they passed it to theirs. But over time, our family chose to come to a new world. And what was a blessing became... an inconvenience. Are you serious? - No! - Mei-Mei, no! - It's a curse! - She meant it as a blessing. You cursed us! It's all your fault! Mei-Mei, stop! Listen to me. Listen! There's a cure! Really? How do you know? Because it happened to me. Why didn't you warn me? I thought I had more time! You're just a child. I thought, if I watched you like a hawk, I'd see the signs and be able to prepare. But it's going to be fine. I overcame it and you will too. On the next red moon, you'll undergo a ritual that will seal your red panda spirit into one of these. And then you'll be cured for good. Just like me. But any strong emotion will release the panda. And the more you release it, the more difficult the ritual will be. There is a darkness to the panda, Mei-Mei. You only have one chance to banish it, and you cannot fail. Otherwise, you'll never be free. Let's see, the next red moon will be the 25th. That's a whole month away. We'll wait it out together. And I'll be with you every step of the way. Not bad. I saved Wilfred. Thanks, Dad. It's only temporary, Mei-Mei. This way, we won't worry about any more accidents. Hmm? Sleep tight. Red is a lucky color. This is awful. What are we gonna do? Don't worry. We'll get through this. No one can see her like this. I never wanted this for her. Did you see how she was in the temple? Her eyes... Please... just... go away. No! Why? Why? Mei, it's us. - Open up. - Crud, no. Guys, what are you doing? Go away! Are you okay? Tap if you can hear us. One for yes, two for no! We were so worried. We thought you died of embarrassment. You need more pads? I brought extra. Forget that. 4-Town's coming to Toronto! What? Hey! It's okay, everybody be quiet! Everybody, it's just me! Shut up! It's okay, it's me! It's Mei! Calm down, all right? I'm gonna let go and you're gonna be chill. Got that? Mmm-hmm. Chill. Mei? Are you a werewolf? No! What? - She is a red panda! - Sick. You're so fluffy! You're so fluffy! - I've always wanted a tail. - Priya, Abby, quit it. Mei, what the heck happened? It's just some, you know, inconvenient, uh, genetic thingy I got from my mom. I mean... It'll go away. Eventually. Maybe. Aw, Mei. I hate this! I'm slobby, I'm smelly. My mom won't even look at me, and now 4-Town? When are they coming? May 18th. They just announced it. The 18th? There's no way this will be gone by then. Just go. Go become women without me. Mei. It's gonna be okay. No, it's not. I'm a freak. Just... Just leave me alone. Mmm. Yeah. Mmm. Let's go. Mmm. Yeah. Mmm. - Let's go. - I've never met nobody like you Had friends and I've had buddies It's true But they don't turn my tummy The way you do I've never met nobody Like you You're never not on my mind? Oh, my, oh, my I'm never not by your side Your side, your side I'm never gonna let you cry Oh, cry, don't cry I'll never not be your ride or die All right! - Yeah! Whoo! - Go, Mei! - Thanks, guys. - You're the best. - Aw, we love you, Mei. - You're our girl. Yeah. No matter what. Panda or no panda. Whoa. - Mei! - You're you! And you look amazing! Red looks so good on you. Is it gone? For now. But if I get too excited, it'll come right back... Ow! Abby, what the heck? Huh? Something feels different. Abby, hit me. Ow. Oh, my gosh! I stayed calm. Something about you guys, like, neutralizes the panda. Aw! It's our love. We're like a warm and fuzzy blanket. Yeah. This means I can have my room back. I can have my life back! No. Even better. You can come with us to 4-Town! Yeah! This could be our only chance to see them together. We're all asking our parents tonight. We're making our stand. Yeah. You in or you out? But I can't ask my mom. I'm a furry ticking time bomb! Of awesomeness! And now you can control it! So just prove it to her, and she's gotta let you go! Mei-Mei? Crap! You guys better go. - But... - No "buts," Mir. My mom already doesn't like you. Wait, she doesn't? I'll call you, I promise. - We love you, Mei. - Hang in there, girl. Everything okay? I thought I heard... Mom, I think I've made a breakthrough. Ready. Deforestation. Sad orangutan. Mmm! Your second place spelling bee trophy. The important thing is you tried. You spelled your little butt off. First place in our hearts. What a shame. So cute! No. So fuzzy. Must resist. We love you, girl. We love you, girl. Panda or no panda. How adorable. Mei. How is this possible? What happened to your panda? It's easy. When I start to get emotional, all I do is imagine the people I love most in the whole world. Oh. - Which is you guys. - Oh. Oh, Mei-Mei. So, now that that's settled, I just have one teeny-tiny favor to ask. No. Absolutely not. What? But this is once in a lifetime. Mei-Mei, it's one thing to stay calm at home or school, but a concert? You'll get whipped up into a frenzy and panda all over the place. I won't, I won't! I promise! You saw me keep it in. Ming, maybe we should trust her. It's them I don't trust. Look at those glittery delinquents - with their... - gyrations. Why on earth do you want to go so badly? Chug! Chug! Chug! Like I said, I just want to broaden my musical horizons. This isn't music. This is filth. And it's not worth jeopardizing your life over. - Right, Jin? - Uh... See? Your father agrees. No concert. And that's final. Okay, well, thanks for listening. Good night. What was that? Am I the only one who sees the danger here? There's no way she could keep her panda in. And $200? For what? Who do they think they are? Celine Dion? Hmm. Unbelievable. I saw that look. Where did she get that from? Treating her own mother like that. Hold on. Ming, it's your mother. I'm not here! Mother. Hello. How's everything in Florida? Ming. I know about Mei-Mei. I was just about to call you, but everything's fine. I'm gonna handle the ritual on my own. The way you "handled" Mei-Mei being on the news? No one knows anything. They barely saw her. I'm on my way. With reinforcements. No! I can handle it. I can... Run! Eyes on the balls, guys! Be water! Be... That presentation was bomb-dot-com. I cited all my sources. I had sparklers. And she still said no! My parents said I could go when I'm 30. Mine called it stripper music. What's wrong with that? Mine said yes, but I have to buy the ticket. Who the heck's got that kind of cash? I know my mom's worried, but sometimes she's just so... - So... - Wacko? Ma'am! Please! I'm sorry, Mrs. Lee! I see you! Little momma's girl. No wonder Mei is such a loser. Illegal throw! You're out, Lee. What? But, Mr. K, he... Mei, chill. Let's go, let's go. Calm down, Mei. Dude, keep it together. I can't. We need to see this concert. Why doesn't my mom get that? I never ask for anything. My whole life I've been her perfect little Mei-Mei. Temple duties, grades... - Violin! - Tap dancing. Yeah. We've been so good. If they don't trust us anyway, then what's the point? Wow! Who are you? - I love it! - Fight the power! Yeah. Yeah. This isn't just our first concert. This is our first step into womanhood. And we have to do it together. I'm in, girl. We'll say it's a sleepover at my house. The perfect crime. Yes! My mom will never know. Now we just got to raise the money for tickets. Come on, girls, think! Know what'll help me think? - A little panda. - Abby... Come on, Mei. It'll clear my mind. Just a little hit! It's so cute! Ugh. Fine. Mon amour. Happy? Oh, yeah. That's the stuff. O-M-G. Aah! Go away! That was you in the bathroom! I didn't imagine it! - Yeah, you did. - Get lost, Stacy. But she's like a magical bear? Red panda! You are the cutest thing ever! Come out, please? Yeah, yeah, yeah! Please! Wait. So, you like the panda? Like it? I love it! I'll give you anything! Money? - My kidney! - My soul. - Yeah! - Adorable! You're so cute! Is it on? - Let's go! - Yeah, panda! - Fuel for domination. - Money, money, money! Stop hogging and give me some! Pass that over. 4-Town, here we come! Stop! That's so gross. Do it again. All right, troops, listen up. Operation 4-Town Shake Down is about to commence. The boys are coming to the SkyDome May 18th. Our goal, four tickets. That's 800 bucks! Step one, neutralize the empress. Mathletes? Isn't it a little dangerous to join an after-school club now? What's dangerous is an academic record with a lack of extracurriculars. Hmm... Huh. Step two... Spread the word. And step three... hustle this panda and squeeze every last loonie outta those kids. And, baby, I did it on my own Did it on my own Own Did it on my own, yeah You know what's up You know it's us, yeah You ready? Here we go - You want it? - I want it - You want it? - I want it - You want it? - I want it Louder - You want it? - I want it - You want it? - I want it - You want it? - I want it Give me one, two, three, four You wanted it, you went for it And, baby, you got it I wanted it, I went for it And, baby, I did it on my own Did it on my own Own Did it on my own - Let's go. - Yeah! Did it on my... - Oh, no, it's falling! - Grab it! Yeah, dude, let's go! Push it, dude! Come on! Come on, new guy, just keep on going! Come on, guys, keep going. Check out Number 12. He's got delts for days. Forget that. I need lunch. I'm starting to black out! I think I'm getting carpal tunnel. No pain, no gain, Priya. Come on, chop-chop! Five, 10... Girl, relax. Yeah. We're doing our best. It's not enough! The concert's this Saturday and we're still a hundred short! I knew we should have charged more for photos! Stupid, stupid, stupid! Mei, breathe. It's in the bag. But... What's the point of getting to the concert if you're too exhausted to enjoy it? Now, take a break and help me appreciate some boys. Okay, okay, okay. Hey, what's up? - Mei! - Hey, Mei, what up? - Looking good! - Nice calves! Are you a triangle? 'Cause you acute! You guys are so weird. - Hey! - Are you spying on us? I wanna talk to you, Lee. - Forget it. - Fine. Wonder if your mom knows her precious little Mei-Mei has been flaunting the panda all over school. That's none of your business! One more step and I'm telling her everything. Now, put that thing away and hear me out. What do you want? I wanna throw a sick birthday party. An epic one. It's this Friday. If you're there, everyone will come. Simple as that. A party? Look, I've done you a favor keeping my mouth shut. All I'm asking for is one back. Hmm. I'll do it. But it'll cost you one... No. Two hundred bucks. Okay. Uh, hold, please. Are you serious? You can't trust him. It's a trap! This sounds like a boy-girl party. Are we allowed to boy-girl parties? Guys! Two hundred bucks will put us over the top! We have to do this. We'll meet at Tyler's, I'll do my thing, and then we'll bounce. Easy-peasy. Dude, what about your mom? Forget my mom. I'll be back before she even knows I'm gone. - But... - Hey, dorkbag. We're in. But you only get the panda for an hour. And we are not bringing any presents. Deal. Okay, I'm heading off to mathletes. See you later! Wait, what about dinner? I made all your favorites. Thanks, but Miriam's dad is, uh, ordering pizza. Save me leftovers? - What if I come with you? - Wha... What are you doing? Linear equations? Geometry? I have a double-jointed elbow! Look! I can make a perfect circle! Wow! Yeah, but it'll be super boring. Wouldn't you rather hang with Dad? Oh. Let's get my flashcards. - But... - Hmm. I was mathletes champ - in grade 8, you know? - Uh-huh. They called me the "Uncommon Denominator." Cool. Oh, uh, Jade Palace is on tonight. - Can't miss that, right? - Now, who's the weak link? Priya and Abby seem bright enough, but... Oh, and traffic's a nightmare. I can just take the streetcar... - you stay and rest. - Miriam... I mean, she's a nice girl, but maybe she's slowing you down. Oh, Mom, you really don't have to come. Don't be silly. We're already on the way. But I don't want you to! Chop-chop, everyone. Don't dawdle. Hurry up. Oh! What... Hey, cuz! Surprise! Aunties? What are you doing here? The ritual, silly. - She's lost weight. - No, no, she gained weight. - She looks like her mother. - She looks like her father. Ladies. Mother. Hey, Grandma. Poor dear. It must be so difficult keeping that unruly beast at bay. Your family is here now, Mei-Mei. And we will take care of everything. Everybody clap your hands Clap, clap, clap, clap your hands All right, now, we gonna do the basic step... Where is she? Who's up for some Boggle? Eat. You need your strength for the ritual. Thank you, aunties. Your hair is so thick, like a pelt. What a surprise that you all came so early. You need all the help you can get, Ming. So, Mei-Mei, you've been managing to keep the panda in? - Yep. Totally. - Really? What's that, Lily? Well, it's a little hard to believe that Mei-Mei could control such a beast. She's just a child. It's true. And if Mei-Mei's panda is anything like Ming's... Mei-Mei's better than any of us at controlling the panda. She passed every trigger test. Even the kitten box. - Oh! - Oh, my goodness! - That's unbelievable. - Impressive. She just thinks of my love for her, and it gives her the strength to stay calm. Exactly. - Aw. - How sweet. How sweet. Anyway, thanks for all the gifts, but I think I'll go to bed early. Keeping that animal locked down sure takes a lot of energy. Okay, sweetie. Get some rest. Night, everyone. - Good night, Mei-Mei. - Sleep well. - Get some beauty rest. - Get some rest. Oh! Mei-Mei, can I have a word with you? Uh, sure. What's up? I found this. Strange for a girl who hasn't let her panda out. It's, uh... It's not mine. Mei-Mei, I know what you're doing. I know how hard it is to keep the beast in. It feels so good to let it out. So free. But each time you do, the stronger it gets. And then you'll be bound to it forever, and the ritual will fail. Has that ever happened? It cannot happen. Your mother and I were close once, but the red panda took that away. I couldn't bear to see that happen to you. So, no more panda. You are your mother's whole world, Mei-Mei. I know you'll do what's right. Uh-uh. Mmm. Mmm! - Uh, worm. - Uh... Octopus! - Spaghetti? - Killer robot! Mortality. Hmm. Nice. This sucks. - Let's bail. - Just wait. She'll be here. I knew she'd flake. Panda girl! - It's Mei! - Thank Cthulhu. Ugh. About time. Yo! What up, peeps? What are you wearing? Hey, Tyler. Happy birthday. I'm paying for the red panda, not this garbage! Deal's off! Wait! Can garbage do this? Uh-huh. Or this? Stir the porridge. Come on, guys! Stir the porridge. Are you feeling okay? Guys, it's hard to explain, but just, hmm... Just trust me on this. I can't panda anymore. I'm sorry. Okay, okay, okay. It's fine. You don't have to do it. We'll just, uh, figure something... I won't go. What? Priya, you can't not go. Jesse's your soul mate. But we only have enough - for three tickets. - Then I'll stay home. Abby, no! I'll stay home. Guys, if we can't all go, then none of us should go. Right? Just one last time. Hey, Tyler! You want the panda? You're getting the panda. Let's hear it for the birthday boy! Yes! Go, Tyler! Go, Tyler! - Go, go, go, Tyler! - Yeah! Okay! Yeah! Get it, girl! Yeah! Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! Faster! Faster! Whoo! - Yeah! - Yeah! Yeah! You sure the hotel's all right? It'll do. At least breakfast is free. Get some rest. You look tired. Good night, cuz. Try that tea. - Good night, Ming. - Good night. Ming, this is a critical time. Mei-Mei needs a strong hand, now more than ever. Don't let her out of your sight. I won't, Mother. Hmm. Oh. Oh. Oh, no. "Fur baby"? Oh! What? What... Mei-Mei. What is all... Yeah! We did it! We are seeing 4-Town! - Whoo! - Yes. Hey, has anyone seen Mei? Dang. He is working you. What a diva! It'll all be worth it. Tomorrow, we are walking into that concert girls and coming out women. Literally goosebumps. Hmm. What do you think Jesse smells like? Milk chocolate and wet rocks. Wow! So manly. Oh, yes! It's happening, Robaire Junior! You're finally gonna meet your daddy! And your hot uncles! What? It's true. Mei, what if you didn't do the ritual? What if you kept the panda? - What? - Look at you! You're not the same feather-dustin', straight-A, goody-goody... Who we never saw, like, ever. - Yeah. - You're such a rebel now. Guys, I can't be like this forever. My whole family would freak. Especially my mom. All her hopes and dreams are pinned on me. I know. But you've really changed and I'm proud of you. Just don't get rid of all of it, you know? Yeah. If it weren't for you, none of this would be happening. - You the bomb! - Word. You da bomb, Mei. No, you da bomb. We all da bomb! Yes. Yes. Yes! We da bomb! 4-Town, here we come! - - Robaire, I love you! We're coming for you! We are women! - We are women! - We are hot! All right, homies, next up is 4-Town. The boys are coming to Toronto on the 25th! So get your tickets now. And check it, they'll be cranking open the SkyDome and performing under a red lunar eclipse. It's gonna be galactic, for sure. Abby... you said the concert was the 18th. It is! He's wrong! Look! The 18th, Toronto! Uh... This says Toledo. What? Toledo? What the heck is Toledo? - Oh, no. - What? 4-Town's the same night as the ritual? No! The same night? The same night? What? - Mei, chill. - It's okay. No, it isn't! I can't miss 4-Town! We worked so hard! But the ritual. I'll let everyone down! - No, no, no! - Hey, Panda Girl. What are you doing? We want more rides. Buzz off, jerkface. I'm busy. Oh, snap! You gonna take that, Tyler? You want your money? Then get your butt down here now! Forget your money, and forget you! Mei! Let's just go. What about our deal? Shove your deal! Fine! Get out of here! Go back to your psycho mom and your creepy temple, you freak! Mei, no! Take it back! Don't talk about my family like that! - You're hurting him! - Mei! - Mei-Mei, stop! - I hate you! I hate... What is going on here? I'm sorry. Just get off of me. Please. I cannot believe you would let your daughter do this! Do you understand what she did to my boy? I am so sorry. She's never done anything like this before. I don't know what came over her. I don't want to hear your apologies, okay? - I'm sorry again. - She is an animal! All right, party's over! Everyone, go home! I can't believe you girls would use her like this! - What? - But we didn't. No, we'd never. - What? - I knew you were trouble. Putting all these thoughts into Mei-Mei's head, parading her around. Now she's lying, sneaking out. She attacked a defenseless boy. You think this is a joke? Do you know how dangerous this is? We didn't mean to, we just wanted to see 4-Town. 4-Town! You manipulated her for a bunch of tacky delinquents? - No! She wanted to... - Don't you blame her. She is a good girl, and you've taken advantage of her. Mei, tell her. - What? - Dude! Come on, Mei-Mei. Let's go. Will call that way. All righty, general admission, eh? How many tickets? Three, please. What is that? Um, I think it's coming from the SkyDome, Mother. Four is the worst number. You know, Vivian was due on the fourth, but I held her in until the fifth... Quiet, Lily. Hurry up, everyone. It's almost time to start the ritual. Nervous, Mei-Mei? - A little. - Oh, well, I've got 50 years' experience as a shaman. This will be a piece of cake. And mostly painless. Thanks, Mr. Gao. Wait, "mostly"? Long ago, the spirits blessed the women of our family with a great challenge. Mei-Mei, tonight is your turn. Like all the women around this table, you too will banish the beast within and finally become your true self. May Sun Yee guide you and keep you safe. - Hear, hear! - That's right. Don't blow it. Uh... It's almost time. The red moon is about to begin. Mei-Mei, go get ready. Yes, Mother. Oh, where are the instruments? It's so amazing! - Hmm. Huh? - Jin! - Help clear the table! - Uh-huh. Uh... Oh! Is it on? 4-Town, here we come! Huh. That's so gross. Hmm. Did it on my own I hate you! Come in. Hey, Dad. I... I'm almost ready. Did you make this? Here, I'll erase it. What? We were just being stupid. The panda's dangerous, outta control. Huh. You sound like your mother. What has she told you about her panda? Nothing. She won't talk about it. It was quite destructive. And big. She almost took out half the temple. You... You saw it? Only once. She and your grandma had a terrible fight. Over what? Your grandma didn't approve of me. But you should've seen your mom. She was incredible. But I'm a monster. People have all kinds of sides to them, Mei. And some sides are messy. The point isn't to push the bad stuff away, it's to make room for it, live with it. Mei, erase it if you want, but this side of you... made me laugh. Dude, you're crazy! Come here! Mei-Mei. It's time. Just follow my directions and breathe. Now don't move from the circle. You understand? For as long as the red moon shines, the astral realm will be open. And this circle is the door. What are they saying? The door will open only if we sing from our hearts. It doesn't matter what. I like Tony Bennett, but your grandma, uh, she's from old school. Now, focus on their voices. Let them guide you. Oh, Sun Yee, revered ancestor, hear us now. Guide this girl through her inner storm. Louder! Louder! And return the red panda spirit from where it came! Sun Yee. You can do it. Keep going! No! What happened? - What was that? - Mei-Mei... Is everyone okay? Oh, my goodness, I can't... Mei-Mei. It's okay. We can do it again. Mei-Mei? I'm keeping it. - What did she say? - Keeping it? I'm keeping it! - Oh, no! - Mei-Mei! Stop her! - What are you doing? - Stop, Mei-Mei! - Don't let her go! - No! - Let go! - What has come over you? Stop! Get a hold of her! - Mei-Mei! Stop! - Don't do this! Mei-Mei! No! I'm going to the concert! - Get back here! - Mei-Mei! Stop! - A concert? - No! This is a disaster. Unbelievable. Ming! Too good to be true. How could you let this happen? She's out of control! Ming, it's okay. Ming! Ming! Answer me! What are we going to do about this? How could she? How could she do this to... her own mother? Ming? Mei-Mei! Excuse me! Whoo! Yeah! 4-Town! - Mei! - Mei! - You're here! - What are you doing here? I couldn't do it. The panda's a part of me, and you guys are too. Mei, you threw us under the bus. I know and I'm sorry. I've been, like, obsessed with my mom's approval my whole life. I couldn't take losing it, but losing you guys feels even worse. Well, too bad. 'Cause you did. Robaire Junior? She's been taking care of him 24/7. No. And singing him lullabies every night! No, no, no, I haven't. They're lying. Here. Found him at Tyler's. 4-Town forever? 4-Town forever. - 4-Town forever. - 4-Town forever! Tyler? No! Tyler? Who's Tyler? I don't know a... You are a 4-Townie? No! Stop! - No way! - Yeah! Welcome to the sisterhood! Whatever, dorks. Cut it out! Your mom must have gone nuclear. Who cares? What's she gonna do? Ground me? 4-Town! 4-Town! 4-Town! 4-Town! 4-Town! Let's go! Is it starting? It's starting! Guys, hold me. Four, three, two, one! Are you ready? Oh, my gosh! Yeah! Z! I love you, man! Yeah! Yeah! Yes! Jesse! Toronto! Who knows what's up? Yes! You want it? I want it - You want it? - I want it - You want it? - I want it Give me one, two, three, four You wanted it You went for it And, baby, you got it I wanted it I went for it And, baby, I did it on my own Did it on my own Own Did it on my own Mei-Mei! No way! Is this part of the show? Is this special effects? Help! Help! Mei-Mei! Where are you? Mom? Mei-Mei! - I want a refund. - What's her problem? Mei! It was just getting good! This isn't cool. - Mei! Mei! - Dad? We have to save your mother! She's gone loco! Mei, we have to do the ritual again. What happened? She's huge! I told you she was big! That big? Mei-Mei! Ming! She's your daughter! Mei! - Let her go! - Don't hurt her! You are in big trouble, young lady! Mom! Let go! I'm shutting this down, right now! Everyone, go home! Where are your parents? Put some clothes on! This isn't you! This is me! - Mei-Mei! - Mei! Are you hurt? I'm not your little Mei-Mei anymore! I lied, Mom! What? It was my idea to hustle the panda. My idea to go to Tyler's party! It was all me! I like boys! I like loud music! I like gyrating! I'm 13! Deal with it! The ritual. Everyone in position. Mei-Mei, keep her busy. Oh, I'll keep her busy. Where's Jin? Jin! Mei! Keep her in the circle! Get back here! Make me! You think you're so mature! Lying to me! Blaming me! How could you be so, so... crass? Oh! That's nothing! You wanna see crass? - What are you doing? - You like that? Yes! - Stop moving like that! - What's wrong? - Is this bothering you? - Stop it! Yeah, Mei! Destroy her with your big butt! Yeah! Go, go, go! Start singing now! Ladies! Stop! Sing louder! We're trying. - Stop it! - Let's get out of here! Come on! - Huh? Take it, Mom! Take it! - No! Stop it! Stop! All I wanted... ...was to go to a concert! I never went to concerts! I put my family first! I tried to be a good daughter! Well, sorry I'm not perfect! Sorry I'm not good enough! And sorry I'll never be like you! Oh, no! Mom... Mom! No! Mom! You have to get in the circle! Wake up! I'm sorry! Mom? Come on. Please! Sun Yee, give me strength. - Pull, Mei-Mei! - Grandma? I am not losing my daughter. Don't just stand there! Make room for your elders, Mei-Mei! - What? - We're with you! But what are you doing? What if you can't turn back? - Your mom needs us! - She's family! Less talking, more pulling! - This fur is so itchy! - Quiet, Lily! Louder! Sing from the heart! Louder! The circle isn't working! - Never met nobody - Nobody Never met, never met, never met Like You Get up I never met nobody Like you Had friends and I've had buddies It's true But they don't turn my tummy The way you do I've never met nobody like you You're never not on my mind Oh, my, oh, my I'm never not by your side Your side, your side I'm never gonna let you cry Oh, cry, don't cry I'll never not be your ride or die All right! Huh? Mom? Mom! Mom? Are you okay? We have to... Mom? I'm sorry. It's all my fault. What happened? I... I hurt her. Who? My mom! I got so angry, and I lost control. I'm just so sick of being perfect! I'm never gonna be good enough for her. Or anyone. I know it feels that way. Like, all the time. But... it isn't true. Come on. Really? I could explode at any moment. - We have to find them. - Where are they? - Finally. - Hurry, hurry! Where have you been? Come on! - Let's get the lead out! - Ladies. - I'm sorry. - Shh! You don't have to apologize. I'm your mother. May Sun Yee guide you and keep you safe. One at a time, ladies. And quickly. That's it? Mei-Mei's keeping the panda? It's her life. Now move. Go ahead. It's okay. No. Mei-Mei, please. Just come with me. I'm changing, Mom. I'm finally figuring out who I am. But... I'm scared it'll take me away from you. Me too. I see you, Mei-Mei. You try to make everyone happy, but are so hard on yourself. And if I taught you that... I'm sorry. So, don't hold back. For anyone. The farther you go, the prouder I'll be. I'm not going to regret this, am I? I'm Meilin Lee, and ever since I turned 13, life's been a lot. People still talk about Pandapocalypse 2002. Mom and I just call it... growing pains. This thing's hungry all the time. Eat up, little one. Oh, you're so hungry. - Munch, munch, munch. - What? Mr. Gao had to put her panda in something. You should see Grandma's. Hmph! So unlucky. You ready? Let's do this. - Hello! Welcome to our temple! - What up, Toronto! - Get in here! - Yes, come on in. And things at the temple have never been better. O-M-G! That looks so cute!

Ready to get your karaoke on? Totally. Bye, Mom! Bye, Dad! Hold on. You're not going out like that, are you? My panda, my choice, Mom. I'll be back before dinner, okay? Fine. Oh, um... You're welcome to join us. For Mr. Lee's cooking? - Uh, yeah! - We're so there. Don't load up on junk. Thanks for covering for me, Dad. Have fun! And I'll beatbox. And I can bleach my hair, too. And, yeah... sometimes I miss how things were, but nothing stays the same forever. O-M-G! I'm so excited for the new album. We've all got an inner beast. We've all got a messy, loud, weird part of ourselves hidden away. And a lot of us never let it out. But I did. How about you?
