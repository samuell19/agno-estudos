In January 1989 went as a group of students from the Soviet Estonia to Siberia, to the Buriat mountains, to find adventure and nephritis. Strangely, the event is not haunted me in my dreams. In 25 years, I may have seen a panorama of mountains once. I was with strange people. Large areas and emptiness. White snow. Nothing. The group had not met very many times. This particular group had never walked together. It was a difficult task. Really difficult. GHOST MOUNTAINEER Based on true events And now... Smile! Let's go! It was wonderful at first. A little snow and easy to attack. The weather was amazingly warm. The group consisted of geology students. There was Olle, geologist and team leader. His classmate Anne, and so Margus, which we called "Muscle Man". In some way the leader had managed to attract the a blond first-year medical student, Inge. There was a bit of romance in the air... Put your feet properly, so it is easier to walk. I, Eero, and my friend Indrek, studying not geology. We studied biology, and it's something completely different. But we heard that they needed people in the group, so we hung out with. An important part of a hiking trip is the train ride there. It is five days together in a small cabin. A week earlier Do not touch the salt with your fingers or eggs! Trans-Siberian express train Moscow-Irkutsk We go through this. Cross is a mountain pass. This is where we can go over the ridge into the next valley. Here is a canyon and there is nephritis. Very beautiful. If I think about the non-existent map, we went there with... It was a black and white map with some ditritade mountain. It was a voyage basis. Geologists! Why are you in dry dock? Is that Brezhnev's funeral? Doctor! What was your name again? I do not remember! I'm crappy at remembering girl name. Inge. You know that. Damn, that name does not fit you. You should be called something else. Marleen... Dr. Marlene Dietrich. What hair! Did you bring this woman on a hiking trip? Ignore him. Full biologists. What? The map is also thirsty. -Olle, what if I interactivity Fix It? -You do. I will help you. There are two awesome weeks. You will see. Walking day number six Tunkbergen, eastern Siberia, Buryatia. 6300 km from Estonia. Inge... What happened? Why you looking for? -I can not take anymore. We took the wrong road. Take off your backpack. Take on this. We have to get to the woods before dark. It's warmer there. I can not continue. Eero! Why did you bring us? Shall we continue? We have to share a few things from Inge's backpack. Fuck him. Anne, put this in your bag. Why do you stand there, come here! Where is Margus? Hell! Before, it was snowing out there, now it's snowing inside too. I do not understand why we have not found the first mountain pass in six days. Marleen, your guy can not seem to read the map. I feel you. Your first trip and this chaos. It's usually not like this. -Laviner. -Far away. Here is some snow. We can go through there. There we have our passports. -Are you sure? -Obvious. We will go through tomorrow. If we go wrong once we give up. I do not go home without nephritis. You have been invited by strange people. No one else wanted to come along. Olle, the map may be wrong. It's not your fault. Look! Look! It touched the foot. Come on, give here. Geologists were very serious. I do not remember someone said that I was good. I received no praise at all. What is the fucking mountain pass out? We need to continue. It's up here. Come on! We made it! We are kings! Marleen, what are you waiting for? Look how beautiful it is! The last member is here! Now I really regret that Olle found the first mountain pass. What are they here for? Shamanism. To contact the spirits and other worlds. If you sacrifice something of a sacred place Get a bright future and evil can not take one. Think someone on that shit? - If you do that, Anne? Well then... Then we stay overnight in a holy place. Klutz! It is enough. Add a little more. There is a very nice place near. Should we watch it together? It is not far away. -inge... What? Neck or you? I thought we could go there. I can not go anywhere anymore. It's just too hard. Shit you there? Maybe it hurts a little. -Who wants tea? -I. Damn, that's never happened before. The foot will rest for the night. Maybe we should skip the canyon? We are behind the plan anyway. Then we would come home on time. Do not start. We came here nephritis, not to sing. I came here to sing. -What is it? The wind. -heard you? -Skorstenen... It was so quiet, and so was the wind. No, it is not the wind. Did you hear? I know what it is. I know why it hangs bands out there. Here, in these mountains... A mountaineer disappeared long ago. No one noticed that he had disappeared. And now he walks around. Around here. He's looking for walkers to take revenge on. He was black with rage. When you meet him, it happens something. He looks at you... Here. And that's the end. That's all. For he is no longer something face. You can not tell such stories. Everything can be told. -Not in the mountains! He always says that. It's just a fairy tale. Look at him. A sleeping genius. Quiet, now will it. The haunting climber. Walking day number eleven. Where's the alcohol? What? In your bag. Bowl! For a successful day. Marleen fell type 70 times, but it is not. I thought I would die today. -Olle, come here. Where the hell is the fire? It is here. Let it go. We take a glass first. I drink when we arranged it here. -Damn. None has been preparing the wood for the stove! What are you waiting for? It will be dark soon. Hell! Do not thrust upon her. Is that understood? It was sometime mid-journey we noticed that Olle was almost completely silent. He barely spoke to us. We went to nefritkanjonen. Nephritis is easy to form, but to break the... My tip hack broke but I got off a single bit. Stop. I told you it was useless to go here. A mountain full of nephritis, but we must not loose anything. Hell! Everything breaks down! Spetshackan, the fucking legs! Like a fucking curse! Margus, it's a curse. Come here and feel! The water is warm. -Cool! How is that possible? It comes from within the mountain. We swimming. The water is warm. -Listen, you, come here. Olle! Damn, Olle, it is nephritis. It is. That is extra cool. You gonna take all the stones to you? -It's done. What should you do with them? You can not wear them. You limping. -And? I thought nephritis would be more beautiful. A gemstone that glitters is not... It is not precious stones, but semi-precious... Honestly, this is the usual meaningless green stones. I can take that kind of grandmother's potato country. It can not. It is said that they can change a person's life... You are not interested in anything. I do not know what you are doing on our faculty. I am a geneticist Anne. Not someone who smells of flowers or investigating älgskit. Or someone who picks stones. This senseless stone is enough for me. Father and air... Meaningless little stone. What is it with him again? -Leave him alone. Walking day number 16th We have to go back a bit, around the hillside. We can not go straight down here. It is 5 km. The ice is weak down there. We are not equipped for this. What kind of equipment we need? What's down there? -A small waterfall. Isbroddarna hold. Ints, take the rope and we'll try. Just two cigarette left. Soon we smoke moss. We try to camp earlier in the day. We go back. I have responsibility for all of you. Responsibility for what? If you start looking for the last session in the same way we will eat moss, too, not just smoke it. Let Eero try. Here... If we lose this, we can continue. We can at least try. Take the map and guide us. What's with you? I know it is the first group you lead, but you do not play sur officers all the time. Even Anne looks like a beaten dog. Apologize! -Be apologize for calling someone a dog. -Have you lost your mind? Apologize! Can you hear me? Apologize now! -Calm down. -Do you hear? Apologize! -Go! -Apologize! You broke down the whole trip! Yes you! -Oh my God! Eero! Fucking shit! Everything's cool. I landed fine. Throw down backpacks and follow me. The ice is nice and hard and Olle can go to hell. I do not care what he says. What is wrong? Oh my God! How long have you had it? It is inflamed. Why did not you say something? Olle! Please, let's go with the others? Olle... Skiing on the way! I will show. -I am coming too. -Wait for me! It is scary! In the haunting mountain climber's tracks! Are you still there? Yes, stay where you are! Olle! They will be nowhere else than here. What if something animal attack them? It's too early to worry about. I'm afraid! Olle! -It's not funny! You're a scaredy-cat... And? How long have you and Olle had something? What was that? Ice cracking. How long? -There's nothing between us. -Sure. I was just so sick of all the studying. -What is it? -Elden disappears. Add more wood then! - ints! Anything there? I'm afraid to be there alone. -They are coming! He's plastered. Where's Anne? -Over there. She follows the tracks. Good thinking! No, but hey! A little love, right? -Margus! You stink! Why shouting you do not return? We were jätteoroliga. Can you hear me? Anne! He has toothache. Severe inflammation. Did you know that? Did you notice that? You'd be medic. Last trekking day. A beautiful sunny day. The valley we came in was incredibly beautiful and white. People were tiny dots. Then came a pass that was not so hard. Nothing special, rather flat, we could just go on. The snow remained, it was above the tree line. The snow was hard. My favorite workout! Because it's the last one! The last mountain pass! -Has it flicked off? -Just. What? -It's broken. -AT hell with it! -There are no images. Damn! The time is also broken. But I do not care. If we move as quickly as possible, we can be in the village at night. Ints, we go see where we can go down somewhere. -Candy? -No. -Ints, you want candy? -Stop it up the ass. Candy? Is it better? It does not hurt anymore? You could tell it. We're smoked. It's too far down that road. And it is too steep here. -Not for long, but still. I'll see where we go. I know that the map is good. How did we get lost in it? Everything is there. Moose, älgskit, Anne herpes and everything. Holy shit, too. The world belongs to the brave. Those who are afraid will go around. See you down there. Oh my God! -What happened? -The fucking snow hit me from behind. Where is Olle? He was in front of me. -Olle! -Snön came from behind. -What happened? -Begravdes he in the snow? -He... -What did you see? -He was... I think he was there. -Here? -Here? -I do not know. Somewhere... Do you hear? There is a ski! He is under the snow! Come here! Quiet. Gently... -Come here! -Olle is under the snow! Come here! -A avalanche or something. -So small? Help me to shovel! Hell! The bucket! There are rocks here! Quiet, maybe we can hear him! There was no real avalanche, more like an avalanche and there must have been a ravine underneath. The strangest thing was that the snow that had just been so smooth quickly froze. We did not know how much snow was there. But there was no skiing right there. Where this he was? -I do not know! We try here. Help! Olle! There is so little snow down here, I do not see if there are any traces. He did not go there alone. It would not be the first time. Are you stupid? With the tent? He would have come back to check on us. I do not think he's here. We would have found him for the long time then. -You saw him here, Eero. -I do not know what I saw. -I got a blackout. -For, my camera is gone. You can survive during the snow for a long time. We can not go from here. Did you see if the zipper was closed when we came down? -I do not know. -Damn. If the camera is gone, I'm smoked. Farsan will kill me. I want something to eat. Anne... We can not stay here. Without a tent we will freeze to death. -The clock is at least four or five. -No! Well, that's it. We have 30 km left to go. The snow is so deep. We'll get help. Maybe he went to the village? To go to a dentist? I know that I very much wanted to go home. Well, not home, but away from the mountains. We went almost through the night. We fled. We fled from what is expected. Burjatisk village. 310 km from Irkutsk, the nearest town. -Are you from Irkutsk? -Yes. Why you dance like a fool? Has anyone come? militia Department Your idiots. -Located Estonia here? No, there. I know! We delivered you from the fascists. Sit down. -Pratar you German in Estonia? No, Estonian. So weird. German letters in a Soviet passport. What were you doing up in the mountains? We... we walked. We came here to watch. We sought adventure. You can not go up in the mountains, just like that. Somebody may have seen him here? Perhaps you have a helicopter, so that you can look after him. Do you think this is Switzerland? How the hell either. It is Siberia. This is Buryatia. You were looking for adventure... You lost a man, not me! Pension Green cedar Throw away the stones, no one will see it. -Why? -Just do it! -Why? They can give us problems. -Vadå problem? -Do not you understand? Get permission to pick nephritis? No, you do not know... Did you look up the places we went to? -In the border regions should be authorized. We lied. If anyone asks is the state of Olle's backpack. -Or tell me you do not speak Russian. -Neither do I. -Olle then? Nobody knows anything. The village is full of people from outside. Miners in the winter or something. He could have jumped on a bus or riding a car from here. Without saying anything. They want us to go back into the mountains. To investigate the avalanche. No one else here can do it. The militia should look for people who have disappeared. Who the hell wants to go back there? They have taken our passports. We can not withdraw without them. Hello? Can you hear me? Do you know how to use a phone? -No connection. Oh my God! Thank God for that I will soon go away. A village! Eero! Wait! A man from the village was talking to me and said that there is a hut in the mountain pass. Olle be there. No one here. What is it? Margus, what is it? Something kind of insect! The bits. Can I see. Bit it? -I do not see anything. -Relax. Sleeping. Margus, it was just a dream. Eero... I must tell you something. When it had happened and we started to go down, I saw someone. You went so fast up there, but... Wait for me! I was completely exhausted. My boots were completely bloody. I threw away the repair things. But I could not be separated from the stones. Olle! Why did not you say earlier? -I do not know. It was not the real Olle. He had no backpack. Wake him. The chimney. The sound coming from the chimney. Damn. There is so much snow here. There is no point. He is not here. We continue to go! Parasite. Idiot. People like you were shot during the war. Stealing militia firewood! Bring it! Idiot! On the floor! Idiot! Only idiots here, every single one. What should I do with you? -Please call. Hell! Olle! These guest houses are closed, but there is a guest house opposite. One room is open and heated, you can stay there. All have gone. -But... -But what? Our passports, then? You can go now. The deal is completely meaningless. It has nothing. No one at the bus station, either. But there was a note that there is a bus tomorrow at noon. 14th Wondering if there ever been water here. What is this? Did you get the key? -No. I'm not going. -Did you hear? I'll stay. -Stay you with your smile... Open it. ... burjat, if you want. Damn, a guitar! -Play something. -Wait. Where were you in? I'm here! He must not come here! Where is the key? We need to unlock! -Anne! Where's the key? Anne! He does not want you. Why did she look like? Indrek, open it. Damn, a guitar. -Play something. -Wait. Go back! Do not come any closer! Stay there! Go back to the hotel! Fotik, stop walking and running. Work! Whose are these? -My. Well... And what is this? Thank God for our people came through the mountain pass. They found him there. He was not even covered with snow. But we were not there. He saw that we were not there. -Stop speak German! You looked after, right? You saw, right? -Shut up! Thanks, fotik. But where have you confines state? I do not know. -Do not you know? -No. Of course you do, because there was no state. You have a big problem. You lie. Your friend's face was smashed. -What? -AT hell, that's what it is. Fucking geologists! Now listen to me carefully. You will stay here. Until the autopsy is complete and we have made an inquiry. How and exactly why your friend died. Is that understood? Do not do anything stupid. People's harsh up here. What bullshit! "Tough people up here!" How could he not be in the snow? -He is lying. Who beat him? -I do not know! But he was full of shit! How do we know where they found him? Why did not we see the body? Do not tell this to the other. -Are you in? -Why not? Why? We need not panic here. -Did you have a clash there? -Vadå? -Hoppade he at you again? Are you an idiot? -Are you nuts? -Calm down. I was just asking. Why do you buy that shit? It was only cigarettes. It is soothing tablets. They help me to sleep. Why did you take so much to you? Why cast not your stones? What does it matter now? What is this? I told you that there is something. He is not dead. Damn... What's wrong with me? Sorry, you have no other cigarettes? Do you have a phone? Go away! Why is the door open? This shit should keep it closed. If we are gone, the door is closed! Where is Marleen? Marleen! Are you there? Marleen? What are you doing there? Now we are entering. I do not follow. -Why not? You do not know what happened. They think that it is your and my fault. Who believes that? -Anne and Margus. -Let's go. -Gillade me at least a little bit... -... or did you just disrupt Olle? -Up to you, let's go in. Margus has soothing all the time. He is completely gone. He was talking about you and me and the haunting climber up there. What? -Margus said that if you had apologized had not happened. And now you have to go and ask forgiveness from Olle for us to come here. -Go out now! It's so awful. Who put the cat in the jar? I would not be here with these cowards. Where are the onions? How much did he? You kissed Marleen. I saw it. What are you babbling about? -I feel bad. Why did you leave me there? In the snow... They have not taken a hit Olle. And this is not me. And who are you? I went to the sacred forest. When we parted from you for the waterfall we ran into a strange place. It hung ribbons on the trees. This was the sacred forest. And? -How do Margus? I have not said anything. -God, then Olle done it! Why do you have this super grieving face all the time? And you, Marleen, not whining! What the hell...? Hello? It does not seem to be anyone there. -Damn. -Stängt also. Where is everyone? Damn. They must be somewhere. Are not you cold? What? Hello! What should we tell his mother? Killer! Why did you kill your own German in the mountains? -You should all get soon! -Silent! Do not move! Thieves! Thieves! Close the door! What do you want? They broke our window yesterday. One of us is sick. We need a doctor. Have you taken him away? -Who then? -Your friend. -Where? -To mortuary. -I do not understand. -Go there, just. -Where? What is it you do not understand? Let's go. How are we doing, guys. Take hold of the rope and pull him to the morgue. Roger? -We? -What else? I? He is your friend. A surgeon must determine the cause of death. Where's the surgeon? -Where! I'm so sick of your questions! You stand there with your dead faces, waiting for I do not know what! And what should I do? 20 years in this dungeon to rot! There was nothing here before. And now we perestroika! And what do we get? Dead links, no transport, no pay. It does not leave his people. And no crying. Who are you people? Marleen, go back. Do not come here! Do they even examined him? Ints, go to the hotel. Anne Stay away from here. How do they know that he's been broken? What are you looking at? Go and say something to them. -So she's not here. What should we do with her? Keep her away only! - Go! -What are you doing? He is fierce. I have not touched a dead body before. I have. In school. What's the talk that he was beaten? I would like to see his face. Can you take a look? Do you dare? One hand is on her face. Oh my God! As the ice only. As if there is something face. -God... -Because he has no face... What is it? Olle's mitt. His ring. Go to the hotel. Do not tell anybody. Stay here. Go. -Where are you going? I'm looking up the hospital. -Alone? It must be normal people there! I find a car or the hospital. Eero! Open! -Open! -Wait! -Put it there! -What has happened? -What has happened? Tell! -Wait! What have they done to you? Let me see! Who did this? Let me see! -Stop! -Tell! They hit me. -Who? -Which? -I do not know. -Show me... -Away! Will anyone? Just... Do not do it! It is not as dangerous as it looks. You deserved it. Can you hear me? You deserved it! Shut up, you fucking whore! Do not you think I see you waving the ass here? First Olle, now Eero. Are you happy? Why did you say to your partner to lie to us? If the beating. Why? I'll tell everything to the militia. What should you say to them? Do not touch me! You should not touch me! Do you not believe that I understand what they are shouting at us? Tell the truth. Why were you not by Olle? Why were you there just? What did you do with him? The two of you were there long. Why did you tell him no? Why were you not? What happened there? What are these issues? I myself was buried in snow. Who beat him? Your haunting mountain climbers? Wait... Do you really think... That I... Stop it... I wanted us to have fun here. How could I know that someone would take it that way? I do not know what happened there on the slopes. And I have not beaten anybody. I could have died there. But do not you care about. Do you hear... The last thing we need is that we fight amongst themselves. Now go and get him. They have taken him. Well, the Germans, the shit you on you? Let's go. No electricity again. A true idiot country. Here is wood. Why are you standing there? Come in! What you staring at? Are you afraid of the dead? Dry matches too. You should be afraid of those who are living. Go ahead stove to melt the bodies until tomorrow and we can do the autopsy. -What did he say? We'll warm up the room. He melts until tomorrow, and then we will do the autopsy. Do you understand? -Here, ignition. -Wait... I'll talk to you tomorrow morning. Light the stove! We turned the wrong somewhere. We'll go to the right. -No. This village is to hell! What are you yelling? Where did you disappear? You left me alone. -Margus, you know where the hotel is? -Are you nuts? It's right here. At the bottom of the street. Close the door! Passports! Where are the passports? I found it. A safety deposit box. The key! Oh my God... So... You do not fire in the stove? Why not? We are young and afraid of the dead. We intend to complain about you. -Complain? For whom? And where? -I Moscow. -In Moscow! All picks nephritis. It is not prohibited. But what is this? Now I understand why Buriats hiding. -It is not ours. -It was your leader's pocket. You move not in the mountains! They are sacred to them! Where's the rest? We have nothing. Liar! All yellows know where you have got hold of it. Wait. Give it to me. We will not be here. He lets us do not. Fotik, where did you get it? How did you get it? - The bastard has the camera! Let me out! Assholes! It does not lock up people like this! Give me my camera! Come here! Eero, help me! What are you looking at? What is wrong with you? Silent! Did you break something you will have to stay in the morgue! Fucking fagots! Talk Russian! Fascists! I'll kill you all! Damn, I fell asleep. I can not hold me anymore. I told you to pee in the sink yesterday. -I can not! -Then you get to pee in his pants. Come here, I hold up the blanket. Eero, there are people there! Look! Up, dammit! -What is it? -A Volga. The heads! Hello there! Help us! They do not hear us! -Do place! Help us! What's that? Holy rock crystal? What nonsense. It's my camera. -Take it, then. Take it. Comrade Skvortsov, why have not you reported them to Irkutsk? How? The line is dead. And what are your car to? Well then... The autopsy will be conducted today. On overthrown. But you come with us to Irkutsk in the morning. We will arrange that. I do not have people. -Vadå? Which tie straps? Wild animals? What is it superstition? Lenin is abused... The straps should not be touched. They'll be mad. If you are infected with this crap too? Please, we should not do it. There are few Russians in the village. You go to the morgue and obtain documents. And we will take care of you here. Why are you standing here? Help me, he's so big. I'm not going to go in there. Have we mesh well? I do not do it! We must do something! -I get that. I do not go in there. -What are we going to do then? You should not yell at them. The bodies are dead, but their spirits are here. We bury them in the spring, when they get quiet. Go talk to him! What are you afraid of? He stole our rock. You will quickly find out everything. -Lets go out! But where's the surgeon? I am a surgeon! Go! I thought nephritis would be more beautiful. A gemstone that does not sparkle... Reach? The haunting climber was there, but for me it was you. Damn! You fell and put the snow in motion. Nothing would have happened if you had not done it. Then had not happened. Yes... You were right, militia man was lying. Nobody beat me, it's fall injuries. Good boy. The body does not have time to melt completely. They said it would go away. Help me. Take the bucket and pour the water. With warm water, he becomes soft enough. We turn on him. Did you see? We hoped it would end there. That we would have a cause of death and papers the morning after. It was a real... A party, or... It was four o'clock in the night. We wish he had died instantly. When he was buried under snow. It would not be that if we had been more, so... So that his death had been our fault. Then it had not persecuted us. It was a conscious orgy. I have never been so full, before or since. Get up! Then you complained to us, your assholes! -Folket from Irkutsk... -Who? The drug is! Nobody cares here! We lowered your shit from the mountains. We got something please? Haddock, they are psychos! Let's go! What are you, crazy pans? It is the Germans' fault! Buriats! They will kill us! Damn! We're smoked. It's over now. A stranger burjat came to the autopsy report to us. We were told that Olle had suffocated to death in the snow. He had only lived 15 minutes. There was no investigation of his case. Neither in Estonia or Siberia because Olle's mother did not submit anything pleadings. Thank you for taking my son home. What fine friends. I knew it would happen. I washed even Olles clothes. We did so that he was fine. I did not want to dear Olle would leave us with an ugly face. He was a different guy there. For fixed. I thought about how much this trip has changed me. Or has not changed me. It was a twist of fate that we ended up on this journey. Yes, it's a shame. Marleen was a good doctor and a good mother. Margus found his calling in the travel industry. Indrek working in the public sector and like to hike with the family. Anne's prototype did not remember the trip or something would be told about her. Eero made the film we have just seen. Translation: Frederick Papp
