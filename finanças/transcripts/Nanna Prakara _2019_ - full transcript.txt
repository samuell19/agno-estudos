As per him he met her at party and they love each other. But finally they quarrelled due to marriage proposal. What surprises me is, the girl who was suppose to get married to Suman today. Why was she torturing Vishal to marry her? Was she blackmailing him for money? On what basis she was getting married someone When she was five months pregnant? What? Pregnant?

Do you know Vismaya's address Amrutha? I can check with the hospital. If Vismaya Suresh drived the car How did Vismaya replace Vismaya Suresh's place? Vismaya could have been to that apartment Their something could have happened. To escape from that she could have come to basement. As per Vishal he forgot key in car She saw that key and she drove the car. You could be right. But we found Vismaya body what about Vismaya Suresh? Kumar! Where is the accident car? Sir it is at accident spot. Due to heavy rain and As it is fallen deep we are not able to lift it up. Did you verify the boot space of the car? We tried sir but the boot space is jammed.

As we found Vismaya Suresh body What Vishal said was true. Why Vismaya drove his car? Amrutha! How do you know Vismaya and Suman? Dr. Sathish How is the patient condition? We examined sugar level and it is high And sent blood for investigation. Report will come now. You please examine once madam. What's the BP reading? 118/60. Ok will wait for the blood report Just stabilise the patient until then. When I checked patient blood report, I got to know she had type 1 diabetic's myelitis. One who has type 1 diabetic Required amount insulin is not produced. Because of the high level Blood sugar in body. In this case, because of type 1 diabetic, She lost both the kidneys. That patient is none other than Vismaya. If she had to survive, she had only one option She needed live organ donor to donate one kidney. That is when Suman came into her life As a lamp in darkness. Madam Suman come here. According to HLA report. It's positive in Blood matching, cross matching and tissue matching. So you can donate kidney. Is there any blood relationship between you and Vismaya? No Madam. She is very closely known to me Because of her my mother is still alive. Vismaya saved your mother's life So you're giving life to her! Yes Madam. Today my mother is alive because of Vismaya. If today I give life to Vismaya Tomorrow so many people will get help from her. You should think about your future. Madam future is not a big deal for me Compared to who saved my mother's life. You prepare everything for operation madam. Doctor how is he now? He cannot talk now Amrutha Due to head injury his nervous system is disturbed. He is able to listen our voice and He will understand but he cannot talk. Suman I am Dr. Amrutha Do you remember me? He cannot talk Amrutha. I know, but is he able to write? We could try. Give me pen if you do have. Suman. How do know Vismaya? How did this accident happen? One day I bought saree for a festival to mom My mother was not to be seen. While I was searching her. My neighbour informed me about My mother getting admitted in hospital. Immediately I went to hospital. I felt lost when I saw her sleeping Like that on the hospital bed. When I went to meet the doctor To enquire about my mother's health. What happen to her sir? What's your relationship with her? I am her son Suman. She had cardiac arrest So we operated her immediately. Those who admitted your mom, They have paid all the bills. Who admitted her sir? I do not know who that is But will check from the visiting card they gave. This is the their card. They paid all expenses and helped mom for operation. So went in search of them to meet. Hello Sir! Is Vismaya madam there? Oh Vismaya madam is it. Wait here, will call you! Go inside Madam is there. Is she Vismaya? Did she admit mom to hospital? I have seen her before somewhere. Are you Shardamma son? When I was coming on my way, When I happen to see who it was It was Shardamma. Immediately I admitted her to hospital But doctors told she needs surgery. So I arranged money from our Ashram And paid the bills that's it. Thank you very much for your help Madam. If it was not you, I do not know Whether I would have met her alive. Thank you so much of your help I will not forget your help madam. Thank you. I have nothing to do Sir God has helped for your good kind heart.
