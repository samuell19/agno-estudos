Dear God. What now? Get up. – It's too early. You've got an interview in one hour. A job will provide you with social security, a pension... You're not that young any more. Stop repeating that. I don't want you to work as a waitress. Eat. Here is the address of the man you're supposed to meet. Aunt Ellie's neighbor. He told her that he'll get you a job. What kind of job? You'll see for yourself. I don't want to go. It's humiliating. Every time is the same. I'll get there, wait with his secretary, he'll see me and then: nothing. He hasn't got a secretary. You want me to be a secretary? No. I just want you to wear something nice. Mum, I'm your daughter. I came out of your vagina. Am I that ugly to you? You're pretty. But fat, right? Get dressed. You're beautiful. Have mercy. If not on me, at least on your father. Get dressed. I feel free when I'm naked. If you ask me, I'd stay naked all day. And you would freeze to death. That's my girl. Stop. I need to tell you something. What's wrong with you? – Nothing. Go home. You're embarrassing me. – I don't care. You hear me? I'll scream. – Go ahead. Go home. I didn't do anything. – You hear me? Go. I mind my own business. – Stop. I wanted to speak to you. Wait, please. You hear me? What? What? Stop. Go home. Go home. – No. Then I will. – Don't go. Don't tell them your exact age. Tell them you're 24 or 25. Mum, please stop. – 25. Stop it, mother. – 25. Just leave. Leave. Shut up. 25 sounds better. There, I'm leaving. Why are you so happy? He's taking me on holiday. You don't say. Life is not a fairy tale. It could be. What is it now? He's got a wife and three kids. Enough now! You hope he'll leave them for you. A desperate secretary. I'm not his secretary. I run the boutique. You call this a boutique? A little envious, huh? Envious of you? You're ruining a family, a sacred entity of God. A sacred entity? Wow. What's the matter with you today? Since when do you care, talking about God and bullshit like that? Give me a break. Idiot. Since last night. Congrats. I'm not that desperate, you know? I'm sorry, ok? I am. I'm sorry, ok? – Let's hear it again. I'm sorry. This time I want something different. I want a dress. You're full of surprises. Try some new tricks at this interview today. Tell them that your name is Pepi. Or Pippy. Petra would totally fit you. My name is Petrunya. What's wrong with that? Hi, grandma. Good afternoon. Ok. So, you want a dress. Some of them are really pretty. Yeah. I'll put them online. Maybe 300 euros each. Soon there will be no space to get laid. Want to hear a story? Sure. Once upon a time, in Rome, there lived a virgin. It was time for her to be married. Actually, a guy wanted to marry her, but her father refused. He wanted her to remain a virgin. He decided to make her ill, and when she got better, he did it again. This went on and on, until she died a virgin and became a saint. So, the father was a dickhead? Totally. Want to know her name? Petrunya. Are you a virgin too? These will fit you too. But that's a male head. She'd be happier like this. He's mine. Don't leave a mess. It's already a mess. But it's my mess. Excuse me, where is the manager? Looking for a job, huh? Have a seat. What is it? Cat got your tongue? I'm looking for a job. Can you sew clothes? So, why are you here? I... I'm looking for a job as a secretary. Right. So? I'm Petrunya Eftimovska, Eleonora Georgievska sent me. She's my aunt. Eleonora Georgievska. Who is she? I think that she's your neighbor. She told me you were younger. Tell me. What can I do for you? I need someone who places orders, knows accounting and makes me coffee, if needed. Can you do that? – I think I can. You can or you think you can? I can make coffee and add numbers. Any prior training? I've got a university degree. Any training for office work? No. I'm an historian. An historian. What can I do with an historian? Where are you going? Sit down. Come on, sit. I'm fooling with you. I know who you are. Previous experience? I haven't got any. None? None. You mean zero? – Yes, zero. How old are you? Twenty... I'm 32. You look 42. Zero work experience. How come? It's hard to find a job as an historian. Right. You could have worked a different job. I have had a different job. Let me guess, a waitress? Look... I'm not some dickhead. Your aunt is a nice woman. But you should know... This just won't work. You can't sew. No work experience. Never worked in an office. You also look awful. I wouldn't even fuck you. And the position is already taken. Your boss is a real asshole. – What? Nothing. Baby. Where are you going, baby? Hallelujah. We praise You, Lord. Lord, have mercy on us. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. In ancient times, today's holiday was celebrated with Christmas, the birth of our Savior Jesus Christ. But it was not just the Holy Spirit... Come on, Father. Throw the cross. Throw it, Father. Look at her, across the river. Maybe it's Jesus. Our Lord Jesus Christ spent His life praising the Holy Father. He surrendered to the divine plan for mankind. We praise Your greatness, Lord. Your ways are strange, and no words could describe Your wonders. We praise Your greatness, Lord. Your ways are strange and no words could describe Your wonders. Come on. No words could describe Your wonders. Come on, Father. – Absurd. It's cold, Father. We're freezing. ...to bless this water. – Amen. Throw the cross already. – Come on! Where did he throw it? There it is. You go, girl. – Bravo. Give the cross back. You hear me? Where do you think you're going? Give the cross back. Did you hear what I said? Give it back. A real disgrace. Shame on you. Give it back. I caught it. A real disgrace. Give the cross back. She caught it. Right now. Come on, Father. The cross is ours, Father. We caught it. Others jumped from under the bridge. It's ours. Ours. May you live long and prosper. Next year, we'll catch it again. See you at the pub tonight. Easy, easy. Calm down. Don't shout so much. Who caught the cross? Where is the cross? I caught the cross. The cross is mine. If I'd jumped from there, it'd be mine. It wasn't just me. Father, she is a woman and mustn't jump for the cross. Calm down. What a classy lady. But soaked. Come on, let's change your clothes. Tradition confirms this, sir. I apologize, Father. But we mustn't forget that she was the first to swim to the cross. Now the police are looking for her. What are the laws governing this quite peculiar event? We are here with the Superintendent? Commander. The Commander of the local police. Mr. Milan Stojchevski, right? – Right. Please give us more details and information about this event. We've been called by Church officials. We're looking for the mysterious woman. When we find her and get the necessary information, we'll act in accordance to the law. Thank you. Get your things, we're going to the police station. Thank you. Pardon me, one more question. Please, hold this for a minute. And this. Is it really a problem that a woman caught the cross? How should I put this... Well, try. – I will. We teach the children that only men can jump for the cross. Who teaches them, the Church? The Church, the parents, everyone. But why? Religious canons state that only men can take part. I'm not sure if you understand me. No, I don't. – Come on, now. That is a part of... May I speak? If we stick to the tradition, we'll never progress. Madam. Miss Janeva. – My apologies, miss. This case is not important enough for you to cover. I'll be the judge of that. That's my job, right? Fine. If your job is to investigate mad women. And what's yours? A mob is chasing that woman and what are you doing? We'll do everything we can to find her. I'm not so sure about that. Thank you. Goodbye. – Bye. I was just telling your dad about your interview today. So, tell us. How did it go? It was okay. He laughed when I told him I majored in History. Great. Don't worry, dear. And? Breaking news. The traditional ceremony of the cross was held in Shtip today, when an unprecedented scandal occurred. An unidentified woman jumped into the water and caught the cross. Our reporter is... They'll call me by Friday. Please, give us more details... I knew it. What happened exactly? Today, an unidentified woman caught the cross. Or, according to the angry crowd, stole the cross. But what really enraged the crowd, was her next move. The woman has been on the loose for two hours and the police are searching for her, with no results yet. The woman, or the fugitive, as the police describe her, wasn't prepared for the event. She jumped into the cold water wearing a dress. Surely, we'll find out more about her motives when the police find her. Open up. Petrunya. Go away. Open the door, I mean it. I'll break down the door. Open it. I told you to leave me alone. It's me, Blagica. Open up. – Is my mum with you? No. Open up, come on. Stop playing games. You hear me? The cross... Wait. What did you do? – Nothing. Oh, come on. I just want to see it. What do I do to get some luck from it? No idea. Should I just touch it like this, or maybe put it over my heart? It's pretty, though. Pretty, huh? You don't give a damn. You caught it. You'll have a year full of luck. You're insane. The whole town is looking for you. Everyone's up in arms. They'll take it away. It's mine. They disagree, honey. Screw them. Fine. Screw them. Someone made a video. You see? They've filmed you jumping. You're a champ. And you're super-cool, really. And then... Yeah, well... To me, you're brilliant. You've got so many likes. Guys will start chatting you up. You'll be popular. Is that your mum? I'll check. – No, don't. It's no biggie. I believe this is yours. – Yes. Thank you. – You're welcome. I thank you. Where is the cross? Don't stare at me. Where is the cross? Leave it. It's mine. Ungrateful monster. Piece of shit. This is a sacred thing. And it's not yours. You're a real monster. A monster. It's mine. You can't prove it's not. It's not yours. – Leave her alone. What's wrong with you? Ungrateful monster. Beat it. You can't prove that it's not mine. This sacred thing is not yours. Shut up. Piece of shit. – What do you want? It's not yours, you hear me? – Let me go. It's not yours. – Let me go. Beat it. – What the hell do you want? The cross. – Why? Vaska. – Shut your mouth. What now, huh? Forget it. I'll disown you. Vaska, stop. – Shut up. Give me the cross. I'll tear your hair out. Get the hell out. Beat it. I'll disown you, I swear to God. You disgrace. You animal. What will our neighbors say? God. Oh, God. Dear God. You care about the gossip? Fuck you all. You mediocre bitch. Easy. You'll kill her. That is not yours. I'm sick of you all. I'm sick of this place. Fuck you all. – Easy, Petrunya. I'll make you regret this. Why are you putting that on? To look pretty for you, Mum. Idiot. Where are you going? To Blagica's. Tell her. No, you're not. Great. What a friend. This is mine! Can you understand that? Police. Open the door. How could you? Good afternoon. – Good afternoon. Is Petrunya Eftimovska here? Come in, please. Good afternoon. Petrunya? That's me. Your ID, please. Thank you. Boss? -Yes? We've found her. -Go on. Petrunya Eftimovska. -Copy. The address: St Ivan Ribar Lola, 153. 153? -Right. The ID number is 1504986455125. Check. That's the one. -All right. Over and out. Miss. We ask that you accompany us to the police station. The commander would like to see you. Get ready for an interrogation. – Okay. The cross. Lady, have you got the cross? – It's here. Let's see it. All right. Wrap it up, please. Sorry. Will you get to work? Fine, let's start. Madam, please. What's your opinion on the woman who caught the cross today? You go to hell. Thank you, madam. Hello. – Good afternoon. May I ask you a question? We're from Channel Plus. – Yes. Can you stand over there? All right. What's your opinion on the woman who caught the cross today? The woman who caught the cross? – Yes. How about figuring out the governmental criminals? Our people barely make ends meet. Who cares about this cross thing? Thanks. Have a nice day. – Thank you. Great. Everyone's not crazy, huh. What's so important? A football match. You mean betting? Try living on my salary. I am. Think my salary is higher than yours? What a joke. Hello? No, I'm not in Skopje. Blagoja, I'm not in Skopje. Don't you yell at me. What? No, you're supposed to pick her up. That was the deal. No, I'm not in Skopje. Blagoja, she's your daughter, too. Don't be late. Trouble in paradise, huh? Let's go. Excuse me. Why did you catch the cross? Will you return it? Is it yours even if you're a woman? Please, step back. Is this discrimination against women? Step back. – Please. May I know her name? What's her name? Petrunya. Now leave. What's the matter? I'm wondering what's going on. We told you to wait. I've been waiting too long. What is my status? What status? Why am I here? You were told. You know why you're here. – The report. Am I under arrest? Is there a problem? If I'm not, I can go. Call the priest, please. Who said you could go? Nobody read me my rights. She thinks we're on a TV show. You should have thought before jumping. Father. Leave the phone. Let's settle this first. Should've thought before jumping. Am I under arrest? Be patient. We'll interrogate you soon. You think you're so smart. We've got rules here. May I have a glass of water? Yes. Just a second. Hello? Mum, I told you that I can't talk now. Can you imagine the Archbishop's outrage? He fears that this fiasco is a blasphemous desecration of our sacred tradition. I can imagine. And he's right. Easy there. It's quite strong. Cheers. Kosta. You know that you can't force her to return the cross, right? Milan, you've got to understand. She broke the rules. Father, what rules? She's a woman. Petrunya Eftimovska, you've got a call. What do you mean? On the phone. Follow me. Hello? – Petrunya? Yes. – It's Slavica Janeva, the reporter. Remember me? Turn to your right. I'm by the door. To your right. Good. Listen, I'm here to help you. I need some information. I know nothing. I don't want to talk. Wait. Are you under arrest? I don't know. I don't think so. Listen to me. If you're not under arrest, they've got no right to keep you there. Trust me. Ask them if... Leave me alone, please. – Wait. Now, listen... – Go on. You need to file a report saying that she stole your cross, and a claim for its return. Hold on. Saying what? Listen. – I know. Please. She didn't steal it. Don't force me to lie. – Fine. She jumped and caught the cross. Everyone saw it. Fine. – So, I'm supposed to lie? I have got to follow God's rules. Kosta. I have to follow common law, get it? We live in a legal state, right? Man, I can't start the procedure without that. I'll have to let her go. Kosta. We should be in Skopje. This is where things happen. Like betting? Oh, come on. Listen. You need to focus. This thing might be our big chance. What's so funny? I'm serious. Your big chance. No. A chance for you and for me. You see what's happening? What a circus. We must open the eyes of the public. May I get a statement? Hello. I'm the police Commander. Petrunya. My child, I'm really sorry about this misunderstanding. But this may still end well if you return what is not yours. Will the police talk to me, or am I in a church? Let's go. To your left. The ID? – Yes, there. State your name, surname, date of birth, education. Petrunya Eftimovska, 15.04.86... Slow down. Date of birth? April 15, 1986. I majored in History. All right. Employment? – I'm unemployed. Married? No. All right. So? What happened at the river today? You obviously know that. Miss, please. Answer the question. I caught the holy cross. The priest says that you've stolen it. The event went viral. You can check it. There is a video of it on YouTube. Miss. Are you religious? How is that relevant? – Please. Just answer the question. Are you gay? Are you aware of your situation? Very aware. I'm not answering personal questions. I don't even have to speak to you. Am I under arrest or not? All right. As you wish. Sit down. Is that a button missing? Sorry. I'll fix it. Darko. Stay here. Vasil. Vasil. Find him. Come here. Darko? – Hey. Why is it so dark in here? I'm saving electricity. Does this camera work? – Yes. Let's carry on, shall we? – Sure. You've broken all the rules. Do you realize that? What rules? – Don't act naive. Only men jump for the cross. You're playing stupid. I didn't know the rules. That's the rule. But it's not a law. Not a law, you say? Well, it's not. The Church wants its cross back. So, why am I at the police station? Darko. Leave the room, please. Have you been on TV? Well, this is not TV. I have a daughter. She's nine. Her name is Dora. She's polite, well-behaved and pretty. But if I see her behaving like you when she's older, I'll break each bone in her body. Luckily, my father stands by me. Do you know the story about the wolf and the sheep? Hello. Ever heard that story? The wolf ate the sheep, I get it. No. The sheep dressed like a wolf and they beat the shit out of it. Wasn't it the other way round? No. The sheep dressed like a wolf and enjoyed fooling everyone. You stupid cow. You're fucking around with me? Fuck you. That cross is sacred. What am I going to tell the priest now? No, I've already had coffee. This won't take long. I'm sorry about your daughter's situation. She didn't do anything wrong. I believe you. That is obvious. But please repeat that for the camera. Ready? Look at me, not at the camera. As if there's no camera in the room. And feel free to show emotion. The people are on your side. They're aware of this injustice. Ready? Microphone. The Eftimovi family, right? – Yes. Vaska and Stojan. – Eftimovski. Eftimovski. We are at the home of Petrunya Eftimova. With us are her parents, Vaska and Stojan Eftimovi. Thank you for being with us tonight. Were you aware of your daughter's plan to participate in the traditional ceremony? I suppose she trained hard. What are your views on her act? Fighting the establishment or opposing gender discrimination? A sheer coincidence or a clearly defiant act? Petrunya is a good, clever and hardworking young woman. Unfortunately, like most of her peers, she's also unemployed. She... – Also, she majored in History and was a straight-A student. So she's unemployed. – That's right. This might feel like a personal question, but it's very important. Is your family religious? No. – Yes. We observe all of the religious holidays. We can conclude that you were never informed that Petrunya intended to participate in the ceremony. Also, she is not very religious. What is your opinion then? Why did she do it? I've spent my life providing for a better future. A better life for my child. Do you see what's going on? Total nonsense. How can I rest in peace, knowing that she's in this mess? So, Petrunya lives with you here. But... Does she have a boyfriend? She needs a job. She's a diligent, hardworking girl. I know that there are good people who watch this TV program. Please, give my daughter a job. She never meant to do any harm. She needs a job. Thank you. Stop it, Vaska. So, Petrunya is in need of a job. Right? – Yes. This would be at the end. Ready? So... I'm sorry. Tonight, we talked to Petrunya's parents. Petrunya is the girl who caught the holy cross in Shtip. They are also surprised by her act and plead for an employment for her. For them, that is the only problem Petrunya faces. It's pretty, right? Why did you do this? – For luck. Wouldn't you do the same? Fine. Put it away. You can hold it. No, thank you. Aren't you religious? I am, but that's different. How? I'm not a fanatic like you. I am not one either. Then why did you jump for the cross? I don't know why. But... Was it supposed to be a provocation? Yes. A provocation. Really? I just don't get it. You think that the police have nothing else to do but waste time with your jumping for some cross? First, I caught the cross. Second, I agree with you. You have much more important things to do. I will... Yes, her father is late. He had an emergency. He's coming now. This is the last time, I promise. Ok. Thank you so much. Thanks. Bye. Listen. This is the last time I'm saving your ass. I'm sick of you. I'm... Screw you. What? Mind your own business. What is it, Brad Pitt? I'm so pretty, huh? Asshole. Where is she? – Think she's inside? Where is everyone? They're coming. Come on. – Excuse me. May I have your statement regarding today's event? Sure. Ready? We're at the police station in Shtip, where a group of citizens has gathered. Today, they participated in the competition for the cross. Let's hear their statements about the winner. Well? That woman is Lucifer in the flesh. She's not the winner. She stole the cross and we want it back. But she was the fastest. You can't refute that fact. Let me explain. God said that stealing is a sin, right? Thieves used to be stoned. And slaughtered. – Yeah. We won't leave here until she returns the cross. She stole it. We want it back. Excuse me. Ready for a second question? – Yes. We were informed that last year's winner was also a woman. Your comments, please. No. This is the first time that a woman has won. Really? – Yes. So, you've just confirmed that a woman caught the cross. Right? – No. You've just confirmed it. I didn't. She stole it. You're free to go. Come on. Are you sure? Miss, please. Miss. Please leave. All right. Your rucksack. Could we talk again? No, I'm going home. My child, I'm going too. We're all children of God, don't forget that. You're also in the heart of God. God watches over you. He will forgive you no matter what. The Church will also help you, so you can marry for free. Just one question. Did you return the cross? Is it here? Whore. Come here. Give us the cross. Give it back. I'll bring you a towel. Petrunya. The people must find out. What people? The people out there. They poured water on her. A crowd cannot have an opinion. It's a herd. Please, repeat that for the camera. That's my cameraman. I can call him. Will you repeat that? You'll have to stay here for a while. We have to manage this situation, ok? Father. You've got to be strong and make a statement. You need to leave. Who? – You. Why? Who said that? He did? No, I'm telling you that. Does he call the shots? No. I'm staying with her. You must leave. – Don't touch me. No violence. – I apologize. If I go, she goes with me. She is not leaving. You go. Open up. Open it. Whore. Whore. Darko. Where are the blankets? Blankets? – Yes. What for? – It's too early for bedtime. Hey Darko! What's with the blanket? The girl is wet. And she's cold. So put the heater to maximum. It's not our job to keep her warm. Darko, man. You're on TV. Here's her "Prince Warming". I think that she was asking for it. She reaped what she sowed. What do you want? Nothing. Are you cold? Here, take this. You think I should speak to her? To whom? The reporter. I don't know. Everyone likes watching TV, so it might be helpful. You think I need help? Frankly, I don't know. I never meant to cause trouble. That doesn't matter. It's none of my business. You're lucky. You've got a job and all. Jackpot. Have you seen who I work with? I wish I had your courage. There was no courage. I jumped without thinking. Like an animal. Like what? I feel like... Like an animal. Put this on, so you don't freeze. No, to me it's scandalous that they made a fuss because the winner is a woman. Like we're still in the Dark Ages. The plot is quite clear. What do you mean? Don't you see the obvious patriarchal order? Don't you feel the male dominance, excused by tradition? We want to see the priest. No, listen. Our duty is to inform the public. Don't you think so? No. Even if nobody likes it. No, this is the reality. We must inform the public about it. It doesn't matter whose fault it is, got it? We're lucky that she didn't ask for a lawyer. So, get on your feet and go and tell that crowd to leave. So I can let her go. To face that herd? – Yes. And then what? – Tell them to go home. You do it. Oh, really? – Yes. You were the one who talked about danger in my office. Don't tell me about danger. Kosta, you're risking your own neck. You have five minutes to make them leave, or I'll start arresting them. Do you realize what you've done? Shame on you. Girl. Come on. Let's go. Please. I understand you, but you have to understand me too. Calm down and go home. No, we don't believe you! Yeah, right. We saw that she has the cross. That's right. Didn't you hear what I said? Go home. We'll get the cross tomorrow. History, huh? Favorite historical period? I bet it's Alexander the Great. The Chinese Revolution. Aren't you interested in our history? No. I'm interested in communism integration into democratic structures. Today we strive for more equal... Petrunya. Let me ask you a question. I'm not very religious, but I'd really like to see that cross. If possible. All right. Easy... I'm sorry, but my job is to protect you. The cross is mine. I already told you that it wasn't me. Look at her. – Sit down. Why didn't you put her in a cell? Shut up and don't move. Once upon a time, there lived a princess. She was a spoiled snob, a boorish, frustrated spinster. Bitch. Whore. You stole my cross, huh? May you rot in hell with it. Whore. Slut. Hey, shut up. Bitch. You bitch. – What do you want, fucker? You think you sit on a throne, huh? Calm down. You piece of shit. Fuck off. You, here? Forgive me, my child. You can't leave. The prosecutor is coming to handle this. Please. Please, may I come in? I won't be long. I'm her mother. All right. Be quick. Thanks. Where did you get this jacket? The color is revolting. It's all wrong for your skin tone. Why did you say this? Say what? Mum, I'm worthwhile. Eat. Why are you stalking me? I don't get you. – Is that so? I'm asking you why you are always stalking me. I'm not. It's not true. What about this morning? Oh, that. Just a tiny reminder of your age. I'm 32. Why don't you just see that I am capable and worthwhile? I'm not leaving. Fuck you, asshole. Hello? All right, I'm on my way. On your way, huh? Now, listen. You have the choice to leave. I stay. Got it? I've got to go, or I'll lose my job because of this mad woman. Mad? Now she's mad. All I hear are insults. Come on, stay. Let's finish the story. No. They told me to leave. Who told you? – The boss. So, you're leaving? – No choice. Then leave the camera. – No way. Leave it. – No. Leave it. I know how to use it. – No way. It's on lease. – So what? I'll sign for it. I've always helped you. I just can't. – Your phone. Hello? – That's right. Bow to your boss. "Sure, I'll bring the camera". She wants to take my camera. "She will take it because he's a pussy". Leave the camera here. Beat it. Just for the record, you're sacked. Beat it. Hey, turn around for a sec. Yeah. – Fine. Goodbye. Suck my dick. Suck it. Asshole. Asshole. The singing contest. – What? You remember that contest? No. I won first prize. I was only seven. I was so happy. The happiest child on Earth. Remember what you told me? Remember? Remember? – No. You told me that I'd won because you bribed the judge. That's not true. It is. What did you give him, mum? Leave me alone. "I gave the judge a little present". "A little present for the judge". I was only seven, mum. Only seven. Come on. There's no signal. No, I've... – No, no, no. Today, at the job interview... Yes? That man, the friend... He said that I'm worthless. He totally agrees with you. He even said that he wouldn't fuck me. Don't be so rude. I'm telling you, mum. You probably misunderstood him. He's a serious man. You mean he would fuck me? No signal. I've got to go. I need to call your father. He's very worried about you. I'm going to go now. You can't understand, but it's ok. I accept that. I really do. I'll be going now. You're still here? I've got to wait for the prosecutor. Is it really such a big deal that a woman caught the cross? The cross is not yours. It belongs to God.
