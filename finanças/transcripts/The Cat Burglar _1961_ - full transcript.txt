[MUSIC PLAYING] WOMAN: Good night, darling. MAN: Good night. Halt! Halt! [JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING] Hello, Alan. This is Nan. I just got back. Look, I've got to see you right away. [DOORBELL RINGING] Hi, sweetheart. Alan, I'm so glad to see you. I wanted you here before I phoned the police. The police? Someone stole my purse and briefcase. Okay, so wait a minute. Don't call, let's talk about this. It wasn't my fault. I know, sweetheart, but if you had called me at the airport, I'd had picked you up and this never would have happened. I wanted to surprise you. Well, you did that, all right. I'm sorry. All the way from Albuquerque, I kept worrying if I should have kept the briefcase with me instead of in the suitcase. Luggage does get lost sometimes. [SIGHS] This is a hell of a mess. How'd the thief get in? From the balcony. I was in the shower so I didn't hear him. Let's have a look. Man must have known what he was doing. Couldn't have made much noise. Honey, are those papers in the briefcase so terribly important? You'd never know how important. I've got to get them back. [KNOCK AT DOOR] Who is it? WOMAN: Well, who do you think it is? Santa Claus? Uh... Just a minute. [KNOCK AT DOOR] Just a minute! [KNOCKING CONTINUES] You don't have to knock the door down. [GRUNTS] What do you want? The rent, Jacky boy. Oh, brother. And the next time I have to come asking for it, you ain't going to be here to ask. Look at this mess. Don't you ever pick up after yourself? You live like a pig. Look at this! Will, will you take a look at this thing? Now, this has been rattling around for months. When are you going to get around to fixing it? Just as soon as I get a regular-paying tenant in here! All right, all right, go and insult me. One of these days I'll be moving out of this stinking joint anyway. Well... - Stinking joint, is it? - That's right. Now, well in that case, Jacky boy, you won't mind sleeping in the street tonight. And before you leave, clean up some of this trash that's laying around here. My boy will pick it up after school. Now wait a minute, Mrs. Prattle. -Prattle. [PRONOUNCES AS PRAY-TELL] - [JACK SIGHS] And if I don't get the rent by 6:00 tonight, out you go! And you go out with what you've got on your back... - And nothing else. - Look, now... You don't want to get mad over a little thing like... [CHUCKLES] What was it? $9, Mrs. Prattle? - Prattle! - Yes, ma'am. - Tonight! - Look, I don't know about tonight but I promise you by tomorrow I'll get for you. Yeah, how many times I've heard that before. I mean it! Well, all right... - Tomorrow it is then. - All right. But brother, you'd better have it. Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. You have my word on it. Yeah, well that and a dime will get me a cup of coffee. Brother. Thank you, Mrs. Prattle. Crummy old goat. [GRUNTING] [CHUCKLES] [SIGHS] [SCOFFS] Ah, maybe it'll pay the rent anyway. MAN: So you sent the girl to New Mexico to pick up the papers. That wasn't very intelligent, Alan. I thought it would be safer. MAN: Safer? For whom? You know, Alan, it was men like you who cost us our victory. Stop making a federal case out of this, Taylor. We'll get your papers back or another set, so stop worrying, will you? [TAYLOR SIGHS] If those papers fall into the wrong hands, my dear Sheridan, a federal case is exactly what it will be! And as for getting duplicates, I'm afraid that will be impossible. What do you mean? Yeah! Look at this! Seems to me that wasn't very intelligent. Don't mock me, Alan. It isn't wise. A year's work has gone into getting that fuel formula and plans for the new propulsion unit. I don't intend for that time and effort to go to waste. You ought to read your own propaganda, Taylor. Your people are supposed to have ICBMs that will outperform anything we've got. Now you hear me, Alan. I'm supposed to deliver those plans over the weekend. Your obituary would make a poor substitute. Look, Taylor, be reasonable, I'm doing everything I can to get those papers back. Ah! Such as? - Nan is in contact... - That girl again! Tell me something, Alan, if she means so much to you, how could you endanger her life? And ours by having her act as an unsuspecting courier. She's not in any danger and never has been. That remains to be seen. We'll keep in touch, Alan. You have until the end of the week. [SULTRY MUSIC PLAYING] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Yeah? Hello, are you Mr. Muskie? Who wants to know? You one of them snoopy welfare dames? I'm looking for something that I lost. Well, this ain't no Lost and Found. I'm willing to pay for any help you can give me. You're beginning to interest me, lady. Come on in. Sit yourself down. [CHUCKLES] Don't worry. I'm only interested in wine. A little muscatel. Good for what ails ya. No, thank you. [EXHALES] Okay, lady, out with it. You want me to put you onto somebody who could clout something for you, is that it? Clout something? [SCOFFS] I'm sorry, lady. You talk and I'll listen. Well, it happened the other night. Someone stole some things from my apartment and I want them back. And I'm... I'm willing to pay for their return. Okay, turn your eyes in the other direction. Go on. Okay, lady, let's go. Let's get out of this dump. MAN: So where did you heist these? No, certainly not from you, otherwise I wouldn't be here with them. But what can I do with them? Well, just think, Pete, if anyone ever steals yours, then you'll be all set, with this set. Another set, huh? Come on, what am I offered? Yes, I'll take it. [CHUCKLES] Hello, Pete. What's on your mind, Muskie? She's all right. I've known her a long time. Some cat burglared her pad and got away with a couple of sentimentals. That's right, a gold and pearl heart locket, uh, some pearl earrings and my wristwatch, a 14-karat Bulova. Also there was a briefcase containing some papers in it too, with the letters "N.B." on it. My purse and wallet you could... You could forget about. Look, what did you bring her here for? You know I don't handle nothing hot. Sure, Pete, I know that. But, I... I figured you might just be able to hear something about it and maybe pick yourself up a nice piece of change helping out the lady. Please, all I want to do is get my things back. I'm willing to pay. I don't care about anything else, if that's what you're thinking. Just the briefcase and, and of course my jewelry. Look, Miss, you write down the name and the phone number and if I hear something, I'll call ya. [COUGHING] Oh, I don't know whether this will help but the thief really knew his business. He came down from the roof. Look, lady, I don't deal in people, just things. Hey, you pay me my money now, lady, and I'll be running along. I got an appointment with a jug. All right. [PHONE RINGING] Oh, there goes that thing again. Night and day that thing rings, never giving a minute's peace. Why, sometimes I think I ought to have this thing disconnected. [CLEARS THROAT] Prattle Motel. I want to talk to Jacky. [PETE COUGHING] No, he ain't here. He went out early this morning. PETE: This is important, are you sure now? What do you mean, am I sure? Listen, wise guy... All right, all right, don't get excited, lady. Who's excited? Who is excited? When that bum pays his rent, I'll take messages for him. Till then, you can tell Jack to drop dead! I got some money for Jack! Did you say... [CLEARS THROAT] Money? Yeah, just tell him Pete called. Tell him, I changed my mind and I'll help him out. - You got that? - Oh, yeah. [CHUCKLES] I'll certainly tell him, sir. And thank you for calling. - [PETE COUGHING] - You a friend of Jack's? Lovely boy, like my own son, he is. PETE: Yeah, all right, lady, goodbye. There you are, Jacko. 30 bucks, cash money. [SCOFFS] Listen, I don't get it. This morning you wouldn't give me 10 dollars for that stuff. So, I'm a good Samaritan. I give to ya out of the goodness of my heart. [JACK CHUCKLES] - So now you want to look in my mouth like a horse, huh? Good what? Samaritan? Pete, you'd sell your own mother and kick if you couldn't collect on the sales tax. Come on, now tell me, what's going on here? Well, it's like this. The lady you clouted the stuff from, she was around trying to get a line on it, see. So, what's wrong with everybody making a buck? - Wanted to buy it back, huh? - Yeah. How much is she going to pay you? Oh, if I'm lucky, I'll make ten bucks. [SCOFFS] That's the funniest thing I heard all day. I got to close up. It's 5:00 already. So if you get something good, come around, you know who your friends are, hmm? Yeah, they're all right here, Pete. [COUGHING] [DOOR CLOSING] Hello, Miss Baker. [KNOCK AT DOOR] He expects me to be alone. Take your cup and go in there. [KNOCKING CONTINUES] Hello, Miss Baker. You sure are in luck, lady. [CHUCKLES] Are we alone? Yes. I had to pay plenty to get that stuff back, lady. Plenty. Are you, uh, sure it's mine? Ah, yeah, look, here I show ya, see. There's the initials, "N.B." What a relief. Oh, I can't thank you enough. Well, just give me the hundred bucks, lady, that's all the thanks I need. I... I put the jewelry inside. [CLEARS THROAT] NAN: Where's the notebook? PETE: You asked me to get that junk for you, lady, I got it. I don't know nothing about any notebook. Well, it was here in the briefcase. What are you trying to do? Put a fast one over on me, sister? I want my money and I want it now! Not until everything is returned and that includes the notebook. Okay, I'll make a deal with ya. I paid 50 for that junk. Just give me what I paid. NAN: Not without the notebook. All right, forget it. I'll take the stuff back. Just a minute, Mister! Hey, what's this all about? You said we was alone! You think I'd leave any woman in a room alone with dirt like you? Now don't get rough with me, Mister. I'll have the law on ya. Alan, please. Don't worry, honey, I wouldn't dirty my hands. You'd better not. How much time do they give for receiving stolen property these days, friend? Oh, no, you wouldn't do that, Mister, huh? I was only trying to do the lady a favor. Still want the hundred dollars? There must be something important about that notebook. What is it? What's in it? Nan, phone the police. No, no, no, no. I was only kidding. You can't blame a guy for trying to make a buck, huh? The name of the thief and where we'd find him. Okay, okay. First, I want my money. The guy's name is, uh, Jack. I don't know the last name. Honest, Mister, I'm levelling with ya. He lives in a crummy joint called Prattle's Motel. Here, here, I got the phone number. I'll show ya. Here, here, you keep it. He's a lousy crook anyway and I want nothing to do with him. If you're lying it won't be hard to find you. On my mother's grave, Mister. What dog pound's it in? Get out of here! [CHILDREN LAUGHING] [PHONE RINGING] Hello. JACK: Hello, is... Is this Miss Baker? Yes, it is. Is this Jack? No, I'm a friend of his. He got your message and wanted me to call ya and find out what you wanted. Oh. Well, it's, uh, very personal. I'll have to talk to him. Would you ask him to come to the phone, please? Um, sorry, lady, he won't do that. He wants to know how you got his number. He says he don't know who you are. Tell him I'll pay the same amount for the return of the notebook that I paid the man in the pawn shop for the other things. $100 cash, no questions asked. Dirty, lying... NAN: Is something wrong? [SCOFFS] No, no, lady. Nothing I can't take care of. $100, huh? Seems like a lot of money, just for a notebook. Well, it's very important really. If I don't get it back, I'll lose my job. This other number here, is that your office number? Yes. Okay, lady, I'll get back to you as soon as I can. A hundred bucks. [SCOFFS] Big fink! Ought to go down there and break his neck! [KNOCKING AT DOOR] Oh. Oh, there it goes again. I'm not gonna get these books done tonight, I know that. If it ain't the phone, it's the door. Oh. Oh! - Come in, Jacky boy. - Well, hello, Mrs. Prattle... Prattle! Yes, ma'am. Uh, what did they do with the trash that they took out of my room this morning? Look, you get no nothing out of me. Nothing, you understand, until you pay your rent. Why, I was going to pay you money, anyways, is... Yeah, well, I've heard that before. I happen to know you've got some money and I want the rent. You owe me nine dollars and 38 cents - and that's what I want. - All right. Yes, ma'am, here it is. - $10, you can keep the change. - [MUMBLING] Now tell me what you did with my trash, please. Well, the city truck came and picked it up. They always do on Wednesday. - Oh. - You've been here long enough to know that. Well, what'd they do with it? Well, they burn it. What do you think they do with trash? - They can't sell it, can they? - They burned it, huh. It's just my luck. Uh... Thanks a lot, Mrs. Prattle. Prattle! JACK: Yes, ma'am. [CHILDREN LAUGHING] Oh, why not, it might work. Let's see... I need paper, notebook... Yeah. [CHUCKLES] Anybody follow these plans, they're going to end up with a real doozy. That's perfect. She'll never know the difference. I'll be long gone with that $100 by the time she finds out. [SIGHS] Better make that call, Jackson. Wonder if I've got a dime. Yeah! You little money maker. [KNOCK AT DOOR] Come on in. Just close the door. Jack? That's right. I'm Nan Baker. Yes, ma'am. I... I think I'd recognize you about anywhere. Recognize me? Oh... yes, ma'am, I mean... From hearing your voice on the telephone. Did you bring the money? May I see the notebook? Ah! No, no, no, you don't. Well, I just wanted to make sure. You satisfied? It looks like it. Well, it is it. You shouldn't go around calling people a liar. I'm sorry. [JACK SCOFFS] I have the money here in my purse. That boss of yours sure is a lucky guy. What do you mean? Having you around all the time. Aren't you going to count it? Oh, well, no. I guess if you can trust me I can trust you. I want to thank you, Jack. What's the matter with you? I, I steal that stuff from you and then I make you pay to get it back. You go thanking me like it was a big deal or something. You don't go thanking a crumb, lady. That's about all I am, is a crumb. All I know is that we made a bargain - and you kept your end of it. - [SCOFFS] I, I think you better get out of here. Thanks again. Go on, get out of here! Bye. Look, Alan, I've got it! But, what are you doing here? You didn't think I'd let you meet that thief without being somewhere close, did you? Oh, I'm so glad it's over. So am I. You and I are going to take a day off tomorrow. Right now, I'm going to get these back to my client. All right, but call me later. That's a promise. [ENGINE STARTING] I told you, I'd get it back. I must confess, I had my doubts. What's the matter? You fool! You stupid, insipid fool! Now just a minute, Taylor, I don't take that from anyone. Look at it! Well, what's wrong? Except for the first few pages, this is all gibberish! Well, don't blame me. Blame the man in New Mexico! Can't you get it through your head? Somebody switched pages! The way that book is now, it's worthless. Why would a two-bit thief do a thing like that? You're a dead man unless we find out. That cheap little punk and the pawn broker. They must have cooked this up between them. Wait a minute. Maybe... Maybe those pages are useless to them except to get more money. When I get my hands on them, I'll break their greedy little necks. No, Alan. From here on, Leo and I will deal with these people. [GROANS] What are you guys beating on me for? I never done nothing to you. Oh, but you have, young man. Yeah, you have broken faith. Allowed greed to out-balance prudence. [GROANING] Leo? Revive him. That's enough. [JACK GROANING] All right, young man, now are you ready to discuss matters, huh? Yeah. [GASPS] Anything you say, but... Don't let that guy... Don't let him hit me anymore. Excellent. Now, if you'd just give us those papers you removed from that notebook, we'll be on our way. You better talk now, son, or you won't be able to. - Oh, the papers, please. - Listen, uh... I don't... Have any papers. I gave them all to the girl. [GRUNTING] No! Listen now... I told you guys... I told you the truth. Now I don't know a thing about them, honest. Then who does? Listen... You don't think I'd have them on me, would you? I gave them to somebody to keep for me. Who? The pawn broker? - Yeah. - You sure? I... I'm not going to... Get myself killed just to keep that guy from getting beat up. I see... Honor among thieves, huh? Empty your pockets! What? - Leo. - No, wait, wait. Wait a minute. Take it! Wait, wait. That's my money. Now you hear me, little man. If you're telling me the truth, you might get a portion of this back. If not... [CHUCKLES] You won't have any need for money. What time does your friend close? About 5:00. Good. Leo'll keep a friendly eye on you until I get back. Don't look so worried. [DOOR CLOSES] Boy! [GASPS] You sure got a hard set of hands. [GROANS] It's going to be some mouse I got here. Hey, uh... Hey, how about my going to the office and picking myself some ice? Sure, friend. I don't see anything wrong in that. Hey, thanks. [STOOL CLATTERING] - I'll be back in a minute. - Yeah... I know you will cause I'm going with you. [SIGHS] Yeah, sure. [KNOCK ON DOOR] Mrs. Prattle. MAN: Prattle! Ma ain't here, she's shopping. Willie, I got to have a little ice. Wow! - What happened to you? - Never mind, never mind. Now how about some ice? Cost you a dime. Oh, brother. There you go. Help yourself. And make it quick. Yeah, yeah. I'll be right with you. Hey, who's he? He's a friend of mine. Ma don't allow no doubling up in the rooms unless you pay extra. Hey, Willie, where'd you get this? It was in the trash. It's mine now. You threw it away! I don't want the notebook, Willie. I just want to know what you did with the papers in it. They were all used up. I got rid of 'em. Well, where? Well, I used them to line the cat's box. - Come on, what's going on? - Ah, nothing, nothing. I'm just gonna put some water in this tray here. Ma don't allow anyone to come back here. Hey, let's have a look at those pages. Ah, no, there's nothing here, but some old addresses of mine. I was just trying to get them back from Willie. - Why, you! - Ah! - You can't... - Don't you move a muscle! Uh, Stinking cats! Ma ain't going to like this. You give your mom a message for me, Willie. Tell her I'm checking out of this stinking joint! Hey, what about him? I don't know. Charge him rent. Oh. [SCREAMING] Don't make me use it! You scream again, you're going to look a lot worse than I do. What do you want? Don't play that, "I don't know nothing" routine for me. Please, I gave you the money, what more do you want? Plenty! You tell that boyfriend of yours those papers are going to cost him a grand now. But I don't understand, Alan has the papers! Don't play games with me! You know that stuff I gave you was phony except for a few pages. I just thought I could skip out, before you and him got wise, but I was a little too slow, it seems. Please believe me, I, I don't know what you're talking about. I suppose you didn't know, your boyfriend and that big goon of his was going to work me over either. You're not talking sense, Jack. - Listen to me. - I listened to you once. Look what it got me. No, no. Now you tell that southern gentleman, he better have a thousand bucks ready for me by tomorrow, or else I'll just burn his precious papers. - NAN: All right, I'll tell him. - All right. And no funny business this time. I'll get in touch with you tomorrow. And tell him not to waste his time looking for me at that motel cause I'm not going to be there. Whatever you say. I thought you were something special. No wonder you consider me a dope. That's not true, Jack. I think I'll go out the front door this time for a change. I don't believe you'd be calling anybody to stop me either. Pete! Pete, are you here? [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Pete, I'm sorry. I didn't know they'd... If you hadn't finked out on me, this wouldn't have happened. You just charge this up against what you chiseled me out of. So long, Pete. It doesn't make sense, his coming back here, threatening me. I wish I'd have been here. Those papers I paid him for this afternoon, they were genuine? Well, of course. I checked them over myself before I turned them over to my client, why? Well, someone did beat him up. Oh, his face was bruised something awful. That serves him right. Alan! Well, how do you expect me to feel? He's just lucky I didn't get my hands on him. I can't help feeling that there's something wrong. You know what probably happened, one of his good friends found out he had the $100 and took it from him. Now he thinks he can scare you into getting more money for him. I still say we should notify the police. There's no telling what he may do. The first thing you're going to do is get back to bed! We both need some sleep. I'll take care of him in the morning. - Good night, honey. - Good night. This is a gun in my pocket. Just act like we was old friends. - What are you going to do? - Whatever I have to. Your boss gettin' the money for me? Jack, be sensible. Think before you get yourself into more trouble or hurt somebody. Look, I want to help you and so does Mr. Sheridan. Sure he does. He wants to help me just like he helped Pete. Look, I might as well tell you. Mr. Sheridan isn't going to pay any more money. You wanna bet? Why should he pay for something he's already turned over to his client? All right, you tell me why all the interest in these? Now, take a good look. Well, this proves it. Alan, Mr. Sheridan isn't an engineer, he's in business manage... You really play it to the hilt, don't you? Don't you think I know what's going on here? You and him are probably nothing but a pair of lousy spies selling out your own country. If you believe that why don't you go to the authorities - and report it? - What's that going to put in my pocket? No, we'll play this my way. And if there's no more funny business, I'll just forget about everything. I'll even forget about Pete. - The pawn broker? - Yeah. The dead pawn broker! Dead? Well, you just ask Sheridan what I'm talking about. - But why should he... - Listen, you know where Seward and Waring streets are? I think so. There's an old abandoned warehouse on the corner. And that's where I want you to bring the money. 3:00 sharp, you be there alone with the money. The door's going to be open for you and I'll be inside. If there's any more tricks, I'll just burn those papers, and we'll forget the whole thing. Go on, get going! Jack, if you really believe what you're saying, take that paper to the police. It'll prove to you that you're mistaken. I got a better idea. You take this page to Sheridan. Tell him to take it to the cops. Just see what he says. Take it! Now, go on, get going. Go on! Alan. Good morning, honey. - Over sleep? - Alan, look at this. What is it? Where'd you get this? Jack was down in the parking lot. What? He must be crazy. He even claimed you were involved in some sort of espionage. What else did he say? I'm supposed to take the money to an old warehouse on Seward and Waring. And he... He said that you'd be afraid to take that paper to the authorities. I don't know what this fellow's talking about, but he's sure wrong on that little guess. What are you going to do? What I should have done last night. Take this over to Lieutenant Krul's office. He'll end this quick enough. Oh, I'm so glad, Alan. He had me wondering. I won't feel safe until this is over. Oh... Look, Nan, I'll be back as soon as I can. I'm expecting a call from Wheeler, so you better stick by the phone. All right, Alan. NAN: Sheridan Enterprises. Tell your boss I want the money in small bills, 10s and 20s, you got it? Yes, I understand, small bills. Police Department. Sergeant Cooper speaking. Hello, can I have Lieutenant Krul's office, please? COOPER: Just a minute, please. KEITH: Lieutenant Keith speaking. May I speak to Mr. Sheridan? KEITH: There's no Mr. Sheridan here, lady. May I talk with the lieutenant then? KEITH: I'm sorry, Lieutenant Krul won't be here today. Are you sure? KEITH: Yes, I'm sure. Well, Mr. Sheridan was going over to Lieutenant Krul's office. KEITH: Miss, the lieutenant is still on his vacation. Oh, I see, vacation. KEITH: He'll be back next week. Next week? KEITH: Oh, sorry I couldn't be of any service to you, miss. All right, thank you, very much. KEITH: Is he seeing someone else? No, I don't know who else he might be seeing. - KEITH: If he comes in, I'll tell him someone called. - Thank you. - Bye. - KEITH: Goodbye. [DOOR OPENING] Sorry, we took so long. Ms. Baker, this is Detective Sergeant Davis. How do you do, Ma'am? - Hello. - It's nothing to worry about, Ma'am. Nan, uh, from what I can gather, it's not just a matter of the police going out to the warehouse and arresting Jack. We need proof that he's actually attempting to extort money from Mr. Sheridan. Well, isn't our word and what's happened enough? Not if they're going to prosecute him. We realize it's a lot to ask, Ma'am, but we'd like you to go through with the delivery of the money. You'll have complete police protection every minute. And once the exchange is made, he's ours. It's the only way, Nan. We've got to get this thing over with, once and for all. He's dangerous. All right, Alan, if you think I should. Good. Our men are staking the warehouse out right now. You'd be surprised, Ms. Baker, how few citizens are really willing to help the police, if it means a little inconvenience. How will you handle Jack? Well, that depends on him, ma'am. He can have it anyway he wants it. Better get your things. If I didn't know you better, I'd believe you were a cop. I was once, but they didn't like the way I handled some of the punks I brought in. I can believe that. Alan. While you were gone, Jack phoned. He did? What'd he want? He wants the money in small bills. He'll get it, and it won't be in small bills. [HORN HONKING] Oh, here comes the skipper. Skipper? Lieutenant Krul, he's in charge of this operation. - Sergeant. - Lieutenant. Mr. Sheridan. Oh, Ms. Baker. Has everything been explained to you clearly? Do you have any questions? I don't think so. Good. You have the department's gratitude, Ma'am. When did you get back, Lieutenant? I tried to get you earlier at your office. Oh. [LAUGHS] Oh, well, you see I came directly here from the house. Uh, we better be going, Lieutenant. You take the wheel, Sergeant. Now there's nothing to worry about, young lady. In an hour you'll be back here, and this will all be part of the past. I hope so. Time is getting short, Ms. Baker. It's 3:00. Well, here it is. All I want you to do, Miss, is go inside, give him this money, pick up those papers and come right back here. Do you want me to do this? We don't have much choice, Nan. Now, after you effect the transfer and you're safely back out here, we'll hit from all sides. Be careful, Nan. I don't like it, Taylor. That dame's got something on her mind. Who would've expected her to call the police department? She's just nervous. Who wouldn't be? We'll worry about her nerves after we get ahold of those papers. - All right, Leo, I'll take the front. - Right. Stay here. I don't want you to get in the way. Jack. Jack, where are you? I... I have the money for you. Jack. Jack, where are you? Jack. Jack, I've got the money. [GASPS] [GASPING] All right, here's your papers. - I'll be seeing ya. - Jack, don't go out there! - What are you talking about? - Listen to me. You were right about everything. TAYLOR: All right, this is the police! We've got you surrounded. Don't move in on him, men, until I give you the word. Giving you a chance to come out alive. You dirty little double crosser! One sound out of you and you're going to get it first! Do you hear me? Come out with your hands up! Jack, listen, it's not the police! Look, there are three of them out there. You were right about them. They made me do it. Oh, please believe me. Where are they? I don't know. You know something? I think I do believe you. That means they're going to want you as bad as they want me. Get up on that catwalk. You got to be able to see them from there. Now, get going. Stick real close to me, huh? [SCREAMING] Nan... Nan, are you all right? Jack, it's, it's Alan. Nan! Nan! Nan, get out here! That's one we won't have to fight our way through anyway. There's a skylight up on the roof. You go up those stairs and you stay there. I'm going to try to lead 'em round the other side of the building. Take these with you. I'm not going to let them have 'em. Go on, now get going. Go on. Go on. Go on. I know your gun's empty! Now, I don't want to have to kill you. All I want are those papers. Just throw them down and I'll leave. All right. Then I'll come up after you. Oh, Jack, I can't get the skylight open. [SIGHS] I'm too weak to get up those stairs now, anyway. Listen... Go on over there. Find yourself a dark place to hide. - And take those papers with ya. - Look... I don't want those guys to get them back now. Maybe if I helped you up the stairs we could both get it open. - No. - Let's try. Now listen to me. You go on over there and give me a chance to do something good in my life. Just for once. No. Now go on over there or I'm going to use this thing on ya. Go on! [PANTING] She thinks I'm a hero. Feels kinda nice. [PANTING] If I hadn't got shot, I wonder if I'd have stuck around. [SCREAMING] Jack! [SOFT MUSIC PLAYING]
