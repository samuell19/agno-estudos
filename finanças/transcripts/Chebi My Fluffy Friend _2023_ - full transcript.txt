What's this? Gotcha! Miguel, Eeyore showed up again. -What? -Don't move. -Juan, what are you doing? -Don't move. You and I are headed to the top of the arboretum to take a look at the Red Fingerwort. Known as Dactylariza moculorum. Grandpa! Pull to the right, Grandpa! Stop! Stop! Boy! You can't do that! -What? -It's Anthropophagus! -Well... -Palm ogre. Ugh. what's that baby gonna do to me? Well. she's not gonna do anything to you. Her mom, on the other hand. You got it? Tell the rest of the class. Run! Did you remember to grunt? - What? You're being a pig. Well, you're a janitor. You'll clean it up. What are you doing? You old asshole! Have a nice day. Keep your eyes open-- he's dangerous. You're the one who's dangerous. Juan, get down quickly. You're dead! Miguel, give me the pitchfork. Pitchfork, pitchfork. We are very reverent about our guests, especially honored ones like you. Did you think you were gonna get away with this? I assure you, I won't. Turn around. Turn around now. Do you know who's talking to you? No, I don't. Boor! Fire him! Immediately. How about a stern reprimand first? Very strict? He won't get his annual bonus. Do we have an annual bonus? Petrovich, where are you walking, come here, or we won't be able to finish the game again. You're the one with the loyal boss. I'm just about to run out of lunch. Yeah, that's it, huh? Petrovich, did you hear that today there's some kind of scary cyclone... ...promise. You can hear my knees buzzing. Come here. We're not gonna make it in time again. We'll make it. Mate! Here's another interesting fact. It's gonna rain. My knees have never let me down. My knees will carry you home. So long. Aren't you going to give me a ride? You're not sugar, Valera. You won't melt. What if what? What if what? What if there's a hailstorm? Yeah, like a chicken egg! Or out with an orange. Tanya! That's the one! And here's another interesting fact... A tornado can carry objects hundreds of miles. It rained fish in Minnesota in 2006. Can you believe it? Ha ha ha. Whoa. Uh-oh! Uh-oh! Is it good? Yes. Bloody oranges! I just cleaned the window this morning. Couldn't have broken them yesterday. Tolya, you didn't forget that Grisha has drawing in 10 minutes? Of course, did not forget. Can I help you? No. How do you make such delicious chocolate? The secret. But I'll open it up for you. It's all about my magic recipe book. Can I see it? No, no. Otherwise, you'll learn the secret formula for chocolate. You open your own stores, you'll stop coming to me altogether. What's up? See you at the chocolate festival. Thank you. Goodbye. - Can I ask you something indiscreet? - Uh, yeah. How much is all this stuff worth? All the merchandise? Your whole store. Petrovich? What are you doing? Nothing. Wow, Grisha! Grandson! Hey, baby! How are you? А? Silent? Like a fish. The doctors say we have to wait. How long do I have to wait? Come on, let's get out of here. If Tanya sees you, we'll both be in trouble. You know that. She's pissed off about those competitors today. We also had a citrus window broken. So let me help you with that. I'll glaze it. I'll take care of the glass. That's it. Oh, Tanya! We're going to art, too. We met by chance. And all that. Tanya! And Tanya! When are you going to make up? And I'm to spend my whole life between hammer and anvil? Petrovich, you know, come and visit us tomorrow. Maybe at Grisha's birthday party you can talk? Yeah, sure, sure. - Well, how old will you be tomorrow? - Five? It's an anniversary. What can I get you? What can I get you? Not oranges. Got it? Yes? Come on, let's go. I don't want to get a message from Tanya. Okay, bye. Run, run, run, run, run, run. You bastard! Wait, wait, where? Which way, I said! Stop! Stop! Where I said! What are you? - Gennady Petrovich! What? What am I supposed to do with you? А? And do what? Why? And you live alone like a finger. So you're angry at the world. You know, if you don't change the way you treat people around you, we're gonna have to say goodbye. I got a puppy. So not a ring, not one, as you say. - What breed is that? - Sheepdog. - A sheepdog? - Yeah, a Belarusian big-eared. Belarusian? No, no. It's a very restless breed and very feisty. And by the way, you know, like in the garden. chasing moles and mice? That's not why I'm here at all. Do you even know who you insulted today? That woman could shut down the entire Arboretum. That's it. A clever breed of Belarusian. Stop clowning around. I'll make it up to you. How many times have I heard that? So I'm fostering. I guess things are gonna get better now, huh? I sure hope so. Listen! - Do you want some vitamins? - I can't get enough of them. I can't fit either. I'll be orange in no time. Baba. look at the little ears. Hey! I didn't say you could run away! To the leg! Bub! What are you doing here? Get lost? Tell you what, buddy. Good morning! About the incident yesterday. I'm not taking offense. Gena. You see, they want to buy your puppy. Yes, we'd like to buy. О! Oh, my God! What is that? It's a puppy. Belarusian long-eared sheepdog. Vaccinated. Yes. That's what he smells like. Or are you? It's not for sale! I want Eeyore! Why did you vandalize the place? А? What are you doing? Ouch! That's it! Right? That's it! Right? Uh-huh? Uh-huh! Uh-huh? Uh-huh! Don't do that. It's clear. The tail is small, the claws are medium-sized, and the ears are huge. That's it. Yeah, the expertise is top-notch. Come on. Looks like a hybrid. It's not a hybrid, where do you get those words? An exotic specimen. You know, it'll draw people to the zoo and increase interest. You'll have to decide whether to take it or not. - It's still cheap. - I'd like that. What if there's some kind of commission, some kind of inspection? You don't know what kind of animal it is. They'll think we're doing experiments on animals. Animal crossbreeding. Uh-uh. Then checkmate. Again! Did you bring him here on purpose to distract me? Yes? Why would I distract you? You're doing just fine on your own. See, how... Hey, hey, Petrovich! Aren't you forgetting something? That's it. Go! Not me. Go on, get out! You're, uh. you're a nobody, and I don't need you. Go look for your own. Move! Walk! So, how's it going? The hen is decorating the nest. What? What chicken? Come. Grisha. Oh, this is really good. Go ahead. Grisha! Let me feed you. Here. You get the potatoes. Tanya, it's, uh. what's-his-name, birthday. And he's like a grandfather. And he's like a grandson. Did you sort of call him? I kind of wasn't asked. Tanya, do you like chocolate? Uh-huh. You're my sweetie. - You know what kind of ice cream I like? - What kind? With meat. Luba, go get the cutlets. We're going to eat them with ice cream now. Tanya? Tanya, why don't we talk? What should we talk about? Have you eaten? Here, take your present. Happy birthday. Well, I guess I should go. Thank you for a lovely family dinner. Tatiana. Hello again. I told you the store is not for sale. We misunderstood. It's not about buying, it's about joining. And he doesn't want to be a member of the family's successful business. I already have my own. Yeah, she has her own. You know what our CEO likes to say? Small businesses are always stormy. That's why we're big. Look, I'm not interested in, uh. You don't understand. All these inspections, rent's going up. It goes like this. Some powerful competitor will open a giant supermarket of sweets right across the street. And if you ever stick your nose in this apartment again, your big business is going to be in for a big storm. Tell that to your CEO. That's my father-in-law! А? Why don't we sit down again? And all that. А? Mom! Mom! He's talking! Did you say that? Yes, Mom, look. Grisha! Grisha! Grisha, you spoke. So. And this is our who? Really Petrovich, and what kind of animal? Monkey or dog? It's a puppy. It's mine. He must have gotten in through the window. What kind of breed is that? A sheepdog. Belarusian, good breed, kind. Good with kids. Mom, he's good. Yes... He's a good dog. Peeling oranges. Well, if you like it, feel free to come and play. - Mom, may I? - We'll think about it. What is there to think about? Grisha five years of silence. And here it is, some therapeutic beast. Look, son. It's what's-his-name. Say, Dad. That's it. That'll do! Mom, look. Mom?! - Look, it's an orange. Well? - An orange. - Well! - Did you see it? -You saw it. - Have you seen it? Well, what kind of creature is this? А? Maybe he's the result of some kind of experimentation? Abyrwalg. Abyrwalg. Here's an interesting fact. Many animals can imitate human speech. It's called parroting, monkeying around. Yes? Open your eyes. What are you saying, it's a cross between a parrot and a monkey? Porronki. Mom, I'm an porronki? See, that's logical thinking. Yes? Yes. Do animals do that? Not every man can do that. Well, why don't you teach him how to read? Yeah. I don't have anything else to do. - Well, let's go first. - А. - Keep going. - Bae. Next letter. It's V. It's sha. It's not sha, it's sha. What's this? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Keep going. Mom. Washing the frame. - Mom! Good job. Take a vacation. Tanya! Hi! I'm that thing, you know. Oh, I got it from Tolik. Can you imagine, I taught this to a puppy here. A second. Daliah's Dictionary. It's not Dalia, it's Dalia. But you're not ready for that yet. There's nothing. I thought, maybe you would you come by tomorrow? Uh, okay. I was tactful, polite, courteous, as you taught me. But, uh. Did you tell my small business joke? Of course you did. Threatening convincingly or mumbling as usual? I was as dangerous as possible. But they clearly hinted that they weren't ready. A girl's cry of "I want an Eeyore!" Sonya, Grandma will buy you everything. And we'll wash your ears. And we'll wash his hair, too. And we'll make a handsome boy like this. Uh-oh. Now close your eyes. Oh! Mom, it's cold now. Now, now we'll make it warmer. Here, it's warm. О! It's warm. Look. This is Grisha, my grandson and your friend. When a friend comes over, you say, "Hi!" And when a friend leaves, you say, "Bye." You got it? Uh-huh. And what do you say when Grisha comes? Hi, Grisha! Well done! And hello, orange. Bye, orange. Ow! What? We gotta pee-pee. fast. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, you can't pee-pee in a flower. You pee-pee in the pot. Hi, Grisha! I'm busy! Gennady Petrovich, it's the last chance to sell the puppy. She's offering 40,000. I beg you, Gennady Petrovich. I promise an annual bonus. Okay. A million! Are you crazy? Gene, that's not funny. Good day. Pot? What a pot! It's my cup! Be patient! Pee later. Come on. Be quiet. I'm ready...(Million). Where's the sheepdog? The puppy got away. I can't find it this morning. Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi! Where did he go? I don't know. Maybe he smelled a mole. I told you. Well, if he shows up, I'll let you know. He'll show up, he'll show up. We'll call you right away. Don't worry, don't worry so much. He won't show up. It's not a big deal. We'll make some calls. Let's find our arboretum the new leadership. And this one, I hope, will be able to deal with his subordinates by now. Come on, Sonechka. Killing you is not enough. Gena? What? It's warm. Hawaii. Gavrik. That's the way it goes. Ga-ga-ga-gla! Hello, Grisha! Where's Tanya? She's, uh, what's-her-name, getting ready for the festival. Hello, Grisha! Come in. Come on in. Wow! When did he learn to talk? Sonia, I have a surprise for you. Did you get an Eeyore? No. Better. - You're bad! - That's it. I want my mom and dad. Kuro-po-la. - Huhrik. - Next. What a hoochie. Keep going. Keep going. Tsa-Tsatsa. - Ouch! It's tsaburah! - What? Fell, slipped or crashed. Thank you, Petrovich. Is that your monkey? I'm Popuzyana. Or hoochie. Mom. Who am I? Huh? Look, uh. erectness, hair. He's also talking. Maybe he's Bigfoot. А? Listen to me, you upright man. Stop talking. Go on. I don't know where. Well, did you see that?! Bigfoot checkmated you. And checkmate. Yes... My first win. Well, ours, ours. Straight walker! Wow, that's what I wanted, too, by the way. Uh-huh. Hi. Hey, hey! Last year at the Chocolate Festival, we got an embarrassing second place for the first time. And we've been passed over by some cheesy chocolate shop. Have you tried their products? Is it good? You're lying! Hypocrites. It's really good. Just as delicious should be our Joy of Mine chocolate. Did you repeat the formula? We've broken down the damn competitor's chocolate literally into molecules. You are about to witness the magic of science. Pardon the oxymoron. Is this what joy looks like to you? Eat it. The idea is that our signature chocolate train will be shuttling around the square all day. In this way, we will, as it were, ring the joy of all present. You think this is a radio-controlled modeling contest? No, it's the annual chocolate festival. Eat it. I can't believe you guys don't get it. In order to surprise everyone, you have to do something like this amazing! Like this orange rain. You and I are going to make fireworks from our candy. - Fireworks! - Genius! Thank you. Well, it's all set up here. Tanya, don't worry. Your chocolate tastes 1000 times better. I saw you beat them last year. You were what? Daughter, even if you can't see me, I'm always here for you. What, are you spying on me? I am. Thank you. Who is this guy? I don't know. Who are you? Я? Galya. Yeah, Galya. Good boy, take it back. Ouch! Mommy, I'm a mess. Come on, come on, come on, stay out of the way. Got it. Got it, I'm outta here. Ow, ow! Come on. Oops! Luba, give us a star. Oh, good for you! That's the one. Where's Eeyore? Let's pass. Come on. О! No. Hi! Oh, look-- a talking monkey. I'm not a monkey. Who? I don't know. A raccoon? A dog? So you'll be a dog. You lied to me. Daddy said palm trees don't eat people. Yes? They're just waiting for the right opportunity. Do you realize who you just hurt? Do you know what this creature can turn into if you make it really angry? Into what? Too late! Is it warm now? Ah-ha, ha! Well, now you realize you have to treat him like a human being? I'm sorry. Humanly, is that like with a person? Or maybe I am a human being? Maybe someone who knows you? What were you looking at? Well, we did. I'm a human being, I'm a human being, I'm a human being.... - You're human, you say? - Uh-huh. Then learn to work. What's this: Knock, knock, knock. Where are the nails? Human being. Good afternoon, Tatiana. Good afternoon. Hello. What are you doing here? Bring more crates. And this is my father. I was just about to buy a puppy from him. What's your business? I want to buy everything in this family. By the way, have you found him yet? No. I hope you're not lying to me. Everybody's lying. It's all lies. Did you want something? Yeah. Good luck with the contest. Thank you. You too. -Destroy? -Yes. Why would she want him? You rat! Okay, that's the thing. What's that? Don't panic! Look A!!! Aah! Help! Aah! Tanya, they're not gonna close us down. I'm just gonna make a deal with him now and everything. Listen, Petrovich. Can you make a deal with him? I'm at a loss for words in these situations. Good afternoon. That's a beautiful shape you have. Here's an interesting fact. They say rats are some of the cleanest animals in the world. I have a friend who works at a zoo. Those aren't our rats either. They've already scattered. We'll get a cat. Even two. Can't we just turn a blind eye to all of this? You're closing for the month? Tanya, Tanya! The guy was a little uncooperative. It's okay. We're gonna win the chocolate contest. We'll celebrate, and then the month will fly by. I don't want to enter any contest. Tanya, you this very, uh. what? We've been doing all this preparation and everything. Tanya, did you hide your book somewhere? Yes? That's great. Someone needed her, too. A woman. With a hat. That's it! We can't handle her. We have to get out of here. Tanya, all right, all right, please calm down. I'm begging you. What do we do? We inhale, exhale, and smile. I can't smile anymore. Do I have such a fun life? Tanya, all my life I thought that I was strong, that I would achieve everything on my own, that I would cope with everything. No, you realize I don't have the strength to smile anymore. What, you think this is some kind of sweet life? Let's go to Moscow. Nobody smiles there. But they live well. -Tanya, what do you say? -No. No, you don't have to go anywhere. Mistress! What's her name? I don't know. A woman! Why are you yelling? My granddaughter's asleep. You leave my family alone. Then we won't yell. We will. - Alya! La la la la! - And I want my recipe book back! Quiet! Wait a minute! And bring back the recipe book! Get out of here before my guys throw your bucket of bolts in the trash with you. Why are you being rude? Do you know who you're talking to? This, by the way, is a naval officer, Rear Admiral Valery Zavgorodny. Yes, I have some of it. You don't. Clowns. I bought a giraffe from your admiral. So? I'm retired. I do what I want. Give me the book back! -Yeah. All right. (chuckles) I'll trade your long-eared puppy, or what's-his-name, bear, for your quiet life. Bring him to me tomorrow and I'll leave you alone. Screw her. All right. Let's go! Daddy, do you know who I love most in the world? I know. Mom's pancakes. No! You and Mom. Mom! Inspired by your brilliant idea of showering the entire city with "Joy of Mine" candy with fireworks, we made a firework with which we will shower the city with "Joy of Mine" candy. Run it. Genius! I like it. What kind of slurry is that? It's our chocolate. Well, it's delicious. I told you to make an exact replica of that upstart's chocolate. It doesn't matter. The upstart withdrew from the contest. Good for you. There I am not, where your footprints are not on the sand, Where the white bird in longing ... Where the bird is white in longing. Circling by the frothy water. I'm only there, Where the sound trembles at the lips of the coveted wharf. And where your eyes are swift. And where your eyes swift, gliding, Gliding across the sky intently. I'm not there, Where the smoke of hair will not blot out the White Day Where the pines are of amber tears, Where the pine trees of amber tears - wiped away by a caring deer. I'm only there, where you sometimes look at the door with hope, and like a kid with kids, and like a child with children, you're making a snow globe. I'm not there, Where the steamship in the night has gone bump in the night, Where the sky understands, Where the sky understands that without you I'm orphaned. I'm only where I'm not - around you invisible. You know I can't go a day without you, You know I can't go a day without you, You know I can't go a day without you. Tanya, I made a deal, they'll leave you alone. What deal? It doesn't matter. It's a deal. Didn't you take the tent down? Wow! I have to take the tent down. No, we don't. You'll be in the contest. Where's Eeyore? I had to give it away. Я... thought it was for the best. Better? Or easier? I just believed you'd changed. You know, you're best at betraying those who love you. I don't know how to please that monkey. It's a truffle. He came straight from Piemonte. Oh gods, why have you punished me? What do you want? - An orange. - An orange? Does Eeyore talk? Sure, like all your toys. What other words do you know? Tell me. Hopelessness. Hello, Petrovich! That's great. Here's another interesting fact. Crocodiles who lose their cubs lock themselves up at home and feel sorry for themselves. What are you talking about? Have you seen yourself in the mirror? You're a real alligator, scary and angry and ready to eat everybody. And now what? You just sit down and put your feet up, huh? Get your ass up. Follow me! What's the use of raising it? What can two old men do? First of all, who says we're old? And second of all, what makes you think there's two of us? - Wo! And you're here. - I've been working at this arboretum for 20 years. She's gonna fire me. Who the hell is she? That's right, as they say: one for all and all for one. Just like The Three Musketeers. Yeah. Well, two musketeers and three musketeers. That's five musketeers. Okay. But here's the question. How do we get to her? Go ahead. I hope you recognize me. - Uh, no. - I'm the director of the arboretum. I have a delivery for your mistress. We weren't warned. Because you don't talk about such things, like the giraffe and the panda who live here illegally. What do you have there? The rarest plant in the Red Book. What kind of plant? Cacoustroyanus. Flower. With an incredibly powerful root system. Cost 1,000,000. You have to plant today. You want it to wilt? Gennady, go ahead. And you're going to sign all these invoices now. I thought I couldn't take it. Where's Natalya Nikolayevna? She stayed behind to hold off the guards. Detain? Just like the Musketeers. All right, let's go. Let's go. Hello. May I? - And who are you? - Volunteers. How did you get here? It's how we got here. Э! Get out of my way, you bastard! What did you call me? We're musketeers. Now... I'll take care of it myself. I mean, what have I trained for all these years? I apologize, I apologize, come on, keep up. Come on in, it's okay. More. More. Yes? It's only been two floors, for crying out loud. I'm not tired. I just need a place to think about what I'm gonna do next. So many floors, so many doors. How are we gonna find him in a maze like this? Well, I don't know, we'll check it out. It's a very strange layout here. Sonia, hurry up! Come on! Stop! Everybody stop! Like the Musketeers, huh? Э! Let's go one at a time over there. Hey, man, nobody's gonna fight you. We called the police. That's enough of that. Give me that! Mom, why do they have my friend? You see, Grisha, he does not belong to anyone, so he can live wherever he wants. That's what it's called, Tanya. - Let me do it. - Please. Grigory, listen to me. The thing is, your grandfather, to save our store and all of us, he gave our hoochie to this one. to a bad woman. You got it? Now I'll take care of everything. Grisha! Tanya, where's Eeyore? There you are! What are you doing? I'm going to set you free. You're not a dog to be tied up. It's not human. And I don't want to be human. Humans are evil. I'd rather be just a toy. I'm sorry, there's no excuse for bad behavior. But, uh. there are reasons. All right, guys, let's hurry up. Luba, listen, I've got a strange feeling about this. Maybe you won't fly today. Gena, I've been practicing for two years. And what are you suggesting from your weird premonitions to skip everything? I wish the weather would turn bad. Boo-boo-boo-boo-boo. Don't grumble, it doesn't suit you. Okay? Come on, everybody. It's windy. - Of course it is, Gene, we're in the mountains. - Why don't we go to the arboretum? А? Let's get some ice cream. Now, I'm just going to win the competition. And go. Eh! Is it normal for it to go down so fast? Not really. Daddy, are you okay? I blamed everyone and everything: this stupid competition, and the weather. Even Luba. Pissed off at the world. You'd better stay at Aunt Masha's for a while. 10 years of wandering around, trying to forget everything. And when I got back, I realized I'd lost everything. I lost my daughter, too. She couldn't take me back. How hard it is to be human. You know, Gena, I think you're so sad, because you don't know how to forgive. Not yourself, or anyone else. I didn't realize it for 30 years. What's up? - You had a good time? - Well, we did. I welcome you to our beautiful celebration. Today our factory is pleased to present our products. Daughter! Now the whole family's here. And Grisha where? Petrovich, have you seen Grisha? I hope you enjoy it. He's on a rocket! That's right, Tanya. Stop! There's a baby in the rocket! Tanya, this very thing. Tanya! They're coming down so fast. I'd say they're even falling. That's the thing. heavy. Grab it! What are you looking at? I was about to flip! Well, dear friends, this is what happened yesterday, what people commonly call a second birthday. The truth is, we don't know when you were born. Therefore. may your first birthday will be today. -Right. It's the right thing to do. My dear friend, I wish you always stay as kind as you are. and a wonderful man. Happy birthday. Happy Birthday!!! I am not a man. I am myself, I am... I'm Cheburashka. Happy birthday, Cheburashka! Happy birthday, Cheburashka. And happy birthday to me. Happy birthday! Happy Birthday! Yay. Hello. Hello! I'm sorry, I was up all night. I understand you. and imagining my granddaughter being in a rocket. Well, all's well that ends well. And you bring your granddaughter, let her play with Cheburashka too. Sonechka's been taken from me. My next two weeks with her aren't until a year later. It's all my fault. I should have taken care of my son, not my business. Now he won't even see me. Calm down, calm down. Everything's gonna be all right. Would you like some cake? Let the pedestrians run clumsily through the puddles and the water rivers across the asphalt. And it's not clear to passersby, on this bad-weather day. Why I'm so cheerful. And I play the harmonica In full view of passersby. Unfortunately. a birthday Only once a year. Suddenly a wizard in a blue helicopter will come and show a movie for free. He'll wish me a happy birthday and probably leave me 500 popsicles. And I play the harmonica in full view of passersby. Unfortunately, a birthday only once a year. Unfortunately, it's my birthday, only once a year. "Esta sacavado" is Spanish for "You're finished. " He knows Spanish, right? I play the harmonica. In full view of passersby. Unfortunately, the day of my birthday Only once a year. Unfortunately, a birthday is only once a year. I play the harmonica in front of passersby. Unfortunately, a birthday is only once a year. Unfortunately, a birthday is only once a year. Good afternoon! What happened? Traffic violation. Remove this one from the steering wheel. Я... CHEBURASHKA. The sun on the asphalt, bunnies glide, I walk leisurely. My heart beats faster, bursting with happiness like a balloon. Heads down, a plume of clouds above us, sailing fast, fast, fast. Life, it's a fight, just don't cry. All this slush, nothing, nothing. The sun on the pavement, bunnies gliding, I'm taking my time. My heart beats faster, bursting with happiness, It's like a balloon. And in the reflections floated my movements, And the continuation of the street, the street. Let the south wind blow the clouds on the cushions, Everything I need, I already have. The sun on the pavement, bunnies sliding, I walk slowly. My heart beats faster, bursting with happiness, It's like a balloon. The sun on the pavement, bunnies gliding, I'm taking my time. My heart beats faster, bursting with happiness. It's like a hot air balloon ...
