I'd look up on the stage and the people always looked so happy to be there. I thought to myself that's what I wanted to do and where I wanted to be. When they'd come near the foot of the stage and look out I was sure they were looking right at me right at little Gilda Radner. Now that I'm up here, I can't see a thing.

I'm-a sorry from the bottom of my heart to have to inform you that your scheduled speaker for tonight Cardinal Dario Fungi.. [laughter] ...is unable to speak with you tonight because of jet lag. As you know, he is the oldest living cardinal one hundred and six years old. That's-a getting up there and traveling does have a toll on him. And-a tonight, just about a half hour ago I could see he was-a real hyper.. [laughter] ...so I gave him, like, 1/4 of a Quaalude. [laughter] It was just a little chip. It was just-a nothing, a little.. But he's enjoying himself now. I am Father Guido Sarducci. I work for.. [applause] Thank you. Thank you. I work for L'osservatore Romano. That's the official Vatican newspaper. I do a little gossip column for them. When I'm not busy working on my column I accompany the wonderful cardinal on the college lecture circuit in Italy. You know most cardinal types they're just too darn stuck-up to want to go on the road but the Fungi, he's a real sport about it. And since he's a Roman Catholic cardinal he can demand top money on the college lecture circuit. I just help him out and sub for him when he's not feeling quite up to par. What he does is, he talks about America, what's going on here. He makes, like, social political, economic observations. He makes some predictions for the future that kind of stuff. I hope you're going to enjoy his speech as much as they did last month at the University of Bologna. It was-a terrific in Bologna. It went just great. Scusi. Come on. Slide time. Come on. Come on.

[laughter and applause] In 1963, Lenny Ripp, an independent record promoter 'called me on a new unknown singing act' 'that he had caught performing' at a high school hop in Great Neck, Long Island. On Lenny's recommendation I called teenager Rhonda Weiss and her group into my office heard their sound, and immediately signed them to an exclusive long-term recording contract. A string of successful chat records followed and Rhonda and the Rhondettes were skyrocketed to the forefront of a musical genre whose heart-wrenching style of teenage lament caused it to become known as schmaltz rock. The hits kept coming until 1966 when the rise of British rock 'n' roll forced the girls to leave the recording industry 'for the lucrative lounges of Las Vegas, Tahoe' and Reno, Nevada. Today, thanks to the efforts of Mindy Eisenstein Frankie Garris, and their fabulous staff at the LCBO Talent Agency to their manager Maury Daniels 'Rhonda and the Rhondettes are back' 'with a new release, a new sound' and a new message. So now, ladies and gentlemen please join me in welcoming the dynamic Rhonda Weiss and the Rhondettes! [instrumental music] [music stops] [cheering and applause] Hi, I'm Rhonda Weiss. I, uh, I want to thank Don Kirshner for introducing us and also for teaching me that rock 'n' roll can be a means of creative expression. Tonight I would like to sing a song with a very socially relevant message and I know I speak not only for myself but for my closest personal friends in the entire world the Rhondettes. Um, up until now I never really felt the need to protest. I mean, nothing in the 60s really bothered me. None of the guys I knew went to Vietnam. They all went to law school. And, um, actually I've always found protest kind of pushy and whiny until recently. I read in theNational Enquirer.. ...that the food and drug administration was considering banning saccharin from the market. I nearly died. I make the most fantabulous diet dessert mocha frost dream. It's only 29 calories a serving. I swear on my life. Okay, should the FDA ban saccharin an equivalent size portion of that same dessert mocha frost dream would then be, listen to this.. ...810 calories. People, we cannot let this happen in America. I mean, I'm sorry about the lab animals but statistics prove that most guys prefer skinny girls with cancer over healthy girls with bulging thighs. And here's what you've all been waiting for..

I like-a that one about the saccharin. I like-a the one, too, about the little girl. Little-little brownie girl. That was a good one. You know, it's amazing this-a place really reminds me of a school that the Vatican sent me to. A place-a called the Marconi School of Broadcasting. I went to the Reggio Calabria Branch. That's-a the best branch. And we had a gym just-a like this one. We had to take gym. Also, I went to the seminary, Gregorian Seminary in Rome but I never like-a school too much to tell you the truth. I find education, it don't matter where you go to school Italy, America, Brazil, all the same. It's all-a just memorization. It don't matter how long you can remember anything just so you can parrot it back for the test. And I got-a this idea for a school I would like to start something called the five-minute university. And the idea is that in five minutes you learn what the average college graduate remembers five years after he or she's out of school. Would cost like-a $20. That might seem like a lot of money $20 just for 5 minutes but that's for like tuition, cap and gown rental.. ...graduation picture.. ...snacks, everything. Everything included. You know, like in college you have to take foreign language. Well, at the five-minute university you can have your choice any language you want you can take it. Say if you want to take Spanish what I teach you is como esta usted? That means how are you? The answer is muy bien. That means very well. Believe me, if you took two years of college Spanish five years after you're out of school como esta usted? Muy bien is about all you're going to remember. [applause] So in my school, that's all you learn. You see, you don't have to waste your time with conjugations, vocabulary, all that junk. You just forget it anyway. What's the difference? Economics? Supply and demand. [laughter] That's it. Business-business is you buy something and you sell it for more. Theology. I'm going to have a theology department, you know since I'm a priest, it's only right. And what you have to learn in theology is the answer to the question where is God? And the answer is God is everywhere. Why? Because he likes you. [laughter] That's-a kind of a combination of the Disney and Roman Catholic philosophies. It's just-a perfect for the late 70s, early 80s, you know? Just perfect. Well, after the courses are all over then it's time for a little Easter vacation. No time to go to Fort Lauderdale. Only lasts like 20 seconds.. ...but what I do for you I like to turn on a sunlamp. You know, I give you a little glass of orange juice. That's-a the snack part, orange juice. And then, after vacation after you swallow it real quick then it's-a time for the final exams. I say to you como esta usted? You say muy bien. Where is God? God is everywhere. Economics, supply and demand. Then, I put on your cap and gown. I get out my polaroid camera, you know make a little snap-a flash picture for you. I give you the picture. You give me $20. I give you diploma and you're a college graduate ready to go. And.. ...I'm-a not, I'm-a not-a sure but I'm pretty sure right next door to the five-minute university I might open up a little law school. You know, you got another minute? [laughter and applause] Why don't you put a little hair on my chest, too? Really make 'em wonder. [Father Sarducci] 'I left Cardinal Fungi back in the men's room.' 'Was-a like 10 minutes ago he goes in there.' 'And I'm afraid. Many times he goes into bathrooms' 'and remembers how to lock the door' 'then he forgets how to unlock it.' I'm not happy with my hair color. [Father Sarducci] 'I might have to get a crowbar or something' but anyway, that's my problem. Was more than wonderful. See you later. [speaking Italian] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. It's about time you guys got back. Let's get this over with. I want to get out of here. Alright. Let's do it quick and get the hell out. Candy? Aw, man, we don't have any time. We don't even have.. Wh-where's Candy? Did she sleep here last night or something? Aw, Spiv, look at this. Wake up, Candy. Candy! Come on! We don't have all day. Come on. Get her to the mike. Alright. Here we go. Candy! Sound check. Candy! Come on! Candy, listen to me. Candy, come on, listen to me. It's a sound check. Just walk it through for us so we hear how we sound and get out. Booze! In your hand, Candy. Right here, in your right hand. There you go. Take a hit of that. There you go? Can you do it? Can you sing now, Can..? Alright. I know. One minute, guys. I know what you need because I know what you always need. Give me your nose. Here's the blowzy. Go. [inhales] Go again. Little blowzy. [inhales] That'll keep you going for a good three minutes.

That concludes the classical portion of the students of Mr. Brighton Annual Piano Recital held here at the Gus Grissom Elementary School auditorium. They made us have it here at the baby school 'cause they're having a basketball game over at the high school. Big deal. At this time, I would like to call your attention to the mimeographed lyric sheets that are inside each and every one of your programs. Could everyone please get them out, so that when I say "Please refer to your song sheets, everybody" you'll have them out ready to refer to. Could everyone please get them out now so there'll be no rustling of papers during my presentation? Okey-dokey. I would like to dedicate the song I'm about to play to the world's best mom, Mrs. Edith Leubner and to my father, the late Mr. Leubner. God rest his soul. The, uh, song that I'm about to play is the title song from the film of the same name "The Way We Were." It was composed by my idol, Marvin Hamlisch. And the lyrics were written by Marilyn and Alan Bergman with whom it's my dream for Marvin and I to someday double date. "The Way We Were." ♪ Misty watercolor ♪ ♪ Memories ♪ ♪ Of the way we were ♪ ♪ Tattered pictures ♪ ♪ Of the smiles we left behind ♪ ♪ Smiles we gave to one another ♪ ♪ For the way we were ♪ ♪ Can it be that it was all so simple then? ♪ ♪ Or has time reprinted every line? ♪ ♪ If we had the chance to do it all again ♪ ♪ Tell me, would we? ♪ [sobbing] ♪ Could we? ♪♪ Oh, no. I'm sorry. This part always gets me. It evokes the heart-breaking tragic love story of Barbra "Katie" Streisand and Robert "Hubble" Redford. The film is about, and I call it a film not a movie, the film is about this outspoken Jewish girl with a big nose who goes to Hollywood with her beautiful blond husband and gets disgusted. It was during the time when McCarthy was accusing everybody in Hollywood of being communist and even accused Streisand and Redford of being communist, which they're not and it put a terrible strain on their marriage. It was very sad. I-I saw the film five times, but I cried six times 'cause after the fourth time I knew it so well, I cried going the fifth time. ♪ Memories ♪ ♪ May be beautiful and yet ♪ ♪ What's too painful ♪ ♪ To remember ♪ ♪ We simply choose to forget ♪ Now, please, refer to your song sheets, everybody!

Could you make the hoop-a come down, please? Okay! Now, you're talking-a my language. [audience] 'Aw!' Well, it was almost. Was just a little too far. I think I can take one more shot. It's-a my prerogative. Think this-a time I can shoot just a little bit softer then it can go right in. [laughter] [audience cheering] 'Thank you.' It's not even my sport. Bocce ball is my sport. That's a gentleman sport, bocce ball. Don't have to run around like an animal. Well, I was a little sad listening to that song "The Way We Was." It was a sad one. I think that most people, when they hear a song like that they kind of project themselves into it. You think of how you used to be how you've changed over the years. I know whenever I hear that song I always think of the Catholic church.. [laughter] ...and how we've changed over the last 10-15 years. Times used to be, oh, so simple then. What we used to think was when you die the soul leaves the body. It's kind of like a little bubble in 7-Up. You know, it just.. ...just goes a-shooting up there. And we used to think there was different levels in heaven. And it depended on how holy you are the lighter the soul is. So if you're, you know, real good, a very nice person you can go way up high and be with God and, you know, other nice people like yourself. If you're a real, real bad person your soul might just raise, like, four feet. It's just, you know.. You might spend eternity hanging around the grill at some cheap restaurant. [laughter] And that's forever. Forever. I know some priests, they say forever and ever. I really don't think the "and ever" is necessary. Forever kind of covers it, you know? Forever means forever. What do you want? Forever is forever. Well, we found out that's not true. There are no levels in heaven. We found out from something called the phantom letter. Happened in 1917. There was this miracle in Portugal and these three little Portuguese kids they was given this letter and they was told "Give the letter to the Pope and tell him don't open it till 1960." 'What it was about was the secret of life' 'what happens when you die, all that stuff.' And what it said right at the top big capital letters it said, "Vitam est laborem." That means life is a job. That's why, you know, you think life seems so hard so difficult most of the time. It's 'cause it's a job. It's just-a work. That's what it's about. And it said that each of us we're getting paid 14.50 a day. That's our wages, 14.50 a day. And what happens to you when you die the soul does leave the body and then you see yourself going down this-a long, long, long dark tunnel. And your whole life flashes before you from the day you was born to the day you die. Then you come to the end of the tunnel and God is there waiting for you. And he looks you straight in the eye and then he pays you. You see, he knows you was coming. He's like a psychic. He knows everything. And he figured it up all in advance. 14.50 times the number of days you was living and he gives you all of this money. You got this money in front of you and then he starts going through your sins and you have to pay for your sins. [laughter] Maybe you heard of that expression "You have to pay for your sins." That's the truth. We do have to pay for our sins.. ...in cash. It's a cash deal. It's, like, maybe when you was a little kid maybe stole a bag of potato chips. That might be, like, $6 fine. So you got to give him back $6. 'Lying. Every time you lied, $10.' 'Ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten.' Just shell it out, you know. Every single lie, $10. You know, 10. Murder. Murder, that's-a the worst one. $100,000. Masturbation? [laughter] I don't know. [laughter and applause] Twenty five, thirty five cents would be my guess. That's a cheap sin.. ...but it can mount up. You know, 35 times.. Thirty five, thirty five, thirty five, thirty five.. Well, if you have enough money to pay off all your sins then you get to go to heaven. If you don't have enough you have to go back and be born again. It's kind of like going back to work after a little vacation. Some real bad people, you know, like Mafioso types they might have to spend four-four lifetimes as nuns just making up for it. Most nuns are former Mafiosos. Didn't know if you know that. [laughter and applause] Well, Cardinal Fungi's still in the men's room. I'm afraid he could be working up real tab back there if you get-a my drift. I better go check him out. Thank you. See you later. Thank you. Hello. Hello, Father Sarducci. Hello, Miss Litella. Hello to you. Fine, thank you. Good morning, boys and girls. I'm Miss Emily Litella. [cheering and applause] Miss. Emily. Litella. Now, this is my first time substitute teaching you at P.S. 164, in Bedford-Stuyvesant. I'll be taking the place of your regular teacher Mr. Hawks until he recovers from his unfortunate accident. I heard all about the stubbing and his toe must have smarted pretty badly if he had to be taken away in an ambulance. And I heard it was the third stubbing this week at this school. So, mind your toes. This morning, boys and girls I'll be reading to you from this book. "Tiny Kingdom." 'This is a wonderful book.' I love this book. Young man, where are you going? 'What?' What? Get fudge? I don't care for it. It's too sweet and rot your teeth. What? What? Get fucked? Oh! That's very different. Asshole! What? Settle down, all of you! Shush! 'Button your little lips now! Quiet!' This is a wonderful book. "Tiny.." "..Kingdom." By Mrs. Elizabeth Wellesley. She's dead. "Once upon a time.. "...there was a beautiful princess "who lived in a little, teeny-tiny "itty-bitty, little, teeny-tiny.. "...castle. "And one day.. "...a handsome prince came riding by "in a little, teeny-tiny "itty-bitty, little, teeny-tiny.. ...carriage." This is good. "And the handsome prince and the beautiful princess "fell in love and rode off together "to live in a little, teeny-tiny "itty-bitty, little, teeny-tiny.. "...kingdom.

Dean Vaiter, faculty graduating seniors, distinguished guests ladies and gentlemen, uh.. ...as president of the graduating class it is my pleasure to introduce this evening's guest speaker. Uh, I must confess that we were a bit frantic this morning as our originally scheduled speaker Geraldo Rivera uh, suddenly fell ill and was forced to cancel. I'm told it's nothing serious. Just a little minor surgery that had to be attended to. And I understand that Mr. Rivera is feeling better and regrets that he can't be with us this evening. Uh, however, we were fortunate to find a most distinguished replacement. She is an award-winning broadcast journalist from Channel 4's, Weekend UpdateNews Team and we do thank her for graciously accepting our last minute invitation. Please welcome Ms. Roseanne Rosanadana. Thanks a lot. Thanks. First of all.. Thanks. Thanks a lot. First of all, I got to say it's an extreme pleasure, a joy, a thrill an up and a real snappy surprise for me, Roseanne Rosanadana. To give the commencement speech to the graduating class of the Columbia School of Journalism. At first, when they called me this morning 6:30, thanks a lot. I was real excited 'cause I figured there's no greater honor than for an alumnus to give the graduating speech at his alma mater. But I suppose that I, Roseanne Rosanadana will have to wait for that honor 'cause I found out your school is not affiliated with the Columbia School of Broadcasting. But you guys was in big trouble 'cause Geraldo Rivera was sick as a dog. So I figure why not come down here and speak to the young journalists of tomorrow? Geraldo had a boil that had to be lanced. It was one of those round ones that's hard like a rock and it was on his neck. Like a lump. Even if he had it drained, you know how messy those things are, it would've got all over his shirt. It would have made you sick during your graduation. So it's just as good he's not here. Anyways, as I look out at your sweet, young tender little journalistic faces with those stupid flat black hats on with the tassels hanging off of 'em I can't help but know exactly what you're thinking. You're probably saying, "Hey, I'm a college graduate." "I spent a lot of time at school." "What does journalism have to offer me?" "What do I have to offer journalism?" "What's there to write about?" "What's there to write with?" "Should I use a pencil or a typewriter?" "What kind of pencil? A number two or darker?" "Do I bring them, or does my boss give them to me?" "If I don't, will I get fired? "I'll starve and then I'll die. What should I do?" Class of '79, for college graduates you sure ask a lot of dumb questions. I know exactly what you're going through 'cause I remember when I, Roseanne Rosanadana first entered the field. I was real nervous. Imagine, if you will, a sweet, young, idealistic little Roseanne Rosanadana fresh out of school and looking for a job in journalism. I filled out applications, I went to interviews and they all told me the same thing. "You're overqualified. You're under-qualified." "Don't call us. It's a jungle out there." "A woman's place's at home. Drop dead. Have a nice day. Goodbye." But I didn't give up. I mean, even after I had this interview with the head of personnel at CBS the Tiffany Network and this guy says to me "Ms. Rosanadana, why don't you look for a job in the wonderful world of fast foods?" Well, I was kind of P.O'd at that. I'm walking down the hall when who do I see sitting in his office eating his lunch, but Mr. CBS himself, Walter Cronkite. Just between you and me, Roseanne Rosanadana you know what that hot-shot news guy eats for lunch? Luncheon meat on white bread with butter with one piece of lettuce that got wilted from being between the meat and the butter. That fancy-schmancy news guy's eating that pink bologna meat with white dots in it that you don't know what it is. What are those dots? Is that cheese in there? 'I thought it was a q-tip got in there' 'or maybe it was Rivera's boil' 'got in there or something.' Anyways...I really poured on the Rosanadana charm. I made him a cup of coffee. I showed him my resume. I told him a lot of journalism jokes. Finally, Cronkite says to me "Roseanne, you should have a job here at CBS." Well, everything is going great. Then, all of a sudden this wooden chair that I'm sitting on makes a...noise on the floor. Well, I thought I was gonna die. Cronkite says, "Ugh! Did that come out of you?" I go, "No way, Mr. Cronkite. I swear that didn't come out of me." So then I tried to move the chair again to get it to make the same noise. I moved that chair all over his office and I couldn't get it to make that noise again. Finally, it makes a little, tiny noise and Cronkite starts lighting matches in there. And he says, "Get out of here. You're making me sick." I felt real bad 'cause the guy was eating his lunch. Well, I probably don't have to tell a lot ofcollege graduates that Iwas real down after that. I was depressed as a dog. But I didn't give up. I said to myself, "R.R." "Yes, you can. I'm okay, you're okay" "I'm my own best friend. my mother, myself. "I have no fear of flying. I am woman, hear me roar." I didn't give up, and I made it and pretty big, I might add. So let me wrap this thing up real quick by saying it just goes to show you, it's always something. If it's not one thing, it's another. Either you can't get a job or Walter Cronkite thinks you cut the cheese in his office. It's just like this little graduation song my father sang when I went to bed. He'd tuck me in, all snuggly, put powder under my arms make sure my toes were under the covers and I'm all cute. And he'd sing to me this graduation song which was written by my grandmother, Nana Rosanadana. And I'm gonna sing it to you for your graduation. ♪ Should old acquaintance be forgot ♪ ♪ I hope you'll hear my plea ♪ ♪ Roseanne my dear ♪ ♪ You'll get a job ♪ ♪ If you listen to me ♪ ♪ Just sit quite still ♪ ♪ And don't you move ♪ ♪ During your interview ♪ ♪ 'Cause if you move ♪ ♪ Your boss will think ♪ ♪ The fart came out of you ♪♪ Goodnight, my little Roseanne Rosanadanas. Good luck class of '79. Thanks a lot. You knew it was me, didn't you? Um...I, uh.. ...remember when I was in high school. At the end of the year, they always had the prom. I made a big deal about it and it always made me miserable. I was either miserable because I didn't have a date or I was miserable because I did have a date and didn't know what to wear. But no matter what, I'll never forget what it'd be like when you'd go to school and it be nighttime and you'd walk into the gym and it wasn't a gym anymore. It was...it was a party. And all your friends from school were there but they always had on more makeup than they wore during the week and they looked better. And sometimes you had a good time at the prom and sometimes you didn't have a good time. But what I learned was, it was never the party that was the good part. It was always after the party. Like this one time, this guy, I figured he really liked me because he invited me to come over to his house and listen to a record and that was during the time when we all still lived at our parents houses. So I went with him and we went down into his basement or rec room and he put on Mel Brooks and Carl Reiner's 2,000 year old man. And we both sat down on the couch and we're listening to the record and laughing. And then he kissed me ...for a real long time. And then we listened to the record some more and laughed and then we both laid down on the couch next to each other and listened to the record some more and laughed and kissed ...and it was probably one of the most romantic times of my life and I'd like to dedicate this song to him and to that time.
