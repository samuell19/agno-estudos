No! "Man walks in his integrity and his children are blessed after him." Proverbs 20. But what if you didn't walk in integrity? What if you got lost in a bottle of booze every chance you could and ran away when your son needed you most? And what if your little boy isn't blessed, but is suffering because of you. Can God's grace change that? I'm Ethan and I'm on the train ride on a journey to fulfill my duties as a father. And this is my story. Beautiful day. Love the fall weather myself. Yeah? Ethan. Ambrose. Nice to meet ya. So, where you headed young man? To see my son Lucas. I haven't seen him since he was a baby. He's at my mom Thea's house with my ex, Sarah. Oh yeah? That's Lucas' mom. This is him, that's Lucas. Beautiful, right? You know, I keep that in my pocket. Everyday, everywhere I go with this one year sobriety coin. They told me if I put it in my mouth and it melts it's okay to drink again. Interesting concept. It hasn't happened yet though. Cute kid. Must take after his mother, huh? Wise guy. It's been a long, hard journey to get here, Ambrose. Ethan! Ethan! Coming, Mom! Cowboy stew again, huh? When are you gonna make me something good for dinner, Thea? As soon as you stop blowing your entire paycheck on booze. What's that? What'd you say? Nothing. Yeah, you did, Thea. You said something, what'd you say? Say it again. Say it again, I dare ya! Say it again. I can't work miracles. We don't have money for anything else other than ground beef and potatoes. Oh, that again, huh? I wrote you a story, Daddy. It's about me and you going fishing. You catch this gigantic. Gigantic. Every chance you get, you disrespect me, cut me down. And then you teach me how to cast, Daddy. You're never satisfied with anything. You're always complaining about something, Thea. Always complaining. You know what I think it is, you know what I think it is? I've been thinking. I think, maybe you get some kind of sick enjoyment outta doing this to me all the time, right? No. No, no. Oh that's right. Perfect little Thea, perfect little Thea. Mom of the century. Congratulations on that, Thea. And then I catch this big fish but. Is that what happens! Oh, baby him. Baby him like you always do. Encourage his stupid ideas. His ideas are not stupid. What? Go wait outside. Oh, that's right, run away. Just run away with him. Keep him soft. Keep him soft, Thea! You know, he's never gonna do anything important. He's never gonna amount to anything because of you. Because of you, just remember that, Thea. Go, go, go. And while you're out there, get me another beer. Get it yourself. It's the only father I knew, though. The only father I had. A drunk and absent one. The irony is even though she did everything she could to steer me in the right direction, I became more like my father. Aw, come on! You know, just once in my lifetime I'd like the birds to win a bowl, just once! Ain't gonna happen, John. What do you mean it ain't gonna happen? We're cursed, bro. Ethan, that's why you should make the switch to soccer, come on. Didn't we agree that you wouldn't talk soccer during football season! Soccer is a better game and you know it in your heart. Oh, I think I just vomited in my mouth. Hope, three shots for me and my pals please. No, I'm good. Yeah, yeah. Grab 'em, they'll drink 'em, trust me. Thank you, Hope. Bring it in. To the two best friends a guy could ever wish for. John, like the brother I never had. Dimitri, the father I never knew. Down the hatch, gents. Bring it on. 35, 41. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Go, go, go! E-A-G-L-E-S, Eagles! I mean in the beginning it was just me and John and Dimitri and a few other friends getting together, having a few drinks. But as time went by, I would watch them. They had this switch inside their heads, you know. They could just turn off and go back to their responsibilities. But me, I've never had that switch. You know, Ethan you and I have been good friends for quite a few years now. I've always liked you. But John, John not so much. But you I've always considered a close friend. But lately, lately you've been too hard on yourself. A man can't put that kind of weight on his shoulders. It really starts to crush his soul. You understand what I'm talking about? I guess all I'm trying to say is, I can't drink with you anymore. Okay? So I could help you. I could help you get help. Because you really mean a lot to me, my man. Are you listening to me? Huh? That's the last time Dimitri had a drink with me. Couldn't stand to see me do that to myself. Ethan are you okay? Whoa, whoa. I'm fine. Dan. I'm fine. Flags. I'm fine, bro. I'll call you, John. Ethan, maybe you should wait. No, no, no. It's, he's going out to call his son again. It's a new thing he does now when he's hammered. He's been really a self defecating man as of lately. Oh, he's only making it worse. Well, you can't stop him. He's a grown man. He can poop on his own parade if he wants. Sarah, Sarah? Sarah, can I just talk to Lucas? So I was only with her a couple months before she got pregnant. Things were good, I got a job, I was off the hooch all together. I was working, happy. And then Lucas was born. Best day of my life, ever. And then we found out he was severely autistic. Instead of waiting around for answers I just let the liquor do the talking, like always. Ethan, you know the rules. You can't talk to your son unless you're sober. And you're not sober. It's one o'clock in the afternoon, nice. I'm sober, do you hear me, I'm sober. I'm talking fine, what are you talking about? You got the child support I sent, right? Are you kidding me right now? You haven't made a payment in over four months. You know what they do to dead beat dads in Philly, don't ya? There's probably a warrant out for you at this point. Well, you called the cops? You called the cops? Are you kidding me right now? Sarah, he's my son. He's my son, Sarah! Sarah, Sarah are you there? Hang up the phone. I'm sorry, mommy's sorry. Honey, I'm sorry. Help me, Lucas. I don't know how to help you. I ran away like a little boy. What kind of man does that? That's not a father. But now I keep having this vision, you know, this dream that I'm sitting with him. Just he and I. And we're talking. He's talking to me, you know. I wanna be there for his first words, Ambrose. Ethan, hey. It's been a while. What's it been like a week? Have you been in jail? No, wise guy I wasn't in jail. I was cleaning up a little bit. I'm trying to turn over a new leaf. I've got a gift for my kid and a cake. Check it out. Top of the line. Awesome. Right. Mm-hm, well I'm so proud of you. I'm a little nervous. Can I take a beer and a whiskey, calm the nerves? How about just a beer to be safe? How about a beer and a whiskey? A whiskey for Jack. Thank you, thank you Ethan. To the kid. To the kid. Woo! Round for the chicks, come on! Ethan. Ethan! You have a phone call. What? You have a phone call. Who's calling me here? I don't know but they don't sound too happy. Um, hello? You called your son and personally promised him you would be here today. He didn't have a birthday cake. Ethan, who does that to his son? I'm done with you. You're not allowed to see him, or talk to him until you're sober for at least a year. I hope you're happy with yourself. Ethan, where are you going? Dan, I need you! Ethan, you can't drive in that shape. You're gonna have to give me your keys. No, no, no, buddy. No, no. You know, I used to blame my dad for who I've become. But I had choices, man. I mean, I coulda went right instead of left. Right instead of wrong, but I. I just kept choosing wrong. Hey, buddy. What's going on? Listen, Ethan. I gotta tell ya something. It's not gonna be easy for me, I'm not gonna lie. But I have a new roommate coming in here next week. Look, I could deal with you not paying your rent for three, going on four months. I mean, 2,000 dollars isn't worth the friendship. But I can't, I can't sit back and watch you drink yourself to death and god forbid something should happen to you here alone. And I didn't do anything about it. I wouldn't be able to live. Look, Ethan. If you would just go into rehab today, I could tell this guy that the room is taken. Please Ethan. I'm not going to rehab. You were supposed to be my best friend. Man. That's tough love. But that's the only way to deal with an addict. Sounds like he cares about you a lot. Ethan, yo, my boy. Yo, Ethan! Yo! Where you been, my man? I've been looking all over for ya. Hey. You can't be missing so long. I've been worried sick about you. Come on, your mom's been calling. She's real worried, brother. You gotta give her a call. Yeah, I'm just kind of doing my thing out here, you know. So. Tell you what, why don't you let me take you out and get you something to eat. You know, I'm mostly on a liquid diet. So, I'm trying to stay hydrated. I see you haven't lost your sense of humor. And I figured you'd say that much so here's what I did, I brought you some stuff. I know you're hungry. I got you some good Greek food. I got gyros. That's great, that's great. Why don't you take all that stuff back and bring me a bottle of Ouzo and you'd be helping me. Ethan, you know I can't do that. You know I can't do that. Yo, yo, yo! Where you going, come here. Let me talk to you for a second, will ya? I never told you this before but I had a son once. He was born premature, okay. I had him for a few days. The thing is when I met you and John you were so full of life and we had such a good time. Playing pool, watching ball games. Ethan, I felt like I had my son back. So please, I'm begging you. Let me help you. That's tough about your kid. That really sucks. But I ain't him. Life is short, Ethan! Remember there's people out there that love you. But that's how it was. I was an empty vessel. No compassion, a heart full of darkness. Some will depart from the faith by devoting themselves to deceitful spirits and teachings of demons. Yeah, yes, man! You're well versed in the word. You know Ethan, one day you're going to be the best dad in the world and I'm gonna be one proud grandma. I truly believe that. You have to believe in God and believe in yourself. And he will always be there to carry you. Even when you think you can't do something. This guy will always be there waiting for you. Okay. All right, let's get you into bed. There you are. Now we've got you all nice and warm so you should fall right to sleep. Why was the heat turned off again? It's an adult problem, Ethan. Let me worry about it. I'll find a way to get it turned back on, I promise. But I also promise I will not let you get cold. I'm gonna come in here every couple of hours to check on you, okay? Good. Because I don't want you to turn into an icicle. Although, you'd be the most handsome little icicle I had ever met. Thea? Thea! I love you. I want you downstairs waiting for me. Not upstairs babying him! Keep your voice down. So, what was your defining moment before you went downhill? Got close to that rock bottom. I hit many bottoms before I burned and crashed into the rocks. Thea! Get down here! Stop. When I get home, I want you downstairs waiting for me, not upstairs babying him. Keep your voice down, he'll hear you. Keep my voice down? Don't tell me to keep my voice down! This is my house, I'll talk as loud as I want! All right. And I want dinner on the table when I walk in that door. There's nothing on the table now, nothing! It was on the table, two hours ago when you were supposed to be home. - What did you say? - - Nothing. What did you just say to me? Nothing. - I'll heat it up. - - No you won't! Clean that slop off the floor and you're gonna make me a sandwich! Dad? Dad? Dad? Come back, Dad. Dad stop! Stop. Why did you do that to my mom? Get away from him. He's my father. No he's not, he's my father. Are you okay, Dad? Get away! I was trying to. For the first time it made sense to me, man, what I was supposed to do. I need you, John. Can you help me, man? Can you help me, brother? So my mother, she got the ball rolling. She got me in touch with the minster at my church, Father Michael. That's how I found out about Bethesda Mission. I like where this is going. "But as for me, I will look to the Lord. "I will wait for the God of my salvation." "My God will hear me." Micah 7:7, nice. Wow, I'm impressed you know that. Yeah, well what happened next is the reason I know that. It saved my life. Hello, Ethan. So this is it, huh Father? You're taking me to the Bethesda Mission. Bethesda, healing water. This is only the beginning, Ethan. Open your heart to the Lord and he will hear you. I promise you that. In a homeless shelter, Father? It is more than that. The process of your recovery is within. Let the healing begin, Ethan. Thank you, Father. I read your entire intake file. And I met with Father Michael and your mother. You're very lucky to have them in your life. You got a fresh cut and we're already taking care of ya. So let's just get to it, Ethan. Why don't you tell me why you're here? I'm a drunk. And now I'm homeless, so. I guess this is my last chance, huh? Well, you're right on the drunk and homeless part. But this isn't your last chance. In fact, it's a new beginning. The answers to every important question you have are in that book. Ethan, everyone here wants the same thing, redemption. And we all have our own demons. But the most important thing for you to remember is the relationship you build with Jesus Christ here will determine whether you are ever able to walk out those doors the right way and have a life with your boy. Your room's down in the basement. Hello? Hold on a second. Welcome to Bethesda Mission. Hey, sorry. Yeah, here we go fellas. Hey, we got some fresh meat coming, all right. Wow, man. Come on over here and get your indoctrination. You ain't sleeping down here, dude. - You can sleep, he's our boy. - Alonzo. Alonzo, Lonzo, Lonzo, Lonzo, Lonzo, Lonzo, Lonzo, Lonzo, Lonzo! Welcome to the Mission, my brother. Let me show you to your rack. Thanks. I'm so sorry. Bud, I'm so sorry, buddy. Daddy's trying. Why don't you give me another life lesson? Don't play cards with me. Yeah, well this one's mine. Oh no, whoa, okay. What kind of ice cream do you guys like? The shaking doesn't last. You'll be better tomorrow. What's the matter, man? You feeling froggy? Oh, no, no, no. Two, Michael's are even. Oh my God. What's happening? Ken, I need you to call my mom. Ethan, no, no, no. - I need you. - I can't call your mom. I am cold, bro. I don't know what's happening to me. You're going through something that happens. And it's okay, it's not real. It's gonna be gone. - No, no, I'm cold. - You gotta fight through it. You gotta fight through this. Call my mom, she's gonna come and get me, bro. I swear to God she's gotta come here. No she's not, she's not coming to rescue you. No, no, she is, she's gotta come! You've gotta do this yourself. You've gotta do this yourself. Get away from me! I don't wanna be here! We're here for you. We're here for you! So I was in that place for nine months. Meetings everyday, prayer, meditation. Discipline, you know? Everyone starts cleaning here. You gotta be kidding me. Nope. I ain't cleaning that thing. Well, that's up to you. But if you ever wanna see your child again I think you will. What's this for? It's for the, the crevasses. You gotta get in there. Yeah, thanks. I'll be back to inspect. Ugh. I had never cleaned a toilet in my life, mind you. You know why? Why? I thought I was too good for it. But while I was doing it, cleaning this nasty toilet, I had an epiphany, you know. I realized for the first time I was no better than anyone of those people. I was just another guy. Garden variety alcoholic trying to get another day of sobriety. There was many people in there that were just as sick as me. No, yeah, I'm going to China. There it is. So this is how it works, I think. Basically, let's do it. Let's do it for real. You roll the dice and then you pick a card up, you roll the dice and then. Hand it out when you're done. Keep the door open. It's dirty, Ted. Come on. Zero tolerance, guys. Hey Ken, I need to see my kid, man. You're not ready. I am ready, in fact it's all I think about. I need to see my kid! I need to call him, at least! Which is why you're not ready! You think you have the reward of seeing Lucas without thinking about the work you need to do on you to make it happen! You want the reward without putting in the work. You want the easy road, just like always. It's your fatal flaw. Put in the work and with God's help and through his grace, you will see your son again. I promise. All right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, all right. Thea, he left. He was doing so well. Do have any idea where he might be? Really? You're gonna throw all that work down the drain? About to lose yourself in that bottle, again. You know, this isn't just about you, Ethan. Your son needs you and you're about to blow it, man. I guarantee you, you take one drink from that bottle and your misery will be refunded to you 100%. Trust me, I know. And you'll lose your kid. You will never see him again, ever. But you know, if that's what you want big man, have at it! But if you ever wanna do the right thing, you know where I'll be. Yo, wait up! Hold up. Hey Mike. You're not doing it right, pal. You gotta get under the lip first. You can do it. I'll be back to inspect. It wasn't a revolution, bro. No, but you didn't have to. This being my last day with you men and women I wanna part with these words. You're never, ever gonna be happy and find peace until you turn your will and your life over to the care of God. Rely on God and have faith that you can do this. I was so lost when I got here. And I was told that he could handle it. So I did, I turned it over and here I am. And if he was able to handle me, trust me he could handle anyone of you. I tried to do it on my own and in my own way so many times I've lost count. And I failed every single time. Be truthful, ask God for guidance, and always remember, be patient. God has three ways of answering. Yes, no, and wait. I heard when I first got here that whenever there's two people seeking God that he's usually there. And although we can't see him and some of you new people can't feel him, I want you to know that he's here, right before your eyes. And I'm living proof of that. So before I part I wanna call you fine men and women up here to lay your hands upon me as we close with the Serenity Prayer followed by the Lord's Prayer. God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference. I tell you what, it's pretty painful, Ambrose. To see your kid growing up through pictures. But you turned it all around. You faced your demons, stood up to them, became a better man. That's something you should be proud of, Ethan. Yeah, but I just hope I could help him. I mean, I hope I can sit across from him and hear him speak. I mean, wouldn't that be something? With God's touch anything is possible. All the Father has to do is take his hand and put it on your boy's lips. Man, I wish it were that easy. Unfortunately, nothing is. Prayer is a powerful thing, Ethan. It really does work, if you believe. What do you pray on the most? If you don't mind me asking. Well, lately I've been having a recurring dream that kind of includes a prayer. It's me in a park with me as a child. And Lucas is there. And all three of us are playing. And I hold them both up close to me and I whisper in their ear. What do you whisper to them? I love you. God loves you, forgive. Why do you think you pray on that? It brings me hope. Dinner's ready! Pork? Oh, Oodles of Noodles again. You love Oodles of Noodles. Yeah, but not every night. Eat it. Aren't you gonna eat? I'm not hungry, honey. Mom? Yes. How come Dad never gets home until after I'm asleep? He works long hours. Some of the kids at school say he's the town drunk. Who said that? Some kids. Is he? Your father uses alcohol for relaxation. Some men build models, your father has a few drinks. Is that why we don't have any money and you can't eat? Stop it. A boy your age shouldn't have to think about such things. Does he still love us? Of course he does. He doesn't even talk to me. Why? Now look, I'm gonna tell you something and I want you to listen to me good, okay? I love you with all of my heart. And I will always take care of you. And I'm going to make sure that there's clothes on your back and food in your belly. And I'm going to make sure that you have everything that you need to be a good man, I promise. And I will always love you and you will always be my little man, you understand me? It still hurts? Yeah. Yeah, I still haven't made peace with my dad. We haven't spoken in years and I'm not sure I even want to, you know? I heard through the grapevine he's been trying to contact Lucas and me. He wants to make peace. I don't know, I'm just not feeling it. Well. I hope things work out with you and your dad. You don't wanna regret not making peace with him. I mean, if the man wants to make peace, make peace. We all deserve a second chance, right Ethan? I just keep thinking, what if he doesn't forgive me? Ethan, you made this decision yourself. You've come a long way to get clean. You decided to fly right for your kid. You should be proud of that. Come on, let's go. All right, after you. This is a big day for you, huh? Yeah, I'm still nervous. Hey listen. I got something for ya. Oh, Dimitri. For you. No, man I can't take that. Yeah, look, look. Put it back in your pocket, Dimitri. Come on. Come on, my father gave this to me in Greece when I was a kid. Yeah, I know. Just before we came to America. It brought me good luck on my journey and in my life and I'd like to pass it on to you for luck on your journey. Okay? It's from my heart. It's a Greek tradition, you gotta take it. You gotta accept it. I guess I have no choice, huh? That's right. Enjoy, man. You're a gem. Thank you. A Cristo. What'd you say? A Cristo. Very good, my man, very good. I told you if you listened to me. I love you. Your Greek is getting much better. That thug, man. This guy's causing enough trouble over here. Excuse me a minute, guys. It won't be long, I promise. Are you sure you wanna mess around with that guy? Yeah, let me, I can handle him. Dimitri, be careful, bud. Hey yeah. How many times have I gotta tell ya, huh? Come on, I'm trying to run a business here. You're playing music like it's a DJ op or something. Yeah, but this is my business you're disturbing. You want me to call the cops, huh? Is that what you want, huh? You see this? Oh, okay. John, we gotta go. Yeah, sure. You're a piece of dirt. I'll knock your teeth down your throat. Just get outta my place. Get outta my sight. I'm not gonna put up with it anymore. Unbelievable. These guys. Mother Mary, that was kind of loco. Are you all right? Yeah, this kind of stuff happens all the time. Take it easy. Look, I'm sorry you had to see this, man. You know, what are you gonna do? Listen. I'm gonna miss you my friend. I gotta go, guys. - Hey, I'll walk with ya. - Okay, all right. Stay away from that guy. Yeah, be careful. York Haven, Pennsylvania, ladies and gentlemen, last stop. Well, I guess this is my stop. It was nice hearing your story, Ethan. You're gonna be a great dad. Thanks. You know what I can't. I can't do it, I can't. I'm not ready for this, man. You gotta get off here, my friend. No, no I'm not ready. He's not gonna accept me the way that I am now and I'll just book another trip. Look, boy! I did not sit here for the last hour and a half listening to your story for you not to get off this train and to go see your son. You know why you're gonna go see your boy today? Your gonna go see him for all those men at the home who never got the chance to. You're gonna do it for all of those toilets of humility you had to scrub to take down that ego of yours. You're gonna do it for John, and Dimitri, and your mother because they believed in you. You're gonna do it to break the cycle because your father couldn't. Because you are a strong man, Ethan. And most of all you're gonna do it because your son needs you. A son needs his father. But you know that better than most men. He needs you to be there for him. To care for him. To protect him. Because that's what a parent does. You're right. Thank you. You do all the thanking I need by taking care of your boy. Now get your narrow butt off this train. I'm gonna go see my kid. Fall has a lot of symbolism. Something I think about when I look around is how much things change in fall. Life giving foliage makes way to a colorful orchestra of leaves that eventually wither away and slowly descend upon the cold, hard earth. A gray marble sky constantly lingers overhead accompanied by dreary weather trying to suffocate all that it touches. That sounds a bit pessimistic, though, right? I guess it all depends on how you look at it. One can, for instance, notice all the brilliance of the colors of fall and see that this season does have a life of its own. Unfortunately though, only when our immortality complex wears off do we actually understand that tomorrow is no guarantee. The weather can do what it wants because the optimism of having a son breathes new life into me. He is life. He is the spring and summer after a long, cold, unforgiving fall and winter. But it's amazing how a little boy can teach a grown man his most important lesson in life without uttering a single word. How to forgive. I remember these tracks well. They lead back to my mom's house. I walked them 1,000 times when I was a boy. Now I'm walking them to see my son. I hope I can do this. Please God, give me the strength to walk these tracks to my new life. To be a loving, strong, and kind father. How long has it been since you've heard from him? About an hour and a half. He said he'd call as soon as he got to town. Train takes about 90 minutes. Well, if I know my son, which I think sometimes I do. He'll be good here good and late. Lucas! Do you remember me, bud? I'm your dad. You remember me? Come here. Lucas! Lucas is gone, check the front. Lucas! No! I was calling for ya, you didn't see me? Yeah, I'm your dad. Lucas! How many times have I told you not to play near the street? Promise me you will never do that again. Is he okay? Get inside, get inside. Mom, I had him. Guys, it's cool, I'm here. Guys why aren't you listening to me? Bud. I love you, bud. Cute kid, indeed. What are you doing here? This part is always hard for me to say. - What are you talking about? - Why can't they hear me? The living can't hear you, Ethan. You're passing on. No, no, no. You're crazy. See for yourself. Wait, but I was on the train about an hour and a half ago. Time is irrelevant at this point. You are not physically here, Ethan. I gotta go, guys. Hey, I'll walk with ya. All right, stay away from that guy. Yeah, be careful. You are physically still at the deli. I traveled all this way, though man, I'm here. Look at me, I'm standing right here. Only your spirit is here, Ethan. Here, at the end of your journey. Your mission was to protect your son from harm. And you did just that. I did. You're right, I did, and I don't want that to end. I wanna be here. I wanna be his father. I wanna stay right here. Can't that change? Look man, I spent my whole life trying to get a purpose and trying to be a dad. I finally get it and you're trying to take it away from me, man. You're right, Ethan. You learned what your purpose is. What your whole reason for being on this earth was. And because you have worked so hard at being a good father to your son, I'm going to reward you through the Father through whom all things are possible. Ethan. The father is going to let you talk to your boy one last time. He's gonna talk to me? Hey, Lucas. Hi bud. Look. I got a picture of you. I carry this with me wherever I go. Because I love you. And. And I just wanna know what it is, what can I do for you Lucas? All the father has to do is take his hand and put it on your boy's lips. Lucas. Speak. I forgive you, daddy. I love you, daddy. I don't want you to leave. Oh buddy, I don't wanna leave, either. I love you so much, kid. But I gotta go. I'm always gonna be right inside here, okay. And I'm always gonna watch over you and your mom. I gotta go, bud. Lucas? Did you say something, baby? I was talking to Daddy. He's my angel, Mommy. Baby, you're talking. He said he'd always be with me. Our Father, who art in heaven. Hallowed by thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses. As we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil.
