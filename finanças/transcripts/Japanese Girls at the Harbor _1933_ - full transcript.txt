Michiko Oikawa Yukiko Inoue Ureo Egowo Ranko Sawa Yumeko Aizome Tatsuo Saito Yokohama On the Settlement Hill On the way... To and... From school We two are left alone. We'll always be alone. Watching ships makes me feel sad. Maybe I belong here. Love Give me a lift. Hang on. On the way... To and... From school We're left alone again. Dora, I'm sorry. I apologize for having left you behind yesterday. That's all right. I don't mind. Instead, I wish you and Henry every happiness. Thank you. Church Clean but cold flower garden After that, the two go to... The sea... The mountains... And town. They're happy in every respect. But love is something changeable. Henry hasn't seen me lately. I wonder why. What are you thinking? Are you thinking about Sunako? Don't play with her. Are you still thinking? Let's go home fast. I'll hang on. Henry. Henry. Henry. I hear you're with punks again. You often go to see Yoko Sheridan. Don't you feel sorry for Sunako? Wait on the hill as usual. I don't want to see him anymore. Don't say that. Henry's trying to go straight. You must see him once again. She shouldn't have met him after all Because... I was expecting your visit here. Let's practice dancing. We promised to go to the ball on the President Asia. Sunako, go to the ship this instant! Go for him there. He's dancing with Yoko. Don't you think I know better? If you really love him, you'll forget his misconduct. To love, you must be generous. Don't stay at a place like this. Why so timid? It's not like you. We'll marry in God's presence. God! But -- God didn't forgive her. Read her diary to learn what happened after that. I drifted from Yokohama to Nagasaki to Kobe. I'm leaving Kobe. I'll move to Yokohama. I wish I could go, too. Want to see someone there? Going home to Yokohama? What about that deadbeat? He follows me wherever I go. I can't get rid of him. Who on earth is he? A painter. He's stuck with me since I was in Nagasaki. I'm asking what he is to you. Husband? Lover? Servant? Guess. And Yokohama Home You came home early. They say Sunako has changed completely. Dull business and this rain. What a life! Sunako, I'll go home. So will I. Aren't you Henry? Sit down. Will you drink? Seems I'm in the way. I'll get lost. I wonder how Dora's doing. Know anything? Maybe I asked in the wrong way. Are you two happy? I wish you every happiness. It's time for me to go home. Or will you be my client? I only joked. My best to Dora. A new woman neighbor asked if there was a good job. Why don't you worry more about yourself? Drawing me won't make you any money. Morning A guest. This is no place for you. I couldn't help but come. Henry's working hard. You have a happy home. Did you come to hear me congratulate you? First off, this is no place for women. Did you get a good job? There are so many people. Too many in the world. Sunday I'll drop in somewhere. Stay away from decent people's homes. I think I can get some money from them. I haven't congratulated you yet. Maybe this is the only place where I'm welcome. I'm glad you came. Cook her something delicious. I think I'll leave. Why not walk her home? Don't do this. I feel sorry for Dora. We'd walk along the roads here. That road. This road too. We came all this way. Will you do me a favor? I want you to lead a decent life again. I can't stand seeing you so unhappy anymore. You can't even imagine how... I wish I could return to a decent life. But I guess it's just a dream. Thinking that way, I'm sad. Let me cry, leaning on you. Has your wife already gone out? My "wife"? I haven't met her. Isn't she your wife? Does she look my wife? Let me wash for you. Is Sunako in? She's out. What exactly are you to Sunako? Guess. You aren't her brother. Or a mere stranger. Much less her husband. By the way, what are you to her? Guess. Not her brother. Not a stranger. Absolutely not her husband. Did you wash my underwear? The neighbor woman offered to do it. That's why. She needs money. Take her this. I'm quitting. I'll go somewhere else. Long hardships, short life... Want a parting gift? Masumi, take me with you. Sorry, I can take care of only myself. Crime doesn't pay. 'Bye. You didn't know? I'm amazed. Does Henry see Sunako that often? Shouldn't I have told you? What is Sunako thinking? That's the problem. Did you come to see Sunako? What about you? Don't misunderstand. Don't misunderstand what? Look what you've done! I've lost my only link to a decent life. I hate Henry! Don't you understand why I hate him? Get out! Did your wife permit you to come? Why do I need her permission to come? You're here as my client. I want to talk to you. I don't want to talk with you seriously. Where's Henry? Don't ask me about your husband. I thought you knew best about him. You think I'm such a woman? You mean I'm wrong? Don't misunderstand! I'll be a mother before long. But Henry comes home late and drunk every night. Maybe it's my fault. I've been spoiling myself. I thought you're the only ones who'd welcome me. We've always welcomed you. I've been relying on it too much. And it's caused this. So you're here after all? Dora looked so lonely, knitting her baby's socks. What should I do? Go home and learn how to be a good father. Think about a nice name for your baby. That's best. I'm afraid I talked too much a while ago. After a storm comes the calm. Take good care of Henry. Henry, Dora, where shall I go? Poor woman! The doctors gave up on her. So it's you, Sunako! This is the end of Yoko Sheridan. I'm dying a lonely, miserable death on a rainy night. But maybe it's my just reward. I wonder how Henry and Dora are. They got married and are happy now. Keep away from them, all right? I wish I'd known sooner. But they're happy. You mustn't end up like me. Return to a decent life soon. What if the world won't forgive me? Be patient and wait until it does. Do you think the world will so easily forgive us, after all that? I get it! I'll wait! I'll wait for forgiveness! I'm glad I met you. Farewell to Yokohama What'll happen to me? Nothing wrong with having a fellow traveler. Throw them away. They sent you good wishes. "JAPANESE GIRLS AT THE HARBOR" THE END
