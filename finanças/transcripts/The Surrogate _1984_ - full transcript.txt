a little earlier we wouldn't have this problem right uh did you see foreman why what are the old did she say anything just because you don't like her doesn't mean she can't do us some good what's this us stuff i don't need the creepy old woman i'm not crazy and i am right calm down that's not what i said no but you think i'm the problem right you can't stand to share the blame if you're talking about sex i'm ready and willing when you're able huh i could break your goddamn neck hey i can't tell a thing so what do you got here yoko from out of town staying at the fair crest the me thinks it happened about a half hour ago so what about the eyes pierced they'll be counting stab wounds all night you know you really gotta hate somebody to do that kind of damage what you think we got here a

my ulcer later take it easy i'm still drinking those champagne splits now george right i recognize jakarta what are you doing down here i had a late business dinner i was heading home saw the commotion yeah there's a nasty bit of business back there oh any connection to the other one nah it's just some other time i got lucky with this date look do you wanna have a drink i'd like to talk to you about the panel you told me are you having problems with the electrical system yeah i've had it in six times okay bring it in again okay how's yours running great i'm sure we got the same mechanic okay george i'll take a look at it myself all right it's getting ridiculous i feel like i'm losing my mind i can't go on like this don't you understand i blacked out again last night i woke up in my car for christ's sake frank the neurological tests show absolutely nothing so it must be a hysterical manifestation i also think that it's time we approach this problem in a whole new way the problem is lee she makes me feel so so inadequate it never stops lee is only part of the problem but she's also part of the solution now will you please sit down frank the situation is absolutely clear you and lee simply must begin to relate to the same stimulus are you familiar with the term sexual surrogate oh for christ's sake now will you please hear me out i'm not suggesting a substitute lover for either lee or yourself a nuke vanderlin is a sexual fantasist she will work with you and lee to bring you to a harmonious level of sexual response by fantasy stimulation if i'm right about your rage being triggered by feelings of sexual inadequacy then your anger should be considerably reduced fantasy should also reveal an enormous amount about how you really feel about each other fantasies and what do you mean we go see her she shows us dirty movies french postcards what wow that would depend on the fantasy and you don't go to her she comes to you or wherever your fantasies take you well i can think of a few that would take us right to jail well i admit that the treatment is highly unorthodox but it's quite legal i assure you frank that i wouldn't recommend this unless i thought there was some valid need now if you and lee are to regain any happiness you've simply got to straighten out your sex lives the choice to participate is yours of course so heard any bad jokes lately cut it out frank you know i can hardly breathe around you these days we can talk lee i won't bite your head off it's better than talking so down jesus case i can't touch you so don't i'm sorry it's been a while i just wasn't ready look why won't you even consider forward suggestion jesus you're brilliant you know porno therapy you make it sound like a pta meeting come on lee we're obviously not responding to each other why don't we just get an impartial observer you do what you want frank you just leave me out of your sick plans i'm warning you i won't have some stranger scrutinizing our sex life such as it is no thanks to you sir what do you need uh miss vanderlin i'm sorry to be calling so late i'm told you uh you might be able to help me yes yes i was given your you know eric this latest trick is the absolute end at least he had the decency to tell me about it before he left for work this morning i can see greeting a sexual fantasist at the door in curlers in a ratty old housecoat tell me love what does one wear to a fantasy oh i suppose simple strand of pearls and a black velvet ribbon kinky i can't go through with it though what are you crazy or something of course you can all you gotta do is think nighty thoughts you know what i mean yeah what's easy for you to say well there's nothing worse than having a heart on an address especially if it's not your heart off be serious eric what kind of fantasies do you suppose she specializes in oh good lord love don't ask me i have enough trouble dealing with real life do you remember mrs reynolds in 6b now there was someone stranger than fiction now what are you talking about i'm talking about her round bed with satin sheets and the leather bed spread doesn't that sound a little funny to you no i'm not kidding eric i'm really scared well why don't we practice come into my office darling you tell me your fantasies and i'll tell you mine it'll be heaven no i don't have any fantasies yours would be too confusing for my little brain and well you know help today eric i might as well go home and face the music very darling we call mrs reynolds and get some of her fantasies it'll be fabulous you know i could kill you for this i've been a nervous wreck all day long well if it's any consolation you i'm just as nervous as you are so let's just take it step by step and see what happens okay maybe you're right who knows we may even enjoy it eric thought it would be kinky where do you get out discussing our personal problems that lunatic at least he talks to me without we will shouting someone to talk to make an impression hello may i come in uh this is the weight residence uh yes yes it is please come in uh how do you do miss standard and i'm lee it's nice to meet you you've uh this is my husband frank frank would you like a drink oh yes do you have uh anything i think back to a wonderful evening in nice i would like tonight to be that special for you oh viva la france you speak french no don't match maybe i'll teach you you had a beautiful house thanks it's a condominium such lovely things well come in please uh sit down isn't it amusing how rooms and objects reflect our true self last night i put on this tape thinking of the visit i would make here with you music is so important to me is it youtube i love music of longing and desire it's so soothing your accent is very unusual where are you from i was born in jakarta my father was a french diplomat i learned english at the hague and the american school i'm fascinating the immigration people think so they always take so much time with my passport but that's all they're doing i'm sure they took their time but not because of your passport you find it attractive i like that and julie do you find me attractive yeah sure you're very beautiful look such powerful hand it must feel good when it caresses you i wouldn't know he doesn't touch you that's absurd frank she doesn't like to be touched nonsense everyone likes to be touched properly gently slowly smoothly you must reach into the other person's soul to make them one with you touching is the first stage of passion now close your eyes living in a world of total darkness it is quiet you feel all alone all alone in your silence and someone touches you caresses you gently it is your lover your heart goes out to him longing for the comfort that only can bring let's go relax his touch is so central so and your passion awakens soft like slowly draining warm like a tropical breeze like a wave deep within you growing stronger and fulfillment you did me sorry look uh uh i'll talk to foreman tomorrow all right okay frank i wanted to help i do it just feels wrong it feels wrong damn stupid idea well at least you're transferring some of your hostility from lee to me don't be flip the least you could have done is warn me good god frank don't be so naive what did you expect a sexual fantasist to do come over for cake and coffee i told you the treatment was unorthodox jesus who is this a nook character i felt the treatment she offers could be effective she's had quite a bit of experience out west yeah i'll bet tell me exactly how you felt you were aroused weren't you oh yeah what good did it do frank your rage attacks are the hysterical expression of your sexual frustrations control the frustrations and i believe you'll considerably control your temper it's a preliminary diagnosis i must admit but consider this you came in here today angry but handling it right i don't know what about lee how'd she react oh christ it's a wonder she's still talking to me she got off on it she won't admit it might you i never would have believed if i hadn't seen it with my own eyes how did you feel about that i don't know with me she's a piece of stone but there she was the ice queen turned on by another woman and you weren't what kind of fantasy was that another woman climbing all over your wife well that would depend on whose fantasy it was wouldn't it i'm telling you this car was unbelievable typical italian seats you know yeah yeah lie down i think i love you it looks like it's doing 110 standing still no rear view mirror besides what

getting at lee why don't you just come out and say it mind let's get back to forming what she had to say oh she thinks we probably overreact because we've been repressing our sexual responses for so long oh great i'm weird because i don't like to be pawed by some sex-crate foreigner i really think you should see another psychiatrist play another tune will you you'll see through her one of these days she also thinks it would be a good idea for you to see her again afterwards she pulled be a cold day in hell before i see her again just think about it all right okay i'll think about it but if i

simple girl trying to make a living i only do fantasies part time otherwise i work for regal loungewear what yes your wife looks like a very good prospect she's rich and beautiful you're kidding what are you selling lingerie this is midnight madness fearing you very dirty the egyptians knew that passion and smell were controlled by the same part of the brain they believed that perfumes and centered oils were aphrodisiacs all fragrances were created to excite and arouse the opposite sex pray no man you see yes that's uh very nice it's very fresh it's fresh beautiful like the rose don't let it break you otherwise you'll have to learn to wear the bloodlines very impractical but erotic a woman is so much more desirable with a little mystery don't you think it is there to tease and

that knife felt so useless yeah i felt the same way i was so scared that crazy bride you know it's even more frightening because i think she may be having some effect oh i don't know but i seem more in control spent all weekend together we haven't tried to kill each other he seems to be transferring my anger to these fantasies and turning it back onto me those sessions that are so vulgar they're so humiliating is that what you're saying you need to hurt me no you don't think that i don't say anything to get you into bed but if you're duke just leave the cycle analyzing the foreman oh great she's the one that got us into this mess in the first place boldlike probably has a thing with her what are you talking about a milk and foreman real cozy i bet talk about paranoid delusions well here's one a nook is one of her patients what listen it makes sense right we know a nook's not exactly normal i'll bet foreman is treating her for what sadistic nymphomania laugh all you want it would be just like the good doctor to use one patient against another for treatment but a nook is off a nut exactly that's what makes it so scary don't you see foreman's lost control now as bizarre as it seems you may be right you know foreman has been very vague about this inuk's background christ i'll bet it's something like that i've got an appointment tomorrow with foreman i'll find out what's going on guy looks like a pin cushion classic edifying mutilation just like the others bought it thursday or friday probably been in there the whole weekend nice night well well john mannion the company yuki okay covered up and look i don't want to press for 24 hours nothing i've been on this town bike all morning and i haven't even made it across the room thank god i haven't got a paper route darling frank's been different lately there's something strange i don't even know what's going on anymore well i hope you've had better luck finding out that i have what's that's supposed to

police hello this is mrs lee wait that's the lady we've established that the first murder happened two weeks after she moved here from california we know that she hung out at barrington's in the market district where two of the victims were last seen and we know that she saw a foreign just before fulman was killed what's the connection to the shrink we're not sure if she was a patient uh probably unofficially because there's nothing on record but we have had a look at her past and it's pretty damn bizarre any lead yeah we have a good authority that she's out there somewhere i don't care how you do it just find her look approach her with a lot of caution okay guys look the gap between the murder is getting closer and closer she's running on a very short fuse so be careful now get out to hit the street i was right to call the police they're out looking for her now at least now i'll get some protection when you put that drink away you're always drinking why don't you just answer the door i'm sure cops have seen a man drink before hello make no mistake about it take your clothes off frank stop her please quiet i'm warning you get out of here or i'll kill you big talking the cops are on their way over here if you leave now you have a chance perhaps this time the treatment will be more difficult you're hurting me hate this fantasy you're crazy you've killed him you didn't
