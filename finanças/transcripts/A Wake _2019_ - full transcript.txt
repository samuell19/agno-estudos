(glass breaks) (train horn faintly honks) - [Mason] The dream is always the same. No one's around, I don't know where I am, but I know you left something for me. (calming music) My 22. I know it's you, Mitch. And there you are. (calming music) (train horn honks) I can't reach you. - Your mother called me yesterday. She seems to think you're doing better, that maybe these sessions aren't necessary anymore. Mason. Do you think your mother's right about that? - She's my step-mother. - Right, sorry. Anywho, she suggested that Mitchel's wake this afternoon might be the closure that you need. - Vanessa doesn't even want to have the wake. - You call your step-mother Vanessa? - Not to her face. - I see. It's my professional opinion that matters of emotional and spiritual... (radio static buzzes) Stay in shape. You know what I mean? How are you grieving for your brother, Mason? - What do you mean? - I'm asking, for example, have you cried for him yet? - No. - [Rob] Not even once? Why is that, do you think? - I don't need to. - Sometimes we think we don't need something that might actually help us. - Do you think it's possible for us to communicate with the dead? - You mean Mitchel? - I've been seeing him in my dreams. - [Rob] I think that's very common when we lose a loved one. - I think he's trying to tell me something. - I think God will guide him to you. - How? - Let's pray about this, hm? Dear Lord. We come to you on this day of young Mitchel's wake. We ask that you watch over Mason and his family as they remember and cherish their- - [Mason] Pastor Rob doesn't believe me. He doesn't even ask God to help me find you. - [Rob] Show him the way to healing as only- - [Mason] Sometimes I think I have more faith than he does. Please, Mitch. I know you're there. (woman sings) - 18, 19, 20, 21. Knew it. There's a problem! - Of course. - What is it, Molly? - We're short something. - Hey, Mollypop, relax, don't worry about it. - But we put 21 items on the grocery list, and there's only 20 items in the grocery bags. - I think we checked at the store, sweetie. - But I counted twice. - Okay, what did we forget? - I don't know. - I hope it's the turkey gizzards. - I put those on the list! - Nothing personal, Mollypop. - Grandmother, stop calling me that! - Hey, hey, hey. Show some respect. - My name is Molly. Besides, we got the gizzards. - Damn it. - Loretta. - That's one dollar, I'm adding it to the list. - [Vanessa] I have never heard a grandmother and granddaughter bicker like you two. - Gizzards was Mitchel's favorite. - Yuck! Must've gotten that from Vanessa. - All right, can we just drop the gizzards please? I'm sure we'll be fine with the things we did get. - [Molly] Mother? - Yes? - Please don't yell at me, but I know what it is. - What? - The candles. - Molly, don't we have those at home? - No, I checked. - All right. Well, Pastor Rob is coming at 4:30, which means we don't have time to go back. - No! - Look, Molly, I know that you've worked really hard planning this wake, but maybe we can just skip the candles, okay? - But it's part of the ceremony! - All right, do you just want to cancel the whole thing? - Of course not! - Vanessa, please. Any excuse. - Let me try her brother, he should be finished with his church by now. - Mother, it's illegal to use your phone while driving. - Yes, I know. But this is the only way we're gonna get the candles. Just, please pick up. Please pick up. (dramatic music) - [Jameson] Grandpa? - In here. - I'm just headed out to the basketball court. - Are you an imposter? - Grandpa. - You must be an imposter. My grandson hasn't been out to the courts in months. - Well, I'm going today. - You gonna be back for dinner? - Maybe a little late. - Well, take your phone. - Why wouldn't I bring my phone? - Just take your phone and call me if it starts getting dark before you get back. - Love you. (dramatic music) - We were only 4 when we started tricking people, right after mom died. Do you remember that? No one was paying attention after the funeral. I put on those stupid overalls that you loved so much, took a marker, and drew her picture on the wall in your room. Dad caught me, but he didn't say a word. He thought nothing was more fun than making people believe that you were me. But then you didn't want to do it anymore. I never knew what happened, just grown out of it, I guess. But then there was that last time. (dramatic music) Oh, Jesus. I thought you were Vanessa. - Hey, Mason, I need your help. - What's up? - Is tomorrow your short day? - Yeah? - Could you cover my last period for me? - You want to switch? What class? - Biology. - Grier? Dude, he hates me. - No, look, he's not gonna ask you any questions. - [Mason] But his class is so boring! - Look, I wouldn't be coming to you if it wasn't important. - Well, what it is? - Look. I can't tell you right now, but I will, all right? Can you please just trust me on this? Please? - Thomas? - That's me. - Okay. What should I do with my bag? - Oh! - [Megan] I got it. - Hey, are you an actor? - What? - I mean, you look like you can be an actor. - Oh, yeah, you know... - I am. - Cool. - I'm an actor. So- - I work in tech. - Oh, tech. People must hate you. - Thanks. - No, I didn't... I don't, I just- - You work for tech. - I do. Sorry. - Do you like it? - Working for- - Driving people places? - Uh, yeah. Well, so far. My first day. - Really? - I wouldn't lie. So, what brings you out here? - Um, I'm going to my parents' house. Well, my dad and step-mom. - Oh, sounds like trouble. (Megan chuckles) - Perceptive. - Actor. - Right. - Well, if it's anything like visiting my mom and step-dad, I'm usually trying to run the other way. - I don't have a choice this time. - Did you grow up here? - Mhm, born and raised. - Cool, me too. Where'd you go to high school? - Orchard. - Oh. Connolly. Class of 2011. - '09. - Nice. - Hey, could you just drop me off at Howard's around the corner? - Oh, yeah. I know where it is, it's just kind of far from where you dropped the destination point. - Yeah, I know. - I guess I could reschedule the- - No, no, no, don't do that. Just like, yeah, go ahead and charge for the full ride. - No, I mean that wouldn't be fair, I- - It's totally fine. - Did I do something wrong? - No, no, not at all. - I figured there'd be like a crystal ball or something. - That is only for show. - All right, um... What do I need to tell you? - Nothing. Just give me your hand. You have experienced a loss. Well, good news is, you're headed in the right direction. - What if someone's trying to communicate with me? - Well, if the deceased are trying to reach you, they'd have to find me. - Okay, well, what about like summoning them? - It doesn't work like that. Now, they can choose to do it through me, but I can't make them. There are a lot of quack mediums out there son, I am not gonna try to fool you. But if you sense someone's trying to reach you, then they probably are. - Oh my God. 22. - Powerful number. Turn your dreams into reality. - I've been dreaming about it. - Dreaming? You know anything about numerology, son? The truth seeker is represented by the number 7. Now, you divide 22 by the number 7 and you get an approximation of pi. Definition of a perfect circle. But it's just an approximation, an imperfect circle. If you're dreaming about 22, you may be seeking the other half of that circle. But, honey, there's some not-so-good news. Someone's unhappy with you. - My brother? - I don't know. It has something to do with your brother anyway. But this'll help. Take it, it's yours. - Will it protect me? - No one thing can truly protect us, but it'll guide you. (dramatic music) - [Molly] Father? - Oh, hi, sweetie. I was just... Whenever anyone leaves a message on his wall, a notification- - I thought we weren't supposed to go into Mitch's room. - Well, I was thinking that it might be nice if we found something of his to share with everyone today. - Like a picture? - That's a great idea. - I hope you're planning to get dressed soon. The wake starts at 4:30. - Don't you worry. - What are you two up to? - I was just looking for a picture of Mitch to share. Did you get the groceries? - We did. Molly, what is that? - Delivery for Mason. - Here, let me see it. - Where's grandma? - Could you go help her with the groceries, please? Maybe it's time to start thinking about clearing out this room. - [Richard] What? - Just a thought. - [Richard] Let's just focus on honoring him today. - [Vanessa] I didn't know you were so invested. - [Richard] Well, of course I am. - Okay! Who's planning to take a shower? 'Cause we only got 38 minutes and two showers. - Molly, there's no need to yell. - Grandmother! - [Loretta] Present! - Okay, we need to figure out the showers. Pastor Rob in 38 minutes and counting! ♪ Your heartache, it kills me ♪ But your lovin', it thrills me ♪ - I'll give you 5 stars. - Thanks, me too. Oh, let me pop the trunk and I'll- - Oh, no, it's okay, I'll get it. - Hey, why don't you leave it? - What? - I'll wait for you. - Don't do that, that's silly. - No, you still have like 2 miles until your parents. Here. I just had them made up. You're the first one I'm giving it. - Thank you. - Just give me a call when you're done. - Do you want to get a drink? So, what kind of acting do you do? - Um, mostly stage, and community theater. - I did drama in high school. I wasn't very good. (Thomas chuckles) - I didn't do any acting in high school, but now I'm thinking about moving down to L.A. - Oh, brother. - [Thomas] What? - I hate L.A. - Everybody hates L.A., but that's where you go. - I guess so. - What kind of tech do you do? - I'm working on an app, helps you find parking in urban areas. - Startup. - Uh huh. - So, do you always have a cocktail before you see your family? Don't worry, I have at least two, so... - I haven't been home in a while, not since my little brother died 8 months ago. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. Thank you. My little sister convinced my parents to hold this wake, and like hardly anyone's invited, and so typical. - How did he... I'm sorry, I shouldn't- - Overdose. Officially ruled accidental. - But you're not so sure? - He was a nervous kid, but also really strong. I think in some ways he held the family together. And then he started taking these painkillers or sedatives or some shit. I might need this. - Oh, you look nice, sweetie. - Are those pretzels, Mother? - Yes. - Nope. They go on the left. You see, the foods go salty, then sour, and then sweet, and last bitter. So they go on the left. - Okay, I'll try to be more careful. - [Loretta] Where do olives go? - Um, right. - I think you're missing umami, Mollypop. - What? - Umami. Umami. - Mother? - Beats me. - You're making that up, Grandmother! - I'm not, it's missing from your plan. - [Vanessa] Molly! Wonderful, Loretta. - [Loretta] It's a teachable moment. There you are. - I found this. I was thinking we could put out a picture of Mitch. - Oh, he looks happy. - Does this pass inspection? - [Loretta] Hi, handsome boy. - How do you spell it? - U-m-a-m-i. I think. - You don't think I should wear more black? - Of course not, it's cliche. - You are gonna wear a coat? - Not if I can avoid it. - I thought you were invested. - You look fine. - It is real! - Okay, let's just not worry about it, okay, Molly? - But I want to have all the flavors! - Tastes, dear. - I want to have all the tastes. - All right, let me see. - I don't see umami here. - Okay, okay, let's see what we can find in the kitchen. - Oh, dear. - Don't tell me you fell off your bike again. - Don't worry about it. - Oh, no! Not today, Mason! Not today! - [Vanessa] Cheese and rice. - [Loretta] He's just embarrassed. - [Richard] He'll be fine. - Mother? - Richard? - I'll go talk to him. - You know he won't listen to me. He'll be okay. Here. Oh, it says that tomatoes and soy sauce count. - Are you gonna tell me why we're doing this? - After, I told you. - All right, give me the shirt. - Just meet me back here after class and I'll give it back to you, all right? - Cool. (Mason chuckles) I'm definitely Mitch now. Take my picture. (sink runs) - [Richard] You okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Who did this to you? - No one. - Don't try and tell me this is a bike accident, I know what a punch looks like. What'd you get, mugged? - No. - Okay. You know the guy? You're gonna have to talk to me, Mason. - They were just- - They? - These two guys. - You're picking fights now? - No, it was just stupid stuff. - Well, what stupid stuff? - Look, they're assholes! - Hey, watch your language. - They're just taking care of something that they needed to do, okay? It's over. You don't have to worry about it anymore. - You're telling me you took care of it? Hm? Well, I hope you at least got in a few good punches, huh? Let me see. What's that? - A crystal. - Take it off. Mason. You're not taking pills, are you? - No. - Let me see your bag. - No. Just give it back! - Let go! - [Vanessa] Everything okay? - Yeah. His bike got caught on the train tracks. - Is the bike okay? - Not a scratch. - Your sister wanted to know if you remembered the candles? Mason, it's hard for your dad sometimes too. To see you like that, with your face bruised, and you know. - I do. - A package came for you. - Oh, thanks. - Didn't know you'd ordered anything. - Yeah, it's for the wake. - Well, better get dressed. (calming music) - Hey! That's my phone, you dipshit! - Fuck you, Andrew! - Faggot, you're gonna pay for that! You're dead, Mason! God damn it! - Hey. What the hell was that? - I fucked up. - Mitch, I saw you and Andrew. What's going on? - I was just trying to fix it. - [Mason] Fix what? - Andrew, he took these pictures. They're nothing, just stupid stuff. - And you're in them? - Yeah. - With Jameson? - Andrew's got P seventh period, and I had this idea I can get into his locker and you know, get his phone and delete them. And he just caught me. - Shit. - So, I panicked, and I just smashed them. - And he thought it was me, didn't he? God damn it, Mitch. Why'd you have to pull me into this? Now Andrew and his asshole friends are gonna be after me! - I'm sorry. - God, why do you have to be such a fucking pushover? You're so stupid! - You sound like dad. - Well, if you're gonna be an idiot... God. Why do you always have to do the stupid thing, and then I have to pull you out of it? You know what? Fuck you, Mitch. I'm so fucking done with your shit. - Mason, don't do that, please. Don't shut me out! Mason! Mason! (melancholic music) - I know Mitchel is with you now and that you're both looking down on us. Guide us today as we honor his memory and life. Megan. I was praying. - Don't let me interrupt. - I'm finished. Thank you, Lord. Amen. You look well. - So do you. - Bullcrud. I'm so glad you're here. - Thank you, Grandma. - You needed a break. - I did. - I don't think your parents understand. - I doubt it. Is Mason here? - In his room. Took a spill on his bike again, hit his face. - Oh my God. - I know. - Hello, Megan. - Hello, Molly. What you got there? - A taste of umami. - Did you know that's the name of a restaurant in San Francisco? Let me help you out with that. - No. It goes on the farthest right. - I'm sorry. What happened to that goofy kid I used to know? - We weren't sure you'd make it. - Didn't know an RSVP was require. - No matter. We won't be serving alcohol at this event. - Great. No hidden flasks on me. - I wasn't asking. - You two are being nasty to each other! - No, we're not, sweetie. This is just how we catch up. - Is that what you're planning to wear? - I have a change of clothes. - Good. Because Pastor Rob is coming. - I'm so glad Pastor Rob is coming. I want to be just like him. Only I want to be a Catholic priest. - I'm afraid girls can't be priests, Mollypop. - Then I'll be the first girl priest. Pope Francis will allow it, don't you think? - Molly, please stop saying that, we're Baptist. - I know! - [Vanessa] Can you two come help me in the kitchen? - Hi, Dad. - Hello, Megan. How are you? - Fine. - I thought we would've seen you before now. - It's really hard for me to get away from work, I tried. - You could try harder. We haven't seen you since you mouthed off to Vanessa at the funeral. - Our family plots are not- - Stop it. Not now. - Am I not welcome here today? - Of course you are. (Megan sighs) (Megan gargles) (knocking) - I'm changing! - [Megan] It's Megan. - Come in. I figured you were skipping. - [Megan] So did Vanessa. - She wishes. - And Dad. - Screw both of them. - Hey, Dad loves us. I heard you were in a bike accident. - Yeah, it's nothing. - You should put some ice on that. - I already did. - You know you're why I'm here, right? - Thanks. - It's been super crazy at work. Yeah, I pretty much order takeout every night and I'm only home to sleep, so. - I understand, Meg. I do. - I love you. (doorbell rings) - [Vanessa] Can somebody get that? It's Pastor Rob and Sheila. - [Molly] I can! - I'll get it! Are you with the pastor? (Jameson chuckles) - No, I'm Jameson. - Hello, Jameson. How can I help ya? - I'm here for the wake. Isn't it today at 4:30? - Yeah, that's the right day and time. - I received an invitation. - Well then, come on in. - Uh, cupcakes. - Oh, mm. Did you make these? - No. - Well, I don't bake either. You're all right by me, Jameson. Please tell me you brought some with sprinkles. - Oh, they're in there. Don't you worry. - This is Jameson. - May we help you? - [Loretta] He received an invitation to our little gathering. - Oh. Hello, Jameson, I'm Richard Christensen. - Hello, sir. - [Richard] You say you received an invitation? - Yes. - Who sent you this invitation? - It was just a card in the mail. - The invitation Molly made. - Ah. - Let me help you with that. - Thank you. - Sure was nice of you to bring those cupcakes, Jameson. - Jameson? I didn't know you were coming. - How are you, Mollysauce? - Good. But I don't go by that anymore. - Oh. I'm sorry. (Vanessa chuckles) - I'm Mrs. Christensen. It's nice to meet you. Welcome! Please, make yourself at home. - Thank you. - You'll have to excuse us, we're still getting things ready. Richard, can you come help me for a minute? - Are you still learning ballet? - No. Do you want to see the table? I organized all the food by its tastes. - Sure. - Let's not bother him with that, Mollypop. What can I get you to drink, Jameson? Soda, juice? - I'm fine, ma'am. But could I maybe use your bathroom? - [Loretta] Of course- - Thank you. - It's right down... But I guess you know. (mysterious music) - What time is it? - Uh, 3:40. - I don't want to go. - Don't. - [Jameson] Your step-mom might come home. - Not until 4:30. And Mason's at swim practice. - You think he suspects? - Probably. - You should just tell him. - I will. - Oh... I almost forgot. I made this. - You made that? - Mhm. Will you wear it? - If it matches my outfit. - Yeah. Here. (Jameson chuckles) What would your family say if they found out you were dating me? - Well, are we dating? - You're wearing the bracelet. - Yeah, if they found out I was dating a guy, they'd shit- - An African-American. - Well, I'm not even supposed to be dating at all. - Then you better give the bracelet back. (calming music) - [Molly] Jameson! (Jameson chuckles) - How's ballet, Mollysauce? - Good. We worked on arabesque. You want to see? - Sure. - Hey, Molly? Remember, you can't tell anyone you saw Jameson here. - I know, you've told me like a hundred times. (Mitch chuckles) (Molly speaks in French) - Wow. - Now this is... This is pirouette. Hi, Mason. - Hey. Who's this? - Hey, Jameson. - Mason. You are? - A friend of Mitch's. - I'm showing him my ballet moves. - Well, Mitch is supposed to be watching Molly, so... - He's in his room. - Okay. - Should I continue? - Sure. - So this is pirouette. - [Mason] Mitch, again? What the hell are you doing? - [Mitch] Stop bugging me about it. - [Mason] Give that to me. - [Mitch] Fuck off, Mason! Leave me alone. (mysterious music) - Oh, I'm sorry. - It's okay. - I'm Mason. We met once. - I'm Jameson. I remember. - I didn't know you were here, I thought it was the pastor. - Do you know why I'm here? - I invited you. - Oh. - Hey, Jameson. Can I show you something? - I didn't really think you'd want me here. - No, we do. - Where is everybody? - This is it. Besides the pastor, and his wife, she comes. But yeah, I have a weird family. - What happened to your face? - Oh, it was a bike accident. - Ouch. - Want to know what I did today? - What? - I saw a psychic. - Cool. - She gave me this. It's a crystal. It's for protection. - Did she give it to you before the bike accident? - She said I was on the right path, and then this showed up. - Pastor Rob told me to find verses of comfort. - Sounds like a plan. - I found 7. - I think one will work just fine. - Which one? - Well, which one do you think is right for Mitchel? - Okay. - [Richard] Vanessa! - [Vanessa] A strange kid shows up my doorstep- - Wearing a tie and carrying cupcakes. - I'm just trying to explain- - It seems harmless enough. - We don't know what he's after. - [Richard] I'm not sure I know what you're driving at, Vanessa. - Didn't you ever wonder how Mitchel got into drugs in the first place? - Obviously Molly knows this kid, she's decided he should be here. - What if there are others? Molly, sweetheart? - What's wrong, Mother? - We were just wondering, did you invite any special guests today? - No. - Well, what about your friend Jameson? - I thought Mason invited him. - Molly, sweetie. How do you know Jameson? - I'm not supposed to say. - What does that mean? - Molly, you need to tell us. - He used to come over after school when Mitchel babysat. - That's fine, Molly. We just want to make him feel welcome. (doorbell rings) - Why are they saying those things about Jameson? - They just don't know him yet, dear. - [Vanessa] We're so glad you both could make it. - [Rob] We're so glad to be here. - Pastor Rob and Sheila are here. - Greetings, folks. - Hello, Loretta. Hi, Molly. Rob and I are so sorry for your loss. - As Richard said, Mitchel was just too sensitive and yielding for this world. Isn't that right, honey? - Not in those words. - Poor soul. - Perhaps this world was just too sensitive for him. Any matter, he's with God now. - Amen. - Wow, if it isn't the man of the hour. Hello, Pastor Rob. - Hello, Megan. - Thank you for your condolences, Sheila. - We're happy to be with family at this time, Megan. - Yeah, Sheila. It's a good thing you finally came along, because for years I had targeted Pastor Rob for myself. - Megan! Could you come help me in the kitchen please? - Didn't you just say all the food's already out, Vanessa? - Yes, but I thought you might want a glass of water. And we can get some for our guests. - Actually, Rob, have you had a chance to see Molly's display? - [Rob] Not yet, no. - Let's see, what do we got here? Molly's got everything lined up according to taste, don't you, kiddo? Well, it looks like we got some salty right on the end... Mm! You want to try something salty, Pastor? - I'm fine. - I think he's already gotten a helping, Megan. (Megan laughs) - Oh, Sheila, I didn't know you had it in you. Okay, let's see... We got sour over here, we'll save that for Vanessa. Looks like we got some sweet over here in the middle. Now that seems like something we should try. - Megan, I didn't realize I had a competitor. - Oh, you don't. I'm just looking for a quickie. - Megan. - Maybe I should... I'll get some water. - Goodness. I'm sorry, Rob. - Nonsense, Vanessa. These events are very stressful for the family. - You're kind. - Are you ready for the wake, Molly? - I've written my speech and picked out a Bible verse. You want to hear? - Why don't you surprise me? (Rob chuckles) - Molly, why don't you show me the verse, and we can make it our secret, yeah? (mysterious music) - Hey. - What's wrong? - Nothing, I just really wanted to see you. - Grandpa's sleeping. - I'm sorry. Did you bring me anything? - Are you all right? - No, I'm just feeling like shit. What'd you bring me? - Just a couple of ibuprofen. - That's it? - I don't want to get involved, Mitch. - I'm sorry. Please don't judge me, Jameson. Please. I just really hate being in that house. - What happened? Do your parents know? - No. Just spaces on my case. I'll try and quit, okay? - I'm sorry. (Andrew laughs) - Faggots. - Do you know that guy? - [Andrew] You are dead, Mitchel. - It's weird to be here. - It's best to be around his things. - Is that why you're wearing his shirt? - I guess so, huh? - So this is why you invited me here? - No. I wanted to meet you. - You knew about us? - Of course. - Did Mitch tell you? - He didn't need to. - He told me you're not gay. - I'm not. But that didn't change anything. Do you ever get the feeling that Mitch is trying to reach you? - Since he died? - I think he's here. - I don't really believe in that stuff. - No, look. The instructions say just to keep an open mind and maintain good thoughts. Okay? Sit across from me. - Can I maybe just watch? - No, it takes both of us. (mystical music) All right now. Put your fingers on it like this. What's wrong? - Sorry. - Okay, now just don't force it. All right? Just let the board answer itself, and I'll ask the questions. - Okay. - Okay. For starters... Is anyone there? Is anyone there? - Are you doing that? - Of course not. (mystical music) Are you my brother, Mitchel? - This is freaking me out. - I know, my heart's racing. Okay. - I don't think I can do this. - Yeah, you can. You can, Jameson. It's gonna be okay. Just one last question. Hey, Mitchel. It's Mason. And Jameson. We wanted to know... Are you mad at anyone? - Please, don't ask that. - It's important. Are you mad at anyone? - I don't really like this- - I need to know, Jameson. Mitch. Mitch, please! It's not gonna work without you, Jameson. - I can't. Do you even know how hard it is to even look at you? (dramatic music) - Jameson. Look at me, man. I'm sorry. - I know. I'm sorry I ruined it. (knocking) - [Vanessa] Mason? - Yeah? - Everyone's here and waiting. - Yeah, sorry, we were just talking. - Is that what you're planning to wear? - Yeah. - Mason, I don't think that's appropriate. - It's to honor him. - You know what? Forget it. You look fine. We're about to start. - Are you good? - [Vanessa] I don't know why those two boys are hiding. Now, Rob, what can I get to drink? - [Megan] Vanessa, I already asked. - [Vanessa] Well, I don't see glasses in their hands. - Oh, Mitchel, hello. - [Rob] That's Mason. - Oh. Mason, Mason, I am so sorry. - [Mason] No, it's okay. - [Sheila] No, really, that's just unacceptable. - [Mason] It happens a lot. Jameson, this is Pastor Rob and Sheila. - [Jameson] Hello. - Excuse me? Can everyone gather in the next room? I've been waiting to start the wake. - [Loretta] I guess we're needed. - Does everyone have a candle? I wanted white, but Mason got green. Okay, first of all, I want to thank Pastor Rob for allowing me to conduct the wake today. The verse I will be reading is from Matthew, chapter 11, verses 28-29. "Jesus said, come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you shall find rest unto your souls." - Amen. - Wonderful choice of verse, Molly. - Thank you. Now, let's begin the remembrances. You have to light your candle and then share your memory about Mitchel. Who wants to go? - I can say something. - Light your candle, Grandmother. - Okay. I don't think anyone can argue that Mitchel was a compassionate soul. As a young child, he started volunteering for the Special Olympics every summer when he could've been playing baseball or video games. I think we can all learn something from that. So, thank you for being an example to us all, Mitchel. - Okay, I'll go. Oh. Mitchel always believed in me. When I was young, he taught me how to draw. He also made me these cranes, which I will always cherish. When he babysat me after school, he and Jameson treated me like a friend. I know he'll be waiting for me in heaven. I love you, Mitchel. - That was very sweet, Molly. I guess I'll go next. I don't have a long speech prepared. I just wanted to remember how- - Mother, candle! - Sorry. I just wanted to remember how creative Mitchel was. He was always drawing or painting or something. I mean, Molly showed us these paper cranes he made. I certainly never learned how to do anything like that. I think he actually even taught himself how to weave. He had this leather bracelet that he always wore. But now I guess it was buried with him. - Forgive me for interrupting, Mrs. Christensen, but actually I made that bracelet. - Oh, I didn't know. Sorry. Well, that's what I wanted to say. - Great, Mother. Mason, your turn. - I'll pass. - You should honor your brother, son. - I don't have anything to add, Dad. - Maybe you can think about it, Mason. Um, Jameson! - Um, okay. I was a little surprised to receive an invitation. Mason said I'm welcome here today. I'm grateful. I only knew Mitch for a year, but he was the best thing in my world. I moved here two years ago to live with my grandfather after my parents passed away. It was hard. And lonely. But after I met Mitch, I don't know... When we were together, I felt whole. I didn't think anyone could ever have that affect on me. - Take a break if you need to, son. - No, I'm okay. I may not have known him as long as all of you, but... I loved him. - Jameson, we know you're hurting very much. Let's just please be careful. - We know Mitchel was a good friend to you. - [Vanessa] Okay. - Good friend? Mitchel was his boyfriend! - [Vanessa] Molly, why would you say that? - I saw them kissing! - Okay, Molly... You shouldn't talk about things unless you're sure you know what you're talking about. - I'm sure! - Zip it, Molly. Jameson, she doesn't know what she's saying. - Sorry, did I- - Jameson, if I may, I think we've gotten a little off track here. This isn't the place to confess our sins. We're all here to honor Mitchel. Isn't that right, Molly? So maybe we can just focus on that, and continue with the remembrances. - Good idea. Who would like to go next? - Wait a second, you guys all just cut off Jameson. - It's okay, Mason. - Everyone, I've got a remembrance to share. It's from the nativity of the- - No, it's not okay. I didn't even know Mitchel had anyone in his life. You seem lovely, and it's really nice to meet you. - Thank you. - Mason's right, you just cut him off. - I'm sorry, you're right, you're right. I'm sorry, Jameson. Please, please. What would you like to say? - I'm finished. - None of us knew what was going on in Mitchel's life, not really. Maybe Jameson did. - Okay, Megan, let's not start. - Then help me understand, Grandma, why didn't any of us get him help? - [Vanessa] We would have if we had known. - How could you possibly not... It's all of our faults that this happened. - That's a terrible thing to say. - [Richard] Megan, he hid the pills from us. - It was an accidental overdose, you know that. Now, can we just please get back to the remembrances? - I'm sorry, does anyone really believe that? - [Loretta] Megan, honey. - He tried to reach me that night. Didn't you ever wonder why I was here? He called me. - Oh, no. Oh, no, Megan. - [Megan] Vanessa! - [Mitch] Meg, where are you? I'm in trouble, God, I miss you so much. God, I wish you hadn't moved to the city. I really messed up and I need you. God, just please call me back, I don't know what I might do. - Oh... Meg. - There's another one. - Megan. Show some respect. - [Mitch] Hey, it's me again. Yeah, you could ignore that last message, I'm better now. I'm just gonna go to sleep. I love you, Megan. - That... Doesn't prove anything. - Dad! - There's been a shock. Obviously there's still a lot of healing to do around Mitchel's passing. If I can give my humble opinion, I think we should all take a step back and take a breath before we say anything we might regret. - Thank you, Pastor. - Loretta, of course I'm happy to stay and help, but I think maybe this is a private family matter. - I think you're probably right. - Of course, Rob and I are available to you, any of you, whenever. - Thank you, Sheila. I'll show you both out. - Mother! What's going on? - Shh, shh, shh, shh. Your sister thinks that Mitch took his own life. - Why? - She's mistaken. The medical examiner said that it was an accident, but now our pastor thinks that his soul is burning in hell. - Molly, it's also possible the coroner told us what we wanted to hear. - Why would you want to pollute a child with that? - Because it's true. Isn't that a Christian virtue you want her to understand? - Megan, you're drunk. And you're making a fool out of yourself. This is a sacred event. How dare you show up here and do something so selfish and impertinent. Yes, we knew he was having a hard time, and we did what we could to... So just stop looking for someone to blame. - Too far out of hand, please let- - Will everyone please stop trying to shut me up? She needs to hear this. You left, Megan. - I was not the one responsible for him. - Won't you just let him rest in peace? - I just want to understand what happened. - We know what happened! And I have been trying to hold this family together. Now, I don't know if you've noticed your father and your sister, but do they look normal to you? And Mason is so depressed that he won't even speak to us. - I don't want to talk to you, Vanessa, because you won't talk about anything fucking real. - Mason! - What, Mason? What won't we talk about? - You don't want anyone to be fucking sad. God, even when Mitch was alive, you wouldn't even let us talk about our dead mother! Do you really think he would be dead if she was still here? - Why would you say that, Mason? I hate you! I hate you, Megan! You both ruined everything! - Thank you everyone for having me. - [Loretta] That poor kid. - You shouldn't have kept those messages away from us, Meg. - Mason, Mason, where are you going? - [Loretta] leave him be, Vanessa. - Jameson! - I really need to clear out. - Look, my parents suck. - No reason for you to say that. - I really need to talk to you. - You could've told your parents I was coming. - [Mason] Screw them! - Don't you think that was kinda messed up? - Look, I didn't want them to have a say in it. - I'm talking about me, dude. That was a messed up thing to do to me. I'm so screwed in the head right now. And your sister's message. Do you really think- - No, dude, I think he was just trying to get rid of the pain. - It's just hard to take in. Anyway, it shouldn't matter. He broke up with me. - What? - The day, or at least I think it was, the day it happened. So maybe I don't really deserve to be here. - I didn't know. I'm sorry. - No one bothered to reach out to me. I thought Mitch was just trying to blow me off afterwards. I texted, I called, nothing. I was wrecked. Finally, I just gave up, figured he didn't want anything to do with me. Then I found out in the stupidest way. I was in biology class sneaking on my phone when the tea... Somebody had posted it on Facebook. It was like everything just froze. The teacher was yelling at me, telling me to put my phone down, I couldn't move my arm. My whole body went numb. The teacher was staring at me, everyone was asking me if I was okay or something. I couldn't say anything. Then she looked at me like I was dying or something. (Jameson sobs) Then I can't remember. My whole head went blank. Dark. - I'm sorry I didn't reach out to you sooner. - Why did he push me away? Maybe I could've helped him. - Hey, Jameson. I think I need to show you something. - We're not gonna do the Ouija board again, are we? - You miss your brother, don't you, Mollypop? - It's Molly. - Sorry. I miss him too. - How come we're not supposed to talk about him? - You are supposed to talk about him, sweetheart. - No, we're not! - We did today, didn't we? - That was terrible! - I guess it was. - I hate it when they yell at each other. - Me too, kiddo. - Mitchel wouldn't like it. - I think you're right. - What do you think Jesus would do? - I think Jesus would forgive and ask for forgiveness. - Before the sun goes down, right? - That's right. - Do you think I would make a good priest? (Loretta chuckles) - You would make a great priest. - The sun's going down. - You're right. - I just wanted to do something nice for Mitchel. - I know you did. - But no one ever listens to me. - No one ever listens to me either, sweetie. (ominous music) (cell phone buzzes) - Sorry, I didn't know you were in here. - It is my room. - I was just here to get my luggage, I'm leaving now. Dad, are you okay? I really didn't mean for it to escalate like that, I just thought you had a right to know. - Mitchel... Mitchel was always a mystery to me. And hell, you all were, but Mitchel, Mitchel in particular, he was... He was always so guarded, so vulnerable. Even when he was little. I know I was tough on him, I just didn't want him to be a victim. And that made it worse, that made him even more vulnerable. I think I hated him for that. - You didn't hate Mitch, Dad. - Then now, I find out some kid I've never even met, he knew my own son better than I did. You know... They were mine. The pills that he used. So I'm just sitting here trying to find exactly where I failed as a father. - I love you. And Mitch loved you. Do you want me to stay? - No, you should go. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Yeah, I'll be fine. - Grandma, I know that was rough. - If what you say is true, then Mitch has a very big problem in the afterlife. You don't want that, do you? - Of course not. - So let it be an accident. - Grandma. - Maybe it's best for everyone's sake if you wait a while before coming back to visit. - Isn't that why everyone's already pissed at me? Maybe you're right. You be good, Mollycakes. - I will. - You come see me some time in the city, okay? We'll eat at Umami. - Are we going to have dinner tonight? - [Loretta] You hungry? - A little. - Well, you don't need to worry about that. - I don't think anyone's preparing it. - How come you let Megan call you Mollycakes and Jameson call you Mollysauce, but you won't let me call you Mollypop? - Because Jameson's my friend! - I can't be your friend? - You're my grandmother. - What about Megan? - That's different. - I miss the way you and Mitch used to play. - Why? - Because, you two were goofy together. - How? - The way kids should be. You know, I still want to be a kid. - You can't be a kid! - Oh, well, we'll see about that! Okay, you're hungry? You want someone to prepare dinner? How about we do it? - That's the reception food! - We'll make a stew. Start with a little salty, and now we add some bitter. Just gonna stand there staring, or come help me? What else? What other tastes we got? - Um, sweet. - [Loretta] Put them in there. - But that won't taste- - Dump them in there! I'm making a stew. - Oh, we're missing sour! - Mm! And don't forget umami. Mm! Your turn to stir. Oh, very good. - It's spilling. - That's okay, you're the chef. Okay. I think it's ready. - Gross. - How do you know until you've tried? - It's okay. - Mm! Wonderful! (Molly laughs) - I give up. - We're just letting off a little steam. - Sorry, Mother. - I thought you might be hungry. - I'm okay. - You two were good to Mitchel. Better than I was. - That's not true, Mother! - You'll see him again one day, Molly. (Megan panting) (ominous music) - Was there a funeral? - Yeah. It was just teachers and family and stuff. - [Jameson] Cancer, right? Mitch told me. - Yeah. - How old were you? - I was four. - My parents are gone too. Car accident. - I'm sorry. - Mitch told me you pretended to be him after the funeral. And you drew a picture on the wall. - Yeah, I wanted him to get the credit. (unnerving music) I think I might be responsible. That day... He didn't just reach out to Megan, he came to me too. But I was so pissed off at him. God, I yelled at him. I said things and I pushed him away, and then he was fucking gone. Today some guys beat the shit out of me for something Mitch did, and my dad told everyone that it was a bike accident. That's what we do in my family. But the thing is, I wanted it. I wanted it so bad, I swung first, and they beat the fucking shit out of me. But it was perfect. Everything turned to slow motion, and I could taste the blood filling up in my mouth, and then I remember thinking that this is gonna be how I'm gonna die. This is how I'm gonna reach Mitch. But then they just fucking left me there. I laid there wishing that they'd just fucking come back and finish it, but they didn't. I'm never gonna be able to reach him, Jameson. Never gonna be able to reach him. (Mason sobs) I'm not gonna be able to reach him, man! (dramatic music) (cell phone buzzes) - Grandpa. - Do you need to go? - No, not yet. Hey. I want you to have this. - Are you sure? - Yeah, I'm sure. - Who's this? Megan? - Mason? - Who's that? - It's my friend, Thomas. He's cool. Hi, Jameson. - Hey. - So, I guess everyone's mad at me again. Seems to be about the only thing I'm good at these days. - Well, someone had to speak up. - I could really use a hug. - I think we're gonna need some candles. - I'll call Grandma. - No, text her. She's really proud of her texting abilities. (Megan chuckles) - [Megan] Did you guys walk here? - Yeah. - A long one. - It took us like an hour. - It was good. - Hey, Mollycakes. - Do you want one of these? - Molly, I know your wake didn't go so good, and I know that was partially my fault, and I just wanted to tell you that I'm really sorry. - What are you doing? - Come here. - How you doin', Jameson? - Still crying. - May I hug you? (calming music) You should go join them. - Aren't you gonna come? - I've made my peace. You go. (somber music) - [Mason] The dream is always the same. We are young, and happy, and fearless. Sometimes we rule the world together, sometimes we make mistakes. Sometimes we hate each other, and sometimes we make good. Sometimes I'm lost and I wander without aim. And that's when I found the way to reach you, is to stop trying. (dramatic music)
