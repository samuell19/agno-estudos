♪♪ [wind whistling] [Rachel] There's a summer in every life when one door closes and another opens, leading you to a place you'd only dimly imagined. That summer for me happened a few years ago in my hometown, Sandy Bottom, Wisconsin. And before it was over, my family and our little town would be changed forever. It all started simply enough, as summers do, with the crack of dawn. [violinist playing] Breakfast is almost ready. You're sounding better, but watch your "A", it's flat. [Rachel] Leave it to Mother, she could praise you, shame you, and feed you in the same breath. [classical music playing] -How's Mahler this morning? -Shh-shh! Well, the woodwinds need a little work, but, uh... huh... -Oh! -[chuckles] Hey, do I smell bacon? You smell it all right, but that's all you're going to do. It's for Rachel. You're having oatmeal. Oh, just a slice? Well, you know your cholesterol level. Besides, what good is being married to the best-looking man in town if he's six feet under? [humming] I'm ready to pack my bags and leave this town. I mean it this time, Norman! This whole Ramsey Building fiasco is driving me nuts. It's a new low in small town small-mindedness. General's at her post. I mean it this time. That Mayor Broadbutt better think twice if he thinks he's going to railroad this town with another one of his mindless schemes. It's Broadbent, Mom, not Broadbutt. Have you seen him lately? He wants to take a magnificent building, the only magnificent building within 50 miles, and raze it so that he could put up a gas station, a video store, and now, the latest: a pizza parlor. And there's a town council meeting tonight at 6:00. I think we should all be there. We are proud of you for fighting the good fight... but one battle at a time. Last week you blew a gasket because the Board of Ed dropped Spanish from the high-school curriculum. Yeah, they were wrong to do it; it's xenophobic. But we're in Wisconsin. Who needs Spanish? [Ingrid] Do you see? You go out there... and you shake that tree, my love. [giggles] I'm late for a meeting at the dairy, and you're late for school. Well, I'm going to win the battle this time, Norman. I really am. I have no doubt. Bye, hon. Rachel, your knapsack! -Bye. -Bye, Mom. Phoebe Hanson? Coach says we've got a shot at the regionals. Can't you see us going all the way to Green Bay Championship this summer? I can see you doing just about anything. So, what did you decide? Come on, try out. We'd have such a blast playing together. Well, you know, I'd probably just embarrass you. -Hey, Carol. -Hey, Carol. -Hey! -Hi, Rachel. Hi. Hey, you guys, let's show Rachel our new cheer. Okay. You know O'Connel's Jewelers is sponsoring the team this year, well, uh... Valerie and I came up with this. -Okay. -Okay. ♪ We're O'Connel's And we're no fools! ♪ ♪ We got the brains And we got the jewels! ♪ ♪ We got the diamonds We got the rubies! ♪ ♪ All you got is a pair Of boobies! ♪ [all laughing] -Isn't she great, Rachel? -The best. [Jenny] Come on, guys, let's go make sure our basketball lockers are together. Okay. Oh, uh... see you later, huh? [Rachel] Yeah, later. [bell ringing] All right, everyone. The assignment was to imagine that you're something familiar in your house, like a... a chair, or a plate, or a picture, and to tell your story. Who would like to go first? Was this for today? Rachel Green, why don't you start us off? "What the piano knew." I'm a piano, nine feet long, brown, though not as shiny as I once was, but still grand. My story begins in 1970. A young man named Norman Green at the university would walk past the music building every morning on his way to class. The music pouring out the open window made him feel happy. But the sound of one piano in particular attracted him. It was the playing of Ingrid Mueller. [playing ballad] When the beautiful pianist with the long red hair gave her senior recital, Norman planted himself right in the front row. But Ingrid's father August was afraid Norman was not cultivated enough for his daughter. When they announced their engagement, he gave them a piano so big and wonderful, they would never be able to put music behind them. And when they moved to Sandy Bottom with their baby daughter, I took my place in their dining room. I hear everything in this house. But a piano keeps its secrets and doesn't go telling stories until it's asked. Then I become the voice of all the sadness and joy inside her. The end. Well, thank you, Rachel. All right, who's next? Todd Gustaffson. [sighs] I am the Gustaffson's toaster oven. I have two speeds: hot and very hot. [choir singing off-key] Stop! Stop, stop, stop, stop. It's terrible. Terrible! Mr. Geckle, you are nowhere near that B-flat. Listen. -[playing B-flat] -[off-key] ♪ A-a-a ♪ A-a-a... Hmmm? I love that high part, sounds just like birds. All right. Look, I know it's a stretch, but if we just give it our all... It's such beautiful music, so come on, let's do it. What was wrong with "Rock of Ages" or "A Mighty Fortress is Our God"? Mrs. Granlund, we've been through this. Now, I agreed to take this job if we could expand our repertoire, but you have been kicking and screaming all the way there. Not me, Mrs. Green. I-I think it's wonderful! I know. Let's just break for today, okay? But please, please, please, review the Harbison at home. And then let's come back Friday with a whole new outlook, okay? [sighs] Challenging rehearsal, Ingrid? Well, I'm afraid so, Jim. They just weren't interested in Harbison today. Well, I warned you about this. The, uh... members of Bethesda don't cotton readily to change. Well, I know that, Jim. And I love the old hymns, and I haven't forgotten them. But there is other music, rich and beautiful and complicated music that people should hear. Maybe, in the concert hall. Well, you yourself said that this was a "hall of God," so what better place for such glorious music? You're a clever woman, Ingrid. Maybe a bit too clever. Well, when they put a ceiling on intelligence, I'm sure you'll let me know, Jim. See you on Friday. My best to Miriam. Oh, how beautiful! The last of my peonies. [Delia] Oh, aren't you sweet. Come in, come in, dear friend. Oh, thank you. Well... the Reverend Sykes again? Hm, how can you tell? -You're puffing like a pugilist. -Ah, this town! Nothing but teeny little minds and great big lawnmowers. Oh, it's not that bad. They made you choir director, and that reflects taste. You and I both know it was your suggestion, after you slipped on the ice in front of the church, that got me the job. That was a clever moment. [both chuckle] "Take an opening," Harry always used to say. Any opening. Still, they're very lucky to have you. Oh, I see that your, uh... your old college friend Phoebe Hanson is in the newspapers again today. Singing in Vienna now. Yep... She's living a wonderful life. Oh, to be sure. Oh, but a new city every month. No family, no roots. What kind of life must that be? Just trying to remind you that all that glitters isn't gold. You traded up, Ingrid. And you should never regret that choice. [Ingrid] I don't. I just wonder sometimes what it would be like to be... part of something really important. To feel like you really fit in. Mmm... in just the right place, with people who really appreciated you. I never noticed that before. It's Sandy Bottom. Mm-hmm. From the old Taylor place on the hill. I brought it down from the guest bedroom today. Harry painted it years ago, when he was in one of his moods. He made the town look beautiful. And you know what a curmudgeon he was. He's the only person I know who railed harder than you against small town thinking. But in his heart, he really loved this place. It was in every brush stroke. There's nothing wrong in wondering what your life might have been, Ingrid. But don't overlook what you hold in your hands. -What's that? -Gazpacho. It's very healthy. You'll love it. And hurry up because we've gotta be at the meeting in an hour. So, what's happening at the world's greatest dairy? Well, I have some news. I've made a decision about this year's Dairy Days concert. You know, in the past, we've done, uh... oh, marching bands, and oom-pah bands until we're blue in the face. So I got to thinking that Sandy Bottom is ready for something... grander. Such as? Such as... a real classical concert, using the best musicians from all over the county. Classical, like Mozart classical? -Exactly. -[Ingrid] Um... could you get the ice pack, Rachel? 'Cause I think your father must be burning up. I'm serious. Now why shouldn't this town experience something sophisticated for once? Right? A little high art couldn't hurt. Classical music in Sandy Bottom? Norman, it's an oxymoron! They would laugh you right out of the bandshell. Well, I'm surprised to hear that coming from you, Ingrid, the last defender of the muse. Well, I personally would love it, but you know, I would be just about the only one. Well... I think it's a great idea. Maybe. All right, so I've got two takers. Now, come Labor Day, the whole town will be glad I thought of it. Hey, you just wait and see. [mayor] The simple fact is that the Ramsey Building has to come down... to make way for these valuable and needed services for the community. Yeah, like pizza. Now, I know I'm not alone... when I say that this idea of turning the Ramsey into some kind of art complex is just a hairbrained scheme... to get the taxpayers to fund a private playground for the three or four people in town who like to listen to this screechy-scratchy music and look at pieces of junk that somebody stuck up on the wall and called art. [man] Hear, hear! I just wish the whiners and the naysayers and the oh so "chick" radical element who expect government to build their fantasy world would just all go away and let decent, hardworking people enjoy the wonderful town that Sandy Bottom is. [loud cheers] All right, all right. We haven't lost our civility, have we? Let's have order here. Ingrid, uh... Mrs. Green. Thank you, Fred. Um, I know the mayor and, and plenty of others here would probably like to see nothing better than my backside going to Minneapolis. [crowd chuckles] But I'll be darned if I'm going to let this very narrow view of public good stand without a fight. Now I think that this town needs to preserve what little it possesses in the way of history. And the Ramsey Building is a link between who we've been and where we're going. [scattered applause] And you speak for this town, Mrs. Green? [Ingrid] Well, maybe, maybe not. Now I'm not saying that the Ramsey Building has to be an art center. There are probably plenty of other uses, things we haven't thought of yet. I'm just saying, let's not swing the wrecking ball before we've thought about it, because our children might regret it in the morning. Oh, here we go again. Well, if it's a fight you want, it's a fight you'll get, Mrs. Green. Well, Mayor, there's nothing I'd like better. So may the best man win. [laughter and applause] [Rachel] So it had begun, my mother's quest to save a piece of Sandy Bottom history. [Ingrid] ...the first Swedish settlers. Look at this hand-carved... [Rachel] She organized the troops at the Ramsey Building and launched a campaign to win over all the doubting Thomases in our town. These are hand-hewn white pine boards... [Rachel] My father was becoming the impresario of northern Wisconsin, booking a conductor and producing what he had hoped would be the high-water mark of Sandy Bottom's dubious musical history. I was just hoping to survive both of their schemes with a shred of personal dignity. So tell me honestly, on a scale of like 1 to 10... how weird is my mom? Like a 9? No, maybe a 6. A 6 or a 7. [sighs] But I still like her. -You do? -She's cool. My dad thinks she's the smartest person in town. Hey, Carol, Ginny's having a slumber party for the team tomorrow. Can you come? -Um, what about Rachel? -Well... it's Ginny's party, and she's just invited the team. I don't want to come without her. Hey, if it's for team members, it's for team members. -You sure? -Sure I'm sure. -Okay, then count me in. -Great, later on. Thanks for taking a stand. What do you mean? You said you didn't care. Look, I don't, okay? You have your new friends and you don't have time for your old one. Well, that's not fair. Look, you're busy with baseball. And you've got violin. So we like different things. So what? And different people. Okay, we're different. Have we settled that? I've got to get to class. [Rachel] "Different" in Sandy Bottom could make you a very lonely person. Terrific... terrific! Um... no, I'll work out the details with your representatives. Yeah. I look forward to meeting you. Yeah... Yeah. See you in a few weeks. Bye. Wow. How is my gorgeous daughter? Why so glum, huh? It's nothing. You're pretty chipper. Well, you are looking at the man who just signed the talented and brash... young Adam Cornish... to conduct the Dairy Days Orchestra. Adam Cornish from Boston? The very same. Wow! I'm impressed. Even your mother might be won over by this news, huh? Hmm. -Guess what. -What? I want you... in the violin section. Me? Yeah. I know you can do it, and you're going to get paid, honey. I mean, it's not much. Yeah. It's like the life of a real musician. You know, I, uh... I, uh... I think I've done enough work for one day. All right? You want to... you want to take a walk with me in the meadow? Yeah. Okay. Good. Take a deep breath. This is what green smells like. Is everything all right with you? You don't seem quite yourself these days. I don't know what myself is supposed to be. I know that... I don't fit in very well. You know what kids used to call me when I was 14? Lefty. But you're right-handed. Mmm, well, I'm afraid you inherited the, uh... "no good at sports" gene. [sighs] Boy, kids can be so cruel sometimes, you know? How did you stand it? [sighs] Well, I spent a lot of time alone, tramping in the fields, the woods. And then I started noticing things. Subtle, really beautiful things, that I'm sure the kids in town were missing. Like, um... like how a milkweed grows, and, uh... the special care a... a duck takes in building its nest. And that got me interested in science, and after a while, uh... I stopped feeling lonely. And I started to feel like I was a part of... the wonders that were happening all around me. Does that make any sense? I love you, Dad. You know, there is no one right way to grow up. You're doing it Rachel Green's way. And it's lovely to watch. [Rachel] With school out and Carol disappearing into the world of girl's baseball, I tried making other friends. But a good dose of Norman and Ingrid's eccentric side was generally enough to guarantee my solitary existence. [Ingrid] And if the Mayor and his cohorts think they'll prevail, they've got another thing coming... Who's that? Because those of us with a conscience cannot help but be outraged... -My mother. -Who's she talking to? No one. Um... she's formulating. She... writes letters. Hey, is that you, Rachel? Listen, tell me what you think of this. -M-Mom, not now, okay? -Mr. Mayor... Hi. Who's your new friend? This is Melanie. We're going to go in the back. [Ingrid] Okay, sweetie. Nice to meet you. And since when did videos replace reading... Since when... when did videos replace reading? [Beethoven's Ninth Symphony plays] Hey, girls. Have you ever heard anything so magnificent, huh? W-wait, w-wait, here come the horns... Yeah... Come on, give it to me! ["Ode to Joy" playing] [Rachel] There was always Saturday, the day reserved for my violin lesson at Mr. Amidore's music school in Oshkosh. It was a long drive, but I never minded, because in those days, Mr. Amidore's was the only place where I felt sort of normal. [indistinct chatter] Ahh... Here's my Rachella and Mrs. Green. Delightful to see you. [Ingrid] Hello, Mr. Amidore. I've made brownies, Rachella. -Ooh! -Yes! -You have one too, Mrs. Green. -[Ingrid] Thank you, Mrs. Amidore. -Oh! -These, these look great. Oh, you have. Come, come. That's it. Oh, musicians... they're all skin and bone. All right, time to tune up. Here are the brochures from Interlochen. I will not say a word to Rachel. I'll leave that up to you. But I urge you to consider it. Now I warn you: the requirements are strict, and the auditions can be grueling. Is she really good enough? You know she is. [playing "Meditation from Thais"] No, no, no! What are you doing? You're not concentrating. The violin makes music because it sits just above the heart. But how can you connect the two unless you feel the music? Again. Thank you. A student like you makes up for all the others. I'll speak with your mother a moment. Hey. Hi. Was he a bear? No more than usual. He bit my head off earlier. But you're his favorite. Probably he couldn't find much to yell at. I hear your dad's putting together an orchestra for Dairy Days? I got a call from a booking agent. They're paying and everything. I'm going to be playing too, and he's getting Adam Cornish to conduct. That's fantastic! I know, he's so talented. No... I mean, that you'll be playing, too. Well... Uh... see... see you next Saturday? Okay. Interlochen Arts Academy. That's a million miles away. It's Michigan, Norman. And she would have to live there during the school year. No way! I don't want her leaving home. What's wrong with Mr. Amidore? Well, he can only take her so far. He said so himself. I mean, he is the one who suggested Interlochen. Well, she's a baby, she belongs here in Sandy Bottom. She's 14, Norman, and she's already showing signs of having the talent "blanded" out of her. -Blanded? -Yeah! You see how she is. She tries to please everyone, she's trying to please the wrong people. At Interlochen, she would be exposed to a whole world of music, and art, and... things you just... you can't get here. That world exists in... in New York, or Chicago at least. Not Sandy Bottom. Yeah, this place has a sense of community. You can't get that in a big city. All you get is... arrogance. A herd of cows has a sense of community, Norman. Last time I looked, those cows did pretty well by this family. Do you want her to... look back and... and wonder what she might have become because we didn't at least offer her a chance? Like I took your chance away. I chose. And I chose pretty damn well. Well... maybe we could write them. [gasps] [chuckles] Oh... [sighs] [Rachel] By the next morning, the letter was posted. By noon, Mother had another crisis on her hands. [choir singing fugue] Is something wrong, Mrs. Granlund? Mrs. Green, pardon me for being forward, but I don't think this music belongs in the Lutheran Church. It may be nice in Carnegie Hall with professionals, but it doesn't do anything for me. Either you're in the wrong place, or I am. Well, Mrs. Granlund, I have no intention of leaving. Very well. Coming, Cora? Please, don't do this. You'll be hearing from Reverend Sykes. [Rachel] There must have been something in the air that day, because the hurt simmering between Carol and me boiled into a row, too. I said awful things, she said awful things. It was clear to me that I just didn't fit into her world anymore. I'd be alone forever now. [sniffling] [violin playing "Ave Maria"] [Norman] Anyone home? Up here, Norman. [sighs] Norman? What... what's wrong? Adam Cornish jumped ship on us. [gasps] He's history, got a better offer. The booking agent tried to get a replacement, but no one's available, so he suggested... that we bag the concert. Oh, no! Norman! Oh, I'm so sorry. [Rachel] Me too, Daddy. So I got to thinking, that punk is not going to ruin our Dairy Days. You know? If that turkey thinks he's the only conductor in Wisconsin, well, then I say... ha! He thinks he's such a genius that he can cancel on a whim. I say, "Well, go ahead, Mr. Big Shot, 'cause... I'll conduct them myself." Norman, you've never conducted an orchestra. Yeah, well... not yet, maybe. I mean, there was a time when Leonard Bernstein hadn't conducted an orchestra, so what did he do? He got up... and he conducted one. You see what I'm saying? See? W-what's the big mystery about it? Daddy, you're not Leonard Bernstein. And he wasn't Norman Green. I know music. I love it, I can read music. What is a conductor? He's not a musician, a musician plays. A conductor pulls everyone together and, and... guides everyone in the same direction. See? I can do that. Oh, Lord! Well... it's a done deal. All we've got to do is go around town and change all the posters. Let me see those! Ha-ha. Sandy Bottom hasn't heard the last from this family. [chorus singing Beethoven's "Ode to Joy"] ["Ode to Joy" continues] [cow moos] Hello? [Delia] Oh, in the living room, dear. Oh, Dr. Winters, is everything all right? [Delia] Rachel too! Come on, give me a kiss. Oh, no, everything's just fine. Not to worry. For now, but her angina's back, and it's getting worse. You've got to get more rest, Delia. Stop exerting yourself. Nonsense! I may not have many more gardens left in me, and I still have to plant my bulbs. Well, Rachel and I can do that for you. [Dr. Winters] Ah, she's impossible. Sam, I am not a fool. At my age, I am not buying new wine, and I'm not planting young trees, but I must have my flowers! What are you going to do with a woman like this? Just stay out of her way! I'll be back Friday. I'll have the pharmacy drop your prescription by. Thank you, Sam. -Ladies. -Thank you, Doctor. Hey... I'm worried about you. Haven't you enough on your plate already? Oh... I hear the pews are quaking over at Bethesda. Well, I'm waiting for the shoe to drop. Is it so awful to try to get people to broaden their horizons? Of course not, honey. This would never happen in Minneapolis. Thoreau wrote his best works in a town one-tenth the size of Sandy Bottom. Mmm, but they also put him in jail. Oh... [chuckles] Oh, you... Can I ask you something? Are you and Daddy happy? I mean, are you glad you married each other? Of course we are. Well... is there some kind of problem with me? I found the letter from Interlochen. It was opened. Sweetie, Interlochen is a school for kids in the arts. It's got nothing to do with you being a problem and nothing to do with Daddy and me. We were going to tell you... as soon as we knew that we could afford it. And then we would consider it together and we would make a choice. I think they could bring out your talent there and help you to develop it. Maybe I don't have that much to develop. [sighs] Spoken like a true artist. -Interlochen. -Mm-hmm. Higher, higher! Attack stronger. Attack stronger! That's enough for now. I'm really trying, Mr. Amidore. I know. This is new territory. It's always painful. Hi! Hey, there's my women. Hey, come here. Look. I've picked out the music for the concert, um... Ives' "Variations on America," and... Mozart's A-major piano concerto. Wow! Uh... that's brave, Norman. Brave to the point of insanity. This is... this is really challenging material. Who exactly are you going to get to play the piano in the Mozart? Me? No. No, no, no, no, no, no... No. No! Of course you! You're the best pianist in a country mile. And if I'm not mistaken, this was your graduation recital piece, right? Now you should sail through this. Come on, Mom. I think it's a great idea! No, you are... you are crazy, both of you! Honestly, I-I haven't played for an audience, you know, in 15 years. No, really, no. Half this town, you know, wants my head already and they would just be holding their breath for my first mistake. -But, Ingrid, I'm telling you... -No, really. Seriously, they would howl me off the stage before you ever even raised your baton. Hey, hey. Let them howl. We'll face them together. [sighs, stammers] This... is... No, no. Really, really, I'm flattered. Really I am, but, but, uh... I won't be the one to lead you to the slaughter. So you have to find somebody else to do that. So... I don't want to hear about it from either one of you. Okay? That's that. [exhales] Your mother... Frankly, Ingrid... your choice of music and your treatment of the choir members is causing, um... deep discomfort. But even so, we pulled off the Bach last month. You remember? You yourself said that you found it moving. Well, yes. But the church is here to welcome people, not to make them feel inferior. Well, the church can be as welcoming as it likes, but, you know, some people just can't sing worth beans. The ill feeling has gone well beyond the choir loft. And how do you expect people to keep their minds on spiritual matters during those explosive, almost heathen organ preludes you play? Heathen? Eugene, that's ridiculous. Let me put it more simply: Mrs. Granlund is not a person who I want to see going over to the Methodists. Well, I suggest that Mrs. Green submit all of her music to the Worship Committee for approval beforehand. Seems reasonable to me, Ingrid. Oh, that'd be fine with me. As long as I get to edit your sermons. All right, Mrs. Green, we have a proposition for you. Now, you've complained for years about this little house. There's no room to spread out, uh... no room for grandchildren... if and when we have them. [sigh] All that can change because, honey, the old Taylor house is up for sale. This could be the home of your dreams right here, in Sandy Bottom. Honey, what's wrong? Ingrid? If it weren't for you and Rachel, I'd leave here this minute! For 14 years, I've tried to fit in here, tried to... matter to people in this mud puddle! But it's no use! [sobbing] What happened? They fired me! Oh... [sobbing] It's finally out in the open, they... they just don't feel that I belong, and I can't disagree anymore! [Rachel] My father was extra sweet to her that night. And though the storm over Mother's firing at Bethesda continued to rumble in our household, she wasn't down for long. Without the choir to distract her, she was on an all-out mission to save the Ramsey Building. In her heart, she thought if she failed, she'd have to leave Sandy Bottom once and for all. [indistinct chatter, orchestra tuning up] Hey, Rachel. Hi, Scott! -So this is it, huh? -Yeah, I guess so. Well, good luck to all of us, right? Yeah. I've got to go tune up. See you, okay? [Klonowski] Violins, spread out! You look like overstuffed sardines! You are? Rachel Green. Oh, the conductor's daughter. Well, we shall see, um... Don't mind Klonowski. His bark is worse than his bite. I'm Evelyn Carlson. Welcome to the Funny Farm. I don't know your father's work, um... Where has he conducted? Oh... you know, here and there. Mostly, um... local things. Good afternoon! I'm Norman Green. And, uh... let's start with the Ives. We, uh... We need an "A". Of course. Please. [Klonowski] A question for oboes, Maestro. In measure 51, uh, what are our notes? There may be a mistake in the part. Uh... No, they seem right to me. But, um... Let's see what happens when we get there. [Klonowski] Okay. All right, let's, uh, let's take her for a test run, shall we? From the top. Little slower tempo at first. One, two, three, one, two... Fifteen minutes, people. Then right back. Your father is doing fine. Ah, he's a little bumpy in spots, but at least he's got music sense. Do you really think so? Oh, believe me, if he didn't, he'd be dead already. [chuckles] We're an unforgiving lot. And I'm going for coffee. -Hey, Rachel. -Hi, Scott. Violins sound good. You especially. -You can't hear me! -No, I can. I know your sound. It's... it's warmer than the rest. I was wondering if... maybe you wanted to go out sometime? [Norman] Hey! [Ingrid] Ah! Well, no visible wounds! Oh, it was great. You should've seen Dad. He was amazing. Really? And you made it through the fast part okay? Ah, some of it was wretched. But... we ended at the same time. Well, I'll be darned. Yeah, I tried to give them a clear downbeat, and they took it from there. Sometimes you have to let go of the reins and trust the horses will take you back to the barn. -And that worked? -[sighs] Seemed to. Oh! This calls for a big, fat pork chop dinner. -Seriously? -[chuckles] How many households in Sandy Bottom have a conductor in residence? Besides, you'll need fortification for the Mozart next week. [Rachel] I couldn't recall a happier time. For one night at least, the Greens of Sandy Bottom seemed almost normal. [playing ragtime] [Rachel and Norman chuckling] That's a fine idea. Really capital. But we've got to get the town council to postpone demolition for a few weeks, because we need time to organize the clothing and the food bank. And we could finally move meetings out of that cramped townhall. It's got really magnificent walls for artwork, and the high school artists would have an absolute field day, I think. [sighs] Oh, I admire your dreams and your zeal. If I were ten years younger... I'd be on the front lines with you. What would I do without you? [demonstrators] ♪ No to pizza, yes to art ♪ Sandy Bottom have a heart! ♪ No to pizza, yes to art! -Mrs. Green! -Hi! Here, hold this sign up and maybe you'll be on the 6:00 news. I'm on it, Mrs. Green. You guys look great! My Broadway complex idea will bring in real dollars. Not just for me but for the whole town. And sooner or later the council will understand that simple fact. We will prevail. Right over might, every time. [Charlotte] Ingrid, are there any more petitions? They're all out there on the table. Why isn't Reverend Sykes here? I know he fired me, but he of all people should be here to support the food expansion. Haven't you heard? His wife's very ill; paralyzed with depression they say. He had to check her into a hospital in Milwaukee. -What? -Yeah, it's just awful. I guess she's been suffering with it for a long time. And now... Well, Jim's got his hands full. What with three boys and no wife to help out and... I thought you knew. No. [ringing bell] [car starts] [car drives off] ♪ Rock of ages cleft for me ♪ ♪ Let me hide ♪ Myself in thee ♪ Let the water and the blood ♪ From thy riven side ♪ Which flowed ♪ Be of sin ♪ The double cure ♪ Cleanse me from ♪ Its guilt and power Good morning. Before we begin today, I'd like to take a moment to thank you all for your concern about Miriam. I have communicated your cards and your calls to her... and I believe they are helping. I... I'd like to tell you about one... generous act in particular that has surprised me. And I thought, having ministered for 15 years, that there were no more surprises. But I was wrong. Last night... somebody left a week's worth of meals for me and my boys on our front porch. There was, uh... there was no note. Just the reassurance in that... lovely act of kindness in the dark that we are not alone. In my... in my deep distress, I had come to believe that we were. How wrong I was. [sighs] We misjudge each other... if in the heat of argument or disagreement, or in the simple routines of daily life, we fail to see that God is in each of us, always, struggling to love and to be loved in return. We are, none of us, alone. We belong to each other. I thank you, my anonymous friend, for refreshing my faith. [Rachel] The concert loomed. In just three weeks, my father would either make a complete fool of himself or become a local hero. He'd hired a wunderkind 16-year-old pianist from Green Bay to play the Mozart. The first rehearsal with him was scheduled for the coming weekend. Now, Mrs. Johnson, the temperature will be set at 72 degrees. Oh, no! I understand. Please. Don't give it a second thought. I agree. I think it's crucial that we protect his hands. Yeah. Bye-bye! Norman, what have you gotten yourself into? Um, Mrs. Johnson is a bit protective of young Drew. Well, she sounds like a kook if you ask me. But does he even know the Mozart? She says he does, forwards and backwards. Well, forward would be sufficient. -Yeah. -[phone ringing] All right, if this is her... tell her I'm milking a cow. Hello? Yeah, just one minute. It's Dr. Winters. Hello? How is she? It was a mild heart attack, but she's not responding to the medication. And she absolutely refuses to go to the hospital. She asked for you, Ingrid. Now, now. None of that. Are you in pain? Not so bad, really. You shouldn't have done so much. You should've rested more. I was living, Ingrid. And enjoying every minute of it. Please don't leave me. Well, I have to, dear. Sooner or later. You're the mother I would have chosen. [whispering] I know. And you're the... You're the only one in this whole silly town that I care about. [sobs] Oh, nonsense. You belong right here. Whether you know it yet or not. Every Sandy Bottom needs its Ingrid Green. [sighs] [children laughing] Jim, have you heard about Delia? I was at her house, right behind you. But she was sleeping when I got there. I'll call on her later. I, uh... [clearing throat] I came to see you. And I know it's not the best of times. Well, please, sit down. [sighs] I'll get right to it, Ingrid. I want you back as our choir director. We, uh... We just didn't know what we had... not until we lost it. Aw, heck, Ingrid, you know what that choir sounds like. [giggles] Please... say yes. Would the Worship Committee be approving the music? Absolutely not. You'd be sole captain of your ship. And how about Mrs. Granlund? Well, if... if we lose her, it'll be the Methodists' gain. [chuckles] Well, of course I'll come back. Oh, that's good! That... That's just fine. Hallelujah! Well, I'd better be going. How's Miriam? It'll take time. She's been very ill. The pressures on a minister's wife, always being pushed in front of people. It hasn't been good for her. [sighs] I'm thinking about leaving the ministry, Ingrid. It's the first time I've said it out loud. There's a good real estate course in Milwaukee, and, uh... We'd be close to the doctors if Miriam needs them. Change might be good for all of us. We would miss you... so much. [Sykes] Well... I think the town is still in good hands. I think these belong to you. Yep. Thank you again. And welcome back. [Rachel] Mother's curiosity finally got the best of her. She just had to see the piano wunderkind my father had turned up. Excuse me. Where might I find the conductor? Oh, he's in the corner. Oh, you must be Drew. Yes, it is. And I'm his mother, Mrs. Johnson. Ah, hello! Drew, wait there. [sighs] Would you mind? His name's Michele. Oh, no treats! Now, I don't care if the concert is in a bandshell, Mr. Green. Drew needs a private dressing room. Now I thought I made this clear. He can't share a common space because he needs to lie down when he's not playing. His sugar imbalance? Now I told you this on the phone! Mrs. Johnson, I'll see what I can do. Maybe we can get an RV or a camper... Well, whatever, but it needs to be quiet, and it needs to be dark, and curtains will be mandatory. Now, do we understand each other? I believe we do. Good. Okay, now I'll go check on Drew, and good luck with your rehearsal. [sighs] Ladies and gentlemen, it is my great pleasure to introduce our soloist, Mr. Drew Johnson from Green Bay. [applause] Could somebody close that door back there? There's a wind howling through here! Thank you! All right, shall we try the Mozart? A chill could ruin his performance. You know, I am so sorry about shoving Michele on you, Mrs. Green, but I thought you were a musician. [concerto begins] Drew? Is everything all right? That was your cue. You know, I don't think he can see you very well from where he is, Mr. Green. Carry on, Mr. Green. [musicians murmuring] [music resumes] [piano out of sync] [playing wrong notes] [loudspeaker feedback] Well, this piano bench is wobbling! You know, I could see that from here! Now if we could just take two minutes to see that it doesn't wobble anymore, I think we're going to save ourselves a lot of time here! [sighs] Amateurs! [woman] It's so embarrassing... In a good way. Excuse me! You know, I was told that this was a professional engagement! Well, it is! It is, Mrs. Johnson... [man] It is a professional engagement! -[Drew] Mom! -You know this boy is a... is a talented, sensitive individual. Mom, please! -Just back... just sit down! -Okay, all right. Let's take it from the top. I'm simply asking for some kind of cooperation and some kind of professionalism! If I could see that! -Mom! Please, Mom! -All right... -Just an iota! -Back off! Would you just not speak to me in that kind of voice?! I've got the dog shaking right now. I don't need you yelling at me! Mom, please! I am trying to build some kind of life for you! If you could just stay out of it for a minute! Well, you're ruining it... [Rachel] It went from bad to disastrous. Drew wound up in a shouting match with his mother. They called each other some pretty awful names before he finally stormed off the stage. And nobody in the orchestra, including my father, could disagree with him. [Mrs. Johnson] Michele, that's a good boy! [Rachel] It was a mess all right, and the end of Drew Johnson, soloist. [Mrs. Johnson] I've had enough of this circus. [chuckling] Oh, God! Well, it's not Sandy Bottom strawberry, you know, but it'll pass. So what are we going to do? A week away and no soloist. I don't know. I guess we're ruined. All right, Norman. All right, I'll do it! But it's a lot to ask any pianist to get ready that quickly. Honey, honey, honey! You know the music. Knew it! That was years ago! But you'd have to make your own meals, and, and keep the house picked up, because it's all I could do to get ready by Labor Day. We will cover for you, right, Rachel? Every second! Ah! All right, all right! Let's get a move on because there's no time to lose. Yes! Yes! [playing sad tune] That's so beautiful. I didn't know anyone was listening. -You mind? -No. So, um... how is baseball? We're winning more than losing. It's fun, I guess. Oh, Rache. I've been such a jerk! I got so sucked into my team and my new friends... it hit me that I'd almost lost you. And... you're my very best friend of all. Really? [Carol] I don't know anybody who's cooler than you, or more talented. I just... I just miss you. -Cooler? -Yeah. Can we hang out some night? Just the two of us. You know, like we used to. Tonight be okay? Huh? Still friends? Forever! Things are changing though, aren't they? A little. Maybe it's not so bad. [Rachel] We were worried. It was less than a week away now and mother still hadn't run through the entire concerto. It was time for drastic action. [Rachel] How's the Mozart coming? Fine. Absolutely fine. [Rachel] I thought you'd be practicing. Yeah, well, I started to and then I noticed how... really dirty these floors are and, um... I mean, I couldn't practice with all this dust all over the place. [Rachel] I could do that for you, you know. Rachel, don't be silly. Really, I'm fine. Just leave me alone, okay? Please, you're starting to remind me of your father. [Rachel] Okay, Mom. Thank you. Yes, Norman. What is it? Speak! [Norman] You need to rehearse. You said so yourself. Well, you know... I know what I said. The only problem is... I can't do it! Of course you can, honey! You've got stage fright, that's all. They love you, Norman! This whole town thinks the sun rises over your shoulder. But they will not accept music from me! Well, you haven't even offered yet! Um... Oh, I got it! You know? I finally got it, Ingrid. You are a phony! What? For years you have groused about not fitting in in Sandy Bottom. Right? Everyone is beneath you! "Teeny little minds"! Isn't that what you always say? Boy, that sure makes it easy, doesn't it? That way you never have to get down on their level and offer yourself honestly and actually ask for their affection. So in your mind you become this little lonely island of one! Sandy Bottom doesn't want me! They've made that pretty clear! I'm Sandy Bottom, darling... And I am no different than anyone else. You know, I work, I... I raise my kid. I've tried to make sense of this crazy world and I find it comforting that there are others like me up and down these streets, trying to do the same thing! Ingrid, all I have ever wanted was to do those things with you. [bell ringing] Delia? [Ingrid weeping] [Sykes] For everything there is a season. And a time for every matter under Heaven. A time to be born... [Rachel] My father said it sometimes took a death to remind people how much they had in common, how much their lives depended on each other. [Sykes] ...and a time to laugh, a time to mourn. And a time to dance. [Rachel] My mother took it very hard. She didn't seem able to do anything, much less touch the piano for two more dark days. You've been out here awhile. Do you need anything? No, thank you. Yes, come sit with me. When I was a little girl, your grandfather would take me out in the backyard on summer nights like this. Just the two of us, for hours on end. And he would tell me stories... about the stars. Brave Orion, and the Big Bear. And Andromeda. And it made me feel so safe. What will you remember? Um... the meadows out by the dairy. Mm-hmm. The smell of Saturday morning crullers at the bakery. [giggling] Um... maple trees, when they turn that deep gold. The way Mrs. Wyman yells hello from her front porch. [both chuckling] Things like that. Well... I guess Sandy Bottom's not all bad. It's home! But I do wonder about other places. New York, Boston, London, Paris. Maybe you can have both? You know, I'm really sorry about Mrs. Ferguson. Me too. Uh... I just thought of something else I'll remember. Your piano playing. I'm your mother, you have to say that. [giggles] No. When you play... especially when you think that no one's listening to you, when you're happy, or sad about something, the music you make... it's... it's like your heart's talking. I've always hoped one day... that... I would be able to play... to feel... like you do. That is one of the sweetest things I've ever heard. You know that it's a shame that other people don't get to hear you play. Oh, maybe I... I really don't have that much to offer. Spoken like a true artist. [laughing] [sighs] I'm going to go to bed. Rachel? When did you get so wise? Good night. [piano playing] [Rachel] My mother didn't get much rest that night, or the day after that, or the day after that. The surprises kept coming that week. On the 2nd of September, Mr. Bateman, the attorney in town, asked my parents in for the reading of Delia's will. "And my other personal effects, including household goods, to be auctioned. The proceeds sent to my brother's family in Duluth. With one exception: to Ingrid Green, I leave my husband's watercolor. She'll know which one. And in her name, I bequeath a quarter of a million dollars for the renovation and preservation of the Ramsey Building..." -But... -"...with the understanding that at least part of the building will be forever maintained as a food, clothing and employment center for people in need. I also leave a quarter of a million dollars to the Sandy Bottom School District, on the condition that nothing impede my wishes for the Ramsey." [woman gasps] [Rachel] We got to the park early. My father said we could put on our dresses at the bandshell. It looked like all of Sandy Bottom was turning out. [Ingrid] Look at all the cheeses. It looks great! Oh, it looks great! Oh, look! Rhubarb pie! -Look at that stuff up there! -I love rhubarb! [Rachel] Oh, and blueberry! [Ingrid] Your favorite! And there's a little caterpillar made out of potatoes. And there... Oh, my goodness. -Oh, Mom. -Ingrid. Hello, Mayor. Oh, Mrs. Green, so you got your wish after all, eh? That Delia was a sly one. I have to say I didn't see that coming. I know you were disappointed. Well, sure I am. But it's hard to find fault with a gift like that. It wouldn't serve my next mayoral race. [laughs] Always thinking. [mayor] Name of the game, Ingrid. Well now, well, what about you? You beat me on the Ramsey, but I bet you couldn't hit the broad side of a barn with a baseball. Oh? Pay the man, Norman. [laughs] [laughs] [mayor] Somebody get the lady a basketball. [laughing] Oh, sign her up for the other team right away. Aww. [laughs] [man] Heavy hitter here. [ding!] [cheers and laughter] [playing "My Country 'Tis Of Thee"] [applause and cheers] Thank you. Thank you very much. And now something we hope really delights you, Mozart's A-major piano concerto, number 23. We have a change in the program. Due to circumstances beyond our control, Mr. Drew Johnson will not be performing with us this evening. Instead it gives me great pleasure to introduce... Ingrid Green. [applause and cheers] [playing concerto] [Rachel] Mother was luminous that night. I don't think she ever looked or sounded more beautiful. It was as if everything came together under the stars. This was like a dream. [Scott] Hey, Rachel! Wait up! You really were... What a night. I know, I'll never forget it. Well, will you be back at Mr. Amidore's again this fall? Oh, um... -No. -No? Actually, I'm... I'm going to Interlochen. If they'll take me. No way! I'm going there too. I was afraid I'd be lonely. [laughs] Oh! It's great! It really, really is beautiful. [Rachel] In the years ahead, I did see Paris and London and many other beautiful places. But I was always glad to return to my happy parents... in the town where we belonged.
