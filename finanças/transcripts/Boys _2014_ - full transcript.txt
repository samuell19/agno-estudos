BOYS On your marks. Get set. Sieger, Stef. You were both well under 13. You can join the B selection. Congratulations. Marc and Tom are also very fast runners. I want you four for the relay race. Okay, time for your cool down run. Hey, kid. How did it go? It went okay. Stef and I were both promoted to the B Juniors. That's great. - We're going to run the relay race. I suppose that means you'll have to train more often. Yes, three times during the week, and once during the weekend. Ed, you know the agreement. No moped. Hey, Eddy. Hey Dad, nice to see you. Ed, behave yourself. - Yes, boss. Have you heard? Sieger's been promoted to the B Juniors. No one's forcing him. Go. Keep going. Come on. Keep the grip. Don't make it a competition, it's a workout. Have you started yet? Let me know when you're ready. - Alright. I mean, it wouldn't be fair if I were to start... while you still needed time. Go. Go. Go. Can I have a soft ice cream? - One soft ice cream. Make that two. - Sure thing. Ten to twelve, purple jacket. Nice. - I saw her first, alright? How do you want to approach her? 'You have beautiful eyes'. - Well, thanks. Faggots. Never mind him. There you go. - Thank you. One more, with sprinkles. Ed, do you have money for a present for Dad? Why not 70? - You'll get in trouble with the police. Someone came to see it. - For Father's Day. Come on, you know it's important to him. In my coat, in the canteen. Loser. What about this one? This one. - My dad has that one. Really? Are you okay there? Sure. I want to buy this one. Hey. - Hey. What are you doing? Beyonc?? No. - J'adore? Am I right? And hers? Do you know? You have to smell it, of course. Adidas? - Well guessed. We have to go. - Where are you going? It was fun. - See you next time. Boys, this is a long time ago. - Exactly one year. Sieg, Ed, fantastic. Even more? - Yes. Stef's mother always buys it for his father. So? - So she knows her stuff. Put it back, or you'll be assailed by women. I don't need shower gel for that. - Oh no? Come on, spill it out. Are you alright? Sieg, think about your steps. Long steps. It's in the details. Long steps. Make long steps, okay? Long steps. Do you like it or not? Be honest. In between, is that okay too? - Sure, then you're always safe. It was a present. Does your mother have good taste as well? My mother is dead. My mother is crazy. At least, when it comes to bandanas. You're fast. What's your secret? Nothing. A lot of training. I'm focusing on my knees now. The higher I lift them, the better my steps. I see. And always with one sock pulled up and the other one down? And you? What do you do? I run and that's it. You mean you never count? No. But you need some kind of focus, don't you? I run at my best when I don't think about anything. Sometimes I only realise after the race I've run. Who wants to go swimming? - Yep. And you? - Yes. Are you coming, Sieger? Yes. Let's see who's in the water first. He's really crazy. Where are you going? - Dinner time. Dinner time? Are you going too? - Yes. Come on, have another swim. We're just getting started. Watch out. Bye. - See you. Hey. - Hey. Lower. Lower. I'm not gay. Of course you're not. Hey, where have you been? - Nothing, just swimming. That's all? I'm going left, see you. Hey, Dad. - Hey, kid. I've inspected it already. I already had my dinner. It's in the kitchen. Have you heard from Eddy? Why didn't you call? This isn't a hotel, Ed. We live together. That's why we have rules. They also apply to you. Hey. - Hey. Alright, I've determined the sequence. Stef, you're our starter. Tom, second runner. Then the exchange between Marc and Sieger. Now you know who your partner is. It all comes down to details. Everyone knows what to do. Where were you going yesterday? - None of your business. Just tell me. - Get lost. I'll find out anyway. What are you doing here? Get lost. You'll keep your mouth shut, okay? - Is it yours? Eddy, come on. - None of your business. Where did you get it? - Keep your mouth shut. Don't tell dad. Will you keep it shut? - Yes. So you're Bas's sister? - Bas? I don't know any Bas. I'm sure I've seen you before. Do you have any idea, Sieg? She didn't want to tell us where they were going. Have you been looking for us? - Day and night. Now you've found us. Shall we go? Hey. - Hey. Do you do that often? - Three times a week. How many? - Wait. Three series in one minute. What are you doing? - This. Give it a try, then you'll see for yourself. You just have to dare to. - Just dare to? Just do it. - Just do it. Impressive. Are you the only runner in the family? - My brother used to run as well. Why did he stop? It was after my mother's motor accident. I'm not really sure. Was he faster than you? - Was. What about your family? - My little sister is only seven. My parents only got married recently. They wanted my sister and me to be old enough to enjoy it. But we nearly missed the ceremony. My sister had locked herself in the toilet. How about a sorbet? Yes? Then let's go. - Alright. What will it be, sir? We have the Pear Stick, the Mini Magnets, Turbulence, what else... Hey. - Hey. Peek-a-boo. - Hey, Neeltje. I got your shoes, they're in your room. - Okay, thanks, Mom. This is where I live. This is Sieger. - Hey, Sieger. Made a choice yet? Idiot. Neeltje. Dizzy? Somersault. - Somersault? One... two... Oh-oh, Neeltje. Now this is training. Enough. Go play with him now. Two, three. Alright. One, two, three. Won't you be late for work? - They won't miss me. Eddy. - Just joking, I'm off. Come, come here. Good. Hey. - Hey. What's his name? - Billie. Hey, Billie. My name is Sieger. I think he likes you. Billie, come. I have to keep warm. - Yes. Bye. - Bye. Why are you home? They didn't need me today. - What? Are you going steady yet? Well? Sieger. Hey, Sieger. Are you all right? - Hey. They never give you enough. Sir, can I have some mayonnaise? New shoes? - Yes. These have thicker soles. Quite a change. Stef. We're going. Nice girl. Okay guys, we're off. Most of you are coming along for the fun of it. But our four championship runners are in for a serious training weekend. They'll have to defend the honour of our club. Wood. We need more wood. Coming. Heaps of it. What are you doing? I can't sleep. What do they mean, no dropping? Am I too heavy? - Not at all. Otherwise just say so. Shall we stay here forever? Would you like some orange juice? - Nice. Yes, please. Does it fit? - No problem. Here, to wash it away. Why don't you have a banana as well? Don't look like that. We're there. See you guys. - Bye. Shall we bike together? - Yes. I'm going to see Kim tonight. And you? - I don't know. I'll see. Where did you get it from? - Afriend. That's not true, Ed. - It's the truth. Arnold has seen you ride on it several times already. Does it matter? - Do I have to hear it from a customer? They know more about you than I do. - That's your own choice. What is? - Lf I can't do anything... why should I tell you? I'm not a child anymore. You sure behave like one. Dad, Ed knows how to ride. - So you know as well? Anything else I should know? Then tell me now. Sieger. Just be relaxed towards him. He'll come around. He's just an asshole. - Sieg. Just keep the moped away for now. Hey. - Hey. Are you coming to the fair? - Would you like a drink first? No, we're going. Well, have fun. - Thank you. Bye. Try it again. - It's that thing, there's no other way. Sure, blame it on that thing. - Okay, one more time. Hey, Sieger. - Hey. Now you try, okay? This is Jessica, by the way. That's Marc. Hey. - Hey, I am Marc. Okay, here we go. You got it. How do you do that? Can I have it? Hey, there's Eddy. Are you coming? Dad, what is this? - It stays on there, kid. Give me the keys. - No way. Come on. That chain stays on there. - That moped is mine. I thought it was a friend's. - No, it's mine. Then you should stop lying. I'm fed up with it, you know. - Dad. Come on. Give me those keys. General rehearsal, Stef. Ready, go. Go. Go. Go. Hey, Sieg. What's the matter? Nothing. - Sieg, don't spoil it for the others. Do you have a girlfriend? Sieger. - Hold on. Sieger? - Hey, Dad. Have you seen Eddy? - No, why? He hasn't worked at the sawmill for a month. Did you know about that? - No. Do you have training now? Good, good. Your dad? Trouble with my brother. What do you want? Well? Would you like to go swimming tonight? Swim? Alright. What time shall we meet there? Where's my moped? I have some questions for you too. - Where's my moped? Where's my moped, I asked. First a few questions. You've been fired, right? We'll talk about it, but let's eat first. I wish you were dead instead. Have you seen Eddy? - Hey, Sieg. Have you seen Eddy? - I don't know where he is. Do you know where Eddy is? - What? Is it yours? - Yes, it's mine. Cool. - Nice, isn't it? Ed. Shall we go for a spin? - Yes. Get in. Ed. Ed, please come home. - Come on, get in. Eddy. - Come on, Sieg. Just get in. - Ed, come with me. You can go home. But I wish you would come. Get in. Are you fine, babe? - Yes. You too? What's that guy doing? Bugger off. - Sieg, you know him, right? Come on. We have to get by. We were supposed to meet. Well? Do you need help, Sieg? What are you doing? Is he touching you, Sieg? Dickhead. Ed, could you please stop? Ed, stop. Stop! Stop! Idiot. Hey, kid. What's the matter? Sieg? I'll come to pick him up right away. Yes, see you shortly. Sieger. Sieg. Eddy's been arrested, for joyriding. I have to go there. I don't know if I'll make it. Hold on, I have something for the race. I've bought you new shoelaces. Hey, good luck. You can do it. Ready? Hey. - Hey. Boys, right away to the track. There's not much time. Get your starting number and warm up in position. I don't want to see any sprints, focus immediately. Hey, did you hear that? - Yes. You too? - Yes. Marc. - What? Sorry. Good luck with your charade. Ladies and gentlemen, a few more minutes to go before the relay race... we've all been waiting for. Six teams, 4 times 400 m, that's a lot of runners, 24 altogether. What athletes and teams do we have? AC Sprint is ready in lane two, Start '63 in lane three... AC Athens in lane four, AC Atlon in lane five... and AC MBN in lane six, and finally, in the outside lane... the lane with the long straight curves, Kracht '85. I see that the starter is almost ready, the jury is almost ready... the athletes are eagerly waiting, so the relay race will soon begin. Congratulations. Terrific. Hey. - Hey. Water? Eddy? Eddy? Go ahead and set the table. Do it outside for this occasion. Hey Stef. I'm going to get Chinese, to celebrate. Will you join us? - Sure. You and Marc... Marc and you... That went really well. Good timing. Let's see what we have here. Give me a hand. Alright. Well boys, cheers. Cheers. - To victory. Where was Jessica? - She couldn't make it. Eddy, get a lamp from the shed. - It's still light. Dad. - Yes. Dad, what is this? Where did you hide it? - Behind the guest bed. Are you okay, Sieg? No. Sieg! - Hey!
