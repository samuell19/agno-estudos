Where was the donut invented? - Berlin? - Vienna. According to legend, Vienna. But they are called Krapfen there. - Nine to nine. - Match point. Your final question? Okay, how many hearts does an octopus have? One, two, three or four hearts? - Is that a trick question? - I know it. - Don't say anything. Be quiet. - Three. I got to go. That's right. Matze! - I am in here! - Matze? Have you seen my star shirt? Karl, listen. Lena and I were talking. She'd like to move in. She already lives here. We want to take the next step. As a couple. Just the two of us. You want me to move out? I wouldn't say it like this, but if you are offering... Listen. It's hard to live with your girl and your brother. - It's time you grow up. - You sound like Mom. - No, I don't. - Yes, you do. - I don't wanna throw you out... - But you are. For some Tinder girl. - You said Tinder is just for... - ...sex? Bathroom is free. When you've found the one it doesn't matter how you met. I took your... Thanks. KONNOPKE'S SNACK STALL So... If you could only eat one sausage for eternity, what kind would it be? Okay, but I need some more info. Allergies? Religion? Married or single? Well, asking if I'm single or married is a dessert question. Sorry. A Vienna sausage. - Hello. - Hi. I'll have a pair of Vienna sausages and a currywurst. Thank you. It's a bit disappointing. I tell you my favorite and you choose another one. Sorry, I'm not a cannibal. I'm from Vienna so I can't eat Vienna sausage. I'm Karl. Nini. One of my favorite movies is set in Vienna. Yes. BOSS WORK You have plans today? Konnopke was my last stop. I'm exploring Prenzlauer Berg and catching the bus. It's my neighborhood. Care for a tour? Yes. Cool shirt. Thank you. Did you know that the stars, we see at night, are the same that Plato, Goethe, and Napoleon admired? And what famous women gazed upon them? Nefertiti, Marie Curie, Rosa Luxemburg... I tell you... If he does not... We are not quite ready to get married. My boss. I should be at work by now. Can I help you? We have an appointment. We do? Mr. Meier and future Mrs. Meier? My name is Meier. He's the future Mr. Meier. You are a bit early. Please follow me. The cakes are waiting. To our future. Know what Jerry Lewis said is the main reason for divorce? Marriage. You Germans are famous for your charm. Experiencing it for real is a real privilege. It's amazing. Wanna try? I only eat Sachertorte. I bet they have Sachertorte, too. But not the original. You can only get that at Café Sacher. Every year on my birthday, I meet my dad at Sacher. We eat Sachertorte at 3 p.m. sharp. Really? It's our sacred tradition. We always had pickled herring for birthdays. Do you have a tag line for the wedding? Yes. Can you tell her? Well... He is our stargazing charmer. Right, we were thinking... Omnia vincit amor. Of course. Excellent choice. Love conquers all. Yeah. Shit, I have to go. - Hello, can I help you? - Hi, Meier. We have an appointment. - You'll make it. - Yeah. Thanks for carrying my bag. And for the great morning. I have to thank you. You're a gentleman. Gentleman? Always in the nick of time. I'd like to see you again. - Can I have your number? - I won't be late because of you two. - Let's go. - Okay. - Close the door. - Just a second. - I'll call you. - Save the number. Yes. "Hay" is for horses. I am not one. Don't answer that. Why didn't you come to the meeting? Sorry, something came up. Karl, now listen up! You are a smart guy, but that does not mean you can come and go as you please. Tomorrow I am back, I promise. Well I'd hope so. No, no, no. You've got to be kidding me! Matze, if you enter a number into a phone, but then you get a call, the number is saved, right? - What do you mean? - She gave me her number. Now it's gone. That's why you save it. Thanks, I am not an idiot. Can the number be recovered? Can't you get a new smart phone? Matze, this is a love or death situation. In that case... I'll ask Lena. Okay. - Lena? - Yes? Karl put in an important number but got a call. Is it gone? Yes, that number is gone. - Karl? - Yes! - The number is gone. - Shit. Hi. - The last bus to Vienna. - It left ten minutes ago. The next one is tomorrow. If you buy the ticket now, you get a discount of 20%. I don't want a ticket. Can you get in touch with the bus? I bet you can do that. Why would I want to contact a bus? I lost something. Go to Lost and Found. - It's about a person. - Then go to the police. The person is on the bus and I lost her number. - The bus driver... - You mean the steward. Can the steward make an announcement so I can get her number? We are not a store where you can make an announcement to find your kids. This woman on this bus is probably the love of my life. If you don't help me, I will never see her again. You... You are my only hope. Please. - Hi. - Hi, Günther. Can you make an announcement? Yeah, sure. Hold on. What's her name? Mini, no. Hold on. You don't know her name? Are you sure she's the love of your life? We just met. Just say... Mr. Before Sunrise is looking for Ms. Sachertorte. - Günther? - Yes? Mr. Before Sunrise... is looking for Ms. Sachertorte. Okay, I'll do it, honey. - Thanks. - Let's see what happens. Okay. Wait and see. May I have your attention, this is your steward speaking. A Mr. Peter Sunrise is looking for a Miss Sacha Torte. Miss Sacha Torte. And did you find her? I don't even know her real name. She doesn't even know what happened. She is on the bus to Vienna waiting for my call. What if she is my person and I never meet anyone like her? There's a flight. You could be in Vienna in time to meet the bus. You just have to hurry. Thank you. Nini! Mini! - Don't attack him. - Attack? Baci doesn't like to be touched. Baci? The dog attacked me. - Now you can attack whoever you want. - No, thanks. Baci, let's go. Nini? Nini? Hello? Where the hell are you? What are Vienna sausages called in Vienna? A: Lyonnaise, B: Frankfurter, C: Hamburger, D: Parisian? That's a typical "Karl" question. For 100 euros, right? My little Karl. We work for a respectable quiz show. Can you come up with a harder question? What did you bring this time? Oh, it's all ready. "Sachertorte, 1832. "Prince Metternich wanted to serve "a special dessert to important guests. The head chef was sick, "Franz Sacher, aged 16, had to come up with something." "Years later, his son Eduard refined the recipe" "during his apprenticeship and then later, he also served it at his hotel." - Nice. - The champagne guy? Wasn't it invented for his birthday? - I thought it was Anna Sacher. - She made the hotel famous. That's it. 3:00 p.m. sharp at Sacher. Johann Söhnlein made the first sparkling wine for Metternich. - Can I talk to you? - Go ahead. - Now. - Sure. New city, new inspiration. You always say, "Think outside the box." For that, you have to leave... the box. Where is Beethoven buried? Where did Freud write his revolutionary book? In which European city did Orson Welles film The Third Man? Those were 400 euro questions at most. Okay. In Austrian, the word "to attack" means A: To attack, B: To touch, C: The word is not used, and D: Attack and touch. Okay, then. Let's give it a try, but... you will also do all the fact checking, without overtime pay. And if you are late just once, then Vienna is over. Deal! Let's hope so. It's simple. I wait every day at Sacher until her birthday. That's absurd. - You wanted me to move out. - But not to go to Vienna. It's crazy. The probability you'll meet her is zero. A year has 365 days. One of them must be her birthday. On the first day, the chance is 365 to 1. And it gets better each day. Let's assume, you see her after 365 days. She might not be the one or she's met someone. - Then you wasted a whole year. - And if she's the one? I don't want to regret forever that I could not wait one year. Seventy to one. Seventy to one? That's insane math. I think it's romantic. It's insane and absurd. - It is what it is, says love. - I thought you are on my side. - You wouldn't do this for me? - No. Lena, wait! I didn't mean it like that. Can I help you? Yes, I would like to go to Café Sacher. Go back outside, take a right, it's just there. - Thanks. - You're welcome. He's skipping the line! How rude! Well, well, well, well! Why are you rushing? - I came for coffee and Sachertorte. - You are not the only one. - Do you have a reservation? - No. Then please take a place in the line. Can I look inside? Someone might be waiting for me. Either someone is waiting for you or not. There is no maybe. - It's important. - Everything is important. My guest's privacy is important to me. - If you would... - Schwartz! Good day, my lady. Your table is ready. What's going on? The young man has neither a reservation nor patience. Let him sit with me. Some youthful company is very refreshing. Wouldn't you prefer some better company, my lady? What I like is something I decide for myself. Thank you, Schwartz. I don't think he wants to. He will sit down. Please. Thank you. My coffee and the newspaper. Very well. But... Schwartz! Aren't you going to take the young man's order? Don't be so rude! What would you like? - Sachertorte and coffee, please. - We are a Viennese coffeehouse. We don't just do plain coffee. We offer a variety of all manner of caffeinated drinks. Then, I'll have a cappuccino, please. A Mélange, then. And a whole cake. No. Just one piece. - Thank you, Zora. - My pleasure. In the past, all the best people in Vienna used to come here. Now, only tourists. Are you a tourist? No, I'm not a tourist. I'm Karl. Arendt. - Franziska Sawallisch. - Here you are! Thank you, Zora. Kind of you. My pleasure, Mrs. Sawallisch. - Your first time? - First time having real Sachertorte. The first time is unforgettable. It is the measure for all that follows. Enjoy it. Yummy. It's delicious, or it's exquisite, or it's a dream. But please, don't say it's yummy. It's a dream. After you. Can I reserve a table for tomorrow? Ask the gentleman over there. I doubt he will ever give me a table. You sat with Mrs. Sawallisch. It could be difficult. Don't worry. I'll sneak in your reservation, but keep quiet. Name? Karl Arendt. Okay. I'm Karl. - Are we waiting for someone? - Yeah. We are waiting for Udo. He'll be here soon. You sent him the email. You're not a woman. Or am I missing something? Man, Udo! Can you no longer tell the difference between man and woman? He is German, that's right. I've been emailing a woman called Karla Rendt. We are already three men. We need a little estrogen. Don't be silly. He can take the test. He just has to have the right answers. How do I meet a good woman for me? Okay. You can move in only if you answer his question. What question? I don't speak Norwegian. Norwegian? He is from Vorarlberg. It's true. You Germans need subtitles to watch our movies. Okay, how can Hirs finally meet a woman? Well, I can't say how Hirs will find her, but... I wait at Sacher every day till she shows up. Is he crazy, or is this German humor? He could be totally crazy. Or he's just a totally cool dude! He plays his cards close to his chest. We have to keep an eye on him. Welcome to our apartment. - This is Hirs from Vorarlberg. - Hi, there. - Raul, from Vienna. - Hi. And I'm Udo, from Burgenland. So, you can move in. Your room is over there. Let's go before we start to rust. Go ahead. KUB KNOWLEDGE ZÄKET INTRANET SOFTWARE YOU ARE NOT CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET I've been through dangers, toils, and snares I have already come 'Tis grace has brought me safe thus far And grace will lead me home I think... I can't stress this enough. We need to talk to our partners. - Hirs? - Sorry, give me a second. I can't connect to the internet. Udo. - Yo! - The internet does not work. The router only allows three logins. Otherwise it's too slow. You have to wait. I have an important deadline. My boss will kill me. I know how that is. The door. YOU ARE NOT CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET There is WiFi here, right? Normally, but the network has been down all day. Pardon me. - Hello? - One second. - Do you have WiFi? - Yes. We have cake. No, that's the password. "We have cake," all one word. Gotcha. Hey! Baci, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to step on your tail. You're not much use, are you? And you just watched her do it? I... I mean we know each other. What? A few days ago at the bus station. That was you. They were in the oven too long. Really? You think? Yes. I can't believe it. - You just watched her steal my macarons. - Well, only one. Now you're giving me baking tips? It's not my fault. If anything, it's poetic justice. Poetic justice? For what? What did I do to you? - You made me miss the love of my life. - Not because of me. If not for you and the dog, I would be in heaven right now. You know what? You should look for your seventh heaven. I don't think it's here. Oh, you again. I have a reservation. - I doubt it. - I took the reservation. Thank you. Here you go. - For you? - Sachertorte and a Mélange. Right away. You come every day? Then you should try the apple strudel. Sachertorte, melange, and a water. Thanks. Don't. Not yet. Take it out. Will you marry me? Yes! Yes! You look like you are going to cry. It's like a movie. Let's just hope the movie has a happy ending. That's the happy ending. That? That's just the beginning. Hi. And? Did she show up? What? At Café Sacher? Did she show up? No, she didn't. Too bad. Oh, well. Tomorrow, the probability will be 364 to 1. Three to 365. I think that's so old school. But I think it's really nice. Thank you. Know what? Maybe I should try it too. Don't tell the others that I can speak proper German. Karl, we had to change the questions at short notice. Fact check by tomorrow 8 a.m. What is a "Tschecherl"? A: A Czech child, B: A simple coffeehouse, C: A passionate kiss, D: A small beer YOU ARE NOT CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET This can't be real. Oh, God. I'm sorry. This is not what it looks like. It was an emergency, I had nowhere else to go. Come on in. Standing there, you're just blocking my entrance. Why are you here so early? To save the early birds with a need for coffee. And you? Never seen a tramp with laptop before. - Tramp? - Someone who lives on the street. I am not a tramp. My apartment has no internet. May I? Mobile hotspot? I have used up all my data. I'll finish my work and you'll never see me again. Who said: "In a café you can find people who want to be alone but need company"? A: Fried rich Nietzsche, B: Alfred Polgar C: Sorry, didn't mean to scare you. It's fine. When I bake, I forget about the world. EMAIL SUCCESSFULLY SENT I'm done. - Sorry for the inconvenience. - Here's something to remember me. - Thank you. - No problem. Hello. Hi, there. - You're too late. - You missed me, right? I expected you yesterday. I had to close and make the deliveries with the dog. Yesterday, today, tomorrow. The cookies don't care, right? Macarons are made with egg whites. They last 24 hours. In the fridge, a maximum of 3 days. Then the egg white goes bad. A risk of salmonella. You watch too many food shows. No, quiz shows. - Right. - Yes. You know I live in the moment. She likes that about me. So much that we broke up. Okay, Albert, take him for walks. And bring him back on Monday. Not Tuesday, not Wednesday, Monday. Okay? - I'd like to rely on you. - But you can. Sooner or later, I always come back to her. I am not a loser with a full schedule. Not even Mr. Quiz Show plans his days. I go to Sacher at 3 p.m. sharp every day. He doesn't count. He is German. Okay, Albert. Thank you. Baci. Baci. Come on. See you later. - Sorry, he doesn't mean any harm. - Your ex? - You go to Sacher every day? - Yes. To find the woman from the station. I only know that she goes there at 3 p.m. Oh, no! Burned again? No, just right! Want to try? Can I take one to go? I am sure they are yum... a dream. You can work here again. It doesn't bother me. - I'm Karl. - Miriam. Okay, I have to go. You just come to see me? No worries, I know the look. - You are waiting for someone? - Yes. I have a good feeling today. I'm sure she'll come. - The usual? - Please. No Mélange. She always has a coffee with cream. Don't be so hard on him. You were young once. I beg your pardon, but I am still a bit young. If you're young, then what am I? - Here you go! - Forever beautiful. You old charmer. Young charmer. - Look, he is doing it perfectly. - Thank you. The water is on the wrong side. - Now it's right. - Thank you. - You can go now. - Yes, sorry. He has to learn somehow. She'll come tomorrow. REMINDER She'll come tomorrow. E-MAIL SENT SUCCESSFULLY Don't give up. She'll come. That'll be seven euros. Thank you. - Thank you, have a good day. - Thanks, bye. Always that annoying alarm. You believe his story? Why not? The last few days he's also left at 2:30 p.m. on the dot. If he is at Sacher every day, he has to order something. It's not cheap and inefficient. Bye. - Bye. - Bye. If he really wants to find this girl, there are 1,000 better ways. He could use Facebook or Instagram. He just invented the story. So it's true. I had to see for myself. - If she comes, you have to leave. - Exciting. What's the probability? Today, it's 5.7%. Then I shall leave my jacket on. Is that her? I am not sure. What can I bring you? I'd like a small coffee with milk, please. I'm not his dream woman. Just one moment! What does she look like? Pretty. Pretty? - What does that mean? - Well, pretty. Yeah, but is she short or tall? Is she fat, thin, blonde, brunette? What color are her eyes? You don't know her eye color? Every woman is pretty in her own way, eye color does not matter. Can I try it? - Bon appetit! - Thank you. What was so special about her? I can't describe it in words. It was more... like a feeling. Maybe she'll come tomorrow. - I feel a bit guilty. - Really? You missed her because of Baci and me, now you have to wait forever at Sacher. - There are worse places to wait. - I want to help you. A girl from Vienna can find another girl. All right! - Carol a, I am leaving. - Okay. Don't be sad about your girl, you always meet twice in life. How did you know that about macarons? - It was a 300-euro question. - You are a quiz show fan. Not a fan, it's my job. - What? - Yeah. - Really? - I think up the questions. You remember everything? I can't remember it all, but some stuff sticks. A Danube tributary with four letters. - Lech. - Isar. - Naab. - Vils. - Roth. - Blau. - Egau. - Elta. - Breg. - Bära. Günz. - Rodl. - Melk. What were your most absurd questions? That... Chopsticks is not a waltz but a polka. That all the hair on your head grows a kilometer per month. That won't be a problem for you. I recently read that erotic novels for women feature most of all surgeons, pirates, billionaires, vampires and werewolves. Would you confirm that? As a woman? Unapproachable men are tamed by virtuous, pure women! - It's not about the taming! - No? I don't want to have a guy just how I imagine him. - So? - To love means to see them as they are. Not what you wish or dream, but who they really are. That's what love is. - Can I open this? - Sure. What is that? An optimist. - Keep the change. - Thanks. You always give him those puppy eyes. Nonsense. - Karl. Hello! - Yeah, I'm here. What? Yes, it's C. Hey. - Cool car. - Not a car. It's Ida. - Stack them up. - More? - Yeah. - Okay. - Hello? Miriam? - I'm opening the door! Hello? - She'll come tomorrow for sure. - Yes. Miriam, do you know... Hey. And? Who was the last emperor of Austria? A: Karl Otto Let's go! - Hey. - Got it done? Okay, new master plan: Social media. - Please, don't. - Come on. - Smile! - I'm still eating. - Smile! - Hang on! Post photos and hashtags of where you've been. Eventually, she'll see it. We need a name for your blog. If I did it... "Mr. Before Sunrise seeks Miss Sachertorte." It's my favorite film. Do you know it? What's it about? Two people meet on a train and spend a day in Vienna together. - And they fall in love. - Okay, and then? Then nothing. They are in love. You gotta watch it. Okay, wait. That's your favorite movie? Two people fall in love and that's the movie. That's how 90% of all romantic movies end. It's the perfect ending. It's better to imagine what happens next. Is that why you followed her? But love isn't a dream. It's complicated. It makes it more profound and beautiful. Where to next? Have you been outside Vienna? I don't wanna take the risk. Okay... Then let's go to the city limits. - This is the edge of the city? - For some people, it does. Vienna is pretty cool. - The Viennese can be grumpy. - Isn't that the same in Berlin? Sometimes I forget why I'm here. Stuff always happens, and then... and then it's 4 p.m., I pay my bill and then I remember. I am starting to get scared for when she shows up. - If she shows up at all. - What will you say to her? The truth. That you have waited for 100 days. What else should I say? Something funny. Be spontaneous. And play guitar at the same time? Just be yourself. Come on, let's practice. Imagine I'm her. No, don't. Fine. If you'd rather blabber some nonsense when you see her, go for it. It's your chance. Okay. Karl? What a surprise! What are you doing here? Crazy story. Remember that day in Berlin? Yeah, I lost your number. All I knew about you was that you come here on your birthday to eat Sachertorte. And I know it sounds totally crazy... but when I met you I knew you would change my life. And that I'd always regret it if I never saw you again. If I never asked you if you'd felt the same. That's why I am here. Because I'm waiting for you. - That's too much, right? - No. It's honest and brave and... If she feels the same way, why hide it? I have to go to Sacher. How much longer does it take? Give me your number. I'll send you the photos. I don't want to use social media. Bye! Okay, bye. Karl. Come on! Hey! It's just one cookie. Schwartz, how about a vase? When were Callas Who has Callas Callas... I can't think of anything. Her Tosca from 1953 was never surpassed. - Maria Callas. - Oh. I mean Calla palustris. Wild calla lilies. Yes, but did you know because she had a fight with Karajan, she only performed three times at the Vienna Opera. Three times! It's a disgrace! That's good. How many times did Maria Callas enchant the audience in Vienna? An 8,000 euro question. It's that easy? Schwartz, don't just use the red ones there. Put gold in between. My lady, by now, you should know how the tree is supposed to look. Yes, I know, but you seem to have forgotten it. Please leave some red ones for over here. My dear lady, I always decorate the one side first and then the other. Otherwise, I'd have to go up and down the ladder. And shifting the ladder. You can't do it anymore? We can ask Toni. Toni? I always decorate our tree. With feeling. But sadly without any taste. Karl! Please tell him how it looks. I'd say it looks nice. See, Mrs. Sawallisch, even he, this boy without taste, likes what I am doing. Schwartz, either we decorate the tree how I want or I leave. Sachertorte, Mélange, and a water. It's great what you're doing. That you're waiting for her. We need more romantics following their dream. She has to come today. I'm sure of it. You say that every day. But today, I mean it. Enjoy! So this Mr. Schwartz... I'm Georg Aigner, Director of Hotel Sacher. Karl Arendt. For 100 days, this man has come here to wait for the love of his life. An incredible commitment. Tradition is important to us. I would like to thank you for your commitment with a small gift. Toni? I'd like to gift you a voucher for one night in our hotel. Including a candlelight dinner for two. Thank you! Your visit today is on us as well. Now, excuse me. It was nice to meet you. I wouldn't mind a night at Hotel Sacher. If she doesn't show up, you can take me. You can't search for love. It will find you on its own. The trick is... I don't want to bore you. - I sound like an old lady. - Not at all. What is the trick? To not miss it, when it finds you. I'll remember that. Come with me. My husband, the love of my life. And who is that lovely lady? We almost didn't get married. Because we missed our chance. He was my best friend... before he became the love of my life. He was a conductor at the Vienna Opera. I watched all of his performances. Opera can be awful. But when it's good... an angel descends from heaven and kisses your soul. I've never seen an opera. That's outrageous. I'll get you tickets. That's not necessary. It's very necessary. Hang on, what's on at the moment? Tosca. Tomorrow at 7 p.m. Could I have two tickets? I'll pay of course. A friend of mine loves opera. A friend? See you tomorrow. Matze? What are you doing besides eating cake? I have been trying to reach you for days. Are you going to spend Christmas at the hotel? - If I have to. - And what about Mom? She never asks for anything. Christmas is important to her. I can't give up. It would have been all for nothing. I just can't. I'm coming. What? No! Matze? - Can I have a coffee, please? - Of course. - Hey. - Hey. I never really thanked you for your help and for letting me work here. True, you haven't. So... I got tickets for the opera tonight. It's not Callas, but... it's Tosca. Really? That's... I have to see if Carol a has time. I thought you and I might go. You and I? I mean... I didn't mean like a date. We don't think of each other that way. A platonic date? If you don't want to, it's no problem. You are probably sick of me. No, I'd like that. - Yes? - Yes. - Shall we meet at the entrance? - Yes, okay. - Okay. I can't wait. - Cool. See you later. It's okay. Bye. - Hi. - Hello. A cappuccino. You look snazzy today. You didn't tell me we had a date. Well then. Oh, Madam Councilor! - Thank you, Toni. - You're welcome. No, it's a gift. Thank you. Are you going to the opera dressed like that? - No? - No. I can't accept this. Nonsense. Please send Schwartz up. Why do you live in a hotel? I never liked laundry, cleaning, and cooking. Other people go to a retirement home. I chose Hotel Sacher. If anyone wants to see me, there are always enough rooms here. You are not that old! These days, I prefer to live in my memories. The best moments of my life happened here. The premiere parties. And the weddings. Come in. Thank you for coming, Schwartz. My dear lady, whenever you don't call me five minutes before my shift ends I end up going home with a weird feeling. - Sorrow. - Bliss. No time to chat. The opera doesn't wait, we are in a hurry. What's missing here? A gentleman to wear the tuxedo. - Shoe size? - Size 10. I also wear size 10, but... Swanky! Someone got cleaned up. You look enchanting. You don't go to the opera every day. I have cards with the plot in case you did not have time... Karl, this is the opera, not an exam. Right. It's three acts. It was so sad and beautiful! When I die, I also want to belt out an aria. I would have liked a happier ending. Emperor Joseph II decreed that the Burgtheater was not allowed to show sad endings. It's called the Viennese ending. - Joseph was a great guy. - Yeah. Are you hungry? - You eat sausage after the opera? - It's tradition. What are you having? - Cheese sausage. - It's on me. Two cheese sausages, bread, mustard, and two beers. You have to order what's on the menu. Two cheese sausages, bread, mustard, and two beers. We always talk about my dreams. - What are yours? - Dreams! - I have wishes. - Wishes? Such as? Such as... ice skating in Central Park with the man I love. - No! - Yes! Or smaller ones, like two armchairs I saw for the cafe. Want to see them? I need someone to help me pick them up. I'm your man. - You would dare to leave the city? - With you, yes. - As long as we are back by 3 p.m. - I promise. - You are freezing. - A bit. - I have to go. I have work to do. - Okay. - This was nice. - Nice. Shouldn't we do it again? - Okay. I'm going this way. - Me too. - No, I go the other way. - Okay. Where is my jacket? Tomorrow. VIENNA STATE OPERA TOSCA - Here you go. - Thank you. You know he loves someone else. He waits for her, not you, at Sacher every day, I'm sorry, but a car trip won't change that. Thank you. - Listen. - The trip tomorrow... Go ahead. I can ask Albert. It's no problem. Albert? No way. I'm coming. I thought because we will leave the city... We'll get back in time.

There are other nice guys waiting for you at... - Sass! - Sass! Come, it would be fun. It's not nice to see you like this every day. - Hello! - Hello! It's too big for Grandma's apartment. Luise, it'll fit. No, how is that supposed to fit? It'll be fine. - Hey. - Hello. Food for the trip and 250 euros. Excellent. - Don't you want to get dressed warmer? - It's only snowflakes. - There is no heater here, but okay. - Does this work? Yes. - It will fall off on the highway. - Don't stress. Hold my hand, don't let me fall You've such amazing grace I've never felt this way Show me Heaven, cover me Leave me breathless Show me Heaven This is so cool. Can you stop there? I need to pee. - That hurts. - Sorry. Okay. I give up. - We should go. - Yeah. - Thanks for taking me along. - Sure. Come on, Ida, not again! Not now! I'll push it. That's not the problem. This happened before? Ida is an old lady. She's got a few aches and pains. - Maybe the clutch... - Karl, please. - You have to... - I've got it, Karl. - Just let me... - Karl, please! Okay, I understand. Yes, thank you. Bye. The tow truck will be here in two hours. Two hours? It'll be 3 p.m. by then. To go to the countryside in winter in this piece of junk? "We will be back in time. I promise." How stupid is this? This is a waste of time! - Are you going to Vienna? - I wasn't going to. I'll give you 150 euro to take him to Vienna. Miriam, what are you doing? - Helping you to get back on time. - Is he German? Two hundred fifty euros. Okay, that works. The usual? No, today, I'd like apple strudel. We are out of apple strudel. Is Sachertorte okay? Keep your chin up. She'll come. A Mélange for you, sir? Not today, thank you. Did you bring my shoes today? I'm sorry, I just got stuck in the snow. I'll bring them tomorrow. Everything all right? Do you want an espresso? No, I don't want a large coffee or a coffee with cream or a Mélange! Today for a change, just a piece of Sachertorte without a drink! I'll go crazy if anyone says she'll come tomorrow for sure! My, my, my... Classy place, but that doesn't seem to be helping your mood. Matze! - This is where you spent 100 days. - More than 100. Will you stay for another 100? I'm worried about you, Karl. I'm fine. Who are you kidding? I know you, brother. I'm fine. How long did you try to help me walk again? How often did you push me out of the wheelchair? Dreamed that I would just walk. What do you mean? That I should not try? That I shouldn't dream? Your dream makes you so happy that you yell at the staff. Most climbing accidents don't happen on the way up, but on the way down. The climbers don't know when to turn around. I don't know if I want to see her. Or if I have to get the "what if" out of my head. If you're sure she's the love of your life, then stay. If not, be smarter than the dead climbers. Come home. How's Vienna's nightlife? I told Lena we'd go out and party. I think I know who we can ask. Great. #MRBEFORESUNRISESEEKSMSSACHERTORTE SASS CLUB tonight??? You're right! Let's party! I'm serious. That's where all the hot girls are. Can we talk about something else? Girls are all that matter. You sit at Sacher because of a girl. Feeling good? Udo knows some moves. So do I. Raul is really... - Miriam? - Karl? You know each other? You're not... Is that her? - Her? - Her? You know, your dream girl! - No, she is not. - No, I am not. - We are just buddies. - Yeah. Buddies, right! We came here to dance. You stood for too long. All alone. In the cold. Yeah, what are we waiting for? Miriam, about today... I hope the trip was worth it. Your brother can really dance. Yeah. - Listen, about Miriam... - We are just friends. So you are cool if I try my luck with her? Hey! Is your car okay? - I asked if your car is okay. - No. Do you want a drink? - Just leave me alone. - I'm trying to apologize. What good will that do? So you can feel better? Did you ever think how I feel when I watch you go to Sacher every day? To live out your dream girl fantasy? Do you think I'll just go on pretending I don't care? I can't do it anymore, and I won't. That is a waste of my time. I didn't mean it! Being with you isn't a waste of time. It sounded different earlier. What changed? - Karl, I've waited long enough. - Wait, Miriam! Oh, you better hurry up. Don't want to be late. Karl? Why are you up so early? I was out of line yesterday. I'm sorry. We all have bad days. Are you okay? I have an idea. Come with me. Come on. Whenever I feel sad, I come here. - You really inspired me. - How? I quit. What? Why? I always wanted to travel the world and now I'm doing it. You showed me that I should follow my dreams. Hi. Oh, there's our... What did you call him? Pity-party boy. Thanks for giving us your bed. Hey! No way! Look here, Udo! Emergency! Karl is in the paper. Your 15 minutes of fame! - Do people read this paper? - Yeah, but they don't admit it. - Plenty! - Then she'll show up at Sacher soon. - And Miriam? - Who will be the one? Croissant-cutie Miriam, or sweet Sacher-girl? - No matter, this goes on the wall. - Brilliant idea. Karl from Berlin? Is that you? And you are? Nini! You never called. Now I know why. Are you at Sacher again today? Yes, like every day. At 3 p.m. Will I see you? Crazy! Yes, I'm coming. See you soon. Thanks, that's nice... - Hey. - Hey. - Wanna get the chairs? I have your money. - They're gone. Can we sit down and talk for a moment? I have work to do. Just because you want to talk... I want to tell you one thing. Then you can ignore me. - I've fallen in... - What? - Hi! Am I late? - No. - Raul? - It was a great party, right? Ida is in the shop and I need a car. Raul is helping me. Why didn't you say something? We could've come together. It's already 2.45. You'll be late. Give me the keys. I'll drive you. - She knows what she wants. - Yeah. What's the matter? Let's talk on the way. - Miriam... - Check it out! Karl, it's you! Your dream girl is waiting for you at Sacher. - I don't want to go. - Every day you come home, sad... She never came. So sad. Miriam, what I wanted to say... Wow, this is exciting. We fought and suffered for love for so long. One for all and all for one Please listen to me! Miriam, stop. You're gonna kill us! Hey! You got shit for brains, asshole? Get lost! Such dedication. - Without us, you'd never find her. - I don't wanna go to Sacher. - You don't want to go? - I've been trying to tell you! If it's that important that you nearly kill us, then I'll go. Just to say goodbye. Please give me your number. We can talk later. Today of all days. I should have asked before. And save it immediately! I'll call you later! Yeah. You think he'll finally meet her? I don't think so, I know it. Your table is ready, sir. No, um... Karl! Nini. So you've waited here for me for over 100 days. Crazy, right? Yeah. But very romantic. Yeah... Even crazier, I... Today, it was to be my last time. I didn't think that you would show up today. - We said we'd meet. - We did? We messaged each other on Instagram. Miriam. While I was waiting for you, I met new people. This city and everything... it changed my life. You were the reason that I met her. Does that mean you are not hopelessly in love with me? I'm sorry. - I'm so happy you said that. - Why? It means I don't have to break your heart. You never called. I'm not very good at waiting. I'm not romantic at all. Anyway... I fell in love, too. Johnny Depp 2.0? How did you know? I didn't want to lie. Plus, he showed me the article. Why did you come at all? I wanted to see you one more time. And I did not want to make you wait until my birthday. Right, when is your birthday? August 24th. So, it was really nice seeing you again, Karl. Take care. No way! She just ditched him. I'll get him some cake for his broken heart. That won't be necessary. She wasn't the one. - Really? - No. MIRIAM PHONE: 00000000 Back to work! Watch where you're going, young man! Hey. - Is Miriam here? - No. - Will you give me her number? - No! I'll leave mine here. The message was clear. You had your chance and you messed up. Bye. Bye. Okay, everyone, let the betting commence. Tell me, who will Karl end up with? Big love with Sacher-girl. Bold move, but I'm in. - No, no, I bet on Miriam. - What? - That ship sailed. - Okay. Okay. That's 10, 20, 80, 85 euro... What? Quiet! Yes, she was there. But she has a boyfriend. - It does not matter... - Miriam! But she hates me. - So I can try my luck? - Don't be a jerk. - Raul! - Just joking. - Okay, but it's not funny. - Not funny. I suggest we go home tomorrow. Yeah. Time to go home. Sorry for only bringing them now. Thank you. Better late than never. I have to pay you a compliment. Your tenacity impressed me. What are you doing tonight? Going to Café Bräunerhof without you there. Old age! You go blind as a bat. Please read me what it says. It says you're perfect. Brown-noser. I might go blind, but I am not stupid. Here. I almost forgot about it. But it was a gift. My husband up there doesn't need it anymore. Do you remember what you told me? The trick of love? Not to miss it when it finds you. Promise me you won't make the same mistake I did. Bräunerhof. Tonight, when he gets off work. You are so melodramatic all of a sudden. As if you are leaving Vienna for good. - I'm going home tonight. - With your girlfriend? She doesn't want to see me. She gave me a fake number. A fake number? It was all zeros. That's very good. That's deep feeling. A little passion? Zero stands for passion? Karl! Fight! Fight. VIENNA OPERA TOSCA - DECEMBER 16 What am I doing here? - Cheese or meat? - Cheese. Guys, I'm not leaving. - What about Christmas? - I'll be home, I promise! Is this seat taken? My dear lady... Why so formal? You are off duty. I am always at your service, my dear lady. Franziska. Or Fanny, if you would prefer. Well... if I get to choose, then... Fanny. What brings you here, if I may ask? A young German man reminded me of my own words of wisdom.
