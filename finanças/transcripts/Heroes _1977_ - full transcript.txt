Imagine the loudest thunder you ever heard. Now imagine it six feet from your ear. That's close to the sound of artillery. Most artillery men will tell you that the first few times they fired the big guns, they were shaking. Do you really want to get your heart to start beating? Man, you wait for your first jump. It's sensational. It is better than sex. You guys save your enlistment money, you can buy yourselves a car, the frauleins'll be all over you. You'll just have a wonderful time. You join the Army, the Army'll help you. I just want to say, I think this man is a liar, you know what I mean? Hey. I think you should start a rock band. - Chase girls. - Move it out. Don't I know what I'm talking about? - Let's go. - Let me tell you something. I've been in combat longer than he's had time to pull his pecker. Yeah, I got your combat time. I'm going. I just want everybody to come with me. Come on. Just think of me as a doctor. I'm looking out for your health. I am. I know what I'm talking about. I know what I'm talking about. Just go home. Come on. I'm not kidding. - The war is not... - Call the cops. War is not healthy. Give me a hand with this guy. Get off me. - Wait a minute. - Let go. I just want to help them, that's all. I know what I'm talking about. I was there... I'm not kidding. Go home. You'll be safer. Get him out of here. Take these things off me. I'm not finished yet. You don't understand. Sarge, don't take them. They're all messed up. They don't know what they're doing. Give them a break. I have to catch a bus. Hey. Guess who's back? You know, Jack, you've been in and out of here four times already. Somehow you always manage to be brought back. I don't think you really like it out there. Do you? Tell me, what happened with your job? I'm sure I told you. I lost it. But I'm not bitter. I have bigger plans. I am a visionary. You mean that worm farm in Eureka? Jack, people have to face up what's real in front of them and not pretend. If you'd just accept reality and not keep butting your head against walls, you wouldn't be here in the first place. Jack? Jack, are you okay? Jack. Jack. Yes, I am. But you don't look so good. No, sir. Carbohydrates. Jockeying a desk. Not enough exercise is gonna punch your heart out. Listen, Doc, let's take a break, huh? There's a health food store across the street, you know. Your treat? What do you say? You never, never give up, do you? Can I go see my buddies? Ta-da. Huh? Right here. - Hey, where's your 'stache? - Let's get started. Come on, man, hand it over. Oh, I don't know. What do you mean, you don't know? You stole it for this occasion. I don't know. - Hey, hand it over. - Now you know. - Here we go. - Thank you, my man. Let's get it on. You know, gentlemen, in our society, it takes a very long time to become a doctor. Yes, indeed, got all those boring classes. Autopsies. You have no social life whatsoever. But in my case, in my case, gentlemen, a little perseverance, dedication, a very cunning mind, a quick change of clothing, and in one moment, gentlemen of ward seven, greet Dr Jack. Hey, you guys. You got to keep it down. This place is lousy with doctors. Nate, you need an enema. All right. This is disgraceful dirty linen. Get rid of it. How can you let this plant grow in your ward? This plant needs medication right now. Is that for me? - That's for you. - All right. Okay. Take it easy. I'll see you. - Hey, listen. - Yeah. The fellas asked me to give you this. Thanks very much. I can really use a wallet. That's real great. What'd you guys get rich on disability or something? Nah, we just want to be your partners, man. Hey, I don't need any more partners. Thanks a lot. What'd I tell you guys? Look, I can't take that. God damn it, Jack. All we want to do is work. This is our investment in your business. Forget it. Forget it? Man, that's what everybody's saying, "Forget it." Have you been upstairs? They got guys from one, no, two wars back. And all they do is just stare out the window, because everybody's telling them to forget it. Are you in on this, too? They're all in it. I'm even in it. Look, I don't think you understand. See, I can't take it. I can't just make up a decision on my own. I have a partner, Munro, see. So ask him. You think he's gonna say no? How the hell do I know? Okay, look. If I say you're in, you're in. You're in. And... You guys feel sorry for yourself one minute and you're gonna wheel the 3,000 miles right back here, you understand? You mean, we're in? Yeah. Everybody but you. Don't get caught this time, man. Yeah. I'll try not to. See you in Eureka, man. Yeah. Keep your attitudes in check, huh? Do me a favour. Think about taking a shower. All right, all right, man. Dr Henry Mark, three-seven-three-one. Dr Henry Mark, three-seven-three-one. So now I'm faced with another problem. They need secobarbital and I can't get it. Supply keeps it locked up in there. It's like Fort Knox. It's ridiculous. You fill out a prescription and you can't get it, so what good are you? Yeah. Then the mother comes into the room, and she says to me, "What're you gonna do about my son?" A hospital's like a business. I suggest we steal it. We what? Organise a little party, search and destroy. Steal it. Oh, come on, man. It's a good bet. A sure thing. Big Wing Dig, fourth at Aqueduct, I'll place the bet myself. What do you say? Excuse me, gentlemen. Do you have any idea what you're doing here? Do you know where people have to go through to get here? The bad neighbourhoods, the cab fare and then they run into you two guys checking out the ponies. - It's not right. - Hey, wait a minute. - Hold that man. He's a patient. - Forget what I said. Grab him. Grab him. Grab him. Grab that guy. Hey, hold this. Stop that guy in the white coat. Get him. Get that guy. Hold it. Hold the door. Hold the door. - You got to go around. - Hold the door. No, listen. Good. Hello. - Listen. You make house calls? - You're crazy. - Listen. I got a pain. - Let go of me. It's a dull pain. Right in here. Listen. Wait a minute, Doctor. Doctor. Doctor. I think you're crazy. Check me. Check me into the hospital. Please. Right there. There. Here. I can't. I got to get my bag. He's got a hostage. Please. There he goes. Hey, yo. Look. Hey, you son of a bitch. You ruined my paint job. There he goes. Straight ahead. There he goes. What're they doing? Oh, my God. - Madam, madam. - Hey. I'm just helping you out for 30 seconds. What are you doing? This is my bag. I'm your good deed for the day. Don't do me any favours. Okay, I got it. - Oh, jeez. - Look. Your apple. - God. - All right, I owe you one. You owe me one? Well, jeez. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Oh, God. Now, wait, wait, don't step on my things. Don't step on my things. I want to get to Sedalia, Missouri, Albuquerque, New Mexico, and end up in Eureka, California. - Can I do that? - Yes, you can. For $87.55? No, you can't. Last month, you could've on our special.

Besides, this gentleman just purchased the final ticket. I can't wait around for the next departure. If you planned your time properly, you might've gotten on. I have planned my time very, very... Learn to plan. Wait a minute. That's no way to act. Now, I'll give this lady my seat, and then I'll just sit on the floor. We don't allow that. Well, do you allow a little overbooking? How about it? A life of crime? Yeah, now, ticket first, sport. We have a bus to catch. Okay, shut it off. Hold it. Hold it. Don't hurry, miss. Take your time. Take your time. We got plenty of time.

Going to Omaha. Look out there. Cumulus. That's why I'm going to Omaha. For the weather? Gonna be the TV weather man there. I know what you're thinking. That this fool doesn't have a chance with all those cute, young weather girls. That's what you're thinking. But I have a gimmick. A foolproof, top line gimmick. Here she is. Oh, so good to get out of there. This is little Leona. I'm your fair weather friend, honey. Sunny and warm today, possibility of showers tomorrow. And the barometer is steady. See? It gets attention every time. Me and little Leona are going to the top. Can I try that? Oh, let him try. Sure. Oh, he's got warm hands. Hello. Good. Good. Oh, Mel. Mel. You're just adorable, Mel. Can I come up there and hang out for awhile? You're not supposed to talk to the bus driver while he's driving. Well, I don't want to talk, if you know what I mean. Hey, buddy, you can't sit in the aisle. Now go find yourself a seat. Hey, listen, everybody. Why don't we all say hello to Mel? Okay? On the count of three. A big cheer for Mel for driving this bus so well. One, two, three. Hello, Mel. Oh, yeah. Mel. You're getting to be a real pain in the... You're getting to be a disturbance, you know that? Mel, you're a grump. Hello. Yoo-hoo. Lady with the blue pen. Oh, delicate flower writing with the blue pen. Hello. Oh, I want to introduce you to a very good friend of mine. I think he's real cute. His name is Jack Dunne. Yeah. How come you never smile? You look like you're under the weather. I'm a weather girl, you know. You look like you have a cloud right down your eyelid. You need stars in your eyes and a rainbow in your heart. Rainbow, rainbow show yourself. I'll give you a rainbow. I promise. This is going on your record, big M. Mr Mel. Oh, my God. How long do you think this is gonna take? Lady, please, will you and your friend leave me alone? Hey. Pardon me. The bus driver thinks we're travelling together. What're you doing? We are travelling together. Yes, I know. But he seems to think that we're very friendly and... We know different than that, huh? Well, yeah. The point is, he's getting very annoyed at you, and I'm afraid that if he puts the two... - It's the badges. - What? He has a lot of badges and they bother me. That's the other thing. I... Well, I couldn't help but notice, when we were at that station, You were with the policeman, and... Look, I don't know what's your problem or what you're running away from, but I don't want to be involved with you and thrown off the bus, you know? Because then you can't get to Kansas City, right? Why are you doing that? Why are you going to Kansas City? It's none of your business. I'm vibrating the earth. Why? Are you in love? Yes. I'm going to be married. - When? - Sunday. Oh, that's so close. Aren't you excited? - Yes. - Is he in Kansas City? No. New York. I don't get that. - You don't? - No. Well, I don't get that. I mean, you're going to Kansas City, he's in New York. What does vibrating the earth do? It calls up the night crawlers. They respond to sound. - They do? - Yeah. What are they? Worms. Worms? The guy is in New York City... You set that thing in the dirt and wiggled it back and forth because you're calling up worms? Yeah. Well, that's one method. I mean, there are others. Suzanne. Cecil.

Are you okay? Sure. Gosh, you can't see a thing out there. You most certainly can. Just look. At what? Look. They're coming up. That right there is your typical Pennsylvania family, it's true. Is it? Do you know what the most interesting part of travelling in this section of the country is that they never go anywhere in automobiles. - Really? - They go everywhere in postcards. It's true. And look at this. No pollution. - Oh. - Better than the real thing. Smell that fresh air. Take a whiff. - I don't sniff cards. - Take a whiff. Don't you feel terrific? I don't think I got enough. Anybody else want a whiff? - All right... - There's people asleep. Can I sit with you? I don't care. Sure. I'll save us some seats. Hi. It's me. Oh. Fine. I love you, too.

Actually, I'm on my way to Kansas City. We all stopped here, so we're all getting something to eat. All of us on the bus. The bus. Because I didn't want to get to Kansas City, I just wanted to be going there. A little strange. I just thought it would be a good way to be alone and just sit and stare out the window. Oh, I'll be back. It's four days until Sunday. Our wedding's important to me, too. And then we have all the days after we get married to be together. No. No, don't tell her. Mum thinks I...

Could I borrow a dime? What're you gonna do, call your office? No, my stock broker. I just got off the phone with the ace of diamonds. Who? Kenny. He's a friend of mine. He's gonna pick me up at the next stop in Missouri. Who's Kenny? He's one of my partners. There's Munro, Kenny, Adcox, me. - All worm moguls? - Yeah. Oh, Mel, would you be so kind as to flip me one of those jelly bellies down here? Mel, you're gonna eat both of them yourself? You're gonna get fat... ter. Hi. I'm Marie. Can I take your order? I'll have a chef's salad and a glass of milk. And you? Yeah, I'll... He'll have a chef's salad and a glass of milk. Right. How much have you got in there? A thousand dollars. You made that with worms? Want another partner? No. It doesn't belong to me. It belongs to my investors at ward seven, at the hospital. Sick investors? Who else would invest money in worms? Wait a minute. They're not sick. They're real guys. They're walking around. Well, one of them, and they're normal. They're my friends and they are partners. Thank you. We're going into a multi-million dollar business. Munro says that in fishing alone... I don't fish. All right, do you know what they use worms for in Japan? Garbage. They eat garbage. If we can introduce worms in this country as sanitation engineers, we... The sky's the limit. Munro says that there are... Who's this Munro? The worm expert? Yeah. Munro knows worms. Kenny, the guy I just called, he knows rabbit waste, which is what worms like. Adcox knows money and research, advertising, stuff like that. What do you know? I know what I want. I want to start a worm farm with the guys that I fought with. I want two chocolate cream pies and two cups of coffee, please. Let me tell you. Look. The Helodrilus foetidus is an incredible worm. It has 10 hearts. You were actually there? You fought in the war? I have... There are about three thousand classifications of worms, you know. I only have two classifications in here. What I'm looking for now is a Lumbricus rubellus. How long were you there? Did you have a long stay? Here it is, Lumbricus rubellus. Quite a worm, huh? Look at that. Good reproducers, this worm. The war was terrible. It went on forever. You know why? Because half of it is male and the other half is female. That's very healthy, isn't it? I was against the war. I protested it. And I fought it. Pies. Thanks, Marie. This is terrible. Tastes like there's all preservatives in here. Mel, don't eat this. It tastes like it's made from old bus. A Helodrilus foetidus. Oh, shit. All right, all right, don't move. Don't move. I'll get my worm. - You God dammed trouble maker. - I'm not that kind of guy. Okay, you better have a pretty good reason for giving me indigestion. - That son of a bitch is crazy. - I am not. Hey, this guy's putting worms in my restaurant. You put additives in the pie. But there's worms all over the floor. That's it, buddy. Going to rip his arm off. Now, now, think there's no reason to fight. There's really absolutely no reason. Don't touch her like that. Don't touch her. Grab that guy. Get him. Get him. Get that son of a bitch. You're gonna have to pay for this mess, lady. I mean, this machine here, cost me two hundred bucks. Now you throw in all the broken glass and the cases, I mean, let's just call it three bills. And you're getting off cheap. $300? You're getting off easy. You better find your old man, lady. He's not my old man. Well, who's gonna pay for this stuff? Make her pay. She's the one who broke everything. Hey, look. This wasn't my fault. Listen, honey.

With the big boys? Yeah, those are tanks. And Adcox was out there with those two guys that got blown up so bad they just disappeared right in front of his face, and he starts screaming, "Save us, Howard. Save us, Howard." You remember that? Who was Howard? Our Father, who art in heaven, Howard, be thy name. For a college boy, he weren't too bright. I don't think that's very funny. Well, honey, you had to be there at the time. I'm telling you, it's four years ago and I'm still playing catch up. Come on, buddy. I want to show you something. I'll be right back. Okay? I want to introduce you to an old friend. You lock her up in the trunk? It ain't a she, buddy. - It's an it. - Jesus, man. Where did you get that implement of destruction? Didn't you have enough? Sometimes it just makes me feel good. Where you going now? Don't point that thing at me. - I ain't... - No clip in it, you jerk. What're you gonna shoot at here in the dark? - I don't know. - Do you have any idea what they're gonna do with you once they find out you got that thing? They ain't gonna do nothing to me, man, because first of all, there ain't nobody around out here. And second of all, I'm a veteran. - Here. Shoot it. - You believe that? - I don't want it. - Come on. Government spent all that money teaching you a skill, use it. Kenny, I don't want it. Man. This sucker'll hit the stars. Pick out a star, any star. - That one just to the middle. - That one? - Say bye-bye. - Bye. Did I miss? What are you doing? Firing. Well, stop it. Huh? I said stop it, okay? You seeing anybody? What do you mean? Girls. No, man. I just tune out. Nights are the worst. Oh, God damn it. - What? - It's the carburettor. My primaries are fine, but the secondaries are all screwed up. It affects the timing. Get away from my car. Hey, Kenny, you in the next heat? I mean, you really gonna race this? Yeah. Trade it in for some rabbits. Why don't you guys just take a hike? All right? Just leave him alone. Your friend got some kind of bug up his ass or something? Hey, hey, hey. Hey, lighten up, fella. Hey, lighten up. We just wanna know if Kenny's gonna run, that's all. Yeah, he's gonna run it. He's gonna win it. Let me tell you something. He is gonna put tire tracks over your blond face. I don't know. Gee, he's not gonna run. Get away. Just go piss on a wall, all right? Kenny. Kenny. - Hey, what's the problem? - Wait a minute. Kenny, what is going on here? I'm not gonna run today. I don't... I don't understand. What's... What are you doing? What do you call these? - It's a fire suit. - I'm putting on my fire suit. What are you doing? - I'm gonna race the car. - Do you know how to race? You just can't get in a car and race it like that. Like hell I can't. I'll just go around in a circle. It's not that easy, Jack. It's got to be dangerous. You can't do something like that. Just tell me, who's your next of kin? There aren't any. All right. Come here. Come here. Now, tell me. What do I do? Well, okay. First thing around is gonna be the parade lap. Everybody's got to stay in their place. Second time around, they give you a flag. And you go for it. Just look for a hole and go for it. When you're on a straight away, you stay up high. In the groove. Then when you come around to the curves, you dive in low for the infield. Stay right into that as close as you can to that white line. Okay. Okay. Now, when I go straight away, I go up? - Up high. - Okay. And when I go around, I come down. Low and inside. - Yeah. - Okay. I got the helmet, gloves. Okay. Put down the hood. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Will you come over here? How do I turn it on? Right here. Thank you. Say bye-bye. Bye-bye. Good day, fans. This is the fifth and final heat of the day. Gee, your feet reach the pedals. Imagine that. Ford in the 03 car. Second row, car number 92, Danny Olson. On the outside, number 55, Dick Speaks. Car number three, on the pole, is the 01 car, Artie Herferd. Hey, look at this. We got a surprise for you folks, today. The Ace car, star of the pits for the last weeks, is finally gonna race. 04, pole side, car number 99, Pat Dean. Outside, Terry Armstrong. 05, the Brody brothers, and in sixth, the boys from Arkansas. We're on the parade lap. Setting the pace is Artie Herferd. By the way, we got a new boy in the Ace car, his name is Jack Dunne. He'll be all right. I know. On the fourth turn, a good lap, starting to pick up speed. There goes the green flag, and we're racing. 01 car, Artie Herferd, pole car drops into the second place. Look at this. The Ace car, up through the middle of a sandwich, taken over fourth position. Number 92 car gives him a tap. Now the Ace car is spinning. In front, the I3 car. Back on the track, the Ace car is running. Oh, he made it. Now and for the first place... Come on. Real hard now. The Ace car is moving up through the pack. Passing number 92, Danny Olson. He's really finding the groove and he's closing in. Come on. Here comes the Ace car through the middle, the hard way. I did it. I can't believe it. He takes over the lead. Boy, he didn't learn that in no hospital. The 01 car, Artie Herferd, starting to move on the leader. He goes on the outside. He's got it. He takes over the lead. Right behind him... Get out of here. Get out of here. He drops in on the pole side and he gets by the Ace. They're now running one and two, the Ace car back in third. On the final lap, turn four... The chequered flag. The winner, 01, second 03, and the Ace car finishes third. He didn't win it. Yeah. I don't care. He didn't die. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. The reason that I lost is because I'm a lousy driver. Now, let me tell you something. I'm dying to hear it. The reason that you lost, is because you didn't want to win that money, so that I could go back to New York. No. Wrong. He lost because he's a lousy driver. You are nuts. How am I gonna get back to New York? You know I live in New York? You do? Why don't you live in the big house? Oh, my grandparents live in the big house. I lived there when I was a kid. But we don't get on much any more. They want me to work this place. They wanted my daddy to work this place, too. He split, went to Detroit. I think he might work on the line that Camaro come off. You know what I think? I think if he doesn't do it, I will. Get myself a real hammer. There's a board hanging down here. Just put the board up. Put a nail in it. That sucker is up. I think this man is heavily into an idea. Everybody grab a nail. - We'll have hutches by morning. - Grab myself a nail, and a little hammer. If you're gonna do it, do it right. Hey, it's done right. It's up. You just take the nail and split the board. Hey, I got one in. Fine. You know so much, it should've been done. Here, a little more. Okay. In. Open and close and that sucker is done. Look at what we did. Look. I see. I see. I know. Careful. Here. Hey, a little manpower. Woman power. Good going. I'm ready, you don't have to tell me again. A lot of people you know are counting on you, you know? I know, buddy. Hey, Pappy, you get the stuff for that drill for this afternoon. Okay. We'll be looking for you. - Okay. - Nice to see you. See you later. You know we're gonna need a ride to the depot, right? - Going up to see Adcox, huh? - Yeah. Boy, he's gonna be so surprised. How do you suppose you're gonna get the money for tickets? I need the money back I gave you. Oh. Well, I hadn't really grown attached to it, anyway. Hey, Jack. Here. What's this? The car. Oh, come on, I can hardly drive it. No, man. I want you to take it. I don't really want it right now. Come off it. I'll get it back from you in Eureka. - Better than the bus. - Yeah. Want your foot? No, you keep it for luck. I will do that. Keep her off the main roads, buddy. - Drive carefully. - Yeah. Bye. You know, when things start cooking, he's just gonna shape up and join us, you know. That guy's never gonna leave that town. You know that. You're wrong. You know, I was thinking. If Adcox doesn't give me the money, I'll just take it out of my partner's fund. And get you back to New York in time. Okay? What are you, my travel agent? Don't make my plans for me. Why were you in the hospital? Because I lost my head and they gave me a new one. I wasn't always this attractive, you know. Why were you in the hospital? Bridge work. See how the Brooklyn Bridge connects the two molars. Why were you in the hospital? Because I am supposed to be crazy. Jack, would you do me a big, big favour. Sure, what? Would you let me drive the car? - Are you kidding? - No, I'm not kidding. - You think you can handle this? - I don't know. Let me try. Good for a cheap thrill. I don't have the slightest idea why I'm doing this but I have a feeling I'm gonna regret it. No you won't. It's a very good move. Wait a minute. Let me get... Wait a minute Let me get a seatbelt on. Peanuts, will you knock it off? We're playing for money here. We got families, too, you know. You don't have any family. I might have, if I hadn't spent five years in that dump. Shut up. - Hi. - Hi. Be with you in a minute. They ain't got no right to lay us off like that. Shit. Thank you, good buddy. What'll it be? Do you have any celery tonic? You want it to go or are you gonna drink it here? No, no. Beer, wine. - Seltzer water? - Ginger ale. - Ginger ale. - You got it. Hey. - You get those pants in the Army? - No. I was in the Army. - Great. - Yeah. - You in the Army? - Yeah. Yeah? See any action? Peanuts, here, is always bragging about those gook broads. I prefer home-grown, myself. How about you? Hey, that broad out there in the lobby, she yours? Jack. I got us a key to a room. You folks taking a room for the night, are ya? Maybe by the hour, huh? Looks to me like he'd just last about 10 minutes, old buddy. Thanks. Let's get out of here. Have fun. Okay? - Class. - Yeah. I'm gonna take a shower. Hi, boys and girls. You hungry? What? Carol, could I shave? - When? - Now. You could just turn the other way. Well, I will if you will. Yeah. You know, this is the most sophisticated thing I've ever done in my whole life, or it's exactly like the hospital. What? The... In the hospital. - Hey. - Yeah. Would you hand me a towel? Yeah. Oh, thanks. Yeah, I mean, in the hospital, you shower, shave, pee pee together, all in the same room, you know, but... Just never like this. Excuse me. I'll bet these guys are hungry. What? - I'll bet they're hungry. - Ah. Plastic. Yeah. One false move and I'll shoot. Carol, can I talk to you for a minute? Yeah. Carol, I really have to ask you a question. What? Are we going to... Are we going to what? You know. No. There's only one bed, so... Oh. I don't know. The reason I ask is... I've been in the... I haven't... What? I haven't been with a lady in a long, long time. Are you all right? Yeah. Aren't you uncomfortable? - No. - No? Well... I... What do you think I am, some great big expert or something? Can I give you a kiss? Yes. Want another one? - Do you? - Yeah. You don't look like you do. Look at you. You're all in a knot. Come on. Let's get comfortable. Put your legs out. Put your shoulders down. Let... What's that? It's my scar. I was with General Custer, you know, and this arrow just came out of the sky and went... Will you be serious? I'm too nervous to be serious. You are? Yeah. Well, I'm nervous, too. - Yeah? - Yeah. Nervous is nice. - What's the matter? - I have to go for a walk. I like you. I... I really have to go for a walk. Thank you kindly, brother. Jack, is that you? Jack. I really like you, too. Oh, Jack. What's the matter? They took my money. You wait right here. I'm gonna call the police. No. I'll take care of it myself. - Okay? - Okay. Okay. You shoot pool? I'm talking to you, spit head. You look very, very unhappy to me. I was rolled. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. It's a rough neighbourhood. Get my friend a beer. On me. No, on me. On you? On you. I want my money. What was that? I want my money. I don't have your money. But do me a favour, okay? Don't get tough. These guys are monsters. They'll kill you in a minute. Maybe. - But in 30 seconds, - It's all right. I'm gonna shove my palm up your nose and it's gonna enter your brain two inches, and you're gonna die from cerebral haemorrhage in 30 seconds, that's one half minute. Are you serious? Peanuts, get over here. Give this man his money. I don't have his money. Fifteen seconds. Give him the money. Now. All right, now take it easy. Get out of here. Take it easy. Take it easy. Take it easy. He's a little crazy. Okay? It was a joke. Not funny, I admit, but a joke. I apologise. I run a clean joint. You're a hot head. I'm sorry. Really. All there? Is it all there? Give me a bottle. Get out of here. Leave him alone. Go on, swing the God damn lamp. Come out punching. Go on, swing it. This son of a bitch is mine. Mine. Back out. Back out. Here we go. Pulling up as close as you can to a front door is not driving through a wall. Well, I'm new at combat. - Carol, you were terrific. - I was? Yeah. You were terrific. - Really? - Yeah. Are you all right? No. My head hurts. Would you drive? Sure. - Yes. - Pardon me. Is this the Adcox residence? Yes. Is Mr Adcox in? No, but I'm his wife. Well, I'm a friend. Do you know Jack Dunne? No, I don't think so. Jack Dunne. Jungle Jack. The worm squad. Oh, yes. I remember. - Come on in. - Thank you. Do you happen to know when your husband will be home? Got me. Abe, you go play in there with your sister, okay? That a boy. Sit down. Thank you. Could I ask where he is? I don't know. It's a while since he's been here. I'm sorry. Oh, it's okay. He's done it before. I used to think it was me, but now I don't think so. He drifts. I wonder if I should tell Jack. Where's he? He's in the car, asleep. Oh, why don't you wake him up and I'll make you both some breakfast? Oh, no, no, really. It's not necessary. I think we should just be getting to Munro's. Munro. Now there's a name I remember. How long have you and Jungle Jack been married? Oh, we're not married. We're... I don't know what we are. I understand. You do? Jeez, I wish I did. Look, can I use your telephone? I have to make a long distance call. It's to New York, but I'd be glad to pay for any charges. Sure, use the one over there. Thanks. Come on, kids. Go on back in with me, okay? Joel? Promise you won't tell me you love me. Because I have something to say to you, and... I can't say it to you if you say you love me. No, I'm not home. I know. I know the wedding is today. I guess that's why I'm not home. Joel, I can't... I can't marry you. I don't know why. I just can't. Oh, God. It would be so much easier if I just went through with it, you know? If I just was your happy little wife. But it's just not right. Not for me. Not for you. Joel? I know. I know you want to understand. God, you're always so good at understanding. I have to get off the phone now. I will. I love you, too. I really do. Thank you. You okay? Sure. Are you? I will be. My name's Jane. I'm Carol. Hiya, worm head. Hello. Licence and registration, please. Licence. Let's see. It's a friend's car. What happened to him? He's okay. He's asleep. Let me see his ID. One moment. That's it. Okay. You get this car to a garage. There's one about a mile up ahead. Yeah. Sure will. Is that it? Quit while you're ahead. I don't get it. Carol. Carol, do you have any idea how to read a map? We passed Adcox. Adcox went out for a beer and hasn't been home since. How do you know that? We were there. - Come on, let's go. - Where? Back to Adcox. Why? Why? Because he's my partner, that's why. I think the car was in an accident. A motel hit it. You coming? - Back to Adcox? - Yeah. That's stupid. It's not stupid. He's my partner. I can't just pass him by. He passed you by. Want some help? You need a lift? - Yeah. - Where are you going? New York. - I'm your guy. - I doubt it. Give me a chance. Over here. Yeah, I used to fool around when I was your age, you know. But I'm settled in now. You settled in? Why don't we give that guy a lift? Come on, I got a hitch-hiker. Yeah, I know, but he gave me a ride a ways back and he's really a nice guy. We can't just leave him standing in the middle of the road. We have to show some charity. Want a lift? I'm going the other way. So am I. Turn around first. Go on. Thanks. - What is this? - You got me. Will you get in this car? Maybe we'll both get lucky. It won't do you any good to go back to Adcox' house. - What do you care? - I care. Say, do you think we could talk about something the three of us could get in on? I'm open to anything, you know. You're changing everything. First Ken, then Adcox. What did you do back there? I just talked to his wife. And what did you tell her? How much did you tell her? What happens if she sends out the cops? Cops? Nobody's gonna call the cops. Nobody's after you. The only one that's chasing you is you. I'm on your side. Yeah? What about Joel? - What about him? - What about him? What about tomorrow? What about your wedding? Today is Sunday, you cluck. I blew it. Where are you going? Well, I don't know about you, but I was thinking about going to Eureka. Hot dog. I think you're going in the wrong direction. How're we gonna get there? We'll get there. - God. I can't make it. - Yes, you can. You know, I was just thinking. Would you do me a favour? Hold onto this pouch for me. Why? In case something happens to me. What if something happens to me? Good point. Oh, please, baby. Put your thumb out. Oh, hallelujah. Oh, my feet. You kidding me? What is that, a joke? - Where's the number? - Right there, 151. 151. We're here. We did it. We're here. Wait. Jack. Jack. Want me to come up there with you? Yeah. Of course. Come on. We're on our way up here. Well, wait for me. Come on. Give me that. We did it. Oh, goodness, we're gonna have the best legs in town. Your box. I can't believe... Mrs Munro? Yes. Mrs Munro, Jack Dunne. Who? Jack Dunne. Larry's friend, Jungle Jack. Oh, of course, Jack Dunne. Larry told us all about you. Come in. - Please come in. - Thank you. Darling, we have company. Sweetheart. This is Jack Dunne, Larry's friend from the Army. - Hi. - Jack Dunne. - And... - Carol Bell. - Oh, hello, Carol. - Hello, nice to meet you. - How are you? - Sir, nice to see you. Would you like to sit down? Oh, yes. Wow. It was just like he told me. You guys, too. Can we get you something? A cup of coffee would be really nice. - How about you? - No. You look tired. I'll tell you, the last... What is it been? Two or three days... - Is he here? - Who? - Your son, Larry. - Larry? King Lawrence. Larry was killed over four years ago in Vietnam. No, he's not. I buried him. Who are you people? I was hit, he pulled me out. He was hit. We were medevaced out together. See? He's okay. I'm okay. He's my friend. He was my son. What do you want? Why are you here? Haven't we already given enough? Do you know who I'm talking about? Please, leave. - Do you know what I mean? - Please. I don't even think you know who I'm talking about. Jack, Jack, don't, please. The Distinguished Service Cross. The second highest award. He got that for saving four of his buddies. I was one of them. Can't you see? I'm in the picture. I'm in the picture. I'm looking for Larry Munro. - Give me that. - Don't touch me. Please, get out of my house. Look. Just have him call me when he gets in. That's all. I'm sorry. Oh, my God. Jack. Jack. Jack. Jack. Jack. Jack, get out of here. Come on, Jack, hustle. Let's go. Jack. Jack. Jack. Munro, you all right? You show off. Why couldn't you stay up in the helicopter? I can take care of myself. Oh, why did you jump out? Jack. Jack, listen to me. It's not happening now. - It's not happening. Jack. - No. Jack, stop it. Listen to me. Listen to me. - The worm farm... - Jack. Listen to me. It's not happening, now. It's not happening now. Jack, it's not happening. It's all over. It's all over. He's dead. He's dead. Listen to me. Listen to me. Jack. Listen to me. Listen. You're alive. Oh, Jack, please don't be crazy. If you're crazy, I can't have you. Please don't be crazy, Jack. Please, please, don't leave me. Please, don't be crazy. You're alive. You're alive. You don't need Munro. You don't need anybody but you. And you have me. And I'm right here, and I'm right now. Jack, I'm right here. Hold onto me. I'm now. Don't leave me. You're okay. You're okay.
