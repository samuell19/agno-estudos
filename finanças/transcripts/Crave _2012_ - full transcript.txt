We got a blood trail suggesting a struggle with the perp on the way down. Victim has enough fight in him to go for the meth or the .38, or the meth and the .38. Perp gets freaked out by an unexpected witness, makes a run for it, losing his shoe. Kind of feels a little staged, but... I don't think I care right now. All's I know is there's one less junkie out on the streets, and wouldn't it be nice if that .38 matches the ballistics from the coney last week? What do you got there? Uh, yeah, look, um...
