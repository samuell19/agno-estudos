Subtitles: Lu?s Filipe Bernardes Silence! Loring versus Loring, part heard. My lord, I shall continue the evidence of Mr. Carl Dieter. Mr. Carl Dieter. I would remind you, Mr. Dieter, that you are still under oath. Yesterday you told the court that the circumstances... of your first meeting with the respondent. Today there remains only one question that I need ask you. On that occasion, did you or did you not... ...spend the night in your cabin with the respondent, Mrs. Mark Loring? It is a little difficult to explain. Surely, Mr. Dieter. No more difficult than a simple yes... or no. Yes. Thank you. Mrs. Loring, is it a fact that you are now in a state of approaching motherhood? Yes or no, please. - Yes or no. - Yes. You have sworn on oath that Mark Loring... ...has legally been your husband since April 4th, 1955. Yes. Is Mark Loring responsible for this child you carry? He is my husband and would be the child's father. A yes or no answer is what the court requested. Did your husband beget this child? Is your husband the father of the child you now bear? No. Can you tell the court who the father is? No. Because you wish to withhold evidence from the court? Because I don't know. Do you recall the occasion of the Iberian Grand Prix on September 27th? Can we have one of you on the hood of the car, Mrs. Loring? No, no, Mary. Alright, Jimmy, take her away. Buenas tardes, se?ora. Le gust? la carrera? No compreendes? - You do not understand? - No. He's a very hard man to beat, your husband. Yes. Alright, Mary, come on. - Will you sign my book, please, Mr. Loring? - No, not now. Do you have to encourage every greaseman here on the track to make passes at you? Oh, for heaven's sake, Mark! Se?or Loring, please, with your wife. Can't you leave us alone just for five minutes... ...without sticking your blasted camera in our faces? Well, I'm not going to play this scene to an audience. Mary! Not a bad race. Looks as if I might have a chance at the championship this year... ...if I can pick up the Grand Prix at Silverstone. What's the matter? You've hardly spoken to me since the race. Will you please tell me why you pulled that ridiculous jealousy scene? I don't like you talking to strangers you find hanging around the rails, that's all. He was one of the crew in the next pit. - A fan of yours. - Mine? He didn't look like that to me. We were just talking. I like talking to people. I was brought up in show business and we're a friendly crowd. Yes, too darn friendly. Mark. Darling Mark. I wish you could trust me. I love you so much. - You can trust me, you know. - I want to. I really do, Mary. It's just that every time I see some idiot staring at you, I... I see red. Well, I think you should be pleased that people are attracted to your wife. I am. It's when they start circling around you. Darling, that's beyond my control. Come on, zip me up. Of course we could move to a desert island. - That's a great idea. - You wouldn't get much racing, though. Where are you going? Downstairs. Otherwise you'll never get ready and I'm starved. Meet you in the bar, okay? Okay. Buenas noches, se?ora. - Hello. - How nice to see you again. May I offer you an aperitif? Oh, no, thank you, I'm just waiting for my husband - Buenas noches, se?or. - Good evening. - Forgive me. - No, no, don't go. Oh, Marc, darling, this is the gentleman I was telling you about. You were right, darling. It is my autograph he wants. Let's have a drink. There's Mark. That must be his wife. Mark! - Hello. - Won't you join us? Well, thanks, we've already got a table. Oh, we accept no excuses, do we, Claire? Mark, you're caught. Give up and sit down. We're so cross. You've been keeping your charming wife from us far too long. Well, just one drink. Darling, this is Mr. Duncan. We're very old friends of Sir John. I've known Mark since he was a boy. Sir John idolizes Martin. I think he spoiled him. - Yes, I know. - Well, it's not surprising, really. Have you heard about the mother? They parted Marc was only a baby. She just walked out. American. Singer, I believe. - You're American, aren't you? - Yes... and a singer. - It's one of my old songs. - Oh, do sing it. Now, please, won't you? Oh, they've recognized you, my dear. How simply thrilling! Well, you can't refuse now. - You're not going to sing. - Why not? I won't have it. # My strange affair is a lonely one # # A lonely one that's just a dream # # And when the sunshine awakens # # Each weeping willow # # The man I loved is gone # # And there's just my empty pillow. # My strange affair # # Is too full of tears # # Tears that know # # There isn't a chance # # That someday, somehow # # Somewhere, someone # # Will come # # My way # # And change my strange affair # # To a real romance # Oh, I'm sorry. Mary! What are you trying to do to me? What the devil are you trying to do? Blast all the people. Have you been up long, darling? Good morning, darling. Forgive me? For what? Last night. Darling, I don't think I could change you even if I wanted to. Mark, what are you trying to prove? That you're a man? You may have to prove that to your father, but you don't have to prove it to me. Oh, Mary! Hello? It's for you. Yes? Oh... - It's my fan. Oh, you're very kind. Persistent, isn't he? Oh, no, I'm afraid we can't, we're busy. Oh, yes, if you would. Would you please leave it with the barman? Thank you. I dropped my glove at the race. And a handsome stranger who happened to be passing by picked it up. Et cetera, et cetera. Hm, a bit old-fashioned, isn't it? Besides, I don't care to share you this morning. Oh, Mark. I never seem to have you to myself. There's always something. Somebody. Nothing's ever enough for you, Mark. Not even me. We've got to move on, Mary, we're on our way. What? We're leaving. - Where are we going? - London, home. Home. - That's something we don't have. - I mean my father's house in London. My home and yours too. And right now I'm ready to go home. A trophy in one hand and me in the other. Not bad. I hope he hates me a little less this time. - Hate you, he hardly knows you. - He doesn't need to. As far as he's concerned I'm just like your mother. He hated her. A home. You're always talking about a home. It's what you want most in the world, isn't it? Second most. What's the most? Something that's going to happen very soon. Something that makes the second very important. Hm? I'm going to have a baby. Ours, I hope. Mary. Mary, I'm terribly sorry. Se?orita, se?orita! My husband... my husband! Si, si, si... Doctor! Doctor! Si, si, se?ora. Father. Would you mind, sister? Take it easy, boy. Everything's going to be all right now. - I'm here. - Why are you here? The Duncans heard about the crash. They called me. Gently, boy, gently. You were badly hurt. How badly? Badly enough. But we'll soon have you on the mend. I've made arrangements for the convalescent home near London. Can't seem to remember what happened. - Mary? - She's along the corridor. She's not seriously hurt. Thank heavens. She's going to have a baby, Father. What is it? I'm sorry, Mark. Oh, come in, doctor. Good evening, se?ora. Ah, it is a shame. You do not like Spanish cooking. It's just that I'm not hungry. Your husband is conscious. His father is with him. I do not want you out of bed now anyway. It will soon be time enough. - You haven't told him? - About the baby? No, no, about him. There will be time enough for that as well. Couldn't you tell him it was me? Can't you just say... your wife can't have any more children? You could adopt a child. In your circumstances... ...there are many children. You don't know Mark. You will see. You don't understand. Maybe I do. I doubt it. You try to get some sleep. We will talk about it tomorrow. Do you hate me? No. Oh, no. Mary, I've had some time to think. No, no, please listen to me. As soon as I'm out of here, I'll make things up to you. We'll settle down like ordinary people. Have another child. Don't, darling, not now. We'll talk about it all later. Everything's going to be fine. Just fine. Did they tell you something they didn't tell me? - No. - No wheelchairs? No wheelchairs. Am I intruding? One wouldn't accuse you of subtlety, my dear. It's just that Mark and I wanted to be alone. - Had you thought of that? - Constantly. Mary, please. I've got some wonderful plans for you, Mark. We're going to travel. We'll take the yacht. Go to the Far East, or the West Indies. Oh, there's a lot we can do. It's time I took some time off. - Do you mean the two of us? - It's bound to end, sooner or later. - These affairs always do. - This is not an affair. - It's a marriage. - Do you really believe that? Once upon a time I thought that too. And now I have to stand around and watch the thing happening all over again. You're two lovers in the throes of an affair. People can't go through life that way. - Maybe I want to. - That's what you think now. But a man can't want that for very long. Well, I'm going back to London. I'll be waiting for you. In the meantime they'll move you to the convalescent home in the weekend. Goodbye, Mark. Come in. Is this a social call? Oh no, my dear. Just a little private talk. You want to buy me off. Well, I'm not for sale. I never have been. - Perhaps I underestimated you. - Or Mark. Now it's time that you faced facts. You and Mark can never have a real marriage. Not now. He can't have a son, an heir. - And somebody should tell him. - No! He doesn't have to know, not now, it's too soon. Maybe after a while, when he's well again. We just need a little time. - By ourselves. - He belongs with me. You'll only hurt each other. I'll take my chances on that. I'm not worried about you, my dear. - Mark is my only concern. - Mark? Your property, that's all Mark is to you. Just a piece of property, like your ships or your factories. And you try to buy him from me like a piece of real estate. Well, I'm not selling. You haven't got enough love to buy him with. Sir John. Even now your son is more of a man than you'll ever be. At least he's not afraid of a fight. What he doesn't know is that you're the enemy. Thank you, nurse. You see? I promised you sun on your first day out. You also promised me no wheelchairs. Just one more week, darling. Mark. I want a baby. Mary... Mary. Listen to me, please listen to me, darling. While you give me a blueprint of my deficiency? Oh, Mark. They told you. Father did. Your father? - But he didn't have the right to... - That didn't matter! I had to know sometime that the accident has left me sterile. Mary, I can still be a husband to you but... ...now I can't give you a child. If you want to leave me, this is the time. I'd understand. Oh, Mark, how could you? You didn't think me any less a woman when you thought I couldn't have another child. Well, I don't think you any less a man now. But we can have another child, darling. No, no, adopting a child wouldn't work, not for us. We'd just be using it to keep our marriage together. It wouldn't be fair. Well, there's another way. For me to have a child, I mean. What do you mean, I... Artificial insemination. You must be crazy. No, Mark. I'm not crazy. We both want a baby, our own baby. - This is the only possible way. - But I wouldn't be ours. - I wouldn't be the father. - But I'd be the mother. It would be born to us. And if you tried, really tried, it would be your baby just as much as mine. And if I don't agree? Then I don't see any future for us. And only your father will be happy. Let's go away, Mark. As soon as you're well. Away from any outside influence. Then we'll know... ...whatever we decide, it'll will be our own decision. I've heard about a clinic in Switzerland... It's run by a man named Cameron. We could go there... What do you say, Mark? Yes or no? Darling? Yes or no? It'll be your child. It's to be your decision. Schaeffer! Schaeffer, they're here. Dr. Cameron! The new couple have arrived. Our head clerk said gesundheit. Ah, the secret signal. Is Schaeffer pulling up the drawbridge? They like to see an open door when they arrive. It makes them feel much more welcome. - I'll show them to their room. - No, no... don't do that. Bring them in here. - Do you have any coffee? - I've just made some. Good, good. I'm nurse Parsons. Do come in. - Mrs. Loring, how nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, doctor. May I take your coat, Mr. Loring? - Thank you. Directly on time. It isn't always like that down here. Come and sit down, Mr. Loring. I believe there's some coffee on the hob, nurse? Yes, plenty, I'll bring it in. How long are we going to be here, doctor? Quite a little while, several weeks. The doctor explained in his letter, darling. - He did? - There are certain preliminaries. Blood tests and things like that. Then I like to understand the background of the case. It all takes time. Mr. Loring, what's your view about this? We want a baby, very badly. That's the most important thing. Two people must really want the child. The medical treatment is not too complicated. Many children are born every year by the same method. You've got to make sure that the people involved are in good health, there's no question of hereditary diseases, and that they can fully take care of the child. You both obviously understand all about it. Or you wouldn't have come here. - Ah, nurse. - I think I'll go to our room. - You don't want any coffee? - No, thank you. Well... I'm sure your journey was very tiring. Not particularly. We'll meet after dinner and discuss everything then. There's something I want you to know. None of my patients are just cases to me. I regard you as something very special. Both of you. I think you behaved disgustingly. If you want to take it out on anybody, take it out on me, not Dr. Cameron! I can't stand being humored. Coffee on the hob. Comfortable English armchairs. Humph! For boring English backsides. Why the devil did we leave home? To protect you from people, why do you suppose? I don't care about people! Well, what do you care about, your own stupid pride? That's about all it could be! All I'm guilty of is trying to hold this marriage together. I don't know what you want me to do or to say! I have good news for you, Mary. You're going to have a baby. Isn't it wonderful news, Mark? Say it's wonderful, go on, say it. Yes, yes, yes, it's wonderful, it's wonderful. You know what I'd like to do today? I'd love to go right up to the forest slopes. - You'll have to go without me. - On no, Mark, please come. We haven't been there together in so long. Mary, I just don't feel like it. If you want to go, you can go alone. - You can manage without me. - Oh, but I can't. You seem to have done pretty well so far. You idiot! You fool, you stupid, senseless, ridiculous fool! Why do you suppose I did it? Why do you suppose I strained every nerve in my body to make this happen? Because I love you! Whatever kind of a man you are, I love you, I love you! Stay where you are. Don't move. So... Let's see. All right? Uh-huh. You were very lucky. - No pain? - No. Yeah, my ankle... a little bit. Are you... are you with anyone? No. No, I'm alone. Not so good. You know it's a long way back to the hotel with that ankle. Oh, I'm not staying at the hotel. - I'm at Dr. Cameron's. - Oh, I see. - You know him? - Yes, we are old friends. Now, you think you can walk? - Oh, I guess so. - We haven't to go very far. Do you mind telling me where we're going? - My cabin. - Oh, you're not a tourist. No, I, er... I try to write. - Oh. - Now let's see. Isn't Mary back? No... She's probably met some of the skiers. Perhaps at the lodge. Anyhow... please, please... Please stay, I'd like to talk to you. You're angry, very angry. It's because of Mary's present condition, isn't it? - It's none of your blasted business! - It's pretty much my blasted business. I assumed that you wanted this child. I agreed on paper. It's actually your responsibility. I'm afraid there's a little more to it than that. I'm no quack, Mr. Loring. The thing I do, I do with sincerity and humility. - I admire your dedication. - I'm not asking for your admiration. The fact remais that I have already made you a father. You made Mary a mother! Do you have a phone? Oh, no... No, I'm sorry, I... I want to call my husband, I'm afraid he'll be worried. We'll think about that in a moment, hm? First I'll make you some coffee. - You look frozen. - Yes, I am, my clothes are kind of wet. - We will dry them. - Okay. - Here we are. - Thank you. - Behind that curtain. - All right. This will be real coffee, not like the one you drink in America. As long as it's hot. Ah, don't worry. You'll be back. You live here all year round? - Yes. - It must be lonely. No. - Coffee will be ready in a moment. - Good. You know we were lucky, there's a blizzard coming up. I'm afraid I... I can't get you back now. Well how long do you think it will last? Oh, you can't tell with a mountain storm. Sometimes it doesn't last long and... Well? How do I look? Very funny. I'd better have another look, hm? - It's only a muscle. - Good. I'll get a fire started. - Can I help you? - No, no. You rest. Besides, building a fire is a man's job. But it's an art all the same. You know you can tell a man's character by the way he makes a fire? - Didn't you know that? - Really? I will show you. Now. First there is the spendthrift. Very unreliable. Then we have the scientific technique. Beware of such a man. Mean, insensitive. Then we have the, er... the doubter. Well, which sort of man are you? I... I'm the most dangerous of all. I never start a fire twice the same way. Mr. Loring. Mr. Loring! You can't go out without a guide. I'll get you one. Polizei. Schnell, bitte. Cameron here. One of out patients is lost in the mountains. Could you send out a guide immediately? The guide will be here in a few moments, Mr. Loring. Was there a reason for all this solitude? None, except that I like it. It's getting awfully late. You can't go back yet. It's still snowing heavily. The coffee's getting cold. Thank you. It has stopped snowing. I'll take you home now. - Is your ankle all right? - Oh, yes. Good. Better get changed. Thank you. This is Herr Dieter's house. Mark! And I spend the entire night searching for you. It doesn't seem any of this holiday was necessary. You don't seem to understand, she hurt her ankle... Don't insult my intelligence! You are the one who is being insulting. Here... a touch of this. - Has Dieter lived around here long? - Yes. - Let me help you. - You've been enough help already. I'm sorry I've caused you so much trouble, doctor. You seem to have a bigger problem on your hands. Well, you can't blame him too much. It hasn't been easy for him. Everyone knows why we're here. He feels that... he caused it. I guess he feels like some kind of freak. - What are you doing? - Isn't it obvious? - I'm not leaving. - You're not invited. Mark. I won't beg you, but someday you'll realize you're making a terrible mistake. You're going to be a father. No, no, you've got it all wrong. You're going to be a mother. I shall never be the father. It'll be anybody but me. It's a terrible thing we've done to Dr. Cameron... ...making him believe we wanted this child. We wanted the child? You mean you did. Is there something you want to tell me, Mary? I've been very dishonest with you, doctor. I led you to believe that Mark wanted this child too. You thought it would hold you together? Yes, I did. It will, you know. Just give it time. It's too late now. Come in. - You look tired. - I am. Make yourself comfortable. All right. I've left her. So it's happened. Oh, my poor boy. I've been through this. How I wish you could have been spared. - I did try. - Father, what can I do? - Another man? - She's pregnant. - I'm not the father. - That should be enough for any judge. Adultery is quite simple. And um... I think Stanley's our man. He's tough. That's the kind of barrister you want for a case like this. You think I should divorce Mary. - Had you any other thought? - Well... No, no, I... No, of course you're right. - I must divorce her. - Good. I'll arrange for you to see Stanley in the morning and I think I'll come along too. Now listen, my boy. Everybody makes mistakes, even I do. The important thing is to correct them as soon as possible. You do want this divorce, don't you? Yes. There's no going back on a thing like this, you know. I've made up my mind. Of course the press will crucify me, but... Oh, that doesn't worry me. Let's go home. Be like old days, hm? Oh, say? Why don't we have dinner at the club tonight? It's been a long time since we did that. Anything wrong, doctor? Come and sit down, Mary. Your case is down for hearing six weeks from today. Even my medical statement can't postpone this. You could let him have it by default. And have my child branded father unknown? No. No, I want to go to London. Will it harm you in any way? Something was bound to happen eventually. Thank you, Jane. People like the Lorings simply can't be expected to realize the importance of this. They'll fight to secure the money, the blood... They'll build banks for both... ...but a bank to secure humanity. Anyhow, so long as it doesn't harm you. Komm herein. Mary! You're just in time for coffee. You must be getting strong to be so early. - It must be a special occasion. - I had to come early. I want to tell you myself. Karl, I have to leave here. - When are you going? - Today, on the afternoon plane from Zurich. So quickly. - Is it important then? - Yes. Mark's divorcing me. So you're defending the case. Of course. - What did you think? - You're doing it for the child. Because I don't want to lose Mark. You still love him. There's never been any other way. I think Mark still loves me. It's not just him I'm fighting, Karl, it's his father. And what if you lose the case? I don't know. I'll face that when it happens, if it happens. You will face it on your own? In the end everything's faced on one's own. Not always. Goodbye, Karl. Thank you for everything. I've done nothing, except cause trouble for you. I'm afraid there's more to it than that night. I'm sure Mark's probably forgotten all about you by now. Oh, no, he hasn't. I'm also coming to London. Your husband has named me co-respondent. Now then, Mrs. Loring, how many times would you say that you saw Mr. Dieter? Would you say one time... Two times? Three times? - Many times? - Yes. Many times. We became friends. You became friends, is that what you said, Mrs. Loring? Yes. After or before you spent the night with him? - What are you suggesting? - After or before? After. So you became friends that night. - Intimate friends? - Friends, but not intimate. Not in any way? He didn't even kiss you? Not that night or any other night. But you, um... you enjoyed talking to him, I assume. As you did the mechanic Mario Firenzo on the occasion of the Iberian Grand Prix. It was hardly much conversation between Mr. Firenzo and myself. The incident with Mr. Firenzo occurred before your trip to Dr. Cameron, did it not? Incident? What incident? - You met then, before the accident. - Yes, at the racetrack. In the evening you met again. - In the bar at the Hotel Playa. - By arrangement? Why, no! My husband was changing for dinner, so I... And you preferred the bar and Mr. Firenzo to your husband's company. No! I left my husband alone deliberately. He had just driven a hard race, and I left him to unwind. - Had you quarreled? - I'd refused to quarrel with my husband. About Mr. Firenzo? - Yes. - So, knowing that, you preferred the company of this mechanic who couldn't even speak to you. Preferred it enough not to stop and think... that you were placing yourself in a position... ...that your husband could both misconstrue and be offended by. It was so very unimportant. Did you explain or apologize to your husband? Apologize? No, I just laughed it away. - You laughed it away? - No... I mean... - I quite understand. - No, I don't think you do! I assure you, Mrs. Loring, your meaning couldn't be clearer. - But we both... - Please, Mrs. Loring. So after the accident, when you decided that the only way to save your marriage was by having a child, you quite naturally didn't consider your husband's feelings in the matter. My husband's feelings were my main consideration. Your main consideration. There were others then. Possibly you considered the child might be a guarantee for your future. My future? I don't see... What do you mean? Were you aware of your husband's great family wealth? Yes. Were you equally aware of your father-in-law's disapproval of you? Yes, I was. Knowing that, it might have occurred to you that your future was most insecure... unless you could produce an heir... ...and as such an heir was no longer possible, you were obliged to force your husband... to do something that was against all his wishes in a last frantic hope... My lord! You were about to ask a question, Mr. Stanley? I was simply thinking aloud, my lord. Unwise, Mr. Stanley. Most of our private thoughts are best left unsaid. I know from up here most of mine are. Forgive me, my lord. Now answer me this question, Mrs. Loring. Were you as decided and as desperate to have this baby... ...before the accident as you were after the accident? I always believed a child was necessary to our marriage. - Always! - Necessary, why? My husband... ...was never very sure of himself. It was very important... ...for him to be a man. That's why I was so happy when I knew we were going to have a child. Then there was the accident... ...and we lost our baby. After the accident... I thought another child might... ...compensate. I find it difficult to follow your reasoning. How could you possibly compensate your husband with somebody else's child? Because I'm part of my husband. A child is part of me. So I thought... The idea is rather high-flown, isn't it? I suggest that your reason for producing this child... ...was on a far more material basis. All I want... All I have ever wanted is my husband's love. Nothing else is of any importance. Stop the examination! Look at her. He wants you to stop the examination. My lord, Mrs. Loring is under very great physical strain. My lord, the jury and I, and doubtless your lordship, have been admiring the respondent's performance. The theatrical profession has lost a talented actress. Anything after this would be an anticlimax. All I have left to say is... Thank you, Mrs. Loring. Um, my lord, if it would please the court, I would like to ask for a short adjournment on behalf of my client. Yes... yes, I shall rise for fifteen minutes. Mark, I can't stand any more. It's too horrible. I'd say give in now... ...if I thought that that was what you really wanted. I'm not going to put you in the witness box again. The jury are with you, emotionally, I mean. But I must have something more factual to give the judge. You must give me permission to reexamine your husband. - Oh, what good would it do? - What good? There are two vital points I can establish. And this I must do if you are to have any chance at all of winning this case. I don't think I care anymore. Does it really matter what you care, Mrs. Loring? Have you the right to deliberately bastardize your child? Thank you. In fact, Mr. Loring, you have been jealous of your wife since the day of your marriage. I didn't enjoy the attentions my wife encouraged, if that's what you mean. No, that is not what I mean. You did not enjoy them, or were you jealous of them? I did not like them. Because you wanted to be the only man she was aware of? Naturally. She was my wife. Is your wife, Mr. Loring. You may have arrived at your own verdict, the court has not. So we have established... ...that you did not like your wife being civil to Mario Firenza, you did not like her accepting a light from your father's old friend, Mr. Duncan... I consider she was provoking him. We've already gone into that. I am merely summarizing the points we have established about your likes and dislikes. You did not like her singing in a night club. No, I did not. And you did not like her accepting the hospitality of Mr. Carl Dieter, when it was apparent to everybody for miles around... ...that the circumstances offered no alternative. I put it to you. That this divorce action was first motivated by jealousy... pure and simply by jealousy. You went back on your word on your promises... ...because you were jealous of your wife and Mr. Dieter. You misconstrued an act of kindness... as you have misconstrued every episode I have recalled you... ...because of your unreasonable, uncontrollable jealousy It's not true. What is not true? That you went back on your word? Or that you are jealous? It wasn't a question of going back on my word. That's got nothing to do with it. Being jealous of Dieter, I mean. But I... Well, he put my wife in a most compromising position. He put your wife in a most compromising position. I see. Now, I would like to take you back to the Iberian Grand Prix... ...and the night you seem to recall so vividly at the Hotel Playa. Do you also recall the events that followed? Yes, I do. She ran out on the beach. I was annoyed with her. She sang in a nightclub, made a public exhibition of herself. A public exhibition. I see. You found your wife alone. There was no one else with her. No, no one else. Were you not aware that the beach was a public one, - overlooked by the terraces of the hotel... - Well... And that other eyes were watching... ...while you forced your wife into an act of love? I never said... Did you or did you not make love to your wife... ...on a public beach overlooked by the hotel? Yes, I did. And of course your wife was willing. No. But since she was your wife, this didn't matter? Nor did it matter that you were compromising her... ...making a public exhibition of her. I object, my lord. Yes, Mr. Stanley? You allowed Mr. Loring to be recalled on the grounds of new evidence. All this is irrelevant, totally irrelevant. My lord, with all due respect to my learned friend, all this is not in the least irrelevant. It is necessary, substantiating evidence. Proceed. - As I was saying... - I know exactly what you were saying. And my answer is I had the right to. She was my wife. Which is to imply that she had no rights as such? After the accident... while you were still in hospital and before you were aware of your condition, did you or did you not say to your wife... "I will make it up to you."? Well, I... I'm not sure. You do not recall saying those words? I don't recall the exact phraseology, my lord. But you did say something similar. Yes, my lord. Soon afterwards you signed a document... ...agreeing to your wife's treatment by Dr. Cameron. But between signing the document and its fruition... you told neither your wife nor Dr. Cameron... ...that you had suddenly taken a violent dislike to the whole business. Do you recall the day of May 27th? - I'm not sure. - Then I will refresh your memory. It was on that day when your wife first told you that she was pregnant. Shortly afterwards you made love to her... and in so doing accepted the fact of her condition. You had condoned it! - Did you or did you not? - I cannot say that... Did you or did you not? Silence in court! Yes, I did. Thank you. That will be all, my lord. You may be seated, Mr. Loring. My lord, I would like to call Sir John Loring. After luncheon, Dr. Stanley, don't you think? It's almost one o'clock. Here you are, another slice of sering human drama for the afternoon edition. - Off you go. - Okay, sir. Oh, tell the sports editor not to forget my ticket for the big fight tonight. Well, Mark. I got a table at the Savoy. So you thoroughly disapproved of this marriage. It was a clandestine marriage and I didn't like that. Oh, come, Sir John. Clandestine? Why, that means something secret, underhand. This young couple married on the spur of the moment, there was nothing underhand about it. I objected to the off-handed fashion in which... It was your daughter-in-law that you objected to, wasn't it? - I hardly knew my son's wife. - I mean you objected to her on principle. She came from show business, the theater. A singer in fact. You weren't prepared to give her a chance. The unhappy memory of your own unsuccessful marriage to an actress. - I must protest! - My lord, this is absolutely monstrous! Yes. I think, Mr. Jacobus, I need hardly say. I apologize, my lord. You had a conversation with your daughter-in-law... ...in the hospital shortly after the tragic accident. I did. Was it then you made your first attempt to break up this marriage? First? Well, you admit you made an attempt at that occasion? Yes, I did. In fact you tried to buy Mrs. Loring off. Oh, put it that way if you want to. Why did you want to separate this young couple? Didn't your son need his wife more than ever after what had happened? I know my son. He would soon have tired of her. It was nothing more than a passing infatuation. So you thought to rid him of her quickly. Naturally I was concerned for my son. As it turned out, it was for both their sakes. She'd lost their child, he was now sterile and no further use to her. I thought she'd be pleased and practical enough... ...to agree to an arrangement. - But she didn't agree. - She had more ambitious ideas. She knew that a child was her only hope. - Of what? - Of having a pemanent hold on my son. - And of the Loring fortune. - Exactly. - You realized this? - I did indeed. And I took care of it by informing my son that he was sterile. I wished to protect him from a scheming woman. And also to protect the Loring estate. Same thing. So naturally you weren't very happy... ...when you learned of the outcome of this visit to Dr. Cameron's clinic. I was absolutely disgusted. For any particular reason? For every possible reason. You heard your daughter-in-law say in this court that she loved your son. - That she would always love him. - I did. I believe that was what she said to you in the hospital. After you offered her a comfortable way out of this marriage. It was. - Do you think she was telling the truth? - Do I think? Look where we are now. Do you suppose that my son would have been forced to take refuge here... ...if his wife had really loved him? I have nothing more to ask you. Silence! My lord, On behalf of Sir John Loring, may I beg the indulgence of the court in asking... Ah, there you are. Mark, do you hear me? I'm going back to the office. The judge was most reasonable about it. They can always send for me if they want to but they won't, of course. Well, I think I've just about done the trick for us. They've got that disgusting old quack Cameron on the box now. Stanley will deal with him. During these eighteen years as a specialist in artificial insemination, I assume that many couples have come to you. Many. People who would otherwise have led childless and unhappy lives. In these cases, who's name is on the birth certificate as the father? The husband. I always insist upon that. But that is a false statement. It's the same as an adoption. The couple assume responsibility for the child. But adoption is legal. But to force your patients deliberately to sign a fraudulent statement is criminal. A risk I'm prepared to take. Would you say that Mark Loring... at the time of signing the document agreeing to your treatment... ...was emotionally stable? It was obvious that he was under strain. But I fully believed... his wife did too, that having this child would alleviate that. And now then, Dr. Cameron. You were a party to this technical adultery? I won't accept that! It is not adultery! Oh, no, that's too easy, far too easy. At that rate any woman who commits adultery can say, "No, I didn't, it was by artificial insemination, ask Dr. Cameron." - It's a splendid alibi. - How dare you! My lord, this is an attempt on the part of my learned friend... to debase an honest man whose treatment is done openly and decently! - Decently? - In order to concieve a child! Mr. Stanley, the act of adultery is unrelated to its consequences. But, My lord, this is adultery. From a husband it is not regarded as intercourse. That has been established by law. Therefore, from a donor, it is not adultery! The law relating to marriage is designed for the preservation of family life. It holds that the surrender of the reproductive power... ...to another man is adultery! But in this case it is not another man. It is a test tube. Therefore, I maintain that men like Dr. Cameron... are striking at the very heart of our civilization. Conjuring up these phantom fathers to fill the world with test tube babies. I maintain it's time the law brought its ideas up to date. First of all, Mr. Stanley, are you cross-examining the witness or addressing the court? I do most humbly apologize, my lord. And your term will come too, Mr. Jacobus. I beg your pardon, my lord. As for you, Dr. Cameron, you will restrain yourself and only answer the questions put to you. As for your last remark, it was quite out of order and most disrespectful. May I explain. The court is doing exactly as you suggest. In this particular case, as always, we're all working very hard... ...to bring our ideas up to date. The court will adjourn until tomorrow morning at half past ten. Good afternoon, Mr. Mark. Give me a minute, my boy. I have something important here that won't wait. And I have something important... ...which won't wait either. Oh, what is it? Well, a bit of a tussle in there, hm? Still, I'm quite happy with the way things are going. And I'm deeply unhappy. Oh, come, come, Mark, just because you had a bit of a trouncing in the witness box? I mean, we had to expect something like this. You were in court. You must have seen what a fool I've been. I thought you came out very well. There's no reason for you to reproach yourself. There's every reason to. - I don't understand. - Of course you don't. We've never understood each other. You and I have spoken a different language all our lives. What the devil are you talking about? The lousy mess I've made of my life with Mary. It is no time for recriminations. The past is finished. We've disposed of Mary. You mean you've disposed of Mary. I'm not finding it quite that easy. It's a fine time to tell me this. After all the trouble and expense I've had to rid ourselves of this woman. You know, I'm just beginning to see what kind of a person you really are. - Mark! - I escaped from you when I married Mary. My accident was your chance to get me back. Of course I wasn't an entirely complete human being, but that didn't matter to you. The bits and pieces were enough. As long as you could have them all to yourself. - I wanted to protect you! - You wanted to possess me! Just as I wanted to possess Mary. She said to me once... "Nothing's ever enough for you, Mark, not even me." If only I'd understood her. If only I'd stayed with her and fought things out instead of limping back to you. Some people don't know what's best for them. - And there are those who play God. - How dare you! Don't shout at me! I'm looking out for you. Because you're my son. A father wants his son... his only son... ...to be perfect, something to be proud of. And am I something to be proud of? I don't think so. Mark... Mark. You had a trying day. Let's have dinner at the club and talk it over? There aren't going to be any more dinners at the club. They won't let me in. Well, there will be two speeches, for and against. - Him and her? - Sort of, yes. Then the judge will sum up. Should be some good stuff there between the three of them. You stick around, I may need you. - Look after that, please. - Yes, sir. I think Stanley will leap in and let her hardly speak at all. After all, he's got the great big sentimental world behind him, it should be easy for him. - Good morning, Mrs. Loring. - You'll let me know if I'm wanted? - Indeed. - Thank you. I promised your lawyer I wouldn't speak to you until the case was over, but I... Oh, it seems so silly. - It makes sense really. - Of course it does. People... the jury and all the others are easily misled. But with Dr. Cameron here it's most respectable. I'm not so sure anymore. Mary, there's something I want to tell you. This... this is a bad place to say these things. Everything seems to get twisted around, but... Mary, I'm not a rich man and I have very little to offer you... - Karl... - No, please, please listen to me. Whatever happens in court today, whatever happens, I want you to know that if there's anything I can do, or if you should need any help, I'll be there. Don't say anything now. Just remember what I said. I will be there. If it please the court. Yes, Mr. Jacobus? My lord. And members of the jury. Who has the right to condemn a woman... for being a woman... ...and for wanting to give her husband a child? The one thing that is truly hers to give. What wife should be deserted... ...because she went to every extreme to save a marriage? Can a husband call this mental cruelty? And can the world call Mary Loring's search for fulfillment.. ...a matter of adultery? Thou shalt not commit adultery. But what does the word adultery mean? A voluntary act by a married person with one to whom they are not married. There has been no evidence given in this courtroom... that either the respondent or her husband... ...has been guilty of such an act. Mr. Stanley has spoken of technical adultery. One word negates the other. If a woman is guilty of adultery, then she is guilty of having been with another man. Our co-respondent in this case is an unknown man. Unknown to both Mark and Mary Loring. I do not think that the moral aspect should be discussed in this courtroom. The morality of what they have done must lie with Mark and Mary Loring. In their hearts, and in their consciences, and with God above. Mark Loring agreed to his wife's treatment in this clinic of his own free will. By his own admission, he condoned the act shortly after it took place. And then, because he was filled with his own inner doubts, and governed by his uncontrollable jealousy, he left her to go through this pregnancy alone. He sued her for divorce. and in due course accused her of adultery, and seeked to label this child, this child that he had agreed to of his own free will, as illegitimate. Who then is guilty? Guilty... ...of mental cruelty? I have only the greatest compassion... ...for Mark Loring. But he is an adult... ...to whom all civil rights are availed. But what of this child, this unborn child, who as yet has no rights... civil or otherwise? Is it to be cruelly victimized by a man's jealousy? Harshly dealt with because of a man's false pride? The child's status as heir to the Loring estate... ...is a matter for this court. But the legitimacy of its birth cannot be questioned. I say, that whosoever should be its father, it is legally, undisputedly and clearly Mark Loring's child. Where then is there a question of adultery? That is the case for the respondent, my lord. My lord, and members of the jury, I do not use the authorities as reference... ...or substantiation in our case. Instead, I use the Bible. And so, members of the jury, you will understand... ...that this is a grave and serious matter. For what in fact you are going to decide in this case... is whether artificial insemination resulting in the conception of a child... ...is adultery. Or alternatively, whether in resorting to such a method of conception... ...the respondent has been guilty of treating her husband with cruelty. The other questions that arise from this... --- it is a question of adultery. You will now retire and consider your verdict. Would you like to come outside? The jury may be gone some time. No, thank you. Mr. Loring. It is perhaps difficult for you to speak to me, but... ...there is something I want to say to you. Something you must believe. Nothing happened between Mary and me that night. She was too much in love with you... ...for me to have a chance. And I think she still is. And if you were not an Englishman, you would know that yourself. Please excuse me. It shouldn't be long now. Are you sure you won't come out? No, thank you. Do you... do you mind if I talk to you? No. Are you all right? Oh, yes... yes, thanks. After all this you must hate me. Oh, Mark. I could never hate you. It all seems so indecent. Yes... yes, it was. The child will be taken care of. I've made all the arrangements. I've learned a lot about myself in this... in this courtroom. - No matter what the jury decides... - Let's wait for them. It doesn't seem any more to say. I shall always love you. Silence. Has the jury reached it's verdict? No. I'm sorry, my lord. We find ourselves unable to agree. We will never be able to agree, my lord. It's most unfortunate. A retrial is the only alternative. I won't! I want to stop this case. I was completely wrong. I should never have brought it. Mr. Stanley, I trust there's some explanation... ...for the petitioner's extraordinary behavior. My lord, I know I would not appeal to you in vain... to forgive the impetuosity of a young man... ...who has suddenly realized that he had made an almost irreparable mistake. - Well, Mr. Stanley? - My lord... members of the jury. My client, the petitioner in this divorce action, begs the indulgence of the court... and apologizes most sincerely for the trouble that he has caused. But at this time... he wishes to withdraw the charges against the respondent... and ask your lordship to dismiss the petition. I find this an eminently satisfactory ending. Mary.
