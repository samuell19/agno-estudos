Parents, this way please. Ready! Meal boxes are here. I'll go get the money. The meal boxes are outside. How much are they each? $65... Special price for the hearing impaired. I need to go to work. Ride carefully. Thank you. Why is she in a hurry? She hasn't eaten her meal. She's not on the swimming team. She's my sister, Yang Yang. Yang Yang. Are you okay? I'll take you to the hospital. You can come get your scooter later. Thanks. Sorry, I can't stay. I need to deliver other meal boxes. Your MSN. Can I have it? I'll give you 15% off next time. Sorry, sorry. Tian Kuo, what's the matter with you? Why so long? You delivered to the USA? Great. Look at those. Now you get to eat all the canceled orders. Don't you dare leave any unfinished. Where's the basket? Ah. Did you lose it again? The basket was new! Brand new! Help. Another customer wants seven lunch boxes. Dad, I've got seven. You! Stay quiet and eat your food. Those cold meal boxes can't sell. See? I am eating cold meal boxes myself. Look at yourself! I wonder who will marry you. Hurry up. I know. I am stir-frying veggies. Why don't you ask Tian Kuo to help. It's already one o'clock, he needs to eat. The kid's still growing. I don't know people at 20 still grow. They are kids as long as they are not married. Cook! Boys. Is there a special meaning to her name? Does her voice sound like singer Jolin or Chiling? Like your mom. Mom! What are you doing! Don't peek at my screen. Peek at what? Finish your food and stop talking to yourself. Focus. Make sure you don't leave any scraps. Or you'll marry an ugly, pimpled-face wife. Mom, look! I finished everything. You really finished everything. Now you need to exercise and burn the calories. Or you'll be like your father with a donut waist. I remember when I first married your father, I was still skinny and sexy. After I started eating his meal boxes, I became what I am now - donut waist. This is what you get with calories. What are you doing? What are you up to? I'm too old for that. Here, here. You're going to marry an ugly wife. Finish your food. Thank you. Come over. Thank you. Sorry. We're sold out today. Sorry. They're all gone today. We'll have more tomorrow. Thank you! We're sold out. Sorry. Isn't there still one left? It's already ordered. Sorry. Hey. It's you again. I forgot to thank you yesterday. Also forgot to ask your name. My name is Tian Kuo. Tian Kuo. Hi. I was online using MSN last night. But I didn't see you. I worked last night, so I didn't go online. I saw people lining up for your meal box. Your meal box must be really famous. Of course. My dad learned with a famous chef from Hong Kong. No one can beat him in cooking. Smile again. Smile again. Please. It's delicious. Thanks. How's your injury? Does it still hurt? It's my treat. That won't do. I'll pay you when I get paid. I've got a way. What is it? Come watch a movie with me. In exchange for the meal box. I'll pay for the ticket. How long is the movie? About two hours. I can't. It's too long. I don't have enough time. I need to go to work. Watch out. She can't hear me anyway. Off line again? What's the use for MSN? You must be busy. Never go online. I don't even see you at the stadium anymore. Now I sell one less meal box. Is she angry... because of the meal box money? (Chicken leg Meal Box ~ Sender: Meal Box Kuo) When I first met you, you were like a water bird. Flying far and high, by stepping on the water. Why water birds can soak in water for some time without catching a cold? Because water birds' feathers produce oil. So they won't catch a cold. She must find my water bird theory boring. (Melancholic Rice Bowl ~ Sender: Meal Box Kuo) Yang Yang, what kind of job do you do? Why don't you find a stable job? Doing menial jobs is very tiring. The pay is not stable, and what if you meet a bad person. It's dangerous. You got to be careful. She must think I'm too nagging. Must be my mom. Always nagging at me. I must have inherited it from her. Inherit what from who? It hurts. So you still know how to feel pain? (Your water bird theory is interesting,) What, you think I'm going to beat you? To be frank, I'm really tired. Freeze. Still so cute. (but I don't like to stay in the water.) (I'm going with my sister to the gym.) (You coming?) Isn't this better than watching a movie? When you swim, watch your arms. You didn't lift your back, and your body. I don't understand. You don't understand? Watch your arms, and keep your back straight. Let me. When you swim, you need to arch your body. Xiao Peng knows how to read lips? No. She knows how to read facial expressions. Since she was young, she knew how to read people, and knew what the adults wanted before they asked. So the adults always took a liking to her. It's really because she can't hear. That's why she's so sensitive. How come you're the only one working? Yet Xiao Peng can focus on swimming? Xiao Peng used to work. However, she quit her job to fit his schedule. Where are your parents? My dad is a missionary. After my mom passed away, I promised dad that I would take good care of her. So dad could focus on his work in Africa. It feels like you're the elder sister. She feels like the younger one. You don't have siblings, do you? I am the only son. Your parents must dote on you. Dote? I suppose so. Wow. This is pork bone soup with lotus seeds. Whitens your skin. Promotes metabolism. That's not a good one. Promotes metabolism. Lowers blood pressure. It even burns away fat. No way. She's already too skinny. Who's too skinny? Mom! Why do you talk so loud but walk so silently? Really? You also stewed a pot of soup? That's a big meal box. Who is it for? It's a meal box for charity. Meal box for charity. Who are you cherishing? Huang Tian Kuo. Where are you going? There is a lot of portions in that meal box. Do you know what price it should be? Nothing lower than $90! Did you hear me? Charity is priceless. What do you mean "priceless"? Young man, it's more important to know market prices. (I am standing right in front of your door.) Hey sorry Did you wait for a long time? Not really. Whew. The soup is still warm. The economy must be really bad. You guys spent so much time on the soup... just to attract people to buy the meal box. Actually... It's delicious. Uh... It's better today... The meal box must be expensive? It's free. It's a left over. That won't do. I must pay. I must. It's fine. It's fine. I'll count the meal box as $80. Is that too cheap? You don't have much partition in your home. Feels spacious. The hearing impaired need visual aid. If they can't see everything they become uneasy. So dad insisted that we live in an open space. That way we can see everything in the house. Is $85 enough? There are so many medals. They all belong to Xiao Peng. There. And there. This was Xiao Peng's first champion medal. That's awesome. Xiao Peng is really good at swimming, and she excels in academics. She's not like me. All I do is play. I thought you are all work, no play. Since your father is away, you have to earn all the living expenses. Must be tiring. It's not. I just need to hold on during the training. After we win, we can pay the loans off. Then life will be easier for us. Or is it $90? I need to go to work now. - You're not going to eat? - Take a seat. Go ahead and take it. Say thank you. Bye Bye. You can't move unless I give you money, right? So you can't just leave in a hurry, right? I've always wanted to tell you something. But we never spent enough time together. Sometimes you would be gone before I can tell you. I've never met someone like you. All you ever speak of is Xiao Peng. You never mentioned anything about yourself. Because you never think about yourself. This has caused me to think of you more. I still miss you after I went home, and I still wanted to talk to you. Sign language is not tiring to me at all. Kiddo. She'll only move if you throw in money. Thanks. You hungry? Let's go grab something to eat. I've got money now. I'll treat. I need to remove my make-up first. Wait for me. Okay. Fire! Take the car away! There's a fire upstairs. Is anyone still inside? Fire! Big bowl or small bowl? Super bowl. You find a seat I'll go order. Delicious. Fishball soup. I'm so satisfied. I haven't been so fulfilled in a long time. I wanted to ask you. If no one gave you money during your performance... You would just stand there? Of course not. Dummy. What then? Go home. This is the way the "street performance" is. It's not possible to make money everyday. Are you full? My stomach feels warm. It's such a sensation. Check? Two bowls of noodles, please. Be right with you. Two bowls over here. Two large bowls of wonton noodles. Five side dishes. That's $275. Two, please. Hold on just a sec. This table is almost ready. This table is almost ready. I'll take this for you. Thank you. Here's is three hundred. Just a sec. No problem. Too tired to walk. Too full? Did I say something wrong? Will you tell me what's wrong? Do you look down... on the money I earned? Why would you think that? I already said it's my treat. Why did you pay? Because there were people waiting behind us. I didn't want to delay other people's time. So what if we let them wait. Do you know how long it took me to earn them? Can't they wait just a little bit. And you? Why can't you wait for me? It's not that. I just... Just what? You think it embarrassing that I pay in coins? No, I didn't... One dollar coins are still money. Do I need to be pushed around for counting coins? I just paid in advance. You can pay me back. It's fine. I'll pay back when I've changed the coins to cash. In case you think coins are too bothersome. That's not... Yang Yang Are you ok? I'm fine. Sorry. If only I were at home. It's not your fault. I fell asleep and didn't notice the fire broke out. I should have come home earlier. You're so busy How could you have known about the accident? Look at you. You haven't even washed off your make-up? Go home and rest. I just choked on the smoke. Don't think too much of it. What if the fire was more severe? What if you weren't only choked by the smoke? What if the fire department had not come in time? Then I would have lost you. My most precious Yang Yang. I had mixed feeling when I knew what happened. I am worried that you girls would be scared, but I know that God, in His power, will show His grace and keep you safe. Just as He has blessed my work in Africa. Yang Yang. God has special arrangements for Xiao Peng. And for you as well. Don't let yourself be engulfed by guilt and doubt, and don't let your friends feel pressured. I pray for my beloved daughters daily. (Immanuel.) (Your loving father.) The coach said Xiao Peng has throat and rib damage. Would it affect her eligibility to the Deaflympics? The coach is still evaluating. Maybe he'll just rear range the relay team order. Xiao Peng has really high expectations for herself. If she knew she might affect everyone's score in a negative way, it would upset her. Don't let her know. We'll just work harder. That way we'll make up for the score. (Where are you?) What are you doing here? What are you thinking? What if you can't compete because of me? Is that what you're worried about? You're not worried. You don't need to worry. I'll catch up to everyone when I've recovered. The coach told me yesterday, that I have improved my performance by 0.1 second. Therefore I can rest 1/10 of the time. It'll be fine. What is this? Is it for me? In order for you to hear me, my words are soft like a seagull's footprint. Wonton noodles. Thank you. Where's the cute mute girl from last time? What's the use of cuteness when you're mute? Would you have let me marry a deaf girl? What a pity. She was cute, but she was mute. She is not a mute. She's hearing - impaired. We can hear. She can't. She has a name, and her name is Yang Yang. Her sign language name is: Yang Yang. Are you okay? Eat something. I don't want to. What's wrong? You don't make those charity boxes anymore. Rejected? Rejection. I don't even know if our love ever started. Has it really started? I don't know. I know. Before I met your mother, I've been rejected 23 times. 23 times? Quiet down or your mom will hear me. Turn on the faucet. Come. Dad, I'm surprised you have such a rich history. It was just tough luck, not being able to meet your mother first. She's a good woman. Even though she's loud and nagging, but she still takes care of the household and us. Just now, she yelled at you outside, then she came in and tells me to console you. That's how she is. She seems tough but she's soft hearted. What do you mean? She's got a knife for a mouth and tofu for a heart. Oh. Honestly, what kind of girls do you like? When you're in a stable relationship, don't forget to bring her home so we can meet her. Dad, would you let me date... a girl who can't hear? Dear... What's up? Did he say anything? Is he still sad? What kind of a girl, can sweep our Tian Kuo off his feet? I would like to see if she is fat or skinny. She can't hear. Can't hear? You mean "can't hear" as in her ears don't work? Duh. What else could it be? Her nose? Move the chairs. Dear, you okay? I'm fine. Tian Kuo said that although she can't hear, she is a hardworking, optimistic, cute, lively, filial, amicable, and kind girl. Oh. She is nice to her sister, Uh. Tian Kuo said so. There's nothing wrong with not being able to hear. So long as you don't say anything no one will know. What if you need to say something? Then write it down. Don't forget that Tian Kuo know sign language. Tian Kuo does, but we don't. No. That's true. (March to Deaflympics - Xiao Peng #1) Tian Kuo. Huang Tian Kuo. Come down and go deliver lunch boxes. How many take outs? Three. Three take - outs. Where is he? Doesn't he know we're busy? What. Your sign language sucks. Luckily I understand. Go. Go. Go. I don't need you to tell me. I'm his mom. What's the hurry. Tian Kuo. Tian Kuo. Will you come help mommy? Mom. Dad. Tian Kuo. Take this to the Hong Tai Company. The receipt is on top. - Okay. - Ride carefully. Thank you. Tian Kuo, your safety helmet. - You must wear the helmet. - Thanks, mom. Here. This is $3000. Keep it. Don't hurry back. Go have fun with your friends. Buy or eat something with this money. Oh, yeah, and... Cheer up. Ah? Yes, yes, yes... Cheer up is the way to go. Are you still mad at me? Sorry, I didn't mean to fight with you last time. Will you forgive me, please? Will you stop being angry? I'm love-sick. Don't hit me. Girls shouldn't be so narrow minded. I already said I didn't look down on small money. Will you stop being unreasonable? Who would be angry for cash or coins? Don't think you're the only one with dignity. I have temper too. It's finished. She'll never talked to me again. Isn't an apology enough? What's up? Are you okay? I'm fine. We're going to eat later. You want to come? Sure. Just go back. You? I'll wait for them. I can wait with you. There's no need. We're going to eat later. I can go with you guys. I don't want you to come. (The end is near. Start planting trees.) (One tree.) (Two trees.) (Three trees make a beautiful forest.) (One acre of rain forest vanish each second) (which is the size of two football fields) (137 species of animals become extinct daily) (lf the situation continues,) (The water birds may soon be extinct.) (So to prevent that from happening to you,) (take me and plant me in your home.) Have you ever thought that we might not get along? Not everyone can love water birds and trees. Maybe someone wants me to disappear. And you... become extinct. You drank alcohol? What were you thinking? You've just recovered, you can't drink. What if it affects your training? Have you forgotten your dream? You only care about my dreams. What about yours? What? What is your dream? Doesn't living for another person bother you? What are you talking about? Your dream is my dream. Why must you steal my dream? Steal? You are you, and I am I. Why do you project my dream on yourself? No one can live for another person. I may not be able to hear, but I still need my own life. I won't get gold medals my entire life. You shouldn't sacrifice your life for me. Can you tell me what happened? The coach told me, my performance has regressed. It's probably going to affect my eligibility. You can't compete anymore? No I can't. I've lost the chance to compete this year, the chance to show the world how hard I've worked, and the chance for you to wave that flag for me. All of the hard work is wasted. Sorry. Sorry. It's all my fault. Sorry. Don't you understand? All this has nothing to do with you. I'm not sorry that I cannot get a medal, it's because I can't get the medal for you! For me? You work so hard. You never go out dating. You skip meals. You've sacrificed everything for me, but I can't win a gold medal for you. How can I face you? How will we pay the loan without the prize money? Don't worry about the loan... I'm your elder, but I let you take care of me. Who's taking care of whom, does it matter? I don't want to be your burden. You are not my burden. You are my sister. I only need to stand still when I perform. But when you swim, you're competing in milli-seconds. To have you as an elder sister, makes me so proud. When we were kids, you ignored those who bullied you. You never got angry. Yet when someone bullied me, you would go and beat them up. Having you as my elder sister, I feel so proud. You've never been a burden to me. If there is a next life, will you still be my sister? (Happy Meal Box Boy: How are you?) (Me too. You need to rest.) (March to Deaflympics - Xiao Peng #1:) (You have the wrong person.) (You must have mistaken me for another girl) (I am Yang Yang.) (I know you are Yang Yang.) (Since you never reply to my messages,) (and I can' t stop thinking of you,) (I fantasized that you wrote me many messages) (Then I replied to them.) (I can go to sleep now.) (Are we that familiar?) (Do you think that we won't get along) (because of hearing problems?) (Do you have a dream?) (Yes.) (Marry a girl,) (have two kids.) (One boy, one girl.) (Is it an impossible dream,) (for a hearing person to date someone) (who is hearing impaired?) (It's easier than your sister winning a medal) Why is she ignoring me again? Did I say something wrong again? Yang Yang... I love you. I love you. She's gone again. It's so beautiful here. Do you remember catching crabs when we were kids? I do. We always returned home all dirty and smelly. Mom used to yell at us so angrily. I laughed and said that you ran like a water bird. A boy once told me, that I looked like a water bird. He's seen you run as well? Is that boy Tian Kuo? Yes. He looks like a good guy. You two are a good match. I'm not going to date him. Why? He can't hear either. Do you like him? I've often thought of him. How come you can't just say you like him? Is it because of me? Egrettas fly according to seasons. I hope you can be like an water bird, and not be confined to one place. If you leave me one day, and fly freely like a water bird, I would be very happy. You don't want me to stay by your side? No, I don't mean that. I want you to believe that I can be independent. I didn't say I don't believe you. If you believe that I could be independent, why would you reject a deaf person? It's because you spend all your time on me. You think you can't take care of him. You don't think the deaf can take care of others. Dad always encouraged us, and told us to never give up. I did not give up swimming. You should not give up on him. What's up? - For me? - Yeah. When did it arrive? I don't know. I thought it belonged to a customer, but it said Tian Kuo. You are Huang Tian Kuo, so it must be yours. There's money too. Lots of it. Why did you come back? She probably hasn't gone too far. So what if I get her back. Ah? Even if I get her back, would you guys accept her? That's the girl who can't hear? The hard - working, optimistic, cute, lively, energetic, filial, kind, nice to her sister, and nice to everyone? Yes. Dear, we should find time to learn sign language. Huh? Ah what? You know. Mommy just loves to talk. Sometimes my chin gets sore because I talks too much. It's good to let it rest every once in a while. That would be better, right? Yes, then my ears can rest too. You think I'm noisy? You're the one that said it, not me. So you guys are okay? Thank you mom, thank you dad. I love you guys. I love you guys to death. Yang Yang... I want to invite you home for dinner. Why? I want to introduce you to my parents. Why? Because I like you. I want to be your boyfriend. But I can't hear. They won't accept me. They will see. Besides, you told me before, if the deaf cannot see, I guarantee you, I will let you, and them see my love for you. Can I invite you home for dinner? Why? I want to introduce you to my parents. Why? I want to give you a job at our restaurant. But I can't hear. Will your parents agree? They... will see will see my... They will see your effort and dedication. Dad Mom! Dad Mom! Dear, they are here. So pretty. This is the girl I was talking about. Yang Yang. Hurry. Let her sit. They asked you to have a seat. Tian Kuo's Mom, l... Move on. (We welcome you.) (Thank you for liking Tian Kuo.) (Tian Kuo is just like you.) (Hard-working.) (Optimistic.) Hurry up. (Cute.) Next one. (Lively.) Hurry up. (Filial.) Very amicable. Very kind. (Nice to his sister.) Does Tian Kuo have a sister? I don't think so. Why did you put down sister? He made a mistake. Nice to his parents... Next one. Nice to everybody. Hurry. (So, will you marry him?) She never said she's going to marry me. How would you know if you don't ask? She's not even my girlfriend. Then what kind of a friend is she? I do. I do. You can talk? She can talk. I thought you can't hear. I can hear. Why didn't you say anything? You never asked. That's because... because... I thought you couldn't hear. I didn't think you could hear either. How is that possible? I sell meal boxes. What does that have to do with the ability to hear? True. How are they related? Are they related? I don't think so. I must have said something in front of you. Yeah. Yesterday. Technically, you've said something behind me. You heard all that? Then why did you lie to me? You didn't tell me the truth either. I asked you why you're inviting me to your house. You said you were going to find me a job. So... You didn't come here to see my parents because I can hear, right? Of course not. It's because... I like you. Did you hear that. She said she likes him. I heard it. She likes him. Wait. Then how did you guys talk when you dated? We didn't talk. We used sign language. Sign language? I've actually imagined your voice. Oh. Yeah. Who does it sound like? Just like you. How did you become so skilled in sign language? When I was in college, I met a sign language teacher. He asked me if I was interested. So I studied under him. You must have been a diligent student. Honestly, after I met you, I spent a lot of work on my sign language. When I was young, I did not like sign language, because I always have to translate for Xiao Peng, so I never have enough time for myself. Until one day, Xiao Peng asked me if the piano sounds nice. Then I started crying. From that day on, I studied sign language diligently. I want her to understand all of the sounds. I got it. I got it. It's like when I wanted you to hear the rain. Why? I think it sounds like longing. When did the water bird I gave you have siblings? Whenever I think of you, I'll throw in a dollar. Slowly, each one filled to capacity. So I had to buy a new one. I know you love me, but can you let me go first? Did you see Xiao Peng? Xiao Peng? Where? Thanks. Go. Go. Go. Why didn't you go to practice? I quit the competition. What do you mean? I can't regain my speed in time. I've decided to look for a job first, and practice while I work. When I'm ready, I'll enter the next competition. Don't worry about the money. I'll handle it. Just focus on your training. I told you. I cannot get gold medals my entire life. Even if I do, I still have to work to support myself. Whether I am a coach or a janitor, as long as I am ready, I can still enter the competition. Awesome! So touching... I support you! Look at me. Lin Xiao Peng. In my heart, you are already number one! Number one. Number one forever. Thank you. Number one. (Four years later.) (Love and dreams are miraculous.) (They don't need to be heard, to be said,) (or translated.)
