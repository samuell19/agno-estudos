The player isn't worth shit. They get you later with the CD's at twenty bucks a pop. A microwave then. My old lady's always dreamed of one! Nah, dude, they make everything taste like rubber. Don't take that crap! Whaddya mean crap, dude? The mixer is essential! Essential for what? For making shakes, dude, whaddya think. Ya, dude, you are so right! Shakes! Let's split!

SECOND ATTEMPT INTERNET. CONNECTING... These movies with humans are always the same! You don't understand a thing! This is B-movie! Hey, guys! Beat it, Mercano, we're watching a movie! I'm on planet Earth! And what do you want us to do? Come and get me! What are you doing there? C'mon, please... No way, dude, it's too far! But how did you get there? I was just relaxing at home and... Hello. We are from planet Earth. We mean you no harm. Cut it out! Let me finish! But what are you doing over there on the Earth? And? C'mon! After a long voyage, I entered the Earth's atmosphere. Something went wrong with my ship and it couldn't brake. And I've been here so long I can't take it anymore... Come and get me! No way, man, you'll have to bail yourself out! It's your own fault for being such a hothead! Ahhh! Was that Mercano? Whatever, let's finish watching the movie. Aw, poor little guy. And if we go and get him? And...? Yeah, truth is we could, couldn't we? Totally! Though, truth is, it doesn't seem like a good idea. That's what I said. It's really far. No! I said it first! But he's such a sweet guy! We should go and get him! Shouldn't we? T's true. Mercano is the best! He's helped me out tons of times! But the problem with Mercano is he's always getting into trouble. Wouldn't it be better not to go? What the hell died in this bag, amigo?! The stink is killing me! Hey, look what's in here! This is the jackpot! They tossed out everything ready to eat! Check it out, Charly! This is a banquet, dude! With cheese! - With bugs! - Bud, we'll be pigging out all week, man! Hey, stop it, dude! Don't hit me! Boys, Girls? Boys, Girls? Yo, Mr. Taxi Driver! Go see a shrink! I am a shrink! Stop it, dude! Aaaahhh! Uaaaau! This is the ultimate! A Martian! Let's see, kid. Show us whatchya got! All you got, kid? You know where we're gonna stuff that clown suit?! Stop it! Tomorrow he'll bring more stuff! Right, Slim? If he knows what's good for him, tomorrow he'll bring more stuff... right? Because it's to buy some medication for my old lady. Fatty, man, you're kind of soft, yeah, very soft. I hate school! Mom, I'm home! Milk! Oh, by the way, I flunked phys ed. But luckily I'm doing good in math. Well, I guess I'll look at stuff through my telescope. Let me see if there are any planets or stars. Oh! It's daytime! Well, I'll play with my spaceships. Oh! This is boring! I'd rather surf the net! Let's see. MARS. SEARCH. Let's see if I can find something interesting. Oh! Always the same old, same old! I'm tired of this! Let's see here... And what's this? What's going on? Why's it doing that? Scary! Julian, your snack. Hello! Woah! A Martian! Are you really a Martian or is that a virtual body you created? Both. This is my virtual body and this is how I am. I am from Mars. You guys exist! I knew it! And are you there now? I've always dreamed of going to Mars! No, I'm here on the Earth. I want to go back but I can't because my spaceship is broken. And What's your name? Mercano. And yours? Julian! And this Whole virtual word, you made it yourself? What for? Yeah. It's just that I miss my planet. I'm not having a good time here. Yeah, me too. I don't have fun on Earth either. Julian! Oh! I have to eat... What do you eat? Triglocites. ...so then she gets close to me and says: Dolores, is that you? I just couldn't believe it! The two of us bandaged up like... mummies in the same clinic. I went just to get a few little things done: My cheekbones, nose, chin... What a coincidence! I'm done! It's terrible how Julian is behaving, you know. He was so studious! Now her just spends all day playing on that computer. You have to talk with him. Are you listening to me? Yes, yes, it's just I have to spend tonight preparing... a proposal for tomorrow. One billion there, no, we have to pay the debt... And the minister said, you know, Whatever... Buenos Aires? What's happened in Buenos Aires? I don't care. Buenos Aires is bullshit. It doesn't exist. Rio de Janeiro. New York, after the two towers... The columns rising... I should see... 345.588.120 millions... The balance does not close... Good morning, gentlemen! Good morning! We are in one of the most serious periods of recession that... our corporation has ever faced. We must seek new markets. I believe we should start by redefining our objectives. Economic objectives! Can there be any doubt? Quite correct, Mr. Economics. If we are in agreement then, let's begin with the proposals. Mr. Genetics. Health is a basic necessity. In our laboratories we are... developing a new type of flu bug for next winter. Sure, people get sick and take medicines, but then they stop buying other products, and, mind you, labs only represent 2% of our business. I think we need to reduce costs by implementing... a labor policy of "automization". We can't continue with employees when we can replace them... with machines which are much more efficient. I disagree. This would aggravate the unemployment situation... and get us into trouble with the government. What government? I insist that the only thing that can save us is consumer incentives. Note: Here I have a strategy that never fails. What do you think of launching this new lolita? Just twelve years old to re-motivate our consumers! Twelve years! Incredible! That's my son's age! Excuse me, Mr. Marketing, but the main consumption product is food. Our chains are developing more profitable foods. I propose, if you agree, to increase the percentage... of worms per hamburger, or if not... Mr. Food, I beg you not to discuss our food products at this time. It's killing my appetite. Sorry. Gentlemen, it's getting late and we haven't come up with anything new. Let's think different proposals for tomorrow. Virtual Mars is really cool! And you can do anything you want with the computer? Sure. What do you want me to do? Let's see, make me... Space and all the stars! Wow! The virtual universe is fantastic! Hey there, son! What you up to? Oh... Hi, pop... Are you playing a little game? This is even better, it's a virtual world! And what's it for? It's for everything. You can walk, you can run, chat. Look, this is the inventor. His name is Mercano. He's a Martian who can't return to Mars. This business is out of this world, gentlemen! Let's go in and see what it's all about. Pity that none of us thought of this. Don't worry. It's an independent project... that hasn't even been exploited yet. Surely it need some investors. It's marvelous! Okay then, let's find Who owns this! 86... 87... 88... 89... You won't catch me! 92... 93... 94... 95... 96... 97... 98... 99... 100! Juli?n! Mercano! Juli?n! Juli?n! Leave the computer and do your homework. Coming, mom, coming. What an idiot! Why did I speak? Julian! Just wait and see when your father gets home and finds out... that you skipped school so as to play on the PC! This must be the place. And What's the owner's name? Unh... Mercado... - Mercado, man? - Yes, Mercado. Turn it off now or you're going a week without the computer! Good day. Mister Mercado? I am Mr. Marketing, delighted. Truly a pleasure! It's incredible. Truly marvelous. We wanted to come personally... to congratulate you on your virtual world. I am Mr. Economy Enchant?! Tell us What's your business plan? To have fun. I told you. The entertainment industry! Bull. You didn't say anything! Gentlemen, calm down! We must think coldly. Excuse me, Mr. Mercado. Are you looking for investors? Investors? Ahem... investors... that is... Ten million dollars? Ten million? That is, I mean, 100 million! 100 million? - He's a pro! - He's playing with us as if we were little children! This guy is a shark! Unh... excuse me for intruding Mr. Mercado, but... Have you ever thought would you might be able... to do with 100 million? I'm not interested. Julian! Today is your lucky day, Mr. Mercado! I believe that you will be interested to know... that we have a new offer. Show Mr. Mercado the new project. I already told you I'm not interested! We have the technology and resources to construct a ship... capable of escaping the Earth's atmosphere, crossing enormous distance in space, and in a matter of hours arriving at the fourth planet: Mars. Do we have an agreement, Mr. Mercado? A pleasure to personally meet you, Mr. Mercado. Great businessmen always know how to arrive at an agreement. Let's celebrate as we do on our planet! You know... Come on, Market. Let's have a little champagne! Here's to the first ever intergalactic alliance! Let's sign the agreements. Globalization is expanding to the universe! The "crionization" of the Martian is a success, gentlemen! Congratulations to, Mr. Genetics! Now let's commence with the cerebral mapping... to obtain the information we need. The programmers are standing by to process the information. When will we be receiving the first scans? We don't know exactly how he will react. We must be careful. This little brain will be the biggest source... of ideas our company has ever had. And the information that we need to adapt our virtual world! Our Martian palace! These Martians really know how to do business! We plan to exploit various areas that have as of yet not been... taken advantage of and to create some new "rides". And the entrance? I imagine it won't be free. Of course not. The users will be able to pick, within their economic means, the virtual body they desire. Woah! I am totally pumped! With this body I'll be picking up all the chicks! Look! There's one now... Hey... Hi... Check out those two! What geeks! The virtual world is kickin'! No way... Check out the bodies we have! Sure, cuz we didn't pay... Check it out! I am cut like Gardel! I'm not paying nobody. And if we pull off another credit card scam? Forget those nerd games! What I found is bitchin', dude! It's a text that explains how technology... is going to destroy the human race. Serious? Then let's bust up everything! No. Stop. We have to study the deal to know what's the best course of action. Study what! Trash everything! Hey, Poxi, let's do a little slam dancing! Where could Mercano be? Now everything sucks. I don't like it. It used to be great. Mercano! You can't even imagine what we could do with this! They're waiting for us in the meeting. In the Martian's cerebral map we have discovered areas that... we had never explored, containing the concepts behind... the Martian principles for tele-transportation. It's a device that allows us to send products through the web. What does this mean for our business? Now that we have a captive audience, we have to exploit the time... that people spend in front of their computers. Let's call it "The Vaporizer!" The future arrives at your home... through the sensational Vaporizer! At first I couldn't believe it was possible, but since we got the Vaporizer at home... I'm spending more time with the wife and kids! Jacket! Everything you've always dreamed can be sent to your house... with just the touch of a button... Dress! ...or just by saying so! Helmet! Happiness is at the tip of your tongue! Say it and it's yours! Ask for the sensational Vaporizer... in the next five minutess and get a 2% discount! We're waiting! Don't delay! Just click us now! THE VAPORIZER: THE INVENTION OF THE MILLENIUM. CLICK NOW! I'm pissed off, dude! This crap will get everyone sucking their thumbs... in front of those damned machines! I can't take it anymore! Let's go to Barcelona! - Beer! - What's that? This thing's the best! I told you not to buy anything else from the Corporation! Cut it out! They're cold! Let's see. Wow! Hey! Slamdance! Stop, stop! What are we doing? Can't you see we're falling into their technological trap? Hey! Come here, nerd, come on! Lights! "FOR E-TET, WITH LOVE, MERCANO." I can't believe she's always beating us! Always the same! I'm tired of this! When she gets here we'll show her who's in charge! Do you know what I was just thinking about? - Looking for Mercano! - Let's go! Although, thinking it over... OK, may be better if we don't go. We are continuing to extract data from his subconscious, principally how they live on Mars. We have discovered that technology... there is equally available to everyone. So we have decided that our company will make... the technology accessible to everyone. We should give away computers to everyone! That's it! We shall sell PC to the entire world! We will have a global, captive clientele! I'll take charge of the design. A computer, simple to use, like a kitchen appliance. Even a housewife will be able to use it. Son, you know how to repair stuff. Fix my mixer! Hotdogs! Hotdogs! We got hotdogs! Hotdogs for a dollar! And you get a free computer! COMPUTING Ma'am, ma'am! Rub here! Hey, you won a computer! Hey, dude. Pass one of here, dude! Our global strategy is a success! We have managed to control 98% of the world market! One more little slice and we eat the whole pie! There is one of our computers in every household in the world. We have managed to make a great business, and everyone... will get to live the lifestyle they've always dreamed of! Cut it out, Rino! We have to get serious now! Hey, dude! Why can't we use the computer now? I toldya! It's technology, dude, and technology is starting to take away our freedom! Check out what it says here: The industrial revolution and its consequences... have been a disaster for the human race. It has increased our lifespans... while making our lives meaningless, taking away human dignity, increasing psychological suffering and inflicting, as well, great damage to the natural world." Poxi! Are you listening to me? Give it a rest. She drank a lot of beer, dude. Where could Mercano be? Julian! Dinner's ready. We'll be dining alone. Your father is getting home late. I'm not hungry, mom. What is with you, my son, you've been this way for some time now. It's just that I had this friend and now he has disappeared. Well, don't you worry. You'll find another friend. I'll tell Isabel to bring up a little sandwich. Ok? - What's that! - It's a sandwich! Not that! One's missing! Oh! You father took it the other day to the office with him! Oh, then... the virtual world... my missing spaceship... Oh, poppa! Yikes. Poor Mercano, they must have fooled him! Ready, commando! Tele-transport me! Now everyone will know! Dude, I can't keep drinking this warm beer! Let's buy a fridge. Forget it. We don't have any dough. But we can get it from the Vaporizer! I got another credit card number through a scam on the web! No way, dude, they'll catch us! And on top of that, fridges are technology! Enough with the technology! That's the problem. The puters are technology too! Sure, but we need them... And cold beers, too! What are you saying, if it's been ten years... since we've earned anything! Hey, careful! Act like you don't know nothing cuz here comes... the big boss' kid acting like a little space captain! I have to rescue Mercano! He's my friend! Hey, boys, check this out! Unh, tell Cacho! He doesn't know him! Cacho! Cacho! The boss'kid is here. Don't kill him, he's just playing around! I've come to free the Martian. Tell me where he is or I'll disintegrate you with my raygun! Take the stairs down to the sub-basement and go left! We're almost done! We've squeezed about everything we could out of this Martian! The helmet. The shoes. The clothing. Julian. Julian. Mercano! Mercano! Julian. Take this! Mercano, what's happened to you!? Say something! That's the last time I have a "little champagne". It's the guards! Come on, Mercano! I've got my gun, too! It's them! EXIT Well, well, little space captain! You were going to disintegrate us with your raygun? Here they are! In the Vaporizer HQ! Come quick! Mercano, bad guys there! Give up! You're surrounded! - Stop the Vaporizer! - Roger that! ITEM SELECTED: REFRIGERATOR STATUS: VAPORIZING Refrigerator, little fridge, come to me! Split! They've found us! Stop it! Stop! This is the sign we've been waiting for! This is what we must do with the technology! So, when I saw that a ship was missing, I said, "Poor Mercano, they've got him prisoner. I have to free him!", so that's what I did... That's it, dude! We have to destroy the Corporation's servers! We can get in here. One for you, one for me. I see you. I raise. I see you. - A hand you can't beat! - I'm out! We're against the machines, not the people! Up there! Those are the servers! Let's destroy them! I don't think we can get in 'cause that door is locked. Can it be opened from here? ACCESS DENIED Shit! This system is in cogol. In matter of minutes I can hack it! Tito! Tito! Tito! Are you there, Tito? - Rolo, have you seen Tito? - We don't have time! They're coming! Try to open it from here! Julian. Keep monitoring! We have to get the Martian back no matter what the cost! He is the source of our business! He can't be that important! Now that we have managed to dominate the world economy! The global village is ours! There's nothing that can stop us! To the left! Take the stairs! The servers are two flights up! Run! Run! I can't! I can't! Hurry! The guards could fall upon us any moment! Wait, wait. Hurry, hurry! They're getting to the door of the servers! Open up! C'mon! Hurry up! Hands up! VALID PASSWORD PRESS "ENTER" TO PROCEED Get this, damn machine! Freeze! Mummy! Rino, the door. Rino, the door. Rino, the door. - On the floor! On the floor! - We got 'em now! Don't believe that I'm one of those that later disappears! Dude, I hate you! The machines are evil! This is it! Mars! We can get you to Mars! I'm gonna tell my poppa to fire all of you! Boss, we got one of 'em! Idiots! That's my son! What a cute scene! What a paradox! Fathers against sons! Men against the very technology they created! Destroying the technology is suicide! Technology is the key to access a better world! It's a pity they haven't understood this! Into all of the computers we gave, I inserted a little gift of my own: A device that converts every computer into a bomb capable... of blowing up everything in a ten kilometer radius. Stop destroying the computers or I destroy the Earth! I'll destroy the Earth! I'll destroy everything! What's that light? Where is it coming from? Magic ray from heaven shines. Bringing peace. And sowing love. Hey, guys, you're here! Rough time, huh! You were starting to look human! Yes, sorry... I'm so glad you came! See man, for a little bit of Martian snatch. Hey, dude! You're crossing the line there! You can't talk that way to a lady! Goodbye, Mercado! Goodbye, little spaceman. Until our next champagne toast! All our dreams may end if the damn machine explodes! Come on! Let's save the Earth! Destroy the evil machine! Destroy the evil machine! How, how, how? Cut the cable! Cut the cable! Cut! Cut! Cut! But Which one? Which? Which? Which? - The green one! - The blue one! Green! Green! Blue! Blue! Green! Green! Green! Blue! Blue! Blue! Green, green, green green green, green!!! Green! IT WAS THE BLUE ONE
