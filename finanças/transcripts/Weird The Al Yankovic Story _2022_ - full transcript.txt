[gentle music] [Al] Life is like a parody of your favorite song. Just when you think you know all the words, surprise, you don't know anything. [siren blaring] [shouting] [doctor] Clear the way, clear the way! - [nurse] Clear! - [nurse 2] Shut that door, please! [electric shock jolting] [doctor] Clear! [monitor flat lining] Dammit. Dammit! All right, nurse, let's call it. Time of death: 7:30... [screaming] [panting] Quick! I need some paper, and a number two pencil. [Al] But... maybe I'm getting a little ahead of myself. [video rewinding] Why don't we start back at the beginning. [radio static crackling] [radio announcer] All gabardine suits are now 30% off.

[radio static crackling] [whimsical music] ♪ Dr. Demento, Dr. Demento ♪ [Dr. Demento] Whoo-whoo-whoo wind up your radio! It's time for The Dr. Demento Show, two hours of mad music and crazy comedy - from out of the archives... - Alfy! What have we told you about listening to that garbage? But Mom, it's Dr. Demento. It's my favorite show in the whole world. It's going to rot your brain. You're lucky your father wasn't here to catch you, mister. You know how he feels about that kind of music. Yes, I know. All right. Now go on, go get washed up. Dinner will be ready in a few minutes. [soft music] [humming] [sighs] Alfy, aren't you going to ask your father how his day was? Um, how was your day, Dad? What, how was my day? We had another fatality down at the factory. Oh, God, real grisly one this time. It was that McKinley kid that started last week. I kept telling him to stop messing around by that industrial shredder, but he just wouldn't listen. I would've reached out and grabbed him, but I already lost one hand to that cursed machine. Well, anyway, there's an opening down on the factory floor. Maybe I could pull a few strings and you could spend the summer working with your old man. How's that sound? Um, no, thank you. "No, thank you." Well, you're gonna have to learn sooner or later, that factory, that factory will make a man outta you. But I don't wanna work at the factory. I wanna make songs. What? You wanna make songs? Did you hear that, Mary? We got a regular Bing Crosby on our hands, don't we? Nick, you're embarrassing him. Oh, am I? Why don't you sing us a little ditty, Bing, huh? Such a little songbird. Sing one for us. ♪ Amazing grapes ♪ ♪ How sweet the juice ♪ ♪ It tastes so good to me ♪ Stop, stop! What in God's name are you doing? Those aren't the right words. I know. I made 'em better. By changing the lyrics to a well-known song? No, boy, what you're doing is confusing and evil. My God, and I will not have that kind of blasphemy in my own home. But Dad... What has gotten into you, Alfred? Hmm? With the songs and the crazy magazines? That is all gonna stop now, young man! Honey, I know it's hard to hear this, but your dad and I had a long talk and we agreed it would be best for all of us if you would just stop being who you are and doing the things you love. You don't understand me! [door slams] [Al] It was a few weeks later when a mysterious stranger showed up at my door and changed my life forever. [doorbell rings] [Nick] Alfy, get the door. Why, good afternoon, sir. The gentleman of the house, I take it? Well, congratulations. Today is your lucky day. How would you like to be the envy of all of your friends and the most popular fellow in town? Well, everything you need to make that happen... is right here in this box. Um, my dad is actually... - Voila. - [epic music] Feast your eyes. Have you ever seen such a gorgeous instrument? Better yet, try it on. Son, when you play the accordion, you are a one-man band. You are the life of every party. Go ahead, son, tickle those ivories. [horrible accordion noise] A natural talent. Son, you cannot squander that. You have got to buy this beauty, and I guarantee it, you are gonna have girls lined up around the corner. You're gonna need a lifeguard because you're gonna be drowning - in so much p... - Hey! What's going on? And hello to you, sir. What are you doing in my house? And why is my innocent young child wearing that devil's squeeze box? That's actually our newest... I thought I told you to shut up! [glass breaking] I don't remember you telling me to shut up before, but if you're telling me now, I will gladly... [grunting] [groaning] Dad! - [chair breaking] - Ah! [punches landing] Dad, stop! You're killing him! Nick? Oh, Nick, oh, Nick! No, Nick! Hey! Nicky, stop it right now! You made me do this, boy. You brought this evil into the house. And now look at you. Look at you. Take that devilish monstrosity off this very instant. I don't wanna see you ever wearing it again! Nick, why don't you go take a little walk? I think you'd better cool off. - Yeah. Yeah. - [gurgling] I could use some fresh air because it stinks in here. [groaning] I'll be right back. Don't go anywhere. I'll be right here. [Coughs, sputters] Mister, I'm so sorry about this. My husband, he just has a little bit of a temper, but he is a good man and he means well, but anyway, if you're amenable to it, we'd like to buy that accordion. Mom! You mean it? How do you feel about an early Christmas present? Yes! This is the best thing ever! Thank you so much! There's just one thing. No one can see you playing it, especially your father. This is our secret. Do you understand me? Mom... does Dad hate me? No, of course not, sweetie. Then why is he always so hard on me? Listen, you're too young to understand now, but just trust me, your father has his reasons. [sputtering] I think I have a collapsed lung. We're trying to have a conversation here, sir. [Al] For the next few years I kept to myself, and tried my best to please Mom and Dad, but deep down, I felt like I was living a lie. Sure. I was well-behaved, I got good grades, but I never let anyone know the real me. Hey, Yankovic, you going to that party at Hofstadter's tonight? - His parents are out of town. - Ah, geez, guys, I don't know. I'm not really allowed to go to parties. You don't need to have your parents' permission. Just sneak out. I-I don't think I can. My mom always tucks me in in case I have night terrors. [scoffs] You have night terrors? No, I... You know, just in case. Well, just use a hay boy, then. A hay boy? What's that? - You don't know what a hay boy is? - [scoffs] Oh, dude, you've got a lot to learn. Just let us handle everything. We'll pick you up tonight. Okay, yeah. Night-night, Alfy. Don't let the bed bugs give you night terrors. [polka music] [indistinct party chatter] I mean, Myron Floren is great and all, Lawrence Welk sure likes him, but he's way too overexposed. For my money, it's Whoopee John Wilfahrt that really gets me just hoppin' and steppin'. I'm all about that Minnesota sound, man. [gasps] Look what I found! Hey, hey! Hey, you didn't tell me that this was gonna be a polka party. - What, do you not like polka? - No, I like it, it's... My parents would kill me if they knew I was here, okay? I'm so, so sorry, guys. I-I-I gotta go. I can't... I can't be here, man. Come on, Al. Live a little! What's the worse that could happen? You might actually let your guard down and enjoy your life for once? [polka music continues] Yeah, yeah, I can... let my guard down. [music stops] [polka music resumes] Hey... and sorry. Hey, everybody, look what I found! [laughs] Dude, pass it here. Pass it. [playing "Chopsticks"] - Okay, dude. Okay. - [laughter] Al, here. You gotta try this. Oh, no. No, no, thanks. I'm good. Al's afraid his mommy and daddy are gonna find out he tried an accordion. [laughter] I just don't wanna play, okay? Just, just lay off me, man! [“The Chicken Dance” playing] No, guys... - [clapping] - I'm not gonna... [clapping] I'm not... I'm not... I'm not... [clapping] Okay. Yeah, sure. I'll play, yeah. - [clapping] - [laughter] [fast, proficient polka music] [cheering] - It's the cops! Everyone, run! - [sirens] [overlapping shouting] I'm sorry to disturb you, ma'am, but I'm afraid we found your son at a polka party. He was playing an accordion. That's impossible. Alfy's in... A hay boy?! Really? What did I do to deserve this, huh? Huh? It's like I don't even know you anymore, Al. You want me to be like you. Look at me, I'm nothing like you. You want me to work that factory. Okay, I don't even know what you make down there. You just call it the factory. You will find out what we make at the factory when you work at the factory! Well, it's my life, and I wanna make music and I wanna play the accordion. Ah, hogwash! And I'm good. I'm really, really good! How did you get good at playing the accordion, huh? Huh? It certainly wasn't under my roof, was it? What'd you do, sneak out and practice in the woods in the middle of the night? No. I played it here, quietly. Yeah, I play in the closet. But I'm not a closet accordion player anymore. It feels good! The closet, you say? Hmm... No-no-no. Dad, Dad, hey. Hey, hey, hey, Dad. No-no-no. You're not going... It's not in there. You're not gonna find anything in there. Dad, what are you doing? No, no, Dad... No-no-no-no... Dad, no. Dad, please. - Uh-huh? - Stop, stop. - Boy. - Stop. Stop it. - Boy, this... - Please, Dad. Please! No-no-no! This is for your own good, boy. No, I need this, I need this... [yells] [crashing] Nooo! No, no, no, no, no! You... You think you're gonna stop me from playing? You'll see. One day I'm gonna be the best... Well, perhaps not technically the best, but arguably the most famous accordion player in an extremely specific genre of music. I'll show you. I'll show everybody! [Nick] Get out! - Good riddance! - [door slams] [soft music] [Al] Things at home never got any better after that. But within a few years, I graduated and I was able to move out and live on my own. Well, with three other guys in a dirt-cheap apartment, but the point is, I didn't have to answer to anybody. - Hey, hey. - Howdy. [Al] Now I'd have a chance to find others who would truly understand me. I could find my people.

It's the fifth audition I've been kicked out of this week. It's almost like nobody wants an accordion player in their band. That just doesn't make any sense. Yeah. Accordions are cool. That's the problem with being on the bleeding edge. You gotta wait for the rest of the world to catch up with you. I don't have time to wait. If nobody wants to have me in their group, I'm just gonna have to go it in on my own. Don't worry, it's gonna happen for you. You just gotta hang in there. We got your back. Thanks, Bermuda. All you guys. You've just been so great. You really get me. It is such a difference after living with my folks for so long. Yeah. And you know, the best part of moving away from home is you can do anything you want. Hook up with girls... Get high all the time. Yeah, I mean, literally anything. There are no rules. Just last night, I was driving down the wrong side of the 101 with my eyes closed, not knowing whether I was gonna live to see another day or die in a horrible, fiery wreck. Suck on that, Mom and Dad. - Yeah. You get it, Steve. - You go, Steve. Oh, wow, Steve. What about you, Al? What's something you always wanted to do, but you were never allowed to? Make up new words to a song that already exists. - Oh, well, you should do that, then. - [Steve] Absolutely. Yeah. Why don't you do it right now? Go on. Make up something brilliant. No, guys, it's not that easy. I gotta wait for inspiration to strike, and I'm pretty sure that well dried up a long time ago. Oh, well, if you're not gonna write us a song, why don't you make us some sandwiches? Oh, yeah, dude, I'm starving. [all chant] Sandwich! Sandwich! Sandwich! Okay, okay, okay. Guys, I'm on it.

Nobody becomes famous overnight. That's a myth. Sometimes it takes years, decades of hard work to get noticed. - What? - Look, I believe in you. I know it's gonna happen for you someday, but you can't just mail your tape off to some disc jockey and expect to instantly become a sensation. Man, why can't I catch a break?

Uh, my-my-my song was actually a-a big hit on The Captain Buffoon Show. - [laughing] Oh! - What? Captain Buffoon? Really? - Yeah. - [Tony] Wait, wait. Captain Buffoon actually played your song on the radio? Yeah. Why didn't you tell us? This changes everything. Ben, get this young gentleman a record contract this very instant.

Look, I'd just like to say that you got some nerve coming in here and wasting my time and my brother Tony's time. I'm gonna remember your name because you, Al Yankovic, are the most untalented, pathetic loser that I've ever met in my entire life. Okay, um, maybe... You're nothing but a hack, a stupid, useless parasite, - and you're so ugly. - Okay... That ridiculous hair, that horrible mustache, stupid glasses. You make me wanna throw up! All right, thank you. Thank you, Ben. Thank you, Ben, for your, for your thoughts. - Thank you. - Jeez. - Ugh. - Look, kid, if you really have your heart set on doing this stupid music, maybe write more than one song.

Every once in a great while, I can spot a talent that I know is headed straight to the top. Nervous Norvus, Wild Man Fischer, and now... you. What I saw you do on that stage tonight blew my mind! I'm telling you, you've cracked the code. You're onto something special. Wow, I mean, you, you, you have no idea what it means for me to hear you say that. - Thank you so much. - Oh... I only wish the Scotti Brothers felt the same way. Ah, those suits. They couldn't recognize real talent if it slapped them in the face with a dead fish. [Laughs] But I might be able to get them to notice you. How? Well, stick with me, huh? I know a little something about the biz. Uh, wait, are-are you saying you want to be my mentor? No, I'm saying I want to be your... de-mentor! [laughs] But first, we gotta find you a stage name. I mean, Al Yankovic. Ugh, blech. Doesn't exactly trip off the tongue now, does it? I guess not. It's so clunky. It's long. It's ungainly. It's hard to pronounce. Sorry. Now, I'm just gonna throw this out there. Would you be willing to change your name to... Weird... Al Yankovic? I love it. [laughs] Great. Great! Hey, I'm having a little pool party at the house this weekend. I'd love to introduce you to some folks. What do you say you come on by, we'll continue this conversation at the grotto. Yes, of course! Mm-hmm. And don't forget to stay demented! [laughs] You got it. [indistinct party chatter] H-H-Hey! There he is, my newest superstar. Ah, so glad you could make it. I've been telling everyone about you, and, uh, looks like you've brought your band. Okay, fine. Uh, there's some canapés right over there, gentlemen. Help yourselves. So, let me show you around, okay? Everyone's dying to meet you. Oh, right this way. - Uh, Mr. Herman. - [Pee-wee] Hello. I'd like you to meet "Weird Al" Yankovic. Ah, a rising star. Pleased to meet you. [both laughing] And this is, of course, Tiny Tim. Oh, Mr. Yankovic. Oh, why, you're just the cat's pajamas. Is that a good thing? Sure. Ah, excuse us, gentlemen. Nice to meet you. So that's Demento's new protégé. You know, I hear they don't even hand out raincoats and tarps at his shows. Amateur hour. Amateur hour. - Well, hello, Dali. - Andy. What do you think of this "Weird Al" Yankovic? Dali predicts he will change everything we know about art! Weird Al will change the world! Eh, I give him 15 minutes. Well, well, well, if it isn't Dr. Demento. Wolf man Jack. Who let you in here? The Wolf man goes where the Wolf man wants, baby. [howling] Security! Relax. I just came by to lay eyes on this cat you've been paradin' around. The one who takes preexisting musical compositions and completely changes the lyrics. He has a name, you know. And it's "Weird Al" Yankovic. Well then, put 'er there, Weird Al. Oooh! Too slow. What is the meaning of this? This is me telling you that I know hit talent when I see it, and this kid ain't it. He'll never crack the top 40, he's too niche. This kid, as you call him, is the future of music. Right. Well, if he's so great, how about he comes up with a new parody song right now on the spot? - [guests] Ooh... - Whoa. I mean, come on, man. It's a party. I don't know that's a good idea. [John] Do "Another One Bites the Dust." [laughs] That seems fitting, who said that? I did. I'm John Deacon... of Queen. I play the bass in Queen. [crowd] Oh... All right, future boy. Let's hear what you can do with "Another One Bites the Dust." We're waiting. You don't have to prove anything to him. [Jack] Come on, guy from Queen. Let's go find a party with some real talent.

[laughter] - This guy? - Get him, get him out of here! [Al] I felt like I was on top of the world, but this was just the beginning. "Weird Al" Yankovic is one of the most exciting new artists in pop music today. His self-titled debut album was just certified quintuple platinum. [audience cheers] Simply by taking well-known pop songs and changing the lyrics, Yankovic has taken the world by storm. I have never seen a collection of Hawaiian shirts like this. Oh, well, thank you, Oprah! [Oprah] He has the number one album in 20 countries and counts among his fans such luminaries as... Hey, turn this up. [Oprah] ...President Ronald Reagan and Pope John Paul II. Even international drug lord Pablo Escobar calls Weird Al his favorite musician. ♪ Oh, Ricky, you're so fine You're so fine, you blow my mind ♪ - ♪ Hey Ricky! Hey Ricky! ♪ - [guns firing] And what about this, this necklace you're wearing? Oh, these, yeah. I, uh, I wear one solid platinum record medallion for each time my album went platinum. So that's one, two, three, four, five. Wow. Those look heavy. They are super uncomfortable. [Oprah] And it's not just the record company that's cashing in on Weird Al fever. The artists he's parodying are experiencing a phenomenon that's being called the Yankovic Bump. The Knack, Joan Jett and even Queen have seen their album sales double after Weird Al put his unique spin on their songs. Which begs the question, who will be next? Who indeed? Al, you really do seem to have the Midas touch. [Chuckles] I've never seen anything like it in all my years. Your parents must be proud. Yeah. Yeah, my parents... Is everything okay? Huh? Yeah. Yes, of course. Yeah, whose, whose parents wouldn't be proud? [Oprah] Exactly. - Al? Al? - [phone ringing] Hello? - [Al] Hey, Mom. It's me. - Alfy? [Al] It's been a long time, hasn't it? We saw you on the TV. It's crazy, right? Yeah, who would've thought? I'm actually gearing up for a residency right now at Madison Square Garden. Sold out 25 nights in a row. They're, uh, they're moving the Knicks to a hockey rink in Jersey for a month. - Huh. - Yep. Yep. I'm living the dream. I mean, to have 20,000 people every night singing along to my words to other people's music. I feel truly alive when I'm on that stage. [Mary] Oh, that's nice. Are you eating enough bran? - What? - Well, it's important. It keeps you regular and you know how you get when you're not having your regular BMs, Alfy. I... Yeah, sure. Good. That's good. So, um, so how's Dad? Gosh, your father's a complicated man. Does he ever talk about me? Oh, sure, all the time. Yes.
