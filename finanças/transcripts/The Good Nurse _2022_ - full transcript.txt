[distant beeping] [beeping gets faster] - [discordant alarm tone] - [beeping continues] [alarm repeats] [alarm and beeping continue] [nurse] Can I get some help in here? [voice over PA] Code Blue, section 12. Code Blue… [nurse] I need some help, please! [nurse 2] What's going on? [nurse] Came in, he was seizing, then he started coding. - [nurse 2] I'll get the bag. - [nurse 3] What's going on, Charlie? [Charlie] I came in, he was seizing, he went into V-tach, and then he coded. - Let's swap compressions. - [Charlie] Okay. [nurse 3] In three, two, one… - [nurse 2] Good swap. - [PA] Section 12… [nurse 2] Breath, two, three, four… [doctor] Okay, what's going on in here? [Charlie] I heard the alarm from the hall. I came in and saw he was seizing, silenced the vent, noticed he was in V-tach, and then he went asystolic. - [nurse 2] Compressions. - [nurse 3] Watch out. No epi yet. He's about a minute into compressions. Okay. Let's get the epi started, please, and let's pause in a minute for a pulse check. [nurse 3] Copy that. [nurse 2] Breath.

[doctor] He's had enough. Mark the time of death. And let's call his wife. [eerie string music playing] [string chords wail] [music fades] [clunking, metallic scraping] [chatter] [indistinct PA announcement] - [chatter] - [machines beeping steadily] - [patient groans softly] - [nurse] Almost there. [patient] Oh. - How long have you two been married? - Three years. Wow. Couple o' newlyweds. [man chuckles] You know, baby, I love you so much. All right. I have got it. - [man] All right. - [patient] Oh. [coughs] Can we get her some water, please? Sorry, she can't have any until tomorrow. She still might choke. But here. This is gonna make her feel better. - I have to go, but I'll be back. - No. No, you can't go. [man] You know the rules. I'm not allowed to stay. Hey, Sam, this chair reclines. You want a blanket and pillow? [Sam] Yeah. Thanks. Yeah. Okay. I won't tell if you don't. - I'll be right back. - Thanks. You've pushed a liter. I don't understand why his pressure's low. They don't know, but they want another set of labs at midnight. Okay, what about Holly? Holly is stable, but they still need to get... Amy. I'd like to have a word with you about 310. Jeez. You let a relative sleep over? An old man, yeah. He was exhausted, and it was 1:00 a.m. We don't have the staff to run a hotel for relatives. Management has got me rationing coffee filters. Every penny is like a freaking prisoner. I had to beg Linda Garran for extra staff. Right. But I got nights some help, okay? A new guy, tons of experience, great recommendations. - Oh. - [phone rings] Great. - You're welcome. - [phone rings] - It's Viv. - [door closes] [machines beeping, whirring] Hey, Holly, it's Amy. All right, I'm just gonna turn you a little bit. Just put this arm down. Hey, I ran into your sister when I started my shift. She's so nice. Did you guys have a good time together? I can't believe she's got twins. I don't know how… She does that. Okay. One, two, three. [strains] [whispers] Okay, one… [groans] [sighs] Ah… [breathes shakily] [breathes deeply] [inhales sharply] [panting] [chatter on radio] [unsettling music playing] [radio turns off] How was the fried chicken? Did you do the paper bag shake? Yeah, I did the whole thing. Whatever Julia Child said, I did. [both laugh] - [Amy] Amazing. - Um… Uh, I think… you still owe me for last Friday. But… But it can wait, really. Oh no! I'm sorry. [woman] No, really, it's okay. I'm such an idiot. - Okay, 20, 40… - Listen, you really don't have to do this. - I don't need it all. - Six, seven… No, no, no. Eight, nine… Come on. Here, take it. There's 50. Sorry about that. - Thank you. I'm sorry too. - It's yours. [girl 1] Come on, Mr. Teddy. We're going to school! I think we talked about Mr. Teddy not going to school before. - [girl 2] Thanks, Mom. - Come here, Mr. Bag. [girl 2] I'm ready. - Bye. - [Amy] Have the best day. - [girl 1] Bye! - [Amy] Love you! - You need some milk, by the way. - Okay. I'll get it. - See you later. - Thanks. [door closes] [woman] Off to class, girls. [machine beeps steadily] Hmm. [doctor] So it's not the news we were hoping for. Hmm. How bad we talkin'? If you continue like this, you're looking at a serious coronary incident within months, which could be fatal. At the last appointment, you said that there were options. I know, but that was before we got these results. This is now about keeping your heart going long enough. For what? To get you on the transplant list. And you'll have to stop working, take medical leave. I can't. I need health insurance, and I don't get paid leave until I've been there a year. [sighs] You have kids, right? Mm-hmm. Well, you're at high risk for a stroke. You should make them aware of the symptoms. The early warning signs of an episode are breathlessness, pressure in the chest, feeling weak or faint. You need to tell them in case something should happen at home. Okay? - Hi. Loughren. - [receptionist] Mm-hmm. I'm checking out. [receptionist] Sure. - So I see you're not covered? - Nope. [receptionist] With the test and consultation, it'll be $980. Um… Can I split it in two? Sure thing. [rain patters] [woman over speaker] Maria, can you turn me up? Watch TV. …vitamin D. Thank you. [machines beeping, whirring] - Hey. - Oh. - You the new guy? - Ah, yeah, Charlie. Hi, Charlie. Amy. - Oh, hey, Amy. - Nice to meet you. - Welcome. - Thank you. - Did anyone give you the tour yet? - Uh, no, not yet. - I got my patients, but, um… - Okay, come on, let me show you around. The computer's free for all. There's a code to access the bathroom, very importantly, the highly original code 4321. Uncrackable. Ha! Uh, you ever work with PYXIS? Yeah, but I think we had the '97 model. The, um… Huh, okay, come on. Let me show you. Put in your nurse ID. And then your code. You put in what you need. And the amount. [whirring] Take it out. One, two, three, four, five. Close the drawer. - Got it? - Yeah. Uh, they said you had a lot of experience. Where'd you work at before? I've been all over, really. - Florians, Vance, Shawlands, St. Aloysius. - Shawlands. A girl I trained with works at Shawlands. - Oh, yeah? - Lori. - Lucas? - Yes. Yeah, we worked together a lot. She's great. She's an amazing nurse. I haven't talked to her forever. [chuckles] Do they still call her "Pocket Rocket"? No. Oh my God. That's hilarious. I should… I'll call her up and ask her about that. Oh God. Please don't. Don't tell her I told you that. [chuckles] Who'd they give you tonight? Uh… Who did they give me? I have 311, uh, Stevens. 310, Martinez. Do you know their first names? You guys, you don't put 'em on the doors here. You're like me. First names are always better. - Ana. Let's start with her. - Ana. She presented to the ED with an adverse reaction to amoxicillin. Kicker is the prescription was her husband's, so insurance is gonna try to screw them over if we give 'em a chance. - So how's the skin? - Sloughing off at this point. And what, so clears only? Yeah. First sip tonight. Come on. I'll introduce you. Water later. Well, hey there, lovebirds. [chuckles] - Look what I brought. - Hey. Here you go. [weakly] Mm! Is that the best thing you have ever tasted? - Yeah. - Mm-hmm? - [Amy] There you go. - [chokes] [Amy] You know what? Let's start slow, all right? - I wanna introduce you to Charlie. - Hey. He's gonna be your nurse this evening, but, you know, I'm around if you need me. Okay? - So… - How you doing, Sam? Good? You let me know when you've had enough. [Ana] Mm. - Okay, is it burning? It burns? Okay. - I'll check in in a bit. Well, let's take a pause, okay? So, um… tell me, I heard you had a rough couple of days. Yeah? Well, you guys just push on the button if you need anything. Anytime, I'm here. I'm your Amy for tonight. [both chuckle] [machines beeping, whirring] - [knocks twice] - Hey. Hey. Uh, so mine are all settled, so I was just gonna go to the cafeteria, grab some food. - You want something? - Sorry. Cafeteria closes at 11:00. - I should've told you that. - Oh shit. No problem. I'm not that hungry. - Sorry. - No. I'll hit up the vending machines. - Hey, you know what? You like eggs? - Uh… I have a large questionable… [chuckles] …egg salad that I'd prefer to share. - You know, safety in numbers. - I'm fine, thank you. No, no. I'll bring it to the desk when I'm finished with Holly here. - You sure? - Yeah. 'Kay, thanks. I like the croutons. - Mm, you mean the soggy crackers? - That's what they are? That's the real delicacy of the salad. Yeah. My eldest daughter made it. She comes from a long line of women who can't cook. What, so your husband cooks? No, it's just me and my girls. Oh. I have two girls. Uh… Four and seven. Mine are five and nine. - Oh, yeah? - Mm-hmm. I don't live with mine anymore though. Their mom moved, like, six hours away, so… That's kinda why I'm here. - Well, I think this is great. - [chuckles] - Okay. - [alert beeping] - Oh, he's... - 307. Yep. Steven. I have about one minute before he pees. I got it. You sure? Thanks. Hey, Steven. I'm Charlie. I'm afraid Amy's busy right now, so… Can I help? A little problem? [patient chats indistinctly] [girl] Yes, you can! - Look. - [woman] So what? You don't even like her. - [girl] I do! She's my friend, Jackie! - [Jackie] Nobody's gonna notice that. [girl] Everybody's gonna notice! [Jackie] No, they're not. Come on. Really. [girl] Yes, they are! I don't know why I have to keep using these. [Amy] Hey. It's such crap! - Stop it! What's going on here? - You ruined my shoes! I did not! I tried to help you. - Would you mind sitting with Maya? - No, you obviously didn't, Jackie! - She's in the... - That's okay. Why the hell are you yelling at Jackie? - She glued the bottom back on. - It's not a big deal, Alex. - I can scrape it off. - You told her to. Look, it comes right off. - But it's on both shoes. - See? I can take it off. - I'll just... - No, you can't. Calm down. It's not the end of the world. No. - Wait. Hey, hey, hey, hey! Listen. I know. - Stop... I'm trying, okay? I know you don't have as much as your friends, but I'm try... I don't get anything! - I don't even get to have you. - I'm sorr… [door slams] Oh fuck. [exhales] [inhales deeply] [exhales deeply] [machines beeping, clicking] [troubling music playing] [patient moans softly] [bed rails clicking] [breathes shakily] [breathes heavily] [breathing erratically] [groans] [gags] [Charlie] Amy? What's going on? You okay? [softly] I'm fine. Okay, well, I'll just sit here until you feel better, okay? Now breathe with me. [inhales deeply] [exhales deeply] [both inhale and exhale deeply] Keep breathing. [Amy's voice shakes] [Charlie] It's okay. [shakily] Cardiomyopathy. Blood blisters on… on my heart. Okay. So why are you working? I don't have health insurance. What about here? - Did you speak to a cardiologist? - No, please. Okay. Don't tell them. - I'll get fired. - Okay. I'm not gonna tell anyone. - Okay. - Yeah. How much longer do you need to work here before you get your insurance? Four months. Okay. I can help you. Come on. [chuckles] You can do four months. [wheezes, laughs] You're gonna be okay. Yeah? - Are you cold? - Mm-hmm. Here. [gentle music plays] [emergency brake clicks] [car door handle clicking] - Something's wrong with the door. - Oh, it's this. Ah. [chuckles] Thanks. - It's gonna be a long night. - Speaking of energy, how was the park? - She canceled. - No! - Yeah. Moved it to next week. - Oh, that's hard. Called just as I was about to pick up the girls. Yeah. Kind of expected it, to be honest. Uh, one sec. Hey, what's up? Where's Sonya? What have we got? She had a family thing, so I said I'd do her handover. - Uh, 310… - Yeah. …expired right at shift change. - Ana? - [Viv] Yes. Mrs. Martinez. Don't ask. I don't know what happened. The husband was called. He's on his way. 309, he went sideways at around noon… Ana died. [Viv] Should be up around eight. Respiratory came up. They tubed him… - [rain pattering] - [plastic crinkling] [Amy] How could they just leave her like this? My mom died in a hospital when I was a kid. When I got there to see her, it was… Well, first of all, they lost the body. - No. - Yeah. Insane. Just for a couple of hours. But, you know, and then when they did find her, it was this. She was, like, you know, half uncovered, naked… Total mess. For the longest time, that was the memory. That was how I thought of her. Oh, Charlie. So, for me, this is the important part. Yeah. Find some dignity. [knocking on door] Mr. Martinez is out there. He would really like to speak with you, Amy. Go. - You good? - Yeah, I got this. [somber music playing] [no audible dialogue]22 [liquid drips] [man 1] All right, so give me the story again. [man 2] All right, let me see. Suspicious death of Mrs. Martinez, Ana. Presented to the emergency room with adverse reaction to amoxicillin. All right, so? Reacts to some antibiotic. What else? They're not sure. - They don't know what killed her? - No. [radio chatter] How old was she? Seventy-seven. Seventy-seven. So why are we here? [car door slams] [distant sirens wailing] [woman 1] The conference room's right this way. [woman 2] Detectives, Braun, Baldwin, welcome. I'm Linda Garran, risk manager. This is Duncan Beattie, attorney. Our board. You two might know Malcolm Burrel from the City Council. I am a huge supporter of the local force and the district attorney. Ah, well, nice to meet you all. Okay, well, we don't know much. Just that there's been a death. An unexplainable incident in which the patient expired. Okay. Unexplainable how? Well, it's the opinion of the medical experts that this was an unusual adverse reaction to medications. But we found absolutely nothing to suggest this was intentional. Then why call us? We didn't think this was a police matter, but the Department of Health dictates when we should reach out, and here we are. What are the medications? Um… Well, all are listed. [Baldwin] Thanks. [sighs] It's quite a complicated document. I'll take my chances. Well, if you… if you turn to the third page, you can see the window in which patient I had abnormal laboratory results and life-threatening symptoms. Where's Mrs. Martinez's body? Uh, released to the family. They put a lawsuit together? We don't believe that the family are aware of the unusual circumstances around patient 1's expiration. Isn't that something you should've disclosed to them? It was an evolving situation. Park field rightly sought legal counsel to make sure everything was done correctly. Okay, but Mrs. Martinez's body is where? How do we get it? It's our understanding the family have cremated her. When did she die? Seven weeks ago. We were conducting an internal investigation. Hence the lag. Okay. Well, of course we'll need to interview all the staff that works in the ICU. Make way, make way. I am an important person of the town. In fact, I am the most important person of the town, if not the most important person west of the Pecos. [Charlie and Maya] "Wherever that is!" I am the mayor of Humdrum Falls. "So, what do you do?" "Do"? I don't do anything. I'm the mayor. Okay. [chuckles] "Well, you have to do something now." "This may be just a one-horse town without the horse, but it's been invaded by aliens." I'll have to look it up in my book of How to be Mayor. One. You get to wear a fancy chain. Two. You get driven around in a big car by your very own chauffeur. Three… [chomps] Om nom! You eat. It's… "Three. You eat and drink for fr..." [grunts] - I'm never gonna get this part! - Don't get frustrated, honey. Are you kidding? This is great, Alex. No, and the teacher said that I should wear a suit and have a mustache. Dress like a man because I'm the mayor. He said a girl mayor would be weird. Women can be mayors. I told him that, but... It's a play about an alien invasion, and the female mayor's the weird part? - Screw that guy. - [chuckles] - [Jackie] I'm here! - [Amy] Hey! - [Maya] Jackie! - No! You can't go yet. - Oh, sorry, kiddo. - [Jackie] Come on, sweetheart. - Come here. - [Jackie] Guess what I brought you. Okay, take my hands. Repeat after me. I am the mayor of Humdrum Falls. I am the mayor of Humdrum Falls. I am the mayor of Humdrum Falls. I am the mayor of Humdrum Falls. - I am the mayor of Humdrum Falls. - I am the mayor of Humdrum Falls. [both] I am the mayor of Humdrum Falls. [Charlie] You got this. [Braun] Cream and two sugars. They send over that internal investigation yet? Oh, not yet. They say they need more time to compile all the relevant files. Seven weeks wasn't enough of a head start? You'd think. You want me to go through the staff? Already did. One of the nurses had a criminal trespass charge over in Pennsylvania. Oh yeah? A nurse? Yeah, a male nurse. Charles Cullen. C-U-L-L-E-N. Huh. When? Uh, eight years ago. - What district was it in Pennsylvania? - Palmer. - [dial tone drones] - [buttons clack] [line dials] - Palmer Police Department. - Hello, ma'am. I'm Detective Braun with Homicide in the Prosecutor's Office in New Jersey. I need some background on a guy you picked up there in '95. Could you pull the case jacket for me? - Do you have a name for me? - It's Charles Cullen. - Oh, there's a Post-it note on the file. - There's a Post-it note on the file. She's not sure if it's supposed to be there. Can you spell that? It says "digoxin." Digoxin? What is that? A medicine or something? - [indistinct response] - [chuckles] Uh, you got anything else on him? Picked up for trespassing and… Okay. Picked up for trespassing and harassment in '95. Says he slashed a coworker's tires after they broke up. The charges were dropped. - What's that? - Yep, all charges. Charges were dropped? - Yeah. - Oh. Okay, thanks so much. - Yep. - Bye-bye. Something's not right. Park field waited almost two months to report it. Internal investigation you don't wanna share. Expensive lawyers. Okay. Well… What possible reason could they have for covering up a death? Right? What are the motives? It's a business. There's never a better motivation than money when it comes to that shit, right? - [mic feeds back] - [clears throat] Hello? You can keep eating. We won't take up too much of your time. We just wanna make you aware of an event the hospital is looking into. We wanted to assure you all that the board and I are dealing with the incident and everything connected to it. But we thought it best to bring you all together, make everyone universally aware that the police are also involved. - And that... - What is this about? Uh, there's been an issue with a patient's death in the ICU. Was the death suspicious? I mean, if the police are investigating… I wanna be clear. We are investigating with the assistance of the local police. - Do you know which patient? - No. [Garran] But due to the fact that outside investigation is involved, uh, Mr. Beattie, our attorney, is here, and he would like to say something as well. Thanks. Yes, uh, I just wanna say that I'll be discussing with each of you individually, but as a blanket statement to all, I just wanna say that in times like this, patient confidentiality has to be an absolute priority. Your individual contracts are very precise when it comes to this. Anyone speaking to the police without a representative of the hospital present would be in breach of their contract. [crowd murmurs] [clears throat] So at the end of the day, Mr. Beattie and I are here for you. Uh, we wanna be present for any interviews, because we have your best interests at heart. You have full access, but she's gotta be in the room. No. Absolutely not. She can't be in there. That lady's the risk manager. It's her job to be in there. Who's gonna talk if their boss is in the interview? We don't even know what happened. We don't even have a body. The only condition that they asked for is that she be in the room and that you don't talk specific about medications. I understand them asking for it, but why did you give it to them? You're supposed to be the prosecutor. As far as I can see, they're cooperating fully with your investigation. This is all we have. Is this cooperation? [prosecutor] They told me about that. They're getting the documents together. It's done. They're sending it first thing. [Baldwin] Let me ask. Why would Park field conduct an internal investigation, a seven-week internal investigation, then call us in and put her in the room if it was nothing? Due diligence. I'm shutting it down. She's in the room. Done. [sighs] [door opens] Hi, Amy. Hi. [clears throat] Nurse Loughren. - This is Officer Braun, Baldwin. - How you doin'? - What is this about? - [Garran] Just some informal questions. The officers are speaking to a number of staff in the ICU. [Amy] Okay. Do you remember Ana Martinez? Yeah, Ana was my patient. Do you recall anything odd about what happened to her? Odd? [Braun] Well, she died. Yeah, and it was very sad. It was sudden. Sudden? Well, patients die in the ICU, but… We didn't expect it. [knocking on door] [door opens] I don't mean to interrupt. Can I see you for a minute? Excuse me. I'll be right back. This better be important. I wanted no interruptions. You see any deviations there? Mm-mm. Wait, yeah. Her glucose. It's, uh… Yeah, the blood sugars, it's wrong. Uh, there's no C-peps. - That's weird. - What does that mean? Uh, it means that the insulin in her system wasn't made in her body. Someone gave it to her. So you can tell from that that she was given insulin? Well, it's not on the list, and, you know, she's, uh… not diabetic, so the insulin would've been a double medication error, which is really rare, so… A double medication error? It's rare? Yeah. - Would that have killed her? - Sure. [footsteps approach] [Garran] Sorry. - [door closes] - [Garran] Where were we? Uh, let's see. Oh. Can you tell us anything about your coworkers? You don't mind if she answers a question about a colleague, do you, Ms. Garran? - Of course not. - [Braun] Good [Baldwin] We understand that you work with a Charlie Cullen. - [Amy] Yeah. - Could he be involved in this? I think you're jumping to conclusions there, Officer. Charlie wasn't there. I mean, Ana died on the day shift. Charlie and I both work nights. We have no reasons to suspect it was anything other than an accident. Thank you, Amy. I know Charlie really well. We work every shift together, and he's a very good nurse. He wouldn't have made a mistake like that. Thank you, Amy. - So where's that internal investigation? - We're still reviewing everything. Well, we don't need you to review it. We'll just take it as it is. I'll instruct the team to send you the boxes tomorrow. But I hope you can deduce that, um… it's been a tough seven weeks. Eight. It's been eight weeks. - [frantic beeping] - [doctor 1] Jack Ivins. July 19, '88. Recovering from gallbladder surgery on Thursday. There was no complications. [woman] Line in. [doctor 2] Gonna need you to get ready to do another shock, 150 joules. - Everybody clear. - [doctor 3] Clear. [doctor 2] Deliver the shock. Shock. Resume compressions. [doctor 4] One and two and three and four and five and six… - [doctor 2] Compressions. - Nine, ten, 11, 12, 13… [doctor 2] Hold compressions. Let's check for a rhythm. - [doctor 3] I got nothing. - [doctor 2] Persistent V-fib. Resume compressions. Let's get one milligram of epinephrine IV started. [doctor 3] Six, seven, eight, nine, ten… [doctor 2] Let's get prepared to give it another shock, 200 joules. [doctor 1] Epi ready. In line. [doctor 2] Continue your breathing. - [doctor 3] Twenty. - [doctor 1] Keep your compressions. [doctor 3] Talk to me. - [doctor 2] Is that epi ready? - [Amy groans] Swap in, five, four, three, two… - [gasping for breath] - [doctor 3] You're all clear. - Oxygen's clear. - [defibrillation thumps] [doctor 1] I'm moving in. Low pulse, low pulse. - Shit, no pressure, still. - [continuous beep droning] [doctor 2] Four and five and six and seven and eight and nine, ten, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. Shit. Twenty-five. Now! Now! [Amy gasps breathlessly] [doctor 2, muffled] Let's go! - [high-pitched ringing] - [Amy breathes shakily] [droning music playing] [drawer closes] [water runs] Take these. [exhales] [music fades] [softly] You'll get fired. So there's a fault in the PYXIS. So if you cancel a request late enough, it opens anyway. That's stealing meds, Charlie. Amy, stop. Now, please don't worry. I'm gonna help you get through this. [pensive music playing] [keys tapping] [woman] Okay, thank you. Hey, what did he say? [Charlie] I think he's right. I think you probably do need to tell Alex, just in case something happens and I'm not there. They don't have anyone but me. I can't leave them. No, you're not leaving them, Amy. That's not happening. It's… What is it? Two months? Okay, so I'm gonna help you do this. Get your surgery, be with your girls. That's what's happening. Okay? But I think you should tell Alex. [plane whirring overhead] [Amy] I know it sounds scary, but… it really isn't. [Charlie] Everybody's hearts have these ventricles. - They're just these spaces. - Yeah. They're two little spaces like balloons that fill with blood. - They move the blood around the body. - Mm-hmm. And um… mine, they just, you know, they're too big, and they just got a little thin. But I am gonna be okay. I've got medication. I have doctors taking care of me, and I'm gonna feel normal soon. But your mom's gonna need our help, Alex. If she were to fall or, um, you know, start speaking funny, or you struggle to wake her or something, then you just… you put Maya in front of the TV, you call 911, and then you call me. Yeah, but that's not gonna happen. It's not gonna happen. [exhales] [softly] Everything's gonna be fine. I'm gonna be okay. Can I just go watch some TV? Okay. But I'll be here if you wanna… [Braun] Charles Cullen with a C. C-U-L-L-E-N. [man 1] Sure. Give me a second while I pull up his records. Great, thanks. [easy-listening hold music playing] [man 1] Okay, I just need to check something with my boss. Okay. Sure. [hold music resumes] [sighs] [man 2] Hello? Hello. Detective Braun here. Uh, who am I talking to? Mark Rossi. Attorney for St. Aloysius Hospital Group. Mr. Rossi, hi. I'm hoping you can help me out. I'm looking for some information on one of your former employees from back in '96, Charles Cullen. Our employee data is treated with strict confidentiality. I'm just looking to confirm his dates of employment, not much more than that. We'd be happy to release any relevant information as soon as we see your subpoena. Okay, yep, thank you so much. Thank you. This is a fucking joke. Whenever they hear his name, no one wants to say anything. Detective Baldwin? - Yeah. - It's from Park field Memorial Hospital. [Baldwin] It's the internal investigation. - Just need you to sign here. - All right. - Need a hand with the boxes? - No, it's just this. [delivery man] Have a great day. [ominous music playing] - Ms. Garran. - Detective Baldwin. Oh, thank you for seeing me. Anything to help wrap this up. So, I just have a couple of questions. The "Pixie" report. You have all the drug withdrawals... Uh, PYXIS. That's right. Uh, so you've got all of the, um, drug withdrawals for all of the nurses on this? That's correct. Well, I was hoping I could get the full report, because this one only has a short window around Ana's expiration. I'm told it only stores the information for four weeks. Well, you must have gotten a copy during the internal investigation, right? I don't believe we did, no. I mean, I can check, but, uh… everything we had was sent to you. You see, this is page nine, so pages one to eight gotta be around here somewhere. Hmm. - Uh, I'll be sure to look into it. - [clicks pen] Nurse Garran, it's looking a lot like you're withholding some evidence here. - I'm not sure I follow... - Six pages. Where's the rest of it? I'm sorry. I… I have another meeting, and I can't shift it... Oh, I'm not done. I'm gonna reschedule with your office. Sit down. - Excuse me... - Sit the fuck down! [ominous music playing] You know exactly what you're doing. [door opens, closes] - [phone rings] - [chatter] - [Amy] Hey, guys. - [woman] Hey. Um, I know you're not supposed to have babies in here, but I really didn't have anyone else who could take her. - It's okay. - [man] Thank you. - [Amy] What's her name? - Vanessa. Messy Nessie. - Messy Nessie? - [woman] Uh-huh. Well, I have two girls, so I hear that. - Mm. - [Amy] How old is she? Six months. Oh. She sleeping through the night yet? - [laughs] No! - [Amy] She must be teething. - [woman] Oh, yeah. - [Amy] Uh-huh. [all chuckle] - [woman groans] - [knocks on door] Nurse Loughren? It's not urgent. There's a Code Purple in 300. [chuckles] Oh, okay. What's a Code Purple? It means pizza's arrived. Do you want a slice? Oh. Well, I can't say no to pizza. You can't. Unfortunately, though, you're gonna have to say no to pizza. Okay. But you are healing nicely, and will be holding Vanessa in no time. She told me to go fuck myself 15 times on the phone. Oh my God. That's not nice. I haven't even told you the best part. So now, to try and stop me from seeing the girls, she has made up a story about me being mean to her dog. I'm not kidding. It gets better and better. Honestly, the whole thing would be hilarious if it wasn't true. I'm sorry. [Charlie] No. Are you kidding? It's my own fault. I picked a crazy. [both chuckle] [TV character 1] Oh, you know, it works for me. I mean, it's not, like… quickly. - [character 2] Right. - [character 1] What did you say? [character 2] Nothing. Nothing, bro. - [character 1] You said a… word. - [character 2] I didn't. [Amy sighs] [Jackie] Two minutes, girls. Okay. Do you wanna get your backpack and coat? - You want a ponytail for school? - [Alex] Sure. Beautiful hair. I wish we could stay home. I wish that too. - Wanna get your jacket? - Yeah. - Love you. - Love you. [TV continues indistinctly] [Braun] What else is in that? Anything new? Um… Yeah, there was a list of all the medications that were in Ana Martinez's system. - Insulin? - Yeah, and another one. Get this. Digoxin. - Digoxin? - [door opens] [man] Baldwin! - Are you serious? - Shit. Screaming at her. Malcolm Burrel from City Council just called. Danny will be happy to apologize to Mrs. Garran. Well, too late. You've both been banned from the hospital property. What? Can't ban us from the scene of a crime that we're investigating. - [man] What crime? - [Baldwin] Homicide. What do you have to back this up? The files and an interview with a nurse who was certain that the victim was given insulin. Victim, what victim? Ana Martinez. You have no body. No body, no autopsy. You know how this works. [sighs] [door slams] Banned from the fuckin' hospital? [machines beeping] [Amy] Hey, Kelly. Tom called to check on you. I cannot get over how cute that little Vanessa is. Who's Vanessa? Kelly, do you know where you are right now? I need you to answer me, hon. I'm at the hospital. Which hospital? Uh… All right. Squeeze my hands. Come on. Squeeze my hands. A little light. Has Tom come by? He called to check on you. - Hey, Tom, it's Amy from the hospital. - Hi, Amy. What's going on? I really think that you should come in. There's been a change overnight. I think you should come in sooner rather than later. Okay, see you soon. I checked in with Beth. She's still sleeping. - Jack's been pushing on his call button... - Oh my God. What? There's insulin in her system. - [machines beep intensely] - [alarm blares] [PA] Code Blue. Wing West. Code Blue. Wing West. Code Blue. Wing West. [foreboding music playing] [gentle music playing] [exhales shakily] [sobs] [sniffs] Oh my God! Oh God! - No! - [Vanessa groans] [Amy] Mm-hmm. Yeah. [Tom] Oh God! Oh my God! - [Amy, softly] It's okay. - [Vanessa coos] [birds twittering] Shit. Hello. Sorry to bother you like this. Yeah, no. We need your help, Amy. Look, I'm sorry, guys. I… Really, I don't know what happened to her. To who? Kelly Anderson. I… I mean… Who's Kelly Anderson? [Baldwin] Is there another victim? Another double-medication error? Was Cullen with Kelly Anderson? This has nothing to do with Charlie. - How well do you know him? - Really well. [Baldwin] Do you? He's been at nine hospitals. And none of 'em will talk to us. What do you mean? I'm… No. If something had happened, he wouldn't have been able to get a job. - The hospital would have done something. - You'd think so. Yeah. They're stonewalling us. You have to help us. [door creaks] Mom, are you coming? Hey, honey. Yeah, I'll be in in a second. Just wait inside, okay? Okay. [softly] Guys, I can't talk right now. My kid's here. Like… Okay. Here's my card. Give me a call. Maybe he's not who you think. Have a nice day. [Braun] Thanks. [ominous music playing] [car doors close] [Charlie] Hey. [Amy] Hey. - Do you need anything? - Mm-mm. - No? - I'm fine. Okay. You let me know if you feel tired. I'm not. I will. I feel good. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Okay. - Mm. [machine beeping, whirring] [eerie music playing] - [bell dings] - [pop music plays over speakers] [bell jingles] [woman] Amy fucking Loughren! - [Amy] Pocket Rocket! - Mm! [chuckles] - [Lori] It is so good to see you! - [Amy] I know. You look so good. - Really? - Yes! You look great. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - I feel exhausted. - [server] Hi there! You ready to order? - Oh, I'll have a cheese omelet. - Okay. - And what pairs best with that? - Chardonnay. Oh. A large cold glass of dry chardonnay. - Okay. - I'll have the same. - Thanks. - Coming right up. When was the last time we were in this dive? A long time ago. Like, at least a decade. - What? - Twelve years? - Ugh, Jesus. - [Amy chuckles] - I'm getting old. - [server] Here we go. Thank you. How's Paul? Uh, we split up. - Oh shit. - I mean, it's not a big deal. It was a long time ago, and we share custody of the dogs. [Lori chuckles] We worked hard to come to that agreement. I'm so glad that you called. Mm! Me too. [chuckles] Just, you know, I wanted to… I wanted to ask you… It's… It's a little weird. I love weird. But, um… do you remember working with someone named Charlie Cullen? - Yeah. - Yeah? Why? Well, I'm working with him right now at Park field. There was a rumor about him. That he was responsible for a death. That he OD'd someone. Oh. Uh, with what? They found insulin in the dead guy's saline bag.
