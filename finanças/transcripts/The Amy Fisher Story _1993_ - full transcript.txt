Amy Fisher is a cold blooded person. Who has no heart No conscience, No soul. She looks like an angel, She's a small, petite girl. She's the devil. If you had anything to say to her parents, what would you say? Oh god... parents. I'd feel sorry for them. I have two children of my own, I do feel sorry for what they're going through, the suffering that this child of theirs has caused them. But on the other hand, They maybe should have been a little bit tougher with her. I wished her parents would get her some serious psychiatric counseling, Because I felt she needed it, desperately.

My pleasure Sir. See you in a couple of days. See you too, Amy. Everything is gonna be OK. It's all gonna be OK. This morning, Amy Fisher, 17 year old high school senior from Merrick. Was arrested and charged, with the attempted murder of housewife Mary Jo Buttafuoco. An unidentified male who drove her to the house, is still at large. Mrs. Buttafuoco was shot one time in the head, and was not expected to survive. This morning, doctors are saying it's a miracle she made it through the night. She was able to describe her assailant to a team. That's it. Come on, seven. Why did the kid shoot her? Yeah! The case is obviously still under investigation. But it seems, Mrs. Fisher may have had a relationship with Mrs. Buttafuoco's 36 year old husband. Joseph Buttafuoco. What kind of relationship? Mr. Buttafuoco is the family's mechanic. Mrs. Fisher and he became friends, And some time last summer, a sexual affair blossomed. Now we believe, Mrs. Fisher became obsessed with him. And tried to kill his wife. It was a near fatal attraction. knows young woman taken advantage of by an older man. Things go wrong, bam bam bam. Tragedy! It's a hot story. And so is the presidential campaign, and I got the conventions coming up. Come on, Clinton doesn't stand a chance, but this, This is a fatal attraction shooting. Great, she's being charged with a movie. Obsessed, Mixed up teenager. Gets Angry Gets even. Look, 16 year old white girls from Long Island, do not go around shooting house wives. What do you know about the boyfriend? The victim's husband. Buttafuoco. Uhh, he and his Dad own a garage. Apparently, Amy Fisher was very accident prone. And he fixed her car. A lot. Hi, it's me. I need to hear a friendly voice. I don't know, it's kind of boring here. People are nice, I guess. Let's go. I think I screwed up. I think I really screwed up. Gonna hang up. Yeah, she was always crashing that car. I'm pretty sure she really loved the guy, and I guess he didn't realize what he was getting himself into. I heard that they have actually gone to a carnival. A local carnival. He even went and brought his kids with her. She even joked once that the kids called her "Aunt Amy". Yeah, she used to walk into my class, and everyone would be like: What is Amy gonna wear today? You know? Yeah, so nice, tight clothes. Yes. But, what Amy wore wasn't the only thing kids talked about at school. When we return, we'll talk to one of Amy's friends. A friend who knew how far Amy's love for Joey Buttafuoco really went. She told me he was "hots" and very experienced. I mean, this is it. This was the guy that Amy wanted. Do you think that Amy's parents knew about Joey? Beats me, I mean she... never really talked about them much. Well, I mean, they gotta be pretty stupid not to. I mean, Amy was devoted to this guy. She even wore a beeper so he could call her any time. A beeper? Sure, I mean, I saw it. Well, I don't know if it was really so he could call her, but that's what she says, so. And I've heard other things, too. Yeah? Like what? Mrs. Buttafuoco, could you describe to the grand jury in your own words, what happened to you? Was like my head was exploding. Hi Mrs. Naiburg. I wish you would start calling me Eric. Like we're friends? Like we're going to be working together for a while, please. OK. Let's get started. So, you met Joey when? I heard you used to make budget finger beds. Is that true? Please try to focus here, understand something? If I'm going to help you, You have to help me. So, you and Joey. The kind that vibrate, right? We have to talk about this. I know it is going to be unpleasant. You're talking about Joey? I love talking about Joey. So you were how old when you first met him? How old do you want me to be? Sorry I asked. Sixteen. And already you got a car. I'll bet your Daddy bought it for you. Maybe. I'll bet he buys you everything. Can we not talk about him? That's fine with me. That's 300 for the pinstriping. What were you like when you were 16? I don't know, normal. So, uh... what do you want? Red or pink? Normal, like you had a girlfriend? Like I had a wife. You were married at 16? You ask a lot of questions. I'm curious. So was the cat, and look what happened to her. I'll take my chances. I was 21 when I got married, but I was 16 when I first knew Mary Jo and me would be together forever. Mary Jo and I. Ohhh, a smart aleck. That's a long time. You must really love her. Yeah. I'm a happily-ever-after kind of guy. That's funny, because I happen to believe in fairy-tales myself. Pink. Huh? Pinstriping. I want it pink. And whatever Amy wants, Amy gets. You got it. Alright. How old are they? There? Six and Nine. They're cute. They're lucky to have each other. I wish I had a sister or brother. Only child? Must be tough. No wonder they spoil you. You must be a good father. I do what I can do. It's more than most. How soon do you need it back? Why? It's gonna take a while. I don't know, I'm in no hurry. No hurry at all. That is totally the sexiest thing I've ever felt. Do you think my body needs building? Kiddo, what you've got. Doesn't need no improvements. You've known Mary Jo a long time. I told you. Since high school. Oh, I get sick of a guy after a month. Maybe you haven't found the right guy yet. Well, all my friends date older guys, you know, in their twenties and stuff. Wow... Twenties, huh? That's ancient. Well, how old are you? On your scale: I'm dead. Well then you look pretty good for a corpse. I got scars older than you. So, You're into these ancient types too or what? Ahh, I don't know, maybe. You ever been with an older guy? Not exactly. You mean you're not sure? Well, the first time I ever had sex, I was 12. Get outta here! No, I'm serious. This guy came to put in a tile in my parents house. Frank. He had his name stitched on his shirt. And he was older than my Father. Anyway, Things just sort of happened and we did it. It wasn't that great, though. That's sick. Ah, him I mean. You would never let anything like that happen to your Daughter, would you? I'd kill the son of a bitch. I protect my family. No one hurts them. No one. That's what I thought. I don't know, Amy. This is gonna cost you big time. Looks like you bent the axle. Is that more than last time? It's more than all the other times put together. My father is gonna kill me. Look, You want me to talk to him? No, what good is that gonna do? You backed into a pole, right? So maybe, I tell him that this kind of damage came from some hit and run slop. You'd do that for me? Nobody saw you do it, so... no problem! You just saved my life. It's all in a day's work. How can I repay you? Easy, don't. We're friends, right? You're so cool, I could just kiss you. Please, I'm an old man. I'll be gentle. Don't start something you can't finish. So when did you first sleep with him? You're anxious, aren't you? A month, would be good. Month, I remember the day. The minute. The whole thing. July 2nd 1991 You need a lift? Yeah. That would be great. I always wanted to see your house. You're parents home? No. No, they're not. Thanks. Man it's hot. Bet you have air conditioning? No. I hate heat. Me too. Don't laugh. It's very effective. See? Nice and cool. You want me to blow on you, too? If that would make you happy. Thanks. This is everything I've ever wanted. This one was like being at the rits. Oh, it's a lot better than the back seat of a car. You're the most incredible lover I ever had. Better than some pimply faced teenage kid, right? OK, look. The next time we're together, I can't promise a sweet or nothing. But maybe we'll go some place special. And what makes you think there will be a next time? Oh, let's just say, I have this real strong feeling. Where? Do you want that I show you? Where are you gonna take me? Dinner maybe. Or maybe I'll take you to my boat. Would you like that? Sure, I love boats. Or maybe... I'll buy you something. Something nice, to wear. Well, how will you know what I like? The point is: I don't buy for you. I buy for me, what I like. Damn, you got a lot to learn, Kiddo. A lot. Well, I could be a good student. God, you're beautiful. Well, I don't know. What are you doing today? You're Mom says you should get out of bed. Get, outta here. God... He never knocks. What am I wearing? Well, I'm wearing a t-shirt, and under that I have--- Nothing. Do you want me to describe it for you? I... Love... You. That's nice. That's real nice. Alright, alright. Here's another one: Alright. A: Amy. Now you get it! Now, But--- Buttafuoco? Amy Buttafuoco?! Forget it. Forget I did that. You have a lot going on. So, I guess you and Mary Jo don't have the perfect marriage after all, huh? Aint no such thing. Would you ever divorce her? You want some? Would you? You know, it's important to dring at least 8 glasses of water a day. You know that? I'm serious. I'll bet you've only had 2. Maybe 3 tops. Don't change the subject. Don't push me. I'm here, now. That's all that matters, right? Yeah... for now. He loved me. He said that? He just did. Joey loved me. OK. Pretty exciting stuff, huh? Are you excited, Eric? And tell my Mother's attorney I'm not wearing my hair back. According to Mrs. Fisher, she stayed with Mr. Buttafuoco because he made her promises. According to Amy. And who said she isn't lying? I do. Mary Jo! Is there anything you'd like to say to us? Please. For just a moment please. Police are still looking for the unidentified male who drove Amy Fisher to the Buttafuoco home. For just a moment please. Police are still looking for the unidentified male who drove Amy Fisher to the Buttafuoco home. On a more positive note: Mrs. Buttafuoco--- Hey, I was watching that! Shh. According to her attorney, Mrs. Buttafuoco did not know Mrs. Fisher, nor the reported affare between Mrs. Fisher and her husband. Yeah, right... Shut up Davis. We take out business, so we don't worry about this when we take out pleasure. Are those stretch marks? Did she just ask if that guy had stretch marks? I don't like to think of business and pleasure at the same time. Now, what you're saying--- Are you gonna take that off? I don't know, you wanna know? Take it off and then turn off the lights. Not the words of a child. Though it's true she might have been one, once. And now the term "Lolita" is being applied to Amy Fisher, as if this alone, would let grown men off the hook. But while Amy may have been willing to have sex with an older, married man is spirit, It does not make her willing, under the law. It is by law: statutory rape. There's a transcript. Thanks. And it all worked out don't ya? Except here. How does it end? Now give me the summer... I didn't pay a thousand bucks for that tape for nothing, you know. Yeah, the tape. Would you have shown that tape if Amy had been 13? Sure. Really? What if she'd been... 11? Probably. What about 5? If the girl prostituting in that tape would've been 5, would you have broadcast it? No... come on. Face it: we're all whores. Amy Fisher, the guy on the tape, me, you. We're just trying to make a buck. I'll wait. This is a side street, you can't go in here. Amy Fisher... On May 29th 1992, The Grand Jury, The County Of National, State Of New York, indicted you for the crimes of attempted murder in the second degree. Criminal use of a firearm in the first degree, and armed felony. Assault first degree. 2 counts, one count of which is an armed felony. Criminal possession of a weapon, in the second degree, and armed felony. And... criminal possession of a weapon Third degree, and armed felony. How do you plead to the indictment? Guilty or not guilty? Not guilty. Your honor, The evidence that we have that we can prove against this defendant, totally disproves any theory that this shooting was an accident. There are injuries to Mrs. Buttafuoco's head that are consistent with her being struck by a weapon or anything else. The only injury To Mrs. Buttafuoco's head is a single gunshot wound to the right temple. Totally inconsistent with an accidental discharge of a gun. There is strong evidence, that this defendant tried or attempted to kill Mrs. Buttafuoco on several occasions. There's no reason to believe she won't try again! I suggest to your honor, and the court. the likelihood of flight of this defendant, and this case is astronomical. If she worked for an escort service, and was so Brazen, and so manipulative that she attempted to even cut out the service. By wearing a beeper so her customers could contact her directly. One might describe this defendant as a 17 year old. Who lives at home with her parents, and goes to high school. This would be as accurate your honor, as describing John Gaddy as a businessman from New York City. She is completely beyond the control, of a parent, of the school, and of this court. Thank you for your time. Anything further? Yes, I have a little further, judge. He knows full-well who put her into prostitution, Mr. Buttafuoco, is the Pimp, who put her into that business. bail is set for the defendant, in the amount of 2 million dollars. Never a dull moment, huh? Two million bucks. Looks like the ape is just stuck in her cage. Unbelievable. Hell, that preppy murder guy, Chambers, he only got 200 thousand for bail, and he killed somebody. Hey, that's really good. I forgot about him. Robert Chambers. We were working like this, uh. Not since the preppy murder cases. The crime so captured the imagination of New York City. Just wait for a hard copy. Maybe then they'll raise Amy's bail to 3 Million. Hey, I'm not the prosecutor here, I didn't make that tape. No, she's Long Island's "Lolita", Brazen and manipulative. And definitely a ratings getter. Two million dollars, for a 17 year old girl with no previous police records. He's an absolute threat. Last year, Rome Paris described her in a missing persons report, as Uncontrollable, unstable, violent, and extremely dangerous. Amy, Amy, was that you on the tape? Amy, who was driving the car? So, same as last time? 150? 185. You're not worth it. It's not what you said last time. Hey, listen. I'll make you a deal, I like your jacket. If you give it to me, I'll take 50 bucks off. And that's fair, isn't it? Hi Muffin, come here. I'm done with my chores. Can I go now? Apart from its architectual achievements of Egyptian art. Another important factor was.... [BEEPING] A type of sculpture that we tend to take for granted today. Next time call me directly, you'll save a few bucks. No kissing. Is it true blondes have more fun? There's a shadow of a woman in her... I got a... Hey! Buttafuoco. Hey. Hey hey hey hey, I'm trying to listen here. Buttafuoco? Yeah, no kidding. You work for the Buttafuoco's? Joey Buttafuoco? Yeah, I'm the gardener. And I can tell you first hand: when the cat was away, the mouse would play. Oh--- Really? Oh, please. Oh, Howard. Hey, I saw Joey and Amy going at it in the pool whenever Mary Jo was out. Pool?! Oh, hey hey. It's getting rather hot in here. I'm gonna have to take my pants off just to cool down. What pool? Oh, that could cool us down, Howard. Except, that might drive Robin really crazy. Hey, Pal Joey, wait till Mary Jo realizes you were cheating on her, She's gonna kill you. Howard! I wasn't cheating on my wife. Oh, remember: this is live radio, you're under oath. I'm faithful to my wife. Mary Jo is my high school sweetheart. Aha. And I'm the Pope--- You know, I've been dying to be with a 37 year old my whole life, I've finally got one. I mean, what the hell am I gonna go with some 16 or 17 year old throwback, huh? Let me think about that for a minute. But didn't she come to your house, Joey? Busted. That's insane. You know, when my kids heard that report, Where she claims to have said that they called her Aunt Amy, My 12 year-old boy went nuts. Ah ha. Well, let me get this straight. So you're claiming that the papers are lying when they called you Amy's lover. Absolutely, yes. Howard, you're getting a first. I don't cheat on my wife. Hey, robin. I need a tissue. Send in the violin... So, on the record, as Joey Buttafuoco's lawyer, you're telling me he never had an affair with Amy Fisher. I'm telling you that is a fact. Never slept with her, not once? Amy Fisher was a customer of Mr. Buttafuoco's. Oh, sure. They ate pizza together once. It was nothing like the way she remembers it. There was nothing between them, period. So? So... I don't know. Look, my Dad will kill me if he knows I crashed again. Your Dad is a good customer. Only 'cause I'm a lousy driver. Don't forget how you get that money. Don't tell him. I can't do it Amy, it's not right. Thanks, see if I ever help you out sometime. There was nothing else between them. He was not her lover. Ha, he was certainly not a pimp. To call him that is blatantly slanderous. Look, she came into my shop a lot. She was smashing up her car all the time. Heh, now I know why. She told me stories. Like how she slept with a tile man when she was 12. I never knew she was a whore. I never knew she was nuts. Th- that's what my wife kept asking me. Couldn't you tell she was nuts? And the truth is... I never did. Joey, I need you to do this for me, I need you to cover. What do you mean: "cover"? What is that supposed to mean. Look, I have a towel, now they want to know who gave it to me. Just say it was you. What are you, crazy? I hardly know you! I don't know what else to do! OK, well tell him the truth. You got it off one of your boyfriends. They hate the guys I date. Well then, tell them you got it off a toilet seat. You don't get herpes like that. Look, Joey. I kept this towel. I don't know who I got it from. They'll think I'm a slut. Joey, please! Forget it. Look, you've made a lot of money off me. You owe me. I am not getting involved! That's what you think. I was never involved with Amy. On any level. Period. I don't believe you! He's lying. What do you want us to do about it? Call the police? No... Alright, I'm a liar, I'm a big, fat liar. I'm sorry you got dragged into this. That's OK, Mr. Fisher. But, I'm a married man, I got kids. I can't have this kind of talk getting around. Thanks for coming over. Look, people hate me. My wife doesn't believe I had an affair with this girl. But, even if I did! Even if I was somebody else. That's no reason to shoot a guy's wife in the head! I have been made a victim here. First by her, then by her lawyer. Now, by the press. I'm standing behind my Joey, i believe in him. Now all these things they're writing about cheating, infidelity. These things are lies. All lies by a sick, sick young girl. Only Joey and I know the inside story. And it's a pretty simple story. I love my Joey, my Joey loves me. And he would never ever, cheat on me. Mr. Pitcher called the District Attorney's Office, and said Amy was having an affair with an older, married man. So we suggested he'd come down, and file a statutory rape complaint. But he said he couldn't. He was afraid that Amy might run away. That he'd lose her. Hey, who is that guy with Klein? It's Chris Drellos. On of Amy's old boyfriends. Goodbye, good looking! Bye! He's madly in love with me. Do you have any gum? No. He's gonna marry me, as soon as he gets divorced. What, he's married? Well, he loves his wife. And I love the fact that he loves her. It takes that kind of devotion to make a marriage work. It just making planning out future a pain in the ass. Yeah, you could say that. Hey, listen. Do you know where I could get a gun? Maybe, why? You still like me Chris, don't you? Yeah, but... It's no reason to shoot me. I'm serious. You want me, I want a gun. Maybe we could work out a trade? Why do you need a gun? Well, let's just say Mary Jo won't go quietly, it might come in handy. That's uh, that's funny. Bet he could tell us a few stories. I think my favorite touch is the: "Who do you think is to blame?" 900 number. They have every right to tell her side. People don't make statements to the police anymore, do they? They just go off and sell their stories to hard copy. They go on the Howard Stern show. And the attorneys, gees! Everyone in the whole damn story has an attorney. Amy, Joey. Mary Jo, the Fishers, Sleeman. Sleeman! What time is it? It's 14:00 o'clock. Damn! He's giving his statement today, later. Bye! Hey, wait up! When did you first meet Mrs. Fisher? Can I answer that? OK... I met her in August. She was a friend of a friend of mine. What friend was that. A guy names Chris. Chris Drellos. Uh, Steve! This is Amy. Amy, this is Steve. So, Chris says you're like the chef here or something. Yeah, something like that! I like to cook too. I gotta go. So, are you gonna help me, or what? You can stay. But don't touch. What is her deal?! I told you, she's driving me nuts about this gun thing. You're the only person I knew who has one. Oh, like I'm gonna give it to her?! Who said you had to? Just tell her that you're gonna give it to her. I don't know. Look, man. You'll be doing both of us a favor. I want her off my back. You wanna get laid. Now, if you just go along with her... You'll get all the sex you want! Nice car! Thanks, I totaled my other one. You know what I could really go for right now? Eggplant Parmesan. Do you know how to make that? Huh? I love Italian food. Will you make it for me sometime. Look, I thought we were gonna go somewhere. We're here. I meant somewhere private. You see that house? That's Joey's house. Needs repainting. A light shade of blue, maybe gray. Not that Mrs. Buttafuoco has bad taste, it's just not my taste. I want you to start following her around. Why?! Because I said so. You didn't say please. P L E A S I'll be back honey, I've got errands! What do you think you're doing? Sleeping! You're supposed to be watching Mary Jo. I was! She hasn't gone anywhere. See, that's her car! Where did she go before here? Nowhere! Well, what was she wearing? I don't know! Pants, shorts or something. Well, did she look good? This is not worth it. Understand something here, Steve. Joey is the only man I love. And I will do whatever it takes to get his wife out of the way. So is it worth it? You bet it is. And if it's worth it to me... then it's worth it to you. Call me when you get the gun. I'm sick of you jerking me around. Get your gun, we're doing it now. Yes. Hi, um. I'm selling candy for my school and I was wondering if you'd buy some. Candy, oh... This house is full of Halloween candy. No thank you. Well, you see, I have this quota and--- Well, I do appreciate that but, no. Look, I haven't sold any all day. They're only a dollar. Alright, let me get my purse. Why didn't you shoot? I couldn't see her. She was right there! Where are you going? Home! You're a wimp, I want my money back. You're a psycho! I'll call you. She kept calling for months. Every time, the same thing. Get me a gun, I need a gun. I gotta get rid of Mary Jo. Then what happened? It stopped. She called to say she didn't need me any longer. She found somebody else, who'd get her what she wanted. Mm hmm, listen uh, just out of curiosity, why didn't you come foward, before. I mean, you knew Amy wanted to kill this woman. And yet, you didn't say anything. You did nothing to stop her. I got that... immunity thing, right? Uh, huh. I didn't know she was serious. You know? I thought it was a joke or something. Mr. Sleeman, Mr. Sleeman! Amy Paknosy, the post. Please, just a couple of questions. Just basic, a couple questions. Very simple questions. Multiple choice. Hey Steve, yo! Steve! Or if another time would be better. Damn. We're not gonna have anything to write about. Don't lose sleep over it. Sleeman is going on Carna Fare tonight. He's telling the world what he told them in there. I'm sure I'll have plenty to write about. After all efforts to lower miss Fisher's bail have been rebuffed. We are offering exclusive rights to her story, to whomever can come up with the 2 million dollar bond. This could propel Amy Fisher from a 180 dollar a night prostitute, to a 2 million dollar a night prostitute. We are currently talking to several producers. As well as television shows who are interested in interviewing her. And what if some movie company bails her out? Who is to say she won't go after my wife again. Publicity is Amy's only asset. Joey, do your kids ever ask why their mother was shot? Yes, they do. And I tell them there are good people, and there are bad people. They watch television. They know what I'm talking about. Martin Tankleff killed both his parents. And got out on 1 million dollars bail. Are you telling me that he was less of a threat than Amy Fisher? Amy Fisher is a flight risk. She has a history of being a runaway. In my opinion, 2 million dollars is too low. Well, what about Sleeman, an admitted participant in trying to kill Mary Jo, and he doesn't report it to the police. You grant him immunity, While Amy is held up on the highest bail is Nassau County for attempted murder. Apples and oranges. We needed Mr. Sleeman's testimony. Oh, and is that why you haven't brought statutory rape charges against Joey, because you need his testimony? That is absolutely untrue. Come on Klein, you know this is about some weird judicial double standard. I don't have time for this. Amy's two million dollar bail is not for shooting Mary Jo. It's punishment for sleeping with a lot of men. For being a prostitute. Hell, if she had just shot Mary Jo, she'd already be out on a lot less bail. You are on the line! Who is that boy? Peter Guagenti. Police say he drove Amy Fisher to shoot Mary Buttafuoco, They've been looking for him for weeks. Oh. Who is uh... Amy Fisher? OK people, we have one hour to finish the finals. Come on here! Santa, this is Tiffany. Oh, hi. Have you been a good little girl? Where were you last night? You scared me to death. I waited for you to call! Uh, I had things to do. You couldn't even call? What kind of things? Ahh, please. What? Like shopping, or, painting your house? Or maybe you were having sex with your wife! I was decorating a Christmas tree, alright? So you were with Mary Jo! I was with my family. Why? I like spending time with them. I love them. More than me? Oh, look. This is getting out of control! I mean, it's the holidays. I want to be with my family. We can't see each other. See each other as much, you mean. No, I mean I'm thinking it's time we should call it quits. Nooo, no no no no, I need you! Oh, come on, Amy. I love you, Joey. Look what I bought. I bought this, it's what you like. And I bought this too. Put that away. You said we'd always be together. I never said that. You know, And if you need some time because it's Christmas and stuff, I understand. Just don't say it's over. Don't say it's over. Don't ever say it's over! Alright, let's put this one together. Put this piece over here, and then this one over here. Take this piece, and put his here. Here they are, Honey. Then we take this piece, and we put this piece over here. Paul? Hi. Hi yourself. Joey Buttafuoco said I should come see you. Said that you're the best trainer here. Joey, yeah yeah yeah yeah. You're a friend of his? Kind of. My name is Amy. He said you could train me. Train you to do what? You're funny. "Train me to do what"... Paul has been working on me really hard. That came out wrong, not that you care. You're right, I wouldn't. Hey listen, about going to the prom together. I know it's not for a few months, but I thought--- The prom? Are you nuts? Hey, what are these? We had them made up for our best customers. Here take one. You're definitely on our top 10 hit list. Thanks. Because of his wife. If it wasn't for her, We'd definitely be going to the prom together. Oh, God, I hate her. You know, Joey don't work out here no more. He's jealous! Of what? What do you think? Not exactly shy, are you? Why should I be? When I know what I want, I go for it. Let's get over here and try some half squats. OK. Why would you time with a married guy? Why do you think? Because he fixes my car. I love him. And I looove the sex. Is there a problem? Great. So that's why? Alright, I'll be there as soon as I can. Bye. Let me see it. Where did you get all this? What difference does it make? I'll be right back. Hi, are you Mary Jo Buttafuoco? Yeah, can I help you? Can I talk to you for a sec? Uh Huh. Drive! What the hell did you do? Just drive the damn car. Indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Dennis Davidson. Kim Everet. Ruth Fawcett. Erik N. Fitch You OK? Take your time. Number three. Are you sure? Hi, are you Mary Jo Buttafuoco? Yeah, may I help you? Can I talk to you a sec? It's not every day that I confront a wife. What are you talking about? My little sister is having an affair with your husband. Oh, really? Yeah, well. I think the idea of a 40 year old man having an affair with a 16 year old girl is pretty disgusting. Well, he's not 40 yet. What's your name? Ann, Marie. And where do you live, Ann Marie? In Ba Harbor. Honey, Ba Harbor is over there. Now where do you really live? On dolphin court. And who is that? My boyfriend. I think you better go home. I have proof. I found this in my little sister's bed. He hands these out all the time, it doesn't prove anything. I'm gonna call him. Number 3. That is her. The woman is vilified as a witch, of course, while the men aren't even prosecuted. Subtle Peg, that was very subtle. Glad you like it. 1986 Nassau County 17 year old Joseph Porto, took a rope, twisted around the neck of the high school sweetheart and wanted to jump him under she had no life in her. Funny, nobody in the Nassau County's prosecutor's office ever compared Joseph Porto. To john Ghatti. Amy Fisher, a minor with no prior record is charged with attempted murder, a B felony. For which 2 million dollars in bail might appear to be extraordinarily high But just like another gangster, Al Capone, Who had to be nailed on tax evasion, Amy's clean record, proved her invidious influence. Bail stands, at 2 million dollars. This godmother is untouchable. At least, she was. Until a growing line of adult men started saying they touched her, and how. For cash and/or immunity. Should Fisher turn out to be the demon seed prosecutors have painted her as, she should pay dearly for her crimes. But whether the DA will be able to separate her alleged crimes from her sexuality, remains to be seen. It sure doesn't look good for her so far. Your honor. It has come to our attention, that some of Mrs. Fisher's bond is being put up by a movie company that is securing their rights to her story. In light of this new information, we ask that you reject the bail arrangement. It is against the public policy of the state, to profit from how they committed a crime. Does this mean that I'm not gonna be able to go home? Your Honor, My Client is presumed innocent until proven guilty. In the eyes of the law she has not committed a crime. It is one of the fundamental precepts of our judicial system. While I am allowing you to go free on bail, Mrs. Fisher. You are prohibited from any contact with Mrs. Buttafuoco. Any attempt to make contact, will result in the immediate revocation of bail. Do you understand? Yes. Amy, what are you gonna do tonight? Look at her, she lost 20 pounds in jail. We're gonna take her out, buy her a nice italian dinner, and toast her. Thank you very much. All I can say, is I hope her parents Get that girl some serious psychological help. She is a sick girl. A very sick girl. Mary Jo, are you afraid? I'm very frightened, yes. I don't think I'll ever feel safe until she's behind bars. Her lawyer says that they're taking her for Italian food tonight. Oh, really? Well, I haven't had any food since this happened. I've been living on baby food. So you tell her to take a bite for me. And so, she calls me from the jail, and tells me uh I need to hear a friendly voice. And if she's all screwed up. I think I screwed up. I think I really screwed up. I gotta go. You already told this to the papers. Yeah, yeah. But that's print. Look, I, I was thinking TV. You know, living color. I could like, do an interview with you or something. It's old news, forget it. Wait wait wait wait. What if I could get you something new? Something, something to show the other side of Amy Fisher. It would have to be something no one has seen before. And if something happens. If something happened, you'd be interested, right? I'm a journalist, Makely. I'm always interested in a good story. You must be happy to have Amy back. Yes, we are. So, uh... Her trial isn't for a while. No, it's not. Well uh, I'm sure everything will work out alright for her. We hope so. Heh, yeah. That is amazing. You get to play bog in your case, What kind of a deal did your attorney make? Two years, nine months. And then he's pressing them to get me out. Yeah? Look. I have this list here. Things you would do, before you know, growing up. I was just starting to write it. I'm gonna be strong. Now, what would be number 1? Let's fool around, you don't wanna do this! Ok, look. 1 I said--- Marry me. Marry you? Well, I'm serious. Don't ever say that word around me, I tremble. There's a good reason for this. What kind of marriage would it be? It's like one nobody knows about. You go to a judge, you get a piece of paper, and then when you come to visit me, you present it to them. And I get to see you? Yeah. My lawyer told me about it. You go to a judge, you get a piece of paper. I do, I do too, OK, done! Conjugal visits. Nah, this law is crazy. It's true. What about dirt bikes? Tell me what you want in here. You. Do we have to think about this now? Yeah. Why? Let's complete this, and then We'll talk. A dirt bike? A trip upstate? A boat? No more boats. You know what you could do? You could tell your attorney you're going upstate. And we could like, fall asleep behind the wheel. End up in Vermont. Yeah, and then my parents will lose everything they own if I'd do that. You, you're breaking the rules right now by talking to me. Why don't you care. A fraction. I asked my lawyer if I could get you conjugal visits, and he said: "Get married! It's the only way." And I said: "No way! You're a miracle worker". There has gotta be a way. And he said, maybe that's his next project. He feels it's unconstitutional in the year 1992 that people have to be married to have conjugal visits. That, we're a liberated society, and we should be left alone. That would be his next project, going to the supreme court and saying that people should be able to have sex in jail, even if they're not married. I told him he should do it, but he said he needed a client. So I told him I'd be his client. And we still keep his name in the press. I want my name in the press. Why? Because I could make a lot of money. And I figure, if I have to go through all the pain and suffering, I'm getting a Ferrari. Pain and suffering? I don't want to go there. I know you don't. But I figure I'm being a good sport about it. Come on, let's do this, and then we'll hit the road. I'm giving you like, This is like someone saying he has choices with you. I know what I want. I wanna get married. Do you understand, Mam. You are pleading guilty to a felony. Yes. I will not accept your plea, Unless you are, in fact, guilty. Now, You'll have to tell me what you did, On may 19, 1992. I went to her doorstep with a loaded gun in my pocket. I proceeded to talk to Mrs. Buttafuoco for approximately 10 to 15 minutes. At which time, she turned around, to walk away. I hit her on the back of the head, and I went to hit her again, and the gun went off. I, I guess I obviously shot it. Was she injured. If you know... Yes. Then you left? She fell on top of me on the ground, and I tried to get her off of me. I hit her, I, I think twice, and I left. Then I ran away. Well, you knew when you went there, you were going to commit a reckless act, by assault with a firearm. Excuse me your honor, I didn't hear a question--- Did you know the gun was loaded, when you went there? Yes, your honor. Well, the court is satisfied that the defendant has acknowledged her guilt. And is willing to accept responsibility for it. Amy Fisher, do you now withdraw your: "not guilty" plea? And now enter a guilty plea, to assault in the first degree? Yes. How do you feel about the plea bargain? Amy, are you going out to celebrate? I'll buy myself a box of Kleenex. Mary Jo Buttafuoco has been kept informed for several weeks. I have hid nothing from her, or her attorney. Her main concern was that there would be no action against her husband. She does not believe he is involved in any crime. She even agreed to a shorter sentence, if he would not be subject to prosecution. Accidental assault. Does this look like an accident? Everything she has said is a lie. I can't believe that that DA gave up attempted murder, to go after my husband on statutory rape. Amy is an attempted murderer. A liar. And a prostitute. And the DA, accepts her statement, that she and Joe were together. I don't know what she's doing in that DAs office, but it's wrong! And I've had it. One more question--- Mary Jo! One at a time. You're disappointed there won't be a trial? I hate it. Three months in this story, and now we'll never know what happened. I think this plea bargain saved the taxpayers a lot of bucks. Yeah, but they're going after Joey now for statutory rape. Hey, there's money well spent. I wonder who the genius was behind that decision. Do you think he's guilty? Three sides to every story. His, hers. And the truth. Do you get to plea bargain your case? What kind of a deal did your attorney make? Three years and nine months, and then he's personally coming to get me out. Yeah? This is not the Amy Fisher the public would see in court the next day. Joining us in our New York studio is Raphael Abramovitz. Raph, what does this tape say about Amy Fisher's true character? It's an x-ray into her soul. He has a lot of power, and she hasn't learned anything. Marry me. Marry you? I'm serious. Don't ever say that word around me, I tremble. There's a good reason for this. What kind of marriage would it be? Like one nobody knows about. You go to a judge, you get a piece of paper, and then when you come to visit me, you present it to them. Then I get to see you? Yeah, my lawyer told me about it. He said: "You go to a judge, you get a piece of paper, I do, I do too". OK, done. Conjugal visits. That's crazy. It's true. I want my name in the press. Why? Because I could make a lot of money. And I figured, if I had to go through all the pain and suffering, I'm getting a Ferrari. Your pain and suffering? I don't wanna go there. Uh, I know you don't. This is a chilling example of the kind of human being that she is. I don't know how Amy gets away with this kind of thing, but she does. She's extremely powerful. Extremely powerful. Pegnozy. Who? Oh, hi! Um. Hi. I've been reading all of the stuff that you wrote about me. I wanted someone to know. I mean, after what has been on TV. You mean the... hard-copy tape? I have no friends. I have no one I can talk to, and I need someone I could talk to. That tape. That tape was edited and they twisted everything I said. They made me out to be this terrible, hard person who showed no remorse. And, they won't let me speak for myself. Who is stopping you from saying anything? The movie deal? I heard that you can't tell anyone your story. The thing is, is I feel very remorseful, and extremely frustrated because I can't tell everybody how sorry I am. Everybody is saying that all I got was a slap on the wrist, so. But five, even three years, seems like a lifetime to me. I mean, not that what I did wasn't wrong. But, before I met Joey, I was just a normal 11th grader. I didn't have any of these problems. Yo, well, that Meca guy doesn't really seem like a saint. He kind of sold you out, didn't he? I wasn't kidding when I asked Paul to marry me. I was really serious. I didn't want him to heart while I was gone. And I thought that if we got married, he'd feel better. Now I know I have no one. No one at all. That's enough, Amy. I just wanted you to know that the lawyer grabbed the phone from me. I wouldn't hang up, without saying goodbye. Yeah, bye. And thanks--- [Hangs Up] For everything. Rose! Rose, come here! It's call 391, maintenance call 391, please. She tried last night. They got her to vomit. Then they let her sleep it off. But when she tried a second time, today... I thought, we better bring her in. You know, what she swallowed, wouldn't have killed her. But, It's probably a good idea to pump her stomach, anyway. I mean, yeah. OK. Alright. It can only be hoped, that the events of Friday and Saturday, those alleged, suicide attempts, will insure that Amy will receive the all and continued care, She so obviously needs. Our obligation, has been, and remains, to cover the story as best we can. And to present the truth, as we find it. Since when? In light of that, we have another tape in our possession. It was sent, to Paul Makely from Amy in jail. I don't believe this, a TV is giving a press conference? I loved having you around, and I didn't want you to leave me. Besides, it's hard for me to talk about things, you know. I was trying to get rid of all of the bad things in my life, and this happened to me. I guess I just wanted a normal life. I wanted to go someplace where I wouldn't have to be afraid anymore. And Joe promised that he would never let anybody heart me. Never. And I think back to the last year of my life. Now, and I realize that Joe has heart me more than anyone has heart me in my life. That is, except for my Father. I just don't understand why my Mom ever had me. I mean, she let my Father do such terrible things to me. And I feel like she just looked the other way. She didn't do anything to stop it. This is the real Amy. Oh, I have a list from Eric Naiburg. Things I'm, not supposed to talk about. The shooting, and the prostitution. Joey, what can you talk about? When I was pregnant with her, She would kick so hard from the inside, I would have bruises in the outside. I... think she hated being trapped. She always hated being trapped. And, now I think What this Makely person did to her... What that show, showed. She felt trapped. Only, this time, the only person she could bruise, was herself. I think that's why she wanted to kill herself. It was her way out. After everything, you still love Amy? More than my own life. I wish you could know Amy better. Yeah, me too. Uh, maybe... you could come back and meet her? No tape recorded, just you. We could all go to the beach, you, me, and Amy. That's where we go if anything goes wrong. That might be a long time from now. She has to go to jail. You know, I'm proud of her. I'm proud of how she has come to grips with this. I'm proud of how she got through it. Proud? If I had done the things that Amy did, my mother would've put me through a wall! Well, She's not perfect. She's real. Rose, She's a convicted felon. Can't you at least can see that she's a monumental brat? Do you mean, is she spirited? I guess I just wanted a normal life. Normal life. A normal life. Mmm, that smells terrific. Mmm. Should I get the kids? That would be great. I love you baby. And I love you too. On October 22nd 1992, The Nassau County DA's office, announced that after an extensive investigation, There was insufficient evidence to connect Joey Buttafuoco with any of Amy Fisher's allegations, that they had had a sexual relationship. On December 1st 1992, Amy Fisher was sentenced to 5 go 15 years for assault in the first degree.
