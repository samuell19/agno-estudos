You're going to that prom if I have to sell my body to get you a date! Oh honey, you've got no sense of humor. I know, Mama. Did you know, I knew by the time she was two years old she had no sense of humor? And I know where she gets it. I swear Francie, you better shut up or that old Hank's gonna hear you. Well he's out with his cows, his beloved cows. Still. Okay, aww, is that not the sweetest thing you've ever seen. Honey I left a little bit of material up by the bust, just a little bit, you've finally got something up there. I just want you to flaunt it a little bit. Mama. What do you think? It's just a little bit. Honey, don't be such a prude. Well at least she ain't pregnant. Are you honey? Now if Hattie'd take Iris into her crowd, she'd have a date by tomorrow. I know, honey, but I can't control who that child likes any more than I can control the tides. Honey, you go ahead and try it on for me, all right? Ain't you running late for school? Yes, Daddy. All right, get going. Bring a chance of clothes with you, honey. Iris? I do not want her embarrassing herself in class, Hank. You're a horse's ass, Francine. He should know. He's seen enough of 'em. Oh, gal, you're too much. Well, if it ain't old Stinky Drawers. Oh man, now she don't smell too bad now that she got a pair of jugs the size of melons. Here we go, boys, here we go. Come on, what are you doing? Iris, what are you doing? Come on, Iris. Hey Iris. Ain't you gonna stop, Iris? Can I walk you to school? No, thank you. Oh come on, let me walk you. Come on, grab her tits, Mike. Let me hold your books. Oh, Iris, don't be so stingy. Come on, Mike, do it! If you let me carry your books, I might take you to prom. Leave me alone. Let me hold 'em, Iris. Come on. What are you waiting for, huh? Your wedding day? Then she'll be waiting a long time then. Give me! Stop, stop the truck! She's in the right position now, Mikey. Ah, Jesus H. Christ. Get back you inbred son-of-a-bitch! What the hell? Shit, that's blood. Mike, you okay? You crazy? What the hell did you do? You better get back into that beat up piece of shit you call a truck before I let loose, farm boy. Who the hell are you? None of your damn business. Well, this ain't none of your damn business. Come over here and stand behind me. Don't you move. If you touches you again, he's gonna be singing soprano in the church choir. Where you think you going, Iris? Mike, what the hell you doing? What're you doin' you chicken shit? Whyn't you come on out? Better get back over here right now, Stinky. Son of a bitch! You do that one more time you're gonna sorry. Sorry 'cause I forgot my manners or sorry 'cause you're about to do something? Mike, it ain't worth it. I said move it, move it, move it. Get in! I'll get you, bitch. Cow fuckers! Are you okay? We gotta turn those bastards in. Bastards! Hey, where you going? Wait up a minute, you're probably in shock or something. I can drive you if you want. Is it my mouth? I'm sorry, I've got a mouth like a gutter. I'm from the city. I can take care of myself. No need to thank me. Anytime. It's not like I risked my life or anything. Welcome to Oklahoma. Settle down, people. Young ladies, young gentlemen, homeroom is starting. Come on up, sweetie. Class, this is Margot Richmond. Maggie. Excuse me, dear? I'm called Maggie. Well, that's fine. Margot comes to us all the way from Kansas City. I expect all of you to welcome her to our humble farm town. If that's what they wear in the city, you can have it. She is pretty though. In a hard kind of way. And just why are we late, Miss Deerborne? Speak up, dear, I can't hear you. I went to the nurse's office. That's the third time this week. I don't suppose you brought a note. Never mind, just sit down. You have a seat too, Miss Richmond. Okay people, today we will be identifying different microorganisms on slides through our microscopes. And do not touch the Bunsen burners. Alice and Eddie, station one. Iris and Clarissa, station two. Can't we switch partners this week? I already told you no. I just don't understand why I keep getting stuck with Iris, just 'cause we're both Ds? We don't have time for your social preferences, Clarissa. Science doesn't care with whom you are partnered. So what'd he do? What? Your daddy? I mean, he must've done something to land you all in Wakita. Did he drink away the family fortune? Or was it gambling? Is that what your daddy did? Why are you laughing? Nothing. I was just... Nothing. My daddy invented terraced farming which just about saved Oklahoma from another dust bowl. He's the richest man in the tri-county. That's right. Wow, my daddy's never done anything as grand as that. He just takes pictures for Life Magazine. He does not. Well, if your daddy's some big photographer, then what are y'all doing in Wakita? Have you ever heard of Edward R. Murrow's "Harvest of Shame?" Yeah, of course. What is that? Rhonda. It's a documentary on the exploitation of migrant farm workers. I already knew that, Iris Deerborne, you didn't need to tell me. You seemed a little confused. Well, I wasn't. Anyways, Daddy's doing a follow-up. "The hardened heartland of America" sort of thing. Local color and all. So that's why we came here. Believe me, I despise moving to some podunk farm town and soon as I graduate, you'll see nothin' but my dust. I'm gonna be an airline hostess. They interviewed me back in Kansas City and since I'm already 18, they said I could just start right away. Then I'll just travel the world. I've been to Tulsa. Take my daddy, for instance, he flies all around the world. You might have even seen the picture he did for Marilyn. Like Marilyn Monroe? Well, who else? He mostly does political events. You know, wars, summit hearings, stuff like that, but every now and then Hollywood needs him to take some picture to capture some famous person's true essence. Celebrities are real picky about who shoots 'em. And Marilyn's very particular about her nose. You should be a songbird. Definitely, she'd fit right in with the girls. Mrs. Hubbard loves us. We can get you in, no problem. Maybe. Do you know what we're doing? Hello? I'll be right back. Hi, I'm Grace Richmond. I have a two o'clock appointment. Come on in. You have simply got to go to the Disciples of Christ. You will love Reverend Steve. We just love Reverend Steve. He has the most scandalous cleft chin. Like one of them models on the cover of those Harlequin Romances. You are a Christian? Of course. And I'm sure joining the church will help us get to know your wonderful community. My daughter, Maggie, had her first day at Wakita High. Oh, my Hattie goes there. Oh, and my Clarissa too. They will love her if she is anything like you. Miss Atkins, I think I've got that fence shored up real good for you now. You'd like to come take a look at it? Oh, I'm sure everything looks great, Mr. McCoy. She don't have to check your work every step of the way, Len. I just like my customers to approve of my work, dear. Well, she oughta be since you've been working on her fence for going on damn-near six whole days now while Jerry Unger's been waitin' on the barn loft all this while! I'll get to it, okay? I'm sure everything looks great. Let me just get you your money. You are working my last nerve. You hear me? This looks delicious, sweetheart. Quit it, Tallulah. Don't do that. Shh shh shh. Girls, I don't know how many times I have to tell you to put your napkin in your lap please. And Maggie, could you please be a good role model for your sisters? Emily. So, I went by the local beauty salon today. Met a woman named Barbara Dell. Her daughter Clarissa is in Maggie's homeroom. Oh, is that right? And apparently Clarissa's quite popular. She can help Maggie meet some new friends. Some really nice girls. Yeah, I've met some of them and they'll kill you with kindness. Stop it, ow. What, it could be nice to meet some new friends, some good girls. Make the best of the situation. Girls, please. Just hope they like me. Oh honey, they have no reason not to. All right, well, let's pray and eat this delicious meal that your mother's prepared. Dear Heavenly Father, we thank You for this day. We thank You for this food and for the preparation of it. And I ask that You continue to give us strength to love others around us. Thank you for this house and the many blessings that You have given us. We do not deserve them, God. Who cares, you are. I was gonna bring 'em out to your house. Oh, she'll see, if an attractive girl like you came to my house, my wife Pat will be very jealous. Oh, say that again. My wife Pat will be very... No, the first part. An attractive girl like you. Oh. An attractive, adorable girl like you. Now that's a real man. Those European types, they know a thing or two. Those European types stay off of farms. That's for sure. They steer clear of steer. They steer clear of steer. Hey, I'm talking to you. Leave it be, Francie. Leave it be, Francie. That's enough for you. Might be enough for you, but it sure as shinola ain't enough for me. Goddammit, Francie, I told you that's enough. Oh, look who got up out of his chair. Let me have that. - Mr. Invisible. - No, let me have that. Don't you tell me what to do. Now I'm not gonna tell you what... If I need to grab that out of you, I will. Don't you take it. Hank, I swear to God, don't take it! I wish I may, I wish I might, have the wish I wish tonight. Let me disappear. Let me disappear. Who is it? Who's there? It's Maggie. Maggie? Maggie Richmond. What are you doing here? Swimmin'? But you can't, this is private. It's a private place. Oh, I didn't know. Well, if it's so private, what are you doing here? This is my place. Oh. Do you mind sharin' it for a little while? Are you naked? You can't be naked in here. What if somebody comes and sees you? Thought you said this was a private place. Who's gonna see me? You better be careful. Why? There's a dead body in here. Charlotte Owings, she drowned here. Suicide, she just walked right in until the water covered her head, and that's why nobody comes here anymore. You come here. Why'd she kill herself? People said she was the town punch. The town punch? That she was with other men that weren't her husband. But that's, that's just what they say. I don't know, I think she was just sad. Maybe I should kill myself then. Lie down at the bottom there with Charlotte Owens. It's not funny. She was really sad, she wasn't like you. What do you know about me? What? Someone's got my foot. - No, they do not. - No, I'm serious, Iris. Someone's got my foot. Maggie! Maggie? Maggie, where'd you go? Maggie, there's roots under here, you could get stuck. That's not funny. Maggie? That wasn't funny. You should have seen your face, it was hilarious. You're no better than the rest of 'em. Think you're big by stepping on somebody else is disgusting. Wait, Iris I was kidding. Please, don't go. Please, we can share it. Please. And then they wanted me to be a model, but my dad didn't want me to get spoiled. You know he's worked with all those famous actresses, and sees how spoiled they get, but I did take a few modeling classes. Do you wanna know how to sell lips? Sell lips? Yeah, you know if you're a model for lipstick, you have to know how to sell lips. It's like this. That looks awful. What do you mean? That's how you do it. You try. You're a liar. What? You lie. You did it today in chemistry, your daddy doesn't work for Life magazine. Yes he does. You didn't take no modeling classes, neither. I did too. What do you know about me? Nothin'. I don't know, maybe you just want people to like you. Why do you think that? You wish people would like you? I don't care if people like me. You don't know me. You don't know anything about me. Except, you know what? You're right. I am a liar. I don't want to share this place with you. You can have it. Who were you with? No one. Maggie? Grace, get back inside. Honey, it's late. Wouldn't it be best if we all came in? Grace, get back inside. Alright. I'm gonna ask you one more time. Who were you with? I was swimming alone. I left my job for you. I moved my family. You already told me that. Next time we're gonna go without you. Do you understand me? I told you it won't happen again. Get inside and dry off. Now. What's that bruise? How come they call you "Stinky Drawers"? She might be from the city, but the girl needs schooling. I swear, this damn bra. It's a blessing and a curse, ain't it? Forget it. Maggie? Now don't worry if you can't do the splits in the tryouts, okay? They won't hold it against you as long as you have flexibility in other areas. Like, there's flexibility besides the splits. And you oughta know, Hattie. Now you don't have to be a bitch, Clarissa. You have to come to the after-game dance tomorrow night. Oh yeah, it's a good time to nail down a prom date. Let me tell you, pickin's are gettin' mighty slim. Todd Ingram and Jerry Junior are already off the market. Already? Yes, there's an air of hysteria building. I'm not worried but, Maggie, this is a crucial time for you. We can't afford to be lazy. - You could get left at home. - You wouldn't want that. Certainly not. And Maggie, we know you're new and all. There's no real way you could know. But it is essential you stay away from Iris Deerborne. She's an untouchable. An untouchable? Like India? They're the lower class. They bathe in their own body waste. Oh Rhonda, please not before lunch. That's disgusting. I'm sure you'll still be able to eat. Clarissa Dell, I will have you know I've lost 5 pounds this month. Yeah, you look swell. But if you're not careful you'll have it back on by Tuesday. Songbirds have to set an example, Hattie. Remember we talked about self-control? Oh my lord. The point is, being seen with Iris Deerborne is social suicide. As opposed to suicide, which wouldn't be as embarrassing? Never mind. How's my form? It needs work. Do you think your daddy would photograph any of the games if you made the squad? If I made the squad. Okay! This thing seat two? Uh, not easy. I never said I was easy, young man. Mrs. Deerborne, you know I didn't mean it like that. I know what you meant. How 'bout we go for a quick spin anyways. I really should be gettin' home. My grandma's waitin' on me. Okay, well let's just make it a quick spin. The wind's already messed up my hair. I don't know if Mr. Deerborne would approve of that. Hank? Hank's out in the back forty moonin' on his cows. C'mon. I paid for this thing. Might as well get a ride out of it. Let's go. Mrs. Deerborne, I really should go. I'm sorry. No you don't. No you don't gotta go. Now just stop right there and just give me a ride. No. Just 'cause your mama went and drowned herself don't mean you gotta be scared of every woman you know. No. Oh honey, I'm sorry. Oh! Oh I'm so sorry. Goddammit Iris. She just sees a good-lookin' boy, and she just falls to pieces. Let the dog get it. I'll take it out of your allowance. Take the egg money out of my wages. Iris? You awake? Baby, you awake? What, Mama? Baby? I want you to try this dress on, okay? - Mama, no. - Let me tell you something, This is your boy catcher. You just don't know how to catch a boy. That is all. And I'm gonna help you, okay? - Now get up. - Mama, please. Get up baby, now c'mon c'mon c'mon. Get up. Get up. I'm tellin' you, I am sick and tired of people in this town talkin' down to you. I'm just sick and tired of it. No, Mama, don't, Mama. I'm gonna help you. When I was your age, I could get any boy I wanted. I had to beat 'em off with a stick. If I hadn't gotten pregnant, who knows where I might be? Mama, I wanna go to sleep. C'mon sweetheart, let's get up. And I am not gonna let you use up your chance. No ma'am. No ma'am. You are not. Let's take a look at you now. Baby, you look so pretty. You look so pretty. Oh, c'mon baby, let's go. Let's get out of her room, honey. I'm not trying to make a problem, baby. - I know, c'mon. - I'm not trying to make a problem. Come here, come here. C'mon. Let's go. I'm sorry, baby. Are you okay? Don't come near me. I just wanna make sure you're okay, and then I'll go. No, please get away. It's okay. Get back! It's okay. I wet myself. What? I wet myself. Oh. My dad works for Agricultural Quarterly. He doesn't work for Life magazine. He doesn't take pictures of Marilyn Monroe. He takes pictures of drainage pipes and cow shit. I also could never be a model. I'm way too flat-chested. They also never interviewed me to be an airline hostess. I could never be an airline hostess. Why not? I get airsick. The last time I was on an airplane, I threw up my Ovaltine all over the aisles. and the airline hostess made me clean it up. They're all first-class bitches. They call me "Stinky Drawers" 'cause I've got a weak bladder. And I hate this dress. I hate this dress! Here you go. Thank you. You've got a great arm. But you just need to work on your aim a little bit. I learned this really great trick from my favorite southpaw, Bud Daley. So, if you point your free hand where you want the rock to go, and then with your hand that has the rock, you just chuck it. You try. And Deerborne takes the mound. This rookie's ready to throw some heat. Here comes the windup. And it's clocked at 90 miles per hour, it's a strikeout! Oh my gosh! It worked! I told you it works. Bud Daley never fails. Ah! What'd I tell you? Oh my gosh! Not so bad. Not so bad. You don't have to talk to me at school. It's 'cause of my parents, the cheerleading and stuff. I understand. They hate me. Who? My parents. Sometimes I wonder if they even see me. Or they're lookin' at what they wish I was. How could they not see you? Let me pull you. Go see who's honkin'. It's Maggie. Who's Maggie? My friend. Thanks for picking me up for school. Oh, you shouldn't thank me, 'cause we're ditching. Maggie? Yeah? I think I'm too big for your mom's stuff. That's how it's supposed to look, Iris. Is your bust popping out? A little. Then it's right. Oh. I'm legally blind. Well then you won't get arrested. Just a little dab. Beautiful. And this shadow, Dusky Mauve, is complimentary if you purchase the Sun Kissed body makeup. And now, for the finishing touch. This is Captive Rouge. I imagine wearing this while on a deserted island with Bobby Darin. This is the perfect moment to sell lips. Did you see the way he came barreling in and shooting that gun? That was the craziest thing I've ever seen. I've never seen anyone shoot a gun that fast. Steve McQueen was, he was nice. What? He was what? He was nice. Now I can't see anything. We should get you new glasses. My mom will never go for that. She always says, don't fix it if it ain't broke. Iris, it's broke. Would you look at that? It's beautiful. It's meant for you. You should try it on. I'd just ruin it. That's why mama never buys me anything nice. Let's go. Not yet. Iris. Dr. Kay? Yes dear? Do you have Iris Deerborne's results? I do. Well I'm her sister, Margot. Could you tell me what's wrong with her? Hank Deerborne's only got one child so far as I know. Well I'm, I'm her friend. As I told her mother many times before, I didn't find anything wrong with Iris. Well then how come she, how come she keeps wetting herself? It's all up here. Psychosomatic. Dr. Kay? Maybe this time there is something wrong with her. That's Clarissa Dell's car. Oh. We can come back another time. Okay. Maggie, no. Hi. Iris Deerborne, is that you? Hi Hazel. I've never seen you all dolled up. I hardly recognized ya. What can I do for you? More like a mud frog in a sweater set. What'd she say? Actually, you seem busy. No, not at all, not at all. Clarissa and Rhonda are just drying and Hattie needs to soak. I've been soaking for 30 minutes. You have rough calluses, dear. Come on over. We need to get Iris ready for the after-game dance. We do? What's a dance without its wallflower? You know, I don't think I put enough permanent solution in your hair. I'll be right with you as soon as I figure out what to do with all of Iris' natural curl. I told you she was an untouchable. Shoot, well I guess I'd better warn my dad. Why? I know it sounds crazy, but he's photographing her for the magazine. For Life Magazine? Mmhmm. Somehow he got this idea in his head that he needs to find the heart of the Heartland for his next piece so he thinks Iris is deep, as deep and far reaching as the plains of Oklahoma. You look a picture. Let's get started. Is that me? That's you, hon. I hardly recognize myself. Clarissa Dell, eat your heart out. I have a feeling she will. What about you? Me? What can we do with that gorgeous mane? God. It's a mess. What a beautiful color you have. Thank you. Is this your husband? How did he die? If it's not too rude of me to ask. No, it's not rude at all, hon. He died in the Korean War. Oh, I'm so sorry. Me too. Um, you know what? Um, I actually don't even know what I'm wearing, but thank you though. Oh the outfit does pick the hair style. Mmhmm, Iris, let's go. All right. Thanks, Hazel. It was my pleasure. You all have fun. Who is this angel before me? What did you do to yourself? Maggie gave me a beauty makeover. And I'd say she did a mighty fine job. Where'd you get the money for it? We don't have that kind of money just lying around the house. It's all right if she uses a little of her own allowance on herself. Where are you glasses? I took 'em off, but it's just for tonight. I wanna go to the after-game dance. You can't go outside without your glasses. You can't see a foot in front of you. I'll be careful... Francie, lay off. Don't tell me how to mind my child. Edith says this Maggie's mom drives around in a spanking new car. She gets her clothes from Dior. So what are you gonna do when this Maggie says she don't like the way Iris smells? Francie, leave it be. Now I mean it. That is just like the two of you, just ganging up on me. Honey, you go on and go to that dance now, all right? You go on and you enjoy yourself. You look beautiful. Thank you. Hey, well hurry up and get ready. You're gonna be late. I'm not going. What do you mean you're not going? It doesn't matter if I change my hair or I have different clothes or a different face, I'm still me. I'm still the same girl I always was. Iris... No, you shouldn't miss it. You should go. I'm gonna be with you the whole time and anyone who doesn't like it can go straight to hell. I can't. Night, Maggie. I don't care about your help. Well, Mads says that we are beautiful young ladies. You do pay her for a reason. Clarissa. There she is. Calm down, Hattie, she's not Christ risen. You made the team! You're an official songbird. Which makes you one of us. Great. What happened to your hair? Never mind that. Okay, our first official order of business for our new songbird is to find her a prom date. Oh! Brian Emerich asked me. The midget. He is not. He comes up to her bust. That's only if I'm wearing heels. Don't be so sensitive, Hattie. Anyway, we all have football players, but I think there's one left for you. Over there. But we have to wait 10 minutes before we approach. Clarissa says, it's never good to look too eager. I do say that. Well, I wouldn't want to look too eager. What are these? I found them in your coat pocket. Pills for my bladder. Maggie took me to Dr. Kay. Maggie? Maggie, Maggie, Maggie. She's my friend, mama. Some friend. You know what these are? They're pills for my bladder. They're sugar pills. That's all they are. Sugar. Mama, give me my pills. Honey, you think this girl is your friend, I'm the one that knows better. I'm the one that takes care of you and I can tell you, I would never ever give you sugar pills. Stop it. No, you do not need these. You do not need these, these are no good for you. You keep taking these and you will still wet yourself and that girl, Maggie will be having one big old laugh. Mama, I haven't wet myself. I'm dry. Well alright then. You go on to that dance and you have fun. Oh don't forget your candy. Craig Butler, this is Maggie Richmond. She's just as pretty as y'all said she is. She's right here. Oh she's feisty too. I like that. Don't touch. If you two go together, then we can take yearbook photos together. Maybe Maggie's daddy can take it. Oh, he's pretty busy. Well you can at least ask. So where are you boys taking us for dinner? Oh, we were thinking Beef and Chips. Well that's disgusting, Craig Butler. Excuse me. Who is that? I don't know. Maybe she's new? That's Iris Deerborne. No it's not. Yes it is, can't you smell her? You came. I came. I love that you came. Once a pig, always a pig. Hmm. Definitely. We've got to cure Maggie of her Pygmalion complex. Pygmalion. Pig, we read it Sophomore Lit. God, Rhonda, you're so dense. Please don't stay here on my account. Go have fun. I am having fun. - I should go home. - Don't you dare. Hey, Iris. That gorgeous boy just said hey to you. I know. Why don't you say hey back? I can't. Why not? Because I might throw up. Oh. You know what? I think I will go have some fun. Wait, Maggie. No, wait. Maggie? Did you have to pay? What? Those eggs that we broke. Did you have to pay for them? No. Oh, good. Otherwise, I was going to have to pay you back. Well, you don't, so. You look different without your glasses. I'm just going to have to put them right back on. I can't see a thing. No, no, you look good with them on. But... I don't know. I guess without them you just, I don't know, you look all grown-up or something. Oh. Do you wanna dance? What? Do you wanna dance with me? No. Oh. I can't dance. Neither can I. Then why do you wanna dance with me? Because Iris, you're the only girl in this town who's not phony. Come on, please? Hey. Jeff Owings is dancing with Iris Deerborne. Shut your mouth! Maybe she is deep? Hey, Iris. Hello? Today we are creating magnesium oxide in our labs. Alice and Eddie, station one. Clarissa and Johnna, station two. I don't see why we gotta change partners just 'cause we have someone new. Well, that's not very friendly, Clarissa. Just who is Johnna supposed to work with? How should I know? Just when I get used to Iris you gotta change everything. Kim and Jack, station three. Charlie and Scott, station four. Katherine and Mona, station five. Tripp and Richard, station six. You seen Clarissa? No. She said she might ditch third and go to the drive-up. Over here! Oh, my God. It's hot. Why did y'all have to sit in the sun for? So we can get a tan before prom. Right, Iris? Did anybody ask you yet? We saw you with Jeff Owings the other night dancing. No Well, he hasn't asked anybody else. Susan Laharty is beside herself. She thought for sure they'd get back together by prom. She can forget it. He doesn't even go to prom. He's one of them lone wolf types, you know. That may be but I'll have Clarissa put in a good word with him. Uh, thanks. I don't want that. What's in here, though? Iris, you wanna ride? Oh, come on. You can't tell me you didn't love it. I didn't love it. They're gonna find out your daddy doesn't work for Life Magazine any second. If that's all they find out then I'm gonna be lucky. Besides, his magazine's owned by Life. You can't keep lying like that. I swear I will never lie to you. But it was so worth it watching their dumb faces squirm when I told them my dad thought you were deep. Hey! What are you doing? You shouldn't be naked. What if someone comes and sees you? I thought you said this place was private. Who's gonna come? - You did it! - I did! Tallulah, don't forget to drink your juice, please. Well, I understand a certain young lady got asked to the prom. Oooo. Did I hear that right? Candy Butler phoned me this morning to tell me that her son Craig asked you. Oh. Girls. Shh, shh, shh. Candy says Craig's a football player. Isn't that nice? He plays football. Sure. Well, I thought it would be a good idea if you skip school and went to look for a dress with your mother. How about that? You know I really can't. I've got a test in Classics today. Oh, I think it's a pretty good idea to go look for a dress with your mother. I think it's a nice thing for a mother and a daughter to do together. Don't you think? Okay. Well, good. Good. Well, then I'll just go get ready. I don't want you to worry about money. I want you to get what you want. No expense spared. All right? Thanks, Dad. Hello? Um. I wasn't expecting anyone. Uh, what can I do for ya? Got a date to the prom. You and half the rest of the town. I'm booked the next two weeks solid. You know, cuts and perms and latest hairstyles, so. Okay. Well um, thanks anyway. I mean, I can show you how to style it if you want. Yeah. That'd be that'd be great. Um, I just got this dress today and my mom wanted me to see what hairstyle would go with it. Well, let's see the dress. Was that your choice? What do you think? I think, no. Right. Well, you didn't get to pick the dress so you're gonna have to pick the hairstyle. Can I put it right there? Sure can. You seem to be adjusting to Wakita pretty fast. Yeah, it's okay. Do you like it here? I wouldn't have chosen it but my great-aunt left me the house after she died. And I needed a fresh start, so here I am. Now um, you know, we could give you a we could give you a chignon. Give you that Roman Holiday look. That kind of gives me a headache. Goes with the dress. I mean, we could do Dorothy from Wizard of Oz. Or Annette Funicello. All I need is a bullet bra and something to fill it with. I mean, I like you like this. Unadorned, you know? Just you. I don't think you need a style, sweetie. But if you want I can fit you in for a set and dry day of. Okay. What time is the dance? Uh, 6:00. How about two o'clock? That'd be great. Two o'clock it is. Do you miss him? Yes, I do. He was a good boy. Do you think you'll ever marry again? I... I was never married. I just told people that when I moved here. You know people in a small town, they don't wanna know. Well, they don't need to know everything. So he was your lover? No, that would be scandalous. No. No, that's my brother, Eddie. He was 19 when he went to Korea. He was so skinny that his uniform hung off him like a gunny sack on a broomstick. He had pimples all over his forehead. He thought he'd never get a girl. He was so desperate to get a girl. That's the sad part for me that um that he never outgrew that. That notion of being a flawed person. So I'll um, I'll see you on the 15th. Okay. Great. - All right. - Bye, thank you. Hey! I don't recall saying yes. Better go talk to her, Craig. Can I help you with somethin'? I don't think it's very nice that you're telling everyone around town you're taking a gal to a dance when she never did say yes. Don't you think I have the right to make up my own mind? I figured I knew what was good for ya. You think so? Know so. Prove it. Oh man! You just going to leave us like that? Craig! She got a sister? What are we doing here? What, are you chicken? I do not need to see a ghost come up out of that water. Oh, a big ol' strong man like you ain't afraid of nothing! Damn, you city girls is fast. And you country boys is slow. We can be if you want us to be. I like it fast, then slow. Damn. You forget to be afraid. I'm afraid of you. What are you doing? Let me in before I break my goddamn neck for Christ sake. Geez Louise, goodness gracious. Shh, shh, you have to be quiet 'cause if my mom hears you there will be hell to pay. Ugh, there's always hell to pay. You're drunk. I am? You smell like... What is that? Um, lighter fluid? I think? Let me go get you some water. No, no, no, don't get any water, I'll just get drunker, I don't need any. Where you been? I've been to Hell. I saw the Devil and he said, "Maggie Richmond, "you don't fool me." Shh, shh, shh. Fool me. Hey, Iris it's just that it don't matter if I change my hair, or have different clothes. I'm still me, I'm still the same person. I always was. I don't know what you're talking about, Maggie. It don't matter if my daddy moves me from the city with all of those bad influences, and no matter I'm sick in the soul and I need savin'. Oh, Maggie. Don't matter if I lose my virginity to Craig Butler in the Sumner Pond. Maggie. Let him put himself inside of me. Hey, hey, hey. It's okay. I'm, I'm dirty, and I can't get it out of me! You're not dirty, Maggie. Don't cry, it's all going to be okay. You're the only one that gets me. You're the only one that understands me. I promise, you're okay. The only one that gets me. Hey, you're going to be. Maggie. I didn't mean to do that to you. Maggie, Maggie, Maggie. I'm sorry, nothin' happened. It's okay. Nothin' happened. I don't think of you that way. That's not how I think of you. I know you don't! It's never been like that with you, I'm sorry. Maggie, no! Maggie, don't go! Maggie! Maggie, please don't go! Maggie! Hi. Hi. Is your dad around? I kinda need to talk to him before school. He's in the barn, tractor's down again. Well you're a sight for sore eyes. Good morning, Mrs. Deerborne. Oh, call me Francie, make me feel like I'm 100 years old calling me Mrs. Deerborne. Iris, you best get on to school before you're late. I'm waiting for my ride. It don't look like she's coming. Maybe she's moved on to greener pastures. Happens. Actually I'm her ride today, if she wants. It's okay, but she don't need your pity. She doesn't need my pity, she just needs a ride. You need a ride back home? Why? I saw you, during that real hot stretch last August, at Sumner Pond. It was my mom's birthday. I just wanted to go someplace where I maybe could you know, feel close to her. Talk to her maybe. Then I saw you there, you were sitting there on the shore, looking up at the sky. You must've been thinking about something real serious. I don't know, you looked so different alone. You seemed so... at peace. I thought, I don't know maybe, she could be at peace too. Iris! There you are. Hi, Hattie. Hi, Jeff. Guess what? I guess I'll see you. Guess what? What? Craig gave Maggie a ring! They're getting married? No silly, a promise ring! A promise to what? Oh Iris Deerborne, I swear you're so deep, how come you don't know what a promise ring is? Good heavens! Come on. He did what? Craig somehow managed to bootleg a bottle of Dom. Dom? Perignon. It's champagne. Ta-da! It was his grandmothers. Looks new. Well I shined it up with some toothpaste, but it's a bonafide antique. I like aged things. I swear this is the last greasy burger I'm having for the next two weeks, or I'm going to be blemished for prom. Yeah, I think I'm going to skip lunch. You have to skip it up to fit in your dress. Why do you gals always pick on me? Hattie! No honestly, I don't know why I put up with it? I'll just go get the food. Can you let me out? Somethings wrong, I know it. Just leave it. I can always tell when you're lying. I'm not lying. I don't believe you. Last night... I was drunk last night. I barely remember anything. You swore you'd never lie to me, and you're doing it right now. Meet me at the pond tonight. I can't. Yes you can. Meet me. I changed my mind. I don't need to get fries. Maggie, what are you doing? We're having a party, that's what. Maggie, I don't see why we have to come here. This place gives me the creeps. Well that's because our parents won't come looking for us here. Absolutely not. What are you doing? Maggie, why are they here? This is our own place! Don't be so stingy. Craig Butler, you better keep your trousers on. What'd you think it's gonna jump out at you? Ahhhhhh! You better put that away, Craig Butler! That's for my eyes only! Get them out of here. I am not disrobing if that's what you think. We've all seen it about a hundred times, Hattie, I don't know what the problem is? Oh, fine. Maggie, make them go, please. Stop! Come on in, Maggie! Oh my God! Stop it! - What are you doing? Get out! - Whoa, whoa, you crazy? Stop it! Get out! Get up, get up, get out! Don't! Stop it! Calm down. Get out! She's gone crazy! Get out of my pond! Iris! Iris, stop! Iris, calm down! Stop! What's wrong? You're not like them, you're nothing like them! You lie to them, not me, you lie them. What is she talking about? Have you lied to me? I don't know what she's saying. Maggie, Maggie, please help me. Come on, what's wrong with you? What is wrong with you? You're what's wrong with me! Maggie! You're what's wrong with me. Stinky drawers. You're lying. Don't. I know you. Maggie, come on in, the water's nice. We didn't want her anyway. She'd just stink up the place! Don't worry about her. Mags, where are you going? You shouldn't be here. I just don't get why Clarissa gets to decide everything. I thought you liked Cattleman's? That's not the point. She just, she decided where we're eating prom night with out asking me or my date. I just don't think I'm going to put up with it anymore. What are you going to do about it? Tell her off? I might! I'd like to see that. What, you think I wouldn't? No! I don't know. Its just, I'd like to see it that's all. Where are we going? I'm supposed to pick up some henna for my mom. It's after midnight. Hazel said she'd leave it on the front porch. It's alright. I'll be right back. She done slam that door, mmm that girl. What the Sam Hill are you doing! It's late! You'll wake her up! Maybe she left it on the back stoop? Can we not do this in the morning, I'm zonked! Keep your shirt on, I'll just be a minute! Hattie! Maggie and Hazel. Maggie and Hazel! Maggie and Hazel! Hattie, I can't make hide or hair what you're saying. Maggie and Hazel. What, baby? I saw them together. What? Together? I saw them together. Baby baby, shh! It's alright baby. It's alright, it's alright. Shh! Mommy's here. I guess men like me ain't good enough for you, are we, bitch? You brought all this on yourself, honey! You know that? Now you can go back to your sorry life! We can go back to that doctor in Kansas city. He said he could help them they help so many kids like that, help them be normal. Sorry You were You were my beautiful little baby, my little girl. And you always woke up smiling to see us and so happy. I'm sorry. We did something wrong. I did something wrong. You were an angel. I'm gonna make it better. I'm gonna fix this. Jesus. Jesus. I promise. You don't have to worry about me anymore. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Maggie! Maggie! Maggie! Mrs. Deerborne, it was just so terrible. Oh, I knew it. I knew there was something not right with that girl, I knew it. What's happened, mama? You. I don't even wanna talk to you. What are you talking about? Hattie found that Maggie Richmond and Hazel together. Hazel cuts Maggie's hair. Not like that, you dimwit, together. My poor baby is traumatized for life. It's all over town. Boys done went over to Hazel's and run her off. Where's Maggie? Ow! Don't you touch my daughter. Where is she? Some of the kids saw her go into to Sumner Pond. She just walked right in 'til the water covered her head, just like Charlotte Owings. Iris! It's okay. You're Iris? Yes. Her mother told me you were her friend. I am her friend. Have you seen her? Not since yesterday, no. I've been looking all over town. If you see her, tell her to come home. Tell her it doesn't matter, tell her I don't care anymore. We don't care if she was bad. Mr. Richmond, she was never bad. We got something! Oh, let her disappear. Let her disappear, let her disappear. What is it? I don't know! Neale, you got your eyes on this? Is that? That looks like my... It's a dress! Do you know how much time and labor I put into that dress? I do not think this is funny. I know mama. I never did have a sense of humor. None whatsoever. Hey, come on now! Hey! Stinky drawers! Never knew you liked girls! Come on Iris, where you going? Come on back. Hey, what are you doing? Stop it, stop it! You hit this truck. I swear, stop that! Shit! Alright come on! Get the hell outta here, man! Don't you ever touch me again! You bastards! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! Crazy dyke! Cow fuckers! Okay I'm gonna have to watch your sticky little fingers. Did I tell you Hattie said, when she saw them? Totally naked. Totally? Nothing, nothing on. Yep, and they still haven't found that girl's body. I bet you she's down there with Charlotte, trapped in one of them underground caves forever. I don't think a girl who can throw rocks like Maggie Richmond's gonna let herself die of shame. I bet you she got on the night bus out of Wakita and she snubbed her nose at all the petty, small-minded people who couldn't see her shine. Where you going dressed like that? Maybe she's going to the prom after all. I wouldn't go to that prom to save my life. I've got a date. With who? A boy. Since when do you have a boy? I'm never gonna be as beautiful as you are, mama, but I've got a date with a boy tonight. I do love you, mama. Well, quit staring at me and play your goddamn cards. You're late. Sorry, I had to pick something up for you. Oh, it's beautiful. Here. Is this alright? Yes.
