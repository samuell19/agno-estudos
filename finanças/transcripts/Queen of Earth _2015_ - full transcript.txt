Why are you doing this to me? I can't explain it. You can't explain it. You can't explain it. You can explain it. You will explain it. No. I can't. Really. How could you do this so soon after the accident? It wasn't an accident, Catherine. It was on purpose. And besides, this over reliance has been suffocating. How soon after did you start seeing her? That's a ridiculous question. Well, answer it. Before. Before. Before? Can we... can we please just relax? - No, we can't please just. - I'm pleading with you here. Well, you don't get any pleas, you piece of shit. 'Cause I hate you. So this shouldn't be too painful. No. It shouldn't. It shouldn't be too painful. Because it's just one more thing on top of everything else. Just one more thing. You're being dramatic. My father was my life, and my family was my life. And then you were a part of both. And now, now I hate you. Now I hate you, you dishonest snake. I'm not looking for you to understand me here. Well, good. Because there's no chance of that happening! I just think that you've been misdirecting a lot of anger towards me The past few months and I can't take it anymore. Oh! Oh, good for you. I'm glad that's... I'm glad that you figured that out. Good. You feel better? Good. Don't you think we've got to the place Where we rely on each other too much for it to be healthy? Do not try to... to justify this as some sort of effort To help me or save me like you're doing me a fuckin' favor. Like I should thank you. That's not untrue. No, it's not untrue. Just go. Just go. Just go. I don't want you to see me like this. Go. Please, just leave me alone. Please, just leave me alone. Please. Go! Why are you walking? I didn't feel like waiting. It's like 2 miles to the house. Okay. Catherine. Hey. Thanks for the exile. That's what this place is here for. What's happening with the apartment? Oh, he's moving out while I'm here. So... that is it. Looks great. - Your regular room awaits. - Oh. Everything feels so close to me. Like the good and the bad. Things aren't so bad right now though. No. You're absolutely right, Virginia. They're worse. They're much, much worse. Well, there's nothing you can do about that now, so... You might as well... He must have really suffered. You know, my father. He was afflicted. People say that depression is a sickness But I never thought of it that way. I always just thought of it as one of his problems... Just like work or money are problems, you know. Now that he's gone, it's all I can think about. Oh, fucker. Unh. Dammit! - Por vous. - Thank you. Goddammit, you're gonna make me throw up. Can't a guy fix a cup of java for his special lady? Yuck. What would happen if you broke up? Then she'd have to fix her own coffee. I'm not joking. You seem cripplingly codependent. No, we don't. We? You just said... Why did you say "we?" I'm talking about you. There's no "we" in this scenario. You sound like Smeagol. Ginny. Why so negative? Only my closest friends call me Ginny. Virginia, why so negative? I don't know, James. - Hey, you said, remember? - I remember, yeah. We're gonna have a nice morning. You can't force someone to have a nice morning. - Well, sure you can. - Yes, you can. I wasn't speaking to you. Well, now you're speaking to me. - Hey. - Hey. I thought you were asleep. I went out. - I couldn't sleep. - It's so quiet here. Exactly. That looks good. - I'm rusty. - What? I said, "I'm rusty." Oh. I thought you said something else. Where did you get these? I went to the store. So what, did you think I brought all of that with me? The store is like 4 miles. Well, I just started walking and then I was there. Please don't say that. Because I won't stand to be treated by you That way anymore, that's why. I don't care about that! And that is insulting to the both of us. I have to go, she's watching. Don't ask. Was that James? Does "don't ask" mean something different where you're from? We're from the same place. I'd really rather not. I wasn't sure if you were still in here. Where else would I be? You wanna go for a walk or something? It's nice out. My face hurts. How do you mean? Can you please not make me talk right now? I'm sorry. What are you doing in here? What do you mean? What are you doing? Like, actually. It's all dark in here. I'm hiding. From what? It drives me crazy that places like this Are so close to the city. Places like this? Yeah, you know, where tranquility isn't just a myth. You can come here any time my family isn't using it. Any time, Ginny? Labor Day, Memorial Day, Fourth of July? I told you not to call me Ginny. He's joking. Well, some jokes make me feel uncomfortable. - This is my fault? - No, not really. Can we not do this, please? I thought we came here to relax, or at least I did. I don't know about what you two are doing. Well, relaxing or having a vacation Would imply that at some point it might end. So you can't really get away from it all If that's all you are doing, you know. Then you're just a bum. Are you a bum, Ginny? What a stupid, shitty thing to say. I don't care at all about going back. And in fact, now that I think about it, I'd just as soon not. Right. B-U-M, bum. Just mind your own business, Your Majesty. Okay, um... Where are you going? I'm just gonna, uh... Give you two a little space. Not necessary. We're fine. I'm still going to just excuse myself. - Please don't. - Yeah, please don't. Thank you. That was very mature. What's it like having all the answers All the time to everything? It must be such a luxury. It is. Immeasurably. Please don't do this. I mean, it's not the end of the world But could you at least acknowledge That you never stopped to think about What I might have wanted from this trip? Are you calling me a lousy friend? Are you saying you're a lousy friend? I don't know what you want me to say. I love you more than anything, you stupid brat. Well, we should trade places. See how we feel then. Oh, sorry. Uh, it's okay. Guys, this is Rich. His parents have a place next door. - Hey. - Hey, Rich, I'm James. Nice to meet you. How was lunch? Fine. So you live next door, Rich? Yeah. How long you had the place? Oh, a long time. Long time. Yeah, before my folks. - You want a beer? - Oh, sure. Hey, thanks. Well, no, we should... We'll... we should go. - No, hang out. Seriously. - Let's hang out. Come on. Have a seat. Let's have a drink. I don't know when the last time We took a vacation was. Well, I travel a lot with work, so... What do you do, Catherine? I manage my father's business. That sounds, like, suspicious, right? Catherine's father is a prominent New York artiste. Oh. Have I heard of him? I highly doubt it. He built that giant sculpture in Union Square. Oh, the, uh, Perisphere. Hmm... Hmm. What? I know some shit. I'm impressed. Didn't expect it. So what do you do? You monitor the Perisphere? Polish the Perisphere? - I manage his affairs. - Clerical work. No, it's not. I mean, it's not paperwork. It's not? Why do you always have those paper cuts? It's responsible work. It's dull. See, Catherine is this great artist. But she's hiding in her father's shadow Afraid to break out on her own. Thank you, but it is responsible work And I very much enjoy doing it. She's basically his assistant. Well, I don't see that there's anything wrong With being an assistant to one of our great living artists. And how many people did you beat out To win that great position? I would tell you, but I don't think you would understand The concept of a job interview. My god, you're killing me. Please don't talk to me like that. Like what? Like you're superior to me or any of us. Why not? Um, because it's dull. It's uninteresting. Well, we all can't live in a magical fantasy land. Well, I think if you use your imagination You can have a pretty good time. I think that is an incredibly ignorant And childish thing to say. Okay. Well, I don't know. I just don't think I was built for that kind of nonsense. I think I was made to be A member of the modern aristocracy. What does that mean? Hmm... because I have this great house. It's your parents' house. Which they let you use occasionally. You didn't earn it, so don't act like you're entitled to it. Why are you being so confrontational? I'm just being realistic. I'm serious. I just wanna have a nice time and relax. As opposed to what? Relaxing every other day of your life? I don't relax every day! I'm sorry you had one bad thing Happen to you, like, 3 months ago. Don't pretend that this is some break From a tedious and stressful existence. Okay, you know what? Don't worry about me. - I'm not. - Don't think about me. Just forget it. Please. Cat, come on. Oh, look who has something to say. Now you wanna get involved? No, just... we're tired. We are not tired. Don't say we. I'm not tired. Just because you're tired doesn't mean that I'm tired. That's the spirit. Well, I'm pretty tired, so... Rich is tired. Yeah, Rich is tired. I'm gonna go. - Don't go, Rich. - Yeah, don't go, Rich. Yeah, I should get home. I'll see you tomorrow. - It's great to meet you, Rich. - I'll walk you out. Nice to meet you, dude. Nice to meet you, K, take it easy. I'm sorry about that. I thought they were gonna be gone all night. That's fine. I'm interested. How so? Uh, to meet her. After hearing you talk about her. You think I'm a horrible friend. Uh, I don't know that I can really answer that. You're always very sweet to me. You ask so little of me. Uh, you sure you don't want to come in? I should get back. Alright, well, door's always open. - Just leave them. - I don't want to leave them. Why? Because no one else is gonna clean this up but me. Will you leave me alone? It was autumn, October. And we would just take long walks and... Get takeout and watch videos at my apartment. I had that basement apartment at the time So once you were inside no light could get in So you could just never even see when the sun came up. I loved that apartment. But then after a few... 6 weeks, him and his girlfriend Started to get back together And he just shut me out. We had class together, so we were polite, but, you know, It was really shitty. And that really broke my heart 'Cause it felt like he didn't choose me, you know. Um, so then, a couple of years go by, maybe longer. Maybe it was more like two and a half. And all of a sudden, out of the blue, I get this letter. Like, an actual letter, written on paper. With a pen, and it was so sweet And it was sort of apologetic But not overtly or in an annoying way and... Anyways, I agreed to meet him after work late one night. It was December. It was, like, 20 degrees out. And I was standing outside. I had that white knit cap on That I used to wear all the time. And he came out, and he just looked exactly the same. And he said that I looked the same too. But that can't be true because I had really short blonde hair at the time. And, um, we went to a bar, and we had a few drinks And he told me about how, of course His relationship inevitably ended As it was meant to. And... and he just couldn't stop thinking about me And before I even knew it I was forgiving him for 2 years of resentment For not choosing me, I was forgiving him. And his apartment was nearby So we were walking there and I asked If I could use the bathroom Which I know sounds like a really cheap move But I really did have to go. I really did think I was just gonna go in there And then leave and, but then it was really warm inside And it was so cold outside, and so we just, like, Ended up talking, and then kissing And, you know, we just fell asleep there for a while. And so we were together then through the holidays. And he came to my house and I met his parents And it was going really well. And it just felt like we were Finally getting what we didn't get In the first place, you know. And something that was so real. And it felt so important. Then a few mo... months passed and, um, He started to get distant again. And I was planning weekend trips And introducing him to my friends And just trying to really integrate him into my life. And then I realized, you know, 2 or 3 days were passing Where I wasn't hearing from him and... And it hit me that he was doing it again. He was just... he was doing The exact same thing that he did before And... and I was too stupid to realize it Before it was too late. And I knew that my problem, this problem that I have This issue that just keeps landing me in the same place. Almost 3 years later, and here I was In the exact same place was because I was... More impressed with this note This handwritten note, than I was With his supposed changes in personality. You know, I saw this... This effort, this... This textile representation of his feelings And I, I thought it was something real when it wasn't. It was just trite and cliche and fatuous. But I mean it was real. It was this real piece of paper. Which I'm ashamed to admit I carried around to, like, 3 apartments after that. But it wasn't real. It just was something that was completely empty... And hollow. And it just made me realize That I am just in this Self-perpetuating cycle of defeat. Where I can't get out of it because I can't get out of it Because I can't get out of it. It's... It's one of the worst tendencies of human nature To assume the best of others. You remember Chad? So we were friends, right? Whatever that means in middle school. He was my first kiss. Over the years, we were in the same friend group And I don't think he ever knew he was my first kiss Anyway, we never talked about it. But I'd say... Throughout high school, graduation, college He was like top 20 all-time good friends. And then after college, for whatever reason We started seeing a lot of one another. Well, we'd hang out, like, a couple times a week. Go to concerts, have dinner. And then we were just suddenly together. Hooking up, and spending the night At his place and mine, you know. Then it was summer. It was great. It was absolutely one of those summer things Where all my memories of that time Are intricately connected to him. But he was going to grad school or law school or something. So, around July, I start telling him, you know This is going where it's going and... it's not going to grad school with him. And he says he gets it. But then things start to get more serious And it becomes clear to me that He hasn't been in a serious relationship in a long time. So I keep reminding him that We're heading for a dead end And he says, "Yeah, I get it. It's fine. I get it." And I believed him. And then, suddenly, it's August. And before he's even gone, he's already... Talking about me coming to visit him And a trip he has planned to come back in... You know, in October. So... I say, "No, that's not gonna happen." None of that is real." And he thinks I am joking and... Basically ignores it all. So then he's gone and within A week or two, I'm seeing somebody else And he is still calling all the time. And one night, some Saturday night I'm out at a bar, and he calls And he's giving me the business About being out at 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning And I just snapped, and I am screaming at him and telling him he is a delusional bastard And I can't believe what I am hearing And I wanna have nothing to do with him. So that's that. It's September now, and... I don't hear from him or anything until Christmas When he's back around, obviously. And so, we are all at a bar I don't know where you were during all of this. Maybe you were away that year for whatever reason. Anyway, we see each other and... it's as if nothing has ever happened. He's civil, but I can tell he's seething. And just seeing him pisses me off so much Because I can see now what he is Which is this delusional, desperate man And goddamn it, that is so unattractive. So my point is... You can get out of somebody else's cycle But you can't get out of your own. You were victimized by his handwritten note And I was victimized by his inability to face reality. And yet... Here we both are. Where the fuck are they? Who the hell are you? It's me. Rich. From last year. Oh, right. Rich. Sorry, I'm not good with faces or names. So, you mean like... People? Yeah, them too. Heard about your dad. I'm really sorry. Don't be. You didn't know him. Eh, still. Why are you here? Well, I had to say "hey" to my girls. Surely, you can't be referring to me when you say that. Just wanted to see what was up. I saw Ginny's car outside. Don't call her Ginny. What was that? I didn't hear anything. Why is that guy here? Who? Rich? Yeah. "Rich." He likes to hang out sometimes. I don't know. Who cares? What are you up to next week? I haven't a clue. Mm, that must be nice. What? To choose to just... Hang out and do nothin'. I didn't choose to be here. Nobody would choose to be in this situation. I was thrust into this situation against my will. Yeah, I know how that feels. Because it can't possibly be that complicated. Just tell him everything is fine. I left everything in order. Yes, I told him it would be there by the end of the month. I just told him that they were extraordinary circumstances I didn't feel the need to explain it. It's a family matter. It's absolutely none of their business. Tell them what it is. It's nobody's business. Well, you are gonna have to say it in the way that I am saying it. You have to speak to him in a certain way, with a certain tone. Otherwise, he won't listen. And then the newcomer, who's all freaked out She has to cut the baby out of me... And then my water broke. It was, um, you know, I had to see it before I felt it Because I couldn't feel between my legs. But the water was ice cold, so Yeah, I was sorta trying not to jolt and then it would come out And then I turned to her, and I was like "The baby's coming. You have to cut it out of me." And I had rotted out teeth. - Really? - It was... A real winner. I just wanted to finally purge All of that from my life. I had already cut out so many worthless and negative people Who brought me nothing but annoyance or distraction So I figured why should she be any different? Because family is different. No, they aren't. Nobody gets a free pass. That's a horrible thing to say. It's horrible to feel. I wish I didn't feel it. I wish I could have relationships with some people that I can't But once they become just ciphers Or, you know, energy drains Or... or they become someone who distracts or depresses me I have to have nothing to do with them I can't help it. You can help it. No, I can't. I've tried. I just hate them. And I hate being around them. And I hate talking to them. I love eliminating those enemies From every aspect of my life. I don't think I have ever heard an adult Use the word enemy. Aw, don't be naive. It's the only word. I don't know. I think I'm taking the high road. I do. That's just not very adult. Well, you made the cut. I love you. Let's celebrate that. Lucky me. Yeah, watch your... Watch your step. I don't wanna be an enemy. I made this salad for you. It's good. You should eat it. Thank you. Sorry, I kind of, uh... Spread out. It was our only collaboration. We wanted to do something together. It was a beautiful portrait. It just turned into something else completely. Yeah. It became the image of his death. So I didn't want anything to do with it anymore. It was a morbid image. We thought it was really funny. Did you like working with him? Yeah, he was a genius. Is that a yes? Well, he taught me everything. And I know everyone said that Everything that I got was from nepotism But I didn't really care. I don't care. I just thought he was not only my father But I admired him for being a great artist. A cliched, tortured Suicidal artist... Ultimately. I think, uh, Rich is coming by later. Hmm. What? I literally didn't say anything. Exactly. - Does he have to come by? - What's the problem? I need you to stay still. I just thought we were gonna be alone together. Yeah, that's what I thought last summer. Okay. Fine. I love Rich. He's fascinating. Come on. Well, I just don't think he's good enough for you, so... I think he's just like everybody else. How do you mean? Just prying into people's business. You know, last year, he didn't ask me two questions about myself And now he just wants to know everything. I wonder why, that's all. He just knows you better. He doesn't know me at all. He's curious. Well, curiosity killed my father. Depression killed your father. I'm sorry, I really can't do this If you're not gonna sit still. Frank and Sylvie's house? I'm their niece's guest. - Virginia. - Yeah. Been here before? Just once. Last year. They're terrible people. Well, they're not here right now. I know. That kind of money rubs people the wrong way. When were you here last? About the same time last year. Nice season last year. Yeah, seemed okay. Be careful in there. You never know. You never know what? Exactly. Uh, let's see. Uh... Definitely. Aww. - Hey. - Why are you in the bushes? Where am I? Help me. I'm suck. I think you mean you're sick. Mm-hmm. Come on. Oh, hold on. Here's your hot water. Thanks. This is a nice place. Thanks. It's not mine. I think I came to a party here once. Ah. Eh, did you throw that, the "Dressed to Get Sexed" party On Labor Day last year? How many times do I have to fucking tell you This is not my house? I've seen you here though, right? Maybe. I was here last year. I knew it. I thought you said you'd never been here before. No, now that I think about it That party was at some other place. Uh. You up for a walk? No. Why not? I could murder you right now, and no one would ever know. Hm? What, do you live here now? Heard you walking around super late last night. Sounded like you were... Talking to yourself. Yeah, I was... - I was talking to myself. - Hey. Why would I be doing that? Can you please get out of my way? - Yeah, here. - No, I'm good. I'm just gonna get my own, thank you. What the fuck? What are you doing? I don't understand why you're here. - You don't live here. - What's your problem? My problem is that I'm trying to have a nice time With my best friend, and you are just here all the fucking time. Ginny invited me here, you know? Don't call her Ginny. - Take it. - I don't want it. I made you a cup of coffee. No, I don't want it. Are you... are you fucking serious? Jesus fucking Christ. You are a real fucking spoiled bitch, you know that? You ain't shit just 'cause of who your father was. How much of that did you see? Oh, well. Fuck. What? Nothing, I was just thinking. About what? Just about us. I feel sick. I feel all messed up. I'm sorry. My face hurts. All the time. Like a headache? No, it's like... Bones are grinding underneath my skin. I don't think that's a thing. Just makes it really hard to concentrate. You haven't been sleeping, have you? I could do without the attitude. The whole Catherine-is-crazy attitude. I didn't say you were crazy. You thought it. Don't tell me what I think. It's just... I know that you bring Rich around So that you can talk to him about me. Not everything is about you. I know. It's fascinating. I feel like I am... Seeing you for the first time. What do you mean? I always thought you were so perfect. I thought you had it all figured out. But you are just surrounding yourself with men. With James, with your father. They took care of you. Without them... Here you are. Hm. I think the best hope for me now Is to not end up like my father. How's that going? Mmm. It's touch and go. I just don't really feel like I exist anymore. And the only two people that... Really cared about me abandoned me. In one form or another. I care about you. No, you don't. So, you have to hold really still Because I have to do the features now. Dudes? Question? You drive a car, fly a plane Ride a bike What's the analogy for a boat? You drive it as well. I don't know, Catherine. Can you drive a canoe? Can you steer a boat? - Can you steer a canoe? - Enough with the canoe. Can't you find a counterpoint besides a goddamn canoe? It's a valid question is all's I'm saying, 'Kay. Make sure you put that on. I wouldn't want you falling in and drowning Or... something horrible like that. Ready? Hold on, I'm not buttoned. Ready, I guess. - I'm not... - Ready? It's not done yet. - Ready? - She has to get it snapped. Hey, K. K. Hey, K. My name starts with a "C." - Are you for real? - Mm-hmm. I've been calling you "K" for a whole year. Yep. That's awesome. It's not that awesome. Well, thanks for coming out on the lake today. Thank you very much for inviting me. Yeah. You know, I figured you probably just wanted to be Someplace where people weren't talking to you about... How you were doing and all that stuff. And yet, look at what you're doing now. You don't know what I'm doing. You're a real mystery, Rich. Face thing? Yeah. It hurts to talk. All of a sudden? Comes and goes. You realize how fake that sounds? Do you realize how insulting that is? Just trying to understand. No, you're trying to judge. Yeah, I don't know, I just don't feel good. I don't feel like myself. She's good, but, you know, She has this guy hanging around And he's super creepy. I just get a bad feeling. I don't feel safe. Yeah, well, they took me out on a boat today, Which was really weird. It was just dumb. And I miss you, too. Yeah? I'm sorry. Can I call you back? Okay. Okay, bye. Who were you talking to? It's none of your business. I'm just... curious. Well, I'm serious. It's none of your business. Was that James? No. Catherine... I know. Okay. You know. Hey, do you stay around here? - I'm a guest. - Where? - Here. - No, here, where, though? Here, in this house. Wha... what do you think I mean? Wait, wait, wait. I recognize you. I'm sorry. From TV. Fuck. I remember, yeah, it was your dad. He tried to rip off all those people. - That's not what happened. - Right? No, no, no, no, no, no. But then... then you had people thinking That you knew where the money was. No, that's not what happened. You obviously don't know me. So, have you known Frank and Sylvie long? I've known them for... Oh, God, I don't know, since I was a kid. Yeah. It was 20... No, like 18 years. You know, I never believed Anything that anyone said about them. Even after people came forward and testified I was always like, "No, absolutely not." Nothing weird, nothing strange. Are you okay? Jesus Christ, what the fuck is wrong with her? You alright? Catherine... This is Warlock... And Dragon. No. No! No! Ah! No! No! No! Leave me alone! No! Leave me alone! Leave me alone! Leave me alone! No! Well, that's not how I was taught to leave a party. I'm allowed to express my my opinions. Of course you are. But you're also allowed to take it down a notch. Ugh, I hate it when you say that. What's on the agenda for today? A walk? I was thinking a swim. Wanna go for a swim, sweetheart? What? Swim? You wanna go for a swim? Swim? Oh, I don't know. Uh, maybe another time. Take your time. My time. I'll take my time. I didn't expect anybody to be up. Yeah, me neither. I just wanted to tell you that I wasn't interested in you Or anything about you last night. Okay. I don't even really know these people. My friends are renting a house nearby. Yeah, I don't really know them either. How did you end up here? Oh, I guess, um... I'm... I'm friends with the niece. Thanks. Small world. Increasingly. So your father was friends with Ginny's father? I thought you didn't wanna ask? We're just talking here. Are we? What the fuck? Catherine! Shit! Damn it! Fuck, fuck, fuck! Is your face okay? Fine. Is it acting up again? Mm-mm. Does drinking make it better or worse? - Better. Usually. - Hm. You seen a doctor? Mm-hmm. I've seen a bunch of them. I've seen dermatologists, I've seen a dentist, And I've seen an ENT. I've had X-rays and MRls... And? Nothing. Sounds psychosomatic to me. Excuse me? I'm just saying, like... Half a dozen doctors tell you that... A dozen, at least. If a fuck load of doctors tells you That there's nothing wrong with you, Then what other conclusion can you possibly reach? I don't know, Rich. Maybe that they're wrong. You know more than the doctors. Hm-mm. How's Virginia's portrait coming along? Rich, cut it out. What? I'm curious. You say you've been working on it. I can't wait to see it. What is your fucking problem? Just think of all the press you're gonna get... Emerging from tragedy with such an accomplished canvas. It's really going to be quite an event. How dare you? Who the hell are you to come in and speak to me that way? I don't even know you. How dare you speak to me like that? You fucking animal. You unrepentant piece of shit. You click your tongue and you revel in the affairs of others. You are worthless. You don't know anything about me. You show up to fuck my best friend, And you pry into the lives of others To conceal how worthless And boring your own life is. I don't deserve this. I just want to be left alone. I want to be left alone with the few people Who are left in this world who are decent. You are weak and greedy And selfish. And you are the root of every problem. You... Are why people betray one another. You are why there is nowhere safe Or happy anymore. You are why depression exists. You are why there is no escape From indecency and gossip... And lies. You, Rich... You are why my father had to die. Because he couldn't live in a world like this. Was wondering if or... When you'd be back here. This was supposed to be my vacation. Ohh! Sorry if I ruined that. Why don't you like me? You know, I mean, I mean, really? You are a rich, spoiled brat. You grew up in a bubble And when that bubble popped, You expected everybody to be around and feel sorry for you. I thought I just wanted to be left alone. No. You didn't. You wanted to make a spectacle of yourself. - Yeah. - Yeah. But you don't really know me. Don't I? You were a stuck-up brat last year And... you're a stuck-up brat This year, too. So... You will never be your father. You know that? You were never going to be. In fact, I'm convinced If you weren't related to him... You probably wouldn't have gotten close to him. Cat? What are you doing? Stop. Stop it. Okay. Alright. Cat. Stop it. What are you doing? Oh. Oh, Rich, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Rich. Ginny? Ginny, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Ginny, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Oh, I made a mess. Oh, I really made a mess. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Please don't... Please don't be mad at me. Just don't leave me, okay? Ginny. I promise I'll get better. I promise. I promise I'll get better. Okay. You're not gonna leave me? Ready to go? No. Wish I never had to. I'm glad that I got to make it up here. And I'm sorry if... I ruined it by bringing, you know, what's his name? I don't remember. Same time next year? No question. You're gonna be okay. Thanks. You too. I know you've been going through a hard time, And... I just wanted to apologize If I really wasn't there for you. Well... Maybe someday you'll be going through this shit And I won't be there for you, and then well be even. God, I hope so. Alright. - No. - Yeah. The time has come. Come here. Okay, gotta let me go now. Mm-mm. I'm not letting you go. Yep, gotta do it. Don't want to. Come on. I feel uncomfortable. Okay, bye. Bye. - See you soon. - Mm-hm. Resync. Bas2003 ? 2021.
