Hey, Wally, take a look at these, will ya, I made some changes. Hi. Leave a message at the beep, and we'll get back to you. Hi, honey, it's me. Too bad you're goin' away this weekend, I miss you already. But I'll tell you what, why don't I knock off early, I'll come home for lunch, and see you off. Okay? I love you. Terrific. Boss, you got a visitor. Come in. Hope you don't mind me poppin' in like this. Oh, no, no, always glad to see ya. Wally, give us a couple minutes, will ya? - Have a seat. - Thanks. Shut up. Problem, sheriff? Well, there ain't but two people in this whole town worth goin' fishin' with. I'm lookin' at one, you're lookin' at the other one. What's your weekend like? I'm wide open, Joanna's headin' in the city today, spendin' the night with a girlfriend, goin' shoppin' tomorrow. We oughta make a night of it too, let's get some fishin' poles, and sleepin' bags, and catch us some trout. You got it. I'll pick you up at 5:00. Oh, big hand's on the twelve, little hand's on the five, can't miss it. Slow it down! What are you doin' in there, Duke? Nobody let you out? What is it? Get it! Go on, Duke, go on, go on. Go get it! That's it, stay outta those flowers. Honey, I'm home. Honey? Didn't you get my message? Yes, but I have a doctor's appointment at 2:00, and then I'm meeting Maggie, and if... If I don't head into the city now, I'll never make it, so... Well, guess I'll just have to fend for myself. I guess so. Oh, that's okay. But, um... If you try callin' me tonight and I'm not here, I want you to know the truth.. Sam and I are goin' fishin'. The, uh... The knife's been invented. Would have never guessed who came by again today. Bill scorby... Made another offer, a million and a half. Boy, he's persistent, I'll say that about him. You know if he wasn't so damn sleazy, I'd kind of find it flattering. It's an awful lot of money, sweetheart. I mean, maybe we should consider it, huh? I would sooner sell the business to the dog. Besides, who's lookin' for a buyer? What would we do if we sold the business? We'd get the hell out of here. We could go back to New York, you ever think about that? Joanna. You ever think about just taking your old job back? - Wait a second. - Do you ever think about me? I have done nothing but think about you! Do you think I left you alone in New York for five summers, and traveled 2,000 miles so I could come here and fish? No, I built this house for us! This was our dream house, remember? Away from all that craziness, quiet, fresh air, a place where we could raise our kids! Clint, we've been trying for over a year and a half, and I'm still not pregnant. We'll just keep trying, it'll happen. I want out of here. Joanna, we had an agreement. You said you'd give this town a chance. Come on, this is where I grew up, this is my home. I want this to be our home. I built this house because I love you. This? You know what this is? One big maze, and I'm the rat. Don't make it sound like I dragged you here. Well, that's how it feels, sweetheart. I have to go. Have a fun date. You know, we don't do this enough anymore. No, we don't. So how are things on the home front? Oh, they're okay. Forget I asked, it's none of my business. Well, you know Joanna. She grew up in the city. So the transition hasn't been easy for her, but she's tryin'. That's enough for now. That answer your question? Yup. You know, I can't tell you how surprised we were to see you come back, - and how glad we were, too. - Yeah, sure. I mean that. Well, New York City ten years. Hell, the only wood I could get my hands on was a pencil between my fingers. I had to come back. She'll come around, Sam. I know she will. I hope so. You and me, together we'll own 20 percent of the most exclusive clinic in Beverly Hills. You'll be on a first name basis with every movie star, producer, and ceo in town. All of them with substance abuse problems. All of 'em willing to pay me 500 bucks for an office visit. I'll leave him. I'll get a divorce. Joanna, you're looking at a year in court, maybe more. And who's to say what you wind up with? This clinic's a cash machine just waiting for us to plug into it. You want that as much as I do. I know you do. Cort, please. Look, maybe you loved Clint once, but you wound up there. Redneck county, usa, sitting on the front porch watching the opossums puke. That's not what you deserve, is it? No. I can make this happen. All it takes is money, and it's easier than you think. How easy? Did you enjoy your dinner tonight? Yes. Did you notice anything missing in the aquarium? We ate one of those? In the orient, these are a great delicacy, extremely difficult to prepare. If I'd made the tiniest slip, we wouldn't be alive to talk about it. I extracted this from the ovaries of the fish we ate. This is a toxin. How does it work? The recipient has a cardiac arrest. Quick and clean. It's almost tasteless. You can... You can put it in his food. You put it in a drink. Whatever. I never knew... Murder could be so pure. Pure. I like that. Make sure he takes all of it. Understand? All of it. I can't do this. You're asking too much, I... I won't. You don't mean that. I'm sorry. Soam I. I only wanted what was best for you, Joanna. Will I see you again? I don't think that would be fair to either of us. Do you? No. I hope it all works out for you, Joanna. I really do. Okay. Honey, I'm home. Joanna? Upstairs. Honey? Gotta see all this trout. Talkin' dinner for days. Dinner can wait. - Can'tit? - Oh, I think so. I love you. Well, here I was ready to roll up my sleeves, clean us some fish. Well, I thought we'd have steak tonight. I had fish last night. You need any help? Oh, no that's okay. Well, I'll be out in the workshop. Okay. All right, here we go. That smells great. - You scared me. - Oh, I'm sorry, whoop, did it again. Now you didn't cook all this food just for me. Oh, um, I don't know where my appetite went. I want to propose a toast. - What? - A toast. Sweetheart, you know, um... I had some wine earlier, and I just, I'm just not feeling very well. Joanna, just toast with me. Please. Come on. Yeah. To you. Joanna... Every time I look at you, I don't know how I got so lucky. Sweetheart. Honey, please. You're hurting my hand. Joanna, Joanna. Joanna, help me. Joanna! Die! Why don't you just die? Damn you, die! Die! - Hello. - It's me. - Joanna? - It's done. What? It's done. I see. Now listen, just stay calm. You've already done the right thing. What's that? You called your doctor. I'll take it from here. Right. Don't seem right, a man in his prime havin' a heart attack. Don't understand it. Well, a case like this is always a shock. But they happen more often than you know. A man as healthy... Man as seemingly healthy, as Mr. Goodman seldom exhibits symptoms beforehand. Just such a waste. Oh, god. What? Oh, that, the dog. Can't somebody please make that dog shut up? He's just upset like all of us, Joanna. I'll take him off your hands if you like, until after... 'Till things settle down. Coroner. What about an autopsy? I don't think that's necessary, but I'll defer to the coroner. I see no reason for it, Sam. All right. Sheriff, death certificate. What? We're just about done here now, Sam. All right. I'm truly sorry about this, Joanna. Thank you, Sam, that means a lot. You tryin' to give me a heart attack, too? You made it all sound so neat and simple. Joanna, keep your voice down. Well, it wasn't! It took forever, it was horrible, you should have seen him! Look, Joanna, this is a very tense moment for the both of us, but let's just get a grip here, all right? We can't afford to get sloppy now. We have a ways to go before we're out of the woods. It's over. It's done. You have business arrangements. You have a funeral. - You'll have a wake. - No, no wake. - Joanna, look... - Not after what I've been through tonight. - You gonna be all right? - Huh? Oh yeah, fine. Thanks, Tommy. You've got to relax. You've got to keep it together. And you've got to think straight. You understand that? Mm-hmm. I love you, baby, and we'll get through this somehow, okay? And if there's anything else that you need, Mrs. Goodman, anything at all, feel free to call me any time of the day or night. That's what I'm here for. - Thank you, doctor. - You're very welcome. Joanna, Helen and I are here for you. Anything you need. All right? Thank you, Sam. That girl is very distraught. She's devastated. Mm-hmm. I thought you handled yourself very well in there, if you don't mind my saying so. Not at all, thanks. It's all right, good night. Good night. Oh, stop it. I mean it, now, come on, Duke. Hey, hold up. Wait a second, come on, right here. Oh, Sam, it's late, come to bed. In a minute. You shouldn't be drinkin' beer at this hour. You'll be in and out of the bathroom - all night long. - I'm only drinkin' half a bottle. It might help me sleep. - Split it with me. - Well, I'll take a sip. Take two. You know, I was just thinkin' about the way he was after his parents died. Damn pimply kid gettin' into trouble. Ah, you set him straight. Sure did. I put the fear of god into that boy. Turned out to be a fine young man. Sometimes life just comes along and kicks you when you don't expect it, and just knocks the wind right out of you. I just can't believe that he's gone. Well, there he is bagged and tagged. Now he's gotta be pumped and dumped. First day jitters? Well, you'll get used to it. After while, they all look the same. Stiff. Well, help me peel him. Quintan funeral home, quintan speaking. Yes, Dr. Van Owen, how can I be of service? Are you sure? People often regret that decision later. Be that as it may, Mrs. Goodman is very specific. She does not want a wake. Now first, you got to get familiar with the tools. Now this here little sharp knife, this is a scalpel. Now, over here we have a Porter fluid injection system manufactured in urbana, Illinois. Now this little baby pumps the embalming fluid in through this hose, right here, while we drain the blood out through this hose right here. You ever change the oil in your car? - Uh-huh. - Same thing. Now, stay with me, boy. Now the big artery is right here. Reflex action. Happens all the time. You sure? Hell, I once had one sit bolt upright on me, and try to go for coffee. Now, we just make the incision right here. - Ah, hell. - Earl? Never mind the juice. This one goes in the ground this afternoon. Next of kin went cheap on us. No wake, no frills, even sent over their own suit to bury him in. Use that pine casket in the workshop. What, the water damaged one? Sure, just slap a coat of varnish on it. Why waste a showroom model? We're not gonna make diddly-squat on this job anyway. How's that new kid workin' out? Fine. Just fine. May the lord cleanse our departed brother in repentance. For as the good book says, "the night is fast spent, the day is at hand. Let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light." For whether we live, we live unto the lord. And whether we die, we die unto the lord. We now commend Clint Goodman's soul to almighty god. Ashes to ashes, dust thou art, and dust thou shall return. I wanna make a toast. - No, no toast! - Come on, I wanna make a toast. Yeah, come on. To my beautiful darling, the grieving widow. What a performance. - Here. - Cheers. Who is that old lady that you threw your arms around, in a paroxysm of grief, who was that? Oh, I have no idea. Ugh, that's it. - What? - I've had it with that dog. Dog? Forget the dog. Forget the dog! Hey, come on, forget the dog. Is that a gun? Well, it ain't a can of alpo. What are you doing? Oh, dukie! - What? - Oh, what a good boy! Stay. Damn! Missed. Are you nuts? Hey! Come here! Come here! Come here! You're crazy. Go, go, go! Oh my god, yeah. What do ya got? - We have boring chicken. - No. Strawberries. Oh, yeah. There's someone at the window. It's the dog. What? It's the dog. Dog. There are no liens or claims on your joint assets, Mrs. Goodman. This contains your husband's crucial documents, bank accounts, cds, and so forth. Now, as to the disposition of the business... I believe there's a Mr. bill scorby interested in buying it. Yes, I know bill. If you want, I'll give him a call right now. Please. Um, I understand that his offer stands at a million and a half. I'm willing to accept if payment can be made within 48 hours... In cash. Yeah. Honey, I'm home. - Sam. - Just thought I'd stop by, and see how you're doin'. Oh, that's very kind of you. Would you like to come in? Thanks, I can't stay long though. Can I get you something to drink, some coffee? No thanks, but I wouldn't turn down somethin' cold. How 'bout a beer? Not while I'm on duty, but thanks anyway. Or, I have soda. - Do you want diet? - Why bother? Oh, I didn't mean it. I didn't mean anything. No problem, I'm used to it. You know, I remember when Clint was building this house. Did it with his bare hands. He had a real relationship with wood, that man. Sometimes I think he was happiest when he was picking splinters out of his fingers. I noticed the for sale sign out front. Oh, the place just seems so big now that Clint's gone. Just too many memories. I hear you're selling the business too. I wouldn't know the first thing about running a business. I think you're doing the right thing. I'm sure Clint would have wanted to see it go to bill. Oh. Well, I'd like to think so. I mean, Clint always spoke so highly of bill. So you'll be leaving town? We'll miss ya. Oh, that rainstorm really kicked up some mud last night. Yes, it did. Sheriff, you're making me look bad. You're spending more time with my patient than I am. I wouldn't know about that, doc. I better say goodbye, I've got to be on my way. - Cort... - Shh. So... What did the sheriff have to say? He asked me all kinds of questions. When am I leaving town, am I selling the house. I see. Did you thank him for his concern? He even knew I was selling the business two hours after I walked out of the lawyer's office. Let's leave tonight, right now. Hey, you're shaking! If you're worried about that country boy with a badge, don't be. I mean it, cort, I cashed out all the accounts today, let's just go. The real money comes tomorrow when you sell the business. We need that money for the clinic. Cort, please. Now look, you listen to me. All you have to do is hang in with me one more night. And before you know it, we'll be in Beverly Hills sipping margaritas by the pool. Did we do the right thing? We did the only thing. All he ever saw in you was flapjacks and babies. Of course, getting you pregnant was probably the best thing he ever did. If it wasn't for that, you never would've come into my life. And I took care of the problem for you, didn't I? Yes. Like I'm gonna take care of all of your problems from now on. You know I'm right. Yes, you're right. No. That's too easy. Oh. Ah-oh! Ugh, ugh. Mrs. Goodman, I believe we have an appointment. Would you like to count it? No, I'm sure it's all there. Mrs. Goodman, I just want to say how bad I feel about Clint's passing. Getting the business this way... I'm sorry, what? You'll get over it, dear. Just takes time. Oh, yes. Can I see you out? Thank you, thank you. Goodbye. Yes! The whole damn thing's a disgrace. First, that wife of his puts him under pretty damn quick. We didn't even have time to embalm him. And now this. This is how I found it, I didn't touch a thing. What happened here? I don't know, sheriff. Looks to me like somebody dug him up. Judas priest. This could ruin me overnight if word got out. Is there any way we could keep this quiet? Dig up the coffin and take it to my home. Not to the station, then come back and fill the hole in, cover it all up. And don't breathe a word of this to anybody, I don't want any questions till after I finish my investigation, you understand? It's a hell of a thing when they start stealing bodies right out of the ground. Now who'd do a thing like this, that's what I'd like to know. So would I. - Hello. - I need you over here right now. The doctor's not in, but if you leave a message at the sound of the beep, I'll return your call as soon as possible, bye for now. Cortland, pick up the phone. Someone's been in the house, he may still be here. You better be on your way. Please, cortland. Get the gun. Duke. You're a very good dog. Yes you are. Stay. Okay. Stay. Shh, shh. Okay. You just stay there. While Joanna blows your raggedy ass to smithereens. So that's the routine. There are my beautiful girls, huh? Aw, you love your daddy, don't you? Yes, you do. And your daddy love you. So make it one for my baby, one more for the road. You wouldn't know it but I'm a kind of poet and I've got a lot of things to say. Dr. Van Owen, you are now six months behind on the rent and you've ignored three eviction nofices. I'm coming by on Monday with a federal marshal and a court order to have you physically removed from the premises. I'm sorry, but you've left me no choice in this matter. Cortland, pick up the phone, someone's been in the house. He may still be here, you better be on your way. Joanna? Joanna, darling? Joanna? Hey, babe. It never would've worked, darling, you're too much of a slob. Joanna? Ow. Ow! Ow. Joanna? Joanna. Cortland? It's time we had a little talk. I'd rather blow your brains out. Joanna? Joanna. Joanna, you can come out now. Sweetheart, I'm starting to get real annoyed here. Nol! Nol! I'm sorry. - Ow, are you crazy? - Are you all right? Oh! Why did you hit me? I thought you were, when you came down here, I thought... - What? - I thought you were him. There's somebody in the house. Who is it? I don't know. But he's locked us down here. Did you see him, what did he look like? He was wearing a mask, like a welder's thing, I couldn't see his face. I think I shot him, maybe he's wounded. Sounds pretty healthy to me. He's moving the furniture. You plan so carefully, every last detail, and then some lunatic comes along and starts playing interior decorator. Joanna, who did you tell? I didn't tell anybody. Are you sure? Of course I'm sure, what do you think, I took an ad out in the paper? I thought that was you. You thought that... You thought that I came to hurt... Joanna. How could you think that? I love you. I'm sorry. You're sorry? Here, want me to burn this? I'll burn it right now. - What are you talking about? - I'll burn the whole thing. Everything I did, I did for you. I love you. Joanna, hell, I'd die for you. Oh, sweetheart, I didn't know, I didn't know, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. It's all right, it's all right, it's all right. What are we going to do? We're going to get out of here. Right now. All right, stand back, stand back, stand back. Wait. What is it? These are blanks. - What? - They're blanks. Somebody's cut off the ends and poured out the pellets. These are nothing but gun powder and air. Who are you? All right. All right, all right. Oh, that's clever, very clever. That'll hold me about 30 seconds. Nearly took my face off. We're stuck down here. Oh, this is great. This is just great. We've got Jason upstairs and cujo in the front yard and I'm having a real good time. You've got a serious attitude problem, pal. Talk to me! Honey, you don't like the house? I can always remodel. - Ah-ah! - Shh, shh. What? Listen. What? It's quiet. How long have we been down here? Oh, about eight hours, it feels like a month. I have this figured out. I know who it is. Who? It sounds farfetched. You won't believe this. Who? Your redneck sheriff. Sam? Who else could it be? Who else could have figured it out? Why hasn't he arrested us? You don't get it. There isn't going to be an arrest. He wants a piece. Maybe he wants the whole damn pie. I underestimated him, I mean, he's not as dumb as he looks. But it's gonna cost him. What do you mean? I'm going to rip out his heart and jam it down his throat. And I'm going to laugh when he chokes on it. Yes, indeed, I'm going to rip his heart out with my bare hands. And I'm going to enjoy that. Because sooner or later, he's going to have to open that door. And he's going to have to make his terms known, and whatever they are, I'll agree to them. Nice and friendly, big smile on my face, cooperating every inch of the way. Happy to do business with you, whatever you want, pal. Whatever you say, just name it, it's yours. No problem here. And when we're finally feeling all warm and chummy and he gets close enough to take that money, I'm going to beat him to death with his shotgun. And then I'm going to dance out of here, as free as you please. I'd like you to burn the money now. What are you talking about? Prove how much you love me, burn it all right now. You were ready to do it before. This is our ticket out of here, think for a moment. - You love me? - Yes, I love you. You'd die for me? You know I would. Here's your chance, you bastard. Wait a minute here. You had this planned from the start, didn't you? It was never about me. You used me, and now you want that clinic deal all to yourself. There never was a clinic, you dumb bitch. No, baby, I'm booked on a one-way flight to the tropics. I'm going to sit on the beach earning 18 percent while I diddle the locals, and maybe, just maybe, I'll get off for a change. Ugh! Ugh! Agh! C'mere, c'mere. I'm not going to lie to you, darling. This is really gonna hurt. Well? You gonna waste that on me? No. No. It's for him. Good. Go on. What? Go on. You go. Go on. Go on, go on. You make me sick. Hello. Looks like we're going to work this thing out. Go in the dining room and turn on the light. - It's not here. - The light? The dining room. The front door was here, wasn't it? Yes. Look, I can tell that you're not ready to discuss this seriously, so I tell you what, you let me know when you are ready and we'll be in the basement. Dammit! Dammit... Joanna? I'm right here. Look, we're here to negotiate in good faith and you're making me angry. Fine, we'll sit in the living room, sit on the couch, put our feet up, discuss this man to man. Damn! Stop it. Just stop it! What? I said stop it. Hey! Hey, hey, uh, look... Let's go fifty-fifty here, huh, pal? What do you say? It doesn't get any fairer than that. Come on, talk to me! Please? Look, uh, she's the one you want. - She killed him. - It was his idea. Shut up. You didn't have the guts to do your own dirty work. You filthy coward! That's it! Cort! Cort. Oh, that's good, that's good, that's clever. That's very clever, cut her out entirely. I mean, it's my thinking exactly. Fine. All right. That window sure is a sweet sight. I don't mind telling ya. I bet I know how to buy my way through it. Well, here it is, fifty-fifty. Well, um, sixty-forty. Seventy-thirty, it doesn't get fairer than that, you know. I'll tell you what. It's yours. Every dime, okay? I mean, this is it, this is my final offer. I just want out of here, Sam, okay? Please? Sam? Keep it. Agh! Agh! Cort? Please, why are you doing this to me? Like a rat in a maze, remember? Clint. Our child, Joanna. Was it a boy or a girl? I suppose it doesn't matter. Aggh! No! No! Duke. This is sheriff eberly, we've got a 904 that's in progress out on old castle rock road. Better get the fire department out here. Well? There's nobody in there. Nobody? We searched from one end to the other, nothing. If you're looking for corpses, you're lookin' in the wrong place. Chilly today, I should've worn my topcoat. I came to pay my respects to a friend, he's buried here. Did you know him? No. He died last week, he died sudden. I never... never had a chance to tell him how much our friendship really meant to me. Maybe he knows. Hey, mister? I don't know who you are, but don't come back here, ever. Aghh!
