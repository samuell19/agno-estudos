The Frog Prince An old fairytale told me The simple heart will be prized again A toad will be our king And ugly ogres are heroes Then you'll shake Your fist at the sky "Oh why did I rely On fashions and small fry?"

This is the Last Time This is the last time That I will say these words I remember the first time The first of many lies Sweep it into the corner Or hide it under the bed Say these things they go away But they never do Something I wasn't sure of But I was in the middle of Something I forget now But I've seen too little of The last time You fall on me for anything you like Your one last line You fall on me for anything you like And years make everything alright You fall on me for anything you like And I no I don't mind This is the last time That I will show my face One last tender lie Then I'm out of this place So tread it into the carpet Or hide it under the stairs Say that some things never die Well I tried and I tried Something I wasn't sure of But I was in the middle of Something I forget now But I've seen too little of The last time You fall on me for anything you like Your one last line You fall on me for anything you like And years make everything alright You fall on me for anything you like And I no I don't mind The last time You fall on me for anything you like Your one last line You fall on me for anything you like And years make everything alright You fall on me for anything you like And I know I don't mind 15 - An Irish Airman Foresees His Death I know that I shall meet my fate Somewhere among the clouds above Those that I fight I do not hate Those that I guard I do not love My country is Kiltartan Cross My countrymen Kiltartan's poor No likely end could bring them loss Or leave them happier than before Nor law, nor duty bade me fight Nor public men, nor cheering crowds A lonely impulse of delight Drove to this tumult in the clouds I balanced all, brought all to mind The years to come seemed waste of breath A waste of breath the years behind In balance with this life, this death 16 - A Bad Dream Why do I have to fly Over every town, up and down the line I'll die in the clouds above And you that I defend, I do not love I wake up, it's a bad dream No one on my side I was fighting But I just feel too tired To be fighting Guess I'm not the fighting kind Where will I meet my fate Baby I'm a man, I was born to hate And when will I meet my end In a better time you could be my friend I wake up, it's a bad dream No one on my side I was fighting But I just feel too tired To be fighting Guess I'm not the fighting kind Wouldn't mind it If you were by my side But you're long gone Yeah you're long gone now Where do we go I don't even know My strange old face And I'm thinking about those days And I'm thinking about those days I wake up, it's a bad dream No one on my side I was fighting But I just feel too tired To be fighting Guess I'm not the fighting kind Wouldn't mind it If you were by my side But you're long gone Yeah you're long gone now 17 - Somewhere Only We Know I walked across an empty land I knew the pathway like the back of my hand I felt the earth beneath my feet Sat by the river and it made me complete Oh simple thing where have you gone I'm getting old and I need something to rely on So tell me when you're gonna let me in I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin I came across a fallen tree I felt the branches of it looking at me Is this the place we used to love Is this the place that I've been dreaming of Oh simple thing where have you gone I'm getting old and I need something to rely on So tell me when you're gonna let me in I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin And if you have a minute why don't we go Talk about it somewhere only we know This could be the end of everything So why don't we go Somewhere only we know Somewhere only we know Oh simple thing where have you gone I'm getting old and I need something to rely on So tell me when you're gonna let me in I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin And if you have a minute why don't we go Talk about it somewhere only we know This could be the end of everything So why don't we go So why don't we go Ah-ah-ah Ah-ah-ah This could be the end of everything So why don't we go Somewhere only we know Somewhere only we know Somewhere only we know 18 - Is it Any Wonder I, I always thought that I knew I'd always have the right to Be living in the kingdom of the good and true And so on, but now I think I was wrong And you were laughing along And now I look a fool for thinking you were on, my side Is it any wonder I'm tired Is it any wonder that I feel uptight Is it any wonder I don't know what's right Sometimes It's hard to know where I stand It's hard to know where I am Well maybe it's a puzzle I don't understand But sometimes I get the feeling that I'm Stranded in the wrong time Where love is just a lyric in a children's rhyme, a sound bite Is it any wonder that I'm tired Is it any wonder that I feel uptight Is it any wonder I don't know what's right Oh, these days, after all the misery you made Is it any wonder that I feel afraid Is it any wonder that I feel betrayed Nothing left beside this old cathedral Just the sad lonely spires How do you make it right Oh, but you try Is it any wonder I'm tired Is it any wonder that I feel uptight Is it any wonder I don't know what's right Oh, these days, after all the misery you made Is it any wonder that I feel afraid Is it any wonder that I feel betrayed 19 - Broken Toy I think you know Because it's old news The people you love Are hard to find So I think if I Were in your shoes I would be kind I look out for you Come rain, come shine What good does it do I guess I'm a toy that is broken I guess we're just older now I want to stay Another season See summer upon This sorry land So don't dust off your gun Without a reason You understand I look out for you Come rain, come shine What good does it do I guess I'm a toy that is broken I guess we're just older now Who says the river can't leave its waters Who says you walk in a line Who says the city can change its borders Who says you're mine I look out for you Come rain, come shine What good does it do I guess I'm a record you're tired of I guess we're just older now I guess I'm a toy that is broken I guess we're just older now 20 - Atlantic I hope all my days Will be lit by your face I hope all the years Will hold tight our promises I don't want to be old and sleep alone An empty house is not a home I don't want to be old and feel afraid I don't want to be old and sleep alone An empty house is not a home I don't want to be old and feel afraid And if I need anything at all I need a place that's hidden in the deep Where lonely angels sing you to your sleep And all the world is broken I need a place where I can make my bed A lover's lap where I can lay my head 'Cause now the room is spinning The day's beginning 21 - Crystal Ball Who is the man I see Where I'm supposed to be I lost my heart, I buried it too deep Under the iron sea Oh, crystal ball, crystal ball Save us all, tell me life is beautiful Mirror, mirror on the wall Lines ever more unclear Not sure I'm even here The more I look the more I think that I'm Starting to disappear Oh, crystal ball, crystal ball Save us all, tell me life is beautiful Mirror, mirror on the wall Oh, crystal ball, hear my song I'm fading out, everything I know is wrong So put me where I belong I don't know where I am And I don't really care I look myself in the eye There's no-one there I fall upon the earth I call upon the air But all I get is the same old vacant stare Oh, crystal ball, crystal ball Save us all, tell me life is beautiful Mirror, mirror on the wall Oh, crystal ball, hear my song I'm fading out, everything I know is wrong So put me where I belong 22 - Bedshaped Many's the time I ran with you down The rainy roads of our old town Many the lives we lived in each day And buried altogether Don't laugh at me Don't look away You'll follow me back With the sun in your eyes And on your own Bedshaped And legs of stone You'll knock on my door And up we'll go In white light I don't think so But what do I know What do I know I know! I know you think I'm holding you down And I've fallen by the wayside now And I don't understand the same things as you But I do Don't laugh at me Don't look away You'll follow me back With the sun in your eyes And on your own Bedshaped And legs of stone You'll knock on my door And up we'll go In white light I don't think so But what do I know What do I know I know! And up we'll go In white light I don't think so But what do I know What do I know I know! Thanks for watching. I'll hope you've enjoyed my subtitles.
