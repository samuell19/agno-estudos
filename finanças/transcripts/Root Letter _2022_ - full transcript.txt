- Get off my daughter! - Dad, no! What the... please don't... no! Hey, Sorino. Asshole wore rings? How long have I been out? Three days. Drove right when I heard. Got to get back tonight. Oh, mom, she's gonna leave... I got a hold of her yesterday. I got a hold of her yesterday. She'd give anything to be back in the States, Sobrino. Talked to your landlord. Got to fix it up to end of the month. But I don't appreciate that you used my... I didn't use your name. Credit. My application would have been bust. Otherwise, oh, fuck. Why did you give them my social? A little begging. Not little. Bullshit. Probably it wasn't easy to find. She would've just asked. You would have said no. I'm moving to Houston. And I wanted you to come with. I stay here because of her. Where did that got you? She stopped by. Oh, come on, man. Are you... School's going to send homework from now on. Say anything else? No. Mom, is he still here? No. Can you get dressed? I don't need to be there. It helps if you're there. You mean, it looks good if I'm there. I'm gonna stop. Once my back heals up, I'll stop. If my back hurts, then I'm gonna drop below 40 hours. And I can't work if my hours drop a below 40 the probation officer, like, Sarah, you know that that can't happen. It just can't. Me knowing doesn't make it an excuse. It's not an excuse. I just need to feel like I used to. I need us to feel like we're used to. Some of you have to work on your caps key. We also need to work on writing things by hand with paper and actual pens. And in order to do this, we're gonna... be writing letters. Put a... Let me finish before you start to cry. These are gonna be your pen pals. No addresses chosen randomly from participating schools across the country. As you can see, you have to write at least four letters to them in the course of the semester. And in order for me to grade these letters we're gonna be using... this box. You will drop off your sealed envelopes, which I will send and mark as received as part of your grade. And the other part is to see if your pen pal wrote you back. And guys, this is important. Do not give out any personal information, none of that. But aspire and enjoy it. We're gonna have fun with this. Thank you so much. Your pen pal is in Tulsa, Oklahoma Central High School. Your pen pal's name is Carlos. Dear Carlos, is it weird to say dear? The assignment says my greeting is supposed to be affectionate whether I know you or not, but... I guess that's the point to get to know you. So, let's see. I'm a senior, born and bred in Baton Rouge. I've never left, but I'm dying to. My play list consists of anything with powerful lyrics. Lourd, Billie Eilish, Florence, and The Machine. Dear Sarah, it was nice to get your letter. Any distraction from this hospital room's a good distraction. Do you write a lot because you read really well. I don't write often, but I'll try. I'm also a senior. I was born in Mexico, but moved to Texas and then to Tulsa. I don't think you'll like the type of music I listen to but I love Slayer, Metallica, Linkin Park. Dear Carlos, you can't just say hospital and not say more. Are you all right? Also, wow. You're a metal head? I didn't see that coming. But if you're going to try writing, then I'll try something new too. I'm gonna listen to Slayer. Line your notes in hand and yes I do write a lot. It's something I can control. The words can be mine with no one able to barge in and change them. Little blue lines, the only guides, everything else is just white, and wide open space. Sometimes being with people is lonelier than being alone but I never feel lonely when I'm writing. I love my best friend, but we couldn't be more different. She's this place. And she thinks it's enough. Don't even get me started on her boyfriend. Here's one friend though. He's different. I know he's a good guy but he sometimes gets pulled down into all the bad stuff. It's hard, feeling like you're alone in the world around you. Dear Sarah, it's awesome that you're gonna listen to Slayer. Most people, they wouldn't. They just say it's noise. Wouldn't even bother to pay attention to the lyrics. I'm looking forward to reading what you think, even if you don't love them as much as I do. As for the hospital room, well... I just say you can't save everyone. Lesson learned again. Dear Carlos... Dear Sarah... Dear Carlos... Dear Sarah... Dear Carlos... Dear Sarah... Dear Sarah... Dear Sarah... Dear Sarah... I'm not sure if any of my letters are guaranteed anymore. I hope so. I know you're dealing with a lot. This is probably the last time I write. So I've included my number and address below. I'm glad I got to know you, Sarah. And I hope you're okay. You once wrote that I'm not doing it all alone. And neither are you. Know that I'll always be a friend. All right. 55 cents. - What? - No postage. So, 55 cents. Jesus. They just charge me for everything. Here you go. You have a great day. Dear Carlos, I killed him. It's my fault. I wanted to ask for help but I didn't know who to ask. I'm sorry. Remember me as a friend. We're good, Caleb. You didn't know. But I mean, fuck, you sure, we can do this? We'll move them quick. My guy can give us a script next weekend. Week's a long time Jackson, and my uncle, if he finds out. He won't, Caleb. Fuck. It'll work. Look, this is what we agreed to. I don't know what we're doing. It will take an hour long. All right? It's a quick buck for a quick fucking bucks. Sarah, I've texted him. Can we talk? I don't know Mia. I... Listen, what I did. I can't even begin to explain. Then don't. Your explanation won't fix anything. No Sarah, wait... She's a piece of shit. She didn't used to be. That was before she slept with Mike. Why are you standing up for her? I'm not standing up for Zoe. I just... I just changed. No, she changed and you got screwed over by it. Dear Carlos. You're right. You can't save up a life. But sometimes you can help. You might think you're doing it all but you're not. Every letter you've sent matters. I feel like you get me. And you're listening. Being heard means a lot. Especially at a time like this. I'm sorry to leave you hanging. So, the least I can say is, I'm listening. I'm a friend who has her share of bruises too. And I happily care just like you do. Let him go! Please, don't, no! This doesn't mean anything. We're just... we're just having fun. I know. I just wanna do this for you. Heard you're not with Mike anymore. You heard right. Yeah, I get it. I don't think you do. No, I do. Couldn't keep a girl like you happy. Girl like me? How, how you, how you act. Talk. You deserve better than this place. You ain't like others. But her... I'm just saying... I see it. And I get it. Dear Sarah... no one's asked me about my favourite memory, but it was my first bike. It was old with a long banana seat, meant for a girl, but I didn't care. I ripped off the front basket and it was mine. I remember riding around at this lot next to our apartment. Crashing constantly. That's flying each time I did like the cartoons, but the whole time my mom was right behind me. Hand on the seat, maid uniform still on. Smiling. Like it was going to make me go faster. I kept turning back to see her and when I did that, I turned and I lost my balance. She was there. Ready to let go when I had enough speed... or hang on when I didn't. Yo... you know where the English teacher would be at? Yes, round the corner. Round the corner? Great bro, thank you. Wait, to the left or the right after this? To the right. Okay, appreciate it. How did she get your address? I gave it to her. You weren't supposed to. I mean you can't tell us to be friends and then just expect us to stop. It's not fair. I never read any of these. I always just assumed students would write one line and send it. - But Sarah was... - Impressive. She was. She had it in her yearbook meeting her term. I was hoping she'd put her writing talents to use there. But see, she did in these. I like to help you, but I can't. All I need is his number and email, anything. If I give out personal information, I could lose my job. I won't tell anyone. What I can do... is say that everyone's in the year book. Even if they don't want to be. There you are. Sarah Blake. I wonder why you always forget the last layer. This stuff always looks better on you. Through the night we rise in pairs Lords at night we ride. What? Nothing. They're just lyrics. I don't know how you can stand that thoughtful dream pop shit. It's from Slayer actually. Fuck. I can't even. Your pen pal is turning you into a freak. One letter at a time. Carlos is just introducing me to something new. The guys are here. Let's go. - Do you want one? - No, I'm, okay. Oh, gosh. So you got a now, like a drink or something? Yeah. Excuse me. I'm sorry for Mike and I... did. He cheated on me. And you let him. I know, but I want to fix what's between us. I mean, whatever you need me to do. The moment I needed you was when you had a choice. Whether you pick him or me. Then you chose. Fuck! Caleb! Hey, what the fuck! Stay where you're at man. Don't be acting all dumb. You ain't gonna do this alone. Is anyone in there? Go. Not him. Just you. I do hear from fucking Ruby, he was pushing behind my back, not... If I wanted to talk to y'all I'd do it in my own house where your mama bandaged you but you won't man up. Now we can do that. You won't let your little friend handle it like y'all were. Man, get your ass back in that house. Come on man, get in there. Hey, look, man, Caleb and me we're gonna pay you back right where we... Now my nephew's in there for a reason. He's fucking dumb as shit but we're blood. You need to convince me not to do something about this cause well, I'm itching to. We got a guy that's coming to it, the script. We're pedaling yours, fifteen for the tens 40 for the roxies. We pay him and puts your trucks back without you knowing we give money in between. So you playing the game with my dogs? Now how much you got left? This ain't enough. Yeah, no, man that's enough. It was enough before you fucked me over. And now I need double. Double? Not fucking, that's impossible. It's fucking generous. Welcome to the table. Sarah, you okay? I'm fine, just... I just need... Hello? Gosh. Sorry. You know, I get a little lost in here. Do you want some coffee? It'll be ready in a few. I have to have tea around here somewhere. No. Where am I? - My shoes, phone. - It's okay honey. You're safe. And you're here so everything's fine. - Hello. I'm William Hayden. - She knows. Diane. - Sarah Blake. - Sarah. That's wonderful. How about we get your shoes and give you a minute. Diane, maybe coffee. I heard a noise. I thought someone went back to my cans again, but I found you passed out. Sorry. No, no. Look, it's... it's none of my business. I brought you in but Diane made sure you were tucked in. That's my daughter, Ella. She's beautiful. Yeah, she was. She... She left for a friend's house almost three years ago. She never got there. She never came back. - The police? - I... They started off strong but... but El's case was never closed. And they never legally declared her so... So they never found out what happened to her. No. I didn't mean to I'm sorry. Yeah. Well, we are too. Thank you for everything. Wait. The morning still carries a chill. - No, I couldn't, but thank you. - Here. If you ever need anything, you know where we are. Dear Carlos, that memory is amazing. I remember when I was young, seven, maybe. My friend and I would spread out our toys on a carpet. Running down a long hotel hallway. The carpet had large blue stripes circling around these green wisps like branches. At one moment the design was a road. Then little cars would speed around. The next an ocean, where her brother's action figures would swim fast distances to save the Barbie we shared between us. Carpet was whatever we wanted it to be. Everyone else just stepped on our roads or oceans. They didn't see that it was important for two little kids and that it's still important to me. Hey, wait wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Mom! Is it just you? Yeah. It's just us, Kitten. Baby girl come. Come sit with me. We don't sit and talk. Did you eat? No, there's nothing. I got go to this door. I just first, I just need to. Kitten. You have such pretty hair. You got hair like your daddy. Feels nice too. Dear Sarah. I don't know what to write. It's... it's terrible. I'm sorry. Your mom was right there but not in the way you need her to be. You deserve better. Sometimes. I wish it was just that easy. My mom still tells me over the phone. Sana, sana, colita de rana. Si no sanas hoy, sanarás mañana. If you don't heal today, you'll heal tomorrow. It might not be better now but it... it will be. I promise. Sarah, wait! Wait. Hey, I got your letters. Oh, my God. Nothing. Please don't hurt me I'll do whatever you want. Hey. I'm not going to try to hurt you. I just thought you were someone else. I just want to talk. That's all. Just talk. Since you're right here... It was already trashed when I got here. Trailers don't have much copper in them. So the beggars they don't attack them, like they do the houses and in Neahwa Park. Right. And Sarah Blake. Told you I don't know no Sarah. Yeah. Never seen her? Do you know her? So we warned her... And Caleb couldn't find it anywhere. No, he said he looked everywhere. I'm sorry. I'll buy you another one. I don't care about the sweater. It always made me look anyways. You don't know who it was? No. It happened so quick, he... he tried and... he just stripped off the sweater and I just ran. Just got away. I'll handle it. We sold them and we ain't got double. What about your car with the scripts? They'll come through. Fuck. Maybe we should've never done this. Well, it's done, right? We wanted this. Not me, it's what you want. And I was kind enough to cut you in, and what is it that you've ever wanted that you actually got without me? Is it money? Some place of your own? Is it Sarah? Now, I see it... but she don't bud, right? And she never fucking will. If it wasn't for me she wouldn't even be near you. She wouldn't even fucking look at you. Just lucky over there. Lucky or not, it's weird. Some girl's bedroom. Covering you with stuffed animals? I can't remember the last time someone tucked me in. They want me to come back, have dinner with them. Crazy woman cooking, but... No, she just, she wanted me to be someone else. It's a free meal, I guess. It's what's trying to keep me to come, though. Kevin, looks like a CDS. Vicodin, valium, oxy, bullshit - Full bottles. - Christ. Sounds like she needs a farm just to stay on both feet. Where did you get this? Mom, stop... What did you do for it? - What did you fucking do for this? - I didn't do anything for it. - What? What is it? - It's Zoe's. Zoe lent it to me. You have no idea what I go through every single day for shit like this. You never fucking know. I'm gonna need you to do something for me. He just needs you to steal some only a few to come clean without them. Half the kickers and perks, leave the rest and all the lift with them. Why did you have to tell him? I didn't. I didn't. Then why are you doing this? It's not our problem. It's his, there's. You're asking me to crack something that I don't need to. I'm asking you to help, he needs me and I can't do this without you Please. For me. Hi, Mr. Hayden. What? Good morning. I'm looking for, for Sarah Blake. We don't know any Sarah. Did she send that photo to you? No, I found it at her house. Surprised that shit still send them. - Sarah, does she ever reach out... - I haven't seen her or heard from her in like a year so... So you don't know where she's at? I don't know... or care. But you used to care. Yeah. So did she. She used to talk about you, you know, about your letters. Your Slayer shit. I always thought you were itching to fuck her - but you never showed. - No it was never about that. Did she ever mention me? No. She mentioned friends and... family but... it was mainly about her. About her thoughts and her feelings. You never knew what was going on inside of her head. And everyone wanted to know, everyone wanted to get to know Sarah. She have any other... - friends, family. Anybody else? - There's no one else. Literally, anything you tell me - can help me. - I told you, I don't know anything. You don't know or you can't tell me? Can't do one without the other. What fuck are you looking for? I don't know what happened, but she wasn't home. The last time I saw her, she wasn't there. Where was she? A house. In Eden Park. Birds painted on the mailbox. You're not going to find anything. Maybe not. But I'm already here. You got money this time? Someone's asking about Sarah. What'd you tell him? I'll make it worth your while, so... No, I know you don't eat meat, so let me know if the pota... Sorry. Sarah. Just let me know if you need anything else. Thank you. This looks amazing. You know... Diane hates when I do dishes and she says I never do them right. My mom is telling me that one cooks, someone cleans. Well, your mom sounds like a good woman. Do you... You look so much like our daughter, Ella. That's why I had to take and bring you in that night. And Diane, well, you noticed. When Ella left us, Diane did too. Would you mind if I stayed over? It's just, my house is a little far and my mom, she... Of course, you can. You're the best thing that we could wake up to. And... Even if tonight is the only night we could have dinner with you. I'm really glad you're here. Listen, stop. I've got it. Dear Carlos. I hope tomorrow's better. I'm glad you think it will be. You hear people say they want to be rich, famous, both. And I find myself sometimes wishing to be something else. Normal. Like the community college student working part-time at a grocery store. It's not a big wish. Just a push to get into a life that is better than the one we have. Simple, safe. Hello? Excuse me! Do you know who used to live here? Do you know? Who do... You keep looking for the bitch you're gonna wind up like she did. No. I'm sorry, okay. He just busted you. I was willing to do this for you, not for him. - Get the hell out of my house right now! - Okay. We don't want. Sarah, wait. Alright, let's fucking go. - We need help! - We need to get him help! Fuck, dude. Fuck. You think anyone saw us? We got what we needed. And we got out. He just fell. - No, dude. - He fucking fell! Let me out. Jackson, let me out. Let me fucking out! Sarah, wait! You stay fucking sound. Don't say nothing. We're all going to be fine. Just so long as you don't say nothing. Let go of me. Jackson, let her go. I will, I will. But just know, we're all in this. She didn't have to be, I was giving you what you wanted. And now, we have to call them we need to tell them. Oh, and tell them what? Oh yeah, dinner with Ma and Pa out of the kindness of your own heart? You agreed to this. You know, what happened there, that was an accident, but don't make it out to be more than it is. You understand me? She ain't wrong, man. - We, we can't just... - Yes, we fucking can! We fucking can. Fuck... Fuck. All this fucking. You stay fucking silent. You understand? Fuck you! She won't say anything, man. Sarah, nothing was supposed to happen. What is this, Zo? How can you do this to me? I was doing this for you, not for him. Not for him. Just look in the trunk, Zoey. - Just fucking look. - What do you mean? Wait, Sarah wait! Mom? I just need you to be here, please. Dear Carlos. Every surface of my life is dirty. But I can't wipe it clean. The filth just builds, hiding what's below until it's forgotten. In a place where nothing reaches. Friends. Sun. Sounds. Life. I wonder if what's being hidden is broken beyond repair. Cracks to the point where you can't see who's looking back at you. If you're the person you want to become, or the person you're so scared of being, no one will let you in. No one will forgive you. Find you underneath the filth that you helped create. And while we don't have all the details, at least two were pronounced dead on the scene, with one a yet to be identified teenager. Gunshots were reported late last night, but as of this airing no suspects have been identified. At least two were pronounced dead on the scene with one, a yet to be identified teenager. Did he send you? Jackson's seen you going back there to her house. So you never saw what was in his car? - What he was holding? - No, listen, this is important. He thinks you're gonna talk or tell someone. Tell her what? That it was my fault? You know, I can't say anything. Then at least stay away from her. I can't, she didn't deserve any of this. And you're trying to make it right? I'm just trying to get away from things in my life that are wrong. Including me. If you stay with him, yes. Just let her be, please. Where were you? - What do you mean, I was... - Yesterday? I fucking waited for you. I needed you to be there with me at my appointment. I can't be well. Without you, I can't make any of this work without... I'm not a fucking excuse! I'm not the reason you're like this, you're the fucking reason. And my life just gets pulled down into it. You need a fucking excuse. What the hell is that? I'm not your father. Tell everybody I did it. You have no idea. None. You don't know the pain that I've been through every God damn day, trying to provide for you. You're sorry, selfish, spoiled little ass. It is constant! Constant! And I just want to provide for you. What kind of providing is this? I come home every day, not knowing what I'm going to get. Sometimes I wish that you're still Goddamn high that you'll just let me swing out of here and never return. Then fucking do it. Leave. Get the fuck out. You're not special. You're not. So why don't you just leave me here with the little enjoyment I have left because I don't need your judgment. Fine. You want enjoyment? Fine! This is what you are? If this is more important than me then the least that I could do is help. - Stop it. Stop it. - No, no, no. You said that you wanted me to be a helpful, dutiful daughter. Don't! Just stop it! I'm always there for you more than a daughter should be. And for once, for once I wish you'd be there for me. Stop! - Who was it? - I don't know. No, you do. I told you, I don't know. No! You do, you do. And I was conveniently jumped for it. I looked up what happened at the house. Was it Sarah? Did she die? Please. I need to know. I can't stop now. - I have come this close. - She didn't stop. I asked her to stop, to walk away. God if she would've just listened to me if she would've just not shut me out, nothing would have happened. So you know what happened. You were warned. Worse is going to happen. Maybe to meet. I need to know what happened. I need to know what happened. Who was it? Mom? Hi. Mom? Mom? Did you take two eighties? No... No, I wasn't supposed to be like this. I just... Please, help us. I wasn't supposed to be like this. Just wanted you to be happy. Just want you to be happy. Always... I once loved your hair. You're almost like your father. Your eye. What happened to your eye? It's nothing. Wait, Ella Joan Hayden he'd wait right... I'm not your daughter! I'm not her! She's not coming back! Okay? Trust me, you'd never want me as your daughter. You'd never even considered me up for. Nah, you can score over at Oaks junction. I ain't here to score. Then fucking leave. I need to talk to you. No, you need to get the fuck outta here. It's important. It ain't important to me. Listen... we need to talk. I'd ask you again. You need to fucking get. Caleb, is that... - Fuck did you just said? - We need to talk about Caleb. I'm sorry, Ella. Sarah... you gotta go. You kind of grab everything right now and go. - Caleb, what do you mean? - He's here. What are you doing? I'm sorry. I didn't think he... Now I get why Jackson kept you high. Keep you from being fucking trouble. You got till I finish. Alright. What do you remember from that night? Caleb took my gun, tried to swap some meds from abroad in Eden Park. Got hairy, but she knows this. So why the fuck do you care? Cause Caleb never did that. He went there to help. Bullshit. He went there cause he was fucking dumb. Found a manned up, got himself fucking shot. And who shot him? The only one with a finger in a gun broads included can stand their ground. They never found a gun. Every article, every report, they said the gun was never found. Doesn't change the fact he got a bullet through his chest. I told the cops, he took it. That's all they needed to know. It don't matter to me if they can't find it. But it's not lost. Never was. Why are you telling me this girl? With him no less? Cause we need to know. About what? Why he killed your nephew? Maybe he did the same to Sarah. Jackson, please! Go! Ella, please. Go! Sorry, Ella. You got to get out of here. Now. I'm right behind you. Get him the fuck over here. If you wanted that element of surprise you should've parked around back. Where's Adam? He's out. And I'm not the surprise. Have a seat. Where the fuck did you get those and that? Doesn't matter. I'm here because you fucked up. I said I'd pay the price for it. I just need to know how high. The Haydens, Caleb. Caleb? He just got in the way. And Sarah? Did you kill her too? Did you kill them? Why the fuck would I tell you that? You're coming here, got your chest fucking puffed. Do you think that you're going to leave? Yeah. I want an answer. This whole time that you're trying to act tough I'm just trying to remember how many bullets I've left in that gun. If you find her, tell her I'm sorry about everything. Fuck! Sorry, I'm just about done. Sarah and I were friends for as long as we could remember. My family owns this hotel and her mom worked here. During her shifts, Sarah would come over and we'd.. Put on the carpet? Yeah. We'd be in our own innocent world. Has stepping around us. But then we grew up. They ruined it. It happened just after this photo was taken. She didn't talk to me for a while. - But then... - She came here. To ask for help. Go to the bathroom. I've got clothes for you. I think we're still the same size. These are for tonight and I've got a few more for tomorrow. Thank you. Is everything okay? No. Do you want to talk about it? The next day she left, took a bus, gave me your address, told me to wait to send a letter after a year. With nothing and trace back to me, I guess. She said that if it was meant to make it to you, it would. Did she tell you where she was going? No, I tried, but she wanted to protect me, us, I think. Someone she shouldn't have forgiven but dead and someone she never met. That was Sarah. - She was... - A friend. Are you gonna keep looking? I don't know where to look. Here on my last. Thank you. I'm glad that she... she wasn't alone. She had you. No, just keep that. For you to remember her by. Ella. Ella Hayden. She said that she felt better as her.
