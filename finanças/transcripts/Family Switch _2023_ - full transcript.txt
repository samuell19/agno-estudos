Kids, it's time for the annual Christmas video. Uh, not right now, Mom. What are you talking about? You used to love these. The key word being "used to." I think we're too old for that. It's kind of embarrassing. How about you, buddy? Come on. Wyatt, can you hear me? Grab your guitar. Let's do this. You just made me die in the Dwarf Mines. How about joining us in the physical world? Five minutes. I tried the physical realm... I will take the digital realm. - Miles? - Miles. - You with us, buddy? - Miles. - Pickles. - Where is Pickles? - Oh God. - Pickles. The tree is not your territory. Oh, honey, watch out. Your cane. You're hooked. You're hooked. I'm okay. We're okay. Hey, Bill, when did this family give up on Christmas? New rule in this house. No more tinsel. I mean, CC used to just love making those holiday videos. I mean, this stuff just gets everywhere. And Wyatt was a natural performer. He had moves like Jagger. How does so much pee come out of that tiny, little dog? I worry that we're all kind of disconnected. Sorry, did you ask me something? - Hmm. Sorry? - What? Hmm. - It's fine. - I can't hear... What? - No. No. - Oh. - Okay. - Good night. Good morning, Los Angeles. Only three days till Christmas, and another hot holiday season here in the Southland. Don't forget us, Santa Claus. Seventy-six degrees, and the mercury is rising. Speaking of Mercury, make sure to look at the sky tonight for a once-in-a-lifetime planetary alignment. And of course, keep listening to 99.3 KMCG to catch the Christmas spirit. Okay. Really good ideas, team. But don't do anything without me. I'll get after it when I get in. CC! Oh my goodness. Do you think it's good for you to live like this? Mom, I'm trying to get ready for my game. I don't need a clean-room lecture. It all ties together. A disorganized room means a... A disorganized mind. Yes, I know. It affects everything, including your soccer. More importantly, your grades. If I hope to play for the national team, I need to focus on practice, not cleaning my room. Heads up. You're not supposed to use your hands. In the kitchen, 12 minutes. Hey, Bill? ♪ You shoot for the stars ♪ ♪ If it feels right And in for my heart... ♪ - Bill. You okay? - Yes. Yes. I'm hanging out. You know how much the baby loves the Camaro. - Oh, the baby. - Where's Mommy? You driving it to work now that it's done? - Show it off? - You kidding me? You put this much time into a car, you don't drive it. I mean, you barely even touch it. You just bask in its power and beauty. When you're done basking, can you make sure Wyatt is up and dressed and in the kitchen ready for the meeting? Spock, your work was impeccable as always. But I figured out why that lens you fabricated isn't refracting properly. You forgot to square the C. Your work is exquisite. No, my 1999 PSA-graded 10 holo Charizard is exquisite. I am envious of that card indeed. Wyatt, family meeting downstairs. Let's go! Who's this? Are these your smart friends? The algebros? Guys, I gotta go. Spock, tell Elon he owes me another one. So I was just thinking, maybe after school today, we can hang out. I can teach you how to drive. Gasoline engines are an abuse of science. And you know this. I'm too scared to drive. I'm also in the middle of a lot of prep for my Yale interview. I really can't slack off. Totally get it. Totally get it. Can you, uh, can you help me with this problem? - I'm kidding. You can't help me. - No, I can't. Okay, I'm calling this meeting to order. We have a major few days ahead of us. - CC, do I have your attention? - Yeah, I'm looking for my homework. Looking for it like a completed assignment, or like school starts in 20 minutes, and you need to get started? That'll be option B, Mom. When do you find out if you got into college early? I would really love to help you pack. I detect sarcasm, which is universally regarded as the lowest form of humor. Let's, uh, move this along. You know if we talk too much, he just clenches up. Right. Tomorrow is a big, big day for the Walkers. We have Wyatt's Yale interview, CC's championship soccer game. I have my huge presentation at work... Don't forget about the Planetarium today after school. I was getting to that. We're going to Wyatt's thing. I have band practice. Dad or Alive is playing at the school holiday party. This could be my second chance. I really don't wanna go to Wyatt's boring thing. It's a quintuple planetary alignment. It's a galactic confluence of the highest order of magnitude. It's my interstellar white whale. Okay, seriously, who's his real father? Look, you guys might not care about Christmas, but I do. So we are all going to the Planetarium this afternoon. I have a cute holiday sweater. I want a picture. We are gonna make a happy memory as a family. Can this meeting be adjourned? Meeting adjourned. - Ava! - CC! Go, CC! Go, CC! Go, CC! Yo, hold on. Yo. - Yo, put your hands on the moneymaker. - Hey, I got it! - I'm a Spartan! Ah! - Where the hell is he? - I promise you... - I am Hunter Drew! I'm the Spartan! Go, CC! Go, CC! Go, CC! ♪ And I would do anything for love ♪ ♪ I'd run right into hell and back ♪ ♪ I would do anything for love... ♪ Whoa. Walker. You're standing in the hallway and staring at Ariana? Yo, Ariana! Dude, this kid's starting to cream! I'm sorry. I promise... You just got obliterated, son! You're a loser, Walker. One, two, three. Okay. Okay. Uh, you... Uh, cut, cut for a second. Um, there's tension. Do you feel the tension in this room? We gotta be loose. Toss your music. Toss your sheet music. Get rid of it. Emma, why are you raising your hand? Embrace the anarchy. Just call it out. What do you got? How do we play the song without sheet music? How did Luke Skywalker blow up the Death Star without his computer? I don't know what that means. I was born in 2008. Okay. Um... Baxter? - He used the Force. - Yes! What's the Force? The Force is this enigmatic energy that's inside all of us, and it's good. Guys, you're in a band. You're not individual players. You guys are a thing. You're one thing. So get out of your heads and get into everyone's heart. You, walk a mile in her shoes. Walk a mile in his shoes. Everybody, just try to feel what it means to be a collective. Now, come on. Let's give Jack White the honor he deserves. Go. Drums, please. Yeah. Melody, strings. Woodwinds. Bring it up. Let's go. Who's feeling it? Oh, boy. Cymbals, get ready. Cymbals. Did you feel that? What... That... Something's going on. I gotta take just a second. McCracken, you're in charge. Uh, run through "Jingle Bells." I'll be right back. Guys, what's up with the emergency Dad or Alive meeting? Do not tell me, Lake, that you sprained your whammy wrist again. No, we heard from a little TV show called So You Think You Can Rock? - What? - We got the audition! Yeah! Guys, do not mess with me. I'm super fragile right now. There's a TV crew coming here to the school dance on Friday for a live broadcast. Dad or Alive is about to be famous! What? This is insane! - It's incredible. Come on! - Yes! ♪ You're packed and you're stacked 'Specially in the back ♪ ♪ Brother, wanna thank your mother For a butt like that ♪ ♪ Or a shotgun, bang What's up with that thang ♪ ♪ I wanna know, how does it hang? "Straight up, wait up, hold up, Mr. Lover Like Prince said, you're a sexy mother..." You'll have to work harder to stump me on iconic ladies of the '90s, Gus, Gus. You're so good. - All your faves. - Thanks. Would they be holiday cookies without M&M's? Please. Give me some credit. - Ah. There she is. Good morning, Kara. - Good morning. Triple-shot juggernaut. Remixed just the way you like it. - Oat milk? - Oh, yeah. - Thank you. - We learned. Do you believe this, boss? My son's snake bit me. That's what I get for trusting the pet store. They told me it was harmless. Turns out to be a water moccasin. I'm so afraid it's gonna ruin the pitch. No, not at all. I mean, you can barely even see it. No one will notice. - Oh, thanks. - Merry Christmas. Is that who I think it is? - Are you ready for the pitch? - I am now, Glen. - These are for you. Your favorites. - Thank you so much. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. So The Molson Group called to confirm tomorrow's pitch, and Mr. Hanes wants to set a meeting with you and the partners, his words, "after we close this deal." You're about to become the first female partner in the history of this firm. - If I close Molson. - Oh, you will. Well, not if Steve snakes it out from under me. - Hey, Steve. - Jess. Wow, I love your haircut. It, it kinda makes your nose look smaller. Did you review the pitch document I sent you? Oh, yes, yes, I did. And I gotta say, I love reviewing your work. It just makes me feel more intelligent. Any notes? No. Let's knock 'em dead in there tomorrow. All right? - Yes. - You two thoroughbreds? And, by the way, you close the deal, somebody's making partner. Partner. Good luck. Oh, you wish. Just know, your team is here to help. Oh, you guys are the best. I think I've got it under control. I know, I know. You like to do everything yourself. Yeah. You're so sweet, but ultimately, it is my responsibility. - Aye, aye, captain. - Yeah. There we go, CC. Take it down the field. Oh my God. Literally the best soccer player I have ever seen. No offense. Yes! Hey, Walker. The War of 1812 called. It wants its cannon back. - Thanks, Coach. - That is a foot! Do I have a surprise for you. A scout for the national team is comin' to the game tomorrow. Are you serious? Your mom won't be happy, 'cause you'd have to leave home, but this is an opportunity of a lifetime. You play a flawless game and we win, you got nothin' to worry about. So do that. Don't do what I did when I had my shot and thought about everything that could go wrong. Could mean the difference between, uh, international athletic glory and coaching high school soccer and teaching science. Thank you. I appreciate that. So just be yourself tomorrow. - All right? - Okay. - And everything will be fine. - Everything will be fine. All right. I'm proud of you. You got this. National team? C, this is freakin' huge. Ava, it's time to go. Mommy's late for her microdermabrasion appointment. Okay, Mom. What do you think your mom will say about this? She'll say, um... "I am Jess Walker. Definitely a human and not a robot." "It is mathematically more favorable to give up on your dreams in favor of a boring life identical to mine." CC-Bear. Hi, honey. It's time to hit the road. The planets wait for no one. Well... Hello. I am Angelica, and I have come to town. I have just what you need for Christmas. CC, please. Get a reading during the planetary alignment. It will be magic. Ah. This family looks like it could use a little Christmas magic. She says this to every family. We should go. - Thank you so much. - Stressed out mama. - I bet you work too hard. - How does she know that, Mom? Because if she said Dad worked too hard, it would be sexist. It's not magic. It's performative liberalism. We are on borrowed time with this baby. We need to go. - We're just here for the alignment thing. - Okay. Just remember to open your hearts and view things through the lens of one another. - Yeah. - That'll give you the very thing you need. - Okay, thanks. - Bye. Come on. Oh, we're gonna grab a snack. See you in the telescope room. Wyatt, why are you trippin'? - Wow. - Come on, let me buy you ice cream. Buy me some ice cream? Well, you know I struggle with dairy. - That's because you hold it in, Mom. - Well... You just gotta let it rip. Everybody farts. - I don't. - Why would you torture yourself? Just eat some ice cream and live in your body. Yeah. Hey, why are you being so nice to me? Can't a daughter buy her mother some ice cream without raising suspicion? Not really, no. There's a scout from the national team coming to the game tomorrow, and Coach thinks I have a pretty good shot of making it. Wow. Congratulations. But if I made it, I would have to leave home next year. What about college? CC, I know how much soccer means to you. - Do you? - Trust me, I know. I wasn't much older than you. I was Junior Olympics. I know, Mom. And I'm really sorry you had to give up your career 'cause you hurt your shoulder, but this is completely different. It's not. I had to start completely from scratch. I'm just trying to protect you from that. - If you just applied yourself... - I hate when you say apply myself. Mom, we are different people. You literally just want me to be you. It's suffocating. CC. Big Yale interview tomorrow. You nervous? Very, very nervous. I'm afraid it might trigger my glossophobia. Oh, buddy, I didn't know you were scared of shiny things. It's the fear of public speaking, Dad. Right. Right. Well... Um, hey, you know what? Just pretend like it's our family holiday Christmas video. When you're with the family, you don't get so afraid. You used to crush those. There's a fearless performer in there. I know it. Right? But it does beg the question... You sure you're ready for college? Right? I mean, you're just a freshman. You still got a lot of living to do. All I know is I would do anything to be in your shoes right now. Maybe it's why you chose a career that brings you back to the source of your fond memories. Whoa. Excuse me. Well, this was fun. Mom thinks I have an easy life, but she has no idea what it's like to be me. Yeah, I can relate. Dad expects me to have the same jocular, devil-may-care high school experience that he did, but the problem is I'm not him. What did we do so wrong as parents that our two teenagers wanna leave home? Bill, this could be our last Christmas together. The alignment's about to start. Come on. Next group, please. Whoa. Take Pickles. Watch your step. - Exit to the left. - Okay. This sucks. I really didn't wanna come to this today. This is actually not about you. - This is about the family. - My white whale. It's incredible. Wyatt, I really would appreciate... ...don't care, but it means a lot to your brother, and we're a family. It's never what we wanna do... Not a care in the world. You get up, have a little Gatorade... I wish you could be me. I'd love for you to be me for one day. You wouldn't make it through lunch. You don't know how much effort I put in. I gotta think about my job. I would love for you to know what it's like to be me. - Believe it or not, I was young once. - Like 10,000 years ago? Honestly, I wanna be you. I'd kill to eat a dozen doughnuts and have it burn right off. What I wanna do is take a picture. I wanna take a picture. - Yeah, okay. - Great, picture. Okay. - What? - Would you take a picture of my family? Oh, it would be my pleasure. - CC, deliver this with a smile... - Better not post this. - ...to the nice lady. - I'd rather drink my own vomit. Thank you. So you just follow what I ask. Go up like that. Don't be naughty. Up. Up. You go to the right. You go to the left. Good. Good. Okay, Papa, suck it in. Your tummy is, you know, it's... - Put the doggy in front of it. - Okay. All right, everybody say, "Merry Christmas." Merry Christmas. Mom! Miles! Watch out! That was crazy. - Walkers, everybody okay? - Did we just break the telescope? Mom, are you kidding me? - You okay, CC? - This is so embarrassing. - Everybody, is everyone okay? - Mom, this is so embarrassing. Let's get out of here. Wyatt. Pickles. Pickles, be qu... - How'd you get past my security system? - What? - What are you doing in my bed? - You're in my bed. Wait. - Why am I in your bed, Dad? - Why am I in your bed, Mom? - Why are you calling me Mom? - Why'd you call me Dad? - Because you're Mom. - You're Dad. - Stop calling me Dad. I'm not Dad. - Stop calling me Mom. I'm not Mom. No, I'm not Mom! What is all that yelling? Bill? Bill, will you please tell... CC, I told you to clean up the balls. Either the multiverse is real, and we have passed through a sub-branching membrane of an Einstein-Rosen bridge into a parallel reality... - You don't sound like Dad, Dad. - ...or we've fallen asleep. And this is just a dream, and we have to wake up. Slap me. - Sure. - Father Christmas! - Whoa. - Very sorry, Dad. - What is happening? - That's me. CC? Mom? - What? - Mi familia. What a night. I know I'm getting old when I drink one glass of vino and I wake up in Wy-Guy's beddy-bye. Something's not right. CC? Mom? Wyatt? Dad? - CC, any luck? - No. This is a completely unique and original situation that has literally never happened before. Right? I mean, no kid has ever just woken up big. - Yeah, it's so freaky. - You're telling me. I'm 17 again. I'm 13 going on 30. We can agree that we can't go out like this. So I say we just go upstairs, listen to Nirvana, and chill. All right? Oh no, I have my Molson pitch this morning. If I'm not there, I can kiss my partnership goodbye. Oh, my Yale interview. Oh, and I have Dad or Alive practice. I can't miss that. You are not playing my game. And I am not playing like this. Well... Oh my God. Hey, remember when the planets lined up? There was a crazy flash. That's gotta be it. Right? And then when we were looking at it... You said, "You have no idea how hard my life is." "I'd love to be you." And then you said... "You'll never know what it's like to be me." We've gotta get to the telescope so we can switch back. Uh, what's wrong with Pickles? What's going on with Miles? Miles is Pickles. Pickles is Miles. Go! Pickles! Oh, Pickles. Miles! Go. Go. I think I just peed. One of the many joys of childbirth. Thank yourself for that. Wow, I feel like Spider-Man! - Where's Wyatt? - Cramps! Cramps! I think I tore a quadi. I tore both quadis. Pickles! Come back! Miles! Pickles, no! Whoa! Oh my God. Thank you, Rolf. Thank you so much. Oh, you are such a considerate neighbor. Thank you for saving my baby... I mean, my dog. Give me this. Give me my child. Give... No. - Let go. - Okay. Oh my goodness. Thank you. Perhaps a leash and a bath? Oh, my third-born child. - What would I do... - He's a special dog. - Just... - Are you in there? If it would ever please you, I would love to train your dog. The dog needs the alpha energy, which, um... Bill does not possess. - What? - Discipline. Chaos. - Okay. Thank you, Rolf. Noted. - Right. - Thank you. - Good day. Have a wonderful day, Walkers. And a leash and a bath. Oh, I literally have no pores. Ow, Mom. It hurts to be you. Whoa. Mom, check out your biscuit. Who knew you were such a big booty Judy? CC... CC Walker, you have a tattoo! At least it's a cute little owl, right? But this, we gotta cover that up. All over the face. Don't miss a spot. Just like that. Okay. - Is that... - Yeah, Wyatt, It's fine. - You're perfect. - Why am I so itchy? I'm like... All over my bod... What is... Oh, Dad, your nipples are so hairy! Oh, stop. What are you... No high school girl's ever gonna date this. Barf. - Oh, absolutely not, CC. - No. No. You cannot wear that to school. I will die. - You think you're wearing that? - You look like a doll. - Are those your father's gym shorts? No. - Is this Nancy Pelosi? - You have paint on your jacket. - You're an artist. - You should be able to dress like one. - No. I can't hope to be made partner looking like a teenybopper. You gotta bow down to the patriarchy, don't you? - Just dress for the male gaze. - Oh, you and your ideals. Let me tell you something. Ideals don't pay the bills. - Did you pluck my eyebrows? - No. Yes. Look, I think we can both agree we don't wanna ruin each other's lives today. Good luck with that, Mom. When you get home, you can change into whatever this is, but please, not for my pitch. You cannot wear this. - All right, deal. - Okay? Deal. But can you un-Martha Stewart the zing zang because... Don't give me that. All right, Walkers, let's get to the telescope and wish this back to normal. - What are you doing? - I'm gonna drive. No, you will not. You look like you're six. What are we gonna do? Uh, what? ♪ 'Cause I bundled up too tight ♪ ♪ Last minute have-to-dos ♪ ♪ A few cards, a few calls Because it's RSVP ♪ ♪ No, thanks, no party lights ♪ ♪ It's Christmas Eve, gonna relax ♪ ♪ Turn down all of my invites ♪ ♪ Merry Christmas, merry Christmas... ♪ Whoa.

You can fix all this, right? Can we fix it? Doesn't it say maintenance on my shirt? Okay. How long will it take? Well, about four or five hours of work. - Okay. - Yes. Okay. I'd say a week. Week and a half. - Does that... - Guys, I got it. All right? Don't worry. Sir, if you could have this up and running for me by tonight, I'll make it worth your while. How much cheddar we talking about, lil' player? - One second. You guys got any cheddar? - I don't have any cheese. - No. - Cheese? No, it's slang, honey.

No. I just... - I gotta squeeze it. - What... Just get in there and... - Oh no! - No. That is how things scar. Is that who I think it is? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You can't do that. You can't do that or you'll get kicked. - I... - Oh, Jess. Jess. Big day, Jess. Everybody's waiting. Don't let us down. Yes, I'll be... She'll be right there.

I need chocolate. - Note cards. Okay, note cards. Okay. Oh. Oh, yeah. So good. Cold. It's cold. It's cold. Okay, CC, look at me. I wrote the entire presentation on note cards. All you have to do is read them. I don't know anything about architecture. We're Walkers, and Walkers never quit. Not true. We always turn a movie off before it's over. All you have to do is W-A-L-K into that meeting and read them. - Be a boss. - Be a boss. - Be a boss. - Be a boss. - Be a boss. - Be a boss. - Be a boss. - Be a boss. Let's go! Whoa. Whoa. Dad, you can't just walk out there. Keep your head down. Make eye contact with no one. What? - You're about to run the gauntlet. - What's that? It's very critical that you don't stay in one place for less than four seconds or more than seven. Hey. What's up? Yo, Ruggles, what's up, man? Heck of a game last Friday. Seriously. You looked like Aaron Donald. - Thanks, bud. I froze my ass off though. - I got you. Oh, dude, I bet. - Get here. - What? - What are you doing? - I got some news here. Your dad happens to be the toast, and high school's my jam. Food metaphors have no place here, Dad. This is life and death. - I'm... - I got it. What's up, ladies? How are we? Hey! Three. Three balls! All right. No. We don't eat garbage. That's not healthy. No. Hey. Stop it. That's the water for the doggy. No doggy water. No. Nein. I'll give you your privacy. If, if you want me to take over, I can take over. Oh, there she is. Right not on time. Yeah. All right. Peter, I'd like to thank you and everyone at The Molson Group for taking time to come in today. - Start. - Love that. Our, our, our project leader and all-around superstar, Jess Walker, is gonna lead us through the presentation. Jess? Jess, we're ready. - Jess. - Go, Jess. You're gonna like it. Uh... Thank you for being here today. - Yes. - I'm gonna get started. First, I'd like to thank you for coming today. Second, I'd like to talk about this firm because here at this firm, we wanna exceed expectations. We want to combine beauty and function and innovation. Here at this firm, we have no experience building... We have experience... - Is she okay? - She's fine. Here at this firm, at Atlas... Here at Atlas... The cards. Cards. - I know, but my eyes don't work. - Glasses. Okay. Um... Okay. I got it. - I got it. - Hang on. Don't panic. Hang on. Okay, not to worry. You know what, Jess? Why don't I just jump in right here? No! I'm sorry? Really? Uh... - Sorry. Continue. - What's going on? I'm gonna talk about the building itself. - That's what matters. - Yeah. - That's what we're here for. - Yup. There's a roof and there are walls. There's a church. Here is the steeple. Open the door, see all the people. Know what? You lucky 'cause I like to laugh as much as the next person. - You do? - No, not really. - You know what? We're done. Thank you. - Peter. - Tell him to pull the car around. - No. No. Wait. Wait. I think what my mom is trying to say is that we blend form and function while using the south buttress as a tiered garden, while also supporting the central arcade. - Hm. Who's this intelligent young woman? - Oh, I'm her daughter. And any intelligence I have is purely because of the way my mother raised me. - Open that up. Let me see. - What is going on with you? I think the ice cream in the break room was expired. - I... - Ice cream in the break room? I'm lactose intolerant. That means you're lactose intolerant. It's so bad. I don't think I can hold it in. Oh, yes you can. You wanna know why? There are 40 years of farts in that stomach. You won't let them out on the most important day of my career. - I don't wanna let them out. - Just breathe. - Jess, are you all right? - I won't let them out. Jess, why don't you just continue to tell Mr. Molson about the presentation? Yeah. I've got it. Sorry. I need to... I've got it. I have to live in my body! I'm sorry! Oh my God. She's really sorry. I cannot believe my entire future just blew up right in front of me. That was in the past. We have to focus on the present. You have to play soccer for me. The account. My partnership. Why didn't you ask some of those people for help? Don't they work for you? Yes, CC, technically. But, ultimately, it is my responsibility to... Okay, whatever. Listen up. Stand on the side, run around, but if anyone passes you the ball, for the love of God, pass it right back. CC, I think I can handle that. And, Mom, whatever you do, try not to be weird with my friends. Believe it or not, I was pretty cool in high school. I'm gonna go with "or not." Hey! You got this, CC. - Kick some butt today. - Butt will be kicked. - Good luck today, CC. - Thank you. Go, CC! Go, CC! Go, CC! Everything okay, C? You seem a little stressed. Yeah. No, I'm fine. I just don't really like the roughhousing. Right. By the way, how are you liking the tattoo? - I'm getting mine this weekend. - Do not. It was a completely irresponsible and irrational decision, and I regretted it immediately. Did your mom see it? I bet she freaked. No. As a good mother should, she holds space for all her children's mistakes. That's hilarious. You sound just like her. "I am Jess Walker, mother of the century, and I hold space for all of my children's mistakes." Come on, bus is leaving. It's game time, girl. - Yes? - Hey, Rolf, it's CC. How's it going? Uh, it's a tremendous challenge, but I'll fix it. Have no fear. Rolf is here. What do you mean a tremendous challenge? It's a child and a dog. Make sure they're safe. I will apply myself that much more firmly. You don't have to be firm. Keep it together. We'll be home after the game. I must leave you now. The training continues. Ciao. Rolf. Rolf. Welcome, everybody. It's a beautiful day here at BMO Stadium. The Lucy Jones Unicorns are going up against their archrivals, the Broadwick Daredevils for the Southern California Championship. Come on, Unicorns. The Unicorns are led by their captain, CC Walker. She was All-American her freshman year and has received accolades ever since. Let's not forget about the Daredevils. They got their own secret weapons, Gisele and Alyssa Thompson, the Switchblade Sisters. But I didn't say it. Oh, this is torture. Come on, Mom. Don't let me down. I think I see Alex Sullivan. That's a scout for the US national team. Hey, girl. Oh my gosh. I'm gonna get it together. Hey, Mrs. Jenk... Hey, Carrie. Hi, Carrie. Oh my God, I love this backwards cap vibe. Very festive. Very game day. Just a little stressed today, actually. Well, guess what? Brought us a little game day vino. - Wine? - Yeah. No. I'm focused on the game, but thank you. Oh. Right, I forgot. She's a super mom. She focuses on the game. She knows all the players' names. I don't know anyone's name. Okay. Ah. You're so not prepared for this, Dad. What? I'm fine, okay? I went to college. I can do a college interview. You went to Arizona State University. This is Yale. Well, some would say that Arizona State is the Yale of Southwest Tempe. N... - Wyatt. - Yeah? I'm sorry. He... He's Wyatt. I'm a man. I'm an adult man with an adult body, adult body hair. I'm just like you. Actually, I'm Scandinavian. I'm surprisingly hairless. Is your name Wyatt? No. 'Cause I'm a man, and Wyatt is a child. This is Wyatt. Okay, then. We're ready for you. Okay, I'll be right in. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. My God, man, get a grip. What are we doing? All right? Relax, okay? Hey, when we play Jeopardy, who always wins? - Me. - Okay, yeah, well, besides you? - Mom. - Okay, well, I beat CC, don't I? - She never even watches with us. - Okay, when we watch Is It Cake? I'm always the first to guess if it's cake. - You are freakishly good at that. - Thank you. Now wish me luck, okay? Ninety minutes. Ninety minutes. Ninety minutes. And away we go. Come on, Unicorns! Come on, Unis! And her first touch is... ...literally touching the ball with her hands. She caught the ball. - She caught it. - Oh God, are you gonna be okay? He saw her catch it. What is she doing? She's hitting today. The trick is you watch it on a tablet, and then you can screengrab an image and zoom in on it. Once you see those brush marks, that's how you know it's cake. - Don't snap back. - Yeah, we don't snap. Is this, is this Flashdance? Wyatt, just as a courtesy, if you wanna start this over... Oh, please, no. - No? You wanna hit save on... - Yeah. The body language is all wrong. That is not enjoyment. That is judgment. Hey, Mr. Walker. Then Dave Grohl joined the band, and they recorded Nevermind in the spring of 1991. Ariana. - Is that Wyatt in there? - Yes. Yeah. Wyatt's in there. He's not out here. You know, I'm happy for him about Yale. It's just... I don't know. It's sad to see him go. - Yeah? You'd be sad? - Of course. I mean, we've lived a block away from each other since I was born. You know, we always used to play together as kids. We even had this Christmas teddy bear thing we used to pass around each year. - You remember that? - Of course I do. He's such a kind and thoughtful guy, and honestly, there's so few of them. He's really tough. He does karate. Yeah. He's got two stripes on his white belt. Should be a yellow belt. His sensei said he cried during his test, which is insane 'cause he almost never cries in real life. - Get it to CC! - Oh my gosh. Girl. Okay, remember I told you that John and I were having a little issue? I tried that crazy thing you told me about from college. It worked. I went... Walker gets sliced and diced by the Switchblade Sisters! It's a red card! Cut her from behind. You saw that, right? - You saw that? - Yeah. Can't imagine the national scout is pleased with this performance. - Pass me some of that wine? - Absolutely. Oh. We would be remiss if we didn't talk about the very exciting work that you appear to be doing with the Riemann hypothesis. Solved it. - One of Hilbert's 23 unsolved problems? - Yeah, tell Hillbilly he's down to 22. Okay, Hillbilly has been dead for 80 years. As someone who has wrestled with Riemann, I'm curious, which way are you leaning? True or false? False. - Ira. - Suck a duck. Take a breath. The Clay Institute offers a $1 million prize to anyone who can solve Riemann. We would love if you could show some of your work here right now. Thrilled. Um... Ree-man? I thought you said Redman. I solved his hypothesis. - The Redman hypothesis? - Redman hypothesis? From Wu-Tang? Come on. CC Walker sleeping as that ball rolled right between her legs. The Daredevils with a one-zero lead. Oh, this is torture. You are ruining my life! When parents yell from the sidelines, it puts pressure on the kids. She popped out three kids, and she works 60 hours a week. I think she can handle a little bit of constructive criticism! I gotta get outta here. I gotta get outta here. That's my girl. CC, I'm coming. - Looks like we have a helicopter mom. - Excuse me! Black Hawk down. Is that a Minecraft sticker on your bottle? - Yeah, I love Minecraft. - You do? - Yeah. - What about Dune? Wanna talk about the original or the new one? - I actually wanna talk about the novel. - Frank Herbert is my favorite author. - What? - Mm-hmm. Any chance you're a vegetarian who's open to cloned meats? Obviously. Obviously. Right? It's the only ethical, sensible way to be. - How do you feel about cyborgs? - Robots kinda freak me out. - Sure, totally. Robots are stupid. - No. Hey, you think Wyatt might wanna go to Hunter's party? - Hunter Drew is having a party? - Mm-hmm. Maybe I'll be able to hang out with him. I think he might be there. All right, cool. See you, Mr. Walker. Bye. Don't, don't stand up on the chair. What? - Push up. - Push up. Mrs. Walker. Sorry. Hustle! - Pass and move. - Pass and move. Come on! Seriously, I got this. - Jeez. - Sorry. Watch out for that sweeper! Take the shot! - Goal! - Goal! Okay, Mrs. Walker, I appreciate the enthusiasm, but parents are not allowed down here. Ever since that lawsuit. - You know this. - Sorry. Come on, let's huddle up. Come on. Bring it in. All right. You guys can't hear this. Get away. Get away. You're giving me everything. I want more. Put pressure. We gotta play our game... Excuse me. I think we gotta switch from a 4-4-2 to a 4-3-3. You need the extra attacker out there if we're gonna generate any scoring opportunities. - Let me have that board. - That's mine. That's my board. When you get that outer pass from Ava, I want the attackers upfield. They're gonna overcompensate, and that'll be wide open. This is what we've waited for since kindergarten. What? - Team on three. - Team on three. - One, two, three, team. - Team! They've switched from a 4-4-2 to a 4-3-3. Someone give CC the ball. - She's ready. She's open. - Pass it. There's a lob passed to CC Walker. She's wide open. - She's got it! - Come on! Let's go! - Let's go! - CC, get it! - A chance for the game-winning goal. - You got it, CC! You got it! You can't just... Put it in, CC! Do it! Do it, Mama! Do it! What are you doing, Mama! What's she doing? - You okay? - No. What is she doing? I believe she's helping the opposing player. Here, I'll help you. You know, CC Walker's hopes for the national team dashed right in front of us. Pretty sad day. Tell you that much. CC, I said I was sorry. Well, you always said soccer doesn't make a real career. Thanks to you, it never will be. Honey, there will be other chances at the national team. You don't get it because you don't really care about me and about what actually makes me happy. You just want me to be like you and think like you and act like you. It's not about the national team. I just wanna get away from you. Nein. Aus. Aus. Stuck. Drop it. What? What, wha... What do you want? You want me to put this diaper on you? If you understand me, bark twice. Wow. Super. You're fine. He asked me to do this. Listen, I think the dog and the baby are spending too much time together. All right, time to put this day behind us and switch back. Oh, it looks great. Fire it up. Let's get this show on the road. Unfortunately, the old girl still ain't up and running. Excuse me? We put the telescope back together, but we can't find the fifth lens. It's no bigger than a quarter. Damnedest thing. - We looked everywhere for it. It's gone. - Let's get a new one. Dad, it's an achromatic field lens with a double convex eye. The lens is comprised of thorium oxide. Which has a similar crystalline structure to calcium fluoride. With optical properties of high refractivity. And low dispersion... To minimize chromatic aberration. Is that something we can get at LensCrafters or... Hell no, you can't pick it up at LensCrafters. - They're handmade in Switzerland. - Lausanne, to be exact. And the alignment only lasts for one more day. You'll catch the next one. Very funny. Why is that funny? Because the next alignment is in 2162. Hey, my favorite family. Has everybody found the Christmas spirit? Definitely not. Well, maybe some Christmas caroling will help bring it out. - It always helps me. - No. We're in a crisis. Are you serious? It sounds like you need to fix what is broken. Yeah, we have to fix the telescope, but we have to find a very specialized, specific lens... Spock! It, it's a long shot, but he owes me, and SpaceX probably has the tech to fabricate the lens we need. - Right. - Yes. I'll call that Lyft. - Guess what? - You're a Lyft driver too? Come on.

What's going on? I was talking to Ariana earlier, and, um, she invited me, well, you, to a party at Hunter Drew's house, and I just was really hoping to have my body back so I could... I don't like parties. - No. - Yes. - No. - Yes. Come on. For Wyatt. Why is everything blurry up close? I don't... Ugh. What is it, like midnight? I'm exhausted. It's, like, 7:45. This is kind of exciting, right? Is it bad to say that this is the most exciting thing I've done in years? Jimmy, jump! Jimmy! Should we call his mother? I'm sure Jimmy's fine. - Party on. - I don't think Jimmy's moving. What are you doing?

I just don't want you messing this up for Wyatt. I got it. I'll be fine, all right? Just relax. Hey. Jitters. - Hi, Ariana. - Hi, CC. You okay? I heard you had a stroke at your soccer game. Oh... - You're fine? - Really good. You look like you got dressed at a Goodwill. You're not fine. Hi. Sorry to interrupt. I need to speak with my wife/spouse person right now in the kitchen. - Gotta go. - Wife person? We've never been hotter. You don't even know, it's just "passion" passion. Passion? You know, my intimacy doula, Blaze, says that couples need a minimum of 12 kisses a day just to sustain a relationship Blaze has recently been working with Harry and Meghan. We've already kissed all day. We've kissed like 14 times. - I don't think so. - Yeah. - Why don't you guys give a kiss? - What is going on? I think they're on to us. - What? - Yeah. - No, I've been gone for two minutes. - I know. I think we have to kiss. Never doin' that. - Please, little mouth-to-mouth CPR. - Come on. You have to kiss me. Just do it. Wyatt. Wyatt! - Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! - Save your marriage. They're like a pack of wolves. - You have to do it. - I don't wanna do it. - We don't have a choice. - Ew. I'm so sorry, Wyatt. Just be a man. Just do it fast. Just do it. Do it. - Fight for your love. - Less talking, more kissing. - Come on. - Let's see it. It's healthy. Do it. No. - Oh gosh. - He looks like an iguana. - They're kissing. - Oh my gosh. We have to ta... We have to talk in the kitchen. I wanna make out with him so bad. - You want some? - Oh no, please, no. Especially not after six, no. Between the colonoscopy and the polyps, it's just a lot on my, on my heart. - I'm so sorry. - We got bigger problems. - Mom and Dad are gone. - What'd you mean? They can't be gone. I don't know. They're gone. What are we gonna do? First thing is to get rid of these crazy moms. They're here for Mom's monthly supper club. Okay, so if we give them food, they'll leave. Yeah. We'll make 'em something. Mom does it. I've observed Mom making dinner thousands of times. How hard can it be? - I'll get the chicken. - I'll get the fixings. Hey, girls. Are we doin' it for the 'gram? Whoa! Oh my God! - Wait a minute! - I'm getting some water! What...

It's essentially an architectural problem. We're solving for a curvature equation using differential geometry. But what's the vector analysis? Where are the planar quadrilaterals? And we must calculate for the cross-structural integrals. - You know, guys, math is art. - Seriously? Just look at the quadrature of Notre Dame, or even the Golden Ratio of the Parthenon.

You're my boss, and you're my role model, and I'd be thrilled if I could manage to balance work and family even as half as well as you can. But you've taught me it comes with sacrifices. What sacrifices? I mean, not like sacrifices because they're for your kids, and apparently, they're important. I wouldn't know. I have hamsters. But, like, sacrifices.

I will be okay 'cause I have the best mom in the world, and that's how she raised me. - Mom... - Hm.

We passed on a synchronized swim band for this. - Dad. - Bill. - We got here quickly. - Where's Wyatt? I've looked everywhere. I'm worried. - Let's go find him. - We want the show! - Wyatt! - Wyatt, where are you, son? Come on, dude. You're freaking us out. I'll check the science wing. You get east and west corridors. - Okay. - Okay. Hey, Wyatt. Wyatt. - God. - Hey, Dad. Wyatt? What are you doing, man? Wipe it up. We gotta go on stage. I really wish I could. I just... I can't. I'm not like you, Dad. I'm sorry. What are you sorry for? I heard these kids talking about how you were in a band that went on to be huge, but you had to settle for being my dad. I may have been in a band that went on to become a huge success. But so what? Well, which band was it? Maroon 6. Isn't it Maroon 5? Yeah. - No way. - Yeah. Whoa. Do I miss it sometimes? Yeah. I mean, it's hard to accept that your glory days are behind you, but would I trade what I have now for anything? No way. Being your dad has been the rock 'n' roll adventure of a lifetime. Come here. Love you, buddy. I love you, Dad. - Wyatt. You okay? - Um... Well, uh, I'm not doing the show, and I'm pretty sure Yale is not gonna be callin'. Yeah, and Dad or Alive is no longer living. So... If it makes you feel better, I think my dreams of playing for the national soccer team are pretty much shot. Yeah, and I think I can say I no longer work at Atlas. I haven't heard anything from Spock about the lens. So... Wait, tell me that it's for the family Christmas videos. What do you mean? When I'm with you guys, I'm not afraid. It's just like when we were kids. It's just us. - Yeah, we'll all be right there. - Right behind you. Okay. Okay. - Go. Go.

Dad or Alive. I was not expecting that. Dad or Alive, you're going to Hollywood! I'm proud of you, son. You did it! You did it! Good job! Good job! Jess! Jess! Oh my God. Amazing! - Mr. Molson, I can explain, sir. - There's no need. - Kara insisted I tell you in person. - I did. Your team delivered that pitch perfectly. I'm awarding you the Jefferson Gardens project. - Congratulations. - We got it? - We got it! - Oh my God! Way to go, partner. Partner? What about me? - You're fired. - Ho, ho, ho. - Thank you, sir. Thank you. - No problem. - Wyatt. - I'm Wyatt. There's been a ripple in the space-time continuum, or a glitch in the simulation. I'm in my father's body. - Makes sense. - You have the lens? Well, depends. You still got that Charizard you told me about? My first edition PSA-rated 10 holo Charizard card? - How dare you. - Oh, I dare. That's my prized possession. More prized than your own body? - Take it. - I'll take it. Nice doing business with ya. - We got the lens. - We got it. - We got the lens? - Yeah. How long until the planets fall out of alignment? Thirty-seven minutes. To get across town? We'll need a rocket ship. You asked for a rocket ship, I give you a '69 Yenko Camaro. Mom, we need Pickles and Miles. Wait, who's gonna drive? Look, we'll do it together, okay? Okay, kiddo, I got shifting and steering. You got the gas, the brake, and the clutch. - What's the clutch? - It's the other pedal. - There's three pedals? - This is your plan? - Didn't say it was a good one. - Hit it. Phew. Okay, rough start. But we're learning, all right? Here we go. - Okay. - When I say gas it, you just... - Which way do we take? - Take the 110 to the 101. No. The game's just ended. Downtown will be a parking lot. Well, then what? We get off at Western and go up through Koreatown into Little Armenia. Look, we just need to get to the 101 North. No. Harry Styles had a concert at the Hollywood Bowl. Man, that'll be a One Direction nightmare, huh? - Not the time, Dad. - Yeah, sorry. How about we take the 10 to the 110 to the 101 South to the five, get off at Los Feliz? That's a very strange route. Somebody make a decision. There won't be a decision. There's gridlock on the bridge. Guys, we're not gonna make it. We are gonna make it because Walkers never quit. Go left! - Watch out! - I got this. This is not a video game! Feels like one! Whoa. - The lens! The lens bounced out! - It's on the hood! It's on the hood! I am getting that lens. Watch out for my big booty Judy! Careful! Hold on! I am getting it! - Hurry up! - Don't let go! - Get back! - I got it! Wyatt! Oh, man, my door. Good news. Car still looks pretty cheery on this side. Shall we? Let's go, Walkers! We're gonna make it. What... Angelica? What are you doing here? I think you need a little Christmas miracle. Get in. Okay. - We have it. Go. Go. - Whoa! No. No. No. It's not your fault. Not now, Miles or Pickles or whoever you are. - What's that in his mouth? - What do you got? It's the original lens. He must've picked it up and put it in the pocket. - We still have ten seconds. - I love you, you little magpie. - Go! - Go! Come on. Come on. Wyatt, go. - Okay. We're good. - You did it. Everybody wish you were back in your original bodies. Everybody say, "Merry Christmas." - Mom? - You're me. You're me. I don't understand. I feel the same. Yeah, me too. It didn't work.

Yale says I'm not ready yet. Ariana, hi. Hey. Merry Christmas. Mr. Mistletoe. That's just to keep you company when you're gone. I'm actually not leaving. But it's okay 'cause these last couple of days, I've really had the time to realize what's important. And Yale's not going anywhere. I feel like if I leave now, I'll miss out on way too much. Like what? Well, sharing Mr. Mistletoe with you. You kiddin' me? That's how you know it's cake. - So Minecraft later? - Yeah, of course. All right, we'll go on my server. Yours is a little cluttered. It's not. Excuse me. Is this CC Walker's house? Yeah. I, I'll grab her right now. Thank you. CC, Alex Sullivan from the US National Team. Yeah. Mr. Sullivan, I know who you are. My flight got delayed because of this snowstorm, so I thought I'd come in person and give you the news. We'd like to officially give you another chance. Really? Even after that horrible game? We're looking for two things in our players. Good soccer. Good character. I've seen your tapes. I knew you were a great soccer player. But when I saw you give up a game-winning goal to help an injured opponent, I knew you had both. Oh my gosh. Can you hold on for one second? Hey, Mom? It's a miracle. This is the rep from the national team. He just offered me another chance. But I'm, I'm saying no, right? Wait. No. - Right. I'm so sorry... - Wait, no, we're saying yes. You have to say yes. And look, if soccer is the thing you love, I'll be at every game. Really? Yeah. Try and stop me. Thank you! Okay, I have no idea what... - Yes! - Yes! Great. - This is yours. - Hey, guys! Thank you. - See you at the tryouts. - Thank you so much. Merry Christmas. - What? - Oh my God.
