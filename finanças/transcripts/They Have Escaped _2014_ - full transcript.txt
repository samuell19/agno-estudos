I'm Jarkko Voikkaala, the director of the children's home. J...J... J... That's right; You have that... Alright, Joni, welcome. Doing your alternative military service here includes - a number of responsibilities. I'll explain them in detail when I show you around. You'll have to fill out a bunch of documents, - confidentiality agreements and such. The animals are here. The kids can take care of them. Girls' side. Boys' side. We'll go into the girls' side. Today is cleaning day. You'll see what's going on in our residents' lives. We'll go through their stuff but leave them where they are. Don't stick your hand into a drawer without checking it first. You might find a nasty surprise. Fuck. We confiscate matches, lighters - and anything that can be used as a weapon. We have zero tolerance for alcohol, cigarettes and tobacco. We throw all suspicious, stinky trash away - and find out what's going on in the children's lives. It's of the utmost importance that we can anticipate everything. You're not allowed to make friends with the children - or hang out with them. A lot of them come from a rough background. They'll bullshit you and lie to your face. You have to understand - that they're not here of their own free will. This is society's way of making sure - that they stay out of trouble. Your job is to be a role model for them, - a stable, normal young man. You have bars on the windows, since we never know - when we'll need the room for one of our residents. Is that all your stuff? Here you go. One more thing. We know you went AWOL from your military service. You can't run away from here, or you'll do your service in prison - or under house arrest, wearing an ankle monitor. I'm sure you understand. Alright then. Welcome. Make sure you're on time for work. SHOPPING LIST 10 liters of milk, 20 eggs, bread Raisa, get back here! - We'll talk about this... - You can't be fuckin' serious! It was a non-alcoholic cider, you bloody fucking asshole! - You know we have zero tolerance... - Stop whining about it! I have to confiscate it. - Let me go! - Get out, okay? - Let me go! - Get out. Close the door. Hi, I'm Vera. What's your name? - J... J... Joni. - What? - J... J... - What? - J... J... Joni. - Nice to meet you, J... J... Joni. - Learn to talk, idiot. - Why didn't you go into the army'? - I w... was... - You're a wuss? He's probably a faggot. He got a hard-on when he showered with the guys. Or he's a pedophile who's going to rape us. - Jerk! - Stutter more. Fuck off! You don't belong here. You fuckin' clown. Get a life. Children! Quiet! Now! You know how to behave. - Jerkoff. - Suck my dick. This is no way to welcome someone here. You almost killed us. Keep your eyes on the road, stupid! Help rne. Stop. I'll get out here. Come here. Come on, quick. Don't tell on me. Or I'll tell on you. She's seventeen. She ran away, - but I'm sure she'll be back - pretty soon. Let me ask him. Did you see Raisa? Joni! Did you see Raisa, the girl with the white hair? He didn't know much. I'm sure you noticed there was a police car here earlier. Raisa took a little vacay, - went to the village and stole cigarettes. So she has cigarettes now? Raises privileges are restricted for the time being. You're not allowed to have contact with her. No knocking on the window, no notes slipped under the door - and no whispering behind the door. Fuck, I'll leave for good. Guess what? When I was little, I found a treasure in a snow bank. Shitloads of money. In a plastic bag. I hid the money and I still have it. It's in a safe place. I just have to go get it. There's so much money - that I could take a trip to a desert island far away. Or where the Formula One drivers live, you know. Or somewhere. I don't give a fuck. I'll fuckin' run away. S...should we take the car? Yeah, let's take the car. Where are we going? L...L... Let's go get the t... treasure. I... I still have one. You can have it. Stop the car! - W... What? - I have to get out. - W... Why... - I have to take a piss! None of your business. And why did you brake like that? I almost pissed myself. You have a light? O...our car is over there. Let me have the last drag. I remembered in the woods that I should go to this one place. I have to go see my grandma. She lives in a nursing home nearby. She had a stroke. She can't speak, and one side of her body is paralyzed. But she understands everything, and she can nod and shake her head. I haven't seen her in a long time. I can't remember. I remember the traffic circle that we passed. Then we have to drive about ten kilometers. - Then there's supposed to be a big baboon. - A b... b... A big fuckin' monkey that had a beer can in his hand. It was on the side of the road. You have to turn after it, and the nursing home is right there. But it wasn't in some fuckin' woods. An evening snack. Joni. Why did you run away from the army? Sh... Sh... Sh... Shitty food. Shitty food. You're funny. I'll get some sleep now. Good night, sleep tight. Joni, wake up. Someone's walking around the car. There's someone out there. Let's go. Just drive. - There's no one. - I drove by this morning... Go! Start the car! - Go, for fuck's sake! - Is everything alright, kids? Just drive! Fuckin' go! Yay, we escaped! Joni, you're my hero. - Hi. - Hi. You like school? Yeah. Sometimes it's fun; Sometimes it's not. Are you bullied? You have to hit the bully. Hit him so hard he'll hurt like hell. Stab him in the face with a pencil. He'll get scared of you and stop bullying. Dad, customer! Is she bothering you? What would you like? Two Fortunato family size pizzas. To go. My dad will pay. He's looking for a parking space. I'm ordering now to save time. Hi. What would you like? Two euros to use the toilet. It's free for customers. I see. You have change if I pay with a five-hundred-euro bill? I'll go get change. Wait here, okay? I don't believe this. Give me a blowjob. Raisa. - Why did you park here? - I've been here the whole time. - I told you to keep the car running. - We're running out of gas. There's not enough to get you home. For fuck's sake, Joni. Let's get QOinQ- Chicken. Raisa? Raisa. - Give it to me. - Which one? That one. This boy once chased me and I ran really hard - and climbed that fence, even though I was just a little kid. Go. Go. They moved. Did you hear if it rang? L...I'm not sure. - Oh, it's you. - Hi. - Dad and I heard the doorbell. - It was me. I opened the front door, but there was no one. - We came around back. - Who's he? - He's Joni. - Oh. - What's going on? - I need to get something... Social services and the police called us. Yeah, but I just need to get this one thing from my stuff. Then I'll leave. Please take your shoes off and leave them outside. Excuse me. Come downstairs. - Hi, Dad. - Hi. All your things should be in these boxes. We haven't touched anything since the move. Mom, you know where my jewelry box is? - The one with the angel on the side? - I can't remember. Everything should be here. You just have to go through the boxes. I'll go upstairs. It's a red box. Mom. Mom. Mom! He's sleeping. - What is it? - I can't find the jewelry box. It should be there somewhere. You sure? There's a picture of an angel on the side. It's made of wood. About this big. I'm not sure. We did put all your stuff there, though. Just go back and look again. There's something really important in it. Are you sure you haven't thrown it away? Mom, can you come help me? I don't think we would've thrown anything important away. Go look again. Morn. I was thinking of going to see Grandma. That's a nice thought. Yeah, but I couldn't remember where the nursing home was - and we got lost and had to sleep in the woods in the car. But I could go see her on our way back. Right... Go look again; Everything should be down there. Just go and look some more. It should be here somewhere. Come on! The cops are here! This way. Fuck. I didn't bullshit you, you know. The treasure story is true. Believe me. You believe me? Yeah. Good. I'm hungry- Joni, step on the gas! - R... R... Raisa? - Yeah? I... I have an idea. Let's go b... back. - Back to the children's home? - No. I can't. I... I went AWOL. I'll end up in p... prison. - Where do you want to go then? - B... back to the island. Raisa, I... let's go back to the island and s... s... Joni. A...and steal everything we can. Howdy. Where are you going? Don't you have shoes? Hi, this is Junnu Lahtinen from Directum Business. Oh, I caught you at a bad time. This is Junnu Lahtinen. Howdy. How's it going? This is Junnu Lahtinen. Howdy. From Directum Business. Yeah. I should start going to the gym. Wait here. It won't take long. A couple of jokes about gypsies and that's it. Well, what do you think? Shit. - So you're gonna go sell your stuff to the Nazis. - Yeah. You have to believe in people. Sure you know how to start this? - Or we can steal the keys from him. Let's take the car. - No. I can't stand the way he talks. I heard him in my sleep. "Oh yes. Oh yes. Oh yes." I'm fuckin' bored. Soon I'll probably get bored of you, too. I didn't mean it. Dunno... I'm just so tired of everything. Everything goes wrong. It's not your fault. Why did you even bother to come with me? Well... I... I... love you. You can't say that. No one has ever loved me, and I don't love anybody. Get it? He's back. My joke worked. They bought the stuff. I got shoes for you, so you don't have to walk around in your socks. Oh yeah. Food in these places is better than people think. That's not a frozen dinner; İt's a home-made meal. You can taste the difference. But people think they know better. They think they know. But they don't know. They always think they're being screwed. In my work as a salesman, - everything is based on building trust. You have to stand behind your words. You can't bullshit people. Or you'll lose customers. This is about something else. You have to know human nature. I mean, I wouldn't start selling you any financial assistance. What? You want dessert? Ice cream? Stop! Make a U-turn! It's the beer monkey! That's the baboon. The beer monkey! Where are we going? Straight ahead. To see my grandma. Let's go. I feel weird leaving you guys here in the middle of the woods. I'm going to a friend's cottage 100 kilometers from here. - You could go to the sauna and eat... - No thanks. That's alright. You got your plans. Here's my card. Call me if you need a ride back down south. Take care. Adios. PRIVATE PROPERTY Stop. Raisa. Raisa. Raisa. Raisa! Raisa! You don't have to say anything yet.
