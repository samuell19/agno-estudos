The Third Eye There she is. She's coming. Marta no matter who it is, I don't want to be disturbed. Do you understand... absolutely no one. You can't ignore some things. I don't ignore anything. Concerning that one... the less I see of her, the better. Why don't you acknowledge their plans to marry? The wedding is still far away... really... very far away. That's not true. It'll be here in a short month. Marta! Hi, Mino. What's wrong? Why? Well, you're making such a face. I've been waiting two hours. Where have you been? On the hillside. I wanted to pick a bouquet for your mother. And that took you so long? Today is the day you leave There are more important things to do than pick flowers for mother. Just impossible. Mino... are you serious? Sometimes I just don't know... Instead... just tell me the truth about where you were. You know... Laura. Marta" where is the Countess? The Madam Countess does not wish to be disturbed. As she wishes. Would you give her these flowers from me. Laura-- Laura. Forgive me, Laura. I'm sorry for my bad behavior. But I am torn apart by your pending absence. It's only for a few days. You know that. Our room is almost ready. Don't you want to see it? No. I'm tired. I'd rather take a bath before I leave. Just for a moment. Please. You're like a child. You can't deal with rejection. Alright, just for a moment. Stop, Mino. Please. I feel like someone is watching us. Laura... what strange ideas you have. I should be happy, but something is very wrong. Laura-- Are you there? When she entered the house, she seemed very nervous. Apparently they had another fight. If they were fighting... they've already made up. Or they will any minute. Leave that alone. Don't get involved These things don't concern you. Pay more attention to your housework... ...instead of snooping around like you do The house is falling apart and you stand around daydreaming. I dream the day away? I'm up every morning at 5 AM and I never take a break. You'll never find another who works as hard as me. Luckily, I'll have one less bed to worry about soon. I mean this one here. After the wedding, you won't be sleeping in the same room. And I'm sure the wedding bed will be made by the little wife. My God. I don't even want to think about it. Sometimes I watch him all night long and I think... How will I ever have the courage to stand it. No. This girl? No. I would give anything for someone to free me from Laura. Do you really want that? Well, perhaps a nice accident. There are many things we need to discuss in detail. Things you should tell me. Like the way your mother treats me. No... don't do that right now. Also... the animosity of that house girl. I'm uncomfortable living with you in this house. Stop. You're like all the others. No. Don't say that. That's not true. And you know it well. Excuse me, I have a headache. I need some fresh air. Alright then. We'll see each other later. Mino... What do you want? Come here to me. Look me in the eyes. You're acting so strange. There's nothing wrong. You're lying to me. You're lying to your mother. You used to be open and honest... you always trusted me. We were so close... you and I. Then she came along and separated us. What are you saying? No, mother. That's not true. You must believe me. I swear. I'm dedicated to you. You only need to talk to me... then everything will be alright. I want to hear you say it. "I'm leaving this girl". "The relationship is over." No. No. - Mino... - Not that. I don't want to, Mino. What are you doing here? I'm cleaning the laboratory. Go tend to Miss Laura... she probably needs you. The Count suggested my help. No, I don't need you. Thank you. I'm sure a massage would be good for you. This valley is damp and not good for delicate constitutions. ...like yours... for example. - Do you feel better now? - Yes, that's enough, thank you. Give that to me. I'll wash your back. Are you a member of the family? I was born here. My father was the right-hand of the deceased Count. He practically ran the entire estate. At that time, it was a lucrative farm. We had 15 employees. Count Alberto spent most of his time with my father. He was the only person the Count trusted. They died together in a hunting accident. Since that day, the Countess and her son became inseparable. I see... they became inseparable. But I know... no one will come between Mino and myself. That's enough... Not even his mother. I would bet on that if I were you. What? The Count is devoted to his mother He would never betray her. He'd rather avoid a relationship with another woman. Don't exaggerate so, Marta. Why are you telling me this?... Tell the Countess and my fiance I am leaving immediately. Alright... if that's your wish. I have decided to leave earlier than I originally expected. The road is dangerous with curves... And I'd rather drive in the daylight. Excuse me, Countess... but I won't be sharing dinner tonight. But of course, Laura. As you wish. I'd like to get home by 6. My sister is coming back from school in Switzerland. It's been six months since we've seen each other. And I must be there. Yes... In the past, when a servant wanted to leave early... They would say. "My mother has taken sick". Servants now-a-days claim to have sisters from Swiss schools. But... But Countess... Don't think twice about it. Sometimes I don't even know what I'm saying. But the next time... I'll know even better. I wish you a good trip. Thank you. And thanks for your warm hospitality, Countess. Don't mention it. Please, could I... The Count is not here. He went to the city. The Count won't return until this evening. That doesn't matter. Tell him I'll call him tomorrow. Countess... - Can I take your luggage to the car? - No, thank you. Come in. Dinner is ready, Mr Count. Thank you. Has Miss Laura come downstairs yet? The madam left ten minutes ago. What? She seemed to be in a hurry. And why? Why didn't you tell me? Stand still Where are you going? What did you do to Laura? You mistreated her... Mino! I forbid you to speak to me like that. Do you understand? Mino! Is that what you wanted? Is that what you hoped for? You are crazy. Yes, I am crazy. You will try anything to get involved with this family You are even chasing after my son. You're the crazy one How long do you think you will control him?... He wants to have a woman beside him... a real woman And you won't be able to keep that from him. Is this the thanks I get for raising you as my daughter? Your daughter? You treated me like your slave for years. Leave this house immediately I'll give you ten minutes to pack all your things And then get out. Forgive me, please. Let go of me. Just get out. Let go. Damn witch! Let go! Laura! No. No. No! Nooo--- --it can't be true. She was like a mother to me. Excuse me, but the poor Countess had a fatal accident. -No- You can't go in there now... the investigation is under way. Sit down, please. Armani-- Has the son arrived? -Yes- Was he informed? -Yes- Excuse me, Count... I need to speak with you Pull yourself together, Count. You must be strong now Death by accident. -I'll await the official report- Marta" Marta-- Listen to me You must pull yourself together The Count is overcome by his great loss He needs you now... You must stand by his side Understand? Right by his side. Yes. I know. From now on... I don't want to see these birds anymore. Nobody may go inside there. Nobody. Mino-- Mino-- What's happening?... What's wrong with you? Tell me. Are you feeling better now? Are you? Is it better? Yes. Yes. And now-- we gladly present the International dance star... Maria Margot. Make yourself at home. Tell me, my clear... am I going to receive a nice little gift? I'm ready... can I join you in your room? Where are you? Darling? Do you delight in scaring me? Let's go. This looks like a butcher's room Isn't there a more appropriate room we can use? Get undressed. Hurry up. Undress. You know, you may find this odd- - but now I feel like I should be ashamed of myself. C'mon, get undressed! Aren't you ashamed? Hey-- what's wrong with you? Laura. And now her... Why did you kill her? I don't know. I didn't want to do it I didn't want to do it. - I'm going to call the police. - No. What should I do then? I don't know. I don't know. Please help me. But how? We need to get rid of her. I guess-- we should bury her. No-- that's far too dangerous We must make the corpses disappear completely. How is that possible? In the laboratory-- with hydrochloric acid. Show us what you can do. Fly now. Fly now. Stupid parrot. Do it. Don't be so stupid. Careful... alright--- No. No. No. Fly now. Fly now. Do it. To proud, to beautiful What are you doing? Going out? You should... it'd be good for you You need to distract yourself. It's not easy. I've tried without success. I know-- it's almost impossible But keep trying. -Maybe- What kind of game is he playing? Hello, sir-- How would you like me? yes or no I don't have time to waste, understand? What's your name? Loradonnna Now what should I do? Get in or look for someone else? Get in. How old are you? Why do you care? Are you a cop? What did you say? Maybe you're one of those undercover cops But no... after seeing you now ...you're not that type But I bet you're the kind who likes to take control Am I right? More-or-less. This can't be true This is more money than I've ever seen in my life Big wonderful bills It's not counterfeit, is it?... You don't belong to a band of counterfeiters, do you? Tell me-- what do you want to do? The same as everyone. Marta-- Did you see? I have killed again. I killed again. It's as though I suddenly had a third eye The third eye It always stares in the same direction Help me, Marta. Help me. Help you? It's easy: what? You think it's easy? But this time you didn't calculate correctly I'm finished. Marta! Marta" tell me it's not true Tell me you're not leaving I beg you, Marta. Listen to me. No. No, Mino You listen to me now Since I was brought into the world, I only took orders I worked like a slave I also grew up in this house I too lived within these walls And-- And-- I saw wealth around me, out of my reach I was no more than an employee to all of you But that's over now... Now... Now you must come to grips with life on your own. You can't go now, Marta... don't leave me Ask anything from me... but, please don't leave. What I want... That's what you said Say it again. Yes... whatever you want. I will stay, Mino ...under one condition. Yes. Yes. I want to be your wife. My wife? You are sick, Mino... and you know it You also know there is no cure It would be deception no to realize that You will always need new sacrifices Only a woman who shares everything with you... Can understand you... and will be able to help you I will be an understanding wife to you For better and for worse What do you say? Agreed. Just as you wish. Wait here for me. Excuse me, is this Villa Alberti? I am Daniela Campi, Laura's sister You knew her, didn't you? Yes, of course You look exactly like her. Yes I know. I imagine you'd like to speak with the Count. Yes-- is he at home? No. He's not in. He drove into the city. Perhaps I could wait. There's no point in that He won't return today Sometimes he stays two or three days in the city Can I give him a message? -Thank you. Ask him---- Laura--- Hello, Mino. Do you remember me?... I am Daniela. Little Daniela We haven't seen each other in such a long time Certainly I have changed a lot. You have become a beautiful young woman What brings you here? I still haven't given up hope of finding Laura's body Tomorrow two divers are making another attempt And I want to be there For you... her corpse probably has no meaning... But for me... it does I want Laura to find peace in a quiet, safe place ...not on the bottom of a gray sea I think it's time to return to my hotel. I will forbid you to stay anywhere besides my home. The villa has enough room. Marta" prepare a room for the lady. Thank you Mino... I accept your gracious hospitality And now, I am lucky to be closer to Laura than I expected I'm very pleased. Your hospitality is wonderful Listen to me, Mino I want to tell you something confidentially. What is it? Tell me. I've always dreamed of dining with a man like you In a villa exactly like this Next to a fireplace... by candlelight And whatever else fills the scenario - Only. - Only? In my dreams I was wearing a luxurious evening dress And the entire scene took place at the turn of the century ...not in this banal year of 1968. Why are you laughing? It's very strange But since you came into this house You have made me see my entire life in the future's mirror. Even though I don't prefer it... I've been living in the past. There is always a meeting point between the future and the past. That is---? The present. You are dismissed, Marta... I don't need you anymore. It would be better if I retired as well... The trip was very tiring Tomorrow we will have plenty of time We'll get to know each other better. Daniella-- What is it? Nothing... Goodnight. Good night. Mino-- what is the meaning of all this? What liberties you are taking Your tone of voice is too familiar... A familiarity which you have not yet earned Yes-- I think I must blame it on my mother. On your mother? Yes, Marta We gave you too many liberties resulting in you crossing the line I will inform my mother of your insubordination. But not today... because today is a day of celebration Because tomorrow is my wedding. Do you think I'd ever let you marry? But of course There's so much to do... you know Miss Laura is back. Laura? And this time mother can say whatever she wants But tomorrow morning I will marry Laura. Mino-- what are you saying? What are you talking about?... Your mother has been dead for a year And Laura is also dead... We are the only two left Only the two of us alone. Get lost. You are crazy Get out of my house. Go away. Out of here Out of here. Out of here. Get lost Immediately. Crazy. Liar Liar! Liar! Liar! Liar. Liar. Help me. Help. How stupid you are. You wanted to kill her That was--- That was a big mistake. You shouldn't have done that Why did you want to kill ...kill her? Why are you attracted to her... you don't even know her Please... I'm the best for you Don't move. Where are we going? Why-- why aren't you wearing the white dress? What white dress? I don't have a white dress. I love white more than any other color It reminds me of newly fallen snow Before anyone disturbs it It's beautiful. And so virginal. I must ask you... what happened to my sister? You should have worn it... You look beautiful in white... Laura. What did you say? You look best in white The wedding? What are you talking about? No! No! Oh God! You know, Laura... I always knew you'd come back You understand... you mean everything to me. Even she-- even she knew it That's why she tried to keep us apart But she didn't succeed. How much? -Fill it up- Alright. Your keys. -How much?- 18,000 lira. Keep the change. -Thank you, sir- He dropped his registration papers. Mino Alberti... Should I try to catch him? Are you crazy? How could you catch him?... That's stupid. What if the car is stolen? What should we do? We'll call the police station That would be best. You said "Alberti" Yes. I understand a model 8400... dark blue We'll look into it, Of course. Hey, Bianci-- -Yes- Look up the number for this man Somebody found his registration papers. -Alright- There's no answer. Did you dial correctly? Try it again. This is the police... Count Alberti?... Please. Please. Hey listen to this Someone's there Police. Who is there? Do you hear it? We're almost at the ocean I love the sea It reminds me of when I was a young boy When mother let me run And I ran around freely She just didn't see how you would be a good wife for me She barely knows you. The count did this He killed them all And he destroyed their bodies Find him Find the murderer. Attention. Attention All patrol cars in 2A 5B We are looking for a dark blue Fiat 8400 With the license number 42174... repeat 42174 Approach with care... the suspect may be armed. Get out They'll never find us here. Laura-- come on We will spend the night together The longest night we've ever known Just us alone You and me. Brighten up little candle Life is no more than fleeting shadows A wonderful fairytale designed for idiots Everything is noise and fireworks with no meaning I can already smell the scent of the sea But there's nothing I prefer to the scent of you, Laura. Mino-- listen to me You must face reality I'm not Laura It's true. Believe me Laura is dead. Gone. Over She's dead. You went away... but then you came back I will never let you go again. Never. No. No--- Laura! Laura-- Laura!---- - Let me go! - No! Thank God you've arrived There she is... See her?...
