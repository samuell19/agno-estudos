Steady! Go! - Yermolaev, come on! - Nine! - Nine! - Yermolaev! - It's all river's fault. - Why did you jump across it? Couldn't you wade it like everyone did? - What wade? I wanted to shorten the distance. - The distance. A world record: a jump across Niagara. - Here. - C'mon! - Ah you, a son of a regiment. You were a boy on the front, showed the miracles! Why did you lose your bearings now? - That's on the front. - On the front... - Ah, good times! And now, Fyodor Nikolaevich, you are all on the land, and I am all in the water. What a job. Once we'll go sailing for two month, and... Fyodor Nikolaevich, what did you decide - are you staying with us or not? - I don't know, Petya. Will work for a year, look around and will see. - We'll get you married and so on. - Hey you! - It's you who romance a girl, they say. Give me the key. Why not to introduce your elder friend, a captain, so to say. Why not to visit! - She doesn't have time now. - Here. What is she, a high-ranking official? - Come on, Fyodor Nikolaevich. - Give it to her. - You are joking! And I even wanted to ask for an advice! Not a word! - Whoa, I see you are head and heals in love! - Let's go to mine, have some tea! - No, thank you, I need to go home. And your hostess... - But the host is hearty man! Let's go! - No, good-bye, I have no time. - Take care. - Thank you. Good-bye. - First of all understand what a marriage is. Marriage is a conspiracy of women against men. It is a war. You can't pull it out with beauty on its own. - Really? - Really. Beauty saves you there, in the corps-de-ballet. And here is a totally different case. - A case. - Fyodor Nikolaevich, he is the most educated person! And you... - And what me? - You could sign up for a course of current politics. - What? You are not savvy at all in politics. You can't follow a simple conversation. Say, what is going on in Greece now? In China? Or on these... this... Indobrazil? - Indobrazil. - Stop fooling around! Or on these islands! What is their name? Don't know? A thousand questions! She stands as a shadow! - Mother, what a language! - How do you talk to your mother? - I am... - Well, your father is nervous, a man of a certain age. But you could take him as an example! You know, he take such a thick book and rewrites it... - Into a thin notebook. - Come in. - Let me, Fyodor Nikolaevich... I'm for a minute. - Welcome. - Excuse me, it is impossible to work at home, you know, I have a quarterly report, budget, numbers, and it's jeezy-peezy at home. What do you have here? - A prize. - How, one more? - One more. - Why didn't you say anything, Fyodor Nikolaevich! Congratulations from the bottom of my heart! - Thank you. Do you smoke? - No, I quit. A heart, you know... It's all them. A sawmill at home. She saws and saws... - Fyodor Nikolaevich, will you drink coffee with us? - Thank you, Maria Mikhailovna, I just had some. - By the way, will you mind if I put this picture of Olechka on its old place? - Go ahead, let it hang. - Gosh, what a prettiness! Fyodor Nikolaevich, may I take a flower? - Go ahead, take. - Olechka! - Fyodor Nikolaevich! - Yes. - The circus Director have called and asked you to call by tomorrow, from 3 to 5. - To the circus? - Yes. - Why would it be? - I don't know. - From 3 to 5. Strange. KAZIMIR ALMAZOV - Excuse me. - Are you crazy? - Request a Director. Director speaking? Hello! - Pursh! - Where to! - Let me in, out of the way! Home Pursh, back! - It's all clear. You may get out, comrades. Quiet, comrades! And you were hiding here too, huh? - Oh my God! Curious. What are you doing? - You were requesting, saying that your pay-office is too tight, nothing to breath. I see, easily breathing here were 5 people form the accountants, the local committee in body, human resources... - By the way, and you, you, comrade Director, yes, were sitting in my pay-office instead of mobilising and leading the masses, as a head of the industry, on the hunting the predator. Lenochka, daughter, where were you? - Mom! He listened to me! - Who he? - Pursh! I forced him in! - Lenochka, how many times have I asked you, go away from the tigers, leave this job! - Vorontsova! Come here. - And where is my Vasya? Vasya! - What Vasya? - Ferrapont Ilyich! My Vasya! - What Vasya? - He was eaten. - Nonsense! There would be, I don't know, the shoes, buttons left. - No, you don't know him. Let's go. Vasya! - Let's go where? Calm down! - Comrade Director! - Work, comrades, work. No time. - Vasya! My heart, where are you? Nikita Antonovich! - Calm down. Is there a living soul? - I am living. - Maria Ivanovna, dear! - Where is Vasya? - There? - Vasya! - Where is the tiger? - In the cage. - Vasily Vasilyevich. - Vasenka, darling. - Give him something hot, may be a tea, he is completely frozen. - Vasily Vasilyevich, stamp. The most important - stamp. - I stamp. - Warm up. - I didn't know that this fridge is opening from the outside. - What a disgrace! Kazymir Almazov spits upon the society, the labour discipline... - What? It was your respectful daughter who didn't lock the cage after the cleaning. - Not true! You didn't lock! - Keep quiet! Spoiled the girl! You think I don't know how you train her? Opened the courses on the stable. - Yes, I teach. And not only her. - So what! Comrade Director! Yes, I study, but... - Wait, Vorontsova! - And you, comrade Almazov. Every time something happens, and each time it's not your fault but of the service personnel. I will have to report it to the Circus Main Department. - As you wish. Almazov is an attraction. It is a Name, a Showcase, an Audience, Cash. You don't like me! You believe this girl, not me! Go ahead! Keep in mind: if you will be pretending to be a tamer - I will kick you out! Don't forget who you are: a cleaner, that's it. Will not let you close to the animals! Forbid! - Alright comrades, go work. We will sort it out. - Hey, comrade Yermolaev! - Hello, comrade Director. - Frankly speaking, couldn’t wait. - You know, I am here for a while. - Really? - Yes. - Anyway, let's go to my office. - Of course. - Welcome. - Thank you. I hope he was alone? I saw 4 on the showcase. - No way. Welcome. What a day! - Yes... - Take a seat. - Thank you. - How can I help you, Nikita Antonovich? - You see, comrade Yermolaev. Honestly, I am frustrated. But I have a straightforward nature, so will tell you at once: would you want to go to circus? - Circus? Thank you, I saw this programme. - No, you didn't understand me. To go work in the circus. - To work? I don't understand you, Nikita Antonovich. - To become an artist. What's happening, comrades? - Sit. - I am busy, comrades. - We all are busy now, Nikita Antonovich. But there are some moments, where it is person's biography being decided. Comrade Director, I demand of my daughter to submit her resignation from the circus. - Mom! I will not do it anyway. Nikita Antonovich, I ask you... Do you understand, Nikita Antonovich, I can't do without the circus, I can't leave the animals, you know... - She doesn't know what is Kazymir Almazov yet. - Why don't you say anything? - Emmy... - Nikita Antonovich. - Emmy Stepanovna! Don't cry, Vorontsova. Emmy Stepanovna, we will sort this out. But now I am busy. - Nikita Antonovich, I'm asking you. Very much. - Don't be surprised, Fyodor Nikolaevich, she hasn't always been a cashier. It is an old circus family. He is a former clown, and she... what a routine it was! May be you saw in childhood, mademoiselle Emmy Satlerino, the highest school of horse-riding. - No, haven't heard. - It's a pity. - I am far from circus. My sphere is a highest school of... motor. - Here, that's why I invited you. Can you imagine showcase... - A clown on a motorbike? - No, why! Fyodor Yermolaev - a flying motorcyclist! - Nikita Antonovich, I saw something like this... - No, no. You are a brave man, a virtuoso motorcyclist, so I have one idea. Please. - Hooligan, that's it. Why did you go to the Director's? Not satisfied with the salary? Or, may be, the working conditions? And why did you go to the local committee? And accountants, why? What did you forget there? Silly you. Now being quiet, feeling your fault, of course. Here you go, silly, have some water. Calm down, silly. My darling. What if I leave you... - Hi to the wall news! Hello, comrade Myshkin. - Hello - Is the Director in his office? - Yes. - Comrade Myshkin, how do you think, isn't it a good time to mark the work of our accountants in the wall newspaper? - Very good. - You know, we are submitting a financial report before the deadline. I have written a note to the wall news regarding this issue. But I wanted to ask you for an advice. Anyway, I will come to you with this. Good-bye. And where is the report? My report! Report! An animal! Report! Help! - So that is your idea, Nikita Antonovich? - How do you like it? One minute, Fyodor Nikolaevich. Something seems to happen again. - Here. - What here? - An elephant. - What an elephant? Run off, went mad? - Worse. Ate the quarterly report. - Oh my, it's always like this: either one or another! No, Fyodor Nikolaevich, it doesn't happen every day here. And anyway, a nonsense! - Good nonsense! Just think, Fyodor Nikolaevich, what a report, copeck to copeck! The whole month of the work of the whole accountants! - I believe you. - And look at you, Ferrapont Ilyich. Came to the elephant's with a quarterly report! For the elephant to sign? - Listen, maybe we can send him to the hospital? To make a stomach lavage, X- ray, radiography... Oh my God! - Ferrapont Ilyich! Anyway. Fyodor Nikolaevich, let's come back to our business. What will your answer be? - Well, Nikita Antonovich, your idea is very curious, of course. All that you said and all that I saw today. It all is very interesting, of course, but... - But what is stopping you? - To quit the sport... - Why do you need to quit sport? See, Fyodor Nikolaevich, with your routine you will promote the unlimited opportunities of the motor sport. - I see. - Strength, will, bravery! We will put you on the conveyor. - What? Where? - I'm saying, will include in a conveyor. Central Asia, Sochi, Caucasus, Orekhovo-Zuyevo, to Altay, yes. So what? - Frankly speaking, Nikita Antonovich, you have surprised me. - How? - Such a steep turn in my life. - Think about it. Worthy business. - Good-bye. - Your mother is right saying to leave. Leave the circus, Lena. Why do you need it? Today it is a tiger running out of the cage, and tomorrow an elephant will step on your foot. For sure. You know, it's old-fashioned: if the mother and the father are circus artists then the only way for a child is to the arena. And now why to play, Alyona. Wherever you want! And frankly speaking, Alyona, you should come to us, the water transport. So many good girls go sailing! And again, I am close by. Not that you care, I suppose. Why don't you say anything, Lena? - How easy it is for you to say, Petya: leave the circus. And why should I leave? Tell me, why? - He is taunting you, this Kazymir in the shiny boots. - Jackboots. - Yes, jab... these ones... Lena, these tigers will eat you with their teeth. - Good, Petya, let them eat me. And I will get it my own way! If the person has a clear goal, they will get their way! And if I will not - let them eat me then. Tear me to pieces, you know. - Lena, c'mon, enough with these jokes. My heart is broken for years anyway. - Not a word. - Lena, let's go boating. A moon... and all that. - No, Petya, I will not go boating. - Let me walk you home. - No, I don't want to go home. - It's getting dark, Lena. - It's OK, Petya, I will walk alone. Petka, look at you! - Fine! But remember: without Petka Mokin you will not get anywhere. For Mokin is ready for anything for you, and even more. To go through fire and water! Alyona, Mokin!.. - Petya! Where do you go? - Thank you very much! - You? - Me. - And what are you doing here? - Taking the balloons from the trees and trying to recover from the circus adventures. Just imagine, a tiger could eat such a girl! And are you walking? - Sort of. - Take a seat. - No, thank you, don't want. - So do you strongly object taking a sit? - Strongly. - Then excuse me, I have to stand up. - You could figure it out earlier. - I didn't. - Tell the truth, did you chicken out there, in our corridor? - Quivered like an aspen leaf. - I didn't not. - I suppose you were, too, a little bit, in the Director's office: pita pat... - Me? No way. - Yes, yes. - By the way, how did you come to the circus? - By chance. You know, I've been invited to work in your circus. - In the circus? - Yes. - And what can you do? - I am a motor races. - No way! Circus motor racer? - No, it is your Director who thinks that I can work in the circus. - And you what? - And I sit here and think. - Think? You've been invited to the circus! Offered a routine, and you are thinking! - And how not to think? You see... What is your name? - Lena, and yours? - Fyodor Nikolaevich. How not to be thinking? - You know what? - What? - Let's go. - Where? - To the circus. - Why? - I will show it to you now. - Thank you, I've seen enough. - No, you didn't see the real circus, let's go! - C'mon! - It's just 2 bus stops! - Where! Wait! What... Lena! - What? - I have motorbike in the bush, maybe It's go on the motorbike? - Very good, let's go. - Here you go, a bus. Welcome. Take a seat. Afraid? - Me? Not at all! - What? Scary? - No, the balloon flew off! Hurry up! Why are you dragging along so slowly, hurry up! - Just imagine, a tiger could eat such a girl! - What? - I'm saying, a tiger could eat such a girl! - And you could have a good routine. And an assistant in a dress with sequins. - An assistant? - Just like her. Yes, a helper, and assistant. - Good job. - Very good. - Lucky them. Let's go further. - Welcome. Here is our stable. Hello, Lastochka. She is saying hello to you. - Hello. - Atta girl. - Right... Curious. - Of course! It is a circus! - Yes, Nikolay Nikolayevich, a trick with a vase in the air can be done with a help of height-frequency current. Anyway, call by, we'll talk. - Comrade. - What? - Smoking is forbidden here. - I don't smoke, see. Oh, Seryozha, hello! Where are you from? Did you bring the apples? It's alright, let's go to mine. - Lenochka, hello! - Meet each other. - Yermolaev. - Salute. Let's go, don't be late! - Konstantin Grigoryevich, sign please. - Oh, my girl, one moment. Here you go. - And is there a ticket for me to a restoration house? - Everything is ready, you may take it. - What's happening? Kostya, start. - And this is your old fellow Pursh. - Ah, that bad character... - Hush, he understands everything. - No way. - Of course. - Well, I'm sorry. - Do you like it here? - Careful! - Why are you scaring me all the time? - You can't sit there. - You know, it's interesting, very interesting. - And what people we have! Just like a family! I am ready to do anything here! And work with a rake, and clean the cages, and wash the horses. And you have been offered a routine! - Say yes, please. And I will be your assistant, may I? - In a dress with sequins. - Oh, you completely misunderstood me. Circus is not a hobby for me. It is very serious. For the rest of my life. - It is good. - Say yes! - Let's go, see. - Let's go - Hello, Fyodor Nikolaevich. - Hello Olya. - How do you know her? - She is my housemate. - You know what I will show you now... Mommy! Meet each other. - We have already met. - Of course. - A circus artist Fyodor Yermolaev. A nonsense. - Yes! - Ferrapont Ilyich! - Hello. - Sit down. - Thank you. - How are you feeling? - Don't ask. Snakes, elephants, scholarly chickens. Just think, everyone has a normal job. Take for example a Glavryba trust. They have everything in a place. - Yes. - An accountant sits in an accountants office, and a cod in a tin. Give a cigarette. - You don't smoke. Heart and so on. - It doesn't matter anymore. God saves you, my friend, from working in a circus. A terrible place. Trust me. - Yes. By the way, Ferrapont Ilyich, your Director offers me to work in this terrible place. - What? - A motorbike under the circus cupola. - And you? - And me... I don't know. - What is there to think of, my friend? Do you know what a circus is? - But you were just saying... - It is strength, bravery, beauty, scholarly chickens or, say, a rooster-mathematician. A bastard knows a multiplication table. And the elephants - they play drums, dance this.. how is it.. polka... - Panochku. - Panochku. A distinguished, the smartest... the smartest animal! Anyway, congratulations. - No... - And what people! The team! - Too early, Ferrapont Ilyich. Circus is a hard work. - A mastery. - Indeed, a mastery. - Yermolaev - a circus artist! Does it sound good? - Yes... - Hey-pass. - Petya! Where did you disappear? Not visiting, not calling, shame on you! - We were repairing. - Repairing. Give me the scarf. Look, don't disappear please, OK, Petya? Wait for me, I'll be back soon. - Petro! - Hi Petya. - Hello. - Fedya, excuse me for a moment. - So what, are you practicing your jump across Niagara? - No time. And did you quit sport? No, Petya, I will never quit sport. See what changed I have in my life. Became a circus artist. - I see. And Alyonka, Vorontsova. your assistant, is the girl I was telling you about. - What? - Yes. - Oh, Alyona! - Petya! - Hello. - So, Fyodor Nikolaevich, getting acquainted? - I do. - Very good. - See, me and her mother have almost dissuade her from the circus. And here you turned up with your motorbike. - What do you mean - turned up? Mind your language. - What language? I consider her to get run over by a motorbike. Of course, she is an artist now, will go away. Oh... - Wait, wait. I don't understand anything. Tell me everything. Sit down. - Careful, silly. Stop it. Why didn't you jump through the hoop yesterday, lazy? Silly you. Here. Tasty? No more, stop it. - Alright... So you're saying it lasts since childhood. It happens. - It happens. - And the mother and the father agree? - Yes. - And she, Lena, what? - It's known what, pines. But keep in mind, Fyodor Nikolaevich: I will get it my way. My love is - bottomless. - Right... - Why, Fyodor Nikolaevich, you were cheerful and suddenly... - What? - And by the way, Fyodor Nikolaevich, I am possessive. - Go ahead! - Same to you. As you wish. Good-bye, comrade Yermolaev. - Good-bye. By the way, for how long are going sailing? - Almost for a month. - Convey greetings. - Take care, comrade Mokin. - What's wrong? Why are you nervous? - Up! Again there are strangers near the tigers! What did I tell you? - C'mon, don't be too loud. - Who is it? - I am Mokin. - What was told to you? How many times did I tell you: don't get close to the tigers! A poor wanna-be!.. What are you looking at? An airhead! - Kazymir Ivanovich... - Kazymir Ivanovich! - Look at him yelling! And you, Lena, are good too. Why are you hanging around here? He will bite your hand off - and that's it. - Don't get started! Go tell my mom! - I will tell! - Go tell. - Lena... And Fyodor Nikolaevich, he... do you like him? - Fyodor Nikolaevich? Of course! At least he is not persuading me to leave the circus. And I will be an assistant in his routine. And we will leave too. - Go ahead. I'm off myself today. - Where? - Going for kerosene. Anyway, doing business, not like you. Hey-pass, Pursh! - Quiet. That's your understanding, huh? Undeveloped person you are, Petka! - Lena! - Farewell! - Get lost, a cannibal! - Hup, Lastochka! - Fyodor Nikolaevich, show me a bow. - Lenochka... - Show. - Alright. - Fyodor Nikolaevich, not this way. Wait. Dad! - What, daughter! - Show a bow to Fyodor Nikolaevich. - Here you go. - See? Try it. - Thank you, Vasily Vasilyevich, here you go, how... - No, Fyodor Nikolaevich. - Not this way. - Lena, I will never get it. - How never? - And also, I can't be trained as this horse. Our routine is falling apart, so why are we spending time on the bows? - How why? - Prepare the track and let's rehearse. - Good. And a bow is still needed. - See how much easier it is with two twisters. - Yes, but I am used to the ladies saddle, so... - Lena! - What. - Here you go. From Mokin. - Oh, a postcard, thank you. - And more: a letter, a postcard and a telegram, please. In every pocket. Stamps, envelopes, return addresses - I'm walking around as a post box. - Yes. Petenka writes, doesn't forget. - You want to say, misses you. - Misses me. Are you surprised? - Not at all. If I were you I would publish all this mail as a separate book in style of lyrical novel in letters. - And what to do with the phone calls? He calls me from every stop! - Really? - Yes. - And you enclose these ones... receipts, vouchers. Anyway, it's not my business at all! - Oh, a bearcat! - Mr Yermolaev, come here! - What do you want? - Hello. - Hello. Wait, Sasha, where? - Fyodor Nikolaevich, may I ask you a question? - Go ahead. - Tell me... - Well... Of course, Lena, I love children very much. - Why aren’t you married then? - Why?.. There was a war after all. And now, as they say, no one takes. - Strange. - You like singing too? - What's next? I forgot. - Comrades, what kind of sing-along is it? Are you going to sing in your routine on the motorbike? - No, Nikita Antonovich. - Then go to the arena and practice. And remember, the debut is soon! - Pyotr Sergeevich, I request a leave to the shore. - And who was sleeping during the shift today? Shame on you, Kozlov! How does your deck look like? See, you are used to have the guys looking after you! What a prince! And this is a sailor! - Hey, Romeo! Don't lose your watermelons. Put them into the bag. Here you go. - You are supposed to give flowers to ladies! - Hurry up, Petya. - Why? - Nothing special. May be she got married while you were sailing. - C'mon! - Comrade Assistant! - Yes. - The team of the tug "Semyon Chelushkin" requests to send the hearty greeting to the circus artist Lenochka Vorontsova. - Yes to sending the greetings to Lenochka Vorontsova. - C'mon! - Help! - A new attraction: a motorbike in the air. The artists are - Elena Vorontsova and Fyodor Yermolaev. - I wonder, how much does he get for a performance? - You are wondering about anything. - The record trick is being performed: the motorbike jump under the circus cupola. - Bridge. - Attention to the start. - Yermolaev, ready? - Ready. - So... - Yes. - Yermolaev! - You should work hard, my sweet. An artist. Yes. - Lena... - Thank you, Fyodor Nikolaevich. - For what? - For all this. - Come on, Lenochka. Thank YOU. - Me? For what? - You know, I am very happy about everything. That I met you, and that the tiger run off, and that you are with me now. And that we will leave. - And what about Petya? May be he won't let me go with you. - Alyona! - Petya! Hi! Petechka! Hello! Here. From Astrakhan. - So heavy! - Fyodor Nikolaevich, hold it. - OK. - Congratulations. Great! - When did you arrive Petya? - As they say, from a ship to a ball. - Really? - You are so beautiful in this dress! - Really? So, Petechka, good-bye, see you later. I will go to Pursh. He hurt his pad. - Lena! And the watermelons! - Later! - Take your watermelons. Am I a porter or what? - Here. A stupid tiger, a predator is more dear to her than a good man. - Yermolaev! - Good, Fyodor Nikolaevich! - I warn you as an editor of the wall newspaper! - What an outrage! - You will answer for this! - How could he! - Here. You promised but it's alright. - Is it? - No, the most important thing. The annual report - and again before the deadline. - Did you bring it to the elephant to sign? - I know, it's funny, but I was left without the bonus. - What a disgrace! Who's order? - I don't know, the signature was illegible but they say it was you. - Me? A slander. Intrigues. - That's what I thought: intrigues. - But I don't advise you to pass through the elephant. - You know how I pass by the elephant now? Just... - Ferrapont Ilyich... - Lie! - Comrade, what... - Who is it? Me? - You. - What a disgrace! - It is a disgrace! - Vandalism! - Indeed, a true vandalism! - Do you understand that I can't work with you after this! - No it's me who can't work with you. - Don't yell at me please. You have already staggered my central nervous system. - Ah! - Yes. Also, who dared! Some Yermolaev, Some... in circus for a week without a year. A show-off! Some bicyclist! - Who is a bicyclist? Who is a show-off? - That's what I'm saying! If you don't order to take off this thing, this tour-de-bras behind the carpet and a trip for the master of the arena, I will not come into the cage tonight and ruin the performance. - What? - I am awaited in Sochi, Batumi, Sukhumi... - Get out! Get him out now! - Bear in mind: you will not go on the arena not only today but likely at all. - We'll see. - Yes. KAZIMIR ALMAZOV - So comrades, following the order of the Circus Main Department, for the multiple violation of a labour discipline, for an appearance on the arena being drunk Kazimir Almazov, real name Kuzma Pyzhov, is fired. The tigers are left with us. And our team has to seriously consider nominating a suitable candidate to replace Pyzhov. I recognise the chief accountant with an information note. Please, Ferrapont Ilyich. - Comrades, I know you are tired after the performance, I will try not to keep you long. I just want to remind you, do you know how much a down-time of 4 tigers costs to the state. Wait a minute, the picture is the following. 8 kilos of meat, comrades. 8! 2 eggs. Half litre... what half litre? Oh no, just milk. 20 grams of fish oil, Vitamins A, B, D, not to mention C. I have to tell you, comrades. It is a diet of one tiger. Multiply it by 4. Add a service personnel, fund-rising which, as you know, doesn't play the difference anymore unfortunately. In front of us there is a catastrophic amount of loss. I need to tell you, comrades, that if in the second quarter anyone of us... I mean of you. won't go into the tiger's cage... yes, into the cage! than this animals will eat a budget for a half year. That's it. - So, are there any ideas? Who wants to say anything? - Me. - C'mon! - No! - Comrades, I share the concern of the chief accountant. They will eat this budget, indeed. As a matter of self-criticism I admit the article of Yermolaev and the order - all is right. I just have one question: who will go into the cage? - Someone will go! - Speak about yourself! - What? I propose to lodge a motion and support my candidature. I am Almazov anyway! It's not easy to replace me! - Wait, comrades, wait. - Almazov. Do you really think you are irreplaceable? - That's what I think, comrade Yermolaev. - I don't know, I am a new person in circus... - Indeed. - May be I don't understand a lot, but I don't believe that the team wouldn’t find a suitable person. - Right! - Comrades, I think we should just confidently nominate the youth. - And you, comrade Almazov, should be replaced by the youth. - Let them try, comrade Yermolaev. - Quiet, comrades, quiet! - Pour me something. It's OK. They will bow into my feet. What a beastliness. - Vitamins. Give me something to eat. Let somebody walk into the cage. I will tell my kittens "Bonne appetite". - Eh, comrade Pyzhov. If there were no Anton there would be no you. You see, Kazymir Almazov. And "Pyzhov" doesn't work for him. And "Kuzma" doesn't sound. And Minin, a Hero of the Fatherland, was not ashamed by being Kuzma. - Vasily Vasilyevich, enough with your cheap demagogy. I can't be scared by it. I will still complaint to Moscow. - Go ahead. - Almazov... - Almazov is a Name, a Showcase, an Audience, Cash! - Careful! - What a bustard! And no use to argue. - We need to mobilise without redundant discussions and roll up the sleeves. It is a question of an honour, there is nothing to wait for. We need to take a whip and with all the responsibility go into the cage. - You go. We trust you enough. - Who me? Where? To the cage? Thank you very much, comrades, for the trust, but I have a routine. - Everyone has a routine. - Wait, comrades, I cannot risk myself. I have kids. - Everyone has kids. - Whatever you wish, the question is not about me. Here I have several nominees suitable enough. Say, why not comrade Myshkin? An excellent socialiser, and editor of a wall newspaper, a member of a local committee. - Just a minute! Comrades, it is a very serious question. The job is hard, and no one should be obliged or forced. Everything is about a personal desire of an artist. So I propose to take my information for consideration and think about it carefully. The meeting is over. - Nikita Antonovich, I want say, how right I was about this Almazov. - I believe that the only solution is clownage evenings. Remember my word. - We will talk about it. - So, baby, how are you feeling? Does the pad getting better? What should we do, Purenka? Purcha, may be go for it? Let's go for it? Dad! Daddy, you know what? - I think I know... What can I say, daughter. In an old fairy-tale Ivan-the-fool dives into a boiling kettle. It is more scary than tiger. But from there he appears being a gorgeous Prince Ivan. - Jump, daughter! - Daddy, look! Support! - Yes, come in. - Nikita Antonovich... - What? - Nikita Antonovich... - Say, what? - I agree. - What do you agree with? - I take the tigers. - Who you? Bother it! - What do you mean - bother it? And the meeting? - What meeting? - I am a youth! - So what? - And the tigers are attached to me, they love me, they know me. Telegin is training me for a year already. - Telegin? - Yes, he engages for me. - Well-well, let me look at you. - Nikita Antonovich, do you know how the tigers listen to me! I just need to say "Pursh, hey-pass!" - and he walks where I want. - Well, you have a drive! So you want to take the tigers. - Oh, Nikita Antonovich... - Good for you! And Telegin engages for you? - He does. - That's the youth! Wait... and what about Yermolaev? The trip? No, it will not work. - How won't work! Nikita Antonovich! Fyodor Nikolaevich is a real man, he will understand me. - You think so? - He can't misunderstand. - Actually, he must understand you. But you talk to him necessarily. And I will get in touch with the Circus Main Department. - Good. - Lena, hello. - Oh, Lenochka! Finally. Let's pack. We don't have anything packed yet. - Fyodor Nikolaevich, I don't go anywhere. - Lenochka, there is no time for jokes, let's pack. - I'm not joking. I took the tigers. - What? - Fyodor Nikolaevich, I took the tigers of Almazov. Understand? - But it's dangerous, it's risky, Lena! - It is. But for me not more than for everyone else. - Wait, I don't understand anything. And what about our routine, the trip? - You see, Fyodor Nikolaevich, I am very easy to replace in your routine. It can be done by absolutely any actress. I don't know, any. You see? It's just several rehearsals needed. - I see. - And the tour... - No, Lena, it is absolutely impossible. - Fyodor Nikolaevich, but I don't do anything in you routine. You must understand me. It is my calling! It's my destiny if you wish! - Frankly speaking, I was not expecting this from you. And when - at the departure day! Why didn't you talk to me, ask for an advice? How is it possible, Lena! - Don't be mad at me, Fyodor Nikolaevich. - Don't becalm me, I'm not a child. - You can't understand me... - No, YOU can't understand me! - No, I understand you perfectly. Your routine is more important for you than my destiny. I understand that. What do you want, tell me? For me to be your assistant in the routine for the rest of my life? Cleaning your motorbike! - Lena! - Of course! How are you better that Kazimir Almazov? - Lena! - He also wanted to keep me at the stable with a broom all the time! - Do you understand what you are saying now? - I do. - Shame on you. - There is no shame on me. And you are simply an egoist. Don't throw my things to the chest, please. - No, it's just a joke! Truly, a joke! What kind of a tamer are you? Did you see yourself in the mirror? You in a cage with tigers! A little pimple! - A little pimple? You know what, we just don't have anything to talk about. I have never ever thought that we will part ways like this. - Lena! - Fyodor Nikolaevich! - Sorry, Olya, I have no time... - One minute! The Director has a meeting. - I need to see the Director. - You can't go there! - Nikita Antonovich, I am totally against... Where is the Director? - What? Don't stop us from working! The Director is personally testing my equipment. - Wait. - What's going on? - Wait for 10 minutes! - Nikita Antonovich... - What's going on, Fyodor Nikolaevich? I'm busy, I have a meeting. - Nikita Antonovich. - What? Careful! It's my head. - Am I doing good? - You are doing everything good! I can't do anything, Nikita Antonovich! I am totally against Vorontsova leaving my routine, I can't do without her! - What? - I mean... It's the departure day, Nikita Antonovich. - Wait, didn't she talk to you about it? - She did, but it's doesn't make it easier for me, Nikita Antonovich. - Calm down first of all! - Comrade Yermolaev, wait for 10 minutes, the attraction "Talking Head" is falling apart! - Let me out of here at last! - How can I be calm, Nikita Antonovich, when a hardly set routine is falling apart! Who could come up with it, I don't understand! - See, it is a desire of Vorontsova herself first of all, supported by me. - And me. - And Komsomol. Furthermore, I spoke with the Circus Main Department, they approve. Don't grief, Fyodor Nikolaevich. No one is going to ruin your routine. You will find a suitable partner, will rehearse everything on the spot. And if you don't mind, we even have a suitable candidate. - Olechka from the corps-de-ballet. - Do you know her? - I don't care anymore, Nikita Antonovich: Olechka, Valechka, Manechka. - Got upset, poor fellow. - Nikita Antonovich, and what about a hoaking tead? - What? - I mean, my routine, a talking head. May be like this? - Wait, my own head is like this. - So what? - What? - Did you decide? - We did. You are going. - And you, comrade Vorontsova, I will ask to give the costumes and the props, possibly now. - Good. To whom? - Her. - Fyodor Nikolaevich! But she is short and puffy. - Sort it out. - No, everything will just hang on me. That's fine, take a thread and a needle and tailor. Let's go. - Wait! I wanted to ask you something about Fyodor Nikolaevich. - He is your housemate. - Yes, but you worked with him. - What kind of character is he? - A bad one. An egoist. - Does he like at least anything? - Tomatoes. Welcome! Here you go. - Tell me, didn't you ever like him? - Him? Tall, snub-nosed! No way! - I will tell you a secret: I am in love with him... - Bad for you. - Why? - He is married. And you know, they say he has three kids: two in Penza and one in Kamchatka. Receive the props. A motorbike. The ends. Good-bye. - Oh... two in Penza and one in Kamchatka. - Olechka... Read newspapers. And buy them daily, 20 copeiks is not a loss. The most important is that you are near him, understand? - I understand, mommy! - Yes! And don't forget to hang your portrait everywhere! - OK. - So that he would gradually get used to it. How is it called... reflex. - So good-bye. - Fyodor Nikolaevich, I ask you... - Fyodor Nikolaevich, I ask you... look after Olechka, Fyodor Nikolaevich, I trust you. - Good-bye, Ferrapont Ilyich. - Good-bye. - Olechka, good-bye. - Fyodor Nikolaevich, look after Olechka! - So, my darling, we can assume that Olechka is settled in. A load off our minds. Now I can peacefully die. Ice cream pop? Three please. - Mashenka, isn't it a lot before death? Excuse us. - Here Pursh, come to me! Baikal! Come on! Hey-pass! Come on, Lena! Set in! Into place, Baikal! Into place! Who am I talking to! Into place! Into place! - Yermolaev! ROSTOV KAZAN MINSK KIEV - Fyodor Nikolaevich. - What Lenochka? - I'm not Lenochka, I'm Olechka. Not so hard to remember. - I am sorry. - Your favourite. - What? - Tomatoes. - I hate them since childhood. I get something like a nettle-rush from them. A terrible beastliness! - How is it?.. - Get a candy, Pursh. Here you go! Pulechka, my sweet. Here is more. - Alright, Lena. Wonderful, very good. Have a rest and we'll continue the training. - Anton Ivanovich, congratulate me, a big joy! Look, what is published in the papers. Look what a review on the artist Yermolaev and my daughter, Olechka. What a success. - Congratulations, Ferrapont Ilyich. - Thank you. - Yes, and I congratulate you too. - By the way, they are coming back soon. - Who knows, may be... huh? - What? - Let's go training! - Why did you fall into muse? Lena, let's go. - What's wrong, Lena? You have your first performance for the public tomorrow. What a shame! You should be a master of yourself under any circumstances. What a shame... Anything can happen in life. Let's go, let's go! Alright. In this shape I will not let you on the arena. I will go to the Director right now and tell him that I free myself from any responsibility. - What? - Yes, let him cancel the show! - What? Do you understand what you are saying? I will go into the cage anyway! - I will not let you! - And I say I will! - No! - You will not dare! How no! Do you understand what you are saying! I will go into the cage! - No you won't! - No I will! - Here is a character. Good for you, Lena! - I have a terrible character. - A wonderful character. Just what the tigers need. - But he is not a tiger. He is a human. - Could be a bit more modest in bowing? - Fyodor Nikolaevich, such a success! I have always be dreaming about it! Thank you very much for everything! - You're welcome. Quieter. - I am so happy! Oh, and what sort of men! - I am sick of listening to it! - Fyodor Nikolaevich, don't be mad! - You are saying nonsense! - I understand your feelings perfectly. I know everything. You are married. And you have three kids: two in Penza and one in Kamchatka. - You are crazy! - Me? - Please. - I'm coming! - Come back! - Congratulations! - Thank you! - Good-bye, all the best. - Outrage! - Good-bye, all the best. - What did you make up? Two in Penza... Who did tell you such an oddity? - Lena Vorontsova. - Lena? - Yes. Don't you believe? You can ask her yourself. Yes, by the way, she has a debut tomorrow. - What? - She has a debut tomorrow. - How tomorrow? - My dad had written to me. - Ah devil! - Listen, Olya, I beg you, look after the luggage, I will go today. - But there is no train today! - It's OK, I will find a way. - Good-bye, all the best. - Tall, snub-nosed, not interesting. - Where are you going! - How is it, mommy? - Everything is very... very original, Lenochka. This medallion your father gave me in the day of my first performance. - Petya, hush... Behind this door there is an artist being born. - How? - Yes, I know, I was being born too. - Me!.. - Petechka, don't get Lena nervous before the performance! I beg you, darling! Understand the state she is in! Imagine that in several minutes you have to walk into the cage with the tigers. And here someone will make a love confession. Later, Petechka. After them. I am so nervous, Petechka. - Do you think I am calm? Oh, bastards! - Comrade Yermolaev! - Fyodor Nikolaevich! - Oh! Petya! Hello, friend! - Hello. - Fyodor Nikolaevich, are you here? - Yes, arrived and not late. - Yes. - So, how is Lena? - There, at hers. No, Fyodor Nikolaevich, no one is accepted. In three minutes is a beginning, the third bell. - I see. And why are you so dressed up? With a bouquet. - See, Fyodor Nikolaevich, I have decided. I want to get married urgently. And bring her to the village, to the aunt, you know? In the case of anything, I will stamp my foot, and she will listen to a husband. - Alright... So, did you get her consent? - I will. But when - don't know myself. You see, once there is a good moment for the conversation, it becomes as a kettle ball. - Who? - Tongue. So, Fyodor Nikolaevich, I wrote a letter. Don't know whether it's good or bad, listen. Hello Lena. No, Petya, don't ask me, I am not an adviser in this issues. - No, Fyodor Nikolaevich, it's good. Hello Lena. If you first make metal white-hot, and then to the cold water straight away, then it is still getting harden. And so do I. So, how is it? - What? - Did you come to her? To Lena? - To her. - So... no.. you... - Listen, Petya, me... - No.. No, Fyodor Nikolaevich, it will not work. - Papa. - Announcing. - Good. - So, Vorontsova, I am not a superstitious person, but break a leg! - Dash it! - Vorontsova, I was not expecting this! - Today, for the first time on the arena of our circus, a young artist Elena Vorontsova will perform with a group of tamed tigers. - Back up! - We approve. - Where does the labour protection look? - Such a wife is a serious perspective for a marriage. What is husband for her? A mosquito, not more. Look how she hushes on the tigers. She will scream at you after the registration: "Hey-pass, Mokin!" - Uncle Vasya, stop your jokes. - And so you will jump from a stand to a stand. - Bravo! - Nikita Antonovich! - So? - What so? - Did the youth ever let you down? - On the opposite! Congratulations, good for you! I liked it so much that I even lost a weight! - So dad, now it's your turn! - I'm practicing, daughter, I'm practicing! - And maybe I should too, Nikita Antonovich, turn the clock back and start dancing on the horse? - Congratulations, dear. - Thank you. - My daughter! - You might want to stay alone. - Daddy! - Petya! Petenka! So what? Did the tigers eat me? - Oh, Alyonka... Consider me be getting older for 20 years through this night. Funny, huh? It wasn't funny for me. Let me drink some water. Where do you keep the glasses? - So good! - May be you have valerian? What a job! And how they roar! As animals! I mean... you understand. Elena Vasilyevna. Elena Vasilyevna. Hold the bouquet, it distracts me. Here. Read. - What is it? - And immediately, do you hear? Immediately answer. - "Hello Lena. " Hello Petya! "If you first make metal white-hot... " Wait, what is it - an innovation proposal? - Yes. Read, you! Read further! The proposal! But not for innovation, but a marriage one! Here. - And immediately, do you hear? Lena, answer now. - Petya... Petenka... You are my best, my favourite, you are my only... friend. But... - Do you love him? Oh well. Love cannot be forced. - I am sorry. - Fedya! - Congratulations, Lena, from the bottom of my heart. A great success. - Thank you. - Here. And in general, congratulations. - Thank you. And there is no reason to congratulate me, Fyodor Nikolaevich. It's me, who congratulates you and wishes happiness, a lot of happiness, Lena. - Pyotr! Sit down, Lena. I was wrong, Lena. I don't know whether we will ever be together, But if it is one month in a year, a week, a day, like now, I will be with you - I will be happy, and you? Shame on you - hugging a married man who has three kids: two in Penza and one in Kamchatka. Oh you, a little pimple. THE END
