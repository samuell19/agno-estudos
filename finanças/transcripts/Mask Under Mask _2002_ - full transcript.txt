A long time ago, hidden inside a long forgotten rocky mountain in Paraguay, there was a palace called San Vanidad. Life at the palace was determined by an agonizing principle, an all-pervasive system, the dream of eternal youth, of being flawless. Beauty and sustaining the illusion of perfection were the only guarantee for the right to live in San Vanidad. Those with flaws were banned to the deep darkness at the foot of the illustrious palace. One man, whose story will be told here, was the ruler of San Vanidad. Nobody was more excessive, more greedy and more conceited. Good choice, mi capitan. It was good advice, loyal Gomez. Cabron, this is for you, bastard. Mark his face and throw him out of the palace, ahora! No! With respect, mi capitan, punish him by death. Banishment may be a bitter punishment for this coward's betrayal, but it's such cowardly betrayers that you need to make an example of. Throw him into the rat dungeon. You heard him, into the rat dungeon. I curse you. You should rot in hell. Black death shall take you. Rot in hell. I curse you. A dramatic appearance, an impressive example, that's how one rules the people. Why did he do that? Amor, mi capitan, he loves one of the girls you've chosen for tonight. And? Is that a reason? Valdez de Coarazon. He didn't need a reason to love. He took and got whatever he wanted. But what he really desired remained refused. Alyssa de Espella. She possessed the secret of eternal youth. The unchangeable perfection, the key to power. Only one thing could free her from this curse: Love. Enviousness, dear Lorenzo. Enviousness? Enviousness is human, I'm not ashamed of it. Let me ask you a question, por favor. How many of these beauties does Valdez need for himself to be satisfied? Wrong, Lorenzo. The question should be, how many beauties are necessary to satisfy Valdez? And the answer is? Mi capitan. I'm very pleased that you've come, dear Alyssa. Even more so as I didn't dare to expect your appearance. What brought you to that assumption. Way too often my hopes and wishes haven't met with your favor. It seems that too often your hopes and wishes aren't bound to myself. What can I do to have you spend this night with me? If you deny me your pleasant company for the evening, let alone for the night I'm dreaming of, so at least give me this dance. And should you displease my person, don't forget you're doing it for your regent. Did I hear a threat in your words? You heard despair. Has Alyssa ever danced with anybody? 100 years ago. She's that old? They say... Unbelievable. - Would she be an ex... Keep your fantasies to yourself, Gomez. We're living in a sexually educated world. Of course. You're quite silent today, Valdez de Corazon. If I could find those magical words that would open the way to your heart, I'd give my tongue and even my lips that long for kisses for that. That would be foolish. Yes, it would. But still, I would do it. But still, once again you're trying to defeat me with words. Defeat you? I subdue myself. I love this man and his insatiableness. Words. Do you ask for actions? I don't ask for what you can't give. Then take it. If there's something that could cost his head, it's this woman. Torture me to your liking. With words, with chains, with all your feminine wiles and your gracefulness. Then let me, and if only during this dance, continue to dream of the most wonderful couple in San Vanidad. You are too much a ruler, Valdez, and too less a man. But still my heart lies in your hands. But still I don't feel anything beat. Well, what is she? - A witch? A dazzler? A fairy? A goddess, a sun. Well then, don't get too close to her. Do you want to hold me? - What is it that's driving you? Her secret. As with every woman. No, amigos, no. I can have every woman, even every man if I'd like to, you know that. But she, Alyssa, she has the real power. I feel it. Well then, why do you hesitate? En garde, Lorenzo. You are right, friend Gomez. Is she the right woman? Bueno, Ivan. Profess your doubts. You're misinterpreting the legends and rumors, dear Valdez. There's no eternal beauty, only the dream of it. And Alyssa. Beautiful and clever like a dream. Si, Ivan, but some dreams come true. Some nightmares too. Keep in mind, she lives in her chamber like a saint, like a spider. You wouldn't be the first regent who isn't able to satisfy her hunger. But she's the first to satisfy mine. Do it like Lorenzo. Take what you can get. For you that'd still be everything. Not long now. Just like you I'm getting older, with every day. Who of us will be the first to throw the others out of the palace? No. I'm not a man of suffering. I am who I am and that's my power. And if there's a chance to stay like this, I will take it, I will ask for it, and Alyssa has it, the eternal youth, the everlasting beauty. Dream and reality will only merge with this woman at my side. What are you doing here? To give you what you don't feel beating in your hands. For how long are you here? - The whole night. You're not allowed to. Love's allowed to do whatever it wants. How did you enter? Love will always find a way. - You must go. Not without your heart. You got mine not only since this night. And one can't live without at least one heart. Words. The only action would be to love you, but you're the one who's hesitating. What worthy action are you doing? I'm waiting, this night and every day, again and again until bitter death. So is it really love that's driving you? I mean true love? Flesh that scars after a wrong bite, because it can grow only once. Blood that boils and fevers. Only destroyed, only united. Breath that, once exhaled, never leaves the world. That never again avoids one's own lungs, that's it. And you hurt me with those words like I wanted my words to hurt you. It's easy to get hurt, but difficult to trust. What are you afraid of, if not of love itself? If you know what you're talking about, you know the reasons for my fear. Only those who dare to love will win the love. Nobody else has ever won, except darkness and fear. But what does love win? Us. But still, swear me an oath. Thousands of them. Just one, Valdez, but swear it like it's thousands. With body, heart and soul, I'm all yours. But never ever, Valdez, visit me during the night like you did today. A strange oath. If you're in doubt don't do it. I swear it, blind and honest. Forever? Forever. Look, Lorenzo. Our couple. Nobody can hide himself from the magic that surrounds Alyssa. What's the name of this magic? What's the formula? I don't understand. The formula, Lorenzo. The thing that keeps the world together. The reason why Alyssa is what she is. Why does our best friend marry this woman? He believes in her magic. He believes in keeping his power, even increasing it, for eternity. He thinks he's magical himself. And we are lucky to be able to attend this phenomenon, and it's our duty to protect it. With a formula? No, caro Lorenzo, with knowledge. Knowledge creates the mightiest force, and its best protection. Buenas noches. Following recent incidents, Amor shot his arrow, and I, Cavaleiro Lorenzo, have the honor to present you, senoras y senores, our traditional freak show. Blainhead, caught in the Hyena Valley, '82 vintage. Your friends have really gone out of their way to organize this festival for you. It's our festival, and my friends are also your friends. You're taking life as light as a feather, aren't you? Freak... It sounds so sad when you talk about life. Thereby it's you who's wearing the most beautiful feather. When the lion envied the condor for his curse, do you know what the condor replied? Every time I open my wings it costs me the strength of 100 footsteps and I only fly because I have to. And... now... a... survivor from the Torrid Waters. What could drive a human into doing this? Why don't you ask him yourself? Tell me, creature, Did you enter the Torrid Waters by choice? Why? Because it opens your eyes, mi capitan. Release all the creatures. And give each of them a handful of gold. Why do you smile? Do I smile? Like a young cat that can't get his paw out of the mouse hole. I'm stuck. - But still smiling? I'm not giving up the game yet. You're talking about games, but it's your life that you're giving to me. My love, which is worth more than my life. That's why I'll never be able to let you go. All the more it's my duty now to interrupt our gathering. If it serves the purpose of making our union even stronger. I'll be awaiting you at dawn. Please excuse me. This is our wedding night. We have all the days of our lives. Beloved Valdez. Is she displeased? No. What are you thinking, capitan? He isn't thinking, he's raging. She's playing with you, right? And you don't know how to win. Take care, Valdez, she's a spider. And you're a fly. You are the regent, the ruler... - If you tear her cobweb apart... You mustn't be foolish. - And also not dumb. She possesses a power no man can cope with. She's a goddess. Every man would be afraid, and obedient. Let yourself be guided by reason, mi capitan. Stop raging. Think of your folk. Still you are the regent. You dare? How could I not? You gave your word. And you gave me yours. You can't break your oath. I can't? What should I do? Keep my word and lose face? Look into the mirror and see a different man? Ignore my passion for you as if it's a plague? You don't know what you're saying. - Oh, I do. I didn't take you as my wife to live a dire existence at the foot of this tower. You knew what was awaiting you. You're the wife of Valdez. I beg you, leave. - Never. I insist on my right, carry out your duty. Who are you? Alyssa, your wife. Now you know my secret. You promised me your love. Now keep your word. We belong together. Nothing on this world can kill me, but it's in your hands, Valdez de Corazon. Love me like I am, day and night, in perpetuity! Away with you! In perpetuity! You can't flee from me, Valdez! My curse is your curse. I'll always find you. Buenos dias, mi capitan. Did she animalize you? Looks like she's quite wild. Seriously, why the masquerade? Bags under your eyes? No, mi companeros, no. The festivities are just about to begin. Lorenzo, declare the following: We stage a masked ball. Festive plate, best wines, demasking will be punished with branding. The duration of the festivities is undecided. Ahora, por favor. Gomez, Ivan, stay. Alyssa's strolling somewhere through the city. Catch her before she can enter her chamber. So she really is a spider that eats the males? - Do I look eaten? No. She's not a spider. She's a snake, una bruja. Should we kill her? - No. Take her to the dungeon, chain her and entomb her inside the wall. The jailer's already waiting. Accion, senores. Hey you. Who, me? Yes, you. What do you have there? Er, nothing. Nothing you'd want. Some noses, small fingers. Do you want them? Do you? Really great goods. Really great fingers, wonderful fingers... How much is it? Lady Regent, buenos dias. What do you propose to be our next step? Going by Valdez' behavior she seems quite dangerous. We should take a squad of guards for support. Dear Ivan, I totally agree with you. Guards! This former nobleman just committed high treason. Guard, take him away! Gomez. Ahora! Gomez. Gomez. Gomez! Gomez! Bury him alive! The jailer's waiting for him. Good morning, mi capitana. From what I've heard you had a pretty wild night. Our beloved regent, your dear husband, has told us this morning to organize a masked ball for you. It's better you wear something appropriate. You think so? By the way, Valdez wears the mask of the crowned lion. Hasta la vista, mi capitana. Alyssa? I left a hole in the wall in case you want to see her. Close it. Where's Ivan? I'm sure he's having some fun. Bueno. Alyssa. Keep on dancing, Valdez, it's not yet midnight. Wasn't it you who was searching for eternal youth? Now you have it in your hands, eternal youth, neverending beauty. I don't want it. You wanted me. I lied. You didn't. You spoke from the bottom of your heart. From the bottom of my heart, yes, and also in love, but I didn't know the conditions. Love knows no conditions. Why do you speak with a forked tongue? - Forked only to him who lost his own tongue. Listen to your heart, Valdez. Avow yourself to me. Never! You don't have a choice. Love me, Valdez. Live with me, suffer with me. Never! Then you'll die a death that's crueler than life. You know my secret, I have power over you. We belong together. Never! Listen to your heart, Valdez, and free both of us. I need you in the dungeon, you witch! Mi capitan, you have some dirt on your face. It's better you wipe that stain away. Poor Valdez, you're a victim of your own system. As you know, every flaw is being punished with banishment. He isn't flawless. That doesn't look good. Ahora! Out. Long live the new regent, Don Gomez. Hey, open up. Valdez. Your regent. Ahora. Open up. Open up! Open up! Open up, por favor! Soy Valdez! Open up! Bastardo! Is he awake, is he? Bueno. He wants one too? Should somebody know, that Valdez is here, Valdez, then they'll kill him, the Valdez. Everybody. And you? Who're you? Me? I'm Frekno, hombre, I'm Frekno. Look. Read. They'll kill the Valdez. Nobody likes him. Nobody, hombre. Not even Alyssa anymore. What do you know about Alyssa? Beautiful woman, smart woman, good woman. Didn't have a chance. If you're sure that I'll be killed, why don't you kill me then? Before Alyssa does it. You think I won't do it? Why shouldn't I? You want to offer a deal? Do you? You want to compromise me? Do you? They say Frekno's greedy, that I can never get enough. But that ain't true, ain't it? And Alyssa's a beautiful woman, a smart woman, and good. Why shouldn't Frekno be smart too, for once? Be smart, just a little. Tryin' something out, how about it, Valdez? Valdez. Poor sod. Really poor sod. Maybe he deserves a chance? Maybe. Make an offer. What offer? - Any, rapido. I've nothing. Not even gold teeth. Open it. Open it! Healthy teeth. More value than gold, more value than gold. And Valdez, poor sod, really poor sod. He wants rather to live or to die? To live. At any cost. - He's lucky. My leprosy is noncontagious. I got contacts, hombre. Contacts. Si. Bueno, bueno. Vamos. Away, away, away. Shoo, shoo. Come. Hey. Frekno, old friend. How're you gonna con me today? - Shut up or I'll go to your neighbor. Come. Pissed off already? Can't you take a joke? Come, come, come, look at him, come, come. Bueno, bueno. Excellency! Doesn't look that good. Not good but rare. Understand. Let's see what we can do. No, no, no, come, come. Hey, hey, hey. Okay, okay. But I keep the ears, even if they aren't that good. Any special requests, Excellency? Come, come, come. The lower racks are free to choose. The ones above contain the perfect stuff, but they cost extra. No, no, no, that's not adviseable in your situation, no, no, no. You're in good hands. Nobody will recognize you, not even me. Afterwards he'll look like a human, he will, he will. Por favor. Mouth and cheek we'll take from him. For the rest canned stuff. Wait a sec, just a tiny formality. Vaya con dios. He awakens, he awakens. Yes! Well? Satisfied? Once the scars are healed the face will look even more harmonic. But the pain will stay for another couple of weeks. If Her Excel... Ah yes, if you want I can sell you some pain killers. He doesn't need it, not him, doesn't need it. Muchas gracias. And now come, come, come. Get up, come, come, come, yes, good boy. Vaya con dios, my friend. Adios amigo, let's go, let's go, come. Nurse, next one. Fantastic. Not even I can recognize him. Show me. No, don't know him. If he got another deal, he knows where to find me. Fortuna, hombre, fortuna. - My hands. No, no, no, my hands, mine. Why did you do that? - Why not? Had no hands, needed hands. That's cheating. - Damn leprosy. You crook. Frekno doesn't cheat, not Frekno, Frekno keeps his word. This contract, read. Take it easy, por favor. Por favor. Bueno, bueno. He needs a hand for work, or what he thinks he'd eat? And he needs a name. Now he's called... Rafael. - No. No? Si. Every second one's named Rafael. Or he wants to attract attention? He got some business, he comes to me. Frekno doesn't cheat, right? Fortuna, Rafael, fortuna. Fortuna. Nice noses, ears, small fingers... Hey, you. Want an apple? Gracias, but you seem to be in more need. What's your name? Rafael. - I'm Lucia. Nice to meet you, Rafael. What've you done with your hands? Your hands look like they'll be strong hands once they're healed. Do you need work? Well, then, good luck, Rafael. Maybe we'll meet again. Lucia. Not so shy, or you won't be able to stand me for long. Where are you from? I don't know. Did that charlatan amputate your brain too? They like to do that. - You should know. Indeed. I exchanged my brain for this. In case one of these damn palace citizens crosses my way. At the East Gate they once killed two even though only one had a scar on his cheek. Better one innocent too many than one guilty too less. My opinion. What is yours, Rafael? Leave him, Rosita, don't you see he's totally exhausted. You better pack this away before someone steals it. But that's no reason to not celebrate the start of his new job. Raise your glasses. Bottoms up. My mother's a whore! That's enough for today. Let's not forget two coins for the revolution purse. Stop working, Rafael, let's celebrate for now. Come, take a seat. Sit down, boy. Is that all you earned today? But don't worry you'll improve. Wait! Two coins, for the revolution purse. They're afraid you might be a spy. Spy. Si. One's got to be careful, they're getting more and more brutal. Gomez? Valdez, Gomez, doesn't matter. One's like the other. Why don't you go into the palace? You're young and beautiful. You must be kidding. Four years ago they killed my mother. She openly denounced the regent. Together with some friends my father tried to find the place they buried her remains. Nobody came back. I'll stay here, this is my home. Well, that's it for now. Alyssa. - Alyssa. She's beautiful, right? You know her? Nobody knows her. Or where she came from. She's bewitched but she's good. She'll free us all, she's our only hope. Now have a nice dream in your new home. Good night. Alyssa. Alyssa. Dearest Alyssa, please open the door. Please! Alyssa! What's going on? I cited you, this morning, 6 o'clock. I know. I waited for hours. Relax, Gomez, the day is long. I guess you have all the time in the world? But not you, or so it seems. Well then, mi capitana. Don't get me wrong, I don't want to dispute your privileges. I wouldn't dare to understand it that way, dear Gomez. We have cooperated together very well in the past. I don't know what you mean. Okay. Who cares about the past, we're living here and now. Let me say it another way. You gained your privileges at the palace because of a certain tradition. Your existence is of an outstanding constancy. Constancy and tradition are high values. All I'm striving for is to maintain them. And yourself with them. You're as smart as you're beautiful. What can I do for you? Guards! I'd like to talk to you about your grace and beauty. A talk about cosmetics? No. I have other experts for that. What then? Tell me your secret. What secret? The secret of your eternalness. And if there's no such secret. Then Valdez would be a fool. A bigger one than myself. And if I don't want to tell you, or can't? Then I have other ways and means. Which ones? Pure physical violence, mi capitana. And you're not afraid? Of what? Of feeling the secret with your own body. Don't hesitate, Gomez. You're the regent. And? She wants to be discovered, like a continent. Conquered like a new America. Like every woman. Why did Valdez fail? Because of his stupidity. What will you do? Be smarter. Well, brave girl, how do you feel? I'm fine. You want more tea? - Definitely not. How's the tavern going? - Way better without you. Because it's easier to cheat Rosita? Because she's got a sweeter voice when she yells at us. Take this. Will you tell me a tale? I already did too often. Please. The one with the condor and the lion. Well then. Once upon a time there was a vain lion. Come down, Rafael, and... Okay. I have to go down. Will you come back later and finish the story? Yes. Promise? - Promise. Here, Carlos. Ah, Rafael. What're you going to do with all the money? I don't know. I'm sure you have something in mind. Yes, maybe I'll get some new furniture. Sounds like you'd like to start a family. At first I thought you were a thief. Or an exile from the palace? Or maybe even a spy? Maybe I really was one once. You're an ugly guy, Rafael. But I like you. The next drinks are on me, companeros. How about one last round, a wet round? I know where you can get a wet round. For Rosita. Have you brought your knives, asshole? - Si, si. Buenas noches. - Buenas noches, amigo. Drop your pants! - Hold on, Carlos, hold on. Hey, old lady. Time to go. Take a seat, nino, and talk with me. I don't have anything to say. Only that old women like you should already be in bed by such a time. Alyssa. Did you really think you could flee from me, Valdez? What do you want from me? - You. Back off. - Never. I keep my word. As you can see I'm no longer the same. Are you not? - I'm not. No regent, and definitely not beautiful. I live an honest life. Hard, full of privation, but honest. A tiny happiness, smaller than a grain of sand. Then let us share this life. Let's split one grain of sand into two. Hard, full of privation, but honest. No, I can't. Not then, and not now. Never. Look at me and tell me what you see. An old woman, a beast. - You're lying. Yes, okay. I see Alyssa. The unique one, the graceful one, the shining one. I only ever wanted to see that Alyssa. As if it's my own self. But then I see the Alyssa with worms in her face. The eerie one, the rotting one, the eternal one. And that's what you fear? Eternity? Your eternity! And the beast you are. Aren't you a beast yourself? Not anymore, and I'll never again be one. Not the one I was, and definitely not the one you are. Not even if my life depends on it. It will. - Anything else? You are the same Valdez. Nothing else. You can't flee from me, Valdez! My curse is your curse. I'll always find you. I know how the Valdez feels, I know. You just can't get rid of some things. Lacks some salt. Does he know where I got my leprosy from? Kissed the wrong woman. Once! Take me to the Torrid Waters. - Torrid Waters. Is he nuts, is he? Not nuts, cursed. Torrid Waters, truth or death, is he nuts, is he? No. The price is too high. He can't pay, not Valdez. Truth or death, and freed from every curse. I know the price. Do we have a deal? Torrid Waters. Is he nuts? He earned that in the tavern, I heard. In such a short time? Caramba, he must be a cheapskate. Not with you Frekno, if you help me. Frekno shouldn't do it. Not such a deal. Not with Valdez. He got a reason to hate Valdez? He does. Everyone does. Valdez is cursed. He's cursed because he knows Alyssa's secret. A piece of advice from Frekno. Surrender himself to Alyssa. Now. - Never. If he enters the Torrid Waters, he won't be able to come back. Why... ? - He won't. Vain Valdez, vain. If Frekno meets him again, and shall help... I won't do it. I'll betray the Valdez. Betray him. Just take me to the Torrid Waters. Frekno keeps his word. Frekno doesn't cheat. Vamos. He really wants to? Is he sure? Si. Then go. Go. You can't flee from me, Valdez. You are the same Valdez. I keep my word. Alyssa! Alyssa! The regent will be pleased. Si. A new delivery, mi capitan. Very nice creatures. This one you can kill right away. We already have enough antmen, they're a plague. And what is with these two? Do they know any legerdemains? Take this one to my laboratory, for my in vivo experiments. And whom do we have here? Good gracious. I have waited a long time for someone like him. The people will love him. He's perfect for tonights show. - Indeed. But first I want to try one of my gene preparations on him. He seems to be quite robust. Torrid Water. Alyssa. Alyssa. Alyssa! Alyssa! You can't seem to get rid of your blood mark, Valdez de Corazon. Like you can't escape the curse of the night. Like we can't escape each other. You've gone a long way, vain lion, but are still trapped in your dream. In the dream, yes. But no longer in jealousy. No longer in addiction and delusion. And also not in fear. I learned to listen to my heart. I feel every part of my being. I no longer stand in front of walls. Nor in front of mirrors. I stand in front of myself. Congratulations, you retained your tongue. I know it's difficult to forgive. Even more difficult to trust. To forgive you, that's easy. Because there's nothhing you ever gave me. But trusting you. Trust is worth nothing without faith. Or without hope. Pity you deserve. But if you're hoping for forgiveness, you hope for nothing. Too invidious were your words. Too lackluster your deftness. You are right. Once again. I was a victim of my own vanity. I'm no longer a guy to long for. Nevertheless, wasn't it I who found out about your secret? The bitter source of your power and your suffering? Don't I know it better than anyone else? And wasn't it you who pushed me. Further and further till the very end, be it salvation or bitter death? Once again, Alyssa, you are right. My curse is yours. We belong together. The fire you ignited has burned out. Our time is over. Once the last light disappears my curse will be renewed. You'll suffer a bitter death. A new eternity will begin. I... will have to wait for someone else. That's not true. It is. Finally I know Alyssa's secret too. And that even without putting a curse on myself. How clever of me. Valdez, you look awful. And Alyssa, you're a witch. What a nice couple. Get them out of here. Gomez! Alyssa! Alyssa! Your contenance, mi capitana, is remarkable. Proud like a lion, cold like a lizard. You may know my secret, Gomez, but you won't be able to use it. With all due respect, my beauty, but do you still believe that nowadays we still need sorcery or curses to achieve eternal youth? I will analyse your tissue, extract your genes and the new human will be finished. Or should I say, the new ruler. Strap her to the gene extraction table. Lorenzo. Wait, wait, don't be afraid, soon Gomez will come with the forceps. He will extract your best gene, and make himself beautiful again. Oh, an intermezzo. But a funny one if I'm not mistaken. My god, this is totally blurred. Valdez. Yes, right here. Do you like the new gadgetry in my palace? That's how San Vanidad is being ruled nowadays. I would've bet that the rats wouldn't let you live for long. Anyway, good luck on your way. Search for your way, amigo. Left or right, right or left. Keep going, keep going, Corazon. A mirror is not only good for looking at yourself. Here's a lady waiting for you. That was smart, mi Corazon. Now you're back where it all began. But you don't seem to be able to come forth. What could be the reason? Back to business, honey. Carlos. Rosita. Don't touch me, you stinky leprous creature. Don't you recognize me? It's me, Rafael. Enough, you mud face. Get out. Where's Lucia? Lucia! There's no Lucia here. Fuck off! - Lucia. You're alive. - Hey, stop. Don't you recognize me? It's me, Rafael. You had high fever and I told you a tale. What kind of tale was it? The tale about the condor and the lion. You're totally nuts. - Rafael. What happened? - It doesn't matter. Do you still want a revolution? Then it has to happen now. Gomez took Alyssa into his laboratory. To torture her. He can't do that. - He did it. How can we be sure that you're not lying? You have to believe me. I know the palace. I can lead you. Rafael knows the palace. Rafael. Come here, Rafael. Listen to me, amigos. Listen! Hey! He can lead us, he's right. The Rafael, is our Valdez. Idiotas. Don't you see the bloodstain, don't you? Now I recognize him, he's Valdez. He had a deal with me. There's only one man who can free Alyssa. And that's the Valdez. We want the revolution? We want it? Of course we want. - Then let him lead us. Let Valdez lead us. Yes, why not. We can make it if we all hold together. The wound is healing way too fast. Hurry, the scalpel. Scalpel. And you take this. Keep the wound open. Revolution. - What? Good grief, I can't work this way. For god's sake, get up, you cretin, you worm! And you, get out! I need time! Time! You stay. I need you. Come over here. Keep them away! I need time! Carlos, bad guys! Stop! Don't come any closer, muchachos. - The game is over, Gomez. Finito. We will see. You can't kill her. You can't even harm her. No curse is stronger than the Torrid Water. Don't care about me, Valdez. Kill him. Try it. Let's see how she'll look with a burn mark on her face. Open view to the gullet. Drop the weapons! Ahora! Kill him, Valdez! You were wrong about him, my beauty. Looks like he's really loving you. And now clear the way. Come on. Clear the way! Well, Valdez de Corazon, say gracias to the nearing salvation. Gracias. We made it. You are so silent, Valdez de Corazon. There's nothing more I could say. Only those who dare to love will win the love. Nobody else has ever won, except darkness and fear. The curse was over. All fear defeated, and all vanity. The hearts were free. Love could grow again, and with it beauty. Whatever she looks like.
