Lagring What is it? Where is Romina? She just left for Manila l fear the worst Lagring When l found out that it was Magda the snake. .. who was causing the murders l couldn?t believe it What do you mean? l know the family of Magda She was called Magda the snake... because she was supposedly cursed Cursed because she had the skin of the snake on her face and hands But the problem was not only in her appearance but also her brain She had the mind of a child even as she grew older Magda the snake! Curse of the snake! l couldn?t believe that she was responsible... for the incidents with Romina So who could it be? Do you know who? lt?s Melda, the twin of Magda They look very much alike when you cover... the affected half of the face of Magda But their parents found out that she was very evil She was always in fights, envious and imitates people. Her evil ways got worse when she noticed... that her parents loved her sister with the disorder more than she Melda actually tried to murder poor Magda many times What are you doing? I?m copying you so we look the same Come with me I have something to show you Melda! Melda! It?s coming! It?s coming! You have nowhere to run! Nowhere to hide! Nowhere else to go! Until now nobody knows what happened to the twin that night But Magda the snake was the one who was present... when Aileen and Romina did the spirit of the glass again l understand Lagring but we can?t say... if only one spirit answered their call Because in life and in death twins are always together l have to go to the comfort room Okay Why her?
