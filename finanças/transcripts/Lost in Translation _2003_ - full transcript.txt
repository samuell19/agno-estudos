Listen, I'm under Evelyn Waugh. - Oh, oh, oh. - Shh. Okay? Okay. Yeah. Okay, arigato, arigato. Evelyn Waugh? - What? - Evelyn Waugh was a man. Oh, come on. She's nice. What? You know... You know, not everybody went to Yale. It was just a pseudonym, for Christ's sake. Why do you have to defend her? Well, why do you have to point out how stupid everybody is all the time? I thought it was funny. Forget it. Well... Hey, John, we gotta go. Oh. Yeah. Bye. Did you ever wonder what your purpose in life is? This book is about finding your soul's purpose or destiny. Every soul has its path, but sometimes that path is not clear. The Inner Map Theory is an example of how each soul begins with an imprint, all compacted into a pattern that has been selected by your soul before you've even gotten here. You know, I guess the reason why I like Japan the best out of all Asian countries, is because I really feel close to Buddhism. I really feel... That's part of what drew me to Midnight Velocity as well, because although Keanu dies, he eventually gets reincarnated. So there's hope. There's hope in reincarnation, I think. What was it like working with Keanu Reeves? He was always so... He was always, you know, giving me ideas, and, you know, really helpful. He made me feel really comfortable, so... And we both have two dogs, and we both live in L.A., so we have all these different things in common. So, you know, we both really like Mexican food, and yoga and karate! Mexican food. Yoga. Hello. Hi. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. He got married a couple of times to some nice women. Beautiful women, too. I mean, you and I would be crazy for these women. But there were always rumors. I never liked his acting, so I never gave a damn whether he was straight or not. Thank you. Hi. Thanks. What can I get you? I'm not sure. For relaxing times, make it Suntory time. I'll have a vodka tonic. Thanks. So, what are you doing here? A couple of things. Taking a break from my wife, forgetting my son's birthday and getting paid $2 million to endorse a whisky when I could be doing a play somewhere. But the good news is, the whisky works. What are you doing? My husband's a photographer, so he's here working, and I wasn't doing anything, so I came along. And we have some friends that live here. How long have you been married? Thank you. Two years. Twenty-five long ones. You're probably just having a midlife crisis. Did you buy a Porsche yet? You know, I was thinking about buying a Porsche. Twenty-five years. That's a... Well, it's impressive. Well, you figure you sleep one-third of your life. That knocks off eight years of marriage right there. So you're down to 16 and change. You're just a teenager at marriage. You can drive it, but there's still the occasional accident. Yeah. What do you do? I'm not sure yet, actually. I just graduated last spring. What did you study? Philosophy. Yeah, there's a good buck in that racket. Yeah. Well, so far it's pro bono. Well, I'm sure you'll figure out the angles. Yeah. I hope your Porsche works out. Cheers to that? Cheers to that. Wish I could sleep. Me, too. One, two, three, and okay. All right. One, two, three, four. And one, two, three, four. And one, two... Wait! Take me with you! How'd it go? Oh, it was good, you know. I'm tired. Yeah, I gotta go downstairs and meet Kelly for some drinks. She wants to talk about some photo thing. Maybe I'll go downstairs with you. Oh, you wanna come? Yeah, sure. Okay. Yeah. You stepped out of a dream Everybody is always like, "Kelly, you are anorexic". And I'm like, "No, I'm not". I eat so much junk food, you wouldn't believe it. Just because I have a high metabolism. Because I thought you were anorexic, too. Everybody does. Everybody thinks that. Yeah, 'cause you look so... Thank you. I know, but it's... I mean, I eat whatever. I have a really high metabolism. - Yeah. - But... My dad is an anorexic. - Really? - Oh, really? Yeah. He fought on the American side of the Bay of Pigs in Cuba. He was taken prisoner, and the whole time he was there they tortured him about food. Every day they told him they put poison in the food. So they would always make themselves throw up after every meal. That's horrible. That's terrible. That's some crazy shit. - You don't think he sounds kind of goofy? - No. You know that break beat, right? Well, I been taking it to some next level shit. Like, I'll take that and put a delay on it, so it's like... So it's, like, evolving the beat. So it, like, sounds hella large on the track. You know what I'm saying? - No. - No? You don't listen to hip-hop? Oh, my God! You guys gotta listen. I tried this power cleanse. It's so amazing. Okay, promise me you'll try it. Will you try this power cleanse? - I did it last week, and it's amazing. - I'll be right back. It's so good to get the toxins out of your body. With all, like, the pollution, all, like, the... - Hello. - Hello. You ever switch seats? I like this one. If I fall, someone will notice. Yeah. So, you having a nice time? Can you keep a secret? I'm trying to organize a prison break. I'm looking for, like, an accomplice. We'd have to, first, get out of this bar. Then the hotel, then the city and then the country. Are you in, or are you out?
