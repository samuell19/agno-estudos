Announcer: GOOD MORNING. IT'S "EYE ON L.A." [ MUSIC PLAYS ] PHOTOGRAPHY, MODELING, AND PUMPING IRON -- ARE THEY COMBINING INTO A NEW KIND OF SOFT PORN? THIS MORNING, "EYE ON L.A." LOOKS INTO THIS PHENOMENON. THERE ARE THOSE LEGITIMATE PHOTOGRAPHERS, LIKE HARRY LANDIN, AND THEN THERE ARE THOSE PHOTOGRAPHERS RIGHT ON THE EDGE. WE'LL BE TALKING TO THE CONTROVERSIAL BOBBY KORSHACK, WHO'S HAD HIS LEGAL DIFFICULTIES IN THE PAST -- RUN-INS WITH THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES OVER FILMS HE CALLED "ART" AND OTHERS CALLED "OBSCENE." KORSHACK'S MAGAZINES HAVE HURT LEGITIMATE PUBLICATIONS. IN FACT, SOME HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM SUPERMARKET CHECKOUT COUNTERS BECAUSE OF THEIR COVERS. IS HE, AS HE SAYS, "GLORIFYING THE NEW FEMALE FORM, JUST LIKE ZIEGFELD," OR IS HE STILL, AS HE'S BEEN CALLED BY HIS DETRACTORS, "THE KING OF SLEAZE"? WE'LL BE HEARING FROM THE MODELS, THE AGENTS, THE PUBLISHERS. BUT FIRST, LET'S MEET THE ALWAYS-CONTROVERSIAL BOBBY KORSHACK. OKAY, MR. KORSHACK, YOU'RE CONSIDERED BY SOME AS THE "KING OF PORN." HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN DOING THIS? Bobby: I'VE BEEN, UH -- I'VE BEEN INTO IT FOR ABOUT THREE YEARS. UH-HUH. HAS IT BEEN PROFITABLE SO FAR? I ALWAYS DO WELL. OH, I SEE. MR. KORSHACK, THIS FASHION OF FEMALE MUSCLE-BUILDING -- HOW PREVALENT DO YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO BECOME? I THINK IT'S THE NEW WAVE. I THINK IT'S AN ERA THAT'S WORLDWIDE. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. IT DEALS WITH HEALTH. NOW, I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT YOU AND MANY OTHER MEN... WHAT THE FUCK? OH! UH-HUH. MR. KORSHACK, YOU KNEW WE'D BE GETTING AROUND TO THIS EVENTUALLY. IT'S NO SECRET YOU'VE HAD PROBLEMS IN THE PAST WITH, UH, SHALL WE SAY -- WELL, SOME VERY SEXUALLY EXPLICIT PHOTOGRAPHIC WORK. DO YOU REGRET ANY OF THAT NOW? NO, I SEE GROWTH. I ACTUALLY DO. I MEAN, WE ALL COME FROM SOMEWHERE, AND I'VE TRIED A LOT OF DIFFERENT AVENUES. I'M NOT ASHAMED OF WHAT I'VE DONE, AND, UH, I'M PROUD OF WHAT I AM DOING NOW. UM, TO EXPAND ON THAT A LITTLE BIT, I, UH -- I'VE TRIED A LOT OF DIFFERENT AVENUES IN ACTING... WAIT A MINUTE. ...FOR MY FRIENDS, PRIMARILY. NONE OF THIS STUFF WAS RELEASED... HEY!

HAVE I EVER DENIED YOU ANYTHING? STAY HERE. HA HA HA HA HA. I'LL BE BACK. VIVECA. HAVE YOU SEEN THE PAPER YET TODAY? NO, I PICKED UP A COPY AT THE AIRPORT, BUT HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO READ IT. YEAH, JACKY REACHED ME IN TOKYO. ABOUT AN 88-HOUR TIME DIFFERENCE, BUT YOU KNOW JACKY WHEN HE WANTS TO DO SOMETHING. HE SPOKE TO YOU? WELL, I ASSUMED HE'D ALREADY SPOKEN TO YOU. SPOKEN TO ME? ISN'T THAT WHY YOU'RE HERE? WHY? WE WORKED IT OUT TOGETHER, HE AND I, BEFORE I LEFT FOR TOKYO LAST MONDAY. MONDAY? WELCOME BACK, MR. HURLEY. THANK YOU. MESSAGES CAN WAIT, MISS ROSE. YES, MR. HURLEY. IT'S JUST A SIMPLE MATTER OF FORMALIZING WHAT'S BEEN THE DE FACTO TRUTH BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU FOR SOME TIME NOW. YOU DO WANT ME TO HANDLE IT, DON'T YOU? UM... WHAT IS THERE TO HANDLE? THE DIVORCE. WHAT ELSE? NOTHING ELSE. THAT'S THE WOMAN. THE BLONDE. ARE YOU SURE? YEAH. WELL... NOT TO SWEAR IN COURT. I HEARD HER YELLING, AND THEN I JUST CAUGHT A QUICK LOOK AT HER AS SHE RAN DOWN THE HALL. WHAT WAS SHE YELLING? SHE WAS THREATENING SOMEBODY. WHAT WAS SHE THREATENING TO DO? IT WAS MORE RANTING AND RAVING. SHE WAS DRUNK. I WOULDN'T SAY -- WELL, SHE COULD HAVE BEEN. DID YOU EVER SEE HER BEFORE? DID SHE VISIT THAT SECOND-FLOOR APARTMENT OFTEN? NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE. THAT'S HOW I PUT IT TO THE POLICE. ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU. OH... YOU'RE LOCKING YOUR CAT OUT. I WOULDN'T OWN A CAT. WHOSE LITTLE CAT ARE YOU, BLUE EYES? HEY! I'LL LOOK IN ON YOU IN JUST A FEW MINUTES. * CAN'T GET ENOUGH * * YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FACE IT * * YOU'RE ADDICTED TO LOVE * * MIGHT AS WELL FACE IT * * YOU'RE ADDICTED TO LOVE * * MIGHT AS WELL FACE IT * * YOU'RE ADDICTED TO LOVE * WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN? CHANGE MY LOOKS, WILL YOU? * MIGHT AS WELL FACE IT * * YOU'RE ADDICTED TO LOVE * * MIGHT AS WELL FACE IT * * YOU'RE ADDICTED TO LOVE... * IT'S A MISTAKE. WHAT ABOUT COLOR? NATURAL. GIVE ME A HINT. SOME KIND OF BROWN. WHAT? WHAT IS IT? COME ON, JACKY! I TALKED TO HURLEY. HE MUST HAVE CALLED YOU. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. YES, I DO. THAT'S WHAT'S SAD. IT DOESN'T EVEN HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE JAM I'M IN. HE SAID YOU TALKED TO HIM A WEEK AGO. HE DID? YOU COULDN'T COME TO ME? WE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A FIGHT. YOU HAD TO GO TO A FUCKING LAWYER? HE'S YOUR LAWYER, TOO, ALEX. WAS MY LAWYER. YOU HAVE ALL THE BUSINESS NOW. IT'S JUST LEGAL SHIT. I'M GOING PUBLIC. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS? SELLING STOCK. SO? IT GETS COMPLICATED. IT'S NOT SO COMPLICATED. YOU MET SOMEBODY, DIDN'T YOU? ANYBODY I KNOW? ISABEL HARDING. YOU'RE KIDDING. NO. HARDING? AS IN PASADENA? BEL-AIR. I LOVE HER ANYWAY. IS SHE A CLIENT? SOMETIMES YOU DO HER IN HER HOME? ONCE IN A WHILE. BEAUTIFUL PLACE, HUH? BEAUTIFUL ENOUGH, YEAH. ALL THAT MONEY. I GOT MONEY. AH, BUT WITH THE HARDINGS, IT'S SO MUCH MORE. THERE'S ALL THAT BREEDING. IS THAT IT? ALL THAT EARLY AMERICAN STUFF? I DON'T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT ALL THAT EARLY AMERICAN STUFF, BUT IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, UM... CLOUT... YEAH. SURE, JACKY. YOU'VE BEEN ON THE OUTSIDE LONG ENOUGH, HUH? NOW YOU WANT IN? I WANT IN. RIGHT. JOAQUIN MANERO. YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT. AREN'T YOU AFRAID OF BEING BORED TO DEATH? NOT A BIT. WELL, SHE'S PROBABLY NO MORE BORING THAN THE REST OF US. YES, SHE IS. [ CRYING ] HEY, TURNER! YOU MOVING TO L.A.? OH, I'M THINKING ABOUT IT. HOW YOU BEEN, SERGEANT? BAKERSFIELD'S A LONG COMMUTE. OH, I'M NOT WITH THEM ANYMORE. WHAT BRINGS YOU DOWN HERE? HOMICIDE. WHAT ELSE? THE KORSHACK THING. DOESN'T RING A BELL. I'M SURPRISED. WHY'S THAT? WELL, IT MADE THE NEWS. THE DECEASED BOBBY KORSHACK HAD A LITTLE SOMETHING TO DO WITH DIRTY PICTURES OR ART, DEPENDING UPON HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT NAKED LADIES. THE PRIME SUSPECT IS KNOWN TO US...AS THEY SAY. WELL, YOU GUYS ARE GOOD. WELL, WE GOT SOME PROBLEMS -- WHERE HE WAS KILLED, THE BODY WAS MOVED. THE PLACE WAS CLEANED UP, SO THERE'S NO BLOOD, NO WEAPONS, NO SIGNS OF VIOLENCE. I'M TALKING ABOUT THE KIND OF CLEANING MY WIFE WOULD GO CRAZY TO FIND SOMEBODY TO DO FOR US. JUST A STRAND OF HAIR... NOT KORSHACK'S. WHAT COLOR? BLOND. A REAL BLOND? WHO KNOWS THESE DAYS? ALSO, COULD HAVE CAME FROM A WIG. WELL, THE LAB WILL TELL YOU THAT. YOU WERE WASTED UP THERE IN BAKERSFIELD, TURNER. SHE'S STILL AT LARGE. WHO'S THAT? THE PRIME SUSPECT... ACTUAL MOVIE STAR... VIVECA VAN LOREN. SHE SHOULD BE EASY TO FIND. SHE'S BEEN QUICK, BUT I'M GOING TO GIVE HER 24 HOURS ANYWAY. WHY IS THAT? ON THE OUTSIDE CHANCE SHE DIDN'T DO IT. SOMEBODY OUT THERE KNOWS SHE DIDN'T. NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN, HERB. SAME HERE. TAKE CARE OF YOUR KITTY, TURNER. CHARLIE, PULL RECORDS. LET ME CHECK ON A COP, PROBABLY EX-COP, OUT OF BAKERSFIELD, RETIRED, FIRED, OR DISABLED.

I'M OKAY. I GOT A PLACE. WHERE? A GUY. HE'S GOT AN APARTMENT, SORT OF. WHO -- FRANKIE? NO, A GUY I MET BY ACCIDENT. IT'S OKAY, JACKY. YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW. JUST STAY OUT OF IT. [ CAT MEOWS ] ALEXANDRA? YOU CAN'T TRUST SOME GUY YOU MET IN A BAR, ALEX. IT WAS THE AIRPORT. WHEREVER. WHAT DOES HE WANT? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? NOTHING. WHAT WAS HE DOING THERE? SEEING HIS DAUGHTER OFF. DID YOU SEE HIS KID? NO, BUT SHE -- HE KNOWS I'M INNOCENT. SO DO I. BUT NO, NOT BECAUSE HE'S MY FRIEND. HE SAW THERE WASN'T A BODY IN THE SHOWER, AND THEN THERE WAS. AND THEN THERE WAS. HE PUT IT THERE. NO. WHO ELSE COULD HAVE, AND SO EASY? YOU WERE PASSED OUT, AM I RIGHT? IT WAS WHEN I WAS TALKING TO YOU ON THE PHONE. HE WAS THERE, WASN'T HE? YES. AND DID HE KNOW WHERE KORSHACK WAS? WILL YOU CALL HURLEY? FIRST THING IN THE MORNING. YOU'LL BE OKAY HERE FOR NOW. YOU KNOW WHERE EVERYTHING IS. AND WILL YOU STAY HERE WITH ME? I HAVE A DINNER DATE. THE HARDINGS? I'LL COME BACK IN AN HOUR, AN HOUR AND A HALF. THEY GO TO BED LIKE BABIES. HEY, I'LL BRING ISABEL. OH, THAT'LL BE NICE. MAYBE SHE KNOWS, YOU KNOW, A TOUGHER LAWYER, TOUGHER THAN HURLEY. YOU KNOW THE KIND -- GENTLEMEN-LOOKING, BUT A REAL KILLER FOR HIS CLIENT. WANT ME TO TURN ON THE TUB? OH, NO. UNH-UNH. TAKE A REST, BABE, OKAY? FORGET ABOUT EVERYTHING.

WHERE IS HE -- JACKY? WITH YOUR PAL HERBIE. HAVE THEY GOT ENOUGH ON HIM? I DON'T KNOW. MISS HARDING SAYS HE KILLED KORSHACK, AND HE SAYS SHE DID IT. BYE-BYE, JACKY. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WELL, WHO DO YOU THINK THEY'RE GOING TO BELIEVE, HER, OR SOME... SOME GUY NAMED JOAQUIN MANERO? WHO DO YOU BELIEVE? I THINK SHE DID IT. I THINK THEY'LL... PUT HIM AWAY, AND I THINK SHE'LL DO A LITTLE TIME OR NONE. I THINK THAT'S THE WAY IT IS. IT'S A BITCH. CAN YOU GET ME SOME WATER HERE? OH, UH... WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? WHEN? WELL, YOU KNOW. I DON'T KNOW YET. WORK? WAIT FOR YOU TO GET SPRUNG. THAT'S A NICE THOUGHT, BUT... ALL WE KNOW ABOUT EACH OTHER IS A DAY AND A HALF ON THE RUN, SOMEBODY TRYING TO KILL US. BRINGS PEOPLE TOGETHER -- MAYBE A GOOD WAY TO START. HELL, THE REST WILL BE LIKE SUNDAY ON THE FARM. WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT A FARM? WELL... I HAVE GREAT HOPES FOR YOU, ALEXANDRA. WHAT ABOUT FOR US?
