Scared the hell out of me. I'm sorry, Miss Ebony. I didn't mean to scare you. Do I know you, miss? Glenda. Glenda Shaw. I live two houses down from Mr. Lewis. From who? Mr. Lewis. The man you've been taking pictures of for the past 10 minutes. Well ma'am, not that it's any of your business, but I'm working here. Well, as the neighborhood watch block captain, it is my business. And you ain't fooling nobody in that get up. I knew it was you from the car. So, how can I help you, Miss Glenda? Well, I have a personal issue. It's my daughter, Ny'Kia. She done ran off with this grown ass man. Uh uh. You need to call the cops for that. I don't do missing children. Only insurance fraud. Hm. And you spying on Mr. Lewis? Gerald is one of the nicest old men I know in the world. He wouldn't even hurt a fly. Sure wouldn't scam nobody. I'm sorry. I just can be really protective of him sometimes. What is that he's tacking on a trees anyway? Oh. Wow. I didn't know. Is this his daughter? It's his niece Tabby. Tabby and my daughter, they best friends. Thing is I know where my daughter is. Tabby been missing for the past three months. Were the girls together when they went missing? You know, they could have been, but I can't get in touch with Ny'Kia to find out. She with that Truth man. He's the devil. A false prophet. What Truth man? That fake ass, wannabe be preacher. Quote, unquote, thug rapper. He be carrying on and Lord knows what else. You mean Caleb Truth? Mm hm. That devil. He got a perverse thing for young girls. How old is your daughter? My baby is 16 years old. She don't know her ass from a hole in the ground, but somehow he convinced her to be with him and there she went off with him. Here, here's her picture. So, you telling me a grown ass man convinced your 16 year old daughter to come and live with him and you ain't call the cops on his ass? No, you don't understand.

They all in Caleb Truth's pocket. Even the good ones it seems. No, I'm pretty sure Wayne is not, but I understand. Well, I know you busy investigating, so I'll let you go. You have a blessed day, but don't forget about me, Miss Ebony. I won't, Miss Glenda. And you, too. Hey, Mr. Mark. Hey Ebony. You know there's different ways to see me, right? You don't gotta keep sending these packages to my house. You can come over whenever you want. Now, Mr. Mark, if you want to bring my packages by, I ain't gon' be mad at you, but I done told you 50 times that you too old for me. Girl, please. We're about the same age. Hey, I got some of that Balmain vodka that you like. How 'bout you come over a little later? Have little nightcap? Mr. Mark. I like my man much, much younger than you. Ah, baby. Why you got to do me like that? Oh, that's right, that's right. You're one of them cougars. You like them young bucks. Only thing those cats are good for are fucking like jack rabbits all night. So what's wrong with all night passion? Shit, nothing. I just got to get to work in the morning. I ain't as good as I once was, but I'm real good once at least. Okay, now you just doing the most. You need to slow down, boy. Slow his roll. Boy, you a fool. Look. Bye, Mr. Mark. All right then. I'll let you get back to your thirsty little boyfriends. Yo, Eb? I know you live in the suburbs and shit, but you need to lock your door. Anybody can walk up in here. Right. I live in the suburbs where people wait for an answer before coming into people's cribs because otherwise they get shot. Who gonna shoot me? Mark? That's my buddy. We just had a shot of vodka before I walked up in here. I just bet y'all did. You brought me dinner, Cal? You know, I know you can't cook. I don't cook. There's a difference. Don't cook, can't cook. Same damn thing to me. And since we ain't get to have breakfast yesterday 'cause you wanted to walk off caking with that little cougar cub, figured I'd treat you to a little dinner. What? Deontae?

You want to see his picture? Nope, I'm good. Mm hm. Look, look, look. His dick bigger than yours. Oh, so we comparing dick pics now? Shit, I got you. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. He's a multi golden platinum selling artist, both in the hardcore world of gangster rap and Christian gospel rap. He's a newly ordained pastor at the soon to be built million dollar mega church, the First Truth Fellowship and now a bestselling author. Here to talk about everything in his new book, "The Audacity of Truth." Wait, did you hear that? They said Caleb Truth wrote a book. I didn't even think this fool could read. Yeah man, that's my dog. Yo, I'm really digging that new gospel single he put out called Church. Church? Yeah, but you got to say it like church without the R. Mm hm. I can't. I can't. I can't with him. But I had an interesting conversation today with this lady about this fool. Uh uh, Eb. Caleb Truth really is the truth. You should hear what all that stuff he went through and that was before he went to prison for five years. What'd he go to prison for? Strong armed robbery and kidnapping one of his eight baby mamas. Damn. Yup. Then he went to prison, somehow found God, and came out a preacher. He's still rapping about the streets and all that, but yo, he could be real in the name of God, man. Does he now? Please. Answer the phone, please. Dear God, please mama, answer. Lookie here. In the name of God, I'd smash you through this wall real hard. It'll hurt. Who you calling anyway, Ny'Kia? I'm sorry, Caleb. I didn't mean that. I just miss my mama. Keep crying and on your mommy and mine, you're gonna end up like your girl, down on all fours and out of time, you heard? Do you really love, believe and trust me? I mean, are you loyal enough for the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? So help you? Me? Yes. Yes, what? Yes, God Daddy. That's right. I'm your god and your daddy. Your mama and grand papi. So what you need your mama for when I'm the one that got you, ho? Ain't that what you told me, Kia? - Yes, but. - Ain't no buts. Except for yours in the audience. Now go on and fix your face. Looking like a damn disgrace. Hey Caleb. They're ready. They're ready for you, Caleb. He's a multi golden platinum selling artist, both in the hardcore world of gangster rap and Christian gospel rap. He's a newly ordained pastor at the soon to be built million dollar mega church, the First Truth fellowship, and now a bestselling author. Here to talk about everything in his new book, "The Audacity of Truth" please welcome to the "Vonda Watkins Show", the undisputed Caleb Truth. Wow. As you would say, lookie here, right? I see that no matter where you go that people love you, Caleb, right? That's right. Lookie here, Vonda. The people love the God in me and I love them back whole heartedly. Negro, please. That's blasphemy. So, as you discuss in your book, "The Audacity of Truth," tell me about the exact moment that made you change your lifestyle from all of the sex, drugs, and violence you craved in your gangster rap persona and become a pastor. Lookie here, Vonda. I grew up hard on the streets. It was four of us brothers. We ain't never have enough to eat. See, my mama was a hooker and my daddy was a fiend. I started slaying bags of reefer by the age of 13. By the time I hit my 20s, I was popping pills with him. Still stacking up my paper flying weight in from Jamaica. Caught my first case on my 22nd birthday. In the pen I got in with some gangsters out of L.A. My nigga talk upon it it's 'cause at 40, yo, hit me to the rap game and made myself a studio. Ugh, if he says lookie here, Vonda, one more time. I can't. Okay, I'm good on this ghetto Dr. Seuss. I'm going to my room to set this new cub straight 'cause he's getting a bit too pushy. Man, quit hating, Eb. I told you this man the truth. The truth will set you free, Eb. No, Cal, the truth will set you up. This fool is a lie and the truth ain't in him. Man, bye. Whatever, move. I see I'm gon' have to break down my rules to you, but let's video chat because it's too much to text. Hey, sexy lady. Okay, little baby. Let me explain this, okay, so you don't get it twisted while we talking, okay? Oh, I like a lady that gets down to biz. First cougar commandment. Let's be honest why we're here, okay? Dick loves pussy. Pussy loves dick. We each have the counterpart. Moving on. Second. Keep your cool. I'm talking about cooler than Sammy Davis Jr. Sipping a slushy in Siberia cool. Who? Cooler than Snoop Dogg then. All right. Number three. Eb, come quick. Number three. I don't come quick. I come hard. Hold on. Girl, I'm on the phone. My bad. My home girl keeps bothering me about some bullshit on the Vonda show. You talking about the Caleb Truth interview? I'm watching it, too. Why? That guy is a whole clown. Like why does he rhyme everything? That would get on my nerves real quick. That's just his thing, ma. He reaches a lot of people with his music. Me included. Matter of fact, I got my meet and greet VIP this weekend. Hm. Well, why don't you get me a ticket, too, and I'll be your escort for the evening? Do I get a happy ending with your services? Well that's totally up to you. Ooh, you know I would, ma, but tickets sold out about an hour after I got mine. I mean, how 'bout you come back afterwards? Eb, he gone be at the art gallery on. Oh, nevermind. It's invite only. Once again, I apologize for the interruptions. Like I was saying. You was saying I get to see that sexy grown ass woman body on top of mine tomorrow night. No, I wasn't, which brings me to number four. Quit being so damn pushy. If it's meant for you, you'll get it, and stop asking me for nudes. Ladies don't like that. Everybody does that. Ladies, too. You need to let me dust them granny panties off so you won't be so feisty. You saw that shower pic I sent you? All right, don't let your mouth write a check your ass can't cash. You are so sexy when you're fussing. I'm dead ass serious. Eb. Okay. Look, I'm gon' have to call you back. Okay. Better call me back. I get crazy when I'm ignored. Okay, I will, bye. Girl. What in the actual hell do you want, girl? Man, don't you know somebody who can get us in that Caleb Truth party? No, I don't and I wouldn't go to that. Hey. Guess who's working the Caleb Truth party tomorrow night at the gallery? Man, how you gon' call and brag about something we all can't go to? I'm only going because my job is catering the event. That and to meet my future ex-husband. Girl, this event gon' be lit. Wait. Can you get us tickets? Nobody can get tickets, girl. They sold out. You know what? Let me make a phone call and I'll hit you back. Spit. Man, if we can get in that spot, G. You know what? Deontae said he was going to that. Wait, wait, wait. Rewind that, rewind that. It's live TV, G. I can't. I know that girl. Who? The dreamy eyed one they just showed drooling over Caleb? That's Miss Glenda's daughter Ny'Kia. Who's Miss Glenda? This lady I met today while I was at work. She said that Caleb had her daughter under his spell or something like that. She'd been trying to call her and she not answering. Well there she is on national TV looking stuck. Cal, she's only 16 years old and he a grown man. You don't see nothing wrong with that? Eb, I know you ain't that naive. That little girl probably fast as hell and know more than me and you put together and we worked at a strip club. She want to be grown, shit, let her. She'll find out what to do sooner or later. Cal, that don't make it right. It ain't right or wrong, Eb. It's just life. What up? Look y'all, I'm on break so real quick. I got good news and bad. Good news is I got y'all in the spot tomorrow night. Bad news is, y'all gotta work the catering crew. Oh, hell no. It's the only way I could do it, Ebony, dang. My boss will act cool as hell though, but he said he can't pay y'all, but whatever you make in tips, you keep. Oh, hell no 'cause I ain't no waitress. It's the only way we can go, Eb. Come on. You even said it yourself, who would pay to go there? This way we ain't got to pay. They paying us to be there. Okay, I guess. All right, cool. Y'all just wear a white shirt, black pants, and sensible shoes. Oh, and be there by 6:45. The fun starts at seven. See, I didn't tell Jorge about hiring his no English speaking cousins. Hey, Louis, you about to lose your job, comprende muchacho? Well, look y'all my break's over, so I'll see y'all tomorrow night. Oh, this is gonna be like old times. Us all working together again. Yeah, except y'all ain't working the poles and I ain't working the door. Thank you, boo. We appreciate you. Kisses. Oh, Lord, she crazy. Look. So, don't tell her I'm planning on working because you know I'm on a mission, right? Eb, you know you can work any room you walk into. And what she mean by sensible shoes? Not those. Hey Miss Glenda, it's Ebony. Oh, hi baby. Everything good? Yes, ma'am. I'm just calling to get you a heads up to let you know I saw Ny'Kia on TV last night. I know. The whole neighborhood been talking about it. At least I know she's okay. I'm on my way to Caleb Truth's book signing party. No promises, but I'll let you know what I find out. Thank you, Miss Ebony. Anything would be greatly appreciated. Be safe and have a good night. You too, Miss Glenda. Just make sure you get that out. Take this out. Make sure we have that. No water. Hey y'all. Now I know I told this bitch sensible shoes. Girl, these are my sensible shoes. I got them on sale as a matter of fact. Yeah, I meant like flats or black sneakers. Them gon' hurt.

Don't worry about it, Felicia, I got this. Hot damn, girl. You can have my whole paycheck. Woo. Okay. Do not touch the art. Do not ask Mr. Truth for an autograph unless you buy the book.

No, no. Look. Ny'Kia, if Caleb did anything to you and your friend, you gotta tell somebody. You cannot let him get away with this bullshit. Miss Ebony, I don't want him to get in trouble. I can't leave here. I love him. Baby, that's not love. That's fear. You can leave him and I'll help you. No, you can't. Nobody leaves God Daddy. Tabby tried. Then okay look. Wait here. Here's my card. I'm not gonna push you to do anything. When you ready to go, you call me, okay? And I'll help you.

Bye, Lil Dub. Bye, Ebony. Yo, Eb. How 'bout Caleb offered me a job? A job doing what? I'ma be his valet. I get the keys to the personal car, too. ROG. When this happen? After his performance. He said he liked my energy, gave me three stacks, and asked me to join his crew as his valet. So, he gave you $3,000 just like that? Just like that. Hm. Maybe you can help me get Ny'Kia out of there. What? Nah, I ain't touching that. Come on, Cal. She's alone there. But Eb, that ain't my business. I'm trying to get paid and obviously she wants to be there. What girl wouldn't? I mean it's Caleb Truth. Shoot, if I was straight, I'd be on it, too. There's plenty of girls that wouldn't want to be abused by some sick perv using his clout to control and manipulate them. You tripping. No, you tripping. Can't believe that you even took this job from this creep. Why are you hating so hard on Caleb? It's not like I'm 'bout to marry the dude. Damn, it's just a job, Eb. I can't believe you sold your soul for some money. What? Hey, G, I don't know where all this hate is coming from, but I gotta get up and meet Caleb at his crib at 6:00 a.m. I'll holla. Cal? You take this job, don't even bother. - Yeah, I said it. - Oh, it's like that? Yeah, it's like that. After everything, it's like that? It's like that. Aight, well fuck you then. - No, fuck you, Cal. - No, fuck you, Eb. - No, fuck you. - Fuck you. Some bullshit. Fuck you. No, fuck you. Uh uh. Deontae got some nerve. Let me set his young ass straight right now. Yo, what's up? You reached Deontae. Leave me a message and I'll get back with you. Okay, so you really need to quit playing games. You could of gave me that damn ticket 'cause I know for a fact you wasn't there last night, so you need to get your lies together, honey. 'Cause this is a grown ass woman. Hello? Good morning, mama. Good morning, Lil Dub. Still sexy. Thinking about you all night. Oh yeah? Good thoughts I hope. Some good and some real nasty, but they was good though. Oh really now? I was thinking about grabbing a little grub this morning. How 'bout me and you have a little breakfast in bed? See where this day takes us. Hm. Well, that sounds enticing. Who bed we breakfasting in? What you mean? I'll be in my bed. Got this California king. So comfy, you ain't ever gonna wanna leave. And where you stay? Stay at the crib. At your mama's house? Nah, nah. It's Caleb's crib. Hm. Okay. Oh, shit. Really? Hell yeah. This place is like a palace. I can't wait to show you around. Oh and I can't wait to see it. I'm gonna go get fresh and clean real quick and then I'm gonna come scoop you in about an hour. Cool? Yeah, I'm down but can I meet you there? Aight, sexy. I'm gonna go scoop the grub and then I'll text the address. See you soon, all right? Okay, boo. See you. Ow. Yup, just what I needed. Sleeping pills. I ain't even let you hit it yet and look how you acting. That's a damn shame. Good morning. Hey, I wasn't expecting you to respond so fast. Kind of felt like you've been ignoring me. No, I just been super busy with this work case. I was gonna call you this weekend. Hey, what do you know about Caleb Truth? Oh, not a whole lot. He's got a new gospel album and it's not as blasphemous as I thought it was gonna be, but he's got some nice tracks on there. No, I mean, what have you heard about him? Like what nefarious shit is he into? To be honest, Ebony, I really haven't heard anything about him since he got out of prison. He seems to be on the up and up with this new church he's building. I heard he's been working with the mayor trying to start some youth programs. Youth programs, huh? Yeah, he's donated money to schools, some other churches, and even to the police fund. Yeah. Anything to keep the masses blinds to the bullshit. Wayne. I know for sure that this is not a good guy. I can't tell you all the details, but just trust me on this one. See, there you go. There I go what? I'm serious. This dude is bad news. Every time you don't like the answer or you don't get the answer you want, you have to create some new ones instead of just letting things happen the way they supposed to happen. What does that even mean, Wayne? Okay, like with this alleged information you have on Caleb Truth. I mean, the guy seems like he's at least trying to do better with his life, but here you come. You don't agree with his lifestyle or his message and you create your own idea of him and that from my experience is usually wrong. That's not true, Wayne. I give everybody the benefit of the doubt until proven otherwise. Oh, yeah? Like you gave our marriage the benefit of the doubt when you accused me of cheating and it was you all along. What are you talking about? We got a divorce because you made detective and you were spending all those hours with your female partner. I mean at the time, I may have been a bit jealous because you spent more time with her than you did with me. You was never there for me. But somebody was there, right? You never gave me the benefit even though I was busting my ass in overtime, so you didn't have to work at that club anymore. And I told you that Kathy was married with four kids, but that didn't matter to you. I lost the love of my life and you lost another man's baby and that's the real reason we got divorced. Isn't it? Wow. I mean, wow. I didn't know you knew that. It's my job to detect when something isn't right. I know when you're not being right with me and as your friend, I don't have that worry on me. We don't have an intimate connection anymore. We don't? I know I moved on. I had to. Later on after we broke up, I realized there were things I could never give you the way I really wanted to. Like first was a family, and then second was, you know, my time. I mean we discussed having kids and all of that. Yeah, but realistically it would have been a mistake. You would have been miserable all alone with those kids because of my schedule. You know, sometimes I think you cheating on me saved us. From what? From becoming enemies. At least now we're still friends and in each other's lives, but in a good way most of the time. But we'll always be friends, right? I hope so. Okay, look. I'm on a mission this morning so I'll call you back, okay? Oh, I see. One of your little play dates, huh? You know, I saw you with that boy you were flirting with over at Felicia's. Oh, he crazy. I'm gon' have to put him on ice for a minute. Whatever. Just call me when you're done with your so-called mission. I will, hon. And Wayne? Yeah? We would have had a beautiful family. I know, mami. I know. Hey, boo. How you doing? I'm good. This is it. This is nice. Told you. This is one of the masters. - Wow. - Nice, ain't it? This is real nice. Hey, mama. If a kiss make me shiver like that, I can't imagine what that thing do. Don't you want to eat first before the food gets cold? That's what they make microwaves for. Look at all these eggs, sausage, bacon, toast. No jelly. We got pancakes, too. Come on, go and eat it. I don't eat pancakes. Too many carbs, hon. I would like toast actually. All right. Got just the thing for you. I'll bring you back some jelly. Be right back. I found some. Here we go. This is grape. I don't like grape. Anything but, actually. Aight. Now you playing. I'm not. All right, I'll go back and see if I can find something else. Thanks, hon. That would be so sweet. I'll be back before that food gets cold. Believe that. Hey, I got the goods, man. Oh, that will be good. You know what would go good with this orange juice? What's that? Some vodka. Yeah. I like your style, baby. Got some just top shelf right there. Okay. See it? Let's get you right then. Not too much, not too much. I don't know about you, but I'm 'bout to get loose. Yeah. Yeah, here we go. Ah. Woo. Woo. Yeah. That's what I'm talking about, baby. Woo. I think I could fall in love with you. Mm mm. Slow down, tiger. You never heard of love at first sight? I don't believe in fairy tales. I live in the real world. Besides, I don't even know your real name. I know your mama ain't name you Lil Dub. Nah, my mama named me Damien Lavelli. See, my daddy was half Italian. Keep that on the low. I don't tell everybody about my government like that. That would explain your nice hair. Anyone else here? I mean, we alone but we ain't alone, alone. Ain't nobody coming in here if that's what you're worried about. Caleb is here, right? Nah. Him and that gay girl, they left this morning to run some errands. But some security guards running around here. They in they rooms. Probably with a couple other females. Ain't no telling. Hm, okay. So, you gonna come over here and let me see what that bad ass body do. I swear for Lord you got on some I wanna beat. Shit. Okay. I will. You just gotta be patient. I need to use the bathroom first. Well you are in luck. Got one right in here. Oh, okay. Damn it. Damn it. Shit. What? God. I know we don't talk much, but please let me get Ny'Kia outta here before Caleb gets back. And 86 Deontae 'cause he's nuts. Bam, baby. You got it. What's wrong, Onyx? I hate my life. What, what happened? Somebody try to get freaky in the champagne room? I just hate men. I think I wanna try women from now on. Girl, don't let Cal hear you say that. And besides, who gonna pay your bills? I'm sure I can find some rich old white lady for that. Or Cal. I know she got a thing for me. Or you can get it for yourself. Everybody's not as strong as you, Eb. I mean, you don't even have a pimp. And I don't need one, hon. Because all dancers are not hoes. Why walk around half naked and work hard for some clown to slap me around, take my money whenever he feels like it. Nah, you and Felicia can have that shit. Yeah, well, my pimp ain't nowhere near as crazy or broke as Black Ron. I mean, Felicia should be pimping him out. She makes all the bread, huh? No, shit. But I did hear he had a big dick though. Look, he can make some bread on the side. Some cake and some muffins too if he packing like that. Onyx, you got sick? It's not mine, Eb. Some dumb, drunk, stupid motherfucker puked on me while I was giving him a lap dance. I should have robbed his ass and put a root on him while his friends was helping him up off the floor. For your troubles at least, right? Right. I knew you'd understand. See? That's why you're my girl, Eb. No judgment, just realness. If anything ever happens to me, I know who I'm calling first 'cause I know you're coming. And you right. Just don't call me collect. Lil Dub? Damien? Thank you, thank you, thank you. Uh uh. You can thank me when we get outta here. Come on, let's go. Uh uh, you cannot take those bags. But these are all my clothes and shoes. Girl, you could be the flyest corpse or you can live to shop another day. Let's go. Okay, you ain't have to say it like that. Can I at least take my Kate Hamptons? I love these shoes. - Can you run in those? - Yes. Well, let's go. Shit. What the fuck she doing here? Thanks for the lift, Cal. Here's a little gift, pal. Thanks, Caleb. Lil Dub must have some company because that little coop don't belong to me. Thanks for hooking me up, Tiff. For you, I got a special gift. A special gift for me, God Daddy? I wonder what that could be. You gon' find out real soon. Cal, I'm gonna be busy til' the afternoon. Aight, what you want me to do 'til then? Go for a swim, shoot some hoops in the gym. Just don't take or break nothing and you'll fit right in. Aight, bet. Damn, Eb. What the actual fuck, man? Look I told you I was gonna rescue her with or without you. How'd y'all even get in the house? Lil Dub, but that's not important. Shit, well if Caleb catches us, it's curtains for everybody. Okay, well move out the way. He's outside right now with some girl. - What girl? - Bitch. He brought another girl to the crib? Yes. They're out in front right now, man. Y'all wait right here a minute. Damn. Bitch, you worried about the wrong thing. Say baby, why don't you go inside and have a seat? I'll be back in a heartbeat. You thought it would be that easy to leave me? Please Caleb, let me go. You wanna go like Tabby did? 'Cause that's the only way outta here, kid. Lookie here. What do you know? It's the old snapper from the gallery show. Who brought this bitch to my house? I said, who brought this bitch to my house? Where's Dub? I don't know. I haven't seen him all morning. Go find Dub. Y'all wasting time. Tell that nigga his ass is mine. Wait a minute. Ain't this your peeps? Yeah, but we fell out when I took this job. I swear to God I ain't bring her here. I promise I ain't know, Caleb. Please. Damn is he? Is he dead? What you mean is he dead? Can't you hear him breathing like a goddamn polar bear? Wake your ass up, Dub. What motherfucker? Well, wake his ass up. No, fuck that. Come down here and get this shit off my grass. Check her car and tie their ass up in the garage. I'm 'bout to torture their ass. Come on. Oh shit, I don't know. But I did find old girl purse and a gun and some sleeping pills. And this. Y'all take y'all bitches home. Take Tiff, too. I need to be alone. Okay, whatever you say, Caleb. I believe in the serpent and the lion. Mystery of mysteries and his name Baphomet. Lookie here. You a bad, bad kid. How long you been planning on rescuing my pretty? You must think you super bad. Coming here and try to run my pad. You sick fuck. She's just a baby. Maybe I am. Thought you might say something more useful, Miss Ma'am. Anyway, I found your gun and the little sleeping pills. Better start explaining before this shit get too fucking real. You scream, I'm gon' have to get mean. Caleb. Let Ny'Kia go. She's just a kid. Just a kid? You should see some of the things this ass done did. You won't get away with this shit. They're gonna be looking for me. My ex-husband, the ex-cop. You should be scared. Wait what rhymes with scared? Shut up. You gon' die if you don't tell me why you came to my crib and drugged my guy. He was only supposed to be collateral damage, but he did buy me a breakfast sandwich, you sick fuck. It's gon' be so nice having your head on my alter as a sacrifice. Bam, baby. You got busted in your head. Shit. What's going on? Bam, baby. You busted in your head. You lucky it wasn't me 'cause I would've filled your head with lead, you sick fuck. What the hell is going on? He tried to kill us. Gotta hurry. Come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on. Nobody's home, but they'll be back to finish the job. Where is everyone? Come on, baby, wake up. We gotta go, we gotta go. Oh shit, come on. Please, please, so we can get outta here. Cal, come on bestie. Come on, come on. We gotta go, come on. Cal. Cal, wake up. Cal, please. Come on, come on. Cal, wake up. Shit. Wake up. We gotta get outta here. I need some keys. Where's the keys? Check my pocket. Your pocket. Shit. Come on. Ny'Kia, come on. Come on, come on, Cal. Please bestie, wake up. I just have to get this off my chest before I get home. It was crazy. Tabby was getting tired of not being able to call her mom and Uncle Gerald and decided that she was leaving. We planned on going together, but I was in the room with Caleb when she tried sneaking out. They found her trying to climb the back gate and Caleb shot her in the back right as she climbed to the top. Tabby was still alive, but they dragged her in the garage and I never saw her again. She was my best friend. Before we met yesterday, Miss Ebony, Caleb beat me up and threatened to kill me if I didn't keep quiet. So I got drunk to deal with it. I couldn't call nobody because he took my phone, but I got lucky today and broke into the locked drawer next to his bed while he was gone. You were the first person I called because I knew you would come and get me. I don't know why. I just did. Why didn't you call the police? I know this sounds crazy, but I didn't want Caleb to get mad at me and I was scared that he would kill me before they got a chance to get to the house. Well, you don't have to worry about that anymore. We're all going home now. Deontae, what are you doing in my house? No. No. Deontae. What are you doing in my house? Scream all you want. Ah. Your neighbors are not even home. We're gonna be gone by five. You get me? It's pretty good. You got good taste. Tell me why you've been ignoring me. It wasn't intentional. I've just been busy with work. Yeah? That's what they all say. Too busy to call. Too busy to text. Look what you made me do. You're gonna have to take care of it now. Why don't I put on some new music, huh? Get off of me. Get off. Get off of me. Why, Deontae? Why? Ebby? You home? You say something and I will slit your fucking throat and cut out your tongue. Stupid, stupid. You sick motherfucker. Wait, no. It's a little late to be shy now. I'm not shy, Mark. I just. I never seen you like this before. Well I never seen you like that. Damn Ebony, what happened to your neck? That piece of shit do that? No. Somebody else did. I have no idea what you doing in that job. It's gotta be some pretty damn exciting stuff. I'm just glad you make it home every night. Shit. You and me both. Say. Wanna have a drink? I'll drink yours if you don't. I'm gonna have to say yes. A real strong one I might add. After the day that I had, I need it. Okay. Let's go. This is really good. It's strong. Yeah, like me. Yeah, like you. You should have been knowing that, but nah, you think a man like me can't handle the sexual shenanigans that you're used to. Sexual shenanigans? Really? Really. That's probably why you like them boys so young. Well, you know what I always say. You're old enough to vote. Then you're old enough to stroke. Wait. Come on, girl. You ain't the only pimp on the block. That's my line, girl. Mark, you know why I prefer younger men? Because they're easy to manipulate? No, 'cause they make me feel young. Ebony. Age is just a number. It only matters if you make it matter. If you feel old, that's on you. But girl, you look damn good for your age. Be proud. Nah, I look damn good for your age. But Mark, so do you. I mean, you're so strong and I gotta admit, kind of turned me on watching you, tiger. Girl, you better watch yourself. To new beginnings. New beginnings. I'll drink to that. Just tell me, Ebony. Is that that boy's car whose ass I just kicked? Nope. Hello? Ebony, I don't know what the hell you been doing the last few days, but today is the deadline on that Lewis case. Where are you on that? Mike. It's fucking 6:47 in the morning. You better be dead or dying but still- - Yeah, well early bird gets the worms. Speaking of worms, Mike. You're a real piece of shit. You know that? Tell me something I don't know. You sound like my ex-wife. God. Fuck her. I closed that case day before yesterday. I didn't see anything wrong, other than some poor old man who's doing the best he can how he can. He's actually disabled and needs his claim to go through. And that's what I did. Listen. I'm the boss, not you. And if you don't find him guilty of something today, I'm gonna have my cousin do your job for half of what I pay you. I need that extra two grand bonus in my account by five o'clock today or I'm gonna can your ass. I'll tell you what. I quit, asshole. I will be my own damn boss. And don't ever call me again. I'll have my new man come and kick your pasty, fat ass. Got it? Okay, Miss Ebony Hustle. So I'm your new man now, huh? I just said that so he can leave me alone. I was about to say, I ain't young enough. Nope, but you still a man. All day, every day. But I got to get to work. Well, thanks for everything. Have a good day at work. You too. I mean, good luck finding another job. But still, have a good day. Ebony Howard? Yes. You too. Hello. Hello? Is this Miss Ebony? Yes, it is. Who am I speaking with? Oh, I'm Maggie Mathews. I got your number from Glenda Shaw, but I've been hearing about you and how you took down that evil rapper's whole organization by yourself. Well, not really, but thank you. How can I help you? I need your help finding my son. Well ma'am, I'm not the police. I don't want no police. I want action and results. That's why I called you. Especially after you helped little Ny'Kia. Can I think about this and call you back at this number? Sure, honey. I can pay for your expenses up to $10,000 if that helps you make a decision. I look forward to hearing from you soon. You have a good day, Miss Maggie. Miss Ebony, there are no words to express the heartfelt joy and love that I honestly have for you. And I'm so grateful for your assistance with bringing Ny'Kia back home where she belongs. I hope you don't mind that I've branded you my personal hero and I've been telling any and everyone about your big heart and fearlessness. Ny'Kia is totally enamored with you and tells everybody that you're her big sister. And although we just found out, she plans on naming my first grandbaby after you and Tabby. Tabitha Ebony Shaw. Once she arrives in May. I hope you don't mind. I took up a little donation in the neighborhood to pay for your services and toss in a little extra just because. Please stay safe and come visit us soon. Maybe we'll meet again when Felicia tosses somebody else through the door. We truly do love and miss you. Best wishes. Glenda and Ny'Kia Shaw. Oh, hey. Evening to you. Hey. Yeah, I'm good. How 'bout you, Mr. Mark? Oh, you know me. Another day, another dollar. Make you wanna scream and holler. Oh, no. Not you, too. What do you mean? You sound like Caleb Truth's ass. Girl, please. Don't compare me to that chump. I can't stand his ass. Ah, finally somebody that hates his ass just as much as I do. Want a nightcap? Or are you too busy with your boy toys? Nah, I could really use a nightcap. All right. I'll see in a minute. All right, Mr. Mark. All right. Hey, Ebony. Girl, you riding clean. When you get that? Felicia and Jorge? What y'all doing? We're about to get ready to go to breakfast. You wanna come? Yeah, I'm trying to convince her to be my new girl. Y'all together? The world ain't ready. Uh uh. Well, they better get ready, right mami? Right, papi. Well, y'all have fun. I'm on my way to see Cal. Oh, how is she? You know, I heard she got into a fight last night with some of Caleb Truth's posse. Something like that. Well, we can come and visit her after we go get something to eat. I don't know, babe. I might still be eating later on. Girl. He is a mess. What am I gonna do with him, sis? I can't. Lord Jesus, help us all. Bye, y'all. They are so, oh my god. Jorge, get ready. What's good, Eb? Hey. You okay? How you doing? Yeah. You all right? Yeah, I'm much better. Especially after my little stay. Let me tell you. There ain't nothing like being taking care of by a fine sister. Are you serious? Let me show you though real quick. Look. You know what? Oh, so that's your new boo? Girl, look, you a mess. I can't with you. I cannot with you. Speaking of boo things. Guess who I saw on my way over here? Girl, who? Guess who a couple? Who? My girl Felicia and Jorge. Nah, I'm serious. You lie. I'm serious. They a couple. I don't know about that. I mean, shit. You know what though? What? I guess anything's better than the Black Ron's ass. For real. For real. Girl, crazy ass Deontae. Who, cougar cub? Yes. What about his ass? Girl, he broke into my house. What? Yes. Mark beat his ass. He saved my life. Beat his ass. You okay? I mean, yeah. Yeah, you know me. I'm always good. But. But what? I mean. Oh shit. What? About time you done came to your senses. I always liked Mark for you. No, no. He saved my life. He looked damn good doing it. Mm. I bet. For real though. I'm sorry about what I said at the art gallery. Here you go with that mushy shit. Who cares about that shit right now? The important thing is we still girls, right? Yeah. Good. You saved my life, Eb. So I owe you mines and more. You don't owe me nothing, Cal, but I do owe you a sincere apology. I'm sorry what I brought to you. Let's look at it this way. None of that shit would have went down, I wouldn't have been able to meet my little boo thing right here. You know what? I can't with you. You a mess. You know that, right? Well, well, well. If it isn't Thelma and Louise. What's up, Wayne? But we still alive though. I mean by the looks of it barely. Wayne, do not start. I haven't had my coffee yet. Girl, I never know when to start with you ever. But. You seen the news? What? Oh, boy. Check it out. What? Wait what? Mm hm. Oh. Yeah, Ebony. I have no idea how you manage to leave all your personal belongings behind and still not get more involved than you already are. My purse. My key. My phone. Damn, it's all at the house. No, it's not. I took care of that for you. Eb, you a hero girl. You saved that girl's life. That's all anybody's been talking about. What? Yeah. Shit. Shit, Eb. You famous. Hey, I just need you to come down to the station and sign for your stuff. I had your car towed to my cousin Manny's yard and you're gon' have to answer some questions to the FBI 'cause they want your side of this story. This crazy story. Crazy story it is. I just feel sorry for Lil Dub though. Who? Nobody. Well, I'm gonna let you guys get back to your little hen party. I got these flowers for you, Cal. Damn. All right, Wayne. Well, thank you for my flowers. Of course. Every girl deserves flowers. You get better, girl. Thank you. You did good, bro. - See you later. - All right, see you. Look at this. Well. Looks like ex-hubby want his old boo thing back. I mean, we did. We decided that we'd be better off just friends. Mark and I did, too. Two of the good ones, huh? Girl, whatever. Hi. Miss Matthews?
