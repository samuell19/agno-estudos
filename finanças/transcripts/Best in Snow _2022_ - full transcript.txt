Welcome, welcome, welcome, everyone. I am the honorary Mayor Frostifer Von Fjord. Our lovely little town of Snowdome has hosted this grand snow carving event since I was a wee little lad. And we welcome everyone who has journeyed near and far to be here for this glorious competition. This year's theme is "Better Together." Meaning, when we work together with love in our hearts and creativity as our goal, we are all better together. Over the next four days leading up to Christmas Eve, each team will create a magnificent sculpture inspired by the magical world of The Walt Disney Company. But it is up to them to decide what they will carve. Ooh! At the end, one team will be declared, "Best in Snow." And now, I'd like to introduce our two esteemed judges, who, between the two of them, have decades of snow carving know-how. Sue McGrew exploded onto the scene as a world-renowned sand sculptor and has won accolades in more than 85 competitions and festivals in over 35 countries. - Wowsies. - Whoo! Andre Rush is a military veteran, inspirational speaker, and has been a White House chef for over four administrations. And through it all, he's kept his love of carving snow alive for almost 20 years. Two of the best here to see you do your best. And teams, you won't be alone. Standing next to your blocks of snow, you see our town's finest carvers. Each team will have two of Snowdome's most talented carvers to help you execute your design and carve your blocks of snow into works of art. Plus, you'll have a wealth of tools to help you carve, chisel, and create your sculptures. So, what are we waiting for? Head on over to your blocks. It's time to find out who is Best in Snow. Hey, guys. So, we're your carvers. We're gonna help you guide whatever your idea's gonna be... - Right. - And help you get to that point. - What kind of background do you have? - Well, we're all glass artists. - Wow. Amazing. - So exciting to have - an all-female team. - Yeah! Hi guys, my name is Que. I am your fearless leader. This is my big, handsome, strong husband... - Yeah. And... - Emmanuel. I am Emmanuel, like she said. And this is my gorgeous wife, Que. They okay. I'm Charm... the good luck charm of this crew, - and this is my man, my boo, Ron. - Hello. Whoo! All right. Hey, guys. My name's Danny. I'm the team captain. I brought some of my best friends. We're all competitive sculptors in different mediums. We're some of the best there is, but we've never dealt with snow. I'm Edward, the team captain. And this is my team. We're a bunch of pumpkin carvers. - Wow, no way! That's awesome! - Yep. Yeah. That's gonna be really handy in applying that to this. - Absolutely. - I hope so. - Yeah, right? - Have you guys messed around with any other mediums like, maybe, snow for example? - I carve my way into my car sometimes. - Oh, yeah. I'm Dave. This my daughter, Reaghan. - And I'm Brandon. This is my mom, Lisette. - It's good to meet you. - Yes, good to meet you too. - Great. Excited. All right, so we've got a ten-by-ten foot block of snow to work with, and the whole world of the Walt Disney Company to choose from. - What are we thinking? - I think we should pick a movie that means something to us. Something from the heart. That's what we should really decide to do. What about Coco? Oh... Yeah, that's a great movie. That is an awesome movie. - And it's all about families. - Yes, it is. - Yes. - It's all about family. - Right? - I cried through the whole thing. That hits home right there. - I come from Mexico and... - Wow. Perfect. I know all the tradition about the... that movie. It's amazing. This is what a winning team looks like. - What I'm talkin' about. Right here. - For sure. - Let's cut it. - Yeah. - Let's do it. Do it. - Let's open this package. - Yeah! - Yeah! Who's ready to cut this ribbon? Yes! Look out! Nice. Judge Andre, Judge Sue, it's an honor to have you two experts with us. Now, tell me, what do you think are going to be the biggest challenges for our teams? Well, first of all, look how big those blocks of snow are. They're massive. Twenty tons. I know, that's a ten-by-ten-by-ten block of compacted snow. - Forty moose. - Oh, my God, or three elephants. - Or six baby elephants? - Aw. How do you plan on choosing our champions? There are three things we're looking for. Teamwork, craftsmanship, and the wow factor. - They've got their work cut out for them. - Mm-hmm. - Literally. - Yep. Take that all the way - to the side... - All right. The plan is basically mark up this cube. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - So, that we can translate your... - Okay. - Picture your, you know, the... - I'm excited about that part. - Your idea to this. - Right. - Yes. I mean, I don't know how this is gonna turn into that but... Uh-huh. That's what Paul and I are here for. - That's the thing, we got this. - Trust us. I'm looking at this like, what, who, when, where, why, how we gonna do this? We have four days. - Whoo! - Four days to turn a block of snow into some beautiful creation. I'm working in this grid. So, we can follow these lines. It's very easy for somebody who is not a sculptor to follow these lines when you are working. All right, guys, so the first thing about removing some of this big snow is gonna be making some markings. You have to work with the numbers in Spanish. There you go! Reaghan's gonna come out... ...talking Spanish by the end of this. Lisette and Brandon are friends of ours. As a group, we started with Reaghan and Brandon being in the high school marching band. As parents, we got involved when they were looking for help with sets, designs, and that's where I met Lisette and we just hit it off. - Let's bring it in. Let's bring it in. - Let's go. Let's go. Let's bring it in. One, two, three. Having your daughter by your side is not something that can happen every single day. ¡Ándale! Whoo! As a parent, life really doesn't get any better than this moment right now. Yes! Whoever's gonna cut from this side, we're gonna cut that all the way off from that side to that side and just let it drop. So, we're ready to go. The first thing that we're gonna do is we're gonna mark up the block - on where we're gonna do those first cuts. - Okay. All right? We're gonna expand this block up, so that it gives more "wow factor." So, we're goin' even bigger than what it is. - We're going outside... - Big. - The block. It's gonna be a little... - Perfect! Bit more complicated but I think we can handle that complication. We are a team of competitive carvers. I have a background in ice and wood and pumpkin carving. Liza, she's a fantastic carver and Bob is a wonderful wood carver. I think as great artists, we're constantly pushing ourselves. It doesn't matter what field we were in. It doesn't matter if we were going out there carving rock, carving whatever. We're gonna make it happen. The Disney film we are using is The Muppet Christmas Carol. We've got Statler and Waldorf who play Marley and Marley. We have the penguins. We have Rizzo and Gonzo. It's gonna be cool. - We're not messing around here. No way. - No. No, no. Let's move a lot today. - We're now snow carvers. - Yeah! Put that on a resume. How do we do this? All right. Um, come up to the... to... Yeah. - Great. - For real. - He's a beast. - He is. - What am I holding? What is a cable saw? - Those are the handles for this cable saw. We're gonna stretch this cable saw across from this side to that side and then we're gonna do this sawing motion. - Whoa! Whoa! - Yeah. Boom! - It's done! - Boom! Yeah! We did it. We did it! They're cut... What are they doing? They're cutting already? We're making lines. Let's... let's go. - Okay, we gotta get going. - All right. All right. We gotta go a little faster. Let's go. When that thing broke loose, I saw the fear in everybody's eyes. - Okay? I saw the fear. - Did you? Becky, you're gonna pull Sarah off the ground. Yeah. - Heave! - Ho! - Heave! - Ho! Yes! Yeah! - Dudes. - Yes! Yeah! Yeah! - One, two, three. All right. - One, two, three. It's very intimidating looking around at these professionals. They're working as they've done this before. They're using long saws to cut massive blocks of snow off. They're cutting, they're slicing, they're making their design. We're going up top and we are digging down one shovel at a time. Our sculpture is based on the movie Coco. It's gonna be a huge stage. Miguel is gonna be front and center on the stage playing his guitar. And his family's gonna be around him enjoying the moment. But to fit all of our ideas, we are gonna require all four sides. So, we can't cut off anything. So, it's very intimidating for us. Everyone else is starting to take shape. Ours is just a big square still. I know it's gonna be a lot of work. But I'm the young one. And I'm all, you know, muscles. So, I just decided to do it because I didn't want them to hurt their backs. Thanks, babe. That was great. So, just do a little "V" cut, okay? So, it's like that. A little "V" cut. So, like that, and like that. - All right. - This is a finer grit. This is gonna make it like a smoother... a smoother surface than this one will. This is a... a gouge chisel. It's got a little bit of a curve, so it'll make kind of a curved cut. Anybody worked with anything like this before? Paul, Paul, Paul, Paul. That I know. I know what that is. - What's this? - I use that to clean out my deep freezer. Oh, my goodness. Me and this handsome, handsome guy right here have been married for almost 17 years. - I was a traveling basketball player... - Mm. And she was at one of the games. Any other time, I'm too fabulous. I am not finna come and approach you. But he was cute. And short. So, that was kinda different. Baby, it's okay. You're tall. You're six feet. Don't look at me. Me and my husband have been married for 15 years. We have three beautiful children. What made us decide to do this competition... - Set! Go! - We like to compete together. And it's a new experience, snow carving. But we gonna reel it in, put it together, - and we gonna win this together. - Right. We are from a hot, hot, hot, place. I do not like the cold. I do not. I don't even like to walk in the grocery aisle by the cold section. - I don't like the cold. - It bad. I don't like the cold. But I like to win. - Hello. Hello. - It's the mayor. - Hey, hey, hey! - It's the mayor! Okay, greetings. Greetings. I love that enthusiasm. You wanna know something crazy? I'm actually allergic to snow. - What? - Me too. Really? I... I... I drink a bottle of antihistamine every morning. But... but more importantly, what is your team's name? - Hakuna Matata. - Oh! It's wonderful. - And... and what are you gonna carve? - We are carving Lion King. We are gonna have the Serengeti spread out like 20 feet wide. We're gonna have trees and grass. Timon and Pumba. And the feature of our sculpture is Simba and Nala. Behind Simba and Nala, we will have the spirit of Mufasa in a cloud. How exciting! I won't tell a soul, but I love it. I love The Lion King so much that my password for everything is "Mufasa." - He's the greatest. - I... I... I... I probably - shouldn't have shared that, huh? - Yeah. Probably. Yeah. - Yeah, uh... - Okay. Uh... - uh, I'll leave you to it! - Awesome. Good carving to all. - Bye, Mayor. - Take care. - Hakuna Matata. - Bye, Mayor. - Bye, Mayor - Bye, Mayor - Bye, bye, bye, Mayor, bye... - Go, go, go, Mayor, go, go... You guys, work harder, faster. Let's go. - She's like on the floor. - Margaret! You're literally doing a job laying down. Get up! We are all glass artists. When people see us working for the first time, they very frequently say, "This is so much like a dance." I think that speaks to the bond we have together. Look at that. That's a trick. Looking good, ladies. Sarah, that's amazing. I do consider glass artists to be the rockstars of the glass community. And we know how to party. On my birthday, we had pickles and cake. So, yeah, we... we party. Moana has a strong female lead and had all the things that we wanted all together. Our design focuses mainly on two main characters. Moana and Te Fiti. We really wanted to focus in on the emotion of that moment in the movie. That head touch and explosion of emotion. So, we're hoping to do that part to perfection and really wow the judges that way. - Yeah, girls. - Yeah, we totally have it. Nice job, ladies. - Yeah, rotate up. There you go. - Okay. - Okay, slide back toward me. - Yep. I'm pulling. I'm pulling. Yeah. - Oh, God. - I think... - Yeah. - I got frostbite on my pinky toe. This is hard work. - One, two, three. - One, two, three. - Push. - Push. Push. Push, push, push, push... Push it. Yes! - Yas, queen! Yas, queen! - Yas, queen! We all met at a jack-o'-lantern exhibition, where I am the studio manager and these are my three top artists. - Oh, my God! - Wow! It's me. Last year, we carved over 624 intricate jack-o'-lanterns. Absolute chaos. Absolute chaos. - Absolutely crazy. - It was crazy. We sort of found in each other a little bit of ourselves. Like Guardians of the Galaxy. Just like this team of weirdos and we're gonna save the galaxy. And we're gonna make a really bomb ass snow sculpture and we're gonna beat everybody else. Thereby saving the galaxy. - Thereby... - Thereby saving... Save... Thereby saving Snowdome. Yeah. Hello. - Hello! Hey! - Hi! - How was your journey here? - Delightful. - Magical. - Oh, I love to hear that. Now, have you figured out what you're carving yet? - We have. - Yes. Yeah. Oh! Please tell me. You're gonna tell anybody else? Of course not, it'll be our little secret. - Thank you. Thank... - Okay. We're gonna have Rocket from Guardians of the Galaxy. You know that one? I've watched Guardians of the Galaxy so many times. Volume One and Two. He's gonna be down on one knee and then we're gonna have little Baby Groot... Just like that. Perfect! - Oh, that looks great. - Yeah. Just... Just like that. How exciting! - Absolutely. - I love that Rocket and Groot. - I love that all he says is, "I'm Groot." - Absolutely. - I'm Groot. - Uh-huh. - I'm Groot. - No! I was so inspired after seeing the movie, I spent a week only saying, "I am Mayor Frostifer Von Fjord." And nothing else. How did that work? It got in the way of a lot of city business. Anywho! - Yeah! - Good carving to all! Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Whoa! I see feet. - What is happening over there? - I know, right? Did you fall in through the hole? Yeah. It was awesome. - This is like a pizza oven. - I know. - Looks just like a pizza oven to me. - I'm hungry now. I know, right? I think it's time for dinner. You know, everyone got so much done today. Kinda need to catch up now, a little bit. But I don't know, we behind or not? The green team. They look good. I don't know what they doing. They might be behind. The blue team, they got... They... They behind, too. They behind, too. Hey, are we talking, or are we working over there, huh? I think if you guys talked a little less, you'd be a little further along. What? What'd you say... Bring it on! Bring it on, man! No more light Now, it's night You are done with day one Muscles sore from carving snow Pace yourselves, there's three days to go Sleep and eat healthy food Sleep and eat healthy food Like broccoli - All right, that's it. - All right, Coco's. - Day one. That's a wrap. - All right. Follow me. - This way. - Come on, guys. Good job, team. High fives. - Oh. - That's just really cool. - High frostbites. - Bye, y'all! - Hey! - Buenos noches. - Good job, team. - Yeah. - Beautiful song. - It was good. I am confident that we're gonna win this competition because we're all - really talented artists. - Yeah. - We are the team to beat. - We are the team to beat. - Yeah. - Good luck. - Good night. Bye. - Good night. - Don't forget to eat your broccoli. - Bye. All these other teams need to know that we don't like to lose. On the day of judgment... - Mm. - We will walk out as winners. Oh, drop the mic. Oh, my God, baby. I'm gonna need a back massage. - You promise? - I promise. Let's go, Sunny. We got what we needed. Now, we just gotta find our way home. It's hard to tell with all this fresh snow. Just gotta pick one of these two paths. Uh, that way feels right, but... I'm thinking, this darker scarier path. Good morning to all you teams We hope you are having fun Before we begin day two Let us look back on day one You are welcome to our town Mayor said hello Then you'll have to make a choice Of what you're going to carve Then one chose the Lion King Moana and Te Fiti Coco and the Muppets Guardians of the Galaxy Then you began to carve Make initial cuts Doesn't really look like much So, you need to keep carving Yeah! Yes! Welcome to day two of the competition. Snow Voyagers, Coco's Carvers, Hakuna Matata, Bah Humbugs... and Rocket Queens. You've all chosen your names, I see. And the battle to become the Best in Snow has commenced. I'm excited to see how your snow sculptures are progressing. Good carving to all! - Yeah! - Yeah! What are some of the tasks that we can get on today? Uh, Danny, we're gonna get you on this penguin here. - I brought the saw for it. - Perfect. William, we got you on one of those blocks. And then Bob, Liza, and Heather, you guys will start going up top, and really nailing down the Marleys on the sled. We've got our sled design coming here with an angle coming back up. It's a steep angle. It's gonna look really cool. - Gonna look awesome. - We are way out and beyond - whatever anybody else is doing. - It's good. I'm gonna wow everybody. I hope your muscles are all in great shape... this morning because we've got a lot more hollowing out to do. As we're looking around at all the other carvings, you start to see everyone's designs coming together. And you can't help but notice the Bah Humbugs. And you turn around and look at us, and we still got our pizza oven. So, we've got a lot of important work for you today. Lisette, we need you to start finding our buildings - on this left side. - Nice. I think we have you and Brandon on the inside of the block. And we get to start with some smaller tools. We get to get into the details. This is super great tool to sharpen and to make the walls very straight. It seems like we might be working at a slower pace than the other teams, but I know that today we're focusing on details, and we're gonna just power through it. We can really get those details in there on the face, on the flowers, so we can just rock it out the rest of the competition. And then win. By the end of the day, the goal is, when you look at this, you should be able to see where the two lions are... and you'll see where Rafiki's gonna be. Looking at the other sculptures... - Seriously. - It seems like we're a little behind. - We don't know what they're making. - Well, I know the purple team is making a mess. I know that. So, what do you think we're at compared to the other teams today? We're definitely up way far ahead than that red team. If we could've everything roughed out by the end of the day, and, uh, Groot's gonna be standing on these presents here. So, we gotta draw these presents in here and get them carved in as well. And getting this exciting hollowed out part. With his arm extended, - that's the dangerous part... - Yeah, yeah. - ...of the sculpture. - What makes it a danger point? Snow doesn't like that 90-degree angle. So, what is that? Probably a... a 110? More like... - What is math? - What is math? - I'm here because I make pretty things. - Right. - Math... - We're artists, not mathematicians. Don't ask me to do math. You take that up to the top, and push it all the way back. - Straight away. - Get... get rid of everything. We are still looking at this block of ice, like, "Oh, my gosh." We have a lot to get done. And looking around at everyone else's sculpture, and it's coming to life. And we still have a block of snow. What I could use your help in right now, is just... letting me know as I'm drawing. Since, I'm up so close, it's a little harder for me to see. - Yeah. - Like, how long should the neck be? Like, does it need to... 'Cause we're coming all the way down to the ground here. Does the shoulder start up here... or more like down here? - I'm thinking down there. - I think so, too. Listen, we have no experience in snow carving at all. Watching the carvers sketch the lions? - I mean, it was entertaining... - Yeah. But it's like how are we... gonna put that in that and bring it out. Look, it's intimidating. Yeah. Oh. Wow! Hey, guys. - Come on down. - Hey, judges. - Hey. Hey. - How's it going? - That's good. It's so tall. - Good. That's the top of one of the Marleys' heads. So, you actually added on top of your actual sculpture. - Absolutely. - So, you made it higher? Yes, sir. We came here to go big. We didn't travel as far as we did to be mediocre. We're here to win. Sometimes, the best piece involves risks. We're also adding an element of ice in a couple of different areas. So, we're adding ice for the chains on Marley and Marley, and then we have an ice lake that we're gonna make. It sounds like a really ambitious design. You may be trying to do too much. That might be your downfall. Okay. One, two, three. - I feel like we're a little behind. - I do, too. What are we gonna do? - Did you see the other teams? - I don't know. Like, the Bah Humbugs... - have that huge, like thing. - I saw. - And then they already have their sleigh? - I know. But then when I see the flowers, - I know it will come together. - I know, the flowers do look beautiful. - Hey! - Snow Voyagers. - Snow Voyagers. - Come on around. Wow. Tell us a little bit about your design. So, we've decided to do the details that we know will make people say, "Wow." And that is the flowers, the vines, and Moana's face. We're really focusing on that moment, and we're worried that if we have too much detail around that, you're gonna miss the impact of that moment. Simplicity is not easy. Everybody's trying to go big and bad. You guys are keeping it simple. So, make sure you hit it on the mark. So, guys, what are your concerns about the snow sculpture? So, with Rocket, we have him kneeling on one knee and sort of reaching ahead. And the raccoons have really small arms and legs, really fine. And so, it's gonna be a lot of weight from this head and this torso on these small, - sort of, like, supports. - So, what do you have at the bottom? You've said the top, the Rocket. We love Groot. I love Groot. So... what is it at the bottom of your sculpture? So, on the left side over here, this... this column right here is pretty much gonna be Groot and the flowerpot. Right where our steps start is gonna be like a stack of presents with bows and ribbons and like, wrapping paper. Okay. You... you caught my attention. I know personally, bows are hard. How are you gonna keep them from snapping off? - Yes. - What's your plan? Trial and error. Yeah. Yeah, we're also a bit curious... - about that, honestly. - Yeah. You have to nail it. So, we are recreating what, Paul? - The Serengeti. - The Serengeti. Over here, what does it look like right now? A block of ice. It's not. - It's not. - This is a tree. Come on, imagination. It's a tree, okay? Now, look over here. - Where's the other one? Over here? - Over there. - What's that? What does it look like? - Stand over there. - Uh, a block of ice. - Wrong! Wrong again. - It's a tree. Okay? - It's a tree. This is ambitious. How... how big is it? We're gonna double the size of the original block. So, that is double-sided. You have to do a three-sixty. So, you give your audience the go all the way around it. You have to do it right. - Hey! Coco's Carvers! - Coco's Carvers! - Hey! - Hey! Come on around. Tell us a little bit about your sculpture. We chose Coco because we have a huge connection to it. Her mom's on the other side, my father's on the other side. You know, obviously, Reaghan's grandfather and Brandon's grandmother. Día de los Muertos is the one night of the year our ancestors can come visit us. We put their photos on the ofrenda, so their spirits can cross over. The connection I have with Coco, the movie, that it was so heartfelt for me... When it first started playing, I was like, "Oh, this is adorable. You know, what a cute little boy." And then as the movie progressed, um, I connected with the grandmother. Um, because... um, you know, my mother had Alzheimer's. It boggles my mind how... how perfectly it fit with me was... Coco, she would come back every time Miguel would sing a song that her father used to sing with her. - Know that I'm with you the only way... - Know that I'm with you the only way... And my mother always used to sing a song with her father when she was a little girl. And every time I would try to connect with her, I would play that song and she would come back. Every chisel that I'm gonna put in that big block is gonna be for her and her memories, you know? So, what the movie was about, right? I know that this is the last thing I could do for my mom. 'Cause this is for my mom. I feel that... What they call in Spanish, La Día de los Muertos, is every day. You remember them every day. Come on, you guys. - Make room for us. - Get in here, Andre. Oh, yes. This is what it's all about, right? Yes. Go! - Go! - All right. - Uh, excuse me. - Uh. It sure is cold, huh? It's not that easy turning blue. - Hey, Kermit's here, guys. Kermit's here. - What? - Uh, hey, gang. - Yes! - Kermit the Frog is here. - What are you doing here? Oh, well, you know, I heard you were making a snow sculpture of Muppets, so I… I thought I'd drop by. - Fantastic. - Yeah. You know, after two flights, trudging 17 miles through a blizzard, and swimming upstream with a family of vacationing penguins, here I am. And there they go. Great meeting you Peggy and Po! - Penguins. - Well, we sure are glad you're here. - Yeah. - Well, you know, I thought that maybe I can help with the carving, huh? - Yeah. - That'd be awesome. - You can jump up there. - What do you do, or... - Wh... what? Okay. What? Oh. What? - Whoa! Whoa, not so fast. Not so fast. According to the scroll... - Yeah, you got a scroll there. - It's clearly stated - that once the competition has begun... - Uh-huh. - No team may add another person. - What about frogs? - Uh, let's see here. Um... - Excuse me. - Sub-section four B. No. No frogs. - Oh, that's too bad. Well... well, I... Sorry, I wish there was some way to help, guys. Oh, don't worry, Kermit. We'll find the right spot. What sounds right to you? Uh, well. Uh. Ooh, ooh, ooh. Maybe I could be the mayor. Taken. - Got it. Um… - FROSTIFER: Oh, oh! How about, um, sharpening, uh… the carving tools... like knives and... and saws. No, thank you. Uh, ever since my high school biology class, I try to avoid sharp objects. Oh, oh, oh, or you could hang the rooftop decorations. Ooh, that's a great idea but not a good fit for me. I mean, I'm barely two feet tall. But hey, thanks for not noticing, by the way. - You're a really nice mayor. - Oh! Wow. And it sounds like you are a good judge of character. Wait a second. Did you say judge? - I certainly did. - Well, that's it. - I can be a judge! - Oh, no! Thanks for the idea, Mayor. I'll go talk to the judges. No. No, no, no, no. Kermit, wait. Okay. - And he's gone. Um... - Well. Carry on. Um, good carving to all! - This is so cool - Kermit! We are working so hard, and it is almost 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Which is really heckin' hot. Oh, the sun is brutal out here. God, the other side is just like, melting away. Hot is not good for the snow, so we're freakin' out just a little bit. So, you think these are gonna hold up? We'll definitely have to move them into shade. - The sun's gonna beat 'em down. - Yeah. I say, sun's gonna keep moving into this area. Yep. Ooh! Oh! I'm so sorry, everyone. I look up, and the left arm of the top Marley is gone. - This is not good. - It's so hot right now. The sun... The snow turned into mashed potatoes, and... So, what's our plan? - A total disaster - It's a total disaster You have really messed up... You were doing great But now you are not You need to fix this Don't worry you still have time What are you going to do now? What are you going to do now... What are we gonna do? What are you going to do now? Fix your mistake That's a shady choir. So, Snowdome is definitely an interesting place. If you mess up, or have a controversy, Carolers will come out and narrate it for you. I don't think it's usable. So, we might have to make a fresh piece here about the same dimension. - Yeah. - And then fuse it back on. I think that's probably our best option. This is a massive setback. I don't know if anyone can understand how big of a setback this can be. Before they sing another song, let's get this thing back on. I feel like some of our biggest competition were the, um, Bah Humbugs. And I feel like the underdog status is no longer ours. Just sayin'. Let's lift it. Make some more sugar snow, and pack it in around. - Okay. - We're gonna pack it - all the way around, okay? - Okay. There you go. Nice. That's perfect. At first, we were a little bit behind. But now, we have vision, we're seeing clear. The competitors are comin' out. We had a lot of complicated elements. We get finished putting the arm up. Things were a little hectic. But when we stepped back from our piece today, I was confident. But I'm never too confident to say that we can't be beat. But we can't be beat. Yeah, I can see it. Hi, Michael. Hear ye! Hear ye! As your mayor, I have a proclamation. I have just received the weather forecast for Christmas Eve. And we are expecting heavy cloud cover, which means our town will be nearly impossible for Santa to see, as he passes over in his sleigh. In order for Santa to deliver presents to the residents of Snowdome, we need to shine as much light up into the night sky as possible. To achieve this feat, we are asking each team to incorporate bright lights into their sculptures. Ooh, I love lights. How does that sound? I love it. But listen up, teams. We will be judging you on how you incorporate the lights into your sculpture. Plus, how exactly they illuminate the snow. When you return to your blocks, you will find a special box of lights to make part of your creation. Thank you, judges. And teams, we're counting on you to make sure Santa finds us. Now... Good carving to all! Look at them go. It's like they're opening presents. Wonderful! What's in the box? - Oh, my gosh. - All right. - Cool! - That is perfect. - Whoa! Look at that. - Whoa! - Ave Maria. - Yeah. Whoa. We have so many options to pick from. - Oh, yeah. So many colors. - I have so many ideas. - Exactly, right? - Yeah. Now, now. Uh… uh, tell me, Judge Sue and Judge Andre. How difficult will it be for the teams to add lights to their sculptures? Well, right now, at this stage of the competition, they are exhausted. They have to think about adding this new detail - and get it all done in time. - Judge Andre? Adding the lights is difficult, but hiding the lights and the wires can be the most challenging part. Oh, wait. Okay. This one's honestly perfect. - It's not green. - But it's not green. - It's like… it's like it was made for her. - Wait, I'm sure it… Oh! - Uh... - Push it again. Stop it! Just stop! We're excited. Being glass artists means that we use light in our work all of the time. So, I was actually super stoked to see the fact that we had lighting to use behind the snow. That's really exciting. - This belongs in a skeleton eye. - Yeah. This is like the best thing that could have happened. Our design was basically made for lights to be added to it. We were gonna draw little string lights anyway, so we could just put real ones. And then we've got this giant skull at the back of the stage we can light up. And literally stage lights, like this is the perfect addition to our sculpture. - Oh. - That's some... Disney magic. - What is this? What's this? - Oh, my God. - Oh, no. You guys. - Yeah, really. No, this is great. - You guys... - No, this is great. - This is gonna be awesome. - Yeah. Feels like we was a little bit behind, so I'm looking like, - "Do we have time to do this?" - Right. Now, I'm a little anxious. 'Cause I don't know what we're gonna do with these lights. Is this a gift or another problem that we gotta incorporate into our design with two hours behind already? We got a lot of work. - Yeah. - We're gonna have to work to get this in. We all love to do lighting in our pieces because it really makes them pop. But the issue is time. We already have 40,000 pounds worth of snow to deal with. Now, we got some lights to deal with as well. Well, my friends, day two ends Don't despair, you're halfway there Working hard and doing your best If you're cranky, it's time to rest Sleep and eat all the food Sleep and eat all the food Like Brussels sprouts End of the day. - Okay. Goodnight. - Goodnight. Bye. We're working next to team Bah Humbug. They're using elements like ice that we didn't even consider, - which is really cool. - So cool. Yeah. It's amazing. - It looks really good. - Competition's pretty fierce out there. Yeah, it is. - Eat your Brussels sprouts. - Eat your Brussels sprouts. Looking around at the other teams, you can start to see their characters and shapes coming to life, especially the Bah Humbugs! You could start to tell who the characters are, and all the detail work and everything, and ours is still shaped like a cube. They seem to be the team to beat. We are in a very competitive environment right here. The fire that these people bring to this competition, I couldn't be more confident with the people I'm sitting next to. Yep. And just like the snow sculpting teams from the story, we need the right materials. Let's blend the frosting. A... any luck, buddy? Sunny, you did it! Attaboy! Wait. Mom! I need to vacuum where you're standing. Guys, stop. You're being too loud. I can't hear myself play the bongos They must be really busy. Well, at least the flashlight still works. N... n... n... nice, wolfie. - And we're out of batteries. - Run, Sunny! Good morning, teams Good morning, teams It's so lovely to see you Before you set out on day three Let's look back on your day two The judges came, Andre and Sue And told you what you need to do You carve with care in cold, cold air And now we see snow faces You worked all day and into night From morning until sundown Then you were asked to add some lights So, Santa could find our town Some teams are far, some are behind You can catch up, there is still time So, who will be the Best in Snow It's still too early to know Yes! Welcome to day three of the Best in Snow competition. Yeah, yeah. I trust you've all begun adding lights to your sculptures? Yeah? - Oh! Good, good, good! That mean, it's... - Yes. It's really important that Santa finds our little town, as I... I have been a very, very good boy this year, and I've asked Santa for a new pair of noise cancelling headphones. Y... y... you see, my neighbor has a little dog, and he's quite a yippy one. Ah! And I've been losing lots and lots of sleep. So, please, uh, get those lights ready, yeah? And remember, teams, since our competition comes to a close tomorrow, this is your last night of carving. All right? You can work as long as you want. So, pace yourselves. This could be a very late night. - And remember what I always say... - good carving to all. Yeah! We're doing this. All right, guys, this is day three. Time is drawing nigh. We have to work hard. We have to get all the characters mapped out, carve the detail. We just got to get in there and move. - We're recreating the Serengeti, right? - Uh-huh. We're gonna make a whole forest. Which means we need to make a lot of leaves. I made a little sample one here to show you guys. - Wow. - This is what we're gonna be making. Now, we need to make about a hundred of these. - Whoo! - We're making those? - Yeah, you're gonna be making... - My stomach hurts. Oh, my God. - How many of the these? - How many? Don't worry. One hundred. One-zero-zero. Now, don't worry about it. We're gonna set up an assembly line. Each one of you is gonna have a very specific job. We'll be able to bust these out in no time. It seems we've saved the details for last like, uh, Moana's face. We've gotta bring it all home. We've gotta get Te Fiti, we've got to get Moana. We've gotta get the waves. We have a lot of things to do, but I have no doubt - we're gonna be able to get it done. - No big deal. We got this. Snow big deal. Snow big deal. You know, Rocket's legs are still buried - in this block of snow. - Sure are. His arm's on his knee, - so once we find his arm... - Right. - ...that will dictate where his knees is. - Awesome. We have a still a bit of de-bulking to do, - but then we'll start shaping it out. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Let's make it happen. - All right. Let's do this. - All right. As you can see, we have to do a lot of the architectural features on the three sides, and the back, and both sides. We need to make windows, doors, lots of stairs, and steps. So, we need to work very hard today. The pressure's on now. It has to be tight. What's the plan? - We'll get Gonzo in. - Right. - We'll get Rizzo in on the seat. - Yes. - And the chains. Let's not forget. - The chains? - I know. - You're gonna be working on that today. Have to get busy, we've got a lot of chains to do. - That's right, we got a lot of chains. - Yeah. It's got to be over and above for those other four teams. And now it's up to us to deliver. - Hands in. Let's go. - Come on! Come on! - One, two, three. - One, two, three. Bah Humbugs! - Let's go - WILLIAM: Get to work. I have the most important part of this mission, getting us to the end. I'm the leaves for the tree. So, it's day three. Uh, my mission today is to, um, keep digging. Yes, dig it. Where we're from, snow shoveling is very common. My parents make me, uh, shovel the driveway all the time. I think I got this. - What you working on over here? - Rocket's little old leg. Don't you think it's kinda funny that Rocket's leg is like, the same size as mine? - What? - We got a little chicken bone situation. - No! - Oh, no! Rocket has a chicken leg. His knee is kinda bends out like that. So, what we can do is chop that off. - We gotta, like, push it in. - To push it in. I moonlight as a surgeon. And I'm now in charge of amputating Rocket's leg. So, you think, it should be like, in here? It needs to be underneath his hand. So, it actually needs to be here. So, what we should probably do - is find his present first. - Okay. There is a lot riding on the leg because his body is so big and his legs are pretty small compared to his body. And if they're not big enough or in the right spot, the entire thing could come crashing down. Good luck, bud. Thanks, girl! Chop that chicken leg off. We gotta get to those eyelashes I think, but we can't really do that until the nighttime. We gotta wait until it freezes up. Oh, look at that. I can really see that you're tunneling in there. - Nice. - That's beautiful. We're really excited about this design because we love to see women representing for other young girls out there. And I know Disney does an amazing job of that, putting that on the screen. We are strong, independent women that are going to come together to win this competition, and hopefully nobody underestimates us. All right. Oh, wow. Let's see how the teams are doing. - It's been three days already. - Mm-hmm. You know, and this is the last push through. So, I'm wondering how that's gonna play out. These guys are exhausted. The Snow Voyagers. They're the ones that went simple. We talked about simplicity. Simplicity can be your greatest friend, or your toughest critic. Wow. The Rocket Queens, they've really moved a lot of snow. The only concern I have is, it's massive. They've already made his bust so big. How are they gonna fit his legs and his tail into the composition? They still have a lot to go. Hakuna Matata. One of my favorites... - Yeah. - Just because their energy is so huge. Also, their sculpture. I'm looking at the cloud with Mufasa in the background. - Yeah. - I don't see any of that puffiness - that makes it look like a cloud. - Hopefully, they can get it done. Coco's Carvers. I mean, they had such a strong start, but looking at this now, it's not just four sides. They're carving, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. There are seven sides they're working on now that they've carved into that sculpture. Hopefully it's okay. Hopefully they have their time management sort of under control. - Well, we'll see. - Yeah. The Bah Humbugs, they're the team to beat. I mean, all that height is impressive. The arms are looking a little bit stiff. But, they did a really good job blocking everything out so far. They're the only team that has ice. They did a mix medium. Ice and snow. So, I'm excited about that. Uh, excuse me. Uh, are you Judge Andre and Judge Sue? - That's right. - Hey, you're Kermit! I sure am. Uh... You know, I was talking to the mayor about helping out, and I thought that, uh, I'd make a great judge. You know, in case you two can't agree on something, - I... I can help break the tie. - A tie? Yeah. You know, like, if one of you says, "tomayto" and the other says, "tomahto." Well, I'd be the tiebreaker. - I say tomato. - I say tomato too. Oh. And I say "tomahto." Uh. Yeah. Not a great example. But you get the idea, right? Well, as much as we'd love to work with you, Kermit... - Uh. - We're not sure that'd be fair. Do you have any experience in snow carving? Oh. Well, I once had an ice cube that melted into the shape of a dinosaur. Does that count? - Um. Not really. - Uh... Oh. Look, I... Guys, I live in a swamp. And I know nothing about snow carving. Mud carving? I'm your frog. Yeah, but you know, it sounds like snow carving is something that I should leave to you two experts, huh? We really appreciate you trying to help us. Yeah, I guess there's just not a big call here for a singing, dancing frog. - You sing and dance? - Sure. Watch this. Never took a lesson. Then we know just who you should go see. - The town carolers! - The town carolers! Oh, that's a great idea. Where can I find them? You can't miss them. They'll be in the town square. They'll be dressed in green and bright tomato red. - Oh. "Tomahto" red, you say? - That too. - Good luck, Kermit. - Well, thanks, Judge Andre and Judge Sue. I'm off to join the carolers! - He wants to help so bad. - I know! Lisette? - Hey, Vivi, how's it going down there? - It's going well. I'm just pulling out some of the negative space between these presents and Rocket's chest. - Nice. - Trying to thin him down a little bit. Our sculpture has a ton of negative space. Beneath Rocket, beneath the presents. We have arms that are out. - Yeah, exactly, so... - We're really defying gravity. The challenge with a lot of negative space like we have in our sculpture is the opportunity for everything to collapse suddenly and... and permanently. Ah, permanently. Once I work through here and get the neck a little bit narrower, I'm sure it'll be a little bit more sensitive, so... - Yeah, all right. - So, don't stand up too fast. - I will not stand up at all - There you go. We're trying to make this pillar into like a... Make it look like a rock. - Uh, and... Yeah, yeah, just big... - Mm. The big rocks. The big... Okay. - ...kinda bulky boulders. - Stone-looking. Stone, Okay. We kinda get it started like this. Now, there's one facet and let's say next time, dig in underneath a little bit, and then come up, like so. And then that pops out, and now we've got a nice little undercut there. Man, you know, I can really relate to this. - The Lion King, me being a military vet. - Right. It's more so like, you know, me going off by myself. - I served ten ye... I did ten... - Hold on. - Oh, man. - I know, baby. It's okay. I fought in the war in Iraq. On the whole other side of the world, you're leaving your family. I mean... I suppose that's kinda what's in the details, right? Not really knowing if you're gonna come back. Yeah. Yeah. The part of the movie where, you know, he disappeared and he was on his own, he had to find his way. You know, going out. And I don't know no one, and it's just me. I left my family at home. Going out by yourself. You know, that was kind of scary. But then, like Simba, once I came back home, you know, you home now. You amongst your pride. You're safe here. I mean, I made it back safely, but... a lot of people. You know, a lot of… lot of… a lot of guys didn't. I mean, being here with... with them, we flow together, we... we trust each other. If he's slacking... I'mma pick up his slack. If I'm slacking, he's gonna pick up my slack. It's... it's amazing, the fact that we're actually just able to do this together. Who else would you wanna be here with? You know what I'm saying? Yes! - It's cold enough out now. - Yeah. We can start to work on those chains. It's an integral part of the Marleys. We need to get a lot of chains going, and we need to get a lot of wrapping around them. Absolutely. - We have to get the slush just right. - Yes. We can't have it too wet or it looks like ice. If it's too dry, then it won't pack together and won't stick. - So, there's a very fine line. - And then we'll pack it into our mold. Press it down. - Oh, man! - And it comes out. We get that nice chain out there. Each of the links have to be completely white. They have to be hard enough and we have to actually make a cut in a few of them to link them all together. So, it's a very complicated process. There it is. Ninety-nine more. - Your first one. - Let's do it. You wanna figure out these eyelashes with me? So, what we're gonna do, we're gonna shave it down. Kinda form the shape of an eyelash, you know? It kind of curls up. So, that I think this is gonna be perfect, gives us enough room. - Let's go look at her face and just... - Okay. - Compare the size... - The size. And make sure we have the right size block. You can kinda start from the end. Wow. - Do something like that. - And just chisel around? - Yeah. - Okay. And we'll want it to be nice and round, so... - Yeah - that's gonna grab the judges' attention. Okay. I'm gonna go stand right here... - Oh. - And I'm gonna do his face. - How's it going up there? - It's going good. Honestly, I'm getting a little bit of space - between his neck and his shoulder. - Heck, yeah. How's it going over there with the ribbons? It's good. I'm... working as hard as I can to try to get this as thin as possible. Time is running out so quickly. It is cold. It's dark. We're all exhausted. It looks really good so far. - Yeah, thank you. - Yeah. It's like, "I don't know if I can do this." But we're all here it's like, "No, you can. You got this." And, so, I think all of us really draw out the best in each other. How much longer you think you need up there? I think we're gonna be out here all night, honestly, - to get this done. - Yeah. - Right. - I've got a lot of these to go. - I think it'll totally be worth it. - Yeah. - This is looking so good. - It's looking... it's looking so good. These other teams are looking amazing. Where did they come from? First of all, let's talk about the Snow Voyagers. Do you see how much they have up? - And they're kind of on top right now. - It's crazy. Everybody's doing amazing. But to us, - we feel like we're going to win this. - Yes. So, we're working hard to reveal something amazing. This is gonna be the best. We are Best in Snow. I just want to make sure Santa can see it. - It's so beautiful. - It doesn't matter where it hits, - it's a nice bright light. - Mm-hmm. I love these style of lights. - Now, that the skull is open... - All right. Imagine what that's gonna look like when both are in there. - It's the perfect shape. - You light them up, it's gonna be... - Yeah. Doesn't it look real? - Yeah. Everyone's gonna be like, "Oh, my God." "Look at that skull." - And these right here... - It's gonna light it up. Are perfect to light up the stage, right? - Lights in. - It's like this challenge was made for us. - The stage lights... - This fits me perfectly. - It's literally perfect. - Yeah. So, tomorrow is the judging and we still have a ton of work ahead of us. We're gonna have to carve all through the night. We're gonna have to put in every last ounce of strength that we have. We've got a ton of work left and we're going to be carving literally all night if we don't get back. So, let's put 'em away and come back to this later. Yes, ma'am. - We'll worry about this later. - Do it! Close it up! - Let's go! - Yeah, Coco. Let's get this out of here. - Yes! Awesome. - You ready? Carlos, - you ready to be here all night. buddy? - Oh, yes. Yes. All night. That's what I like to hear. Cocos, you ready for all night work? Hey, how about you stop talking and get to work? - You still feeling good up there? - Yeah. - We're gonna be out here a while. - Yeah. - I agree. - Sleep's overrated. Welcome to the Coco cam. The whole back of our block melted and then refroze during the day. So, we have to redo our entire back design. We're trying to turn the logo into some sort of skull and maybe some flowers and other things from the movie. I'm a little tired, but we're gonna kill this. We're gonna do great. Everybody kind of has, like, this electric sense of panic that in the morning we have to be done. We're up late. It's past midnight. All night long. Until we get it done. Period. Green Team don't quit. - How are you feeling? - Amazing, it's party time. This my team, what else I'mma do? - Nothin'. - Go to sleep? Mm-hmm. Each of us are tapping into our game night experience. - That. Oh, yeah! - So, I'm looking at every single sculpture like, "It's on!" Ashley, what's going on over here? - We're adding on... - Whoa! - Va, va voom! - These eyelashes. I think we're gonna be the last one standing tonight. We're definitely prepared to stay later than the Bah Humbugs. It is almost three in the morning and everyone is still working. Anybody want some coffee? It's from Mexico. No, I've only got ninety-nine more chain links to go, so. How long does it take you to make a chain? - About twenty minutes. - How late are we gonna be here? - Seventeen hours. - Let's do it. Let's do it. Feeling... tired. I feel exhausted and caffeinated. - It's frozen. - She's crazy. Oh, my God. We need sleep. We need to wake him up. Not sure where he went, but... Yep, there he is. Hey, everybody! I don't know about you, but we're absolutely freezing. What do you say we go take a walk around Snowdome to warm up? It's the middle of the night. We're all freezing. All the teams are out there working their butts off... and I think, maybe, you know what? This might be the perfect time for all of us to come together, even if for a minute, to help warm up and take a little parade around Snowdome. It's beautiful because everybody came together. It was just a beautiful moment. All right! What did the snow carvers do next? The same thing we need to do. Finish with the details. I'll put on the on the peppermints Oh, I ate some of the peppermints, and some of the gumdrops, and a lot of the sprinkles. - Where's the rest? - Right here. - Gus, you animal! - Gus! You know what? It's okay. Just like those sculptors from the magical village, we'll improvise. Oh! We can use Sunny's dog treats. I'm sure he won't mind. Ew. Is Dad gonna be okay? Good morning to all of you teams On the first day of carving We welcomed all you teams You chose what your sculptures would be On the second day of carving You shoveled, shaped, and scraped Kermit arrived Then your sculptures Began to take shape Look at Rocket On the third day of carving You needed to add lights Weather was warm, no sign of storm And you worked very late into night It gets dark at night Now, the fourth day of carving You've got to go, go, go Give it all you've got It's your last chance And at the end One of you will be Best in Snow Welcome to day four. Um, it's Christmas Eve! The final day of the Best in Snow competition. Um, tonight, the judges will choose our winner. Yay! I know you teams were working through the night to get done and must be exhausted. I... I barely slept myself, uh, because of my neighbor's yippy little dog. And I'm excited to see your finished sculptures, of course. But there's no time to waste. You need to finish your sculptures quickly before time's up. So, let's get going. And you know what I always say, good carving to all. Better together! Come on! - Oh. - Okay! It was a late night last night. We're all tired. We're all beat, but we got chain links that need to be done. - Yeah. - We need to get Gonzo done. We need to get more details on the sled. - We need to get working on the cave. - Yep. We gotta work on the lighting. We got a lot of stuff to do. - Yes, we do. - Got it. Final day. I know we're tired. We pushed through the night, but we still got a little bit more detail to do. So, you guys think we got this? - Absolutely! - Yes! Yes, we ready to go? - Yes! - No, we ain't tired. Bring it in! Coco's on three! One, two, three. Coco! Let's go! We're so close, just a couple hours left. Everyone know what they're doing? I'm gonna be on the mouth working on Rocket. I'm working on these presents and ribbons. I got the tail and this present back here. - I'm working on the feet. - Let's do this! - Let's do it. Yeah! - Yeah! - All right. - Go! Today is really the finishing up of those details. - Yep. - The refining of the leaves... - Yep. - The wave, the flowers. All that good stuff. Let's sharpen, let's shave, let's finesse. Let's do it. Thanks for powering through the night. Appreciate it. Yeah. We got a lot to do still. We got a lot done last night. Pretty much the main focus now is those little blades of grass that we're gonna install. - Okay. - So, that's gonna take everybody to get done. We'll get started right now. - Let's go. - All right. Too much talking already, Hakuna Matata. - Yeah. - One, two, three. - Hakuna Matata! - Let's go! All right, everybody. It's go time. Let's hustle. There's just, like, ten million, like, tiny little things that need to get done. Just like, every single little thing that I look at, I'm like, this could be, like, perfected in some way. I only want to win. I didn't come here to be a failure. Our original plan was to have a bunch of chains everywhere. We weren't able to make as many chains as we wanted because of the consistency of the snow due to the weather. If we needed a hundred, we made two hundred. And I think we broke about a hundred fifty, so, we just got to be gentle putting these last ones on. - Danny, you ready? - Yep. Okay, moving away. If we can pull this off, it'll definitely be a showstopper. - Hey, Rachel. - Yeah? - I'm trying to trim up these lashes. - Oh, yeah. We stayed up really late on day three, and now we're really tired, and it feels very stressful because we are unsure of a few things if we're going to get them done. - Do you think that looks okay? In line? - Mm-hmm. It does. I like how thin you're getting them, too. Awesome. I'll keep going on this one. Gotta go! Gotta go! Gotta go! Gotta go! Are we gonna make this? Oh, yeah. That's a perfect blade of grass. Perfect blade. Everyone's doing good so far. Not a single bust. I like it. Why would we sporadically put grass everywhere? Hey, if you don't wanna be on the team, you just say the word. Paul said, "Not today." Whether we're claimed Best in Snow or not, I feel like I already won. We got to spend this time together, building something that means so much to us. I got to spend this time with Reaghan and doing this with her, it just, it... it warms my heart. It's just an overwhelming, loving experience that we're gonna have forever between us. One hour left in the competition, everyone. That's sixty minutes left to finish carving. Which is three thousand six hundred seconds for those who wish to cut down in that manner. Good carving to all! One hour! One hour! No way. No way. No way. Let's get through this. We gotta keep going. Don't panic. But I'm panicking. Oh, my God. - Come on, no breaks... - No breaks. Keep going... - no breaks, no breaks. - Keep going. - Is that enough or you need more? - More. No breaks. Wanna get under his crotch and smooth out some of those little ridges with this guy? I'm scared under here. My heart is racing, and I can't move enough snow quick enough. Let's go, Coco's! I'm in a panic. I'm nervous. Hey, Ron, real, real light. Super light. I am a little bit stressed out because I'm trying to get Gonzo finished. It's nose to the grindstone, you know? Nose to the grindstone. We're so close, you guys. - Hurry. - Let's go. Quick. Competition's finally ending Thirty seconds left, we're counting down Everyone we are commending But a single team will win the crown Hurry up the clock is ticking Fifteen seconds till you stop Soon the judges will start picking Then they will decide which team's on top Ten seconds is all that's left now Eight seconds until you're done Six seconds so finish up now... Five and four and three and two and one Tools down, teams. Tools down. Bring it in! Bring it in! When I built this team and put it together, I never expected us to do as well as we did. We knocked it out of the park, I believe. Well, it's been a lot of hard work. And I just love these guys and um... I can't. We love you. It's all right. Bring it in. Bring it in. I'm just, kinda like, hit by this emotional train. - Of like, "Oh, my God, we've done it." - Mm-hmm. "How did we do this? It's done." I just couldn't be any prouder of you guys, you know. Sorry. I never thought you'd be the girl that cries in Snowdome. Yeah, exactly. - We made it! - Don't knock over the guitar! Whoo! We came into this competition as two families. We're leaving as one family. Honestly, like, we're all walking out of here surprised what we accomplished. We're proud of ourselves, and I think we walked out as better people because of it. One, two, three, Snow Voyagers! I am so proud of our sculpture. We completed this massive object in four days. We're all friends still. Being here with these ladies... has made me realize that we need to spend more time together. We need to make time for each other. Take trips. Even if for some reason we don't win... - I'm crying. - We've already won! - That's right. - I know. - I totally agree. - We have already won. We did it. This is definitely a new Christmas memory for us. For one, it taught us to do something different for Christmas. You know, we get so stuck in the hoopla of the world that we don't really get to enjoy... the true meaning of Christmas which is family and friends. Giving more than you receive. Sharing experience with the people that you love. That's Christmas. Great job, everybody! Good job! Gather around, everyone. Gather around. After four days of intense, nonstop, incredible work, the snow carving is complete! Now, it will be up to the judges to decide your fate. Now, please, head back to your cabins to get some rest before tonight's festivities where a winner will be crowned. All right. Goodbye, Ron! Goodbye! Goodbye, guys! You know, my... my grandfather's name is Ron. I should call him. Yes, yes. Oh... Uh, uh, excuse me, uh, you must be the town carolers. - Hi, Kermit, hi! - Hi, there! I hear you might have a spot for a singing, dancing frog? Of course! Well great, I'm here and I am ready to be a caroler. Great! The more the merrier! One problem. Well, no rehearsal? Uh, don't worry about it. I can fake it. No. You see, Kermit, the problem is... is that we just sang our last song. The competition's over. All that's left is to pick the winner. - Oh, uh. Oh. - Ooh, why don't you - join us for tonight's celebration? - Yeah. - Really? - Sure. Everyone's gonna to be there. And you get to see the amazing sculptures light up. Wow! Hey, throw in a snow cone and I'll be there! All right, the teams are done, the lights are lit, and it's time for our final walkthrough for judging. You ready? Oh, I'm ready! Ready to be amazed. - Yeah! - Let's go. The Bah Humbugs! Woo-hoo! Look at that. His arms are up, they're flying down the that hill. I would be terrified if I was on that sled, but it captures such great movement. You know, that sled's even big enough for me. I dig it. - A lot of detail in there. - Yeah. They did a good job, but at the same time, I see one of the chains broke. Shall we look around - and see what they have on the back side? - Let's look around. Oh, wow! - It's Gonzo and Rizzo! - Wow. You got little surprise characters back here. - I dig it. - The characters back here really brings it into, like, a 360 design. - Look at the trees. - The trees are a really good solution for supporting the back side. What I really do like that they took a little extra effort was... was making the ice pond. That took a lot of work to dig this out. Very creative. And also, this little " no fishing" sign. And it's amazing. I like it. - So, on to the next? - Not tripping over the sign. Wow! Here we go. Oh, my gosh! - The Rocket Queens. - Rocket Queens. Aw, Baby Groot. I like how they used that light to go all around. - Yeah, to light to up. I love it! - Mm-hmm. And there goes those bows - I was talking about. - Mm-hmm. And you see one is already broken. I mean, they're pretty delicate. I'm gonna take a look around at Rocket. - Look at... - They did it! Look at that. They got underneath there and carved out those legs. Yeah, that's a lot of work they had to do. Yeah, I was really worried about his legs being able to support all that weight, but it looks like they have this present supporting - and this tail supporting. - Now, this is a bow. I'm impressed. Oh, look. Blue lights in the rocket. - Huh. Pretty clever. - Cool. Mm-hmm. - Next one? All right. - All right. - Hakuna Matata! - Here we go. Hakuna Matata! - Don't have to worry about a thing. - Oh! Well, actually they do have to worry about us, so... I'm worried about stepping on those on those little grass things. And I'm looking at little Timon, right here. Nala, Simba, Rafiki, Mufasa. Well, they got all the characters in there. They put a lot of effort into this. Oh, yeah. I really like Pumbaa. I like how his hand's raised up. And he's got his little tusks there. - Shall we walk around to the other side? - Yeah, let's check it out. Do you know what I'm really, really impressed by? Is the amount and number of characters they have. I didn't think they were gonna make it, - and they delivered. - Yeah. The actual footprint is huge. And this is that back part of Mufasa, that big cloud. That look like a cloud? I think, they spent a lot more attention to the detail in front - and not so much to the back. - I agree. - On to the next? - All right, yeah, let's go. Move on. Move on. Move on. - Coco's Carvers. - Coco's Carvers. Wow! Look at those festive lights. Now, Sue, if you remember, this was an emotionally-charged team. They had a lot to prove. So, you walking up to this... Wow. Yeah, they really captured the love. - Look at those details. - Look at Hector, back there. I mean, look at the emotion that they captured in Miguel's face. - Look at him. - I know! I love the lighting placement. And really, it's seven sides of a sculpture. It's the outside three, and then you have the four sides here. So, it's amazing that they got that much surface area done. To achieve all these details in such a short period of time, you can tell they really work well together as a team. Oh, cool! Wow. The lighting kind of missed the mark on these a little bit. Yeah, you're talking about these little globe things... - Exactly! - Right? I like what they did here where they put the light inside, so, it's like light coming from inside the city. But these guys, these lights here, they just stuck them there. All right, let's check out the back side. - Oh! - That's impressive. Mm-hmm. Shall we take a look on this side? - Sure. - Right before we go - over to the last sculpture. - Okay. Pepita looks incredible. Really delivers the wow factor. I like it. This is gonna be tough. Oh, this is gonna be such a hard decision. - One more. - Okay. Last one. - Oh, wow. Snow Voyagers. - The Snow Voyagers. These are our ladies in blue. We talked about simple and how complicated it can be. They have to nail it. - Did they hit that mark? - I think they did a really good job capturing that emotional moment right there at the focal point of their sculpture. It really embodies "better together." I really like how they use the light to represent the heart of Te Fiti. It also shows all the emotion in her face. And I like movement in her hair too. - Wow. - They cut through under her head. Wow! That's impressive. And they've got all the detail around the back. That flower has great detail in the petals. But the others are a little bit lacking. But great execution on the front side. - Great simplicity. Great emotion. - I agree. It's a tough decision. You ready to make it? - Let's do it. - Let's go. Welcome back, teams. And thank you to everyone for being a part of this incredible event. By working better together, you have brought great joy and amazement to the village of Snowdome. Yeah! You know, I... I say this every year but this truly, truly was the best year yet. Aw. You all did a phenomenal job and you made me so proud. And if I can make you all winners, I would. And the truth is I probably could because I am the mayor. But that wouldn't be fair now, would it? Anywho... that's why we have our esteemed judges. Yeah! Oh, and look, as tradition would have it, it's snowing on the night of the closing of the competition. Snowdome! Snowdome! All right. I... I know this wasn't an easy decision, and you deliberated long and hard. All five teams worked tirelessly and created sculptures that embodied our theme, "better together." Let's all say it. Better together! Ah! Alas, but two teams went above and beyond and were both in consideration for the top honor. And I have the results, right here. All right. These two teams are... Coco's Carvers! And the Bah Humbugs! Both teams did amazing. But ultimately, the trophy for Best in Snow can only be bestowed up on one team. They will join a long list of historic winners. Beginning with 1947's Yule Tools. They were great! 1948's Blizzard Brunch. I loved them too. And I'm now realizing listing them all would take too long. Anywho... let's get to it. As honorary mayor of the village of Snowdome, we declare this year's Best in Snow... Coco's Carvers! Congratulations, Coco's Carvers! You are the Best in Snow! Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Thank you, judges. Now, tell us all, how does it feel? This is just an emotional moment for... for all of us. Especially for me and my son. I lost my mother and this... this is dedicated to her in her memory. - Oh. - Just like in the movie Coco, we remember... people from our families, and when they cross to the other side you will never forget them. Just like this moment right now, we'll never forget. And neither will we. We will hold this moment in our hearts forever! - Congratulations, Coco's Carvers. - Yeah! I am so happy for you. And thank you to everyone. Thank you to our team carvers, and a special thanks to our friend Kermit the Frog! - All right! - Kermit, I... I'm so sorry - we couldn't find a way for you to help. - Oh, well, that's all right. Hey, maybe next time I can be mayor. - Oh, I... I don't think so. - Oh, uh, - and you could be governor, all right? - Brilliant! Once again, thanks to you all, uh, uh, goodnight. Wait, wait, good night? Mayor, you can't... you can't be serious. Is that the end? That is the end, Kermit. Finished. Finito. Fertig. - Well, you... you can't end like that. - We can't? No, I mean, I may not know snow business but I do know show business. You need a big finish. A slam, bang musical finale! - Yes, after all it is Christmas Eve. - Yeah. Nothing says "better together" like a big, splashy musical number, right? - And we're all dressed for it. - That's right. Except you, Kermit. - What? - What are you going to wear? Oh, well, I was thinking I'd go au naturel. Oh. That won't do. Uh, wardrobe! Oh, yeah, Oh, yeah... - What do you think, Mr. Mayor? - Oh. That's perfect, Kermit. - That's the spirit! - Yeah, that's right. Haul out the holly Put up the tree Before my spirit falls again Fill up the stocking I may be rushing things But deck the halls again now - For we need a little Christmas - Right this very minute - Candles in the window - FROSTIFER: Carols at the spinet Yes, we need a little Christmas Right this very minute It hasn't snowed a single flurry - But Santa, dear, we're in a hurry... - But Santa, dear, we're in a hurry... - Come on, y'all! - We're really rocking that, aren't we? Yes, we are! I love a holiday key change. Here we go! Climb down the chimney Turn on the brightest string of lights I've ever seen Slice up the fruitcake It's time we hung some tinsel - On that evergreen bough - On that evergreen bough For I've grown a little leaner - Grown a little colder - FROSTIFER: Grown a little colder Grown a little sadder Grown a little older And I need a little angel Sitting on my shoulder We need a little Christmas now For we need a little music We need a little laughter Need a little singing Ringing through the rafter Yeah, we need a little snappy Happy ever after We need a little Christmas Little Christmas - Need a little Christmas now - Christmas now Yeah! - Wow. - I love singing with you, Kermit. Wow, that was great, Mr. Mayor. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas to all! This means absolutely everything to us. To me, to my family, to their family. We came. We saw. We carved. Now, we're Best in Snow! And every holiday, the magic of that little town continues to light up our hearts with hope. - My only hope is that Dad's okay. - I know he is. - How do you know? - I... I just know it. So cold. Wait! Am I imagining that, or do you see it too, boy? The snow globe. We're home, Sunny. - Daddy! - Papa! Come here! Sunny! I just knew you'd make it! I'm so glad you're home. Did you get what you needed? Of course. Merry Christmas, family. - Sunny! - Sunny! Excuse me, penguins. Have you seen the carolers? That a way. Okay thanks a lot, Peggy. As the honorary mayor of Snowdome, my work is never done. Such mayoral duties include, uh, planning the snow carving competition, of course. Yeah. And then there's, uh, deciding which moose will lead the winter parade. Of course, there's which moose will lead the summer parade. It is often the same moose. You wanna interview me? Okay, sure. I am happy to be interviewed. Okay. All right here, I'm just gonna take a seat. Oh. This seat's really low. Think we can, uh... You could, uh... Just get me like a booster chair or something or a telephone book? If we still have telephone books? No? Uh, good grief. Best in Snow was filmed on location at Keystone Resort in Keystone, Colorado.
