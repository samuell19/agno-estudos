Hey, we still on for poker Saturday night? You know it. I'll take your money any time. Will there be anything else today, Harry? Nope, just the deposit. Thanks. Uh, they say it's supposed to rain a little later. - Do you guys need a lift home? - Oh, no, we're good. My sister's gonna pick us up. - Okay, next time. - Bye-bye. Welcome back, DRIVER 031077. Let's start our engines and make some money. Yes, let's do that. You have a new request from passenger Dollarz4daze, in 3.7 miles. Okay. Here you go. You're all set. Passenger Dollarz4daze left you a 3% tip. Yeah, that sounds about right. This is the train to Babylon. The next station is Wantagh. Thank you again, Harry. I should be getting my car back next week. Well, I can't imagine my mornings without my favorite passenger. Ah, you're so sweet. Okay, Mrs. G. You have a lovely morning. Thank you. You too, Harry. Okay. Passenger Kittykitty49 left you a five thumbs up rating and a 75% tip. Keep tipping like that, you're not gonna be able to afford those repairs. You have a new request from passenger Montauk77 in 200 feet. 200 feet. Passenger is within 50 feet. Hey there. Did you call for a ride? Hello? Yeah, I did. Are you Montauk... 77? Yeah. Well, that's my mom. She's coming with me. Okay. Where are you guys headed? There's no destination plugged in. Montauk Point. I should've guessed that. Uh, that's fine and everything, but Montauk's about 100 miles or so and it says here that your mom's payment method has expired. So, I mean, if it's a matter of money, I can get you down to Point Lookout, or Jones Beach in 10 minutes. - Be a whole lot cheaper. - No. We need to go to Montauk. I have money. $200 cash. Well, the company doesn't let me take cash. Company? The company takes, like, 75%. Well, more like 80, actually. Ah, you know, I... I would really, honestly, - but I can't just... - Can't what? Sign out for the day? Call in sick? Come on, I seriously doubt you're making $200 a day doing this. I want to help you out, kid, really. But, I... I mean, I'm in the middle of my shift, and I can't, you know? Wh... what are you doing? Passenger has cancelled their ride. Now you just lost $200. Or did you? Driver has signed off. Goodbye. All right. We can leave whenever you two are ready. We're ready. Listen, I, uh, I don't mean any disrespect or anything, but... I'm really not supposed to take any, you know, kids without a... a parent or guardian with them. And you're not supposed to be taking cash fares offline either. Are you? No, I suppose not. And my mother is with me. My mistake. All right. Here we go. It's a long ride out to Montauk. I don't know if you feel like talking, but... if you do, I don't mind listening. My name's Harry, by the way. And you are? Liz. Is anybody meeting you out there, Liz? Family? No. Brothers, sisters, father? I don't have a father. Only child, huh? Just you and your mom? I was an only child, too. Wasn't so bad. Except when something breaks in the house, right? I used to try to blame the dog. The problem was, we didn't have a dog. Okay. Is this your car? Ah, no, actually, it's not. Did you steal it? Steal it? No. Well, you just said it wasn't yours. It's not. It's the company's car. But I have an agreement with them and they allow me to use it between my shifts. It's a little cheaper for me than owning. Seems this job would be a whole lot easier with your own car. Yeah, well, I never had much use for a car, living in the city all those years. You lived in the city? Forest Hills, Queens. Smells like shit in here. You ever clean it? Yeah, I do. Every day, actually. Some passengers smell better than others, I guess, right? Why do you have a toothbrush in your cup holder? So my breath doesn't smell as bad as my car apparently does. Don't you mean the company's car? Bathroom break. - You hungry? - No, I'm fine. Okay. Everything all right back there? I'm fine. Shouldn't be too much longer now. Is there a particular spot you're looking for in Montauk? The lighthouse. I haven't been out here in years. Your mom... did she ever take you out here? When I was younger, yeah. This was her favorite place. She loved the lighthouse. Wanted to live in one someday. You know what the locals call this place? They call it The End. I never really understood why. It seems too dark and depressing for such a beautiful place. Your mom... was she sick? Cancer. My wife, she died of cancer a couple of years back. Brain cancer. She had surgery, went through chemotherapy. She was in remission for almost a year and... we thought she was good. Is that why you moved out to the island? Mostly, yeah. I think we just needed a fresh start. We? Tyler and I. Ah, my wife's son. You have a son? How old is he? Little younger than you. What are you, like, 15? 16. - In a couple of weeks. - Yeah. Tyler's, uh, he'll be 13 in June. Where is he now? - In school or something? - Yeah. Yeah, he goes, uh, to boarding school, actually, upstate. Why does he go to boarding school? Just a good fit. It's a good school. He's a good student. Do you ever see him? Yeah. On holidays mostly. When he comes home. And where is that? Where's home? Um, we usually spend the holidays at his Uncle Frank's house. Why not your house? Ah, it's just easier that way. Here. here we go. That's a good picture of the two of us. Your wife. She was pretty. She was. Yeah. Shame she had to go die on you like that. You should probably keep your eyes on the road and off your phone. Listen, Liz. Liz! Wait! Liz! Liz! I don't feel right leaving you out here all alone like this. Goodbye, Harry. Wait! Liz! Liz! Yeah, yeah. Yes, this is Driver 031077. Harry George. Yes, I was waiting for contact information on a passenger with the username Montauk77. Fine, if you can't give me the name, can you give me an address for some frequently used pickups or destinations? Hi, I'm calling from St. Charles Hospital. We're looking for some information. We're trying to track down the next of kin for a recently deceased Jane Doe, that we believed lived in your complex there, along with her 15 year old daughter. Okay, can you text that list to this number? Liz! Liz, Liz. - Liz, don't do this. - Why? He left us with nothing. - I know. I'm sorry. - You don't know shit! You don't know what it's like to grow up without a father in your life. You don't know it. You left us. You left us with nothing. You put us through so much, Harry. You broke me, you broke my mom. - Please. - You broke us, Harry! You broke us! So... what should we talk about? Any suggestions? How is that burger? Well, I don't know about you, but... I have a few questions. And I'm sure as many as I have, you probably have a few more, so, shoot. I mean, go ahead. All right, look, if you're not going to start, then... then I will. Why'd you leave? Is that what Maddie told you? That I left? Maddie? Nobody called her that. I did. Her mother did, too. She used to hate it. What else did she say about me? Hmmm, let me think. Oh, yeah, she said you were a thief. She called me a thief? Yep, that's right, Harry. She said you were a thief and a liar and that you left us when you found out she was pregnant with me. That's what she told me about you. But you still haven't answered my question. Why did you leave? Liz, I don't know what you heard about why I wasn't around, but I didn't leave anybody. Oh, bullshit, Harry. And I guess you're not liar either? Look, I... you know, I... I was a lot of things, all right? I was a screw up. I was an asshole. But I never lied to your mother, Liz. Okay? I... I'm not a liar. Fine. Then tell me the truth. The truth that you... The truth is, your mother left me. How dare you say that? Fuck you, Harry. Once you found out she was pregnant with me, you just took off and you left, and we never heard... No, That's not how it happened. - Yes, it is. - No, it's not. Look, when I found out that she was pregnant, you know, I got really scared. I did. All right? We were young. We were stupid. We had no money. We had no plan. We had nothing. I got really scared and I... I didn't leave, but I... I did something stupid and... when your mother found out, she packed her bags and she left. And she took you with her. Away from me. And that's the truth. So what'd you do? You cheat on her or something? No. No, I loved your mother very much. Then why would she leave? She told me that she could never love a thief. And that she refused to have her child raised by one. So, it's true, then. You are a thief. But I don't get it. If you loved her so much, why would you just let her - leave that easily? - I didn't. - Really? - No! And why should I believe a thief? Get up. I want to show you something. Open it. They're all unopened. What are all these? What are these? I'm forgetting. I wouldn't expect somebody from your generation to recognize the sentiment behind a handwritten letter. Let me tell you what these are. Okay? These are hours and hours... week after week... for three years straight... regretting who I was. These are missing your mother. Trying to make things right. These are begging, begging... to meet my child, whose name... whose name I just learned today. That's what these are. Okay, so don't tell me that I just left and never looked back. Because that's the lie. Look, I can't say that I've ever read a parent handbook or anything, but I'm pretty sure there's at least one or two pages about no weapons. So I'm gonna have to hold on to that gun. Look, Liz. Look, maybe we can... Wait, Liz! Liz! Wait, Liz! I don't know what I want to say right now. But I know I don't want to say goodbye. I don't know what you want from me. We can't just pretend like we have this history together. I'm sorry. Hi. Hey. How are you? Tired. Didn't sleep much last night. Yeah, me neither. I'm glad you called. Okay, now that we have everyone, what are we having for breakfast? Um, yeah. Uh, make it two of whatever she's having. Burger and fries. Medium rare. Yeah, uh, need that protein first thing in the morning, right? Okay, need anything to drink with that? Bloody Mary? Cold beer? Just water. Thanks. Two. Coming up. So what's up? You need a ride somewhere? No, um... I stole this from you last night. I hope you don't mind. I was just curious, and all. Yeah, well, um... some of this still belongs to you. Harry, I can't take your money. Besides, who sends $110 to a three year old? I'm pretty sure the $10 was for you and the rest was for your mother. I used to send her whatever I could, you know, whenever I could. Keep it. Put it toward breakfast. I hope you don't mind, I read the letter. Are all of them the same? Yeah, pretty much. And she never... No. I'm sorry I pulled a gun on you yesterday. Oh, that? I barely noticed. And down at the beach, you know, I wasn't gonna... I know. I know. Hey, you... You brought it for protection. That... that was smart. Unfortunately, I can't give it back to you. Why? What did you do with it? I got rid of it. I don't need anybody getting hurt. Is that why you called me here? You wanted it back? No, no, um... I actually wanted to ask you something. Okay, sure. Harry, are you homeless? You live out of that car, don't you? It's... it's... it's really not as bad as it sounds. I... I wouldn't call it being homeless. And that's why Tyler goes to boarding school and why you go to other people's houses for the holidays. It... it just works. It just works right now. I mean, he's doing really well in school and, you know, uh, fits in really well with my career. You mean as a driver? There are worse ways to make a living. Like being a thief. Liz, if you want to ask me something more directly, go ahead. In the letter... you were saying how you would do anything for me and my mom. Well, did you mean it? Yeah. Like, if I was to ask you for a favor... would you do it for me? I'm sorry, Harry. This is a mistake. Wait, wait, wait. Liz, wait, wait, no. No, wait, hold on a second. No, no. No, come on, come on, sit down. Come on, you didn't even have your breakfast burgers yet. Come on, please. I want to help. What do you need? I want you to help me rob a bank. Okay. Here's your breakfast. Enjoy. You want... You want me to what? I want you to help me rob a bank. Why do you need to rob a bank? - Because I need money. - Yeah, I figured that. But why do you need to rob a bank? I mean, how much money are we talking about? I was thinking, like, 50,000. - 50,000? - That's all. That's all. And why do you need $50,000? Because I need a fresh start. There's nothing left for me here. I figured I'd move to California, stay with my aunt for a little while until I can get my own place. I'll go back to school, get a job, maybe go to college. You want to go to college? Yeah. Maybe even get into nursing. That all sounds like a great plan. I mean, except for the whole bank robbery thing, but the rest... solid. But Liz... Ah, I mean, look, I know you feel desperate right now, but you're still so young. You still have so many of your own mistakes to make. You don't want to start off by making the same ones I did. That's why I need your help. Harry, I didn't just wander into your car yesterday out of nowhere. I tracked you down. You know, it may have been for the wrong reasons, but still, I found you, someone who could actually help me. And by somebody, you mean a thief. Right? Liz, I get it. You didn't grow up with a father, and you... You don't need one right now either. But what you're asking is... It's really dangerous. I don't know if I ever deserved a second chance with you, but if I did... I can't let it start this way. I'm sorry. Harry, I don't blame you for what happened. I mean, not anymore. But I can't give this a chance until I give myself a chance. I need to move on from this. We both do. I thought this could be good for the both of us... but I guess I'll find another way. Or I'll just do it myself. Wait, Liz. Hold up a sec. You sure you're turning 16 and not 36? Look, maybe there's still some way I can help you out. I'm not taking money from a guy living out of his car. Besides, you need this money as much as I do. Wait, me? What do you mean? - I mean your cut. - My cut? Yeah. Don't you know how this works? Wait a minute, start over. You want to rob $50,000 from a bank and move to California with it, right? Well, not the whole 50,000, but yeah. Well, if you don't need 50,000, then how much do you need? I figure 200 or 300 for a plane ticket, 3,000 or 4,000 for living expenses, and five or six for college savings. So probably about ten. That leaves $40,000. Yeah, that's your cut. $40,000? I know it's not that much, but I figured you'd get started on down payments. A down payment on what? On a home, for you and Tyler. I figured he'd much rather spend the holidays at his own house. Ooh, hold on a second. You're thinking about it, aren't you? You're thinking about it. You're thinking about saying yes, aren't you? Ooh, I can see it, Harry. Come on, it's a good deal for the both of us. Your mother used to use that same smile on me. So what do you say? When do you need to be out of your apartment? End of the week. Well, it's gonna take us a little longer than that to put a plan together. You serious? Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you! I'm gonna go to jail. Speaking of jail, I forgot to mention if we get caught, you're gonna have to take the blame. - Me? Why? - Because you owe me. Owe you? Owe you how? - I saved your life yesterday. - Saved my life? You were sticking a gun in my face. Yeah, but I didn't pull the trigger, so technically, I saved your life. If we're gonna rob a bank together, we gotta work on your logic skills. Good morning, West City Savings. This is Trish speaking. How may I help you? I think I found our mark. Our mark? Our mark. Yeah, our target. Person that we're going to end up... Whoa, what are you doing? I'm taking notes. No, no notes. Number one rule of thievery, absolutely no paper trails. Got it. Besides, you don't need any notes. This is a one time job. You understand? - Yep. - Good. But right now, just listen to me and try to keep up. - What does that mean? - What does that mean? It means homework. Homework? Ugh. The Bank Job, Baby Driver, The Sting, Point Break, Heat and Bonnie and Clyde. What, are you still looking to rob a bank or something? - No! - No! - It's, uh, for a, um... - Ah, uh, it's a school project. It's for a project. This is for school? Um, it's, um... it's a very progressive class. Thank you, thank you. Have a good day. What are we doing here? Before you can major in grand larceny, you have to minor in petty theft. In the laundromat, there's a woman working there. She's folding laundry behind the counter. And behind her is a blue bottle of fabric softener. Yeah, so? So I want you to go in there, I want you to go get it, and I want you to bring it back here. - What? - You heard me. Go on. Harry, I can't go steal from a laundromat. Well, why not? Because I just can't. You've seen this done in the movies a hundred times. Use a distraction, get in, and get out. - Easy peasy. - That's easy for you to say. Let me get this straight. You want to rob $50,000 from a bank, but you can't go steal some fabric softener from a laundromat. I thought you wanted my help. I do, but you know. Well, do you want my help or do you want me to just do it for you? Fine. Atta girl! Go get him! I got it. I got it. Congratulations. - Did you use the distraction? - No. No. I was too distracted. What are you waiting for? Get us out of here. Come on. But you're not done yet. What are you talking about? I mean, I want you to go take the fabric softener and put it back before she knew it was gone. Are you crazy? Liz, it's only fabric softener. You had no problem sticking a gun in my face a few days ago, if I remember. You're gonna keep bringing that up, aren't you? Getaway car leaves in 60 seconds. Clock's a-ticking, toots. Let's go. Go, go, go! So what happened? So what happened? She saw me coming through the door and she caught me, Harry, that's what happened. - Good. - Good? How is that good? It means you learned the first rule. Oh, what's that? How not to shit your pants? Never get caught. I thought no paper trails was the first rule. There are a lot of first rules. So, what's next? Do you want me to go knock over a lemonade stand or something? Ah, I was thinking maybe some ice cream. We might even pay for it. Harry, you don't think something like that could happen to us, right? Absolutely not. You sure? I'm more than sure. I'm positive. How do you know? Because we're Harry and Liz, not Bonnie and Clyde. We're not going on any cross-country bank robbery spree. We're knocking over one very small, federally insured bank for a very small amount of money. Trust me, we're not gonna be making any FBI top ten lists, and they're certainly not gonna be making any movie about Harry and Liz. I guess that makes sense. But still, I wish you hadn't gotten rid of that gun. Why? We're not going to be using any guns. What? Why not? Because guns pose a threat to violence, and a threat to violence changes everything. Including any pending charges if you get caught. Besides, I don't want anyone getting hurt. Even accidentally. So, what do you want us to do? Stick our fingers in our pockets and say "Give us all your money?" No. But kind of. Do you think this is a painting of a sunrise or a sunset? Your mother paint that? Yeah, after she was diagnosed. You know, I used to think it was a painting of the sun rising. But now I'm not so sure. I think the sun might have been going down. I agree. - Yeah? - Yep. How do you know? It's like the old saying, red sky at night. Red sky at night, sailors delight. A red sky by morning, sailors take warning. I think that painting is about hope. Hope for better weather. Hope for a better day. Probably hope for you. Those boxes that I packed... a lot of trophies in there. Are you a track star? I was, I guess. I had to quit when my mom got sick. You know, it's funny, I used to complain the whole season. Now I kinda miss it. And your aunt out in California. That's your mother's sister, Gina, right? Yeah. Those two always used to run hot and cold with one another. She ever make it out here? To see your mom, I mean? She didn't even know my mom was sick. They got into this huge argument a few years ago, and they never made up. You still kept in touch with her? She used to send me birthday cards and text every once in a while. Wanted me to come visit. I guess I should've told her my mom was sick. I was just hoping my mom would get better... so I wouldn't have to. You know, I was thinking, this plan of ours might require two drivers. You do know how to drive, right? - No. - No? We're gonna have to fix that, then. Hey, wait 'til you see this place that I booked. Oh, yeah? Does it have, like, pool and room service and all? Nah. Harry, you okay? Yeah. You? I'm a little nervous, but I know you know what you're doing. But, you know, it's still a little scary. I promise... everything will go just fine. I don't believe you. Something's up. What is it? I need to tell you something, but... I want you to know it doesn't change anything for me. Harry, what is it? Remember I told you your mother and I, we had our problems, even before she got pregnant. I was out of work. Put a real strain on us. I could've been more supportive. I found out your mother, she was... she was with somebody else. Not for a long time. I don't even think she loved him. What did you do? I got angry. I got real angry. And then, I don't know. I just... I felt like maybe I deserved it? But I wanted her to know that I knew. And when I finally got the nerve to sit her down and tell her... she started talking first. And that's when I found out she was pregnant with you. Did you ever tell her? No. Never. But what if the baby... what if it wasn't yours? If it meant your mother and I could be happy together again... it wouldn't have mattered. We have a big day tomorrow. Let's get some rest. Harry? You all right? Yeah, I just can't sleep. What was the stupid thing you did? What do you mean? The stupid thing that Mom left you for. She never forgave you. Your mom ever tell you about your grandfather's liquor store? No. I worked there out of high school. It's actually where I met your mother. We started seeing each other and... boy, he hated that. So, one day... the son of a bitch accuses me of stealing a case of wine. And I think it turned out to be this... new cashier that he had hired, and he knew it. Thing is, that he fired me anyway. Told your mother that he knew a thief when he saw one. I think he thought it would break us up. But we stayed together. At least for a while. Six months later your mother tells me that she's pregnant with you. And the next morning, I broke into your grandfather's liquor store and stole $7000 from the safe. So, what happened? Did you get caught? Not by your grandfather, no. But, your mother... she knew what I did. She knew where the money came from. She said... she said that her father was right about me all along. I don't get it, though. I thought she hated him. She did. But he was blood. He came first. You should try to get some sleep. I still can't sleep. It's just nerves, Liz. Trust me. Everything will go fine tomorrow. Well, but I keep thinking, you know, what if we get caught? I know we won't, but what if we do? What do you think they'll do with us? - Life in prison, maybe? - What? - Death penalty. - Harry. I'm joking. But I sure hope you don't mind wearing orange. Ah, what a beautiful morning. Be a shame to waste it. How should we spend it? Hm... do you feel like robbing a bank? That's a great idea. Can we stop for some burgers first? Why not? Bingo. That's our ride. The silver sedan with June Cleaver behind the wheel. Who the hell is June Cleaver? Wife of Ward, mother to Wally and the Beave. Never mind. That's our girl. Whoa! - Dad! - Oh, my gosh! Oh, my God. - Are you okay? - Yeah, no, I'm fine. - Thank you, thank you. - You're welcome. - Are you sure you're both okay? - Oh, yeah, oh, I'll be fine. Yes, we're fine. It's not easy getting a big guy like this around. Who're you calling big? Thank you so much. Oh, welcome. You sure you're okay? Oh, I'm fine. Just a little banged up. Okay, all right. Bye. Did you get 'em? Good girl. So, why do we need to do this again? Because. We don't want Mrs. Cleaver getting into any trouble, right? Those surveillance cameras, they're gonna be looking for license plates. And... we don't want her getting caught, or us getting caught, right? Right. Okay. Time to get you into makeup. There's nobody there yet. Should we go? Ain't quite time yet. Bank opens at nine. If my intel is correct, four tellers on the inside. They'll be starting their day with about $25,000 to $30,000 in their drawer. But the drive-thru teller, they have a line all of their own, and they start their day with 50 to 75 in their drawer, which makes this a one-stop shop for us. And we don't even have to leave the getaway car. - Pretty smart. - Pretty smart. Okay, let's get into character. Remember, we have to keep you completely anonymous, so keep your eyes shut the entire time so the teller can't tell what color eyes you have. Don't worry, you got this. Harry, I still don't understand. How're we gonna rob a bank without a gun? Remember the beginning of Pulp Fiction? Pumpkin tells Honey Bunny he knows this guy that once robbed a bank using just a cell phone. Hands the cell phone over to the teller, guy on the other end tells the teller they kidnapped this little girl, and if they don't do as they say, well, you know what happens. Well, what if the teller doesn't believe there even is a little girl? Well, it's a good thing we have a little girl with us, isn't it? A little girl that just happens to be the second thief. That's genius. Harry, you're brilliant. No, I'm not brilliant. Tarantino's brilliant. I just stole it from him. We did it! That was intense. Is your heart going a mile a minute? - Oh, man. - Oh, my God. That was great, right? What's wrong? All right, don't panic. There's a cop behind us. Oh, shit. - Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit. - Don't turn around. Keep your eyes ahead, keep your eyes ahead. Okay, look, it's just a regular traffic stop. - It's just a regular traffic... - We just robbed a bank! I need you to be cool, okay? - Are you cool? - No. All right, take that money, put it underneath the seat. And put those sunglasses on, too, okay? All right, we're gonna be fine. Just be cool. Liz. Trust me. Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God. All right, just calm down, okay? Just relax. You have to calm down. Morning, officer. Do I have a tail light out or something? I clocked you at 52 in a 40. Oh, sorry about that. I'm, uh, I'm usually pretty careful. Let me get your license and registration. Coming right up. Stay where you are, I'll be back in a moment. - Okay. - Oh, my God. All right, look, he doesn't know about the bank. If he did he would have pulled us out of the car immediately. - You think? - Absolutely. Just hang in there a little while longer, okay? This is a registered Hitch vehicle, is it not? Yeah, it is, sir. And is this one of your passengers? Uh, no, no. I'm, uh, I'm off-duty right now. Um, she's my niece. You mind removing those shades for me young lady? Ooh. That's quite a shiner you got there. You mind telling me how you got that? Oh, this? This is just makeup. See? Why are you running around looking like somebody beat the snot out of you? Uh, 'cause she's an actress. Yeah, um, for a school play. Are you trying to make a dupe out of me, young lady? No, no, not at all, um, it's... it's for the play. It's actually a musical. A musical. And what musical would that be? Rocky. Rocky? As a musical? Wow. What a great concept. Right? Yeah. Right. Right. Hey, yo Adrian. Yeah, that was a spot-on impression. But Adrian doesn't have a black eye. No, no, I don't play Adrian. What are you gonna tell me, you play Rocky? No. No, no, I play Apollo Creed. Yeah, um, it's a very progressive school. Consider that a warning. Break a leg, kid. Oh, my God. I need a shower. Got to wash the stress off of me. Hey, Harry? Yeah? Thank you. It's a good thing they didn't use any dye packs, huh? Something's wrong. What do you mean? There's only 15 thousand dollars here. Then it's yours. That wasn't part of the deal, though. Liz, it's not up for debate. This is yours. I want you to have it. But what about you? Like, what about the home for you and Tyler? Tyler and I will be fine. Good news. Not picking up too much chatter on the C.B. channels, but what I am hearing is that they might have got the color of the car, but not the make, and they think a girl might have been abducted somewhere between the ages of 17 and 23, maybe. But they're not even sure, so, no amber alert was ever even issued. That's good news, right? Did you hear me? We're in the clear. You should be excited. I am, but... But nothing, come on, why aren't you excited? Let's go, hey, look, look. We should be celebrating. We should go out, we should... We should do something, come on. Hey, wait a minute, didn't you say that your birthday's coming up? - Tomorrow. - Tomorrow? Oh, come on, this is too perfect now. We have to go out. We have to go out. Come on, no, no, we're getting up, come on, get up. I know the perfect place, and you're treating, moneybags. Me too. Okay, bye. How did it go? Good, I guess. I mean, she's upset, but she's excited to see me. Good. It's getting late, though. You've got a big trip tomorrow. Wait. I was thinking, one last movie. But I get to choose. So what are we watching? You'll see. Well, can't you give me a hint? Don't worry, it's not another heist movie. Horror movie? Nope. An old classic? Not too old. '80s, '90s? How many years? 16. Harry? I want you to make me a promise. I want you to stop blaming yourself and I want you to finally make a home for you and Tyler. You may not be his blood, but he's your son, and you're his father. He's lucky to have somebody like you in his life. And... and the fireworks kind of. So, I guess this is it. Yeah, I guess so. You don't have to get all dressed up for me. This? Nah, I got a little something I've got to take care of after this. Really? That sounds promising. Yeah, yeah. We'll see. How 'bout you? You all good? Yeah, I guess. A little nervous and all, but... you sure we're in the clear? I'm positive. Liz, promise me something: when you get to California, promise me the first thing you'll do is pick up your phone and give me a five thumbs up rating on the Hitch app. Look, I was thinking... maybe someone from my generation could actually appreciate a handwritten letter every now and then, you know? If they had someone to write to. That's funny, I was actually thinking the same thing. My dear Elizabeth, where should I begin? How about two weeks ago, 16 years after I first imagined you, you walk back into my life for the first time. And how do I find you? Grown and a little broken. With your mother's eyes and a soft soul not unlike my own. Oh, you also had a gun in my face. It's hard to miss the irony in this re-crossing of our paths. You found me using technology and social media, and then found me all over again in the handwritten letters that I had sent your mother years ago. I'm glad I kept that old shoebox, for more than one reason, but I'll get to that in a bit. For me, there will never be another stretch of time quite like these last couple of weeks. Coming from a person who's ridden the first car on many of life's twisted roller coasters, the ups and downs of the last 15 days have felt like one long, terrifying ride, and I never want it to end. On it, I experienced your laugh, and learned that it is one of the most beautiful sounds my ears have ever heard. And watching you grow on those home movies was unequivocally the most captivating sight my eyes have ever seen. I don't know what you want from me. We can't just pretend like we have this history together. I'm sorry. And the only pain that ever came close to that of losing my wife, I felt that first night I brought you home. I meant what I said that night, despite what uncertainty or even hurt might have been in store for either one of us. I didn't want to say goodbye, but the next morning you gave me a second chance, and I was damned if I wasn't going to do anything and everything to keep you near me for just a little bit longer, and with any luck, set you off on a path that you deserved after the hard journey you had already endured. That path is rooted in honesty, and I want your first steps to be true. In a few weeks, you should receive a package. It's a paternity test that includes my sample. I took it to heart what you said to me about family meaning more than just blood, but I also understand that one day you might feel differently, and will want to know the truth. And the truth is something that I will never deny you. At least, not ever again. This brings me to my confession: I am a liar. The truth is, I never was a thief. Aside from the seven thousand that I stole and then returned to your grandfather, I have never stolen a dime in my life. But when you came back to me that next morning, looking for the help of a seasoned criminal, I wanted nothing more than to play that role for you. You want me to what? Harry the Hitch driver might have missed his chance at playing the role of your father, but Harry the thief could watch over you, keep you safe, and make sure you didn't stray from that path you needed to be on, which is why I decided to lie to you. To play the role and to stage a bank robbery. You can rest assured, neither you nor I committed any crime. It was all fabricated. All fantasy. Remember June Cleaver? Oh, you're a saint. Thank you so much. - Thank you so much. - Are you sure you're both okay? Oh, yeah, oh, I'll... I'll be fine. Well, her real name is Mrs. G. Okay, Mrs. G. And she's a regular client of mine, and when I told her what I was planning, she was happy to play along and let me borrow her car now that it was fixed. They say it's supposed to rain a little later. Do you guys need a lift home? The bank you thought we robbed had actually been closed to the public several days prior during their relocation. The teller, Trish, she conveniently volunteered that day to oversee the final logistics of the move, and also to open the drive-thru window for one final withdrawal from one of her regular customers. The same regular customer who had driven her and her six-year-old son, Joey, to work and to day-care on rainy days for the better part of the last two years. Even the traffic stop was staged. The man you thought was a cop... Hey, we still on for poker Saturday night? Yeah, you know it. I'll take your money anytime. His name is Ed. He's a family man with an enormous heart and a terrible poker face. He's also a struggling actor who owed me a favor. Yeah, it was a little mean, but that's how I made peace with the whole "gun in my face" stunt. And now neither one of us will ever watch the movie Rocky the same way again. That brings me to the money. And if you haven't figured it out already, the cash was mine all along. Well, sort of. As you know, I wrote your mother every week for more than three years straight, and at any time I could afford it, I also sent along some money. Like I said before, I'm glad I held on to that old shoebox full of letters. I always knew one day I would use that money for something important. I came close to using it a few times, but could never bring myself to open a single one of those envelopes. Now, so you wouldn't suspect that I was up to something, I made sure the amount you thought we stole was in a perfect, even increment. There was a few hundred in change left over, and when I deposited that into my emergency savings account, I surprised myself with how much I had actually saved over the years, so I decided to start delivering on a promise I made you. But I'll get to that in my next letter. For now, I want to thank you. Not only for finding me, but for allowing me to find myself again, and for that I am forever grateful. Until next time, I leave you with all of my love. Harry. Wait, whose house is this? I'll give you one hint, it's not Uncle Frank's. So, what do you think? You must be the George family. We are. Well, let me be the first to welcome you to the neighborhood. Thank you very much. We're glad to be here. - Is this your boy? - Yes. This is my son, Tyler. I think you guys are really going to love it here. I think so, too. - Before I forget... - Oh, thank you. You have a nice day, Mr. George. Call me Harry. You want to do the honors? P.S. I really hope you don't view this whole con I pulled on you as just an elaborate handout. I know the last thing you wanted was to take money from a guy living out of his car. So, if you're upset with me for going to my own pockets to make you the mark, perhaps you could look at it from a different perspective. You see, I didn't just give you the money, I bought something. I bought us a story. That night you said goodbye, you were right, we didn't have a history. But now... now we have a story. A story that began at Montauk. A story that began at the end. And if you ask me... it's the perfect place for our history to start.
