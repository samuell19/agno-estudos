- [Narrator] At the beginning of the war with Japan, Northern China fell into the enemy's hands. The Japanese proved to be harsh and tyrannical rulers, and they were hated by our people. New laws for public peace and order were brought in and the Japanese used these as an excuse to oppress us even more. (slapping) (man groaning) (blows thudding) - Hey, where did you get this? (man spitting) (blows thudding) (man groaning) (men guffawing) (wood clanging) (bright music) (drums beating) (fighters grunting) - Ha, Master Wu. Just arrived? Sakaminsie, he's in the hall. (fighters grunting) - Hai-chuan not back? - No, not yet. What do you want him for? - Nothing much. I'm afraid that he might be in trouble. He spends so much time away. - No need to worry, he can look after himself. - I hope so. - Yeah. - That kid is a tough little fighter. - Ha, ha, ha. (fighters grunting) - Hey, come on. - Ow, ow, ow, stop it, you're hurting me. - I'm just teasing you. - Go to hell! - Little brat, just wait. (slaps) I'll show you! (punch lands) - Oh, Chou, no! (slaps land) - Stop it, what's the matter with you? Are you all right? Shau Lung. Shau Lung. Shau Lung. - Master, now look what you've done, you're far too rough. - Hah, you have to be rough. He has to be taught some manners. (sighs) (grunts) (foreboding music) Oh Liao, remember don't tell Chou Hai-chuan. (cart rattling) (soldiers singing) (cart rolling) - Halt! Hey, you, show some respect! Salute us! - Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot. - Forgot? (punch landing) I'll show you forgot. (slap landing) (men fighting) (men grunting) (gunshot) - Ah! (man fighting) (man screaming in pain) (gunshots) - Get him! (man grunting and yelling) (fighting) (kick landing) (punches landing) (man hits ground) (cart continues rolling) (traditional music) (woman singing traditional song) - Master, come in, how are you? - Eight noodle squares. - Sit here, please, wait won't be long. (calls to waiter) (woman continues song) - Your noodles, sir. - Thank you. (woman ending song) (applause from crowd) - Good, good! - Cheung Ching Ching, welcome. - She's sings very well. Why don't you sing the song, 'Man, Two Girls' for all of us. Huh? - I'm sorry, I don't know Japanese songs. - Then sing '18 Touches.' - Mr. Chen, leave her. - Nah, I've come here to check your books. Get them out now. - Yes, yes. (man kicks table) - Uh, huh. - Let us go. - Get away. - Oh. - Sing. - I'm sorry, I can't. - Can't you? Good, I'll teach you then. (laughs) ♪ Well, first of all ♪ I'll touch your face ♪ It's really very fair ♪ Your skin looks so pale ♪ It's so soft to touch ♪ Secondly, I touch your body ♪ You got a lovely shape ♪ You curve in all the right places ♪ ♪ I'd really love to hold you ♪ Thirdly, now I touch your breasts ♪ ♪ I feel it my hands. - You just behave yourself. - Oh baby. (Cheung Ching Ching gasps) You're angry, huh? - Excuse her, Mr. Chin, she's just a child, and please... - Aw, shove off. (Cheung Ching Ching gasps) - Hey, you're staying here with me, yeah? We haven't finished the song yet. (men laugh) Hey, don't go away. - Mr. Chin, sir, here's the book. - Damn you, get out. - Yes, sir. Yes, sir. - And you. - Huh? - I mean you. - Huh? Me? I didn't do anything. - You'll do whatever I tell you. You don't know who you're talking to. - This time you've gone too far. I'll leave when I'm good and ready. - Ooh, that's fine, we'll soon see about that. - Why did you have to go and upset that poor girl? She was only... - I think... that you're a girl. You're not a man at all. (Slams chopsticks on table) - Huh? You apologize! - I said, you're a girl. What are you going to do about it, then, huh? (suspenseful music) - You. (man yells) (men fighting) (punches landing) - Too late. (man groaning) (punches landing) - Get out! Faster. (men groaning) - Thanks - Thank you, thank you. - Aw, that's all right. - Hai-Chuan, you hit Ching-chun Hai, you'll be in trouble. - Don't worry. I can handle him. - Ah. we all hate him, Ching-chun Hai crawls to the Japanese, he can do anything he wants to around here. (sighs) - All these damn traitors, they should be wiped out. - Ah hah, the best thing for you to do would be to hide for a while. - He's quite right. - Come with us. - Right. (serene music) - Miss Liao, the scarecrows, why do you keep looking at them all the time? Is there some special meaning? - Hm, Mr. Chuan, we've been wanting to meet you for a very long time. (men agreeing) It's quite a coincidence meeting you today like this. Thank you for your help. (laughs) - It's nothing. - We've heard so much about you. How good you are to others, and generous too. You're very respected in this part of China, now, you know. - Miss Liao, your words are very kind, but the scarecrows. - Let me put it this way. I live near the salt fields. That's where you got that illegal salt. - Huh? Just how do you know it's salt? - Be calm, I'm not going to report you. (laughs) Let's walk on. - Right. - Here, I'll do it. (man grunts) - I was trained and educated in the south. I'm back for a reason. I have a special mission. - Oh? - I might need you later on. - Anytime, you can always call on me. I'll do my best to help. - Oh, thank you. Actually, your cover will be quite enough. - I'll do my best. - There's two things we must do. We have to spy on the Japanese and let the staff know. Also, we must round up our people and prepare them. We're planning a really big attack. - Ah. - Scarecrows are used as a signal to make contact. - Great admiration for you and your father. - Father? He's not, you know. He's not related to me. - What? - We all work towards the same purpose. And as a matter of fact, Miss Liao here, is our superior. (laughs) - But you look rather old for this kind of thing. (laughs) - You would be surprised, you're probably older than I am. - Huh? (dramatic music) (both laugh) - Let's go. - Uh huh. (suspenseful music) - Keep going, don't panic. - Hey, where's your pass? - Hey. - Hey pretty girl, come over here. Hey, you're very cute. (laughs) Hey boys, let him go. - Sure. - Isn't it just a small world, then? Both of you together, ah? Now that you are here, you'll save me a lot of trouble. (laughs) - Charge! (men fighting) - You come here. (punches landing) (gunshots firing) (punches landing) (sniper crying) (fighting continues) (punches landing) (dramatic music) (slaps and punches land) (dramatic music) (man laughs) - What do you want? - To check the census. - There's only me here. There's no need to. (man laughs) - You look so pretty, and so lonely. So am I (laughs), let's get friendly. - You shut up. If you've come here to tell me something, say it fast and then get out. - You better be nice to me. Remember that the Jap's shot and killed your husband, huh? Hey, I can do quite a lot for you. In fact, I can stop them from locking you up in here. - Humph, you liar, expect me to believe you'd do something decent? - Hey, what have I ever done that makes you disbelieve? - I really can't stand you. That's all. - You can't compare with me. I am smart. Good-looking as well, intelligent, and I am the best fighter around here. - Oo, and you're the son of a double crosser. Your father's a traitor, pig. - (speaking mandarin) Be careful what you say, you will make me very mad. - Shut your mouth. - He will stop it. (laughs) Together we could have a good time. - Have a good time with your mother. - Leave my mother out of this. - You are a traitor. Well, you care about your mother. - Shut up, girl. - I'll say what I want. You hit me? I'll kill you. (slaps landing) - You'll be sorry. Wait till I finish with you? This will be one lesson you'll never forget. (clothing ripping) (slow motion gong) - Brother, you've come back. - Yeah. Blood brothers, Chou San-Ming, this is Miss Liao. - Oh, hi, Miss Liao - This here is Li Ping, her friend. This I her brother Lee, Chou San-Ming, here. - Hello, sir. (all laugh) (whispers) - Ah, hah. - Why don't we go inside, yeah, please. - Please. - Come on in here. Sit down, please, please. - Tell them to take special care of the parcels on the cart, and tell them in the kitchen that we want some food. - Oh, I'll do that now. - Thank you, you are much too kind. - No, we didn't need that much on the way. - We'll have a drink tonight, San-ming, - Yeah? - What's been happening out here? - The Japs have been strengthening their forces again. - Life's getting harder and harder, Wu Chang-yuen is causing more trouble. Yesterday, he hurt Shao Lung. - Shao lung? Is he hurt? - He's not badly hurt. He'll be all right. But he must rest. - Brother Wu has gone too far now. - Oh, he has. Pa Hei-chu hung herself yesterday. - Huh? What for? - Apparently Wu went to her house, about 12, last night, she was dead. So everyone's very suspicious of him now. - (sighs) Hei-chu couldn't stand him. He knew it, too. He's had his eye on her for ages. I thought something like this might happen. - What's the matter? - San-ming, you tell Miss. Liao about the situation here. I'll go in and prepare the rooms for you. And I'll go and see Shao Lung. - Are you sure it's no trouble? - Ah, no, no, not at all. - Dad? - Hm? - What's wrong? - What happened yesterday? - Nothing, dad. - Tell me, did you bully Hai-chu? - Hai? It's not my fault she hung herself. - Oh, but you were at her house. - Just for the census. She kept calling me a traitor, we had a quarrel, she tried to kill me. - Using what? - This gun, - Aw, where's this from? - Her husband was in the gorillas. - Oh. - Don't you think these conspirators should be killed? - We have to be very careful. Sit down. I must talk to you. - Oh. - A whole Jap troop was wiped out, high up in the western hills. A guard post at Sun Yuen was also attacked. I'm sure there must be expert fighters among the gorillas there. - People around here have been practicing martial arts. Dad, if they joined together, it could make things difficult for the Japanese and us. That could be dreadful. - We must think of some way. - Auntie. - Hi Chuan, I'm glad you're here. Sit down. - Thanks. Take this, it's for you. - It's a lot. You're much too kind to us. You don't need to do that. - It's not much. Shu-shen in? - Yes, Shu-shen, Hai- Chuan is here. - Ah! Hai-Chuan! - Shu-shen. Auntie, I want to take Shu-shen out. - Fine, fine. (romantic music playing) (birds twittering) (romantic music continues) - Hai-Chuan. - Brother Wu. - You're back, Hai-Chuan. - Ah, how are you? - I'm still very busy, serving the public, not easy. I'm running up my fee. - Brother, don't strain yourself. - Enough. Forget about that. Or we'll end up in a fight. - Okay. - Have you set a date for the wedding yet? - (laughs) Not yet, it'll be sometime after autumn. - Ah, don't forget to invite me to it, huh? - Of course I'll invite you. - Hmm, that's good, you two go along, I have to leave. - See you, then. - Heh. Oh, Hai-Chuan, I suppose old Laos told you about me and Shao Lung, huh? - He deserved a lesson. - Oh, you're not mad then? - (laughs) I'm not mad at all. - (laughs) - I feel that you're too kind to him. I'm sure he'd never do anything for you. - I know that. We both studied under the same teacher. He's older than me. - It's just that he seems to be against you. He thinks you're scared of him. - Let him think it. In fact I'm not scared, I'm patient. Let's go back. - Good. (tense upbeat music) - What do you want? - Nothing much. What are you going? - Why'd you ask? - Huh? (laughs) I'm with Chang-yuen, heard me? - Oh, you're the son of the village chief. - Heh, so you see, I can ask. - (laughs shyly) My father and I bowed with Chou Hai-Chuan. - Oh, Chou Hai-Chuan? - Yes. - Why don't you report to headquarters? - (laughs) Sorry. I don't know the rules. - All right for you. Chou Hai-Chuan should know. I think I'll charge you with harboring criminals. - Me, a criminal. - Huh? How should I know? Criminals don't go around advertising it, unless (laughs) you let me search you. - Keep away. - (chuckles) Well then, you search me, heh, heh, heh. - Bastard. If you come any closer, I'll hit you. - All right, let's see you have a go. - Let me teach you a lesson. - Oh? (laughs) You want to play games, huh? (grunts) Her pretty rose, her spiky thorns, too. This could be quite fun, watch out! (fighting) - Master, master. - Heh, get her! (fighting off men) - Good, take them off. - Listen, don't be so smart. Or I'll give you something to remember. - Good, I like some excitement. (laughs) (sounds of fighting commence) - Miss Liao! Miss Liao. Miss Liao, brother. I'll introduce you. This is Miss Liao, who is a guest in my house. This is my blood brother. - Hai-Chaun, although we are good friends, the rules must be observed. Please report her to the headquarters. - Hm, I'll do as you say. - Good, come. - Brother, are you badly hurt? - It's nothing. - Brother. - Hm. - Will he cause more trouble? - I don't think so. I'll be your guarantor. I'll introduce you. This here is Miss Liao. This is Shu-Shen. Let's get back to town. - Oh, you go on first. I'll follow later. - Sayonara, sayonara, sayonara. - Dad, what did Wu Chang want? - It's about the gorillas. He wants to have a census check. Huh? Look at your face. - Huh? Little girl called Liao did that to me. - Did she? Up your old tricks again. - The girl lives at Chou Hai-Chuan's place. She hasn't yet registered. - Huh, why did you start a fight with her? - She's quite attractive. - Huh. I'll bet you tried to grab at her. - I didn't, I... - You didn't? That's strange. I know about you and your old tricks. Okay, tell me what should we say to Mu Chang, eh? - Tell him to bring in some more troops to strengthen their hold around here. Also send out more spies to watch for gorillas. - Huh, you're very smart. I'll do as you say, you're a bright boy. - Also, I suspect Chou Hai-Chuan's gang. - Oh? But can you prove it? - Not yet, but I'm working on it. - Don't rush it. He's well-respected here. - I know that, but we'll get him before too long. - Hmm. (papers rustling) (suspenseful music) (man laughing) - What are you doing, huh? (punches landing) (both gasp in surprise) - Brother. - Huh? - When did you come? - Just now, you're alone here? - Yes. What's wrong? - Oh, nothing's wrong. Just the census. My job is not an easy one. Got a match? - Oh, on the table. Brother, mother's out now, please come back later. - Ah, scared to be alone with me. I won't bite you, love. - That's not the point. People might talk. - Oh, but you and Chou Hai-Chuan, meeting up in the hills then, that's all right. - Of course, it's all right. We're getting married. - Hah! You're lucky to have all this freedom, in other places, it wouldn't be allowed. - This is our business, it's not yours. - Oh, yes it is. It's my job to know what's going on. - Don't threaten me with your position. We haven't done anything wrong. - Hah, don't be so sure. Being seen with Chou Hai-Chuan is quite enough. Just be careful. - Hai-Chuan? Hai-Chuan's done nothing. - Hah! Just keep calm, nothing has happened as yet. - Hmm - Huh? What's this? Salt! A big bag of salt. Must be Chou Hai-Chuan's present. Yeah. He must have some more. Hm. - Brother. - Shu-shen, I won't stay now. (laughs) (dramatic music) - You better capture them! - Yes. - Kill them all. - Yes. - But if you fail to do it, - Yes. - then we will kill you. - Yeah, yes. (slaps landing) - So, why did you keep it? - For our food, why do you think? - Come on, you're using it to make gunpowder. - I don't understand. - Heh, don't you? I bet the gorillas understand though. - Brother, we grew up together. You know what I'm like, don't try and frame me. - Ah, forget about the past, I've got a job to do. - My father thought of you as his son. He treated you as he treated me. - Well, if that's true, how come you're the better fighter? - A proverb says 'hard practice makes a good fighter.' Brother, you remember what happened. You took to gambling and brothels at the age of 17. How could you be a good fighter? - Shut your mouth. You have no right to judge. You're in big trouble, now. I won't listen to you. - Brother. Listen to me. - I said, shut up, and I meant it! (slaps landing) - Oh. (Shu-shen crying) - (sighs) You want to know what I think? Yung-Sheng Wang and his no good son should be got rid of as soon as possible. We'll rescue Hai-Chuan and hide in the Hills. - Quiet for now. (Shu-shen crying) Now, Lao, take Shu-shen home first. Try to comfort her. We'll arrange things, we'll get Hai-Chuan out of prison. - Sure. (Shu-shen sobbing) - Shu-shen, don't worry. - Thank you. (somber music playing) Thank you. - I have an idea. If Hai-Chuan would start a big fight, we could rescue him on scene. - Wu Chang-yuen's always had suspicions, but he can't prove them. One thing worries me though. What will happen if he finds out we are planning an attack. - Hm, let's hope that doesn't occur. - But surely, illegal salts, no cause for jail. They've been much too hard. We need someone respected to go and ask for pardon. I'm sure the town chief would have to give him a hearing. - Hey, I know who'll do it, Chiang Chao - Chiang Chao, him? - He's Wu Chang's teacher and Hai-Chuan's friend. He's very well known here and respected. They'd have to listen to him. - Go and ask him. - Right. - Eh, come in. - Gentlemen. - Teacher. - Good to see ya. - I wouldn't waste your time, so I'll come straight to the point, as a favor to me, let Chou Hai-Chuan go. You have no right to hold him here. - He's right. - Wait a minute, please have a seat. We'll talk about it, eh? - I know Hai-Chuan is extremely honest. I'm sure he's quite innocent of all your charges. - Teacher, you must admit that it looks very bad, hiding salt like that. - There's nothing wrong with that. Maybe he wants to eat it. - But it's not that simple, teacher. The rules of the town should not be broken. - Right. I'll be his guarantor. (group agreeing) Something wrong? - Ah, he'll be surprised, I'll handle the whole matter. - Dad, you must be crazy. - Oh, enough, show some respect for once. Don't interrupt. That's enough. - Teacher. You don't realize what you're up against. The Japanese are very tough guys. - You can't frighten me, Ou. - Dad. - All right, release Hai-Chuan. - Good. Let's go then. - Hai-Chuan, Hai-Chuan. - Huh? Uncle. Mr. Chen. Mr. Lee, Uncle. Thank you. - Are you all right? - I'm all right now. - Chang-yuen, the handcuffs, take them off him now. - Dad... - You don't have to worry about that. (snaps handcuffs) (triumphant music) I could've done that before. So don't accuse Chou Hai-Chuan for being dishonest before you have proof. Look at it. Easy to break. These stupid things. - Listen carefully and pay attention. Today's lesson will be one of the most important moves in boxing. It's called the aided joining steps and it must be practiced every day. Shao Lung, you show them. - Sure. Huh! - The second step, stretch your leg and kick out, the third, the fourth, the fifth, the sixth, the seventh, the eighth. Repeat. The first, the second, the third, the fourth, the fifth, the sixth, the seventh. (Miss Liao claps) Hello Miss Liao. - Hello - Good morning. - Hello. - Nice to see you. - Thanks. - We're learning the eighth step move. - That's a good move. (laughs) But I'm sure you know much more about the move than what I do. - Nonsense, in Grand Ka, I saw how excellent you where then. - Please, Miss, will you teach us something? - What? I'm no good. - You are, please teach us. - You see, you better show them some steps. - Miss Liao, Miss Liao. - Ha, all right, but you'd better finish the eight adjoining steps first, then I'll show you a flash jump. - All right, that's a promise. - All right. - Stay where you are. (foreboding music) - Brother, what's the matter? - Don't get alarmed, we've got to arrest all new strangers. - Miss Liao has already been to register. - I know she has, but I think you're hiding something else. Ha. Oh Miss Liao, when do you think you'll be leaving? - When I'm called to the front. - Hey, you must be careful. because this wars no place for pretty girls like you. - Thanks for the warning. (laughs) - Search! (foreboding music) - Get in there. - Help him, help him, I beg you to help. - I can't help him now. He's a conspirator. - Please, sir, please, sir. I beg you. (laughs) - Come on baby. (dramatic music) (gunshot) (man falls) (man laughs) - Thank you. (man laughing louder) - Heh, hi, hi. What's that, then? (both laugh) - Oh goodness. You were quick. (gunshot) (groaning) - Why not just speak in Chinese? It's easier. - Sure. sure. - All right. Tell me your plan then. - Sure, as you notice that people hate you, there would be a revolt against your army at any time. So then we worked out quite a good plan. That features a tournament. - Hmm Hmm. - Huh? That's true. Huh? - Our biggest worry is if the good fighters join in with the conspirators. So we have to get rid of them. - Maybe you're right. What do we do? - (whispers) - [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen. The Japanese want to establish friendship with us. After all, they're very much the same as we are, except for a few economic, political, and military differences. So we've organized a martial arts tournament. Their best warriors against ours. I'm sure both sides could learn something new from this. The competition will be on every day, and I hope there's a good attendance. Let me introduce three famous Samurais to you. The first is Tang Kai-tak. (applause) The second is this gentleman. This is Ching-chun Kao-nan. A Judo expert. (applause) The second is Kyoki Shoza. He's a Sumo expert. (applause) The third is Karate expert, Ting Mu. (foreboding music) Give him a big hand! (applause) Now seeing that they've come such a long way, we'll let them have a rest first. But I feel like some practice. Anyone like to have a go with me? - Let me try! (applause) - I just need a little practice, sir. - Fine. - Hah! Hah. (slaps and punches landing) (man falls) (laughs) - You defeated me, sir. - Ah! (punch lands) - Ah! - You're a dirty fighter! And you're a traitor! - Your funeral is waiting for you. Go and get ready for it. (laughs) - Come join our friendly fight. - You're a liar! If it's all fun, why did you hurt him, then? (crowd agrees) - It sometimes happens in all the very best fights. And now, it's Ching-chun Kao-nan's turn. (lone clapping) - Dammit. My name's Ho Chi, I come to fight. - Here's a new competitor, his name's Ho Chi. (applause) (laughs) (fighting noises) (blows landing) (crowd gasping) - Brother. Brother. - Yah! (blow hits and man falls) (sparse applause) (Sumo laughing) (punches landing) (man yelling) (suspenseful music) (both men yelling) (head smashing through stage) (Sumo yelling) (spine cracking) (falling down stairs) (crowd objecting) (fighting noises) (blows landing) - On the first day two men were killed, two badly wounded. - The Japanese pretend they're being friendly to us, in actual fact, they're out to kill us. - It's just a plot. They want to kill all of our fighters. So we can't defend ourselves. - You are right. - So, then, we'd better keep away from it, because it's not worth it. If I just die on the stage, if our fighters kill the Japanese, they're sure to be executed. Use your influence to keep them away from the fight. - That will not be easy. They are all very hot tempered, especially in a challenge. - But still, I want you to do what you can. - I'll try to, perhaps local fighters will listen to me. But those from afar can't be influenced by me. (ceremonious music) (men fighting) (laughing) - Brother, my turn. - Hush, let me go first. - Brother, someone's up there. (fighting noises) (blows landing) (crowd yelling) (laughing) - We've always been known as the weaklings of the east. That's because physically we're not strong, and we're smaller. That's why we should work much harder. Build up our strength to show them all that we're just as strong and healthy as they are the Hall of Good Patients. We have named our school. And that should be a reminder of why you're here. You're here to learn the martial arts, improve your physique, make us proud of you, and you're here to learn to fight only for sport. So then, I want you all to stay away from the Japanese competition. - Master, Chang Kai-tak's arrived. - Oh, Mr. Chang - Mr. Chang. - Mr. Chang, have a seat. - Chou, I must speak with you at once. - Sure. You can have a break now. - Thank you, sir. - Thank you. - Uncle. - Let's sit down. - Sure. What can I do for you? - (sighs) I'm very worried about the tournament. Since you asked me not to take part, I haven't even been to watch, but it makes me mad to see what's happening. Since it started, 60 of our best men are dead or wounded. - I wish I could've warned everyone about it, dammit. - And now all the fighters are asking me to take part. What can I do? I can't just stand back. - Uncle, can't you see this is a trick? - I know that. But if it doesn't work this time, the Japs will find something else. Something probably worse. If only I could get rid of the three of them, at least we would all get some revenge. - Uncle, I hope you'll think this over. - No, I've made up my mind, and once I've decided, I stick to my plan. I come today to ask you to be at the fight tomorrow. - I'm sorry, uncle, I won't be there then, I'm leaving town. - Oh. Then ask San-ming and Miss Liao to come. (pensive music) - All right. (laughs) - Mr. Chang, sit over here, heh, heh. (cups being placed on table) - Mr. Chang, something to eat? - Jasmine tea, please. - Right, right away. - Mr. Chang. I still hope you'll change your mind. - No, I've made my decision. (laugh) (whispering) (suspenseful music) - Uncle, let me have a try. - All right. (applause) - Fatso, come here. - I am here. (Kyoki laughing raucously) How are you! (fighting noises) (blows landing) (laughs) - Ah! Ah! Ah! (blows landing) (applause) (cheering) - Miss Liao, you should've killed him. - No, if I had, I wouldn't be alive now. Uncle Chang, you'd better not go up there. - No, I'm going to finish off those devils. If I die up there, it will prove one thing, we Chinese are no cowards. - Uncle. - Teacher. - Teacher. - I'm not your teacher! From this minute, you're no longer my student. - Which one wants to fight first? (applause) - Yeah. - Yeah. (suspenseful music) (men grunting) (blows landing) - Ah! (men grunting) (bones cracking) (applause and cheering) (man yelling) (fighting noises) (blows landing) (dramatic music) (blows landing) - Oh, oh. (gasping) (militarized music) - Uncle. - So long, so long. - General, what did he say? - He wants his brother, Te-nan Lai to kill them all. - Oh, is his brother a very good fighter? - He's our number one fighter, judo, Kendo, Karate. He's an expert. - Oh. - I was proud of my own skills, but I didn't realize that the Japs were so skillful, especially the karate. It's just like our Chinese job, isn't it? - Uncle, you're quite right. The Jap fighters learn from our martial arts, but they adapt them to suit themselves. They have simplified them. (uncle groans) I feel that our old established teaching methods should be revised. - Miss Liao, San-ming, you too, tell Hai-chuan, it's up to you now to revise it. Help the Chinese. (groans) - Uncle. - Uncle. - Uncle. - I think we'd better go back south to see Captain Wang. (claps) - Dad, in the last fight, Chang kai-tak was killed. Two Japs were killed, and one wounded. Good thing Hai-chuan hasn't come. - Huh? Chang (unintelligible) hasn't he? - I know that, but that guy doesn't care about fights, not interested. Only drinks, we're wasting our time. - Huh? But he's supposed to be Japan's number one, don't you worry. (suspenseful music) - Good morning, Mr. Chin. (tray sets down) (laughs) Please, sir. (blade whips around) (laughs) - I'm afraid Chou Hai-chuan won't turn up. - We'd better flush him out, Dad. I have an idea, we'll kill two birds at once. - Oh, what is it? (fighting noises) (blows landing) (men crashing through doors) (blows landing) (men grunting) (menacing music) - Shen. (Shu-shen gasps) - Shen. (menacing music) (man laughs) - San-ming. (men grunting) (fighting noises) - Kill that little bastard. (blows landing) (men grunting) (sword whisking) - Make sure to run away quickly. Go on! (men grunting and yelling) (blows landing) (men grunting) (dramatic music) (somber dramatic music) - Shu-shen. Mrs. Li. This must be Wu Chang-yuen's terrible work. - I will go and fight him. - Shau Lung, Shau Lung, Shau Lung! Shau Lung! (tense dramatic music) - Wu Chang-yuen. Wu Chang-yuen. - Heh, little bastard. How dare you call out my name like that. - I'm going to kill you! (crowd cheers) (boy grunting) - General Chang ask Chian Chao to kill him. - Kill the kid? - It will bring out Chou Hai-chuan. (dramatic music) - Hey, Chian, kill him. (fighting noises) - Master, master, master, master! Master, terrible news. - Tell me what's wrong. Our boxing school was destroyed by the Japs. Also, poor Shu-shen... - Shu-shen's not hurt? - Shu-shen and her mother were both killed and Shao Lung... - Shao Lung? - He's in the fight. - The fight. (fighting noises) (dramatic music) (Shao Lung crying out) (sad dramatic music) - Shao Lung, Shao Lung, Shao Lung. (Shao Lung grunts) (sinister dramatic music) (laughs) - Miss Liao, terrible, it's bad news. - Huh? - Masters gone to the fight. (fighting noises) (blows landing) (men grunting) (blows landing) (men grunting) (blows landing) - Ah! (dramatic music) (sword unsheathing) (sword swishing) (men grunting) (sword hitting daggers) (suspenseful music) (fighting noises) (man laughing) (man grunting) (gunshots) (crowd screaming) - Fire! (crowd yelling) (fighting noises) - Let's go, let's go. - Hai-chuan. - Huh? You found it, then. - We'll do whatever you say. - Good. Let's go. (men grunting) (fighting noises) (swords swishing) (fighting noises) (men yelling) (blows landing) (men grunting) - Kill her! - Come on! (men yelling) (men grunting) (blows landing) (fighters grunting) (dramatic music) - Brother, I... I... - I've never seen anything so disgusting as you two. - Master, he... - I was wrong. (crying) (blows landing) - Hah! - Let's go now. - Okay. (Triumphant music)
