It's overwhelming. It's humbling. It's totally cool. It's really neat. You were just sharing with me earlier about your trip to the holy land, and that you were in the garden. I'd just come out of the garden tomb, which is just an amazing moment anyway, and then to step out and people start screaming, Dennis get up here! And I run up, there are hundreds of people, little groups worshipping around the garden. And there's a group of Spanish people singing one of my songs, "we will worship the lamb of glory" -- singing it in Spanish. Then a group from New York start singing it in English and I'm bawling. I'm just losing it. When I think about that and I know you're living it, god has done so much in your life. To come to that point, to have gotten through everything and to come to that point where god always had this plan, always had this gift to give you, and then you're seeing it used throughout the world. It's got to be just hard to even-- yeah. I don't know if your viewers -- most of them would know, but I struggled with homosexuality for such a long time in my life. In fact, November 7, 1981 during a time of worship, the lord met me in a profound way and said, Dennis, I love you no matter what. ♪ We will worship the lamb of glory ♪ ♪ we will worship the king of kings ♪ ♪ we will worship the lamb of glory ♪ ♪ we will worship the king ♪ we will worship the lamb of glory ♪ ♪ we will worship the king of kings and we will worship ♪ ♪ we will worship the lamb of glory ♪ ♪ we will worship the king ♪ and with our hands lifted high, ♪ ♪ we will worship and sing ♪ and with our hands lifted high, ♪ ♪ we come before you rejoicing ♪ with our hands lifted high to the sky ♪ ♪ as the world wonders why, ♪ we'll just tell them we're loving our king ♪ ♪ and with our hands lifted high, ♪ we will worship and sing ♪ and with our hands lifted high, ♪ ♪ we come before you rejoicing ♪ with our hands lifted high to the sky ♪ ♪ as the world wonders why, we'll just tell them ♪ ♪ we're loving our king ♪ whoah, we'll just tell them we're loving our king ♪ ♪ whoah, we'll just tell them we're loving our king ♪ ♪ whoah, we'll just tell them we're loving our king ♪ I think the core issue for every human being that has ever existed and ever will, is identity. It really does boil down to where do we gain our identity from? You have all kinds of addictions. You have kinds of different behaviors that I think all develop from that central core issue: Who am I and why am I here? How are you? Hey Dennis. Yes. Hi. Hi. It's wonderful that you're here. I'm glad to be here. I was at two of the recordings in waco. Are you kidding me? Years ago. A long time ago. A long time ago. Do you want to hear more of your music through your-- yeah. I think I do.

I don't want any other voices influencing me. I just really am doing my best to try to hear what the lord wants me to do. I simply ask two questions: Lord, would you give me a sense of what the needs of this group are going to be tonight? Second question: Lord would you let me feel what you feel towards them? So I find it's easier to ask those questions and really hear when I'm by myself. Go ahead, ladies. Thank you. I recognize your picture. Uh-oh. I went somewhere last week, couple weeks ago, and this lady comes up to me at the table and says, your hair's a lot grayer and you're a lot heavier than I thought you'd be. And what are you supposed to say? Thank you? Great pleasure to introduce Dennis jernigan. Most of you probably know of him, if you don't know him already. And his heart, I think, is a very similar type of message so let's welcome Dennis. Everybody doing okay? Yes. Me too. I love the line from chariots of fire. Someone asked Eric liddell, why do I run. He said, "when I run, I feel god's pleasure." When I worship, I'm like Bruce. I feel my god's pleasure. I used to think god hated me. God takes more delight in my presence than I take in his. That is the absolute truth. Whether you feel a thing or not, brothers and sisters, our god is here. Would you mind just for the next few minutes standing in his honor? Let's worship our god. I was born in a little town in northeast Oklahoma called sapulpa, Oklahoma on February 9, 1959. I grew up in the church. My dad was the song leader and my mom taught sunday school. In fact, this very church I'm sitting in, this building, my grandfather, my mom's dad, had pastored when she was in high school. Wow. It looks so much smaller than I remember. I'm sure somewhere on the back of these pews -- oh, yeah. Right here...Me and my brothers and cousins would get so bored during church, we would carve our initials and all kinds of stuff in here. Oh my goodness. D.j. Plus l.M. Yeah, lorrie Myers. I have no doubt that's what that means. She eventually married my cousin, but she dated my brother. She dated my cousin and she and I actually went out on a date before. I always said it was like we lived in a sheltered part of the world, because at that time, nothing bad ever happened in boynton. We just felt like we could turn our kids loose and they would be safe. It was a small town. Everybody knew everybody and everybody looked out for the others' kids, but then we lived on the farm three miles north of town, so our kids mostly played with their cousins and played here on the farm; fished, swam, rode their horses, such as that. My mom worked at the stockyards in okmulgee, Oklahoma, which is not very far from here. So every Saturday, we were at the stockyards helping. After playing with my brothers and cousins one afternoon, I decide I've got to go to the bathroom. So I'm like five years old. I go into this public restroom and do my business and I turn around and there's a guy there with his pants down, asking me to touch him. I had never seen anything like that in my life, so I ran. I did the right thing in the moment. I ran. I wouldn't let the guy touch me. It scared me to death, but I stopped short of telling my parents. People ask me, well, why didn't you tell anyone? Well, when you're five years old, all kinds of thoughts are going through your head. My first thought was, why did that guy do that? Why did he want me to touch him like that? What about me makes him think he can do that? From my earliest memories, I just thought, wow, something is different about me. I just began to think of myself as something less than a little boy. I said, I'm not like the other boys. They let me know so. I can look at the evidence in my own life and realize I'm different than other little boys. I like to draw. I didn't know any other guys that liked to draw. I liked to dance and listen to music with my girl cousins. They were into certain things that were touchy feely and I was all over that. I was thinking that's cool, but the other guys said, no, that's what girls do. You're a sissy. I was such an emotional kid. Maybe that's what the guys identified as a effeminate, because I was very -- like if you cried, I would probably cry. I would get real emotional with you. If you were happy, I would get happy with you. If you get angry, I would get angry with you. That's just the way I'm wired. In one way, he was really shy and in another way, he was -- I don't want to call him aggressive, but he was. Around adults he was very shy, but around the other kids when they were playing and stuff, if they were playing a game or anything, he always wanted to win and be first, and he usually was. He was a good kid. I was really after my dad's affirmation. I really wanted his affection. I really wanted his attention. I really wanted him to be proud of me. He didn't really talk to me conversationally. He didn't ever tell me he loved me, and so talk about feeling like I have to perform for my dad's affection. I really did. That's the way I lived my life. In other words, if I performed well, people would like me. If I performed well, people will affirm me. I equated my performance with how much somebody could love me. I discovered real quickly, if I did well on the baseball field -- because my dad coached my little league team. The first time I got a hit, my dad went nuts, and I thought, wow. So it was being reinforced that if I perform well, you're going to like me. From the time I can remember, I just thought this piano was so cool. It's the piano I played as a kid. It's the piano that my aunt played. We'd have a choir practice. I started hearing an echo and it would be just half a bar behind what we were singing upstairs, but we'd hear the piano and it would be coming up from underneath out of the basement. And it made no difference what we were on, he sang or played right along, just note for note. He was about eight years old at the time. One sunday morning, here at this church out on the steps, I was playing with my brothers and cousins, I think I was about ten years old, and the men were standing there, talking. These are the men that I had grown up with respecting the most, the men who taught me about god from the time I can remember. And I'll never forget that sunday morning, they were talking about what they thought of homosexuals. I'd never even been able to put a name to what I'd struggled with until that sunday. It was terrible the way they talked about guys like me. I knew they were talking about me. They didn't know they were talking about me, so talk about feeling hopeless. These are the men that are like god. So that day I remember thinking, if they think that about me, that must be what god thinks about me. In fact, sermons I heard preached right here on that podium: Homosexuals are going straight to hell. That's what I thought as a kid, so I remember feeling hopeless. I remember having encounters with a couple of boys. Let's experiment. Let's touch each other, to the point where I looked forward to those times, because it meant I was going to get attention. I was going to -- at least the boys seemed to like that, when I touched them, especially the older boys. I remember them saying such good things to me. That's good. Good boy. Those were my first experiences with things sexual. You wouldn't think in a small town that kind of thing would happen, especially where all the guys are considered just really he-men and really macho. I didn't see myself that way at all. What I knew is that the other guys liked it and I liked the way it made them feel, because of the way it made me feel. I lacked the attention. I lacked the affirmation. That sounds sick. That's really how it began for me. My bed was in that corner. Another brother's bed was in this corner, a brother's bed in this corner, a brother's bed in this corner, and because, by the time I got into high school, I wanted privacy-- I don't know if you can still see it. Let's see if you can, but I'd tack up blankets to give me some sense of privacy. When I began having an awareness of what my struggles were, I was just rattled with shame and I thought the last person that can find out about me is my dad. So, my goodness, I kept my dad at arm's length for a huge part of my life, because I thought if he gets too close to me, he'll find out what I'm really like. He will disown me. He'll reject me and I wouldn't blame him. That's how I thought. ♪ When the night is falling and the day is done, ♪ ♪ I can hear you calling, come ♪ ♪ and I will come while you sing over me ♪ ♪ when the night would hide my way, ♪ ♪ I will listen until I hear you say, ♪ ♪ how I love you child ♪ I love you ♪ how I love you child ♪ I love you ♪ how I love you I want us to sing this again and I want us to think about something as we do. Psalm 32:7 says that he is our hiding place. It goes on to say that he will surround us with songs of deliverance. We need to hear a song of deliverance. The enemy is lying all the time. I asked the lord to sing to me songs of deliverance that declared the truth over my life, whose I am, who I am. My past does not define me. Failure does not define me. Circumstances do not define. Only one defines me and that's my maker. Let's worship him. Mauricio? Hi. Can you hear me fine? Yes, I can hear you fine. Can you hear me? I can hear you at very low volume. Okay, I can hear you. Okay. Tell me how you came to know my ministry. I sought for help here in my home town, in cordoba, and there was no help for my sexual brokenness, my homosexuality, sexual addiction. I went to speak with this lady in Buenos Aires. She was an American missionary. I confessed for the first time in my life all the sin, all the sorrow, all the pain. She said, you know what? A month ago I was in the states and I got the "break my heart oh god" cassette tape and some other of your tapes and cds. It was so revelatory for me to hear for the first time that somebody had left that life style behind and had sought and found healing, restoration and not just read about the hope, but also be ministered to my heart by your music, how god truly touched me so deeply and how he poured his love to me, to my heart, to my needy and hungry soul. It was so powerful, the true encounter I had with god, how he so powerfully met me right where I was. I gave my life to god. I really turned my life over to him and said, lord, you have to make sense of what's going on here. I said, you have created the andes mountains and you've created to the Atlantic ocean. You can do whatever you want. This is a small thing for you to do. That was the main thing. This was back in first week of 1996. Oh, my goodness. A long time ago. A long time ago. So tell me what you're doing now. How has that affected your life? When god has started healing me and restoring me, I starting sharing this with other folks in my church, here in cordoba, the freedom I was finding in Jesus. As god was healing me, I found a wonderful woman, Daniella, in 2002. And then we started getting to know each other and dating. In 2003, we got married. She continued this journey with me. You've been such a hero for me in the sense of how you persevere and how much you have believed god, and that has continually been a source of hope. I'm so proud of you. Can I just say I'm so proud of you? You're just giving me encouragement to keep doing what god's called me to do, brother. Would you meet my wife? Yes. Is she there? And my son? Let me go get them. Come here. Say hello to Dennis. He's a friend of mine from the United States. I speak English to him hi, Jonathan. How are you? You want to say, hi, Dennis? He's not shy. This is Daniella, my wife. Hi, Daniella. Good to meet you. Do you want to say something to my friend? You're in Oklahoma right? Yes, Oklahoma. All right. So, I want you to see this as one of god's trophies, my family, and how god has really used your ministry and the music that he has given you to bring life and hope to many people. Take this as a gift from the lord that he has done. Daddy? Yes? Can you show him my trophy? You want to show him your trophy? Ok. Words can not express the gratitude that is in my heart. To god first, and to god for your life and your ministry. Thank you. You've made my day. You have. I love you, brother. One Saturday morning, I was helping my mom bring in the groceries. It was raining and I was carrying in a six pack of cokes or something, and I slipped on the concrete. The bottles fell and broke and I fell and cut my hand. I still have the scar, about an inch scar, where I remember the doctor saying if it hadn't been right where it was, I probably wouldn't ever have been able to play the piano. I just never will forget that, just thinking, wow, and my grandmother telling me, "see god's protecting you for a reason." God has set you aside for a purpose. My grandmother, who was going to be moving to our farm, and my dad, I remember bought her a trailer house and guess what grandma had? She had a piano. So every day, I would go to grandma's house and it was just a really special place for me, because you know how grandmas are. They just make you feel like the most important person on earth at any given moment. That's how my grandma made me feel. She's the one that got him started actually on the music. She wasn't what you'd call a great pianist, but she taught him and showed him some chords and turned him loose. Where that little shed is right there is where my grandmother lived and she died when I was 13, but some of my favorite memories were of that home. When I was a kid struggling with same-sex attraction, I was a pretty confused guy. I remember being in high school and the guys just. There was these three guys that just seemed to live to make my life miserable, to remind me of how worthless of a human being I was, to remind me how much of a fag I was. So I could get through school, get home, get my chores done, and go to grandma's house and just play the piano. All the way through high school, I struggled with my sexuality. I didn't know how to deal with it. Just constantly prayed that the lord would fix me and that's how I would put it to myself: Lord, please just fix me. I don't feel right. I don't feel like the other boys. I don't even get attracted to girls, and on top of that, I really wanted to be attracted to girls. So there were a couple of girls that I dated in high school, never was physically aroused by them whatsoever, but I would go out on dates with them. I remember the first kiss I got. I just remember it going all over school and how proud I was to hear people say, Dennis got a kiss last night, and how big of a deal that was to me, because that, in my mind, meant that they would think that I was normal. I was constantly seeking the lord's forgiveness like a ping-pong ball. I would fail, try to do better, fail again. So I was constantly rededicating my life to the lord. I was always the first one at the altar, always the first one repenting. Nobody could figure out why I'm always there. They just thought again, that's the good jernigan boy. He's trying to be so good, but I was playing the game. I thought everybody was playing the game, because some of the guys that I was having sexual relationships with, were in church, so I didn't know anything else. I just thought that was my life. That was how I was relegated to live my life. In high school, I hoped for rescue. I hoped someone would rescue me and no one ever did. God used these guys to paint a picture of what rescue looks like for me. I'll give you a few seconds to find me. No, I'm there, just wait for it. Just wait for it. Isn't that awesome? I played basketball with these same guys from third grade on. I played in three state tournaments here in Oklahoma. I was the starting point-guard for all four years of high school. I was the one, if we had a box one defense, you had one good player, I was assigned to foul you out, and I was an awesome faker. A couple of occasions, I would frustrate that good player so badly, they'd bump me. I would just step back, fold my arms and go, go ahead, you're about to make the biggest mistake of your life. I didn't even have to look. These guys surrounded me every time, because these were my friends. I also wore another name in those days. I hate the name. It's the 'n' word lover. I thought, yeah, they're my friends. I do love them. So much of my time was spent alone and I didn't think anything about it. I just felt like nobody's going to bother me today. Nobody's going to mess with me today. After school and I got my chores done, I'd spend hours, always two to three hours a day, at the piano. I got to stay up late a lot of times because "oh, Dennis is practicing the piano. Let's not bother him." I loved the practice, but what I loved as much as that, if not more, was the fact that nobody would hurt me. It was a refuge for me. ♪ You are my strength when I am weak ♪ ♪ you are the treasure that I seek ♪ ♪ you are my all in all ♪ seeking you as a precious Jewel ♪ ♪ lord, to give up I'd be a fool ♪ ♪ you are my all in all for the song, "you are my all in all" that was like 1989. People all over the world know that song, and it was from a little inner-city church where that song was born. I'd just instructed the people after a time of worship, "now let's pray that the lord would bring us provision in our lives this day." All of the sudden, I began to hear this melody and because of what I was going through in my own personal life, "lord, the enemy wants me to give up. "He's always wanting me to give up. That would be the most foolish thing I could think of." So I began to put those thoughts to the melody I was hearing. And that morning during the time of prayer, I wrote down the whole thing while people were praying. They didn't even know what I was doing. I wrote the whole song. The next morning, I taught the song and we haven't stopped singing it since. ♪ Worthy is your name. Wow. It still sounds the same.

We built a stage down there below the hill. People came and parked on the other side of the pasture and 4,000 people showed up and just sat on the hillside. It was the coolest thing ever. The man who built the house actually had a vision for doing some of the things that we were going to do, so he was very sad to leave the place, but I told him my vision was to create a place where people would feel safe and have a place to come to if they needed hope or they needed friendship or they needed whatever. And through the years, that's what it's become. In fact, we consider our house a hospital. ♪ Hallelujah he reigns in majesty. ♪ ♪ Hallelujah. I began, what I consider, really the true heart of my ministry, home ministry, as early as 1985 or 1986. We were here in Oklahoma city and our church had begun developing home groups and I became a leader of one of those groups. When my story came out in 1988, oh my goodness, I began to be flooded with people who wanted to talk to me and wanted to meet with me. So we just began to meet in our home. ♪ Hallelujah. ♪ He reigns in righteousness. ♪ ♪ Oh hallelujah. You get to know somebody on their own turf and you begin to feel safe. And we found, we accomplished more ministry, it seems, in our living room, than we ever do in the public gatherings. I'll never stop doing both, as long as the lord allows me. But really getting down to where the rubber meets the road, it's in my living room because people let their guard down and feel like this is a safe place. I can be honest. ♪ Hallelujah. ♪ You reign in righteousness. ♪ Oh hallelujah. Father, thank you for your presence. Thank you for just one more opportunity to worship you together with my friends. We need you. My perception of what the church should be: Shouldn't we be the first place people who hurt, people who are struggling with anything, regardless of what it is -- you fill in the blank with whatever, it shouldn't matter-- shouldn't we be the first place a hurting person should be able to turn and find safety, a safe place to share? I think that's why I get so flooded with people telling me their stories, because they hear me tell my story and they figure, jernigan can be honest about his stuff. He's a safe place. Well, I think that's the body of Christ. That's the way we should be. I believe Jesus would be right where people are saying, you're hurt? Come here. Let's talk. You need help. You need someone to talk to. I can at least listen. To me, that's pretty much my ministry. I just listen to people. Most people are good at figuring out their own problems, figuring out their own way out, because you just present the love of Jesus to them. Jesus is really much better at being a savior than I am. I contacted him through Facebook and since we weren't face to face, it was easier to be really honest and since he didn't know me. I just was like blah. This is what I'm struggling with. I didn't think he'd answer. I saw some of the songs that he's written and I was like, we sing these in church. He doesn't have time for me. He's probably really busy, but within a day, he had written me back and he's like, just encouraged me and told me that it was possible to be set free. You don't have to live that way. We just started exchanging letters over Facebook. I've only ever heard condemnation from the pulpit -- people being like, homosexuality is an abomination, but not saying that you can be set free. God doesn't wait for us to get all our stuff in order before we come to him. He's like, come to me with all that baggage and I'll help you. When you really encounter god's love, he actually helps you. Let those things go. Rather than, "I've got to get my life straight. I got to become straight to come to Jesus." He's like, "no, I'll help you with that. Let's do it hand in hand." He's not waiting for you to be perfect. ♪ Some call me a fool for daring to say I'm changed. ♪ ♪ If that makes me a fool, ♪ I wouldn't trade what I've found for anything. ♪ ♪ I am changed. I wrote my first song probably when I was just a kid, like 9 or 10 years old. I didn't know how to write it down. I say write in the sense that I made it up. I wanted to major in composition when I got to college and the problem was, I didn't read music. So I went to the head of the theory and composition department and said, I want to write music. I believe I can write music. I want to major in theory and composition and the head of the department looked at me and said, "we only have a few openings "and we reserve them for people we see potential in. We don't see any potential in you." I remember when I got here to obu, it was like a whole new world for me. I was scared to death. I was the first in our family to go to college, so nobody knew what to tell me anyway. I just remember feeling overwhelmed and afraid. My freshman year in 1977, I remember my first contemporary Christian artist that I experienced was a guy named Keith green. I came here to raley chapel and I remember getting there early. He sits down at the piano. He didn't have a band with him or anything, just him and the piano and he began to sing these incredible songs, not just about god, but songs of intimacy right to god. ♪ I find it hard to believe ♪ someone like you cared for me ♪ ♪ you put this love in my heart. ♪ His music became just an integral part of my life. I would try to play his songs. I would try to sing like he did. I would try to be like him. In that same year, somebody introduced me to the music of a Christian rock band, called second chapter of acts. The lead singer, Annie herring, went to Southern California to make it in the music business, was signed by CBS records, arming her to be like the next Janice joplin and became involved in the drug scene, gave birth to two children, gave them both up for adoption. She met this producer named buck herring and they were born again. ♪ Took away my sin and shame. ♪ One song in particular on this album, I'll never forget it. It just simply says, "he took away my sin and shame. "He took away my sin and shame. "He loves me. "He loves me. Hallelujah." ♪ He loves me. ♪ He loves me. ♪ Hallelujah. My perspective was, I was worthless. My perspective from the time I was a little boy was, my particular sin god hates more than others. That's just what the church had communicated to me. That's what I had come to believe about myself. I was unlovable. I was not worthy. I was not ever capable of getting close to god, yet I kept striving for that. I kept longing for that, kept hearing the message, god loves me, but I just didn't see how. So when I would hear that song, I would just get so frustrated. Yet, it kept me coming back over and over again. For the four years of my college career, the music of Keith green and especially Annie herring literally kept me from taking my life on more than one occasion. Each one of these rooms has a piano inside, and on a lot of occasions it was difficult to even find a room. There were so many music majors during my particular time here, so that meant I was here at all hours of the night, never knowing which piano you were going to get. Some of them were crappy. Some were awesome, but it didn't really matter actually. Just a piano was all I needed. This is where bison glee club, the choir I was in, gathered every day during the week, for rehearsal. This was one of the few times I was really happy when I was on campus, was in this room. I notice over here there's pictures from my era and I even see my little pretty face right here. That would be, oh my goodness, 1978 or 1979. I'm still close to -- here's my friend, Chuck king. I recall walking down the hallway looking in the little glass doors, trying to find an open room, and there was Dennis jernigan. He was playing music that obviously wasn't the Italian art songs and that kind of thing that we were supposed to be learning at the time. So I stood outside the door for a little bit and listened to what was going on in there. I was just so impressed by it. It was very different and he was -- I could see him through the glass. He was really into what he was doing. He was obviously in his own world and I'd knock on the door and "come in." "Hey, how are you doing?" He stood with me when, just a lot of people fell by the wayside. He stood with me all these years. Just a faithful friend. Dennis and I first met in college. I was a sophomore transfer student at Oklahoma baptist university and I sat on the front row of music theory class and he was a back row kind of guy. I remember Melinda walking into the classroom and thinking, wow, what a beautiful girl. If ever I could be married, I'd like to marry someone like that. I just thought it'll never happen, because I can't even -- I'm not aroused. He didn't come off that way. He was hiding and that's why I didn't know. He wasn't overt about it. Very covert. Trying to live the good Christian college student persona. I better date somebody. But he actually cared about me and I really cared about him. He was just really confused. It's like the old vaudeville acts where they'd have these little dowels and plates spinning and you have to keep them all spinning, like 20 plates at once. Well, something's got to give. You can't just run around all the time, because you're going to eventually run out of steam. That's how I felt. I felt like I'm running myself ragged, just trying to play the game. Keeping everybody at bay with my performance and it was like constantly feeling like I'm going to be found out. While I was dating Melinda, I would still have sexual encounters with other guys and it seems like every time I did, I would just go break up with Melinda. She didn't know what was going on with me and there was no way I was going to tell her. I kept trying to suppress it and kept failing. It seemed everywhere I turned, there was a guy struggling just like me. We would find each other and just fall. So I really struggled with shame big time. In 1980, fall comes along. I'm desperate. I feel like a worthless human being worm of a guy. I walk across campus at obu one day and I hear somebody call my name. I turn around and it's a Christian leader in the community. A husband, father, well-respected, well-known man in the community. How do you know who I am? You know what he began to do? Invest his life in mine. Invest his life in mine. He would take me out for a coke and pray with me. How are your studies doing? How can I help? Week after week, did this. So you know what? I came to a point one night where I was so desperate. I went to him and said, I got something that's crushing me on the inside and if I don't tell someone, I think I'm going to die. But I'm scared to death to tell you. Are you going to love me no matter what? He said, I've heard it all before. You can trust me. So I told him. I felt like the weight of the world lifted off my shoulders. It lasted a few moments, because he then made a sexual advance on me. It happened. I felt so humiliated. I felt so betrayed. I just remember just giving up. I felt just -- I didn't know. I thought, what? This is -- you're supposed to help me. I was disgusted. Not just disgusted with him, disgusted with myself. I was so ashamed. I went back to my little apartment. I had a little gas heating stove. I thought, okay I know what to do now. I'll turn on the stove. I won't light the flame. This is going to end now. I'll put an end to this. I can't do this anymore. I can't take the pressure anymore. I can't live like this anymore. I can't do this to my family. I went through the whole list of people that if anyone found out what I was struggling with, what it would mean to their life. In a sense, I was really playing god, deciding for god, what should have been god's decision. I know when my life should end. It should end now. So I did, I turned on the gas stove and went and laid on the floor. These little thoughts began to pop into my head. Are you really ready for this? Do you really know what waits for you in eternity? Are you really prepared for this? I couldn't answer those questions. I can look back now and I do believe that was the voice of the lord. It scared me so badly. I get up from the floor, turn off the gas stove and I'll never forget it. I said this to myself, this is just the way I'm born. God messed up on me. I'm a mistake. This is just the way it's meant to be obviously, so I'm going to stop fighting it. The rest of 1980 through my graduation in '81, I went headlong into this relationship with another young man and you give yourself to who you think you're meant to be and you expect peace to come. I really did. I remember feeling like I expect peace to come. I remember being in bed with this guy I was in a relationship with and he said, you know what? You never say that you're homosexual, but you are. I said, I just don't like to say that. He said, you need to admit it to yourself. This is just the way you are. So I remember saying it out loud for the first time with the guy. I'm a homosexual. That whole summer, I got more miserable than ever. So I decided I'll cut off this relationship I'm in, because all I feel is used. They were calling it love. It was nothing but being used. That's all it was. It was selfish. Any sin gets a self-focus, guys. It's all about me, me, me, and that's how I had become, so I cut off this relationship I'm in. I say this to myself, god didn't meet me at obu. The answer is awaiting me at seminary. I'll go onto seminary. I already tried suicide. I might as well try seminary. I don't see how one could be worse than the other. Anyway, three days before I'm to go to seminary, a buddy of mine calls. He said, Dennis, the lord's been speaking to me about you. And I thought to myself, god doesn't speak to me about me, so what's he saying to this dude? Seriously. He said the lord came to me in a dream and in this dream, Dennis, god was giving you music and people all over the world are singing your songs. It was one of those dreams that you wake up and you know what you dreamed and it sticks with you. It's not going to leave you alone. It just hung on with me. So I was living at home at the time, saving some money and I mentioned the dream to my mother. I said, "mom, I had this dream about Dennis jernigan." And she had known Dennis as well, and I told her what the dream was about. She said, I had the same dream last night. Really, mom? I'd written maybe five or less songs by that point. I had become so discouraged. So here's my friend telling me that god's going to give me music. People all over the world are going to sing it. He said, my mom had the same dream and it's not a coincidence. We've been talking. Would you consider moving to Oklahoma city? 3405 wilfred Avenue. Move with us. Give god a chance to work in your life. So three days later, instead of going to seminary, I'm living in del city, Oklahoma. It was very clear. Dennis and I were great friends. We had a lot of laughs together and got along great. He felt very comfortable with me and I with him. There were still those times that it was difficult, because he was, in a way, tormented. God's word says in hebrews, a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways. That was my description. I felt like I was losing my mind. Here's homosexuality calling my name. Here's my friend, Chuck, everyday telling me the things the lord is telling him. I'm being pulled in two opposite directions: Homosexuality. Here's what the lord is saying. I'm double-minded. It was really clear that while Dennis was very gifted with music, there was also a dark side to his personality and he struggled a lot with depression and frustration. I think that can be so typical of people who are extremely gifted. One of the things I did early on was I didn't know what to do, so I would take my Bible, set it on the piano and open my Bible to psalm 1 and begin singing. I've literally sung through the psalms on several occasions just to save my own sanity. I began to discover that all the psalmists, not just David, but all of them were just bluntly honest with the lord. My goodness. Think of this: David committed adultery, David committed murder, yet he's remembered in the word as being a man after god's own heart. And I thought, well, my goodness. I'm in his league of sin, so maybe god will meet me here too. So I just began singing through the psalms and then through the process of that, began writing my own psalms to the lord. In fact, psalm 23. ♪ The lord is my Shepherd ♪ I shall not want ♪ he makes me lay down ♪ down in green pastures, ♪ he leads me beside quiet water ♪ Chuck found out what I was struggling with and just confronted me one night. By confronted, it was just the most gentle, loving thing anybody had ever done in a confrontational sense. But he said, Dennis, I know you're struggling with homosexuality. It scared me so badly. I just remember I ran out of the room, ran right out into the street and just began running and running. And all I could think of was my life is over. My life is ruined. This was my last hope. This was my last friend. How can I ever face anyone ever again? Now the news is out. I'm done. You know what Chuck said to me? He said, "Dennis, I don't know how to help you, but I know I know the answer." "What?" "Yeah. I don't know how to help you, but I know the answer." I said, "what's that?" He said, "the answer is Jesus." I said, "Chuck, I've heard that my whole life. He hasn't done anything for me." He said, "not like this, you haven't." He said, "I believe Jesus is the answer so much, "that here's what I'm willing to do for you. "Would you be willing to just walk towards Jesus together? "Whatever it takes, I'll guarantee this: "As long as I have breath, I will walk with you. "If you fall down, I won't kick you. "I won't mock you. "I won't say, I told you so. "You know what I'll do for you? "I'll just help you up every time if you'll let me. "You need a shoulder to cry on? "I'm your guy. "You need someone to yell at "when you just don't know what to say, "you're so frustrated? "Yell at me. I can take it." I saw my role as a stabilizer for Dennis in getting to know him and loving him and appreciating him and the gifts that were in him. I just wanted to be a friend to him. I wanted to help him. I wanted to be a friend that sticks closer than a brother and be there for him for whatever. And then that band, the second chapter of acts, lo and behold, November 7, 1981, were going to be in concert at Lloyd noble arena, university of Oklahoma. I get there early enough so nobody could see me sneak in with my cassette recorder and three blank tapes, because I'm going to get a three album set that night. It's called bootlegging. It is sin, it is illegal, but god is merciful. I got to record my own deliverance. During the concert, they're singing a song called "mansion builder." ♪ Why should I worry? ♪ Why should I fret? ♪ I've got a mansion builder who ain't through with me yet. ♪ And they stopped singing and big sister Annie began to prophesy. Now mind you, there's 4,500 people there. She says, "the holy spirit's told me "there is somebody here tonight who's gone through things "you never dreamed you'd have to go through. "He wants me to tell you that he sees everything "you think you're hiding. "Whatever it is, he loves you anyway. She said, "we're going to sing over you and as we do, "we want you to do just one simple thing. "We want you to get honest with the lord, "because he already sees those things you're hiding and he loves you anyway." And she said, "it doesn't matter what it is" and for some reason, that clicked with me. It doesn't matter what it is. She said, "as we sing over you, "we want you to do this simple thing. "Pretend it's Christmas morning. "Take the things you're most ashamed of, "your sin, your failure, your wounds, "give them to Jesus. "Put them on his shoulders "like a gift given away on Christmas morning. "On Christmas, you don't just give gifts away. "You receive gifts. What do you need from father?" You know what I knew I needed? To know he loved me. They began to sing. I did what she said. My heart began to break and all you can hear on that little tape is them singing and me sobbing. The most asked question of my life honestly, was your healing instant or has it been a process? And the answer is yes. In an instant, I was made a brand new creation. I don't identify myself as a recovering homosexual, never have, never will. I am signed, sealed, delivered, utterly irrevocably who my father says I am: A new creation. Here's the process. A great analogy god gave us when Lazarus was in that grave. He came forth how alive? 100% alive, but he wasn't free, was he? Jesus said to those around Lazarus, loose from him the grave clothes. All I've been doing since 1981 is walking towards Jesus saying, show me, father, the things I thought define me that really don't. Let's rip those away and I will worship you in that area with my true identity. I walked away that night and decided I've been duped all these years. I really have been duped. I've been going to man to find out what a man is supposed to be. I've been going to human thinking as if it's the highest thought ever when I needed to be going to my creator all along for my true identity. After all, it's he who made me. It stands to reason he should be the one telling me who I am. So I decided right then and there I'm not going to let the gay community tell me any longer who I am. I'm not going to let even the temptations that I experience, because they didn't stop right away. They didn't. I'm not going to be defined by what tempts me and the reason that I came to that conclusion was my mind was flooded with thoughts like this. Jesus was tempted in every manner just as we are. That's what the word says, yet without sin. So that tells me very clearly temptation defines nobody, so stop letting it define who you are, jernigan. Stop it. I decided then and there, my past failures will no longer define me. My present circumstances will no longer define me. I'm not even going to define me. I'm going to let my father in heaven tell me who he says I am. Sing this with me. Let us bless the lord. ♪ Who can satisfy my soul like you ♪ ♪ who on earth could comfort me and love me like you do ♪ ♪ who could ever be more faithful, true ♪ ♪ I will trust in you ♪ yes, I will trust in you, my god ♪ ♪ there is a fountain who is the king ♪ ♪ victorious warrior ♪ lord of everything ♪ my rock, my shelter ♪ my very own ♪ blessed redeemer who reigns upon the throne ♪ ♪ blessed redeemer who reigns upon the throne ♪ ♪ who reigns upon the throne ♪ who reigns upon the throne hallelujah! Thank you, lord. When the lord began to change me, I just began to wonder, are you changing me in every area of my life, father? "Yes, son. I'll teach you who you are as a man." "You mean, even sexual arousal?" "Yes, son. Who do you think made you to be a sexual being?" So much healing came between 1981 and 1983 that god allowed me to do something I never thought I would get to experience in this life and that's marry a woman. We went into our dating relationship, and even into our engagement, knowing that we each had a past. I knew enough that I didn't know what his past was, but we shared that we had some past struggles. He didn't know about mine, but we didn't need to go into details and we just agreed to leave it at that. So he also gave me a gift and he just said, I see you as a spotless bride and that was a treasure. So in a way, our relationship was restored even before we were married to that place where the lord had really wanted us to begin. And it was a great picture of what the lord does for us, even in our darkest and dirtiest times. The lord says, "come." He says, "I see you as the bride: Spotless, beautiful, pure" and that was the gift we gave to each other. She was out running on the track one evening and one of her roommates said, "Dennis this would be a great opportunity "for you to go out and protect her. She needs some protection." So I just happened to be at the track when she's there. That wasn't our first kiss, but it was at the track, our first kiss was. When was our first kiss? At the track. That's what I thought. But it wasn't that first night. It wasn't. I didn't make a move? Was it the first night? I don't remember. I don't know, but it was good, whenever it was. Thank you. You're welcome. I remember our wedding night. I really was scared to death that I would not be able to perform. Little did I know that not only would I be able to perform, but I felt no guilt. I felt no shame for the first time. Never been any difficulty in our sex life. That's one blessing that the lord's given both of us, because we've been both used so much. It all works really great. I have no complaints and I don't think he does either. As intimate as Melinda and I were in our marriage, I still always felt there was a veil between us because I wasn't completely honest. And then one night during a time of worship, I became very convicted about that very fact and by this time, we had four kids. And the lord reminded me of a very simple passage in the word. Psalm 107:1-2 says this: "Oh, give thanks to the lord, for he is good. "For his loving kindness is everlasting. "Let the redeemed of the lord say so, whom he has set free from the hand of the adversary." And I thought, wow. I'm supposed to say so. In fact, the holy spirit really convicted me. He said, "Dennis, "if you who have been redeemed "don't say what you've been redeemed from, "how are those in the same bondage going to know "there's even hope? "I want you to begin telling your story. Start with your wife." So I went and I expected to lose my marriage. I expected to lose everything. I was really nervous. I didn't know. I thought he was going to die or had a disease or something. Then he told me about his past and I was like, that's it? That's all? Now let me tell you about mine and we can both be clean. Talk about the veil being ripped away between two people. What I thought had been an intimate marriage went into the stratosphere from that point. We still love each other. We're still passionate about each other. He still makes my heart flutter. Melinda and I early on decided we wanted all the kids god would give us. We had 9 kids in 10 years. When people say that I had those 9 kids just to prove something, that's the furthest thing from the truth. You know why I had those children? I wanted every blessing god would give me. He calls them a blessing, then I wanted all the life he would give me. I felt so robbed of life for so long that I said when I got married, lord, give us all the life you will. And look what I would have been robbed of. I see our marriage and our family as a journey. It's not ever finished. The generations to come will be our greatest success. ♪ For all that you've done, I will thank you ♪ ♪ for all that you're going to do ♪ ♪ for all that you've promised, and all that you are, lord ♪ ♪ is all that has carried me through ♪ ♪ so Jesus, I thank you ♪ yes, I thank you and I thank you ♪ ♪ thank you ♪ lord, thank you ♪ thank you, lord, ♪ thank you for loving and setting me free ♪ ♪ thank you for giving your life just for me ♪ ♪ how I thank you ♪ Jesus, I thank you ♪ gratefully thank you ♪ thank you When my kids were little, Melinda and I really debated, should we tell them about your past? So I've gone to all my kids, but I remember going to my oldest son especially, and saying, son, what do you think of my story? What do you think of your dad? Because it would just break my heart if I thought he was displeased with me. You know what he said to me? He said, "dad, I'm so proud of who you are. "I'm so proud of what god's done in your life "and I want you to keep telling your story. You need to keep telling your story." I don't really think it's changed at all. We don't feel any different about him... ...now than we have from the beginning. Do you think it has? No, we just accepted what he had done and had been. He was starting a career as a music writer and singer and he was going to come out so to speak to tell his life story to begin with on television. That's when he came down and made a trip down here on purpose beforehand to tell us. We didn't have anything to put up with. We just accepted him and went from there. I had my dad's affection all the time, I just didn't realize it. I took him on a trip a few years ago and asked him about that. I said, daddy, why did you never tell me you love me? You know what he said to me? "My dad never told me, so I didn't know how to tell you." I just asked him one simple question and one honest answer broke, just what I call generations worth of curses on my family. We built up our communication in a huge way that day. I like that picture. What is that? That's your grandma jernigan and all four of you guys. When I was in my mid-30's, I came back here to boynton, Oklahoma to have a little night of worship. And after the service, this little gray haired lady named June Smith comes up to me and she had been one of my grandmother's prayer partners. She said, "isn't it wonderful how your grandmother's prayers have been answered?" I honestly didn't know what she was talking about. So I said, "what are you talking about?" She said, "you don't know?" I said, "no. Would you please tell me?" She said, "remember when you were a little boy "and you'd go to your grandmother's house and play the piano?" I said, "yeah." "Did you know that she'd stand behind you and pray for you "and ask the lord to use you in the area of worship and music for his kingdom and his glory?" I said, "I had no idea. How do you know that?" She said, "son, every week for years, "she came to our weekly women's prayer meeting and asked us "to agree with her that god would do that very thing, and son, we still do." ♪ Nobody fills my heart, like Jesus. ♪ ♪ Nobody thrills me like you do. ♪ He still ministers to me even though he's my husband.

What would you like to say? ♪ Nobody fills my heart like Jesus ♪ ♪ nobody thrills me like you do ♪ ♪ oh nobody fills my heart like Jesus ♪ I never plan to retire, because god is so big, so creative, so immense that I don't think we'll ever run out of ideas. My dream is that they'll find me keeled over at the piano one day. What led me to repentance? Jesus loved me even in the homosexuality. Even in the depravity I was living in, he loved me right then and there. But the good news is he loved me enough to not leave me there. I remember hoping somebody would tell me freedom was possible, so that's why I let my life be what it is. I've gotten this several times, "you're doing more damage than good by telling somebody they don't have to be homosexual." I'm not telling anybody they have to do anything. I'm just telling them god loves them and here's how god loved me. This is what I was struggling with. This was my story, but this is what my god did. The same god is available to every human being. That's the reality. Sin leads to destruction. Sin leads to death. If I, being a good father, saw one of my children heading out into traffic and I did nothing about it, I didn't say anything to them and they were hit by that car eventually, people would judge me. They would condemn me. I'm just trying to tell as many people as possible, "hey, wait a minute. "You're heading for the traffic. "You may not experience it now. "You may not be hit by that car right now, but it's coming. It's coming." Nobody wants to be told they're wrong unless they recognize it's hurting them. I just saw the destructive side of homosexuality in my own life and I would have been a liar if I had not admitted it was there. Jesus said, let those without sin cast the first stone. I'm not going to cast a stone on anyone. I'm just going to love whoever you are. I don't have to agree with you to love you. 2 corinthians 5:17: "If any man be in Christ, he is a new creation. The old is gone, everything is made new." That's true and it's a daily choice whether or not we choose to walk in the spirit, to live for god, or to live by the sinful nature. And that goes for anybody, no matter what they struggle with. It's a daily choice. I painted this for you. No way. I felt like since you shared your art with me and gave me a box full of cd's when I was like 17-- oh my goodness. -- I'd share my art with you. Oh, cool. Okay, I see this. The new guy coming out. That's awesome. I'm thankful for Dennis, just for his bravery and his courage to step out in the identity that god gave him, not what the world gave him. God's done a real work in his life and if he hadn't spoken out, I would've never heard. I'm sure I would've heard it somewhere down the road, but there's so many voices in our culture that are telling us how to be, how to live, what to believe in. And then there's some of those voices that are just more muffled than others. Dennis just took a while to get to me, but I know he's affected so many people. I'll never stop telling my story, but the pressure is these days, to be quiet, to not say anything. And at the rate things are going, who knows? I've got to prepare for if it even becomes considered hate speech for me to tell my own story, which sounds outlandish, but it's a real possibility. I will not be silent. I will not stop telling my story. As long as one other person tells me, "I need hope," then I'm there. Some people might not like it, but what Dennis has belongs to Dennis. It's his life and he's chosen to lay that life down and share a message that with god, nothing is impossible, that god has the ability to change and transform and redeem and restore and bless. That's what the result of his life has been. The church has gotten so many things wrong through the years, so it's no wonder to me that people think, maybe you're missing it here on homosexuality too. Here's all I can say to that: I know my own life. I know what my life was like. I'm a different person than I was 30 some odd years ago. I am. I didn't do this to me. God did this to me. God set me free. He's the savior. He's the redeemer, not Dennis jernigan. I've just built my relationship with him and he's been so merciful to teach me who he is and in the process, I've discovered who he says I am. How can that be wrong? How can that be wrong? The friend of mine that first saw this house and told Melinda and I about it had this cool idea for my birthday one year. He gave me one of my favorite gifts anyone's ever given me. It's my own personal tombstone. It says "jernigan November 7, 1981 - "on this date, Dennis jernigan died to sin "and was born again by the grace and power "of our lord, Jesus Christ. God's servant lives in the house at the top of the hill." One of my favorite things is when people drive by, you can see them slow down, because the road's just a few feet away -- always looking to see who's buried there? Who's buried there? And I can't help but think, they're going to see that the old Dennis was buried there and maybe get an idea that maybe that can happen for them too. It's just one of the things I pray when I see people slow down and look at this thing. So I wanted it to be by the road for that very reason, because I knew people would wonder who is buried there? Well, it's me, the old me. The lord is showing me that there are many of you tonight that are broken hearted. And many of you have gone through things that you never thought you'd have to go through. You need to be set free tonight. The lord wants to heal your mind and your heart and we'll all have something to get rid of, because we are all being built. The way we are going to get rid of those things tonight is we're going to put our hands up before us like this and we're going to give them to the lord while we sing this song. And then while our hands are up and empty, we're going to receive from him whatever gift it is that he wants to give us tonight. And I guarantee you, it's a good gift. You have nothing to be afraid of. He only wants what's best for you. So it's sort of like Christmas. We're going to give away something and then we're going to receive from him a gift. There is a gift for each one of us with our name on it.
