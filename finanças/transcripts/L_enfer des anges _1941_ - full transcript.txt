This film was restored by path√© in 2019 angels in hell was selected for the first international cannes film festival, to be held September 3rd to 20th, 1939. Initiated by the education minister Jean zay, it was created to compete with the venice film festival, which was under fascist influence. France's entry into the war on September 3rd, 1939 pushed the festival back to 1946. In 2019, the aborted 1939 edition was presented in Orleans, Jean zay's home town. On this occasion, the film won the jury prize and the young public prize. This restored version is that of 1941, year of the film's release. It presents an optimistic end. The writer and the director had planned two. The second version was never shown publicly due to its pessimistic climax. To date, no original sound materials or reference prints of the second version have been found. Angels in hell This film exposes the harsh truth of abandoned, lost, defenseless children, without tenderness in their lives. There must be no more unhappy childhoods in today's France. Those who present this drama only do so in the hope that we will never again see such scenes in real life. Angels in hell is an appeal to the heart, for a collaboration with the state, to protect and save those who are building the France of tomorrow: Our little ones of today. Carpenter What do you want? I'm here for the job. Got any certificates? - Certificates? - Sure. I have papers. "Reformatory... Penal military service." I got nothing for you. Look, mister, I'll do anything. That's just what I'm afraid of. Don't believe that. I'm honest. All I ask is to work hard. You're no good to me. The work here calls for trust. I've been looking for months. Help me survive. It's easy enough. No? So I gotta die? Bad seed. Job offers Thanks. Where do you come from? Reformatory? Yes. Escaped? Recently? This morning. What did you do? When mama died, papa took to drinking. Then a woman came. She didn't like me. She beat me. Papa placed me in a dairy. I visited him twice a month. Sometimes, he wasn't too drunk. And then what? One Sunday, I had no stockings. I took an old pair of the boss's. She found out. She wanted to have me arrested. I ran away. Then a policeman, like the one just now... They call it vagrancy. Yeah, that's their word. They held me four months. That's all. It always starts that way. We go wrong when we lose those who love us. For you, it was your mother... Me, when my father died... We can't stay here. Let's go to my place. Mr. Max, why do you make me drink so much? You must be hungry. A bit. I'm used to it. We'll find something to eat. I don't know, like... You can't be difficult. You and I don't need much to get by on. We're not very happy but some people are worse off. - No, no! - Come here! And it's like this every night. They'll end up killing him. It's not your mother! So what? Say, don't you think we oughta... Oughta what? Are you nuts? It's none of our business. And the kid's used to it by now. Just you wait! - You little bastard! - Don't, papa! Well, old man, you won. That kid of yours would have made our lives hell. You can say that again. So who's to blame? I said we shouldn't have kept him. Oh, him. A proper little weakling. - A regular rich kid. - Yep. What you gonna do with him now? As cooks go, I'm not so great. - It smells good. - Potatoes. Fine nourishing food. You'll see. Taste it. Mashed potato, like when you're sick. Thank you. I haven't eaten this for ages. We're doing fine, huh? Sure. - My little dinner's not so bad? - Oh, no. Eat up, sweetie. Someone's coming. It's only Simone coming home. She's very nice. - Hello. - Hello, dear. Hey, you got a guest? Yes, you see... - Hello, ma'am. - Hello. You must have found some work. No, not yet. Too bad. Where were you? I was having a drink with Max. I hate you seeing that rat. There's no one else around. - Simone... - What? - Nothing. - So much the better. Eat up, girl. That's our dinner. Will you shut up? Why? She should know how we eat. - Aren't you ashamed? - No. But you should be. You make me live in squalor. With one dress! An ugly one. I've had enough! - You're drunk? - I drink to forget. Instead of picking up kids and feeding them here, you should think about me. You imagine I'm happy? I do my best. You give me nothing. Nothing. Nothing ever! Just misery. And I have to share it. Calm down, honey. Simone! I ucette! I ucette! Why are you crying? It's nothing. Do you live here? No. Do you? I almost did. I'm lucette. And you? Me? I'm called... That's funny, my head's gone all empty. I don't know any more. What don't you know? Come on, this way. What's on your forehead? Are you hurt? Yes. Is it painful? No. Maybe a car ran you down? I can't remember. I woke up on an empty lot. Then you have no parents? Yes, I do. So you're on your way home? Yes. But I don't know where it is. We mustn't stay out on the street at night. We'll be arrested. Shall we go in here? - If you like. - Come on. Sit down here. What do your parents look like? I've forgotten. I'm trying to remember. It's funny. What's the matter with me? It's nothing. But it seems to me... They were nice. You know... I was happy. You're lucky. But how will I find them? We'll see tomorrow. You're tired. You need to sleep. You're nice. As you can't remember your name and my name is lucette, do you want to be lucien? If you like. Good night. We'll go get some shuteye! I'm in no hurry to go home. My old man must still be drunk. I'm ok. My old man's in a penal colony. Glad to get home to my little castle. 'Night, guys. See ya tomorrow. What's this? Kids? Where'd they come from? No, honestly! It's an invasion. Hey, clear off. This is my place. If you sleep in my apartment, where do I go? They sleep so soundly. They're a real pain. Stay where you are, youngsters. I'll come back in the morning. We'll put the safety lock on. Telephone out of order what a godawful shame. You must be starved. It's chow time. Come on. It's a quiet spot. Hold on to the handrail. It's shaky. No women allowed the concierge is on the stairs go sit down, children, while I get the rations out. Eat up, children. It will get you back on form. It's funny here. It's the museum of my local buddies. They're all collectors. They grab anything they find, even when it's not for grabs. Then they bring it here to their conservatory. - Rene! - Hello, daddy hawkeye. I didn't see you, fella. Hiding away behind your machine? Yeah. They don't call you Mr. science for nothing. - Nope. - Always searching, inventing... Gotta do what you gotta do. Say there! - It's looking good. - It's coming along. Inventions are our only way out of here. You know, we're almost there. I was sure of that, my boy. I'm glad for the buddies who trusted me. Bravo. Very nice. Here come the gang. Hey, Paul! Hey, daddy hawkeye. - How's it going, kids? - Not bad. And you? Take a look at this. Talk about work. Going well, pal? Not bad. Not bad at all. - Will it be long now? - You bet it won't. I was nearly there. And I got it. The sand comes down this way, comes back here, and goes up here. No reason for it to stop. And bingo! About time. Hey! Look, guys. So what's this? What are they doing here? As you can see, they're eating. I can see that. First of all, this is our place. Your place? You're exaggerating. And that? - She's a girl, can't you see? - Sure I can see it. But can't anyone read? I forget when I have to. We don't know him. We don't want him! One minute. Hold on. Aren't you ashamed of acting like swells? Shame on you. I ook at these two kids. Don't you see where she came from? Why not call the cops while you're at it? And him and his poor broken mug! He's a bit loony. He can't remember a thing. He lost his memory. It's none of our business. Nor mine neither. But they snoozed in my phone booth. And I'm feeding them, me, the old man. Understand? In that case, daddy hawkeye, take them to Marie laplanche. Just say I sent them. Marie will deck them out. So that settles it. Skedaddle, you lot. I'm busy with this gentleman. Ok. Come on, kids. Follow me. Honestly... Get those two. Where do they come from? The old man found 'em in a garbage can! She's cute. Hi, daddy hawkeye. - Hi, handsome. - Flatterer. Butts aren't enough? Gotta pick up kids now? I'm not asking you to feed them. Why not? I wouldn't mind. - Always a bit of a bastard. - Always a bit selfish. Give me a liter of red. - The dregs, of course? - Dregs like you. You got a nice smock. Not pretty, but it's good fabric. - What? - You a connoisseur? I appreciate nice things. You're slimy as a slug. It takes all sorts. Come on, guys. Forget him. Those two kids are nice. I think I could take an interest in them. - Got a match, Mr. Max? - Sure, moon face. Don't ruin your health. What a fine fate line! It will take you to Guyana. To Guyana? What for? To break rocks. Rocks there grow of a piece. You have to break them. See? There you go, kid. Say, you're a serious boy. Want to work for me? It involves selling razor blades. Your brother does it. Paul is lazy. He's not reliable. Thanks but no thanks. - I know your schemes. Dope and that... - Dummy. I had women by the thousands but, alas, only one mother It's time you found a job. You can't live on love alone. - Simone, don't be mean. - Just words. I'm 20 years old. Time goes by. I was that age in prison. It's worse. "Two pigeons loved each other tenderly "they fought over seeds..." Eavesdropping now? Very rarely. Excuse me. Hello, Max. What a pretty hand. Fine, distinguished. May 17? I see money. Lots of money. Money? Where? In your palm, my dear. You were made for a happy existence. The beauty of people and objects should bathe you in luxury, ease and comfort. Comfort? Tell me about it. The toilets are in the courtyard. - Best not go in there. - Patience. - Max... - What? Do you believe in the lines of the hand? - Me, no. - So? I believe in what I see. What do you see? I see the future. Really? Then tell me if I'll find employment soon? Employment? Still job hunting? You don't give up. I looked for work too, once. I had college degrees, a lot of drive... - You didn't find work? - No. So I figured it out. I understood 10 years ago. I don't want to discourage Jean. No way! Jean is a smart, honest guy with a future. - It's true, he has references. - References? Reformatory, then penal military service. Employers will love that. Get off my back! I was only trying to give you some advice. You make me sick... He's a bag of nerves! Insulting my friends won't get you work. - So this gentleman is a friend? - Sure he is. - This louse is a friend? - How charming he is. I see the people I like! And you... I'm out of here! I'll be back when he's gone. Jean is turning violent. Does he beat you? - Not even. - He will. Sooner or later. He's a decent fella. A bit dumb, dependable. But I wonder if he's the right man for you? So do I. I don't like to see you languishing in a slum. Wasting your youth. Youth is so beautiful. Yeah. It don't line your pockets. Some people wouldn't agree with that. To start with, you need a nice quiet life in the country. I have a friend who'd look after you. What would I have to do? Nothing. Well, nothing much. He entertains a lot. Real sugar daddies, not fussy, very generous. You'd confide in me and send me little money orders. And I'd invest your savings. Swell, huh? How about it, doll? Right. Here's the address. I'll put it in your bag with cash for your ticket. There's a good train at 12. Life can be so simple. My little girl. Lousy weather. Who gives a damn? Lucette! Over here! - How come you're around? - I live at Marie laplanche's. - Lucien? - A little boy I met last night. He can't remember his parents. And he's sick... Tell me later. You mustn't be seen here. I'll get your grog. Go back to Marie's. A nice hot grog. - Got a cold, Jean? - No. - It's for mrs Simone? - Yes. A cold is nothing serious. Here. One fifty. - Good and strong. - Thanks. - Take the spoon. - Thanks. He's not chatty today. - Who is he? - Jean balard. - What does he do? - Looking for work. So he says. Can't find any. So he says. Any new action in the neighborhood? No, dead calm. Wise up. Calm before the storm. They live on sunlight. Yep, the sunshine usually brings the vermin out. Anyway, if anything new crops up, call me as usual? Sure thing. Goodbye. Hello, children. Hello, Marie. Adopted some more kids? Daddy hawkeye brought them here so... So you took them in. Lucette, your grog. Having a nice splash? I met him on the bridge, he's very kind. Hello, sir! Hello, my boy. - Isn't he handsome? - Yes, very. Lucette, give me a hand. We going to be buddies? Just wait till you're better. I'm fine, they make me stay in bed. - They're right. - I'll be well tomorrow. Drink this while it's hot. Drink up. Or you'll be in trouble. Women are tricky. What's going on? Fighting, huh? He's got it in for me! We're not fighting, we're playing mom and dad. - There are no kids any more. - Max, gimme a walnut. Drop it, grown-ups only hand out punches. What an education. What will this contraption do? We already told you. It's the perpetual movement machine. It's simple. Don't you get it? Yes, I know that. But what's perpetual movement? He's a dead loss! A thing that always moves. When it starts it never stops. That's funny! Why don't it ever stop? Because it's perpetual movement! Shut up, guys, be serious. Go ahead, Mr. science. Step back, you never know. It's dangerous there, kid. I et's have silence! Let's go. Is that all? It ain't working. - [It ain't? Hold it. - What you gonna do? - Needs lubricant. - Lubri... what? I dunno. Must be a technical term. He may be right, it needs oil. But why does he pour on so much? Who's the technician, you or me? Me. You're tiring out the technician. That's ok. Here, hold this. One, two, three. Damn. It worked for longer. I'm getting there, not far now. You used too much oil. It's no good. No good. Don't get mad, but we need that thing of yours. - It would help, for sure. - What's it like? It's like this, and this, and this. Yeah. How much is it? 65 francs. Some bargain! How much is in the cashbox? - 67 francs. - After all we collected? Bullshit. You went on a spree. - What are you getting at? - Yeah. I see. If you don't trust me, take over the accounts. Break it up. It hurts, 65 francs for junk like that. Forget it, everyone agrees. You're in the minority. I guarantee perpetual movement. We'll have it. Then we're out of here. - What will we do? - Open our own garage. Look at julot! Hi, fellas. Ain't I a swell? Get him! You didn't keep your sea dog outfit for long. I swapped it. More stylish. - You look like a foreigner. - Exotic. All he needs is a fob watch! Drop it, guys. On with perpetual movement! It's funny! I'll be darned... - Hey, guys! - Get the vehicle. Hey, no name, get over here! Your dad's looking for you. Where's my son? Where is he? Have you seen my son? I'm looking for my son. Have you seen my son? Sorry, folks. Seen my son anywhere? Where is the boy? Have you seen my son? You haven't seen my son anywhere? - Why do that to him? - For a laugh. Shame on you. He never hurt you. Cut it out. Drop it. Hey! How about doing some work? Sure, your work! I'm sick of that lousy work. Sick of what? Take the goods: Be on the corner of rue Barry at 6. Got it? It stinks, it'll end badly. The cops are onto us. Sure, I must think of everything. You need an angel face with you, in case there's a screw up. We're onto it. What's up, kid? C'mon. They're more dumb than mean. I have an idea. To find your parents, put an ad in the papers. But I have no money. He has no money. Dead easy... What? Selling razor blades. - Max... - What do you think, Paul? I'm up for it! What a cutie. Run along with my brother. He'll show you, I'll pay you tomorrow. Thank you, Mr. Max. Off you go, youngster. Get going. I can't stand that man. Thank you, Mr. Max. It's normal. And if you're ever in trouble, it could happen, coming from where you did, you can count on me. What are you saying? Nothing, just chatting. Go home, lucette. Max, leave lucette alone. Or I'll sort you out. You're been unjust with me since Simone left. But I did all I could. I kept telling her: "Be patient, "Jean is a lad with a future." But there you go. She's a cheap little hustler. Ever had your face smashed? Astronomy hall of scientific discovery bookshop Here it is. Have a look. - Serious stuff. - That's some book. Need any help? We want this book. Perpetual movement? What's that to you? This gentleman is an inventor. It's a very expensive book. We know. 65 francs. What did you expect? Pay him for it. Give us the book. You don't mind small change? If you like. If it was on a street stall, we'd have nicked it. C'mon, forget it. Say, old man, 65 francs! I gotta work with no name. A word of advice: You better lie low. I'm forced to do it. It won't last long. Hey, get back to the barge and start reading the book! You come with me. Move it! How's the razor blade business? It's got its ups and downs. I'm doing it for my brother, to teach him to get by. He seems smart. He is indeed. Just a bit lazy. He'll manage. I hope. And I'm there. - Hello, folks! - Daddy hawkeye! Long time no see. You know how it is. Business first. Always a pleasure to see you. Likewise, my friend. Thank you. N√©nesse, I'll have a white wine with syrup, please. It makes you edgy. Ok. Right. Max, there's a message for you. A buddy heard your brother's in a jam. A jam? He was arrested. My brother arrested? I wonder why... Maybe he broke the law. After all I've done for him. Shame on him. - Look, you're not to blame. - Certainly not. When your conscience is clear... Yes, sure. But it's humiliating. Yes. Yes... Yes, I must be going. Hello. Happy tonight, little lady? Yes, I found a job with a man who sells stamps. - He's called a philatelist. - Work for lazy layabouts. - Are you alone? - Yes, why? Can you keep this for me? All right. Is it fragile? No. Just family mementos. They'll be safer here than in my place. Here's my little buddy. I'm not your buddy! You're a punk. - Lucien! - A lousy punk! Paul was arrested, he put this in my pocket. Gimme that and shut up. No! I'll say it was you... Cut it out! Hide that suitcase. We won't keep it here. Take your filth away. Indeed? You're at my mercy, you'll do what I want. - I won't keep it! - You will. Forgotten where you ran from? I can have you sent back there. - I don't care. - No, you wouldn't do that. It depends on you. Is it yes or no? You see? Lucien understands. He's bright for his age. With me, everyone always gets on. It's pleasant. Right, cutie? He's a nice kid. When I'm grown up you'll never fear anyone again. It's a dull life without any surprises. I'll have to get involved in good works. Are you kidding? Kind of. They searched your place? Looking for what? How should I know? I was set up again. Poor old man. Your sympathy warms my heart. How much longer is your little scam going to last? You use those poor kids. Listen, Jean... Bastards like you corrupt them. Nobody cares, their parents don't exist. We turn a blind eye, the kids always pay. Weak children against shits like you! - Let me go! - Bastard! Bravo, Mr. Jean! Bingo! You wanted surprises, you got one! Right. Thanks. Give me a pick-me-up. What's going on in there? Jean just clobbered Max. A shot to the chin, an uppercut... That's not funny! - I didn't want to ruin your tux. - I was demonstrating. Some demonstration! You should've seen him clobber Max. Max had it coming. He's a real rat. What did you call my brother? Paul, they let you go? What did you say about my brother? That he's a real rat. It's no secret. It's almost in the papers. Come over here, let's talk! Only I have the right to say that he's a rat. He's a bastard. He's a bastard! A bastard, you hear! You're outta line! Gimme that! Guys! The barge! - The invention. - The book. There goes the perpetual motion. And everything with it. Everything. Cheese it, the cops! - Nice toy. - So what? You won't get away this time. I didn't do anything. What did I do? Reformatory It's noon, Mr. petitot. Can I go? Of course you can. Listen. After lunch, on your way here, take this stamp to Mr. favre, rue de I'ecuyer. Yes, sir. It always hurts to part with these little masterpieces. What a pity not to keep these marvels. Well, some sacrifices are necessary. Take care of this rare piece. Yes, Mr. petitot. Goodbye, sir. See you later. Aren't you bored with your stamps? No. Now that I have a job, I feel safe. Nothing scares me. When I can, I look at the stamps. There are incredible ones with beautiful landscapes! You can't imagine. There must be birds too, but you don't see them. - Sure, they're too small! - That's true. You know, lucien, I had a dream last night. We were on a desert island in the middle of a deep blue sea. Just you and me, the sun, the trees! And lots of flowers. It felt so good. It's a dream that no one could have had. It's because of stamps, because of you. Because the buddies say I'm a bit stumped! No! I'm so fond you, lucien. We two aren't so unhappy. The days pass fast since you arrived. Yeah, but there's no end to them. I'm bored. - You're bored with me? - That's not what I mean. I miss my parents. I don't understand. They must be looking for me. Hey, son! Do you know the rue de I'eglise? - The rue de I'eglise? - It's around here? - Second on your left. - Thanks, son. Here's 20 cents. Buy some candy. - No, it's ok. - Take it, don't be silly. Coming? What's the matter? That man seemed nice. Miss! Like some flowers? Thank you. I made violets in prison. But they had no scent. Yours smell good. Like the desert island. I ain't got nothing to call my own my only baggage is misery my heart doesn't belong to me it makes my blood boil nothing keeps me here I don't feel no pity I ain't got a cent I don't give a damn I pawned my heart... The dead boy! My boy? You're seeing things! I'm telling you I saw him. If he was dead, it would've been in the papers. You should've checked after. But you ain't got no curiosity. I didn't dare. This kid brings in a lot, and when I pinch him, he bawils. They pity us. But the mother rents him for 8 francs a day. I gotta carry him. My arms ache. We were better off with your kid. Where'd you see him? Over by Henri iv district. I'd better take a look there. After all, he's my kid. He belongs to me. Look, where is she? In the wheelbarrow? And the little birdie... See the little birdie? They're looking for a boy of 14! Dark hair. His parents live in neuilly. It must be me. Neuilly sounds pretty. I think I remember it. - Are you going there? - Sure, right now! Good luck. Do you think they're his parents? No. But you never know. If he leaves, what about me? Don't be selfish, lucette. He can't stay forever. Why not? He's not in anyone's way. But his family. I'd have liked to keep him. It's not that easy. Look at me and Simone. We can't always keep those we love. That's why we feel sad. Hello! What do you want? I'm here for the ad, the missing boy. - You're here for me? - For you? Sure, I'm the one who was missing. Then I might as well leave. No. You look tired. You can get some rest. Come in. Well talk. I'll tell you about my adventures. Lucky you came today, not tomorrow, my folks are taking me on vacation. That must be swell. No, vacations are dull. You're always with family, there's no adventure. There are no surprises. Here, these are my parents. - They look nice. - I like them a lot. So why hurt them? I don't know, I can't help it. What do you expect? All they know is Paris. Paris isn't anything on the world map. I et's have a drink. You know, I'm a man of action. I want to see the world. The desert, the Sahara, the mountains, the redskins, buffalo bill. Everything. I've run away four times. They always catch me. But I'll make it. I want to go to marrakesh. Marrakesh, can you imagine it? Come on, I'll show you. Come look. Come on. Marrakesh is here. They say it's all white. - Where do you live? - In the Henri iv district. Where's that? The other side of Paris. It's far. I must be going. I could go in your place. It would be my first stage. And you stay here. My folks would have a little boy. But they'd make a fuss again. It's funny. I'm trying to find my parents, you're trying to go away. But it's so lovely here. It was like a castle with turrets. With lots of trees all around, like a forest. And statues. Wow! And inside, if you could see it, staircases everywhere, huge windows, and rooms that go on and on. Paintings all over the walls. And gold, even on the furniture. All shining. And there were things in glass cases. Weird things. I couldn't figure out what for. And there were glasses, glasses so fine you don't dare touch them. And books with titles in gold. Curtains all white. It was so beautiful. I'd forgotten all that existed. It's not for poor mugs like us. It will be ours. When we know how to take it. Paull you escaped! You didn't stay long. - Where's your hair? - Relax! It'll grow back. Paul, honey! How did you do it? I'm not some canary in a cage. - You got my letters? - You have time to waste. I'm into the invention. You and your invention! - Poor dope. - I'll make it. We have to start all over. I bought a new book. Look. What's this? The little builder's manual. I've stopped believing in fairy tales. Unless I hear them from no name. Hi, Paul. Come over here. Where's this castle of yours? In neuilly, 5 rue verlaine. Neuilly... A lot of people there? No one. They all left on vacation. Good. Paul, you can't stay here. They'll find you. You must hide. Hiding's no good. I have to split. So I need money. Go back to your socks, girl. Hey, guys! I got me a new outfit. Yeah. We know you're a swell. Take off now. I gotta talk to l√©on. Go on. Hop to it. Hop to it. - C'mon, l√©on. - I'm coming. "Burglary in neuilly, 25,000 francs stolen." 25,000 francs! I only need 500 to get out of here. They're gonna nab me. For sure. This is bad, listen: "A valet was seriously wounded. "He was found unconscious by the main staircase. "Questioned, he could furnish no information about his attacker." Say, they mention no name! When lucette learns that lucien was part of it, she'll be sick. Lucette... Say now... That's an idea. Where are you going? Where you going? To get my 500 francs. What? 500 francs? It's a golden age for philately. Nations are born, they print lovely little stamps. Hop, the regime changes. The stamps too. Countries vanish, new ones appear... We're living in truly exciting postal times. - Isn't that so, my little lucette? - Yes, sir. You don't understand, an innocent young girl like you. You should start your own little collection. - I'd like to, sir. - You must. No better way to take an interest in your work. And it wouldn't cost you much. Courtesy of the good Mr. petitot. Thank you, sir. Philately is not a science without a soul. Indeed, it's an escape into dreams and poetry. Poetry... What's going on? It's about the neuilly job. The cops are looking for no name. Lucien? - Because of his visit yesterday. - But he didn't do anything. Maybe. But he's gotta get out. Otherwise, it means prison. Long term. We gotta save him. You want to save him? Sure, but how? Here's how. I know a guy with a long arm. - Only hitch: It takes money. - But I don't have any. Ask for an advance. 500 francs should do it. 500 francs? My boss will never agree. If he doesn't, there must be money in his till. It's impossible. Everything I've said is to help no name. I'm acting as a friend. You won't have done all you should to help a friend. Anyway, if you decide to, meet me at the warehouse. Go through the empty lot. Sir! Where were you? You look upset. What happened? Mr. petitot... The good Mr. petitot is listening, my little girl. I need money. How much? 500 francs. 500 francs? Just like that, right now? I'll pay you back out of my salary. I beg you, I need it. If you only knew how much. All right. Let's see about that. No appeal to Mr. petitot's kind heart is ever in vain. I'll work unpaid for as long as you like. I never said anything about working unpaid, silly girl! As you like. Indeed, my little lucette, I won't be able to give you those 500 francs. Sorry, angel. - It's ok. - Tis. We didn't need this robbery to complicate our lives. What a sad era. Crime is hitting the headlines every day. No morality. It'll end up with a raid, I'll be the fall guy as usual. A fine kettle of fish! I bet the kid wasn't involved. Of course he wasn't. No name, go get the ball. Lucien, you must hide! Hide? Why? You look miserable. Did your boss fire you? No. You've been crying? It's nothing. I'll tell you later. Listen, you have to hide right now, or they'll arrest you. And what will happen to me if I lose you? Got the money? Here. Did he give it to you? Listen, lucette, I'm sorry, you see, I was forced to. Yes, but please save lucien, I beg you. You mustn't worry. Paul, take a look! Look at this. - That's him! - Which one? - The one without a cap. - You sure? Yes. So you're the snitch for the big heists? - But... - Take him away. What have I done to you? What do you want with me? Let me go! Shame on you to arrest that child. Let him be! - Stay out of this. - He's innocent! Arrest him too. Leave me alone! Lucien! My little lucien... Lucette! What's wrong? Lucette, honey. - Gently... - Don't touch me! But it's me, lucette, daddy hawkeye. You have big hands! A man's hands! Of course I do. Leave me alone. Lucien! I have nothing now! My little lucien, it was all for nothing! Lucette... Leave me alone! I don't want anyone to touch me! I don't want to be seen! Daddy hawkeye, I must tell you something. Oh yeah? Paul and me went to neuilly. So you two did the heist? No. But we saw a man escaping out the window. You didn't recognize him? No. What was he like? Tall? Short? Thin? I don't know, but he seemed... He seemed what? You know, I can't be sure, but there was something... Go on, spit it out. I stepped on a walnut shell. A walnut shell? Yes. And it makes me think of someone. Me too, it makes me think of someone. I can tell you now, I did recognize him. Me too, right away. I'm not surprised by him. What will we do? I don't know. But we'll do something. Come on. What's cooking? You look downbeat. Cheer up, have a drink on me. Patron, a cordial. Something sweet for the kid. You in the money? Yes, I received funds from the provinces. - How was the fair last night? - Not bad. I hear you went with b√©bert? We got back pretty late, yes. - Liar! - What? B√©bert said you went alone. Alone? No, I was with a kid. Not a kid from here, not classy enough. Yes, that's true. But these poor kids need fresh air. Why don't you take them to the country? The suburbs? - The suburbs? - Yes. I'll think it over. It's calm at night in the suburbs, Paris seems far away. I know some gorgeous little spots. We all do. The dance halls on the riverside, marne, nogent. Neuilly. What a nasty noise. You find walnuts everywhere. Well, it's the season. They even grow on floorboards. In neuilly. In neuilly... What's all this about neuilly? Why are you all staring at me like judges? What have I done to you? To us? Nothing. Then get off my back! I'm through with your mean gossip, I'm sick of your ugly mugs. Get the picture? Calm down, Max, you're acting vulgar. He's talking like everyone else now. He must be in a bad way! What are you waiting for? Hey, guys! The cops are here for someone. - Where? - Below in the yard. How charming of you to come and meet me at teatime. Thanks. So long, fellas. Bouboule, my example is worth a lollipop. Be honest. It's better. So that's all sorted. Bye bye, Max. - Daddy hawkeye? - Yes, my boy? "Be honest." What did he mean? "Be honest"? Nothing, he was just kidding. So he never stole a thing! What a bastard. To think we both fought because of him. And I got myself arrested. We must have been dead stupid. - You have my... - Here are your papers. You're free. You now. - Do you have ID? - Yes. Here. But there's no doubt about it. I'm from the neighborhood, they said a kid like this, like that. I recognized him as my son and I raced over here. You can explain to the commissioner later. (Go and sit down. Hello, kid! They released him! They didn't keep you long. And lucien? The law wouldn't let me take him. - The law? - Yes. That's terrible. Where's lucette? We don't know. When the cops took you and lucien, she was shattered. She fainted. She went that way. She was funny. She yelled: "I don't want to be seen or touched!" - You should have stopped her. - We didn't dare. - I saw her heading for the docks. - The docks? Where? I don't know. Hey, guys! A girl just jumped in the river! What? - She went under. - Did you see her? - No, d√©d√© told me. - D√©d√©? - I'm sure it's lucette. - What? - What did you say? - Lucette jumped in! - You're crazy! - It was her! You don't understand anything! Marie, come back! Listen to me, Marie! Come on. No, it's not her. It's impossible. It can't be lucette! No! Stop! Don't do that, you'll be arrested. I don't give a damn! Get it? You can't understand. I'd be in hell if it's her. No. It's her. Why did she do it? Life is hard for these poor little kids. Take a look at us. The water makes sense. I don't even know her name. That doesn't matter. They won't ask her for ID where she is now. They take them as they come. Come, Paul. No. Leave me alone, it's my fault. Why? You're not to blame. She's dead. But I never wanted that. I'm a lousy coward. It's like I pushed her in the water. No, that's not true. It wasn't you. It's all over. I'm alive and she isn't here any more. She'll never be here again. It's unjust. I killed her. I swear I didn't mean to. No, that's not true. It wasn't you. It wasn't you and anyway... I don't want to think about it. I'll always be with you, Paul. Always. Come on, Paul. Come. We treated her rotten. And we were shitty to lucien. But we're not bad at heart. We don't know any better. It's the adults' fault. They don't care about us. This has got to end! We've had enough! Goodbye, officer. I had to go to the cops to find you. Stay on track or I'll teach you. Why? I'm your dad, don't you recognize me? No. What's got into you? You're not my dad, that's not true. Not your dad? I'll show youl! Jean! Filthy little brat! Leave him alone! Stay out of it. He's my kid. - Your kid? - Back off! You bastard! Come on, guys. Action! Hang on in there, Jean. Stop it, kids! They'll kill him! It's not his fault! He wasn't my father? No, lad, he wasn't your father. I knew him, he had no family. I was sure of it. Come on, we're going away, there's nothing for us here. - Jean! - What is it? The hospital called about lucette. You must go there. - Lucette? - Yes, they told me to tell you. - Right now? - Yes. Come on, lucien. - Please, doctor... - Just a minute. Feeling better? Aren't you ashamed, wanting to die at your age? Only thinking of yourself. What about the pain for those who love you? I have no one left. Really? Come in, you three. Lucien! Dear little lucette. Wait out in the corridor. And be quiet! - Shit! - They let them go in. - She'd love to see us. - They get all the breaks! - But we're family too. - Look, guys, a window. - So? - We can enter a room through it. - S07? - He's right. Move! You're here. Don't ever go away. We'll always stay together. Because when I'm not around, you goof up. I wanted to die. I'd never have seen you again. So why did you do it? I et's not talk about it. I'm taking you away. You'll be my children. We'll go to a place with fresh air. Where we can see the stars at night. When there are any. There are always stars. Come with us, daddy hawkeye? No, darling, I'm too old. Being old is horrible. You can't go away anywhere. Take them with you, lad. It's time to let them see some sunshine. Or they'll end up believing it doesn't exist any more. You're in luck. Beautiful days are coming. I say! They're all we need. - Hello, lucette. - Hello. Here, somebody gave you them. Thank you. Who are they from? It's a secret. Paul made me promise not to say. He's nice. Bad seed.
