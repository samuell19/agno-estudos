Mr. Raeburn? It's Cathy Delano from Social Services. We spoke on the phone? I want it, I want the house. I've eaten. See what you can find in the kitchen. You think you know about the nature of my parental responsibility towards you but soon you'll realize that my parental responsibility is not the issue. Food is the issue. Parental responsibility construct is irrelevant. You're still going to bed hungry. Do you understand? Do you finally understand? You've got an audience. That's ridiculous. They look good on you. Got it, Jo. Uh, 8.57. You're those Raeburn kids, right? No, we're the other ones. He likes you. Couldn't take his eyes off you. Well, we're the mysterious recluses who don't go to school, so. You gonna wear those sunglasses I bought for you or what? Take functional relationships. We design the experiments that define them, we give them names, we spend centuries proving and reproving them, but we don't create them. They're invisible machines existing outside of us. I am talking, children, about constants. Jack, gimme an example of a constant. Gravity. Well, you mighta been right 60 years ago before space travel and experimental antigravity aircraft. Josephine. Hook's Law. Which is? The ratio of weight on a spring to the elongation of a spring. Good, the relationship between weight and tension. Always constant, always the same. Nature makes sense, children. We're the ones who fucked it all up. Countries, governments, all false constructs created by the human urge to carve, to parcel, to own. Josephine. You're not eating. Eat. Three more days until he's gone. Two days, one morning. I think you should make friends with that kid from the drugstore. Why? To let us sneak that stuff behind the counter. Maybe you can even try your hand at flirting. Are you kidding? You know the only boy that I talk to is you. No, don't worry. You can talk circles around him. I mean, you had him the moment he saw you. Consider. Friday afternoon, Raeburn comes home in a foul mood as usual, ranting and throwing things and there's you and me in the middle of it like always. Except this time, we dropped a couple Valium a few hours back, and we're feeling no pain whatsoever. And then he throws a plate at my head and I'm too doped to duck. I'll catch it before it hits you. Throw it right the fuck back at him. Or we could just drug his coffee and then he'd leave us alone. Try again. Something other than my old T-shirt. I like your old T-shirt. Trust me. And take down your hair. It's too fucking hot. Uh, where's the toothpaste? Uh, just on your left. Your name is Jo? It um, it's Josie. It's short for Josephine. I just, I heard your brother call you Jo when you guys were here last. Oh. I'm Kevin. So do you go to the movies much? Not often. I, well, do you like music? What's taking you so long? Huh? Hey. This is Kevin. We were talking about music. Oh yeah? What kind? We hadn't really got that far but I'm really into like early jazz, hard bop, that kinda stuff. Oh nice. I just picked up "Blue Train" down in Pittsburgh at Eide's. I haven't been but I hear that they've got everything there. They do. You wanna come by later, listen to some Coltrane, have a couple beers? Okay. Hi. Hi. Um, I like your dress. Thanks, it was my mother's. I've never been in one of these old houses before. My mom's crazy about 'em. She does the historic homes tour every spring. Are you on that? We're not a very open to the public kind of a family. Yeah, I guess not. But I'm sure none of those other houses have as much cool stuff in 'em as yours. Greetings. Hey. Oh, thanks. Yeah. This place is amazing. Looks like it should be haunted. Is it? Only by us. Wait here a minute. I'll be right back. I think it's great that you and your brother are so close. If I had to spend more than 15 minutes with my sister, I think one of us would kill the other. I just think it's different with us. Yeah, I think so too. Jesus, do you have any more tricks up your sleeve? Josie might have one or two more surprises left in her. Company first. It's hideous, isn't it? Looks like a friend of mine. Why do you call your dad Raeburn? I don't know, I guess we always kinda just have. Is he gonna be mad that I was here? No, he's not gonna be back for days. He teaches physics up at the college. And he doesn't like the commute so he just stays there during the week. I thought he homeschooled you. He does, just on the weekends. What about your mom? She died when I was a kid. No, it's fine. I never met her but Jack did. I kissed him. You were supposed to. Factoring polynomial equations. It just all seems like guesswork, like there's no process. You're scared, girl. You're so paralyzed with fear that you can't even make a simple deductive leap without a process to guide you. Let's examine a hypothetical. Say you were given a choice to study with me here at home or go to the idiot factory with all the other kids and be spoonfed theory like pureed vegetables. What do you choose? Huh? - I... - No, you wouldn't go. You wouldn't dare put yourself at the mercy of the outside world. But let's say that you were normal, okay? A normal girl with a normal upbringing. Doll houses, ballet, a mommy who baked cookies, never an unhappy day in your life, never an original thought in your skull. What do you choose then? I don't know. I guess I've never been that way. Well, thank God for that. Thinking about your new boyfriend? Stop. Oh shit, you are. Look at you. Are you blushing? No, I'm, no, no. No, I'm not in love with him, Jack. Yeah, but you like him. He's nice. He's an idiot. No, he's not an idiot. He's normal. Don't you ever wonder what it would be like to just be normal? You'd hate it. I mean, how high tech can the security system be? It's not. I just think it's more trouble than it's worth. Just think about it, it's all I'm saying. All right. He's so beautiful. No, I can't, I can't do this. No, I can't do this. I'm sorry. I really like you, Josie. You like this life but you don't even know me. You just like the package. Okay, you have got me totally wrong. I like coming here but, you know, with my friends, we go to parties and we go to the mall and we do things. And here, all we do is we sit around in this living room, we smoke pot with your brother. And I like him, I like Jack, but... It's you, Josie. I'm here for you. - Ah, ow! - Oh. Are you all right? You just hurt my hair here. - Did you hurt her? - Got my hair. Did you fucking - hurt my sister, huh? - No, no! - I didn't, she's fine, - Jack, Jack! - she's fine. - I'm fine, look at me. Let him go. I'm fine. He just caught my hair. It's fine. Go home. Josephine! Jack! Come in here. Have a drink. A toast to the two of you. You insane fucking children. Ah, you're the world's only hope. Sit down. Would you like to hear what your father did this week? Sure. How was the office, Daddy? Ghastly. I'm surrounded by idiots. Professor Ben Sorrells, rockstar scientist himself. He's up for tenure. And he'll get it, too. May his teeth fall out and his limbs wither one by one into uselessness. I thought Sorrells was harmless. Sorrells is a human plague who spends more time on his hair than he does his research. Not to worry, children. I have a plan. I have a man on the inside. Well, a woman. Margaret Revolt. She's enrolled in one of his classes. Sometimes I think that I should bring her up here. You, in particular, Josephine, you would benefit from knowing her. Oh, by all means bring her up. You'd know I love to meet her. Margaret would eat you alive, boy. I haven't had such a promising student since your mother, for all the good her promise did her. All those years under my careful tutelage, and what did she give the world? What is the grand end result? You. Vain, shallow, lazy, superficial. Put that goddamn thing down! I'm done with you, both of you. Get outta here. Get out. You sure you left it unlocked? I told you, I taped down the bolt. There. Okay. The camera should be off. It better be off. Hey, come on, hurry up. Remember you promised you wouldn't go crazy. Just a couple pills. Couple, couple dozen, really what's the difference? Jack. Jack, please. You sure you don't want any? I can't risk getting caught with any of that stuff. But thanks. Oh no, thank you. Admit it, being bad is fun. I'm not sure that's the word I'd use. Kevin, you won't have to do this again. Okay. Hey, Kev, relax, man. Let's have another drink? I'll be back. Okay. Enjoying yourself? Yes. Good. 'Cause this is the last night. What? Well, we don't need him anymore. Just tell him to take a hike. No. Yes. I like him, Jack. This was your idea, okay? All of this was your idea. It was my idea to milk him for the drugs. It was not my idea to sit upstairs by myself all night while he fucks my little sister on the family couch. Josie. One second. Did he tell you that he loves you? Hmm? Did you believe him? I'm the only person who's ever loved you. The only person in the entire world. You'll call me? I said I would, didn't I? Did you send him packing? Good girl. There's a gap between us and them. You can't bridge it. You're not like them. You're never gonna be. We're different. We're better. The annual faculty party is next Friday. It's the sort of ridiculous event that I normally try to avoid but this thing with Sorrells, I can't afford to be antisocial. You two will come as well. We'll put on a show. Happy, charming family. No way. You have somewhere else to be? Maybe I do. You do what you like. But if I don't see you at that party then I'd better not see you back here either. Do we understand each other? Go to hell. So well spoken. You sound like your mother. And we all know how she ended up. Decomposing in a pool of her own vomit, wasn't it? She counted on all the biological trinkets that you two see in the mirror to make her way for her. You'd find yourself as lost in the real world as she did. I've built you two a lovely little world where you won't ever become what she was, and all that I ask is that you show up at a party and play nice for my colleagues. Fuck you! Jack. Let's just get this over with. You must be Joseph's kids. Have we met? Not that you'd remember. You were only children. I'm Claire. My office is down the hall from your father's. Chemistry. I'm not sure if physicists should be allowed to breed without prior consent. But you two seemed to have turned out all right. No, we're painfully average. I'm unconvinced. We have to get back to our father. Excuse us. I'll join you. I should say hello. God, is everyone at this party gonna hit on us? Eugene, listen, what can possibly be left of quantum mechanics after being filtered through a brain raised on 30-second promotional spots? A pseudo revolution led by pseudo scientists whose only hypothesis is black holes are sexy. I'm not saying Ben is a brilliant theorist but he is a wonderful teacher. Being popular doesn't make you a wonderful teacher. Might make you prom king... You're only jealous because you didn't get to stand up on stage and wear the crown, Joseph. Don't worry, dear. I'll ask you to the next Sadie Hawkins. You see how Margaret Revolt looks at him? That's pathetic. I'm drunk and I'm stoned. Let's just go home. Gimme five minutes. Whoa. Oh, sorry about that. Sorry about that. It's okay. - Okay. - I am so sorry. It's okay. Are you okay? I'm fine, um... You're Ben Sorrells. Yes, I am. I'm Josie Raeburn. Oh, right, yes. I shoulda realized that. There's a family resemblance. You know, I've been hearing about you since I started teaching. Not from my father. No. From everybody else though. Every time his name comes up somebody always says, "Wait'll you meet his kids." Wait till you meet his kids to do what? Well, they just all, they say that you're really something, that you're good-looking and smart and all the things that we seem to really like people for these days. You know, your father, he's brilliant, you know. Not my... My father's a raging son-of-a-bitch. Excuse me. Are you okay? She's okay. Just steer clear of the shrimp. You all right? Wanna get some air? What's going on. What's wrong? She wasn't feeling good. I can handle it from here, Sorrells. In front of my colleagues, Josephine? I'm sorry. Who gave it to you? Was it Sorrells? What she didn't get herself I got for her. She's sick enough already. Oh, excellent, boy. You get your sister drunk, your 16-year-old sister drunk in public. Oh, as opposed to in private where it's okay? Well, take her if you want her. You've already ruined her. You're okay now. You're okay. I gotcha. I know you're in there, Raeburn. I can fucking smell you! Goddamn it, Raeburn, get out here! Raeburn! You fucking liar! Raeburn! Raeburn, I know you're in there. Get out here. Sorrells is at the door. Well then, perhaps we should let him in. Go get your father. I know he's in there. Something I can help you with? You know damn well why I'm here, Raeburn. Tell her to go inside. Why, will it destroy her good image of you to learn that you sleep with your students? I didn't sleep with Margaret Revolt and you know it. Look, Josephine, Benjamin just discovered that life is unfair. Aren't you glad you already know that? You unbelievable bastard. It's unfortunate. Perhaps in your next position you'll be more careful around your female students. You can't do this. You can't do this! Raeburn! Raeburn, you fucking liar. You call them and you tell them it's not true! Raeburn, goddamn it! In place of it. You have all my backing. I got something for you. Josephine, get down here now! You little ingrates. He went in my office. He took something that belongs to me. A letter. Did you help him? Did you help him? You stupid little shit! Goddamn idiot! Your brother just ruined me. He's... This is my house! You think you count for something here? You're nothing. You're just a couple of viruses that your mother left behind for me to deal with. Everything about you is a waste of my time. Please stop. Oh no, no, he's gone, he left. He's not coming back. You, you backed the wrong horse. Yeah, that's what you did. You backed the wrong... Then. All right. Hello? Josie, it's Ben Sorrells. Tell your father that Margaret Revolt is going to confess to the false report, to all of it. I can't do that. He'll kill me. Will you thank your brother for me? Jack's not here. He left. Why didn't you go with him? Josie. You know this isn't the way the world is. People acting like this. It doesn't matter. There's somebody coming to pick up the truck this week. I want it gone. It's been long enough. Your brother spent eight years too long with that woman. He will always try to charm the world out of its basket and he'll die angry because it doesn't work. Just like she did. Hey. I saw my room. Guess I'm outta the family for good now, huh? Where's the key to this? Why? Because I need money. It's mine, if you needed it, you should've taken it when you left. Trying to make me feel guilty isn't gonna get you anywhere. You think I wanted to leave you here? You must've because you did. Josie. I came back for you. Whose car is this? Becka. You'll meet her. You can go to sleep if you want. It's gonna take us a few hours to get to Erie. Josie. We're here. Becka should be home soon. Does your pop know you're here. It doesn't matter. Ignore me. I didn't mean nothin'. I never mean nothin'. Half the things that come out of my mouth you can't even listen to. Hear, hear. I'm kinda tired. Is there somewhere that I can lie down? Sure thing, sweetie. This here couch folds out. We'll just leave you be. Well, hey there, sweetie. What do you think of little ol' Becka? I think your accent's bullshit. I missed you. Okay. You didn't tell me this is a part of the plan. Look, we'll get out of here soon. I promise. In the meantime, this is a good setup. Becka rakes it in down at the strip club. How soon? Soon. We'll go somewhere good. Big city. Nobody to bother us. Nobody will know anything about us. I was just drifting and this was where I washed up. You gotta put your hands on. Let 'em. You're not playing it. So, I gotta go to the mall today. Figured you'd be tired but if you wanna come, you could... It's okay. I'm fine, thank you. We should hang out you and me and get to know each other. You can tell me all your brother's dirty little secrets. Are you sure you wanna know? You mean like careful what you wish for and all that? Smart girl. I was mostly kidding. I wasn't. I should be going. You weren't actually planning on her staying here, were you? Like staying staying. Come on, she's my sister. I'm not running a girls' home. She's taking up my entire living room. Couple of weeks, that's it. We better let her sit in front. Hey, gorgeous. Hey yourself. Did y'all have a nice night? Ah, usual. How was yours? All I wanna do is sleep for a hundred years. Sorry, you have something to say? No, I don't. Yeah. I bet. Hey, relax, she didn't do anything. No, no, of course she didn't. Hey, man. What's up. - How you doing? - Good, how are you doing? Good. Where's Becka? Ah, she's still in bed. I'll go get her up. Mark, my sister Josie. Bad news. She's tired. The two of us are just gonna hang out here. You two should go though. Jack. Go, Josie. There's no reason for you to sit around her all day. Fine. If you think she planned this, you're right. She told me about it yesterday. Somehow that doesn't brighten my mood. Well, I'm not saying it should but you can't really blame her. There she was, living with your brother who treats her good mostly. And then along comes a 16-year-old sister and all of a sudden he hardly gives her - the time of day anymore. - Okay, I'm 17. Not that that's any of your business. How old do you think Jack is anyway? Listen. I'm not saying I don't have opinions about your brother. I've got plenty of those. Come on. I didn't slog all the way out here just to sit in the car. So what did Becka say when she asked you to do this? Uh, exact words? "Mark, sweetie, Jack's weird little sister's visiting. "I need to get her outta my hair for a day or so. "You think you could entertain her?" She called me weird? She mighta called you a freak. I can't really remember. Hey. She said you're weird. So what? She's weird. I'm weird. Who fucking cares? You know I'm underage. Sorry. Becka told me you were 30. I have no updated information. So Jack says that you fence things. From time to time, I find homes for objects that have lost their way, yes. How does one get into that occupation? You're asking a lot of questions. Well, I am 30. I should know. Yeah, I guess you are, aren't you? You know something? What? I like you more than I like your brother. You are quite something, Josie Raeburn. Likewise, Mark last name unknown. Mmm hmm. Hello, ain't you two cute. See I was going for more adorable. We got a table. I gotta go to the bathroom. You okay? Yeah. You're cute when you're drunk. Did Mark make a move on you today? Did Becka make a move on you today? Well, I kept her happy. In case you haven't noticed, it's in our best interest to keep Becka happy. Yeah, don't I fucking know it. You didn't answer my question. Dance with me. Dance with me please, Jack. Jack, just dance with me. - Jack. - Hey, let's go. Why don't I get you home, okay? - Let's dance. - Come on, it's time for you to go home. Stop. Stop, all right? What's going on? I'm gonna take her home. She's pissed drunk. I don't wanna go home. I wanna stay. Okay, so stay. I'll see you back at the house. Well, why can't Mark take her? Mark's not taking my sister anywhere. Your sister. Your fucking sister. I didn't sign up for this shit. I'm tired of her. Her smug little looks always watching you like she's so much better than me. - Well, she's not. - Hey, relax, relax, - relax, relax. - You see the way she - wrapped all over Mark? - Chill out, okay? Your precious little sister? Just calm down. Don't you tell me to calm down. This is my house! No, oh oh. Hey! That's my brother! - Oh no! - Lay off! Ow, ow, ow, ow! Not going like this! You asshole. You're a snake. You think just because you're a good fuck you can walk all over me? You hitter! Get the fuck out! Get your stuff. Now, Josie. Can I get ya? Eggs, toast, two. Kinda eggs, kinda toast? Over hard, white. All righty. Here. This one. "Alphabet City studio sublet available immediately." Right, so, it's 350 a month, mattress included. You pay me in cash. No bullshit. You're late, you're out. We want it. I'm Luis. I'm the super, I live downstairs. Rent was due on the 1st, so you're kinda late. But it's the 11th. Yeah. Sorry. Ooh, fucking battery acid. We'll drink champagne next week. There is no next week, Josie. We're outta cash. You're the one who wanted to come here, Jack. Just say it. I just want you to fucking say it, okay? I ruined your life, didn't I? You were happy as a little princess with Daddy and then I waltzed right in and now you're living in squalor. Hmm? You fucking prima donna. You prima donna, you fucking... Fuck. Write happy birthday, Josie, from Becka. I don't think this is gonna work. You got a better idea? Okay, good. Keep back a little so it doesn't look like we're together. Next. Next. All right. Next. Just this. 2.50. Next. I gave you a 50. It was a five. No, I gave you a 50. It was a five, miss. You put it underneath your register. It has a birthday message from my aunt in purple ink. Shit. Sorry about that. - Thank you. - Next. Hmm? Rookie move. What? I saw the ink when you paid. You shouldn't have used purple. Too memorable. Just leave us alone, okay? Why should I? Be nice, Jo. Yeah, be nice, Jo. Jack, let's just go please. Jack. I'm Lily. My friend lives right up here. His parties are amazing. You'll just die when you see his place. Will I? Will I just die? I'll have him buzz us up. Maybe you could be a little bit less of a hostile bitch, huh? Maybe I should just go home and let you guys seal this whole deal without me. We're in. Let's go. Having a good time? Sure, yeah, whatever Oh good. "Sure whatever" is exactly the reaction I look for when I throw a party. I'm Carmichael. Josie. So how do you know Lily? We met her earlier today. Yeah, she does that. Meets people. And just for my own personal edification, how did she meet you? My brother and I were robbing a sandwich shop. Ah. Your brother. That makes more sense. Maris, she's his sister. Told you Lily had it handled. That's what Lilys do after all, handle things. What kind of things? Fabulous things. Like your brother. So what do you do? Nothing. You're one of us. Think I like her. Oh. Here, this is for dinner and whatever else you may need. Where is all this money coming from? Where do you think, sister of mine? Don't wait up. Bullshit. Bullshit. Oh, shit. Who is it? It's Josie. What's up? Do you got a light bulb? Yeah. Yeah, come on. The wiring's all fucked up. Oh, I'm sorry. What? Uh, I shouldn't talk like that around a lady. At least that's what my wife says anyway. No, it's fine. Don't worry about it. So you live with your brother? That's nice. You know, staying with family and all. He doesn't seem to like me very much. He doesn't like anybody. Yeah, well, some people are like that. What's going on? The wiring's all messed up. Luis is helping. Oh, don't bother. We don't need it. Maybe you don't. You're never here. You know, I'll just come back some other time. I left some things in my tool box anyway. Thank you so much. Not a problem at all. God, you're such an asshole sometimes. You know you're lucky I came in when I did. What, you think he was just helping out of the kindness of his heart? Yeah, he's the super. It's his job, Jack. Oh, you're so naive. Why do I even... Look, it doesn't matter. It really doesn't matter. We're outta here. How? We're moving in with Lily. Christ, Josie. What do you think I've been doing this entire time? I told Lily we couldn't afford our place and she jumped right on it. She said, "Move in here, darling." So I said, "I don't go anywhere without my sister." She said she feels sorry for you. She's a liar. I'm sure she is. Who cares. She's got a two-bedroom on the Upper West Side and the rent comes straight out of her trust fund. You think I can keep her on the line until we get tired of her? She's so high half the time she doesn't know whether she's coming or going. Or coming. You sound like me. Jack. Come here, come here, come here. Smaller sister. This is it. Okay? This is our chance. It's beautiful. I like the flowers. Lilies obviously. My florist delivers them every week. Santa Barbara, Madonna, science fiction. These are my favorites. Lilies of the valley. When I was a kid I had a cat that died from eating them. So sad. This will be like our own little slumber party. I bet you've never even been to a slumber party, have you? And Jack told me all about how your dad kept you locked up in that crazy old house all by yourself. So "Flowers in the Attic". Really. It's a wonder you two turned out as normal as you did. Oh, we're not that normal. Well, forgive me if I hold out a shred of hope for your sister. Her? She's the sick one. Way worse than me. Beloved sister. Did you sleep well? Is your brother not brilliant? Are you not blissfully happy? Blissfully. Good. Lily gets home at seven. We're all going out. She said to borrow something from her closet. Okay. Sorry. You're home early. Jack said that I could borrow something to wear. Yeah, it's fine, of course. I just had to get out of that office. My dad's on the board. What are they gonna do, fire me? You look great. When in doubt wear black. What can we do about that hair though? You have great hair if you knew what to do with it. And here. Can I get dressed now? Yeah, thank you. Well, well. You look as good as your brother. Guess Lily found her newest bit of window dressing. Window dressing? Take advantage of it while you can. She'll drop you when she gets bored like she always does. Oh, for fuck sake, Maris. Stop acting like a jilted girlfriend. It's so unattractive. I'm getting a drink. Please do. Don't mind her. She's always like this when Lily gets a new toy. Want a drink? How am I supposed to choose? I mean, look at you two. Honestly. Well, one of us is your sister. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm mmm mmm. You out to lunch with her again? Just some old friend from boarding school. You know what you are to her, right? The answer to her wildest fantasies. A new toy, a pet, the new piece of window dressing. Ah, let her think what she wants. She's on my hook, not the other way around. You better get going. She's waiting. Hi. God, Lily, what's on your arm? Nothing. I'm hungry, Jack. Can we just... No, we're going out, just wait. Well, I could just make us sandwiches... Goddamn it, Josie. I told you. She'll be home any minute. Just wait. She is two hours late. She got held up at work. Yeah, she's famous for her work ethic. Sorry I'm so late. Maris and I went to grab a quick drink and then it was like whoa, look at the time. No problem. Hmm, mmm, mmm, mmm. You smell like beer. I hate the smell of beer. I brought Thai food. I've been meaning to tell you I'm heading down to St. Barts for the long weekend. Okay. If I don't get out of the city every few months, I go nuts. But you guys can take care of everything, right? Like it was our own. Except it's not. Anyway. Carmichael is having a party tomorrow. I thought it'd be fun before I leave. Yeah. That's probably him right now. Hi. You okay? She was supposed to take me with her to St. Barts. Maybe she changed her mind. Fuck off! I want you to stick close to me tonight, okay? Stay where I can see you. I don't trust these people. Stay where you can see me? Why don't you stay - where I can see you? - Well, don't be a bitch right now, Josie. I'm not in the mood. You know what? Fuck you, fuck you very much. You look disappointingly sober. I am. Here. Jo, meet Joe. Greetings. Hi. So what I hear is that you're Lily Carter's new protege, huh? I, no, I just stay with her. She's, you know, whatever she is with my brother. I see, and what are you? She's seventeen. Is that so? Yeah. Well, then lets get you another one of those, huh? Where are we? Joe's place. You drank too much. You need to lie down. Oh God, Jack. Shh shh shh shh. Jack said it's okay. Jack. Shh. Jack? Jack. Where's the bathroom? To the left. That's Ingrid. That's my ferret. You wanna hold her? - No, I'm fine. - Come on, come on. No, she's cool. She's super sweet. You'll like her. Come here, baby. Mornin', mornin'. Here, here, just hold her for a second. No, I'm fine. Ah! - Ow, ow, ah! - No, no don't. No, no, you're freaking out. Ah ah ah. Don't freak out, don't freak out. You're gonna fucking hurt her! You fucking hurt her. Goddamn it. Get the fuck outta here, all right? Just get the fuck out. It's all right, baby, it's all right. You're okay. You're back. We tried to find you before you left. Lily said you went off with Carmichael. I just wanna take a bath. Can you leave me alone please? Did you? Go off with Carmichael? I just wanna take a bath. What happened to your hand? Same thing that happened to the rest of me. I told you. I told you not to leave my sight. Lily told me she loved me. Do you believe that shit? No. Me neither. You're the only one that's ever loved me. And I'm the only one that's ever loved you. That's all there is. That's all that matters. I wanna leave New York. Leave? Why? You really wanna give up everything we worked for just because of one bad night? Did you talk to Joe and Carmichael last night? Did you say anything to 'em? No, I never even met Joe. Look, I get it was a bad night. But you act like... I mean, it's not like you never had sex before. Just forget about it. Put it out of your mind. It sucked, it's over, move on. Josie! Come here. There you are. Where have you been, sleepy head? Nowhere. I was wondering when you'd be up. Josie, come here. Let me see you. What's this? I just cut it on a can. It was stupid. Well, it looks infected. You should see a doctor. Josie's fine, aren't you, Josie? Yeah. There's a first aid kit in my bathroom. Would you get it, Jack? And the bruises? Did Jack do it? No. Look, I know what he can be like. Okay, I know how he can get. Yeah, but unlike you, I don't get off on it. You're smarter than that, Josie. You got your wish. Hmm? Why, what's happening? She said she decided when she was away. Wants us out by Friday. You always hated her, didn't you? I always hated her too. From the moment I saw her. I have a treat. If we don't all set off with hangovers tomorrow, I'll consider my life a failure. What should we drink to? You tell me. To the future. And then the cab driver charged me some absurd amount of money and she paid for it. I mean, the girl's a complete disaster. - She even... - Would you two shut the fuck up? So very grouchy. I said shut the fuck up! Fuck you both. Oh, darling, you already have. I'm right, aren't I? Oh, I knew it. I knew it! Carmichael had his suspicions and I mean, I knew, of course I knew, but I didn't know! Ooh, I'm, I'm not judging. It's kind of romantic. I mean, maybe a little sick, but who isn't a little sick sometimes? Were you kids when you started? Oh my God. It's like one of those British novels and the kids are always fucking each other. I think I need to go to the doctor. Lily Carter? Let's get you comfortable. Hey, I gotta go and take care of some things, okay? I'll be by later. Go to sleep. Dr. Gable, Dr. Gable. Chris Corda, 6-3-1-9. Chris Corda, 6-3-1-9. Dr. Hinkle. We have to take the bus. Every other way leaves a trail. I don't wanna leave a trail, okay? We gotta slip away. What do you think? Have you been taking too many of Lily's pills? No, no, no, no, no, not too many. I just need to stay awake and think. We're gonna get away with it, Josie. We are. You and me. You and me. Okay. Okay, yeah, okay. Okay. Dr. Stanley Gilbert, please call Emergency. I see the florist came. Has the phone been doing that a lot? Afraid so. I talked to your old friend Carmichael. I told him she headed up to Maine last minute. And then I stopped answering it. Her parents left a message on the machine. That's not good. Oh we'll, it's not bad. I mean, her parents live in Florida. I mean, it'll be weeks before they figure out she's not in Maine. I got some wine. I figured we'd go all out, one last night before we hit the road. And then what? And then we find some other Lily. You. You never trust me. We have this conversation every time. You always have to know where we're going and what we're doing. But haven't we always come out all right in the end? We're not at the end of this yet, Jack. Smaller sister. You're always so serious. We're free as birds. With Lily's ATM card we have all the money we could possibly want. That ATM card is traceable, Jack, okay? We might as well carry her body to the police station and tell them what we did. Mmm hmm hmm hmm. All right, first of all, it's not what we did. It's what I did. And second of all, I did it for you. I told Lily, if she wanted to watch me fuck another girl, I'd do it but not you. Why not? Because we belong to each other in a way that nobody else will ever understand and I refuse to share that. I refuse to share you. Do you know how lucky we are to have each other? We'll always be together. Always. Well then, I better start cooking then. Why don't you go turn on some music? Coming right up. God, I hate all this white. When you and I get our own place, let's not have any white in it at all, okay? None. Not even white sheets. You still feeling bad? Yeah. I'm sick. Oh, what's wrong? Everything. My heart is racing. Maybe you took too many of Lily's pills. Food musta been bad. I can hardly see. Food poisoning will only last till the morning. Hmm? You think I'll live? Doubtful. Josie. Hey. When is Raeburn coming home? We're in New York, Jack. We're at Lily's. Is she here? Lily's dead. Josie. I'm here. Hey, I'm here. Knew it was you. Don't leave me. I won't. I won't. It's gonna be okay. We'll go somewhere new, just the two of us. Like a private island. And we'll be happy. You and me. I love you. I love you so much. Hey. Oh, oh. Oh.
