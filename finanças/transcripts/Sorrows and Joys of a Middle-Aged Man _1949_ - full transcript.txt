SORROWS AND JOYS OF A MIDDLE-AGED MAN STARRING: Han Fei, Li Huanqing, Shen Yang, Zhu Jiachen, Shi Hui DOP: Huang Shaofen SOUND: Shen Yimin DIRECTED BY: Hu Sang "Just as Heaven loves to hide its intentions in the dark grasses, "So love between people only becomes clear... "when it is too late." - Li Yishan, poet Father, can we play over there? All right. Just don't wander off. YUAN MINGHUI WIFE OF CHEN SHAOCHANG Stop crying. Let's go home. Zhiquan? Oh, Principal, you're here too? Mr Chen. Minhua, don't cry. What an obedient child, weeping over her mother. My children seem to have forgotten about their mother. It's like they think they're here on a picnic. See? Look how happy they are! Are they all at your school? Yes. And, Minhua, what about you? Her current school isn't very good. I'll send her to yours next semester. Fine, she's welcome. I'm just worried she won't meet your standard. So please could you look out for her? Of course. But she's a clever girl. Yes, clever... but also cries too much. Look at you. Your eyes are all swollen. I brought her here without her stepmother's knowledge. You'd better not tell her, eh? Why are you so scared of your wife? She's very capricious and intolerant. How does she treat Minhua? She was all right at first, but when she had her own baby, everything changed. But enough about this. Come over to my place later. I haven't drunk with you for a long time. So let's make an evening of it. All right. Let me take the children home first. Jianzhong! Jianzhong! Mr Chen, sorry that we don't have much food. It's fine, Mrs Liu. But have a drink with me. I don't drink. Zhiquan, you can drink for me. - Have another drink, Mr Chen. - I've had enough. Let's eat. All right. I'll get the food. Here, Shaochang, let's have a toast. Big brother, how do I do this? I'm busy! Don't make me beg. For the university entrance exams, don't you know? If you won't help, then don't. I'll ask cousin. - Aunt! - Hello. Cousin, how do I do this? Look... - Is your father back yet? - No. When he's back, tell him I want to talk. - Principal! - Hey, Old Ma! - You're late back! - I had dinner with a friend. There'll be a wedding dinner soon too! Oh, just go upstairs. You'll know about it soon! Father! You're back! Auntie's looking for you! Hey! Where's your walking stick? Ah, I must have left it at Zhiquan's place. - Uncle. - Hello. You're looking for me, sister-in-law? I want to show you something. Who is it? Someone Old Ma downstairs wanted me to show to you. He says she's a good person, and if you want, he'll act as your matchmaker. Oh, that explains what he just said. Well, what do you think? I have no plans to marry. Don't get me wrong, but how can someone your age not have a wife? My wife's been dead for six years... and I'm doing just fine, aren't I? It's not just about you. Someone has to take care of your three children! The children are actually the main reason why I don't want another wife. How's that? No child wants a stepmother. I had dinner at Liu Zhiquan's place, and his new wife has no interest in his daughter. So you're really not planning to marry again? If I wanted to, it'll at least be after the children are grown up. If you wait till then you'll be an old man! And when I'm old, I won't need to get married! Oh, yes... It was payday at the school today. Here's your and Xiaochuan's allowance. We already live and eat under your roof, and every month you give us money too... Oh, it's nothing. That's why I hope Xiaochuan will find a job soon, so we won't have to rely on you forever. Hey, things are different now. Children these days should focus on their education. Father, I want to go to bed. Look at you... Wives usually put the children to bed, but you have to do it yourself. I'm used to it. Let's go. Ma, This woman looks quite pretty. Why doesn't uncle want her? What do you know about it! Jianying, time for bed. I don't want to! Is this your diary for today? "Today is Tomb-Sweeping Day. Father took us tomb-sweeping. "After that we went home. When we got home we had some food. "After eating we did our homework. "After homework we went to sleep." What are you doing? Keeping records? All right, bedtime for you. Come on. You've grown so big, Father can barely carry you! Jianzhong, you should sleep too. Look at you... you're yawning. Father, the graduation examinations have been rescheduled to earlier. I'm very worried. I'm afraid I won't pass. Well, you can't just cram it in one day. It's getting late, so get to bed, hmm? Who are you looking for? I'm looking for the Principal. He's giving a speech at the moment. Just wait here. I'll get him for you. I've already spoken a lot, and there are many fun activities after this. So, I'll end with a story. I started this school more than ten years ago. I still remember how few students we had back then. Perhaps you might not believe it, but we started with only twelve students. Twelve! But that did not deter us, and we moved forward step by step. And today, we have more than three hundred students, and have built quite a reputation for ourselves. So, no matter what we do in life, we must be persistent, and we must be prudent. And so, I leave these two words, "persistence" and "prudence", to the graduating students today. Thank you. Mr Chen! Minhua, what are you doing here? Are you enrolling? No. We're moving to Hankou tomorrow. Hankou? Father's company is sending him there. He told me to tell you. So you're all moving? Mr Chen, here's your walking stick. Oh, you've brought it! Come here, Minhua. I have some cakes here. Come and have some. The rats must have found it. - There are rats here? - Mm. We can't eat these. I'll ask them to buy some. It's all right. I have to go back. Already? Stepmother said I have to be back in half an hour. But you only just got here! It's stopped working again. It never works for long. This watch is older than you are! Mr Chen, I really have to go now. My brother will wake up soon. All right, I'll see you out. - What's wrong? - My hand hurts. Your stepmother beat you again? Xiaochuan! Once you've put your stuff down, come to my room for roast chestnuts. Let's play chess afterwards. Mother - Hello, sir. Is your graduation over now? This is my certificate. I got first place, and this was my prize. Oh? You get prizes now? Mother, look. - Xiaochuan, where are you going? - To Uncle Chen. Come here. Xiaochuan... You're going to start work tomorrow. Work? Mother, I don't want to work. I want to study! There is no other way... Xiaochuan, they almost finished these without you. I saved some for you. Here. Uncle, I have to start work tomorrow. Work? - Where? - At a department store. I really have to thank Old Ma for helping my son find this position. He's still a child. Let him have an education. We can find a way to deal with his tuition fees together. These days there's not much use for higher learning. Well, at least let him finish High School. It's not just High School students... even University students have trouble putting food on the table these days. Hey cousin! Big brother wants to play chess with you! Xiaochuan... go on. Come on! Quickly. I've been waiting for ages! Sister, boil some water. - Okay. - I can do it! Like hell you can! Jianzhong... I want to give this to you. What for? I don't need it anymore. I have to start work tomorrow. Work?? Where are you going to work? At a department store. A department store?? Not exactly a great job! Like you'll do any better! Of course I will! I have a plan. When I grow up, I'm going to work at a bank! AnPing Bank, February Salary Mr Chen Jianzhong - Hey, Liu! - Huh? This is the first salary I've ever received. I feel so strange. I can't quite believe I can make money. That's how I felt on my first payday too. But by the second time, you get used to it! MANAGER'S OFFICE Hey, who are they? The boss's daughters. Pretty, aren't they? Absolutely! Mr Chen, the boss wants you. Mr Feng. Mr Chen, I'm looking for a favour from you. Of course. My two daughters aren't doing all that well in university. So I wanted to ask whether you could tutor them? If you have the time... I appreciate the offer, sir. But I'm no scholar either. Oh please, don't be modest. Of all our recent new staff, you've done the best by far. That's why I'm asking you. If you really think that highly of me, I'll give it a try. Great. We'll start tomorrow. After we finish work tomorrow I'll take you to my place. All right. So what did the boss want? He asked me to tutor his daughters after work. - Then there's your chance! - What chance? To get closer to the two girls! Yeah! Don't talk nonsense! What chance would a poor boy like me have with them? You don't know that! You've just got to be confident and go for it! Stop joking. But really, here's some advice. To get closer to people like that, it's all about your image. Take your tie, for example. That won't do. You should change it. Jianping, have some duck stomach. Someone's in a good mood! Today was my first payday! What's that? A tie. Nice! Is it for me? No, it's mine. Where's sister? In Auntie's room. Auntie, have some duck stomach. My teeth are no good. But leave some for Xiaochuan! Here, Jianying. Big brother, feeling rich today? It's my first payday today. Oh! You want to treat us, and you think duck stomach will do?? All right, I'll take you to the cinema tomorrow. Cinema? I'll come too. Cousin, you're back. Xiaochuan, Jianzhong has got this for you. Oh? Thank you. I forgot that I could have gone to your store for a tie. I can give you a 20% discount. Jianzhong, you must learn how to spend wisely now. Don't spend it all at once. When your father comes back, you should give your salary to him. That would give him some joy. But Father already has money. You don't understand. As parents, being able to use our children's money... even if it's just a small amount, will give great happiness. I still remember when Xiaochuan started working. When he gave me his first salary, I... I cried. Mother is like that, even when she's happy, she'll cry. Father is back. - Uncle. - Hello. You're all back? Father, have some of this. It's from big brother! - Father. - Hmm. I... I got paid today. I... I'll give it to you. Shaochang, just take it. It would mean a lot to him. Keep it for yourself. I don't need it. Oh, wait. I'll just take one bill. I'll buy them something nice tomorrow. Whom? Your old teachers! For what they did for help you. Have some treats, everyone! They're from Jianzhong! He's already making money for himself! Mr He, you should have some extra. You were his class teacher. Thank you, thank you! - Here. - Thank you, thank you. Principal? There's a Miss Liu looking for you. - Miss Liu? - I told her to wait in your office. Old Wang, you have some too! The Principal is really happy today! Mr He, why aren't you eating anything? I'm taking it home for my children. Well, that's a little cheap! I barely make enough for our rice, much less treats like this. One of these days I'm going to switch jobs, and earn more. Mr Chen. Don't you recognise me? I'm Minhua. Minhua? Ahh, Minhua! It's been more than ten years. You've grown so tall! When did you come back to Shanghai? It's been less than a month. How's your father? He died. Huh? When? Last year. Who would have thought! Anyway, Minhua, please have a seat. Oh, have some candy. Thank you. So it's just you and your stepmother at home now? And my younger brother. Oh, yes. Your younger brother too. Are you still in school? No, I graduated high school. - Mr Chen... - Hmm? I... I was hoping... that you'd help me find a job. These days... work is hard to find, but if you'd be willing to work as a teacher here, I might be able to help. That's great! I studied teaching in Hankou. But a teacher's pay really isn't great. I don't mind. I'll be happy with whatever you pay me. Then... can you start tomorrow? My house is far from here. Can I live at the school? Sure. Just bring your things here tomorrow. I was hoping I could stay here from today. Today? Something's not right. What's going on? You can tell me. I'm not going home. Did... something happen with your stepmother? I've burned my bridges with her. Minhua, don't get me wrong, but running away like this isn't right. You don't understand! After my father died she has treated me even worse than before! I have to run errands for her all the time. And recently she's tried to make herself my matchmaker. She wants to marry me off... to some old man in his 50s or 60s! Is that right?! You want to marry her to an old 50- or 60-something?! Mr Chen, don't listen to her nonsense. This man is a good person! Just a bit older, that's all. There's nothing wrong with an older man! This man could be her father! How can you want her to be with him?? This fellow... It's just heartless! What? You're calling me heartless? Who are you to our family? What is our family business to you? Of course I care. I'm her father's old friend. Then you should know our financial situation. Her father is dead, and left us with nothing. So you'll just solve your problems by forcing her into marriage? I can't take care of her forever! Stepmother, that won't be necessary. I found a job. You're a woman. Why do you want to work? From tomorrow, I'll be a teacher at Mr Chen's school. A teacher? You just said you can't take care of her forever, and now you're not happy that she has a job? Such a good man waiting for you, but you want to work for low pay! Well, if you want to work, then don't come back! You'll see what happens! Minhua, let's go. Miss Liu... can I trouble you for a moment? What is it? Something's come up tomorrow afternoon. Can you help cover my classes? No problem! I'm free tomorrow anyway. - Really sorry about this. - Don't mention it! Ms. Liu is so nice, always kind and helpful. Yes, she's been here three months and I've never seen her lose her temper. Come on, you two, no need for flattery. Miss Liu, the Principal is asking for you. That girl will make a great wife for a lucky man someday. So why haven't you asked her? I'm from a poor family. I barely make enough for myself. Marriage is out of the question! - 16, 17, 18, 19... ...20. Will you be late again? Go. - Is she from your class? - Yes. She's late almost every day. You should handle this sort of thing. I have asked her about it. She said that her mother just had a new baby, and there's no one to help. She has to do all the household chores before coming to school. That's why she's late. I think we can be understanding about this. - Hmm. So you allow this? - Yes. Anyway, I don't approve of caning. You don't approve of caning? Caning students' palms is an outdated punishment. Well, I've caned many palms over the decades. Nobody ever said it wasn't right. DICTIONARY Your dictionary's in pieces. It's because of the rats. They're a huge problem. Then why not get a cat? I remember when I was young and came here, you offered me some cake, there were rats here then too! Yes. That day I thought you were coming for us to teach you. I never thought you'd come here to do the teaching yourself! Time passes so fast... Oh, let me tell you some news. My eldest son is about to be married. Oh? Who's the bride? The daughter of his boss at the bank. But I don't know how I feel about his marrying this kind of rich girl. Rich girls aren't necessarily bad people! - Have you met her yet? - No, but I will tonight. Her father invited me to dinner. No wonder you're wearing new clothes! I should probably get going. Stopped again. What time is it? - 5 o'clock. - 5 o'clock? Is that your same old watch? Yes. I've had it for so long I've grown attached to it, I can't bring myself to replace it. - Mr Chen. - Hmm? You should probably shave before going there tonight. - Can I borrow a little money? - Of course. I always forget my wallet when I put on new clothes. What?! - Who broke the window? - He did! All right, all right. Go on. Off you go. Newsboy! You go back first. I'll come with my father later. I'm worried he might not like me. I promise you that he will! I heard that your father prefers plain girls, so today I styled my hair like this. You've thought of everything! Jianzhong? Jianzhong! - Who's calling you? - No one, no one. Get in. Jianzhong! Someone is calling you! Jianzhong! Didn't you hear me calling you? Uh... Lijun, let me introduce you. This is my father. This is Miss Feng. - Mr Chen. - Ahh... You head back first. - See you later then, Mr Chen. - Yes, yes, good, good. - Father. - Huh? - What's wrong with you? - What do you mean? If you want to shave, why don't you go to a barbershop? Who does it in the street?? It's cheaper. What's the problem? She saw you. I'm sure she'll tell her father. She'll say that you're unrefined. So I'm unrefined? If you feel that way, I won't go out to dinner. But fine. Don't ask me to officiate at your wedding! Officiants, please stamp the document. Bride and groom, please turn to the guests! Bow to greet the guests! I now pronounce you man and wife! Jianzhong! You owe us big time for your marriage! Don't forget who encouraged you to get her! So how are you planning to thank us? All right. I'll toast you. - The bride should drink too. - She doesn't drink. That's not good enough! She must drink. But I really don't drink! If she won't drink, then neither will we! I'll drink for sister-in-law. You don't have the right to! Ohh, I get it. You want to flatter her so she'll be your matchmaker. Is that it? Isn't that right, Miss Feng? What's this? It's the newlyweds whom you should be teasing. How did we become the focus? Jianzhong, I think you'll have to drink for me. All right! Look at this! He's going to be under his wife's thumb! Mrs Chen! - I can't stand it. I'm going back. - What's wrong? I know I'm only a handmaid, but you brought me here with you. The conditions here are terrible. I have to sleep on the floor! They don't even provide a bed! All right, don't worry. I'll talk to father-in-law. To be honest, miss, we deserve better than this! No telephone, no refrigerator, no flushing toilet! Not even a gas... a gas cooking range! What kind of life is that? The guests are finally gone. Mrs Yang, you can go to bed now. Hey, let me ask you. - Where does she sleep? - Under the stairs, as you know. Yes, but you make her sleep on the floor, without even a bed. A bed?? Give her a bed right now, otherwise she'll quit. I'll buy her a bed tomorrow. Mrs Yang, it's just for one night. No! I brought her here with me. She must be treated properly. All right, all right. I'll sort it out now. - Father. - Mm. You're not in bed yet? I... - What's wrong? - Er... It's about the handmaid who is now here. She wants a bed. But it's late now, and all the shops are closed. So what'll you do? I... I wanted to ask whether sister could lend hers. Lend my bed to your servant? It's just for one night. Come, on! Please! "Come on" indeed! Just think... we've already "lent" you most of the house! Even Auntie moved out! This is all for you. What more do you want?! All right. But keep your voice down! What if they hear you? You should be ashamed even to ask! Hey, Jianping! Jianping! Don't bother him. He's already asleep. Here, just take mine. Father, I... - I can't let you do that! - It's fine! One night on the floor is no problem. I was used to sleeping on the floor as a child. Here, take it. Where did you get that from? My father lent me his. I feel terrible! Terrible? He's an old man, and he's sleeping on the floor! Fine... it's my fault then! I've made you a bad son. Hey, no need for tears! This is the happiest day of our lives. There's nothing to cry about! I know... living here feels like a comedown. But, Lijun, I am not useless. Your father thinks highly of me. So in a couple years... once I have money and status, I'll buy a huge mansion for us, Then we won't have to live like this anymore, hmm? Come on, come on... stop crying, hmm? Longlong! Don't ride here. Play over there. Sister-in-law, why did you bring all that old junk back here? Just throw it away! But I think father might still want it. That's just like him! Where's big brother? Is he not back yet? Not yet. And I've been working like a dog. What about my younger brother? Him? He's with a guest upstairs. - Who? - My younger sister is visiting. Sister-in-law, we're off to the cinema. Going to the cinema? You should help your in-laws! It's fine. If anything he'll just make me even busier! That's right. So let's go then. Those two have done nothing but fall in love with each other. Father is not back yet? Eh? He'd usually be back by now. - Everyone is out? - Mm. Someone gave us a cat. She's adorable. And should take care of our rat problem. - This can her bed. - All right. It's pretty late. Why don't you go back home? - We're moving house today. - Moving? Then you really have to go back! They already packed everything. They wouldn't let me help at all. Your new house must be very well-kept. I don't really like that area. It's too far from here. Doesn't your son have a car now? You can ask him to drive you here. He can drive his car. I'd rather take the trams. - You're back. - Yes. Longlong, say hello to Grandpa! - Grandpa! - Hello, Longlong! Father, your bedroom is all furnished! - I'll take you up to show you. - All right. How did you two come home together? I saw him at the trams on my way home, so I just drove him back. This room is your bedroom. What do you think? It's very big! I've arranged everything for you. You only have to do your books. This bed is unusable! Unusable? What's wrong with it? I didn't say there's anything wrong with it, but... it's too soft. I can't sleep on that! All the beds sister-in-law bought are like this. Then I'll just sleep on the floor. Don't worry. I have an idea. I brought your old cot with me. I'll ask them to change it for you. Good. Yes, that'll work. Lijun, from now on we can invite our guests to our home. Yes. Next month is your father's 50th birthday. We should have a party. Hosting the party here suits everyone... all apart from the old man, that is. His school is just too far from here. I was thinking... we should buy him a rickshaw. A rickshaw? What for? Think about it. Him squeezing into those trams every day... that doesn't make me look great. Silly! Do you know how much a rickshaw costs? Especially compared to how much he earns at his school? - Then what should I do? - I've already told you. You should just tell him to retire. What's wrong with being a respectable Master at home? I don't think he would want to leave. Well then, find a way to persuade him. Yes! I'll do it right now! - Father. - Hmm? I... I want to discuss something with you. We all think you shouldn't go to the school anymore. It's too far, and inconvenient for you. I take the trams. Exactly! They're always crammed to the brim. I really can't bear to see you trying to squeeze in. Just think... if any of our friends or family saw you, they'd criticise us for not looking after you! Well, I don't blame you, so it's fine. You should think about it from my side. I'm the assistant manager at the bank now. People are starting to know me. What? Am I embarrassing you? That's not what I mean. I'm just saying you should relax more at home. You've already reached the time to be an Old Master, a man of leisure. Old Master, Old Master... Who's calling me "Old Master"? I don't feel old. I'm still perfectly healthy and fit for my age! You've misunderstood me. Listen carefully. Whether one is old or not has nothing to do with one's physical well-being. It's about one's status in society. Take you for example. People already think you're retired, an Old Master, so that's the road you should walk. Otherwise, people will view you negatively. - Negatively? - Yes. Perhaps I am getting old. But I have no idea what an Old Master does! That's fine. You can learn. Learn? Mm. Then I'll learn. Father. Your old cot is here. I don't want to change it. Take it back. Father, what's going on? Now you don't want it any more? Yes. I have to be an Old Master now. - Father has decided to retire. - Really? RETIREMENT CEREMONY OF PRINCIPAL CHEN Now, on behalf of the school's staff and students... I give this gift to Principal Chen. We wish Principal Chen all the best for the future. I now invite Principal Chen to give some parting words. My dear staff... and dear young ones... I... I really don't know what to say. Let me tell you a story. When I started this school... there were only a few students. Perhaps you might not believe it... but in our first year, we only had twelve students. Twelve. But today... I see so many students in front of me. That gives me the greatest comfort in my life. Today... for you all to gather so warmly to send me off... and to give me such a precious gift... I can never repay your generosity. But I have already agreed with the School Council... the perfect choice to be your next principal. Why isn't your father out yet? - He's just finishing a few things. - Then let's go on ahead. No, let's wait a moment. Let me think whether there's anything else I need to tell you... Er... the rice shop didn't send enough rice yesterday. We were short 20 pounds. So deduct that when he comes for payment tomorrow. 20 pounds. Got it. Also, the medicine cabinet is running low on gauze and cotton. Gauze and cotton. I'll buy those tomorrow. - Do you mind leaving that here? - Hmm? I wanted to ask for that photograph. What could you want that for? You handed the school to me. It's a very big responsibility. I'm sure I'll face many difficulties. Your photograph will give me encouragement. Well, I feel totally confident with things in your hands. I'm just worried... About what? Well, you'll marry eventually. Women usually stop working once they're married. I'll never give up on my career. And, anyway... I won't get married. Why not? No reason. Everyone settles down eventually. I believe that everyone should get married. Then why haven't you? I? I already have grandchildren! Why would I marry? Minhua, your situation is not the same as mine. But I do care about you very much. You care about me only as an elder. What's wrong? Are you angry? Father, can we go now? Go on. I'll take it from here. Oh, I've just remembered. Mr He's wife just had a baby. Make sure to advance them some money. And the cat. Tell Wang not to forget to buy her some fish every day. Fish for cat. Let's go. You shouldn't bother Miss Liu with these unimportant things! All right! Let's go, let's go, let's go! Where are the keys I just gave you? Give them to me. This drawer's a bit stiff... Look... you can't lock it normally. You have to... do it like this. Got it? Yes. Let me try. What's he still doing in there? This Old Master is going to be trouble. I think he's really a bit senile. All right. Let's go. Think clearly... is there anything else you've forgotten? No. Let's go. So, Minhua... time to say goodbye... Goodbye. HAPPY BIRTHDAY! - Where's the Master? - Upstairs. - We wish to pay our respects. - Thank you, thank you. Come in and sit. Jianzhong! Liu! Great timing! Play for me. I've got to head out. Where? The radio station asked me to give a lecture. - A lecture? - Yes. Brother-in-law has become quite a celebrity! He's busy all day long! Sir, the station is calling for you again. Yes. Tell them I'll be there soon. Right, I really have to go. Liu, play for me. Auntie, you're here! Jianzhong, you're going out? I'm so busy. I'll be back in a bit. Auntie! Cousin! - Where's Uncle? - He's upstairs. - I want to see him. - Sure, I'll take you up. Father, Auntie's here! Hello, sister. Uncle, happy birthday! All right, all right. Enough, enough! Xiaochuan has brought you two thermal tops. Xiaochuan, you giving me presents too? Everything is so expensive these days! No, they were very cheap! These tops were given to us employees by the department store. They were displayed in the window, so they're a bit dusty. Just wash them and they'll be fine. Xiaochuan, you haven't changed! Cousin, it's busy downstairs. Let's go down. Sure. Come, sister. Sit with me. Why don't you go downstairs? What would I do down there? They're just playing mahjong. But don't you get lonely up here by yourself? No, I'm used to it. All I do is eat and sleep anyway. I'm bored out of my mind. Bored? Everyone's talking about how fortunate you are. Jianzhong and the others are so good to you, but you're still not happy! I didn't say they haven't been good to me. but you know me, that's just how I am. I can't bear having nothing to do. What do you mean nothing to do? Apart from anything else, you still have two unmarried children! Isn't planning their marriages taking all your time? Sister, you're really old-fashioned! Children these days want to find love their own way. They don't want our help. - Easy for you to say! - Eh? I have to deal with Xiaochuan. I have to arrange things for him. He's a bit naive in these matters. He will never find a wife! Xiaochuan is decent fellow. I was thinking... Xiaochuan and your Jianying would make a good couple. It's just that our family is... a bit poor. That doesn't matter! All that matters is whether they want to or not! Cousin-in-law... play with us. No, no, no... I don't understand this game! - Let's listen to the radio. - Sure! Big brother's giving a lecture on the radio. - About what? - The title is "The Youth of Today". "X O R T. "United Radio. "Broadcast No. 1800. "Telephone number: 67347. "Address: 63 Phoenix Road, Shanghai. "Dear listeners, this next programme is hosted by local esteemed banker, "Mr Chen Jianzhong, who'll be giving a lecture. "Mr Chen's topic is: 'Cultivating the Youth of Today.' "We shall now begin." Sister-in-law, can you turn the volume up? "Dear listeners! "Cultivating the youth of today, "certainly sounds like a wide topic. "But it is actually very simple. "I believe that all young people... "...should have some principles that they must follow. "Number one: "Absolutely no gambling! "For it is an immorality of the most blatant kind! "For example, whatever kind of gambling, "be it mahjong, cards, or dominoes... I don't know anything about any of it. "Some of you may laugh at me for being from the countryside, "but I was able to get to where I am today, "because I did not indulge in these vices. "In any case, I absolutely detest gambling. "Gambling affects both one's financial health and one's mental health, "with the most serious of consequences." Hear that? What a load of nonsense! Social climbers these days are all like my son, making a career out of lying! Sister, let's talk about something else. So... tell me... Xiaochuan and Jianying... what do you think? You should ask them themselves. If they want to be together, then of course I'll agree. Xiaochuan will obviously agree. It's just a question of Jianying. If I ask her as her father, it might be a bit awkward. What if you ask her? All right. - Old Master. - Huh? We need some extra chairs for the mahjong tables. Can I take these? All right. Auntie, sister-in-law is asking for you to play some games with her. She said you can keep what you win, but she'll cover you if you lose. I can't let her do that! Go on! They're all waiting for you! Well, go on then! "Mr Chen's speech has concluded. "Currently, the time in Shanghai is 6:15 PM. "Make sure to set your time correctly." Principal Shaochang - Retirement Gift from Ziqiang Elementary School Minhua. Mr Chen! What are you doing here? My house is full of visitors. They're all busy playing mahjong. I was bored, so I crept out. You haven't been back since you retired! Yes. But I've been wanting to. How is everyone? Fine! The office still looks the same, just some extra flowers. A student gave them to me. His father's a florist. Minhua, I'm famished. Is there anything I can eat here? - I'll cook you some congee. - Fine, fine. Put a book underneath. Oh, you rebound the dictionary? Well... women certainly are thorough! Unfortunately we don't have much. Only pickled vegetables. Pretty good! So, what news here at the school recently? No news. Oh, there is one thing. Your cat ran away. Ran away? The past couple of months we've only been able to cook congee, The cat couldn't eat it, so she ran away. Sounds like a career in education is more and more difficult... But look at me, wasting your food! Oh, you're welcome to it. Have as much as you like! Hey, slow down! You've broken into a sweat. This isn't from eating. It's from walking here just now. - You walked here? - Mm. Why didn't you come by car? Well... I bet you don't have any money on you. How did you know? These are new clothes. Pretty perceptive! You could have asked your family to drive you. They don't know I've come here! Won't they be worried? Where on Earth can he have gone? So late and he's still not back! Do you think something has happened? Maybe we should call the police and ask? The Master is back! What? Has something happened? How can you even ask? Where have you been? I was at the school. Then why didn't you tell us? We were worried sick! I can take care of myself! So we were wrong to be concerned? Jianzhong! No need to talk further. He's back now. We can all relax now. We're still in the middle of our game. Let's go and finish it. Mr Feng! - I have something important to discuss. - What is it? Let's talk inside. Everything's fine. But the school I set up... has some financial difficulties. It's barely keeping afloat. So I'm hoping you can donate some funds. But... If you can help, of course I'll invite you be our Chairman. Chairman?? I couldn't accept that! - No, no... but why not? - I? It has a lot of potential! You wouldn't be wasting your money. Let me tell you a story. When I started the school... we had barely any students. Only twelve, to be exact. But now, we have more than six hundred! All right. I'll do what I can. I'll send some funds tomorrow. Jianzhong, let's go down and play some cards now. - You go first. I'll come in a moment. - Good, good. He's nice to you. But you should have talked to me before asking him for money. I made him Chairman. What's the problem? Chairman, Chairman! When people get old, they don't realise that they've become annoying. It's easy to talk. That story you just told... I've heard it hundreds of times. Always the same. "In the beginning... we had only twelve students, "and now we have..." blah-blah-blah. Why do you keep going on about that? I... Brother, they're all waiting for you. Father, what did you two argue about again? It's nothing! Jianying! Come here. Did Auntie say anything to you earlier? How do you feel about your cousin? Go on. No need to be shy. Just a pity he's not well educated, having to start working after elementary school. I feel that as long as he's willing to learn, that's not a problem. Just because one is well educated doesn't mean one is wise. So you've made up your mind! Everyone's gone now. You can go upstairs. You go ahead. I'll come in a bit. What's wrong? Seems there's something on your mind? Lijun, I'm just thinking... Just now, about the funds your father's donating, maybe I was a bit too harsh on the old man. - So you are filial after all! - Ach, that's not what I mean. I mean that someone like that old man is already behind the times. I can't talk seriously with him. Every time I try, it goes nowhere. Don't you agree? I get it. You want to maintain your image now. Yes. And it's his birthday today too. Your father's a simple man. Just say some nice words to him, and everything will be fine. Or maybe you can send him a present. I've got it. Remember that land I bought last month? I have an idea. Think, the old man is already getting quite advanced in age, and we're not using that land. So why not give it to him as his final resting place? Final resting place? Not a bad idea. But I tell you, you can't take this lightly. Otherwise, your descendants will be cursed. You think I don't know that? Obviously I'll check the feng shui there first, then make a decision. Grandpa! Longlong, give this to Grandpa. Longlong, what is this? Tell Grandpa to guess! - Is it something to eat or use? - You won't be able to guess! I won't? Then I guess I won't waste time trying! Tomb of Master Chen Shaochang What's the meaning of this? I bought some land. The feng shui is very good. We thought it'd make a good resting place for you. We'll rebury mother to be with you on your centennial. This year it's your golden jubilee, and we wanted to give you something special. You two really think of everything... already planning my burial. Of course it's not like that. This is just planning ahead. It's going to happen one day. There's nothing to be scared of. I'm not scared of death. What I'm afraid of is waiting for death. If we had known this would upset you, we wouldn't have shown you. Longlong, come on. Jianzhong! Don't go. I need to talk to you. Seriously, I don't want just to wait for death to come for me. Is your bank hiring? Give me something to do. It doesn't matter what. Just don't lock me in here as an "Old Master". That's not what I want at all! If you're bored you can go on a trip. Or you can try gardening... keeping fish or birds, studying scripture... stamp collecting... whatever you want! He told me to try gardening, keeping fish, go on a vacation... and even read scripture! I've tried everything. But I just don't feel happy. Your brother just won't let me work! He's just like that. Oh dear, you've made Grandpa's hat dirty! Take this instead. Children are such a handful. Jianying... since you got married I've had no one to talk to. Father, hold this for me. Everyone at home looks down on me. Even the servants! You shouldn't eat that! Here, have a lolly. Your younger brother is the same too. He's always either watching a film or dancing with Lijun's sister these days. Also... your older brother... Jianying, I'm talking to you! I'm listening! Greetings, esteemed Old Master! We don't have much for you to eat... but please have a roasted sweet potato! Well, thank you, my dear lady! - Jianying, have one too. - Oh, leave it for Xiaochuan. - When he comes back we'll buy more. - I'm really too full! These two are really a happy couple. Father, now you're flattering me again! To be honest, I came today because I have something important to discuss with Xiaochuan. What do you want with Xiaochuan? I want him to help find me something to do. Oh, come on. Your eldest is a big figure now. If he can't help you, what use can Xiaochuan possibly be? Besides, the economy isn't good. Young people can barely scrape by. At your age... why pick a fight with them? Yes. Why fight with the youth? Father, everyone thinks you're so fortunate. So why do you still want to work? I'm leaving. I won't wait for Xiaochuan. - Oh? Uncle, you're here? - Hello, Xiaochuan. - You're just leaving? - I'll see you again in a few days. - What's this? - Mother asked me to buy it. Tomorrow it's Tomb-Sweeping day. Look at me! I'm so preoccupied, I even forgot about that! YUAN MINGHUI WIFE OF CHEN SHAOCHANG Mr Chen! Minhua? Hello, Mr Chen. What brings you here today? As you know... it's Tomb-Sweeping Day. Why isn't your family here? They don't have time. I remember... many years ago on Tomb-Sweeping Day. You were only this high, sitting here, crying your heart out. I wiped away your tears. Do you remember? How could I forget? You left this walking stick in my house, and then I brought it back to you. Time certainly does fly. Do I look much older? Not really. But it seems there's something in your mind. It's nothing. All I do now is eat and sleep, sleep and eat. People say I'm fortunate, but really I'm miserable. You can chat with your friends. I don't really have any friends. I used to chat with my daughter, but she has changed since her marriage, worrying about her child all day. She has no time for her father. You could find some work. I've suggested that to Jianzhong many times. But he doesn't want me to. He says we're not struggling, so if I go to work it would just embarrass him. But you should be doing something. For someone at your stage, with all that wisdom and experience, you are in the most mature part of your life. It'd be a real shame just to throw that away. They already think I'm old, almost ready for the grave! They've even prepared my final resting place! I always think that we Chinese go straight from youth to old age, with no middle-age. But really the most precious time of all is middle-age. So you think I'm middle-aged, not old? Of course! It's the best time for work! At home they won't let me do anything! I do mind about that, but I know it's not healthy. Let me tell you a story... Early one morning, I was relaxing in the sunlight by the door. The newspaperman came. I just glanced through it. After a while, I saw... the cook bringing back the shopping. I was bored, so I started to talk to him. I went over, and saw his basket. I asked, "How much was the chicken?" He told me the price. I asked about the fish, and he gave the price. I asked about the vegetables. Again, the price. Then I asked: "How much was this egg?" and he started to become unhappy. I didn't notice, to my regret! Then I asked: "What about these small fish?" That's where he lost his temper, shouting at me. He said: "Old Master Chen! "Why are you asking so much? Worried about my spending? "I'm using Young Master Chen's money, not yours, so it's none of your business!" I knew he had misunderstood me, so I explained to him. I said I had no problem with his spending. I was making conversation. But he didn't get it. He carried on shouting, even louder. That man had a short fuse. Then my son and daughter-in-law came down. The cook dumped the shopping on the floor, and said he quit. My son immediately calmed him down. You should have seen my son. He didn't scold him - he comforted him! In the evening... I was reading, and my son came to my room. He said to me, "Father, what's wrong with you? "You are the Master. Why would you argue with these people? "Nowadays you can't offend these people." So I said, "But even if he quits, would we all go hungry? Well, after he complained, what else could I have said? I understand. Your natural curiosity was too great, but it didn't have a proper outlet, so it accidentally created this misunderstanding. That's why I said you should find something meaningful to do. It's not easy these days. Why don't you come back to the school? You helped donate a lot of money, but what we really need is people. I've thought about that too. But I can do anything else. I just can't go back to the school. Why? Is it because your son won't let you? - Well, that's one reason. - What else is there? Mostly I'm concerned about this. Look... my retirement is engraved here. After being given such a gift, how can I just go back? Is that all? That's a child's logic! You're calling me a child? Of course! You're saying you can't come back because of that. Isn't that pretty childish? Everyone calls me Old Master, but here you are calling me a child! But really, come to the school tomorrow. You can be Principal again. All right? No, no, no! You're the Principal. I'll just be a teacher. Then it's a deal. You can't go back on it. Of course! Why would I go back on it? What if your family won't let you come? Don't worry! I don't need to tell them! Old Master Chen! Where are you going so early? I'm... I'm just going for a walk in the park. Old Master Chen must be up to something, leaving so early every day. - Yes? - Follow him, and see where he's going! All right. ZIQIANG ELEMENTARY SCHOOL Father. Where do you go every morning? I... I... I go to the park. - You're going to the school, right? - No, I'm not. Why would you hide it from to me? Someone has already told me. What's this? Why are you doing this? I tell you, a man without work has no joy. He should have daily responsibilities. You've given that school a life's worth of responsibility, not to mention the money you've donated. If it wasn't to give you face, why would my father-in-law agree to be Chairman? He gives money, I give time. We give what we have. Regardless, you have to think about me. If people get to know that my father is still working as teacher, that's just completely unacceptable! All this talk, but all you care about is your image. Jianzhong, if it embarrasses you so much, then don't call me your father! All right, all right. Don't be angry. We can find a way to work it out. - I'll tell you something funny! - What? Jianzhong found out I was teaching. Yesterday evening he confronted me, and I admitted it. But there's nothing he can do about it. So you don't have to keep it secret anymore? So... that's why I'm wearing these old clothes. Right, can you persuade Mr Sun? I've been trying all day. - What's wrong? - He wants to leave. Leave? To where? - Singapore. - Why? A relation opened a rubber plantation and asked me for help. But our school needs you! How could you leave us? I feel there's no future in being a primary school teacher. I always wanted to change job. I've just been waiting for an opportunity. This is such a good opportunity. I simply can't let it go. Mr Sun, look at Mr Chen. He could relax at home as an Old Master. But he'd rather come here to work. You're younger than he is, but you don't want to work so hard? My situation isn't the same as his. I am younger, so I can't just stay here forever. Right? It seems you've really made up your mind, so I won't press it anymore. When are you leaving? In the next few days. I'll bring you my resignation letter tomorrow. It's not necessary. No. And also... There's something else I want to talk to you about. Don't be nervous to talk to your father. Father... I... What is it? You feel awkward? Shall I say it for you? He wants to marry my younger sister, and came to see what you think. That's all it is! As long as you're both willing, then I'll support it. See? Isn't he easy? I told you he would agree! I've never thought much about my children's marriages. But Jianping still can't support himself so... I'd say don't rush it. That's not a problem. His older brother will help him. Then I have no objections. See? You can take it easy now. We'll leave you in peace. Sir, there's a Mr Sun to see you. Mr Sun...? Ah, Mr Sun! I'll be right down. - Mr Chen. - Please sit, sit. When are you leaving? It's very difficult to get boat tickets. It'll be a few more days. Mr Chen, I came to ask a favour. I was thinking... No need to be awkward. Just ask. Actually, I don't really want to leave... because... it's about Miss Liu... I've really fallen for her. I've never dared to tell her. Why not? She's not a difficult person. Yes, she's very kind. But she never lets anyone get too close to her. I think... she must like someone else. I don't think so. I've never heard her talk about anyone. Well, I could be wrong. You've come to ask me to be matchmaker? Yes! But do you really think it's right that I discuss such things with her? I don't think there's anyone better! Mr Chen, I really need your help. I'm hoping to get an answer today. All right. I'll go to ask her now. Then I'll wait for you here. - Hello, Mr Chen! - Hello, Mr Chen! What are you doing here? It's Sunday today! I need to talk to you. What's all this? They want me to take them on a picnic tomorrow. Picnic? Why don't you come with us? The weather's so good! Please come, Teacher Chen! I... - Come! Come! - All right, all right. Now, please leave us a moment. I need to talk to the Principal. What's the matter? You look so serious. - Mr Sun has just been to see me. - What did he want? - He... asked me to tell you something. - Tell me what? He wants to marry you. Well, that's unexpected! He said that as just a poor teacher, he never dared to ask you about this. But now that he has a better job, he can offer you a more stable life. - Seems he's thought of everything. - What do you think of him? I think... he's pretty selfish. How so? He sees teaching elementary school as a worthless job, and he wants to leave at the first opportunity. It really is a hard job nowadays. One can barely make a living. Who'd want to do that forever? You can't blame him for that. I know. This is a systemic problem, I can't blame just one person. But marriage is completely different. Well, I feel... he might have switched career because of you. Obviously he wouldn't want you to live a hard life. Then... do you think I should accept his proposal? I did think he was sincere. He really does like you. And besides, you should get married eventually. What's wrong? Minhua... Minhua? I knew it! You're just like my mother-in-law. You're only thinking about getting me married! What? You're comparing me to her? To be honest, I don't want you to marry him. You don't? When he asked me to come here... I felt a strange sense of jealousy. Jealousy? Then why are you trying to persuade me to marry him? Well, it's not as if I could marry you! Why can't you? I've always hoped you'd feel that way. No, no... this is completely out of the question! Why? You just feel bad for me. You think I'm bored and lonely. If you married me, it'd just be out of pity! Pity? I never thought of you as deserving pity. You... don't pity me? But what's worth loving about me? There are many things to love! You just don't know it. - You're back! - I am! - So you told her? - I did! What did she say? She wants... to marry me! - Marry you? - Yes... I never thought... I also never thought this could happen! I really didn't know. Please forgive me. No, I must thank you. It's you who has helped me. No need to see me out. Mr Zhao. - Where's Young Mister Chen? - Playing mahjong. - Tell him to come upstairs. - Right. Young Mister Chen, Old Master Chen is calling for you. I'll come in a moment. Do you think father wants to speak to him... because of us? Maybe he does object to our marrying. No, he doesn't object. We only asked for his approval to give him face. We don't need him to pay for it. So it's really none of his business. That's right. Jianzhong, I need to talk to you about a wedding. Don't worry about my brother's wedding. Just leave it all to me. - I'm talking about myself. - You... you...? Who are you marrying? Liu Minhua. Liu Minhua?! Honestly! He gets worse and worse! Maybe talk of your marriage gave him ideas? What did you say to him? Of course I objected. We talked for ages, but he's very stubborn. Once they're married, what if they have children? When the old man croaks, there'll be no one to care for them. The widow and the children's expenses will all be on you. That's why we have to find a way to stop this. Jianping, what do you think? I? Well, father never interfered with our wedding plans. So, now that he wants to get married, I think we also shouldn't interfere. Ah... You don't want to interfere? So it's just me who has to sort this out? Of course, when the old guy dies all the problems will come to me, It won't be on you. So you can afford to be the nice guy. All right! His and your weddings... I'll keep out of both! But don't come to me when you need help! Brother-in-law, no need to get so angry. Brother-in-law... you and Master Chen marrying on the same day would be quite convenient. If you're both grooms on the same day, wouldn't that be great? Sister-in-law, really! You're making fun of him. Elder brother, I was wrong. I'll help you deal with this. I'll follow you. We'll all oppose father. We'll all - Where are you going?! - To the school. - You really want to marry Minhua? Aren't you worried it'll look ridiculous? - Ridiculous? - Everyone will think so! You've had plenty of time to marry. Why didn't you do it ten years ago? Ten years ago... you were all too young. It was because of you all that I didn't re-marry. What? Ten years ago I didn't marry... and now it's my fault? No need to say anything else. If you really want to marry, I just have three things to say. One: none of us will attend the wedding. When the time comes, don't complain that we're rude. Two: you must find your own place to live. We will not let Minhua set foot in this house. We don't want this stepmother! Three: my father-in-law is the school Chairman. So now, I represent my father-in-law, and in his name as Chairman... I remove Minhua as school Principal! I don't think he's going to let it go. I have another idea. I'll talk to Minhua's stepmother. Mrs. Liu? What are you doing here? Not so fast! I need to talk to you! This plan to marry Minhua, is it true or not? Yes, it is. You dare admit it? All right, let me ask you... A little while ago, when I wanted her to marry that other man, you said that he was too old... old enough to be her father. You called me heartless. That's what you said. Then what about you? Aren't you old enough to be her father? And you want to marry her? You think you're not heartless?! - I... - I get it! You invited her to teach here, because you already had your eyes on her! You're her father's old friend! What would he say? - I... - You're a beast in human form! A beast in human form?? Stepmother, I'm grown up now. I can handle my own marriage. Silly girl! Haven't I always looked out for you? I've already decided to marry him, so you don't need to think any further. It'll serve you right! I shan't bother any more. You're not thinking straight. Look at him, at his age. He already has one foot in the grave! And you want to marry him? You! Your troubles are ahead of you! She said I already have one foot in the grave. Perhaps I am too old. She is not educated. You can't listen to someone like her! It's not just her. My entire family is against it. They said that they won't attend the ceremony. And you think it's shameful that they won't come? You're wrong. The shame is on them themselves. Also... they'll make us find our own home. They won't let you in the house. Even if they invited me, I wouldn't go. I wouldn't want to live with them. Also... they'll use the Chairman to remove you as Principal. That's nothing! We can just set up our own school. "Set up our own school"? It's not as easy as that. This school is my life's work... You cannot hold onto the old so tightly. You must let it go if you want to create something new. I don't understand! Why are they so cruel to me? Why do they treat my wanting to marry as a sin! I suppose... the world belongs to the young people now. You're wrong again. You think they represent the youth? Of course not! They just think you're past your prime. Principal, are we leaving or not? Yes, yes, yes... we should head off. - You go. I don't feel like going. - Why not? I'm not in the mood. Oh, don't be like that! Come on, come on... Teacher Chen, can you referee our tug-of-war match? Sure, sure, sure. All right, ready? Now... one... two... three Come on! Use your strength! Pull! Pull! Come on! All right. I'll take on all four of you! Oh! - Are you hurt? - No, no, no. - Sit down and rest over there. - All right, all right. - Teacher Chen, are you all right? - Yes, yes. You go and have fun now. - Why did you exert yourself so much? - I don't know! Please give me a banana. Minhua? I suddenly feel a lot younger. But no one said you were old... I finally understand life's preciousness. Everything I see... the clouds, the river, the trees, the dirt... they're all the same, because they're all alive. Little fellow, come here. Come on! Give him a banana. Here. Take it! Have you ever been to school? Is there a school here? Someone should open a school in this place, don't you think? What the hell? Why did you throw a banana peel at me?! I'm sorry. It was me. Never mind, never mind. - Is this a garden? - No, it's a cemetery. "Chen Cemetery"... Same surname as me! - Can we have a look? - Of course, of course. This place is really quite nice. "Master Chen Shaochang... Place of Eternal Rest." So this is the place. You know this man? What is this? The resting place Jianzhong gave me. You're... you're Old Master Chen?! That's great, Old Master! Just another month and it'll be done! Thank goodness you're building it early. Prices these days are going up and up. You're very fortunate! I think your stepmother was right. I do really have one foot in the grave. You were in such a good mood earlier. Don't be like this! I have no home for us when we're married, but after I'm dead I certainly have a place to rest. Indeed. We Chinese certainly are a strange people. We treat death so importantly, but forget how to live. - That's it! - What? We don't have a home, right? We can build here, and live here instead! Master Chen, what are you talking about? We'll build a house here. We have the materials for it! You must be joking, Master! You can't build a house in a cemetery! The living are more important than the dead. With the extra space, we can set up a school here! Exactly! - Let's go. - Yes. I'll be back in a few days. ONE YEAR LATER CHEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL INAUGURAL OPENING TODAY Dear students... today is the first day of school for all of us. But let me tell you all a story first. Hold on, I'll be right back. - Still crying? - It's all right. - Is it feeding time? - We've just done that. Mimi! Mimi! Mimi... Mimi! The school opens today, but I can't get out of bed yet. I'm so worried! No need! You'll be up again and teaching in a couple of weeks. We were supposed to do this together, but now you're doing it all yourself. Well, I suppose I should deduct your salary then! - You must be exhausted today. - Oh, not at all! I feel like my life has just begun, just like our child. You should get back. Your students are waiting for you! Yes, yes, yes... What was I saying? You wanted to tell us a story! Yes, a story! A long time ago, I started a school. There were only a few students when we started. If I told you, you might not believe it. Try and guess, in the first year, how many students did we have? Only twelve students! Twelve! But now, that school has more than one thousand students. So for this school, while we are also starting small... Of course... let me count! One, two, three, four, five, six... ...seven, eight, nine, ten... ...eleven... ...twelve! What a coincidence! Twelve as well! But I believe, in a few years... this small school of ours will prosper!
