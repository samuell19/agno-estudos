(thrilling music) - [Dr. Gray] Might be a tumor. - You think it could be a teratoma? - I don't know, I don't think so. I've never seen anything like this. Look, just bring the subject in and we'll cut it open. See what's growing inside of it. (thrilling music) (cats meowing) (thrilling music) (cat screeching) God, get it, get it. Paul, get the cat! Get him! (dramatic music) Code red, code red. ST-618 has escaped. Use extreme precaution. Radiation security. Radiation security. (alarm blaring) (cat screeching) (cat screeching) (gun cocking) (cat meowing) (gun firing) (cat screeching) (creature growling) (men screaming) (static whizzing) (cat screeching) - [Dispatcher] Security assistance. Security assistance needed to hallway 1079. - The building's secure. Now, Paul, no matter what happens we can't let that cat out of here. - Dr. Gray, you saw what just happened at that stairwell. - Just shut up about that. All right, now we gotta kill that cat. Give me your gun. Give me your gun! (cat meowing) (cat meowing) (cat meowing) (cat screeching) (creature growling) (gun firing) Nice, kitty. Here, kitty, kitty. Nice, kitty. Nice, kitty. (Dr. Gray screams) (creature growls) (Dr. Gray groans) (cat meowing) (traffic buzzing) - No, don't even think about it. We cannot afford this hotel. - Yes, we can. - Oh, let's think about this. I mean, we've done it before, right? Oh! - Sorry about that. - Oh, yeah! There we go. Yeah, it's cool, it's cool. Yeah, take it easy. Look, honey we tried every other place in town, okay. Let's just go inside and sit down in the lobby for five minutes. What do you say, huh? I mean, my feet are killing me. Why did you let me wear these shoes this morning? - You wanted to wear those shoes. You know they make your legs look good. You told me that. - And now they do, see? Woo hoo! - [Lester] Do you have any reservations here? - Well, not exactly, but. - I thought so. - My uncle is a stockholder. - I'm sorry, but you cannot stay in this lobby without reservations. - [Bobbie] Well, I was just wondering if perhaps. - Look, I'm sorry. - Five minutes maybe. - But you'll have to find somewhere else to go. Now, please, get out, get out. - Lester. It's okay, they're with me. - Oh, I'm so sorry. I am really sorry, Mr. Graham. There must have been some misunderstanding. You see, I thought they were all part of the college stop. - Okay. (Suzanne sighs) Sorry about that. Hotel personnel get a little sensitive during spring break week. - Yeah. - You girls don't have a room, do you? - No. - Yes. - No. - Yes. - (laughs) It's okay, I understand. I've been there. I might be able to help you with a place to stay. I was just about to go in and have some dinner. Why don't you join me and we can talk about it? - I don't think that would really-- - Well, it's just something to eat, Suzanne. - Yeah, it's a good restaurant. Just something to eat, Suzanne. No strings attached. - I just don't think we're dressed for dinner. - It'll be all right, trust me. - Man, I'm starving. - You can leave your bags here. Come on. (thrilling music) - Wait for us. (orchestral music) - Jesus, do you believe this guy? We've gotta go now. - Ladies, my business associate, Mike Harvey. - How do you do? - We've got a meeting, remember? - Bobbie, Suzanne, please accept my apologies. My associate is correct. I do have some business to take care of. - Oh, but you haven't had your dessert yet. - All the more for you. And you are coming to the party, right? Starts about midnight on my yacht? - Oh, yeah. - I'll send the limo back here to get you. Should be fun, lots of interesting people. Bob, see that the ladies get what they want. See you in a little while. - Bye bye, Mr. Graham. - Oh, please, call me Walter. - Good night, Walter. - You know, you really got no class at all, you know that? You couldn't give me 10 minutes more? - You wanna miss this appointment for a couple of bimbos? - He'll Wait! - You can't be certain, Walt. He's scared, he's desperate. Desperate men do desperate things. (Walter sucks teeth) (thrilling music) (seagulls cawing) (knowing) (fire crackling) - [Darryl] I don't know, Walter. I'm telling you, I just don't know. - Now, Darryl, it's gonna be all right, trust me. We've all made a lot of money from our little understanding. - It's coming unglued. Look what the commissioner's doing already. - [Albert] You sure it won't be too hot in here, Mr. Graham? - Uh, probably. Turn on the air conditioning. I love to look at a fire, don't you? - Oh, sure, looks nice. - Here, drink this, Perkins, and stop being such a pussy. - You got no right to talk to me like that. - Calm down. Mr. Harvey didn't mean anything. - Yeah, I'm sorry. - You guys don't know what it's like to fight the SEC. You got the big bucks to pay the fines and get off. I don't, I'm just small potatoes. I'll go to jail. You know they're really cracking down. I mean, look at Olsky, Levine and all the rest. You know, I don't have the money to just-- - All right, now just take a look right in there, Darryl. There is no problem with money. (Walter laughs) Anything you need. - $1 million in cold hard cash. Another one in that. Another one in that. - On no, and all my family and my wife. - I think we're getting way ahead of ourselves here. Have you been contacted yet by the boys from the SEC? - Not yet. There've been inquiries at the firm, a lot of talk. We just got too greedy. - Are you sure you haven't talked to anybody yet? - No, I haven't. Of course, I won't. You guys know that. I mean, come on, you've got nothing to fear. I would stand to lose as much as you guys, even more. Walter, you can trust me. - I know I can. Relax, Darryl, it's all right. Come on, come with me. Let me show you around the yacht. Albert. - [Albert] Yes, sir. - [Walter] Turn on this spot light, make it all bubbly, I'd love that. Now bear with me on this, Darryl. I started this little story because you were saying that I could trust you and I had nothing to fear from you. - That's right, Walter, you've got nothing to fear from me. You either, Mike, you can trust me. I swear, I swear. - It's called blackmail. You've heard the term? - Of course. - Mike, you're getting ahead of my story! Anyway, you see the point is that I learned about blackmail a long time ago, What I learned was never put yourself in a position where some idiot can blackmail you. Where someone has power over you. Like being able to make a deal with the SEC, tell them something they want to know. Turn State's evidence for a lighter sentence, huh? - Walter, Walter, I wouldn't do that. I wouldn't do that. Oh, please, Walter. Come on, Mike. Mike, come on, what are you doing? Oh, please, Walter. - There's only one way to be certain. - But I'll do whatever you want. I'll do whatever you want. (dramatic music) (water splashing) (Albert shivers) - Mike, look at Albert. Look at him. He's gonna be sick. (Albert shivers) - You okay, Albert? - I'm just outta breath. - Oh, and, Albert, the party is in about an hour and a half so after you've cleaned up this mess here, get everything ready. Will you, please? (Albert groans) (thrilling music) - Come here, Kitty, that's it. Drink some milk. That's a good kitty. There you go. There you go. Good kitty. Yeah, that feels better. Good kitty. - Hey you got some change for the cigarette machine? - Yeah. (man grunts) Hey! (man groans) - All right, give me the keys! - [Man] How much you get? - [Thief] Enough. (thief laughs) (cat meowing) (glass breaking) (man groans) (man screams) (glass breaking) (clattering) (upbeat music) (seagulls cawing) - Fort Lauderdale at spring break. No place like it in the world, agree? - No contest. (Lance chuckles) (hands slapping) All right, let's go down to the beach, check out the action. - My friend, the beach is for riff raff. Look, if you wanna find a classy chick you go to the marina where all the money is. Come on, everybody knows that. - Oh yeah, of course. (chuckles) Hey, you're right again, Corey. Check these two out. Help me, I'm in love! - [Corey] Ooh, and they seem to be coming our way. - Oh man, what are we gonna do? - Try to look bored. Do what I do. - Hi, you mind if we sit down? - Of course, be our guest. - We just wanted to sit for some coffee. You sure you don't mind? - Hey, you guys! - Oh, no. - Hello, ladies. - [Bobbie] Hi. - We're never gonna find a place to stay. This whole town's book solid. - Not now, Hedgeworth, we're busy. - Last night we met this guy, Walter Graham. He's got this great big yacht-- - Now wait, are you talking about Wall Street Walter? I mean, this guy is the best arbitrageur in the world. I mean, he's made more millions on Wall Street than anybody. - Must be the same guy. You should see this boat. - Well, anyways, we're supposed to set sail this morning on a cruise for the Caribbean. Be gone a couple days, maybe more. Why don't you guys come with us? - You can help us handle this guy if he gets outta hand. - Besides, it'll be fun. I hear the Caribbean's perfect this time of year for swimming in the raw. - I am really gonna meet Walter Graham. (cat meowing) - All right, thank you. Damn it, the girls aren't on board. - Good, let's get the hell outta here before they come back. - You just don't get it, do you? Don't you think two pretty girls on a cruise makes a good cover, in case somebody should be snooping around? You gotta use your brain, Mike. - I know what you want 'em for and it has nothing to do with cover. - We need the girls on board. - Young broads are a pain in the ass. Old broads are a pain in the ass. (upbeat music) - You guys really don't know who Walter Graham is? - Oh, sure, I've heard of him. So he's made a lotta money, so what? - So what, are you? This guy has been on the cover of Forbes Magazine twice. - He's just a man, horny like every other guy. - Yeah, well, he ain't the only horny one. (laughing) (cat meowing) - Shh, shh, shh! You guys here that? (cat meowing) (woman gasps) Oh, look, the poor thing. Hey. - He looks starved. Oh, come here. (cat meowing) Oh. - Genetic laboratory. This must be a lab animal. Musta gotten away. - You mean, they're gonna cut it up and experiment on it? - No, not necessarily, but sometimes it is vital to-- - No way, not with this cat. I'm taking my little baby with me. (cat meowing) (upbeat music) - I don't know guys, I feel a little sick, I never realized I'd actually get sea sick. - Come on, look, Lance. Look at the size of that boat out there. Now, you are not gonna get sick on a luxury yacht like that, come on. Come on. - Come on. Come to Mama. We'll make you feel real good. There you go. You okay? Oh my god. (retching) (liquid splashing) (dramatic music) (seagulls cawing) - So how is my captain this morning? - I'd be a lot better if we hadn't lost an entire crew. - You mean, you still haven't replaced them? - Walter, do you know what time it is? Besides, if you didn't treat them like slaves we wouldn't have to replace them. - Okay, so I got a little drunk and mouthed off to the crew. I apologize, but it is my boat. - So it is. - And if you don't like that honey, you're free to leave anytime. - [Rachel] And let you ruin her before I have a chance to get her back? (Walter chuckles) - Your old man couldn't make a go of this boat. What makes you think you can? - Leave my father out of this. - Rachel, if you really want damn the boat back, all you have to do is ask. I can be a very generous man with people who just treat me right. - Walter, you pay me to run this boat, nothing else. (Walter sucks teeth) (Walter sighs) - Well, think about it, okay? Just think about it. - Don't count on it. (thrilling music) - [Walter] What's going on here, Mike? - Mr. Graham, I was just telling your associate here that I'm a great admirer of yours. You are the greatest. (Walter laughs) - Well, thank you, but I'm sorry. You're gonna have to leave anyway. And how appropriate, here comes the shuttle right now. (waves crashing) - Graham? Graham? Graham. Graham. - Albert, what? - The SEC, uh. I just got word the SEC has got a warrant to search the boat. - We've gotta get outta here now. - I'm afraid we've had a change in plans and we're gonna be leaving immediately so I'm sorry but you're all gonna have to go back to the pier on that shuttle boat. Captain! Take us out to sea right now, please. - Without a crew? You must be joking. - You guys still wanna go on this cruise or not? - I'd do anything, I just don't wanna barf again. - Look, Walter, you've got three able-bodied men here plus Suzanne and I can help. That's crewmen that you don't even have to pay. Besides, we'll all have some fun! What do you say? - Albert, take these three sailors and raise the anchor and bring up the gang plank. Mike, start the engines. All right, everybody. Come on, let's move it! (cat meowing) Suzanne, that cat goes back with the shuttle. - No, it's mine! - You know, I heard a cat on board a ship is supposed to be good luck, Mr. Graham. - Listen, kid, if you really wanna go on this little cruise with the rest of us, the first thing you've gotta learn is that this is my yacht. That means I am in charge and I don't like cats, so the cat goes. Sorry, Suzanne. - Oh, please, Walter. I promise this darling little kitty won't be any trouble. Please, I'll take care of it. You won't be sorry, I promise. - Okay, keep the damn thing, but you owe me one, Suzanne, and I never forget that. (Suzanne laughs) - Ooh, check this place out. Whoa ho, it must have been some party, huh? (Lancelaughs) - It was. (cat meowing) How you doing now, better? - Yeah, I'm okay. Corey was right, being on a boat this big. I'm okay. - I told you, nobody gets sick on yachts. - Oh, gross, what a mess. - Yeah, the hell with the mess. Do you know, somebody could actually live on this boat permanent like? - Yeah, well, Mr. Graham loves to party. - Well, then he can't be all that bad, huh? (Lancelaughs) (pop music on the radio) Here, pussy, have some food! (cat meowing) - Oh. H9)'- - Hey, where you going, sexy? That cat's not going anywhere. So why don't we have some fun, huh? What do you say we partake of a little party? - Yeah, let's party! (laughs) ♪ Joy, any time of day (laughing) - Damn, I certainly feel sorry for the sucker who has to clean this place up. - Self pity is not a good habit to get into, kid. We had a deal about crewing this place, remember? - Sure thing, Mr. Graham. We were just a little hungry. - I don't like you. I don't like punk kids who think the world owes them a living. What that means is, is despite what duties that the captain has for you, I'm assigning some specific duties right now. You're the cook. You're the busboy and the dishwasher. You're the maid. (Suzanne chuckles) - Yeah, well you can go take a flying-- - Whoa, just a minute there. Now, he's right, Mr. Graham is the boss. - Now, who's side are you on? - Well, nobody's side. We have work to do and we're gonna do it, right? As a matter of fact, we'll throw a party tonight in your honor. Now, Walter, you just leave all the petty stuff to me. I'm sure you've got much more important matters to attend to. Okay, guys, we can get this place cleaned up in no time, huh? - Now, you must be the smart one. The smart ones always know who's running the show. - I hate punks like those guys! - Mike, the only important thing here is that we get this boat to Grand Cayman and get our money out of that bank before it really hits the fan! It's time we throw in our cards, take our winnings and get the hell outta town! Now if these punks can help us run this boat then we need them! - All right, just keep them the hell away from me. - All right! Did you put all the cash in the safe? - Yeah. - You gotta loosen up a bit, man. You realize how much money we're gonna be taking out of that bank! You're gonna be richer than your wildest dreams! - What if the account is frozen when we get there? - Stop worrying, today's only Friday. We're there first thing Monday morning. We get the cash and we go buy a country in South America. Live a little, live a little! You're a rich man! (dramatic music) (upbeat music) (cat meowing) (cat meowing) - They're all talking about a storm. - What do you want me to do, Rachel? What am I supposed to do here? - Oh, just keep that needle heading like I showed you. - You gotta get one of those kids up here. I don't know how to-- - Albert! You're taking us off course. - Well, I don't. (dramatic music) (cat meowing) (creature growling) - Just keep the needle pointed like I showed you. You understand? And keep your hands off everything but the wheel, all right? Go ahead, take the wheel. Relax. It'll be fine. - Great spring break in Lauderdale, huh, Corey? - Yeah, you just wait 'til I get a chance to talk to Walter Graham. - Oh, and in the meantime, we do dishes. We came to party. - Oh, come on, Lance. For once I agree with Corey. Just make the best of it. This isn't so bad. I mean, we're working on a fantastic yacht. We're sailing the Caribbean. This is how real adventure begins! I feel like Errol Flynn! (laughing) - Hedgeworth, you're weird. (laughing) - I hope one of you boys can cook because, um, we can't. - Not to worry, I can cook. - Oh great, first we gotta do dishes now we gotta eat the Hedgeworth's cooking. - Well, I sure do feel sorry for you boys. Having to work so hard in this very hot kitchen. I don't know how you can stand it. It's really hot. It is so hot in here. - [Corey] Hey, Lance, getting a little hot in here? - [Lance] Yeah. - You see, boys, getting mixed up with us wasn't such a bad idea after all. All your hard work will have its rewards, I promise. - (together) It is so hot. - Maybe I don't feel so much like Errol Flynn. Maybe more like Woody Allen. I'll see you guys later. - Well, I gotta tell ya. I will even make out with the captain. That's what he said. Yeah, the captain and then he leaves me. All alone here while he goes out having his fun. (chuckles) Come over here, baby. (dramatic music) Ah, man. Ah! (coughs) Albert. Boom! (people laughing) - So then he turns to me and he says, I'll give you $15 million to just walk out of this room and forget we ever existed. Looked him straight him in the eye and I said no. (people laughing) - [Lance] What a great story. - [Corey] And how much did you end up with? - [Walter] Ah, you tell him, Mike. - [Mike] We walked, but not before we got $25 million. - You're different than your two friends. - I guess I am. They're okay. Corey's pre-law. Lance is a jock, he's got a free ride. Wrestling, he's pretty good. - What about yourself? - Me, I'm a biologist. I'm a year away from my doctorate. (cat meowing) (lip smack) - And don't you run away from Mama anymore. - [Bobbie] Why is it so hot? - Now, Suzanne, you remember our deal. Keep that cat away from me or I'll give it a swimming lesson. - Oh, it's just a sweet little thing. You're not gonna hurt anybody, are you, baby? - I am such a pushover. - That's right. (laughing) - What? Why do you prefer the company of this, him, to me, hm, why? - He has brains. - Brains, what would you know about brains? You are such a dumb broad! - Hey, wait a second. There's no reason to talk to her like that. - It's okay, Martin. He's just a little drunk, he's making a joke. Mr. Graham and I are old friends. - That's right, we are old, old friends. (upbeat music) - If you two will excuse me, I guess I should relieve Albert at the wheel. - Well, that's right, you go ahead! 'Cause you're sure not doing this party any good! - Crikey. - All right. - Babe, shall we tango?

Nothing's gonna keep me from getting to the Caymans! - Us, we're on the same boat together, remember? (waves crashing) (upbeat music) - So what do you think? You like Lance. Flaughs) - Yeah, he's a real stud. What about Corey? - He's a little preoccupied with money. Don't you think? - Yeah. Tell me seriously you wouldn't mind living like this all the time. - Mm-hmm. Yeah. Could get used to it. (laughs) - What a thought. (engine revving) - What happened? - I don't know exactly. She's running way too hot. I have to shut her down. - For how long? - If I had a halfway decent crew, I wouldn't have to stop her in the first place. I can't even find that nitwit Albert. (dramatic music) (cat meowing) - [Martin] I can't find him. - This is what I was afraid of, there was an accident. He must have fallen overboard. - Oh my god. - I had a feeling this was gonna be a bad run. (upbeat music) - You ain't handling this right. She ain't gonna buy it. - Our little lady captain is gonna jump at it. - Looks like Albert fell overboard last night. - What? Are you sure? - [Rachel] We've looked everywhere. - That's just awful. - Well, I have to notify the authorities and then we have to go back and look for him. - Backtrack? You gotta be kidding. We can't be going back! - Well, I'm afraid that can't be helped considering the circumstances. - I hadn't planned on telling you this until we arrived at port. You see, if we make my deadline, let's just say I'll be a very rich man and among other things I won't be needing this boat anymore. - Transfer of ownership papers? - In your name, all legit and at a price you can manage, that is if you think you can get your charter business going again. - I'm not trading a man's life for a boat. - That's very commendable. No matter what you may think of me, I wouldn't either. Mike, tell her. - Well, it doesn't make sense. We can't be spending all of those days with the authorities, wasting their time, wasting their money. Risking their lives for a body that they ain't gonna find. - You can't be certain of that. - Yes, I can. Albert couldn't swim. - Is that true? - I'm afraid so. It's a shame about Albert, I liked him. - Yeah, well, he's shark bait now. All right, make up your mind, Rachel. Do you want the yacht or not? - I'll have to make a record in my log. - Well, of course, I would expect no less. - Mm. Ah! - That's right. (laughing) (water splashing) (dramatic music) - Decided to continue passage to the Cayman Islands. Captain's decision based on. - Do you have a sextant? - Yes, Why? - Can I take a look at it? - Okay, but, Martin, a sextant's used for navigation. - I know, I just want to try it out for something else here. Does this look like it could be Albert's? - Could be, why? (thrilling music) - Do you have a prism or a magnifying glass, something like that? - [Rachel] Mm-hmm. - Do you have any water? Any liquid at all? Hold that there. - Thanks. - Like that? - Yeah. Thanks. - [Rachel] What is it? - Look. - Martin, what am I looking at? - Blood cells, but this is a hundred, maybe even a thousand times normal, even for fresh blood. - And you think this is Albert's blood? - I don't know. (Upbeat pop music) (cat meowing) (exhahng) - I think you're better than Jane Fonda. - Thanks. - You know, when I get this tug to where we're going, it's gonna be so much money. El mucho good life. - Doesn't look like you're suffering too bad right now. (chuckles) - This is nothing. I wanna tell you, Bobbie, you sure are one hell of a good looking woman. - Thanks. - When I saw you in the spa with your body shining in the sun, you would have to be restrained to keep me away. - I guess that's a compliment, huh? - It's your pretty little body, babe. - Walter, I'm trying to work out, you know. - Well, you just forget about that 'cause I'm gettin' real tired of you girls leading me on. From now on we're gonna play it my way or the game's over and you get out. - (chuckles) Oh, Walter, we're miles out to sea. Now, how am I gonna get out? - We've got a lifeboat. - You wouldn't dare. - You wanna bet? - Walter, now don't be stupid! (cat screeching) - [Walter] There's nothing stupid about this. - Hey, what the hell are you doing? - Hey, just get lost, kid. This is none of your business. - Leave her alone! (glass breaking) (cat meowing) ' Stop it! (Walter groans) (gun fires) (Bobbie screams) - What the hell is going on, Walt? - Dumb kid jumped me when I wasn't looking. - Oh god. - Uh yeah? - No, you can't! - Just watch me. - Mike, Wait, hold it! - No, stop! (gun firing) - Hold it! - Corey! (Bobbie screams) (Mike grunts) - Oh. God. (Mike screams) (growling) (Mike screams) (gun fires) (glass breaking) (gun firing) (Mike groans) (gun fires) Oh, god. (Mike groans) - Oh my god. - We gotta stop the bleeding. - I'll get the first aid kit. - What happened? - What happened? For god's sake! - The cat, the cat. (Mike screams) (Mike groans) - His heart's racing a mile a minute. His pulse is going crazy. - What happened to him? He just went nuts! I've never seen anything like this! It's not like him! - A cat couldn't have done this. Look, it's right through the shoe. - It was the cat. - He's crazy, there's no way a cat could do that. - I don't see how either. Somebody better get on the radio and get some medical assistance and fast or I'm gonna lose this guy. - Okay. Just keep that on there, all right? - [Bobbie] Yeah. - Suzanne, come with me. Suzanne, come here, come here. Hold this button down and call may day, may day. I'm gonna find where the nearest medical facility is. (dramatic music) - Put that thing down. - What are you doing? - I said put the damn radio down! - Are you crazy! - We had a deal about getting straight to the Caymans, remember? - Those two people might die if we don't get 'em to a doctor. - The kid's gonna be all right. Mike is my problem. - Now, do you want that boat or not? - Not with this much blood on it. May day, may day, this is the Caribbean Sun. We have a medical emergency. I repeat, may (jay, may day (gun firing) (sparks crackling) - Now, start the engine and get us headed for the Cayman's. - I'm not taking this boat anywhere. I don't think you're gonna shoot the only person who can operate it. - Fine. Then I'll just blow her head off and everyone else's on board one at a time until you get me where I wanna go! - You wouldn't dare. - You're way outta your league, sweetheart. (Suzanne gasps) - Oh my 90d- - This one goes right between her eyes. - [Suzanne] No. (Suzanne whimpers) - All right, stop it, I'll do it! - Get this boat moving. - Look, I've told you that the engine is heating up. If it dies, we're dead in the water and I can't guarantee I can fix it. - You get this thing going right now! (Rachel sighs) (engine revving) Cut the crap, Rachel, and start this thing! - What the hell do you think I'm trying to do? - Just get away! ' Stop it! - No way. You just stand back. This thing is gonna start. (sparks crackling) What the hell happened here? (fire extinguisher blowing) (Walter groans) (Walter coughs) - Rachel, stop, hold it, hold it. You can't let her. I mean, wait a minute, look. I'm sorry, okay? It's just that I. Come on, wait, wait, stop. Hold it, you can't let her! I mean, okay, I'm sorry, all right? It's just that-- - Suzanne, it's all right. You'll get your chance. Keep the gun on the scumbag, but if he moves, blow his balls off. (Mike groans) - As near as I can tell, the cat that bit Mr. Harvey is highly poisonous. - A poisonous cat. Now how is that possible? - I found a piece of blood-stained shirt this morning. Rachel and I took a pretty good look at the blood and it was mutating like nothing I've ever seen or heard about. (Mike groans) - [Corey] Maybe the cat's got rabies. - [Mike] on god. - No, I've seen rabies. I know what it does to the blood. This was a mutation. It's definitely not rabies. - Look, Bobbie says she saw the cat while it was running from you. - [Mike] NQ_ - Tell Martin what you told me. - Well, it all happened really fast. - I don't know, it didn't look like the cat, but it had to be. I don't know. His face was distorted or something, I don't know, I mean. It sounds crazy. I don't know. Did it look like a normal cat to you before, Suzanne? - Of course, it's just a cat. - Oh god help me. - Martin, could this have anything to do with that laboratory tag that cat was wearing? - What are you talking about? - Shut up, Graham. You know, you have been a major disappointment to me. - Suzanne may be on to something. There's a great deal of experimentation on lab animals. Maybe somehow this cat's system has got some type of experimental chemical in it. I don't know. It seems to me like our cat might administer that very same chemical when it bites. Now if they've given it some type of a metabolic steroid, that might explain the strength to bite through the shoe. - You mean they actually poisoned that poor cat and now it's dangerous to all of us. - All I know for sure is that the blood cells in Mike's body are multiplying at a phenomenal rate. Somehow he's been poisoned. - Yeah, well, you got some of Mike's blood on your hands. How come you aren't sick? - Most likely it can only be transmitted by actual contact with my blood, byingesfingit Just touching it or getting it on my skin shouldn't hurt me. - Oh god. Oh. Oh. (heart beating) (blood spurting) Oh god. Oh god. (dramatic music) Oh god. (water splashing) - What's gonna happen to us? - We're gonna survive. We're gonna get this boat started and we're gonna survive. - Is this really necessary? - Shut up! I can't believe that you shot up that radio! You know, you're real lucky they won't let me blow your head off. - You wouldn't have the guts to shoot me even if they did let you, preppy. - Rachel, I've still gotta get to the Cayman Islands. - That's the least of our problems. Let's go. (thrilling music) - How ya feeling? - I'm okay, really. (door creaks) - What was that in the closet? - Probably just the boat creaking. - How do you know? I mean, what if it's the cat? - Don't worry. I'll go check, okay? - No, you stay here. I'll do it. (Suzanne sighs) Are you sure? - Yeah. - You ready? (dramatic music) (Suzanne chuckles) (Suzanne sighs) - It was just me and my father after that. This ship was his dream for both of us. Then we had some storm damage, Dad got sick. He got behind on payments to the bank. Graham owns the boat now. So if I'm ever gonna get this boat back I better get this damn engine fixed. You see this pump here? - Yeah. - It brings sea water in to cool the engine. I gotta trace every hose and electrical wire, and. Um, give me a hand here. - All right. - You got a lotta nice stuff here for a creep, Graham. - That's what happens when you've got money, preppy. - Ain't that the truth. - And you don't know the half of it. - Mm, mm, mm. - You like that? - [Corey] You kidding me? I always wanted one of these. - Keep it. - What? - What are you deaf as well as dumb? Go ahead, take it. I've got a drawer full of them. - I guess you really are a rich SOB, aren't ya? - And getting richer all the time. - Here let me show you something. - Whoa, not so fast. - Hey, take it easy, be careful. I'm just gonna get something out of the wall safe. Okay, nice and slow. (dial turning) Go ahead, you can open it. Be my guest. - Go ahead, but you do it nice and slow so I can see everything. - [Walter] Very well. Feast your eyes. - How much is that? - One million American dollars cash. (bills slapping) Buy a lotta watches. Well, opportunity is knocking, wake up. Take a bundle. There's plenty more where that came from. - Oh yeah, how much more? - You help me get to my bank in the Cayman Islands without anymore hassles, and you'll be using that for pocket change. (Corey laughs) - You know, somehow I don't trust you, Mr. Graham. (Walter laughs) - I'd be disappointed if you did. But try, son. (dramatic music) - Rachel. - [Rachel] SQ? - So, it means that any food the cat comes in contact with becomes contaminated. - Yeah, well the foods all locked up, right? - Yes, it's safe. - The cat's gonna get awful hungry. - What are you trying to say, Martin? - [Martin] I'm just saying that we've gotta stay alert. That's all. (Bobbie moans) (meowing) (Bobbie gasps) - Oh no. Go away, please. Oh. - Ain't nothing here but us little pussy cats! - Well, you almost scared me to death! - Come on, what are you scared of a little cat? - Yeah, you're damn right I am. If you were smart you would be, too. - Well, you want me to stay here and protect you from the big, bad bogeyman? - Matter of fact, I would feel better with a big strong man here to protect me. And you know what? I'm willing to do whatever it takes to keep him here. (sensual music) - If you really wanna be protected you're gonna be smart to stick by me no matter what happens from here on out. (lips smack) - Why do you think I picked you from the beginning? It was obvious you were going places. - Yeah, that's right. I'm going places. I got it all worked out. Once we're off this boat things are just gonna slide into place. - You mean if. If we get off this boat. - We Will. If I have to row this thing back to shore. I'm gonna make things happen for me. (chuckles) - Two days stranded. Damn it, you'd think we'd find something out here. - Okay, let's give it a try. See what we got. (engine revving) (engine revving) Damn it, I just don't have the parts! I just can't keep-- - You're doing the best you can. - I never should have left port. You know, listening to Graham was just the stupidest thing that I could have ever-- - Nobody's blaming you. Just gotta keep trying. - You're right, Martin. I'll be all right. (Lance sighs) (Walter sighs) - I thought itwas gonna start this time. - Yeah, me, too. So how's your shoulder, huh? - Better, really. Except for the damndest thing. I've lost all the feeling in my arm. It doesn't hurt, nothing, no feeling at all. Kinda tingles, you know, like when your arm falls asleep. - Mm-hmm. Well, I know something that'll help. - Yeah. - Uh huh. This is just what the doctor ordered. (lips smack) (Lance chuckles) What is it? - I was just thinking, even though I lost the feeling in my arm, it doesn't seem to affect other parts of my body. (laughing) - Here, let me take a look at that boo-boo. (dramatic music) (Bobbie screams) (Lance screams) - Get it off! (Bobbie screams) Oh god, my hand! Oh god, Oh god, my hand, no! - Lance, don't worry, just wait! - Calm down! Didn't you hear what Mike said? I'm fucked! Lance,Lance,no! No, stop! - No, you heard what Mike said, I'm poisoned! I'm already dead! - Lance, okay. - Oh, my hand! Did you see that thing? Did you see it? There's poison in my blood! - Wait, Lance, it's okay! - I got the poison in my blood! - No, please don't, please don't! I know-- - Lance, wait! No wait! - Not like that, don't go! - I got the poison in my blood! - Don't jump, please! - Lance! No wait! (Lance screams) (Bobbie screams) Lance! (water splashing) No, Lance! - I'm going in, too. (water splashing) - Can you see him? (fire crackling) Here. - God damn it! I can't believe what happened. It's just not real. - He was yelling about having poison in his blood. (suspenseful music) - There's no more fresh water. How about some champagne? - [COFQy] Yeah. - Save that. We've gotta tighten up on supplies. - We're all gonna die out here. I mean, let's face it. We're all gonna die on this stupid boat. - Take it easy, Suzanne. We're not gonna die, we're gonna survive. - He's right, Suzanne. We're gonna make it. We'll have that engine fixed in no time, right, Martin? - That's right. We've almost got it. We give up now, we might as well just lie down and die. We're gonna get outta here if we just keep fighting. - You're lying. You're both lying! We're never gonna get out of this alive! We're all gonna die! That thing's gonna bite us and we're all gonna die a horrible death! (Suzanne groans) - Any luck? - No. Look, we need to let Walter Graham out. - Never. - Look, we don't have much of a choice. We need his help. - And what kinda help can he give us? - He can give us plenty of help. Look, while you two are fixing the motor, he and I can form sort of a cat assault team. - You don't know Walter Graham like I do, and I don't like the idea of letting him out. - No, Corey's right. We're running out of time here. We can't afford to have anybody not pulling his weight. He and Graham could look for the cat. You and I can work on the boat around the clock. We can have Suzanne keep watch. - Right. - How's that sound? - All right then. It's settled. - Get away from me. I'm not helping you with anything. - You will take watch like you're told. - No. - Listen, you bitch, if you hadn't a brought that goddamn cat-- - Corey, Corey, hold on! - (whimpers) I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - You wanna get off this boat, don't you, Suzanne? - Yes. - We all do. And we're going to. Everybody's gotta help, gotta do their job. You can understand that. - Yeah. - Now we need you keeping watch out for planes and ships. Okay? - Okay. You said it was good luck to bring a cat on board. - That's right, I did. - Then it's your fault that cat's here, it's not mine! - You're right, you're right, but I still need you to stand watch. - Okay- - [Suzanne] But I want Corey to know who's at fault here. - It's okay, Corey knows. Don't you, Corey? - Yeah. Now come on and take the damn binoculars. I am gonna go get Graham. - Corey! - Yeah. - Be careful. - Yeah, don't worry about Walter. I can handle him. - I meant the cat. - Don't worry, I got it all figured out, Mr. Graham. - Yeah. There's still a chance I could get to my bank on time. Listen, that thing could jump out from anywhere Let me have the gun. Look, son, you trust me, don't you? Let me have the gun. - Yeah. Yeah, I trust you, Mr. Graham. Let's nail this cat. Then I got some ideas. This looks like a prime spot. Yeah. Have these babies in the right places. Our little friend is history. - Just the smell of that stuff is making me salivate. - If you knew how much poison I put in it you'd lose your appetite real quick. (Corey chuckles) I'll show Martin he's not the only smart one around here. After all, the hunt is still the hunt. - I don't know, Martin, maybe you're right. If I could just hold out, I should be able to get that engine running. - Yeah, if the food'll last that long. Here, it's your turn to serve dinner. Cereal again, mm mm! - Will you be joining us? - No, no, I have a previous engagement to become a master mechanic. - Well, maybe I can interest you in a midnight snack. (lips smack) (flakes rattling) - That's it? What kinda food is this? - Where's Corey? - He's out checking his traps. - I hope he's caught that thing. I can't sleep with that cat crawling around. - Well, here's to a dead cat. (dramatic music) - That oat knows that the food's poisoned. (cocking gun) (creature screeching) (Corey shouts) What is that? (gun firing) (Corey screams) (creature screeches) (Corey groans) (water splashing) (gears squeaking) - What the hell do you think you're doing? - Something that I should have done days ago. - You won't last two days in that lifeboat. Our only chance is to stay with the ship and to get it going- Then maybe someone will spot us. (dramatic music) How the hell that thing get in here? It's lined with metal. - I don't know. - Well, how'd you let that happen? You were supposed to be in charge of the food. - We didn't let anything happen. You've been sittin' around on your ass the whole damn time. We've been working on the engine and the food and everything. I assume it pried through the sheet metal by itself with its own paws. - Oh god, who cares. Now we don't have any food left. - The cat should be satisfied for now with the contaminated food and water and all that. - Why the hell shouldn't it be? It's in a lot better shape than we are. - We're all gonna die anyways. - What the hell are you doing? (Suzanne shouts) - I'm looking for something to eat. I'm starving to death. - Suzanne, everything in here's contaminated. - That's what you say. I don't believe you. You and Rachel are just hoarding it all for yourselves. - Don't be ridiculous. Suzanne, you're gonna have to pull yourself together. This food is poisonous, it's poisonous, do you understand me? Everybody's getting the same share of food. That's just the way it is. I'm sorry, Suzanne. (Suzanne whimpers) (tool clanging) - Okay, I'm going to the wheel. I'm gonna hit the ignition switch. When I do, just pull that lever to the left. Okay? - Okay- - What are you doing sleeping? - What, what, what? - You were sleeping. You're supposed to be keeping your eyes open! - Oh. And what the hell are you doing? - Drop dead. - I guess I shoulda known better. - Rachel, if you haven't noticed it's all over. It doesn't matter anymore. Nothing matters. - Well, you two may be ready to give up, but I'm not. - Well, at least you're being consistent with being a dumb bitch! You know, all you had to do to get this boat back was be nice to me and you weren't even smart enough to do that. And now you're too dumb to know when to quit. Just like you're daddy. (slapping) How do you think I got this boat? I own this boat because I was smart and your daddy was dumb like you. - Yeah, well, you're an idiot, Walter, and you always were. Now, you two can just stay out here and die if you want to but not me. (Suzanne laughs) - What are you laughing at? You're gonna die! (Walter laughs) (dramatic music) (keys rattling) - I knew it! Just a pack of lies. Keeping all this food just for themselves. (cat meowing) No, get away from me! Don't worry, I only took a little bit. (cat meowing) You're not gonna hurt me. You're a sweet little. (choking) (muffled screaming) (cat meowing) (muffled screaming) (coughing) (cat meowing) (thunder cracking) (water rushing) - What are we gonna do? You gotta fix that! - It depends on the storm. - What? Well, you gotta do something. It's not gonna stop in two minutes! (thunder cracking) - We have to hurry! We're taking in too much water! Where's Graham? - I don't know! - Come on, Graham! - I got one more briefcase. I'll be right back! - We don't have time, forget it! We don't have time! - I got one more briefcase! I'll be right back! - No, Graham! - Wait for me! (cat meowing) (creature growls) (Graham groans) (thrilling music) - Where's Graham? - I don't know, forget about him! - I'm going for him, you take it down! - Not without you! - You gotta do it, do it yourself! I'll jump in and swim! (dramatic music) - Come on, jump! - Come on! We gotta get outta here, she's goin' down! I'm sorry, Rachel! - Graham? " No! I wonder what was so important in this damn briefcase that he gave his life for it! - There must be a million dollars in here! (upbeat music) - Enough to buy a new boat! - And enough to finance a study of psychobiology! - Yeah! Ah! (Rachel screams) (creature growls) - Are you all right? - Did it bite you? - No, thank god! I think I'm okay! - Good! - Oh, Rachel, it's not over yet! (creature growls) (Rachel screams) It won't leave us alone as long as we're the only floating objects! - What do we do? - Here, maybe we can get it to get on this thing! - No wait a minute! Put it in here! - Come on! - It's getting on! (Rachel screams) (Martin cheers) - Sorry to keep you waiting but, understandably, due to the storm communications are backed up. Now as to your story about a monster, a poisonous cat, well, I'm afraid your ordeal must have been too much for you. Right now you need rest and relaxation. If there's any assistance I can be for you, contacting family or friends. - Oh, well, you've been so kind. We really don't know how to thank you. - It's my pleasure to help. - Thank you very much once again. You've been more help then you'll ever even begin to know. Thank you. (upbeat music) (seagulls cawing) (cat meowing) - Here, kitty, kitty, kitty. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty. (thrilling music) (thrilling music)
