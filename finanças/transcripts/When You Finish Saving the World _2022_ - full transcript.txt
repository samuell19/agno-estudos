- Yo yo yo, it's TheRealZiggyKatz here! I just want to say Dobry Dzien and Happy Wednesday to my friends in Minsk and Ni Hao and Happy Thursday to my Tigers out in Liajing. Xie xie for waking up so early! And of course dhonnobad to all my devoted Chittagong gals. I'm glad to see the floods haven't affected your internet connections. You all look super clear and ready for a show! Today, I'm debuting a tera lift new song for my favorite people in the whole wide world, my Hi-Hat fans. (upbeat guitar music) ♪ Pieces of gold straddling paper ♪ ♪ Owing to nothing and turning to vapor ♪ ♪ The air is thin, the marks are set ♪ ♪ You lift your chin, she feigns regret ♪ ♪ Two high speed trains on parallel tracks ♪ (heels clicking) (ladies chattering) - [Cathy] Evelyn! Have a piece of cake! - What's the occasion? - It's Leslie's birthday. - Yep, I'm 21! (ladies giggle) - Some of the women can hear the singing. - Oh no, really? - Yes, I'm doing intake with a new resident and her two children. - Shit, it's my fault. My voice carries. - Me too. Sorry Evelyn. - [Leslie] We'll try to keep it down. - Okay. - [Cathy] And we'll clean up before your three o'clock. - Thank you. Congratulations on your birthday, Leslie. (upbeat piano music) - There's a tajine in the oven. Did you have a good day? - A woman came in to the shelter today. She was about 26. Her kids were eight and four. Last night, her husband came home and locked the kids in the basement while he assaulted their mother upstairs. The police came and only spoke to the husband. Luckily, the eight year old recorded the audio on his phone. So, you know, every cloud, right? And how was your day, my dear? - Very productive. - Good, I'm glad. (soft music and singing) ♪ That's the way the earthquake rumbles ♪ ♪ And the house of cards falls down and tumbles ♪ ♪ That's the way the cookie crumbles down ♪ - Wow, that was the first time I ever played that song. I can't believe it went so well. I hope you guys had as much fun as I did. Remember to up-note me in the corner and if you liked what you heard, feel free to tip! And there's the early bird, Ludmila! Nishrita! Coming in close second. And not to be outdone, gracias to the Huertos family for all your generosity! You guys are all tera lift. So make sure you all come back next week, where I'll be debuting a new song about a girl that I like at school. This is TheRealZiggyKatz. Thanks for tuning in! Mom! Mom, did you try to open my door while I was live streaming? Dad?! - [Roger] Yeah? - Did Mom try to open the door while I was live streaming? - [Roger] I don't know. Ask her. - Mom, did you open my door while I was, shit, sorry. Did you try to open the door while I was live streaming? - [Evelyn] I'm taking a shower, Ziggy. - Did you? - [Evelyn] What's live streaming? - Where I basically make all my money, where thousands of kids who are desperate to hear me perform log on every week and tip me and up-note me and I'm one of the highest performers on the site? - [Evelyn] Well, that all sounds very impressive. - It is. - And what do you plan on doing with all that hard earned money? - [Ziggy] Spend it. - On what, my child? - I dunno, probably a new guitar and a new mic and probably a better translation software because I wanna play for African kids and they have like, a hundred different languages there. - So you're going to use the money you make from playing your songs to buy more equipment to play your songs. - [Ziggy] Yeah. - Well that's a tautological nightmare, don't you think? - [Ziggy] What? - Well I mean, it sounds like you're on an exhausting loop. Have you thought about an endgame? - Oh, an endgame? I don't know. I'm gonna be rich and you're gonna be poor? - Oh, you're going to be rich and I'm going to be poor. - [Ziggy] Yeah, just don't open my door again. - When you're live streaming. - [Ziggy] Right. - Right. (soft music) - And Hearts of Palm. - Where'd you get the chicken? - Patsy's farm. She also had a surplus of tomatoes, which I bought. - Very good, I'll make a gazpacho tomorrow. - I mean, he's basically giving the guitar away. To get a Strat from that year at that price is basically free, you know? - Just make sure you don't play the blues. - What? - You don't play blues music, do you? - No, I play folk rock, classic folk rock with alternative influences. - I don't know what that means. - Well, I could play for you. I just debuted a new song, "Truth Aches." I could show it to you. - What'd you say it's called? - Did you say "Truth aches?" - Yeah, do you wanna hear it? - Well, I'm assuming we're not your target audience. - [Ziggy] Right. - I mean, it's geared toward teenagers, am I right? - Yeah, sure. - Because it's incredibly unethical, white people playing blues music. Did you ever read Amiri Baraka? - Who? - Roger, please. - Because he's very explicit on the issue of cultural appropriation. - Jesus Christ, Roger. - Dad, I don't play blues music. God, shut the fuck up. - [Roger] Okay, okay, I'm just saying. (soft music) - Hey Mom, can you drive me today? - Are you ready to go now? - Yeah, just give me like five seconds. (soft music) (intense instrumental music) - You're on the city council. How difficult is it to get some goddamn painters in here, Homer? We have women coming in. It's the middle of goddamn night and they have nowhere to park their cars. We're talking about two white lines on the fucking asphalt. (soft knocks) - Um, Ms. Katz? I just wanted to let you know I just did outtake. - Hold on a second, Homer. - Yeah, I'm going home. Well, to my sister's, but I'm getting out of here. Yay me! - That's wonderful dear. - Can I give you a hug? - Um, yes, of course. - You saved my life. You saved my daughter's life. - I'm sorry about that Homer. - [Lila] No, no no no, the US not only ignores humans rights abusers, but they purposely, maliciously profit off them. And the worst offense is this sanctimonious savior complex where we're distributing our morally superior values to the unwashed masses like they're sitting around the desert waiting for someone to descend from the heavens. - Well what would you rather, for China to swoop in, or maybe Russia, or maybe some other amoral actor? It's not like the US steps out-- - Hey Ziggy, want a hit? - No. Shut up! I'm trying to listen. - By that logic, we should just occupy every country that might be at a slight risk of intervention because we're the bastion of peace and equity. - Yeah, thank you for making my point. - I was being sarcastic. - So was I. - You're infuriating. - Thank you. - Yo, I agree with you Lila. - Thank you, Ziggy! See, someone's got my back. - Yo, of course man. - How? - What? - How do you agree with Lila? - Oh shit, yeah, um. Well you mentioned China, right? - Yes. - Cause I play music for these Chinese girls on Hi-Hat. I actually have like 20,000 followers. I'm in the top percentage of performers. I'm validated and I'm starred, which is tera hard to get. And like, the girls that I play for are super dope. This one girl, SeaKitten, that's her handle, who tipped me 20 credits last week after I wished her a happy birthday, so... So I guess just in terms of what you're saying Lila, I totally agree with you. - [Becky] A stirring defense. (group chuckles) (upbeat instrumental music) - [Angie] And he's not a big guy, and he wasn't even drunk. But he's got his hands around my neck. - Was this the first time he did this? - It was the first time that day. Then he just kind of gets up and he says he's got to go pee. - And then you called the police? - No, I didn't call the police. - Oh, it says that Sergeant McKenna brought you in. I thought-- - Right, well Kyle called the police. - Yeah, I called them. - And where were you? - I was just next door at Sean's. - Yeah, his friend Sean's. They've been friends since forever. - So she texted me and I ran back home. - How old are you, Kyle? - Seventeen. - He's my little knight in shining armor. You are, you're the only good thing in my life. It's true, kids are just pure love, you know what I mean? - Mm-hmm. - You know, when he was just six years old, miss-- I'm sorry, what's your name again? - I'm Evelyn. - Evelyn, shit I'm sorry. Well when Kyle was six years old, his father hits me and I get this nasty cut over my eyebrow. And I didn't even know that Kyle knew anything. I mean, who knows what kids know about their parents? But anyway, he comes into the room. He says he's had a bad dream, can I come and stay in his bed? - Mom, stop. - No, she needs to hear this, okay? So anyways, we're laying in bed and I just whisper to him, "Do you want to tell me about your nightmare?" And he says, "I didn't have a nightmare." He just knew I needed out of that room. You know, he's only six years old, so he just-- I'm a bad mother. - [Evelyn] Angie. - No no no, I'm a bad mom. - Angie, you're not a bad mother. You're in the right place. You're very, very safe. And you will have two very comfortable beds for as long as you need. - Hey Mom, you know what I think you could use right now? - [Angie] What? - A new tissue. (Angie laughs) Yeah, don't touch me. (soft instrumental music) (soft instrumental music) (screwdriver whirring) ♪ That's the way the earthquake crumbles ♪ - Hello! What the hell are you doing? - [Ziggy] Installing a red beacon light so people know when I'm livestreaming. - And by people you-- - [Ziggy] I mean you. - Well, I figured that. - [Ziggy] And to a lesser extent Dad. - Well, it's nice to be ranked first. - Yeah, so when the light is on, you don't knock or come in or make any noise. - And when it's off, I'm free to go about my business, to enjoy the rich pageantry of life? - What? Yeah sure. - It's a good system. (screwdriver whirring) You know, there are a couple of projects around the shelter that could use a handyman. - Like what? - Well, I've been waiting on these goddamn painters to come out for the residents parking spot out front. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm, just some white paint with some blue trim. - Wouldn't the city need to do that if it's like a street parking spot? - I suppose so. But I'm sure there's a bunch of other stuff, some bathroom mirrors and some light fixtures. Maybe on the weekend, you can come in for a couple of hours and then afterwards we could go out to dinner together? - This weekend? - [Evelyn] Yes. - And it'd be like as a volunteer? - As opposed to what? - [Ziggy] A paid employee. - Oh, yes, a volunteer. - I'm busy this weekend. - [Evelyn] Uh, okay. - Yeah, so it'd be impossible. - You're a very lucky boy. - [Ziggy] What? - Nothing, nothing.

It's not that mind blowing. - Yeah totally, it's like everybody from school, tera lift to see you guys. - Cool, well it was good to see you. Have a nice time. - Hey, I thought it was lift the way you were talking the other day at lunch, like about all the political stuff. I just thought you were super honest and passionate. And like, I write music. - Yeah, you were saying. - Yeah, and in my music I'm all about being passionate and honest too. I have 20,000 followers and I think what they like about me is my passion and charisma and I thought that you had that too. - Thanks, I don't really think about it in those terms, like as a commodity. - Oh, lift. - Have you ever thought about what you could do with a platform like that or are you just happy taking people's money? - Um, I guess the first thing. - Cause it sounds like you have a really good opportunity to start a grassroots movement about environmental issues that concern you or political corruption, especially if you're streaming in countries that are in need of organizing from non-political actors. - Yeah, I don't know, man. I think I'm more of a vacation. Like they deal with all that shit all day, like the corruption and the poverty or whatever. Like they're just wandering the dirty streets of their towns and then they come home and they see my page and it's like 'ahhhh.' - Right. - Like sometimes I feel like the world would be a better place if people just chilled out and listened to music, you know? - Hmm. - But I mean, I guess I could think about it. It could be kinda lift to change it up sometime. - Yeah, it could be. - Cause like you said, I've got a huge platform, 20,000, so. - [Emcee] Hear ye, hear ye! We will not stand by. We will stand up through revolutionary art. Let the performances commence. - Are you gonna do anything? - I have a poem. - Oh lift, I have a song. - [Bandana Guy] Yo yo yo, what's up, what's up. This piece is about the patriarchy, of which I'm a reluctant member. (soft music) - Hello. - Oh, hey Evelyn, how you doing? - I'm doing well, thank you. How about you? Do you like it here? Do you have any complaints? - No, not really. I mean, it's great. My mom's happy here. That's the main thing. - What are you working on over there? - Algebra. - Ooh, I would offer to help you, but I don't remember how to do it. - That's cool. It comes kind of easy to me. - Well, you're naturally very bright. Where do you go to school? - Hamilton. - Oh, my son goes there. - It's a big school. - Yes, it's too big, I think. So I need your help with something. - What? - I need someone tall. I used to rake in like 200 to 250 bucks in a weekend. - Well, that's quite a lot of money. - You think? - I do, I do think. - But the restraining order kind of killed the whole thing. I mean, any guy that hits his wife is terrible in my book. But I could take it, you know? Now I've literally got no income. - Well, would you ever want to work anywhere besides the auto body shop? - I don't know, my dad owned the place so it was kind of perfect. It'd be like your son working here. You said you had a son, right? - [Evelyn] Yes. - Yeah, so it'd be a sweet job. I mean, if your mom owned the place. Oh, can you pass me a screwdriver, the yellow one? - Oh, the yellow one. - [Kyle] Yes. Thank you. - There you go. - And I was seriously good at it too. I mean, my dad used to say that kids make the best mechanics cause they've got tiny little fingers. Actually, it sounds kind of creepy when I say it now. - It does sound a little creepy, yes. You're not going to become him. - [Kyle] What? - You're not going to become him Kyle, if that's what you're worried about. - What, no, I'm not worried about that. - Oh, right, of course not. - Why would I become him? He's a dick. - Yes, no, my mistake. - [Kyle] I'm like a normal dude. - Yes, you are. You are, you're better than normal. I was very taken with the way you behaved with Angie, with your mother, the other night. - What do you mean? - Well, you were very gentle with your mother at a vulnerable time. If I can speak freely, I was moved. - Well, my mom's gotten the shit kicked out of her since she was born. - I know. - Do you? - Well, I can imagine. Kyle, would you be open to discussing options for your future, other than the body shop? - [Kyle] Like what? - Well, are there any other jobs you might be interested in? - Well when I was a kid, I always wanted to play for the Pacers. - The Pacers? - [Kyle] Yeah, the basketball team. - Oh right, yes. Well, is there anything else? Anything a little more practical? - [Kyle] The body shop is practical. - Yes, of course, yes it is. You know, I was just like you. When I was your age, I was determined to become the editor of "Rolling Stone" magazine. And then when I went to college I met someone who introduced me to a life of social service and I'm embarrassed that I ever considered anything else. - I mean, yeah, but people still need to have their cars fixed. - [Evelyn] Oh, of course they do. - So it's not like a totally stupid job. - Oh yes, yes, no it's a very good job. It's a very important job, but you have an unusual heart Kyle. I mean, most boys your age can't bring themselves to be kind and you can't help yourself. - You really think so? - You're a special person. I'm sorry. - No, it's cool. - You know, my friend Margaret runs the social work program at Oberlin. - Where's Oberlin? - Well, it's just next door in Ohio. It's actually a very beautiful town and you'd be surrounded by people like you, bright, curious, good young people. - How much is it? - Well, there are all sorts of scholarships for people in your situation and Margaret owes me a favor. Let me make a few calls. - Seriously? - [Evelyn] Absolutely. - Yo, thank you so much Evelyn. - It is unquestionably my pleasure. - Ohio. - And we both never tell a lie. Or do we? (audience applause) - That was very powerful. Thank you so much. Up next we have Lila Stryjewski with an original poem. - Yo, good luck Lila, not that you need it. - Hi everybody. This is just something I wrote about the Marshall Islands. They're in the Pacific Ocean and they've been exploited for centuries and they're now literally sinking due to the effects of global warming. I don't know if it's any good, but I guess that doesn't really matter. Anyway, here it is. Floating little worlds, bobbing in the sea. Unsuspecting, unexpecting war to shed his grace on thee. So it's 1526 when the Spaniards start to run like Pamplona bulls in china shops. Ain't colonialism fun? Then it is German New Guinea, but the age old story. And I'll give you the skinny but it's deliberately gory. Enslaving their people for some Copra Cabana. Until 1919, when they made way for Japan and it was 1526, so thanks for playing. Then it was 1885 so thanks for playing. Now it's 1919 so thanks for staying. For the Japanese mandate of the whole South Pacific. And it's some enchanted bullshit if you wanna get specific. You'll learn our language' you'll eat our food and you'll get no domo arigato. Bet you didn't think we're rude. Then it was 1954 so thanks for staying. For the powerful US, more like us versus them. We'll drop a kilo on your foxtrot, you're a pig stuck in the pen. We've worn out your bikini, we've capped you at the knees, leave you praying for the Spanish for a deadly disease. And it was 1592 so thanks for playing. Then it was 1885 so thanks for playing. And it was 1919 so thanks for playing. Then it was 1954, wish you were staying. But you're not. (audience applause) - Lila. - Hey dude. - That was amazing, like transcendent or whatever. - Sorry man, I didn't know where you went. - Who gives a shit. - Hey Lila. - [Lila] Hey Jackie. - Lift poem. - Would you mind if I read what you wrote? - What do you mean? - The poem, could I like, have it? - What are you gonna do with it? - I don't know, murder people by paper cutting them. No, I just want to read it again. - [Emcee] Next up we have Ziggy Katz with an original song. He's new here tonight so be nice. - I guess that's me, duty calls man. - He's a fucking genius. Bloomington, how is everybody feeling? Um, I wrote this song when I graduated Junior High and I had to say goodbye to all of my friends. Sometimes saying goodbye to good friends is tera hard.

Those people are a bunch of idiots. They only care about political shit. You're like a real artist. - What are you talking about? They loved me. - No they didn't. Most people were visibly rolling their eyes. I heard one girl say, "This is bullshit." And another one say, "This is lame bullshit." - Dude, if I worried about every fucker who didn't like me, I'd never wake up in the morning. It's the nature of success. - Oh. (car whirring) - Yo Moms! what's up? - I'm not shouting Ziggy. I'll speak to you when you're closer. Hello. - Hey. - How was your day? - It was great, yours? - Also very good, thank you. Hello. - Where the fuck were you guys? - At work. - School, man. - Today was my Chancellor ceremony. You knew this, you both knew this. - Was that today? - Oh shit, I am so sorry. - [Roger] Oh don't worry, I'm sure they'll give me another lifetime achievement award at some point. - Dad, I am so sorry. I had some important shit to take care of and I just thought that Mom was gonna be there. - Well yeah, I guess I thought that Ziggy was gonna be there so-- - Jesus fucking christ. - [Evelyn] What? - You both could have come. The two of you. - The two of us what? - [Roger] Everyone around me is a narcissist. - [Ziggy] What does that say about you? - That I'm unlucky. I'm going upstairs to read, try to keep it down. - He seems upset. (soft music) - Ziggy, don't sneak up on me like that. - Oh, I'm sorry. Could you take me to school? - Are you ready to go right now? - I'm right here dude. (soft instrumental music) (upbeat instrumental music) - Can I change the music? - To what? - Literally anything else? - I like listening to this music on the way to work. - It's elitist. - No it's not. - Of course it is, it's just a bunch of rich, white men. I don't care about that stuff, but you pretend to. So I just thought you should know it's kind of hypocritical. - Okay, thank you for the advice. - Sure. - Are you doing anything interesting in school today? - No. - Are you reading any books? - Yeah, we're doing "To Kill A Mockingbird" in Lit class. - It's always Harper Lee and never Toni Morrison. - What? - No nothing, I would just suggest you push yourself beyond the curriculum there. - Mom. - Yes? - Do you think I could be political? - I'm sorry, what? - Like, there are these kids at school and they're super political and stuff and I was just wondering if maybe you thought that I could be too? - Mm-hmm, what do they talk about, these other kids? - Just like everything, like wars and politicians and the environment. - And what do they say about all that? - Well, they're against most of it. I mean, not the environment, they're for that. - Well that's a relief. So what are you asking me? - Well, you're interested in that stuff too so I was just wondering if like, you had anything for me to say to them? - To get them to like you? - What, no. I want to be smart and interested too. - It sound to me like you want a shortcut to sound intelligent to get some kids to like you. - I don't want a shortcut. - No, then what is it then? If you want to talk to these kids, you should just listen to what they're saying and form your own opinion. I'm not gonna spoon feed you some cool line about the Middle East because you won't learn that way. - But half the time they're talking, I don't even know what they're saying. - Because you haven't done the work. - What work? - Well, you can't just jump right in the middle of a debate about something which you know nothing about. - Yeah, okay. - Well, if you don't make the effort to understand the issues that are affecting society, then your problems extend far beyond impressing your classmates. And there's no shortcut that I can give you-- - Mom, stop saying fucking shortcut! - You know, when you were a little boy, I brought you to every march, every protest. You were my little ally. You'd play all our protest songs on that plastic rainbow guitar that we got you. "Where Have All The Flowers Gone," "The Fiddle and The Drum," "There Once Was a Union Maid." Do you remember that? Your life was going to be happier because you were part of the struggle. You were going to be one of the good ones. And then something switched in you. You stopped being interested in anything outside your own little world. I would take you with me, but you would always want to go home. - Sorry about that. - I know that you want to impress these kids, but it's not going to impress them if it doesn't come from a sincere place, so do the work. Read, educate yourself, and then I'll help you and then we can talk about some things for you to say, okay? - Yeah. - Does that sound like a plan? - Yeah, it does. Thanks for the advice. - Of course. Have a good day, son. (loud smack) Jesus Ziggy! (intense instrumental music) - I'm gonna go get some baking soda. Yo Lila, what's up? - Hey, Ziggy. - Just getting some more baking soda, or whatever. - Cool man. - Hey, I just wanted to say that I was like, rereading your poem from the party and I just think it was so lift. I loved the phrasing and the build and everything. It's actually tera sophisticated. - Thanks for the validation, but you should probably put your goggles back on before Mr. Ryan sees. - What's he gonna do, arrest me? - You're a rebel. - Yup. Just got the baking soda. Actually, I'm just going to go get some more. - [Jackie] You're not gonna help me? - Jackie, fuck off, I'm doing something important. Hey man, I also just wanted to say-- - Jesus, stop fucking sneaking up on me. - Oh, sorry. I also just wanted to say that I know you talk about politics all time and I probably don't look like I know what I'm talking about, but I actually know a lot about all that stuff. Like you probably wouldn't know because I focus so hard on my music, but when I was a kid, I went to every protest and every sit-in and I was a real ally. I even played all these protest songs on this little plastic guitar like, "There Once Was Union Maid." - [Mr. Ryan] Ziggy, goggles! - Yep, shit, sorry. - Don't say shit. - Yep. So that's just like, what I wanted to say. - Thank you for saying it. - [Ziggy] You're welcome. - Ziggy. - Yeah? - You don't have to be interested in politics. - But I am. - No, you're not, it's obvious, but it's cool - You think I'm stupid? - No no, I didn't say that. - [Ziggy] So can you teach me? - About what? - I watch you talk about things, like big things. And you talk about them with such passion. Like the way most people talk about shit they just want to buy, you talk about the world. I want to be like that. I want to be like you. (keyboard clicking) - Hello Marci. - Hi, hi Evelyn. - Are you having a good day? - Yeah, it's good. So far so good. - Your work going well? - Yeah, it's great. - Do you enjoy it, do you enjoy the work? - Yeah, of course, it's very rewarding. - Will you tell me again how long you have been working here? - Uh, it'll be two years next month. Are you firing me? - No, oh no, no dear, you're a wonderful employee, no. I'm just talking. The elevator takes so long to come here. That was a nice conversation. (soft music) - Oh hi. - Hello, I just wanted to see if you were all right, if you needed anything from me or from any of us. - No, it's been great. Everyone is so helpful. - Good, good. - Do you want to come in? - Sure, why not. Is Kyle here? - He's just in the bathroom. Honey, Evelyn is here! - Hey. How's it going? - Oh very well, I was just checking up on you, making sure everything was to your liking. - And I said it was. Is your shirt okay? - Oh yes, it is. I don't know why I put this here. I brought you this hat, Kyle. - Indiana "acers." - Yes, I noticed that. I think the P fell off in the dryer. It was my son's but he no longer wears it. He wears, well actually, I don't know. I don't know what he wears anymore! Anyway, that is for you. - Thank you so much, Evelyn. - I remember you said you liked them. - He loves them, Evelyn! Kyle, say thank you. - I just did, mom. - Well, it was the least I could do. Kyle was very helpful with some minor repairs around the shelter. - Oh I heard. He said it was the highlight of his week. - Well, I like staying busy. - Oh well, in that case, how would you like to run an errand with me? - Mom? - You don't mind if I borrow him. Do you, Angie? - Sure. (upbeat instrumental music) - Feel free to change the station if there's something else you'd like. - No, this is cool. - It's not too stuffy? (upbeat instrumental music) - Okay, now that's everything. - Kyle, just put these in wherever they fit. Don't be precious about it. Not too heavy? - Of course not. - [Marcella] Is that your son? - No no, he's just a kid who works at the shelter. So, you'll appreciate this Kyle. Marcella does all the translations for the Spanish speakers at the shelter. The women are in and out of court all the time with custody and orders of protection. And you cannot imagine how rigged the system is against non-native English speakers. But Marcella is a genius, and that is not an exaggeration. - I am not a genius. - No no no, you're more effective than any lawyer we have ever hired. - Look, you can tell him the truth. I used to be a resident at the shelter. - Oh, really? - My husband - my ex husband - and I was undocumented. I couldn't go to the police and I couldn't go back to Honduras. - Shit, I'm sorry all that happened to you. - Thank you. - My mom and I are living there now. Yeah, my dad is kind of... - I know. - Un cabron. - Yo entiendo. - What was that? - Oh sorry, I was just saying that my dad's not really a great guy. - You speak Spanish? - I mean, high school Spanish. - La verdad. Habla muy bien! - Gracias. - Estuve saliendo con una dominicana por dos meses. - Yo tambien tuve un novio dominicano. - En serio? Y qué pasó? - No aguanté el merengue! - My goodness, you are full of hidden talents. - No, I guess I've just got a good ear. - Perdóname. Olvidé el azúcar! Te quiere? - Oh si. Gracias. - Okay Kyle, I think that we should be heading back. I don't want your mother to worry. - [Kyle] Oh, I don't think that she'll worry. - We really should go. And Marcella, thank you, thank you so much. It was great to see you and I will just bring my mug into the kitchen. - No, leave it. - No no no, I've got it. I'm gonna pop it into the dishwasher. Are these clean or dirty? - Marcella seems pretty cool. - She's fine, do you want to get something to eat? - Oh, I'm cool to just go back if you want. - No, let's get you something to eat, I owe you. (distant train horn) (soft music) - Hello! Hello? Mom? - I don't suppose you've had Ethiopian food before, have you? - Uh, no, definitely not. - You have to eat with your hands. I hope that's all right. - Do they give you gloves? - (laughs) That's cute. I think you'll enjoy it. My son used to love coming here and then he started complaining that his hands feel dirty. - That makes sense. - No, people get their hands dirty. It's a fact of life. You understand that because you've worked with cars. - I feel like I should have brought a fork. - Oh no, stop it, you're gonna be just fine. After you. - Thank you. (soft music) - Hi. - Oh, Jesus, fuck Dad! - [Roger] When did you get home? - Just now, where's Mom? - [Roger] Working late, I guess. - Okay, do you want to order pizza something? - I made a duck. (knife chopping) Do you want some wine? - No thanks, Dad. - Eh, it's not very good anyway. - So which one is Marci again? - When you walk in, she's the first desk. You've seen her a million times. - With the thick glasses? - Mm-hmm, yeah, exactly, Marci. - And she used to be a wrestler? - Mm-hmm, I'm serious! - Like ah...this Thursday, at Bankers Life Arena, I challenge you, Undertaker, in a fight to the death! - No no no no, not like that. College wrestling, you know, with the ugly one piece and the soft helmet. - I can't imagine her doing that. - And apparently, she was ranked very highly. - She was at IU? - Mm-hmm, a big time school, full ride. - For wrestling? - For wrestling, they give out scholarships for anything. That's what we have to find for you. - Right. - I'm still nudging my friend at Oberlin, but worst case scenario, we get you to IU on a scholarship or aid. They make the process unnecessarily complicated these days. - Yeah, I was thinking about all that, like since you mentioned it the other day. - Good, me too. This is embarrassing, but I actually got an online subscription to "US News &amp; World Report", just to check the college rankings. - Oh Evelyn, you don't have to do all that for me. - No, but I want to, I want to do it. Have you thought about a personal essay? - What's that? - Well, it shouldn't be hard for you because you've been through so much, but we'd have to codify it in a way that feels academic. - Right. - And it should be fun, it should be fun for us. - Cool. So do you like the food? - I do, yeah. I mean, it mostly just tastes like regular vegetables, but it's good. - Because you're kind of avoiding the red, goopy stuff. - Yeah, because the red, goopy stuff is insanely spicy. - You know, in Ethiopia, not eating the red, goopy stuff is extremely disrespectful. - Shit, really? - In fact, if you don't eat it, they might even ask us to leave. (Kyle coughs) - [Kyle] Oh god. - Kyle. (Evelyn giggles) - Oh god. - Oh Kyle. - I need a water. - Here, take mine, take mine! I was kidding. (Evelyn giggles) - Jesus! - Extremely disrespectful! Kyle, you need to lighten up. Oh no no, oh no no no no. Don't spit it out because now they really will ask us to leave. - Good, I'm ready to go! (Evelyn laughs) - Ziggy. - Yeah? - Are you happy? - What? - Are you happy? - Are you really asking me? - Of course. - Um, yeah, I mean, I think so. I mean, I'll have a good thought it my head, you know? Like, "You just wrote a lift song." And then later I'll be feeling bad about something, I mean, it could be anything, and the feeling doesn't feel good anymore. Does that make sense? Like I'll have a logically good thought but my feeling is still bad. And it kills me because it means that my thoughts and my feelings are disconnected and that I could be the most popular song writer in the world but it still won't solve any real problems. Because no matter what I do in this world, I'll always kind of have a lingering pain, yeah. - Hmm. - Why are you asking me? - Because I'm reading this fascinating article about teen suicide. It's highest in your specific age group. - Oh. - And you being white and upper middle class and educated, it's very high for people like you. - Okay, thanks Dad. - Do you want to read it? - No. - Mom's home! - [Evelyn] Hello, boys! - [Roger] I made a duck! - Oh, boo, I already ate. - You did? - Yes, but I'll sit with you, and I'll certainly have a glass of something. - I opened the Malbec, but it's not very good. - Oh stop it. Malbec's always good. - Hi Mom. - Hello, Ziggy. - Dad's reading a fascinating article about teen suicide. - [Roger] So what'd you eat for dinner? - I took Marci to the Ethiopian restaurant. It was her second year anniversary of working at the shelter and I wanted to do something nice for her. It was delicious. We ate with our hands and it was very interesting. - Yeah, I know, I love that place. - No you don't. - Of course I do, we used to go all the time. - Yeah and you told me it made you feel dirty. - It did, I had lentils and shit all over my hands but I still liked it. - I didn't realize. Maybe we can go back some time. - Yeah, sure, maybe. I don't know, I have to go upstairs and write a new song. I'm live streaming tomorrow, so. - Oh, don't worry. Dad and I'll clean up your plate. No no no, it's all right, I worked all day. I'll just come home and clean up after you, I don't mind. - What do you mean you worked all day? You just went out to fucking dinner. - [Roger] Ziggy, calm down. - Excuse me! I was with Marci. We were discussing a grant. It was work. - Yeah, I'm sure it was really important that you discussed a grant at a cool restaurant you used to take me to. - I don't have to defend myself to you, Ziggy. You're a child. - Yeah and you're a shitty mom. - Ziggy sit back down. - Shut up, Dad. Shut up Dad. - You're a wonderful son. I'm so very lucky! - You know what?! My songs make me more money than you'll ever see in your fucking lifetime. My songs reach more people than you could ever dream of reaching at your little shelter in Indiana. - Oh okay, yeah, go write your little teenage songs. ♪ Boys and girls, holding hands ♪ - Fuck off! Shut the fuck up, shut up! Shut up, Mom shut up! (Evelyn mockingly singing) I'm actually writing a song right now. It's a political song. - Oh yeah? - Yeah, and it's gonna be so political it's gonna change the fucking world and you're gonna be so embarrassed that you didn't think of it. - Ziggy, Ziggy, even if you wrote the best, most political-est song, I doubt I'm going to wish that I wrote it. - Just try to not make any noise. - Ev-- - I know, stop.

I'm gonna go down there. - [Roger] Do you want me to go for you? - No. (soft instrumental music) Hey there smarty pants. - Evelyn, hey, what are you doing here? - Oh silly me, I made too much food and I thought you might be hungry. - Thanks, I actually already ate though. - Oh, it's pot roast. - [Kyle] Yeah shit, sorry. My mom and I just ate a couple of hours ago. - Oh yes, of course, that makes sense. Well, I left some paperwork at the office and that's why I came in, primarily. - Well, yeah. Thank you, so yeah, thanks so much anyways. - Oh, I think we'll have some good news from Oberlin tomorrow, very exciting. (soft instrumental music) - I've secured two sponsorships, both for 10k from Hair Today and one from the Clifford Family. - Oh, well that's tremendous. Fred's never been particularly eager to part with his money. - [Cathy] But the downside is we're only half sold as of now. Sorry Evelyn. - Yeah, sorry. - Oh, no need to apologize. You're doing the best you can. - [Cathy] Last year at this year we were sold. - Don't be so hard on yourself. - I'm sorry I'm interrupting. - You all right Angie? - Um, can I talk to you for a second? - Oh, yes, yes of course. I shall return. - [Angie] I don't know how to tell you this. - Well, tell me what? - Well, it's about Kyle. - Oh, is he all right? Is he hurt? - No, he's fine. - Oh, good, oh don't scare me like that. - Kyle is going to be fine. - [Evelyn] No, I know that. - No, I don't think you do. - [Evelyn] No I do, he is an amazing kid, you're very lucky. - I'm lucky. I believe that Kyle has told you his plans on working with his father after he finishes school, at his father's shop? - The car repair shop. - [Angie] Right, the car repair shop. - Yes, we've been discussing that and I've been encouraging him to think outside the box a little bit. There are some wonderful programs where I think that Kyle would excel. He's very curious. He's unusually sensitive. - Yeah, I know that. - Of course you do. You're his mother. - Well, Kyle feels good working with his father. He already works weekends. He makes good money, and he feels good about himself and you're trying to push him into some place that's gonna make him feel stupid. - No one is going to make that boy feel anything less than brilliant, anything less than what he is. - Well, he feels good working with his father. Maybe not brilliant, but he feels good about himself. - Well, imagine how good, imagine how amazing he would feel with a college degree, with something that he had no expectation of ever getting. - I think he must feel pretty amazing when someone says, "Hey kid, you fixed my car. You're 17 years old and you fixed a car that hasn't turned over in a year. Now I can get to work on time and now I can pick my kids up from school." - Yes yes, and I'm sure that is a wonderful feeling. And that is exactly what I'm offering him, that feeling times a million. - Okay, well we don't want it. - You don't want it or does Kyle not want it? - Yeah, I don't want it. - [Cathy] I think we're gonna need that kind of space, yeah. I mean, it's a little echo-ey, but the biggest problem I'm having is Steven. He's like, texting me every five minutes. (soft chattering) (intense instrumental music) (car honking) (intense instrumental music) - [Secretary] Paging Kyle Marks. Would Kyle Marks please report to the office? I repeat, would Kyle Marks please report to the office? - Yo, shut up man. - Yo yo yo, how's it going everybody? Hey Lila. - Sit down, sit down troubadour! - Oh lift, cool. I don't want to interrupt anything. So what are you guys talking about? - Becky's thinking about getting her tongue pierced. - Which is obviously a terrible idea. - It's my tongue! - Uh-uh, not after you get it pierced. Then it's the world's tongue. - I just thought you guys would be talking about political stuff like you usually do. - It is political! It's my body! - It's an important muscle. You'll have no taste buds! - No, I just meant like, world politics. Cause Lila and I were kinda working on this song for the Marshall Islands. - Oh really? - Yeah, Ziggy did like, the weirdest possibly nicest thing. He took this poem I wrote and set it to music. - Yeah, that's actually why I came over here. I played it last night on Hi-Hat. That's where I have 20,00 followers and am validated and starred and everything. - [Cyril] You told us. - Oh, really? Oh, lift. Anyway, I don't really sing about political shit because I feel like people don't really like that stuff and also it doesn't really translate because of the language barrier. But I played the Marshall Islands song last night, right, and I got like 83 up-notes, which translates to like 90 bucks before Hi-Hat deductions. And it's so funny because you Lila, you said that I have a huge platform to be political, and I never really wanted to do that because I thought it would make me less money. But last night proves that I can both be political and make money. Isn't that awesome? - Kyle, hello! How are you dear? - I'm fine, what's up? - Oh, I have to speak to you, I'm sorry, oh forgive me. - It's cool. Is my mom okay? - Oh yes, Angie is fine. Actually, I don't know, I really-- - Wait, what happened? - I just spoke to her and she said that you and she had discussed what we've been working on together and I... I want to get some clarity on that situation. - Shit, I'm sorry about that. What did she say? - Well, she said that she was worried that you wouldn't fit in with the other students and that you wouldn't excel, and both you and I know that that could not be further from the truth. But I inferred from what she said to me that I may have overstepped, and if I have, I would be mortified. Frankly, I would be mortified! - She's been really emotional lately. I told her not to talk to you. - Okay, okay, well I understand. I mean, she's a good mother. She's a very concerned mother and we've all been there and it's a big change. I mean, not just for you but for your entire family. - Yeah, and what if I don't want it? - Don't want what? - School and all that? 'cause I don't think that I really wanna go. I'm sorry, I know you've been thinking about it a lot and that it's important to you. I talked to my dad and we all think it's a good idea if I start working with him more. - [Lila] Ziggy, do not follow me. - Lila, just explain to me what I did wrong! - Are you so fucking stupid? - Maybe I am? I thought you'd be proud! - Proud, how could I be proud? You exploited me. You exploited the fucking poor people in the Marshall islands, like they have any more reason to be miserable and you exploited yourself. - How the fuck did I exploit anyone? I wrote this killer fucking lift song with you! We wrote it together and I used it to raise awareness for a major world problem. - And then you have the audacity to brag about it to me like you're a fucking god. Changing the world takes doing real work and actually giving a shit about real people, you can't-- - Maybe I can change things! - You can't. - No maybe we can, like a team. - We're not a team, Ziggy! You're like a little boy! - [Evelyn] I know it's scary. We all have imposter syndrome. I understand that. I am constantly striving to have my character - match up to my ideals. - Okay Okay Okay Yeah. - No I understand. - It steels you. It strengthens you. It's the only way to learn and to grow, to live a more examined life, to make an impact. Don't you want that? - Yeah, I guess. - Yes, of course you do because that is what everyone wants. - I know, I just can't really think about it right now. - But right now is the time! Right now is the time you have to think about this. - Evelyn, just please stop! Please stop, stop, please stop! Please. I'm sorry. - Oh, no, no, no. - You're not gonna like, kick us out, right? - What? - Like if I don't go to college, you're not gonna make us leave, right? - Oh my god, oh my god, no. Kyle, these things are separate. These things are totally separate. - Thank you. Really, thank you Ms. Katz, 'cause my mom really feels safe there. - Well she is. She is very safe there and you are both very safe. (locker banging) - Oh, fuck! - 'Sup. (somber music) (keyboard clicking) Hey guys, TheRealZiggyKatz here! I just want to say happy Fourth, Fourth of July, or as we call it in America Independence Day, whatever that means. So right now I'm going to play a song called "Mouth of a Liar."

I just want to say Dobry Dzien and happy Wednesday to my friends in Minsk and Ni Hao and happy Thursday to my Tigers out in Liajing. Xie xie for waking up so early! And of course dhonnobad to all my devoted Chittagong gals. I'm glad to see the floods haven't affected your internet connections. You all look super clear and ready for a show!
