Caddying is more than just dragging a bag around and often determines the difference between a good game and a bad one. Most of us overlook the fact that good golf is a sort of partnership between the player and the caddie. ♪♪♪ Caddying used to be the guy who worked in the barn or worked in the kitchen. Carried the bag, that's all he did. Back in the day, they'd form a relationship with the person. And you were a team and you took great pride in it. It's not the easiest thing in the world to do but we do it because we love it. You need that help. I think a player needs that help, tremendously. The greatest golfers? The greatest of golf moments? Look again. A caddie standing right there. They don't just whisper advice from the shadows, they are the secret, integral part of the game. It's finally time for the story of the golf caddie to be told. I get up every morning and take my little dog for a walk. And then I'd return, have my couple of cups of coffee, some toast and then I go to work. Lovely. Let's go. My grandfather was, he was the Celt pro here back in the 40's, 50's. Then my father started caddying here. About maybe that time then I started caddying in 1975 and my son started caddying in the 90's. So, my son is the fourth generation of my family. My parents are buried right there. So, I always bless myself every morning passing them and this is where I'm going to finish up in my years. In here with all my family, ancestors. I just go down now and see what the bookings are and I'm pretty high up in the list. So, I expect to be one of the first caddies out this morning. I love this place. You meet different people every day from all over the world. It's fun. To acquire a local caddie at a foreign golf course is to have an ally in a battle against the elements, the golf course, and life itself. Give it a good 90-yard shot. - You can almost hit that pole. - Yeah. There is an old, familiar, somehow disparaging saying in golf that goes: There are only three rules for caddies: Show up, keep up, and shut up. Perfect. If the guy wants me to turn up and just shut up and all he wants is information that's what he's going to get. And if he wants to then talk about Scotland and stories of the caddies, he'll get that as well. Eh, will you go for a few beers tonight, huh, Bob? Well, I might try that. It's just that I'm not just his caddie, I'm also a very good friend of his... Of all of them, you know. It's really important, you spend a lot of time with that person. And you want that. You don't want to be like people who'd say, "Oh, carry clubs and shut up." You know, that's... that's not what you want. ♪♪♪ People share so much information with us and tell us all about their life. Maybe be like a hairdresser or you know a massage therapist or something. People think, you know, you guys must be talking about shots and how you hit them and... No. No. You, you would have a migraine that would be uncontrollable by the end of the round if you tried to stay that focused for five hours on the golf course. It would be all... it would be impossible to do. So, you talk about news, sports, girls, movies, we talk about anything and everything. This is my printing press. It's a bit out of action just now as a store, but I print my own stuff on history of golf. People ask when was the game of golf first played and nobody knows. Of course, there has been historically... very at times, bad-tempered discussion and argument between Europe and Scotland about who invented golf. The first record of golf is in 1474, when the king banned golf. Oh, well that sucks. What he wanted was the citizens to practice archery. Tensions with England were rising. He needed soldiers and infantry with skills in archery to beat the English. The greatest myth about caddies is that it has come from Mary Queen of Scots. I read it in every golf history book. She was the first lady golfer. She was great at the game. She transformed the game in Scotland. She's played every course in Scotland, you know. There's lots and lots more outlandish stories about her, but the primary one you will hear is that she came over from France, and brought over her cadet, you know, her caddie. Unfortunately, it's a myth. There is no record of Her Majesty posting any official scores. In fact, the only historical mention of Mary's golf game is a bizarre one. In 1567 Mary's house was blown up, and her husband, Lord Darnley, was found murdered in the yard. Oh, well. Mary's enemies, in a plot to force her off the throne, accused her of playing golf just days after her husband's death. If true, certainly a testament to the lady's focus and competitive fire. What they said was that she was clearly so relaxed and not in mourning and, obviously, complicit in the murder of her husband that she was off playing golf. And it was used as part of the reasons to have her executed. Before we do this... By the 1700s, the word caddie was used for porters. And they would carry the bags of strangers, find a hotel, and, in particular, would get them to where there was eating, drinking, and womanizing to be obtained. The golfers then began using them not just for general pottering and delivering duties, but also for looking for their golf balls. One of many Scottish golf hazards is its tall thick grass. Caddies first became integral to the game by knowing where to find a golfer's balls. They used to use what are called feathery golf balls and these balls were very expensive. Found it! But the caddies were an unruly bunch, unkempt, frequently drunk, more curse words than any other words in a sentence. They were the lower classes. Tom Morris born in the poorest part of St. Andrews was a caddie who became the greatest golfer of his era, but his circle of friends, his environment, everything is caddies. You know that's his class, that's his people. So, in 1864, Tom Morris was pretty in charge of the caddies. It was a code of conduct. You had to be over eleven years old. You also had to go to Sunday school, no drinking. So, you can see Tom Morris's influence. So, from 1890 onwards, there was actually an appointed person to look after the caddies and we have to this day, we got a caddie master. ♪♪♪ Thirtieth of this month is the opening day. So, I'm hoping I'm going to see some of you guys here at 9 o'clock, opening day, ready to caddie. The role of caddie master's been going on for more than 160 years. You can find a shining example when you go to Cleveland, Ohio. Canterbury Golf Club has hosted the rotating five major championships in professional golf, one of only two clubs to do so. And if you go there, and go to the bag-room, go to the range, go to the putting green, there you're going to find Mike Kiely. For more than a half century, he's been there as a great example of a caddie master. I started carrying golf bags when I was ten years old and before I was ten my dad had me hitting golf balls when I was six or eight years old. My family is a third generation. Started out with my two brothers and two brothers-in-law's, years later my kids, and now their kids are working here. I estimated about four thousand caddies they've gone through the caddie program at Canterbury. I don't care if you're teaching a kid to caddie or teaching them how to play golf just being yourself, being honest, being polite and courteous. The caddie only takes care of himself if you have those qualities. I started caddying here when I was in seventh grade and I caddied at a couple of places around town and never really kind of found my way. And my dad was you know, very much aware of Mike Kiely and the program that he had built here. My goal is to always work in the bag-room because I wanted to be Mike's right-hand man. I spent more time with Mike in the summertime than I did with my own folks. Mike was definitely a father figure. My first impression of Mike Kiely was "Is this guy crazy?" But my grandpa actually died that year and he was best friends with him. They went to the same parish. And through the whole summer we just became almost like family. It's not easy. There's a learning process that's involved with it. Everybody says it comes around full swing in the end. It's one big loop, is the big adage. When I find a kid that wants to work and wants to caddie, I'll keep that kid busy. Because at Canterbury most of the people want to walk because the game of golf is meant to walk. A links golf course is a golf course built on dunes of sand. If you're going to play a links golf course you must hire a caddie. I guarantee you, you put Americans out here without a caddie and they put the ball in the rough down the right. You cannot trust your eye on a links golf course if you haven't been used to it. That's ten-thousand-year-old sand, you know, compacted. It's okay there, mate. It's okay. So, it's quite an art to that as you can imagine. My home course is actually a link style course that I play back in Minnesota and it's nothing like this. I mean the vegetation tries to replicate this, but once you're in the rough here, you're in the rough. Links golf requires an unbelievable imagination and it requires an unbelievable amount of knowledge from the caddie as far as where the wind's going, how far is the ball going to run down, when what clubbers are going to be into the wind. A good caddie assesses his players' swing in the first few holes, in order to suggest or pull the correct club for each situation. I am a member here, so I know the course pretty well. Yeah. The modern caddie must be ready to offer yardage, the exact distance between wherever the ball lays and the next target of the hole, most often the flagstick. Tee off on the left side. - And maybe aim for like the left side of the bunker. - Okay. - Oh it's going to be nice. - Nice shot. That's a golf shot. Our lad or lassie must be able to read greens. That is know how fast the ball will roll on the putting surface and how to compensate for the slopes. But it's only advice and we all know about taking advice. The golfer is still the one who must make the shot. You see the caddie should be more than just a psychologist, a father, a mother figure, you know. You got to do the whole thing. He's got to do a proper job here and they don't last long if they don't. I'll tell you that. I really had not liked links golf at all. In fact, I hated links golf. I played American style. I played the ball way up in the air. I expected the ball to stop pretty close to where it landed. Links golf, it doesn't do that. My very first shot in links golf, I hit it right down in the middle a fairway, it ended up in a pot bunker seventy-five yards off the center of fairway area. I didn't like that. Even at the highest level of professional tour-golf, hiring a local caddie has yielded indisputable results. I had a caddie by the name of Alfie Fyles. He was a character, he was from Southport, near Birkdale. That's where he grew up. He loved to smoke unfiltered cigarettes and drink Famous Grouse. But I hope it kicks left hard. American tour-golfer Tom Watson with the guidance of native caddie Alfie Fyles racked up five British Open wins in just nine years. You form a relationship with the person and you were a team and you took great pride in it. On this side of the hazard, known as the Atlantic Ocean, plenty of attempts have been made to replicate links courses. Maybe nothing comes closer than Bandon Dunes. If you look at any list of you know the best courses in the world they're almost all on sand most of them on the ocean and this site in Bandon matched both. I think a lot of people thought he was crazy when he said he was going to build you know a world-class golf resort, here in Bandon, Oregon. When people in the town heard that there was a golf course being put in out here, people were like it's not gonna do well because it's in the middle of nowhere tons of sand dunes, course, you name it. Well, a lot of people in town didn't realize that that's what links golf is. All the experts said, "You are crazy. You're going to have carts of course." So they said, "If you make it walking only, Americans won't play unless they're carts." And how are we going to get caddies to go to Bandon, Oregon? Where are they going to live? Where are they going to come from? You know it's like that movie Field of Dreams. If you build it, they will come and that's what people are doing. Beauty. Walking is really, really, really, part of a golf game. If I had the choice of a cart or a caddie, I will take a caddie. Being on dunes, being on links course, we definitely have to play a lot more ground game shots and the wind is also a big factor out here. Most guys that come out here aren't used to playing in 30-mile-an-hour-plus winds. So, us being out here every day, we can kind of know what type of shots to play for the guys. If you break it down, the caddie spends the most time with the guests. Guest comes to play 36 holes for three days and they spend all that time with their caddie, who quickly becomes their best friend for the moment. In particular, I want them to be the happiest people at the resort, other than maybe their guest. And that's sort of my pro-caddie philosophy. An 18-hole round is... Here we call it a loop. So, we call ourselves "loopers.'" European caddies are the best. They would rather get off a great line than get their tip. You know what I mean? If it's like, "Should I say this, or should I go ahead and get a good tip?" And they'll go, "I'm saying this." We were with this guy. He had a terrible temper. And he 3-putted one of those big greens out there and it had been his like fifth or sixth three-putts. And he goes, "You know what? I'd rather go back to my room and find my wife with another guy than three put another green out here." And one of the Scottish caddies goes, "What's your room number?" I think that a lot of people when they go to Scotland and Ireland, they love the fact that the caddie was drunk, you know. They'll always talk about how the caddie was gruff and maybe rude, not to say that the Scottish guys aren't professional because I am Scottish and I would say I'm professional. Let me tell you something, there's two things that a caddie doesn't care about. Breasts on a man and what you shoot. He just wants you to have fun and enjoy golf and maybe you learn something. By the 1890s golf was expanding in America and club making had become a legitimate career. Scottish club makers also doubled as caddies and were coveted by Americans for their skills and ties to golf history. The Carnoustie 300 refers to a group of club makers, caddies, greens keepers, golf teachers, and course designers who migrated from Carnoustie, Scotland, to the United States. The United States was the land of opportunity and imagine the joy of going out somewhere in California to work, for example, compared with a February in Carnoustie. There's just no competition here, a nice job, well paid, and a lovely climate to work in and when they got out here they were equipped more than us here, being as it were. Scottish caddies may have been highly regarded in the U.S. but at home under the old British class system, they were still considered at the bottom of society. I know, for example, certain people that are caddying here just now, and I remember their mums and dads and maybe actually to this day, a bit disappointed that their son is caddying. The Royal and Ancient Golf lub was founded in 1754 and the inks which overlook the sea are amongst the finest in the world but you golfers won't deny that the proof is in the putty. St. Andrews has held twenty-nine Open Championships more than any other golf course. So it's been in the forefront of championship golf through the last century and a half almost. So, any golfer that has any sense of golf as a worldwide phenomenon associates it with St. Andrews first and foremost in the old course. Everything in this town is for golf, you know whether it's hotels, restaurants, everything. If you visited here twenty years ago or a hundred years ago, the course really hasn't changed very much. So, you're playing the same course Arnold Palmer played, that Seve Ballesteros played, that James Braid played, that Bobby Jones played. That's the joy of it. I find and I always hit the ball better if my backswing is very leisurely. Born in Atlanta in 1902, as a young boy Bobby Jones battled health issues and golf was prescribed to strengthen him. Jones trained at Atlanta Athletic Club with Stewart Maiden, formerly of Carnoustie, Scotland and one of the famed Carnoustie 300. Beginning in 1923, Jones dominated top-level amateur competition. And in 1930 he completed the Grand Slam, besting amateurs and professionals alike by winning all four of the major golf championships in the same calendar year. But he still remained an amateur, paying his own travel expenses to Scotland to win the Open. Bobby Jones definitely was an adopted son of St. Andrews and I think it was a relationship that was mutual. I think he grew to love the place with an absolute passion. It's really a great treat to play before a gathering that understands the job and appreciates the difficulties under which the players live. Thank you very much. The 10th hole is named after him here in St. Andrews. So a great man, a great man indeed. Bobby Jones retired from competitive golf at the age of twenty-eight but returned to America a national hero. "Championship golf is something like a cage," Jones said, "First, you're expected to get in and then you're expected to stay there." Jones returned to Atlanta, Georgia, with a dream of building his own golf course and hosting his own tournament. Cliff Roberts made a lot of money at Wall Street and they became friends because of Jones' notoriety as a golfer and Cliff Roberts' interests in the game. Cliff Roberts found the property, showed it to Bobby Jones, they liked it, and that's where the dream came from. Construction of the Augusta National Golf Course began in 1931. Locals were hired to clear and grade the land and among them was Willy "Pappy" Stokes. They're tearing down trees, running plows, and when it rained, Pappy would sit there and watch the rain come down the hillsides. By watching the rain, Pappy had discovered an invaluable secret that no matter where a golfer was on the course, all putts tended to break towards Rae's Creek, the lowest point of Augusta. In 1934, the year Bobby Jones launched the inaugural Masters tournament, Pappy Stokes stayed on as a caddie. At only seventeen years of age and harboring the secret of Rae's Creek, Pappy guided Henry Picard to his first Masters win in 1938. And here comes the putt that may lead to victory. Pappy would, eventually, win five different Masters tournaments on the bag with four different champions. Pappy Stokes started the Augusta National Caddie Corps and as the guide Ben Crenshaw called him "the godfather of the caddies."” Caddies were not thought of as the greatest citizens in the world, but these guys were chosen from the neighborhoods surrounding Augusta National. I think a lot of them did it out of necessity. I started caddying at eleven years old in Augusta Country Club. My mother and father at the time was working at the King Mill. They were only making fifteen, sixteen dollars a week and me making three dollars a day. That was a lot of money during that time. I was a fifth-grader. After school I could get over to the Augusta Country Club in ten minutes walking, we could shag balls and that's how I made some extra money to share some of that with my mother. Pappy Stokes gave us caddie schools every Saturday morning. He teaches how to read greens, how to stand around the members, and the etiquette and everything about it. Pappy taught these guys how to not only to caddie, but how to behave, how to interact with the player. It wasn't always important to read putts and to pull clubs but you had to understand the mindset of the player. You had to understand when he was down, how to pick him up. We were the best catchers in the world, and we challenged each other, who could read the greens the best, who could pull the best clubs, and all that stuff. In the 1960s as professional and amateur golfers would arrive for the tournament, the caddie master would match a player with one of the golf clubs' in-house caddies. This was a unique skill and golfers soon came to request. "The same caddie as last year, please?" Golf became a way to make a living first when Arnold Palmer came on the scene, and television came on the scene in the late fifties, early sixties. He was a handsome guy. TV loved his magnetism. Arnold brought golf to the truck drivers and the plumbers. I can remember my mother watching golf for the first time on TV because "He's just so handsome, isn't he?" You know, the shirt would come untucked, with big arms. When it came to the Masters, the Augusta National's caddie master assigned, a sixteen-year-old Nathaniel "Iron Man" Avery to be Arnold Palmer's caddie. He got the name "Iron Man" because he blew three of his fingers off with a firecracker. He must probably think he was an Iron Man or something. That's how as a kid he blew a couple of his fingers off. Nineteen sixty Palmer's coming down the stretch to win the Masters. Palmer fails the chip shot, tosses his club at the golf bag. Iron Man looks at Arnold Palmer, says "Mr. Palmer, are we choking?" Palmer says that he felt like Iron Man was his father from years ago giving him a hard time for not acting properly on the golf course. He caddied for all four of Arnold Palmer's Masters wins. Willie Peterson was a guy that would stick his head in the Caddyshack at Augusta National and make five or six wagers that Jack Nicklaus was going to shoot sixty-five that day. Nicklaus was a stoic when he played. Willie was exact opposite. He was boastful, he was loud, he was rambunctious, and so, they played-off each other as opposite personalities, but, yet, they worked together so nicely. Willie Peterson caddied for Jack in five of his six Masters wins and Nathaniel Avery, Iron Man caddied for all four of Arnold Palmer's Masters wins. These guys played such an instrumental role in the players winning the tournament and television ratings went up, purses went up. Caddies were making more of a percentage working for guys, the caddie ranks go right up with the player ranks. As TV began to popularize the sport a new breed of freelance caddie was born. The Pro Jock. I remember in 1970, we would take the Greyhound to each tournament. I had a custom van that I fixed up with abed and a cooler and this and that sort. I made some friends quickly out there. You know you used to have to have two or three or four guys to a room just to break even or to make it. In 1971 when we were coming to a golf course, these guys jumped out of a car and they put a knife to our throats and they said, "If you show up tomorrow with your long hair, we're gonna take care of you." So, the next day, we showed up with a beanie hat on, with our hair up in the beanie hat. That's how tough it was back then. I kind of miss some of the old days. There used to be an old caddie and he walked with a limp and besides he didn't have a limp. And then you find out he kept all his money in his left shoe. If things were going good like, "Oh, he's got his limp back. It's going good." Driven by the lure of a fifteen-hundred-dollar weekly salary and up to ten percent of a player's winnings, the freelance caddie, the pro jock was in full flower by the end of the 1970s. As far as having a plan when I got to Augusta, I had no plan. When Fuzzy Zoeller qualified for his first Masters Tournament in 1979, The Augusta National still required players to use its caddies. That was the rule. You couldn't bring your caddie from the PGA Tour. You had one of the Augusta National Caddies as your caddie. So, he comes and gets Jerry Beard. I said who is Fuzzy Zoeller? So, I asked Mike, I said, "Mike, can this guy really play?" He said, "He can play. Trust me. Trust me. He can play." Fuzzy Zoeller had absolutely no idea how to play it. He listened to Jerry Beard, gave him the right club, how to putt. He told me where to hit it, where not to hit it. It was like a blind man with a seeing eye dog. He led me around that golf course. Fuzzy tell me, "Come on now, highball Tom Watson out right here on this hole." He hit the biggest drive we had all week. We had a hundred and thirty-six yards to the hole. He said, "What do you like?" I said, "Nothing but a picture with. He said, "Well, probably you know what? I hit the best knock down hit iron in the world." I said, "Well, do your thing." And he hits it in there may be about ten, twelve feet. So, first I say what it does I says about four inches right and don't leave a show. No way! A first year Masters player wins without a local caddie and by the way nobody has since. No first year Masters player has won and a lot of it is because they don't use the local caddies. While caddies were recognized as an undeniable asset to competitive golf, the social class system still lingered. Golfers and caddies were still separated by an unspoken line. We were not allowed in the clubhouse. We were in the caddie pen that's where you better stay. Boy, you stay in the caddie pen. Caddying used to be a tad amount of being the guy who worked in the barn or worked in the kitchen. Uh, they weren't very well thought of. They just carried the bag, that's all they did. Club caddies who wanted to play on their home course could only play once a week on the day the club was closed to members and often with limited access to holes. We had some good caddies that could really play. We had guys like Jim Dent who went to the regular tour and played golf, Senior Tour and played and did very well on Senior Tour. Henry Brown. These guys were great players. You know when I started the tour, we had over two dozen blacks and Hispanics, playing the tour. Where do you think these guys came from? They came from the caddie ranks. Dent, Elder, Me, Sifford, Thorpe, they all came from the caddie ranks. Not bragging right now at seventy-four years old, I still can break eighty, you know, I can break eighty. First time I played golf ever, was this tee box right here. That was just a little bit farther than I hit it the first time. Greg Puga was born in East LA and honed his golf skills on public courses. A world away from the members" only private clubs he'd seen on television. His journey as a caddie was born from his desire to compete as a golfer at the highest level. I played Pop Warner Football since I was nine, baseball, but what upset me was that if I would play my best, we could still lose the game. If I sat on the bench all game and we won that didn't feel fulfilling. That's why I love golf. There's just no excuse. You either play well or you don't. - Let's go, daddy. - Let's go. My high school didn't have a golf team. So, my math teacher, Paul Isozaki it was just natural for me to ask him, if he wanted to start a golf program because I wanted to play high school golf. I'm an average golfer or maybe not even that. So, all our team basically were just beginners. I mean they were like my friends you know, the guys from the football team and I just got whoever I could. "Hey, you guys want to go play golf?" Roosevelt High School is in East LA. The community is Boyle Heights. That was when it was this gang infested area and when I used to drive them home and drop them off, the gangsters would drive next to me and you know, eye me out and it was not pretty. My mom started taking me to the driving range almost every day. And I'd want to finish my homework as soon as I could so I could come and practice. And then when I figured out that I couldn't get better I realized I wanted golf lessons. It was a big expense for my mom and dad. They told me a hundred dollars. That's all I can afford. You know do your job. So, he said, what do you think? And I said, "Well, he's got some talent and he's got a good attitude."” I said, "You just send him, and I will work with him anytime." I didn't have access to country clubs, you know because we didn't have money to be a member. I found out that by caddying we get to play there on Mondays. I figured, "Hey, I could caddie there and play" and get used to the conditions of tournament playing. Golf is a game of privilege. I mean if you were to grow up in a country club, you're going to be able to play all the golf you want, hit all the balls you want, play thirty-six a day. I mean if you are rich, golf is a great sport to learn. But if you don't have that it's really hard to become a great player. Twenty-nine-year-old Greg Puga from Los Angeles started off almost holing it out on one, but par was good enough for a one up lead. I did a lot of amateur qualifiers and things like that. And I finally qualified for the mid-am. Puga closed out the match easily on seventeen to win this National Championship, three-in-one. To qualify to play in the mid-amateur and then go ahead and win it and beat some of the best amateur players in the country and the world. To do that it's a remarkable feat. By winning the US mid-am, I got an invitation to the Masters. That's when I finally said, "Yeah, I'm going to Augusta," you know? To come from Boyle Heights to the Masters as a caddie I mean that's just Cinderella story. I mean it really is the Cinderella story, Greg Puga. At that time when he was there at the Masters no one... That a dude from our caddie yard is out there at Augusta playing right now, was cool as hell. Everybody was excited, and a bunch of caddies and a bunch of members went down there to support him. I got to play with Ben Crenshaw, the last nine holes of the practice round. I got to meet Carl Jackson. Carl was talking to me about certain holes and giving me certain strategies and stuff. I mean to be just with Ben Crenshaw alone on the back night of Augusta that was pretty cool. It wouldn't have been as big a deal for someone who grew up like Jack Nicklaus at a private club and had all the advantages. Greg wasn't given any equipment; He wasn't being fed freebies and all stuff like that. He played public golf courses. It's one of the great achievements in golf, what he managed to do. And I take a little credit but it's mostly what the player does. To me that was the best tournament of the whole year. A caddie playing in the Masters. I mean it was on the front page every day. He's a caddie at Bel-Air Country Club now, and some guys don't know it. They're going like, "I think I need to hit an eight here, Greg." I can do it.” And this guy is on his way to a hundred and twenty. Meanwhile, on Monday, Greg shot sixty-six, you know. So, and Greg never says a word. But it's extra special having a caddy on the valley that's played in the Masters. So, you don't really get that all too often. Well, back when I first started the way the caddies got jobs were to wait in the parking lots for the pros to show up and ask them if they could caddie that week. Most of my jobs came out of a parking lot. I said, "Tell you what? My main focus is for you to make it." If you make it, I make money. "If you don't, I don't make money." You could lose money and you did lose money a lot of weeks, but we did it back then for the love of the game. I showed up in 1973 to do the parking lot in St. Louis there and here comes a long-haired kid and he said "Could I caddie for you?" And I said, "Sure, I'll give you a shot." And I indoctrinated him very quickly. Bruce Edwards understood what made him tick. He could give him some criticism and Tom Watson would say, "Okay I understand." That week he did everything I asked him to do. And at the end of the round Bruce said, "Well, could I caddie for you the rest of the year?" And I said, "Hold on here. Let's just go one week at a time. You can caddie for me next week." Well, that one week at a time lasted for well over 20 years. I think Bruce was the first professional caddie who wanted to make it his life's work. He wanted to be out there with Tom in the battle, every week. As a teenager Bruce Edwards had a dream of one day caddying at the Masters but Augusta National still required players to use its caddies. Bruce Edwards watched from home while his loop, Tom Watson won the 1977 and 1981 Masters with Leon McCladdie on the bag. The 1982 tournament had a rainstorm one day and it delayed play and finally play was postponed to the following morning. A lot of Augusta National caddies did not get word the next morning of what time play was going to resume. And so a handful of players were left without a caddie when play was ready to start. A group of golfers, including Tom Watson, used the opportunity to appeal to Augusta National, asking that the ban on outside caddies be permanently lifted. Augusta agreed to let the golfers bring their own caddies beginning in 1983, allowing Bruce and Tom to work together, but leaving many of the trusted Augusta caddies out of the tournament. Many of the players thought that since this is a major championship that we ought to have our own caddies simply because our own caddies know us better than the caddies do here. It's something I've been looking forward to since I was thirteen years old. The Augusta National caddie lived for the Masters to make enough money to tie them over during the summer. It devastated a lot of them because they couldn't make any money. Bruce Edwards set a new standard for professional Tour caddies. He maintained a relationship with Tom Watson that spanned thirty years. Even after being diagnosed with ALS in 2003 Bruce and Tom continued to work together while Tom paid Bruce's medical bills. He's the big brother I never had. He taught me a lot on how to deal with the success, how to deal with failure and to hang in there and carry on and get through the rough times and that's all I know and that's because of Tom Watson. Bruce Edwards passed away on April 8, 2004, in a twist of fate on the first day of the Masters, the tournament that he and Tom had loved so much. He loved the Masters. He was there to watch me, he followed me and there was just a little extra oomph in his step that week being at Augusta, you could always tell. I said to myself, "Carl, if you think you a good caddie, you could... you're about to find out what you can do because this guy could hit it where he's looking." Ben Crenshaw was introduced to Carl Jackson at the 1976 Masters and placed second that year behind Raymond Floyd. Caddies and a player have to mesh personality-wise. They have to have that sort of intrinsic something that you can't define, and we hit it off. Carl is a very soft-spoken guy. He doesn't shout commands, but I can tell when he's serious. I can tell when he wants me to calm down because if you pull some shots off, you get very, very high. After winning their first Masters together in 1984 Ben Crenshaw would continue to return to the Masters and team with Carl Jackson in pursuit of another win. Ben made me a part of his game deep into his game. I feel like I won, too. So many years after that we had chances, close chances. We've been low a million times out there. So, he's gotten me going in a lot of instances, too. Ben and Carl won their first Masters in 1984. A little over a decade later they would once again be contenders. But just days before the tournament began Ben was shaken by the loss of his coach, friend, and mentor, Harvey Penick. Ben has to go to the funeral in Texas early in the week of the Masters Tournament so this is obviously going to be something that's going to keep him from playing well. Well, he's hitting balls on the practice facility and sort of shaking his head because he's not hitting it very well and Carl, who never does this, interjects. He says, "Why don't you move the ball a little bit forward in your stance and make a tighter turn on your golf swing and that might work." Although Carl had solved Ben's swing issue Ben was emotionally drained over the loss of Harvey Penick. Still on the final day, he came to the 18th hole with a narrow two-stroke lead. They love it. Before he could hit his second shot the spectators are congratulating him. He had broken his concentration. He looked at me and said, "Come on buddy, we got a couple of more good shots to play here."” You get out there in the heat of things and you'll be surprised how you go blank. There's a lot of pressure to have your guy perform and it's so emotional. That's when you really mesh as one because you don't want the wrong thing said. The toughest part of this job is the psychology of it. It's knowing when to speak up and how to speak up with the right verbiage and the right tone to set a different stage for your player. On the 18th hole the great putter needed to drop a two-footer to win his second Masters, eleven years after his first one. Golf cannot be a complete journey unless you have someone at your side. And to have somebody like Carl, at a place like that I could not have accomplished what I accomplished over there without Carl. Pebble Beach hosted the US Amateur Championship in 1929. Although Bobby Jones was eliminated in early match play his very attendance thrust Pebble Beach into the international spotlight. It's fabled. It's historic. It's legendary. But the best part about it is on one of the most unbelievably spectacular pieces of earth that God ever created. Frequented by celebrities, professionals, politicians, and the sight of many historic moments in golf, Pebble Beach has the distinct designation as being a Golf Resort, not an exclusive club. The caddies are there to serve the general public. The one thing here at Pebble Beach is they want to have an experience. And the caddie is one of the biggest parts of the experiences here. They might be a 20 handicapper or something. So, I might tell them that well I'm a pretty good golfer. I play a lot of amateur golf and I can help you; You know. And then after a couple of holes they can tell that, and they'll trust you. And that's a big part of the experience is having a good time and the trust you develop between the player and the caddie. This may be the one and only time they will ever play here. You just really want to make it special. I've had terminal people that they want to be the last round of golf. You know I was on the tee one day on 18, and the player that I got, he was standing there and just gazing around and finally said, "I've been waiting fifty years to stand on this tee."” Then I thought, I get to come out here every day and then they give me money at the end, how lucky am I? I think it's like anywhere from the 6-5 iron just hit a little cut, get it up there dish. I would like the 3-wood. - 3-wood? Well, yeah. - Because it will cut. I don't know if you got that shot. A pro caddie, on the other hand, you have to have everything down to the yard and the pros are... You know, they're, they're really critical. If you're on the... say 72nd hole of a tournament and your player says to you, do you like 4-iron or 3-iron? You better be right, you know. It's not a guessing game. You, you have to know your players game, you know, how far he can hit each iron. I've seen a lot of resort caddies not do well with pros. It's a whole different game. It's competitive. Major championships are really hard on caddies. They are long weeks. There's a lot of pressure on you. It's hard on your family, if you're married and have children because I mean, some years, we're gone thirty-five, thirty-eight weeks a year. Didn't really want to do the traveling. I like going to home to my wife. I have a great son. That's a great way to make a living if you make the cut, but it's not always that easy. June was forty-four years. I started here in June of '71 and I just I love coming to work, nine times out of ten. I've been caddying for about forty-four years. It was in my blood. I absolutely love caddying. God's country, Pebble Beach. Nick Faldo. Renowned for his single-minded dedication to golf, Nick Faldo was a perfectionist with a reputation for being very demanding to work for. In 1989, Fanny Sunesson was the only female caddie on the tour and renowned for her dedication to golf and also the reputation as a perfectionist. She came to Europe in the mid-eighties. She was caddying for other players and so, I got to know her. And I was having a rough time with my guy, you know. We weren't communicating and all that sort of thing. And I said, "I want to talk to you about something. I'm going to buy you dinner." - I said, "Order a spaghetti bolognaise at the hotel. - - the other side of the park." He was number one in the world, had won five tournaments, and he said, "I'm thinking about changing caddy and you're number one on my list." Well, I ran back to my little hotel around the corner from the players hotel and called my parents. And my dad answered, and I said, "Dad, dad. Nick Faldo wants me to work for him." So, she's says, "Oh, wow! Yeah, that's great. What about... what's the schedule?" I said, "Well, I don't know yet. So, I'll see, I'll see you in the morning for breakfast." So, then meet her the next morning, go whoop. I just gave her... I said, "All right that's the schedule for next year, girl. Off we go." That's it. Final 71 and Nick Faldo is the Open Champion. A quick kiss for caddie Fanny Sunesson. Fanny and Nick won the Masters and British Open their first year together. And fans would soon shower her with applause equal to Faldo's. Well, we didn't realize it, the weight behind us, it was creating, at all. Honestly, didn't. Suddenly I'm trying to become world number one and Masters champion blah, blah, blah, and I've got a lady caddy. Fortunately, to me and to Fanny that was the great thing. It was like so what? I think in the beginning when I started, no one wanted me because I was a girl. And I think, I had to work harder maybe to prove myself, but I'm a hard worker anyway. So, I didn't think of it that way. Well, Fanny is the hardest working caddie that's every caddied. There's absolutely no one's worked harder as a caddie. She was as true a professional as there ever was. Well, she had to be because she caddied for him. She was one of the greatest psychologists that there was on the golf course because she understands not just the mental side of caddying but the mental side of golfing too. If I hadn't caddied all those years, I wouldn't have the knowledge and experience that I have. And I think I use experience from caddying every day. Golf has seen many changes over the years but maybe none greater than when this young fellow took the stage. The biggest change was Tiger. Tiger put more money in their pockets than anybody. All of a sudden here's Tiger, here's the guy who's diverse. He's not white guy wearing a white golf shirt and khaki. He's bold, he's going for it. He hits the ball a long way. He's affiliated with Nike. He's never been involved with golf before. People that don't know anything about golf are all of a sudden attracted to the sport. I guess, hello world, huh? When Tiger became pro and the purses went big and it became a more glamorous profession. Now, everybody wanted to jump in and they think we have the greatest jobs in the life. Tiger just doubled everything. Doubled the crowds, doubled the money, and, consequently, doubled the money for caddies. Bring it in there. When Tiger Woods turned pro, he chose Michael "Fluff" Cowan for his professional debut at the 1996 Greater Milwaukee Open. Fluff was the most famous caddie in the world at the time because he was such a character. And so, Tiger wanted Fluff. The duo went on to win seven PGA Tour victories, but after just two and a half years Tiger broke it off with Fluff. Lo and behold, two or three days later I had a phone call and I thought it was my mate calling because he can do Tiger's accent to a tee. So, first time I put the phone down. Second time it rings again and I was with my friend Bob, and I said, "Bob, da-da-da-da-da." Put the phone down. The third time and I got to thinking maybe it's not Bob. Well it wasn't, it was Tiger Woods. So, we got off to a good start there and very quickly he started winning Majors at a very fast rate. We liked having fun, we were both driven, you know. We both had a no-lose attitude, I guess you could call it. So, you know it became a very good partnership. This duo quickly began to rack up championships and Steve became one of the best-known caddies in the business. In Tiger's heyday, Steve Williams was caddying for him one year, when Tiger had such a great year, Steve Williams was the highest-paid athlete in New Zealand. Tiger and Steve achieved unprecedented success and became close on and off the golf course. Yeah, well we became very great mates. I considered Tiger one of my best mates. And I think he considered me one of his best mates. He was best man at my wedding. I went to his wedding and so forth. You know, it's good when you get two people with a strong will, strong determination, it provides a great relationship. It was you know, particularly, on the mental side of it. Williams was renowned or his tough-minded caddying which sometimes got him into trouble like the time he took a spectator's camera and heaved it into a pond after the fan took a photograph in Tiger's backswing. You know, I don't know if bouncer is that word that I'd like to use, but a lot of people thought that I might have been enforcing things that maybe should have been out of my control. But I was trying to give Tiger the exact same playing field as every other player. But in 2011, a partnership which had set a high bar came to an end when Tiger fired Steve Williams. Steve was Tiger's caddie for thirteen of his fourteen Major Championship victories. If I turned the nine, I could side sauce right back in there. Again yeah, but you can do it but the thing we can't control is if it catches the wind downwards it's hooking and going. - Yeah, I'd like it to be... - You're coming in hot. You're really involved in million-dollar decisions. I mean, if you make the right decision and your player wins a golf tournament, they win a million dollars. Coming right at it. Oh! That had conversation and that shot was perfect. - In the caddie-player hall of fame, right there. - Yeah, no question. Caddying has become a profession into itself. You can make a great living if you get the right player. This past year when Jordan Spieth had such success Michael Greller made well over a million dollars that year just based on Jordan's winnings. Caddies today that are caddying the tour, they're all college graduates. They're well educated. You think thirty years ago caddies had financial advisors? Thirty years ago caddies is like, "Hey, man get gray out of the bush. Tell him we're ready to go." Yeah, the other prize money grew, and the structure of the tour grew. The difficulty of the golf courses and then the professionalism needed to increase from a caddie's point of view. So then it became a bit of more of a job. As late as 1993 I can remember first place in a tournament, we played in on tour was $54,000, first place. And now it's 1.6 million or 1.3 million or whatever like that. You know you have a tax guy. You know, you got money managers and stuff. It's a business now and guys treat it as such. You could see the change coming when the pros could bring in their own caddies. I guess that's good economics, but you know, you just don't... You just can't go out and get a bag anymore. You could go to the parking lot in 1990 and pick up four or five different bags and great people and great players but not anymore. I remember when I first started caddying, there was no carts and there's 300 caddies fighting for a bag, you know. And if I got a bag, I was the happiest kid in the world. When I first started, I got three dollars a bag. Three. But then they bumped it to three fifty. And then they bumped it to four. So, the money got out of control. It almost got away from me. For myself I learned a lot about how you're supposed to treat people. It's a great education. For me it was a great education and I'm very lucky to have some great schools that I went to. I went to the Second City in Chicago. I went to Saturday Night Live. I went to National Lampoon and I was a caddie. And they were all a big part of whatever I became. There's Chick Evans here. Chick the first amateur to win the National Amateur and the National Open. He's also the founder of the Evans Scholar Foundation. And I guess you know my boy here. Now look for a novelty today, looks to confine this to 18 holes. - Dad. - Don't dig any extra ones. I don't want any small talk, just stand there and learn something. Son, pick up that ball and follow me. Chick Evans was a great amateur golfer and he made a phonograph lesson. Made some pretty good money, but he can't take the money or else he loses his amateur status. So his mother said, "Why don't you give it away?" So, his idea of giving it away was to start a scholarship program for caddies. It was a way for kids who couldn't go to college because they couldn't afford to go to some of the Midwestern clubs and caddie and, therefore, they would get a college scholarship. I'd like to find a caddie who didn't have the experience that the kid from Ignatius had or the kid that went to US or Gilmore. I'd like to find a good one that went to the public-school system. The only way he's going to get to go to college is because of the Evans Scholarship. I'm applying for the Evans Scholarship, obviously, for financial reasons but working on my service. I do the caddying. My cousin actually got a scholarship, too. So, it's kind of been a dream of mine ever since I learned about it. I always took a little extra time and go out of my way to work with those young boys or girls. The Evans Scholarship raises more than sixty million dollars a year from more than twenty-seven thousand donors. Oil and gas man, George Solich and his brother Geoff, established the Solich Caddie and Leadership Academy to help optimize a candidate's chances of receiving the Evans scholarship. Getting the Evans scholarship changed the entire course of my life. We wanted to provide that opportunity for as many kids as we possibly could. We thought that the Solich Caddie and Leadership Academies would be a great opportunity to get to cast a wider net and get a greater selection of potential candidates for the Evans Scholarship. You're looking kind of lazy. You're kind of... I'm sorry it's just you want to be upright. You want to have that other hand behind your back. You're kind of standing in attention, giving that golfer your full attention that's good. You know it teaches you how to go through tough days and tough people, and early mornings, and hot summer days, and it takes grit. You should be able to do this in six strokes and you've probably had twenty. To receive the Evans Scholarship, some of the main points that you need to have are like mainly academics, leadership, you need to do community service all throughout. You have to have a good attitude to be able to represent the Evans Scholarship and all that in the right way. You've got to learn to serve before you can lead. And caddying is the best way to serve. I mean you have to just stick with it whether the guy's shooting 150 or 69. You got to serve, and you don't get to say anything. And you got to show up on time. I think that's a great thing to teach your kids. You get to meet people you really love and then you get to meet people you don't like so much because that's real life, right? You know, you've got to be able to be sort of resilient. You know, it's sort of like what does it mean to be to do well at life. You can feel comfortable, you know, really serving someone and you can be quiet and let someone have all their moment. You don't have to take over... take the stage. - What's the biggest tip you've got all year? - Um, sixty dollars. Sixty bucks? That's the biggest tip? Yes, Sir. - How much? - Sixty dollars. - That was pretty big. - For your tip? Duffy usually doesn't even get to sixty. That'll be safe today. So, the BMW Championship is the second-oldest championship in the United States. One hundred percent of the proceeds go to the Evans Scholars Foundation. At the BMW Championship every time a player steps up to a par 3, there's a chance that some lucky student could receive an Evans scholarship if only the guy would hit it in the hole. Just hit it in the hole! Hunter Mahan said this is a very easy hole occasions where the ball wants to end up. Hunter Mahan actually hit a hole-in-one in the BMW Championship. When I got the scholarship, I couldn't believe it. It was kind of surreal. If I didn't get the Evans Scholarship, I wouldn't be as far as I am in terms of my character. For Mahan coming up to retrieve that souvenir. The day that I got the Evans Scholarship my mom texted me when I was at school and was like, "We got an envelope in the mail and it's from the Evans." I was like, "Is it a small envelope or is it a big envelope?" And she was like, "No, it's a really big envelope." I just like, put it down and like started like bawling. I don't know, it was just like very surreal that whole day. The last question in the Evans Scholarship interview is how would this scholarship impact you and your family and change your life? My mom has had breast cancer since I was born. So, she's had it for eighteen years. And there's no way I was going to college with all of her medical bills. So, this is going to completely give me the opportunity to go out there, be an engineer and make a difference. And change people's lives like my mom's. And, unfortunately, my mom passed away in February, but she loved that I was a caddie and she was my biggest supporter. So, I think about that every day and if I wasn't an Evans Scholar, I don't think I'd really have a lot. So, it's changed my life and it's continuing to do so every single day. - There's two color hats. There's a rookie and advanced. - Right. So, we have a green and blue. But I think you're ready. - I think I am, too. - I think we're going to retire that hat. - Done a nice job today. - Thank you. It didn't dawn on me until a few years in that my ten years as a math teacher for fifth and sixth-graders really in a strange way, prepared me for being a caddie. In 2007 Chambers Bay Golf Course opened one mile from where Michael Greller was a fifth-grade math teacher. During summer breaks Michael began to caddy to supplement his already enormous teacher's salary. I'm on the couch watching the Masters in 2012 and my wife said, "You know, in five or ten years if you're still sitting on the couch watching how's that going to make you feel? And you had an opportunity to potentially pursue that." It really made me think about, you know, how passionate am I about this? In 2010 the US Am came here and I got to work for Justin Thomas and just hit it off with him. He had a great week and my little caddie dream was off and running. Justin Thomas introduced Michael to an eighteen-year-old friend from Texas who was climbing the junior ranks and looking for a caddie. And we had an initial connection to each other and just natural chemistry. I'll tell you what if we're going to talk about player and caddie combinations I don't think I've ever seen a stronger one than Jordan and Michael. Jordan Spieth was pretty vocal in the golf course and will talk to his golf ball. Sit down, ball. Sit down! Michael Greller is instrumental in helping him use that energy in a positive way. Jordan Spieth, at nineteen years old, qualified for the 2014 Masters just three years after joining forces with Michael Greller. My biggest role with Jordan is to get him to believe in himself and as an educator, I always thought that my biggest role is getting kids to believe in themselves and it's the same thing, you know, caddying on the PGA Tour. ♪♪♪ Arriving at the 2014 Masters as unknowns, completely unfamiliar with the course, Michael Greller approached Augusta looper legend Carl Jackson for some help. I introduced myself, asked if he had a few moments of his time to spend with me. And next thing I know, I'm at the caddie area with Carl Jackson. They would take out Carl's weathered, old yardage book where every green has a red dot on it. That's the direction of Rae's Creek on that particular green. Carl learned that all putts brake toward Rae's Creek from Pappy Stokes. And, largely, kept that a secret between he and Crenshaw. They figured that gave them an advantage. I think Carl was winding down his Masters career and maybe wanted to pass along some of his knowledge to somebody else. At just twenty years of age, Jordan Spieth would finish the 2014 Masters, second behind Bubba Watson. And then in 2015, Michael Greller had gone from being a math teacher and local club caddie to one of the most well-respected, well-liked, and highest paid for old caddies in the world. Michael and Team Spieth has helped Jordan reach many goals, but maybe none as memorable as the 2017 Open Championship. In the final round of play, Spieth was tied for the lead going into the 13th hole. Oh, dear. This is so far right. Yeah, yeah. This is catastrophic. Jordan launched his drive into the knotty grass of a knoll. Not usually thought of as being part of the golf course. He's taking an unplayable, Jimmy. He's taking an unplayable... He can't hit it off that slope, Sammy. It's so steep you can hardly stand on it. Let alone hit a ball. There is an eye in Michael and in Spieth but there is no I in team. And Jordan, going against his own instinct, agreeing with Mike's call on the yardage and the club. Hmm, the plot thickens. Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant from Jordan Spieth. Jordan Spieth, the Open Champion that took him almost half an hour to play the 13th. Spieth became only the second male golfer to win three Majors before his 24th birthday. I'd like to thank my caddie, Michael, for keeping me in it today, after not quite an ideal start. And this is as much mine as it is his right now at this very moment. And I really appreciate that, Mikey. You deserve all the credit in the world for this... this championship. We live in a world where it's all about a what's someone doing for me? What's everybody doing for me? And it's humbling to be in a profession that is the complete opposite of that where it's always what can I do for you? My name is Allen Hall. I'm from White River Junction, Vermont. And I'm here with my son Hunter, who has disabilities of autism. And he is playing for the United States of America in the world games. We're going to aim for right between the two sand traps. That's beautiful, Hunter. Nice job. We started him playing golf fifteen years ago. He got so excited the first time just watching the flight of the ball. He just holds that club all the way back and doesn't move just... He's just in awe of the flight of the ball. Yay! Both my wife and I are pretty good about Hunter's range. We both know each club selection and what his range is. So, that's... that's an important job as a caddie. And he trusts us. He believes in that range. Give it a good stroke 'cause you're through some thick grass and you're uphill. That's a good shot. Oh! Whoo! He doesn't get upset that you know, he might shoot 103 and somebody shoots a 79. He's happy with the range of golf he can play. And he just enjoys every time he can get out there and play. I've had a lot of jobs coming up. You know sheet metal mechanic, bus driver, lot of good jobs, but for some reason I wanted to be on a golf course. And it's more than just the money with me. It's the satisfaction of seeing somebody, do something that's very, very hard. That's the fun part about it. That's the thing of a caddie. That's a true caddie. I wouldn't trade it for nothing in the world. My last thirty years have been great. I don't have a lot, but it's been great. I wanted to work for somebody that I would love to be around on and off the course. You know it had nothing to do with traveling the world, making money. It was I want to be around somebody I enjoy. You know he's become one of my best friends. Standing behind the most successful players in the world are the caddies that inspire them. Tom Watson and Alfie Fyles, later with Bruce Edwards, Arnold Palmer and Nathaniel "Iron Man" Avery, Jack Nicklaus and Willie Peterson, Jerry Beard and Fuzzy Zoeller, Nick Faldo and family, Tiger Woods and Steve Williams. And just as Michael Greller and Jordan Spieth are in the early days of their journey, Ben Crenshaw and Carl Jackson's has come to an end. They teamed up for their first Masters Tournament in 1976 and met there every April for thirty-nine years. And won two Masters together, nearly won three others and on the same day in 2015, they retired together. I came off the 36th-hole and I could see that big figure on the back of the greens, and it gave me a... it just... It... it warmed my heart. It's showing front and center, how much of a team game golf is now. And that the guys who think the caddie is just there to show up, stand up, and shut up, the guys who think that about caddies, they don't win. And they stopped winning a long time ago. Golf is the only sport in the world where an assistant, an ally, a coach, a therapist, maybe even a family member, definitely a friend, is allowed on the field of play with the athlete. No matter the technical advice a caddie may offer, it's the relationship that determines their success. ♪♪♪ ♪ Oh fellow of Scotland ♪ ♪ When will we see Your likes again ♪ ♪ Your likes again ♪ Take one. Are you familiar with Nick Faldo's former caddie Fanny Sunesson? I never touched her. I was... - Uh... - Do you have a nickname? I don't think I can talk about my nickname. So, he's uh, I'm not ready to talk about it on camera. President Clinton visited Ballybunion a few years back. They put the statue up right after his visit. It cost thirty-three thousand pounds. It's a monument. There are people that look at it, people take photographs there, but we could have done with filling potholes instead of putting that statue there. My rule as a caddie is keep up, shut up. That's number one. Show up and shut up. - Show up and shut up. - Keep up and shut up. Show up, keep up, shut up. Show up, shut up and keep up. Somebody who shows up, shuts up, and is on time all the time. No. I'm just kidding. But most of all, shut up. Well, I think we all caddied for Chick Evans at one point or another. He had a driver that was about as long as this boom right here. But he was like... he was like... he was like caddying for the Dalai Lama. He was sort of a saint and he really was a sweet man. So, I jump ship in Hong Kong. And I make my way over to Tibet and I get down as a looper at a course over there in the Himalayas. A looper? A looper, you know, a caddie. A looper. John. Thank you, thank you.
