(dramatic music) - I believe there is justice in America. That good will triumph over evil. And that an individual's rights are the pillar in which a society stands. (jazz music) (whistle blowing) I believe we will fight for a society that protects the weak and humble and provides them with opportunity. But I do not, ladies and gentlemen, believe in being naive. (gunfire) For we are at war. A war that remains unfinished. A war that you can help win today. For you have the weapon now. A weapon more powerful than anything used by professional killers like Carlos Luca. Yeah. That weapon, ladies and gentlemen, is the law. And the bullet it fires is justice. Justice. Justice. - The courthouse downtown is jammed full as the city awaits the verdict. Probably the biggest story today would be the presence of Joseph Scassi, who showed up at the trial of hitman Carlos Luca. - The trial that rocked the underworld has reached a pinnacle as experts predict the conviction of hitman Carlos Luca, the man who would be most affected, America's number one king of slime, mobster boss Joseph Scassi, made an appearance today, sending shockwaves through the packed courtroom. Kathleen Davis is downtown. - Joseph Scassi, reputed to be American's number one mobster, appeared in court today, but only as a spectator at the trial of hitman Carlos Luca. Scassi, experts agree, is probably a most interested spectator, as a conviction of Luca could lead authorities directly to Joseph Scassi and his vast underworld operation. (tense music) - The court will adjourn until the jury has completed its deliberations. (elevator bell dinging) - Excuse me. So who the hell do you think you are? Summating your case without the testimony of a key government witness. - I changed my mind about his testimony. - Who gave you the right to change your mind? I'm gonna look like a fool to the attorney general. - Relax. We'll win this case, don't worry about it. - And if we don't? - Oh right, I forgot. We paid good taxpayers' money for that witness. - How dare you talk to me like that. - Can't you see that all we do is give one murderer freedom to put another one in jail? - I said that's enough. You wanna do things your way, find yourself another job. (elevator bell ringing) - Next time, just feel free to jump in, huh? - Hey, wunderkind, you're the one with the 12 straight convictions, not me. Besides, screw Peters, I'd apologize to Attila the Hun if it got me the chance to prosecute Joe Scassi. - Yeah, well be my guest. We don't even have a case against him. - Paulie, everybody's got a smoking gun somewhere. We'll find his. - And if not, we could always buy one, right? - How's Trace, Mr. District Attorney? - You're next, Scassi. I'm gonna make sure I find you a nice cell right next to your friend. - Mr. Peters, unless you have an indictment in your back pocket, I suggest you watch what you're saying. Harassment is a very serious offense. - So is murder. - Has the jury reached a verdict? - We have, Your Honor. We, the jury, find the defendant not guilty. (whispering) - Court is adjourned. (gavel banging) - Hey, Joe, do you think District Attorney Peters is serious about retrying on the 1984 murder charge? - Mr. Scassi, isn't it true that Carlos Luca works for you as an enforcer in your crime family? - Word on the street says you ordered the hits on Tony Bregaro and Joey Scallari. - You think District Attorney Peters is serious? - Get back. Get back, hey, stay back, come on. - Isn't it true that Carlos Luca works for you as an enforcer in your crime family? - Move along, people. Move along. Now you get back, hey, get back. Stay back, come on. - Get him. - But, Joseph. - Take off. - Move back. (ominous music) - That's great. (cars honking) (dark dramatic music) (car engine revving) - Mr. Dell, I'm with Stern, Jessup, and Gold. Mr. Stern asked if you would be kind enough to give him a call, at your earliest convenience. You have a nice day. - Yeah. - Say hello to my little friend, man. - Cute, Frankie, real cute. - You know, you got no sense of humor, man. (ominous music) That is very bad for you. - Yeah, right. How much? - The usual. (popcorn crunching) - You're killing me, how am I supposed to make any dough? (bell ringing) - Hey, paesan. I'll get that to you later, mister, when it comes in. - All right. - All right, yeah. - Hey, mister, you forgot your tape. - Thanks, man. - He seemed a little nervous, don't you think? - Got something to say, maybe you should say it. - You've been in the joint twice before, Frankie, you screw up a third time, it's over, I'm telling you. - Paulie, Paulie, Paulie, what's the matter, what's the matter? Huh, you don't trust your older brother? You didn't catch enough bad guys today huh? Come on, counselor, take it easy. I'm rolling in dough. Get Maria something nice, will you? - Maybe I'm the one in the wrong line of work, huh? - Hey, don't you ever say that, ever. - Yeah okay, come on, let's go, we're late for dinner. Come on. - All right, I'll lock up, go ahead. Ball-breaker. - Nice hair. - We did good today huh, Frankie? - We did real good, pal. Erase that tape, huh? - Why? - 'Cause my brother's on it. He'd never set us up. Here. Don't spend it on a girl. (phone ringing) - Frankie? - Snooks, where are you? - I'm up Shit's Creek, that's where I am, Frank. Listen, we gotta talk. I can't hold on much longer. - Snooks, Snooks, relax, will you? We're no rats. - Neither was Tony or Joey and look where they wound up. - Those sons of bitches dug their own graves, all right? Now stop being so goddamn paranoid. - That's easy for you to say, I ain't got a brother with the DA's office. - Don't you ever, don't you ever mention his name again, you hear me, Snooks? - Yeah, I hear you. What, do you think I'm fucking deaf? - Anybody following you? - No, I made sure. I made sure, Frank. - You sure? - Yeah yeah yeah, I made sure. Frankie, please don't let them make me dead, huh? - Oh, Snooks, come on, don't start that. Ain't nobody dying. You're freaking me out with that. Now stay calm, all right? I got a plan, I got a way to get us out of this, but you got to stay cool, man. You can't do nothing stupid. All right, talk to you later. - Okay. (ominous music) - What took you guys so long? What, are you losers or something? Were you dealing something up there or what? - I had to count all my drugs and money. - Your what? - I'm gonna race you to your car, man. (laughing) Oh my god. - Oh man, I wonder how much they're asking for. - Oh, Paulie, I would give my left nut for this. - You almost did. Remember? - Our ride with you, me, and Snooks. - Oh, Snooks, you ever hear from him? - Never, man. - Hey, can you still hit two sewers? - With my eyes closed. (upbeat music) - With my eyes closed. - Come on. Come on, batter up. - Come on. - Come on, let's see what they taught you in law school, baby. (grunting) Oh. Great call. Come on, Dellacroce. - This is too fast for you. - Come on, college boy, let's see it. (grunting) Oh, strike, I can't believe it. Down to the wire, baby. (chuckling) Nice and easy, baby, put it in here. - All right, all right, this is the one, it's the one, it's the one. (grunting) - Oh. (whooping) I told you. (humming) - Oh, that smells good. - Oh, Paulie, I didn't see you. - What's the matter? - Oh nothing, it's just dinner's almost ready. You must be hungry. - You and Papa had a fight? - Oh. One week he's back from the hospital from a heart attack and he's down there fixing shoes. - I'll talk to him, okay? Don't worry. - No no no no, my son, the District Attorney of New York, can't be bothered with those things. - I'm an assistant DA, Mom, there's a big difference. - I know what you are. The only member of this family who's ever gonna amount to anything. The only one who hasn't broke my heart. - She didn't mean that, man, it's just... (chuckling) - I know. She never does. - Why do you do that, Mom? - What? - Pick on him. - What do I do? - You know what you do, forget about it. Frankie. - I'm gonna get Pop. (doorbell ringing) Hey. Is this the most beautiful girl in the world? - Hey. How are you doing? - Some guys have all the luck, huh? - Guess what? - What's that? - I got the tickets. - You did? You should've called, I've been worried. - Well, I didn't want to miss my bus. - You didn't? Maria, how many times have I told you? Take a taxi at night. - Take a taxi at night. - Yes. - Well, great, but I don't wanna spend all my money on taxis, so. - So use my money, just take a taxi next time. - What's wrong, what's wrong? What, did you lose the case? You lost the case, didn't you? Mm-hmm. Oh. - Eh, don't worry, kid, you get that scumbag Scassi, you get 'em all. (sighing) - I'm gonna go get the coffee. - Cosa Nostra. They should all be sent back to Italy. - Pop, I'm gonna go check the score, huh? - Oh, you mean you're gonna go find out how much money you threw away. - What's the matter with sports? - Yeah, that's right. - Sports? That boy would bet on a cockroach race with his hoodlum friends and his bookies. - Are you finished with this, Pop? - Forecast, cloudy, windy, and cold. - So, Maria, when's the happy day? I'm an old woman who wants her grandchildren before she dies. - We can't even afford our own house, least as much a family. - I am going to take the coffee into the living room. - I'm here in front of the federal courthouse building with today's not guilty verdict of mobster Carlos Luca has surely dealt a blow-- - Hey, Paulie, they're talking about the trial. - Here with me is District Attorney Carl Peters. How badly do you think today's verdict will affect your case against Scassi? Under federal RICO statutes, prosecutors will attempt to retry reputed mafia chieftain Joseph Scassi. - Oh, we're really not all that concerned. What today proves is that the closer we get to Joe Scassi-- - Paulie, I don't understand. What's going on? - The more difficult it becomes to obtain a conviction. Therefore I have decided that when Mr. Scassi is formally indicted, I will personally prosecute the case myself. Thank you. (scoffing) - That's his case. - There you have it. This is Allison Bibicoff live from the federal courthouse. (somber music) (sighing) - Man. - Paul. - Hey. I'm sorry. - Come here. - Everything happens for a reason. (whistling) - Taxi. Taxi, yo. - Pretty big, huh? - Yeah, a guy could get lost. - Not if he knows what he's looking for. - Charles Stern. - Top floor. (bird cooing) - Bothered me the first time too. - I don't know, it seems to me that they've come this far, they've earned the right to rest awhile, you know? - Harvard doesn't always pay does it, counselor? - I got no complaints. - No? (laughing) Of course not. I was an assistant DA quite some time ago. Hungry, pure, eager to save the world. Even convinced myself I was right on the verge of doing it. Fortunately, one of the good side effects of growing older is that you become a little wiser. - Well, DA's office. Great place to learn the ropes. - As long as you get out before they hang you. - You trying to save my neck, Mr. Stern? - I'm offering you a job. - I got a job. - At $200,000 a year? Armstrong, could you come in here, please? Ah. Paul, this is Joan Armstrong, one of our junior partners. Joan, this is Paul Dell. Paul works at the DA's office. - Yes, I've seen him in action. You're very good. - Why don't you take a look around and see for yourself that we're not a bunch of demons in black robes plotting the end of the world. Hope to hear from you soon. - Come on, I'll show you around. We'll take awhile. - Yeah. A guy could get lost. - It's a little different from downtown, isn't it? This is our dining room. - Yeah? - Where we have one of the city's best chefs. - Is this a law firm or a country club? - Is there a difference? (sighing) - So what law school did you go to? - Harvard, don't hold it against me. - Harvard, really? It's a pretty tough place to get into. - Hey, I'm a pretty tough girl. And this is our exercise room and spa. Company-owned equipment. - Excuse me. - Hi, Dave. - Hi, Joan. - I should start working out. - We all should. - I hear he got 250. - He's gotta be worth it. I mean, Stern's the cheapest bastard alive. - He settled a municipal bond case at Oppenheimer his first week. - Where the hell did he go, Harvard? - You ready for this? City college. - Come on, get the hell outta here. - I'm telling you. And Joan Armstrong is in heat for this guy. - You're crazy. Joan Armstrong is a rich bitch. I'm telling you, the guy's engaged anyway. - So, when has that ever mattered? Oh man. - Oh, is he looking? - Yeah, wave. - Who are those guys? - They're junior partners at the firm. - Oh. - Pricks. (chuckling) So how are things downtown? - Not bad, they're heating up a little. - Yeah? We got any witnesses? - We, Paulie? - Sorry. You know, muscle memory. - I'll bet it was. Look, buddy, do yourself a favor, forget about it. It's not your problem anymore. - Yeah. ♪ I've had enough this time ♪ What are you doing? - I just wanted to be on the video. Where you been? - Out being stupid. (beeping) - Hey, Frankie, it's Paul. Showing Maria the new apartment tonight, you should come on by. It's, where is it? It's at 425 East 72nd. - Going to my brother's huh? - Frankie, it's Snooks. Shit, where are you? I'm being followed. Jesus, I gotta see you. Meet me tonight at nine at the boat. Nine o'clock. Don't be late, man. - Shit. All right, look, you gotta lock up, all right? I gotta go. We'll go to my brother's another time. Lock up good, Whoop. - Frankie and Whoopie might drop by. - Oh, it's really great the way your brother takes care of Whoopie. - Yeah, I guess. He can hardly take care of himself. What do you think? - Um, I think it's a bachelor pad. - Oh no no, it's just a settler for six months. Some view, huh? - Is that Queens? - Brooklyn, Queens. The world's at your fingertips, sweetie. - Uh-huh. - Look at this. Look at this. - Wow. But it's July. - You want an air conditioner? - No, no, no no no no. - What about my brother? - You know Frankie, he's always late. (groaning) - Oh yeah. (doorbell ringing) Oh yeah. (grunting) Ah, Frankie. No, don't stop, let it ring, let it ring. No, stay here. - Stay put, stud. I'll be right back. - Come on. - Don't move. You wanna tie the knot, Mr. Dell? - Just answer the door. - Surprise. - Can I help you? - You must be Maria. - Yeah. - I'm Joan. I've obviously caught you guys at a bad time. - Yeah, you're batting a thousand. - Hey. - Thank you. Ms. Armstrong. - It's Joan. - Yeah, yeah, Joan works at the firm. - Joan works late. - Well, a girl has to nowadays. I was just in the neighborhood, so I thought I'd stop by. You know, I live really close and we're practically neighbors. - Did you want to get some glasses? - Sure, sure, sure, yeah, give me those things, huh. - Nice. Very nice. Fabulous view. - Yeah, that's the general consensus. - Well, you must be very proud of Paul now. - Oh, I've always been proud of Paul, yeah. - This is wonderful. - Yeah, give me two. (moaning) Wow. Why can't I find a girl like this? Oh man, that's something. I hate when they do that. They don't clean up. (ominous music) - Goodnight. - Yeah. - It was nice of you to come over. - Well, thank you, this was good. - Yeah. Thank you for the champagne. - You're welcome. Oh, before I forget. - Okay. - Stern wanted me to ask you a favor, if you would babysit a client with me tomorrow. - Oh sure, no problem. - Great. - Won't you be needing this? - Oh. - Here, let me get that for you. - Silly me, I forgot my briefs. It was nice meeting you. - Likewise. - I'll find my way out. - Okay, see you tomorrow. She's very nice. - Adorable. (giggling) (applause) - Thank you. Thank you all for coming. - Why didn't you tell me it was Scassi? - Simple, you wouldn't have come. - Yeah. - Thank you. Welda, how are you? - Hardly seems like the type who needs babysitting. - You'd be surprised. - Thanks. In New York and the rest of the country, they call Joseph Scassi a lot of things. In New Jersey, we call him a friend. We are here today to honor this great man and his family. They have given us a new wing for cancer research that will save countless lives. That is not the act of a villain. That is the act of a true American hero. Please join with me in a round of appreciation for one who has not forgotten his roots, Joseph Scassi. (applause) - Thank you very much. Thank you. Thanks. - I'm so proud of you, Joe. - Oh thanks, sweetie. - I'm proud of you too, Dad. - Thanks, kid. I'll see you later, okay? Thanks. - Take care, take care. - Appreciate it. Help the hospital. - I thought the mayor was gonna be here. - It's a little hard right now with the indictment. I'm sorry, Mr. Scassi. - Yeah, I understand. (speaking in foreign language) You build us a hospital. You are infecting your neighborhood with the drug that kill our children. You go to hell, you bastard. (speaking in foreign language) What this gentleman just said to me is very upsetting. But what he said is true. I was once guilty of this. But I want you all to know that I've been to hell, to prison, for my crimes. And what I do here today, and from now on, is part of my atonement. If you can't forgive me, I understand. I pray God will. - God bless you, Mr. Scassi. God will forgive you. - Too bad he's a crook, he makes a great politician. - Be careful, you might be contradicting yourself. - Thank you. Thank you all for coming. (applause) It looks like Baratta's closed. Check it out, Tino. (ominous music) - It's Mr. Baratta's kid, he got stabbed. - This city's becoming a fucking jungle. - Snooks is dead? - You knew him? - Yeah, we used to run in the same gang together. - You were in a gang? (chuckling) - Yeah. - That's funny. - Fortunately, I outgrew it. - What does that mean, you got taller? - No, just smarter. - That's good. So did I. - Paul, we should go. - Yeah. - No, no no no, let's go for something to eat. I know another place right down the street. - Thank you, Mr. Scassi, but I've already got plans. - What about you? - I'm having dinner with my family. - Take my car. Tino, you don't mind taking Mr. Dell for a ride, do you? - Be my pleasure. - No no no no, thanks anyway. - Are you sure? - I am positive. - I'll get back to you on the mayor. - Now let's get outta here. - Hey, Paul, thanks again. - See you tomorrow. (dramatic music) Taxi. Yo, taxi. - Come on, answer, you mother... Answer, you son of a bitch. Come on, an... Buddha? Yeah, man, it's Frankie, how are you? Yeah, well I've been busy. Hey listen, Buddha man, I think we should have a meeting. No, no, fuck that shit, man. No more nickel dime, uh-uh. Mm-mm, I'm talking the big screen, man. - Is there a phone? - It's in the back. - Thank you. (phone beeping) Hey, Maria, how are you? Hey, I'm sorry, honey, it's I've been trying to hail a cab. It's... Yeah, I know, I know it's been three times this week, sweetie, I've been working. Relax... Where's Frank? Where's Frankie? - Espresso. Anisette. - Yeah, all right. Right, okay. Me too. - Hey, lawyer, trouble in the family? - No. - Well, my wife is all over me too, you know? When I work late. Have an espresso. And I'll tell you, the world's a crazy place. It's gone nuts. Look at this. Three cops blown away this month. I'll tell you, it's a real breakdown of social order. - Maybe you should make a donation to the Policemen's Benevolent Association then. - That's a good idea. Good idea. Tino, remind me to send a donation to the families of the slain officers, huh? - How much, Mr. Scassi? - Make it 10,000. - I didn't realize you had such respect for the law. - I don't respect the law. It's justice I respect. Come on. Let's take a walk. So how come you changed your name? Paul Dellacroce. - It's none of your business. - You ashamed of being Italian? Well, maybe you figured if you put enough of us in jail, that part of you might disappear. - Everybody I put in jail deserves to be there and you know it. - If everybody got what they deserved, the world would be over. - Freeze. - Freeze. - Halt. - Hold it right there. - Come on. - All right. - Get the fuck off me, man. Get off me. - Easy, easy. (glass shattering) (siren wailing) (tires screeching) - Get off me. - Don't get excited. All right, all right. - He's fine, he's fine. Back off, back off, easy, easy, easy. - What the hell are you doing here? - We're walking down the street. Is that a crime, Carl? - If you're walking with me, it is. - Not a good night to go for a stroll in the old neighborhood, huh? - What, indict him with the whole world watching? - You better get out of here, Paul, or they're gonna lock you up. - Get him out of here. - You got a hair in your nose. - Oh, very funny. - Get a hold of Stern. - You're a big man, Peters. Where's Mr. Jessup and Mr. Gold? They, call them at the country club. Hello? - Paul. They're not gonna wait any longer. - Well, it looks like you're on then. - I've never argued a criminal case in my life. - Yeah. Now's your chance. Hm? (gavel banging) - Mr. Scassi, will you and your attorney please rise? Mr. Scassi, under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, you're being formally charged with committing crimes as part of a pattern of racketeering with a specific organization. How do you plead to these charges? - My client pleads not guilty, Your Honor. - Very well. I'll now hear arguments for the amount of bail to be set for the defendant. Mr. Peters? - Your Honor, we request that the defendant be remanded to the county prison without bail due to his well-documented affiliation with violent criminals-- - Objection, Your Honor. - Within his own organization. - You have something to say, Ms. Armstrong? Mr. Dell, exactly what is your capacity here today? I do not allow cheerleaders in my courtroom. - I'm sorry, Your Honor. - Perhaps I can help you, Ms. Armstrong. Mr. Peters, is there a specific reason why bail should be denied to the defendant? - We feel that Mr. Scassi's freedom would pose a direct threat to the life of any witnesses the government might produce in this case. - Joan. - Very well. Since there's no argument from the defense, the defendant will be remanded to the county courthouse. - Objection, Your Honor, the prosecutor is accusing the defendant of committing a crime which hasn't even taken place? - Objection, Your Honor, this man is not the recognized counsel to the defendant. - Your Honor, the defendant's attorney Charles Stern is unreachable. As his associate, I beseech the court to allow me to stand in for this hearing. (gavel banging) You shoulda seen Carl's face, it was priceless. It was priceless, he was just standing there. I loved it. - Paul, look, Paul, please tell me you won't be representing Joseph Scassi. - No no no no no no, I was just standing in for Stern. That'll never happen. - Look. - What? - If you want a piece, counselor, you have to buy the entire cake. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. - Oh baby, would you want to? - Yeah, yeah. - Mr. Scassi was very pleased with the way you handled the situation in court. He'd like you to be his guest this afternoon at the Bayview Hunt Club. - You tell Mr. Scassi I appreciate it, but I got plans. - My instructions are not to take no for an answer. (chuckling) - I'll be back in awhile. Let me take care of this bozo for a little bit, okay? I'll be back before you know it. - Okay. Paul. I'll see you later. - We'll take good care of him. (ominous music) (tires screeching) (horse whinnying) (gunfire) - Those fucking rats, they're everywhere. - What the hell, are you crazy? - You let one of them go, there's 10 of them tomorrow. Like a disease. - You're under federal indictment, for crying out loud. You're riding around like some fucking cowboy? - You're a good lawyer. - What am I doing here? - I wanted to thank you for standing in for Charlie. - A phone call would've been sufficient. - Well, I also wanted to talk about my trial. This is the only place they haven't bugged. You know, those guys know every time I make it with my wife, but I give them a good show. - If you want to discuss your case, you talk to your lawyer. - I am. - You got the wrong guy. - I do? I heard you that day in court talking with the DA. You know, you were right. Nowadays, feds will make a deal quicker than a two-bit whore. - Sometimes they don't have a choice. - That makes it right? Yeah, that's justice for you. - How the hell am I supposed to get back? - What's the matter, are you afraid of getting dirty? - Yeah, you're damn straight I am. - Hey, don't get holy with me. Those witnesses you used to put on the stand to win cases, what were they? Murderers, pimps, child molesters, animals that do things I never even dreamed of. - That's why I left. - I know. And I'm gonna give you a chance to come back. - By defending you? - Yeah. - You're trying to tell me you're innocent? - Why do you find that so hard to believe? I don't need to bullshit you. Everyone knows the bad things I did with my life. I did my time. And not one of those country clubs. Seven years away from my wife and kid. You have any idea what that's like, Paul? - Why should I? - I never murdered Vinny Giacalla. I wasn't even there. That's why they'll never find an honest witness to say I was. - Oh, then you got nothing to worry about. - Yes, I do. My name ends in a vowel. And to guys like Peters, that makes me a target. - Well, Charles Stern will get you off. You don't need me. - Yes, I do. Charles is good, but in my gut, I know you're better. You know you're better. Paul, we're all innocent until proven guilty. Even me. - Yeah. I gotta get back. - Okay, let's go. If you don't mind, there's someone special I'd like you to meet. - Who would that be? - My don. It's a question of honor. I trusted you. And in my heart of hearts, I knew you wouldn't let me down. And this is what I get? You've disappointed this family. And now I have to make a decision. - I'm sorry, Dad. I'll try harder. - That's all I ever ask. Now go tell your mother we're ready for dinner. We'll speak again later. - Nice kid. - He takes after his mother. - Is he aware of what's going on? - My son only knows that his father is a good businessman. - What happens if he finds out? - Well, I pray to God that day never comes. Paul, if I'm lying about my innocence, may God take him and everything I care about away from me. - I don't know, all anyone ever hears about Joseph are the bad things. Maybe they should see what he's really like, the charities he gives to, the people he helps, it's incredible. - I understand that, I mean, it must be tough for you. The trial and all the publicity. - Well, I can handle it. I mean, I've handled it before, but you know, I worry about Donny. - He idolizes his father? - Yeah, he does. Come here, sweetie. Goodnight. Oops, get that off of there. - Is my father really gonna go to jail? - Donny, come on, sweetheart, it's bedtime. (upbeat music) - It's like it was made for you, Mr. Dellacroce. - This one, thanks. - Dellacroce? - Yeah. Mr. Dell never did sound right. I'm gonna wear this outfit. - Don't even look like you, pal. - And I'm gonna take it in gray as well. Huh? Huh? - What's the occasion, sport? - I took on a new client, man. - Oh yeah, who? - Let's get something for Maria. All right. - Would you like anything else? - No. I think that covers everyone. - Oh come on, man, I'm sure there's something in this store you haven't bought. - No, wait a second. Maria, Mike Adams-- - How about Mom and Pop? - I paid off their mortgage. After all these years, they finally own their own house, Frankie. - What a guy, huh? It's too bad he's taken. Let's go. Look at this, someone bought it. - You're kidding. - No, man, you think that's gonna sit around here? - Hey, Frankie. For the good old days, huh? Huh? (upbeat rock music) - Paulie, Paulie. Paulie, I love you! - Now, the government's got witnesses that'll tell you that Joseph Scassi is an extortionist. They got others that'll tell you that he's committed blackmail, arson, grand theft, robbery. They even have a witness that'll tell you that Joseph Scassi is not very kind to animals. Listen, every one of these witnesses is looking at jail time for their own acts. And their freedom depends on what they say here today in court. For all of them, Joseph Scassi is the key that will unlock the cell. - Excellent. It's impressive, theatrical. I think it's brilliant. - Oh my god. - What? - Oh my god, Maria. The theater, I gotta meet her at the theater. Oh shit. (somber music) Hey. Sorry, baby. - That's okay, we'll just wait another year and then we can see the two acts you missed. - No, all right, relax, I'll get some more tickets next week. - Okay. - One second, one second, one second. - What, you're gonna get more tickets? What, is Joe Scassi gonna get 'em for you? - Come down here, come down here for a second. What was that supposed to mean? - Figure it out. - Listen, honey, I don't criticize your line of work, don't criticize mine. - Well, I don't defend murderers, Paul. - Why are you doing this? - Paul, let's move out of New York. You could get a new job representing farmers with broken tractors or something and-- - I've busted my chops for seven years working for nothing for that guy. Now's my chance. - Since when is doing what's right worth nothing to you? - What's right? Don't be so naive, sweetie. I mean, you would be surprised what the justice department will do just to make the five o'clock news. - What about what Joe Scassi has done? I mean, are you gonna forget that? (shushing) - Hey, you do it one more time, pal, I'll bust your face, you hear me? - Okay. - Maria. Maria. Hey, Maria. - Taxi! - Maria. - Taxi. - Don't do this. - First you defend him, then you dress like him, now you even act like him. What, has he become an obsession for you, Paul? (scoffing) Taxi. - What do you want me to do? - Make a choice. You can't be in bed with both of us. Brooklyn. - Maria. (operatic singing) (somber music) Hey. - Hey. How was the show? - Lousy ending. Don't you ever quit? - I can go all night. (phone ringing) - Is there anything to drink around here? - Yeah. Stern's office. - Paul, it's Maria. If you're there, please call me. - Come on. How you want it? - What? - The scotch. - Straight up. A little understanding. - Well, there's only a little bit of scotch but-- - That's good. - There's a lot of understanding. I'm sorry. Oh. (sensual rock music) (moaning) Yes. (moaning) - Last count of government witnesses. - 86. - What about the charts of the prior convictions? - They're all finished. - Excellent. - What about local muscle? - Paul and I visited the mayor yesterday. He's onboard. - I'd like to say that everybody's work in this room has been excellent and I'm very proud to call myself your colleague. Now, I hope you'll all join me in what has become a pre-trial good luck ritual of mine. Like a famous general in the Army once said, grab 'em by the balls and their hearts and minds will follow. Let the war begin. Salud. (ominous music) (snorting) - Didn't I say I was your man, Buddha? - Yeah you did, Frankie. To business. - Yeah right. - Where's the rest? - Where's my money? - Frankie, come on, you don't trust me? - In God I trust, all right? Everybody else pays cash, Buddha. - Where's your sense of humor, Frankie? - A cop, just what we need. - Oh shit. - Merry Christmas. - Yeah, that's great. Surprise, Frankie. - Hold it. - Wait. (gunshot) - Frankie. Frankie. (tense music) (gunfire) (tires screeching) (tires squealing) (siren wailing) - You're a long way from home, aren't you? - What the hell are you doing here? - Just slumming. Any objections, huh? - This doesn't concern you. - Anytime the mob makes a hit, it concerns me. - The mob? What the hell are you talking about? - Why don't you ask Joseph Scassi? Or don't you know? - Know what? - Frankie used to work for him. Small world, huh? (banging) (dog barking) - What's the matter? - My brother's dead! - Shut up, shut up. - My brother's dead. - Act like a fucking man. What do you mean he's dead? - He's dead. (sobbing) - Okay. That was 15 years ago. He was just a kid, used to hang around the club, do some strong arm stuff. Then he got into drugs and that was the end of it. - Why didn't you tell me? - What good would that have done? It was another lifetime. Can't you see why Peters sent you here? He's trying to get you to turn on me. On my family's life, I swear to God, I did not kill Frankie. - Who did? - Well, the kid was into drugs. I mean, he could've had a ton of enemies. I don't want to go to jail. I need you to be 100% in my corner. Now, if you think I killed Frankie, you quit now. And I swear I'll never bother you again. (gavel banging) - The defense may now present its opening argument. - Nigger. Chink. Camel jockey. Kike. Mick. Me, if you're wondering, I'm a wop. So is my client. The prosecution has heralded this as the mafia trial of the century. And the man on trial is the modern-day godfather. I think what we have here is much simpler, much more basic than that. Do you know what's really on trial here? A man's heritage. Nothing more, nothing less. Hasn't the world seen enough of that? Of course it has. Of course it has. Thank you. (murmuring) - Mr. Peters, your witness. - Your Honor, the prosecution calls Auggie Calvini. - Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? - Yeah, so what about it? - You see what I mean? Fucking rats are everywhere. - How do you know Joseph Scassi? - He used to frequent a gambling joint I used to run. - And you became friends? - Kinda. I used to hang out at the Bayview Social Club. I had quite a few friends there. - Social club, hm. You mean they played darts and bingo there? - Not exactly. - Is it true that you heard conversations linking Mr. Scassi with hijacking, loan sharking, and extortion? - Nothing went down at the Bayview unless Joseph Scassi okayed it. - Didn't you break the legs of one Tony Aello because he owed Joseph Scassi some money from a bet he made on a professional football game? - Yes. - Isn't it true that in exchange for your testimony here today, you were offered immunity from a murder charge for which you are still serving time? - Yes. - Have you ever seen Mr. Scassi engage in any criminal activity? - No. - Speak up, please. - No. - Excuse me. (whispering) - Did you ever see Joseph Scassi hurt anybody? - I never seen Joe Scassi hurt anybody. - And hasn't Joseph Scassi financially supported your family for 10 years while you've been in jail? - Yes. - Who paid for your rehabilitation from heroin? - Joe did. - And who did you once describe in earlier testimony as the best friend a guy could have? - Joe Scassi. - No further questions, Your Honor. - That was good. - Mr. Peters, the prosecution may present its final witness. - Thank you, Your Honor. (chattering) (ominous music) - That's a lot of badge. - Your Honor, I object to this attempt by the prosecution to create an environment of terror in this courtroom. This display of force at a trial is a direct attack on my client's character and innocence. - Mr. Peters, I believe Mr. Dellacroce has a point. Is there a legitimate reason for such a display? - I apologize, Your Honor, but this witness is in great danger due to the testimony he's about to give. He's an eyewitness to a murder charge for which Mr. Scassi is on trial. Considering the circumstances, we took the maximum effort to protect him. - No, you mean you took maximum effort to prejudice this jury into seeing my client as a dangerous man. The district attorney, Your Honor, not once in months of pre-trial deliberations ever indicated that such a witness existed. - Mr. Peters. - This witness has only recently been granted immunity. And until such an agreement was reached, we felt it necessary to keep his existence a matter of secrecy. - No, you mean that it took you this long to set up some cushy relocation deal for this, what is he, a repenting murderer, a drug dealer? (gavel banging) - Mr. Dellacroce, you're out of order. The witness will take the oath and state his name for the record. - Your Honor, I wish to move that the witness be made to remove his hood. It's obvious, he's in no physical danger here. - I have no objection, Your Honor. - The witness will now remove his hood. (ominous music) (gasping) (chattering) - Paulie. - Franco. - Papa. - Seize the witness. - Paulie. - Papa. Papa. (gavel banging) - Order. - Those were your men in the car. You knew he was alive? - Congratulations, counselor. - You son of a bitch. (chattering) - Stop those men from fighting. - I'm all right, I'm all right. All right. - Somebody call the paramedics for that man. Mr. Dellacroce, Mr. Peters, in my chambers. Now. - Your Honor, I could just say-- - Shut up and sit down. I ought to remove both of you from this trial right now. Mr. Peters, what was the nature of the deal you agreed upon with the witness? - Immunity from prosecution on the charges of accessory to murder and the dismissal of drug charges. - He's not on witness protection? - Don't think I don't know what's going on here. I will not allow this trial to become a pissing contest for the two of you. You have 24 hours to make a motion for a mistrial, which I will agree to. If you choose not to do so, I assure you, any such future requests will be denied. Do I make myself clear? - Yes, Your Honor. - The judge's offer is totally unacceptable. No mistrial. - Did you kill Giacalla? - Vinny Giacalla planted a bomb under my family's car. The car my wife goes shopping in and takes my kid to school in. I should've ripped his fucking eyes out before he died. - You're right. But you never should've lied to me, Joe. - You wouldn't have taken the case. - No, you're wrong. I win this trial, my problems, they're over. - Paul, you're a good lawyer. You're an exceptional lawyer, but I need more than that. It's Charlie's case now. - Can Charlie give you a guarantee? I can. If I can have your word on your son's life that nothing, I mean nothing, happens to Frankie... - How you gonna get to him? He's sharing a bed with the feds, your old friends. - Don't worry about it. I can get to him. (dramatic music) - I'm gonna hold you to your word. - And I'm holding you to yours. (beeping) Papa, listen to me. We have to help Frankie. Papa. - He can't hear you. What are you trying to do, kill him altogether? It's not enough for you to ruin your own life, you have to drag them down too? It's not enough? - I am trying to save Frankie's life. - Oh right, and get ahead for yourself at the same time. - You have to believe in me, Maria. - Believe in you? - Listen. - Believe in you? (laughing) - Listen, listen, listen. Listen, listen. Everything you said about Scassi is right. You were right about everything, okay? You were, you were. But Frankie's gonna die unless Mom speaks to him. - I don't understand. - Mama's gotta tell Frankie to dummy up. Where is she? - I took her home. She's exhausted. - You gotta go get her. The feds are coming over here with Frankie to see Papa. - Want all of them? - Yeah. - Okay. - Here. - All right. (sighing) - Okay, give him the pad, he likes to draw. - Are you okay? - Yeah, sorta. - Let me get you some water. - Thanks. - Paul. - Oh. - They wouldn't let Mama speak to Frankie. - Great. Great. (sighing) Thanks. (chattering) Unbelievable what's going on here to me. I'm fucking sinking into quicksand. - Hey. You okay? - I'm okay. - Good. Good. - State your full name for the record, please. - Franco Cici Dellacroce. - Do you know the defendant Joseph Scassi? - Sure. That's him sitting there in the expensive suit. - Oh, I see two men sitting over there in expensive suits. Could you be more specific, please? - Yeah, he's the one with the beady eyes. And after that, I started working at the Social Club. You know, doing errands, whatever Joseph wanted me to do. - Did one of these errands involve a trip to the Falcon Bar in Brooklyn on June 29th, 1984? - Yeah. - Who accompanied you on that trip? - There was me. Tony Rigero. Joey Scallieri. And Snooks Baratta. - Where are these men today? - I hope they made it to heaven. - They're all dead, aren't they? - Objection, Your Honor, this is immaterial to this case. - I will allow you to continue, Mr. Peters, but don't deviate. - Frankie, was there anybody else with you on June 29th? - Objection, Your Honor, the prosecutor is leading the witness's testimony. - Sustained. Mr. Peters, you will rephrase the question. - Was the defendant, Joseph Scassi, with you and the other men on June 29th, 1984? - Yeah. He was with us. - And what was the purpose of your trip? - Kill Vinny Giacalla. - Who was Vinny Giacalla? - He's a scumbag from New Jersey. - Elaborate, please. - He was the guy that was moving in on Scassi's numbers action. - No, objection, Your Honor, that's hearsay. - Overruled. We've seen sufficient proof that Mr. Scassi ran gambling operations during this time. The testimony will stand. - Mr. Dellacroce, on June 29th, 1984, did you see Joseph Scassi execute Vinny Giacalla at the Falcon Bar? - Objection, Your Honor, this is total manipulation of a two-time loser who will say anything to stay out of jail. - Mr. Dellacroce, sit down, please, you're out of order. - Your Honor-- - I said sit down. Repeat the question, Mr. Peters. - Did you see Joseph Scassi kill Vinny Giacalla on the night of June 29th, 1984? (tense music) - Answer the question. - No, I didn't. - I beg your pardon? - You can beg all you want, I didn't see Joseph Scassi kill nobody. He wasn't even at the Falcon Bar. - You just said he was with you. - He was with me at the movies. - Then who killed Giacalla? - Well, you're gonna have to ask the others. - They're dead. - Life's a bitch, ain't it? - I have a sworn affidavit from you. Made just yesterday. Stating that you saw Joseph Scassi kill Vinny Giacalla at the Falcon Bar. - Well, you said I'd go to jail if I didn't sign it. - Now, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but let me assure you, Mr. Dellacroce, that if you have committed an act of perjury in this courtroom, you will be punished to the full extent of the law. - Well it can't be no worse than what the feds already done to me. (gasping) (chattering) I'm sorry, Paulie. I wanna shoot those bastards. It's not right. You take the job, okay? - Oh man, I already even started. Entrapment, police brutality, you'll be out on the street in 48 hours tops, don't worry, man. - What, what are you trying to do, kill me? - What are you talking about, I made a de... You did this on your own? - What did you think? That I'm gonna let your career go down the drain over my sorry stinking ass? - I'm not gonna let that happen. I made a deal with Scassi. - Oh, Paulie, so did Snooks. - What, do you think I look stupid? Scassi wouldn't dare touch you until the trial is over. So don't worry about it. (sighing) Now, you got a passport? - Why, I need one to get into heaven? - No. Switzerland. Italians, they hate the snow, right? - Oh. That look like a mugshot or what? - You look great. - Look like a mook. - You are a mook. - If I'm a mook, you're a marmaluke, pal. - What's a mook? - Or a marmaluke, for that matter. - I think it's an animal or something. Huh? (sobbing) Hey hey hey, come on now, what's the matter, Whoop? - I'm gonna miss you, Frankie. - Hey, hey. I'm gonna be back before you know it. And if I'm not, don't be surprised if I send for you. - I gotta pick up the tickets, guys. - Yeah, hang on, I'm gonna come out with you. - Mook. Come here. You're gonna miss him, huh? Me too. - How are things with you and Maria, man? - I'm trying. - Let me tell you something, this girl loves you. Don't be stupid. - Yeah. (sighing) - Paulie, you gotta promise me you're gonna take care of Whoopie. - Whoopie? - It ain't like he's a pain in the ass or nothing, man, but the kid, the kid's got nobody. - You know, you're a real tough guy, Frankie. - Promise me. - Yeah, I promise, I promise. All right. Frankie. Eight o'clock, no luggage, all right? - What, you think I'm stupid or something? Good luck tomorrow. - What's up with your hair, man? - Good luck, okay? - What's up with your hair? It just seems a little off. - I heard a rumor, counselor. - Hey, what's that? - That you've been named the youngest senior partner in this firm's history. - Oh. Well, I'm gonna turn it down. - Why? - I got my reasons, Joan. - Does Scassi know? - Mr. Dellacroce, your ticket is ready. Shall I send a messenger? - Oh that's okay, I'll pick 'em up. - Going on vacation? - Yeah, I think I deserve it. - Going alone? - No. - Oh. Well, I better go. Good luck tomorrow. - Paul, you sure you don't wanna come over to eat? Angela's cooking up a storm. - Yeah, I'm just working on tomorrow's closing argument. - Paul, I really appreciate what you've done. I don't forget. - Yeah right. I'll see you tomorrow. - Tino. Get the car. - Wait a minute. Where are you going, I'm making dinner. - Ah, I gotta go out for a few hours. - Out? - Can I pick you up something? - No, I'm okay, I'm fine. - How about a video? - Yeah, pick up a video. - No, I don't mean a porno video, I mean a video. (giggling) Huh? - Yeah, get a video. - I'll get it, babe. - Get a good, funny video. - All right. (ominous music) - Come on, Frankie, where the hell are you? We're gonna be late for the airport. (sobbing) (dramatic tones) - Our son did not commit suicide. - Enough question, leave us alone. - Papa, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. - Stop him, Paulie. Paulie. - Stop, stop. Stop, stop. Stop, stop. (sobbing) - Oh my god. (chattering) - Make sure we're not disturbed. - You look beat, Paulie, why don't you freshen up? - Freshen up? (glass shattering) - See if he's wired. - Yeah, I'm clean. - Okay, all right, get out. Get out, no one comes in. - But Joe-- - I said get out. - Why? - I told you. You let one rat go, there's 10 of them tomorrow. Like a disease. - You could've killed Frankie a long time ago. - You don't whack the brother of a district attorney. But the brother of a two-bit whore in a fancy suit, now that's a different story. Now let's go. You don't wanna be late for your closing argument. - I'd rather die, man. - No, no you wouldn't, no. You like living too much. - How'd you find out? - A little birdie told me. Oh, I think Charlie wants to make you a partner. (sighing) (glass shattering) (screaming) - Paulie. Jesus, Paulie. What are you doing? (screaming) - Fuck. - Paulie, what have you done? (sobbing) - Joseph Scassi has made a joke of this trial as he has made a joke of the laws of this country. If he walks out of this court today a free man, I have failed. And the minions of corruption that have so eloquently defended him have won. We are in the middle of an epidemic. And corruption is the disease. It has the power to infect and destroy all of us. No matter who we are. (tapping) (murmuring) - Mr. Dellacroce. - This is for you. Ladies and gentlemen. I believe there is justice in America. That good will triumph over evil and that an individual's rights is the pillar on which a society stands. But I also believe that District Attorney Peters is right. We are in the middle of an epidemic. And corruption is the disease. But just where does this corruption lie? In government, business? In each of our own souls inside, in there, digging. Can any of you sitting here today tell yourself you don't feel it daily, tugging at your heart? Pulling at the threads of your conscience? Of course you do. So before you pass judgment on Joseph Scassi, you have to ask yourself that basic question. Is his corruption any different than mine? Is it? - Has the jury reached a verdict? - We have, Your Honor. - The defendant will rise. You may read the verdict. - We, the jury, find the defendant not guilty. (applause) - You can write your own ticket now, Paulie. (upbeat jazz music) - Whoa, wait, wait a second. What do you mean we can't use the tape as evidence? (laughing) Oh, all right, is that how it's gonna be? You know what? Screw Peters. Screw him. No, sorry's not good enough. You know what, Mike, thanks for everything. All right, thanks for everything. Okay. - Paul, where are you going? - I'm going to hell, Maria. (beeping) (upbeat jazz music) - How do you like your steak, Colin? - Well done, Joe. You know I hate blood. - Angela. Any more wine? - Yeah. - Don't kill it, okay? - Okay. - Hey, hello, Paul, you come to celebrate? - Hey, I wouldn't miss this for the world. - This is a hell of a party, eh? You want some wine? - Sure, sure. Yeah, they really love you. But then again, they don't know you for the lying, murdering bastard that you are. (tense music) - Hey, if you're gonna be a party poop, why don't you get the hell out of here? Hey. - What do you want? - Now, that better be a smoke. - You can call it that. - What's this? - That's your death sentence. - Oh yeah? Or yours? (chuckling) (dramatic music) (gunshot) (glass shattering) - Donny. It's not what you think. - The sins of the father. - Take him to the marsh with the rest of the fucking rats. (dramatic music) (horse galloping) (gunfire) (gunshot) (chattering) - He's not here, he went to the store. - Look, don't play games with me, Mrs. Scassi. I already know he was here. - Don't point your finger at me. I don't know where Paul is. - Please, Mrs. Scassi, where did they take him? - Look, I already told you. My husband went to the store to buy wine. - I heard them say they were gonna take Paul down to the Hunt Club. - Come on. (tense music) - I believe there is justice in America. That good will triumph over evil and that an individual's rights are the pillar on which a society stands. But I do not believe in being naive, for we are at war, a war that remains unfinished. - Ow. (gunshot) (coughing) - How does the rest of it go, Paul? - You now have that weapon. - Go on. - The weapon is the law. And the bullet it fires. (gunshot) (horse whinnying) (grunting) - Go on. Shoot. What are you waiting for? You ain't gonna kill me. You haven't got it in you. - Is this how you killed Frankie? Is this how you did it to my brother? - No, no. I had a smile on my face when I killed him just like I'm smiling now. (laughing) (gunshot) - Paul, no. Paulie, no no, don't do it, don't do it. We got him, we got him, we all heard the confession. - Yeah? And what loophole is he gonna fall through this time? - Please, Paul, he's not worth it. - This is for Frankie, Scassi. The bullet it fires is justice. (gunshot) (somber music) (panting) Read him his rights, Mike. - Joseph Scassi, you're under arrest for the murder of Frankie Dellacroche. Get him out of here. (grunting) - You motherfucker. You're a dead man. There's no place you can hide from me. I'm gonna get you like I got the rest of them fucking rats. You're a dead man. A dead man. - All those things he did. - Come on, come on. (somber piano music) - Underworld kingpin Joseph Scassi is back in the headlines today just days after his win of murder charges in the spectacular courtroom drama that had America mesmerized. As we speak, Scassi is being charged with the first degree murder of known drug dealer Frankie Dellacroche.
