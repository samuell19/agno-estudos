I haven't done anything lately. Come on, man. Lately? Listen, Karen and some of the other customers are complainin' that you're bein' creepy and rude again. They're creepy and rude.

That's low life at its finest, but you know you still need this job. Yeah. Yeah, I know. I know. I'm just tired of Karen snitching on me. Yeah, I'm sick of John Snyder too. He thinks he's a gift to anything female. Honestly, he scares me. He only acts like that 'cause he's buddy-buddy with the sheriff. Feel sorry for his wife. Hope she knows what a dick he is. Yeah and how many women he's had in this town, how could she not know? Yeah. All right, I guess I'ma go clean some balls. Shut up. What you doin', Harvey boy? Leave me alone, John.

I cleaned them myself. Okay, well I trust you because you're nice. See, that's why there ain't no point of bein' nice. Shh. Glad he brings his own shoes most of the time. I hate him. I'm not gonna let bowling determine how my day goes. Lemme know if you want something, all right? - All right. - All right, brother. - Thank you. - Thank you, man. All right. All right. Doyle says you wanted to see me? Oh yeah. You are just the man I wanna see. Have a seat. Look, I know you know the drill on this, Harvey. Customer complaint again. This time she said you spit in her shoes. Come on, you know I didn't spit in her shoes. I don't know. All I do know is that you're gonna be mopping floors and scrubbing toilets. Doyle's moving up front. Are you serious? You wanna keep your job? Yeah, she won't like this one. Little stank bitch. Fuck! Son of a bitch. Where the hell's Randy? Lookin' for his girlfriend. When are you gonna let me cook in that oven of yours? I bet it's 1,000 degrees in there, all hot and steamy. What the fuck is wrong with you? You're disgusting. What the fuck? That little motherfucker. You okay, Madison? I just hate him. Yeah. Me too. I saw you talkin' to him and you looked a little upset. Just wanted to come check on you. He's just so creepy and he's old too. I'm just 18. He's like 40 or more. He's like my uncle. Gross, right? Right. Right. I just wish he would just stop talking about wanting to have sex with me or even implying it. I mean frankly, he scares me. Yeah, I just wish someone would filet his ass up or somethin'. What did you say? Oh shit. - Keith. - Hey, hey. Karen, c'mere. Come here, c'mere, c'mere. What now, Karen? That boy needs to get fired. Why? First of all, he said he wanted John dead. That sounds like a threat to me. He's just a kid. He's talking shit, all right? I'm sorry. - I'll address it. - That doesn't matter. Because then he wrote on the bathroom wall. What? I can't even tell you. It's so disgusting. I'll handle this. Hey. Harvey. Chill out, Harv. Hey Harvey, you know what Karen just told me, what she heard you say? I do. You know, I can't believe after our talk yesterday and even our talk this morning that we're having this talk again! That man is a danger to women. You should be on my side. Correction: I'm on the side of the bowling alley. One more screw up and you're fired. - But he's gonna hurt- - Fired! You know you want this. That little punk is in so much trouble. Well he should be. Did you hear what he said about you? What did he say? He said he thought he should be dead. Fuck. Little shit. Mm-hmm. Maybe we should teach that little punk a lesson. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Mm-hmm. - I'm down with that. Get that ketchup in there. Mm-hmm. Oh my god. He's gonna love this. Yup, yup, yup. That little motherfucker. Oh my god, he's gonna die. That little fuckface. Yeah, I can't wait to see his little fuckface when he sees that. Oh shit. What happened? What happened? Watch out. 'Kay, hold on. I'ma get you outta here. Just relax. I'ma turn this off. It's ketchup, you little shit. You're such an idiot. They don't come any dumber. You're a sick bastard, John Snyder. You're gonna get yours. Well in the meantime, clean this shit up, janitor boy. That was great. That was perfect. Dumb ass. You doin' better today, Madison? I'm fine. I wish he wouldn't come to practice for one day, but he's always here. I'm tellin' you guys like that should be dead. Guys like who? Guys like John. Come with me. I know you're an equal opportunity hater. You hate everyone and everything. I get it. This is your final warning. Here are your shoes, John. Boss, why are you actin' like this? You know he ain't a good guy. Hey. Hey, I don't know and I don't care, okay? You need to knock it off and I don't care if you gotta take care of your mother. I need to take care of this place and the people that work here. I'm gonna make this very crystal clear to you. When you're in this building, stop talkin' shit about people. Do you understand? Do you understand me? - Okay. - Thank you. God. I want more than shoes, pretty girl. Back up. Now. You all right, Madison? Yeah, I don't wanna talk about it. C'mere, babe. It's over here. What you doin' over there, hmm? It's all right here, baby. You like that, hmm? C'mon, lover. Mmm, damn. Mm-hmm. Oh no, what're you doin' over there, hmm? I will break your face. Mm-hmm. I love this song. I'm feelin' it. When you wanna gimme that, hmm? Get outta here? You're lookin' good, baby. Am I your girl? All right, you made it through the day without any trouble, Harvey. I'm proud of you. There's always tomorrow. One day at a time. Hey Jack. Hey Harvey, where you been? I thought you forgot about me. Nah, man. Thanks, man. You're one of the good ones. I don't know about that. I know I'm one check away from bein' where you are. Figured I might as well help you out, build up some good karma. Karma, shit. We both know karma's a bitch. Yeah. Go ahead. You sure? Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure. Why are you givin' your stuff away, Harvey? No, man. You aren't gonna do somethin' stupid, are ya? No. No, I'm just a little messed up in the head right now. Got a lot goin' on, Jack. I hear ya. If you been where I've been, it's hard to tell what's real and what's not. War does that to you? Life does that to ya, boy. I gotta go. Take care of yourself, Jack. Hey, you're doin' the Lord's work taking care of an old man like me. Why are you late again? Harvey. This isn't my beer. Where's my regular beer? Ma, just take it. I'm not in the mood. Why are you always screwing up? Are you fuckin' kiddin' me? I bring you beer every night and all you do is bitch and complain and I'm tired of it! - Don't talk to me like that. - Shut up! Shut up! Shut up. It's about time you start acting like a mother to me instead of me acting like a father to you. All right, Maddy. I'm outta here. Night, Doyle. You need anything before I go? No, I'm good. All right. Hey, drive safe. Hello Madison. I hate this town. I hate these people. I hate this place. I hate my life! What are you doin' here, John? We're closed right now. Did you forget something? I dropped my wallet. Can you help me find it? No, John. What the hell, John? I'm not waiting on you anymore. Help. Help, someone help me! Please. - Please, John. - Pretty little Madison. Please don't hurt me. - Please. - You can keep quiet. No one knows. No one's comin' for you anyway. Please. - Please don't hurt me. - Hey! - Hey John! - Help! - Someone help me! - Stop! Hey! I hate my job. I hate it. I hate my job. I hate John Snyder. I hate Karen. I hate Keith. I hate 'em all. Poor Madison. Poor Madison. She hates that job too. I'ma mess that place up. I'm gonna mess that place up. I'm gonna mess that place up. Oh god. Oh god. Oh god. Um. - He's dead. - No, no. - No, no, no, no. - I think he's dead. - You killed him. - No, no, no. - Hey, hey. - You killed him. Focus! Hey! No, no! Look, look at me. Look at me. Look, come with me to the back. We gotta get rid of the body. Why are we getting rid of the body? Hey, stop! Listen! Listen! Okay, I'm listening. Everything's gonna be all right, okay? Everything's gonna be all right. Okay, okay. - Fuck! - Okay. What the fuck? Help me. Karma's a bitch. You deserve this. Hey. Hey! Who's there? C'mon, c'mon. Get on the left. Get on the left. That left. - C'mon. - Okay, okay. C'mon, c'mon, c'mon. Flatten it out. Flatten it out. Flatten it out. Here, put this on top of that. Straighten it out. C'mon, I gotta move him. You're gonna have to help me. Look at me. I'm gonna roll them over now. Ready? Three, two, one. Roll him over. Roll him over. I can't do it. I can't do it. You can. You can. It's done. It's done. Cover him, cover him. Cover him. - Oh my god. - C'mon, c'mon. - Cover him, cover him. - Oh my god. Just throw it over. Throw it over. We're gonna have to drag him to the freezer. Ready? That's it. It's okay. That's okay. Ready? Help me. Help me. He's heavy. Three, two, one. Ready? C'mon, c'mon. - He's heavy. - I know he is! Help me. C'mon, this way. Freezer. This way. This way, this way. Come with me. Here, this way. I still don't get why we can't go to the police. You wanna be the accessory to murder? Well no, but I- - You do know we can go to jail, Madison. Well what are we supposed to do? There's a dead body right there! I don't know! I needed time to think! Make bleach water. I'll try to find a lighter. I don't know how to make bleach water. Can you just try to help me? Okay! - God. - Oh my god. There's something else you must see, Lion-O, the most important part of your heritage. Turn that damn thing off, Harvey! Is the mystic Sword of Omens and the source of our powers. Don't make me come in there. Harvey! Turn it off! All right. I feel sick to my stomach. But if I do need the Eye, how can I wake it up and let it know? There will be no need. The Eye will know it is needed before you do. I just wish there was another way. There is no other way, Cheetara. Today, Lion-O has come of age. Every Lord of the ThunderCats had to survive the trials. Cheers me up. The sun's up. I guess Snarf has told Lion-O what's in store for him by now. What did you do last night? You look awful, Harv. - If all goes well- - I don't know. Can't remember shit. Guess I had too much to drink. Lord of the ThunderCats. I don't want you drinkin' and drivin', you understand me? Stand back! Preachin' to the choir, mom. Now you went out like a fuckin' pig. Hey, don't throw up in my kitchen. I pay the fuckin' rent. - Still my house. - Sword of Omens, give me sight beyond sight. It's still my house. Hey sweetie, glad to see you workin' tonight. You're way nicer than that Harvey kid. Hey, where is your girlfriend? Will you stop asking me that? Believe me when she shows up, you're gonna be the first to know. Thanks a lot, pal. What? Harvey, you okay? Yeah, I got fucked up last night. Guess I had too much to drink. Drink this. It'll help. Sure you're okay? Hey, you're late. Wanna tell me why? No, not really. Hey, did I miss somethin'? - No. - No. No, we were just worried about you. - That's it. - 'Cause you're not late. Back to work. - Yup. - Okay. Shit. He's not fired? Guess you'll have to try harder. Where's Keith? In his office, I think. You don't want your shoes? You gotta practice. The tournament's coming. Thank you? Damn. Shit. Hey Keith. Hey. How are you, Karen? How you doin' today? Okay. Wanna cut to the chase, baby? I got a lotta work to do. Fine. Why's that boy still workin' here? I thought I made myself clear. First of all, that boy, Harvey, has worked here for a very long time. You do remember that his mom was my best friend. I owe her. You and I, we had a thing. That doesn't mean anything to you? He stays. For now. It's my bowling alley, Karen, not yours. And besides, that thing? Mm-hmm. We went out one time. Oh okay, one time. You weren't even that good anyway. - Oh, nice. - Mm-hmm. - Nice. - Yeah. - So you're gonna go there? - Yeah. Hey. You know, you're free to go bowling anywhere else. It's 90 minutes from here. Well then deal with it. Fuck! Fuck! Does anyone actually ever rent these things? I've never seen it. Kids. I hate kids. I know. Good mornin', Sheriff. Sheriff, what brings you here today? John Snyder's been reported missing by his wife. Nothing official yet. But I know he's a regular here, so I thought I'd ask around. That asshole's missin'? I'm sure he got what he deserves. Something you need to tell me, son? I mean the guy's an asshole, but he's a great bowler. I'm sure he'll turn it up, right Harv? Yeah, sure. Great bowler. Great guy. All right. Yeah, sure. If we see him or if we hear from him, we'll be sure to tell him to get in touch with you. Take my card. Thank you. Harvey. Yeah. You got a sec? What up, dawg? Did you do somethin' to John? Did I what? No, man. Are you crazy? I heard you said you wanted him dead or that someone should teach him a lesson. Not once but a few times. Do you know anything? Really? Do you? No. Madison? Yeah? Are you okay? I don't know. Why? Keith just told me to get everyone up front. Okay. Morning Doyle. Harvey. Hey, you know what's up with Keith and Madison? They've been actin' real weird lately. Is she in trouble? No idea. Isn't it you that's always in trouble? You think she's gettin' fired? No. That's probably still you. If Karen gets her way then. You okay, Mad? Yeah, why? You seem a bit off. No, I'm fine. It's just been a weird day with the sheriff and all. You don't have to worry about me, 'kay? All right. Goodnight. Why are you late again? Crazy shit happenin' today, Ma. What? Sheriff came by the alley. What did you do? Nothin'. Why do you always say it like that? 'Cause I know you, that's why. What did he want? I guess one of the regulars went missin'. He just came by to see if any one of us seen him or knew him or somethin'. Who? John Snyder. Shit. The one with darts in his face in your room? Yeah, so? You need to get rid of that shit now. For what? I ain't do nothin'. If the sheriff comes by asking questions and he sees your little collection. - The sheriff- - He's going to think you did it. - Sheriff ain't got- - Burn it. - He don't got a- - Now! He don't have a reason to come by. God, John just went missin' like he always does. Told you I ain't do nothin'. The kid'll never learn. We gotta dispose of the body. - Now. - Now. Now. C'mon, c'mon, c'mon. C'mon, come on. Push! I don't think I can go through. You're already in it. Push! One more time. Wait, c'mon. That's it. Get in the car. Get in the car. I can't believe we actually have to do this. Yeah, well we do, okay? And we need to stay calm. We just gotta find a place. Yeah and what are we supposed to do? Are we supposed to bury him, cut him up, burn him? Hey, wait. What? I don't know. Yeah, well that's obvious. Shh, just lemme think. Okay. Okay, all right. Fuck. That's it. That's it. Look, we drop him in the water. I know this area. - It's pretty deep. - Yeah and what if he floats? Would you just come out and help me? 'Kay. Okay, look. Are you ready? - Yeah, I'm ready. - Okay. Okay so look, just get a bunch of rocks. - Okay. - Big ones. - Okay. - Okay. 'Kay. Look, I don't see any of 'em. God, son of a bitch. - Look. - Fuck. Get a bunch of small ones. We have to weigh him down, okay? Okay, okay, okay, okay. - God. - Okay. - Madison. - What? Hey, look. I'm gonna drag the body to the edge, all right? And then we're gonna weigh him down and then we'll be able to push him into the water. Oh my god. Oh my god. No, no, no. Hey, stay with me. Stay with me. Stay with me. Stay with me. Stay with me. I'm with you. Okay. Fuck, I gotta answer this. - What do you mean? - Fuck. - Put that away! - It's Harvey. He's just checking up on me. What do you mean it's Harvey? I got a fucked up leg, okay? There are a lotta people out here. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Fuck, fuck. Just get the hell outta here, okay? - Okay. - Okay? Okay. Fuck. Fuck. C'mon, c'mon. C'mon, push. Push! - C'mon. - It's so heavy. C'mon, Madison. C'mon, this way. Shh, c'mon. Hurry up. C'mon. Here, here. Oh my god. Oh my god. God, come on! Let's go. Open up, Lucy. I know you're in there. He's not here. Well where the hell is he? How should I know? You're the bitch sleeping with him. Look, I know you hate me. But I really think there's somethin' wrong. It's John, okay? He disappears all the time. No, this is different. I don't know why but- - Fine. I'll tell you. Get the fuck off my property. Sheriff Davis, what can I do for you? John Snyder's missing. I need to interview on the record everyone that may have seen him. Oh. What's happening, Sheriff? Looks like John Snyder's officially missing person case. I'm sorry to hear that. He's one of our best customers. You all right there, Madison? Yeah. It's just you know, so scary. He's a regular here. Yeah. Well I'm gonna need everyone who was working here the last night he was seen to come down and gimme a statement tomorrow at noon. Sure, that would be Doyle, Madison, myself. And Harvey. Yeah, I'm on it. The hell's his problem? He's all right. I've known him for awhile. He's a little off but- - A little. Yeah, I know you don't like him. No, I don't. Why're they starin' over here? They starin' at you or they starin' at me? No, we just have to go to the Sheriff's office and give a statement, okay? He's worked here for a few years. He's okay. Yeah. Keep an eye on him. I will. I guess we'll see you tomorrow afternoon? Tomorrow at noon. Tomorrow at noon. Thank you. Why're you talkin' to me? Is it 'cause I was in juvie? I ain't been involved with the law since. Let's leave the past where it belongs, son. We're here to talk about John Snyder. You ever hear him fighting with anyone? I mean he said that he needs to be taught a lesson, but Harvey says that about a lotta people, bullies. Did Harvey ever say anything bad about John? Did he wanna hurt him? I mean not exactly. He pulled a prank on Harvey. Pretended he got his hand caught in the ball return, embarrassed him in front of everyone. When's the last time you saw John? I don't know, maybe four or five days ago. Actually, the day before you came in. Do you think that Harvey had something to do with John's disappearance? What? No, no. Harvey wouldn't hurt anyone. He's just one of those guys who hates life and everyone in it. You think that made Harvey angry enough to kill him? I don't know about that, but I'd want him gone. I'm just kinda scared. I've never done this before. Harvey hurt him? Sure. Harvey do it? I don't think so. Do you think he had something to do about John's disappearance? I mean of course he would want John dead but- - Harvey would be happy if John was gone. Did you kill John Snyder? That's what you wanted to ask me. Sure jumpin' to the point, I might as well too. So did you? No. Yeah, can I help you? Yeah, is John here? What? No, John isn't fucking here. Jesus. Why? I wanna know if I could help find him or somethin'. He's probably just off with one of his women again. He'll turn up when he's had enough. He always does. If you do see him, could you tell him to never fucking come home again? I'm changing the locks on that bastard. Hey, you know what people are saying? What? They're sayin' that kid Harvey killed John Snyder. Do you believe that shit? Yeah. Yeah, I do. There's somethin' wrong with that kid and he's been acting really weird lately. True. Get out! For what? Leave! Why? Because I heard you killed someone. From who? If you don't get out right now- - Get out. - That's it, man. I'm callin' the sheriff. And don't come back. You're home early. Where's my beer? Apparently I'm wanted for murder. What did you say? The sheriff thinks I killed John Snyder. They don't even have a dead body. They don't even know where he is. Doyle thinks I did it. The guys at the bar thinks I did it. I am gonna tell you right now. You need to get that shit off your walls. With our background if they see that shit, they're gonna assume you did it. Now. Fuck. You burn the body too? Oh. What're you talkin' 'bout? You heard me. It's just a fire. Let's go and talk inside. Haven't seen your mom in a long time. Be nice to say hello. Anita, you here? Harvey said I could say hello. Isn't that right, Harvey? I just wanna talk to you about John Snyder and your son's feud. You ever heard them fighting? Sheriff Davis, get the fuck outta my house. Now, Anita. There's no need to be hostile. It's all procedure. You know the drill. Exactly. I know it's a free country. You come back with a warrant if you got a cause. Until then, get out of my house. Harvey, it'd be a lot better for you if you'd just work with me. Work with you for what? I didn't do anything. I can take you to jail right now for destroying evidence. What evidence? I said I didn't do anything. I always get my man. Boy, that man has a lotta nerve comin' into this house. What did you do? Nothin', Ma. Did you kill somebody? I might be an asshole, but I ain't a killer. God. No door slammin' in my house! Oh shit. These are from the night I blacked out. Why do I have these? What'd I do? What are you doing? Nothin', Mama. Just cleanin' up. Do you need an attorney? I think I do, Ma. - Doyle. - What, Madison? I gotta run to the bathroom. Can you cover for me for like five minutes? You need five minutes? - Please. - Hurry up. I wanna get outta here. Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system. Doyle said you wanna see me. It's Harvey. He keeps texting. He won't stop. I wonder why. 'Cause we killed John. Shh! No, we didn't. So shouldn't we go tell him? No. What do you mean no? No. Look, he doesn't need to know anything. Besides if he does, he becomes an accessory too. Look, I don't want anything bad to happen to him. Do you? No, but I don't want anything bad happening to us. Of course you don't. Nothing bad happening to us. No, of course not. Have you forgotten that we can go to jail? Look, leave it be. Don't say anything to him. Repeat, we can go to jail. Do you understand? I understand. Fuck. Shit. Dammit. Fuck. I gotta work. Why can't I remember? What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do? I gotta retrace my steps. I hate my life! What're you doin' here, Harvey? You know Pops doesn't want you around. I found a few photos from a few nights back and when I was here and I can't remember shit. I wanted to know if you remembered anything. - Did I say- - You should go. Well did I do anything weird? - Like now. - Did I do anything crazy? Did I say anything to anyone? I mean it. Fuck you, bro. You know, I was with you the night it happened. Harvey? Harv? What's up? Are you okay? Maddy, I called you last night. I wanted to know what the sheriff said to you. I think he thinks I did it. What? There's no way. Why would you think that? You think I did it, don't you? No. Harvey, wait! 921. Hey, it really looks bad. Searching a car for a parking problem. Anything new on that end? Any idea what happened to him? - No. - Well it's looking like that- - All right, keep me posted. - Obviously at will. - Gonna get the little shit. But once I get him to the lab, we'll know more. I'm gonna go back and interview some witnesses, then we can go from there. Okay. Hey Sheriff? I'll call you back, Lou. Do you wanna come see this? What you got? Well sheriff, if I had to guess what happened to your vic, I'd say it was blunt force trauma to the back of the head. That is a whole mess. And with this level of decomp, there's no way I can give you an accurate time of death. Let's get him back to the lab. Lemme know when you have your report. All right, should be about a day or two. Does it look like John Snyder? Yeah, Sheriff. It does. I'll have Lucy come down and ID him. Hello? Hey. I thought you should know John's dead. He what? Confirmed it myself. Yeah. Just let the team know, okay? You know how much they meant to him. I'm so sorry. Where's my beer? It's just two days now, Harvey. The hell's wrong with you? I think I did somethin' bad, Ma. What're you talking about? Really bad. Like really bad. Tell me. I can't. I can't remember. That's the thing. I blacked out. Get me my stash. Let's talk about it. Here, Ma. I'm gonna take care of this on my own, all right? Harvey, let me help you. I'm your mother. Hey Madison. You good? Yeah. Well it's league day. We gotta get in there. Come on, we have to hurry. All right, I'll be in there. Just gimme a minute. Okay, see you in there? Yeah. No refunds, brother. Sorry. Yeah. Look, I gotta go. All right, man. Harvey, what's wrong, man? You look like you just seen a ghost. No, no. It's worse than that. I just needed someone to talk to, boss. So I thought maybe you. Yeah, sure. Shoot. I think I killed John Snyder. What? It happened the night I got blacked-out drunk, so I can't remember anything. But I keep havin' these flashbacks of me killin' him. You really think you did it? That's the thing, I don't know. I can't remember anything. I don't. Harvey, listen, you're a good man. But if you truly believe you did it, you need to go talk to the sheriff. But I could go to jail the rest of my life and I don't wanna go to jail. Listen, listen, Harvey. I know you're a good man. Listen, I know you couldn't live with yourself if you actually hurt somebody. Talk to the sheriff, turn yourself in. Let them find out the truth. Okay, boss. - Okay. - All right. Okay. How could you do that? How could you tell him to turn himself in? Shh, quiet! It's wrong and you know it. He'll be fine. There's no evidence pointing his way. Trust the process. What if he goes to jail because of us? He won't! He won't. Get back to work. You havin' a bad dream, boy? What are you doin' here, Jack? Well the better question is what are you doin' here? I think I killed someone, Jack. Did you? Really? D'you come to your senses yet? I need to go turn myself in to the sheriff. 449, code is a 20. 449, code 21. Thank you. 10-4. You. What're you doing here? I need to talk to you, sir. Sir now. You come confess? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 'Kay then. Follow me. Take your statement. Well? Tell me everything. All right, from the beginning? Yeah, that'd be good. Well John Snyder died at the bowling alley. How do you know? Because I killed him. How? We were fightin' and smashed his head in with a bowling ball. He fell to the ground and he was bleedin' a lot and I dragged his body out. What'd you do with it? I think I buried in it into a field. You think. How did it end up in the forest then? I don't know. I blacked out Are you sure you wanna confess to this? I have his lighter. I found it where I killed him. It had to been me. Well son, you're under arrest. Oh, you're back. We've located the body of John Snyder. It's now a murder investigation. We've arrested Harvey Miller. He's bein' held in lockup without bail. Yeah. Yeah, I always thought he was the killer. Can't believe they found the body in the forest. How do you know that? That information isn't public. Nope. Some of the people that are coming in said it. I'm gonna need all your employees to come down and do the official statements. Yeah. She okay? Yeah, yeah. I just have low blood sugar. The deputy will be calling you two. You need to get your shit together. Sheriff Davis. Been about three days. And? Official ruling on cause of death: a subdural hematoma. Thanks, Michelle. No problem. Send the file over to me as soon as possible. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Gimme 15 minutes. All right. We gotta go to the sheriff. Why? Wait, we can go to jail. I killed that guy. I mean it was to protect me. Isn't that kinda like self-defense? It's still a crime. Well it's the right thing to do, okay? I'd rather pay the price than have an innocent person do that. How can you live with that, Keith? Come on, man. How innocent is he really? He didn't kill someone. Let's go now. Hey, wait. Wait. Wait. Madison, can't let you do that. What is this? What is this, Keith? I hated that asshole. He deserved to die. Keith, I don't understand. Yeah? He's been bad for business since the start. I came in for a good life, a new life and he's been fuckin' up since day one! I'm sorry, Madison. No, no one can know anything. I can say I did it alone. You weren't involved. That won't work. Move! Okay, okay. All right. Keith served time for murder. Wonder if he had something to do with this. There's nothing there. Something doesn't make sense. What the fuck, Keith? What do you mean what the fuck, Keith? I thought you were with me! I'm not with you on this one. If you just listen to me, everything's gonna be fine. You got a gun to my fucking head, Keith. Turn around, move! - Get back there! - What the fuck? Listen, I'm sorry. I thought we were together on this! No, we're not. We're not. - You have no idea. - We're not together on this. You have no idea. We could go to jail! What the fuck? Just listen to me! Thought you were with me. Please, no. Come on, just listen to me. We're not sending an innocent person. - No! - I don't wanna go to jail. No, I don't either. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Come on! Look, it doesn't have to be like this, Maddy. You should've just listened to me! You didn't have to kill him, Keith. He was goin' to rape you! But you're gonna kill me. How is that any better? It's not! - Jesus Christ! - I know! Lemme think! - Fuck. - Put the gun down, Keith. Oh no. No. I can't. I know about your past. He was gonna hurt her. And now you're pulling a gun on her? She's right, that's not much better. You're letting an innocent kid take your rap. You're better than this, Keith. Put the gun down. You did the right thing. Here's your stuff. Looks like you killing John was all in your head, son. Thanks, Sheriff. You're welcome. Can I give you some advice? Yeah. Think before you speak. Good advice. You havin' a bad dream, boy?
