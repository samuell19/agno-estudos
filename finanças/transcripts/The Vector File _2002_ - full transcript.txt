Shut your computer off. Ah! Shit. 36.50. You're slowing up, kid. You do realize you're gonna kill yourself if you keep that up. It helps me relax. -I've never seen a man so relaxed. I'm going to hit the showers. Hey, uh, how about a drink later? Depends on what time I can get the realignment done. Well, it's about time. Have a nice shower? If you cared as much about your job as you do about your running, maybe we could all go home early. Don't panic, Ken. I'm onto it. It's coming through now. It's not bad, Jace. But still... Not good. Gerry! Gerry! What? It's your wife! Can't you tell I'm a bit busy? - Hello. - It's me. Listen, I've got a meeting tonight. Can you look after Mattie? I thought I was picking her up on Saturday morning. I know. I just found out about this. It's a last minute thing. I'm really busy.-So am I, Gerry. Otherwise, I wouldn't ask. I suppose you have more... Pressing engagements? Oh, well, she can stay at Sophie's place, then. No. I'll take her. No, don't do it if you don't want to. No, I do want to. I just... Need a little bit more notice next time, okay? We'll be there in 20 minutes. And you'll take her to school in the morning? -Yes. - 8:30 and no later. Fine. - Yes. Hmm. Gerald, we have come to the end of another totally unproductive day and I think it's time for some heavy drinking. I can't, Paul. I haven't finished the alignment. Hey, that can wait. It's our favorite. And Mattie's coming. Margaret changed the schedule on me yet again. Oh! Wives, huh? Well, ex-wives. Either way, you can't live with them, you can't shoot them. - Catch you tomorrow, then. - Sure. - And how you doing, missy? - Fine. Hey, what's this? Will you look at that? I always knew you were a little sweetie. There you go. - Thank you. - You'll spoil her. Oh, you can't love kids too much. Love won't fix cavities, George. Right there. - Hi, sweetie. - Hi, daddy. Look, Gerry, sorry about this. Oh, I love getting Mattie. I just need more than 20 minutes' notice. We'll work on that, all right? And you, I'll pick you up after school. Okay. - Have a good night, darling. - I love you, mommy! I love you, mommy! I made this for you today. - Hi, Mattie! - Hi! Hi, Stephanie. This is a beautiful horse. It's a giraffe. Look at the spots. It's a... Great giraffe. Do you like my new signature? - Signature? - Yeah, look. See, the "M" and then two "A's". Mathilda Ash Anderson. That's very clever. That's actually what they call a monogram. - What's that? - It's that. Listen, I've got some work to do. So... Why don't you draw me a picture until I'm finished, okay? Daddy, you promised, remember? Hmm... Did I remember? Let's see. Where's that? I don't know. Is that it? I'll see if I can get a little closer. That's my school! Wow, that's me! That is so cool. - Wait 'til I tell my friends. - Uh-uh... - Remember the deal? Top secret. - Oh... All right. I've got to go finish my work. Be good, okay? Monogram. Daddy, you've got mail! Daddy? - Hey, Jace. - Come on in. Daddy? Can you give me coordinates 0-0-3-4-5 by 4-4-2.25? No worries. Stand by. - Daddy? - Hey, honey. My picture won't print. I'll be there in a minute. I'm almost finished. Okay. Ohh... No! How's it going? Good. - See my picture? - It's a great giraffe. It's a horse. I knew that. Come on, let's go home. Get your bag. Can we get pizza? Saturday night is pizza night. You know that. - Can we get a horse? - To eat? No, to ride. I'd look after it. I'd feed it every day. I don't think I've got room for a horse. How about a rabbit? -Take a look at them stars, will you? Everyone in that building, you're staring at colored pictures of the world. It looks like a bucket of oil being poured into a tree. But out here, you got the full glory of nature. - Good night, George. - Good night, Mr. Anderson. - Good night, pumpkin. - Good night. Two, three, four... Five, six, seven, eight... Nine, 10, 11, 12... 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. Ready or not, here I come! I wonder where she's gone. She's not up here. So, I guess that means she's somewhere around here. Aha! She must be in my office. Hmm, can't seem to see her. I wonder if... You got to remember not to leave your foot sticking out. Whoa! Off to bed. Come in, control... Come in... Damn it. Now we have to rob the place. Shh... "The boy turned around and saw a wolf. "This time a real wolf coming out of the forest. "Wolf, he cried. Wolf! "But the people in the village just said, "Oh, no, we're not going to be fooled again. "They went back to work, and the wolf ate the boy all up." That's sad. Yeah, but it was his own fault. If you tell lies, people stop believing you. Then when you really want them to believe you, they won't. Well, I think they should have. Well, maybe they should. - Sweet dreams. I love you. - I love you, too, daddy. Daddy? When are we all going to live in the same house again? I don't know, sweetie. I don't know. - Night-night. - Night-night. I'm thirsty. You're going to make your old man old before his time. Better? Off to bed. What the hell are you doing? Mattie! - Daddy, what was... - Shh. Just like hide and seek, okay? Shh. - Daddy? - Shh. Damn it. Shh! Come on. Don't look. Put your seat belt on. Come on. Come on, baby! Get down! All right! All right, I'm coming! My god, Gerry, what's going on? I need your help. Yeah, come on in. Go upstairs. There you go, honey. Off to sleep. Are we all right? Of course we are. As snug as a bug in a rug. Now, go to sleep, baby. I might have killed one of them. I mean... I tripped and he tripped and he fell down the stairs and cracked his head open. And then there was the guy with the switchblade. I ran him over with the car, I, I didn't mean to, but... Gerry, the police will be there soon. Helen can look after Mattie but I think you and I should get going. - Just, uh, get changed. - Yeah. There's a third guy. - A guy in the van. - Gerry... It's going to be all right. I hit him and he rolled over the car... Well, he's not here. But, uh, there's a dead guy inside. Come on. I'll show you. The body was right here. It's gone. Mr. Anderson? Please, take a seat. Look, Mr. Anderson, we can't find any sign of a break-in. Everything looks pretty normal. Upstairs, downstairs. No, no... This is not normal. My place is never this clean. There were intruders, at least two of them. They were searching my office, it was trashed! My office has found nothing to indicate that. Look... When I caught them, they attacked me. One guy tripped, fell down the stairs, cracked his head, and blood was everywhere. The other one must have... Cleaned up afterwards? - You'd never seen these men before? - No. And you think they were looking for something? I told you, they were searching my files. What sort of job are you in, Mr. Anderson? I'm a geologist. Satellite observation. Listen, we'll send a forensic team around and see if we can find anything to support your story. Story? - What do you mean, story? - Don't mean anything. I'm just saying we'll send a team in to try and corroborate what you've told us. But, talk to my daughter. She was there. - Sorry we're late. - It's okay. Daddy, will the police find them? Yes. And then they'll lock them up and throw away the key. It's for your work. Oh, it's, it's beautiful. - Is that a horse? - Daddy! Give me a kiss. - I'll call you later. - Okay. Stay away from boys! Picasso. Hi, Gerry. Paul, what's going on? You weren't the only break-in last night. Somebody killed old George. It was a robbery, not much. Three computers. Looks like he disturbed them. They killed him for three computers. Okay! Sorry, folks, we have to clear this area! Okay. All personnel, head outside. We'll take it from there. Mr. Anderson! Could you wait back a moment, please, here? Sure. - I'll catch up with you in a minute. - Yeah, okay. Mr. Anderson, small world. How you feeling? A bit shaken. At least you're in better shape than that poor bugger out there. Mr. Anderson, what time did you finish work last night? About 7:30, 7:45. Anybody else in the building when you left? Last person we saw was George. - We? - I had my daughter with me. - You didn't come back later? - No. This was the instrument used to kill the guard. The handle's been wiped clean. Could you identify it for us, Mr. Anderson? Sure. It looks like one of mine. Look, the break-in here and the one at my house, they've got to be connected. That occurred to me. Gerry, is it possible that during the night you came back here and... Something happened, something maybe you didn't mean to happen but it happened... And you came up with this story about a break-in at your house. What I'm saying, Gerry, is, uh... Maybe you'd like to change your story. Are you suggesting that I broke in here, stole three computers and in the process murdered a security guard? What, I just made up that story about the break-in at my house? You're crazy. Are you accusing me of murder? We're not accusing anyone of anything yet, Gerry. I hope eventually we will be. Right now we're just following up leads... What about following up the leads on the attack on me? In my house! Did you talk to my daughter? Yes, we have. But she didn't see enough to corroborate your story. We'll let you know if anything turns up. Hey, you all right? No, I'm far from all right. First they don't believe me about the break-in at my place and now, they want to connect me to the murder and break-in here. - Oh, that is crazy. - That's what I said. Gerry Anderson. Why didn't you call me and tell me what happened? I have to hear it from Mattie and the police? - I didn't want to upset you. - You didn't want to upset me? What were you thinking? Gerry, they're investigating the murder of a security guard. What the hell are you involved in? I'm not involving in any... This has nothing to do with me. Well, let me tell you this, Mattie is not staying at your place until all of this is figured out. - This is not... - I can't talk right now. I'm late for an appointment. Shit! I have to go out for a while. Oh, Christ. Mag, I got to talk to you. -I'm in the middle of a meeting! To hell with your meetings! This is more important than your meetings. I can't talk about this here! I would never put you or Mattie at risk. Gerry, this is not about blame. This is about common sense. - I have to put her safety first. - Of course you do. - But that doesn't mean that... - What is going on? - I don't know. - I mean with you. With me? -Jesus, the police were asking me about your financial situation. About drugs. Drugs. I don't do drugs. You know I don't do drugs. They wanted to know whether you had a history of mental illness. Mental illness. - What'd you say? - I said no, of course! But do you think that... I'm an innocent victim in this! Maggie, this is me. Gerry. Your husband. Obsessed with land patterns, geological anomalies. I turned my back on Los Angeles so that I could be here with you and Mattie. Sit on the beach, loaf with the locals... I can't talk about this here. I'm with someone. Your client can wait for a few moments! It's not a client. Oh. I see. Is that your type? Does he know you're married? He's a colleague. -Dipping his pen in the company ink... - Gerry! Melvin is... - Melvin? At least he shows up on time. - And he's got charm. - I can see the charm. I thought we were supposed to be working on our marriage. Are you seeing someone? I, uh... I really should get back, Gerry. Take care of yourself. Where'd you get the suit, Melvin? - What? - Melvin. It's just so hard to find '80s retro these days. Listen, pal. I'm not some idiot. Your secret's safe with me. Gerry! I'm so sorry about Gerry. Would you, uh, like to come back to my place? Um, I don't think it's a good idea. I have to pick up Mattie soon. And, um, we're going to go away for a while. And you've just seen Gerry. Well, maybe. I'm sorry, Mel. - Is this seat taken? - Help yourself. Alone? Here on business with a few colleagues. The kind you don't want to socialize with. I understand. I, I travel mostly with colleagues. Plenty of company. Too much company. A couple months ago we were in Moscow and I just got sick of everyone. - Sonya Hagen. - Gerry Anderson. I work in Moscow. - But you're not Russian. - No, English. But I've worked there for the past few years. So, how did you enjoy Moscow? - You want the truth? - Please. The place I stayed was a cross between a playboy casino and a two-bit store. They're trying their best to look like Los Angeles. - So, where did you stay? - The Manhattan lounge. Strippers on the top floor, hookers in the foyer. And their sad little men selling medals from the great patriotic war. And hits from the Bee-Gees. The iron curtain came down and they're selling everything off for scrap. Can I get you a drink? Just as long as it's not vodka. Two beers. Now let me guess. Married with one child. - Separated. - Separated? Devoted to your... Your daughter. Yeah. I would have got the separated part right, too, if you weren't wearing your wedding ring. What? It's a fairly recent thing. But you're right about my... Daughter. Oh, my God... Look, Gerry, there's a quiet garden bar just up the road, not so noisy. Sounds great. This is it. Perhaps I should drive. Very responsible. Oh, shit! Drive! Drive, drive, drive! What the hell is going on, Gerry? - It's a long story. - Why don't you try me? I'm telling you, it's the same guy that broke into my house. I barely escaped with my daughter. I thought I ran the guy over with my car. You planning on doing business? Oh, I'm just a little nervous. You don't believe me. It was probably just a burglary. Why would these people be after you? I've been trying to figure that out myself. Maybe we photographed something off a satellite. You think that's what they want? It's possible. I'll be right back. So, who's "We"? Macquillan... The company I work for. I think we photographed something we weren't supposed to see. Like what? I haven't figured it out yet. Does that sound believable to you? It would sound believable in Moscow. But not here? You don't strike me as someone who would lie. Thank you. Um... You're the first person to say that. I'm really, really grateful. So, are my papers in order? Sorry about that. I, uh... I wasn't sure if you were who you said you were. The gun. -I see. So, you think I'm some sort of spy? Look, I'm sorry. I should go. Where can you go? - Perhaps you're spying. - Me? Perhaps you're not who you say you are. Perhaps I should go through your wallet. I'm afraid there's nothing more to me than meets the eye. Oh, I don't think so. You know, it's very sexy when a man... Let's a woman take the initiative. Now, this will help you speak the truth. It's all very simple, Gerry. But it's very serious. Where is the file that was sent to you from Moscow last night I don't know... You've got to tell me where the file is, Gerry. Did you copy it, did you print it? No file... Where is the file, Gerry? I get a lot of files. I don't know about any file. You have such pretty eyes. Typical. Okay, Mr. Anderson, let's see if your little pride and joy can save your skin. Mattie? Oh, my God... Who's there? Hello? Mommy? It's nothing, darling. It's all right. Hello? Oh, my God... I got it! Got what, Gerry? What if we photograph something off a satellite we weren't supposed to see? Ken, I was shot at last night. And then this girl drugged me and went through my briefcase. They think I've got something and they want to get rid of it. Gerry, the break-in here was a burglary, computers were stolen. No, that's what it was made to look like. But it wasn't. Why do you think they robbed my house? We've been talking. Maybe it's time you took a break. You've been through a fair bit in the last 24 hours, Gerry. I'm okay, just let me look at every photograph we've taken in the last month. No, I want you to leave. Ken, I want to get to the bottom of this. - You're not well. - I'm okay. Gerry, I'm officially asking you to leave the premises. Take a few days off, buddy. - Am I being suspended? - No, of course not. All I'm saying is go home, have a rest, go for a run. Trust me, buddy. This is for the best. I'll take care of this. - Who is it? - Gerry, it's me, Helen. - Hi. - How are you? Not too good. Come on in. Helen, why in God's name would I? Why would I break in to Mag's apartment? She thinks you're going through some sort of crisis. So I just break into her place? She's really worried, Gerry. She's worried. What about me? I can't even go to the police. - You believe me? - Of course. Do you think I broke into Mag's? No... But you're scared. Gerry, Paul is going to take Margaret and Mattie away for a while. We bought this new beach house at Park Rey beach. And Paul thought maybe the girls could get away for a few days. Get away from me? -Get away from whatever is going on. Gerry... I don't have to go with them. I could stay here... With you. Helen, uh... Things have changed. I can't do this anymore. Mattie gave me this. It's for you. Helen... - Hi, Daddy. - Hi, honey. I drew a story for you today. I know. I'm looking at it right now. It's really, really good. It's not real or anything. It's just a story. I know. Mommy says I can't come over this weekend. She says you're sick. Yeah. Yeah, I'm... I've got the flu. I don't want you to go getting it. I don't care. I want to come. No, sweetie, not this weekend. Anyway, you guys are going up to the beach and that's going to be a lot of fun. I don't want to go. I want to stay with you. I want to have pizza on Saturday night. Mom will buy you pizza. She always gets anchovies. I hate anchovies. Yeah, I'm sorry about that. But I'll be seeing you soon. Really soon, I promise. Okay? Okay, I love you. I love you, too. - Bye. - Bye. Have a nice... Nice trip. Hey, Mattie! You ready for the trip? Oh, my God. Shit. Come on, pick it up. Pick it up. Leave it. We are on holiday. Shit! Mr. Anderson. Going somewhere? Gerry. - What do you want? - More precisely, who? Unfortunately, she's not here. But her heart-rending little comic book is. All six pages of it. So you're one of them? Sadly, Sonya is not one of us. Watch them. Leon speaking. Mmm-hmm. I'm sorry you've been dragged into this, Gerry. It's a DNA code, isn't it? The mutated version of smallpox. To bio-terrorism this is a Holy Grail. We're talking plagues of biblical proportions. You think I'm involved in this? Someone set you up. Someone who knows the mafia can and will sell anything. - The mafia? - The Russian mafia. - These guys? - They're just rented thugs. Think, Gerry. Who did this? Someone clever. Someone close to you. If these men find Mattie... Oh, dear... We better call the police. You have another body on the floor. You know, I think we'll leave this one here. Hey, you got a vacuum cleaner? Mmm... Always remember to buckle up! Just relax and... Breathe deeply. I'll leave him for 10 minutes, then I'll strap the body. You look like a stunt man from a road movie. No, let's go. Thanks! I wouldn't worry about it, mate. Welcome... To our humble home. I like your style. Thanks. You know, I was kind of after a global welcome. Got the Italian marble, the Japanese vase, this table is antique Irish pine. And the mirror, the mirror's French. - 18th century. - Nice. Come on. I'll show you where you're gonna sleep. All right, now, you two can bunk down here. - That's lovely. - Yeah? I'm glad you like it. Helen and I will just be down the hall. But, um, why don't I show you the view? Paul, Mattie's in real danger. I don't know where you guys are, but as soon as you get this message, you have got to call me on my cell phone. Wow! This is beautiful! Well, I decided to live the rest of my life as a renaissance prince. And this is a Medici palace. This is what I want someday. Who says that money can't buy happiness? I'm trying to track down a business partner of mine. He just bought a place around Park Rey beach. Paul burton. Paul and Helen Burton. No? Okay. Hello? Yeah, I'm trying to track down an address for a friend of mine. What's the matter, Mattie? If Daddy's sick, we should be looking after him. Oh, sweetie. Let's go home soon. We will, darling. We will. Come down to the beach. See if you can find some treasure. All right. Nope, nope. I tried them. No, I've tried them, too. I've tried everyone. Thank you. Thank you very much! Damn it! Mattie's upset. She feels like we've deserted Gerry. Would you ever leave Paul? Only if I met someone else. ♪ Twinkle, twinkle, little star ♪ How I wonder what you are ♪ Up above the world so high ♪ Like a diamond in the sky ♪ Yes! Ken, Ken, this is security. Jace, Gerry Anderson. Gerry, they told me you're on leave. I was, but they said they were short-staffed, so what could I do? Well, for starters, you could tell them to shove it up their collective ass. Yeah, I should have done that. Listen, I need you to dial me up some coordinates. Yeah. Hold on just a second. Okay, stand by. I need 0-1-2-1.553 and 1-4-4.8. Here it comes. Thanks, Jace.-You're welcome, Mr. Anderson. Look what you've done. Hey, Mattie. You busy bee. That's great. Come on, sweetie. We're going to go back up to the house. Clever girl. Gerry, what the hell are you doing here? Ken, I have to tell you... I quit! Hey! Well, do something! Front gate from delta one. Code red. I repeat, code red! I'll catch him myself. Come on! Come on! You know what? I'm going to go into town and get some supplies. Can Mattie or I help? No. You stay here and relax. - I got a few things to do. - I'll come. Sure. See you soon. Oh, man. Shit! I've been sleeping with Gerry Anderson. I know. Fill her up, is it? God, tank of gas be worth more than your car, mister. Just fill her up. Bloody Americans. With the murder of the British tourist. The murder was reported earlier today. Police are looking for this man, Gerard Roderick Anderson, age 37. Anderson was last seen... - Excuse me! - Turn around. Get out of here. I said turn around. Oh! Oh, God... What do you want? Ow! Ohh! Run, Mattie, run! Mattie! Mattie, it's all right. There's nothing to be afraid of. Mattie? Mattie, it's just a game. It's your turn. Come out, come out, wherever you are. The game's up, sweetie. Shit! Come here! Mattie, come back. - Mattie! - Mattie! I'm all right. - Where is he? - I trapped him in the closet. Come on. Mattie! Mattie! Mattie! All right, okay. All right, okay. The fun's over. Stay calm, Mattie. Don't you hurt her! There'll be plenty of time for that later. It's Leon. I've got it, the whole thing. 60 pages. They're, uh, under control. I understand. Maggie. Mattie! Shit! You first! Oh! Daddy! Paul. Thank god. That's what friends are for, Gerry. Daddy, untie me... Like I said, Gerry... I'd take care of this. You know, none of this would have happened if you and Mattie hadn't been hanging around the station that night. You and your damn jogging. What? Gerry, every man has his price. The world is full of willing little bio-terrorists with big checkbooks. Moscow... It meant more to me than vodka and satellites. You? Well, at least I won't have to pay these guys. Too bad about that Sonya. She was cute, but problematic. How do you think you're going to get away with all of this? You know, you're taking good care of that body and I thank you. Turning up here, that was the master stroke. It's perfect. You see, I knew that you were going crazy. I tried to keep Mattie and Margaret away from you. I brought them up here to protect them, didn't I? But sadly, I couldn't stop your rampage. You shot them both before I could cut you down. It's better than perfect. Estranged husband kills wife and daughter. It happens every day. But, no, it gets even better. The ultimate poetic brilliance of the whole thing. I get to kill the bastard who's been fucking my wife! Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah! Hell hath no fury, Gerry. I never said anything about you to him. I never said anything about that. It's over. Gerry, I'm sorry you had to go through this. I suppose it was a tough one. We don't always get it right. Every now and then would be nice. We'll need a statement. Monday. I'll come in Monday. Right now I'm going to take my daughter home. That's how I found you guys. Your signature. Daddy, it's a monogram. I stand corrected. I, I believe it's my weekend. - Bye, darling. - Bye, mommy. Daddy, can we get pizza? Well, it's Saturday night and Saturday night is... Pizza night! Can we invite mom for pizza? Maggie? Do you want to join us for a pizza? We could get anchovies. Well, how can I refuse? Come on!
