Are you okay? This is the end of the honey moon. Ah, well... Here I am, I married a novelist. You'll be fine. Sure. Still, it's amazing... to be married with you, dear. I can't believe how happy that makes me. Could you repeat that? I'm not repeating it. Once more. No. Please, once more. Thank you. Now, you and me are a family, dear. There's something special about this town... it feels so comfortable. Kamakura is an amazing place. Time doesn't pass the way it does in Tokyo. You'll get used to it. Destiny: Kamakura Monogatari. Ah, wait, stop, stop. I think he's almost done. Prof, your honey moon was long enough... but now it's time to deliver. Absolutely. Dear? How is it? I'll let you guess. Are you stuck? That's it, I'm finally not cut for this job. How about pilot of the Enoshima train? You need to escape from reality for a while? Yes, Mr. Honda. Serve him saké until he's drunk... he'll fall asleep. He seems to have a hangover already. He has a hangover before a deadline? Anyway, you just have to hang on for an hour. You'll manage something. Right? Akiko you're so cold. I can't write so fast. I didn't figure it would be so hard. Coming. Really he's coming soon. Dear? Are you playing? Prof, I feel it coming, right? You know me, Mr. Honda. Right. I'm honored to receive your work, Master. Can't you say that less casually? You still have a hangover. I didn't drink much. Old age. Don't you feel odd? You should see a doctor. But you Prof, an advocate of celibacy. Here you are married to Miss Nakamura who is so much younger. You're jealous? Yes, I'll be that for a lifetime. Alright. Madam? Yes. I am leaving. Yes, yes. Bye. You seemed like old game partners. Yes Honda and I, we go way back. I feel so undervalued. You don't have to feel that way. You were right about his hangover. What was that? Just a kappa. Come on, that's a bad joke. This is Kamakura. These spirits have dwelt here for thousands of years ago. The kappa is quite common. With the evening, the spirits come out in legions. Don't say that. Don't say that. Don't say that, come on. I'm really uncomfortable with that. Hey, you don't say? Too bad you've chosen this place to settle. Ah, dear, I can't believe you. Come quick. What's wrong? Are you there? All clear. Just stay there. I shouldn't have said that. I told you I'd go out today. Alone in this house. What's wrong? You know. You are the lady of the house. You should affirm your status. Come back soon. Akiko, how old are you? 23. There. Don't enter the storage room. The storage room? That room on the north aisle. It's not a good place to snoop around. Okay. Please don't go there. Okay. Please don't. What? That's a bit unsettling. He looks like the Professor. I had to make a mess. Really? Here you are. Allow me. No, no. You're so kind. You've been here for 3 generation? You were the house helper of the Prof's grandfather. Sorry. You are? My name is Aunt Kin. I'm sorry I entered unannounced. It's okay. He went without even mentioning your existence. The young master is very clever... but sometimes he is forgetful. You're so right. He's not the man I knew before we got married. So many times I tidied that storage room. It's like his gentleman's den where he hides his passion. And I saw a number of disturbing objects. All three generations... have entertained a passion for ethnology. Is that so? Although you're so much younger... you consented to marry him... and I'm so grateful for that. I am grateful. His mother died when the young master was yet a child. The master followed her very soon after that. He's always led a lonely life. It is such a blessing to have you here. Did the professor ever consider marriage before? You can say that women were attracted to him... but he never settled for anyone. But then, you came along... and he married you. I used to come here when I was working for the publisher. And I thought "I'm going to marry that man". Fate is unfathomable. I'm home. Welcome back. Hey, Aunt Kin is here. Akiko, this is Aunt Kin. We're already acquainted now. Aunt Kin will be precious around the house. Thank you very much. What was that? That big collection of model trains? Did you enter there? Don't you think you could have told me? Ah, I didn't mention it? Uh? Uh? What is it? What's what? Behind your back. My back? Ah wait. One more train? You have tons of these. This is a new Tenshodo product. It's quality is worth Beyond the 9... What? $90? No. $900? Because it's die-cast, it's really worth it. If it was of brass it would reach $4, 000. I finally understand why there's no money for the house. You'll refrain for a while. Wait. Right? Even made of plastic? Even plastic models. Tropical fish? Look it's full already. A writer needs to feed his imagination. This is part of creation. I'm sure this was very expensive too. No, I got it for free. Impossible, it's gorgeous. It's probably a fang. It was in my hand when I was born. Are you lying again? But it is true. Right, Aunt Kin? Aunt Kin?! Are you hiding something else? What are you talking about? Dear? Why did I get married? What is that? Nothing, nothing. How about this. You should use a folder for these. No way. This is not mine. "The Returning of the Soul." Kotaki. This is an unpublished manuscript by Kotaki Ichishiro. It's is not complete. This is a rare item. What is it? It was in my storage room. Aunt Kin is 85 years old but she's so peppy. 85 years old? Well she doesn't like to tell her age. Her husband died in the war. But they'd marry at a young age in the past. That could be accurate. We're talking about the Russo-Japanese War (1905). If you do the math, 85 is way modest. She'd be more than a 100 years old? Hey, look at that. Nothing, let's keep walking. It looks very interesting. Let's have a look. Wait. Amazing. We don't have money. Don't run, Akiko. Good evening. Welcome, welcome. This is cheap and tasty, and good for health. My saké is delicious. There are so many things. Look, some people are doing cosplay. They're so good at it. They look so real. Is there an event today? This is the market for the spirits who live in Kamakura. Commonly called the 'night market'. Here you go again with your 'spirits'. You don't scare me. But it is common in Kamakura. Hey. Professor Isshiki. Hey, Mrs. Yuko. Such a great coincidence. Did you come shopping too? Kind of. And this lovely lady would be... your wife? Yes. It is a pleasure. Buy only from the specialized spirits... then you'll be sure to have excellent deals, here. Is that right? See you around. What is it? I can't tell you. Why? I'm not standing outside the toilet again. Oh, come on, I'm not scared anymore. Okay, I'll tell you. But don't come complaining. Eh? Look, look. Look at this. Look. Where do they craft such pieces? It's wonderful. This item is quite vulgar. I'm not buying it. Okay, dear buy it. Look at this young lady. Matsutake mushroom, $3 a plate. $3? Dear, look at this. This is only $3. I'll buy it. $3. You like it too. Wrap them please. Since you are so cute, there's a present. I give you a big one. Thank you. Please. Here, $3. Thank you for your patronage. Thanks, thanks. It's so cheap. This night market is wonderful. So tell me about that lady. About Yuko Seto? Don't freak out. She died last year. You are joking again. This is Kamakura where spirits and people live together. I'm upset. Don't be scared. Is it true? It's the truth? Yes, I am dead. It's okay. I'm sorry. She arrived in town recently. You have real feet too. You can touch me. You look like an ordinary person. At home my husband is bed stricken. It was impossible for me to leave him. Then I applied to the Bureau of Death. And they allowed to stay for a while. The Bureau of Death? You see, here in Kamakura... you can submit a Ghost Application. People who have no other way, in last resort... can go to the Bureau of Death. They get extra life energy. And here I am. This town has always been a favored residence for spirits. And so here spirits can materialize. So we can live like ordinary people. Shall this happen to us too when we're old? It's a bit early to discuss it. Thank you. In other words... If we stay in Kamakura... Even if I died first I could still take care of you, dear. You must submit the application. Let's be realistic, I'll probably die first. Please, dear, don't be in a rush to become a ghost. You'll have to stay with me until I die. Alright, will do so. They smell so good. Well, fine. Matsutake rice recipe. Perfect. Uh? That's... yesterday's matsutake. In miso soup? Why not? I didn't say that... usually you prepare matsutake roasted in a pot. Added to miso soup, you don't get all the perfume. Eh? Uh? Not bad at all. See? It's a good recipe. I'm so glad. Dear? Dear, dear? Hold on. No, no, don't. Dear. No way. Young master I can't let you go. What is this? They're from the night market. Wait, wait. This is a Matake mushroom. It is a poison for humans. Young master let me help you. We need to tap his back. Don't let him get out of his body. Dear. Oh. Aunt Kin, thank you. What is it? What is it? That was interesting. Oh, dear. You nearly died there. Was it the cause? I saw it somewhere in Kotaki's manuscript. Did you drink some? I didn't have time... you did drink some? Just a little. To taste it. Hold it fast. You'll have to be vigilant for a while. It's very easy to get out of one's body. Yes. I'm coming. I am inspector Inari, Kamakura Police Station. Is the professor at home? At home? Please wait a moment. Wait a minute. What? You're rolling such eyes. The police. Okay. Dear, did you do something wrong? Nothing more than usual. Ah, I forgot. I am a consultant for Kamakura Police. They have a Spirit Investigation Department. Spirit Investigation Department? It's a family tradition. It's Mr. Isshiki. The professor is here. Ah Chief Buddha. I'm sorry to have troubled you. It's okay. The victim's name Kanemitsu Reiko. She was running a vulgar trade. There is a sizable heritage. Professor. The murder weapon is probably this ashtray. A blow on the back of the head. Why did you call me? Our officer Mr. Osoreyama is in communication with the Great Beyond. He's conducting a questioning. Piling it up for mother. A second pile. An questioning channeling the spirits is always surprising. The Great Beyond is trying to talk to us. Mrs. Kanemitsu please tell us... Who killed you? I do not know. She's just been repeating that. Could you try to remember? Your testimony is crucial. I do not know. Why don't you know? Did you not witness it? I was hit from behind. That's it. In such case, only you can do something. Professor, please. Professor. Please don't expect too much. Knock, knock. What is it? I can't talk about this job. The victim is Mrs. Kanemitsu. When interrogated she was useless. She was lavishly spending her heritage. Who would be the most affected by that? After investigation, I found someone who would. She is not yet divorced but separated from her husband. At her death automatically... the heritage is transferred to his account. As long as she was alive he was very poor. Her husband killed her for money? No, no, it can't be. He's her husband after all. They are married. But their love had cooled off. Now, that would really be sad. It happens all the time. The murder took place on Sunday evening. But he had a solid alibi. As long a it stands, we don't have a case. Let's confirm... you were all watching TV together on Sunday night? Yes. Yes, Sunday evening, absolutely. Let me answer. We always do, on Sunday. Usually from about 6 to 10 o'clock. Did you see Mr. Kanemitsu leave the room? Well, Kazuo... from 7 he retired for an hour upstairs. He took the stairs. Upstairs. Yes, upstairs. Don't talk, just eat. So, he can't sneak out from there? Could we see the rooms upstairs? Sure. Kazuo dear. The police want to see your room. Uh? Sure, you're welcome. I'll be out playing Pachinko. How would a bunch of idiots solve this case? Uh? I'm sorry. Soon you'll be able to afford a much better house. It seems that he is very confident about his alibi. Can he use a rope from here? But he would be seen from the window downstairs. But even if he could do this and kill Mrs. Kanemitsu... an hour would not be sufficient. On a Sunday night the traffic on the road is awful because of tourists. Even if he took a taxi to the victim's home... It would take at least one and a half hour. So it's impossible. That is tricky. Wow, so close. It takes only 2MN from Wadazuka Station to the crime scene. From here, a 19MN bus ride to Koshigoeki Station. In 3MN he is back home. If he can do all that without being discovered... he can do it within one hour. If there is a traffic jam in Kamakura... Enoden train is much faster than driving. But there is a problem. While waiting for the train or the bus... he would have been seen by numerous people. Oh my god that is so close. What happened? Look how dangerous it is through there. Enoden line runs in very narrow places. The husband's house is also very close. That's right, that's it. What? He didn't take the train at Koshigoeki. Let's try from his room. Professor? What do you want to do? Just look. That's what he did. Professor. Professor. Professor. Akiko. Uh? The husband did it. Although they were married. It's a pity. People may live in couple and not love each other. Dear. How come you have all these views on couples? How come? Eh? Actually, my parents... No, it's nothing. Dear. It's in the past. It is still very present. That's something that you suffer now. It wouldn't solve anything. You'd be relieved. You're annoying me. Give me a break, I'm not talking about it. Dear. I'm sorry. It's forgotten. Are you crying? Not crying. I'll tell you. It's okay. Good evening. Welcome. It's been a while, professor. I fought with my wife. You're hiding here. But even though, we haven't seen you for so long. Has it been that long? Saké? Sure. Your wife is young. Weren't you a hardened bachelor? Well... I missed this place. Cheers. You receive them... yes, spirits are also coming lately. With their patronage I manage to keep it profitable. Professor Isshiki. Could it be? Yes. From now on we are people of the other side. So you are... Hey, you can see me? Yes. Because you almost died recently. Oh, you are in charge of Death. I'm the Agent of Death who takes them. My wife had been waiting for a long time. We can finally be together in the Great Beyond. You're going there walking? No we're using Enoden train. Enoden? Right after midnight... in that direction there is Mirage station... from there an old train goes to the Beyond once a day. Kotaki mentioned it too. What is it? Nothing. Could I go with you to see the train? I would like so much to see it. This is only for deceased persons... please, there must be a way... could I see it only from a distance? I'll go and get my wife to see it. It's right there, right? It's right after midnight. It's a small car. Eh. Come on. An old obsolete models from the Showa era. It's still running right here. You don't know what you're missing. I'm not a train nerd. Still running after so many years... that little machine is so heavy-duty. Look. They are so close. I wanted you to see them. I told you before. Yeah. I thought I should tell you. Although it's a family secret... I think you should know it. A secret? It often happens. You know my father was a university professor. So from time to time, he traveled far on assignments. Have a good trip. Then my mother would go out to some place every day. One day I was wondering, I followed my mother. Your lunch. I'm sorry to bother you every time. You're welcome. The weather is getting warmer. That's right. When got older, I tried know about that house. Who lived there. A writer called Kotaki Ichishiro lived there. Kotaki Ichishiro? Is the author of the manuscript you found in the storage room. He appeared like a comet. Left behind several masterpieces of fantasy literature and disappeared. He opened the way to a new branch of knowledge. Although his works are few. Some people call him a genius. He was a writer. And when I saw his manuscript at our home... I realized I had guessed right. The fact is... this man is probably my real father. You see... But there are also couples like them. Unlike my parents. Forget about it. I will be a good wife. Okay? It's starting. I wish you happiness. Take care of each other in the Beyond. So in fact you were sick? According to the doctor... I have only one month left. I can only laugh. How can I tell that to my wife and daughter. Satoko. I'm so worried about them. If they know I'm going to die. Hiroko is such a small girl. You're more worried about your family than yourself? Of course. Professor, if the same happened to you. How would your wife feel? Indeed. So many regrets. There's nothing I can do. Professor, please... After I'm gone... you must take care of my family. Oh, I heard something great the other day. In Kamakura, there is a last resort... You can be with your family for some time after you die. It is called a ghost application. Really? How do you apply? An Agent of Death will come when you die. Is that right? At that moment you have to negotiate with her. You don't believe me. You put it in salt for 2, 3 days. And then a while in the fridge... then bake it and back in the fridge for a few hours. This is a dish the young Master likes. What fish can I use? As long as it is white fish. However, beware of the refrigeration. He really likes weird dishes. What is that? Akiko, the rag. I'll have to re-write that. You want something? This. A marinated fish? What? Hello, this is Isshiki. Eh? Ehhhh? Hey, wait, wait. Please, apologies won't help it... no, please wait... This is useless. He said this work had been given to Prof Oosato, mine is redundant. It's bad news after bad news lately. What's wrong Aunt Kin? Master, did you bring home something ominous? Behave now. The God of Misery? THE God of Misery people commonly speak about? That's right. The old god no one loves. I started to loose luck and steadily I got poorer and poorer. Why did you choose our home. They were calling him 'professor, professor'. I thought he was rich, I followed him. Master, where did people say that? I don't remember that. Where did you hear that? I'm bond to confidentiality. I thought I could get back on my feet. I so looked forward to it. But I found your place. I really was mistaken. I'm sorry you don't find this house rich enough. The family I haunted before had a good standard. However hard I tried I couldn't jinx their luck. I tried with all my might, all my might. The family you were haunting? You were at the Kanemitsu's, right? Then you could have stopped that murder. I'm bond to confidentiality. Actually, I wasn't looking right at that moment. You're really useless. You want to test how useless I am? Easy now, stop. He didn't mean it. Now, I know why my luck was so bad. You're no match. You thought you could restrain a god of my caliber? But I could also protect you... I could see to it that you're unharmed. If you're grateful enough. I accept offerings. Alright, Akiko. This is called extortion. This is an unacceptable behavior. I will ask you to get out now. I see that you're very cold. You believe you could drive out an old man like me? Don't you have any compassion for elderly? You're not an elderly, you're a god. There are different types of gods. How do you pose as an elderly? But it's cold outside. Akiko. Right? Akiko, are you serious? What? God of Misery, breakfast. You called me. Come while breakfast is warm. Akiko. He's a guest after all. It's funny, we have a god as a guest. May I? Let's not waste that food. Please. Please sit down. Come this side. Thank you for the meal. Thank you for the meal. That bowl is so beautiful. A good deal from the dollar shop. Would you prefer bread? I've been the God of Misery for more than 800 years. It is the first time someone is so good to me. Oh come on, don't be emotional. Don't cry. Please don't cry. Akiko. Hey partner. You know what's going on? He's the real God of Misery. But we could always handle him, right? And anyway we're not that rich. He can't harm us much I really can't figure you out. This is not a compliment. As long as I'm with you dear, I don't mind being poor. Are you okay? You have some okonomiyaki too. Mr. Honda. Professor, you can see me? No way, you are... Mr. Honda isn't breathing. Please calm down. Please calm down, Madam. Dear. Daddy. Dear. Dad. It seems you're really gone. That was sudden. What's the plan? Usually my guests watch their own funeral and then we depart. Professor, that deal? The one you mentioned before. The ghost application? That's it. Yes, please, miss, I'm requesting it. My child is still young. There has to be a solution. In the old system... after submitting the ghost application. The Death Bureau was providing life energy. Was providing? But lately too many applications came in. We are financially bankrupt. Bankrupt? So for a while... we need to replenish Death's life energy... and now that energy can only be taken from your close ones. What does that mean? So Mr. Honda in your situation... it would mean to shorten the life of your wife and child. What? But that's totally useless. But they don't have to be family? It could as well be a close person. Don't let me down. Just a little slice... Ah, right what? There is another way. But still... What is it? But still… I can't stand this. In desperate situations... An emergency measure? We could just keep your current personality and transfer it into a spirit. Commonly known as 'Spirit Rebirth Package' but still… I do not recommend this... professor. Professor Isshiki. I'm Honda. I turned into this. Do you feed on souls? Since I turned into a spirit, I don't do that. However, this is a bit troublesome. Akiko will freak out. How can I meet with my family. Your daughter will be happy. To see me like this? Just saying, "I am your dad", she will faint. No wonder the "Spirit Rebirth Package" is not popular. So I have a request. Couldn't we go together to see how they are? Go on your own. As I am? Even if we're in Kamakura, we're in broad day light. Please, could you? I have a tight deadline. Mrs. Honda, please. When are you going to pay the rent? I am sorry. Before the end of the month. I know it's difficult now that you're alone... but if you don't pay I will have to evict you. That landlady I'm going to swallow her. Typical of a spirit. Money. I need to do something. I'm not a charity organization. Hiro-Chan, don't catch a cold. Get up quick. Your husband helped me a lot when he was alive. I don't have much money, but I hope I can help you. Mom. I am hungry. I'll pay the rent. I'll cook when I come back. You found money? Sorry, I caused you to worry. Come here. A man that your father helped, sent us money. Look at this letter, this is exactly your father's writing style. What is this? It's a Kamakura specialty, the pigeon cake. Like it? We didn't have this 800 years ago. It came from the West? It is made in Kamakura. Everything changes so fast. Look. What's in here? I'm really the God of Misery. I own nothing. Want to see it. Hey, let me see it. Let's see it. Nothing special. Hey, this is great. It has a great rustic feeling? A young person like you would like it? I like antique objects. So if I offered it to you... you would accept it? You would? But it has a sentimental value. Not at all, I want to offer you something. You won't be embarrassed? I'm glad but... it's not right. Look. You'll miss it when you eat. Oh, wait a minute. Look. If you could accept. I'd like to offer you this. Is this for me? An exchange. What's this? This is how I receive lists of designated candidates. I need to inflict a little punishment on them. My time here was so short. But I had a wonderful time with you. Are you leaving? You are really a strange person. You are always happy. But... I was too comfortable here. Comfort is poisonous for people like me. I wish you blessings and happiness. Where's the God of Misery? He's gone. Gone? Ah, that's great. What's this worthless piece? I exchanged it with the God of poverty. You really like old stuff. You'd eat from this? Of course, I'm fine with it. Even if he's rotten, he's a god. A God, well... he's the God of Misery, we know the legends. What is supposed to come? It's coming soon. Ah right, look. What? It's not much, it's for Mrs. Satoko. Uh? No, no, no. Don't. No, no, no. I know how much your earn. I feel bad. It's all right. I found a good job. A job? That's it. Here you are. Thank you for sending me back. Good night. What do you think about that. Well. Satoko and that man. Could it be? Aren't you jumping to conclusions. So she found someone she likes? It's great, it's really great. Me, you see. I would agree to it... it would be wonderful... if Satoko found someone she can rely on. I'd feel reassured. Maybe not really. You don't have to. What? You haven't noticed. Eh? Goodness you've developed so beautifully. Amazing. Eh? Yes, I get it. Is that right? But right now. My husband is not home. Yes, I'll tell him immediately yes, thank you. It's awful. What? What is that? Are you a spirit? See you again. Goodbye. Dear, it's awful. Akiko. Something awful. The publisher just called. Finally he'd like you to write that piece. Prof Oosato just gave it up. The deadline? For the day after tomorrow? Is that a joke? I'm not a machine. You'll refuse? Of course not, I'll do it. I'm nothing but a writer. What the hell. I lost it. No. No. What can I do? What can I do? Goodness. Dear. Come back later. Don't you know? Yes. How am I going to manage? It won't work this time. What will happen? Awful. It's not going up. I'll stay small. It's not working have a drink. Thank you. I'll get a balloon. Eh? Akiko? Would you like an ice cream? It's too cold? Dad could eat one. Uh? Can you give me a balloon? What? All of them? Yes. Thanks so much. Eh? I'm so glad. What about Akiko? She's often out recently. She went this morning. So it was her. Last Sunday... did Akiko go to Disneyland? No, we're always together on Sundays. What? So it's a mistake. Eh? Prof, are you tired? A sudden rush job. You're eyes are tired. Really? I'm tired. Do you finally accept the situation with Satoko? Accept the situation? I am truly grateful to that man. I need to learn to control my anger. It's great that you admit you feel anger. Alright then... alright, I'll go back now. Eh? You were supposed to to see Satoko. Sorry, I changed my mind. I'll give it a rain-check. What? No way. I'm looking forward to see you on Monday. Hiroko is also looking forward to it. I'm so glad. Goodbye. Thank you for sending me back. Good night. I am back. What is it? You. Are you dating Honda Satoko? What do you want from her? I'm not dating her yet. Satoko-San is just a colleague. Eh? But I'd like to marry her in the future. Marry her? I know she doesn't love me back but... one day she will change her mind. What did you say? Is that a problem? I can't let you. Give me a break. Don't touch Satoko. Don't come near her anymore. Or I'll kill you on the spot. Get it? Do you get it? It's awful. No. Eh? Absolutely not. What did you say? I love Satoko-San. I also consider Hiroko-Chan as my own child. If I can't see them anymore... I'd rather let you kill me. You idiot. Don't give me that line. I can see your game. Then just kill me. I will never run away. I'll stand my ground. Alright then... you asked for it. Eh? What the hell? It's a joke? Satoko... Hiroko... they're mine… They are my... you wanted to test that guy? What are you saying? Nonsense. Honda, you are a good person. Let's get drunk, tonight. Yes, drink yourselves to oblivion. Sorry. Ah, professor. Sorry about that, but... Eh? Something's happening on you. Something leaking from you. Please, it's not a good joke. I can see those sorts of things. No, no, I'm a spirit. The ghost is bad. Yes. You need an exorcism. Your life is in danger. Don't exaggerate. This is very serious. This is a magical mark. I use it for guests emergencies. I'll lend it to you. Just stick this at your door. You'll be safe. There. I'm back. Akiko. You heard me? Who... are you? Dear? I'm so glad. I can't open the door? You look like you saw a ghost. No, that is... Don't you think the door is broken? Eh? What is this? I can't come in. What is this? What? I hate that feeling. Akiko. Say... are you... a spirit? It's probably the case. Why? When did this happen? When I went out to fetch you at the bar... A red hand came on me, I fell... that's when my soul came out. A red hand? I thought it was a spirit prank. I searched for it. I couldn't find my body back. Now I'm confused. Right... now I'm a spirit. No, no. Sorry, I'm a bit late. Eh? There was a confusion with her time of death. I didn't see it coming. That's why I'm late. I'm sorry. You must be very upset. You were in that state for several days. What do you mean? Akiko... Yes. She has passed away. Wait. It can't be. Well, obviously she can't find her body. In other words, she's a ghost. We'll find her body. We'll find it and clear this. Dear, are you okay? Do you want the ghost application? Of course I'm applying. Of course, please. I want to be with the professor. Where is he? He's sleeping. This will have consequences consequences? Well... the fact is, it's been hectic lately. The life energy allotted to you... was taken from your husband. And so? Are you okay? I feel better. Don't worry. I'm not. What? I'm looking at the man I love. What is this? Akiko. Akiko? Hello, Akiko. Akiko. It is all my fault. I can't be responsible for shortening your life. So I decided to go to the Great Beyond. The short happiness we had... the days we spent together were wonderful. For that time we were a true couple. And since we have these wonderful memories... I think I'll be able to live well There. If there was a reincarnation. I'll wish to be your wife again in the next life. Please pay attention to your health. Take all that life that I didn't have. Akiko. You're not going to say goodbye? I left him a note. You're weird. Even as a ghosts, I'm cold. Dear? Why didn't you say goodbye? What are you doing? It's over. I wouldn't want to live long without you. Even if my life was shorter... I want to spend it with you. But I'm already a ghost. Even as a ghost... you'll always be yourself. You're my wife. Dear? Akiko? Dear. I am really happy. But you see... I'm determined to go Beyond. Akiko please give up. Don't take her away. I've decided. It was a difficult decision. So please let me go in peace. Dear, please. There's no time left. Our time was short... But I'm really happy we were husband and wife. I'm so glad you came here running. Too bad now... you won't remember me with a smile on my face. Dear. Thank you. Where did you go? You were here? I still wanted to find her body. Akiko is there? The situation was a bit strange. Right. I sent her properly to the Beyond. I couldn't protect her at all. I was obsessed with my deadline. You see Akiko, all the way on the trip... she talked about your memories. You were happy. But it's over... that's too early. It was just the beginning. That's true. She had a long life ahead. Yeah. Eh? Eh? Well, in any case... tell me. No, no. She wasn't supposed to go there so early. That was an odd situation. That was a hard decision. What kind of sloppy job is that? It wasn't sloppy. Since we didn't have a body, we had no choice. If you do that. You'll never see her again. People who commit suicide fall into a trap. They never travel to the Beyond. You had fun today? Which one did you like best? I met Mr. Frog. Yes, you did. I want to go again. Last Sunday... Did Akiko go to Disneyland? I searched for it but my body was gone. No way. That's it. That's it. I'm sorry to bother you with my private affairs. What are you saying? You helped us so much. Obviously it's coming from this neighborhood. Please. This is Akiko's sweater. It's for the investigation, don't be offended. I understand. I have little fox blood in me... but my sense of smell is accurate. Is it here? Or that way? It's coming from here. Your wife's... inspector Inari you are a true fox. Akiko. Is that right? An accident. At the end of the funeral... she suddenly came back like this. I didn't understand the situation at first. But she knew a lot about our private affairs. I was so worried about my child... when I realized I was a soul... I heard a voice saying "look here". This is where your wife's body was lying. And then… I just wanted to borrow it for a while. You call that a while? I had promised to take her to Disneyland... and to eat good things together. And then I would have said goodbye. And so I couldn't muster the courage. But... Now, I'm ready to say goodbye... I am looking for a way to return that body. You can't. Eh? Akiko. My wife's soul has been taken to the great Beyond. How could you do that? Professor. I am so sorry. I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. I am sorry. We're so sorry. We are so sorry. Alright, it's alright. Wait a little while. Confiscated until you meet your deadline. Wait. Enough. Careful with the wheels. Pleased to meet you. I'm Akiko Nakamura. I'm Prof Isshiki. "New Edition of the Customs of the Great Beyond." Young master, don't do it. Aunt Kin, my mind is set. I'm going to win back Akiko. Don't try that. No one has ever come back. Aunt Kin. I'm not the same person anymore. After knowing Akiko... rather than returning to my previous life... I'd rather risk my life. I understand. Since you're determined to do this. I can't stop you... but how exactly will you do that? In fact, there is a writer called Kotaki Ichishiro. He wrote about the travel to the Beyond. Originally I thought this was a fantasy novel. Actually everything written here is real. You remember what happened to me with that mushroom? The hero of this story used it too to go to the Beyond. But unfortunately he didn't finish his novel... although it's a superb work. So the only way to come back is to ask him. Please take this. This is Prof Kotaki's address in the Beyond. How did you acquire it? I'm sure you'll find out by yourself. I will guard the young master's body. The train for the Beyond is arriving. Professor. Eh? Eh? What are you doing? Quiet please. This is not something I can keep quiet about. You won't get away with that. I found Akiko's body. Eh? Really? The Beyond, final station. This is where the families come to greet them. So this is what the Beyond is like. It changes according to individual feelings. What you see here is how you wish to see it. Is that right? Originally, the Beyond is not such a bad place. It's deeply misunderstood by humans. This place is only a transit stage to the next life. You can take a little rest here. Except for those who committed evil in their lives. There? That's right. But it's just a way religions want to figure hell. Yes, it was that spirit. I knew it. What is it? Well. It's about Akiko's case. I thought there was something really fishy about it. Even the Death Bureau has investigated. And we suspect a name on our blacklist was responsible. Who is this guy? This guy is very tricky. He's The Rogue Spirit. The Rogue Spirit? When people reincarnate... they get rid of desire, selfishness and many other things. These instincts bundled up in a cluster that became that entity. That ominous being. That is... The Rogue Spirit. This thing is after Akiko. I must save her. Also I need an answer to a question. Please take me to this place. This Mr.Kotaki apparently lives here. Yes. Mom? Masakazu? Is that you? What happened? You scared me. Masakazu... Masakazu. Is that you? Eh? Did you die that young? I knew it, Kotaki Ichishiro is my father. I didn't want to know it. In my heart I trusted my mother wouldn't do that. But... now I feel betrayed. Wait a minute. What are you talking about? It's me, look. Look. You don't get it? The glasses. Look here. Look. Ehhhhhh? That's right, I'm your father. I didn't want to be exposed. I've been worrying all the time. Your grandfather was pressuring me to become a scholar. I was so opposed to it. I had to hide my life. But that left you with a sad memory. I'm sorry about that. Are you okay? The last chapter of "The Returning of the Soul"? You didn't write how to return from here. There must be a way. Did you read my novel? I admit I did. You really piqued my interest. Why do you think I stopped that novel? You too wanted to save mom. What a shock when we heard that you came to get your wife back. Like father, like son. Yes. What? But I didn't manage to bring back your mother. So I decided to settle here. But if you found her body. I think Akiko still has a chance. What should I do? What kind of spirit shook off Akiko's soul? He is called The Rogue Spirit. That one would be responsible? You used to make that face as a kid. Do not worry. We are not without recourse. Is that how you see the world? I heard that It changes according to individual feelings. That's right. So our only weapon is your power of imagination. And since you are a writer too... let's fight with our imagination. If you are a true couple... you'll get her back. It's possible. Akiko. Eh? Eh? Dear? Is that you, dear? Surprised? I came to get you back. But I'm dead, I can't go back. This can be overcome. I found your body. Shall I live with you again? Let's go back. Okay. But we can't. If he finds you here the Rogue Spirit will erase you. Akiko. How about these? Maybe today you would sign this? No way I'm signing this. You're so cold. Come back to your senses. Are you still waiting for... what's his name? He won't die before decades. Can you really wait for so long? Whatever you say. I do not want to marry you. Before you reincarnated... I was already waiting for you. I don't want to wait for your next reincarnation again. I managed to get you to the Beyond. I did it. We'll be together, that is our destiny. Masakazu is my only husband. What a bore. She's exactly as she was in her past life? Past life? Yes, hmm, that is... What are you talking about? What is it exactly. None of your business. Next time I'll delay your new birth... you'll have to marry me. You mean, the professor and I were married in the previous life? The previous life? Hear me... You two guys have been together since the 18th Century. This has happened every time. But now... next time I grab him I'll annihilate him. I'll swallow him in one gulp. You'll have to say goodbye forever. From our previous lives? Many, many times. That's why. When I first met you, I thought: "Finally, I met you." Our bond has been alive for so long. Now I'm mad. Be careful. I could smell a living human miles away. You thought you could hide? Give up Akiko. You will never succeed. People who hinder other people's love... deserve to be swallowed and disappear. I can finally get rid of you. I waited for a long time. Don't think about it... you started to love each other a long time ago. Did you just hit me again? Sorry I don't remember the previous blows. You don't remember this scar? And this scar? How about that broken tooth? That fang? This is it? You'll die for this. Centuries of grudge will come out now. Let's have it. I'm coming. Akiko, you'll have to trust me. Okay. Okay, let's go. What did you do? It's the power of imagination. Move aside. What a stupid behavior. When does the train go back? Go back? What are you saying? This is the Beyond. Once I tried to go there, I was automatically sent back. Forget about it. You can try and try, you'll come back here. What would you go there for anyway? Bring him to me, hurry up. You're all useless. But you can't go back. What can we do? You can't escape from me. You can't escape. It's over. Resistance is futile. Your imagination is used up. I get it. I will go back with you. Yeah, I know it. Come quick. Akiko. No matter what happens. I'll find you in the next life. Dear. I've decided I'd never let you go ever again. Dear. So boring. Now I'll annihilate you help. I want you to swear on your heart. That if I let go of this man, you will marry me. Let me go, Let me go. So? The man you love will disappear forever. Akiko. Come on, repeat my words. I, Isshiki Akiko... No. I, Isshiki Akiko... I, Isshiki Akiko... with The Rogue Spirit. I swear to be married for eternity. For eternity? Akiko don't. What a bother. Don't alright then. With The Rogue Spirit. I swear to be married... for... Akiko don't say it. For... for... it's the... the bowl of the God of Misery. What is this? This is... you guys. Why would humans possess such object? This is a god's item. It was given to me by a God. What did you say? She ran again. You did great. Thanks to you. Enjoy the rest of your life. Thank you. You too Miss Agent of Death. That was too hard. Thank you. Young master. Aunt Kin. We came to meet you. Who is she? It's beautifully repaired. Dear, your food. Can you pause your work for an while. It's not work, look. A simple crossword puzzle. Kotaki Ichishiro... anagram of... Isshiki Kotaro. That's how my dad changed his name to Kotaki Ichishiro. That's right. So Kotaki Ichishiro was my dad's pen name. That Kotaki Ichishiro I saw as a kid was my father disguised. Disguised? Grandpa wanted him to become an ethnologist... but dad's dream was to become a novelist. Mom always supported my dad. They had a secret hideaway for the two of them. That explains it all. My father's blood is flowing in me. Akiko. One day I'll have to go to the Beyond for good. Until then I'll support you like your mother did for your father. Will you? You're mean. You already showed me your full support. Let's eat while it's hot. Oh, grilled and cooled fish. There. Alright. Thank you for this meal. Looks delicious. Enjoy. So Delicious. A special thanks to the 囧夏字幕 Team for their subtitles.
