Here we are, fuzz, five miles out of rock creek. This is where we're supposed to look at our orders. What's the matter? Scared? Me? No, I ain't scared. Sealed orders usually means it's a tough assignment. We'll probably have to stand up to 50 or 60 bloodthirsty cutthroats, but it always makes the job more interesting, huh? Yeah. I'm ordered to take a vacation. At the El lobos ranch, four miles this side of rock creek. Very funny. Come across with the real orders, fuzzy. You've got the real orders. Marshal Conroy knew you'd kick up a ruckus, so-- and you were in on it? Look, chey, you haven't had a rest in three years, you won't be any good if you keep it up. I'll turn into a raving lunatic if I have to sit around. It's a nice, friendly place, and the owner's an old buddy of mine. Don't you worry about being bored. Let's go. There's no use stallin'. Hop off your horse, we're goin' in. Stay right where you are, both of you. Well, we were-- there's no jobs open. That's too bad. Come on, fuzzy. Now, wait a minute. We want to see Steve lobos. Steve lobos is dead, now get going. He's dead?! I'm sorry about your friend, fuzzy, but there's no point in stayin' now. I'm goin' in there and see whoever's running the place now. [ Gunshot ] [ Fuzzy coughing ] Brace up, fuzzy. It wasn't your fault things didn't work out. We'll head back to Bolton city and I'll explain to the marshal. No, you don't. I got my orders, and we're goin' back to rock creek and find another place to stay. Listen, fuzzy, why don't we give up and head back to Bolton city? Because you're under orders to take a vacation at the lobos ranch or a reasonable facsimile, or something like that. But you don't know any other place to stay. I'm goin' in the saloon and ask this Wilkins fella where we can put up. I'll wait here. And as soon as I get, you'll run out on me. Oh, no, you don't. Come in with me. Man: What's your hurry, baby? Don't be that way-- sit down. Let's me and you have a little talk, huh? Girl: I'll have to ask you to leave again, Mr. Bailey. Now, look, I'm a good customer. I buy all my drinks here and I pay hard cash. I think that entitles me to some consideration. It entitles you to what you pay for, not my company. Now please get out. Come here. You heard what the lady said. I heard her, my ears ain't bent over. But yours are gonna be if you don't mind your own business. I'm afraid he's had a nasty blow. Throw some water on him, he'll be all right. Look out! Hello, sheriff-- workin' hard? I never do. You last longer that way. You should last to be about 120. You know anything about what goes on around rock creek? I know about everything that goes on around rock creek. What do you know about the lobos ranch? I know it's a big place makin' money hand over fist. It was built up by Steve lobos who kicked the bucket and willed to a nephew from Chicago. A fella by the name of Wayne Dawson. Any other information you want? Yeah. How come he's so opposed to strangers? It's his property. I mean, do you think he might be up to something illega? I don't know, I never asked him. Maybe somebody should. Well, thanks for the information, sheriff. Take it easy now. I always do, Sonny, I always do. Chey, you were right. We should have stayed in Bolton city, gone out to whip wildcats, anything but this-- let's go home. Aren't you staying in rock creek, mister...? Davis, Cheyenne Davis. I don't know about staying, my partner can't seem to make up his mind. My mind's made up like a dance hall gal's face. We're going home, after what happened here and out at the ranch. He means the place we were supposed to put up at, the El lobos ranch. Do you know something about the place, miss? [ Nervously: ] No, no, not a thing. Thanks for taking care of fuzzy. Nice to have met you. I'm sure glad you made up your mind to leave. Who said anything about leaving? A little time here might do me some good. So that's it, the gal. Well, we're heading back to Bolton city, just like you wanted to. When I get an an order, I carry it out. We're going to the lobos ranch. It won't be a vacation, we're gonna get jobs. We go out there, we'll get shot. If we do, I'll insist in gettin' paid extra. Won't do you any good if you're a bull's-eye. Mr. Dawson? That's right. Could you use a couple of good cowhands? You'll have to see my foreman, he does all the hiring. And he's quite particular about who he hires. Yes, we found that out. Oh, you already talked to him? Yes. He asked US a lot of questions and said we were all right, but to check with you. If you're all right with him, you're all right with me. Take your horses 'round back, and then report to mccord. Mccord? Is he the foreman here? That's right. Mccord... Give me strength. Cheer up, fuzzy, we made it. We've been at this four hours steady-- how about a rest? You wanted to work-- now work! I'll teach you fellas going over my head to the boss. And don't let me catch either one of you over at the main house again. I can have a talk with Dawson after hours, can't I? You were hired to dig, not talk. Now come on, get that pick working. Put some life behind it! You, too! Well, fuzzy, how do you like the lobos ranch? Crazy about it. I love fire and brimstone, too. I'm gonna hit the sack and it's gonna take soldiers with Cannon to wake me up. Then I won't have to be quiet when I come in. Where you goin'? Over to the saloon for a while. Oh, so that's it. Couldn't be that pretty little gal, could it? It is. She knows something about this place that gives her the shivers every time she thinks of it. What I know about it gives me the shivers, too. But I'm going to bed and let myself unwind. Okay, fuzz, I'll see you in the morning. All right. Hey, chey! Wait for me! That's funny-- I never saw a saloon closed at this hour. There's a light on, maybe we can find out where the girl lives. [ Knocking ] Sorry, we're closed. It's Cheyenne Davis and fuzzy, can we come in? Didn't expect to find you here after hours. Yeah, how come this saloon closes so early? Is Wilkins sick? I'm Wilkins-- Faye Wilkins. You own this place? Yes, when my father died, this was all he left me. I have to keep it running until I can find a buyer. What was it you wanted to see me about? We wanted to talk to you about the lobos ranch. I know there's something about the place that bothers you, and it bothers US, too. I-I don't know anything about it. It's only a fair exchange of information we want-- maybe we can help you, too. Please don't ask me, I can't tell you. I don't mean to be forceful, miss, but it's against the law to conceal evidence. But Wayne Dawson will kill me, I know he will! We'll see that no harm comes to you. All right. Sit down. It all happened about six months ago. I had just put away the cash in the office safe... It was late... The place had been full of customers all evening, and I was terribly tired. Just as I started to leave... Who runs this place? I do, but we're closed for the night. We've had a long trip and we want some drinks. I'm sorry, you'll have to come back tomorrow. No. We want them now. You'll have to hurry, I've got to lock up. You'll lock up when I tell you to. Now get over there in our office. My friend and I have some business to talk about. You'll have to do your talking elsewhere. I said get back into your office! The sheriff will take care of you. You do just as I say. [ Muffled talking ] [ Gunshot ] You killed him! And you didn't see anything. I did, I saw you kill him! It was in self defense-- I said it was in self defense. I'm Wayne Dawson, I came out here from Chicago to take over some property my uncle Steve lobos left me. That man was my attorney. I never knew until tonight why he followed me out here, but he wanted that ranch-- he was gonna kill me to get it. He didn't try to kill you-- but you're not telling anybody-- you're keeping your mouth shut. If I see the an indication that you said anything, or are about to say something, I'll kill you. You're hurting my arm! You talk, and from that minute on, you'll never know when or where it'll happen. Some dark night on your way home, or maybe in your sleep. Please! I won't say anything! I promise I won't say anything! [ Crying ] Since then I've been afraid to stay open after dark. Tell me, are you sure the man was dead? I'm positive. And you have no idea who he was? No. Or where Dawson hid the body? No. Don't worry, miss Wilkins, we'll do everything we can to see that Dawson pays up, and that you're safe. Now don't you think you ought to see the little lady home? That wouldn't be much of a trip. You see, I live here-- I fixed up the office. Good idea--you better stay close to home. I'm sorry if I was a little upset. I feel much better now. Please let me know what happens. You're the star witness-- I'll have to keep in touch. Good night. Thisgonna be easier than I thought-- we get a good night's sleep, and first thing in the morning, we arrest Dawson for murder. Our star witness will tell the judge and the jury what she saw, and Mr. Wayne Dawson is no longer an active member of the human race. Sounds fine to hear you tell it, but the law says that in order to convict a man for murder, you've got to prove he killed someone. Well, didn't miss Wilkins see him kill someone? Yes, but Wayne Dawson could say that the man was only wounded, and that after bandaging the wound, his friend got up and walked away whistling "Dixie". So to prove it, we gotta find the body. A cinch. All we have to do is dig up every square inch of dirt in Arizona territory. Yeah, we better start looking for some fast leads. Let's talk in the morning, I'm going to sleep on my feet. The place to start is the lobos ranch--tonight. You think you could stay awake for a little burglary? [ Snoring ] Fuzzy? Wake up. You know what I think, chey? I think-- But what are we breaking into Dawson's house for? To try and find a copy of Steve lobos' will before Dawson and mccord find out we lied to get on the ranch. Something tells me I ought to be making out a will. What's the big idea? It's a long chance, but we're short on clues. Come on. [ Owl hooting ] "Last will and testament of Steve lobos..." "I do hearby will to the party of the first part "to the party of the second part "a piece of the part of the other part..." That's not the part I want. [ Thud ] [ Hears noises ] Chey! Chey! [ Hears moaning ] Hey, chey! Are you hurt? I guess not. I got a good look at that will-- let's get out of here. That might be Dawson. What do we do with this? Hold him and keep him quiet. You heard what the man said. Howdy. Do you belong here? Why, yes, I work here. Thought I'd come out and get some air. Yeah, it is kinda warm. I'm Jim Anderson-- postmaster up at rock creek. Glad to know you. Do me a favor-- take this letter up to the ranch house. It's special delivery for Wayne Dawson. Sure. Thanks, I'll owe you a favor. It's a deal. I had to clip him on the chin-- he was getting too hard to handle. Let's go someplace where we can talk. You want to leave that letter at the house? Later, maybe. All I could figure out in the will was that Wayne Dawson comes from Chicago, and his brother Matt lives in Denver. What's his brother doing in the will? When old Steve died, he left the place to both of 'em. Matt Dawson more than likely is one of them city fellers who wasn't keen on living at the ranch. It's more likely Wayne Dawson wasn't keen on sharing the ranch with Matt and shot him in the saloon. By Jasper, I believe you're right. Let's not jump at conclusions. Let's see what this says. It comes from a lawyer's office in Denver, where Matt lives. Listen to this: "We regret to inform you "that your brother Matt died of heart trouble yesterday. "Since there are no other surviving relatives of Steven lobos, "you are now full owner of the lobos property." Then it wasn't his brother that he killed? Mighty inconsiderate of Matt to kick the bucket at a time like this. If we coulda got him out here, maybe we coulda straighten this out. We are gonna get him to the ranch. You mean the dead man? Douse the fire and get some sleep, fast. We got to get started early. I told you not to disturb me till noon. It's about them two cowhands, they tried to Rob the house last night. Well, did you get them? They got away after stealing a special delivery letter that came for you from Denver. Oh, so you let 'em get away, huh? They jumped me from behind-- I've been tied up all night. Maybe Matt is coming here after all. If we is, we're through-- we gotta get that letter. Saddle up the horses. Now what are you gonna do? Write an invitation to the deceased inviting him to visit rock creek? Or write to marshal Conroy stating, "having a great time-- wish you were here." The postmaster promised me a favor. Meet me at the saloon. With pleasure. Now, don't forget to give that special delivery letter to Wayne Dawson when he comes. Sure thing, Cheyenne. Thanks for helping. Forget it--we're both working for the same boss, aren't we? Looking for me? Yes, I'm looking for you. And I demand to know by what right you had to give my special delivery to an unauthorized cowhand? He told me he was working for you. He was fired. Him and his goat-faced friend lied to get on the ranch. They're crooks. And I thought they looked like such respectable citizens-- at least the one I gave the letter to. Well, they aren't.We want that letter. Why didn't you say so? Mr. Davis dropped if off here this morning. Said he forgot to bring it up to your house. It's working. For the life of me I don't know why you let Dawson get his hands on that letter. Don't worry, fuzzy, I'm sure Cheyenne knows what he's doing. "My dear brother Wayne: I've been feeling better, "and on the advice of my doctor I am coming to live "on my share of the lobos ranch. "This should be an especially joyous reunion, "since we haven't seen each other since we were kids. "See you before noon on the 15th. "Your loving brother, Matt." The 15th's tomorrow morning. By tomorrow afternoon, we're through. Maybe and maybe not. He could have an accident on the way. Sure....a nice permanent accident. [ Chuckling ] Now maybe you'll let US in on why you had the postman give Wayne Dawson his letter. It was his envelope with a letter in it that I wrote over at the post office. And that's the real letter? That's right. I'll take charge of that, just in case. Now I'm beginning to understand Cheyenne's theory. The man I saw killed was the real Wayne Dawson. And the killer is a crook. He not only stole the ranch, but also the name of Wayne Dawson. Give you time and Faye's help and you'll figure it all out. I got it all figured out, except one thing-- how you gonna trap that phony Wayne Dawson? By getting somebody to play the part of Matt Dawson, somebody this Wayne Dawson has never seen. I know just the man-- he was a friend of my dad's. His name is delhaven, he lives in blairsville. It might be dangerous. I'm sure he wouldn't mind. Telegraph him to meet me at Boulder notch tomorrow morning at 11:00 for instructions. Come on fuzzy, we're going to the harness shop. Here you are, hand-made special. There's something extra for your trouble. Now, don't forget what you're supposed to do tomorrow. I'll handle the situation just as you explained, chey. Thanks again. What's the idea of having me stand guard-- are you robbing the place? No, I was a legitimate customer, and I paid a lot more than this was worth, too. Don't tell me-- it's a saddle for a midget. No, it's a gift for our friend Mr. Delhaven-- something for his stomach. Something for his stomach? He's gotta come in over the pass, and we're getting a good early start, so it looks like my brother will have his reunion after all. I know a good place to ambush him near Boulder notch. I hope your friend will be at Boulder notch. I'm sure he will. All right, fuzzy. A good spot, mccord-- we can't miss him. Looks like we're on time, there's Boulder notch. Yeah--i don't see any sign of delhaven. He'll be along. There's a man in a surrey-- it must be Matt Dawson. Look--somebody's after delhaven. Looks like Dawson and mccord-- what are we waitin' for? Heeyah! Put 'em down, this isn't a holdup-- are you delhaven? Yes, you must be Cheyenne and fuzzy. That's right. I didn't expect a reception like this. Neither did we--that was Wayne Dawson and his foreman. We're sure glad you got through all right. That Dawson fella's gettin' mighty desperate. Are you sure you want to go through with this? You don't think I'm gonna let those two scare me off, do you? Now, remember, you're the man from Denver. Yes, I know-- Mr. Dawson, in the flesh. That's right. Take this belt and be sure to wear it at all times. That's a good one-- the initial "m" for Matt. When you get to the lobos ranch, here's what I want you to do. Just our luck-- those two cowhands had to be out on the pass. I hope they didn't see US. They didn't see US, I'm sure of it. The only thing I'm sure of is that Matt Dawson will be here any minute. You can handle the situation. Remember Matt's letter saying you hadn't seen each other since you were kids? He can't prove you're not Wayne Dawson any more than anyone else can. But suppose he asks me something about the family? If he asks you, it means he doesn't know either. Give him any answer-- if he tells you somethin, agree with him. Oh, sure. And if I make any mistakes, it's been so long, I forgot. That's right. [ Carriage approaching ] Wayne! Well, Matt--you don't know how happy I am to see you. Come in and get comfortable and tell me about your trip. Most exciting-- you'll never believe this, but I was attacked by Indians. I'm sure they were Indians. Takes more than a redskin to stop a Dawson, eh, Matt? I'm so glad you came through all right. Take care of my brother's team and bring his bags in. Oh, uh, I forgot, this is my-- I mean our foreman, Bart mccord. Glad to know you, Mr. Mccord. You must show me around the place sometime soon. I will. You have no idea how happy I was when I saw your letter. About you being well enough to come out here and live. A marvelous new doctor-- he told me this outdoor life would keep me till I was 100. Most encouraging. Nice place uncle Steve left US here, Wayne. We must be making lots of money. Things aren't always what they seem. The fact is, we're operating at a loss. You know what the real thrill was in getting well enough to come here? Not the money-- the thrill of seeing you again after all these years. Yes, I understand-- it has been a long time. Since you were 14 and I was 8. Things didn't go so well for dad and you had to go live with uncle Willis in Chicago. Yeah, I know, but that's been so long ago, it's just a vague memory. But of course you remember dad giving US a belt apiece with our initials on them? Oh, yes, sure. I remember that. And making US promise we'd wear thm so long as we live? Yes, yes, of course I remember. Well, I've never been without my belt, except for when it was being made larger. Neither have I. Fact is, mine is in the harness makers being made a little larger right now. You know, age adds a little here. I feel so undressed without it, but I'll have it back by tomorrow, sure. Do you mind if I go to my room? The trip was just a little tiring. Oh course not, Matt, my dear boy. Your room is the second one down there to the left. How'd you make out? Saddle up the horses-- we're going to the harness makers. If Wayne Dawson had hurt Mr. Delhaven, I wouldn't care-- I'd tell what I know to everyone. I don't think you have to put yourself in danger. Wayne Dawson will hang himself with that belt. But suppose Mr. Delhaven does expose Dawson as a fake-- won't we still have to find the body to convict him? We won't have to find it-- Dawson will lead US to it. It's a simple job-- a letter "w" carved out of silver. I'll draw it for you-- I'm sorry, but I'm backed up-- I couldn't get to it for months. You make it for me by tomorrow or anytime during the week, and I'll give you an extra hundred dollars. Look, I couldn't do it for you at any price. There's no silver-- tried to get some myself, wrote dealers all over the territory. Somethin' to do with the government. Are you positive? You don't think I'd turn down a hundred dollars, do yo? Nice work, Lem. You really convinced him with that government yarn. Fast thinkin'. You gotta do some fast thinkin' when you're lookin' for a reason to turn down $100. I hope to tell ya. Boswick's stubborn-- what he needs is a good beatin'. I'll get him to make that belt for you. Wait--i don't need boswick. I'll get that belt off of Wayne Dawson's body, and it'll be the real thing. I wouldn't be in such a hurry to go diggin'-- let me work him over, he'll come around. Well, it's worth a try, if you think you can do it. You go on back to the ranch. Well, mccord, wh-what are you doing here? Never mind me, what about you? Havin' my harness fixed. I don't see your horse around anyplace. I plumb forgot, he's around the back. You sneaked into town, is that it? I'm gettin' to the bottom of this. You can't shove me around! Has anybody been in here since I left? No--what's the matter? I get nervous spells-- I think it's the heat. You don't mind, do you? You can bet I fixed that mccord so he's probably still runnin'. Are you positive mccord didn't get to boswick? I'm counting on you. Cross my heart and hope to swallow a pitchfork. Fuzzy, I'm leaving Faye in your care-- you stay here and protect her. Oh, now, chey-- you know how women and I get along. You don't want to stay and protect her, come with me. It ain't that I don't want to protect the lady, but...where you goin'? If Dawson couldn't get the belt from boswisk, he'll have to take it off the body, and I mean to follow him out to where he buried him. Hey, chey! I'd never run out on you, but Faye here needs protection. I thought you'd see it that way. Where's the chump who calls himself Matt Dawson? What do you mean "calls himself" Matt Dawson? Matt Dawson is dead. Is that what you found out from boswick? I didn't have to see boswick. I found this letter on one of those cowpokes, that goat-faced one. The letter we got from the postmaster was a phony-- there's the real one. So that's it, huh? You keep a watch here. I'll look in his bags and see if I can find out who he really is. Got him dead to rights-- found that telegram. "Mr. Delhaven: Need your help desperately. "Meet marshal Cheyenne Davis and his pal fuzzy "at Boulder notch tomorrow 11:00 A.M. "He will explain everything. "Don't fail me. Love, Faye Wilkins." So she told that marshal, huh? You take that girl out to the cabin. I'll finish her and that marshal off at the same time. I'll pick some men up and go after the girl. Yeah, but use the back door. Cheyenne's probably watching the house. And when you go after the girl, use the back trail. I searched everywhere, it oughta be around here somewhere. Fuzzy, what in the world are you looking for? Oh, that letter about Dawson bein' dead. I can't find it. You don't think Wayne Dawson found it, do you? Well, not Dawson, but his foreman, mccord. When we was rasslin' in front of boswick's, i-- hey, I gotta go see somebody. This is for you, miss Wilkins. Just a minute-- who gave you this? I don't know who he is. He just gave it to me and said he was a messenger from Cheyenne somethin' and it was important. Oh, thanks. Where's Cheyenne? What is this? A trap, and neatly sprung, if I do say so myself. Johnson-- come here! Where is Cheyenne? He'll be here, just be calm, you'll see him. Place your men at the windows. They'll make a nice reception committee for our nosy marshal. And see that the lady is made comfortable until our friend shows up. All right, hold it. Now put your hands up. Oh, hello, Cheyenne. Came out to see where the body was buried, huh? I'm surprised at you, marshal-- walking right into your own trap. I haven't walked into it yet, Dawson, or whatever your name is. Just keep on calling me Dawson, until my men in the cabin start to fire. You don't think you can get away with killing a u.S. Marshal, do you? I think I will, if I can prove he's crooked. I have the proof, you know-- robbing the mail, using the mail as a fraud, and sending an impostor out here to claim my property. That won't be much proof from you. You won't be able to contradict me-- you won't be there. If they shoot, you'll be dead before a shot ever comes from that cabin. [ Gunshot ] Drop it! Sheriff! Chey's in trouble! I had an awful time tryin' to catch you. Get a rope and let's tie him up. You don't need to tie him up. Nice place, this ranch. Why don't you sell your business, Faye, and buy it? Why do you think I've been looking it over? The next time you come to rock creek for a vacation, the lobos ranch will be a real place to get a rest. It'd be kinda nice to have miss Wilkins here waitin' for US, instead of that mccord fella. Thank you for your hospitality, Faye. Now we have to go to Bolton city and report to marshal Conroy. Before you go, I'd like to say one thing. I'm gettin' kinda old and useless, I guess, why don't you stay here and take over the sheriff's job? No, thanks. Maybe fuzzy would like the job. No sirree. The marshal's office needs me. I'm the toughest man they got workin' for 'em. Besides, I'm the best rider they got. [ Horse whinnies ] Hey--who turned my horse around?
