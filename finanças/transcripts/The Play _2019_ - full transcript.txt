A MOVIE ABOUT LOVE AND SEX FOR PIANO QUINTET IN FIVE ACTS ONE PROLOGUE ONE INTERLUDE AND ONE EPILOGUE PROLOGUE I wish for this winter to never end. For snow to cut the roads. For an avalanche to fall on the roof. For the whole world to disappear. For Hippolytus to become again the child who spied on me while I dressed. For him to mess up the closets searching for coins. For him not to know the taste of beer, or cigarettes in girls' mouths. Phaedra, don't say that. How I wish for Theseus to never return from his trip, for a sharp curve to throw his car into a tree. You can't be serious. Come on. Many people would be happy. He ruined half the town. He pushed them to sell their coupons, and then made a deal with the Germans for the best business. He promised me we'd be millionaires. He doesn't care that the others are left with a pile of useless paper. Nobody forced them to sell. You sound like him. Don't change the subject, Phaedra. You're talking about your stepson. About your husband. You're right, Eustachia. You can't understand how I feel. The guilt and anger I have inside. How I wish I could hold him in my arms again. Are you crazy? He's your son. Denisa, we need to talk. - Honza, please. - Leave her alone. - I love you! - Honza, stop it! - Denisa, I love you! - Honza, stop it! ACT I THE CASTING SIX WEEKS BEFORE THE PREMIERE It's not the first time. He asked me to rehearse the love scene with Hippolytus, but without Hippolytus. - Did you meet here in the theater? - Yeah, in the rehearsal room. He tried to kiss me. He said he needed to identify with the character. Honza would leave as soon as... You know he can't leave the town. I don't want to meet him on the street. Let me go. I can't let you go. Not in the middle of rehearsals. You're under contract. I could sue you. You, him and the theater. You knew about this for months and did nothing. If I pay them both off, I won't have any money for another actor. If you're deciding who to pay, I hope it's her. It's not that simple. We're firing Honza. Denisa's leaving on her own. Are you serious? Maybe she's not leaving by choice, but it's not like he raped her. Luckily not. - Will you give him the milk? - I made it too hot. I'll do it in a bit. Honza is crazy, but we don't have to crucify him. He just fell in love. Sending photos of your dick at 2am means you're in love? We've all been through it. You too? I've fallen in love with girls that didn't love me. Did you send them pictures? It wasn't possible. We didn't have phones with cameras. So I didn't. Nothing happened, so give her the money and be done with it. He ruined her play. She lost the lead role. I'm the one with a ruined play. A month before the premiere I lose my two lead actors. And who can I afford to hire? Don't exaggerate. You still have six weeks. Six weeks or four, it's the same. Financially, we may not make it to the end of the season. Did you tell Janecek I want to see him? - Katerina. - What? Did you tell Janecek about the cafe? Not yet. We haven't talked about cultural projects yet. This is for profit. I don't want a cultural subsidy. Yeah. OK. I wish for this winter to never end. For snow to cut the roads. For an avalanche to fall on the roots... Again. How I wish for Theseus... Theseus... to never return from his trip. For a sharp curve to throw his car into a tree. I wish... I wish for this winter to never end. For snow to cut the roads. For an avalanche... Stop! Katerina? She's the one you liked. The one from Tuesday. I liked the one from Thursday. The one from Tuesday. Don't worry too much. The one from Thursday, I'm sure. Petr, Katerina's here and she needs to talk to you. - I looked for her everywhere. - What do you want me to do? - Tell her I'm busy. - OK. - Hold on. - Yeah. Give her the car keys. Excuse me. One more time? Yeah. Sure. This time from the beginning. From Eustachia? From the arrival of Theseus. And don't touch each other this time. OK. Good morning, Phaedra. Fuck. And what about trying Marketa? OK. She'll be thrilled. But don't tell her she got it until I'm sure there's no other way. And how do you like it? - What? - The play. It's good. Interesting. - You don't like it. - I do. I said it's interesting. When people say "interesting", it means they don't like it. I like it, but? maybe it's too risky for a city theater. Why risky? The staging, the dialogue, the music, it's all kind of old-fashioned. I want them to look like Greek statues. I know. I'm just saying it's risky. Jesus, I'm fucked. It's your first play in three years. You can do whatever you want. I was waiting for you. - I told Pavel to tell you... - I know, but I wanted to talk to you. You should have gone home. Can I talk to you? Katerina, I'm working. I'll be home in a few hours. I'll wait for you upstairs. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Thanks. I don't want this to happen again. Today's the last day of casting. We haven't found anyone. I've been asking you for a week to take care of Alex. I wasn't so short of time a week ago. So your work is more important than mine. - At the moment it is. - Because it's your work. - No, because it makes our living. - Excuse me. Councilman Janh wants to talk to you. - Did Pavel give you the keys? - Yes, I got them. - Bye. - Bye. I don't understand. Are you asking me to cancel the play? Not at all, but I understand it's a classical play, isn't it? Yeah, but I'm adapting it from a version by Unamuno. A kind of Spanish Kafka. I guess neither version talks about the sale of State enterprises. You added that, right? What do you know about those years? You were a baby. That doesn't mean I can't write about it. I value your work. But not everyone has the same taste. I suggest changing a few things here and there. Some of my colleagues may think it's about them. But I don't name anyone. They're not so stupid, Mr. Director. I have to go. Thanks for the coffee. Don't forget, in two weeks we'll be looking at your request for a budget increase. Add some graphs, some color, some photos... Mr. Mayor likes that. Lots of colors and numbers. Make it look nice. OK. We'll make it look nice. It would be a pity if the Council doesn't approve this increase. Are you leaving? Goodbye. Excuse me. Something happened? Nothing. Nothing yet. - We're closed. - I'm looking for Petr Capek. - Excuse me? - I'm looking for Petr Capek. - What for? - For the casting. - Casting finished at 5pm. - I know. I'm sorry. I took the wrong bus. - It's freezing. - You're too late. I'm sorry. You sent your resume by mail? - Yes. - I remember you. So? - So what? - Did I get the role? No, it's a lead role. We can't cast it without an audition. So let's do it now. I know the role by heart. Everything? With all my heart. Thanks. You really know it by heart? Yes. Under the light. Which scene? The opening monologue. Should I also play Eustachia's part, or just Phaedra's? Just Phaedra. So from? "I wish for this winter to never end." Right? I wish for this winter to never end. For the snow to cut the roads. For an avalanche to fall... Sorry... What's your name? Karolina. Karolina, talk to the audience. From the beginning, please. Sorry. OK. I wish for this winter to never end. For the snow to cut the roads. Don't walk. You're a statue talking to the audience. I wish for this winter to never end. For the snow to cut the roads. For an avalanche to fall on the roof. For the whole world to disappear. For Hippolytus to become again the child that spied on me while I dressed. For him to mess up the closets searching for coins. For him not to know the taste of beer, or cigarettes in girls' mouths. How I wish for Theseus to never return from his trip, for a sharp curve to throw his car into a tree. How I wish! Forget it. It's pointless to wish for someone else's unhappiness. It's very sad to wait for a disaster, to make up for my lack of courage. Phaedra, don't say that. ACT II THE REPLACEMENT FOUR WEEKS BEFORE THE PREMIERE Yeah? What are you looking at? There's a cat. Yeah. I've known her for years. She's pretty. Here are the documents for the extra funding request. Budget, balance, projections, etc. Should I print it in color? Black and white is OK. That's the least of our worries. We have bigger problems. Budget? I'm betting everything on the cafe. Do you want me to include the cafe in the next year's projections? Let's see how it goes with Janecek first. OK, good. See you in a bit. There's schnitzel for lunch. Great. Hello. Excuse me. Are you Mr. Janecek? I'm Petr Capek. Katerina's husband. Nice to meet you. I'm sorry. I lost track of time. We're a few weeks from a premiere. Petr, please, we're working. Yeah. Sorry. - I'll take him. - No, it's fine. - But I can take him now. - Please. I can handle it, OK? As you want. Maybe a diaper change? No, it's not necessary. Did Katerina tell you about our cafe in the theater? A cafe in the theater? Kladno doesn't have a cafe that could host concerts, readings, etc. Sure, good. Petr, really, you're interrupting us. I'll leave you the car. - A pleasure. - Good luck. Bye. I can't go on. It's stronger than me. I don't know what's pushing me away. The burning kiss? The tears? His sense of duty? Of honor? The taboo of a mother's love? Or does he really despise me? Yes. He despises me. He calls me a crying hyena in the corner of a city zoo. Petr. Are you leaving? Yeah. I have to look after my son. You have a son? Eight months. - So tiny! - Yeah. Can I ask you something about the play? Sure. In the original, Phaedra tries to seduce Hippolytus, but he rejects her. So, as revenge, she tells Theseus that Hippolytus tried to rape her. Theseus punishes his son, but Phaedra feels so guilty that she kills herself. In your version, her revenge is different. Instead of the lie about the rape, she develops a formula that allows Theseus' rivals to make money from privatization and blames Hippolytus for sharing that formula, right? Right. So what's your question? I want to know if it's still a play about love and passion, or if it's about something else. I guess it's still the main subject. I just wanted to make it more complex. Is there anything more complex than love and passion? I guess you're right. Of course I'm right. I'm always right. Katerina? Katerina? Don't you hear him crying? Yeah, I do. I guess he's hungry or needs changing. And you don't care? If you don't care, I don't care. It was your turn today. Sorry, but I can't watch him now. - I can't watch him either. - What are we going to do then? Give him to me. I'll change his diaper. You make his milk. You told me to leave. If you'd told me to watch him, I would have. That's why I came. What about embarrassing me with Janecek? Embarrassing you? Telling him about the cafe. But we agreed you'd tell him. Well, I didn't. Now he knows. And he seemed to like it. It's good business. Why are you laughing? I have no time now, but I can prepare something for him. I won't present it to him. Why not? Because it's a bad project. If he invests in it, he'll lose his money. But it's our project. Ours, yeah? Our project, our idea, Katerina. Then let me work on my project. Because what you call "our" project is really your project. I also have my own project. Similar, but better. What project? What project? What other project? Monologue. You offered him Monologue to invest in? It has a better business plan, better capitalization, and it's in the center. It's a fucking cafe full of hipsters! You go there yourself. Janecek liked it. That's why you met him there? Right? What a betrayal. Yeah? Because it's my work and I want to do well? I don't do my job well? I'm saying that when this theater dream is over, we'll need something to live on. Fuck you! Theater dream! Now you yell at me like a real man. And you cry like a hyena in a corner of the zoo. What? If you'd read my play, you'd know what I'm talking about. Yeah. I'm clearly missing out. Don't try to change the subject, Phaedra. You're talking about your stepson. About your husband. You're right. You can't understand how I feel. You don't know how it feels to want someone else's unhappiness. The guilt and anger I have inside. How I wish I could hold him in my arms. Are you crazy? Petr. Hi. So glad I ran into you. I forgot my charger in the theater. - Can't you get it tomorrow? - No. How will I browse Tinder? - That's true. - Yes. Thanks. - Did you walk from the hotel? - Yeah. I tried to get a charger there. Is she on maternity leave? Yes, she is. She was working as financial consultant for a bank, but resigned when we moved here. Is she going back to work? She's trying to work from home, pitching ideas to some investors. But it's difficult from a town like Kladno. I can imagine. Are you thinking about going back? To Brno? - Careful. - Thank you, Mr. Capek. I don't want to go back. After three years running the theater, I'm finally trying new things. That's good. I'm happy for you. Thanks. So tell me. How do you like the play? I like it. Thanks. I'm still lost with the formulas, but I like it a lot. - Really? - Yeah. It's not here. Nor here. What is it? iPhone? Android. I may have a charger in my office. It's OK. I'll ask the hotel to wake me up. What about Tinder? At least I'll avoid the weirdos. - I bet there's a lot of them. - Millions. They all want to see my photo with today's paper, to prove it's me, like a hostage. Maybe they think you're some guy in Indonesia. Nobody speaks Czech in Indonesia. Maybe a refugee from Vietnam. - And what about music? - I'm not sure. I have Brahms, Mozart. Recordings of the National Orchestra. We can't afford more. Like a good salary. You get the honor of performing in Kladno. And the luxury accommodation for guest actors. Exactly. Just wait here a sec. I have something for you. What? Don't worry, I'm not like Honza. You know about that. Down to the last detail. Don't worry. You're safe with me. So close your eyes, and count to twenty. Better to sixty. Hey! You're looking. Sixty! What is it? Just a silly thing. I had one and my brother too. I guess every baby had one. For Alex? Thanks. It's nothing, really. It cost, like, 49 koruna. - So I owe you a drink. - OK. - Good night, then. - Good night. Speak. Take this letter. It's a last confession of my crime. The whole truth. When I die, when I close these eyes and lips that carry his last kiss, take this letter to Theseus, his father. Will you do it? - Yes. - Do you swear? - I swear, but... - I want to stay pure in his eyes. Only truth purifies. I'm a bit disappointed in myself as a father. Really? You don't seem so. Seem disappointed? Or a bad dad? You don't seem a bad dad. You look disappointed all the time. I don't think I'm a bad parent. Just not the one I imagined. Nobody is just good or just bad. Like Lady Gangsta said, "I can appreciate where your uncertainty stems from, but this attitude will just hold you back in this life." Thank you for your gangsta advice. You're welcome. Good night. OK, thanks. Goodnight. Room 305. ACT III THE REHEARSALS FIVE DAYS BEFORE THE PREMIERE Did you eat? Yeah. We're finally making progress. There's some movement. Tell me about it tomorrow, OK? I'm really tired. How is he? Good. The fever's passed. Will you give him the drops in an hour? Yeah. I might have to stay here this weekend. I don't really like Karel's designs. They're not edgy enough. You could've told me before. I didn't know until now. He just showed them to me. I wanted to go with you. Why not? Because? I wouldn't be able to live my life anymore. I don't understand that. I guess I don't want to waste so much time and energy with anyone. A relationship's always quite limiting. It's not always limiting. No? - It also gives you something. - Yeah? Like what? You share things. There's two of you. Or three when you have a child. I don't want to be a mother. Ever. You say that now. You're an actress. I'm not trying to convince you, Petr. Nowadays we don't talk much, Katerina and I. We used to. And I enjoyed coming home. I'd tell her what I'd been up to, share my problems. Sure. It's like having two lives. Because you're sharing everything, like the other person's life is yours. So now my life is yours. I didn't say that. We have to get dressed. Are you mad? Why? We'll be together the whole weekend. Petr, I'm not kidding. I don't want you to stay. I made plans already. - Plans? - Yeah. Are you serious? Yep. You're lying. You don't have plans. Yes, I do. What plans? Plans. Tell me about your plans. You can't do this, you know. Just say you're staying. It doesn't work like that. - How does it work? - I don't know, but not like that. Like what? Having to plan everything. What to do, how to do it, when to do it. Get it? It's wearing me out. - I can do it as much you want. - Just leave me alone! What's wrong? Are you going to answer that? Share with your wife what you did today. I don't understand what happened. A minute ago you were so happy. I wasn't happy, I was horny. Try to learn the difference. Don't be hysterical. Now you call me hysterical. Karolina. Go back to your wife, please. It was Pavel. Is he still here? Did you offer him something? That cat's a lost cause. And so are you. The refusal for your request for extra funding. Besides, we found some discrepancies in your budget, so we'll audit your management. You have 15 days to send your comments. Details are in the report. Are you trying to bury me? No, not at all. We're being fair. Good luck with the premiere. Next Wednesday, right? After the holiday. I asked Pavel for a few tickets for some friends. They're not theater lovers. They're rather loud. Hockey fans. And good luck with the cat. You can have it for a while, but in the end it will go back to whom it belongs. What a bastard. He always was. - Can we do anything? - Not much. Why did he do this? He wants you to change the play. So his friends don't get mad. He did it in the past. Did it work? Sadly, yes. Phaedra was right. Her body's still warm and she's already forgotten. Nobody will remember her. Her passion. Her blindness. Her suffering. That was always her destiny. Oblivion. Her destiny. Finally. How long? One hour, 32 minutes. It's good. But we're still a bit slow in the second act. We need it a little faster. Let's repeat the scene with Rosa. Karolina? She wasn't well. She went back to the hotel. - The hotel? - Yeah. She left two scenes ago, right? - What are you doing here? - Can I come in? I'm going back to my shower. Where were you? - I already did my part. - You didn't wait for my notes. You think they'll improve the play? What's done is done, what's not is not. After today there's only the dress rehearsal. I thought you liked the play. Petr, I want it over. Understand? What are you talking about? I mean you and me. I want it to be over. If you contact me outside the theater, I'll leave. - You can't just leave. - Of course I can. There'd be consequences. Are you threatening me? I don't need to threaten you, If you leave, people will talk. Then I'll tell them all about us. What do you mean? This has nothing to do with us. - Why are laughing? It's true. - Jeez, you're unbelievable. A lot of people have worked on this. So now you care about other people? You're holding them hostage. People you know. I'm not holding them hostage. This is between you and me. First you were mad because I was visiting Katerina's parents. Now I stay and it's worse. Everything I do is wrong. Yeah, it's true. Your wife's wrong, your lover's wrong, your play's wrong. Everything in your life is shit. - I'm not going to let you insult me. - Get out, please. Where are you going? None of your business. - Where the fuck...? - Don't touch me! You'll go on on Wednesday. Contact me one more time and I won't come back. - Get out. - Fuck, I don't? - Don't touch me. Fuck! - I can't believe this is you. Believe what you want. - You're a different person. - Go to hell, Petr. I saw your text. I called you back, but you didn't answer. I called the theater. We were backstage, on the scaffolding. We finally solved the staging problem. Now I can go with you. I don't want you to come. I don't need to stay here. I wanted to finish it. That's why I was late. I'm serious, Petr. I don't want you to come. I've had enough these past few weeks. Don't make it worse. Make it worse? We'll stay at my parents until next week. What? I think it's best if we have some time apart. What are you talking about? You'll have time for your play, for the premiere. What are you talking about? What are you talking about? When I come back, I want you to move out. I'm looking for a place in Prague. My parents will help me. Are you crazy? Let's talk tomorrow. I'm really tired. No, explain it to me. I have to drive tomorrow and I need to rest. I want to lay down. Katerina, you can't do this to me. I went to Karolina's hotel. I needed to talk to her. She threatened to leave the play. Leave me alone, OK? For fuck's sake! You're throwing me out and I can't even ask why? Please leave. I don't want you here. I'm afraid. Of what? I hate when you behave like this. And how the fuck?? You're taking my son away! How the fuck should I react? You're not going anywhere. You're not going anywhere. I'll come back tomorrow and we'll talk. Is that clear? Excuse me. What time is it? What are you doing here? Did I oversleep? You still have half an hour. I'll be right there. You want coffee? Yeah. She's not answering me either. Petr, what's going on? Karolina, please open up. Karolina. What's going on here? Go fuck yourselves. How dare you. Let's go inside, my love. Listen up. Marketa, Sacha, Martina, come with me. Karolina will not go on tonight, so the main role will be played by Marketa. What? ACT IV PREMIERE You came. And with Alex. I couldn't find a babysitter. And Janecek wanted to see your play. Janecek? Yeah, he's parking. He wanted to see the theater. I think it's too late for business. - I've been calling you for days. - I didn't want to talk to you. And now you do? We came to see the play. And I need you to take Alex afterward. Maybe you don't remember, but you threw me out. I'm sleeping at my office. But you can go home. I'm going to Prague with Janecek to sign some contracts. So you closed some deals? Yes, some. You're good. Thanks. I see you changed actresses. Yeah. Marketa was best for the role anyway. I don't want to talk about it. Yeah. This is Andrea. She'll be the stage manager. - Thanks. - You're welcome. The second rehearsal was 1 hour, 47 minutes. Break a leg. Please. House lights in three... two... one... Now. Play the recording. Stage lights. Girls. Positions. - Touch me for good luck. - Go, go. Curtain up in three... two... one... Now. I wish for this winter to never end. For snow to cut the roads. For an avalanche to fall on the roof. For the whole world to disappear. For Hippolytus to become again the child who spied on me while I dressed. For him to mess up the closets searching for coins. For him not to know the taste of beer, or cigarettes in girls' mouths. INTERLUDE - THE SUN DOESN'T ALWAYS SET INTO THE SEA Phaedra was right. Her body's still warm and she's already forgotten. Nobody will remember her. Her passion, her blindness, her suffering. That was always her destiny. Oblivion. Her destiny. You were great. - You were great. - No, please. Come onstage, please. It can always be worse, right? How did it go? Terribly. How is he? He was really good. I'm really glad you didn't give in, and didn't rewrite the play. - I had no other option. - Of course you did. And that's why I respect you. In spite of everything. - In spite of everything? - Yes, in spite of everything. People love in spite of everything, even in spite of themselves. The sun doesn't always set into the sea. You really read it? ACT V THE NEW PLAY Can I come in? What a cutie. I ran into Martina. She didn't even say hi. The play was a disaster, Karolina. A disaster. I hope you aren't back for the role. No. I came to pick up my things. This is yours. You didn't give it to him? Why? Back then there was nothing between us. - You came to talk about that? - I want to apologize. And explain why I left. - It doesn't matter now. - I couldn't be near you, you see? I couldn't do this to you. - You obviously could. - I don't mean the play. Maybe you thought I wanted you to leave Katerina. I don't know what you mean. You wanted to spend the weekend with me. I stayed and you left the play. I shouldn't have asked you to stay. I guess I was jealous. But when you said you'd stay, I got scared. You got scared. Yeah. Because something happened that I didn't expect. Jesus, don't tell me this happened because you feel something for me. Of course I feel something for you. What? You love me? Do you love me? That's why you left the play? You love me, is that it? Maybe, but not the way you think. What the fuck do I think? What do I think? You label everything. For you, love exists or it doesn't. Everything's black or white. This is such bullshit. And you should distinguish between being in love and being horny. I told you there's a difference between being happy and being horny. Love and sex always go hand in hand. That's the problem. Great. I'll write my next play about it. It could have been much worse if I stayed, Petr. - It would have been? - Get the fuck out. Don't scream, for fuck's sake! Sorry, my sweetie pie. Sorry. Look. We're going home. Look there. A light. Here it is. Look there, the lights. Look. Do you see? There's Kladno, everywhere. It's all good. We're going home. Where were you? I was worried. I've been calling you since 2am. How's Alex? He's alright. You've been drinking? Yeah, we had a drink with Adam. So now you call him Adam. I can call him as I please. Did you have a good time with Adam? Yeah, we had a good time. He offered me a job in Brno. In Brno? He wants me to manage his real estate business. What about me? What about us three? You can stay here. And by the way, he liked the theater a lot. He liked the idea of the cafe. When he's back next month you can put the project to him. So you took his offer? Look, I'm going to sleep. I'm really tired. - Sleep in Alex's room... - What did you do? Can we talk about this tomorrow? Or you know what? It'll be best if we don't talk about it ever. Not tomorrow. Not ever. I don't know if I want to stay in this town, to be with you, or if I want to leave you. Can you let me talk and listen for a change? You want to divorce me. Right? I don't know. I don't know if I want the life we had. Or thought we had. I just know it'll be really tough to forget what happened these past few months. So when I say I don't want to talk about it, I mean it. It's your turn to change him. EPILOGUE
