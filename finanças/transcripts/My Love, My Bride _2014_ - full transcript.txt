Presented by Cineguru Daou Technology Inc. A Film Momentum production Executive produced by KIM Young-hoon Produced by BYUN Bong-hyun I think... - What the... - You have a new message. I'm getting married. Don't do that, dude! Why? You did it twice! Objection based on experiences. Live alone, buddy. How could you get married before me? With whom anyway? Of course, with Mi-young. Why so suddenly? Is she pregnant? Crazy bastards. No way. It's just about time. And it makes me a jerk not to propose after 4 years that we've been together. I'm serious. Don't do that! Go for it... being alone is lonely. You're still lonely when married. Just go home, stupid! I'm serious. I'm in front of her place. Shall I end it? He wants to break up with you? He suddenly came to see me. Even worse, I got puffy eyes. What does he want? I don't know. He's been acting weird lately. He must be out of his mind! Oh, my! I look like a pig! What is it? Speak up quickly. I've been thinking lately... We've been arguing often... We've been dating already for 4 years. Time sure flies. - So what? - What? Cut the chase, and get to the point. I left the washing machine on. Sure... washing machine. And I got the job a while ago... although it doesn't make much money working as a civil servant. What's the point? What I mean is... It's been 4 years already... And you don't know a thing after all these years. My darling is ill! Your eyes are swollen. Why didn't you tell me that you're sick? Oh heck! Don't mind me. Just say it! Shit... No, not now. We're not in the right mood. Let me pick another day. What mood? Just say it. No, I'll do it later. Are you seeing someone else? What? That's why you get bored of me? What are you talking about? No way, impossible! Then why bother me asking to come out for nothing? Bother you? Why did you come if it bothers you that much? If you just said so, it could've saved much trouble for me. Then you had left quietly? Or what? You're saying I would've created a scene? - Why are you so upset? - Me? Upset? You make me want to leave now. Go home! No one's holding you! I got it. Let's break up! Let me save your trouble! Damn it! MY LOVE MY BRIDE My sweet Mi-young, I will make you happy. We'll live happily ever after. Don't worry, Mi-young. I will make you happy. I believe in you, Young-min. HOUSEWARMING Try to focus at work although you'll miss me lots. Mon cherie! You forgot your bag! Right, my bag... I can't help it! This is the arm bar technique. Need to cook your dinner... No bright card, no animal card and I went for GO 3 times. Make a choice. One big hit or several small ones? A big one! All right, better be prepared for a really big shot! It's a double! What? Are you hurt? It's gone. - Let's go to work. - I remember today's Sunday. Not working for me. Go to work! I'll go shopping with mom later. She asked me to pick a coat. I'll have eel rice for lunch. Lots and lots of eels! For my stamina! - Stamina! - Great lord! Save it to yourselves. You're torturing a lonely woman. - Good morning. - Good morning. You were so hot all through the night. I am quite sensitive to the sound. The place is well soundproofed, but still I could hear you. Sorry we watched the ball game last night. I don't blame for being passionately in love. But please be considerate of my babies... We only watched the ball game on TV. Ball game only last night. Ball game it is, then. Go ahead. - Mi-young! - Yes? Sure. Damn ball game. I want to watch the ball game, too. With someone very loudly! We hate it when someone smiles at his mobile for no reason. I was searching for something. I let you off the hook as you got just married. But now you reached the limit. No more than 3 months. I got it. Take a tour with your questionnaire at the community welfare centre. Yes, ma'am! By the way... What? About the personnel reinforcement... Says a person who stares at his mobile all day? I love your shamelessness. GOT THE SPECIAL BEDDING. HURRY HOME! - Mr. KIM Young-min! - I didn't look at the phone. Can I file the moving-in report here? Are you... Seung-hee? I heard you were in New York. After living abroad for a long time, I felt like living in a traditional house. I also heard you earn the huge royalty! Stop it, it's embarrassing. Don't be embarrassed. You like poetry and music. Lyricist is the perfect fit for you. You liked them both. Do you still write poems? You always said that you'd be a poet. Now I'm embarrassed. Why? I liked your poems. Can still quote a few verses. Really? No reason to lie. This is where you live. Hey. Any plan for tonight? It's Friday night. Tonight? - Right, you're a married man. - Should be home early, I guess. No, not at all. We are quite independent. Respecting each other's privacy. Good. Let's have a get-together in a while! Shall we...? Why don't you pick up the phone? You might lose your job hanging onto your phone like that. - What's this? - It's for her boyfriend. Don't you realize you've got less than a month till the exam? You're not aiming for art high? I'm thinking of going to regular high to focus on study. Then don't waste your time here. Go to prep school instead. And stop torturing me. I'll have it in temporary custody. And you're not done till you finish the apple. It's not finished yet! Shit... you're not even a real teacher. Right, so I have nothing to lose. You have to draw this, too. Don't bluff... she won't let you! Isn't it too late? Sure we can! Let me call her first. So Jung-jin's married for two years. Ki-tae's been married twice. And Dal-soo you are... He's done my share. So I'm still single. - One and only here. - Right. You're single. And I'm a returned single. What a diversity we have. I envy you the most. Don't ever get married. Why do you keep saying it to me? You're not the only one. I'm saying it to everyone. To save them from hell. But Young-min doesn't seem to be in hell. He must do lots of good stuffs, right? - Good stuffs? - You know. - You are a hopeless bastard. - People never change. What's taking him so long? Gone for cooking or what? Housewarming? How can I prepare it at this hour? Didn't you tell me to wait in leopard lingerie? I'm so sorry. I love you, Mi-young. But please do this for me. You should do this! They claim that I am under a wife's thumb like them. But you know that I'm not. You're not an awful tyrant. Couldn't let them denounce you. I need to show them our happy marriage! What happy marriage? I didn't wait for all day for this! Just order some Chinese... And pigs' feet maybe... Also some beer? No forget it. I'll buy the beer. It's too heavy for you. Whatever! Sorry, honey. I love you so much, Mi-young! Why is it taking you so long? - Okonomiyaki? - What? - You really don't have to... - What's this nonsense? Got it, as it's your specialty. We'll be right there! - What okonomiyaki? - See you! - Hello? Young-min! - Okonomiyaki sounds good. She's a great cook. - So? Can we or can't we? - Of course, we can! Let's hurry! Okonomiyaki tastes best at the bar... The bar inspires your writing... - Waiting for hubby? - Good evening. Watching a ball game again? When does the season end? No, he's suddenly bringing the guests, so I ordered some food. The delivery guys must be lost. Your hubby got some guts to bring people home at this hour. That's what I mean. But would the delivery do enough? Your husband might lose face even if it's a short notice visit. You never get old, Seung-hee! The flowers get faded in front of your beauty. They all withered. - Cut the crap! - I got them as those were so pretty. - Do you like the color? - Yes, perfect. - Good. - You have a taste. You mean it? Hon... you've been waiting for us? Oh, you're here already. How do you do? - Good evening. - It's been a while. It's for you. Sorry I missed your wedding. This is Seung-hee, a famous lyricist. Remember? I told you about her a lot. Sure, you did. Except the part... that she's a woman. Did he say that I'm a man? No, I must've misunderstood as he called you bro. - She used to be! - Stop it! Yes, we are like real brothers. Known each other forever. Except I've got no balls. - Hello, ma'am. - Hello. - This is our landlady. - Hello, ma'am. - And these are my... - I know... bros. You are a brother from now on! - We'll behave. Excuse us. - Go ahead. Heard you prepared a feast for us? You really didn't have to...Young-min always brag about your cooking. - Our expectations are real high. - Yes, thanks. Shall we go in? Please go ahead. I have to make a call. - Right, let's get in! - No, no. - Yes, yes! - Let's wait for her. Let's move fast! Move, move! - Is this 372-1? - Right. Smoked and spicy pigs' feet, one each, right? Right. Delivery! Spicy chicken and sweet and sour pork. Is it a right order? Yeah... Bring them to the 2nd floor. It's an endless feast! Didn't they have dinner? Like they had starved for weeks! So annoying. Don't do that! You stay still. I said don't! Is he a nut or what? It's my wedding photo! My sweet and sour endorphin, give me your love. Everybody scream! It's my turn to sing. - What? - Your bombs are so good! - Want a slow jam or a fast track? - You're such a bomb mixer. Why do you guys do this me? It sounds like cursing. Creepy! You even sing well! Thank you, Mi-young. Love you, Mi-young. Leave me alone. Kill me, Mi-young. - They will be here all night? - No way, they should go. Their wives are tyrants unlike my sweet Mi-young. You're all mouth. Seung-hee said your okonomiyaki is so good. Better than the famous one she had in New York. She compared it to Japanese food in New York? Please join us, Mi-young. - You must be tired. - She's okay. I'm okay, please have fun. The food is really good! Yes, especially the pigs' feet are great! What? Better than the ones in my neighborhood! Mi-young! Why don't you sing for us? We're not at the talent show. Why sing in front of the people? We all did! What does it make us then? It's not what she meant. She really hates singing. Not to mention in public. And she's a terrible singer. It's not polite to force her to do what she's bad at. - Sorry, we're a bit wicked. - We're wicked. - You don't have to do it. - Yes. I will sing. Not a big deal. Way to go, Mi-young! One, two, we're testing. She's so lovely! How do you take it if I come closer to you? I can't be brave enough. But if you're leaving me, you're out of my world, I won't even know how to say good-bye. I'm such a fool to just... just look at you. But I'm too afraid we won't be even friends if I tell you how I feel about you. She asked us to stay, how come we're leaving! - It might upset her feelings. - Sure, come in. Stay. Here we go! We should stay. It won't upset her, not a bit! - How are you so sure? - I am sure! You sure you'll be okay? No problem. She does whatever pleases me. Call me if you're in trouble. My couch is all yours. Right. Good night. Thanks for tonight, Mi-young. I'm such a fool to be afraid already if you're leaving me... I'm such a fool... not to tell you how I feel. It may be that I... LOVE YOU, MI-YOUNG NAGGING Hello, is this Ms. PARK Gye-ja? This is Samcheong-dong community service center. Community service center. Community... Well, calling from a town office. Right. I'm calling you to inform you're now qualified to be a basic livehood beneficiary... Basic livehood beneficiary. Let me put it this way... do you have children? Son or daughter. Do you have one? Good! No no no, not doughnut! Your daughter! d-a-u-g-h-t-e-r, daughter. No, we're not giving you doughnut! Actually, we are giving you other things... after I check several things with your daughter. On the phone... No, I'm not saying she's on the run. Ma'am... let's do this. Let me call you later. No. I said I will call again. Yes, bye for now. No one's stopping you here. Please let us work, we're busy. Quiet or I give you hard time! You're full of crap! Doing work? Neh! Ta-da! Oh, here comes dear Chief KIM. We're serving the country here. Please go home first and take some rest. What's this? It's for the taxi. No kidding. It's not even close. Here's 10 bucks. Now we are talking. Make him an example, you slopps! I love you, Chief KIM. - Likewise. - See you soon. The one who gave me butterflies, the one who gets me nervous Mi-young, coffee please! Young-min! I asked you million times already to pee with the toilet lid up. Oh, Sorry. Old habit... You never wrote me a letter. Now you get poetic sentiments? Don't wear sweat pants when you're going out! Didn't I tell you to throw away this worn out shirt? What'd people think of me letting you wear this garbage? You know what the landlady told me yesterday? You just killed my ideas! Told you hundred times to tidy up once you're done! Am I married or parenting? - Don't be too late. - Why am I always the one to nag? - What? - Can you do it before I tell you? - You're stubborn like a kid. - Isn't this bothering you? Not at all. Should we call it off? Yeah, let's stop. Don't. Let's sleep. - Please don't, I'm tired. - I am, too. But we have to overcome difficult times by uniting our bodies... I'm not really in the mood. Go to sleep. Why did you take off my clothes if you're not up to it? I didn't take them off. You did it yourself. Put the pants back on! I'll be the one who suffer if you catches a cold. Ms. OH? Oh my! What are you doing here? Been to a friend's wedding and felt like a movie. This is my husband. This is Jun-soo working at the same art institute. He was my junior at college. I told you about him. Did you? I don't recall though... You're on a date? Newlyweds... What you see is not what you get. I begged him to come. - He might believe you! - Why not? It is true. What time is your show? I'd never been married if I knew I would meet you, Che GUEVARA. I thought he was your father. How tall is he? 5. 7 ft. he said, but I never buy it. He looks much smaller 'cause of the bad proportion. What is this smell? Did you take the subway? You smell like subway. I had no other option. I came in my BMW. Could only dream about it. He's a minor civil servant. Not so smart for a guy who has such a big head. How is he at night? Simply rubbish! - Can I help you, sir? - What? There are customers who have troubles with this. - Look. - Yes? - I am good. - Excuse me? I am good at it! How about you? Seeing anyone? - Kind of... I'm dating Jin. - Really? - Great! - Don't tell anyone. Promise. - Sure... your secret's safe with me. - Hush, hush. You got them? What took you so long? My head is big but my brain is not. Pleasure meeting you. Take a good care of her. None of your business. He's joking, sorry. You're too tall. Definitely blocking the sight of the person behind you. Sorry, my legs are longer than they seem. I'm so sorry. We'll have crab meat soup, pork and chicken. Just two black noodles, please. Two black noodles. You said I can have anything I want! - Do you know Che GUEVARA? - Che GUEVARA? - Do you know where he's from? - He's a Cuban. So ignorant! - Where is he from then? - Won't tell you. - What? - Google him. Internet is not just for online shopping. - What's wrong with you today? - What? - Did I do something wrong? - Nope. What was it then earlier? In the cinema, I was abashed. - So embarrassed. - Did I embarrass you? Sure, you did. Why laughed to the kiss scene? What's wrong with laughing? Should I cry to see a couple making out? Hell... She doesn't realize at all what she did wrong. She flirted with a stranger in front of her husband. And keeps a secret with him? Hush, hush? Look at her eating like a pig. It kills my appetite. Is it delicious? Is it that good? Damn! What are you doing? Pardon? What the heck is wrong with you? Damn it's hot! He just went out without eating. Is it a hunger protest or what? Where did he go? Don't care. Should be drinking with bros. With that young kid! In my presence! - Did they make out? - They talked, just a talk! - Talk is good. - You never know what they talk about. He's such a miser to my family. When we visit his parents, he prepares 300 bucks in cash. But for my folks, he brings a 100 bucks gift certificate! And always looks for freebies from my parents. She hates me writing poems, what's worse is... she refuses doing it! You still have the Kleenex left, we gave you at housewarming? It's already gone. Then your sweet days are officially over. It's how it works in marriage. His side takes, your side gives. That's how we become to hate everything related to hubbies. Yes, I totally agree with you. Most of all, I hate his hobby best! Damn poetry! I mastered the skill to switch my wife with a hot actress. At nights, with my imagination. Ain't I great? Can you get it? I'm not like you! Kyung-mi's husband got a stomach cancer. Stage 3. What? How come? He's still young. It's all because of stress. So, don't push your hubby too much. I heard the second most stressful job is a social welfare worker. Really? Hey, my girl wants me. I should go. Right, bye. What is he doing in this weather? It pours. You shouldn't be out at this hour. The world is too dangerous for a beautiful girl like you. Bah... Cover up your neck, it's chilly. What would I feel if you walked out on me like that? - I am sorry, I'm the bad thing. - No. You're a good thing. You didn't have to repeat 'thing'. You must be hungry. I only had three fish cakes. Fish cakes? I told you to eat properly. - Should I make some noodle? - Like that. Oh, I googled Che GUEVARA. - Did you? - Yes, he's from Argentina. My girl is way too smart! Don't treat me like a baby. You're not a baby. No baby can be this hot. Do you know you're a lucky guy? I'm so lucky... lucky me! POSSESSED BY AN OBSCENE DEMON What's wrong with me? I'm still a newlywed. Is it already ennui stage? Nonsense! I'm still in love with my wife! Then why the urge of doing other women hits me like crazy? Look those legs... Why am I like this? I'm like a rutting mutt. No taste or whatever... I liked pure and innocent girls! I sure did. Wake up, Young-min. - Chief. - What? I didn't look at... I was making a copy... Pardon? I tried to call all the seniors living alone listed here. Two of them never answered. Why do I want to impress this plain young kid? Ji-hye. Do you know where Che GUEVARA's from? - Chegueva? - Yes, what? What's that? Is it like guava? Why the hell do I want to impress an ignorant girl like her? They're not answering? Mr. PAN Mok-won, 78 and Ms. LEE Young-lim, 83. I called them 3 times for 2 days but they never answered. Let's call a few times more and if they don't answer, - I will have to visit the domicile. - All right. What a jerk... these seniors might be dying! But all you care is the breasts of this ignorant kid. You're a bastard, an animal! This is Viagra salve by Dr. JONES! It's an exclusive gift for you. From your best friend. Viagra? How much do we take one time? You son of a bitch! Spit it out! It can kill you! I said it's a salve! You ignorant bastard! - It looks mayonnaise to you? - Ah, salve... I get it. - I'm sorry, dude. - Give me that! This is a good stuff. Let me try it on you. Even though I doubt you need it. I don't need this. I would rather need an anti Viagra thing. Why is that? I get to want to do it with any girl at first sight. You finally got stranger alert! How do all the married men deal with this? - Are you like that? - Kidding? I am so like that. And you're okay with it? I feel like I'm being an animal. Hate myself. It's very natural and human. Stop rubbing! - It can kill you. - No way! - Hello. - Honey, I'm at mom's. Again? - What? - She's sleeping at her mom's. So you're off duty tonight? Dudes, I'm really restless. How about the 2nd round at my place? Cut the bullshit! Now you got a whole night to write poems. I really feel that I shouldn't be alone tonight. Wake him up! Dal-soo! Dude! Wake up! - Shit! - Why? It hurts... so bad! It got jammed! Why? Why? Why? What are you doing? Hands off! You shouldn't do this. Please don't do this to me! Please don't. Young-min! Hey. What are you doing here? I'm off duty... No, what I meant... I just felt like walking. - You did? - Yes. Do you know why I quitted writing poems? No, I don't. I got too lonely. Should I move a bit closer? If she doesn't like it, I can pretend I was joking. Look at her body. So nice and slim. She even wrote quite erotic lyrics. She wouldn't take one night stand too seriously? I am still lonely. And she's saying herself that she's lonely blah-blah. Let's start with holding hands. Words can be so lively. in a simple plain sentence. Yes, they are. Look at her. She doesn't push away? And then... shall I move to the next stage? I can introduce you to some composers if you like. I had a crush on you. What? You're beautiful. What's with you? You're beautiful tonight. I'm sorry, so sorry. Give me a minute. What? Why is it so easy? Wait. Can I be this instinctive? And what about Mi-young? - You may come in. - Yes! It's not manners to say no to a girl who's so ready! Yes, show some courtesy! I used to love her once. Or I might be still in love. Quick! Damn innerwear! Let go of me! Damn winter innerwear! Let go! Oops, I am sorry! Are you okay? Sure. I love you, Mi-young. Hey you. Go off me, would you? Listen to me, Seung-hee! You scared me! Are you coming home now? What are you doing at this early morning? Leaving the wastes. At this hour? All the cats in the neighborhood seem to be horny. Can't sleep at all. Go up quick. Your wife must be worried. - Let's keep it quiet though. - Yes, ma'am. - Is the baseball season over? - Yes, yes. IT'S BETTER FOR US TO HAVE STOPPED LIKE THAT. LET'S STAY AS FRIENDS, BRO!:) SURE. GOOD NIGHT, BRO. ALL THE MESSAGES TO BE DELETED FIRST LOVE - Mi-young! Coming home now? - Hello. - The bill for water. - Oh... What's up lately? I'm quite swamped at work. It's an entrance exam season. You didn't raise your voice last night though. What? I expected it to be noisy as your hubby came home at dawn. He did? I went to bed early. He came in almost in the morning. I see. He must be busy at work, too. What kind of work requires drinking on duty? Look at you. You got freckles! No way! I'm still young for that. Impossible. They are surely freckles. What comes next when you already have freckles? It will go away, I must've got too much sunlight yesterday. You should take good care of yourself. Look at me. I'm old but still called beauty as I have a fair skin. Mom is a fair skin beauty. Should get going. Bye. Auntie has freckles, She needs some care. Mom is a skin beauty. Auntie is a beauty of freckles. - What're you doing? - Posting pictures on SNS. I never get to understand the people doing SNS. Why not? Why are you trying to disclose your privacy and share it with strangers? Did you drink last night? What? Yeah, briefly with the gang. You told me you ate dinner that I prepared. Yes, I had it... when I got home early after a drink with the gang. I see. You came home early. Sure. How's your poem? It goes kinda okay. Sleep tight. Yes, ma'am. She's already good at shadows and water. There's not much I could advise on those. No reason for me treating students unequally. What? Incentives? Oh, no. I don't expect those. Well, I got your point. Gotta go as I have a class now. I'm not being impolite, ma'am. Hello? Ma'am? Hello? Hello! - Director talked a lot about you. - You know him... Ms. OH, come in. This is Ms. YOO In-young who studied the arts in France. She is a curator at national gallery. I know. We went college together. - Nice to see you again. - What brought you here? She has a special lecture for your class today. Please assist her. Do you like teaching kids? Did you quit painting? Done with the painting? Well... Got it. You should make a living. Can I ask you something? Are you still in touch with Sung-woo? Who? It's so unexpected to hear that name, especially from you. We broke up right away. He wanted to get back to you. Let's not talk about the past. You can find his details on the Internet. He's staging a musical. Shall we go together? Would it be a little awkward? You can go if you like. I don't feel like it. CHOI SUNG-WOO MUSICAL DIRECTOR/ THEATRE CEO RESERVE TICKETS FIRST LOVE CHOOSE NO. OF TICKET GOING TO SEE A MUSICAL WITH EUN-JUNG Hi, it's me. Where are you? You're at in-laws'? I'm your mommy's friend. Can I talk to her? Oh, she's with daddy. The number you dialed is under the int'l roaming service. Roaming? Said she's penniless. Any style do you have in mind? Just make me look younger. Having a blind date? Nice. Are you free at 3PM today? Excuse me? No, nothing. Wait a minute. Please leave a message after the beep. What the... Why? Someone's not answering? I can't reach my wife. She must be seeing someone else. It was great, Sung-woo! Congratulations! - Do you have time to eat? - Sure. - Let me treat you a dinner. - No, let me. Thank you. I'll be right back, In-young. Mi-young! You are Mi-young, right? Hey, that's my mask! Thank god you're finally here! Why are you so late? Mi-young. Is that you, Sung-woo? What are you doing here? I'm working part time here. At this theatre? We can meet often then. I'm staging a musical here. I just quitted today. Oh... that was your musical. Why did you quit? - It wasn't my kind of stuff... - Your kind... You haven't changed a bit. Stop flattering. My husband always complains I'm changed. You're married? Is he good to you? Kind of... The first song of your musical, wasn't it the one you requested to a radio program for me? Did I? But you said you haven't seen it. No, it's just... I could hear from outside. The theatre must be old. Right... What is the look on his face? Does he know I'm lying? Or is he looking at the freckles? Should I come clean? - Your nose is bleeding. - What? Here it goes. You didn't have to do this. I remember your nose did bleed often. Even several times a day. Not anymore. It's been 10 years since last time. Right, I remember. You rushed out to buy a T-shirt saying my white blouse shouldn't get stained with blood. Did I? Don't you remember. You bought me a red one to cover the blood color. I can't recall. Maybe since it's been too long. Sure, it was long ago. I should go. Already? Hold on. This is my number. The show was great. Way to go! You didn't see it, did you? I mean... it must be great! Hi, Eun-jung. I might start painting again. In-young asked me why I don't paint anymore. You know what? I thought I was painting. I considered myself painting when I was only correcting kids' with that pencil in my hand. You can start it over. Sure... I can. But I don't know what to draw. What's wroing? Had a dispute with hubby? It became our routine. We're arguing every day. He might not like me around him anymore. I don't seem to be a big deal in his life. What's the issue? He's not buying you a red T-shirt anymore when your nose bleeds? Right... It was him who bought it. How can you forget that? He even sent a song request to the radio for you. Right. I didn't say it to you. But I was so jealous! I must be crazy. Listen. I don't know about others. But you surely are a big deal in my life. Thanks, my friend. Here it is. Thank you. So long CHOI Sung-woo. I wish you best. Looks awful. I'm home. Why ramen? I cooked you rice. Warming the stew is that difficult for you? Very kind of you. Why didn't you answer your phone? Where is the kimchi that your mom brought last time? That's why you called me? For kimchi? Because you were being late. Also mom kept calling to ask us to visit. The restaurant was too noisy so I didn't hear it. Sorry. So easy and simple. I left the memo saying I would see the musical with Eun-jung. - You drank? - Yes. Very nice and proper for women till this late. Only with her? What is wrong with you? What would you think if I pried into your privacy? No use as I always tell you everything. Good. Then where were you when I slept at my mother's? After you drank with your buddies. Don't remember. How come? It's only days before. Landlady said... you came home almost at dawn. Unbelievable. Everyone in this block is one big family! Landlady checking when the tenant comes home! Then how about you? - Huh? - What about me? You flirted with a stranger in my presence! - Hell, when? - The day... we went to movies. You mean me talking to Jun-soo? He's my colleague. How the hell should I know? I introduced him to you. And told you I taught him when he was in high school. He's just a kid. A kid is 6 ft. tall? Then you must be still a kid as your height is around 5 ft. 5.7 to be exact. Let's call things off. You're acting like a child. And don't change the subject. Something happened that day. I can feel it. How many times I told you to wash dishes when you're done! That's how other husbands do! Then you should've married with one of them! Mi-young. Open the door please. You say I smell of alcohol. - I should wash it off. - But... if you slam the door like that, what should I feel? How about my feeling? Have you ever thought of it? You don't know how much I tried to come home smiling. What's happening to us lately? It's too much for me to handle. Why are you acting like this? Me? I think it's you! What's wrong with you? You need me only when you eat and have sex. When you can't find Kimchi! That's when you need me! Am I wrong? I got it. You're bleeding. Let me see. What a temper... My bad. I'm sorry. What have you done wrong? CHOI SUNG-WOO He looks damn sly. Done with fighting? I'm sorry being too noisy. No, I've got used to it now. I wish I had someone to argue with. By the way, did anything happen? No. It's always me. You got caught having an affair! No way! Please don't say that to her even as a joke! I won't! I don't poke into other people's business. Then is it her having an affair? No! Then it's good. Good night, ma'am. You must've exhausted fighting. Sleep well holding each other tight. - Ma'am. - Yes? I believe the first love really means to women? Unforgettable... Someone says there is no one first love for women. For a woman, the first love is not the first man she loved but the first memory of the man she loves now. Just saying... Where have you been? Did I wake you up? Sorry. What happened to you today? It surely was a strange day. Your first love at the university... the guy who did the theater. CHOI Sung-woo? How did you two break up? Why do you ask now? I think you told me before but cannot recall. Maybe it can give me some ideas for a poem. The new love came... You know, I met you... Then he came back saying he wanted to turn everything back. What a fool. We were young. Then? You know the story. I was in love with you. Mi-young. Why don't we go on a picnic? To where? Anywhere. - Anywhere? - Yes. Anywhere... sounds good. I LOVE YOU, MI-YOUNG The phone was not ringing at all but I didn't suspect I had no connection. The plug is too old and broken. I was worried so much! I am sorry to make the busy one to come all the way. No way! Golden wedding means 50th anniversary, right? So impressive. But if we put aside the time raising the children and her staying sick in bed, we didn't spend much together. Are these poetry books all yours? Young generation nowadays don't care the poetry. - Do you read some? - Yes, I like them. You've got SHIM Je-hyu's collection? Isn't it the first edition? This is so hard to get! And RIMBAUD, YEATS and DICKENS... All very rare ones as they are all out of print! You can have them if you want. Do you mean it? It would be great. But these are too precious... Standing there alone I finally realized the spring has come. Grandpa... Are you Mr. PAN Mok-won? The poet? - Well... - Wow! Grandpa... no, sir! I am a huge fan of your works! Don't call me that. It's my honor for you to recognize my humble works. Oh my god. I can't believe this! Are you going to grandpa PAN's house? Sure, to get an advice for my work! I think you're a nut! What? Writing poetry thing... Can't believe it. Want to submit it to the literary contest? That's what I'm thinking but I'm not sure if I'm qualified. Your poetry is good. Really? But if the poem is too glamourous or too complicated, it is difficult for the readers to get it. I put too many tricks, didn't I? Jae-kyung was looking for you. Why? She said you hold her thing... His birthday is tomorrow! Wait. I am sure I put it here. I didn't throw it away. How can I draw it all over? Are you... crying? Do not draw my pimples. Focus on your study. That's why I am doing this. It's you who lost it! My bad, my bad. Don't be so difficult. It's been a while since I completed something! Good luck on your first love! Look! It's sea! - Do you like it? - It's been too long! Wasn't it a good idea to come here? Good job on renting a car too! Thank you, honey. I love you, Young-min! - I love you, Mi-young! - I love it! I love you, Mi-young. - The weather is great! - Ta-da! - What's this? - I got it back in the parking lot. - Isn't it pretty? - What happened to you? - Tell me it's pretty! - How much did you pay? Do you want to measure one's heart with the price? It's just I am allergic to metal. I can only wear gold or silver. Do you know anything about me? I know everything! Your sight, sizes for shirts and pants, and even cholesterol level! - I know something too. - Then tell me! Your breast is size A. - You think this is size A? - Sure. From now on, my breasts are the no-go area for your hands! It's like a death sentence to me! - I've got a call. - You've got a call? - Yes. - Honey! Hello. Yes, speaking. Really? I see. Thank you. What is it? What? I am selected for Modern Poetry New Figure Prize! Sir! Why are you outside... You dress up so nicely today! Want to take you to the nice place. Wow, it looks great! Thank you! Please pay in adavance. Oh, yes... No, it's on me. Please... Let me...! Thank you. I wanted to take you to a nice restaurant for celebration. No, I really wanted to have this! Help yourself. You cannot imagine how much I enjoyed talking to you. You helped me writing and also encouraged me a lot. I was grateful for you coming to see me. I will bother you much more from now on! My pleasure. Now you're a poet. So keep up the good work. Yes. It's true that the life is a poem and a poem is the cause of the life, but do not let the poetry take away what matters to you. Poetry exists for what's precious to you. That's what I feel now. Once my wife left me, I had thoughts... First of all, I would like to thank the jury for giving me this great prize. It's an honour. And I believe you surely have eyes for the poetry. Receiving the award, I questioned myself. The writers are the seekers to realize - Too tacky. - the essence of everything. It's not winning a Nobel Prize. Life and philosophy are... Let's wear this. My sister sent this as a gift. It's a designer's brand! - Wow! - Be careful. I will do it myself. Shall we buy this house? With what? - With your cash prize, 3 grand? - Who knows? I could be the world renowned poet. Calm down. And do not ever think of quitting your job at the town office saying you want to focus on writing. It's now called as a community service center. - My apology. - Apology accepted. Preparing the speech is tougher than writing poetry. GOETHE said... a good peom becomes a song for children, philosophy for the young, and... the life for the old. Wow, dear Mi-young! Please help me this. I am impressed! I did some research as the wife of a poet. Yes, as you can see... I live with this wonderful wife. I should enter the spring literary contest next year! Honey, how do I look? Isn't it too much? Your lips. It seems tacky as it's too much. The wife of a poet should be elegant and have some taste. I must not go. I don't feel like it actually. I know nothing about poetry and feel awkward to go. Are you upset? I just wanted to help you... I am not. It's your mother. Hello! Yes, I'm really proud of him. Yes, I will send you the picture of him as soon as the ceremony is over! - Bye. - Bye, mom! Let's go! Hurry! I'm so nervous. I don't know what it is. Water, please. Are you Ms. KIM Min-ju? No. This table is only for the award winners. - Sit at the back table. - Sure. - Congratulations. - Congratulations. How come he mistook me for that old lady... Young-min, congratulations! - Thank you. - You look great. Let us begin the Modern Literature Awards. First, let me announce the winners for the poetry. Runner-up for the poetry, KIM Young-min. KIM Young-min! Let's hear the acceptance speech. Thank you. I don't know what the poem is yet... but GOETHE once said... a good poem becomes a song for children, philosophy for the young, and for the grown-ups... no, for the old... - Life. - and the life for the old. I would try hard to write a good poem like that. Lastly, I would like to dedicate this to Poet PAN Mok-won, who inspired and helped me most. Thank you. Very nice! Go Young-min! Great. I need a hug too. MARRIAGE BY KIM YOUNG-MIN AS THE SHARP NOISE WAKES ME UP, THE DESPAIR OF BEING TWO SHEDS MY BLOOD. Why are you here? It's too stuffy inside. Wanted to get some fresh air. Right, it was a bit hot. I guess you feel bad... even if you understand it as the artistic expression... but the description of you was awful. I am totally okay. But I believe it is great to be a subject for someone. What an artist. Who do you think you are? Push off! I think you should get this. I think he got the heart attack and has been dead for a few days. Are you a social worker? Yes. Have you contacted his family? There is no one to call... PI CHEON-DEUK ESSAYS - Hey. - I'm home. How about dinner? Not yet. Do you know any doctor? My stomach's been killing me lately. Dinner's ready. Yeah. Try this. I found the recipe in the book. How is it? Not for me. How is it? I didn't put any seasoning. Just the grinded shrimps instead. Please put the seasoning! Why not? As it is not good for your health. - You don't want to eat? - No. Don't feel like eating actually. Is it that urgent? You should eat. Need to finish it by tomorrow morning. It's for the Quarterly of the city government. But you need to eat first... Honey, I have a pain in my stomach... You think I should go to see the doctor? Do you hear me? Now the idea is gone as you keep talking to me! Going out to get cigarette. Need anything? Young-min... How dare... Honey. You shouldn't have touched them if you didn't know what these are. Or at least should've told me once you moved them. I... How could you... You hate others moving your own stuffs!. You should've at least asked me or shouldn't have touched them at all! Why are you so arbitrary? It's not garbage! - How dare you! - Please, Young-min... Hello, Mi-young. - Ma... - Hello? - Please help! - Mi-young! What happened? Tell me! Oh, my, what is wrong? Are you alone? Where is your husband? Mi-young, please... Ms. OH Mi-young's guardian? - Ms. OH's guardian? - Here! It's fibroid. Fibroid? She got lots of cysts in her womb... but it's quite usual for many women. But in Ms. OH's case, she needs to get the surgery as the cyst is in the bad location. A surgery? Isn't it dangerous? No, but it would be really painful. And she cannot eat, either. Young-min. Mother. Take her to the laboratory while I am doing the registration. - I won't go with him. - What is with you? - I just don't want that. - Don't act like a child. Oh my, I left my bag at the ER. Are you okay? Feeling better? - Leave before mom returns. - How can I? Go finish your great poem. I was sensitive back then... I am sensitive too. You should've told me when you were sick. Like I didn't? Can we call this a marriage? Why do we live together? Feeling ill at ease. Feeling ill? - I want to give it a second thought. - To what? To everything. - I can't live like this. - What do you want to say? It hurts me so bad and also I feel embarrassed. So you are telling me you want a divorce or what? Why not? You... We'll talk more later. Get out of here. SURGERY IS DAY AFTER TMR SO COME BY TMR AFTER WORK. I AM ON MY DAUGHTER'S SIDE. Yes, mom. I came home just now. No, I need to do some work first... She needs underwears and lip balm... Lip what? Why needs a lip balm in the hospital? I'll bring them. It'd be difficult in the morning. I will stop by after work. Good night. Mi-young, coffee please. You must be Mr. NA Jun-o. Sorry I'm late. The traffic was so bad. Nice to meet you. No way. It's fine. I was reading a book so I wasn't bored at all. Which book? This? The collection of poems by Reiner Maria RILKE. By any chance, do you like RILKE? I'm not that easy. It takes time for me to fall for someone. I see. Sky-blue goes well with you. Is this called sky-blue? Yes, it looks good on you. Thank you. Shall we go out? Pardon? I know a nice Italian restaurant in this neighborhood. And I'm starving. Do you mind having pasta for lunch? - Well... I don't... - Let's go now. - Now? - Yes. - You mean right now? - Sure. - Going out? - Yes, this way. - What kind of pasta do you like? - Me? I like Aglio... Young-min. - Ogli... I like Aglio e Ogli... - Right. Are you holding my hand? Yes, I am quite short-tempered. Me too! You do? Please hurry. - Why do we run? - It's just... Let me carry your bag! Young-min! What is it? Are you okay? Wait for me! Damn it is hot! THE DAY HE SURPRISED ME WITH A PROPOSAL. LET'S LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER! You want to break up? Is it what you want? Then why did you say that? You should've told me not to if I said I wanted a break-up. You're over thirty and still don't know that? Then what shall you say when you really want to break up? Don't know. Since it would never happen. I just meant that I was lonley. Being lonely doesn't mean that you are alone. It's really scary that you feel lonley when you are with someone. It's true that the life is a poem and a poem is the cause of the life, but do not let the poetry take away what matters to you. Poetry exists for what's precious to you. Hi, Eun-jung. Mr. PAN was the doyen of poets who our community service center took care of. He was really kind... He even treated me the rice soup. He was... I'm sorry. Give me your hand. Gosh, it's cold. It's hot. Are you hurt? - Please bring some water! - Why is it so hot? Are you okay? - What are you doing? - I was just passing by. At this early hour? Yes... Your bed was... Someone moved out. It's better by the window. I see. - You feel better now? - Yes. I didn't know what you were going through. That's what I wanted to say. - But I said it first. - I should've... - I'm sorry. - It's okay. I am sorry. I really... Really what? I love you, Mi-young. It took you so long to say it? I'm your first love. Yes, you are. There's something I wanted to show you. What do you think? - Pretty, isn't it? - Yes, very pretty. Won't let go of your hand. I will try harder. I love you, Mi-young. I love you, too, Young-min. How long do I have to wait? Please! Hold on just a little longer. Wait a bit more, my sweetie. What should I do? Well, let me hold him. Ain't I great? Yes. Can anyone know what love is when he talks about love? How much more love do we need to define love? We kept arguing after that winter... also kept saying 'I love you.' I still don't know what love is. But I just want to say it over and over every day. I love you, Mi-young. I am... getting married... Congrat. Sorry, I'm busy. Damn, the kid is crying. Send the invitation. ...... How could you do this to me? Ki-tae left the chatting room. Jung-jin left the chatting room. Young-min left the chatting room. You look so pure today. I never felt like this since I graduated the highschool. You look more innocent being so quiet.
