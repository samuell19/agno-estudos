So you wanted to swipe my radio, you dirty scumbag! First I'll break your neck, then I'll take you to the police. I didn't see you guys. I thought someone forgot the radio. I didn't see you. I thought someone had thrown it out, or maybe lost it. How was I supposed to know? I didn't see you! But I saw you, you little thief. I'm taking you to the police. Not the police. Don't do that to me, mister. I swear I won't do it again. I'm a starving orphan. Miss, tell him to let me go. Tell him to let me go. You can't do this to me. I'm just a kid! You can't ruin me!

What do they think? That I was born yesterday? Nino! Sindaco! Show yourselves! Those rotten-- Blugippe! Succhia! Where'd he come from? Those dirty bastards! It was three against one, damn them! The three of them were partners. The oldest brother, the priest's friend, took to me right away. So did the other two. - So you found a job. - And a good one at that. A really busy place, open even at night. How'd you end up in the Parco Paolino coming from the Viale Marconi? I walked all the way. I didn't have money for the bus. I crossed a bridge and came to the park. Tell me everything you saw there: Who was there, what they were doing, and what you did. Me? Nothing. I just walked through, like everyone does. I was tired. - I didn't see much. - Be more exact. Take your time. I want every detail, no matter how insignificant. I think I saw a woman. But she was far away. I didn't really pay attention to her. I saw some guys too. Didn't you see a soldier? He had to be there. A soldier? Why a soldier? I didn't see him. I've got other things on my mind. I didn't see any soldier. Officer, I really want to work. You've got to believe me. I swear on my mother's grave. Well, Bustelli, long time no see. Just as well. One less scare for me, and one less worry for you. Why this renewed interest in my affairs? Don't you know I've quit stealing? Don't worry. We know all about it. I'm sure you don't mind seeing me after two years. I don't have a beef with anyone. I paid my debts, and now I don't owe anybody anything. Especially the police. We know you don't steal anymore. You've come up in the world. You've got a woman now. Sure, what's wrong with that? She's a good girl. Good for you. You've had a hard time of it until now. In court 17 times, and over three years in prison. Now at 30 you've settled down. That's old age for you. It gets us all in the end. This time you're in big trouble. You're implicated in the murder of a prostitute. Officer, you're barking up the wrong tree. I'll be the judge of that. What did you do yesterday afternoon? Where did you go? Who did you see? I got together with my girlfriend. We met at the race track. We have to sneak around, because her parents are against it. You must really be in love. You're always early. There's no shame in being in love. Give me a piece of candy and I'll give you a kiss. - Your new car is really nice. - You like it? Sorry I can't take you for a ride. Too much to do. I thought we were going for a ride. What do you have to do? - See Esperia? - Yes. Don't be upset. You know I'm breaking up with her. I got all dressed up. I thought we'd go someplace. Should I just go home? Don't go home. - What else can I do? - Wait an hour or so. - Where? - The newsstand at San Paolo. Here. Buy a magazine to read while you wait for me. Be good and I'll take you somewhere nice later. - Don't be long. - San Paolo in an hour and a half. Enough, you hear? I've had enough! - I'm fed up. - Give me a break. I'm tired, and it's all his fault, that leech! I slaved away my whole life so I'd have a crust of bread in my old age. You brought him here, and you can get rid of him! You don't know Donna Anita! You'd like to have it all, but the money is mine too, and I'll give it to whom I please! Is this welcome party all for me? - So you're back. - Very kind of you. You're finally here. Take your stuff and get out. Haven't you done enough? You made her sell the apartment and ate up the five million from the store, and now you've bought a new car with the money this idiot gave you! Enough! Don't worry, Donna Anita. I know it's time for me to go. - You do, do you? - I'm fed up with living here. Fed up, eh? Why don't you get out, you bastard! You know... when one pope dies, another takes his place. Where do you think you're going? Don't even think about it. Let him go! If you don't like it, you can clear out, you old hag! That's a good one! You'll die covered with lice. They'll feast on your rotten bones! You deserve it, after all you put my poor father through! I swear I'll kill you! I'm not afraid of you! I brought you into this world, and I'll take you out of it! I don't care if you are my mother! Come on if you dare! You take me for that woman you blinded with the hot coals? - They're at it again. - Always the same thing. Is there no respect anymore even between mother and daughter? Put that thing down! You think because I'm old you can walk all over me! All you think about is squeezing money out of people, sucking 'em dry! I don't want to end up like you! Money-grubber! That bastard ruined you and dragged us all down in the mud! We gave you everything. We fed you. You lived like a lord! Money, nice clothes! Come here! Come see what this filthy beggar's got in here! Look here! Look at the clothes he bought with the sweat of our brow! With our blood! I should burn them! Get out! You're through living like a lord! Get out and go back to your old rags! You should thank God for holding me back. Two more words and I'd have killed her. Let's go see Maria first. She still owes me for two weeks. I'll show her if she doesn't pay up. Then we'll go to Soraya's. She owes us her usual fee. And Clara still owes us 30,000. We've got to hurry. I've got things to do. I don't care! You're staying right here with me. What, are you keeping tabs on me? I've got friends to see. Do your friends feed you? Forget it. You'll do as I say. Esperia, you want me to kill you? My mother and father and little brother are inside. Please, don't let them know I work the streets. We don't care. Just pay up, and make it quick. - Can't you come tomorrow? - Don't start that again. Come on, get the money. We're in a hurry. - Okay, but just keep quiet. - Fine. Please, make yourselves at home. Bastard! Here, Esperia. Now I'm only two weeks behind. From the factory to the consumer. Fresh from the seller. Here, take this. Damn your old mother, the hag! Soraya! Califfo, get over here! Califfo, I'm so glad you bought yourself that car. I want everyone to envy you. Who is it? It's Esperia. Open up. Go away. I don't have a penny. Soraya, don't be such a baby. Come on, open up. I said leave. I don't have a penny. I'm sleeping. You want me to break the door down? Open up! I said I don't have it. Can't you get it through your head? There's no use yelling. I'll show you yelling! I'll break this door down! Open up! I told you, I don't have any money. What's the point of yelling like that? Afraid this useless ninny won't make it one day without his allowance? You tired of living or what? This useless ninny is my business, you hear? Now you can put your money in the ninny's hand. All of it, down to the last penny! I swear on my mother's grave! I don't even have money to put food on the table. You've got to believe me! I'm used to your whining, and I'm not falling for it. Take something else. Want my radio? My blankets? Take something? This house if full of junk! What could you possibly give me? The fleas are eating you alive! Take the radio. It works. - What's this little orphan's name? - Angelo. No, not the dog! Leave him out of this! What would you do with the poor creature? He was born right here. When you pay up, you'll get him back. Don't worry-- we won't eat him. Hurry up and get us our money. Let's go, Esperia. The sooner you give us our money, the sooner you get the dog back. You happy now? Now you belong to a gentleman. Esperia, save me some time and go on home. Home to that witch? Come on. You can take care of your business some other time. What? Stop wasting my time. I've got lots to do. Go on home. What? Do you think I pay you for your good looks? You'll take me where I say and do as I say, or else! Listen, I do as I please. If you don't like it, find yourself another slave. Either you take me where I want to go, or you can forget where I live, and this time it's for good! I'm not going back there! Don't worry-- you won't see me again! Fine! You're not worth it anyway! Then we're agreed-- I won't wait around for you! See you around! What are you doing, you bastard? We have nothing more to discuss. We're through. Nothing more to discuss? I'll make you throw up all the sweets you ate at my expense, you rotten-- Okay. You took your girlfriend home, then walked back through the park. It's like I told you. I saw some people, but I wasn't paying attention. There was a woman in the distance, and some guys. But I don't remember them. I wouldn't recognize them. So you didn't do or see or hear anything. Not a thing. All I did yesterday was take a nice, long walk. Damn her! Now what am I gonna do? Relax. Have a seat. Are you going to sit down? - Okay, Officer. - What's your name? - Cosentino, Teodoro. - Parents? Giuseppe and Beppina Gigliotti. Feroleto Antico, province of Catanzaro. September 15, 1940. What regiment are you in at Cecchignola? Thirteenth artillery, fourth company. Were you in the Parco Paolino last night? Me? No, Officer. What do you mean, no? Three or four people saw you there. Okay, I was there, but I was just passing through. That's what I asked. Try to pay attention. You can't forget anything here. Several witnesses saw you in the park. They all say you were sitting on a bench by yourself. What motive could you have for lying? I was just passing through. I hardly even remember it. Okay, then where were you before that? Where were you coming from? Rome. I had been to the movies. I was walking back, and the sun was still out. I amused myself by watching the cars and all the people getting off the streetcars. There were so many children and pretty girls. Let us praise the God of Abraham You created the mighty among the moon and stars Strong men And beautiful women Let us praise the God of Abraham Hey, come on over here! When I got to the park it was already dark. I was dead tired, so I rested on a bench. I understand, Cosentino. Now try to remember-- who was in the park? No one. Just me. God, I was sleepy. And when you're sleepy, what do you do? You lie down. And when you lie down, what happens? You fall asleep. Okay. Listen, Cosentino, I know exactly what happened. I know you slept on that bench for an hour and a half. When you woke up, who else was in the park? - What did you see? - I didn't see anything in the park. I ran into a man outside the park. I remember him because he was wearing clogs, and he was running. He had blond hair. He had something under his jacket. Some kind of package. What a mug! What? I didn't like the way he looked. He gave me a dirty look. Could you recognize him now? Sure I could. He gave me the creeps. This is all useless information. We don't care about that. You're the one who was seen running through the Parco Paolino. There aren't many low-lifes who go around in clogs. Besides, the soldier recognized you from the lineup. So were you there or not? Sure I was. Any law against that? Now we're getting somewhere. Where were you coming from? Why were you in such a hurry? You were coming from down by the river, where that woman was killed. I don't know. I'm always roaming around. How can I remember everywhere I've been? Let me refresh your memory. You were running, and you had something hidden under your jacket. Some kind of package. What was it? A present for my girlfriend. What kind of present? A cat. A kitten. Okay, let's say it was a cat. But where were you coming from? I can't remember. It's been a few days. You don't remember. That soldier was right. You are a strange one. Okay, let's see if you get your memory back. Think it over. You have all the time in the world. For your own sake. Now I remember clearly. I'll tell you everything. I always go wandering at night. I get off work at the club at 6:30. I have nothing to do, so I just wander around. I just walk around. The EUR building, the amusement park, the pyramid, and around Monteverde. The other night I found myself at the Parco Paolino. A kid walked by, all by himself. But he didn't hang around. He followed the path and left. In the distance I saw a man. He was hiding behind a bush. I don't know what he was doing. I didn't get a good look at him. I think it was a young man, with bleached-blond hair. I came to the edge of the park. A soldier was asleep on a park bench, all alone. There was another man further along, minding his own business. Then I saw two kids I know. Sometimes they come to play pinball at the club where I work. Yeah, I saw them. I know their faces well. They were talking. I think that man was waiting for them. The two boys started talking to him. Then the three of them left together. They walked by the woman. What do you want from me? I don't know anything about her! I saw those three hanging around her. She must have gone with them. You have to believe me! So you got a good look at them. You'd be able to recognize them. Sure, they're regulars at the club. And I know where they live. Where? Via Portuense, in the new developments. What are their names? The light-haired one is Francolicchio, and the dark-haired one is Pipito. How can you say we did it? Yes, we saw that woman, but we didn't talk to her. We didn't even get a good look at her. I wouldn't lie, if I were you. How can you say you didn't go near her? We didn't. You and your friend were seen hanging around that woman. What woman? What were you doing? Francolicchio and I had to scrape together 2,000 lire. - What for? - We needed it for a meal. You're confusing me. What's this about a meal? Start over. I have to understand. Francolicchio and I meet up with two girls every day at 4:00 at Villa Sciarra. They work nearby. When they get off, they have a bite at Villa Sciarra. What? Don't you know she who eats alone chokes on her food? You look really hungry. I bet you didn't even say grace first. So what? I'll say it for them. We brought something for you too, since you're always starving. Who, us? Here's some jam. And a roll for each of you. Hand over the jam. - Put some jam on mine. - Go on, spread it on. You're making a real mess! It won't come off. You're such good girls. Even my mother isn't this good to me. This jam is delicious. Another sandwich like this and I'll marry you. I'm thirsty. Wanna get a drink at the water fountain? They're so big. Will they survive? Sure, until someone decides to eat them. Milli, you like this place? A friend of mine's getting married Sunday. Lucky her! When are you getting married? Me, get married? Why? Don't you want to? Sure, but not now. When? When you're 80? You think it's so easy getting married? What's the big deal? You go to church and you get married. Hey, would you two marry me? Why don't we all get married? If I got married, my wife would have to make me two pounds of potatoes with meat sauce every day. Man, are those potatoes good! That's nothing. It's easy to make potatoes in meat sauce. I'd have her make gnocchi. No main dish-- just gnocchi. Let me tell you how love is born In case you don't know I'll kiss you softly and lightly brush your lips I'll stand so close to you My shoe! Domenica! Mariella! Come on up, but be quiet on the stairs! Good afternoon. Well, aren't you coming in? Don't just stand there. The door. I've been waiting for ages. Since 2:30. I was about to leave. Who are these boys? Friends of ours. Francolicchio and Pipito. - Have a seat. - Thank you. What are you doing? I want you to hear a good record. Don't insist, Milli. I can't. Come on, please. No, really, I can't. Come on, please. Okay. It's in my room. Did you see how good-looking she is? What a looker! How old is she? - Twenty. - Can't be. She's 17, like me. - You're 16. - Well, I'm almost 17. Listen to this record. It's really good. Of course it's good. That's my song. Let me tell you how love is born In case you don't know I'll kiss you softly and lightly brush your lips I'll stand so close to you That's how, without a sound love is born In case you don't know Never Never again Just like a butterfly Are you engaged? Us, engaged? What are you waiting for? Go on, dance. I'll put on some good dance music. Wanna dance? I don't know how. Dance with him. Wanna dance? Come on, dance with me. Are you shy or what? We just don't know how. Forget about them. Let's you and me dance. Too bad. If I'd known you were bringing friends, I would have fixed something. We could do it tomorrow. We could be here at 4:00, when we get off work. 4:00 is perfect. My mother goes out at 3:00 and doesn't come back until 8:00. We'll have loads of time. What are we gonna make? - Gnocchi. - And potatoes with meat sauce. Sure, gnocchi and potatoes. But you have to bring the food. My mother doesn't leave me any money. Of course we'll bring it. You guys bring the food, and we'll cook. I'll write down the ingredients for you. Okay. Four pounds of potatoes... six ounces tomato paste... Four pounds of potatoes, six ounces of tomato paste, six ounces of ground beef and a bottle of wine. We'll need at least 2,000 lire. - So what? - So it's a big deal. - We'll get it somehow. - Where? How? We just have to find it. Soldiers are lucky. All they do is sleep. You should show some respect. Don't you know who he is? Who is he? Dummy. He's the Unknown Soldier! I'm gonna stuff myself tomorrow. My belly will be out to here. Would you have a comb? Damn, I left mine at home. Here, I have one. - Would you like an American cigarette? - Thanks. How come you're not with your girlfriends? We just walked them home. Good for you. So now you're alone. That's right, all alone. Don't you ever talk, blondie? Cat got your tongue? What should I say? Your friend is shy. Want to take a little walk with me? Let's go, Pipito. We've got things to do. Wait, Francoli'. We won't do anything with him. We'll take his lighter. Did you see it? It's gold. He keeps it in his raincoat. Leave me alone. Come on, don't worry. We won't do anything with him. How else are we gonna get the money? We'll look like jerks tomorrow. Come on! - What's your name, wild boy? - Francolicchio. What did you say? Francolicchio. What a cute name. Where do people come up with them? Is that a real name? What about you, you little animal? I've got a name, you know. It's Pipito. Look who I've ended up with! - Come on. - Aren't you coming? - It's sandy. I'll slip. - Come on. We'll give you a hand. - What, are you doing a striptease? - I don't want to get dirty. Come on. Hold my coat and wait here. Come on. Let's get out of here. I didn't do anything! Of course not. If you were innocent, why did you run away? It's all because of that lighter. Then what happened? Go on. What happened? What happened? You know as well as I do. Pass the ball over here. What do you want? Over here! What do you want? The cops are here to arrest you. They're at your house. What are you talking about? They want to throw you in jail. Did they go to my house too? Francolicchio, run! My God! I can't go any further. Come on. We can't let 'em catch us. They're not gonna catch me. I won't let 'em. Francoli', come back! I'm scared! What are you doing? Francoli', don't run away. Stay away from the middle! What am I gonna do? I can't swim! I'm scared! Where am I gonna go, Francoli'? Don't go off without me! I can't swim! I can't swim! Don't run away, you coward! Coward! You have to help us. Perhaps you've left out some crucial detail. Try to remember. I don't even know what she looked like. It was dark. I couldn't see a thing. Besides, she was far away. Then I went home. It was chilly. Damn, it's cold! Where are you going in those clogs? Aren't you cold? My clogs? I always wear them. I work in my clogs. - It's become a habit. - Nice habit. - Where are you from? - I'm from Friuli. That's what I thought. - What are you doing in the park? - I don't know where to go. I don't know anyone. Now you've met someone important-- me! I had a friend from Friuli. She was a really good girl. Wait here. I'll go first. I had a friend from Friuli. A really good girl. And she was shrewd. Girls from the north get more respect. Everyone respected and admired her. But I know why that is with you northerners. Why? You talk so well. It's that beautiful accent. I can't get enough of it. Say something for me. What do you want me to say? I don't talk much. You're not shy, are you? Me, shy? I'm no kid. She wrote me last Christmas. She's quit working the streets, and she's gonna open a bar. But she didn't include a return address, so I couldn't write back. Maybe she thinks I'm dead. - You out of work? - No, I've got a job. Who dresses you like this? You're a strange one, you know. - Hey, you got the money? - Of course I've got it! Calm down. I'm short of breath. I can't climb those steps for nothing. I always meet the most desperate guys. First they act like big shots. But when it's time to pull out the 1,000 lire... Climbing up and down these steps leaves me short of breath. And since they know I'm a soft touch, all the low-lifes come to me. The other night one of them started crying on me. You've got me all wrong. I don't cry with hookers. Let's go down this way. Come on. Come on over here. Don't be afraid. I come here all the time. Set your purse down. You're not gonna hold on to it, are you? Why should I set it down? Does it bother you? Let go! Let go of my purse! Help! Help! Stop yelling! Be quiet. Don't yell. What do you want from me? I didn't do anything! Let me go! I didn't do anything! Natalino! She was a whore! She was a whore! What did I do? What did I do wrong? ...and the Grim Reaper of Giulia Street raises her scythe once again.
