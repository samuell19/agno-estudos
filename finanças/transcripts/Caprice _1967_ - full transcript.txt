[Gunshot] [Gunshot] [Gunshot] [Gunshot] [Gunshot] [Gunshot] [Frequency Tuning] Mademoiselle? This way, please. Pardon me, mademoiselle... but I notice you are doing the New York News crossword puzzle. Would you know 14-down, a five-letter word meaning "compensation for services"? The word is "money." Yeah, of course. How stupid of me. And it's not 14-down. It's 23-across. Yeah, of course. May I join you? [Pocketbook Snaps Shut] Take off your trousers. What do you mean? I must be sure you don't follow me. Trousers, or no deal. Uh, would you have these pressed, please? Thank you very much. Miss Foster? Inspector Kapinsky, French Sûreté. You are under arrest. - Afternoon, Sir Jason. - Cutter. Well, we caught her, red-handed and flat-footed. Yes, I still can't believe it. Patricia Foster, one of my most trusted employees. - How did it happen? - Well, I got the tip that she had some information to sell. I called the Sûreté. They arranged the Eiffel Tower rendezvous. - It was really quite simple. - Well, I appreciate it, Cutter. I appreciate it. But I still don't understand it. Why did she do it? It couldn't have been for money. What, in heaven's name, was the reason then, Patricia? Don't just stand there. Don't you realize the enormity of your crime? You were caught in the act of trying to sell the top secret plans... for our new roll-on underarm deodorant. I want this woman prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Sir Jason, one moment, please! - I want her put away for 20 years! - Sir Jason, you don't understand. Uh, Sir Jason, it is most unfortunate... but here in France... industrial espionage is not a felony. You can only prosecute for simple robbery... and the maximum sentence is only five years. - She should be put away for 10 years, at least. - Sir Jason, permit me. If you prosecute, there might be adverse publicity. The idea of cloak-and-dagger spies stealing underarm deodorants... could strike the public as pretty silly. [Chuckles] I mean, our companies could be laughed out of business. Miss Foster, you don't deserve it... but Mr Cutter here has prevailed on me not to prosecute. Good business practice forces me to yield to his argument. However, your contract with Femina Cosmetics is canceled. Beyond that, I intend to see to it personally... that no other cosmetic firm in Europe ever engages you. You have been a great disappointment to me, Patricia. [Engine Starts] Hello there. Free taxi, Miss, uh— Best deal in Paris Free taxi on a rainy night Refreshments en route. Napa, Sonoma, Mendocino. Comes in blanc and rouge That means white and red. 1967 was a great year for the Californian grape Wait a minute. Let me introduce myself. - I am Christopher White. - Take your hand off my arm. I consider your attitude toward this wine as being absolutely un-American. I said take our hand off my arm! [Groans] What are you doing here? Where's Christopher? - He's amongst the flowers. - Amongst the flowers? I sent him to pick you up! Oh, that's okay. We'll go to the airport and meet him there. Our plane leaves in a half hour. If another man takes my arm, I swear I'll— I am not going to the airport. I am going upstairs to bed. Do you understand that? And I doubt if you'll get a big mention in my prayers tonight. But there's nothing up there. I had all your clothes, your personal things moved out. They're down at the airport. You did what? How dare you go into my apartment like that? I'm going to call the police. What are you doing? Mustn't be unkind to Mr. Cutter. In we go. Watch the head. Let me out of here! If you're not nice, you may end up in the Bastille. [Sighs] For what? An underarm deodorant. Well, in some places, stealing an underarm deodorant is considered a capital offense. You were sabotaging the national armpit. I'm the spy who came in from the cold cream. I told you the reason for my interest. You need employment. I'm offering you employment. You were Sir Jason's top industrial designer. I'm offering you a job in the same capacity. Of course, at an increase in salary. I don't think the old boy was paying you enough. Mr. Cutter, Sir Jason said he was going to keep me from working. In Europe. He can't stop you from working for me in the States. Is it a deal? With one stipulation. - I will not divulge any of Sir Jason's plans. - Well, of course not. I wouldn't consider giving you a job if I thought you couldn't be trusted. Thank you very much. Well, welcome aboard. - My name is Christopher White. - How do you do? Look who's come back to Mother. Hi, baby How was the trip? Hi, Chris! I've been waiting for you. Nice to see you all again. - I've known them for years. They started in detergents. - Oh, really? ♪♪[Jazz] You see, once you've seen one studio, you've seen them all. I wouldn't miss it for the world! Whee!

Don't over-train. She used to model tractors in Budapest. She defected, but she makes a— Excuse me. - She makes an excellent goulash. - Oh, really? - What do the other two do? I mean, make? - Let's go for a take! - ♪♪[Ends] - Hello, Shamroy. I'd like you to meet Miss Foster. - How do you do? - Eye shadow or lipstick? Our new industrial designer. - What a waste of talent. - Thank you. Okay, Mandy, we're ready for you! [Mandy] Coming! [People Chattering] - [Man] Okay, quiet, please! - [Bell Ringing] - Quiet! - Okay, we're ready! Turn 'em! Take one, May Fortune Dusting Powder commercial. Oh, my! And how do we like our little pad? Oh, it's marvelous, Christopher. Oh, I won't want to work. I'll tell you that much. Oh, you'll adjust. It's nice to see you smile again. For a while back there, I thought that you were rather unhappy. Unhappy? When? When you saw the brunette with the dusting powder... I thought you might have known her. The brunette with the dusting pow— Oh, you mean the model? Oh, no. No, I didn't know her. I think I'm just tired. - I haven't adjusted to the time change yet. - Jet lag. Neither have I. - Besides, it's midnight in Paris. - Is it really? - Yes. You'll feel better when you've had some food. - What are you doing? I know a little bistro. The chef is a great friend of mine. I love your bistro. Oh, and the chef— Oh! Considering I learned to cook on a cricket scholarship— For an Englishman, you make a good brew. Well, to Lady Bird. Oh! Thank you. To Grandpa Bird. [Phone Ringing] [Ringing Continues] Christopher, it's none of my business... - but the phone has rung eight times during dinner— - [Ringing Continues] - And I haven't answered it. - Yes! I mean, no! I see. You don't want me to spend the evening talking to other people... when I could be talking to you. You see, when I'm out with a woman, she has my complete attention. - Your complete attention. - Complete. - How do you ever get anything done? - Done? Mmm. I mean, giving all your women such complete attention. You certainly can't find much time for anything else, can you? Hmm. You mean the models? [Chuckling] They're just friendly. I didn't say they weren't. To be honest, it is rather easy for an Englishman in this country. It seems that most American girls like Englishmen Mmm? They see Sir Laurence's movies on the late show, they play the Beatle records... and they think that all Englishmen are as charming as they are. Except smart girls like you, of course. It so happens I find you very charming. Tell me something. In Paris, why did you try to pick me up? Hmm? Well, you see... I have this little problem. That's why I tried to make it with a perfect stranger. I'm as insecure as any civilized man. [Phone Ringing] Look, I don't know about you, but that phone is making me very nervous. - [Ringing Continues] - It is also making me nervous. Let me take you away from all this. I have a room without a phone where I study. [Ringing Continues] You're kidding. [Laughs] - Does it swing? - It's a swinging bed. [Patricia] I believe it Try it. Come along. - What are you doing? - Relax. Relax. Now—You just wait a minute there. Now, just try it. It's nice and comfortable. Christopher, you're rushing me. I always wait at least an hour after eating. I saw you stifle three yawns during dinner. Remember, it's dawn in Paris now. So come along, don't fight it. Just relax. Relax. Is it dawn in Paris? - Christopher? - Mmm? Did you ever go to Les Halles for onion soup and eat with the truck drivers just as the sun was breaking through? I was one of the truck drivers. [Chuckles] Sure you were You know, I have a feeling that you don't quite trust me. You're right. But I trust Sir Laurence. To be or not to be? That is the question— Whether it is nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune— That's very good! Or to take arms against a sea of troubles... and by opposing end them. I'm enjoying your performance, Richard... but, oh, it's late. Uh, to die, to sleep... to sleep no more... perchance to dream. Ay, there's the rub. For in that sleep of death, what dreams may come... when we have shuffled off this mortal coil... must give us pause. I'm going to ask you questions, and you will answer them truthfully. Won't you, Patricia? When you worked as a trusted assistant to Sir Jason... you had full knowledge of all plans and production secrets... hadn't you, Patricia? Is it not true that Femina Cosmetics contemplate putting a new glamour wig on the market? Yes. What prompted Sir Jason to go into the glamour wig field? [Sighs] The development of a new formula. What does the formula do? Formula 4X361... changes the consistency... of inexpensive animal hair... to the consistency of the finest human hair. What does the formula consist of? [Exhales] Formula 4X361... is a lanolin-based preparation. First, the cholesterol compounds... are treated with a weak solution... of alkali and emulsion. [Chuckles] Well, that's it, Mr. Cutter? Man, I'll say that's it. Well, you have an assignment, White. I want you to stay with Operation Foster. I want you to be her friend, her pal, her buddy. Wine her, dine her, be her lover. Oh, the fun I could have if I were only working for me. Good morning, my dear. Good morning! Sir Jason, you didn't tell me you had a 707 super jet private office It's only a charter. Besides, it's the only place I could find to conduct business in private. Of course, there are those who think I'm a little theatrical. They're jealous because your theatrics are successful. - Then you have the job with Cutter? - Yes. Good. I knew he'd tumble for it. We're all set. When I go to the movies, I go all out. Movies? Oh, no, thank you. I've just had a big breakfast and an even bigger line... served to me by Mr. Cutter's assistant. Yes, Christopher White is rather good at that sort of thing. Mmm. Now you're going to see the biggest advance in the cosmetic industry. [Sir Jason] Forgive the poor film quality My cameramen were hiding behind some rocks at Malibu Now, watch this And remember, this is happening in salt water. There! Have you ever seen anything like that? Never! She came out of the water, and her hair was dry. Watch closely [No Audible Dialogue] - Well, it has to be one of your new wigs. - It's not a wig. - It's a new hair spray. - A hair spray? A water-repellant hair spray Which means that when a girl sets her hair... it's going to stay like that come rain, sleet, snow or any other act of God. Really? It's just fantastic! Fantastic. But, unfortunately, a development of the May Fortune Company. Which means that once it's put on the market, all existing hair sprays will be obsolete. That's why I had to put you through those elaborate machinations... to get you inside their plant. I must have that formula, or at least a lock of that Chinese girl's hair. We can make it out from that Now you'll have access to every part of the May Fortune plant. That man you saw wearing the cap? He's the inventor, Dr. Stuart Clancy. He's their chief cosmetic chemist. Here's his dossier. I want you to get to know him well. Bring me that formula... and you shall receive a bonus that you can retire on. Okay. I just hope I don't crack. You won't. Well, if I do, you can name a freckle remover after me. [Door Closes] Good morning. For me? Oh, how sweet! And you've kept them in water! Thank you, Christopher. Really, it was very thoughtful of you. Really it was. And I am sorry that you can't stay, but feel free to call anytime. Whew! But, Dr. Clancy, is it really safe... to keep your secret formulas in that index file? - I should think that a steel vault would— - I think it's safe. Walk in there once, Miss Foster. - What do you mean? - Go ahead. - Just walk in here? - Uh-huh. Ohh! What on— I hope it didn't frighten you, Miss Foster. Well, I may faint, but I think I'll live. When anyone gets within three feet of the index... they break an electronic beam... which causes the door to come down. And if anyone should invent an electronic can opener... and steal this work sheet... of a new face cream we're bringing out next year... it still wouldn't be much help to them, would it? Oh. Electronic ciphers. No, it wouldn't, not without the electronic decoder. Which is kept under guard in another building. - You're kidding. - No, no, no. You can see why my secrets remain secrets. [Laughing] Indeed I can, Dr. Clancy. You know, it's really kind of funny. What's funny, Miss Foster? Well, that steel door slamming down in there... and the electronic ciphers... and the electronic decoder being guarded in another building. All of these things guarding an insignificant thing like a face cream. You have to admit that's pretty funny. Right? - Insignificant? - Well, yeah. The way your formulas are being guarded... you'd think that you had invented a sort of miracle drug. My cosmetics are miracles. Come in, Miss Foster. Sit down. Here. Here. Over here. Sit where the genius sits when he creates his "insignificant" miracles. - Oh, Dr. Clancy, l— - Oh, never mind. Here. Sit back. Sit back. Relax. You would think they were miracle drugs if they didn't exist. Here we have a woman who believes my cosmetics are miracles! Look at what her husband has the privilege of waking up beside every morning Do you wonder that his secretary looks good to him? Hell, Miss Foster, the bus driver would look good to him after that! Women like that make a man want to end his life— Bang! Bang! You get the idea, Miss Foster? Bang! Bang! Oh, yes, Dr. Clancy. Bang! Bang! Now watch the miracle I've created around her eyes. Dr. Clancy, thank you, but I do have to— When I have finished, Miss Foster! Sit down! - Well— - Sit down! How's that for eyes, Miss Foster? Now, for those pale, cracked lips. Her husband can't wait to get back home after a hard day and cover them with kisses Damn it, Miss Foster, he'd rather kiss the bus driver! Voilà! Hmm. If this keeps up, her husband won't want to leave for work in the morning. Eh, Miss Foster? Then, with my depilatory cream, I removed her mustache... and the hair from her cheeks changed her skin from leather back to skin again, shampooed her hair and, as a final touch, perfumed her all over. And, as they say... before and after. She's beautiful. Now, think of the future, Miss Foster... when I can give women a permanent makeup... a new face that cannot be wiped off... a lifetime beauty mask. That, Miss Foster, is why I take precautions and guard my future plans. I don't want anyone stealing them! Dr Clancy, I really do understand and I want you to know that I find it incredible... that one person could create all those remarkable preparations. Thank you very much. Who finds it incredible? If I— I do. You said it's incredible that only one person is responsible for these products. Are you insinuating that it's not so? Of course not, Dr. — Is that what Cutter thinks? Is that what he wants you to find out? That's why you've been asking me all these questions today. Matt Cutter sent you to spy on me. Didn't he? Dr. Clancy, that's ridiculous! - I'm just here to orient myself to— - [Knocking] - [Woman] Dr Clancy, are you all right? - What? Oh. Oh, Su. Yes. - Well, then open the door. - My secretary. She'll hate you for upsetting me. Hide. Hide. What's the matter with you? - Nothing I'm all right - You don't look all right. You're going to take one of your pills, and that's that - What was it that got you all upset again? - Uh, nothing. Nothing. What you need is a little vacation Why don't you go away? What I need is to be left alone. [Gasps] Oh. - You scared me. - Is something wrong? - No, I'm fine, thank you. - I've been looking all over for you. - Have you? - Mm-hmm. Well, you probably didn't recognize me without my bathrobe. By the way, your flowers are doing very nicely. I'm sorry about all that water. I'll accept your profuse apologies over lunch. Oh, I um— Oh, um, I'm sorry, Christopher. I made an appointment. Uh, dinner, then? I'd love it. Uh-huh. What time? About 8:00? - Good. See you then. Bye-bye. - Okay. Bye-bye. I got the whole day off. Oh, Su, that's great. How groovy. I just can't wait to get in the pool. - If I could only get one day off. - Me too. Your boss is getting married, isn't he? Yeah— Oh, you should see this woman. - The redheaded one? - Well, if you call that red. There's black roots that deep. - Oh, I know what you mean. - Oh, what a drag. [Chattering Continues] - I know somebody who's really good for you. - Who? [Chattering Continues] - Okay. I was supposed to go. - What happened? Three kids and a wife. [Chattering Continues] [Whispers] That's it! Hey! You wanna come out, Tiny? - Tiny? - [Growling] [Phone Ringing] [Ringing Continues] Hi. It's me. [Laughs] I can make it tonight. Oh, don't worry about him 9:00 at the Carthay Theater Bye [Crash] - [Barks] - What's the matter? [Barking Continues] [Barking Continues] - [Barking Continues] - Go on, boy. Go. Go see what it is. Tiny, are you okay? Tiny! Tiny What did you find, Tiny? Nothing, right? Come on Let's go, baby - [Barking] - Tiny! [Su] Quiet, Tiny! [Tiny Growls, Barks] [Growling Continues] [Barking] Tiny! What's the matter with you? Hi, beautiful! Hello there, Tiny! How are you? [Shutter Clicks] Oh, I thought of you here all alone in that bikini and I said to myself, "What am I doing at the office?" Especially after the time I've had with the latest idiot they've hired. She doesn't know the first thing about cosmetics or— Don't— Don't upset yourself. You'll get one of your headaches again. I've got one of my headaches again. That fool woman gave me a beaut! "Insignificant thing like a face cream." That dame! [Shutter Clicks] [Gasps] Have you everything set up? I will have her there in one hour. Here she is coming now. [Panting, Gasping] Ohh! Hello there. I didn't know we enjoyed mountain climbing We ought to try it together sometime Poor Patricia. You've had a rather rigorous day. First you run afoul of Dr. Clancy. Then you sneak down the side of a mountain Too bad you didn't steal the water-repellant hair spray. You could have used it— What are you doing here? Oh, we do look a mess, don't we? Come along. Ah! No karate this time. I'll tell Sir Jason. - Sir— - [Whispers] Sir Jason. - [One Heel Clicking] - I don't know what you're talking about. I can't quite understand why Sir Jason picked you. Look at that dress, for instance. I could spot you from Sunset Boulevard. I neglected to tell you something. I am also on the payroll of Sir Jason. Oh, you can trust me. See, I'm the most reprehensible, the most obnoxious of spies— I am a double agent. Only my loyalties are with Sir Jason. In we go, madam. Sir Jason didn't think that you'd quite trust me... so he gave me his private phone number where you can reach him... and verify everything that I have said. I'll take you to lunch at Century City.

How did you ever fool a wise old bird like Sir Jason? What do you mean, fool him? Well, you were after this woman... and somehow, I believe, it lead you to Sir Jason.

He wanted me to get the water-repellant hair spray, and that's exactly what I did. You mean you got the water-repellant hair spray? Yes, I have— right here. I stole it from the Chinese girl's apartment. Christopher, get in the boat. Quickly! Get in the boat! It's a shark! Get in the boat! - Christopher, get in the boat! - I'm trying desperately Get away from— You monster! Get out of here! Get out of here! Go on! Get— Get out of here! Oh. Chris. Oh. And what were you swinging at? - There was a shark. - Shark? Sharks don't come in that close. Oh, if anything had happened to you. [Vocalizing] [Patricia] What does it say? "Schweizer Krone." It's a company in Lausanne. They manufacture the best atomizer bottles. - And May Fortune uses their bottles? - Too expensive. Cutter uses a cheap spray can manufactured over here. Well, then why would Clancy put his secret spray in a Swiss bottle? I don't know. Who can understand a man like Clancy? Huh? Sorry for being so damn clumsy this afternoon. It's my fault— putting you in Flipper-infested waters. Why would Clancy use a Swiss bottle? I do believe you have just changed the subject... and not too adroitly. Clancy seems to prefer just about everything Swiss. He even married a Swiss girl. - He's married? - Was. His children go to school there. He visits them— and to ski. He could've been a champion skier... if he wasn't a bigger champion in the cosmetics field. Let's stop talking about Clancy, and I'll take you to dinner. - Hmm? - Oh, fine. - But, uh, I can't go like this. - Why not? - I look a mess. - Yes, you do. You may pick me up at 8:00. [Rings] Good afternoon. Dr. Clancy's office. I'm calling from Bullock's department store. Someone purchased a gift for, uh, the children of a Dr. Stuart Clancy. And we'd like to make sure that we have the correct address in Switzerland. Would you give me that, please? Uh, the address is 36 Rue d'Alpine... Le Blanc Village, Switzerland. - Thank you so much. - You're welcome. - Who were you giving my children's address to? - Bullock's. Someone ordered a present to be sent to your children. They wanted the address. [Glass Tinkling] - There we are, my dear. - Thank you. It was so nice of you to give me a lift. That's all right. I was on the way to Paris anyway. - Cheers. - Cheers. But Switzerland? Are you going to ski? Mmm. Hardly. I'm working for you, remember? - I'm your secret agent. - [Chuckles] I promise not to pry. Oh. Sir Jason, I just thought of something. Would you have your Paris lab analyze these ashes, please? - Ashes? - Mmm. - Of course. - Thank you. Please don't continue to astonish me, Patricia. I can resist anything except that. Cheers. Cheers. [Bell Dinging] Hello? Je suis Madame Piasco Madame I'm interested in this, um, lovely bottle. Oh, excuse me, please. Come in, please. Thank you. I'm working on a new formula for eye shadow. I hope it will be a success. Oh, please, sit down. - Do you make your own cosmetics? - Bien sûr Everything I sell is made right here in this old laboratory. Since my grandmother first made, uh cream to protect the faces of her children from chafing during the winter months. That, uh, first cream was made of goats' milk. It was very good and soon all the parents had her making it for their children. And so my grandmother's goat barn became this laboratory. Madame, I was attracted to this— Ah, yes. Caprice. Oh, this is another of my little concoction. It is merely a water-repellant hair spray I developed it for myself. Oh, some years ago Uh, you see, I do a lot of skiing. You do? I do too. Then you will keep this bottle of Caprice. It is a must for women like us. It keeps the wind and the humidity from ruining our hair. Thank you. If it'll do all that, I should have a half a dozen. That will not be necessary. In another month, you will be able to purchase Caprice in America. - May Fortune is bringing it out. - May Fortune, huh? Their head cosmetician is my son-in-law. He manufactures all my little preparations. - [Bell Dinging] - Grand-mère! - Grand-mère! [Children Speaking French] Shh. You see we have a guest. Uh, as I was saying... I gave the water-repellant hair spray formula to Stuart. And, uh, you can see the lovely grandchildren he has given me. Now, Jeneatte, and you too, Jacques, say to mademoiselle... "Welcome to our village." [Together] Welcome to our village, Mademoiselle. Would you show me exactly where it is, please? It is right here that the Interpol agent was killed. - Uh-huh. - His name was Fowler. He was an American. Oh. We never talk of the killings in these mountains. - It's bad for business. - Mm-hmm. You want to go there? Why? You know us American tourists. We're nosy. Oh, it's all right to be nosy, but be careful. That part of the mountain— It's not good for skiing. The mountain drops off steep. [Engines Winding Down] [Gunshot] [Gunshot] [Gunshot] [Gunshot] [Gunshots] [Gunshot] There she is. Grab it, Pat! - Grab it! - [Gunshot] We've gotta get out of his range. She'll go over the cliff Lower it down Forget it. I'm not gettin' shot at. I said lower down, or you'll wish you were shot at! [Gunshot] [Screaming] [Gunshot] [Gunshot] [Chattering] - Monsieur White. - Yes, Lieutenant. Any luck? It got too dark, but we'll continue the search as soon as there is morning light. - Very good. Good night. - Good night. - How is she, Doctor? - With a good night's sleep, she'll be back to normal. She, Doctor, will never be normal. - I'll see her tomorrow. Good night. - Good night, Doctor. - Hello? - [Patricia] Hello - And how are we? - Fine, thank you I have an idea you saved my life. Routine. I couldn't stand being stood up. Male ego. I'm sorry about that. You're a pretty good detective. I'll say that. Right? Uh-uh-uh. I noted your sudden interest when I told you that Clancy came here to ski. And somehow in that mad, amateur agent brain of yours... you somehow tied that in with your father being killed on a ski run here. I took the first available flight In Zurich, I telephoned this hotel They told me you had gone skiing, and I hired a helicopter. Why did you come in such a hurry? - You think Clancy is dangerous too. - Nutty, but he is not dangerous. Christopher. I think he tried to kill me today. [Scoffing] I think you're delirious. It couldn't possibly have been Clancy. Look, this town is snowed in. The only way to get here is by helicopter. I checked with the landing field. Only two people have arrived here today from Le Blanc. Both women— you and someone else. No Clancy. That's enough conversation for one evening. - Good night. - Christopher. Here's the bottle of water-repellant hair spray for you to give to Sir Jason. And you can also tell Sir Jason that this bottle can be purchased openly... in this little Swiss village for $1.25... and that it was invented by a woman... who just happens to be Clancy's mother-in-law. How about that? How very interesting. Good night. If you need me, I'm down the corridor. Room 5. Oh! You stupid— Idiot! [Shower Running] [Affecting British Accent] Hello And how are we? [Drops Accent] You big phony! It didn't surprise you one bit when I told you... that bottle of hair spray could be bought for $1.25, did it? And why didn't it surprise you? Because you didn't want it in the first place, did you? And if you didn't want it, then Sir Jason didn't want it either, did he? So from the start, he's had me chasing around after something... - he never really wanted at all. - Bull's-eye. Then what's the reason for all of this, darling? I'll explain to you as soon as I slip into a— Oh. Hair spray. [Clicks Tongue] [Sighs] Of course, if— if you had trusted and cooperated with me in the first place... you would not have had so much trouble. - Oh, really? - Please sit down. Ten years ago, Dr. Clancy was the chief cosmetic chemist for Sir Jason. Wha— - You're kidding. - Oh, no. Only all his creations were imitations of other companies' products. Sir Jason fired him, he went to work for May Fortune... and became their chief cosmetic chemist. And strange things began to happen He became successful. Oh, everything he created became successful. And now the water-repellant hair spray. Sir Jason knew that Clancy couldn't have created all these things... and that somebody else must have been behind him doing the job. And he wanted that somebody working for him. You mean that Sir Jason didn't know that Madame Piasco was behind Clancy? [Laughs] He doesn't even know it yet. I know it sounds all so unrealistically simple now that you've discovered that Clancy's mother-in-law was the cosmetic genius. You have done a good job for Sir Jason. But tell me, how does Madame Piasco fit in as your mystery woman? I don't know what fits in where. I am too tired to even think about it. [Sighs] Well, stop thinking, and back to bed with you. Oh, I'm so happy this job is over. It is not quite over yet. Well, it is as far as I'm concerned. I found the hair spray, and, whether he wants it or not, that was my job. Uh, I want you to do me one favor... before we get Sir Jason out of our lives forever. Our lives? I've decided you need someone to take care of you. And by unanimous vote of one... I've elected myself to the post. It's a unanimous vote of two. - There he is now. - Who? - Clancy. - Clancy? - [Patricia] I told you he was here - He only got in this morning He couldn't possibly have shot at us yesterday Look, would I let you walk into any kind of trouble? Hmm? Now look, I've told him you wanted to speak with him, and he's— - Me? - Yes. Christopher, what would I talk about? Tell him that you're a— an agent for Femina Cosmetics. Christopher, I'm— I'm nervous about this. Look. Not a footprint. No one's been out here. You're quite safe. Now go on. - Good morning, Miss Foster - Good morning - I understand you met my charming mother-in-law - Yes, I did. I suppose you intend to blackmail me. Keep your mouth shut if I pay off? On the contrary, Dr. Clancy. You see, I am an agent for Femina Cosmetics... and I have been authorized to offer you the position... of head chemist with Sir Jason at double your salary... with an under-the-table bonus of a quarter of a million dollars. Miss Foster... you are offering me a quarter of a million dollars? - Yes, I am. - Under the table? Now, isn't that illegal? Oh, it's a handsome offer, but I'm very happy working for Matthew Cutter. I have no intention of leaving, no matter how much you offer me. And by the way, I've already told Mr. Cutter... that it is Madame Piasco who is the real inventor. So if Mr Cutter doesn't care whether it's my mother-in-law or me I don't care either Good day, Miss Foster. Perfect! That's it! Exactly what I wanted. [Laughs] With this film, we're gonna put Sir Jason out of business. Good job, Chris. Good job. How'd you do it, huh? [Laughing] Get her to fall in love with you? That's fool women for you— always trippin' over their hearts. - [Coughing] - Call the prefecture. Get Inspector Kapinsky to pick her up. [Coughing] I don't know where she is right now. - What? - Oh, relax. We'll pick her up when she leaves Sir Jason's tonight. Miss Foster is here, sir. - [Sir Jason] Oh, come in, my dear - Good evening, Sir Jason. - You look very busy. - Busy and excited Well, what do you think of this new bit of antiquity that has just arrived? This little lady is from 525 B.C. - "Before Cosmetics"? - [Chuckles] Beautiful, isn't she? Without face creams, antiperspirants or nail polish. I usually prefer these replicas to their living counterparts. Come and have a drink, my dear. No, thank you. I wanted to see you to extend my sincere thanks for a job well done. Yes, it was a job well done. But first, let us get on to my glad tidings. Congratulate me. I have just signed Madame Piasco as my head chemist. - I don't believe it. She would never leave her— - Her son-in-law? But she did. It all came to me while I was in my sauna. "What could possibly induce Madame Piasco... to turn her back on him?" I asked myself. At first, I seriously thought of buying her a Swiss alp... and naming it after one of her hair rinses And then it struck me. I promised to have her presented at court, and that did it. You see, the Swiss are essentially snobs. They invented democracy, but they're rather ashamed of it. - Apparently everyone has a price, Sir Jason. - Yes, my dear. A human frailty that keeps the wheels of commerce humming. What I'm about to tell you may come as something even more of a jolt. The lab report on the ashes you wanted me to have analyzed. The residue contains a powerful narcotic. - I know. - You know? Then why did you have me— I told you about my visit to the Chinese girl's apartment. At the time, I thought she was drunk. Well, she wasn't drunk. She was doped. I found a box of face powder and some ashes on her table... so I took some of the ashes and had them analyzed. If you already knew this, why did you have me repeat the analysis? Oh, of course You had to consider everyone a suspect in your father's murder, including me. Yes, I did. And if you had denied that those ashes contained a narcotic... then I would have had every reason to hold you responsible. Wouldn't I, Sir Jason? Lovely deduction. You really are rather an enigma, Patricia. But even enigmas can be arrested. - I suggest you go. Quickly. - What do you mean arrested? My private grapevine tells me that Matt Cutter has informed the Paris police... that he has in his possession motion picture films... of your attempt to bribe Dr. Clancy. That's impossible. No one could have photographed us. - We were in the middle of nowhere. - You're wrong. You see— And this is where you were a fool. You trusted Christopher White. Of course I trusted Christopher White. He wouldn't do a thing like that. - He couldn't have. - He would, and he did. You don't suppose that I told him to shoot the film, do you? If this film is shown on TV— as Matt Cutter intends doing— my company will be ruined. Sir Jason, Christopher White works for you. - Why would he— - Why would he ruin me? For money, my dear. Now put this coat on. You really have to go. I'm expecting him here at any moment... to tell me that he has uncovered some personal filth on Matt Cutter... that he will offer to sell me so that I, in turn... can blackmail Cutter from showing the film. And as usual, our Mr. Christopher White... will collect from both ends... in the free enterprise tradition of the double-dealing double agent. I can't believe it. Are you comparing your tawdry disillusionment to mine? What could he have been to you except a cheap opportunist? I lost an empress. Couldn't you have guessed that? And you've settled for a cockney version of James Bond. - I settled for nothing less than justice. - Justice? And I'm going to keep that double-dealing double agent from turning a profit. I'm going to recover that film from Matt Cutter's office tonight. Taxi! - Taxi, take me to— - Madame has transportation. Go on. - Oh, am I glad you're here. - Glad? I'm here to arrest you. You can't arrest me. Call Monsieur Auber at Interpol. - He'll explain everything to you. - Auber? Yes. Please call him now. [Speaking French] Oh! What— What are you do— Oh! - [Horn Honks] - Let go of me! [Horns Honking] Let go of me! Let me go, you— Come on. Come on. Don't argue. Faster. - Let go! - [Horns Honking] Oh! [Honking] - What are you doing? - I'm keeping you out of jail. - Don't be a hero. - I'm an antihero. Is that why you photographed Clancy and me? I am not going to let Cutter put you away. Now come on. I love you. - I love you! - Oh! I could hate you for this— for forcing me to tell you the truth. You wouldn't know the truth if it came with a syringe. How can I get the girl at the end unless I'm a good guy? It is my understanding that the narcotic is hidden in the face powder... and is not injurious to the skin. But... when set afire... and burned... and reduced to ashes it becomes a powerful hallucinogenic... distributed all over the world in that innocent May Fortune box. The only face powder in the world to send you on a trip. Ingenious— buy the powder for a dollar, sell the ashes for thousands. It's no wonder that May Fortune face powder's a number one seller. You bet it is. If you check the big buyers of that face powder in every country, monsieur... you will have the local heads of the drug syndicate. We want the top man, and that man must be Matthew Cutter. No. Matthew Cutter isn't smart enough. I'm sticking with my father's hunch that it's a woman. [Patricia On Radio] One, two, three One, two, three I'm in Matt Cutter's office right now - [Object Rattling] - Hey, wait a minute. I heard something down the hall Hold on. [Bucket Rattling] - It's okay. It was just the cleaning woman. - [Door Opens] [Bucket Clatters] Oh, madame. Madame, you can go It is not necessary to clean in here Vous pouvez partir, madame - [Vacuum Cleaner Whirring] - Madame, vous pouvez partir. [Shouting] Ce n'est pas nécessaire - [Loud Whirring] - What are you doing? Good evening, Miss Fowler. - Good evening, Dr. Clancy. - That vacuum isn't moving. [No Audible Dialogue] [Whirring Continues] I usually dress a bit more fashionably. I suspect your father was really taken with me— [Laughs] When we made our date to go skiing. No, no, no, no. Up. Upstairs. I figured you got wise to me when I gave you my cosmetic demonstration. I was wise to you before I met you. How interesting. Yes, but what was really interesting was the dossier I had on you, Dr. Clancy— all photographs of you with your women. - What do you mean? - Usually a man who has so many women... is trying to prove something, isn't he? But what he really likes is to go around dressed in women's clothes. - Shut up, you dirty— - [Screams] [Gunshot] Pat? Is that you? [Groans] [Screaming] [Patricia Screams] - Pat! - Don't answer him, my dear. Come. Quietly. Damn fool, that Clancy. Always a touch of melodrama. You're not surprised to see me? Not at all. You told Clancy I was here just as I intended you should. I knew that's what you wanted. It also afforded me an excellent opportunity to have him kill you... or you to kill him. What are you doing? As a final tribute, I'll name my freckle remover after you. After all, you always were my favorite puppet. Your favorite puppet has told the authorities all about your face powder. The May Fortune face powder. [Laughs] Poor, innocent Matthew Cutter. He'll go to jail for narcotics smuggling... and he doesn't even know that Clancy put the dope in the powder. His company will be ruined. Please get in, my dear. And I will have the cosmetic field all to myself... after your short trip across the English Channel. [Gunshots] Oh! Christopher! Help me! Christopher! What do I do? Help me! Help me! Oh! [Siren Wailing] - Look! - She made a perfect landing To die, to sleep no more. - And by a sleep, to say we end the heartache... - The heartache... [Together] and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation devoutly to be wished. I'm going to ask you some questions, Christopher... that you will answer truthfully, won't you, love? [Murmuring] Mm-hmm. - Do you promise to give up spying? - Mm-hmm. Do you promise to give up all women, except me? Mm-hmm. ♪♪[Woman Singing] ♪♪[Ends]
