You keep going to shootings. But nothing's happened to you yet. You're wasting your time on nothing. I have talent, okay? You'll find me useful someday. Yeah right... That's what your father said. What did he say? He said he'll be the next Lito Lapid. Fine. He jumped off a building. What happened? He broke his skull. He's so stupid. Daddy is different. I'm different. Idiot. Look at yourself in the mirror. Your face doesn't fit a lead role. Because you look like your father. It's okay, better than looking like you. You look like a villain. Son! - Father! - Son! Thanks a lot, dude. If it wasn't for you... Something bad might have happened to my son. Don't be emotional. Don-don is my godchild. And your son is not hard to take care of. He even sleeps alone here at night. He said he wants to get used to being alone. He's not a problem. He's not picky. He eats anything. Right? I'm impressed. He doesn't know how to cry. Brave. He once had a fight with a kid older than him... He beat him up. The other kid was already wailing but this one didn't even flinch. Is that true, son? Of course, dad. You and mother are not around so I have to be brave. Father is here now. We'll be together always. What about mother? Are we not going to visit her? Naytay, please give me money for my load. Topher's been texting me. He might think I have another love. Will you stop bugging me, Byuti? Instead of load, buy food. You're too corny. As if you didn't flirt around back in the days. Didn't you fall in love too? Well, so you're answering back now? I may have flirted a long time ago... but I know how to love. That's why you pawned the house for father's medication? I pawned it to save your father's life Because we love each other. Love each other? But father takes home different women. You even sewed his mistress. And even the money you gave my mother... You borrowed it from 5-6. What do you know about love anyway? What I know. Is that Topher loves me. Shut up, Byuti. Hey! What's the commotion? Why is there a lot of people? There's a shooting. Guys are going naked! Naytay, let's go and watch! There's a lot of men! Come on! - Put your hands up! - Hey, miss. Outsiders are not allowed here. Why mister? What are you here anyway? I'm a legman here. How? No, it should be like this. - That's it, grind it! - Wow, so you're popular. Okay then, let's be friends. By the way, my name is Star. Tonic is my neighbor. One of the members of Wild Boys. There he is! Move a little more! You too! Mister... Something seems to be alive in there... so mad. You might want to join them? Be quiet. Why? Are you even useful to me? Will you include me in your projects? What's the matter, Gloria? What? Let's go home! It's late. Aren't you tired? I fell asleep at home a while ago. After I finished cleaning my husband's grave. I forgot to do all my work. There's still tomorrow. What's wrong with you? When your boss, Luis, was still alive... You've been sewing him a hundred percent! Now that he's dead, don't tell me you'd still work 100%? Luis was only three years old that time. I was the one who took care of him. He became a teenager. He got married. He got sick. Died. I was the one beside him. He died before me. This is a job. What if Luis' wife comes here suddenly? And fire me? Who? Your cheap master? Hey. You're working so hard. But your salary is so small. I'm saving money. So I can buy the spot next to my husband. So we'll be buried beside each other. Crazy. You're still strong. It's too early to plan things for your death. We will all end up there. I'm already old, Dadeng. No matter when, I'm ready to die. Whatever. But me... I hope God won't take me yet. I don't want... I don't want to leave Byuti With a life without direction. You know what? A person has 2 kidneys. Even the other one will be taken off our body, we won't die. Is there an effect to our body if it's taken off? Darling, I won't lie to you. There is. Of course, we'll be a bit weaker while working. But if your resistance is strong, you can make it. It's nothing. But a piece of advice, after the operation, eat well. Then avoid carrying heavy things. How much will we get? Around 70,000. Of course, I already have a cut. How much will you get, Ms. Lucinda? Oh my. Just a small amount. I also pay for my contact. And we'll sign a contract. So there's no deception. Man, I think... our album will hit gold. The MTV is really good. We are all nude and the TF is really small. They only paid for our taxi fare. Lucky Films is building us up and giving us publicity. If you're a contract star of a big production company, our value gets high. We won't look cheap. Our booking gets higher. I hope that 20,000 is already net pay. Don't cut the 30 percent. What do you think of me? I did not increase your talent fee to get 30 percent commission. I'm not a cheater. I'm sorry, man, but I need 14,000. That's your problem. Now what? Are we going for this? I have others to replace you. I'm really sorry, man. This won't happen again. It's better to be sure. I didn't force you into this. Ahh... Which room? The guy's very macho, sir. Okay. Okay, sir. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Hey, man. I'm sorry for that. I'm only doing my job. Doctor, I want to get her now. So I could take care of her. I just have to settle some things. Call me first before taking her home so I can prepare Angela's release papers Because if we don't have the law, our country will be at chaos. Aren't we going to go near mom? We will take her out here. Man, we look like a kidnapper. Let's do it. Let's take your child. No, man. I'm happy just to see my daughter. How about Jennifer? You should get back together. She despises me, man. Let's go. You were referred to me by your former inmate. Your case was Estafa. I was just paid, sir, to admit the crime. Then they said I could be free. But the lawyer already hid. If you didn't help me, I wouldn't be able to get out. - Thank you so much. - That's nothing. But I will ask a favor from you. I will give you a job, not just any work. If it's a job, I will do anything. Do you know how to use a gun? I was a security guard before. You have potential. But don't disappoint me. You'll be pan of my crew. Take this. First payment. I want you to kill someone. He deceived our business clients. I could do other job even for a small salary. I don't want to go to jail again. Take the money. I will give you a gun for you to use. I don't like people who refuse me. Dad, aren't we going home? What's the commotion? Oh my, our date is so violent. A Chinese guy was killed. So there. They're making me crazy. Don't mind them. What's important is... ...we're together. Really? You know what, Topher? This is the happiest dinner for me. They have delicious food here. Thank you for the treat. Sure. Anything for you. Ahh... By the way... What happened at your school? That? That was irritating. It's my classmate who has camera and video cell phone. He's such a bragger. He flaunts it too much. Oh my, Topher. Don't worry. If I win the Lottery, I will buy you cell phones like that with nice cameras. It's okay if you don't. Being with you is fine me. You enjoy it, right? Do you really want to be with me? I'm happy with you. My problems disappear when I'm with you. You're the only one who makes me laugh. Now, you're making me a clown. You're very beautiful clown. You're irritating. I might believe myself to be beautiful. Am I really beautiful? Am I prettier than your female classmates? You're different. Really? My phone! My phone! Stop me. I'll pull the hair of that kid. You will pull your son's hair? No. That Topher. He smells fishy. I can feel that that kid's blood is green. Oh you really. Whoever you son likes, You judge him right away that he's gay. Your son looks happy with Topher. Happy? Why? Is that your reason when your husband left you? You let Donato live like that, right? Because he's happier with his mistress. Why do you have to bring back the past?! My situation is different from your problem. You know what, Gloria... Byuti is the only good memory... that Moises left me. I promised him... That I will give this kid a good future. Byuti will still be the one to decide to what kind of life he wants to do. I will leave him. He can't give me any project. You know what? Nothing will happen to you with your star thing and showbiz. I'm telling you nothing will happen to you. Because you can't be a bold star. Because... you don't have boobs. You didn't get any of my assets. That's one good thing you said. You gave me an idea. Didn't you know that there's a lot of starlet who turn famous because of being a bold star? I'll go now. Thank you. Hey! Such an arrogant kid. Look for others who can help you so you can finish your work. But remember this, I have to know the zodiac sign before I hire him. I don't like Leo. They're arrogant and they act like a king. I also don't like Libra. -They're hot-tempered, -Okay. I also don't like people who looks down. Those who are... Those who can't look at you straight. Those people like that. - Bless me, godmother. - God have mercy on you. Your friend is there. Go inside the room. Where were we? Those people who look down? They will stab you from behind. And they hide lots of fishy secrets. That girl is my goddaughter. Did you see her walk? Her butt goes in circles. That's a sign of flirtatious. But she's a good girl. She's a good kid. There was once who rented here. She's from Bicol, Malou. Her zodiac sign is Scorpio. I think Malou's peanut is distorted. Build the house beautiful and strong. Tonic wants it to be a condo in the area. So lots of people will like to rent it. Later, after this. I'll tell you your fortune. You're here. I don't want to stay at home. The witch and I fought. Don't mind her. You'll grow old. You really have lots of rituals. Can I see that. What's that you're putting on? To make my skin smooth. To be flawless. You know what, actors... They take care of their body. They even take glutathione. You might want to buy? I don't have racket. Where will I find money to pay you? Friend, what if I become a bold star? Help me join the Hot Girls. You should have boobs. Bombshell. You have small boobs. You're like my mom. She always insult me. Wait. Wait. Wait. I know someone who makes boobs. I will have botox. Because I have wrinkles and eye bags. Where will I find money for payment? X-deal. Let's be guest on TV. We will say his name. See? Now what? Is he a guy? He might just want sex. You talk like a virgin. What? Okay. Okay. ORGY! Just make sure he'll make my boobs bigger and beautiful. I'm sure of that. Hey Tonic! You might forget. We're only friends. Something happened to us before. I was sad. You're really a moron. Let's have respect. You're my only true friend left. And your baby doesn't want to. She looking at us. She said you're such a horny guy. My service is expensive. I think an X-deal is not enough. Your girl is pretty. Maybe I could hit on her. While she's not famous yet, you can hit on her. - Okay, this will only take an hour. - Okay, Doc. Son of a... What crazy thing did you do?! You told me I don't have boobs. So there, I found a way. It's beautiful, right? You know what? You're crazy. You could get cancer with that. When did you start being concerned? You're so pretentious, mommy. You know what? Deal with your life. Even here, Angela brought her profession as teacher. She's good in teaching. For sure, they will miss your wife. I will teach again. Thank you. What you have to do is write your name. And then, below that, put your favorite color... your favorite toy... your favorite number... and your favorite food. And then you can eat. I will check that later, okay? Go on, write now. At first, the parents are scared of letting their children come near her. Eventually, they let her be. Make your writing legible so I could understand it. After that and after you eat, We will go on to another subject. I will also give you a different snack. - Really, ma'am? - Go on, son. She looks for teaching. It's okay. As long as she has something to do. You know, Angela is a good teacher. She loves her students. I'm proud of her. Look at Dondon. He helps on sewing. Yes. He didn't go to school. He said, he'll help his mother. To support her. Later on, Angela's students will have their own responsibilities. Just to help each other. Are you sure you'll not sell flowers today? Byuti has no class. So I asked him to stay there. Make me beautiful. Wait. What's the occasion? It's our anniversary. You know, because I was busy with work, I've never tried to be beautiful for him. You... Now that your husband's dead, you want to be beautiful. My husband's mistress was so poised. She always smells good. Etang has lots of money. She lends money at the market. And she dressed up my husband. That's why you let him go. It hurts but I don't know how to fight. My hand gets itchy. What do you want? Slap her? Pull her hair? Go. Thick-faced. Go on. She's really thick-faced. You're an animal, my husband! You left me! You came back to me! But I never got mad at you! I didn't scold you! You're an animal! You're an animal! Go on! Curse him more! Motherfucker! Go on! Curse! You motherfucker! Go on! More! You hurt me but I never told you how painful it was! You motherfucker! You motherfucker! Motherfucker! You motherfucker! Damn you! Damn you! Here! Here! Here's Etang! Pretend that Etang is here with her arms on her hips. Curse on her! - Curse on her! - Damn you! You motherfucker! Motherfucker! You motherfucker, Etang! You stole my husband! You son of a bitch! Curse on yourself too. You motherfucker! Motherfucker! So stupid! Stupid! Stupid! I'm so stupid! Why did I let this happen?! Wait. Why did I curse myself? We could curse each other! Motherfucker! Go on! Motherfucker! Mother- Motherfucking agent! We have a taping today. It's making me crazy! It's out-of-town. You're going to the taping? Where are your things? I'll go back home. I'll get my things. I don't have money, friend. Can I borrow 200? Oh My! You're unlucky. I don't have cash here. They give me freebies. You're so cheap. Here's the secretary. Sorry, Tonic. Sir has a meeting. He can't meet you. Is that it? Inday, did he get my picture showing my boobs and my nipples? Maybe he put it on file. What? He just put my boobs and nipples on file? Tell us straight, today. Am I rejected? They'll just call us. Okay. Tell boss, thank you. Sorry. Don't give up. Okay? Now you're saying sorry! That's okay. I'm used to being rejected. I won't surrender. Surrender. Wait. I know someone who owns a club. Let's go there. Don't go to the taping. Are you crazy? I'm applying to be a bold star, not a GRO. You really... You're crazy! You're an asshole. It's you! It's you! - Man, stop her! - No! No! - That's enough! - Oh My! Don't stop me! Man, stop her! I don't even know her! Your underarm is smelly! You have bad odor! How are you? Here.. You believe her? She's selling you alive. So evil. She's taking too long. She doesn't have any concern. Hey, tell my mom, I have to go now. I have a shooting. I don't have money. Maybe you could lend me. 100 is okay. Please. I only have 80 pesos. Let's go. I'll walk you to the street. No, never mind. Thank you anyway. If one of your kidneys will be taken off, you won't be able to carry things. That's a joke. Bye! If I'm going to be another passersby, I'm going out of the taping. Being an extra is also tiring. You should stick with me. So you will be given a good role. Stop being an OPM. You know what? My PM receives money from catering. He receives money under the table because of me. That's why we should help each other, right? Okay. Fine. I don't want that! I can do a blowjob first if you like. Show me that you really have a connection to the production. You're unbelievable. I have a word of honor. Come on. Hey! If you don't want it, then don't! I'm not in the mood! My pussy gets tired of guys like you. Fine. Soup. You know what... Even if you're wearing a mask, your role is still important. You're the best friend of the lead role. Kids will remember your character, 'Tigra. What now? I'm always at the scenes but they can't even see my face. It's a fantasy series. I think you will become human eventually. Don't worry. I'll talk to the scriptwriter to make your character human. Whenever they're here, I serve them well. I will help you. Just do it. You talk too much. Let's do it there later. Ma'am, how are you? You'll take me in? Class, why are you here outside? We have a quiz today. Go inside the room. Hey! You really don't want to stop? Your scenes are finished. Let's do it here. I already talked to the watcher. Here?! We're doing it here? We might end up smelling like food. Please respect me. Popoy please. - Hey! - Someone might see us. No. Why is my wife crying? We haven't done this for a while. You don't want to give me a second chance because you are judging me. Okay! Don't make a scene here. We won't fight you back. You say that I'm crazy. That's why you don't want to fight back. But ma'am I'm now okay. I'm okay! You're more crazy than me. - We pity you. Please leave. - I don't need pity. I need you to understand. Ma'am, I need understanding. Tell me. Tell me. Tell me the criteria of a good teacher. Come on! Tell me what's wrong. Tell me. I'm sorry for this. Let's go, mom. Your students at home are waiting for you. Don't say sorry to them. Don't explain. I'm not here to fight. I'm just here to explain. I love you very much. I'm sorry. I was just desperate then. I was desperate that's why I used your money. Forgive me. I gave it... I gave it back to you. I gave your money back. You know... We were in debt. My husband and I were in debt. Oh My! My husband! My husband was put to jail. My husband... My husband was put to jail then... I didn't mean to get sick. Forgive me. Take me back. Take me back as... a teacher. Ma'am, I'm now okay. Have pity. Ma'am, come on. Take me back. I brought the money back. We were just in debt. And my husband was put to jail. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to get sick. Are you okay now? Why are you caging me here again? They're the crazy ones. I don't want to do this. I don't want to bring you back to... The mental hospital? It's better there. They believe in me. They respect your wife. They said... They said she's a good teacher. They said she teaches well. But they said they're family is crazy. You know what? It's good that I didn't come from a crazy family. Naytay, look at this! Hurry! - What's that? - Gift from Topher. So beautiful! I can hug this at night. - Crazy! - Ouch! Look. Don't believe to that guy too much. I have bad vibes on him. But... I have a birthday gift for you. - Really? - Yes. What's taking you so long? Naytay, this is so beautiful! But lightning might struck me. Crazy. There. You know what? Even if we don't have money... I never thought of selling it. Because I love your father. Maybe you're the one who bought this as a gift from my dad to you. I don't do illusions. That's a birthday gift from your father. Thank you, Naytay. Thank you. This is embarrassing. I even borrowed money for my gift for you. If you didn't lend me money, I can't give you a gift. - Go on. Open it. - I'll open it. Thank you. Oh! This is so beautiful! Thank you! You know, you really amaze me! Whenever you give me gifts, if not a phone, a necklace... Where do you get your money? Because you know what, Topher? I'm smart and witty. And I got my salary. I'm really lucky. You know, if you're a girl, maybe your now my girlfriend. Okay. Let's pretend your my girlfriend. Topher, I want it real. I don't want pretensions. You're irritating. Hey. Come on. Come with me to Dr. Casipit. I want to change my face. I will join the Starlet contest. You always go on auditions there every year. But they don't pick you. That's why I will change my face so they won't recognize me. I can feel that I'll be lucky this time. Come on. Come with me. Just go there. I don't go to Dr. Casipit for a longtime. That animal is so horny. I have anesthesia but I can really feel what he's doing to me. Hey you. We're inside the church. Go on. I'm praying. So I'll be lucky later. And my daughter's sick. Our friend texted me. Lord will take care of Princess. We're so pretentious to the Lord. We go to church but then we always do malicious things. Why is it closed? Dr. Casipit's clinic is gone? It's gone. The NBI raided it. He's a fake doctor. What? What will happen to customer? I'm done with it. I changed my mind. I'm taking the offer of going to Japan. And now you're backing out? Don't do this. Why? Did I receive any down payment? Now you're bothered. Maybe you already receive down payment. Motherfucker! Don't leave hanging. I'll tell the press of your bookings. You're an asshole. Before you tell the press, present yourself first. Your style's rotten. You put 50 percent on your bookings. They're the ones working but then you receive the same amount? I pay the amount we agreed on. I don't force people. That's the way I do it. Pimp. I'm sorry. I already called others if you can still wait. I'll give you back your payment. Take off your clothes. Sir, I already graduated from that. I'm sorry. You want your price higher? People know you do this. Take off your clothes. Take off your clothes. We both have bad luck, friend. Casipit's clinic is gone. And now you were hit. So you're a virgin from your butt. That's new. I pity you, friend. Don't pity me. I don't need you to pity me. This is my karma. You have money. It's okay. You should have a car. I don't know. Whenever it came from a bad thing, money slips away fast. So what I do is, I use it for good things. You don't book yourself now? I grew tired of it. I don't want people saying no to me. So before they reject me, or tell me I'm old, I will be the first one to refuse. So it won't hurt here. I started at 300 pesos. At lsetann. It's like all the gays in Manila were able to taste me. But not my butt. A blowjob is okay. Or me being on top. My motherfucking butt is gold. Motherfucker! I already graduated from being a callboy but I still got hit. Never again. Even if they'll get me high. I'll kill for my butt. This is the only part of my body that is not overly used. But then, bad luck. Because your penis is disgusting. It's over used. But when something happened to us You're the first girl I ever had sex with. Crazy! That's enough! Because you're gay! That won't happen again! We're not compatible. Just best friends. That simple. You just used me. I felt like I'm a walking penis. That motherfucking gay! He's so arrogant! He even insulted me before he hit me. I will sleep upside down for a week. Don't imprison me. It's hard for me. And I'm okay now. Okay- But promise me, you won't go back to school. Go eat. Take your medicine, okay? Let's protest to the tuition fee hike! By the universities and colleges! Education is our right. Lower the tuition fee! Raise the quality of education! - Higher! - Raise the quality of education! Have pity on our parents! - Higher! - Raise the quality of education! - Higher! - Raise the quality of education! Lower the tuition fee! Raise the quality of education! - Higher! - Raise the quality of education! - Higher! Higher! - Raise the quality of education! It's good you're here. Your wife's making a scene. She took her clothes off. I don't know what to do. I've been calling you. They said teacher's salary should have a raise! They should bring me back to teaching. Education is the most important thing now. Now we have to take our clothes off for them to see that we're doing is true. That we need education! That's important now! We have to take our clothes off for them to see -- Wait. Wait a minute! I'm here for the rally! Hey! Wait! I have to take my clothes off so they could be enlightened! We should enlighten them! Wait a minute! Your hair is really long. Oh, not really. What's your name? Christopher Po. Po? Hey, I'm still young and... juicy! Young? How old are you anyway, grandma? Maybe you're the same age as my dad. Really?! Such a flirty gay! Whatever. Don't be a snob to Mama Aissa. The winner of Star of Tomorrow is his boyfriend. He's a callboy. Maybe he has lots of money. Whatever! What I can say is I can buy. I'm not a denial queen. Mama has pension. His Canadian boyfriend sends him money. Oh really? I can't imagine it. It's too different. Hey Homo, you've said a lot. Mama Aissa might beat you up. He's a Waray. He's not afraid of anything but AIDS. Really? He's afraid of his clan. When we visit mom, Let's bring this to her so she could use this to teach others. Son... I'm sorry for what you're going through. Just give me more time. Your mother will be together with us. That's a promise. Don't make a promise. I'm not hoping for it. You don't trust me? Not like that. I just don't want to feel sad if you're not able to do your promise. You know, son? This will all end. Where's the necklace that I gave you? I kept it. It might be stolen. Just make sure that you kept it. If I see Topher wear it, I'm taking it away. Why do you always talk bad about Topher? He's so kind to me yet you're angry at him. What? Have you talked to them? Yes, they already agreed. I'll pay it with my service now that I'm still alive. And I'm paying for that space beside my husband's grave, too. I even have a little savings. I'll take care of the flowers. That would be my contribution for you. Your girlfriend might bitch at me. Who? Beauty? He's just like a friend to me and... I treat him like a brother. Really? How much? You're more important than money. You know... I feel something different for you. You know, it's hot in your parlor. It's hot? Yes. Botswana! Go get some water! Botswana! Come up here! Come down here! Come on, friend! Let's reach for the stars in heaven! You won't reach them! What are you? Superwoman?! Hey star! Fuck you! We have the same name! My name's Estrellie. Hey! Why are you ignoring me? Talk to me! You know... stars hate annoying people. They don't like to be reached. It would be better... if we dance. Let's try to catch their attention. - Very alive, I will never die! - Very alive, I will never die! My love for you can't be measured. Very alive... I will never die... I'm so tired, friend. I'm so tired of reaching for the star. You're giving up? I'm just tired. Very tired. Be like me. I don't get tired. I do everything. Being an actor... a prostitute... a pimp. You're just getting old that's why you do everything. Look at your hair, friend. It's getting thinner. The lines on your face are appearing! In showbiz. You're old when you're 25. You're already old! Even the poor gays here in our street... wouldn't even bother looking at you. - Oldie! - You're an idiot. I thought we're friends. Have I insulted you? What about you? Your vagina's so used but you're still an extra. I'm sorry too, friend. The boss wants me to talk to you because Wild Boys will be repackaged. All those who are above 25 will not be included in the group. You will be given another project. You just said it first. But I am leaving the group. Nothing's happening with our careers. We go naked for our promos. Do we earn anything? No! You've been pan of the group. Don't be like that. That boss! He always makes a promise but he doesn't fulfill it. If he doesn't need the talent anymore, he's treated as garbage. What they want is a fresh face. Someone who looks innocent. Don't say anything. A lot of you would be replaced. Then replace us! We don't need him. Your efforts are wasted, Tony. You're part of the original group. Why did they take you out just like that? Oh no! I would be next! I faked my age. They didn't cut me. I left. If I were you, if you're not happy, leave. Bold films are not popular now. It's good that we even had a sex video. Digital films are popular. They are sent abroad and shot with a small budget. It would be better if we go to Japan as hosts. It's hard to go to Japan now because they've tightened their policies. We should be thankful we have extra jobs. We should keep in touch. I'll take care of you guys. Stop following my daughter! Our child. But you have to accept the fact that we're not meant to be. I have a boyfriend and we're getting married. We'll leave for the States after our wedding. I accept the fact that we're over, but Princess... You can't take my child away from me. My family will never accept you! If Princess is old enough, I'll explain to her that I'm not the only bad guy in this world. I know... she will accept me. Enough of that drama! It's so cheesy! Go on and insult me. You know me, Jennifer. I won't give up. Whatever! Good Luck! Why are you sad? It's nothing. Aren't you and your father going out... to visit your mother? I have something for you. I'm just finishing up my job. Then, we'll move to another place. Where are we going, dad? With your mom... somewhere far from here... where nobody knows us. Don't you believe your father? It's because you're being emotional again. How's school? You're not procrastinating, are you? I'm saving up for your fees until college. It's good. I'm always the leader. Do well in school. By the way, what's your dream? Do you want to know? Of course! So that I could prepare for it. I want to be the president of the Philippines when I grow up. Why are you laughing? I'm not kidding! You don't believe me, do you? Of course, I do! Because I'm the father of the president of the Philippines. I wish that I would still be alive when my son would be the president of the country. You might make the country rich. Your blood level is high! Go get her medicine! Okay, wait a minute. I'll go get it. Just relax. Wait a minute... Someone wants to give it to you. Who might have given this? Open it while Topher's not here. Oh yes! What do you think this is? What is this? Where's that necklace that I gave you? I kept it. You kept it? Then take it out. I wanna see it. I'll do it later. Show it to me. Show it. You think you can fool me! You liar! You gave it to him, didn't you?! No... no, I didn't... What do you mean no? No, I didn't. Topher's already gone. He's gone? You deserve it! You deserve that! - You think you can fool me?! - That's enough, dad, please! You know that the necklace means a lot to me! - I already told you about it! - Dad, it hurts! Leave! Get out! I don't want to see your face! No! Get out! - Please! Please! - Get out! Until you have the necklace, don't come back here! Leave! I told you to leave! Get out! How dare you! It's because... you're such a flirt... just because... because of a man. You're such a flirt. We will sue you if something happens to my brother! Cheater! You're the cheater! You idiot! You monster! Fuck you all! You came to me! I didn't come to you! Now that you've gotten what you want from me you're complaining because you don't have money! You deserve it! - Fuck you! - Mommy, that's enough! You better leave or I'll call the police! Get out! We're not leaving! You demon! How dare you! Cheater! Witch! - Whatever! - Demon! Doctor, I want to hear it straight. Tell me the truth. Do I have TB? You don't have TB, ma'am, but lung cancer. When will I die? It's already in Stage 2, ma'am. Only the Lord knows when we'll die. Don't worry. Miracles happen everyday. Doc, do you have a cigarette? Star, please don't get emotional on me. You know... me. If you think that I would just sulk and cry, you're wrong. Your mother is a weed. I wouldn't die. I know a lot of my enemies would be happy but fuck them! I will not die. This is just a disease. I can do this. I can do it. The heavens may cry but I wouldn't. For you... Thank you. It's so hot! Grandma... Thanks for the blanket you gave me. It's so cold here at night. Your dad will eventually give in. I know him. He has a soft heart... especially when it comes to you, Byuti. I regret everything, Lola Gloria. I was just waiting for the right timing. I will take the necklace back from him. Lola, do you have change? I need to load up to text Toper. He wants us to meet. You might be fooled again. With what he did to me, I don't think so. Just make sure, Byuti. A lot of good things could still happen to you. I am a flirt. I am a flirt. Direk, are you really going to kill my character? Why? You don't want it? It's just sad that my character's going to die... And I haven't even shown my face yet. Can I make a suggestion? What suggestion? Maybe you can bring back my character and when she's back, my face will be shown! Direk! It's good, isn't it? You're so funny. You know, I think you want to be a script writer. It's better if you go rest. Later, when your scene comes, you'll be drowned. Go! Star, what's wrong? What's happening to you? I don't feel good. You know, you're gaining weight. Are you pregnant? I'll go ahead. You know, Tonic I got this coldness from my mom. I'm pregnant. What? I said that I'm pregnant. Don't ask me who the father is. You'll only laugh. So you're saying goodbye to your dreams... I'm a whore but I can't kill a baby. You know, when I give birth I'll look for a real job. Ah! I know! If my baby's pretty, I'll let her enter showbiz. Think about it. I'll be a stage mother then. I don't wanna do it anymore, sir. I want to live a new life. My conscience is killing me. I love my family. I want to live a new life with them. No one leaves my group alive. I beg you, sir. I will not say anything about you. I'll go far away from here. Thank you, sir. In 24 hours, kill that man. Mama Aissa had a stroke. But... she's okay. She will recover soon. I didn't ask about it and I don't care if she dies. I hope... you forgive me. I didn't want to hurt you. It was my intention to hide from you that's why... I changed my number. Because you found an old fish? I thought you were pure. Whore. I didn't want to use you! I came from a broken family, Byuti. My parents left me alone. They're both abroad now. I don't know where to go. I hope... you understand me. I hope we would still be friends. Fake friends maybe. There's something else that you don't know about me. I'll only admit to you that... I'm gay. It's not obvious, isn't it? I tried to act like a man to live. If you want to taste me, then let's go check in a motel. I'll satisfy you to return the favor. I'm not a lesbian, Toper. And one more thing, if you wanna pay back for the things you've done, give me back my necklace. What? But. But this is your remembrance to me. Then, forget me. Make that blackboard tomorrow. The permit is approved. What are you doing to my husband's grave? It floods in here. I don't want my husband's grave to be miserable. Husband? Am I turning deaf? I'm an educated woman. I don't scoop down to people lower than me. Go on! Continue! What if I bury you alive?! Go and waste your time shouting. I will not fight with you. Donato's dead. Let's not fight over him. My husband's already dead but until now, you're trying to steal him away from me! - How dare you?! - You have lots of issues! Are you that old?! All those 30 years, I never raised my voice at you! Just try and take my husband's body and you'll see! We'll see! My husband came back to me, repented, and died in my arms! So leave us alone! Leave us alone! So leave us alone! Leave us alone! I have friends for the Police. Do you want to ask for help? Never mind. It's dangerous. I can't trust anyone now. I'll send you some money. Give my son a decent burial. Angela... please take care of her. Don-don's body is here. Aren't you going to see him? That's enough. Not too full. Star, I have something to ask you. Popoy said that you have slept with him and that you're noisy in bed. Next... Star, fall in line. No special privileges here. Stupid! What is your problem? What's my problem?! This is my problem! - You idiot! - Ouch! How dare you do that to me! Moron! No one can do that to me! Are your talents complete? Are they fighters? Of course. You? Don't you want a side job? I'm over that stage. What is this? A set-up? What are you doing there? We're busy. I'm returning the necklace. I gave that to you. I only said not to give that to some person! I promise, Naytay. Look at your body You've lost weight. Have you eaten? Go on. Wear that necklace. Why are you doing this?! Ouch! That's enough! Not on my balls! PP-k you! Fuck you! My balls! Ate... I don't care if his penis is in shreds. Even if I didn't have my revenge on him, a lot of people want him. I will not waste my time on him. Fuck him. Yes, okay. Thanks for the news. Okay, thanks. Bye! They might take away our money from the bank. The case is whight slavery. We won't have any savings left. It's okay. What's important is... that you get out of this place. The papers are talking about you! I never knew I'm popular. My career would boost. My past producers would want me back. You can even joke about it. Don't cry. They might think that there's a shooting in here. I just pity you because you're so kind. Thank you for taking care of me, my dear. Even if sometimes, I'm a bit stubborn. Oh mom... Who else would I take care? My father... I'm not even sure who. Mom, aren't you a fortune teller? Why can't you guess who my dad is? I hope... you saw it in your cards... that we would be set-up so that I wouldn't have left that night. My baby... They're taking her away from me. Mom, stay there. They're from Channel 8. - Huh? Where? Where? - I'll just give an interview. Prepare yourself, my dear. Prepare yourself, my dear. Wow, my dear! Your grades are so high! Don't worry, dad. Come college, I'll work really hard to get a scholarship. Are you really going to take Cosmetology? You know, I'll start saving for it now so that you could have your own parlor. Dad, I'm taking Biology, not Cosmetology. I want to be a doctor for you. I don't care if you're a beautician, it's fine with me. Just don't be too stubborn. Dad, if your problem is for my fees, I'll be a working student. And I want you to be proud of me. I'm proud of you even now. I'm glad you've been released. Jake forced me to meet you. My child... please forgive me. I know... I don't deserve to be your father... but I love you so much. I hope... I hope that when you grow up... we'll see each other again. So that I could ask for your forgiveness. This calls for a mass. This is the first time you asked me to go out with you. I wanna tell you something. Why here in Escolta? Why? Are we having flashbacks to the places where you and your father used to go? I'm just looking at Escolta. There's no showbiz in here. None. Only the memories of daddy are left here. Oh! By the way... where do the stuntmen and directors hang-out... so that we could find producers? Before, they're in Tropical in Panay. But then, they were blocked from going there. So, they hang-out anywhere. There's not much work these days. Wait... what did you want to tell me? My cigarette. Mom, could you please not smoke? Just for now. I feel touched. I might get a fever because of that. I have long been concerned. I was just trying to stop it. Could you please stop it? We don't do drama. I might cry because of you. I would like to ask something from you. You know... I like this. When we talk with feelings... when we don't criticize each other. What is this about? Is this about... your miscarriage? That stupidity will never happen again. Mommy, I wanna go away for a while. I don't want to leave but... I have to. To change my life's direction. Where will you go? I will go to the province. I don't know. Anywhere. I need to be alone. So that I could forget everything that happened to me. What about your dreams of being an actress? I've accepted that showbiz isn't for me. Do you have money? Thirty pesos. Okay then. I'll give you some. Can I... hug you? I thought I would be popular because of the scandal. But they criticized me more. I disgust them. Fuck them. Showbizness is too harsh. So... you're back to taking customers? I can't answer your question. But I don't want us to go hungry. And Princess... Here I go again. Fuck life. Fine. Good luck. Good bye. They might... think that we're going together. What about you? I'm starting anew. When I get to the province... I'm changing my screen name. I'll be a different person. So don't worry. I'll make sure to be happy when I arrive. No hugs and sadness. Goodbye. Time to go. Dude, I'm sorry. I have to do this for my son. I'll give it to you. Just don't hurt me please. Dude, thanks. I'm sorry. It was beautifully made. It looks so bright. Don't cry at my burial. Wait It's unlucky to try on a wedding dress. But your burial clothes... Wait You would live longer. What's important is... I've already paid for my service. And that spot beside my husband's grave. Donato and I wouldn't be separated. What if you die and Etang will have Donato's grave dug? I'll rise from the grave. I will haunt her every night. You never get tired, Lucinda. When it comes to money. You're sick but... it seems like you're getting stronger. Fuck, sergeant. People like me... live longer lives. Don't you feel guilty. Sometimes, I have nightmares. You know sergeant, like money can we bring our conscience... to the other side? I thought you texted me that you're just around here. I guessed that I would see you here. This has been your favorite place ever since you were young. Where have you been my dear? Back to being a prostitute. Should I even lie to you? My ass that I have been protecting... is so used. Mom, you know... I'm not hurt when I'm used. I don't feel anything anymore. Let's go home, my dear. It's already morning.
