NARRATOR: In the beginning was the word. And the word was with God. And the word was God. All things were made by Him. And without Him was not anything made that was made. Let there be light. [THUNDER] In him was eternal life. And that light is the light of all mankind. The light shines in the darkness. But that darkness has not comprehended it. Ever since the creation of the world, God's invisible qualities, His eternal power and divine nature, have been seen in all of creation. So there is no excuse. For although mankind knew God, they never worshipped him nor gave Him thanks. -Put your fingers like this. That's better. That's much better. [MUSIC PLAYING] [BABY CRYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] -Do not be afraid. Behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day, in the city of David, a Savior, which is Christ the Lord. -A savior? -And this shall be a sign for you. You shall find the babe wrapped in swaddled clothes lying in a manger. -Come on. [MUSIC PLAYING] -We were told-- -By an angel ---Yes, an angel. He told us that the Savior was born. -And we came to see this Savior. [MUSIC PLAYING] NARRATOR: And the word was with him and dwelt among us. And we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten, the Father, full of grace and truth. [MUSIC PLAYING] JOHN THE BAPTIST: I am the voice of one calling in the wilderness, prepare the way for the Lord. Make his path straight. Every valley shall be filled. And every mountain and hill shall be brought low. And the crooked shall be made straight. And the rough waves shall be made smooth. And all mankind shall see the salvation of God. Repent, for the Kingdom of God is at hand. Even now the axe is laid onto the root of the tree. Therefore, every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire. Repent therefore, and come and be baptized. I may baptize you with water. But there is one coming after me. He is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire. You come to thee. I am the one who needs to be baptized by you. -Please, do this for me. It is important that I fulfill all righteousness. -Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the world. [MUSIC PLAYING] -This is wonderful. It's all for us. [CHATTER] [MUSIC PLAYING] -That's how they're dancing. -Please come. We have no more wine. -Why do you ask me to do this? My time has not come yet. -Please. They'd be disgraced. -How could this happen? I can't believe it. -Oh, Mary I simply don't know what I'm going to do. -It'll be alright. Everything will be alright. -Whatever he tells you to do, you must do it. -Fill those jars with water. -Go, do it. [WHISPERING] -Mary, don't worry. [CHATTER] -Now we must toast the blessed couple. Wine for everyone. -What are you doing here? The guests need more wine. -There isn't any left. -What? That's impossible. Where's the mother? -I don't see what good this water's going to do. There's just no hope. MAN: Lead me to her. I have been told you have a momentary lapse in your supply of wine. You do have more, of course. -I had no idea how much we'd need. We served a great deal already. 20 jars. -You can't be serious. No wedding where I have served as master of ceremonies has ever run out of wine. -But there is wine. [BELL CHIME] -What is this? -Wine? [SNIFFING] -Madam, this is unheard of. This is the best wine I have ever tasted. Most families serve the best wine first, and then when everyone has drunk their fill, bring out the inferior quality. You, madam, have saved the best for last. -Thank God. [LAUGHTER] -Excellent. [LAUGHTER] -The spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor. He has sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord. Today this scripture is fulfilled in your ears. -Do you know what he is saying? -He thinks he's the Messiah. -Ridiculous. -Doesn't he come from Nazareth? -Nothing good comes from Nazareth. [CHATTER] -What do you want from us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? -Be quiet. -I know who you are, Holy one of God. Holy one of God. -Satan. Come out of him. [MUSIC PLAYING] What kind of man is this, that even the evil spirits obey him? [MUSIC PLAYING] -Some of the Pharisees are saying that you use Satan's power to cast out demons. -If Satan drives out Satan, then he is divided against himself. If that happens, how can his kingdom stand. But if I am casting out demons by the Spirit of God, then truly the Kingdom of God has arrived among you. For the Kingdom of God won't be ushered in by visible signs. You won't be able to say, it started here, in this place, or there in that part of the county. For the Spirit of God is within you. But the door to Heaven is narrow. I tell you, many will try to enter, and they will find the door locked. They will stand outside, knocking. But the Lord will reply, I don't know you. [CHATTER] -What are you doing? -Who do you think you are? -Get these out of here. -Look at all the trouble you've caused. -It is written, my house will be a house of prayer. How dare you turn it into a den of robbers. I -Are you going to stop that madman? Elders, what are you waiting for? Arrest him. -Shouldn't we have him arrested? -Yes, yes. The plan must be right. He's won the people over with his miracles. -Well he hasn't won over the merchants. We've all lost money today. MAN (VOICEOVER): For zeal for thine house is consumed and the insults of those who will [INAUDIBLE] have fallen upon you. -Not unless you change, and become like these little children, you will never enter the Kingdom of Heaven. So whoever humbles himself, like this child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of Heaven. Whoever welcomes a child in my name, welcomes me. But if anyone should cause one of these little ones, who believes in me, to stumble, it would be better for him to have a large millstone tied around his neck, and thrown into the deepest sea. WOMAN: Come on, children. Come on. -There was once a very rich man who dressed like a king and lived in a lap of luxury everyday of his life. In the same town, there was also a very poor and sick man named Lazarus, who was covered all over in dreadful sores. His life was so miserable that he longed to have even the crumbs that fell from the rich man's table. And Lazarus had no friends, save the dogs who've came and licked his sores. And time went by, and he finally died. And the angels came, and they carried him straight to Heaven in the bosom of Abraham. The rich man also died. But instead of going to Heaven, he went into Hell. While he was in torment from the fire, but he could look over and he could see Abraham with Lazarus beside him. The rich man called out across the abyss, father Abraham. Have mercy on me. Send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water to cool my tongue, for I am in agony in this fire. Son, remember that in your life on Earth, you had everything your heart could desire. And Lazarus had nothing. Now he is comforted, and you are tormented. And besides, don't you see, there is a huge chasm between Heaven and Hell. No one can go from Heaven to where you are, even if they wanted to. And no one can come here from Hell. But the rich man answered, father, I beg you. Send Lazarus to my father's house. For I have five brothers, and he needs to warn them so they don't end up here in this place of torment. But Abraham told him, they have the written words of Moses and the prophets. That is enough. I know. But they don't believe it. But if someone could come back from the dead, then they would change their ways. Then Abraham said, no, my son. If they don't believe what Moses and the prophets have said, then they won't be convinced even if someone rises from the dead. -I am-- -Nicodemus, welcome. You have waited until night to come to me? -I wanted to speak to you alone. In the city, there are always so many people around. And I-- -People who might not think it wise to be seen me. -Rabbi, we know that you must be a teacher sent from God. No one could perform the miracles you do unless God was with him. -Nicodemus, you need to know this one thing. No one can enter the Kingdom of Heaven unless he is born again. How can someone be born when they are already old? Can anyone go back into the mother's womb and be born a second time? -Nicodemus, I am talking about a spiritual rebirth. Mankind can only reproduce human life. Where it is the Holy Spirit who gives new life from Heaven. You shouldn't be surprised that I talk about being born again. You hear the wind, but you don't know where it comes from or where it's going to. It's the same with the Holy Spirit. You can't see him. But you can feel his power. -I still don't understand what you mean. -You are a respected teacher of the Law of Moses and you don't understand it. You can't see how God can touch your own spirit and make it come alive? It's not by the seeking after knowledge or the doing of good deeds that you enter into His kingdom. It is by faith. If you can't believe the things that happen here in Earth, then how will you ever believe what I tell you about the things that going on where I come from in Heaven? I am the one sent by God. And just as Moses, when he was in the desert, lifted up the bronze image of a serpent on a pole, so must I be lifted up, that I may draw all man unto myself. Nicodemus, God sent his only Son, that who believes in Him will not perish but have everlasting life. God didn't send his Son into the world to condemn it, but to save it. [MUSIC PLAYING] [CHATTER] -When do you think he'll join us? -He said he'd meet us at Capernaum. [MUSIC PLAYING] [THUNDER] -We've got to make sure. -Bail. Bail. Bail. Bail. Bail. Bail. -Come here. -What? -Peter, I'm here. Don't be afraid. -Lord, if it's really you, make me come to you on the water. -Then come. -Don't do that. -Are you crazy? -Lord, save me. Lord, save me. -Simon, why did you doubt me? -Surely you are the Son of God. [MUSIC PLAYING] [LAUGHTER AND CHATTER] -Remember that I told you I must suffer many things. I must be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and teachers of the law and must be killed. But on the third day, I will be raised back to life. -He's to be killed? I don't believe it. -Oh Jerusalem. Jerusalem, city that kills the prophets and stones all those that God has sent you. How often I have wanted to gather your children together like a hen that gathers her chicks beneath her wings to protect them. But you wouldn't let me. And now your house has to stand desolate. [MUSIC PLAYING] [CHATTER] -We should have arrested him before, but look how the whole world has gone over to him. -It will be very dangerous. -He must be stopped. [CLAPPING] -Out of the way. Get out of my way. Get out of the way. And tell your disciples to silence these people. This is blasphemy. -If I tell them to be quiet, then the very stones of the city would cry out, hosanna. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. [CHEERING] -Do you hear what these children are saying? -Yes. And have you never read, from the lips of babes, you have perfected praise. [CHEERING] ALL: Hosanna. Hosanna. Hosanna. Hosanna. Hosanna. Hosanna. Hosanna. Things can't go on like this. The Romans will take away our positions as high priests and it will destroy our nation as well. -Too many of the people think he is our savior. -Do you know nothing. Don't you realize it will be better for one man to die for the people then for our whole nation to perish? -I'll order his arrest. [CHATTER] [MUSIC PLAYING] -The one I greet with a kiss will be the man. Arrest him. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Greetings, rabbi. Judas, you betrayed me with a kiss. -That's our man. -No, Peter. Those who live by the sword will also die by the sword. Don't you realize, I could ask my Father in Heaven to send thousands of angels to defend us, and they would instantly be at my command. Let me see that. Am I a terrorist, that you had to arm yourselves with swords and clubs to arrest me? I was with you everyday, teaching at the temple. Why didn't you take me then? But this is all happening so that the scriptures will be fulfilled. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Where are all his miracles now? -Yes. Why doesn't this, um, Savior come down from the cross? And then we'll believe he is the King of Israel. [LAUGHTER] -You are the King of the Jews. Why don't you rescue yourself? Huh? [LAUGHTER] Where is your mighty army? MAN ON CROSS: Aren't you the savior? Why don't you save yourself and us? -You're about to die, and you still don't fear God. We deserve our punishment, but this man is innocent. Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom. -I promise you that today, you will be with me in paradise. [LAUGHTER] [CHATTER] -It's my turn to win, yes. -It's mine. MAN: Poured out like water. And my bones are out of joint. My heart is like wax. The assembly of the wicked have encircled me. They pierce my hands and my feet. I can count all my bones. They stare and gloat over me. They part my garments among them and cast lots for my clothing. -Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani. Father, into your hands, I commit my spirit. -No. -It is finished. [THUNDER] [CRYING] [YELLING] [CRYING] -Surely, this was the Son of God. [MUSIC PLAYING] [CHATTER] [RUMBLING] -Earthquake. -Do not be afraid. I know you have come looking for Jesus, who was crucified. He's not here. He has risen just as he said he would. Come, and see inside his tomb. -Where is he? -He's alive. Go and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead. -Let's go. Hurry. It's true. This is wonderful. Do you really believe he's alive. -I do. JESUS: Mary. -Master. -Don't be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee. And I will meet them there. -Remember that when I was with you, I told you everything that Moses and the prophets said about me must be accomplished? Long ago it was written, that the Savior must suffer, die, and rise from the dead on the third day. And you are to carry this message to all the people on the Earth. There is forgiveness of sins to all who turn to me in repentance. -Lord, are you going to free Israel now make it your kingdom? -The Father has set those times and dates. It isn't for you to know them now. But you will receive great power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. And you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, throughout Israel and Samaria, and even to the ends of the Earth. Heal the sick. Raise the dead. Cleanse those who have leprosy. Drive out demons. Freely you have received. Freely give. Remember that I am with you always, even until the end of the world. [MUSIC PLAYING] ANGEL: Men of Galilee, why are you still standing here staring into the sky? Jesus has been taken into Heaven, but someday, just as you saw him leave, he will return. [CHATTER] NARRATOR: Jesus' disciples saw him do many miracles. And these were recorded so that you may believe that he is the savior, the Son of the living God. And that by believing in Him, you will have eternal life. [CHATTER] The word that was in the beginning is near you. It is in your mouth and in your heart. But if you confess with your mouth, Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. NARRATOR: The people walking in darkness have seen a great light. Upon those living in the land of the shadow of death, a light has dawned. [SINGING] Now there was a man in Jerusalem, called Simeon, who was righteous and devout. He was waiting for the conciliation of Israel. And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die until we had seen the Lord's Christ. [BABY CRYING] [CHATTER] -What is the child's name? -Jesus. -The first born of every womb belongs to the Lord. -Oh, Lord. Now let thy servant depart in peace according to thy word. For mine eyes have seen thy salvation, who thou has prepared in the presence of all people, a light of revelation to the Gentiles, and to glory to thy people Israel. [BABY CRYING] I give you both my blessing, and I praise God, I have lived to see this day. Behold, this child is sent for the fall and rising of many in Israel. And for a sign, which shall be spoken against, that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed. And the sword will pierce your own heart too, my daughter. [MUSIC PLAYING] NARRATOR: Very little is recorded of Jesus' early life. We do know that he grew up Nazareth, the son of a carpenter. He became a man of wisdom, finding favor with both God and man. After he was baptized in the Jordan by John, he was led by the Holy Spirit into the wilderness. [LAUGHTER] SATAN: You must be hungry. If you really are the Son of God, why don't you turn these stones into bread? -It is written, man does not live on bread alone, but upon every word that proceeds from the mouth of God. [LAUGHTER] [THUNDEROUS BOOM] [LAUGHTER] SATAN: If you are are the Son of God, why don't you throw yourself down there? For isn't it written, he will give his angels charge over you? And in their hands, they will lift you up, lest you strike your foot against the stone. -But it is also written, you shall not tempt the Lord thy God. SATAN: All the kingdoms of the Earth, with all the wealth and glory, are mine to give. All these things I will give you if you will fall down and worship me. -Be gone, Satan. For it is written, you shall worship the Lord thy God, and him only shall you serve. NARRATOR: Jesus returned to the Galilee in power of the Spirit. And the news about him spread throughout the countryside. [CHATTER] -He's a leper. -Move back. -Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean. -I am. Be clean. [MUSIC PLAYING] [LAUGHTER] -I am healed. I am healed. Look at me. I am clean. I am clean. I am clean. I am healed. I am healed. I am healed. I am healed. I am healed. I still can't believe it. I am healed. [HORSES RUNNING] -Lord, I know that you have the power to heal. My servant lies at home, paralyzed, in terrible pain. -Take me to him. -No, my Lord. I don't deserve to have you come under my roof, but just, just say the word and my servant will be healed. For I, myself am a man under authority, my Lord, with soldiers under me. If I tell this one, go, he goes. If I tell that one, come, he comes. If I say to my servant, do this, he does it. -Well I tell you the truth, I have not found anyone in all of Israel with faith as great as this man's. Go. It will be done just as you believed it would. [HORSES RUNNING] -Look, sir. Look at me. It's a miracle. It's a miracle. -I knew it would be so. Oh, God. Be praised. Ah, ah, ah. [MAN SCREAMING] -Oh, I've heard of this man. He lives in this tomb. People of the town are always trying to chain him up to keep him from hurting himself, but it does no good. -Satan. -Jesus. Why are you troubling us? Jesus, Son the the Most High God. Swear. Swear to God. Swear to God that you won't torment me. Swear to God. Swear to God. Swear to God. Swear to God. -What is your name? -My name is Legion. [LAUGHTER] For we are many. [LAUGHTER] You don't make us go away. Don't make us go away. Don't make us go away. Don't let us into the abyss. [PIGS SNORTING] Pigs. Haha. Ha. Please at least you can send us into those pigs. Send us into those pigs. -Very well. Go. [MOANING] [PIGS SQUEALING] -Oh, you're out. I got you. I got you. Oh, you're out. If I got you, out. If I got you, you're out. If I got you-- Got you, ah. -Rabbi. Rabbi. My little girl is dying. Come and put your hands on her, so she will be healed and live. Please, come. Please. She's going to die. Please. -Of course. Who touched me? -But Lord, look at all these people. How come you ask, who touched me? -I felt power go out from me. -Lord, forgive me. For 12 years, I've been suffering with this issue of blood. I've spend all my money on doctors, but they only made me worse. Please. I thought if I could touch the hem of your garment, I'd be healed. -Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace. You are free from your suffering. MAN: Jairus, it's too late. -No, no. No, no. It can't be. Jesus was coming to heal her. -There's no need to bother him now. I can't believe it. How could my little one be gone? -Don't be afraid. Just believe. Jarius. Jarius. -Yes? -Take me to your daughter. -Come. [CRYING] -I can't. I can't. -Please. Please. Let me see her. Please. -OK. Talitha koum. Little girl, arise. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Come on. Hey, hey. [CHATTER] [COINS CLINKING] -Come on. Thank you. Please, please. -Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents that he was born blind? -Neither this man nor his parents have sinned. -What do you want? Now leave me alone please. Leave me alone. Don't touch me. Get away. Please. Don't touch me. Please. No, please. No, no. Please don't touch me. -Close your eyes. But this happened so that the glory of God might be revealed. Shhh, shh, shh, shh. Shh. Shh. Now go wash your eyes in a pool of Siloam. Go. Go. Go. -I can see. I can see. Look at me. Look at me. I can see. -Isn't he the blind man who used to beg on the side of the valley gate? MAN: No, it can't be. He only looks like him. -That man healed me. Look at me. That man healed me. I can see. I can see. You'd better let Kiabus this know about this. -So, this man made some mud and put it on your eyes. -Yeah, that's what I said. -Now isn't today the Sabbath? -Of, of, of course it is. But what does that got to do with it? -Because if this man was from God, he'd keep the Sabbath. -But how can a sinner do such miracles? -We don't know that he has done any miracles. -Here are his parents. Ask them. -Is this man your son? -He, well, he's a-- -Of course he's our son. And he's been blind from the day he was born. How we can see now and who opened his eyes, we don't know. Ask him. He's of age now. He can speak for himself. -Give glory to God for your healing. -We know this Jesus is a sinner. -Whether he's a sinner or not, I don't know. But there is one thing I do know. I was blind and now I can see. -We don't even know where he comes from. -That's remarkable. You say you don't know where the man comes from. Nobody has ever heard of somebody opening the eyes of a man born blind. If the man weren't from God, he could do nothing. -You were steeped in sin at birth. -How dare you lecture us. Throw him out. -Come on. -This way, this way. It's right here. Everything will be all right. Jesus will answer all your questions. -We'll see. [CLAPPING] -Master, tell us another story. There was a man who had two sons. The younger son said to his father, father, give me my share of the inheritance. So the father divided his property between them. Not long after, the youngest son set off for a far country. And there squandered his wealth on wild living. Then there was a severe famine in that whole land. And he had no money. So he hired himself out to a farmer, who sent him into his fields to feed the pigs. The son longed to fill his stomach with even the pawns the pigs were eating. But no one gave him anything. Finally he came to his senses and said to himself, how many of my father's hired men have food to spare? And here I am starving to death. I'll go back to my father. Maybe he will let me be one of his hired servants. So the boy got up, and went to his father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him, and was filled with compassion for him. He ran to his son, threw his arms around him, and kissed him. Mwah. Father, said the son, I have sinned against Heaven and you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son. The father said to his servant, quick, bring the best robe and put on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. Bring the fatted calf and kill it. Let's have a feast and celebrate. For his son of mine was dead, but is alive again. He was lost. But now he is found. -Why does your teacher eat with tax collector and sinners? -It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. But you should learn what this means. For I desire mercy, not sacrifice. I have not come to call the righteous, but the sinners to repentance. -Teacher, we know that you're a man of integrity, and that you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. So tell us then, is to right to pay taxes to Caesar or Not -You hypocrites. Why you try to trap me? So me the coin used for paying the tax. Whose portrait is this, and whose inscription is written upon it? ALL: Caesars. -Then render unto Caesar what is Caesar's and unto God what is God's. -Master. Oh, master. Master. Mary and Martha, they send me to tell you that their brother, Lazarus, is sick and dying. -Tell them I'll be there in three days. -But master, he won't survive for three days. He was near death when I, when I left him yesterday. -The sickness will not end in death. It is for God's glory so that His Son may be glorified. Please go. Please. Go, please, go. Tell them. The teachers of the law and Pharisees sit in Moses' seat, so you must obey them and do everything they tell you. But do not do as they do. For they do not practice what they preach. You tie up heavy loads of and put them on men's shoulders. But they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to help move them. MAN: Yes. Yes. -Woe to you teachers of the law and Pharisees. You hypocrites. You shut the kingdom of Heaven in men's faces. You travel overland and sea to win a single convert then you make them twice as much a son of hell as you are. Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees. -You give a tenth of your goods, but you neglect the more important aspects of the law, justice, mercy, and faithfulness. You blind guides. You strain out a gnat and swallow a camel. You are like whitewashed tombs. You look beautiful on the outside, but on the inside they are full of dead man's bones. You snakes. You brutal vipers. -He must be silenced. -How will you escape being condemned to Hell? [CRYING] -Lord, if you'd been here, my brother would not have died. But I know that even now, God will give you whatever you ask. -Your brother will rise again. -Yes, I know he will rise, on the last day. -I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me though dies, yet shall live. Do you believe this? -Yes, I believe. I believe you are the Christ, the Son of God who is coming into this world. -Oh, Lord. If only you had been here, Lazarus would still be alive, alive. [CRYING] -Take away the stone. -But Lord, by this time there will be an odor. For he has been dead for four days. -Didn't I tell you that if you believed, you would see the glory of God. Lazarus! Come forth! -Oh Oh my God. [MUSIC PLAYING] [CHATTER] -I have been longing to eat this passover with you. -And we, we you. -Because I will not eat it again until all is fulfilled in the Kingdom of God. But I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me. -What is he saying? -Lord, who is it? -He's here, eating with me. The one who will dip his hand in the bowl with me, he will betray me. Everything must happen just as it is written. But woe to the man who betrays him. It would be better for him if he had never been born. -Surely not I, Rabbi. [WHISPERING] -What you're about to do, do it quickly. MAN: Judas? Judas. [WHISPERING] -A new command I give you, love one another, as I loved you. You must love one another, and by this, all men will know that you are my disciples if you love one another. This is my body, given for you, do this in remembrance of me. This is my blood of the new covenant, poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. Drink from it, all of you. NARRATOR: When Jesus finished, he went to the Mount of Olives to pray. Judas knew the place and led a detachment of soldiers to arrest him. -The one I greet with a kiss will be the man. Greetings, Rabbi. -Judas, you betray me with a kiss. -Come. [CHATTER] -Quiet. Quiet. Be quiet. What is this testimony these men have given against you? Aren't you going to answer these accusations? ALL: Answer. -I charge in the name of the living God, are you the Christ, the Son of God? -I am. -Blasphemy. -Blasphemer! Blasphemer! You have heard him blaspheme. What do you say? ALL: Stone him. Kill him. Stone him. [SHOUTING] -What are these charges against you? These chargers? Where are they? Oh, so you refuse to answer me? Don't you realize that I have the power to free you or to crucify you? -You would have no power over me if it were not given to you from above. -Are you the King of the Jews? -Do you believe this? Or is this what people say about me? -Are you? It's your own people, your chief priests have handed you over to me. Now, are you the King of the Jews? -My kingdom is not of this world. -Then you are a king. -You're right in saying that I am a king. For this reason, I was born. And for this cause, I came into the world. But I should bear witness to the truth. Anyone who understands the truth hears my voice. -What is truth? Flog him. Perhaps that'll knock some sense in his head and satisfy the Jews. -Oh no, Pontius. -My wife, what is it? -No you, you mustn't have anything to do with that man. Did you see that man is innocent? Remember, remember when I was sick and near death? He's the one who healed me. Pontius I've hardly slept. I had such terrible dreams about him. Please. You must let him go. -His own people have determined to silence him. But leave everything to me. Calm yourself. Everything will be all right. [WHIPPING] JESUS: Ah! -Everything will be all right. JESUS: Ah! [WHIPPING] [CHATTER] -Bring him in. -Lord, King of the Jews. -Behold, the man. [SCREAMING IN PAIN] -I find no fault in him. I know it is your custom for me to release one prisoner to you at the time of the Passover. You want me to release Jesus, the King of the Jews? ALL: No. -No. Give us Barabbas. ALL: Barabbas. Barabbas. Barabbas. [YELLING] -What shall I do then with Jesus, who they call the Christ? -Crucify him. ALL: Crucify him. Crucify him. Crucify him. Crucify him. Crucify him. Crucify him. Crucify him. Crucify him. Crucify him. Crucify him. -Very well then. I am innocent of this man's blood. It's on your heads. ALL: Crucify him. Crucify him. Crucify him. Crucify him. Crucify him. Crucify. Crucify. Crucify. Crucify. Crucify. Crucify. Crucify. Crucify. Crucify. [YELLING] NARRATOR: It was the third hour when they crucified Jesus. And with him, they also crucified two thieves, one on his right and one on his left. As it is written, "and he was numbered with the transgressors." From the sixth until the ninth hour, a darkness fell over the whole land. -It is finished. [THUNDER] [SCREAMING] -Surely, this was the Son of God. -Your Excellency, the high priest is here to see you. -What now? Hm? Another king you want eliminated? -Sir, we remember what that impostor Jesus said while he was alive. He said, after three days I will rise again. Now we, we beg you to order guards to be placed at his tomb, or his disciples might go and steal his body. And then they will tell everyone that he has risen from the grave. -And the last fort would be worse than the first. -Very well. Take a patrol and make it secure. NARRATOR: Early on the first day of the week, there was a violent earthquake and an angel of the Lord came and rolled away the stone at the tomb. Jesus the Christ had risen just as he said. -Hurry. Let me see. Where is he? -He's alive. I tell you Thomas, we saw him. -I don't-- -Believe it. -It's true. I was there. -Listen, unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were, I won't believe it. -Peace be with you Don't be frightened, Thomas. It's only me. See my hands? And my feet? Put your finger here. -My Lord, and my God. -Because you have seen you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen and yet believe. Remember that when I was with you, I told you everything that Moses and the prophets said about me must be accomplished? Long ago it was written that the Savior must suffer, die, and rise from the dead on the third day. And you are to carry this message to all the people on the Earth. There is forgiveness of sins to all who turn to me in repentance. And you will be my witnesses. And I am with you always, even until the end of the world. ANGEL: Men of Galilee, why are you still standing here, staring into the sky? Jesus has been taken into Heaven. But someday, just as you saw him leave, he will return. NARRATOR: Jesus' disciples saw him do many more miracles. But these were recorded so that you may believe that he is the savior, the Son of the living God, and that by believing in Him, you will have eternal life. The word that was in the beginning is near you. It is in your mouth and in your heart. But if you confess with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord' and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. [MUSIC PLAYING]
