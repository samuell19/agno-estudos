Take your tastebuds on a trip to Maplewood this Christmas... Where something delicious is in store. This holiday season, open up a box of Grandma Cooper's famous Christmas cookies. Made right here in Grandma's home town with her classic secret recipe. Every bite will make you ask... What's in that cookie? I'll never tell. Bring home a box of Cooper's today and see your children's faces shine. And your grandchildren, too. Mmm, that's a good cookie! After all, it's not Christmas without Coopers. That's me. Little Annie Cooper. Now I know what you're thinking. The world has changed a lot since Grandma opened Cooper's Cookies 40 years ago. But this Christmas, there's one thing you can count on being the same. That's because Grandma's secret recipe still tastes just how you remember it. Mmm, now that is a good cookie. And cut! Alright, thank you. How was it? It was great! You were glowing. But did it work? Was it too, "Look at me, I'm the new CEO." Oh gosh, no! Uh-uh. It was the perfect blend of nostalgia and modernism. Like a Picasso. Oversold it? Yeah, just a little bit. Okay. Um, okay. Great job, everyone! Doors open in 20 minutes! Ooh! We have cookies to sell. Thank you. Parker. Parker. What time do the caterers get in? 5:00! 5:00. Excellent. We need to make sure everything is perfect. The entire board's gonna be here tonight. Um, is that today's paper? Yes, but I don't think you really want to... Is it worse than last week? Give it to me. Oh boy. Ah... "The End of Coopers as we know it. The new CEO has wasted no time leaving her mark, or should we say stain, on Cooper's Cookies and this town as a whole. A New York outsider, groomed in the corporate world of Manhattan, Annie Cooper has slashed funding for many Maplewood institutions and programs which, under her grandmother, were beloved by all." You know what, the media is so biased these days. Wait till they hear that we cancelled the Cooper Light Up. Sorry, did you say cancelled? Yeah, it's too expensive. I ran it by the board. Oh, that's... that's good. Yes. Speaking of the board, I need to... Hey, hey... - Yo, yo... - Miss C, Miss C... We just had you know, a quick Q about the Christmas party tonight? Yeah, a semi-formal? Is that like, hang loose on the bottom, suit and tie up-top? Yeah, right. Or is it like go wild up top, keep it business down low? Yeah, under no circumstances should you go loose on the bottom or go wild on top. Just ah, keep it classy. Head to toe. Excuse me. We need to go shopping. Miriam! Yes, Annie. What can I do for you? I did not get your feedback after the last board meeting. Did you need it? You seemed quite confident in your performance as I recall. Well, you do know the position that Cooper's is facing, and since I've been here, I've identified many areas where we can reduce expenses, increase profits, and ultimately take Cooper's to the next level. And how long have you been here, Annie? Five months. Five months. Not even half a year since your grandmother's estate gifted you leadership of this company. You have very large shoes to fill, Miss Cooper. And make no mistake, if you so much as stumble, I will not hesitate to replace you. I'll be in my office, if you need me. Oh. Okay. Thank you. Merry Christmas. Hi! Hi. Look at that. You got a good one this year. Even bigger than last year. How does your dad feel about it? Ohh. He feels like he should ask Santa for a new spine this Christmas. You know feel free to lend a hand? I... I would, Sam, but I'm on lunch. That's a really balanced meal you got going on there. It's funny, that's what my cardiologist said. If I knew grandma's secret recipe, I would save a fortune on these things. Yeah, now that I believe. Yeah. Speaking of, you met the new boss? Saw her from a distance when I did a job at the factory last week. But, you guys wanna hear a rumor? Alright. Apparently, she's on one of those low-carbonated diets. She won't even touch a cookie. Ah, that's low carbohydrate, Frank, and I'm pretty sure you started that rumor. Yeah, but it could be true. We don't know. Alright, I'll see you later. Alright, come on, your turn. You're funny, dad. Wait, I wasn't jo... I wasn't joking. Oh man! Ah! You okay? Huh? Me? Oh yes. I... I'm fine. Are you sure? 'Cause you looked kind of green. Like mistletoe green. I... I'm fine. Um, I heard they were giving away some free samples over at Cooper's. Really? Um, I don't think so. My dad's not a big fan of Cooper's anymore. Why is that? He said the new boss is just a Grinch wannabe. I've heard worse. And that she should go back to her smelly cave at the top of Mount Crumpit. He's right over there if you wanna go meet him. Um, no. No, I think that's... That's okay. But um, I hope you will give Cooper's a chance, even if your dad won't. And I also hope you have a very merry Christmas. You too. Homeward bound, Miss Annie? No, Arthur, I have one more stop I need to make first. Alright. And from a net profit stand point, with the cuts we've made, the outlook of Cooper's going into the New Year is very positive. So, that's this week's update. You know, Rose loved financial reports as much as the next person. But perhaps she'd like an update on her granddaughter's personal life. Personal life, huh? What personal life? I only ever came to Maplewood to visit grandma. All my friends are in New York and Cooper's is all I have here. What am I? The ghost of Christmas past? Of course, I have you, Arthur. I just hope grandma knows her legacy is in good hands. Hmm. Working at Cooper's? Living in Maplewood? Your grandmother loved it. Her life was full of joy. And I know she wanted that for you as well. Joy, huh? Will you tell me what could be more joyful than a successful quarter? Are you coming to our Christmas party tonight? I don't think so, my dear. Now Rose managed to drag me out now and then, but uh, I'm a homebody at heart. She was so lucky to have a friend like you. Don't worry, Rose, she'll find her way in the end. Showtime. Hi. Merry Christmas. Oh yes, please. Thank you. I'm starving. Oh! That is very fishy, ooh. Richard, hi! Hey Jillian, hi. Here, have an hor d' oeuvre. Thanks. Enjoy, it's delicious. Thank you. Oh no, thank you. Oh well, they look pleased. If only all the shareholders felt that way, right? Do people seem bored to you? Ah... Bored? No! Everyone is having a blast. Jillian... Okay, so just warn me before Miriam gets here, because I'm gonna need a chance to hide. Oh, she's not coming. She wasn't feeling well apparently. That's amazing! I mean, not that she's not feeling well, obviously I hope that she's gonna be okay. Right. But now I can actually relax. Let's relax! Relax. Hi, I would love a dry martini with three olives, please. And? I'll do the same. Hey, Miss C... Yo! Miss C, check it out! Oh wow, that is classy. Good job, guys. Yes! Thank you. Thank you. Chin-chin. Chin-chin. Mmm, that is so good. Oh yeah, um... so excellent. Mm. So, are you giving a speech tonight? Oh no. No, no, I'm not really a public speaking kind of gal. Oh. What? Nothing. I was... It's just grandma gives a speech every year, so I think people might be expecting it. Oh well, so much for being able to relax. Oh. Wish me luck. Good luck. So ah... Yeah, I'll have an eggnog on the rocks. Two candy canes please. Is everyone having fun tonight? - Yeah! - Wooo! Well, merry Christmas and thank you all so much for being here. Now, I know if my grandma were standing up here right now, she would probably start out with one of her classic jokes. Like... what do snowmen eat for Christmas? Frosted flakes. That's right! And by a show of hands, how many people in this room have fallen victim to one of grandma's practical jokes? Oh yeah. - Me for sure. - I thought so. You know one year, grandma actually gift-wrapped my entire dorm room for Christmas. Now I know I may seem like a stranger to a lot of you in this room, but the truth is, we all share something in common. And that's that, I miss my grandma, too. And I'm not gonna stand up here and pretend that I can replace the woman we all loved, or even remotely fill her shoes, as they say. But I made a promise to myself and I made a promise to my grandma, that I would do everything in my power to make sure that Cooper survives. And I believe that with your help, Cooper's has a very bright future indeed. Because after all, it's not Christmas without Cooper's. Ooh! Merry Christmas, everyone! Accounting got back to me... Finally! They'll have the budget ready for Friday. Reschedule for Wednesday. Okay. You have a 2:00 meeting with Seattle. Reschedule for Monday. Oh, okay. Are you gonna need a car this weekend? Still thinking about it. Oh no. Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Where is it? Where is it? What happened? Someone stole grandma's secret recipe. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh! What are you doing? Calling the police. No! No, no, no, no, no. No one can know the recipe is missing. This could be the end of Cooper's. What do we do? Well, the factory uses a digital copy to make the cookies. So, how do we access that? IT. IT! Okay, let's go to IT. Okay, where... Oh, wait. What is this? I don't know. Let's go. Where's IT? Just up the stairs. - Go to your right. - Okay. Um, can I just um, have that... That phone back? She's dead, isn't she? As a door nail. I told you, you pushed her too hard. Well, how was I supposed to know? Honestly, I'm surprised she lasted as long as she did. Oven this old belongs in a museum. Cookie? Ooh, don't mind if I do? She always held her temperature, and she baked every batch evenly. Mm-hmm. It'll be missed. Oh! That's a real tragedy. Did he kill her? Guilty as charged. Hey, it wasn't my fault! Alright, and that is yours. Seriously, Frank? You're a repairman. You didn't repair anything. Time is money, my friend. I know. Cookies aren't free either. Alright. Too salty anyway. Yeah, just like you. Merry Christmas. It's our busiest time of year, Sam. We're not gonna keep up with just one oven. Yeah, well, we have to. Because I can't afford to buy a new one right now. ♪ Singing the old carols by candlelight ♪ ♪ Roasting chestnuts on the open fire ♪ ♪ Every little thing with you just feels right ♪ ♪ So right ♪ ♪ 'Cause Santa always comes at night ♪ ♪ I've been waiting on these ♪ ♪ Since last New Year's Eve ♪ ♪ 'Cause Santa always comes at night ♪ ♪ Santa always comes at night ♪ Ah! Are you done? What? Oh. So sorry. Yes, ma'am. What's your name? Calvin. Calvin Brar. Well, Calvin Brar, we need your help. Okay. It's gone. Somebody got through my security. It's all... it's all gone. Oh man. Oh man. This is really bad, Annie. So bad. I've handled worse. Stock market crashes, hostile takeovers. I'm gonna lose my job. So, what's the plan? I move back in with my parents again. Cookie production is shut down for the holidays. I'm hot, are you... Are you guys hot? Which means we have until Christmas to catch whoever stole our recipe and get it back. Santa's not coming this year, kids! - Calvin! - Calvin! Sorry. I think the thief may have dropped this by accident. "Bella's Bakery. Buy six dozen cookies and get a dozen free." I love that place. They have the best cookies in the whole... Second best cookies in the whole world. Well, whoever dropped this must go there a lot. Then that is where we start. Start what? Bella's Bakery. There it is. This is the place. Might I recommend you try the Sugar Plum Snaps? They are delightful. Not you too, Arthur. Well, it's not a crime to enjoy other cookies. No. But it should be. Just wanted the double chocolate? Alright. Can I help you with something? No. No, thank you. You sure about that? Actually um, have you noticed anyone suspicious in here lately? Someone acting a little odd perhaps? You know, now that you mention it, yeah. - Really? - Mm-hmm. And what did they look like? Female. Brown hair. Hazel eyes. And how tall? About 5'9-ish. Definitely, 5' 9", okay. Mm-hmm And... and what was she wearing? A very uncomfortable-looking business suit, a purple sweater, and gas station sunglasses. Okay, first of all, this is aubergine. Second of all, gas station, as if. And third of all, do you think this is some kind of joke? I'm not laughing. If I've offended you somehow... I just don't appreciate my competition coming in here, snooping around, and bothering my customers. Oh, I don't think of you as competition. Good to know. Excuse me? Hey, you're not supposed to go back there! Oh! Well, you obviously know who I am. Huh, make yourself at home. Everybody knows who Little Annie Cooper is. Just Annie would be fine, thank you. And you are? Excuse me, Sam Hobbs. Well, Sam Hobbs, one of your regulars committed a crime against my company and I'm here to find out who. A crime? What crime? Well, hello, it's you again. I hate to break it to you, but none of my regulars are criminals. And how can you be so sure? Unless where were you last night between 6:00 p.m. and midnight? Ah, let me see, none of your business. He was with me. Bella... You've got an alibi, dad. Dad? Ha. So you're the one who's not a big fan of Cooper's. I believe that's what they call “a motive”. Cool. Really, Bella? Oh. Except he really was with me. I had a dance rehearsal. Can someone verify that? Okay, I think it's time for you to leave. Hmm, can't take the heat. I will get out of your kitchen. For someone who claims to be innocent, you sure are defensive. And what exactly is this crime that you're accusing me of? I can't tell you. Look, I'm... I'm sorry for whatever it is that happened at Cooper's, but if a crime really was committed you should just call the cops. You offered me a cookie, so... Thank you. Okay, Bella, come on. I'd better go. Bye. No, Jillian. It was a complete disaster. I accused the owner of theft, I got kicked out of the bakery. I think that at least qualifies as a minor catastrophe. Hang on, let me call you right back. Arthur. Hey, is everything okay? Oh yes, quite alright. But I saw that you forgot something in the back seat. Thank you. Enjoy. Hey, you worked for grandma longer than anyone. Did she ever tell you her secret recipe? No, Miss Annie. And I did not think it my place to ask. Of course, the ingredients are all listed on the box. Right. But it would take a highly skilled baker to figure out the right combination. Goodnight. Goodnight. Mmm. But I don't get it. Why an orange? I don't know. But Santa put one in my stocking every year. Maybe he ran out of coal. How dare you! - Hi. - Hi. Hi. I came to apologize. 30 seconds, that's all I ask. Ohhh... Wow. Oh, thank you. It's so much warmer in here. Okay, you have 30 seconds. Well, I didn't literally mean 30 seconds. Okay, okay. Yesterday, I may have been a d... Teeny tiny bit out of line. Was that your apology? Yes. And I really mean it. Unbelievable. What did you expect me to do? You want me to fall down on my knees? Oh, look at that, time's up. Well, what about you? What about me? Yesterday, I think you were quite rude. You accused me of a crime! You were a likely suspect. You're not a detective. Someone stole my grandma's secret recipe. Wait, are you serious? And we found this at the crime scene. So, we think whoever did it must spend a lot of time here. Okay, well, I'm telling you that I didn't do it. I know you didn't do it. And I'm sorry I accused you like that. Well, thank you. And I'm sorry that your grandmother's recipe got stolen. I wish I could help. You actually can. That... that is why I'm here. And I thought you came to apologize. Yeah well, I came for that, too. Look, everyone keeps telling me how great your cookies are. And they're right. See, I've now tried one. This cookie was good. It's really, really good. Hmm, well, thank you. Almost as good as my grandma's. There it is. But I've never said that about another cookie before. Ever. Look, is this going somewhere? I... I'm... I'm asking you if you would help me figure out my grandma's secret recipe before anyone realizes it's missing. Is this a joke? Do I look like I'm laughing? Let me get this straight. Yesterday you accused me of a theft and today you want me to help save your company? Yes. No thanks. Okay. I will do whatever it takes. Nope. Money! I can pay you. Well, we don't need your money. Yes, you do. See? Everyone needs money. Well, I don't. It's supposed to do that. I'll buy you a new oven. We'll do it. No, we won't. We definitely will. We're not doing it, okay. We don't need your money. That's final, we're out. I'm sorry. Um, what were you saying? One more on the roof. Hmm, one more. Morning, you two. Hey. And the candy-cane mailbox. Look at that. Good morning. I thought parents weren't allowed to help with the school competition? What do you mean competition? Bella, you said this was for a bake sale. Thanks, dad. I think I've got a real shot tomorrow. We're gonna talk when you... We're gonna talk when she gets home. So, I heard you made a deal with Annie Cooper yesterday? Oh, that's who that was. 'Cause I kind of feel like I sold my soul. Oh, don't be so dramatic. I knew her as a girl, you know. Mm-hmm. She and her parents would spend every Christmas in Maplewood. And she was the sweetest little thing. Well, if there's any sweetness left in there, I haven't seen it. Oh, give it some time. Oh, I'm gonna need a bigger watch. Okay, team, so let's set up right over here. This will be our base of operations for now. Ah. What's going on? Oh, Jillian, this is Sam. Hi. I didn't realize you'd be moving in and contaminating my sterile workspace. Well, I'm not gonna put all my eggs in one basket. And we still have to catch this thief, and working out of Cooper's, it's gonna draw too much attention. Hey, Miss Cooper, did you just want this in the trash? Why's he touching my sign? Well, I'm helping you. It's amateur marketing. The best things in the world don't have to tell you they're the best. They just speak for themselves. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. Hey, could I grab a peppermint latte? Nope. Oh, I wouldn't. Sam likes to be alone. Oh, I got this. Sam? Sam? Okay, team, what do we have so far? Timelines? List of suspects? Clues? This case isn't gonna solve itself. Ah, well, we had a clue but it turned out to be dead end. And we don't really know where to go from here. Then it's a good thing you came to me. We didn't, actually. Motive and means, the two most important things any good detective looks for when solving a case. The Mistletoe Mysteries! I used to love these. Have you read the case of the Caroling Cadavers? I'm almost done. Calvin. Sorry. Yeah. Well, I don't know about motive, but they definitely had means. I mean whoever did this, knew exactly how to get in undetected, erase the security footage, and access my system all without triggering an alarm. But how is that possible? I thought you were in charge. You do know we're on a tight deadline, right? You're ruining my happy place. Christmas is only 10 days away. 12, actually. Bella announces it every morning. Hey, what's your problem? I already apologized for yesterday. So, do you wanna tell me what's going on? You know, the Cooper's Light Up is the single most important Christmas event in Maplewood. You know who sponsors the school? The hospital? And my daughter's dance program? Cooper's. Hmm. Your grandmother, she invested in this city and the people in it. Then you come along and everything changes. You seem to know a lot about the company. Yeah, I know enough. Then you should know we have about two years before Cooper shuts down. Shuts down? Unless someone like me does something about it. Cooper's has run at a loss for the past three years. We can't compete with the major brands. They have bigger budgets, better marketing. They're not afraid to play dirty and I should know, I worked for a few of them. Look, I loved that my grandma wanted to give back to Maplewood, but if we're gonna survive, we have to adapt. What are you doing? This place has the best spices. I'm gonna need a lot of them if we're gonna figure out your grandmother's secret recipe. Thank you. How did you get into baking cookies anyway? You strike me as more of a rye bread kind of guy. Excuse me? I'm a sourdough man. Dry and crusty. That makes sense. What kind of bread are you? Banana. You know, that doesn't count. Why does banana not count? Because banana is actually a cake. Well then, I'm eating too much cake. Okay. You didn't answer my question. I wanna know the secret behind your world famous cookies. It's complicated. You make complicated cookies? No, life is complicated. Three years ago, Bella and I lost her mum. Oh, I'm so sorry. It's okay. That particular Christmas I wanted Bella to smile again. So, I told her we could bake any kind of cookie that she wanted. Anything in the whole entire world. You know what she said? “Dad, I want a sugar plum cookie.” What is a sugar plum cookie? I had no idea, but I made it up. I don't know I guess, I guess that's my secret. I don't make cookies for me. I make cookies for Bella. And I guess now I'm baking cookies for you. Mmm. Close. - Munchier... - Munchy. Right. Mm-hmm. Okay. All these batches are slightly different, but I think I have the right ratio of base ingredients. The water, sugar, flour, and eggs. Now, it's just a matter of nailing down the flavor agents. So, what do you think? They are all really good. But none of them are quite right. Well, it's okay. Which do you think is closest? - That one. - That one. Hm, I thought it was that one. I think I need to try them all again. Hey. Where've you guys been? Cooper's. So, we went back to check the digital log on the alarm. The thief used an employee code that should have been disabled. Which employee? Grandma's. There's only one explanation for how someone got their hands on that code. It had to be an inside job. Best Christmas ever! Charlie? Mm, mm-mm. He stayed late at the Christmas party. Besides, he's a very sweet man. What about Parker? Parker, Parker, no way. He volunteers on his days off and he teaches Bible studies at the church on Sundays. Phil and Ned? Robot Ned, do humans taste as good as their cookies? Robot Phil, only one way to find out. - Must eat humans. - Must eat humans. - No, definitely not them. - Nah, it's not them. No, probably not the elves. Jillian, you know all of the employees. Can you think of anyone who would do this? No, I'm sorry, I just can't imagine anyone who works here wanting to hurt Cooper's. What about someone who used to work here? A fired employee, still holds a grudge? Oh, I don't think there are many of those. Then, that should be easy to narrow it down. Go to HR and pull the last five years of employee records. I'm on it. I'm just gonna go see if she needs any backup. Mm-hmm. - Oh! - Oh. Miriam! You sure are stealthy for a woman of your... I believe you were going to say age. Uh, no. I was actually... I was... I was not... Don't worry, Miss Cooper. I'm not sensitive about such things. Age is a gift of wisdom and experience. And do you know what my gift is telling me right now? I... You are hiding something. I'm not sure what, but secrets always come out in the end. This is the best... Christmas ever. Okay, yeah. Not... not now, guys. - Oh. - Oh. Can we go again, one more time? Again? Okay, fine. Last time though. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Let me get this off. And 5, 6, 7, 8... Posture... Posture. And point the toe, point the toe. Point the toe. How nice. Oh... Remember nice and natural relaxed arms. Okay. And my favorite, arabesque. And port de bras. Bravo! Oh, come on, really! How long have you been standing there for? Oh, long enough. Mm-hmm. Dad's helping me with my solo for this year's dance recital. I saw. He's surprisingly graceful. Find any suspects? No, but we're chasing down a new lead. Really? Ex-employees with a grudge against the company. Revenge, a classic motive. Here you go. See you soon. Okay, we have a problem. The head of the board is starting to get suspicious, which means we have a lot less time than we thought. I need you to work late tonight. Ooh, yeah, no can't do. What do you mean? Do you not know how this works? You give me a cookie, I give you an oven. Listen Santa, this little elf has plans tonight. What could possibly be more important than this? Our Christmas party! All of our friends get dressed up and come over. Don't you have any big holidays plans, huh? Uh, no. Oh, what? Oh, no. Oh, guys. I know what you're thinking, "She's all alone on Christmas". But seriously, it's fine. I'm fine. Don't I look fine? Would you like to come to our house for a Christmas party tonight? Thank you. But I... I actually, I do have some work that I need to do. So, tomorrow. Cookies. - Bye. - Bye. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, there's another pie in the back of the fridge, I'll grab it right now. Ooh... Excuse me, guys. Merry Christmas. Hi. Hi. Ah, come on, come in. This is for you. Oh, thank you. You uh, you came. I was craving a little company. I hope that's okay. Yeah. Yes. Of course. Let me get your jacket. Wow, you look um... I look very out of place. I thought Bella said everyone got dressed up. Yeah. Yeah, uh we do. It's Nutcracker themed. Oh. Okay then. Well um, goodbye. Whoa, whoa. No, no, no. I got the perfect solution. See that. Huh, you fit right in. Thank you. You came! Come on, I'll show you around. Okay. Sam? Yup. The pie. I'm on it. Coming right up. Who made this masterpiece right here? Dad calls him “Ralph”, Rudolph's less famous older brother. Oh, poor little Ralph. Well, he didn't need to be hiding way down there. Is this your mom? She's absolutely beautiful. Everyone says I look just like her. Well, they're right. Is that you tucked in there all snug? Yeah. That was my first Cooper's Light Up. Mom took me every year, it was her favorite thing to do at Christmas. Oh, who invited Scrooge McDuck over there? I did. Hm? Remind me again, Frank, who invited you? Marge? There is something on your... What the... Funny guy. Beverage? Thank you. Guess you shouldn't have invited the big bad executive to your Christmas party, huh. Don't worry, I had them check their torches and pitchforks at the door. They just don't know you yet. And you do? No. But I'm willing to try. Cheers. Cheers. Wanna get some air? - Okay. - Come on. A musician? Really? Uh, it doesn't strike me as your type. Which is what? I was thinking you know, a nice little knit tie, maybe some pomade. Talking about the future of the crypto market. Yeah, I dated a few of those, too. I bet. So, what happened with the music man? Well, long story short. My career took off and his did not. And his ego couldn't handle it. Hmm. So you just left? Well, I couldn't be with someone who wanted me to act small just so he could feel big. Absolutely. That's Arthur. He's on his way. So, he gives you a ride everywhere? No, not everywhere. Sometimes I take an Uber or a taxi. I don't know really know how to drive. Oh, and here I was thinking you're just all fancy. I am. I'm very fancy. Um, when I was 18, my parents both died in a car accident. So, I didn't really feel like getting behind the wheel after that. Sorry. It was a long time ago. What about you? Do you have any romantic prospects? Mmm, nope. I don't do that sort of thing. What sort of thing? You don't date? I uh... not in a... Not in a very long time. Well, my grandma used to say, "A life baked with love, tastes ever so sweet." Well, I hate to break it to your grandma. I think this loaf has gotten pretty stale. I don't know. I mean sourdough, while it is dry and crusty on the outside... Hey. The inside... it just, you don't know. You don't know. There's Arthur. Um. So, um, tomorrow? Cookies? Yes. Tomorrow, cookies. We're gonna figure out that recipe. Thank you. Mm-hmm. And thank you for this. You're very welcome. Goodnight. Have a good night. I trust you had a nice evening, Miss Annie? A very nice evening indeed. No, no, you listen to me. I can't afford any more excuses. No, I told Gino I'd bring you in, but after what happened at Cooper's, I'm starting to reconsider. Frank? I gotta go. Everything okay? Yeah, yeah. Just uh, trouble at work. Hey uh, great party by the way, huh. But if you compare the reports from last year, we have turned a corner for the better. Those reports don't reflect a decline in public perception. You mean local perception, not national. Look, Annie was right. We can no longer prioritize the citizens of Maplewood over our bottom line. What are you talking about? City council would never go with it. After all, it's not Christmas without Cooper's. No, no. That's enough! We've been over this and it's not getting us anywhere. Annie, do you have any other items to address? Annie? Annie? What? Yes, I'm listening. Was there anything else you wish to discuss or may we adjourn? I would like to propose that we reinstate the Cooper Christmas Tree Light Up. But you were the one who requested that we cancel. Yes. But that was before... "Marketing aimed at a few thousand locals is an irresponsible waste of finances." Sound familiar? I said that. Very good memory. But what if we think of a way to make it responsible. But how do you plan on doing that? What if we look at it as a marketing opportunity rather than an expense. The brand will be on full display. Smiling kids, happy parents, holiday joy at every bite. It's not Christmas without Cooper's, right? So, let's capture what that means and share it with the world. We're listening. Here you go. Enjoy it. Okay, we need to get to work right away if we're gonna have everything ready in a week. I'll talk to accounting today. We need to make sure the town knows that it's back on. And I'm all over it. About time, you were supposed to be here an hour ago. Yes, I'm sorry, our meeting ran late. Um, hey, is Sam here? No, hon, he stepped out. But he's asked me to pull four batches of cookies out of the oven when the timer goes off. Did you happen to take a look at that list of employees we left you? No, I didn't. Something important came up. Something important... She knows that Christmas in in 10 days, right? Yeah. 10 days before this whole thing blows up in our faces. - I will get on it right away. - Oh, no need. I think we already found our guy. Greg Helmer, 35 years old. An executive assistant at Cooper's, Greg was in the perfect position to discover grandma's code. And then, three months ago, he was unexpectedly terminated. For what you might ask? - Theft of... - Theft of property, says it right here. You put that in file. That... - That's right. - That's great. Okay, this looks promising, but how are we gonna track him down? He was tagged in that photo two days ago. He works at the Christmas Market. Now, can we get the cops involved? No. No one can know about the theft until we have the recipe back. We'll handle this ourselves. Like the Mistletoe Mysteries. If I have to hear about that book one more time. What on earth are you people talking about? Sugar Plum, this is Nut Cracker. I have eyes on the Mouse King. Repeat, I have eyes on the Mouse King. Copy that, Nut Cracker. Target acquired. Waiting for instruction. Over. - What are you doing? - It's Bella's idea. Oh, she's 11, Calvin! I mean look at the walkies. These are mine. Disengage, Sugar Plum. The adults will handle this. Kids never get to have any fun. So, what do we do now? Do we just go up there, ask him questions, - see what he says? - No, no. He'll recognize both of you right away. But most people don't know that Cooper's even has an IT guy. - What are you gonna say to him? - Don't worry. I have a plan. Greg, Merry Christmas. Two bags of roasted nuts please. Are you sure Nutcracker can handle this? Maybe I should back him up. Negative, Sugar Plum, stay where you are. That'll be five bucks. - Can I level with you, Greg? - How do you know my name? I'm not really here for any roasted nuts. All I want is an order of the cold hard truth. I don't know what you're talking about. He doesn't know what he's talking about. We know you stole it, Greg. Who are you? Uh, are... are you a cop? The Mouse King can smell the cheese. I repeat, the Mouse King can smell the cheese. Hey, nobody said anything about cops, okay, Greg? Bella, we have got to get you out of here. Oh, geez! Okay, let's just calm down just a minute. No! No! No! - Calvin! Calvin! Calvin! - Oh! Thief! Thief! - Someone stop the thief! - Calvin, are you okay? - Somebody stop him! - Somebody stop him! That way! He went that way! - Somebody stop him! - Alright, see you later. Oh! You did it! They caught him. They caught him. That wasn't part of the script. Nice work, you got him! It... it was just some office supplies! I'll return them, I promise! I don't care about the pen or the stapler, - I want the recipe. - What recipe? Don't mess with me, Greg. - Annie. - What? You said the person who stole the recipe - was a regular? - Yes. Yeah, I've never served this guy a cookie in my life. Oh! I am so sorry! Really salty. I know, and they're very hot, too. Very hot! Can you see any shells? Calvin, are you okay? He just got some salt in his eyes. - It stings real bad. - He'll be okay. I'm guessing this didn't go according to plan? No, it did not. Just as long as Bella wasn't involved. That was so cool! Do you think those cookies are ready? Alright, here we go. Alright, get 'em over here please. - Okay. - Okay, do you want a taster? Now, one, two, three or four. Yes. Yes. Thank you. Now, you take these, too. Thank you. Hmm! - Yeah? - Hmm. Oh, that's so hot. Pa... pastry you get a good bite. That's the 1,000 nibble. Did you get the... Mm, no, I didn't actually. Oh. Well. Okay, so, which one's the closest? - One. - Three. - Five. - Two. There's only four. F... forget it. Alright, get out of here. I'm just gonna take this s'more. Appreciate it. Okay! Back to the drawing board again. Bella saw you throwing out those perfectly good cookies. You know, that's the thing. They're not perfectly good though, are they? - Go easy on yourself. - I can't go easy on myself. The longer it takes me to figure out this recipe, the more innocent people you're gonna accuse. Hey! I'm sorry. I'm just frustrated, you know? I'm not used to baking like this. It's all so mathematical. There's no instinct or... Or emotion involved. I know I'm missing something. It's probably right in front of my face. I just don't know what it is. You know, I think I have an idea. Did you ever bake with your grandmother - when you were a kid? - Yeah, all the time. Why? Perfect. Okay, I assumed you meant a good idea, not a ridiculous idea. Now, I know this maybe a long shot, but there's about a thousand different ways that I can combine those ingredients. Mmhmm. I just need somebody to help guide me. And that someone is you. But I haven't baked anything in a really long time. Oh. Well, it's a good thing that you have a great teacher. Hmm? So, the detective things clearly isn't working out for you now, is it? Come on, what do you got to lose? Okay, where do we start? Ah! ♪ I've been here before Holly hangin' on the door ♪ ♪ The trees dressed up in lights ♪ - Wow! - ♪ Back when we were kids ♪ ♪ The season always felt like this ♪ ♪ The lights were shinin' bright ♪ ♪ I wanna capture the feelin' ♪ - This shouldn't take long. - Okay. ♪ The warmth of holiday music ♪ ♪ And coziness by the fire with you ♪ ♪ I just wanna feel the magic ♪ ♪ One more time ♪ ♪ Just like we had at Christmas time ♪ Oh, yaee, yaee, yaee! ♪ I want the sparkle in the eye ♪ ♪ Of a kid on Christmas night ♪ All I want to see is ♪ ♪ Little presents he's to find - Oh, those look good! - ♪ The magic one more time ♪ ♪ The magic of Christmas time ♪ ♪ I just wanna feel the magic, magic ♪ ♪ I just wanna feel the magic one more time ♪ ♪ I wanna capture the feeling ♪ ♪ The warmth of holiday music ♪ ♪ And coziness by the fire with you ♪ - Tada! - Bravo, bravo! Oh, thank you. You're so good, darling. ♪ I just wanna feel the magic one more time ♪ - Mm. - Well? It's so good. It's still not quite right. Okay, well, we have plenty of time. Christmas is in four days, Sam. I know. Well, we better get started on another batch, huh? Don't worry. We'll figure this out. I promise. You know, the tree light up is tomorrow. Oh, I know, the whole town is buzzing about it. I was thinking it could be fun if the three of us went together. You, me, and Bella. Um, yeah, yeah. You know, that's something that um, Bella and I used to do with her mom. - I'm so sorry. I should've... - No, no, no, no. No, no. I just... I don't know. I think maybe it just might be a little confusing for Bella. - For Bella? - Yeah. Well, I'm... I'm sure I'll... I'll see you both there. Yeah! Yeah, yeah, Um, it's really fun. I mean they got this huge tree. They got um, kids running around everywhere. It's... it's very Christmassy. They got carolers. There is uh, all kinds of stuff... I mean that looks like the closest clue we've gotten. Yeah, that's what you think. In the last like hour. Someone's waiting for you in the kitchen. Okay. I'm glad you're here. When you asked about the light up, I, uh... I should've handled that differently. I guess I was just um... I was just scared, you know? When you lose somebody that you thought you'd spend the rest of your life with, you just hold on every... Every memory that you shared together. Uh, I know that I hurt your feelings, and I'm sorry. That was beautiful, buddy. Of course, I forgive you. What are you doing here? Oh, yeah, Annie uh, she called me yesterday. Wanted me to install it. - To install what? - Your new oven. New oven. And she even got you the extended warrantee. - Well, enjoy the oven, buddy. - Thanks. Uh, Merry Christmas, Frank. - Wasn't it wonderful? - Yeah, yeah. What's the matter? I just really need to figure out this recipe, Marge. I just don't think that we're looking - at the right motive here. - Right. Uh, maybe whoever stole it just really enjoys eating cookies. - That's everyone. - Yeah, it's everyone. Okay, let's... let's start again. Where you goin'? Yo, Frank! Frank, what are you... What are you doing? I only took one. Okay, I took three, but that's it, I swear. Ah, guilty conscience, huh? Alright, I need you to be honest with me. What happened at Cooper's three weeks ago? What? I heard you on the phone at my party. You said there was a... A slip up at Cooper's. You mentioned somebody named “Gino”. Yeah, look, Gino's my brother, okay? He wanted me to hire his son, which I did, and it was a terrible mistake. The kid doesn't even know righty tighty. Almost caused a gas leak at the factory. Look, man, you... you're not gonna tell anyone, right? Cooper's is my biggest contract. I can't lose them. No, no, look, your secret is safe with me, okay? I just... I just wanted to make sure - that you're alright. Huh? - Thanks, Sam. I feel like we really connected today. - Ah, give me a hug! - Oh, geez! Okay. Wow! Merry Christmas. Alright. Alright. - Wow. - Well, well, well! Look, who is accusing innocent people now. I deserve that. Yeah. You know... you know about... About last night um... You know... you know... you know when you lose somebody you... you're tryin' to hold on to, but then... The... that the holding on was too tight that you say stuff that you have to... the... The hurting of the... and um... Yeah, I said this to Frank earlier, it came out much better. - You said it to Frank? - Mmhmm. Yeah, but in all fairness I did think it was you. It wasn't. It's okay. You don't have to say it again. It means a lot that you would chase down a possible suspect for me. I... I hope it's okay. It's eggnog flavored. - Eggnog's my favorite. - Mine, too. - Hey! - Hey! Hi. So, Calvin and I were just thinking... Well, I can't take any credit. I mean Jillian mentioned it to me and I was like, “That's so true.” She's incredibly smart and good at her job. - If you haven't noticed... - Oh, Calvin. Sorry. We were thinking that uh, it's been two weeks since the recipe was stolen and we haven't heard a peep about it. That was kind of the plan. No, she means from the thief. I mean no ransom note, no blackmail, nothing. Wouldn't they wanna benefit from it somehow? I mean maybe they just wanna hurt Cooper's. Uh, Maplewood didn't exactly celebrate when you first showed up. Maybe this isn't about Cooper's. Maybe it's about hurting you. So cute, you guys! Don't forget to tag us using the hash tag Cooper's Christmas. Can I see it? Oh, that looks great! Good job! - Hey. - Hey. Congratulations, we did it! Okay, so, in a few words, what does Cooper's mean to you? Oh, elves, come this way. Okay, let's make sure that we all have our cameras ready to capture those magic Christmas moments. Okay. Oh, I can't believe how great this turned out! So great. And we're gonna have enough content to fill our marketing campaigns for the entire year. Oh, yeah. I just hope I'm still in charge by then. - Annie. - You're right. You are right. You're not gonna talk about theft, not gonna talk about secret enemies. Tonight is a night for celebrating. - Hmm - Where are Phil and Ned? Oh, um, they should be on stage any minute. On stage? Oh, wow! Hi there. Annie, guess what? I did my whole solo at rehearsal and didn't make a single mistake. No way! It's amazing! You're gonna blow the roof off that place. I'll make sure my dad saves you a seat. Hey, Bella, you wanna check out the lights over there? Let's go. She invited me a few days ago, but I um, I can just tell her that I... I can't... No, no, no, no. Don't do that. I want you to go. The more friendly faces, the better, right? Okay. Well, you two have fun tonight. Um, I'm gonna go check on Santa Claus. Hey, um, when was the last time that you had a Cooper s'more? I remember the first time grandma made one of these for me, it blew my mind. Now, the secret is a perfectly-toasted marshmallow. It takes patience, but it's totally worth it. Okay, you're one of those. Efficiency, productivity, profit, Sam. By the time you make one of those, - I will have eaten two. - Yeah. It's just good business. Let's see if it's as good as you remember. - Mm. - Huh? Mmhmm. I wish I had spent more time with her when I had the chance. Yeah. Well, no matter what, you never feel like you have enough time. After my parent's accident, grandma asked if I wanted to move to Maplewood. I could leave New York, I could start over. But I was 18 and you know, I had a whole life there. Maplewood, this was just a place that we used to come on vacation. I gave just about anything just to hear her tell one more of her corny jokes. They are the best. How much did Santa pay for his sleigh? How much? Well, nothing. It was on the house. Thank you for that. - Hi. - Hey. Anytime. How do you do it all? Ballet, soccer practice, school projects. I just show up, every day, as much as possible. It's not easy. I definitely don't always get it right. You're a really great dad, Sam. Thank you. But you're terrible at s'mores. Hmm? Oh! Here, you wanna try one of mine? I'm gonna have to. Mm. Mm. Thank you. ♪ Ah, ah, ah ♪ - Hi. - Hi. Uh, I thought you could use something warm. Uh, two candy canes, extra whipped cream. That's exactly how I order it. I know. I... I watch you. I mean I... I... I... I pay attention. I just... Okay, what I really mean is I... I like... I... I like... I... Calvin. Sam, Annie. - Hey! - Hey. Hi. I didn't know Miriam and Marge were friends. Oh, yeah, yeah. Miriam comes in every weekend. She gets a dozen cookies. - She comes in every weekend? - Uh-huh. Well, I mean she hasn't been in a couple of weeks, now that you mention it. Oh, she's not coming. She wasn't feeling well apparently. Whoever it was knew exactly how to get in undetected, erase the security footage... Annie. If you so much as stumble, I will not hesitate to replace you. - Annie♪ Hello? You okay? - I'm so sorry. I forgot I need to check on something. - I'll be right back. - Uh, okay. - I need your help. - But I don't wanna... I know who stole the recipe. Don't go anywhere. Miss. Cooper, what... what... What if somebody comes? Everybody's watching the tree lighting, - we'll be fine. - Are you sure it was her? Do you know who takes over as interim CEO if I get fired? The head of the board. Let's be quick. I'm really not cut out for this mystery stuff, okay? Too late. Oh, come on! Jeez! Hey, look, I... I... I don't have a credit card or... - Or a hair pin or... - I have the keys! Of course you do. Of course she does. Just be cool. Ow! Okay, it is too dark in here. - I'm using my flashlight now. - No! That is how the guys from Watergate got caught. Well, that comparison is not reassuring. Start with the desk. We're not ransacking the place, we're looking for grandma's recipe! I'm not expert in burglary, okay? - Just please be kind. - Okay. I'm sorry. Thank you. Now, who is ready to light this tree? - Where's Annie? - And Calvin. Dad, they're gonna miss it. No, they'll be back. They'll be back. - Uh, maybe you were wrong. - No! It fits. She wanted me gone. She had the motive, she had the means. Okay, Maplewood, you know what to do. Ten second countdown on my mark. Oh, this is so exciting. Ten, nine, eight, seven... Miriam stole grandma's recipe and we are going to prove it. One! Is that so? And what makes you so sure I'm guilty of this crime you tried to cover up? You weren't at the Christmas party - the night it was stolen. - Oh, I was ill. You can call my doctor if you like. You're a regular at Bella's Bakery. Well, I don't see how that's relevant, but yes, their cookies are excellent. They're so good. Sorry. And you never wanted me to run Cooper's in the first place. That, I'm afraid, is true. I told Rose I didn't think you were the right fit. I was afraid you would change this company beyond recognition. But she believed you were the perfect person for the job. And for a moment there, so did I. But I was wrong. I am placing you on administrative leave, effective immediately. The board will decide what happens next. Miss Cooper, I'm... I'm so sorry. Okay, got one. - Yeah? What'd you pick? - Jingle All the Way. Oh, nice. A Schwarzenegger classic. Uh. Oh, who's that? Hey, uh, we looked for you after the light up. Come in. I don't know what's wrong with me. All I've done since I got here was just make one mistake after another. Yeah, pretty much. I'm just kidding. Come on. Your heart was in the right place. You just tried to save the company. The board has to see that. The board will meet tomorrow, and they will fire me, Sam, and that is that. Alright. - What are you doing? - Oh, we're baking cookies. Sam, we've tried every variation. - It's not... - No, no, this is for fun. Come on, whatever you want. It's late! Trust me, this is gonna put a smile on your face. I promise. Yeah? - Are we making cookies? - We are! Woo-hoo! ♪ Friends and strangers gather around like family ♪ ♪ In love with every color on the Christmas tree ♪ ♪ Let your heart surrender ♪ ♪ No more enemies ♪ ♪ For one we're all together in peace and harmony ♪ ♪ I wish it'd last forever not just for one day ♪ ♪ Oh, Christmas, will you come light the way ♪ And my personal favorite is The Holiday Heist. I don't wanna spoil the ending for you, just in case. Oh, I should have read those books. Maybe I would have been a better detective. Wait, you never read the “Mistletoe Mysteries?” I have not. Hold on. Ooh, you be careful. You're gonna have to read the whole series now. - What is this? - Banana bread. You remembered what kind of bread I am? Mm, technically you're a cake, remember? Which is fitting, 'cause uh, you have a lot of layers. And if you like that, wait till you try my zucchini loaf. Now, that is pretty darn good. There's this recipe for beetroot brownies that I've been meaning t... - Sam, I... - Uh, I just... Found it! You can borrow the first one and see if you like... - What's wrong? - Nothing. Well, it's just... It's late, that's all. Yes, it... it is getting late. So I should um, I should probably go, but you guys have a great... Great night. Hey! I'm sorry. No, I'm... I'm sorry. I, as usual, completely misread all the clues. No. No, you didn't, okay? It's not that I don't... I just... I don't have time in my life for this, okay? Bella is my whole world and I have to put her first, always. I understand. - Annie... - I just... I wanted to hold your hand more than I've wanted anything in a really long time. How pathetic is that? Annie, wait, wait. Annie! So, in just a few words, what does Cooper's mean to you? Oh, good question. Comfort. Delicious snack. Oh, yeah. Cute. Want a bite, Santa? It is a passion. I don't know. Romance? No. Uh, sorry, um... - Romance, I said. - Yeah, I know. A lot of gifts. Remembering Christmas with my mom. Sharing lots of lovely food. Oh, that's a tough one. Cooper's means so much to so many people. How do you pick just one? - Sam. - Yeah. Do you wanna get hot chocolate? Uh, Yes. Uh, excuse me. Oh, sorry! Merry Christmas. Miss Cooper, we're ready for you now. And as a result of her action, has placed the entire company at risk. I think it's clear to everyone here what must be done. I say we vote and be done with it. Annie, is there anything you'd like to say before we vote? I didn't understand what Cooper's really was... what it meant to people. Or if I did, I didn't care as long as I was protecting grandma's legacy or what I thought was her legacy. The business, the money? She didn't care about any of that, not really. She wanted to bring joy and happiness to people. To make people laugh, and smile. She never baked cookies for herself. She baked them for all of us. And I wish I had realized this sooner. I know it's just a slogan, but it's true. It really isn't Christmas without Coopers. Miriam? Very well. Let's vote. Miriam. Just the person I wanted to see. Arthur. I was hoping I might have a word with the board. Certainly. Uh, come on up. Dad, let's go. I have to get ready. Yeah, I'm comin', I'm comin'. Grab your jacket. Where are my keys? Make sure you and Marge save Annie a seat. You know what, kid, uh, I don't know if she's gonna be able to make it tonight. She said she'd come. She promised. - I know. I'm sorry. - I thought she liked me. What? What're you talkin' about? Of course, she likes you. You're the coolest kid in town. I thought she liked you, too. Come over here. You know, you're the most important thing in the whole world to me, right? I told your mom I'd take care of you, and I'd love you, and... And make you laugh at least once a day. That's exactly what I'm gonna do. Even if it means I need to learn ballet. You love it. Mm, don't tell anybody. Let's go. Come on, Bell, we're gonna be late. Come on. I promised her I'd look after you, too. And she always said that Christmas was about love and joy for everyone. She did say that, didn't she? So, then she meant it for you too, right? - Come on, let's go. - Okay. It's Christmas Eve tomorrow. But you probably know that, 'cause I'm sure you now know everything. I'm sorry I let you down, grandma. Well, now, I think I preferred the financial reports to that kind of talk. I was supposed to come here and save Cooper's, and instead, left it in ashes. I just hope the cops can do what I couldn't and just find whoever stole grandma's recipe. I highly doubt they will. I didn't leave any clues. What are you talking about? Well, at least none that I didn't want found. Arthur! Will we see you at the Christmas party tonight? Oh, I don't think so, my dear. It was a shame not to cash in on my punch card, but a necessary sacrifice, I think. Might I recommend you try the sugar plum snaps? They are delightful. Why would you steal grandma's recipe? - Because she asked me to. - She what? Let me explain. Do you know how proud your grandmother was of you, hmm? I mean she told me about every promotion, she showed me every article that mentioned your work. She had every faith that you could lead Cooper's into the future. So long as the heart of the company wasn't lost along the way. So, she asked you to steal her recipe? Rose did have a mischievous side. And she thought that Sam Hobbs, being a very talented man, and a bit of a snob when it comes to Maplewood, might be able to show you how much Cooper's means to this town. Of course, the ingredients are all listed on the box, but it would take a highly-skilled baker to figure out the right combination. I cannot believe she actually thought that would work. Well, I admit that she did underestimate how much you'd focus on catching the thief... Over figuring out the recipe. And I spoke with the board and I explained the whole situation. - Did they listen to you? - I should hope so. I am one of the largest shareholders after all. Rose was quite generous, you know? But I do very much enjoy driving my car. You do know that you two are absolutely crazy, right? Yeah. Um, Miriam said exactly the same thing. - Arthur. - Miriam. - Here it is. - Thank you. I think I'll need some time before I forgive Rose for this one. It's her last big joke. Look, I know I cannot run Cooper's like I ran other companies. I... I see that now, but we do need to evolve. It's true. But we need to evolve in a way that my grandma would have wanted. And I'm gonna need your help. I didn't always appreciate your grandmother's sense of humor. But I always trusted her. I just wish I'd trusted her about you. I look forward to working with you, Annie. I hate to interrupt... But I believe there's a dance recital at the school this evening, Miss Annie, and it would be a shame to miss it. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. And Merry Christmas, Rose. - Can I take you somewhere? - That would be lovely. It's time. You're on next. Good job. Bella, you're on. Wooh! No, no. Bella. You got this. No, I don't. Yes, you do! It's just like we practiced. There's too many people. I can't do it. It's okay. It's okay. What are you doing? Something that absolutely terrifies me. And if I can do it, so can you. You got it from here? Yeah. Okay, fantastic. Yes. You did awesome! Ooh, you kidding me? Oh, my goodness. You did so great! That was amazing. I'm so proud of you. Did you see, dad? She came! I... I did see that. Yeah. - She went out the back. - Oh, yeah. I'm okay, dad. Go! Okay. Those are for you. I'm so proud of you. Annie! Sam, I promised Bella that I would be here, and I couldn't let her down. But you weren't supposed to see me, - I'm sorry. - Sorry? Sorry for what? For being there for my daughter when she needed you the most? You know, I am an idiot. I... I should have just said “yes” when you invited us to the light up. - Sam. - You know, the... the... the The truth is... Is I've just been scared to let somebody in again. I've been... I've been scared for a long time. And then you come along, you come crashing into my life. - Crashing? - Yes, crashing. - You accused me of a crime. - I uh, yes, I did do that. Yeah, you bribed me to make cookies. I paid you to make cookies. Involved my daughter in a sting operation. That one was actually Calvin. Yeah, and generally, you created mayhem and chaos. Okay! When you'll list it all at once. Yeah, you know, by all rights, I should stay away from you. I should stay very, very far away from you. But instead, I just have one question for you. Annie Cooper, can I please hold your hand? ARTHUR, MARGE AND BELLA: ♪ We wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ We wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ And a Happy New Year ♪ Go ahead, open it. Oh, I wonder what this is. I think it's a scooter. Oh, it's a book! Oh, my goodness! “The Case of the Runaway Reindeer.” I've been waiting for this one. Somebody's very happy. - Thank you, Annie! - You are so welcome. Oh. Oh, here you go. I think you're probably sick of cookies by now, but... I never get tired of grandma's recipe. Oh, these ones aren't grandma's. Mm. These are the ones we made with Bella. Wow! But I think these might taste even better, right? I still don't know what the missing ingredient is though. - Oh! - My favorite. I do.
