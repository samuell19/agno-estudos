Mom is calling you. She can't find the Christmas stuff. Uh huh, whatever. Is anyone even listening to me? No. Eleanor! We're having a holiday party at school today. Are you having one? That's for kids. We don't have those parties in Jr. High. How's that Santa coming? The glue won't stick. I like the ornaments you made last year. Did you find them yet? Which ones did we make last year? The Popsicle stick reindeer. The Popsicle stick reindeer. Of course! I don't know. We'll ask mom, okay. Are you girls ready for school? Only two more days and Christmas vacation. Good, after tomorrow I can sleep in all day. Eleanor, you making an ornament? No, it's stupid. What? How can this be? I can't believe that you, of all of my children, are going to break the great Ferguson family tradition, with no ornament! Why is there so much laundry to do? What is it honey? Have you seen this pile of laundry Gary? Where are the Christmas lights? We're the only house on the whole block without any up. Sounds like fun down there. Coming. Dinky lights, pathetic tree... another great Ferguson tradition. What do you care? You said you didn't believe in Santa anyway. I don't, but I believe in presents. I don't know what you did with them. Of course, it's my fault. Mommy, Eleanor [Unclear] Santa. -I did not! Ho ho ho. Liv, finish your breakfast. -You're not my mommy. What are those, the inside of the terminator? No, it's our Christmas lights. Those are pretty Gary. The Fergusons will have lights. Right. It's all right, I can untangle these. Perfect...just in time for Easter. No, no, no. I can handle it. I just need to find an end. -Mommy, Elly's being mean. -Don't call me Elly, my name is Eleanor. I might make it work. Why don't we just buy new ones? Oh that's right, we can't afford new ones. We've maxed out four credit cards. What do you want me to do? It would just be nice if maybe you could paid for some of that work you did. Oh, oh, see these huh. Tada! Wow. Okay. I'll admit it; it's going to be a lean Christmas. Do you have any work lined up Gary? Well, I finished a plumbing job on the Larrys yesterday, so I'll send an invoice out today. Great, and do you think that maybe sometime this year you could fix the downstairs toilet, because it still doesn't work. Look, I've got a few leads on some things okay. Something's going to come up. Something always comes up. And what about if it doesn't? You know you can't pay bills with optimism Gary. Four days till Christmas. Four days. I can't buy anything and we need everything. Mommy, we're going to be late. Oh, what about this? Wail till you see. It's going to be beautiful. We don't even have a tree Gary. I know. Perfect. Perfect, I mean what else could go wrong? You know what, don't worry? Don't worry. It's going to be a great Christmas. I'm going to get a tree, I promise you. From where, the park? Yes, the park. That's a great idea. Mom, I have a test... I'm going to take the kids to school. I can't be late; it's the end of the semester. Come on Eleanor! Where's Mom? I'm giving her a break. Get in. I'll walk. Olivia! Olivia, you forgot your cookies. We stayed up so late making these. And you left them on the table. Silly goose. -Oops. -Oops. Eleanor, where are you going? Where do you think? (Sigh) Mommy, are we going to have a Christmas tree? Baby, ask your dad. Absolutely. It might not have any branches... No branches? Where will we hang our ornaments? Do you remember that old cartoon I showed you? Well we will wrap the tree in your blanket and it will grow to a full-size Christmas tree. Like magic? Christmas is the most magic time of the year. It's when wishes come true. Right honey? Have fun at your party, okay. Okay. And eat lunch before you go eating all the cookies. Okay Mommy. Oh, I didn't finish my Santa yet. Can I finish it when I get home? Yes, of course you can. Beautiful day! [engine starts] Eleanor? Eleanor? Get in the car, it's cold. Daddy, does Eleanor hate Christmas? No, no, of course not! Does Mom hate Christmas? No baby; nobody hates Christmas. Eleanor, get in the car now! Mom hates Christmas. It always puts her in a bad mood. Thank you Eleanor, welcome to the Ferguson carpool. [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh, Olivia, Olivia, Olivia. (Phone Rings) Oh, you didn't get the payment? No ma'am we didn't. We are going to need that payment right away. Okay, well, I'm going to put it on my card. You didn't get the payment? No, I'm sorry we didn't. Yeah, I sent it. Well, I have no record of it here ma'am. Could you just look over the bill again, because, I think there's a mistake. I guess I just misplaced the bill. I don't know... Well the late fee ... Yeah, I'm usually so good about these things. I was wondering if you could waive that late fee? You know, I'm hardly ever late...we're never late. This is the first time. I sent the payment. I have no idea...right. You know, I just pay half...well; I could pay you half of that now. Full minimum payment. Full minimum payment. Full minimum payment. The check's in the mail. Thanks. [music throughout] [in distance] Ho Ho Ho, Merry Christmas. -Nick! -Thank you. I'm here, Sheila... Come on, I don't have that much time. Can I help you? Were you interested in something in the window? Yeah, the red dress. How much? $1200. Plus tax? Mhm. Would you like to try it on? Uh, oh yes! Well I'll grab one for you. [door opens, closes] -Paula! -(Gasp) I thought that was you! Nick, hi. Yeah, it's me. Great. Wow, what a surprise! Yeah. So, I mean, you're back in town. Well I guess I couldn't stay in Nice forever, could I? What are you doing here? Ah, yeah, shopping. How long has it been since we've seen each other? -Four years? -Five. Five. Your father's memorial. Yeah. You still painting? Oh yeah. Hi. You remember Paula don't you? We went to school together. She used to work for my father's gallery. Of course. Hello. Hi. Honey, I need the AMEX. So how's Gary? Oh, great. Still doing construction. Have you been to my gallery lately? No, no. Not in a long time. Oh, you should see the lineup of new artists I've discovered. Wow. Are you still doing florals? Yeah, all the time. Well then, you've got to come. You'll love the new show. Honey, we're late. I'm inviting Paula to the opening. [both] What? The new show opens tonight. You and Gary should come. Really? Yeah, 8 o'clock tonight. That dress will look great on you. I gotta go. But, um, thank you. It's really good to see you. Are you going to take any of those? You know, I'm going to think about it and maybe I'll be back tomorrow. I'll look forward to seeing you there. [sound of streetcorner Santa in distance] I have nothing to wear. Honey, you look good in nothing. I mean whatever you wear; you're going to look great. I have nothing good enough. Well what about the lime green pant suit my mom gave you for Christmas last year? Okay, forget that I even offered that. Why are we even going to this? What? What are you talking about now? Well you don't even have to go to this gallery thing. We never go anywhere Gary and this is free. It's something we can afford, right? [woman's voice] Mrs. K.! Mrs. K.! you're going to be late for your appointment with Armando! Oooh, losing my mind! I hope Santa brings me a pretty dress. Yeah, have him bring me one too. Hi baby. Mommy, look, do you like my Santa? I do, you did such a good job! You didn't even see it. Oh, I did. It's as adorable as you are. Are you dressed for an 80s party? You're funny. Okay, you girls be in bed by 10, okay? Gary? -Hey, you look terrific. -Oh, thanks. Can I have this dance? Come on, let's go. We're going to be late. Eleanor, may I have this dance? You have to go, you'll be late. I'll dance with you daddy. You will? Come on. Hand please? Yes. Dad, you're so weird. Good night girls. Let's go. [shivering] Your chariot has arrived Mrs. Ferguson. I left the pin in my skirt. I completely forgot to sew it! Oh my god. Baby, you can't even see it. Gary! There's going to be women in there whose dresses cost over $1200. plus tax. Mine was at the Goodwill and it has a pin in it. You can barely even see it, I'm telling you. It looks great. Oh, Prairie Fauvists. [music and chatter throughout] And I replied, sweetie... ...nobody does Aspen on Christmas day. Oh Aspen's done. Everyone goes to Telluride. Completely out of date. Gary, can you not push me? Do you see anyone else pushing their wife? Gary! Paula! Oh great, the old flame Janine! Come on, I like Janine. Well then, you talk to her. Hi guys. Hi. Can you believe this place? -It's amazing. -It's pretty great. How are you Gary? Not bad. Not bad. Where's Nick? Over by the window; he's the one surrounded by all the girls - the same as high school. Well, go on and say hi. We'll just stay here and discuss painting. House painting. Good, have fun. Thank you. I bet Nick can't paint a house. I bet he doesn't do copper plumbing either. [chatter throughout] Paula. Nick. Oh, I didn't even see you. You made it. Is Gary here? Yeah, he's over there. I want to show you something; I'm so glad you came. Hello. -Hi sweetie. -How are you? Hello, gorgeous. You look lovely, both of you. Great work. Have to tell you, it really feels great to be back. So what do you think of this? Very modern. What is it? Garbage. (Laughs) How you been? Good. Gosh it must be so nice to travel around Europe, buying art. Well, I've missed people. You're surrounded by people. Not friends. I was dating this guy last year but it fizzled, he didn't want kids. Well, you know what; you'll find someone because you're a good person. So what are you doing to keep yourself busy these days? Life. I've two girls, so there is always, always something. Yeah. Kids are great. I never went down that road. No? Yeah, god, they're your life. Would you be interested in working in a Art Gallery again? You mean like working here? Sh, our secret. Hi. Sheila, hi. Nice to see you again. You too. Wow, that's a fantastic skirt. Honey, Malcolm and Shanite would like to talk to you about the large piece from Florence. Mr. and Mrs. Kensington, photo please? Good night. Nice seeing you Paula. Nice skirt... I know. Hey, I'm done. I'm done. I'm ready to go. Okay, hang on. I'm going to go say goodbye to Nick. Why? Well, because I didn't get a chance to say hello. Which piece did you like? Excuse me, just a second. You know how lucky you were? What? Dating both of them in high school? Yeah. You ended up with the right guy though. I bet Gary's a great dad. Yeah, he is. [indistinct chatter] Did you enjoy the party? How's Janine? Maybe I should have taken her to Prom. What are you doing? [radio playing quietly] What was dad drinking last night? Once we put our ornaments on it, the tree will look great. That's not a tree, that's a branch. Admiring our Christmas branch girls? All right, let's go ladies. Last day of school before Christmas vacation. Keep it moving. Mush. Mush. Hi girls. -Hi Reg. -Hey. Hey Gary, you ready to go? I got the lights. Yeah, do you mind dropping the girls off a school? I'll meet you at the sight. Yeah, sure. Come on guys. Back-packs, back-packs. Let's go. Love you daddy. All right, have a good day. -Bye dad. -Thank you. How about you sweetheart? Me? Oh, I was booking a flight to France, taking in the Louvre, doing a little holiday shopping in Paris and then dinner at the Ritz. The usual. Enjoy the Louvre. [quietly] I'm sorry Gary. [quiet music throughout] [crying] [music throughout] [chuckles] There you are. [woman's voice] Mrs. K., you're going to be late for your appointment with Armando! Remember lunch at the club afterward! Mrs. K... Mrs. K.! You're going to be late for your appointment with Armando! [Music] [Music] [Music] (Grunts) Oh! [gasp!] Mrs. K., you fall down! Are you all right? Yeah. I think I'm okay. Let me help you up. I don't know how this happened. Not to worry Mrs. K.. Mrs. K.? You prefer now I call you Mrs. Kensington? [man's voice] Martina, is Paula up yet? [whispers] No! No, not yet. Tell her I hired someone to put up the Christmas lights, okay? Okay. Was that Nick asking for me? Yes. Where's Sheila? Sheila... At the gallery. [gasp] Oh, this is so strange. I know. This is a very strange time for all of us. Vayamos. [gasp] [Music] [chuckles] Oh my god, look at that! [Unclear] Oh god, this is so gorgeous. Yes, you picked that one up in Italy this summer. Very nice. I picked that up in Italy? Yes, only the best for you Mrs. Kensington. Only the best. Oh, your hair appointment... My hair appointment? Okay. One thing. Yes, yes? I'm Mrs. Kensington? Are you feeling all right Mrs. Kensington? Why do you keep calling me that? Are you're Martina? Oh please, Mrs. K., it's been a tough enough day without you acting like this. Did you take too much of your prescriptions again? My...? No. No, good. There is so much going on; so much stress already. You must get going. This must be a dream, but it seems so real. Oh, brunch at the Club at 11. Right, brunch at the Club at 11. Okay. Okay! [?] ? I never imagined anything else; ? ? always thought I could take care of myself. ? ? But now I'm making a brand new start, ? ? and I've had a change of heart. ? ? Feelings are hidden deep inside of me; ? ? they have to get out, they have to break free. ? ? And now I find I've been playing a part, ? ? and I've had a change of heart. ? Hi honey. ? When I see you smile, ? ? it makes life worthwhile. ? Now I've got the style ? It's all about you, it's all about me. ? ? The road may be rocky, the road may bend, ? ? but we're going to make it to the end. ? ? And now we're making a brand start, ? ? and I've had a change of heart. ? [Music] ? It's all about you, it's all about me. ? ? The road may be rocky, the road may bend, ? ? but we're going to make it to the end. ? ? And now we're making a brand start, ? ? and I've had a change of heart. ? [Music] [Music] ? I've had a change of heart. ? Well, as far as dreams go, this is 1st Class! Oh Mrs. K... [unclear] You need to get going. Don't keep Armando waiting. Oh, Armando? Yes. [door opens] Oh don't bother dropping by today, I'm tied up. Enjoy yourself. I have a very hard working husband, don't I? Si. Where was I having lunch once again? At the Club. The Club. -Yes. -Which Club? The Montclair. Oh, oh. The one up on the hill? Yes. Yeah, I knew that. [Unclear] Too much prescriptions. [horn honks] Merry Christmas! (Laughter) Hi. Yes, I'm here for my appointment with Armando. To the Club as usual. Oh, maybe I'm meeting Nick. Paula! Honey! Who cut your hair last? Who did this to you? Have you been cheating on Armando? Yes. Please take pity on my hair Armando. What do you want me to do with this? I know, I know, up. Up and big. Big. We need, blonder, we need bigger, we need sexy! Who's a bad girl? Who's a sexual kitten? Me! Yes! Scissors! -Ready? -Yeah. [sigh] Another masterpiece by Armando. You look beautiful. [quiet music] Paula, over here? Wow, what have you done to your hair? Don't you love it? We're talking about what to do for New Years. Didn't you and Nick ski Aspen last winter? Oh, I'm sure we did. I don't you remember you staying in the condo. Maybe we stayed in a hotel. You wouldn't stay in a hotel, because you have a condo right next to Liz. -Who's Liz? -I am. Right. That Liz. Are you okay? We here Nick has a new publicist. I think he needed a new one. Quite attractive I hear. I hear she's brilliant with the press. Is she invited to your party? My party? Christmas Eve party. Wow, god, you know I completely forgot about that party. I'm just going to have to talk to Martina and we'll throw something together. Oh right. So, what are you wearing? Mm...the red dress. (Laughter) Yes! Mrs. Kensington, it's so good to see you again. Yes, well, it's the dream dress...for a dream. $1,200. I know, plus tax. Wrap it up please. And would you like to see the night gowns we just got in from Paris? Just came in this morning. Just to tempt you. How much? $800 each. $800 for a nightgown? From Paris. Right, a steal. Why don't I just fly the Paris and pick up a few. You could. Yes, yes I could. We are going to fly to Paris. It will be the perfect Christmas gift. London, Paris, Rome. [squeal] Where are we going? Oh yes, yes, yes. Maybe something tropical. Tropical or romantic. Tropical/romantic, tropical/romantic. [laughter] -Here you go. -Thank you. Hello, Mrs. Kensington? Oh hi, I'm just here to see Nick. Mr. Kensington is busy; he's in a private meeting. Oh, who with? He's doing press packets. Oh, well did he say how long he would be? He didn't say. (Knock on door) Nick? Hi. I told her you were busy. I'm in the middle of something here Paula. What would you like? Oh, I just wanted to ask you something. Ask me? It was kind of a personal matter. Can this wait until later? Sure. Yeah, of course. Oh, hey, where do you want to have dinner tonight? Ahh... Dinner? I'll be home at 7 o'clock. Okay, I'll have Martina make up something special, huh? Don't go out of your way to do anything special. Roxanne... No more interruptions. Boy he could really use a vacation huh? Which do you think he would prefer - a tour of Europe, or a Mediterranean cruise? He hates the water. Right, right. Well, Europe is still lovely this time of year, right? I'm back. Talk about shop until you drop, I'll tell you what... and you know, I used every single credit card in my purse. Gosh, wait till you see what I'm wearing to dinner tonight. Oh, where are you going? We're dining in tonight. Who is? Nick and I. So could you make something sexy? I have only frozen fish. Okay, well fish can be sexy. Fish with a little something on it. Something sexy? Yeah. [speaking Spanish] Okay. And we are having a party on Christmas eve, so we are really going to have to talk about the food. What food? It's catered. -It's catered? -Yeah. I am in heaven. Well I will be up in my bathroom having a luxurious Jacuzzi. [unclear] [?] [sigh] [laughs] I love Paris... when it drizzles. That's how it happens... ...one day the mind, she's gone. And I'm going to love Paris in the summer when it's sizzles! Hey Martina, guess who bought two tickets to Paris - where it sizzles? Who needs this many lights? Nick Kensington does. Didn't he marry your old girlfriend? Just keep doing what you're doing Reg. I see you're over her turning you down for the prom. Haven't you got some lights to hang? I will come down off this ladder. Easy big fella. Gary? Gary? What are you doing here? Hi Paula, Nick hired me to put up the Christmas lights. How are you? -Good. -Good. So, we haven't seen each other since... ...since the gallery opening. Oh right. Yeah, Janine and I had a great time. Thank you. Oh right. Oh, so you would be with Janine? Well yeah, since after high school. We... How are your kids? You have kids right? Yeah, two girls. Eleanor and Olivia. Yeah. Have you met them? Okay, Gary was here. Why? Why, why, why, why would I put Gary in my dream? And how long do dreams last exactly? And why am I talking to myself? Do you think I have too much jewelry on? If you were a float in a parade no, but for a person, yes. What time does Nick... Mr. Kensington, usually get home from work? Oh Mr. K, he's often late. He probably has lots to do at the office, huh? Recently, yes. Mr. Kensington, it's almost 7, I'm leaving. I got more Christmas shopping. It's okay, I'll lock up. Good night Roxanne. Good night. Don't you have some shopping to do? I have everything I want for Christmas right here. Yes you do. [music playing] You know I'm thinking maybe he stopped off for some champagne. Uh huh... Or maybe even flowers. Okay. Hey, I am not drinking by myself anymore, so I am pouring you a glass. No thank you. Oh, I insist. What shall we 'cheers' to? To new beginnings at Christmas. Are you having a new beginning? Yes. I better go and check the sexy fish. No wait, wait, wait. It's my turn. We're going to 'cheers'. To new beginnings at Christmas time. Did I tell you I feel like I'm on my first date? Yes, many times, and your first date is very late. Yes, well he was at the office meeting with his new publicist; they seem to be getting along very well. He gets along with women. I wonder why we never had kids? Do you ever wonder why we never had kids? No I didn't. And I'm going to check the fish, I think, now it's not so sexy. Oh wait, what song should I put on? What do Nick and I usually dance to? He doesn't dance. -He doesn't? -No. Yeah, you know, he never danced in high school either. Now you're seeing the problems. [door opens] Uh-oh. Dinner ready? Well hello there stranger! Turn off that noise. Well, I thought we'd do a little samba before dinner. What are you talking about? I just finished a long day. And those damn photos didn't turn out for the press packet. I'm sorry, but you know samba can be relaxing. Come on, I'll teach you. What are you doing? We don't dance. Loosen up Nick, come on, give it a shot. Come on, it'll be fun. How much wine have you had? Just a couple of glasses. Why did you stop by today? Sit down first. I got you an early Christmas gift. We've already given each other our Christmas presents Paula. Well this is extra. What is it? Well, you sir work way too hard, and we need a vacation. I'm starting to feel very awkward here Paula. Your dress, the dancing... what are you doing? Paris. Two tickets; you and moi. Hotel, spa, museums, art shows... We're not going to Paris Paula. Okay. It doesn't have to be Paris. We could go to Zurich. What are you talking about? What do you mean? We're getting a divorce. A divorce? We're not going anywhere together, ever again. That doesn't make sense. We're having a catered party on Christmas Eve. Well, the divorce is your idea; come to think of it, so is the party. My idea? Is this some ploy to re-negotiate the settlement? Everything is signed. Paperwork goes through midnight Christmas Eve. Midnight? That's when the sweet table comes out. You never could finish anything could you? The riding lessons; cooking classes; your attempt at art. Well, I'm finishing this one for you; we're over, as is this conversation. [soft music] [sigh] I need to talk to Nick. Are you kidding me? You asked for this divorce a year ago. I don't want this now. Well, it's a little late for that. Please, can't we just try to work this out? Maybe you should see Dr. Degolia, and have him adjust your prescription again. No, I don't need a prescription Nick. I need you. After $100,000 in legal fees? I don't want to have this conversation with you anymore. Understand? Well Nick, maybe there's something we haven't tried. How about counseling. We spent three years with Dr. Marson. But we have everything we need to make ourselves perfectly happy. It doesn't even make sense. That's what I thought a year ago, but apparently I made you miserable. Nick, I don't want us... this life to just end. You're unbelievable, you know that? You still don't care about me. You know I didn't hear you say, Nick, I realized I made a big mistake, or Nick, I've always loved you, I'll try to be a better wife. All you care about is having an expense account. Anyway... ...it doesn't matter anymore. The papers are signed. I'm moving on with my life, you should too. At my age I'd like the chance to be with someone who loves me. Like Sheila. Sheila loves me for who I am, not what I can give. You know back in high school Nick, I dated Gary Ferguson too. Did you know that? And I could have gone to the prom with either one of you, but in this life I chose you. And your point is? That I chose you! Life's all about choices Paula, every step of the way. Honey, I just need... oh... I'm sorry. It's okay. We're done. Okay, I'm ready to go home now, okay? This isn't fun anymore. I want to wake up from this dream now. [Olivia's voice echoes] Mommy? Can we keep him? Mommy, Mommy...Mommy. Mommy, look what I made. I love you Mommy. Oh. Well, Toto, looks like we're not getting back to Kansas. Can I get you anything Mrs. K.? [Music] Hello? Hello? Can you hear me? You lost a sock? I can't get back. I can't get back and I've made a terrible mistake. Get back? Where are you going? I thought this was where happiness is, but I need my family back. [music throughout] [family laughing and talking] -You girls... -I love you. [music continues] Mrs. K., you're just too tired, that's all. Let's get you to bed. [Spanish] You just need some rest. [Spanish] I just want to go home. You are home. [girls laughing] This is so fun. [voices echo] Hey Olivia want to come and play with me and mom? Hey Mom, can we go up to the park please? I love you mom. I think you're the coolest. So how'd you do on your Global Studies test? Okay I guess. The teacher hates me. She doesn't hate you; she says such good things about on parent night. Potatoes! Wait a second, what is she doing here? Ellie! How many times have we talked about this. No teacher hates you. Did you just call her Ellie? She hates that. You hate that right? Miss Becker hates me; trust me mom. What? Did you just call her mom. Are you kidding me? Why can't anybody hear me? Daddy, can we do that new dance you taught me, again tonight. You know, the Zipperbug? It's Jitterbug sweetie, but daddy always dances with mommy first. This can't be happening! Why can't anybody see me? Why has she stolen my family? [drill noise] Gary? [drill noise] Gary? Lights, lights. It's got that funny sound in it again. Really? Yeah. I bought it used. Janine will kill me if I have to buy another one. So, what does Janine think about you working here? We need the money. Yeah. Yeah. Janine's a great lady. [clears throat] Hi Reg. How you doing Gary? Oh, good, good. You'll tell me if the reindeer are all crooked. I don't want to give you any crooked reindeer. Santa's very meticulous about the reindeer. No, it looks great. I mean, I think the middle one looks like it's ready for takeoff, but... Is that Dasher or Donner, because usually I have trouble with Blitzen. You know what, I'll just straighten the reindeer. How come you put up all these lights at Nick's house and not ours? At ours? At yours. At your house. Well, one I get paid I'll put my lights up at home. I got a little trouble with the drill right now. Reg can't tell if it's the motor or the cable, so... Really? I'm sorry to hear that, but maybe it's a really good time to take a break. And go grab some lunch? Lunch? Yeah, I'm going down to the club. It is so festive there; you would love it. Actually Janine packed me a club sandwich, so that's about the only club I'm gonna taste today. Yeah, but I thought maybe it could be a really good time for us to do some catching up. It's my treat. Nick's treat. Yeah, he's doing pretty well, but I think I'm gonna hang with Reg. Gary, don't you remember when you used to pick me up from work and we'd go have lunch at the Bluffs? Yeah I do, I do remember that. That was a long time ago. I'm just going to Armando's and to do a little shopping. I could be back and pick you up around noon. Uh, noon. I've got a lot of work to do; a lot of work to do, but thank you. Janine made me that sandwich, so that's what I'm going to have. You could drive. Really... Thank you. So what's up? I think she was coming on to me. [music throughout] Olivia! Olivia! Oh god, I'm so sorry. I thought you were somebody else. I didn't mean to scare you, okay? That's quite all right. Come along honey. (Doorbell) Oh, Paula? I was in the neighbourhood. Are you looking for Gary? Yeah, I need to talk to him. Oh, he's not home yet; he had to get something fixed. [laughs] Do you know when he will be home? Is there a problem with the Christmas lights? Yeah, sort of. -Go fish. -Whoa, I have 5 aces. -It's not an ace, it's the joker. -Okay, I'll take it back. -Daddy says the joker mild. -That's wild, but not in this game. You have such a lovely tree. Your turn. Gary probably picked it up off the side of the road. He's so creative that way. But the kids don't care, they're just excited Santa's coming! Right girls? -Too men. -Those are jacks. Hi girls. Say hello to Mrs. Kensington girls. -Hi. -Whatever. -They're mine. -Okay, go fish. -I just did. Thanks. Wat-- Oh! Watch up for the pool of ketchup next to your arm. [phone rings] Mom, if that's Cody I'm not home. Hello, Ferguson Construction here. Ma'am our records indicate you're way past due. Honey, if we could pay you, we would pay everyone else too. Unacceptable... Well, Merry Christmas to you too. Could I use the bathroom? Sure, you'll have to use the kid's bathroom upstairs, the toilet down here is having plumbing issues. It's broken? Of course it is. Okay go fish. Are you looking for the bathroom? OH! Oh my god. I didn't mean to scare you. It's okay. Janine told me that you have something to talk to me about. Yeah, I do. Okay, shoot. Oh, I'm not quite sure how to say this thing. What is it? I miss you Gary. I miss our life together. Our life together? Gary? Do you want your white shirt for tonight? Sure. Paula, that was ancient history. That was high school. No, not really. Are you guys going out? Oh yeah, Janine and I like to go dancing. You know, you used to like to dance. I still do. Well, you know what, you should Nick on the dance floor. We go to this great local place just down the road. In fact, I gotta get changed, otherwise Janine's gonna hit me with a wooden spoon. Gary, I just want you to-- I'm sorry. I just want you to know that I think you're incredibly handy. Nick, he's not so handy. Well, Nick has his talents and I have mine, so if you need anything fixed, I'll be right over in a heartbeat. Did you ever wonder what it would be like if you married somebody else? Like who? Like me? Like you and me? Don't you feel anything for me? Well, Paula, I know about the divorce, and I'm really sorry that you couldn't work things out with Nick. This is so weird, here we are you and me, in our house, with our kids downstairs... You know what, you can't be saying those kinds of things because my family is right downstairs. It sounds a little crazy, but I know that you're not, I know that you're not crazy. Do you want me to bring this shirt up? I'll come and get it honey. I'll tell you what, I'm going to come over tomorrow and I'm going to put up your lights. That way your house is looking great for the Christmas party and I know that will brighten up your day. Is it hard working for Nick? I don't think about it. The kids need things and bills need to be paid, and there's just not a lot of work around Christmas. I'll see you tomorrow. Okay go. Three nines. Okay, my turn. Hey, hey... Hi... Mrs. Kensington. Hi. I'm gonna go. Gotta go rest up for your big Christmas eve party tomorrow night? I hope you two will be there - and you, of course, too Reg. Yeah, Nick already invited us. We'll see. The kids might be tired; we might be tired. I think I have plans. Sorry. Well, no, I mean, you guys have to come. I wouldn't know what to wear. No, it's not like that. Come as you are. You two kids go already. Come on girls, let's get you upstairs to bed. Coming. Night. Goodnight Dad. All right, you ready to go dance? [laughter] Okay then, I gotta go. Hang on. Hey, we'll see you tomorrow; hang in there. Shall we? What was that all about? Problems at home. What's that got to do with you? It's me sweetheart. You have nothing to worry about, so let's go. Mrs. K., are you looking for something? Where's Gary? I don't know. What do you mean? He had a problem with his drill, so he had to go. He says not to worry, the lights still be done in time for the party. [Music] You came back. You came back. I told Martina I wouldn't let you down. I just had to get my drill fixed. Is there anything I can do to help? Come in. I was just afraid that you weren't going to come back, you know. I just felt like maybe you were going leave me here. Please don't leave me here. Leave you here? It's okay. I just really want to come home. I understand. You do? Of course I do. You do? You want me to come home too? I want you to be happy. Yeah, right now I'm happy. That's good. That's good. You know what I want? I really just want you to kiss me. I can't. Here's the thing Paula. I made a choice a long time ago. And? And I'm happy with that. Right. Right. Choices. Right. Paula, I'm sorry. I'm taken. I don't think I can get out the way I came in, so... if you'll excuse me. Mrs. Kensington, what are you doing? What are you doing? Oh, I'm not Mrs. Kensington, I'm Mrs. Ferguson! You're not okay. What's really bothering you? Oh, everything. My life is so empty. Here I am, finally, with all this money, and it means nothing. Why am I so miserable? Because life without love, it is not worth anything. Yeah, that's true. I know. I have love in my life. You do? Yeah. I've been married for 23 years with Carlos and we have raised three boys and I'm a grandmother too. You are? You raised three boys? How come I didn't know this? You never ask. Oh, I'm sorry Martina. I should have asked you about your life. Was I good to you? You've been nice. I make a nice life with my family, my boys are happy. That's what's important. Yeah, I made a nice life with my family once too, and I just let it go. Now I want it back. All of it! But I don't know how to get back through the dryer. Do you know that I have two little girls? I didn't know that. And Gary and I, we've been married for 18 years. Mr. Ferguson, the light man? Yeah. And now my biggest fear is that I'm going to be stuck here in this world and I'm never going to get my old one back. I miss my little girls. I miss them, and I miss everything. It was really good, you know; it was good. And Gary and I, we really love each other. Mrs. K. I need to call Dr. Degolia, okay? I'm going to go shopping. I just need to make sure that they both get to this address. This one needs to have Eleanor's name on it and this one, this one is Olivia. Do you want to include a gift card? Um, no. No gift card. I need you to make sure that they get there tonight, though. On Christmas Eve? Please? Of course, Mrs. Kensington. I'll personally see to it that they arrive tonight. Promise? I'll take care of it. Merry Christmas to you. Yes, right, American Express... Right, same address, for Gary Ferguson. And that's the high speed cordless drill. Right, and make sure he gets an extra battery and a super charger. No, I know, I need it on Christmas - it's a Christmas gift. It will be there tonight, right? Okay, thank you. Ho Ho Ho. Merry Christmas! Ho Ho Ho, holy mackerel! Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas to you. [Music] White wine? Fabulous decorations, ample food, and decent drink. You'd never know. Best divorce party I've been to on a Christmas Eve. Poor Paula. And where is she? No sign of her. Seen plenty of Sheila though. Living room, far corner. I feel like people are staring at me. So what, It's my party and I want you here. The timing might look odd. The timing is perfect. In an hour and a half, I'll be a free man. You don't want me to get snaffled up by someone else, do you? I do not. I want you all to myself. If I were Paula I'd make sure I got the Condo. She'll land on her feet. I know her. Your guests are here. They're wondering where you are. Is Gary here? Everybody else is here, but no, Mr. Ferguson is not here. You should come down and greet your guests. I don't really have anything to say. Well, just say Merry Christmas; thank you for coming; I like your dress; try the crab cakes. [music and chatter throughout] Thank you for coming. I love your dress. [chatter continues] Oh Paula! Oh... have you tried to crab cake? No, should I? I don't know. I don't know; Martina told me to say that. You know, I want to tell you that I hope that you and Nick are actually really very happy together. Really? That's good of you to say. I was never right for him. I'm sure he told you that. I think you will be. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Excuse me. For you. Oh. This is too beautiful! Do you like them? This is too much. No, no it isn't. Gosh, you're such a good friend to me. You deserve these. No, this is too much money. It's not enough money. You're always there for me. You deserve these. Merry Christmas. Gracias. He's not coming. You never know when a door will open. He's not coming. Paula? Hi! I didn't think you were going to come. Here. For me? You didn't have to do that. Better not be expensive. Trust me, it's not. [Music] How did you know? You've been so unhappy lately; I though this will make you smile. Paula? Paula? -Mommy, wake up! -Mom, are you okay? -Paula? -I think she's waking up! -Mom wake up! Mom, are you okay? Mommy, Mommy! We were so worried about you! Hi. Hi! I missed you guys so much. I missed you guys so much! Let me see you. Mommy, Mommy, come upstairs. Look at the tree. Okay, let's do that. No place like home huh? There's no place like home. I'll tell you what, come on, let's see that tree. I love the tree. [doorbell] [door closes] Who can these be from, huh? Look! Open them, open them! There's no name on the tag. Me either. These are awesome! Whoever they are, this is exactly what I wanted. Maybe it's from Santa. But he forgot to get one for you mommy. I don't need one. I have everything I want, right here. I think I can fix that. This is for you. You've been so unhappy lately, I thought this would make you smile. It's exactly what I wanted! [Music] I love you, you know that? ? Jingle bells, Jingle bells, jingle all the way. ? Put this one on the tree girls. ? Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh. ? ?
