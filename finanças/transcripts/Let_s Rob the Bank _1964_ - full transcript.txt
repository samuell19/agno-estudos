VICTOR GARNIER FISHING AND HUNTING Mr Garnier. Hello. Isabelle, I'll be right back. FINANCE COMPANY DURAND-MAREUIL You did well to follow my advice. Money should be productive, as they say. With the Tangana mines you don't run any risk. Progress has been constant and they just discovered two new layers. Thanks to me... you buy very cheaply. In 6 months, you'll double your money. Mr Durand-Mareuil, drown me in Tangana shares. SURPRISE AT STOCK EXCHANGE TANGANA SHARES TAKE DIVE TANGANA SHARES COLLAPSE TANGANA SHARES WORTHLESS I'm not convinced. Don't you have something else? Yes, the door. The door. - This is a first for me. Come here more often then. - You'll never see me here again. Even better. You're exaggerating, dad. - You stick to the fish hooks. And don't mix them up. Hello, dad. - Hello. I'm broke. - Me too. Can't you get some from our reserve? - Are you finished? He's right. He always gets his pocket money on Monday. His pocket money? What about me? I've been robbed. You've been robbed? - Yes. That's all I'm saying. Good morning. I'm off. I'm getting a haircut. I'm out of money, by the way. - That's bad timing today. Victor, give me the household money. I'll look after things. Why not? Do as you please: beauty parlour, jazz music, caviar. We're lucky Corinne plays the violin. - Why? For when we'll be street performers. Victor, your coffee! - No. How are you? - Mr Durand-Mareuil. This is Victor Garnier. He sells the best rifles in Paris. The best. He can recommend a suitable rifle. Don't always believe everything. - He was unlucky with his Tangana shares. Very. It's a disaster. - Who could know they'd nationalize? You, maybe. Dear, in spite of my competence, I don't know everything. Where's that rifle? - Of course. You'll see. There. - It's for pigeons, right? Pigeons are hard to hit. Just when you think you've got one, it poops on your head. That's disgusting. - Absolutely. This is a beauty. Chrome interior. Perfect edges. It clicks into position. Automatic eject... quadruple locking, 3 kilos. For you: 5,700 francs. I don't want to hurt you. - Isn't that a bit expensive? You have to keep money moving. Yesterday it was with you. Now with me. That's how it goes. Is it easy to charge? - Very easy. It's ready for use. - It's for you, darling. You spoil me, Andr?. Where do you get all that money? With the Tangana mine, you don't run any risk... You don't run any risk... NUMBER OF UNRESOLVED ROBBERIES INCREASES I'll show you out. Thank you, sir. Goodbye, sir. Don't forget to pay the rent. - It's all I'm thinking about. And Winchester's invoice. And Candeli's. And remember Thomas? I'm not forgetting. And that is why we should not confuse goodness with weakness. We have to be vigilant and firm in our faith. And therefore we have to be strong and firm... in guiding the erring sheep back to the flock... because we are God's soldiers. I'll give an example. A man comes to you... with bad intentions. He betrays your trust... and robs you shamelessly. You could say "take what you want, what's mine is yours". But if there is evil in that man, do not encourage him to... become more and more evil. And to slowly lose his soul. Isn't the salvation of his soul most important? Therefore, it is clear how we should behave. We shall try to retrieve our property in the most discrete way possible. And then we shall make him see the error of his ways. And, finally, we shall forgive him, as God would... when he shows remorse for his sins. This way, he will understand what none of us can ever forget... that ill-gotten gains never prosper. So be it. We'll do it. - What, daddy? A robbery. - A robbery? We'll rob a bank. - Not in front of the children, Victor. I have to confess something. We've lost all our savings. The reserve, as G?rard calls it. - How? Gone. - Gone? The bastard knew the mine was going to be nationalized. He abused my trust. Do you know what he did with my money? With our money? I'll show you. Look. Stop. Time for revenge. Agreed? You bet, daddy. It's disgusting. - No, G?rard, it's shameful. I have no more clothes and he's spending our money. He shouldn't have done that, but... - What does the priest say? Nothing about a robbery. I'll get back what's mine. And I'll save a soul from perdition. You can't just rob a bank. - We've got plenty of guns. No, I can't stand the sight of blood. - We'll only scare them a bit. And we'll steal a getaway car. - Yes. Isn't there a money transport every Saturday? -Yes. We'll corner them and rob them. - That fails seven out of ten times. They got Joseph le Camarguais that way. - They did? Dad, we can hide before closing time and let them lock us in. Through the ceiling. The apartment above is empty. With an umbrella, I suppose? That trick's really old. You're getting on my nerves. - Why don't we dig a tunnel? The bank's across the road. - We'll strike from below. Continue. - Right, mummy. That rarely fails. Safe-deposit boxes are in the basement. - No problems with an alarm. We'll do it at night. - With a cutting torch. And I'll get back what that bastard stole from me. It's going to be a big job. - I'll help. And then we'll blow up the tunnel to remove any traces. How do you know all that? - "Moles go hunting", page 109. Let me kiss you. And I have to check what books you read. Sir? Don't be afraid. It was an accident. He already left. What are you doing here? - I'm just doing my job. Don't ever mop this floor again. Clean the chandelier in the living room. That's new. Too much routine gives you sclerosis. - Sclerosis? Are we done, dad? - No, we'll start again. To the basement. That's it. Stay here. When we're inside, give us a discrete signal. I need these totals this afternoon. Yes, Director. Garnier. - Mr Durand-Mareuil. Everything alright? - Yes. Your daughter? - Yes. Your gun caused a massacre, last Sunday. Laura was delighted. I'm going duck hunting on Saturday. I want... can you recommend... some bird whistles? Isn't that your son? - Where? No. Yes, indeed. He's quite a rascal. - Why is he jumping like that? What was that? - Why is he jumping like that? Yes, he jumps. Yes, why does he jump? It runs in the family. Really? - It runs in the family. When I was his age, I was jumping all the time too. I'd jump for a juice or for a school paper. I'd jump for a date in spring or a watery November sun. Don't you mind that people don't jump much anymore? I don't know. - I think you're a jumper. Oh no. - I thought so. Why do you say that? - No reason. I'm actually here... to warn you for a possible flooding. A flooding? How's that? And have you had that water problem in the basement for long? I only discovered it yesterday. That's why I'm warning you. There are things in a bank that shouldn't get wet. Thanks, I'll have a look. - I think it could happen here. What's under here? - The safe-deposit boxes. You'll soon be swimming in money then. Very funny. But we have nothing to fear. The walls are thick and strong. A bit of water could never... That's what they all say. - I don't mind showing you the basement. So you can see our clients don't need to worry. Can my daughter come? She's interested. - Of course. She's so charming. Follow me. Gerber, have you got a moment? Can you open the safe-deposit box room for us? Excuse me, sir. - Madam? I'd like some information. - What about? How do I open an account or rent a safe-deposit box? Go to the last counter. - Thank you. Hello, miss. - Hello, sir. I'm Philippe Br?cy. - Isabelle Garnier. I know. I often see you across the road. I know. - I'm in training here. Is that all? - After I've had all the departments... I'll be able to get a job as a board member. What can I do for you? - Mr future Director... I want to rent a safe-deposit box. - That's not a problem. Only if your bank's safe. With all the robberies lately. How has your bank been secured? As you can see, it's dry here. - Yes, at first sight. But have you checked the walls? Thank God our basement isn't as old as yours. God moves in mysterious ways. Even in this basement. Our client's money is as safe as the treasure of the Knights Templar. They say it was dug up. No, thanks. Dug up with a little can. That takes time of course. And sometimes one is in a hurry. This is very strong, isn't it? - Brick with a thick layer of concrete. Concrete? - Of course. That changes things. Wait. Were we above this point earlier? Yes, exactly here. - And it's not leaking? No. - You're lucky. Because my basement's there. - Just about. No, wait. We were there earlier. Indeed. - And now we're here. Yes. - And my basement's there. Yes. - Exactly across from that. It's perfectly straight. - But there's also the height. Because you're lower than we are. That's why you don't have any water. Because the height's very important. Daddy, I've seen it all. Can I go? - Of course. You know the way. She's cute. The vault door. - Let's see. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16... I shouldn't tell you this. - Then why do you? Guess. After all you've said, I think my money's safe here. You wouldn't want to rob this bank. You have to fill in a form. One moment. We'll start here and we'll end up here. How far is that? -12 metres and a bit. And a bit? I need to know exactly. I wrote it down. - Hurry up. I've got it. 12.4 metres. Plus the walls themselves. Sugar everybody? - Yes, sugar. We have to do one to one and a half metres per day. At least. - That's a lot, Victor. It's possible. Our invoices expire on the 30th. How high is our basement? -2.80 metres. 2.80. And their basement? Quick. 28 steps of 16 centimetres. 4.48 metres, daddy. 4.48. So we'll end up at 2.7 metres above floor level. We'll need a ladder. - I'll write it down. If the distance between A and B is 12.4 metres... the height of C is 2.8 metres and the height of D is 4.48 metres... how old is the commissioner who'll arrest us? Isabelle, you know I'm superstitious. - Tell us what you found out. An electric alarm on all the exits, the safe-deposit boxes and the vault. The night watchman does the rounds every 2 hours. He's a good shot. You find that funny? - He'll be fired for sleeping at the job. The alarm system won't work because of a short circuit. Between us, of course. - Here, get a haircut. And the money truck? Arrival 3.40 PM. Departure 3.48 PM. And it looked full. Good, we'll make a lot of money. To bed. We'll start tomorrow. The girls will stay in the shop. Time for action. This is the biggest one we have. - Hold it. It's very heavy. - It depends what you want to do with it. It's to dig a tunnel. No, to dig a well in the countryside. A garage next to a hill. - With that it will go faster. Sold. Give me three of them. What have we got? 1 ladder, 2 extension cords, 3 lamps, 4 hammers, 1 kilo of nails... 3 chisels, 6 batteries, 5 helmets and 3 pickaxes. That's not a garage, but a whole petrol station. Will you build it together? If you're not rich, you have to be resourceful. What's next? That's about it. Let me think... Do you sell bars? Yes, flat bars, cutting bars or English bars? Parrot. A parrot bar. My husband means a crowbar. - Just a word joke. Follow me. Did you think you were a bulldozer? - Excuse me, officer. I'll fix it. It's not broken. - Keep your hands off it. It's a nice bike. - Your papers. Hold this. - Yes, sir. What are you transporting? - Just junk. Officer, we have far to go and our lights aren't working. What was that? - You know very well. You should have had it fixed. But why tell the policeman? You can pay the fine. You might get more than one. Officer, I also haven't paid road tax. My God. Are you injured? - That was close. Did it cave in? - Who uses parquet to support a ceiling? You did, dad. - Don't stay here. You'll suffocate. I need a specialist. - A lung specialist? No, a construction specialist. What kind of digging is that? Who recommended you? And I'll get the blame. Come on, start digging. It's not lunch time. I'll confiscate your lunch box. Unbelievable. Can you believe that? Sorry to interrupt. It's quite a job, isn't it? It's the workers, sir. Always with their hands in their pockets. They only take them out to accept an allowance. They're not bad guys, but they're not very fast. Did you ever do any indoor digging? - Indoor? What do you mean? Under the ground. - You mean in a basement? Exactly. - Like a mine shaft? Exactly. - Yes, I've done that. But why do you ask? - Because I want to dig a hole. A shaft? - Yes, but in this direction. A horizontal shaft? - Exactly. And why? - For my wife's birthday. Your wife likes horizontal shafts? I want to build Ali Baba's cave for her. But a smaller version. My son helps me after his work. Your wife's lucky. Come with me. Sit down there. After you. Glass of wine? - No, thanks. Just to toast. It's good stuff. My cousin's a winegrower. To your wife's health. You don't drink this every day. Thank God. Where do you want to dig? What kind of material? The usual. - That doesn't help. Is it slate, chalk, clay? - A bit of everything. Right, a bit of everything. Is it firm or crumbly? More crumbly. - That's a pity. It needs to be supported well. Yes, or else the birthday might turn out to be a burial. No problem. A bit more? - No, thanks. A bit then. First empty your glass. Go on. You need 23 boards or even 41 boards. You need pine wood for the sides and mine cribs. And bears. If it's soft you need soles too. We have boots. - No. Soles. When you say 41 boards, do you mean 1941? No, not the year. The thickness. And you mentioned bears. What will they do underground? You don't understand. We'll have to teach you everything. Alright. To our women, our horses... - I know how it continues. and all those who ride them. Pull that support bear. - I'm pulling. No that's the pine wood. Come on, up. Let go. Let it go. Up again! Go work there. Get that pickaxe. It's stuck, dad. It's the workers fault, indeed. Siesta's over. Come on. Close that hole. Quickly. Hello. Hello. - Hello. I'm fine. You too? Isabelle too. Great, no? - Don't pay any attention to her. She's reached puberty. Why are you here? To see you. The Director's very busy. He's looking for a bird whistle for wild ducks. So I offered to help. - I'll show you what we have. Flooding. That's all we needed. Push harder. - Dad, this won't help. I said push! - Alright. Get sticky tape from the shop. Hurry. We've got different types. - What are they for? To imitate the call of your prey. This is a curlew, for instance. And this? There are big problems downstairs. - This gentleman works at the bank. The Director sent him. - Hello, sir. Nice to meet you, madam. - He's charming. What would Mr Durand-Mareuil like? - A bird whistle for wild ducks. We can hardly refuse. - Do you have household problems? Maybe I can be of service? - No, thank you very much. I mean you're very charming, isn't he? - Yes. Eliane! What is she doing? Here. Push hard. Push, son. The things people do for money. Where's that sticky tape? This isn't working. Victor, this gentleman works at the bank. Hello, sir. - I recognize you. Excuse me. - He needs a bird whistle for wild ducks. Then you're lucky. Nobody quacks like we do. Help! Is anybody ill? - No. Why? That's my son who's rehearsing. He's practicing with his voice. He wants to be an actor. - Yes, he'll be in the church play. Hurry up. I can't go much longer. Is he practicing in the basement? - It's the same setting. He plays the Count of Monte Cristo. - And dad plays Father Faria. Help! Help me! Shouldn't you go and reply? - Yes. Nice to meet you, but now I have to go. You have nice parents. Quite a family. They're real accomplices. Hello? Who? G?rard? He's very busy. Is it urgent? Alright, I'll have a look. What was your name? One moment. G?rard, telephone. It's Mireille. I'm coming. Wait, I'll keep my hand on it. He's coming. I can hear his heartbeat from here. Go play somewhere else. Yes? Good. And you? What? Of course I'm coming. It's my first surprise party. Everyone's coming. It's going to be cool. I'm counting on you, darling. Promised? Bye. And that's it. - See, darling? At moments like this, a couple shows its strength. We'll get them, sweetheart. Miss Garnier. Isabelle. - No, Mr Br?cy. Philippe. Not now. Why not? - So much can happen. I'll never let you go. - You don't know that, Philippe. I'm very sure. Corinne, you're terrible. Now I really hate you. And she plays out of tune too. I'll do it for you. I don't harbour a grudge. We should have checked with the council. - And asked for an engineer? If we have to go through that, we might get cholera. We'll go around. 3 degrees to the left. That's north. No, yes, that's north. Now the deviation from our target. That way. I didn't know you sold party articles. What do you mean? You may think it's funny, but I call it an abuse of trust. What do you mean? - Listen to this. Does that sound like a duck? - We'll solve this right away. I had to treat everyone to champagne because I didn't shoot anything. Don't you pop corks all the time? How would you know? - Intuition. A duck? - Try this one. Junk. - Blow a bit harder. I think you're behaving very inappropriately. And what about you? - If I tell people, you'll jump higher... than your son. - Don't challenge me... because I can destroy you. - How's that? Director, your foreign colleagues. - I'm coming. Never mind. I'll go to Courgelot tonight. Courgelot. His ducks sound like crows. I won't accept this. You don't know what you're selling and he doesn't know what he's buying. What are you thinking? I don't want to know. Next time you confuse an eagle with a goose... I'll send you to our cousin in Issoudun. I'm sorry. It's my fault. - I don't understand what happened. It's up to the customer to check the products. Are you angry? - No, you should be... Alright, I'm off to the bank. See you soon. Bye. Isa, I swapped the whistles. I'm sorry. You're crazy about each other. - You bet. You won't find that at Courgelot's. Listen. Some other time. Can't you see I'm busy? Just a moment. Listen well. The teal. And the garganey. Excuse me, this is a supplier. - And a friend, I hope? Very good. I'll drop by soon. There's no difference. - What do you mean? There's no difference. - You're tone-deaf. If he says there's no difference... Gentlemen, excuse me. Do you happen to have the turnstone? I can't find it in Glasgow. - You mean the Arenaria interpres? The big stilt-walker of the sandbanks? - Yes. Black and white with a white spot. On the head. - On the tail. Like a sandpiper. But bigger. Much bigger. I'll let you hear it. It sounds like this. No. - It has to be this one. No. - Can I? Silence, please. Listen. That's an oystercatcher. The oystercatcher. - Is this a joke? Yes. He laughs best who laughs last. Who are they? - The Directors. They? - Yes. Hello, ladies. We're delivering coal. We know the way. Those bastards. - Mind your language. They blow all my whistles and then Durand-Mareuil takes them to Courgelot. That's enough reason to rob his bank. Where's G?rard? - Downstairs. I already called him. Is he sleeping? - That's not fair, daddy. He did 0.70 cubic metres more than you yesterday. Where is he? G?rard! G?rard! G?rard! What happened here? G?rard, my God. My son, my child. My little boy. What did they do to you? Come here. Lay there. How do you feel? How are you? - I'm alright. We should have had gas heating. What's happening? - Did it cave in? Yes, the coal did. - So they delivered it. They dumped two tons of coal on my son and that's all you have to say? We've got a hero in the family. He's so dirty. - Clean that up right away. What about the dirt? - What about it? What do we do with all that dirt? - And this is only the beginning. I calculated it. - Couldn't you say so earlier? We forgot something important. It's true. We underestimated it. - We only just started. It'll be alright. Do we still have the sacks from the war? - Yes, but they're relics. Right, and we need a miracle. What are Isabelle and Corinne doing? It's going much too slowly. Come on. Here, mummy. Are there many more? - Enough for the whole night. We'll get rid of them. Who filled up that trench again? Bastards. You didn't do anything while I was at the dentist's. Get your pickaxes. I won't take this. Good, Abdou. At least he likes to work. My lunch box. They buried it. There was still some sausage in it. You bring bad luck. MIREILLE'S PARTY What's wrong? You're not tired already? Get up you! What did you do last night? - You don't want to know. I can guess. No, I'm telling you straight. I'm fed up. I already lost Mireille and this way I won't find anyone else. Be quiet and hurry up. - Who transports dirt in suitcases? Those bags stood out too much. - Do Corsicans rob a bank like this? He's right. In that movie about... - We're not in the cinema here. It's quite hard work. - So? I make my own cartridges. I repair guns myself. I assemble my own rods and I'll also make sure justice prevails. Just like St. Louis. We're lucky. Victor, aren't we overdoing things? I'm being robbed, bullied and exploited. They hurt my pride and go to Courgelot. And I'm the one who's overdoing it? I'll do it on my own. Victor, you know we'll never let you down. Mr Character. - Come on, dad. Don't you have anything to say? I have nothing to lose, so why not? Wait a moment. Eliane, Victor! We've arrived, children. Victor, our cousins from Li?ge. Just what we needed. Hello, children. - Are you going on a trip? No. We're closed on Mondays, so we wanted to go on a picnic. At least you won't starve. We could eat a horse. Did you come from Belgium? - No, we're back from the Costa Brava. That's quite a drive. - Come in with those children. Cold, isn't it? That weather comes from the Netherlands. I hope we're not interrupting. - Not at all. You're at home here. Great, Victor! What do we do now? - I don't know. Shall we get them out again? No, are you crazy? Not while they're still here. There are many more. - Come. We went to Spain for the sun, but it hasn't rained this much in ages. We crossed the Pyrenees. There was snow and ice on the roads. A real ice rink. - Put the suitcase there. Casimir went via Lourdes, to see the grotto. And his wallet was stolen there. It's a disgrace to steal there, isn't it? G?rard, continue the stock-taking. The stock-taking in the basement. But not on my own. - Go work on the stock-taking. Listen, you can't... - Yes, yes, son. It's a disaster. Did you see Isabelle and Corinne? They're almost real women. Children grow up so fast. - Where are yours, by the way? Where are your children? Albert! Arthur! Look, a tunnel. Arthur! Albert! Arthur! Albert! Where are they? Arthur! Albert! No. Stay here. Get out. Or I'll throw some coal at you. You have no business there. Why can't we see your tunnel? - What tunnel? There is no tunnel. That's all made up! There was a big hole in the wall. - They say... When was the Battle of Waterloo? - In 1515. See, they don't know a thing. - Why won't he show us... the tunnel? - Leave cousin Victor in peace. We did it, daddy. - Your helmet. Stock-taking's almost finished. - It's a big job, isn't it? Can I help? - No, thanks. Can't you be more discrete? - We're there. Where? - At the wall of the bank. That's impossible! - Come have a look. If Elaine can make us some food, we'll keep going after that. Have you recovered? - He wants to keep driving. It's crazy. There's nothing like your own bed. - Your own ditch, you mean. You can go much faster at night. And you get through customs fast. If we're imposing, just say so. Of course not. The little ones have to go to bed. Where are the little darlings? Are they sleeping? No, we're doing like you. We're digging a tunnel. Are you able to drive? A man like Casimir's never tired. He's in good shape. I remember seeing him dance until 6 in the morning. Remember blonde Lulu? - Have you got a screw loose? When was that? - I can't even remember. He surprised me the most with the two big German girls. Do you know what he did? - No! We're leaving. Good. Then you can tell me everything about that Lulu. I'll get you. Can you help me out though? With your car? - No, with Lourdes. They stole my wallet. - Ah, yes, they did. Here, is that enough? - If nothing unforeseen happens. You're right. Family comes first. Go sleep in a hotel. Duty calls. Be careful. - How far are we? We're there. It's going to happen. - Hurry, darlings. Arthur? Albert? Where are you? - I'll walk you to the car. Is everything ready? - Yes. Three loads. Shall we light them? - Let me do it. Stand behind me. Careful, dad. - Don't worry. Don't you think he acted strange? - Just give me a waffle. Give me that lamp. - I'm thinner. Hello, miss. A telegram for you. Thank you. - Bye. Bye. Aunt Marie died. Funeral tomorrow in Loud?ac. If course it's sad, but she was 94 and we never saw her. I know, but I have to go. And so do the children. She was a half sister of grandma. - So we send the children to Loud?ac? What would people think? People from Loud?ac rarely come to our shop. Shouldn't I stay here to help dad? Won't he be alright until tomorrow evening? Yes. Hello. I'd like to surprise my husband. What do you recommend? I'd hide one of the Bluebell Girls in his bed. How rude! - Madam. Brother, tomorrow will be too late. You're right, brother. - Follow the right path, brother. Straight to the target. That's my slogan. Brother. Hello, Mr Garnier. - You again. Am I interrupting? - Yes, very much so. I like you, though. - Don't you confuse me with my daughter? Of course. I mean I like her a lot. I asked her out for dinner. - She's gone to a funeral. At this hour? It's far away, in Loud?ac. So they've already left. A close relative? - No, a distant aunt. Good. I mean... - I understand. Allow me. Since your daughter isn't here. The last wildflowers of the season. I hope she'll like them. Say, what do you do at the bank? - I have good prospects. It's a reliable company. - Reliable indeed... Excuse me. I'm on my own and I have a lot of work, May I offer you a dinner? - No. So we can talk a bit. - No, don't insist. It's closed. - I'll open it. Are you alright? - Good night, Mr Garnier. Have a nice evening. - You too. I hope nothing happened. Look. You're right. Normally, they open at nine. I knocked ten times on the back door. And nobody opened the door. - What's going on? The Garniers aren't opening. Maybe there's a gas leak. That's strange. - Hurry. Quickly. What do you want? - We were worried. You weren't opening. There was so much noise last night. I though I heard explosions. I'm working on a new gunpowder mix for my firecrackers. It must be dirty work. - Does that mean it's forbidden? Is everything alright? - Fine. Thanks for asking. Right, where do I start? - By going home. Come back next week. I'm doing the stock-taking, so were closed. We're closed for stock-taking, like each year. We'll let you know. Don't worry. Make firecrackers in the middle of the night? It's not like him. I know them a bit after six years. - So you're not surprised? When he acts like this, it's for a reason. Did he say that to you? - Yes, madam. To me. To me, who hasn't had a lover for 25 years. The oaf. I wouldn't be surprised if he had money problems. That would explain it. If you ask me, his wife's cheating on him. He's able to kick his children out and maybe his wife, after a fight... They have life insurance. If one dies, the other one makes a lot of money. It has to look like an accident, of course. It's not that hard when you work with weapons all day. Now that you mention it. I saw him with a big sack the other day. Shall we tell the police? - What do you want with the police? If we listened to gossip, we could arrest everybody. Lefebvre, check this out. Investigate in the neighbourhood. Right, boss. - Why do you think they disappeared? Because they're no longer there, commissioner. Maybe they left for a while. -24 hours already. And he locked himself in his shop. - Without any explanation? Not much. And he yelled at his customers. He locked himself in his shop and lights firecrackers in his basement. And he sent the cleaning lady away. - We'll go have a look. Careful. He's violent. - Witnesses? Me. He threw my bike on the ground violently. He hasn't paid road tax and is proud of it. We'll see into it later. I have no people available now. Maybe I can go? I applied to become an inspector. If you wish. But don't be stupid. He's a hard working taxpayer. If I discover something, will my application be... looked at favourably. But be discrete. You can count on me, commissioner. Bye. In the name of the law, open up! I'm coming! Make room. Officer. - Remember me? Of the bike? It's a small world. - I paid my road tax. That's history. I was in a bad mood as well. Yes, it's the times we live in. - Enforcing the law is no joy. With all the robberies. And I'm not even mentioning men who kill their wives. Out of jealousy. Or for financial gain. Sometimes both. - Times are strange, aren't they? Is your wife alright? - She's fine. Thank you. The children too? - Yes, they're all fine. How can I help you, officer? Do you sell fish hooks? - Yes. What for? I'm only interested in big fish. They're smart and suspicious, but they're worth it. They put up a fight but you get them in your net. You need number 14. - Why is your shop closed? For stock-taking. And because of the funeral. Is the funeral near here? In Brittany. I thought it would be closer. - Why? No reason. Do you use this for stock-taking? - Sometimes I garden a bit too. You have no garden and no dirt. - No dirt? Just enough to enjoy myself. In the basement? And are things growing a bit? I'm waiting for the harvest. - In the dark? Wearing a helmet? Do you think I'm stupid? I'll tell you everything, officer. But I hope it stays between us. I grow Parisian mushrooms. You can make a big profit underground. Show me your basement. - Why? I want to see your basement! - What for? Your wife or your basement. One or the other. You don't have the right. - My shift's over. I do what I want. Is your wife in the basement? - No, she's in Loud?ac. We'll see about that. Show me your basement. Hurry. What's happening here? - It must have caved in. Dad! Are you alright? - Fine. Look. I think we'd better go. - I can finally get some sleep. What do you want, sir? - He wants to know how you are. That's very kind. - You're welcome. Sorry to interrupt. Do you recognize my wife? See that she's still alive? Tell him you're still alive. - Of course I am. What's this about? He thought you weren't. Wait for me upstairs. Upstairs. It's a misunderstanding. People were making things up. You'll pay for this. Dearly. I'm sorry. I have three children. - Me too. And a wife I love. And you come here to accuse me. Show me your number. Don't make it worse. - I'll pay the fine myself. And who restores my honour? - I'll tell people. Promised. Do you swear? - Yes. And next time they accuse you of something, I'll defend you. And will they believe you? I'm almost inspector. Don't ruin my chances. Inspector? - Yes. Alright, just this once. But be careful in the future. Thank you, Mr Garnier. - You won't forget this, will you? You can count on me. Inspector. That could be useful. Did he really kill his wife? Look. I could hug you. - Check the other side first. Maybe we're in the hallway next door. - No, I'm sure. The safe-deposit boxes are there. What time is it? Five past twelve. Chisel, crowbar, cutting torch. Is everything ready? Give me. Victor, I'm very afraid. - I'm scared too, children. We've waited more than 10 days for this moment. This is the moment of revenge and I know I can count on you. Yes, Victor. - Chisel away! The big hammer. Quickly. Isn't Isabelle back from the movies yet? - Monique's a real chatterbox. I love you, Isabelle. Take it easy. I have to go home. - Why? Are you tired? Not at all, but my parents are waiting for me. What if we went dancing? I don't feel like sleeping. Me neither. We won't be back late, will we? - It's up to you. I have to ask. Come. Do you want a drink? - No, thanks. Don't you think your father... - Are you afraid of him? No. But he must be asleep. He works late these days. Wait here. I'll be right back. Watch your fingers. - Hello. You're almost there. Where have you been? - At the movies. With Monique? - Yes. On the way back I bumped into... Philippe! Betrayed by my own daughter. Bravo. I can't help that he followed me. I heard you call out and I thought you'd hurt yourself. Sorry to interrupt. - No problem. You're always welcome. We wanted to ask if we can go dancing. Of course. Go dance. Forgive my indiscretion, but what's the tunnel for? This? This is a shooting range. - To try out weapons. We still have to put up a target. - But you're taking down the wall? We need enough room for the cannons. You sell cannons? - Yes. Defensive cannons. Go have fun. - What are you waiting for? But do you do all this yourself? We can't afford a contractor. We have to think of the children. I'd like to be part of such a family. - Not right away. Let me. - You'll get dirty. I don't mind. If we don't go, I'll go to sleep. I'll have a look. - Stop him. The vault. The vault! This is not the room with the safe-deposit boxes. Wrong again. The vault. With the gold bars. The gods are smiling upon us. Let me through. This can't be true. You're not planning to... Isabelle, they're insane. They've lost their mind. Dear boy, this is a turning point in your life. Think before you answer. Are you with us or against us? That's not fair, Mr Garnier. - This is the hour of truth. I beg you not to do this. I'm asking for your daughter's hand. Prove you're worthy of this family. This way. Follow me if you love me... You can't do this. I beg you not to do this. This is theft. - Yes, but you've robbed us. Me? - The Director. Same thing. If you don't help us, you're with him and we have nothing more to discuss. You who give us our daily bread... return to us what was stolen from us. And may the erring sheep return to the flock and be remorseful for its sins. This is crazy. The tunnel leads straight here. Don't worry, darling. It will all be taken care of. That's the 6th one that's not working. - Relax. Give me another one. - Everything's wet. It won't work. The bank opens at nine. - Leave me in peace. When the police come, I'll be dead. Too late. There's nothing we can do. We're history. They'll find out. Eliane, get my suitcase. And add a blanket. It's cold in jail. Children, be strong. It was not to be. Look after them, son. And hide the loot so it wasn't all for nothing. So I'll know they're well looked after. That's strange. Are you sure they won't notice? - Certain. Ask what you want and I'll give it. What would you like? The gold bars. - You're joking. The bank hasn't opened yet. - What are you doing? I'm returning everything. - No way. They're mine. You know that's not true. Give me. Give me! What's this? - That's lead. Lead! Hello. Everything alright? Not at all. Thief. Bastard. Fraud. You thought you'd got me again. But I've got you. I don't know what you're on about. - This! Is that gold? Where did that come from? - Your basement. I demand an explanation. That's the limit! - He's joking. Not at all! Well? Accusing me of this is as stupid as saying you robbed my bank. We've both got nothing to win. Do we? Well. I was joking Mr Durand-Mareuil. - See? How can I help you? - A box of cartridges. Nine. If it's not too much trouble? -12 or 16 millimetres? 16 millimetres. It's not too much to ask, is it? I didn't hit you, did I? With those cartridges. I think we should name Philippe Br?cy our representative. He won't check the reserve until half a year from now... so we have time to fix things. Some repairs here and there. - He'll be in charge of long-term loans. And you could take out a loan too, dear friend. In the meantime, I'd like them to go on a honeymoon... to the Balearic Islands. But... I hear hotels have lead roofs there. Let's dig into this idea a bit more. They're exploding, dad!
