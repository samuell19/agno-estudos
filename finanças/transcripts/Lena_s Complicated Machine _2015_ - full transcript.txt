The world is a place of never ending sorrow. We've become ghosts even before we've died. Floating about as if time was infinite. Concerning ourselves only with things that don't matter in the end. But here is what I know to be true. Love exists when we choose it. I loved you from the moment our eyes crossed. And when our lips first met. From the first time you hugged me tightly, and inhaled my musk. I loved you, from the moment our eyes crossed. And when our lips first met. The first time you hugged me tightly and inhaled my musk. I.. can never tell what's good or what isn't with poetry. It seems to just all float over my head. It's like with any writing. If the words connect with you emotionally, it's good. What do you do? I'm a neuroengineer. I get a paycheck every two weeks from my job after college. It's not everyday that I met a neuroengineer. I'll consider your offer. How do I get to a yes? How about we keep talking. We'll see where it takes us. Now from prostheses my research from segued into a field called whole brain emulation. In WBD, he have to assume that brain activity is computable therefore it can be replicated mathematically. There are three basic requirements to emulation is the capability to scan the brain, interpret the data and software to simulate the brain model. I'm working on a brain scanner. In fact, I have the prototype here. Pull up H0351. You look absolutely beguiled. What are you working on? Some calculations. What kinda calculations? I'm really trying to get this done. Just the other day as we were returning from dinner, I thought that the first declaration of love should be followed by a compact in which lovers pledge to be bold, courageous and daring. The work is being fearless in the face of personal history and daring to imagine a transcendent life. A life outside the shadows of suffering. A life untethered. A spirit free to rise. Hello? It's Sophie. Hello. I got it. Coffee? Yes, please. I brought some lunch. Thanks. Totally. Thank you. You do anything today? Mm-mm. Did you read the paper? Mm-mm. You don't need to do that. I like to. You hungry? I have to say this. I think you need to talk to someone, professionally. I'm good. You're not. After three years you should be in a better place. Ready? I'm donating my brain to science. What do I get out of it? Digital immortality. That sounds awful. How about you'll be helping me out? That, I'm down with. Comfortable? I'm not sure if comfortable is appropriate. Tolerable? Tolerable. Consciousness is in the prefrontal cortex, and if such as thing as this so exists. All right. It would be there along with the other higher functions. Emotions. Remember these? So, I just stroll down memory lane? Yes. I knew you would break my heart from the moment our eyes crossed, and when our lips first met. From the first time you hugged me tightly and inhaled my musk. I knew he would break my heart from the moment our eyes crossed, and when our lips first met. From the first time you hugged me tightly, and inhaled my musk. Hello? Ms. Lena Thierry? This is she. Good evening ma'am. We have you down as Didier Lole's emergency contact is that correct? Mm-hm. I'm sorry there's been an accident. Mr. Loles was mortally wounded. We need you to come, and identify his remains in the medical examiner's office. I'm really sorry. Ma'am, ma'am, hello? A cruel fate love is. It fills you up. Concurrently it hollows you out, shattering you before putting you back together again. Hopefully as Hemingway believed, I'll be stronger in the broken place. On. Execute program. Didier? Are you there? It's me, Lena. Am I dead? You look beautiful.
