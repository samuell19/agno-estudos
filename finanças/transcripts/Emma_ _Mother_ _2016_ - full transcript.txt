SOUTH SULAWESI CIRCA 1950 Hey! Come here! Where are you heading to? What do you have in there? Take this. Come here! Traveling from Bone was worth it, right? This is a lucky place, sir. -This one has the best quality. -Take this one. Thank you, Andi. How is it? Take this one. Pillow cover and thin blanket from Java can be sold in Bulukumba. Shall we go now, sir? Hey, just tell me. If there is anything that can be sold, bring it here, we'll arrange it. Rusdi, if there are no obstacles or mob interference, bring your children and my cousin, Aisyah to Makassar. Yes, ma'am. -Peace be upon you. -And unto you. Good morning, listeners in the Archipelago and Makassar. Do you remember this? Yes. I brought that when we were married. My mom made that. Yes, it's still good. My wife is also still beautiful. When did the last time you've got your period? -Auntie Aisyah? -Come here. We need to prepare some energy to make new diapers. Your younger sibling will be here soon. Hi. Thank you. Smile, everyone. SOUTH SULAWESI'S PUBLIC FIGURES ...goes forward. He kicks the ball and goal! Goal! Asr prayer. Is this one done yet? Is the one that's facing forward done? Cu? Cu. Let's pray Subuh, son. It doesn't matter whether you have kids or not. -It's for togetherness, sir. -Yes. -God willing, we all will back you up. -That's right. If it has been tested, -we can meet with the family. -Right. This is a good sign. -Please. -Please. The most important thing is this organization must run. Please eat a lot. So you can be like your dad. Our business is still new. What are you looking for? My hair tonic. Oh, right. It has run out. Someone is hiding a party from me. Hey, there's a relative coming from Java who wants to supply some rice. I'm going. Please have dinner at home. Yes, if God wills. Where is your mom? Aisyah. Is your spicy fish soup still hot? Please. Eat. Ira, get me that plate. How many nights will you stay in Parepare? Three nights, at most. Anno, prepare the car! I'm leaving, Cu! Peace be unto you. And unto you peace. So, how was the match last night? It was exciting. PSM won't win. They were like soldiers with empty guns. Just shot randomly. Cu. What news did you get from the office? Kick it! Over here, Cu! Here, Cu! Cu! Cu, play it right. Just like how your dad plays with women. Cu! Stop it. Sir? Where's Ucu? Maybe he still out, playing soccer. Get your sister inside. I called you... because I would like to ask something. Is it true what people are saying? When is the party? Rusdi. Tonight, ma'am. In Jakarta. Your mom was born during a difficult time. That was a long dry season at Bukaka. I lived on the village border. On the side of the river. I was kept away. It was because your great granddad's wife was there. Your mom was born. Then it began to rain. Bukaka smelled fragrant. I gave your mom a beautiful name. Athirah. Women's fragrance. I am still here. I'm the one who called the kids to eat. I'm the one who called them to pray. We've had dinner together. But not much changed. I'll accompany you for a while. Peace be upon you. And unto you. -We're leaving, Mom. -Peace be unto you. And unto you peace. Take care, kids. -Are you the one handling this? -Yes, sir. Let's have lunch. Eat lots of rice. Fish? Cu. It's time for Subuh prayer, son. Peace and the mercy of Allah be on you. Peace and the mercy of Allah be on you. Allah is the Greatest. Hey, so pretty. Hi. Come on. Let's get this done. Cu. It turns out that letter is not only for exchanging romantic or longing words. Do we know the family of your dad's wife? How could she say that I disturbed their family? Read it Cu. Sir. Landak Street. Peace be unto you, Cu. -And unto you peace. -Aisyah. Have you bathed Salman? Yes, ma'am. All right. Take care of Imi first. Seven cloves. Dear, listeners throughout the Archipelago and those in Makassar, this is the Radio of Republic Indonesia in Makassar. Oh, my love Oh, you're so flirty Aisyah. Let's go. Let's go out. Move over, Cu. How's your school going? -Is it fine? -Yes, it is. Yes. Vegetables, please. Aisyah, go get some rest. I'll take care of it later. Mom. Dad asked for more fish. Nuraini! Ira! Cu! Please eat! It's good. Mom, the food is really good. Drink this. Goodness. Your cloth is so worn out. There's something I haven't told you. Do you know? At the time when the Dutch come and go, everything was difficult. Even a thread was hard to find. But we still weave, especially the ones from Wajo. We did not give up. We didn't want to lose just like that. Whatever we can use... Even banana fiber was turned into cloth. There was a caterpillar crisis in Wajo. People went the distance to look for cocoons to make some silk. Some died on the way. Your dad wanted to marry me. He went looking for threads. To Enrekang, three days trip. So that your grandma could make this sarong to propose me, his fourth wife. This folding cloth is like an heirloom. Always keep whatever you think important for your life. And this... It will probably be useful someday. Mom. I want to try to weave sarong, Mom. How long will it take to weave? Ucu, do you still have the energy to take me home? Ucu only wants to take the sweetest one home. -Where do you want to go? -Cu, look at this. The most famous Bone's Merchant, Ucu's dad. Your husband can also wear this. This one is Mandar. It's beautiful. Can you give me a discount? Is that the price? If we don't sell it now, the price will go even lower. Are there any fresh vegetables? Which one? Three of this, please. The money should be enough, right? Here. You're getting smarter. -Thank you, sir. -Sure. Ida, we've been in the same school since long time ago. But she remains in SMA 1 when we moved here. It's been a year since she's joining us in here. There she is. Ida! The color is beautiful. Ma'am, could you stand? How is it? I really love the color of the sarong. It has a good motif. Can I order three pieces? This is not for sale. It's a dowry from my husband. Hello, ma'am. Please come in. Give me a moment, please. -I want to see this one. -Sure. Here it is. Here, one more. It's a new model. Please. Which one, Aisyah? This one. -This one? -Yes. What's with your neck, Cu? You look like a giraffe. You're going home on foot today. Hey. I've got a Vespa. I see. I mean... If you want, I can take you home. I brought my bicycle. Don't you see? Uncle! Ira, have you bathed your little brother? -Not yet. -Prepare the water. I'll bathe him later. Peace be unto you. -Mom. -And unto you peace. Eat first. Okay. We've asked. Just relax. There is a lot of new information. Ida is from the Minang tribe. She was born in Sibolga. And her dad is a teacher. She's the eldest daughter from her seven siblings. -All of them are boys, Cu. -Hey, you're scaring him. She has many bodyguards, Ucu. But don't give up quickly. Good luck. Ida! Ida! I just want to be your friend, Ida. Sorry. I don't want you to follow me home. WARRIOR I know something cooler than your gloom. Bantimurung. Look, Cu. Ida's class will go to Bantimurung next week. Other classes can join too. As long as we're cooperative. The money has been collected. And you will be joining us too. I've registered you. And everything has been paid. -Really, Karim? -You'll thank us later, Ucu. Bantimurung. I'm sorry. I must've troubled your heart. I'm hard to get close to. But we really are... This is hard for me. My dad... knows who your family is. He knows who your dad is. Who doesn't know him? He is very worried if we got close, you will be the same. I'm sorry. Mom is trying to liven up this house. How? By getting pregnant again? Cu. Pray, son. Are you angry with me? Aisyah, don't make it too thick. Ucu! Ucu! Mom! Ucu! Go find help! Please help, Ucu! Help, Ucu! Ucu! Ms. Athirah's family? Cu. Are you still mad at me? Forgive me, Mom. Please forgive me, Mom. Have you read Mr. Mattulada's invitation? I also wanted to talk about that. But I've got too many things to deal with. Mr. Mattulada has helped us since a long time ago. He wants to marry off his child. Just because you've got things or two to do? God. Besides, we have never be seen together for a long time. Peace be upon you. And unto you. I'll accompany you, Mom. I'll go on behalf of Dad. Don't forget to brush your teeth, Cu. Mom, come on. The car is ready. Mom. You look so beautiful. Let's go. -Emi, we're leaving. -Yes, Mom. Congratulations. Sorry, my husband couldn't come. Oh, don't worry about it. -Athirah. -Hello. Why don't you come with your husband? He's out of town. He's so busy. Please. Ma'am, what grade is Ucu in now? -Third grade of Junior High School. -He's big already. I'm sure he will take over your husband's business soon. Yes. Mom, let's go home. Come on, Mom. Let's move. -How are you doing? -Fine. Can you remake this sarong? Yes. -Can we all remake this sarong? -We can. Please come in. This is yours. The color is so beautiful. -This one. -That's good, ma'am. Rusdi, have we paid for it? -This, sir? -Do you still remember? Rusdi. -Come here. -Yes, sir. Postpone the delivery -next week. -Yes, sir. -Isn't it nice, Aisyah? -It's really nice. -Send my greetings for them. -Yes, thank you. I want to make a school in Makassar. Do it, we've got so much money. It's not about money. It needs time and effort. It needs to be cared for. Aisyah. I bought this. Mr. Hatta's skull cap. Bone's King's descendant. He needs money. Who knows my child will be someone prominent. It needs to be cleaned often. Ucu! Come here, son. Go. Please try this. You look dashing. You will be someone important someday. A governor. Look. Handsome, right? Radio of Republic Indonesia in Makassar broadcasting the national news. Indonesia's economy today is at its lowest point. This happened prior to the weak production level and the devaluation policy of Rupiah in the amount of 72 percent at the end... The United States mourns. The President, John F. Kennedy has been fatally shot by someone from the top of a building in his political visits to the state of Texas in Dallas city on November 22, 1963. While riding in a presidential motorcade, President Kennedy was accompanied by his wife, Jacqueline Kennedy... I heard about some hustle in the newspaper. What was it about, Rusdi? Politic, ma'am. I don't get it. Near the port, there were so many people closing their businesses. Jakarta is tensed up right now. So, how's my husband's business? It's a bit down. The problem is the currency. All I know is that -your husband is often angry now. -What? Rusdi, that's okay, I'll take care of it. You go home now. So your value won't come down in your wife's eyes. Yes, ma'am. -Peace be unto you. -And unto you peace. -Please be patient, sir. -How is this, sir? -Where is he? -How could this happen? -Be patient, sir. -How could such a thing happen? -Please, sir. Be patient. -Now what? What do we do now? We have to shop for food. Wait. We'll get this handled, sir. -How long has it been? -The goods have run out. PEDOMAN RAKYAT HYPERINFLATION I'm finished. I don't have anything. But I still need to pay. That money that I kept... There's no value in it. Not to mention that I just sent a lot of money to Samarinda last week. There are lots of purchases. Oh, God. I'm finished. So, did the construction at Barru stop? There's no way I can continue. I need to pay the employee's salary. What will happen to their families if I don't? It's also my responsibility, right? I'm leaving, sir. We'll talk again later. There are so many problems here, Cu. Businesses piled up. This is normal in business, Cu. There will be a way out. Hey. Are your siblings doing fine? Auntie Aisyah was asked to go to Bantaeng to get coconuts. Why did she bring home three sacks that day? Apparently, the difference between Bantaeng and Kalang is obvious. We're at fault too. Why didn't we tell her immediately? Even if I told her immediately, she wouldn't listen to me. How am I at fault? -Peace be upon you. -And unto you. And unto you. And unto you. Please move, Ira. There's a guest. Bantaeng, coconut, brown sugar, and tuna. It's you Cu. Come on. That's so random. -Let's eat, Dad. -Yes. You're always wrong. No way. Cu. Cu. Take the box in my room. Take it out. Here. Subtitle translation by Dandi Amirullah
