He was wearing like this really stupid orange camouflage shirt. That's good, Becky. And do you remember what happened to the man in the orange camouflage shirt? What happened by your fort, Becky? Help. I'm sorry. I don't know. Boys, stop that before someone gets hurt. Come on, get to class. Let's go, let's go. Let's go. Move. Please send Becky Hooper to the front office. Her father's here to pick her up. On your feet. Hi, Chipmunk. Good back there? Yup. Excuse me. What's going on? There's something wrong with this gentleman. Shit. What? Pull over. Wanna guess why I sprung you early? What? Can you take your? Can you turn your music off please? Got about a quarter tank. I'm gonna pull over. Oh hey, they have meat sticks. I wonder if they have bison. Gummies. You hate gummy worms. Search continues for four inmates who escaped federal custody this morning, killing two armed guards and an inmate as they fled. Authorities say the men are armed and extremely dangerous. In other news. Looks like the Atlanta Braves are off to a great start this season. I'm gonna turn it over to Matt. A small one. What flavor? Can you picture? Those are the shoes I have. Still looks good? Yes. - Okay. - Of course, of course. Yes, okay. Here we go. Ready? Mm hm. Oh. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Mom is in serious painter mode. What do you think? Why is Dora's head way bigger than Dad's? She's just so full of herself, right. She is pretty awesome. Okay, got a surprise for you. Gotta close your eyes. There. Okay, open 'em. Oh, Becky. Much love, girlie. This whole thing. I know it's been hard, but you can't stay angry forever. Why would you bring me here? Calm down, Chipmunk. Don't call me that. I thought you said it would take time. Like with the realtors or whatever. Yeah, so about that now. Can you turn that off, please? Now. Off. Becky. Rebecca Hooper, if the next button you press is not the off button, you're grounded for two weeks. You can't keep taking things that aren't yours. Obviously I can. She wouldn't want us to sell it. Becky... No, just because she's not here anymore... We're not selling it. Been trying to tell you. I changed my mind. We're keeping it. Oh, you forgot you hated me for a minute, huh? Diego, we're keeping it. We're keeping it. Come on. Come on, boy, let's go swimming. No. No, I wanna swim. Yeah, but how 'bout after dinner? There's something else I need to talk to you about. What is she doing here? Well that's part of it. I invited Kayla and Ty up for the weekend. You made it. Thank you GPS. I'll park it next to mine. Do I have to tip the valet? Yes. Yes, you do. Oh, I missed you. Same here. Hey, Becky. It's so generous of you to share your dad and this place with us this weekend. The drive here was gorgeous. You didn't tell her that we were coming, did you? I tried. Hey, little man. - How you doing? - Hi. I know someone who's excited to meet you. Come here. Oh. Oh, hi. Oh, hi. Oh, she's really nice. - She's sweet. - It's okay. All right, girl, give the man some room. What's her name? Dora. Diego's down by the lake, but he takes a bit longer getting used to new people, but he knows a lot of tricks. Pretty much anything Becky asks. Maybe she'll show you if you ask. Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah, oh see look. See, she likes you. She likes everyone. Why don't you go get Diego? 'Cause we're about to eat. Fine. Will you take Ty with you? What? No. You let her walk all over you. She's 13. Don't worry about Becky. She's like Diego, takes a bit longer getting used to new people. Do you wanna help me build the fire pit? We can have s'mores after dinner. What's s'mores? What's s'mores? I know. Oh, you are in for a treat. Come on. Good afternoon. What's going on? Could you step out of the vehicle? We appreciate your compliance. You live nearby? Half a mile that way. Driver's license please. My partner's gonna inspect your vehicle. Gunshot will carry half a mile. Don't wanna alarm your wife. What? Ty. Stop feeding the dog your food. But she's hungry. No. Becky, we've got something that we would like to talk to you about. Can you look at me, Chipmunk? I told you not to call me that. Yes Rebecca, I would like to tell you something and I would like you to look at me. Okay so. I know things have been tough this past year. On all of us, but especially on you. Still, we have to look forward. Part of the healing process is moving on. Now, Kayla and I, we love each other very much. So we've decided to get married. What? I know it's a big deal and it's gonna take some getting used to, but it's what we want and... Is this a joke? It's. I think a more stable environment will be a good thing for you. She would've hated you. Becky. Sorry. That's okay. We both knew that this wasn't going to be easy. I'm gonna go check on her. No, I got it. How could you? I loved your mom so much. Yeah. Yeah, I can really tell. Becky. Diego. Will you please come back and talk, please? Becky. Ty, stop that. That's for you to eat. Where did they go? They're outside talking. They'll be right back. It's okay. Eat your dinner. Diego, we're staying. We're staying. Come on. Come on. Hello, may I help you? Just play a little bit of my favorite song. Okay. ♪ I will stay by your side ♪ ♪ I will stay by your side ♪ ♪ And I want you to find me ♪ ♪ So I'll stay by your side ♪ ♪ I will stay by your side ♪ ♪ I will ♪ It's okay. Where's your mom, Ty? Kayla? Jeff, this gentleman lost his dog. Yeah, I'm afraid he's a bit of a Houdini. I'm sorry to interrupt your dinner. It's nice to meet you, Jeff. Hi. Can I get you some water? Oh, that'd be great. Thank you. Here you go. What kind of dog did you say? I didn't. Well it might help to know what we're looking for. Okay, well if there's nothing else... Cane Corso. Your dog's a Corso? No, your dog's a Corso. Yes. Doesn't look pure, though. Well, we're not sure. She's a rescue. Why don't you give us your number? My dog is a rottweiler. Pure bred. Or as the Germans call them. Butcher's dog. Endurance. Intelligence. Strength. Traits they were bred for. It's in their blood. That's why you never let them mate with other breeds. You get the worst of both. Okay, I think it's time for you to go. I'm gonna go check on Ty. You're leaving right now. Clear out front. Dining room. She's probably going for a phone. Stay calm. Why don't you take a seat on the couch? No. Don't. Please, don't. Please. Please. Take him and walk out the side door now. Go. You see anything? Nothing yet. Yeah, there's snakes. There's snakes. There's spiders. There's fucking bats. There's everything. Fuck. The mosquitoes are killing me. I don't know. Come on, Ty. Keep up. But we gotta wait for Dora. What? She'll be fine. We are going to go find Miss Becky. I need you to move faster. Hey, there. Where you headed? Nowhere. We're going to get Becky. Becky? Who's Becky? Our dog. You got a dog? I hate dogs. Ooh, there she is right there. Big one. Shit. No, don't, don't. What was that? Gunshots. Sh. Quiet, boy. Quiet, quiet. Fuck that. Think you got it, Sharp Shooter? Where are they? I took care of the phone. That wasn't my question. It's okay. It's okay. Okay, yeah, yeah. Okay. Stay. Stay. I think we may have a problem here. You? Couch. Sit. I'll make sure the rest of the house is clear. Pistol Pete up there shot Becky. That dog wasn't gonna hurt you. Becky was a sweet old thing. We're clear. Excellent. Well, I'm gonna get what we came for and then we'll be on our way. Just do what they say and we'll be okay. Jeff, we've seen their faces. I don't think they're gonna let us live. We have to do something. Shit. There once was a little girl who had a little curl right in the middle of her forehead. There once was a little girl who had a little curl right in the middle of her forehead. What kind of backpack would you say that is? A sparkly one. Does it look like a dog's backpack? Dogs don't wear backpacks. You're right. Becky's not a dog. Becky is a little girl. I'm looking for a key. It's about this big. It has this symbol engraved on it. Have you seen it? No. No. How 'bout you? Have you seen it? He's never been here before. Well that leaves little Becky. I need to speak to her. She's not here. She's in Atlanta with her mom. Oh. Yet her backpack and her phone are here. See Jeff, I wanna believe you. I really do, but you're not making it easy. Lucky for us, I brought a lie detector. So I'm gonna ask again. Where's Becky? Atlanta. Wait, wait, wait. Ah. Look at that. Clean through. Missed the bone. She's gonna be fine. Now the little boy. No, no, please not my son. Please don't. It may just blow his leg clean off. - Please don't. - Answer his question. Please don't. Please, please, please. Hey, assholes. Oh my God. I called the cops. They're on their way. Hello, Becky. Better start running. That fat one. He's gonna like need a head start or something. You didn't call anyone, sweetheart. I have your cell phone. So? So I walked to our neighbors. The Griffins. I used their phone. They have a gun, too. So you better leave. Closest neighbor is a mile and a half. This is a child's toy. No way it reaches that far. Gentlemen, Becky is on this property. And I don't think any of us feels like playing a game of hide and seek, so why don't we make it easy on ourselves and invite her to us, okay? Stop her bleeding. We might need her. Why don't you walk Jeffery outside? No, no, don't take him, please. Please don't take him. Please don't do this to us. Please don't. Prepare yourself, Becky. You're about to find out what happens when you lie to me. You know. I wasn't blessed with children in the traditional sense, but I collected some strays along the way. My eldest. You know my most beautiful memory of him was? Wasn't the day I found him. It was the day he proved his love for me. And tonight, right now actually, will become your most beautiful memory of Becky 'cause this is the moment she proves her love for you. Becky, I'm gonna speak to you like an adult, because I expect you to act like one. You're not at the neighbors. I know you're in the woods behind the house. So do me a favor and direct your gaze to the fire pit. My companion here, the unreasonably large, scary one. He's gonna hold your dad still while I hurt him. I can promise you it will not be pleasant. Now we can avoid that unpleasantness if you cooperate. Listen closely. In the basement, in the wall, was a small tin. Do you know what I'm talking about? No. See, I don't believe you. You already lied to me once. Now I think you found that tin and you took what was inside it. I don't have your stupid key. I never said it was a key, Becky. Now that I know you have it, I hope you enjoy the show. Ah. Ah, ah. Ah. It's okay. It's okay, baby. You get one shot. Make it count. Becky. Listen to me, Chipmunk. Sorry. I made a mistake. So many mistakes. Look. I know that you're mad at me and you have every right to be. I need you to put those feelings aside and do something for me. I need you to run away as fast as you can. Run, Becky. Before you run, Becky, listen up and know that you can stop this if you want. Ah. Ah. No, stop. Stop. I'll get your key. I'll get your key. Ah. Stop. Stop. Ah. I've got your key. I'm coming. I'm coming, please. I'm almost there. Hold him. Stop. Oh, there she is. Let's go get her. No. We don't have time for this. No more kids. Go to the neighbors. Call the police. But Dad. Right behind you. I love you, Becky. Go now. Where's the key, Becky? Where is it? Right here. Ah. Fuck. Fuck. Ugh. Ah. Fuck. Holy shit. What happened to you? Oh, that little bitch is in the woods out there. I can't see out of it. Ugh. It's gone. It's shredded. Fuck. Where's Hammond? The kitchen. They go nowhere. Yeah. You enjoying your snack? Oh shit. Cut it off, man. Cut it off. Come on. Easy. Okay, here we go. - You ready? - Yeah, just do it. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. What the fuck is the problem? You fucking kidding me. Sorry. Ah. Now get the fuck outside and grab her before I decide you're too useless to keep around. Becky, where are you at? Let's just make this easy on both of us, okay? Hey. Hey Becky. Stop running. Oh, man, you're in a fort now. What am I gonna do? I guess you should've locked the door. Fuck, fuck. Shit. Ugly son of a bitch. Fuck me. Two fucking dogs. How many fucking dogs you gotta have? Diego, quiet. Motherfucker. Sit. Fuck. Hey. Cool fort. Hi. I just wanna talk. No, hey. We're just talking. We're just talking. I don't have a weapon. I'm not gonna hurt you. Hello? Go away. Look, kid. You really think I wanna be out here, tripping over shit in the woods? You want me to go. I want to go. But neither of us is gonna get what we want until I get that key. So let's you and I make a little deal. Just throw the key out here. I'll tell 'em that I picked it up off the ground. I'll say you got away. They're not gonna ask too many questions so long as I have the key. Okay? Okay. Okay. You can just toss it on out here and I'll be on my way. You, your little bro and your mom will be safe. What? I said you and your mom and your little brother. You'll all be safe. My mom's dead. Okay well, your stepmom then. Whatever. The point is, she's still alive and the little boy is still alive. And you can go off and have a nice life together. Right? Becky? We still got a deal or what? Hello? I'm getting your stupid key. Give me a second. Here it comes. Good throw. Fucking kids. Ah. Ah. Ah. Fuck. Ah. What the fuck? Fuck. I think my leg is still bleeding pretty bad. It's okay. It's fine. I'll wrap it tighter. I heard Jeff screaming. Is he? You tried to help us before. You and I both know how this is gonna end for me. For my son. You don't want that. You don't want this. You don't. Please. Apex. Please. I'm not gonna let them get away with this. Take it. Take the gun, Apex. Here you go. Now, point it at my heart. Nine years, four months, and two days. You know what that is? How long we were in. That's right. That's 54,538 waking hours. Do you know how many of those I spent planning, calculating, this day? Hm? Do you have any idea how many? Every. Single. One. Not a moment went by that this plan, and our glorious execution of it, wasn't at the forefront of my mind. Now, when you plan something, anything, you run all the scenarios in your head. You identify vulnerabilities, weak points. You try to find out what that thing is going to be. The one thing that's gonna be your downfall. All the times I ran it, never once did I think it would be you. Those kids. I can't get them out of my mind. Put your finger on the trigger. I don't understand. Put. Your finger. On the trigger. I can't do this without you, son. I need you on this. 54,538 hours planning. I don't wanna be alive for one more knowing that we came this far and we failed. So, if you're not gonna help me, you go ahead and kill me. I knew I could count on you, son. For the Brotherhood. For the Brotherhood. Cole. There once was a little girl who had a little curl right in the middle of her forehead. When she was good, she was very, very good, but when she was bad, she was horrid. I need you to tell Becky to come back. You feel better now? I'm not gonna ask again. Speak slow and clear. She won't listen to me. You're her guardian. No, I'm not. And it wouldn't matter even if I was. Becky is as strong-willed and vindictive as they come and you just tortured and killed her only living parent. So good luck. Go get her. Hammond's still out there. Yes, but apparently Becky's a little more than we bargained for. Cole. Cole. You okay? Fuck. Shit. Hey, shit stain. You want the key? You gotta catch me first. Come back here. Right over here. Not gonna hurt ya. I'm gonna fucking kill you. Little fucking bitch. Slow down. End of the line, little fucker. Fuck. Fuck. Ah. Hey. Fuck. Help. I can't swim. Help please. Help me. Help me. Help me. Help me. Help. Help. Stop, stop, stop. Ah. No. Diego, no. No. Diego. Please, Diego, Diego. Please. Please. You should have left when you had the chance. No. Let me go. Let me go, let me go. Stop. Ah. I saw what you did to Cole. Those kind of things, they leave a stain. I got too many stains of my own. It's not too late for you. You're just a kid. I'm done. I don't care what Dominick wants anymore. I am walking away and I hope you will, too. Diego. Diego. Diego, Diego. It's okay. You're okay. You're okay, boy. It's okay. Hold. Hold. Hey, dad. It's me, Chipmunk. Tell mom hi for me. Diego, come. Hey. What the fuck was the point of all of this? What's that? I said, what the fuck was the point? You cursed. I know, baby. Sometimes someone does something so stupid, you have to stop them and ask, what the fuck was the point? You murdered my fiance. Your men are gone. You lost your fucking eye. For what? For a key? What the fuck could it open that would make it worth all of this? Oh. It's worth much more than that. See I don't expect you to understand this, but I'm doing it for your kind as much as mine. Oh, is that right? Yeah, it is right. You see the races all were created with a divine purpose, but our modern world has blurred and distorted that purpose. But that's all about to change. I have a question. Did it take years of hard work to get this fucking stupid? Okay. See you seem to be under the delusion... That you're a fucking bitch. Yeah. Fucking. Don't, don't. Let me tell you something. When I come back, your son's gonna watch you die. Get off. Apex? Okay, you stay here. Don't move. Don't move. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. I know you're in there, Becky. Are you having fun? I know I am. Let's just see how fun we can make it, huh. Come on. Let's have some fun. Open the door, Becky. Come on, Becky, do it. Come on. Give me your hands. Give me your hands. Roadside vehicle assist. This is Kate. A collision was detected and it appears your airbags have deployed. Are there any injuries? Hello? Are you able to respond? I'll notify the local authorities. Help is on the way. Becky. Becky. You're clearly a special girl. So, I'm gonna make you a special deal. I'm putting my gun away. Okay. Your dog is still alive. He's safe. You're safe. I just wanna talk. ♪ Find me ♪ ♪ I will stay by your side ♪ ♪ And I want you to find me ♪ ♪ So I'll stay by your side ♪ ♪ I can always be found ♪ ♪ I can always be found ♪ ♪ I can always be found ♪ ♪ I can always be found ♪ ♪ I will stand by your side ♪ ♪ And I want you to find me ♪ ♪ So I'll stay by your side ♪ I think you staying by my side is a good idea, Becky. You're an orphan now. Has that sunk in yet? You're a smart-ass. Stubborn. A murderer. That's what they'll say. People looking to adopt. Why would we choose her? Who wants that burden? No one. You'll just end up in the system. One terrible foster home after the next. That's if you're lucky. No one will bother to look close enough to see the real you. No one but me. See I. I see your potential. The raw clay waiting to take shape. We had a rocky start, but that's all behind us. With the right guidance, one day you'll be able to look back on this and see that it was a great moment in your life. A real turning point. If you just let me help. You can help by shutting your face. Where is the key? I hid it. Show me. I wanna show you something else first. We don't have time for this. I don't wanna have to hurt you. But I do wanna hurt you. Real bad. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. Fucking little bitch. Stop. No. There was a little girl who had a little bullet right in the middle of her. Son, take it easy. Take it easy. Okay? Look, it's me. Let her go. After what she did to me? To us? I don't want you to kill her. It's almost over now. Look, I've got the key already. It's right here. Everything we've ever worked for. After her, no more kids. Ever, I promise. But right now we need to finish this. For the Brotherhood. I said, let her go. Bet you're right. Who's gonna believe a little girl anyway, right? Go, Becky. Now. Ah. Ah. I'm sorry. I should never have left you alone to face him. There's no undoing the things I've done, but maybe by saving you. Becky. Are you okay? Is there anything else you can tell us? Any detail. Doesn't matter how small. Something. Something about a Canadian quarter. He was looking for it. In the grass. Is that what you want? Don't worry about satisfying the Sheriff. Just answer the questions as best you can. She remembers the shirt, but not stabbing him in the face with her art pencils? Blind spots. I'm not surprised. The violence she's witnessed. It's the violence she committed that worries me.
