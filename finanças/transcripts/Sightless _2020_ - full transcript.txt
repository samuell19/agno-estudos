[instrumental music] [thunder rumbling] [siren wailing] [birds chirping] [latch clicks] [intense music] [horn blaring] [horn blaring] [music intensifies] [horn blaring] [beeping] [man on PA] Blue team in the ICU, please. Blue team, ICU. [beeping] [gasps] [screams] [beeping] [liquid dripping] [door opens] [breathing heavily] [Omar] Ms. Ashland? I'm Omar. I'm the nurse who's been taking care of you. You're at Columbia Western Hospital. - You're safe here. - [breathing heavily] Are you comfortable? How about we take these bandages off, huh? [Omar] Ah... [groans] [gasps] Why can't I see? I'll let your doctor know you're ready. - Back in two blinks. - [knocks] [Katsuro] I understand we're trying to reach your brother overseas. Japan, is it? - [Katsuro] Look at me, please. - Is that really necessary? Not sure. Doctors on TV do it. What is happening? Who did this to me? [gasps] Ah! Now the chemicals that you were exposed to left your optic nerve intact, but seared. In simple terms, and I'm so sorry to say this, uh, but the damage is irreversible. [sobbing] [screaming] [screaming] [breathing heavily] How tall would you say he or she was? - He. - Could be either. It felt like a man. [indistinct announcement on PA] [sighs] This medication. Is there anything else of value in your car? - My Ruggieri. - What's that? Other than tough to spell. Violin. I just took it out of storage. - You'd say it's worth... - Five-hundred thousand. Dollars? No, we didn't see that. And still no trace of your phone? - Treating this as a robbery... - [Ellen] It wasn't. I told you, he came for me to do this to me. Did some reading on your husband. Ex-husband. No shortage of people he upset. Or there's your celebrity. Before him. Any interesting fans, ever? Haven't been famous in a long time. But that famous? It ever go away? [sighs] Can we... We'll speak again soon. We'll find this guy. And in the meantime, let yourself adjust to your new world. Let your senses get caught up. [door opens] [door shuts] We got your brother. Here. Hello. - Hello? - [Easton] Hello? - [Easton] Ellen, you there? - Easton? Ellen, Christ. I can't believe that... This is what it takes for us to talk? [Easton] I guess so. I've hired your care for two months until I'm back. He's on the line with us. Mr. Haley, are you there? [Clayton on phone] Clayton, please. Ms. Ashland, hello. [Easton] I was just about to tell my sister how you come highly recommended. And your specialty... people transitioning into a new... [Ellen] Handicap? [Clayton] Lifestyle. [Easton] Think I found you an apartment near downtown. Can tell you all about it, but just know that it's safe, quiet. What you need. [car alarm blaring] [horn blaring] [car door shuts] [car lock beeps] [siren wailing] [knocking on door] Yes? [Clayton] We spoke yesterday. I'm Clayton. I hope I didn't startle you, I let myself in. - Where am I? - [Clayton] Home. For now. It's apartment 902. I can come back later, it's no problem. Wait. Come in. [door opens] It's nice to meet you, Ms. Ashland. Sun's out today. Bet you're happy to be out of the hospital. This place kinda reminds me of that story... The Veldt? - I think it's by Bradbury. - What? Uh, this family, in their luxurious home, a-anything the kids imagined, the house brings to life. How'd I get here? We took a town car to the city, right? Yeah, well, these would kick a linebacker's ass. My brother described photos. Living room, kitchen. But in here? Bathroom straight ahead, hallway on the right, window on your left. Colors of this room are shades of blue, meant to soothe. And you? Ooh. Who do I want to be today? If I said a young Brando, would that make it easier? Maybe for you. Look, I know you hate this, and you can hate me, too, but I'm the easiest part of this puzzle. I graduated top of my nursing class. I've worked with plenty of patients like you before, legally-blind, deaf, young, old. I'm the Ferrari of personal care. Uh, how does lunch in 30 sound? - Not hungry. - Mm, you gotta eat. I'll take it in here. This place is nice, but it isn't the Ritz. Kitchen in 30. [siren wailing] [cutlery clanking] [cutlery clanking] [water sloshing] There she is. Don't do that. Sorry, it's just that you snuck up on me. On you? Why don't you have some of this garlic penne, and then we'll get a lay of the land? [Clayton] I'm here weekdays 11:00 to 2:00, for now. Rejoice or shudder at that thought. I'll let myself in, I'll tend to cooking, some cleaning, but I'm mostly here to help in the capital A adjustment department. Losing your sight doesn't mean you have to lose yourself. You can do all the things you love, that you're good at, and more. And down the line, I'll teach you Braille, your cane, dictation software. Eleven calls building security. Twenty two gets my cell. Programmed here and the master bedroom. I am off to the finicky Mr. Hudson on Mercer Island, unless you need anything else. It's been my pleasure, Ms. Ashland. Hasta manana. [door shuts] [door locks] [elevator bell dings] [line ringing] [Sasha on voicemail] Hi, you've reached Sasha. I'll get back to you. Third time trying. I can't reach my brother, his work, time zones. I get it. But you? Where are you? I hate it here. It feels so... empty. It isn't home. I miss you. - [dramatic music] - [gasps] - [spraying] - [gasps] [screaming] [gasps] - [spraying] - [screaming] - [thunder rumbling] - [breathing heavily] [sighs] - [gasps] - [intense music] [sighs] [Clayton] I got you something. [chirping] - I can take her back. - No, no. What color? [Clayton] What do you want it to be? - It doesn't matter what I want. - Sure it does. And you see her in your head, so your imagination's either free in there or... [Ellen] Opposite of free is captive. Which you would know something about? Mm-mm. Other than you as my cell mate? I've had to use my imagination. Might as well redecorate the whole place in my head while we're at it. What color is she? [Clayton] Baby blue. [instrumental music] [Clayton] You gonna name her? [Ellen] We just did. Put a mirror in there, will you? Let her recognize something. [Clayton] Sure. Come here. How come I can hear all this... [wind whooshing] still loud and clear? - If it's overkill, y... - Shh! But here... This is thicker glass. Faces west, and wind coming off the bay. You got a voicemail. [Bryce on voicemail] Ms. Ashland, it's Detective Bryce. I've looked into the clients of your husband, and everyone checks out so far. Forensics couldn't pull any unusual fingerprints from your car, but there are boot treads we're looking into. Think of anything, call me. [telephone beeps] Your brother told me how it happened. Hey, it's okay, you're safe. No one's gonna find you here. Castle keep. Heard that before. - Bennett. - The ex? His words, "You hang with me, you're safe with me." - You googled us? - None of my business. Ah. Maybe. Yeah, it's kinda the first thing I did. Tend to find yourself on scorched earth when you steal other people's life savings. Except Sasha. She's the only friend who stuck around... even after what we did to her. We? The kind of money he made for everyone... - Nobody questioned it. - Who'd want to? - And now he's... - Serving 15. Pissed off someone who can't get to him, so they're after me, instead. And if I couldn't see them the first time... Okay. Enough. Sit. Look, I know it's hard, but no amount of anger is going to save you. Optimism, passion, who you were before him... Ended. Music? The violin. Your album went gold. I saw the videos, child prodigy sells out London, Prague, moves people to tears. [Clayton] Who you were, the original Ellen... Ended with it. Can we not? All I'm saying is, you might not know... Can we not? [sighs] Definitely not the Ritz. Salt. I'm sorry. I'm no good like this. [salt sprinkling] [Clayton] I am going to leave you with this. Because I value my personal safety, I wouldn't dare force a lesson on you just yet. Au revoir? [door shuts] [static on TV] [clicking] [instrumental music on radio] [volume increases] [water splattering] [sighs] [exhales] [door opens] [sighs] [footsteps approaching] [intense music] [door opens] [dial pad beeping] [line ringing] [man on voicemail] You've reached the security office for The Lacuna Center... [call disconnects] [doorknob rattling] [dial pad beeping] [line ringing] [Sasha on voicemail] Hi, you've reached Sasha. I'll get back to you... [sighs] [intense music] [clicking] [whirring] [sighs] [water dripping] [sighs] [intense music] [line ringing] [Clayton] Ellen... [sighs] [telephone ringing] - [sighs] - [Clayton] You okay? Didn't mean to. Night. [sighs] - [clanking] - [gasps] [woman sobbing] [intense music] Hello? [woman sobbing] [man] I'm not gonna tell you again! [indistinct chatter] [man grunting] [indistinct chatter] [dramatic music] [woman] What she needs someone! Do you know what you've done? [man] I told you to stay away from her, okay? She's drugged, she's dangerous. She's a drunk. [woman] She needs help! [man] I told you! [Clayton] Your senses have gone into... [Ellen] I swear, it was like she was in here. [Clayton] Into overdrive. You told me I could reach security if I dialed 11. That's what security told me. Did you hit the right button? - [scoffs] - Okay, I'll talk to someone. Do yourself a favor, focus on this side of the wall. And if you hear anything else, Seattle's finest. I was thinking we could brave the lunch crowds and take a walk to the water. No. Sure. Can hit like a train if you're not ready... world outside. World inside. [car alarm blaring] [car honking] [siren wailing] [dramatic music] [exhales sharply] [doorbell rings] [dramatic music] [wind whooshing] [intense music] [Ellen] Why would she leave her balcony open on such a windy day? Okay, so this program... Maybe she couldn't get to it. ...your Internet, your email... Maybe she was incapacitated. Okay. Where do you get these ideas? Uh, so hit return to start and stop, that'll read your email. [automated response] To Ellen Ashland, from Easton Ashland. I'm writing you from another rainy night in Tokyo. [laptop key clicks] [laptop keys clacking] [automated response] Want to learn this or not? Bo. Mo. [laptop keys clacking] [automated response] Duck you. Okay, let's go to voice command mode. Voice command mode? - So, why this line of work? - Um... [Ellen] The money can't be good enough to put up with me. My mother... she was sick since I was little. Couldn't get out of bed. My dad didn't have to work, like me, inheritance. So the only thing he ever really got good at was drinking. When you grow up that way, looking after her, and losing her to that... you wanna make yourself useful. [Ellen] Your imagination get you through? She'd pass the days by making bird cages from her bed. These huge, ornate things. And if it was exotic, she had to have it. African Greys, macaws. I'd give them names and personalities. I'd make my sister act out all these stories with me. The whole flock. But it's-it's weirder still, the job's not so different now. Every client requires something tailor-made. Mr. Neilson in Ballard gets one Clayton, Mrs. Woodsen on the water requires another. And part of me just feels I have to be all these things for all these people. And which Clayton do I get? Uh, that's the scary part. I think you get me. [mellow music] What are we looking at? Um... There's a couple walking their sheep dog past a car that's been parallel parking since the Ice Age. But looking up, countless windows. Can I see you? [music continues] [elevator bell dings] Oh, it's half-past two. I should go. Uh... Sorry, I didn't... - Speak. - From Easton Ashland. [automated response] How are you settling in? I'm going to find a weekend to fly home. Stop. [knocking on door] [Ellen] Who is it? [Lana] You left me a note? - [Lana] Next door. - [dramatic music] I'm Lana. Brought tea. I don't... I can't see. I'm Ellen. Come in. I'll put some water on. Fancy art. Matches the music. You know I used to play? Mm, classical stuff I heard. Russo's got a painting like this one. - Wasn't cheap. - Russo? My husband. You just got here, hm? It's just temporary for me here. My brother's in business on Japan... My brother's in business... - [lighter clicks] - You mind if I... Not inside, thanks. - Nobody smokes in this city. - Even my brother quit. Otherwise you'd have a cancer partner when he visits... Smoking partner. [lighter clicks] Excuse me? You said smoking partner. Here. Well, I said my brother. - I miss him. - Think he misses you? Of course he does. He must. W-why? Did it... Did it hurt? What? Your eyes, losing 'em. I didn't lose them. Your sight, I-I mean. I didn't lose anything. It was taken from me. I, I didn't mean... I should probably... How'd you know I ever had my sight? I didn't, it's just I wondered who put those bruises there. You're right, it's none of my business. - Oh, I didn't say that. - No. - I'm making another mess. - What do you mean, mess? - Nothing, it's nothing. - What do you mean, mess? I know you heard me scream. My husband goes out of town sometimes and I get sad. - [sobbing] - You're shaking. [sniffles] How old are you? None of your business. Forty eight. Why are you lying to me? - [intense music] - [gasps] Don't trust anyone. [dramatic music] - [door opens and shuts] - Wait. - Wait! - [elevator bell dings] It's him. - [kettle whistling] - [Lana gasps] Yes. A scar. Fresh stitches. Her husband did that to her. - [Clayton] I met him. - When? [Clayton] Today. Left your place as he was getting in. He asked if I was seeing the guest in 902. He seemed nice enough. [scoffs] Of course, he did. When she saw him, you didn't hear the fear in her voice. He apologized for the noise. He said his wife hadn't been well. Well, he speaks for her, and you just believe him? [scoffs] Exactly. [dial pad beeping] [line ringing] [Bryce] Detective Bryce. [elevator bell dings] [indistinct radio chatter] [doorbell ringing] - [door opens] - [Nieman] Hi there. Uh, my name's Officer Nieman. I'm responding to a noise complaint at this address. [Bryce on phone] Officer Nieman said she was lucid, calm. Didn't convey she was in danger. She was terrified. [Bryce] I did a little digging, and I'll confide. Mrs. Latch has a bit of a history. - She's hurt herself before. - I-I heard her scream. She came to me frightened. The... The stitches? Stitches? - Her face. - Her scar? Long healed, or so Nieman says. Thought it was a birthmark. No. I know what I felt. - How old is she? - Nieman said 48. She didn't tell you he hit her. She said, "Don't trust anyone." Does that sound like a well person to you? [beeps] - [car honking] - [car alarm blaring] [doorbell ringing] Two days ago. The same car, same alarm, same time. How do you know? Happened right when you got here, 11 a.m. Heard the alarm as you rang the bell. - [lighter clicks] - Same siren? Alarm. Forget it. Look, I believe you. It's a big city, it's got lots of alarms. You heard it all the way up here? - Overdrive. - Yeah. Uh, where do you want this lighter? I don't. It's not mine. I mean, it was just sitting right here. [automated response] 10:57 a.m. 11:02 a.m. - [car alarm blaring] - [keys jingling] - [car honking] - [door shuts] - [knocking on door] - [Clayton] You hungry? Shh! Get in here. - [car alarm blaring] - [car honking] What kind of car? Hey, you were right. - It's the same time? - [car alarm stops] Why'd it stop? Some guy's getting in. Same time every other day. Looking for patterns where there are none. It is a pattern. I get here for my job as he takes off for his. Hey, you've got to take it easy on yourself. Okay? The thing that saves you isn't out there or at the bottom of a cocktail glass. It's, uh, here. [exhales] [sighs] Your eyes won't ever be what they were. But once the rest of you heals, you won't need them to. [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [exhales sharply] [gasps] [Ellen] Ah! Help me. - [spraying] - [screams] [music continues] [dramatic music] [music continues] [automated response] Search results for Russo Latch. Image results for Russo Latch. Video results for Russo Latch. [elevator bell dings] Can I apologize for the other day? Are you all right? Hey. - [gasps] - What? I'm sorry, I... You're her husband, aren't you? I can hear you breathing. Answer me! Speak! [automated response] Search results for Russo Latch. Image results for Russo Latch. Video... I know she was here. - Don't come any closer. - Oh, shut up. Guess it was too much to ask for a normal neighbor. Think I'll speak to building management about the policy on intrusive resident behavior, because, personally, I feel like this place is better off with one less paranoid bitch. [door shuts] - [telephone ringing] - [gasps] [breathing heavily] Yes? [Clayton] I've been outside the past half an hour, working up the nerve to call. He was here. Just now. - What? - He threatened me. I'll talk to him right God-damn now. No! Just... Wait. You were outside working up the nerve to do what? - Ellen, what did he say to you? - The nerve to call... - And tell me what? Clayton! - Nothing. I can't accept payment from you as your caretaker. I-I can't work for you if I have feelings for you. [Ellen sighs] Look, it's-it's unprofessional, I know. But it's the truth, and that's what you deserve. I can't have you relying on me. You can call it a crush, you can call it whatever you want... I'll call you an asshole. - Please, just... - For making me say this. I... I like the Ferrari. We can still do the same things. I can help you. I can make sure that you're safe. Starting with the asshole next door. We can do that as friends or maybe, maybe something more. Oh, you're... [gasps] I can't. I've been wrong about everything. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't... I'm sorry. About next door, about you. We have got to start over professionally. I need to rely on you more than whatever this is. Ellen, I made a mistake. Don't... - [door shuts] - [keys jingling] [thunder rumbling] [line ringing] [Sasha on voicemail] Hi, you've reached Sasha. - I'll get back to you. - [voicemail beeps] [thuds] [Ellen] Clayton? I'm sorry. I don't know how to do this. I can't get a hold of anyone, no one visits me. Please stay. Don't make me apologize twice. Clayton? [gasps] What do you want? Clayton? [screams] Clayton! [panting] [groans] - [screams] - [woman on phone] 9-1-1. What's the nature of your emergency? [whimpering] [siren wailing] [man] Ellen. I'm a paramedic. Ellen? Ellen, can you hear me? You were bleeding from your wrist, but I bandaged you up. Are you feeling all right? Your neck? It hurts? Not seeing anything. Are you looking at it? [scoffs] I'll be right back. [door shuts] [door opens] I shouldn't have left you. - Oh. - What happened? Hey. It's okay. You're all right. Hey, Detective Bryce drove in. I told him about next door. No, it wasn't him. It was the man from that night. [sighs] Do you need to tell me anything before you talk to him? You've been drinking. I've been worried about the drinking. - We've all felt lost at some... - Get away from me. No, Ellen, no. Stop. Do you know where they'd take you? Do you really wanna be anywhere but here in your condition? - He wants to talk to you alone. - Then get him. And get everyone else out of here. [thunder rumbling] It's just the front door. No sign of forced entry. Clayton locked it behind him. I heard it lock and unlock. Usually, the one I would suspect here is the caretaker of the blind woman he... It wasn't him, either. I said usually. How long have you known Sasha Krenlin? - Three years. - Rather... How well do you know her? She's a good friend. The boot treads we pulled from beside your car were half a shoe size smaller than yours. After I first spoke to Ms. Krenlin, we haven't been able to locate her. Left town in a rush. But not without leaving ample shoe-prints outside her property. I'm gonna ask you to guess what size they were. What are you saying? A restraining order was taken out against her, six years ago, Vancouver, for stalking a co-worker's wife. Charges were filed. Aggravated assault. - She couldn't. - But she has reason to. Oh, my God. [Bryce] This is not your fault. But tonight... She was wearing that mask again. - You saw it? - I heard it. I heard her breathing through it. That mask was the last thing I ever saw and it'll be the first thing you see when you review the security footage. [Bryce] I have. For the hallway, lobby, stairwells. Your caretaker left this unit at 8:05 p.m. Few minutes later, he let himself back in with a man from lobby security after 9-1-1 dispatch alerted them of your call. - And? - Cameras show no one else... Coming into this unit tonight. By all accounts, you've been alone. You just said it was her. That night, we think. But tonight someone broke in here, attacked me again! My God, next door, ask them. They told me they heard nothing. No shared wall with this room. The vent. They were playing my music. You know that? Look, there's either a glitch with the camera or... She was in here! She could've come in through the balcony. We reviewed the tapes from the roof. The space above you is empty. I can't do this. This intruder didn't enter by force, didn't take anything, didn't say anything. Did they? That window doesn't make a sound. I hear the same alarm at the same time. Lana's stitches. Now no one believes me. I can't... This is what she wants, isn't it? I'll let you rest, and I'll check the cameras again. Thank Mr. Haley for going to bat for you. Without him, I'd recommend you be put on suicide watch. And if I may offer the simplest explanation, in your virgin state of being sightless, perception won't always be reality. [thunder rumbling] [door shuts] Perception is my only reality. I'm sorry. Didn't mean to wake you. Make it up to you with an omelet? Take the day off. I'm going to... call my brother. We've all felt lost at some point? Drop by later? Make a special take-care-of-you dinner? [door opens] [door shuts] [door locking] [intense music] Easton, you were right about my marriage, and I was wrong to put this distance between us. I'm sorry to do this to you. But it has nothing to do with you. Clayton, we've hardly come to know one other... and you deserve someone stronger than I am. [Ellen] Forgive me for bringing you into this. Sasha... I chose not to see what he was doing, stealing from you. Maybe I've had a hand in what you've done to me... but may you pay for what you've done. I know I am... I'm afraid to fall asleep at night, terrified of the days in between, unable to convince anyone of anything I believe... even myself... which is what scares me most. [mellow music] Next door... Lana might be in trouble. Maybe now someone who can make sense of it, will... because I can't. Not while I'm locked in my own head like a house with no windows... where any truth I look for... I can't find. [music continues] I'm sorry. And... goodbye. [siren wailing] [groans] [groans] [horn blaring] [intense music] [horn blaring] [breathing heavily] [siren wailing] [whimpering] [music intensifies] [sobbing] [car alarm blaring] [car lock beeps] [whimpering] [creaking] [horn blaring] [grunting] [intense music] [breathing heavily] [grunts] [breathing heavily] [sobbing] [breathing heavily] [sobbing] [muffled screaming] [doorbell ringing] [elevator bell dings] - Clayton. - Ellen. - How are you? - Your husband around? He's waiting for me down in the lobby. Down in the lobby? Trouble finding your keys? [sighs] In here somewhere. Think I'd have heard them by now. You know... it was nothing, anyway. Unless there's something I can help you with. You left something at my place. - [lighter clanks] - Darn. - Give me a hand, would you? - [water sloshing] I went over the balcony. Lana, what is this place? Home. There are hidden cameras, aren't there? Microphones? - Lana. - Of course. And to make phone calls? Sasha, my brother, where did he think he was sending me? - Why are you helping them? - What? Clayton, and the men helping him. How many of them are there? Why are they doing this? I-i-it's all for you. W-what did I do to them? To-to them? You saved them. I have to go. Wait. - How do I get out of here? - [doorbell ringing] [knocking on door] - Honey. - [Russo] What're you doing here? - Sorry. - Car's waiting. [Lana] Let's go. Goodbye, Ellen. [door shuts] - [keys jingling] - [door unlocks] - Who's there? - [door shuts] It's your personal chef. One special dinner coming up. Going to take care of me? If you'll let me. Your hand. Can I take a look at that? [metal clanking] Do I have to ask if that's an accident? Is this about Lana? I think it'd be wise if you had less interaction with her. You saw her just now with her husband? I think if we look out the window right now, we'll see them getting into their car? I'd assume they'd be gone by now. He told me they're going up north for a few weeks. He's taking her away, Russo, or whatever his name is, because she was about to tell me more. What are you going to do to her? - What? - What else? - Ellen... - Detective Bryce. That cop, Nieman, you've all been lying to me since the moment you brought me here. Maybe we should call your brother or your doctor. This place is a fucking lie, and I wanna know why! Lana wasn't taken anywhere. - Her husband checked her out. - What? They're re-evaluating her treatment. And next they're gonna talk about re-evaluating yours. - Treatment? - What do you think this is? - Ellen, Alcatraz? - People visit Alcatraz. - What did Lana tell you? - This was all for me. Patients like you and her, paid for by your brother. You told me you see patients all over the city! Yeah, because I do, this isn't the only program that I work for. You stood at that window and told me all about the world out there! Of course I did, with you. - To make it as real as possible. - You're lying. To ease your transition back into the real world, no matter how unorthodox it may feel... - Stop lying! - You suffer from PTSD... And you're newly blind. Is that a lie? Ellen, I'm sorry about this downturn in your recovery, really, I am. I failed you. - But that doesn't... - I don't believe you! All this place is, is to keep you safe. - I tried to kill myself! - You tried. Ellen, you are hurt. You need help. You're right. I need help. That's what we're here for. [sobbing] [sniffles] I'll freshen up before dinner. [Clayton] I'll get started on that and the surprise that makes it special. [exhales sharply] [sniffles] [water sloshing] [cutlery clanking] [Clayton] Have a seat. [intense music] [clattering] Put out your hands. Had it tuned and everything. I don't know what to say. Say nothing. Try playing. Why did you ever stop? My husband. But if there was ever a way back to her... isn't this it, to that... original Ellen? This is all part of the treatment? - You know any of my music? - Oh, sure. Your rendition of the... - Kreutzer Sonata. - Kreutzer Sonata. [oven beeping] - Back in two blinks. - [knocks] [intense music] - Back in two blinks. - [knocks] Usually, the one I'd suspect here is the caretaker of the blind woman. Wasn't him, either. - I said usually. - [knocks] My mother, she was sick since I was little. Is that really necessary? She'd pass the days by making bird cages from her bed. [Clayton] I'd give them names, personalities. Part of me just feels I have to be all these things for all these people. [echoing] The whole flock. - Is that really necessary? - I'm not sure. Doctors on TV do it. - Back in two blinks. - [knocks] I'm a paramedic. Ellen, can you hear me? The one I'd suspect here is the caretaker of the blind woman. [screaming] I feel like this place is better off with one less paranoid bitch. And which Clayton do I get? That's the scary part. I think you get me. Don't trust anyone. [Clayton] You look like you've seen a ghost. Exactly what I was thinking. - Listen... - Drinks? It's a special dinner, isn't it? Have a seat. [Clayton] Before the food cools off. Didn't tell you, did I? Finished your story. The Veldt. Had the computer read it to me, anyway. There's hope for you yet. Didn't even know the Veldt meant the plains in Africa. So that's what the kids want, and their house brings it to life, in the nursery. The heat, the tall grass. - And that ending? - The lions. Kind of depraved, isn't it? Don't you think? What? That the kids lock mom and dad in the nursery? Or that the lions eat mom and dad? No, that the kids watch it happen... with smiles on their faces. Parents got what they deserved. - I'm sorry. - I got it.

[beeping] [music continues] [whimpering] Lana? - [clanking] - [whimpering] [intense music] [Clayton] Ellen! Where are you? - [whimpers] - Wait. [Lana] You didn't kill him, did you? No. Which is why we have to get out of here. You have to help me. I told you. This is home. Lana, what are you talking about? He's all the family I have. [Ellen] You're his sister? This isn't what you want. You tried to warn me. I tried to stay quiet, but we got you here. You were so real. You can't save me like you saved him. - What did I save him from? - Where you are now. The dark. - [clattering] - [whimpering] [Clayton] Ellen! I know what it feels like to be under someone else's control. Believe me, I've been there. But I'm going to take my hand away. We're going to get out of here, and he never gets to hurt you again. - [alarm beeping] - [whimpers] Only one way out. - For one of us. - No, together. Go back the way you came. There's a vent in his room. I hid it from him. The only way out. Go. Go, or I'll scream. [alarm beeping] [clanking] [whimpering] [whimpering] [gasps] [grunts] [intense music] [groaning] [groaning] Clayton, what happened to you? Everything changed the day my mother died. My father made us watch as he smashed her bird cages with the birds still inside. That made me angry. So he... dragged me by my hair into the cellar, and he locked me down there for three-and-a-half years. My only lifeline to the outside was my imagination. And when I thought there was no end in sight... what I heard in the walls and the vents, what my sister would play for me, when she could sneak it... the same music I used to listen to with my mother. My music? My music? And you would never know that you were the light for me in that black hole, until I could be the same for you. I had this place built for you... but you made it real. And now you'll have to believe in it again, as you did before. Where you are is in your head. It doesn't have to be Seattle outside the windows, either. I can take you anywhere. And I can be... anyone. Everyone. [air gushing] I'll make it real. Me and you. [Clayton sighs] And only you. What? How else can I know you're real? That Clayton isn't part of... They belong to me. I don't belong to them. You would have me, what, get rid of them? You can't, can you? They were all you had in the dark. - [gasps] - You, you were all I had! Then help me, Clayton. Be that original Ellen. Why can't the man I'm falling for be himself with me? And only himself? [intense music] - [Clayton] Ellen! - [grunting] [music continues] [grunting] [grunting] [clattering] [music continues] [wind whooshing] [grunting] - [spraying] - [screaming] The only way out. [alarm blaring] [Clayton] Ellen? - Ellen? Ellen! - [gasping] [intense music] [groaning] [grunting] [groaning] Back in the cage, little bird. [whimpering] What did you do? [coughing] [Clayton groaning] [groaning] [grunting] [Clayton screams] [Clayton groaning] [whimpers] [Clayton groaning] [Clayton] No, no, no... - Clayton. - Lana? [Clayton] Where is she? Where is she? Where's Ellen? You let her go. Give her back to me. Give her back. You don't leave me. You promised you wouldn't leave me. You promised you wouldn't leave me. [breathing heavily] Not like this, not like this. Don't leave me. What's happening? What's happening? What's happening? Help!
