She says she don't want to be bothered. -Oh, okay. -She don't want to be... Mama, what's going on? Nothing. l wanna see all my family. -Oh, Joyce! -Ma'am! Come on back, baby. She says she wanna see All in the Family l thought she said All My Children. No, no, no. l'm talking about my family, Tammy and them. l want all of them to come over here so l can tell them what the doctor said. -That's right. Joyce! -Ma'am. Come on, put the remote back, baby. She says she wanna see all her family. -Okay. -She wanna see all y'all. Wait a minute, wait a minute... Even Monroe? Yes. You want your brother Monroe to come over here? -Joyce! -Ma'am! Listen here, baby. Get my purse out of that closet. lt's behind that big box, in a little box, wrapped up in my coat, hanging on a hanger. What do you want me to do with it? -Hide it, hide it. -Hide it? Yeah. Didn't you hear her say Monroe was coming over here? -l better hide my purse, too. -Yeah, you better. Mama, l'm gonna clean up your room after l get dinner started, okay? Well, thank you. l don't know what l'd do without you. You know what?

She gone back in there? -What? Hey, look here. You know why that is, don't you? She loves her mama. No. lt's 'cause she ain't got no man. -She's shy. -Shy? Okay, shy. Listen, Shirley, shy is gonna keep her lonely. Listen, there are three ways you know when somebody is just lonely past help, and the first way is, they get to saying, ''l'm just happy with Jesus alone. ''He's all l need.'' -She don't say that. -Yes, she does. She said it last week when l was talking to her. You ain't heard her say it? You ain't heard her say it? -Joyce? -Ma'am! Oh, baby, when you going to get a man? No, Aunt Bam, l'm happy with Jesus alone. He's all l need. Number two, then they get defensive. ''l can get a man if l want. l can get a man if l want.'' Now, she said that yesterday, when l was talking to her... You ain't heard that? -Lookit! Joyce? -Ma'am! Baby, you need a man. Now, look now... Now, l could get a man if l wanted one. l just don't want one. Ain't nobody in this house got a man. l don't know why everybody worry about whether Joyce's got a man or not. As a matter of fact, you know what? l do have a man. His name is Jesus, and l love him! Joyce, Joyce, baby, let it go. Oh, God, she's a case study. But you know what, Shirley? She ain't done number three yet, so l ain't too worried about her. -What's that? -You know, when they get all depressed, then they get to singing hymns. Hymns just pop out of nowhere. What a friend we have in Jesus -AII our... -AII our... She's suicidal. Oh, she ain't suicidal. Yes, yes. Child, this don't make no sense. Somebody be 32 years old, ain't had a man in years. Leave that child alone. Some people are happy alone, some folks blossom late in life. She's a beautiful flower. Yeah. Well, a dead cactus is a beautiful flower to somebody. But you don't see me running out to go buy one. Listen, Shirley, you need some help with these children here, and l had to call somebody, but l know y'all kind of different in the way y'all raise children and everything. But l called her, she said she'd come on over here and you just need some help. And what l need... Hey! -Hey, there she is! -lt's so good to see you. How you doing, Shirley? Good to see you. -Bam! -Bam! Y'all still do that. Yes, indeed. l came as soon as y'all called me. -l'm glad you're here. -l know you know me. You have different styles of raising children. -You like to pray for them and lay hands. -Yes, that's right. l like to punch them and kick them, so we'll figure out somewhere in the middle. -We gonna work it out. -Yes, Lord. But l came. You don't look sick at all. Well, l feel good. Good. You look good. You look good. Your house look good, too. -Well, thank you. -lt's so clean. -Yep. -Joyce still ain't got a man, does she? l bet she run to New Birth. Every time the door swings open, she's up in there. Well, you know, all of us go to New Birth. -Yeah! -All of us. Not Bam. -Yes, she does. -Bam don't go to no church. -Yes, l do go to church. -Bam, stop that lying. You don't go to no church. All the hell you did back in the day, now you running to the church house? Yeah, l do go to church, girl. Listen to me, l had to run up in that church. l ran up in that church... You stop that lying. You'd have said three lies just that quick. Stop that lying. Hey, you gotta let me finish talking, babe. l ain't even said the whole story yet. -Say what you're saying. -l said... l ran up in that church... Stop that lying. l'd have heard three lies just that quick. Stop that lying. -The lying about the church. -Mable... -Mable, what... -Say it slow. -Okay. l... -Say it. Lie. -Ran... -You know that's a lie. -Up in... -That's a big old lie right there. ''l ran up.'' You ain't run up nowhere. You might have rolled down somewhere, but you ain't run up. You ain't run up to nowhere. Girl, l didn't know y'all know him. -Who you talking about? -That dude in the kitchen. Ain't no man in that kitchen. That ain't Sam Jackson from Pulp Fiction at your stove? That's my baby. -l know that's Joyce. Hey, Joyce! -Hey, Aunt Madea. Girl, she sounds so lonely. lt's all in her throat. Y'all better watch her. Come here. Let me take a look at you, hon. -Oh, okay. -She looked the same. No, she don't all these years. -Hey. -Yes, she do. That Afro exfoliated me. Good God. Sorry. Sorry. Come here.

Hey, hey! And here come Thriller. Tammy, l paid your husband $275 to fix my car. No, don't say no ''Thank you, thank you.'' My car still ain't fixed. l'm telling you, where your husband at? -He at work. -Y'all lazy as hell. -ls he coming over here? -Yes, he is. lf l go out this door today and my car don't start, you better run like hell. That's all l'm saying. lf l go out there and turn that key, somebody gonna be turning you over in your grave. l'm telling you right now. -My car better start. -Yes, ma'am. -Hey, Aunt Bam. -Hey, Thriller. -Hey, Byron. -Hey, Aunt B.

See, God, that what l be talking about right here. When you want me to act right, people always... You better be glad Bam is going to church, 'cause there was a time Bam would have took that $20, went to the Laundromat, got some quarters, put it in a sock, and beat the hell out of you with it. Anyway. Hello, Miss Shirley. -Hey, honey. -Hey, Mama, can l talk to you for a minute? Okay.

Don't mess with me. -Wait. Hold on. Get back... Man, that girl talk to you the way Tammy be talking to me. Excuse me, and who is talking to you? l don't think nobody said anything to Harold up in here. -Did anybody say anything to him? -Not a word. -l don't even like the way he looks. -l didn't say nothing to that stingy midget. You know what? l know we had this discussion before we came over here, and l said, ''Don't you open up your mouth.'' And here you go, you whiney wimp of a man, opening up your doggone mouth. Now, l'm gonna say this, and you better listen real good. Shut up! And don't say nothing. That's embarrassing as hell. Y'all come on in the kitchen, we need to have us a man moment, anyway. Come on. Y'all don't move fast unless somebody's hollering at you. -Get in the kitchen! -Monroe... You can't scare me like that. l can't believe y'all. Sit down somewhere. Now, look, you did the right thing by not going off on her when she was going off on you, but let me tell you something. After you've done all you can, you just stand and start choking the hell out of her. l mean, put your thumb to the back of her throat, then you drop her on the floor and watch her spit up on herself. And then you stand over and you go, ''Yah, trick!'' Just like that. And, Harold, when you get home, you tell Tammy, ''Tammy, get upstairs, ''and let me tell you something.'' Now, you try it. Go ahead. Tammy, will you come upstairs so l can tell you something, please? That rottweiler's gonna tear you up. Now, come on. Don't tell Harold nothing like that, man. -Tammy is your niece. -And? And you need to be more responsible and respectful. Look, man, l love my wife. And l know she's got a few issues, but l'm gonna help her work through them, like a real man who loves his woman should. Thank you, Pastor Joel Osteen. Now, when you get through with all that prayer and supplements, you need to go back to step one, ''Yah, trick!'' l'm telling you, there's a connection. Man, me and Tammy ain't had sex in over a year, man. Kill the visual, Jesus. Kill the visual. l mean, my boys at home acting crazy and all out of control. My mommy and daddy are sick. How am l gonna deal with Tammy in times like these, man? -''Yah, trick!'' -''Yah, trick!'' l'm telling you, it worked with my first three wives. You gotta try it. Yeah, try it. Yah, trick! That's if Tammy was under 225. Come on, man. -Yah, trick! -Harder than that, now. -Yah, trick! -Come on, harder. -Yah, trick! -That's it, that's it. Now, this time, over your right shoulder, as hard as you can. Okay. Yah, trick... Oh, God. -Uncle Monroe? -Ma'am. -What y'all doing? -Bible study. Yeah. Jason was about to do praise and worship. No, l wasn't... Oh, l was! -Kumbaya, my Lord, kumbaya -Kumbaya lt sound like l hear The Lion King coming out of the kitchen. You know, a-wimoweh up in there. What's going on? That's them having Bible study, and praise and worship. Ain't nobody having no Bible study. Stop that lie. Every time somebody say ''praise and worship,'' your mama want the boys to sing. l get so sick of hearing the boys sing. Every time l come over, she say, ''Y'all, let the boys sing.'' l want y'all to sing a Gospel song. Come on. And this one sing slow. -He's much better now. -Son, son. Son, son. Walk over here, son. Now, stop and pull up your pants. Now, walk back. -lt's a miracle. -That's my baby. l don't know what's wrong with y'all young boys, with these pants hanging off your behind, down to your knees.

Here's the thing, ain't nobody gonna give you no job like that, ain't nobody gonna hire you like that, 'cause you look like a fool, son. You look like a fool. Pull your pants up. Why don't some young men pull their pants up and say, ''Follow me, l'm pulling my pants up''? Everybody got their pants down, following the jackass with his pants down. Boy, let me tell you something. Pants on the ground Got your pants on the ground Looking like a fool with your pants on the ground Hat turned around with the gold in your mouth Madea, a remix, what? -l did a remix. -That's right. -That's a hit. -Do it again.

That child says, ''Hold that thought.'' Lord, have mercy. Kim, Mama's trying to tell us something. Now, l know you didn't answer the doggone phone while Mama's trying to tell us something. -Tammy, leave me alone. -And what you gonna do if l don't? Don't test me, all right?

Honey, l'm sorry. l'm sorry you had to find out like you found out. And l'm sorry that you had to find out what you found out. But, son, sometimes in life, you have to find things out so you realize you done found them out. See, you got to find things out, honey, because sometimes you don't know what you didn't know. But then, when you find out things, then you already start finding out what you didn't know. Then, when you found out what you didn't know, then you already did and you start knowing what you didn't know. And then it don't make no sense to find out things no more, because then you already found out what you didn't know. But it's always good, because when you don't know something you didn't know, you don't know it until you find it out. -Then when you find it out you realize... -Aunt Bam... l know. l'm deep. l know. l know. l wasn't going to say that. Quit smoking all that weed. You're the reason l'm so slow! Well, l'm glad you found that out. See? Now you know. See that? Look at that. You're so smart, honey. Stay with it. Stay with it.

Karen, what are you doing here? Because that's my baby's grandmother. That's why l'm here. This is a funeral! Come on, y'all! Sit the hell down! Boy, if you have sex with a woman, it is possible for her to get pregnant. Did anybody tell you that? Apparently, you did not know anything about a bird or a bee. So, whatever the hell it was you was attracted to for them five or six minutes, you need to think over for the next 1 8 years to get through raising this child. This girl tell me you out there selling dope. Oh, yeah. She's a snitch. You selling dope? l don't know what's wrong with you young folks. Something happened to y'all born after the '80s. Like, all the children born around the '80s feel like somebody's supposed to give something to you. You don't want to go out and earn nothing. Nothing in this life comes easy, son. Get a job. You have been tricked by this bling-bling, by the music, by the business, by the videos. You have been tricked, son. Get a job. Ain't nothing wrong with going to work. Anything that come into your life fast is going to leave even faster, son. Get a job. Go to work. You have been tricked. Do you hear what l'm telling you? Selling dope... Let me tell you something. That's going to lead you to one of two places. That's to the grave or to the prison. You already been to jail. And as soon as you go down, she's going to be sold to the highest bidder. -Do you understand what l'm telling you? -What? You have been tricked, son. You have been tricked. l hope you hear me. You have been tricked! Get a job! Go to work and earn it. This is a test of the emergency broadcast system! Trying to get through your young, thick skull that you have been tricked. Get a job. That's right! -What's your name? -Karen Jackson. l'm coming up Jackson Street in just a minute. l'm talking to him right now. What l know about these dope boys, they got a little bit of sense. Because if you know how to cut it, slice it, weigh it, have this one running here, this one doing that, this one over here doing that, hide it from the police. lf you can put all of that energy into selling dope, that tell me you can put that same amount of energy into running a legitimate business and going straight. Get a job, son. Go to work. And, you. Whatever he won't do, you do. Stop using that baby to make this man's life miserable. lt got real quiet in here now. So, l'm going to say it again because l feel like l'm talking to somebody in this section over here. Stop using that baby to make that man's life miserable. The man don't want you. You can't get to what's in front of you because you're too busy looking back to see what the hell he doing. Do you hear what l'm telling you? This is not your future, this is your past. Leave this alone. Whatever he do with her, that ain't your business. Move on. Get to what God got for you and leave this where it's at. Do you hear me? And whatever he won't do, you do. Get a job. -l got a job. -Doing what? l work at the Serenade Cafe and l help my mama at the beauty shop, and l go to cosmology school. That is so ignorant. l want to punch the hell out of you. That is ignorant. That word is not ''cosmology.'' Who told you that? That's so stupid! l ain't never heard nobody be that stupid saying a word. That is stupid. There are two ''R's'' in that word, honey. You have to pronounce that word... The word is ''cos-mer-toler-gy-ster.'' -Say it. -Cos-mer-toler-gy. Yes. Now you sound educated. Like you went to school at DeKalb County. -Yes. -Thank you. -That's right. -Thank you. Wow. This is really cute, but it's time to go. Let's be out, Byron. l want to see you walk the hell out of here when l'm talking to you. -Did he just get up? Monroe, did he get up? -Yes, ma'am. -He just got up, didn't he? And l'm talking... -Yes, ma'am. You young folks so disrespectful. Try that again, honey. Please. Come on, Byron, let's be out. l don't know what's wrong with y'all young people today. They got old people. Y'all ain't showing no respect for the old folks at all. The elders are here for a reason. They can teach you something. This is the only country where we throw old people away. That's where the wisdom is. You not going to sit here and disrespect me like... l see these young folks, old people sitting at the bus stop, young folk pants hanging down, cussing, spitting, acting like the old people ain't sitting there, forgetting that old people marched for your dumb ass. You should act like you got some sense in here. l can teach you, in five seconds flat, what your mama and daddy did not. Honey, l come from a school where you said, ''Yes, ma'am. No, ma'am. ''Yes, sir, or, no, sir,'' or you got your teeth knocked out of your mouth. You learn some respect. Now, let me tell you this, honey. Hear me clearly when l say this. Keep it up. l might have silver hair, but l also have silver bullets. Do you want one? -Look, Byron is... -You better take all that ''ook'' out the back of your throat when you talk to me, girl. lt's okay, Madea. lt's okay. What you say? Look, Byron is 22 years old, all right? -Twenty-two is not grown... -Yes, it is! lnterrupt me one more time. Twenty-two is not grown. lt is legal, but it ain't grown. Until you get somewhere around 39 or 40, you not even going to understand how stupid you were at 22 years old. Shut up. -Well, in my book, it's grown, all right? -How old are you, honey? -l'm 22 as well. -You're dumb-as-hell as well, too. You're in danger, Molly. You're in danger. You're in danger, Molly. -l'm in danger? -Yes. Molly's so scared of you, old lady. Now... Now look, all of you in here need to learn how to let my man grow up and be a man. Yah, trick! She got her. She got her. Yes. What? -At some point you got to let her go, Madea. -This ain't that point yet. Come here. Sit down. Sit down. -She's crazy. She's crazy. -Lose your demon. Look... -He hit you that hard? -That hard, Madea. Okay. Okay. -Madea? -Yes. -This right here? -Yes. -This is my girlfriend. -Yes. And l am a grown man... -Oh, my God. -She hit you that hard. This woman... You a grown man? Shut up, demon. You ain't no grown man. Grown man take care of his child without anybody telling him he need to take care of his child. A grown man is so secure in himself he will go flip burgers to make sure his baby can eat. A grown man is so secure in himself he will pick up sanitation for 30 years to make sure his child can go to college. A grown man is so secure in himself, to make sure his family have what they need, he will stand on this stage in a dress. What? Now look here. l want to see a settlement on this paper. l wanna know who gonna have the baby, when you gonna have the baby, who gonna pick him up, who gonna bring him to daycare, who gonna have him on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, who gonna have him on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, who gonna alternate weekends. When is the money coming, who gonna buy the Similac and the Pampers? l wanna see it written down. You better be F. Lee Bailey and you better be Johnnie damn Cochran. Write it down right now. And let me tell you something. Stop all that arguing and fussing with this man. People with power don't do all that arguing. lf he won't do right, lock his ass up. What? l'm sick of this here. l told your mama, l said, ''Let me talk to them children.'' She said, ''No, no, no, l'm just gonna pray for them.'' The Bible say, ''Faith without works is dead.'' You can't just sit around praying, you got to do something, too. Like you two, Eddie and Gerald Levert. l said, right there where Joyce-Ann's sitting, ''Listen, you talk to this man like he is worse than an animal under the sea.'' Do not do that, honey. Do not tell your family everything that your husband or your wife is doing. Do not do that. And l'll tell you why. 'Cause you'll tell them when you're mad, then y'all go make up, but then the family's still mad, and you wonder why the hell they don't want him at the barbecue. Shut up sometimes. You used to love this man. You was so in love, you was the homecoming queen, and him playing football, y'all gonna be together forever. Now you've hit this rough patch. l call it ''the traffic jam of life,'' honey. And it usually happens between the age of 40 and 50. That's a rough time. And l'm gonna tell you why. 'Cause if you live long enough, you gonna go through some stuff during that decade. And if you're married, it's gonna be double. Let me tell you what happens during that time. You go through menopause. Your husband have a midlife crisis. lf you got teenagers, they act like they have lost their minds. Your parents are sick, dying, you're trying to take care of them. His parents are sick and dying, Alzheimer's, all that stuff is going on. Y'all trying to do all that within them 1 0 years. That's enough to drive any marriage apart. That's not the time to be pulling apart, that's the time to come together. Do you understand? Yeah. All that fussing and arguing and all that stuff. No. Hell, that's why you took the vows, for better or worse. Sometimes worse is as bad as hell. That's why l tell folks, just make it through them 1 0 years. l'm telling you, that is the test of life. People want to get married. ''l just want to be married.'' Hell, throw yourself a party, don't go through all that heartache. Throw yourself a beautiful reception. ''Did you get married?'' ''No, hell, this is the reception. ''Come on. Have a good time.'' Do you understand what l'm saying? Stop it. And listen, the only reason this woman is talking to you like that is cause you let her. Yep. This woman is talking to you like that 'cause you let her. Do you hear me? Don't no woman want no weak, whiny, wimp lump running behind her, ''Baby, l'm sorry. l'm sorry, babycakes.'' No. A woman want a man that's solid. -She want a rock. -Yeah. She wanna know if somebody break in the house at 3:00 in the morning, she ain't got to get up out of the bed. ''Just go on and lay there, baby. l'm gonna go handle this, and l'll be right back. ''l don't want you to get up.'' Do you hear what l'm telling you, son? Put your foot down. Put your foot down. Stop being such a wimp. Put your foot down. And like you, Joyce. You. Man broke your heart years ago, and you put your life in park. Just put your life in park. And a lot of women do that. Get their heart broken, then they don't know what to do, be all sad and miserable. Next thing you know, they're 95 years old, living in a house full of cats, telling everybody, ''Get off my grass!'' 'Cause they got their heart broke. But you was praying a prayer that got your heart broke. When you told me you prayed that prayer, l knew you was gonna get your heart broke. l told your mama, ''Let me talk to her.'' And she said, ''No, she's gonna be all right. No.'' What's that prayer you told me you were praying when l come over here? l was praying for God to send me a good man. Yes, that is a prayer that'll get your heart broke. People think God is crazy. That they could just say something, it's just gonna fall out of the sky. That ain't how it works, honey. You got to be careful what you pray for. And when you pray for something, you gotta know that you wanna go through what it takes to get what you asking for. You ain't with me? You pray a prayer. Let me tell you something. When sometimes you pray a prayer, God will answer the prayer the day you prayed it. lt may take 40 years for it to show up in your life, but the prayer has been answered. You just got to go through what you... lt's like this. You're sitting here, you're trying to get somewhere downtown. You put the address in the navigation system. Now, the satellite is above you, that satellite knows where you are and where you're trying to go. lt tells you, this is where you turn, that's where you turn, do this, do that. But what it don't tell you is that, it don't tell you if somebody gonna be crossing the street, it don't tell you if a water main's gonna break and you gonna have to slow down, it don't tell you if traffic gonna be backed up for 20 miles on 285, it don't tell you none of that. But all it's gonna tell you is where you are and where you trying to go. Do you understand? lt's the same thing when you pray a prayer like that. ''God, send me a good man. God, send me a good man.'' God is looking at you. He know where you are and he know where you trying to go. All you gotta do is follow. You still ain't with me. You say, ''God, send me a good man. God, send me a good man.'' You meet a man, you think he the one. ''Oh, yes. l'm ready.'' You meet him, he break your heart. He's a fool. You don't know what to do. You say, ''Lord, this ain't what l prayed for.'' So, you try it again. You get up the faith and the courage. ''l'm gonna do it again. 'Lord, send me a good man.''' You meet that man. Next man, he come along, he break your heart, too. Two men now broke your heart. You say, ''Okay, God. l'm gonna try it again. l'm gonna try it again.'' You meet another man, that man break your heart. You say, ''l ain't gonna love no more. ''l'm gonna do everything to make myself unattractive. ''l don't want nobody to look at me, 'cause l'm not. ''l can't be hurt no more. l'm done.'' And that's where people mess up. Don't stop. l don't care how many times you get your heart broke, if you pray for something and you believe it's coming, keep trying, keep loving, it's gonna come to you. So, that's all l'm telling you, honey. When you pray that prayer, you gonna get your heart broke. You still ain't with me. All right. Well, let me bring it home for you. So you say, ''God, send me a good man. God, send me a good man.'' You meet all of them, and they done broke your heart. God is saying, ''Listen, l'm up here, up high, above you. l'm watching. ''l know what a man is, he's over here. He ain't perfect, but he perfect for you. ''He done been through some things, so he's there, ready. ''l can't let you get to him right now, 'cause you ain't ready ''and you gonna run him away. ''Cause you can't appreciate up until you've really been down. ''Stay with me forjust a second.'' So you say, ''God, send me a good man. God, send me a good man.'' You've had these three fools. God is saying, ''Yes. But just keep going. ''When you get your heart broke, just keep going.'' 'Cause l promise you, when you get to what God have for you 5-6 years from now, you'll look back at them same people and say, -''Thank you. You taught me something.'' -Yeah. -''l appreciate what you taught me.'' -Yeah. Do you hear me? Keep moving, honey. Keep moving, keep moving, to what God is saying. He is the satellite. He know where you are. He know where you trying to get to. All you got to do is go through them obstacles and them hurdles, and you will get to what's waiting for you on the other side. lf you have faith enough. People just want to stop, they don't wanna keep walking sometimes 'cause it gets too hard. Be careful what you pray for, 'cause if you pray for something and you want it to come to pass, you're gonna have to go through some things to see it through. All right. All right. So that brings me to the question, how bad do you want it? Do you hear what l'm telling you? How bad do you want it? -Do you understand? -Yes, ma'am. -All right, now you got it. -Now l got it. That's right. 'Cause them fools... There's some of you out there sitting with them fools right now. Don't look at him. Look at me. Look at me. And l can always spot them 'cause they sit there like this. He's sitting there mad as hell he bought this ticket right now. l'm telling you, right now. lt's all right. lt's all right. Listen, women know that the man ain't the one. lt's like, ''God used the National Geographic Channel ''to teach me a lesson about women.'' God can use anything to get his word across. Look at me sitting here like this. Hello. But there are two little birds sitting in a nest. Two little lovebirds. And l've watched this, and God ministered to me about this thing. There's a male bird and there's a female bird. And they're just sitting there happy. The male bird is just happy. The female bird's sitting there, she's just happy. Then she gets up and she decides she don't want to be with him no more. -She don't just fly away. -Okay. -She do like a woman. -What? This is what a woman do. She take one little twig out of the nest, fly it to the other side of town where she wanna move, then she fly back. Very patient. Two weeks later she take another twig, fly it to the other side of town. Male bird is just sitting there, just happy as can be, he don't know what's going on. That's just like a woman. She ain't gonna leave one nest till she got another nest built somewhere. l'm telling you, the woman know you ain't the one. You don't believe me? lf you don't believe me, listen. lf you don't believe what l'm telling you, go home and check your bank account. lf you got about $25 missing, that's the twig. She done put it in another account. She's getting ready to fly away. -Tweet, tweet, tweet. -Tweet, tweet, tweet. Do you understand what l'm saying, honey? All right, l want you to hear me. Life is too precious to not have love in your life. Like this child got love all around her. And so mad at the world she don't know what to do. l'm gonna tell you this. Your mama didn't want you to know. This child was raped by your uncle on your daddy's side -when she was 1 2 years old. -Yes, she was. Yeah. Your mama didn't want you to know. l don't like people covering stuff up. Anything that's covered up ain't gonna get healed. That's what's wrong with these families. That's why they all falling apart. You wonder why your children don't get along, why this one don't get along with nobody. Y'all got all these secrets. Stop covering up all of these secrets and talk about it. Get some help. l can't stand people saying, ''What goes on in this house stays in this house.'' No. lf what went on in this house is hurting me, l'm going to get some help, and l don't care who like it or who don't like it. That's all right, honey. That's all right. lt ain't your fault. And you can't sit there thinking it's your fault, honey. And listen to me, let me tell you why you so angry, why you so mad. l told your mama l would talk to you. You're mad and angry at him, screaming at him, screaming at your children, never got no time, fussing at everybody, 'cause you ain't forgave the person that hurt you. Let me tell you something. When somebody do something to you, they take the power out of you. And if you don't forgive them, they keep the power. You say, ''They ain't got no power over me. They just did it.'' No. Let me tell you how they got power over you. You in a good mood, having a good time. You see that person, they walk in the room, your whole mood change. Anybody that can change your atmosphere is somebody that has power over you. You gotta forgive them, honey. Forgive. And let me tell you something, there's power in that forgiveness. Once you learn how to let that thing go, when somebody did something to you and you let it go, it frees you. Do you hear me? The Bible say, ''God can't forgive you until you forgive other people.'' Forgive yourself. Forgive yourself, honey. Can't do none of that till you learn how to love yourself, though. You got to love yourself. Look, l love me some me. You ain't got to call me on my birthday, l won't be offended. l will throw myself a surprise party. Yeah. l'll knock on the door, say, ''Surprise.'' And on the other side say, ''l shouldn't have. Thank me so much.'' Do you hear what l'm telling you, honey? This man trying to love you and all of this other stuff, and you just hollering and screaming at him. l can't stand no woman saying, ''My man don't understand me all these years.'' He ain't never gonna understand you. l'm sorry to tell you, he ain't never, ever... You and your man are never going to communicate in a way that each of you understand each other. l'll tell you why. 'Cause women think up here. And men think... Hallelujah. Do you hear what l'm telling you, honey? Let me tell y'all something. Hear me clearly when l say this, every woman is a little girl at heart, and she is looking for the love of her father. lf she had an awful daddy that didn't treat her right, didn't treat her mama right, didn't treat... She don't know what it's like to have the love of a man. lf you are brave enough and man enough to love that woman, she will come back at you with a love that you ain't never seen before in your life. Look here, it's gonna scare her at first. She ain't gonna know what's going on 'cause she ain't never had it. But if you are honest with her and patient, she will love you like you ain't never been. She'll be down for you like four flat tires, l'm telling you right now. But if you run up on a woman, and you a man who like to run games, and you run up on this woman and she had a good daddy who showed her how a man is supposed to treat a woman, and you sitting there and running all these games, she ain't gonna have it. That woman will sit by herself, 95, in a house full of cats, and happy, before she lets you run some kind of game on her. Go on upstairs and talk to this man. He's trying to figure it out, looking like a dumb deer in headlights every time you holler. Yeah, that's what he looks like, a dumb deer in headlights. You ought to be glad somebody's trying to love you. Y'all don't know this, but l'm off the script. l know it sound like l was on that road and l could dodge in and out, you know what l mean? But l'm gonna say this. All of the women out there who got these interests on their mortgages a few years ago, l want to talk to you. l know you're here 'cause your spirit is heavy. You walked in here just looking for a laugh 'cause you just don't know what to do. You're so stressed out about this econtomy, you don't know what to do. Bought that house and thought, ''God had blessed me a few years ago.'' You was like, ''Yes, God blessed me with a house ''l never thought l'd be able to afford.'' Bucking and jumping up and down church, telling everybody, ''Come see the house that God has given me.'' All right. Now you're sitting there, saying, ''Come see the curse l'm trying to get rid of.'' You tried to refinance it. lt was worth something, it ain't worth that no more, so now they don't want to refinance it. The bank's acting crazy. You just don't know what to do, so you sit there calling on the name of Jesus. You are working on the Lord's nerves just praying so much about this house. ''Lord, please, just help me.'' You're reading your Bible, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, 1 st and 2nd Samuel, 1 st and 2nd Kings, 1 st and 2nd Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Job, Psalm, Proverb, Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon... Every book of the Bible. You're turning on TBN trying to get your answer from Bishop T.D. Jakes. You're turning on another channel trying to get your answer from Joyce Meyer. You're looking at the commercials trying to get your answer from Oscar Mayer. You don't know what to do. You're laying up in the middle of the night, praying like Paul and Silas, laying out prostrate, waiting for an earthquake to happen, to come shake that mortgage loose on the house. You don't know what to do. l want you to know something. lf this is you and you're in this situation, you're just struggling, God told me to tell you something. You thought the answer was gonna come through the bishop, -but it's coming through Madea. Hallelujah. -Watch it, now. -Come on. Come on. -Watch it. Watch it, now. Come on. -Watch it, dear. -lf this is you and you don't know what to do, and you're stressed out and you're struggling, God told me to tell you something. lt's four letters. lt's one word. l want you to get this deep in your spirit. God told me to say... He said, ''Move.'' Move. -There it is. There it is. -Yeah. That's what he said. -He said, ''Move.'' -Move. Hey. ln a deep voice. No, seriously... Let me stop before lightning strike me down. Seriously. You got your health and strength, but you about to let a material thing put you in the hospital. You used to make a dollar out of 1 5 cents, now you're so bougie that you don't even know what to do. Pack up, get out of there, l'm telling you. ''What my friends gonna say?'' They struggling, too, they just don't want you to know it. Pack the hell up. l'm telling you. Ain't nothing worth you being stressed out over no material thing. Let me tell you something. Every business, when they in trouble, the first thing they do is downsize. You will be the first one they lay off. So with you in your own personal life, the smartest thing to do is to downsize. Don't let nobody talk about you, let them say whatever the hell they wanna say. Hell, they gonna throw dirt on you in life? When you die, they gonna put dirt over the casket. Let it be what it's gonna be. Pack up, move. You gonna be all right. You will get another house. This is not your end, this is your beginning. Sometimes you gotta take four or five steps back to take 1 0 steps in the future. And l'm done. Turn the lights off. Turn the lights off. Jason. Jason, was l... Was l really that bad? l don't understand why you just couldn't tell me. -You don't trust me enough to tell me? -Jason, it wasn't that, all right? lt wasn't. lt was just that l was young. l was confused and l was ashamed. -l didn't even know how to begin to tell you. -Baby, stop. Stop. Listen to me. l am your husband. l love you. Baby, l can see you through anything. But you just push me away. l'm doing all l can. But you have to help me understand, Kimberly. We can't go on like this. Why is it so hard To get over your past l'm doing all l can to help you. Why am I still hurting? Why does this anger last? l'm getting tired, baby. Something's gotta change. You know what? l'm finished. l'm out of here. Wait. No, Jason. Wait, please.

Baby, l love you. l love you so much. So anyway, your grandma did not want your mama around me at all. She said, ''Stay away from her. She gonna have you in Hell.'' She snuck out of the house and came with me and l took her to Hell. -Madea. Madea. -What? -What? -What do you mean you took her to Hell? l took her to my job. l was working at a place called Hell. -lt was a strip club. -Yeah. Ain't no shame in my game. l was shaking that thing. Anyway, she come up in there, and my friend Ronald, he was back there in the kitchen. He was flipping burgers. And he said, ''Come over her.'' So, she sat down, and then they said, ''They're calling you up.'' That was me. They say, ''Ladies and gentlemen, Two All-Beef Patties.'' That was my stage name. So l go up there on the stage, and they didn't tell me that they had changed the poles. See, back in my day, they had telephone poles. Yeah. But then they changed it to these little goal posts and didn't tell me. So l go up there and l grab them jokers, l say, ''What the hell is this?'' Two All-Beef Patties, l grabbed them jokers and l was holding on to them, -and they both bent just like this. -Oh, my. Ronald got mad at me 'cause he had just put them poles up. So, he asked me to leave. So, me and your mama left. l felt bad. l was embarrassed, you know. Anyway, Ronald called me up a few years later, he say, ''Listen, l'm so sorry l was so mean to you and your friend. ''Y'all come on down to my place 'cause l've opened up a new place.'' l go up in there and l'm looking all over for him. l can't find him nowhere. l say, ''Where's Ronald at?'' They say, ''He over there.'' l walk over to him, l say, ''What's wrong with you? ''Why are you sitting here dressed like a clown?'' He say, ''You just inspire so much from me, l just want you to see. ''When l saw them things bent, what l came up with.'' -What? -He said, ''Look out there on that pole.'' And there it was, the Golden Arches, up in the air. -Wait. That was you? -Yes. Yes, l inspired Ronald McDonald to start McDonald's. That's right. That's right. Two All-Beef Patties. Yeah. So anyway... -l just wanna thank... -So, your mama was there. We was eating our... l just wanna thank you. Yeah. Thank you for that. l love McDonald's. Thank you, again. And they love you, too. Over a billion served. Look here. So, what l was saying was... So after that, we was eating our fries, and he started playing music. And your mama had never heard this music. She kept asking me, ''Who is that?'' l said, ''That's Chaka Khan.'' Next song comes on. ''Who was that?'' l say, ''That's Gladys Knight.'' She didn't know none of them people. Your mama had been to church so much, she had never heard of Maze featuring Frankie Beverly. -Oh, no. -Wow. And Maze has not done an album since 1 847. But they would come in here and sell this place out right now, 'cause them boys are some singers there. We had this music back then. See, they had lyrics. Man, you had to go through something to write those songs back in the day. l feel sorry for these children, 'cause they don't know nothing. They ain't going through nothing. You had to go through something to write, ''Last night, me and my woman cried together.'' You had to go through that. This is how they do it now. This is how they write music. l know, 'cause l've seen them. The producers say, ''Dawg child, ''let me sing you a beat.'' He sings the beat. The beat's like... Then they say ''write something'' to them. ''Write something.'' -Yeah. -And then them little boys, they do it. I want your booty That big ol' booty Throw that booty, flip that booty Let me see that booty See, it's a hit. lt's a hit. Look, look. See, that's stupid stuff. But back in the day you had to go through something. Like Gladys Knight said, ''Neither one of us wants to be the first to say it. ''lt's sad to think we're not gonna make it.'' See, that was music. Aretha Franklin said, ''l'd stage a ballet on the table top. Oh, me. Oh, my.'' l sure want to know how Aretha got up on that table top. l wanna see that. l wanna see that. Some strong ones. Teena Marie and Rick James talking about fire and desire. See, that was music. While Stevie Wonder say, ''lsn't she lovely?'' l don't know how he knew that, but he sure said it. -That was music. -Yeah. Well, look here, dear. Back in the day my favorite girl was Betty Wright. What... What band is that? Betty said... Tonight is the night That you make me a woman You said you'd be gentle with me And I, I hope you will I'm nervous and I'm trembling Waiting for you to walk in I'm trying hard to relax But I just can't keep still Bam. Bam. Bam. Bam. Bam. Bam. Come back, Bam. Come back. 'Cause you just went back to your very first time. Very first time. -And we eased it right on by. Yes, we did. -And we eased it right on by. Yes, we did. That was my favorite. But l used to like them songs that'd break out in unison and harmony. Just start up. They'd say something like this. Y'all ain't ready. Y'all ain't ready. Y'all ain't ready. You want my love and you can't deny Sing it, Dea. You know it's true, but you try to hide You turn down love like it's really bad Take your time. You can't give what you never had Well, bless your soul, you can fool a few I know the truth, and so do you Yeah, yeah, yeah Sing it, Atlanta. Sing it. You can't hide l knew you knew it. l knew it. And I betcha -Betcha -Betcha Can't hide Iove Can't hide Iove -Girl, l betcha -Girl, l betcha Can't hide Feelings inside Hey, hey, hey Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Bring it down. Two all-beef patties -SpeciaI sauce, Iettuce, cheese -Two all-beef patties Look here. Look here. Look here. Look here. That music was so good back in the day, you didn't even know what to do. The words was so sweet. And when they ran out of words, all they said was ''shoop.'' Shoop, shoop Wait. Let me hear them. Let me hear them. Shoop, shoop Let me hear it again. Shoop, shoop, shoop Now l'm gonna take the high part. There it is. You know what l was talking about. That music was so good back in the day, it'd give you courage to leave a good situation or bad situation. Then you'd get out there late at night, you done walked out on your love, thinking the grass was greener on the other side. But then you got over there and realized the water bill is high as hell, so you wanted to go back. Find yourself round about midnight nice and lonely. Bobby Womack done wore you out talking about, ''lf you think you're lonely now, wait till tonight.'' So you decide to call old faithful. Everybody got a old faithful that they call when they're in need. Don't act like you ain't got no old faithful. lf you're with your husband or your wife, you better be looking straight ahead. You better not be smiling or nothing. l can see some people with an old faithful, right there, right there. Let me tell you something about old faithful. Old faithful is usually ugly as hell. Ain't nothing wrong with ugly people. Come on, clap for ugly people, clap for ugly people. Yes, come on! l see some of you are clapping for yourself. That's beautiful. You can't help it. You can't help it if you're ugly and fat. You can't help it if you ugly. But if you ever find yourself about to make love to somebody that's ugly, and you don't know what to do, there was a song written back in the day for making love to ugly people. 'Cause there was a song writer who found himself in this very situation. He didn't know what to do with this ugly woman, so he wrote a beautiful song. So if you ever find yourself about to make love to somebody ugly and you don't know what to do, this song was written just for that occasion. Turn off the lights And light a candle Tonight I'm in a romantic mood, yeah Teddy was telling all of his business in this song, 'cause he had hooked up with a ugly woman, and not only was she ugly, but she wasn't too fresh. And the reason l know she wasn't fresh 'cause of the next line, this is what he said. Let's take a shower Shower together I'll wash your body and you'll wash mine, yeah See, Teddy was a player. That's a slick move. Ladies, anytime a man says, ''l'll wash your body, you wash mine,'' that mean he don't trust you to wash your own body. And then her skin was hard and crusty, 'cause this is what he said next. Listen. Rub me down in some hot oils, baby And I'll do the same thing for you Turn 'em off! All right. You out there doing all that clapping. There's Monroe, you better watch your purse. Turn the lights on, Monroe, turn the lights on. Yes, ma'am, Madea. I'm lying here Waiting, my dear You can get what you want Anytime you want it GirI, I wanna give you a treat 'cause you look so sweet Like a big, old piece of chocolate meat Yeah Yes Yah, trick Yeah Yes Yah, trick -l got a song, Dea. -You got one? -Yeah. -Let's hear it. If loving you is wrong I don't wanna be right You wrong for that. 'Cause if being right means being without you I'd rather live a wrong-doing life My mama and daddy say it's a shame It's a downright disgrace But as long as I got you by my side I don't care what your people say My friends tell me it's no future In loving a married man If I can't see you when I want I'll see you when I can If loving you is wrong I don't wanna be right Hey, baby If loving you is wrong I don't wanna be right I don't want to be right If it means being without you, baby I don't wanna be right And I don't want my heart to be No, no Almost, almost, almost. These songs, what people going through, you can tell what they going through, 'cause they sing this song at the top of their lung. Everybody sing. If loving you is wrong I don't wanna be right l knew it. Since you've been away, boy I ain't got no plans No, no, no, no And the sound of the rain Look at her. Against my window pane He done put you through it, didn't he? Come on, y'all. Come on. I'm going down Since you ain't around, baby My whole world's upside down SIeep don't come easy Boy, please believe me Since you've been gone Everything's going wrong Why'd you have to say goodbye?

That bass was something. Listen to it. Stop. l'm about to get pregnant. l got a song l wanna do. -You got one? -Yeah. l don't wanna hear that. Come on back. l don't wanna hear that hip-hop. Come on back here. No, Madea, this is a song my mother used to play all the time. -lt's an old song? -Yeah. -lt's older than you? -Yeah. -Okay, let's hear it. -Go ahead, baby. No. No. Come on. Come on. Don't do that to yourself. That's Lenny Williams. Lenny sung the hell out of that song. Don't do that to yourself, son. Lenny put that song up so high, can't nobody do that song. Don't do that to yourself. lf you miss a note, you're going to turn into a pillar of salt. Let him do it, Madea, let him do it. You letting them psych you up, man. You letting them... That's fine. They wanna hear it, go on, do it. Go on, do it. -Do it, brother. -All right. Rock it! Rock it! And then l want you to pause it and pop it. GirI, you know I Iove you No matter what you do And I hope you understand me Every word I say is true Because I love you I'm thinking of you Trying to be more of a man for you, baby And I don't have much riches But we gonna see it through Because I love you Some men need Iots of women For their passions to feel But I want only you, girl If it's in If it's in God's wiII 'Cause I Love you I love you, baby With all my heart and soul I'm glad I found you Oh, I just Iove to be around you Listen, I love you I love you Come on back, take a bow, boy. Take a bow. Take a bow. You sung the hell out of that song. -Break it down to you, baby. -Hold on, hold on. Hold on. Break it down. You know, maybe you've never been in love like l've been in love. That's what Lenny said. That's what Lenny said. l can't hit that high note, but l can do that. l can do that part. Look, l'm getting ready to go, but l gotta tell y'all something. This life is short. Enjoy yourself, do you hear me? Your mama would be so happy looking at all of y'all smiling and happy. Love somebody. You get one family. Do the best you can with it. Do you hear me?

Thank you. Did you enjoy yourself? Mr. Brauner, how are you doing? Sit down, sit down. Sit down. l want to tell you we recorded this show today for DVD. So, you guys are going all over the world. So, thank you so much for being such a great audience. l am... l wrote this show in late December, after my mother died. She died December 8th, 2009. And it's been a rough, rough, rough six-eight months for me, but what l know is that God doesn't make any mistakes. And when l wrote it, what l wanted people to walk away with is, if there's somebody that you love that you haven't spoken to, or you're angry about something, people will slip away from here, and you'll not even know the day nor the hour. So, take some time and fix it. Take some time to tell somebody you love them, especially your mother, your father, tell them that you love them. Most of the time, what l know, is that they do their best. They do their best, they did their best. They may have made decisions that you don't agree with, but take some time and fix it, okay? lf this is you. And if it ain't you, then God bless you, you got some peace in your life. So, l kind of worked myself silly, 'cause we did 1 20... Not only did l work myself silly, but l worked them to death. We did... He said, ''Yeah, you did.'' We did 1 25 shows in 1 26 days. l finished that and immediately started shooting For Colored Girls, which is an amazing... How many of y'all know about For Colored Girls? Let me tell you something, l got new respect for it, because, you know, you see the play, you read it, and you go, ''Oh, okay, it's some poems.'' But when you have Phylicia Rashad, Kerry Washington, Anika Noni Rose, Kimberly Elise, Thandie Newton, Macy Gray, Tessa Thompson, Whoopi Goldberg, and Janet Jackson saying those words, it is powerful. And l cannot wait. lt comes out in December-January. So, l cannot wait for you guys to see it. Go to the movie and see it. Don't take your children, though. Because if you know the poems, you know there's babies falling out of windows and... l got so drained doing it, l said, ''l gotta go do a Madea movie, '''cause this thing is...'' Look, my mama told me, ''Don't stop doing Madea,'' so as long as you wanna see it, l'll keep doing it. l'll tell you that's the honest truth. l live in positivity. l live in it. l love it. l have it all around me. ''So as a man thinketh, so is he.'' And if you plant it all around you, it's got to come back to you. That is a universal law. lt is in the Bible. l promise you, if you plant good things... People say, ''How'd you get so blessed? How'd you have so much favor?'' l give favor. l plant favor. l'll walk up to people and just do nice things for them, randomly. Do things that people don't even know that l'm doing, because l want God to continue to do that for me. And l promise you, what l found is that if you are struggling and you want to be blessed, help somebody else who's struggling. 'Cause there's always, there's always somebody who's doing a little worse than you are. So, l just want you to know that. l just want you to know how much l appreciate you, how much l respect you, how much l love you, and how much l thank you for coming tonight. l want to thank my cast and my crew. This woman right here has been with me since my very first play. Miss Chandra Currelley. Very first show. And she has stayed with me as long as she got her check. When we started early on, this man had told me... Y'all ready to go home? l can let you go. This promoter had told me, he said, ''l'm gonna take you out on the road. ''l'm gonna take you on the road.'' l said, ''Come on, let's go.'' And l was working, making a little money, and l had booked this place, and we were rehearsing, and Chandra was showing up for rehearsal every day, she said, ''You got the tour yet? The tour schedule?'' l said, ''No, l don't have it yet, but he said he's gonna send it.'' ''Okay.'' Next day she came, she said, ''You got the tour schedule yet?'' l said, ''No.'' ''Did he send you a deposit?'' l said, ''No, he ain't sent me no deposit.'' ''Okay, well, l'm going home. You call me when you get your deposit.'' But l kept my dream alive. No matter how many people lied to me, no matter how many people told me l couldn't do it, l kept the dream alive. And there are some dreams in this room, and l want you to know something, people don't like the economy and things going on, this is the time for you to step out on faith. l promise you... There's a transferring of things that is happening in this time, and you will miss it, it'll slip right out from under you. All of the dreamers in this room, you've got a dream that you have let go, you have let die, you need to go back, dust it off, and wake it up. You're never too old. lt can come to pass, l promise you. You're looking at a man who is full of miracles. l have seen nothing but miracles in my life. And let me tell you this, God will do something for you. Everybody that you go to to ask for help, ''lf l can get to this person, they'll help me.'' You think that that person is the one who's going to help you. God will close all of those doors. Everybody l asked for help, who could've helped me, didn't. And l was confused, l was angry, l said, ''God, why is everybody... ''They got this, and they got this, and they can't help me.'' God said, ''l'm gonna do this for you in a way that you know it was me.'' So, if doors are closing, don't worry about it. lf they ain't working out, don't worry about it. lt's God sending you in the direction that you are supposed to go, and he put me in a place where l can not only write shows and movies and do all that stuff, but l can also hire hundreds and thousands of people. So, that is a blessing. lt truly is. People in Hollywood that don't work, couldn't work, couldn't get hired, and now she got her own show. This man right here, who is the funniest man l've ever worked with, and he needs his own show. l'm working on it. All of these singers on this stage... And there are people on this stage, man, been in jail, strung out... You're laughing, but God has brought him to this place. Mr. Danny Clay, y'all. Mr. Danny Clay. So, l'm gonna let you go. But l want you to know, keep your dreams alive. No matter how hard it gets, no matter how many people talk about you. They're gonna throw dirt on you, that's all right, when they put you in that box, they're gonna throw dirt on you some more, so it's okay. Go. Don't be afraid. Have no fear. God will see it through for you, okay? God bless you, Atlanta. l love you so much. Thank you so much. Y'all take care. Tyler, l wanna say that you are most encouraging and inspiring. l had a good time. Tyler threw down. He outdid himself this time. Love you, Tyler Perry. Chill Will coming out of Rochester, New York, wanna give a big shout out to Tyler Perry for doing his thing. lt was absolutely amazing. l love Tyler Perry. l love you, and l'll see you again, and again, and again. Hi, Tyler, thanks for coming to Buffalo, New York. -We have all your DVDs. -We go see all your movies. Store bought. Not bootlegged. Thank you so much for all you do, and you are so positive, and for the youth of today, l know that you're gonna pave the way. But most of all, we thank him for how he just keeps it so real, and most of all, l personally thank Madea for remembering God in all that he do. God bless you. We love you, Tyler! He's doing sell-out crowds. Good to have him in Mobile. We loveTyler Perry's Big Happy Family. We really enjoyed the show. We had a wonderful evening. -Thanks, Tyler, for coming to Buffalo. -Thank you. Thanks, Tyler. We love you. l'm loving it. The music is very inspirational. l just want to say to my brother, Tyler Perry, l think that he's a excellent example and role model for the African-American man. The show was hilarious. Must see. l mean, there ain't no words for it. lt's just completely funny. l think he's wonderful. He is so inspiring, and he gives us hope, and l love the way he talked to children. -Thank you, Tyler Perry! -Hey, to Tyler from Philly! -Philly representing. We love Tyler Perry. -We love Tyler Perry. And Tyler Perry play was my first play that l've ever seen in my life. And l'm just excited to be here today. You are an amazing inspiration to me. l took your struggles and matched them with mine, and l definitely took this artistic outlet that l have as a writer and was making my dreams come true. lt's always a pleasure to see a Tyler Perry play, mainly because he brings so much to the table. He touches so many different situations, home, family, and he's just a great person in general. And we thank God for him. Tyler, keep it going.
