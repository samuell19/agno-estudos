That was Bobby Lewis with "Tossin' and Turnin'" hitting number one for the second week in a row. And now here's a little something for the Bronx Bombers. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Crosley Field for game three of the 1961 World Series between the American League champions, the New York Yankees, and the National League champions, YOURRR Cincinnati Reds! Cincinnati, the very cradle of professional baseball since 1868 and has been a baseball hotbed ever since. And no fans anywhere are more enthusiastic than these now converging on Crosley Field. They're announcing the teams. Mickey Mantle, wearing number 7, suffering from a hip wound, will make his first appearance in this series. It's Mick. A courageous performer. Batting in fourth place and playing right field, wearing number 9, It's Maris. Announcer: the holder of the single season home run record, Roger Maris. And there go the Reds, and the fight for the series lead is on. I'm afraid the fever has left young William deaf. Doc, there has to be something you can do. I'm sorry. It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. Why, Rebecca, it's mighty good to see you. Thank you, Mabel. Ruth, it's nice to see you as well. We have to get together soon. I look forward to that. You best stop makin' fun of my brother. Whatcha gonna do? You keep it up and you'll see. Boys! William! Boys! Knock it off right now. What are you doin'? They started it, Pa. I don't care who started it. You know fighting is never the answer. But Pa! There's no "But Pa." You know what, everybody get in the wagon right now. Let's go. - Rebecca, dear, may - I suggest you leave the young deaf and dumb boy on the farm. Excuse me? Well, it's just that... No, Mabel, you don't need to explain. We... we don't need a circus in town. You boys be careful with your brother. Ah, Ma, Will can hold his own. You saw him. You hold your tongue, boy. Yes, ma'am. C'mon, guys, leave him alone. Will, no. You cannot do that. Do you understand? You boys should grow up. What do you know about growin' up? I heard you, Frank. That's no way to talk to your sister. She started it. C'mon, let's go do something. All right. All right. Go ahead. Go have fun, but stay out of trouble, all right? - Yes, sir. - All right? They're boys, Ma. My goodness. I know, but I worry so about Will. You gotta let him be a boy. You can't keep him on the farm forever, honey. Come on. Well, what are we gonna do? We take him into town and everybody laughs at him. Ah. They laugh at all of us. You don't mind those people. That's just them being ignorant. What about them fighting with the other boys? You know, I'll sit 'em down, I'll remind 'em that fighting is never the answer. Okay? Come on. Well, what about his schooling? You know, how is he ever going to get an education if the school doesn't even want him to attend? Well, why don't we go check out that school in Columbus that the doc told us about? He'll be with... he'll be with other kids just like him. But it's so far. Well, we'll go look at it. What do you say? Come on, now. You're such a blessing, you know that? Ooh, my goodness, yes, you are. Good job. Get back to work. You're up to bat. Come on, let's go! What? What is it? Stop. Everyone, come in here. I'd like to play baseball. You want to play baseball? Yes. You're too small. And too skinny. I want to play. Okay. Let's see what you got. You bat first. Nope. Move back. There. Put your hands closer together and spread your feet apart. Back a little more. You have to swing at the ball. Three strikes, you're out, kid. Let's see if you can catch a ball. Take the field. Yes, right there. He is going to hit the ball to you. You'll never make it. Good job. Be careful. It's time to come in. Give it to me. I've been watching you. You've been watching me? Yes. For months. Why? You want to play baseball, right? That's right. You can't. You're too small. You already told me that. You're going to get a lot of that. People will tease you. You need to be better than everyone. It doesn't matter if you are small or deaf. The great thing about us being deaf is that we don't have to hear what they say. You can stay completely focused. Let me show you how I practice throwing strikes. When you can hit that square consistently, that's when you know you're good. Watch. Better than anyone. Understand? I think you're ready. The team is going to be barnstorming across Ohio and the Midwest. We need one more player. What do you say? h We're called the Ohio Independents. Come on, run! Let's go! Let's go! Run! Safe! Good game. I taught you well. We just beat a very good team. You deaf boys play pretty good. White boys usually don't normally shake our hands. Hearing boys usually don't tell us we play pretty good, so I guess that makes us equal. Yes, I guess it does. 1 John 4:7,8 tells us, "Beloved, let us love one another. For love is of God, and everyone that loveth is born of God." Life is about discovering the love that God has for you. It is about responding to his love. It's about loving him in return. And it is about loving people. It's as simple as that. Receive God's love. Enjoy God's love. Love God. Love people. The rest is in the details. Reasons to come in contact with people, every day, so that we may love them. And every day is an opportunity to love God and love people, whether they love us back or not. If they love you, love them. If they do not love you, love them. Isn't that the deaf and dumb boy? I had heard he came back. If they are good to you, love them. I heard no one wanted him. If they are bad to you, love them. If they hurt you, love them. If they persecute you, love them. If they kill you, love them. Beloved, let us love one another. Amen. What a friend we have in Jesus... Lord, we thank you for this food that we're about to receive. And also thank you for William graduating school, and for all the blessings you bestowed on the Hoy family. - Everybody, say amen. - Amen. Let's eat. I talked to Mr. Beagle today and he was looking for a helping hand. Well, fall's coming. I'm sure he'll be busy. Yep. John, sit up straight. Yeah, he wanted to ask if we didn't mind if William can work for him since he learned shoemaking in school. What did you tell him? Well, I told him I'd talk to you first. Well, I don't think it's a Untitled Why not? He's not ready to go out in the hearing world by himself. Becca. When would he like him to start? In a couple of months, before fall, so he can become familiar with the shop. Jacob, you know what will happen. It's the same thing over and over again. I do not want my son to be humiliated. We're not always gonna be there to protect him. I know. I just don't think it's a good idea. Okay. It's gonna be okay. I'm takin' the boys into town tomorrow to pick up some supplies. It's a great opportunity to tell Mr. Beagle that William can start as soon as he needs him. William can stay here with Ora and myself. Some of the town boys are playing baseball and I thought William would enjoy watching since he played a little in school. What's he saying? He thought maybe he could play baseball. No, it's not the kinda game I want you playing. I want you focused on work. Come on, gittup here. Come on. Good boy. There 'ya are Whoa. That's it. Good boy. Whoa. How are you, Dave? Hey, Jacob! Good to see 'ya. - Good to see 'ya. Yeah. - Good to see 'ya. William, say hello. Hey, I'm glad he brought you along, William. So Rebecca and I talked it over and he can start whenever you'd like. Well, that's great. That's just great. I really appreciate you bringing him in for work. Now, when you want to talk to him, you gotta look at him square in the eye so he can read your lips. Oh, I'm not gonna have any problem with that. I've been having a little trouble with my own hearing. And look at these hands. They've done a lot of work. But you've got nothing to worry about. It's gonna work out well. Thank you. What are you boys all doin' here? Well, I promised 'em I'd take 'em over to watch the baseball game. That's a good thing. I'll see you after. All right? All right. Have a good time, boys. Thanks again, Dave. Pleasure to see you, Jacob. Let's go. Keep it going, boys! Yeah! Come on! All right. Keep it going, boys! Keep it going, boys! Whoa! So you really wanna play some baseball? Son, you gotta build a future. Playing baseball is no life you can hang your hat on. You understand? What? Let me see. I know you played a little in school. You were good, huh? You even beat some big-time leaguers? Son, baseball's for hoodlums. Maybe one day you can play for fun, but it's not gonna get you anywhere. Besides, you got a job now. Come on. I just don't understand. I don't ...I just don't get why nobody's coming in. Well, howdy, boys. How you doin'? Doin' great, Dave. Yourself? Oh, I'm doin' just fine. Is there anything I can do for you? Well, we got some shoes here that need fixin'. Oh, it doesn't... let me... let me see these here. What you got? You got a... yeah. See you got that dumb boy over there working for you. Oh, he's a good cobbler. Yeah? Well, if it's all the same to you, we'd just as soon that you do the work on our shoes. I've been working for years. My hands are all givin' away from it. That boy over there, he's a... he's a fine worker with shoes. I just don't see how no dumb boy can be fixin' no shoes. Dave, let me give you a little advice. Nobody in this town wants their shoes fixed up by no dumb boy. Let me give you a piece of advice. You two boys and this whole town can ride a hundred miles to another town and get your shoes fixed or you can let my boy fix 'em, because one way or another, I don't give a damn. You might wanna rethink that, Dave. Or close down. Yeah. Well, I wouldn't even give that a thought. Good to see you. Hey, what's wrong, son? You okay? Oh. Am I ashamed of you? Oh, no. What made you think a thing like that? You read their lips and they said they don't want you in town? Listen to me. To hell with them. Just to hell with them. You just keep doin' you a fine job and they'll come back. You believe me, I know. And you can start with that pair of boots. Give me that here. Just to hell with 'em. You do your work, they'll come. That's a fine piece of work. Oh, hello, Miss. Can I help you? I'd like to know, sir, how much it would cost to get these shoes fixed up. I'll take a look at 'em. Oh, Miss, I'm afraid these... these shoes are beyond repair. Would you like to buy another pair? No, I... I can't. All right. Well, I thank you for coming in and I wish you good day. - Thank you. - Thank you. Damn, would ya look at these? I'd swear these here are new shoes. Did you do this work, boy? Ain't no damn way. Well, iffin' he did, he's the best. Except for you, Dave. Yeah, you're the best. I know that, boys. He's a fine cobbler. Well, we'll be gettin' on now. See you, Dave. Yeah, see 'ya, Dave. We'll tell everybody he's real good. Thanks, Dummy. Hey! His name is William. Oh, well, we should have these ready in about... oh, about a week, boys. Here you go. There you go. Oh, Ruth, there. Mabel. Let me see what you got here. Oh, dear. Why did you wait so long before you brought your shoes in to be fixed? Well... well, we we didn't. It's just that... We didn't have the time. That's it. That's what it was. Oh, well, that's all right. We're gonna fix these shoes so they look brand-new, huh? TWill they be as good as the Waller boys' shoes? Even better. Thank you, Mr. Beagle. Yes, thank you. Take care. How would you like to buy the shop? Yeah. Yeah. Well, you know, I'm gettin' up in years, and, well, my hands, you know, they're just... they're no good anymore, and this town needs a good cobbler, and I can't think of anybody better than you. Huh? What? Oh, yeah, you gotta talk to your dad. You talk to your dad and you let me know what he says. All right? Now let's get back and do this work. Oh, look, there's that dummy. - Ow, Ma! - Ow! Daddy, come on. This way. Preacher, great sermon. Thank you. Who's that? Well, I know it's a girl. She came in the shop the other day needing some shoes. Well, she's pretty. Do you like her a little bit? Huh? Easy, boys. Come on, now. She is pretty, though. Hey, how's... how's Mr. Beagle treating you? Real fine, Pop. It's pretty busy now. Mister... Mr. Beagle wants to sell you the shop? That's great news, son. That is great. That's wonderful. Wow. I'm proud of you. Wait. You've earned it. It's good. You've earned it. You keep it up. Okay? I'm proud of you. Uh-huh. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Sir, I can't pay for these. I got no money. Didn't you hear what I said? I got no money. For me? Thanks, sir. Oh! Look, guys, look! Look what the new cobbler gave me! Woah! You're a good man, William. A very fine man. Hi. I know you can't hear me, but I wanted to say thank you for giving my brother shoes. I'd like to pay you for them. I know it's not much, but it's all I have. My pa, he doesn't work much. I'm sorry. Oh. You're very kind. Thank you. Hi, William Hoy. I'm Sarah Evans. Yes, I'm fine, thank you. Are you waiting for someone? Yes, I am waiting for someone. No, I'm waiting for you. You. Do you want to walk? I want you to teach me how to talk with my hands. You want to learn sign? You want to learn how to sign? Yes. Yes, I want to learn. Excuse me. Excuse me. I need my shoes fixed. Hey, buddy, you gonna answer me? Hey! Hey! Okay, then. I'll go someplace else. Finally I get your attention. You can't hear? Well, why don't you rig you up somethin' to this door, a pulley system, so when you open the door... ... it falls. Look, here's the door. You get a pulley, take a line, and you rig it, you tie it to this hammer. When the door opens, the hammer falls and you feel it. You're welcome. I need new soles. I'll fix them for free. Oh, no, no, no, no. You work really hard. I'll pay you. I'll pay you. I want to pay you back for your idea. Just do a really good job on them. That'll be payment enough. That's good. Good. Thank you very much. Throw it! Throw it! He's out. He's out! You see that throw? That's no fair. He can't do that. He ain't even playin'. Why you got that hammer hittin' the floor? Come here. Put your hands on the floor. The floor vibrates. What does it say? Si-si-since I cannot h-h-hear, I f-f- feel the... the vibr-bration. He feels the vibration. That's what it says. Why can't you hear? He can't hear you, stupid. Don't call me stupid. He just told you he can't hear, so why did you ask the question? - Then write it. - You write it. Why? 'Cause you can't write, stupid? - Can you? - Yeah. Okay. Then go ahead, write it. Why don't you-all write it? Well, you asked the question. Yeah, you asked the question. Calm down. Would you like to play baseball with us? Baseball. Would you like to play with us? If you learn to read and write, we can play baseball. Let me have it. Let's play. Gene was the kindest little soul in the world, but this hint about... I want to see you. You... you want to start a team with us? Wow! Ya mean it? How do you always know where the ball is going? Wow! Excuse me, boys. What's the name of your team? Stonewall Jackson Ball Club. That's a great name. Play here every day? That's right, Mister. That's our playing field. Yeah, we got us a big game tomorrow over at the park. Yeah, it's gonna be big. The whole darn town's gonna come out and watch us. That's great. Tell me somethin', that guy with the shirt and the tie, who's he? He's the cobbler. He play pretty good, don't he? Yes, he does. Okay. Yeah, we won't tell Pa we're playing ball. Thank you, boys. Good luck tomorrow. - Thanks, Mister. - You bet. Young man, can I have a moment? Excuse me. Young man. Excuse me. Excuse me. Young man. Hey, Mister, you know he can't hear 'ya, don't 'ya? Who? The cobbler, Dummy Hoy. Why do you call him that? Because he's deaf and dumb. You're talkin' about the young man that just walked into that shoe store? Yes, sir. That's exactly who I'm talking about. Can't hear anything? Poor boy can't hear or speak a lick. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Ball. Ball. B-A-L-L. What's with you and that deaf and dumb boy? Nothing, Daddy. He's just a nice boy. Yeah. Well, you two seem to be gettin' real close. Daddy, I like him. He's not normal. I don't want you gettin' to like him too much. Now, what's all this hand stuff? That's the way he talks. It makes the two of you look like monkeys. Stay away from him. Daddy! Did you hear what I said?! He gave Jimmy a pair of shoes whenever he needed them. If I hada known he needed them, I would have got Jimmy some shoes. Well, if you'd quit drinking, you would have known. Woman, talk some sense into this girl. Never mind. I know what you're gonna say, Mama. Gittup here. Gittup here. Whoa, boy. Good boy. Let's go on. - Is that William and the boys? - I believe it is. Frank! - Hey, Pa. - Frank, come here. - What are you boys doin'? - Nothing, Pa. Don't you "Nothing, Pa" me. I saw you playing ball. William, I told you I didn't want you playin' baseball, correct? Pa, William's real good at playing baseball. Yeah, I don't want to hear nothin' of it. You got a business to run right now. Boys, get in the wagon. William, I want you back at the shoe store. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to... You played pretty good. You should be out there with the rest of the boys having fun. You can't hear me, can you? I watched you play ball. You're a natural. Now, do you think you can play that well against pro players? My name is Dooley. I'm a baseball scout. I would like you to go to Urbana with me and play for Kenton. Can you go? Why? It doesn't look like there's a lot of business. I'll tell you what, if you want to go, be at the train station next Saturday. I'll buy your ticket. Play that one more time. You sold that. Okay. Where is it now? Uh-huh. One more time. One more time. Oh, hold on. Let's see. This man saw me play today and wants me to play on the Kenton team. A man wants you to play baseball for Kenton? Who is this man? His name is Dooley, a baseball scout. Ora, give papa a kiss. Go sit down, please. Thank you, Honey. William, we already talked about baseball. You have a business now. Okay? It'll be for just one day. Besides, no one is coming into the shop right now. That's a bunch of hogwash. Baseball is not a game for you. I'm good at it, Pa. I said no. You said I could play. I said maybe. He's real good, Pa. Anybody else? Listen to me, family, I don't think this is a good idea. He has a business now. I'm sorry, son. Becca, that was a great dinner, honey. Dummy, we heard about the scout. Kenton and Urbana are big rivals. What? This is your big chance. I think you should follow your dream. My father would be very angry. Wouldn't he want you to be happy? He wants me to have a future. He's right. I know you want to honor your father, but think about it. You are very good. Read it! All aboard! All aboard! Do you always wear a shirt and tie? Get on the train. See that pitcher over there? That's Billy Hart. Think you can hit off of him? Oh, yeah. Don't let on that you're deaf. Trust me. Woah! Hey, Scout. Hello, boys. How ya doin', Scout? Good. Yourself, Billy? Feeling good. Ready to beat your boys. Who 'ya got here? Oh, it's a new guy I'm looking at. Wanna see him play. Your guys could use all the help they can get. But he looks a little small to be playing ball, ain't he? That's what I like about you, Billy, you're so modest. We'll see 'ya out there, kid. Come on, kid. Let's see what you got. Dummy's gone to Urbana. You won't get your shoes. Oh, Mr. Hoy. I didn't... I didn't know it was you, sir. It's okay. - Thank you. - Yes, sir. Hey, we got a lefty here. Son of a gun. Great game. Oh, yeah, it is. Hello. Hi. Are you deaf? You got me. You play baseball very well. Thank you. Are you from Urbana? No, Cincinnati. You came all this way to watch me play? I don't even know you, sir. Allow me to change that. I am William Hoy. And you are? Anna Marie Lowery. This is my brother, Frank, the reason I came here. He also wants to play this game baseball. I'm sure someday he will. And who is this? This is Mrs. McCall. She escorted me here from the Cincinnati Oral School. Are you a resident? I teach children how to use their voice. I assume you use your voice to play baseball? No, ma'am; I do not. I have never learned how to. Well, Mr. Hoy, I think you should consider it. I will. It was a pleasure to meet you, Miss Lowery. Maybe someday we will meet again. Perhaps we will, Mr. Hoy. Good day. Good day. And a pleasure to meet you, Mrs. McCall, Frank. A pleasure, sir. What the hell. What the hell! Hey, Scout, who is that guy? Oh, that's my friend, Dummy Hoy. Dummy Hoy? Yeah, deaf and dumb kid outta Houcktown. What are you talkin' about? You tellin' me this guy can't hear nothing? That's right. Not a lick. No way. Ain't no way no dummy's gonna beat me. He just did, Billy boy. He just did. I'm takin' you to Milwaukee. Come on. Come on. Gittup there. Gittup there. Gittup there. Come on. Gittup there. Gittup there. Gittup there. Gittup there. Gittup there. Whoa, boy. Whoa, whoa. Whoa! Whoa! Gittup there. Gittup there. Come on. Come on. Gittup there. Get out of there! Come on! What is this? What? Ask him what this is. What is that? It's why I want to play baseball. It's why I want to play baseball. What does it say? It says, "Stay away from Sarah, freak." He wants me to tell you that he never meant to go against your wishes. I just wanted to prove to everyone that I could do what other boys could do. I know people look at me like I'm some monkey behind the counter fixing their shoes, but just because I can't hear doesn't mean I don't feel. Pa, look at me! I'm small and I'm deaf, and nobody takes me serious until I show them what I can do. I know why... I know why you and Ma don't want me to play baseball. You think that I'm going to get hurt because I'm deaf. I need you... to prove to you that I'm good at baseball. Dooley wants to send me to Milwaukee. I know you and Ma want to protect me, but I don't want to hide behind you while other people laugh at us and call us names. I want you to be proud of me and tell everyone, "There goes my son. Have you seen him play ball?" Oh, that's my boy. You go show 'em, boy. You write. You write to us quick. I will. Driver: Mr. Hoy? Mr. William Hoy? Tell him it's time to go. It's time for you to go. Promise me you'll be back to open the shop for the fall. I promise. Thank you. Sir, your ticket. Sir? Sir? Sir, your ticket. Let's go, Trevor. All right. Get to the ball, Alan! Get to the ball! Play at first! Play at first! Come on! What's going on, guys? Get the ball in. Come on. Don't walk to the ball. Alan, make the play. Go to first. What do ya want? Yeah, I'm the manager. There you go. That's it. That's it. Do it again. So, Dooley sent you for a tryout, huh? What's with the notes, kid? What, don't you hear? I get it. This is some joke, right? Dooley's playin' me for some damn fool. You don't understand? I said this is a joke. A joke. Either you really can't hear or Dooley's fartin' around with me. Tell me this is a joke. Write it. Ah, for Pete's sake, how you gonna play ball if you can't hear? What's that knucklehead thinkin'? Listen, kid, I mean, whatever. You go back and tell Dooley "thanks, but no thanks". I need an outfielder that can hear. You want me to write that down? Okay. Dooley, thanks but no thanks. Send me an outfielder that can hear. Now get outta here! All right. Let's play ball, guys. Come on! What?! Just try me out, that's all I am asking. I told you I can't, kid. You don't hear, and in this game you gotta hear. That's it. Let's go! - Read. - I can't. No. These boys need to depend on each other and you need to hear. Ah, forget it. No. Now, go away. Dooley, what's he thinkin' sending me a freak. Make the play! Make the play, Seth! Come on! Hey, you gotta call for the ball! Nice play, kid! Hey, tell this kid he's gotta call for the ball. I can't. He's deaf. - He's what? - Deaf! What's he doin' here, then? Just let him play. I can't believe this. Ahhh! Play ball! All right. We got us a right fielder. Damn, kid, Dooley's right. I want you. You did a good job out there. All right. Whatcha got? $65 a month? No, no, no. You're just gettin' started. $55 a month. No, no, no, no. Listen, I got guys out there that have been playing with me two years that don't make $65 a month. But I'm good. I can catch the ball and I can hit the ball. You did great. You did great, but they can play too. You work hard, maybe you can make 65, but you're gonna start at 55. Read that. I may be deaf and dumb, but I'm not stupid. Hey, you listen to me, kid! You will never play baseball! Do you hear me?! You will never play for this or any other team! I'll see to it! Do you hear me? Arrr! Of course he doesn't hear me! Damn it! William! Oh, God! Something's wrong! Are you all right? I'm all right. What? What did he say? He's fine. Well, what happened? What happened? They want me to play for them. They want him to play for them. Well, that's great! But I said no. But he said no. He said no? Well, no? Well, why did he say... well, why? Why? This is what you've always wanted. Didn't pay me enough, so I said no. What happened in Milwaukee? You're right. You are better. You're going to Oshkosh. This time, I'm going with you. Get your stuff. Ticket, sir. - Thank you. - Yes, sir. Frank Selee, you old goat, how are 'ya? Dooley, you old skunk, how are you? - Doin' good. Doin' good. - Who's the kid? He's a new player I picked up in Houcktown. I'm tellin' you straight, he's a natural. Yeah? Kind of small, ain't he? Hey! Come on! Come on! Let's see a little hustle out there! Slow as molasses in February. Listen, Frank, this is probably one of the best players I've seen come along in a while. Yeah? What's your name, kid? Yeah, there... did I fail to mention that he is deaf and dumb? You're kidding me. Yeah. Well, no, I'm not. Sorry, kid, I can't use you. All right? All right? Dooley, get me someone that can hear and we'll talk. Come on, Frank. You and I go back a long way. Yeah. Yeah. No, no. Sorry, I can't use him. Why? 'Cause he's deaf and dumb. You know there's a deaf and dumb team, don't you? Frank, what do you have to lose? Just watch him play for a while, and if you don't see that he's that good, we'll walk away. How's he gonna communicate with the other players out there if he's deaf and dumb? Besides, he's too small. Huh? What's he want here? He wants to tell you something. You think that you're... Your boy here thinks he's better than any of my guys. You got a lot of gumption, kid, I'll give you that. You're right, what have I got to lose? Yeah, yeah. No, go on. Go on. Get out there. Thanks, Frank. Yeah. This is gonna be interesting. Yes, it is. Ah, come on, guys! We're gonna have to do better than this. Try hard! Play hard! Train hard! If we wanna be the best, we gotta train and play like the best. All right. Come on! Let's play some ball! Hey! Hey, kid! Kid, move back! Hey, kid, move... Why am I yelling? Dooley, are you pullin' my leg? Just let him play, Frank. Krock! Krock, tell the new kid, tell him to move back! Hey you, move back! What's wrong with this kid? He can't hear. What? He can't hear either. C'mon, coach. This is a joke! Give him a break, Kinz. You're replacin' Joneszy with this guy? I ain't replacing anyone with him yet. Throw that ball in here. I'll teach him not to play shallow. Way to go, kid! - He's fast. Boy's got an arm. The show's just gettin' started, Frank. Hey, he can hit. - This boy's good. - Yes, he is. Hey, Frank, you want to talk to him? Huh? Huh? Oh, yeah. Good? You're great, kid. Yeah, he was right. I want you. I want you on my team. You. $65 a month. Yeah. Well, you got yourself a deal, kid. You got yourself a deal. Yeah, so, be back here in two weeks. Two weeks, we start practice then. Here. What's... what's your name, kid? What's your name? William Hoy. The boys back home call him Dummy Hoy. Dummy Hoy? Okay. Dummy. I like it. Dummy Hoy. Alright. Excuse me. I said excuse me. Can you tell me where I can find the post office? Hello. I am trying to locate someone. Maybe you could help me. Who is this person? Anna Marie Lowery. Oh, yes. I was hoping you would remember me. Of course. How could I forget the great baseball player? How is your brother? Did he ever start playing? Frank was killed in a fight. I am sorry. My father always told me fighting will not solve anything. Yes. So what brings you here into Cincinnati? I just joined a professional baseball team in Oshkosh. That's quite a long ways away. Yes. Yes, it is. Shouldn't you be there? No. I mean yes. I mean I should be there in two weeks. So you have business in Cincinnati? No. It's just that... well, you've been on my mind. This is a beautiful place. Yes, really, this is a very special place for me. I think you should consider learning how to use your voice. What good would it do me? People would look at you differently. The only way they look at me different is when I play baseball well. I feel that would change if you spoke. Half of the players don't even try to talk to me. They're afraid. Of what? Someone with a handicap is better than them. I've never felt that my inability to hear is a handicap. In fact, it is often an asset. Uh-huh. I can feel the tiniest foul tip touching my bat. I know when I hit a ball that it will leave the ballpark or just be a single. And when I'm on base, I have my own secret way of knowing what the batter is going to hit. I know if a runner is going to try to run. And the crowds... Mhm-hmh. Well, I can see the look in their eyes when they like what I've done or even if they don't. I feel their energy when they stand and wave their arms and hats at me. The other players hear them cheer, but me, I get to feel them. It's late. I should go. Just think about what I said. I will. Will I see you again, Mr. Hoy? In time you will. Hi. Hi. Your father told me that you're going to play professional baseball. He seems very proud of you. I wanted to see you, to tell you I'm sorry about my father. It would never have worked. We're different. It would have worked if not for my father. Not just your father, everyone sees me different. I don't. Son of a... Get in here. Oof! Get your hands... Hold your tongue, Mister. You listen to me, you listen to me good. I'm a God-fearing man. Oh, I am. But if I ever catch you near my son, if I ever catch you calling him a freak again, may God help you. What I'm gonna do to you... Give me that. Don't! There's no... stop it! There's no value in this. You understand me? Now, get yourself right. Yeah. I know, I know, I know, I know. I taught you fighting is never the answer. Sometimes you just gotta convince certain people what they're doing is wrong. It's wrong. You understand? That's my boy, huh. Hey, you hungry? Huh? Come on. I put a lot of money into this team. I fought hard to get back in the National League. Yes, sir; I know. I feel we have a winning team this season. - Do you? - Yes, sir. I had a scout in Oshkosh who told me of a new guy that could catch, throw, who's as quick as a panther. A deaf and dumb kid by the name of Dummy Hoy. You ever hear of him? Uh, yeah, I heard of him. Yeah, you're damn right you heard of him. He was here with my team, sent by Dooley. What the hell happened? Well, see, he ...he... he was asking for $65 a month. I figured you didn't want to pay that much for no deaf and dumb player. Do you realize that this boy played on the Ohio Independents? Do you know who they are? No, sir. Yeah. Well, if you did, you'd've signed him. The Ohio Independents is a baseball team out of a deaf and dumb school in Columbus. They embarked on a statewide barnstorming tour, taking on several National League clubs, and they fared extremely well. I didn't know he was a real player. - I thought... - Yeah. Now, I want him back! I... I... you go to Oshkosh, you get him back. I don't care what it costs. 65, 75, 85, I don't care, I want him back. But, sir, I told him that... What, are you deaf? Maybe I'm paying you too much. You go get him. You hear me? Okay. I'll bring him back. And don't go over 85. Yes, sir. Quisling. Jackass. All right, boys. I'm here to get the stats on all 'ya. I'll make it quick. Kinzie, I'll start with you. I need your age, height, - And weight. - Nah, nah, nah. You start with the new kid down there. All right. All right, kid, let's have it. Hey, kid, I ain't got all day. Hey, kid, what are you, deaf? Yeah, he is. - Lay off him, Kinzie. - Ah, come on, Krock. I'm just having a little fun with the new kid, that's all. You're kidding, right? Nope. Can't hear or talk. Ain't that right, you dummy? What's his name? Who cares what his name is? If you ask me, he doesn't belong here. I told you lay off 'im. What do you mean? I mean baseball is no place for dummies like him. Well, you're here. Oh, that's real funny, Krock. That's real funny. Laugh it up, smart ass, laugh it up. I need your stats. I need your... I'll come back to you. Like I'm supposed to stand here and trade notes all day. Kinzie, might as well give me yours. Yeah, might as well. Age 41. Height one sixty. Just kiddin'. Six foot. Weight one sixty. And I'm a hell of a ball player. How about you, Bishop? Okay, boys, up and at 'em. Game time. Let's go. Let's get out there. Dummy. Dummy. Dummy. You. No, no. You come with me. You come with me. No, no, no, no, no. No. No. You come with me. Mr. Hoy. Frank. Gentlemen, we are prepared to offer Mr. Hoy $65 a month to play for Milwaukee. He's already getting 65. Then we'll offer him 75. That will be up to Mr. Hoy to decide whether he will accept it or not. All right. Mr. Hoy, watch this. We will pay you $75 a month. No, thank you. Okay. No problem. No problem. I understand. Okay? Mr. Hoy, watch this. How does $85 a month sound? Oh. Look. I'm sorry, Frank. Oh, sure. That's 85. I wouldn't play for your team for a million dollars. I think we're finished here. Strike one! Strike two! Strike three! You're out. Go. We'll get 'em next time. Yeah! All right! All right, Dummy! Go, go, go. Go, go, go. Nice throw! That's how it's done, deaf boy. Yeah! All right! Strike one. Strike two. What are you saying? Strike three. You're out. You're out. You're out. Strike one. Strike two. Strike three. You're out. Batter's out! Yeah! Yeah, Dummy! Great catch! He didn't catch that ball. He's deaf and dumb as they come. Ain't no way he caught that ball. You're out! You better think about it, Ump. Hey, Ump. Ump, what's up? Where you goin'? Frank, I'm takin' care of it. What are they talkin' about? So kid, did you catch that ball? Of course he caught the ball. You saw it with your own eyes. I'm talkin' to the boy here. The ball hit the ground before I caught it. Thanks, kid. That's one honest ball player right there, boys. All right. Batter, take your base. He's safe? What? That's one dumb kid you got on your team there, Kinz. He could've had me out. They ought to call y'all the Oshkosh Dummies. Ahhh! What's wrong with you, huh? Are you tryin' to lose the game for us? Huh!? Back off him, Kinzie. Why are you always sticking up for him? He ain't nothin' but a dumb idiot! He didn't catch the ball. You know it and I know it. Now, get back to second. I ain't done with you yet, deaf boy. You got that? Okay. All right. Kinzie. Kinzie, what are you doin'? What? He didn't call for it. What? You gonna do something, deaf boy? You gonna do something? Boys! William! That'll teach you to mess with me. You understand that? You know fighting is not the answer ever. No, you cannot do that. Stay outta my way! I want to commend you for being so honest on the field today. I would rather lose a game than win it by cheating. Thank you. Get Kinzie in here. You boys need to get some rest. We don't need rest. You need to lay off the beer and cigars too. We're just celebratin' our win. Yeah. Why don't you include the deaf kid once in a while? He ain't like us, Frank. He don't fit in. I mean, even his name, Dummy Hoy. You don't give him a chance. C'mon, Frank. He got Kinzie kicked off the team. Kinzie got himself kicked off the team. Well, Dummy there could've said he caught the ball. Is that how you want to win, huh, by cheating? This kid has more heart than I've ever seen in this game. Hey, we got heart. Then show it. That was for Kinzie. Fighting is never the answer. Pope! What the heck! This isn't football, you know. He didn't call for it! Fighting is never the answer. Hey, Dummy, get out of baseball! You don't belong here! Hey, guys, leave him alone! Stay out of this, Kid! Just keep pitching the ball. Hey, knock it off out there! He is not one of us! He's just gettin' in the way! You get someone who can hear! Get back to playing baseball. Doesn't belong in baseball, huh? Let's see one of you guys do that. Gentlemen, this year was a disaster for Oshkosh, and I do not intend that it should happen again. Now, Frank, Mr. Porter and Mr. Hollister and Mr. Choate have come to me with the interest of putting together a winning team, and we feel that you have the ability to do so. I believe I do, sir, with the right men. And we shall get them for you. I'd like to bring in the best men that you can find. There are some players I'd like to keep, sir. Such as? Bishop, Krock, and Dummy Hoy. Uhm. Now, don't get me wrong, Frank. I like Dummy. He's honest, he's a great outfielder, and he's fast as hell, but his batting is less than desired. He's the best outfielder I've ever seen. I agree. And a fly ball doesn't have a chance in hell when he's in the outfield. But I need hitters, Frank. They quick pitch him because he can't hear. Maybe you could work with him on that. But I don't care how good he is in the outfield. If he doesn't hit, I have no use for him. Huh? We need hitters. We'll figure it out. Well, you better figure out a way for the other fellows to get along with him too. No more of this knocking him down or I'll get rid of the whole lot of 'em and replace 'em. Hmh? Sit. We need to talk. Okay. You're great in the field. You're fast. You can throw like I've never seen anyone throw before, maybe even better than King, but you're not hitting. I'm hitting. No, no, no. Your batting average is .219 this season. Mr. Sawyer wants it higher. If you don't start hitting, I can't keep you. They're quick pitching. Yes, I told them. I told them that. I told them they're quick pitching you. They don't care. No. It's the way the game is played. Huh? You have until next season to figure it out. I know you will. You are a great player, and I'd hate losing you. I'll also tell the guys to not run into you. Huh? Oh. No, no. You sure you want to handle it? You? Okay. Mr. Hoy! It's a pleasure to see you again. I want to learn to speak. I think I have the right teacher for you. Are you paying any attention? Are you paying any attention? Mr. Hoy, are you paying any attention? Mr. Hoy. What's wrong? What's wrong? You are not paying any attention. How do you expect to learn how to speak if you don't pay any attention? Your beauty has overtaken me. Mr. Hoy, unless I am mistaken, you have come here to learn how to speak. Am I right? I think I just did. Didn't you hear me? Mr. Hoy, you're something else. Now, Mr. Hoy, I am going to fingerspell a word and I want you to say it. B-A-S-E-B-A-L-L. Baseball. What are you up to? You have an idea? What? Okay. - B. - B. A. A. A-L-L. Ball. While I am at bat, you spell ball from the sideline. Ball? And I will look at you. Yeah. I swing. Yeah. Okay. Bat. Bat. Bat. Ball. You sign three. Oh, wait. Well, that... that's the base line. - B... - Oh, I'm on the... I'm on the baseline. - B-A-L-L. - B-A-L-L. Ah! Ball. B-A-L-L. Strike one. S-T-R-I-K-E. Z. Z. Your name. Your name. K-R R-O C-K TEAMMATES: C-K Your name. My name? B-I I-S-H O-P You can't see me in the... in the fog. Well, you got any ideas? Strike! What is this? Are you trying to bribe me, son? I can't take that. I can't take it. C'mon, Ump, let's play ball. Selee, get out here. Is he trying to bribe me, because if he is... Just read the paper, Ump. Selee, if this is a bribe, you two are out of the game. You got me? So you want me to raise my right arm when I call a strike and my left arm when I call a ball? What is this? Can you just do it for him? I can't play favoritism with this kid, Selee. Then do it for everyone. You... you do know your right from your left, don't you? Watch your mouth, Selee. Just wanted to know, that's all. All right. From now on, I'm gonna raise my right arm when I call a strike. Is that even legal? It's legal if I say it's legal. Come on, ump. You can't show him favoritism just 'cause he's a dumb kid. Then I'll do it with everybody. Well, I don't need it. These fellas out here don't need it. You're just doin' it 'cause he's a dumb, stupid kid that don't belong here. I'm gonna raise my left arm when I call a ball. Now, let's play ball. Strike one! See that? It's a strike. Gonna be a lot of them today. Frank, we're 14 games behind Milwaukee. Now, don't get me wrong, Frank. I think you're doing an excellent job. Even Dummy Hoy is batting over .300. Yes, sir. But it's just not coming together. We'll get it together. I know. I know. And just to be sure, I have secured Tom Lovett, Tug Wilson, Con Murphy, and Tommy McCarthy. Oh, those are some great players. Yeah. Well, speculation has it that Secretary Quinn has somehow convinced the umpires in Milwaukee to, shall we say, favor Milwaukee. Now, I need you and the boys to give it all you've got. Am I clear? - Yes, sir. - Yeah. Frank, by the way, this running into Dummy Hoy will stop. He wants to deal with it himself. He asked me not to say anything. Well, you keep an eye on it. Huh? It's great to meet 'ya. Man, you've played some great ball. I bet you're gonna be remembered as one of the best players. You too. Me? No. I play good. You, you play great. To avoid collisions in the outfield, from now on, when I am fielding a fly ball, I will make a squealing sound so the other players will back off. You really think that's gonna help? You read that? It ain't gonna happen. Anybody touches Dummy Hoy again, they're gonna be dealing with me. Is that right, Tommy? - And me. - And me. That goes for me too. Let's go play some ball, boys. Yeah! Let's win one! Y-Z. I'll be right back. Keep practicing. Okay. Listen up, boys. I've scheduled an extra exhibition game for us while we're in Des Moines. You're killin' us, Frank. Ah? We need the practice. Besides, Sawyer made it very clear he didn't want to lose the pennant this year. Where's Dummy? - I - think he went to the can. Just let him know about the game. Where the hell's Dummy? I think he's still upstairs, coach. Well, you blockheads did tell him about the game, didn't you? Tug, you're the outfielder. Beeler, did you not tell him? All right. All right. All right. Go on up. Go on. Go get him. - Is this him over here? - Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Hoy! Man, we got a game. Come on, wake up! Hey, kid, do us a favor. Climb through the transom and wake up our buddy, okay? If he ain't answerin', how you know he's in there? He's deaf, you see? I don't know. My boss wouldn't want me breaking in a room. You're not breaking in. We're giving you permission. Yeah. Who are you guys? We're the Oshkosh baseball club, and that's Dummy Hoy. Dummy Hoy? He's a great center fielder. Yes, he is, and we have a game. Well, hey, boost me up here. Team: Let's do this. He's in there all right. Can you squeeze in there? I ain't gettin' through. Get him... let's get 'im down. Get 'im down. I've got an idea. Give me a plug. Give me... give me another plug. Give me another plug. That's twice, Con. Oh. Here. Here. Try that. You hold the string. You hold the string. - You got it? - No, I don't know where it ends. - Come on, you guys. - Go, go, go. Got 'im. Got 'im. Bring it... reel it in. Fish him in. - I'm tryin'. I'm tryin'. - Reel him in. Reel him in. Here we go. Hey! Hey! Hey! Wow! The Washington Nationals are wanting you to play for them next year. Me? Yes, you. You really showed 'em, Dummy. You're a great player. You're a great player! Thank you. Follow your dreams! The Washington Nationals want me to play for them next year. Wow! That's great! Yes, it is. Why do you love baseball so much? It's one place I feel I can do anything. When I'm running bases or out in the field, nothing matters. Well, almost. What is it? Some of the guys blame me for getting our captain kicked off the team. Now they run into me, making me miss fly balls. You need to stand up for yourself. I'm trying to figure out a way. You should fight back. Fighting doesn't solve anything. You should know that since your brother was killed in one. Mr. Hoy, my brother did not die in vain. When I was young, my mother died. My father began drinking. Pa, why are we here? I can't do it anymore, boy. Ever since your mom died, I can't take care of you. Anna's doin' good. We listen to her. I know, but Anna's deaf now and there's things she can't do for ya. Pa, this ain't right. Listen to me, boy. I can't take care of you anymore, and it's not fair to Anna. I ain't goin'. Please, Pa. I don't wanna go either. I want to stay with you. - Me too, Pa. - It'll be all right. We'll be together. Let's not make this hard on Pa. - Frank. Frank! - What? I'm sorry. Go on. Ah, Mr. Lowery. Good afternoon. And these must be your children. Yes, ma'am; they are. And are you willing to surrender them? Yes, I am. It will be all right, Fredrick. Pa, don't do this. Mrs. McCall will assist you in filling out the forms, and Dr. Lattler will be examining the children. My daughter is... is deaf. Oh. And how long has she been deaf? Ah. A few years now. She took fever after her mother died. Well, we'll send her to the deaf school. No! You're not taking our sister. She's all we have now. But she needs special care, son. You ain't taking her. Frank, what's wrong? They want to separate us. No! Why can't we be together? I'm not goin' anywhere. - This is a mistake. - Mr. Lowery, please control your children. You're not splitting us up! We're not doing anything! You're not taking us! Mr. Lowery, please control your son. No! Pa, please. Catherine, I am sorry. I... I failed you. Orderlies, we need some help here, please. No! You're not doing this! Mrs. McCall, take Mr... ... Lowery to the office. Please don't do this, Pa! Thank you very much. - Get off of me! - YoT can't do this. No! Come with me. No, Fredrick, don't go. - No. - No. No. No. Anna Lowery: Wait! Wait! Wait! No! I want my sister! Anna! My brother hates anyone who drinks. One day he saw a man who was drunk beating up his daughter, confronts him. The man took out his knife, stabs him. The man was arrested. The girl was taken by a loving family and is safe because of Frank. I'm not saying I agree with fighting. Sometimes you have to stand up for what you believe in. I'm sorry, I didn't know. But if I fight back, they will say the deaf man started the fight. Use your voice, Mr. Hoy. Stand up for yourself. Is there a problem? Only one. What is it? I won't be able to come to Cincinnati much. Oh. Who will teach me to speak? I'm sure someone at Gallaudet College will help you with your voice. I was thinking of another way. What is it? I would like it if you would marry me. Are you proposing to me? I am, Miss Lowery. You'll have to talk to Mr. Crouse and Mr. Green since I'm a ward of a children's home. I'm aware of that. I'm willing to meet both gentlemen. And you may also tell Mr. Shipley. I will meet all of them if I have to. So you are a baseball player? Yes, sir. Hmmm. I see. Will you make a good salary? I already do. Mrs. McCall: He is said to be a man of honor and high morals. Yes, I have read that about Mr. Hoy. Does everyone accept him? This is a grueling final championship game between Oshkosh and Milwaukee. Whoever wins this game will win the pennant. As you can see, folks, the umpire is using his hands that the deaf-mute Dummy Hoy asked him to use so he could know what the calls were. That's right, folks, a right hand up means a strike, while raising the left hand indicates a ball. It's some game we have out there! Hit after hit on both sides. What a battle! Both teams obviously wanting this championship. Look at the speed this deaf-mute has. He's safe, folks! And Oshkosh takes the lead eight to seven. Strike! Hey, come on! You're not gonna hit .300... Hey, man, let's go! By holding the bat on your shoulder. Swing the bat. We don't win, this is gonna be your hide, you know that. This is the -T the most important game of the season. You know that! Hey! We're gonna win the game. Yeah? Promise me? Yes, I promise. StrTke! Strike? You broke your promise. - All right! - Atta boy. - Atta boy. Atta boy. - That's the way. And Milwaukee has a man on first. And there's a high fly to centerfield Dummy's underneath it. Looks like he's got it for an out. Wait! Pope ran into Dummy and he dropped the ball. - Aha. - All right! See? Come on. That man is our secret weapon. We're glad we don't have him. All right. He's helping us out. For now, all right. Two outs. I thought you had a handle on that. Dummy wants to handle it. Well, when is that gonna be? I don't want to lose this game. I want the pennant. Fighting is never the answer. Use your voice, Mr. Hoy. Stand up for yourself. Sometimes you just gotta convince certain people what they're doing is wrong. It's wrong! Fight back. Oh, my goodness, what's going on out there? Enough? Let's win this! If this keeps up, Oshkosh will lose for sure! Way to go, Dummy! Way to go! Great, bases loaded and Milwaukee's best hitter is up. With bases loaded, there's a hit. It's agood one! It's going! It's going! Dummy Hoy is chasing it down, but I think it's too far gone. Dummy is still chasing it down. The crowd is clearing out of his way. He caught it! He caught it! I don't believe it! Dummy Hoy jumped over the horse and caught the ball to help Oshkosh win the pennant! I don't believe it! This is the gutsiest player I've ever seen! No, he cannot jump on a horse and buggy like that! Ump! Ump! He can't do that! That's not legal! Doubleday would have your hide! He can't do that! That's not fair! That's not an out! That's a home run! - run! - That's a home Yes! Pa! Pa! This telegram just came in! It's from William! From William? Dear Ma and Pa, we just won... we just won the pennant here in Oshkosh, and the Washington Nationals just signed me. Thank you for believing in me. Your son, William Hoy. - That's our boy! - We're all proud of him, Jacob. Mighty proud. Mighty proud. That's our boy! Ladies and gentlemen, here today to throw out the first pitch is a man who helped change the way baseball is played today. The first deaf major league star. Will you please welcome the amazing William "Dummy" Hoy.
