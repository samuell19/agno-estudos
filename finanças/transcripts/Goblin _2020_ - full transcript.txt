Larry! Could you please try to keep up! Dr. Charles told you... 20 minutes of exercise four times a week. I know what the damn doctor said! Oh, Shnoopsie. Oh, do you have to go make a poopie? Go on. Go make a poopie. If you ever want another chesseburger at our house... you better get your ass around this block at least once! And you're gonna eat some of my weight watchers meals with me... Shnoopsie? Shnoopsie? Shnoopsie! Oh, buddy... Here you go. So, Sammy, what do ya think about the new place? I know you miss him buddy. So, this will do, eh? It's very nice. Nice? I'd say so. Split floor plan, rooms for both the boys. Big 'ol yard for Pistol. How about you Sam? Think you can handle it here? We're gonna be just fine. Danny Jr! Danny Jr! Get out here! Yeah? What? Go grab that dog's leash and get him in the backyard. Not my stupid dog. And then get your ass back out here and help me unload this shit. Little fuckin' brat. Hey... They're fine. That backyard is awesome. This whole place is awesome. Eh? We can be happy here, right? Put the past behind us? C'mon, let's check it out. The realtor says the master bath has a his and hers sink and a jacuzzi tub. Ahh! I got it. I got it! I said I got it! Can you just go find the box with the towels? Yeah. No problem. Thanks, hun. Oh! I didn't know anyone was out here. My dad said to grab my stuff! Ok. Danny Jr! Hey, uh, your dad is calling for you. Yeah, I'll be right there. Is Sam still out back? Do I look like his freakin' babysiter?! Well, Pistol seems to like his new home. You know, this place is pretty nice. I bet you two can get in at least a few adventures together here. Maybe there are some kids that go to your new school that... I don't know. Maybe there is a kid who has a friend for this big guy here. Yeah. Maybe. Dig in. Where the hell is my Beijing beef?! Sam, where not gonna color at the dinner table. Got it? What the fuck? Good! That idiot better have the rest of my food! I'll get it. Hello and good evening. I am Elias. Hi. Can I help you with something? Marguerite daisy. No... my name is Sara. We just moved into the neighborhood. Ha! That is the name of the flower. I live across the street. Welcome to the neighborhood. Oh. And lingonberry jam. Well thank you. Does he have the rest of my food or what?! Have I caught you at a poor time? No! Well, actually yeah. We just sat down for dinner. Say no more. So sorry to intrude. Enjoy your meal and welcome to the neighborhood! Goodnight. And thank you. Again. So, who's the douche bag? Get enough food Danny Jr? Yep! Here. Wait! That's mine too! Don't snatch from me! Alright, leave your stepmom alone. What? It's Chinese, I thought we all share! I said enough. Pff. I'll be in my room. So we live nextdoor to a douche bag, eh? I'm just joking. Lighten up a little. Look... It's not the biggest deal in the world. But he shouldn't talk to me like that. I know, I know... The former Smith's are so sensitive. I'll talk to him, ok? Ok? Yeah. Fine. Sam. Eat your food. Eat, honey. Headphones! Headphones, man! So... How you feeling about tomorrow? Ok, I guess. You know, I heard this school serves pizza on Monday. Hmm? And... Your teacher said there's a time just for coloring, everyday. Goodnight, mom. Goodnight, sweetheart. Huh?! What?! It's just me. Oh. Hi honey. How was your bath? It was good. That's good. You looked really beautiful in that tub. Danny... What? I thought it would be a good time to give it another shot. The doctor said six weeks. Maybe longer. Oh it's been about that long, hasn't it? I just don't think I'm ready yet. Fine! Love you, honey. Ahh! Help! Oh, god! No! What the fuck is going on?! Go! Go get it! It's outside our house! What?! What is outside our house? I-I-I don't know. Something! Oh god! No, Sammy! Go get him! What the fuck now?! Sammy! I got him. He's fine. What are you doing out here, pal? What the shit? C'mon. Let's get you back to sleep. I didn't see anything out there, ok? What were you doing up anyway? I couldn't sleep. I went for a cup of tea and I heard a loud scream... Or a howl. I don't know. Tea? Did you turn the faucet? Yes. But it was a different noise. Noises! Look... The plumbing is obviously a little suspect in this place. It wasn't the plumbing. I heard that too, but something else after. These old houses have pipes running all over. We're in a new place. Strange noises you're not used to... No. There was something out there. Why do you think the dog was freaking out? I'm not sure. He looks fine now. C'mon. Let him go and let's get back to sleep. I think I'm just gonna sleep in here tonight. Whatever. What is her problem?! Shut up and go to bed. We gotta be quick, kiddo. I overslept. Have you seen your birth certificate or social security card? Right. Whoooaaa! So, any new sightings? We don't have time for any of this. Is your dad awake? How am I supposed to know? We've got to go! What? Are you coming or not? I've gotta eat! We'll be in the car. We leave in five minutes. C'mon, Sam. Hello again, Sara. Hi... Elias. Right. And who is this young man? Say hi, Sam. What's going on over there? It seems we have a wild animal preying on neighborhood pets. Something ate their dog? Apparently, something has been eating lots of dogs lately. Corporal Phoenix! Corporal Phoenix! I saw something last night too. It ran through our yard and bushes. Something what? I don't know. It was just... big. Very large claw... or hand. I've never seen anything like it. My husband had me thinking I'd gone crazy. Something was definitely here last night. You should tell those men what you saw. You said five minutes! I can't talk to anyone right now. These kids are late for school. Did you see something too, young man? Yeah. A green man. C'mon, Sammy. We gotta go. Sara... Mhmm. Would you come and see me when it is convenient for you? I would like to hear more of your encounter last night. Ok. Yeah, sure. Until later then. Ahhh, I'm tellin' dad! So, you and the old idiot telling ghost stories later? Get out. Smell ya later! Whoa! So, Sammy... What were you talking to that nice man about? Just the green man. Did you see something last night? Outside our window? Is that what Pistol was barking at? Yeah... I think so. What else did he look like? Hey, it's ok, you can tell me about it later, ok? We got a big first day at a new school! Wait, wait, wait, wait. Well, hello. You must be Sam. You know, I heard that you are quite the artist. I bet you have your own crayons and everthing in that backpack. What do you say we go find you a desk to put all of your supplies? Have a good day, buddy. I'll see you this afternoon, ok? Honey! Seems you still have your marbles after all. Don't you start your new job today? Well I did have and eventful evening last night. Slept right through my alarm. Normally, we don't see large predators wander this far into town. Just remember, keep your pets and small children inside until this all blows over. So. I told them what you saw last night... They think we might have a cougar on our hands. Maybe even a bear! Can you believe that? Are you still heading into work? Huh? Did you hear what I just said? There's a wild beast roaming around here and I'm gonna kill it! You don't even know what it is. How do you plan on killing it? Last night you were begging me to kill... whatever it is. Yeah, and you treated me like a fool. Honey, I'd love to stay and discuss this but I'm burning daylight. What? I've gotta get Danny Jr. And get down to the sports store. Word of this gets out and the whole place is gonna be crawling with a bunch of idiots and yahoos in no time. I just dropped Danny Jr. Off at school. Yeah, I know. Any luck, and we're eatin' cat tonight. Sara! Please come in. Nice home. Thank you. Tea? Ok. So, are you an archaeologist or treasure hunter or something? Perhaps in another life. I was a professor of history, a very long time ago. Hmm. I never asked you where you were from. And I thought the lingonberries surely gave me away. Denmark, my lady. Oh. I've never been. And what about you? What about me what? Where did you move from? Oh. Um, about 50 miles north of here. Camp Jackson. Ah, Sam's father was a soldier. Stepfather. Yeah. Oh, forgive me. It's ok. Sam's dad was a soldier too but... He's no longer with us. I'm so sorry to hear that. So, you said you wanted to hear about what I saw last night, but... I'm not sure what I saw. Or if I even saw anything at all. Besides, the animal controller people or whatever said it was probably a mountain lion. Or a bear. Yes, I've heard. You think it could be something else? Do you know how rare those two animals are for these parts? One or the other could be identified, but it can't be both. Well, which one do you think it is? Neither. May I show you something? These look like some old books. This one is nearly 500 years old. How does one come across a 500 year old book? Oh, lots of ways I'm sure. This one has been part of my family since... The beginning, I suppose. Well, it's very cool. Haha, yes. I'd say so. What is this? This is a village in chaos. Why are they doing all of this? Do you remember what young Sam had to say about last night? The green man? Does this look like what you saw last night? Like I said, I'm not sure what I saw was anything. You said it had a large hand or a claw... Like this. What are you trying to say? This... thing is running around our neighborhood snacking on dogs? It has many names. We call it, Goblin. And, yes. It will continue to eat whatever it gets in its wretched grasp. Look, uh, this is a fun story and all. You saw the beast yourself. You described what is in a book you've never seen before today. Surely, your son saw it too! The professionals are calling this a cougar. Or maybe a bear, ok? I wouldn't be surprised if they've caught it by now. I assure you they have not. Really, I have to go. I'm sorry. Please, be careful Sara. Well, hello. Hi. Um, is Sam in another classroom or the office or something? Sam's father picked him up early today. Maybe 12:30. Wait, who? Danny, right? And Sam's older brother, Danny Jr. Uh, stepbrother. Mmm, intersting boy... They said it was some kind of family emergency. Well... I hope everything is ok. Good day. Excuse me. Do you have a minute? Danny Jr! I'm right here! What?! Don't... you back sass me boy! Get your brother and that damn dog inside before your mama gets home. I don't have a mom. Or a brother! C'mon you little idiot! I'm a take a nap. Watch you little brother and don't let him or that damn dog out. That damn cat is still out there. We're gonna catch it next time. Wooo! Hey idiot. I'm not watching you so stay inside. Stupid little idiot. God! Do whatever you want! What the hell do I care?! I hope a puma eats your ass! Sam didn't get a chance to finish this on account of his father picking him up early... But, I thought it was... a little peculiar. You know... We don't like to pry... But, is everything ok at home? Ma'am? I'm sorry. I just remembered something. We'll see you tomorrow. Shut that dog up! Shut that god damn dog up! What the fuck?! Hope your ass gets eaten too! Pistol. It's ok boy. Sammy? Sam? Sam? Where the hell is Sam? How the hell am I suppose to know? You ever hear of knocking? Where is Sam? Wake up! Where is my son?! Isn't his brother watching him? I told him not to go outside. I told him not to go outside. Sam! Oh god! Sam! I was so worried! What are you doing out here? Tell me! Why are you out here?! I'm sorry mommy. What happened? I just thought it would be good for him to come with us. Please, just leave us alone. What's the big deal? He's fine. You're fine, aren't you pal? He's just a boy! And you left him alone outside with that monster roaming around! A monster? It's a darn cat! And last I heard it hadn't eaten any boys. Please just leave us alone. Danny Jr. Grab your shit! We're goin' back out! I'm gonna double back around to the south. If you see anything, you shoot it! Please, come in, come in. Thank you. I know what you think. And the drawings are strange... sure. I am not at an impasse. I am sure now of what is out there. I mean, but really. How could it be this? Where did it come from? And are there more? And if you're so sure let's call the police. No, no. They will treat us as crazy as we sound. Well, what then? How do you get rid of a... Goblin? You don't. It has found us here and it is not leaving. It will eat and eat until there is nothing left. And then, I assume, it will find somewhere else. Well it's not invisible, right? Someone else is bound to see it. Who sees the tiger before it is too late? It seems the boys are back from their hunt. We better go. You must leave, Sara! They won't believe you. No one will. Until it is too late. It's not that simple. Ok, we just moved here and we're gonna give things a try. Maybe this is all a coincidence. You know, they probably caught whatever it is. We both know they have not. We gotta go. C'mon, Sam. Good news, honey! Sammy, take Pistol and go to your room. Where were you guys? We need to talk about something. Did the big weirdo put the moves on you or something? Yeah, what's all this I hear about Frenchie wanting to "see you" tonight? Can we speak in private, please? Later. We've got some work to do. Let's go boy! Watch this boy. We're gonna start down here by the base of the neck. And then work your way all the way around... to the back. Surprise! Rawr! Rawr! Rawr! Nothing to worry about now, honey. Your man got him. Hey! I helped! We'll finish this up here, put a bag on it... take it into town tomorrow for the mount. Probably get our picture in the paper too. Oh, hell yeah! We got you, you big dumb cat! A little gratitude? We got him. You know? The monster that scared the bejeezus outta you last night. Remember? Almost ate little Sam earlier today. Oh, I wish! Well, we'll all sleep a little better tonight. Mom! Mom, come look! Mommy! Look! Mother fucker! God damn it! Ah, what the fuck! Danny Jr! Hey, buddy. How long have you been up? Danny Jr! What's wrong? The damn cat is gone! That's what! Gone? Yeah, fuckin' gone! Poof! Call animal control. Fuck that! This bear is mine! What if it's something else and not a bear? Yeah, like what? A scary green monster? Has anybody seen my damn headphones? Hey, where's the cat? Danny Jr. Told me what you and Sam were talking about with dummy from across the street. I swear. I don't know what it is, ok? Where's the cat? Fucking animal control turd is still out there. Go tell him what happened. What the hell is going on? Go get ready for school. Nobody's goin' anywhere. All right! What? Do we have any meat? Where in the hell are my headphones? What do you mean no one's going anywhere? These kids need to get to school. Everybody shut up! Nobody is going anywhere until I catch that bear. A bear? Got our Cat? You boys get in room until I tell you otherwise. I said get in your room! What do you mean a bear?! You want to test me, boy? Alright, geeze! Hey... Go wait in your room, buddy. Danny... Can you please slow down. We're gonna need some meat. What the fuck? What the... Can we please just talk about this for a minute? You think I'm gonna listen to your mumbo-jumbo monster tales? Huh?! I just don't think it's a bear. Shut up with that garbage! I thought it wasn't gonna be like this anymore... And I thought I just told you to shut the fuck up! Keep your fuckin' mouth shut! Hello again, sir. How's it going? Come again? Catch that cat yet? Hey, hun. Can you tell Jr. To turn his music down, please? Hun? Honey! The music! Is everything ok here, sir? Oh, sure. Ya'll catch that cat yet? Um... We're not so sure it's a mountain lion, actually. Oh, yeah? Maybe people's dogs just runnin' away? Doesn't look like that's the case. Oh. We found this... in a pile of scat. Scat? So, it is a bear? That ain't no bear shit I've ever seen. Well, what then? There's a few theories goin' around. Carl here thinks it might be a crocodile. A crocodile? Around these parts? Yeah... Probably not. Apparently one escaped a zoo 20 years ago... Maybe. We set traps around the outskirts of town yesterday. Whatever it is, we'll catch it soon enough. Good luck. You sure everything is alright? Of course. Ma'am? Everything's fine. You mind if we take a look in your backyard? Uh, actually we're just about on our way out. Just a quick peek then, huh? There ain't nothing out there. Believe me. Yeah, sure. Go right ahead. Thank you, sir. Looks like your dog got into the trash. I'd recommend some lids on those cans. And remember, keep your dogs and- Dogs and kids inside. You got it. You all have a good night. Fuckin' idiots. That thing ain't in the woods. Where the hell your keys at? Nobody leaves this house. You hear me? Yes. Get your ass in there! You have seen the beast! There's no beast around here, sir. Just a hungry dog. We must help them before there is fire! Hey, Sarge. We got a litter of kittens missing in Middleton. Why don't you head on home, eh? Leave this to the professionals. We're on it. Sam... Oh, Sammy. It's gonna be ok mommy. I love you honey. Come here. Sara! Um, now's not a very good time, Elias. You must leave now! It is here! I can't leave. I'm sorry. You must listen to me, Sara! I can't leave. Now please go before my husband gets back. Sometimes... we find ourselves in places we oughtn't be. But we must still try our best. I want you to tell me about the green man. Nobody likes him. But he's our friend! Pistol likes him too! Sammy, is he real or just a game you and Pistol play? He's our friend. He's really nice! Hey, go wait in your room, ok? What the hell is this now?! Hey old timer! We don't need any of that crazy you're sellin'. You hear me?! Keep your ass away from here! We'll hang these up right before dark. We're gonna catch that sneaky bastard. Go get that kid of mine. Uh, he's -- he's not here. What the hell you mean he's not here? He wasn't in his room. The window was open. Get in here! I thought you said the window was open! It was. I closed it. I don't know where he's at. So he just vanished too? Danny please! I think we should leave this place. You've been talkin' to Frenchie again. I thought I told you to keep your ass in your room! Shut up! What the hell are you still doin' out here? Samuel, get in your room. I said now! I think it's time he start listening to his father. Hey honey. Sorry about earlier. It's just that damn bear. And Danny Jr. Taking off just when I need him most. Little fuckin' bastard. You know I love you guys. Alright then. Yes ma'am. Fresh start tomorrow! Alleen door brand. Elias, what are you doing? What are you doing?! Only by fire! Elias stop! If my husband wakes up he'll kill you! We must cleanse this place of the beast! Elias stop. My son is asleep in there. Mommy? Shhh. We're leaving this place. We can't leave Pistol! Pistol. C'mon. Sammy, stay here with Pistol. Don't make any noise, ok? Hey. Oh, you scared... Shhh! Mommy? Go start on your homework buddy. Hello, ma'am. Hello. Sorry to just pop in on you like this. What's going on? It seems that we have some information on your husband and son. Stepson... Right... Well, some hikers found your husband's dogtags. Found them where? They were found in a big pile of shit ma'am. Uh... a big pile of scat. Not too far from here. It was old. Months probably. Nobody has seen your neighbor in some time either. Elias Rasmussen? I'm sorry to give you this information. Excuse me, ma'am? Yes. Nevermind. Sorry again.
