It killed on me. You okay? - Oh, yes. I'm fine. I'm fine. - [Farmer] You almost met your match that time. - What you mean by that? - Well, that was Kyle Lockwood. Shoot, wait till the sheriff hears he's back. He hates his guts. - The prodigal son has returned, huh? This aught to be real interesting. [contemplative music] [horn honking] - I told you it was him. What the hell are you doing here? I thought you were in LA. - I'm just driving through. - Don't tell me. You suddenly got this irresistible urge to see me. And now you want to go to the motel and make wild, passionate love to me all night, right? - Is it that obvious? [horn honking] - Go around, asshole! - [Parker] Move that piece of shit! [horn honking] - [Wendy] Up your, Parker! - [Parker] Move it along, Wendy! - I can't believe you're back. Come on down to see me tonight. I'm waiting tables at the old Riverside. See you later, heart breaker. [calm music] - [Carl] You didn't do shit to that car. - The hell I didn't. I spent two hours trying to tune up that piece of shit. But it's like I told you before, you gotta get those valves fixed before I can tune it up. Just give me goddamned keys back. - The money. - I don't let nobody screw me around it. - [Billy] Get your hands of me. - [Kyle] Excuse me. - Get lost. - Now, that's sort of the problem. I am lost. Right, Billy? - Yeah, he's lost all right. - Look, dickhead. This is none of your business. This a-hole is trying to screw me. - You wouldn't do that, would you Billy? - Nah, I only screw my friends. - Here. Take it, you grease ball, whine-o. Now, where's my keys? - In the ignition of course. - You guys just went to the top on my shit list. [engine cranks] [tires squealing] - Another satisfied customer. - Damn, it's good to see you again. [laughing] Hey, it's. It's tea time. So how long you been in town? - About 20 minutes. - Seen anybody? - Yeah, I ran into Wendy. Surprised she's still here. - I'm surprised anybody's still here. - Julie still around? - That's not why you came back is it? - No. - She got married about a year ago. - Anyone I know? - This guy, Lynch, Gene Lynch. He came here, holy shit, about five years ago. He bought up a lot of land. He practically owns the bank. - And the bankers daughter. - Yeah. Thinks he's hot shit. Guess everybody else in town agrees with him. He drives around like he owns the county. - In a red 240 SX? - Yeah. - We met, on the highway coming into town, had a little cha cha cha. - You ran him down? - Sure hope he got his car out of the ditch okay. - Damn. I would've given anything to seen that. [laughing] So how long has it been since you've seen Aaron? - [Kyle] Not since Dad's funeral. [calm music] [grunting] [laughing] - Kyle? I don't believe it. Oh hey, we saw you on TV, racing about. When was that, about two years ago? - More like five. - Oh really? Well, I guess we have a lot of catching up to do. Oh shit. Hope you guys are hungry, because there's plenty of food. - Smells great. Can we give you hand? - Sure. Why don't you mash those potatoes? - Anyone else want a brew? - I thought you were cutting back. - Oh, it's just a beer, Sis. come on. Don't worry. One Rocket Billy Bone special coming up. - I can't remember the last time I mashed potatoes. - [Sally] Hey, if you're good at there's plenty of opportunities around here. - Tractor belt busted again. We have to get a new one. - Well, I just got one. I'm sure it's in my- - Don't worry about it, Sally. Just order a new one. What brings you back? - Just visiting. - Well, you could have called. - Thought I'd surprise you. - Yeah, well you are good at that. How's the garage? Still in business? - Yeah, if you can call it business. - Yeah. I'm gonna go wash up. Excuse me. [tense music] [crickets chirping] - So, what's on the agenda for tonight? - The usual. Good booze and wild women. - You with a wild woman? Been taking bee pollen again? - Hey, that was just my experimental period. - I thought we might stop by, and see Terry on the way into town. - Terry split. - You're kidding. Terry? Where would he go? - He didn't say. - He just disappeared. - Yeah, it was really out of nowhere. Everybody knew he was having a hard time of it. He got into a heavy loan with the bank, and they were really coming down hard on him. Just to disappear like that. I guess he must've felt ashamed. - Any more potatoes? - Sure. I'll be right back. [crickets chirping] [phone ringing] - That's for me. - Can I get anyone anything else? - No thanks, Sal. - I've got to go out for a bit. I'll see you later. [sighs] - I'm sorry. I just can't stand to see him like this anymore. It's driving me nuts. I just wish he'd tell me what's wrong. - There's probably a lot of pressure on him, to try and run the farm. - We've always had that. This last year, it's been something else. I don't know. It's like there's something eating at him inside, and he won't tell me what it is. I feel like I've been frozen out of his life. - Maybe I can talk to him. - Would you? - I can try. - Thanks. I'm gonna go wash my face. [tense music] - I think I need a beer. [country bar music] - I need to Mich Drys, scotch and soda, Jose Cuervo. - Christie, have you seen Wendy? - She was here a minute ago. She was out dancing. [country bar music continues] - That son of a bitch. - Better keep you eye on that one, Carl. [music fades] - Thanks. - The pleasure's all mine. - That's probably true. I guess I better get back to work. - Yeah, I better go find Billy before he empties a keg. - Stick around. You might get lucky. - Okay okay okay, I'm a little drunk. But, don't tell me your valve covers don't need a little tightening up. - We gotta go. - Hey, no you don't. No you don't. - [Girl] Sorry, Billy. - Calls for a toast. [grunting] - That Bud's a little strong for you, huh Billy? - The only thing that's strong around here is your breath, mother fucker. - Yo Ted, I think our buddy Billy here is drunk. - He's running his mouth. - Fuck off. [punch lands] [grunts] - Ted, I'm gonna take Billy outside now. [Billy gagging] [punches landing] [Billy gagging] You're not so mouthy now, are you Billy? Maybe you'd like to apologize. - Eat shit and die. [kicks landing] [gun cocks] [gun fires] - Get away from him. - What are you doing? Put it down. - Get away from him! - Hey man, don't get weird. It was a fair fight. - Back off! Come on. [Billy coughing] You all right? - Yeah, I'm just great. - Want me to kill him? - You crazy. - Am I talking to you? - Why not? He's just a worthless piece of shit. - You can't do this. You just kidding, right? - Sorry. - Hey, don't. Please. Don't shoot. - I'd feel bad about this. You got any kids? - No. - All right. - Hey, wait! Don't! [gravel crunching] [sirens blaring] [police radio chattering] - Yeah, I think he was just in a hurry to change his shorts. - Carl's one of those people that I have no sympathy for. Guy's a sociopath, plain and simple. Why Lynch hired him is beyond me. Anyway, what's the story, Kyle? I thought you were out in the coast, racing cars. - Guess I just needed to take a break. - Think you'd be helping Aaron with the farm, or what, just to visit? - Haven't really given it much thought. - I hope we get a chance to have a beer before you hit the road again. It's been a while. - What's he doing here? - Carl McCormick caused a little ruckus with Billy down at the bar. - I heard shots were fired. - They were beating the crap out of me. - It was no big deal. - Let me make this clear from the beginning, Kyle. Don't try me. You do whatever business you have here in town and get out. Did you write him up? - Well, no. I didn't think there'd be any need to do that. - Discharging a firearm in the city is a violation of the code. Write him up. - Yes, sir. I don't think Don's too happy to see you again. - Guess he didn't mellow much with age, did he? - The way he treats you, you'd think you were the only one who ever raced around town in a hot car. I'm beat. Can we get out of here? - Sure. I'm on my way out too. [phone ringing] - Hey Gordy, I've been meaning to talk to you about something. What'd did you guys find out about Terry Thomas's disappearance? - Nothing. He just left. He wasn't first, and he won't be the last. It's not so unusual around her these days, Kyle. It's not the same as it used to be. Come on, let's get going. - This has gotta be some kind of a record. Quarter mile without spilling a drop. Thought you might want to take a break. - No, thanks. - Need a hand? - No. So you gonna be around a while or what? - If I'm not in the way. Suit yourself. You've got as much right here as I do. It's half yours. - What do you say we go down and get a couple of beers after you're finished? - Hard to say when that would be. - Well, I'll help you. - I don't want your help, Kyle. - Look, Aaron. I know we've had some pretty major differences in the past, but can we talk this thing out? Something's bugging you, that's obvious. Why won't you tell me? - My life is none of your business. You want to hang around here killing time, that's up to you. But you leave me alone. Why don't you run along and play with your damn car? [tense music] [dramatic music] [gun cocks] - What the hell are you doing here? - I'm a friend of Terry's. I was just looking for him. - Who are you? - Kyle Lockwood. I just live down the road aways. Terry is my friend. - Well, he isn't here anymore. - I kind of suspected that from the shape of this place. Guys mind putting the guns down? - I think you better haul ass out of here before I call the sheriff. You're trespassing. - Know where I can find Terry? - [Thug] No. - Okay. You guys have a nice day. [tense music] - [Guest] Nice place you have here. - [Gene] It's a roof. - You'll have to come out for a Cubbies game sometime. - I would like that very much. - Okay, Gene. We'll give you a shot. I'll call you later to set it up. Keep us happy and you won't be sorry. - I have never been sorry. - I'll be in touch. [suspenseful music] - It's all right, gentlemen. Everything is cool.

Doesn't strike you as strange that Terry would suddenly up and leave his home without a word to anyone? - Nothing strikes me as strange anymore. This whole state is going down the tubes. - Hey, Rita. Can we have a couple? Thanks. - I don't believe you. You're so out of it that you don't realize it when one of your friends disappears? - What do you mean by that? - Nothing. Just drop it. - You mean, am I so plastered? You got a lot of nerve Kyle. You don't know what's been going down here. You're the one that's out of it, 10 years out of it. You really don't think I noticed when Terry took off? He split owing me five fucking grand.

Could you tell me who I'd see to find out about a transfer of property rights? - One of the loan officers could help you right over there. - Yes, Mrs. Cutler. But you are two months behind on your payments. Why don't you see if you can't cut something out of your budget? [knocking on door] You don't want to lose your house. Yes, I know you will. Goodbye. - How's everyone at home? - You know farmers. It they don't have something to complain about, they'll make something up. He's kept the place going, which is more than I could have done. - More than you wanted to do. I'm sorry. - That's okay. It's no secret I didn't want to run the farm when I was 20. - I guess the real secret is what you did want. Did you ever find it? - Look, Julie. I didn't come here to get another one of your, you started it arguments. - I haven't started- - I came here to find out who foreclosed on Terry Thomas's property. Can you punch a few numbers on your computer there and find out? I'm sure he had a loan with the bank. - Yes, he did. Sort of. - Did the bank foreclose or not? - No. - Terry came to us for a loan, and he was turned down. So he went to a third party. When Terry left, he forfeited, and the third party took a lien out on the property and paid off the outstanding balance to the bank. - Who is this mysterious third party? - My husband. - Gene Lynch owns Terry's farm. - Yes he does. Why? - That's what I'd like to know. - What is all this about Kyle? - Hello, Kyle. What brings you back to town? - Hello, Mr. Parker. - You seem to be having quite a discussion. Anything I can do to help out? - Kyle was just asking about the Thomas property that Gene bought, Dad. - Really? Well, I'm sure you were concerned about your friend's disappearance, as we all were. It was an awkward situation for all of us. I just hope that Terry is doing well, and will come back to us someday. There's nothing shameful about failing at farming these days. That's what I tried to tell these farmers. - Well, I want to keep you from your jobs any longer. - If you have any more questions, Kyle, feel free to stop by. - I just may do that. Nice chatting with you. - Get lost. - Feeling a little threatened? [contemplative music] [tense music] - I don't think he's expecting you, Mr. Lockwood. What's it about? - Business. - It's all right, Carl. Mr. Lockwood is more than welcome here. Go ahead and send him back. [tense music] [door slams] Kyle. Good to see you. Business, huh? Well, come on back. We can talk here. I hope you've come to see me about a little rematch. I fear my sense of caution got the better of me the other day. - I understand that you're now own Terry Thomas's farm. - That's right, yes. If you're interested, I could probably swing a loan for you down at the bank. I kind of have it in down there, if you know what I mean. - I was more interested in the arrangement you had with Terry. - Oh, that's simple. Terry had his up against the wall. He needed money. I offered to loan him $50,000 against the farm. Next thing you know, he up and split. I guess he just couldn't handle the pressure. - What pressure? - Being in red ink up to here. That can get to you after awhile. Poor sucker didn't know whether he was coming or going. - Why did you loan Terry the money? - Well, it's not because I'm your good neighbor Sam. We both know that. Look, Kyle. I'm a businessman. Making money as all I know. When I see something I can get on the cheap and sell it a fat profit, I'm interested. I didn't know how Terry could work things out, things being the way they were. I figured I could get some more land cheap. - Did Terry tell you he was leaving? No, I heard it from one of the girls at work. Can't say that I was surprised though. He always had the feel of a quitter to me. - Well, I won't take up any more of your time. I just wanted to get a little more information. - You looking for Terry? - Yeah. You might say that. - Owe you money? - No. You see, I know Terry was no quitter. His great grandfather settled here in 1887. He would've eaten beans in the chicken coop before he gave away that farm. It would have taken more than reading to chase him away. - Well, you never can tell. I've seen junkies in Chicago sell their wedding rings to get a fix. - Yeah, well. We'll see. - Hey, if you're ever interested in exercising that dinosaur yours again, give me a shout. I'll give you a quarter mile headstart. [country bar music] - What's the great tragedy? - Nothing, I was just thinking. - Yeah, I gave it up. Gives you wrinkles, you know? - [Waiter] What can I get for you? - And for that pearl of wisdom, you can buy me a drink, buddy. Gin and tonic water. - I'll have a shot of Cuervo and another draw. - So how's Billy doing? - Just fine. I think he was too drunk to feel anything. - Sorry about the whole thing. - I guess Carl was just mad at me for dancing with you, and he took it out on Billy. - Sure know how to pick them, Wendy. - In case you haven't noticed, there's not a whole hell of a lot to pick from. Anyway, Carl's definitely off my Christmas card list. - Not that. Not the Christmas card list? - Yeah, I like to make him suffer. - You are cruel. - And unforgiving. [country bar music continues] - What should we drink to? - To about closing time. [crickets chirping] [Gene chuckles] - Something wrong? You look like you're lost in space. - Sorry. I'm just thinking about some things at work. - Well, maybe I can help you get your mind off it. - Oh God, you spilled the wine. - Forgot about it. - I have to get it right away, or it'll stain. [crickets continue chirping] Gene. What are you doing? - I said, forget it. - It'll ruin it. - I like things ruined. - Good night. - To love, honor, and obey. For richer, for poorer, till death do us part. As long as you both shall live, say it. - What? - Do you, Julie, take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband? Say it, pumpkin. - I do. - You may now kiss the bride. [crickets continue chirping] - [Weather Man] That's gonna give us lows in the 15 degree mark tonight. Bundle up. [door opens and closes] - You're putting in a long day. - Guess I'll call it a night. - No. Sit down. Have a drink with your little brother. To mom and dad. May they rest in peace. I still remember the night you left. I woke up in the middle of the night, heard all this screaming going on. It was you and him going at it in the kitchen. I thought, one of them is gonna kill the other for sure. I put a pillow over my head waiting for a shot or a scream. But all I heard was the back door slam, and your car start, and the gravel kick up as you tore off. He stayed up till dawn waiting for you to come back. But you never did. Mom went around crying for a whole week. But old Avery pretended nothing happened. He did his work. He read the paper. He listened to the stock reports at noon. Never said a word about you. Don't know if he was mad at himself or you. But you know he was never the same after that. But you were smart, Kyle. You got the hell out of here. You're free. - Maybe my life is not as wonderful as you think. There is a price for everything. - Oh tell me about it, big brother. Let's hear some of your road weary philosophy about your rough life in the fast lane. What do you know about paying the price? You skipped. I paid it for you. I'm the one who had to work his butt off 16 hours a day, trying to keep this godforsaken place together. All you ever did was just run around your car, acting like you were some big fucking deal. Spare me the bullshit. - I can't do anything to change the past, Aaron. But I'm here now, and I'm willing to help you. - You're not here to help me. Christ. That is a good one. Kyle. You couldn't care less about me. You're here 'cause you're scared. You're scared you're not gonna make it out there. You want some place to hide. Well, it's not gonna be here. This is my place. I built it. I sweated over it, and nobody's gonna take it away from me. - I'm not trying to take it away. [somber music] - Nobody. [contemplative music] He stayed up till dawn waiting for you to come back. But you never did. Mom went around crying for a whole week. But old Avery pretended nothing happened. - [Julie] Kyle, it's Julie. Listen. I think that we should talk. Meet me at the old school house in the morning. [country bar music] [voices overlapping] - What's this? - Nick bought a round of drinks for the house. - What'd he do, win the lotto? - He sold all that river land he was trying to unload. - What dumb sucker bought that? - Gene Lynch. [upbeat music] - Place sure brings back the memories. - It does. I just wanted to say I'm sorry about the way I acted in the bank yesterday. I think seeing you just stirred up a lot of old memories. - Good or bad? - Both. - Yeah. They seem to go together a lot, I've noticed lately. - Why did you come back? - It was sort of impulsive. I was driving West in Kansas, stopped at 3:00 AM to get gas and, suddenly got the urge to come home. - Did you think that I'd be here? - I pictured you here. - Really? How did you picture me? About 10 years younger, I suppose. - Actually you were much older, with long gray hair. You were at your parents', in the parlor playing that big piano. Almost the music I remember more than the image. [humming] What's wrong? [suspenseful music] - [Julie] I guess I don't understand why Terry would just leave town. It sounds awful doesn't it? [suspenseful music continues] [birds singing] - You're just gonna go back to him? - I don't know. I don't know what to do anymore. I just need some time to think. - Meet me later. No pressure, I promise. - When. - Six. At the theater. - Okay, but just for a bit. - When did he leave? Just tell him to call me if you hear from him. It's important. No, I'm not drunk. Goodbye. Kyle! - What's the matter? - You're not gonna believe this. If you don't believe me, you can just go look for yourself. Gene Lynch has got a lien on your farm. He must have loaned Aaron the money, just like he did Terry, everybody else. Kyle, the guy owns all the land along the river. - It's all hills, rocks, gullies. It's useless for farming. Why would he want that? - I don't know. - Want to find out? - Why not? [contemplative music] See anything? - Just weeds and trees. - Maybe he just likes to live next to a river. - Let's go down and get a closer look. [suspenseful music] - Man, we've covered six or eight miles and got zilch. I'm beat. Let's just call it a day. - Did you hear that? - What? [shushing] - Listen. - That sounds like a pump. - Let's go. [suspenseful music continues] Someone's irrigating something. Let's have a look. [suspenseful music continues] - Oh shit, it's marijuana, acres of it. - I bet this isn't his only little spot. That's why the river property. Plenty of water, and impossible to spot from the air. - He's a drug dealer. Can you beat that? No wonder all the easy money. He's laundering the cash. You think Aaron's involved with any of this? - I don't know. - And I'd love to see Lynch get what's coming to him, but not if it means burning Aaron too. - Why would he do something stupid like this? - He's broke. He's scared. He's desperate. Same reason as a lot of other guys. - Yeah. You're right. Come on let's get out of here. [phone ringing] Yeah? What? Well, how the hell did they find it? Damn. Damn it. All right look, look. This is damage control time. You get a crew out there, and you strip every plot that we haven't picked yet. I'll get somebody to take care of these fuckers. [tractor engine rumbling] - What do you want? I'm working. - I need to talk to you now. - What? - I want to know what's going on around here. - I don't know about you, but I'm trying to harvest my damn crop. - Does that include the pot growing down by the river? - What have you done? - Billy found out at the courthouse that Lynch has been buying up all the property up and down the river. So we checked it out. And we found a marijuana patch growing on our property. - Stupid son of a bitch. He has video cameras down there. He knows you were there. He'll... [suspenseful music] Sally. [dramatic music] [gun fires] - Sally! - I think I shot him. [crying] - It's okay, baby. It's okay. Sally and I have decided to tell the sheriff everything and take whatever comes. - It can't be too bad if you weren't selling it. - There's something else you don't know about. I saw Terry and Michelle killed by Lynch's men. It's been eaten at me for a year now. But I was afraid to tell anybody for fear of what might happen to Sally. I'm really sorry for the way I've been treating everybody. - Don't worry about it. We're behind you all the way. - Thanks. - How's Sally doing? - Okay. She's still a bit shook up. She's packing to go over to Aunt Addies. Well. I guess I got to make a phone call. [somber music] [police radio chattering] - I left a message for the sheriff with his missus. He should be here real soon. Should we get started with this? - I think it's that one, Gordy. - Let's get to it. - All right. [suspenseful music] - This'll set the county on it's end. Gene Lynch involved in drugs and murder, the story. [suspenseful music continues] He's dead all right. - We've got company. - Jesus, it's Lynch. - Better radio for some help. - I think I can handle you dumb assholes myself. You blew a good thing, Aaron. You should have stayed cool. [suspenseful music] [gun fires] [dramatic music] - Come on, Kyle! [dramatic music] [gun fires] [suspenseful music] [guns firing] [suspenseful music continues] Kyle, I killed Gordy. - Hush. [suspenseful music] Come on. [birds singing] - [Aaron] Hands up, asshole. Don't move. [rock and roll music] - [Carl] That idiot. What the hell is he doing down here? [guns firing] - [Aaron] Oh shit. They're coming, Kyle. [rock and roll music continues] [guns firing] Son of a bitch. [guns continue firing] If you get ahead of them, I can get a shot. Now. Now Kyle. [guns continue firing] [rock and roll music continues] - Now. Let's fucking go! [rock and roll music continues] - [Aaron] I'm out of shells. [rock and roll music continues] - [Kyle] Hang on. [rock and roll music continues] [car exploding] - Go. Go. - [Announcer] 17 left in the half. Byron Bennett's gonna have to have the ball, held by Johanne Lewis to kick if off, because the wind keep blowing if off the tee. But the Oscars have overcome a 45 to 14 lead. And I agree entirely with you here, Gary. The whole package it's on the line with, I think, the most talented team. Here's the kick. - Billy? - [Announcer] And it is Oliver, about seven yards. Then we'll come out to the 20 yard line. - Yeah, I'm just finishing up. You need help with something? - No, it's personal. - [Announcer] In the previous portion of the broadcast. The problem with Lassiter was clearly not a problem with lack ability, as a lack of expertise. - I hate to ask you. But I don't know who else I could go to. We were supposed to meet at the theater at six. I just can't do it. - [Announcer] And he's filled with hope. It's Missouri's first and 10 a the 20 yard line. A minute, 17 to go in the half. - Thanks. I'm sure that you don't understand. - You gotta do what you gotta do. - [Reporter] This is a KOTD news alert. Cass County Deputy Sheriff, Gordon Myles, has been found dead. Authorities believe the local deputy was slain during an arrest attempt, and are seeking Aaron and Kyle Lockwood in connection with the crime. Contact the local sheriff's office if you have any information regarding these suspects. - Oh my God. - What time did you say you were gonna meet him? - At six. [suspenseful music] [engine revving] - Billy, wait! I'm coming with you. - Hurry up. [suspenseful music continues] - Jesus, Kyle. This is crazy. She's Lynch's wife. She probably told him where to find us. Get rid of her. - Hi. Remember me? - I'm busy. - What's the matter. Did I interrupt some sibling rivalry? - I can't talk to you right now. - Look, if you're mad at me, why don't you just say so? - I'm not mad at you. - Wendy, get the hell out of here now. - Up yours, Aaron. Who the hell do you think you- - Just go. - Here they come. [suspenseful music] - Damn. - Come on. - Stop! [dramatic music] [suspenseful music] - How many left? - Who's gun is that? - Three. - Why the hell did you have to follow us? - I don't know, 'cause you were running. [shushing] [suspenseful music] - What's going on, Kyle? - It's a long story. - Can you give me the "Cliff Notes"? - Gene Lynch had Terry killed. Aaron saw it. We showed Gordon the body, and it turns out he's in with Gene, and Carl, and all the rest. Aaron grabbed the gun, and it went off. - Kyle. - Was he hurt? - Yeah, he's dead. - It was self defense. They were trying to kill us. [grunting] [footsteps approaching] [guns firing] [suspenseful music] [body thumps] [suspenseful music continues] There's the roof. Go. - Wait a minute. Where's Kyle? - I don't know. He was right behind us. Let's go. - Hold it. You ain't going nowhere. [gun firing] [somber music] - Get out. Kyle, come on. - [Kyle] Billy, wait. [suspenseful music continues] [gun fires] [tires squealing] - What's going on? - Aaron's been hit. We've got to get him to the hospital. - No, not here. - You'll bleed to death. - We've got to get him out of town. - Where are we going? - I don't know, just drive. - It's just gonna be cops along the road. - We can go to my uncle's. He's out of town. - Okay, go. [tires squealing] - We've got the main highways all covered by deputies. But I want the back road blocked off too. Those guys know that country too well. Now along the river, I've got four possible intersections. - I think we can cover those for you, Don. That's sort of our turf. - Okay, Carl. That's along river road north of town, here, here, and here. The rest of you will come with me, and we'll start a sweep. Stay on channel 23, and no talking. Questions? Fine. Let's get on with it. - That's about all we can do right now. How's it feel? - Like a vice grip. - I got the truck all rigged up. I think it'll work. - All right, let's go. - Kyle? - Take it easy, Aaron. [crickets chirping] [calm music] - You gonna be all right? - Are you? I love you, Kyle. - I love you too. Come on, give me a hand, all right. Watch his arm, feet first. Watch it, watch it, watch it. Okay get the bale. Cover your eyes. Hang tight, there. - Okay, I'm gonna go to Blair. Take me about a half hour. - [Kyle] Thanks, Billy. - [Billy] Watch your ass. Hey, Julie? - That's for me, I take it? - Yeah. - I didn't even have the guts to give it to you, let alone tell you. It seems silly now. - [Kyle] Do you trust me, Julie? - [Julie] Yes, I do. - I can't explain everything right now but, I need your records down at the bank. - Which ones? - Your husband's currency transaction files. - My father oversaw them personally. - I still need them. - All right. - Thanks. Wendy can give you a ride back to town. I'm sorry. - So am I. [somber music] [crickets chirping] - There's a coffee machine down the hall. This could take awhile. - Once a waitress, always a waitress. - [Julie] Dear Kyle, they say you should be careful what you wish for because it may come true. I think I understand that now. Since you left, I've had an emptiness in me that I thought only you could fill. No matter how hard I tried to forget, it was always you who came to me in my dream. And through all the years I've clung to the thought that you would come back and we'd be together. But that can never be. Time has parted us, and my little girl dreams have to die so that I can find out who I really am. Please try to understand, love Julie. [calm music] - You know, one of the first signs of marital difficulties is spending too much time at the office? [suspenseful music] Oh, what have we here? Don't you want to share your work problems with me? - Dad? - I had no choice. It was either take his money or let the bank go under. It would have destroyed the whole community. - According to these files, Sam, you accepted some rather large deposits from me that you didn't report. That's against federal regulations, you know? It almost looks like you've been laundering money. - You bastard. This is the end. I don't care what happens to me or the bank. I'm turning you over. - You really don't care, Sam? Well, I don't really care either. Hey. We don't care, right? Live or die. What difference does it make? Good. Let's go. [suspenseful music] [phone ringing] - [Wendy] Kyle. Kyle, it's me. - Where are you? What's going on? - I'm at the bank. I get locked in. - [Kyle] Where's Julie? - She left with Gene and her dad. He's got a gun. [grunting] What should I do? Kyle? Kyle, are you there? Kyle? - Come in, come in. Mi casa es su casa. Nothing ever turns out the way you plan, does it? I suppose this means they're gonna take my name off the JC's plaque. God. How did I last here so long? It'll be good to get back in the real world again. Why are you so glum? Nobody's ever what they seem to be, baby. Not daddy-kins here, not hubby, not even you. That's right. You're not the innocent prom queen anymore. - Don't touch me. [phone ringing] - Cass County Sheriff's, Deputy Ross. Yes, sir. Oh, no kidding. Okay, hang on. Hey Don, it's for you. - Get a number Phil, I'm busy. - It's a Washington County Sheriff. They got Aaron. Billy brought him in last night. - Kyle? - No sign of him, and Billy's not talking. - Well, we'll see about that. - Yeah. I'll need it first thing this morning. I'll need full tanks, and I will give you my flight plan when I get it in. That's right. Well, put it on my bill. Thank you. I love it when the call my Mr. Lynch. Money does weird things to people, you know. Here you go, my darling, a little token of my esteem and affection. Open it. Please. I hope they fit. They only had one size. Well, I guess it's time to depart this veil of tears. God, listen to me now. Down, Sam. Down, down, down. You don't know how much pleasure I would derive from shooting a banker. Put them on. Just think of this as the honeymoon that we never had. And Sam, no stupid phone calls. It is virtually impossible to get blood out of genuine leather seats. Sayonara. - Goddamn it, where the hell are they? Lynch will be here any minute. - Chip, do you copy me? Chip, goddamn it. This piece of shit. [static covered voices from radio] Come again? Your signal's too weak. - Put it away. Here they come. [suspenseful music] - What's going on? Where's Gene? - [Carl] He'll be here. - Who's this? - This is the nosy little asshole who turned us in. I bet your shitting your pants. - What'd you bring him here for? - To blow his fucking brains out. - No, we don't want any part of this. Murder wasn't in the deal. - But, why should you care? You guys don't have casualties in Chicago? - [Guest] I think we'll wait till Gene gets here. - Who are you? - You know damn well who we are. - [Chip] This is Chip. Air support is in the vicinity. Where are you guys? - [Carl] It's a set up. They're cops. [gun fires] [dramatic music] [guns firing] - Shit. - Chip? Chip? Get that backup in here now. [guns firing] [dramatic music] - There's Gene. Gene! Gene! [suspenseful music] [guns firing] Where are you going? What the fuck? [guns firing] [dramatic music] - Hey. Hey, Gene? What the hells going on? - Please help me. - [Gene] Everything ready? - Yeah. Go ahead, take it. - Good. Get down on the ground with your hands behind your head. [airplane taxiing] [truck engine revving] [dramatic music] [laughing] - You are one crazy son of a bitch. - It's over, Gene. It's all over. - For you maybe. Are you dizzy? But you're seeing double too, huh? You're dying, Kyle, slipping into darkness. Can you feel the darkness coming on? [laughing] Hey, winners and losers, pal. That's all there is to life. No hard feelings though, huh? Business. [dramatic music] [sirens blaring] Thank God you got here, Don. I didn't know what I was gonna do next. It looks like we caught it just in time. - Good work, Gene. You all right? - Oh yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. A bit shaky I guess. - Better give me the gun now. - Sheriff, drop your gun or I'll blow your head off. Now. That's right. Right, we got no problems here. [suspenseful music] I didn't want to have to do this, Don. I mean how would it look, you arresting the JC's man of the year? [suspenseful music] I got Julie in the cockpit. If anybody moves out here, I kill her. [suspenseful music] So long, guys. It's been fun but I gotta fly. - Gene. Look out behind you. [laughing] - Come on, Don. You can do better than that. [loud thumping] [Julie screams] [calm music] - I don't know how we did it, but we did it. It almost looks too pretty to drive now. Okay you guys, get in the shot. - Come on, Billy. You get in the picture too. Okay, everybody. Say Cheerios. - [All] Cheerios. [camera clicking] - Oh, it's beautiful. You guys should really be proud. - What guys? All they did was gab about their childhood and drink beer. This is car is 99% Rocket Billy Bones. - Yeah, right. - Here, I mad you some sandwiches, in case you're not quite ready for that diner food yet. - Feels like there's enough for a week. - Gonna miss you, Kyle. - Gonna miss you too. I'm gonna miss all of you. - Well, Christmas is just around the corner. We expect to see you then. - It's a date. - Have you heard from Julie? - She's down in Kansas city with her aunt. She seems to like it okay. She going to school. - Gonna make a visit? - I think I'm headed in a new direction. I better give this buggy a test ride. - Now, don't burn her up the first day out there. I don't want to have to tow you in, okay? - You ever needed someone to talk to, give me a call, I'm in the book. - Heck yeah. - If you see Wendy, tell her goodbye and, give her my love. - Yeah, will do. Audios. [contemplative music] - Well. Take care, Kyle. - I will. - Hey. [contemplative music] - Nice car. - Nice outfit. What are you doing? - What? - Nice outfit. What are you doing? - What people at bus stops usually do. - Where are you going? - I don't know. I thought I might check out LA for the Winter. - What are you gonna do when you get there? - Whatever I want. Better move your car. The bus will be here soon. - What do you want from me? - I don't know. A ride, maybe, if you're going my way. - Okay, get in. - Are you sure? - Yes.
