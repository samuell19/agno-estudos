[patron] Oh, hey. Thanks! [TV host] Late, 19th century. Tell me, have you ever considered having it insured? [Joey] That's worth a thousand bucks. [regular] Come on! No one's going to shell out a grand for a cracked tea cup. [Joey] You wanna' bet? [regular] Yeah. Five bucks. [Joey] Alright. You're on, buddy. [TV host] Well, what if I was to tell you that this tea cup is worth somewhere in the neighbourhood of five hundred pounds? [TV guest] Five hundred pounds? [Joey] Thank you very much. [regular] How'd you know that? [TV guest] Good lord, man, we've been using it as a dog's dish! [Joey] I happen to know a thing or two about antiques. [TV host] No, no! That won't increase the value very much! [Joey] Actually, there's a kind of a trick to it. If they don't ask a lot of questions: Probably not worth very much. But if they start talking about insurance? Bingo. Watch. [TV host] You can really see the fine brush stroke. Very fine indeed. Tell me. How much did you pay for this? [TV guest] Well, 25p perhaps? [TV host] Have you ever thought about getting this piece insured? [Joey] There! [TV guest] It never occured to us. [TV host] Well, I would definitely have this piece insured in around fifteen to twenty thousand pounds. [Joey] See what I mean? [TV guest] Twenty thousand pounds? Good lord! [TV host] Stay tuned.

What are you talking about? You're not giving it up, are you? [Tino] Tino Mariano give up? I don't think so. [Rita] I can vouch for that. [Tino] It's my last gig in this city. This time next year - I'm going to be with the Continental Opera Company. Ever heard of them? [Joey] Well, yeah. Who hasn't? [Tino] Yeah. It's just a matter of settling a small contractual obligation. [Joey] So pretty soon it will be, what, the four tenors? [Tino] Well at least I can turn one head around here, huh? [Rita] Tino!

He's learning to control himself. From what I hear he could be out in... Seven, maybe even six years. [Angie] You know, a lot of things can happen in six years. Particularly to a woman. She could lose her looks, become bitter and lonely, completely undesireable. [Artuso] I can appreciate what you're going through, Angela. [Angie] Can you? [Artuso] Of course. That's why my lawyers are working around the clock looking for an angle. I have an obligation to you. You are family. So don't worry. They'll come up with something.

[Angie] I dunno. [Artuso] Don Alfonso thinks so. But, the sweetheart of a friend, she beggs to differ. Oh, there's a beautiful aria in that opera... 'Como scoglio' You know what that means, Angela? [Angie] No. [Artuso] 'Like a rock' It's what she sings when she's asked about her relationship with her absent husband. Like a rock! Capisci?

[Tino] Don Giovanni. He gets all the girls, right? [Artuso] Mamma mia! Hey! What a kid your age knows about opera puts an old aficionado like me to shame! [Tino] You mean that, Don Artuso? [Artuso] That was a tough question! [Tino] Then how come, if I'm such an expert, you didn't believe me last time when I told you that I was ready for the Continental Opera Company? [Artuso] Tino. I've told you. The Continental - [Tino] 'The Continental Opera Company, Tino, that's the Mecca.' 'The brass ring.' 'You're good, Tino, but you're not that good. At least not yet.' [Artuso] Exactly. Hey - [Tino] 'I'll keep footing the bill until me and nobody else but me decides that you're ready.' [Artuso] Hey, when the time comes - [Tino] 'When the time comes, when you're really ready, Tino, I can get you in just as well as anybody else.' Huh? [Artuso] Mamma mia. This kid's got a good set of ears, huh? You remember everything. [laughs] [Tino] Don Artuso. How much money would you say you've invested in me over the past three years? [Artuso] I don't know. Ten, eleven thousand dollars maybe? [Tino] You know, Don Artuso, in some circles, many would consider you a foolish man. And I know you feel about looking foolish. That's why I'm offering you an early return. [Artuso] Oh? [Tino] I'll buy your shares from you right now for twelve thousand five hundred. Now, you may think a yield like this is peanuts. But a node on the larynx, a bad notice in the New York Times, and believe me, you'll be damn glad that got out when you did. What do you say? [Artuso] I say, uh, where does a kid like Tino Mariano come up with that kind of money? [Tino] How do you come up with yours? [Artuso] Ah... So you want out of your contract, Tino? Alright. You're out. [Tino] Just like that? [Artuso] Yes. But there's a special clause in your contract. [Tino] Special clause? [Artuso] Yeah. The shotgun clause. [gun clicks] You little bastardo. How dare you make me play Barnaba in La Giocanda! Huh? Believe me, Tino, I can hurt you in more ways than Ponchielli ever dreamed of! [Tino] Ponchielli wrote the music. Boito wrote the libretto. [Artuso] That's it. Rub it in you assasino. You want to sing, huh? Alright. You sing. When and where I tell you! And don't worry about being able to open up your throat.

I have seen them set for evening of baccarat and roulette. I have seen them adorned for sumptuous dinner parties that have become the stuff of legend. But I have never seen them the way that I see them tonight. As the saying goes, the tables have been turned. And it is you honouring me instead of me honouring you.

[Angie] Congratulations. [Joey] Yeah, hey. Congratulations, uh, Father, oh- [Father] Anthony. [Joey] Anthony. So where do you two go after this? [Father] Las Vegas. [psychic] There's a big psychic fair there. [Father] By the way, Angie, the flowers were exquisite. The best I've ever seen. [Angie] Well. I had some help. My new parnter. [Joey] Yeah. I'm selling the restaurant. Well, you know, I figured I'd pay off my bank loan and find a divorce lawyer for her. You know any interested local entrepraneurs? [Tino] I was thinking, that, uh, maybe we could go get some wine together and, uh... [crowd chatting] [Pat] I'll admit, I wasn't entirely satisfied with the quality of the merchandise that the old Don was offering. But... The given is that the tide always turns back home. Well, let's just say you won't be getting any such trouble from me anymore. So, what do you say, Don di Miglio? [Silvio] I'll think about it. [Pat] Joey, my good man. The Don would like to have a word with you. [Joey] He wants to see me? [Pat] Can I buy you another drink, Father- Uh, Anthony. Anthony. [Father] I thought you'd never ask. [Silvio] You know, I've been going through the books, Joey. And I found a marker. From your father-in-law. He was quite the gambler, wasn't he? [Joey] Uh, yes. He was. Yes. [Silvio] It's a sizeable amount. With interest. You know, my first instinct though is to dismiss it as nonsense and wipe it from the books. [Joey] Oh, really? [Silvio] But there's an old saying: 'No good turn goes unpunished.' Eliminating your debt would be a discredit to the memory of the last Don Artuso, wouldn't it? [Joey] I - [page ripps] [spits] [Silvio] There's another old saying, Joey: 'One good turn deserves another.' You saved my life and I'll never forget it. And Joey? I heard about you and Angela.
