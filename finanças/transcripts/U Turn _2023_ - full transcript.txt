Hi. I am really sorry, man. But I've come pretty far. Okay. I am coming. Okay. I'll come. Slow down. You seem to be in a hurry to send me back home. Mom, chill. No, you chill. Since you've been living on your own, you have become pretty fast. Stop wasting time, and get to the point. The point is. I never complained about finding whiskey and vodka bottles in your garbage bags. Never said a word. But... condoms? Would it be okay if I did it without a condom? Don't try your journalist tricks on me. And if things go sideways, I will have to clean up your mess. Wear your helmet, mum. If the cop catches us, I will have to pay the fine. I will deal with the cop. Come on. Yes, I am at the bus stop. I'll be home in two hours. Okay, bye. Listen. I ordered these for you. It's an evil-eye bracelet. It will ward off your evil eye. Thanks, Mom. Take care. And don't go looking for trouble. I'll take care of you and Dad as well. And my job is to go looking for trouble. Your embrace is as warm as your brothers. Guess I must tell him, to look after you. Mom, please stop talking about Raghav. You have to get over it. Okay? Get going, please. It's getting really late. Okay, listen. When are you introducing me to him? The 'protection' guy. Isn't he your boyfriend? Why? Can we have sex only with boyfriends? And, if I keep introducing you, to all the 'protection' guys, you'll have to start a dormitory. Please, it's getting really late. Go on. Please. -Really late. -You are so shameless. Very shameless. Bye. Dhruv missed his bus. Come back and drop him off at school. Why don't you drop Dhruv off at school? Your work is important to you. Not your family. -Leave it. -Fine, I am coming. Hello... Sikha. God. Good God. Your parents will get a heart attack someday, because of you. Those two are pretty solid. Made of steel. Touchwood. Which reminds me-- Did the guy the other night have any steel? Really? His Insta-pics were pretty hot. I thought this one will go next level. Personality is necessary, for taking it to the next level. Some character, at least. Conversations are important. -Yeah, share the report... -That's true. Yup. He can do it. All night... chat. Not interested. Hello... All that's left for him to do is tattoo his arm, saying 'I am obsessed with Radhika Bakshi.' What good is a tattoo? If he's into me, then he should tell me. And anyway, I don't have superpowers. I can't read minds. That reminds me, you should drop your story on NTPC. I can read the editor's mind. It's pretty vague. Shut up. It's much better than your story, on '7 easy ways to lose Diwali belly'. It's topical, man. It sells. I am spreading happiness. But who fell over the flyover, how many got run over by a car, who died on the bridge, is too dark. Life is dark, Divya. You can try running from it, but that won't change reality. This story is very crucial to me. How nice, Deepak sir. Gifts have been pouring in lately government offices. Is the AC not working again? This is the result of hard work, sir. But I guess you're not familiar with it. Stop grinning. Otherwise, I'll break your jaw. Get lost. Go. Why are you gloating over a minor issue? What do you expect if someone has to be reminded of their responsibilities? I came back, didn't I? Can't imagine what happened at the office because I was late. I was screwed. Couldn't even answer nature's call. So what? A typical housewife follows the same routine every day. Did you ever bother to ask me how my day was? -Did you? -Listen, Sikha. -If you can't be polite with me... -Polite? Where do I find this politeness? Go pluck it from a tree or something. Dhruv, let's go. Come on. -Where are you taking him? -Let's go, Dhruv. Shikha. Where are you taking Dhruv? Shikha. Hello. Note down this address. Tell me. Deepak Kumar, SBP Homes, Sector 126, Mohali. Thanks. -Hey. -Hi. I needed some help. Sure. Can you get a report on every accident, that occurred over the last year on the NTPC flyover? Why? I am writing a story. Of course. I'll get it by evening. -Thanks. -Then coffee? I don't drink coffee. Gives me acidity. How about some beer in the evening? I am okay with that. Sinha. Sir. What brings you here? I could've handled this. Orders from superiors. He was the housing minister's PA. Not again. Where is the bathroom? This Dhillon will never grow up. How did he spend so many years in forensics? It was the same story over there. I wonder how he joined the police force. What do you think? Looks like suicide, but not until we've proven it. Who found the body? Thanks for coming. I was scared you might turn me down. I made the first move on you a year ago, you turned me down. Yeah, but I was confused. I thought you wanted to be friends. Friends with benefits. What? Were you always like this, or did you fall on your head? I have fallen lower than you think. Life is short. Dozens of stories to write. If we get stuck on the first paragraph, how will we do justice to justice, Mr. Iyer? Yeah, that's also true. You read my blogs. Why? Can only you cyber-stalk me? No-- There we go. Thanks. I had a great night. Yup. Me too. Coffee? I don't get acidity at this hour. Have you ever gone steady? You know like "he's my guy". "I've been with him for a year." One month. That's my longest. Right. I like to chill, you know. Just go with the flow, and I think free-floating is legit. It's overrated. Because when you find someone, you want to hold on to... I think that's dope. Okay, then. I'll see you around. Until then, enjoy your free-floating. Hello, madam journalist. Where have you been, Ms. Bakshi? I've been calling you. Why didn't you answer? See. But other times-- Not fair. No, I was in a place with loud music. I didn't notice. Oh, I see... with your new boyfriend? None of your business. You'll know my business down at the station. Come on. Get in the car. Why, sir? What for? Why are you nervous? Did you do anything wrong? No? Then come along quietly. We are always helping you, time to return the favour. Come on. Lata. -Let's go. -What help, sir? What is wrong? -Sir, what is wrong? -Madam, don't give sir a headache. You can't take me without telling reason. You have to tell me what has happened. Did your husband drink? Was he in any depression? No, sir. We would often fight and patch up immediately. A woman came to your house after you left. Any affair-- Sir. Radhika Bakshi. What is going on here, sir? You cannot arrest me like this in the middle of the night. I know my rights. And we know your wrongs as well. These are today's millennials. You are not under arrest. You have only been brought in for questioning. Look at her. Do you know her? No. Who is she? Mrs. Sikha Kumar. You went to her house last night. There's an entry in the register. Deepak? Did you kill Deepak? Deepak is dead. Hello, excuse me, madams. If you solve the case amongst yourself, are we here to fry fritters? Tell me. Why were you at her house yesterday? Sir, I-- Take her to Sinha. -I'll be right there. -Okay, sir. -Let's go. -Don't touch me! Please cooperate, Ms. Radhika. Come, madam. Come. Come. Hello, sir. Yes, sir. We are questioning her. We cannot draw conclusions right now, sir. Could be murder. This is a misunderstanding, sir. I did go to Deepak's house last night. Why? To check up on him? To get his interview. I am writing an article, and I just needed a byte. At 10:30 pm? Yes. Because I am usually busy in the morning. I go to work. What happened when you were there? No answer. I waited five minutes and then left. That's all. Why did you bring him flowers? Prize for creating a public nuisance. This is how these people should be embarrassed. Sir, this girl is taking us for a ride. I am not taking you for a ride, sir. If you don't believe me, you can ask my colleague Divya. We are both interns at ND Times. Last six months, I've been doing a story on the NTPC flyover. What story? People move the divider blocks on the NTPC flyover and take a U-turn. And leave without putting the blocks back. This causes several accidents. I mean, if you see the stats, almost 25 every year, out of which at least 18 are fatal. Authorities, RTO, traffic police, they all know about it. But no one does anything. But... how is Deepak Kumar connected to all this? Sir, my story is about those who move these divider blocks. I hate those who break the rules. And want to know how they don't hate themselves. Deepak was one of them. How do you know? There's a beggar that sits on the flyover. 'Bauna' (midget). Brother. He notes down the number of all the vehicles, and gives them to me. Thanks. Yadav sir has sworn to hate journalists. But, I swear, sir, I am telling the truth. If you don't believe me, I have 10 other numbers. Can we get those numbers right now? Yes, of course, sir. They all moved the divider blocks and took a U-turn in the last six months. Sodhi. Get all these numbers checked. How many have traffic violations against them, etcetera. -Check it. Now. -Yes, sir. Keep this girl in custody tonight. I find her story a fake. Sir, why lock up? There is a lot of pressure. What if this turns out to be murder? We need a suspect. Sir, she doesn't look like a suspect to me. Why? -Because she is gorgeous. -Sir. Just joking. A sense of humour is a must. Otherwise, all these dead bodies and wailing families, will drive us nuts someday. -Understood. -Yes, sir. Get all the information from her politely. Don't use any force. Remember. -Because she is a woman. -Yes. That. And she is a journalist. They have a habit of cooking up stories, which start sounding true eventually. It's an old problem of a new India. Right, sir. What happened? Can't enjoy tea without a cigarette? You can take my bosses for a ride, not me. Understood. Prepare the lock-up. She is our guest for tonight. This is totally unfair. I can sue you for this. You confiscated my phone. I need to call my lawyer. My friends-- I am trying to help you. Maybe you won't need a lawyer or a friend. Understood. That beggar. Can he confirm your story? Of course, he can, sir. Yadav, get the car. Take Madam to the NTPC flyover, and get the beggar. Don't listen to her, sir. She is taking us for a ride. Then go take a ride. NTPC flyover. Where to now? Over there. That? Let's go. Shine the light. So... where is the beggar? This is his spot, sir. Let's check downstairs. CH-06-UY-1309. Why is there a traffic penalty against this vehicle? Sir. Over here. Sir, it's suicide. And there are no other marks on Deepak's body, or struggle signs. Even his blood report is clean. The reports will arrive tomorrow. -And the time of death. -Between 12 and 2. Sir. The beggar is real. But the story still seems fake. Can I be the judge of that? Let's go. Sir. Something isn't right. Get up! -Get up! -Sir, what are you doing? Leave him. He cannot tell you anything. Sir, talk to me. We'll have to talk to you. Who else knows about these 10 people other than you two? No one else, sir. Trying to be over-smart? Did you ever meet anyone? Yes. I interviewed a couple of them. Speak up, or I will gut you! Speak up. The beggar only gave you numbers. Where did you get the address? -Where did you get the address? -From the RTO, sir. I met a guy called Harry. We met while getting my licence. But what is the problem, sir? These 10 people mentioned in your diary, are dead! Speak up. I said speak up. Why did you kill them? They are all suicides. Tell us the truth. Sir, I swear I don't know anything about it. -It must be a coincidence. -Really? All the deaths occurred within 24 hours of noting their names down, and you are saying it's a coincidence. Speak up. Speak up! You are hiding something, Ms. Bakshi. Don't force me to use my methods. I swear, sir, I don't know anything about it. Then who does? I beat him down to size, but he didn't say a word. Sir, I told you he cannot tell you anything. He cannot speak. What? Is this a joke? Why didn't you tell me before? I found this piece of paper in his pocket. What is it, sir? Whose number is this? Whose number is this? Maybe the vehicle that took a U-turn today. Careful, Dhillon. Look at the nameplate. Advocates are no match for the Punjab police. We'll deal with him. Don't worry. -Greetings. -What's wrong? What? What's wrong? Are you guys out of your mind? -It was an emergency-- -What emergency? Ringing my doorbell in the middle of the night like a madman. Do I have to explain the rules? Sir, this is an emergency. Do you know this girl? Who is she? Who is she? You woke up my child. Oh... we are very sorry. Can you quickly identify this number? CH-03-Z-6006. Is this your vehicle's number plate? Yes, this is my bike's number. So what? Did you move the divider block on the NTPC flyover today and take a U-turn? Who complained? She did, right? So you did take a U-turn? Who gives you the right to question me like that? So did you fine me for it? How can you just barge in like this? This is not right-- How can you enter my house? Please cooperate. What cooperate? How can you enter my house like this? Are you new on the job? Are you new on the job? Listen to me... If he comes into my house without a warrant, I will get him fired. We didn't come here to stay. We are only doing our duty. We'll leave. -Tell him to come out. -Calm down. You'll wake up your son. He's going into my mom's room. I will get him suspended. -I will get him suspended. -Sorry. Sir, come out. Tell him to come out. This is enough. You know you crossed the line. Watch what I do tomorrow. Watch what I do tomorrow. Tomorrow is unpredictable, Mr. Sachdeva. Keep your doors and windows locked today. Don't spike your BP! It will affect your kidneys. -Let them. -Let's go, madam. The court opens at 9. I'll see you tomorrow morning at 9 with a legal notice. At your police station! I will get you all fired. Fired. You know what, you two stay here tonight. Call me immediately if you notice anything strange. -Yes, sir. -Yes, sir. Give me the keys! Sir. Yes, Yadav. Sir, I am at traffic control, and looking at the footage. That same bike was on the NTPC flyover today. Bring the footage to the station. Okay. There is some connection between all the deaths. Radhika, is there any other information, that might have slipped your mind? I have no idea what's going on, sir. I told you everything I knew. Try to think... Radhika, don't come out! Siddhant. Siddhant. Siddhant. Siddhant. As you can see advocate Siddhant Sachdeva... Sir, I don't know how this happened. Madam was with Sinha sir all the time. -Tea. Tea. -I came down to alert security. Tea. And suddenly heard madam's scream. Move back. I say, sir, we made a big mistake. We shouldn't have left him alone in the first place. When someone has a death wish, there is nothing we can do. Sir... believe it or not, this is not what it seems. Shut up, Mr. Karamchand. It's a simple case of suicide. And only ghosts can commit such murders... Probably. The guy fell face-first. Did you notice that, Lata? My uncle lived in Kannur. My own uncle. Same to same... One night he got up after finishing dinner. He made his usual drink, in front of the mirror. Soon he felt a stench, of something unfamiliar. He thought someone was staring at him. Before he could scream-- The mirror swallowed him. Did he die? Disappeared. If Saxena sir was here, you would have disappeared too. Understood. You and your stupid stories. Sir, can you tell us about last night's mishap? We heard the entire event happened in police protection. What was the police doing, sir? According to our sources, the police are also probing the black magic angle. Could there be a ghost involved, sir? Ghost or not, Mr. Bhaskar. Bhaskar... But your source is definitely a... Get my point. Out of my way. -Sir... -But, sir-- Sir, tell us something-- He was absolutely fine a while ago. He came home tired. Worrying about money and business is common. But him... he is not even a year old. Who will look after him? Did you hear anything? Anyone coming inside, or-- I am hard of hearing. Sometimes I can't even hear him cry. I didn't even hear the balcony door opening. Sinha... We were still dealing with the Deepak case, and you got us another one. Sir, these are not simple suicides. Then what is it? Paranormal activity 10? Who is giving this nonsense to the press? -Suspend him. -Give me some time, sir. I can see a clear pattern. 10 people dead who broke that one rule. This can't be a coincidence, sir. There must be some connection. You haven't found any lead yet. That advocate jumped to his death. And Deepak slit his wrist. End of story. Case closed. But, sir, why would anyone commit suicide unnecessarily? And none of them was undergoing depression or therapy. Siddhant had taken a loan. The loan sharks threatened to come to his house. Did his mother tell you this? Why on the day he took a U-turn? Are you listening to yourself? I can prove it, sir. Why, Sinha? Why? Do we have all the time in the world? Don't we have better things to do? First the midget, then the U-turn and ghosts. Aren't you ashamed of yourselves? I've to keep eating every two hours. I am a sugar patient. Get lost. Get lost, everyone! -Sinha. -Sir. Send your friend back home. Right, sir. Radhika. Radhika. We are here. Do you still think I am lying, sir? Arjun. That's my first name. And my feelings don't count. We just need answers to questions. And as of now, we are getting none from your story. But if the answers are out there, we will find it. Go get some rest. 'All these 10 people mentioned in your diary, are dead!' 'They are all suicides.' 'Did you kill Deepak?' 'All the deaths occurred within 24 hours of noting their names down,' 'and you are saying it's a coincidence.' 'Who will look after him?' Where were you all morning? What's wrong? Why the long face? I haven't slept. Oh, F***! Adi... etcetera. I was wondering why your face was glowing. Can I talk to you for five minutes? Please. I messed up, didn't I? Look, I didn't want to be overbearing, so I just blurted nonsense last night. I just don't want to be another guy, that you discuss with Divya. And look, I've been waiting for this moment for a year. Okay, can we just pretend this never happened, and start over. And, I think, we should have a beer together. What do you think? I am busy today. It's alright. We can go tomorrow. I am free the day after too. I have to turn that story in this week. I can't. I am sorry. Does Raghav actually speak to you? Why do you ask? No reason. You haven't said anything for a long time now. He is restless. When some things are left unfinished. They tell those close to them. Maybe he's trying to tell you something. I have to go, Mom. Listen, dear. Whatever happened that day was destiny, child. It was meant for him, not you. And no one can change this fact. You drive, bro. I am dead tired. Tell me something new. Let's hire a Uber instead. Don't be an idiot. After the morning yoga class, my legs are pulp. Okay, fine. But swear you'll convince Mom for the bike. Trying to use me for your needs. Because you are the sensible one. If you say bikes are safe, Mom will say yes. Everyone thinks I am stupid. That you are. Now let's go. You went to meet her and didn't tell me. I wonder why she is so tense these days. Did you do something? Why don't you say something? Brother. I am sorry. You got involved in all this because of me. Keep this. Now you are going to die. Hey... do you have a death wish? Don't you eat? -It's heavy. -Move aside. Stop. Stop. Don't do it. U-turns are not allowed. What the-- Since when did traffic police start recruiting gorgeous girls? No nonsense. Okay, fine. We won't take a U-turn. Will you come with us? Straight. Just shut up. This is for your own good. Okay. Otherwise, what? Come on. -I said don't do it. -Are you out of your mind? Leave it. Hop on. Come on. Hop on. Wait. Wait. She is clicking our pictures. Go ahead, madam. I always wanted to be famous, Come on, let's go. Let's not invite trouble. Let's go. Look ahead. -Sir. -Yes. Here are the reports on all the accidents, that occurred on the flyover over the past year. Good. -Here's what you do. Call forensics. -Okay. And call all the doctors, who performed their post-mortem. -Yes. -Sir. I'll do the needful. I can get it done faster. He is right, sir. Let him do it. Right. Correct. An accident occurred on the NTPC flyover two years ago, Yadav. Raghav Bakshi. Get every detail on him. -He is Radhika's-- -Arjun. See. Speak of the devil. You must save them. I tried to stop them, but they took a U-turn. Who did? They were two boys. Two hours ago. I had no way to explain to them the consequences. I took their pictures after they left. This is the number plate. We can get their address. Madam! Don't you have enough work at the office? Doesn't your boss take you seriously? Sir, even you know their life is in danger. From who? Ghosts? -But, sir-- -Enough, madam. Otherwise, I will forget that I am talking to a lady. Just like I am forgetting my sense of humour. Fine, sir. But, if anything happens to those two boys-- I will handle her, sir. Let's go out and talk. Sir, I will handle this. I'll do something. Sir doesn't understand, but it's the winds. Tell Saxena sir all about it. The winds are doing this? Just do your job. Unbelievable. Radhika. Radhika, listen. What is Saxena sir's problem? Doesn't he understand what's happening, to people who take a U-turn on the NTPC flyover? -In the next 24 hours-- -Why didn't you tell me? -What? -About your brother! What difference does it make now? I understand the entire case now. Your brother died due to someone's irresponsibility. So you hunt down irresponsible people using your story as an excuse, and kill them. I didn't want to believe it, Radhika. But it's too goddamn clear now. I must order an official inquiry now. You must. And the first thing on your list should be, if I am killing them, why did I come to you for help? To clear your name as a suspect. Then how did I kill the lawyer, while I was in the car with you? You think I'll let off these rule-breakers so easily? I want them to die every second of their fucking lives. Whatever happened with Raghav that day, wasn't his fault, nor was it mine. But if anything happens to those two guys, it will be definitely someone's fault. And I know very well who that will be. -Stop pushing. -What are you guys doing? -Sit down. -Tell us what we did. Why are you locking us up? What did we do? Where are you going now? At least tell us why we are being locked up. We'll tell you. Don't worry. Have this tea. Courtesy of our boss. Don't think you can lure us with tea. Son, this is not a lure. Sometimes the government is a good host. Take it. Get some rest. We brought you here for your own good. I told you she will report us. But no... you thought it was funny. Now laugh. Shut up, rascal. Are you here too? Hello. Madam. I have a gift for you. When they find out what you did for them, they will thank you. Hey... Are you out of your mind? Wow! Cardamom tea. We are lucky, bro. To get cardamom tea at the police station. Drink some tea and get some rest. Yes, Harry. I just texted you. I need all the addresses. So many U-turns in a single day? No. These are the number of all the vehicles, that met with an accident. I'll send you the address. Thanks. I know you smoke. Those are not cigarettes. This is a police station. You'll get me in trouble. Doesn't sound funny anymore. Thanks for keeping those boys safe here. You can go home. I want to see what happens. If anything happens at all? Aren't you scared? Another meter trip? Sir, come quickly! -Dhillon. Dhillon. -Dhillon. -Dhillon. -Dhillon, are you okay? -Dhillon. -Dhillon. Dhillon, what happened? -Dhillon, are you okay? -Over there. Inside. Open up. Open it quickly. Get the keys. Open it. Give me the keys! No, Yadav. Dhillon, calm down. Hey... Back. Back. He is dead. Hey... Hey... What are you doing? -What's in your hand? -Drop it. -Lower it. -Drop it. Lower it. I said drop it. Lower it. Lower it. -Sir, don't go forward. -Dhillon, shut up. -It's the winds, sir. -Shut up. Stay back. Stay back, sir. Shut up, Dhillon. Hey... Lower the gun. -We'll shoot you. -Yadav, calm down. We won't harm you. Relax. Lower the gun. Listen to me. Don't worry. Relax. Lower the gun. Sir. Hey... 'Now you are going to die.' How dare you bring them here against my orders? -Sir, I am very sorry, but I thought-- -It's my job to think, Arjun. You work for me. And what are your thoughts, about the bullet fired from your gun? Do you have any miraculous ideas, to stop the inquiry against you? What inquiry? Everyone saw that he shot himself. We were there. The CBI will only focus on why they were here. Two people died in my lockup. First time in 12 years. You are suspended. -Send the body for post-mortem. -Sir... Sir, this is not Sinha sir's fault. He brought them here for their own safety. To keep them from harm's way. This is a different matter, sir. It's the winds, sir. Beyond our understanding. Judging by how he slit his throat, it wasn't him at all. He seemed possessed. 'He is restless.' 'When something is left unfinished,' 'they only tell those who are close to them.' 'Maybe he is trying to tell you something.' "Radhika." Hello, Divya. Radhika, I somehow managed to get the victim's footage before his death. I've mailed it to you. Check it once. Radhika. Radhika. Raghav. You are so careless. You can't fix an interview. I just need 15 minutes. Tell him. How long will it take? Fine, fix it for the day after tomorrow. 12:30. Okay, 12:30. Fifteen minutes. Yes, only 15 minutes. Monday... Confirm it for me, okay? 12:30. It's been four days already. Okay? Inform me. Bye. Radhika. Bro, what's wrong? What happened? Raghav. What? Raghav... Bro, there is nothing there. Nothing there. Are you alright? Nothing. Are you alright? Do you want something? Guys, someone get some water. Raghav is doing all this. Now it's my turn. I am going to die, Adi. I am going to die. Radhika, can you please tell me what's going on, so I can help you? He's here to take me, Adi. If I hadn't insisted on swapping seats that day, I would have died instead of him. I gave him my death. And now he's coming to give me his. I cannot tell you anything, but I am scared, Aadi. It's like everything I believed in, everything I stood for... All my instincts were wrong. There is a reason why you're not telling me things. And I respect that. But there is only one way to get over your fear. Look straight in the eye, and you scare it away. And we journalists should have data, research, facts, everything. But stories are based on instincts. And our instincts are never wrong. Radhika. Raghav. Are you alright? I am not angry with you. I am so sorry. It wasn't your fault. I am so sorry Raghav! Raghav! Are you out of your mind? Why did you take a U-turn? Because I wanted to know, what actually is happening to those who take a U-turn. What happened in the lockup the other night, I thought I was going to die too. So I started panicking. My biggest guilt is my brother. Started to haunt me. At one point, I was so terrified, I thought Raghav was doing all this. But then I realised it's all about this. And someone is taking advantage of it. Someone is making us believe it's a ghost. Just think about it. All those who took a U-turn, died within 24 hours. If this was a ghost, then how did I survive? Arjun, I have a pretty strong gut feeling, that the answer lies not at the U-turn, but in the accidents caused by it. That's the primary difference between you journalists and cops. You guys can base an entire story on just guts. But we need evidence. No evidence, no case. But we'll find evidence if we look in the right place-- I have had enough, Radhika. Listen. You know that I really respect your cause. I tried very hard to find it, but came up empty-handed. And this case is officially closed. And I really feel you should move on with your life. Please, Arjun, you can't abandon this now. I know even you don't believe these deaths are suicides. -If we could just-- -I am sorry. Sorry, I have to take this. Sorry. Yadav. Yeah. I can't come now. You know what, just text me. Who is she? Sarita Singh. June 10th, 2019. Her car hit the divider block and flipped over. Her accident was the most brutal of all. Instant death. She and her child. Child? Her five-year-old child fell from the flyover on the railway tracks below. No trace of her was found. Not even a part of her. And the police closed the case as rash driving. What happened? I don't have the information about this lady in my research. Risabh, I need this verified by evening, otherwise, I am screwed. What's up? There is a name missing in your reports? Sunita Singh? Can you check again, please? Okay. Although I sent you all the names. This must have happened more than a year ago. 10th June. It's been less than a year. Then it must not be too serious. Maybe that's why it's not been covered. It was huge. Can you check again, please? Okay. Give me time till evening. Any luck? Not yet. Nine accidents were reported before Deepak's death. Five of the families were completely wiped out. Two of them migrated. And only an 80-year-old handicapped guy survived the last one. We should get the address for Sunita's vehicle. Hello. I need the address for a vehicle. Give me the number. CH-01-UU-3707 Hello. Harry. Hello. Yes, hello. I will text you. Okay, thanks. Hello. This was our car. Dad sold it two years ago. Some guys don't get the ownership transferred. To escape the hassles of waiting in queues and paperwork. Basically, they avoid the hassle. The RTO finds out only when they fine them. There is no other way of keeping track. And that's the excuse for everything in India. Do you remember anything about the buyer? I was in Toronto. I've been living there for five years. And I lost my dad a few months ago, so I had to come back. I want Sunita Singh's hospital records. Find out who claimed her body. -Okay, sir. -I'll get it done, sir. Okay. Yadav, you go to the RTO. And get all the footage of the flyover. Okay, sir. And, Sodhi. I want copies of all the files. Yes, sir. What excuse did you give Saxena sir? Dhillon had a diabetes attack. His condition is critical. Are you out of your mind? What if I really suffer an attack? -Come on, get to work. -Let's go, Dhillon. Stop sipping the tea, or your diabetes will actually spike. Come on, let's go. -Keep me updated. -Yes, sir. -Jai Hind, sir. -Jai Hind, sir. -Jai Hind, sir. -Jai Hind. No one showed up to claim Sunita's body. There is no footage of the accident. No footage of anyone removing the blocks. Because CCTVs are only at the entry and exit points. But I found something in the other footage. Come. Here. Look at this. Every day between 9-9:30, and between 6-6:30 in the evening, Sunita's car passed the NTPC flyover. Office timings. So maybe she was a working woman. We should find out where she worked. We don't even have her residence address. How will we find her office? Okay, look. She drove in this direction every day. All the government offices and banks are in this sector. If we go to every office and ask whether they had an employee called Sunita Singh, then maybe-- There are at least 200 offices in this area. We'll need a month to cover all these offices. Yes, but someone somewhere must know Sunita Singh. So maybe we can find some answers. Maybe, but it's a pretty vague strategy, Radhika. It won't be easy finding the answers to our questions. You are right. But if the answers are out there, then we will find it. Listen, Divya. I needed a favour. Do you know anyone at LIC? This girl will slog us to death. She is less of a reporter and more of a detective. Thanks. -Sorry. I didn't see you. -Are you out of your mind? Sorry. Idiot. Are you blind? Wait here. I'll be right back. Sir, we searched the entire sector. We came up with only three Sunitas. Anand, Kumar, and the other Singh, who are still alive. No one knows anything about the deceased Sunita, nor is there any trace of her. We'll need more people. I think we'll have to scan the sectors. Sir, what do we hope to find if we scan the entire city? Nothing. Don't let this girl fool you, sir. She is definitely taking us for a ride. Yadav relax. Yadav sir. One question. Ask. Is it possible that a substance in the body, can't be detected in the blood. Are you watching some English films these days, madam? We have our forensic expert right here. Dhillon, answer Madam's question. I am no expert. But I was posted in the forensics department earlier. Madam, it can be detected. But it can only be confirmed after a certain level. Like detecting alcohol in a breath analyser. By the way, madam, we did a post-mortem on all the victims. But found nothing. And the viscera report? It can be detected in that, can't it? No one asks for it. Takes a couple of weeks to get it done. But we should get it done, sir. We should. Let's get it done. I'll tell the department to get it officially done. Drink your tea. Would you like anything to eat, madam? Sir, I have to go. Fine. I'll get it done, madam. Okay. I was coming to see you, Arjun. Radhika, it's Harry. Only Harry knew about the U-turns besides you. You survived that night, because Harry didn't have your bike's number. You were right. We missed such a minor point. We still are, Arjun. I found Sunita's husband. What? Arjun. Arjun? Dhillon. Yes. Inderjeet Singh Dhillon. Tag. And thus ends this game of hide-n-seek. You go to your house, to God. And I'll go to my-- But I don't have a house. A house is made of a family. One U-turn destroyed everything. Am I doing anything wrong? Am I? Asking for the viscera report. Why? Even my SHO never asked for it. Why do you want it? Digging deeper and deeper. Stopping at nothing. Now die. Fear drug. Yes. And its compound name is Fenacalidin. Also known as Blue Daisy. It's common for you. Why didn't you ever try this? Four drops and four hours. Darkness... height, crowd, suffocation... No matter how deep your fear is... Or any secrets you have been keeping, it brings everything out. Brings you face-to-face with the truth. Embraces the truth with a smile. And do you know what the truth is? Death. And now, madam journalist will embrace the truth. How did you give the fear drug to everyone? It's death. Those destined to die come face to face eventually. But since you want to know. Dhillon will fulfil your last wish. So let's start with Deepak. It was tea time. Deepak ordered 'Jalebi'. And I poured four drops on his Jalebi and added to his joy. And Sinha sir took those two bikers in his custody. For safety sake. I was worried. But then I remembered my wife's words... No matter what the tension, a cup of Dhillon's tea solves everything. But things got messy in the advocate's case. Neither you nor I had his number. The midget had it. So I personally... 'What is it now?' He was trying to be over-smart. One tight slap, and he dashed towards the balcony. Made my job easier. And I threw him over. He was one rude guy. Very rude. So the midget gave you all the numbers. You have brains. But you slipped up. You never asked for Sunita's full name. Nor Harry's. Ajit Singh Dhillon. Nickname Harry. -Your brother? -Yes. My younger brother. He's got a very helping nature. He helped you with your story, and he's still helping me. He's been keeping Sinha sir busy. "What?" You thought Harry was helping you. But actually, you were helping us. But it was easier for you. Being a cop, you could have found out, who was responsible for Sunita's accident. Madam, do you think I didn't try? It wasn't a hit-and-run case. Waste of time for the police. There were no cameras at the accident spot. So a waste of time for the RTO. No one in our country likes to waste time. Even if someone's dying. For three months, I stood on that flyover. Morning, noon, evening, and night. To find some clues and reopen my wife and child's case again. But found nothing. Then suddenly, I saw you one day. So there is no way to know if someone moves the block in those 500 meters. How is this possible? -I've been coming for three months-- -Who is the girl? She is like us, brother. Comes here every day, religiously. Everything was going smoothly. You were getting what you wanted, and I was getting what I wanted. But you messed up everything by bringing up Sunita's name. You left me with no option. When you die, madam, I will be genuinely sad. Do you think you can run? I told you don't run. This is where it comes to an end. Where do you think you can go now? If only you had the evening tea, you would have died peacefully. 'I will tell them officially. Finish your tea. It's getting cold.' You made me violent unnecessarily. Had it been anyone else, we could have formed a team together. Find all those who took a wrong U-turn and kill them. And you forgot about your pain, madam. You forgot all about your brother. Shame on you! Our methods were different, that's all. When I couldn't save Raghav, I decided no other Raghav will die. And when you couldn't save Sunita, you decided everyone will die like Sunita. Even if someone's waiting for them at home like you! You won't understand. You won't understand. You can never understand. You have to die. You shouldn't have drunk that evening tea, not me. I assumed it was someone around us. "Are you blind?" You made a mistake today evening. And you proved me right. Instincts are never wrong. And when the owner of Sunita's car sent me a text, it was all clear to me. Your name was on the car sale deed. Your crusade wasn't wrong, Dhillon, you are. Because one way or another, we will find those who wronged us. But it won't bring back Raghav or Sunita or your child. Papa. Join us. You also come. I won't look good. You two come together. I don't want to do it. I will fall. What if I had fallen? Silly girl. Nothing will happen to you when I am around. Come on. Let's go. Sunita. Sunita. Dhillon sir. Dhillon sir. Dhillon sir, stop. No! I can't believe this. Although from your voice, I knew something was wrong. Harry told me the rest. By the way, you are much more courageous than you look. What good did that do, Arjun? 10 lives were lost. But dozens more were saved. At least people won't fear any ghosts now. Let the myth be. Please. -By the way-- -Wait a second. I know her. Radhika. Are you okay? Radhika, I'll see you. Sure. Are you okay? Your instinct saved me. Otherwise, there's no saying what would have happened. I owe you one. Thanks. Then how about beer tomorrow night? I am okay to free float. You know, go with the flow. Too boring. Let's try 'he's my guy' as well. -Really sorry. I am sorry. I am sorry. -Ouch! I am sorry. I am sorry. Did you do all this? Are you hurt? Over here? I did. -Hey! -Hi. Listen, it's my first week at the office. You're coming to chill, right? I am really sorry, man. But I am too far out. Don't give me that attitude because you are cute. Okay. I am coming. I'll come. See you. "Our paths have separated." "Dreams have faded?" "The rains drenched me completely." "Dissipating like smoke." "Our paths have separated." "Dreams have faded?" "The rains drenched me completely." "Dissipating like smoke." "This journey of ours, " "came to a halt." "Leaving the skies far behind." "Lost. I feel lost." "Why is there no trace of you?" "Lost. I feel lost." "Why is there no trace of you?"
