KSS Presents Sho Aikawa A Visit From Fate You live here, honey? Your father's home, isn't he? Isn't he? Mom, there's a man outside. Still?! We should call the police! It was for the company! This can't get out! Where did you borrow the money from?! Who are you?! I'll call the police! The police? I'm just here on business, ma'am. There's someone at the door. Why don't you answer it? Ma'am?... oh, well... Goro! Don't make a sound! No. Put that away. That's all I have. I'm afraid that's not going to be enough. You should be shot. Michiko! Loser! Anyone upstairs? Can you keep quiet? Promise? Hey! There's no-one up here! The boy's safe! You OK? Come on... I kept quiet. I was afraid they'd kill me, too. Anjo! Do we really need all this, just for one speed freak? A lot of these guys now are right out of it. Just in case. You don't have your gun, as usual? You carried one in uniform. I hated it. We'd like to have a few words with you. - You OK? - Yeah. Anjo! You idiot! Don't. Don't. You OK? Hi. You hungry? Blood... you've got blood on your sleeve. I'll have these cleaned. Thanks. This looks good. Thanks. What happened? A guy shot himself. Right in front of me. A user. They're all crazy. People like that have guns? Yeah, these days. Anjo residence. Oh, hello. Yes, he just got back. I'll put him on. Mr. Hirasawa. Yeah? The autopsy report's in. And? That user had no fingerprints. What? They'd been burned off his fingertips. We have no idea who he is, or where he's from. The resident's-card data he filed is a pack of lies. So? They're running his picture on the computer downtown. At least some things get easier... What do you think? There was something going on. Speed freaks don't just burn off their fingerprints. A girl? I arrested her once, for speed. Oh, Maki... She was living with him. Maybe she fell out of love. Good morning! It's not morning. Will she be here soon? She didn't come in yesterday. She's not very reliable. Do you know her address? Akemi! Do you know Maki's address? Yes. Mr. Hirasawa, we have a match. So he did have a record... Ah, this guy... He was a hopeless case. Find someone to identify the corpse. Yes, sir. He's got no family. We found a guardian instead. 'A guardian'? A man who took him in when he got out of reformatory. The girl? She hasn't been back home. The guardian is here. I'm Miyaji. Thank you for coming. May I see him, please? There's no mistake. That's Tamotsu... poor kid. Thank you. I took him in, so I'd like to arrange for his funeral... if that's all right. Certainly! Thank you very much. Goodbye. What? Nothing. Karaoke Pub: Triangle Mr. Nagata! Look, Akemi! I haven't seen Maki lately. Where is she? I don't know. Has she got someone on the side again? Let me know if you hear from her, OK? I talked to the Rehabilitation Bureau. This Miyaji's quite a guy. He finds work for ex-prisoners, and even hires some himself. What does he do? He runs a laundry business. The president's one 'Tokie Miyaji'. His wife, I guess. Here's a lost of the people he's had on parole. Thanks. Member, Oishi Syndicate The Oishi gang... Mr. Anjo! Telephone! There's a call for you. From a woman. Maki? I don't know. Take the call. Anjo speaking. They're after Maki. Help her. Who is? The yakuza. But the Oishis run 'Triangle'. Why would they be after her? She was living with this guy who had no fingerprints. She said one day someone came over and told him... to kill someone. That guy didn't have fingerprints, either. Kill who? - Did you hear? - Yeah. That user was a hit man. Someone was running him. Might the victim have been that bank manager last year? Yeah, but the Oishis could've contracted the job out. Meaning? This is Maki. Get her into protective custody. Right away. Hey! I'll keep this. This way. My husband is waiting. Hello! Come in. You honour me. It embarrasses me now, but I was in trouble as a young man. Perhaps that's why now I understand how they feel. That's why I do this work of rehabilitation for them. I have several working here for me, even now. But there was no helping this young man. Had you heard anything of what he was doing? Since about three or four years ago... I hadn't heard a word. He'd kept in touch regularly before that. And this girl? I'm afraid I don't know her. I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help. You know a man called Nagata... Nagata? One of the main members of the Oishi Syndicate. Ah, there was someone here by that name. There've been so many... This poor soul didn't even have parents to come for his ashes... Get Tomoharu. We can't kill a cop. He'll be after us. What about the girl? Did you find her yet? No. She's first. Tokie! Tokie! I'll go home. - No, come with us. - Where? Where do you want to go? What are you doing?! Knock her out. Burned to a crisp, and the teeth knocked out. Maki? Maybe. There goes our only lead. Anjo... are you hiding anything from me? Do you think I'd leak something? No... I was just thinking about why I don't carry a gun. You mean the other day? It's not that I don't want to shoot someone... it's that I do. You're tired. Go home and relax. Why are you here? Hi. You're early. Yeah... is this when you usually get home? No. I'm early today, too. Shall I start dinner now? OK. No, wait... I'm going out for a bit. Will you be late? Yeah. 'Bye. Nagata... Hold it! He's a cop. You guys hit the bank manager last year, didn't you? They checked us out backwards and sideways on that. You're all over us with any excuse you get. You know Miyaji. No. Hey! Show me your hands. You've got fingerprints. Don't his killers burn theirs off? What are you babbling about? Move! Who's the guy with no fingerprints? Mr. Anjo, I wouldn't get too deep in this. Is that a threat? No. Give me something, or I'll start turning the screws. Fuck off! Don't. What do you want? Huh? You're under arrest for assault. On your feet! Let's go! Let them do what they want! Don't do anything! That's the third one of my men they've arrested! Miyaji's damn junkies fuck up... and the shit comes down on us! Smoke! Excuse me! That cop's a problem. You mean we should kill him? No. How would we settle this with the cops up our ass?! Find that damn girl right away. Phone. Yes, Mr. Oishi, I know, but... Not on the phone. Let's meet at the warehouse tomorrow. Shall I go? Would you? I can't move from here. - Because of him? - Right. You're too nice, that's your trouble. You fool! Who do you think I've done all this for?! You're a pest, you know, hanging around here. Who are you? I remember your parents. You had a sister, too. When I showed up, they looked at me like I was scum. You're looking for me? Too bad... you're too late. Sure! Do what you like! You're a cop! You got a kid yet? When you have, I will come and pay you a visit. What?! To what do I owe this? It was on the way. Are you finished work? No, I'm on a stakeout. Could you maybe stay at your parents' place for a while? Why? This case might take a while. I won't be able to get home. - And my job? - Take time off. I can't just up and do that! You can go from your parents' home. There was a threatening call from some creep last night. I knew this might happen when I married a cop. It's about 'that'... Isn't it? Yeah. I found them. Thanks for coming. Oh, it's you... Something came up. Like I said on the phone... we need someone of yours to take the fall. Then the cops will back off. We don't have young guys we can sacrifice. We're not yakuza. Then how do we end this? This is your fault. We're helping you find the girl. Nagata... you're on. This guy's a police informer. This is one of your guys, isn't it? I thought he was just some user! You said to give the cops something to leave us alone! You want him dead, you do it. Boss! Please! OK. OK. We'll give this guy to the cops. That may be all right for you, but not for us. We're under contract. We stick together till the end. You're looking for Maki, aren't you? I know where she is. She came to me to buy drugs. I had her followed. Where? I'll tell you! I'll tell you! If you're right, you'll walk. An apartment in Sakaicho... the Satomi-so. - That's the truth! - Get going! Getting her will help. Lucky guy! Sit down. I don't know what'd happen if you betrayed us. Here. Yeah? Anjo? We found Maki. Alive? The yakuza chased her to a police box. She's at headquarters now. Come over here, will you? I'm at Miyaji's office. Miyaji? The guardian? Yeah. I'll take responsibility. Tomoharu! Tomoharu! You're going to have trouble over this. We'll get the warrant later. We found the girl. She's alive. - Sis! - Come on! - Sis! - Sis! - Tomoharu! Tokie! There's work to do. I'll handle this now. Talk to us. That's the guy who came over, isn't it? Why did you come to us? If you aren't going to talk, out you go. Him, too. No! Then talk. I heard when we were living together. There were lots of them. They didn't know each other. Normal people, but they'd get phone calls to go kill people. Sure, you've caught him, but what about the rest? It's no good. She won't talk. We're screwed. Yeah? I'm not going to tell them anything! So help me! She's the girl's guarantor. Thank you for your help. Oh, thanks. You silly girl! You'll be fine. There's nothing to worry about. Really? I've talked to them. Thank you for everything. We've got nothing on him. Yes, sir. Mr. Anjo, your wife's on the phone. Thanks. Yeah? I think maybe I will go to my parents', after all. Yeah? Sorry. Take care. I will. I worry about you... OK, I'll call tonight. Don't worry. Don't! Where's sis? On a job. What's wrong? We've got to get out of that office. We can just change the name and start up again anywhere. Mr. Anjo? I found this on the road... It has some of your mail in it. Sorry... Thanks. Saeko! Saeko? Saeko, it's your father. Aren't you coming? Your mother's worried. Call if you've changed your plans. Message complete. Notice of resignation I need more bullets. All you got. Where's Saeko? Where's my wife? I don't know! I didn't give the order! So she's dead? I've never killed anyone! You know that! I never thought that would happen! We were just there to collect on a debt! I thought at least I'd save you! Save me? Yes! I saved you! I had a boy, too! He died! - 'Saved me'? - Lies! My brother never wanted to get his hands dirty! I do the dirty work! Your wife's dead. You want to know how I killed her? So? Are you going to get your hands dirty? Quick! Wait! Settle down, Detective! Stop it! Don't get excited! Calm down! Lend me your phone. Phone! Hirasawa? There's a body at Miyaji's office. The deceased... is my wife. You heard right. The Miyajis are finished. I've quit the force. I don't give a damn what you do now. So what do you want from me? If the police get the Miyajis, you're in trouble, too. You'd better finish them off, before that happens. I'm sure you agree. I'll make you a deal. I'll kill them. So you want us to hire you as a hit man? 'A deal', I said! You don't hire me. So, what's the deal? Tell me where they are. We don't know that. Then find them... before the cops do. Mr. Hirasawa! Mr. Anjo left his resignation in his apartment. Find him! Boss, Miyaji's office is crawling with cops! Yeah? Then get out and find them! Him or his kid brother, or his sister! You, too! Mr. Hirasawa's not here? OK, we'll settle with that bastard Oishi later. There's work... Get everybody and take the train up here. What do you think? We can work out of here for a while. What, kill Anjo?! We don't need more heat! We've got to kill him at the very least. Your damned impatience has ruined everything! Shit! If you'd just done things the way I told you! Do you know what I've gone through, fronting for you?! Do you?! The first mistake was yours... big brother. It's all yours. Who's he? Give him a try. I've trained him. Have you worked before? Yes, twice now. Just stay off the speed. Where are they? Miyaji's warehouse. He used to run drugs... but that was too much work, so he found a new business. Does it pay? They work for everyone, from political and religious groups... to old women who don't like their daughters-in-law. You can squeeze a lot of money out of people like that. Aren't you one of them? You must be kidding! I'm a straight-arrow yakuza. They aren't normal. You know what they do? They fuck each other. They're strange. That's it. You want me to come? I don't mind. I'm in this up to my neck already... Anjo! Drop the gun. It's not too late. Well, Mr. Anjo? What now? Hirasawa, get out of here. Don't be a fool! I'll shoot. - It's me! - Anjo! It's me! Nagata! Hirasawa... where's your vest? I didn't think you'd shoot... Hirasawa... Hirasawa! He's here. Hey! I hear that you fuck your sister! And that you're all crazy! No! It wasn't me! Ow! Where are the Miyajis? Tell me and I'll get help. Where are they? Talk! Here. Tokie! Tokie! But I saved your life! Yeah, you did. That was a mistake. Dying... all it is is some pain. Now I hurt real bad. That's all. See you. Shit! This should be shot! I burned everything. But I didn't get rid of the gun.
