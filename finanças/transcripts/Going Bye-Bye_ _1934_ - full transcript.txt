Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict? Yes, Your Honour. We, the jury, find the defendant... guilty as charged. Before I pass sentence... I wish to thank you two gentlemen on behalf of the State for the valuable evidence you have furnished this court in bringing this criminal to justice. It's men like you this country should be proud of. Order! The defendant will now stand up. Has the defendant anything to say on his own behalf? Nah. I hereby sentence you to prison for the rest of your natural life. Aren't you going to hang him? Order in the court! You dirty, double-crossing squealers. You rats! I'll get even with you... if it's the last thing I ever do. There ain't a jail in this country strong enough to hold me and when I do get out... I'll break off your legs and wrap 'em around your neck. I'll get you! You won't take me! I'll get you! I'll get you! Listen, fellas, if you take my advice, you'll get out of town as soon as possible. The Butch is like an elephant - he never forgets. Why don't you keep your mouth shut? What did I do? You put us right on the spot. Everything would have been all right if you hadn't said, "Aren't you gonna hang him?" Couldn't you see that he was annoyed? If he ever gets out of there, our lives won't be worth five cents. - Maybe we'd better get out of town. - How are we gonna get out of town? - We've got a car. - What are we gonna run it on? - On the road. - On the ro...! What are we gonna use for gas? We got enough money to buy some gas. Not enough to go as far as I wanna go. Say, that gives me an idea. Why don't we advertise for somebody to go with us? What do we want somebody to go with us for? Help drive and share expenses. Just like when we came out here, remember? At last you're using my brains. We'll go to the newspaper office and put in an ad... immediately. What are you doing in there? Never mind what I'm doing in here, help me get out. Quit that! Get behind me and pull me out. - Are you ready? - All right, go. Did you put the advertisement in the paper? - Yeah. And they printed it. - What does it say? - Shall I read it? - Certainly. Wait till I get me glasses. Won't take a minute. It serves you right. - No wonder I couldn't see through them. - Why? They're yours. I'll read it. "To whom it may concern... " To whom it may concern! That's so nobody else will read it. - "Two young gentlemen... " - That's us. - I'll read it. - All right, read it. "Come home, Nellie, all is forgiven... " "Two young gentlemen who are making a motor trip east would like for someone to drive and also pay expenses, "like when we came out here. "Phone Maine 489. "Sincerely yours, Mr Laurel and Mr Hardy. "P.S. Those not interested, do not answer. " - What do you think of it? - It's very nice. Brief and right to the point. Can I help you with anything? Pack up those cooking utensils. Don't take that. You know it doesn't belong to us. - What about the milk? - You better take that, we might need it. See who that is. Hello? Are you the party who advertised for a travelling companion? - Yes, ma'am. - Who is it? It's a lady about the trip. Just a minute. My friend Mr Hardy will speak to you. Hello? Er, excuse me, please, my ear is full of milk. Brush that off. Pardon the delay, please. What is the nature of your business? I understand you're driving east... and I'd like to go along. Well, that suits me fine. How soon do you expect to leave? Why, at your convenience, of course. Well, I'm ready to go right now... baby. Er, what is the address, please? Mm-hm. Well, I'll be right over. Goodbye. That's enough. Extra! Extra paper! Butch Long escapes! - Butch, what are you doing here? - I took a vacation. Why? You know they'll get you. I got an account to settle. - One of the gang double-cross you? - No. - Two mugs opened their traps too wide. - So what? I know how to shut 'em up. What are you gonna do, Butch? I'll search this town from end to end till I find 'em. But you can't stay here. This is the first place they'll look for you. That's them! Quick! Down the fire escape. No, they've probably got the place surrounded. Then hide in here. If the worst comes to the worst, shoot your way out. In the trunk. How do you do? We're the gentlemen you're going east with. - Won't you come in? - Thank you. Flowers for you. I'm Mr Hardy and... As I was saying, I'm Mr Hardy. This is my friend Mr Laurel. - How do you do? - Well, are we all ready to go? - I was... - You haven't changed your mind, have you? No. No, but you see a friend of mine just dropped in and he's awfully anxious to leave town. And, er, I was wondering if you could possibly make room for him? Oh, why, certainly! The more, the merrier. Oh, that's awfully nice of you. He'll be tickled to death. - Don't be long, we've got to get going. - What's your hurry? We got to get out of town as fast as we can. A fella told us that if he ever caught up with us he was gonna break off our legs and was gonna tie 'em around our necks. Didn't he? Hmm. Don't you worry. With my friend along, nobody would dare harm you. Oh, but you don't know this other fella. Oh, yeah? Well, you don't know my friend. If you just sit down, I'll have him come out and meet you. Sit down, Stanley. It's OK, Butch, you can come out. - Who was it? - Friends of mine. I want you to meet 'em. OK. Open the trunk. All right. Hurry up, I'm choking in here. - Butch! It's locked! - Well, unlock it. Well, I can't. I haven't got the key. Well, ain't that swell? You dumb cluck! Aw, take it easy. - Do you happen to have any keys? - Keys? My friend got locked in the trunk. - Locked in the trunk? - Well, he was packing and he fell in. It could happen. Maybe you could help me open it. Show us the trunk and we'll have it open in a jiffy. Right in here. Get me out! I can't breathe. Take it easy. My friends are gonna help you out. - It's locked. - Of course it's locked. That's why he can't get out. We'll have to break the lock, have you got a hammer? Sure. Here's some tools, help yourself. Just be a minute now. Hey! Cut that out. - Oh, Mae? - Yeah? Go and get Jerry, he'll open it. OK. Now don't go away, I'll be right back. Is there something we can do to help you? - Can we get you a sandwich or something? - Sandwich nothin'! There's no air in here! I'm chokin' to death. - It is hot, isn't it? - Sure is. - How's that? - How's what? That's no good. We'll have to bore some holes in the trunk. That's a good idea. - What? - We're gonna bore some holes in the trunk. Ow! What are you tryin' to do? - Why don't you be careful? - I didn't know his head was that end. Now put a hole in there. Wait a minute. - How was that? - Fine. Go ahead. - Are you getting any air? - It's getting better. Cut! Wait a minute, I'll do the next one. Say, what's the big idea? - Where's Butch? - Wouldn't you like to know? - Come on. - Where are you taking me?! - What is it? - Listen, fellas, I got an easier way to get me out of here. - What is your suggestion? - Get the blowtorch and melt the lock off. That's a good idea. Get the blowtorch. - Help me! Help! - What's happened? I'm on fire! Get some water and put it out. Hurry up! Quick! I'm burnin' up! Hurry! Hurry up! Help! Come on! Quick! Hurry up with that hose! I'm burning up! Oh! Stay with it, it won't be long now. Hurry up! I'm burnin' up. Is the fire out yet? - Yes! Turn off the hose! - OK, we'll turn it off. So... Well, here's another nice mess you've gotten me into. I couldn't help it! You told me I was using your brains...
