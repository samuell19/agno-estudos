I'll tell your dad. Don't! Takao, go ahead. Do her. You going to eat lunch? Give me a ride. Your lunch. Hey, shut up! Okay, okay. But not here. Any place's the same. Don't hurt me. That hurts! That hurts! Your first time, eh? It hurt, eh? You don't want me to do it, do you? Who cares? Just do as we planned. Only one lunch? I'm not a delivery woman. She brought you lunch? What's going on? It's obvious. She's fallen for you. - Think so? - Sure. It's true. Look. It's so cute. Don't tell anyone about this. Ouch! That was 3 months ago. She's been wondering which to pick. Don't go too far. You're jealous, aren't you? Remember whose daughter she is. You're an accomplice. You did it first. So you're worse. Doesn't matter. I'll get on a tuna boat. Oh, really. A woman! A woman, alone, is eating noodles She'll say no when she means yes You sound pretty confident. Hey, girl. How about a ride? You'll catch cold. Hurry. Take my hand. Where to? Don't know. Don't know? Any place'll do. Any place'll do? Sure. All right. Let me get out. Where to? Watch out. I'm getting out. Let me out. There's nothing here. - Stop the car. - Don't. - Stop. I'm getting out. - Watch out! It's got started. What's "it"? I don't want to dirty your truck. Oh, you mean, "it"! I hate the sight of blood. What luck! What a woman. Kick her out at the station. Maybe we won't have to work tomorrow. Got a plastic bag? This is all I have. You have a foot warmer. It's enough for us two. Don't touch. Your hands'll get dirty. Delicious! It's downstairs. The married couple are junkies. Been up all night? How could I sleep? But... I can't do it. Take a look. It'd tear my underwear. Sure. It looks real big. No! It's sealed. Just a little. No. Don't. Don't worry. It'll get into my womb. That's okay. I'm ashamed. I'm ashamed. That hurts. It'll get into my womb. That hurts. What? It's your tits. Your tits. I have kids. A 4-year-old and a 3-year-old. They're both boys. May I move close to you? What? What are you doing? I don't know why... But I'm getting cold. This string's still here. I've been grabbing it. You were the first to do like that. My prick's aching. I guess it's okay. Sorry. The string... Don't pull it. No! Damn this string! Ever tried heroin? Shoot it up here. It'll work. Heroin? Here? Have you tried it? I had a friend. She fell for a young man. She became a junky. She drowned in the sea. She had shots all over. She suffered in the water. Or the heroin made her high. Her toes were all bent... like this. What a story. You don't mind it getting red? No. Wait a minute. Your man a punk? Why? He was a junky, eh? Yes, he was a punk. But whenever I tried to leave him, he only threatened me. He couldn't even hit me. He was good for nothing. Look. It's got red. But it's not hard enough, eh? You do it so many times. Doesn't it hurt? It's slipping away. Do you do it so many times with your man too? Do you? Answer my question. Answer. Do you do it so many times with your husband too? Yes. Many times. It tastes like semen. You taste like that too. You have special drivers' licenses. You're ninja. Don't give your special skills away to other guys. Is it a rule not to teach laborers how to drive? You get paid more than other laborers because you have a license. Anyone else'd do, if he had a license. You only create competition for yourself that way. Want to be a mere laborer again? You call me a ninja and call yourself his boss? Don't you remember how kind I was to you? You got the license with my money. Don't talk so big! Kind? Can you call it "kind"? You make us slaves for a pittance! Be more reasonable, you two. You resort so quickly to violence. I despise you. Shut up. What about your school? Special monthly leave. Don't grin like that. You're like your mother. Don't be silly. You're taking it out on me. Shall I elope like her too? I'm her daughter. You'll only get ridiculed by the world. And I'll kill your boyfriend. You really an assemblyman? Boss, what about our work? It's this rain. Wait a little longer. That broad was strange. She didn't cry at all. She even moved her hips. Really? Ass! What kind of a virgin would do that? You got me there. Come to the parking lot. Me? Only me? No work today. No work for laborers, no work for us either. Seems yours is hard already. You came home so early. There's no work today. Isn't the rain coming in? I thought you wouldn't come home until evening. Are you hungry? I sure am. Looking out the window, I remembered there was a noodle shop over there. So I cooked noodles. They taste awful! Aren't you cold? It's cold. Let's go to bed. Let's. It's already wet. I woke up to find you were gone. I couldn't wait. I did it by myself. My tits ached. Your socks smell. Your underwear smells. I couldn't kill the lust. I did it by myself. If you didn't come home, I'd go back to someone else. That's what I thought. You ran away from him, eh? What did your husband do? I'll do the same. Don't you mind? The rain's coming in. Like this. Hurry up and do it. Like this. He taught you. He taught you everything. No. I'll do it. How many men have you had? Take responsibility. - Responsibility? - That's right. What do you want Kozo and me to do? Not the two of you. But we laid you together. I was a virgin. And you were the first. So I want you to take responsibility. What should I do? Don't say it's over! Does it hurt? It smarts. Wait in that tearoom. I can't stay pantyless forever. Got any money? A little. Take this. I won't be long. Wait there. You got jilted, eh? I want a drink. Will you give me 200 yen? Here. Don't do that. You're like a beggar. I told you. You're disgracing your family. I forgot the curtain rails. I remembered them on my way home. Never mind. I think I can hang it on nails. Did you buy a curtain? I bought a pan and a kettle too. What about panties? Shall I show you? These are yours. These'll dazzle you. Such small ones? Your hair'll show. Men are so naughty. They think about nothing but that. What's "that"? Don't ask me. You don't know? Shall I rub yours with my nose? Don't look at me. And cover your ears. Listen, I'm expecting. Didn't you know? No, I didn't. Who's the father? You are. Because you were my first man. It's obvious. Jesus! I'll have it. I will. We'll get out of this place. If we stay here, people will talk behind our backs. It's hard for you too. You bragging about your lunch? It's good. That shrew will make a good wife. - I'll quit. - Why? Whenever I'm laying her, I remember your dick. You're a nice couple. If it weren't for her father, things would be fine! What're you saying? I'm thinking of going to Osaka. I'm fed up with working with laborers. To do what in Osaka? I'll be a repairman. Listen, Kozo. Why not come with me? Repair work isn't for humans. You have to stay indoors all day. Why not work on a tuna boat? No, no. I don't like ships. I can't lay her if I'm on a ship. You really love her? You, show off! I'm sorry. I'll kill you. Come on out. Come on out! Come on out! Come on out, I said! Open up! Open the door! What's the big idea? I'll kill you! - I'm sorry! - Why don't you die? Who do you think you are? I'll kill you! Die, bitch! Let's go. I won't go anywhere. I'll stay with you. We're together. Understand? We'll stay together forever. It's you! You scared me. I thought someone came for me. This is my room. Who else comes? Who did you think I was? Whom did you want to come? Your husband? You bitch! I work. But you didn't even cook me dinner! You brought in another man! I don't need you any more. Get out! Wearing my underwear? Pervert! Get out! I was scared while you were out. I wished you were here. So I put them on. You pervert! Pervert! Pervert. At the supermarket over there, I bought lots of instant noodles. Want some? When you get paid next, we'll buy a new gas heater. Let me do it. It's hard to turn this one on. I'm a born bungler. Using this, I might get burned. I'm so careless... I might forget the gas is coming out. So what? We can die together. Silly. Everything's cheap at that supermarket. Eggs are a lot cheaper than at other places. Chocolates are 2 or 3 yen cheaper too. Just 2 or 3 yen? People around here don't know how cheap. Eggs are so cheap there... maybe because there's a chicken farm nearby. My bad luck started today when I wondered... if I should buy those eggs, and I didn't buy them. I should've bought some of them. Then these noodles would taste better. When I entered this room, somehow... it smelled of a woman. What smell? A woman's smell. It smelled like crackers. Then it was your smell. This room hadn't smelled like that before. A single man has a smell particular to him. Yours has been fading. You used to smell more strongly. How do you know? I may look like this, but I'm no fool. When I first came here, I thought this room had a strong smell. I've been wondering what it could be. I didn't know. You might not. Someone who hugged you might know it. The rain's stopped. I'll go with you. I'll go. Can't you wait? I'll earn money and come back. I'll talk to your father and marry you. Just wait until then. No. I'll go with you. See? My tits are itching. My milk will come out. It won't. Look. It'll come out. It'll come out. It itches. - It'll come out. - It won't. It'll come out. It will. What? The woman downstairs is yelling like a pig. Maybe your yells sound like that too. Do I yell like that too? Awful, isn't it? Awful. How awful. Why? It proves that you're alive, doesn't it? Listen... Make me yell like a pig too. Is this nice? Yes. I don't want to go. I haven't seen my sister lately. Come with me. I don't want to see strangers. I was a stranger too. So, you live together? I think I saw her somewhere. I've been thinking so too. Didn't you used to live in a hot spring town? I don't think so. It's deep in the mountains. We went there to sell draperies. I think you came to see my goods. No, I didn't. I've got to take a leak. Go that way. She dumb? What a shame. Maybe I was wrong. We go everywhere to sell draperies. We run into many things. Don't we? Maybe it's the case with Kozo too. She's right. I can't drive, so... I just sit by her side. I tell her I'm beginning to feel like doing it. She only says to behave. But when she feels like it, she's selfish. When we drive by a motel, she tells me that she's going in. She never waits for my answer. Let's go in. I'd laid another woman. So, I went in first to see if she'd left a kiss mark on me. What a big bathtub! This mat was in the explanation. What explanation? "Foam dance." Why are you so upset? You flirted yesterday, didn't you? I'll be hard on you. Get ready. I had no kiss mark. I waited for her in bed. She never came out. I peeked in. What a stupid sight.! Don't stare at me. Come and help me foam-dance. You know how to do it. Hurry up. Usually I let whores do it for me, so... I had to postpone my sales until the next day. Didn't you come see my draperies? She looked like you. Did she have red hair? I don't remember well. Don't worry. We won't dig up your past. Kozo isn't a decent man either. Take it easy. I don't care whatever you did. I'll tell you everything. Where I was, what I did. I'll make you jealous. Shut up! That's enough. I'm fed up with this rain. If you have a nice pussy, that's enough for me. Is mine that nice? Sure is. Men trained me. They taught me everything. That's enough. Please. Ass! No. I'm sweating. You stink. Come here. Here, this will do. No. Does it feel good? Do it right. Put my legs on your shoulders. What's wrong? You thirsty? I'll give you some water. Here. Drink some. Drink it. What does it taste like? Crackers. Crackers, eh? No. How's this? Is this nice? Nice, huh? No. Do it right. Put my legs on your shoulders. Like this? Is this so nice? You look scary. Somehow you look scary. Why do you like this position so much? Can't you forget your man who taught you this? Is that it, huh? Your kids sucked your tits. So did your man. How is this? I saw you walking together with the woman with red hair. Why didn't you tell me? She lives with me like a dog. She did it during her period. She's a sex maniac. Did she raise her legs and take any position? Was it an incredible turn-on? Can I fuck her this evening? No, you can't. Come on! You're mean. Don't tell me you've fallen for her. You couldn't have. She's just a dog. What if she's a dog? I can't fuck her because you love her? Do you love her that much? What're you saying? Ass! Knock it off! What? What've you been up to? It could be your kid! You might be the father! What? You could have a kid. Don't blame me! What's that? All right. All right. Come this evening. This new gas heater is nice. It doesn't scare me. I can use it anytime. It looks like the room's brighter. If we had a TV set, we'd look like newlyweds. I don't want it. There's something better. You mean this? Wait until I finish cooking. Be a dog. Don't. Watch out. I have a knife. Don't. Be a dog. Is this nice? Nice, huh? Is this nice? It'll be even nicer. Who are you? No! No! Good luck. Wait! No! If you do this, I'm going home. She says no at first. If you do this, I'm going home. My husband'd be better. He's been looking for me. He's nicer. He does everything for me though he might kill me this time. He'll be jealous. Do it softly. Do it softly. Buy me a drink. Got 200 yen? Is it hard? You want to fuck? Haruko! Haruko! Do it softly... Hey. 200 yen isn't enough. No, no. You're mistaken. Let's go upstairs. I'm here to drink. Don't pretend. I know yours is hard. It's not for you. My woman's with another man. That makes me horny. Silly. Dicks are so unreasonable. They can do it with any woman, right? Don't do that. I'll try yours. Stop it. You sell your woman and drink. What a man! Stop it! I'm making money for you. No. You won't do. I'll make you come. You can't make me. I won't come. You came, huh? Men are the all same. Any woman will do. Are you jealous again? Stupid! Get away! Lecher! See? He's crying. Gross! Not a cow, yet it produces milk How strange a dick is Not rubber, yet it stretches and shrinks How strange a dick is It gets angry when I love it How strange a dick is It's willing even when I am not How strange a dick is Pervert. I've been to the public bath. Why don't you go too? It'll refresh you. Yours was bigger. Just forget it. How can I? Don't you know how I feel? He said he'd elope with his girl. It's nice to be young. How nice to be young. It's nice to be young. Being young is nice, eh? How nice! It looks red. Let's keep doing this all day. It's getting hard. I can't forget you after all. I felt like someone was shooting me. My toes all bent. I felt that nice. It's raining. We can do this again today. Though the rain won't keep falling forever.
