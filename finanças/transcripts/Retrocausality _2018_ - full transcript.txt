- [Narrator] Causality, noun. The relationship between cause and effect. The principle that everything has a cause. Retrocausality, noun.

Most of them, completely insignificant. But on the 31st of January, Max meets someone who isn't. (gentle music) (train bell rings) This is not a love story. In fact, it's the opposite. (train rumbles) (mysterious music) I must do everything I can so they don't speak to each other. - Holy. (easygoing music) Shit. I mean, she's different. I'm crazy, right? I'm good right now, I think. I don't wanna mess with anything. Plus, I'll probably never see her again. You know I'd do anything to make you happy, right? (inquisitive music) (people chattering) - [Narrator] This is the moment when everything changes. Max, from a small town in Quebec, that would be Canada, recently turned down a full ride from Cornell. Oh, I see is quite possibly the most beautiful girl in the world. Max, for some reason, is the kind of girl who could fall in love with a stranger. You may recognize Scott from last summer's blockbuster hit or how he mysteriously disappeared right after. Scott does not believe in love. His longest relationship lasted a month. With two girls at the same time. (easygoing music) (dog barking) He will avoid any situation with a potential other. Damage. - I love guys with (mumbles). (bell rings) (intense music) (dog barking) (kids breathing heavily) - [Child] Jordan, I found him. - This went on for-- - We're going to beat you up. - A few years. Five years, to be exact. - Okay. Yeah, I understand. No, no, no, he normally is a very sweet boy. Yes, I understand, okay. I'll speak to him. Bye, now. (mysterious music) - [Woman] Hola. (woman muttering) - Ma? - Sylvie! - How do you know when you like someone? - [Woman] Can't you do something (mumbles). - Like, like, like a girl? How do you know when you like a girl? - [Woman] Sylvie, I'm getting a divorce. - [Woman] What? - You just know, honey, you just know. - Do you think I'd look cooler with his hair? - Your hair is perfect just the way it is. Does this have something to do with what happened at school today? - (sighs) No, Mom. (woman muttering) (door thuds) (Tony sighs) - [Woman] Look, I admit I came to Cara's to escape the murder, eventually. But that doesn't mean I'm ready for French traditional. - [Woman] I loathe the whole idea of divorce. - [Woman] Really? - [Woman] If only Charles had been honest with me. That's all I ask of anybody, the simple truth. - [Woman] But with Charles, everything is secrecy and lies. He's hiding something from-- (door thuds) Something terrible and it frightens me. - [Man] Does he belong to you? - [Woman] It's her, where'd you find him, robbing a bank? - [Man] He was throwing snowballs at Van Ross' child. - [Woman] Oh, thank you. - [Man] Do we know each other? - [Woman] Why, do you think we're going to? - [Man] I don't know, how can I know? - [Woman] Because I already know an awful lot of people and until one of them dies, I couldn't possibly need anyone else. - [Narrator] Scott swore he was never coming back. (crickets chirping) - I'm sorry, Mama. I love you. - I love you too. Hey. How'd you like if we dye your hair blonde this weekend? Yep? (gentle music) When I was your age, my parents used to tell me stories. Magical stories. One, in particular, stuck with me. Have you ever heard the story of Bertie? - [Scott] No, who's Bertie? - [Mom] Bertie is an old folk tale about a girl who was able to travel in time because she knew how to fold it. - Okay. - Bertie was young and beautiful and she was in love with this young boy named Cricket. Everyday after school, she would make origami for him. Do you know what origami is? - [Scott] No, is it spicy? - (laughs) No, let me show you. I actually have one here in my wallet. It's a crane, it's like a bird, see? It's for you, keep it. So, Bertie was waiting for the perfect time to deliver it all to Cricket. When that day finally arrived, she overheard Cricket say he liked another girl. So Bertie cried and cried for days and eventually she went on with her life but she never loved again or was happy and it wasn't until 10 years later that she decided to deliver the origami. So, she put everything in a box and went to Cricket's house but when she arrived, she realized that something happened to Cricket. - [Scott] What happened? - Well, he was gone. Bertie went inside and she saw a box full of cranes with a note that said for Bertie, the girl I loved but it was too late. Bertie still lives in that same town and lives that day over and over again. - Couldn't she go back in time? - She can travel back in time but there's nothing she can change. - [Scott] But there must be something that she could do. - Well, she can still change the present because even if you have the power to go back in time, you can't change anything. Okay, now let me ask you a question. What do you think Bertie should do? Simple, you go and say, "Um, hey, "I just wanted to say I think you're beautiful." - [Scott] I can't say all that. - There's nothing else you have to say. It will work its magic, I promise. Go. - [Narrator] Basically, she was wrong. They just made fun of his hair. The rest is buried too deep. You're still the same kid, Scott. One thing we can learn here is that just because you've made it, you never truly changed. - Uh... - [Narrator] Good job. It had been two years and 24 days from when Scott visited last. Also keep in mind, she's had a few lorazepam and a little too much of everything. - [Mom] Oh, my god, Scott. You're here. How are you? - I'm okay, don't worry about me, I'm okay. How are you? - Scott. - [Scott] Mm-hm. - We don't... We don't have too long. - [Scott] What do you mean? (mom coughs) What do you mean? - I need you. I need you to do something for me, please. - [Scott] Okay. - [Narrator] Don't listen to her, Scott, she's delirious. - There's this girl, she's around 5'8", has very, very long hair and brown eyes. She was just here a few moments ago. - Why, why, what do you need from her? What? - Just bring her here. Just bring her, go get her, I need to talk to her. - I just want to stay with you for a bit. Is that okay with you? (mom cries) - You're here. Scott. I'm very happy that you're here. - [Scott] I'm happy too. - And you can stay as long as you want but I need you-- - I don't know, I, I can't-- - To promise. - No, no. - No. - Look at me. Promise that you will get her (coughs). Say it. - Okay, I'll do it. - [Mom] Say you promise. - I promise, I promise. (knocking on door) - [Narrator] The doctor. - Nice to finally meet the great Scott. - Is quite possibly the worst human alive. (beeping) - [Woman] Paging Dr. Bentor. - No one's leaving or coming in until morning. (announcer mumbles) Your mom's not gonna live forever, you know. - [Narrator] He is right, though. Scott's mom, unfortunately, isn't going to make it through the night. (gentle music) (mischievous music) - [Woman] Oh my gosh, is that Scott Blue? I need a pic. - [Woman] I'm too scared. - [Woman] Ask him for it. - [Woman] I loved his last movie. - [Woman] His last movie sucked. (car horn honks) - [Woman] I heard he was shooting. He is so cute. Scott! Scott! Scott! - [Narrator] Scott's only ever had one real connection but more on that later. - Scott? Scott? Wait a minute, just wait a minute. Scott. Scott? Scott? Scott. Scott! (intense music) Scott! Scott! Scott. (breathes heavily) Why'd you run? Sorry. - It's okay. - Not for that, there's something I have to tell you. Scott... I need to... Well, um, what I did back then, it was... We were just kids. - [Narrator] Scott knew exactly who this bitch was. (playful music) - Harley? - Why are you trying to cover it all up? Just 'cause you're some big shot now? - Is that all? - [Narrator] What we didn't know-- - I'm sorry. - Was how they (narrator mumbles) - Please forgive me. - [Narrator] Beat him up every single day like clockwork. He almost forgot about it. - Honestly, I don't remember you. - Almost. - Um... Maybe you changed your hair or something? - [Narrator] Some things, you just can't control. (phone ringing) Max is great and Scott is not a bad guy. All I'm saying is they're not a match. (gentle music) - [Mom] Oh, you're back. - What happened? What happened? - [Mom] Did you find her? Is she outside? Scott. - Yeah? - [Mom] Is she outside? - No, she's not, she's not outside. - Scott. I just wanna see you happy. (people chattering) (beeping) (intercom mumbles) - Could be any minute. Hey. If you leave again, I'm not letting you back in. (beeping) (intercom mumbles) - [Narrator] Scott, stay, Max has a ticket to leave in the morning. You'll never see her again. Before we proceed, it's time to answer the burning question. Why does this matter? On any other day, anywhere else, with anyone else, it wouldn't. But today, today was an exception. It has to do with causation. An action leads to another. Because of this, therefore that. Sometimes with the strange properties of time, the outcome can be most unexpected. Does that make sense? Okay, there are two possible situations in this story. In one, they speak. In the other, they don't. If he picks the wrong one, okay, we'll indulge Scott for a little bit. Let's see what happens if they do speak first. (train rumbling) - You going on? You okay? 'Kay, let me go grab you a cab? Let's get out of this damn station. Wanna type it in? What's wrong? You in trouble? Am I just following her? Do I know her? I shouldn't let her walk alone. Should I say something? (gentle music) - [Max] If we'd never spoken, would everything be different? - [Narrator] Time to list some reasons for why Scott isn't right for Max. You're not ready. You'll have to give up on everything you worked so hard for. You'll regret it. And... Time. - [Woman] I can't believe it. (Max laughs) - Seriously, if things were different, I'd be laying down, looking back at that moment, killing myself for not saying anything. - [Woman] Pull out your phone. (mischievous music) - [Narrator] And after that, well, let's just not go there. It just wouldn't work. Trust me on that. It's just not meant to be. Scott thinks that was a daydream. We're back in reality and he cannot escape what is about to happen next. - What are you doing? If I had one more second with my mom, I'd give anything for that. You can do this. Yeah There you go. - [Narrator] Okay, here's another secret. Max has only one real connection in the past. Too bad he had to ruin it. (gentle music) - Why are you crying? Here. - [Narrator] I'm sorry we don't have more about her. But this isn't Max's story after all. All we need to know is that she's in the same place, the same day, at the same time. All Max is is a coincidence. (horn honking) (mischievous music) Max is too good for Scott. What is she thinking? What Max doesn't know is that she has just tested positive for a new virus called covid-19. (beeping) - [Woman] Paging Dr. Becker. Paging Dr. Becker, please. - Max, I'm ready for you. (beeping) - [Woman] Paging Dr. Statman. - Max. - Statman, please. - We don't have a lot of time. First of all, I'd like to say that you're a beautiful person. So, I mean, do you have dreams, goals, what are your goals and dreams? Did you lose your voice? Okay. So you want me to just cut to the chase? Can I tell you a story, really quick, I promise. Did you know I have a daughter. Lila, she's eight, I love her so much. I had her right around the time I started my career and all I wanted to do was be the dad that she could be proud of. Well, I got a job offer, right around the time she got sick. It was, it was across the country and um, I wanted the money to treat whatever it was she had. So I took it. Well... When it was worst than they thought, I decided to stay and when they gave us a year, I decided to stay. When she died and my wife needed me. - [Max] I'm so sorry. - Oh, Max. There's nothing I can do. Now, you, you know your options. Why don't you take a couple of days, think it over. There's still time. - I'm, I'm sorry, I've decided. (mischievous music) - [Woman] All nurses to the nurses' station. - [Narrator] If Max was smart, she would get on the train and leave. Scott has seen enough. I don't think we have to list any other reasons but we will anyways. She's too smart for you. She's too nice for you and most of all she's-- - [Scott] Who even are you? - [Narrator] Actually, you can try. - [Scott] She wants you to say something. - [Narrator] I'll let you try and see how this all blows up. Let me remind you. - Thing is, well, it's my father. I haven't seen him for quite some time. - Ma? - [Mom] Yeah? - Where's Dad? - Your father was taken away by angels. - Is he an angel? - [Mom] No. - Is he real? - Your father loved you more than anything, Scott. - [Narrator] Scott's dad left because he didn't want him. - [Scott] You don't know me. - [Narrator] Everyone leaves Scott. He's not good enough and never will be. - [Scott] Say that to my face. - [Narrator] If that's not good enough, let me show you something. Time for the big reveal. This, in fact, is real. (gentle music) April 26th. - [Woman] I think I, I think I love you. (rustling) (mischievous music) - [Narrator] It's just not meant to be. This is the moment when everything changes. Max, from a small town in Quebec, that would be Canada, recently turned down a full ride from Cornell. Oh, I see is quite possibly the most beautiful girl in the world. You've never loved anyone. What happened to the playboy, never get close to anyone Scott? Tell me how you could possibly love a stranger? I just want what's best. I don't want you to get hurt. - Hello? (patient coughing) - No one's ever loved you except for mom and she's gonna die and if you're thinking about Max right now, then maybe you do deserve this. Yeah. You don't want this. She'll hurt you. - What do you mean? - [Narrator] This is what happens. I'm you if you talk to her. (gentle music) You're my second chance. Live a different life, a better life. If you talk to her, I'll die. But you'll be... Me. They lied. It's not better to have loved than to have loved and lost. It's BS. You'll live this life. It's not worth it. (beeping) - [Scott] I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. I couldn't do it. - [Mom] Keep it. Scott. It's (mumbles). There's nothing else you have to say. It will work its magic, I promise. (machine ringing) (people chattering) - [Man] Did you say I'm dumb? Did you say I'm dumb? (beeping) - [Scott] Hey. - Don't. - I just wanted to say. (Scott sighs) (mischievous music) - [Narrator] It's not worth it. This, in fact, is real. You're my second chance. Live a different life, a better life. (Scott breathes heavily) Don't! - [Scott] I think you're beautiful. - [Mom] It will work its magic, I promise. (mysterious music) - You're the only one I'll ever love. I'll love you forever. I'd be laying down, looking back at that moment, killing myself for not saying anything. (train rumbles) (train bell rings) Are you going on? (gentle music)
