HERE IT COMES! HONK HONK! 3-D COMING AT YOU. I REALLY ADMIRE YOUR SHOES. I LOVE YOUR SHOES. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I WAS JUST THINKING, AS MUCH AS I REALLY ADMIRE YOUR SHOES AND WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A PAIR, I REALLY WOULDN'T WANT TO BE IN YOUR SHOES AT THIS PARTICULAR TIME AND PLACE. OW! HWUH! HWUH! I DON'T REALLY KNOW KARATE. I DIDN'T THINK SO. OW! YEOW! DAMN IT! GET UP! SON OF A... GET PISSED, RICH! I AM PISSED! OH! 15-LOVE. OK, COME ON! COME ON! COME ON! OK. YOU WANT TROUBLE, YOU'LL GET TROUBLE. OW, BLOOD! FAULT! ET LA. UH! THAT'S THE WAY YOU WANT TO PLAY... YOU BROKE MY NOSE. AAH! OLE! HAD ENOUGH YET? 30-LOVE. SURPRISE. 40-LOVE. HA!

WHAT'S THIS STUFF ON IT, VITALIS? NO, IT'S BLOOD. WHERE'S MY TEA? BERNIE! WANT TO TELL ME ABOUT IT? YOU'RE TOO YOUNG. COME HERE, GROVER. COME HERE, GROVER. GROVER. GROVER, COME HERE. SHIT! DAMN IT! THERE BETTER BE A WINDOW OPEN, GROVER. I'M GOING TO HAVE YOU NEUTERED. DON'T GO ANYWHERE, GROVER. I'M GOING TO THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE. AAH! AAH! GOD! OH, NO! GOD! OH, BROTHER, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. BOMP, BOMP, BOMP. YAY! [WHISTLES] MORE, MORE. THANK YOU. GOD DAMN IT! WE'RE SUPPOSED TO PUT THEM OUT! GUYS, GUYS. OH, WHAT NOW? OH, NO! WHAT'S GOING ON? I HAVE A DREAM. IT'S JUST A LITTLE DREAM. MY DREAM... I HOPE YOU DON'T FIND THIS TOO CRAZY... IS I'D LIKE THE PEOPLE OF THIS COMMUNITY TO FEEL THAT IF, GOD FORBID, THERE WERE A FIRE, CALLING THE FIRE DEPARTMENT WOULD ACTUALLY BE A WISE THING. YOU CAN'T HAVE PEOPLE WITH THEIR HOUSES BURNING SAY, "WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T CALL THE FIRE DEPARTMENT." THAT WOULD BE BAD. [KNOCK ON DOOR] CLEAN IT UP. DON'T MAKE ME HAVE TO EXPLAIN IT. NO PROBLEM, CHIEF. HELLO. HELLO? UH, I'M LOCKED OUT OF MY HOUSE. I CAN GET YOU BACK IN. COME ON INSIDE. I'LL GET SOME TOOLS. I DON'T HAVE ANY CLOTHES ON. YOU WANT A COAT OR ANYTHING? NO. I REALLY LIKE STANDING NAKED IN THIS BUSH IN THE FREEZING COLD. I'LL GET THE TOOLS. THANKS. WHAT IS IT? SOMEBODY LOCKED OUT OF THEIR HOUSE. NEED ANY HELP, CHIEF? LOOKS PRETTY BORING. I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT. NOBODY HAD A COAT? YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T WANT ONE. I WAS BEING IRONIC. OH, IRONY! WE DON'T GET THAT HERE. PEOPLE SKI TOPLESS HERE WHILE SMOKING DOPE, SO IRONY ISN'T A HIGH PRIORITY. WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY IRONY SINCE '83, WHEN I WAS THE ONLY PRACTITIONER OF IT, AND I STOPPED BECAUSE I WAS TIRED OF BEING STARED AT. YOU SHOULDN'T LEAVE YOUR LIGHTS ON WHEN YOU'RE LOCKED OUT. YOU WASTE LOTS OF ELECTRICITY. HIDE IN THAT BUSH, AND I WON'T SEE YOUR NAKEDNESS. YOU DON'T HAVE TATTOOS. THAT'S A WISE CHOICE. JACKIE ONASSIS WOULDN'T HAVE GONE AS FAR WITH AN ANCHOR ON HER ARM. EVERY JOB HAS A PERFECT TOOL. LET'S SEE... THIS LOCK DOESN'T ACCEPT MASTERCHARGE. I'LL TRY OLD RELIABLE. WHEN I SAY OLD RELIABLE, I'M LYING, BECAUSE I'VE NEVER TRIED THIS BEFORE. YOU MAY NOT WANT TO WATCH THIS. OK. [HUMMING] CAREFUL. GOD, I HATE HEIGHTS. [CRASH] WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I'M FREEZING. FOR GOD'S SAKE, PUT SOMETHING ON. THANKS. HELLO! THERE YOU GO. I'M AVERTING MY EYES... FINALLY. MEOW! LOOK WHAT YOU GOT ME INTO, GROVER. THANKS. DO YOU WANT TO COME IN... I, UH, SORT OF ALREADY DID. I FIGURED YOU WERE STARVING, SO I MADE SOME CHEESE AND VEGETABLES, AU NATUREL. MAYBE YOU'D LIKE SOME WINE WITH YOUR NOSE. [BANG] CHEESE. WINE WILL BE FINE. DO YOU HAVE A STRAW? NO, I DON'T, ACTUALLY. WHY? NO PARTICULAR REASON. CHEERS. [INHALING] PARTY TRICK. A NOSE BY ANY OTHER NAME. WOULD SMELL AS SWEET. MY NAME'S C.D. BALES. I'M THE FIRE CHIEF. YOU CAN CALL ME CHARLIE. MY NAME'S ROXANNE. THANKS FOR HELPING ME BEFORE. I KNOW THE LADY WHO OWNS THIS HOUSE. DIXIE? I LIKED HER. GAVE ME A GOOD DEAL FOR THE SUMMER. THIS HOUSE HAS A GREAT SPOT FOR THAT. I THOUGHT YOU'D NEVER ASK. I DIDN'T. IS IT THE MUMMY? OH, IT'S A TELESCOPE. IT'S BEAUTIFUL. YOU MUST KNOW ABOUT M-31. YEAH. I LIKE WHEN THEY GIVE ASTRONOMICAL OBJECTS NAMES, LIKE ANDROMEDA AND SATURN AND SEA OF TRANQUILLITY. THIS WHOLE NUMBERING THING IS TOO BORING FOR US CIVILIANS. DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY OBJECTS ARE UP THERE? WELL, I KNOW IT'S, UH, OVER 50. I THINK THEY'VE DONE PRETTY WELL CONSIDERING HOW MANY THINGS THEY HAVE TO NAME. HOW ABOUT MUON? GLUON? QUARK? YOU KNOW WHAT A QUARK IS? I USED TO. I JUST FORGOT. WELL, WE DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING, DO WE? SIT DOWN. I'LL SHOW YOU. LET'S SEE. HERE IT IS. NO ONE'S ACTUALLY EVER SEEN A QUARK, BUT WE KNOW THEY EXIST. THERE'S AT LEAST SIX DIFFERENT TYPES. THERE'S UP, DOWN, STRANGE, CHARMED, BOTTOM, AND TOP. THAT'S THEIR FLAVOR. THE TOP AND BOTTOM QUARKS ARE THE MOST COMMON KINDS, BUT ONLY AN UNUSUALLY EXOTIC COLLISION CAN PRODUCE THE STRANGE AND CHARMED QUARKS. IT'S BEAUTIFUL, DON'T YOU THINK? OH, YEAH. THESE ARE ASTRONOMICAL OBJECTS, THEN. NO, SUBNUCLEAR PARTICLES. OH. I THOUGHT SO. SO WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR? I CAN'T TELL YOU. WHY IS THAT? I CAN'T. IT'S A SECRET. I GOT A FEW SECRETS MYSELF, SOME PRETTY IMPORTANT ONES, TOO. ACTUALLY, I HAVE ONE LOUSY ONE. ACTUALLY, I DON'T HAVE ANY AT ALL. IT'S JUST SO DEPRESSING. DID YOU SAY YOUR NAME WAS ROXANNE? YEAH. IT'S UNUSUAL. IT'S PRETTY. THERE'S A NAME FOR A GALAXY. SORRY. DIDN'T MEAN TO WAX RHAPSODIC. I SHOULD GO. I'VE GOT IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO. OK. WELL, WISH ME LUCK. ON? JUST LUCK. NAH, I DON'T BELIEVE IN LUCK. WISH FOR... SOMETHING TO HAPPEN. I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN. GOOD-BYE. SO LONG. UH! ARE YOU OK? I'M FINE. BYE. SO LONG. BYE. ROXANNE. IT'S A PARTY TOWN, MAESTRO. YOU'LL LOVE IT. GAVANNA SAMANA? WHAT? WEREN'T YOU PLAYMATE OF THE MONTH, JUNE '85? NO. I THOUGHT I RECOGNIZED YOUR INNER DIAMETER SLOPE. WHAT'S THAT? THE PART OF YOUR LEG THAT CURVES INTO YOUR THIGH. WORKS EVERY TIME, MAESTRO. I'M CALLING YOU MAESTRO BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE WITH CHICKS. LET'S GO. I'LL TAKE THE TOP ONE. YOU READY? OK. RIGHT. WHAT? WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? TRAINING.

I'LL HAVE TROUBLE GETTING MY TELESCOPE UP THOSE STAIRS. I'LL HAVE C.D. DO IT IF HE'S NOT READING ENCYCLOPEDIAS. HE READS ENCYCLOPEDIAS? HE IS AN ENCYCLOPEDIA. HE'S FUNNY. HE'S MY GODBROTHER. THIS UNIFORM WORKS. THAT'S WHY I'M A VOLUNTEER. I CAN TELL. WHAT ABOUT YOUR BOYFRIEND? WHAT'S HIS NAME? RICHARD. WHEN'S HE COMING? HE'S NOT. HE'S NOT COMING. WHAT HAPPENED? WE JUST RAN OUT OF GAS. I GUESS I MISTOOK SEX FOR LOVE. I DID THAT ONCE. IT WAS GREAT. SANDY'S A VERY DEEP PERSON. OH, MY GOD, WHO IS THAT? SHE COULD CERTAINLY MAKE MY NIGHT. WHO IS SHE? OH, GOD. SANDY, COME HERE. WHO'S THAT? THAT'S ROXANNE. SHE STUDIES ASTRONOMY OR ASTROLOGY OR SOMETHING. THERE'S A DIFFERENCE? LOOK. SOMEONE IS CHECKING YOU OUT. NOW, HE COULD CHEER YOU UP. IF I WAS YOU, I'D DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT. MAYBE. MAYBE LATER. MAYBE NOT. YOU ARE PLAYING IT BEAUTIFULLY. DO YOU MIND IF I GIVE IT A SHOT? YOU GO RIGHT AHEAD. THANKS, MAESTRO. HI. HI. HI. I'D LIKE TO INVITE YOU TO A NELSON TRADITION OF HOT-TUBBING. PARDON ME? IT'S A TRADITION TO CONSUME WINE AND ENJOY SOME OUTDOOR HOT-TUBBING. TRADITION. WHEN THE SETTLERS CAME HERE 100 YEARS AGO, THEY STARTED HOT-TUBBING? OH, YEAH. YOU ARE FEISTY. I LIKE THAT, I DO. HIS EGO'S THE SIZE OF BRAZIL. I HAVE TO STOP TALKING. THAT'S OK. I'LL BE OVER THERE. YOU JUST START THINKING ABOUT IT, AND IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND, COME ON OVER. IF I DO CHANGE MY MIND, YOU'LL KNOW BECAUSE MY BREASTS WILL BE HEAVING AND MOIST WITH PERSPIRATION. SO LONG, FOXY. SO LONG. HE ONLY GAVE US ENOUGH MONEY FOR ONE DRINK. BEING SINGLE IS LIKE THIS? HE'S GOT A GREAT ASS. TOO BAD IT'S ON HIS SHOULDERS. HE'S CUTE. I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST CUTE. I WANT SOMEONE WITH HALF A BRAIN. GOOD LUCK. [VOMITING] HE WENT UP BEFORE SCHOOL, AND HE WON'T COME DOWN. ALL RIGHT. I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO. THANKS. DEAN, IT'S BALES, B-A-L-E-S. RIGHT, BALES. I KNOW THAT. WELL, HE'S NOT MOVING OR ANYTHING, BUT HE DID IT ONCE BEFORE, BUT HE'S NEVER STAYED THERE THIS LONG. IT WILL BE ALL RIGHT, HONEY. C.D. WILL TAKE CARE OF IT. HEY, WHAT'S THE TROUBLE, PETER? COME ON. WHAT'S THE MATTER? THEY CALL ME PORKY AT SCHOOL. WHY DO THEY HAVE TO DO THAT? GOD DAMN IT. I SHOULDN'T SAY THAT IN FRONT OF YOU. DID YOU TALK TO YOUR MOTHER ABOUT IT? ONCE I TRIED, BUT SHE SAID I HAD TO CLEAN UP MY PLATE FIRST. NOW, SEE? THAT'S GOOD. YOU'RE WAY BETTER THAN THESE GUYS THAT MAKE FUN OF YOU. YOU'RE SMART, AND YOU'RE FUNNY. YOU CAN MAKE THINGS UP. I DIDN'T MAKE IT UP. IT'S TRUE. OH. BASTARDS! I SHOULDN'T SAY THAT IN FRONT OF YOU. DO I HAVE TO GET DOWN NOW? NO, NO. LET'S JUST STAY UP HERE FOR A WHILE. THAT'S OUR NEW COMPUTER. YEAH. WE CAN PINPOINT ANY FIRE IN TOWN. I SEE. IT'S PERFECT FOR US BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WE'RE THE FIRE DEPARTMENT. THAT IS PERFECT. HI. I'M ANDY. GOOD TO MEET YOU. I JUST WANTED TO WELCOME YOU. THANKS. SO, OK. HEY, THERE IS ONE THING. HAVE YOU MET THE CHIEF? NO. HE'S FUNNY-LOOKING, SO I WOULDN'T MENTION IT. I WOULDN'T. I FIGURE YOU WOULDN'T, BUT SOMETIMES, YOU KNOW, THINGS KIND OF ACCIDENTALLY SLIP OUT, AND THEN, YOU KNOW... KECKKK! WATCH IT. WHO DESIGNED THESE STEPS, THE MARQUIS DE SADE? WHY IS THIS THING SO HEAVY? IT'S MOSTLY AIR. AND GLASS, SO BE CAREFUL. MY AUNT KNITTED ONE OF THESE. IT WAS MUCH LIGHTER THAN THIS. YOUR SECRET RELATES TO THIS THING, RIGHT? SORT OF, YEAH.

I THINK I DISCOVERED A COMET. YEAH? YEAH. IT'S NO BIG DEAL, YOU KNOW. THERE'S LOTS OF COMETS, BUT I WAS WORKING ON THIS PAPER, ON THE OORT CLOUD. THE OORT CLOUD, YEAH. I DISCOVERED A MATHEMATICAL IRREGULARITY. I HAVEN'T CLIMBED THIS MANY STEPS SINCE I VISITED THE MAHARISHI. LET'S GO. GO ON. WELL, I THINK A SERIES OF 10 COMETS... WATCH IT AROUND THIS CORNER... ARE ACTUALLY THE FORERUNNER OF A BIG COMET DUE BACK THIS SUMMER. SO YOU'RE GOING TO FIND IT WITH THIS THING. NO, THIS IS TOO SMALL. MY UNCLE'S USING THE BIG SCOPE IN ARIZONA. SO I'VE CARRIED THIS FOR NOTHING. NOT REALLY. PUT THAT COUNTERBALANCE ON THAT ARM. WHAT DO YOU GET IF YOU'RE RIGHT? NOTHING. I GRADUATE, THAT'S FOR SURE, AND I GET TO NAME IT. THAT'S PRETTY GOOD. SORT OF HISTORICAL. YEAH. COMET KOWALSKI. KOWALSKI? WHY? YOU CAN GIVE IT A BEAUTIFUL NAME. THAT'S MY NAME. IT IS? ROXANNE KOWALSKI? YEAH. OH, SORRY. WHEN DO YOU FIND OUT ABOUT THIS THING? JULY 14th, 2200 HOURS, 8 MINUTES, 31 SECONDS, GIVE OR TAKE 10 DAYS. THAT WOULD REALLY BE SOMETHING. YEAH. DON'T LOOK NOW, BUT THE VIKING JUST CAME IN. OH, GOD, IT'S HIM. CHRIS, COME SHAKE HANDS WITH ME. I'M THE MAYOR. YOU'LL LOOK IMPORTANT. HE SHOULD BE BRONZED. EVERYONE SAYS YOU'RE FAST AND BRILLIANT. BRILLIANT... WITH THE LADIES. TAKE CARE. IF YOU GET HURT, C.D.

THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO TELL. WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE? OK, WHEN HE COMES OUT, I'LL INVITE HIM TO A NELSON TRADITION OF HOT-TUBBING, AND I'LL SET HIM UP WITH SOME WINE, AND I'LL "BABE" HIM A LOT. I'M SHOCKED. WE'RE ALL SHOCKED. I'M NOT SHOCKED. I NEED CONFIDENCE, CONFIDENCE, CONFIDENCE. A LITTLE WATER, THEN YOU'RE TALKING TO HER. OH, NO! SHIT! HI. REMEMBER ME? I'M TRYING TO PUT IT BEHIND ME.

MAYBE I'M IN THE PRESENCE OF GREATNESS. YOU MEET C.D. YET? THE CHIEF? NO, NOT YET. THERE'S SOMETHING YOU SHOULD KNOW. HE'S GOT A BIG NOSE, RIGHT? WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T STARE. I WON'T STARE. NONE OF US WOULD, BUT YOU GET THERE AND FEEL YOURSELF NOT STARING. THEN YOU THINK, "IT'S OBVIOUS I'M NOT STARING." SO YOU LOOK. THEN YOU THINK, "I'M STARING." SO YOU SAY, "THIS IS RIDICULOUS." YOU TAKE A GOOD LOOK, AND YOU THINK, "I'M LOOKING AT A MAN WHO, WHEN HE WASHES HIS FACE, LOSES THE BAR OF SOAP." THANKS, GUYS. OK. DON'T SAY WE DIDN'T WARN YOU. WHOOP! DID YOU SEE THAT ON HIS FACE? DO PEOPLE GO TO SUN VALLEY BECAUSE THEY HAVE A GREAT FIRE DEPARTMENT? YOU'VE GOT TO USE PROMOTION. THAT WAY THE TOWN GROWS, THE FIRE DEPARTMENT GROWS.

ISN'T THAT USUALLY WHAT YOU GET AT THE END OF A RELATIONSHIP? ACTUALLY, IT'S REALLY ROMANTIC WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT. I'LL EXPLAIN IT OUTSIDE. C.D., HERE'S YOUR BLUSH. COULD YOU GIFT WRAP THAT? OK. AND THESE ITEMS I'VE DECIDED AGAINST. OK. GOT A GIRLFRIEND? NO. IT'S FOR MY SISTER. YOU HAVE A SISTER? NO. IT'S FOR MY SISTER'S GIRLFRIEND. UH... [TELEPHONE RINGS] HELLO? OH, HI, CHRIS. NO, I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING. I WAS JUST, UH... JUST MAKING SOME EGGS. YEAH, SURE. COME ON OVER. OK, BYE. I THOUGHT YOU SHOULD READ THE LETTER BEFORE IT'S SENT. OK. ONE SECOND. PERFECT. IT'S QUITE AN OPERATION YOU HAVE HERE. WHY, THANK YOU. OK, OK, OK. LET'S LOOK AT THAT LETTER. I THINK IT'S REALLY GOOD. "DEAR ROXANNE, HOW'S IT GOING? "WANT TO HAVE A DRINK SOMETIME? IF YOU DO, CHECK THIS BOX." WELL? HOW LONG DID YOU WORK ON THIS? WELL, TODAY, SINCE NOON. NOON. CHRIS, THAT'S A VERY LONG TIME. YOU CAN'T SEND HER THIS. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT'S GOT TO BE MORE INTERESTING. I WORKED HARD ON THAT. TAKE A PEN. SIT DOWN. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT HER? HOW DID YOU FEEL WHEN YOU FIRST SAW HER? HORNY. OK, OK. BUT YOU CAN'T SAY THAT. YOU HAVE TO CHANGE IT A LITTLE. YOU HAVE TO SAY, "I FELT MOVED, ALIVE, ON FIRE." THAT'S BEAUTIFUL. HOW DID YOU FEEL WHEN YOU SPOKE? LIKE A DICKHEAD. YOU CAN'T WRITE THAT. YOU HAVE TO SAY, "I FELT LIKE A CHILD "STANDING IN THE SUN FOR THE FIRST TIME, FEELING ONLY YOUR RADIANCE." RADIANCE. I LIKE THAT. I'M GOING TO UNDERLINE THAT. WHAT DID YOU DO AFTER YOU SAW HER? I PUKED. "AFTER SEEING YOU, MY ONLY NOURISHMENT WAS YOU." C.D., YOU WRITE THE LETTER. YOU'RE DOING GOOD. YOU KNOW HOW TO SAY WHAT I FEEL. YOU WRITE IT, AND I'LL SIGN IT. NO, NO, NO. THAT'S DANGEROUS. THAT'S LYING. NOT IF YOU WRITE WHAT I FEEL. I'LL JUST SIGN MY NAME, AND YOU WRITE TO ROXANNE WHAT YOU IMAGINE I'M FEELING. WHAT I WOULD IMAGINE YOU'RE FEELING. IT'S PRACTICALLY HALF-WRITTEN ALREADY. THAT'S JUST POETIC BALONEY. THIS IS BEAUTIFUL. FOR ROXANNE, YOU NEED SOMETHING STARTLING, SOMETHING SO STRANGE THAT IT WOULD MAKE HER INCAPABLE OF BEING REASONABLE. IT WOULD BE AN INTERESTING CHALLENGE. YOU NEED A GOOD PEN. GET YOUR FAVORITE PEN. THESE ARE GOOD. ALL RIGHT. AND SOME GOOD PAPER. OH, THE FOOD. I'M TAKING CARE OF THAT. YOU JUST TAKE YOUR TIME.

WHAT KEEPS THEM TOGETHER? MUTUAL ATTRACTION. OH, THAT'S FAIRLY ROMANTIC. YEAH. STRANGE ATTRACTORS IN MY WINDOW OF POSSIBLE MOVEMENT. SAY AGAIN. PASSIONATE KISSES I HOPE YOU'LL READ WITH YOUR LIPS. ROXANNE. SORRY. JUST SOMETHING FROM A LETTER I GOT. OH, YEAH? YEAH. AN AMAZING LETTER. AH-CHOO! YOU LIKED IT? NO, I DIDN'T LIKE IT. I LOVED IT. WHOSE LETTER? CHRIS. HE CAN WRITE? I'M MELTING. LET ME SHOW YOU THAT DUMBBELL NEBULA. THERE'S SOMETHING I DON'T GET. HERE'S A GUY WHO DODGES ME FOR DAYS, SO I FIGURE HE'S NOT INTERESTED, BUT C.D. TELLS ME HE WANTS TO WRITE ME A LETTER, AND I FIGURE IT'S GOING TO BE ABOUT WHY HE WON'T TALK TO ME, BUT IT'S NOT. IT WAS STRANGE AND INTELLIGENT... AND SEXUAL. [HARMPH] WHY IS HE WRITING YOU? HE ONLY LIVES A BLOCK AND A HALF AWAY. CHARLIE? WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO, ASK HIM OUT FOR YOU? SHE WANTS A DATE? HA HA HA! C.D., IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF YOU! HEY, HEY, COME ON! HEY! WHOO! WHOO! [COUGHS] HEY, HEY, WHAT'S THE MATTER? WHAT'S THE MATTER? SHE WANTS TO SEE ME TONIGHT? I CAN'T SEE HER TONIGHT. I'M DYING ALREADY. IT'S ONLY 3:00. HEY, JUST RELAX. YOU GOT TO HELP ME. IF I TALK TO HER, I'LL DIE. I'LL GIVE YOU SOMETHING TO MEMORIZE, AND YOU JUST SAY IT. NO, I CAN'T MEMORIZE. OF COURSE YOU CAN MEMORIZE. SAY THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE. YOU MEMORIZED THAT, DIDN'T YOU? I GOT YOUR HAND. I PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE TO THE... FLAG OF... WHICH COUNTRY? I DON'T KNOW. I'M NERVOUS. ALL RIGHT, WE'LL THINK OF SOMETHING NOW. OH, BOY. HI. HI. NO LETTER THIS TIME, JUST FACE TO FACE.

GIVE ME YOUR COAT. WORDS, WORDS, THEY'RE ALL USED UP. THEY'RE HARD TO SAY. GIVE IT TO ME. THEY'VE ALL BEEN WASTED ON THE SHAMPOO COMMERCIALS AND THE FLAVORINGS. ALL THOSE BEAUTIFUL WORDS. I MEAN, HOW CAN YOU LOVE A FLOOR WAX? HOW CAN I USE THE SAME WORD ABOUT YOU SOMEONE ELSE USES ABOUT A STUFFING? I LOVE YOU, AND I CAN'T USE THE WORD. I CAN'T HEAR YOU. IT'S BECAUSE MY WORDS HAVE TO RISE UP AND THEY'RE HAVING TROUBLE FINDING YOU. YOU'RE NOT HAVING TROUBLE HEARING ME. WELL, YOUR VOICE FLOATS DOWN, BUT BE CAREFUL... ONE HARD WORD FROM YOU KILLS ME.

DID WHAT I WROTE TO YOU TOUCH YOU? IT DID. IT WAS ELOQUENT. OH, NO, NOT ELOQUENT, JUST HONEST. SEE... I AM IN ORBIT AROUND YOU. I'M SUSPENDED WEIGHTLESS OVER YOU, LIKE THE BLUE MAN IN THE CHAGALL, JUST HOVERING, HANGING OVER YOU IN A DELIRIOUS KISS. YESTERDAY, ON THE STREET, I SWORE I HEARD YOUR NAME. I SWORE I HEARD SOMEONE SAY IT, AND I TURNED, AND THERE WAS NOBODY THERE, JUST FIVE BIRDS RISING OFF THE GROUND. WHEN THEIR WINGS HIT THE AIR, I HEARD YOUR NAME AGAIN, AND JUST FOR THAT SECOND, I WAS ONE OF THEM, POUNDING OUT YOUR NAME... ROXANNE. ROXANNE... A WORD OF TWO SYLLABLES LOCKED INSIDE MY HEAD. YOU SEE... I AM, AND I WILL ALWAYS BE... THE ONE WHO LOVED YOU WITHOUT LIMITS. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? IT'S TOO MUCH. GO ON. IT'S WORKING. GO ON. THIS IS MY WHOLE LIFE RIGHT NOW, STANDING HERE, TALKING TO YOU LIKE THIS, SAYING THINGS I'VE WANTED TO SAY BUT COULDN'T. WHY COULDN'T YOU TALK TO ME? I WAS AFRAID OF HAVING YOU LAUGH AT ME. THAT'S SO SILLY. NO, NOT IF YOU KNEW. WHEN YOU'RE REACHING FOR A STAR, THERE'S A LONG WAY TO FALL. I ALMOST NEVER LET THIS MOMENT HAPPEN, AND NOW I FEEL SORRY FOR PEOPLE FOR WHOM IT NEVER COMES. I LOVE YOU. I HAVE BREATHED YOU IN, AND I AM SUFFOCATING. I AM CRAZY. I CAN'T GO ON. THIS IS ALL TOO MUCH. I'M STARTING TO FEEL A LITTLE DIZZY. AND I'M STARTING TO FEEL A LITTLE DRUNK BECAUSE I HAVE MADE YOU TREMBLE UP THERE. YOU ARE TREMBLING, AREN'T YOU? LIKE A LEAF ON A TREE. I WANT TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU. SHUT UP, CHRIS! WHAT? I... I WAS TELLING MYSELF TO SHUT UP BECAUSE THIS TIME I'VE GONE TOO FAR. I'LL TELL YOU WHEN YOU'VE GONE TOO FAR. SHE WANTS US. LOOKIT, C.D., IT'S OK. SOONER OR LATER. YOU CAN DO IT. COME ON, COME ON.

THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER TONIGHT, ROXANNE. WHY SHOULD WE SIP FROM A TEACUP WHEN WE CAN DRINK FROM THE RIVER? THERE'S A TINY WORD. IT'S NOT A NOUN. IT'S NOT A VERB. IT'S NOT AN ADJECTIVE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS, BUT IF YOU SAID IT TO ME TONIGHT, ALL THIS BLACKNESS WOULD GO AWAY, AND YOU AND I WOULD BE CONNECTED BY A TUNNEL OF LIGHT. WHAT IS THE WORD, CHRIS? YES. YES, ROXANNE. YES. YES. YES, CHRIS. YES. GREAT. WE DID IT. WE DID IT. C.D.! C.D., WE WERE GREAT. I THINK I'M IN LOVE. OH, GOD, I DID IT. OH, SHIT, I DID IT! OH, GOD. I TELL YOU. IT'S TWO MINUTES TO DALLAS. OH!

HE WALKED LIKE THIS. [PUCGH PUCGH PUCGH] HE PUT HIS PALMS RIGHT ON MY FACE, TOOK ME OVER TO ROXANNE'S HOUSE. THEY WANTED TO OBSERVE ME. AT ROXANNE'S HOUSE? THIS IS BULLSHIT. WE'LL MISS DALLAS. COME ON, GIRLS, LET'S GO. [PUCGH PUCGH PUCGH] YOU THINK I'M NUTS, RIGHT? NO, NO. THEY WANTED TO ASK ME ABOUT OLDER WOMEN. THEY WANTED TO HAVE SEX WITH THEM. THEY WANTED TO START A COLONY OF SUPERMEN WHO WOULD HAVE SEX WITH OLDER WOMEN BECAUSE, AND I QUOTE, "THEY REALLY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING." WE DO. DO YOU BELIEVE THERE ARE CREATURES FROM SPACE WHO WANT SEX WITH OLDER WOMEN? LET'S GO CHECK IT OUT. OH, DEAR! [PUCGH PUCGH PUCGH] ROXANNE! ROXANNE, LET US IN! TESTING. HELLO. UH, HELLO.

HOW COULD YOU TRICK ME? I WAS TRYING TO MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD. YOU WERE PLAYING WITH ME. YOU COULD HAVE FIGURED IT OUT. THE SIGNATURES DON'T EVEN MATCH THE HANDWRITING. WHEN YOU'RE GETTING LOVE LETTERS, YOU DON'T COMPARE THE SIGNATURE TO THE HANDWRITING. YOU WANTED TO BELIEVE IT. YOU WANTED ALL THE ROMANCE, ALL WRAPPED UP IN A CUTE LITTLE NOSE. YOU EVEN GOT ME IN BED. YOU WENT TO BED WITH HIM ON YOUR FIRST DATE. ONLY BECAUSE YOU SEDUCED ME. SOME FRILLY WORDS, AND YOU'RE COUNTING CEILING TILES. I DON'T CONSIDER THAT I WENT TO BED WITH HIM. WELL, SOMEBODY WAS UP THERE, AND IT SURE WASN'T ME! WHO WAS IT? CHRIS COULDN'T HAVE SEDUCED ME. THAT'S THE POINT I WAS MAKING TO DIXIE. YOU TOLD DIXIE? I JUST MENTIONED... YOU SON OF A BITCH!

WHAT DID YOU SAY? 10 MORE SECONDS, AND I'M LEAVING. WHAT DID YOU THINK I SAID? I THOUGHT YOU SAID, "EARN MORE SESSIONS BY SLEEVING." WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT MEAN? I DON'T KNOW. THAT'S WHY I CAME OUT. 10! 9! 8! 7! WHAT ABOUT GILLIAN? I TOLD HER ABOUT HOT-TUBBING. CHIEF, CHRIS CAME AND TOOK ALL HIS STUFF. [SNIFF] THERE'S A FIRE SOMEWHERE. GET INTO GEAR.

WHAT ARE FRIENDS FOR? SO LONG. I WOULD CLOSE MY EYES AND SEE YOU AGAIN AND AGAIN... YOUR EYES, YOUR FACE, THE WAY YOU WALK, YOUR STYLE, YOUR WIT, AND YOUR NOSE, CHARLIE. IT DOESN'T QUITE WORK, DOES IT? I WENT INSIDE AND THOUGHT WHAT IT WAS ABOUT CHRIS THAT ATTRACTED ME. IT WASN'T THE WAY HE LOOKED. WELL, AT FIRST IT WAS THE WAY HE LOOKED. IT WAS HOW HE MADE ME FEEL. HE MADE ME FEEL ROMANTIC, INTELLIGENT, FEMININE. BUT IT WASN'T HIM DOING THAT TO ME. IT WAS YOU. ALL THESE OTHER MEN, CHARLIE, THEY'VE GOT FLAT, FEATURELESS FACES. NO CHARACTER, NO FIRE, NO NOSE. CHARLIE, YOU HAVE A BIG NOSE. YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL, GREAT BIG, FLESH-AND-BONE NOSE. I LOVE YOUR NOSE. I LOVE YOUR NOSE, CHARLIE. I LOVE YOU, CHARLIE. WELL? ARE YOU KIDDING? IT'S LOCKED! LOCKED! OH!
