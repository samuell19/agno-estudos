Present a film by Bohdan Slama FOUR SUNS You know what your problem is? I'll tell you. You don't care about future. You just don't give a damn. An instant benefit, that's what you're into. Fuck the future. Things will sort themselves out. You know what? They won't. Nothing ever sorts itself out. Listen, if you don't feel like doing this, just go away. - I can't stand the sight of you. - What do you want? - Do it properly. Use your leg! Man, piss of, I mean it. Get out. Hi, Karel. This one? She can't be here. Can't she? Grab it. Grab her. Go down. Come on, down. A bit more. Come on. And stop. Now you got connected, right? This place would kill her. What is he doing? Looking for the place. I don't get it. - Hey, Jara, I've brought the glass. - Thanks, mate. Cool. - How're you gonna put it together? - No idea. Each window is different, isn't it? Make sure you don't break it. - How about a wire? - What do you mean? - Tie it together with a wire. - It can't hold together. Just use the right wire. You're no dumbass, man. - Can I go out, dad? - Be home at five. - Yeah. - Does yeah mean yeah? - Yeah. - Thanks Jerry. Bye. - Bye, Karel. So our baby boy must be home soon? Hey, cool it, Jerry! Cool it! See ya. This is a good spot. How come you're out? - You know what time it is? - No. - Have you been drinking? - I haven't. - Go home. - Right now? - Go home right now. And don't you dare pouring booze into them kids. I didn't pour anything into them. Did I pour anything into you? - Vena isn't here? - No. I met him by the playing field and sent him straight home. Well he's not here. He hung up on me! He hung up on me. I'm gonna beat the shit out of him. Go to sleep, honey. Are you crazy? She's asleep! He stole my pot. Look, this was full. - I told you not to bring it here. - Can't I keep some pot at home? Well I guess you can't. Hi. Vena! Vena! Come. Jara, have some with us. Is that mine? Does it taste good? Man, Jerry, I thought we are friends. But I guess I was wrong. - Don't get mad. - I am mad. Come. Occupied. Hello. Come. Come here. You with the beard. - Why? - We'll discuss it later. Just go. - Is it the drain again? - Why are you not at work? I handed a notice. I'm sick of that shit. They fired you, right? What have you done this time? Nothing. Don't lie to me. I glued it. Screwed shit. I can't go on anymore. A ruptured joint. Hello. Hello. Your ID. - It's for your husband. - It's his parcel. - I can't give it to you. - He's busy all day. - Do you have his approval? - Do I need it just for a parcel? Yeah. We can deliver it to you sometimes in the morning... - Nobody's at home in the morning. - No delivery then. - Well then, thanks a lot. Bye. - You're welcome! Rules are rules. - Do you have a sec? - Hang on. - Sit down. - I've got people there. - They can wait. Jana, do you realize how bad you treat those people? You must get more shine, more light into you. - Wake up your inner sun. - Tell me how. - Sure, stand up. Just feel this. Right here. There is a block right by your heart. You must let it flow inside you and stop building barriers. Can you feel it? - Is that all? - Yeah. - Hi! - Hi! Hi Annie. Jesus Christ. Hi Vena. You got a parcel from your mum. - What was going on here? - A pillow fight. - Have you eaten? - A bun. - Have you fed the guinea pigs? - Yeah. - Wort you open it? - No. - Why? Just open it. - It'll be too small anyway. - You never know. Open it. Look, this is cool. Try it on. It'll look great. Didrt I tell you? - Try this then. It'll be good. - No, it won't be good. It won't. Irena is such a cow. Vena? I'm sorry. Do you want me to throw the next one right away? You'd better do. Should I wash this? Alright. Sign it here. Here are your applications. The job application is mandatory so you have to fill it out. The dole application is optional, fill it out only if you worked for 12 months in the past 3 years. Come back when you've filled it and I'll register you. Hi. What are you doing here, man? - Hello. How can I help you? - I want a job. Have you been employed or studied recently? - I went to a professional school. - Did you finish studies? No. I'll need at least a credential as of when you studied there. You understand that? Yeah. See you. Vena? What are you doing here? Grab that backpack, now! Come on! Are you ashamed of me? Are you? Why don't you walk next to me then? Hello. I'm sorry, I just wanted to make sure he'd come here. Keep quiet and write down a definition of a slide friction. Why go to school? Does anything force them to? No. They get away with everything. I keep telling him: You gotta be good at something, or you won't get a job. He pretends to be listening but he isn't. That's the worst. - He makes me feel desperate. - Can I give you a piece of advice? Search inside yourself. Kids often repeat what their role models do. Goodbye. Let's continue. A slide friction. I'm all stressed out. I'm stressed out. Come in, Karel. Come. Keep your shoes on. Come on in. Come in. Hi girls. - I haven't made the soup yet. - You haven't? Karel is here. You can't sleep here. No way. Here. Hang on, Karel, we can't sleep in the living room. Come here. Stand here. You must feel it. The safety. Well? You think so? But still, couldn't you try to tune up the bedroom? Bring Jana over. - Go, hurry up! - Sure, sure. - Jana, could you come over there? - Where? Karel needs you there. Both of you are ridiculous. Karel... Karel, she doesn't believe it. Karel, wait. Listen, I'm really sorry. See ya. Look, you take five at once so it's easier to count to hundred. Try it. Wait, this one's got bad tummy. See the tummy? That must go. And this one? Not good enough. You let nitrogen in, ok? They practically suffocate in there. Chuck them in. Hallo! Hallo! The awful hens scratch everything. The eggs aren't won'th it. - Hi Karel. - Hi. - You want some tea? - Yeah. - Take a seat. - Thank you. Karel, I have this idea. You have the skills, people need you, why don't we start a business? I might be your manager. Perhaps it's not such a bad idea. It is. Ok, have it your way. You just didn't get anything. Sorry, Karel. - You must be stealing them. - No, man. Hi Annie. How's your day? I guess that's enough. No more. You can put tomatoes, lettuce here. - Sure, man, anything. - Fucking dill. Hey, could you give me a little for a joint? I could. What's wrong with him? I said just for a joint. - Are you pissed off with me? - I don't want Vena to smoke pot. - I'll watch over him. - You want me to trust you? Take that! Grab it! Lift it! We'll put it there. Put it down. We'll draw it to the post. Think of Karel. Evie is fed up with him. - Hang on, Karel mustrt work. - I see. He's a spiritual person. We must provide for people like him. I'll get that. - Hi Karel. - I'm in with you. Really? That's great. - I want to speak up. - That's good. We all need that. - Will you arrange it? - Yeah. Come on in. No, I must go get ready. - Thanks. - Likewise. See ya, Karel. Come in. Find your seat, ok? Let's start, Karel. I don't think any more people are coming. Why are you here? Why have you come here? Have you come to me for help? But I can't help you. You must help yourself. We tore ourselves apart from the Earth, we've lost touch. All important things are down there. All around us. Let's try to feel it. Switch off your brains. Your whole body must feel. Can you feel it? I need quiet. - Silence, I need quiet. - Sure, Karel. Guys, could you turn it down or switch off? Please. - I'll buy you drinks. - Fuck off. - Let's go, guys! Come on! Now each of you, concentrate on your own stone. It is sending you some vibes. Can you feel it? Can you feel it? Can you switch it off? Karel, calm down! - How do you switch that off? - Stop it, Karel, calm down. - I can't believe that. - Leave him, Zdenda. It washes your brains! - It washes your brains. - Zdenda, let him be, man. Leave him, Karel. Zdenda, calm down. - Come on, man, let him go. - Let's get out, Karel. Karel! How did it go? I failed. Sweetie. Life's been hard on you, hasn't it? I heard punk is dead. High quality. - Has Jana seen it? - She hasn't. Man, she'll be over the moon. - Do you have some pot, man? - Sure. - Is that the pot I gave you? - No. You've smoked it all, haven't you? You beast. Tonda! Shots on me! Man, you look just like your dad. You're his fucking spitting image. He was a great guy, man. A friend. A real friend. We'd hang out all the time. Do you remember him at all? You must have been like three or something when it... - Three. - Three, right? What a shame, man. I should have been in that car with them. It's been so many years. Where is that all, man? Where the fuck is it? Where is it? All those years, what is it? What is it, man? Nothing, man. - What are you two faggots doing here? - Get out. - See the way he treats me? My son? - Piss off, mum. Please. Man, why are you so mean to me? Piss off. Fucking hell, piss off. I hope she'll kick the bucket soon. Don't say that, Jerry. Don't say that, man. Don't say that. Jerry. - Jerry, pull over. - I've got it all pimped, man. Pull over. - I said pull over, man. - Jesus, I am. Jerry, pull the fuck over. Come on, get off the car. What are you doing, man? Fuck you, man. Shut the door! - Give me the keys. - No way. Jara! Jara! - What the fuck? - You'll find it tomorrow. Let's go, Vena. What? Am I supposed to leave it here? You pissed me off. Asshole. Cunt. Fuck! Shit! What an asshole, man! I'm going home, man. What have you done to him? I haven't done anything. Come on, come. Hello, it's me again. I'm lost. It all looks the same here. So we've found each other. - Valentova. - Kotlin. I'm sorry to bother you but your son hasn't shown up at school for two weeks. Take a seat. Sorry. Thank you. He's never done this before. This is the first time. And when he does show up, he's unfocused, inattentive. I don't know. Isn't he on drugs? No, no. I'd know that, wouldn't I? - We had a conflict. - Did anything happen? He called me names. What names? He said I'm a moron. I think he has trouble acknowledging authorities. I don't want to go into details of your private life but... - Is everything ok at your home? - Yeah, sure. Yes. They just can't put two and two together. Some people never can. And there's quite a lot of them. This is my car. - Well, goodbye, then. - Goodbye. Thank you. It just doesn't work. Your son took after you. Actually, he's my stepson. From his dad's first marriage. And what is his relationship with his own mother like? Awful. He's never forgiven her that she left them. This is terrible. And look at the consequences. 70% of all couples break up. It's more than a half. See? What will happen next? When these kids start having relationships? Will they cope with it? You know how hard it is to keep a relationship? - Sometimes it just doesn't work. - Tell me about it. I'm about to get a divorce too. I have a garden here. You want to take a look? I'm sorry. We have a garden too. Wow. Is this all your work? See? Just a little rain and the slimy buggers are all around. Awful. Come on in. You want to take a look upstairs? Alright. - Ouch. - I bang my head there all the time. - Hi. - Hi. The car is broken. I couldn't start it up in front of Vena's school. Hi there. - How did you get home? By bus? - Yup. How are things with Vena? He has to go there. And as for the physics, I'm not sure. - Someone must help him. - Have some. So? What do you say? Will you go there? What does this uhm mean? - I need to hear something else. - What? Yes. Just say yeah and I'll be fine. - Yeah. - Does yeah mean yeah? - Yeah. - You think it sucks there, right? - So much. - What sucks there? - Our class-teacher. Such a moron. - You're right at that. - Why do we have to be so vulgar? Jesus, vulgar? So he's a moron. That's never going to change, man. Morons all around. You can't avoid it. Please. I don't want to. I know I'm a fucker. A shitty fucker. But you know I'm trying. I keep trying. I love you so much. Eva? I'm in deep shit. What happened? I slept with someone. What? Who is it? Vena's class-teacher. What do you expect me to say? What am I to say now? Well thanks. That's really helpful. Jana, you have a family, kids, you have everything. Alright, Christ. Why don't you slap me? I have a right to live too. How I wish I had what you have. Come with me. Karel? - Come with me. - Where to, Karel? The Master is calling. What Master? Are you coming? You mean right now? Yeah. And where to? I don't know. Sorry, Karel, let me think it over. I'll wait. Should I turn off? Karel, should I turn off? Go straight on unless I say something. - How far is it? - I don't know. We're running out of gas. What the fuck're you doing, Karel? Do you want to go with me or not? You know what I think, Karel? You're fucking nuts. You've gone nuts, that's all. Pull over if you want. I can walk. Jesus, Karel, cool it. Should I turn off? Go straight on unless I say something. - Vena, you know where dad is? - No. - What happened to you? - I got into a fight. - Who with? - With Bohous. - And why? I don't want to talk about it. Let me see. Hold it there yourself. He's a swine. He started dating Andrea. - Did you talk to her about it? - Yeah. - What did she say? - That she's dating Bohous. I see. Fucking hell. Such a dimwit. It's awful when one forgets his own wife's phone number. Oh well. What're you drinking, girls? - Vodka. - Vodka. - Can I invite you for a drink? - Yeah. - Sure. - Four vodkas, ok? Why not? - Anything else? - Some peanuts? - Yeah, peanuts. Another fire broke in a Japanese nuclear plant Fukushima. Six days after the earthquake and tsunami the biggest amount of radiation leaked into the air. Rescue operations in the affected areas are getting complicated... - Are you going to bed? - I couldn't sleep anyway. I'll call the police. Don't be silly. - Isn't Karel here? - No, he's not. He's never been out all night like this. - Take a seat. Do you want tea or coffee? - No, just water. Vena, go to bed. - Thanks. - Good night. - Good night. Jana, all the money we've saved for the new roof is gone. I'll give you the money back, Karel. - Turn off now. - Where to? - There. Vena! Vena! - Hi. - Hi. - Get dressed, we'll go for a lunch. - We've already had a lunch. - Get dressed and come. - I'm not going anywhere. Go to her. I don't want to see her. Not her, not that asshole of hers. - At least go say hi to her. - No. Vena! Vena, come on! - I'm not waiting. - Well, go then. - Get dressed and come. - No. I'm not going to repeat it a thousand times. - What are you doing? - Mind your business. He's my son. He doesn't want to go! - Hands off, you. - I said get out! Are you mad? How dare you treat him like that? It won't let me go any further. Karel! Karel, what happened? Here. Give it to the Master and he'll send me his one. I can't go any further. - And where will I find him? - Go. You'll see the sign. What sign, Karel? The sun will give it to you. Go. Alright, then. What do you want here? I'm sorry, I... I'm looking for the Master. There's no Master here. Karel is sending you this. What is that? - Do you know any Karel? - No. Get out. Goodbye. The Master is sending you this. Thank you. I've never been this happy. - Hi. - Hi, daddy. Hi. Hello. Hi. - Where've you been? - On a trip with Karel. Sorry. Come here, sweetie. - What's new at school? Everything ok? - Yeah. - Do you go there at all? Pass me some. Watch out, he's coming! Man, it's your stepmother. You think he fucks her? He sure as hell fucks her. Perhaps they're making a strawberry jam. Swine! Calm down, man. Calm down. What was that? You bastard! I got cut. Listen, I might have spotted your boy among them. - Vena? - Yeah. - Hi. - Hi. - You'd better finish that meal. - I'm not hungry. No way. No wasting food here. Come back! What's wrong with him again? He hasn't said a word since he came home from school. - Wort you go speak to him? - No. - He trusts you. - But I don't want to. What's wrong with you, man? What's your problem? Tell me. Nothing. Why don't you ever tell me anything? What do you have me for? Vena? Man, I'm here for you. - You know what I've been thinking? - No. We should have another baby. It might bring us back together. And we could build a house in our garden. You want to pay it from my wage at the post office? - We'll sell this flat. - Say no more, please. Ouch. - Nothing. - Let me see. I fell and got scratched... - Where did you fall? - It doesn't matter, I'm fine. - Does it hurt? - No. I'm getting up early. - Good night then. - Good night. Good morning. I guess I should explain you something. - I don't want to hear anything. - I see. Rolls. That looks great. Did anybody take any money out of this box? - No. - But I had a thousand in here. - Well, it must be there then. - It's not. You didn't take a thousand from there, did you? No. - Where is it then? - I don't know. If you took it, put it back and we won't talk about it anymore. - I didn't take anything. - You're lying. Look into my eyes. Look into my eyes. Listen, I... I'm such an idiot. I forgot I paid some money back to Eva and I used that note. Sorry. I see. - Sorry. - That's ok. And have some tomatoes. You need vitamins. These tomatoes are shit, right? The tomatoes from a store. Wait till we grow our own. In our garden. Right? We just have to make sure no parasites get into them. - What parasites? - Slugs or something. We can pick the slugs out and spray the plants, no worries. I can deal with slugs alright. Can we move away? You've got kids. Vena is a big boy, he can stay with his dad. I'll never leave my kids. You can't take their dad away from them. You're right, this is no life. I'm sick of that bitch. And you know what is the worst thing? Our kids took after her. Similar features, similar gestures. That's just horrible. This one will stay here. - He'll go to sleep now. - No, I'll hold him. Hold him then and sleep. Both of you, alright? Close your eyes now, cheeky tots. You don't wanna tell me you're coming from a class meeting. No. Is Annie asleep? Sorry but I can't stay with you anymore. I'm moving away with Annie. - I've just put her to bed. - I can't put it off. I gotta go now. Are you nuts? What has that moron done to you? Arert you on some pills? - Let her sleep. We'll discuss it some other time. - Stop being hysterical. - Annie, you want to stay, right? - Let go of her, please. I told you he's a moron. Come back home. - What happened? Come. - I screwed up again. Annie, will you play here now? Good girl. Sit here and I'll get you some toys. Hi Karel. Give me the bag, Jana. The girls will stay over tonight. Go back home to Jara. Do you realize what you're doing? - Yeah but that's up to me, isn't it? - It isn't. Don't you get it? You're stupid. - Why are you so stupid? - Enough. It's so rude of you. - How dare you judging her like this? - You don't understand anything. - Don't talk to me like that. - Can't you feel her darkness? My God, Karel, you are a lunatic. - Who was it? - My old man. Leave it. You'll need that. - Where is that bitch, man? I don't know. Come with me. Come on. - Where to? - Get dressed and come. Come here. Stand right here. On this spot. Take the Master's stone and hold it tight. - You've got to let the vibe flow. - Leave me alone, Karel. Do what I'm telling you. Please. It's an ordinary stone. There was no Master there. It was nothing but bullshit. And you know why, man? So I could finally get rid of you. His mother was always bitching: Look how long your hair is All his friends went on the same way She's right, that old missus Be one of us... What are you doing, man? What are you doing? Look where you're going, man. You're fucking driving me nuts, you bitch! Fuck off. Jerry! Man! Man! Man! Hallo? Hallo? Hold on. Hold on. Hallo. Yeah, I can hear you. Yes. What? - Hi Jara. - Hi. - Come in. - Is Jana here? She is. Come in. - Do you know where Karel is? - No. - Didrt he come to see you? - He did. - And where is he? - I don't know. Jara? Kids had a car crash. Jerry and that girl are dead. Vena is fighting for his life. Jesus Christ. No! Go to Annie. It's all my fault. Don't be silly. Pull over, please. - I can't. We're on a highway. - I must get out. Pull over, please. I can't! Pull over, I must get out. Please, pull over. Leave me alone. Forgive me. I'm stoned, man. I guess I am. Hey, man, aren't we dead? Are we dead? Arert we dead? Are you hungry? Stop asking stupid questions and eat. Go away. Go away! Go! I'm gonna take a piss.
