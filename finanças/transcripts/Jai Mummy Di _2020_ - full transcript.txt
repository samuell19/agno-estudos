Get on the floor -We're going to dance tonight -Get on the floor -All my kin and friends -Get on the floor -We're going to dance tonight -Get on the floor -There's no stopping tonight -Get on the floor -One with the black dog -Get on the floor -Get on the floor -Get on the floor -I won't stop dancing -Get on the floor I won't stop dancing tonight I went to the fields I went out to the fields And I brought back A glass of whiskey Now fill my glass up I went to the fields I went out to the fields And I brought back All my friends from Delhi Who have no class Do whatever you want to do Tonight I won't get off the floor... Who invited her here? Pinky's brother, Shammi, is related to Mr. Bhuller. I really don't understand what is the fight all about. Get lost. Why can't you two be friends like you were in college? Never! She isn't as classy as me. Where is Khanna? Just point me in their direction. And I'll beat them to a pulp. Look out, Uncle. -You can't even stand straight. -Uncle. Pinky. Where are you? I am coming, Pinky. I don't get it. What's the matter with your mom and Laali Aunty? Their friendship was anyway confusing and, so is their enmity. It just exists. Why did you steal my design? I didn't steal your design, you stole mine. And you even wore it the same day that I did. I had this stitched by Designer Manish Malhotra. I don't go to local tailors like you. -Manish Malhotra? -Yes. The one in Karol Bagh? What? Let's all go have dinner. Everyone's praising the butter chicken. How do you tolerate Khanna in college? What can I do? My mom has to compete with Laali Aunty over everything. Sometimes I think you two might have an affair because of all the time you spend together. It will never come to that. When guys in college find out that I want to get into a relationship, they will queue up outside my classroom. Here comes the free-loader sniffing free food. I'll WhatsApp this video to your mom. Then we'll see what a wise girl you really are. Son, let's go inside. I am famished. Nandi is the caterer. And his butter chicken is delicious. You go ahead, Uncle. I'll teach Bhalla's daughter a lesson first. I set out in my car Hey, where are you taking the butter chicken? Sorry, sir. This is only for family members. I know. Even I'm family. Serve me some too. Don't fool me. I know you're not family. Asshole, I said serve me some butter chicken! Asshole! I am going to take you Head-on tonight Where the hell Where the hell is the lentil soup I'll punch your face I'll punch your face and turn it red I wanted to drink I wanted to drink With the butter chicken I wanted to drink With the butter chicken Get on the floor -We're going to dance tonight -Get on the floor -All my kin and friends -Get on the floor -We're going to dance tonight -Get on the floor -There's no stopping tonight -Get on the floor -One with the black dog -Get on the floor -Get on the floor -Get on the floor -I won't stop dancing -Get on the floor I won't stop dancing tonight Yes, what is it? Teji threw the garbage from your home in my courtyard. Keep it. And tell her my roof is not her dustbin. You can tell her yourself when she comes to your house in the evening. Right now she will listen only to me. Keep your garbage. Take that. -Teji! -Yes, Sister-in-law. What's wrong? Next time when you want to dispose the garbage throw it in Bhalla's living room. Don't worry, Mom. I am going to score more than Bhalla's girl. She thinks she's too crafty. Yes, Mom. Defeating that son of a gun is the only mission in my life. Mom and son's eyes will pop out seeing my scores or you can change my name. Winning is a habit for us Khannas, not a hobby. I'll send you the picture of her sullen face after the results. Okay, Mom. Bye. I'll call you back. What's wrong? Bad breath? College is almost over. What now? We still have farewell, final exams. Look, we managed all these years because we only had to pretend on weekends. That's true. So what now? My mom doesn't like you at all. We aren't really getting married. Let things continue the way they are. Don't be absurd. We are going to get married, obviously. I'll convince both the moms. You do know that if Mogambo and Gabbar find out about us there will be a gang war in the lanes of Lajpat Nagar. You don't seem scared of your mom when you want sex. That's not even a valid question. At that time I only think about you. In fact, I always think about you. Mummy-Mummy Mummy-Mummy Mummy-Mummy Mummy-Mummy Mummy-Mummy Mummy-Mummy If my father found out about us He won't spare you I'm telling you You come in my dream Secretly every night O My mother doesn't like you!

Mummy! Mummy! Mummy-Mummy-Mummy O my mother doesn't like you Nor your fair face, I'm telling you Although I still love you, my love Although I still love you, my love Puneet Khanna. I know you will never have the courage, so I'll ask you instead. Go away or I'll break this bottle. No, baby, don't do that. You will hurt yourself. On your head! I want to talk. I want to get married. I don't want to marry right now. Fine. Give me a date, time and venue and take as long as you wish. I hope you know that it'll only lead to trouble. It can also lead to riots. You're going to marry whoever your mom chooses. She's ignoring me Giving me attitude She isn't curing my pain Breaks my heart Makes me weak Putting pressure on my mind And having fun alone Breaks my heart She's ignoring me Listening to sad songs I admit it's all my fault So stop testing me Don't break my heart Your sweetheart's heart Is in a lot of pain Well, we got a good deal on the house and thought why don't we move out. It's a bigger place. When it comes to Puneet's mother, I have no say in the matter. I am going to miss you guys a lot. Don't make me emotional. Next year you'll be moving to Ghaziabad as well. Yes, of course. -But there's one positive side to it. -What is that? This will put a full stop to the fights between Pinky and Laali. -Puneet, hurry up. -Yes, Mom. She isn't coming. You don't know? She's gone out for the weekend with her new boyfriend. How do you know? He's the brother of my friend's sister. Vikrant Singhania. What a guy. That means he is your friend too. Do you think I am stupid? I'm older than you, show some respect. Trotting in your underwear. -Aren't we supposed to wear underwear? -Shut up. She's ignoring me Giving me attitude She isn't curing my pain Breaks my heart Makes me weak Putting pressure on my mind And having fun all alone Breaks my heart She's ignoring me Listening to sad songs I admit it's all my fault So stop testing me Don't break my heart Your sweetheart's heart Is in a lot of pain You came in my life in a jiffy And deserted me Watching you from afar My eyes are overwhelmed Let's share a drink together Who am I going to tell That my heart's screwed? My heart and body's aching And the tears don't stop The silly girl gets upset with me And breaks my heart She's ignoring me Listening to sad songs I admit it's all my fault So stop testing me Don't break my heart Your sweetheart's heart Is in a lot of pain Yes, Mom. Saanjh, tomorrow is Jassi and Jassi's wedding. And you're coming along. Umm, okay, Mom. Yes? Tomorrow is Jassi and Jassi's wedding and you're coming with me. So what do I do? -That stupid Punnu's going to be there. -Oh! Doesn't that guy look like Punnu? Don't remind me of that asshole. I've had three relationships after him but none of them were as stupid as him. You're abusing him with such authority. You still have feelings for him, don't you? Don't try to fool me. And anyway, now he's from Ghaziabad. And you know I hate Ghaziabad. It's such a cheap place. Okay. Next time when you run into him, take a test. What test? If your heartbeat doesn't increase when you see him that means you've buried your feelings for him. -And if it does? -You can seduce him again. I didn't seduce him. He came to me, okay? Get a girlfriend. All the negative energy in your life will turn positive. Trust me. No, I can't do it. I am not over Saanjh yet. You've brought me to this boring wedding. Look! Stop pointing. It's not polite. Forget all that. That's the guy right there. I've already fixed a meeting for next week. Dev studied in the same school as you. He's a great boy, so is his family. Just don't say no. -Where do they live? -They live right here in Rohini. The family owns a chain of shoe stores all over Delhi. The best. Yeah. -Okay. -Really? If the guy's got an IQ like mine, I won't say no. Where are you going? It's delicious. Stupid fellow! She is our enemy's daughter. Mom will never say yes. Return my phone. Mom, he's going to Dubai without telling you! You can go if you want to. But you'll have to take me along. I am tired of this item girl. Why don't you ever talk some sense? Come on, let's go take a walk. I am in no mood. Take Vineet. Come on, you come with me. -Dad, we just got back. -Let's go again. I'll tell you about the aunt in Mumbai. What's the story? The story is more interesting than Silky's wedding. -Come on. Take my glasses. -Yes, take him along. He's not going back with us. He'll hire a rickshaw. Don't change the topic. You should be happy for me. I am getting a raise, plus an extension abroad. Fine, take me with you. I will, once I settle down. What if you start dating some random girl in Dubai? I know all about Dubai. What do you know? The girls are pretty clever. Dad was lucky. It's hard to find someone like you. You will if you look hard enough and have good intentions. You'll find the one made for you. What about Pinky Aunty's daughter? I should have set you straight on the day I saw you two sharing ice-cream together. Then you wouldn't have made such stupid demands. I was just joking. Don't be so dramatic. Chill. Meet with Bhatia's daughter. Then I'll chill. Okay, fine, let's discuss this tomorrow. Let's go have lunch. Else, Pinky Aunty will finish everything. Yeah. -Let's go and eat. -Come on. It's better if Mr. Baluja and I talk privately. But dear, why do you want to talk to me? I didn't mean you, Uncle, I meant your son. Actually, no one gives me so much respect at home. -What's with the American accent? -It's not American. Great. But I would prefer if you talk to me in normal Hindi. Sister-in-law is too frank. Hey. I haven't said yes. So chill. Quiet. Come, Mr. and Mrs. Baluja. I'll tell you about their house in Ghaziabad. But why are you guys moving to Ghaziabad? Exactly. Ghaziabad hasn't got the same feel as Lajpat Nagar. No, actually... This is what I told Mrs. Bhalla as well. But she's moody. And she runs the house. Actually, I think we should let the kids talk in private. -Yes, of course. -Let's go. Let's go. Come on. You're so smart, intelligent, beautiful. Even your hair's so arranged. So why arranged marriage? I had 3-4 serious relationships but none of them were husband material. And the one who did, turned out to be a lunatic. So I broke off with him. Well, now your turn. There was a girl. But she fell for a badminton player from England. So I was out. My entire family is very interesting. People say we came straight out of some Sooraj Barjatya movie. So where's your house in Rohini? Sector 9. My grandparents have been living there for 27 years. Then you can just hop over whenever you want. Which one? Mrs. Khanna. Mrs. Khattar. I feel terrible for you. Why? Bhalla's daughter is getting married before your son. The cards were printed at my husband's place. Dated on the 16th of October. If your son's wedding gets fixed, do let us know. We'll give you a discount. Just meet her. -But why? -That's all I am asking you to do. -Here comes your uncle. Explain it to him. -Hello, Sister. -Hello, Son. -Hello. They've been trying to persuade us for two months now. -Yes. -Decent family. And their daughter is educated. No thanks, I'll go to Dubai alone. Don't try to stress me out. Then you have only two options. Take me with you or get married. You'll have to take your mother with you. You... They really liked your profile. Just meet their daughter once and I assure you, you won't say no. She is a real gem. He's crazy. Don't listen to him. Do as I say. Fix a meeting for next week at Gurdwara. Your dad said that you all went to Bangkok. Yes. Family trip. -What places did you see? -In Bangkok? We went to many places in Bangkok. I mean, no limits. We went to Mariamman Temple, then Wat Vishnu, then Wat Phra Kaew. We saw many places. Soi Cowboy and Patpong are very famous out there. Didn't you go there? -Really? -Yes. The minute people land, that's the first place they go. Seriously? Have you been there? Wear them. -Let's go. -It's fine now. Aunty. Uncle. Bye. Jai Mata Di. Bro, Jai Mata Di. JMD. Isn't the girl's brother overenthusiastic? Chanting Jai Mata Di in a Gurdwara. Who cares about the brother? But Sakshi seems like a nice girl. Sister-in-law was saying that she's done a buffet of courses. Singing, cookery, hosiery, and other things which I can't remember now. But she's a really nice girl. The family's really nice. The girl looks cold. Mom's crying and he's busy stuffing food. Can I get you a soft drink? Sister-in-law, Bhallas are going to be your neighbors again. So my attention will get divided again. So don't mind. When did this happen? Saanjh's getting married on the 16th of October. The wedding will take place in the new house. You answer the phone. See what you can do. Who is it? Yes. Teji, I want you to post on the group. Punnu's getting married on the 16th of October as well. Whether he likes it or not. -Why are you taking my plate? -Why are you getting angry? Yeah, just like you managed our relationship. After all, you're an event manager. I mean... Take it. You manage it then. My marriage has been fixed. I am sure yours is too. Yes, I met someone yesterday. Things are looking positive. I've even updated my status on FB. And even got 356 Likes until now. Haven't you seen it yet? You've blocked me on FB. Do you need any help? You remember? I would've forgotten if I could stop thinking about you. Nothing is possible now. Someone else has booked this plot. And yours, Gabbar. Yeah, Mom. Don't worry, take your time. Rammo's coming over. She will give me a hand. Yeah, don't worry. Yeah, okay, bye. Let's go. Don't just stand there and watch. When and where is the wedding? 16th October, Diamond, Noida. And I am sure that's where you're getting married too. So don't expect an invitation unless our mothers patch up. Did you guys get a booking at Diamond? Can you guys afford it? Well, we definitely can afford it. See, I told you. If our moms get their way, they will get us married to the same person. Yeah, seriously. I told mother the other day that I want to marry you. One minute. Your future wife, Mr. Husband. Well, actually, I am in a meeting. I see. But don't forget to call. Okay. You're so fast. You two aren't even married yet and you're already lying to her. I think I should leave. What did you think? I'll invite you to the bedroom to make out? That's a nice thought but I am getting late for office now. I can see that. You've been trying to convert small talk into a long conversation. When I was a child, a wise man said to me that I'll get married twice. Should I marry Saanjh too? That wise man must have been a bachelor and you're stupid to repeat the same mistake. Are you encouraging me to get married or discouraging me? Idiot. I am just your conscience. You decide what you want, not me. I'm the best... And I think you are again mesmerized by me. Yes, a little. I want to talk to you. Tell me now. I'm studying. Okay. If you insist, come to Central Market at 5. Your treat. Chatting with son-in-law, aren't you? Yeah. What are you looking at? Go on. Did you pack the orders? Why don't you answer my calls? -Why do you always ignore my calls? -When did you call? Check the missed calls. -Missed? -What? I've been waiting for so long. You're not answering my calls. -I can't come. I was just joking. -But I'm already in Lajpat Nagar. My mom's here in the shop. Come down to the shop if you can. Then I'll be impressed. -Money. -Will you do me a favor? Saanjh. What is Laali's son doing here? How would I know? He didn't come here to meet me. I've heard a lot about your shop. I just wanted to buy sweets from you. I have to invite a friend. You're distributing your own wedding cards? You look really excited to take the plunge. Actually, everything happened suddenly. Anyway, which sweet do you want? -One box of Kaju Katli. -Okay. -Does DL 3 AC 1987 belong to you? -Yes. Ma'am, you have to be careful while parking. It got towed away. Bring me a bag. Here you go, son. How much? Keep it. Go take a look. I can't take money from you. Let it be. He took it. Hurry up and tell me. I don't have much time. I... I have to go meet Dev. My future husband. You're short of time that's why you're sitting here. Shut up. He's very punctual. What's your brother doing here? Did you call him here? If he sees us here, he'll report it to my mom. Chill, buddy. We're not on a date. He's gone. So what is so important? My marriage has been fixed with someone else but I still have feelings for you. I am sure you do too. So you want to marry me? I thought if I have to get married, why not you? Baby, listen to me. Baby, listen to me. Sir, you forgot to pay the bill. I'll pay the bill when you bring it. Get lost. Although I don't know why you're angry. -But I am still sorry. -Exactly. You don't know. Remember how you insulted me when I proposed to you? I haven't forgotten that. I haven't either. But the situation is different now. You know. Saanjh, listen to me. Saanjh. Listen to me. Saanjh. Make one for me. May I? Marry me. I know you want to marry me too. Even if I agree to get married hypothetically, what will we do about Gabbar and Mogambo? Let's elope. -And then? -We'll come back in a couple of months. Mummy will have to accept it. And you'll have a whole new family. And a dumb brother-in-law as well. I don't think your mother and I can adjust. So it's better if we live separately after the wedding. And it's only fair. Why should only girls leave their family? The boy should too. Fine. I am moving to Dubai anyway. I am getting a job there. I'll get you a job there too. Excuse me, when did this happen? I am not leaving Delhi. If you want to be with me, then we're staying in Rohini. And I don't want a job. I want to start a business after marriage. This is not fair. This package will come with conditions. Marriage and Rohini. Let's go to Dubai. Rohini, etcetera, is impossible for me. And please stop objectifying yourself. You're not some package or plot. You're a human being. Pay him. -You pay for the fuel. -Come on. Shut up! -You're such a big jackass. -What's wrong? You have no guts to stand up to your family. And you want to take me to Dubai. You mean, you're considering Dubai? Of course. I'll go there for my honeymoon, with Dev. Saanjh. Saanjh, listen to me. What is going on? I don't know, Sister-in-law. If you don't know then find out. And if you can't, then spare us. I must find out. I am at your parents' balcony. Come soon. We must talk. Wow! From dumb to a bloody hero. Come on. Let's go. What are you doing? Nothing, Mom. Just closing the door. Why did you open it in the first place? She is strange. Why did you get down? I think fast. Is your brain in your knees? What are you thinking? I am thinking about what is more important. Career or a potential exciting life with you. If you have a doubt, let it be. Where there's doubt, there's no love. Love is pretty old and deep. The issue is boundation. Was. That was an issue. I am not going to Dubai. What? Fine, I won't go to Dubai. I'm captivated in your love. Your smile makes my heart skip a beat. I want to look at you all the time. What are you doing? Are you crazy? Mom might come in. To hell with your mom. If mom catches us, I'm screwed. Please leave. Punnu, please leave. I was just joking. I don't dare go against my mom. She scares the hell out of me. Leave. Are you sure you want to get married? It will only lead to more trouble. Riots even. Let things continue the way they are. We'll let things take its course. You must come. Of course, I will. Your daughter's wedding venue is the same as Pinky's son. Is this a mistake? I decided three years ago that it will be Diamond. Pinky is such a copycat. I booked the place first. -But you know how Laali is. -Yes, I know how crafty she is. I offered my younger sister's hand in marriage to her son. But she refused. You should be happy. You two had a close call with that stupid Laali and her idiot son. Pinky... I feel terrible. What do you want me to do? Celebrate? I don't feel terrible for you but for that poor family that's accepting your uncouth and rude daughter. Whatever, at least she's much better than your idiot son. Can you even count till 100? -Get lost. -Get lost. Let's go to Banwarilal for breakfast. Of course. Let's take our moms along too. Make it a family outing. Do it properly. I was reading that. Here. Listen, baby. ...what actually happened between them? Yeah. And if we sort whatever happened between them their friendship will get renewed automatically. Not bad, Punnu. But how are we going to do it? How? -Don't worry about decoration. -Okay. I'll give you the best decoration. The best flowers, lights, etcetera. -Okay? -Yes. Okay. -Yes, ma'am. -What took you so long? Ma'am, you know how she is. She takes so long to decide. Don't worry, ma'am. I'll give you the best decoration. Come inside. Same venue, same caterers, so are the decorators. Pinky Aunty and you have so many similarities. -Then why did you two fight? -Don't mention her name. -Take my advice and patch up with her. -Why? -Do you want to marry her daughter? -No. -My wedding is already fixed. -Then? "Patch up." I mean, set the unpleasantries aside but what happened between them? Frankly speaking, I don't care. Thanks to their quarrels, the atmosphere in our house stays pleasant. She invests all her energy in competing with Mrs. Khanna. End of my troubles. I asked her dozens of times to tell me what the problem was. But your mother never told me the reason. Pinky and Laali had this great reputation in college. They had a long queue of lovers. Was your name in that list too? Even I liked them a lot. In fact, I even wrote a couple of love letters but never got any reply. Manjeet. Son, I think I've hurt my wife's sentiments. Please leave. But, there must be someone who can help us. Professor Dixit. Manjeet. Jai mummy di Frankly, it's been so long that I can't remember anything. If I hadn't lost my 1991 diary, then I could've definitely told you. There must be someone who remembers something. Laali and Pinky's common friend. Harmeet. Rumors were rife in college that Laali and Pinky are girlfriends. They were always glued to each other. Jai mummy di I met Laali Aunty at RDC today. She was so polite. She even wished me luck for the wedding. She needs luck, not us. "Wishing us luck!" Yes, that's true. By the way, what did you two fight over? You just killed my entire mood. Mom, I was just asking... I apologize on behalf of Aadesh. Mom, we need to talk. Aadesh took on this responsibility willingly. -Listen, Mom. -What is it? Speak up. Can you come inside? This is serious. Sister-in-law, you two can talk here. I'll watch it in your room. -Make some fritters after this. -Yes. Don't mind what Aadesh said. Make it properly. Not at all, Daughter-in-law. Maybe I was... Hurry up, your father-in-law is coming over. First of all... -I've dropped the idea of moving to Dubai. -Why? You were so excited about going there. -I don't want to leave Delhi. -But we live in Ghaziabad. NCR and Ghaziabad aren't different. How can you say this? I see! I guess your wife has brainwashed you. That's not true. In fact, I was thinking about postponing the wedding. Shut up. You idiot. The cards have been handed out, bookings are done, and the relatives are already arriving. -And now you want to cancel? -But I can't do this now. I know you're scared if you can adjust with Sakshi or not. But she is just like me. Exactly like me. You'll be a perfect match. I think you were right. Let's run away. -They will have to accept us. -Yes. This is the only practical solution in this situation. Let's go to court tomorrow and get married. Huh! Okay. We don't have time for romance. Our weddings are in three days. To others. Go home and start packing. Are you crazy? Are you out of your mind? The entire family is busy planning your wedding and you're planning to elope with the enemy. I had a doubt when I saw you two at the café. I'll thrash you. Now that you know, stop lecturing me and support me. You always say that I don't respect you like an elder brother. Of course, you don't. What? Are you making it up for all these years? Just run away, Brother. Elope with her. Mom will complain, but I'll handle her. Just don't change your mind now. Run away. Why are you getting so sentimental now? You're always getting me in trouble. So what's wrong now? I like a Christian girl. I see, so that's the case. Who is she? -Irene Lal. -Great. That's the issue. Your issue's bigger than mine. It's our dad's fault. Did he ask you to have an affair? Irene was looking for an apartment on rent. Dad told me to take up the paperwork. We kept meeting. I got attached to her while sorting out her documents. I started caring for her. -We were bound to fall in love. -Yeah. Why be afraid when you're in love? What is your plan? Show some respect. -What is your plan now, Brother? -Yeah. Sandeep and Pinky. No one from your families? Come on. First, they elope and get married. Later pine for their parents. What if something happens to mom? I don't know. This doesn't feel right. It did sound right in theory. But practically, it feels wrong. Even I was told that I'll get married twice. The second time I'm definitely marrying you. My colorful heart has Turned black and white Standing all alone In the street at night My colorful heart has Turned black and white Standing all alone In the street at night Like a defeated lover Singing its woes Can't seem to move on Someone make a report At the Police Station Someone make a report At the Police Station Someone make a report At the Police Station My colorful heart has Turned black and white Keeps fighting with itself My colorful heart has Turned black and white Keeps fighting with itself Like a defeated lover singing its woes... I'm calling from 166 Raj Nagar. My neighbors are creating a nuisance. Can't seem to move on... Someone make a report At the Police Station Someone make a report At the Police Station Someone make a report At the Police Station You see, I can't think right now. Maybe I can think of something if we kiss. Puneet. Puneet! Yes, Mom. -What are you doing inside? -Coming. But what are you doing inside? Nothing. It's a boy's thing. I am coming. If you don't come out in five minutes, I'll send your father inside. Come soon, we've started the celebrations again. Come on. What happened? What happened? Do you have an idea? What if we tell our fathers? They are men of the house after all. It's the least they can do for us. And I can easily convince my father. Let's meet tonight with our fathers. This is my house, not the Company Garden. Mr. Bhalla, things always happen for the best. I say, this is it. Son. What you are doing is really good. I just made an initiation, Dad. Let's see how far others take it. So what's the solution? -Let's take a walk. -Oh, God, Dad. -Can't your father think sitting down? -No. Bombay Aunty, 1995. Bombay aunty won't work. He has just one idea. Let's hear it. Bombay aunty every time! Finally, Gurvinder got married to Nimmi. But, what you're saying sounds completely impossible. And we told you two about us so you can talk to our moms face-to-face. Look, son, I don't have a better idea than this. -Right, Mr. Bhalla? -Mr. Khanna is absolutely right. You... You have our support, even Vineet is with you. This fool's going to help? Stop hitting me. Of course, I am going to help. Now I even have extra motivation. Fine, let's discuss this later. Take advantage of this secret that I told you. Talk to mom. Yes, Dad, Uncle, think of something you two. Son, I actually want to tell your mom that Saanjh and Puneet will get married to each other. And not separately. In fact, I've already visualized everything. And even got slapped by Pinky. This is exactly why we don't talk to them. Take my advice. Let's execute "The Bombay Aunty" idea. It will solve our problems with no damage. -Exactly. -You two are so scared of your wives. Even I am scared of you. Okay, bye. What are you thinking about? What we're thinking of doing, isn't that injustice to Sakshi and Baluja? If we get married to them without falling in love, that's even worse. -And what if all our plans fail? -Why are you so negative? Be positive, dude. I'll handle both the moms. Then why are we doing all this? You handle them. One gets courage when you're in deep shit. Let's execute "The Bombay Aunty" for now. After all, it's your dad's experience. Please remember your lines properly. Rehearse them again if needed. Don't forget. Yes, he's coming. Can you... By the way, I really loved your idea of coming to the balcony. Isn't this so romantic? Just like Romeo and Juliet. I love it. Right? That's not it. If I had come through the main door, your family wouldn't like it. Seriously? You're really naughty. So tell me. I always come straight to the point. I don't like beating around the bush. But as you know, I've had four relationships in the past. You've had four, this is my first formal one. Am I a mistake? I'm getting married so I can hide this from my family. You're gay? You're gay? How can you be gay? Do you wear a V-neck T-shirt? Do you? Right. Because I've never seen you wear one. And then you're so handsome, how can you be gay? And anyway, there's no such thing as gay. It's all in the mind, I know. If I had told you after the wedding, it would be too late. The starting point was always sex and love followed after. All four? I don't have any feelings for you. I have a thing for guys. It's okay, Sakshi. I can understand it's difficult. I know everything is blank without sex. I even had BDSM with one-- I went to Bangkok with my friends for a few days. You know, for net practice. Imagine how desperate I was. I am so glad you're experienced and so am I. This is the case with one kiss. I'll convert you in one night. And you say you're gay. Have some tea at least. -No, I have to go see Rammo. -Ah! Rammo. Think, Mr. Khanna, think. Your Bombay Aunty plan bombed. Wait a minute. -Ideas don't come when under pressure. -I am really tense. Feels like India-Pakistan's final match. But there's no saying what Dhingra and Bhutto are going to do today. I just hope the kids get married to each other. And not separately. Be positive, be positive, Mr. Khanna. Understand? You know what? Take a walk and think of an idea. I'll do the same jogging. Okay. Go for it. Where are you? Coming. -Hello, Uncle. -Hello. -What are you doing here? -Yes. Why are you standing out here? I couldn't find your house. Your aunt's written it in my diary but I can't find the page. -This is the one, Uncle. Come in. -Really? Here, take this. Lock the car. -It's okay. I have to go buy eggs. -Chicken eggs or duck eggs? Come inside. Finally, I've arrived. -I've reached home. -Great. -How are you even speaking? -Through my mouth. -Welcome. Welcome. -Greetings, Sister. -Son, take Uncle Joshi's luggage upstairs. -Yes. What's wrong with you? Why are you sulking? I don't want to tell you. -I guess he's got cold feet. -Come in. I was a great guy But my luck wasn't in my favor Love turned my life Into a tragedy I was a great guy But my luck wasn't in my favor Love turned my life Into a tragedy Like a Tsunami razed Through my heart And curbed all the hustle and bustle The noose is around his neck now Life is ruined The noose is around his neck now Life is ruined The noose is around his neck now Life is ruined The noose is around his neck now Life is ruined -Yeah, what is it? -Did you think of a plan? How would I know? You were taking a walk on the terrace. So tell us. Can't you see how hot it is? I can't think. -Let's go. -I'll have to do something. Fine, let's go now. My desires have been shattered As our lives have been separated I've been engaged My dear mummy Why did you become so cruel? The noose is around his neck now Life is ruined The noose is around his neck now Life is ruined The noose is around his neck now Life is ruined The noose is around his neck now Life is ruined Hello. Is this Mr. Himmat? -Alia. -But doesn't she live in Mumbai? You two are... Stop. It will work for you. Let me explain the plan to Saanjh. We'll live separately after the wedding. In Rohini, in a 4-bedroom apartment. I don't care. You'll have to convince them or forget about the wedding. And don't drag my name into this. What happened? Tell me. He sounded like he won't come to the wedding. What's the scene? Ashleen, she's talking about dividing our family. What? She wants to live separately after marriage. She is testing you. That's how all the beautiful girls are. And what if she actually demands for it after the wedding? Take her on a honeymoon and she will automatically come under control. That's what Brother Bittu did. How do you know? I gave him this advice. Ashleen. You've grown up. Isn't it? I knew it. You're sending me pictures. And Baluja has already said yes to my demand. We're in big trouble. How do I call off the wedding? Do something, Punnu. Please. How can you laugh in such a stressful situation? What else do I do? Your situation is so hilarious if you see it objectively. You're my friend. Look at it subjectively and tell me what to do. Show some courage and tell your mom that you want to marry Puneet Khanna, -and not Baluja... -Mom... Okay, fine. Okay. You aren't ready yet. The guests are on their way. Hurry up. Help her get ready. -Yes... -These girls, I tell you! -Where is it? -I'm looking. Come on. Tell Saanjh's father to execute Plan B. Ask Hemant where Aliya is. -I am scared. -Do I have to do everything? Shut up. You two are good for nothing. -Why don't you yell at him? -Arlene Lal. I am going. -I was saying-- -You shut up. What are you doing? "This rascal has cheated on me. I won't let him get married." This rascal has cheated on me. I won't let him get married. What nonsense is this girl saying in Hindi? Dad, I don't even know her. What is this? Who are you? -Why are you screaming? -Jasso... Look at her. -Calm down. -Who is she? I said calm down. Dear, for how long have you known Dev? Where did you two meet? What are you looking around for? What do you want? Who are you? Mr. Baluja, what's going on? Nothing. I think she's confused. And Dev never lies to us. Lie? But what is this lie? Actually, I came to the wrong family. I had to say the same lines someplace else. I've got nothing to do with Dev. Hey! Listen. Is it you? No. You're not. Lata. He left me in this condition. I-- -That's enough. -How can he marry her? This is wrong. And we can't even stop this. Why don't you understand? They are coming in and going out. What is this? I can't do this. -Aren't you Aliya from Mandi House? -That's me. I know. But today I am feeling like Katrina. I cannot do it. Forgive me. -No, please. -Ms. Lata... Listen to me. Please, listen to me. She's going to get me screwed. Where's your wedding? Uncle, mom's waiting for you. Let's go. Come on. Let's go here first. -Come. -Mom has too much time on hand. For no reason. Father, she left. She isn't going to do it. -Dad says that I'm pure gold. -You're a gem of a son. She came here by mistake. Even if he had a couple of affairs, we'll still accept your son. -Accept him? -Yes. Sorry, but we're the ones who are accepting Saanjh's colorful history. -What do you mean? -Don't mind this, but Dev told us that your daughter has done it with a few guys. -Done what? -Sex. -What? -Dad. Brother, controlling her would be quite a task. Shut up, Ashleen. Don't worry, Son. We'll reform our daughter-in-law. My daughter is not a spoiled child. She's completely traditional. "Reform my daughter." She's had four boyfriends in the past and chose an arranged marriage. If I hadn't stopped her, the list would've extended. Watch your mouth. You're not married to her yet. Where will I get another girl on such a short notice? I think we'll have to think of another way. Mr. Bhatia, the decorations are too tacky. -Everything is just fine. -Two strong whiskeys. If we had done the decoration, this place would've lit up. Anyway, it doesn't matter. Hats off to your uncle, Jagat, and your mom. No one ever found out that Punnu's got one short leg. By the way, no one's going to mind if they find out now. He just limps. That's not a big deal. And anyway, the wedding is just a couple of minutes away. Nothing can be done now. Let's go on stage. -Gagan! -Yes, Daddy. I was saying... After four nuptial rounds, we'll have to do it at least four more times. Be prepared. Hold your horses. -You are in a hurry. -You should've asked someone else. Come on! Brother-in-law, can you please walk for us? Walk to where? Right here or there even. But why should I? Son, if you want to take a walk, take his father instead. He's the only one in our family who likes taking walks. It's time to exchange garlands. Dad knows that brother-in-law limps. He just wants to confirm it. Mind your tongue. Punnu is absolutely fine. Fine, then let him walk in a straight line. End of discussion. Mister. I am requesting you. Your demand is completely illogical. You claim that Punnu limps. This is not right. I feel humiliated. -Wait a minute. -Listen to me. What's the big deal if he walks a few steps? -Right? -Yes, yes, of course. -But why should I? -Yes, why should he? Yes, Mom. This is brother's insult. -Yes. -Shut up. -But Mom-- -Don't interrupt us. -But Mom-- -Go and check how far have Sanju and Sister-in-law Sonali reached. Why did you have to talk about sex? Unbelievable. She gave your privilege to others, and I can't even talk about it? Honestly speaking, I never liked the family. They are very nosy people, and noisy too. Thank you. You're humiliating and embarrassing us publicly. I am overwhelmed. And your daughter had a condition to live separately. And yet we said nothing. What are they saying? Mom, they are already blaming me. I never said anything like that. Hey! But that doesn't mean I will stand here and let my family get humiliated. -What happened to your accent? -It's gone, like your manners. Didn't you call me earlier and say we'll live separately? I agreed because the wedding was close. And now you're publicly denying it. Bloody liar. What can I say now, Mom? They claim that I am a liar. I can't stand this humiliation. Tell your family that I am not walking for anyone. Were they blind until now? Wait. You're getting serious. I'll talk to them. Dad, please. -Try to understand, dear. -You try to understand, Dad. Let it be. I've checked him from top to bottom. -He's absolutely fit. -You keep quiet. You're blinded by his love. You shut up or I'll smack you on the face. Go ahead, smack me. -Will this fatso even feel it? -Mom. -Dad. -Dear, we aren't demanding anything wrong. We'll have to clear our doubt. Firstly, Aunty, who gave you this doubt in the first place? -And such a cheap one. -Exactly. This is not done. -He's my son. -Dear. I heard you two saying this. Now you're denying it. It's not good to lie. Enough, enough of this drama. Let them just exchange garlands now. You keep the garland. Close the chapter. You missed all the fun. The bride's family claims that Punnu limps. Enough! I've had enough. There's no need to discuss this anymore. I apologize for any inconvenience, but we don't approve of this wedding now. Pinky, am I right? Let Shammi come. Look, there comes Shammi. -Look at this. -I'll handle this. This wedding now stands cancelled. Go back to your homes. -What? -This is not the way to talk. Go home, or we'll beat you with your own shoes. Baluja shoes. -He's drunk and out of his mind. -Listen! Baluja shoes shine better than your face. Guys like you want to work for me. Ungrateful people! I'll show you! You're not worthy of us. Get lost. You did the right thing. We would've handed our daughter to this wannabe family. Claim to be straight out of Barjatya movies but in reality, they're like Ram Gopal Verma. Who are you to yell at her? Son, if you have any respect and regard for your mom then you must walk now. He's perfectly fine. So was that it? Well then, exchange garlands. No. I can't be a part of such an impudent and rude family. Ask them to leave. What are you saying? What are you saying? Mom, look what he's saying. Explain it to him, please. It was just a misunderstanding. Please talk to Puneet. Please. This wedding is cancelled. This family isn't worthy of us. Ask them to leave. But we're the guests here. Shut up. The one who's made the mistake will bear the expenses and also leave. Sorry, Uncle, sorry, Aunty. Aunty, please don't cancel this wedding. Please, Brother-in-law, don't cancel the wedding. I told you to walk. I will never walk again. Don't cancel it. Please. Please, Uncle. Get out. Please, Mom. -Let's go. -Wait. Please, Puneet. Come on. -Wait a second. -Haven't you been humiliated enough? I am talking to them. Just wait! -Please. -I'll find someone else for you. -Where? -Someone from GK or Def Col. I see you're banned from GK and Def Col! -Where will you find? -I'm here for you. Brother? You're dumb. Stupid. You created this mess. Why do you care if he limps? Do you have to push his wheelchair? Tell me. -Do you want your husband to limp? -Yes, I do. -I am in love with him. -I'll talk to your heart. Come on. -Take her away. -Come on. Let's go. Let's go. I didn't apologize so many times when I was caught cheating in my board exams. -Come on. -Let's go. What a weird family. -Let's go. Let's go. -One says he is a limp. -Come on. -You were the one who heard. Jagat, where are you going? I was just... Just a minute. Wait. Get out, everyone. Sister, tell me about their caste. What is their caste? Have you lost it? This is such a serious situation and you're writing in your diary. Uncle, let's go and have dinner. There's nothing we can do now that the wedding is cancelled. -But we can still have dinner. -Absolutely. Yes, go. And take him along. And put some brains in him too. He's been a nuisance since college days. This is all your fault. You said yes to the wrong family because of your competition with Pinky. And now you are blaming me. Shammi, you talk to her. This isn't right, Pinky. -It will ruin your daughter's image. -Yes. We took a week off from college. -We won't be able to come again. -Look. I have an idea. Find some decent guy here and get her married. What are you doing here? I didn't invite you. I think you're at the wrong wedding. Get out. Let's go. You get drunk and go to the wrong place. Sister-in-law, weddings are not easy to plan over and over again. Why don't you ask Saanjh if she likes anyone? And get her married to him. -Exactly. Ask Saanjh who she likes. -You will give the approval but ask her. Check with Saanjh. Even Khanna's wedding got cancelled. We have nothing to do with them. Take it. -Saanjh. -Yes, Mom. Do you like someone? Mom... Oh, God. You've been using the same diary since 1991? Yes. My life is very boring. There was nothing to write. Ever since I started writing, I've been using the same diary. What's in it? I have the memory of a goldfish. I don't remember things and you know about it. How would I know? Tell me something. Wasn't mom in college in 1991? Even I was in college with her. Those were the days. Fritters in winter and holding Laado's hand under the bench... It was great. So you must know what mom and Pinky Aunty quarreled over. It's all written in the diary. But let me tell you this. Your mother has a gem of a heart. But she has a bitter tongue. Didn't you hear how she yelled at me? I was hurt. She called me nonsense. -She called you a nuisance. -Yes, that. But it was hurting. Yes, I get it. Why don't you look in the diary and tell me what happened? Mr. Khanna. -Yes. -I've convinced Pinky. Very good. Now bring Sister-in-law Laali to the banquet hall. If Laali finds out about our plans, she will kill me. Be brave, Mr. Khanna. Be brave. And we have an infallible weapon. -Who? -Mr. Sanju. Oh, yes! You're absolutely right. He's the only guy who both of them listen to. Now go and bring Laali. Understand? Jai mummy di Try to understand, Pinky. Now it's Bhalla's and Khanna's reputation that's at stake. I think you two should accept God's will and accept this. -Right? -Correct. No. Not a chance. -I don't care about the humiliation. -Yes. Even I don't want to bring her daughter to my family. Enduring her for the rest of my life! I wouldn't do it even if I am out of my mind. Think about our children. Punnu's so upset that he isn't coming out of the bathroom. I have a confession to make. -What is it? -What confession? I've always liked Saanjh. -What! -Have you lost your mind? What kind of a family is this? We're talking about his brother, and he's trying his own luck. No, Aunty. That's not what I meant. I like her as my sister-in-law. -Then say it like that. -Shut him up. One more thing... Laali and Pinky are turning their friendship into a relationship. I'll call you later. Hello. Stop this drama, Mom. We've already spent a lot on this wedding. -What happened? -Write this. That I'll get married in court. Be quiet, Son. Wait a minute. Look, your mom and Pinky Aunty are intelligent people. I'm sure they will take a sensible decision. Correct. Correct. Pinky is very sensible. Consider it God's will and get those two married. And put a full stop to this fight. -It's enough. -Right. Correct. Please say yes. -Yes, right. -Yes. You two hug each other. Uncles first. Come on. First, forsake your anger. Yes, go on. Give a tight hug. -Bravo. -There you go. Mom, come on. Shake hands you two. Forget the handshakes, let's just get on with it. Come, let's go over to our side of the lawn. -Come on. -Let's go. Come on. This way, come on. Seeing you two together reminds me of college days. I was just telling someone about our college days. Who? Who? He's nonsense. I was telling someone, Sister. Who was I telling? I even showed him my diary. I was telling someone. Don't these two look too happy? Yes. I think they fooled us. How long has this been going on? What, Mom? Your affair for which you got the weddings cancelled. From school to college, after that we broke up and got back together two weeks ago. -What? -Are you mad? He's talking nonsense. What's wrong with you? No need to hide the truth. They can't cancel our wedding now. Have you lost it? -Is this any way to talk to your mother? -I've seen what a drama queen you two are. I read everything about you two in Uncle Joshi's diary. When did this happen? And why didn't you tell me? I texted you. I was so excited that I forgot to read it. Where is my phone? What happened? Nothing to say? I shouldn't have invited Joshi. Joshi who? Jasbeer Bhuller. Diary? Congratulations. Mom... Hello. -Congratulations, son. -Come on. Be a man. Be a man. Whoever wins this arm-wrestling match, gets to score first with Sanju Ahuja. To hell with friendship. I am going to score first with Sanju. He likes me. So my mom's invited him for tea. Shut up. He has seen QSQT with me four times. And my mom's invited him for dinner. She said yes. Congratulate me. Congrats. My mom's allowed me to go out on the weekend. In the cold weather of Nainital. If you go to Nainital, I'll go to Europe. Europe, huh? First, you have to win. I've already won... -Guys, congratulate me. -Congrats. Sonali said yes. She also loves me. And you know, if any of us scores good marks we'll get married the very next day. But Sanju, you were involved with me. Shut up. You were involved with me, Sanju. Laali, Pinky, you two are just the same. So I didn't know who to get involved with. And in the meantime, Sonali got involved with me. -Who is this Sonali? -How dare she! From her mother's womb, and settled in my heart. Thank you for understanding. You guys look so happy for me. She said yes. Here, have a sweet. Now go to the cold weather of Nainital with your mother. -And what about your dinner? -You go to Nainital with Sonali. I'm telling you, bitch. Pinky, I am telling you. Go after Sonali. -Who is Sonali? -Am I your bodyguard? You should have gone. -Your mom called you, right? -I'm going to...
