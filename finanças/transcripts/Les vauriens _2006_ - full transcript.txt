Understood? Don't move! Ah, you caught him!! I'm first, I get the reward! - We ran after him from the beach! Don't try to rip us off. - Write your name and sign. And you! Spread out! There are still about 30 of them on the run. Catch them and we'll pay what you're owed. - There's no justice! - There you are, M'sieu'. Here are your 20 francs. - 20 francs? Great! - Great! Good bye. Are you looking for something? - You startled me! - Sorry. - I've come to look at the house. So, you haven't been informed yet? Mr Delpierre, the owner. He died last week. - I had a appointment with a notary, but ... ... I get the feeling he's forgotten about me. - That's not a problem, I have the keys. I'll show you. After you. I didn't know the house was for sale already. - It's not for sale. I'm Louis Delpierre's daughter. - My goodness! Well then, my condolences. - Thank you. - Robert Favart. - Ana Buisson, nice to meet you. - I was your Dad's ... friend. More like his brother. That's where we met, me and your Dad. In the Belle-Île-en-Mer colony. In 1933! This house should have quite an effect on you. - What was this colony exactly? - M Delpierre never told you about it? - No. Not about that, nor anything else. To be honest, I never knew my father. Were they orphans? - There was everything, all sorts! Orphans, vagabonds, criminals. Perverts. Little kids of 8 with big 17-year-olds jumping on them. The Legion and Cayenne rolled into one. Only worse! As for your dad, it was the 1914 war that sent him to Belle-Île. Because his father—Your grand-father... ... came home in 1918 badly injured. Half of his face blown away by a shell. Then— He started to drink and beat up his wife. One day, the father brought Loulou to work on a farm. Up at 4am, bed at 11pm, even on Sundays. To say nothing of slaps and being hit with sticks. It couldn't last. So one morning, Loulou ran away. Holy shit! 10 francs! Come on! Wake up! Louis Delpierre, Court of Rennes. Hurry up! Come in! - The new kid, Director. Stand up straight! -You may go, Jeaumont, thank you. - At ease. Delpierre. Your file isn't so bad. But you hurt your parents by stealing money from a poor farmer... ... who was trying to take care of you. - That's not true, Sir. I found the note on the ground. I didn't steal it. - And this, you didn't steal that either? You should say Director And speak only when the Director tells you to. - Our approach ... ... rests on 2 basic principles: Work. And Discipline. When you leave the colony, you'll be like all the rest. You'll be saying ... ... Thank you, Director. You get what I'm saying? One-two-one-two They disobeyed. Punishments can be as severe as 90 days in the block with water and dry bread. And believe me, that's not funny. Each time I need to punish one of my pupils, my heart bleeds. Cell 19. Mess tin! This is the punishment block. There are ordinary cells. And then there's cell 19. When you arrive at Belle-Île, the first night is always spent in cell 19. After that, you will have no wish to go back there. Chief! Chief! Go away! Come on, stand up! Have a wash first. Then refectory, with the others. You start work today. Hurry up! We don't have a whole day to waste! The first time I met your Dad ... ... was at the morning wash. He'd just arrived. He was skinny. I said to myself, it won't be much fun for him. What are you doing here? Get lost! Get out of it! Nevertheless, that day he did something. Something I will never forget. Whose cigarettes are these? Favart, I've warned you before! - It wasn't me, Chief! I don't know— - So, they're not yours. You think I'm fucking stupid? - Chief! They're mine. Bastard My mother gave them to me before I left. - So, it's yours? - I didn't know it was forbidden. - Right! You know now! Silence! To your places! Sit down! Berets! Boursi, beret! Are you a man, or a woman? What? Leave me alone! Leave me alone! - No talking at the table! Stand up! - What's going on here? - Nothing, Chief, it's the new kid. He talked at the table and spilled his soup. -That's not true, Chief, he didn't do anything! - Fine, it's ok just this once, since you're new. My name is Rold'Hom. You, pick up his tin. Refill it with soup. I'm a man of my word. And the rest of you! What are you waiting for? Eat! Nervous? The ones who want to be sailors come here to train. And then they go fishing for tuna in Spain. - Is that true? - Yeah but forget about it. You need to be a huge arse-licker to get there. I climbed up once. That got me 5 days in the block, but I don't regret it. My name's Robert Favart. You? - Louis Delpierre. Loulou. - Where are you from? - Chavagne, just outside Rennes. - Seriously? I'm from Saint-Gilles. - No kidding! Baviaux's watching you. He didn't like what you did in the refectory. - Is he a Chief? - A Chief? A bigshot, yes! That bastard'll give you a hard time. That's why we call him Baviaux. That one is the meanest fucker of them all. Put him in the block! Pinpin the Redhead. His real name is Merlin. But we call him Pinpin. Almost all the screws are mean. But he's the champion. - Get up! Get in line! Hurry up! In line, there! Take this! Quick! Now Giron. Take the bag to the cart. Why are you here? - Little things. But I got the 21 anyway. - The 21? - Yes, until the age of majority, if you like. You don't get out 'til you're 21. - But your mother? Didn't she say anything? - I don't have any parents. They placed me in the colony at Mettray, but I ran away twice. Then they sent me to Belle-Île. Because they think I can't escape from Belle-Île. But I don't care. At the first opportunity— At the first opportunity, I'm off! I've already got a plan. But ... It'll need two of us to succeed. I found someone but he chickened out. Are you interested? - I don't know. Maybe my mother will come and get me. Left! Left! - Favart! Delpierre! Vegetable duty! - Yes Chief! Hello my dear Robert. How are you doing? - I'm doing fine, Madam Guillevec. This is Loulou Delpierre, a new kid. - Hello. You don't look well. - Excuse him, Madam Guillevec, he's been in the block and he's not acclimatised yet. - Here you are. Take it, it's full of vitamins. - Thank you. The colony was rotten because all the bigshots had their bumboys and slaves. So, since we stayed together, I thought I'd help him not to be a target for too long. - And you? Were you a bigshot? - I could have been. I was strong. I wasn't afraid of anyone. But the bigshots, I hated them. We used to call them rats, snitches, who turned us in to the screws. Just to get in their good books. And I escaped from everywhere. They called me the escape king. I got respect. - Damn, I lost track of time. I need to find a hotel. - What for? For dinner, there's food in the fridge. And the house has 2 spare bedrooms. After all, it's your house. Cheers! Silly idea to buy a house in Belle-Île. Didn't it disgust him? - Good question. But it's the same for me. I came back here as soon as I could. - In any case, he had good taste. It's a little Eden here. - Mostly, it was a ruin. He had to rebuild it, stone by stone. In the traditional way. It cost him a fortune. At that time. But your Dad made a success of his life. - Yes, in crime. You call that successful? - No. In burglary, mademoiselle. Nuance. Well-known jewellers, wealthy aristocrats. Only premium targets, and no weapons used. Not a drop of blood. Anyway this house is yours now. - It is. I inherit a house bought with the proceeds of burglary. In law, it's called concealment. - There's a statute of limitations. - I don't approve of anything my father did. Especially remembering me on the day of his death. It's delicious. - This was your Dad's bedroom. Mr. Favart, please, stop saying "your Dad". - I'll get you a blanket. Nights can be chilly here. Tell me ... ... if you don't mind my asking ... ... what ... what is your profession? - I'm a juvenile court judge in Nantes. - Well, I'll be damned! That's surprising— - For the daughter of a convict? Yes, but I use my mother's name, Buisson, because... ... Delpierre, it's not so helpful for a career in the judiciary. - Oh yes! Yes, I can imagine! - Are you all right? What can I do? - I'm fine. - A glass of water? Do you want a glass of water? - Certainly not! I have a disease of the arteries. - Should I call a doctor? - No, no, no. No doctor. Nothing. No hospital either. I intend to die at home. And not quite yet. Otherwise I won't get to tell you the end of my story. I hope you don't mind. - No, I don't mind at all, but ... ... you must promise to take it easy. - One day, an odd bloke arrived at the colony. He changed our lives. Albert Ferrandi, I'm expected. - Are you the engineer? - Yes. - Is General Fisheries really going to build a factory at Belle-Île? - Yes. - You won't be able to see the pupils before tonight. They're on the beach, except for the ones who are being punished. - On the beach? - Yes, I mean they're collecting sand for the North building embankment. Fucking brat! You want— - Hey! No! No! No! It's fine. It's just water, no problem. In fact, I walked from the pier and my shoes were covered in dust. So, what this child—whose name is ...? - Loulou... Sorry. Delpierre, Louis. - So, what Mr. Delpierre did will save me having to clean my shoes myself. Which deserves a reward, right? - Right, let's go! A very good element. He's reformed. He's one of our group leaders. - I'd like to meet children of different ages and characters. The factory needs a very, very strong workforce. - Apart from a few who are hopeless, we only have good boys. You'll see them at work. - I got a glimpse of the colony when I arrived. Your facilities are remarkable. - Yes. We are far in advance of anything being done elsewhere. On your knees, or you're heading for the block! These poor souls have no feeling. No education when they arrive So the first benchmark we give them ... ... is that of obedience and authority. - In that I agree with you. - I'm a former prison director. So I know the drill. We give them a job. Healthy food. And they are paid on top of that. 25 centimes per working day. 12 hours maximum, we are monitored. Once a year the Minister visits the colony. May I show you the workshop? Yes! - Director, Guichard's mother wants to see her son, but— - Come in, Madame. - We can't find Guichard, Director. We've looked everywhere. But I don't know which group he's in. - Ask the monitor Merlin to come here. - At your service! - Is this your first visit? - I didn't know my son was here. I haven't seen him for 5 years. - Ah! M Merlin. We are looking for the pupil Guichard. - Gui ... Guichard? But he hung himself last week, Director. - Ah yes, that's right. We didn't have time to notify the family. We wanted to announce it with all possible discretion. Condolences, Madame. Hello there. - Hello! - I'm looking for the Guillevec house. - Guillevec? Oh,it's not far, straight ahead, then you'll see the barn. - Good, thank you. Thanks. - You're welcome. Hello. - Hello. Is this the Guillevec house? - Yes? Are you Mr. Ferrandi? - Yes. - Your luggage hasn't arrived yet but your room is ready. Give me a few minutes. - Wait, Let me help you. - You'll get dirty. Do you know Belle-Île? - No, I just came here to hire staff for General Fisheries in Lorient. - Come with me. I'll give you one of my husband's shirts while I mend yours. - No, that doesn't matter. - Come in, follow me. It should fit, you're both the same size. - Thank you. - It's a perfect fit. - Yes but I'm not sure your husband will appreciate seeing me wearing his shirt. - My husband was lost at sea 2 years ago. - Oh no! Forgive me. I'm so very sorry. - Right, come on, I'll show you your room. Fight back! That's it! En garde! You still have to move your feet! Go for it! Fight back, go! Bang, bang! Fingers in the eyes. Right in the eyes! Like this! - That's enough. I don't want to poke out his eyes. - Sure you do! the bastard deserves it. Go on! Straight to the liver! Go on! And the worst of all: in the bollocks. Delpierre! Giron! Dishwashing duty! - You can go to hell, Baviaux. - Hang on, I didn't quite get that? I told you: dishwashing duty! - Stop it, you'll kill him! - My leg! Go ahead, climb up! Go ahead! Climb! Go ahead! Either way Baviaux will get you the maximum. Go on, climb! Climb! - Come down! Loulou got 40 days in the block. Your knees, dammit! 30 for Baviaux, 10 for climbing the mast. Dry bread for breakfast, lunch and dinner. And a ladle of water and 10 hours circuit per day. Pretending to pull weeds without bending your knees. There was nothing harder. Except for cell 19. I passed him messages. That made him happy. And this time he took precautions. He kept a kitchen knife as long as his arm with him in the cell. But Baviaux didn't come. He was in hospital. His knee completely destroyed. If only it'd just been him ... ... His terror ruled the day ... ... but when night fell ... ... it was Ramaller's time. Coudareau! Last again? Come here. Did you think about the escape? - Yes! I might come with you. Since my mother probably won't come to get me. - You're lucky you've still got a mother. - Here, Look. This is her. - She's really beautiful! But I suggest you don't keep the necklace. Or it will end up in someone else's pocket. - You should come to my place. I'll tell her you're my friend. You watch, she'll be happy. - That's nice of you, Loulou, but ... ... I'd prefer to go to Paris. - Up to you. What's your plan? - Once a month the whole colony parades in town. Only colons who are sick or being punished stay behind with a screw. On that day ... ... Two of the block guys will be on roof duty. They give you a big ladder so you can clean the gutters. You get the picture? - Yes. - With the ladder we can sneak out. And the best part is, they won't even notice before the evening count. - What's that noise? I hear it every night. - Ramaller is sawing through the grille on Giron's bed. No! - Scream and I'll cut your throat. Help! Stop! At ease! Good! Coisnard, haven't you forgetten something? Your beret! Ramoney! Cadel! Lessieu! Director ... ... about Delpierre Delpierre! - My mother wrote me! - Are you the son of Armand Delpierre? War-disabled, living in Chavagne? - Yes, Director Your father has been called back to God. Condolences, my boy. Go back to your place. - Well? - My Dad died. - And your mum? - She was in love with a butcher. Probably lives with him now. Atten-shun! Deer Mum, yr litle Loulou beg you to come and tak him home. Yr der Loulou. I luv yu. Loulou. Stand up straight! This is the marine workshop. Here we work on deck fittings. And we have here an obedient and trained workforce. At the colony with the most modern methods. Watch. You, for instance. What did you know before coming here? - Nothing, Director. - And you? - Nothing, Director. - You? - Nothing, Director. - Well? What do you think of that? - That's very impressive. But may I know why they're here? - That's very easy. Jacquelet, orphan. Very good pupil. Coutenzeau. Offence of vagrancy. Favart. Ah, Favart! Broken streetlight on a public highway. Multiple escapes. Very bad element. Segonzac. Parricide. But he is a good element. This is the boy I mentioned to you. Delpierre. Thief, runaway. Ramaller. He killed and buried a little girl in a forest. Incorrigible pervert. Trouvé. That's his name, Trouvé. Found in the street at the age of 2. We don't even know his real name. Rigaud Removed from his step-father who ... You understand. A call for you in the office, Director. I'm coming! Sorry! The demands of the service. - Go ahead. I'll take the chance to talk to some of the boys. - Of course. Mr. Jeaumont? Come here! Stay with Mr. Ferrandi and assist him. - As you wish. - Thank you. Do you have a cigarette? - Yes. - So, you're the knight in shining armour come to save the children of misfortune? - Sorry? No, no! I'm just trying to give them jobs. That's all. - I've been driving up to the colony regularly for two years. I've seen children unhappy. Sick, or beaten. And everything I can't see but can guess at. Don't tell me you're surprised. - No. The day I arrived, I learned that a child had committed suicide. - It's so sad. And nobody cares. The kids keep their mouths shut. They're scared. Anyway, you're here to hire them, not to cry over their little misfortunes. - I might be able to help these kids. But for that, I'd probably need your help. - My help? Why me? - I tried to question them discreetly, to find out more about them and the colony. But I can never talk to them alone. The director is very suspicious. As if if they want to hide things from me. - So what? That's none of your business. - Actually yes, it is my business. - Then, you are hiding things from me, Mr. Ferrandi. What do you want now, Giron? - I know you're going to escape. I can hear you in the dorm. - Bastard! If ever you snitch on me— - I've got a new pack of cigarettes if you want it. Look! They're genuine. This'll pay the screw on duty. - What do you want in return? - To come with you. And you to say we're a couple. You and me. So Ramaller won't touch me any more. - You can fuck off, Giron. I won't let the others believe I'm a fag. And don't think you're coming with us. - Why shouldn't he come? - Look out! Screw! - Favart and Delpierre! Potato duty at Guillevec's farm. There's 200 kilo. Quick as you can! Helian, you slacker, hurry up! - Get a move on! Gentlemen! A glass of cider? I've got some fresh cider indoors. Ah, Mr. Ferrandi! Can you watch the kids while these gentlemen cool off? - Yes, of course. You can take your time, I won't turn them loose. - Thank you. - Gentlemen. Shall we? - She might be old ... ... but I'd definitely screw her! - What... ... what have screws got to do with it? - To screw her? You don't know what it mean? - Yes of course! - So what does it mean? - You get naked and you lie down on top of the girl. And at the same time you fondle her boobs. You see? - And you've done that before? - Of course, lots of times. - What's he doing here, the engineer? - Who, me? How have you been since we last met? - Why did you give me a cigarette because of the water bucket? - A cigarette? Oh yes, the cigarette. Because I'm not who you think I am. I write for a newspaper. I came here to see if you're all happy in the colony. - For a newspaper? Right ... - Do you believe me now? - That's a cop card! They have a French flag, too. - No, no, I'm a journalist, I swear. I just want to ask you a few questions. - But I don't know you. There are a lot of snitches in the colony. So in here, we learn to keep quiet. - Okay. Look Loulou— See my name on the card? It's Paul Alexis. And you know that the people here call me Mr. Ferrandi. So I lied about my identity to get into the colony. So now you could betray me. You could tell them everything tonight. You'd even get a good conduct ribbon and a glass of wine for that! - Me? Snitch on you? I wouldn't do that! Sorry M'sieu', but I'm not a rat. - No, I know that. - OK, good. I'll talk to you about what goes on in here. But in return ... You send this to my Mum. She will know where I am, and she'll come to take me home. She lives in Rennes, Ramey's butchery. But I'm not sure of the address. - You can trust me, I'll find her. - Hello, how are you doing? We had to escape. - I'm coming! That was our only chance. So, the next parade was on Sunday. We get punished, as scheduled. We bought Rold'Hom with the cigarettes and he gave us roof duty. He even gave us bread and a sausage. The only change in our plan was that Loulou ... ... convinced me to bring Giron with us. But that kid! He was puny. He had chest pains. And no luck. Giron felt ill. So ill that we weren't sure he could join us. He won't manage the first rung of the ladder. - Yes he will. It'll work. Hang on, Giron. - Guys, my head is spinning! I'm gonna throw up! - Leave him alone! - OK, go back to bed. Take a deep breath! We're not in a hurry. - Oh, don't be silly, Robert. He can't come. - Don't leave me. - But you're not strong enough! We'll get caught! So will you! - Promise you won't snitch on us! - What are you doing here? Take this slacker back to the dorm. That'll keep you busy. - Yes, Chief! - Hurry up! Delpierre. Delpierre. - Hang on, Giron. - Don't leave me here. Don't let me die here. - Come on, we're close. Hang in there, everything will be fine. - Get the blanket. - OK - Don't go! I want to come with you. Please! Favart! Come on. This isn't the time to admire the view. Let's get changed here. Dressed like this, no one'll notice us. - Where are we going? - Over there. Come on. Giron snitched on us. Bastard. - Shit! I trusted him. - Put down the bags. We run straight to the deck, right? - Yes. - Come on, quick! We managed to hide in the ferry sailing to the mainland with the tide. A- And then? - Then, we took our chances. We didn't know the area. We followed the side roads. We slept in barns. We stole apples. We were quite successful. That's my bike, you fuckers! Give me back my bike! Bastards! My beret! - There it is! - We're here! Look at that. Rennes! I'll take the coach. It's not watched as much as the trains. - Have you got money for the ticket? - I'll find a church box, don't worry What about you? Where does your mother live? - Above ... Above a butcher's. - I'll find it. Take care! - OK... Good luck in Paris. - Good luck with your mother. Oh my love! My Loulou! What are you doing here? - I ran away. - My Loulou! Sit down here! Are you hungry? Do you want something to eat? - Yes, I'd like that. Mum? Did you get my letter? - Yes. I couldn't take you back then. - Who's he? - He's Louis. Loulou. - What are you doing here? - I came back to live with my Mum. - There's no room for you here! - Yes there is. We'll put a mattress in the shed. Police! Good morning. He's here. Shit! No! No! - Mum! - Loulou! My Loulou! - Please mum, don't let me go! I don't want to go back there! No! - You'll wake the whole neighbourhood! - Mum! Stop, I don't want to go back there! Please, don't let them take me back there! - It's better that way. - Mum! Mum! No, not Belle-Île! Mum! Mum! No! Mum! Mum! They caught you too? - Yeah, I made a mistake on the coach. I didn't have a suitcase with me. The driver didn't believe I was going to Paris without a suitcase. - Of course! - He took me straight to the police station, the rat! - Shut up, Favart! Favart and Delpierre! Accused of escaping. Theft of food. Deliberate loss of uniforms belonging to the administration. And theft from a church. Mr. Merlin. What is the cause of the wound I see on this pupil's arm? - He hit his arm on the ferry, Director, while sailing back from the mainland. - It seems the sea was very rough. - Yes. This Court ... ... sentences Robert Favart ... ... to 15 days in cell 19. To include 7 ... in a straitjacket. And Louis Delpierre ... ... for whom the Court recognises there are mitigating circumstances ... ... due to the bad influence of his accomplice ... ... 15 days in the block. Moreover, the two accused ... Will each pay a fine of 30 francs. I don't think I need to remind you ... ... that a second escape attempt will lead to an immediate and automatic transfer. To the colony at Eysses. Which is not as permissive as ours. However. You can cut your sentence in half By denouncing your accomplice. Who assigned you to do roof maintenance? I insist on knowing his name. Otherwise, your sentence will be doubled. -Good! - Double! Delpierre escaped with young Favart, but they caught them. 15 days in a cell, they'll be in bad shape. - I'm meeting Fouchs tomorrow morning. I'll ask him to release them. Yes, I'll tell him I need to hire them quickly. He can't say no to me. - We can hope. - Annabelle, one more thing. Have you ever heard of cell 19? Oh shit! Chief! Toilet! Toilet, Chief! Chief! Yes! Favart. Good morning, Director - What can I do for you? - It's about 2 of your pupils. Delpierre and Favart. I've been told they're in the cells. - Correct. And you can't visit them. - Sorry? - I called the General Fisheries Company in Lorient. No one knows of a Mr. Ferrandi. I don't know who you really are. Probably one of these journos in search of a sensational story. Be aware that I intend to file a complaint against you. - And I am asking you to take me immediately to these children. I have every reason to believe they are being abused. - That's enough! Good day! - Very well. I promise you your facility will be the subject of a damning article. And that you will be fired in less than a month - My conscience is clear. And I act in the sight of God. - Well if God exists, he's sadly misinformed. - Are you a Marxist? An atheist? I suppose that's your own business. And in this case, you have no idea what my job actually involves. Mr. Villec, please! - In less than a month. So he refused? - Yes! I lost my temper. I just hope it won't backfire on the kids. I'm sorry. - Paul! - Yes? Why did you call me Paul? - And you? Why did you answer? It's my middle name, so sometimes— The lost hope of the children of Belle-Île. by Paul Alexis. I didn't go through your stuff. This morning I brought your tray, and when I put it on the table ... ... I knocked over some papers. Anyway, what I wanted to say is ... It's wonderful. You're going to save these children. You are after all— - I wanted to tell you the truth, then— - Actually, I suspected from the start. You don't look at all like a boss. - I take that as a compliment. This article is thanks to you. I'm also going back to Paris this evening to give it to my Editor-in-Chief. - You're going? - Yes. But I'll be back. Cell 19 is over for you, poor kid. You've paid your debt. Drink this! Drink it slowly. Slowly. That's it. It's such a pity your escape failed. No luck. Oh my boy! Next time ... ... there's a rowing-boat at Pointe Taillefer. On the rocks. It can't be seen from the path. It must have broken its moorings and washed up there with the tide. You understand? Get over there. Stay with Chief Marcel. Now boys, back to work! Help! Mum! Mum! I'm dying! Mum, please come! Who told you to move? - It's about Giron, Chief. It sounds like he's dying! Mum! Maybe we should take him to the infirmary, Chief. I'll show him how we treat fever in the African Battalions. Get me a bucket of water from the well! - From the well? Yes, Chief. - Mum! - Shut up! I'll sort you out! - But it's freezing, Chief - That's perfect! Attention! At ease. There really is abuse, right? - Death to the tyrant! This time, I'm calling Emergency Services. - Nothing! Do nothing! I need to get a move on and finish my story. I don't have a lot of time. - Do you want to rest a little first? - No, no, no. The escape ... ... happened naturally. We didn't even have to think about it Section C, to your places! Sit down! Berets! Serve! - Chief, Chief! Coutanzeau is eating his cheese! - Coutanzeau! Who the hell do you think you're fucking with? Cheese comes after the soup! Get over here! Come here! Come here, you bastard! - You're crazy! Stop it! You'll kill him! - There! - Everybody, out! Everybody, out! Death to the screws! Quick! Quick, hurry up! Are you okay? Think you can make it? - I think I've sprained it. Damn it hurts! - Come on. No, it's fine, don't stop. Where is it, exactly? - At Pointe Taillefer! - Taillefer! OK. See? - Wow! How did you know about this? - Rold'Hom gave me the tip when I got out of cell 19. - It's steep! - You got a better idea? Is that Quiberon, over there? - Yes. It looks close, doesn't it? - Oh shit! They're after us already! Come on, we have to go down! Wait! What are you doing? - Wait, stop, you're crazy! Stop! You'll never make it with your leg! - Yes I will! Get a move on! - Wait, come back up, Robert! I'm telling you! Wait, I'm gonna find an easier route! I'll be right back. Robert, it's easier over there! - Loulou! - Robert, are you okay? - No, it's my ankle. - Don't move! Robert? I'm sorry for what I did to you and your mother! You see ... ... I've screwed up my life but ... ... I was never taught anything else. And also, I apologize ... For the trick I played on you. I only thought this up to get you to come here. And to make you listen to me. - You did well. - And the story's not over. There are still about 30 on the run. Catch them and we'll pay what you're owed. There's no justice! I'll get them! Stop! Stop! Don't move! Georges, can you see anything? It's very serious, Madame Guillevec. A real mutiny. We're asking you to cooperate and inform us when you see a child. And there's also a 20 francs reward for each captured child, that's something. - If I see one around here, I'll call you. Excuse me. It's nothing. Just my cat being stupid again. - Good! Sorry to have disturbed you! - It's no trouble. - I'll send a patrol around 6 o'clock. Goodnight, Madame. - Good night, gentlemen. - Good night. Hello Annabelle. - Hello Paul. - Thank you for the tip-off. And Loulou? - He's doing well - And what about you? - I stirred up all of Paris. I even called the Minister in person. He read my article, which will be published tonight. - Really? - Yes, he understood this story might cost him his job. He's coming to Belle-Île tomorrow. With the Director of the Prison Service. - Thank you Loulou, you took care of the fire. - Hello Loulou. Hello, M'sieu'. - I bought him some clothes in town. I said they were for my nephew, visiting from the mainland. - Mrs Guillevec told me what happened. I'm really sorry, you know. - My friend Robert is dead. I've got no one now. If they send me back up there, I'm gonna kill myself. - You don't need to worry now. I'm here, and everything's going to be fine, okay? - I know the colony will take me back. - The colony won't take you back, Loulou. I'll keep you here, with me. This cell is an insult to human dignity. - This is... It has produced very good results, Minister. - Of course. Like corruption, torture, sexual assault. Speaking of which, this Giron? About whom there are accusations of repeated rape. Where is he? I want to see him! - Well ... He passed away. From a violent concussion. - No no no. I have testimonials. A bucket of ice water was poured over him ... ... when he was probably suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis - Yes, correct. Monitor Merlin has been zealous. But he was condemned. - To what? - A 25 francs fine and suspended. As provided in the Regulations - He won't get away with this! I'll have him charged. - Minister. I bear full responsibility. - I want this cell sealed by tonight! Understood? - Villec! When Paris-Soir came out ... ... it caused a stir all over the country. Alexis was not mistaken. People were revolted, moved to tears. They wrote to the newspaper in their thousands. Even Jacques Prévert wrote a poem about it. "La Chasse à l'Enfant." I learned it at school. Of course it was quite a bolt from the blue at the time Suddenly we were no longer good-for-nothings or rascals but ... Poor little colons. Of course Alexis' boss "The Martyrdom of the Child Victims." had insisted on a sensational title. They had papers to sell. But the main story was all there. So the cops arrived at the colony. And this time they weren't after us. The colony was making huge profits on our backs. In the accounts, they found that the bounties paid for our capture ... ... were deducted from our wages. Fouchs was demoted and forced to retire. Pinpin got a 6-year jail sentence. He died in prison, of delirium tremens. Like a dog. And finally, thanks to journalists ... ... I learnt that it wasn't Giron who betrayed us. It was Rold'Hom. It said in the report that he'd received a reward of one franc. And one litre of wine. In accordance with established practice. Bastard! You're gonna die! Bastard! Scumbag! Good bye Loulou. - Good bye. - Annabelle. I stayed with Mrs. Guillevec. She did as she promised. She kept me with her and justice never concerned itself about me. Of course, neither did my mother. I had 6 wonderful years with Madame Guillevec. And then the war came. It sounds stupid to say this, but I missed all the violence and fear. And so, one fine day, I left. Without saying anything. I was 17. When I met your mother ... ... I really wanted to settle down. I loved her, you know. And with her ... ... I've achieved the most beautiful thing of my whole life. You. I was so happy. Until. A bout of depression. Which got me sentenced to 15 years. In prison. I never saw your mother again. Nor you. You shouldn't pity us. You should blame us. We got caught up. What had we done? Children of prison halls. Children of the draughts. The world kicked us out.
