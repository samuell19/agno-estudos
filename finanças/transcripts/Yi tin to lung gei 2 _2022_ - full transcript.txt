Chief. The spy reported that the kung fu masters of the Six Major Sects are all trapped in Wanan Temple. The leaders of the sects are all locked up in this tower. Down there is the power base of King Ruyang. No matter how dangerous it is, we must rescue the people of the Six Major Sects. Someone is trying to escape. Retreat. - Go back. - Let's go. Bat King. Your levitation skill is the best. Come check it out with me. Yes, sir. Grandpa, Emissary Yang, please stand by here with Xiao Zhao. If I need you, I will give you a signal. Yes... Father. My dear. I heard you suffered a setback in the encounter at Wudang. That Zhang Wuji kid was just lucky. If he had showed up a moment later, I would have brought back Zhang Sanfeng. Zhang Wuji was not part of our original plan. That guy isn't all that awesome. If the Xuanming Duo attacks together, we may stand a winning chance. If that's true, then what happened on Mount Wudang? How did Cat and Dog get defeated one after another by Zhang Wuji? The fact that Princess did not bring along the Xuanming Duo for a two-pronged attack is puzzling to me. Minmin, is that true? On Mount Wudang, the Xuanming Duo were escorting Miejue at that time. Master Ku was standing by on my order. I was just about to call for him when that brat Zhang Wuji brought out the Dragon Sabre. What? The Dragon Sabre? Sovereign of the Martial World. The mighty Dragon Sabre was awfully powerful. Being in that brat's hand made it ten times stronger than Miejue's Heavenly Sword. In a few moves, he'd cut off Dog's arm. I was worried that if I asked Master Ku to step in and both of them got hurt that would be a terrible setback for us. So I cut our losses and challenged him to come here to continue the fight. On our home turf, defeating him is a piece of cake. And we have a better chance of seizing the Dragon Sabre at the same time. Legend has it that inside these two weapons hides a big secret. If we can get it, it would be a great accomplishment. Let your daughter get the Dragon Sabre and present it to you. Fine. Ku. Yes. You are Princess Minmin's master. On the mission of seizing the Dragon Sabre and destroying the Ming Cult, you must redouble your efforts. I would complete the mission regardless of hardship. Good. Minmin. You must do your best. I, too, wish to see this Dragon Sabre. Yes, Father. That Cheng Kun dared to speak ill of me to my father and brother. He's got some guts to do a thing like that. Calm down, Princess. Has Cheng Kun brought back the scriptures of "Shaolin's 72 Invincible Skills"? So far, there's still one missing the illustrations for the Indestructible Vajra. He said he couldn't find it anywhere. You can't believe everything this old fox says. Have the other sects given up the secrets of their martial skills? We're close to success with Kunlun, Huashan and Kongtong. Only Wudang and Emei still refused to yield despite death threats. Miejue has refused to eat for three days. She may not last much longer. She has a pupil Zhou Zhiruo, bring her to me. Yes, Princess. Princess. No wonder even Chief Zhang of Ming Sect was willing to take a stab by you and almost lost his life. Sure enough you're an endearing little vixen. I got him only because I caught him off guard. With Zhang Wuji's skills, even if your master tried to catch him off guard, she wouldn't have succeeded. You must have batted your eyes at him to arouse his lecherous heart and had him mesmerized. Nonsense. Emei pupils don't do those things. But it's hard to say. Among the Emei pupils, you are youngest and prettiest. I see your master favours you the most. Perhaps you are her illegitimate daughter. Stop slandering my master. Good, you have some guts. Give her a sword. Spar with them. If you can win three rounds in a row, I will let you go. I have been poisoned. My internal strength is gone. Even if I win by technique, I will still lose. You're only trying to trick me into demonstrating the Emei swordplay. Just kill me if you must. That would be too easy on you. You little vixen, you think you're so pretty that everyone would be captivated by you like Zhang Wuji did. I will use my sword to carve on your face. "Little, Nasty, Woman" those three words. - Who? - Catch them! Chief Zhang. It's been a while. Welcome to Dadu. Sorry I, a humble girl, didn't come to welcome you. Princess, there's no one more powerful than you but the emperor. How can you call yourself humble girl? Maybe demoness is more appropriate. Chief Zhang is always so sneaky, always hiding somewhere, quite unbecoming for a leader. Miss Zhou is my friend, we met when we were kids. A childhood friend. Then of course you must save her. But if anything happens to the rest of the Emei pupils, don't blame me. Chief Zhang, you go ahead. I have to stay here with the Emei Sect as a team. - But... - Princess, I pride myself for having the best levitation skill in the world. You may be guarded by the best fighters and they'll be there for years but not decades. If you put one cut on Miss Zhou's face, I will put two on yours. Your men may not be able to catch me but whenever I think of you, I'll come again and cut you a few more times. I'm a man of my word. You heard Bat King. We'll come back another day. Take care. Master. Go after them. Bat King. The Ming Sect has finally found a leader with supreme martial skills that everyone sincerely admires. I'm Fan Yao, the Right Emissary of the Ming Sect. I've offended the Chief, I deserve punishment. Brother. I knew it was you. Brother. Chief. Right Emissary Fan has been missing for years. He and Yang were called the Carefree Immortals. Our former Chief ordered me to investigate King Ruyang. To my surprise, I ran into Cheng Kun who has sought refuge with the Imperial Court. I snuck into the Palace one night and overheard him trying to convince the King to destroy all the sects in the Central Plains, especially Ming Sect. After destroying Ming, no one else would dare challenge the Imperial Court. To get a clearer picture, I decided to work for King Ruyang, so I could keep a close watch on him. That's why you disfigured your own face. Because only then could I fool Cheng Kun. Bro, you went through so much. The Six Major Sects are poisoned with the Ten Scents Poison from the West. All their internal strengths are lost. Only when their internal strengths are restored, do we stand a chance of saving them. Where is the antidote? Now, the Ten Scents Poison and the antidote are kept by the Xuanming Duo. I wonder what hobbies they might have? One is a lecherous man, the other loves drinking. I have an idea. Years ago, I punished a lewd who molested women. We found on him a bottle of Butterfly Bedazzling Fragrance Powder. It worked like the Ten Scents Poison but its effect only lasts four hours. Wonderful. Brother, it seems we're having the same idea. Who's there? Cheers. Come on... Cheers... The wine is poisoned. You've put the Ten Scents Poison in the wine. You were the one that brought the wine. But you're the keeper of the poison. Never mind, let's get the antidote. Let's go. Little Beauty, did my bro bring you here? Bro... - I took the Ten Scents Poison - Bro. By mistake. Give me the antidote. What are you doing? A beauty in your bed. Having the time of your life and you don't invite me? So you were the one that brought her here. You are trying to set us up. What do you want from us? Inside the tower is the Emei Sect. One of the Emei pupils, Zhou Zhiruo, is my illegitimate daughter. I hope you will give her the antidote and free her. Emei's Zhou Zhiruo is your daughter? And free her mother as well. Who's that? Miejue. All right, I promise but keep Consort Han a secret. No problem. Chief Zhang. I never imagined you would send me a message inviting me to have hotpot and drinks. And I never thought you'd come alone. Aren't you worried I'd take you hostage? I don't know why, but I trust you won't bully a vulnerable woman. Please sit. Shall we ask your little servant girlfriend by the window to join us for a drink? Xiao Zhao. Yes. Be our lookout on the roof, so Princess and I can talk business. Yes, sir. Here, I'll take the first sip for respect. Aren't you afraid it would be poisoned? With your martial skills, do you really need to use poison to kill me? Besides, you have a forgiving heart. The major sects hounded your father to his death. Yet you're still willing to rescue them despite what they did. So why would you poison me? If we were friends and not enemies, how nice it would be. If you would release the captives, then everyone would get along and we would naturally become friends. I have no problem releasing them, as long as you can convince them to pledge allegiance and serve the Imperial government. Impossible. In fact, I came today to convince you not to be an Imperial enemy. Looks like the chances of that has just been eliminated. Sometimes I think... if I were not a princess but a common Han Chinese girl, a civilian like Miss Zhou, perhaps you'd be nicer to me. Who would you say is prettier, Miss Zhou, your little servant girl, or am I prettier? I've never thought about that. You had promised to do three things for me. On Mount Wudang, you did the first thing. Now I want to request the second. What is it? I want to borrow your Dragon Sabre and study it for two hours. Ku must be telling the truth. They had to be mother and daughter, otherwise, why would she speak to her and no one else? Master, are you all right? I heard Zhang Wuji came last night to try to rescue you. Is it true? Yes. But the Princess threatened to kill you and the other Emei pupils, so he didn't take me away. Why did he rescue no one else but only you? You stabbed him at the Bright Peak and almost killed him. I think he likes you. Among the Emei pupils, you are the youngest. But in my mind, you are my only choice to succeed me. I cannot bear to lose you to an evil man's charms. Don't worry, Master. I would never do that. I want you to swear a blood oath. Repeat after me. "Heavens above." "If I, disciple Zhou Zhiruo." Heavens above. If I, disciple Zhou Zhiruo. "Ever falls in love with Zhang Wuji" "or marries him," "my late parents will not have peace in their graves." "My master, Miejue, will become an angry ghost" "and haunt me for life." "If I have children with him," "the boys and their descendants will become slaves;" "the girls and their descendants will become prostitutes." I... Say it. If I... ever fall in love... with Zhang Wuji... or marry him... my late parents... Will not have peace in their graves. My master, Miejue... will become an angry ghost and haunt me for life. If I have children with him, the boys... and their descendants will become slaves; The girls... and their descendants will become prostitutes. Disciple Zhou Zhiruo, take this order... Hey, are you done yet? Soon, wait. This is troublesome, I'm gonna go back and get laid first. I, Emei third generation leader Miejue am passing the iron leadership ring to fourth generation disciple, Zhou Zhiruo. From tonight onwards, Zhou Zhiruo will head Emei Sect. I am young and inexperienced. How can I take on this huge responsibility? Are you violating your Master's orders? I dare not. The leader of Emei must be a superior martial artist. Your fellow disciples are not smart enough. Only you have the aptitude for it. I hereby pass on to you the biggest secret that only Emei leaders are allowed to know. If you can achieve it, you might become the number one martial artist in the world. Secret? The Dragon Sabre and the Heavenly Sword... My beauty, sorry to keep you waiting. Here I come. What do you want? I fear you may frighten my ex-lover. Let me handle this myself. You must never reveal this to anyone else. Or it will be the biggest treachery to Emei and you will be condemned by Heaven and Earth. Yes. I'm Fan Yao, the Right Emissary of the Ming Sect. I'm here to get you out. This is the antidote for the Ten Scents Poison. Take it now. I knew you are a cohort of the Imperial Court. I don't trust you or the Xuanming Duo. You truly are a Sect Leader, I can't fool you. Let me be honest, this is actually the Gut-breaking Corpse-melting Powder. Ingest it and you will die right away. If you won't take it, I will force-feed you. Master... Don't touch her. When the poison kicks in, you will be in great pain. Try to access your internal strength, it might lessen the pain before death. For many years, legend has it that there is a big secret hidden in the Heavenly Sword and the Dragon Sabre. But neither your godfather nor Miejue has found out the secret. Now, I have the Heavenly Sword and you have the Dragon Sabre. With your consent, I'll borrow your Dragon Sabre and examine it for two hours, maybe I will find out the secret, since no one has ever possessed both weapons at the same time. My Godfather lent me the Dragon Sabre for self-defense. Without his consent, I cannot lend it to anyone. I thought requesting this second thing would be easy and you would agree right away. Let's be clear, if you refuse my request, the next one may be even harder than this one. I must get Godfather's approval. What if I add Miss Zhou's life in exchange for it? Of course I'll save her. Fine. In that case, I will join you to find your godfather, then ask for his approval to study it in his presence for two hours. Would that suffice? I need to think about it. I have other things to do. Excuse me. Chief Zhang. When will you give me an answer? Give me one day. No matter what happens tonight, I'll see you here tomorrow night. Emei, Shaolin, Wudang, Kongtong, Huashan and Kunlun have all taken the antidote. Crown Prince, Ku is a spy. He's taken my brother and Consort Han and trapped them in the tower. He wants to save the captives of the Six Major Sects. - Men, burn the tower down. - Yes, sir... Crown Prince, please don't! My brother and Consort Han are still inside! Who cares about one consort? And since the sects refused to serve me, I'll just burn them to death. As for your brother, it's his bad luck. Bro! He really is a traitor. How dare you! Shoot him! All archers get ready. Shoot everyone who comes out of there. What are you doing? Come with us. Leader Miejue, how is your recovery? What do you mean? Ku gave us the antidote. All of us have almost recovered fully. We're going to fight our way out. Go ahead, we'll be right behind you. All right, Brothers, let's fight our way out. - Yes. - Let's go... Hurry! Master, so he really did give us the antidote. Don't be so happy yet. The Cult did us this favour for a reason. Let's recover our strength and see what happens. Be careful, everyone! There's a fire downstairs. Levels One to Three are on fire, and the fire is spreading upwards. Let's go up. - What shall we do? - Go up! - Go up... - All right... Hurry! Go up... Hurry! Wait for me. Have you taken the antidote? What do you want? Ku tricked us all just to rescue you, his ex-lover, and you, his illegitimate daughter. Now that you are freed, please let my brother go. Nonsense! You ruined my reputation! I'll kill you. Listen, all of you, order your soldiers to retreat now or I'll toss them both off. Hurry. - It's so high. - Is everyone here? Miejue is still downstairs. This is too high. Even with the best levitation skills, we'll fall to our deaths. What do we do? It's too high for them to get down. Hurry, find a way to save them. We'll throw them a rope and let them slide down. Give me arrows. Who goes first? - We'll go. - We're first. Shoot! Get inside. Everyone get inside. Stop or I'll kill him. Let my brother go. Minmin, don't worry about me, they... The tower is about to collapse. Grandpa, Emissary Yang. Force Zhao Min's archers - to retreat. - Yes. I'll catch them on the ground with the Grand Diversion. Bat King, help me. Yes. Chief. Wuji... Uncle... Respected Elders. The situation is very dangerous now. Please trust me. I will jump down first and catch you all with the Grand Diversion. Two by two. Great! Chief, I'll go first. Wuji, I trust you. I'll also go first. Then I'll get down now. Jump now! Leader Miejue. - Stop fighting. - Let's go. Zhang Wuji is catching us on the ground - with the Grand Diversion. - Master. - Let's go. - Go. Go. Benny! Are you all right? Yes. Who else is up there? My master and the Xuanming Duo are still up there. Stand back. Let go... Master. Master. Master. Stay away from Zhiruo! Master. Master. Chief. The Five Element Forces have rescued everyone from the Six Major Sects. We shouldn't linger around here any longer. Let's get out of Dadu as soon as we can. - Master. - Emissary Yang, Emissary Fan. Please take Leader Miejue's body with us. Miss Zhou. Chief Zhang. Please release my brother. Bring him out. Yes. Let's go. You useless thing! Father. Do you remember what you told me? To let you handle the martial world problems in the Central Plains and within three months you would make them pledge allegiance. What do we have now? People from the Six Major Sects have been saved and taken away. And it cost me top fighters like the Xuanming Duo. Your Highness, please don't blame Princess. After all, she is still young and impulsive and fell for the charms of the evil Zhang Wuji. She has learned her lesson and will never repeat the mistake. This is between Father and me. You're in no place to intervene. I've decided to hand over the mission of subduing the martial world to Cheng Kun. It's out of your hands now. Finally... you got what you've always wanted. Princess, you're being too emphatic. All I want is to serve the King well and rid the martial world of rebels that go against the Imperial Court. I have no other ambitions. Hand over your commander badge for all armed forces. Minmin. Without my orders, you may not leave Dadu. In just one day, my world fell apart. Yesterday, I was at the top of my glory. Today... I am all alone. Am I that hated? Of course not. I thought you were standing me up. I don't go back on promises to my friends. That means you think of me as your friend. I promised to do three things for you. I should do the second one now. I would like you to come with me to the land of the far north to see my godfather. As long as he agrees, I will lend you the Dragon Sabre. Xie Xun, the Golden Lion King is in the land of the far north? I grew up there. My mom called it Ice Fire Island. Thank you for keeping your word. Take a walk with me. "We're worlds apart." "How can we meet?" "Meeting will be just a sweet dream." "A passion that belonged to me" "was too heavy to bear" "and destined to fail." "Healed scars help the..." You saved me. - Have a candy. - "heartache to fade." - Here. - "But I keep wounding" "myself for you." "Whenever my tears fall like rain," "who would understand?" "All I want is to see your face." This whistle is a secret code of the martial world. Emei Sect. How did you know? Around the time the sects attacked Bright Peak, I spent 3 years researching the codes of all the sects. Their whistle codes and cries for help. Shall we go see what Emei is up to? Perhaps your Miss Zhou will be there. "After we have parted ways." "I no longer understand." Master. I hope your soul in heaven will help us kill Zhang Wuji to avenge you. Sister. Master was killed by the Xuanming Duo, not Chief Zhang. I knew you're having an affair with him. Sister, you can't make slanderous accusations against me. I am honestly innocent of any relationship with any man. If not, Master would never have passed the leadership role to me. Don't throw the leadership word around, I never recognised that. I understand I'm the youngest disciple of the sect. In terms of virtue, reputation and martial skills, I'm not qualified to be the leader. But Master commanded so and I may not disobey her order. Our leader must be the best among us all in martial arts and intelligence. You must at least defeat me before you can qualify yourself for it. This Ding Minjun seems confident about defeating your Miss Zhou. Miss Zhou is in trouble. Call me "good sister" and I'll help you save her. Good sister. You have some good moves. Witch, you dare show yourself? Minjun, the Xuanming Duo are dead and Ku has proved to be a spy for Ming Cult. She no longer has good fighters on her side. Priest, show yourself. They're all worthless, except this one, I couldn't touch her. Zhao Min, what do you want? I was ordered to kill off the rest of the sects. Priest, kill them all! Sisters, run! In fact, I don't have to kill you all. Who is your leader now? Step forward. Before my master passed, she handed down the iron leadership ring to me. Fine. This is the Seven Deadly Bug-and-flower pill. If Leader Zhou will swallow it, I will let all your people go. But deadly bugs will bite and eat your insides for 7 days and nights before you eventually die. Well? Zhiruo, don't take it. We Emei disciples may lose a fight but we will not lose our integrity. Now let them go. Take care of yourself. You're awake. Sect Leader. Why am I on a ship? Where are you taking me? Miss Zhou. Last night, I saw you being bullied by your fellow disciples. But if I showed up to help you, it would cause further misunderstanding. So I asked Miss Zhao to help me hoax them and sent them away. The pill you took is a sedative, not poison. Where are we going now? Ten thousand miles away to get my godfather. If you wish to leave, there are return ships ahead that can bring you home. I have nowhere to go now. I'll go with you. Chief Zhang, you have three beautiful companions on this trip. How lucky you are. Stop teasing me. So you're going to borrow the Dragon Sabre from Xie Xun just to let Miss Zhao look at it. But with both powerful weapons in her hands, aren't you worried what she might do? Even when your master had the Heavenly Sword in her hand, I was still sure I could have the upper hand. Miss Zhao may be bright and witty, but in terms of kung fu, she is still inferior to your master. Don't worry. With you here, I don't worry about anything. The ice rocks are enormous. So beautiful! I never imagined anything like this. What was that? Sounds like the roaring of a wild beast. No. It's Godfather's kung fu, the Lion Roar. Has an enemy entered the place? Godfather. Godfather. Xiao Zhao, Dragon Sabre. Zhang Wuji, catch the sword! Who are you guys? Where is my godfather? They are the Three Emissaries of Ming Sect's Headquarters in the West. Moon, Cloud and Wind. Your godfather lost the fight to them, and is in hiding. He was just using his Lion Roar. If not with his Lion Roar, I think he wouldn't even stand a living chance. And who are you? Head of the Four Ming Guardians, Purple, White, Gold and Green: The Purple-clad Dragon King. I'm the current Chief of Ming Sect, Zhang Wuji. Purple-clad Dragon King, shouldn't you bow to your Sect Chief? I was originally the Guardian Saintess of the Headquarters. Now I have returned to the Headquarters, I don't have to bow to the Chief of Central Ming Sect. What weapon is that? So powerful that can defend against the Heavenly Sword. They are the three Sacred Flame Plaques that Central Ming Sect had lost years ago, forged from special metals from outer space and extremely hard. Give back to me. The Sacred Flame Plaques belonged to the Central Ming Sect. I'll keep this one. Xiao Zhao. Benny. Sorry, but I must obey my mother. They are destroying our ship with cannons. We've lost the Grand Diversion scripture for years. That's why I sent Xiao Zhao to infiltrate Bright Peak to bring back the text. Quite out of my expectation, she only brought back disjointed passages. Chief Zhang. If you can dictate the text and give it to me, I can spare all of you and Xie Xun. Now the Twelve Tree Kings of the Headquarters already knew that you have the Heavenly Sword and the Dragon Sabre. They hope you would give them the two weapons as well. Who are the Twelve Tree Kings? The Ming Headquarters no longer has a Guardian Saintess as its leader, so all sect matters are subject to the group decision by the Twelve Tree Kings. Don't give them. I'm afraid I cannot oblige. No matter how good your martial skills are, you can make no stand against the cannons on my ships. I will give you one day to think about it. Make sure you do that. Xiao Zhao. Let's go. Come. Where is Xie Xun now? I know where. Don't go in yet, he may think we are all his enemy. His Lion Roar skill is most powerful. Get out! Godfather, it's me. I've sent them running. You're Wuji? Yes. I'm Wuji. Do a Lion Roar for me. You are my Wuji! Godfather... Wuji. My Wuji. Wuji. So you are the Sect Chief now, I should bow to you. Godfather, sit down. Please sit. Here, we are father and son. When we return to Bright Peak and in everyone's presence, you may make it up then. Purple-clad Dragon King, her daughter's father must have been Mr Silverleaf. Xiao Zhao was the spy that the Dragon King sent to Bright Peak. Xiao Zhao was the one that translated the content of the Grand Diversion for me. I'm sure she remembers the whole text. She just didn't give the complete version to her mother. Why did she take the Dragon Sabre with her? I don't know. I believe she'll come back. Why? As a woman, I certainly understand, when a woman looks with such passion at a man, how obsessed with him she must be. Every time when she stands behind you, I see her looking at you like that. She will never betray you. Benny. Let go of Xiao Zhao now. Give me the weapons or she dies. Take care of Godfather for me. Now! Give me! Give me the Sacred Flame Plaque first. Lend me the Heavenly Sword. Why can't you unlock her pressure points? The pressure point system of the West is different from that of the Central Plains. Wuji. They're using the most powerful kung fu of the Sacred Flame Plaques, Inferno of the Sacred Flames. If you are hit, you will go up in flames. "For left, aim ahead." "For right, aim behind." "When the sun rises, the moon will move." "When the clouds clear, mist will disperse." "Where 30% is fake, 70% is real." "Where nothing is happening, something will happen." What did you say? Where the weapons hit, they left marks. I'm reading the writings on them. Can this be the external part of the Grand Diversion? Read it to me. "For left, aim ahead." "For right, aim behind." "Where 30% is fake, 70% is real." "Where nothing is happening, something will happen." "When the sun rises, the moon will move." "When the clouds clear, mist will disperse." I get it now. Her life is not in danger. I'll take care of her. Release Xiao Zhao's pressure points. Xiao Zhao. Benny, I'm so sorry. It's all my fault. I'm so relieved you aren't hurt. Everything's fine now. But where do we go from here? I have already seen through the trick of their kung fu. They can't defeat me. Master Xie. Wuji needs your permission to let me look at the Dragon Sabre. I wonder if I have the pleasure of doing that? What do you want with it? Over these past 100 years, you and Miejue have had those weapons the longest time. Clearly you haven't discovered the secret within them. I wonder if it would be easier to decipher the mystery if both weapons were put together? I applaud your insight. I've held the Dragon Sabre for decades, yet never thought of studying it together with the Heavenly Sword. Please also lend me the Heavenly Sword for two hours. Deal. There's no damage at all. Nor to the Sabre either. Where can the secret be? Give it a few more days, I'm sure we'll solve it. Xiao Zhao, come here. - Benny. - Can you understand that? What's wrong? Benny, my mother wants us to surrender. If not, tomorrow morning, she must set herself on fire. Why would she do that? Sect rules state that if the Purple-clad Dragon King Calise, who is the Sect's Guardian Saintess, loses her virginity and renounces her role, then according to Sect rules, she will be punished by being burned to death by the Sacred Flame. Benny, can we go rescue my mother? I'll go with you. Xiao Zhao and I will board the battleship. Please stay along with Godfather and Miss Zhou and protect the two weapons. I'll go with you. I'd feel at ease if you can stay behind to look after Godfather. Then please be careful. Xiao Zhao. Stay back. Mother. Stop. Mother. I've made up my mind. Xiao Zhao. You... Benny. Everything is fine. Why? Chief Zhang. In a short while, Xiao Zhao and I will explain the whole story to you clearly. Why did you change into this outfit? I am now the Guardian Saintess of the Sect's Headquarters. Saintess is a role that only girls from the three major families are eligible for, but a plague wiped out many in this generation. I turned out to be the only eligible one. I have replaced my mother as Chief of the Sect's Western Headquarters. You're doing this because... With me as Chief, my mother will no longer need to be burned to death for her sins. I can dictate the scripture of the Grand Diversion, so the Twelve Tree Kings shouldn't have much to complain about, but I must stay here forever and can never go back. Are you really willing to be the Saintess here? I... I've prepared a ship and supplies to take you back to Central Land. So after you've returned to the Western Headquarters, you can never come back here again? When I return as the Saintess, I must remain a virgin for life. I cannot be in contact with any man and must never leave the main altar. Benny, after this... we will never see each other again. If you are not willing, no one can force you to go there. But I am willing. Whatever is best for you, I am willing to do it, even if it means never seeing you again. Even if it means we'll always be separated. I would be most willing. But... After I've left, you would still have the Princess. She is so intelligent. With her by your side, no one will dare to harm you. And Miss Zhou. She is so sweet and kind. With her company, you will be so happy. While I... in the west... will pray day and night to God, to grant you a life of peace and safety. How is Zhiruo? She is much better, just taking a deep sleep. Xiao Zhao has prepared food and crew for us. We will return to the Central Land tomorrow. They gave us some good food and wines from the west. Come, let's drink. Yes, I've never had a drink with Godfather. Tonight, we shall drink heartily. Yes. Come, another round. Godfather. More. Godfather. Zhao Min. Godfather. Miss Zhou. Miss Zhou. What indeed happened? Zhao Min drugged the wine. You both drank it and collapsed. I was afraid she would hurt you and your godfather, so I pretended to be unconscious. Then she brought us onto the small boat. I saw her taking the Dragon Sabre and the Heavenly Sword with her. She was going to take us back to the Imperial Court to get her reward. So while she was distracted, I jumped into the water and drifted with the current all the way back here. Why did she leave me behind? Maybe she wanted to take your godfather hostage. I should not have trusted her. Are you feeling better now? Much better. Bro Wuji. When I lean on you like this, I'm not afraid of anything. In all the world, you are my only family. Coming here to Ice Fire Island with you, I've had a strange feeling that eventually I'll be yours. Zhang Wuji and Zhou Zhiruo returned to Bright Peak in the boat left by Xiao Zhao. Chief... Everyone. During this trip to the Ice Fire Island, so much had happened in such a short time. Let me help Miss Zhou settle in, then I will tell you all about it. Yes, sir. Bro Wuji. Why aren't you resting? I want to discuss something with you. Our wedding? As soon as possible. It's not that. What is it? When my master passed the leadership ring to me, she also taught me two ultimate skills that only Emei leaders can learn. After practising for a few days, I found that without some substantial internal powers, even if I practised for 20 more years, I will still fail. Bro Wuji, I wonder if your Great Yang Stance could help me break through my limitations. Of course it can. You are so nice to me. I should be nice to you. Later, I will pass my internal powers to you. Let's see if in 7 days, it will clear your Ren and Du pulse points. When I've mastered the skills, I'll go with you to rescue Godfather and get back the Heavenly Sword and the Dragon Sabre. Who are you? Song Qingshu. You betrayed your master and sect, yet you dare show your face. I have my own sect now. No one in the Six Major Sects will dare despise me. Let me show you my powers. Leader... You lied to me. Zhiruo is back. Leader Zhou... Princess, your guess is right. Let the ceremony begin. Wait. Everyone, today is the wedding of our Chief and the Emei Sect Leader. The Princess' arrival makes her our guest. Everyone, for my sake, please be courteous to her. Princess, please take a seat and watch the ceremony. I must say a few words to Chief Zhang. I'll leave after that. Whatever it is, please wait till after the ceremony. By then it would be too late. Please show some self-respect, Miss Zhao. Zhang Wuji. Remember you promised to do three things for me. The first, on Mount Wudang, I forbade you to use skills you knew; The second, I borrowed your Dragon Sabre to study for a while; And the third thing is that today I forbid you to marry Zhou Zhiruo. We agreed that those three things must not violate martial righteousness. If I do not marry her today, I will be violating righteousness. If you marry her, that really would be unrighteous. Do you know where your godfather is now? Where is he? If you marry her, you will never see him again. Wait. I'll go with you. Zhang Wuji, because of this evil woman, you would violate our marriage vows. Zhiruo, I must figure out some things first. Please forgive me. I'll make it up to you later. If you leave today, don't ever come back. Today, Zhang Wuji did me wrong. I, Zhou Zhiruo and Zhang Wuji have broken up forever. Princess. You see? These five finger marks match Song Qingshu's injuries. How do you know this? I rode through the night to get to Wudang. Your uncle Master Yu showed me Song's body. In his skull were five holes. They were amazed that Miss Zhou's martial skills had improved so much overnight. She said before Miejue died, she taught her Emei's ultimate skills. But it required great internal powers, she asked me to help her. So I cleared her Ren and Du pulse points. So gullible. I also find it strange that why Song Qingshu would go to Emei? He was arranged to be a scapegoat. People faithful to the Princess found out that after Zhou Zhiruo left Bright Peak, she sought out Song Qingshu and secretly trained with him for a month. Then they went back to Emei. Song Qingshu had always liked Miss Zhou, plus he was at his last extremities. So she taught him martial skills and begged him to kill Ding Minjun. Of course he agreed. After she used him to kill Ding Minjun, she suddenly turned around and killed him to avenge the death of Ding. Then Miss Zhou's status as Emei's Sect leader would be confirmed. In fact, she was already like that on the Ice Fire Island. She pretended to be injured, stole my Ten Scents Poison and drugged the three of us. Connect the handles of the two weapons by inserting one end into the end of the other. This will work as a key to open up the weapons. Then turn three times each way, and the great secret inside the Dragon Sabre and the Heavenly Sword will reveal itself. "Scripture of the Great Yin" "Scripture of the Great Yin." Master Xie... I used my last breath to escape into the ocean. My pearl hairpin contains the antidote. After I neutralized the poison, I found my way back here and connected with Master Ku to investigate her every move. But what was she practising that gave her all that power within just a month or so? If Master's guess is right, she is practising the Nine Yin White Bone Claw from "Scripture of the Great Yin". Years ago, Mei Chaofeng was eager to learn the skill quickly, so she practised with live people. No wonder. No wonder what? A few days ago, her hands smelled vaguely of rotting corpse. So where is my godfather? He is trapped at Emei. I have to go rescue him. He is being locked in a basement with a thick steel door and only a small hole on top of his head. He gave me the tuft of hair to show you. I was wrong to blame you for this. Sorry. You have let down too many girls. Master. I have fulfilled all your orders. I will use the skills found in the "Scripture of the Great Yin" to glorify Emei. In the beginning, I wanted to disobey you. I wanted to marry Zhang Wuji and thought I could just avoid having children. But now, since he did me wrong, he cannot blame me for what's going to happen. Master, rest in peace. But even if you are resurrected, your martial skills will be inferior to mine now. So, as a ghost, don't try to boss me around any more. Zhang Wuji's betrayal and withdrawal from your marriage was utterly stupid. King Ruyang has handed me the authority of ruling the martial world. Princess had already lost all power even before she went to the Island. Zhang Wuji can get no benefits from her at all. I don't want to know that. But in your heart, you still fail to forget him. I want to dig out his innards and offer them to my late master's spirit in heaven. But you still have Xie Xun in your hand. Since your return from Ice Fire Island, King Ruyang knows everything you have been doing. Your original plan was to first get married, then spend some time to drug Xie Xun into idiocy, and then pretend to rescue him. So your lie would become flawless. That's my business stay out of it. With Xie Xun in your hands, you don't have to worry about Zhang Wuji and the others not coming here. All you need to do is work with me. Organize a Lion-slaughtering Event at Emei. Xie's enemies would all gather here. Zhang Wuji and his men will definitely come to rescue him. Then we can capture them all at once. And what do I get from offending the entire martial world? King Ruyang will make you Imperial Master. You'll rule the martial world and make Zhang Wuji pay for leaving you at the altar. Respected seniors of the martial world, 30 years ago, evil Xie Xun killed innocents arbitrarily, and injured many across all sects. He later escaped and hid in the land of the far north for years. Today, we, Emei Sect, have captured him. I cordially invite all you major sects here to witness this Lion-slaughtering Event. Those with vengeance towards Xie Xun may each slash him once. After he has suffered countless slashes, his head shall be chopped off. Xie Xun is a Guardian Hall Master of the Ming Sect, whoever hurts him makes himself an enemy of the Ming Sect. Master Zhou, I hope on the basis of our alliance, please spare the Lion King and release him. Everyone at Ming Sect would be grateful to you. Does the Ming Sect not have a leader? Aren't you speaking out of turn? Master Zhou. Zhang Wuji is here. I beg you to release my godfather. You can do whatever you want with me. The champion of this tournament may take Xie Xun with him. Godfather. Wuji. Let me take care of this witch. Grandfather. It's the Nine Yin White Bone Claw. Why did you practise such a vicious, evil skill? Since we have come to this, I don't want to keep this secret from you anymore. On Ice Fire Island, I did take Zhao Min's Ten Scents Poison, the Heavenly Sword and the Dragon Sabre. Per Master's wishes, I accessed the secret within them. As of now, we don't owe each other anything. Zhiruo, do not continue to err, I can forgive you. Now it is I who cannot forgive you! Master. Someone has barged into our back hall and killed many disciples. - Watch them. - Yes... - Godfather. - Wuji. Take care of Godfather. You old fox sneaking in through the back door! You're such a fool. Zhiruo. This is... Stop guessing. After I looted Shaolin's library of the 72 Invincible Skills, I handed 71 books to the Princess. I told her I couldn't find the one on the Indestructible Vajra Skill. In fact I kept it, trained hard for a year and have mastered it. Cheng Kun. It's time to settle our score. In terms of offense, I have the two treasured weapons. And in terms of defense, I have the Indestructible Vajra Skill. What do you have to settle the score with me? But it's a good chance for me to pluck up the enemies by the roots. Emissary Yang. No one from the martial world can expect to escape today. Take care of Zhiruo for me. Yes. Zhang Wuji. What other awesome skills do you have? Show them off now. What weird weapons are those? Chief of the Headquarters of Ming Sect The Guardian Saintess has the following command for Central Ming Sect. Chief Zhang Wuji, Purple-clad Dragon King. The Grand Diversion skill has been returned to the Headquarters. So the emblematic treasure of Central Ming Sect the Sacred Flame Plaques should be returned to you. Chief Zhang, the plaques are at your disposal now. Yes, Madam. I don't care about whatever branch or sect, none of you can escape. Arrows! Half of your men are still loyal to me. My Indestructible Vajra skill... Cheng Kun. Your skill has been disabled. Godfather. Cheng Kun. Come on, give me a quick one. I won't kill you. I want you to regret your actions for the rest of your life. Chief. How is she? Zhiruo. Bro Wuji. Can you forgive me? Princess. "We're worlds apart." "How can we meet?" "Meeting will be just a sweet dream." "A passion that belonged to me" "was too heavy to bear" "and destined to fail." "Healed scars help the heartache to fade." "But I keep wounding myself for you." "Whenever my tears fall like rain," "who would understand?" "All I want is to see your face." "Nights of cold winds" "cannot soothe my sadness." "Your smile." Princess is willing to sacrifice everything for you. Do not... fail her. "Stays in the heart." "After we have parted ways," "I no longer understand." Zhiruo. "Old wounds mean nothing to me." "That's why for you I keep wounding myself again." "I wish you will understand me" "and that I will bear any pain only for you." "I just want to see your face." "Nights of cold winds" "cannot soothe my sadness."
