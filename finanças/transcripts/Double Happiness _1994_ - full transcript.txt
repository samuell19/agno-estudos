[Jade] Jade Li monologue, take six. I said I would never make a big deal out of being Chinese. I don't want to make a big deal out of it. I mean, that kind of thing isn't exactly encouraged. But I wanted to tell you about my family, and, uh, they're very Chinese, if you know what I mean. But, for the moment, just forget that they're a Chinese family. Just think of them as any old family, you know, any old, you know, white family. Although, you could probably just turn on a TV set and see that. I grew up wondering why we could never be the Brady Bunch. [speaking Cantonese] The bride's mother usually takes over the arrangements. You know, I read a fact that most women over 22, if they're not married, they never will be. [Jade] What? No way. -[Mrs. Li speaking Cantonese] -What?! -I just said it was a fact... -[Jade] I think she's 22. -Jade, help. -Dad, the word is "fact," not the other word. [Mr. Li speaking Cantonese] OK, OK. It is known that-- [Jade] All right. We got it. [Pearl] Yeah, Jade? No, Mom, I'm not falling for it. Well, "Brady Bunch" never needed subtitles. [music playing] [tool clattering] [sizzling and scraping] [chatter in Cantonese] [doorbell rings] [chatter continues] [doorbell rings] [doorbell rings] [Mrs. Li speaking Cantonese] [woman speaking Cantonese] [overlapping chatter] [music playing] [woman speaking Cantonese] [Jade laughs] Fine, thank you. I have my first big audition for a movie next week. She has real talent, going to be a star. [laughing] [Pearl] Ready? Ready. There are these two peanuts walking down the street, and one of them got a-salted. -Ouch. -Do you get it? -[oil sizzling] -[woman laughs] [Jade] Uh, yeah, I get it. You really get it? -[girl clucking] -Yeah, I really get it, OK? [shrieks] [baby cooing] [man] Hi, Auntie Mar. You guys started without me. Hey. Do you know the Li family? I believe I've only met Mrs. Li at your house, Auntie. [Mrs. Mar] May I present Mr. Li and his beautiful daughter, Jade. [speaking Cantonese] -I'm Jade. -Hi. I'm Pearl. Uh, in a minute. I'll give you a chance to talk behind my back. Goochi goochi goo. He's away on business. [baby crying] He's cute. [chuckles] Aren't you a bit young? Relax. He's yours. Just one of 50 guys Auntie Mar will introduce to you. Get used to it. You're that marrying age. Oh, shut up. [birds chirping] [Southern accent] I was naive then. [waves crashing] -Yes... -[seabirds calling] I can see that now. But I will excuse myself. Yes, I will excuse myself by saying I was only 17... barely a pup in the world of dogs. He was so... He was so kind and charming that, when love struck... that, when love struck, I fell into a deep sleep... and I dreamt this beautiful dream. But then, one day, I woke up. [Pearl] Jade, dinner's ready. I woke up and found myself in the arms of a stranger. [Pearl] I know you're up there! OK. Shut up. I'm coming. -[sighs] -Jade, it's your turn -to set the table! -OK! I'm coming! You don't have to yell! I said I was coming. Winston came by the school today. What is it? He's moving. He wanted to give you and Mom his new number. Well, is he gonna visit? Nope. Rehearsing. [Jade] Wah? Hey, a new TV! No! Only when your uncle comes shall we turn that on. [So Yee] Sit. Watch. [woman] And there you have it. Unfortunately, incarcerating eight teenage boys for a... ...Provincial Courts, this is Linda Taylor Wong for Channel Four. Yes, Mom. Thanks, Mom. Think I'll go steal her job next week. [Quo] Hah-ya. [woman] I'll read all the other lines. [Jade] All right. And... action! "I'd like a burger, hold the ketchup, and a side of fries and a Pepsi. What do you want? I'll have a spinach salad. Ann, come on. You've gotta eat more than that." Anything to drink with that? "Yeah, I'll have a chocolate milkshake. Come on, honey. Have something to drink, at least. I'll have a Diet Pepsi." Would you like gravy with your fries, sir? "Yeah, gravy would be good." And... cut. [camera whirs] Nice. Very, very nice. -So it's Jade, is it? -Yes. Why don't we try something different this time, something with a... bit of swing. Sure. Good. OK, try it with an accent. [French accent] Uh, what kind of accent do you want me to do? A Parisian accent? [clears throat] Excuse me. [Chinese accent] Yes, uh, a very good Chinese accent I can do for you. [train whistle blowing] Did I just get that part? [crossing bell ringing] I think you just got that part. [train whistle blowing] Yes! [bird squawking] [So Yee speaking Cantonese] Mom, Dad, guess what! No, I got good news. I got the part! [Quo speaking Cantonese] No, Dad. I play a waitress. Hah-ya. Yeah, sure, Dad. I'll do that. [Southern accent] Congratulations, my dear, on a job well done. Well, uh, he certainly likes Oriental things. Yeah, it's different, isn't it? I mean, when he's not touring, he takes tai chi down at the community center. Lisa, another rice king. -[laughs] -Is not. [laughs] Oh, I see. Oh, I see. Um... there was just a sale on lanterns at Kmart. You'll meet him at the club. OK. All right, all right. Do you want a drink? [chuckles] Bet you all he has is sake. [laughs] Huh? [Lisa] Congratulations. Thanks. I could live here. [laughing] What?! What? What's so funny? What, in the Oriental love den? [blows] No. I mean... listen. I'd come back from the salon, which I'll own in a few years, and he'd be playing his guitar. I mean, doesn't that sound wonderful? Yeah... but can you seriously see yourself growing old with this person? Who cares? You sound like my mom. You know what I want? A man. [laughs] [blows] Well, how long has it been, huh? Oh, my God. I can't remember. -Uh-oh. -Tell me about it. It's OK. I'll see if Robert's got any friends. Don't worry. I'll survive. Well, then, what is it that you want, Jade? [Jade sighs] To win the Academy Award. [chuckles] And, uh... I get invited to the ceremony. [laughs] Of course. You know, I'd... I'd get nominated for a really dramatic part, you know, something... something really hard and-- and real. I don't know. [laughs] Something that I had to, like... gain weight for. Something. [Jade] Hi, Mom. I'm gonna hang at Jade's today, -OK, so don't wait up. -[Jade] Be back by 1:00. Yeah, she rented some videos. Uh, yeah, some Doris Day videos. [club music thumping] [Jade] Nice. [man retching] [Lisa] Yum. [club chatter] [man] Right on. -Excuse me. -You'll have to wait in line. What line? Section 4.32.7 of the fire regulations, miss. -We've reached capacity-- -Yeah, yeah. OK, OK. [motorcycle engine rumbling] [bouncer] Hey, just in time. [Jade] Uh, what? [sighs] [siren passing] -Hey. -Hey, man. How's it going? Want a smoke? No. Quitting. You'll have to wait in line. Man, what a bunch of losers we got here. We must be full for sure. [clears throat] Um, are you, um... emotionally attached to any, uh... guy? I mean... other than, um, your dad? [chuckles] I-I just had the worst clam chowder of my life over there. D-Do you know clam chowder? [chuckles] Hey, how's it going? -Hey, Cheryl? How you doing? -Hi, guys. How are you? Thanks. They're on the guest list. You going to Bob's tonight? It's always incredible, man, yeah, really good. Do you know "fascist"? So why'd you go in there, then, if the food's so bad? You know, clam chowder? Look, I-I was hungry, OK? I was hungry. OK. [chuckles] [sighs] Do you wanna get out of here? Oh, what? Who, me? Yeah, you. Come on. Well, what do you wanna do? I don't know. Anything. What do you wanna do? I don't know. What do you wanna do? [laughs] I don't know. I... We could go get some clam chowder. No. Anything but that. Anything? Anything. [music playing] No. No way. You are not getting involved. No. [engine grinding] [seabirds calling] Oh, shit. [engine grinding] Listen. This could never work. Thanks. [engine grinding] [car stereo playing pop music] Oh, please. Oh, please. Oh, please. Oh, please. [engine knocking] [engine revs] [engine stops] Shit. Shit. Fuck! [engine grinding, knocking] Shit! [sighs] [So Yee] Jade! Uh-oh. [winch grinding] Where is she? [Quo] What's wrong? Where's Jade? Hi. [Quo speaking Cantonese] Yes, Dad. I'm sorry. Can you understand this wasn't my fault? This is not good. And now you talk back. What would have happened if you got caught? I'm too young to be worried like this. I didn't get caught. All just to hang out with Lisa. Tow truck? Huh. You'll just end up like Winston. Will you calm down? You make him sound like he's dead or something. Might as well be. Winston's disowned, not dead, Pearl. Trust me. It won't happen again. It better not. I promise. Can I have that back, please? [Pearl] Dad's been lecturing me all day. I'm too scared to even show them this. [sighs] Oh, God. Wow. But isn't this bad? What do you mean? It's like lying. [chuckles] So tell the truth. -Thanks. -Yeah, right. Can't believe this is happening to me. Jade, I wanna move out on my own. [chuckles] You know you can't do that. Well, I say disown me. I don't care. I never had a brother, Jade. I'm not neurotic about it like you are. Oh, what would you like me to say? "Fine. Great. Go ahead. Move out. Everything's gonna be OK." Do you want me to bullshit you? You know how I feel. I know you do. Why are you denying it? It's not that simple. It is just that simple, Jade. Just tell me how you feel. Do you like the way things are right now? [faint Chinese music playing] [water sloshes] [Chinese music continues] [music ends] What kind? Red bean. Good. Who's Chiu Chein? Actress. Dad, the penny stocks. [cup clatters] [sighs] Maybe with your uncle's visit, our luck will change. -[cup clatters] -[Quo sighs] [So Yee] They were best friends as children. That's why you have to be very good when he's here, to show that your father has been successful man. Now, long time ago, your father told him that Winston owns his own company and he lives in the States. [laughs] What? Shh. Not so loud. Ma. You know what people think about the actors. Understand? What if he catches us? He will not. Don't worry. Last month, we told Auntie he was in the Yukon. You listen to me about this, all right? Your father has worked very hard to give you a good life. -The least you can do is-- -Lie for him. So, what's Dad, a brain surgeon? Shh. I see your father. -Let's hear it. -Do we have to? We don't have much time. Come on. [repeating Cantonese] [speaking Cantonese] Well, Quo, with me, you don't have to be too formal. Your English... Lessons. I wanted to be understood. [laughs] I'm very pleased to meet you. [laughs] [Ah Hong laughs] [Quo] Ah Hong, you have learned more than the language. I saw it in a movie on the plane. [laughs] -Mom. -Ho la. Quo... Hah-ya. [Ah Hong laughing] [speaking Cantonese] [Ah Hong] Hmm. All A's, hmm? They call it straight A's. Oh. Straight A's? -Yes. -[telephone rings] Hello. [man] Hi. Is Mr. Li in? Dad! The phone! Call me a witch. You're burning a woman for speaking the truth. -You're Mrs. Mar's nephew? -Uh-huh. Yes, of course it is all right, as long as she comes home early. -OK. -You're the lawyer, aren't you? -That's right. -Good. I'll call her to the phone. You can make some arrangements. -Thanks. -[Pearl] I still got an A. Jade! I am alone on Earth, but not in Heaven. [Quo] Jade! What now? God. Who is it? Somebody. -Hello. -Hi. It's Andrew. -Remember me? -Yes. Yes, I remember. I was wondering if you'd like to have dinner with me sometime. Uh, well, um, I don't know. Come on. It'll be fun. How 'bout next weekend? Um, yes. Uh... next weekend is fine. -I'll call. -OK. -Great. -OK. Bye-bye. Bye. -Congratulations. -Hah-ya. Hah-ya. -Hah-ya. -Ho ah. Good. [speaking Cantonese] [Jade] Try another one. What do you call a cow with only two legs? I don't know. What? Lean beef. Don't move. [camera clicks, whirs] Lean beef. Get it. -I give that a three. -Out of five? Out of ten, you loser. [scoffs] OK, ready? So Yee, Ah Hong, get in the picture! -Oh. Ah! Lai-la. Lai-la. -OK. Ah Quo, you are taking a photo of a different man now. In this new country, I'll become a new man. You quit smoking? Uh... [laughs] I know you don't approve. Then allow me to hang this photo in a special place. Ready? [timer buzzing] [speaking Cantonese] -Come on, Dad! -Come on! [thunder crashing] -[yelling] -Oh, jeez! My camera! [overlapping chatter] [all laughing] [laughs] Hey, I have four more! I came prepared. Come on. [muttering] This one. -[thunder crashes] -Ta-da! [laughing] [sighs] Don't worry, Dad. Your luck will change. Your luck has changed, hasn't it? Andrew is a nice fellow, isn't he? Your mother and I approve. Thanks, Dad. You mustn't act the way you do with him. Don't argue so much. Men don't like that. You've gotta be gentle, soft. Are you giving me advice? Of course, I'm give you advice. A father's supposed to watch out for his children, like you'll watch over me someday. Without family at the center... You've got to respect your good fortune, and if you two work out, well... Dad. [speaking Cantonese] -Hmm? -[bell rings] Please. But I just got here. I think he's gonna ask me out. Go to the back or something. -You can finish up later. -[sighs] Are you sure you don't need a chaperone? Shh. [music playing] [train whistle blowing] [man] I won. -[Jade] What? -I, uh-- I jumped farther than you did. -[scoffs] -[chuckles] So what do you want me to do about it, give you a prize? Hey, look, no need to get nasty. I'm not the one that ran out. You feeling guilty? You were sleeping. We were sleeping together. My dad put you up to it, didn't he? Didn't he? Just so that I'd remain the ineffectual goof that I really am. I-I actually thought I was gonna become a confident human being, that a woman like you could find someone like me attractive. [scoffs] Listen, I'm sorry. [sighs] I didn't know what else to do. Look, I wasn't looking, like, for a lifelong commitment, just a phone number, breakfast. Uh, like a cup of instant coffee would have sufficed. I just... [stammers] -[sighs] Listen, Mark. -[music chiming] Can I-- Can I buy you an ice cream? You remember my name. That's nice. [laughs] Normally, in the mating ritual, the two people go out. They-- They talk, um, get to know one another, bowl. [laughs] Th-- Well, that kind of stuff. All I can say is that my life is very complicated. Single mom. Uh-uh. Double mom. [laughs] Well, obviously you deserve to be better treated. -I apologize. -I forgive you. -I gotta go now, Mark. -All right. OK, bye. [sighs] 555-Mark. What? Uh, 555-Mark. That's my number. Uh, call me. 555-Mark. [shoe thumps] Want something to eat? -[telephone rings] -No, thanks. I could make you some tea. Mm. No, thanks. I don't want any. [So Yee sighs] OK, Mom. I'll have some tea. -Yeah? -[telephone line dials] [So Yee speaking Cantonese] Hello. I'm sorry. He's not in right now. May I take a message? Oh, Ma. God. I don't speak Chinese. -[speaking Cantonese] -Speak English. I'm sorry, but you'll just have to speak English. -[dial tone whines] -She doesn't understand me. Winston is living with a white girl. [sighs] All circuits are busy. Thank you for waiting. Your call will be connected as soon as possible. Please hold the line. Please watch over my Winston. Make sure he is eating well and has learned from the past. May he think of me sometimes. And the tomato patch, I was wondering whether I need some fertilizer. [surf rock playing] So what's wrong with Chinese guys? I don't know. What? No, this isn't a joke. I'm serious. Nothing's wrong with Chinese guys. So, why are you so concerned all of a sudden? No reason. I think Lawrence likes me. The paperboy? Yeah. He wants me to go to Nancy's party with him. So, do you like him? Maybe, but he's Chinese. Chinese guys are great. They can be really cool. Look at Andrew. He's cool. [laughs] But you can't dance like that. What's wrong with it? [laughs] Nothing. Show me how. ♪ Pearl's got a boyfriend Pearl's got a boyfriend ♪ Not too loud. Mom might hear. Don't worry about it. She'll love it. He's Chinese. Bump. [laughs] He taught me how to pack a really hard snowball and throw it at any boys that bugged me, and we used to waltz together. I always knew, when it was Christmas and my birthday, that Winston would get me something really huge. One year, it was a four-foot-tall panda bear. I named him Winnie. He can't give me presents anymore. Oh, well. That's life, right? [So Yee] You look wonderful. Thanks, Ma. You think so? Yes, beautiful. Here. I look like Connie Chung. Jade, I want you to have good time. I just want to see you happy. That's all I've ever wanted. Andrew is a nice boy. And your father's very pleased. Andrew has a good future, good income, stability. You know what I mean? And your father doesn't even mind you going out tonight. Mom, don't get carried away. I want you to take this seriously. [Jade sighs] OK, Ma. You're so grown-up. You even remind me of when I first met your father. I was wearing almost the exact same color. Did you date? Hah! No! My parents were so strict, not like me. [chuckles] [Quo] Hey! [both speaking Cantonese] So Yee, come quick! Look! Ah-ya! Doubled! I told you our luck would change. It's such a good fortune. It's all due to your visit. It's all due to the children. New love always brings good luck. -[music playing] -[alarm chirps] [So Yee sighs] [Andrew] Do you know what I mean? [Jade] Yeah, but she's a complete sweetheart. I know, but I can't take any more. I keep on saying to her now, "Auntie Mar, you can't keep getting your heart broken." -Mm. -"Have a little restraint." You know, things have been tough since Uncle died, but this is totally ridiculous. I could have killed the last guy for standing her up like that. Yeah, I know. I just wish I could make her happy. Well, I mean, you're not exactly her type. -[chuckles] -Do you know that she wants you to take over the business someday? Yeah, I know. Well? Well, then, you better let her down easy. She really loves you. Yeah. -Ma'am, are you finished? -Thank you. Well, Andrew, um, please don't take this the wrong way, but-- but my parents put me up to this date. No. Yeah. Well, this wasn't my idea, either. Oh. Well, I was fooled. It's OK. So was I. [laughs] I thought that my parents were one of a kind. Are you kidding? Mine told me what to talk about tonight. [laughs] Yeah, well, my mom did my hair. Well, that explains that. Come on. Let's go for a drink. I know a good bar around the corner. [chuckles] -[overlapping chatter] -[rock-and-roll playing] This is the Chelsea. You've heard of it? Uh, yeah. Andrew, are you trying to tell me something? Disappointed? [chuckles] Devastated. Oh, you... I'm dead serious, a whole year. [laughs] What? I mean, how do you do that? One date, a whole year? OK, well, listen up. OK, for the first two months, they find someone that I'm remotely interested in, and then we go out. And, bang, I screwed up, or I'll say she screwed up. Whatever. We've killed about six months by now, and everyone feels bad for setting me up wrong. And, voilà, a year has gone by. Simple, right? Yeah, it sounds real simple. Jesus! [groans] [laughs] Oh. OK, so it gets a little complicated. Oh, my God. Um... [Jade] Bye, Dad. Hi, Mom. How are you? Do you mean, how did my date go? I didn't want to be nosy. [Jade clears throat] All right. I mean, I-- I really shouldn't complain. What do you mean? What did you do? Nothing. Nothing. Uh... he's fine. He's just not my-- my type. Andrew is a nice boy. He made me pay the bill. -No! -Yes! Wah! Mom, um, don't tell Auntie Mar or anyone. I-I don't want to embarrass him. He made you pay? Huh? He said he lost his wallet. I think we're just friends, Mom. Well, yes, be his friend. [sighs] Maybe, then... he'll introduce you to a nice Chinese boy. Do you think he knows any? Of course. I wouldn't miss it for the world. [woman] So you'll be there at 12:30? -[Jade] Mm-hmm. -[woman] Super. Break a leg. OK. I'll be there. Thank you very much. [dialing] [Mark] Hello. Hey. Is this 555-Mark? Hey, guess what. My agent got me another audition. High-five. [Jade babbles] [Ah Hong] Hah! And he has much respect for you. [laughs] Ah Quo has worked hard. We all appreciate it, don't we? [Pearl] Yes, Mom. [laughs] [Pearl] How many brothers and sisters does he have? One brother, one sister. -[Pearl] Hey, just like me. -[Ah Hong chuckles] I thought he only had a sister. Go get me a bowl. Well, did you used to work together? [Pearl] How come he's not an architect now? Ah, do you think it's possible. We had Jade and Winston both under two years old. And what about the language? All those textbooks just make him feel old. You don't know how lucky you children really are. [Ah Hong chuckles] [line hums] All right, you can come in now. [Pearl laughs] [Quo speaking Cantonese] [laughs] Something you have always loved to do. [line hums] [ballad instrumental playing] [speaking Cantonese] [laughing] [singing in English] [Jade] All right! Yeah! Beautiful! [Pearl] Go, Jade! -[Pearl] Let's party! -[Quo] ♪ Hya! ♪ [Jade] Yeah! [laughs] That's right! So-- [clears throat] Tell me about this guy. Nothing. Ah, he's all right. He's doing his master's in English. And? And nothing. He's funny. And he's really, really nice. It's kind of familiar. Well, he should be. Jesus, Lisa. That's not what I mean. Well, then, what do you mean? [stammers] Not that. [Lisa laughs] They call them a menace to society, a victim of immigration, or just a group of mixed-up teenagers. Whatever you call them, you know them by sight, the Asian youth gang. Tonight's show will profile a day in the life of one such gang member. I'm Jade Li, special host on tonight's "Common Knowledge." Beautiful. Just beautiful. Did anyone ever tell you you look just like that Connie Chung? [laughs] Oh, no. No, that would be a first. -That was terrific. -Thanks. Listen, between you and me, you've got more talent than most of the actors that walk in here. -Really? -Really. But you don't stand a chance. They're looking for Filipino. Oh. All right. I guess that was good practice. Well, listen. I might have something for you. Next week, I'm doing a film with a company from Hong Kong. Oh, I was born there. Excellent. They're looking for Chinese with real acting experience. Now, last time I looked, there were two of you. [laughs] What do you say? [Mark whistling] Guess who. The new host of "Common Knowledge." No. Nope. It's just me. Well, it's-- it's just me, too. [laughs] Are you OK? Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, I-I'm fine. Um... they want to see me again, so I think that means that they like me. Well, she's not the only one. [chuckles] [Jade chuckles] -Ah. -Hey. Ah, you first, please. No, after you. [Jade laughs] -[Mark] OK. -[yelps] [water running] ♪ Everybody was Kung Fu fighting ♪ Huhh! ♪ Those kids were Fast as lightning ♪ Hah! [humming melody] [doorbell rings] Hey. Um, what are you-- What are you doing here? Oh, you forgot this in my car. Oh. Thanks. [folder thumps] Anything wrong? Oh, no. No, nothing. Nothing's wrong. Oh, and you forgot these? [chuckles] Those are for luck. You're not supposed to say that. Break your legs. [laughs] You know, you're obnoxiously sweet. Or maybe I'm sweetly obnoxious. Shit. Mark, get out of here. Leave. Now. He's just a friend. Have you no sense, hmm? Would anyone ever want to take you as a wife? -In my own house? Hmm? -Dad, he's just a friend. -We weren't-- -You know I have a guest. -Dad, please. -[Ah Hong] Quo... let us check on the snow peas. We go inside now. [So Yee] Should we bring in the groceries? We go inside now. [car door shuts] [car engine starts] I bought these for you, your favorite kind... [Quo sighs] [pebble splashes] [pebble splashes] Come on. I'll buy you an ice cream. I can't do this anymore, Mark. Um, I can't-- I can't be with you. Listen, uh... look, I-I... Look, I don't think I heard you correctly, 'cause I thought I was here to console you. You don't understand. I could never hurt them. But you can hurt me, right? Just like that... Just like that first night. I-I should have let you walk away. I... [machinery rumbling] [man] You know, is this place where-- where, uh... -the auditions are for the... -[photographer] That's good. That's good, yeah. [woman] Thanks for coming in. Jade, I'll be with you in a moment. [Jade] OK. [woman 2 ] No, it looks fine the way it is. -[woman 1] Jade is-- -[woman 3 speaking Cantonese] Listen, I promise that you'll like the next one, all right? -[overlapping chatter] -Oh, this'll just take a minute. She's in a really bad mood. Are you OK? Uh, yeah. Just don't let her faze you. She doesn't think that we have any talent here. Shall we prove her wrong? Janet, this is Jade Li. She's one of the most talented Chinese actresses in town. [laughs] Good. Very good, Carmen. Should I give her the sides? 'Course. Um... um, can I have the ones in English? There are no English scripts. But, um... [men conversing in Cantonese] Hi, Ma. Aren't you gonna even ask me how I'm doing? Later. The tea will get cold. [Ah Hong] I have work to do in Hong Kong, or else I would. They would have to kick me out. -No, we would never do that. -[laughs] It was so kind of you to drop by. Well, I wanted to visit before Ah Hong left. Oh, yes, thanks so much for the oranges. No need to be so formal. Jade, do you know Ming? Uh, no, Mrs. Mar. Ming, this is Jade. Jade, Dr. Ming Chu. Pleased to meet you. More tea? Ming just moved into those new office buildings on Pender, his very own practice. How long have you been practicing? -[Mrs. Mar] Two years. -Wow. Your parents must be so proud, eh? [Ming sighs] I thought it was a zit at first. And a side order of fries. [with accent] Would you like glavy with that? -Uh, yeah. -Oh, then it started to swell, and now it's got hairs. Oh, my God. [dramatic music plays] Honey, order something. Oh, I'll have a spinach salad. Better turn it down. [waitress] Anything to drink with that? It's OK. They're upstairs. I don't understand. Where were you? I was the waitress. [Pearl] Hey, that was great, Jade. [sighs] Thanks. And you have that big audition. I already had it. And? And they were looking for a different type. Well, now that you've had enough fun, things can go back to normal. Ma! Maybe you can take that business course at the community center. Mrs. Mar would love it. -She didn't get the part. -Good. Why is the big TV on? Dr. Ming asked about her. He wanted to take your daughter out for dinner. He said something about Tuesday night. Mm. [girl speaking Cantonese] -OK. Bye-bye. -Bye-bye. -[chuckles] -Oh, excuse me, Uncle. I-- I'm still a smoker. Who were you on the phone with? [sighs] My life is very, very complicated, Jade. Well, join the club. When I look at her, I feel whole, but it doesn't make it right. She's much younger than me. She was once my maid. Now we have child together. You have a family? Your father would say this is not a family. To live in this way, I get tired. They don't exist. What? Your family, they're like ghosts, something not even worth talking about. They're ghosts. If I talk about them, I will be the ghost. I never said it was easy. No. [Ah Hong sighs] Sometimes I feel like I'm going to disappear anyway... under the pressure. Choose your path carefully, Jade. Some flowers arrived for you. I brought you some buns. What kind? Red bean. Good. We didn't come here so you could completely ruin your life. We came here to give you opportunities. I know, Dad. From now on, you must seize only the best opportunities. Yes, Dad. And you must listen to me. I know this world better than you, yes? Yes, Dad. By the way, have you thought about courses Ma suggested? I'm just trying to decide. [clock ticking] [Pearl] It's him! [slow-motion music playing] [music playing] [Jade] Could you please stop the car? Go! [rock-and-roll playing] [panting] [Pearl] How long is the flight back? [Ah Hong] Ten hours. [So Yee] Out of the way. [Ah Hong] Wah! [speaking Cantonese] Do you remember the first time you were away, when you pick up Jade from the school? [Quo] She had grown so much in three months. I barely recognized her, and she was my very own daughter. Do you recognize me now? Sometimes. Sometimes, I still get confused. Every day, I blink, every day, I get old, and she gets old. I remember you dressed me up, Mom, but you didn't tell me why. I was wearing that-- that little plaid dress with the bow. [So Yee] And the new black shoes. -Yeah. -[Pearl] Hey, there's a picture of you with that dress on. [Quo laughs] Children find their favorite clothes, never want to take them off. I still think I flew into your arms that day. I-I mean, I was a kid. Do you need me, Dad? -What? Ah Hong... -[Ah Hong] Huh? you've got us all so sentimental. Come on. Let's eat. [Ah Hong] You're supposed to tell her you need her. I gotta go. What is she talking about? Excuse me, please. I'm going to the bathroom. Jade! I'm moving out. After all this... this is what you have to say? I have to. Go. Quo, wait! [clatter] [door closes] [So Yee crying] [door opens] [door closes] You're on a different path now. I know. It's a good one. You think so? Hey, if ever you need me... Is it OK if I take this one? Do you have to go now? You gonna be all right? Yeah, of course. Call you later, OK? OK. I'm not doing this to hurt you. Please, Mom. [sighs] Maybe if-- if we work on him, maybe he'll change. I have lived with him for so many years. I know he can't. Maybe it's because no one has ever asked him to. [So Yee sighs] I'll see you soon, OK? You'll be lucky not to end up on the street. Mom, please. Now... who knows what will happen? [Jade sighs] Listen, Mom. Maybe I like not knowing. Leave the key. But, Dad... You won't need it anymore. Hi. It's Mark. Please leave a message, or, uh, leave a joke. [beep] Hi. It's me. Um, there were these two peanuts walking down the road, and, uh, one of them was a-salted. Hah hah hah. [chuckles] Uh, Lisa and Andrew are gonna come by at around 7:00, so we'll eat first and then paint, OK? I'll see you. Bye. [music playing] [bells pealing] [music playing]
