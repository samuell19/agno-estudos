'Ecstasy' 'Welcome' Telegram Berlin: 'Our most heartfelt congratulations.' The Schmidt Family. Cry, when love broke your heart... Flowers bloom and wither to then grow again, when the sweet song of the birds is heard in the fields and woods. Like a man's love comes back with wanting and regrets, like the blood runs back to the heart, that's how life circulates. Cry, when love broke your heart. Cry, why shouldn't you? And laugh, like youth and beauty do when life still promises joy and happiness. Cry, when love broke your heart. Cry, why shouldn't you? Eva! Eva! Eva! Hello? Dad... Telephone. Telephone? Come. Hello. No. No. What? Yes. Good night. Why did I have to lie? So that I have my peace. So that you have your peace. So that you have your peace... What happened? Nothing, Dad. Nothing?! As if I could hear your mum talk. You still have your whole life ahead. Yes, that's exactly why. Good night. Daddy! I have never understood you, neither you nor your mother. ...Eva Hermann, Defendant, Emil Hermann. Asking for divorce of their marrlage because of unmendable differences.
