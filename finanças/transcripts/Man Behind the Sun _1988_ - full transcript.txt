"Friendship is Friendship, History is History" "Producer FU CH I" "Director T. F. MOUS" "The original site and ruins of Manchu 731 Squadron Residential District, Harbin, China" Prior to the Second World War The Japanese Militarists had occupied N. E. China & established the puppet state Manchoukou In order to expand their Great East Asia Empire The Japanese did a lot of preparatory work Some of the least known work Were the experiments on bacterial weapons The Manchu 731 Squadron Had many sub-sections They were : Helier Sun Wu Lin Kou Mu Dan Jiang And An Da Rural Experimental Station The main offices of 731 Was situated in a residential district of Harbin It covered a large area. The headquarters were heavily guarded It was surrounded by high tension electric fences. Inside were extensive facilities There was an animal farm A crematorium A pathology laboratory, a jail An electrical generating plant The commander's quarters And other sections for various experimental projects In February 1 945 Things weren't going well for the Japanese forces The Central Planning Office recalled A medical doctor Lt. General Ishii Shiro, the inventor of the Ishii Water Purifier Who'd been relieved from duty for corruption To be 731 Squadron Commander At the same time a group of young people were recruited To replace 731 's existing members "The banks of Song Hua River" When will the new people arrive? Commander Takehara's gone to Bai Hua Liao To see the new captain He's been gone for about an hour. Why aren't we allowed to go to Bai Hua Liao? This place is freezing cold . Yes it's similar to Chiba Prefecture I think it's much colder here Ishikawa, don't you think so? It makes no difference We aren't going home anyway Look! Ishikawa already misses home after leaving Mom for a few days. He's just a Momma's boy He even broke down & cried when his mom saw him off But you cried too! No l don't! But my Mom & sister did Yeah my mom cried too I didn't cry But I felt really bad My father was killed fighting in China So was mine! So were my father & elder brother They died fighting in China This kind of food is hard to get back home Do you know that? Drag him out! Yeah! Punch him in! "The original building housing of the Manchu 731 Squadron" General Doctor Ishii's arrived at the H .Q. Would you. . . Yeah l'm coming Sir! Ishikawa Catch the ball! Dr. Ishii! Gen. Kikuchi You still look the same Ishii Our old comrade from 731 Welcome back Ishii Lt. General Ishii's returned to the corps. Idiots! Listen! I'm the new Section Head , Captain Kawasaki From now on you're in the Kwangtung Army Members of the 731 Squadron Youth Corps! If you get the chance to go to Harbin Whether on leave or your day off You must change into civilian clothes before leaving & when you return Put your uniforms back on at Bai Hua Liao If you run into any other Japanese Or if you're stopped by a patrol You will not reveal your secondment to this squadron. Is that clear? Yes Sir! "Crematorium" It's almost 3 years since 1 942 A toast to you and your brother's reunion Cheers! Thank you sir Now Gentlemen I've not been here for the last couple of years But I know all about What has been going on here I've looked into the research done by Mr. Kitano & I think it's been handle wrongly. What we need most now Is to increase the production & the number of bacteria We must use bacterial weapons in the war To speed our victory. A toast to victory! To the Empire. To victory! And to Mr. Ishii for leading 731 ! Cheers! Sir! Lt. General sir. Lt. Onoe Shunji Reporting for duty from the Kwangtung Army commander's officer. Lt. General? I should have been a full general! I don't understand Why those idiots at the Central Planning Office Decided that army doctors cannot go on higher than Lt. General It's ridiculous Lt. Onoe! I've just made a criticism against the Central Planning Office Would you inform on me? Stop! Have you no respect for your seniors? Forget it, go back! You'll be in trouble if you're discovered. I can't! My brother gave me that ball when l left Japan. Get up! Out of your beds! Where's Hoshino and Ishikawa? I don't know. I don't either One. . . where's he gone to? I don't know! "Animal Farm" Hoshino! Don't run! Hoshino! That was. . . totally undisciplined It must never be repeated The training of the Youth Corps is important. It's not only because we're short of staff It's also because what we require here. Are people of the highest integrity. The Central Office only see the importance Of bacterial weapons in this war. They fail to realise that biological & chemical weapons Will greatly affect the future of Japan. They wiIl play a very important role. So we must work doubly hard on these experiments. Yes sir! That really was unexpected. We have to step up security and discipline It's late. l'd better leave you two to talk! Brother, sit down Shiro What's happening back in Chiba Prefecture? But people are managing. People have suffered a lot these last few years. There's shortage of everything. We can only do our best brother. Yes. How are things here? What about the men's morale? Not too bad Things are alright. Also. . . we confirmed that the incident Which got you relieved. Was due to an informer. It was Lt. Colonel Nakatome who reported you. He even ridiculed the effectiveness of your water purifier. Nakatome! Goddamn him! Attention! Nakatome! Lt. Colone! Nakatome, present! Here sir! Lt. Gen. Ishii wants you . . . Kawasaki , any absentees? Unfortunately We had an accident just now. I want you to treat those kids from Chiba gently. They are important to us. Thank you. Yes. Damn you! Hoshino brought about his own death. And you're all acting like a bunch of school girls. What kind of soldiers are you? How can you gain honor for Chiba like this? Soldiers shouldn't act like this! Close ranks. Quick! Forward! Everybody down, prone position, crawl! Quick march! Quick! Asshole Quick! Attention! I heard that the fighting are very heavy on the southern front Our whole army could possibly be wiped out! It sounds serious We have to push our people To speed up the experiments on the marut. Let's go! These biological weapons Let's go! Are the only way to turn the war in our favour. What did they say? It sounded like little Japan is finished ! Let's go! Wait! Sir, please! Give me back my baby! My son. . . Lt. General sir. . . Aren't we supposed to conserve the maruts? This one can be stuffed and mounted, it won't be wasted. "February 29, 1 945 Victim : Zhao Qing, Han Chinese, 3 months old" Oh water! Water's coming out! It's really tough . Thank god the money's alright. Also I can study. Do you send money home? No. Come on you spend it all every month! No, mom said I must save it for the war efforts This is a nice place. It's similar to Chiba Prefecture. Chiba's not as cold This is like a hospital I say it's not We only have dead bodies here Hospitals should have patients This is more like a medical school! Not like medical school They don't have soldiers everywhere And they're not heavily guarded. Anyway this is fine by me I eat well and I can make money Only thing is that fat captain He's too much! He's always looking for trouble. Yes, Yes. Look! Isn't that Hoshino's ball? Get it back! Come on let's get it back Let's get it back! Stop! There's nowhere to run! Give the ball back to us! There's nowhere to run to! This isn't Hoshino's ball. Who are you? What are you doing here? He's a mute! HoId on a minute! Sir! What's wrong with him? He's been here for over a month But he's still not adjusted to the place yet. He vomits every time he goes to work. When it happens We have to let him take a break It'll take him a while to get used to it. This is nothing he'll soon get used to it. His job is important. We reply on the colours to determine the results of the experiments We can't depend totally on black and white pictures. Look after him see that he works well. Yes sir! Sir! Lt. Col. Nakatome Jiro. I've been transferred to the southern front by order of the Kwangtung Army Commander I'd like to say goodbye sir. Congratulations The situation in the south is serious. A patriotic soldier like you. Should be able to achieve a lot there. Especially as you have a close relationship with the planning office You can do a lot for the war effort! Yes sir! This must be your arrangement. "March 2, 1 945, Pathology Laboratory Victim : Zhang Shulin, Manchurian, 26 years old" This marut Has been injected with "Black Death Virus" But nothing's developed yet So now let's dissect him And see what we can find inside the body. Right! The correct data ReIies on continuous tests on experimental subjects So these maruts Not only have to be alive But they also have to be fit and healthy. Experimenting on living bodies Is a rare opportunity. Yes sir What is this? It's a man. What is this? He's a Chinese man. What is this? Sir He's a bad Chinese man! This is a marut. It's a log for the fire or making coffins It's material for experiments. It's called a "Marut". What is this? This is a marut! What is this? A marut! What is this? Marut! What is this? Marut! Go ahead! We must try to get evidence And get it out of here So the outside world knows what's going on here. It is the only thing we can do! Look, why bother? say we have no chance of getting out here! You chicken! You have no back-bone! and you. . . Iearn to be a man . Don't copy him. You don't act like a Chinese! "Bayonet Practice Ground" Put your guns down! ReIax! The lesson on experiments will start tomorrow. So work hard men, and learn well Is that clear? Yes sir! Let's go! Sir, please! Iet her carry it away its her baby! Please sir! "Bacteria Extermination Room" Quickly change your clothes! Hurry up! Let's go! "March 9, 1 945 Outdoor Frostbite Experimental Station" "Victim : Zhao Huixiu, Han Chinese, 24 years old" - "Bacteria Breeding Room" - Look, this is the "gene" production room . This is the high temperature bacteria extermination room . Look this way please. This is the bacteria transplants. You must study hard and learn all this as soon as possible. Yes sir! "Frostbite Experimental Room" This is the cold treatment station At -35ºC for 1 0 hours Cold Treatment. Water temperature 1 5ºC "March 9, 1 945 Victim : Jin Yuanlong, Manchurian, 31 years old" What you're looking at now. Is a quick freezing station, it's -1 96ºC Don't move Finish your apple And spit it out like I do. Don't swallow it This way you can CoIlect the germs from the mouth. Yes sir. Go back and tell your captain. That you'll be my guests this Sunday. We'll have a drink together. Yes sir. And you'll come too, O. K.? Right! Thank you. This is a question of humanity. No! This concerns the rise or fall of the Great Japanese Empire. Listen Ishikawa, they're human beings too They have parents just like you! What are you talking about? Give me better justification than that! Today is Sunday Let's not talk about business Come on let's eat up. This fruit is specially brought over from Japan. HeIp yourselves. Let me, you must look after your health. Thank you. Take Mrs. Takamura for example, what's the difference between the children she bore & the maruts? What are you talking about? That's not right! You can not compare the maruts to the Japanese, you & I speak a different language. Please don't say anymore I 'm sorry, please excuse me. Ishikawa, wait! Ishikawa, lshikawa! Ishikawa. . . Kawasaki pushed him . . . from upstairs! He's badly hurt Iets think of a way to teach Kawasaki a lesson. I hope you'll work well together. Yes Iets think of a way to teach Kawasaki a lesson. we should . . . obey the regulations. I think you'd better forget about it. Don't pretend now, you have no guts. Coward. Stop pretending! "April 1 1 , 1 945 Inoculation of bubonic plague into living victim" "Victims : Names unknown, 1 5 males and females" Those goddamned Japs. . . What the hell are they up to? Hey Specs! What do you think the Japs will do to us? What did they inject into us this morning? I have no reaction at all! I have no idea what it was. Why didn't those people get it too? Let's go Be careful of contamination! The last accident cost Sakagami & Ohtani their lives So be careful everyone First give those people an injection, quick Sir, according to the previous test results it would be a rather difficult job to produce a Black Death Virus that is 60 times stronger Is difficult Nowthis is the 7th experiment here is the record for the last fewtests! Sir, l 've heard the Germans are using the Jews to perform simiIar kinds of tests and they've achieved good results So can't we. . . Dr. Ishii did 2 years research on this in Europe before the war. According to him, the German researches into that area are fare behind ours. Compared to this, their equipment & facilities are fare behind ours What they achieved so far may not be of any use for us. Don't be discouraged, keep up the good work Report to me at once when the experiments are completed. Yes sir died in action on the southern front, is that right? Dr. Ishii may have been too. . . We'd better keep out of that You'd better concentrate on your own career. The Empire Medical Department is waiting for your return. The medical future of Japan. . . relies on your people. "Early summer 1 945 Japanese were retreating from the Pacific Field" "They also suffered many losses in China" "The morale of the Japanese troops was very low" "All of Japan had been mobilized, but there were still great shortages of everything" "Large deficit of manpower for the Japanese Forces, resulted in more adolescents joining the military" "The cloud of defeat loomed larger" This is the present situation In order words the success and failure of 731 Decides the survival of Japan . So today. . . . . . We should have no more illusions about the Kwantung Army. The Kwantung Army. . . now relies on our bacterial war. There's no other way of winning it. I've always thought that biological chemical weapons. Are more effective than bombers and guns. Right now we must re-group our forces. And mobilize them . I entreat you to work doubly hard. We must get ourselves well prepared For the coming bacterial war. Gentlemen, do you have any questions? Please go ahead! We have already successfully produced A large quantity of virus which is 60 times stronger than the Black Death Virus. The amount we have According to our calculations Has enough power to wipe out the whole of mankind. At the same time. We have increased the number Of bacteria carrying rats to 3 milIion And jumping fleas to 300 kilos. The number is estimated at 1 0 billion. If this 1 0 billion bacteria carrying fleas. Were all released, then it's not hard to imagine. The situation on the war front would be changed drastically. We would gain the final victory! Because of our bacterial weapons The fate of the Great Japanese Empire Lies in our hands. Still after numerous experiments The metal shell casings holding the bacteria Get very hot during firing. Due to this a great number of fleas inside. Do get killed . Therefore the shell's effectiveness is greatly reduced So these bacterial bombs. Have failed to produce the expected results. Engineering! Attend to it. Anything else? Sir, there's been a strong reaction to the incident When Kawasaki assaulted the Youth Corp member And it's getting to be quite serious. There's a lot of tension and unrest amongst the Corps. Transfer Kawasaki from the Youth Corps. Onoe you'll replace him . Sir! "Sukizan Geisha House" Sorry to disturb you General, it seems your sword's not rusty yet! Get out all of you! Yes! Come let me disinfect you! Whoever. . . was hit or touched by the chess pieces, raise your hands. Gentlemen This is. . . my new invention. This. . . is called Low Temperature Pottery. . . Bacterial Bomb! The Great Japan will not be defeated! Careful! Don't break the pottery bomb! "May 22, 1 945 An Da Rural Experimental Station" "Victims : Names unknown, 29 male and females" Hurry up Ishikawa! "May 29, 1 945 Decompression Laboratory" Get inside! "Victim : Qu Hua, Han Chinese, 34 years old" We don't want the women Kawasaki , l want you to bring me a healthy young man. A young man's no use to you! That's no use to you But it's of great use to us. You have to help us get one. Kawasaki , If you can help us find a healthy young man, Then I'll buy you a drink. Right, we'll all buy you a drink. Kawaasaki's good at that. I'm sorry, I can't help you with that. Kawasaki's only good at finding girls! That's nonsense! Come on Kawasaki ! Do something for us. We'll reward you! Please! OK then l'll give it a go. - "June 1 2, 1 945, Poison Gas Laboratory" - Please let my daughter go. - "Victims :" - She is just a little girl.

You've been here a while, are you used to it? Yes I am sir! Well that's life in the army! Do you still see that Chinese mute? Not often sir! Do you think you can find him for me? What for sir? Sir, l've brought the mute. Thank you, welI done. Come Don't be afraid ! Come Let him in. Yes sir. Come here Come inside. You wait here lshikawa. When the surgery is finished You can take him away. Surgery? What surgery? No questions! Keep your nose out of these things. Yes sir. "Pathology Lab" Come here! Go on! This boy looks good Come here! Not bad. Where are you going? You have to take him away after the surgery, quick! Yes sir! Are you satisfied now? Yes! You have the heart And the liver And the brain that you wanted! Yes These living organs from a young man in puberty Are difficult to come by. We should thank Kawasaki . Don't mention it! We'll give you a treat this evening. Thank you, thank you. What's up? Move the car quick! Yes sir. "July 2, 1 945 Victim : A mute, name unknown, Han Chinese" "'Red Tunnel' connecting Pathology Lab to the Crematorium" Makimura, draw the curtains That fat ass is a barbarian. Come here Come That mute was not a marut. That animal has gone too far! Yeah, l've always detested him. Let's find a way to fix him. What'd you think? I'll kill him Leave him to me! No! We're all in this together. Yes, we're all in this! Hurry it up. Ready for disinfection! What're you doing here? Get back! A rat can beat a cat. Fleas & germs can defeat bombers and guns too! This is. . . the theory behind 731 squadron. It is also my philosophy. For victory We shall groom the strongest and nurture them. The same applies to the Youth Corps. Understand? Yes sir! Stone, stone! Stone Wait! You must get out of here alive! No matter what happens We must get the evidence out! Stone, quick! ReIease him! Get in the hole you bastard! Stone won't follow a coward like you. . . Stone won't go into anything blindly with you The door is open! Stone, quick! Fire! Charge, charge! Fire! Idiots! So many maruts are dead This is a serious matter. Do you realize you job Is to keep them in good shape So they can live longer. But you neglected your duties With very serious consequences. Your error is intolerable And unforgivable. Maruts are precious experimental material. They mean more to us now than ever. You have no rights to kill them. The Russo-Japanese war is coming. But many of our experiments. Have not been completed yet. The 731 Squadron is our nation's hope. We hold the power to turn the war in our favour and save Japan. Get up now! I hope you won't forget. That I was the one who brought you here from Chiba. You are the heart of 731 . Takamura at An Da Rural Experimental Station. Is preparing for the final pottery shell tests. Have the maruts gone yet? They left early this morning sir. Specs said , that what you did was stupid. We can't get out of here anyway. The more we resist, the faster we get killed . He said the only thing we can do is to try & get the evidence out. So the world will know about this hell hole. That is the only way to take revenge. Dr. Ishii, we're running out of time The situation at the front is not good. Looks like this is the final straw for us. The trip to Feng Tian. Is very important, don't worry about things here. Thank you, I reIy on you. Report sir! Inform the air corps to take off now! Preparations are complete at the shell test site. The system is down. . . we haven't contacted them yet. Right. . . Let's go to the upper. Yes sir Fire the signal! Let's move! Yes sir We need the maruts urgently. Are they on their way or not! Sir! Excuse me sir, urgent telegram. You may go. Sir! August 9th. Makasaki was bombed . The Russians have officially declared war. Manchuria 731 Sqdn. Retreat if necessary. Go to Feng Tian get the commander here. Yes sir! Stop the delivery of maruts. HeIlo. . . HeIlo! Airport. Sir! The maruts have escaped. Go after them, don't let them get away. Get in the car quick! After the way. Run Run, split out! Quick! Hurry up! We must get the evidence out! I know Run, quick! Stone, go that way, quick! ! Quickly, run! "Augest 1 945, Porcelain Bacterial Bomb Experiment Victims : Names unknown, 35 males" Cover him! Put him down here. Sorry to disturb you . Yes sir Urgent telegram sir! Yes sir Nakasaki was bombed. The Russians have officially declared war. The Kwangtung Army HQ. Order all troops to retreat if necessary. Are you going back sir? The Russians have declared war? All troops to retreat? What do we do sir? Gentlemen Hiroshima and Nakasaki have been bombed by the Americans. The cities have been completely destroyed . Now the Russians have declared war on us. Our fate has been sealed. We've received orders to retreat. But I personally think That the work of the 731 Sqdn. Involves top security information. So I'm now requesting the following 1 ) Exterminate all remaining maruts And destroy this whole facility. The engineers will be in charge of that The place must be flattened, I want no traces left. 2) Collect all data and documents Destroy them at once. 3) The Youth corps is to retreat to Tung Hwa 4) All units will commit suicide. 5) Their families and dependants Are also to commit suicide. In other words all evidence must be destroyed. Dr. Ishii Our squadron has a lot of highly qualified people Isn't it a waste to order them to die? We shouldn't allow such meaningless sacrifices. I realize that too Gen . Kikuchi But we have to guard the secret of this place. Dr. Ishii, if. . . You commit suicide, then I'll join you. These soldiers & their families have followed you From Japan to Manchuria. You should at least Get them back home. Isn't that reasonable? As the head of 731 You're responsible for them. You should be protecting them . Not ordering them to die! I hope you'll face up. To your responsibilities. Gen. Kikuchi is right. We should return to our home land And we should take all the data with us. Your point is valid. But we must still prepare for the possibility of being captured. No matter what We can't allow these secrets to be made known. How about this? We issue each one with a bottle of cyanide. If anyone's captured, then they Commit suicide. OK then That's what we'll do! I will bring up the rear. And arrange for transport. I'm very happy you've made this decision I'm sure everybody's grateful to you . What are you doing? These are our children's clothes! the data is important. Anyone home? Please take this with you madame! It's the commander's orders. You must take it if you are captured . Mr. Takamura prepared them . Where are you going at this time? To get more data! The war's over and we're going home! What's the point in taking data back with you? Shut up! What do you know! I don't care about anything else All I know is that we can go home! You're a woman you know nothing! Yes I may know nothing. And I certainly don't know how to make poison! How dare you speak to me like that! Takamura! Takamura! This is important data We cannot destroy it! Anyone tries to burn anymore. . . Takamura! I just want to go home! I ask nothing else from you! I just want us to go back to Japan! That is all l want, Takamura! Don't burn it or I'll kill you, l mean it! Burn it! Burn it all! Sir. . . Takamura! This is an order, burn it all! I don't want a single piece left. Sir. . . You can't destroy this data! This is the whole reason for our being here! It represents years of hard work! We've sacrificed a great deal for this research. And Japan will need it one day! If you want to destroy it kill me first! Thank you sir! Poison gas! Retreat! Quick! Hasegawa, Miki , come up quick! Miki, go up! Hurry up! It's platinum, it's worth a lot of money. Hurry up! Tshikawa! This place is blowing up, retreat! Quick, retreat! Retreat! Come on, let's go, quick! This place is blowing up! Find shelter! "August 1 5, 1 945" Where are you going? Get back! I'm sorry Quick! Don't run! HoId on madame! Madame! HoId on! Sir, Mrs. Takamura is going into labour! Can she get in the car? Dr. Ishii's personal data are in the car She can't! Sir, we're leaving in 5 minutes. Do you want to check the squadron again? Aalright Salute! Gentlemen! This is just a change in strategy. The Great Japanese Empire. Has still not been defeated. Our base has been destroyed But our careers will continue. Now you're all going back to Japan. I trust you will safe guard the secrets of this base. And always remember this No contact is allowed between squadron members And under no circumstances will you reveal the nature of your work here. You are disbarred from taking up government posts. Anyone who contravenes these conditions will be severely punished. For the future of the Japanese people. Who is he? Who is he? Are you the one who brought him here? No. l did not. He is a young marut. Madame! Madame! Madame!
