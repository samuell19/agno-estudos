Our father who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name... THE FAMILY FRIEND Cheapskate, Saverio. Cheapskate! I'm not letting my niece come off as a cheapskate. You already refused my sister a honeymoon. You want to see your daughter unhappy, too? His family paid for the house, furniture, honeymoon, photographer, video, the rings and the cake. You get the reception, wedding favours and the dress. Got that? This is Michelini's quote. It's the cheapest one. Seafood starter, the chef's special linguine... - With scampi. - Or penne alla vodka. The second course is fried calamari and shrimp... - All fresh! No frozen shit. - Fresh. Salad, eggplant marinara and coffee. All for 15 euros. That's still expensive. There's no cheaper option? Sure! Spaghetti bolognaise at your house! How much do you want to spend? There are 200 guests, times 15 euros... That's 3,000 euros, plus wine, wedding favours and the dress. I can't afford it. Come and change my bedpan! Get a maid! Change the bedpan, it stinks! Number one or number two? Two! Sweetheart! I've only got a few minutes, it's Armando and Rina's wedding. I'm a bridesmaid, of course. Have a seat! - I want your picture up here, too. - Let's hope this is it. If I fix you up, I'll change jobs. - Why? - It'd be like winning a Nobel Prize! There'd be no challenge left. Okay, Belana is from Romania. From Bucharest, the capital. You get my point? She just came to Italy, she's 22. She's a widow and I totally recommend her. She's sweet, a good girl. Docile and helpful. Go for a walk, get to know each other, show her the house, take her out for a pizza, maybe even a film, then escort her home. She's staying with two girlfriends, they're cleaners. Then sleep on it and decide in the morning. - What do you think? - She doesn't speak Italian. You know my tool of seduction is my charming manner of speech. Your tool of seduction, Geremia, is called hope, and if you're religious, prayer! What does she want? She wants to know what you did to your arm. My arm? Nothing... Nothing serious. Nothing serious. My house. Mother sleeps there, and that's the kitchen. There's a bathroom, too. The barometer doesn't work. The floor is new. Gigi. A potato headband, an old-fashioned remedy for headaches. My father. He left Mother when I was 9 and I never saw him again. He started a new life in Rome. Mother says he's phenomenal at his job. We're both in the same line of work. He sent me this picture a few years ago. On the back he wrote, "Darwin's theory in fast-forward, these are your brothers." I don't exist for him. And he doesn't exist for me. That's how we get along. Mother says she won't give up the big bed. So... I was thinking, if we get rid of the shoe closet we can put a folding bed next to me, for you. Anyway, this is home. Do you like it? - Water. - Of course. Dear heart, I must be frank, even if it's against my own interests. You're a beauty, you don't need anything. I need cocktails and Saturday nights out with young people. Saturday nights no longer belong to us, they belong to the smooth of skin. And love? We all have the right to love. Love is no longer a cure, now everyone's at it. - Will you help me? - Are you sure? - Absolutely. - I don't understand you, dear heart. Someone like me would marry you just as you are. Someone like you, exactly. So will you help me? In 7 days, Geremia Heart-of-Gold will give you his answer. - On the 8th I'll go to the Pirate. - Why would you do such a thing? You're a good person, he's a bad person. - I can't waste any more time. - I know. Not only don't you want to waste it, you want to change it! Has little Mattia's fever passed? - No, it's still 39.5. - I'll send Coppola over. - Best doctor in town. - Don't go out of your way. What are friends for? And he owes me a favour. Two, actually. What should I do with you? You have old-fashioned decency. You're making me uneasy. Put the beast on the sofa. We wanted to thank you, sir. Don't call me sir, I'm just a simple artisan. - Forever your servants. - Servants no longer exist! Democracy has swept away good habits. - Democracy's great... - Let's say, the problem with democracy is that anyone can vote. I read that in Reader's Digest. - How's the baby coming along? - She's fine, thanks. I have a genuine passion for that little girl. - We started weaning her. - What a wonderful moment! Weaning is the first step to the restaurant. And remember one important thing... My last thought will be for you. And my very last one, for you! Dear heart! There's this Tiziana Senatore in Via Manzoni, 19. Check her out. Geremia. Are we going tonight? I can't. Mother's filthy. Just this one little sweet. I even have the loyalty card. You have to spend at least 100 euros. So there's no discount on this? I'm afraid not. You have to agree it's a bit of a swindle. - You can just have the sweet. - That's very kind. Thank you. A nun brought me this. We need to buy a water jug. She had a backache. Because of the humidity. I wonder where she stole it from. - Mother, nuns don't steal. - Everyone steals. And everyone's unhappy. Everyone. I apologise for the seats on behalf of the organisers, but our sponsor backed out at the last minute. Too bad for him. We've reached the highlight of the evening. The new Miss Agro Pontino is: Rosalba De Luca! As promised, a cheque for 500 euros, straight from the hands of the manager of the County Savings Bank! Your parents wrote on the application form that there's one thing you can do best. What Rosalba can do best is dance! He gets involved at every step, he's concerned about you, he listens to your problems. If he's in a good mood, he'll turn a blind eye to lateness. He's like a family friend. - Is that good or bad? - Both. He's there when you need him, but also when you don't. But you're recommending him. Is he human? Too human. Short-tempered, stingy, fake, vengeful, talkative... And extremely hideous. He smells foul, he sweats profusely. - What's his name? - Geremia De Geremei. But everyone calls him Geremia Heart-of-Gold. He really likes to think he has a kind heart. How much does he charge? Double the loan if you pay on time, or else triple. You pay in instalments based on your income. What if you lie? If you think you can screw this guy, you're wrong. They're sharks, and who do you think you are? He finds out everything about you before the loan. If you have prostate problems, he knows. He checks personally? If you have prostate problems, you have medical bills. If you have medical bills, you can't pay him. You're no longer an investment and he won't lend you money. And if you don't pay? These are Chiquita bananas. The most expensive sort. If there's one thing I can't stand, it's threatening good people like you. Those hams don't do the trick any more. 6,000 euros overdue, my friends. That's irresponsible. - It was a baptism present. - Baptisms are pointless. This isn't fair. I made your dreams come true and that's fair, but you wake up from dreams and that's fair, too. Where's the kitchen? A mosquito. This whole area was a swamp before Mussolini. But the mosquitoes stayed. Get an insect killer, at least for the baby. This is very versatile, it makes a lot of dishes, right? I wanted to get one for Mother, but it costs 900 euros! Straight to the poorhouse! - Any other valuables? - No. Goodbye. What? A fuse blew. When human beings are at ease, they tend to put their hands in their pockets. I read that in Reader's Digest. Psychology section. Hands in pockets indicate nonchalance, but I see very little sign of nonchalance here. You've already found what you're looking for. Dear heart, my last thought will be for you. Why does a 53-year-old man dress like such an idiot? Country and Western... How can I explain? It's my whole life. You have a restricted view on life, dear heart. That Tiziana Senatore, she's safe. She gets 500 euros disability. She fakes it, but she gets the money. What does her brother do? He makes go-karts, he's successful. - The world is full of morons. - What does she want the money for? She thinks giving my money to a surgeon will freshen her up. "As fresh as a watermelon," she says. But I told her, I said, "Dear heart, watermelons don't exist. "It's an illusion, just water." What did she say? "Watermelons taste good, water is tasteless." So I shut up. How's your bar doing? One of these days I'll be able to leave. Still dreaming about Tennessee. - Switch places. - All right. Listen, Geremia. I have a question to ask you. In your opinion, are we friends? It's an eventuality I never really thought about. Sir, can the child have a chocolate? Chocolate? Who's got chocolate? Here, go and buy a sweet at the shop. - What did you do to your arm? - How can I help you? I have health problems. Soon I'll be dead. My only hope is to go to Paris for an operation. - How much do you need? - 9,000. - What guarantee do you have? - My husband's pension. It isn't much, I can pay 50 euros a month. I'll die before you finish the repayments. I could ask that ungrateful son of mine to sell his bonds. - How much does he have? - 15,000 I think. - We can persuade him. - You won't hurt him? Geremia Heart-of-Gold does only good for the needy. Are you in a lot of pain? The morphine doesn't work any more. I'm going to do something crazy. I'll give you 9,000 right now. You probably want to talk money now. - It's an addiction. - What? China... It's an addiction. Someone gives you a statuette and that's it. An irresistible impulse goes off and you can't stop. You have them, too? God, no! The nice ones cost a fortune. These aren't worth a cent. Dear heart, hospitality personified! - So lovely! - Thank you. - Madam. - Yes? - You know what? - No. - My last thought will be for you. - Thank you. So, Geremia, shall we talk about money? You're obsessed, dear heart! This is a social visit. No one makes social visits any more. A decline of our times. But I'm old-fashioned. Rosalba, this is an old friend of the family. His name's Geremia. - My sincere congratulations. - Hello. She was just in the Miss Agro Pontino contest. - Dad! - Why didn't you tell me? An old friend was on the jury, I could have put in a good word. There was no need, I won. Congratulations. The competition is brutal. Have you cashed in the 500 euro prize? She's donating it to the charity Emergency. The emergency is here, my dear. Charity begins at home. - Don't you agree? - No. - So are you happy about your wedding? - Very. And how does one feel at such a special time? - I don't think about feelings very much. - That's a provocative answer. - Your daughter is very sharp. - Yes, she is! Have you considered the possibility of him jilting you? That's impossible. Never confuse the improbable with the impossible. I have to go. Goodbye, it was nice to meet you. Goodbye, Rosalba. I'll be seeing you. Seventy-six. Nine... Fifty-three. Eighty-six. Forty-nine. Twenty-two. - I've been waiting for you. - Me? My name's Tesauro. - What happened to your arm? - What do you want? - A loan. - I can't talk about this in public. - Then let's to go your house. - Here is better. - What's it about? - I'm buying a title. - Title bonds? - No, a title of nobility. A certificate that proves I have noble blood. For what? To close a deal with the Vatican. These credentials are important to them. - I'm not interested, goodbye. - Wait. - At least hear me out. - I don't trust the Vatican. - Or God. - You don't? He didn't trust me or He'd have made me a little more handsome. So you won't give me a loan? - Try the Pirate. - No. I'm afraid of him. But not of you, you're more human. You're wrong. Forty-five. Sixty-six. Twenty-nine. Thirty-one. Twenty-one. Thirty-six. Eighteen. Twenty-eight. Sixty... Lady... This isn't very nice. What? I think Geremia Heart-of-Gold is quite upset by now. Because, as a benefactor, he lent you money for your health care. Not to squander on gambling. There's a misunderstanding, it's my own money. - This is my personal life. - There's another very big misunderstanding. You no longer have any money, until you've completely settled your debt. Nor a personal life. It all belongs to Geremia. Let's go straight to the sale section. Will you stop playing with that fucking phone? - Now this is a wedding favour! - It's beautiful! - Do you like it? - Sure, it's nice. It's tacky and horrible. There's a time to be subjective and a time to be objective and the horse and carriage is objectively beautiful. It's objectively sleazy, like you. Why is this guy picking out my wedding favours? - Geremia is a friend of the family. - What the fuck does that mean? I want the silver spoon. It's elegant and practical. Sorry, it's the horse and carriage. Oh, really? It's the carriage or the wedding. You'd call off the wedding over this? No, over what's right. Your naivety is touching. But nothing is right in this life. If I may say so... Well... The silver spoon is more suitable for a young couple. Geremia, let's make her happy. We were all young once and we've all made mistakes, so let them make theirs. I think the carriage is very nice, too, but... The horse and carriage represents excellent value. Sure, if it was free! So the spoon wins? It's even 30 cents cheaper. You don't understand shit, dear hearts. That idiot with the broken arm's keeping you awake. Who is he? - A moneylender. - That's pathetic, Dad. Getting into debt over a dinner for strangers, to get me a white dress and fuel your belief that I'm a virgin child. I'm neither of those things. It's a farce. You and Mother are terrible. You think you know everything, but you don't. I know you're neither a virgin nor a child. I know the reception dinner will be overcooked pasta and frozen fried foods. I also know you don't give a crap about a fancy wedding. - To you, it's money down the drain. - Then let's drop it. You're doing all this for me, but I don't care. It's not for you, it's for me. I don't want to be humiliated any more. Have you ever been humiliated? No. Do you know why? Because I ended up taking all the humiliation meant for you. Mother, remember Amanda? Good evening. Slower. Slower. Sorry, I felt faint. Dizziness. - Want some water and sugar? - No. Alka-Seltzer. I have indigestion from eating peppers. I don't have any, the price is exorbitant. It doesn't matter. Red peppers are like depleted uranium after 30 years. The truth is I'm sick. The humidity has been ailing me for forty years. We all stink like invalids. We're all sick, but we're beautiful. At night, in bed, we think we hear the noises of the night. But they are not the noises of the night. They're the noises of our sickness. We feel dead and lost. But actually we are angels. Noisy angels. What the hell are you doing? Sorry. So the big day's here. This is for you. Why did you do this? We appreciate your dedication to us. I'm happy when I can help. But I have a big favour to ask you. And only someone as generous as you can do it. You know the rules are the same for everyone. - An extension is... - No, you don't understand. I know you're cross with my daughter because of her choice of wedding favours. But only you can help her now. I'm willing to forgive. What happened? The shoulder strap on her dress came undone and the wedding is in an hour. My husband said you're a tailor. - Needle and thread, straight away! - Thank you. See you at the church. Where is your daughter located? - I'll come with you. - Time is a hard master. Mending a wedding dress is complicated, like surgery. If you come with me, I'll be nervous, make a mistake and ruin the whole day. - Then I'll go and get ready. - A wise decision, dear heart. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - You're touching me. - No. - I'm touching heaven. - It's not heaven. - It's youth. - I've never touched heaven before. Do you know the meaning of the word "charity"? This has nothing to do with charity, it's humiliation. - And humiliation has a price. - That's true. 100% interest has a new price. Eighty. Humiliated and offended. Look hard, I am heaven. And the pleasures of heaven must be carefully calculated. - 50%. - 10. 12%, my dear. - What are you doing here? - I have to talk to you. What do you want? There's a problem with the bingo granny. She has a son, but he got rid of his bonds. - What do you want to do? - Get rid of her. - What do you mean? - What I said. Get rid of her, use the twins. - I refuse. - I'll do it. - But she's 70 years old. - Exactly. We've never gone this far before. Sooner or later it had to happen. Do it again. Hi, I'm Attanasio. - What are you eating? - A chocolate. This is a tailor's, not a candy store. Pay the girls for the hemming. This isn't about hemming. You want my chocolates? I'm the sales manager of Montanaro and Co. and I work very closely with Giulio Montanaro. Lucky you! Who's he? - The king of bidets. - He's good at using bidets? No, he's good at mass producing bathroom appliances. - He's 38, with 3 claims against him. - Concise. - What do you mean? - Be concise. Not only does he have three claims. He also has a sister in London who's married to the MD of a multinational with two hotel chains in the UK and the US. About 100 hotels. Each hotel has about 200 rooms. He wants to redo all the bathrooms. To beat the competition they need to fully equip every bathroom. - Equip with what? - A bidet. They don't use bidets in the UK and US. - I know that, Mr Trivial Pursuits. - Sorry. Anyway, that's 20,000 bathrooms to redo. So how much do you want? 20,000? 30,000? More or less around a million euros. You need a stomach pump. Too much chocolate. I'm a benefactor, I provide small loans to the needy. You've got the wrong person. A million euros? I've never seen that much. Doubled in two months. You could triple it, I don't step out of my league. I'm not unintelligent. In my accounting class report, they wrote, "We suggest you continue your studies," but then life... I never beg anyone, I do business. You have 48 hours to decide if you want to meet with Montanaro. If I don't hear from you, I'll go and see the Pirate. See you soon, I hope. I've seen you cry, Raimondo. I know because I read it in Reader's Digest. A man can't forgive someone he's seen cry. I believed in our friendship, you didn't. Friends don't hide in nightclub bathrooms. This is humiliating for me. I saw you cry and you want me to forget? Fine. But how can I forget 42,000 euros? I have to have it, you have to give it. But that's not where my advantage lies. I saw you cry. That's my advantage. A million euros? - That's insane! - That's what I say. Good thing you said no. - I haven't yet. - What are you waiting for? Mother says Father handles such deals. You've always kept it low key. Caution is your strongpoint. Only a real businessman can handle amounts like that. A brave one, too. - Why talk me out of it? - I'm your friend. I don't have friends. I know. How did you end up handling the bingo granny? That evil witch has vanished. What do you dream of doing in life? Going to live in Tennessee. Were you two alone? We were coming back from a country music festival. We'd been dancing all night. We were tired. - Dancing is nice. - Yeah. In moderation. Take these posters down, it looks like a prison cell. They keep me company. It's kind of you to let me stay here, but I'd like to go back to my life. If you leave this place, you'll have no life to go back to. I'm protecting you, got that? Why Tennessee? It's far away. What do you want? The shop's closed. I'm a pathetic, disgusting person. Don't be so soft on yourself. Why not just kill yourself? - No one would save me. - Saving you would be a crime. Suicide always has an ironic outcome and I can't afford irony. You're a rat, an arrogant rat. I killed you, I know that. But when you kill someone, you die with them. I died with you. Do you understand? We're in the same boat. - What can I get you? - Orange soda. Coffee, please. Now, usually in these cases, we do some small talk. But what's the point? That's not why we're here. We'd all be thinking, "Get to the point!" - You agree? - Yes, no small talk. You're wondering what guarantee I can offer. - My work is all about guarantees. - I have something even better. Contracts, signed and counter-signed. - Where are they? - Right there. Here you are. How much do you need? 1.2 million euros. Signatures and counter-signatures are often fake. - So is money. - Sometimes, but less often. You need scientists to counterfeit money. To counterfeit contracts, desperate fools are enough. Of course, I'm not insinuating anything. It seems otherwise. So how about this... You take the contracts, verify them and bring them back. Makes sense if you give me the originals. - Fine. - We can't give the originals. It's fine, Geremia. Then it seems we've covered everything for now. - I only have one condition. - No, no, no. - I'm the one who uses the word "condition". - I'm short of time. I've been helping others for 40 years and no one has time. Wait a second. Please follow me. This way. You've been so kind to spare us your time so I'd like to do something in return. First you pressure me, then you waste my time. My apologies. It was just a gesture to mark our deal. We have no deal yet. - He was just showing off. - Who does he think I am? If I want a woman, I hardly need a whore. I know how to get women. I'm a good talker, I'm cultured and know everything. Politics, psychoanalysis, bankruptcy auctions, art... Those two in the hot tub upset me, too. No, they didn't, you wanted to jump in. Your wallpaper reveals all. - Montanaro's a bad person. - I say forget about it. - It costs me nothing to look into those contracts. - As you wish. I can ask De Martino. Massa, the guy in Rome. The one having an affair with your cousin. He's an honest guy, depends how he reacts to private money lending. He wouldn't want you to tell his wife about your cousin. What do you want? It's 8 a. m! All I can offer you is tap water. That's fine. I'd like to take you hunting on Sunday. Sorry, but I don't how to shoot a gun. Sorry for being aggressive and rude the other day. It's okay, I like aggressive and rude people. My father was an aristocrat. He had a secret affair with the governess and I was the result. - He's always refused to see me. - Or acknowledge you. Is that your father? - Handsome. - Why have you come? Because my father's title is up for sale and I must buy it, if you'll lend me the money. You're dreaming, dear heart. Fathers never come back, whether they die or disappear. All that's left is a memory and even that doesn't last. They become our heroes and heroes have no surname, no children, no family. They're adults alone against the world and proud of it. We're their children and we'll never be heroes. All of this to say no? Yes. Look at this. Nice, isn't it? I'm a widower and I'm gay. I'm so sorry. About what? That you're a homosexual, dear heart. We need to talk about money again. - Funerals are expensive. - It's not the time. This is the time to mourn your wife's death. She was in the bedroom talking to Rosalba. I heard a noise, Rosalba screaming. A heart attack. My condolences. I'm here with you during this time of pain. You're here because you want to fuck me again. Hi. I made cutlets. Put the Alfa Romeo's brake pads on the Volvo. I love you. - So you're leaving? - I have to work. I'm sorry, especially about the omelette. The funeral was mediocre. It's a shame. I've seen more captivating funerals. - Goodbye. - You're leaving? Go on, then. Your husband seems like a decent chap. He's a moron. Marrying him was a big fuck-up. We've been together since we were 13. He holds no secrets or mystery for me. I can even guess the results of his football matches. Are you in love with me? Completely. Not me. Your mother's heart attack... Were you telling her about us? I was telling her I'm pregnant. It was supposed to be good news. You can die from happiness, too. You're pregnant? And... Who's the father? Is it mine? - Is it mine? - I don't know. I'll find out when it's born. If it's a monster, it's yours. Sixty-five. Forty-three. Six... This is Superbingo! The jackpot is 40,000 euros. Granny said to give you this: she's paying in one go. You deserve a nice chocolate, dear heart. Granny said not to take anything from you. Say you love me and the debt's settled. Even if you don't mean it, just say it. How does one get that desperate? By having a happy childhood. Why are you here? What's wrong with your office? I don't let people like you in my office. The contracts are all valid. - So you're suggesting... - That you look inside yourself. Look hard at your conscience. I've been told about you, you're a loan shark. Redeem yourself, that's my advice. Solicitor! You're all renting. You were given the world on loan. I lend the world to you when you happen to lose it. How ugly! - God, it's Tesauro. - Tell him to fuck off. I'm not wearing panties. Geremia, what did you break? - Why are you wearing that? - An awful migraine. - But now it's gone. - It suits you. Making fun of me? I raped you on your wedding day. I'm the least charming man in the world. I feel sorry for you. There... I gathered that. Falling in love with you was the last thing that could happen. An awful, disgusting thing. But it happened and I don't want to run away. I don't want to be a coward and regret it the rest of my life. I want to be brave. In the end, being brave is the last chance we have to change our lives when we stop liking ourselves. With regrets we only die sad and lonely. - What's that? - A potato, ignore it. - Am I doing it wrong? - No, your cast is poking me. Let's stop for a minute. Stop? This damn arm. I've made up my mind, Mother. It's all we have. One million and they give us two. That's not how I taught you. I always told you small loans, little by little, like ants. That's how we got rich. If you lend all that money in one go, you may never see it again. We could lose everything. I'm grown up now, I'm not a child any more. I don't need your advice. Your father could do something like that. - Not you. - I'm leaving. I have a girlfriend to move in with. You're going to a nursing home. You're my nursing home. Not any more. I don't care how much it costs, you'll get the best care. You've changed. You're a spendthrift now. That's what happens when men meet women. But women are the end of men like you. Do you know why? Because you're a good man. And as you said, goodies die children. Children are immortal. Mother! Mother! Dad? Dad? - What are you doing here? - Nothing. We killed two lions at the Coliseum and now the emperor's wife wants to screw us. Get back, Dad. - You're his kids? - Yes, but I'm the oldest. - Why are you dressed like idiots? - It's our living. For tourists. - You stole my money. - We wish! Your friend took it. He gave us 5,000 to play the part. - What friend? - That Gino who was always with you. - I'm going to shoot you, say goodbye. - Goodbye. Don't be stupid, there are witnesses. We're going for pizza, want to come? - Pizza? - It's close by. He just lost a million euros, he's not hungry. What if you have it? If we had a million euros, would we be walking around Rome at 4 a. m. dressed like morons? Let's go have a pizza, it'll take your mind off it. Look, it's over. That Gino approached us a long time ago and planned the whole thing. He asked if we were interested and we said yes. We're actors, Cinecitt? used to be our home. I was an extra for Fellini, twice. Then Italian cinema went into crisis... - Was he by himself? - No, with those thugs, the twins. And that babe? - What babe? - Miss Agro Pontino. She'll win the finals one day, take it from Augusto. My last thought will be for you. - You don't owe Geremia anything. - I'm in debt to him. And debts must be repaid. You don't know what Geremia's capable of. And you? What are you capable of? I'd rather not know. Goodbye, Dad. - I'm going to Rome. - What for? You're just like me. - How? - No ambition. I have plans and I know how to make them happen. How? What can you do? I... I can dance. You can't do anything and you're scared shitless. Leave the wreaths on the balcony. You didn't get any wreaths. Everyone knows Mother didn't like flowers. Thank you. We're on the wrong side, Dad, because there was no room anywhere else. Well, all right. We told ourselves, "Let's be baddies, because goodies die children." That's all right, too. We just forgot to tell ourselves where the limit was, because there is a limit, Dad. I don't know it.
