"Owning a freighter on the high sea" "is like having your own empire." "According to united nations convention on the law of the sea,‚Äù "all ships, regardless of their nationality, have the right to sail." "With the increase in maritime crime," "mercenary vessels have become a blooming business." "They provide weapons to protect merchant ships," "but some engage in crimes" "like human or drug trafficking." If you're listening to this, I'm probably dead already. My name is king wu. My job is to gain people's trust and then betray them. I'm a cop. An undercover cop. Let me go! Anyone out there? Hey! Anyone out there? Hey! Let me go! Hey! Anyone out there? Hey! Let me go! Hey! Scared? You should be. Remember. I don't like to play games with anyone. You're an exception. The 3 rules of undercover work: 1. Never expose your true identity. 2. Never commit real crimes. 3. Never get personal with your targets. Did I make it through without breaking them? Well... Boss. Is Bob stoned again? You know him, always testing the goods before delivery. Wu, you know what? We have a mole among us. - Sir. - Hold on! Come on. Boss. Don't call me "boss". I'm not your boss. Call me "dad". You've won my daughter's heart. Listen. Nobody is trustworthy here. You know? I've locked the cop in the car. Go grab him! Sure. Let me go! What's the matter with you? Tiger? It smells really bad. Bob, you gotta trust me. I know you're too stoned. You gotta trust me. I'm not a cop. Lucky I'm smart or we'd all be doomed. You're a cop! Could it be a mistake? You met tiger long ago when you were hiding in Taiwan. If you weren't my son-in-law, I would think you're with him. Fireboy! These photos are the proof. Photos? Proof? Wait, Bob! You're in here, too. It's some kind of costume party. Who took these photos? Who made me dress like that? Fireboy, I'll kill you! You shut up! Gosh! Look, Bob! The buyers. Eva, hold your fire. Wait until you see the cash. Hire guns, heavy gears. The buyers are here, sir. Order? Keep calm and hold on. Hey, everybody. Are you here to fight or to make money? Here's your money. I don't want it. Boss, why do you speak english? You come here to trade? Or to host a talk show? You may as well sing a song! Maybe later. Show them the merchandise. Go check it out. Music time. Okay. Great stuff. Give him the money. Wait. That's how you test the thing? What's that noise? What's going on? Don't hold back. Pump up the volume! I'd go play with them. Cover me. Roger that. What should we do, sir? Sir? Mission accomplished. Contact! Front! I've got some good stuff. Fireboy, car doors won't stop bullets. It works in the movies. Go. Get my money back! Fall back! Fall back! Fall back! Look! That's how I roll! You suckers! I'm gonna show you some real stuff. Bob! Let's go, Bob! What are you doing? Bo... boom! Come on! It seems the fight's over. Still need to wait? Hold on and wait. Bob. It's your lucky day, wu! You are to take my place. I'm not ready, Bob. Thing happens, and someone's gotta take care of it. Remember... Take good care of my daughter... And my organization. Give me the phone, you idiot! Hello. Hello... my darling. Here's a good news for you. The goods you gave me, all gone. Wu will take care of the business from now on. Please look after him. Before I go, I'd love to hear you say... "Bobby." If I could get high for one last time, that'd be perfect. Hey! Wu! Where's everybody? You've saved me again? You okay? You've saved me again, wu? - Go away! - Okay. See you. See you later, wu. Bob! Hello? You're wu who worked for Bob? Yes, I'm wu. Hey! Where are you taking me? Madame tung wants to see you guys. Guys? Who else? Why did you bring us here? Use your brains. Fugu sashimi, dare to eat? You could call me madame tung. Did you kill Bob? I'm not responsible for Bob's death. Tiger could prove that. Who calls for me? Wu, my bro! You are the only two persons who survived. How would I know who the mole is? Bob said he wanted you to take over the business. That's forcing me to trust you. Now, you kill him for me! Wu, my bro! You wouldn't mind, would you? Careful! Such videos often leak to the web. Sorry, madame tung. I couldn't do it. Then how could I trust you? You kill him and I'll make you Bob's successor. Why are you on his side? He saved me, twice. Could you pretend we're never here, madame tung? You wasted me so much time! You kidding? I'll be in debt to you. You? How about him? He'll be my responsibility. You sure? I think you should be my responsibiliy? Be grateful I didn't pull the trigger on you. You'll take Bob's place, wu. You know pretty well what clients he had. Call me when there's a problem. Got it. You want a tattoo? I'm here to see my girl. Bob's daughter? To tell her that her dad died? Stay calm, my bro. I'll stand by you. You've got a point. I should think it through first. Wu. Dawnie, wu's here. You're in trouble. You didn't answer her calls. - Wu. - Yes. We'll talk after I finish with this client. Sure. What happened? - Bob's dead. - What? Bob's dead. Who's that? Tiger. Madam, I'm tiger. Bob couldn't make it. What happened? What happened? He was shot to dead. I've told him to quit. Sorry. I couldn't save him. Let's do this some other time. Don't move! You dad died. Don't take it out on me. Shut up! You wait outside. Tiger. What are you doing? I wanna honour Bob. How? My previous gang leader. Where's he now? Dead. Save a spot for me. Courier delivery, sir. Please sign here, sir. It's done. Where is this place? Somewhere in the pacific. Why am I here? I apologise for bringing you here like this. My employer doesn't like people refusing his invitation. Would you like a drink Hi I'm ha, specialized in logistics. You mean smuggling. It's logistics business... But with higher risk and return. Why did you bring me here? What? Why did you bring me here? Well, here's the deal. Bob, your late leader, owed me something. Could you help him... Settle it? I bet you know that... Our goods were burnt, money robbed. Listen, I'm just asking you to find someone for me. The drug cook of your gang. There's a drug cook? You know, recently Bob had abundant supply of drug... In high quality. He must have his own production plant. Or it'd be impossible. So, your gang must have a drug cook, right? I really have no idea. I see your concern. You'll get a share of the profits from Hong Kong. Don't say no to me! Boss he's the official who doesn't want to work with us. You put our goods on hold? I don't mean to. But you're not paying enough. All the custom officers need a cut. Sorry it doesn't work out. You must be hungry, though? Hungry, right? Go get some food. Help yourself. Go ahead. Relax. Welcome to the high sea! Cut out all the organs. Sell them. Find me a replacement. I'll take you home. Don't worry. I won't put you in a carton box this time. Anybody? Yeah, looking good. Keep it up. What? Mr ha. You know about the Dutch holding our merchandise? Y eh. Some of us think you didn't make the right call. Think? I don't pay you guys to think. Yes, we all get paid. That's why we want to get the job done and get our cuts. We don't trust that prick. We signed up with you to get money, we didn't sign up to go on a murder spree. Forget it. If anyone can defeat me, he can take the boat. We're all on the same boat. Is this really necessary? You stay out of it. I like democracy. Just sign it. What's this? I've got the authorization. Your undercover mission is over. Sign it and you'll get back your true identity. The case is not over yet. Just let it go. I don't wanna watch our guy get killed. I've just taken Bob's place. I've found out who is backing him. Hold on. Just listen to me. A guy named ha has taken me to the high seas. He knows how I look. I'm the only one who could carry on this investigation. This is a sound Cannon for attacking pirates on the high seas. I think that mysterious biker had something to do with ha. This has nothing to do with you. Would you please let it go? If you had seen what happened in that boat, you wouldn't let it go, either. Hold on a second. Come on, my bro. You've been undercover. You should know what I mean. Remember when I was a "gangster"... And you were a beat cop questioning me? What did you say to me? You played your role so well. How would I know you were undercover? I just remember asking you... "Why can't you be a good guy?" Exactly. I'm offering you a chance to be a good guy. Thing happens and someone's gotta take care of it. I wish I could be the one to complete the investigation. We'll hold a roadside vigil for Bob tomorrow. Leaders of various factions of the gang will be there. In order to take over Bob's business, I need to get their approval. Who would be scared of him? He'll get threatened. Mr. wu. We are all counting on you! Especially my wife and I, you see? Sure, monkey. My condolences, wu. Last time I met Bob, I had a bad hunch. I just never thought... Wait! You don't look very well either. Mr. wu. Just listen. Count me in for any project. Call me for any issue you have, my bro. Except money problems. You ran off again? The guys say they will avenge my father. Please count me in. Avenge? You don't even know who your enemy is, do you? You don't have the slightest clue... And yet you talk about avenging. What a joke! Who are you? Magnum, his pal. I don't know who you are. We've met before. Sorry about what happened to Bob. It's you! How could we be pals? For we have a common enemy. I believe you know ha. Let's have a chat. Who are they? He's the biker who burnt our goods and robbed our money. So, they're responsible for Bob's death? You're drug dealers. This is Karma. How dare you! You should have your hair cut. Ever since Bob's last deal, we've been watching you. What do you know? Everything. All your little secrets. So, you've got secrets? I don't have any secrets. What about secret lovers? Ha let you leave his boat alive. You must have promised him something? What's your deal with ha? Why are you after him? He and ha were both members of the "trident". A special force for fighting organized armed crime on the high seas. We were ordered to take out a smuggling ring two years ago. Ha was sent to infiltrate a freighter, but he blew his cover and got caught. We raided the ship to save him. To our surprise, he turned on us... And killed every teammate who refused to submit to him. Including my fianc√©. He took over the freighter... And became a very powerful smuggler. Since then, Eva and I have been trying to stop ha's crimes. Now, can you be honest? What did you promise him? He wants a drug cook, to cook drug on the high seas. We must stop him before he gets even more powerful. Give it to me, tiger. Actually, I got two. We've finally met our match. The ultimate villain! Another custom officer died. I've seen him in the freighter. Ha's always like that. If he can't bribe you, he'll kill you. He'll keep on killing until someone takes his bribes. If we could find the drug cook, we could trade with ha and get a chance to take him down. You know the location of madame tung's factory? I don't. I bet even Bob didn't know. Let's set up a sting drug deal. Get the drug cook and bait ha. Come. You really wanna work with them? I don't have a choice, but you do. You don't need to risk your life. I've realized that luck is on my side. I'll live longer than you. When did you get it? I thought you were dead. Don't get upset. We'll all die eventually. You're still here? Don't touch me. I'm not your girl anymore. Oh, you still remember that. Get the boat ready. I want to get ashore. You want to get ashore? You don't have to go. I need to stand in the frontline. You know, you taught me this. Don't you agree with me? You don't need anyone's approval, do you? I do need yours. Drive. Drive! Go! You need a hand? I'm fine. No need to get you dirty. Your coffee, mama. Good boy. The flame is too strong. Turn it off. Sure. Tung's drug factory is inside that compound. Shouldn't I go with you? You'd better stay here and cover for us. They're going in. I'm in position. We've got intruders, mama! Keep calm. I'll get help. Don't panic. Keep calm. Trust your godmother. Calm your breathing. The key to sniping is accuracy in sensing the distance. You don't measure it by eye. You gotta feel it. Sometimes you need to close your eyes... To feel the real distance. Hi, pretty girl! Where is your drug cook? Handsome boy. You're too direct. It's not a joke. The chief chemist is here. He's dead. Magnum, we've got company. Madame tung's men are here. Warn them now. We're from galactic bank. We're offering low-interest loans... The number you dialed is not available right now. The secret recipe of cooking drug? How did the chief chemist die? Afraid of getting arrested? So he committed suicide? Do we look like cops? You're not? The chief really died in vain then. So, this is how drug is made? It doesn't look that difficult. Let me try. Don't touch! Pouring sulphuric acid into the main ingredient... Would release poisonous gas. The main ingredient? Ephedrine. You don't know that and you wanna cook drug? Pretty girl. You looks like an expert. You're flattering me. Oh, no! I'm just saying. I don't know much. Freeze! You really think you're handsome? Finish them! I'm not handsome? Old lady, running slowly. It shouldn't be wasted. Get the drug cook, tiger! You hang in there! Don't think of me as a drug cook only. When I was a furious street racer, your dads were still babies. Someone else shows up. It's ha. Why is he here? Stay calm. Our goal is to take down his smuggling ring and bring him to justice. Where's the drug cook? Don't worry. My guy will catch her. How do you find me? I'm a logistics guy. How do I track my packages? Your game is over! Your game is over! Wu, my bro! Have you caught the drug cook? Yes, but there's a problem. Where are you? I'll be there soon. Eva? Hal You've done all these things... For a woman? I met Eva... Long after Jack had died. Remember, you're the one who shot Jack. We could have had it all, but your stubbornness ruined it. If not for your betrayal, Jack would still be alive. Everything I did was for the best interest of our team. What had you done for the team? Magnum. Hang in there. You gotta hang in there. Don't you think it's a waste of your life? Targeting me for years. He's the one who killed Jack. I'll let you take the shot. You wanna kill and die for other people? I don't. Let's create our own empire. Jack! Change course. Lower your weapon! Don't you think about Eva? He's not one of us. Kill him. Magnum, sorry! Jack! No... You're lying. I owe Jack my life. You could take it if you want. But if Magnum survives, how could I face Jack when I join him? Jack... I killed Jack. It's me, ha. Where is the drug cook? Could we wait...? No way! Now! Hello? Bad reception. Hello? Bad reception here. The number you have dialed is not in service. - Clear. - Clear. Clear. What do you want? What's going on? I'll call the cops! Susane! Name of the kidnapped girl? Dawnie fok. I've invited your girlfriend to my boat, wu. Please bring along the drug cook. Where is the drug cook? Give her to me. I need a way to get to ha. Sorry, we've lost the drug cook. How could you lose the drug cook? Ha killed Magnum. Ha also kidnapped wu's girlfriend. He asked us to trade her back on the high seas. Now what? Didn't you say luck's on your side? What are you scared of? Wu's your pal. You'll help him, won't you? And you won't give up on your girl, right? You guys just want to do it without me? Right? Risking one life is better than two. Risking two is better than three. Count me in. We'll go together. You won't make it without me. Magnum's dead. No one knows the structure of the boat like I do. Okay. Without the drug cook, now what? I'm not the kind of girl who relies on others. I can take care of myself. If we won't have a happily ever after, I wish you would take good care of yourself. I don't want you to end up like my dad. Thanks for being by my side all these years. Once on board, tiger will stall them by pretending to be the drug cook. Eva will rescue the kidnapped girls, then find a way out. In case it doesn't work out, I've made a remote control bomb. The bomb... will it actually explode?? It'd be better for you not to know. Don't touch my ingredients! I want to leave. This is your home. If you leave this boat, where else could you go? I'll go back to my hometown. Nobody there could fulfil your needs, and none of them needs you. For many years, only wars and corruption stated there. I don't see the difference. What you need is a sniper rifle, not me. The drug cook will be here soon. I'll give you half of my profits. Okay? He's the drug cook. And we've brought you a batch of ingredients. This should cover your previous losses. Wu! What do you want? Mr. ha wants you to work for him. Just do what you're doing and no one's gonna get hurt. You could threaten him, but I won't be threatened into working for you. Big boss Do you know his true identity? An undercover cop. We have our sources. And Mr. ha knows who you are. Big sister! Are you okay? Show time! Well. Okay. Are you ready? Now I'm gonna teach you how to make drug. First, let's take a look at the ingredients: Activated carbon, ephedrine. Red lotus, essential oil, sulphuric acid, last but not the least, I heard it's explosive... Ether okay. We need to put the activated carbon... Into the essential oil, and soak it for 12 hours, but we don't have 12 hours. "Dangerous goods warehouse" fine. I'll do it. I'll do it. But I need music. Without music, I couldn't do it. Butter, pancake and milk tea milk tea, milk tea, milk tea butter, pancake and milk tea my fair lady. I need real music. Come. Follow me. Come on. Hurry up! There's an explosion in the lab. Sound the alarm. Get to your posts. Get to your posts. - Big sister! - No! Big sister! Big sister! Come here, girl! Come! No. Wait! Just the four of you? You liar! And I've followed you on wechat! Just unfriended. And your look, it's unbearable! I'm not scared of you, big boss! Still not scared. He's interesing. Jack's gone for just two years, and you're now willing to die for another guy. I do this for Jack. I'm here to complete his unfinished mission. Oh, you've joined trident. That's good. I think they are hungry. We'll feed them some food. Hal what? Just blow it up! If you blow this ship, I would simply find another one. Do you have the slightest idea what I am capable? Hey. Do you want me to give you some tnt? Are you okay? Wu! Focus! Come on! Thank you. You don't measure it by eye. You gotta feel it. Sometimes you need to close your eyes... To feel the real distance. I've offered you a chance to live well, but you chose to die. I'll take you down with me. What's to be afraid of? I really can't get it. You risk your life for something so meaningless. Why? Thing happens and someone's gotta take care of it. People like you will die not knowing what that means. Prove it to me. Prove it to me. I'm just a lousy undercover cop, today when I ventured out into the high sea, I did not expect to come back alive. I've failed so many people, but right now, all I can do is... Keep on going. He's a mole. Why you come back? I'm undercover, too. I've been there, too. Hey. Are you okay? No need to say a word, then. You life is giving to him. Now you are going to die, no one will be appreciated. Thank you. My bro. Luck will get you nowhere. I don't count on luck. I count on my bro. Your bro? Wu! Ha is finished. Do you really want to fight till everyone is dead? Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Go! Are you okay? Wu. Why so late? Are you really an undercover cop? Shall we keep waiting, sir? Yes. Sir. It's over. We're on the high seas waiting for your rescue. This is too serious. Please hold on! The ship is sinking! Hold on to what? Trust me. Everything's under control. Under control? Awesome! Then I shouldn't hold you up. Welcome back.
