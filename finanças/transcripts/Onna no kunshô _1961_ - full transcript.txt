Machiko Kyô Ayako Wakao Junko Kano, Tamao Nakamura, Jirô Tamiya Eiji Funagoshi, Ken Mizuta, Taketoshi Naito, Masayuki Mori Kazuko Miyagawa, Chikako Hosokawa, Hisako Takihana, Sumiko Hidaka, Chieko Murata Directed by Kozaburo Yoshimura (Kôzô Kannô, Michihiko Obimori ) Hey! You're here again? It's pretty much finished. And... - Well then? - I can't help but think of some religious cult! A flaming sun, it's my family-crest. It's yours so you can do what you like! The bank finally agreed on the architect's fees. Thanks to your skilled negotiating. All those licensing requirements and regulations. I can handle the banks but the construction companies are much tougher. Rinko says the same thing. Yesterday I counted the number of bathroom tiles in each row. They used 2,000 tiles less than they said in the estimate! 20 yen per tile, 40,000. 50 per row in the quote. However they use just 40. Each of those 10s we save 2,400. - 2,4000! - You even count the toilet tiles? We're borrowing heavily from the bank. We can't waste a single yen. - I suppose not. - Can you take a look at this? Ah, yesterday I saw Mrs. Kaneko Yasua of Futaba Dressmaking School. - Did you talk with her? - She's still not said yes. Please sign this. As a suburban dressmaking school, it's better having 2 or even 3 branches. In fact the more the better! Unless they start to impinge on each other! How about your school? It's not a western dressmaking school. She has 25 years experience. Compared to them we are such a humble little place. Here you are. Thanks. I find it unpleasant you need permission from neighboring schools. They form an alliance. Soon they'll show up, big bosses, small bosses... - So the certificate... - Will be ready by the opening ceremony. In return I'll have to send them a little something. Oh yes... I need to go to the construction site and discuss the final pricing. Please excuse me. I'm going into Osaka. I'll treat you to dinner. - Great. - 6 o'clock in Shinsaibashi. See you then. It's almost done! Our efforts have finally come together. It's time to say goodbye to those cramped old classrooms. Your stained glass is fitted! How does it look? - Oh, it's beautiful, isn't it? - It's very imposing. Let's have a celebratory drink, or have dinner in Osaka. I'd be delighted! Do you mind Mr Yashiro coming as well? Let's get going then. With Ginshiro, eh! The legal recognition of the school caused tax issues. It's been a little difficult. It took 4 or 5 days to resolve. I can deal with technical matters about the school myself, but I know so little about tax and city hall. Don't worry, I'll do all the complicated stuff. The equipment is fine but what about the recruitment? Thanks to the adverts we've had a lot of applications. After the shabby old place a new, modern, well-equipped one. All those fed up with the old place will love to come to the new! As if a dressmaking school just needs premises and adverts to succeed. I know I mustn't ignore the designers' talent. That's the most important thing. But saying that, it still won't be enough. Nowadays, prospective students choose reputation and equipment. They choose the prestigious. That's a naive male view. Those who want to learn will decide on practical grounds, like how they teach. In the old days when you taught at home in a converted room that was the case. This time, we have an 80 tsubo site. (265 square metres) So, we'll be a company. I have the idea of a new dressmaking enterprise. This may be rude to say to you but... A blunt view from a man's perspective is what's needed for our development. You're embarrassing me! For 4 years it's just been we 4 women... And we may be stuck in our ideas. I want your constant, frank advice. I value it. I was brought up in a good family so I'm not street-savvy. Well, I have something I must do. Please excuse me. Huh, what affectation! Well I suppose so. It's awful! He's been here less than a year. What's with his pushy attitude? I agree. He graduated from a decent university, he has his own business yet... Now he struts in and out of the place like he owns it. He was telling us to teach French to our students. And before we knew it, he wormed his way into school management. Sensei, I'm getting worried. Is everything OK? Everything's fine. Do you think he's any good? Rather than a man keeping silent... It's better when they say what they think. It's authoritative. Huh? A man's hands are sometimes useful! But don't worry. A dress-making school is of course a women's school! 4 years ago I opened the school here in spite of my uncle's opposition. At first, it was only one room near the entrance. And we sold off that old bomb-site in Semba (high-class merchant quarter). When I decided to buy this house, you burst into tears! I was worried about what would happen. We opened our doors in the evening too. Even with morning and afternoon classes we had too many students. Now, two years on the new school is finally a reality. If only your husband had lived to see it. Yes, I wish he could have seen today's opening ceremony. Oh, who is it? - Come in! - Good morning! I'm here to collect her. - Thanks. Just a moment! Please come in. - Thanks but I'll wait outside. - Very well. Oh? Congratulations! Thanks for your hard work everybody. Welcome. - Oh, Ginshiro is with you? - He came to pick me up. Rinko or I could have come by yours! Good morning. Congratulations! Good work, everyone! We dressed up especially! What do you think? - Nice! It suits you. - Not bad I suppose. Excuse me but the Congressman is here. I'll go! By the way, I planned today's opening ceremony. I trust that's OK. - You did it? - You've all been so busy. Let me deal with the guests. Thank you for coming! Sensei... Is he going to be master of ceremonies too? Nothing's been decided. I think it would be fine if he did it. I don't think any of us want to! Mr. Ohara, the President of the Federation of School Administrators, is here. Thank you. This is our director. My name is Ohba, Shikiko Ohba. Thank you so much for coming. My wife sends apologies, she's busy with the fashion show. Yasuda-sensei from Futaba Academy. Welcome! Thank you so much for coming. Oh, Mr. Chairman! Long time no see! Is your wife doing well? That show was huge! Everybody is talking very positively about it. A dressmaking school is not just a bridal school. But nor is it a school that provides some kind of vocational education. I believe it is a place for young women to receive their cultural formation. When I think of the word 'design' it's not just about designing fabrics. But design in everyday life. In other words by the individuality and sensitivity of each person, our lifestyle and living environment are beautifully designed. It shapes, beautifully, the very form of our daily lives. And this sun shaped stained glass is the crest and emblem of our academy. Gorgeous as the sun, pure of heart, and with gentle grace... That's what I sincerely wish for. Yes, thank you. - I'm going home! - See you later! You can go home now too. I'm exhausted. Tomie... you're very quick at sewing by hand ... But you don't like the pattern to prototype stage, do you? Rather than designs on paper ... I'm looking forward to working with well-structured pieces. It's all that heavy fabric we use! You like fine stitching on thin fabric, don't you? What about Shikiko? I don't know what she's been doing recently. Working so late in her office. Going to meeting after meeting! Today it's the Kansai Association meeting. All those bosses together mouthing off, so boring. I wonder if she's there with Ginshiro. With Ginshiro? He's running around trying to raise money. The time when fashion shows were just about fashion is over. And so we, The Association of Dressmaking Schools, using the first class designers we have here in Kansai, want to create an epoch-making event. A fashion show for daily life. On the street, in the office, in the home... Our objective is fashion linked to family-life. So, I want us to select the event management team. The steering committee will negotiate with the manufacturers, decide the sequence of presenting the pieces. The allocation of models, fabrics, everything that needs to be done. So with regard to the vote... We need two in alliance. From the top scoring names, we will select four committee members. As I said, I'm not standing personally. votes for each candidate I humbly accept the role of chairwoman of the steering committee. First of all, the designers and their partner manufacturers need to be settled. If you have no connections to a manufacturer raise your hand. The group can arrange something for you. Eh? Just Ohba-san. Allow me to introduce the lady there who was the only one to raise her hand. Shikiko Ohba, my neighbouring school director. She had that family crest on the certificate. Ah, it was you who had the family crest. When my husband came back he was somewhat impressed with the wonderful stained glass. Ms Ohba... Unlike us, she's from Senba (traditional Osaka merchant quarter) She's somewhat obsessed with her family crest. Anyway, Ohba-san, don't you have a spinning company to partner with? For such a big fashion show, the factory connected to the designer, the manufacturer must provide sponsorship funding as well as material. I... I didn't know that before. Can anyone offer her a recommendation? Don't be so bitchy about it. In short, she... It doesn't matter who she gets, does it? I wonder who would offer such comments. Will you give her one of your manufacturers then? I'm just telling you to stop bullying new recruits. So shamelessly. My, how rude! When did I bully her? I'll thank you to keep your comments to yourself. - Welcome back! - Sorry I'm late. - Were you waiting? - Just over an hour. There's a sandwich! Thanks. It's hot so I'll make tea. I must plan classes but I've been so busy because of the opening ceremony. It's good that you're so busy so soon after opening. That's true, but somehow it's unpleasant with Ginshiro becoming a manager. He graduated from a first-class university, and he's our manager. What's going on? Oh, yeah, actually... Our company will start mass-producing and selling a MItsuwa fabric. Can you use it at your school to help with our publicity? For a student show or something. It gives a nice fresh impression but the colours aren't deep enough. But I wonder if I can manage somehow. It looks delicious. Oh yes... What? I smell of smoke. Good morning. The train broke down. I come on the Hanshin line too, and I didn't hear anything. Rinko! Can I have a word. - My train was late and... - Never mind that. Actually... At today's fashion show meeting we had to decide on a sponsor for each member. Do you know anyone familiar with the Mitsuwa weaving company? Huh? Not really. What about that guy Nomoto. Chubby one, he came here once, didn't he? Well, we're not very close. Although I just ordered some material from him for our student show. Good morning. You could ask Ginshiro. No, he's no good at that kind of thing. I'd like to order from Mitsuwa. I need 10,000 yen sponsorship and 3 different fabrics. I'm sorry, but can you go and try? Well, because it's for you I don't mind going to see them. I'll go and haggle fiercely! If you would. Can you cover for me please. - OK - Heading out? Just for a bit. Thanks. That's a good thing for us. I'm in the middle of an aggressive publicity plan to start selling particular prints this year. Of course we can offer you 3 fabrics and 10,000 yen. You'd better tell her immediately. No, you mustn't agree too readily. This is a chance to make her owe me one. If it weren't for our relationship, this wouldn't happen. - That's nothing to do with it. - I want to embarrass Ginshiro! Okay? I finally put together a very difficult story. What a depressing thing. Tomorrow, I'll go with her to choose the fabric. Let's act it up! - I'm back. - Welcome back. I'm sorry. You must be worried about my being late. - Well? What happened? - OK let me tell you... Well? It was hard to get an agreement... So they said no? Well it was the first time we'd mentioned it to them, so they were hesitating. Thanks to Mr. Neooto in the sales and publicity department. It's fine. I was delighted. Thanks, Rinko. Let's go and see them tomorrow morning. And you'll come with me! And I'll go with you too! Why? You can't help chose cloth. The two of us will be enough. I'm worried. It sounds far too good to be true. Sorry if I offended you. What's going on? We've been here an hour. That's really rude. Thank you. What's the matter? You've kept us waiting. We agreed it all yesterday. Why make us wait? No problem. Please excuse us coming unannounced. Actually... I'm very sorry. Yesterday, I promised Rinko that I would be happy to collaborate but... this morning I found out that we'd already a commitment with another school, and there was a big fuss. Of course, this is our fault for poor communication between the sales and publicity departments. It's my fault. What can I say to apologise? What are you saying? It's not enough to apologize. Well, please don't be so angry. This is the first time anything like this has happened. - Don't underestimate me! - Look you... It's just play-acting. Yes. No, just kidding. We'll come back another time. No point talking further today. Sorry. Sorry we caused you trouble. Come on, let's go. Excuse us. Rinko, you must be tired, go home and rest. I want to discuss this with Shikiko. Let's go. Yeah. Come on... Please, don't tell me. Please don't say that. I'm counting on you. We'll have two Takenoko set meals. What happened? A friend who works for a newspaper. He's running away? - What are you going to do? - Just leave it up to me. Oh, just a little. It's been a hard day, hasn't it. If you leave important stuff up to them you'll end up embarrassed. I may have offended Rinko. Rinko and Nomoto clearly have a relationship. So it's complicated! Rinko was being very cunning with you yesterday. There's not just a pupil-teacher relationship but also a loss and gain one. Loss and gain? Yes. And it's not just Rinko. Katsumi and Tomie... You never know what everybody is thinking! The three of them lived in my house after work. - They're mine, my disciples. - Disciples are also would-be designers. They'll hatch into chicks and fledge to become chickens. This way please. Hi! Thank you for coming. So please come in. This is Hideo Sone, from the Osaka Mainichi Newspaper. This is Shikiko Ohba of Seiwa-gakuen. Principal of the school I work for. Yes, my name is Ohba. Very nice to meet you. - Make yourself comfortable. - Thank you. - Have you eaten? - Yes. That was early! Hurry up! OK. Thanks. - So you've moved to the Culture section? - No vacancies in the Society department. In order to get top stories I lurk around the public prosecutor like a cat. For a story on professional baseball transfers, I had to use a 7-year-old child. Poor you! So what do you want? Actually, it's about the fashion show we talked about the other day. Oh! The Kansai Design Association? - With the 'lifestyle' theme. - Yes. That's it. And there's something I'd like to discuss with you. To be honest, I'm not really interested in fashion shows. Even so I want you to help me out with this. - Are these your aggressive tactics again? - Well, actually it's not the show. It's about people, living people! The Kansai Design Association is dominated by Kyoko Ohara and Ohba in charge. The fashion world is a harsh place. As a newcomer they all give her a hard time. Because she's raised in a classy Senba family. Probably you won't agree but... Senba families have reputation and wealth. Of course it was all burned in the war. But it still exists in people's minds. You must be qualified to take part in the show. So you can argue with manufacturers and get the material and sponsorship. She doesn't have the connections. Knowing that, those women embarrassed her in public. - I want your help. - What do you want me to do? I want you to speak with Mitsuwa weaving. Mitsuwa? I've never heard of them. That doesn't matter. Just make sure they realise how talented a designer she is. And she'll be a valuable advert! Just tell them that! But... But, as a newspaper reporter, I can hardly... Look Sone, we are taking on those evil bosses! Being our ally for that, would bring no shame on a newspaper reporter. Maybe... So, what do you think? Hi. I brought some cake! That's shameless. What for! I understand you were in a difficult position yesterday. What happened today was a complete surprise. It was horrendous that they believed we were faking it! Why didn't you call beforehand? I only found out this morning. I called the school but you'd already left. Everything is ruined. They know about our relationship. It's fine. We're going to get married anyway. Married? No way. This is no time for that! - Today's problem isn't connected to our marriage. - It is. For women with careers, marriage is a development. It needs careful thought. - That's very calculating! - Anyone who isn't calculating is a fool. People always use others to some extent. Consciously or not. Marriage should make all our minuses into a plus! So you don't mind minuses? Imagine if this was a business! Would you throw yourself into something you knew to be a minus? Marriage is just like big business. I failed. Ginshiro beat me! His type is hard to beat. Once the senior manager has decided, nobody can go against that. Oh how annoying! That's right. There's nothing we can do. Rinko... No! Stop that! Yes? Sorry for the late reply. Is the Association in such a hurry? It has been decided. My collaborator will be Mitsuwa Weaving. Is it ten o'clock? Don't listen to other people's phone calls. OK. - How did it go? - You didn't come back so... - Hey, Satoh! - Yes? Can you go to the bank for me. Pay this in. So, how did it go? It's all settled. Mitsuwa! - It's agreed? -Satoh worked really hard. Negotiated directly and got them to break their contract and come to us! Oh, I see. That's great. OK then. Last but not least, what are your design trends? This is the moment! Using Osaka's unique Senba traditions we'll design modern Osaka fashions. Thank you. You've saved me. From now on, don't make decisions when it's just you women. A Spencer jacket with stars. An accent in the hat and a modern youthfulness in the classic. The design was by Imami Tamiko Number 69, 69 please hurry up. Number 70, number 70, what are you doing? Quickly! Hurry up! Don't shout their numbers like a prison guard! I am Hayame Yoshiko from Nichifutsu School. I'm too busy to add 'san' to people's names! If I do we can't get them through seamlessly. The one ahead of me was delayed, what can I do. It's not my fault either! 71! Number 71! I'm sorry. This one yes, is this all right? Yes, I'm coming. - 71? - I'm coming! Sorry! Oh no! Quick. Number 72, let's go. Walk as if you are in high heels, striding ahead of everyone. Just relax. Using the beauty of traditional Japanese clothing, a plain dress with a straight drop-coat. This piece is by Shikiko Ohba. As I expected, it's superb. Number 75! Hi! I was just taking a look. Thank you. It's a nice new design. Not just of the show itself... I would like to take a photo of your design. A picture of my work! Oh, please stand together there. 76! Model 76! Out of the way, please. Next, a couple of shots of the models. With the traditional beauty of Osaka you are doing. The colour-choice is very modern. You have fresh talent. I'm so glad I could be of help. Come on in, guys! The photo needs taking from about here. It's quirky! Tell me about it. Number 80? Number 80. Hello. Good morning. Have you heard? The newspapers are taking photos! The press is good advertising. You need to ride the advert balloon and move to the next step. - The next step? - Yes. We expand the school! It's been a while since we had dinner together. Is everyone OK? They're all groaning about the heat and because of it Kazumi is absent a lot. Because I've done so well. She must be jealous. Well... The summer course teacher will be coming twice a week. I'm sorry, I stayed on alone up at Rokko. You relax and enjoy it. You look well. You seem well rested. Oh, do I? Morning! Good evening. Are you okay? Here you go. 38 degrees today. No wonder we're all struggling. - It was so hot I went for a drive to cool down. - Are you staying over? Would that be a problem? Wow, what a view. This is... - Rinko's house is over that way. - It's in Himeji. You can't see it from here. Oh, of course. - Shall we go for a stroll? - Good idea. - Among those rocks? - It's got foggy. It's dangerous! It'll be fine. Come on! Hey! OK! - Oh, sorry! - No problem. Hey! What? Where's Rinko? Oh! I don't know! Ohba-Sensei? Rinko? Shikiko-sensei? Rinko? I think it's that way. What are you doing? Stop it! Ginshiro, you shouldn't! Rinko? What do you want? What are you doing here? Isn't it slightly romantic? - I'm going to bed. - I know, that's why I'm here. - Please go now. - Let's get a bit more friendly. I can't. Rinko is in the next room! She's already long asleep. No, no. Oh no... Ginshiro - I'm scared! - At your age? Don't be ridiculous! - Good morning. There's a free table over there. - No, thanks. Good morning! Good morning. Did you sleep well last night? Like a log! It's wonderful here in the morning, isn't it? It's going to be hot again. - Can we stay here until evening? - Go ahead. Hey, let's drive down to Arima. Sounds a good idea. This looks a good route. It'll feel great to zoom along the road. How about you? Well, yes. Where's your house, Rinko? It's just up towards the Hanshin station. I'll take you home. It's an untidy apartment. I need to know where you live, in case something urgent comes up. - OK, if you insist. - It's no trouble. Thank you very much. It would be nice to be invited in for a cup of tea. A woman who lives alone shouldn't let a man into her apartment. Don't say that. Very well, come in then. Be careful because it's dark. It's very humid! Go ahead. It's very cosy and pleasant. It's hellish after the mountains though! But this is reality. Do you have any cigarettes? Cigarettes? No. I'll go buy some, the shop's very close. - Sorry to put you to the trouble. - No problem. Thank you! What's going on? Is it a power-cut? No. No, you mustn't. Don't! What if Shikiko finds out? She doesn't really know about men so it's OK. But we do need to be careful around Nomoto. It'll be bad if he finds out. Sorry to just turn up and make extra work. No. As it's for my mistress. "Young mistress"? Of course, for you she's the eldest daughter. So? What is it that you want? At today's federation meeting, we decided on the collective purchase of resources. I mean, colleges, high schools, middle schools. Educational equipment such as cameras and pianos are exempt from tax. But sewing machines, mannequins and everything else is fully taxed. We will buy in these materials collaboratively, tax-free. Then sell them through our own shop on campus. The material we buy in cheap. It'll be very profitable. I always hated buying and selling, whether it was sweets, buns or clothing. School should be a school. I don't want to see anything except tuition fees. You're not still some great Senba trading-house. The school will be like a one-legged scarecrow, it just won't grow! We have to keep pushing. I don't want us to get too large and have complicated financial problems. Leave that to me. I agreed to take on the business part. Even if you don't do that, you have more than enough work. I have a perfectly good life just with Kiyo. If I spend any more... I fear some unexpected misfortune will befall me. Look, I've explained it all. You can't act like 'the young mistress' forever. - I'm quite happy as just the mistress here. - Really? About the shop we'll set up on campus... However, I want you to choose when you buy all the teaching materials in bulk. I will do the the rest of the purchasing of course. I have no idea at all about compasses and design paper, etc. The director should do that. She understands people's feelings but she doesn't understand money. That's why I want you to do it properly. That why you hit on me, wasn't it? You carefully weighed me up against Nomoto, didn't you. Thank you! I think I'll pop to the toilet. Next time, let's go to Osaka and eat well. If you do, one day Koshien will be yours. Don't you know how hard these new compasses are for students to use? Have you noticed too? The equipment is hard to use and we're not happy. Rinko is one of the school's sources of income! Saying 'one can't always have clean hands in business'. That sounds like Ginshiro talking. Why didn't you tell me that sooner? These days you're busy doing designs for women's magazines. You hardly come in to school any more. - Rinko! - Yes? Those articles you chose and we purchased... You must take greater responsibility. They seem hard to use and I asked the students. They say the adjustment screws on the compasses are no good at all. Oh, have any students said that? I sense personal gain lies behind some of our purchasing choices. I just did what Ginshiro told me. Ginshiro? Where is Ginshiro? He's busy seeking finance for the new school. What new school? So you... How come you know all about this? I overheard it when he was passing. Come with me, all three of you. What's all this furtive going on? - There's something I want to ask you too. - What is it? - Close the door. - OK. I hear you plan to build a new school. Is this true? It is. Where is the money coming from? It's my job to find it, isn't it? Something so important... and you didn't consult me? I did! - I didn't know about this. - Oh come off it! I said you have to ride the advertising bubble after the successful show. Next time we go bigger! - Right in Shinsaibashi (central Osaka). - Is a site already fixed? In Nakatsu! The best part of Osaka. A 200 tsubo (660 m2) site. The regulations require more than 100 tsubo so we utterly have that! The deposit's paid so just pay the rest by the deadline and complete the building by the start of the next academic year. Seiwa will be right in the heart of Osaka. I'd just like to know... How much will it cost? Just as a point of interest. We need another 20 million yen. My father works for a small bank. - But a bank couldn't offer a loan, could it? - That's it! We rebuild the school. If you ask for donations, parents will complain and popularity will drop. So... We issue bonds for school reconstruction, 1,000 yen for individuals, 10,000 for organisations. Sorry to keep you waiting. I came without eating breakfast and checked out the equipment bid. Oh, I managed to get the successful bidder to buy some bonds! We need to talk about a board of directors. We're not allowed more than two closely-related people among our 5 directors. You as head, me, your uncle, and Rinko as the staff representative. And for another, Professor Shiraishi, who was my teacher in college. Well, I plan to ask him. - He's a professor of French literature. - Would he do that for us? Well, we get on very well. I reckon he'll accept. Why are you making Rinko a director? Well, when we expand it will put a burden on the staff. In order to keep the staff under control, we add Rinko, to smooth things over. I've been trying hard to cope but please ... - Take me home with you! - No. I moved so we could think things through, calmly. You've changed. I can't relax in a place like this. Let's go to your place and talk. I haven't seen you for two months! Isn't it strange that I don't know where you live. Bearing in mind our relationship. What if something were to happen? What could happen? I moved so we could stop worrying about each other. - It's a bit awkward! - It's awkward? Is there a reason why going to your place would be a problem? What's going on? It looks like I'll have to agree. Let's go. - Goodbye! - Thank you! Do you have any more cigarettes? Go buy some then. I've run out too. Give me one pack of Peace. Ah, thank you. Take me to Nishinomiya. Hello? It's me. Was your behavior just now just a joke? Some kind of hide-and-seek? Or were you serious? Are you there? Well, which is it? The latter. - So, you're serious. - Yes. So we won't see each other any more. You dumped me in front of everyone! The utter humiliation of it, you wouldn't understand, it seems. I'm just a guy from the sticks but... I know what's decent. Please go ahead. Seiwa Sewing-School. Osaka main campus... I would like to offer my congratulations on your opening. I would also like to express my admiration and respect for the management. 30 years ago, when I wanted to open my first school I thought hard for a year before I finally made up my mind. It took a further year to prepare to open... And we finally opened the school in the third year. But you here at Seiwa... I hear that you started after only 4 brief months of construction. That's amazing! I admire and envy you. The prudent management of schools we have had hitherto... Through this opening of a rival school in the heart of Osaka... is hugely significant and will have a wide impact on dressmaking education in general. I believe it is an experiment that makes us all very thoughtful, about a great many things. At first I was embarrassed about being a director of a dressmaking school. But Ginshiro pushed and pleaded with me. I remember, I went to give a lecture in Kyoto when we first discussed it. Yes, yes, whatever. But if I could get your name at the top of the board of directors, official trust in the school would be high. If there's anything you want, anything at all... Isn't that rude to Professor Shiraishi? It's disrespectful. You're still just like a student and say it straight. I don't expect anything from you. The only thing I wanted was for you to stay on at the university. Ouch! Pressure! You went to a trading company with a high income rather than staying as a postgraduate. You quickly started some back-room dealing. Now you're manager of a dress-making school. I joined the board of directors out of curiosity about you. I'm sorry. It's just us guys talking. Please excuse me. This is... This guy sets unachievable targets. But his passion and energy somehow achieve it. Don't get swept away and lose yourself! What does that mean? Your compliments are barbed. I'm not the sort of guy you think I am. Won't Shikiko be angry, us being out for a drive? I'm just the manager, she wouldn't be interested in somebody like me. Really? I think she's become quite sexy. She's intelligent, rich and from a good family, but that's not what attracts men! - And Rinko? - Rinko? Well, she is a looker and sexy. But she's with that Nomoto guy. - Anyway, let's race to Lake Biwa. - Biwa? Lovely! Hang on tight! Hello! I trust you're well? I was here in Kyoto so I thought I'd drop by. I'm a director but it's been so long since we met. Not at all. I greatly appreciate your hard work. I was asked to do a design for a film so I've just been to the studio. I was wondering if you'd be here. - My lectures finished early today. - I'm so pleased. Shall we go for a walk? - Yes please. - Just give me a moment. No, it's fine. I'll do it. I'm used to it. So... Who is there in your household? I live with a long-serving, 60-year-old housekeeper. It's been 10 years, I don't feel any inconvenience. Did your wife pass away? Yes, ten years ago. Looking at you... I think your wife must have been very happy. In a marriage of many many years, outsiders can look, but they can rarely see. There are some dark abysses. People who should have loved one another end up hating and hurting each other. People who should have trusted each other betray instead. Tormented between love and hatred, they hurt each other and devour themselves. If between them memories and love remain, It's neither gentle nor kind. Sometimes a person's soul can become corroded. You must have been in love? Well, yes. I don't want you to cheat on me. Could you be my wife? We can't get married. Tomorrow, we're opening a new branch in Kyoto. In Kyoto? It's a chance to build your brand. In Gojuwa in Osaka, a five-story building is being built. And in it us... Yes? The plan is for a Kyoto branch-school, about 800 people. We've only just opened the Osaka branch! It's a bad time to open another in Kyoto. Well, don't worry. The construction company will provide the fifth floor free of charge. - Your glasses. - Thanks. Well, it's a chain school and I've come up with a new business model. That sounds like a chain-store, almost like a department store. You're the artist. I'm a businessman. I'll make it profitable. Leave it to me. There are 100, maybe 200 dress-making schools in Tokyo. Osaka provides 100 schools. Maybe 100,000 students nationally. It's all within your grasp. Don't be an idiot and hesitate. Who will be in charge of Kyoto? Rinko is running Koshien, I have my hands full with Osaka... - How about Kazumi? - Kazumi? Rinko runs Koshien, Kazumi runs Kyoto. Isn't it beyond her? It's no big deal. Anyone can do it. Every time there is one more chain school. Your name as designer gets advertised. You'll get more and more famous, a snowball! effect! I'm not happy if you enter my apartment without my permission! Is there any reason why I shouldn't? I borrowed the key from the manager. My rule is no dating here. What does that mean? Has this become some sacred space for you? No, of course not. Oh, I come via Kazumi's house. Are you making home-visits to all the staff? Even if you hadn't done that, I would have been angry. I'm doing a survey of a site in Osaka. We're going to open a new branch in Kyoto and ask Kazumi to run it. Basically Seiwa is becoming a chain-school. Kazumi's father was damn hard work! He has been a banker all his life so he checks everything in agonising detail. He was such hard work. Each time a chain school is added you get another woman. If only I could! That would be fun. But I mustn't abuse my managerial privileges too much. I'll go to Kyoto. What are you talking about? If you leave Koshien, Seiwa group will be in a mess. That's how it is. The main Seiwa school is Koshien. Come on, stay over tonight. Are you sure? I thought there was a no dating rule in place here. You're an exception. Oh, by the way... The next step for us will be Tokyo! Shikiko has been chosen to receive the Osaka design award. Is there really nothing between you and her? What? Don't be ridiculous. You'll definitely get the big Osaka designer award. - That would be nice. - You've been so lucky recently. Personally, I prefer you as you used to be. What's wrong with me now? You only think of showing off, just like Ginshiro. You're not the gentle woman you used to be. We'll be busy. We'll have a quick shower at the hotel then... We need to make it to the hall by 3:30. How about telephoning Mr Shiraishi? Yes, I suppose so. Come on! Hurry up! Get the evening dress out first. I think you've put on weight! Yes. I have a good appetite because I'm in love! Oh, that's why! Please call the exhibition venue. Hello, Sankei Hall please. It's nice. It's like something from The Tale of Genji. You have good taste! This dress is called Heian. Yes? Shikiko Ohba of the Osaka Dressmaking Academy. Has the rehearsal started? Thank you so much for today. I'm a director, in name at least. I thought I had to see your show tomorrow. Your work seems to be well received. I enjoy it until it's finished but then all its shortcomings stand out. You've changed. How so? When I first met you, you were very modest. I had the impression that you were blessed with great luck. The next time I see you in Kyoto, you have become a first-rate designer. You carry it very well. Now you're a dignified and successful businesswoman. No, I'm not saying it sarcastically. Everyone wants to be recognized in some way. However, if that recognition is mistaken, or misplaced that person's life will be turned upside down. I'd forgotten the hotel was so close. Yes, that's it. Good night, then. Thank you. See you. Tomie? Please come in. - What do you want here? - That's an odd question? It seems a bit cold. I wanted to see people's response to the prize being awarded. With my own eyes. The show started at 7pm. Where were you until so late? Having dinner with Professor Shiraishi. Now is not the time for you to take a walk with him around the fashion shows. You seem to have plenty of free time! He's on our board, isn't he? What's odd about me showing him the pieces. I see. - Are you that worried? - Don't be ridiculous. What I don't like is that you seem to know it all. Thanks to the inheritance from your parents, you live without making any effort. You look down on me because I live by my wits. You laugh coldly at me. I really don't like it. Let's talk it over. How about it? I'm tired. I see. Good night, then. What is it, so late at night? We finally got the chance to be alone. Tomei-san I... So now it's my turn, is it? Huh? What are you talking about? After Rinko and Katsumi now it's me. I'm third in line. Is Shikiko going to be the 4th one? Ah! Well, if you know already... Everyone thinks I'm a bit slow and so they don't know what I'm planning. Rinko also lied about the purchase of parts. Katsumi met with you once a week in a secret place. I know everything you're doing. Thank you. I saw no profit in speaking out so kept my mouth shut. So under what circumstances might you profit? Now may be that moment. You certainly have hidden depths! - This is interesting. - Well, I wonder... I can't quite tell but... You're cute. But I'm going tell all to Shikiko. You mustn't do that! Look I... - Give them back! - If you don't do anything... OK, OK, I won't do anything. OK, you've beaten me. It looks like I'm losing tonight. I'm going to retreat before something bad happens. Sometime let's talk about something of mutual benefit. Unless it's a good offer I'm not interested. - How about the chain-school? - How about a factory. - A factory? - A sewing workshop to produce clothes. OK. Tell me about it. To beat the competition you have to design and sew. When posh department stores ask for a design we just sell it for the price of that design but we must charge more than the design fee alone. If we consolidate all the sewing work into our own factory - and sell as the finished product we'll make a profit! - Yes, I get it. See, in the factory they don't know how to set the garments properly. And so those beautiful designs are utterly destroyed. A design studio. Ohba's! We'll call the brand Seiwa-Design Studio! It will cost a bit though. I see. Thank you. Good night. Hey! Where did you go? I thought you said you were tired today. Ohba-sensei will now say a few words. The School which has opened today as Kyoto Seiwa College was established from the first one in Osaka as a chain school. And accordingly all the classes in sewing and design are taught personally by Ohba-sensei. The graduation qualification is also recognized as the same as our main school. Ah, the new field of work that you mentioned earlier... In other words, the Ohba brand garments will be made in our own factory. I was thinking about that too. Even if I think up a good design someone who doesn't understand it fully can wreck it. I thought I had to have a system where we sew ourselves, sooner or later. - This will be a big new thing in the clothing industry. - Make a plan right away. Doesn't her family run a clothing firm? She'd be well suited to the job. - Tomie? - Yes. Well, she's very organised and reliable so you're probably right. You've got a great eye for people. Just leave it there. - What do you want? - Missus... Here! It's special delivery so I need your stamp. - Is a signature OK? - Of course. - Hi! - Hi. It's hot! It's largely ready. How does it feel to be Ms. Factory manager! You're the factory manager. Please call me if you need anything. - Please relax and enjoy. - Thanks. This is a sewing factory sales contract. Here's the official seal. The property sold is... in Shitennoji in Osaka. It has a floor area of 180 square meters. Price 2.85 million yen. A deposit of 1 million yen has been paid. The school documents are in the director's name but... I secretly remade the documents during registration of contacts and put them in your name. You are the legal owner. What'll you do? Is that OK? Yes. All correct. Well then... Let's go to bed. You're very businesslike about it! Aww, it's all gone! Oh, when will be the next time? What? - When can we do this again? - This was a one-off. Ouch! That was very expensive. - Well, I was a virgin. - Yes, I know that but... From now on you'll let me make money in the factory. Or is it too expensive? You are the epitome of sly. A real piece of work! I'd better hurry home or my father will start to worry. Excuse me. Good to see you! Help! Listen, Tomie... I want you make a pattern designed by Jean Lambert in Paris! Wow! Lambert? I'm going to Paris next week to see the collection. I'm going to select a representative piece for the season. I'll pick a design that might be popular in Japan and we'll assemble and sew it here. I want to introduce real Paris fashion into Japan. Lambert is talked of as a god of fashion. Always in magazines, lots of illustrations. But nobody is introducing how to make those patterns. So, on your next trip to Paris we buy one and bring it back. Wow, I'm so glad you think I'll be able to help. My idea is to tie-up with Mitsuwa and ask for foreign currency. Nomoto is in the sales section, isn't he? And if you use your tricks on him... No, I won't. I... I can't meet Nomoto! You feel you've done something horrid to him but... Actually that makes him yearn for you all the more. Rinko... If you succeed in this task my idea is to make you head of the next school... in Tokyo. You can use him. And not using him isn't like you. Hello! I'm sorry I didn't tell you it would be me... I hoped it would be! Oh, I see. And how have you been? Well, yes. What can I do for you? Please come in. The Mitsuwa thing is agreed so can you get something into the paper? Projects often get cancelled when you team up with foreign firms. You keep on saying it's for Shikiko's sake. I feel like I'm being used for your business and I actually don't like it. Shikiko, if you have the chance to go abroad why not go to study? Why not let her go and learn. Not make her do business? Why don't you hope for that? I felt that it was too luxurious to go only to study. Like she says! The world of arts needs real-world practical support. - Please talk to the business section for us. - I see. Did you come to see me just to say that? I'll help as much as I can. I'll get the company to cooperate. My boss is here at the moment in fact. Shall I go and get him? Nomoto-san... I'm sorry. That's it! Mitsuwa Weaving, our sponsor, also deals with France, so foreign currency exchange is OK. You're very enthusiastic. Well, it's not just for the improvement of Japanese dress-making, is it? Lambert only sells one pattern to one company per country! If he sells one to our school, anyone who wants to learn his design has to come to us. It's business. But it certainly would also play a role in improving Japanese dressmaking. You're quite a smooth-operator! Well, pull it out a little more and show the softness of the material. Rinko, I want you to help too. When Rinko does it... Any material creates a beautiful silhouette. Rinko's tacking, Tomie's sewing... Tatsumi's accurate designs... The Lambert pattern will be quite excellent. A call from the newspaper for you. Take it off for a while. Yes, this is Ohbashi. Yes. January 31st, at 10pm We're flying from Haneda with Air France. The negotiations with Jean Lambert have gone well. Huh? Any technical concerns about being able to assemble the Lambert patterns? No. Of course I don't mind you asking. It's a fair question. The pattern is similar to what we do here in Japan. But this one has a lot of three dimensional aspects. You need a good level of analysis and understanding to deal with it. One needs ability to put it together. Not at all. Thank you. Goodbye. Well, it's five o'clock. Let's make the rest of the changes tomorrow. You don't have to clean up. Take the car and ask the driver to drop you. I still have things to do. Well, I'll go first. See you! Bye! Owner = Tomie Ooki I forgot something... I wonder where I put it. Presumably this? That's it. Thank you. We were so busy talking and I forgot it. I looked inside! Why is the property declaration of the design studio in your name? It was given to me. Well, I got it from Ginshiro. - From Ginshiro? - Yes. - Surely you and he haven't... - I was third in line. Third? My competitive spirit was roused and I agreed to his terms, just like the rest of you did. I see. All right, all right. - Please leave. - Of course. Look, I'm sorry. Hello. What are you doing here so late? Shall we go eat? I'm thinking about being just a quarter. What? I know now that my body is only one of four. Only a quarter to you. Oh. I see. Well, if you know, there's nothing to say. - I want us to break up. - Break up? Why? I can't bear this connection with you being no different than my apprentices! Unlike Rinko,Tomie, and Katsumi... my feelings for you were not vulgar, nor calculating. Really? You relied on me to get money, fame and success, thanks to me you got them. Compared to you they are just sweet little nothings. What an awful thing to say! Look, while speaking of good work and great design, in your heart you want all that wealth and fame. But if you want to break up, that's fine. End our physical relationship? Or our business one? I want to settle both accounts. In which case I'll sue for 20 million yen in damages. What? Damages? A suburban school with 200 students is now an HQ in Osaka with branches in Kyoto and Koshien. You thought it was just you that created a school of 2,700 people? During that time, I exhausted my physical strength, my time and my brains. 100 million is cheap. I was sincerely going out with you! Look Shikiko... Don't you think we should compromise as we head to bigger goals? The three of them were just tools to expand the school. So the best thing would be to pretend you don't know anything. Because you've got Jean Lambert within reach! I'll get rid of them all by the time you come back. If there is a scandal now, your reputation will be completely destroyed. You're 35 and not some innocent princess. Surely you and I have a relationship that's not so easy to end. Come on... less of the sob story. Hello? Is that the Japanese Embassy? I'm calling from Mitsuwa. Can you get me the culture section please. Hello, cultural section? Sorry to bother you, do you have contact details for Professor Shiraishi, who is attending a literary conference? I'd be grateful if you could let me know. I'm the Mitsuwa representative in Paris. My name is Kurata. Oh, thank you. Yes? Yes. I see. Thanks. Well? Can you get me the Hotel Letitzia please. Hello? Yes, my name is Shiraishi. Hello? Professor Shiraishi? It's Shikiko Ohba. What are you doing here? Yes. I see. At Jean Lambert's. I'd like to ask a favour from you. Ah, we're having trouble. There have been some misunderstandings. I met the manager at Lambert but he pretended he had forgotten our previous negotiations. A week ago, the Paris branch of Nippon Trading requested they be appointed as sole agent for Lambert. Waiter! They clearly want some trade out of this. Cinzano, pastis and a scotch. Is that OK? Of course. Everything seems amiable on the surface, but inside it's all very emotional. Do you have any mutual acquaintances that perhaps you could introduce us to? There's a painter I know who knows him. I'll have a word. I've never been of much use until now, at least here in Paris I can help. I would be delighted if you could. Hello, Ms Ohba and welcome. Delighted to have you here. Nice to meet you. Delighted, M. Lambert. She says the negotiations with Jean Lambert are going well. The Lambert show will be our great chance! Then we will break into Tokyo. Wow! Are we planning for a Tokyo branch? Serious plans for the Tokyo branch have started. A good modern workshop in Ikebukuro, Tokyo. And the school principal? That will all be after Shikiko gets back from Paris. It will have to be one of you, won't it? Me! I want to live in Tokyo. It would be best to look for a new candidate for Tokyo. By the way... I met Mr. Sone, from the newspaper. He said that Mr. Shiraishi went to France. It would be good if she realises how nice a guy Shiraishi is. He seems really kind. I'm so glad I met you. Because this has happened between us, let me tell you my tale. My wife... At the tip of the Shima-peninsula... She committed love-suicide with a student. What? At that time, I wanted to write something that would be for posterity. I immersed myself in that research. I didn't have time to consider my wife. A young wife 20 years younger than me... With one of my students, who was even younger. They found love. I don't blame my wife. I bitterly regret not being able to be kinder to her. I loved my young wife as much as I loved my studies but... But I didn't tell her. And as it was not properly formed and expressed she didn't believe it was love. Your wife was happy. If you could see inside me you'd be disappointed. I.... If you have something that troubles you it's best to get it out in the open. Let's walk, shall we? I've missed being on Tatami. Boss! There's a phone-call from Mr. Ginshiro. Tell him I've gone to bed. Oh, and... I'm going to get married. To Mr Ginshiro? No, to the professor. Well well. This is the sign for the outside. - Good? - Yes, good. Thanks. Well, it's a red ground... Town-wear with a sideline... The satin hat is a completely different fabric to that of the dress. It's just like a tsunokakushi design, but with a western feel. No, wait! The explanation hasn't finished yet. Yes, you're right. Stop the music. OK try it again. How about doing a turn? Yes, that's it! Got it? OK. It goes with the western style but also with the oriental. That's much better. Next is the wool floral with the tulle lace. A bold cocktail dress. Excuse me, let me show you to the room. Ginshiro, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Well. Greetings. Almost ready now. Tomorrow! I just hope it goes well. Ginshiro... There's something I want to inform you of. Thank you very much for taking care of Shikiko in Paris. Well, yes. It's about Shikiko and me. I heard about you and Shikiko. Knowing this, I still want to welcome her into my life. - In other words, you plan to marry? - We do. You're serious? For that reason, I want you both to clear your previous relationship. I want this Lambert job to be the last you do together. It depends on how much it's worth. She's been an irreplaceable asset to me until now. With so many obligations. It's not so simple to end. - You... - Professor, please... Don't say that! I will. You are... Who can't think of relationships as trust or love or tolerance. So as long as the calculations fit your feelings, that's OK? Pretty much! I'll give you all the profits of the Lambert work. Is that all? - And the main school in Osaka. - And? - And the Kyoto school. - And? - I'll give you both the new Tokyo school buildings? - Is that all? The only thing left is Koshien. There's nothing more to sell. The schools are all mortgaged so we can't do anything with them. They're what? Osaka main school borrowed 15 million yen as security for its construction and the school building was collateral. The Kyoto equipment is also all collateral. To buy the land in Ikebukuro for the Tokyo school. You did it without my permission! You must repay it. That won't happen. It's all in your name as chair of Seiwa. It's all your responsibility. Fraud! - You tricked me! - What the hell are you talking about. Didn't you know what was being done with your own seal? This is the thing you hate the most I know but... It's exactly as you heard. I don't think that's bad at all. - Is that all that you're going to say? - Yes. - That's everything. - Get out. OK. If you'll excuse me. It's a black afternoon-wear with a lizard-skin belt, silver necklace... a dressy outfit with a fur to accent the whole thing. Let's give up our plans to get married. As long as he insists that only money can solve the problem, there will be no solution other than paying out. It may be cowardly but I'm powerless. I don't have the confidence to marry you in the face of his opposition. Please don't abandon me! It may sound cruel... But when I heard you and Ginshiro talking just now its form differs, but you seem to have similar views on the value of money. In that respect, you and I live in different worlds. I can't keep up with that world. Sensei, what should I do? The school debts are in your name. You must keep on working and repay them. And break up with him. At least let us part without making an unseemly fuss. I'm 50 and you're 35 and we both have our careers. We can split up. Shikiko isn't here, so where could she be? Maybe she went to Professor Shiraishi. Shut up. Leave me alone. Hey. Shall we call Shiraishi's and ask? By the way, there's still time. Let's wait a little more. Hello, yes. Yes, Tomie? In Osaka? She did what? Hang on... Yes, it's Rinko. What? She... What's she done? At the Koshien school this morning? What happened? Yes. Yes. Understood. She killed herself. In the classroom. With scissors. She bled to death. They couldn't save her. Oh, my god! I'll fly there immediately. Can you continue the show? Who cares about the show? I'll stand in for her and do the welcome speech. Trust me, I will make it a great success. I don't want that! Oh, Sensei! I'm so sorry. For everything. She stabbed herself in the throat with the scissors and died. She had lost the most. Rinko, Katusmi, and me. We are all independent and benefitting. Just like a woman from a good family that she was, she chose a good way out. She's lost most. Mr. Yashiro. People from the newspapers are here. I don't want them here. Please meet them in room 203 over there. OK. - Thank you for coming. - What a tragedy. Why did she do it? The Lambert show is today: what's going to happen? The cause of her death? She wasn't in a relationship with anyone. That I can say categorically. In my opinion, the Lambert show may have been the cause. - The Lambert show? - What do you mean? The Lambert 3-D pattern haunted her. She was deeply doubtful of her own ability. She was confronted by Lambert. I think it's a beautiful and appropriate way for a designer to die. - What? So, there's nothing else? - No. Surely there must be more. That's all I can say right now. Right, let's be off. My condolences. You came? Have you informed Professor Shiraishi? No. I met him about a week ago. Why didn't you tell him first? You should have telephoned before you flew back from Tokyo. It isn't you or me that she would have wanted to come first. It's him. You're a sentimentalist, as usual. Will you be in time to get your story in the evening edition? I won't be silent and write your clever lies. You calmly use Shikiko's death for advertising. You need to obtain a proper conscience. You're not human. - What are you doing? - We're taking her to the morgue. I see. I'll go with you. No! Not the likes of you! Don't go near her again. I see. The End
