WOMAN: Set dresser to the stage. MAN: Check lights. Hey, where's that turtle with my narrator? Singing, singing, singing singing all day long When I'm singing, there is nothing that is wrong Musketeers, hey! La, la, la, la, la, la, la WOMAN: Talent to the set, please. MAN: We're live in 60 seconds. 60 seconds! WOMAN: Where's the narrator? Monsieur narrator. Monsieur narrator! Monsieur! Monsieur, it is time! (GRUNTS) (GROANS) (SPEAKING IN FRENCH) But today is the day, right, monsieur? Because you promised I can sing my songs about the Musketeers, right? (CLEARS THROAT) All for one... Hey! Huh?

Don't just sit there like a turtle. Do something! You're on camera! For crying out loud, say something! (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY) (SPEAKING FRENCH) MAN-. Tell the story. Ah... (CLEARS THROAT) Today, I will tell you the story of... Da da da! The Three Musketeers! This is my favorite version, the one with pictures. And, of course, my songs. (LAUGHS) Our story begins... In the gutter, where poor young street urchins Mickey, Donald, and Goofy struggled to survive. Zut alors! Bad guys. Will anyone defend these innocent children? Anyone! Anyone! Anyone! Well, anyone? (LAUGHS) The Royal Musketeers! - (FIGHTING NOISES) - Yes! And after the dust settles, a kindly Musketeer gives Mickey a gift. (CHUCKLES) Don't worry, Mickey. You'll grow into it. From that day on, Mickey, Donald, and Goofy dreamed of being great Musketeers. (SIGHS) But as the years passed, their dream was still as far away as ever. You see, before their dream can come true, our three heroes must learn the real meaning of the Musketeer creed, "All for one and one for all!" And I just happen to have a song about this! (HORSES NEIGHING) MUSKETEERS: All for one, hey! All for one and one for all Musketeers sing All for one and one for all If you dare to Cross our path, prepare to fall 'Cause we'll fight you All for one and one for all And all for one and one for all And all for one and all So, if you think you'd care to Kick some derriere, you Know that as a Musketeer you'd be so fearsome If you believe you're manly Come and join our family Soon we'll make sure you're a Musketeer Aw, look at them, fellas.

Janitors today, Musketeers tomorrow. (PLUTO BARKING) Hey, my lucky Musketeer hat. Aw, thanks, boy. (RUFF RUFF) Remember when the Musketeers gave me this hat, Pluto? They even autographed it. See? - (RUFF RUFF) - Oh, I can't wait to be a great big hero. Ow! Careful, Goofy. GOOFY: Sorry, Mickey. I can't wait to be a Musketeer neither, 'cause I got plenty of good ideas. The Musketeers can use a clever fella like me. (GASPS) Yipe! Hey, Donald, how about you? Are you kidding? Musketeers need guys like me that are brave! Yeah, and they need guys that are brave, too. That's what I said, brave. (RUMBLING) (EXCLAIMS) (CRASHES) (LAUGHS) (SINGING) Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sirree. I've been looking forward to this all month. Maybe I can sand it out. (GASPS) Huh?

I am sick and tired of your screw-ups. You guys are hopeless. I leave you for five minutes, and I come back to a disaster! We were practicing our teamwork so we can be good Musketeers. Musketeers? (LAUGHING) Whoo hoo hoo! (COUGHING) (LAUGHING) Oh... Mmm! That's priceless. But we could work really hard and prove ourselves, Captain Pete, and then would you let us be Musketeers? Well, there's three things wrong with that. One. (CLUCKS) You're a coward. Two... (TELEPHONE BUSY SIGNAL) WOMAN: We're sorry. The number you've reached has been disconnected. Oh, you're a doofus. And, as for you, well... You're just too small. Why, I wouldn't have you yahoos as Musketeers even if you were the last recruits in all of my beloved France! (HONKS) (POPS) So, you won't need this, will you? Yeah. Here, kid. Have a ball. (LAUGHS) Have a ball! Ooh, that's a good one! I'm going to send that one in to the digest. (LAUGHING) (DOOR SLAMS) (FAN FARE PLAYING) He loves me. (SIGHS) He loves me a lot. (BLOWS) He loves me. (BLOWS) He loves me even more. (BLOWS) He loves me. Pardon me, Your Highness... (BLOWS) You're kind of mangling that flower. Who's the, uh, lucky guy? My one true love. (SIGHS) I'll find him someday. He's out there. I just know it. This fantasy man, do you happen to know if he's royalty? Does it matter? Well, as you know, someone of your royal stature must be courted by a gentleman of royal blood. What a royal pain. Your Highness, you're gonna have to pick someone sooner or later. I mean, tick-tock, huh? Daisy, I can't pick someone I'm not in love with. You want love? Buy a dog. Besides, the perfect guy isn't gonna just walk through the door, and even if he does, how are you gonna know he's the one? (GIGGLES) Oh, I'll know. Just imagine. He'll stride into the room. A light will glow from him. I'll hear music. He'll bring me flowers. He'll sweep me off my feet. And I'll know he's the one when he makes me laugh. (GIGGLES) Your Majesty, forgive me for saying so, but that sounds just lovely. Trust me, Daisy. I'll know him when I see him. (PLAYING LUTE) Why bonjour. (PLAYING LUTE) (SIGHS) A romantic princess deserves a romantic song, no? Just around the corner, seeking you Puppy love is tripping lightly into view Hiding in the hedgerows Sneaking up on tiptoes Love's first kiss is blissfully About to capture you Just around the corner, wafting close Love is creeping nearer than you might suppose So sit still and wait now Let love choose your fate now Take a pause, don't run because It's right behind you Let love find you Young love It's love, love, love, love, love Love so lovely What can you say to love But love? Maybe on the rooftops, climbing high Somewhere just above you Love is hovering by Love is in a rush to Smear you, smash you, smush you Love will crush you into mush When you're the bull's-eye you'll get hit by Young love Your first, your only love Love so... DAISY: Excuse me. Your grace. How can you stand it so... - (SCREAMS) - Your Highness! (GRUNTS) Who's gonna tell the bloomin' boss the bad news? Don't look at me. I ain't saying nothing. You tell him.

(GULPS) He's not going to like that. (DOOR CREAKS) Hello there. It don't look good when only one shows up. Does it, small fry? (DOOR CREAKS) Hmm... Blimey. I can't hear nothing but step, clop, step, clop. (MURMURING) Have a gander at monstro's better side. (LAUGHING) (SCREAMS) TOGETHER: He has something to tell you, boss. It better be good news. We did exactly what you said to do and dropped a safe on the princess. You what? I didn't say, "Drop a safe," you dolt. I said, "Keep her safe." Well, that's good, because we missed her. Now listen, you mutts. I got a plan. And it ain't to kill the princess. It's to kidnap her. TOGETHER: Huh? The opera, it's tomorrow night. (OPERA SINGING) The princess has got to be gone by then, or I can't become king. TOGETHER: Oh... I don't get it. Lieutenant Clarabelle! (SPEAKING IN FRENCH) You bellowed? Throw these clowns into the pit! Oui, oui! La pit! No! Not that! Anything but la pit! Bon voyage, losers. (DINGING) (SCREAMING) Oh. Not so bad. (RINGS) Bonjour. Pete's secret lair.

(LAUGHING) No. Just imagine, guys. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but someday Captain Pete's gonna march in here and say... PETE: Congratulations, boys! Huh? You passed the test. I've been watching you three, and I'll tell you what. You guys have got what it takes to be Musketeers! Really? You mean it? Cross my heart. Oh, Boy! Hey, fellas! We're gonna be Musketeers!

He pulled an ax on me. PETE: Your Royal Highness, I have never ever had a more highly skilled group of gentlemen than the individuals which I present to you today. Seems like this is gonna take a while. I'll go get you a little snack. It took my highly trained eye to see their true potential. Yes. Well, France thanks you and your eye very much. Well, then it is without further ado that I present, for your complete safety and protection... (CHUCKLES) Your Musketeers! (ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING) MINNIE'S VOICE: Just imagine. He'll stride into the room. Light will glow from him. I'll hear music. He'll bring me flowers. And he'll sweep me off my feet. And I'll know he's the one when he makes me laugh. DAISY: Your Majesty, it's time to cut the cheese. Huh? What? Here we are. Roquefort, anyone? - Knife! - Bad guy! Grab her! Oh, no. (SCREAMS) Help! Unhand her! Release her! Stop it! Drop her!
