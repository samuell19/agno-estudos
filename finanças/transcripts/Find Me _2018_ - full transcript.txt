Joey was so cute and funny. Come on, "Friends" was awesome, right? - You mean that show where only white people are in New York? - Whatever. So? - So I guess the Q3 numbers are a little off but I'm just gonna change some things in there. - What, no, no, no. Aren't you gonna ask me about my trip? - Hey, you've been gone? I didn't even notice, oh. - Oh, okay, yes I've been gone. Check that shit out. - Oh damn. You get that close to a grizzly bear? - Yup. - That's stupid. - I know, it's pretty sweet, right? - No, I don't mean like your a millennial cool hip stupid, I mean that's really stupid. Those things can kill you. - What, no. Joe, there's a ranger present. And you know, there's so much salmon around, those bears don't even care we're there. God, seeing those bears in the wild like that, life changing. - Well, I'd never do that. - Awesome. Is it up on the server? - Up and ready to be seen. - Hey, question. Can't you force Joe to take vacation time? I mean, before he completely loses any semblance of a life? - Well then who's gonna make up for all your work? Are you flipping me of, Amelia? - Maybe. - You have been taking a lot of vacation time lately. I mean even for you. - Hey, there's a lot to see out there. We're not getting any younger. Especially you, grandpa. - That's easy for you to say, miss no kids and no infirm mom to take care of. - Okay you know what, will you stop that? You treat your divorce like it is the end of your life. Ever just thought of it as a restart? What, we're not in the final act of Joe's life, it's just act two. - Joe is fine. Joe doesn't need Amelia's judgment. - Well it's Joe's storm 'cause he created it. Joe needs to get his ass out and about. - I've been charged with making sure there's universal format for our nomenclature this year. So I may need one or more persons to help, thanks. - What's Amelia doing? - Amelia is just typing a letter to Carol for Joe because Amelia knows Joe likes her. - What's Amelia talking about? Amelia has to stop. - Amelia sees how Joe lights up when he talks to Carol so she's just helping Joe get on it. - Joe doesn't need Amelia's help. - How does Amelia send this thing? - Joe's getting really agitated. - Okay, Joe needs to calm down. - Amelia needs to stop. - Okay Amelia will stop in two seconds, once she figures out how do you send this thing. - Amelia, no, no, no. Oh! - I don't know. There's just this vertigo I've been getting every once in a while. - When did that start? - I don't know, sometime after the thing with my wife. - Ah, divorce. I think that's the word you're looking for. - It only happens when I get stressed out about stuff like when someone tries, emails off my phone without asking. - Oh come on. Amelia was just trying to help Joe out. - Look, I'm just not ready for that looking for a new mate thing right now, okay? - Ugh, give me a break. You got to break out of this cycle of nonexistence. Seriously, man up, Joe. If you're not gonna go out and meet people, fine. But you need to go out into the wild and find your inner Joe. - Inner? I get out, I mean I, I went on that trip to Grand Canyon, remember that? - I do remember that. That's that Costco tour that you took with your parents in a bus full of old Asian people. You sat on the bus and then got out to see the canyon, and then McDonalds. - First of all, let me tell you there was at least, one or two people that weren't retired yet in that bus, okay? - Yeah, you were one of them. - And second of all, I'm not like you. I don't like backpacking out to some remote canyon so I get trapped by a boulder and I have to cut my arm off with a pen. - What? Did you recently watch 127 hours? - Yes. - But, the scenery in that movie. Epic slot canyons. That was awesome. - Yes, that was cool, okay? - Yes it was. Yes it was. You even watched that movie and I'm telling you, you can experience that really, really easily. I can give you a list of like a dozen places that you can go to. You just have to walk for a few minutes and you find yourself in these god-amazing places. They're really easy adventures. - What, you got a commission from the national park service or something? - I actually really like that, really easy adventures, hmm. - All right, can we talk about something else please? - Okay. Um, tell me what you believe in. - What? - Like do you support any causes? - I don't know, I guess I buy a calendar from the World Wildlife Fund every year. - You do? That's so adorable, Joe. - Oh my god. - Oh little animal lover Joe. Why are you staring at your finger like a weirdo? Oh my god. - You talking about like royalty clean old white guy or was he like dirty commoner old white guy? - Hmm, I think royalty. 'Cause he was with the queen. And this other old bearded hunchback white guy. - Oh you're probably thinking about her right hand man, the mad scientist kind of guy. - Oh, yeah, I can't keep up. - Why don't you just quit? - What? - Yeah I mean, you'd make like a great naturalist or a trail guide or something. Why are you crunching numbers for the man? - I guess I never really knew what else I wanted to do. Yeah, everybody just told me I should do something secure and practical like accounting. - What you have Asian parents too? - Hah, yeah. Oh and then you know Austin really wanted that big house so kinda had to take this job so we could afford it. - Makes sense. - Yeah, I guess it does. Except now I sit in my cubicle everyday hating myself, so. - Well, hating yourself everyday doesn't seem very healthy. - Why not, you do it. - I don't hate myself, I like working here. - Oh, you hate yourself. You just don't realize it but I see it. This place crushes souls into tiny little specks. - Well, if you're so enlightened, why don't you just quit? Mostly so you can stop pestering me about my life. Grandpa, you okay? - Shut up. Actually, I need to work so that I can pay for all the awesome traveling that I've been doing. God I bet you're sitting on a bunch of savings and vacation pay 'cause you live in the office 24-7. - Not quite. All this money I'm supposed to be sitting on is going towards alimony and mortgage for a house I don't live in anymore and medical stuff for my mom so she can breathe. - Oh god, you always say that. Like you enjoy wallowing in this pit of no life. - Oh yeah, I love spending every day getting bullied by my domineering alien mother. Well, I guess it did work for Norman Bates in Psycho, right? I mean he's normal, he's cool, right? - You're stupid. - Hi mom, hi dad. - Joe, where have you been? My oxygen tank is almost empty. You want me to die? - If I wanted you to die, I wouldn't be paying for all this stuff to keep you alive now, would I? Besides you have like half day left on your tank. - Oh, maybe, how do you know? The new tanks were delivered this morning. - Dad why can't you do this again? - I can't really turn the knob with my right hand. - Dad's right, you should move in here, help us out. - Well, if I do that, mom, then eventually I'd have to kill myself and you'd have no one around to help. - Oh stop talking stupid. You know, the new neighbors, they moved in last week. A bunch of Indians. They have a dog, it barks and barks all night driving me crazy, right Ming? - Huh, what? - Dog, the stupid dog next door. - Give him samosa, it's a curry dog, you know? - What curry dog? - I like the smell of curry. - Hey Joe, how's it going? Chicken combo, steamed veggies and fries? - Have I ordered that before? - Let me get a chicken combo, steamed veggies and fries. - They've come across the lake from very far away, from any other sight that we've seen through our time show. They're forming this for quite a while. The lions are closing in on a leopard that's killed a young, - Hello? Hey. - Daddy! - Hey, goofball. Ready to see the awesome dentist? - I don't like the dentist, I don't want to go. - That's just great. Oh look, look what I got you, a book about the stars. - Oh, cool dad. - Cool. Uh, hey Joyce. - Hey. - So what'd you do to the front yard? It's all different. - Oh yeah just some stuff I wanted to change up for a little while. Um hey, thank you for taking him. I completely forgot about it. - That's fine, just next time, just give me earlier notice. - Yeah, okay, sorry. So just remember, after the dentist, straight to school and then my mom's gonna pick him up. - Oh, okay. I could take him if you want. - No, no, it's fine. Wilson's been looking forward to hanging out with my parents. - Actually, I'd rather-- - Wilson. - Well, I mean, if Wilson wants to come with me, it's cool. - No, no, my parents haven't seen him for a few weeks and they really wanna see him, so, it's fine. - All right, okay fine. - Okay, great, thank you. And I will see you tomorrow night, honey bunny. Listen to Nana, okay? - Mom's going to hang out with Doug in Palm Springs. - Who? - That's her new friend she hangs out with. I wasn't supposed to tell you that. - Hey Wilson, why don't you check out your book about the stars? Wilson? Wilson. Okay. Hey. - Hey. - You're like the last person I thought I'd find here unusually early in the morning. - Yeah, it's sad, right, I'm becoming like you. - Oh, I see. What, you take the afternoon off and go ride polar bears in Antarctica or something? - There are no polar bears in the Antarctic. - Right. - No, I just needed to get out of the house. - You all right? - Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Just couldn't deal with Austin this morning, so I had to get out. - Um, you wanna talk about it? - No, no I'm fine. - All right. - Why are you here this early? - Well I'm hear because Joyce browbeat me to take the kid to the dentist at 6:30 in the morning. - Mm, you know since you're divorced she shouldn't be able to browbeat you anymore. - Oh, thanks for emasculating me even further. - You guys done with the copier? - Um yeah. - Hey Joe. - Hey, how you doing. - And Amelia. Unusual seeing you here this early in the morning. - Really, Tanner? - I think I'm done. ♪ Oooh aah ♪ ♪ Oooh life ♪ ♪ Goes on ♪ - In the winter I wanna help with the hernia and take away that risk but I don't wanna do any harm. - She said she'd been seeing Austin for months and had no idea that he was already married until she saw us together. And she was so shocked and so mad, and, I just looked through his browser history and he'd been on all these dating sites. - Oh man. - And it just came just sort of crashing down on me. - I'm sorry, Amelia. Hey, it's gonna be okay. - I know we had problems but, I never thought he would do something like this. - Yeah. - I just feel so stupid. - No. Look, things happen, all right? Just, it'll be all right. Just give some time, all right? It'll be okay. - Okay. I can trust you, right? - Yeah. Yeah, of course. Hey. And she's gone. Shit! Come on. - Hey, Joe. - Hey, what's up? So uh, what's up with the police looking guy over there? - Oh, you mean the actual police? Yeah, they're here about Amelia. She took that week off a couple weeks ago but we haven't heard from her since. You still haven't talked to her, have you? - No. Usually when she goes on vacation she just lords it over me and I didn't even know she was gone. Actually, I'm kind of worried about her. - Look, she didn't ever mention anything to you about taking money from the company? - What, like embezzling? No, I mean you don't think she could do something like that, do you? - Actually, we kind of know she did. A few weeks back they were doing regularly internal audits and discovered about $30,000 missing. - Jesus, seriously? - Well, she actually sent the money to various charities in our name. - Well, how do you know it was her? - She put her name down as the contact person. She sent money to places like the Sierra Club, the World Wildlife Foundation. Whoah, whoah, whoah, dude, are you okay? - Uh yeah, yeah, I just, just surprised that she'd do something like that. Are you gonna get the money back? - Are you kidding? If word gout out that we were taking money back from charities, that would be very embarrassing for the company. Nah, I mean, we can afford it. It's just a write off, I'm sure she knew that. I'm actually impressed with her little stunt. - Uh, thanks. - All right. Thank you very much. - Good luck. - Hey. - Can I help you? - Yeah, you're Austin, right? - Yeah, yeah. Do I know you? - I don't think so. I'm Joe, I work with Amelia over at Kentex International. Actually I'm here because you know she hasn't been around for the past few weeks and everyone at work's kind of worried about her. Do you have any idea where she might be? - Yeah, see that's the thing. I'm not so sure myself. See she's been going on these travels lately so at first I wasn't too worried but this time she's, she's been gone a while. I don't know where she went or why. - Really, you have no idea why. - Well you know Amelia, she gets these, these crazy ideas in her head. - Yeah like maybe you sleeping around? - Excuse me? - Uh yeah I think you heard me. - Maybe you should leave. - Maybe you should stop being an asshole. - Hey, you got a problem? - Oh jeez. Oh god. - Hey, hey calm down, calm down, all right? I don't wanna hurt you, okay? - Okay. - Look, if you're calm, I'm gonna let you go, all right? - Okay, okay. - You calm? - Yeah, yeah. Jesus. - God. Look, I'm not proud of what I did. - Look, I don't have to hear any of this, right? - Look, I just, I couldn't connect with her anymore. I reacted badly. I mean this last year, she's, she's been a loner. - Wait, what do you mean? - I mean she has no friends. I try and take her to parties and hang out with my buddies, but she just, she just quiet, she doesn't talk to anyone. - Wait, Amelia not talking? - Yeah, isn't that, isn't that how she is at the office? - Uh, not really. - Yeah. Yeah, she, she used to be happy around me. Have you ever had someone just stop loving you? - Um, yeah. - What? Why do you have to go? - Just for a few days, mom. I'll stop by on my way back. - You want me to die? - You're not gonna die, all right? You're set for at least a week and Jim from next door is gonna come by. - I don't want him to be here, he smokes. - He's not gonna smoke in the house, all right. Look, it's the best I could do last minute, I'm sorry. - What's wrong? - Oh, nothing, I'm just catching my breath. - Where are you going? - I just gotta go, mom. - What, you don't have to go! - Ugh, dammit, stupid vertigo. Well, let's do this. - My dear old man Joe, I have compiled a series of places that I think you should get out to so you can have some easy adventures. I've set up a few general rules as to what an easy adventure is. One, it has to be some place out in nature that is unique and amazing. Like make you feel you are in another world amazing. Two, it should be relatively easy. No long brutal hikes, no big mountains to climb, no crazy equipment, and definitely no open desert bike riding so you can fall into a canyon and have to cut off your arm. And three, you should be kind of alone on these adventures. No big touristy crowds that totally takes away from the experience. There are a few exceptions because some places you just have to see. Generally though, if it's gonna feel like an adventure it needs to be just you and nature. - Can I help you? - Actually, I'm not sure. - You staying here? - I don't know. You know, can you tell me if you've seen this girl around? - Uh, you Chinese? - What? - Chinese, you a Chinese guy? - Yeah, Chinese-American. Why? - Your friend left that, said a Chinese guy named Joe might show up. Give him that. - How long ago was she here? - A while ago. - Did you talk to her by any chance? What was she doing, you know? - I don't know, I just check people in and check people out. I don't follow them. People seem to find that creepy. - Yeah, I mean. - Well go ahead, take it. - Just kind of weird. - Yeah that's pretty much what I'm thinking. All righty, why don't you give me a ID and a credit card and I'll see if I can find you a room. - Finally able to get up close, Michelle will first determine whether the reindeer can handle another major surgery. - Newly green news. We know people love getting extra large coffee sizes. That's why we're making available our extra large tumbler. - Dude, Keyhole was dope. We gotta do that again. - No, Keyhole Canyon is done. Let's move on to some other Zion stuff like my bro told me. You could actually rappel down Orderville Canyon and end up at the Narrows. It's pretty sick, right? - Sweet. - Uh, excuse me. Did you say something about the Narrows? - Yeah. - What exactly is the Narrows? - It's pretty awesome. You hike through this big ass canyon with these walls that like go on forever. - Like red rock skyscrapers, like Lord of the Rings kind of stuff. - Yeah if you start at the bottom it's pretty much all nice and flat. That's what most people do. You know, a lot of families and stuff. - But if you wanna go 127 hours, like slot canyon crazy, I could tell you-- - Uh no no no no no. No 127 hours action. I'm good with flat families. - The Narrow's still pretty awesome. Just go to the visitors center and there are shuttles to take you to the Narrows trailhead. - Cool, thanks, I'll do that. You guys on vacation or something? - Oh yeah, we're buds from high school. We try to do one of these trips every year when we get a break. - Or at least until one of us gets a real job. - Yeah, I remember those days. So what kind of real job you guys looking for? - Well I don't think we know yet, right? We're just trying to explore as much as we can until we find something to be excited about. - Yeah, it's cool. - Back when I was in college, I was the same way guys were, you know. Get out of school, I was all fired up to go change the world, you know, and do something cool. - Yeah? So what'd you end up doing? - Well, I guess, instead I became an accountant. - All right, so accounting was your thing to be excited about? - Uh, actually I don't know. I mean ever since it was a great job and I was good at it, but, I guess even if you're good at something you don't always love it, right? - Right. - Well you're here now, right? - Yeah. - Are you ready for adventure and natural wonder? - Yeah, you know what, I think I am. Hearing you guys talk about it I think I'm getting all psyched up to go hike the Narrows. - Bravo. - There we go. See you there. - Thanks. - Yeah so what kind of shoes do you have to hike the narrows? - Oh, well I just brought these. Is this cool? - Oh, yeah, those aren't gonna do it, man. - Right now it's about 9:30. - Oh, excuse me. Do you know where the trail for the Narrows is? - You're looking at it. - The Narrows, baby. An easy hike to the entrance of some of the most gorgeous towering walls of rock you'll ever see in the world. The hike is both amazing and fun which is why I think you'll love it. Because how often do you get to hike in the water? Okay, so it's a little too popular with tourists for my taste, but there's nothing like it. And you can hike for miles as long as you can stand because it's all flat. The further out you hike, the less people there will be and the more awesome it gets. Best of all, there aren't any places you can get trapped and have to cut off your arm to escape. Easy adventure. Just hike in the water for a ways and then it hits you. You look up and you're thinking, oh my god, these walls.

If you're watching this, that means you made it. Oh my god! That is so awesome. Okay, admit it. Once you got out into the water and into the Narrows it blew you away, right? Anyway, man. It was really damn funny to see you open my letter. Okay, look, I hacked into the company mainframe and I turned on your webcam. Eh, bet you think I could do that shit, huh? Dude, the look on your face, you were like, what? What's happening? So confused. Oh god, it was priceless, it really was. Well, I chose the Narrows first because I knew there would be other people around so you wouldn't feel all scared getting into the water alone like the wuss that you are. But the next place you have to find won't have as many people, okay? It'll just be you and mother nature. I want you to be a traveler, not a tourist, okay? Okay, keep going. For me.

It's just like you seem like a man of adventure, you know. Think you'd want something a little more flavor, but do you, chicken it is. - All right, all right. You sound like my friend that dragged me in here. - Yeah? Your imaginary friend? - Oh, well never mind, it's something like that. Actually maybe you could help me. Do you know what this place is? I know it's like in Death Valley somewhere. - Ah, it looks like Sidewinder canyon, it's near Morland point. It's super cool, it's like a great hike, there's lots of slot canyons. Not many people know about it. - Slot canyons? Like the movie 127 hours? - Yeah. Well, no, kind of. It's more like more rocky so it's like Land of the Lost. - No, no, I mean is it someplace where I'm gonna get trapped and have to cut my arm off with a pen? - No, dummy. That like never happens. Like almost never. Look, it's super nice, it's fine. If it rains, it's bad but it's not gonna rain anytime soon. Wait, did you get my Land of the Lost reference? - Um, yeah.

Actually, maybe I won't have the chicken. - Oh, okay, well then I have three words for you. Three mushroom pizza. Shiitake, portabello, button. Four types of cheese, little tomato sauce, hint of garlic. - Yeah it does sound good. - Yeah. - I mean it sounds wild! - Yeah it's wild. Cool. - Do you know if there's any vacancies in the hotel tonight? - Actually there normally is but there's not tonight. They're kind of booked up. But me and a bunch of friends are gonna go camping under the stars. You're welcome to join us. - Camping? You mean like on the desert with like the sand and the cacti? - Yeah. - Yeah, sorry, that's not my thing. - Okay, cool. Enjoy your boring night. Hey.

Yes! This is why I dragged my ass all the way out here from Chicago. - Seriously, Chicago? - Mhmm, yeah. - What inspired you to come out here? - Well you know how Chicago's just like big time metropolis? Well like the rest of Illinois is kind of like farm land and backcountry roads and stuff like that but I've never seen any of it. Like being this city girl. So then when I went to college I started dating this guy and he was like super outdoorsy. So one day he's like, we should get out of here. We should like get out of the city. So we did, we got in his car and we drive like miles and miles out of the city. And he pulls over to the side of the road, and we're like away from all the street lights and everything so it's like pitch black. And we get out the car and we sit on the roof and he tells me to look up. So I look up and, it's just stars everywhere. You know, it's just like thousands and thousands of stars and they're all in like bunches and clusters and I'd never seen anything like that, like not in real life. I don't know, it's like, it makes you feel really small and it also makes you feel like there's just like so much out there, you know? Like so much to see and so much to do and it kind of just gave me scope. You know what I mean? - Uh, kind of? - I mean just like look up and then you'd get it. - Holy crap. - Yeah. - Huh. - Yeah. But from then on I just wanted to see the stars. Yeah so when I was done with college and I packed up all my stuff and I borrowed my uncle's like beat up old Civic and I just drove straight out there. Like it gets hot as hell out here, don't get me wrong, it's like unbearable sometimes. But it's still beautiful. - That's cool. So you meet a lot of weirdos like me? - Oh yeah, whole lot of weirdos. You're not the weirdest so you don't have to worry about it. - That's good, that's good. I feel a little better about myself. - You're close but you're not the weirdest. - All right. Just not the worst. - No. - All right. - You know the strangest thing is that most of the people that come out here aren't Americans, they're foreigners, you know. Like I think about some of the kids that I grew up with in my neighborhood, how much it would benefit them to just get out, you know and see that there's more. - Well, I'm one of those non-visiting Americans, I guess. I mean, up until this week. You know this is my first time camping? - Oh really? Ah, I couldn't tell. - It's that obvious, huh? I don't know. I love watching all these outdoor shows and all that kind of stuff so always wanted to try it and I just, life just got busy. You know, just studied all through college and then went straight to work afterwards then got married, had a kid, and I thought everything was great. And then, then I got divorced. - That sucks, I'm sorry. - Yeah. I just didn't feel like going anywhere after that, you know. It's just easier, safer to just stay at work, go back home, go to bed, go back to work. - Oh my god dude, you are bumming me out. - Sorry. - I feel so bad. - You know? I'm having fun. - You are? - Yeah. - Whoah. We did it! Mr. Adventure time. - Yeah. - Okay, you gotta shut up 'cause I'm gonna go to bed.

If this is actually Joe. Oh god, and not some German tourist who has actually stumbled upon this video on my SD card. Well, if it is. But if it's indeed my Asian American friend Joe then damn, I can't believe you made it this far. Can you? Stop rolling your eyes at me. I know that's what you're doing. I mean, these slot canyons are pretty sick, right? Yeah. And all you had to do was just hike a little bit and climb into a hole and you are in a totally different world. I know, I love coming out to this canyon. In the middle of nowhere with its rocks and its shade and its silence. It just helps me let go of my burdens. I think that's what I like about the desert. I like staring out into the distance and hearing old dramatic Star Wars music in my head. Yeah. But you made it! You made it! You got out of that building, out of town, out of your safe zone. Joe! I'm so proud of you. Yeah. You're not the only reason I decided to disappear. I'll tell you more later 'cause there's still one more place I want you to find me at. But I need you to find my sister first, okay? She lives kind of near here. Find her, tell her I love her and I forgive her. And I understand. Okay? Talk to her about me. And then come find me. Have a great hike back. - All right. - Hello? - Hey Joe, did you get my text last night? - Yeah, yeah, sorry, I couldn't get to it. - Look, I really need to do this thing so are you gonna be back tonight? - Uh no, no. I'm not, sorry. - Oh, really, okay look I might be able to push this thing to tomorrow night, are you at least gonna be back then? - Uh, yeah, I guess maybe I might be able to make it tomorrow night. - Okay, that'll be awesome, Joe. Let me just make a call and we'll see what we can-- - You know what, I can't. I'm sorry, I can't, Joyce. I can't make it tomorrow night. Can you just get a sitter or something? - Come on Joe, help me out. It's really important. - Yeah, don't you think what I'm doing is important too, Joyce? I mean last three or four times you asked me I've been more than happy to take Wilson, I mean cut me a little slack here, okay? - God Joe, fine, calm down. What's going on that's so important? - I... - Joe, are you still there? - Uh, Joyce, can you tell me again why you left me? - Seriously? We've been through this a million times. - I know, but, this time I think I'm ready to listen. - Well, look, when we got married, I was happy, it's absolutely what I wanted, what we wanted. I needed your kindness and your humor and your stability. - Okay. - But then things slowly changed for me. And when you went on that business trip to Korea and when you got back, I realized I was happier without you. - Right. Yeah, that was it. - I'm sorry, Joe. I've always been sorry about that, honestly. - Yeah, I know, I know Joyce. Look, I have this work conference I'm at so I just can't get out, sorry. - Oh, okay. Just tell me that next time. - Yeah, yeah I just wasn't thinking straight. - All right, I guess I'll just figure something else out. All right, bye. - Bye. - Hey there. - Hey, how you doing? - No, how you doing? I'm sorry, have you seen the show "Friends"? - Yeah, I know, that's Joey. He's funny. - Can I help you find something? - Uh, actually, um, do you know someone named Amelia? - Why? - Because I think she sent me to find you. - Excuse me. - Okay. - Hi, can I help you find something? - Yeah, I was just looking for the woman that was just over here. - What woman? - There's a woman that was working in the aisle over there. - Yeah, I'm the only woman working here, so. - All right, look, I just needed to talk to her about her sister. This is really important. - It sounds important, but if you're not buying anything here you should probably just leave. - Okay, all right, fine. Oh. Okay. Hey, Amelia's sister. - Oh my god, are you stalking me? - Well, no no, well I guess technically that's what I'm doing but it's not like that. Come on, wait, wait. Look, Amelia and I are office friends. I mean we hang out a lot together at work and like a few weeks ago she just disappeared and no one knows where she went and then she sent me a message saying that you might be able to help me. Okay. Thanks for stopping. - I didn't stop for you. I'm kind of winded from walking so fast. - Oh, sorry. Look, I know it's kind of awkward and weird and I know Amelia's probably laughing her ass off because she set this whole thing up, but, I'm her friend, I'm just worried about her. I just wanna find her and get back to work, you know? I just came a long way, is there any way you might be able to help me? - I don't even know if there's anything I can do to help. I mean Amelia and I, we kind of had a, a falling out and I haven't talked to her in months. - Well, any idea where she might be? - I don't know. I mean I know she's been doing a lot of traveling, and, - Oh my god, are you, is there something I said, I'm sorry, I didn't. Look, um. You wanna just walk? Okay. Go ahead, I'll just. - Um, this is my place. - Oh. Okay. Well, nice meeting you. And sorry for the trouble. - Wait. Wait, I think I'm ready to talk now. - Yeah? - Come in. - Okay. - My names Helena, by the way. - Oh, I'm Joe. - All right, hurry up, Joe. ♪ Yeah yeah yeah ♪ ♪ Yeah yeah yeah ayo ♪ ♪ Ayo yeah yeah yeah yeah ♪ ♪ Yeah yeah yeah ayo ♪ ♪ Ayo yeah yeah yeah yeah ♪ ♪ Ayo ayo yeah yeah yeah ♪ - I motion her to stop and she like looks over at me and she accidentally spills the coffee into his lap, like where his groin area is. So she's like grabbing agendas, she's trying to wipe it off. He's being gracious about it, he's like "Oh, it's okay, it's okay." And suddenly she just steps back and says "Oh my god, did I just touch your thing?" It was dead quiet. - In front of everybody? - Everybody, it's crazy. - She called it a thing? - Yeah. - Oh Amelia, she's so weird and so sweet at the same time. My god. Holy crap, it's getting late. - Yeah? - I gotta do something. - Okay. - And you should come with me. Don't think, just follow, let's go. - Um, okay. - So I was never really around for Amelia when she was a kid. But then after college, she contacted me, we started kind of actually being sisters for the first time talking a lot and hanging out and stuff. - That's cool. - Well she talked a lot about doing things and seeing the world and doing all the stuff that I got to do. But none of that happened. I specifically remember seeing her at Thanksgiving and my parents and her sort of douchebag husband were talking about how great her job was and how they were gonna get that house and have the kids, and, She just clammed up. Just nodding at everything that they were saying. And I could see it in her eyes that she was like this, like this cat looking out a window wishing somebody would let her out. It's like she suddenly realized at that moment that she was trapped in a box and she couldn't get out. - Yeah. Yeah I kind of get that. - I started to see her getting depressed. Like I could literally see her soul leaving her a little bit every time I saw her. Yeah so I could tell I was totally losing her so one day I got to her house early one morning before she got to work, shoved her in my car and drove to Yosemite. I made her backpack with me on this trail and it was just, it was just a perfect day. - Wow. - We hiked through this meadow and it was blooming wildflowers. And we ended up at this gigantic rock overlooking the valley and we slept there. And we woke up to the sunrise. And it just destroyed her. It was awesome. And then she ended up wanting to go on more and more of these trips and I ended up not having the time to do them. - Wow, so actually, she just wanted to be like you. - Hmm, I don't know about that. - Uh, why are we at this guesthouse? - This is my ex boyfriend's house. - What? - Yeah, he rents it out from the old people that live in the house. - What are you doing? - What's it look like I'm doing? Can you hand me that little hammer in there? - I don't know if I really want to. Why are you breaking into your ex-boyfriend's house? - Well, before we broke up a week ago because I found out he's a raging asshole when he drinks, I left my wallet in there which has my credit cards, my driver's license, a bunch of cash and a gigantic gift card for Target from my mom that I cannot lose. - Why don't you just ask him for it? - Because we broke up! I don't wanna talk to him, it's awkward. And I may or may not have egged his house which he doesn't know about it, I don't think. Look at that. I'm the female McGyver. - More like a female wanted for breaking and entering. - Oh whatever, come on. - Yeah I think Amelia was trying to get me out of my box. Kind of like what you did with her. - That's cool. Looks like it kind of worked, right? - Yeah, kinda. - You know, I do think Amelia talked about you a couple times to me. - Really? - Mhmm. - She said that there was this guy at work who made her laugh a lot and she thought that I would probably really like him. - Hmm. Something happening here? - Kind of. You're sitting on the drawers I need to go through. - Oh, sorry. - Wallet found. - Bravo. Now can we get out of here? This is the worst lost and found experience ever. - Yes we can. But in my excitement, I may have peed a little of the bottle of wine in my pants so I'm gonna go to the bathroom and meet you outside. Okay, thanks. - Okay. Too much information. Helena! Helena! - Jesus! Okay, buddy, this is private property, so what are you doing here? - Is this RD&D? - What? - I travel from Shanghai, I look for RD&D house. Is this RD&D? - No. I think you mean AirBnB. - I don't understand. - Never mind, look. This guesthouse, my place. Not AirBnB. - Okay. So is this Pine street? - No, this isn't Pine, that's two streets down. - Oh, so where is this two street? - Okay, come. Okay, Pine is the next street over. - Okay, next street over. - Yeah. - Okay. Okay, thank you, thank you. - Yeah. - Try using Chinese Google maps next time. - God, whatever crazy Chinese accent you were doing out there, that was straight up racist, dude. - Oh come on, I was just imitating my dad. - Oh, oh your dad is Long Dick Dong. - Oh my god, that is low. That is low. This Chinese diatribe saved your ass, all right? - Okay, he did, he did. - That's right, that's right. Don't forget that. - You know part of me thinks Amelia sent you here to set us up. - Well, she failed at that, right? Good morning. - Hey. Did we? - Oh come on. Isn't it early in the morning to be tearing down my manhood? - Okay, I'm sort of starting to remember. - Oh good, great. - I remember somehow staying connected to you from the couch all the way to the bed. - Really, that takes skills, man, right? - Yeah I guess. Ooh. You better go. My ex just texted me that he's coming over. - What? - I'm just kidding. - Oh my god. You're definitely related to Amelia. - You know it. Does she make out like me too? - Uh, yeah. - What? - Hmm? - Oh wait. No. - What? - You little scheming Chinese whore. You hooked up with her too? - No, I did. All right, it wasn't like that, I mean she, I... This makes things a little awkward doesn't it. - Yeah. God, I didn't know you were such a gigolo. - But come on, you didn't think I planned all this, do you? I mean nothing like this happens to me, like ever. - I kind of believe that. - Okay now I think you're insulting me. - Who's this? - Yeah I'm not sure what it means. He's the guy that started the Central Pacific railroad. His name is Charles Crocker. - Hmm. - Does that mean something? - Yeah, um. That first place that I took Amelia to in Yosemite? - Huh? - It's called Crocker Point. - Yeah, that makes sense. Probably go there first. - Hey I gotta get to work soon so are you heading out? - Oh yeah I think so. Uh, hey, um. I forgot to tell you this but Amelia in her video told me to tell you that she understands and that she forgives you. - Okay. - Oh man. I think I got you upset again. - No, no no it's good. I'm happy she said that. - Okay, good. Hey uh, can I ask you what happened between you and Amelia? - Um... Did she ever tell you that years and years ago she got sick? - No. - This was probably before she met you. She had this kind of blood cancer and she had some pretty grueling treatments that almost killed her... itself. It took a lot out of her and it was really painful to watch but it went into remission. - Oh, okay, wow. - And then a couple months ago she called me and the cancer came back. - Wait, what? - Yeah. She said she wasn't telling anybody because her doctors told her that they didn't know how long she had. - So there's nothing else they could do for her? - According to Amelia, no. They told her to go to hospice but she told me that she wasn't, she wasn't gonna go down like that. She wanted to go out on her own terms. She said she wanted to travel and live life and then when she was too tired to do that she wanted me to she wanted me to help her kill herself. - Oh god. - And I was like no. No I'm not gonna do that, I was gonna give up everything that I needed to, quit my job, move in with her, fight until my last breath but being part of killing my little sister, you fucking crazy? No fucking way. No fucking way, you know? And then we got into it, yelling and screaming and crying and then I got so mad at her. - So was that the last time you talked to her? - Yeah. Yeah we said some pretty hurtful things and then she hung up. - Oh man, like what kind of hurtful things? - I may have said that if that's what she was going to do I didn't care if she lived or died. - Oh man. - I didn't mean it like that. But that's just how it happened. - Jesus, this whole time, she's been hiding her sickness? - Goddamn her. Why did she have to get this idea in her head? Why is she so set to do it this way? It's so stupid, I should have called back sooner. I should have said I'm sorry. - It's okay. It's okay. Oh, um, there's some more photos she sent me that I don't recognize. Do you know what that place might be? - Yeah, actually. That's right in front of my apartment. - Oh. So here? - Just so you know, I may have puked in there one time when I was wasted. - Yeah well that's probably why Amelia is making me dig around here. So you wanna come with me? - I'm scared of what we might discover. - Yeah. - Go find her. - Yeah. ♪ My hands are cold ♪ ♪ They float light feathers ♪ ♪ Reaching for you ♪ ♪ To the unknown ♪ ♪ Deep in the darkness ♪ ♪ Out in the blue ♪ ♪ Can you hear me ♪ ♪ I am not a ghost after all ♪ ♪ As my bliss leaves ♪ ♪ I am not afraid to burn out ♪ ♪ Light up in the cold ♪ ♪ Is it what I hope ♪ ♪ Like a summer night ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ - I've been to a lot of places. But Yosemite still takes my breath away and brings me the most peace. Most places here are crawling with tourists. Parking lots, cars, you got a good view but ultimately you feel like you're with a bunch of people and not with Yosemite. Don't get me wrong. Seeing Half Dome and El Capitan close up is incredible and a must-do, but if you really want to experience Yosemite, you have to go into the woods and be all by yourself so that you can hear the wind, smell the trees, see the gigantic rocks that hum to you. That's why this trail is so sweet. It's pretty flat with only a few miles to hike so it's just at your grandpa speed. And the best thing is, most people don't really know about it. So with an easy hike you get to be alone with some of the best parts of Yosemite. The forest, the meadow, the streams and creeks, and everything in between. ♪ Two voices caught in time ♪ ♪ I sound like yours, you sound like mine ♪ ♪ Without your sight my eyes are weak ♪ ♪ I am your arms, you are my feet ♪ ♪ And tomorrow could be ♪ ♪ A new day ♪ ♪ Please don't let me go ♪ ♪ I said please ♪ ♪ Don't let me go ♪ ♪ With the world outside our door ♪ ♪ I'll be safer in your arms ♪ ♪ I said please ♪ ♪ Don't let me go ♪ ♪ Don't let me go ♪ - You'll see a pretty cool view at Dewey Point but keep going. ♪ Whoah oh ♪ ♪ Whoah oh ♪ ♪ Whoah oh ♪ ♪ Whoah oh ♪ ♪ And tomorrow could be ♪ ♪ Oh tomorrow could be ♪ ♪ Our new day ♪ ♪ Please ♪ ♪ Don't let me go ♪ ♪ I said please ♪ ♪ Don't let me go ♪ - When you reach Crocker Point, you'll have the most amazing view all to yourself and yet you don't feel alone. Everything there, the trees, the giant rocks, the waterfall has a presence. And they all welcome you. As far as hikes go, it's one of the best deals in the world. And one of my favorite places ever. Oh my God, Joe, you made it to Crocker Point. How does it feel to be on top of the world? Isn't this the most amazing view of Yosemite you've ever seen? And all to yourself. Thank you. Thank you Joe, for finding me. It means so much to me. You know you can be a real pussy sometimes but I knew you had it in you. I guess that means you met Helena. She's great, right? I'm guessing she told you about my condition. Yeah. I'm sorry I couldn't tell you. I didn't tell anyone. Because I needed to deal with it in my own way and I knew that everyone would screw up their lives to try to save me. But I'm at peace with it. I am. I'm not gonna be defined by this disease. I hope you understand, people knowing would have just brought me pity and sorrow and I don't want that. I wanted you to keep talking with me and making fun of me like everything was normal. So yeah. That's why I've been doing all this crazy traveling. I was literally doing my bucket list. And it was wonderful, yeah. Sorry. Hiding these coughing fits were the worst part. Sometimes I would just run into the stairwell and cough my ass off for 10 minutes then have to walk back into the office like nothing happened. Eventually it just got so bad that I knew I had to leave. But I knew there was still one thing I wanted to do and that was to make a difference in someone's life. And that person was you. Yeah, that's right, you asshole. I knew you kind of liked me. Yes I kind of liked you too, old man. But you needed to get your groove back. So I devised this little plan to get you worried about me, to draw you out so you'd come. And you did. You did. I almost didn't make it on the last hike. But I took it slow for the last mile and, it was all good. I guess planning this whole thing was good for me too because I got to hike three of my most favorite places one more time. This view is exactly what I wanna see for the last time. - Shit. Amelia! Amelia! Amelia! - Find more places to explore, Joe. Find someone to share your life with. I know someone is out there looking for you. I know this because you have given me so much by just being my friend. I'll always cherish our good times, our laughs and our talks. I love you, Joe. And I will always be with you. - Amelia. Joe's gonna miss Amelia. - Come on dad, hurry up, you walk too slow. - I don't walk too slow, you walk too fast! - Hey, look at that cool rock, I'm gonna climb to the top. - Wilson, it's a little high. Just be careful, all right? - Whoah. - Yeah, so what do you think? - It's awesome, dad, I feel so small. - Yeah, me too. - Are there more places like this? - Yeah, actually my friend made a whole list of places for us to go to. Hey, uh, you know there's another view further down at Stanford Point, wanna go check that out? - Yeah! - All right.
