"O Rama, son of Kausalya" "The sun is about to rise in the eastern skies" "Please wake up in our hearts anew" "So we can perform our daily duties due as divine rituals unto You" "Wake up within us, o' Govinda One whose flag has an emblem of Garuda" "Cast aside your sleep to bestow Your Grace and solace as the universal force" [invocation to Lord Vishnu at dawn] "O' Lord of the universe One with lotus shaped eyes" "Lord's body blended from midnight blue to His consort Lakshmi's vermillion hue" "Lord of the Venkatam hills will forgive our trespasses" "Praise be to the Lord of Venkata Mountain" "He who is the Lord of all Gods 4 faces, 6 faces and 5 faces as avatars" "You are the crown jewel Protector and Savior of all" "O' Lord, attached immensely by bonds of love of your devotee" "With your Grace and Divinity I beseech you to protect me" [Prayer to Lord Vishnu] We should learn how to be responsible only from you, ma! I am expected to be a good mother, great wife and dutiful daughter-in-law. But none of you will lift your little finger for me 3 hours since I woke up No time for even a sip of water. One of you could have offered me coffee, right? Subtle hint from your mother you should've got coffee from home! My dear Einstein husband, I got that. Amma, you know how much I missed your lamenting sessions. Divert your anger on my sari and burn a big hole I'll have a good excuse then not to turn up for the wedding today. Give me your hand. - Show me your bangles - Amma! I'll pickle you to pieces I'm so patient only because my son-in-law is here I've promised the bride's family 100% attendance from our side. If you ditch me today, that's it I won't give a damn for our family dignity and dance like a woman possessed, mind you! - You never know, she may do it. - Amma, please I'll leave immediately after my lecture. - Promise. - Wait at the college bus stop I'll pick you up at 12 We must be home by 2:00 p.m. 'Or else our imp of a daughter will bring the roof down' Sir...? My dear son... tea! Do you have an iota of responsibility? Try to be part of this family at least once. This is one of our close relative's wedding At least be punctual for the wedding feast! Every single member here expects a special invitation. [Holy chant] Isn't it ages since we attended any function as a family together? My relatives have forgotten the very fact I am married. As if he remembers he is married either! He is busy night and day romancing with his rockets. Fine, I am destined to be wedded to a scientist. My children are a few notches worse. Why did you leave out your son-in-law? Sometimes I wonder if he is a rocket scientist or an astrologer! He shifts your granddaughter from our bed and sleeps with this almanac instead of me. 'Finished your prayers?' Does it mean whoever works in NASA isn't bothered about our nation? If you were at NASA, by now we would be living in the lap of luxury, bungalow, fancy car, beefy body guar. Who is saying 'no'? Your Elizabeth is still the headhunter at NASA! Just nod your head we can leave tomorrow I didn't mean it like that. Okay, forget all these creature comforts. We have to attend a family wedding today. Can't you fulfil my desire at least 1 day? Is that so? What kind of desire? Tell me clearly what desires you want me to fulfil? - Go on. - Geetha. Bring back your imp's cradle here. - Why? - I think it may come in handy! Shankar, I'll spank you. Hey! You are saying I can still launch rockets from home? Go ahead, but those rockets will only be firing blanks! Shame on all of you, yuck! I'm going to the temple. Don't jinx it! How many times I've told you to say 'I will be back'? Today is an important day for you, right? Take care See you soon I'm going only to the temple nearby You think I'm off to Mars or what? Mars is sure to have less pot holes than the roads in Trivandrum! Uncle, today I intend seeing the KVD-1 engines assembly. Arun, haven't I told you it's inauspicious to call a person when he is stepping out? That too, a special day for him. [Holy chant] 'Bless Nambi Na ray an an and his family' 'Navakeralam' 'Nambi Na ray an an sold the secret of rocket for millions' Hey Geetha! 'Ten' 'Nine' 'Eight' 'Seven' 'Six' 'Five' 'Four' 'Three' 'Two' 'One' 'India on its very 1st mission to Mars put into orbit a satellite' 'With a price tag less than it costs to make a Sci-Fi movie in Hollywood' 'Credit to a large extent for this recent spectacular achievement' 'goes to ex-ISRO scientist' 'Mr Nambi Na ray an an' 'This special interview is anchored by none other than' 'Star extraordinaire of Tamil cinema True to his name, shining like the sun' 'Our most favorite hero Mr Suriya' Why the hell shoot on a Friday night when I would rather be partying? Looking at this 'fossil', I can forget returning to Chennai tonight. Hey! Large or small? Even before the show? You saw that fogey's beaming face? We will still be here when the sun rises! Aiyo! Make it a large then. 'I was planning to show off in front of my friends' 'Looks like he won't let me attend my reunion' 'I will sneak in and pretend to touch up Suriya sir's face' 'Quickly click a snap without anyone's knowledge' 'What the hell are you doing, guys?' 'I had to beg and beseech' 'To get Suriya from his shoot in Trivandrum, for this interview' 'If you ask him for a selfie' making an ass of yourself and humiliating me, I'll trample you. 'Try to finish the shoot and send him back to his shoot at the earliest' Can we begin? Sir 2 seconds. Quickly. Over. Sorry? Your 2 seconds are over. Sorry, sir. You will know the value of a second much more than any of us. We'll start immediately. Keep the tight close only on Suriya sir. The arrangements are excellent I hope all this is worth the effort. 'This old man is torturing us' Sorry, sir Sorry... sorry. 'Please, sir Sorry... sorry' Forgive me for asking, sir. If you think this interview is such a futile exercise. Why should we do this? Why did you come here? Why did I come? No one else in our country should go through what I had to endure. The people responsible for this crime should be brought to justice. This country may have given up on the likes of me. 'But we cannot be like that, Mr Suriya' Because I still believe in the goodness of our people. And the integrity of this nation. That's why I'm here. We share the same faith and trust in you. Our immense respect for you has brought us here tonight. Roll it... roll it. Your guru. Your mentor I've heard of Vikram Sarabhai's unshakable faith in you and your work. So can we start this interview from your interaction with him? Wow! Not reducing my entire life to that spy case and scandal. Thank you for doing the due diligence on me. 'You are right' Vikram Sarabhai. He was more than a mentor He was like a father to me. And as his spoilt, adamant son I used to enjoy going wild in ISRO [indistinct muttering] Hey quiet! Nambi, please. Coming 1 day before the test and claim the experiment isn't working is foolishness. If this can ignite here, for sure it will ignite in the upper atmosphere also. Kalam, nothing will change just by you staring at it. Let's call it off. 'Call it off?' Is this some dance drama? Start and stop according to our whims and fancies 6 nations are jointly observing us. Some American scientist said something. You concur and now chew my brains on it? Just reset it. Pump. Little more mixture please. Carbon connectors. Great! Thank you. Ignite. Five. 'Four' 'Three' 'Two' 'One' Kalaam! Look! It worked. It didn't work, sir. The vacuum valve was closed. Normal atmospheric pressure inside the bell jar. Increase the volume! - Your nose is bleeding - Hey! Give me a heads up so I don't suffer a heart attack! So 'Deepavali', the festival of lights in our office once more, eh? Sir, this morning will be special with the kind words he blessed us with. Nambi, you seem to have had your usual breakfast of 'pongal' and 'vada' With an extra dose of temerity today? Sir, you are only paying for the brilliance. Temerity comes free! I know that only too well. As long as you are here there's no shortage of temerity! But if you had shown even a glimpse of brilliance. By now one of you would have been in the Ivy League. Our institution has even offered to cover all expenses magnanimously. The extent of your magnanimity and magnitude of our talent will be known when the time comes. Dear Lord, wonder when that right time is. Only You know! Sir, I know it too. You can see for yourself. What's that? So the rumors are true? 'Where Miss Doubt exists Truth is her shadow', sir. The proof is in your hands Read the letter. Nambi. Do you realize what an incredible honor this is to our institution and our nation? If it was any other student, by now he would be floating on air. But this is no big thing for Mr Nambi, right? I don't believe doing anything in small measures, sir. 'Why should Nambi go to Princeton now, sir?' 'I need this man here, sir' But I just don't understand his obsession with liquid propulsion, sir. He is fixing selling price of ghee before buying the cow! We have barely understood solids He is jumping to liquids too soon. Sir, let's for a moment forget when, where and if I'm going anywhere. 'Just answer this question' What are we trying to achieve here? What is our current and end game? Where is ISRO headed? Nambi, don't start your sermo I'm not sermonizing, Kalam I'm merely stating facts Just hear me out. Developing solid first then liquids and finally cryogenic. Who stipulated this protocol, sir? We have no choice but treat these 3 stages as mutually exclusive. Any rocket we build that does not orbit in Space is just a firecracker on 'Deepavali' night. We need to use these rockets to launch satellites commercially, sir. In the years to come, we should also have a share in this trillion dollar market. That's the seat of prestige and power. Then we never again have to beg any nation for resources and funds. 'That should be our only goal' ISRO should follow that aim, sir. Because as long as I am here I will never allow India even in rocketry to crawl at the pace of a bullock cart. What, Kalam? Quite a full-fledged sermon actually! But what he says makes sense, right? Nambi I want to clarify a doubt. You have phenomenal faith in liquid fuels. Is it as promising as you make it out to be? Isn't the application quite limited? I knew you would ask me this. Nambi, no... no. According to James, All World Missile & Rocket Catalog. Almost 19 missiles have already been powered by liquid fuel. 'Now that you have mentioned missiles to him' 'Now he won't listen to a single word of mine' Fine, sir. Guess I have nothing left to say. Nambi, congratulations. ISRO's 1st ever export to the Ivy League! All the best. Nambi, tell me. You've been given admission into solids. How will you switch to liquids? Just leave that to me, sir. 'Professor Luigi Crocco' 'In the field of theoretical aerodynamics and rocket propulsion, a revered name' 'His was the best of the brains behind the Apollo launches' 'If I could just get to do my thesis under him' 'Definitely we can achieve our liquid propulsion dreams' 'Come hell, hail or brimstone I will make this dream come true' Fluid flows. Now... this is what we will be discussing today. So this behavioral pattern inside the shock tube is due to the upstream flow of fluids. Downstream, sir. Excuse me. Sir, this behavioral pattern is only possible when the fluid is flowing downstream in the shock tube. Great! Now we and Ascher Shapiro have to learn from an Indian rookie. And your name is...? Sir, my name is Nambi Na ray an an. So, Nambi. Let's say you are right. I am only human. I can make mistakes. But are you saying Ascher Shapiro's textbook is inaccurate? Yes, sir, it's inaccurate. Oh! Well, then. Why don't you write to Ascher Shapiro? Tell him to correct it. According to YOU. He will be very glad to hear from you, Numbu. Okay, sir. 'Maybe I'll just do that' Thank you for your suggestion! What's so funny? Hey Neil. - Hey Neil! - Sit down, sit down. - How is Janet doing? - She's fine, thank you for asking. - Good. - Neil, this is Nambi. 'A freak who wants to study liquids under Professor Crocco' And I would like you to meet another freak who put 3000 tons of explosives under his ass. Just so he would go take a piss on the moon! Sir, it's such an honor to meet you. Oh! It's an honor to meet you too, Nambi. By the way, Nambi, the old man has stopped taking any new students. He's right. Professor Crocco rarely comes to the campus anymore. His wife is really sick She is bed-ridden actually. Nambi, it's one thing to be under Crocco. It's a whole new deal getting him to approve your thesis. Take a look at my illustrious friend here. A celebrated student of Crocco's for 8 years and counting 'who is as cuckoo as Crocco!' Thank you, you jerk! Now I need another frigging beer I'll help you. Excuse me. One more, my friend. I need to go pee. You were quite a hero today at the campus. Did you really end up writing to Shapiro? Yeah, I actually wrote to him. My name is Yuri I am an exchange student from Russia, Aviation Sciences. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, Yuri I'm Nambi. I am into solid fuels as you know, but I want to shift to liquids. Oh! Really? Well, if you need any help just let me know I will do that. I actually do. Do you know where Professor Crocco lives? [door bell rings] [door bell rings] I'M NOT HOME! There. Lovely cup of tea. Just a little bit It's good for you. Just to wet your lips. Okay... good girl. No? Good morning, sir My name is Nambi Na ray an an I'm from India I'm here on a full scholarship for the solid fuel program. But I want to study desperately liquid fuels under you. Sir, I've read all your papers. Especially the theory on the relation between. Thermodynamics and fluid kinematics. What a lovely piece of work, sir. Sir, I've sent you many applications. But I can understand why you didn't reply to me. Are you serious? How did you find me? Who gave you my address? A Russian... Yuri. You are wasting your time My hands are full. What you're asking for is impossible. Goodbye! Sir, you know. For us Indians who have to walk for 2 km to get 3 liters of drinking water. And use it between the two of us for 3 days! 'Nothing is quite impossible' What are you doing? Did you just follow me back in? Look at you! You brought the mud into the house. Oh great! Then just another clean-up job for me - I don't believe it. - I'm sorry, sir. I don't know who you are but you have some nerve! I really don't have the time. You ought to know I've quit going to the campus. And stopped taking on students. My life is all about her now, okay? Alright, my darling. Have some breakfast, yes? 'Let's do it' Sir, I totally understand and appreciate what you are saying. But please, may I make a suggestion? Sir, you don't have to leave the house at all. I will take care of all your household duties Indians are very good at that, sir. Sir, I'll do your shopping for you I'll buy your provisions for you I will take care of the garden and wash the utensils and the clothes. And on top of that I'll clean the house. You know that way you'll get some quality time with ma'am and. In your spare time you could help me with my thesis, sir. It's a win-win for both of us. And I make the world's best omelets! Nambi, how did it go with Professor Crocco? - Are you on? - I am so on! That's great! By the way, can you help me with these stability configurations? Sure, no problem. But I need something in return. Can you teach me how to make an omelet?! Nambi, I'll get Ken and Beth to take you through at the liquid test facility to configure the parameters. Okay, sir. 'Dear Mr Nambi Na ray an an' Thank you very much for your letter. You are the first one to point out the printing and syntax error in my theorem. In this version of the book I am surprised that it went unnoticed by the professors thus far! But all the same I assure you it will be corrected. Thank you for pointing it out and I wish you all the very best. In your future endeavors. Mr... Numbu! From Ascher Shapiro. You have a lovely day, sir. Hey, sleeping beauty! Hi! Haven't seen you guys for a while. All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. Who is Jack? Are you serious? You know when you laugh you remind me of my son. His eyes also start smiling before his face does. Exactly like yours I have no idea you are married. Yes, you see in India it's very difficult to have a son without a wife! 'Of course' I think it is incredible what these guys have achieved. Forget the moon! At this rate we will be orbiting Pluto in no time I never thought a specific impulse of 435 was even possible. - Correct. - The Russians are done for! All they can do now is drown in their own fine vodka. Right, guys, we are going to split now. - See you later at the bar. - Okay, bye. What happened to you? They were just joking. Yankee dickheads! Getting frisky over 435. Poor bastards are going to lose their hard-on when they come to know about the KVD-1 engines 252 of them. With the specific impulse of 4 fucking 61! Just lying there in our facility. As far as interplanetary travel is concerned Americans have no clue what's in store for them. Seriously? A specific impulse of 461? You're kidding, right? Right. Forget I said anything. Hey, Yuri Yuri Yuri, listen. Can I ask you something? Are you really just an exchange student? Are you here only for Avionics? [Russian] Yesli ya skazhu Ty umresh' I ya umru. What does that mean? If I tell you. You will die. And I will die! Let's get some coffee, Nambi. So she's saying that. You can go back to the University. She's done with you, she is swapping you for an Indian husband! Don't push it. Sicilians are very jealous people. In the 4 years since her stroke. She has never smiled. Well! You are welcome. But you know, we Indian husbands are like that. We always make our woman smile. You know about our population, right? Meena...? Aiyo! Sorry, I fell asleep. - Where are you going? - Did you just come in or going out? Shall I make coffee for you or. How is Shankar? Do you remember you have a son? Of course I do and I remember a lot more. How was your flight? Our very first imaginary story! 'Isn't this Superman animated cartoon' 'A really thrilling clash?' Sir... sir...? What if we introduce a reverse shock wave into the active combustion chamber of the engine to determine instability? 'Sir, this can help us fix' 'the stability problem in the Moon Rover as well' 'What do you think?' 'So what we do is' We introduce a controlled instability in the active combustion chamber of the engine. 'In the form of a reverse shock wave' 'And observe that wave before instability sets in' - Right. - Let me explain how that is done. We have the pressure inside the active combustion chamber which is P1. We separate that with another chamber. With an inert inactive gas and put that as P2 'which is at a slightly higher pressure than the active combustion chamber' And we separate the 2 chambers with a membrane. 'Now... when you start ignition' The flames will come, burn the membrane. And therefore the higher pressure from P2 'will move into the active combustion chamber' 'If the engine becomes unstable' 'Then we know that the stability margin' 'is between P1 and P2' 'But if the engine can handle that' 'We know that we have to increase the pressure in P2' 'And keep doing that till instability sets in' Brilliant! But that would be an insane amount of variables. Insane, yes. But impossible, no. 'And it's much better than blowing up actual engines before we get it right' 'Impressive!' 'Now this is a breach of rules' You are supposed to be here for 3 years And you've only done 10 months. Sorry, I can't let you go. Here. My dear, I have some bad news. You've just lost your Indian husband! And we, our domestic help. O' Mother Goddess! Go. I'm going to miss you so much. You take care of yourself, okay? Thank you. 'This is Crocco' Get me Eugene Scott. There you are. 'This ought to be a 'dream come true' for you' 'I suppose you must be very good' Because it is not that often Crocco recommends a student! Thank you so much. And it's such a pleasure to meet you, Mr Scott. But I must tell you, Mr Nambi Na ray an an. That you are in for some real hard work and dedication. Your commit has to be absolute. - Yes, sir. - Come. - Everyone has been so excited. - I'm sure. This is a very interesting phase of our exploration. Let me introduce you to someone. A brilliant mind and a fellow American, mind you Barry, this is Nambi Nambi, this is Barry. - Hello. - Barry Amaldev. All the best Barry, take over - I'll see you around here. - Okay, bye. I knew you were coming in today. And I figured you must be missing your filter coffee from back home! - So much! - I made you some. Well, my wife made you some. Enjoy. Oh my god! 'Amme Bhagavati' This is reminding me of home so much. - I bet it does. - Yeah. You know, getting a NASA fellowship in 3 months is pretty big by itself. - Thank you - On top of that I have never heard Professor Crocco ever recommending a student to work here. You must be the real deal, Nambi! Well, it's quite the privilege and as is this coffee. But you know the... fellowship money helps I am sure it does. It's going to be a privilege to work with you, Nambi. For a man with talents like yours you are in the right place. Thank you so much. 'NASA's offer is too good to be true' Isn't it a fantastic deal? At least now do you realize your husband's true worth? The salary my father, maternal uncle, paternal uncle, my whole family can earn in 5 years. Will you get in just 1 year? No. In 1 month! Whaaat?! What do you say? Want to settle down here? Shall I accept NASA's offer? If you can't notice a cow in broad daylight what is the use of being able to see? How can you lose such a golden opportunity. 'Hey Nambi' 'Hi Meena' Hi Elizabeth, still with the solids? Yeah, but I can't wait to get into liquids with you! Let's go back to India. - Huh? - Yes. We can't burst crackers here to celebrate 'Deepavali' Or decorate our porch with 'rangoli' for 'Pongal', India is any day better. Is that so? Look at me and tell me that's the only reason. - Look into my eyes. - Let's go back. You mean it? Why this change of mind? - Tell me... real reason. - Let's go back to India. 'Bastards!' They are trying to poach my best scientist again. Nambi is very special to us, Satish. You are right, sir. We can't afford to lose him for any reason whatsoever. I think I should speak to him. Call him. - 'Hello...?' - I truly understand, Nambi. This is a lucrative offer way beyond the imagination of any Indian scientist. This is NASA, Mr Nambi. The most coveted playground for any scientist worth his salt I trust you understand what an honor this is! It's true. Also. Compared to the salary they are willing to pay you. What we are offering is peanuts I understand. And doesn't stop with a generous pay check. There's a high end vehicle. Housing allowance and an annual paid vacation for you and the family. Nambi. You are an extraordinary scientist. No doubt whatsoever. And I respect that. So whatever decision you take I will accept it wholeheartedly. Presidential offer would be the final formality. And you should have it in 2 days. 'Nobody ever refuses the President, Mr Nambi' 'Take your time' I know. It's a tough call. Tough... my foot! I have only one answer to the question, 'ISRO or NASA?' He said I couldn't refuse the Presidential offer. So I just ended up refusing him! Welcome back, my blue-eyed Princetonian. 'Nambi' I insist you continue your research in liquid fuel propulsion. Go around the world to all the liquid test facilities. And study their progress. 'And stay updated' Only then, when we get the required funds we don't have to be digging for data. I agree but NASA is out of question now Russians and Chinese won't allow even a fly into their facility. That leaves Europe. What is sir waiting for? 'I'm so glad to see you, Nambi' 'I feel like I have a little bit of India here with me' 'Yeah, there was one night in Bombay' 'I was relishing the local food on the beach' 'Good on the eyes Great on the palate' By the end of the night, I didn't know from which end I was whistling louder. And when I was a colonel in the city, I got to meet Jamshed Tata I mean what a visionary that man was! That man gave India her 1st computer center 3 years ago. I'm so impressed that you know about all this. Most people in India are not aware! 'It was our mistake, back then' 'Breaking you up into India, Pakistan' What do you know? The Domino effect goes on. Now you've got Bangladesh. Oh! I'm... I'm sorry. Am I hogging the conversation? Yes, my love, you are. Sorry, India does that to him! Oh! There's no need for apologies, Mrs Cleaver I think it's quite a compliment. You are very sweet, sir. Okay. Okay then, enough... enough about me. Why are you interested in the Rolls Royce hydraulic systems? Sir, India is at a very nascent stage of rocketry and we can't afford the kind of technology we need. 'We heard so much about your equipment and the plant' 'At the Rolls Royce hydraulic factory I just had to see it for myself' 'Sir, I was in France just a month ago' 'And we were just content reading about the hydraulic systems' 'And now, I'm here' 'Seeing the testing of fluids with such complex system of gauges' 'This is incredible!' As is this food Thank you so much for it. You are very kind. We really wish you could have stayed for New Year. Food and extra day's stay are luxuries that ISRO can ill-afford right now. So how long was your tenure in India? Well, it was long enough for the imperialist guilt to weigh heavy upon my heart! I've often wished there was something I could do in my own small way to make amends! I don't know about then. But I do know of a way now. Colonel Cleaver. It's a well-known fact that European rocketry program is on a slow burn. Because the U.S is undertaking all your rocketry responsibilities. Which also means that the hydraulic plant and all the equipment I saw today will all be rendered useless and dysfunctional. Because you'll have to move the plant. And what a tragedy that will be! But what is the setback for you could transcend 10 years of research for us in India. So I want to make an outrageous request. Give us the hydraulic plant and all the equipment. 'I know as a nation' We can't afford to pay you a dime. But we will forever be indebted to you! You do know what you are asking for is 400 million pounds worth of equipment. Even as I said it, I realized how ridiculous I sounded I'm so sorry. Please forget I asked. On the other hand, darling. He isn't asking for the Kohinoor! Oh! The lights are out. Come. You will enjoy this. Excuse me. This is so spectacular I've never seen something like this. It is indeed an outrageous request. I'm surprised you had the audacity to ask. Though it's not a remotely worthy compensation, Nambi. It will be an honor to give you all the equipment for free. As is in with my power to grant. Now what's not within my power is bearing the cost of shipping it to India. Much though I would like to oblige. You must make those arrangements. My dear boy. I don't know what to say. This is spectacular This is wonderful news. Oh! Save it, Nambi. It was probably built from money procured from India! You know this is such wonderful news I can't wait to tell Vikram sir about it. Why don't you give him a call? Give the old man a ring right now I think it's very late at night there. I'm leaving by the early morning flight I would like to see his face in person when I tell him this wonderful news. But thank you so much. 'Thank you' £400 million worth of equipment for free?! I can't believe it, man. - It's amazing! - Sir. I don't believe doing anything in small measures! On a serious note, Nambi. You know, your obsession, your passion, perseverance. Your anger, your impatience may one day dangle like a sword of Damocles! But these very same qualities will place a crown over your head too. Whatever happens don't ever relinquish your vision I'll be there for you every step of the way. 'Prominent Indian scientist Dr Vikram A Sarabhai' 'Chairman of Indian Space Research Organization' 'As well as the Atomic Energy body was found dead at Kovalam Palace' 'A Govt tourist hotel in the Southern state of Kerala' 'He was 52 years old' 'Dr Sarabhai' 'Son of a textile millionaire and friend of the' 'Flight 147 from London to Trivandrum will be landing in 25 minutes' 'Cabin crew, please prepare for arrival' Sarabhai's death was not only a setback for Indian Space Research. It must have entrapped you in a huge void too. You stood forlorn, losing your mentor. To find another cheerleader like Sarabhai to trust you blindfolded. To support your crazy, lofty dreams. It would have been really tough to find a replacement in ISRO. Mr Satish Dhawan. Vowed to support you in every which way. He promised Sarabhai. Did he keep up his word? After Vikram Sarabhai's demise. I could no longer be the privileged one at ISRO, showing off my temerity. I found a good friend and guide in Satish sir. But even that was a tiring relationship. Because I had decided to build a liquid fuel engine on my own. His lack of resources and my impatience proved to be an explosive combination. 'What have you done for the impurities in the water?' - We've installed a filter. - Guys, this is muddy water. The mud will get deposited in the filter. If that happens? - As time progresses. - Calibration will keep varying. 'Five-four-three' - This is about to explode. - 'Two-one' Stop it. 'Nambi, would you like a cup of tea?' Looks like only this hot tea listens to your ideas! Sir, is everyone jobless in the fabrication department? All they do is flash their teeth! Get lost, man! Sir, if you cannot provide me with effective and decent resources. Please accept my resignation because I cannot work like this. - Calm down, Nambi, relax. - How can I relax, sir? Everybody is blaming me for the failure of the liquid fuel engine. But the truth of the matter is I failed because of you! Are you done? I know you are being 'drama king' because of a bee in your bonnet. Be upfront about what you want to say. Sir, the world is making 60-70 tonne engines. We are crawling on the ground with 600 kg toy cars! It isn't rocketry, sir This is puppetry. Nambi, beggars can't throw banquets! Tell me what we can do with the limited budget in our hands. Our budget may be strained Is there any constraint on our brains? Time to sell our brilliant minds to convert loss into gain. What are you trying to say? Sir. For their Ariane rockets, SEP in France is developing Viking, a liquid fuel engine. It's a mega project that requires 100s of scientists and man years. We offer them our mental manpower. And in the process, first hand pick up their technology for liquid fuel engines. It's a barter. But are the French our uncles or brothers-in-law to agree to this? Sir, it's okay if they don't agree But what if they do? If they agree, am I an idiot to stand in the way? You have my hearty blessings. In that case, sir, please sign your blessings on this contract I've already spoken to the French. We have a deal. But this is a bloody good deal! So what else do you need? Learn French and be willing to live in France with their families for 3 years 52 scientists who are prepared to put their nose to the grindstone '8 months to learn French?' 'This is not rocket science' Nambi, it took me 8 years to learn English! I like that! Good... now. How do you say 'Good morning' in French? Bonjour. Correct. If any of us speaks a word of French while we are in France. Then we will all lose our jobs. And be sent back to India with a hole in our pocket! How would you say this in French? That's right. When we are in France. Zip your lips. Keep only your eyes and ears open. No one should know that we know French. 'Gentlemen' There is more to this mission than meets the eye. It may seem ordinary but we have a lot to achieve I hope all of you have read the project report. And memorized the objectives. 'In order to build our own liquid engine' 'First we need to understand the intricacies of their engine' While in France. We will do our best to rotate everyone of you in all the departments. 'Gentlemen' 'Vernon is a very small town in France where everybody knows everybody' 'We have to be very careful' 'We already have our people in these departments' Tank gauges, pressurization systems. Control elements Thrust chamber assembly. But we need to fill our people into regulators. Stage systems. Gimbal actuator systems and mainly command module systems. We need to figure out how to turn these reds into greens. Nambi, many tests are being aborted half way through. [Malayalam] We don't know whether it is because of the pressure variation. Or if it is the malfunction of the pressure gauging senses. Nambi, we need the analysis and end data of these test failures to find out the reason. And there's only one place where we can find all of this. - R-C-D - Bloody deal! RCD is one place they don't even let us walk past, forget about getting in I don't know how you will manage this, Nambi. Because we need to know what is being discussed in RCD for our know-why. Otherwise our mission is kaput. Enough, don't keep repeating it like a broken record. 'Nambi' Remember what the French taught us when we visited the Monet museum. Take a few steps back and look at the painting from a distance. Only then we can appreciate its true beauty. Yes, but what does that have to do with our discussion right now? Nambi. Viking engine has got a low upper stability margin. - What are you saying? - Yeah. The system is designed to have an operating pressure of 52.6 bars. A system like this should have a stability margin of at least 5 bars more than that. How much can the Viking handle? Like if the pressure goes up by even 2 bars. When I set eyes on a beautiful girl. And go gaga over her. Viking will vibrate faster than me. 'Height of self respect! He takes a royal dig at himself' - Nambi - Hey! - Let me introduce you to- - Hey! Barry! How are you doing? - Good to see you, man. - You jerk! After all that filter coffee last time. You couldn't bother to say a proper goodbye, huh? I'm so sorry. He is part of the advisory committee for the Viking engine. Oh! He is part of the advisory committee? Guys, this is Barry He is from the U.S. Part of the advisory committee for the Viking engine. Oh! Congrats, man. Hey, so how come you didn't tell them that the upper stability margin of the Viking engine is so low, huh? I think the alcohol is getting to him. Okay, I tried telling you I promise I won't say 'I told you so' later on. So tell me, how long have you been here? Ah, not for long. Just here to observe and assist if necessary. Are you assisting? Good. What were you saying about the stability margin? Michelle, I was saying that the. Upper stability margin of the Viking engine is a little too low. A little bit of change in the operating pressure and the engine will vibrate or worse still totally explode! No... no, that's not possible. Actually it's quite possible because you are assuming. That your fuel is as pure as the French wine! But if it turns out to be a cheap American knock-off. The engine will be drunk before you can say 'santé' Is that your Indian sense of humor? What if I prove it to you? - Shall we begin? - Yes. Param, start. Perfect! Smooth running. That will be the operating pressure we designed it to be. Yes, but what about the stability margin, huh? Param. Increase. Stop it Stop the engine! Hey! But an engine like this should be able to withstand this easily, huh? Without a reasonable stability margin you are vulnerable to high risk failures, guys. Param, some more. Nambi. - You see my point? - Yes. Yes... yes, stop the engine. If that stand explodes, it will cost us a million pounds! It won't explode now. Another 0.2 bars and then the fireworks will begin! Engine is giving our expert belly dancer a complex about her hip-shake! Param, increase it. Stop! Stop the engine please. Param... Param... Param. 'Stop... stop' Michelle, I've done this before. The Ariane deserves a much more reliable engine. I know that you have placed orders for the mass production of the spare parts. But if I were you, I would think twice before putting my name on those contracts. But the rest is up to you. Hey! Come on, guys, let's go. Poor thing! That girl is even more shaken than the engine! I know you long enough to know that you are obviously doing this for a reason. But I don't know what it is. So I have to fall in the trap and ask you. Can you fix this? God's sake, Nambi. This is 'yes' And this is 'no' What does this mean? [French] Thank God! Someone finally asked. Yes... yes, I think I can do it. But I need all the information and data on the test failures to be able to do that [whispering] The one place where all the relevant information can be given to you is the RCD. Would you be able to make time for those meetings? Yes, I guess I can do that. But, Michelle, my schedule is very packed. Very busy. We'll work around your schedule. What happened, Param? I think what you can do is rotate all my men in all the departments. So that they can fill in for me when I am at the RCD. Easily done. The committee meets tomorrow at 9. But, Nambi, all I have is about 60 days to fix this. Can you do it? Yes, yes, yes! Yes, I can - I can try to fix it. - Thank you. I've heard of a mountain being dragged by a strand of hair. But you accomplished this Herculean task, Nambi. Okay, you managed to get inside RCD. How will you increase the stability margin of that damn Viking engine? Hail Professor Crocco! I swear! Devious wiz! You've already solved it, right? The problem is in the orifice. All we have to do is increase the diameter of the injector passage. And the stability margin will shoot up. Nambi, you are THE man. Thank you, but there is only one guy who can do this precise job. - Our man Unni? - That's right. We have to bring him here at the earliest and finish the job. Only then everything will be within our circle. Nambi, we are talking about ISRO. He will be here in a year or two, if we rush it! He has to come here within 15 days. We have no other option. We won't get a better opportunity to finish this mission victoriously. 'Sir, the ruckus you created to get me here' Like smearing the bull's butt with 'chunam' paste to make it run faster in a rekla race. ISRO created history driving me up the wall, sir. Given the chance. The Governor would have dropped me bag and baggage at the airport. So you understand how important your work here is, in France, Unni? - Yes, sir. - The whole mission depends on you. How's everyone at home, Unni? Fine, sir. My son wasn't keeping very well. - Aiyo! - But he's fine now I told my wife I'm going to France and she said. 'He who can't catch the rooster on the roof claims he's catching a glimpse of paradise' On my way back, she asked me to buy 1/2 kg onions, sir. So are you ready to take on the French, Unni? The lime paste has already been smeared on my butt, sir! Just watch me sprint! That's my man! 'Nambi, call for you on line #3' Hello? 'Unni...?' 'Can I talk to Unni?' 'I have been trying to reach him for a long time' Sorry, Unni is not here I am Nambi Na ray an an here. Can I take any message? Oh! Nambi sir... Nambi sir I am Unni's father-in-law speaking. 'I have been trying to reach him in this # for the past 2 days' 'The most tragic event has befallen us' 'Unni's 3 year old son' 'has passed away, sir' O' Mother Goddess! 'We are waiting for him' Please send Unni home as soon as possible, sir. His wife is heart broken and inconsolable. Nambi sir? 'Nambi sir?' Sir, I am at a loss for words I don't know what to do. 'I know this is the most unbearable tragedy for you' But there's a hitch, sir. It will take at least 15 days for Unni to reach Trivandrum. Why, sir? 'Sir, try to understand what I'm about to tell you' Even if I move heaven and earth to organize Unni's papers and tickets for him to fly will take minimum 4-5 days. By which time you would have finished all the rites. Instead if Unni stayed here for 8 days and completed his task. We will be able to complete a key project of our mission, sir. He is indispensable to us now. This will be a great service on his part to our motherland, sir. So I request you to allow. 'Whaat?!' 'Are you mad or what?' Didn't you hear a word of what I just told you? His one and only son is dead, sir. Sir... sir. You don't have to give me an answer right now. I understand your trauma, sir I'll call you in a short while. 'Consult your daughter and let me know your decision, sir' Thank you, sir. 'Sir, 1 minute' 'Before you tell me your decision I need to explain something to you' If Unni leaves now without completing his task. The blood, sweat and tears of 52 scientists for so many years. ISRO's investment and resources will go down the drain. And take many more years to retrieve our position. 'Sir, wait' 'Don't push me into a moral dilemma' 'I cannot dream of asking my daughter to do this' To the best of my ability I will try and... take good care of her. 'You do what you think is best, sir' Thank you very much, Nambi sir. You never let me pay for any of the gifts I buy for my family or my son. I feel a bit guilty, sir. Don't worry about all that. All you have to do is finish your job. Sure, sir. Excellent! Unni, you've got a call from home. Someone from your house wants to talk to you. Can't you hear me? You've got a call from India. GET IT INTO YOUR HEAD EMERGENCY CALL FOR YOU COME Nambi. When? Unni. Unni. Unni. You knew about this 15 days earlier. But you didn't tell me. You saw me buy clothes and toys for my son. You came shopping with me and you even paid for it! Then. How is it even possible for a man to be this inhuman? I did everything knowing fully well what I was doing. I had no choice, Unni. Even if you had gone back home early you couldn't have changed anything. But everything here would have got ruined. You succeeding in this mission unfortunately became my cruel duty. I'm ready to apologize to you. But I know very well you will not forgive me. No one should be in my shoes, Unni. 'But if it did again to me I will do exactly what I did now' What happened? Unni's son died and Nambi didn't tell him. Are you done? Got everything off your chest? This is not to reconcil. I do not want to see your face ever again in my life. Unni... Unni! - Nambi, why ddi you do this? - Did I ask you for advice? And even if I ask you don't give it to me. I am not here to get a character certification from you. Or win a popularity contest. We are here on a mission. It's to our credit if we complete it properly. And if any of you have a problem you can go back home today I can finish this mission without any of you. Go now. Get to work. We don't have time. There isn't much of a difference between your lie and the truth you hid. You lied. You hid the truth. But you did it purely for the welfare of our nation and development of ISRO I can understand that. But despite all these sacrifices. The first liquid engine that India made took a very long time, right? Nearly 8 years. Though we went to France and got a detailed training with their scientists. As usual we didn't have the funds to build our own liquid engine. Finally they sanctioned Rs 1 crore to build 1 engine. I built the engine in 60 lakhs. 'But the test stand required to test my engine cost nearly 100 crores' '1 billion!' 'So we had no choice but to go to France and test my engines on their test stand' 'Without external help we wanted ISRO to finally launch its own satellites' 'We knew how important the success of this engine hinged on it' 'So we were all extremely tense' - Param, the pressure system's good? - Good to go. All the best, Nambi. Thanks, Michelle. [French] I have a feeling this will crash and burn in less than 45 seconds. Of course it will but the question is, which second? - Want to bet? - Yes 42 seconds. I hope everything goes well today. At least our engine should fire. Even though Viking runs for 135 seconds I'll be happy with at least 90. Lord, allow it to run for 135 seconds I'll ensure the 135 scientists in ISRO will climb up Tirupati and tonsure their heads. Just 135 seconds I'll make 135 kg of 'laddu' with pure Indian ghee. 'Out station, this is Control' 'Weather condition okay' 'Clear to fire' Roger, copy that. 'Ten' 'Nine' 'Eight' 'Seven' 'Six' 'Five' 'Four' 'Three' 'Two' 'One' [praying fervently] 106-107-108 Hundred and 130-131-132 133-134 Thank you Thank you so much. You should congratulate Nambi It's his birthday as well. Thank you Congratulations. My God! My God! What have you done, Nambi? I'm so proud and happy for you! Thank you. For all those back home who thought we are here for the wine and women. This is a tight slap on all their faces. You have proven them wrong Nambi Na ray an an can be trusted to deliver. You are the man! VIKAS! It is a strange name for an engine. So is Vikram A Sarabhai. Nambi, I have to fulfil my vow of tonsuring the heads of 135. Vik-A-S. Trust you to come up with such an apt name! [French] Thank you so much for your assistance. This would never have been possible without all of you. Thank you. Did he just rattle in French? He did indeed. Very fluent French, in fact! Vikas engine was a noteworthy turning point for ISRO. Even after 25 years. Vikas engine has not failed even once. ISRO's magnificent achievement. Launches and missions might have failed. But Vikas engine. Not once. Not even once has it failed till date. None of ISRO's significant missions will travel in space without our Vikas engine. This is a truth that cannot be concealed or contradicted by anyone. What an astounding achievement, sir. Thank you. But you don't do anything in half measures. Then your next aim. Cryogenic engines. Yes, despite the number of solid and liquid fuel engines we had. Without cryogenics stage in the satellite launch market we wouldn't have made a name for ourselves. At that time I was the head Chief of Cryogenic Unit. We didn't have the time to make a cryogenic engine. 'Deciding to import the technology from other countries, we issued tenders' And in this 'groom matching' quest all the expected countries applied. 'American and French offers weren't feasible for us' 'On the other hand' 'Russian economy was drowning' 'And on that drowning ship was an engine that I was very familiar with' The KVD-1 engines. [Russian] How the eff does he know about the engines? Were you aware that he knows? How would I know? Sir, how do you know about the KVD-1 engin. Hey! Easy. How do you know about KVD-1 engines? Oh! Please don't worry about that I also know. That you have 252 engines. All I am asking for is 4 engines and technology transfer. [Russian] What the hell! He knows that too. He probably knows the color of our inner wear too! Be careful dealing with him. Nambi. You are a dangerous man! This is extremely classified information. How did you get access to it? [Russian] 'If I tell you that, you will die' 'And I will die!' Listen, don't worry about it. That's all the Russian I know! Okay, let me be honest with you. Our country is in shambles right now. Our economy is in danger. At Glavskosmos we really need this deal. So here is what we do. Do not mention the names in the contract Just say that you need an engine with. With a specific impulse of 461! Yeah... that. And I will do my best. I'm sure you will. - Sir, may I come in? - Yes, Nambi. Have you started training your replacements? I'll start in a couple of days, sir. Did you go through the Russian contract? Hmmm, I went through it. Are we making a mistake again? 14 years ago we could have bought this technology from France. For 10 million. But then too, in the favor of being too premature we let the deal go. And today France is asking us 10 billion for the exact same technology I rest my case! Okay. The Russian quotation is exactly 1⁄4th that of the others. First class technology. But. On account of being the cheapest they will be disqualified I know, sir. But I think I have a solution. Just leave it to me. Thank you. [Russian] Why are the Indians being so generous? What do you mean? For a meagre extra hardware they are paying much more than its worth. - Should we be worried? - Nothing to worry. Too desperate to broker this deal we didn't realize the value of what we had. But Nambi did and he's just being fair. That is why we love the Indians. There's no balance in this world. Why? Don't rub it in. She's coming. Be brave and speak with your mouth open. Understood? - Mr Nambi. - Hi. So what are you thinking about so deeply? I was just thinking how my wife would love a saree in the color of your dress. This is her favorite color. I'm sure she misses you very much I'm sure she does. Thank you. Ma'am, I would like you to meet another brilliant rocket scientist from ISRO. Mr Param. Nice to meet you, Mr Param [incoherent muttering] Goodbye. Goodnight. Sir, only you understood your 'pleased to meet you' There's no balance in this world! Sir, we should stop sniffing around here We'll find you a bride closer to home. Impossible. Sir, everything is possible. Impossible! How does he land up wherever we are? 'Mr Barry' Gentlemen. Nambi. What are you guys doing here? You know usual Govt work. But seriously. Am I following you or you following me? It is definitely me who is trying to follow you and that's not easy! - You are an exceptional man, Nambi. - Thank you. You know what? I want to show you something. Come with me. I want to ask you something. You know the work done at NASA benefits the whole world. From artificial limbs to heart pumps. Road safety to improved tyres. Our contribution really hasn't made the world a safer place for humans. But I always wondered. Humanity would have been better served. If you worked in NASA. Instead of what you are doing now. No offense. But could you imagine? What all you could've accomplished with the absolute best resources. Completely at your disposal. So I'm curious. Why did you say 'no' to NASA's offer, Nambi? Yeah. Yeah, I know. There should be a photograph of you in the Oxford dictionary. Right next to the definition of the word 'Patriotism' So... uh. - What are you doing here in Moscow? - Me? Oh! You know. Usual Govt work. What happened? What is the emergency? I don't know if you are aware, but. USSR as a nation will cease to exist tomorrow. The Americans, who are as it is, pissed off. That you haven't awarded the contract to them. But given it to us instead are taking advantage of the prevailing situation. And claiming that Russia is in violation with MTCR. By selling the cryogenic engines to India. When did a cryogenic engine become a weapon of mass destruction? And that too with a 500 kg payload? When have Americans ever played fair? I suspect they have an eye on all 252 of them. And they are claiming that India is using the KVD-1s to develop the ICBM. And if we go ahead with this contract. They will impose heavy punitive sanctions on us. We are sorry, Nambi. This will stop us from competing in the satellite launch markets. And push us back by decades! We are so close. [Russian] I just got a call from Kremlin. We have to make this happen. We have to help the Indians. What do you mean? The Indians have always been good to us. And this man Nambi has been very kind and fair. We can't let him down. The Kremlin has ordered me to see if we can help him out. What do you suggest we do? Nambi, do you have an idea how we can work it out? Yes. We actually do. Technically, all 4 engines are ready for delivery. The deferred payments were for India's convenience. What if we expedite the payments? Will you be able to handle all 4 engines in one go? That's great idea, Nambi. I can get the team here to comply. This will be a win-win. You guys win. I get screwed. Do you really think I am that stupid? Okay, look. I can pick up the engines wherever in Russia. And deliver them anywhere in Russia. But I can't take them out of the country. What do you say, Mr Nambi? Can you handle shipping? Professor Rao, there's no way Ural airlines will do it for less than 90 lakh rupees. Nambi, is there no limit to your demands? I just got the payment for the engines released in full. Now you want another 90 lakhs for Ural airlines? Where will I go for the money? How many times do you want me to go to the PMO? 'Sir, I'm not asking 90 lakhs for myself' Ask our Grand National airlines. Why didn't they live up to their promise? We wouldn't be in this dilemma now, right? 'Now we have no choice but to go with Ural airlines' Sir, at this moment, our need is more than theirs. Because if the Russians don't give us the cryogenic engines. The Americans certainly won't oblige. 'The French will take advantage of our plight' 'And sell it to us at 5 times the cost' That will be the end of India's cryogenic dreams forever. Okay, give me some time, sir. - Phone from PM's office. - 'Americans are not making our lives easy' Nambi, 1 minute. Yes, sir. 'The fund has been sanctioned' Okay, sir. 'Congratulations, Nambi Your fund has been approved' 'Now go, get us those bloody engines' Thank you so very much, sir I'll definitely bring. Thanks, Kalam. - 'May I speak to Nambi?' - I'll patch you on to Nambi. 'Sir, patching your call' - 'Kalam' - Nambi? As far as solid fuels are concerned, my work is over. Now it is time for you to take us to the stars. Kalam I don't believe doing anything in small measures. How are things at the DRDO? Going smooth, all well. But I miss the fun we had working together. Anyway all the best. Bye, Kalam. Thank God! That's all taken care of. So we are all set. Can you promise the engines will be delivered on time? I cannot promise that we will even be alive 2 hours later! That's the state our country is in. The only thing I can promise is that I'll try my best. Since I'm the one flying you out you can pay me once the job is done. We will fly from Krasnoyarsk to avoid attracting any attention Americans are definitely going to keep an eye out for us. The Americans will be looking out for flights leaving for India. What are your suggestions? I think we should fly to Karachi. Re-fuel and then fly to Trivandrum Karachi? The Americans would never imagine we would take rocket parts to our hostile enemy nation. And the Pakistanis would never search a Russian aircraft. Brilliant strategy! That's a great idea. While we are at it let's get the engines drunk. Drunk? What do you mean? Dismantle them. Hide them in the vodka crates. Another good idea! The Americans know. They are on their way here. We have to leave. What do you mean 'leave'? 2nd consignment is just taking off I need the nozzle assembly kit of all the four engines. As well as some parts of the 4th engine I'm not leaving without that. [Russian] Give me the damn radio! Nambi, you and your colleagues have to leave now. Or your lives will be in danger. Official orders from your chairman ISRO. [Russian] Sven, hold the take off. What about the rest of my parts? Rest of the 3rd consignment? There's no TIME! Think about your families. Wow, sir! Only in cinemas we are heroes, sir. What an inspiring life! Holding the engine in one hand and your life in the other. You've made the impossible possible. What an adventure! This sounds... James Bond like a spy thriller to me. - Thank you. - The next 3 years. Even after the retirement of U R Rao who supported you. You did not stop with your efforts to reach your goal. With no manuals or guidance. You were assembling the cryogenic engines. But before your cryogenics dream could come true. Your dream turned into a curse. 'Am I right?' 'There is free-for-all chaos that has started in Kerala' 'The case has been handed over to us' 'Look into the preliminaries' Right away, sir. 'Give me one more day I'll make him cough up everything' 'Are you out of your mind?' 'Entire media is in front of the police station from this morning' Shift him to Latex guest house immediately. Okay, sir. Move aside. 'Sir... sir' Move... make way. Hello, sir. How are you? I'm fine, who are you? Why have you arrested me? Which department are you? We'll tell you, sir. Hey! Get a cup of tea for sir. How did a man of your stature stoop to this level, sir? This case is absolute nonsense I have been ordered to interrogate you. But just as a formality we have a few questions to ask. All that's fine, sir. But why did they arrest me like a common criminal, sir? That too outside a temple? Somebody pushed me Pinned my neck down with his knee. This is not the way, sir I'm an ISRO scientist. - Sorry, sir. - This is not acceptable I apologize on their behalf, sir. It's just that, some of these officers just don't know how to behave. You aren't hurt, right? No. Please ask me whatever question you want I have to go back home My family is waiting for me. Thank you. Sir, who is this Mariam Rasheeda? - Mariam, who? - Rasheeda Mariam Rasheeda? I don't know Was she working in ISRO? Let him go. What do you think you are doing, man? Brainless or what? Is this how you behave with a scientist? CONTROL YOURSELF! I'm sorry, sir. Are you okay? Sir, I wish to apologize on his behalf. He's always like this. Sir, the thing is, we need information about this woman Mariam. And why you sold rocket technology to Pakistan? - This is all we want. - Sir, I don't know. And if we don't get this information. We'll bury you alive in this guest house. We are shedding our blood and sweat to protect our nation. 'And you think you can sell our nation for a few quick bucks? Bloody traitor! Now that you've had a good bath. - Let's start our prayers. - Wait. Look here. Let's not waste each other's time. Come to the point. You met that Maldivian woman and you slept with her. You got caught in a honey trap. And to get out of it you sold our country's secrets. This is the sequence of events. You had better confess and we'll go easy on you. So while you are at it, why don't you make me to confess about the Bofors case? And the share market scandal also? He's funny, eh? Good sense of humor I think we should show him our sense of humor. O' Mother Goddess! [Malayalam] 'This case' is getting serious' 'Big heads will roll We should be careful' Traitors don't deserve to sit! Fine. I won't sit. But you are wrong. Because I was never in Madras on the 24th of January. WHERE THE HELL WERE YOU?! That is none of your business! Who do you think I am, huh? You think I don't know this telephone is a recorder? You assumed I would repeat everything you say. And you would record it and use it as my confession? What do you take me for... a fool? I am a Rocket Scientist! Scientist? You will know as time goes by what you should and shouldn't say. We are just getting started. Where were you on the 24th of January? 'I met N... Nrambi Na ray an' 'In a hotel room' 'Forget about a confession' 'This man won't be alive until tomorrow at the rate you are going!' BP is low. Heart rate is off the chart. 'We have to revive him immediately' Get up. Sir, this is Nambi Na ray an an I came to hand over this case to you. Hello, Mr Na ray an an I am P M Nair from the CBI. Thank you for telling me your name and department. The three others before you didn't tell me anything. Like some tea? 'Please sit down' Go pal, sit down Drink tea before you go. - No, it's okay. - Please sit down. Have a cup of tea with us. How are you doing? - Sir... - Yeah, please come. Sit... sit here. Rajashekar, please sit here. Fauziya, please sit Mariam. Sir, I just came to hand over the case, I am leaving. - Sit down, Go pal, please. - No, it's okay, sir. Go pal, sit down. Mariam. Do you recognize this man? Yes, sir. He's the bastard who threatened to put ice on my private parts, sir. Sir, she's lying. - Damn you! I'll break your bones. - Quiet... quiet! Will you stop talking to her in Malayalam? She only understands English. Are you saying you do NOT recognize her? 'No, sir, somebody else put her in this situation' Sir, he said he would rape me in front of my daughter. 'If I don't do as he said' - How dare you! - Quiet, Go pal. - You know whom you're talking to? - Go pal, sit down. QUIET, GOPAL! Sit down. Mariam? You know him? Yes. 'Where have you met him?' Actually I have never met him, sir. I just heard his name once. My arrest was done and the inspector showed his pictures to us. And we were... trained to say his name. Nam... Nambi... Nambi Nara. Is that what you were doing? Reading off a board during the confession? Yes, they were holding it for us to read I'm sorry, sir I have to go. GOPAL! I need to speak to Mr Na ray an an alone. We were beaten and tortured to say your name in this case. We had no option. We are very sorry. Sorry. Have some tea please. Not to worry. Relax, drink your tea [saucer clattering] 3rd degree? What do you think? If they hadn't called a doctor in the middle of the night to revive me I wouldn't be sitting here in front of you CBI is already on to the case. They had no business questioning you. Questioning me? They weren't here to question me. They wanted to beat a confession out of me for a crime I didn't commit. What confession? That I sold rocketry secrets to Pakistan for 9. I'm not recording you. If I need to record you I'll let you know. That in return for sleeping with one of these women. I sold my nation's rocketry secrets to Pakistan it seems. And they paid me $9 lakhs for it. And this deal happened in Hotel International in Chennai. On the 24th of January it seems. And...? And all of this is a lie. How can I sell technology to Pakistan that our country does not possess? And the designs I allegedly sold to Pakistan are available. In any book store anywhere in the world for a mere sum of Rs 200. You can't build a rocket engine with all those so called facts. Sir, this is Rocket Science 52 scientists worked in close collaboration with French scientists for 3 years. And it still took us 16 years to build our own rocket engines. And. Today is the first time I have met these 2 ladies. And. They have their facts completely wrong. On the 23rd of January I was attending my friend's funeral. And on January 25th, it was my granddaughter's first birthday. On 24th, the day in question I was not in Madras. I was in Trivandrum in ISRO. If you want, you can check the vehicle log books. I'll try and get to the bottom of this as soon as possible. Meanwhile for your safety I need to move you to judicial custody. I just have one last question. As innocent as you say you are. Why has no one from ISRO come to your aid? Nobody has even come and seen you so far in jail. Why? I don't know, sir. Maybe scientists are strange people! They know exactly how to react when a rocket fails. Maybe they don't know how to react when a man collapses! Hey! A visitor is here to see you. Wow! What timing! If someone had asked me who would have been my 1st visitor in jail. I would have never guessed it would've been you in a 1000 years. How are you doing, Mr Unni? Congratulations, Mr Unni. The state you were yearning to see me in. I am standing right in front of you fulfilling your wish! Beaten, disheveled and in soiled clothes. Broken spirit. Family humiliated. Career in shambles. Look, I've peed in my pant. No bladder control. And on top of it all. Branded as a traitor. But you know what? What you went through because of me. You are justified in seeing me in this state, rightfully so. And for Mr Unni. I am willing to stand here for as long as you want. Feast your eyes. How I would extract revenge for what you did to me is something I have thought of every single day in my life. Because you lack basic human kindness. Temerity from head to toe. A mean, law unto yourself, selfish son of a bitch. 'Monster even' But even then, in my worst dreams I couldn't have imagined seeing you like this. But whatever you are, Mr Nambi Na ray an an. From my unfortunate personal experience. I know. You just cannot betray our nation. It is a shame beyond words no one visited you in jail so far. Now that I am here. Tell me what needs to be done to get you out of here. Because in this room. If you think you are the only patriot here. You are making a mistake once more. 'Sir, please do something' They are beating appa in jail and asking him unrelated questions. Sir, why. Sir, they are trying to coerce sensitive information from him. 'Who is head of cryogenics research?' 'Who sanctions TOT deals?' I don't know why they need to know all this. I don't know how much more Nambi sir can take, sir. Does anybody in ISRO know what to do? - When can we meet appa? - Sir, please do something. When can we go and meet appa? We can go anytime. Take a few clothes and some home cooked food, okay? I've packed food for him I'll just get his clothes. Sister, can you make a cup of tea for me? Whatever happens we cannot take her to jail [door bell rings] 'I seriously don't know where to begin, sir' The sheer audacity and the absurdity of filing such a case on him shocks me. It's mind boggling, sir I'll show you. Apart from Nambi Na ray an an there are 5 others in this case, sir. 'Rajashekaran, a Glavskosmos agent' 'He was working with the Russians' Surendran. 'Expert metallurgist with Cryogenics department at ISRO' Fauzya Hassan Maldivian citizen. 'She came to India to admit her daughter in school' 'Along with her friend Mariam Rasheeda' Mariam Rasheeda '35 year old Maldivian citizen' 'She sparked the entire chaos' 'And the common link between Surendran, Rajashekaran and I D Go pal' 'And finally I D Go pal' 'Kerala police' 'Responsible for the initial arrests' 'Likely due to a personal grudge against these women' 'It is true these women met I D Go pal, Surendran and Rajashekaran' 'Some favors were offered' 'Some taken' 'Some denied' A small regional newspaper published one of these indiscretions. Media blew it up into a circus and the frenzies followed. 'Kerala Police is setting right the authority within their department' 'Using this case to their advantage' Like bursting crackers on a non-Deepavali day. Intelligence Bureau Department totally unconnected poked its nose too. Their agenda seems dubious. 'And finally Kerala political parties' Jumped into the arena to settle their long standing feud. End result is. 'In effect, a hastily concocted despicable case with inexplicable motives' And what is more baffling is as far as espionage, spying. And transfer of rocket technology to Pakistan is concerned. Forget Nambi, sir. There is not even an iota of proof to implicate any of the others in this case. 'These are the facts I have established in my investigation' 'Mariam Rasheeda had never met Nambi Na ray an an before' They met for the first time in my presence in custody. 'We were beaten and tortured to say your name in this case' As reported by IB on January 24th. Forget Hotel International. Nambi Na ray an an was not even in Chennai. He was in Trivandrum on that day in ISRO. 'If you want you can check the vehicle log books' 'All of them were tortured and confessions were coerced' Except for Nambi who withstood all the torture meted to him. And till the end confessed nothing. 'I visited Nambi's house to inquire, sir' 'Which by the way, IB and the Kerala police have not bothered to do till date' 'This isn't the lifestyle of a man who was offered 9 lakh US dollars' So everybody else is lying? And your father didn't commit any crime. Do you believe he is innocent? Sir, kindly step out I need to talk to you. Please come. Come, sir 2 minutes. Leave right now, sir. Where have you come and whom are you maligning? What gall to deride my husband to ME! I want you to leave, sir. It's a very self-respecting family, sir. I am suspicious of the time frame this case has been foisted on Nambi. 'Because here are two things that have come to light from my visit to ISRO, sir' One 45 days back, India launched her first remote sensing satellite. And stupefied the world. Therefore in the multi-billion dollar satellite launch market India proved she is a powerful contender. Two. Only recently India imported from Russia cryogenic technology and engines. Thereby enabling ISRO in comparison to other agencies to launch satellites at a much lower price. America tried its best to stop this deal, come what may. What seems highly suspicious 3 men who were arrested were working in the cryogenic department. Is this simply a coincidence? Or our bigger concern is. To get ISRO completely out of the commercial satellite market. And stop ISRO from competing at any cost. Was it a diabolical well-planned conspiracy? What is more cause for anxiety, Nair. If Nambi Na ray an an, the man touted to be the next director of ISRO is as innocent as you claim. Then who dragged his name into this case? 'Who is trying to destroy Nambi Na ray an an?' This incident forced you to be imprisoned for 50 days. And the Maldivian women lost 2 years of their lives in jail. Top officer of Kerala police was suspended. The Deputy Director of IB who was in charge of this case. Retiring prematurely. And settled down with his family in USA. And Chief Minister of Kerala was dismissed from his seat of power. Many questions still remain unanswered. But the only silver lining of solace is. After numerous appearances in court. Enduring the torture and 50 days in jail. You were finally granted bail. And you got your freedom. Is that 'solace'? Please. Just wait here Please understand. Please. Pa. Appa! Where is Meena? Where is she? Huh? Meena. She couldn't handle the brutal way people treated her, appa. HUH? Meena? MEENA Meena. Hey! Meena. What is the matter, dear? Meena...? Hey! I'm back. Look at me I'm back home, dear. Aiyo! 'Shankar Geetha...?' Meena rushed out that way. Alright, pa. I'm fine, go check on her. "Who poisoned my milky white life with such venomous spite and strife?" "Who dispersed my dreams so lofty that touched the skies high & mighty?" [Malayalam] We need to take her to a senior psychologist. She is in a state of deep shock like she has seen a ghost. Sir, I don't think your wife believes you are actually back. Don't worry She will recover soon. "My heart yearns to beat no more at this torturous twist to settle a score" "Won't this be a nightmare that will vanish into thin air?" "Can't tomorrow bless and bring a dawn with a new beginning?" "Like a meteorite drilling a deep crater" "My life has fallen into depths of despair" "This pain is a torment unimaginable" "My breath feels choked; Indefinable" "In this mirage that made no sense I searched for my life's essence" "I spent every minute of the day like a walking corpse wasting away" "Will this darkness dissolve for clear skies to (r)evolve?" "Will my life be a dead end always sullied and stained?" "Will my life once again bloom dispelling this grief and gloom?" "Can't this be a dream best forgotten that will fade into oblivion?" "Can't tomorrow envelop a dawn of fresh hope?" "Like a meteorite drilling a deep crater" "My life has fallen into depths of despair" "This pain is a torment unimaginable" "My breath feels choked; Indefinable" 'Although Nambi Na ray an an is out on bail' 'It is unlikely he will be reinstated in ISRO' 'As per the new case Kerala police has filed' Narasimhan. Let's talk outside. Nambi, don't be silly. 'They can't manufacture an evidence and put you in jail' Narasimhan, if I do go back to jail I don't want my family to be left in the lurch. As it is, they are going through hell. It has to be written someday. "Won't this be a nightmare that will vanish into thin air?" "Can't tomorrow bless and bring a dawn with a new beginning?" "Like a meteorite drilling a deep crater" "My life has fallen into depths of despair" "This pain is a torment unimaginable" "My breath feels choked; Indefinable" 'Appa' I know for the past 6 months you've been through hell. And we cannot even begin to imagine all that you've faced. Do exactly what you want. Nobody can stop you and we'll totally understand. But let me share two points. One, the need to prove your innocence to the world. And the frenzy is embedded only in you. And secondly. God forbid, if something happens to you. This family will always be known as traitors to the nation forever. And I don't think as a family we'll be able to live with that either. By the way. Here's the will you asked your lawyer to draft. Appa. Are we not better than this? A run an. Let's call the cryogenic department. I want to know what the progress is. 'I want regular updates' 'If I get a chance to work on this project again' 'I want to be completely prepared' Why is it so empty? After Rajashekaran, Surendran and you were arrested, there was panic in the ranks. They opted for a transfer to other departments. Few of them left Trivandrum to join ISRO in other cities. How many are left? A fraction! How strange! Why does it look like nobody has been here for months, huh? What are you looking for? Where are the nozzle assembly kit and the other engines? - Nambi, they were never delivered. - What?! 'You were the single point contact for this project' Without you, the foundation collapsed! Forget the 3rd consignment. Parts of the 2nd consignment have still not been unloaded. 'I am the one who told A run an not to tell you anything' India was once the greatest nation in the world for science and technology! Who would believe it? Look at us now. Like a blind man riding a horse! Yes. Someone rightly said India never lost to her invaders. We sacrificed ourselves with our own swords. And handed our nation over to them on a platter. Begging and beseeching other nations for technology and parts seems to be our fate. Every time we risk our lives and strive we end up cutting our noses! But, Param, other nations engage our brilliant minds and overtake us. Listen. Why blame those who left? Instead of focusing our intelligence on research and earning name & fame who in his right mind will want to be indulging in street fights like us? Even if our scientists are being used. Still other nations do everything internally, it is domestic. Totally indigenous. And that's exactly what we need to do too. First we make our Vikas engine completely indigenous. And then doesn't matter what it takes. We make our cryogenic engine completely indigenous. Perfect! That will only take us another 20 years! - Is that okay? - So be it, so what? At least things will be at our own pace after that. More importantly, we will have all the control. I'm afraid we don't have any other choice, Mr Unni. What if I tell you, we can make the world turn speechless in amazement? That I have the mother of all indigenous ideas. Will you believe me? What? The Mars Mission. What if I tell you that if we focus on indigenous production. We can achieve this mission at a fraction of what other agencies have spent on it. Are you prepared to believe me? Mr Genius. We just concluded we won't have cryogenic engines for the next 20 years! You were here, right? What if I tell you, to succeed in Mars Mission. We do NOT need a cryogenic engine will you believe me? We can just do it with solid and liquid engines. I firmly believe so. It is 100% possible. Not telling us this earlier, what if I tell you I want to launch a rocket up your ass, will you believe me?! 5-4-3 You know how ridiculous and eccentric you sound, right? Is that so? Uncle, being the 'king of eccentricity' how can this be new to you? While ISRO was still floundering with solids when you wanted to pursue liquids it was eccentric to say the least. Asking for £400 million worth of equipment for free in Scotland? Bizarre! Carting our scientists to France. And ending up building a better engine than the French themselves? Smuggling the cryogenic engine from Russia from under the nose of Americans? Uncle, if anybody should understand the power of being eccentric who else but you? So why stop now? Okay. What do you have in mind? So what if we don't have the cryogenic engine? Our Vikas engine runs for 180 seconds. So if the Vikas engine can be increased to enhance thrust, that will do. I swear, trust me. We can launch a satellite around Mars. That too, as indigenous as it can get! With our Indian Almanac! Bravo! Are you serious? 'Amme Bhagavati' This is unbelievable! And of course the rest is history! A run an became the Project Head of Mars Mission. With the modified Vikas engine and the science behind the Indian Almanac. We accomplished the near impossible in the very first attempt. What an achievement, sir. But during that period you were under severe duress. On one side you had to save your job you regarded as your heartbeat. And the other, a fight to prove your innocence. You were fighting this single handed 4 years, 75 court hearings, 3 lawyers, 5 petitions. And the millions spent. It would have taken a huge toll on you and your family for sure. Am I right? Please come... welcome. I'm so happy to see all of you. Such a pleasant surprise, I didn't expect to see the entire family. The bride's family is boasting of being a family of doctors. But are we less by any standard? We have rocket scientists in our family, huh? We'll be there. Madam. Too soon, I think we rushed it We shouldn't have come here. 'Hey Mariam!' Where are you?! [mobile ringing] Hello? One sec. Mama, it's for you. Appa. Who is it? Who? Hello, Nambi Na ray an an. Yes. Thanks. What happened? What is it? It's over. The case. It's over [many other mobiles ringing] The Supreme Court has declared that I'm completely innocent. Meena... Mee. Hold this. Ma'am. Meena, you don't have to cry anymore. This is your victory. You are the only one eligible to revel in this moment fully, dear. I was waiting for the verdict I've finally earned the right now to tell you how sorry I am. Forgive me. I wasn't a good husband. How sorry I am I wasn't a good father. How sorry I am I always put my work before you and the family. Look at me. You always believed in me unconditionally. No matter what, you defended me. You stood beside me I don't know how to thank you, Meena? Meena, forgive me, dear. Please forgive me. No... no... no, let me speak today. Please listen to me. Listen I don't know if being a good husband from now on will set right the past. No matter what happens I will always be beside you I want to live for you. Only for you. Meena, you've done enough. Now it's time for you to be the queen. And let me serve you for the rest of my life. Let's go, dear I want to go home. Call for the car. Is Meena okay? Murali, I'm so sorry. Don't apologize. We are so blessed you got this wonderful news in my son's wedding. Please take care of your family. Alright. Let's go. I take leave. So. Supreme court cleared your name and pronounced your innocence. If it is decided to pelt a dog and kill it all that is required is to label it a rabid dog! In the same way the intention was to prevent you from holding your head high. Defaming you as a traitor will do the trick. That's the reward you got! The despair and distress brought about by this case. Even 24 years later your wife is still traumatized. And hasn't recovered. You have paid a heavy price for it. You sued for a sum of 10 million as compensation. But more than a decade later. You have been granted only 1 million! Is this compensation of any value to you? Do you think so? What do you mean? I may be too old, weak and senile to spend or enjoy all that money, Mr Suriya. But I want every single paisa of that compensation. Because unless I get that money. The sword of suspicion hanging as 'traitor' over my family won't vanish. And after sacrificing all this, I will not allow that infamy. I am not fighting this only for myself. How many people like me in this nation? How many, Mr Suriya? Those punished for being a patriot. I must fight for their cause. I will fight till my last breath. I will fight. To offer words of solace. I'm totally at a loss. Not as an actor or hero. As an ordinary citizen. As a human being. I want to do this for you. To do this on behalf of our entire nation. I don't know if I have the right or eligibility. But I can't be without doing this. Nambi, sir. On behalf of our people. I ask forgiveness. For the way we treated you. For all the due honors we did not shower on you. I ask forgiveness for everything. Please forgive us. Sir, I understand your good intentions. And I am grateful for it. But please don't make this grand apology. If you offer an apology ever so magnanimously. And I accept it. It will create a false sense of closure. But it doesn't fix or change anything I can't come to terms with that and so I cannot accept your apology. Mr Suriya. If I am innocent. Then isn't somebody else guilty? The question is 'who'? A befitting answer has to be found for this question of mine. If those who have dedicated their lives for their nation's progress are not respected or cherished. No such nation has become a superpower in our annals of history. At the same time. May be a few would have tried to destroy me with that spy case. But there were many, many more. Without an ounce of fear who stood by my side and fought to establish by innocence. That's why like I said in the beginning I have complete faith in the goodness of my people. And the integrity of my nation. Anyway. For your goodness of heart. Thank you very much. Jai Hind!
