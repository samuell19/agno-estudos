One, two... -Another round, please! -We missed this one! Smile please. Very good. Very good. Kaajal. Dolly? Where are you? -Dolly! -Kaajal! -I found you! -Where? Here! Pappu, hurry up! Give that to me. If you're too naughty, Mom will run away! Come on. Amit, go pay! Your sister Dolly is such a spendthrift! You don't look like Empress Mumtaz! And you never will. Bharat, it's just a costume. Leave him alone. Come on. Kaajal, join us. -Come on, Aunt. -Come. We need the princess in the picture. Ready? One, two, three. Kaajal! I'm so glad you've come to live with us in Noida. Now whatever happens, I am there for you. There is something, Dolly. -Shall I tell you? -Yeah. Your husband-- Amit keeps hovering around me... trying to touch me. Kaajal, he's your brother-in-law. He cares about you. He wants to have sex with me. -Did you hear me? -What? Your husband wants to have sex with me! What? Have you lost your mind? Your hormones are raging. Perhaps, you're attracted to him. Maybe you want to sleep with him. -What? -It's natural. You're young. That's why you're confused. But try not to be confused. Or you won't survive in this city. Look! Bubbles! -Started? -Whoa! Come on. Let's get in fast. Our house is up in the sky! You'll be able to see right up to Delhi. Please, come. Papa, I can't see the cricket ground. You can see everything from the roof. Look, it's almost ready. There will be a door here. And see... -the windows are almost done. -Oh, they are! Here's the balcony. The air's so fresh! So, yes. You can't delay your installment, Mr. Yadav. It's been a year... the building is far from ready. The delay is costing me. Don't worry. It'll be ready soon. I love this fancy tap! It's the best quality! Delays do happen, right? -They do. -Is this tap going to cost me extra? Not at all, Mr. Yadav. Don't worry, Mr. Suresh. We'll pay the rest this month. Sure, take your time. But hurry up. I'll take a loan. There's a queue. Who comes house-hunting early in the morning? Sorry. Bloody witch! Sorry. -Is my room confirmed? -Bed -Bedroom? -Not room, only bed. Thank God, at least I'll have my own bed. Pay an advance for two months, or nothing's confirmed. Stop daydreaming. Taj Mahal! Light. -Thank you. -We missed you a lot, Mrs. Yadav. Yes, but I don't like it. I've seen the Taj Mahal so many times. It's boring. We also visit often. Taste these sweets. From Agra's famous shop, Panchi Petha. Panchi Petha. How was your weekend, Mrs. Yadav? It was fantastic. I went to the amusement park with my family. -Really? -Yes. It was fun. -Mrs. Yadav. -Yes? -Tea. -Oh, yes. Mr. Pandey. I need a loan. A small one. You work for fun, right? Why do you need a loan? Just wanted a new car. Mrs. Yadav, you know we don't give loans. Tea? Sir, I need an advance. I need to pay for a bed space. Get back to your work. Forget about the advance. You've to pay for every defective piece. Sorry, sir. It was a mistake. Won't happen again, sir. Please don't cut my salary. I need the money. Be grateful... you're working in a factory, not milking cows. -Mr. Gippi! -What? I am a factory worker, not your slave. The food is still not here! We're having guests over. -Mom! -I can't take Pappu along. Mom! I can't take Pappu along. -I'm not going with him. -What happened? Oh, no! Go bring the antiseptic. Mrs. Yadav? Your order from Ippy. -Two hours late! I'm so mad! -I'm sorry. It won't happen again. I'm never ordering from Ippy again. -What's your name? -Osman Ansari. I'm going to complain against you. Get the food. The guests will be arriving in an hour. -Keep it here. -Sorry, madam. It's leaking. Please don't complain against me. I'm a student. I need this job. Delivery boys can't afford to be late. Let me help you. Bring the food inside. The table's getting dirty. Yes. In my new house, I'll hire a cook. Here. We'll also get an AC there. There's no space here. Mom, you've ordered food? Bharat, go take a shower and do your homework. Where's the cut? It'll be fine. Will you play with my new dolls? Sure. No... You're done, right? Thank you. Sorry, I was late, ma'am. When you rate me, please give me five stars. You're rather confident! -Did you want water? -No, ma'am. Keep ordering from Ippy. And... five stars... Where are your emerald earrings? Safe in the bank. Don't these look good? Where did you get them? Don't worry. They're fake. Listen... Did your office approve the loan? They will. Lovely. I'll go make a drink. We'll get an AC in our new house. There's no power backup here. When are you moving? Luxurious buildings take time. It already has running water, a modular kitchen, and fancy taps! -Wow. -Why don't you buy one? We already own a home. Paying for a new one is impossible. Our home was given to you as a dowry. Your father contributed. It's not a dowry. Dolly's father gifted us this furniture. Can't call it a dowry. Gift or dowry, it's the same. We women love to protest! Have some spring rolls, Mrs. Kumar. -Text me the recipe. -Sure-- But Mom ordered the food-- Bharat, go look after your friends. -But, Mom-- -Bharat, go inside. Meet Mr. & Mrs. Kumar. And Mr. & Mrs. Chatterjee. I work with them. And this is Kaajal. My cousin. Kaajal, what are you doing in Noida? She works at Pritam Shoes. In business development. Looks like you're giving your brother-in-law a hard time! I'm not well, I'm going in. -What happened? -Yes, get some rest. She could've stayed for a bit. -Sehwag aced it in the cricket match. -He was Man of the Match? Yes, he was. Stop pretending, Dolly. I've figured you out. Drink? It was bloody hard to get you that job. And you quit in a heartbeat. I'm confused, Dolly. That's why. So now? Cheers! Nancy is cuddling with you in bed. Are you having fun? Nancy loves only you. Brajesh, your skin is so soft. And my silky, golden, blond hair... is caressing your soft skin. -Touch me, Nancy. -Oh, Brajesh! Keep it, as a welcome gift. Just focus on your star ratings and gift sales. That's it. Hello. I'm stuck in traffic. Show me some love. What's taking you so long? Hello, this is Kitty. Your new companion... on the Red Rose Romance app. Kitty, say "I love you" and kiss me. Sorry, it's my first time, so-- Say, "I love you." Come on, Kitty. Say "I love you," dammit! I love you. Only night shifts, Mom. A car will pick me up and drop me off. The office is fully air-conditioned. It's freezing. It's way better than the factory! Totally high profile! Thirty thousand a month and free food. I'll send you some money right away. I'm planning to get my own place. No. Dolly and Amit take good care of me. But I don't want to be a burden on them. Yes, she's here. Hello, Aunt. Kaajal is everyone's darling. She's my sister. I don't want her to move out either. But she's stubborn. She called off her wedding and came to live with me. Okay, okay. Alright, Aunt. Give my regards to Uncle. Okay. -Here. -You've served her so little. Want her to starve to death? She'll help herself, she's not a kid. And why is Kaajal moving out? We're her family, she doesn't need to be alone. She needs a room of her own! Here, she's stuck with Bharat and Pappu. She'll be back if she doesn't like it there. Right, Kaajal? There's no salt in the eggs. Mr. Pandey. Can't we get an AC in the office? I agree with Mrs. Yadav. -It's very hot. -We can get an AC. But why suddenly...? Call centers offer amazing facilities. And you don't need a degree to work there! I don't care. And free food. Continental, Chinese... Also, air-conditioned cars to ferry them. Wow! You've made lovely tea. Mr. Pandey. There's an AC in the manager's office. -So why don't we-- -Do you have one in your bedroom? I've one in my bedroom, Mr. Pandey. The bed's gone. Someone paid an advance. I'll let you know once another bed is free. But I need a bed right now, ma'am. I have nowhere to go. Please, auntie! Stop here. She lost 500 thousand and her career. Poor Strawberry. So, do you plan to stay here? Hopefully, if I get a bed. Married? Surrogate? Or here for an operation? I just need a bed... that's it. To the left. Over there? Mind the curtain. Thanks. -Thanks for the help. -It's okay. I'll get going, Mrs. Yadav. -I guess you have college. -I can wait for the AC to be fixed. -Yeah, the AC... -Yeah... No... -No. -Have some. No. Please. Thank you. The cooling's strong, isn't it? The cooling's fantastic, isn't it? You waste a lot of money, Dolly. It's rented. And the doctor says... it's best to do it when it's cold. Really? Shall we try? Do you remember our first time? It was our honeymoon, in Mussoorie. I remember. You didn't have a beard. You look like a cleric. I think I look like a hot cricketer! Guess what? The loan got approved. -Why didn't you tell me? -Never got the chance. That's great news! Since we have the AC in our room... let's get the kids to sleep here. Just for tonight. Kitty, my pussy cat. You like cats? I love my cat. She's the one I see every day. Don't you meet people? Only when I have to. I guess you make good tea. I guess. I like it. Make a cup for me too. Kitty, make me happy. Happy? Bitch, say something romantic! Hey, mind your language. TALK ABOUT MOVIES Do you like films? I used to watch them with my wife. Sridevi used to be my favorite actress. Please don't stop talking. Mr. India? Have you seen Sridevi's film Mr. India? Kitty, please keep talking. What else do I say? How about... songs? Shall I sing you a song? Each breath bursts forth To share my heart Like a cloudburst My pulsating heart So, here goes... I... I love you Wow! You're a star. You handled that pervert beautifully. All the best for many more. Thank you, sir. Keep it up! Good job. Hello, this is Kitty... your new companion on the Red Rose Romance app. Some people work here just for the free food. Eat all you want. In the beginning, the variety is dazzling. The sweet and the spicy. And some people have better metabolism. Good joke. But body shaming is so last century! No, I didn't mean to-- Myself, Juhi. Hi. -I am-- -Kaajal. I know. You're new in Noida? Let's party sometime. -Mom, that's our bus. -That one? Okay. Get up. -Excuse me? -This is the girls' bus. Go to your bus. -Aren't both buses going to the museum? -What's going on? Ma'am, they are in the girls' bus. -The boys' bus is the other one. -Sorry, I... But we're in the right bus, ma'am. We're going to the doll museum. -The boys are going to the rail museum. -Why? Come on, Pappu. -No, I want to see the dolls. -We'll go see the trains. -No, I want to see the dolls! -Pappu! No, we'll see the trains! We'll miss the bus. Pappu... the bus will leave! So what? I want to go to the doll museum. What's happening? -That's enough! -Mom! -You're playing with dolls! -Mom! Mom! But, that's mine! Mom. "Genetic studies answer many questions. If the mother has bodily issues, it can affect the mind and body of her child." -What? -Don't look at me like that. I'm not saying it. The health magazine says so. And the father has no role to play? It's not mentioned here! Many diseases, one cure. I did what I did because I wanted to be happy. Nobody forced me. I couldn't do what mothers do because I desired to live my own life. I fulfilled my desire. I don't want forgiveness, just another chance. Yours, Mommy. Awesome! One night out! DJ Gujjar in the house! Hey, ladies and gentlemen. DJ Gujjar Number One! My Juliet! Our next question is... what was Sridevi's first Hindi film? I'm the Queen. Right answer! You win a holiday to Agra from Starry Travels! Drink it neat Enjoy the beat You're getting high And it's so sweet Like a butterfly You flutter with color Mad fun, isn't it? Greater Noida is the new Shanghai! -I've grammar homework. -Really? Still guarding your virginity? Said "I love you" yet? -People often say it to get sex. -But DJ has said it to you, right? DJ wears his heart on his sleeve! Shazia! I love you! I love you too, my DJ! I love you. Five thousand rupees, per piece. But last time, you gave me 35,000. The piece is hollow. If your husband finds out you're selling your jewelry, you'll be in trouble. Shut up, Pappu! If the mister doesn't know, keep selling! Who cares? Pack all of it. Madam? Osman. Can I drop you somewhere? -Your deliveries? -I'll manage. You always give me three and a half stars. Maybe now you'll give me five. Well... -Come on, Pappu. -That a boy! Need some help? No, thanks. Lots of traffic! -Sorry, are you comfortable? -I'm fine. Bye. Bharat's inside. I don't want to play. For you. It's my favorite. We've taken the wrong road? Depends on your perspective. The road's different, not wrong. Works for my delivery. Mrs. Yadav. -Yes. -Is the AC cooling well? I'm used to it. But sometimes, it's too cold. Sorry, madam, sorry. -Did you get hurt? -No. But... I'll go. -Let me drop you. -No, it's fine. Ma'am-- It's okay. But we're right there... Thank you.

How's your music thing going? -I've made a cracking new track. -When are we going to hear it? I'll give it to you. Feed your college buddies for free, Ippy boy! What's that? The bill, Billa. Please pay up. I've a lot of deliveries. Here. -Gulp it down. -I don't want it. Please... pay the bill. I've to do accounts -and my assignments-- -Working hard?

Hello, this is Kitty, your new companion on the Red Rose Romance app. Hi, Pradeep? -Have you had dinner? -What? What did you eat? Chinese. My office provides a variety of food, all for free. That's good. I won't have to worry about you every day. Or I'd feel bad eating dinner while my friend's hungry. You're quite caring. And daring too! You are daring. Or you wouldn't call me your friend. But you said you're my new companion. And you sound sweet. So I took a chance. But we've only been talking for a few minutes. So what? You can fall in love in just a few minutes. Don't you agree? You sound rather romantic. Are you getting bored? -Actually, I am-- -Actually, what? I'm having fun. It feels like I'm using the app... so you can flirt with me. Flirt and me? No way. I don't even know the "F" of flirting. -Oh, really? -Honestly, I don't. Do you know the "L" of flirting? "L"? I'll have to think. Tell me. "L" for Ludo. "L" as in, Ludo. "L" for... London. Oh, God. You're so... "L" as in London. What were you thinking? I thought, "L" as in Lucknow. Oh, Lucknow. Kitty baby's upset with me? Your combination of "caring" and "daring" is... ultrahazardous. "Ultrahazardous"? Who uses such words? Where are you from? Are you making fun of me? Never! Now, tell me... Asthua, Darbhanga District, Bihar. Kitty from Darbhanga. Tell me your real name. Kaa-- How does it matter? It's just a name. -Okay, tell me your age. -I'm over 21. And you? Just a few years older. We'll be good together, right? Do you like chocolates? I'm thinking of sending you some. Only if you like me... as a complimentary gift. A foreign one. And Fruit and Nut is my favorite. I'll think about it. Is anyone there? I need water. Alright, Kitty baby. Let's talk tomorrow. Good night, Pradeep. Please call me "baby." Good night, Pradeep. Please say "baby." Good night. Brilliant call, wasn't it? The chat was a bit too personal. But it was great! -Kaajal! -I'm busy, Dolly. How busy are you? It's easier to call the prime minister. Call you later. What happened? Nothing. Feels like a new era for women. Right? Definitely a new era for you. Bring it in. Yes, this way. Watch your step. Keep it here and plug it in. Carefully. Keep it on top. Excellent!

Comfortable? -Mr. Chaudhary. -Come, my sweetheart. -How are you? -Looking gorgeous as ever. Thank you. -Love you. -Love you, too. Ajay. Hello. Hello. -Hi. -How're you doing? The usual. Two whiskeys, please. DJ Pyari, in the house! How's the new building going? I'm selling all the flats in Star Heights. Superb plan! Sell the fucking building, forget about the construction! What? Want to increase your rate? How much? -Bathroom! -Bathroom? Wait, I'll join you. Greater Noida is a great city. Foreigners, hospital, colleges, factories. Ten thousand new jobs... A racetrack-- -Can you play a hymn? -Who listens to those? -The metro's coming up. -Turn up the volume. Don't be a martyr. We're all selling our bodies. Your secret's safe with me. Don't worry. Shazia, I love you! Yeah! I love you too. -Down with... -Red Rose! -Down with... -Red Rose! -Red Rose! -Down! -No more... -Vulgarity! -Red Rose! -Down, down! Is my baby in a bad mood? What happened, Kitty? Is everyone okay in your family? -Yes. -So, what's wrong? I don't know. Sometimes I wonder if I should be doing this job at all. And then, I think I should just go back home. And what would you do there? -Did you like the chocolates? -They were okay. May have tasted better, if we'd eaten them together. -Should've called me at that time. -I was busy. -You were busy at night? -Do you like the night? More than the day. -Not scared of the dark? -I am. But the stars only twinkle in the dark. Kitty. Pradeep... do you think about me? I do, that's why I call you. I also think about you. Really? But you don't call me. You know I can't, Pradeep. Listen... I've to go. So, good night, baby. Good night. Why can't you just say "Goodnight, baby"? I'm not as daring as you. At least try. Good night, Pradeep. Baby. Okay, bye. Good night. Are apps like Red Rose destroying Indian culture? Or is it just a unique strategy to boost gift sales? We'll continue the debate. Keep watching Noida News Service. With cameraman Ashok Singh, I'm Raghav Malhotra from Greater Noida. Thank you. Kaajal? Come here. -You're all over the news. -I was going to tell you everything-- Girls from decent families don't do such jobs, Kaajal. You should be proud of your sister. A backward caste girl from Bihar is earning so well-- Shut up! Dolly, I'm just doing my job. And smoking, drinking, partying? I know you're going wild. Even I know things. Your Star Heights flat... is never getting completed. How do you know? Did the builder tell you? Yes. What? Kaajal! Kaajal. And Dolly, this purple top with the nuptial chain makes you look like a freak! The gold in your hair doesn't suit you either! I'm doing everything I bloody can to pay for this house! Is the building ever going to be ready? Hello. Dolly, please don't tell my parents about my job. They'll bury me alive. Please, Dolly. -Promise me? -I'm not making any promises. Construction in various new buildings in the city has stopped. Citizens who've invested their life savings... -are burning with anger. -Bloody hell! Look at this. Thank God we've not paid in full. We'll pay the rest when construction resumes. Now you don't need to take the office loan. These bloody builders! Fucking corrupt! Don't stress. You'll pass your exams. What's your breast size? They wouldn't fit in your hands. Shall I gift you some toffees, or plastic roses? Hi, handsome. June here. What happened, Pradeep? Forgotten me? Liar. Keep my heart safe. Hold me tight in your strong arms. Just like that. What's my cutie doing with his hands? June baby, let's talk tomorrow. Couldn't you bloody wait for me? You're jealous. Listen... -now tell me your name. -Only when the time's right. First, call Kitty. You got mad at me today for no reason. Honestly, I was really calling you. It'll relax your muscles. How do you feel? I can't feel anything. Mrs. Yadav, this is a civilized school. With great values. We cannot tolerate this violent behavior. Why did you go to the girls' bathroom? -I had to pee. -But the girls' loo? Makes me feel like one of the girls. He showed me his pee-pee, and his bra! Who wears their mother's bra? You wear a bra too. I wore it inside my shirt. Pappu. Apologize to everybody. What did I do? -Apologize! -Sorry. Mrs. Yadav, an apology isn't enough. We have to take strict action. I apologize on his behalf. I'll... fix him. Want to be a girl? You'll kill him! Stop! Is there a connection between my problem and Pappu's? Dolly? Yes? You asked me to come. Ma? I've been waiting for you. It's been over an hour. You never fixed a date or time. You came here as soon as you got my text? Why don't we go in? Get me a cold drink. Charming dollhouse. -Are you happy? -Yes, extremely. We're getting a fancier house. You were so intelligent and talented, I thought you'd grow up to be a high ranking government official. Then you should've stayed and raised me. Let's get to the point. I called you to answer some questions. I don't need any emotional drama. You think it's funny? Not at all. Sorry. Ask me. Did I ever want to be a boy? You never played with dolls. Math was your favorite. But it wasn't a "boy-girl" thing. How was your sex life? What? Answer my question. With your father... -it wasn't great-- -But with your lover, it was amazing? Right? Dolly, are you happy? I'm... happy and fulfilled with my life and my husband. Extremely happy. My sex life was deeply fulfilling too. -But your lover abandoned you? -But he helped me become free. Congratulations on your freedom. I want you to feel free-- I'm already free! How did you support yourself? I did what I had to do. Why did you abandon me as a kid, bitch? I'm not here to justify my decisions, Dolly. I made the choices I wanted. I wasn't happy with my life. So, I left... that's all. And, honestly... I want to enjoy being a grandmother. My kids don't need a grandmother! I'm a good, dutiful mother. Not like you... a heartless mother who abandoned her child! Do you have... -any more questions-- -No. Please... leave. I thought... I'd stay a few days... with you. We'd have long chats... Never mind. Maybe some other time. I'll get going. How's Kaajal? Why doesn't she visit? Tomorrow's Sunday, invite her. Call her now or you'll forget. I'll call. Call now. The number you are trying to call is currently not reachable. Can't get through. Are you senile? Try again.

You came to this city to be a prostitute? What if your parents find out? I went to see the Taj Mahal. I know how to have fun. Not like you! You've been in Noida for years. You never go out to Delhi, and you've never seen the Taj Mahal! You've done nothing in life! You're surviving, not living! Ready? Let's go. -I think I have a fever. -What? My head's been aching.

Let me enjoy myself till then. Do you have a condom? -Sure? -Yes, I'm ready. Hang on. I'll get it. I love you. Kitty. Kaajal. I love you... Kaajal. I love you. Hope you're not thinking about another client. Huh? I'm kidding. I'm the only one, right? A graveyard can also be heaven. You say strange things. No. Okay, tell me... what would you write on my tombstone? "Osman Ansari. Five twinkling stars." On Rose Day, you give roses to someone you love. It's Rose Day? I wasn't your first, right? It's okay. I'm glad you're my first. I'm older than you, baby, so... I'm not interested in your past experiences. You're not my first... but I swear, you're my last. So, can I claim you as my boyfriend? Yeah, baby. "Boyfriend" sounds good. Love will destroy you, love is painful There's no hope in love Only misery awaits If you walk the path of love Love's a weapon, love's a dagger Searing through your heart Love's unjust, it will punish you It will dig into your heart And chop it into a million pieces Pure love's a poison It'll kill you with its deadly fangs Shakespeare was a fraud And so was his Juliet Today's Romeo dies in vain And Juliet thrives POLICE Sir. Chhatra... Chhatra what? Chhatrasaar Singh. Pradeep. Address... Sir. Can we settle this? If I pay...? Won't happen again, sir. I promise. Go. Pradeep! Your "lover boy" didn't help you get out. He fled. Call somebody from your family. Screw the romance. Call! Keep your sister on a leash. Let's go. Bloody slut. How much was he paying you? Shame on you! I'm not a bad person, Dolly. You're the only one I have. Please, Dolly... Please don't be mad at me. He is a client but... I love him. I didn't take a penny from him, I swear. But he lied to me. Kaajal... You also love your husband. I'm sorry I said those things about him. But you told the truth. Can I get a drink? What? This job you've picked up... Do you like it? The first time I said "I love you" was to a client. Every second client just wants phone sex. Sometimes I hate myself. Am I a whore? And if I'm one, it's fine. I'm just doing my job. Was I forced to sell romance? No. I made that choice. If I'd had other choices, I may not have... Sometimes, I feel it'd be great to have this service for women! I lost my virginity today. My first time and so disappointing! I didn't even climax. I just bled. It's been two years... since I've had sex with Amit. Why? I'm "frozen." What do you mean? In English, it's called "frigid." There is no sensation and penetration is painful... I'm never in the mood. Why? I had my hymen restitched before marriage. I don't know... Maybe it's a side effect. You had a boyfriend in college? And this boy today? He's a delivery boy. I've seen him around. He's sweet... and a little naive. Dolly! It's my new love... whiskey. Ditto. Dolly... Lean back. -Drank too much. -Let me. -It's never happened before. -Don't worry. Please take the baby, she's crying. Kitty! Kitty, listen. Are you crazy? -Let go! -Why are you here? You're married! You have a kid! You're scum! -I was going to tell you. -When? -I was going to. -When? Calm down, baby. We'll talk about this later. Please, baby. I'm not your "baby," Mr. Chhatrasaar Singh. Sorry. I'm a virgin. I mean, I was. Thank you, Mrs. Yadav. I should be thanking you. "To see a world in a grain of sand And a heaven in a wild flower To hold infinity in the palm of your hand And eternity in an hour" According to William Blake, we can live an eternity in just an hour. You don't even know my name. You never told me. Once I get a real job, marry me. Get your business degree and land a fancy job. When you head a big company, I'll see your picture in the paper and feel happy. I'd still want you to marry me. What happened? I'm not "frozen." Really? Good. Good? How can I take you seriously? How do you know your problem's solved? Had sex with Ghanshyam Pandey? Mrs. Yadav? What's gotten into you? Nothing. I'm finally enjoying my tea. Hello. Kitty, this side. Kitty... Hold me tight. Holding you, darling. How much tighter? Come home and hold me for real. -And your wife? -Wife? In the mood for a threesome? Yes, Amit... your wife. What about her? What nonsense! -I've paid you. -I'm serious. Does Dolly know you do this? Dolly? She's too innocent. She can't see the real you. I want to tell the whole family-- I guess this job is too much for you. Need a lift, sweetie? Come on, hop in! You shouldn't have called her parents here. Why not? It's my duty. Kaajal's our responsibility. They should know what job their daughter does. And how do you know? Don't embarrass us, please! You've brought us enough shame already! And now, this? You're blaming me... -but what about Amit using the app? -Don't disrespect your brother-in-law. Come back to Darbhanga. We'll marry you off to a decent man. You can live with dignity. So, don't be an idiot! Bharat. Anything else, Pappu? Which flavor? Two raspberry ice creams. I don't want it. What? Are you not well? I don't want it. On the theme of women's empowerment, world-famous artist Damyanti Rai has made this installation. You'll see it in a few minutes. Ladies and gentlemen, those who aren't lucky in love are always lucky in life. They create their own destiny. I present to you, my new song... "Luck!" Kaajal! Kaajal, I'll abandon everything. My family, my job, everything! -And then? -Whatever you want! You can't give me what I want. Go, your wife's waiting. Hearts will be broken Dreams will be shattered Don't stop hoping You can't stop living Seize the day Find your eternity in the moment Celebrate the fleeting chances Be destiny's child Life is full of surprises Don't stop hoping, you can't stop living Let your heart burn But say goodbye Let go of your love Celebrate life Yoni, Furj, Vagina... It has many names. It's a woman's bliss, her rage, her fire... her freedom. I'm a Noida gal Be warned Dare you look me in the eye I'll give you a black eye DJ Pyaari! DJ Pyaari, admit defeat! Wrap up your console and go home. Shut up, DJ! Take your "builder boy" and get out! This installation is a celebration… How dare she! …of the metaphoric feminine that exists-- Take it down! What the hell is this? This is against Indian culture. Take it down! Get rid of it! Bharat, careful. You left me because he has more money! Is it a crime to think about my future-- -Osman? -Dolly. -Osman, wake up. -Dolly! Amit... Move aside! DIRTY TRADE You did it in our bedroom? On our bed? I don't know who will bury him. You've gone mad, Dolly! Making that "child" your lover! You're just like your mother. What? Where are you going? What does he have that I don't? Is it because he's young? You think I'm senile? Tell me! What? Don't I satisfy you? Huh? What about my needs? Ever thought about me? Will you keep sleeping with young boys all your life? Think you'll be young forever? You tried to touch Kaajal! That was wrong. I only tried. But you? That was consensual. We didn't force each other. Okay, I admit I was wrong. Don't know what I was thinking. I was frustrated, Dolly. We hadn't had sex for two years -That's not Kaajal's fault. -Listen to me. I'll get treated. Counseling, therapy, anything... I'll find a better paying job. You want more money, right? Money? I arrange it all the time. And you never ask me how. I've never gotten a loan. I pawn my jewelry, steal from the office... I ensure we make ends meet. Don't look at me like that. The truth hurts, doesn't it? Forget all that, Dolly. We'll get our new house, our kids are young... Anyway, he's dead. Even during our honeymoon... I hardly felt anything. I thought things would get better with time. But they didn't. I don't desire you, Amit. This pretense of being happy and smiling... I can't do it anymore. Where will you go? I don't know. Bharat, pack some clothes. Come on, Bharat. We're leaving. Pappu, wake up. Hurry up, Pappu. You were right. I'm just like my mother. OSMAN ANSARI - 5 STARS Sir. I was serious about what I offered. All the other girls may quit, but I'll stand by Red Rose. My idea will be successful, sir. I have full faith. I'm proud to work as a voice operator at the Red Rose Romance app. As actors sell performances... we sell romance through our voices. As society modernizes, people are more lonely than ever before. And we try to fill that void. And since women too, feel lonely... we're going to... launch the Ladies Special Red Rose app. Greater Noida is the city of dreams... and we girls, are its future. Thank you. -For me? -Yes. ROAD TO AGRA
