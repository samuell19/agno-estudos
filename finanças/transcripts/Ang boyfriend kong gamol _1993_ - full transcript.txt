You don't even know ABC yet here you are flirting? - Get inside! - Same spot, okay? - Get inside! - Don't be late. Prepare our breakfast! And we will talk! And you! You're stupid! You have no right to look at my daughters. Because we're all beautiful! And you're ugly! Idiots! Ouch! You have an upcoming fight. Make sure you'll win. Ouch! Wait for me here, my stomach is aching. You won't feel the heat because you're wearing a hat and a scarf. Stay here. I'll be right back. Let's go, come on! Let's go! Come on! It's late already. There they are! Hi! Hi! Good morning! What's that? Ouch! Wait. Ouch! It's stuck! It's not moving. What's wrong? Can't you see we're passing? Move out! We can't move it. Look! - Try it! - Go! Help me. I think we hit on something. Then remove it! - Look! - Look! Look! What is it? Mr. Baleno! What are you doing there? Mr. Baleno! Wait. Hey, help me! Mr. Baleno! Mr. Baleno! I'm really sorry, Mr. Baleno. It's your fault anyway. The road is very wide yet you chose this place to hide your very long chin. Now you're blaming me? You broke my chin! It's broken? Yes. Let me see. Ouch, ouch, ouch! Stop it! You're hurting him. We'll take care of him. If you say so. We don't do that on purpose. Do you know why we're not leaving this place? Even if we are surrounded with squatters? Because the land of this barangay belongs to me. We know that, Daddy. Good. Then why are you talking to those morons? They're ugly! They're arrogant! Daddy. That's the title of Dennis Padilla's movie. He sounds familiar to me. Because he looks like you! What?! I am way better than him. He deosn't take a bath. That's why his nickname is "dirt". So from now on, I don't want to see you talking, to our poor neighbors! I said poor... Not egg and sausage. Daddy. That's mine. Ouch! There! - Give it to me! - Hey, give it to me! That's mine, give it to me! What are you doing?! You're so handsome! Smile! - Smile! - Stop it! - Handsome. - You're so handsome. - Hairy. Hairy. - So cute! Very cute. Wait! There! Yes! Ouch! Stupid! Assholes! Ouch! Hey, come back here! Stupid! Faster! Faster! You know mom, after staying so many years in the States, it's so great to be back here in our beloved country. The smell of the air is really different here in the Philippines. I wonder why you still went back here in the Philippines. After inheriting so much money, you should be traveling. Around the world. Well I guess... You need a business partner like me. To manage all of your business affairs. I think Marlene has another plan for the money she inherited. Are you planning to invest here in the Philippines, Marlene? No. Actually, I'm not thinking about business. I want to help our fellow countrymen. Those who are in need. That's unsual. I've never heard of that before. Come in. - Good morning. - Good morning. Marlene, goodmornig. I'm Erma. I'm your girl Friday. But even if it's not Friday, I'm willing to serve for you. Ma'am, I'm Pearl, your maid. You know what ma'am, I am chosen as the most beautiful maid and the sexiest here in this building. Just tell me what you want. Get the suitcases and bring it to the bedroom,okay? - Crazy. - There. I'm so sorry. Would you like to see the terrace? - It's very beautiful. - Okay. - Would you like to see it? - Shall we? We shall, we shall. Marlene, tell me the real score. Why you went back here in the Philippines. Well, for starters, like I said before. I want to help those who are in need. Then I should be number one on your list. You know what, even before, There's one thing that I wanted to make a deal with you. What is it? Tell it to us directly. I would like to make a proposal. A business partnership. With my expertise and your money. We will be unbeatable. Here we go again. What are you looking at? That. That's the squatter area that I want to help. I want to develop it. Marlene, I'm sure your money will not be enough. There are so many poor people. Can we talk some other time? Because we will not understand each other. You know what, hijo, it's been a long trip and we'd like to take a rest. I understand. You must be tired. But anyway, enjoy your stay. Thank you. Hey. Hey Bong! Iron the clothes! You want me to iron the clothes? I'm still doing the laundry, Jesus Christ! I'll be sick! Jesus Christ! Whatever! Very dirty! Ouch! Asshole! Do you own this house? - No. No. - Who? He's inside. Ouch! Oh my… Tuboy! Tuboy! Help me. Help me. - Careful. - Remove it! His eyes, careful. Chong! Chong! - Help us. - What happened? Remove it! Watch his eyes! Move! I'll take care of it. No, not that! Let me do it. I'll do it! Okay, you do it. Assholes! You hit my nose! What do you want? Me? Who put this? The bedspacer? Great, there's a vacant. Come on, let's go inside. Come here, come here. He has a very long nose. You're right. The nail is very long but it perfectly fit to his nose. That's nothing. I can fit this in my nose too. Where's the room? Here. Deluxe. VIP. How could I sleep here? There. It’s like a morgue. Morgue? There's pillow, blanket, mat, electric fan. Seven fifty per day. So expensive. Do you have anything cheaper? - I can't afford it. - Here. Deluxe. What's in there? It doesn't have anything that's in the VIP. Five pesos per day. It's still expensive. I only have two pesos. You have? Well, that's life. It's not easy to earn money. So I have a cheaper room. Here. What's that? Suicide? They're sleeping. Hanging. Why are they tied? If they're not tied they will eventually fall. This is the model community that we're going to build in the squatters area. It's beautiful. But it looks like a resort. Where will the squatters live? Here ma'am, in this building. Where will they work? It's not included. Giving them a clean and comfortable place to live is enough for the poor people. They'll appreciate it. Wait. I think there's a misunderstanding. What I want is…. aside from the accomodation, I want to have a factory for them or a workshop. So that they'll have a good place to make a living. In short I want them to be self sufficient. It's not easy to make that happen, ma'am. - Why? - Their attitude is different. That's true ma'am. Your effort will be worthless. Well gentlemen, if that is your attitude, thank you for your effort. Could you please take over? Ma'am, wait. Where are you going? I thought we will have our dinner? I think I'm going to freak out. Why? They don't understand me. What are you planning? I think I'll just… live in the squatters area. So that I can study about their situation. At the same time, I can think of a way on how to help them. What? You'll live with them? You don't know about their life. You're putting yourself in danger. Until now you're still afraid of thunder and lightning? You sure you'll survive in the squatter? That's just thunder and lightning. Hey! Help me! Help me! Someone is committing a suicide. Hi! You're insane. Beautiful! - Hi! - Hi. Where are you going? Come back here! Enough! If I ask you to give me money, then give! You are so stubborn! Why? Can you live on your own now? Hey! Stop hurting her. It's none of your business! This is our fight. Do you understand? And you, you're a stupid bitch! I said stop hurting her! I told you this is none of your business! Come here! - Come here! - Bitch! You stupid! Asshole! - Okay, punch him! - Punch him! What happened? Ouch! Here. Done? Here. Why? Who? Thief! You’re a thief! Come back here! Come back! I think this is yours. Yes. Thank you. I wanted to thank you also. Because if you didn't show up, I don't know what will happen to me. That's nothing. It's fine. Nothing? We almost broke our faces because of defending her! That's right, you should thank us. - Pay us. - Right. I think you're new here? Yes, you're right. Actually, I'm looking for a place to stay. A place to stay? We have here. She can't, it's fully booked. - No vacancy. - Yes, it's full. There's a vacancy! - Yes, in the… - Yeah, there is. How much? I hope it's not expensive. It's cheap. Cheap? How much? Five. - Hundred. - Thousand. - Thousand?! - Thousand? - Five hundred pesos. - Five hundred pesos. It's cheap but I think I still can't afford it. I'm still looking for a job. But thank you. Wait. Job? We have a solution for that. We need a maid, right? No, no. We need! We need a maid. How much is my salary? Five hundred. Five hundred. Okay. Okay, deal. Okay, deal. In one condition. You will pay half of our.... electricity, one hundred pesos. Water, one hundred pesos. Food, four hundred. Six hundred? So I still owe you one hundred? I'll take care of it. - Really? - My gosh! Okay, if you say so. Do you want to see your room? Yes, may I? Come on, let's go. She's beautiful, right? You're ugly. Give me the blanket. Why? What are you doing there? Sleeping. Sleeping? You mean, you gave me your bed? And you sleep here, sacrificing yourself? It's nothing, I'm fine, I'm used to sleeping here. Why did you get up so early? Of course. I have to get up early to prepare your breakfast. That's my job, right? Wait, you're speaking in english since last night. Why are you so fluent in english? Well, actually, the truth is…. I grew up in Olongapo. Yup. Wow. Okay, I'll prepare the food. Wait, wait, wait. Wait. Okay, I'll… Wait! Sit down. - I have to cook. - No, I'll take care of it. Just sit down. - I have so much to do. - Just sit down. - Okay. - Here, sit here. And while you're sitting, I'll prepare some coffee for you. There. Thank you so much. This is so embarassing. It's fine. And while drinking your coffee, I'll give you something to read. Who's this? He looks like you. Pretty boy? I'm more handsome than him. Wait, I'll read this some other time. I nedd to cook. I'll cook. I need to clean the house. I'll clean the house. - And… - I'll take care of that also. - Ouch, ouch! - Ouch! What's this? I thought we'll eat outside. We're already outside.

Our friend here is very stupid. No, it's fine. I hope you don't mind. Who is she? - Ah she's the… - Our friend. - What? Friend? - Friend? Peaches, she's Marlene. Hi. Hi, - Hi. - Hello. Let's order. Waiter, waiter. There. Okay. One… Oh my. Are you the dead? No. Why do you have a bandage? My tooth is aching. Oh, it's aching. - Let me see. - Is this the menu? This is the list of donations. We'll give it to you later. Yes, we will it later. It's hot. - Yes, I feel that too. - Hot. - It's hot, right? - Yeah, it's hot. Bro, look! Policarpio Pat. Tuwarin. He's already dead for two years, why don't you bury him? We're still waiting for two persons from abroad. Relatives? His wives. What? Nobody loves me. So it's better…. to kill myself. Twenty pesos? For grocery? What can I buy…. for twenty pesos? Chicken. Blessing from the heaven. Well, this will be enough for the seasonings. - Food! - Come on, we're hungry! Yes, it's almost done. Wait a minute. - Wait. - Very slow. Faster! - Almost done. - I can't wait anymore! - Here it is, it's done. - Faster! There! Wow! Tinola. Tinola. It's delicious. What can you say? For just twenty pesos, we have tinola. Delicious and she cooked it by herself. What are we waiting for? Let's eat! Wait. Marlene, you sit here. I'm ashamed. Go ahead. What about you? I'll sit there. Okay. - Can we eat now? - Can we? Yes, you can. Let's eat. Good evening. Mang Baleno. What brings you here? I'm looking for something. Perfect timing, you're about to eat. - Come on, join us. - Thank you. Sit down. Smells good. My favorite. Tinola. Wow. Delicious. But it's hard. They're very excited to eat that's why it is not properly cooked. Mang Baleno. Why did you come here? I'm looking for my chicken. I left my door open. It always fly away. I think it's gone. It's very hard. Where did you buy this? I did not buy it. Who gave you this? It was not given to me too. Where did you get this? A blessing from the heaven. Chicken from the heaven? Yes. You look pale. You should expose to the sun in the morning so you'll have rosy cheeks. - Okay? - Okay. Same color with my scarf. Yes. My chicken has a scarf like this too. Same color. It really look like this one. This feather looks like my chicken's feather. It's just coincidence. Very similar. I can't be wrong. Balisain. Balisain. Why did you leave me? You're heartless. You carved my chicken! Why did you leave me? Mr. Baleno. That's life. We can't decide who will go first. Who knows, the day after tomorrow, you're next. - I will kill you first! - Enough. I will kill you! What's a day care center? It means, with seven children, only one mother will take care of them. Do you understand? Only one mother will take care of them. So that, six of you can find a job, and help their families. Next week, another mother will take care of them. In short, you'll help one another. Is that okay with you? - Yes, it's okay. - We agree.

They're coming! Darling, I'll dive first. It's fun! You sure daddy won't look for us? I'm sure he'll return very late from Beachcol. He won't look for us. You're right. Strawberry! Strawberry! Hey strawberry, where have you been? In our room. Let's go, the disco is about to start. Really? Come on, Let's go! Hi! My daughters! They're now very good at dancing.

Because… since I was a kid, I'm afraid of thunder and lightning. Marlene… I'm afraid it will hit me. It won't hit you. Don't be afraid. You know what? Thunder and lighning means it's going to rain. Thunder and lightning is needed so it will rain. Because the rain… is important to the plants. to the animals. to humans. Do you understand? Like us. So you don't have to be afraid.

What's your problem? Would you like to talk about it? Remember I'm your mother. We only have each other. What's bothering you? Mom. You know what, in the slums... where they didn't get a chance to go to school. I found the guy that I'm looking for. Would you believe, the guy that... I want to be with? What? In the slums? You're beautiful yet the guy that you want to be with is there? Is he handsome? You're not afraid of thunder and lightning anymore? My beloved fellowmen. I think you all know… that the land where your houses are built that belongs to the barangay too, are owned by me. And I guess... No one can say that I refused to help everytime someone needed my help. But now… My beloved fellowmen… I am having a hard time… and I needed you help this time. Will you help me? Yes, we'll help you. If that's the case, I want to ask a favor to all of you. And I hope you'll agree with me. How can we help you? I am asking all of you, my fellow men, to support me with my plan, on selling my land in this barangay, to Señor Gonzales. - No! - We disagree! We disagree! Wait. All houses that will be removed, will be given fifty thousand pesos. Each family! Okay, we agree! I agree! There's more! All unemployed, will be given a job, in the multi purpose shopping center that I am going to build. Now everything's clear. Me and Señor Gonzales will now sign the deed of sale. Sign now! Wait, don't sign it. Excuse me, miss? Aren't you my neighbor before who pretend to be poor, but the truth is you're vey rich? Yes, it's me. What can we do for you? I'm interested on the land that you're selling. - You're interested? - Yes. I'm very sorry. But I already made a deal with Señor Gonzales on the amount of fourty million pesos. I don't break promises. What if… I'll make it… fifty million pesos. Fifty million? I can adjust. What if I'll make it sixty million? Sixty million? You know me, I don't break promises. I'll make it eighty million. And don't you dare offer a higher amount. Because even if it reaches one hundred million, I can still pay more than that. Thank you. We can talk about it. There. Wait. Did you discover mineral here in my land? Gold or oil? No, I haven't. I just want to prove something to a citizen here. That I'm not greedy. And my only desire is… to build a model community. Here in the squatters area. So that… the poor people in this place, can work legally and live appropriately as a human. Time to go home... Go away! Go home! I knew it! You like me, right? - I'm sorry. - I like you too. I feel humiliated! She destroyed my plan! I can't let this happen! Boss. Your frustrations won't help you. You're rich. Powerful. You have so many people. Why don't you use us? If you want, we'll find a way to solve your problem. If you don't want to get hurt, just follow us! - Who are you? - Stop asking questions!

Is that what you call an invitaion? Did they hurt you? Ouch! Ouch! Why did you slap me? We did not hurt them, boss. What do you want from us? I have something, to tell you. A very small favor. I want you to sign this. Absolute. Power of attorney. To manage all of your properties. What do you think of me, a kid? I'm not crazy to sign that documents. Is that the reason why you forcefully brought us here? To force my daughter to sign all of that power of attorney? No mom. I just want to clarify things, before we get married. What? Me marrying you? Why? Don’t you like me? Michael, you're too late. I have waited for your actions for too long. That you will show me even just a little love. Just a little. Or concern. But I never felt it. What did you do? You're so busy… with your business. Money is more important to you. You think you can buy all people. For your information, There are more things important than money. And whatever you say, whatever you do, I will not agree, to sign those documents! And most importantly, I will not agree on marrying a man like you! Do you love your mother? Why? If you'll know, that something bad is going to happen to her, you're still not signing that? Hija, no matter what happens, don't do it. Really?! Do you want me to put a bullet in your mother's throat? Stop! What happened to you? You look so tired. Assholes! You left me! Why are you calling us? Marlene's mom was kidnapped. We don't care about that Marlene. That's your problem. You go alone with her. It's your fault anyway. It's fine with you? - Yes. - Yes. Can you just help us, please? Please? How sad. You know what I'm willing to pay a big amount. Come on guys. Marlene's in danger. What are we waiting for? Attack! Hey, come back here! - Where? - Where? There. Ouch! Ouch! - Go. - Ouch, ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Mom, I'll do it. Marlene. Sign it! Where's Erma? Where is she? I'm here you stupid assholes! Help me. Pull it! Bong. Bong, help me! I'm stuck! I'm stuck! Stuck! Thank God. Don't move! What are you planning? Stay away from me! Stay away from me! Hey, come back here. - Where are you going? - Let go of me! Ouch, it's hot! Get in! What's that? What's that? They got Marlene! Don't go there, we have a car. Right. Wait! That's enough! What's that? Hey! Come back here! You'll find what you're looking for. It hurts! Tom! Tom! Tom. We'll crash! Jump! I don't want to! I said jump! Get ready. Let's die together. Are you hurt? Bong. Bong. Don't leave me, Bong. I need you, Bong. Bong, if you're gone, what about this? What will I do with this? I'll take care of it. You're very greedy! So we're perfect for each other. Why? You look like a piggy bank. Tom. Tom. Tom. Tom, you can't die! You can't! Don't leave me. Tom, I love you. I love you. Tom, I love you.
