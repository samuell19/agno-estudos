Produced by Cine Qua Non in association with Happinet and S-D-P 1965 Iwaki City, Northeastern Japan Hawaiian Dancers Needed HULA GIRLS No one's gonna find us here Kimiko, promise you won't tell anyone Tell what? Just promise Okay You swear? Have I ever broken a promise? Didn't tell anyone when you crapped in your pants, did I? Alright, then Hawaiian dancers? I can't get the coal out when it gets in my nails Not even with soap 18-year-old girls shouldn't look like this If we don't go for this, we'll be stuck here forever Yeah, but... you know how to dance? I know some folk dance, so I'll be fine Basically the same thing You sure? Sure it is Hey! You can't be here! Shoot! Yojiro! You hear? Yojiro, wait up! Did you hear? When Nakago Mine closes, they're laying off another 2,000 One Mine, One Family With the closing of Nakago Mine, roughly 40 percent of personnel, or 2,000 people, will be let go We object! Over our dead bodies! If we don't do this, the company won't survive! Is that all that matters? What about us? Like I said, we'll do what we can We'll work with the union to set up a reemployment office All you do is talk! Get off me! What do you think you're doing? Calm down! Settle down! Mr. Yoshimoto! As part of the new project, we've invited Mr. Yoshimoto from the Hawaiian Center Quiet down, please As you may know, the Hawaiian Center is an enormous project... that will cost 1.8 billion yen to construct, staking the fate of the company on... How many people? Excuse me? After spending 1.8 billion yen, how many people can you employ? Well, right now we're looking at just under 500 What about the other 1,500? Cancel this project now! That's ridiculous! You ain't bringing down our mine over some Hawaii! How was the meeting about the Hawaiian thing? To hell with Hawaii! They ain't gonna spend our hard-earned money on that rubbish! No need to get all serious Just asking Our mine's been here a hundred years No way it's closing down! Even the Emperor himself came for a visit, you know He even stayed in that steam bath of a pit for 32 minutes! But Yojiro and them stay down eight hours Numbnuts, you're comparing me to His Majesty? Who cares about His Majesty? Haven't they taught you anything in school? If other countries don't sell us oil, what'll Japan do without coal? Isn't Hawaii supposed to save our town? Why would anyone build a Hawaii in a freezing place like this? Yojiro, what do you think? You against this Hawaii thing? Of course he is! Don't be asking stupid questions! Joban Mine has spent hundreds of millions of yen each year to pump out the troublesome hot spring spouting from the mountain Well, if there's more hot spring here than we know what to do with, why don't we instead take advantage of it to help solve our debt? That's the innovative idea behind the new Joban Hawaiian Center! Then, does that mean the mine's really closing down? What'll happen to Dad? Gotta do something before the tide of oil swallows us whole To save your family and town, you're the ones who'll rise to the occasion! I can't shake my buns like that They'll see my belly! Oh my My naked body's not for show! Wait, it's not finished yet! The best part's coming up! Don't leave! Let's go Don't go, please! I'm begging you Just three left No, two Three including me But Hatsuko, you've got a kid... What? I can't do it if I have a kid? Well, I mean... Excuse me Was thinking maybe my daughter could be of use for the company Hey, Sayuri, what's the matter? Come on in Raised her all by myself, so she looks a bit like a boy, but ever since she was a baby, she's been crazy about dancing Right? You hear? The dancer from Tokyo's coming today Huh? They say she learned hula dancing in Hawaii and used to star at the prestigious SKD Whatever Wonder if she's as cute as that girl from The Peanuts? What the...? What's going on? That's strange... Ow! Whatcha doing? Beat it, brats You kidnap her, mister? You kids are crazy She's here! Hawaii's here! She's here! Hey, no cutting They're animals Wild, savage beasts... Truth be told, I was one of 'em beasts 'til half a year ago Oh, before I forget, I should give you this Three months' pay, for now So, where exactly is my Hawaii? Welcome Ms. Madoka Hirayama Actually kind of a bland name, no? But she used to be with the SKD revue troupe, only the most prestigious dance company in Tokyo Wonder what she's like... I'm here! What's up with this floor! This here's your teacher, all the way from Tokyo... Ms. Madoka Hirayama! I'm gonna puke... I'll pick you up in the morning - Yoshimoto What is this place?

Your dance skills, of course Dance skills? But we only just... Enough! Ms. Hirayama, shall we start? Don't just stand there Let's start with you, Hatsuko Me? Why me? Where you all going? Don't leave me... Sheesh, what am I supposed to... I dunno what I'm doing It's pointless! Aren't you supposed to teach us to dance? We need to see how it's supposed to be done You don't have to if you don't want to That goes for both of us "The promise under the sun... "was their own little secret..." Jesus... Hey! What're you doing? Hey, Yojiro! It's Hawaii! It's the Hawaii chick! Just put that away! Chill out! Just a little friendly greeting... Hey, she's a looker, huh, Yojiro? Wait, where you going? Come back! Ow! It's stuck! Mitsuo, you idiot! Enough with the greeting Now get outta here Numbnuts, don't embarrass me Hey, I don't care where you're from Don't be acting like you're better than us! It's hopeless Damn, it hurts! This ain't a place for a chick like you! You best get packed up and head back to Tokyo! I'm only here because I was asked to As soon as I'm done, I'm getting out of this dump! Off to school! Study hard, earn that tuition Yes, Mom Minoru, hold your sister's hand! Have a good day See you!

On second thought, I don't think this'll ever work Why coal miners' daughters, anyway? Just bring over some real dancers from Tokyo! We can't do that Come on, that's it! Let's go with pros! The idea behind the Hawaiian Center is... "by and for coal miners..." Coal miners my ass! If you really think these girls can be ready in a few months, you're insulting pros like me Gimme a break! You best stop talking like we're gumbies Yeah it's off our rockers making Hawaii up here But the town's going belly-up if we don't do nuthin' Them girls put up with folks 'round town saying it's rubbish But we gotta do it or @?+/*^&-!

We're in the middle of practice Stay out of this No one in this town's got any business with you You wanna dance around naked for a living, do it alone Don't be messing with our kids Stay cool now, miss... Around here, a woman's gotta raise children and help the men We don't got time to shake our buns and spread our legs like whores It's because of people like you that men keep looking down on women Anyway, I don't care if you were at SKD or whatever If you're some big-shot dancer, why are you here? If you're for real, you'd be dancing on some big stage in the city Bet you're nothing but some castoff Kimiko, we're leaving Wait just a minute! You don't know the first thing about me! Sayuri, hold her! C'mon, go apologize to Mom and eat your dinner I got nothing to apologize for Yojiro, leave that hardhead alone What's so bad about dancing? If I turn pro, I'd earn more than working at the mine Starting tomorrow, you're dressing coal I ain't paying tuition so you can be a stripper Mother... So I'm your slave because you put me through school? I don't wanna live like you! Women can be anything we want now! Kimiko! Your dad would've slapped you by now It's my life!

Joban Music Dance Academy Sorry, had a bit too much to drink From here on, no more sak? for me Beer, please! Have a drink with me Kimiko insisted on being a professional dancer, and she ran away after our mother hit her Now, I dunno what you've gotten into my sister's head, but try not to get her hopes up Hawaii in a freezing place like this? About the silliest thing ever! Better than a drunk miner with no dreams Shouldn't you be looking for your sister? No trains or buses running She's got nowhere to go Why come to a town like this? Guess I pretty much know without asking, though Money, eh? So what? You dig holes for money, right? I don't dig holes, I mine My old man was a coal miner, too Figured mining was the thing to do when we grew up They called it black diamond back in his day Keep digging and it turned to cash But coal's out-of-date now Just 'cause times have changed, we're suppose to change, too? Not our fault the times just went and decided to change Fine, keep blaming it on the times Can't stand women like you Wearing a smug face like you've come this far all by yourself You trying to pick a fight? Check, please And hers, too Thanks but no thanks I don't care about anyone here, okay? Just take good care of Kimiko She's the only sister I've got Um... I can explain Don't bother Let's keep going Stop it Don't listen to her Look... It's okay, you don't have to teach us if you don't want to Yes we are total strangers to dancing but we've got no choice The mine could be closing any day, and when that happens... Actually, I don't even care Well, I do, but... When I saw your dancing, I thought, maybe... things can change Maybe there's a way out Don't write us off like we've got no chance On these conditions You'll listen to everything I say You'll do exactly as I say But... No questions, no objections And no crying under any circumstances If you can promise me that, I'll teach you Yes, I promise! C'mon, Kimiko... Yes or no, which is it?

What keeps you going? I've got nowhere to stay I don't believe you You're too pretty for that Pretty or not, I get kicked out wherever I go Just like the coal miners Well then, you can stay in Iwaki from now on I thought I was an "outsider" Oh, don't be mean to me Ms. Hirayama... Nothing Be careful! Almost there! Let 'em through! Mommy, you're cheating Not cheating It's customer service You guys, I need your attention Listen up! There was a roof-fall accident at the mine this morning We don't have details yet, but among the victims, there was a family member... of one of us My dad and brother had the day off, I think I'm sure they're fine... Sayuri... It doesn't mean he's already passed away Pull it together You're all professionals now But asking them to smile and dance in this situation is a bit... So not being there for a parent is professional? That's right So you're saying we have to smile even at a time like this? There's no way I can't do that Kimiko, say something You're the leader Ms. Hirayama... Go home if you have to Stay if you have what it takes Or that's what I might have said before... Let's go home Get packed up I want to dance I want to dance Sayuri... Please let me dance I'm sure my dad would've said the same thing So please let me dance! Please let me dance! Let's dance Everyone, let's dance! Yeah Let's dance! Well, might as well... Uncle... Where's Dad? Up 'til his last breath, he kept calling your name over and over How could you! It's over now Just go to him This way You imbeciles! Is it really more important to dance... than being there for your parent? I'm the one who told them to dance Please don't blame them But... Unbelievable Yoshimoto, is she for real? You'll pay for this! How could you! Please just go home Mom, you don't understand... I'm asking you, please go home You don't know jack about this town! This ain't a place for a woman like you! Just go back to Tokyo! I understand Ms. Hirayama... Just one thing... You say the Hawaiian's destroying the town, but these girls have put in a lot of effort... just to save this town And now they're fine professional dancers So on the grand opening, please go see what they've accomplished That's all I ask Ms. Hirayama... Don't you want to see the girls before you go? This is your moment of truth, too If this town manages to become Hawaii, everything will be fine Everyone will be happy Don't worry Those girls... will do just fine without me Do you really have to go? Mr. Yoshimoto Thanks for everything, really It's nothing... I'll leave the rest to you Please, take care of the girls A heck of a woman you are now Take care Look at you now I'm begging you, please! What's going on? The idiot's asking for our stoves to keep the palm trees from dying Stoves? The warm water pipes aren't here yet, and the trees are withering If I warm 'em up with some coal stoves, they just might survive That's why we kept saying... this freezing place ain't gonna turn into Hawaii If we give up now, everything will go to waste All the greetings the front desk people practiced, all the hula dancing them girls were practicing... It'll all go down the drain! Please! Can't the union do something? Cut it out I'm begging you! You've gotta do something! Please! To Kimiko Tanigawa From Sanae Kimura Yubari City Kimiko, how are you? Thanks Of course Mom What're you doing? You can't tell? I'm collecting stoves Why? Chiyo! You siding with Hawaii now? You're head of our women's association Chiyo, have you gone mad? My husband... kept mining and mining, saying it's for the country, and died in the mine He was a great miner all right I used to think... working meant gritting in a dark hole even if it meant life or death, but I'm starting to think, maybe it ain't so bad... doing work dancing like that, entertaining folks Mom... It's too late for me, but maybe those girls... can create a world where you can smile and work I'm not crushing their dreams just because some trees are dying! Please, let them borrow some stoves! Let them borrow some stoves! Please loan us your stoves! Let them borrow some stoves! Please loan us your stoves! Please! Take mine Thank you Thanks! Hang in there, Christina We're almost there!
