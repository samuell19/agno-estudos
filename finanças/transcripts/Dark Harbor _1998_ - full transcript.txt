Do you think we're going to make it? I certainly hope so. Well, don't get carried away. I' m not getting carried away, l' m just trying... Make sure we live first. I don't think doing 65 on Route One make us Bonnie and Clyde. We'd hold up Fort Knox, and we wouldn't be. Just keep your eyes peeled. Okay? I mean it, I need some help here. This is like hydroplaning through the goddamn Bayou! Don't blame me because you were 2 hours late. -What's wrong with you? -Nothing, just watch the road. -Slow down. -What is it? -Stop. -What do you mean, stop? -We' ll miss the boat. -No, really, I saw something. -Saw something? What? -David, stop! Jesus. Is he alive? -No! -What? Don't touch him. We should call the police and not get involved. -lnvolved? He needs help. -So, we' re calling the police. -But shouldn't we... -No, trust me. No. No cops. Do you know where you are? -Sort of. -What happened to you? Can you move? -l' m calling the police. -I said no cops. -We've got a boat to catch. -David. Alexis, please, let me handle this. We can't help you if you don't let me call the police. Then don't help me. Would you like a cigarette? Please. There's nothing in Lincolnville but some payphones... ...and the ferry... ...and Pen Bay hospital is only a few miles from here. Why don't I just swing by. I recommend you get looked at. No, that's okay. No doctors either? Next thing, it' ll be no lawyers... ...and we' ll all be out of business. -Time's your boat leaving? -28 minutes. How far is it? About thirty miles. Cutting it kind of loose, huh? We wouldn't want to set off any radar guns now, would we? Maybe you should pick it up a bit, dear. Sorry. It's not your fault. So long. -Thanks for the lift. -Are you sure you' re okay? Yeah, l' ll survive. Okay then, bye, now. Wait. He said he' ll survive. -Naw, really. -Please, take it. -Be careful. -Thanks. See you around. I suggest you scrub that hand with ammonia... ...as soon as possible. Why, you wanna hold it? Jesus! Who taught you to be such a snob? I think it's sweet. Yeah, so are circus dwarves. I' ll try and rustle up something edible. Any requests? I think I saw a Beluga and Dom twin-pack in the coke machine. -What do you want? -Surprise me. Oh, God, you scared me. -Sorry. -Any luck? Wow! Remember when the ceiling collapsed in Mustique? How could I ever forget? We had to sleep out in that gazebo. I remember, it's that goddamn scorpion going for my jugular. It was a grasshopper, and it grazed your foot. Lexie, what the hell are you doing? I was watching that. Two shots and you turn into Mae West. What's wrong? Christ, we forgot about the food. -What food? -On the dock. You can't ring Mike and Mary at this hour. I' m not gonna let ...worth of salmon sit out all night. Mike? I wanted to let you know we missed the last boat. If it's not too much trouble... ...could you buzz over and grab the groceries? Great, so it works out either way. Thanks. Go back to sleep. Good night. They never made the drop. -What are you doing? -Going to sleep. -With your coat on? -Yep. Good night. Okay. Good night. I wonder what happened to that guy. -What guy? -From last night, on Route One. Right, " Mr. No-Cops". What about him? Nothing. I was just wondering. Wondering what? If he's alright, that's all. That's not funny. I know, l' m sorry. -But... -But nothing, that hurts. Right, I have retinal damage, isn't that hilarious? God. I better go get myself a cup of coffee... ...before you have an aneurysm. Boat coffee, living on the edge. Yeah, that's me, Wild Dave. Did you remember to bring the camera? -I don't know, did l? -I think so. Yeah, you' re right, I did. Is this gonna be a whole thing? I' ll see you at the house. It's just a mushroom. Guess who I saw on the ferry deck? -Who? -Jack Hoffman. Busy at molesting some teenage bimbo in daylight. Surprise, surprise. Poor Margo. Poor bimbo. Would you be that open? I don't know. Wanna have supper at the Blue Heron? -Tonight? -Yeah. I thought it might be fun. Maybe dance a bit. Nah, let's just have a quiet one. Are you sure? Yeah, I don't know, l' m just not... You' re not what? In the mood. I see. Another quiet one. Well, what do you want, then? -For dinner? -For dinner. -How about lobster? -Lobster's fine. Lobster it is. I' ll have Mike swing over. No, l' ll go. -You sure? -Yeah, I could use the ride. Come on, baby, Wild Dave is taking you for a ride. -What in God's name? -Just go with the flow. Where to? Where did you agree to become Mrs. Weinberg? -Are you serious? -Next stop: Twin Bards. -What about the lobsters? -We don't need them. David. Get in the boat... ...my love. Fuck. What's wrong? Take the tiller. How does it look? David, it's pretty tricky, why don't we head back? Give me the read. O, eight-seven... ...o, eight-nine... ...o... ...eight-six... it keeps moving. Head up. Take her to a hundred and hold your course. Why don't we just head back. We can beat it to Brackett. Nonsense, where's your sense of adventure? -There they are! -You've got the Twins? Edge her four degrees to port... ...and we' re dead-on. Steady. Hold her right there. I hope you know what you' re doing; l' m not impressed. Honey, have a little faith. Lex? Yeah? Are you okay? I' m fine. I was looking. I didn't see anything coming. Don't worry. Get the flares. Get the flares, right. We don't have any flares. -What? -Fourth of July, remember? -You didn't replace them? -I didn't think... Exactly, you didn't think. Make sure we' re not sinking. -Wait here, l' ll go check. -Check what? -We don't know where we are. -We' re on land... ...unless that's a UFO. -l' m coming with you. -Stay here, watch the boat. David! How was I supposed to know? What's he doing, stalking us? David, do you think so? Thank God. Glad to see you guys are happy. No, we' re not, we' re just glad you' re right. I didn't know it was you. I just heard my wife scream. It was instinct. I've been seeing a lot of instinct lately. This oughta hold us till it lifts. When will that be? You know what they say about Maine... ...if you don't like the weather, wait 5 minutes. No, we' re fine, thank you. Your wife looks hungry. Thank you. How did you end up out here, If you don't mind me asking? I couldn't find a spot to settle last night... ...so I ended up crashing on the ferry... ...and before I knew it, she was moving... ...and when we landed I just started roaming around... ...the town. -Haroldsberg. -Right. I ended up finding, well... ...sort of borrowed a little boat. Borrowed? He really is a lawyer, isn't he? We get the Harvard Law Review every month. So anyway, l' m just... ...sort of zoning out a bit... ...when all of a sudden, sun goes off like a light... ...then banged into this place... ...grouped up past all these screaming seals. That's when I heard: " Hello, hello". -Seals? -Yeah, tons. -My God, this must be... -Seal Rock. No shit. Captain Compass, I ' m not the one who veered off course. I didn't exactly have a radar, did l? -You want one? -She doesn't smoke those. So, what exactly is it... ...that you do, anyway? What do you do to support yourself? Nothing much. Is that a full-time occupation? Yeah, I guess you could say that. Let's see, no cops... ...no home, no job, no name, no nothing. You should run for President in 2000. Country could start fresh. That's it, further out! She is almost free. Keep swinging. You' re probably wondering about the road last night. No, not really. David was a little curious, but l... It's okay. Let's just say... ...sometimes people... ...sort of catch you when you' re down... ...and try to take advantage of you. Then when they find out they can't... ...well, they make you pay. Honey? -Yeah! -Where is the sugar? Where it always is. Oh, right. Sorry! You have a beautiful home, Mr. Weinberg. Thanks. It isn't mine exactly. My great grandfather built it. -It's beautiful. -Thank you. Hot, hot, hot! -Thank you. -Thanks, hon. You earned it. I want you guys to know how much I appreciate this. It's been along time since I've been inside. -It's our pleasure. -Warm shower... ...never hurt anyone. Another day, another day. Let it die. I' m beat. How about you, honey, you tired? Yes, David, l' m tired. You don't have to be. I know, sweetheart, but I am. I' m exhausted. No! Let him sleep. What do you mean, let him sleep? He's not supposed to sleep over. I know, but he fell asleep. That's what sleeping over is, falling asleep. Come on, you can't throw him out. Where's he gonna go? Please, he lives on roadsides. What would people say if they knew who we had here? The paranoid schizophrenic standing in front of me? I offer a quick shower, and now we' re harboring a fugitive. Fugitives who give you bread after you smash their heads in. If you' re afraid, why'd you drag him back here? What, and leave him out there after he helped us? Exactly... ...helped us. Great, now l' m Mr. Bad Guy. You' re not Mr. Anything. In fact, do what you want. I' m going to bed. I' m tired. You want me to go, right? No, not at all, I just couldn't sleep. I thought you might need a blanket. Thanks. Wanna have a seat? Can I ask you something? Sure. Do I make you nervous? No, not at all. Are you sure? Put it out. -Who do you think you are? -You know who I am. What are you doing here? I never left. Take off my boots. You are up. Clever. Good morning, gentlemen. Sorry about dozing off like that last night. Don't be silly. How's your head? I' ll live. Thanks for the blanket, by the way. You' re welcome. I thought you might be cold. I was. Thanks. That was sweet, dear. -Are you hungry? -Already ate. -Hope that's okay. -Of course it is. Great, the phone's dead. It's probably the storm. Give it a few. -Sugar? -Two spoons. Thanks. Oh, my God! David, it looks amazing. Not bad. Not bad at all. If you do say so yourself. Well, a man of hidden talents. -You did this? -Just wanted to say thank you. Anyway, after I weaseled out... ...of the vodka-Santa Claus Fiasco at Cheltenham... ...I show up at Yale thinking: "Okay, time to crack down". But of course tragedy struck me before I ever unpacked. I had the misfortune of being struck down... ...by the most deadly pair of wild blue eyes... ...God ever had the audacity to create. -He was a junior from El Paso. -A Texas boy at Yale. Yeah, with a bad habit of stealing horses... ...at four in the morning, and sneaking into my window... ...with waffles and a bottle of Wild Turkey. He was nuts. So whatever happened to him? My mother scared him off and she married a Du Pont. What's a " Du Pont"? An obsolete tribe from Delaware. What about you, have you ever been in love? Naw, not in any sense of the word. This was so good. Glad you liked it. Now l' m set for a good month. A month's a long time. I know. So, are you two, going across any time soon? -Across? -The water; to the ferry. I hope you don't think you' re leaving, do you? Yeah, I thought l... I' m sorry, you must not know the rule. You didn't tell him the rule? What rule? If you come to my house, and do what you did... ...then you have to accept the following challenge: Delay your windy departure until this evening... ...so that I may match this formidable feast... ...with a modest meal of my own; the victor be determined... ...by the eminent culinary critic... ...Alexis... ...Chandler Weinberg... ...whose impeccable taste has only grown... ...more precise and unforgiving... ...over the years. Rules are rules. Yes! Nine. Serving two. You haven't got a prayer if you let me get under it like that. You' ll get that later, right? Game point. -Fuck! -l' m sorry. I' ll get it. -Be my guest. -See all that green stuff? It's poison ivy. Clever. -Cowardly is more like it. -Alright. Put the knives away, l' ll get the goddamn birdie. Careful. -Easy, easy. -Hold still, be a man. That thing feels like a Brillo pad, you be a man. -Honey? -Yeah? Will you put some cream on my back? In a minute. Lower. -What are you doing? -Going to play gold, what else? Really, thanks for warning me. I told you last week. Where the hell's my glove? -No, you didn't. -Well, actually, I did, but... ...Larry Cohen has Lasker teed up for me on the first hole... ...so I don't have time to play Alzheimer's poker with you? -The famous Lasker deal. -The one and only. What's it been, two years now? Somebody has to do the dirty work around here. Don't embarrass yourself, David. I think you' re projecting, dear. I' ll get the lobsters. Dig up some steamers... ...and please don't forget the mushrooms. Where's... what's his name? Still zoned out on the hammock? Have him run a comb through his hair. Larry might stop by for a scotch after golf. -Put some clothes on, will you? -Yes, sir. I love you. Sorry. Sorry. I just came in here to shut my eyes, if that's alright. I didn't mean to wake you. No, it's okay. -What time is it, anyway? -About three. -Where's...? -David. He's playing golf. I think you might've left one of these by the hammock. I' ll pick it later. Looks like quite a collection. Yeah, every once in a while, I float something out there. Are you a writer? No, I wouldn't go that far. Mind if I take a peek? Only if you don't mind. No. Wait, why are these all in different handwriting? 'Cause different people wrote them. -You said that... -No, they' re my words. I just don't write them myself. Mind if I ask why? 'Cause I never really learned how, that's why. That's every funny. I hope the transcriber wasn't a nun. I don't think so, check the bottom corner. Sandy Diamond? Oh, Randy. Sweet fella. Ran a scuba clinic in Des Moines. A scuba clinic in Des Moines? You should've seen the " Ashram" in Vegas. I think l' ll pass. You' re gonna get that later, right? Can I get you something? Are you hungry? No, thanks. If you need anything, let me know. That's our honeymoon in Capri, I look awful. We got that in Prague. Said it belonged to Mussolini. My dad shot that in Kenya. Where's this from? -You don't mind, do you? -No, not at all. Help yourself. Want some? Sure, just a touch. So anyway, Clarice drags me to Bloomies go get... ...all my new boarding school stuff... ...and I fall in love with these horrid red pumps. -Nine years old, huh? -10, thank you very much. Anyway, the big day comes, l' m all packed up and waiting... ...in the car to take me to the airport to pick up mummy... ...who came from Munich to get me up to school... ...when all of a sudden... ...Lulu starts reading the Bible to me. Who's Lulu? She was the new nanny. Clarice got fired the week before. -Why? -I don't know. She drank. Anyway, when we got to the airport... ...I was so excited... ...I ran like a madman to meet mummy at the gate... ...but instead of hugs and kisses... ...all I got... ...was a dead cold glare. Not a big fan of red pumps. What? You' re it! Wait, I can't...! -Sorry, are you okay? -Better be, you' re it. Push! Harder! Hold it right there, partner. My name's Tex, what's yours? Wilma. Funny, you don't look like a Wilma to me. Yeah? Who do I look like? I'd think you look more... ...Iike a Marilyn. Alright, l' m afraid you got me. Yeah, I think I do. I think I got you, too. Yeah? How's that, Miss Monroe? -'Cause your name isn't Tex. -ls not? What is it, then? Jack. Jack? Happy birthday... ...to you. Happy birthday... ...to you. Happy birthday... ...Mister President... ...happy birthday... ...to... ...you. Ready? Hello? Earth to Mars. I' m sorry. Can I ask you a favor? Sure, what is it? I've got something on the tip of my tongue. Would you mind helping me before it slips away? Okay, sure. Shoot. It's funny... ...your worst nightmare... This is it? -Yeah. -Sorry. It's funny, your worst nightmare... ...always seems so far away. Then, all of a sudden... ...there it is... ...Iike a monstrous tidal wave. You try to escape, but you can't. You struggle... ...you struggle... ...you struggle... ...your desperate cries unheard. Then something strange happens: You stop struggling. Your cries take flight... ...and you forget you' re drowning. Yeah, your John Hancock. Now we can go. So how' d you and David meet? I lost my mind for a few years after college... ...and he saved me. Sounds like a good deal. I hope we get lucky. So, where are they? Be patient. It's not so simple. When they' re here... ...they' re hidden. When they' re not... ...you think they are... They' re clever. They' re fickle. They feel you coming and then they hide. Hey. Not bad... ...but guess what? -What? -You killed it. You have to break it above the bulb... ...otherwise no more can grow. But you have great instincts. It's a "chanterelle". David's gonna love you. I' m in love with you. I know it's kind of sudden, but... ...now that I've laid eyes on you... ...well, it's just all over. I wouldn't do that if I were you. The Amanitus Muscarius is a rare coastal mushroom... ...originally used by the lroquois to combat red malaria. It also happens to be... ...a highly potent aphrodisiac. Then there's its infamous sister the Amanita Rubinica. Affectionately known as the " Purple Julie"... ...it' ll kill you in less than a minute. Guess what they have in common? What? They' re twins. How can you tell them apart? " Purple Julie", purple poison. The Amanitus Muscarius. -The aphrodisiac? -Right. How do you know so much about mushrooms? My father. He used to drag me out here from the time I'd walk... ...and go on about their differences, their stories... ...their flavors and their powers, everything. Should've seen his eyes when he talked about them. Pure magic. Does he still come out here? He committed suicide when I was eight. -l' m sorry. -Don't be. He's better off. What about your mom? We don't speak. Why's that? She hates David. Pick a hand. What are you doing? Behave. I am behaving. No. Let's go, it's getting late. Are you coming? I have to be getting back. Look, I just want to tell you... -I'd like to say... -Apology accepted. -Hello. -Hi, honey. How' d it go with Lasker? You've been gone forever. David, are you okay? Yeah, it's just... -I had some bad clams. -You had clams? After golf? But I got clams for dinner. -I know. -Why'd you only get 2 lobsters? Well, I just... Because I didn't think I want to eat any dinner... ...'cause of the clams. Right. And Larry? He didn't come back with you? No, he didn't... He said to say hi. Hi from Lasker, too. I should sit down. I think I need a compress. Will you go into the kitchen and get me a wet cloth? Lex, he doesn't know where anything is. I' ll go. You have a very loyal wife. I think tonight's not such a good night... ...for this food showdown. I' m gonna put him to bed... ...and run you over to lslesboro, okay? She may be right. We should probably take a rain check. Okay, but I got to say... ...I was kind of looking forward to the challenge. You know what, so was l. I fact, I think a warm shower... ...and a cold drink will put me right back in the swing. -David, I don't think... -Exactly, don't think... ...drink! It's amazing, David. So did you two have a good day? I gave him the grand tour. How did you like it? It was nice. -Good luck. -Thanks for everything. See you in twenty. Call the phone company, it's still out. Done. Here, this is for you. How about that? -How thoughtful. -I made it here. It's very nice, thank you. What are you doing back here? Is everything okay, where's David? We got in a little... He's outside closing up or something. -You got in a little what? -Jam. Boat died. -Had to paddle back. -l' m sorry. I' ll be right back, do you need anything? A sea plane would be nice. There you are, poor thing. What happened? The boat conked out halfway there. It was a nightmare. -I know, I heard. -Did you? -Yes, I did. -So, I guess James Dean ...is gonna be making himself at home. We could always call Mike and Mary. What are you gonna do, scream across the bay? -Right, the phone. -The phone. Why is this all my fault? You think I want him here? -I don't know, do you? -No. Good. That makes two of us. You know... ...I look at you... ...and it' s funny... ...you don't remind me of myself exactly... ...but you remind me of a certain time in my youth. I remember what I used to think love was then. I thought it was the fireworks... ...the explosions... ...the highlights. But it's not. It's time. To go through seasons together... ...through change... ...through the ups and downs... ...to be able... ...to look your beloved... ...in the eye and say: " We did that, together... ...as one". " We chose each other... ...above all others". That is... ...Iove. It's unexplainable. It' s a secret... ...that can only be known... ...once... ...you've done... ...the time. It's nice what you said downstairs. I meant it. What a weekend, huh? You' re telling me. Sorry I left you alone today. Don't worry. So everything was okay? Yeah, you know? You weren't bored or anything? No, not especially. I mean, I wasn't not bored... ...I' m glad you got to do what you wanted. Good. Just as long as you were not bored. Morning, sweetheart. Morning. What's wrong? Look in the mirror. -Christ. -Want me to put Calamine on? -No. -Suit yourself. -How long have you been up? -I don't know, an hour. Are you ready? Almost. Are you? Got over an hour. Where's your watch? -l' m not wearing it. -You always wear it. Not today. So, where's our little friend? Outside, I think. -I better take care of the boat. -It's done. -What do you mean, it's done? -He did it. -When? -This morning. Said it was a loose spark. Speaking of the Devil... -Morning, David. -lt' ll be ready in a minute. Cool. What' ll be ready in a minute? -My shirt. -His shirt. It was still wet this morning. -Don't you have another one? -Nope. Don't, it's going to spread. Where else can it spread? I' ll just go and see if your shirt's ready. I like your face... Your watch. The face is cool. Alexis gave that to me. It's beautiful. We fixed the phone, by the way. Alexis and me. -Really? When? -This morning. Woke me up... ...and asked me to hold two wires together while she taped. Any calls? -Thanks. -So, you' re quite the mechanic. It was nothing, I found the cable cut out back. It's probably raccoons. -Good for you. Any calls? -No. There were 2 messages in Boston. Larry called Boston. Lasker looks 50-50. Tom is desperate for squash. He's always desperate. Did you call anybody? No, why? No reason. I was wondering if it was calling out or not? Of course it is. How do you think I checked the machine? Yeah. Would you like anything? -No, thanks. -Come on, eat something. How about a banana? Dab of milk would be nice. -So is everything okay? -Yes. Thanks. Okay, bye. Who was it? -Mike. -Good, are they coming by? Still in Portland with Mary's mother. They' ll be back tomorrow. Mary says hi. What's so funny? I don't know. Couples, I guess. Couples? Maybe someday, you' ll look in the mirror... ...and have a snicker to yourself. Come on, David. Here it comes. I don't want one. You always have a banana. Not today, so next time you feel the need to generalize... ...you can say: " You almost always have a banana". Thank you, David, maybe I won't say anything at all. -May I have a cigarette? -Yeah. There's more in the fridge. Would you like a glass? -Would you like a glass, David? -No, I wouldn't. But thank you. Are your hands dirty, Alexis? Excuse me? I was wondering why you were cleaning a clean glass. I thought maybe it was because your hands were dirty. I don't know what kind of poison is flowing through you... ...but whatever it is keep it to yourself. Sorry about this. I know this isn't as much fun as the boat house... ...but life isn't all cowboys and lndians, is it? Is it? What in God's name are you trying to accomplish? It's not too bright in here, is it? Honey, would you close the shades for him? You know how much he likes the shades closed in the day. All right, l' ll do it. -You bastard. -I was setting the right mood. Maybe you should go outside and take a walk and cool down. -Should l? -Yes, I think you should. Wouldn't that be convenient? Especially if I kept walking and then you and Valentino... ...could call all your friends and maybe even " mummy"... ...if she' ll take the call, and you let them know that bastard... ...with his endless mood swings and depressions... ...is gone once and for all; the gold-digging kike... ...who squanders the family millions... ...and makes everyone miserable... ...is finally out of the picture. Wouldn't that be a relief? No more deadbeat days, no more sleepless nights... ...no more David Weinberg. Wouldn't that be a dream? I feel so sorry for you. Yeah, you better be sorry for me. Who wouldn't feel sorry for me? Seven years stuck in a coffin with you. A coffin? A coffin. Are you sure you want to say that, David? I was sure the day I married you. I just didn't have the courage to admit it. Have I gone too far? Should I not be honest? There she goes: the Lexie Chandler we all know and love. When in doubt, shut them out! Shut, shut, shut. Shut, shut, shut, shut them out! Shut them out till all the doors are closed. She's dragged us all down into her coffin... ...just like daddy. Get out. Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out. Excuse me? Get out. David, no! David! David, l' m begging you please... No! He's all yours, Lex. Get off my island, David. Your island? My island. Alas! The wolf... ...sheds her wool. Alas! Are you okay? Where is he? Gone. Did you call the police? No. No cops. What are we going to do with that? It's funny... ...your worst nightmare always seems so far away. Then, all of a sudden... ...there it is... ...Iike a monstrous tidal wave. You try to escape, but you can't. You struggle, struggle and struggle... ...your desperate cries unheard. Then something strange happens. You stop struggling. Your cry takes flight... " Your cry takes flight. ...and you forget you' re drowning. And you forget you' re drowning". Those were the departing words... ...of a unique woman of courage... ...for whom the struggles of life... ...had become too much to bear. Let me implore you, however... ...amidst your sorrow... ...to remember little Lexie Chandler... ...the incarnation of pure innocence... ...and wondrous joy... ...bounding barefoot... ...along the rocky shores... ...of Dark Harbor. That was a beautiful service, Paul. David. Alexis. Tale off the glasses, David. Her suicide note. Thank you for coming. Finally. How are you? I have had some bad nights. Well, I am here now. That is... ...all I wanted. You proved it. I hope so.
