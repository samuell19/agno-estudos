It’s your brother speaking How come you called at this hour? Where are you? I'm in Gajuwaka godown. Listen to me carefully. Tell me brother. - I found the killer of our son and son-in-law. I'll mail you their video clippings. Show it to our family and ask them to be careful Okay. It’s not safe for you to be alone. Shall I send Chalapathi? - It’s all right. I will take care. Where are you, Srinu? Someone cut the fencing here. Who must have cut it? Hey. - Hey. Security. Where the hell are you guys? Security… Nothing but ashes is left. We confirmed it’s your brother’s body after examining the teeth. It was a very cruel person that killed him. He was killed quite brutally for his age. I am very sorry, sir. Veerabhadram must have done this for sure. We are in pain and he is celebrating there He is not human, He is a monster. [ Fire crackers bursting ] - [ Drums sound ] Come on boys! What is this noise? Stop it. Stop it I say. Brother-in-law, - Yes. Brother-in-law, have this sweet. - Is it your birthday today? It’s our enemy’s death day. That is why we are celebrating. Someone killed Sripathi in his factory only Damn! He slapped me. Idiot. How is our enmity satisfied when someone else kills him Can someone else get married on your behalf? Is your hunger fulfilled when someone else eats? We should only kill our enemy - Yes, we should kill him. I planned everything to kill Sripathi. But someone else killed before us. We should only kill anyone related to Raghupathi’s family. That is when our revenge is sought. That becomes a celebration for us. Sir, Mr. Raghupathi is here. Greetings, sir. - Greetings. I would have come if you informed. It is not respectful of me to call a Government officer to me Take a seat, sir. I heard about your brother. I am very sorry, sir Did you find anything about the murderer? We are working on it, sir. Are you suspicious about anyone? We have many businesses. Business is common in competetion. We don’t realize who is our enemy and who is our friend. We already lost three lives in our family. We are not ready to lose another one. Ask Chalapathi for any further information. We'll leave. Good sir. Brother… Auditor has called from Bangalore. There is a meeting with the foreign clients. He is asking you to come urgently Go. - Ok. Come. How far is he? According to his mobile signals, he will enter the highway in 10 minutes. Brother. - Did you find anything? You have guessed it right. Veerabhadram is not connected to the murder Who must have done it then? Only two pairs of shoe marks were found outside the burnt godown. There are no other clues. So, two people… Who are they? Ganapathi just went out. Ask him to come back Get ready. Ok. - He will be in range in a minute Tell me, Chinna. - Uncle… Dad is calling you home immediately. Stop the vehicle. What happened? He was in our range. He took a U-turn just before we were pressing the trigger No problem. His death is written somewhere other than the highway. Let's go. What is it? I said I had some work with the auditor. Why did you call me midway? I'll speak with the auditor. Bangalore is not our head office from now on. It's our place. How will we manage such huge businesses from home? We have to. Reduce the volume. - Dad, Do you want us to stay home afraid of someone? Pandavas didn’t go on exile being afraid. Situations demanded that I am not afraid like you all assume. It's my responsibility. We have a second enemy we are not aware of. But he knows us. So, let us all stay together and find out about him. When will you find out? You couldn’t find out despite being so rich How long can we protect our women at home? Brother-in-law’s wife is a widower already. Get our daughter married to someone far away from us. She would be safe there. Brother looked for an American alliance before dying. I liked it too. The guy is arriving in two days. He said he would get married right away if everything goes well Ok brother. We will get her married and send her to America. Are you happy now? I'm very happy. Quickly… Give it. What? Masala smells great. What are you preparing?? - Eggplant curry. You have done enough. Let us do it now. If anything goes wrong, uncle would yell at us. Not possible. I will be cooking today and you will be eating it Let her do it. She would have to cook from tomorrow anyways Are you going to your mom’s house? - No... We are sending you to your in-law’s house Like that’s going to happen. Your dad said a guy is coming to see you from America in four days What? Marriage with a guy from America? That’s not happening. I will only marry a guy who stays here with us. Tell that to your dad not us. I will. I am not scared of him. Brother... - Aunt... please... don't do it. That’s right. How is it, dad? Did I put too much of anything? Yes, dear. What is it, dad? I measured everything You put too much of taste, dear. Look mom, she already started cooking well as we spoke about wedding. Dad. I just learnt to cook and you are already sending me to America You should get married someday, right? But when you are in pain here, how can I lead a happy life there? It’s not even the neighboring town. It’s America. We don’t even know about the guy’s nature Oh, Is that your worry? He is Krishna Prasad. He is working at Microsoft. Good salary. But as you would have to marry him let us know if you fault him anywhere. We can cancel the alliance. I will get to know him and tell you. Okay? You will definitely say that he is a good guy Sister, to cancel the alliance like uncle said, You should find flaws in the guy Guys from our town are only flawed in many ways. He is coming from America. He must be greatly flawed. He might be. But how will you find out? Savitri uncle will handle it. Bloody clothes… I feel irritated. I might die of suffocation before the plane arrives. I will go change and come Don’t you dare! You can’t change until the groom arrives. When will he come? When will I be out of these clothes? Sorry, sir. Swachch Bharat doesn’t mean apologizing after committing the mistake. You have to implement it. That’s when our country will flourish Ok, sure. You're Mr. Raghupathi’s son Mahendra, right? Yes. And you? Krishna Prasad. You're Prasad? Didn’t I tell you he looked like Prasad? We expected you to land in a suit. Your attire confused us a bit. Shake hands with him everyone. - Thanks. Greetings everyone. Why are you all in suits? - We wanted to impress you. Isn’t it making us all uncomfortable? Mr. Prasad, give us two minutes. We will change on our way Let's go. Brother… He is great. He could sense our discomfort right away. All right, get in. - Ok, brother. Halt at some hotel on the way. We will get changed Ok brother. Go and follow that car Have you finished the Ragupathi Son-in-law and Son? No Sir, Only his team was there in the vehicle!! Then, where are they? Our driver isn’t picking up my call. - He will not. What do you mean? Veerabhadram. This rail journey is due to that. Give me that suitcase. I will hold it It’s all right. I will carry it. - Your hands might hurt. Even my leg hurts. Will you carry me in your arms? How is that possible? That is why you should stick to your work. What is it now? You want to carry something heavy, right? Uncle… - What, son? Give it to me. Here… Why do you strain yourself? Lift it. Happy now? Come… Are they coming? - Yes. They are Hey, where's your seat? Put the bag under our seats. Isn’t he handsome? - That’s not enough. He should be more than that. - What else? He has the discipline to mind his own business. He has all the traditional values of a family man. He respects elders. Looks like he can’t be faulted. You can’t say that. Savitri uncle will decide. That is why uncle told us to come here. Train is moving. Where is Savitri uncle? Dear, come fast... Come fast Train is moving. I'm coming. - Come. come. Come fast. Train is leaving. Give me your hands. Thanks aunty. - He is my husband. Is it? Hello. You left your husband for me, right? - Damn! you.. He is your husband at the end of the day. Get down at the next station and come together. Thanks Uncle, you are right on time. The moment I arrive at is the right time. Where is he? - He is the one in the dhoti. Oh... He looks quite innocent. I will expose the wild angle in him. Switch on your camera. I will show it to everyone at home and get the wedding cancelled Move. Move. [ Chuckles ] What are you doing here, uncle? Are you just coming casually? - No. I have some work. Savitri uncle is a great ad filmmaker. He stays in Hyderabad. Come on, sir. You will not have this offer again. Buy one Get four free. Hello… I am Savitri Sarkoji, the famous ad film director Hello, Mr. Krishna Prasad… He came to meet our Sruthi from America I can make it out from his look. So… You're from America… Yes. - Which part of America? New York. You're a software engineer, right? He is speaking fluent Telugu though he is from America. You were born and brought up here but you are speaking in English When will our country develop with these ideologies? This country won’t develop as long as you are alive Have some fruit and go to sleep Do you smoke? It’s okay. Try once. Smoke one. If I start smoking, I don’t stop with one. Hey American boy… Come on… Take it. Light it. Why did you throw it away? You wasted 150 rupees. This serves you right, idiot. You old fellow... I've added 30 minutes to your life span Oh... Thank you. You look so handsome. Do you have any lovers in America? Come on. - You are blushing. So, there is someone for sure. Everyone here is young except that fool. Tell us. Two girlfriends or three? Two. Two girlfriends. One being my job and two being the girl in my life Look… What kind of a girl are you looking for? Nothing much… I need a girl who loves her husband like her father Oh... What are the qualities in you? I gave my first salary to mom. I wish to give my first kiss to my wife Great! Well said, son! Only when embody Lord Rama, we can hope to get a girl like Goddess Sita Wow! Well said! He is smarter than me. He can’t be fooling Savitri Sarkoji. I will block his mind with this Michael Jackson beat. Let’s listen to music. [ Chuckles ] [ Song playing on speaker ] What is this? We listen to Rihanna, Pitbull, Akon, JLo, Justin Bieber and Shakira… Who are they? - They are pop singers. I was fed up with their music. I wanted to listen to some Telugu melodies But it’s the same here. - What? Telugu melodies, huh? They don’t exist anymore. He knows nothing about greatness. You tell him, son "Keep the beat roaring" "No matter what the melody is" "Telugu is sweeter than honey" "Sing it with all your heart and it is joy" "In the anklet of Mother India" "Telugu is the most precious pearl' "In the land where Lord Shiva is worshipped" "Telugu is the ever flowing Ganga on his head" "Being our very essence, Telugu fills every breath of ours" "Reflecting in our lifestyle, Telugu is our pleasant path of life" "Telugu reminds us of home" "Let’s not get carried away by the westerners" "Telugu comes to us by birth" "It is an everlasting relation" "Telugu is the melody of Annamayya’s words" "Telugu is the sparkle in the grace of Kuchipudi" "Telugu is the colorful art of Bapu and Kunche" "Telugu is Lord Rama’s adoration by Tyagayya" "Telugu is Viswanath’s portrayal of beauty" "Telugu is the breathtaking lady of the Nanduri’s" "Telugu is Seshendra’s agony" "Telugu is the shadow of Chalam, Joshua and Sri Sri" "Even the outsiders, Praise Telugu to be great" "Though there are many languages Telugu exceeds them all" "It must be a foreign scent, It must be spilling fragrances" "It’s no greater than motherland."

What happened? - Someone bashed him and left. Hold him, Hold him. - Ok. Open that door. - Sir, Sir... Sir, we can’t get all these bodies into the car. My owner will sue me if there’s blood on the covers We should take him to the hospital urgently to save him Get the vehicle cleaned and covers changed. Learn some humanity if possible. Save him. Hey… You guys go along with him. Take care of him. - Ok brother. Let's go. Sruthi, he looks like an embodiment of humility. You're going to America for sure. I have many ads to shoot in Hyderabad. I'll leave. I will add 50K to what you asked. - Then I'll come with you. Move. I will give you 100 bucks. Hey… Come here. Put the suitcase inside. Greetings. - Greetings. What’s all this blood? What happened? Dad… Actually… Why are you questioning him at the door? Invite him in to the house. Mr. Prasad… My dad... - Greetings. - Greetings. My mom. - Greetings. Please come inside. - Greetings, come in. - Greetings, come in. What happened? Let's go. Actually... - Please come inside. Hey, come here. What happened? Oh no... - I'm very tired. You have travelled for a long time. Do you want to rest for a while? It’s all right, uncle. Let’s be done with the alliance What? Right now? He is right on his part. Sit, dear. I will bring the girl Please sit. Move aside... Savitri, you came right on time. Hello, brother-in-law… [ Chuckles ] Come on, Savitri. We can’t be missing you. - Right. You wait, dear. Give me that tray. Take the bag. I will take care of Sruthi’s alliance. Burger, pizza, sandwich, coke, French fries… What would you like, dear? I don’t want any of that. - Then what do you want? I want all the Indian delicacies. Have you come from Amalapuram or America? Hey Savitri… He always talks crap Me? - Savitri. Sruthi is coming. Calm down. - Come, I have some work with you. Dear… My daughter, Sruthi… I know, uncle. I saw her in the train. He scored a 100 in brilliance too. Yes. A little girl was sitting in a traditional attire in the train. Your daughter reminds me of that little girl. Well said! She seems like a little girl to us too. So, does this come under child marriage? Court wouldn’t approve it, right? Savitri. My son spoke very high of you, Your words, habits and principles. We liked it a lot. If you like our daughter. - Come on. I feel fortunate to become your son-in-law That’s great. That’s really great. Priest. The auspicious timing is at 8 am on Thursday. It brings great fortune to the couple. Wedding in two days? - We want you to be safe. But I will not be happy. Son, the wedding will be in 2 days. Are you fine with it? - I'm fine with it. But I have to ask my parents once. He doesn't have parents, right? Mom, are you happy with me marrying this girl? Ok. Dad, do you agree? Remove your hand. You shouldn’t complain about the little time available. Tell me properly. Are you both fine with it? My parents are fine with it. It’s madness. This is called social physical disorder. What is this? You are getting her married to a crazy fellow. What the hell are you saying, Savitri? It’s not his fault to say that. You all know I don’t have parents. But I think of my parents every time I do something important. I imagine them being right with me and tell me what’s in my heart. They might not be with me But I believe their blessings are always with me. If I caused you any discomfort. Not at all. - Don’t ever think that. When people don’t even bother about parents these days. After seeing a guy like you it makes me really happy. My daughter is really lucky to be your wife. Isn’t it? I didn’t know he was a parents lover. You know it now. Apologize to him. Sorry… He asked me to apologize and I did it. No... I didn't feel bad. Ok. But... But my parents were hurt When you called me crazy. Just apologize to them. How do I apologize to people I can’t see? Though you can’t see them, they can hear you. They will receive your apology. - Receive? They will receive it? Which side is your mom? I am sorry, mom. Dad? Sir, Sorry. Happy? There’s hardly two days left for the wedding. Wedding arrangements have to be grand. Get going everyone. Wedding has been fixed with the American, Wedding is in two days. I thought no one would dare to be her groom after killing the previous one Seems he will go to America immediately after the wedding Raghupathi should not have any celebrations except death in his house. We have to stop that wedding. What will you do, sir? How will you stop the wedding? The wedding arrangements are going on like a country fair What did you say? Wedding arrangements? - Are going like a country fair… That means... If there is fair in town, wedding wouldn’t happen. Pray to the Goddess and announce this all over the town [ Priests chanting ] Isn’t the religious fair supposed to be in next month? That’s what we did last time. Tell them brother. Mr. Veerabhadram will be performing all the duties this time He has tied the holy thread to the Goddess without informing us. Why do we have to stop our sister’s marriage for that? Once the holy knot has been tied, the religious fair cannot be halted. That’s our village custom. It doesn’t stop at that. No auspicious occasions can take place in the village until the fair comes to an end You can have the wedding after three weeks I have no objection to postpone the wedding I am worried about son-in-law’s reaction. - Uncle. when I become a member of your family, I become a part of this village too. We need to honor our customs. And it’s been long since I visited a fair. It’s all right, uncle. I will wait. - That’s good, son. We are leaving. Three weeks time. - Anything might happen. We can prove that he is a bad guy. - Or he might be exposed as a bad guy Anything is good for us. But he has to go back to America alone. If that happens, I will offer 100 coconuts in the name of Goddess Do what ever you want, but give me some money first. Give him. Full cash. I'll speak with Modi about GST. [ Priest chanting prayers ] The specialty of this year’s religious fair is offering their lives to the Goddess. Go and work on that. Veerbhadram is trying to stop this marriage at any cost. Take care of son-in-law. He shouldn’t get to know this. Brother, shall we click a selfie with them? - Yes sure. You're taking selfies with their pictures, But I directly took a picture with them. Hello, come here. Why? - My dad is standing there. Who? This guy? - Don't overact. I'll beat you. Uncle, it looks great. Shall we click another one? - Selfie looks amazing. Let’s go. Shruti Do you know what adds beauty to women? - What else? Makeup… Not at all. you tell us. Vermillion on the forehead and bangles on the hands… I really like bangles. - Is it? Then you wear them. Show me some good bangles. - I don’t like bangles. Sruthi, he wants you to wear them. Do it Why are you supporting him? Sruthi, your brother really likes you a lot. He takes good care of me as I should look after you really well. It's my fortune to find such a brother. All right. Give me. Are we done here? Do they look good? - Yes, really good. Let's go. Brother-in-law, Will you get me ice cream? - Yes. Will you have some too? - Yes. - Do you want it on a cone or a stick? All this is new to you guys. All this seems rubbish to me. You guys go ahead Give me three ice cream sticks. So, it's two. My target missed. What about yours? My target is right on him. - Then finish him. Tastes good. You want to try one more? - Brother-in-law. It’s lunch time. They would be waiting for us at home. Let’s go - Ok. - Let's go. I'm ready. I missed him. These clowns ruined our entire plan. - God saved him this time. I will send him directly to God the next time. How did the fair go? - It went well. Come. Let’s eat. - Come on, son. Come. Father. Yes? - One minute. What is it? Find out if they saw any we faces. Go. [Footsteps approaching] He is coming. Do it. Is this fair, uncle? How long will you blackmail like this? - I will do it However long I please. You will get married and settle in America. It’s a single time settlement I can’t pay you the amount you are demanding. I gave you a lot of money already I agree I made some mistakes in my childhood You did huge mistakes in your childhood. You must have forgotten them. Romance with Needles Sudhakar in the coconut field in the tenth grade… He gifted me a mobile back then, uncle. If he gifts you a mobile, you should shake hands and thank him But not kiss him and provoke him. In the engineering college, You worked out your chemistry with Manthena Diwakar in the physics lab I wanted to cover two subjects in one class. Oh... recently you were kissing Rahul like they do it in english movies. That day I was drunk, uncle. You committed mistakes in a flow. - And I started blackmailing slowly. What have you paid me after all? Just 3 million rupees. Isn’t that enough? It's not enough. Being such a flawed person, if you marry him and flee to America, Who will pay me? So, let’s go for one time settlement. 5 million rupees. - 5 million rupees? I don’t have so much money. - You don't have the money? I will immediately tell him then. Any guy with a conscience would never marry you. Oh no... uncle, I'm begging you Please don’t ruin this marriage. Please uncle. What the hell is this? Have you heard everything? - Yes. I see. First guy in the coconut field, Second guy in the chemistry lab And third guy in the pub… Am I the fourth guy? Very good. You're good at math. Don’t shout and expose her image and ruin my earnings Pack your bags silently and fly off to America. Prasad. Don’t book a flight ticket in a hurry and leave One minute. My house number in America is four. My car number is four. My date of birth is four. It’s a coincidence that my number in your life is also four. The mistakes made at a tender age How can you misunderstand her? With those mistakes... Let's us differentiate between good and bad people. That’s not my worry. All these years he's been blackmailing you, Has been mentally torturing you for money. Your Savitri uncle. He committed a very big crime. If this was America, he would be in prison for 600 years But he can’t threaten you anymore. I recorded everything in my mobile. - What? recording? I will play this to your dad, uncle and brother in a home theatre Home theatre? - Why? Shall I play it in Alankar theatre? The entire village can watch it. Bro, I am pleading you. Please forgive me. I didn’t know your lucky number was four. Not possible. - They kill me if you show them the video. This should be a lesson to every uncle teasing his nephew This family will rip my skin off. - They should. Have you looked at her innocent face? - Her face? She was begging you. Did I ask you to cry? Did I? She over acted, sir. Prasad, you're a true gentleman. But family members would feel bad if they know about it. Let him go. He will face his fate. Please. All right. For safety purpose I am keeping the video with me What about you? - I will shut everything. - That's right. - Thank you bro. Thank god. Pack your bags. You're definitely going to America - I don’t want him. - He won’t leave you. Hello. This is commissioner speaking. - Tell me. While we were investigating at the fair earlier, we found a bullet. It was shot from a high precision rifle. The accuracy range is 900 to 1200 meters. It means, we can shoot our target from a distance of one kilometer. This is definitely a professional killer’s work. Because... There is no one in our State who could handle such rifle. If I guessed it right, murderer is definitely a foreigner Are you giving me information? Or warning me to be alert? Murderer is making sure he doesn’t leave any clue behind They won't get caught. We would have to plan and catch them. You have to show me further development in this case Otherwise, I would have to meet your higher authorities Ok sir. Sir. Whom do you have to meet? - Sir. Which sir? I don’t know his name. But I can recognize him. He saved my life. Tell me properly. - Whom do you have to meet? That guy talking on the phone… It's him. Sir. Hey! Hey! Stop. Some stranger is here. catch him. Don't leave him. hold him. Stop him right there. Do you know him? - Who is he? I am Naresh, sir. Research student from Chennai IIT. Why did you come here? I was lying on the road dieing and sir saved my life Yes, brother. Son-in-law saved this guy. I'm forever in his debt. That is why I want to name my thesis after him I just came to find out his name. That’s all. He would have been almost dead. Do you even know the value of life? Abdul Kalam's life is dedicated to respect the country. NTR's life was about self respect. Mother Teresa's life is the respect of motherhood. Even the driver who takes us home safe also has a life How could you end a life so easily? It's our mistake. I'm so sorry. He is a scientist. Apologize to him everyone [ Goons ] Sorry brother. Sorry brother. Drop our scientist broher in the car. - Ok bro. One minute, son. You are naming your thesis after my son-in-law, right? He is Krishna Prasad. Ok sir. If you don’t mind, you are free to work in our research lab Ok sir. Thanks, uncle. He is doing a bit much. No. He is preceding everyone. I will end this in the coconut fields tomorrow - What will you do? - You will see. We should empty the coconut and pour some vodka in it. - What are you doing, uncle? - This is wine. This Jin and then some Rum. What’s happening now? If you drink one of these, the inner person comes out. If he drinks this cocktail. He will dance. From today, he will be scared to touch even a glass of water - What's this for? - It covers up the smell. - You are great, uncle. - I am always great. Do you want to try? No? Did you like this coconut field? Yes. What’s so special here? I planted all these trees when I was a kid. - Really? - Yes. I should definitely drink few coconuts then You should drink, spill the truth and run from the village. Let’s go. They reached. - Savitri uncle. Is everything ready? - Alcohol is ready. Alcohol? I meant everything is ready to drink. Switch on the camera. Here, take this. It's good have it. They are here on time. Video isn’t necessary. We can catch him LIVE Looks like you guys are enjoying. Have you been around the field? Your sister has shown me the entire field You look really tired. Have this coconut first Drink it. I'm fine. We drink every day. You have it. So you won't drink if I offer you a coconut. That's a big word, give it to me. Uncle, please don’t drink it. Oh... Sruthi, I get it. You want to drink as he is offering it. All right. You offer her, son Drink it. Drink dear. - If you are behaving like this now. Looks like you will totally forget us after your wedding Take it. What are you looking at? Have it. Drink dear. Don't be shy, have it. It’s a body coolant. Have it. They are talking to you. Coconuts up. Coconuts up it seems… Have it. Do you want one more? - No. Brother, there is no fault in our hospitality, right? Not at all. Everything is fine. Let us know if there is any. We will try correcting it Come on sir. - Mr. America. Talk about anything but not the video. Which video? The video you shot on your mobile while Savitri uncle was blackmailing me. She asked us not to reveal it but she is only spilling everything What happened? Nothing. It’s nothing. Why do you say that? The video has it all. - Give me. Looks like tomorrow is going to be death cremation along with the wedding. What is this? - Nothing. She is drunk, don't mind her words. Hey. Inspite of blackmailing my sister, You are accusing her of getting drunk. - Oh no. Mahendra. - Oh no. Why did you hit him like that? - What do you expect? You should hit like this. Oh no. Stop it. I'm begging you. What happened? Enough. he will die. let him go. Oh no... Savitri uncle… I helped you and you got me beaten up. We are no way related to each other now. I will get you married. Do whatever you want can. Sister, do you realize what you are doing? No one can stop your wedding now. I need to talk to you. I don’t like this marriage. What happened? I wanted to fault you at something and have the wedding cancelled. But I couldn’t do it. I agree… You are a very good guy. But a good guy shouldn’t just have good habits. He should also understand the heart of the opposite. You're really selfish in my opinion. You don’t have parents. I have a large family along with my parents. How can I be happy with you, leaving my entire family behind? If you really know the value of parents, Pack your bags and leave by morning. Goodbye. Sister, wake up. We are going to the city for marriage shopping Everyone is ready, You're late. - Damn! I need to sleep. Brother-in-law was in your dreams? In my dreams? He must have escaped with his bags by now. Come, let's check on him. Subbayya, black coffee. - Ok madam. - I want white milk. Add some washing powder to it, everything will come out white. Hey, aren't you ready yet? We are going for shopping freshen up quickly. Why are we shopping for a marriage that's never going to happen? Why does a useless fellow need to drink milk? Hey! Hey! Hey! Cancelling a wedding isn't as easy as cancelling milk. I'll leave only after seeing your wedding. First of all, where's the groom? Did he run away? Put those bags in the car. - Ok madam. [ Women chattering ] This saree? - Which saree? You're awesome, brother-in-law ran away. This wedding is cancelled. What's happening? Where won't leave this place. Time is almost 9'o clock we should be starting by now. Son, we are still getting ready. Just think, this is wedding shopping and six of you. 6 mutiiplied by 5, you need atleast 30 sarees. It takes at least fifteen minutes It will take 8 hours for our selection. - And we need an hour break for lunch. Let's order food to the shopping mall or we're going to waste an hour. In this one hour, we can review our sarees. And change the saree if we don't like it. Or we could order customized designs from their branches. We can't compromise on our favorite sarees. It's not some school or temple that we finish work as soon as possible. It's a clothing store. Isn't it true? - Yes, Yes. Then, let's start. - Let's go. Very good. - Sruthi, you're very lucky. I've never seen a lucky girl like you. Our husbands don't have so much patience. Is this some school or temple? It's a clothing store, make it quick. Sister, are you ready? He is making me very angry You didn't leave inspite of me telling you so much? I thought of leaving... I packed my bags too. My dad told me to leave immediately, While I was putting my charger in the bag, My mom spoke a few words. It's the matter of a girl life, if you leave all of a sudden from wedding. What will happen to her father's prestige? Will she ever find an alliance? What about her sister? Will she get married? She told me to think about your sister too. - Yes, that's true. Isn't it? That's the reason I stayed back. Mom told everything will settle once we have children, I was convinced and put the charger back. I got ready for shopping, I'll see you. [ Screams in anger ] Let's finish our jewellery shopping too. - Ok aunt. Son, I can't see Mahindra's vehicle We are trapped madam. Who are they? They are Veerabhadram's goons, they won't leave without killing us. Tell me. Sir, we found all his ladies and son-in-law at one place. Good job, Doctors should be terrorized while looking at their corpse. I'm going to finish them. You can start celebrating. Why do they want to kill us? Veerabhadram's father did business with us We split up because of some misunderstandings. After a while, Veerabhadram's father died in a car accident. He thinks we did it Since then he's been trying to kill us. I hope atleast by now you understand our situation At least you run away, we are going to die anyways. Do you have Veerabhadram's number? Do you have it? What happened? did you kill everyone including the son-in-law? It's the son-in-law speaking, are you shocked? I know that there is a person like you in every village. But you never knew a person like me would be coming to this village. It's good if you change, you will we alive if you forget. If you still keep doing this. you will die. Hey American! are you threatening me on my turf? Did you think I would sitting with a tie on playing games in a room? Once I shut down the system and start my game. You would be simply watching, there will be nothing left for you to play. If a cheap guy like you is so arrogant, I drink water from the river Godavari, think about the arrogance I should carry.

Only the people with this habit for over 20 years get affected. But Ajay is 20 years old. He must be into some other drugs. Everyone in our gang is used to this tiger brand.

They are from the Anti Tobacco organization you wanted to meet Sir, please go through this report. Very good. This report exposes how dangerous Tiger brand is. Come with me once. They are all people subjected to cancer due to contaminated cigarettes And other forms of tobacco. It’s all a dark business. These brands don’t have Government approval Many organizations like us are fighting against this in India It's increasing day by day but not reducing. Everyone fights to lead a great life They are fighting to die peacefully. Uncle. Passive smoking case, sir. Do you smoke? No dear. Don’t smoke near kids, uncle. It affects us. Even your kids will get cancer like me. I pray to God every day, uncle. What do you pray? I pray that no one gets cancer like me. No one else will be affected. Medical report suggests these contaminated cigarettes lead to cancer. This is the post mortem report of my brother who died smoking it. These two filed a complaint saying they were affected by it Please take an immediate action on the Tiger brand. All the reports are fine. But who does the Tiger brand belong to? Where is this product being manufactured? We don’t even know if an Indian or a foreigner owns it. Whom do we take an action on? On this box? These habits are quite common in people these days. We need a committed system to stop it. We need a committed system to stop it. I will forward it to the Commissioner’s office. Sanjeev, he is right. We need a team to stop it. We are that team. You are on duty even on off days. Problem isn’t just in the border. It's in the country too I am proud of you. Tell me what I can do for you. All the army and retired officers who are on leave Immediately send me their phone numbers, Skype ID’s and email ID’s Sure. I will ask everyone to report to you. But remember one thing. - Sir. You shouldn’t directly involve in such civil matters. Be careful. - Yes sir. What’s the name of this operation anyway Oxygen. All the best. Hello. Hello. What? Nothing. Take it. Thank you. Smile. Thank you. It's okay. Sir… Tiger brand agent… Dealer’s go down… We found the details. But the owner… - No one has his details. We can’t find out who the owner is If you are fine with it… - We can raid - All the go downs - At once. No… The owner might escape if we do so. I will talk to you later - Okay, sir. How do we catch him them? When our enemy knows he has another enemy, He will come searching for us. - Good morning, sir. - Good morning, sir. Come on… Who is it? - What happened? Someone created a Facebook page on our Tiger brand Within one hour of uploading, there have been 1000 likes. Immediately blocked that IP and the page, sir. It would have spread in the whole of India Who uploaded it? They uploaded from a mobile number. Trace out his location if you have the mobile number. Sir, this shows Kompally area. Let’s go. - Move… Move… Where in Kompally? Near St. Joseph’s college… Call that number once. [ Mobile ringing ] [ Distant whistle ] That's my phone. Who uploaded about the Tiger brand on Facebook? That's me. Hey… Who are you? Who are you by the way? - We are its owners. You came running once business went into losses I understood that you are the owners. Do the owners have to wear suits? Hey! Don’t worry. It’s just a quarter alcohol. Listen to me now. I uploaded it. But another guy made me do it. You guys got trapped like a Rat. What do you mean? - [ Chuckles ] You guys didn’t come here. He got you here. Who is he? He is inside. You guys are dead. [ Doors open ] Who are you? Indian Army. Adult role model of youth. Why did you poke our business instead of securing the borders? You aren’t into some service for me to stay calm. It’s a mistake. I will not spare anyone that does a mistake Come on… Get in… Get in… Fast. You can do anything to us.

Why are you in a hurry? if you stand here any longer I will start crying. You have waited for three years. Can’t you wait for 6 months more? I was strong because you would come back.

We are from an NGO Did you file a case against Tiger brand? - Yes. You did a great job. We have come to appreciate you. They shouldn’t know about Sanjeev at any cost GIta talk to me. How are you doing? - I'm good. We are taking Gita home. - All right. Uncle. They shouldn’t see uncle. Come inside and sit. Sit. Hey! [ Doorbell rings ] What’s the delay? I got a call from the lab. it's urgent I have to go. You guys start. I'll be right behind you. Ok, Make it fast. - Ok. Leave… This is the right time. Leave now. Do you have to go someplace urgently? Neighbor uncle asked me if I would go to temple with them. I said I am busy. Would you like some coffee or tea? No, dear. You know, I can’t believe you did all this by yourself. Is there someone helping you? I'm an orphan. I have no one. I only did all this. [ Doorbell ringing ] I forgot my glasses. Aunty is waiting downstairs. Go fast. Who are they? Forgot your glasses? Who are you anyways? This is my house and your asking who am I? Who are you people? - You say it’s your house. What about the girl? My daughter-in-law. - Uncle. Wait… You tell me… What about your son? - He is out of town. He isn’t coming anytime soon. Even if something happens to you He won't come? Who are these people? How do we look, huh? Uncle. Uncle. No! He will come now, right? Dear… Dear… Leave me. I filed the case on you. They are innocent. Please let them go. Do we believe that you did all this? Tell me. Who all are behind you? Just like we found your address, we will find his and kill him. But if you tell us where he is, we will leave you. Tell me. who is he? Sentiment, huh? Don't. Say my name. Mom, Say my name. You killed my son. You made my daughter a widow. You are talking about sentiments, huh? Aunty. Dear... let go... Dear... Tell me. Who is he? He did it for the country. I will not tell you. Gita. Run away. You will die unnecessarily. Tell me who he is No, No, No. Hey… Go after her. - Go kill her. Go. You guys also go. Gas bro. - Stop her. - Catch her. - Stop her. Stop her. Hey that's gas. The guy you are looking for is coming. Once he is here, none of you would live. I want to see you once, Sanjeev. Come on. They said people trade lives for love. But my Gita really gave her life. We took your people’s car number from Gita’s apartment security Your uncle got to know we are inquiring at the RTO office. That is why we killed him. His death caused fear in all your family. So, they stopped going out of the place. But to kill them, I sent all the details to your dad through uncle’s mobile And entered your house as the groom. Now tell me. My brother, who dreamt of succeeding like Abdul Kalam? Is it wrong to kill your people, who took lives of many It's not your mistake. it’s my mistake to be born in this home. But my dad is a nice man. We will tell him everything and seek his support. Your dad cannot solve this problem. Our eyes are only on the target during war. My target isn’t the formula Or someone’s support. I need the cigarette’s formula that is making the coming generations its slave If I kill your family and leave the formula, it will go into someone else’s hands If I go the legal way, they will produce another brand illegally. I am not a common man to seek revenge for my family’s death. I'm a commander. The entire country is my family. This explains the war. Account details related to our business are kept safe by uncle in a go down. You might find details regarding that formula there. Where is the go-down? 20 kilometers away from our town. Your suspicion was right. He is the watchman here. Four people came and left. - Tell me. Three men and one woman came. - Where are they? They just left in a black car. - Let's go. Stop. stop. Have you seen a black car pass this way? It just went this way. Go. Stop here. Stop here. Use helmet. - Ok sir. - Thanks. Bring big vehicle next time. What is it? Do you know the places I've looking for you? Why? - Why? Don’t you know how to treat your guest? He is tensed over there. You have been roaming jobless in the car. Sruthi is also not around to give me pocket money My wallet is empty. It’s been four days since I drank It’s been 10 hours since I posted on Facebook. Balance in the mobile is only one rupee.

I was right by him and he didn’t give me a single penny. Looks like he distributed the money already Where are the 50 billion rupees? Ticket... ticket... Bro, 5K was deposited in my account. I don’t know who did it. - It must be a fake message. Even I got 5K transferred through PayPal I got 5K from Western Union. Super! Someone deposited 5K on Money gram. It isn’t unusual of Kohli to hit a six. But someone transferring money is new. Son, have a look at this message. I don’t get it. Someone deposited 5K in your account. My house owner warned to throw my stuff out. I will throw this money on his face. My dad doesn’t even give me pocket money. But some stranger deposited 5K for me. It is yet unknown who deposited the money and why. To enquire about the money transfer, Enforcement Department has handed over the case to CBI Sir, Enforcement has handed over the case to you. How are you going to deal it? Will you catch the money depositors or not? We will catch them. We will find out who deposited the money and why If it's illegal money or anything... We'll find it out in two hours. Two hours. Have they gone crazy? Instead of catching the ones robbing money, They are after people distributing money They can't find them. Hello. Tell me, Suresh. Hello sir. Sir. Like you said, They have a warehouse in a private compound behind the chemical factory. No one is allowed there. If you go, you might find the formula. Find out what’s happening inside. But be careful. Ok? Ok sir. Attention. Attention everybody. - Good morning sir. We got a call from Home Security. 5 million people all over India were distributed 50 billion. It has all been operated from our State. How could they deposit money to so many people? Sasidhar. - Sir. I immediately need all the details. - Ok sir. The way we gather data for marketing purposes They must have done it in that way How could they do it without any ID proof? They must have done it through someone’s account. Come on… Check it. - Yes sir. 2000 IDs have been used totally, sir. - 2000 people? Catch everyone. Don’t spare anyone. Show me your ID. Is it original? If you get any information, tell me immediately. Sir, we can’t catch a single one of them Why is that? - All of them are dead. How? Due to cancer. Ok. This transfer was made using the dead people’s IDs But how is that possible? Move. Sir, he gave the voter list copy of everyone in the city Sir, I would have done it for 1000 bucks. They paid me 500k Who? I don’t know him, sir. He called and deposited 500K in my account and I mailed him the list Which number did he call from? This number sir. Satellite phone. Sashi. - Sir? - Go through it. - Ok sir. It’s hard, sir. This satellite number is in the army network Army? Sashi. - Sir. Talk to the defense secretary Take the permission immediately. - Ok sir. Thank you. Sir, Permission granted. Sir, it shows the Rajahmundry area. Book flight tickets to Rajahmundry. - Sir. Alert the local team. Keep that phone under continuous monitoring. I will catch him today. Move. Sir, the location is shown at Devi Mall. Suresh, found anything? Sir, I came to repair the server in that private compound. Your doubt was correct, sir. Computerized illegal cigarette production is happening here. Through a main server Cigarette filling, packing and production is automatically taking place The whole system has to be crashed to stop the production Yes sir. But the firewall protection is really strong here. Overriding is not possible, sir. Share me your location. I am coming right away. Ok sir. It shows 100 meters. - Hello, sir. Come on… Sanju... cops are here. Sir, even the satellite signal is cut. Shit. He is smart. He is somewhere around. Round up every corner. No one should go out. Come on. Move... - Move. What? Cops are in the mall. What to do now? Sir, your phone is ringing. Hello. Welcome to Rajahmundry. - Who is this? Who are you? The common man you are looking for. I know you are not a common man but an army man. To destroy Indian economy. I also know you joined hands with foreign countries and distributed the money How much is your commission in that? Tell me... 43.5k given by government on India. Not to destroy the nation but to protect it. Why don’t you tell us if it’s such a good act? Sorry, sir. Military secret. You know it can’t be leaked. Whatever it is, I will catch you. Whom will you catch, sir? The one passing by in the red shirt? Catch him. What happened, sir? Or the self executive walking out of the shop? Your brain speed and training isn’t sufficient to catch me. I will only surrender in 4 hours. Stop. stop. If you don’t surrender right away, I would have to use my weapons. Understand? What, sir? Encounter? Will you use the guns we use back on us? You need permission to shoot. I don’t even need it. I'm challenging you to get out of this mall. I have left that place long back. See you soon. He is playing with us. What the hell is going on here? - Excuse me. You said the formula would come running if we take the money Looks like we will be caught before we find the formula. Now we know the location of formula. Send the second message. 'India in youth’s hands...' 'To know why I sent you the money,' 'Open this video link at 10 in the night.' He sent money to all of us. Get a big screen for the entire hostel to watch India in youth’s hands… What’s this video going to be? Everyone is discussing the same. Is that video going to shake India? What do you say, sir? - Nothing, dear. It’s a publicity stunt for money. It must be some dirty video. - No. He is definitely trying to send a message to the youth Recharge for Internet on this phone. Why do you need internet on phone? - I want to see the person who sent me money. It’s not possible on your phone. I will show in mine. - Ok. Excuse me, sir. Phone from Home Secratray. Tell me sir. He sent a video link in another message. We have to stop that at any cost. It’s hard, sir. We can’t remove it unless the link is activated What if his message translates before we stop it? We can’t do anything, sir. It will reach the public. So, you want me to watch the video too? You have to, sir. Sruthi. Will you help me? What is it? I will transmit live video through this at 10pm. You should upload the link. No matter what happens inside, the video shouldn’t stop. It must reach the public. Will you do that for me? Promise me. Thank you. Sanjeev. I was string when you were beside me I am scared that you are leaving. Back then, I was strong that you would come. Now, I am scared that you are leaving. I have many friends like them in military too. A bullet suddenly hits you in the war. One of us dies right in front. That second, I am happy that I am saved but not that I will live forever. I know the next bullet is for me. I know I will die. But the reason for dying is important. Bye. Sruthi. Tell me, Sanjeev. - Connect me to Suresh. Ok. Suresh. - Tell me sir. I am at the north phase compound. One second sir. I'm switching off the power for 3 minutes. You can come in, sir Ok. Suresh, We are in. I fixed all the cameras like you said. They will switch on right at 10pm. - Ok good. Hello. Ya Amith. - All set. Ready to go. - OK, Carry on. Suresh. Suresh. Come on the line. Suresh, where are you? Suresh. Suresh. Suresh. Suresh. Suresh. What happened, Sanjeev? Suresh. Suresh. - Suresh. Satya. Satya. Satya. Satya. Hey. Do you think only you can kill? You messed with us by killing our people. Shouldn’t we repay you? Jai Hind. Amit. Amit. Amit. Jai Hind. Amit. How many people will you kill? How many? You show off as big shots but is this tainted cigarettes business what you do? Court has banned it but you have released a new brand with the same formula. Tell me... where is the formula? Tell me where the formula is. Tell me… Tell me. Tell me where the formula is. Sanjeev. Father. Let's move. Move. What are you staring at? This is my original get up. This is my original profession. When everyone in your house is a rogue, I can’t expect you to be good. But your daughter thinks you are really great. What makes me a rogue? I'm a successful businessman. Have I pleaded people to smoke cigarette? They are smoking and dying. What do you want me to do? Every business has a strategy. Every product is publicized to the extremes to attract audience. I didn’t even do that. These people follow the herd. Their hope to enjoy life is more than their hope to live. They are spoiling their life to get high for a minute. I'm making cash from it. Is it wrong? There’s nothing wrong in doing business. But for your earnings, you have mixed a formula in your tainted cigarettes to make them addicts. That’s wrong. That’s resulting in cancer and killing many innocents like my brother Personal revenge, huh? I thought you are serving the public. You want the formula, right? It isn’t someplace else. It’s right here. Even if the entire factory is on fire, I'll make a cigar with the same combination and introduce in the market again. People would come running for it. I would have killed you long back. But if I kill you, there will be another. If he dies and another. I shouldn’t just kill you people But people’s weakness too. That's why... I've waited this long You saw it, right? His real character. Change at least now. We are dying at the border for you people Our sacrifice has a meaning. Your death doesn’t have a meaning. Many of you are useful for the country. But you are just looking for that high. You guys are dying for one minute kick Please come out of it. If you don’t want to change, come to the border with me Let’s die together. Your death will have a meaning then. Who are you talking to? You have told the people everything yourself. You told the people. But your mistake here is... Said the formula was in your head. Mom Ok? Dad, ok? Hey! Are you ready? Jai Hind Ok sir. Sir, Police Commissioner’s call from Vizag Sanjeev’s dead body wasn’t found at the spot You will not find it. Search team assures to find it within 24 hours Even 24 years wouldn’t be enough. We are all working for the paycheck. But he is working for the country. And, disconnect the phone. Look for another case. Ok sir. Hello. I didn’t expect a call from a dead man. According to the records, you are dead. But this nation needs your service. A person like you should live. Any time… Any day… Call me… This Indian is there for you. Thank you, sir. There is a lot more I have to do. Every step of mine is for my nation.
