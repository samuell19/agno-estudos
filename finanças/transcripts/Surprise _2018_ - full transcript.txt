Erm? Can we try. Just smile with your eyes. Okay. Just smile with your eyes That's better. Oh that's better. Huhh.. Tacete! Canes! What? Shut up! You fuckin dogs! You speak Latin? Only when it’s convenient, apparently And you thought now to be that time? A dead language. Reflecting what? Your career? Your anxiety? Humour me. They say you only die twice. Once when your body fails and twice when your names spoken to for the last time And in what order will that benefit you? You have aspirations on what you want to accomplish in this life. Correct? So why is it? That this shoot is dramatically put on hold because you cannot keep your tongue pressed firmly against those teeth? Well your photographer... One takes a picture of a rose, regardless of the equipment or the skill behind it. It is still a rose. Correct? I’m sorry if I’ve insulted you in some way. I just wanted some... direction. professionalism... Direction? Professionalism? Mannequin? Do you know what a mannequin is? Yeah. Mannequin does not talk, you see, a mannequin is a blank canvas that one can showcase clothing You are here to sell the items you are wearing, not what is underneath them. It doesn’t matter who we get, the clothing sells itself. A mannequin is for display purposes only, you bring as much to this shoot as a fucking clothes-horse. You stop to ask for direction? Can I ask you a question real quick? Am I telling you how to do your job, or are you telling me how to do mine? Because we’re not doing the latter ON MY FUCKING TIME!!! Here take one for the road. Now get the fuck out of my studio. Do i know you? It's possible we met once before. But. as you've no recolletion. Then collectively.. no. Well you obviously didn’t leave a good enough impression did you. We never do. Come around. I knew you’d be here What would you do if I wasn’t? Wait, you’d come eventually I didn’t want to be alone tonight But you are. Let's begin Don't shut it out. Let it in. Let if feed on your darkest thoughts, and desires. Your hatred. It is bound to you, as you are to it. Come let it out. Let it breath yes ..having to entertain these fucking models your sending me. Amateurs all thinking they’re going to be the next Cara... They'll only be good enough for toilet selfies when i'm done with them. Gumtree! You insult me with Gumtree! calling themselfs freelancers They haven't even got the decency to come through a proper agency. I don't give a fuck who they advertise themselfs as. It's just Craigslist without the STI. I know I know just being facetious Yep Yep I got the delivery. Yep. Fucking Yank. Tacete! The last your name will be spoken. Byron. A warm welcome ladies and gentlemen to The Old Familiar. For a very special evening. My names Archie. I'm your announcer and your Bouncer You can heckel but i'll kick your teeth in. Hello. Hello sweetheart. Hello Shania. I've shagged her. Let herself go a little bit. Haven't we all? And now without further ado Sorry i missed this one. Each writer is going to come up display his talents for you. Please. Show your appreciation to them. We'll get on with the evening. So...HAPPY HALLOWEEN!! What you doing man? What was that? (laughing) Relax. Are screams not the soundtrack of halloween? The very ambience of this evening? They are merely gunshots to bonfire night. The sounds that dwell in familiarity of darkness.
