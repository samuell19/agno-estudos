It's ready, right? Yes, yes. It's ready. Right? Okay... Wait! Ground Level News will keep an eye on the whole process. We will keep you informed about the truth that the late actress wanted to reveal, as well as the whole process of the trial. We'll be back after the hearing. Go and get more images. Way to go! Here's the media expert. Oh, look who's here. The editor-in-chief of the Hankook Daily newspaper. So your last broadcast got 300,000 views? Come on. It's 400,000. Wow. How about getting a cup of coffee with me? Why should I? This again? I may be useful for your reinstatement. So now you publicly admit that your company was responsible for my wrongful dismissal? No, I just mean, my company may put in a good word for you. It's good for you too. You should be back in the broadcasting world. I'm still in it! It must cost a fortune to wear this decent suit. Go work your ass off. I'm leaving. Jang-ho! Are you gonna be okay? No, I'm scared to death! Where's my pill? I mean. It's the president of the Hankook Daily. You're pushing yourself too hard. You're dealing with the biggest newspaper company in Korea. If this goes wrong, it can damage your reputation. Investigate charges and put the guilty behind bars. That's what the Prosecution is for. Right? Come in. Oh, it's you. You two must be working on some strategy for the hearing. Shall I leave you two alone? - No. - No. please sit here. Excuse me, then. It's the first hearing. Quite a fuss out there. My pill--- You're unbelievable. Quite a nerve to indict President Hyeon. If things go right, you'll get some attention. I won't. But she will. Seriously? Defendant Choi Cheol-soo, a filmmaker, on May 14, 2012, at a bar named 'Inferno', put his hands under Jeong Ji-hee's shirt, touched her breasts and also ran his hands over her panties. Thus he is charged with committing sexual assault. - Prosecutor? - Yes? Are you okay? No, I'm actually terrified to- Yes, I'm fine. The Prosecution may proceed. What's with her? It's her first trial ever. Defendant Cha Jeong-hyeok, CEO of Kovest Entertainment, on June 7, 2012, at the bar 'Inferno', threatened Jeong Ji-hee, and I quote, "Serve him well or I'll kill you" and beat her head several times. He forced her to attend the party against her will. Thus he is charged with coercion. Here comes the big guy. Defendant Hyeon Seong-bong, CEO and President of the Hankook Daily, on June 7, 2012, at the bar 'Inferno', attended the party where Jeong Ji-hee served him against her will. The defendant was aware of that and took advantage of her. So he is charged with aiding and abetting of coercion. Thank you, prosecutor. The Defense, please make your opening statements. Regarding the party the Prosecution mentioned, it was defendant Cha Jeong-hyeok who hosted the party to thank defendant Choi Cheol-soo for casting Jeong Ji-hee in his movie "Goodbye My Love". People were singing and dancing. While partying, the defendant accidentally touched part of her body with his hands. He had no intention of sexual harassment. Defendant Cha didn't force the victim using any means of threats or assault. As an agent of his actress, he gave her a few words of discipline. Counsel Yoon? Yes, your honor. First, my deepest condolences to the deceased. Defendant Hyeon Seong-bong has served as CEO and President of the Hankook Daily, one of the biggest newspapers in Korea. Over the last 30 years, he has devoted his life to fight for the people's right to know. How can they even call themselves a newspaper! Silence! Proceed. My client admits that he attended the party. But it's doubtful his attendance justifies his charges. Your honor, I believe you will make a sound judgment. Here he comes! Do you have anything to say? Please look at the camera! - Do you admit to receiving sex bribes? - Get him outta here! Now! - Do you admit to receiving sex bribes? - Get him out! Do you admit to receiving sex bribes? You've become a prosecutor, just like your father. I'm so proud of you. How's your work? You didn't want ask to see me for this chit-chat, didn't you? You're right. Mi-hyun. About President Hyeon. Just drop the charges. You've humiliated him enough already. You know we're not supposed to meet outside the court and discuss the case. We both know. You can't win this case. We have evidence, the surveillance footage. You should deal with that first and then try to talk me down. The evidence can be something or nothing. It's you who can make something nothing or vice versa. That's the power you've got. Do you really think people will think that surveillance evidence is nothing? It's not them who's in court. It's us. You can't just ignore what others think. Don't you get it? Just one stupid actress. What's the big deal? How did you get this document? After the funeral, I received it by mail. Who sent it to you? Well, the name and the address was fake. So I don't know who it was from. What did you do after you received it? I double-checked if the email address belonged to Cha Jeong-hyeok, went to the bar where they threw a party, then interviewed the owner lady and checked the surveillance footage. So I confirmed the information was true. That night, you reported the news on your TV show "Reporter's Notes"? Yes. Your honor, I offer into evidence a copy of the email correspondence that the deceased sent to defendant Cha before her death. It is received in evidence. Mr. Cha. You're an evil man. Last time, I put up with all the nasty things that director Choi did to me and I even had to fall do the casting couch to get the part in his movie. The Prosecution didn't file a charge of sex bribery, correct? No, your honor. And you call yourself a prosecutor? Order in the court. And you saw it too last night... what Mr. Hyeon did to me. You said, if I quit, you wouldn't let me work in this business again. Well, bring it on. I wrote down every name that I served so far. If you don't let me go, I'll go to the police with my diary. Where is this diary? We couldn't find it. You may cross-examine, counsel. You have been sued for defamation by the defendants in this court. Correct? Yes, it's a civil action. Aren't you defending your clients for that case too? Witness. Answer only yes or no. Yes. I gather that lawsuit is to give grounds for this one. Rephrase your answer? You want to question my credibility for this case. It's not suitable for criminal action, so you go with a civil case. - Witness! - Witness. Let the court do the judgment. Counsel, proceed. Witness, how many lawsuits have been filed against you? I think that's irrelevant to this case. Objection, your honor. Relevance. I'm asking about the credibility of the witness. Overruled. The witness must answer. 34 in total. I lost none of them. You lost the case in relation to the report about corruption in the National Tax Service. I was charged with contempt for referring to them as tax-fed pigs. The court partially ruled for the plaintiff. But you said you never lost a case. The judge ordered to the prosecutors to change the charges and I paid the fine. But the report turned out true so the civil officials all got disciplinary action. Your honor. The witness has been dismissed from TV station he worked for. That was a wrongful dismissal. I'm fighting that in court. I guess we're done here. Do you have further questions? No, your honor. No. Witness, you may leave the witness box. - ls witness Go Da-ryeong present? - No, she isn't. Order in the court. Do you still want her to testify as your witness? Go Da-ryeong is an A-list actress that the defendant represented. And she was at the party with Defendant Hyeon. I'll make her present for the next hearing. Okay. Counsel. Will your client will be present for the next hearing? Yes, I'll make sure he will. Hello. How's Mirin? How's Mirin? Mirin? Do you even care? Come on. Not again. You promised. You promised to keep a low profile until the court ruling. Now you're working for some internet news site? And why did you bring my nephew into your mess? I'm falling out with my sister because of you! You mean Jintae? He's doing great. Yeah, right. Living apart is bad enough already. You're being so selfish. No more excuses. Come over here. Have you thought about our daughter? Okay, I'll think it over. What's more to think? If you keep doing this, I want divorce. - This is not a marriage. - Hello? Honey? - Are we even a family? - You're breaking up. I'll call you later. - Don't you dare hang up on me! - I'll call you back. Uncle. We've got company. It's been following us since we left Seoul. Who are they? What the- Look at you, catching fish instead of criminals. The fish aren't coming. If you don't want to help, don't mess it up at least. Have you been catching a lot? - You know, Jeong Ji-hee's diary- - Where's the camera? Over there. Way over there. It's too far. We can't even recognize you. What's all this? ls Jin with you? Both of you need to talk to me at once. Why is one of you here and the other there? I'm not that crazy enough to come along with that brat. Where is it? The diary. You came to the wrong person! Go to the prosecutor in charge! You are the second-in-command. You should know everything. Come on! You're scaring them away! It wasn't our decision. The prosecutor insisted to indict Mr. Hyeon. Really? And the Hankook Daily just stood by? You know her father. You can't ignore the power of a Supreme Court judge. Do you want me to comb every corner of the evidence room? Just tell me where her diary is. Police closed the case as a suicide. No crime scene preservation. No laboratory investigation. Plus, no autopsy. Then you meddled in after the funeral. So we reopened the investigation. Who knows who took the diary, man! How about the sex bribery charge? You got the evidence, right? Stop messing up my fishing! Hey! The girl's already dead. No one would own up to banging her! You know how things work. Okay. Okay. Guess I have to work on another story then. Your brother lost out to the nominee. I got to see him. If I don't get promoted this time, I have to quit my job. I'm off now. You know that guy Cha Jeong-hyeok. He was charged with a similar case 3 years ago. Back then, he ran off abroad until the dust settled. That's why he was arrested this time. Cha Jeong-hyeok used to call his actresses to his parties. Is that right? He did on a daily basis. Every day some girl had their duty call. But did they have to? The more people you know, the more jobs you get. You can't say no to the chance to meet producers or directors. So... if you get to meet them, do they ask you for certain favors? Like sexual ones? So you're curious about that too? A few days ago, another reporter asked the same thing. Do I have to answer that question? Well, don't you think it's time to tell the truth? Time has passed and you're no longer in that business. It can be helpful for young girls who want to be in the business. Why do I have to tell my story for them? Even if I do, would it change their minds? I don't think so. My life sucks but I've never lost my pride. I'm done here. I trust that you'll edit the interview wisely. Don't forget to censor out my face and alter my voice. After all these years, I'll be on TV. But I can't tell my mom, can I? On May 14, 2012, defendant Cha Jeong-hyeok and defendant Choi Cheol-soo came to your bar 'Inferno', correct? Yes, director Choi was about to shoot his new film. So he came after meeting with the actors. ♪ Don't have feelings for me anymore ♪ ♪ Don't look for me again ♪ ♪ Because I will break your heart ♪ Damn it. Director, you shouldn't do that here. My hands must be too cold. She's freaked out. You're so mean, director. No, it was totally accidental while dancing. It was before Choi Cheol-soo casted Go Da-ryeong as the female lead, correct? I don't know. Witness. On the preliminary examination, you said you heard that the defendant asked Go to be in the leading role and Jeong to be supporting role. Did I say that? I really can't remember. When you play the music, the light changes in that room. Right? Yes, it gets darker. You said that you turned your face when you heard the scream. Under the dim light, there must have been a time gap. Did you clearly see that his hands were under the panties of the deceased? Well... His hands accidentally touched the body of the deceased. That made her panic and overreact? Objection, your honor. That's a leading question. Sustained. Another question. Next question. After she came back from bathroom, how did she feel? Objection. He's asking the witness about victim's feelings. I rephrase the question. After that, what was the atmosphere like? Objection, the question calls for an irrelevant answer. The deceased didn't leave the room after what happened. So we can speculate about her feelings based on what the atmosphere was like. Overruled. Proceed, counsel. I'll ask again. After that incident, what was the atmosphere like? Well, it was okay. It seemed she thought Choi did it to her because he was drunk. No further questions. It's funny. When I was a prosecutor, I used to drink boilermakers to save time. But even after I became a lawyer, I still can't live without it. So, about this case, what do you think? Nothing much to say about my clients but I feel sorry for Mr. Hyeon. Feel sorry for him? His charges don't make sense in the first place. The public makes judgements about what they think about the law. Back in old days, it was okay to turn a blind eye and keep a low profile until the media forgot about us but now it doesn't work like that at all. Social media crap and all. Everybody talks all the time. As you know, it's an open-and-shut case. Your clients. The trial damaged their reputation already. But we must not hurt my client's. Not even a scratch. You do your best only when you have to. Understand? You're not going to be a lawyer forever, are you? You worked as a fashion stylist at defendant Cha's Kovest Entertainment? Yes. On May 17, 2012, you accompanied Jeong Ji-hee to a photo studio for her profile photo. Yes. You heard Jeong Ji-hee say, I quote Director Choi is just like the other bastards. Objection. The question is leading the witness to convey a third-party opinion about my client. Sustained. On May 26, 2012, you and Jeong Ji-hee were at the sets of defendant Choi's film. The sex scene wasn't in the script! I told you already. There were some changes in the script. Wonjae's wasted and rapes Da-ryeong's friend, which amplifies a conflict between two main characters. Don't you get it? But that doesn't make sense. You had no discussion beforehand, and you suddenly make her do this now? Hey! Director... Who should I talk to? Mr. Cha? Damn, how annoying. Hey, Mr. Cha. Listen. We changed a little bit of story. We want Ji-hee to do the sex scene. Why? Did you just ask why? God damn it! 'Cause it's necessary! I'll put her on. Here. Take the phone! Why is it so damn hard to make a movie? Yes, hello? But this is too much. That was her last day on the set. The rest of her part was canceled. She was really hurt by that. She felt used. Let me ask you one last question. Did she ever tell you about any casting couch or sex bribe? We were just work friends. We weren't that close. Especially for such a shameful thing for a girl. I guess you're right. Okay. We're done. Thank you for today. By the way. She called me early in the morning that day. After helping Da-ryeong's shoot, I went back home and fell asleep. I was exhausted and so I couldn't hear the phone ring. If I took that phone call... I feel so terrible. Director Choi thought Ji-hee as a yes girl and that she would get naked easily. I took her home and left. But I realized I forgot my car keys so I went back. Why are you back? I forgot the car keys. Didn't you hear the doorbell? No, I was distracted. What? Hey... It's not what you think. Don't. Stop it. Spit it out. Now. Spit it out. Why didn't you tell me last time? You didn't ask. Did you tell Mr. Cha about this? No. She didn't let me. You should've told him. Taking care of her personal life was part of your job. Can you leave? What's the point of telling him? She ended her life as a last resort to get away from Mr. Cha. Him and the big shots who harassed her. All those demons are still alive. You know who those demons are? No. I don't. I gotta go now. Okay. Ah, well... Wait. One last question. You were the first person who found her dead. Did you see her diary? No, I didn't. Okay. Take care, bye. Thanks. Will you just stop? Why would I? It's only getting fun now. Find the dead bitch's diary. What's the point? Watch your mouth, man. We couldn't find it, neither could the prosecutor. What makes you think you can? If I did, it wouldn't it be great? Don't you think? They'd be wetting their pants. It would make no difference. You'd just get into trouble. I don't want anything. It's the only way to make your boss flinch a little. Just a friendly advice. Hands off the case. Think about your wife and your kid in the Philippines. Now you're going too far. Is that a threat? Here you go. Enjoy your meal! You've changed. Changed a lot. Stop talking nonsense, you dick. Okay. Where are you going? You'll keep following me, right? You're buying. Hey, Jang-ho! Bottoms up. Play fair. Okay? Long time no see, Jin-seok. Go away. Don't make me say it again. - Wait. - Fuck off! What's this? Erase everything on the camera! Jin-seok. Calm down. I live out in the boondocks because of you. You should be ashamed of yourself. Get the fuck out of my sight. Keeping it a secret won't do any good to your dead sister. - Damn it. - Oh my god. Are you okay? Why are you hitting him? - My eye. My eye. - Your eye? Sorry about that. Let's call it even. You made me press charges against them. Why did you close down your Chinese restaurant? After I sued them, I was getting more calls for interviews than meal orders. You gave up just like that? I started to have hallucinations mocking me saying my sister sold herself to the big shots. I couldn't stand it. So I sold my restaurant. Ji-hee came here about a week before she died. Right? That's so little for her. There's nothing much to eat. Poor mommy, how undutiful we are. If you're not gonna do the preparations, don't complain. You should get yourself a wife. Huh? Then why don't you set me up on a date with a girl? You don't ever look in the mirror, do you? Next time I should order the food for her memorial service. No need. I'll see to it. Yeah, right. Hey, should I quit my job? Why? Having a rough time? No... I guess I'm a bit exhausted lately. Every time a young actress commits suicide, the media will talk about my sister. Now that they will, we should at least clear her name. I want you to write her last story. Don't worry about me. I'm on my own now. I've got nothing to lose. From April to June 2012, you worked as an escort girl at 'Inferno'. Yes. On June 7, 2012, you served the defendants Cha Jeong-hyeok and Hyeon Seong-bong at the party. Yes. That day, Hyeon came first. Correct? Yes. It was just past 10:00pm. I went into the room and there were Mr. Hyeon and my manager. And Mr. Cha came about half an hour later. Was he alone? Good evening, sir. No, he was with a girl. She is a new girl that I'm representing. I was newbie back then. I thought she must be one of the girls like me. Later, I learned that she was actress Jeong Ji-hee. How was the atmosphere that day? Oh, it was horrible. I've never been to such a weird party. That girl didn't say a word. Oh, what should I call her? The dead actress? You can call her the victim. Appreciate your taking time for us. It's truly an honor. Oh, thanks. We have so many girls as talented as Da-ryeong. How to put it... Arrogant isn't the right word. She seemed to be pouty. Let me fill up your drink. Objection. The witness is speculating other's feeling. How long were you there with them? Hmm... about 30 minutes. I felt so suffocated so I couldn't be there anymore. So I left pretending to go to the ladies' room. You just said that you were with defendant Hyeon for half an hour before defendant Cha and Jeong Ji-hee entered the room. Yes. Did defendant Hyeon ever mention that he asked Cha to bring an actress? No. Then, did you hear defendant Hyeon call defendant Cha to bring an actress? No. No further questions. Then, did you hear anything defendant Hyeon talk defendant Cha out of it or ask Jeong Ji-hee why she was there? Your honor. The argument of the Prosecution is far fetched. According to the witness, the party was for my client to meet defendant Cha and it was defendant Cha who brought the deceased. Defendant Hyeon was fully aware the fact that Jeong Ji-hee was forced to join them and yet he didn't do anything about it. Even so, the Prosecution can't even prove the charge of coercion against defendant Cha. According to the witness, it is certain that the victim joined the party against her will. Okay! The court has heard enough. Both of you calm down. Are there any further questions? - No, your honor. - No, your honor. Witness, you may leave the witness box. Counsel, you may call your witness. Yes, your honor. I solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. From October 2011 to June 2012, you worked for the defendant's company Kovest Entertainment, correct? Yes. What was your job title at that time? Road Manager. Around 19:00 on June 7, 2012, the defendant wanted to see you in his office, correct? Yes. When you entered his office, what was he doing? He was on the phone talking to Ji-hee. What did he tell her? To get herself prepared to meet someone important. Did the defendant threaten her or swear at her? No, he didn't. Why did he want to see you? I don't know. Who picked her up? Mr. Cha did. Normally, don't you pick her up for her officially scheduled meetings? Yes. Which means that was not an official meeting. I don't know. When you were at the questioning, you said that the victim came to the office and argued with defendant Cha. For how long do I have to support Da-ryeong? It's totally up to you. You practice acting hard and- I've been doing everything you told me to. Even that... Watch your mouth. The walls are thin. Let me go. What? Where do you want to go? I want to start all over. You do? Let me review the contract. Oh no. I have it in my head. You have to pay me penalty fees for breach of contract 30 times plus expenses. I believe your money already went down the drain. Your one and only brother runs a Chinese restaurant in the boondocks. I can't believe you'd do this to me. The easy way or the hard way. You choose. "Please have a heart" or "See you in court". It seemed like Ji-hee wanted her contract to be terminated. Objection. Speculation. No further questions. Witness, you may leave the witness box. Do we have the next witness? No, your honor. Do you still want Go Da-ryeong to testify? She's abroad at the moment. But she'll be back soon. We can't for wait her forever. At the next hearing, just cross-examine the defendants and make your closing statements. Are we in agreement? Your honor, I would like to send the subpoena one more time. First get a hold of her, then we can talk about it. Wait, wait. You don't want to win this case? What are you talking about? The game's almost over. Time to use your ace up your sleeve. That's enough. I don't want to lose either. But I cannot reach Go Da-ryeong. How did you reach her before? Through her mother. You're being so naive. You should've let your colleague take the case if it's so difficult. - Are you done? - Okay. Did you find the diary yet? I'm working on it. Well, how did you find out about that? That's the only thing what you reporters are after. Don't tell me what to do, and just mind your own business. Normally at your age, people don't get beat up. Oh this? I let him hit me. On purpose. I don't beat strangers. Are you even listening to me? To be fair, Da-ryeong is a victim too. After what happened, my daughter suffered a lot. She didn't even eat or sleep. I'm not happy with the media saying to the public that my daughter took advantage of that dead girl for fame and that she did the casting couch. You know, she was A-list actress before she signed with that agency. Your daughter is being called as a witness in court. I said, she's a victim too. She had to get therapy for what happened. She left the country because the media never leave her alone. So she won't appear in court? It's up to her. Every time the subpoena was delivered, I let her know. She said she understood, but never said when she would be back. The prosecutors said it's not easy to contact her through you. Did they? That's strange. As far as I know, they contact her directly. Over the last 10 years, I've worked with top stars and earned a good reputation in the business. I've never pressured anyone to do anything against their will. When you sign with the agency, you think it's only a matter of time before you're a star. But then you don't get any jobs for 6 months. You were cocky at first, but you start to learn how to be humble. I'll work hard. Please get me anything. After you first do the parties, you get a job, even if it's a teeny, tiny one. It's a trap. You know, girls like you are a dime a dozen. There's nothing free in this world. Got it? I just had a drink with the actors. What's so wrong with that? I'm in front of the court. The scandalous trial of the Jeong Ji-hee case has now entered its final stretch. Last week, we promised that we would reveal the story behind her tragic death. She had attempted suicide once before she died. And prosecutors are being complacent in the preparation of the trial. Let's find out more. Let's go. Okay. Let's go. Damn it. All the hard drives are gone. This drink isn't enough to make up for what you've been doing. We'll call it even when I hit you. - Come here. - What's up with you? You really don't know? You bastard! The world changes in whichever way. There's nothing to brag about what you did. I'm leaving. I was expecting your news report today. Are you putting it out tomorrow? Pull yourself together. Give us the news ASAP! I thought Thursday was Ground Level News day? That lazy reporter deserves a good punishing. Yes, honey. What are you doing? Just looking for jobs. Did you find anything? Not really. Should I do tutoring again? You're not a friendly teacher you know. Who's gonna hire an old man that has a big face and smells like cigarettes? How did you know about that? Are you following me on Twitter? I have my own sources. Ah, Jin-tae told you. Well, what are you gonna do? Well today's just... OMG. OMG? What are you, 20? How's our girl doing? Sleeping. She seems to be tired of waiting for you. She wants to go back to Korea. If anything happens, call me. We'll go back. Okay. Sleep tight. I request to reopen the proceedings for Go Da-ryeong to testify in court. We only have one hearing before the sentence is passed. And this witness has refused to appear in court several times. The Prosecution's request is intentionally delaying the trial. The witness will be back in time for the next proceeding. I spoke to her on the phone. What do you reckon, counsel Yoon? I agree with counsel Kim. If the counsels refuse my request, I'll have to issue an arrest warrant to Mr. Hyeon. The defendant has never been present in court after the first hearing. But the case is almost over- Okay. Request granted. But if the witness fails to appear, the court will pass the sentences and close the case. - Do you agree? - Yes. Back then, there were many girls doing really well. I just tagged along with them. You know what time it is? - You said to take some time off. - You can take as much time off as you need after you die. We've got nothing. What are you going to do now? We have an ace up our sleeve. Huh? You'll know it when you see it. She ended her life as a last resort to get away from Mr. Cha. Him and the big shots who harassed her. All those demons are still alive. ...to get away from Mr. Cha. Him and the big shots who harassed her. All those demons are still alive. Where is it? The diary. She called me four days before she died. She wanted to give me a tip-off about her unfair contract. At that time, I was in the Philippines to see my wife and daughter. So I asked her to call me back next week and she said okay. When I was back the next week, she was already dead. I had completely forgot about her phone call. Now you know who my source was. Yes. It was her. I thought, if I had met her right after she called me, would she have ended her life? I feel responsible for her death. I mean it. Nothing changes if you keep your mouth shut. Just like there's nothing but mold in the shades. I call Go Da-ryeong to the witness box. Go Da-ryeong? She came! Before proceeding with the witness examination, considering the relationship between the witness and the defendant, the court judges that the witness should not testify with any undue pressure that may come from presence of the defendant. Hence the court orders the defendant to leave the court temporarily. At around 11:00pm on June 7, 2012, did you go to a bar named 'Inferno'? Yes. Who asked you to come? It was Mr. Cha. When he called you in, what were you doing? I was with my friends. Suddenly he called me saying that President Hyeon wanted to see me. He said President Hyeon is very important. He said, "You're very important to our company. Come over now or I'll be doomed." So I had to. When you entered the room, how was the atmosphere? Oh, Miss Go. Nice to see you. I really loved your recent TV drama. Da-ryeong, come in here. I pestered him so I could see you. She's the most precious asset of my company. Pleasure to meet you, sir. Have a drink. Which one do you want? I get easily drunk. Yes, she is a light drinker. Let's say... that's the only fly in the ointment. Mr. Hyeon. My name is Jeong Ji-hee. My name is Jeong Ji-hee. - I'm 25- - What are you doing? My name is Jeong Ji-hee. I'll be a good actress. And... What else happened? A while later, Mr. Hyeon left the room. You bitch. You crazy bitch. Do you have any idea who you're messing with? I've worked my ass off to meet him. And you fucked it up! Stop it! Get the hell off of me! So I'm not good enough? I'm not Da-ryeong. I'm just me. Am I really not that worthy? Don't you get the picture yet? Da-ryeong is here now. And you're putting a damper on it. Don't butt in! And I just spread my legs for him? Damn it. Please stop! Ji-hee, are you okay? Serve him well, or I'll kill you. And then? He's high on dope. We just watch and enjoy. Your success comes from girls like her hoping to be like you one day. Is it painful? Difficult to watch? It ends soon. She sows your success and you reap it. If I took the courage to stop him, she wouldn't have ended up like this. I was scared. That I couldn't work in the business any more. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Her testimony is irrelevant to the charges. Your honor! In order to get defendant Hyeon Seong-bong on the witness stand, the Prosecution requests an arrest warrant for him. Against the defendants Hyeon Seong-bong and Cha Jeong-hyeok, the Prosecution will add the charges of sexual coercion. That's great news! - It's not possible to amend the charges! - It's against the defendant's rights! - The request of the Prosecution is not worthy of consideration! - Please make the audience silent! - Your honor! Your honor! Order! Order in court! Mr. Lee. I owe her an apology. I was scared. I couldn't stop her death. I thought I could be there for her. But it turns out there were things I didn't know. I was scared of Mr. Cha. And I didn't want her to be disgraced after her death. I'm not sure if I'm doing the right thing. If I'm wrong, I'll ask for her forgiveness when I see her in heaven. Hello, everyone. This is Lee Jang-ho from Ground Level News. You're watching us live on the internet. We have an exclusive on Jeong Ji-hee's death. What I'm holding here is the late actress' diary. She wrote down every detail about what she had to go through. Noteworthy events date to December 2011. She wrote that the CEO of her talent agency, Cha Jeong-hyeok, forced her to serve at his parties. She also had to perform sexual favors. Names mentioned in her diary span media figures, producers, politicians, prosecutors, and bank officials. Do you remember my name? I said, do you remember my name? You got some nerve to talk to me like that. Why should I? At least my dick will remember you. And if it remembers you, I'll come and see you again. My name is Jeong Ji-hee. The number you dialed is not available... You good for nothing. Never let your guard down in this country. You have to kick the crap out of those bastards. Anything you want to say, counsel? I apologize for having caused you trouble, sir. You can't even handle this stupid prosecutor? Is it because her father is a Supreme Court judge? How long do I have to put up with this humiliation? She's nothing but a bitch. Korean prosecutors are not that easy to deal with. You paid me a fortune. You have to trust me and let me do my job. Now if you'll excuse me, I'll go clean up the mess. By the way, you never asked me if I slept with that bitch. It's not important to me at all. I don't even have to know. I'm just helping you get what you want. Come in. Come and sit here. What brings you here? I have something to say regarding this case. As you know, your honor, her father and I have known each other for many years. We went to law school together, we passed the bar exam together, and we served as prosecutors together. He's a very close friend, I must say. So I've known prosecutor Kim Mi-hyeon for a long time. Once, she had measles, and I filled in for her father. I think it was about 20 years ago. One day, her father asked me to have a drink. He was drinking like a fish. Normally he didn't. I asked him what was wrong. He said his daughter had been violated. In his own house by his nephew. I really feel sorry for her. Maybe that's why she's obsessed with this case. Are you okay? Prosecutor Kim! What I'm asking is for you to take her off this case. I heard what you said. I had no idea. I didn't know she had experienced such a terrible incident. - Excuse me. - I understand. But you have to think about your father. If the word gets out, it's not good for your father. Do what he says. Excuse me, but... have you ever been compelled to bring the evildoers to justice by any means? Have you ever had a case like that? I want to win this case no matter what. Counsel, are you afraid? I wouldn't have even started this if I wanted to back off now. The counsel's statement doesn't have anything to do with the case. I won't resign from this case. Ji-hee I see her in my dream. - Dear! What is it? Mom! Oh no, Ji-hee!... It's going to be difficult to get them. Your testimony is all we have. But we have to try. You should leave the country for a while. That's the only way I can protect you. Nobody gave a damn before. Now everyone's here. They're all hyenas looking for a scoop. All rise. Please be seated. Who is it? Who is it? Sorry. Officer, get him out of the court. Please stand up. From now on, anyone who interferes with the trial will thrown out of the court immediately. The judge is acting weird today. Before we start, the court will consider the amendment of the charges. The relevant request from the Prosecution is applied only when the charges are in line with the previous ones. Considering the precedent cases, the court must consider the relevancy as well as the range of the penalty. Also, it must be taken into consideration the effort, time, and cost the defendants need to construct their defense. I don't understand a word he's saying. The amendment of the charges exercises an unfavorable influence on the right of the defendant. Hence, the Prosecution's request is not approved. Your honor. I request reconsideration. I've already given you an explanation. Make it at another case. Your honor! We will proceed the examination of defendant Hyeon Seong-bong. Defendant, please proceed to the witness box. Prosecutor! Prosecutor! On June 7, 2012, did you have a drink with the defendant Cha Jeong-hyeok and the victim Jeong Ji-hee? Yes. Did you ask Cha to bring Jeong Ji-hee? No. Were you aware that she was forced to be there? No. Are you aware of the testimony of Go Da-ryeong? Yes. What do you think of her testimony? I swear to God, I don't know anything about that. Over the last three decades, my company has been my life-long commitment. I have always tried to live up to my high standards of ethics and trust. This is a snapshot from the surveillance video at the entrance of 'Inferno'. Is the man in this picture you? Yes. And another picture here. That is you as well, correct? Ten minutes later, you were holding a briefcase. What was in that briefcase? Prosecutor. What are you trying to prove? I'm asking what his briefcase contained. How does is it relevant to the charges? I have more questions to ask. So then answer me. How are your questions relevant to the charges? Why are you interrupting her? Officer. Get him out of the court. Order in the court! The evidence of the Prosecution is not accepted. - Proceed to the another question. - Your honor. Are you denying my authority? No further questions? Then the counsel will proceed the cross-examination. You may cross-examine, counsel. I haven't finished yet. Please allow me to offer another piece of evidence. Objection, your honor. The relevant evidence wasn't discussed with the Defense. And it is not clear what the Prosecution wants to prove. To prove the charges made against the defendant. Please read the marked page. June 7, 2012. 10:41 pm. President Hyeon Seong-bong. 'Inferno', Seong-nam. I met with Da-ryeong and Mr. Cha. Your honor! Turn off the monitor. Now! Prosecutor! Order! Order in the court! Or leave the courtroom! We're adjourned. You honor, I'm not finished yet! The questioning is not finished! Try the best you can. For you, we didn't reveal the last page on TV. I did a good job, didn't I? And, so did you. I'm not finished yet! I'm not finished yet! The court is prepared to proceed to sentencing. Before the sentence is imposed, please note that this sentence only applies to the charges given to the defendants. The court makes it clear that the sentence is not relating to the high-profile reinvestigation of the sex bribes. The court finds the defendants Cha Jeong-hyeok and Choi Cheol-soo guilty as charged. The courts sentences each of the defendants to one year in prison and two years of probation. And the court finds defendant Hyeon Sung-bong not guilty.
