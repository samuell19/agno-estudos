Saberi. Nitu is on her way. Will you wait here? Where are you going? To get more sweets. Come on! The event hasn't even started yet. -A little more won't hurt. -Alright! So, are you really not going to give a speech? Yeah. I'm not really the best public speaker. Without both of us on stage… the college reunion speeches… will be so dull. The reunion needs you. How's your mom? She's fine. Why does your dad always cast you in his movies? Why not? Okay… I can tell him to cast you in the next one. Happy? No, don't bother. My dad will hire a director to make my film. Blossom will flourish tomorrow morning -I am hopeful -I am hopeful Go to the country of Red Hills -You are completely a misfit here -You are completely a misfit here You are a weirdo here You are completely a misfit here Listen. Don't you understand? I don't understand anything, Saberi. Oh, really? -Yes. -Then, let me explain. Your heroine is eager to make things right… but you must try hard, make an effort. So, send an SMS asking her… to spend some quality time together, and to go for a long walk together. Alright? -Instead, I can tell her directly. -No. There is a huge difference between saying things in person and sending an SMS. Mr. Javed Hasan… I don't want you and your heroine at the villa tomorrow. Is that clear? Your wish is my command! Thank you! That's why, I don't go out. I can't dress right. Nothing ever matches. Finally, I got it! This one. Look, this is your matching blouse! This one? Does this shade of red match? I was thinking of another shade of red. Mom, it does match. It will look great. I never wanted to go. I want you to go. Wear this. -Will this match? -Yes. -You'll look beautiful. -Really? Yes, really. And what about the earrings? Of course, I'll get them. These kinds of places bring us closer to ourselves. It's much better here, right? Far away from the city. Am I right? Don't you feel like we've become functionaries? As if, we've been appointed as husband and wife. When did our life become such a drab art house movie? Maya! Is that a nickname? It's a part of her full name. Okay. Age? Seventeen years old. But you'd said she graduated her high school. Yes, because my daughter was admitted to school at a young age. Oh. -When did she leave your house? -How would I know that? When I woke up, she was gone. Had I known, I wouldn't have called you. Why are you so sure that she has eloped with Javed? Who is her dad? Is it you or I, sir? I know whom she would elope with! Oh, okay. -It's a matter of love. -No, it's not! He wants my property, so he's kidnapped her. Note it down as a kidnapping case! Tell me something about the boy. His name is Javed Hasan. He's from Syedpur. Age? He could be 35 or even 40. No. He's probably around 27-28. Shut up! If it were up to you, you'd say he's 25! I'd told you not to hire a male tutor for our daughter, but you didn't listen! This has happened because of you! What is the boy's address? Where does he live in Dhaka? I don't know. You can ask my wife. Oh! Ma'am! If you don't give us any information about the boy, how are we supposed to rescue your daughter? He completed his higher education from Dhaka University. His younger brother studies in Jagannath College. After completing his higher education, now, he makes art films and things like that. Oh. Film director! Didn't you just say he's a private tutor? Do you think these short films help him make money? No! That's why, he makes a living by offering private tuition! Oh. Who is Mr. Wasim? My boss. Oh, okay. So, where is your boss? Mr. Wasim! What happened? They are looking for you. Why? What happened? What's your name? Wasim Khan. You are the one I'm looking for. Why? Who are you? Why are you looking for me? -Excuse me! Where are you taking me? -Come with us. We're your brothers-in-law. -Let's go! -Why aren't you saying anything? -Keep walking! -Where are we going? -Sir. -Let's go! -Sir! -Come! If you don't want us to find your daughter… then we won't be able to find her at all. What do you mean? Look, sir! I have received the PPM award for investigation. You have seen how efficiently my team has executed this investigation. We have found everything. Stuff like, from where they rented the bridal dress… where the wedding took place, from which studio they took their photos… we've found out everything. If that's the case, why haven't you arrested the boy yet? That's what I am trying to tell you. If we want, we can arrest him in 20 minutes. Then, what are you waiting for? Where are they? At your wife's place. Your wife knew their location all along. Listen, Mr. Shawkat. This is a matter of kinship. We can bring them to court if you want… and the two families can fight and throw mud at each other. But if you don't want this, there is another solution. Please, come here. Who is this gentleman? Javed's father. When my angry father-in-law was looking for us in the whole world, we were enjoying our honeymoon in your mom's store room. Do you remember? Here! How impossibly beautiful… how impossibly beautiful and uncertain our life has been! That orange telephone… the rented bridal dress. Have your soup carefully. Don't spill it on the kurta. Seriously… those were the days. Those were the best days of my life. Why do you continuously talk about the past? Why are you always reminiscing? It seems like you feel… we have no present. Like everything is over. -There are so many flies here. -Yeah! -They'll lay eggs in your tea. -Throw it out. Throw it out. I wanted to share something with you. Something my father taught me before he died. Do you know when people die? People die when they become irrelevant to the world… or when the world becomes irrelevant to them. That's why, I used to do this… I used to visit my father every day to discuss some concoctive issue. But I never concluded it. I always used to say, "We'll discuss the rest tomorrow." That way, I gave my father a reason to live one more day. That's how, I kept his death away. Eventually, I got busy with my film career. I hardly visited him anymore. I was afraid his words might come true… that he would die from irrelevance. And he did. My father helped me believe… that God allows people to die… when they lose communication with their loved ones. DEBUTANTE NITU QUITS JAVED HASAN'S FILM FAMILY SCANDAL BREWS Hey, where is my tea? Hey! Kohinoor? Maya! Maya! Hello. Greetings, Mom. Greetings. -Is Maya at your place? -Yes. She came this morning. Could you please give her the phone? Her cell phone is switched off. Yeah, okay. Hold on. Yeah. It's Javed. Do you want to talk to him? What did you say to the press? What? From where they got this information that we've developed a friendship? What friendship do I have with you? Why did you tell all this nonsense to the reporters? Mom? -Greetings. -Greetings. -Sorry for all the trouble and shame. -Please, sit down. She's in her room. Go, see her. Okay. Why did you leave without saying a word? You have a girlfriend! What? That's causing me trouble at home! Tell me, is this supposed to be easy for me? What are you saying? They've never written such things about you before! Then, why now? There's nothing like that! And that too, your daughter's friend! What do you want me to say? Hello. Mr. Editor. What didn't I do for you and your newspaper! I took you to the minister's residence to solve your problem. I was with you when you were in deep trouble! Now, is this the way you pay me back? Is this the way you say, "thank you"? I'm sure you told your reporter to write absolute lies against me and my family! God bless you! I will see you. Hello, Auntie. Greetings. Greetings. My teacher wants to talk to you. -Okay. -Just a moment. Greetings, ma'am. -Greetings. -Yeah, so… I'm new at this school. -Oh, okay. -Yes. I'm a big fan of your husband. Ma'am, today is the qualifying round for the interschool talent competition. Your daughter and Nitu are the finalists, but your daughter isn't here yet. But why are you calling me from another student's phone? Sorry, ma'am. I should have called you from the school phone. Sorry about that. What's up? Mom, why are you just sitting around? What am I supposed to do? Everyone tends to me. This is your house. You'll be running it in a few weeks. Go and start instructing everyone! Tell them I want faux wall panels in the kitchen. Go and tell them. Okay. Dad! Dad! Mom wants faux wall panels in the kitchen. If there was nothing going on between you and Nitu, then why did you save her number as "121"? What are you talking about? You saved her number as "121" in your cell phone. -Where's your phone? -It's in the car. -Let's get it. -Alright. -Come. -Sure. What if I threaten them? What if I tell them I want to go to a boarding school? You think that will make them stop fighting? Why do you keep digging this issue? Forget this chapter! How can I forget it? Did you stop seeing Nitu? It is really frustrating, Maya. I don't talk to Nitu. I don't work with her either. I don't even know if I would make this movie at all. But I was happy thinking that at least, this chapter is closed. But you keep bringing this issue up! As if, this girl is standing firmly between us. How is it my fault? It's really frustrating! Here's the key. I need some rest. Hey! -Can I get an autograph, please? -Are you free? I need to go to Gazipur. Can you do it? What? Driving. You're out of practice. I can take care of it. So, you and Ahir can sit in the back. It's okay. You were happy to surrender the driver's seat completely. But you forgot that it might be necessary… to drive yourself one day. DHAKA METRO-G 27-0195 Greetings. Brother Aynal, where is Mr. Javed? Miss Nitu has sent him this lunch box. -Greetings. -Greetings. -How are you? -I'm fine, sir. Thank you. Brother Aynal, have lunch with him. Put it there. Hello. How long are you going to stay at the production housing? Maya, give me some time. I think, you also need some time. Everything will be fine, I think. Time will heal. It will heal everything. As you wish. -Take your time. -Bye. What are you doing here so late? In your last film, you'd written a scene where the girl shows up like this. Does this scare you in real life? Do you have a cigarette? Tell me? Do you really want it? You'll have to share it. What? You'll have to share it. Fine. -Another one? -What? It is my crime. I should leave. Ahir. Ahir! Wake up, honey! It's Eid today. Saberi will visit us with her family. -No, Nitu. You guys should visit us first. -Okay. We'll visit you after you visit us. Okay. Alas! If I could do it, if I could do it I used to stand there Touching your fingers Everything looks unstable and distraught What is that barrier? Why are we playing peekaboo? What's the reason for this dusk? What kind of monsoons… I have to continue to bear? What a life! Is this even a life? Is it like a buoyant lotus Floating on water? What a life! Is this even a life? Is it like a buoyant lotus Floating on water? What a life! Is this even a life? Is it like a buoyant lotus Floating on water? What a life! Is this even a life?

I don't need anyone! -But-- -I am tired. -Listen to-- -I am tired of this life! I won't leave just because you've told me to. You're in this condition because of me! You have a gastric problem! -What about your food-- -I don't have a problem! And thank you for being caring, Nitu. Thank you very much. -Now, go! -Please open the door! -Go! -Open the door, please. Go! Please open the door! Go! Error at the cornice and untimely Indian Medlar flower Stay in touch on the either side Stay in touch with the urban breeze Stay in touch to be a neon sky Days of mango pine are passing through Just like a resemblance of shadow Now, I feel no pain Despite the agony accumulating Days of mango pine are passing through Just like a resemblance of shadow Now, I feel no pain Despite the agony accumulating What a life!

She's an attention-grabbing poor lady! She finally realized that she can beat me at everything, but she cannot grab your attention! She can never be your daughter! Marrying you was her only way to win! But what were you thinking? Mom won't hide in shame! We will face the world boldly, while you rot! I hope, someday, you will understand that. Do you know something? I'm not coming back! I'll never set foot in this house! I came today only to tell you one thing! As of today, you will never hear from your son and daughter again! You will rot here alone! It will be your punishment. Is that a blessing or your revenge? Tell me! For the rest of my life, I will be in love with the man… who will be crying over another girl! A girl who hates me like hell! Do I really deserve this? Saberi! Saberi! What? Will you come downstairs? Why? I'm going out. So, what should I do? Choose a dress for me. Start doing that on your own. Be smart. You have such bad taste! Does this color go with my house? I didn't choose this. The other ma'am… -chose this. -I don't want to hear about her. -She selected that… -This house is mine! -design. -This house belongs to me, right? -You will follow what I say! -Yes. I know, but I was just saying that… -she selected this design. -I don't want to hear any excuses! I want the rugs and the curtains changed. I want everything changed. Please! -Brother, please do negotiate. -Hey! You know her. Give us your lowest price. It'd be 250 taka per kilo. It's a special price just for ma'am. No, that's too much. -It's fresh. -It's too expensive. -It's okay. Give me two kilos. -Okay. -Yes, give me two kilos. -Ma'am, I'm going inside. -Alright. -Two kilos. Right, ma'am? How much is the eel? It's for 500 taka. It's a special price for you, ma'am. Okay, give me some. -How much do you want? -One kilo. -One kilo? -Yes. One kilo, but with a discount. Okay, ma'am. Your prices are too high. -My fish are the best. -It's too expensive. Lower the price. -I'll buy more. -No. Sorry, ma'am. What are you doing here? You know ma'am is here. You shouldn't have come. Hey, how long will it take to get a cup of tea for sir? Get it immediately! Get some biscuits, as well. -Sufian. -Yes, sir? -Give this to Saberi. -Sure, sir. I'm on the other side. Come when you're done. Yes, sir. Have a good day. Sir, can I get an autograph? -Not now. -Please, sir. -Not now. -It's just an autograph. -Not now. -Please, sir. Alright. Jhalmuri! Jhalmuri, anyone? Jhalmuri! Sir, Miss Saberi refused the package. Reza, wait a minute. I forgot my charger. Please, fetch it for me. Yes, ma'am. I'll be right back. How could you do that, Javed? Tell me! I gave up everything to marry you! Did I do it for this? Excellent! My audience and I have waited only for this. We've waited for this interview, and for your TV appearance. We want to hear more from you. We want to learn more. But first, let's take a viewer's phone call. Hello, caller. Tell us your name and ask your question. Hello, my name is Musafir. -I'm a big fan of Javed Hasan. -Thank you. My question is… can't he understand that the girl he's seeing is only after fame, and that she wants to ruin his name in the media? Why were they even invited to this program? To teach indecent Western lifestyle to our nation? It's totally indecent! -Disconnect the call. -What will we learn… -from them? -Disconnect the call. -Are we supposed to-- -Come on, disconnect the call! Maybe, it's better if we don't take any more callers. Look, I'm happy. I've been a filmmaker, but now, I've been promoted… to a national teacher. I have so many things to teach you, my dear. You can learn various things from me, like how I brush my teeth… how I take bath in my bathroom. Is that what the nation wants? To learn such things? So, please come to my house… and I'll tell you what all I can teach to this nation. How are we supposed to just sit here like this? Boss will not spare you! You just sat there like this big statue! Although, you won't feel it that much. Did you use to take pills for arthritis? Just sit there! Let's see how long he can sit like this. Let the boss come. Boss will deal with him. Hey, boss is coming! Hey! Hey… come here! Boss. Boss, I respect you more than my own father. I've come from Chittagong to learn filmmaking. Boss, you're kicking me out today, so I will leave. But before that, may I know what my crime is? Come here. Sit. Log in to your Facebook account. Click on your profile picture. What is this? Boss, I respect you a lot, so I'm using my picture with you as a profile picture. -Sorry, boss. -You respect me… but disrespect my wife? Where did we take this picture? Where is the original picture? Show me. Are you showing your respect by cropping my wife out? Is it because of the fear that people would make fun of you? Tell me. Shameful! Get out. Miss, ma'am is occupied with an extra class. She won't be long. -Fine. -Have a seat. -You can sit inside. -Oh. Thank you. But why? What would I even do there? Ashulia has a lot of trees. Trees give lots of oxygen. -It will be beneficial for you. -I don't want to go. You don't have any choice. I don't want to hear any excuses. Happy birthday to you -Happy birthday to you -Happy birthday to you -Happy birthday, dear Mom! -Happy birthday, dear Mom! -Happy birthday to you -Happy birthday to you Have some cake! I'm too old for this. Old? What's old? You're still our little girl. Hey, do you want some? You don't say "no" to anything. You two are very emotional. I'm leaving. Okay, no more tears. Ahir, give me the cake! -Let him be. -Ahir! -Let him be. -He'll eat it all! So, is this your Ashulia? Yes, ma'am! Here's a tissue to wipe your chin. -Where is it? -Here. -How did that happen? -I don't know. -Now, what? -Hold on, wait. -Where did you go? -It's just that… I'm a bit embarrassed. Why? It's easier to say bad things to people… instead of the good things. It's hard to praise them, as we feel shy. So, I came here to tell you a few good things. What's this all about? You'll know soon. Let me finish the drama first. Mom, I behaved very badly with you over the past few months. I hurt you by saying whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted. I called you, "spineless" among many other things… which you didn't deserve at all. Today, I have something else to say. You're the most beautiful woman in the world. Ever since you stopped waiting for someone to tell you what to do, you've become the most beautiful woman in the world. Ever since you decided not to give in to self-pity… to become a lieutenant and march forward boldly, you've become the most beautiful woman in the world. Ever since you started to see yourself as an individual… you've become the most beautiful woman in the world, Mom. And… we are proud of you. Are you done? All done. Then, come back. Thanks. Mom. I love you. I love you too. Mom, let's sell the car. Why? You shouldn't work for others. Sell the car. Start your own coaching center. Hello. Hello. Hello, who is this? Why aren't you talking? Look, I have nothing to say. And I'm sure you also don't have anything to say to this bad father. I will never get to hear you call me "Dad" again… so say anything you want. Am I right? I want to hear your voice. Say something, anything. What? Who is it? Hello. Hello. Ahir? How are you, son? I heard you're skipping school. Can you do one thing? Tell your classmates that… you hate your dad and he's a bad guy. Declare this once and for all. Then, they'll stop teasing. If you'd protest when they say that I'm a bad guy… it'd encourage them. Can you come a little closer? Sir, Miss Saberi said she would never accept this. Put it there. Ready for meal? I made fish curry. Is something wrong? -You know what-- -I arrived a bit late. -Oh, okay. -Stay here, watch everything. -I'm going downstairs. -Alright. -Keep an eye on things, okay? -Yes, sure. There are too many people here! Shubho, go upstairs! -Take them upstairs. -Everyone, go upstairs! Hello. We'll depart from here in an hour. Hello. Yes? Oh, okay. How? Ahir, wake up. Ahir! Wake up! I have something to tell you. Your father passed away this morning. Mom, I don't like poached eggs every morning. Tomorrow, please, make an onion and mushroom omelet. Ma'am, here's the three-months work plan. Mom, should I pick you up at the office? I can come by after my classes. What happened? What's wrong? Where is this water coming from? Saberi! Saberi! Sister-in-law! Saberi! Saberi! Uncle! -Greetings, Uncle! -Greetings! What were you doing? -I was just praying, Uncle. -Oh. The stairs are flooded. Oh! I didn't notice. There was water in the bucket, and the bucked fell. -I'll wipe it. Go on. -Okay. What happened? Nothing, it's just that Saberi wasn't opening the door. Oh, okay. Can you come down for a bit? Yes, go ahead. Look, legally… Nitu is Javed's wife. Nitu wants to take the body… from the morgue to her flat. Whoever wants to pay their respects… must go there. Don't you see why she's doing this? It's simple. She knows that my mother will never be able to go there. Do you want to go? To see him one last time? Has the place of burial been decided? I made an official request for the national graveyard… so that everyone could go there. But Nitu wants… him to be buried at the Nayantara Film City. She says it was Javed's last wish. I just saw her interview. She didn't mention this in the interview. She made that up in the last two hours. That's fine. My father didn't only divorce my mother… but he also divorced his two children. He has no past, no memories. He divorced everything. Javed Hasan was born at the age of 50. He came to the earth when he was 50 years old, and met a girl named Nitu. They married and gave birth to a child. The end. But what can we do? We have to make a decision. There is no time. You really don't understand, do you? Why is she doing this? She has competed against me all her life! She is still competing! Can you please make a comment… on the lack of communication between you and your father? This isn't the time, please! -Our viewers want to know. -We don't want to comment, please! Share with us some memories of your father. Please! Thank you! When I first heard of your death, I was somewhat happy. Yes, I was actually happy. I'm happy because you're no longer in her custody. Now, I can close my eyes and see you in my mind. Death returns love, respect and honor. Respected, devotees! On behalf of the departed and his family, his brother would like to say something to all of you. Greetings! As you all know… that my elder brother… Mr. Javed Hasan, has passed away. If he had hurt you… or others in any way… I request you to forgive him. Can you please forgive him? -Yes, we forgive him. -Yes, we forgive him. Please, let the members of the family come close… and spend some time with him, one last time. Please, make way for them! Nitu, let Saberi spend some time first. Then, you can see him off. Please! Dad! Can you hear me, Dad? I'm your daughter. Can you hear me, Dad? You'd told me that you wanted me to call you "Dad." I'm calling you, Dad. Dad! Dad! Can you hear me? Dad, I'm sorry. I love you.
