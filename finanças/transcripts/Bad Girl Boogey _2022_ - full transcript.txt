(thunder rumbling) (ominous music) - Lovely. - Yeah, it still smells like old man in here. - Smells like stale piss and cabbages. - Fucking shut the fuck up, yeah? Can someone draw a pentagram, just here? Fucking now. - Well what colour do you want? - Fucking white. - Okay, well thank you. (ominous music) - That's a star of David. - What? - The Jewish star. - Whatever. - Here. (ominous music continues) - Kelly, Kelly. - Mm-hm? - Here, salt. Can you pour it in a circle, please? - [Kelly] And what the fuck's the salt for? - Just fucking do it, yeah? - It's supposed to protect us from the demon. - How? - I don't know. Maybe demons and snails are related. - Right, and you actually believe that this will work? - Fuck no. - Well. (ominous music) Well, I've got a question, those of you that are in attendance. That Old Man, Boc? - [Blair] Boche. - That one. Was he in here doing like, black missiles- - Black masses. - And like sacrificing babies and shit? (Blair scoffs) - I think the only thing he was sacrificing in here was his liver. - Right. Well, I've ran out of salt, Ash, so what do you wanna do? - Hm? - I've ran out of salt. - Fucking spread it. Spread the fucking salt. - Come on, it'd be too thin if I did that. - Then go fucking find salt in the fucking other room! - I'll go. - Thank you. - Good. - I wanna have a sticky beak, anyway. (ominous music) Creepy. - Blair! For fuck's sakes, Blair. Is there salt or not? (Ash mumbling) - [Kelly] Aye, it's fine. What the fuck are you wearing? - Thank you. - Thank you. Okay. (ominous music continues) - All right, I gotta take a piss. (ominous music continues) Where's the fucking mouse? For fuck's sakes. Oh, fuck, fuck! - What? What is it, what is it? - The fucking mouse is gone! Fuck's sake. Fuck. It was fucking you, wasn't it? You fucking did this. I'll fucking smash your fucking face in, do you under-fucking-stand? You never fucking believed and you're a pussy fucking cunt- - Hey, hey, hey. - You let the fucking mouse out. No! Fuck this shit, okay? What the fuck are you even wearing? You look like a fucking fairy. (flesh squelching) (Ash thuds) - What the fuck did you just do? (dramatic music) (flesh slicing) (Kelly choking) (blood spurting) (eerie music) (weapon thuds) (Blair sobbing) - Get it off. (dramatic music) (Blair sobbing) (insects buzzing) - Fuck, you're creepy. (ominous music) - [Dr. Sherri] How are we doing, Oskar? Oskar? - We have a purely shrink to psycho relationship, doc. In fact, I think it's quite unprofessional of you to suggest otherwise. I'll have to alert the authorities. Can't imagine what your husband would think. - Give it a miss, Oskar. This is exactly the kind of behaviour that keeps you coming here week after week. - I'm here because they punched a Greek bastard's teeth out. - You really think that's it? - Uh-huh. These brain shrinking sessions keep me out of lock up. - Oskar, your family's wealth and influence kept you out of lockup. Plus any idiot with a body full of teenage hormones and a cultural predilection for puerile xenophobia can punch his schoolmate. But you're not any idiot. In fact, according to your records, you're an exceptionally intelligent young man. Up until the last year and a half, you were getting top grades. You showed great potential. Look, when we're not here to deal with your violent episodes, but whatever it is that makes you feel the need to do them, when you're clearly not the meat head you're playing right now... - You don't know me as well as you think. - Maybe. - I know something about you. (ominous music) Something I bet your colleagues don't know. Something I know your husband doesn't know. - That's enough for today. - I saw you on Friday night. Holding hands with some chick. Going into that dyke bar, what's it called? The Kaboom Bar. - You're clearly not in the right mind for this session today, okay, so can you please leave? - Dr. Sherri- - See you next week, Oskar. - I don't know why that- - Listen to me. My personal life is none of your concern and has nothing to do with my treatment of you. - I'm sorry, I- - And if you ever threaten me again, I can and will have you locked up. Now please leave. Leave. (Dr. Sherri sighs) (tense music) (lighter clicking) (ominous music) - Oh, ah, ah! (ominous music continues) (flesh shucking) (dramatic music) (people chattering) - [Receptionist] One of those days, huh? - Can you tell? - You've got the panda eyes. (Dr. Sherri chuckles) - Is that it? - Yep. That was the last one. Go on. Get outta here. Get yourself a drink. - I think I just need a really long sleep. - Suit yourself, doc. - Oh, good luck with the game later. - Thanks. - See ya.

I'd only break your heart. - Yeah, whatever. (Chuckles) Ashley's coming and then we're gonna go get pizza. - Ooh. - [Dario] Oh, that sounds fucking capital. - I mean- - Yes. - [Lila] Clive is so weird. - So are you. - Yeah but like real weird. - And what, so you're just like a poser then? - What? - I feel like, they're not that weird. They're like, they're just dealing with the same we're dealing with in their own way, you know? - I kind of like Clive. They drew this demon thing in art class the other day, like a scene from "Dante's Inferno." It was really good. - They were in detention today for telling the chaplain to go fuck themselves.

Awkward's better than bad. - Yeah, well the rest of my family not so good. - [Lila] What happened? - Nothing happened. They just, you know, after everything, when my mum died, everything they found out about her, just never forgave that. It's like some fuckin' psycho her kills her and they were more freaked out that she's queer. - People are fucking stupid. - Yeah. I mean, hello. She was killed, probably by someone just like them. They're more worried about their little reputation in their little church. Anyway, my auntie says it's probably best if I just don't go to family gatherings for a little while. - [Lila] Do you ever go to family gatherings? - Fuck no.

Would you care for some crack cocaine with your mediocre punk song, madam? I swear, you people are killing me. Speaking of killing, God damn, did you see the news? Mass killer on the loose in the streets of our shithole town killing kids, slaughtering them like lambs. (Sighs) Jesus suffering fuck, it's like a horror movie out there. That bit of security footage they showed on the news? That mask? Man, I've seen that mask before. It's gotta be over 10 years ago now. Yeah, I'm old, fuck you. It was Halloween then, too, and there was a bunch of killings just like these right here in this town. Witness saw the killer gut some kid right in front of him. Killer wore the same damn mask. I swear to God. Couple kids got ripped up trying to summon a demon or some shit, too. Now, I ain't superstitious or nothin', but I do think there are some things in this ugly old world you just don't fuck with. Thing best not woken up, you dig? And maybe, just maybe, some damn fool kid went and woke up the same thing that woke up back then. So take it easy out there, kids. Stay indoors and listen to my shit show. (Laughs) All right, what shit are we throwing up first here? Ah, fuck no, anything but that. Ah, shit. All right, this track is better than a kick in the balls, I guess.

Kids have been murdered and you're talking about participation metals. Get some- - Oh, sorry about that. Look, are you sure that you're okay going to school still? - If you leave me locked up alone all day, I'm gonna kill myself. - Yeah, right. Fair enough. Will you just let me know if, if, you know, if it gets too much for you? - Youse guys, you gotta listen to me. - [Dario] Fuck off. - Just listen to me, okay? I know what you guys must think of me, but they're still following me. The police, they think I'm involved, but I'm not. You guys gotta know that, I'm not. - Oi, excuse me. Oi! - I'm sorry. I wasn't there. I know you guys don't like me, but it's still out there. - This is school property. If you don't leave, I'm gonna be forced to call the police. - I'm leaving town. I'm not supposed to, but it's following me, too. I'm sorry, okay? I'm so fucking sorry, but I'm not- - Look, I said get. - Fuck off. Who's following you? - Not who, it. Look, I know what's happened and I know you guys have no reason to trust me. - Suzan! - Hop in and I'll show you. - Suzan, call the police! - I was in lockup when the others got killed. Your mate, Sam? I just got out. I swear. The police think I'm involved, but I'm not. Please, you gotta trust me. Get in. - Hey. (hit thuds) (Mr. Kelly grunts) (door closes) (van starts up) Oh, fuck. Thanks, you guys. I knew you wouldn't bail on me like- - We don't trust you, so don't try and drive us out into the woods or some shit, okay? Understand? - I understand. I won't do anything to you- - Just shut up. Where are we going? - My mum's place. It's just a couple of blocks from here. I need to show you something. Ah, Jesus. You don't have to come inside. Just stay out here. (birds chirping) Wait right here. I'll be, I'll be back. Shout out if you see the cops. (door closes) - All right, I'm out. - Can you just wait a minute? - Are you fucking kidding me? This is the stupidest thing I've ever done. We are like the kids who go down into a basement in a fucking horror movie. - It's unlocked. You can leave at any time. - Fine. (Dario laughs) I can't believe you gave Mr. Kelly a shot in the pills. - Yeah well he's a prick. Yeah, but they'll probably expel you for that one. - Oh my God, what? Poor little traumatised me? I'll just plead insanity. - You know what's weird about all of this? - What the fuck's not weird about all of this, Dario? - No, seriously, now that we're in the 10th level of hell, I've never seen you more, I don't know, confident. - Okay, well, I'm not confident. - Well, I mean, half the time we couldn't even get you to leave the house and now you're punching teachers in the nuts, jumping into random ass fucking vans, threatening to kill people. And look, nothin'. Not one cut since all of this started. - What about you? - Me? Nah. Haven't used. You have no idea how much I want to, though. Falling apart like a wet fucking cake. (Sighs) (door opens) - Here, look. This is Blair, my big sister. Well, not really. She, they were like you, Angel, and you know, Lila. Blair was there when all of this shit started. You know how folk are talking about kids doing these satanic rituals, summoning up this thing? Well... Here. (Ominous music) - [Dario] Holy fucking shit. - Yeah. Blair was one of those kids. They found the mask in the old Boche house. - Wait, the old what house? - Boche. It's a couple of blocks from here. It was owned by this old creepy guy. The kids say he was some kind of satanist. He did rituals and black masses and shit. Anyway, when he died, Blair and a few of their friends went there to do a ritual. One of them was into that shit. - What happened to them? - I was really little at the time. Two got cut up. Blair got away. We didn't talk about it much, until a few years ago. She, they had a brain tumour and in the last days they were talking a lot of gibberish. You know the thing in your head, it mixes you up. One day they call me, all messed up. They say, "I'm afraid to die because I'm going to hell." So I say, "What do you mean?" They say, "Because I killed them." - I don't get it. So, who has the mask now? What? Some kind of copycat killer or? - Maybe, I don't know. Or maybe it's just some poor cunt that's been possessed. All I know is whatever happened to Blair is happening again. - Can you show us this house? (birds chirping) - Is this it? We're like a block away from the medical centre. - That's it. The old Boche house. No one's bought the police since the old man died. No one wants to live in a Satanist murder house, I guess. - This is where it all started? Mm, there's something really fucking weird about all of this. - Yeah, no shit, Sherlock. - Don't you feel it? I never saw the mask when we found Lila. The guy had his back turned. We never saw the mask, but I did before they put it on the news. You did, too. - You, you guys saw it in a dream, didn't you? - Yeah. I did. - [Angel] Gets inside our heads. - I don't understand. - Neither do I. (police sirens wailing) - Fuck. You guys know the way back, right? - Yeah, we're fine. Go. (van starts up) (police sirens wailing) (tense music) - You are not going anywhere! Don't walk away from me. What were you thinking? What the hell were you doing? Did you hear me? You just got into a strange van and you drove away- - It was just Garry. - I don't care if it was Bloody Santa on his sled. You had the police out looking for you. For all we knew, you could have been killed like the others. That's it. You're not going to school until they sort this out. - What were you doing? - More than you ever fucking did. - Watch your language. - Oh, fuck off. Language? You wanna know what I was doing? I was trying to figure out who killed my friends. - What? - Yeah. The cops are way too busy busting kids for smoking weed. They don't give a fuck about some queer kids getting murdered. They're never gonna catch that killer. - That's not true. - Don't, stop. Did they catch him last time? What the fuck did you even do when my mum was killed? You didn't do anything. None of you did. - I took you in. There was nothing else that I could have done. - There's always something that can be done. - Are you even living in the real world? - You know what? I don't even fucking know. I don't fucking know what's real anymore. I feel like I'm living in, like, some sort of nightmare that I just can't wake up from and everyone around me is keeping secrets from me, including you. - I'm not keeping secrets- - Don't, just don't. You saw the mask on the TV. You knew it was the one from when my mum was killed. You knew. You said nothing. You did nothing. You should have stopped it when it was happening on your watch, now it's happening again to us. Well it's our watch now. My watch. I'm going to end this and there is nothing you or anyone can do to stop me. (door slams) (ominous music) Responsible adult. (soft synth music) (insects buzzing) - I don't know. I just feel like it's been months. - It's been weeks, Ashley. It just feels like months. - I'm literally gonna go crazy just being locked up. Besides, I miss you. - Me, too. - You miss you too? - Shut up. You're not gonna be in too much trouble? - No, it's fine. What's she gonna do? Ground me? Besides, mum doesn't get home from work till like 3:00 AM so like we've got time before she comes home. - No problem. Bribed your brother again? - Of course I did. And I feel kind of bad though, you know? I just feel like he doesn't need more weed. - He's an adult. It's his problem. (Ashley sighs) - I'm just kind of freaking out at the moment, you know? Aren't you scared? - Nah. This whole thing is just being exaggerated by the news. Kids all over town are being locked up at home. Seems kinda iffy to me. Even if it was one killer, the lunatic's probably skipped down by now. - I don't know. I mean, you weren't there. You didn't see Lila. - Neither did you. - Yeah, but Angel and Dario did. - Okay, okay. Drive you home now if you want. - No, not now. (electronic music) - I'll tell you what, if anyone tries to hurt you, I'll beat the shit out of them. (Ashley chuckles) - Oh, fuck. - Oh. You know, you should probably clean up your car once in a while. - You should eat your chips, you skinny bastard. (Ashley chuckles) - You know what we can do? We get rid of all the music gear and we just lay the seats back. - Yeah. Never was any good at all this romance stuff.

(knocking on door) - What? - [Aunt Carly] Come on, get ready. - Yeah, nah. I'm actually feeling like super fragile right now, so I don't think I can deal with the group today. - Well we leave in 20 minutes. - Fuck's sake. - Mind your language. Don't smoke in bed. You'll burn to death. Sorry, about the death thing. Just be careful, okay? Or better yet, you could always quit. - I'll quit when you quit. Cheers, bitch. (people chattering) - Ready for another emotional torture session? - Yeah, can't wait. - [Dario] You hear from Ashley at all? - No, why? - I don't know, maybe nothing. They said that they were thinking of going to see Finn last night. - Shit, seriously? - Yeah, well, haven't seen each other in ages, but I told 'em not to go. - [Chase] Fucking gross. - What did you say, preppy cunt? - Oh, I'm so sorry. Did I trigger you? - Why are you even here? - You tell me. Everyone knows the killer only goes after faggots. - [Angel] What? (Chase laughs) - Yeah, sorry, no, don't hit chicks. Gentlemen and all that. What the fuck are you looking at, Rain Man? - [Counselor] Hi, everyone. - What's he even doing here? - Chase is here because his parents thought it would be a, a look. I know we're all... Today's gonna be a rather different session. I think it would be really important for us all- - Can you just cut the shit, please? - Beg your pardon? - I said what the fuck has happened? - Look, there's no need to be so- - What's happened? - Well, it seems that Ashley and a friend were found dead early this morning. It's too early to tell, but it looks like it could be... Excuse me, Angel, I really- - Shut the fuck up. Angel. (melancholy music) - It's all right, okay, they're just down there. Just give 'em a minute. I'll keep an eye on 'em. (melancholy music) - What the fuck is wrong with me? I feel so numb. How am I not breaking down right now? - I don't know. I feel the same. It's like I've gone through my whole life trying to run away from reality, thinking that I can't take it, it's too much for me. Like a fucking idiot, I would always say, "Oh, you know, it can't get any worse than this." - None of this feels real, right? Like it's, (scoffs) way too weird to be real. - Just don't tell yourself it can't feel any stranger. - I think I'm gonna kill him. Or it? I mean, whatever. (ominous music) - Them. - Hm? - I don't believe all of this fucking voodoo shit that Garry has been saying. Someone's killing everyone. I think I know who it is. I can't believe I didn't fucking realise it until now. It's literally been there the entire time- - Hey now wait, what, what's been there? What are you? - The symbol. The black metal symbol on the back of Clive's hoodie. (dramatic music) - Shit. - They were there in the alley. Fuck, maybe they were there the entire night. I don't know. - Yeah, but- - But what? You know that Clive had a thing for Lila, right? - [Angel] Yes. What about all the others? - Maybe they're, maybe they're a psycho. Do psychos need a reason to go fucking batshit? They were there the night they found Sam, too. What's that, they just happened to be there, a coincidence, like? Returning to the scene of the crime? - That doesn't actually happen in real life, does it? - I don't know, maybe they were trying to seem like they were innocent. - It's too weird. And we don't, like, what can we even do? Saying that you are right. - Maybe we go back in there, confront them in front of everyone. We tell that cop that's been trying to follow us around. - What, you think Clive's gonna do like some big Scooby-Doo conversion? - I don't know, maybe. They are kind of (whistles). - No. We're not sure. And if we are wrong, that's like really gonna hurt them. We should go to that house. - The Satan house? - Mm-hm. - Now? - Yeah, now. What's that saying? If you're walking through hell, don't stop. (Angel clicks teeth) (ominous music) - Oh. (Dario grunting) Fuckin' spiders. (ominous music continues) (curtains rustling) What are you doing? - Oh, sorry. Did you bring a torch? (ominous music continues) (drawers thudding) Creepy old box. Seems promising. (box thuds) Nothing. - No, look, there's something inside. - [Angel] What? - [Dario] The lining's been replaced. Classic secret hiding spot. My old man hogs the TV. Watches a lot of murder and mystery shows. Shits rubs off on you. See? (Dario clicks teeth) - Cool. - [Dario] Elementary, my dear Angel. - My God, shut up. - It's in fuckin' Swedish or some shit. - German. - [Dario] Huh? How do you know? (ominous music) Holy shit. (Detective speaking in foreign language) - Relax, okay? I'm not here to hurt you. I'm not... (sighs) I'm not the killer. - Yeah, you're just that fucking cop that's been following us to all our sessions. - That's me. - Yeah, what are you doing here? - My job, technically. You ran away, I followed you. - You know about this place? - Yeah. - And you know German. - Enough. - What did you just say? - "And when you look into the abyss for a long time, the abyss also looks into you." Pretty deep, huh? I didn't need to follow you here really. We all end up here eventually. - Who's all? - Those of us who are looking for answers. Do you want them or not? Look kids, your session ends in about 20 minutes, okay? I can have you back there and ready for pickups and put in a good word for you. But if you want to know what's going on here, at least what I know, then we have to make it quick. - Fine. - I learned German so that I could understand this. Elmer Boche. He was an actor in the Weimar Republic, the German system after World War I, before the Nazis took over. It was a free time. Lots of art and shit. And he was an actor in the theatre. Big dreams, not a lot of talent. Kind of drippy little shit that blames everyone else for their failure. He was pretty well off. Good family, no reason why he couldn't succeed. Maybe he just sucked at acting, maybe he was just fuckin' lazy, you know? But he got it in his head that it was all the fault of the queers. Big shock, huh? Queers in show business. Well, in his wormy little brain, they were holding him back deliberately. He vowed revenge. It's all in here. (ominous music) - What is all of this? - I don't understand it all. Occult shit, some kind of Gnosticism or monadism. You know, the world is an illusion, so magic sort of happens. (Angel gasps) I don't- - That's it. That's the fucking mask. - Yeah. He took some ancient mask from fuck knows how long ago, glammed it up and put it in with the costumes in the theatre. There was a blood bath. Little shit brags about it in there. Look, long story short, he got away with it. Hell, he didn't even put on the mask. Didn't get a drop of blood on his hands. When the Nazis came through, he joined them. At least until he was pegged as a queer himself and narrowly avoided the party purges. Fled Germany with his tail between his legs and took the mask with him. Drank himself to death in this very house. - My God, and then the kids came here and found the mask. - And it got loose. - But I don't understand, what is the mask? - It's confusing, the occult shit. But it was used for human sacrifices by priests, shit like that. Yeah. It's like a parasite. You put the mask on and it joins with you. - So what, it like controls you or something? - No, worse. It frees you. It takes all the hatred that you spent your whole life trying to control, to understand, and it lets you really feel it. It lets you surrender to it. It doesn't make you kill. It lets you kill. - And you learned all of that from the journals? - Not all of it. Now, put this shit away, all right? We need to get you back before the idiot counsellor comes out, sees we're all missing. (door closes) - [Radio Host] Afternoon news. A new development in the masked killer case has- - No one wants to listen to that shit. - Um- - [Radio Host] The body in the van was soon recognised as that of Garry Fulci, the local man who had been detained after the first murder as a suspect, later released after the subsequent murders. - Jesus Christ. - Isn't that- - Yep. - Bloody hell. You and Dario could have been killed with him. That's why I got so pissed- - Really? Is that what you're taking out of all of this? - I don't know- - Clearly it's going after everyone that's involved in any kind of way. That's me, that's Dario. Maybe that's you now. - When we get home, I'm gonna call the police. I'm gonna figure out what their plan is- - Sure. - Well maybe they're gonna put more cops on or- - You do that. (ominous music) (ominous music continues) - Wake up, Sleeping Beauty. - Ah, Jesus fucking Christ, Angel. I almost shit the bed. - Shut the fuck up. - Ah, what are you doing? - I'm going to Clive's. Do you know where it is? - Ah, yeah. - Got a Texta? - Um... Yeah. (drawers rattling) - Wait, keep it down. - [Dario] Sorry. Yeah. (birds chirping) - Is it permanent? - [Dario] Yeah. - Is Nicolodi Street far? - No, no... Just give me a second to get ready. - No. - [Dario] What? - No, I just came to say that I was going in case something- - No shit, Angel. I'm coming. - No, Dario- - Angel. - I can't- - Angel. (Dario sighs) You and Lila... Are the only fucking things in this horrible world that have stopped me from... I can't lose you, too. I'd rather die with you than live without you, so I'm fucking coming. Now give me a minute or I'll call the fucking cops and dobb you in. - Prick. Fine. Just haul ass then, all right? Bring a weapon. - Will a baseball bat do? - Yep. - Yeah okay, good, 'cause my AK-47 is in for repairs. (ominous synth music) It's not far. I had the same idea as you. - [Angel] Do you still think it's Clive? - Look, I don't know for sure, but fits the profile and all that. Creepy, quiet one, all that grizzly shit they draw in art class. If all the shit that Garry said about the mask is true, then who knows what they're capable of. - Yeah, but why Lila? And why all of the others, like why not Chase and the jocks and the pick on them, right? - Yeah, fuck. What are we doing? - I dunno. What other option do we have? We have to look. All I know is we don't have much time. He, it or whatever it is, it's coming for us anytime now and if we don't catch it first, it's gonna get us in our beds. - Yeah. Let's go. (motorcycle engine rumbling) - [Angel] Wow, what a dump. - Yeah, they live with their brother Johnno, a junkie. Small town. There's not a lot of us, believe it or not. - You're not a junkie. Anymore. Oh, fuck, look. - We've gotta follow them. - Totally. (ominous music) (ominous music continues) - Does this place look familiar to you? - Yeah. I really wish it didn't. Jesus fucking Christ. Are you sure you aren't the killer? (ominous music continues) - You. Hey! - No, stop. Don't hurt me. I'm not the one. - Why are you here? - [Detective] Go on, buddy. Tell 'em. - [Angel] You. - Me. - Are you the- - No. Neither is this one. Don't feel too bad. I thought so, too. Creepy little shit. But then I found the box, the journals. They've been helping me. - Helping you? - Helping me find it. Good little detective. - We saw you there that night. We saw you in the alleyway. You were standing over Lila. - I was following them. - You were stalking them. - No, no, I wasn't. I was, I was there that night in the bar. (ominous music) I just felt sick and ashamed that I didn't stop her, didn't do anything. I just froze. So I swore I'd find whoever it was who did it somehow. - Why? - What? - Why did you follow her? Why did you do all of this? - Because I am, look, I know Lila didn't know me, but I couldn't help how I felt. I couldn't tell them. I couldn't even talk to her- - Do we even know who the killer is? - Yes, yes. It was, it was the night I found Sam. And I was too late. Again. But I knew who it was now. - When Clive told me, I went and had a look around, found the same brand of smoke butts as the other crime scenes. The prat fucked up. It's too bad for him the magic mask doesn't make you any smarter. (motorcycle engine rumbling) - The bike. I've heard that before. - He's here. He followed you. We're not ready. - Shit, fuck. - Good. - Yeah, that's the spirit. Now I didn't know who he'd come for first. I thought maybe Clive. That's why I asked him here this morning. Sorry, kid. You were bait. Well, let's get ready, huh? Four on one, much better odds. (ominous music) - I don't see anyone. - He's coming. Is he gonna know that there's more of us here? Is he gonna know that you are here? - The mask will. It'll want me out of the way. (ominous music) - [Dario] Wait, what is it? (ominous music continues) What is it. - First Chase, then you. (Oskar chuckles) - Fair enough. Okay, enough with the shock revelations, huh? And since there's a supernaturally enhanced killer coming, hey, how about we get ready? (ominous music) - Should we hide or something? - Yeah, yeah. Maybe. - There's a couple of cupboards in the master bedroom. If we just burst out and- (flesh squelching) (Clive grunts) (dramatic music) (blood spurting) (Clive grunting) (dramatic music) - We know it's you, Chase. (dramatic music) - Hey. Hey. (dramatic music continues) Remember me? (Oskar gasps) (Oskar grunting) No. (Grunting) No. (Oskar grunting) No. No, no. No. (dramatic music continues) - What are you doing? Shoot him. - I can't. It won't let me. I never thought... I never thought that... Oh fuck, part of it's still inside of me. (dramatic music) Fair enough. (flesh squelching) (Oskar gasps) (blood spurting) (Oskar grunting) (dramatic music continues) (body thuds) (dramatic music continues) (hit thuds) (Angel grunts) (Dario grunts) (blade slicing) (Dario gasps) (dramatic music continues) - Preppy cunt. (hit thuds) (dramatic music continues) Why? - [Dario] Why? (dramatic music continues) - Why not? - What? Even without that mask, you're fucking crazy. - No, no, no, no, no. I am not fucking crazy! No, it's this whole goddamn fucking world that's crazy. It just doesn't make sense anymore. And I get it now. It's all your fault. That mask made me see that. It made me know that I am right. Oh God, that little retard is crazy. This little pathetic piece of human shit junkie is crazy. And you, Angel? You're a fucking freak. Oh, Jesus fucking Christ. Everyone can see your scars, you fucking headcase dyke. My fucking goodness, do you hear yourself? Do you? "Oh, I'm so depressed. Oh, nobody understands me. Oh, I'm gonna cut myself so I can feel something." Now it is your chance to really feel something. (ominous music) I'm going to carve your pronouns into your fucking skull. (dramatic music) (Chase laughs) (hit thuds) (Angel grunts) - Don't fucking... Laugh at me! (Hits thudding) (Chase grunts) (Chase whimpering) - [Dario] Angel, what are you doing? (ominous music) (Chase gasps) (Chase choking) (dramatic music) (bones cracking) (ominous music) (dramatic music) (mask shatters) (hit thuds) (mask shatters) (Angel sighs) - So what do we do now? - We are never gettin' outta therapy. This is gonna sound fucked, but do you know how to burn down a house? (lighter clicks) (police sirens wailing) (dramatic music) (Aunt Carly panting) (police sirens blaring in the distance) - I think you should sit down.
