** Subtitles and end lyrics by JJ ** FLORIDA Sir... - Is everything okay? ? - Yes, and you If you need me, press this button. I wore these shoes without laces, because for long flights, they are indispensable. - An excellent idea, see you later! - Hi. I 'm here! Mr. Lherminier, I'm here. Mr. Lherminier? Mr. Lherminier? - God, it's not possible! - I fell... What happened? How do you feel? I fell down. You're an hour late. 35 minutes. Look at your watch. Which watch? I said I was going to the market. - I didn't know that. - I told you. I've repeated it ten times, and you've forgotten it again. If you had arrived on time, this wouldn't have happened! I will tell my daughter. You will not tell your daughter. So then... Will you take me to the town? Later. Don't forget the medicine. I am reading my newspaper. Your orange juice. It's Florida, I hope. Yes, it's from Florida. "H?l?ne Massoulier, his wife, Paul and Anne, his children, announce with sorrow the death of Jean-Jacques Massoulier" Why are you so happy? He was my best friend! So why are you happy? He cheated me, so I'm happy! Oh, this is wonderful! Oh, I'm going to call my daughter. Leave her alone. She's too busy. The burial will be at 10 am in the Saint Sauveur cemetery. I'm ready to go. One minute, I had to change the sheets. Are you suggesting that I wet the bed? No, but I always change the sheets on Thursdays. Oh, it's Thursday. What's the date? Don't you know? - If I knew, I wouldn't ask. - Today is the 11th. It's my birthday soon, on the 18th. Ah, yes. Is that in September? No, in November. Remind me in two months, it's September. Oh, it's September. My dear little lady, I'd like to know how things are in bed with your husband? Don't start again. I wonder if it's you who takes the initiative. I'm not doing this again! I'm not asking much. I just want to know... what kind of caress you prefer. Very simple and very gentle? A little more forceful perhaps, at the beginning? I'd so much love to know. A tall palm tree. Do you want it in feather format? Tall and thin? I don't know. One that can be seen from far away. Get a Chinese one then. It reaches 4... 5 metres. My daughter lives in Florida and she's coming for my birthday. - Cool. - I want to surprise her. - Won't she be sick of palm trees? - No, on the contrary, She will feel more comfortable. How funny... Look what's in your hair. A small leaf... Modernisation is not just a necessity, it's of vital importance for our survival. In my father's time, you had to fight to win in the market. Today we are fighting not to lose. This is how Cascades works. This hydraulic claw is fully computerised It's a bet on the future, and I want to thank Mr Mascaro without whom there would be no the realisation of this project. So, a round of applause for him. Thank you. Thank you all. Excuse me... Each paper reel has its own bar code, therefore the handling and delivery are three times faster. Never again will it be done manually; it is irreversible. Great, but if the Finns don't buy it... If the claw breaks, what happens? The old forklift truck will be used. Do you think this is funny? It's weird, Vincent. I thought you'd love the change. My next goal is to go to Offenburg. There, they have big paper mills. Where is Offenburg located? Offenburg? In Germany. In the Black Forest. Aren't there wolves there? Not to my knowledge. I heard the opposite. Be careful, Mr Mascaro. Yes, but I'm not scared of wolves. A hungry female can be a danger. Who are you? Who let you into my house? You know very well, I've been working here for three months. Make an effort. What's my name? - And what is my name? - Mr. Claude Lherminier - With an H. - Yes, with an H. Check - you always carry a card. IN CASE OF EMERGENCY CALL MY DAUGHTER CAROLE LHERMINIER... What are you doing? There was no more juice from Florida, only from Spain. I thought there's not much difference. and it's also cheaper. Do you think I'd take the juice of Spain... ...instead of Florida? And you thought I'd accept that? Sit down, I'm going to serve you dinner. I 'm not hungry What time is it? - You don't have your watch? - Can't find it. It's 17:35, and I made you Ratatouille. 17:35? To hell with your ratatouille! To hell with it! I don't eat that early, like an old man! Listen, Mr Lherminier, we've already talked about it ten times. If you don't dine now, I won't stay as your housekeeper. Leave? Leave? You want to leave? What? Go! And never come back. I don't need anyone. Look who came. Do you know why I am here? Sure. My little girl has come to have dinner with her old dad. This has to stop... Never a "thank you", never a kind word. He's always trying to annoy me. Oh, the latest thing is he comes out of his bedroom naked, and struts around, showing off, trying to provoke me! Well, my father has 'absences', you know very well. Yes, when it suits him. No, sometimes he's completely lost. I assure you, he's very attached to you. I doubt it. He likes you very much, he adores your meals, he tells me all the time. "Mrs Forgeat is my fairy godmother." That's true? He said that? Yes. - "My fairy godmother"? - Yep. It'll work out okay, you'll see. My watch... My watch has disappeared. What are you talking about? You've had a good look around your room? - Certainly - In the bathroom? Yes, I've been searching all morning. I didn't find it. It's flown away... Or someone's stolen it. Why is he looking at me? Someone who dares to change Florida orange juice with that from Spain... is capable of anything. Mrs Forgeat? Mrs Forgeat! You can't do this! Do you remember? You're committed to staying. But this is too much. It was the last straw. Be nice, Martine. How about a raise? Your father now needs a carer, and I'm not qualified for that. You think you can quit like this? Without notice? Well, you owe me all my undeclared overtime. So we're even. What is this? Where did you find it? Where you hid it to accuse Mrs Forgeat of stealing. Not at all, I knew she wouldn't want it. I'm very fond of it. It's a gift from your mother. My mother... you should call her sometime. Eh, and if I have to see that 'baldy'? I've told not not to call Lionel a 'baldy'. You've been divorced from mum for 30 years, and you still hold a grudge? She left me for a 'baldy'! You think it's easy to find good people, and with references? Before Mrs Forgeat, there was Nadia, Jocelyne... Nathalie. Okay, Nathalie, I forgot. She was always in a bad mood. You'll see to it... But now I'm back to doing adverts, interviews, trials... When did this bill arrive? 3 January 1512. Oh, that's funny. Really funny. Daddy, can't you accept you need someone? to do your shopping, cleaning and meals, because I can't, I work. I know. You kicked me out, so you could take over. No! I remind you that it was you who left... who slammed the door, and I took over the factory. Okay, I'll get my bag. I brought you some money. I don't need it, I can make the withdrawals myself. Not anymore. I manage your account now. Huh? Since when? Since you bought six Gu?ridon pedestal chairs from a junk shop that took 5,000 euros for an alleged impressionist painting. It was not a junk shop, it was an antique dealer! Antique dealer? Look at this pigsty. Look at this room, it's so cluttered, there's nowhere to sit. Turn around. - Turn around! - All right! There! You can turn back. My poor father, what are we going to do with you? Don't worry, I can handle it by myself. No, you can't manage on your own anymore. A diagnosis is necessary. Diagnosis? I've the strength of a young man and the heart of a marathon runner. But it has is nothing to do with your heart. What then? Oh, I promised to call Robin. I can't believe it, I completely... Where did I leave my mobile? You seem to be a little... Well yes, what am I looking for? Your phone. To call who? To call your son. You said so. I used his name, I believe. Robin, he's called Robin. Yes, my son. - Yes, there you go. - Yes - You are so crazy. - I'm not. Completely insane... from another world... Like a UFO. That's right! Madness! Oh, you're crazy. Okay? Did you take your medication? Have you brushed your teeth? Brush my teeth? Yes, everything. I think you put crampons on me, you know? Why is it that you always see life.... and yet not? You're always seeing... the dark, desperate side of life. That's so, isn't it? Your sister isn't like that. Not at all. She's calm, serene, content to live... I would so love it if you both didn't fight anymore. But we don't fight anymore. She called. You could call her back. What time is it in Miami? We'l call her back later. Later. Later, later Later... - Good evening, Christophe. - Good evening, Madam Are you here? What a shock. You had me earlier, with the Black Forest. From the outset, I really wanted you. This trip to Offenburg... I didn't accept. not yet, you mean. I don't want to go. I'd prefer to stay. Stay because you're afraid of wolves? No, because I love you. A glass of champagne, wine? No, wine is complicated. For personal reasons, I am angry with the wine. Do you want something else? Mineral water, orange juice? - Is it Florida orange juice? - I don't know. I prefer it because... my daughter lives in Miami. You going to visit her there? - Where? - In Florida, in Miami That's where we're going, to Miami. Yes, of course, I know. I'm not completely senile yet! Still awake, Grandpa? Who are you? What are you doing here? I'm Robin. - Robin? Oh, yeah. - Yes I've come to take care of you. Take care of me? Yes, mum said you can't be on your own anymore. - Hi - Hello, Miss... This is Juliette. I'm Claude. We had dinner together tonight. Have you forgotten? I made a lasagna. What is the time? Time to be in bed. - You too. - We are in bed together in bed... 'nudus cum nude'? 'Gladius' in the 'vagina' What's he saying? It's Latin! wonder if you have... fornicated together? If you have... had coitus? - Had coitus? - Yes, coitus If you've... Yes. We have every right to! Well, yes. It's obvious. "The Massoulier burial will be at the St. Sauveur cemetery." St. Sauveur... St. Sauveur? St. Sauveur... that's my cemetery. That's where I'll be buried. And this person will be buried in the same place as me. And why not be buried next to your friend? Because he's no longer my friend. He betrayed our friendship. He wanted to buy part of my land. I sold it to him. Four years later, he re-sold it... knowing that they would be building a TGV train station. And so he made a huge profit. - And now he comes to my cemetery? - Hi. Good morning, Miss... Do you want tea, coffee... Florida orange juice? From Florida? You know the disease Yellow Dragon? Er, no! It's a bacteria that attacks the oranges in Florida. Juliette knows everything about ecology. The oranges become huge and rot and are lost. The insects have become resistant to pesticides. We'll no longer be able to drink orange juice from Florida? Would you like to lie down? I've already slept a lot! What are you going to do? I'll take care of my lamps. Good, I'm going then. So, off you go! MUNICIPAL CEMETERY All I'm asking is that this individual is not buried in my cemetery. There must be a legal solution. I don't know. I am new here. - Your name is Jos?phine? - Yes. Well, Jos?phine, imagine your father being buried next to a murderer. What would you think of that? I wouldn't like that much! Well, you see? Yes? Right. Wait, I'll talk to my boss. Won't be long. Well, this is a first! If you don't want to be near Mr Massoulier, go elsewhere! I can't leave my wife on her own! Since your wife will be going there? My wife is buried in this cemetery. I will join her... when time comes. Listen sir, this is not really our responsibility. Massoulier ruined life. He will not ruin my death. Perhaps if you ask the family of the deceased, they'd accept a cemetery change? Claude... So good to see you. It's a kind of you. I'm really grateful. Daddy often talked about you. Regretting not seeing you anymore. For 30 years, we were inseparable. We shared everything... our secrets... our wishes, our desires... and chess! So many great games we both played. Your father was absolutely unbeatable. When I thought I had him surrounded... Wham! Checkmate in 2 moves! My God... Then one day, we stopped seeing each other. I thought I absolutely should call the old man, but... Would you like something to drink? A glass of wine? No. No wine. The funeral will be on Tuesday. You'll come, I hope? You know the history of the land? - What land? - My farming land... that your father changed from a vineyard. Once again this story? He re-sold for a fortune, knowing that it would be for a TGV train station. My husband bought your land in good faith, and then offered part of the profit to you. And you refused, out of pride. - And Massoulier is not from Limoges? - Yes. And his family were from Limoges? Yes. Then why do you want to bury him in St. Sauveur? I don't understand what you're trying to say... Bury him in Limoges, and everyone is happy. Okay. Bingo! Enough. Get out of here. If you carry on pretending to be the master here. That house is mine. I will make it known. You're not going to answer? - It's my father. - Ah, it's your father. Come on, something may have happened. I'm not going to stop my life every time he calls. You realise that you've launched into these people, even before the funeral? Exactly! You don't believe in resurrection, or in eternal life? You don't believe in anything? This time I decided to fight. Right, for a place in the cemetery! You reproach me... for wanting to rest in peace next to your mother? No, but my mother is alive, let me remind you. You're talking about Nathalie, your previous wife. She's the one is buried in St. Sauveur. Okay yes, Nathalie, yes... ...lentil soup with prawns. Lentil soup with prawns and squid. with shrimps and squid... lentil stew with prawns and squid. You've planned a means of getting about? My brother will give me a used car. Listen, my father is reluctant to get help. I'm used to it. He may behave strangely. How? He can be unpleasant at times.... He is nice. Okay yes, he is nice. Daddy? Daddy, this is Ivona. Good morning, sir. You can call me Claude. Good morning, Mr Claude. Claude! - Have we met? - I don't think so. Your face looks familiar. - Monaco? - No. - No. Bucharest, maybe? - No. Ivona's come to see how she can help you. Here we have the dining room. And here, the living room. Take a look. It's not worth showing her around if you don't like her. No, no! I think she's great! And then, for clothes there is a laundry room in the basement. I know it's not very practical, but that's how it is. And you, what is your job? I take care of people. What people? Those who need me. Ah yes, like the pack of maids you regularly send me, supposedly to help me. But why? Help me with what? And what do you do? I am a bar pianist. Yes, he played with Louis Armstrong in New Orleans. No, no. I only played in palaces and casinos. Why don't you play for us? Where is your piano? I don't need it. Since you're leaving on a trip... Since you now say to me goodbye. promise me... Promise me to be a good girl I want to smile, with courage. Since you are leaving, for your travels And since we will be leaving this evening. My heart must learn. Promise me that everything will be all right, good girl. and for the sheets it's the same, you can hang them up inside, or outside, if it's nice. Will you need me at the weekend? No, he usually comes to my house... ...or my son Robin comes to him. Since your job is helping others, you can help me... Yes? If you could explain to my daughter that... that I don't need anyone to help me. And when I am dead, she can worry about me even less. What are you saying? I am explaining the situation to Ivanhoe. Ivona. I'm counting on you, because she no longer listens to me. I'm not asking for anything. I just want... ...peace. Peace! Don't worry. His reaction is normal. You can see how he needs someone? And I need this job. Everything will be fine. What is this? - Good morning. - Good morning. - We brought the palm tree. - What palm tree? A gentleman ordered a palm tree. It's for his daughter from Florida. He wants to surprise her. I'm sorry. Thank you. Goodbye. I have to tell you... that if my father talks about my sister, Alice or says she's coming... Your sister in Florida? Yes, but my sister will never come. She died in a car accident, nine years ago in Miami. This is my daughter. She's living in Miami. I have two sons living in Miami, as well. I have two sons who live in Miami. I will be lucky enough to stay in her... I only speak French, sorry. in her villa... There are many palm trees outside to see. Wonderful, formidable. Hi Mr. Claude? Mr. Claude? Enough! It's not funny at all. I won't help you get up off the ground anymore. My watch! My watch has disappeared. I put it there... ...and it's disappeared. I'm fine with thieves, But, if you accuse me, I'd like something of value, so I won't be fired for nothing! You won't stay in this job for long, Yes, because you will die soon. I am used to that with old people. Is the orange juice from Florida? Yes, why do you ask? because my daughter Alice lives there, and she's going to visit me soon. Good. Don't forget your medicines. Oh, no! Madame Carole asked me to tell her everything that happens here. - Yes. - She worries about you. Yes, yes... Her mother was the same, all the time, organising the lives of others. In Romania, where I come from, everyone spies on everyone. Everyone denounces their neighbour. I'd never denounce anyone. It disgusts me. For me, it's rice pudding that disgusts me. It was during the war... There was a dying German soldier and... ...he threw up and... ...it looked like rice pudding. After that, never again rice pudding. As you wish. Hello, I would like to speak to Alice Newman. It's her father. - Hello. - Yes, yes... You have reached Wallace's residence. We can't answer right now, but leave a message after the beep. We'll call you back as soon as... Claude? Ivona. What are you doing locked up in here? Haven't you see what a lovely day it is outside? Is Mrs Forgeat here? Mrs Forgeat is no longer here, now there's Ivona, but she doesn't come on Sundays. Come on, get up. We'll get dressed, and I'll take you for a ride. Guess who called me. If you don't stand still, I can't help you. Your sister. - She called me. - When? She's coming in a few days. I hope you don't fight on my birthday. Please behave yourself. We won't fight, I promise. See how beautiful you are. It's true, not bad. - Here. - You don't like it. No, it's not that. It doesn't look good with the jacket. All right. I thought it was just the two of us. Thomas insisted on coming. - Thomas?. - Yes, he's my boyfriend. Pleased to meet you, sir. This is Thomas, Daddy. Me too. Delighted. He works at the plant. It was he who installed the hydraulic claw. Ah! The hydraulic claw... And you remember Juliette. My car! I thought I had sent it to the dump. No, it's a surprise for you. I got it complete restored. Oh, my God. I recovered used parts from collectors. It took months. - Are you happy? - Oh, it's not possible! - Are you happy, then? - Oh, yes Florida. Is it an American car? No, it is French. - Give me the keys. - No, you can't drive! You notice, my daughter is a veritable dragon! Last time you drove, you were going the wrong way. Me... I took the motorway in the wrong direction... Yes. No, I don't want to bathe... ...coming! Leave me... No, no... - Nobody takes me. - Come here... No, no Looked beautiful, but really cold! - Are you talking about my daughter? - No, the lake water. Lake water, of course... I've never seen my daughter with an air so... happy. It's because of the lake air. But usually she doesn't enjoy life as much as she should. She's not skilled at happiness. No, you are wrong. Carole takes some knocks, it's true, but bounces back again straight away. Interesting, what you said. I knew nothing about how to lead a company. But, when I replaced Daddy, I suddenly had to face it all. Must have been tough. Either I did it, or left everyone in the lurch... When the Canadians bought the factory, they asked me to stay. So... I stayed. What do you guys want? Eggs and mayonnaise? The children's pizza? That would be good. ...it's not our card, ...it's recycled. Yes, it is 6-ply, 300 weave. - Exactly. - Grandpa, how do you know... It's easy. When you tear it, and... ...and all you see is grey, not white, like ours, ...it's recycled. See? There's ink residues there. It's very poor quality. One can make perfect cardboard with recycled paper. I'd really like to see that! It's true. In Canada, they use soda and kaolin that whiten perfectly. Don't teach me my trade. I led the company for 37 years. So, I know all this. You did manage it, but it's your daughter who's leading it today. What does it matter if the cardboard is white or not? Recycling conserves the planet's resources. My grandmother has it all figured out for when she's too old. She will die in Switzerland with 'Dignity'. How awful. It's not horrible. It's rather cool. You drink a poison, and you die sweetly. as if going to sleep. She refuses to become a vegetable. I would like to be a small vegetable. An onion, that will make the cook cry... Or, perhaps an aubergine. An aubergine, which becomes... the queen of Moussaka. Or then, there's always an aubergine... between the thighs of a pretty young girl, in search of pleasuring herself. Daddy, enough with this... With what? Pussy... Fucking... ass... balls...... Nobody wants to fuck in this country! Don't leave me here alone. Look at me, piss everywhere. No problem, let me do it. Lift your foot... Lift your foot... the other one. Here. Watch out. - Done? - Yes. Turn up the... Ready. - Are you okay? - Yes. Your friend is nice. What is his name? You tell me. Are you testing me? - Exactly. - His name is... Thomas. You know, I think Thomas is a real catch. He's reassuring... I feel that I can trust him. That's has not happened to me in a long time. You listening to me? I'm wondering whether he has all his teeth. Are you okay? Yes, he fell asleep in the end. Let's not talk about him. And you, Carole, all right? All right. I mustn't be late. It's all right, Mr Claude. You'll get there on time. I told you not to call me Mr. Claude. Just Claude. Look, Claude... I bought you shoes with Velcro. Like this. You'll no longer have problems with laces. You're very kind! - I'll pick you up at 5:00. - Yes, at 5 o'clock. Is there no one at the dryers? We are the dryers. And I didn't see anyone at the machines, either. Of course not. Oh yes, and what if there's a blockage? We'll see it there on the control cameras. From the cameras? - Blanchot is not here? - Who's that? Th?r?se Blanchot, my secretary. Ms Blanchot has not worked here for a long time. Did you replace her? - You're daughter is not here. - What about my daughter? What kind of mess is this? There were only three workers at the drying plant. Since I no longer come here, everything is out of control. It's intolerable. Mr. Lherminier, You should go home. You told me we wouldn't wait. He's coming. Daddy... Wait! I've got things to do. It took ages to get this appointment. If you want, afterwards we can have a rum baba at Les Delices. It's true, the rum babas are good there.. Do you remember the last time? They left us a whole bottle of rum on the table. How old are you? 81... 82 coming up. We will celebrate my birthday. - And where were you born? - In La Baule. In the lower Loire, as it happens, because my mother was there on holiday. And... your profession? I am a cardboard and paper industrialist. Of course, you are retired? Yes, I am retired... ...for a few years now. That was which year? '96. Not in '95? '96. You're sure? '96, I told you. And was that when you bought your house? No, no. It is the old family home. My grandfather built it in 1852. What day is it? What day is it today? Good. What is the exact floor area of your house? - Exactly? - Yes. I don't know. How many rooms do you have? That's enough. I've understood your game. I won't be signing your paper. I won't be selling my house. But Daddy, we're not here for that. I'm talking to your friend. Your friend the Notary. He's a Notary, isn't he? Daddy, please stop. She wants the house, as soon as possible, before inheriting it. But she will die before me. I will go to her funeral, and make a speech. I will say what this woman was like... You get it? You get it? Hi. Everything okay? You want some good news? Guess. Guess. I was accepted at Berkeley. Very good. - You aren't happy for me? - Yes, I am. I am very happy, but... ...I've had a hard day. - Are you alright? - We'll celebrate, okay? - Would you like a drink? - Like you. Two KePs, please. This is where I want to be buried, next to my wife. We lived together for 10 years. In total harmony. One day I was sitting on the edge of the bed... and poof, she's dead. Like blowing out a candle. Give me a stone. - Give me a stone... - To do what? What are you doing? Are you crazy! Or what? You can't do that! Claude? You want me to go? No, no, I'll go. Finally! What's going on? I've been calling for an hour! When you call me, I come. Yes you'll come, especially for the fat one, there... ...the businessman. He has not been well, I took care of him. That's my job. I'm also sick. I have the yellow dragon virus. The yellow dragon... The yellow dragon! Try to get some sleep. You're disturbing everyone. See you later. Dear Daddy! It is not good to appear unannounced. I wanted to surprise you. I came with Andrew, We're going to Geneva, and I've come to say hello to my Daddy. You'll stay for dinner? No, but on the way back I promise I'll be back for good.... Why don't you stay? I can't, Dad, I'm sorry... Stay with me. I can't, Dad. I have to go, you know. - What's wrong with you? - Nothing. Don't go. - We had a nice evening. - Oh, yeah... He brags to the house and the Mercedes... He sees you as a loser. And that hurts me! Well, it's true, So what would you like to do? Look out! Sir. Is everything okay, sir? My daughter promised to come back. I'm looking for her. - Where's that, sir? - Excuse me... Hold on, sir. We'll take you there. - No grated cheese? - I'm bringing it. There you go. Good evening. I don't know how to thank you. Really. Look who's come, your daughter. You're not the one I was waiting for. It's the other one, Alice. But yes, it's her. Okay, Daddy... Alice, whom I've invited for my birthday... But she came and didn't even apologise, because she is interested... only in herself... a real bitch She used to say: "Daddy my sweet, you're wonderful" "I love you so much, oh Daddy!" Yes, she goes: "Dearest Dad, I adore you"... ...my ass! She only wants to steal my money. That's enough. Are you out of your mind, or what? When she returned from the United States, it was exactly the same. exactly the same, she forced me to send her money. What a bitch! Please, shut up! Now you're pissing me off! You shouldn't talk to your father like that... Yes, a girl must respect her father. You know what? You adopt him! Adopt him. I'll leave him with you! Did you see... how she talks to her father? I'm sorry, but night hours cost twice as much. Don't take advantage of the situation. I'm not the one who sets the rates. If it is too expensive, just put your father in a nursing home. I don't want my father go to a nursing home. I'll offer you 100 euros per night, That's huge, especially since he sleeps at night Not always. You saw what happened. But it won't happen again since you'll be there to monitor him. All right. To help you out. I very much like your father. Thank you. You can take the room upstairs. He says it's for your sister, when she comes back. What are you doing? I'm taking a shower. If you'd like to have dinner without me, it's ready. - Can I come with you? - Where? To the bathroom, I'd very much like to watch you shower. But Mr. Claude, that's not possible. But I won't bother you, I'll be very discreet. No, I told you, it's out of the question! No problem, he said he could use their truck. A big truck. Very big! Don't forget the tools. Why do we need tools? - To dig. - Dig what? The land. You told me it was for a move. Yes, to move M. Massoulier. But you know he's dead! We can't do that... dig up a dead man! That's sacrilege. A dead man must rest in peace. We can't touch it. We're not it Middle Ages, my child. (Dialogue in Romanian) . - We don't transport coffins. - No coffins. 1,000 euros. 1,000 euros? And risk going to jail? - 2,000 euros. - No... They won't risk it, it's too dangerous. Well okay, 3,000 euros, with that... ...I could have the whole cemetery dug up. Promise me that everything will be all right, good girl. Yes, as beautiful as a gold mine... You're the new nurse? We're not in a hospital, sir, we're on a plane. You are very elegant. You too, Claude. I've brought you some wine. Oh, in your name? Yes, it's from my vineyard. It's my wine. We'll be celebrating Massoulier's change of cemetery. Is it confirmed for tomorrow? I don't know yet. They will let me know. Please taste. You're not drinking any? No, I'm angry with the wine. Tell me what you think. Frankly, I don't know anything about it. Please, have some more. - It is good. - Good. The wine is very delicate. It can be exhilarating, rich in aromas, with... something mineral, vegetable... ...something totally unexpected. It can be wonderful! That's it! It is wonderful. Like you. Follow me. I'll give you some money. It's not urgent, Claude. I insist, absolutely. I hide the money here. that my daughter gives me. - How much do I owe you? - I don't know. Take it all. - No, it's too much... - I will say that I lost it. I'll say it was stolen. So, I'd prefer you to have it. You know, I'm not a bad girl. I know. I know you're not. Why are you telling me this? Mum, I'm ready. - For what? - For college. - I can take you. - I can take the bus. No, I'd love to. Just give me two minutes. - But I might be late. - I won't be long. Hi Grandpa, did you sleep well? All right, Daddy? Where are we? What is this place? We are in the city. In Annecy, in my house. In my flat. - In your flat? - Yes. How did this happen? You've been living here for a month. You know very well it's impossible at your home. Why? You couldn't live there alone, after Ivona left. Has Ivona left? Yes, Ivona is gone, with the money you gave her. Money? The money you gave her for digging up Massoulier. She never intended to do so, fortunately. - Shall we go? - Yes, I said yes. Because we are already late, and there is traffic. - Take it easy! - I'm off. - I'm leaving. - Wait! - Good morning, Carole. - Good morning, Nancy. Good morning, Mr Claude. Are you okay? Here' the shopping money. Thank you. Yesterday he ate meat. No problem, you can make fish. - He said he is allergic. - Really? - Are you now allergic to fish? - I'm not allergic to fish. I'm allergic to you. - Well, you can make some pasta. - All right. There you go. I'll get you some orange juice. Your sister gave it to me. No, I gave you this shirt, Daddy. Really? When? Ten days ago, on your birthday. My birthday? Was Alice there too? No, she couldn't come. Good morning, Claude. - This morning, you meet the Germans? - Yes, at 11:00. I hope everything goes well. I'll cross my fingers for you. Who was that? Thomas, my partner. He lives here. You know, he installed the hydraulic claw at the factory. - It is useless. - What do you mean, useless? You repeat the same thing to him every day. Well, it is difficult. We all have to make an effort. You don't think I make an effort? I want to go home! Of course, we'll see... when you're better. No, now! And you, get out of here. All right, Mr Claude? Let's go. You're not too cold? This is not a clinic. It's really a place for living... There are several activities every day. Classes for painting, drawing, cooking classes, singing... - Our choir is famous. - A choir? There is a multi-purpose hall. Now there is a drawing course with an art teacher. I'll show you. Daddy, what are you doing? I am travelling. Residents can bring their own furniture to create a familiar environment. It's very important to feel at home. - Excuse me... - No problem. Have a good day. - Mrs Desbois? - Yes? - It's me. - Come in. Good morning, Ms Morel. We've come to visit your room. You look very elegant today. Is your granddaughter coming? - Ah, that's lovely. We don't call it a refectory here, but a dining room. Wanting to eat is essential. Food is life, the simple pleasure of sharing, enjoying. Then there's the social side. They leave their rooms and come here. They have personalised napkins. Salad, sausage, lentils, cheese, rice pudding... Rice pudding... I must admit that with married men, sometimes we have problems. I don't want rice pudding... No problem, you can order a fruit. I want to go to my city. - I want... my city... - Yes. ...I am going to my city. I have something to tell you. Your mother has decided to put me in a retirement home. What is this nonsense? We visited the place. It's very nice. Nice garden, good spaces, but there is a problem... - They serve rice pudding. - Rice pudding? Rice pudding for dessert. Grandpa, I won't be able visit you, I'll be in college. Hello, Claude. It's nice that you agreed to meet me. Do we have an appointment? Yes, Mr Massoulier called you yesterday. Among my father's papers, I found something. I found a document that shows that he knew they would build a train station on your land. He'd already known the route of the TGV train for four years. So, you were right! He made an enormous profit from selling that land. I am happy that your father got a good deal. Here is a cheque for you, by way of compensation. But what is this? I don't want that money. Frankly, it would be a relief for me. In memory of my father. What was your father's name? Jean-Jacques Massoulier. I knew a Massoulier... He was very nice. I'm in in Annecy. You know Annecy, in France? So where is this factory? Sweden, okay. No, not now, I can't. No, I can't. When do you plan the second part of this project? Okay, great. I'll think it over... Right, okay, I call you back soon. Bye. Thank you. Claude, I'm working. It doesn't bother me at all. Good. Can I ask a question? - Okay, go ahead. - Do you have all your teeth? - And can I ask you a question? - Certainly. When will you stop annoying us? I still hear the phone ringing that night. It was I who took that painful call. It was the French consul in Miami. They didn't know how to tell me the news. My mother was in a state of shock, and my father stayed to take care of her. They couldn't go to Florida, so I went to my sister's funeral alone. How does your father forget that she is dead? Perhaps he is losing his memory so as not to remember it. And you'll never tell him the truth? I don't know... I think it would be too violent for him. 10 minutes later he will have already forgotten. Carole, do you realise that you organise your whole life for him? Around him, and he has no idea? It is natural that I have to do this for him. Is it natural to be so unhappy? Why don't you put him in that nursing home? I can't decide. It is the ideal solution. The only one. - But I'd be abandoning him. - No, not abandoning. It will be much better than at home with you. There is a long waiting list, it is necessary to decide. I can't, don't force me. Stop it. - And where am I? - You are here. Sir? Are you looking for the bathroom? - No, I'm looking for the exit. - You can't get out now. My watch was stolen. Look. Sit down and try to sleep. There's still 3 hours to go. Lucky you dodged him okay. He could have cracked your skull. You were lucky! You should make a complaint. I would do something about it, because... ...he can be dangerous, this man, if not supervised. Don't worry. You have a very beautiful watch. Yes. You've had it a long time? - Why? - I was wondering... What? You have... ...the invoice for your watch? What do you want to see the invoice for? Do you think this is your watch, is that it? It's a diver's watch! Is it yours? Anyway, someone stole mine. All right, darling? Do you want me to make tea? No, thanks. Herbal tea? Boldoflorin? La boldoflorin, It tastes good... Something alcoholic. - Alcohol helps. Some rum? - No, I don't want anything. I am very sorry about your friend Thomas. You don't give a damn, and you say you are sorry. Frankly, if you want my opinion, this boy is not for you. He has something... something... -...we have... huh? - Shut up. The family... must remain united. So, I beg you.. ...call your sister. What about my sister? Among women, you can talk. Exchange ideas. Well, I'm going to have a bath. Dad, please. I need to be alone. Make up with Alice. Call her. I don't want to. - Are you still angry with her? - No, no, I am not angry. But you look angry. I am not angry. Call her. If you knew how important it is for Alice. - And for me! - Enough, Dad, this is not the time. Yes. It is the time. I can't call Alice, that's the end of it. - May I ask why? - Because... - Why? - The time difference. The time difference. You call her, she answers, she listens to you, she hangs up quickly, and that's it! Come on, enough! Get out of here! If you were generous, you would call her. But you are not someone who's generous. You're petty... Jealous... Cold, as well.... A little mean-spirited. Mean-spirited. You want to know why I don't call her? Do you want me to tell you? Do you really want me to tell you? - Alright? - Yes. I have something to tell you. Grandpa? Don't worry... Everything will be fine in the retirement home... It's not me going to the retirement home, it's you! It's you who'll be chomping on rice pudding. I won't eat rice pudding. I can't stand it! Mum will throw you into the old people's home. She's already decided, it's happening. I won't go to an old people's home. Do you still have your savings? Yes, you told me to save it for something important. Exactly. You have your driving licence? You haven't told me where you're going? In the land where it's sunny, with white sand and a warm breeze in the palm trees. Cool! Where exactly? We're almost there! You need to move on, ma'am. Here comes another one... Sir, you can't stop here. It is forbidden. You wait for me while I go and park? Sir... We are landing soon. Raise your seat, please. Ladies and gentlemen, we have just landed in Miami Airport. It's 8:00 a.m. local time, and the temperature is 22 degrees.. Goodbye, Miss. Enjoy your stay in Miami. - Hello, taxi, please? - Oh, right down the hall. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - I'm going to Morning Side Drive. - Okay. My daughter lives here... - Hello, can I help you? - Hello. I'm looking for my daughter. - Your daughter? - Yes, my daughter. Her name is Alice Newman. Okay, just one second. Andrew? Andrew, can you come here just for a second, please? - Sure, what's going on, babe? - Hello! He's looking for... Alice... - Just one second. - Okay. - Good morning, Claude. - Good morning. This is incredible. What are you doing here? It was a good trip. Not exhausting at all. Alice wasn't there. She hadn't come to meet me at the airport. Claude... She is no longer here. Are you divorced? No. She has left. Left? Claude, she has left us. You know that very well. Here. Good morning, Claude! Did your walk go well? It feels good to get out a bit. Come on, I'll take you home to your room. Come. Good morning, Mr Lherminier. Come along... come with me to your room. - Are you an air stewardess? - No, I'm a nurse. You remember how to raise the bed? Just press the button. Ring the bell if you need anything You're called Jennifer? No, I'm Sylvia. And you? Me... ...it's Claude. Because... my mother wanted... ...a girl. And Claude would be good in both cases. I hope she comes on Sunday, because... I don't like being alone, on Sundays in the guest house. Claude? Claude, can you hear me? - Will we arrive soon? - Where's that? In Miami. - You have a visitor. - Is it my mum? - It's your daughter. - My daughter? Yes. You're in luck! Thank you. Oh, it's you. You've come to get me? I'm going home. This is your home now. Your new home. New home? We are emptying the old house to sell it, remember? By the way, in the cellar, I found more than a hundred bottles. "Domaine Lherminier" Yes, it was your wine. I thought it might please you to keep one as a souvenir. Why not? But... I am angry with the wine. But you don't even remember why. Don't you think it would be time to make up. It is refined, subtle... ...elegant... One should never get angry with wine and with people It's a waste of time. Taste it. What do you think? It's good. You too... you're good, Carole. Carole... Will we see each other again? Of course... soon. Oh my! They also have plane trees. I would never have believed it. It's really beautiful, Florida Since you are leaving on a trip Puisque vous partez en voyage Since we are leaving each other tonight Puisque nous nous quittons ce soir My heart will learn a lesson Mon cour fait son apprentissage I want to smile with courage Je veux sourire avec courage You see...
