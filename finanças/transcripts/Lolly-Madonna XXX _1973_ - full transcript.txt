Hey, Thrush. Thrush. Thrush! Let's go get that Lolly Madonna. Come on. Hawk, will you hush your squawkin'? You always got your tail feathers in an uproar. Why don't you let a hard-working man get some sleep? - Hold on you got a little... - Get out of here! Let's go out. Good thing we found her postcard. Ludie Gutshall ain't gettin' married, no way. Who's watching the still. Hell, we ain't gonna be gone long. What that Lolly Madonna looks like? She's probably got a wart. - It's Hawk and Thrush. - They bought it. Let's go. Son of a bitch. He fell for it. Come on, Ludie. Whoo! Look out, now, we gonna get our hogs back. Yee-haw! Wait over there across the road. Red Barn comes by every 30 minutes. Thank you. My name is Roonie Gill. I was just changing buses on my way to Nashville. Actually, I didn't care much where I was going. It just felt good to be on my own for the first time. I never heard of the Feather family or the Gutshalls before that. I found out later, that Ludie Gutshall had planted a postcard in the Feather mailbox to get them away from the still. He signed it, Lolly Madonna. And that's who they thought I was. By the time I knew what was happening... There wasn't much I could do about it anyway. Ah! Ah! Put me down! Uh! Help! Help! Help! Ah! Ah! What the hell are you doing, Ludie? Pap just told us to get the hog. Ah! Damn! Ludie! Zeb! They're on their way back. Come on! Well, we got one though. Come home, darling. Come on. Come on. Just hold on, let's fill that bug up. You got her? Okay, hold on. And tell daddy I'm checking out the still. Alright, why don't you tell the truth this time. I told you everything I know. I was just waiting for the bus, and that's all. I know that. Gutshall's are supposed to pick you up after the bus came here. I don't know these people, that you keep calling the Gutshalls. I don't know anybody around here. Give me the postcard. "Dear Ludie. "I'm due to arrive at Hankey Junction' "on the 8:30 bus. "I'll buy my wedding dress "in Hankey, so Elspeth can help me pick it out. "I'll be waiting for you at the bus stop." "I love you." "Kiss. Kiss. Kiss." "Lolly Madonna." Now... You deny that you wrote that? My name's Roonie Gill. And this isn't even my handwriting. Give me a piece of paper and I'll show you. Sh-shh! Anybody can change their hand-writing. That don't mean anything. Listen, why don't you just call the County Welfare Department in Memphis. And they'll tell you who I am. We don't have a phone. - Chickie, hand me the bottles. - What was that? Thrush. Gutshalls busted up the still again. When's that man ever going to leave you alone? First he takes the meadow, now this. There's no end to it, Laban, I'm tellin' you that. It's okay this time, Chickie. We got something Pap Gutshall wants. I'll get my lamb back. Hey! Come on, darling! - Whoa! - Ludie. Have you told her yet? I didn't know what to say to her, Robert. After what Larry said, she just seemed so despondent. Larry... The bank called again. Well, that'll have to wait. Get the biscuits, honey. Don't know how they can expect any payment when... Feather won't even let me near the meadow. Well, let's say, you'll never get it away from him. I did already. It's mine. Hell, I got as much right around here as he has. Ten years up here don't mean anything, Pap. As far as he's concerned. You're just passing through. What's Feather ever done around, except raise hell? He'll have a hell of a time putting that still back together. I didn't tell you to bust things up. I told you to get those hogs back. Hog. And that postcard business. That was just plain foolish. It worked, didn't it? What are you complaining about? I thought it was great. That was the dumbest thing I ever read. Well, that's funny now, I got it out of one of your true heart romance magazines. I don't see what's so great about that? It's the strategy, stupid. I sent them off on a wild goose chase. That was brilliant! Wonder where they got the girl then? What girl? There was a girl in their truck when they came back. What's he talking about? Beats me. Villum, what the hell are you talking about? I don't know, just some girl that all I know. - Give me the salt. - And what was she doin'? She wasn't doin' nothing. She was all squeezed down. - Well, who was she? - Lolly Madonna. There ain't no Lolly Madonna. I made that up, dummy. Oh, boy, is he quick. Well, they sure had some girl. Cause I and my field glasses trained right on her. Little bitty ol' thing with a crew cut. Hand me the salt, honey. See what you can to find out, Ludie. Excuse me. These rolls aren't very good. You fix 'em next time alright? Ma, is that coffee ready yet? - Two cards. - Two. I don't know what Ludie Gutshall wanted with her. Dainty little thing like her. She gonna be nothing, but trouble to us. Ma, she ain't done nothin' to us. - What does that mean? She... - Take a three. They busted up his field. Yeah, but he stole Pap Gutshall's hogs. He told Pap to keep them hogs off the meadow. Ma, Pap can do anything he wants to with that land cause it's his now. I think your daddy will have somethin' to say about that. What am I in for? Laban... Laban... Why aren't you going to bed? Want Hawk to go up to the still and relieve Zack? Mm-hmm. Your daddy wants you to go on up to the still and guard them hogs. Alright, I heard him. Well, go on then. Going. I'm going. I don't know why we don't eat 'em pork instead of baby sittin' em. Skylar, hon, your daddy wants somebody to keep an eye on the house tonight. Oh. Alright. What about little Miss Muffet? She ain't going any place. Hey! You still awake? They don't seem to care much for you. Did daddy say you can do that? What are you doing back so soon? We just sent Hawk up there to get you. Got tired of waiting. Coffee's hot. Don't leave a mess. Zack, ain't you going to give her a little kiss? Ought to keep in practice, a big buck like you. Maybe I don't need it as much as you do. Sure, that's probably true. You being so pure and all. You better believe it, honey. Hey, Sister E, none of that hair snort this time, I'm telling you. Well, I can't do it right without curly dew, Zeb and that's all there is to it. - Now, hold still. - Why don't you do mom instead? It's your turn. Besides, I've to practice on baby fine hair. Jesus. - Oh, hell, daddy, they haven... - Oh, shut up. Shut up! Well, they got somebody up there or not? - Yes, they have somebody. - Who is it? How the hell should I know? Is that hot? Hey, maybe they kidnapped somebody. They got Ludie's postcard. Hell, they probably fell for it. They think they got Lolly Madonna. That was really brilliant, Ludie. Now, son, exactly, what did you see up there? Like Villum said, skinny and crew cut. See, what did I tell you, daddy. - What did I tell you... - Was she pretty? Well, she ain't no two ton dog like you. Don't you talk to her like that, Ludie. Well, what the hell does she think we're running around here a beauty contest? What the hell is the son of a bitch up to? Well, we just go seek the law, daddy, like like they deserve. Now, what kind of law are you talking about? No deputy in this county gonna step a foot Feather's land. I want to think. You think all you like, Pap. But you ain't gettin' me to go back up there. - No way. - Now, you look here, son. No. You look here. Now, how come you make all the decisions and I end up taking all the risk? Because this time it's a question of principles. Well, with me it's a question of scruples. I got scruples. What kind of scruple? Bad. You know how it is with scruples, Pap. Hell, you probably got as many scruples as I do. Well, yes, scruples but... I don't think this here falls under the category of scruples. It leans more from your basic scruple to your basic principles. And my basic principle is that you and me and... And all the rest of us... Ought to do somethin' to help that girl. You know what my basic scruple is? What? Not to get my ass shot off for your basic principle. - Hey, Ludie. - What? Why don't we just go up there and explain to 'em that postcard thing's a trick? Mister, we just busted up the man's still. You're the one that busted up his still. Ain't afraid to go talk him, Pap. I wouldn't do that if I was you. I'd just bash Thrush's head in. All I got is this yellow thread or brown. Which you want? Oh, come on now, Chickie. I want her out of here. You take her out to the barn. Honey, I don't care where you take her. Just so she's out of here. Come on now, Chickie. It's nothing. Bring that light over closer. Right, there will do. Thanks, honey. Look, I don't want any stitches. Okay? You gonna take her out of here. Best get on with it. Hold on to him. Keep his head still. Come on. Ah! Ah! Hold his head still. Give me the bandage. Hey, Thrush. - You were crying real tears. - Yeah, I know. Just look at there. Shut up. Well, just look at him. Don't hit me, Thrush. I didn't do nothing. Keep out of my goddamn face, alright? I'm going to put this bandage on here. That in there... That didn't mean nothin'. I guess we both got hurt places. Old man's right up there where you can see it. Old Chickie, she pulled out that needle and thread and zup, zup, zup. She got me fixed right up. Well, you've got somethin' nobody can see. I cry real tears too. I know you do. I wasn't makin' fun of you in there. That really must have hurt bad. No. That didn't hurt. Chickie just fixed it right up. Hey, you comin'? Come on! Ah, that feels great. Whoo! Ah! Ain't you ever seen a guy without a shirt on before? Come on. Come on, get your head in here. - You made her cry, did you? - Probably. She's in there. There's something for you to eat in there. So how's Thrush? He'll be alright. I wonder why Ludie never told me about her. He's a Gutshall, man. Guess he doesn't tell you everything. That alright? Well, there's this apple tree. Come on I'll pick you some. Come on. Can I ask you something, Skylar? What? These people you call the Gutshall why do you all hate each other? Oh, it ain't hate exactly. What is it then? It's kinda hard to explain. I guess what it boils down to is... A piece of land between us and the Gutshall. Then whose is it? It was ours... Till Pap Gutshall pulled some fancy business over back taxes. Went up for auction, he got it. Nobody else in town bid on it. They knew it was daddy's by right. Guess land don't mean much to you. All of this land used to belong to my daddy's people. Hundred years before Gutshall even showed up. What's all this got to do with me? Didn't Ludie tell you nothing about us? I'm not Lolly Madonna. I never said you was. Why can't you let me go then? I can't. Zack said nothing gonna happen to you. Ladies and gentleman, we're proud to announce that we have appearing here for the first, the one and the only time that well known and loved musical personality straight from Memphis, Tennessee. Ladies and gentlemen, let's have a nice big welcome for Hawk Hudson. Thank you, thank you. Thank you very much. Well, Mr. Hudson... Just... Just call me Hawk. What you think about that, folks? Great performer. Just one of the greats of all time. Well, Hawk, it's a real pleasure. Oh, thank you. Mighty glad to be here... Always knew I'll make it here one day. Well, Hawk, you've certainly come a long way. Now, what're you gonna play for us? Well, uh... I figured I'd open up the concert with a couple of numbers from my best sellin' Hollywood album. Titled "Hawk Hudson's Hollywood Hits". It just came out. Boys. And a one, and a two, three... You ain't so hot either. No offence, no offence. That's some kind of sloppy thing those hogs. Jesus, Thrush, who done that? Get rid of that stuff. Sure, Thrush. Yo-hoo! Thrushita. Is that you I see? What a naughty boy you are to laugh at Hawky. * Bam bam bam-ba-bam ** At least my face doesn't look like a Mack Truck ran over it. I never... I've never seen such a sorry... Yeah, well, you don't help, you know. I should have joined the army when they come after me. Ah... Shit man, those guys in uniform... They can get all the tail they want. Yeah... I can just see you now. Yeah! You have the... The brass buttons up and down you, you know... Them wraparound shades. Ha-ya! I might've been a real pretty boy, huh? Suppose that's why we're not married, by now... Why, darling, you never asked me. Keep away from me. Oh, now, that ain't friendly. You're drunk. Now, that ain't true. We've just been talkin' about how much we'd like to have a lady friend. I thought you had some girl up here? We ain't got just some girl. We got us Lolly Madonna. * Lolly Madonna ** And now we got you. Whoa! Now, you act like you ain't been there! Comin' all the way up! I didn't come to make any social call! Then what did you come for, Sister E? I want to see Skylar. Well... Skylar ain't here. Now, if you come to see us... ...that's one thing. Otherwise, it looks like you're just trespassing on private property. Yeah. Well, haven't you heard what we do to white women? Hmm? What's that lipstick all over your face? War paint? Wrong! Isn't it part of fertility right. Hmm. You! The other part. One young big chief like me. - You've taken a what you want. - Huh? White woman, red man, make pink babies. Indian chief, my foot! You look like a shitty little queer! Oh, now, honey, you ain't going nowhere. Easy, honey. Now, you know, Skylar don't like you no more. But I do. Easy honey, easy little baby. Look, look at that. We're gonna have us some real good time. Easy now, easy. Not him! Not him! Well... First thing, the stirrup's too long. Alright, how's that? Feet in. Is everything alright? You bet. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Hmm. Here. What's this for? Oh, your dress is a mess. Here, you could use a bath too. Better hurry up if you're gonna do it. Hey, you don't mean I gotta take a bath out there, do you? Uh-huh, why not? Well, I can't stand around with no clothes on! Christ, I'm not gonna peek at you. Hey, I don't care, I'm not gonna do it. Look, you better do it or I'm gonna strip you down and scrub you myself. You wouldn't. Don't you count on it. Villum, is the detergent in there? - It's me. I'm on the toilet. - W-well hand it out to me. It's not in here. Yes, it is. I just did the floor with it. - I can't find it. - Oh, for heaven's sake. Open the door. It's right out there in plain sight. I'll be off in just a minute. Sister E? What's the matter with you? Now, open this door. I can't. What do you mean, you can't? I remember my mother sitting with me. Once. Just this way. I'd been married all of two days. I just packed my bag, travelled myself back home. I meant to stay there too. Back then, you know the girls weren't told anything about what goes on... Well, I guess I knew a little bit. I had sisters older than me. It still came as a sorry surprise. Well, it wasn't so much... That sex seemed silly. Just seemed so rude. I didn't intend to have anything more to do with it. What did she say to you? Oh, she said it was like drinking coffee. Uh, something you had to acquire a taste for. Even to this day, I still think about that when I'm with your daddy. You went back to him. Well, I didn't have much choice. She'd already moved my brother Bobby into my room. He wouldn't budge. So... Back I went... To start all over again. First thing I knew, I was pregnant. With Rubin. Then it was different. I used to imagine... That Skylar and I would have children one day. Oh, w-well, I-it doesn't always turn out that way. There'll be someone else. I wish I could start all over again. W-well, you will, honey. When you fall in love again. All the bad just fades away. All the bad things fade. - She said who it was? - No. Well, looks like I'll be going up there after all. No, we do not know who it was, Ludie. Now, who in the hell do you think it was? Smokey The Bear? Just don't want to jump wrong, that's all. Could've been any one of them boys. I'll find out quick enough. I don't want you to go up there. I gotta have time to think what's right. Well, now, that's real fine. It's a question of Lolly Madonna or whoever the hell that little girl up there is. Right away you want me charging up. But your own daughter now, you got to have time to think. - Some principles you got. - How dare you talk like that. No, no, I want to hear him defend himself and all 'em fine principles! - H-he's your father. - He's full of shit! Listen, sonny, you're talkin' about killin'. Now, you're goddamn right I am. Oh, what's happenin' to you, Ludie? You weren't brought up that way. Wasn't I now? He raised me to be in the army didn't he? What's the army about if it ain't killin'? That's different. Not to Rubin, it wasn't! Won't you let me get the sheriff, Pap? No. This is way outta hand. I'll handle it. Mine to do and I'll do it. - I won't kill anybody. - Nobody's asking you to. When you do ask me, I won't. - Skylar. - Hey, what's wrong, man? What's that for? If you've got any wedding plans with my sister you better cancel 'em. She ain't exactly lily pure no more. Come on, Ludie, what're you tryin' to tell me? She's been raped. She, uh... I don't know which one of you done it. But you find out, you tell him next time I see him I might just use this. Where'd you get this? - What? - Where did you get this dress? Used to belong to somebody. Who? Your mother? No, my wife. So, you are married? No, not anymore. Where is she? She's dead. My mother died... And I don't remember that much about her really except when I was very young. She always smelled like lilies of the valley. And her hands were always so cool. How about your dad? Is he still alive? No. He died when I was 12. And they put me in a foster home after that. You got brothers or sister? You know, I've always kinda wondered what it would be like to have a big family like yours. It's noisy. Now, if you're the baby like me in the family you get nothing of your own. These are Thrush's boots, Hawk's pants, Hawk's shirt... Skylar was gonna give me this puppy once few years back. But by the time he had it all house trained and everything he preferred him to me, so... I guess that's just the way things work out. I know. I never had that much to call my own, either. But I always kinda thought that... I'd wanna have a lot of kids, maybe six or seven. And they'd all hang around and fuss and lie and then ask me for jelly bread. Hmm. How'd you like to have some boots that didn't smell like somebody else's feet? Didn't you have your own boots when you were in the army? No, I didn't have to go in. What about that draft notice up there with your name on it. That don't mean nothing. You know, they can put your name wherever you want but that don't mean they can make you go anywhere. They tried that with Thrush, daddy hit 'em off with a rifle so they don't try so hard now. Don't you approve of that? It's not that... I just don't know why you keep staring at me like that. Tryin' to figure you out, that's all. Why do you wanna marry some guy like Ludie Gutshall? I never heard of Ludie Gutshall until yesterday. Honest to God. My name really is Roonie Gill. Why would I lie about that? I don't know. I can't get to sleep with you starin' at me like that. Alright, I'm gonna sleep myself. Don't try runnin' off in the middle of night though. I'll have to go chasing after you. You're still staring. This suits you? Hey, now, hey, now you know everybody isn't happy enough don't you? Just as it is. Hey. Now, look at me. Now, I'm gonna take care of it, ain't I? Come on. Am I gonna take care of it? - Let me hear you say yes. - Yes. - What? - Yes. Give me a kiss. Come on. Give me a kiss. Laban Feather! I gotta talk to you. Sister E is with him. Hear me, Feather. I got no gun. I just wanna talk to you. What you want? My business ain't with you, Chickie. I don't see a gun. Go get the boys. Alright! You can come in then. What are you sitting there for? Stand up when a lady comes in the room. Now, Chickie, you get Mr. Gutshall a chair. I'll stand up if it's alright with you. What I got to say ain't gonna take very long. Okay, now you just tell me what you got on your mind. Tell him. Tell him what happened. Pap, I just can't. She was raped by your boys, Feather. You tell me. It was Hawk and Thrush. You've been up to the still. Have you been up to the still? Both my land is posted. Do you know what that means? Yes, sir. It means that they been posted that anybody puts one foot on just one foot is trespassing. Do you understand? What the hell are you talking about? Take a look at that. Okay, Gutshall, you made your point. The hell you want me to do? I'll tell you what I want. I want those boys whipped. I want my hogs back. And I want you to keep the hell outta that meadow. What about the girl? And her. No, no, no, no. You give me your land back, you get the girl. Look, you son of a bitch. I want her outta here tomorrow morning or I'm coming after. Don't you threaten me. It's no threat. I'll do it. You settle with them. Come on. Is what she said true? What's that? That you raped her. Says who? She says. Tell me. Look, daddy, uh, she did come up there. I don't deny that. She's trespassing on our land. What the heck? She's just tryin' to be friendly. Friendly? Now did you or didn't you? We never did anything to her that Skylar hadn't done. Nobody ever said anything to him. You keep your brother out of it. Look, daddy, it was her idea. You're a liar. Chickie... get Finch outta here. Come on, Finch. Oh, Christ. You boys, made two mistakes. First, you lied to me... And then you gave Gutshall a legal grievance against me, and that's the worst. Then why don't you let Pap Gutshall beat us? What gives you the right? I, give me the right. Is that what you keep us around for? To exercise your right? You don't like it here, you can clear out anytime. Okay. I'll leave now. Heard that before. Look at ya. You're not good for anything. Except horses. And you speak pretty good with horses. Okay, daddy. Have it your way. Why didn't you tell me you went up to the still. You made me look like a Goddamn fool. - What Feather said? - Shut up. Get the wire out. - Can I ask you somethin'? - Yeah. Your wife, was she pretty? Yeah. Do you think I'm pretty? You're okay. You let your hair grow and keep your face clean. What was she like, Zack? Everything, I mean... She was beautiful, warm, smart. Everybody loved her. See, we never had a girl in our family, you know? So she was really somethin' else. Did she like it up here? She was crazy about it. She liked to do all kinds of things. Like, uh, driving Daddy's car like he cut down his back rows. He used to take her in town with him. Let her have the wheel on the way back. It just scared the hell outta of him, he loved it. He used to take her, uh, target shootin'. Come home braggin' how good she was. Do you think you'll ever get married again? Would you lay off that stuff? Shit. Alright, you go get Skylar and go in town get some kerosene and I mean a lot of it. You... you come with me. Why, what's happenin', daddy? Get Zack. - Well, what's... - Shut up. Looks like he meant what he said. Post by post. Sign by sign, they're gonna drive us off. I told you. What do you think they're gonna do? I don't much care, as long as they don't come out in our meadow. You goin' back to work tomorrow? Shit no, man. Things are just gettin' good. Don't you ever think of leavin' this place? Huh, there's nothing down there. Sure, there is lot's. Nah, I like it up here. It's beautiful. You know, you grow up in the mountain... You don't come down. It's got nothin' to do with daddy... As far as I'm concerned now. It's the land with me, it's all there is. Don't you want anything else in your life? No. Aren't you afraid to smoke with all this hay around? God, you worry. Here, try it. You didn't inhale, now, watch me. You don't know how to do much in anything, do you? Where'd you get that haircut? What's wrong? Hmm? Well, nobody's ever kissed me like that before. I know that. Ain't you ever been in love before? Oh, come on, all girls been in love by the time they're six years old, I know that. I haven't. Come on. Hey, Roonie, I'm must teasin' with you. Don't get mad at me. Zack! Yeah, what do you want? Daddy says when it gets dark, he wants you down at meadow. What for? I don't know what for, I'm just telling you what daddy said. Alright, tell him I'll be down there. Okay, I'll tell him. - It's me. - We know it's you. Hey, Vill, did you tell Pap? - Daddy. - Ludie. Yeah. - They up there? - Uh-huh. Hi, Ma. What the hell are you doing here? Get down. What's goin' on? What you bring the girl for? You told me to watch her. I didn't wanna leave her up there alone. Alright, give me that. What's goin' on? Givin' a surprise party. Hey, Gutshall! I got a present for you! Go get 'em, daddy. Whoo! Everybody sing it. Change pipes. * For he's a jolly good fellow for he's a jolly good fellow * * Which nobody can deny * * Which nobody can deny * * Which nobody can deny * * Which nobody can deny * * Which nobody can deny * * Which nobody can deny * * He's a jolly good fellow for he's a jolly good fellow * * For he's a jolly good fellow * Stop! No-o! No, dad, wait. Stop! Stop! Elspeth! Mummy! Mummy. Daddy... Skylar? Are you coming? If Elsbeth dies, then... I'm gonna kill one of you. He gets me first. What do you mean, gets you? You know as well as I do. Well, you don't have to take that from him. Oh, Skylar. You don't! Sure, I do. Well, why? 'Cause the goddamn horses were mine. The horse that killed Lyda Jo... was mine. Did you shoot her? - How do I know? - Answer me. What difference does it make? Skylar, you go up to the Gutshall's to see how she is. Daddy. You know that's not what this is about. You shut your mouth. You crazy son of a bitch. They oughta lock you up. Oh, ho, daddy. Oh, come on, daddy. You can do better than that. Get up. Leave him alone, golly, I really mean it... You crazy bastard. Stich him up. Zack? Yeah? Thrush is dead. Daddy killed him. Alright, I'll be right down. You oughta get out of here. While you got a chance. There's a pretty place near the meadow. We'll bury her there. Come on, we're ready. I always tried not to have favorites with my boys but he was born first. He was good with horses. That's because he respected them. You have to have respect for things. You have to stand up for what you love. And that's where I failed. Maybe I failed with all my boys. But with Thrush, it was many. What you did to him that night, that was many things. You killed that boy when you killed his horses. He never was the same. Lyda Jo, she never loved you the way Thrush did. He worshipped the ground you walked on. From this day on till the day you die... You don't exist for me. You just don't exist. I don't think I can make on my own now. That's what I thought when Lyda Jo died. The days go by, life sucks you in. Not me... I can't do it. I can't do it. You don't die of grief. You know, you think you will. But you don't. Leave me alone, will you? Yeah, alright. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Count them. Let me finish loading my grenades, Ludie. Looks like she got two thousand, for whole life, and... Five more for her accidental death. Now what in the world could a person be doing to lose one foot? Or the sight of one eye? They'll pay a nickel for kneecaps. I knew a man once smashed both his kneecaps when a tractor fell on him. What're you gonna do with the money, Pap? You gonna buy another station wagon? I don't think Feathers got their premiums paid up. Ludie, what the hell are you doin'? We're in it now, Zeb. It's an eye for an eye. Don't give me any of that Bible shit. Then why don't you just keep out of it. Well, since when are you in charge? Can't you see how it's all gonna turn out? It's not gonna just be the Feathers. Hell they'll probably pay more for a foot and an eye than they do for human life. Man! Old Rubin got off cheap. At least I've got one son I can be proud of. Ninety-two, Ludie. Load 'em. Here's some water? It's the first time I'm holding hands with a nice girl. Lyda Jo never held my hand. Lyda Jo did pretty much what she wanted. You got somethin' goin' with Zack? You stay with him. Get him out of here. See, uh... We weren't always like this. 'Cause they have a lot of love for our dear. A lot of love. I got great brothers. Daddy just, uh... He just... Just went out of his mind when she died... You know? He just went straight down. And everybody went down with him. - Alright. Where are the others? - At the house. Are they comin' over here? How soon? I don't know. Ludie's gone crazy. He's gonna kill Hawk. I didn't have to come up here? Yeah, that's what I've been thinking, man. - Oh, shit. It's just a gesture. - Sit down here. - Just a simple gest... - Sit down! I'm gonna get some rope. Jesus. Yeah, he is gone, baby. Sit down! Hey, man. What do you think we oughta do? - Get the sheriff. - Shut up! Do what he says, Zack, he's right. - Yeah, Zack, let me... - You shut up! I'll go. Roonie? You wanna go? There's still time. Okay. Well, I didn't set him up for it. I swear to God, I didn't. Oh, Jesus! What'd you that for? That was our chance to hold 'em, mama. Laban Feather... I want to talk to you. Daddy? Tell him I'm busy. He's busy. What do you want? Just send the girl out, and we will call it even. Got a deal? Send Madonna outside. They won't hurt her. You better answer him. Well, how do I know that's all you want? You have my word. What about Ludie's word? My boys do what I tell... I gotta have quiet! Well, get in your room, old man. What? You heard what I said. Send her out. No, let me go. That's what they really want. Look, I may have to talk to her it's her decision. - You're not gonna go... - I'm cool, mama. I don't wanna talk to you, Zack. I wanna talk to your daddy. Well, he don't wanna talk to you! Hey, Zack! Where's Skylar? He went off with Zeb! That's funny. I didn't see him! You will! Quit stalling, Feather, and send the girl out. Yeah! And-and Hawk! - Zack, if that's the only one... - No. Let me do it, Zack. Come on, man. I'm dead either way. You decided yet, Feather? Chickie, will you tell this idiot to let me go out? Now you just lie down. Let me put your feet up. Hey, Feather, what are you waiting for? Spring? You don't have to do that. I know I don't have to... Get back here. And you're not going out there. Will you look at that Goddamn thing? Look at it. Christ. Please let me go out in style. Okay. No, leave him alone! You want my pistol? Hmm? What the hell for? Just give me my good jacket. Okay. Here you go, bubba. Come on. Ladies and gentlemen... We're proud to announce that we have a hero here... First, the one and the only... Well known... Straight from... Ladies and gentlemen...
