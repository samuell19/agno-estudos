- Which deodorant do you use? - What? Which deodorant do you use? Do you like it? Who do you think I wore it for? What did you just say? Are you flirting with me, Rizwan? Are you? Wait. Wait... Wait for me... Give me one as well. The ride was, what do I say... hmmm... Why? Didn't you enjoy it? I just thought... What did you think? - Never mind. - Come on, tell me. Forget it. You'll feel bad. - Don't you know how to smoke? - Of course I do. He has taught you wrong. You know about Chandni and Alam, right? You miss him, don't you? Rizwan. Stop it, Rizwan. - Let go of my hand! - Alia. Alia! Listen to me. Listen... wait... Don't follow me, Rizwan. Listen to me. - I made a mistake. - Go to hell. You guys are all the same! Let's talk about something else. I mean... you can ask me the next question... I'll answer that. But I won't answer this one. I had already told you about this. Fine. Since you insist... It's your choice. It's a free country. So I guess, it's over. Alright then. Nice meeting you. Best wishes. We are live, sir. Yes, but I've not come here to get insulted. [people talking] I'm a man of honor and dignity and I respect you as well. You are Maya Menon and that's why I'm here but I'm not ready to answer your silly questions. Take this mic off, someone! Okay, so this is how it's going to be... Fine! I'm not running away, I'll sit right here. I'm not leaving. How much time do we have left? 20 minutes? Alright. You can sit comfortably. So will I. It's okay. 'Justice Gulati, thank you for this outspoken interview.' 'While the answers can be silent, the questions will never be.' 'Like, share and subscribe to our channel.' 'Take care and stay safe.' Coffee? Was that necessary, Maya? That man-- I love this portion. Yeah. Nice. Hi, this is Ayush. Today I will teach you... Hi, this is Ayush. Today I will teach you... Granny. What? Hi, this is Ayush. What? Granny! - Come on, what did I do? - You're looking into the camera. - No, I was just... - You were. Carry on with what you were doing. 'Ayush, what's happening? I can see everything, you know.' Mamma, Granny is disturbing me. 'Go on, go ahead and complain to your mother.' How many times have I told you, Ayush... no fighting with Granny and don't throw the ball when she's around, okay? 'Mamma, I'm not throwing, I'm spinning it.' Oh! So you're Hardik Pandya? 'Mamma, I'm Krunal.' 'And don't act smart, okay. I have 700 followers.' Wow! Where are they? Are they waiting for you at the door? Do your 700 followers know that you haven't been to school in six months? And don't give me your surgery excuse again, okay. - 'Yeah, boring. Boring.' - I'm boring you? - Have you taken a bath, Ayush? - 'Yes.' Very good. Physiotherapy? 'I don't like it, but done.' Okay, so now homework time. Go on, tell her. He brushed me off when I told him to finish it. - I didn't. - Oh yes, you did. Ayush. 'Tell her that your daddy is coming tomorrow.' - 'They plan to go to the beach. - Wait, let me tell...' Oh, your 'weekly-once Daddy'! Are you sure he's coming tomorrow? You don't need to go to the beach with him. I'll take you, this weekend. 'You never take me.' I promise I will, Ayush. Ma, I'll be late tonight. I have to finalize a story. 'No problem.' Okay, bye. Krunal, good night. Bye. Bye, goodnight. And ask Ruksana to stay back. Superb! Bad mood? Joke? The elephant joke? It drowned! Mummy, I'm quitting from tomorrow. But why? I had asked Ayush to finish his homework but he didn't. His mother asked him about it... and now I'll be blamed! So what do you plan to do from tomorrow? Nothing much. I'll go to Neetu. Who is Neetu? Remember my Alia's superstar boyfriend Ranbir Kapoor? - Oh no, not again! - Yes, again! She had called me yesterday. Asked me, 'Where are you nowadays, Ruks? Come over.' I told her I couldn't because I'm very busy. I have to cook for Ayush... I have to supervise his studies... But what's the point of all this? Ayush doesn't even listen to what I say. Mummy, I think it's best if I work there. [people talking] - Salaam, Salim. - Salaam. I can't go, Mummy. I have to complete my homework. Why don't you call this boy? Why don't you study here? I can't sleep in the AC. I can't concentrate. - What do you mean? - I can't focus, Mummy. Why did you leave it for the last minute? Don't nag me now. Let me finish studying else I'll fail. What's that supposed to mean! Focus on your studies. And send Imad over here, with Daddy. Put me on speaker. You're on speaker. - Is Daddy there? - Yes. - Listen... drop Imad over here. - Sure. And Alia, I'm sending your dinner with Tanuja aunty. Make sure you lock the door properly... - and don't be on the phone for too long. - Okay, fine. Bye. [TV news] - What are you staring at? - I know everything! If you give me a chocolate, I won't rat you out. Yes? Vinod-ji, you can leave. I'll be working till late. Madam, I hope you remember that tomorrow... I won't come to work. No problem. Leave the keys. I'll take a taxi. - Okay, madam. - Thank you. You can leave. Why are you waiting? I'm okay. Boss, I have work. By the way, I have a question. Are you related to Justice Gulati from your father's side of the family, or your mother's? You could have moved on. Really. I wanted to ask him a question and I did. It's my job. You know, just because you're a journalist, you think you can get away with anything... grill people with all sorts of uncomfortable questions? Poor thing, that man. Look at him. He's trending. He'll curse you for this. Not fair. If it's so unfair, don't work with me. Come on, I had promised him... no uncomfortable questions. I'll look like a fool! That's so true. Really. And there's nothing like a wrong question, Amar Malhotra. Like - what's your plan for the weekend? Tanuja, the food is ready. Come and pick it up. And... tomorrow morning, remember to store water in buckets for me as well. Don't forget, like you did last time. - Mummy. - Hm? Can I get a fork? Fork. [video game sounds] - Does this remote even work? - It does. My hand hurts. A ball hit me yesterday. Cricket? Yes, I'm the captain, bro. I scored 50 runs yesterday. You? Yes. 66 not out. Will you call me the next time you're playing? You can't bat, bowl or field. What will you do there? Circus? Hey, you better behave yourself. Apologize. - It's okay. - No it's not, Ayush. Sorry. Say it like you mean it. Sorry. Now say, 'love you.' Love you. Love you, bro. 'What time are we meeting?' Tanu aunty, you can leave. Don't worry. - I have a lot of studying to do. - Are you sure? Play it from the previous segment. 'Climate change is now an undeniable fact of our lives. The--' Stop. You know what, we'll rework this tomorrow. Okay. [radio playing] Sorry. I saw the light on, that's why I... Anything I can get you? No. Go back to sleep. Casualty? - Casualty-- - On the left. Salim Mohammad! What happened? - Oh! - Out! Out! - No, no that's not out. I wasn't ready. - Out! - No way. - You're out. - Bat? - Yes. - You're out. - Out? Did you see that? And the batsman's mummy makes a grand entry into the stadium. Here comes the most difficult ball. It's a wide ball. Hi, Mamma. I was here at 8 a.m. sharp! I've become super punctual. Okay, Ayush. Ready? Ready for my googly, Ayush? They've been at it since morning... 'Howzat! Howzat!' You should ask him to come over everyday. We'll pay him for overtime. His wife has called four times already. He saved her number as 'Babu'! So, Ayush... All well, Maya? Howzat! Yes! I forgot to mention, Ruksana won't come to work today. She said something about the hospital... She sent a voice message, but I couldn't hear it. Come here, dude. Let's click a selfie, for your 700 followers. Yes. Smile. 'Maya, you've killed it. Amazing!' 'Gulati is trending. This is big.' 'Let's celebrate this.' 'Hi, Maya. 12 p.m. - you have a team assessment meeting.' '2 p.m. - you have to sit with Amar on the U.P. election tour.' '4:30 p.m. - you have to interact with the subscribers.' [people talking] Is it waterproof? Yes, sir. - Warranty? - Yes, sir. More. You look tired. Sir. Late night? - When is the wedding? - Next month. The groom works in a software company in U.S.A... in Colorado. Where? In Colorado. Oh, that's nice. So after retirement, you'll be holidaying in... Colorado! I will be there. I was saying... Sir, his daughter is also getting married... First, you mess up. Then I get a letter from my superiors who side with you. The suspension stays! He was feeding cake to the accused, wasn't he? I have the video. Shall I show it to your son-in-law? Sir, overlook his mistake. Forgive him just this once, please. More, you'll be retiring in a month. Isn't it? Why are you ruining your reputation? You have my respect, maintain it. What was she doing there at 3 a.m.? Who was she with? I don't know. I was working a night shift. - What do you do? - I work in films as a spot-boy. - And your wife? - She was also at work, sir. - Does she also work in films? - No, she works as a cook. G7 apartment... madam Maya Menon... - the news anchor... - Yes. My wife works as a maid in her house. - Does she have a lover? - No, sir. I don't know. Did you scold or hit her? No, sir. Never. Then why? I don't know how this... She told us that she had to study. Here, drink some water. You. No school today? No. Why? I'm a little stressed. - Want some cream biscuits? - No. Come on, take one. Take it. Namaste. - Don't run away from home again. - I won't. - Listen to your parents. - I will. Take a photograph. Come here. Come. Where exactly did this happen? Sir... the road in front of Baratanki Post Office... it took place at a spot ahead on the left. I watched your show last night. Very good. That Gulati is a thug of the first order. A bloody thief! I read all about it on our Good Morning chat group. He has three bungalows. The one on a hill station even has a swimming pool. See, I also wanted to be a journalist. But I'm very honest, you know. Very tough for honest people. I think I should go to the police, Amar. I'll tell them... she just came out of nowhere. And I just had a sip. I wasn't drunk. And will they believe you? You know how dirty all this can get. You haven't received a call or anything yet, right? Do you think anyone saw you there? I don't know. How bad do you think it is? I don't know, Amar. I don't know. I might have killed her, Amar. Ayush... It was an accident, Maya. It could've happened to anyone. I wish you hadn't fled. You should have called me. You were sleeping. You were knocked out. Yes, Ma. All ok? [people talking] Thanks. I was sleeping. She was found on the road, in this condition. A street vendor brought her to the hospital in a rickshaw. I should have forced her to come over last night. She said she couldn't concentraâ€” [blabbers] She said, she can't focus in the AC. Madam, look how they've carelessly cut her hair. She'll be so upset when she sees it. Yes, Ma. Yes. I am with Ruksana. I'll call you later. Go to sleep. Has Ayush eaten his dinner? Do you need any help? Woodstone Hospital. May I help you? Her full name? Alia Mohammad. Age? She will be 19 in August. - May I borrow a pen, please? - Yes. Sure. Thank you. She will be in the ICU tonight. Under observation. She'll probably be shifted to the room tomorrow. Do you want something to eat, Ruksana? The bathroom is fully functional. There is a shower, geyser, bucket... 24 hour water supply... on some days. Did you see the room? Well-ventilated and naturally cool. You don't need an AC. Your bed and cupboard will fit here perfectly. You can even keep a table over here. Hi, Pinky. - Jai Jinendra, Uncle. - Jai Jinendra! - All good? - All good. She is Rohini George... a reporter. - Journalist. - A journalist? Ok. Meet Uncle and Aunty. Uncle is hard of hearing. It's good in a way, isn't it? They are good people, just like family. They will stay here. They sleep in the drawing room. You girls can sleep in the bedroom. Ok? Ask him to wait for me. How can you show him the apartment? I have the keys... Hey, wait up... Shanti Sadan, this building is very famous in this area. - Should I confirm? - I don't like it, Ruby. My mother will be here next month, from Kochi. Where will she sleep? With Uncle and Aunty? This is the best you'll get within your budget. I had told Jacob about this earlier. Jacob said you had connections. Of course I do. Then work something out. He said there's a one-bedroom apartment. There is a one-bedroom apartment. But you can't rent it. You can't afford the deposit amount. Ask Uncle to finalize the deal for 20 thousand. How much? 20 thousand. Wait, Ruby. Let's discuss this over a cup of tea. - Treat Jacob to tea. - Coffee, then? - Today is Sunday... I don't want coffee. - Listen to me. Wait, Ruby! Good. I'll take care of it. 'Woodstone Hospital' I am Pradeep Kamble, from K.M. Nagar Police Station. I thought I'd come and meet you. Uncle Qureshi who lives in Pydhonie... he told me... you are like family... This is a good hospital. Your daughter will get the best care here. What is the cost per day? I don't know, sir. Maya madam is taking care of the expenses. Don't call me sir. So... how did this happen? Shouldn't you be the one telling us, sir? Please leave the room for two minutes. You are like a brother to me. I didn't say much in front of your wife. To some extent, it is our fault. That area is not safe. Why was our girl there? Sir, did you manage to get any CCTV footage? We're looking into it. But two days have passed since the accident. Even if we find the driver now, nothing will show up in the blood report. Now what? I mean... what do we do? I'll tell you. Call me if you need anything. And don't tell anyone that I was here. There's a process... you know. Bye. See you later. Who is this Uncle Qureshi? I have no idea. Why did you even entertain him? He is trying to manipulate us. Threatening and scaring us. - I didn't entertain him. - Oh really? Forget it, Salim... Our daughter was out on the streets late at night... So? Did she deserve to get run over? She was studying. The light was on. Maya madam is already doing so much for us, I don't want to add to it. Else, I would've spoken to her about this. You need to get these medicines. Yes, Rohini. Tell me, Maya Menon is your boss, isn't she? Ok. Are you coming to the hostel this evening? Ok, I need to talk to you about something. I'll call you later, bye. Hello? [song playing on the radio] Go for it. Good shot! Javed bhai... - What? - I want to go home. Why? Just like that... I want to go. Know what, this place is your home now. Say you want to go to your village My mother is unwell, bhai. You said she died last year. Er... she is like my mother, my aunt. You don't look sad. Come on, cry and show us how sad you are. Alam has gone 'home', once he returns you can go... 'home'. Square your shoulders a little bit. Lovely. Beautiful. Chin down. I don't have all day, guys. We're figuring it out, just give me 15 minutes. We've been doing this for two hours now. Why don't you tell me what you want and we can wrap this up. Confidence. Ok, Maya, I think we need a little more confidence. Show me how. Can you stand like this? Sit. - I'm ok, ma'am. - Sit down. Yeah? I'm extremely sorry to disturb you, ma'am but I wanted to tell you personally... Er, maybe you know... that hit-and-run case involving your maid's daughter... I've got a tip that the police are trying to quash the case. It seems like a high-profile case. Who told you this? My source. - Whose team do you work in? - Huh? Whose team do you work in? J.D. sir. But I thought I should tell you first. You were busy. I told him... He said that it's a false lead but I still wanted to tell you, so he said, 'you only tell her. ' Alright. Can I work on this story? Please, ma'am. I won't let you down. Let me think about it. Ma'am, I have more leads. First, share what you have. But I don't have your number... Why did she come to you, Amar? You should leave, Maya. I might say something that you won't like. And I don't want all that mess, please. Are you hiding something from me? Huh? I have a meeting. I'm getting late. I'll be right there. Chill. You could've told her that you'd tell me about it, isn't it? But no, you made me meet her. Why? Because you wanted to see me like that. Like what? Like... what will the 'oh-so-ethical Maya' do now? Maya, unlike you - I'm uncomplicated. If I hadn't told you about it, you would've asked me why I hadn't. Please leave, Maya. How do you know her, Amar? She's a trainee, Maya. Tell me, why did you tell her, 'I will think. ' All you had to tell her was, 'your source is wrong. ' That's it. Maya, you know where this trail leads to, right? It leads to you! This 'I'm so clean' act of yours, is really stupid. Don't you dare call me stupid! And you know what, you're right. Let's not talk. You ran over somebody, Maya. And now you want to investigate it. This is not a film. It's real life. I won't throw everything away because of what you did. If you want to throw it all away, go ahead, don't drag me into it. Now go to that girl, take a selfie, post it and make sure you tag her. Then you're done! 'I've got a tip.' 'You know where this trail leads to, right?' 'I just had a sip. I wasn't drunk.' Maya, I think we got it. I think all you need to do is look a little off-camera, that's it. 'I'll take care of it.' Chin down. Chin down. 'I have more leads.' 'You ran over somebody, Maya.' [song playing on the phone] Mummy, Maya Menon is following Rohini George. Mummy, Maya Menon is following... I'm going to the police station directly. You complete your shopping. - Prakash More sir? - Yes? I'm Rohini George. I'm a journalist with WRD, the online news portal. Did you see anything in the CCTV footage, sir? - It's not working. - Huh? The CCTV is not working. How? How? It's a cheap Chinese gadget, it's not working. So you don't have any leads? Even if I do, I'll tell the concerned family first. Not some random reporter. Protocols. - Do you want something? - No. Hey, how much do I have to pay? For the two of us? Sir, I... I haven't done an independent story yet, sir. It's a golden chance for me. If I crack this case, before my probation, I'll create a good impression on my seniors. Hey, return the change. They will also increase my salary. I want to get my mother here, sir. At present she lives with my sister and my brother-in-law has a drinking problem. He is physically abusive, sir. Please. Give me one tip. I will not name you. The victim is my boss Maya Menon's maid's daughter. One tip, sir. Please. No comments. Hi, my name is Shubham. My brother Sameer met with an accident... Spinal cord injury. His brother is the victim of a hit-and-run, just like your daughter. He is collecting money over the internet... crowd funding. You're lucky that madam is paying for everything. I just can't believe it. I sent her a message last week. I couldn't remember Kareena's son's name and she instantly replied saying it's Taimur. And look at her now! I don't allow these two to even go to the mall. I've told them to ask me if they want anything, isn't it? I'll get it for them. Unlike others we take pride in educating our daughters? Don't we Ruksana? Sadly, Alia will lose out on an academic year now. Rosy, Daisy, go and sit over there with Imad. Go on. Actually, my husband was asking... why was Alia out so late in the night? The nurse is calling me. Imad... 'As you can see, there is water everywhere... ' 'Bad mood?' 'Joke?' 'An elephant jumped into a swimming pool' 'and all the ants came out.' 'One ant climbed onto the elephant's back.' 'Then all the ants started shouting-' - 'Drown the bugger!' - Drown him! 'Don't worry. I'll come, Ruks. Promise.' Bye. Er, hello... Alia's mother? I am Rohini George. I work with Maya Menon. I want to meet you. 'The consistent occurrence of natural calamities,' 'seasonal shifts and persistent heat waves' 'all point to one simple truth-' 'The clock is ticking on Mother Earth and we need to take a stand.' 'A stand that goes beyond mere words, statements or debates.' 'And awareness can no longer... ' Why weren't you receiving my calls? I was trying to reach you. Oh, I didn't notice. Have you seen Gulati's post? He wants another interview. But look, if you don't want to... it's ok, no stress. You can always ask Rekha to do it. I'm sure she'll do a good job, isn't it? Now, Ayush, no TV, no games. - Straight to sleep, ok? - Ok, Granny. You didn't tell me you're coming early. Ayush, go wash up. I've got Thai food. No, Ma. I don't want to eat. Fine, I'll throw the food away. He can eat it tomorrow. I'll keep it in the refrigerator. You should have told me that you're getting food. That girl Rohini, from your office. She had come to the hospital. She got some sandwiches and this boy gobbled them-- Throw it, Ma! You ok? Why did you take him to the hospital? What do you mean? He had promised Ruksana. - So after his physiotherapy-- - Why wasn't I informed? We were there for only 10 minutes. That's not the point. Now the driver will inform me about it, is it? He did, didn't he? - Then what's the problem? - Why did you have to go? I told you. He had promised her. But you have brains, don't you? You took him to a hospital. What if he catches some infection? He won't catch any infection. He's a soldier's grandson! And don't worry, he hasn't got his intelligence from me! You are over-protective of him. Where are you going? Maya! You wanted to eat right now, didn't you? Fine. Let's eat. Ayush! Come out. Your mother wants to eat this food right now. - Throw it, Ma. - I won't. - Ma, throw it. - I won't throw it. - I said, throw it, Ma. - Have you gone crazy, Maya? You have a problem with me, right? Fine. Let me just throw it away. Not done, Maya. Maya, don't you dare walk out on me. Rohini. - Yes, ma'am? - Where were you yesterday? I got a lead about Alia's boyfriend-- I... So I went to meet Ruksana... Did I give you my approval to work on the story? What did I say? - I'll think! - Ma'am, I... Stop working on the story right now. You won't be able to handle it. Your sources are all bogus anyway. - No, ma'am-- - It's not ma'am, it's Maya. I spoke to Ruksana and there's no truth to what you're saying. Don't bullshit me! They can't do this at the last minute. Where's your leg? Bhoiwada? - Didn't I ask you to keep your leg up? - Sorry, sir. What the hell is he doing? Hands behind your back. Show me. You'll break your leg if you do this. Keep it down. Now put the bribe in his hand. Now keep the other leg on that. What are the doctors saying? How is our girl doing? They said it will take time, sir. But she is conscious now. She's conscious? Good, everything will be fine. How much do you earn per day? 1800 rupees. You know what, Salim... Don't pursue the case. Accept the settlement. Even if we nab the driver... The maximum punishment is six months. What's most important is our girl survived. Luck. What do you say, More? I speak from experience... this is how these things usually pan out. They are influential people. They'll find a topnotch lawyer to represent them. What will you do then? That's why my advice is, to guard our own interests... that's it. But you need to decide quickly. The faster we resolve such matters, the better it is for everyone. What do you say? Don't mention this to anyone... the matter might get complicated... Is there anyone called Alam here? - Who is Alam over here? - Over here, Aunty. I am Alam. What do you want? Hey! Aunty! You're the one who called Alia there, didn't you? Aunty, I don't know who took her there. - Don't hit me! - You were with Alia... - I have no idea, I was with my friends-- - She's in the hospital! What's going on? Let him go. Why are you hitting him? Calm down. - I swear, I don't know. - Let him go. We broke up a while back. Who the hell are you? Are you his father? - Keep quiet. - Go inside. Shut up! Call your father. I want to speak to him right now! Go inside. Boys like you are ruining our girls. She was studying at home! It's all because of the evil eye... I won't be able to go, Mummy. I have a lot of homework to complete. You know what, Ruksana... we should agree to this settlement and return to our village. Should we discuss it with Maya madam? But they said not to talk to anyone about this. What do you think? It will... take three days to get the car repaired. They won't give us a receipt, madam. I... need five lakh rupees. I found this stuck on the bonnet of the other car. What do you want? Hello... Hello, Rohini... - What's wrong, my dear? - Nothing, Ma. All well? All your sources are bogus. Where is Rekha? I need that document right now. - I'm well. - Where is it? How is your golfing going? Ok, a little slow though. I had a ligament tear. Anyway, these days I seem to be the ball... getting putted around. A little birdie told me this. How are you feeling now? All good? Yes. How's the family? Last we met was at Rahul's wedding, isn't it? Correct... all ok. - You're good? - Yes. Nice. - Let's meet over lunch. - Ok. 'Hello...' 'Maya, sorry to disturb you.' 'I know it's my fault... but my source is not bogus.' 'By tonight I will get the CCTV footage from a nearby shop.' 'I will hand it over to you and stop my work on this story.' 'I promise.' 'Sorry to let you down. Sorry.' Ok. Let's go! 3... 2... 1... Hi, this is Maya Menon on yet another episode of 'Straight Talk'. Last week we had with us retired Mr... 'By tonight I will get the CCTV footage from a nearby shop.' Justice. Sorry, can I take it again? Hi, this is Maya Menon on yet another episode of 'Straight Talk'. Last week we had with us retired Justice, er... 'I will hand it over to you...' Justice Gulati. Anand, will you take care of Ayush, if something happens to me? Well, legally you've proven that I can't, so... Maybe I can't. I am joking. I've saved enough for him and that remains his. Are you dying or something? Huh? You've learned Russian? Medlena. Medlena. You know that I'm a little slow. Maya? Are you ok? One second, the kid is crying. Sorry. What's wrong? Come here. Come to Papa. 25! Have you lost your mind? What is this? A game show? Let's go, More sir. I was trying to help because we know you. I'll tell Qureshi sir... Who is this Qureshi? Look, Salim, we're here to help you. We are not going to gain anything from this. So help us then. Tell me who was behind the wheel. That's what you're getting paid for, aren't you? They are good people, that's why they're offering you money. We are policemen. We haven't come here to bargain. Who started this? Fine, file a case... and fight a never-ending battle in court. To hell with the settlement. Let's hope you get justice one day. Let's go, More sir. Wait, Pradeep... don't get offended. Please sit. She doesn't mean this... she's very worried... Please say something, More sir. You should take whatever you're getting. Else they might get an expensive lawyer to fight you. What then? You'll end up disgraced and broke. Let me speak to Maya madam about this. Do you really plan to tell madam about this? Yeah, yeah. Don't worry. Yes, I'll take care of it. Maya is fine. She is good. Just tell him not to mess with me, that's all. Ok, bye. [Ayush singing] Ayush... Ayush. Ayush. ...my sandal broke. - Anand, Ayush's school... - Why are you arguing? Our neighbor Mr. Gulati lives in our apartment complex. ...my sandal broke. Mr. Gulati lives in our apartment complex and you're arguing... Ma. Where is Ayush? Ayush? Ayush. Has Ayush eaten his dinner? Ok, be careful. Yeah, I'll go myself. And keep singing. Yeah, yeah. [Ayush singing] Our singer seems very happy today. [Ayush singing] Er, do you have lose change for 2,000 rupees? Ruksana is coming over. Why is she coming here? And why wasn't I informed? I didn't know either. She called me and said that she wanted to meet Ayush. But she's coming from a hospital. We've discussed this, Ma. Ayush might catch an infection. Maya... I don't have the energy to get into a fight with you. Stay back, if you want to. Has the Alia Mohammad case been settled, Uncle? - Chutney? - I don't want any! Who told you that I am here? Huh? I have nothing to tell you. Why are you following me around? Just let it go. How old are you? You have your whole life ahead of you. There will be many other cases... Do you want money? Want me to do something? Why are you after me? Just like you, I'm very worried. I have seen the CCTV footage. 'On the night of the accident...' 'Pradeep insisted on a retirement party -' 'He kept insisting.' Look, there's a snake peeping out, kill it. Kill it. - Look, there's a snake. Kill it. - Who is that? Who is shouting? Is it you? Climb down. Climb down! Who gave you permission to put this up? Same person who gave you permission to piss! I'm a cop, you idiot. I'm a cop. Hey... - Hey, what are you doing? - Munna... Let him go. You can't beat up a cop, Munna. Stop it. I'll put all of you behind bars. No way... I'll put all of you behind bars. - Sir, something for you... - What is this? No way... Just keep it. To hell with permission, I'll piss anywhere I want! More... You rascal! Lift it... More... cops can get away with anything... 'The accident took place on that road, an hour after we left.' 'The next day, the girl's father came to register a complaint.' 'When I saw the CCTV footage...' 'I froze.' Check the footage of the accident. 'My daughter is getting married next month.' More... If the wedding gets called off... I swear, I'll hang myself. More... In the video, you're just taking a bribe but in my case, I've made a fool of myself! I have a sincere request to you. Please don't tell anyone about that CCTV. What about the investigation into the accident? I got scared. The CCTV at the next crossing doesn't fall in our jurisdiction. There would be an Inquiry against me if I investigated the case any further. My career of thirty years is completely blemish-free... I take pride in my uniform. We were simply trying to find a solution... they are also poor... the victim's family. We tried to help them out. So you're the ones who offered money to Ruksana? It was Raju. What is this? CCTV. - And what is this? - Daddy's banner. And what happened right there? The accident. Who do you think will go to jail? Which fool puts up a banner in front of a CCTV? Daddy is contesting in the next municipal elections, isn't he? You're in for some big trouble... It's Daddy's birthday next week... So I thought... I'd put up a big banner. One on this side and one on the other side. And another behind it. - And who's going to watch your 'behind'? - Sir... if Daddy finds out... he will scold me a lot. Why don't we... settle? How much will it cost? - 15. - 20. 15. 25. 35 lakhs. I don't understand... who is Ramnik bhai? He is Raju's father. When I was your age... I used to fill hot tar into drums and put it on roads. I used to be paid 50 paisa after constructing a kilometer long road. How much? - 50. - 50. To earn 35 lakhs, I'll have to build a road to Uranus! You messed it up. Didn't you? You asked for 20, isn't it? Let's seal the deal at 10 and then you get lost. I'll throw in a couple of drums as well. Leave. Ok, as you say, bhai. We'll inform the victim's parents. But don't ask for our help if there's a problem in the future. Your drums will be of no use then. Let's go. Anyway, happy birthday in advance. Daddy. Daddy! My daughter is getting married next month. I'm carrying the wedding invites with me. She will move to Colorado, USA. I beg you... please don't pursue this case. The deal will be finalized today, please don't do... 'I beg you... please don't pursue this case. Please.' One minute. Wait. What do you mean '10 lakhs'? I tried to get more, Ruksana, but... And you agreed? They refused to budge, said no... They have to pay us 25. 'The number you are trying to call is currently unavailable.' Study. - Are you studying or wasting time? - Wasting time. - Do you want coffee? - No. The insurance company called. They keep pestering us. Madam, Alia is slowly recovering. She is much better now. The doctor said that she will soon start talking. Good. What should I make for dessert? Ask Mummy. I'll get you coffee. Ruks, say hi. Not now, Ayush. Later. Say hi now. Hold on. Hello... er, Ruksana. Hold on. Ask for 12 at least. Just get it over and done with, Salim. I'll try but you... - Ayush. - I'll speak to you later. Are you ok? What is this, Ayush? - Have you hurt yourself? - No. - What are you doing, Ayush? - I... it fell. Why did you do this? Now don't move. Ayush, I had told you not to mess around in the kitchen. - Are you ok? - Yes. Look at what you've done. - Sorry, Ruks. - What do you mean sorry? Luckily it was sauce. What if it was hot oil? You would've gotten hurt. Not that one, madam. I'll do it-- Why are you scolding him? Who was the one who left the stove on? The stove was off, Madam. I had turned it off. No you didn't. I turned it off. I had turned it off, madam. Don't lie, Ruksana. The stove was on. And what was so urgent? The... Let it be. The insurance company had called that's why I stepped out for two minutes. I told Ayush... Who is the child here? Him or you? You should be more careful. - Madam, I... - Don't argue, Ruksana. Just leave. - It's just a bottle of sauce, Maya. - Ma! - It's not her fault. - Ayush, stop! - Let's go, Ayush. - It wasn't her fault. What did I do that was so wrong, madam? There are various kinds of infections in hospitals, aren't there? You just stay with Alia and look after her. Call me if you need money. And don't come back unless I ask you to. It's not her fault, Mamma. Do you get that? - ... not her fault. - Ayush. It wasn't her fault, Mamma. Fine, I'll leave. The stove was off, madam. Pick it up, Ayush. No. I said, pick it up, Ayush. Maya. Maya, he is wrong. Ayush, say sorry. No. - Ayush, say-- - Ma, don't interfere. - Pick it up, Ayush. - Maya. - No. No. No. - Pick it up, Ayush. No. No. No. You're weird. - I'm weird? - Yes. - I'm weird? - Yes. - Do you know what is weird? - Maya. - Maya! - You're the reason I'm-- You have the Devil's luck, Maya. That girl Rohini had come to me. Confused. She didn't know how to handle the story. I told her... nowadays it makes more sense to cover up stories. She didn't ask for much... 2 lakh 20 thousand. She needed the money to pay the deposit for an apartment. Her mom is coming, so... Luckily, she's your fan. And don't worry... I told her, I'm the one who took the call to remove her from the story. I'm the dirty business guy. You can thank me later. This guy definitely has some past-life connection with you. Idiot. - We were worrying unnecessarily. - Does Ruksana know? No. Wait. Wait up... Get out. Get out! Alam bhai, what did I do? Didi... Didi. Didi. Didi. She is saying thank you. I want to thank you as well. Aunty. Aunty! You were blaming me... - This is the guy... - Alam bhai... This scoundrel was with her that night. Alam bhai! Come on, tell her. Come on, tell her. Aunty, after Alam and Alia broke up... we got close... She wanted to get more followers, Aunty. She said she wanted to go on a ride. I was scared, Aunty. Forgive me, Aunty. Please forgive me. Can you recognize who did it? I was scared, Aunty. Can you recognize the person? You know what, I am weird. I told you. I know. I am sorry. I am sorry. It's ok, Ma. It's ok. - I am really really sorry. - It's ok. Don't cry. I am sorry. 25. What do you want? Nothing. Can I finish my coffee? Or again you'll say 'why wasn't I informed?' [Murli - good morning.] [Vasu - hi, good morning.] [Mohan - good morning, all.] [Smita...] [good morning.] [Supriya - good morning!] [Arnav - hi, guys, good morning.] [Srikrishna - good morning.] Look who is back. Maya Menon #MM. So what's the plan? I am thinking of resigning. - Are you mad? - No, I'm serious. You know, everyone did his or her best. Now it's my time. What do you plan to do? I'll go to jail. Maya, don't tell me you've run over somebody else now. I saw you coming. Come. Come. No, Ayush. Is Granny at home? She is. Come in, Ruks. Please. Not mozzarella, madam doesn't like it. Send cheddar. And send the same brand of Basmati you did the last time. I want to talk to you. Finish cooking and then we'll sit and talk. I guess this is your mother in your DP. Yes, ma'am. When is she arriving? Next week. Is your apartment sorted? 2 lakh 20 thousand sorted? I'm sorry, Rohini. I'm sorry for you. There is a story that needs to be finished... and it's urgent. Get working on it right away. Superb. How is Ranbir's girlfriend now? The stove was on. We don't have to do this right now, Maya. You don't look too well. You haven't eaten anything. Drink some tea. I've added ginger to it. Drink it. Why are you so upset? You know how Maya is... short-tempered. The 'daal' is delicious. You cook well when you are angry. So you won't talk to me. We've done so much for you... Haven't we always treated you like family? And you want to leave now. Have you thought about what will happen to Ayush? What do you mean you want to return our money? Suddenly, you are too big for us? Join work from tomorrow. Can I take Ayush to the beach? 'Ruksana has been working at my place for the last three years.' And she makes the best food in the world. She knows everything about Ayush's routine. When he had surgery, she tied a sacred thread around his wrist. She puts up with all his tantrums... more patiently than I do. He's always saying - Ruks this and Ruks that... Ruks, Ruks - all the time. She was his Ruk's daughter. I didn't know how she looked. Why did you flee? Fear. Gulati's curse, I guess. 'I had promised to take Ayush to the beach.' He hadn't been to school for six months, after his surgery. How would he go to the beach? 'The number you are calling is currently switched off.' 'It was a special day.' Gulati's interview went viral. I fell asleep at the wheel. She just came out of... I looked back and saw that she was in a pool of blood. I left her bleeding. I left her to die... Nobody would know if you hadn't spoken about it. There's a problem... I know it. Ruks. Ruks... Does Alia's mother know? Yes, Ma. I've been trying to call you for so long. Ruksana has left a lot of money at our place. What? Ayush has gone to the beach with Ruksana. Neither of them are receiving my calls. 'The number you are trying to call is currently switched off.' 'The number you are trying to call is currently switched off.' What's happening? Vinod-ji, get the car out from here. Tell them. Let our car pass. Let our car pass. Please. I am in a hurry. It is urgent. Vinod-ji... Vinod-ji... Ayush. Ayush! Ayu-- Ayush. [Ayush singing] - [Ayush singing] - [Imad singing] Let's remix the song. - Once more. - Sure. - [Ayush singing] - [Imad singing] Let's take it from the top.
