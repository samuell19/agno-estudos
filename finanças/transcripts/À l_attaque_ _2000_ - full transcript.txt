He's fucking asleep. He doesn't get bored. So we look for work, and he snores. That's how he works. But no, he's not sleeping, he's working. But yes, he cuts, he arranges. He feeds on his own dreams. He marinates. He sails. As Flaubert would say. So, did you marinate? Nobody came? Are you waiting for someone? I fucking dreamed they were all there, the actors, the crew. They were demonstrating outside the door to write a film for them. That's what we're supposed to do. We don't write under pressure. I don't make a film to give people work. I'm not an employer. We can't work like this. Under pressure. But what pressure, you just slept for 3 hours. Do you want a coffee? You're nice. A film is not an end in itself, damn it. It's a means, a way to- Wait. Drink your coffee first. Thanks. You know, Marivaux, he wrote something like, "If we were less concerned with making great things, there would be more masterpieces." So what? So nothing. I'm just saying that, for nothing. You know, there's an interesting movie idea in the paper. The girl, she's 20 years old. Her brothers have been raping her around since she was 13. She can't even remember how many pregnancies she's had. Her brothers, as they went along, they would throw the babies in a pit or in a garden, like here. Maybe we could make a comedy out of it. Fuck, yeah, it's pretty fucking gay. Is there any coffee left? Oh fuck. What if we wrote a political film. Precise. And assumed as such. Precise, I tell you. Well, a political film, that is. You know what a political film is. No, I don't know, I'm too stupid. Do you have any Princes? In the drawer there. A political film. It's a film, about the relationships, between the rich and the poor. The poor? Oh fuck. Here. Ciao, Giuseppe! Dad, dad... You think I'm not capable of putting him to sleep. How often do you put him to sleep? Hey, shut up. In any case we can see the result. What result? We're all completely stunned, that's what. Ah, maybe you're stunned but in any case you're all bad children. You bet! Don't you have anything more cheerful? So what? Without sadness there would be no love. Lola! But what is this again? Here, take Giuseppe. I love you to death, Lola. You make me suffer so much, Lola. That my heart doesn't beat anymore, Lola. And I'm on perfusion, Lola. In the doctor's arms, Lola. I'm waiting with all my heart, Lola. A heart transplant, Lola. Give me your heart, give me your heart, Oh, Lola. Shut up! I don't know how the neighbors put up with us. But because they love you too. Listen to them. What's the matter, Jean-Do? Come here, a little. Do you want me to jump? So I can better see your legs! Look, what was I saying, all stunned, even the cousin! You are too beautiful. If that's what you're saying... Come on, a little compliment from time to time, it doesn't hurt. 10 times a day, yes. But 10 times is not enough. You, it's every minute that passes, every second, where you are beautiful. What do you want from me, Jean-Do? Shanghai 280 we can't find it, we don't know where it is. How many hours will you work? Me, I have my account, I fall, I'm going to bed. We too, we bring in the cars, but we can't find the 280 of Shanghai. He must have picked it up this afternoon, but ask Marthe. Good night. You are beautiful like a mermaid. Except that mermaids, they don't have as beautiful legs as you. That's right. Go to bed. Shangaï, 280, did he get it back ? Yeah, this afternoon. I've been looking for it for three hours. And how long are you still working ? Because me, since this morning at 7 o'clock, stuck here, I don't know anymore where the chair ends and where my ass begins. Gigi, he took it. What? Shanghai, 280, he took it. I told you. Well, I'm going to finish this one and go to bed. Should I close? Don't turn off the sign, eh. I know. Well, I'm going upstairs. Shit. There you go. One day more. Or less. And tomorrow morning, up at 6 o'clock. I'm not complaining, it's not that. Anyway, we don't have the right to complain. Ivan ? Adds "With all the unemployed there are." With all the unemployed people out there. That's all you think about. How long has it been since we had sex? That's not true. There's more to life than ass. You didn't always say that. Come on, let's go. Let go of me, let go of me. If I don't have sex with my husband, then who do I have sex with? What do you say? Nothing. I think it's a great start. There's movement, there's humor. Huh? Is there anything that bothers you? Are you going to tell me why he doesn't want to make love to her? I don't know, I'm tired. She's tired too, isn't she? Well, I'll reverse it, if you like. He wants to and she doesn't. No, that's not the problem. Slobbery? Yes. Because there is already a problem? Defense and illustration of the monogamous French Catholic family. Bourgeois, in fact. Slobbery? Oh, are you deaf? Yes, I told you. Why, aren't you monogamous? Aren't you Catholic? You're not making a movie about me, are you? What kind of stupid name is, Jean-Do? And Jean-Do, Jean-Do for Jean-Dominique. He's the cousin. The son of the sister of Pépé Moliterno. When his father and mother died... Stop, stop, it's already embarrassing me. No, I'm telling you this to explain to you why he doesn't have a dago name like the others. Well, except Martha, because she is Jiji's wife. Gigi. Gigi, not Jiji ! Well, I said slobbering, but that's not a reason to spit in it. But wait, you can't stay just in the family. You have to open up. The family refers to the fatherland. What you have to do is talk about the world. We need to broaden. Take over for me, you'll see. What are you doing? I'm broadening. You think that all you have to do is put two young people in to make a young people's film. Why don't you put an old man in, The elderly also go to the movies. An old man, how? As much as being on a Solex. If you really want to widen, you should also put a Turk, an Arab, a black. The young man is Mouloud, an Arab. And what is she? Swedish? Vanessa? Nothing in particular. She's a student at the Beaux-Arts to make a bit more money, she poses naked for the others. Don't you think you're widening a bit too much, there? Of young people? Young people from the neighborhood. In the time of sea urchins, they sell sea urchins In the time of flowers, they sell flowers. There you go. And when there are no sea urchins or flowers? I don't know, anything. Panties, sardines. In any case, the film takes place during the school vacations. But yes, but sea urchins aren't picked up in summer. And who knows that? I do. Do they sleep together? Anyway, when we go to the markets, we have to get up very early. By sleeping there, he saves time. They've known each other since they were kids with the Moliterno family. Mouloud's whole family went back to their country, they were undocumented migrants, so you understand. Ah no, no, no, no, no, not the undocumented ones. No, no. But what did you do there, did you eat the whole omelette? Well, OK. That's for the poor. And the rich? In conclusion, the average profit rate of Euro Conteneur is too low, consequently, the filing of bankruptcy is necessary Yes, but the accounts remain balanced. All balances end up slipping. Invest in another company of the group to make losses. See the best solution By closing here and creating Euro Container in Morocco, we multiply our results in the sector, by five, in the first instance. And then, we have to help the developing countries. And the employees? 73% are over 55 years old. the State will assume. We pay enough of social charges. Don't you think so? Euro Conteneur France is dead. Long live Euro Conteneur Maroc. The Crédit marseillais, Mr. Moreau, as usual, is admiring. You're going to make me blush. Any other questions? Perfect, perfect. We're going to celebrate. Do you like sea urchins? For me, it's the seafood that I prefer. Iodine makes your blood boil. Sea urchins, eat the sea urchins, it's proletarian. Yellow, green, beautiful flowers, beautiful flowers! Eat sea urchins, it's good! Yellow, green, beautiful flowers! Sea urchins, eat sea urchins. Beautiful flowers, beautiful flowers. Eat sea urchins, it's proletarian. That's the relationship. Maybe it's the relationship, it's certainly not the relationship. What relationship? The relationship between the rich and the poor. But no, sea urchins are just a geo-gastronomic link. Geo-gastronomic. Yes, geo for Marseille and gastronomic... But I don't care! I want class reports now. Ah yes, boss. OK, boss. Class reports, here and there. I heard that the Chinese have invented a self-cleaning engine like ovens, you see, no oil change, no maintenance. Impeccable. Yeah. That way you'll get more work, moron. I'm sorry, I talked to the boss about it but... Taxes, drafts, supplies how do I pay for them? Tell me. Come on, tell me. We'll eat your ice cream and get paid on St. Clair's Day. I know, I know, but what else can I tell you? And how am I holding up? It's not his fault. We never turned down the job. So fuck it, it's always for nothing. Come on. You can't! Ladies and gentlemen, good morning. Moliterno garage. You can see that we are in a meeting. You owe us three months' back pay. We're the ones who maintain the trucks and the forklifts. Yes, that's fine. You owe us three months. Yes, yes. Listen, you're in a bad time, I'm in the middle of a union meeting. You're not forgotten, but if I don't pay the Urssaf, the VAT, it's the company that closes and if the company closes, do you know what happens? I fire everyone and I don't pay anyone. That's what happens. So, please, have a little patience. A little civic-mindedness. You're not alone. Selfishness is no longer the norm. A selfish society is a society that is on its way to ruin. That's why the Chinese are stronger than us. More competitive. We need to stick together for the sake of everyone. You, them, me. You think you're the only ones with a problem? Do you think that the head of a company like this one, which is just the tip of the iceberg, a company of international stature, you think I'm free of worries, that life is rosy for me, every day? Why did you contain yourself? You wanted to beat the shit out of them, you chickened out. They're good at containing us, that's what they do, contain us. So we don't come to work until they pay us. We'll see how they fill their containers with shit, when the machines don't run anymore. We'll see. Hello, Mr. Shanghai. Aren't they here? No, is there a problem? Do you know anything about it? Are you a mechanic? I'd rather be Mr. Moliterno. Come on, speed up. What was that? The arrival of the cum that was hurting. It's all right now. It's vulgar, that. So? So what? Well, aren't you going? Go fuck yourself, You're insisting, here. Poor is not synonymous with vulgar. But it's an expression from Marseille, that's said all the time, for a yes or a no. It's picturesque. Fuck you, fuck you, it's not vulgar. Go fuck yourself, it's not vulgar? Say by you, yes. So? So what? So you're not going? Well, what's going on there? I can't think of anything better than "Go fuck yourself." Well then, put it back. Fuck you! Are you in love with my sister? Lola, do you love her? But she's my cousin. You know, I loved Nicolas very much. He was more than a brother-in-law, he was a friend for a long time, but he's no longer there. And my sister needs another man. She doesn't like me. Did she tell you? These are things that are said without words. Do you want me to advance you the money for the whores? Roll. Roll, I tell you! Damn it, you're not going to make me! You always want to order! Oh, don't yell ! You're a pain in the ass with your whores. You're all alone, your wife left you. That's what a whore is for, right ? What? Why are you looking at me the wrong way? Your wife left you. What does that mean? Nothing. I'm fine. I went there once. It was centuries ago. I couldn't get any more with Marthe, no more inspiration, nothing. I wasn't going to go and see a sexologist, was I? I had a whore. One? Because you think we'd only go once, you? Where did you see that? And now you're cured. What? With Martha, are you okay? Well, I'm fine... So, shall we go together? Hello, children, What good wind brings you here? She speaks while singing. That's funny. You too have started, me too, but what got into me? You have just entered the enchanted brothel, where you can have sex at your ease. We are pretty fairies, the pretty blowjobs. In bed, we do, everything from the floor to the ceiling. They are the fairies, the pretty blowjobs. They do everything better than at home. Enter, pay, fuck. That's the motto. You know what Roger Vailland said? "In the theater as in sexuality, true amateurs prefer professionals." We're a little short, though. It'll be okay, it'll be okay, we'll get by. Note, even rich people sometimes they have problems at the end of the month, so you think, us. Who are you talking to? Can't you knock before entering? I know who you're talking to. Oh yeah? And who do you want me to talk to? Are you coming, Martha? Yeah, I'm coming. Give me your eyes, Lola. Mine got punctured, Lola. Looking at your breasts, Lola. Give me your eyes, give me your eyes, oh, Lola. Are you coming like this? Don't you like me? Anyway, it's not me that he wants to see. Where are you going like that, girls? To the bank. Ah, this one's just right. Henri the slacker. The one who never works. He's going to accompany you. Are you all right, Henri? But who is this Henri? Don't you think there are enough characters,? Let's put up a sign like in the silent era. Well, the garage was his, well, his father's. Henri has never been a workaholic. When his father died, he sold the Moliterno garage. Since then, he hasn't worked anymore. He invests all the money, and it brings him a small 4000 francs per month. He is content with that. But what is this Henri for? To show that the dominant model is not necessarily the example to follow. Henri claims the right to laziness and to non-consumption. Aren't we getting a little off topic,? Hi, Henri! Hello company. Here, since you have nothing else to do accompany Lola and Marthe to the bank. But who says I have nothing else to do? What else would you have to do? You walk around all day, walk around with them. It will be a useful walk for once. Why? Are we going to be attacked by Indians? Gigi's right, you never know. Let's go, ladies. I got an idea. You're scaring me. Why don't we have a thing between Martha and Henri? You're not coming with me? No, here. I'll wait for you outside. You know, Martha, women, you know, I've known some women. Well, every time, you tell yourself that after you've thrown your coin into her well of love, that woman, you love her a little more than the others. I always hoped that she would have made a wish. And that this wish... Well, it's the same. The same as what? The same as mine. That the woman's wish and the man's wish are the same. A vow of love, and all that. That we're going to live together, what. When we have children. You know about children, I don't really count on them anymore. Don't panic, we won't... We won't... We won't hold a knife to your throat. It's not the house style. Thank you, sir. But we should make a gesture. I mean, in relation to the management, you have to prove your good will. Three months, okay, we'll have you settled by then. No, three months is what you should pay By, say, a fortnight. Really? You'd be more than three months late, three months is negotiable. Yes, yes. But if not, they'll slap me on the wrist. You know that the regional manager of Crédit Marseillais is a very... Three months, does that seem possible to you? Three months, okay, we'll pay. Do you know what will happen if you don't pay? Are you all right? Yes, he was very happy. What about the rest? What about it? There are still several months of delay, right? No, but it's okay. He said it was fine. Shall we go? Yeah, let's go. You know, Lola... The others, they'd be okay with it, for both of us. You know what I mean? Yes. And you'd be okay with that? You know, Jean-Do. Yes, I know, but you know... Well, it doesn't hurt to ask. I was thinking during the day, I understand that you... But then, when the night comes. Yes, I know. It's the same for you. Yes. What's up? Listen, Jean-Do, just because I'm lonely... doesn't mean I want to spend my nights with you. I'm grateful. But you know I can't. No, I don't know. I don't know anything. What I do know is that we're all alone, each on his own, and that we'd be less alone together, that's what I know. You're right. Ah! Yes, but I don't feel alone because I'm alone, do you understand? It's because he's not here anymore. It's not a man I need, it's my husband. So you're going to be alone all your life? I think so. But still... Look, Jean-Do, I've known you since I was a little girl. We used to play doctor, daddy, mommy and we were barely 5 years old. So, now, if I were to sleep with you, today. Do you understand? No. If I imagine you naked, it's like you were when you were five. Do you understand? Still not. You may have changed Jean-Do, but for me you've kept the same willy, that's it. But no. I know you haven't. But how can you imagine me with a 3 cm willy? That's how it is. No, it's not like that. But even at 5 years old, it was more than 3 cm. It's not a matter of centimeters. But that's all you talk to me about. But no. But no, not but no. You just told me that my dick was still tiny. But no, I told you that... What the hell, it would be 30 cm, what would it change? What the hell, 27 cm more, you ask me? You're not in bed yet? I'm going, I'm tired. And you? Me, no. You're going out? You're beautiful. Good night, Jean-Do. Where are you going? Why? Do you need permission? No, but... Where are you going? I'm taking the tow truck. But... See you tomorrow. What are you doing here, you're not in bed yet? Do you know where she's going? I know where I'm going, me, and you too, for that matter. Come on, come to bed. Come on, come on. Shit! Don't you want to take off your cane? I'm going to break an ankle, me one day. Are you doing it on purpose or what, old nutcase. Yes, I'm doing it on purpose. So that you wake me up. And does it amuse you? No, it doesn't amuse me. I like it. That way I know when you're coming home and when you come home I'm not alone anymore. Yeah, that's it. Good night. Jean-Do. Jean-Do. Are you crying? Why would I cry? Even today, we're working like ants that would have eaten a rabid lion and for what? For nothing. We're both sleeping in the same room. Good night. Good night, Jean-Do. Who's that with Lola? Her lover. Yes, thank you, I see. But does he have a name and a role to play in the story? Apart from fucking her, you mean? Yes. No, nothing, he's fucking her. Is he fucking her like that? They met on the beach, and he's fucking her? Are you joking or what? No, I'm not joking. Her husband's dead, so fuck it. She's still in the prime of life. She's got to get her chimney swept from time to time, right? Huh? A chimney sweep? And you're going to put that in the dialogue? Yes. I even think we need a little more of it. A little more of what? Of perversion, that's lacking in perversion. I could see her wanting not to fuck her cousin. I could see her going to give blowjobs to soldiers in the shithouse of the St. Pierre station. Saint-Charles. It's modernity. Characters can't be monolithic. Lola's perversion removes all Manicheism. She becomes complex, like you, like me, like all of us. The nonsense of the world, Xavier! Oh fuck. What does that mean, "modern"? And if I believe, me today, that being modern, means making things clearer? I don't have the right to want, me to see good people on one side and rich people on the other? Like in the puppet show? Do you know what it means "to be modern"? It's to do something right and legitimate in the moment when we did it. There you go, being modern. Don't take the fly. Soldiers will get blowjobs from someone else. Mouloud, are you coming for a ride? Mouloud. I'm working. What? What is it? The penal code. To sell sea urchins? What for? Judge. Judge? Who wants to be a judge? Do you know many Arab judges? Oh, note, it's not common. What's wrong with all of them wanting to work. Do you think I'm unhappy, not working? No, but I look unhappy? I don't know what's wrong with all of them wanting to work? Not everyone has the means to hang around all day. Wait, wait. If all the guys who have a little nest egg like me, Wait, wait, if they all settled for as little as I do and stopped working, fuck, there'd be no more unemployment. We should encourage people who have savings, inheritance, lottery winners, I don't know, me. We should force them not to work and I swear, overnight, the unemployment curve, it's Jean-Do's willy at 5 years old. Why do you say that? Me? What did Lola tell you? Nothing. But priming is priming. What is Jean-Do saying? What priming? I don't know what he's talking about. And Marthe, are you still fucking her? What about Marthe? Oh, Jean-Do, he's talking to me about Marthe What's the matter, Marthe? We've been sleeping together for 20 years. What did you just say to me about Marthe? You take the fly. I don't take anything, I don't take the fly. What fly? The fly. But what are you doing, stop. Go fuck yourself. But stop! Fucking beautiful. Henri, the gland. What do you want to say about Marthe? Are you interested in your relationship? What do you want that I tell you? What do you want to know? How do we do it? How many times a week? How many times a night, is that it? Wait, but you're irascible, Gigi. I was in a gym. Gym teacher. I would have liked that, a gym teacher. It's got really muscular limbs a gym teacher. But let her talk. It took you 3 hours to tell us about a 30-second virginity session. He was 70 years old. Yeah, he wasn't a gym teacher. That's for sure. Neither was I. What was his name, this kid? Cindy. Cindy? Do you realize that there are people who call their son Cindy? Shut up. But what? You're silly, shut up. I would have liked to see your face if I had called Giuseppe, Marie-Claire or Brigitte. Giuseppe isn't a girl. No! Yes. You don't mean to say that you... But no. Shit! Since when you don't fuck her anymore, Marthe? And you, since when you try to fuck her? Since I know her. But I don't hide it. What? She's a woman who deserves better. I'm not up to it? Sorry, I didn't mean that. It's okay. She deserves to be loved. I meant that. To be loved every day, every hour. She doesn't deserve indifference. She's a wonderful woman. Look! Look, damn it! Oh, my God, when they run, there's a lot to do. It's been a long time since a woman has run like that towards me. What are you doing? But they're coming! They're coming! But what are we missing? What's wrong with this fat bastard ogling me,? Well, he's not that fat. Do you think I've made a mistake? He's the kind of fish that touches, but never bites. Stop it. He's the bank manager, with all the money we owe him. If you want, I'll fix you up. Hello ladies. I wasn't sure I recognized you. We recognized you right away. You know Martha. Hello. And this is Vanessa. Nice to meet you. It's hot. They're white, I'm going to spend often at the beach. Yes, it's fragile. Goodbye ladies, goodbye ladies, goodbye gentlemen. And good afternoon. Don't you think we talk a lot about sex? There are only two things important in life. Class struggle and sexuality. The big bad wolf, that he is small, that he is big, that he is strong, He blows on the cities and the cities out of straw, they fall. Marignane, Toulon, Orange and the little pigs they are crunched. Yes, and the little red Riding Hood also, crunched. That one, do you think she is worth better than the wolves? She has forgotten everything. She has forgotten that she applauded Mussolini, that she entered Rome, that she voted for Hitler in 33, that she knelt to kiss Franco's foot when he made his coup d'état. And what did that get her? Misery. Fear. Hate. Death. And then? He told you again his stories of war to give you nightmares? Well yes, if I die, who will tell him? He's six months old, he has time to learn. Precisely, it seems that it's at that age that one retains the best. That, I trust you. But who's that again? Mrs. Manade. Manade? Henri's mother. But what's she doing here? Cleaning, it's obvious. Unlike her son, she can't stand not working. So she gives a hand, she does the cleaning. But they can't afford a cleaning lady, they're poor. But they don't pay her, she does it for nothing. And what use is that to us? In the story, what is she telling us? Listen, it's Mathilde Girard who could play it. Mathilde ? But she's already the matron in the brothel. We fired the sequence, we have to find her something else. We can't let her down. Shall I go on or what? Do you want a coffee? No. Let's go on, we'll see. And why wouldn't Nicolas have liked that? All men like that. He liked me the way I was. That too will have to be shaved. Oh no, listen, the legs at a pinch, that's fine, but not that. But I assure you that it's done. To go to the restaurant? You're so stupid. You never know what might happen after the restaurant. I know, nothing will happen. Well, if you go with that mentality, then, sure, it's over. I go to the restaurant to eat. I don't go with a mentality. You're the one who has a mentality in the back of your head. In life, you always have to be ready for anything. At the worst and at the best, you have to never let yourself be taken for a ride. If that's the way it is, I'll phone and cancel. Come on, don't be silly. Go ahead, shave. Come on! Come on. Don't come in! It's me. Dad, don't come in. What are you doing in the kitchen? Leave us alone, Grandpa, it's a secret. For our wedding anniversary with my husband, we were treating ourselves to a pizza in a pizzeria in l'Estaque. We couldn't afford a restaurant like that. It's been a long time since he... That he died? Yes. Too long. I was seven months pregnant. I almost lost him. Where are you from? Me? No, I mean, are you from here? Where do you want me to be from? No, of course not, but you can also be from somewhere else. No, I was born in l'Estaque. I was born on a boat. Are you kidding? My father was vice-president of the Credit populaire agricole in Tonkin. Just before Diên Biên Phu, my mother was repatriated to France before arriving in Marseilles by leaving the Suez Canal, off the coast of Greece. The sea, got a little rough. My mother had a very strong seasickness, but it wasn't seasickness, it was me. With a little advance. What is your son's name? Giuseppe. Like my father. And you? I don't even know your first name. Niels. Niels? But I could have been Greek, if I had wanted to. Like Protis. Do you know Gyptis and Protis? It was two thousand six hundred years ago. Ah no, I don't know then. Me, I... I am a bit like Protis. And you... You, you are... Gyptis, wild woman. But no kidding, they don't have a penny. and here you write that they're going to drink champagne. What, champagne? There, you see? You wrote "champagne". Don't piss me off, now. We're on a roll now! The characters exist. Champagne, not champagne, we don't give a damn. Here we go, we've got them, we've got them there. Come on, let's celebrate. How stupid you are. So? How far did you go? To the restaurant and then to the beach. To the beach? That's beautiful, that's romantic. It rained. That's beautiful, but then how far did it go? How far did what go? You finished when it rained, or it rained while... What what? You didn't do it to yourself. That's not true. You didn't do it to yourself, did you? You didn't go all the way? What? Since Nicolas died, you haven't met a single man. So what? It doesn't stop me from breathing. Don't you like the banker? Yes, he's not bad, he's nice. Well then, jump on him. I don't know, rip off his fly Would you do that? You know, before Nicolas, I didn't know many. Then until I was 20, putting my tongue in, it disgusted me. I used to count 5 and then stop. For a long time I couldn't go over five. Just now in the car, you forgot to count So what? Is he a good kisser? I don't know. Anyway, while he was kissing me, I couldn't stop thinking about Nicolas. It's not nice for him, but I couldn't help it. Are you sure that... A little blowjob at the Saint-Pierre- Saint-Charles station, moron. Work. I lied to Martha. I didn't think about you all the time. Instead of yawning you'd better eat. I don't yawn. I filter. Like the whales. I'm looking for a breath of courage. I've never heard so much bullshit so early in the morning. It's not bullshit, it's like this that the whales do to eat the shrimps. Damn, it's not 7 o'clock yet, it's already making me dizzy. We're talking about shrimp and if you could take your shower before breakfast it would be nice for the others. Where is he again, that lazy of Jean-Do? At Euro Container. Shit! I said we weren't going there anymore until they paid what they owe us. They called, they've got three broken down. I said we weren't going there anymore. I'm talking about the flies? How much do they owe us? Tell me how much they owe us to make me* Go ahead, look in your ribs. No need, they owe us the last five months. The last five months? That's not true, you put it in. You're the one who wanted an old man in a Solex. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Damn, we invented the fuel injection engine, the electric engine, the gas engine, the atomic engine. Not to mention the Chinese engines and do you still drive with that? I'm doing fine. And yet, I'm older than him. You leave it to me until tomorrow. Stay still. You're nice Adolphe, aren't you, you let me work. Stay still. Stay still. There he is. I'll take a wrench, I'll go there and I'll smash their faces in. Where the hell have you been, for fuck's sake? I said we weren't going back there anymore. Shit! It's always the same who get fucked. Because with three broken down machines, they'll pay us faster. That's not true. You're always out of touch, my poor Jean-Do. Mechanic is like doctor! A doctor, when there's a patient, he doesn't care if the guy has money or not, he treats. And have you ever seen a single doctor unemployed? What did they tell you? I couldn't finish, there was a piece missing. When we go back, they write us a check. At all? They said a check. I'm not responsible, Lola I'm sorry. The management refuses beyond a certain threshold. It's not directed at you personally. These are national guidelines. What about me? What about my son? Excuse me? Are we responsible? No. Then who is responsible? The regional director, the management from Paris or elsewhere, tell me who I can talk to? I would like to be able to help you, I would like to be able to help you, Lola. But I don't know what to do. But no, you don't want to help me at all, you want to stay on your ass in your chair. This bank has lost billions in America and in Holland and we are going to be thrown out for 125,000 francs, fuck you. Lola! Come on. I'll do everything I can, I swear. I'll call, I'll help you, I'll help you. I won't let them. Are we moving forward or what? Judicial liquidation? What does that mean? I was at the bank, it's not going well at all, we're four months behind on the payments. The bank has decided to put the walls of the garage up for sale. They can't. Yes they can. As long as we haven't paid off the loan, the garage belongs to them. If they put it up for sale? Either the buyer keeps us and we become tenants. It would hurt us, damn it, if he already had his ass so big. Or he doesn't keep us, and all that's left is to leave. Like that? Yes, like that. We have to pay them. And what do we pay them with, Mouloud? With what Euro Container owes us. If Euro Container pays us back, we'll barely get by, but we'll get by. They'll pay, I swear it. I'm going to set fire to their warehouse, it's not going to take long. And what are they going to pay us back with, if you burn everything down? I don't know. Gigi. Jean-Do. Euro Container is in receivership. What does that mean? It means... It means that a liquidator has been appointed to sell the company under the best conditions. What it means is that once again we have just been screwed. If they sell you will get your money. No, because first we pay the creditors known as privileged, the tax authorities, the URSSAF, etc. Then the employees. The suppliers like you, last. And in general, they don't get anything because the fine doesn't cover the totality of the debts. And that bum who runs to fix their machine as soon as they call. It's okay, you're pissing me off. I'm pissing me off. I'm going to kill him, their boss. If we're going to die, he's going to die along with us. Bravo, Gigi. Oh, shut up, Gigi. I'm the one who always shuts up. It's okay. You're right. Tomorrow I'll go and make them the foot kiss. You're not going to bed? Yes, we are. Don't stay there, it won't make any difference. We're coming. Good night. Good night. Good night. Fuck. Quiet, guy. What is this? Who are you? What do you want? What do we want? Who are we? Don't you recognize us? We want our money. Are you sleeping peacefully, like this naturally, or are you taking something? Are we being robbed? We're being robbed. Maybe it could happen to you if you always leave everything open. But we're not thieves. We want our money, Madam, not yours. Only ours. Money. Yes, the money that your Tuesday owes us and that he doesn't want to give us. My wife is not concerned, It's none of her business. That's a nice bed. Excuse me? That's a bed, I know about beds. Because my wife wanted to buy one. So we went to all the stores, we tried all the models, even one like this, but we took a model below, but well below. On credit. Did you take out a credit too? No. It's better when you can afford it. You see, ma'am, this bed is our work. You're sleeping on our backs. I don't get it. Euro Conteneur is in receivership. It's the law, it's legal. It's the liquidator who will pay you your due. It's no longer in my power. It was, in your power. But you let us marinate in the brine. You knew that you were going to liquidate everything. What do you want? The money you owe us. We've already told you. I'm sure that just a painting like that, is worth more than enough to pay us. How much is it worth? It's a fake, it's an imitation what do you think? We can't afford to pay for master paintings. Master paintings are for masters. That's Estaque, did you see that? That's where we live. The garage is there. We live in a masterpiece. In painting, we're worth millions. But in fact, we're in the dirt. In everyday life, what are we worth? How much does he owe us? 125,000 francs. I'm sure it's worth 100 times that much, It's an imitation. It's in the museum, the original. How much did you pay for it? I don't know anymore. You bet. Just a poster, it's worth 100 bucks. So a reproduction of this quality, it's worth how much? 100,000, 150,000? Come on, give me a high five. Let's take the canvas, and you don't owe us anything more. No, you can't. Why? If it's an imitation. Where's all this going to get you, this trespassing, this home invasion? If you think you're going to solve your problems this way, you're very naive, my friends. Not friends, you say not friends! We're not friends. My friends are like me, they sleep in rotten beds. They don't wear silk pajamas. They don't order anybody around. Stop it Jean-Do, stop talking. They always win in the end, those ones, with words. But not this time. You're going to pay us everything that you owe us! And paying means all the money, the money you understand? The tickets. Not talk. Not promises, tickets! 125,000 francs in bills. 125,000 francs in bills! Stop! The phone! Stop shouting, you'll wake up everyone! But you are deaf, the telephone! But let's go. Since the time I've been telling them to pull a line to you. Hello? Yes. No, it's not my husband, it's my brother. You stay there. But who's that coming to bother us at this hour? What's wrong? What's wrong? Has something happened to them? The police. But speak up, what's the matter? They're in prison. They tried to rob Euro Container and the manager filed a complaint. Oh, the idiots, the idiots. I'm going, you stay here. It's all over now. They're going to take the garage. And we'll have nowhere to go. Grandpa Moliterno is going to end up in the hospice. He'll be better off because we'll have nothing. They're going to take my Giuseppe. Shit, help me Nicolas. Help me. Don't let them do that, help me. Otherwise we'll have fought for nothing. For nothing. Not if you fight again. Nicolas? Oh, Dad. I thought he was back. I heard you talking to him. I thought I was going to see him again, too. And no, Dad. You know, Lola, I'll tell you what. He who has never fallen, he will never win. Our oxygen is the mud. What can we do? I have two plans. The first one... I am very touched by this invitation, Lola. You consider this restaurant, in some ways, to be a sanctuary. This is where you used to come with your husband. Yes. I am very flattered, really very flattered. Very touched by the symbolism of this invitation. Would you agree to be my wife, Lola? The garage? Your bank is going to steal it from us. It's not my bank, Lola. Yes, but it's my garage. We've sacrificed everything for it. I know that, Lola. No, you don't. At the entrance to the garage there's a piece of wall that's missing. It's me one day, moving a car, who ran into it backwards. And this scratch is more important to me than anything else. But you don't understand. Everyone in the neighborhood knows us. It's my brother who fixes the bikes of kids and the strollers of mothers. Yes, I understand. It's touching. Touching? No, it's not touching, Niels. This garage was my husband's idea. He cared about it more than anything, more than his own pride. He was even the one who insisted that his name should not appear on the sign. Just "and company". I understand, Lola. If you want to help us, it's now, Niels. Of course, Lola. How? How, I don't know Lola. What do you want me to do? Find 125,000 francs. But that's impossible. Give us a loan. You're not creditworthy. Make it out to your name. I can't. I'll get a slap on the wrist. Please shut up. Shut up. This is a bad idea, this invitation. You don't belong here. But on the contrary, if you are to become my wife, it is only right that we share our lives. No. Excuse me? I'm answering your marriage proposal. No? Yes. Lola. You can't do anything for me, Niels, nothing for us, nothing. We don't come from the same neighborhood. What does the neighborhood have to do with a love story? We don't come from the same world. It's not a question of social class, Lola. It's not a question of struggle. We're not in a struggle. It's that I'm expressing myself badly. Explain yourself, Lola, it's important for me. Please. I love you. Don't laugh at me, please. I'm not laughing, Niels. But you know, these stories of social class, of proletariat, all that, of rich people, I don't understand anything. What I do know is that we don't live on the same planet. We don't breathe the same air, both of us. In the evening when I go out on the balcony, to get some fresh air. It's not the same city as you that I see, it's not the same moon. You know, it's like in those science fiction stories, two parallel worlds. From time to time they pass each other like trains. But it doesn't last. It doesn't last. No. Your train goes that way, mine goes that way. I proposed to you, Lola. Yes, I know. That's nice. Thanks. What's up? Plan number 2. That's good. Who are you? Do you want money? I like you. But I'm twice your age. Only? I have one flaw, can you guess what it is? No, I really can't see. I'm a gerontophile. I love old people. Come. Where are you taking me? Don't you like surprises? It's very rude what you're doing. Excuse me. If your hands itch, find another occupation. Kiss me. What does that mean? You're crazy, you're completely crazy. What do you expect, what do you want from me? You? Nothing. You'll get nothing, you'll get nothing, not a penny, you hear me. The law is for me. The law is for me. And you'll end up in prison. The other two, wasn't that enough for you? Here we are in the Republic. And you don't kidnap someone with impunity. That's right, with impunity. Listen to me, my boy. Oh you listen to me! In 22, 1922, on October 28, 1922. At the side of the Duce, I entered Rome with impunity. In 24. In 24, under the orders of the Duce, I participated in the elimination of his enemies, with impunity. In 36, I took Ethiopia. He was two years old. In 38, Albania, and I massacred populations, with impunity. I shot opponents, intellectuals beaten with rifle butts, women and children simply because they were Jews. Impunity. Do what he says, please. And my Solex? And for kidnapping a boss, what does it say, the penal code? Up to 10 years firm. They're going to put me in the same cell as Gigi, do you think? He'll be out before you. Is it true that they have TV now? Yeah. And some, you know what they call them, some... Sex addicts? How did you guess? It's not hard with you. I can't sleep. Do you think they'll last? I don't know. Gigi was crying like a child. And tell me? You had sex once, didn't you? But that's all you think about. Come on, tell me, tell me about it. Yeah, one time. In his office, after closing time. On the carpet, yeah on the carpet. Gigi never wanted to buy one. He's not wrong, it's never clean. So what's the bill? I'm hungry. Oh, it's okay. It's cold. But no, it's not cold. Anyway, it couldn't have been the two of us. How did it go the first time? Listen, Martha. Come on, tell me, don't be mean. He listens to everything, that one. Do you want me to cut off his ears? Hi. Hello, Martha. Say, do you have a quarter of an hour there by any chance? By any chance, no. No, no, I mean, not by chance. Didn't you like it last time? Did I say that? No, no. If you didn't like it, I thought that, the coin in the love pit, I'd throw another one in. If you wanted to. No, not really. Really? Are you disappointed? Well, yes. I didn't think that... Well. Does that mean never again? No, it doesn't mean that, but I don't know. If the opportunity arises, if I feel like it, if you feel like it. But I feel like it. Don't you understand? Let go of me, Henri, it's okay. We're not married. How did it feel when you felt like it and not Gigi? Didn't it twist your stomach, very hard? No, Gigi is Gigi. Damn, Martha, it hurts. I love you, Martha. Henri, I'll tell you. Our relationship is not really a love relationship. It's more of an erotic friendship. Henri is speechless. Wait, it's not only Henri who is speechless, I am too. Don't you like it? Yvan, it's a garage. Popular people, popular characters. Marthe can't say "erotic friendship." Listen, Xavier. There are two expressions popular in Marseille. The first is "Go fuck yourself." And the second is "erotic friendship." Goodbye ladies, goodbye mesdemoiselles, goodbye gentlemen and good afternoon. Sir, you're not going to believe this. What are you doing here? So are we talking or what? What do you want to talk to me about? Kidnapping. Deliver me, deliver me, deliver me! Did you get it? Yeah, it's good. Live from Estaque, in the family garage Moliterno & Cie, where Mr. Moreau, the CEO of the company d'Euro Conteneur, is held hostage by the Moliterno family. Hello. We live and work in our garage, we don't count the hours or the days. Before we borrowed to buy this garage, we couldn't find any work. Then my husband had the idea to take it over. We got a little help from the state and with a loan, we were able to buy it. Today, the bank wants to take it away from us because hasn't paid the last installments. The bank has its reasons, but it doesn't want to understand us. If we don't pay, it's not because we don't want to, but it's because Mr. Moreau of Euro Conteneur, owes us 125,000 francs and he never wanted to give them to us. Now, Euro Conteneur is put into liquidation. We are told that we will only receive our money in several months, even years, maybe. Or maybe never. But the bank doesn't want to wait for years and months, and it wants to take our garage. So my brother and my cousin went to Mr. Mouret, Moreau, to get back what he owes us. They were put in jail. His house is worth hundreds of millions. The other companies that belong to him, are doing very well. All he has to do is sell one of his cars to pay us. So I'm talking to all the people who are watching us. Who are the thieves? What we are doing is illegal. But these laws are unfair. So they are bad laws. We will not let go of Mr. Moreau until the men are freed and our money is returned. We are not bandits. But if they want to stop us, if they want to make us die, we will fight back. We'll go all the way, because we have nothing to lose. There you go. It's over. It was live from the garage Moliterno & Cie, having held Mr. Moreau, CEO of the Euro Container company, hostage. Jacques Mercandier for FR3 Marseille. Did it go through ? Yes, of course, live. All we have to do now is wait for the police. With all this hoopla, I'm surprised they're not here already. Don't go too far. There's still time, you can go back. I won't press charges, I promise. Be careful he doesn't catch a cold, with the draught. Lola. I wonder if this chair isn't making me a little tired. What are you writing? Lola's death. You're sick, aren't you? It's beautiful. No, it's lousy, get out of here. It still needs a little blood. No blood, no cops. But why? Because I don't want to. That's it. No blowjobs in the shithouse, No gunshots. You're old. Yeah, I'm old and I'm fucking with you. Well, then, they're looking out the window, dumbfounded. The whole neighborhood is there to support them. They're chanting. "We love you!" Isn't this too much? We don't have the same references. I have an idea. "The Solex!" You're too stupid, but you're right. The silent crowd watching, it's better. They're all there. There's even Henri with his mother. Does he have a mother? And company. As cut as that? So what do we do, it's a rotten one, not a rotten one? Shall we buy him back? What are we doing with this guy, then? They're all nice, except the bastard boss. It's going to be a sulpician film. Indeed, there's one who gives the blows, the other who receives them, it's white, it's black. It's Manichean, I don't give a damn. At some point, you have to be in the story. Because we need it, because I want it. Because I want to dream. And then, those who don't want to dream, well... There you are. Sorry Lola. I robbed the bank. What did you do? I robbed the bank. A daydream. A possible, plausible tale. Lola, I quit. It's not true? I'm looking for a job. Maybe I could take care of your accounting? Marthe's not really her thing, With me, you've got a specialist. I know about interesting investments. We haven't fucked for months. But that's all you think about, I promise. Didn't you think about it a little in the cabin,? No, there was Jean-Do. Why don't you ask me to dance, Jean-Do? Ah well, yes. You see, Giuseppe. Sometimes you win, and sometimes you lose. But you must never let yourself be taken for a ride, never. You must always fight. Because if you don't fight, if you let yourself go, you're sure to lose. But above all, above all. Above all, you're bored. Good evening ladies, good evening gentlemen. Now we're going to the prize you're all waiting for, for the best scenario. The Grand Prize for the best scenario of the year 2000 is awarded to... Excuse me, the envelope is a bit hard to open. The Grand Prize for the best screenplay of the year 2000 goes to... Too Manichean, not subtle enough. Well, you see if we had kept the whores at St. Peter's station. The little blowjobs. It's not because we're doing a story, that we have to be so extremist and you, you're extremist. Go fuck yourself.
