Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. CURRENT STARRING MUSIC DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY WRITTEN AND DIRECTED BY A regular orbit has no such points, so we can't talk about an absolute orbit. Brains are needed to know when to launch the second Vostok. - How lovely! - Pump some water. Go home. That's fine. 37 degrees. Almost like a fever. Come out! He heard us. Maestro. What do you pay? For such a scarecrow? I've packed Luja's things. Shall I bring them over? We'll come over by car. Coming? Take care of yourselves. Don't jump into deep water. - Aren't you listening, son? - Come on. - Hello, Aunt Anna - Hello, kids. The Tomboy? He whistled for her. She wasn't at home. Give me a bite. - What was the match like? - Off form. - Scored any goals? - Next Sunday. Maestro... The laurels! You're always joking about serious things. - What is it? - Vivaldi. If his name means anything to you. It was in the crossword puzzle. - Who was he? - A priest in Venice. He composed the first violin concerto. In the 18th century. You should deal with more serious things than crosswords. - Was that you, Berci? - Wait. Pass it on. Wait for me! Come on, kids. Head it. Look out. Watch on the left. Well done. Don't squash it. - Wasn't it a goal? - It was. Goal! Two to one. Berci, what's wrong? Don't let him deceive you. I'll tickle him. He's only pretending. Catch him! Don't let him escape. Here you are. Look. - Who is he? - I've no idea. Put the bicycles here. - Our "Golden Bank". - It's nice. It's worth the long ride. Here are the kids. Hi! - Afraid? - Terribly. - Can I help? - Yes, please. I'll introduce them. Karesz applied for the sports academy. Berci failed in the second grade. He's now a shop assistant. Gabi is a trainee biologist. He writes poems, too. Laci Kir?ly's a theoretical physicist. He won many prizes in contests. Luja's in the mud. A future sculptor. This is Zoli. He's a medical student. She's B?be. Hello, I'm Zolt?n Sz?kely.

It's fine. - Do you like Camus? - I do. - Where does he come from? - He's a new neighbour. Go away. Why have you brought him here? Head it. - The academy accepted me. - Are you happy? - Oh, yes. Don't flirt. It's goal. - May I smoke? - Of course. We don't know each other. I'm Zolt?n Sz?kely. I'm Karesz. - Where do you change? - Behind that tree. Thanks. - You have no manners. - I know. Leave me alone. No flirting. Grand! Come on! Hello, I'm Zolt?n Sz?kely. Please, sit here. - Are you the goal post? - Leave them alone. May I? Would you do my back? - Join us? - With pleasure. It looks nicely tanned already. Goal. - What's up? - Nothing. Gabi. I didn't mean it. Hey! Are you coming? - Coming? - No, not now. Come on, Doc. Leave him alone. The finest mud. It's your turn. Well, Doc? Don't be a coward! Hey, Uncle Miska! B?be! Bring the stuff! Come on, let's gather twigs. It looks great. Come on! An onion. You'll be a physicist? - When are you going to Pest? - On Tuesday. - And Gabi? - He received his paper, too. - How long will you stay? - A few days. Stop, kids. I'll take a photo. Steady! - Where's Gabi? - He must be gathering twigs. Steady. I'll go and see. Gabi! An Altix? Mine's a Zenith. - Hasn't he come back yet? - No. - He's gone home. - Why should he? - He was upset. - Why was he upset? Well... He must be hiding somewhere. To frighten us. Maybe he swam to the other bank. Where are you? Gabi, don't be silly. Gabi, don't be silly. His clothes are here. God... Do you think... Where are you going? Are you mad? Come on. You three. Search the other bank. Girls stay here. We must call the police. Wait! Take a bicycle and go into town. Listen! - I'll go. - Wait... maybe he's at home... Take his clothes. Come on. We'd better see if he's at home... Is that you, Berci? - Gabi's not home yet? - You went off together. - I... came back early... - Shall I give him a message? No, thanks. - What did you do? - Stop it. - What did you do? Let's go to the police. The waves may bring him up. Should we try farther down? The water circles here. Under the ferry boat, maybe. We'll go and see. Let's turn around. He must have got on the tug. The old man used to take us on. River police? L?szl? Kir?ly speaking. As we were swimming in the river, a tug-boat went by. Gabi may have got on it. Will you give us a ring? Thanks. Your father? Gabi must have stayed to unload the tug-boat. Without saying a word? Thank you. Have some tea. You, too, B?be. A good idea. We spent too much time in the water. Kir?ly speaking. Is that you, dad? No, she hasn't. On night duty? Both of you'll stay. A shirt for you. I'll tell her. Good night. - Hello, mum. - Dad? He wants a shirt taken over. It's his birthday tomorrow. I've bought a book on your behalf. The cancer check-ups really tired me out today. Hello. Why are you drinking that disgusting rum? Come and help. Kir?ly speaking. On my way home I heard that someone drowned. I see. Who was it? Wrong number. Go after her. To hell with her. Don't forget the shirt. Yes, but I can't find the Medical Journal. - You wanted to say something? - No, Mum... You should start packing. To avoid a rush in the last minute. Bye, children. Are you angry with me? You don't think that... Don't cry. How strange you are! I'm afraid... Leave me alone. Can't you hear me? Would you tell me why you are so upset? It's all your fault. And Tomboy's. You keep showing your muscles around. To prove your strength. You're proud. You think that being good in bed is something. You thought I'm in love with you. You're wrong. I never was. Not a bit. Now please go. You'll catch a cold. My son... Sonny.. Mother! Are you all right? Come, dear. See you. - Then? - We headed the ball. - Gabi, too? - Yes. - You? - He was in the mud. - I was reading. - Then you joined in? - Did you know Gabi before? - I met him here. You met everyone here. My father is the new caretaker. In the hospital. So you went swimming afterwards? Was it cold? Luke-warm. - You went in there? - By the tree stump. - Together? - Yes. - You, too? - I was last. - I stayed on the bank. - So you saw them. - Where were you sitting? - By the tree. Well? Zoli was the last. He called me, too. Then they played. With the ball... Diving under the water... Bringing up mud from the bottom... All of us did it in turn. All of you graduated from high school. How could you do such a stupid thing? It's 8 metres deep here. The pressure increases by one atmosphere! Understood? - Who was the first to go down? - Karcsi. The county champion. You should have known how dangerous it was! And you... Perhaps someone kicked him, or pushed him touching the bottom. Was he in a bad mood lately? Did you notice anything strange? No. And you? When did you realize that he was missing? - On the sand. - You looked for him? - On the bank and down there. - So far? The river flows at a speed of 4 kilometres. You didn't miss him earlier? I only noticed that someone was missing. I don't even remember what he looked like. I can't recall his face. - Who missed him? - Me! But why so late? Go back. It's forbidden to bathe here. Attention! Out of the water! Take your clothes. Make it snappy. I conclude: it was an accident. If we find him, you'll be informed. Bye, I have to go now. The boss is waiting for me. Karesz dived and returned with a handful of mud. He threw it to Gabi. Then Gabi dived. It was his turn. He threw the mud to me... The water is 8 metres deep there. I took a big breath and dived... I pulled myself deeper and deeper. I opened my eyes, but I couldn't see. I grasped the mud. I kicked myself up with all my strength. When I got to the surface I looked around "Kids! Gabi!" "Where is Gabi?" Hello, Laci. I still don't understand. I can't forget about it. Awful. Auntie Anna! - Hello, son. - I'd like to talk to you. Is that you, B?la? This is Kir?ly speaking. What about the one in the motorbike accident? The transfusion's proceeding? I see. Give him noradrenalin infusion. I'll be there in 10 minutes. Are you ready? - Sorry. Is it very urgent? - No, father. This afternoon. We can talk then. The liver rupture case is getting worse. I'd like to see the statistics of the cancer checkups of last month. Hello, son. Where were you? - At the river. - So early? Mum... What would you say if I drowned? What an idea! You're a clever boy. You don't do such foolish things. Pack your things. Don't leave anything behind. It's high time. I can't remember him... His face... My memory has failed me. - I'll go and see her. - Who? - His granny. Oh, yes. I'll go with you. I'd like to go alone. Hi. B?be threw me out. She blames us two for everything. She's totally upset. She has a crying fit. She's going away. Go to her and do something. - She threw you out? - She wants to break up with me. Hurry! Well, has Kari complained? - Stop fooling around. - It's none of your business. - What's the point of your game? - What game? You know very well. Wasn't Gabi in a bad mood lately? - No. - Of course. You teased him because he loved you. You didn't even notice he'd disappeared. He might have been dead for an hour and nobody missed him. - I noticed it first. - A bit late. - Shut up. - What do you know of him? I know he was a confessor to all of you. "Dear Gabi, I'm in love... " "Help me. " And he did help you, too. When his Granny was out, he gave you and Kari the key. We were friends. Gabi told me everything. He didn't want to sleep with just anyone. He wanted real love. He said that? Yes. Gabi and I had an affair. Ever since the boathouse. It was real love. Complete... As good as yours. Because we were happy. Until the last minute. Gabi, too. Now go! Tell that to everyone! I won't deny it! I wouldn't have thought you were like that. Gabi and I were happier than you and Kari. He's dead. I saw his Granny with his clothes. I'm ashamed of myself. In the morning I started out to the tug-boat. Maybe... I couldn't believe it. On my way I stood gazing at the sports track. The kids were high jumping. I don't know why, I ran, too... I was never good at high jumping. I completely forgot about everything. He's dead in me, too. I tried to draw him. But I can't remember him. An artist has to remember. I've tried this one five times. The first time when I was a student. It's still not the real one. If he woke me this morning, I wouldn't even be annoyed. It seemed such an idiotic joke. But now... Everything seemed so simple... until now... I drew a still life. They said I was talented. It was a copy. You'll be making copies for a long time. Then you'll get somewhere. Morning. Is Luja here? They're in the studio. Hello. Now I'll... feed the pigs. I was looking for you. - I beat the high jumping record. - Are you crazy? Kari will be annoyed. Gabi was my best friend. You all know that. Once there was a person... Now he doesn't exist. He's no longer a personality. From a physiological point of view it's simple. "Decomposition" and so on. But there's a problem. That of responsibility. We were a community. Our personal moral responsibility remains and exists. You're solving a mathematical problem. I hate your explanations. Your smile! Your smugness! You are nervous. If you moulded a pear, it would do you good. You have figures instead of a heart. - And you aren't even ashamed of it. - Not in the least. In the third grade a hard maths problem was set. It took you a week to solve it. Only Gabi and you could solve it. The teacher made you both write it on the blackboard. You both had the same result. We didn't understand a word. I didn't note the analysis. I felt like doing a sketch. The figures blended into lines. Two equations - like two pictures... - Gabi's was better. - I told you so. You told me to shut up. You couldn't understand. Maybe. The blackboard was cleaned. The result remained. The trouble is, none of us can face this. We are compelled to close our eyes. Don't go away. How long will you stay? I don't know. We'd better not meet again. All aboard! If you want, I'll marry you. The seventh place where we live. I know every region of the country. Tomboy... You think I'm conceited? Sophie! I don't know. We'll go for a walk when I'm done. I didn't remember taking that photo. You must have loved him very much. How do you know? I can feel it. We'd have been good friends. - With who? - With Gabi. Still, you couldn't remember him. Now I remember more and more. The more I'm together with you. I was the one who missed him first. - Isn't that so? - It is. Don't bother about the others. Mind your own feelings! Not B?be, Kari or anyone. It's not true, not true! Nothing happened in the boathouse. We were only lying together. In our track suits. I was afraid. We were trembling... He just caressed my face. But the others thought... I didn't care. I didn't want the others to laugh at him. And now, never, never... Is that you, Luja? His Granny... They say where the bread circles, there the body lies. Did he talk about me? Once. He was found! I know. How? Yesterday... When I first forgot about him. Then I saw his Granny with his clothes. Two weeks ago, it was a Tuesday, he phoned me in the evening saying he must talk to me. I forgot all about it. Now that the police phoned, as soon as I put down the receiver I remembered. I told him I had no time. I wanted to read an English book I'd borrowed. But my aunt in Bern could have sent it. And on the bicycle tour, in front of that cave, I was rude to him. He was so well-balanced it made me nervous. He had such self-confidence! I mostly envied his character. You could talk to him about everything. About physics, music... Remember the colour of his eyes? I'm terribly scared... I'm only afraid that... I'm afraid I already forgot about him once. I'm afraid of everything. Of the university. I couldn't make friends... Never. You weren't completely right yesterday. We have to formulate... But not only the final result! - I don't dare to go... - Where? - To the identification. He has to be identified. Which way? Would you take me? Jump in at once. Missed the boat... We'll catch it. How is your dad? Got your car still? We went on the test run together. The youngster came up. After the third day, as usual. Old ?ron found him. All the men come up lying on their stomachs. Women come up lying on their backs. A pity. He was a fine lad. You were friends. We've overtaken them. Once we were carrying cement from the station. He was helping with the unloading. It was the youngster in black shorts. "Gabi, this isn't for you. " He just laughed. He carried those heavy sacks as if they were nothing. And it was hotter than today. He was the one left to look after the family. His father died of lung cancer. - Is there a person here... - ... who was pulled out of the river? Yes. Are you a member of the family? I'm the son of the chief doctor. You mustn't go in. It's not allowed. Until someone from the police arrives. Have you got a cigarette? Hello, B?be. You've come back? Not why you think. That's not what I meant. Good afternoon. Open it, please. - Is it him? - Yes. - Your grandson? - Yes. The body found is that of the late G?bor Bajn?czy, 18 years old, student. Close the door. The van will come in no time. - All the best. - Goodbye. G?bor, my dear grandson, my dear flower, my fine, spring flower. Oh, you've faded away. bright star of mine, you have declined. My candlelight. Who was snuffed out in the dark night. Oh, my shining sunshine, A thunderstruck proud pine. To an eternal home you've gone. There is no door or window there. Death, why didn't you choose another one? He had to go under, in the next world wander. Broken is my golden crown. There'll be no new dawn for my loving grandson. For my house is a warm heart. The pride of my farmyard. How could death make us part? Empty is the garden, Empty is the front room, Empty is the kitchen, Empty is the pantry... Comfort my old days, You were my secure base. If only I could share your resting place... Don't hide your shining face, Oh, my darling grandson. Have a cigarette, sergeant. - It'll rain. - Maybe. - The air is humid. The rain will do us good. For the maize. Can I go home on Monday? I want to help my brother - With the harvest. - We'll put it here. I'll arrange it for you. SWIMMING FORBIDDEN - How far in? - Enough. - Uncle ?ron. Any fish? - Not many. Oh, Lord! Come on, son. Well, don't get excited. - I'll get the suitcase. - Leave it to me. Good morning, professor. Open the boot. It's empty. - I hear you've found oil. - And it's a rich source. All the best. Thanks for taking him with you. Well, son, take care of yourself. God bless you. Take care. Don't go astray. And watch your money. Write to us. Would you sound the horn? Twice? It was nice here, but I missed Budapest. I almost forgot. The pictures were quite good. I made a copy of each for you, too. What was the result of the postmortem? Syncope. I thought so. There was no sign of violence. The cause of death was heart failure. Combined with the pressure down there and the variation in temperature. I think the exertion brought about a predisposition. His heart couldn't stand the surpassing of the tolerance limit. The overstressed metabolism might have brought about a sudden rigidity... Or... Have you got a light? Here you are. THE END
