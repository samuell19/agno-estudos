What does it mean to be a cowboy? Oh man, it's my life. I get to see things that people never get to see. We went on down to Coahuila, Mexico and we got the horses up early, it was dark. I got on horseback. We went all day long and got back at night, but we rounded up some cows and got 'em to the pens and marked 'em. But that was in Mexico, in Coahuila, sure it was, lotta fun. Well the fun time was getting 'em in a crowd and roping. I used to pride myself on roping. And I did good and I did bad, but I enjoyed it, and that's the truth. 25,000 acres, 60 head of horses and 20 cowboys and a trailer full of dogs. Sometimes I wished I was born 100 years ago, so I could've been a real cowboy. It was a long time ago, and there was nothing out here but just plain old flat country, except for one spring right down here. Pecan Spring Ranch. I'm Gaston Davis. It was these types of stories that sparked my fascination with cowboys. For six generations the ranch has been in my family. From the sheep, queen of Texas to the start of a new industry with the Anglo goat. My family has always played a role in the agriculture industry. For 130 years the ranch has always been a place where my family can come back and work together and keep the heartbeat of the ranch alive. But the reality is that today, most ranch operations couldn't say the same. There's so many opportunities outside of rural America that's pulling my generation away, myself included. But although I was born into this ranching culture and heritage, I'm just far enough moved and I've not actually lived it myself. I heard all these stories growing up and watched all the westerns, and over the course of time, I had the image of the cowboy built up so much that it was practically a myth. I mean, these stories were incredible, but they were somebody else's and I had no personal experience to pull from. And so I struggled with what was my imagination with the cowboy, and what was a legitimate figure and our history and also in today's reality. I found myself in the city most days with these questions burning inside of me, what is the truth of the cowboy? Do these kind of stories still exist today? Do cowboys still exist? Was I born in the wrong generation and too late to find out. So after graduation, I felt called to find answers to these questions and to write my own story along the way. In order to best search for the answers to my questions about cowboys, I wanna know where I need to go, and also where the cowboy came from. My first stop is with highly acclaimed author and historian professor H.W Brands, at the University of Texas. Well, in the case of American history, it's to the Mexican roots of the cattle industry. So cattle spread from Mexico up North in the direction of the United States eventually reaching Texas, and with the cattle came the Mexican vaqueros, and they eventually taught the Americans that they encountered in Texas, how to deal with cattle. And it was really when the Mexican cattle culture and the Mexican cattle reached what would become the United States, so the American cowboy was born. Once beef enters the American cuisine, then all of a sudden Americans learn about the cowboys. So if somebody were looking for the cowboy today, you'd still go to Texas. I mean, Texas is the home of the cowboys and there's still cowboys in Texas. I suppose you gotta go somewhere else in the United States, Montana would be a good place, Wyoming. But some places sort of in Northern Plains and where there's still lots of cowboys, but personally, I would like to see how cowboys do their job, do their work, how they're viewed in other countries in the Americans. Mexico would be an obvious one because the Texas cowboy originated from the Mexican cowboy and in South America, they have big cattle industry in Argentina, so what cowboys look like there? My time with professor Brands gave me great insight of where I need to go. To begin the search for the cowboy, I decided to go where it all began, the genesis of the cowboy. We're going to Mexico and meeting my mother's cousin Charro at the border in Del Rio. This will be my first time to visit my family ranch in Mexico. Man, how you doing, man? Oh, it's good to see you. Nice to see you. Yeah, but is there anything else that we need right here in Del Rio? Beer, now y'all want Mexican beer, right? I want. We'll get you some Mexican beer. Okay, all right. So we are right here on the Texas border. People have live on both sides of the border here all think of ourselves as border people. We don't think of ourselves as being Americans or Mexicans, we're just here on the border. This is as too much as times, we're neighbors and we've been neighbors for hundreds of years, so I think we'll be all right. Windshield. So we're in Coahuila right now, and Texas used to be Coahuila. Out here is just really different. The reason it's different is because it's not different. This stayed the way it always has been. Today's my first day with the Vaqueros. We start with breakfast and then it's off to work, and I'll admit, I'm nervous, if my cowboy heroes will accept me. My cowboys we're having breakfast. Our big market for our steers is the United States. So we ship all our steers there. It's still roping, it's branding, it's castrating, it's doing everything the old way, we don't do it any other way. It's my dad did all of this, that's where this all came from, this didn't come from me. I'm just currently the steward of it. Don't put off for tomorrow what's you can do today, that was the way he lived his life. And that's why he got so much done. He was my brother. He was always so sincere and so honest, I loved him. I looked up to him, I respected him. I think he knew more about the cattle business than anyone I ever met. We've been down there, oh, my gosh, ever since 1948. And we we're still down there in Mexico and having a lot of fun doing business with him. I like a calendar. That night one of the younger vaqueros invited me to his home to met his family. It's a privilege and it's humbling to see the personal lives of the vaqueros on the ranch. I'm eager now to step back into their working lives. Each cowboy has several horses that he rides. They ride 'em for about two months, a month or two months, it depends. And then they'll switch 'em out, release those horses and bring in a whole new remuda and then work those horses for a while. We want a working horse, but they're not just born working horses. They start off as potrillos, which are just wild coats, and it's a process to get them to where it's a working horse. That process takes time and effort and a lot of work from our cowboys. Today the vaqueros will be breaking in a few of theirs potrillos. First, we must search for them. All of the work we do on the ranch, all with all the cattle is all on horseback, so we have to have horses. I'm not really sure which horse that we're gonna get today, but we may get one that's either never had a saddle on him, and most likely that's the case. And so we'll be getting someone on a horse for the first time. These horses they've already brought in work, those are the large, the older horses. That's why when I say we start 'em at around two we're not riding him at that age. No, we just start getting 'em in, and getting 'em used to we're just taking these out, so we don't have too many horses in here right now, before we start really working on breaking a horse. Some of these boys will be the first time they've ever been roped. We're gonna get down to those in a minute. It's not one of these horse whisper deals that you see on TV, like from India where the guy gets on his back and rolls around on the ground with him, this is kind of done the old way. We're a gentle with him, but they're still, it's breaking a horse. This is the first time this animal's ever been roped. Light on your feet. When the vaqueros called me in to the corrals, I not only saw this as an opportunity to work with them, but to prove myself. Victor then began to show me the first step of how they break their wild horses. Then he handed me the rope and said, ", try it." One more time. Let her go. But then you do that until it gets used to being in here and being on a halter, that's stage one, stage two is what they're doing now. There's some horses that take it really quickly, and they're very gentle and some of them are not. Look over here at my finger, on the right. Let's watch this a little longer. So the horse, if he could actually rear up, 'cause he's got his back leg lift up, he can't rear up right now. If he could rear up and all he might rear over backwards, hurt himself, he could run and this way he doesn't get hurt, he gets used to being touched. So that's why they keep hitting him with the saddle, which of course doesn't hurt him at all, but it makes a noise. And he gets used to the sound and he gets so he's not scared anymore. So pretty soon they'll be able to put a saddle on him. And then after a while, they'll be able to throw the saddle on him as well. Once the horse realizes says that he can't move that well, then he won't buck, he won't take off running and he won't get hurt until he gets used to, after once he gets used to all of this. 'Cause right now he feels kind of helpless because he can't get that back foot down. He'll notice right now they're starting to move his back foot some. I'll start dealing with his back foot here in a minute, and then they'll let his foot down. You wanna get in the middle of the thorax 'cause he's gonna start running. This is the third time he's been ridden. Once he's actually saddled and they're riding him, they'll come to a point very quickly where they'll actually take him out. He'll go out with the cowboys. They won't rope off of them for a while, but they'll start riding, going out on the daily, riding him daily. Then they'll let him go after a while and then bring him back in again and it's a period over about six months, he would go from when he was first roped, to when they put a saddle on him, about six months after you start riding him, then they're actually roping off of him, and then he's pretty much a complete animal. You need a horse, right? You have to have a horse, too many draws, too many creeks, too many clips. Everything is done on the horse. Like this process, I mean, how far back does it go? Oh, it's as far about a hundred years. A hundred years. Yeah, I mean several hundred years. It's just the way it's always been done so to speak. There was something truly special in doing a job that had never changed. I felt the connection, not only with my heritage, but with vaqueros. Despite our differences and the corrals, we were equals. Returning home from Mexico. I have a newfound appreciation for where the legend began. It's no coincidence that the cowboy emerges in American national conscience after the civil war. Up until the civil war, there was this diverging sense of who we are. So the Southerners, we hold slaves and we're part of the slave society. Northerners, were opposed to slavery and we have this different model. So what brings the country together after the civil war? And again, it was no accident that the cowboy served very well because Northerners and Southerners could meet on the Western Plains and they could be sort of seen for what they are instead of having to deal with that baggage left from the civil war. Do you know how to deal with the cattle? Can you brave the climate, can you do all that stuff? So in some ways the cowboy was this myth, not so much of creation exactly, but as of a reunification myth. And so it pulls the country together at a time when the country most needs to be pulled together. Now that I know where the cowboy came from, I wanted to know where the cowboy is going. I really think there's something special about the nostalgia of cowboy and ranching. I mean, it's something that's a rich part of the American heritage. I don't wanna ever really feel like we lose that, I just think that we have a purpose, we have an objective to not just kind of fall by the wayside. I mean, we've got so many tools at our fingertips to help us do it better. There will always be a place and a time for the cowboy. You need to have diversity, you have to be ready for change. And so we'll just continue to evolve, I believe, and continue to get better and better. How you doing? Good, how are you? - I'm all right. - Nice to see you, nice to see you. - Nice to see you. What I thought was gonna get an overview of who we are, what we're doing, where we live down here, we're in big sandy here, but if I zoom way out, this is the scope of the ranch here, goes about 45 miles Southeast. There's more of a big view of it, there as it goes across. My first morning on the IX Ranch, I noticed an immediate difference from Mexico. The faster pace, the machinery, and even the noises. If I got here, that kind of more of a way of working out with like ATVs or with dirt bikes? I mean, is that kind of something you're seeing around here? Yes, and here's why. I grew up riding horses, but I also I grew up riding four-wheelers and dirt bikes and those types of things and were constantly learning new and better ways to do things. It's like, we were talking about the motorcyclists someone to see me out there on that, they'd be like, "Wow, that's not a cowboy." And I'd be like, "You haven't flipped a few pages into the cover of the book yet." When it's 30 below, and I gotta bring in some cattle, I'm sorry, I'm not gonna wear my cowboy boots and sharps, and a cowboy hat and go freeze my butt off out there just so I look like a cowboy. I'm gonna look like an Eskimo out there and look probably like the silliest thing you've ever seen, barely getting around on a horse, I gotta get the cow. I mean, I have to take care of this situation. I don't always have to look it to be it, everything that this ranch does and generates is from what it has here, so I have to focus on efficiencies. The fact is I have a big job to do out here and we have a lot of land to cover and a lot of things to do and my time is valuable. But you gotta train a horse, you gotta feed a horse, you gotta shoe a horse, less and less of that being done. The motorcycle for me, it allows me to see a lot of things in a day that on a horseback or taking my pickup would have a huge impact on the land. I can cover so much with that bike and see what I need to see as the manager of this place, and know what needs to be done. I can easily go find if there's missing cattle somewhere. It's a part of toolbox of things that I use to help me do my job better. So yes, I wouldn't say that it's like taking over because we're never gonna be where we don't work at, you'll see, on Tuesday the gators will be out there, we'll use those, but it'll be to drift stuff to where we are with horses. We're still doing the same thing. What we're doing with the resource hasn't changed so much. I think there's a disconnect anymore on urban American and rural America. To get that stake to their plate takes a lot of work all the way down the line. But we do, we have a disconnect between what's really going on and what they think is going on. I think cowboys still handle cattle to the best welfare they can for the animal, and then for the people they're raising the cattle for. Monday, that's getting another 300 some head into the pasture, so there's 900 in there, so on Tuesday we can sort 900. Every year about this time we get ready for sorting, so we can start collecting these smaller groups into a large group so that we can sort the steer pairs and the half pairs and be ready to start shipping the steers and we need time. I'm always thankful for being out here, always kind of dreamed about going out West and being a cowboy out there. I knew that if I didn't try it, then I'd always be regretting it. So I didn't come out to change anything. I came out to do what was a already there. It's not all just about the boots, the sharps, the horses, it's about how you handle your cattle, how you treat the cattle, just how you care for them. Off this reservoir and then they're gonna go a little bit back to that. Well, as you're looking straight ahead, look to your right and back there, there's an grazing on the. We decided to become responsible for a living breathing thing. And over right behind- You have to just be capable. I think is what it comes down to is you have to be able to do the job and it doesn't matter what you look like doing it. Well, I think that's really cool that your ranch is kind of the meeting the two styles in the middle. I'm hoping when you guys come away from it, you see that there are still cowboys, but that we're adapting, I guess. We have to take care of what we've got, and we're just using the tools that we've got before us to do that, we were using it all. If you can't see shoes on horses making sparks in the night then you know you're not out there. Do you have somebody that can go gather? Yeah, go ahead. They gonna have to go back, I can go down. I got about up 50 cattle up here on. And I got another. Okay, let's split up. Hey, so Rusty how many have you sorted today? 719. 719, all right. After we finished sorting Richard went straight back to his office to put all the numbers into his books. It's the hardest part of the business to focus on. I think there's a change, and there has to be a change as it gets harder and harder to make money because it's still a business. You can't manage what you don't measure. By measuring what we're doing, we're able to make more proactive management decisions instead of being so dang reactive to everything. The cowboy will never go away, there'll always be a need for people to do the hard jobs that no one else is willing to do. Because of the passion that we have for what we do, we're always learning. There will always be a place and a time for the cowboy. Coming home from Montana, I learned that not all cowboys look the same, only their purpose does. Gary in Montana is one of the few people in my generation that I've come across pursuing the cowboy lifestyle. It seems like most millennials desire to know where their food comes from, but few desire to actually be a part of the process. So what is it? What keeps young people coming back to a seemingly fading way of life. I'm excited to explore this idea a further on my next stop. In reality, there are a lot of things people can do to make a lot more money, but it is a passion that our family has, and it's something that through the generations our family has worked to not only keep the ranch in the family, but also the family in the ranch. Growing up every time I would leave for school, my dad would always say the same thing. He would always say, "Son, be a leader today." We don't want to create pressure for our boys. We want them to do what they feel called to do. Wildlife was kind of where he had focused his attention and felt like that was what he wanted to do, he wanted to play college sports, he lived that dream and that was an awesome experience. After going to college and making a new group of friends and seeing that I really wasn't quite like those people. We have such different backgrounds, but the background that I have, I would never take back. I remember two years ago, Tucker went with me to the Florida Cattlemen's Convention. Each of those five ranches in Florida that we visited, guess what the question was, Tucker, I guess you're headed back to the ranch. And at each of those stops, he stumbled with that question. He didn't really know where he was headed next, or what he was gonna do. That night he and I sat down for supper, and I said, "Tuck, I want you to go and pursue your dreams and pursue your calling. Wherever it is, go where you feel called to go. And if that's at the ranch, the door's open." And that just seemed like there was this huge weight lifted off of his shoulders. And I learned that the more I was away from home, the more that I just was drawn back, and connected to the land that was here. I was tied back home. And I do believe that's where we find true joy. Is when we live within our calling. From creation forward, there have always been people that have accepted the call to be caretakers of his creation. And so I see that as a continual, for a period of time, this is what man will do. - Oh, I'm I - Okay, so this is my brother- Hey, what's up? Yeah, okay, cool, good to meet you, man. I think that is a continual calling of what man is called to do. We're just in the process of kind of, we're sorting a lot of different ways. So yesterday and today, two big days for us. Weaning, we're sorting cows, one, two, three, four, five, different ways, depending on which pasture they go to. A lot of record keeping here, we're different being a seed stock herd we're raising breeding cattle, right? Individual animal management is very important. Instead of this pasture being a unit and that pasture being unit, every single animal is a unit. And so with that we keep inventory of where every single animal goes. I mean, we've got spreadsheets this long showing every move that every cow has made on this ranch. Right down here at the far two pins, we've got an individual feed efficiency testing center. I mean, as you look at our global society, we've got a lot more mouths to feed, not anymore land. So the best way I know to feed these people is to be more efficient in producing the food with the given resources that we ask. So on this side of town, a lot of my family lives here in really close proximity. My wife and I just bought this house and we'll be moving into it here soon. And then just down the street is the house where my grandfather was raised and where he lives now. Going to eat? I slept 12 hours last night. We don't know exactly where we've been. We've been South of town, past the South Brown Ranch went West, turned North, came out by. We've been 50 miles. Well, we've been, Rob do you have a hat or a cap? No, thank you. Okay. Anyway, y'all come on in. It started in about 1903, in the early times in the cattle industry. And a lot of it was just new and different. Changes happened, in a lot of ways but in a lot of ways it was the same. The cattle, the horses, things that made a lot of difference. And as it changed we changed with it. We'd do a lot of things horseback. And then today you're in a pickup, but I still love it and take care of it. We had a lot of fun, a lot of hard work to it. We're just part of it, and part of the family and another generation's coming on, and it means a lot to us. Has it been fun watching dad? It's a real neat deal to help one another, like I said, it doesn't just happen. It's taken a few generations, haven't it? Yeah, and more to come. And more to come. And so when people get tied to something that always brings you back to something you wanna help, you wanna be a part of that. You've been noticing like a generational gap? Yeah, there's been a generation gap of people that didn't necessarily come back, that were born here but didn't come back and we've seen that in our school numbers dropping in the past three years. Now, my generation and the millennials, I guess you'd say are, are starting to come back and be a part of the community, which has been fun to watch. Of my age group I'm one of the first to come back, but we're trying to make it to where there's not another generational gap. Gotcha. We wanna make it better, whatever way we can. What a group of people have been doing for a short time now in Throck Morton is really trying to revive the school. And because if the school falls, the town falls, we've seen it happen in a lot of rural communities. Nelson you throughout all of our conversations about Throck Morton School District you've talked a lot about, what are our expectations for our children? And I'd love to hear from the newest resident, and homeowner of Throck Morton, Texas of his expectations of why he moved back to Throck Morton. If he can do that in 30 seconds. It took you more than 30 seconds to ask the question. My expectation is a place to be typed. Whenever I graduated high school, I didn't have the intention on coming back. I've lived here my whole life but this has been different 'cause I'm moving in with a new life. I can be a part of a lot of different things in the community that I couldn't whenever I was in school. I've definitely seen how everyone loves each other here. If you don't move back, the town's not gonna be here. I wanna come back to the ranch and I want the town to be here. We are coming in at a really good time. And that we needed Throck Morton and Throck Morton needed us. The impact the Browns had on Throck Morton was easy to see just how they cared and loved for those around them. But their influence was not limited to only Throck Morton. In my last days there, they began preparations for a ranch rodeo coming up that their family had a large presence in. This would be the 37th annual, Texas ranch round up in Wichita Falls. And my dad gathered up three or four ranches. Wouldn't it be neat if we could find a way for our ranch cowboys to get back to what we do on a daily basis at the ranch. He had the kind of the vision of being different than regular rodeos. Going to a ranch rodeo and seeing the more kind of the way rodeo really started was what we've returned back to with ranch rodeo, where the men on our ranches can compete and you do it with a team and you do it with guys that you're with and work with all the time. And so my dad helped start this, which is now, I mean, ranch rodeo is across the nation and people love it because it's their hometown team that they come to cheer for. So team meeting here for ranch rodeo, big weekend ahead, excited about it. You know all the plans made, what needs to be done here and there and kind of coordinate that and come up with a game plan. So would you kick us off with a prayer please. Lord, thank for this day, thank you for the rain that you sent our way. Lord, thank you for allowing us to do what we love to do. Lord, please keep head protection over all the cowboys and livestock this weekend, shine your life, in Jesus name I pray, amen. Everybody that's there I would love for you to go cheer on Tucker Carley, their talent competitions at one. Okay. Do you know what you're gonna do? Nope. We talked about it last night and we were like, "Well, we're not wanna figure something out." We'll see if Tim McGrew faith he'll do it. Oh, maybe Jason. Y'all wanna win this thing? Absolutely. We won this event in 1984, 1992 and in 2006. I Love it will be great. One, two, three. It's time, proud and time to win this baby again. Okay, let's do it. So every year, a saddles awarded to the top cowboy at the ranch rodeo and in 1992, Donald Brown won it. And so Atlanta has been training to hopefully win it this year. This show, my goal is to go in there and be slow and smooth and let him be correct, more laid back and ready to go. Golan is very talented and he's great with a horse, he's great with the rope, he understands cattle. Now he's a very talented cowboy. I think that this saddle will be a really big award for him that he's always wanted. I'm confident Golan is gonna win that saddle. Hello Texas, Wichita Falls, how are you tonight on the side of the rail? Well, we thank you, this is the original, the granddaddy of them all, 37 consecutive years, the Ranch Roundup right here. I'm Charlie Flock from Grandview, Texas along with my partner in crime, James from La Cruz de in Mexico. And the intention of the event was to bring the ranch cowboys off the ranch, bring 'em to town and have good friendly competition in the events that mirror what we do on the ranch on a regular basis. Now, wild cow milking every now and then you gotta catch a cow in the pasture. Yeah. Don't spill that milk. And brand new calves and doctoring one when he gets sick and being able to rope and do it in the pasture, those are all real life situations. Paning cattle out of, taking 'em outta the herd and putting 'em into a pen. Riding we still break horses today and we need to ride one that can buck. The camaraderie has been amazing among the teams for 37 years, since this event began. Those multi-day tournaments you don't win it in the first day, you can only lose it. They're in striking distance to do some good tonight, it's fun. In all these places, it just drive out in the country and you're gonna find the same basic culture that you find in Throck Morton, Texas, is alive in South Saga City in Japan, it is in Australia and all the way to wherever you go, all you have to do is drive out in the country and find it. It's not very far away. And if people in the outside world could see that that's what's out here maybe it restores some of that, you're feeling about mankind, still out there, there are those kind of people. In my time with the Brown family, I have not only felt their love and seeing how it impacts their community, but I also see them as a beacon of hope for the future of the cowboy. As Americans found themselves more and more living in cities and working for other people, and being at the mercy of forces beyond their control. The idea that at one time there was this figure who was in control of his own destiny. This becomes even more powerful, the farther it is from everyday reality. Nations sort of live on their myths. The stories they tell themselves about themselves. I feel myself closer to a better understanding of the cowboy. But Kelly's words ringing my ear as I return home. Is it true? No matter where I go, will I find the same culture, the same passion, the same spirit. Let's find out. We've heard the legend of the Gaucho. Now it's time to go and see the real thing. We were invited to go to Miguel's Estancia in Patagonia, just outside of San Martin, De Los Andes. Once we finished working cattle that morning, we stopped by a creek, unsettled, watered our horses and started a fire. And because of the coolness of the weather, they even packed lunch in their saddle bags. Before I arrived in Argentina, I heard that Miguel had written the book about the forming of his ranch in Patagonia. So when I asked him about it, he was thrilled to show me, pioneer. Well, as it turns out, Kelly was right. It doesn't matter where you go, but if you venture into the country, you will find people that share commonality of servitude. From the animals in the pasture, to the food on our plates. And if you take the time to get to know them, what's earned is a better understanding and appreciation for what they do for us, thankless day in and day out. Returning home from Argentina, I bring Miguel's story home with me, and I'm reminded of just how powerful a story can be. Second place cattle. When you tell this story, you automatically, I think help ensure that there is a future. As much myth as it is history, myths are very powerful. Although the moment of the cowboy in history is brief. The moment of the cowboy in American memory goes on and on. All established one place where we could all relate to. And we could all come back to. One place where we all came from, very important place. Is not the cowboys. Returning home It's an honor to share the stories of my journey, stories of family, of courage, of change, and of unity. And I can now put to rest the questions that once burned inside me. The truth of the cowboy is simple, it's our histories that make us different, but our future that brings us together, toward a common purpose, feeding the world, one plate at a time. Amen. And we all have a call to answer to. Seek and you will find, knock and the door will be opened to you.
