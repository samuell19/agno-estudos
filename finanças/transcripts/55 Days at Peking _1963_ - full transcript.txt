Peking. China. The summer of the year 1900. The rains are late, the crops have failed, a hundred million Chinese are hungry and a violent wind of discontent disturbs the land. Within the foreign compound a thousand foreigners live and work, citizens of a dozen far-off nations. What is this terrible noise? Different nations saying the same thing, at the same time. We want China. Sha-shao! Separated from the foreign compound by only a wall and a gate, is the Forbidden City. Here, in untouchable isolation lives the Dowager Empress, last of the Manchus. Protected by an army of eunuchs, she holds court and consults with her ministers, mandarins and generals. You will halt the execution. But I have orders from Prince Tuan! And now you have an order from me. The nightingale will recover. The arts of the Court physician will prevail. Only yesterday I listened to its song. Your Highness. The execution has been stopped. - Who? - Yung-Lo. Your Majesty, I come to ask your displeasure, Divine One. Take my life instead of the Colonel's. We cannot spare you. It was I who gave the orders for the troops to fire on the Boxers. They were burning Christian missions, killing foreigners. We have sad news. The nightingale... it was your gift. Do you remember, Yung-Lo? I have not forgotten. I live only to serve Your Majesty. And how does the General's attack on the Boxer patriots serve Her Highness? If the Boxers remain unchecked, a dozen foreign armies will descend on China. We are tens of millions. Let them come. Does the Empress believe that where the imperial Army has failed, the swords of the rebel will succeed? Our Gods are with the Boxers. The voice of the nightingale is still. I hear only the sound of crows. Your Majesty, a violent wind does not last till morning. The Boxers have arisen like the wind and the rain, and like the wind and the rain, they will disappear. May the Boxers be guided by the will of the gods. About the Colonel, Your Majesty. Let his end will be a sign, to the people and a warning to the foreigners. The Colonel's death is of no consequence. But his life has set my Prince against my General and this disturbs the tranquility of the morning. Let him die for this offense. You are concerned, Yung-Lo? If the Boxers fail, I will give the foreigners Prince Tuan's head. Eyes front, soldier. All right, Marines, eyes front! We're almost in Peking, the capital city of China. This is an ancient, and a highly cultured civilization, so don't get the idea you're any better than these people just because they can't speak English. A few of words of Chinese will go a long way. Repeat after me. The word for 'Yes' is 'shih'. Shih. - The word for 'No' is 'Bu shih". - Bu shih. Remember, it's just the same here as anywhere else in the world, everything has a price. So pay your money and don?t expect any free samples. Yes, sir. Right turn! Column... Halt! We going to break that up, Major? You're gonna stay right here! - Murphy! - Yes, sir? Ni hao. Please tell the Boxer chief I'd like to do business with him. I want to buy that old man. But he's Britain, you're American. Twenty dollars. Ching Ju! Tell him I'll only do business if the old man's alive. Nothing if he's dead. Give me double the amount, do you want? Forty dollars. All right. He's dead. But he say you must pay anyway because you have spoiled the ceremony. Nothing doing. Twenty dollars. Tell your friend I'm still willing to do business. I'll buy the dead Boxer. Forty dollars. Twenty dollars. - Did you fire that shot? - Yes, sir. Nice shooting, Sergeant. Thank you, Major. That'll cost you twenty bucks, out of your pay. Fall in! Alright... Fall in! - Take them around to the barracks. - Yes, sir. - Murphy! - Yo. This is it. Tell the Baroness, I?m still waiting. As you know, your Excellency, I have already sent her a note. You're the owner of this hotel, Barak Mont, tell her yourself. Well, I'll see what there is, Count. Excellency, please. Excuse me, Signor. Barak Mont, in my capacity as Russian Minister to Peking, I order you to get her down here. As you wish, your Excellency. But you must remember, she is still a guest. I cannot order her around. Excuse me, your Excellency, but I think you could do with a cold drink. - And so could I. - Champagne, your Excellency? How are you? It's been a long time. It's okay. You're beautiful. Natasha! Would you like to come with us to have fun? Baroness Ivanoff! Yes, Sergei? Not enough that you keep me waiting, now you choose to ignore me. You are a little nervous, Sergei. I suggest something cool to drink for all of us. - Sorry. - It's okay. We'll go ourselves. Goodbye. Natasha ... I Thank you. I try not to talk about the necklace. But you are talking about it. I'm talking to you as Russian Imperial Minister to Peking ... Please, Sergei, just speak to me as my brother-in-law. Natasha, I've told Mr Bergmann that your visa has been revoked. Consequently, you have no right to remain in this hotel, Peking or for that matter anywhere in China. - You're legally non-existent. - You're frightening me Sergei. Where will you go? To your Chinese friend? You must hate me, Sergei. You're wrong, Natasha. I do not hate you. Please leave! You're a fool. My conscience is clear, but you have lost everything. You will end up naked in the streets. Not entirely naked. I'll still have the necklace. Today... She must be out of here today. Yes, your Excellency. I'll take care of it. Good afternoon, Sir. I hope I get one of the rooms with a bath this time. I'm sorry sir. Did you have a reservation? Well, hello there, Lewis. - Hi. - Hi. You're late. When did you get in Colonel? - This morning. - What kept you so long? We had to walk the last 10 miles. The railroad isn't running anymore. Gentlemen, the railroad isn't anymore. - Major Lewis! - Hey Bergmann. - Haven't you got a room for me? - All rooms are taken. - Alright, if you'll wait a short while. - Fine. Ah, thanks, Chiang. Here you are. Thanks Major, any time you need me. That's half my life in here, Bergmann. Take good care of it for me. And some more of your life here, Major. Oh, yeah. Let me use your waste basket. Well, they're six months. Open a letter, you have to read it. Read it, you may have to answer it. Lewis! - Ah, Carlo! - I miss you! - Ah Captain. - You're late. What kept you so long? I lost 2 men. Had to stop to bury them. Come on Andy, let's get something to drink. Alright. Why don't you try to get a room here too, Andy. I want to look up the kid. Maybe find a place closer to her. Oh yeah, your little girl. - How old is she now, anyway? -11. No, I guess she's 12 already. Too rough on her. No mother and practically no father. What else can I do? Now she's with a French mission and a bunch of Chinese orphans. You re better than most fathers at least ... you try to see her when you can. Yeah, but leaving her with a mission. It's not my idea how to raise a kid. But what do I do? Take her back to Illinois with me? All the half Chinese kid they got in Illinois. They'd treat her like a freak back home. Yeah, she's better off here among her own kind. - You really think so, Matt? - Sure. May I have your key, Baroness? I must have a room for the American officer. Thank you. Besides, you have to live your own life too. Excuse me, I've just had an invitation. Please do sit down, Major. Bring your friend. We can all drink together. He don't need to tell us his troubles. What should I tell you, Major? Well, that you're happy I?m with you. Are you always this direct. I?m a marine, ma'am. I don't have much time. How much time are you allowing for me? Now. Have you found this approach very successful? Not really, no. It's the only one I know. Keep drinking, Major. Your tight uniform will hold you together. - Clever women make me nervous. - No, please... Please don?t go. What can I offer you? My life? My room. They just gave it to you. Is that too much to ask? No, my life isn't worth much, but ... hotel rooms in Peking are at a premium right now. Do you always offer your life to strangers? To a soldier, strangers make the best friends. But I?m not in uniform, Major. I like things fine, just the way they are. Major Lewis. Major Lewis, sir. A British orderly to see you. The British Minister's compliment, sir. He wishes to see you. He told me to tell you. sir, that your minister Mr Maxwell is in hospital. That he's been authorized from Washington to act for him. Fine. Tell him I'll be right along as soon as I get to clean up. Yes, sir. Here is your key, Major. Thanks. What shall I do with your belongings, whatever it is? - Put them back, Bergmann. - But there's only one room, Major. Let the Baroness figure it out. She's a clever woman. Don?t laugh yet, Major. It's a very small room. Well, I've been in tight places before. So have I, Major. - Daddy! - Teresa! Daddy! Daddy! - Hello, Britten. Good to see you again. - Good day, sir. Now wake up, sentries! Now take a tip from an old soldier. Whenever you see a Major of the American Marines, you will present arms. And don't forget it! If this be I, as I suppose it be, I have a little dog at home. He'll know me. Come in. I?m, sorry, Arthur. Are you busy? Of course I am. I always am. Busier than usual? Or just busy? Both. Well, what's the pressing female problem? Just this. Am I to pack or am I not to pack? Are we going to England? Do we take our leave this year or not? I don?t know. You don?t know... So why don't you just pack and then if we don?t go, all you have to do is to unpack. If the men had to do the packing and the unpacking, the world would be a very different place. - If I had my way... - What? You and I would have long since packed and be miles away from here. You and I? That's a comforting thought. Thank you, darling. Is it all going to go up in flames, Arthur? - Not if I can help it. - What do you mean? Let me try and put it in a nutshell. If I encourage the policy that the Great Powers should be tough with China, that will bring about a situation where China will become just another battlefield for the Great Powers to fight over. So I think it's wiser if we accept this temporary humiliation at the hands of the Boxers and hope that by damping down the fire, the kettle won't boil over. And then? And then, I shall probably receive the displeasure of American's Government, and you and I will be retired upon a most inadequate pension. You remember what Napoleon said about China? I never forget it. Let China sleep. For when she wakes, the world will tremble. He did say an awful lot, didn't he? Come in. - Major Lewis, sir. - Ask him to wait one moment. Darling, forgive me. I have to put on my official face for a little while. You haven?t forgotten our soir?e tonight? Two dozen dozen bottles of champagne already on the ice. - Anything else the Sahib will require? - The first waltz, if you can spare it. Hmm, let me think about it. Philip! Major Lewis, Sir Arthur. As you were. Do you want to stand up, or sit down, or walk around the room? Personally, I need to walk around the room. Won't you please yourself. I have a most unpleasant task to fulfill. So first of all, I'd like to congratulations you on the initiative you showed this morning with Father Beamish. Well, we were a little late. It was most unfortunate that a Chinese was killed. - A Boxer? - A Chinese citizen, Major. You're not in the Wild West now, you know. You don't go around shooting Chinese like you do Red Indians. No, sir. And secondly, I want to warn you that any repetition of your irresponsible behaviour, could very easily involve the last remaining members of the human race in a conflagration of considerable proportions. I understand. And lastly, since your own Minister is suffering from what might turn out to be a diplomatic illness, it's I who will have to tell you that your presence in this city is no longer required. No longer required by whom? Major, I'm just relaying a message from your own Legation. Personally, I'd be delighted if you stayed. Yes, sir. Look, I suppose you know all hell is going to break loose here? If all hell is going to break loose, it will not be because we have provoked it. So we'll all just walk softly and hope for the best. Even if we walk on our knees, we can't stop this. I have just marched 70 miles from Tientsin. There are Boxers everywhere. They're killing every white men, especially missionaries, and every Chinese Christian they can find. And the Imperial Army isn't lifting a finger to stop them. The Boxer bandits have been with us for years, Major. It could be that you're unnecessarily alarmed. Well, the next time I see some bandits murdering an English priest, I'll try not to be alarmed. I've been a soldier myself, Major. I understand exactly how you feel. But as a diplomat I have to try and look at the larger picture. I wouldn't know about the larger picture. I just do a job patrolling the rice paddies out in the back country. But I know this much ... If the Boxers get as far as Peking, you're going to wish there were more soldiers in these compounds and less women and children. Well, now we've both had our say. I'll go quietly. Oh, by the way, it's our Queen's birthday today, and we're entertaining tonight. We'd be delighted if you'd come. Thank you. I won't leave Ming behind. I'll pack him in my case. Don?t be silly, dummy. He'd suffocate. - What's that? - He won't be able to breathe. - It's only for five weeks. - Come on. Let's go and see papa. May we speak to you, father? It's very important. There are no secret negotiations in progress at the moment. What's the problem? Mother says we can't take Ming back to England with us. - I won't leave my dog. - He's my dog. - Who feeds him? - Who taught him to sit up? He's mine. I tell you what. We'll cut him exactly in two. And you'll each get half. - Oh Father. Don?t play King Solomon. - I tried. Atten...tion! Shoulder... arms! Present... arms! Slope... arms! His Excellency, the Minister of Austria-Hungary and the Baroness Von Riedel. Welcome, Prince Tuan, to Her Britannic Majesty's Legation. I am deeply honored. His Imperial Highness, Prince Tuan. I bring greetings from our Empress. You are most welcome, Your Imperial Highness. Greeting and felicitations to your great queen. May the lion of China and the lion of Great Britain live in peace forever. Our Queen is most touched by the thoughtfulness and the generosity of your illustrious Empress. Your Imperial Highness, Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, the first dance will be the Military Two-Step. Magnifique, fabulous. They should be around my neck. Of course, Sophie, you look positively naked without them. Shall we walk down the end of the line, Baroness? Oh, no. No. Not yet. I've been waiting for this for a long time, and now I?m enjoying it. Natasha, you blind us with your glitter. Would you recognize me without them, Sonya? Major Lewis, I understand you're going to Tientsin tomorrow. That's right, Your Excellency. There is a Russian woman here who has no transit visa and wishes to leave Peking. Anyone we know, Sergei? Naturally it would be her interest to get to know you, about her only chance to reach Tientsin. It might be... If you disregard this, I assure you the Russian government will remember this conversation. - Sir Arthur. - Good evening, Major. Lady Robertson. I've been wanting to thank you personally Major Lewis for trying to help poor Father Beamish. You know the Baroness? Yes, of course. It's been a long time, hasn't it. I know that my husband has already thanked you. Yes, I had already expressed my gratitude. Sir, may I present Baroness Ivanoff and Major Lewis. Your Highness. You must be the American who had the unfortunate encounter with the Boxers this morning. I'm afraid it was the British missionary who had the hard time, sir. My Chinese government is most distressed. But you must not conclude that all Boxers are bandits. Most of them are harmless vagabonds. Entertainers in the market places, much like the gypsies in your country. In fact, Sir Arthur, I have taken the liberty of bringing such a troupe to entertain your guests tonight. Boxers, here? With your permission. Of course, Your Imperial Highness. He wants you to take this sword and try to strike him. Try it, Major. It seems to be part of the performance. If I kill a Boxer, sir, does that create a diplomatic incident? There is no danger. I think you've made your point, Major. Not quite. Bravo! I guess he wasn't a true believer. It seems, Sir Arthur, it is your troops who are invulnerable. You must forgive us, Your Highness, but the Major does not seem to understand that here we must play the game according to Chinese rules. I apologize, Sir Arthur. But I don?t think His Highness came here tonight to play games. Good night. Unfortunately, Sir Arthur, I must return to my duties at the palace. Do not bother to escort me. Ladies and gentlemen, the next dance will be a waltz. May I have a word with you, Sir Arthur? Probably an insult to the British and affront and a challenge to all Powers! A full report of this outrage will go to the Kaiser himself. I just want to assure you gentlemen, that Her Majesty's Government is not unduly alarmed by this Boxer invasion of the British Embassy. I shall personally lodge a complaint to the Chinese Foreign Office in the morning. And what are you going to do, Sir Arthur? I don't know what all of you are going to do, but I intend to have a glass of champagne. You know, I admire Sir Arthur. He always gives me the feeling that God must be an Englishman. We go and we go but we don't get anywhere. Why don't we just go back to the hotel? - Are you tired, Major? - Tired? No. Ready to turn in? Maybe. Have you ever been inside this temple, Major? I think we could get a better drink at the hotel. Very interesting. Can we go now? But we haven?t had our dance yet, Major. Shall we? What happens to you in Tientsin? I'll be entirely in your hands, Major. You are in my hands now but you seem to keep slipping through my fingers. You know, I think I?ll get you to take me to San Francisco with you. Why to San Francisco? Well, isn't that the place where they found all the gold. Just a minute. What's a trinket like that worth, anyway? A lot of money. Looks like we won't be leaving today, I'm sure of it. Just killed the German Minister. But Matt, we must leave... I have to leave. You have to wait. Your sword, Sir Arthur. You are well, Sir Arthur? I am well if you are well, Your Majesty. - We are pleased to receive you. - Your Majesty does me great honor. We have been informed that the unhappy death of the German Minister. The Boxer bandits will be dealt with. But the anger of the Chinese people cannot be quieted so easily. The Germans have seized Kiaochow, the Russians have seized Port Arthur. The French have obtained concessions in Yunnan, Kwangsi and Kwangtung. In all, thirteen of the eighteen provinces of China are under foreign control. Foreign warships occupy our harbors, foreign armies occupy our forts, foreign merchants administer our banks, foreign gods disturb the spirits of our ancestors. Is it surprising that our people are aroused? Your Majesty will permit me to observe that the violence of the Boxers will not address the grievances of China. China is a prostrate cow! The Powers are are no longer content to milk her, now they are butchering her for her meat. If China is a cow, Your Majesty, she is indeed a marvelous animal that not only gives meat as well as milk, but at the same time grows stronger. She's learning new arts of peace from the west. But China's greatest virtue is her patience. And if she will exercise that now, she will achieve everything. And if not? If not, if the councils of violence and impatience prevail, then the blood of millions will be shed and the agony will be prolonged. Would you please go to the window, Sir Arthur? There is something I have arranged for you to see. I hope you will inform your government that Chinese justice is swift and thorough. Those men are the ones who murdered Baron von Meck this morning. Where lies the guilt? With the one who wields the sword or the one who gives the command? You know who gave the command? With Your Majesty's permission, I would like to present an eyewitness. By all means, Sir Arthur. Major Lewis, Your Majesty. Evidently, Major, you are in possession of secret information about the Boxer leadership. It's not much of a secret, Your Highness. Please go on, Major Lewis. I saw the man who commanded the Boxers this morning. The one who ordered the attack on the German Minister. You would know him? It was Prince Tuan. You believe this story, Sir Arthur? I do, Your Majesty. And you have come here to ask us to take action against Prince Tuan? I?ve come here with the truth The truth that is already known to the German government and to all the other Powers. We reject your truth, Sir Arthur. And your protest. We are pleased to inform you that Prince Tuan is our closest and most trusted adviser. Only this morning we appointed him to head the Foreign Office. For our part, Your Majesty, Great Britain wants nothing more than continued friendly relations with China. Because of the protracted drought, because of hunger and unrest among my people, because of the merciless demands of the foreign powers, the situation in Peking cannot be expected to become tranquil. Therefore we earnestly advise you, Sir Arthur that all foreign residents, including diplomatic personnel, should leave Peking within twenty-four hours. Is Your Majesty informing me that she is severing diplomatic relations with all the powers? Not at all. Her Majesty was clear enough. Her Highness is offering informal advice for your safety and protection. - I am in favour of that. - Major Lewis. She can't control the Boxers. We'd better get out before we're wiped out. Prince Tuan, you will be responsible to see that these gentlemen are escorted safely to their Legations. We might do better on our own. - Do we walk? - Yes, very slowly. Keep walking. Squad! Come on! Move in. - Thought you might need some help, Sir. - Yes, thank you, John. Bill, count the votes. We're waiting for the American Minister. Ah, Mr. Maxwell. Hello. I'm sorry to drag you out of your sick bed. We need your vote, on whether to stay or leave Peking. The United States has no territorial concession in China. Never asked for and don't want one. I'm afraid I've to abstain, Sir Arthur. I understand, Mr. Maxwell. I just wanted you to witness the proceedings. Well congratulations, gentlemen. You have all voted to go. There are nine votes to leave Peking. Great Britain has voted to stay. We'll stay alone if necessary. But that is not acceptable. We will all look ridiculous, if we flee from Peking and the British remain. Perhaps there is a reason why the British would like to remain here alone. The only foreign power in Peking. My friend's calling maybe right. Perhaps, are there some private information? I have made my position absolutely clear. Admiral Sydney is already on his way to Peking with a force of several thousand men. He will be here at the most in 9 days. In the meantime, I for one have no intention of displaying fear of the Boxers, nor of handing a victory to Prince Tuan. If the British stay, the German stay. Surely Sir Arthur, you realise that we here, must make a decision in the interest of our thousands of civilians. Do you wish to be the one man who is standing in the way of that safe evacuation? I have, of course, appreciated the risk, Senor Guzm?n. But I believe if we all stand united that the Chinese won't dare mount a serious attack upon the representatives of the eleven great Powers. And if we do all stand firm, we may preserve peace in China and indeed in the whole world. Perhaps you are right, Sir Arthur. If the other Powers decide to stay, Austria will have no choice. Congratulations, Sir Arthur. It seems the British have won another bloodless victory. I take it you?ve now unanimously decided to stay? I shall report in my diary that the first vote was 9 to 1 and that in a friendly spirit it was then decided to make the decision unanimous. Well, then it's decided gentlemen, I suggest we call in the military. This way please, gentlemen. Sir, Colonel Shiba will give the majority report. Considering the military aspects of the situation, we have agreed that with fewer than 400 men, to defend a perimeter of over 2 miles, the position is untenable. We recommend immediate evacuation. The Ministers have decided that for political reasons, we must remain. So you would have to defend the area to the best of you abilities until Admiral Sydney's relieving force arrives. Sir, what if the relief column doesn?t make it? They have to cover over 70 miles through hostile territory. We will consider that situation if and when it arises. We have 5 main defense sectors. The wall defended by the Germans and the Americans, the west end defended by the Russians, the British Legation, the Fu, held by the Americans and the Japanese, and the east end of Legation Street, is held by the Italians and the French. - Boxers? - Yeah. Where are they? Where the hell are they? They are all around us. Don't be nervous. It's their purpose. Once the shooting starts, you?ll see them. Everyone of them will be outside that wall. Who's nervous? No! No, you can't have them! But Sarah, we agreed. We need the books for the barricades. I thought you'd be the first to understand. Not the complete set of the Napoleonic Wars. Mother just sent them to you for your birthday. I have a confession to make. French history bores me. English history? Bah! - Go away. The shop is closed. - it's Baroness Ivanoff. I thought all doors in Peking have been closed to me, that I'd lost face in the Chinese streets. Our Empress has those same fears, Baroness. Boxers. It is hoped her wisdom will prevail. I have your message, old one. Your friend thinks you should leave Peking. - What friend, old one? - General Yung-Lo. It was not possible before. Your husband's brother would have accused us of meddling in Russian affairs. And now? Now... it makes no difference. There will be a Boxer attack. If you should disappear in the first confusion, who would be left to point a finger. At 5 o'clock this afternoon, the fighting will have begun. You will meet a man at the corner of the French Legation. He?ll be wearing green peasant jacket. You will be there? Ervie, go up on the ramp and find out how they're coming. Yes, sir. Well, it's all we've got. Sergeant, make those men get their backs into it. Right! - Hey, what the ... - Hold it. - Where do you think you're going? - I?m getting out of Peking. Don't you know there are some angry Boxers out there. They're not angry with me. We have almost 200 rounds a piece, Major. - That's 20 rounds each man each day. - 20 rounds. That's for warming up. You tell 'em, they'd better start out warm. Yes, sir. I?ll tell them. Start out warm. Will you get out of there before I get mad? Mad Americans inside, mad Boxers outside, mad Russians all over the place ... I?ll take my chances outside. Major, I split the men in 2 platoons. 4 hours on, 4 hours off. The sergeant will take the first watch, you take the second. Right. I wanted to go to Tientsin with you. But you want to stay here and play soldier. I wear a uniform. That's the job they pay me to do. Well then, go and do it. And get out of my way. Have a nice war, soldier, a real nice war. Where do these go, Major? Now, where do you think they go? Get up on that wall! Fire! I will leave! Let's go! Forward march! - Cease firing. - Cease firing. We did it! We beat them! What do we do if they come back? We used more than half our ammunition today. How good are you with a slingshot? A friend of yours, Baroness? Soldier. Can you open this door? Well, you can't go through there, ma'am. There are Chinese on the other side. That was a bit of bad luck. - It?ll be all right. - I?ll get some help. - Well, what do you make of her, Major? - Well father, this is quite a weapon. What would you call it? Well, you might say she's a cross between an alligator and an ostrich. But we call her Betsy, after the Dowager Empress of China. We found this old German gun barrel and some Russian shells of approximately the same caliber. The gun carriage is Italian, and the wheels are French. And that boy over there is fool enough say you fire it. I wonder if it will be safer in front or in the back? The point is, where is Betsy going to be fired? - Sir. Captain Marshall wants you. - What's up? Chinese are on top of the wall, Sir. That's what's up, Sir. - Well, now we know where Betsy goes. - You! Over here you! Get it. Run! Cone on, Andy, run! Sergeant, get in here. Take cover. Damn it! Alright. What happened? We tried. There were just too many of them. They keep right on coming. Major Lewis. - How many did we lose? - Turner got it. So did Spencer. 5 wounded. I don't know about the Germans. I guess they got it even worse. I don't know why don?t they rush us right now? We wouldn?t stand a chance here. Maybe they think we?ve got millions of men and tonnes of ammunition. Well hell, come morning, they'll think different. They?ll roll down those ramps like Niagara Falls. We gotta get them off this wall. We can't. Andy, if they stay there, they can shoot down into the whole Legation area. Like fish in a barrel. Either we get them off the wall or we might just as well open the gates and let them in. You get the French priest and meet us in the Legation. Right. I don't think they gonna start anything up here till morning, Sergeant. And you better hope they don?t. - No sign of activity, hmm? - No, sir. I think they're all asleep. Well, we'd better not be, Sergeant. - You'd better wake them all up. - Yes, sir. Wake up. Good morning. Bonsieur, bonsieur. Borjono. Good morning. Good morning. Here they come! Keep going! Come on. Keep going! Andy, get down. Maybe you can tell me one thing, Major. What are we doing here? - Why didn?t we get out when we could? - I don?t know, Harry. I really don?t know. Captain Handley tell me that you re-took the wall. I suppose you heard... He died too. Maybe the Minister can tell us why the Captain's dead. And Captain Marshall. From what I hear, he has all the answers. That's all, sergeant. Get on back. He's a good soldier when he knows what he?s fighting for. It's easier when it's something you can see... a wall, a hill, a river. But how can you explain to them when it's for a principle? You can't. Not here in China. It's too far from home. I know. I wont stay. No! I won't stay! Don?t let them to take my leg. I won't let them take my leg! Please! Tell them. Hold on, soldier. Hold on. I don?t want to live half a man. He's already fainted. You can go now. Can you save his leg? May I stay here with him? Your dress is a breeding ground for germs. Well, what are you waiting for? Get rid of it and put on a uniform. Thank you, doctor. Who's gonna tell her? The captain's little girl, remember. Well, it's pretty late now. I guess we gonna tell her in the morning. She might hear about it from somebody else. That wouldn't be right. No, I guess not. - Let's get a drink first. - Afterwards. You coming? - I gotta get back on the wall. - Wait a minute. All right. Where will I find her? With the rest of the orphans, in the Fu. What do I tell her? Like she was your own, I guess. Tell her like you'd like someone to tell your own kid. - Don't you know which one she is? - No. There are so many new children who just came in today. Haven?t you have met her? Yeah once, but ... I can't remember what she looks like. I didn?t pay much attention. Ah, Major. Look, we're looking for the Marshall girl. Ah, of course. Yes, Teresa ... I heard. I guess she must be sleeping, eh? Maybe you could tell her in the morning. Well, I think it's important that you tell her, Major. After all, she knows that you were her father's friend. I'll wake her. Ah, here she is. Here's someone to see you. A friend of your father's. Teresa... Do you ... - Do you remember me? - Yes, Major. I have something to tell you. Now why don?t the two of you stay here and talk? I guess you know there's been some fighting. Some ... I just said I have something that I have to tell you. Is it about my father? Yes. Is he dead? Did you know? Well ... You knew he was a soldier. It could have happened any time. You?ll be taken care of. You won't have to worry about anything. Now, I'll... I guess you?ll be all right now, huh? Won't I be going home then? Home? To America. He said he'd take me home. He did? When? Every time. And just today again. Well I... I don't think you'd like it there. Everything's very strange. Things are all different there. The people, and the food, and the houses, the schools. Anyway, if you want, we can talk about it some more you know, few days, when things quiet down. I promise. All right. All right. Think she understood? When a mother dies, a child feels deserted. When a father goes away, even for the best reasons a child feels abandoned. Teresa's had more than her fair share. She understands too well. I don't know what else I could have told her? There's only one language a child understands. Love. Well, she's not mine. Someone, somewhere said that every man is the father of every child. But I suppose that it's only true if you really feel it. The British Admiral and his forces are trapped between Langfang and Anping. The Boxers do not climb a tree to look for a fish. They have done their work well. The railway is destroyed before him and to his rear. He can neither proceed nor retreat. You see, General, the Boxers are not as useless as you believed. Your Majesty, it does not require courage or skill to rip up a few rails. The Boxers flee from the foreign devils. If Admiral Sydney be denied the use of the railway, he will now march on Peking. I expect him here within the week. It is true, Your Majesty. The Boxers are not equipped to stop such a well armed force. Only General Yung-Lo's Imperial troops can do that. The Imperial troops have no part in this foolish uprising. The Imperial troops will do as Her Majesty commands. Who is the ...? Who can make muddy water clear? Your Majesty. First, we were told that the Boxers would destroy all the foreigners in Peking within two days. Next, we were assured that no foreign army would ever even approach the city. If we commit the Imperial Army against Admiral Sydney, we shall be declaring war on all the Powers. Our armies, for all their courage and devotion, could not possibly win such a war. The Boxers have created an opportunity for a great Chinese victory. If our troops destroy the foreign forces, it will prove to all the world that China is no longer helpless. It will be the beginning of freedom. Each of you speaks with the voice of a patriot. Prince Tuan counsels a reckless adventure, General Yung-Lo counsels prudence and patience. Prudence and patience for what? China's condition can be no worse than it is. Even if we should start a war and lose it, what more can the Powers take from us? General Yung-Lo, you will personally command our troops and turn back the foreign armies. Stop it, Tommy. - Go away, Tommy. You?ll wake the baby. - You can't talk. You're dead. - Bang bang bang. - You're not to play at that end. Bang bang! Oh, Tommy! Bang bang! Uggh! Tommy! Mummy! Mummy! Mummy! They got Tommy! Mummy. If he dies, he wouldn't ever been home. Funny how he used to talk about home, as if he remembered how it was. How he said the ducks was in James Park. Odd. He must have picked it up from me. You never talked to him about home, did you Arthur? Yes I did, sometimes. You know I ... I have the strangest feeling, I can't get it out of my mind. What? What is it? Do you think if a child dies in a foreign place without ever having been home, that his soul doesn?t rest? I think it goes into limbo. An enormous, empty Chinese limbo. And it wonders their loss and crime. - He?s not going to die. - Then why doesn?t he waken up? The doctor says he's in a coma. He may not come around for several days. The truth is, he may not come round at all. He may never come out of it. Why? Why? Whom did he sin? Against whom? What's he doing in this foreign place? Whose ambition is he serving? Must a child die to serve the ends of ambitious and powerful men? Who will gain from his death? Who would be the happier for it? How many children must die? How many people must suffer, before there is an end to all this? Don't you see that even the life of one child is too great a price to pay. It's too great a price to pay! - Sarah, try to understand - Understand what? Tell me! The pain is not yours alone. Have you ever been to England, Baroness? Yes. Manchester? No. Must be very beautiful? Don't think you'd call it beautiful. But, you know how it is, when you come from a far place. Go to sleep now. You might dream of Manchester. It would be like a visit home. Count Litnoff is a second cousin to the Czarina. You cannot treat him like a common soldier. The bullet that hit him was not afraid of wounding a Count. The germs in his wound do not care if he's the first cousin of the Czarina. He will be treated the same as any man in this hospital. Good day, Baron. I understand you are here early and late. A true angel of mercy. - The wounded man won't be... - Quiet! ... nursed by anyone else. You've always known, that I have a way with men, Sergei. Even the German doctor has fallen under your spell. He can't do without me. And the Major? The American Major? What do you want? I would like to be present when he finds out what you are. You?ll be present. You?ll be the one who tells him. You're just waiting for the right moment. Where? Where is it? Right there. Open it up. There you are, Sir Arthur. I've got a message for you from Admiral Sydney. Good to see you, Reverend Michaelson. Oh, dear dear. Now, where have I put it? I hope I didn't lose it. - Where did you see Admiral Sydney? - One thing at a time, Sir. Here it is. It's in code. I?ll have to get it deciphered. Come with me. With a mixed force of 2,200 officers and men I proceeded by rail as far as Anping. There I encountered heavy opposition from large forces of Chinese Imperial troops. I sustained casualties of over 10 percent and considerable loss of material. It was impossible to continue toward Peking. I have been forced to order a retreat along the Peiho River toward Tientsin. - 'Signed, Harold Sydney'. - Why doesn't it say something ...? What did he say? You missed you dinner. I thought you should have something to eat. Thank you, Sarah. - Do you want some more light? - No, thanks. Why are we here, Sarah? You asked me that once. Why did we stay? We could have gone. I?m sorry. I've got no right to put it that way. Well, there comes a time when it's good to ask questions. I've been lying here for hours asking myself many. What questions? Question. Who am I? Question. What have I accomplished in 20 years in the Foreign Service? Question. Am I a successful diplomat, or a misfit, suitable only for a backwater like Peking? Question. Am I an honest man who tried to avert war in China, or am I an ambitious man who sought to further his own career? Question. Am I a fool who took an impossible gamble, or a reasonable man who took a reasonable chance. I mean what sort of father and husband am I to risk everything that I love? And who am I to play God with the precious lives of so many people? I've been with you, Arthur, as long as you've been with the Foreign Service. I know something about those 20 years, and something about you. I know that only an honest man would ask such questions. - Excellency. - I was just leaving, Major. The Baroness and I were talking over old time. Don?t go. My brother-in-law can't rest. He has something to tell you. This is a family matter, Natasha. We needn't discuss it before strangers. Stop playing games, Sergei. Get it over with, now! We are talking about my dead brother, the Baroness's husband. I'm really not interested. What kind of a man you supposed he was? Something like me? Fat, past middle age? Something like that. He was the youngest Colonel in the Russian army. A brilliant career ahead of him. The Czar himself had taken personal notice. Do you know why my brother died? No. Go on. I can't go on ... It suddenly seems... He killed himself because I was unfaithful to him. Let's forget it. The man was a General. A Chinese General. Can you imagine yourself in love with a Chinese girl. That's not the same, is it? Well, I guess a man gets what he deserves. What the hell can I offer? A soldier's pay? Yes. Well, a soldier's pay buys a soldier's woman. An urgent message from Her Imperial Highness. And therefore, in view of the unprovoked aggression by the armed forces of Great Britain, Germany, Russia, France, the United States, Japan, Italy and Austria, under the command of Admiral Harold Sydney, the Imperial Chinese Government demands the immediate and unconditional surrender of the armed forces of these nations in Peking. And the surrender of all their weapons. We will await your reply. I believe, Sir Arthur, I can say without fear of contradiction, that you are the architect of our dilemma. What do you propose now? I think gentlemen, you should know the military facts. We have had almost 100 casualties, about 25% of our forces. Our ammunition is more than half gone, the food situation is bad, medical supplies are non-existent, and by any reasonable estimate it will take 4 or 5 weeks to assemble a sufficient force on the coast to fight through to Peking. What is your answer to that? We are all very well aware of our own weakness. I have been giving some thought to the weakness of the Chinese. It's quite clear that Prince Tuan persuaded the Empress to commit the Imperial troops in hopes of a quick and easy victory. It's also clear that he allowed Reverend Michaelson through the lines with Sydney's letter, in the hopes that we will promptly collapse. This ultimatum means that he has promised the Empress our immediate surrender. Now, if instead of collapsing we show unexpected strength, and not only hold out, but attack, at the very moment when they least expected, we might destroy Tuan's influence with the Empress and force her to face reality. I believe this colleague is a man of faith. He believes that if we blow our trumpets, it may cause the walls of the imperial city to collapse. Like the walls of Jericho. How many trumpets do we have, Major? I don?t know, Baron, but ... I think maybe Sir Arthur has a good idea about the Empress. About the Empress, I hope you do not misunderstand any attempt on her life would be a disaster. I wouldn?t even know how to go about getting out of here. I do not want her killed. You don't want! Her death would mean chaos. We'd have no one with whom we could negotiate. We'd be fighting here in China for 20 years. Do you have a better idea? I give you my word, Major. It would only increase offense to the Chinese and enlarge the war. Alright, you fight the wars. Just let us fight the battles, will you? Come on, Colonel. - What do you think, Colonel? - This a ... I?m thinking ... if you're thinking what I think you're thinking, and then ... I?m afraid ... I must agree with Sir Arthur. They're using the big guns now. That means the Empress has committed the Imperial troops. Get everyone into the compound. Here Sergeant, take the baby. Arthur, Tommy's all right! He's all right. He just woke up. He spoke to me. He's going to live! - He's going to live! - Live? Well, you wanted to avoid a war and we got a war. You thought we could wait for Admiral Sydney. Sydney is not coming. Now you think we should attack. Attack who? The whole Imperial Army? And attack with what? 115 rusty guns? I just got word that Tuan is preparing an enormous victory celebration for the Empress in the Imperial Courtyard for tonight. I suppose we're all invited? I still say that we should do something instead of surrendering, something that will make Tuan lose face. Well, we could blow up the palace. You know the Chinese have a very well stocked arsenal not too far away from Imperial City. - What happened to that ... - I know about that. Right in the middle of their little party. I also know it's a mile and a half through their lines. I'm not talking about going through their line, I'm talking about going underneath them. - How? - Look at your map. I think we can get to that house by way of the sewer. And blow the whole thing up just when Tuan is telling the Empress that the foreign devils are completely defeated. Right through here. Of course, how to get back again is another question. We... This couldn't take a military genius, Major, to crawl through a sewer. They've got us cut off. If that goes off now, we?ll be blown sky high. I?ve got to cut the fuse. It's too short. If we light it now, we'll never get clear. Get these two ends joined together. I suppose Prince Tuan you have come to report the complete destruction of the Legations. This will be the tenth time since the end of the last moon. I have come, Divine One, to ask Your Majesty's permission to impeach General Yung-Lo as a traitor and a friend to the barbarians. It is true he turned back the foreign admiral, but he has guns the Boxers need, and he refuses to lend these guns, even though Your Majesty commands. Be silent. General Yung-Lo. Despite the empty promises of the Boxers, the foreign devils grow stronger each day. Even the Forbidden City is no longer safe. There is no greater calamity than to underestimate an enemy. You will speak to the foreigners, Yung-Lo. You will explain to them there is no greater blessing than peace and no greater calamity than lightly engaging in war. Looks like they've called off the war, Major? Throw down the line. Here, what have we got? It's a message for each of the Ministers from General Yung-Lo. Seems they want a truce. We really must have spoiled the Empress's party last night. She's just as likely to wake up in the morning and decide it's a fine day to finish us off. What does she say? 'We are greatly disturbed by the arrival of allied troops at the city of Tientsin'. Tientsin? Unless these troops are withdrawn immediately, the Chinese government will consider it an act of war and will commit forces of the Imperial Army' Allied troops in Tientsin. Apparently, but they must think we're all dead here by now. That's only 70 miles away. Yes. If only we could get word to them. You mean if I could get word to them. Oh, no. Old soldiers never volunteer. Natalie. I?m going away. - When? - Right now. I?m waiting for you, Baroness. - Where are you going? - To try and get some help. Patient is waiting for you! This is not a reception hall into Winter palace. Are you coming back? Sure, if I can. Natasha! Listen ... What does he want? Do you think people can change, doctor? I don't know. That is something I can't study under a microscope. - You look wonderful. You shaved. - You always noticed, Baroness. Get me some adhesive, please. I?m going now. You said that. Yeah, I know but ... So long. Wait a minute. We never did get a chance to talk, did we? Look, I have to go some place but... I?m coming back. Like my father. I?m coming back. We'll talk then. All right? Come on. Should have another bottle of ether. Where is it? - You say that every day, doctor. - Because I know there was one. We used it over a week ago. - And the morphine? - it's all gone. You know it. Well, tomorrow we?ll have to operate on the Italian regardless. If he's lucky, he will faint and feel nothing. Iodine. Here, doctor. This is empty! Oh, I?m sorry. Now, don?t stand here. Get me another bottle. Oh, but this was the last bottle. No alcohol, no iodine, amateur nurses ... We're in the ... back in the Dark Ages. No ether for anesthetics, no morphine for pain. We are in the land of opium and there are no opiates. Look out! Rogers, are you all right? Major, I?m hurt. I'm hurt bad. I?ll get you back. There's death in the weather, old man, and yet your door is open. The door open or closed, cannot protect either of us. A life ... and death, old man. Are they important? Not to the gods. There are many men dying. In pain. They need drugs. I do not deal in opiates. There are others in the city who do. The Chinese outside the walls are the only ones who can help you now, Baroness. Even in war times, old man, a valuable gift placed high enough can work miracles. I want the drugs today. And a wagon loaded with fruit for the children. It's alright, Charlie. We'll just rest here at ... Okay. Take it away. All right, open it up! How did you do it, Baroness? Hold your positions. The truce is over! It's all right. We made it. Get him to the hospital. - I didn?t make it. - I heard. Major, I heard you were back. Scatter, go on. Major. Major, wake up! Wake up! The rails ... The railroad tracks are much closer. Yeah. - How close are they? - Almost up to the wall. All right. Get me a shirt. - Did they tell you about the Baroness? - No. She was shot. What? I think she'll be alright though. She's in the hospital. Major, we'd better hurry. Yeah... Yeah. Please don?t take it so hard, doctor. You must let me try again, Natasha. Soon it will be too late. You?ve done everything you can do. I must locate the focus of the infection. You wont find it with a knife, doctor. Don?t you want to live? I have lived. Don?t think back. Don't think of anything now, except of living. Give yourself a chance. A chance? A chance for what? A chance to do it all over again? No, thank you, doctor. If you die, Natasha, all the light will be gone from this place. No. You're the one ... who makes all the light in this place. I hope you will forgive me when I say ... that in the weeks we have worked together I have learned to care for you very much. I?m glad you said that, Hans. A woman always like to hear it. Most men haven?t the courage to say it. Hell, they're sure closer than they were when I left. If they were planning on bringing up a big gun, they wouldn?t come this close. Yeah. Go get Father de Bearn. Yes, sir. So what is it, Major? Did you ever see anything like that before? I certainly have not. You can't stop that with rifles. Gotta stop it with something. Get me those two bronze urns from the tower there. And all the coal oil you can find, and some black powder. And all the empty champagne bottles you can find too. Alright now, put it down here, and not down there. Pile up these sandbags. Come on, higher than that. That's about it. Now where are those bottles and the powder? Come on, hurry! That's it. Well, a little prayer and a lot of luck ... Bad luck. Bad luck, indeed. You weren?t praying hard enough. Now! Knock it on those soldiers will you. What's wrong is there? I'll try harder, next time. It must be terrible to be a soldier, Major. Yeah ... Sometimes it is. I've been looking for you. The Baroness is dead. Don't you have anything to say? She didn?t mean much to you, did she? Shut up! - Sorry. - Let me alone! Let me alone! I just heard. I?m so sorry. Damn! Well, we bought ourselves another day, anyway. Still, it wasn?t a bad fight, you know. What time is it? 5.37 a.m. August 14th, 1900. How many days did we hold out? Fifty-five. Those guns! They're not Chinese! Strange! They're ours! It's the relief force! They're ours! They're ours! They're ours! Water can support a ship. And water can upset it. The dynasty is finished. Listen to them. They're all playing different tunes again. Well, for 55 days we played the same tune. Fifty-five days you held us together. You started something at that. Maybe people will remember it for some day. - We're ready to march, Major. - Right with you. Will you be staying on in China? Oh, I go where they send me. How about you? Oh, I?ll be going home to England. Retired to private life, I suppose. A little place in the country with a dog and a few good books. Every Englishman's dream, really. And you, what's home for you? I don?t know. I may have to make one yet. Good luck, Matt. Right shoulder... arms! Here, take my hand. Forward ho!
