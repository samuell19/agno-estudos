THEY CARRY DEATH Everything else is lost! He said there'd be wood, but I see nothing but stones. You should have stayed on the boat then. I'm not going to stay on this island. The sail and a few logs will be enough to get us home. If we find some. Shut up and keep watch. Soon they will come for the sail. Columbus will never leave without it. Come on! Bartolomé! My legs are aching. Stop complaining so much, boy. You can't even grow a beard yet and all you do is complain. He cries a lot for someone who was a prisoner. It's because he's in love. Take another one. How many times have you been here? How many times did you stop here? Many. And with Columbus? And you want to plant those here? I could... But they would take too long to grow. By the time they're big and flowering I'd be far away from here. At home. They didn't stop. They didn't stop. They daren't leave without the sail. Put that out. Sometimes I don't understand a word he says. How do we get off this island? Did you hear that? Hear what? I heard a noise. I don't hear anything. Well, I think I heard something. Listen. Fire. What have you done, my sister? What have you done? What would make you do something like that? You're still so young. What were you thinking? You haven't lived your life yet. You will grow up. You'll discover the world. You will love again. You will get well. This woman will know how to heal you. We aren't far. Be strong. I'm going to find the path. You stay here with her. My God, help me. Help us. Where are you? Please. Come back. Come back to me. Where are you? He got into a fight with many people and a man ended up dead. He was blamed for it and they sentenced him to death. If the law didn't do it the dead man's family would have. - Yes... - They were going to kill him either way. When they went to execute him, they offered to let him get on a boat to get lost at sea, where no-one else wanted to go. He accepted. Right. They would cross the sea until they reached another land. - Yes. - Do you remember him? No, I don't. That kid, who worked with our father. He was always with us. You really don't remember him? I don't remember. You don't remember him? He got on that boat to save his life. I don't remember. It's been a long time since they left on a trip to I don't know which land, beyond the end of the world. It stinks. Go to sleep, Telmo. They are there! Come on, Telmo! Let's go! Up! Xoán, the sail! It's what they want! Pull it up! We can't go on without it! To hell with it! Hurry up. This wood is very porous. It's almost rotten already. But it looks tough. It's no good. Look, up there. See those trees? We should look over there, it will be drier. Here are some footprints! Here! Xoán, stop it! Stop it. They are close. Where? They will hear us. Bartolomé! We have to get out of here. What are you doing standing there? We have nowhere to go. It's Christopher Columbus. Maybe Christopher Columbus' head was never cut off. The Spanish extended their power over the Canary Islands by subduing its inhabitants, of whom only a few traces remain. Then, they continued their journey to the other side of the ocean carrying death to another land. They called it the "New World". Meanwhile, in the Old World, in those mountains on the edge of the Atlantic, there were women who remained in their homes. In the middle of the forest. For a long time. That's how they began talking to the trees, to the sea, to the animals... The men returned to their land and found that they no longer recognized these women, and they tried them as witches. We measure this land painfully, but we stomp on it with our feet always saying: What do you hold deep inside? What secrets? What mysteries? You give us back the seed we entrusted to you. But you don't return that human seed, those beloved dead that we have lent you. Will our friends not bloom again, the loved ones we left behind? If, only for an hour, for a moment, they could return to us.
