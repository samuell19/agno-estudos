[music playing] [phone ringing] [beeping] [siren] EVA: Mm, hmm, hey, there. Hey, baby. Mm, I have a confession to make. Yeah, what's that? Well, my name is not really Roxanne. - Really? - Really. Mm-hmm. It's Eva. Guess what, baby? What? My name is not really Sly. [giggles] I feel like we've met somewhere before. I just moved here. Well, I-- I didn't actually mean met, exactly. I just-- OK, you're gonna think this sounds really stupid. But it just, kind of, feels like I've known you from somewhere else. Come on, come on, come on. Tell me you didn't feel that, huh? I don't believe in all that past life shit. [sighs] Where are you going? I'm going home. [chuckles] I see. You've had your fun, didn't you? Hey, baby, look, you were the one who wanted to get together in the first place. Yeah, I just didn't think you'd blow out of here like this. Hey, baby, look, we had a great time. It was terrific, fireworks and all. But you know what, don't ruin it. Well, maybe it was fireworks for you. But I'm still sitting here waiting, little man. Shit. Little man? You fucking slut. What is up with you, Sly, huh? Can't you had a real woman? What is it, huh? Oh, you're a real woman? Here you go, real woman. Take that because that's about all your worth. - You son of a bitch! - What? What are you gonna do? What are you-- huh? - Get your face off me. - What? Get the fuck off! Oh, God. [screams] [crashes] Let go of me, go of me! Fucking shit! [cries] [screams] What a bitch! [door closes] [crying] MICHAEL: This is a job and a half. [cat purrs] Hey, how did you get in here, huh? You don't belong in here. I don't know why you insist on being nice to that stray. She's become attached. She's lonely. Great, another mouth to feed. Well, she can catch mice. We don't have mice. Well, see that? She's already earned her keep. Honey-- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. [grunts] I've got a great idea, let's paint. I appreciate the help. I am not an invalid. I can handle this if there's something else that you would rather do. Actually, there is something I would rather do. Why don't you, me, and squirt go snuggle, and we'll hire somebody to do this. But we're already up to our eyeballs in bills as it is. I'll glue, you hang. I'll hang, you glue. There we go, right there. Is that on straight-- [cat growls] Oh! - Damn it, Michael! - It's OK. I'll clean it up. I'll clean it up. I'll do it. Do you want me to get the mop? No, thank you. Is there some work that you can go do? You OK? You see, I-- I think we're spending too much on the TV airtime. Why don't we see if we can move some of this over to print? I'll get right on it. HEATHER: Damn it. What's wrong with this thing? The system's screwing up again. MICHAEL: I thought we just had this thing fixed? HEATHER: We did. ARCHIE: Let me try logging back on. That's your screen name? Brick? - What? I want a little pizzazz. The girls really dig it. It's not entirely a lie. I think a mason did this hair. ARCHIE: Do you think I'm thrilled my parents named me Archie? Besides, on the internet, I could be anybody I want. In fact, in the lesbian chat room, my name is Charice. HEATHER: We've gotta get a new programmer. Every time Walter brings that guy in, he just screws things up more. Do you really meet women this way? Are you kidding? You should have heard this chick last night, Lola. HEATHER: Heck, do you hear yourself? As long as you think of women as chicks, you're always going to be a loser. ARCHIE: Be careful. If your temper gets too hot, the ice in your veins will melt. MICHAEL: All right, guys, come on-- oh, excuse me, persons, can I get some help here? If we lose this account, we're screwed. [machine beeps] Oh, there it goes again. MICHAEL: Hey, Walter! - I-- I quit. Give me a gun. I'm gonna-- - Hi, Michael. - Hey, Eleanor. What's up? Oh, we've got the first part on the print. Did you want to see them? - Not right now. Pop them on my desk. ELEANOR: OK. Hey, Walter, that programmer doesn't know his-- oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were in a meeting. That's all right. I'd like you to meet Kenji Brooks. Call me Ken. Tornado Footwear. That's right. How are you? Very good, sir. Anderson here is one of our brightest account executives. Oh. Right, Anderson? Yeah, right, sir. Tornado is looking for a new image. Yes, we've been losing market share to all those hip, new brands that all the kids are going for. Absolutely. What was it you wanted, Anderson? I'll take care of it, sir. It was great meeting you, Mr. Brooks. I'm so glad we found somebody who knows what they're doing. EVA: The server was overloaded by too many users. I'm sorry, what-- what does that mean? Basically, it just got confused and gave up. So I am creating a brain program that prioritizes your requests. Then I will bundle the software into-- into groups that-- into groups that run independently. MICHAEL: So that other guy pretty much screwed everything up, didn't he? Nah, I tend to work from a different perspective than most programmers. I'd like to think computers are a lot like people. They get overworked. They get run down. They have personalities. [giggles] You sound more like a philosopher than a technician. [laughs] Yeah, this probably sounds pretty stupid to you, huh? No. No, not at all. You're a thinker. Just a hell of a lot more than I can say for that other guy. And you got the brains and the beauty. Hey, the next time you're in the office, stop by and say hello. It's Eva, right? Yeah, yeah. Hey, [chuckles] what time do you have? What? It's-- it's quarter to 2:00-- no, it's 10 to 2:00. This darn watch always runs five minutes slow no matter how much I wind it. It's kind of like me, I guess. [laughs] Bye. Mr. Barack called from Europe and says it's urgent. WALTER: Yeah, I'll get back to him. ELEANOR: OK. Hey, Walter-- WALTER: And the vultures descend. [chuckles] So who's the exec on this account? Haven't you got enough on your plate already? Pretty soon, they're going to be calling this place Anderson Advertising. Well, I've been meaning to talk to you about that. Hey. Come on, you said yourself, one of the brightest execs of this company. You just used the keyword, one. So? So, we're going to do what we always do. We're going to put our heads together and let the best man run with it. Excuse me? [music playing] Surprise! EMILY: What are you doing home early? I decided to take off early. There will be no cooking this evening for the mother of my child because the French chef has arrived. Tonight, we're going to make a lovely little-- Michael, come on, cut it out. What, I thought we'd have a nice romantic French dinner together? I just have a lot of work to do. Besides, I'm fat. You-- you are not fat. You are beautiful, so beautiful. Michael, I'm grading papers. Did I-- did I do something? What do you mean? Emily, I'm starting to feel like I got the plague here. Micheal. No, because if I did, just tell me what it was. And I promise you, I won't do it anymore. I'm just very busy. Yeah, I know you've been busy. You've been busy with the baby, with the papers, with the wallpaper, with work. Honey, it's all starting to sound like a big excuse. Michael, please don't do this. No, you-- you've been distant lately. You don't talk to me. You've abandoned every single one of your friends. It's ridiculous. I have plenty of friends. No, you don't, Emily. You don't seem to have room in your life for anyone anymore, except the baby. Honey, would you talk to me, please? It's nothing. OK, fine. EMILY: Where are you going? I-- I left something back at the office. [door closes] [car engine starts] [mail alarm] EVA (VOICEOVER): This may sound silly, I've never done anything like this before. But I wanted to get to know you. And if you're interested, let me know, Roxanne, your secret admirer. Archie, you're such an idiot. [chuckles] [beeps] EVA (VOICEOVER): Aren't you a little curious? MICHAEL: Hello, Archie. EVA (VOICEOVER): I'd be missing a few parts if my name was Archie. MICHAEL (VOICEOVER): What's the matter? Lola stand you up or something? EVA (VOICEOVER): Who's Lola? MICHAEL (VOICEOVER): Just quit fooling around, Archie, I've got work to do. EVA (VOICEOVER): I'm not Archie. MICHAEL (VOICEOVER): Then who are you? EVA (VOICEOVER): Your secret admirer. Didn't you get my email? MICHAEL (VOICEOVER): But Archie put you up to this, right? EVA (VOICEOVER): If I told you that, I wouldn't be your secret admirer, now would I? I totally disagree. The Bulls will never pull it off. [chuckles] MICHAEL (VOICEOVER): You are so out of your mind. They're having their best season ever. Hey, listen, do you want to put money on it? I'll go for it. Let's do it. EVA (VOICEOVER): Trust me. [laughs] Women have instincts about these things. MICHAEL (VOICEOVER): Oh, I see. Now why is it that every time a woman starts to lose an argument, she suddenly pulls that instinct thing? [laughs] EVA (VOICEOVER): I'm not losing. I'm just trying to give you a chance to back down gracefully. This may sound strange, but I feel like we've met before. MICHAEL (VOICEOVER): I was thinking the same thing. EVA (VOICEOVER): Are you married? MICHAEL (VOICEOVER): No. [phone rings] Mike Anderson. Aren't you coming home? MICHAEL (ON PHONE): Yeah, honey, I'm sorry. I got a little lost in my work here. I'll-- I'll be home very soon. I have to go. Thank you. EVA (VOICEOVER): Not necessary. MICHAEL (VOICEOVER): Yes, it is. It's-- it's nice to be able to talk to somebody. Good morning, your Majesty. It's so nice of you to make it. Oh, good morning, good morning. We have 10 minutes. Hey, Arch, tell your friend, Roxanne, I thought she was a great sport. Huh? Huh? Your friend, Roxanne, my secret admirer. I'm completely lost. I got this letter on my computer from this girl who said she wanted to meet me. Now, I don't know why, but I just assumed that you had something to do with it. It wasn't me, bucko. - Really? - What? Me give you a girl? What am I, crazy? I wonder who it was. I don't know. Hey, what about Eleanor? She's always giving you that look. She's a schoolgirl. Hence the term, "schoolgirl crush." No, she seemed older. Wait, you mean you talked to her? Yeah, I talked to her, a little, over the computer. Oh, you dog. You are my hero. Hey, did you make a date with her? No. Well, can I? No! ARCHIE: Oh, so I'm not entitled to find love, thank you. EVA (VOICEOVER): Dear Michael, I enjoyed talking to you so much the other day. I think it would be great if we could get to know each other better. You seemed so gentle, so sweet. I'd bet you'd be a great lover. I think about the things I would do to you, exploring your body, feeling you. I wonder what it would be like. [music playing] Our bodies pressed together, melting, becoming one, the heat rising, taking us to a place where no one exists but the two of us. And then the sweet release. And then we fall asleep. ARCHIE: And then the sweet release, and we fall asleep wrapped in the safety of each other. Can you believe this? Man, where can I meet someone like that? Who is this chick? It applies. She says she's my secret admirer. This woman is serious. I can't imagine myself writing a letter like that in a million years. Wee, big surprise. Michael, you must have said something to lead her on. I-- I was being nice. That was your first mistake. What are you talking about? Don't you realize that women go their whole lives looking for that nice guy? We meet guys like you all the time. Really? Maybe I should try it. It's too late for you. Please, she wants me so bad. It's pathetic. [buzzer] MAN: Hi. Hello. Can I help you? Yes. Actually, I am looking for a specific watch. MAN: Mm-hmm. Could I see that-- the silver one with the dark face-- Sure. --right over there, please? Great. Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah, I think this is perfect. I'll take this. Sure. If you like it, I make the engraving for you. OK, let's do it. That's it. I'm finished. I'm going home. I'm exhausted, goodbye. Five more minutes. You've been saying that all day. What, are you afraid to go home or something? Actually, yeah. Emily's been a little hormonal lately. Well, it's perfectly understandable, especially after what happened last year with her losing the baby and all. Thanks. I'm sorry. I'm an idiot. [sighs] It's OK. I just-- I just wish there was something I could do to help her. Like staying away from home? Listen, as we both know, I am no authority when it comes to relationships. But what good is it going to do to keep running away, huh? MICHAEL: So the whole look is like a video game, ties in perfectly with a product name, Torpedo, target the major markets, cover the urban youth. Walter, you've got a surefire winner right here. It seems like you've covered all the bases. It's a keeper, Walt. I think that it's a little adolescent. Oh, that's exactly who we're going after, Heather. HEATHER: Walter, all of the athletic shoes go for the youth market. I think that we should take a more sophisticated approach. I think we should go a little bit more upscale, a little subdued sex, some humor, target all of that yuppie, disposable income, create a nice little niche. She has a point. Heather, why don't you work this up, then you'll make the presentation to Brooks next week. [sighs] [music playing] [crying] Honey, what's wrong? Hold me. It's OK. It's OK. We are not going to lose this one, honey. Everything is going to work out. [mail alarm] EVA (VOICEOVER): Hi. [sighs] MICHAEL (VOICEOVER): I worked so damn hard on that campaign. EVA (VOICEOVER): So you're angry. There's nothing wrong with that. MICHAEL (VOICEOVER): I'm just-- I'm being ridiculous here. I shouldn't be boring you with all of this. EVA (VOICEOVER): What are friends for. MICHAEL (VOICEOVER): I guess I just don't want to lead you on. I mean, how far can this go, talking over the computer? EVA (VOICEOVER): Then maybe we should stop doing this over the computer. MICHAEL (VOICEOVER): What do you mean? EVA (VOICEOVER): You can't say that you haven't fantasized about me. MICHAEL (VOICEOVER): Oh, no, I can't say that. EVA (VOICEOVER): Like what? MICHAEL (VOICEOVER): I don't think I should tell you. I'd be too embarrassed. EVA (VOICEOVER): Oh, come on, it's just a game. MICHAEL (VOICEOVER): Well, I have had this fantasy. I've thought about you dancing for me. EVA (VOICEOVER): Dancing, like in a club? MICHAEL (VOICEOVER): No, just for me in private. EVA (VOICEOVER): Ah, I get it. MICHAEL (VOICEOVER): You're laughing at me. EVA (VOICEOVER): No, I'm not. Actually, I think it could be, kind of, fun. Grinding to the music-- MICHAEL (VOICEOVER): Your beautiful body, your clothes just drenched in sweat. EVA (VOICEOVER): It's almost like I'm wearing nothing at all. MICHAEL (VOICEOVER): You drive me crazy. [giggles] EVA (VOICEOVER): It's making me crazy, too, teasing you, watching you get hot, getting off on watching me. MICHAEL (VOICEOVER): Oh, baby, I can smell you, the heat of your body. I want you so bad. EVA (VOICEOVER): Go ahead. I won't bite. MICHAEL (VOICEOVER): I gotta feel you. I gotta feel your body next to mine. Oh, I wanna kiss you. EVA (VOICEOVER): The electric spark as our lips touch for the first time. Your lips on my body, your hands-- MICHAEL (VOICEOVER): God, you feel so good. EVA (VOICEOVER): Mm, I just want you like this forever. [music playing] I know you're mine. You're all mine. [crashing] Eleanor, it's Heather. I need to speak to Walter right away. Call if you need anything at all. All right. That was Heather. Apparently, some vandals got to her car. Oh, jeez. She all right? A little shaken up. This crazy city. Yeah, well, I guess we should go ahead with the meeting. Anderson, do you wanna make the presentation? Absolutely. All right, give me two seconds to set up. KENJI: Now, Walter, it's important that we come off-- [laughing] MICHAEL: That's-- that's-- that's quite a way of putting it. You've got a good one here, Walter. One of the brightest. Ken, my assistant will call you next week when everything is set. Terrific, Walter. And thank you, Michael. Ken, you are the best. Thanks for making this happen. We appreciate it. Whoo. Great save, bum. - Sharp look. - Eh? I met this really nice girl on the internet the other day, Jazz. She's into the whole music scene. I'm meeting her tomorrow. What do you think, eh? If you think you are happy, then do it. I decided to follow your lead. All this time, I've been lying and denying these ladies a chance to get to know what a swell guy I really am. Well, see that, Archie, it never really hurts to be yourself. Well, actually, I've decided my true self is named Steven. Hey, what's this? From your secret admirer. What the hell is this? ARCHIE: Whoo-hah. It's my watch. There's an inscription, "Forever, Roxanne." This is too weird. She shelled out some dough. MICHAEL: How the hell did she find me? I don't even know this woman. ARCHIE: It looks like she knows you. MICHAEL (VOICEOVER): I have to tell you something. I'd feel better about this if I could tell you face to face. EVA (VOICEOVER): I wish you were here, too, so we could do the things we're always talking about. [sighs] MICHAEL (VOICEOVER): It's not that. EVA (VOICEOVER): I think about all the time, your mouth on me, on my breasts, my stomach, my thighs. MICHAEL (VOICEOVER): You're not making this easy. [giggles] EVA (VOICEOVER): Searching, exploring, kissing me, loving me, how do I taste? [music playing] Michael, what are you doing up? MICHAEL: I just-- I couldn't sleep, honey. You look like you're out of breath. MICHAEL: Just, you startled me. I'm sorry. I don't like the way things have been between us lately. I know that I've been distant. And I never meant to hurt you. I'm just scared. Because of the baby. It's OK. It's OK. I'm scared, too. [sighs] You are going to be the most beautiful mother. You know that. EVA (VOICEOVER): Dear Michael, I was wondering if you got the present I bought for you. INSTRUCTOR: At this point, we're going to be taking our short breaths. Come on, let me blow. Stop. EVA (VOICEOVER): Hey, Michael, I just thought I'd drop you a line and see what you've been up to. You must be keeping busy. Michael, I haven't heard from you. Let's catch up soon. I'm really looking forward to meeting you in person. Me, too, I think you're brother and sister. EVA (VOICEOVER): Michael, I'll be waiting to hear from you tonight. Please don't let me down. [mail alarm] Michael, I'm starting to get a little worried about you. Are you OK? [beeping] All right, Michael, this is the last time I'm writing you. I want to hear from you, or else. [slams] [sighs] Hi. Hi. More upgrades? Yeah, yeah. Where is everybody? Lunch, and I'm just about to go out myself. Great. HEATHER: Is there something I can help you with? No, thank you. I'll just wait. Walter's kind of a stickler about people being in the office when no one's around. I don't think Walter would mind. HEATHER: He's been really stressed out lately. The littlest things just set him off. Maybe you can come back later. Miss, this is extremely important. HEATHER: It's not me. It's company policy. EVA: Huh. HEATHER: After you. Thank you. [mail alarm] EVA (VOICEOVER): Lose your sense of adventure, Mr. Explorer? EMILY (VOICEOVER): Excuse me? EVA (VOICEOVER): What the hell is your problem? EMILY (VOICEOVER): Are you sure you want Michael Anderson? EVA (VOICEOVER): You asshole, don't act like you don't know me. EMILY (VOICEOVER): What do you want? [scoffs] EVA (VOICEOVER): What do you think I want? Jeez. EMILY (VOICEOVER): I don't know. You seem angry. EVA (VOICEOVER): You're damn right. Where have you been? What happened to you the other night? EMILY (VOICEOVER): We were talking over the computer. EVA (VOICEOVER): If that's what you want to call it. EMILY (VOICEOVER): And we were interrupted. [scoffs] EVA (VOICEOVER): Why didn't you say anything? Why did you just sign off like that? EMILY (VOICEOVER): I don't think my wife would have understood. What? Wife? EMILY (VOICEOVER): Yes, wife. In fact, I can assure you of that because I am her. Who the hell are you? [slams] MICHAEL: All we did was talk. EMILY: But did you meet this woman? No. No, of course not. It was one conversation. How many other girls did you have one conversation with? None. Honey, it happened one time, I swear to you. And it's never going to happen again. Now, it's a computer. For Gods sake, sweetheart, it's not even real. Look, you're getting yourself all upset. [music playing] Damn it. Honey, what time is it? [moans] It's after 8:00? Jesus! - What? Damn it! Damn it! I'm supposed to be at a meeting right now. I'm supposed to be at work. The phone is dead. Did we sleep through an earthquake or something? Well, the power's on across the street. EMILY: We did pay the bill, right? Mr. Brooks, this is the proof sheet. I know it's a little bit out of order. But as soon as Michael gets here, he's going to explain the whole thing to you. I'm sorry. Power was out of my house. [slams] [beeping] [sighs] I'll be there. [beeping] [machine beeping] I don't know, Em. Try not using the credit cards. Somebody is obviously messing around with us here. I don't understand. Why would somebody do that? MICHAEL (ON PHONE): Who knows? I'll-- I'll have the police look into it. [mail alarm] EVA (VOICEOVER): I should have never given you so much credit. You bitch. Honey, I'm going have to call you back. EVA (VOICEOVER): You've lied to me. MICHAEL (VOICEOVER): I'm not going to argue with you. I want this to stop. EVA (VOICEOVER): I don't. MICHAEL (VOICEOVER): Roxanne, answer me, answer me. [slams] She's screwing with me. DETECTIVE: Look, sir, you don't even have a name. All you've got is some unpaid parking tickets and bills. And unfortunately, the only person who can be arrested for that is you. Wait a minute, I have her email address. DETECTIVE: But there's no evidence connecting this person to the crimes or even you to this person. So what-- what are you telling me, you don't believe me? I'm not saying that. Well, would you at least just check it out? Could you ask her to please stop? We'll look into it. Oh, God. She was pregnant the whole time. [sighs] ARCHIE: How does she do it? She seems to know everything about you. HEATHER: It has to be somebody that knows you. Like who? It's a neighbor, somebody that you come in contact with a lot. From the office? Oh, my God, it's Eleanor. Have a seat. In here? That's fine. OK. MICHAEL: So I assume you know exactly what I want to talk to you about. Well, I-- I don't know. I think you do. And you have to accept the fact that I'm married. And I love my wife. And this is all going to stop right now. And you know, I think it might be best even if you just collect your things, and you leave. I don't understand. What-- Deleting files, turning the power of in my house-- I don't understand what you're talking about. --messing with every single one of my personal accounts, this may all seem like a big practical joke to you. It's not. ELEANOR: No, I don't-- This is very serious stuff. I don't know what you're talking about. I didn't do anything to you. - Eleanor, come on. No, I swear. Why would I do something like that? You didn't? ELEANOR: No, I swear to God, I didn't. EMILY: Michael, can you come here for a minute? MICHAEL: What's up? When did we stay at the Los Alamos Motel? I thought you said you talked to the police about this. It's just a mix up. It's going to be straightened out real soon. We've already changed the account numbers. It's still happening. I think you should talk to them again. I'm handling it, OK? It's nothing for you to worry about. Is there something you're not telling me? No. You said you thought that someone was doing this, who? Nobody. I-- I don't know. Michael-- MICHAEL: Look, I'm under a lot of pressure right now. I don't need you doing this to me right now. Michael, Michael? ARCHIE: Mr. Brooks, Heather and I propose a massive radio campaign, something your product has never really been-- WALTER: Just a minute. You're late, Anderson. Walter, if this is about the other day, I can explain. KENJI: There's nothing to explain. Walter, I want him off my account now. You can't do that, sir. He can do anything he wants. He's the client. Heather and Archie will be taking over from now on. I see, congratulations. ARCHIE: Michael, it's not what you think. You have to understand-- Archie has been picking up a lot of your slack, Anderson. From what I can see, you should be thanking him that you still have a job. Yeah, I think I'll do that right after I pull this knife out of my bag. ARCHIE: Wait a minute, Michael, let me explain. He was going to give the account to somebody. Michael, I'm your best friend. MICHAEL: You sure have a hell of a way of showing it, you know that? That was my account. Michael, calm down. I'm not going to calm down! What was this, Heather's idea? Did she talk you into this, or was it something that the two of you schemed up behind my back? Thank you very much. Anderson, I think it would be best for all of us if you took a couple of days off. What? You heard what I said! Go home, cool off. Michael? The baby is kicking. Here, you wanna-- here, right there. [giggles] Neat, huh? Yeah. I'm sorry about before. No, don't you apologize. It was my fault. Well, you're being kind of a jerk. - You're right. - I'm kidding. I'm kidding. No, I was a jerk. I was a jerk. I was thinking, I-- I really can't go back to work. But I'm sure I could tutor part-time and bring in some extra money. Thank you. We're gonna be fine. INSTRUCTOR: Now, at this point, your partner should be coaching you along, maintaining your focus point, inhaling through the nose-- [inhales] [suspenseful music] [alarm beeping] Shit. [scoffs] [sighs] [cat meows] [chuckles] [singing] EMILY: OK, I can take those little things right here. MICHAEL: You are going to take nothing. Nothing. Nothing. But just hurry. EMILY: Are you OK? Aw, hurry, hurry with the keys. EVA: This won't hurt too much, Emily. [alarm beeps] MICHAEL: Oh-- [crashes] --jeez. All right, I'll help. No, I can-- you'll help? You can't barely tie your shoes. EMILY: Well, hand me something. Give me that. There you go. EMILY: OK. MICHAEL: Wait, here, take the mouthwash. Mouthwash, all right. I'll be right back. MICHAEL: OK. [toy squeaks] [grunts] Kitty? [computer beeps] [rattling] [cat meows] [screams] EMILY: Michael! Ah! Em! EMILY: Micheal! Emily! Emily! EMILY: Mike! - Em! EMILY: Michael, here! Em! Oh, God! Oh, my God! What happened? It's OK, honey. It's OK. [crying] It's OK. It's OK. It all happened so fast. I know that it was a woman. I didn't get a good look at her face, though. I'm going to give you a little shot to numb you up, ease the pain a little bit. She's allergic to Novocaine. So then you have no idea who could have done this? No. I know. I'm sorry. A few weeks ago, I met this woman. I-- I talked to her on-- on the computer-- on the internet and-- Can I-- can I get you something? Some tea? [sniffles] What are you doing? Emily, please don't leave. EMILY: You're in my way. Would you talk to me? Please, just talk to me. Now come on, don't-- no, don't do this. Don't go. Oh, I'm not going anywhere. Emily. Don't. I think you've lied enough, don't you? [music playing] [car engine starts] [suspenseful music] DETECTIVE: Look, we're doing all we can. But there were no prints. And your wife can't identify her. But that-- that psycho is still out there. We're running a check on the email address you gave us. I can understand what you're going through. But to tell you the truth, that Roxanne is probably long gone by now. Archie, I'm going to head out. Will you lock up? Archie? Hmm? Oh, yeah, yeah. What's wrong? I don't know. You know, I'm thinking, getting into someone's bank account is a pretty major feat. You can't just walk into a bank and withdraw someone else's money. Mm-hmm. Whoever that person is, they've got to have some technical know-how. You mean they hack their way in? Yeah. Eva, that woman who does our computers. [phone rings] Emily? We found her. We found Roxanne. - What? ARCHIE (ON PHONE): It's Eva, the computer girl. Heather's actually the one who put it all together. MICHAEL (ON PHONE): Oh, my God. Are you sure? ARCHIE (ON PHONE): Listen, it'll be easier to explain if I can show you. Can you get down to the office right away? I'm on my way. Oh! [slams] Yeah, that's right. You gotta get someone down here right away. His name is Michael Anderson. And I think he's gone crazy. Uh-huh. Uh-huh, yeah, I heard gunfire, please. My name is Heather Landau. I work here, yeah. Oh, God, no, he's coming! No, Michael, no! ARCHIE: No, no, no. Heather, this isn't adding up right. We have to re-crunch the numbers. [beeping] Damn it! The mainframe's crashed. All right, all right, I'll go check it out. No, I'll do it. Just stay here and keep trying to log back on. Archie? Arch? Oh, Jesus! Don't do that to me. ARCHIE: A little on edge, are we? Come on, show me. What's going on? OK, OK, Heather said Eva, that computer analyst, came in one day acting, kind of, weird. We decided to do a little hacking of our own and bingo, look, right here. It all makes sense now. That's how she got into everything. I'm making a hard list of everything she's done, your power, banking, accounts, all of it. She's been using your screen name Mike A. MICHAEL: So this is it. She must have a lot of time on her hands. ARCHIE: Tell me about it. You must have ticked her off real bad. MICHAEL: You know, never mind that. Why don't you just print everything out, and I'll be able to prove to the police exactly what she's been doing. ARCHIE: You got it. Just give me a couple of minutes here and let the old Brick do his magic. The mainframe is down. But I'll get you what you need. [gasps] [thuds] What was that? ARCHIE: I don't know. Heather's in the computer room trying to reboot the mainframe. Heather? You OK? I'd better go check-- No, I'll go. You-- you just stay here and keep being a genius. Heather? Pretty smart, but not quite smart enough to beat the old Brick. Heather? Think again. [gunshot] Archie! God! Arch! Arch! Oh, God! OK. [choking] Oh, God, hang on, Archie. Hang on, Arch. Hang on, buddy. [radio chatter] Our investigators hadn't found the printouts, all of the disk you mentioned. Well, she must have taken them with her. [radio chatter] We received a 911 call from a Heather Landau. She reported seeing you with a gun. [radio chatter] She said you were behaving erratically. What? I-- I never had-- Have you been drinking tonight? Look, I don't-- I don't understand. There was an emergency call from the victim. She clearly identified you. Well, there's gotta be some mistake because that doesn't make any sense, sir. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to come down to the station, answer a few questions. INSTRUCTOR: Now, at this point, your partner should be coaching you along, maintaining your focus point on the wall, inhaling through the nose [inhales] and exhaling through the mouth. [exhaling] There we go. EVA: Excuse me? INSTRUCTOR: In through the nose-- EVA: Hi, I noticed you didn't have a partner, either. Would you like to work together? INSTRUCTOR: --out through the mouth. Sure, sure. Great. INSTRUCTOR: Relaxation, in through the nose, [inhales] out through the mouth. MICHAEL: I saw a woman running out of that office. And it's the same woman who has been stalking me, the woman who attacked my wife. Now, you filled out that report yourself. DETECTIVE: Let me get this straight. You want us to believe that there's some connection between this and the incident at your home. Yes, I do. How many-- how many times do we have to go over this? Her name is Eva. We hired her to fix the computers at our offices. Now why can't you just go out there and find her and pick her up and question her. DETECTIVE: Then how do you explain that the gun involved, it would register in your name? What? Was it routine for you to keep a gun in the office? I don't own a gun. DETECTIVE: Registered to a Michael Anderson, your home address. It was purchased yesterday. Is that your signature? Yes, that's my signature. But don't you see what this woman is doing to me? She's setting me up! She must have hacked her way into the files somehow. DETECTIVE: We have witnesses to say you had a confrontation with the two deceased parties. This is not my gun. I don't own a gun! DETECTIVE: I have to inform you, you've been formally charged with first degree murder. Anything you say from now on may be used against you in the court of law. Thank you so much for giving me a ride. I'm going to have to talk to that mechanic. I just had my damn car tuned up last week. EVA: Oh, please, you could never trust those guys. AUTOMATED MESSAGE: You have no new messages. He didn't call? Pardon me? I've had that look on my face a number of times, and it can only mean one thing. Sweetie, do you want to talk about it? No. No, I'm fine. EVA: Oh, you poor thing. Hey, I just thought of something. You know what you need? You need a nice hot bath. I just bought some great aromatherapy oils. It's supposed to do wonders. What do you say? You've got to believe me. You know that I was being stalked. You know that my wife was attacked. Now can't you see what this woman is doing? Your bail hearing will be in a few hours. Oh, no, come on, can I-- can I least call my wife first, please? [phone ringing] Could you get that? OK! Hello? Hello? Michael, oh, don't worry, sweetheart. [giggles] She's in good hands. She-- she's there. [slams] You get someone down there right away! Haven't you just about played this record enough? The woman is insane. She killed two people. Get him out of here! You can't let her get away with this. If you think I'm lying, you check it out. You prove me wrong! Send a unit over to Anderson's house, yeah. [siren] Who was it? Just some telemarketing scam. Oh. [gasps] Honey, what is it? I think I should go to the hospital. [doorbell rings] [knocks] Mrs. Anderson? EMILY: Oh! Hello? Stand back. Wait, someone's coming to the door. Ma'am, are you all right? No, she's not all right. She's having a baby. Is there anything we can do? EVA: Yeah, just help me get into the car. OK. EVA: She's just a little scared. DETECTIVE: OK, thank you, yeah. Yeah, thanks. Your wife is OK. Thank God. You-- you found Eva? No. But I do have a little good news for you. Your wife is having a baby. You gotta let me out of here. Relax, our unit arrived just as they were leaving. We gave them an escort to the hospital. You gave-- them? What are you talking about them? Well, she had a friend with her. That was not a friend! You just let my wife at the hospital with that lunatic. Mr. Anderson! You gotta get back there! Mr. Anderson, I've taken all I'm going to take from you. Now you can see your wife after you make bail. But it could be too late. This woman killed two people. OK, let's get you settled in here. The doctor will be be right in. EMILY: OK. NURSE: That's right, just relax. I'll be right back with your gown. OK. Let me pull up those pillows up for you. Just a second, here you go. Thanks. EVA: OK. OFFICER: OK, Miss Hunter, time to go to jail. Let's go. WOMAN: Hey, get your hands off of me. Hey, get your hands off of me! Fucking bastard, get your hands off me, or I'm gonna screw your ass-- All right, you're welcome, come on. You, too, get out of here! OFFICER: I'll handle her. WOMAN: Hey! [screams] No! No! Get off of me, pigs! Get off! DETECTIVE: Hey! More of that. [groans] NURSE: Oh, you're doing great. It's not supposed to hurt this much, is it? DOCTOR: You might try taking a little walk, takes pressure off the back. But what about the epidural? DOCTOR: It's still too early. I'll be back and check on you in a few minutes, all right? You'll be fine. There he is! Come on, let's go! Get him! Here we go. Oh. Oh, another one? [groans] It's still 15 minutes apart, honey. Let's keep walking, OK? Come on. There you go. There you go. No, no, I need a break. I need a break. I gotta sit down. Freeze! Get out of the car, Anderson! Get out of the car! MAN: That's my car. That's my car, man. Hey, wait, that's my car! DETECTIVE: God damn it! Bastard! - Guys-- He's heading for the hospital. Radio ahead! I have a pizza to deliver. Then why did you leave your keys in the car? I'm-- DETECTIVE: Come on, radio ahead. Let's go! God! OK now. OK. So how are we doing? Still 10 minutes apart. NURSE: Still too soon for a shot. [gasping] Come on, can you please go get the doctor? She's in pain for Christ's sakes, please. Just breathe, honey, just breathe. Ma'am, can you tell me what room Emily Anderson is in? She's having a baby. Sir, there are a lot of people in front of you. Please, can you look it up for me? If you want help, you're going to have to wait your turn. Now, please take a seat. EMILY: How far apart are they now? DOCTOR: 6 minutes. I'll send in the anesthesiologist for your epidural. You'll be all right. Excuse me. OK, guys, let's spread out. Excuse me. Ma'am, I'm looking for Emily Anderson. She's having a baby. This is the ICU area. Yes, yes, I know that. Could you please help me? This is an emergency. Ma'am, I need one minute of your time, please, please. Can you help me, please? Please! NURSE: You're OK there. You're doing just fine. Now, I need to take your pulse. Freddie, go that way. OK, good. Now I need you to roll over on your side for me and hit your gown up. [beeping] Oh, come on. OK, now you're going to feel a little cold. That's right. You're doing just fine. [beeping] What? Jesus Christ. She's gonna send her in shock. NURSE: Just fine. Doctor. [screams] Stop! Emily! She's allergic to that shot. You'll kill her. Honey, are you OK? Yes. That's her! It's OK, Emily. Everything's going to be just fine. Do you need some ice? DOCTOR: Emily. - No. Look at me. Don't push, all right? Nice, deep breaths. Nice, deep breaths, in and out, nice and deep. We wanna watch what the monitor say. - OK, contraction begins. - Are we ready? Let's go. Emily, push. Emily, push, push! NURSE: Come on. [screaming] Come on, Emily, push, push, push! Attagirl! - Ah! - Push! You can push harder than that. Let's go. Attagirl, attagirl! [screams] Ouch! [crashes] [groans] [thuds] [groans] Come on now, push, Emily. Come on, Emily, push the baby, attagirl! [screams] [machine beeps] [screams] Harder, push, push! [screams] Push, push, push! Attagirl, push! Ah! No! DOCTOR: Let's go, push harder. Let go of me. Stop it, please. Push through the pain, Emily. Let's go. You sick bitch! [choking] [machine beeping] - Her heart rate is down. - What? What? What? Hold on. No, you're fine. You're fine. Wait, what's wrong with my baby? NURSE: All right, you should-- What? - We've got a wrapped cord here. - What? NURSE: It's OK. No, no, no, shh. DOCTOR: Everything is fine. [choking] It's OK. I got it. I got the-- I got it. Attagirl. [coughing] NURSE: Inhale, sweetie. DOCTOR: All right, cord's released. Fetal heart rate up? - Yes. DOCTOR: Heart rate back? [gasping] [screaming] Shit! Shit!

One more big push and you're going to have yourself a beautiful baby, all right? I said, don't move! Put it down! Put the knife down, now! Push, push, come on, the baby's coming. DETECTIVE: Put the knife down, now! Attagirl, attagirl! Scissors. [grunts] You have yourself a beautiful baby girl. [baby cries] [screams] [music playing] Hi. Michael. Can I come in? I am so sorry. I wish I knew. I don't know what to say. Oh, God, she's so beautiful. Emily, she's so beautiful. Can I? Careful, careful. Oh, baby. Oh, look. I'm so sorry. I love you. I love you, too. Oh, what a beautiful princess. [music playing]
