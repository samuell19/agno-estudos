Incident By A Bank A reconstruction of an actual event witnessed on June 26, 2006 - Did you find it? - What? - Did you find it? - Yeah... Christ, I thought someone had thrown it away. - Where was it? - Under our seats. I decided to check. I almost missed it. But when I was leaving, something caught my eye, you know. It was stuck there, between the seat and the wall. You know... Talk about dumb luck! - Oh no, where's my phone? - Want me to hold that? What the... No, it's cool. My lucky day. Hey, are those guys wearing ski masks? Like robbers? Henrik, check it out. That white stuff, sticking out from under their helmets... Nah... Seriously, it looks like they've got masks. - Think they're going to rob the bank? - I don't know. Wouldn't robbers use black masks? Those look like fireproof racing masks. That's just a moped... - What are you doing? - Back up... Get rid of it. Rip it off! It's all tangled... Just go. - What the hell are they up to? - Seriously... Holy shit! Shit... - I told you! - They've got guns. Seriously... Christ, I forgot my bag. For God's sake, be careful! Should we call the police, or what? - What the hell? - Henrik, Henrik... What the hell are they up to? Over there! It's over there! - Seriously... - Hey, over there! What's going on? Maybe we shouldn't be standing here... Are you filming this? Zoom in... - Seriously, they're shooting. - Not at us. Do you think the bullets know that? - Go on, zoom in more. - I can't... This should work the zoom, but nothing's happening. Look at my hand, it's shaking. Get out of here! Beat it! Shut up! Shut up and beat it! Go, go, go! Move it! Get him! - Do you need any help? - Easy, and you won't get hurt. - Can I help? - Stand back, please. I didn't do anything... I didn't do anything! - Easy! - I didn't do anything. - Really? What's this gun doing here? - I don't have a gun. - So it's not your gun? - No, it's not mine. - Are you okay? - I'm fine. Get the gun. Can you breathe? Stand back! - I didn't do anything... - Call for backup. - What did I say about ski masks? - Did he shoot the guy? This is unbelievable... This is fucking... Looks like they got one. - Did the other guy get away? - "I didn't do anything"... Holy shit! Shit, guns going off like that! Look, the film's pretty good. - The one you shot? - You can't see everything, but... - You can zoom in now, though. - Only then it goes all pixelly. Despite 8 mega pixels... Listen, we've got to go. Do you know how to get there? Seriously, these phones are crap! And they aren't exactly cheap! - A zoom is pretty basic, right? - You can zoom afterwards. Well, it's still not very good. It's like those new fighter planes... Easy... Take it easy and it won't hurt. - Stand back. - Move it, guys...
